1
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,028
I'm really sorry.
-About what?

2
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,313
Them dying.

3
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,755
I'm sorry about <how>they died.

4
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,158
Quiet down there!

5
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,917
A ten-meter fall would kill
any fish. They were perch.

6
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,997
I know your perch.

7
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,954
The cleaning staffjust
emptied my fish tank out the window.

8
00:05:55,441 --> 00:05:56,715
Presto!

9
00:05:57,121 --> 00:06:00,511
And the guards?
-Were carrying your piano, Mrs. Krüger.

10
00:06:01,441 --> 00:06:03,796
They're not allowed in.
-Mr. Kowalski?

11
00:06:04,001 --> 00:06:05,275
Yes?

12
00:06:05,561 --> 00:06:08,200
You can't be serious.
-But I am.

13
00:06:09,121 --> 00:06:13,080
We've registered.
-You, Mrs. Krüger, but not your escort.

14
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:15,511
They're not allowed in, really.

15
00:06:17,401 --> 00:06:19,596
These gentlemen are very nice.

16
00:06:20,361 --> 00:06:23,751
These gentlemen are trash.
And we can't let trash in.

17
00:06:24,081 --> 00:06:27,437
Not even nice trash.
-No wonder your wife left you.

18
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:53,999
What a pain in the neck.
-What do you mean?

19
00:06:57,801 --> 00:06:59,678
Oh, fucking hell...

20
00:07:15,721 --> 00:07:18,474
Where are the movers?
-They're outside.

21
00:07:18,681 --> 00:07:20,876
Warden...
-Just call me Meyerbeer.

22
00:07:21,121 --> 00:07:23,555
You permitted the delivery,
Mr. Meyerbeer.

23
00:07:23,761 --> 00:07:27,276
No, I didn't permit some ex-cons
to deliver your piano.

24
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:30,359
You must have known
that they're not allowed in.

25
00:07:30,561 --> 00:07:32,836
It was a matter of money.

26
00:07:33,321 --> 00:07:35,881
Why didn't you tell me, Mrs. Krüger?

27
00:07:36,201 --> 00:07:38,590
Money matters can be solved.

28
00:07:39,201 --> 00:07:42,989
My salary was cut three years ago.
I pay the piano tuners

29
00:07:43,241 --> 00:07:45,471
and buy new instruments myself.

30
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:50,072
The only money matters you've solved
concerned your perch.

31
00:07:50,281 --> 00:07:53,910
Stay objective.
-I just worry about my students.

32
00:07:57,121 --> 00:07:58,395
Four.

33
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:02,993
Excuse me?
-Four. You have four students.

34
00:08:03,281 --> 00:08:06,956
One hanged herself last night,
and the other is Mütze.

35
00:08:07,241 --> 00:08:10,278
Which is nice for him,
but we were hoping...

36
00:08:10,801 --> 00:08:12,871
... he'd act like a prison officer.

37
00:08:16,001 --> 00:08:18,231
<Piano, you are pretty free!>

38
00:08:18,841 --> 00:08:20,833
<So please be still and listen>

39
00:08:22,282 --> 00:08:25,911
<i>because Ms. Krüger wants to see
you brand-new in the prison.</i>

40
00:08:26,122 --> 00:08:27,840
Thank you, Mr. Mütze.

41
00:08:30,922 --> 00:08:33,595
You're starting to
show your true colors.

42
00:08:33,802 --> 00:08:35,679
Mrs. Krüger...

43
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:37,952
You have every right to insult me.

44
00:08:38,162 --> 00:08:40,960
But keep in mind
that we have 300 prisoners.

45
00:08:41,162 --> 00:08:44,871
You have an office, a piano room,
and only four students...

46
00:08:45,882 --> 00:08:50,273
Some people have asked me to cut
the piano room altogether.

47
00:08:52,522 --> 00:08:55,912
You remind me of someone, warden.
-Meyerbeer...

48
00:08:56,162 --> 00:08:59,313
My first warden
also refused to be called warden.

49
00:08:59,722 --> 00:09:02,998
Head of penitentiary?
-<SS-Sturmbannführer>.

50
00:09:11,162 --> 00:09:14,393
You've been here for a long time,
Mrs. Krüger.

51
00:09:35,562 --> 00:09:37,757
Interested in piano lessons?

52
00:09:38,522 --> 00:09:40,638
Piano lessons?

53
00:09:42,442 --> 00:09:43,875
Take one.

54
00:09:45,282 --> 00:09:46,761
There you go.

55
00:10:05,362 --> 00:10:06,954
I am certain

56
00:10:07,322 --> 00:10:09,438
that neither death nor life,

57
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:12,202
neither angels nor mighty powers,

58
00:10:12,802 --> 00:10:15,521
neither the present nor the future,

59
00:10:15,722 --> 00:10:19,795
neither higher nor lower goods,
nor another creature

60
00:10:20,002 --> 00:10:24,712
can separate us from the love of God
that resides in our Lord Jesus Christ.

61
00:10:24,922 --> 00:10:26,275
Amen.

62
00:10:32,922 --> 00:10:35,311
We mourn the deceased.

63
00:10:35,962 --> 00:10:38,601
We will now hear
her favorite sonata.

64
00:10:39,162 --> 00:10:40,959
Mozart's <A major>.

65
00:12:23,803 --> 00:12:26,681
So you didn't notice anything
last night?

66
00:12:26,883 --> 00:12:28,555
Ayse, she's new.

67
00:12:28,883 --> 00:12:32,034
Stay out of it, Frankie,
This is adults talking.

68
00:12:32,603 --> 00:12:33,877
So...

69
00:12:34,323 --> 00:12:37,201
You didn't notice anything?
-I was sleeping.

70
00:12:38,283 --> 00:12:40,239
You were sleeping?

71
00:12:42,003 --> 00:12:43,721
She was sleeping.

72
00:12:46,603 --> 00:12:48,719
You sure sleep well, huh?

73
00:12:49,203 --> 00:12:52,195
Don't even notice
someone biting the dust next to you.

74
00:12:53,923 --> 00:12:55,675
You know what I think?

75
00:12:58,483 --> 00:13:00,474
You didn't sleep at all.

76
00:13:00,763 --> 00:13:03,152
You let her dangle, didn't you?

77
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,721
You're just the type.

78
00:13:06,003 --> 00:13:08,961
You'd steal the last smoke
from a corpse.

79
00:13:11,644 --> 00:13:13,874
Are you cross-eyed?

80
00:13:17,324 --> 00:13:19,121
You'll get yours, Jenny.

81
00:13:20,324 --> 00:13:21,803
Don't touch me.

82
00:13:25,124 --> 00:13:27,433
I said, don't touch!
-Quiet!

83
00:13:57,364 --> 00:13:59,514
The new students are waiting.

84
00:14:01,804 --> 00:14:05,319
<i>The smell of lilac,
so mild, so strong and full...</i>

85
00:14:10,244 --> 00:14:14,476
Hans Sachs in <Meistersinger>?
-<She loved me for the dangers I'd pass'd>

86
00:14:14,684 --> 00:14:18,154
<and I loved her that she did pity them.>
That's Othello.

87
00:14:18,644 --> 00:14:20,999
<May you find peace in death...>

88
00:14:22,124 --> 00:14:23,876
<May you find peace...?>

89
00:14:25,524 --> 00:14:27,321
<May you find peace...?>

90
00:14:27,644 --> 00:14:29,919
That's a tough one.
-Study, Mr. Mütze.

91
00:14:30,124 --> 00:14:32,240
<i>Or you'll never get anywhere.</i>

92
00:14:32,564 --> 00:14:34,520
Puccini?
-Puccini!

93
00:14:35,044 --> 00:14:37,683
No?
-Let the ladies enter.

94
00:14:41,764 --> 00:14:42,992
Go on.

95
00:14:58,884 --> 00:15:00,442
Press it?

96
00:15:01,124 --> 00:15:02,796
Yes.

97
00:16:15,365 --> 00:16:17,560
Your hands are sore.
-A little.

98
00:16:17,765 --> 00:16:20,199
What happened?
-None of your business.

99
00:16:23,245 --> 00:16:25,679
You want to play piano
with those hands?

100
00:16:26,925 --> 00:16:29,200
They're the only hands I've got.

101
00:16:32,765 --> 00:16:34,483
Get her out.

102
00:16:35,005 --> 00:16:36,802
Sure, Mrs. Krüger, but...

103
00:16:37,605 --> 00:16:40,165
... I think she's talented.
-Right now!

104
00:16:40,725 --> 00:16:42,397
Enny von Loeben...
-Jenny.

105
00:16:42,645 --> 00:16:44,397
It says here she's musical.

106
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:50,276
And my piano lesson?
-I'm sure you can do without.

107
00:16:50,525 --> 00:16:52,117
What's your problem?

108
00:16:52,885 --> 00:16:55,160
Young lady, watch your manners.

109
00:16:55,405 --> 00:16:56,679
What?

110
00:16:57,525 --> 00:17:01,837
I can't play because of my hands?
Fuck that fascist shit!

111
00:17:02,245 --> 00:17:04,918
Don't touch me.
I said, don't touch.

112
00:17:05,165 --> 00:17:06,154
Let's go.

113
00:17:09,325 --> 00:17:11,395
Fucking shit!

114
00:19:47,326 --> 00:19:48,805
Go ahead.

115
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,399
I, uh...

116
00:20:25,686 --> 00:20:28,042
I don't know
where you learned your skills.

117
00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:29,880
Fuck off!

118
00:20:30,087 --> 00:20:31,918
And I don't really care.

119
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,197
That negro music is worthless.

120
00:20:39,327 --> 00:20:40,726
But...

121
00:20:42,967 --> 00:20:44,798
... it was still...

122
00:20:45,367 --> 00:20:46,720
... unusual.

123
00:20:50,567 --> 00:20:52,956
God must have given you
something special.

124
00:20:58,327 --> 00:21:01,603
I think you're despicable,
you should know that...

125
00:21:04,087 --> 00:21:05,725
... but you have a gift.

126
00:21:09,087 --> 00:21:12,636
And you have the obligation
to preserve that gift.

127
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:20,283
Once you've paid for
what you did to the people here today...

128
00:21:24,847 --> 00:21:27,361
... I can offer you my help.

129
00:21:30,727 --> 00:21:33,844
This help will not concern you
as a person.

130
00:21:38,687 --> 00:21:41,121
I can help you become a better pianist.

131
00:21:43,407 --> 00:21:45,796
But I can't make you a better person.

132
00:21:47,367 --> 00:21:49,278
Think it over.

133
00:23:28,848 --> 00:23:30,520
Did we wake you up?

134
00:23:30,808 --> 00:23:32,844
This is no time for sleeping.

135
00:23:36,768 --> 00:23:38,440
Dad still can't speak well.

136
00:23:38,648 --> 00:23:40,240
That's Clara.
-I'm Clara.

137
00:23:41,328 --> 00:23:44,718
Well, Clara, can you do a nice curtsy?

138
00:23:47,608 --> 00:23:50,042
That's a pity.

139
00:24:05,568 --> 00:24:07,445
Is that your husband?

140
00:24:08,288 --> 00:24:10,563
I don't have a husband, honey.

141
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,365
Is he dead?

142
00:24:15,768 --> 00:24:17,406
No, Clara.

143
00:24:18,048 --> 00:24:21,484
<I devoted my life to beauty alone...>

144
00:24:28,168 --> 00:24:29,806
Tosca in <Tosca>.

145
00:24:30,128 --> 00:24:32,961
<This image is magically beautiful...>

146
00:24:35,968 --> 00:24:37,242
What?

147
00:24:39,568 --> 00:24:41,957
Tamino in <The Magic Hoot>.

148
00:24:42,528 --> 00:24:44,086
<The Magic Flute.>

149
00:24:45,128 --> 00:24:47,164
<And you shall be...>

150
00:24:52,448 --> 00:24:55,997
<And you shall be my Lord.>
Arabella in <Arabella>.

151
00:24:58,608 --> 00:25:00,758
Dad's going to be on TV.

152
00:25:01,008 --> 00:25:03,647
So all the studying was of some use.

153
00:25:05,288 --> 00:25:07,244
We all miss you terribly.

154
00:25:20,729 --> 00:25:24,358
How's that woman?
You know who, says Dad.

155
00:25:24,729 --> 00:25:27,323
She will be severely punished.

156
00:25:32,969 --> 00:25:35,529
Dad's going to kick her ass
when he returns.

157
00:25:57,169 --> 00:26:02,607
The words 'sorry,' 'please' and
'thank you' are missing in your letter.

158
00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:05,045
Sorry. Please. Thank you.

159
00:26:10,449 --> 00:26:13,885
Eat it.
-You want me to eat the letter?

160
00:26:14,089 --> 00:26:15,647
Eat it.
-Why?

161
00:26:15,889 --> 00:26:19,438
Rule number one.
-What'll rule number two make me eat?

162
00:26:20,889 --> 00:26:23,608
The lesson I have to offer you
requires humility.

163
00:26:23,809 --> 00:26:28,405
Humility is rule number one.
You'll do what I say and no complaining.

164
00:26:28,689 --> 00:26:30,998
Not with words or glances.
Never.

165
00:26:31,649 --> 00:26:34,561
You want me to be
your whimpering slave?

166
00:26:39,729 --> 00:26:41,720
Well, okay then.

167
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:45,166
Hello! All right, I got it.
It's a deal.

168
00:26:48,209 --> 00:26:49,927
Sit back down.

169
00:26:50,849 --> 00:26:52,362
Sit down.

170
00:26:56,009 --> 00:26:57,283
Please.

171
00:27:00,209 --> 00:27:02,404
I'll be your whimpering slave.

172
00:27:12,649 --> 00:27:15,402
Rule number two: your hands.

173
00:27:16,289 --> 00:27:18,849
You'll need them, so stop that.

174
00:27:21,889 --> 00:27:23,720
Rule number three: you smell.

175
00:27:23,969 --> 00:27:27,166
I don't want to sit next to someone
who doesn't wash.

176
00:27:29,609 --> 00:27:32,328
Rule number four: the contest.

177
00:27:34,289 --> 00:27:35,722
What contest?

178
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:41,283
There's a piano contest
for upcoming talents under 21

179
00:27:41,489 --> 00:27:43,684
and I want you to reach the finals.

180
00:27:43,889 --> 00:27:46,245
The girl deserves a chance.
-Yes.

181
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,327
That brat?
-Dieter, why not?

182
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:51,966
Don't call me Dieter.
She knocked Mütze out for weeks,

183
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:56,925
she's under strict confinement,
and you'd let her hit the keys all day?

184
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:01,043
Is thatjust?
-Always consider the specific situation.

185
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:04,003
Oh, give me a break!
-You're so bullheaded.

186
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:07,247
Mr. Kowalski, let your wife finish.
-Ex-wife!

187
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:13,799
We should support Jenny.
Her bio shows interferences...

188
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:17,838
Interferences?
She basically slaughtered the guy...

189
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:19,608
Wait a minute!
Let's not...

190
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:21,886
He's right, though!

191
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:25,044
Please, please, please!

192
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:28,968
We're all adults.

193
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:32,447
Mrs. Hofmann.
-Thanks.

194
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:36,761
Jenny has no contact to
her family or anyone outside.

195
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:39,365
Not that she seems to care to.

196
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:43,205
She has no psychological parent
and no perspective.

197
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,368
So what do you suggest?

198
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:49,044
A few piano lessons.
-Where will it lead us!

199
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:52,799
Mr. Kowalski...
-Listen, I represent all the officers

200
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:56,798
and employees of this prison.
Where will it lead us

201
00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:00,082
if we reward the perpetrators?
-It's useless.

202
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:04,602
She almost kills a guard,
and then gets to play happy tunes.

203
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:06,966
That simply can't be!

204
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:10,449
Mrs. Krüger...

205
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:15,168
I don't know...

206
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:18,726
How successful could
the inmate be in the contest?

207
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:21,041
She could win first prize.

208
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:26,367
Which would be
a success for all of us.

209
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:30,726
And, of course,
a personal victory for you.

210
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,483
Mr. Meyerbeer.

211
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:39,768
What's in it for me?

212
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,009
Rule number five:

213
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:44,967
This is not about you.

214
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:51,959
When I was that kid's age,
I performed in New York and Amsterdam.

215
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:55,765
At ten I had played
numerous international contests.

216
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,966
Half of which I won.

217
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:02,128
My adoptive father
tried to turn me into Mozart.

218
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:05,169
When I quit at twelve,
he fucked me senseless.

219
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:08,800
So I don't really feel like
some stupid contest.

220
00:30:11,251 --> 00:30:14,687
Then it might be best
to go back to rule number one.

221
00:30:40,731 --> 00:30:42,130
Good morning.

222
00:30:45,451 --> 00:30:48,841
I call all my students
by their first name.

223
00:30:49,491 --> 00:30:52,369
If you don't mind.
-No problem. I'm Jenny.

224
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:55,009
Sit down, Jenny.

225
00:30:55,411 --> 00:30:58,084
Let's start with something easy.

226
00:30:58,291 --> 00:31:01,647
Schubert's Impromptu No. 2

227
00:31:02,811 --> 00:31:04,369
in A flat major.

228
00:31:04,731 --> 00:31:07,450
Let's take a look at your technique.

229
00:31:09,971 --> 00:31:11,563
We'd like to start.

230
00:31:12,051 --> 00:31:13,325
Go ahead.

231
00:31:14,651 --> 00:31:16,004
Mr. Kowalski?

232
00:31:16,451 --> 00:31:17,520
Yes?

233
00:31:17,731 --> 00:31:19,687
Take off her handcuffs.

234
00:31:19,891 --> 00:31:23,440
The inmate's handcuffs have to stay.

235
00:31:23,651 --> 00:31:26,245
That's ridiculous.
-Sorry.

236
00:31:26,611 --> 00:31:29,330
Those are the rules.
-That's nonsense.

237
00:31:29,651 --> 00:31:32,324
How am I supposed to
teach her like that?

238
00:31:33,771 --> 00:31:36,239
It's for your personal safety.

239
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:39,610
So we'll...

240
00:31:40,891 --> 00:31:43,610
... read music.
You can read music...

241
00:31:47,491 --> 00:31:49,288
...can't you?
-Yes.

242
00:31:51,411 --> 00:31:53,606
So, what's the time signature?

243
00:31:53,851 --> 00:31:55,364
Three-four.
-Good.

244
00:31:55,571 --> 00:31:59,120
I'll play the quarter notes
and you sing the melody.

245
00:31:59,531 --> 00:32:01,123
One, two...

246
00:32:03,211 --> 00:32:06,044
Mr. Kowalski?
-You need to step back a bit.

247
00:32:06,531 --> 00:32:09,921
If I step back,
she can't read the music anymore.

248
00:32:10,451 --> 00:32:12,646
One meter distance.
-Why?

249
00:32:12,891 --> 00:32:15,007
Because of your hand.
-What about it?

250
00:32:15,211 --> 00:32:17,281
She could bite you.

251
00:32:18,731 --> 00:32:21,484
Jenny, are you planning to bite my hand?

252
00:32:23,091 --> 00:32:24,649
No.

253
00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:29,571
She even bites her own hand.

254
00:32:41,332 --> 00:32:43,163
Who do you think I am?

255
00:32:44,332 --> 00:32:46,971
It all depends how far she gets.

256
00:32:54,012 --> 00:32:56,207
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

257
00:33:02,012 --> 00:33:04,890
But I can't speak for
the editorial department.

258
00:33:18,812 --> 00:33:20,291
Mrs. Krüger,

259
00:33:20,972 --> 00:33:23,122
meet Mr. Wahrich from <Der Spiegel. >

260
00:33:25,372 --> 00:33:29,729
Please be nice to the press.
He's writing a piece about our prison.

261
00:33:29,972 --> 00:33:32,088
I have to teach now.

262
00:33:32,652 --> 00:33:34,927
Could she play something for us?

263
00:33:35,132 --> 00:33:36,804
Not yet.
-Please!

264
00:33:37,612 --> 00:33:40,445
We're still reading music.
-So read music.

265
00:33:40,652 --> 00:33:42,005
No.

266
00:33:43,932 --> 00:33:45,206
Four.

267
00:33:49,372 --> 00:33:50,885
Go ahead.

268
00:33:55,772 --> 00:33:57,808
Then I need my handcuffs.

269
00:34:01,212 --> 00:34:03,407
I've only played with handcuffs so far.

270
00:34:03,612 --> 00:34:06,285
I like the handcuffs idea.
-Yeah, me too.

271
00:34:06,492 --> 00:34:08,210
Handcuffed, then?

272
00:34:13,212 --> 00:34:15,282
Behind the back, please.

273
00:34:19,092 --> 00:34:20,969
Sure... behind the back.

274
00:35:22,293 --> 00:35:25,569
Don't you ever...
play that negro music again!

275
00:35:31,573 --> 00:35:33,484
What?
-Negro music.

276
00:35:34,093 --> 00:35:36,527
What the fuck!
That's what I like.

277
00:35:54,093 --> 00:35:56,846
Are you sorry, at least?
-Yes.

278
00:35:58,653 --> 00:36:00,609
Yes, I'm sorry.

279
00:36:10,653 --> 00:36:12,052
Good.

280
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:25,289
Oh, God.
Those are the wrong ones.

281
00:38:27,174 --> 00:38:29,813
Did you know there's trumpetfish?

282
00:38:30,014 --> 00:38:32,767
And fiddlefish?
Even drumfish?

283
00:38:33,854 --> 00:38:36,084
Enough for a whole orchestra.

284
00:38:37,174 --> 00:38:39,290
She does have small hands.

285
00:38:39,934 --> 00:38:43,609
If there was a pianofish,
it'd look like your daughter.

286
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:45,651
You as her dad can be proud.

287
00:38:46,734 --> 00:38:49,851
The contest tomorrow
will be a piece of cake for her.

288
00:38:50,134 --> 00:38:52,329
It's only the first round.

289
00:38:52,974 --> 00:38:54,726
Will you be there?

290
00:38:54,934 --> 00:38:57,323
I mean, incognito, of course.

291
00:39:12,694 --> 00:39:15,652
Is she in civilian clothes?
-Of course.

292
00:39:17,134 --> 00:39:20,604
Is she clean?
-Sorry, I didn't try to sniff on her.

293
00:39:59,575 --> 00:40:02,294
What are those?
-Civilian clothes.

294
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:06,849
We have to buy her clothes.
-Not permitted.

295
00:40:07,055 --> 00:40:10,092
Forget it.
-A sweater, some pants, shoes...

296
00:40:10,855 --> 00:40:13,608
In this outfit we don't even have to go.

297
00:40:15,335 --> 00:40:17,371
Then let's go back to prison.

298
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:27,206
Oh, no.
-Oh, yes.

299
00:40:28,095 --> 00:40:29,813
No way.

300
00:40:30,975 --> 00:40:32,488
Take off yourjacket.

301
00:40:33,335 --> 00:40:35,212
Take off your coat.

302
00:40:50,895 --> 00:40:52,453
It's your turn.

303
00:40:53,975 --> 00:40:57,092
Should I put down my stipends?
-Yes, all of them.

304
00:40:57,335 --> 00:41:00,566
I'm a master student.
-Put it down.

305
00:41:00,775 --> 00:41:02,925
Are you a master student, too?
-No, I'm a killer.

306
00:41:03,135 --> 00:41:06,411
Put it down.
You never know what it's good for.

307
00:41:18,255 --> 00:41:20,530
Let those losers fight it out.

308
00:41:20,855 --> 00:41:23,005
It doesn't get my nipples hard.

309
00:41:25,295 --> 00:41:28,492
We're here now...
and we'll see this through.

310
00:41:28,735 --> 00:41:31,090
No, we won't, you fucking cunt!

311
00:41:38,735 --> 00:41:42,125
You're scared.
-Yeah, sure, I'm scared.

312
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:44,411
Oh, I'm so scared!

313
00:41:44,615 --> 00:41:48,085
That's normal.
The guy in there's scared, too.

314
00:41:48,615 --> 00:41:51,732
As he should be.
He's got no talent at all.

315
00:41:53,255 --> 00:41:56,884
With you it's different.
-Spare me the psycho babble.

316
00:42:03,575 --> 00:42:07,090
If you don't make it here today,
you'll never make it.

317
00:42:07,695 --> 00:42:10,255
Stop it.
-Then you're a coward, Jenny.

318
00:42:10,455 --> 00:42:12,525
I said, stop it.
-A coward.

319
00:42:12,735 --> 00:42:14,248
I warn you.
-A coward.

320
00:42:14,455 --> 00:42:17,015
Shut your fucking mouth!

321
00:44:54,217 --> 00:44:57,573
We have to stop at a hospital
before we get back.

322
00:44:58,417 --> 00:45:02,205
<i>So l took them to a hospital,
because of the girl's hands.</i>

323
00:45:04,937 --> 00:45:06,928
I could slap myself.

324
00:45:10,257 --> 00:45:11,656
You see?

325
00:45:12,257 --> 00:45:14,009
I'm a man of principles.

326
00:45:14,537 --> 00:45:17,973
Then I made one exception...
and got screwed.

327
00:45:19,177 --> 00:45:21,054
And I always tell my children,

328
00:45:21,857 --> 00:45:24,894
''Don't trust anyone.
Don't help anyone.

329
00:45:25,497 --> 00:45:30,571
Don't give anything to anyone.''
And then I don't even stick to my rules.

330
00:46:18,017 --> 00:46:20,406
I didn't think you'd be so stupid.

331
00:46:23,017 --> 00:46:25,736
Maybe you're not stupid, butjust...

332
00:46:29,337 --> 00:46:31,453
Oh, I don't know.

333
00:46:33,337 --> 00:46:36,329
What if the window had broken?

334
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:39,368
Nice view, huh?

335
00:46:45,737 --> 00:46:48,649
Today you did something extraordinary.

336
00:46:50,097 --> 00:46:52,088
And then you ruin it all.

337
00:46:54,377 --> 00:46:56,208
What is it with you?

338
00:46:58,777 --> 00:47:01,245
I knew the window would't break.

339
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:17,808
I ran into it before,
when my baby was born.

340
00:47:18,018 --> 00:47:19,895
Two or three stories up,

341
00:47:20,378 --> 00:47:22,733
where the view is even nicer.

342
00:47:25,618 --> 00:47:28,052
I was in labor for sixteen hours.

343
00:47:29,218 --> 00:47:33,177
When I told the doctor that I...
that I couldn't take it anymore,

344
00:47:34,178 --> 00:47:38,012
he said that I was just a con
trying to stay out of prison.

345
00:47:38,698 --> 00:47:42,008
They should have done a Cesarian.

346
00:47:45,498 --> 00:47:47,932
But they didn't.

347
00:47:49,578 --> 00:47:51,648
They just let me tear.

348
00:47:53,578 --> 00:47:55,375
I blacked out.

349
00:47:55,578 --> 00:47:58,376
When I woke up, the nurse said to me...

350
00:48:01,818 --> 00:48:03,410
''Your baby...

351
00:48:04,858 --> 00:48:07,008
Your baby is gone.

352
00:48:08,258 --> 00:48:10,135
It's just gone.''

353
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:13,494
Circulatory collapse.

354
00:48:16,498 --> 00:48:18,329
His name was Oskar.

355
00:48:22,938 --> 00:48:24,417
Shit...

356
00:48:27,298 --> 00:48:30,415
Three hours later
they took me back to jail.

357
00:48:35,938 --> 00:48:37,735
Nice name, Oskar.

358
00:50:41,859 --> 00:50:44,134
Why do you stop?
-That was good.

359
00:50:46,339 --> 00:50:48,455
Are you kidding?
-I need a break.

360
00:50:48,699 --> 00:50:51,577
No, you don't.
-What's wrong with a break?

361
00:50:51,779 --> 00:50:54,612
You've had a three-year break.
Start again.

362
00:50:56,659 --> 00:50:59,298
I've been here for two hours.
-So have I.

363
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:02,578
Let's hear it.

364
00:51:02,859 --> 00:51:04,372
Come on!

365
00:51:07,699 --> 00:51:09,212
''Come on!''

366
00:51:11,979 --> 00:51:14,254
Jenny...
-Mrs. Krüger...

367
00:51:15,019 --> 00:51:17,328
Please, Jenny, concentrate!

368
00:51:32,699 --> 00:51:34,257
Pardon me.

369
00:51:52,539 --> 00:51:54,052
I'm sorry.

370
00:51:58,899 --> 00:52:01,015
I should have said something.

371
00:52:01,299 --> 00:52:04,656
She's playing Beethoven for you.
-Well, she's talented.

372
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:08,370
See how talented she is?

373
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:11,858
It's nothing personal,
we're just practicing.

374
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:14,489
She's going to play in a contest.

375
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:16,499
Me, too.

376
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:19,535
Tomorrow night, in color.

377
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:24,332
Remember?

378
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:43,133
<i>And this, ladies and gentlemen,
brings us to the last question,</i>

379
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:46,179
<which can still turn the game around.>

380
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:48,571
<Maybe you'll make it this time.>

381
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:52,898
<i>Listen carefully, here it comes:
the jackpot question.</i>

382
00:52:56,740 --> 00:53:02,372
<i>If Mozart had written
an opera for Cinderella...</i>

383
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:06,130
<i>... it would have resulted in
what kind of cheese?</i>

384
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:17,132
<But Mozart never...>

385
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:20,657
<i>Why cheese...?
-Had Mozart written an opera</i>

386
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:25,092
<i>for Cinderella, it would have resulted
in what cheese? -Mozzarella.</i>

387
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:27,894
<i>This answer,
ladies and gentlemen, is...</i>

388
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,692
<... correct!>

389
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,929
Look who's back.

390
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:56,051
Inspection.
Get up.

391
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:58,773
Get up!

392
00:54:35,181 --> 00:54:37,217
You know what this means?

393
00:54:38,621 --> 00:54:40,259
Good luck?

394
00:54:43,381 --> 00:54:45,178
Bug infestation.

395
00:54:46,781 --> 00:54:49,170
We're going to have to move you.

396
00:54:50,741 --> 00:54:53,653
And I happen to know
a nice place for you.

397
00:54:55,421 --> 00:54:57,981
You like it here?
Is it okay for you?

398
00:54:58,741 --> 00:55:00,971
It's a good place to meet people.

399
00:55:01,781 --> 00:55:04,693
Listen,
you can do whatever you want here.

400
00:55:04,941 --> 00:55:06,340
It's like a playground.

401
00:55:06,541 --> 00:55:09,135
But there's one thing
you should never do.

402
00:55:09,341 --> 00:55:11,297
The thing you do best.

403
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:13,338
Play piano.

404
00:55:15,661 --> 00:55:17,174
No, sleep.

405
00:55:41,341 --> 00:55:43,536
You'll be more famous than him.

406
00:55:45,221 --> 00:55:46,734
Much bigger.

407
00:55:47,061 --> 00:55:48,972
I really believe in you.

408
00:55:49,621 --> 00:55:52,772
They'll shave your head, too.
-No, they won't.

409
00:55:55,141 --> 00:55:57,701
This summer I'll be out here
with a pony.

410
00:55:57,901 --> 00:55:59,380
And if not?

411
00:56:04,261 --> 00:56:05,740
Then not.

412
00:56:11,221 --> 00:56:12,893
Damn you...
-Stop it!

413
00:56:18,981 --> 00:56:20,619
Is our time up?

414
00:56:34,781 --> 00:56:37,579
Let's take a short break.
-I don't want to.

415
00:56:37,781 --> 00:56:39,499
But you need one.

416
00:56:43,141 --> 00:56:45,894
Strange how hard it is for both of us...

417
00:56:46,621 --> 00:56:47,895
What?

418
00:56:48,901 --> 00:56:50,698
... to be friendly.

419
00:57:05,222 --> 00:57:06,701
Is it for me?

420
00:57:06,942 --> 00:57:08,421
It's for tomorrow.

421
00:57:09,022 --> 00:57:10,819
So it's for you.

422
00:57:11,182 --> 00:57:12,979
For whomever.

423
00:57:15,262 --> 00:57:16,536
Thanks.

424
00:57:16,942 --> 00:57:18,819
Did you apologize?

425
00:57:19,262 --> 00:57:21,253
To whom?
-You know who.

426
00:57:36,702 --> 00:57:38,932
Try to relax.
-I am relaxed.

427
00:57:40,862 --> 00:57:42,500
I'll go check.

428
00:58:24,382 --> 00:58:25,656
Sorry.

429
00:58:44,342 --> 00:58:45,934
You're up, Jenny!

430
00:58:48,222 --> 00:58:50,213
Are you relaxed?
-Yes.

431
00:59:00,022 --> 00:59:01,740
You were sensational.

432
00:59:02,942 --> 00:59:04,580
You were wonderful.

433
00:59:06,462 --> 00:59:08,817
I knew that you would make it big,

434
00:59:09,262 --> 00:59:11,617
even before you beat him up.

435
00:59:12,902 --> 00:59:15,416
It was a joke, Mr. Mütze.
Jesus...

436
00:59:15,862 --> 00:59:17,341
I'm sorry.

437
00:59:18,742 --> 00:59:20,859
You apologized, didn't you?

438
00:59:21,623 --> 00:59:23,022
Yes.

439
00:59:23,863 --> 00:59:25,899
So let's bury the hatchet.

440
00:59:26,703 --> 00:59:28,614
Let's drink to that.

441
00:59:29,343 --> 00:59:33,382
I thought you didn't drink.
-You're right. I don't drink.

442
00:59:39,703 --> 00:59:43,662
I'll always respect him, but...
he does get on my nerves.

443
00:59:45,383 --> 00:59:46,862
Like I do?

444
00:59:47,303 --> 00:59:49,612
No, you don't get on my nerves.

445
00:59:53,023 --> 00:59:54,775
Okay, I'll say it first.

446
00:59:55,703 --> 00:59:59,298
And I never even said it
to people I've slept with.

447
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:04,020
I like you.

448
01:00:07,623 --> 01:00:09,136
And you?

449
01:00:09,623 --> 01:00:11,454
Do you like me?

450
01:00:20,023 --> 01:00:22,457
Did you understand my question?

451
01:00:22,663 --> 01:00:24,221
I'm not deaf!

452
01:00:42,383 --> 01:00:43,736
No...

453
01:00:48,703 --> 01:00:51,661
You're in the final round.
Practice...

454
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:55,213
Don't let it get to your head...

455
01:00:56,663 --> 01:00:58,733
Pretend it's nothing...

456
01:01:03,543 --> 01:01:04,692
Yes...

457
01:01:19,983 --> 01:01:22,019
One last question, please.

458
01:01:22,263 --> 01:01:24,299
I think that's enough now.

459
01:01:24,983 --> 01:01:27,497
How come she ended up here?

460
01:01:28,783 --> 01:01:30,978
A great talent like her.

461
01:01:31,183 --> 01:01:32,741
That doesn't concern me.

462
01:01:35,583 --> 01:01:38,814
Don't you find it strange
to sit next to a murderer?

463
01:01:39,663 --> 01:01:42,177
As I said, it doesn't interest me.

464
01:01:45,824 --> 01:01:48,782
And that she decapitated
and cut up that guy?

465
01:01:49,024 --> 01:01:51,663
They found his head at the dump.

466
01:01:52,344 --> 01:01:54,175
Half eaten by rats.

467
01:01:55,984 --> 01:01:58,259
I'm only interested in music.

468
01:02:03,024 --> 01:02:04,662
<Why are you so upset?>

469
01:02:05,544 --> 01:02:09,014
You've never cared about her past.
Bye...

470
01:02:12,104 --> 01:02:14,493
What do you expect to find in her file?

471
01:02:18,944 --> 01:02:22,016
Mrs. Krüger,
you've achieved something great.

472
01:02:22,664 --> 01:02:25,417
<You got media attention...>
-If it's true...

473
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:30,653
... how can I keep on working with her?
<-If you're worried about your salary...>

474
01:02:30,984 --> 01:02:34,738
<... I'm sure we'll find a way...>
-I want to see her file!

475
01:03:22,864 --> 01:03:24,138
What?

476
01:03:54,064 --> 01:03:55,702
Where is she?

477
01:03:58,104 --> 01:04:00,254
No.
-What do you mean?

478
01:04:01,784 --> 01:04:03,854
I don't accept your apology.

479
01:04:06,304 --> 01:04:08,215
Is she sick?

480
01:04:08,944 --> 01:04:12,176
Let's go.
-Give me the key, I have to practice.

481
01:04:15,665 --> 01:04:17,576
Don't touch.

482
01:04:28,345 --> 01:04:29,698
Mrs. Krüger?

483
01:04:29,905 --> 01:04:31,577
What do you want?

484
01:04:31,785 --> 01:04:33,537
My name is von Loeben.

485
01:04:37,865 --> 01:04:41,460
You've seen the photo.
-I've seen Jenny's file.

486
01:04:45,025 --> 01:04:47,141
My daughter didn't do it.

487
01:04:48,025 --> 01:04:51,097
We're not going to talk
about Jenny's file.

488
01:04:56,385 --> 01:04:58,694
Then let's talk about your file.

489
01:05:01,705 --> 01:05:04,094
We're not going to talk at all.

490
01:05:10,945 --> 01:05:13,698
<''February 4, 1945.''>

491
01:05:19,265 --> 01:05:22,223
Don't ask what archive I found this in.

492
01:05:28,185 --> 01:05:31,018
I think you'd better leave,
Mr. von Loeben.

493
01:05:33,065 --> 01:05:35,943
Don't worry, nobody knows about it.

494
01:05:36,145 --> 01:05:38,101
Don't be afraid.

495
01:05:41,265 --> 01:05:43,495
Have you calmed down?

496
01:05:46,305 --> 01:05:48,261
Have you?
-Yes.

497
01:05:48,705 --> 01:05:49,979
Yes.

498
01:05:53,465 --> 01:05:55,456
You admire Mr. Furtwängler?

499
01:05:57,145 --> 01:05:59,056
He was my teacher.

500
01:06:01,745 --> 01:06:03,940
He supported you very much.

501
01:06:05,345 --> 01:06:07,540
He writes that you're the...

502
01:06:08,185 --> 01:06:10,540
... best German pianist
in your age group,

503
01:06:10,745 --> 01:06:15,136
ideologically grounded,
but mentally hypertensive.

504
01:06:15,345 --> 01:06:16,573
Yes.

505
01:06:20,545 --> 01:06:22,024
Communist?

506
01:06:22,225 --> 01:06:23,578
No.

507
01:06:24,825 --> 01:06:26,099
Related?

508
01:06:27,105 --> 01:06:29,096
What?
-Are you related to the convict?

509
01:06:29,705 --> 01:06:30,694
No.

510
01:06:30,905 --> 01:06:32,384
Friends?

511
01:06:32,945 --> 01:06:34,583
Yes, I'm...
-No.

512
01:06:37,106 --> 01:06:40,462
You're certainly not friends
with a parasite.

513
01:06:43,626 --> 01:06:44,820
No.

514
01:06:45,986 --> 01:06:47,499
Are you sure?

515
01:06:50,626 --> 01:06:52,218
Yes, I'm...

516
01:06:53,746 --> 01:06:56,214
I was just her piano teacher.

517
01:07:03,706 --> 01:07:06,095
<''In the morning of February 2,>

<with the convict.'''>

536
01:09:22,387 --> 01:09:24,776
Jenny never finished anything.

537
01:09:24,987 --> 01:09:26,818
She ended up on the street.

538
01:09:27,067 --> 01:09:32,061
There, or in some public restroom,
she met this cute little hustler.

539
01:09:33,187 --> 01:09:34,859
The cheapest kind.

540
01:09:36,467 --> 01:09:38,185
And then...

541
01:09:38,827 --> 01:09:41,295
... this boy killed his father.

542
01:09:45,227 --> 01:09:46,945
It's nice here.

543
01:09:47,627 --> 01:09:50,744
According to the files
your daughter did it.

544
01:09:50,987 --> 01:09:53,979
That's not true.
-Then why is she in prison?

545
01:09:54,187 --> 01:09:57,736
Because she was convicted,
not because she did it.

546
01:09:59,427 --> 01:10:02,703
She incriminated herself
to cover this loser.

547
01:10:04,707 --> 01:10:06,584
He dumped her and got free.

548
01:10:07,627 --> 01:10:09,902
She rejected any kind of help

549
01:10:10,187 --> 01:10:14,499
<i>because I urged her
to testify against the hustler.</i>

550
01:10:17,027 --> 01:10:19,780
He got her pregnant, did you know...
-Yes.

551
01:10:21,827 --> 01:10:25,217
Then she got angry
and pulled me into this.

552
01:10:26,467 --> 01:10:28,742
She mentioned our...

553
01:10:29,547 --> 01:10:31,902
... our relationship in court...

554
01:10:35,267 --> 01:10:36,905
What could I do?

555
01:10:37,147 --> 01:10:39,581
Admit that I slept with my daughter?

556
01:10:39,907 --> 01:10:42,341
My wife would have killed herself.

557
01:10:44,387 --> 01:10:46,264
What do you want from me?

558
01:10:48,187 --> 01:10:50,985
You canceled Jenny's piano lessons.

559
01:10:51,867 --> 01:10:53,459
She's innocent.

560
01:10:55,587 --> 01:10:57,817
She didn't do anything!

561
01:11:36,508 --> 01:11:39,659
What is this?
Why aren't you playing the piano?

562
01:11:57,948 --> 01:11:59,825
Hello, Mrs. Krüger.

563
01:12:03,148 --> 01:12:06,185
It's nice to have you back.
-What are you doing?

564
01:12:06,628 --> 01:12:09,062
We wanted to surprise you.

565
01:12:09,268 --> 01:12:10,747
Clara and I.

566
01:12:16,188 --> 01:12:19,385
So, Clara, can you do a curtsy now?

567
01:12:21,988 --> 01:12:24,218
Then I don't want your surprise.

568
01:12:24,908 --> 01:12:29,265
You denied Jenny access to the piano
for three days. Is that true?

569
01:12:30,188 --> 01:12:32,827
Well, I had to paint the music stand.

570
01:12:33,068 --> 01:12:35,059
Go tinker somewhere else.

571
01:12:42,748 --> 01:12:45,342
And you quit playing that negro music!

572
01:13:10,788 --> 01:13:12,380
Negro music, huh?

573
01:13:12,628 --> 01:13:15,984
I won't let you ruin your technique.

574
01:13:17,308 --> 01:13:19,264
The concert is in one week.

575
01:13:19,588 --> 01:13:22,421
We had an agreement.
-You lost us three days.

576
01:13:22,628 --> 01:13:25,825
I do what you say.
I play the pieces you pick.

577
01:13:26,068 --> 01:13:28,741
I work your fucking Schumann
till my ears hurt.

578
01:13:28,988 --> 01:13:32,947
So don't freak when I play
some good stuff. -It's noise.

579
01:13:33,188 --> 01:13:35,144
It's mine. It's me.

580
01:13:36,028 --> 01:13:37,381
Understand?

581
01:13:44,068 --> 01:13:46,343
If I hear that stuff again, it's over.

582
01:13:46,548 --> 01:13:49,267
You want me to do a fucking curtsy, too.

583
01:13:49,908 --> 01:13:52,980
You want your curtsy.
-No, I want you to win.

584
01:13:53,188 --> 01:13:56,545
All you want is
people doing a curtsy for you.

585
01:13:56,789 --> 01:13:59,667
But I won't do that, ever.
For no one.

586
01:14:04,709 --> 01:14:06,586
Want to go inside?

587
01:17:01,190 --> 01:17:04,466
Can't we still let her play the contest?
-After this?!

588
01:17:06,390 --> 01:17:07,789
I know...

589
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:11,941
But we have such good press.
-The girl does.

590
01:17:12,150 --> 01:17:14,061
''Melancholy behind bars.''

591
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:18,179
Considering she almost killed two guys,
that's good press!

592
01:17:18,470 --> 01:17:21,303
That's not the whole truth.
-It's the bottom line.

593
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:26,743
How would the press react if we ruined
her chances two days before the contest?

594
01:17:26,990 --> 01:17:31,939
She ruined it for herself, and I
don't give a shit what the papers write.

595
01:17:32,150 --> 01:17:34,459
What if they write about you?
-Me?

596
01:17:34,710 --> 01:17:37,747
''Petty prison officer
prevents world career.''

597
01:17:37,950 --> 01:17:39,269
There's worse:

598
01:17:39,510 --> 01:17:43,662
''Career-bent psychologist helps killer
and puts public at risk...''

599
01:17:43,870 --> 01:17:46,179
That headline is a bit too long.

600
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:52,186
So how about:
''Prison warden forced to resign.''

601
01:17:54,790 --> 01:17:56,428
Oh, really?
-You bet.

602
01:17:57,830 --> 01:17:59,900
You mean...
-Yes, I do.

603
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:08,820
Well, I think Mr. Kowalski has a point.

604
01:18:09,350 --> 01:18:13,821
I revoke the leave for your student.
Put her in strict confinement.

605
01:18:14,150 --> 01:18:17,267
We'll investigate.
-You're destroying her life.

606
01:18:18,870 --> 01:18:21,100
Jenny could try again next year.

607
01:18:21,310 --> 01:18:24,188
Then she'd have more time to prepare.

608
01:18:24,390 --> 01:18:26,699
Next year she'll be too old.

609
01:18:29,750 --> 01:18:31,388
And so will I.

610
01:18:33,390 --> 01:18:36,302
That's why I want to tell you something.

611
01:19:21,711 --> 01:19:23,349
How dare you!

612
01:19:41,991 --> 01:19:44,869
They said you're quitting.
Is that true?

613
01:19:49,751 --> 01:19:51,867
Why were you so mean to me?

614
01:19:53,751 --> 01:19:56,140
That hussy just uses our piano.

615
01:19:56,751 --> 01:19:59,868
I donated 500 euros for it,
you know that.

616
01:20:06,311 --> 01:20:08,506
Take as much as you need.

617
01:20:15,191 --> 01:20:18,183
I don't want you
to give it all up, honestly!

618
01:20:18,951 --> 01:20:20,782
And what about last night?

619
01:20:26,391 --> 01:20:29,224
You ask as if I weren't a good person.

620
01:20:30,551 --> 01:20:33,065
You're not all good, either.

621
01:20:33,631 --> 01:20:36,464
It was your idea, wasn't it?
-What if it was?

622
01:20:38,591 --> 01:20:41,230
Go tell warden Meyerbeer the truth.

623
01:20:41,431 --> 01:20:44,468
I have family, Mrs. Krüger,
I can't do that.

624
01:20:45,831 --> 01:20:48,743
<Oh, give me back my freedom.>

625
01:20:52,071 --> 01:20:54,631
<Oh, give me back my freedom.>

626
01:20:58,511 --> 01:21:01,025
<i>Oh, give...
-And wash away the shame...</i>

627
01:21:01,311 --> 01:21:03,347
<... with blood in battle.>

628
01:21:48,632 --> 01:21:50,702
They're not allowed in.

629
01:21:51,152 --> 01:21:52,983
Today is my last day.

630
01:21:53,992 --> 01:21:56,301
I just want to get my piano.

631
01:21:58,272 --> 01:22:00,183
Tell me, Mrs. Krüger...

632
01:22:00,392 --> 01:22:03,190
What do those guys have
that others don't?

633
01:22:08,072 --> 01:22:11,428
One's a murderer
and the other raped his niece.

634
01:22:18,992 --> 01:22:21,108
I'll miss you, Mrs. Krüger.

635
01:23:40,713 --> 01:23:42,192
Thank you.

636
01:23:43,593 --> 01:23:46,630
In about four hours
all hell will break loose.

637
01:23:48,313 --> 01:23:49,507
Goodbye.

638
01:24:01,193 --> 01:24:04,105
<So farewell, my dear little table.>

639
01:24:05,793 --> 01:24:07,226
Manon in <Manon>?

640
01:25:04,353 --> 01:25:06,025
Get a good price for it.

641
01:25:34,993 --> 01:25:38,303
You've got a lot ofjunk.
-Your dress is over there.

642
01:25:39,113 --> 01:25:42,901
Your shoes are polished.
-Who'll get all this when you're dead?

643
01:25:43,113 --> 01:25:45,832
Hurry up.
You still need to change.

644
01:25:57,993 --> 01:26:00,348
I'm going to have some water.

645
01:26:14,274 --> 01:26:16,390
Hello, this is Mrs. Krüger...

646
01:26:16,594 --> 01:26:18,983
I'm calling about Jenny von Loeben.

647
01:26:19,754 --> 01:26:21,824
Yes, we're coming after all.

648
01:26:22,194 --> 01:26:23,786
I'm glad, too.

649
01:26:24,314 --> 01:26:26,703
Are you in charge of the contest?

650
01:26:27,234 --> 01:26:28,826
Please fetch him.

651
01:26:29,034 --> 01:26:31,707
I thought you didn't drink alcohol.

652
01:26:31,914 --> 01:26:36,510
Jenny, put some clothes on!
-I thought you didn't drink, general.

653
01:26:36,714 --> 01:26:37,988
Please.

654
01:26:40,034 --> 01:26:41,467
He was here?
-Not now...

655
01:26:41,714 --> 01:26:45,423
No, we'll talk about it now.
-Jenny, we need to hurry...

656
01:26:45,754 --> 01:26:49,110
Hang up and tell me
what my fucking father was doing here,

657
01:26:49,314 --> 01:26:51,589
or I'll have a fit right now.

658
01:27:00,674 --> 01:27:03,142
It's true, he was here.
-Fucking shit!

659
01:27:06,794 --> 01:27:09,149
Stop it, please!
-Oh, shit!

660
01:27:12,754 --> 01:27:15,666
He bought you.
He planned the whole thing!

661
01:27:15,994 --> 01:27:17,473
No, he didn't.

662
01:27:17,954 --> 01:27:19,945
He checks out the prison,

663
01:27:20,394 --> 01:27:24,273
follows the pathetic teacher
into her pathetic apartment

664
01:27:24,474 --> 01:27:26,465
and opens his fat wallet.

665
01:27:26,674 --> 01:27:28,983
You've got it wrong.
-You lied to me.

666
01:27:29,354 --> 01:27:31,584
No.
-Yes, the whole time.

667
01:27:34,834 --> 01:27:36,472
And the dress?

668
01:27:37,914 --> 01:27:41,065
Did he pick it?
Did he buy the goddamn dress?

669
01:27:42,874 --> 01:27:44,751
And the hand ointments?

670
01:27:44,954 --> 01:27:47,184
Did he choose the music, too?

671
01:27:47,514 --> 01:27:49,744
Did my father pick Schumann?

672
01:27:56,674 --> 01:28:01,145
He probably got me out of jail.
Since you weren't able to, granny.

673
01:28:01,394 --> 01:28:04,067
Believe me, I never took any money.

674
01:28:04,874 --> 01:28:06,990
I don't care about money.

675
01:28:08,034 --> 01:28:09,865
I only love music.

676
01:28:10,114 --> 01:28:12,389
Nobody only loves music.

677
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:15,707
You get off on having a hot student.

678
01:28:15,954 --> 01:28:19,867
You're vain and eaten up by ambition.
You don't care about me.

679
01:28:20,074 --> 01:28:21,587
But Jenny...

680
01:28:22,714 --> 01:28:25,103
I told you from the start

681
01:28:25,514 --> 01:28:27,904
that I don't care about you.

682
01:28:34,635 --> 01:28:36,466
Where are you going?

683
01:28:37,795 --> 01:28:39,467
Where are you going?

684
01:28:40,955 --> 01:28:42,104
Away.

685
01:28:42,315 --> 01:28:44,431
We could still make it.

686
01:29:01,675 --> 01:29:03,233
Open the door.

687
01:29:03,515 --> 01:29:05,631
Look at this.
-What's it about?

688
01:29:06,395 --> 01:29:09,034
Who I am.
-I know you're a stupid whore.

689
01:29:09,275 --> 01:29:11,391
No, I'm a stupid lesbian.
-See?

690
01:29:28,675 --> 01:29:30,313
What did you say?

691
01:29:31,715 --> 01:29:34,388
That's your way of talking, isn't it?

692
01:29:40,595 --> 01:29:42,506
I once loved a woman.

693
01:29:44,115 --> 01:29:45,514
She's dead.

694
01:29:47,475 --> 01:29:49,113
I still love her.

695
01:29:51,475 --> 01:29:53,067
It's all in there.

696
01:29:56,235 --> 01:29:58,590
Eat it. Come on.
-Jenny...

697
01:29:58,795 --> 01:30:00,990
You don't believe me?
-Eat it!

698
01:30:02,115 --> 01:30:03,992
Eat it, goddamn it!

699
01:30:04,795 --> 01:30:07,832
Jenny, don't...
-If you follow me, I'll hit you!

700
01:30:11,595 --> 01:30:13,313
Jenny, wait!

701
01:30:13,515 --> 01:30:15,665
You little rat!

702
01:30:48,635 --> 01:30:50,273
You hit me.

703
01:30:56,676 --> 01:30:58,394
I warned you.

704
01:31:06,316 --> 01:31:08,113
Did anyone see us?

705
01:31:08,796 --> 01:31:10,354
What was she like?

706
01:31:11,316 --> 01:31:13,546
Different.
-It says 'communist' here.

707
01:31:13,756 --> 01:31:15,428
That's what I mean.

708
01:31:17,956 --> 01:31:19,594
No one saw us.

709
01:31:25,916 --> 01:31:27,907
Hannah knew what hatred is.

710
01:31:31,196 --> 01:31:33,027
And she knew what love is.

711
01:31:37,396 --> 01:31:40,627
Most people are happy
to be kissed good-night.

712
01:31:43,516 --> 01:31:46,667
She took the photo three days
before her arrest.

713
01:31:47,276 --> 01:31:50,905
A comrade of hers was tortured
and gave away her name.

714
01:31:53,596 --> 01:31:56,588
Hannah was going to be decapitated.

715
01:31:57,716 --> 01:31:59,115
But...

716
01:32:00,836 --> 01:32:04,351
... on the day of her execution
a bomb destroyed the scaffold.

717
01:32:10,556 --> 01:32:12,706
So they thought of something else.

718
01:33:15,756 --> 01:33:17,667
Am I supposed to cry now?

719
01:33:20,997 --> 01:33:23,386
Do you think it's easy?

720
01:33:24,357 --> 01:33:27,235
You think today was an easy day for me?

721
01:33:28,837 --> 01:33:31,590
Why do you think
I've stayed here for 60 years?

722
01:33:31,837 --> 01:33:34,351
Because of a dead body?
Great!

723
01:33:34,597 --> 01:33:39,068
A lesbian who likes corpses.
You're a perverted freak, madam.

724
01:33:41,917 --> 01:33:43,430
How dare you!

725
01:33:45,477 --> 01:33:47,672
How dare you talk like that?

726
01:33:49,877 --> 01:33:52,550
I've worked very hard for this day.

727
01:33:52,797 --> 01:33:56,585
I've overlooked your respectless manners
and your fits.

728
01:33:57,037 --> 01:33:58,755
I got you out of prison.

729
01:34:00,077 --> 01:34:02,386
I told you about the only person...

730
01:34:02,637 --> 01:34:05,549
... I care about,
and you walk all over me!

731
01:34:05,757 --> 01:34:10,194
I didn't mean to... -You don't know
about the ease of annihilation!

732
01:34:10,397 --> 01:34:13,753
How dare you
flush your talent down the toilet?

733
01:34:13,997 --> 01:34:15,715
Listen...
-Shut up!

734
01:34:23,197 --> 01:34:25,506
They just murdered this woman.

735
01:34:27,637 --> 01:34:31,073
Even though, unlike you,
she hadn't done anything!

736
01:34:34,477 --> 01:34:36,627
Maybe she had a talent, too.

737
01:34:40,157 --> 01:34:44,753
Perhaps she would have done anything...
to live out that talent.

738
01:34:45,677 --> 01:34:47,668
What else is there in life?

739
01:34:48,517 --> 01:34:51,395
What's our purpose, Jenny von Loeben?

740
01:34:52,597 --> 01:34:54,792
To break someone's skull?

741
01:34:55,997 --> 01:34:58,875
Or to waste away
in a prison cell for decades?

742
01:34:59,397 --> 01:35:02,195
Or to reduce the world to rubble?

743
01:35:03,757 --> 01:35:06,191
We all have a job to do, damn it!

744
01:35:08,277 --> 01:35:11,110
I don't know what my job here was.

745
01:35:13,157 --> 01:35:15,512
Maybe just to persevere.

746
01:35:16,677 --> 01:35:18,508
But yourjob...

747
01:35:19,277 --> 01:35:22,394
... is as clear as a bright day.

748
01:35:23,437 --> 01:35:25,632
It is yourjob...

749
01:35:25,877 --> 01:35:27,993
... and excuse my language...

750
01:35:28,557 --> 01:35:32,789
... to get your lazy ass out of my chair
and get moving.

751
01:35:34,237 --> 01:35:37,468
Yourjob starts in two hours.

752
01:35:38,277 --> 01:35:40,108
In the <Deutsche Oper>.

753
01:35:40,357 --> 01:35:43,474
That, Jenny... is yourjob!

754
01:36:48,238 --> 01:36:49,591
Good evening.

755
01:36:49,798 --> 01:36:52,392
It's already started.
-I'm a finalist.

756
01:36:55,238 --> 01:36:57,149
At the youth competition?

757
01:36:57,718 --> 01:36:59,356
Jenny von Loeben!

758
01:37:00,078 --> 01:37:02,831
I called two hours ago.
We were delayed.

759
01:37:04,838 --> 01:37:07,398
I need to see her ID.
-Please!

760
01:37:08,038 --> 01:37:10,950
Or something similar.
-I'll be right back.

761
01:37:53,718 --> 01:37:56,471
This is indeed Ms. von Loeben.
-And you are?

762
01:37:57,558 --> 01:37:59,116
Her father.

763
01:37:59,478 --> 01:38:02,436
Her name is on my family swim pass.

764
01:38:21,839 --> 01:38:24,637
Schumann... is a good choice.

765
01:38:35,399 --> 01:38:37,469
I hope you win, Jenny.

766
01:38:38,039 --> 01:38:40,155
I hope you die, Daddy.

767
01:39:00,639 --> 01:39:04,712
He knows nothing about Schumann.
It was my choice, not his.

768
01:39:10,279 --> 01:39:12,429
You'll play it beautifully.

769
01:39:18,959 --> 01:39:20,677
Two minutes to go.

770
01:39:34,799 --> 01:39:36,391
Good luck.

771
01:39:43,599 --> 01:39:45,476
Beautiful hands.

772
01:39:48,759 --> 01:39:50,033
Thanks.

773
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:47,715
Ladies and gentlemen...

774
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:54,472
... please welcome
Jenny von Loeben.

775
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:06,758
We are going to hear
Schumann's <A Minor Concert>.

776
01:41:29,960 --> 01:41:31,757
I did it, I got her out.

777
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:34,713
Oh my, Mrs. Krüger,
now we're in deep shit.

778
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:38,876
Give her those few minutes.

779
01:41:40,280 --> 01:41:41,679
Please.

780
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:46,791
Please.
-What do you mean by a few minutes?

781
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:50,279
Four.

782
01:46:58,178 --> 01:47:03,000
