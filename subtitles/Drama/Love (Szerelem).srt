1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,359
It says a couple that kisses on
graduation day...


2
00:00:03,359 --> 00:00:05,576
will stay together forever!


3
00:00:05,576 --> 00:00:06,957
Wait! Look at that!


4
00:00:09,271 --> 00:00:10,399
<i>A kiss?</i>


5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,304
My first kiss?


6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,022
<i>I enjoyed this year the most
out of the past three years.</i>


7
00:00:17,256 --> 00:00:22,259
I suffered this year the most
out of the past eighteen years.


8
00:00:22,853 --> 00:00:26,147
You and I are not so good
at studying.


9
00:00:26,453 --> 00:00:30,069
<i>But we should find something
that we are good at.</i>


10
00:00:30,069 --> 00:00:33,480
<i>If I find something and become big...</i>


11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,679
will you love me?


12
00:00:35,832 --> 00:00:37,762
<i>She finally...</i>


13
00:00:37,987 --> 00:00:42,650
realized who cares about her the most.


14
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:46,941
Kin-chan, sorry to keep you waiting!


15
00:00:47,093 --> 00:00:51,408
Irie and Kotoko are destined
to be together.


16
00:00:51,408 --> 00:00:54,101
- Don't be silly.
- You, cold-blooded man.


17
00:00:54,101 --> 00:00:56,666
But you love this cold-blooded man,
don't you?


18
00:01:15,817 --> 00:01:22,037
<i>Irie-kun and I kissed, didn't we?</i>


19
00:01:24,957 --> 00:01:26,382
Come with me.


20
00:01:33,183 --> 00:01:34,188
What is it?


21
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:41,118
I'm... going to quit loving you.


22
00:01:42,042 --> 00:01:43,147
I see.


23
00:01:44,592 --> 00:01:47,656
So you'll forget about me?


24
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,974
Then let's see if you can
forget about me.


25
00:02:24,452 --> 00:02:25,602
Sorry.


26
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,242
I've been feeling kind of shy
since that day.


27
00:02:32,917 --> 00:02:34,991
I just couldn't be honest.


28
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,082
It was a dream.


29
00:03:23,873 --> 00:03:29,701
<i>I've been waking up to these
kind of dreams since that day.</i>


30
00:03:33,668 --> 00:03:37,521
<i>But... not even a second kiss.</i>


31
00:03:38,663 --> 00:03:43,154
The relationship between Irie-kun and I
hasn't made any progress.


32
00:03:45,388 --> 00:03:48,374
And the short spring break
is now over.


33
00:03:59,516 --> 00:04:06,620
Starting today,
Irie-kun and I are college students.


34
00:04:12,398 --> 00:04:16,672
<i>Tonan University
The day of the Entrance Ceremony</i>


35
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,336
Hey.


36
00:04:20,446 --> 00:04:21,351
Yes.


37
00:04:21,351 --> 00:04:23,323
How long are you going to follow me?


38
00:04:24,007 --> 00:04:26,572
Are you going to the science
and engineering department?


39
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,155
That's right.
I'm in the literature department.


40
00:04:30,495 --> 00:04:31,606
Bye bye.


41
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:59,852
And so you came to the science and
engineering department to spy on Irie?


42
00:04:59,987 --> 00:05:03,567
You haven't made any progress
since high school, Kotoko.


43
00:05:03,567 --> 00:05:06,069
The quality of Kotoko never changes.


44
00:05:07,277 --> 00:05:10,320
But I see only men in the science
and engineering department.


45
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,340
It looks like you don't have to
worry about girls around Irie.


46
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,930
You are safe, Kotoko.


47
00:05:18,202 --> 00:05:20,341
Kotoko, look at that girl.


48
00:05:32,896 --> 00:05:35,194
Wh-who is that beautiful girl?


49
00:05:35,194 --> 00:05:40,416
Wow, I can see sparkles around her
on this campus full of men.


50
00:05:47,322 --> 00:05:48,520
Irie-kun.


51
00:05:51,194 --> 00:05:52,800
Naoki Irie!


52
00:05:54,462 --> 00:05:56,652
Have you chosen your elective course?


53
00:05:56,784 --> 00:05:58,402
No, I haven't.


54
00:05:59,536 --> 00:06:01,511
What should I choose?


55
00:06:01,511 --> 00:06:02,759
Whoa!


56
00:06:02,993 --> 00:06:04,717
What? Jinko and Satomi!


57
00:06:10,313 --> 00:06:11,980
Do you need something?


58
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:18,235
I was wondering what kind of desks are used
in the science and engineering department.


59
00:06:19,301 --> 00:06:20,611
She's hopeless.


60
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,496
Is she your girlfriend?


61
00:06:27,806 --> 00:06:29,005
No way.


62
00:06:44,269 --> 00:06:45,664
<i>'No way?'</i>


63
00:06:47,203 --> 00:06:48,893
<i>We kissed...</i>


64
00:06:49,228 --> 00:06:51,098
<i>but still 'No way?'</i>


65
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:58,209
<i>What's going to happen to
my college life?</i>

You kissed?

00:09:06,894 --> 00:09:08,668
You are too loud.


70
00:09:08,668 --> 00:09:11,539
How can I not be loud after
hearing this?

<i> Episode 6
A rival emerges!? Love with a lot of trouble.</i>


72
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:15,314
That Irie kissed you?


73
00:09:15,314 --> 00:09:18,921
But from what I just saw,
it doesn't seem like it at all.


74
00:09:20,846 --> 00:09:22,060
I know.


75
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,987
Serves you right.


76
00:09:36,099 --> 00:09:40,538
I can't understand what Irie-kun
is thinking at all.


77
00:09:41,892 --> 00:09:44,127
Stop being a wimp.


78
00:09:44,127 --> 00:09:47,823
You gave your precious first kiss to Irie.


79
00:09:47,823 --> 00:09:50,194
She's right.
You have to be tough.


80
00:09:50,194 --> 00:09:51,972
We are freshmen in college.


81
00:09:51,972 --> 00:09:53,603
Plus it's spring time.


82
00:09:54,067 --> 00:09:55,903
The season to meet new people.


83
00:10:08,264 --> 00:10:13,241
If you just sit around and do nothing,
the beautiful girl is going to get Irie.


84
00:10:23,974 --> 00:10:25,717
<i>Aihara</i>


85
00:10:25,717 --> 00:10:27,677
- Welcome.
- Ai-chan!


86
00:10:27,677 --> 00:10:30,372
Thank you for inviting us.


87
00:10:30,372 --> 00:10:33,858
We need to congratulate Naoki
and Kotoko for their first day of college.


88
00:10:33,858 --> 00:10:35,016
Please have a seat.


89
00:10:35,016 --> 00:10:37,229
Thank you. Let's sit down.


90
00:10:37,656 --> 00:10:39,024
I'm so excited.


91
00:10:43,064 --> 00:10:45,376
This restaurant has very good taste.


92
00:10:45,376 --> 00:10:46,495
Right?


93
00:10:46,802 --> 00:10:50,747
Ai-chan said the highest quality of
Japanese paper is used for this paper.


94
00:10:50,747 --> 00:10:52,212
Oh really?


95
00:10:52,212 --> 00:10:53,853
You can't make it dirty.


96
00:10:54,369 --> 00:10:57,437
And these chopsticks are the
highest quality too.


97
00:10:57,437 --> 00:10:59,047
So you can't make them dirty either.


98
00:10:59,047 --> 00:11:00,594
We can't eat then.


99
00:11:00,594 --> 00:11:02,512
I will eat it with my stomach.


100
00:11:03,008 --> 00:11:04,627
Welcome.


101
00:11:07,147 --> 00:11:08,215
Kin-chan?


102
00:11:10,432 --> 00:11:13,790
Oh, you look different.


103
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:16,366
I didn't recognize you at all.


104
00:11:16,366 --> 00:11:18,558
You look better this way.


105
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:21,376
Thank you, Madam.


106
00:11:21,738 --> 00:11:24,045
But why are you working at Aihara?


107
00:11:24,045 --> 00:11:29,568
I started working as an apprentice here
to become a professional chef.


108
00:11:29,742 --> 00:11:33,518
I see. You are good at cooking.


109
00:11:33,936 --> 00:11:36,959
Compared to a real chef's food,
my food is not good enough.


110
00:11:37,222 --> 00:11:40,069
But I will work hard and become a
better chef than your father.


111
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:42,333
And I will be the best chef in Japan.


112
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,469
I won't lose against you.


113
00:11:46,301 --> 00:11:49,463
I will become a professional chef
and make a lot of money...


114
00:11:49,463 --> 00:11:52,050
and I will come and get you.
Be prepared for that!


115
00:11:54,793 --> 00:11:56,967
Kinnosuke, how long are you
staying there?


116
00:11:56,967 --> 00:11:58,836
I'm sorry. I will be quick!


117
00:11:58,836 --> 00:12:00,681
Kotoko, please do this for me?


118
00:12:26,515 --> 00:12:30,023
These are so uneven.
I can't give them to customers.


119
00:12:30,023 --> 00:12:32,369
- I'm sorry.
- Let me show you.


120
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:35,883
- Fold each one carefully.
- Yes.


121
00:12:40,261 --> 00:12:41,367
Yes.


122
00:12:42,076 --> 00:12:43,614
Thank you very much.


123
00:12:50,225 --> 00:12:51,315
Kin-chan.


124
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,833
You found what you want to do.


125
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,032
I'm impressed. Good luck.


126
00:12:58,032 --> 00:13:01,301
Yeah. Good luck with your
studying at school!


127
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,646
Jinko and Satomi too.


128
00:13:44,141 --> 00:13:46,231
Cut it by pushing the blade
of the knife.


129
00:13:46,231 --> 00:13:47,238
Yes.


130
00:13:51,157 --> 00:13:52,808
This is too thick.


131
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,336
You can take a bath now.


132
00:14:18,391 --> 00:14:19,648
Um, Irie-kun.


133
00:14:21,926 --> 00:14:23,086
What?


134
00:14:24,057 --> 00:14:29,412
Who was that girl from the science
and engineer department?


135
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,807
Oh, Yuko Matsumoto?


136
00:14:33,048 --> 00:14:35,576
You already know her full-name?


137
00:14:35,943 --> 00:14:38,495
I won't forget if I hear it once.


138
00:14:41,264 --> 00:14:46,866
Is it possible that Matsumoto-san likes you?


139
00:14:48,176 --> 00:14:50,827
Huh? Are you jealous?


140
00:14:52,315 --> 00:14:53,858
Oh no...


141
00:14:55,088 --> 00:14:59,413
Come to think of it,
she certainly is beautiful.


142
00:15:00,131 --> 00:15:02,184
She has a great body.


143
00:15:03,825 --> 00:15:05,751
And she is smart.


144
00:15:05,843 --> 00:15:09,121
She said she was once in the fifth place
on the national exam.


145
00:15:10,099 --> 00:15:12,573
Why did a person like that
attend our school?


146
00:15:12,573 --> 00:15:13,954
Who knows?


147
00:15:14,211 --> 00:15:16,587
Maybe she has another purpose.


148
00:15:21,014 --> 00:15:25,386
What's this? I thought you were
going to forget about me.


149
00:15:28,682 --> 00:15:31,155
Oh, that's right.


150
00:15:32,343 --> 00:15:34,508
We kissed, didn't we?


151
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,338
Now you can't forget about me?


152
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:43,208
<i>Could this be...</i>


153
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:46,327
<i>the second kiss?</i>


154
00:15:58,545 --> 00:16:01,537
<i>I've been teased.</i>


155
00:16:01,981 --> 00:16:07,850
<i>Irie-kun doesn't care that we kissed.</i>


156
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,565
Not fair.


157
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:18,100
So that girl's name is Yuko Matsumoto?


158
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:22,474
She is beautiful and smart.
She is like a female version of Irie.


159
00:16:22,474 --> 00:16:25,766
Well, I guess I can say
Irie and her are a good match.


160
00:16:25,766 --> 00:16:27,741
Please don't say such an
ominous thing.


161
00:16:27,741 --> 00:16:29,876
But you have to be realistic.


162
00:16:29,876 --> 00:16:32,701
Obviously she is going for Irie.


163
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:35,580
You are in big trouble.


164
00:16:41,707 --> 00:16:43,448
Eat some food and feel better.


165
00:16:43,448 --> 00:16:44,839
What should I eat?


166
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:58,110
Kotoko.


167
00:16:58,484 --> 00:16:59,484
Kotoko?


168
00:17:00,077 --> 00:17:01,534
You haven't ordered yet?


169
00:17:01,534 --> 00:17:03,413
I was spaced out. Sorry.


170
00:17:03,413 --> 00:17:06,149
- We will be sitting down, okay?
- Okay.


171
00:17:08,307 --> 00:17:15,065
Well, Lunch A is hamburg steak.
Lunch B is deep fried shrimp.


172
00:17:15,065 --> 00:17:17,989
You can't think without
saying things out loud?


173
00:17:18,381 --> 00:17:20,004
Can I get one Lunch A?


174
00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:22,211
I would like to...


175
00:17:22,211 --> 00:17:24,298
They don't have Lunch F.


176
00:17:24,913 --> 00:17:26,815
I'm getting Lunch A too.


177
00:17:27,889 --> 00:17:29,369
Two Lunch A's.


178
00:17:37,282 --> 00:17:38,782
Why is there such a difference?


179
00:17:39,594 --> 00:17:41,248
Excuse me, Sir.


180
00:17:41,248 --> 00:17:42,934
Do you have any complaints?


181
00:17:43,537 --> 00:17:46,710
Are you complaining about the
fairness of my servings?


182
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:49,081
You've got some nerve.


183
00:17:49,952 --> 00:17:51,077
Kin-chan?


184
00:17:54,015 --> 00:17:55,207
What are you doing?


185
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,060
You said you found what you
wanted to do.


186
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,812
You're not working at
my father's restaurant?


187
00:17:58,812 --> 00:18:02,272
I am working at his restaurant at night.


188
00:18:02,272 --> 00:18:04,412
And for lunch, I'm
working at this cafeteria.


189
00:18:04,412 --> 00:18:06,385
I will learn how to
cook inexpensive food and...


190
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,949
food from the high-end restaurant as well.


191
00:18:08,949 --> 00:18:10,193
Isn't it amazing?


192
00:18:10,349 --> 00:18:15,071
Also, I have to protect Kotoko
from that evil guy.


193
00:18:15,992 --> 00:18:17,635
What do you say, Mr. Genius?


194
00:18:17,969 --> 00:18:20,261
Are you so surprised
that you can't say a word?


195
00:18:20,261 --> 00:18:22,816
I'm very impressed...


196
00:18:23,502 --> 00:18:26,857
that a man can change
his life according to one girl.


197
00:18:27,703 --> 00:18:30,580
I can't do that.


198
00:18:31,138 --> 00:18:32,518
What did you say?


199
00:18:32,801 --> 00:18:35,616
I'll leave you two alone now.
Please enjoy.


200
00:18:39,711 --> 00:18:43,274
I bet you got scared of
my love power.


201
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:45,582
Right, Kotoko?


202
00:18:53,212 --> 00:18:56,287
<i>But in a way, Kin-chan is right.</i>


203
00:18:57,083 --> 00:19:01,474
A man gets attracted to
a woman who stays close.


204
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:22,621
Kotoko, you should learn
from Kin-chan.


205
00:19:23,084 --> 00:19:26,729
Yeah. Although you two
are in the same college...


206
00:19:26,729 --> 00:19:30,191
he's in science and engineering
and you're in the literature department.


207
00:19:30,191 --> 00:19:32,328
You have different campuses.


208
00:19:32,749 --> 00:19:35,381
It's not going to be the same
as it was in high school.


209
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:39,677
Yuko Matsumoto from the same department
has a big advantage.


210
00:19:39,677 --> 00:19:42,993
On top of that, she is beautiful
and has a perfect body.


211
00:19:43,465 --> 00:19:44,776
Oh no...


212
00:19:46,662 --> 00:19:49,036
There you are, Irie.


213
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,612
- Sudo-san, good to see you.
- Good to see you.


214
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:53,896
Who is that old man?


215
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,780
Don't know.


216
00:20:00,687 --> 00:20:02,141
Is he a senior?


217
00:20:02,263 --> 00:20:04,312
Or a professor?


218
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,494
You know why I'm here, don't you?


219
00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:10,404
If you would like...
No, if you would really like...


220
00:20:10,404 --> 00:20:12,389
Join our club.


221
00:20:12,892 --> 00:20:15,123
I have no intention of joining
any clubs.


222
00:20:15,123 --> 00:20:16,734
Please don't say that.


223
00:20:16,734 --> 00:20:19,773
We've known each other since
elementary school.


224
00:20:19,972 --> 00:20:21,557
I will be waiting for you after school.


225
00:20:21,557 --> 00:20:22,862
Okay?


226
00:20:25,562 --> 00:20:26,934
Adios!


227
00:20:30,169 --> 00:20:33,300
Kotoko, your chance has come.


228
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:36,326
You should join the same club as Irie.


229
00:20:36,326 --> 00:20:40,341
You can still be with him even though
you're not in the same department.


230
00:20:40,341 --> 00:20:43,080
That's right. This is your chance to
drive Yuko Matsumoto away!


231
00:20:43,186 --> 00:20:44,278
That's right!


232
00:20:45,666 --> 00:20:46,703
I will do that.


233
00:20:48,546 --> 00:20:50,039
I'll take your fried shrimp.


234
00:20:53,203 --> 00:20:55,013
So good! So good!


235
00:20:55,013 --> 00:20:56,595
So good!


236
00:21:00,055 --> 00:21:02,616
Irie-kun, are you going to join a club?


237
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,477
What club are you going to join?


238
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,853
I won't tell you.


239
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,075
Why not?


240
00:21:10,814 --> 00:21:13,532
Because I feel like you're going to
join the same one.


241
00:21:17,046 --> 00:21:18,072
That is...


242
00:21:21,459 --> 00:21:23,351
He knows what we're thinking.


243
00:21:23,351 --> 00:21:25,110
He surely is a genius.


244
00:21:25,942 --> 00:21:27,457
I'm not giving up.


245
00:21:27,655 --> 00:21:28,709
Let's do it.


246
00:21:31,968 --> 00:21:33,379
Let's do it.


247
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:59,341
<i>That bearded old man said he would
be waiting for him after school.</i>


248
00:21:59,934 --> 00:22:05,188
<i>That means if I follow him, I'll be able to
find out what club he's going to join.</i>


249
00:22:36,735 --> 00:22:41,142
<i>Anyway, I didn't know there were
so many different kinds of clubs.</i>


250
00:22:42,571 --> 00:22:46,587
<i>I wonder which club Irie-kun
is joining.</i>


251
00:22:58,813 --> 00:23:00,093
That room!


252
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,297
May I join this club?


253
00:23:22,909 --> 00:23:25,910
The Anime Study Group?


254
00:23:27,774 --> 00:23:30,976
Um, is Irie-kun here?


255
00:23:31,585 --> 00:23:32,793
Irie?


256
00:23:34,152 --> 00:23:36,367
Who is that?


257
00:23:36,422 --> 00:23:39,903
Is that the man who came in
for a second and left?


258
00:23:56,496 --> 00:23:57,963
Please excuse me.


259
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:57,402
You're late.
I said we should go together.


260
00:24:57,736 --> 00:25:00,586
You decided that on your own.


261
00:25:00,767 --> 00:25:05,444
But it doesn't matter since we are
going to join the same club.


262
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,423
The same club?


263
00:25:09,826 --> 00:25:11,016
Let's go inside.


264
00:25:13,364 --> 00:25:14,493
Fine.


265
00:25:16,646 --> 00:25:19,047
Excuse me, I would like to
join this club too.


266
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:23,488
Well, who are you?


267
00:25:23,488 --> 00:25:24,696
Who is your referral?


268
00:25:25,624 --> 00:25:29,737
I don't have a referral, but...


269
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:32,939
I really want to join this club...


270
00:25:32,939 --> 00:25:34,637
<i>[Tonan University Tennis Club]</i>


271
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:37,135
Join this tennis club.


272
00:25:37,309 --> 00:25:42,330
I thought if I entered Tonan University,
I would definitely join this tennis club.


273
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:43,608
Nice to meet you all.


274
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:50,227
It's all right, Captain.
Anyone with enthusiasm is welcome.


275
00:25:50,311 --> 00:25:51,643
What is your name?


276
00:25:51,643 --> 00:25:53,412
I'm Kotoko Aihara.


277
00:25:53,412 --> 00:25:55,279
Kotoko-chan! Come in, come in!


278
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,647
I'm Sudo. I'm in charge of
new members.


279
00:25:57,647 --> 00:26:00,963
We're just about to start a
welcome party for our new members.


280
00:26:01,609 --> 00:26:02,841
You stand on this side.


281
00:26:03,544 --> 00:26:05,788
Let me start explaining.


282
00:26:05,788 --> 00:26:08,726
If you have any questions,
please ask Sudo.


283
00:26:08,726 --> 00:26:10,892
I will tell you anything but my
cell phone number.


284
00:26:18,241 --> 00:26:19,368
How about this?


285
00:26:19,368 --> 00:26:22,281
Wow, is this for me?


286
00:26:22,522 --> 00:26:25,314
I'm glad that you're going
to play tennis.


287
00:26:25,314 --> 00:26:28,944
I was pretty good when
I was young.


288
00:26:28,944 --> 00:26:30,078
You were?


289
00:26:30,078 --> 00:26:34,770
Yes, I taught Naoki when he
first started playing tennis.


290
00:26:35,137 --> 00:26:39,307
Naoki, don't you think
Kotoko-chan's tennis outfit is cute?


291
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:40,324
What do you think?


292
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,409
I don't think it's a good idea to start
with picking your outfit.


293
00:26:53,426 --> 00:26:55,637
You're doing great!


294
00:26:56,787 --> 00:27:00,661
You and Naoki joined the same club.


295
00:27:00,661 --> 00:27:03,377
That means you two are in love.


296
00:27:04,045 --> 00:27:06,566
It's nothing like that.


297
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:09,045
Irie-kun is popular.


298
00:27:09,243 --> 00:27:10,278
What?


299
00:27:15,738 --> 00:27:16,840
Mrs. Irie.


300
00:27:18,114 --> 00:27:23,677
Do you think Irie-kun likes girls
who are beautiful and smart?


301
00:27:24,108 --> 00:27:28,337
Don't tell me that there is a girl
like that around Naoki?


302
00:27:30,705 --> 00:27:34,499
Wow. I didn't know he was
that popular.


303
00:27:34,499 --> 00:27:36,902
He is so blunt.


304
00:27:37,892 --> 00:27:39,515
But don't worry, Kotoko-chan.


305
00:27:39,515 --> 00:27:42,825
For now, go to the science and
engineering department all the time and...


306
00:27:42,825 --> 00:27:44,502
approach him.
That's the only way.


307
00:27:44,725 --> 00:27:47,009
No matter what kind of girl she is...


308
00:27:47,009 --> 00:27:50,182
you are the best girl for Naoki.


309
00:27:51,798 --> 00:27:52,970
Well...


310
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:57,687
I know because I've been watching you
while we've been living together.


311
00:27:57,795 --> 00:28:00,228
Okay? I'm rooting for you!


312
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:04,982
Here. Hold this racket.


313
00:28:05,133 --> 00:28:06,605
Right. And make a pose.


314
00:28:06,605 --> 00:28:08,383
You look so good.


315
00:28:09,044 --> 00:28:12,459
Swing it! Receive!


316
00:28:26,568 --> 00:28:30,276
Good. Now I am going to
get my love.


317
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:34,811
Great, Kotoko!


318
00:28:36,403 --> 00:28:37,657
What are you doing?


319
00:28:45,293 --> 00:28:46,509
Serve.


320
00:28:48,947 --> 00:28:50,093
Good, Kotoko.


321
00:28:50,093 --> 00:28:51,240
Nice.


322
00:29:09,338 --> 00:29:11,511
All right, new members.


323
00:29:11,511 --> 00:29:14,939
Today is the first day of practice,
so we are going to have a little test.


324
00:29:15,186 --> 00:29:18,208
We will just take a look
at your skill.


325
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,346
Please try to do your best.


326
00:29:19,346 --> 00:29:20,352
Yes.


327
00:29:21,479 --> 00:29:22,562
<i>What?</i>


328
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:25,026
<i>A test? No one told me that!</i>


329
00:29:25,233 --> 00:29:29,792
Your opponent is Sudo from Junior year,
who is in charge of new members.


330
00:29:29,792 --> 00:29:32,803
I'm Sudo. Pleased to meet you.


331
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,354
Pleased to meet you.


332
00:29:36,833 --> 00:29:38,925
I'm glad that it's Sudo.


333
00:29:39,981 --> 00:29:42,274
You don't know anything.


334
00:29:43,736 --> 00:29:45,005
What are you talking about?


335
00:29:58,203 --> 00:30:01,530
Sudo seems to have changed.


336
00:30:01,595 --> 00:30:04,559
Then... Wada, you go first.


337
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:08,062
What? I'm going first?


338
00:30:08,442 --> 00:30:11,713
You thought it would be
in alphabetical order?


339
00:30:13,239 --> 00:30:15,993
I'm a man who likes to do
things unexpectedly.


340
00:30:16,192 --> 00:30:18,918
Wada, come to the court.


341
00:30:35,053 --> 00:30:38,092
What are you standing there for?


342
00:30:39,619 --> 00:30:41,626
He's called 'Sudo the Demon.'


343
00:30:42,794 --> 00:30:44,242
Next.


344
00:30:44,607 --> 00:30:46,146
Yano.
Come.


345
00:30:46,321 --> 00:30:47,575
Yes.


346
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:03,529
When Sudo-san holds a racket,
his personality changes.


347
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:06,270
He's been known for that since
he was in elementary school.


348
00:31:06,933 --> 00:31:08,765
Normally he is gentle.


349
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:14,702
Miyamoto! Come!


350
00:31:15,883 --> 00:31:16,914
Yes.


351
00:31:46,428 --> 00:31:48,575
Matsumoto-san is really good.


352
00:31:49,295 --> 00:31:53,399
She made it to the last four in the women's
singles division when she was in high school.


353
00:31:55,890 --> 00:32:01,750
<i>She was smart enough to go to
any university she wanted.</i>


354
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:06,440
Tonan University has an
excellent tennis club.


355
00:32:07,534 --> 00:32:10,122
How do you know all that?


356
00:32:10,616 --> 00:32:13,498
She asked me for advice when
she was choosing her school.


357
00:32:14,063 --> 00:32:17,779
I met her at the national tournament
in the first year of high school.


358
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:29,421
<i>Irie-kun didn't know me in the
first year of high school.</i>


359
00:32:30,321 --> 00:32:33,208
<i>I was just looking at him from afar.</i>


360
00:32:33,928 --> 00:32:39,990
<i>That means Matsumoto-san's relationship
with Irie-kun is longer than mine.</i>


361
00:32:42,857 --> 00:32:44,800
I feel like I'm going to lose.


362
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,406
I'm impressed, Matsumoto.
Good job.


363
00:32:50,444 --> 00:32:51,934
Thank you very much.


364
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:53,249
Next.


365
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,139
Naoki Irie.


366
00:32:58,418 --> 00:32:59,547
Come.


367
00:33:00,425 --> 00:33:01,481
Yes.


368
00:33:03,768 --> 00:33:05,420
Finally the day has come.


369
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,399
Indeed.


370
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,250
Please go easy on me.


371
00:33:09,591 --> 00:33:12,143
I would never go easy on you.


372
00:33:45,451 --> 00:33:49,188
Irie-kun is amazing.


373
00:33:49,763 --> 00:33:51,121
That's it.


374
00:33:51,477 --> 00:33:53,481
Irie, get off the court.


375
00:33:54,343 --> 00:33:56,300
Wait, Irie. One more time.


376
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,210
Sudo, today is only a test.


377
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,862
No, I want to play again.


378
00:34:01,862 --> 00:34:05,368
Naoki Irie is unbelievable.
Exactly what the rumor said.


379
00:34:05,368 --> 00:34:07,154
But look at Sudo's face!


380
00:34:08,277 --> 00:34:10,645
He is furious.


381
00:34:10,801 --> 00:34:12,696
I feel bad for the next person.


382
00:34:17,128 --> 00:34:18,522
Next.


383
00:34:18,887 --> 00:34:22,139
Kotoko Aihara! Come!


384
00:34:24,193 --> 00:34:25,349
Yes.


385
00:34:32,903 --> 00:34:34,789
Don't walk like a snail!


386
00:34:35,211 --> 00:34:36,252
Yes.


387
00:34:40,006 --> 00:34:41,131
Excuse me!


388
00:34:42,534 --> 00:34:45,201
I've never played tennis before.


389
00:34:45,201 --> 00:34:46,766
Shut up!


390
00:34:47,121 --> 00:34:48,159
Here I come!


391
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:49,674
Yes.


392
00:35:03,175 --> 00:35:04,613
What's wrong with her?


393
00:35:04,613 --> 00:35:06,554
Hey, don't run away!


394
00:35:06,554 --> 00:35:07,977
Hold your racket!


395
00:35:07,977 --> 00:35:09,724
Open your eyes!


396
00:35:09,724 --> 00:35:11,735
- Let's go!
- Yes.


397
00:35:35,471 --> 00:35:38,328
Oh no, Aihara has fainted.


398
00:35:57,059 --> 00:35:58,810
- Here.
- Ouch, ouch, ouch.


399
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:00,834
Are you okay, Kotoko-chan?


400
00:36:01,804 --> 00:36:04,692
Same as usual, Kotoko is so uncool.


401
00:36:04,692 --> 00:36:06,171
Yuki.


402
00:36:07,144 --> 00:36:10,409
You shouldn't go to practice tomorrow.


403
00:36:10,409 --> 00:36:15,203
New members are not allowed
to miss practice in our club.


404
00:36:15,495 --> 00:36:17,511
It'll be okay.
I'll get used to it soon.


405
00:36:17,852 --> 00:36:20,153
You shouldn't push yourself
too much.


406
00:36:20,153 --> 00:36:21,202
Yes.


407
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:23,066
Do you have any other injuries?


408
00:36:23,066 --> 00:36:25,792
I think I'm okay now.


409
00:36:25,792 --> 00:36:27,757
I just have sore muscles.


410
00:36:36,182 --> 00:36:38,248
<i>Aihara
In Preparation</i>


411
00:36:51,147 --> 00:36:53,410
Boss, what should I do with these?


412
00:36:53,516 --> 00:36:56,299
Wash them and peel the skin off.


413
00:36:56,315 --> 00:36:57,432
Yes.


414
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,300
Hey, Kinnosuke.


415
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:02,490
Yes?


416
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:06,540
So you are working at the
university during the day?


417
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,635
Yes, I am.


418
00:37:08,515 --> 00:37:12,210
How is Kotoko at the school?


419
00:37:13,054 --> 00:37:17,101
She is pretty much the same
as how she was in high school.


420
00:37:17,658 --> 00:37:20,061
She can't be the same.


421
00:37:20,213 --> 00:37:22,209
She is getting older and...


422
00:37:22,756 --> 00:37:23,990
Um, like...


423
00:37:26,977 --> 00:37:29,928
a boyfriend or something...


424
00:37:30,555 --> 00:37:35,479
I am making sure that not a
single man can approach her.


425
00:37:35,533 --> 00:37:38,637
Then how about Naoki?


426
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,439
Boss, don't worry.


427
00:37:44,092 --> 00:37:47,519
I will protect her from that evil man.


428
00:37:47,853 --> 00:37:51,508
And since their classes
are in different buildings...


429
00:37:51,719 --> 00:37:57,441
I feel like their distance has gotten
larger than it was in high school.


430
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:01,153
After all, I see justice being done.


431
00:38:05,363 --> 00:38:07,750
Hey, Kinnosuke.


432
00:38:08,988 --> 00:38:10,149
Yes?


433
00:38:10,387 --> 00:38:13,375
Can you pass on my message?


434
00:38:18,893 --> 00:38:19,878
Ouch.


435
00:38:19,878 --> 00:38:22,498
Kotoko, is your face okay?


436
00:38:22,748 --> 00:38:24,140
It hurts!


437
00:38:24,485 --> 00:38:27,913
I hear Tonan tennis club is
very intense.


438
00:38:27,976 --> 00:38:30,953
Because it's so hard,
many new members quit.


439
00:38:30,953 --> 00:38:33,117
Every year only a few would
stay by the end.


440
00:38:33,117 --> 00:38:36,703
Really? Are you sure you
can continue?


441
00:38:38,375 --> 00:38:41,583
I'll do anything to be close to Irie-kun.


442
00:38:42,765 --> 00:38:44,104
Just quit.


443
00:38:44,449 --> 00:38:45,965
- Here.
- Kin-chan.


444
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:49,315
<i> Kotoko
Love</i>


445
00:38:49,397 --> 00:38:51,617
Only for Kotoko? It's not fair


446
00:38:51,617 --> 00:38:54,030
Be quiet, or I will rub my butt.


447
00:38:56,504 --> 00:38:58,137
It's a special cake from me.


448
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:01,621
Hey, Kotoko.


449
00:39:02,526 --> 00:39:04,124
You should quit playing tennis.


450
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:08,439
There is no need for you to injure
your pretty face and keep playing.


451
00:39:09,502 --> 00:39:11,907
I want to do my best since
I already started.


452
00:39:12,291 --> 00:39:16,452
My father taught me that
I should never give up halfway.


453
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:19,488
Kotoko.


454
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:23,223
You are so dedicated.


455
00:39:24,713 --> 00:39:27,689
By the way, I have a
message from your father.


456
00:39:28,102 --> 00:39:29,966
He wants you to come to
Aihara tonight.


457
00:39:30,542 --> 00:39:32,762
- Why?
- I don't know why.


458
00:39:32,826 --> 00:39:34,896
He says he wants to have
a talk with you.


459
00:39:37,485 --> 00:39:38,532
Have some.


460
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,065
Let's eat!


461
00:39:41,423 --> 00:39:43,406
You are both eating too much.


462
00:39:44,744 --> 00:39:46,728
- Oops!
- What do you mean by 'oops?'


463
00:39:47,033 --> 00:39:48,910
- And you ate the 'love' part.
- So tasty!


464
00:39:49,126 --> 00:39:51,524
You ate the 'love' part.


465
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:55,312
What are you doing?
Hurry up!


466
00:39:56,582 --> 00:39:58,920
Bring your hips all the way down.


467
00:39:59,672 --> 00:40:02,006
You are not putting enough
spirit into this.


468
00:40:02,421 --> 00:40:05,312
If you are like that, we don't
need you in the tennis club.


469
00:40:05,676 --> 00:40:07,004
Just quit already!


470
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:09,413
You want to quit?


471
00:40:09,413 --> 00:40:10,541
No, I don't.


472
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:11,722
Right?


473
00:40:11,726 --> 00:40:13,844
The river is running.


474
00:40:14,084 --> 00:40:16,102
The forest is alive.


475
00:40:16,204 --> 00:40:17,464
We are all...


476
00:40:17,622 --> 00:40:19,856
- Alive.
- That's right.


477
00:40:20,177 --> 00:40:21,329
Take a break.


478
00:40:21,329 --> 00:40:22,470
- The break is over.
- Seriously?


479
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:25,996
You don't deserve a break.


480
00:40:26,505 --> 00:40:28,467
Next, do one hundred sit-ups.


481
00:40:28,696 --> 00:40:30,571
- Yes.
- I couldn't hear you.


482
00:40:30,571 --> 00:40:31,739
Yes!


483
00:40:35,284 --> 00:40:37,373
<i>Is this supposed to be
a tennis club?</i>


484
00:40:37,714 --> 00:40:40,064
<i>All we do is muscle training.</i>


485
00:40:40,535 --> 00:40:45,756
<i>And both Irie-kun and
Yuko Matsumoto aren't here.</i>


486
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:49,260
<i>What in the world is going on?</i>


487
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:54,751
Ouch.


488
00:40:55,057 --> 00:40:56,838
I'm sorry, Kotoko.


489
00:40:56,838 --> 00:40:58,746
Could you please throw it to me?


490
00:41:00,898 --> 00:41:03,276
Wait. Hey!


491
00:41:04,567 --> 00:41:09,752
You're a new member too, so
why are you practicing in the court?


492
00:41:10,046 --> 00:41:11,459
What about the muscle training?


493
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:13,686
Oh, didn't you know?


494
00:41:14,087 --> 00:41:16,384
Performance is the most important
thing in Tonan tennis club.


495
00:41:16,384 --> 00:41:22,125
So if you passed yesterday's test, even a
new member is allowed to play in the court.


496
00:41:22,547 --> 00:41:24,042
Is that true?


497
00:41:24,042 --> 00:41:26,284
In that case, Irie-kun is...


498
00:41:26,594 --> 00:41:28,805
Irie-kun has even more privileges.


499
00:41:28,805 --> 00:41:31,166
He joined the club with two conditions,
he can play only when he feels like...


500
00:41:31,166 --> 00:41:32,959
and at the official games.


501
00:41:33,155 --> 00:41:37,032
No way. Does that mean he's not
coming to the practices?


502
00:41:38,092 --> 00:41:42,332
<i>Then why did I join the tennis club?</i>


503
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:47,969
Oh! I heard that you are
living in his house.


504
00:41:48,604 --> 00:41:51,506
But you don't know anything
about him.


505
00:41:52,398 --> 00:41:55,531
I guess that means your
relationship with him is only that level.


506
00:42:01,504 --> 00:42:02,829
Aihara.


507
00:42:02,885 --> 00:42:04,528
Are you goofing off again?


508
00:42:04,818 --> 00:42:07,641
Run one hundred laps around
the track as punishment!


509
00:42:08,548 --> 00:42:10,330
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for coming.


510
00:42:23,352 --> 00:42:25,807
Kotoko, you're here.


511
00:42:26,419 --> 00:42:29,321
Hey Kinnosuke, when did I say
you could leave your position?


512
00:42:29,321 --> 00:42:30,767
There are many dirty dishes.


513
00:42:30,767 --> 00:42:31,872
I'm sorry, Bro.


514
00:42:32,363 --> 00:42:35,022
I will see you at school!


515
00:42:37,787 --> 00:42:39,036
What's wrong, Kotoko?


516
00:42:39,919 --> 00:42:41,980
I have sore muscles.


517
00:42:42,072 --> 00:42:43,295
What?


518
00:42:43,295 --> 00:42:45,640
Anyway what did you want
to tell me?


519
00:42:45,742 --> 00:42:46,842
Well...


520
00:42:47,429 --> 00:42:49,418
We will use the private room
for a little while.


521
00:42:49,418 --> 00:42:50,502
Yes.


522
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:54,333
Are you all right?


523
00:43:02,883 --> 00:43:04,919
It looks so delicious!


524
00:43:05,858 --> 00:43:07,335
Thank you for the food.


525
00:43:15,729 --> 00:43:18,555
It tastes even better after exercising.


526
00:43:20,902 --> 00:43:23,522
You were never good at playing
ball sports.


527
00:43:24,961 --> 00:43:27,601
I know you are not
interested in playing tennis.


528
00:43:29,203 --> 00:43:32,301
Are you doing it for Naoki?


529
00:43:33,487 --> 00:43:35,984
Why are you asking me this
all of a sudden?


530
00:43:37,192 --> 00:43:38,455
Listen, Kotoko.


531
00:43:40,426 --> 00:43:43,444
It's been almost a year since
we moved in with the Irie family.


532
00:43:45,285 --> 00:43:47,722
I've been thinking a lot about this.


533
00:43:48,408 --> 00:43:53,988
I don't think we should be depending on
their generosity for too long.


534
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:01,237
I know Iri-chan and Mrs. Irie
are treating you well.


535
00:44:01,449 --> 00:44:05,455
To be honest with you,
I did hope that you and Naoki would...


536
00:44:05,455 --> 00:44:11,007
I thought that you two would
be together in the future.


537
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:12,330
Father.


538
00:44:13,351 --> 00:44:18,164
But I've watched you two
for a long time...


539
00:44:18,726 --> 00:44:23,188
and Naoki seems to have
no interest in you.


540
00:44:25,218 --> 00:44:27,239
I don't think this plan would work.


541
00:44:33,202 --> 00:44:38,697
Let's go back to living on our own.
Just the two of us.


542
00:44:39,107 --> 00:44:40,614
What do you say, Kotoko?


543
00:44:57,408 --> 00:45:00,459
<i>Of course I want to respect
your feelings too.</i>


544
00:45:00,977 --> 00:45:03,711
<i>But I found a nice place nearby.</i>


545
00:45:05,095 --> 00:45:09,006
<i>I want you to consider my feelings too.</i>


546
00:45:11,785 --> 00:45:17,549
I... hate to see you getting hurt.


547
00:45:20,671 --> 00:45:27,485
<i>But if I move out of Irie's house now...</i>


548
00:45:29,956 --> 00:45:35,088
<i>There will be nothing left to
connect Irie and I.</i>


549
00:45:43,577 --> 00:45:45,355
What are you gazing at?


550
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,022
Irie-kun.


551
00:45:48,816 --> 00:45:51,590
Are you going home now?
Where did you go?


552
00:45:51,982 --> 00:45:54,135
I don't need to tell you
where I went.


553
00:45:55,925 --> 00:45:57,573
How about you?


554
00:45:57,653 --> 00:45:58,963
It's late.


555
00:45:59,869 --> 00:46:02,673
I went to my father's restaurant.


556
00:46:05,148 --> 00:46:06,305
Your father's?


557
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:07,327
Yeah.


558
00:46:13,293 --> 00:46:17,117
Did you go there to see that guy?


559
00:46:17,472 --> 00:46:18,725
That guy?


560
00:46:19,775 --> 00:46:22,167
Never mind.


561
00:46:23,623 --> 00:46:29,456
My father said he found
a nice place to live.


562
00:46:32,109 --> 00:46:33,240
What?


563
00:46:36,337 --> 00:46:38,867
Our new home.


564
00:46:40,433 --> 00:46:43,011
He said he hasn't signed a lease yet.


565
00:46:45,433 --> 00:46:51,137
It's been almost a year since
we started living with your family.


566
00:46:51,528 --> 00:46:55,547
That's why he thought about this.


567
00:46:55,883 --> 00:46:57,433
That's why...


568
00:46:59,656 --> 00:47:02,075
So you are moving out?


569
00:47:10,857 --> 00:47:12,421
If that happens...


570
00:47:14,662 --> 00:47:16,108
will you miss us?


571
00:47:30,489 --> 00:47:32,077
Irie-kun?


572
00:47:34,945 --> 00:47:38,291
Finally, I can go back to living
the way I used to.


573
00:47:48,984 --> 00:47:50,494
<i>I don't understand.</i>


574
00:47:52,574 --> 00:47:54,484
<i>I don't understand...</i>


575
00:47:55,076 --> 00:47:57,884
<i>how you feel, Irie-kun.</i>


576
00:47:59,715 --> 00:48:03,477
<i>What should I do?</i>

00:49:40,245 --> 00:49:42,462
I gave up on Irie.


595
00:49:42,462 --> 00:49:43,549
No way!


596
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:45,274
We will play doubles.


597
00:49:45,274 --> 00:49:47,684
Your partner is Kotoko Aihara.


598
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:50,297
- No.
- Don't ever get in my way.


599
00:49:50,383 --> 00:49:53,720
Irie's feelings might change if
you succeed by working together.


600
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:58,483
Are you trying so hard to play tennis
because you want to stay with Irie?


601
00:49:58,483 --> 00:50:00,662
We will definitely win.
Got it?


602
00:50:00,662 --> 00:50:03,458
How can you stay calm after giving
someone you love...


603
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:05,132
so much trouble?


604
00:50:07,582 --> 00:50:09,772
Everything will end.
