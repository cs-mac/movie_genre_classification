I need to get up.

183
00:17:30,295 --> 00:17:32,411
I need to make a lot of money.

184
00:17:34,216 --> 00:17:36,216
Climb the family with intensity.

185
00:17:39,215 --> 00:17:40,807
Make sure she goes to college.

186
00:17:42,531 --> 00:17:44,487
Knowing that we're even.

187
00:17:47,931 --> 00:17:49,808
Hey Mo.

188
00:17:50,171 --> 00:17:52,844
Hey Mo, brother.
Are you awake?

189
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,482

We will go on a date together.

192
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:25,160
They say there are great beaches in Miami

193
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:28,125
You can swim with dolphins and other.

194
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,361
You and Leila can go shopping.

195

Anything you want.

197
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:05,478
I found another drunk sleeping in my workplace

198
00:19:12,445 --> 00:19:16,961
- Honey you're going to the library today?
- Mom looking for what you want to know in wikipedia

199
00:19:17,005 --> 00:19:20,122

00:19:21,205 --> 00:19:23,321
- Call
Rashid - Already did.

201
00:19:23,525 --> 00:19:27,996
In Mensuration into heat when we slept on the roof.

202
00:19:28,044 --> 00:19:30,763
If you're in England but here nobody
dad sleeps on the roof.

203
00:19:31,364 --> 00:19:33,036
By building roofs is thus a tip
end.

204
00:19:33,244 --> 00:19:35,155
Why would sleep on the roof?

205
00:19:36,924 --> 00:19:38,596
Is the best way to sleep.

206
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:39,993
- Where is that?
- In Mensuration.

207
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:47,720
- Oh, Rashid!
- Boys.

208
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:12,148

209
00:20:12,399 --> 00:20:14,867
- Have a nice day?
- Ok

210
00:21:47,668 --> 00:21:49,260
I guess that's what we have to do

211
00:21:52,068 --> 00:21:53,820

212
00:21:59,468 --> 00:22:02,221

219
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:36,290
How much can you do on the street?

220
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:40,696

do 325 a day if you want.

221
00:22:40,747 --> 00:22:43,580

00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:44,972

282
00:33:08,766 --> 00:33:10,597
Were a gangster!

283
00:33:11,846 --> 00:33:15,475
My brothers, at home.

284
00:33:15,966 --> 00:33:18,321
In Paris.

285
00:33:18,526 --> 00:33:20,437

286
00:33:20,486 --> 00:33:22,204
I liked life friend.

287
00:33:22,406 --> 00:33:24,203

289
00:33:28,766 --> 00:33:30,802
Shit.

290
00:33:31,086 --> 00:33:35,159
That's why you left and came here?
- If, among other reasons.

291
00:33:46,201 --> 00:33:48,476
Not your fault.

292
00:33:49,601 --> 00:33:51,512
If it was.

293
00:33:51,961 --> 00:33:53,952
Ando out there thinking that I'm untouchable.

294
00:33:54,761 --> 00:33:56,752
But those fools who did go to pay.

295
00:34:00,041 --> 00:34:03,317
The fort is one that can be controlled
when upset.

296
00:34:03,521 --> 00:34:07,355
My father used to say.

297
00:34:10,441 --> 00:34:13,717
Yeah? But the Qur'an says
that everything must be stated.

298
00:34:14,281 --> 00:34:17,637
So if it was written before
the difference?

299
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:22,113
If you have to spend...
Equal to happen, right?

300
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,556
Is depending on where you put the frame...

301
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,797
Shit!

302
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,789
That's sick friend.

303
00:35:13,315 --> 00:35:16,034

307
00:35:26,075 --> 00:35:27,554
Yeah right,

308
00:35:28,755 --> 00:35:31,588
Yes .. and more useful

309
00:35:34,995 --> 00:35:37,793

310
00:35:38,075 --> 00:35:40,111

00:35:40,394 --> 00:35:43,147
- The Prophet
- Is the Prophet Muhammad?

312
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,786
If I think.

313
00:35:45,830 --> 00:35:50,267
Why are you reading a book?

314
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:54,927

316
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:00,024
We will not do anything.

317
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:02,823
You can be out of this.
We...

318
00:36:35,429 --> 00:36:36,909

I have to get one ASAP.

324
00:37:49,299 --> 00:37:52,655
You know you're going to do.

325
00:37:52,699 --> 00:37:54,655
No, I think I'll do something.

326
00:37:57,419 --> 00:38:02,857
That friend? Impossible friend.

327
00:38:04,499 --> 00:38:08,856
- What? What do you idiot?
- No, I want a large neck.

328
00:38:09,739 --> 00:38:12,572
When you turn 18.

329
00:39:14,052 --> 00:39:15,883
Did you?
What do you mean you do not prime?

330
00:39:15,932 --> 00:39:17,684
Do not you?

331
00:39:17,852 --> 00:39:20,366
I knew it! Give it to me.

332
00:39:20,532 --> 00:39:22,409
Shit! @

333
00:39:47,248 --> 00:39:50,160
Ok will be for the next time, bro.

334
00:39:53,367 --> 00:39:56,484
Right.

335
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:57,796
There will be a next time.

336
00:39:59,927 --> 00:40:01,679
That was it.

337
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:05,204
He finished the damn game.

338
00:40:06,767 --> 00:40:11,245
Once you're dead you can not go.

339
00:40:13,007 --> 00:40:15,760
But if we do nothing then
we lose and they win.

340
00:40:20,647 --> 00:40:22,438
Probably lose the same.

341
00:41:46,177 --> 00:41:48,272
Not fill the references section.

342
00:41:51,317 --> 00:41:54,548
Not have to be a former employer
can be a teacher

343
00:41:54,757 --> 00:41:56,748
Or any other professional
I can say something good about you.

344
00:42:15,916 --> 00:42:17,713
Head.

345
00:42:53,831 --> 00:42:57,983
Lenny... I want out.

346
00:42:59,991 --> 00:43:01,868
Get away?

347
00:43:02,591 --> 00:43:05,549
How do you get out?
Can go friend.

348
00:43:06,941 --> 00:43:08,900
're Hurt now.

349
00:43:08,871 --> 00:43:10,871
I understand.

350
00:43:10,891 --> 00:43:12,791
Low profile can be a while.

351
00:43:15,751 --> 00:43:17,469
No. ..

352
00:43:20,551 --> 00:43:23,384
Primo want out.

353
00:43:23,911 --> 00:43:25,663
Seriously.

354
00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:32,463
I can not do this anymore.

355
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:38,625
You have to understand, all the chiefs
has helpers.

356
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:41,588
Motherfucker you heard?

357
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:43,018
Not be ready ok?

358
00:43:44,426 --> 00:43:45,745
We can not.

359
00:43:46,266 --> 00:43:48,257
Do not do stupid things

360
00:43:50,876 --> 00:43:52,617
're just a horrible cunt.

361
00:43:54,145 --> 00:43:55,976
You future.

362
00:43:56,985 --> 00:43:58,384
If...

363
00:43:58,425 --> 00:43:59,983
I'm thinking ahead, cousin.

364
00:44:03,305 --> 00:44:05,494
Seat.

365
00:44:10,764 --> 00:44:13,661
Have much money to win

366
00:44:17,344 --> 00:44:21,744
I'm saying that you should know what to do with this.

367
00:44:23,984 --> 00:44:28,933
- No, that's bacon right?
- Is not bacon flavor bacon, is different.

368
00:44:28,984 --> 00:44:31,657
- Is still bacon.
- There are not just chemicals.

369
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:35,813
Equal not need that shit.

370
00:44:36,184 --> 00:44:39,184
- Do they have spirit within?
- Let's not be stupid.

371
00:44:39,194 --> 00:44:42,816
I'm serious!
Has ethanol or something.

372
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:47,376
Well if you want to keep talking this bad
maybe I'll keep eating them.

373
00:44:50,059 --> 00:44:52,254
- What is it?
- Nothing.

374
00:44:52,419 --> 00:44:55,570
- Are we friends with you?
- Nothing's wrong.

375
00:44:55,739 --> 00:44:59,039
- Rashid is acting like an idiot.
- Is because it is busy.

376
00:44:59,049 --> 00:45:03,294
No, it's something else, is something
I had not seen before.

377
00:45:03,339 --> 00:45:05,057
From the funeral.

378
00:45:05,759 --> 00:45:08,171
You know, I know all of Rashid
friends but do not know it.

379
00:45:09,019 --> 00:45:11,328
- Maybe it's a cop.
- No friend handles everything.

380
00:45:11,539 --> 00:45:15,134
- Maybe it's a drug dealer.
- No, I think not.

381
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:17,409
- Have things classy.

382
00:45:17,979 --> 00:45:19,970
Now I've been reading books about him prophet
that.

383
00:46:00,574 --> 00:46:03,372
I want to do something different.

384
00:46:04,734 --> 00:46:09,489
I have lived all my life here
and had never been here.

385
00:46:11,094 --> 00:46:13,483
's Crazy.

386
00:46:18,333 --> 00:46:21,006
I want to get a job.

387
00:46:30,933 --> 00:46:32,969
You work for me.

388
00:46:33,133 --> 00:46:37,331
If... if that is good.

389
00:46:37,573 --> 00:46:42,408
- What do I know about photography?
- No, seriously... I have some work in door.

390
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:45,448
I would give more time for the exhibition.

391
00:46:47,109 --> 00:46:49,766
If you want.

392
00:47:01,048 --> 00:47:04,199
Fuck me, brother.
Are you training for the Olympics?

393
00:47:04,248 --> 00:47:06,887
Fuck.

394
00:47:07,048 --> 00:47:08,447
Just kidding.

395
00:47:08,768 --> 00:47:11,328
Why are you so happy?

396
00:47:13,768 --> 00:47:16,077
Do not stop!

397
00:47:17,638 --> 00:47:20,482
- Rashid, I have not finished!
- Okay, okay.

398
00:47:22,608 --> 00:47:24,166
Let  stronger!

399
00:47:24,368 --> 00:47:26,928
Let stronger!
As if you really wanted to.

400
00:47:36,768 --> 00:47:39,362
Shit... Dad will kill us.

401
00:47:44,123 --> 00:47:46,762
They say it's bad luck.

402
00:47:48,443 --> 00:47:51,037
If... good.

403
00:47:51,523 --> 00:47:53,275
Just do not have much luck here.

404
00:47:58,843 --> 00:48:02,392
Rashid...
It's all my fault?

405
00:48:04,723 --> 00:48:06,202
No brother.

406
00:48:07,973 --> 00:48:10,231
It's my fault.

407
00:48:13,283 --> 00:48:16,195
Sometimes I forget what it was.

408
00:48:17,163 --> 00:48:20,280
For five minutes I do not remember
and I feel bad.

409
00:48:22,642 --> 00:48:25,002
Do not want to forget.

410
00:48:27,602 --> 00:48:29,719
No one will forget, ok?

411
00:48:52,598 --> 00:48:56,273
- Rashid Wanna hear my rap?
- No brother.

412
00:48:56,518 --> 00:48:58,076
I have to do something to pay the bills.

413
00:48:58,318 --> 00:49:00,036
Only half brother.

414
00:50:06,571 --> 00:50:08,880
Not slept 18 full days.

415
00:50:09,531 --> 00:50:12,125
The revolution brought the real Egyptians.

416
00:50:12,291 --> 00:50:14,486
The Egyptians had from Nazareth.

417
00:50:16,571 --> 00:50:18,084
Like my mom's food.

418
00:50:20,251 --> 00:50:26,042
I saw on youtube, they want a new government
to have a new order.

419
00:50:26,251 --> 00:50:29,751
To be able to control everything,
because Obama is the boss.

420
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,161
- No Dad, for you.
- Eat!

421
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:36,126
The revolution made want to return?

422
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:41,244
Yes, I wanted to go back but not easy.
I have jobs, bills, school.

423
00:50:41,410 --> 00:50:43,210
What can an old man like me?

424
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:45,528
We have to get more involved in the democratic process.

425
00:50:46,106 --> 00:50:49,326
- Because most end up here?
- Not done here, I was born here.

426
00:50:49,326 --> 00:50:51,123
Do not talk about things you do not understand right?

427
00:50:53,566 --> 00:50:56,603
- Thank you for giving a job Rashid
- Oh not good.

428
00:50:56,926 --> 00:51:00,396
I have a lot of work and has
been great to have him with me.

429
00:51:01,006 --> 00:51:03,006
So what?
Are you the new gangster or something?

430
00:51:03,012 --> 00:51:06,596
Shut?  I said before?!
- I just think that this policy is bullshit.

431
00:51:06,806 --> 00:51:08,717
If it's so good because
left the war?

432
00:51:08,766 --> 00:51:10,643
All politicians are liars!

433
00:51:15,645 --> 00:51:17,715
-
Sorry - No, I'm sorry.

434
00:51:23,105 --> 00:51:25,221
- You all right there?
- Service Is there anything there?

435
00:51:25,785 --> 00:51:27,662
You know that we can earn a lot with coca.

436
00:51:29,785 --> 00:51:34,654
- Is gaining like easy.
- Look who came.

437
00:51:34,705 --> 00:51:37,458
- Where have you been?
- For there, in class.

438
00:51:37,505 --> 00:51:39,097
- If fine.
- How is Rashid?

439
00:51:39,145 --> 00:51:41,500
That crazy bastard has been very strange.

440
00:51:41,705 --> 00:51:43,696
- With a new job.
- Work?

441
00:51:44,021 --> 00:51:46,171
Working for such Sayd.

442
00:51:46,221 --> 00:51:47,210
So now you have a job right?

443
00:51:48,381 --> 00:51:51,373
Let anyway...
You say you'll do.

444
00:51:51,421 --> 00:51:53,776
- What do you mean?
- How much is in your pocket now?

445
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:00,377
- 2.50 in simple
- What is that? Money for chicken.

446
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:06,058
As I see you're not happy.

447
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:08,296
- Right?
- If

448
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:10,490
- Do you have to eat right?

449
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:14,892
Then we have a couple of deliveries
do and pay between 50 and 250 pounds.

450
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:19,291
Not even have to tell Rashid.

451
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,577
You can do it,
know, man to man.

452
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:24,733
- Yeah, man to man
- Is that a good idea?

453
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,971
- Who pays here bitch?

454
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:29,617
What the hell are you laughing?

455
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:32,010
Fuck, drug addict.

456
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:35,334
- Shut your mouth.
- To hell with Rashid, just not my dad.

457
00:52:35,379 --> 00:52:39,139
- You can do what you want.
- I heard that cousin.

458
00:52:39,139 --> 00:52:41,016
- Hey bobo pass me a line.

459
00:52:41,819 --> 00:52:43,332
- Here you cousin.

460
00:52:44,535 --> 00:52:51,175
- This is for you. Every day you come,
pick the food, waiting calls,

461
00:52:51,175 --> 00:52:54,053
pass by the shops and you get 50 pounds
day.

462
00:52:54,255 --> 00:52:56,689
Listen you have to have your business well.

463
00:52:56,895 --> 00:53:00,365
Can not go out so no more.
You have to keep a low profile, you know?

464
00:53:00,415 --> 00:53:01,973
If... clear.

465
00:53:02,695 --> 00:53:04,890
Is for you today.

466
00:53:06,735 --> 00:53:08,407
- Yes?
- If great.

467
00:53:08,615 --> 00:53:11,015
- Welcome to DMG.
- Health.

468
00:53:13,095 --> 00:53:15,450
Is a brother shot.

469
00:53:17,014 --> 00:53:18,925
YES!

470
00:53:55,090 --> 00:53:57,365
Where did you get that friend?

471
00:53:58,030 --> 00:54:00,727
What, you think I can not do it?

472
00:54:00,929 --> 00:54:02,601
I can do everything.

473
00:54:05,049 --> 00:54:07,119
The real gangsters are gangsters say no.

474
00:54:07,249 --> 00:54:08,602
I let pass that.

475
00:54:08,649 --> 00:54:10,367
Good friend, whatever.

476
00:54:11,489 --> 00:54:14,129
- Here.
- No thanks.

477
00:54:14,129 --> 00:54:15,448
That's disgusting.

478
00:54:15,649 --> 00:54:17,446
Do not drink?

479
00:54:17,689 --> 00:54:19,281
No.

480
00:54:22,629 --> 00:54:24,629
- Do not smoke?
- No. ..

481
00:54:24,649 --> 00:54:28,161
Really?
Not even a little in your life?

482
00:54:28,329 --> 00:54:30,126
Never.

483
00:54:30,369 --> 00:54:31,722
Really?

484
00:54:32,049 --> 00:54:34,643
Write a review! It's nothing bad.

485
00:54:34,769 --> 00:54:38,399
Nothing bad... I just...
The majority I've seen...

486
00:54:38,409 --> 00:54:41,523
Well, I'm not like them.

487
00:54:41,568 --> 00:54:44,321
You hear that?

488
00:54:53,644 --> 00:54:55,714

Look from afar.

505
00:56:27,897 --> 00:56:31,094

Hey now, do not! No! No!

00:56:38,737 --> 00:56:40,375
Do not touch my camera.

510
00:56:41,497 --> 00:56:45,888
- If, as a super famous.
- I'll be when you stop to take photos.

511
00:56:46,093 --> 00:56:48,653
Give it to me, give it to me!

512
00:56:55,472 --> 00:56:58,305

515
00:57:03,912 --> 00:57:05,425
- Are you?
- It just was not me.

516
00:57:08,232 --> 00:57:09,506
Not just me.

517
00:57:10,272 --> 00:57:12,308
Damn.

518
00:58:11,827 --> 00:58:13,943
Are you little idiot?

519
00:58:18,466 --> 00:58:20,696
- Where have you been?
- Like you care.

520
00:58:26,906 --> 00:58:28,297
Hey, let me do it.

521
00:58:31,946 --> 00:58:34,983
I was worried brother.

522
00:58:36,706 --> 00:58:38,344
And we need to talk.

523
00:58:39,866 --> 00:58:41,697
Because I've seen  do.

524
00:58:42,266 --> 00:58:45,099
But you can not be out drinking and stuff.

525

Come let.

526

As you know shit is not intended to sell friend.

527
00:59:12,241 --> 00:59:14,960
Do not hate her, I have to hear me say

528
00:59:15,161 --> 00:59:18,119
You know what I'm talking about.

532
00:59:25,201 --> 00:59:26,839
I told Lenny,
had things to think about.

533
00:59:26,881 --> 00:59:29,031
Then you just go and do not tell us anything.

534
00:59:29,201 --> 00:59:30,998
They said you had a better job.

535
00:59:31,841 --> 00:59:34,639
No friend, I do not think
is better than anyone here.

536
00:59:34,681 --> 00:59:37,320
Heard you were taking pictures
for weddings or something, that shit cousin.

537
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:41,833
What are you saying?

538
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:45,236
I say disappear, where
Lenny verti like most important

539
00:59:45,436 --> 00:59:48,109
And you say you want to get away before coming
where we.

540
00:59:48,156 --> 00:59:51,387
- And we never say anything
- That disrespect.

541
00:59:51,436 --> 00:59:54,196
Look...

You know what?
Fuck you!

549
01:00:26,154 --> 01:00:28,709
We should shoot the fagot in the face.

01:00:46,330 --> 01:00:48,161
Do not follow me.

551
01:00:48,730 --> 01:00:51,722
Do not want to talk.

552
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:56,168
- Hey, I thought you knew.
- I give a fuck what you have done.

553
01:00:56,810 --> 01:01:00,564

554
01:01:00,770 --> 01:01:04,080

555
01:01:04,129 --> 01:01:05,164

Hey, what's up?

558
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:23,521
Was thinking that we should meet.

559
01:01:24,109 --> 01:01:26,040
If... now.

560
01:01:30,749 --> 01:01:33,058
- Rashid...
- What?

561
01:01:35,209 --> 01:01:38,167
Come on! Rashid.

562
01:01:38,489 --> 01:01:41,481
Wait.

563
01:02:15,284 --> 01:02:17,479
Hey sweetie.

564
01:05:19,427 --> 01:05:22,385
- Hey, are you Rashid?

565
01:05:22,627 --> 01:05:26,256
- Do not know where?
- Never tells me anything.

566
01:05:27,107 --> 01:05:29,098
Yes, really, thanks.

567
01:05:30,907 --> 01:05:33,137
Vanessa.

568
01:05:34,947 --> 01:05:38,462
- Want to buy something?
- I did not know you sold.

569
01:05:38,787 --> 01:05:42,223
- If... - Rashid knows? - Sure.

570
01:05:42,427 --> 01:05:44,895
Ok...

571
01:05:59,542 --> 01:06:01,042
Thanks.

572
01:06:01,690 --> 01:06:02,991
Are you coming here?

573
01:06:05,742 --> 01:06:08,542
- All is well between you, right?
- Sure.

574
01:06:08,552 --> 01:06:10,095
Otherwise not go well with Rashid.

575
01:06:11,571 --> 01:06:13,094
Can you keep a secret?

576
01:06:14,421 --> 01:06:17,777
Not here to see me much.

577
01:06:17,981 --> 01:06:21,576
Has not this response  my messages.

578
01:06:23,061 --> 01:06:24,699
I think he has another woman.

579
01:06:25,071 --> 01:06:26,812
No.

580
01:06:27,001 --> 01:06:28,580
No, you do not have to worry about that.

581
01:06:31,001 --> 01:06:33,609
All he cares about is his work
and his new best friend Sayd.

582
01:06:35,681 --> 01:06:38,493
Yes, but if there was another woman I
would you say it?

583
01:06:39,041 --> 01:06:41,730
Yeah right, you know.

584
01:06:42,380 --> 01:06:44,336
Thanks.

585
01:06:57,256 --> 01:06:59,451
Where were you tonight?

586
01:07:03,106 --> 01:07:05,695
With Vanessa.

587
01:07:13,136 --> 01:07:15,092
Rashid!

588
01:07:19,136 --> 01:07:22,295
- Where are you going?
- Over there.

589
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:24,905
- With Vanessa?
- What?

590
01:07:25,095 --> 01:07:27,095
Do you see it with Vanessa?

591
01:07:29,005 --> 01:07:31,883
No, I have to work.

592
01:07:35,905 --> 01:07:38,013
Great.

593
01:07:54,071 --> 01:07:58,542
Here's all official! Who
thinks I am? Did Paul Escobar?

594
01:07:58,751 --> 01:08:00,343
As if moving kilos of cocaine

595
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:05,142
You should have seen his face.

596
01:08:10,590 --> 01:08:12,148
Oh no!

597
01:08:12,190 --> 01:08:15,190
- Come on dude this is great
- Turn it off

598
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,200
I can not believe that you can hear that shit
Arabic.

599
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:18,750
These are your origins.

600
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:21,182
My origins?
They are horrible origins.

601
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:23,505
Please turn it off.

602
01:08:24,375 --> 01:08:26,981
Enough with that.

603
01:08:41,270 --> 01:08:43,226
Turn it off! Turn it off!

604
01:08:47,086 --> 01:08:49,600
Yes, there is.

605
01:08:50,615 --> 01:08:53,115
I'm here with low profile
like you said.

606
01:08:53,965 --> 01:08:56,923
Yes, it is...
I have been busy with family and stuff.

607
01:09:06,925 --> 01:09:09,962
Cousin Wait are you crazy?
I did not do that.

608
01:09:11,765 --> 01:09:14,438
Ok you know what?
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

609
01:09:15,045 --> 01:09:16,080
'm Upset.

610
01:09:22,245 --> 01:09:25,237
- Is only one kind of the band.
- You owe money.

611
01:09:27,245 --> 01:09:28,564
No.

612
01:09:29,785 --> 01:09:32,036
I wish it were that simple.

613
01:10:41,999 --> 01:10:44,467
- Hey, you got something with you?
- Not now friend.

614
01:10:44,675 --> 01:10:46,235
We do not have anything?

615
01:10:46,235 --> 01:10:48,835
- I have no friend
- We're not going to leave me so.

616
01:10:48,845 --> 01:10:52,067
- I told you I have no friend!
- Okay

617
01:11:40,073 --> 01:11:42,753
- How was your day?
- Well, well.

618
01:11:42,752 --> 01:11:44,185
Yeah?

619
01:11:57,908 --> 01:12:00,138
So there?

620
01:12:00,388 --> 01:12:04,381
- Nothing, forget it.
- Come on, it brought us here for nothing.

621
01:12:07,068 --> 01:12:08,979
- What happens?

622
01:12:09,148 --> 01:12:10,148
Is Rashid.

623
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:12,660
Is he okay?

624
01:12:14,350 --> 01:12:17,650
What about him?
Is everything okay?

625
01:12:17,858 --> 01:12:19,866
Do not know.

626
01:12:23,247 --> 01:12:25,344
Let'm sure can not be that bad.

627
01:12:27,407 --> 01:12:30,267
In God do we want
kill curiosity?

628
01:12:30,427 --> 01:12:32,145
No, no...

629
01:12:35,390 --> 01:12:40,135
- They...
- Do they?

630
01:12:40,347 --> 01:12:42,542
What!

631
01:12:50,463 --> 01:12:52,579
Terrorist shit.

632
01:13:00,263 --> 01:13:02,254
Are you serious?

633
01:13:27,422 --> 01:13:29,922
Maybe you should talk to someone at the mosque.

634
01:13:33,302 --> 01:13:34,735
No. ..

635
01:13:35,262 --> 01:13:38,454
You have to tell your parents.

636
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:42,493
I can not...

637
01:13:43,542 --> 01:13:46,693
Write a review! Do you mean with all this
situation, these bothering me Lenny.

638
01:13:48,097 --> 01:13:51,373
Lenny, are you serious?
Just talk to him, okay?

639
01:13:51,537 --> 01:13:54,609
- Talk to him.

640
01:13:55,657 --> 01:13:57,409

01:14:02,437 --> 01:14:05,490
Even you're setting out to work.

643
01:14:05,537 --> 01:14:08,131
Just tell them that is not going to solve anything
friend.

01:19:31,388 --> 01:19:34,539
Maybe I should call them and see how it goes.

696
01:19:34,668 --> 01:19:36,340

713
01:20:44,683 --> 01:20:49,374
I can not do it unless you know that Mo
will not return.

714
01:20:52,898 --> 01:20:54,536
I am ready to go by the devil.

715
01:20:54,578 --> 01:20:56,534
What?

716
01:20:58,138 --> 01:21:00,493
I am ready to go by the devil.

717
01:21:01,898 --> 01:21:04,287

And nobody messes with my family.

719
01:21:09,058 --> 01:21:11,447
This is how I want to leave.

720
01:21:12,098 --> 01:21:13,372

721
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:19,654
- So, what about Lenny?
- Does not matter.

01:21:22,098 --> 01:21:24,168
How do we know you to get out again?

724
01:21:24,278 --> 01:21:26,414
I said I was ready.

725
01:21:28,797 --> 01:21:30,967
Then I'll go.

726
01:21:38,697 --> 01:21:40,449
Right.

727
01:21:56,213 --> 01:21:58,010
Hello?

732
01:22:21,052 --> 01:22:23,441

733
01:22:24,452 --> 01:22:26,807
Shit, I thought
was with another woman.

734
01:22:33,332 --> 01:22:34,832
I'm so silly.

735
01:22:36,822 --> 01:22:37,892
Not a fool

736
01:22:41,732 --> 01:22:42,732

Yes but do not care about you, not me, not anyone.

739
01:22:55,166 --> 01:22:56,724
Trust me.

740
01:22:57,766 --> 01:23:00,566

816
01:33:12,151 --> 01:33:15,063
Be fine, brother,
calm down.

817
01:33:15,431 --> 01:33:17,547
Sayd is to have to find it.

818
01:33:18,391 --> 01:33:20,985

819
01:33:21,031 --> 01:33:22,066
- Come on.
- Sure it's okay?

820
01:33:22,111 --> 01:33:24,306
If... okay...

821
01:33:33,390 --> 01:33:35,984
- How did you hurt?
- There were problems.

822
01:33:36,030 --> 01:33:38,464
How  happened, brother?

823
01:33:38,710 --> 01:33:43,704
Rashid was behind
The Devil and there was gunfire everywhere.

824
01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:45,706
Y
The Devil came when he wanted to shoot.

825
01:33:46,706 --> 01:33:49,379
If... you know how it is The Devil.

- I do not remember.
-You said you were gone before.

829
01:34:14,484 --> 01:34:16,076
Yes, but I've only gone once.

830
01:34:16,086 --> 01:34:20,163
Listen, go slowly and you tell me if you see something
remember.

831
01:34:31,204 --> 01:34:32,273
See that's your bike.

832
01:34:35,484 --> 01:34:38,317
Listen...
Stay in the car.

833
01:34:42,524 --> 01:34:45,721
Hey Mo, we. Want to find Rashid
or not.

Where the hell is Rashid?

839
01:35:50,434 --> 01:35:52,345
Are you playing with us, cousin?
Where is Rashid?

840
01:36:11,154 --> 01:36:13,349
- Quiet.

Just had to spend something like
to notice.

851
01:39:36,416 --> 01:39:38,153
I never thought
what you said anyway.

852
01:39:45,626 --> 01:39:47,584
Ahi is Rashid.
