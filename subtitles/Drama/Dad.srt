1
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:07,825
Jake, honey,
it's time to get up.

2
00:02:16,035 --> 00:02:17,559
Good morning.

3
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,567
Good morning, Bette.

4
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:26,535
It's a little chilly.
I'll put out a sweater.

5
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,869
Hmm-mmm.

6
00:02:42,795 --> 00:02:44,023
Get dressed now.

7
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,962
I want to be there
when they open.

8
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:47,021
Okay.

9
00:03:16,763 --> 00:03:19,425
I already put sugar in.
One is enough.

10
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:24,631
Here's your napkin.

11
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,486
You want that buttered?

12
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,663
There you go.

13
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:51,212
Good morning.

14
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,091
Watch your step.
The inspector's here.

15
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,894
Good morning, Mrs. Tremont.

16
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,633
Good morning, Mr. Korman.

17
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:08,731
Mr. Tremont.

18
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:09,832
Hello.

19
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,501
The Dodgers did
okay last night. Huh?

20
00:05:11,577 --> 00:05:13,067
Yes.

21
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,210
What can I do for you,
Mrs. Tremont?

22
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,443
It says pork chops on sale.

23
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:21,487
Yes, indeed. Just
follow me right over here.

24
00:05:22,188 --> 00:05:24,247
All of these in
this row right here,

25
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,349
on sale as advertised.

26
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:29,293
What about
these pork chops here?

27
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:30,852
Those are not
the ones on sale.

28
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,057
The ad just says
pork chops, Mr. Korman.

29
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:34,724
It doesn't have
their pictures

30
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:36,996
or their ID numbers.
It just says pork chops.

31
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,402
What is it that you want,
Mrs. Tremont?

32
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:42,236
I want these pork chops
at those prices.

33
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,042
You got it.

34
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,060
Jake.
HUH?

35
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:10,324
Jake.

36
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,037
UH...

37
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,006
Sorry to drop this
on you, John, first thing,

38
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,343
but I have one personnel
problem you should know about.

39
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:25,248
This kid we want to hire can't
decide between us and Goldman.

40
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:26,342
I know you hate this,

41
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:27,647
but I think you have
to step in

42
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,153
and use
your magic touch.

43
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,780
Oh, is he really that good?

44
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:32,515
I can't stand this
recruiting stuff.

45
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,116
All these kids out
of business school

46
00:06:34,193 --> 00:06:35,626
think they're worth $100,000

47
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:37,094
after one week on the job.

48
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,663
I hate their attitudes.

49
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,631
You know,
when I was that age,

50
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,759
I had to walk a mile
in the snow for a stock tip.

51
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,462
This kid's special.
I think you'll find

52
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,528
that out if you spend
a little time with him.

53
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:49,040
All right, arrange it with Kathy
for sometime later this week.

54
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:50,700
I'm booked
for the next few days.

55
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,711
Well, the Vale prospectus
is shaping up well

56
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,940
but management is resisting
our suggestions

57
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:57,380
that we provide data
to help investors understand

58
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,247
why the company
is so profitable.

59
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:02,446
They're afraid of giving too much
information to their competitors.

60
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:03,511
I don't know

61
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,523
why we're dealing
with this Vale guy anyway.

62
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:06,615
He's a shady character.

63
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:08,922
I think we're risking
the reputation of the firm.

64
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:11,486
If we turn him down, we'll
never get his business again.

65
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:12,997
There's a huge fee involved

66
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:14,999
and the banking division
needs the business.

67
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:16,967
I'm worrying
about my bonus this year.

68
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:18,196
Oh, mark that down.

69
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,331
I think that's the earliest
worrying about a bonus ever recorded.

70
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:24,201
Yeah?

71
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,675
It's your sister, Mr. Tremont.

72
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:29,907
She says it's important.
She's has to talk to you now.

73
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,514
Hi, Annie. How are you?

74
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:32,881
I'm in a meeting. What's up?

75
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,476
John, it's about Mom.

76
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,044
She's had a heart attack.

77
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,682
She's okay,
but it's pretty serious.

78
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,225
Can you come out?

79
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:51,325
Hey!

80
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:52,426
How was your flight?

81
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:53,529
All right.

82
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,574
The guy next to me
wouldn't leave me alone.

83
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,666
Once they hear you're on
Wall Street, forget it.

84
00:07:57,743 --> 00:08:00,473
"What about this stock? What about
that stock? What about bonds?"

85
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:01,570
Yeah, I know.

86
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,274
Ever heard of
a stock called Chrometex?

87
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:04,338
Mario.

88
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,408
A guy in the math department
told me about it.

89
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:08,579
They make those heat sensors
for cryogenic capsules.

90
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,315
It's gonna be bigger
than the telephone.

91
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:11,651
No, it's not.

92
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:12,691
It's not?

93
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:13,850
No.

94
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:20,289
How's Annie?
How's she holding up?

95
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:21,924
Good. She's at home
with your father.

96
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,593
We can go there first
or the hospital.

97
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:24,658
Whatever.

98
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:26,204
Let's go to the hospital.

99
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,806
That's what I figured.

100
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,337
How's Dad?

101
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:31,569
To be honest, Johnny,
he's a little shook up.

102
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:32,941
That's why Annie's there.

103
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,639
She didn't want
to leave him alone.

104
00:08:35,748 --> 00:08:37,147
So what's going on with Mom?

105
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:38,682
How serious is this?

106
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:40,776
Hard to tell with her.
You know your mother.

107
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,945
She won't admit she's
actually had a heart attack.

108
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,887
She's lying there
going into cardiac arrest,

109
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:46,686
she's claiming
it's indigestion.

110
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,851
She's blaming me.

111
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:48,985
What do you mean?

112
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:51,120
She said it was the sausages
I made for dinner.

113
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,357
She claims
I was trying to kill her.

114
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:54,694
Are you?

115
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:59,904
No jury would convict me,
John. Believe me.

116
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:02,597
I believe you.

117
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:06,805
I must really be sick
if you're here.

118
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,313
See, Mom,
that's why you're the best.

119
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,282
Not many people
would have gone for guilt

120
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,181
in your situation.

121
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:15,846
How you feeling?
Are you in any pain?

122
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:17,679
I'm staying alive
by willpower.

123
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,347
She'll tell you.

124
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:23,319
I've the willpower of
a woman half my age.

125
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,523
You underestimate yourself.

126
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:27,829
Did you see your father yet?

127
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,697
No, I came straight
from the airport.

128
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:31,930
When you see him,
don't say anything to him

129
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:34,029
about the heart attack.

130
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:38,370
Just tell him that something
went wrong with my insides.

131
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:40,538
Okay?

132
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,039
Mom.

133
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:43,307
Listen to me.

134
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:46,712
Just tell him it's something
with my insides.

135
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:48,617
He'll understand that

136
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,483
because I had
the hysterectomy.

137
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,084
Okay.

138
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,290
There's food in the freezer.
It's all marked.

139
00:09:57,363 --> 00:09:59,126
If you have to go out,

140
00:09:59,465 --> 00:10:00,864
go to McDonald's or Wendy's.

141
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,399
Someplace simple.

142
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:05,234
Mom, I don't think you should
worry about Dad now.

143
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,499
I think you should be
worrying about yourself.

144
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:09,302
You had a heart attack.

145
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,536
I'm not so sure
I had a heart attack.

146
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:13,872
It felt more like
gas pains to me.

147
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,275
Mom, for gas pains
they give you Tums.

148
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:17,680
They don't hook you up

149
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,513
to $20 million
worth of machines.

150
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:22,110
Did you see the doctor
who was taking care of me?

151
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:24,816
Because I don't think
he was a real doctor.

152
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,085
He was wearing tight pants

153
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:29,093
with a big silver
belt buckle.

154
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,397
He can't be more
than 30 years old.

155
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:34,498
They'll let anyone
through medical school

156
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:35,591
these days.

157
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:51,939
John!

158
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,454
God, it's good to see you.

159
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,983
You stopped
and saw Mom first, huh?

160
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,119
Yeah.

161
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:04,856
How did she look
to you, John, really?

162
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,056
Like Mom.

163
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:07,656
Like she was gonna
walk out of there

164
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:08,961
dragging IV bottles with her.

165
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:10,468
Well, it was only gas pains.

166
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:12,003
I'm sure she told you.
Yeah.

167
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,163
And the willpower?

168
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:14,431
A woman half her age.

169
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,304
So you're up to date.

170
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,944
It was scary, John.
I mean it,

171
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,013
I thought we
were gonna lose her.

172
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,275
Where would you
like your bags, sir?

173
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,647
Uh, just put them right there.

174
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:26,707
Thank you very much.

175
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:27,980
No luggage in
the living room.

176
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:29,112
You know the rules.

177
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,712
I'll put them in
your old bedroom.

178
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,315
The living room
is still off limits?

179
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:35,889
Look at this.
Nothing changes.

180
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,219
You're kidding.

181
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:39,787
This place is going directly
as is to the Smithsonian.

182
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:41,025
Dad's out back, huh?

183
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,068
Yeah, in the greenhouse.

184
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:44,695
How's he doing?

185
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,294
Mario said
he took it pretty hard.

186
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,430
He's scared, John.

187
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,201
He's really,
really frightened.

188
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:53,002
I'm not sure he even
understands what happened.

189
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,405
What do you mean?

190
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,707
He's seen her, hasn't he?

191
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:57,009
No. He was too scared.

192
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,243
I didn't want to push it.

193
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:00,308
I told him that she wasn't
allowed to have visitors,

194
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,320
and he seemed okay
with that.

195
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:12,628
Hello, Dad.

196
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:18,693
Hello, John.

197
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:23,197
Nice to see you.
You look good.

198
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:25,974
Good to see you, too.

199
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,904
I'm gonna be
staying here a few days.

200
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:30,881
I know. Annie told me.

201
00:12:32,985 --> 00:12:35,010
You heard
what happened to Mother?

202
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:38,454
Yeah. I was just at
the hospital. I saw her.

203
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:39,980
How is she?

204
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:41,115
Good.
Good.

205
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:42,626
She said to say hello

206
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,890
and tell you
she was comin' home soon.

207
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:48,064
Something went wrong
with her insides, huh?

208
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,933
Yeah, Dad.
Something like that.

209
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:07,378
The heat in your
old room doesn't work,

210
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,442
you know.

211
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,053
You may need
an extra blanket.

212
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:13,483
Okay.

213
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,957
The main thing
for you while you're here

214
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:21,293
will be to keep
everything on an even keel.

215
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,994
Mom has a schedule

216
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:25,628
and their life is
essentially one long routine.

217
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:28,332
Dad gets coffee in
the morning. Decaf.

218
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,869
And a sweet roll.

219
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:34,037
They start the day by clipping
coupons, making out a shopping list.

220
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:35,102
That's very important.

221
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:36,648
I have a list of pills
for you here.

222
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,910
When did he get so bad?
I saw him a year ago.

223
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,144
No, you didn't.

224
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:42,744
What're taking about?
I was here for Christmas.

225
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,120
Annie,
I think I ought to know.

226
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:47,617
All right,
I saw him two years ago.

227
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:49,251
A lot happens in two years.

228
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:50,386
Why didn't you tell me?

229
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:52,760
I told you.
You didn't hear me.

230
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:55,932
We tried moving
him to our place

231
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,366
but he wasn't comfortable.

232
00:13:57,436 --> 00:14:00,098
It's an hour away, and we're
both working during the day.

233
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,298
At least here

234
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:02,897
he has his garden
and his greenhouse.

235
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,499
He knows the environment.

236
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:05,805
I can only stay a few days.

237
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:07,207
What do we do after that?

238
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,473
You can't stay longer?

239
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:10,242
No. I have a meeting
in Toronto, Tuesday.

240
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:11,806
I may have to go to Boston.

241
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:12,976
It's just not possible.

242
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:14,849
We're just gonna have
to bring someone in.

243
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,912
At least we have the time
to find the right person.

244
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,094
Dad just got old, John.

245
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:25,152
Yeah.

246
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,810
Well, Dad, maybe we ought
to hit the sack, huh?

247
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:02,256
Johnny.

248
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:05,834
I can't find my pajamas.

249
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:07,836
I don't know where
Mother keeps them.

250
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:33,697
Here you go.

251
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:45,907
Why don't you
put them on, Dad?

252
00:15:58,457 --> 00:15:59,822
I'll do it.

253
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:23,044
You okay?

254
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:26,941
I miss your mother.

255
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:32,924
Well, she's getting
what she needs.

256
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:34,548
A good rest.

257
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:38,726
She'll be home soon.

258
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:43,766
Good night.

259
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:45,392
Good night.

260
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:47,698
Leave the hall light on.

261
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:48,899
I will.

262
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:50,441
Sleep well.

263
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:33,310
I don't usually eat that much
in the morning, Johnny.

264
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:34,675
It was good, though.

265
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,338
Thank you, Dad.

266
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,717
You do much cooking
at home, do you?

267
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,716
Not too much.

268
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:44,379
Since Sara and I split up,
mostly I eat out.

269
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,117
Yes, she was a nice girl.

270
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:47,453
Still is.

271
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,127
How's Billy?

272
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:52,755
Billy's fine.
He's up in Santa Cruz.

273
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:54,594
Freshman in college.

274
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,827
He came to visit one time.

275
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:59,534
Well, then you've seen him
more than I have.

276
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,606
Oh, look at this, Johnnie.

277
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,708
It's double coupon day
at Ralph's.

278
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:05,709
Tuna at two cans for $1.38.

279
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,778
You can't beat that.

280
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,574
What do you pay
for tuna in New York?

281
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,982
Tuna? I don't know.

282
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,412
Not two for $1.38, I'll bet.

283
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,115
No, I don't think so.

284
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,920
No way, Jose.

285
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:26,558
Listen, Dad,
I'd like to talk to you

286
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:28,395
for a minute about Mom.

287
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:31,635
There's something you should
really try to understand.

288
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:33,227
Mother is sick.

289
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:35,630
It's not cancer, is It?

290
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:37,504
No, no, it's not cancer.

291
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:40,067
That cancer is a killer,
you know.

292
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,978
Your Uncle Ben
had five operations.

293
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,481
Didn't do one
damn thing for him.

294
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:48,413
I tell you,
if you have cancer,

295
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,249
you might as
well pack your bags.

296
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:52,748
Well, it isn't cancer.

297
00:19:52,824 --> 00:19:55,418
It was a heart attack.
A serious one.

298
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:57,861
She'll be okay?

299
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,488
Yeah, she's gonna be okay.

300
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,192
But she's never gonna be able

301
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:02,563
to work as hard
as she used to.

302
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:04,431
She has to learn
to take it easy

303
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,401
and you have
to learn to help her.

304
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:09,565
I'm always telling her
that she works too hard.

305
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:11,734
Johnny, she works too hard.

306
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,005
You're gonna have
to learn to do a lot of things

307
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,569
around the house
by yourself.

308
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:17,239
You see,
Mother's convinced herself

309
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:20,044
nobody can take care
of you except her.

310
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:22,245
We're gonna have
to prove her wrong.

311
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:23,549
That's right, Johnny.

312
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:26,147
I'm going to learn
how to do all those things.

313
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,214
You'll see.

314
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:28,916
We'll fool her.

315
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:31,686
Okay, Dad,

316
00:20:31,763 --> 00:20:34,323
the first thing we have
to do here is, let's see,

317
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:37,732
"Separate the colored articles
of clothing from the whites. "

318
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:39,862
That's so the colors
from the dark stuff

319
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:42,129
don't get on the white stuff.

320
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:43,599
Oh, that's right.

321
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:45,302
I think that's the way
Mother does it.

322
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,366
Oh, good. Good.

323
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:48,310
Then we know
we're on the right track here.

324
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,814
Al right, let's start off
with the coloreds, shall we?

325
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:52,713
Oh, that's colored.

326
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:53,974
Color.

327
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,651
White, colored, colored.

328
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,078
White.

329
00:20:58,957 --> 00:20:59,946
Colored.

330
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:01,848
Colored.

331
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,959
What about this one?

332
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,327
That one? That is white.

333
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,596
Okay, it's colored.

334
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:13,333
Dad, it's gotta be
one of those.

335
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:15,566
Maybe we should call Mother.

336
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:18,738
I'm going to make
an executive decision here.

337
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,108
I think It's colored. Okay?

338
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,077
All right.

339
00:21:23,215 --> 00:21:25,046
Let's see here.
What do you think we have?

340
00:21:25,484 --> 00:21:27,509
"Uh, normal.
Delicate. Permanent Press. "

341
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:29,712
I'm going to go
with "Normal. "

342
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:32,413
What kind of water
do we need?

343
00:21:32,491 --> 00:21:35,858
"Cold-cold, cold-hot,
warm-warm, warm-hot. "

344
00:21:36,028 --> 00:21:37,620
What the hell,
let's live dangerously.

345
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:39,186
Hot-hot.

346
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:42,465
All right. What do you think?

347
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,898
I think it's white.

348
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:48,032
It'll be ready Thursday.

349
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:49,801
All right. How hard was that?

350
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:51,636
Yeah.

351
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,473
What's the best way
to get to the market

352
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:55,638
from here, Dad?

353
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:58,649
Oh, I don't know these streets
very well now, John.

354
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:01,015
Mother drives us
everywhere we go.

355
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:02,747
You don't drive at
all anymore? Ever?

356
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,550
No, I can't.

357
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,419
My license expired
a couple of years ago.

358
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,958
You didn't get
go another one?

359
00:22:08,026 --> 00:22:10,051
Well, they wanted me
to take a driving test

360
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:11,652
because of my age.

361
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,322
Oh, and you failed the test?

362
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:14,422
I didn't take it.

363
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,228
I was afraid
I couldn't pass it.

364
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:17,529
What are you talking about?

365
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,399
You're a terrific driver.
You always were.

366
00:22:19,471 --> 00:22:21,462
Johnny, a good driver
knows when he's not

367
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,804
a good driver anymore,
that's all.

368
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,685
I couldn't remember
what you liked,

369
00:23:13,825 --> 00:23:16,055
so I thought I'd put out
an assortment.

370
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:19,157
Great.

371
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,398
Well...

372
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:32,975
These are good.

373
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:52,858
I think I'd like to
see Mother, Johnny.

374
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:57,126
I'm not sure that's
a good idea just yet, Dad.

375
00:23:57,536 --> 00:23:59,401
I mean, Mom's okay,

376
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:02,770
but they really like to, uh,
limit the number of visitors.

377
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:06,008
I'm her husband.
I should see her.

378
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:08,303
It's not right.

379
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:11,238
No, I'm not sure, Annie,
but if he thinks he's ready,

380
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:14,217
I don't know if we should
be standing in his way.

381
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,514
Pretty good.

382
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:17,111
He made me breakfast
this morning.

383
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:18,850
No, I'm serious.

384
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:21,959
I don't know,
a box of granola. It was good.

385
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:23,516
Yeah.

386
00:24:23,695 --> 00:24:26,630
That sounds right.
All right, bye-bye.

387
00:24:28,567 --> 00:24:29,829
Okay, Dad.

388
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:32,199
Annie's gonna talk to
the people at the hospital.

389
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,795
And she thinks we'll be able
to visit mom in a day or two.

390
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:35,897
Oh, good.

391
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,168
Yeah.

392
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:41,110
You know, Johnny,
I- I think I could do these.

393
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:42,203
What?

394
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,043
I think I could
do the dishes.

395
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:46,174
I made these cards
all color-coded.

396
00:24:46,251 --> 00:24:47,650
There's a different set
of cards

397
00:24:47,719 --> 00:24:48,777
for each chore.

398
00:24:48,854 --> 00:24:49,980
For example, now,

399
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:51,545
these pink ones
are for dishwashing.

400
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:53,955
Go ahead, take a look and
see what number one is.

401
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:55,822
Number one:

402
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:57,528
"Fill sink with water. "

403
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:58,722
Right.

404
00:24:58,864 --> 00:25:00,024
Number two?

405
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:03,631
"Put one squeeze
of soap in water. "

406
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,101
Right.

407
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:07,997
"Put dishes in soapy water. "

408
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,869
I made these for you
to study on your own.

409
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:12,534
This is great, Johnny.

410
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:14,806
There's no way
I could make a mistake

411
00:25:14,946 --> 00:25:17,176
as long as I just
follow these cards.

412
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,647
You know,
you could market these.

413
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:22,109
I'm gonna have to show you

414
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,212
how to work
the stove here, Dad.

415
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:25,847
No, on second thought,

416
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:27,822
the stove is out
of bounds for now.

417
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:29,451
No stove.

418
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:32,624
And don't use
the juicer either. No juicing.

419
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,062
And stay away
from that blender.

420
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:35,224
No blending.

421
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,860
I think I'll work better
with this on.

422
00:25:37,936 --> 00:25:40,769
Your mother doesn't like me
to wear this.

423
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:42,907
Thinks I look too tough.

424
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,672
Like Johnny Cash.

425
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:47,535
You don't mind
If I wear it, do you?

426
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:48,874
No, Dad, I don't mind.

427
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:51,609
Don't take your
guns to town, son

428
00:25:52,284 --> 00:25:54,616
Leave those guns at home

429
00:25:54,686 --> 00:25:55,675
Bang, bang.

430
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,980
"Fill the sink. "

431
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:43,500
That is a professionally
waxed floor, Dad.

432
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:45,569
You can see yourself
in that floor.

433
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:48,435
No waxy yellow build-up.

434
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:50,406
You know what I think?

435
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:52,442
I think we owe
ourselves a reward.

436
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,171
What do you mean?

437
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:56,338
We should go out
and have a good time.

438
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:57,972
What do you say?

439
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:59,209
Okay.

440
00:26:59,417 --> 00:27:00,406
Okay.

441
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:02,813
What do you and Mom do
around here for fun?

442
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:04,548
"I" 20.

443
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,784
"I" two-zero.

444
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:14,923
"0" 75.

445
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,831
Seven-five.

446
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:21,369
"B" 11.

447
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:24,135
"B" one-one.

448
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,910
Right there on top, okay?

449
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:30,043
"G" 58.

450
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:32,706
"G" five-eight.

451
00:27:32,784 --> 00:27:34,911
Enjoying yourself, Johnny?
Having a good time?

452
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,078
You kidding me?

453
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,985
I love this.
I do it all the time at home.

454
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:39,887
Do they have air conditioning
in here, Dad?

455
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:41,892
Or a fan or something?

456
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,928
"I" 22...

457
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,896
Choo-choo!

458
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:48,728
I love when they do that.

459
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,665
They do that all the time?

460
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:53,397
"B" 4.

461
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:55,871
And after!

462
00:27:57,976 --> 00:28:00,410
Boy, this really is too
much fun for one evening.

463
00:28:00,478 --> 00:28:02,776
"I" 19.

464
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,439
Bingo! Bingo!

465
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:11,780
Jake Tremont, is that you?

466
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:14,222
Hal McCarthy.

467
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:15,691
How are you?

468
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:17,226
You remember Gloria?

469
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:19,092
My son, John.
He's visiting from New York.

470
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:20,392
How do you do?

471
00:28:20,465 --> 00:28:22,126
Bette here?

472
00:28:22,267 --> 00:28:23,962
No, she's in the hospital.

473
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,866
No, it's okay.
She had a heart attack,

474
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:27,700
but she's doing fine.
Coming back strong.

475
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:29,467
That's the part
that's good to know.

476
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,974
Please give her our best.

477
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,168
We will. Thank you.

478
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:34,677
You heard about
Nick Price, right?

479
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,210
He's dead.

480
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:40,249
Oh, yeah. Nick,
Robin, Dorothy, the twins.

481
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:42,047
That whole table. Dead.

482
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,212
All of them.

483
00:28:43,288 --> 00:28:44,482
All of them. The whole table.

484
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,786
And Delores Patcher
from the table next to them.

485
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:47,882
Gone.

486
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:49,085
Dead.

487
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:52,820
Well, good seeing you again.

488
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:54,955
It's been a while.
A long time.

489
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:57,294
Nice to meet you.

490
00:28:58,236 --> 00:28:59,897
Boy, they're
a breath of fresh air.

491
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:02,030
Don't mind them, John.
They're crepe-hangers.

492
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:04,075
Know their bingo, though.

493
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,873
You used to come
here a lot, huh, Dad?

494
00:29:06,945 --> 00:29:09,937
Oh, at least once a week.
It was fun.

495
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,217
When was the last time
you played?

496
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:15,709
Must be three years.

497
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:18,517
You're kidding.
Why did you stop coming?

498
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,247
I don't know.

499
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,787
Your mother and I
used to enjoy having fun

500
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:25,091
as much as anybody, but...

501
00:29:25,196 --> 00:29:26,993
We just stopped doing
the things we liked.

502
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:28,726
I don't know why.

503
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,961
Well, you should remember
the fun things

504
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:34,061
you used to do and you
should start doing them.

505
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:35,902
That's a good idea.

506
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:38,032
John, I'm going
to write that down.

507
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,270
I'll make a list of
fun things and I'll do them.

508
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:41,334
Yes, sir.

509
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:42,436
Bingo.

510
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:43,606
What?

511
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:44,739
I think you got bingo.

512
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:47,683
Hey, I got bingo!
Over here! I have bingo!

513
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:53,990
We were awesome tonight, Dad.
We won the "X," the "L"

514
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:55,958
and we were this close
to getting

515
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:58,257
the four corners. That would
have been the triple crown.

516
00:29:58,329 --> 00:29:59,819
I'm worried about you, John.

517
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:01,593
I'm afraid
you're getting addicted.

518
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,326
You know, there's a bingo
game down in Palm Springs

519
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:07,064
somebody told me about.

520
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,765
Run by the Indians.
Big stakes.

521
00:30:08,907 --> 00:30:10,534
We ought to check that out.

522
00:30:10,608 --> 00:30:13,202
We should be able to win, and
win regularly at this game.

523
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:15,872
I got a computer guy in New
York I'm gonna put onto this.

524
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:17,107
Fabulous with numbers.

525
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:18,911
He'll come up
with a system for us.

526
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,041
You'll see.

527
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:21,449
We're gonna beat
these guys, Dad.

528
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,487
Oh, look at that.
It's after 11:00.

529
00:30:23,588 --> 00:30:25,579
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to keep you out so late.

530
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,022
It's okay. It feels good.

531
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,523
It feels like New Year's Eve.

532
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:29,992
All that's missing
is Guy Lombardo.

533
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:31,255
He's dead.

534
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,490
Surprised Hal McCarthy
didn't bring that up.

535
00:30:33,565 --> 00:30:35,465
Big day tomorrow.
Better get some sleep.

536
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:36,693
Good night, John.

537
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,029
Good night, Dad.

538
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:39,962
"B" 4.

539
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:41,196
And after.

540
00:30:44,776 --> 00:30:46,607
There they are, Dad.

541
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:48,974
Hi, Dad.

542
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:50,978
Seen Mom?
How's she doing?

543
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:53,108
Yeah. She looks good.
She's a little feisty.

544
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,913
My mom?
You gotta be kidding me.

545
00:30:54,986 --> 00:30:56,851
You ready to see her, Dad?

546
00:30:56,988 --> 00:30:58,853
Oh, wait a second, Dad.
Let me...

547
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:06,152
I can't believe
how good Dad looks.

548
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:08,091
You really think so?

549
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:10,157
Absolutely. You've been
terrific for him, John.

550
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:11,702
He's been good for me, too.

551
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:13,293
It's been kind of fun.

552
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:15,804
I have a lead on somebody
to take over at the house.

553
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,273
It should only be
a day or two.

554
00:31:17,342 --> 00:31:19,401
That's okay. I didn't know
what you were doing,

555
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:20,739
so I changed my schedule.

556
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:22,177
I can stay
until Mom gets home.

557
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:23,305
Really?

558
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:24,541
Yeah, no big deal.

559
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,095
Hi, Bette.

560
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:55,270
Are you all right?

561
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:56,335
Yeah.

562
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:58,006
You taking your
blood-pressure pills?

563
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,242
Are you eating?

564
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:00,944
Yeah, I'm fine, Bette.

565
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,712
I make my own bed now.

566
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:04,817
And I do the dishes.

567
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,750
John is teaching me to cook.

568
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:08,552
He's like a regular wife.

569
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,321
Just keep him alive
till I get home.

570
00:32:11,396 --> 00:32:13,694
Thank you for
your confidence.

571
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:17,200
Mom looks good, doesn't she?

572
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,860
Yeah, wonderful.

573
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:20,595
I never go anywhere
without my tubes.

574
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:21,900
I meant your color, Mom.

575
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,268
My color?

576
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:25,633
What are you, a decorator?

577
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,605
And don't call me Mom.

578
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:29,440
I don't call you Son, do I?

579
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:32,806
Stop trying to be
so nice to my mother, Mario.

580
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:34,351
You're gonna kill her.

581
00:32:34,419 --> 00:32:35,909
Why are you cooking?

582
00:32:35,987 --> 00:32:37,921
There's food
prepared in the freezer.

583
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:39,115
I told you.

584
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:41,249
It's just for
a little variety, that's all.

585
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:42,691
Last night we had salmon.

586
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,421
The night before
that we had coq au vin.

587
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:46,156
Your father
doesn't like foreign food.

588
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:48,460
It's not foreign. It's
just chicken in red wine.

589
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,501
He's not allowed
to have red wine.

590
00:32:50,568 --> 00:32:52,263
Mom, it was this much.

591
00:32:52,337 --> 00:32:55,101
I don't want him becoming an
alcoholic while I'm in here.

592
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:56,902
Nobody ever
became an alcoholic

593
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,602
from coq au vin.

594
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:02,407
Take it easy, Bette.
Don't get all excited.

595
00:33:03,114 --> 00:33:05,412
You just concentrate
on getting better

596
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,848
and don't worry about me.
You hear?

597
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,254
You sure you
wanna come up, Dad?

598
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:20,797
It could be a long meeting.

599
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:24,357
No, I'll come up.
I'll be okay.

600
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:28,337
I could buy you a lunch here,
you could catch a movie.

601
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:29,667
I'll sit,
I'll read a magazine.

602
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:31,868
I'll be fine.

603
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:33,706
All right.

604
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:43,514
John Tremont to see
Vic Walton, please.

605
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:44,953
He's expecting you.

606
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,014
Dad, you sure you're
gonna be okay out here

607
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,488
with all this construction?

608
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,528
Sure, as long as no one throws
a drop cloth over me.

609
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,596
John, good to see you.

610
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:55,430
Pardon our mess.

611
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,161
No problem.
Good to see you, too, Vic.

612
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:58,896
This is my father,
Jake Tremont.

613
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,061
Dad, this is Vic Walton.

614
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:01,332
Nice to meet you,
Mr. Tremont.

615
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:02,395
And you.

616
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:03,872
We're gonna be
here about an hour?

617
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:04,965
I'd say.

618
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:07,238
All right, well, make yourself
comfortable here, Dad.

619
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:08,300
Wait a minute.

620
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,313
We don't have to leave
your father out here.

621
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,372
Mr. Tremont, why don't you
come in and sit with us?

622
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:13,849
I don't think that-

623
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:15,442
Don't be silly. Come on in.

624
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:20,589
Ralph, we've given you
every benefit of the doubt

625
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:22,352
and yet our projections

626
00:34:22,493 --> 00:34:25,121
still come up 20%
less than yours.

627
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,327
How can you be so confident?

628
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:30,265
You've-you've never run
a business like this before.

629
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:31,858
And if you're wrong,

630
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:33,733
we'll be the
laughingstock of the industry

631
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:35,668
and you'll be off
on another deal.

632
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,469
Forget about
running the cannery.

633
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:39,635
It loses money
every day it's open

634
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,938
but the property it's on

635
00:34:41,012 --> 00:34:42,502
is worth
at least $50 million.

636
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,445
How can you be sure
of the $50 million?

637
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:46,745
We think it's a stretch
to bring it to $40 million.

638
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:48,513
I'd like to see
some supporting data.

639
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,144
If it's supporting data
you need,

640
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:53,349
Brian will give you a package
at the end of the meeting.

641
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:55,516
Now can I get
back to my case?

642
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:56,992
The real estate
is $50 million

643
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:58,585
and we should have no problem

644
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:00,493
turning around their
trucking operation.

645
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:02,328
They let the overhead
get out of hand

646
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,300
but we have
a schedule that shows us

647
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:06,302
cutting back 10% of
the administrative staff

648
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:07,530
in a few months.

649
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:09,197
Aren't you better
off just selling it?

650
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,535
And getting it off your books?

651
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,439
There's no need to,
if we can make it work.

652
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,068
I don't think they
ever focused on it.

653
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:15,544
I think we can turn it.

654
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:18,179
The last piece is
food wholesaling,

655
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:20,410
which has been
a good sector thus far.

656
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:22,885
Now our
cash flow projections

657
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,922
for the division
may look aggressive

658
00:35:24,989 --> 00:35:27,014
but we're comfortable
with them.

659
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:28,558
So, all in all,

660
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,421
the banks shouldn't have
any problem financing us.

661
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,167
Well, that was fun.

662
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:40,102
Johnny, what the hell was
goin' on back there?

663
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:41,832
Well, we were talking
about buying

664
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:43,305
a salmon cannery, Dad.

665
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:46,275
I didn't know you knew
about stuff like that.

666
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:48,107
Actually, I don't.

667
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:50,704
The guy coming to us
for money doesn't either.

668
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:52,214
We're just gonna
buy the company

669
00:35:52,283 --> 00:35:53,773
and then close it down.

670
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,249
That's your job?

671
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,346
You buy companies,
then close them down?

672
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:02,483
It's a little more
complicated than that, Dad.

673
00:36:02,693 --> 00:36:04,661
Take this cannery,
for instance.

674
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:06,763
Turns out to be
a lousy business.

675
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,526
It's
third-generation management,

676
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:10,226
and they've let it
run down terribly.

677
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:12,098
But they have
a small subsidiary

678
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,398
that's a real gem.

679
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:16,440
The cannery itself is sitting
on prime waterfront land.

680
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:19,271
So we buy the company,
close it down,

681
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,937
then we sell off
the subsidiary business,

682
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,378
then we sell the land.

683
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:27,044
You ever thought of maybe
running these companies?

684
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:29,348
There's no money
in that, Dad.

685
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:32,449
The world has changed, Johnny.

686
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:36,284
You wouldn't believe
how the world has changed.

687
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,761
When you were a boy,
you used to go to work

688
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:45,267
at Lockheed with me,
you remember?

689
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:48,265
I used to separate
all the nuts and bolts.

690
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:51,797
32 cents a day and all the
ham-and-cheese sandwiches I could eat.

691
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,003
You used to say
when you grew up,

692
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:56,171
you wanted to
work there, like me.

693
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:01,610
Now I guess you'd just buy it
and close it down.

694
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:04,579
You ever hear

695
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:07,055
from any of those
old Lockheed guys, Dad?

696
00:37:07,124 --> 00:37:09,752
Rick Malinson?
Tommy Williams?

697
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:11,419
By the time I retired,

698
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:14,259
I was the last of us
still working there.

699
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:16,729
They all moved out.

700
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:19,131
To the Valley,
Palm Springs...

701
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,397
My last day,

702
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:26,304
I finished my work,

703
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:28,868
cleaned out my locker
and went home.

704
00:37:28,946 --> 00:37:32,040
There was no one even there
to say good-bye to.

705
00:37:33,818 --> 00:37:35,308
Next morning,

706
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:38,287
someone else doing my job
like I'd never been there.

707
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:43,084
The world is
divided into two groups:

708
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:44,851
workers and bosses.

709
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,227
I'm a worker.
Always have been.

710
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:49,330
I don't know, Dad, I think-

711
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,697
It's okay, Johnny.

712
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,531
There's nothing
wrong with it.

713
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,332
I'm a worker, that's all.

714
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:56,530
But you, you're different.

715
00:37:56,874 --> 00:37:58,808
You like to be in control.

716
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,877
You like that responsibility.

717
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,707
You're a boss.

718
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:05,743
And Mom?

719
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,980
What do you think?

720
00:38:17,928 --> 00:38:18,917
Okay, Dad.

721
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:21,430
"If you hit a parked vehicle
and cannot find the owner

722
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:23,399
"you must A: Leave
a note on or in the car,

723
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:25,332
Wait for the owner to return

724
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:27,496
or C: Leave a message
at the nearest house?"

725
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:28,936
Why are you doing this?

726
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:30,633
I've already passed
the written test.

727
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:32,266
I know,
but you can't be too careful.

728
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:33,401
One of these
very situations

729
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,672
may appear during the
driving portion of the test.

730
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:36,838
I want you to be ready.

731
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:38,711
If I hit a car in
the driving test,

732
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:40,182
it isn't gonna matter

733
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:42,310
if I "A: Leave a note on
or in the car or not. "

734
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:43,410
Very good.

735
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:44,545
Thank you.

736
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:45,884
We've come this far.

737
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:47,719
I don't want to see
anything go wrong now.

738
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:50,317
They want us to pull
ahead here. Go ahead.

739
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:51,656
Ease up, ease up,
not too fast.

740
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:53,026
All right, stop.

741
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:58,226
There he is now.

742
00:38:58,636 --> 00:38:59,660
Jake Tremont?

743
00:38:59,804 --> 00:39:00,964
Yes, sir. Here. Right here.

744
00:39:01,038 --> 00:39:02,471
Actually, he's Jake Tremont.

745
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,007
I'm his son, John.

746
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:05,667
You probably don't
need to know that,

747
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:07,608
but now you do anyway.

748
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:19,488
You can't sit there
during the test, sir.

749
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:21,149
Oh, I'm sorry.

750
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:30,393
Uh, you can't be
in the car at all.

751
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:31,560
What are you talking about?

752
00:39:31,635 --> 00:39:32,727
This is my father.

753
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:34,065
It's against the law.

754
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:36,732
I won't say a word.
You won't even know I'm here.

755
00:39:36,807 --> 00:39:39,241
I can't administer the test
with you in the car.

756
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,834
Either you get out now,

757
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:43,402
or your father
gets a failing grade.

758
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:46,945
You going to be okay?

759
00:39:47,017 --> 00:39:49,144
I will be
as soon as you go.

760
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:54,047
Before opening the door on the
traffic side of your parked car-

761
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:55,114
John.

762
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:56,420
I'm going.

763
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,860
Look for bicycles
and other vehicles.

764
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:02,023
Yes!

765
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:07,028
When waiting to
make a left turn,

766
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:10,232
give the right of way to cars
coming in the opposite direction.

767
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:13,743
Until all dangerously
close cars have passed.

768
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:16,803
On a highway with fewer than
four lanes in one direction

769
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:19,179
a passenger vehicle
towing a trailer...

770
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,514
Must travel in
the lane farthest to the right

771
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,416
or a specially marked lane.

772
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:25,981
Yes!

773
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,608
Well, look who's here.

774
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:01,615
Yo, Dad.

775
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:04,885
Yo, Billy.

776
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:07,279
Well...

777
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,053
I was down

778
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:14,893
at the American Express office
in Tecoman

779
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:16,398
and I got a letter
from Aunt Annie.

780
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:17,866
Told me that
Grandma was sick.

781
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:19,232
So I hustled back.

782
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:21,168
I figured you might need
some help, Grandpa.

783
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:22,830
Never mind
helping your Grandpa.

784
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:24,636
When was
the last time you ate?

785
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:27,741
Why are you Americans
so obsessed with food?

786
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:30,302
Excuse me, senor.
You're not...

787
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:32,841
You know, when in Rome...

788
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:35,417
What were you
doing down in Mexico?

789
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:36,680
Semester break.

790
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:38,085
A bunch of kids
went down there.

791
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:39,782
You look good.
I think you've grown.

792
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:41,825
Dad, you say that
every time you see me.

793
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,826
And I stopped
growing two years ago.

794
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,093
How's your mother?

795
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:47,596
She's fine.

796
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:50,190
In her third year of law,
top of her class.

797
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:51,962
It's embarrassing
when your mother

798
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:54,061
has a higher grade point
average than you do

799
00:42:54,138 --> 00:42:55,366
but we're working that out.

800
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:57,066
Send her my best.

801
00:42:57,541 --> 00:42:59,566
How about you?
You know? How's business?

802
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:01,076
You know. The same.

803
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:02,703
You win some, you lose some.

804
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:06,245
Knowing you, I'm sure you're
winning more than you're losing.

805
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:08,080
When you finish with that,

806
00:43:08,152 --> 00:43:10,518
you can wash it down
with a piece of cake.

807
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,121
He looks really good.

808
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,657
What's been going on?

809
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,760
Well, we've been spending
a lot of time together.

810
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:21,627
Quality time, huh?

811
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:23,562
They say it's good
for parents and kids.

812
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:26,626
Maybe you and I should spend
some more time together.

813
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:30,799
Take it easy, Dad.
Let's not get carried away.

814
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,573
This place looks
great, Grandpa.

815
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:39,240
You've added a lot.

816
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:44,577
You look good.

817
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:51,155
I'm gonna name this
one after you, Bill.

818
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:03,455
Butter, anyone?

819
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,090
You want some butter, honey?

820
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:10,032
I would like to make a toast.

821
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:11,096
Uh-oh.

822
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:14,535
A lot's happened
in the past two weeks.

823
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:16,203
We've overcome
a lot of adversity,

824
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,747
overcome a lot of pain.

825
00:45:17,815 --> 00:45:19,749
Pulled together as a team.

826
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:22,377
And now we're taking
time to say thanks.

827
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:23,715
That's beautiful, Mario.

828
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:25,652
It's my regular
halftime speech.

829
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,623
Actually,
I just wanted to say

830
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:29,692
how happy I am to see
the family together.

831
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,819
It's a thrill for me, too.
Are you finished?

832
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,886
My chicken's getting cold.

833
00:45:33,964 --> 00:45:35,454
I'm finished.

834
00:45:36,266 --> 00:45:37,255
Very good.

835
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:39,325
I'd like to make a toast.

836
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:41,304
Hmm.

837
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:42,736
Well, hey, Dad.

838
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,639
To my lovely bride.

839
00:45:49,113 --> 00:45:50,478
Your bride?

840
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:54,280
Did you have
a drink today, Jake?

841
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:55,443
Before you came home, Mom,

842
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:57,714
we had a couple of
glasses of coq au vin.

843
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,486
To my lovely bride.

844
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:05,084
Bette, you're back
in the bosom of your family,

845
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:06,424
where you belong.

846
00:46:08,699 --> 00:46:10,462
It's good to be home.

847
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:12,459
Hear, hear.

848
00:46:12,536 --> 00:46:13,560
Well said, Dad.

849
00:46:14,705 --> 00:46:16,332
It's good to have
everybody here, too.

850
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:17,805
I can't remember
the last time

851
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:19,240
we had John and
Billy together.

852
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:20,936
Billy looks good.

853
00:46:21,011 --> 00:46:22,535
I like that earring.

854
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:24,237
Think I should
get one of those?

855
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:25,440
Yeah. It's very nice.

856
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:27,484
I have a pin that goes
with that if you want.

857
00:46:27,551 --> 00:46:29,849
Oh, leave him alone, Mom.
He looks fabulous.

858
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,911
I bet the girls are
falling all over themselves.

859
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:32,978
Don't worry about me.

860
00:46:33,056 --> 00:46:34,216
This isn't at
all embarrassing.

861
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,225
I hear the dorms are
co-ed now. Is that true?

862
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:37,282
Yeah our dorm's co-ed.

863
00:46:37,361 --> 00:46:39,329
Good thing they didn't have it
when I was in school.

864
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:41,057
I never would've got
any studying done.

865
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,359
Some student you were.

866
00:46:42,432 --> 00:46:44,696
Mario was
an excellent student, Mom.

867
00:46:44,768 --> 00:46:46,929
He was a
physical education major.

868
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:49,131
He didn't read books,
he ran laps.

869
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:50,935
Yes, but good students
like me read books

870
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:52,669
and ran laps
at the same time.

871
00:46:52,743 --> 00:46:54,506
Now John was a good student.

872
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:55,602
Thank you, Mommy.

873
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:56,839
From kindergarten on,

874
00:46:56,914 --> 00:46:59,007
every Saturday we'd
go to the library.

875
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:00,071
Get out four books.

876
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,708
You'd read them,
we'd go back,

877
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:03,309
get out another four books.

878
00:47:03,387 --> 00:47:05,446
It worked, too.
I learned how to read.

879
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:06,750
You did more than that.

880
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:07,984
So how does it work?

881
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:10,356
Are the girls on another
floor? How do you find them?

882
00:47:10,427 --> 00:47:12,588
Somebody hose this man down.

883
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:18,263
What is it, Dad?
What's the matter?

884
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:23,362
I'm just happy.

885
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:32,006
Let's try to make it easy
for Grandma and Grandpa

886
00:47:32,082 --> 00:47:33,606
while you're here. Okay?

887
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,208
Sure, you get so used
to hearing it,

888
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:36,752
you don't even
realize it's on.

889
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:38,117
It was on, believe me.

890
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:39,586
My fillings are
still rattling.

891
00:47:39,656 --> 00:47:40,816
Sorry.

892
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:44,354
So when do you have
to be back at school?

893
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:46,521
I don't know.
I may not go back to school.

894
00:47:46,597 --> 00:47:48,531
I'm thinking of
going back down to Mexico

895
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:50,294
to live for a while.

896
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,959
What's the big attraction
with Mexico?

897
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,128
All the people in Mexico
are trying to come here.

898
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:55,432
Did you know that?

899
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:57,871
A lot of kids from school
are down there.

900
00:47:57,941 --> 00:47:59,465
They've got
a little community going.

901
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,033
It's, uh, it's fun.

902
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:06,482
Okay, it's fun,
but believe it or not,

903
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:08,585
you may want
a job someday, Bill.

904
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:10,085
Lying on the beach in Mexico

905
00:48:10,153 --> 00:48:12,553
is not going to help prepare
you for anything.

906
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:14,784
Unless you want to
be a mariachi singer,

907
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:17,120
in which case
it's a work-study program.

908
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:18,889
I could say
I went to college.

909
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:21,294
Nobody checks.
I'll say I have a B.A.

910
00:48:22,165 --> 00:48:23,530
I'll say I have a PhD.

911
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,897
Might as well do it right.

912
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:26,333
Two PHDs.

913
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:27,835
One in chemistry,
one in physics.

914
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:30,806
I have to go back to New York
soon, and I'd like this settled.

915
00:48:30,874 --> 00:48:31,932
What's your mother think?

916
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:34,443
She said I should use
my best judgment.

917
00:48:34,511 --> 00:48:36,308
I'm not sure how
I feel about this.

918
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:38,371
We should talk
about this a little bit.

919
00:48:38,448 --> 00:48:40,075
I- I don't see why.

920
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,518
We haven't talked
about it up until now,

921
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:43,985
and I think
I know what I want.

922
00:48:44,054 --> 00:48:46,420
Johnny, something's wrong.

923
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:49,882
Would you come
here and take a look?

924
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:03,636
That'll be all for now,
Mr. Tremont.

925
00:49:03,707 --> 00:49:05,504
You can get dressed
if you like.

926
00:49:05,575 --> 00:49:06,633
Is he all right?

927
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:07,835
Yes, he's fine.

928
00:49:07,911 --> 00:49:09,105
It's a very
painful procedure.

929
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:10,237
No getting around it.

930
00:49:10,314 --> 00:49:11,975
Any idea what
the problem might be?

931
00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:13,607
Could be any of
a number of things.

932
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:15,379
I suspect small growths
in his bladder.

933
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:16,942
The question is,
are they malignant?

934
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:19,284
Will the tests you've
just done tell you that?

935
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:20,823
Not completely.

936
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:23,257
The fact they're bleeding
is not a good sign.

937
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:25,627
So this is serious?

938
00:49:26,229 --> 00:49:29,528
Yes. I think we should schedule
him for exploratory surgery.

939
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:34,127
If it were serious, Dad,

940
00:49:34,204 --> 00:49:35,933
they wouldn't have
let you out of there.

941
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:37,530
They would've
cut you right open

942
00:49:37,607 --> 00:49:39,165
and operated on the spot.

943
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:40,800
I wouldn't be
surprised at all

944
00:49:40,877 --> 00:49:41,866
if it were just a cyst.

945
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:45,679
Just a cyst? Right.

946
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:48,175
I don't even think
it's worth telling Mom about.

947
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:50,082
Why worry her for nothing?

948
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:52,178
Whatever you say, Johnny.

949
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:55,255
You're the boss.

950
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:02,930
He told you, didn't he?

951
00:50:03,066 --> 00:50:04,465
Of course, he told me.

952
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:06,365
Well, then you know
it's nothing serious.

953
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:07,698
If it wasn't serious,

954
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:09,602
you'd have told me
about it yourself.

955
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:12,403
Look, Mom, you're supposed
to avoid any stress right now.

956
00:50:12,476 --> 00:50:14,603
I was afraid you might
get upset about nothing.

957
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:15,906
That's why I didn't tell you.

958
00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:18,846
I'm sorry. Maybe I was wrong, but
that's what I was trying to do.

959
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:20,906
He says it's just a cyst.

960
00:50:20,984 --> 00:50:21,951
That's right.

961
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:23,884
That's a fairly
simple procedure.

962
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:25,012
Yes, it is.

963
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:27,181
Mother, I'd tell you
if there was anything wrong.

964
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:28,781
I would.

965
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:30,619
Okay.

966
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:43,772
Do I walk around
like this, John,

967
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:45,875
with the back open
and all the nurses here?

968
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:47,967
Yeah. It says right here
on the admission slip,

969
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,842
"Dress is informal. "

970
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:51,312
There you go.

971
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:52,845
You need to sign this, Dad.

972
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:54,178
What is it?

973
00:50:54,251 --> 00:50:56,116
It just says if
anything happens to you,

974
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:57,744
I get your catcher's mitt.

975
00:50:57,821 --> 00:50:59,846
I don't have
a catcher's mitt.

976
00:50:59,923 --> 00:51:01,515
Sorry. Bad joke.

977
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,417
Dr. Santana
ordered this medication.

978
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:07,156
It's just something
to relax you.

979
00:51:07,497 --> 00:51:10,432
If you have any left over,
I'd like a little.

980
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:19,938
Guess you have to pay extra
to get one with a personality.

981
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:21,602
What time is it?

982
00:51:22,446 --> 00:51:23,845
About noon.

983
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:26,106
Not much longer.

984
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:27,411
Nope.

985
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:30,184
Is this comfortable
for you, Dad?

986
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:31,550
Fine.

987
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:33,785
I'm gonna let you rest now.

988
00:51:33,857 --> 00:51:36,087
That stuff's gonna
really mellow you out.

989
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:37,148
Okay.

990
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:39,592
Don't forget,
if you need anything,

991
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:41,324
just ring the buzzer here.

992
00:51:46,703 --> 00:51:48,671
I guess this is it, huh?

993
00:51:50,907 --> 00:51:52,704
You're gonna be okay.

994
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:56,706
You know, John,
I see men now,

995
00:51:57,881 --> 00:51:59,143
they hug.

996
00:52:00,884 --> 00:52:02,647
We've never hugged.

997
00:52:05,722 --> 00:52:07,553
Wanna give it a try?

998
00:52:08,825 --> 00:52:09,951
I do.

999
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:26,570
I love you, Johnny.

1000
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:30,438
I love you, too, Dad.

1001
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,507
Well, Mr. Tremont,
I'm afraid it's cancer.

1002
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:39,314
Cancer.

1003
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:41,448
Yes. There were
several malignant tumors.

1004
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:43,356
I think I got 'em,
but we have to do

1005
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:45,325
some chemotherapy.
We won't radiate.

1006
00:52:45,395 --> 00:52:47,920
Not with a man with
your father's age.

1007
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,829
Maybe this is
a silly question,

1008
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:51,265
but are you absolutely sure?

1009
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:52,392
Yes.

1010
00:52:52,903 --> 00:52:54,666
A virulent form, too.
It's a good thing

1011
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:56,467
we went in
and got it when we did.

1012
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,303
Listen, Dr. Santana.

1013
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:00,005
Whatever you do,

1014
00:53:00,076 --> 00:53:02,169
don't mention
cancer to my father.

1015
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:05,280
He's terribly anxious and
frightened about that word.

1016
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:07,009
It's beyond
anything rational.

1017
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:08,448
Calm down, Mr. Tremont.

1018
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:11,009
You'd be surprised what these
older people can take.

1019
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:12,952
Their children tend
to underestimate them.

1020
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,150
I don't
underestimate him, Doctor.

1021
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:18,293
I want to be the one
to tell him, that's all.

1022
00:53:19,396 --> 00:53:21,261
It's cancer, isn't it?

1023
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:22,821
Mom, I told you.

1024
00:53:22,899 --> 00:53:25,367
It's a cyst and they
took it out. That's all.

1025
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,366
I want to go see him.

1026
00:53:27,437 --> 00:53:28,768
Mom!

1027
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:32,399
Mom, you can't go
see him right now.

1028
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,472
Will you
listen to me?

1029
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:37,342
You can't expose yourself
to that kind of stress.

1030
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:39,575
If he was all right,
you'd let me see him.

1031
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:40,877
Oh, come on, Mom.

1032
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:43,215
John's only thinking about
what's best for you.

1033
00:53:43,286 --> 00:53:44,412
You know that.

1034
00:53:44,487 --> 00:53:46,978
You got to listen to him,
Mom. Come on.

1035
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:50,453
This is my husband
and I'm gonna see him.

1036
00:53:50,527 --> 00:53:52,893
Now, either you're gonna
drive me or I'm gonna walk,

1037
00:53:52,963 --> 00:53:54,453
but I'm goin'.

1038
00:54:01,137 --> 00:54:02,627
Dad?
What is it?

1039
00:54:02,706 --> 00:54:03,832
What's out there?

1040
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:05,932
There's nothing, Dad.
You're in the hospital.

1041
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:07,874
It's fine.
There's nothing the matter.

1042
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:11,138
Billy, go get
Dr. Santana right now.

1043
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:13,273
Just do it!

1044
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:14,476
Get her out of here.

1045
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:15,609
What's the matter
with him?

1046
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:17,152
Jake, it's me!

1047
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,085
Why doesn't he know me? Jake!

1048
00:54:20,323 --> 00:54:22,154
Mr. Tremont, I'm Dr. Santana.

1049
00:54:22,225 --> 00:54:23,214
Do you know who I am?

1050
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:26,956
I'm fine.
I'm just fine, thank you.

1051
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:29,396
He's in shock.
Give him 25 mg Librium IM

1052
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:31,127
and check his vitals
every two hours.

1053
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:32,133
Yes, Doctor.

1054
00:54:32,202 --> 00:54:33,999
This is fairly standard
with older people.

1055
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:36,334
They often go into delayed
shock even after minor surgery.

1056
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:37,566
This is standard?

1057
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:39,575
Do you have any idea
what happened in there?

1058
00:54:39,643 --> 00:54:41,838
I'm sure it was a frightening
experience for you,

1059
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:43,242
but what you got to
understand is

1060
00:54:43,313 --> 00:54:46,077
that what we're dealing with here
actually is a form of senility.

1061
00:54:46,149 --> 00:54:47,741
He wasn't senile
when he came in.

1062
00:54:47,817 --> 00:54:49,546
Why should he
suddenly go into senility?

1063
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:51,849
Senility is a very strange
thing. It comes and goes.

1064
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:54,287
You get a stress situation
like this and it just crops up.

1065
00:54:54,357 --> 00:54:56,257
I'm sure, with proper
rest and medication,

1066
00:54:56,326 --> 00:54:58,157
the situation
will correct itself.

1067
00:54:58,228 --> 00:54:59,422
What do we do
in the meantime?

1068
00:54:59,496 --> 00:55:00,463
Nothing.

1069
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:01,997
What do you mean
"nothing"?

1070
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:03,896
No tests, no consultations?
We just wait?

1071
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:06,265
We wait for him to respond
to the medication.

1072
00:55:06,503 --> 00:55:08,334
He'll be fine. Don't worry.

1073
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:11,466
Did you tell my father
he has cancer?

1074
00:55:15,779 --> 00:55:17,440
You have to understand,
Mr. Tremont,

1075
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:19,448
I have an ethical obligation
to my patients.

1076
00:55:19,516 --> 00:55:21,381
He had a right to know.

1077
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:26,720
I'm not quite sure what it is
you want me to do, Mr. Tremont.

1078
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:28,087
Dr. Ethridge,

1079
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:31,616
I don't have a lot of
confidence in Santana.

1080
00:55:32,595 --> 00:55:34,654
And you're
the hospital administrator,

1081
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:36,426
and I just want you
to know

1082
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:38,490
that this
doesn't feel right.

1083
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:40,536
Dr. Santana is
a fine young surgeon.

1084
00:55:40,603 --> 00:55:42,594
It seems to me that
he's been very thorough

1085
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:44,606
and professional in
your father's case.

1086
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:46,369
I told him not
to say anything

1087
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:47,602
about cancer to my father

1088
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:49,941
because he's very
frightened by that word.

1089
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,344
He went ahead
and told him anyway.

1090
00:55:52,582 --> 00:55:55,016
Well, it's always
a difficult call for a doctor.

1091
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:57,315
He has to balance
the will of the family members

1092
00:55:57,387 --> 00:55:59,150
with the patient's right
to know.

1093
00:55:59,222 --> 00:56:00,746
I'm sure he had no choice.

1094
00:56:00,824 --> 00:56:02,086
He had a choice.

1095
00:56:02,158 --> 00:56:03,750
He could have listened to me.

1096
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:05,124
I know my father.

1097
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,753
And what's happening
to him right now

1098
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:07,922
is a direct result

1099
00:56:07,997 --> 00:56:09,988
of Dr. Santana's
poor judgment.

1100
00:56:21,010 --> 00:56:22,739
Why did you
strap his arms down?

1101
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:24,609
To keep him from
hurting himself.

1102
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:27,946
He's been flailing around
pretty good with those hands.

1103
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:30,850
Yeah, well, I'm his son and I
say he doesn't need these things.

1104
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,649
Give us a call
when you're ready,

1105
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:33,950
and we'll put
him back in bed.

1106
00:56:34,023 --> 00:56:35,786
I don't believe it.

1107
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,822
Hey, dad,
how you doin'?

1108
00:56:38,495 --> 00:56:40,759
What is it? Does he
always look like this?

1109
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:42,923
Look, hey, look,
look, I've brought Annie.

1110
00:56:42,999 --> 00:56:44,796
And I got
Billy here. Huh?

1111
00:56:44,868 --> 00:56:45,857
Hey, Dad.

1112
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:48,293
How are you
feelin', Dad?

1113
00:56:48,605 --> 00:56:49,799
Can you hear me?

1114
00:56:49,873 --> 00:56:52,774
Hey, Grandpa, it's me, Billy.
How you doin'?

1115
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:56,643
God, John, I can't stand
to see him looking like this.

1116
00:56:56,713 --> 00:56:59,147
What is it, Dad?
What's the matter?

1117
00:57:12,962 --> 00:57:16,227
That would be
absolutely adequate, I think.

1118
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,064
I gave him a sedative.
That should calm him down.

1119
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:20,363
How long had he
been like that?

1120
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:22,530
The whole time we've been
here. At least half an hour.

1121
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:24,106
Did he seem
depressed?

1122
00:57:24,174 --> 00:57:25,232
Jesus, Doctor.

1123
00:57:25,308 --> 00:57:27,003
It's a good thing
you're not a detective.

1124
00:57:27,076 --> 00:57:28,304
Yeah, he seemed
depressed.

1125
00:57:28,378 --> 00:57:30,278
What the hell do you
think is going on here?

1126
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:32,041
I meant more than usual,
Mr. Tremont.

1127
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:35,380
He's been sliding every day since
he's been in here. And you know that.

1128
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:36,441
Mr. Tremont-

1129
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:38,646
You're not gonna tell me
that this is normal behavior.

1130
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:41,451
This particular manifestation
of the depression is unusual,

1131
00:57:41,524 --> 00:57:43,549
true, but the sedative
will bring him around.

1132
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:45,218
A sedative?
The man is hallucinating.

1133
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,694
He's crying nonstop.

1134
00:57:46,763 --> 00:57:48,628
He doesn't recognize
anyone in his family,

1135
00:57:48,698 --> 00:57:50,529
and you're
giving him a sedative?

1136
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,568
And why didn't you give him
some Sucrets, too?

1137
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:54,296
Maybe he has a sore
throat you can fix!

1138
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:56,531
We've scheduled your father
for release tomorrow.

1139
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:58,335
You can pick him
up anytime after 12:00.

1140
00:57:58,408 --> 00:57:59,875
What do you mean,
"release"?

1141
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:02,070
Are you trying to tell me that
my father has recovered?

1142
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:04,136
Well, no, of course not,
but medically speaking

1143
00:58:04,214 --> 00:58:05,841
there's nothing more
we can do for him.

1144
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:07,041
We cannot hold
hospital beds

1145
00:58:07,116 --> 00:58:09,209
for patients who cannot
profit from medical care.

1146
00:58:09,285 --> 00:58:10,309
How would we know?

1147
00:58:10,386 --> 00:58:11,876
He's never gotten
any medical care!

1148
00:58:11,955 --> 00:58:13,445
You have to understand,
Mr. Tremont,

1149
00:58:13,523 --> 00:58:15,787
while his condition is stable,
basically he's custodial.

1150
00:58:15,859 --> 00:58:16,951
What exactly
does that mean?

1151
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:18,220
I'll tell you
what that means.

1152
00:58:18,294 --> 00:58:20,455
That means they don't give
a shit if he lives or dies.

1153
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:22,395
He's not custodial!
God damn it!

1154
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:24,490
What kind of word is that
to describe a person?

1155
00:58:24,567 --> 00:58:25,556
I don't think-

1156
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:26,602
Just calm down.

1157
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:28,034
You want my father
out of here?

1158
00:58:28,104 --> 00:58:29,366
Well, let me tell you
something.

1159
00:58:29,439 --> 00:58:31,134
I want him out of here
more than you do.

1160
00:58:31,207 --> 00:58:33,004
You're not good enough
to take care of him.

1161
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:34,134
John,
what are you doing?

1162
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:35,575
Mr. Tremont-
Don't you touch him.

1163
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:36,942
This is
very unnecessary.

1164
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:38,571
I said I'm taking him home.

1165
00:58:38,648 --> 00:58:40,946
Mr. Tremont,
this is very unfortunate.

1166
00:59:04,274 --> 00:59:05,969
What do we do now?

1167
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:08,233
I don't know.

1168
00:59:08,444 --> 00:59:09,809
We may have no choice
but to-

1169
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:11,176
No, I don't want
to do that.

1170
00:59:11,247 --> 00:59:12,942
I don't wanna put
him in a nursing home.

1171
00:59:13,016 --> 00:59:15,416
I don't either, John,
but we have to do something.

1172
00:59:15,518 --> 00:59:17,349
If you take Mom
out to your place,

1173
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:19,217
I'll take care
of Dad at home.

1174
00:59:19,289 --> 00:59:20,483
Wait a second, John.

1175
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:22,218
You can't handle
him in this condition.

1176
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:23,486
I think
I can do it.

1177
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,152
I can do better
than the hospital did.

1178
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,217
I can stay and help.

1179
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:27,263
No.

1180
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:28,456
Why not?

1181
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:30,123
I'll take care of him.
He's my father.

1182
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:31,257
Well, he's my grandfather.

1183
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:32,358
And I'm
your father.

1184
00:59:32,435 --> 00:59:34,426
Great. Now that we
know who everyone is,

1185
00:59:34,504 --> 00:59:36,495
can we talk about
what's best for this man?

1186
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:38,300
I don't want you
here right now, Billy.

1187
00:59:38,374 --> 00:59:40,001
You don't have to see this.

1188
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,543
Dad, I am not a kid.

1189
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:42,737
Look,
I want you gone.

1190
00:59:42,812 --> 00:59:44,871
Go back to school,
go back to Mexico.

1191
00:59:44,948 --> 00:59:46,176
You're
in the way here.

1192
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:47,614
Don't you
understand?

1193
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,647
Yeah, I understand.

1194
01:00:00,897 --> 01:00:02,762
I want to
talk to him.

1195
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:04,695
It's not a good
idea now, Mom, really.

1196
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:06,064
Annie's right,
Mom.

1197
01:00:06,202 --> 01:00:07,533
Come on,
get in the hearse.

1198
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:09,663
You'd like that,
wouldn't you, Mario?

1199
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:11,297
I meant "get in the car,"
Mom.

1200
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:13,467
It was
a slip of the tongue.

1201
01:00:22,885 --> 01:00:26,116
Okay, Mom, okay. Come on,
come on. He'll be all right.

1202
01:00:26,189 --> 01:00:27,178
He'll be all right.

1203
01:00:27,256 --> 01:00:28,883
John's gonna
take care of him.

1204
01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:32,554
Here we go, Dad.

1205
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:37,162
We got a score yet? Huh?

1206
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:41,228
This kid Gooden is fabulous,
isn't he?

1207
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:43,067
He kind of reminds
me of Bob Gibson.

1208
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:45,232
You know,
a real competitor.

1209
01:00:52,515 --> 01:00:55,075
What is that?
Did you get that, Dad?

1210
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:58,985
All right.

1211
01:01:00,723 --> 01:01:02,122
Here we go.

1212
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:05,993
A club soda.

1213
01:01:10,733 --> 01:01:13,463
Well, we've got to work
on your technique here.

1214
01:01:14,637 --> 01:01:16,264
That's all right.

1215
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:21,802
A little home-cooked meal,
that's what you need.

1216
01:01:23,379 --> 01:01:25,370
Remember how you
used to tell me

1217
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,540
that all
the great chefs were men?

1218
01:01:28,084 --> 01:01:29,642
Well, I think
you're right.

1219
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:31,311
Wait till you
taste this.

1220
01:01:33,222 --> 01:01:34,689
Come on, Dad.

1221
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:37,592
All right.

1222
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:40,791
What's that?
Too big, you say?

1223
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:42,225
Hmm, all right.

1224
01:01:42,732 --> 01:01:44,324
Here. Try this.

1225
01:01:46,903 --> 01:01:48,962
Come on, Dad,
take a bite.

1226
01:01:49,572 --> 01:01:51,767
Come on,
there you go.

1227
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:54,699
All right!
We have a sale here.

1228
01:01:55,478 --> 01:01:57,776
Well.
Let's push our luck.

1229
01:01:59,015 --> 01:02:01,415
Here. Wash it down
with this, Dad.

1230
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:06,789
Dad, don't bite the glassware.
House rules.

1231
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:13,226
You just didn't like
that place, did you?

1232
01:02:13,596 --> 01:02:15,086
Neither did I.

1233
01:02:16,966 --> 01:02:18,991
Here you go. One more bite.

1234
01:02:21,704 --> 01:02:24,070
There you go, Dad.
All right!

1235
01:02:26,709 --> 01:02:28,643
We're going
to be okay, huh.

1236
01:02:29,879 --> 01:02:32,177
Here you go, Pop.
That's better.

1237
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:36,076
All right, Dad.

1238
01:02:36,385 --> 01:02:37,852
Hang on a second here

1239
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,150
and I'll have you
all settled in.

1240
01:02:42,558 --> 01:02:44,685
Let me grab these
and I'll be right back.

1241
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:46,092
Why are we here, Ed?

1242
01:02:46,162 --> 01:02:47,424
Why aren't we
at the farm?

1243
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:48,486
What?

1244
01:02:48,564 --> 01:02:51,260
You know they'll be
mad at us if we stay,

1245
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:52,323
you know that.

1246
01:02:52,735 --> 01:02:54,999
Where's
the owner of the house?

1247
01:02:55,471 --> 01:02:58,201
This is your house, Dad.
What are you talking about?

1248
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:00,504
Mandy is out of
the pasture again, Ed.

1249
01:03:00,576 --> 01:03:02,441
I'm worried about her.

1250
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:08,513
Well, don't worry, Dad.
I'm-I'm sure she's okay.

1251
01:03:08,584 --> 01:03:09,881
You think so?

1252
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:11,884
I do.

1253
01:03:12,555 --> 01:03:15,547
Hand me that 18 wrench there,
by the chicken wire.

1254
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:39,038
That ought to hold it now.

1255
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:41,910
Look.

1256
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:57,925
A good night's sleep
is what we need here, Dad.

1257
01:03:58,367 --> 01:04:00,130
Isn't that's what
you always used to say

1258
01:04:00,203 --> 01:04:01,830
when we had a problem?

1259
01:04:03,306 --> 01:04:05,069
"Let's sleep on it. "

1260
01:04:08,444 --> 01:04:11,072
Well, we got
ourselves a problem here, Dad.

1261
01:04:11,147 --> 01:04:12,808
Let's sleep on it.

1262
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:04,726
Dad?

1263
01:05:09,805 --> 01:05:10,794
Dad?

1264
01:05:13,609 --> 01:05:14,598
Dad?

1265
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:21,345
Dad, where are you?

1266
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:24,575
Dad?

1267
01:05:41,904 --> 01:05:42,893
Dad?

1268
01:05:48,911 --> 01:05:49,900
Dad?

1269
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:09,453
Dad?

1270
01:06:10,366 --> 01:06:11,799
What the hell
are you doing?

1271
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:14,464
Oh, Dad, here,
let me help you.

1272
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:19,168
All right, all right.
It's okay.

1273
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:21,333
Come here, Pop,
come here.

1274
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:22,399
No.

1275
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,411
Ouch! Ow!

1276
01:06:28,017 --> 01:06:30,383
Dad,
I'm gonna lift the bed.

1277
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:33,352
Crawl out.

1278
01:06:35,257 --> 01:06:37,248
Come on, Dad, crawl out.

1279
01:06:37,693 --> 01:06:39,251
Dad, come on.

1280
01:07:02,084 --> 01:07:05,383
Okay, now. I've got you.

1281
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:09,055
Shh.

1282
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:12,488
Come on.

1283
01:07:15,731 --> 01:07:16,925
Shh.

1284
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:20,700
I got you, Dad.
It's all right. It's okay.

1285
01:07:23,773 --> 01:07:26,037
Shh. I got you, I got you.

1286
01:07:26,108 --> 01:07:27,097
I got you.

1287
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:37,485
Mr. Tremont?

1288
01:07:38,687 --> 01:07:40,416
I understand you
put your father back

1289
01:07:40,489 --> 01:07:42,423
in the hospital.
I'm very sorry.

1290
01:07:42,491 --> 01:07:43,480
Yeah.

1291
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:45,453
I thought it might
be difficult for you

1292
01:07:45,528 --> 01:07:46,927
to care for him
at home.

1293
01:07:46,996 --> 01:07:49,021
It's really not the place
for him right now.

1294
01:07:49,098 --> 01:07:51,965
Well, he can't be at home
and he can't be here, right?

1295
01:07:52,034 --> 01:07:55,526
Maybe he can just hover
overhead in a helicopter.

1296
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:58,263
It's very hard,
I realize

1297
01:07:58,340 --> 01:08:00,570
for children
to understand

1298
01:08:00,643 --> 01:08:02,474
that their parents
have gotten old.

1299
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:05,338
To know what
that really means.

1300
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:07,882
I know what that means,
to be old. It means

1301
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:10,646
most people would
rather you were dead.

1302
01:08:10,853 --> 01:08:14,152
Mr. Tremont, you have to understand
that doctors are only human, too.

1303
01:08:14,223 --> 01:08:15,520
We can't solve every problem.

1304
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:17,684
We can't save every patient.

1305
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:21,555
We work in a system where
old people tend to sometimes

1306
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:22,961
fall through the cracks.

1307
01:08:23,032 --> 01:08:24,863
What is it you want?

1308
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:26,762
Why are you here?

1309
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:29,665
There's another doctor
here at the hospital.

1310
01:08:29,738 --> 01:08:32,571
I think he might be
better than Dr. Santana.

1311
01:08:32,641 --> 01:08:33,767
What?

1312
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,907
I'll deny ever
having said that.

1313
01:08:35,978 --> 01:08:37,502
He's a fine man.

1314
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,304
I'd like to see
if I can get him

1315
01:08:39,381 --> 01:08:41,042
to take a look
at your father.

1316
01:08:43,352 --> 01:08:44,751
Mr. Tremont?

1317
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:47,320
Mr. Tremont?

1318
01:08:49,325 --> 01:08:51,316
How are you,
Mr. Tremont?

1319
01:08:52,695 --> 01:08:54,890
Let's get a few more studies.

1320
01:08:55,397 --> 01:08:59,390
Please order an EEG and let's look
for any metabolic abnormalities.

1321
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:02,995
Order calcium-magnesium
and liver function tests.

1322
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:09,840
I'm not sure
exactly what caused it,

1323
01:09:09,912 --> 01:09:11,709
but right now,
I'm inclined to go along

1324
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:13,509
with the diagnosis
of a seizure.

1325
01:09:13,582 --> 01:09:15,914
The question is,
what caused it?

1326
01:09:16,218 --> 01:09:18,311
And why is he still comatose?

1327
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:21,117
If you want to have
another consultation on this,

1328
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:22,657
please do so.

1329
01:09:26,128 --> 01:09:27,755
No, that
won't be necessary.

1330
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,024
Well, having said that

1331
01:09:29,098 --> 01:09:30,998
don't get the impression
that we're going to

1332
01:09:31,066 --> 01:09:32,556
sit by and do nothing.

1333
01:09:32,635 --> 01:09:33,829
We won't.

1334
01:09:33,903 --> 01:09:36,167
We've just done a series
of tests and we'll do more.

1335
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:38,729
It's just that right now, we're
really shooting in the dark.

1336
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:40,866
We really appreciate
your honesty, Doctor.

1337
01:09:40,943 --> 01:09:42,843
It's strange. You know,
the LP we did

1338
01:09:42,912 --> 01:09:45,881
showed up an elevated protein
in the spinal fluid,

1339
01:09:45,948 --> 01:09:48,473
but the CAT scan showed
no evidence of

1340
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:49,813
a stroke or tumor.

1341
01:09:49,885 --> 01:09:51,216
Those tests
should have been done

1342
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:52,879
a long time ago,
shouldn't they?

1343
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:54,722
We'll keep him in ICU,

1344
01:09:54,790 --> 01:09:56,587
that way he'll be
monitored at all times.

1345
01:09:56,659 --> 01:09:59,287
And I'll check in
and see him twice a day.

1346
01:09:59,929 --> 01:10:02,557
I'm going to move in here
with him, then, if it's okay.

1347
01:10:02,631 --> 01:10:04,895
I'm afraid, that's entirely
against hospital regulations.

1348
01:10:04,967 --> 01:10:07,197
Well, if it makes you
feel more comfortable,

1349
01:10:07,269 --> 01:10:08,827
I think
it's a good idea.

1350
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:25,171
How long do you think
you can keep this up?

1351
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:27,066
I don't know.

1352
01:12:27,142 --> 01:12:29,474
I'm just goin'
one day at a time.

1353
01:12:30,946 --> 01:12:32,277
I sit.

1354
01:12:33,215 --> 01:12:34,705
I talk to him.

1355
01:12:35,217 --> 01:12:38,311
I talk to myself.
I talk to people passing by.

1356
01:12:38,921 --> 01:12:41,685
I have this idea
if I'm sitting there

1357
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:44,120
and I'm talking,
he won't die.

1358
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:47,719
What are you going
to do when he does?

1359
01:12:48,997 --> 01:12:50,089
Annie, I don't-

1360
01:12:50,165 --> 01:12:53,134
You're the only one
who hasn't accepted it, John.

1361
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:57,862
Why can't you let him go?

1362
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:59,803
I can't explain it.

1363
01:13:01,443 --> 01:13:04,241
Maybe I want to be there
to mark the end.

1364
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:06,937
I don't know.

1365
01:13:08,083 --> 01:13:09,573
To prove he was here.

1366
01:13:09,718 --> 01:13:11,242
To prove I was his son.

1367
01:13:11,954 --> 01:13:14,286
What more could you
possibly have done?

1368
01:13:14,356 --> 01:13:17,655
Annie, that man got up
every day of his life

1369
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:19,789
and went to
a job he didn't like.

1370
01:13:19,928 --> 01:13:21,691
We didn't ask him to.

1371
01:13:22,598 --> 01:13:24,691
He just did it
because he was the father

1372
01:13:24,767 --> 01:13:26,598
and that was
the deal he made.

1373
01:13:26,668 --> 01:13:30,468
He didn't ask himself
if he was satisfied or happy.

1374
01:13:31,006 --> 01:13:33,531
He didn't even
know he had the right.

1375
01:13:33,842 --> 01:13:36,242
Somehow part of
that deal was that

1376
01:13:36,645 --> 01:13:38,510
we'd care for him
and watch over him

1377
01:13:38,614 --> 01:13:40,275
when he got older.

1378
01:13:42,284 --> 01:13:43,945
I screwed that up.

1379
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:45,308
John.

1380
01:13:45,521 --> 01:13:47,614
I got embarrassed by him,

1381
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:50,654
by the way Mom dominated him.

1382
01:13:51,627 --> 01:13:53,527
By the way he got old.

1383
01:13:54,897 --> 01:13:58,333
Embarrassed that
I had a marriage that failed,

1384
01:13:59,501 --> 01:14:01,628
a job that didn't make sense,

1385
01:14:01,703 --> 01:14:03,694
a son I'd barely recognize

1386
01:14:03,772 --> 01:14:05,672
if I passed him
on the street.

1387
01:14:06,241 --> 01:14:09,039
Maybe this is more
for me than for him,

1388
01:14:12,147 --> 01:14:14,707
but I'm gonna be there
when he dies.

1389
01:14:16,018 --> 01:14:18,043
And I'm gonna kiss him,

1390
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:21,746
and I'm going to cover him,

1391
01:14:23,325 --> 01:14:25,555
and I'm gonna
mark the moment.

1392
01:14:29,097 --> 01:14:30,655
I owe him that.

1393
01:14:53,755 --> 01:14:56,019
When did you
get back in town?

1394
01:14:56,992 --> 01:14:59,517
I never left.
I'm staying with some friends.

1395
01:14:59,595 --> 01:15:01,688
I didn't want
to leave Grandpa.

1396
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:04,298
You've been
coming here every day?

1397
01:15:04,933 --> 01:15:07,333
Whenever you leave,
one of the nurses calls me.

1398
01:15:07,402 --> 01:15:10,064
I usually stay
a half-an-hour or so.

1399
01:15:10,772 --> 01:15:13,138
I guess I dozed off. Sorry.

1400
01:16:03,325 --> 01:16:05,122
Where am I, Johnny?

1401
01:16:06,128 --> 01:16:07,755
You're in a hospital,
Dad.

1402
01:16:07,829 --> 01:16:10,161
I think I could
have guessed that one.

1403
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:11,961
Why are you here?

1404
01:16:12,034 --> 01:16:14,764
Was there an earthquake
or a car crash or something?

1405
01:16:15,804 --> 01:16:16,896
He speaks?

1406
01:16:16,972 --> 01:16:18,405
Yes, he does.

1407
01:16:18,473 --> 01:16:20,464
It's something he
learned as a child.

1408
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:23,033
Go, uh, go page Dr. Chad
right away.

1409
01:16:23,111 --> 01:16:24,840
Please, please.

1410
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:27,414
Why was she
looking at me funny?

1411
01:16:27,482 --> 01:16:29,507
Uh, she's-she's part of
the hospital, Dad.

1412
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:31,177
She's, uh, a nurse.

1413
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:33,346
She's, uh... As a matter of
fact, these are all nurses.

1414
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:36,653
This is Molly, this is
J.J., uh, this is Annie.

1415
01:16:37,526 --> 01:16:39,050
This is my dad.

1416
01:16:56,411 --> 01:16:57,776
Well, Mr. Tremont.

1417
01:16:57,846 --> 01:16:59,677
What can we do to
make you comfortable?

1418
01:16:59,748 --> 01:17:03,741
Well, to start with, you could
take out these pipes and wires.

1419
01:17:03,919 --> 01:17:06,217
Then maybe I could
have something to eat.

1420
01:17:06,288 --> 01:17:08,518
I feel like you've
been starving me here.

1421
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:11,525
Okay, but we'll have to
start you off very slowly.

1422
01:17:11,593 --> 01:17:13,686
Don't forget you really
haven't eaten anything

1423
01:17:13,762 --> 01:17:15,627
in quite a long time.

1424
01:17:15,831 --> 01:17:17,594
Maybe that was what
was wrong with me.

1425
01:17:17,666 --> 01:17:19,361
Have you
thought of that?

1426
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:26,672
All the tests are positive,
the vital signs stable.

1427
01:17:26,742 --> 01:17:28,403
This is the profile
of a healthy man.

1428
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:29,842
What happened?
What's goin' on?

1429
01:17:29,911 --> 01:17:32,607
I've seen people recover
from comas before.

1430
01:17:32,681 --> 01:17:35,275
Very often we
never find out why.

1431
01:17:36,051 --> 01:17:38,747
I have some theories
in this case.

1432
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:41,787
Nothing that I'd
want to see published.

1433
01:17:41,857 --> 01:17:43,222
Like what?

1434
01:17:43,925 --> 01:17:45,517
It is entirely possible

1435
01:17:45,594 --> 01:17:47,255
that he was so fearful
of the cancer

1436
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:48,921
that his brain froze up,

1437
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:50,828
stopped producing
a vital chemical

1438
01:17:50,899 --> 01:17:52,764
or enzyme that he needed.

1439
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:55,894
Somehow with that last
variation of the IV mixture

1440
01:17:55,971 --> 01:17:58,804
we got lucky
and he replaced that enzyme.

1441
01:17:59,241 --> 01:18:00,401
I see.

1442
01:18:02,144 --> 01:18:04,112
You know,
if we were back home,

1443
01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:05,840
we'd say that it was
not that at all.

1444
01:18:05,914 --> 01:18:08,849
But rather,
it was your love and caring

1445
01:18:08,917 --> 01:18:12,114
that called your father back
from where he'd gone.

1446
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:14,489
I think that I like
that one better.

1447
01:18:14,556 --> 01:18:15,818
Me, too.

1448
01:18:17,392 --> 01:18:18,916
Here they are.

1449
01:19:21,323 --> 01:19:22,585
What's goin' on, Dad?

1450
01:19:22,657 --> 01:19:23,885
What are you looking for?

1451
01:19:23,959 --> 01:19:25,256
Your mother and I

1452
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:27,089
are starting
a new life together, Johnny.

1453
01:19:27,162 --> 01:19:29,187
We need
some new clothes.

1454
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:33,890
Hey, nice day. How you doing?

1455
01:19:34,536 --> 01:19:36,128
I don't know, Dad.

1456
01:19:36,204 --> 01:19:38,900
What do you suppose
Mom will say about all this?

1457
01:19:38,974 --> 01:19:42,671
She'll probably laugh and call
me crazy, but she'll laugh.

1458
01:19:43,378 --> 01:19:45,312
We haven't had
enough laughter in our house

1459
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:47,245
for the past 10 years.

1460
01:19:53,188 --> 01:19:54,917
What do you think of that?

1461
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:58,149
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you.

1462
01:19:58,226 --> 01:20:00,751
Ladies, ladies,
the show is about to begin.

1463
01:20:00,829 --> 01:20:02,319
No matter how
stimulated you become

1464
01:20:02,397 --> 01:20:03,625
during the performance,

1465
01:20:03,698 --> 01:20:06,166
please remain in your seats
at all times.

1466
01:20:08,403 --> 01:20:12,499
The house is proud to present
the star of our show,

1467
01:20:12,574 --> 01:20:15,975
the late sick man
and almost corpus delicti,

1468
01:20:16,044 --> 01:20:19,013
back from a successful tour
of the Caribbean,

1469
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:21,043
Gorgeous Jake.

1470
01:20:21,149 --> 01:20:22,480
Give him a big hand.

1471
01:20:22,584 --> 01:20:24,484
Come on, give him a big hand.

1472
01:20:25,987 --> 01:20:26,976
Here we go.

1473
01:20:27,055 --> 01:20:30,684
Also his faithful companion,
Billy!

1474
01:20:30,759 --> 01:20:32,852
Ladies and gentlemen, Billy!

1475
01:20:33,195 --> 01:20:35,425
What is this? What's it for?

1476
01:20:35,497 --> 01:20:39,228
This is my outfit
for bicycling in Venice

1477
01:20:39,301 --> 01:20:40,734
down on the beach.

1478
01:20:40,802 --> 01:20:42,770
And maybe roller skating.

1479
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:46,001
And this? This is my
baseball-watching outfit.

1480
01:20:46,074 --> 01:20:47,200
See?

1481
01:20:47,275 --> 01:20:49,505
I think I'll wear it mostly
only in the house.

1482
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:51,705
Actually, I'm going
to go see a few of the games,

1483
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:52,974
but not in my outfit.

1484
01:20:53,048 --> 01:20:54,777
That's good to hear, Jake.

1485
01:20:55,217 --> 01:20:56,946
Wait. There's more.

1486
01:21:13,001 --> 01:21:14,901
Let me see that again.

1487
01:21:27,315 --> 01:21:29,112
Oh, I'll piss
my pants!

1488
01:21:34,456 --> 01:21:37,983
Tell them to stop.
I'm dying!

1489
01:21:38,293 --> 01:21:42,024
I never heard of anybody
dying from laughing, Bette.

1490
01:21:42,931 --> 01:21:44,956
But wouldn't that be nice?

1491
01:21:53,541 --> 01:21:56,203
I tell you, Johnny,
he's not the same.

1492
01:21:56,344 --> 01:21:59,643
Maybe his hormones got
mixed up with someone else's.

1493
01:21:59,848 --> 01:22:02,681
You know what goes
on in these hospitals.

1494
01:22:07,322 --> 01:22:09,688
Nobody would
believe he's a 78-year-old man

1495
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:11,316
who almost
died a few weeks ago.

1496
01:22:11,393 --> 01:22:13,623
You've got to talk with
somebody, I'm serious.

1497
01:22:13,695 --> 01:22:15,754
Mom,
he's just having fun.

1498
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:20,259
Not bad.
I shot a 94.

1499
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:23,496
It's a one-hole course,
but still...

1500
01:22:23,571 --> 01:22:25,368
It's a wonderful day.

1501
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:27,635
How about I take us
for a drive after breakfast?

1502
01:22:27,709 --> 01:22:29,006
Ah, it's
a good idea.

1503
01:22:29,077 --> 01:22:30,544
Maybe Mom will
come along with us.

1504
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:32,307
I'm not going to
drive with him.

1505
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:34,211
He drove too fast before.

1506
01:22:34,349 --> 01:22:36,214
I hate to think
what he'd be like now.

1507
01:22:36,284 --> 01:22:38,684
Don't you worry your
pretty little head, Bette.

1508
01:22:38,753 --> 01:22:41,119
With old Jake Tremont
behind that wheel,

1509
01:22:41,189 --> 01:22:43,817
you're as safe as if
you were in your own bed.

1510
01:22:43,892 --> 01:22:45,985
And it's almost as much fun.

1511
01:23:00,275 --> 01:23:02,243
What on Earth are
you looking for?

1512
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:05,677
Nothing. I want to see
if I can still do a pushup.

1513
01:23:17,859 --> 01:23:20,419
I'll call these
"old man pushups. "

1514
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:26,997
What about it, Bette?

1515
01:23:27,202 --> 01:23:29,227
You want to hit the beach?

1516
01:23:29,704 --> 01:23:32,502
I'll go,
but only in a taxicab.

1517
01:23:36,244 --> 01:23:38,371
I don't want to go in a cab.

1518
01:23:40,982 --> 01:23:43,610
We'd probably wind
up in Santa Monica.

1519
01:23:44,419 --> 01:23:48,048
That town is
an outside old people's home.

1520
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:51,553
On every corner,
a doctor's office or a bank.

1521
01:23:51,993 --> 01:23:53,858
I'd like to drive to Venice.

1522
01:23:53,928 --> 01:23:56,089
Maybe to the pier.
Get in a little fishin'.

1523
01:23:56,798 --> 01:23:59,096
Oh, I used to like fishin'.

1524
01:24:02,504 --> 01:24:04,529
Where's all my fishing gear?

1525
01:24:04,606 --> 01:24:07,131
I think I put it away
in the garage.

1526
01:24:09,944 --> 01:24:11,707
About 35 years ago.

1527
01:24:11,913 --> 01:24:13,312
I'll get it.

1528
01:24:17,485 --> 01:24:19,453
Well, whatever's
going on with Dad,

1529
01:24:19,521 --> 01:24:20,988
I think
it's pretty terrific.

1530
01:24:22,490 --> 01:24:24,788
Oh, come on.
It's going to be okay.

1531
01:24:25,393 --> 01:24:27,122
Johnny, I'm scared.

1532
01:24:27,462 --> 01:24:29,930
He's talking about
people I don't even know,

1533
01:24:29,998 --> 01:24:32,159
or people
I'm sure are dead.

1534
01:24:32,233 --> 01:24:35,760
He says we live on a farm
in Cape May, New Jersey

1535
01:24:35,837 --> 01:24:37,668
and he wants us
all to go back there

1536
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:39,764
because it's
harvest time.

1537
01:24:40,475 --> 01:24:41,601
What?

1538
01:24:56,991 --> 01:24:58,083
Dad.

1539
01:25:04,666 --> 01:25:06,156
She told you, huh.

1540
01:25:06,234 --> 01:25:08,429
Yeah.
What's goin' on?

1541
01:25:10,572 --> 01:25:12,301
Take me for a ride.

1542
01:25:12,607 --> 01:25:14,131
John, I need to talk.

1543
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:32,849
Johnny,

1544
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:37,598
what chance is there

1545
01:25:37,665 --> 01:25:39,997
that Mother and I
have four kids

1546
01:25:40,168 --> 01:25:43,194
and we live on a farm
in Cape May, New Jersey?

1547
01:25:45,306 --> 01:25:48,070
I don't think
there's much chance, Dad.

1548
01:25:50,745 --> 01:25:53,441
No chance that I have
a little fa-farm there?

1549
01:25:54,215 --> 01:25:55,682
Right next to

1550
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:57,684
Bill Sullivan
and Ira Taylor

1551
01:25:58,486 --> 01:26:01,387
across from my brother Ed
and Gene Michaels?

1552
01:26:03,791 --> 01:26:05,952
I don't have
four kids there?

1553
01:26:06,227 --> 01:26:09,128
You and Annie and
Hank and little Lizbeth?

1554
01:26:11,099 --> 01:26:12,964
As far as I know, Dad,

1555
01:26:13,067 --> 01:26:15,661
you've been living
here in LA about 25 years.

1556
01:26:16,938 --> 01:26:20,135
Held a regular job
at Lockheed till you retired.

1557
01:26:20,208 --> 01:26:21,903
Before that,
we lived in Plainfield

1558
01:26:21,976 --> 01:26:23,637
and you worked
for Lockheed there.

1559
01:26:23,711 --> 01:26:25,736
I know
you must be right.

1560
01:26:26,814 --> 01:26:29,408
I mean, how can you be
in two places at once?

1561
01:26:31,886 --> 01:26:33,820
I've got to tell you,

1562
01:26:33,888 --> 01:26:36,755
my life there is as real
to me as we are here,

1563
01:26:38,359 --> 01:26:40,987
just sitting and
looking at the ocean.

1564
01:26:46,467 --> 01:26:48,526
Stop me if this
gets too technical

1565
01:26:48,603 --> 01:26:50,400
or too fantastic.

1566
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:55,005
Your father is
what Laing would call

1567
01:26:55,076 --> 01:26:57,203
a successful schizophrenic.

1568
01:26:57,812 --> 01:26:59,939
Over the years,
he hasn't been getting

1569
01:27:00,014 --> 01:27:01,777
enough pleasure
out of his daily life,

1570
01:27:01,849 --> 01:27:04,147
so he's isolated
his greatest joys

1571
01:27:04,285 --> 01:27:05,946
into a dream.

1572
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:07,885
He's created
a personal experience

1573
01:27:07,956 --> 01:27:10,550
more to his liking.
An alternate coping system.

1574
01:27:11,092 --> 01:27:12,559
How long has
this been going on?

1575
01:27:12,627 --> 01:27:13,616
Hard to say yet.

1576
01:27:13,695 --> 01:27:15,822
At least 20 years,
maybe more.

1577
01:27:18,199 --> 01:27:19,223
Incredible.

1578
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:21,495
You realize, it takes
an extremely intelligent,

1579
01:27:21,569 --> 01:27:24,163
strong-willed,
and imaginative individual

1580
01:27:24,272 --> 01:27:25,671
to do this successfully.

1581
01:27:26,741 --> 01:27:28,208
Where is my mother
in all this?

1582
01:27:28,276 --> 01:27:29,709
Is she just shut out?

1583
01:27:29,777 --> 01:27:33,372
No, she's there.
She's younger. You all are.

1584
01:27:33,881 --> 01:27:35,746
You're frozen in time.

1585
01:27:35,950 --> 01:27:39,511
She's very supportive,
very sweet.

1586
01:27:40,722 --> 01:27:42,986
I take it that's not
always the case here

1587
01:27:43,057 --> 01:27:44,251
in this world?

1588
01:27:44,759 --> 01:27:46,556
She has her moments.

1589
01:27:49,564 --> 01:27:51,498
The problem is

1590
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:54,728
your father's participation
in this world

1591
01:27:54,802 --> 01:27:57,703
is totally tied up
with your mother's approval.

1592
01:27:57,772 --> 01:27:59,865
Since his recovery,
he's been a happy person.

1593
01:27:59,941 --> 01:28:03,172
The walls dividing his two
worlds have broken down.

1594
01:28:03,311 --> 01:28:06,246
And he's bringing
into his everyday life

1595
01:28:06,447 --> 01:28:07,971
the joy In living

1596
01:28:08,049 --> 01:28:09,983
he's kept separate
all these years.

1597
01:28:10,918 --> 01:28:14,786
If your mother doesn't
go along with him here,

1598
01:28:16,357 --> 01:28:17,824
he'll just fade away again.

1599
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:21,960
Hello, all you
beautiful people.

1600
01:28:23,231 --> 01:28:26,029
Oh, it's a wonderful day.
Let's go to the beach.

1601
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:28,796
Maybe I can do some jogging
on the bike path.

1602
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:31,236
What will people think
if they see you like this?

1603
01:28:31,306 --> 01:28:32,637
Who cares?

1604
01:28:34,042 --> 01:28:36,033
We got to get
over the feeling

1605
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:37,543
that we're old fogies.

1606
01:28:37,612 --> 01:28:40,638
And also stop worrying
at what people think.

1607
01:28:42,650 --> 01:28:44,481
You sure as hell
don't see any of

1608
01:28:44,552 --> 01:28:46,713
the young people
asking us what to wear.

1609
01:28:46,788 --> 01:28:48,085
I'll go with you, Dad.

1610
01:28:48,156 --> 01:28:49,646
Good boy, good boy.

1611
01:28:50,558 --> 01:28:51,855
Don't worry about me.

1612
01:28:51,926 --> 01:28:53,359
I'll run over to Newark,

1613
01:28:53,428 --> 01:28:55,419
pick up some things
for the farm.

1614
01:28:57,031 --> 01:29:00,159
Hey, Ma, Ma, I told you
what the doctor said.

1615
01:29:00,234 --> 01:29:02,327
It's very important that you
support him right now.

1616
01:29:02,403 --> 01:29:04,496
Making that kind of remark
won't help anything.

1617
01:29:04,572 --> 01:29:06,631
The man is living
in another time zone.

1618
01:29:06,708 --> 01:29:08,733
I think it should be pointed
out to him. That's all.

1619
01:29:08,810 --> 01:29:10,710
I've explained,
this is just a dream.

1620
01:29:10,778 --> 01:29:13,303
A very well-defined
and lovely dream world.

1621
01:29:13,381 --> 01:29:15,406
Dad's learning how to
separate the two right now.

1622
01:29:15,483 --> 01:29:16,472
He's trying.

1623
01:29:16,551 --> 01:29:18,382
I don't care what you say.
It's not normal.

1624
01:29:18,453 --> 01:29:19,647
Something has
happened to him.

1625
01:29:19,721 --> 01:29:21,382
This man is not your father.

1626
01:29:21,456 --> 01:29:23,720
I think this is
the real Jake Tremont.

1627
01:29:23,791 --> 01:29:26,259
He's just been
hiding for 50 years.

1628
01:29:28,196 --> 01:29:30,355
Hello.

1629
01:29:30,431 --> 01:29:32,365
I'm Jake Tremont,
this is Bette Tremont.

1630
01:29:32,433 --> 01:29:34,424
We're your neighbors
across the street.

1631
01:29:34,502 --> 01:29:35,867
Of course.

1632
01:29:36,938 --> 01:29:38,428
Can I help you
with something?

1633
01:29:38,506 --> 01:29:41,270
No. No, no, no, just wanted
to introduce ourselves

1634
01:29:41,342 --> 01:29:42,604
and say howdy.

1635
01:29:42,677 --> 01:29:43,701
Well.

1636
01:29:43,778 --> 01:29:45,143
This is Christopher.

1637
01:29:45,213 --> 01:29:47,204
What do you say there,
young guy?

1638
01:29:49,717 --> 01:29:51,810
Say hi to Mr.
and Mrs. Tremont, Chris.

1639
01:29:51,886 --> 01:29:53,979
Hi.
Hi.

1640
01:29:54,288 --> 01:29:56,017
We're home all the time

1641
01:29:56,090 --> 01:29:57,648
if you ever need
anyone to baby-sit.

1642
01:29:57,725 --> 01:29:59,716
Oh, how nice.
Thank you.

1643
01:30:03,030 --> 01:30:05,021
No, no, no,
that's a lying dog.

1644
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:09,030
That one. That's a good
example of a lying dog.

1645
01:30:09,270 --> 01:30:10,567
That's-that's Speedy.

1646
01:30:10,638 --> 01:30:11,605
Yes.

1647
01:30:11,806 --> 01:30:13,865
Yeah, He's-he is fast.

1648
01:30:13,941 --> 01:30:15,670
Look at that.
Look at him race.

1649
01:30:16,310 --> 01:30:18,107
Let's...
Maybe if we put-

1650
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:21,144
Well, hi there.
We're Jake and Bette T remont

1651
01:30:21,215 --> 01:30:22,409
from up the street.

1652
01:30:22,483 --> 01:30:23,643
Wanted to say hello.

1653
01:30:23,718 --> 01:30:24,810
Brought you
a little cake.

1654
01:30:24,886 --> 01:30:26,183
Come on in.

1655
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:27,617
Oh, thank you.
Go ahead, Bette.

1656
01:30:33,461 --> 01:30:35,986
Good morning, Mother.
Where's Dad?

1657
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:39,165
I don't know.
Probably out pole-vaulting.

1658
01:30:40,001 --> 01:30:42,469
Did you hear any
strange noises last night?

1659
01:30:42,537 --> 01:30:44,300
No.
Why, did you?

1660
01:30:44,372 --> 01:30:45,862
I thought
I heard something.

1661
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:47,407
Must've been
the wind.

1662
01:30:47,475 --> 01:30:49,204
Close the door

1663
01:30:49,277 --> 01:30:51,142
They're comin'
in the window

1664
01:30:51,212 --> 01:30:52,736
So how's it going
with Dad?

1665
01:30:52,814 --> 01:30:54,975
The doctor thinks he's
making a lot of progress.

1666
01:30:55,049 --> 01:30:56,846
He keeps coming
into my bed at night.

1667
01:30:56,918 --> 01:30:58,442
He won't leave me alone.

1668
01:30:58,519 --> 01:31:01,010
Your father's always been
a highly sexed man,

1669
01:31:01,088 --> 01:31:03,989
but since he came back
from New Jersey, it's insane.

1670
01:31:04,058 --> 01:31:05,491
When we first got married

1671
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:08,393
and I told my friend Fanny
Hogan the things we were doing,

1672
01:31:08,463 --> 01:31:11,432
she told me to leave him
and notify the police.

1673
01:31:11,499 --> 01:31:13,091
I told the priest
in confession,

1674
01:31:13,167 --> 01:31:14,998
he said
he'd pray for me.

1675
01:31:15,069 --> 01:31:16,559
Fat lot of good
that did.

1676
01:31:16,637 --> 01:31:18,366
You know, when your father
gets excited,

1677
01:31:18,439 --> 01:31:21,897
police, priests, prayers,
nothing is gonna stop him.

1678
01:31:23,578 --> 01:31:24,977
Oh, grow up.

1679
01:31:25,780 --> 01:31:30,149
I'm a little teapot
Short and stout

1680
01:31:30,518 --> 01:31:34,921
Here is my handle
Here is my spout

1681
01:31:35,556 --> 01:31:38,024
When I get all steamed up

1682
01:31:38,092 --> 01:31:40,026
Hear me shout

1683
01:31:40,561 --> 01:31:44,156
"Tip me over
and pour me out!"

1684
01:31:46,734 --> 01:31:48,031
Oh, bingo.

1685
01:31:48,669 --> 01:31:49,658
There.

1686
01:31:55,276 --> 01:31:57,005
You know, I just
realized something.

1687
01:31:57,144 --> 01:31:58,873
We don't speak
Japanese.

1688
01:31:58,946 --> 01:32:00,675
You just
realized that.

1689
01:32:00,748 --> 01:32:02,716
We should have
one night a week

1690
01:32:02,850 --> 01:32:04,841
where we try to learn
about a new country.

1691
01:32:04,919 --> 01:32:07,217
We should eat food
only from that country

1692
01:32:07,355 --> 01:32:09,653
and speak that
country's language.

1693
01:32:09,724 --> 01:32:10,952
We should
do that.

1694
01:32:11,025 --> 01:32:12,253
No, we shouldn't.

1695
01:32:16,864 --> 01:32:19,628
"Where is the train station?"

1696
01:32:22,203 --> 01:32:24,103
"Where is the train station?"

1697
01:32:24,372 --> 01:32:25,600
What are you doing?

1698
01:32:25,673 --> 01:32:27,937
I'm trying to find
the train station.

1699
01:32:30,678 --> 01:32:33,545
I think this is good.
This is working.

1700
01:32:33,614 --> 01:32:35,912
I'm beginning to
feel very Japanese.

1701
01:32:35,983 --> 01:32:40,181
Oh, uh, yeah, Annie,
give us some facts, please.

1702
01:32:40,254 --> 01:32:41,846
Costumes, right?

1703
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:44,119
"The Japanese
costume for women

1704
01:32:44,191 --> 01:32:45,988
"is hardly different
from that of the men.

1705
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:48,392
"In many districts, the
peasant women wear trousers

1706
01:32:48,462 --> 01:32:49,952
"and raincoats
like their husbands.

1707
01:32:50,031 --> 01:32:52,226
"This, coupled with the
absence of beard in the men,

1708
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:54,427
"often makes it difficult
for a newcomer

1709
01:32:54,502 --> 01:32:56,402
to distinguish
between the sexes. "

1710
01:32:56,470 --> 01:32:57,664
I don't know about you guys,

1711
01:32:57,738 --> 01:32:59,228
but I'm very nervous
about a country

1712
01:32:59,307 --> 01:33:01,298
where you can't distinguish
between the sexes.

1713
01:33:01,375 --> 01:33:02,433
Mario.
I'm serious.

1714
01:33:02,510 --> 01:33:03,909
That happened to
me in a bar once.

1715
01:33:05,146 --> 01:33:09,276
John, John, you tell us
about, uh, agriculture.

1716
01:33:09,517 --> 01:33:11,417
All right.
"In this land of mountains,

1717
01:33:11,485 --> 01:33:14,921
barely 12% of the entire
surface can be cultivated. "

1718
01:33:14,989 --> 01:33:16,320
Pass the rice, please.

1719
01:33:16,390 --> 01:33:19,052
Only if you
ask in Japanese.

1720
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:24,993
"Pass the rice,
please. "

1721
01:33:29,303 --> 01:33:30,600
You're welcome.

1722
01:33:30,671 --> 01:33:32,434
Come on, Mom.
Get in the spirit.

1723
01:33:32,506 --> 01:33:33,632
No.

1724
01:33:34,775 --> 01:33:35,867
No.

1725
01:33:36,043 --> 01:33:37,067
No.

1726
01:33:37,144 --> 01:33:39,612
Billy, you-you go ahead.

1727
01:33:40,481 --> 01:33:42,847
Traditional Japanese sports.

1728
01:33:42,917 --> 01:33:44,316
What do you have for us?

1729
01:33:44,385 --> 01:33:48,048
"The sumo wrestler must reach
the weight of 300 pounds

1730
01:33:48,122 --> 01:33:49,749
"before he is allowed to don

1731
01:33:49,824 --> 01:33:51,917
the traditional sumo
diaper and compete. "

1732
01:33:51,993 --> 01:33:53,085
That's a great idea.

1733
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:55,822
Get them as fat as you can,
then put a diaper on them.

1734
01:33:55,896 --> 01:33:57,761
John, you don't find
those guys attractive?

1735
01:33:57,832 --> 01:34:00,027
Mario, I'm starting to
worry about you.

1736
01:34:00,468 --> 01:34:02,436
Honey, would you
pass me the...

1737
01:34:02,503 --> 01:34:04,903
W- w-wait a minute.
Pass, pass...

1738
01:34:08,609 --> 01:34:10,577
What do you want?
The rice? Here.

1739
01:34:10,645 --> 01:34:12,010
What about the fish?

1740
01:34:12,079 --> 01:34:13,444
You want that, too?
Here.

1741
01:34:13,581 --> 01:34:16,414
What about the soy sauce?
And some tofu?

1742
01:34:16,484 --> 01:34:19,214
No, I can't take this,
Jake. I don't want this.

1743
01:34:19,286 --> 01:34:20,514
I don't want to
know Japanese.

1744
01:34:20,588 --> 01:34:22,647
And I don't want to know
the neighbors' children.

1745
01:34:22,723 --> 01:34:24,350
Mom, would you just... Stop.

1746
01:34:24,425 --> 01:34:26,552
I've had it.
I've tried so hard

1747
01:34:26,627 --> 01:34:28,458
to make it work,
and you know that I have.

1748
01:34:28,529 --> 01:34:29,962
But since he came
out of hospital,

1749
01:34:30,031 --> 01:34:31,658
it's been like a loony bin
around here.

1750
01:34:31,732 --> 01:34:33,700
Costumes and jogging
and sex at all hours.

1751
01:34:33,768 --> 01:34:35,736
And a make-believe
farm in New Jersey!

1752
01:34:35,803 --> 01:34:38,465
I'm telling you this man should
not be let loose in the street.

1753
01:34:38,539 --> 01:34:40,166
Dad is perfectly fine.

1754
01:34:40,241 --> 01:34:42,732
He's just trying
to enjoy himself!

1755
01:34:42,810 --> 01:34:45,802
I didn't live my life
to end up like this!

1756
01:34:46,247 --> 01:34:49,739
With a crazy person as a
companion in my old age!

1757
01:34:49,817 --> 01:34:51,182
You know
better than that.

1758
01:34:51,252 --> 01:34:52,776
The doctor said
Dad is not crazy!

1759
01:34:52,853 --> 01:34:53,820
As a matter of fact,

1760
01:34:53,888 --> 01:34:55,685
he's very impressed
he didn't go insane

1761
01:34:55,756 --> 01:34:58,224
just hanging around you
for 30 years!

1762
01:35:00,261 --> 01:35:01,523
Oh, don't.

1763
01:35:02,063 --> 01:35:03,792
Please don't.

1764
01:35:03,931 --> 01:35:05,660
Don't say those things
to your mother.

1765
01:35:06,267 --> 01:35:07,598
Please.

1766
01:35:09,837 --> 01:35:11,395
We're family.

1767
01:35:15,509 --> 01:35:17,409
That's all that counts.

1768
01:35:20,181 --> 01:35:23,048
Let's love each other
and forget.

1769
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:28,553
And please don't fight.

1770
01:35:33,127 --> 01:35:34,719
That kills me

1771
01:35:36,030 --> 01:35:38,464
when I hear you
talking that way.

1772
01:35:55,950 --> 01:35:57,008
Why?

1773
01:35:57,618 --> 01:35:59,381
Why are you
doing this?

1774
01:35:59,453 --> 01:36:01,648
You're just gonna
shove him back down again.

1775
01:36:01,722 --> 01:36:03,713
That can't be
what you want.

1776
01:36:04,225 --> 01:36:06,523
I want
my husband back.

1777
01:36:06,761 --> 01:36:08,820
He wants
his life back.

1778
01:36:08,896 --> 01:36:10,659
He's loved you
for 50 years.

1779
01:36:10,731 --> 01:36:13,222
Can't you let him
have what's left?

1780
01:36:50,337 --> 01:36:51,998
I'm scared, Jake.

1781
01:36:53,407 --> 01:36:55,602
I don't know
who you are anymore.

1782
01:36:55,676 --> 01:36:58,144
I don't
recognize you.

1783
01:37:00,881 --> 01:37:02,212
I know.

1784
01:37:03,818 --> 01:37:05,479
You look at me

1785
01:37:05,886 --> 01:37:09,686
or people look at me
and they see this old man.

1786
01:37:09,757 --> 01:37:13,750
But inside, honest to God,
Bette, I feel 19.

1787
01:37:15,362 --> 01:37:17,353
And act it, too,
I guess.

1788
01:37:22,036 --> 01:37:24,004
This other life, Jake,

1789
01:37:26,073 --> 01:37:27,370
it hurts.

1790
01:37:29,276 --> 01:37:31,608
Was it so terrible here
with me?

1791
01:37:32,813 --> 01:37:35,304
We just got off
the track a little.

1792
01:37:36,584 --> 01:37:37,778
A lot.

1793
01:37:39,453 --> 01:37:41,478
You're asking me
to turn my back

1794
01:37:41,555 --> 01:37:43,045
on our whole life together?

1795
01:37:43,757 --> 01:37:44,985
Oh, no.

1796
01:37:46,393 --> 01:37:48,418
I'm asking you to
remember the life

1797
01:37:48,495 --> 01:37:50,224
that we wanted to have.

1798
01:37:50,664 --> 01:37:53,394
God, Bette. You took
it all on by yourself,

1799
01:37:53,467 --> 01:37:54,957
didn't you?
And I let you.

1800
01:37:57,504 --> 01:37:59,199
You were so good.

1801
01:38:00,140 --> 01:38:03,337
I'm asking you to
let go a little. Open up.

1802
01:38:04,144 --> 01:38:06,874
Not just to me,
but to the world.

1803
01:38:07,615 --> 01:38:10,607
We used to have
such good times, remember?

1804
01:38:10,684 --> 01:38:12,709
We used to dance together

1805
01:38:13,020 --> 01:38:14,578
all slow.

1806
01:38:14,722 --> 01:38:17,486
You were such
a wonderful dancer.

1807
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:23,561
And I want to dance with you
again before I die.

1808
01:38:24,265 --> 01:38:26,233
Don't talk
about dying.

1809
01:38:26,433 --> 01:38:29,061
That's okay.
We're all going to die.

1810
01:38:29,570 --> 01:38:31,333
Dying is not a sin.

1811
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:34,664
Not living is.

1812
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,262
Good morning, Mother.

1813
01:40:07,334 --> 01:40:08,562
Good morning.

1814
01:40:22,683 --> 01:40:24,048
Nice outfit.

1815
01:40:24,184 --> 01:40:25,549
Your father likes it.

1816
01:40:34,962 --> 01:40:36,429
Mr. Tremont?

1817
01:40:37,765 --> 01:40:39,392
I have some news.

1818
01:40:40,667 --> 01:40:42,191
It's not good.

1819
01:40:43,003 --> 01:40:44,368
What is it?

1820
01:40:45,606 --> 01:40:48,734
Well, of course it's not
the same in all cases,

1821
01:40:48,909 --> 01:40:50,536
but it seems, uh...

1822
01:40:52,079 --> 01:40:55,276
It's okay, good doctor,
you can tell me the truth.

1823
01:40:58,018 --> 01:40:59,610
Cancer's back.

1824
01:41:02,756 --> 01:41:04,223
It's spread.

1825
01:41:04,925 --> 01:41:06,916
It's in the lymph system.

1826
01:41:10,230 --> 01:41:11,561
How long?

1827
01:41:12,132 --> 01:41:13,497
It's difficult to say.

1828
01:41:13,567 --> 01:41:15,194
Different patients
respond differently.

1829
01:41:15,602 --> 01:41:16,864
Dr. Chad?

1830
01:41:20,140 --> 01:41:21,607
I don't know.

1831
01:41:38,125 --> 01:41:40,184
Hey, Dad, what are
you doing up so late?

1832
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:41,591
Waiting for you.

1833
01:41:42,396 --> 01:41:43,727
Why?

1834
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:45,929
You realize your
mother and I separated

1835
01:41:45,999 --> 01:41:48,524
before you were old enough
to stay out late?

1836
01:41:49,636 --> 01:41:51,001
I think I feel

1837
01:41:52,139 --> 01:41:55,939
deprived of my divine right
as a father to worry.

1838
01:41:56,143 --> 01:41:58,338
Do you want me go out
and come back in again?

1839
01:41:58,412 --> 01:42:01,142
No, I want you to sit
down and talk to me.

1840
01:42:04,585 --> 01:42:07,019
What would you
like to talk about?

1841
01:42:08,288 --> 01:42:11,052
I'm trying to think of
something I can tell you.

1842
01:42:11,125 --> 01:42:13,923
Some fatherly advice
you can take back with you.

1843
01:42:13,994 --> 01:42:15,461
Some insight.

1844
01:42:16,263 --> 01:42:18,356
I can't think of anything.

1845
01:42:19,299 --> 01:42:21,631
I think it's me.
I think it's...

1846
01:42:22,669 --> 01:42:25,866
I think it's tough for guys
my age to reach out.

1847
01:42:29,877 --> 01:42:31,742
You know,
every time we see each other,

1848
01:42:31,812 --> 01:42:33,245
it's always on the fly.

1849
01:42:33,313 --> 01:42:35,076
You're going or I'm coming,

1850
01:42:35,149 --> 01:42:37,174
or we're at
somebody's wedding.

1851
01:42:37,651 --> 01:42:40,950
We're always talking
over suitcases and backpacks

1852
01:42:41,421 --> 01:42:43,889
or holding little
sandwiches in our hand.

1853
01:42:46,827 --> 01:42:49,125
I don't know a lot
about you.

1854
01:42:49,229 --> 01:42:50,662
Well, um,

1855
01:42:52,166 --> 01:42:53,895
let's see, I'm 5' 11",

1856
01:42:53,967 --> 01:42:56,162
I like sports,
I'm into bikes-

1857
01:42:56,236 --> 01:42:58,704
Don't do that.
Don't-don't make a joke.

1858
01:43:00,207 --> 01:43:02,732
You know, we always do that.
We come close

1859
01:43:02,910 --> 01:43:04,343
to-to saying something real

1860
01:43:04,411 --> 01:43:06,003
and then one of us
makes a joke.

1861
01:43:06,813 --> 01:43:08,212
Talk to me.

1862
01:43:09,383 --> 01:43:11,214
Tell me about Mexico.

1863
01:43:12,486 --> 01:43:14,147
I like it there.

1864
01:43:14,855 --> 01:43:17,289
It's not like school.
There's no pressure.

1865
01:43:17,357 --> 01:43:20,292
Uh, the people are
real and thoughtful.

1866
01:43:21,228 --> 01:43:22,217
Um,

1867
01:43:23,263 --> 01:43:26,198
the days have kind of
a nice rhythm to 'em.

1868
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:28,927
You have a lot
of friends there?

1869
01:43:29,002 --> 01:43:30,993
Yeah, there's
about five of us.

1870
01:43:31,071 --> 01:43:32,868
You know,
we live as a group.

1871
01:43:33,607 --> 01:43:34,835
We take turns workin'.

1872
01:43:34,908 --> 01:43:36,068
We share everything we make.

1873
01:43:36,143 --> 01:43:38,771
We share the cleaning,
the housework.

1874
01:43:38,979 --> 01:43:40,708
It's a real family.

1875
01:43:42,616 --> 01:43:44,846
The other guys
from your school, too?

1876
01:43:44,918 --> 01:43:47,011
Well, two of the guys
are girls.

1877
01:43:51,291 --> 01:43:53,316
The world has changed, Billy.

1878
01:43:53,393 --> 01:43:54,724
You can't believe

1879
01:43:54,795 --> 01:43:56,160
the way
the world has changed.

1880
01:43:57,898 --> 01:44:00,059
Why was making money
always more important to you

1881
01:44:00,133 --> 01:44:01,691
than me or Mom?

1882
01:44:01,935 --> 01:44:02,924
Oh.

1883
01:44:03,136 --> 01:44:04,433
You said you wanted to talk.

1884
01:44:04,571 --> 01:44:05,868
All right.

1885
01:44:10,043 --> 01:44:12,807
Because, uh, that's what
I thought a man was.

1886
01:44:13,614 --> 01:44:17,243
What I thought a father was.
Some guy who wore a suit

1887
01:44:17,551 --> 01:44:19,519
and made a lot of money.

1888
01:44:23,590 --> 01:44:25,683
All right, that's too easy.

1889
01:44:27,394 --> 01:44:29,760
Because I liked
the power of it.

1890
01:44:30,430 --> 01:44:32,830
I liked being the guy
who got the job done,

1891
01:44:32,899 --> 01:44:35,163
the guy who
everybody comes to.

1892
01:44:35,369 --> 01:44:38,031
And something had to give

1893
01:44:39,706 --> 01:44:41,503
and it was my family.

1894
01:44:41,775 --> 01:44:43,902
Well, I would never do that.

1895
01:44:44,711 --> 01:44:46,872
I would never run away
from my family.

1896
01:44:46,947 --> 01:44:49,848
Leaving was
the toughest thing I ever did.

1897
01:44:51,485 --> 01:44:52,816
It didn't seem like it.

1898
01:44:52,886 --> 01:44:53,910
Well, that's because

1899
01:44:53,987 --> 01:44:55,978
we tried to make it
look normal.

1900
01:44:56,590 --> 01:44:58,854
That's what all
the books said to do.

1901
01:44:58,925 --> 01:45:00,756
The "normal" divorce.

1902
01:45:02,062 --> 01:45:03,825
But there was pain.

1903
01:45:03,897 --> 01:45:06,297
A lot. There still is.

1904
01:45:09,569 --> 01:45:11,469
I've missed you, Billy.

1905
01:45:11,805 --> 01:45:15,764
And you may not need me
or even want me around.

1906
01:45:16,977 --> 01:45:19,411
But I'd like to stay
in your life.

1907
01:45:20,914 --> 01:45:22,506
I'm your father.

1908
01:45:30,157 --> 01:45:33,149
I guess there is some advice
I'd like to give you.

1909
01:45:33,226 --> 01:45:34,386
To give to a guy

1910
01:45:34,461 --> 01:45:35,826
who's about to
take on the world.

1911
01:45:36,730 --> 01:45:38,095
What is it?

1912
01:45:40,434 --> 01:45:41,924
Be forgiving.

1913
01:45:57,250 --> 01:46:00,083
Hi.
How's he doing?

1914
01:46:00,721 --> 01:46:03,281
Okay.
He slept a little.

1915
01:46:03,357 --> 01:46:05,120
You've been
here all afternoon?

1916
01:46:05,192 --> 01:46:07,387
He does better
when I'm here.

1917
01:46:07,994 --> 01:46:10,360
Come on, let's go down
and get something to eat.

1918
01:46:10,430 --> 01:46:11,829
The doctor
will be here soon.

1919
01:46:11,898 --> 01:46:13,263
I don't want to
miss him.

1920
01:46:13,333 --> 01:46:15,028
Go ahead.
I'll come get you.

1921
01:46:15,102 --> 01:46:16,399
Come on.

1922
01:46:41,161 --> 01:46:42,719
Where's Mother?

1923
01:46:43,063 --> 01:46:45,588
She went down with Billy
to get something to eat.

1924
01:46:45,665 --> 01:46:46,996
Oh, good.

1925
01:46:48,935 --> 01:46:50,493
How you feelin'?

1926
01:46:52,205 --> 01:46:53,263
Perfect.

1927
01:46:53,340 --> 01:46:54,307
Yeah, I can tell.

1928
01:46:54,941 --> 01:46:56,602
You know what I've
been thinking about?

1929
01:46:56,676 --> 01:46:58,007
What?

1930
01:46:58,078 --> 01:47:00,876
1947 World Series.

1931
01:47:01,181 --> 01:47:02,148
What?

1932
01:47:02,215 --> 01:47:03,944
Isn't that crazy?
I know, I mean,

1933
01:47:05,085 --> 01:47:06,552
at a time like this,

1934
01:47:06,653 --> 01:47:08,621
I should be having
very deep thoughts.

1935
01:47:09,756 --> 01:47:10,984
I'm trying,

1936
01:47:11,091 --> 01:47:13,389
but all that keeps going
through my mind is

1937
01:47:13,460 --> 01:47:16,452
old ball games
and old TV themes.

1938
01:47:22,202 --> 01:47:23,464
Bonanza.

1939
01:47:23,804 --> 01:47:25,271
Oh, this is great,
Dad.

1940
01:47:25,338 --> 01:47:27,329
What about
the '47 World Series?

1941
01:47:27,407 --> 01:47:28,965
How's that fit in?

1942
01:47:29,976 --> 01:47:31,944
It produced one of
the great moments

1943
01:47:32,012 --> 01:47:33,707
in baseball history.

1944
01:47:34,514 --> 01:47:36,072
They were between

1945
01:47:36,149 --> 01:47:38,617
the Yankee centerfielder
Joe DiMaggio,

1946
01:47:39,319 --> 01:47:42,117
the Prince of Players,
the Star of Stars,

1947
01:47:43,089 --> 01:47:45,353
and the Dodger left-fielder,

1948
01:47:45,425 --> 01:47:49,327
Al Gionfriddo,
a second-stringer.

1949
01:47:49,896 --> 01:47:52,660
He only played that day because
the regular left-fielder,

1950
01:47:52,732 --> 01:47:54,893
Carl Furillo, got hurt.

1951
01:47:55,869 --> 01:47:57,769
Do you know this story?

1952
01:47:58,071 --> 01:47:59,595
Tell it to me.

1953
01:48:01,141 --> 01:48:02,904
Well, in the sixth game,

1954
01:48:03,677 --> 01:48:07,340
bottom of the sixth inning,
it was 8-5, Dodgers.

1955
01:48:08,415 --> 01:48:10,280
Two on, two out.

1956
01:48:11,418 --> 01:48:13,409
Up steps DiMaggio.

1957
01:48:14,221 --> 01:48:17,088
Hit a smash,
deep left field,

1958
01:48:17,157 --> 01:48:19,591
had home run
written all over it.

1959
01:48:19,659 --> 01:48:21,422
Everyone in
the stands knew it.

1960
01:48:21,495 --> 01:48:25,295
I knew it. DiMaggio knew it.
It was perfect.

1961
01:48:25,999 --> 01:48:30,299
But here comes this
little Gionfriddo guy.

1962
01:48:30,504 --> 01:48:32,404
He's racing
after the ball.

1963
01:48:32,472 --> 01:48:35,669
And he doesn't realize
it was hit by Joe DiMaggio.

1964
01:48:36,943 --> 01:48:40,936
At the last possible moment,
he jumps.

1965
01:48:41,781 --> 01:48:43,942
Reaches over the rail,

1966
01:48:46,052 --> 01:48:49,818
robs DiMaggio
of a three-run homer. Hmm.

1967
01:48:50,457 --> 01:48:53,551
It was an incredible catch.
It'll live forever.

1968
01:48:53,894 --> 01:48:55,054
But

1969
01:48:55,795 --> 01:48:58,662
then comes
the really amazing thing.

1970
01:49:00,667 --> 01:49:03,659
DiMaggio was just approaching
second base

1971
01:49:03,737 --> 01:49:07,901
when he sees Gionfriddo
make this catch.

1972
01:49:08,909 --> 01:49:12,777
He got so upset,
he kicked the dirt.

1973
01:49:16,316 --> 01:49:18,113
How do you like that?

1974
01:49:20,353 --> 01:49:24,255
This man who never
showed any emotion,

1975
01:49:26,192 --> 01:49:28,092
he was human after all.

1976
01:49:29,329 --> 01:49:33,060
And it took Al Gionfriddo
to bring it out.

1977
01:49:35,669 --> 01:49:37,967
You know what
that means to me?

1978
01:49:38,438 --> 01:49:39,700
What?

1979
01:49:40,407 --> 01:49:43,774
In America,
anything is possible

1980
01:49:44,210 --> 01:49:46,201
if you show up for work.

1981
01:49:54,588 --> 01:49:56,852
Sometimes I wish
I'd held you more

1982
01:49:56,957 --> 01:49:58,288
when you were a kid.

1983
01:50:00,293 --> 01:50:02,227
I wish I kissed you more.

1984
01:50:02,295 --> 01:50:04,490
You did fine, Dad,
just fine.

1985
01:50:06,666 --> 01:50:09,032
Do you know
how much I love you?

1986
01:50:10,904 --> 01:50:11,893
Yeah.

1987
01:50:34,094 --> 01:50:36,187
A lot has happened,
Johnny.

1988
01:50:37,230 --> 01:50:39,061
Some good, some bad.

1989
01:50:42,602 --> 01:50:45,036
But when I look
at you, I know,

1990
01:50:47,107 --> 01:50:49,507
I must have done
something right.

1991
01:51:05,892 --> 01:51:07,519
Honey, I'm gonna
put these in the car.

1992
01:51:07,594 --> 01:51:08,822
Okay.

1993
01:51:08,895 --> 01:51:09,987
Did you
talk to Mom?

1994
01:51:10,063 --> 01:51:11,587
Yeah. Mom will stay
here for now.

1995
01:51:11,665 --> 01:51:13,292
At least till the middle of next month.

1996
01:51:13,366 --> 01:51:14,355
And then we'll see.

1997
01:51:14,434 --> 01:51:15,423
All right.

1998
01:51:15,502 --> 01:51:17,402
I think she'll be okay.

1999
01:51:24,544 --> 01:51:26,444
How you holding up?

2000
01:51:27,013 --> 01:51:28,412
I miss him.

2001
01:51:29,082 --> 01:51:30,344
Yeah, me too.

2002
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:34,786
Go ahead,
I'll catch up with you.

2003
01:51:37,590 --> 01:51:39,217
I need a minute.

2004
01:52:05,518 --> 01:52:06,815
Go ahead.

2005
01:52:07,287 --> 01:52:08,276
Um...

2006
01:52:10,990 --> 01:52:12,355
Grandpa,

2007
01:52:12,959 --> 01:52:14,426
we just wanted
to take some time

2008
01:52:14,494 --> 01:52:16,359
to say good-bye our way.

2009
01:52:16,429 --> 01:52:18,363
I- I guess
it's your way.

2010
01:52:18,965 --> 01:52:19,954
Um,

2011
01:52:20,066 --> 01:52:22,125
and this seemed like
the right place to do it.

2012
01:52:22,202 --> 01:52:23,965
Because there's so much
of you in here.

2013
01:52:24,037 --> 01:52:26,437
So much that's
alive and growing.

2014
01:52:27,273 --> 01:52:29,707
Which is still
how I think of you.

2015
01:52:30,343 --> 01:52:31,605
It's going to be funny.

2016
01:52:31,678 --> 01:52:32,702
Yeah.

2017
01:52:36,850 --> 01:52:39,785
Grandpa, I love you
and I miss you already.

2018
01:52:43,823 --> 01:52:46,485
Dad and I are here
and we're together.

2019
01:52:49,729 --> 01:52:52,823
This is good.
This is a good idea.

2020
01:52:54,334 --> 01:52:55,824
I feel better.

2021
01:52:57,637 --> 01:52:58,968
Me, too.
