1
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,716
There comes a time
for every vampire...

2
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:38,138
...when the idea of eternity becomes
momentarily unbearable.

3
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:42,559
Living and feeding in the shadows
with only your own company...

4
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:46,814
...rots into a solitary,
hollow existence.

5
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:49,608
Immortality seems like a good idea...

6
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:53,904
...until you realize
you're going to spend it alone.

7
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:58,659
So I slept, hoping the sounds
of the passing eras would fade out...

8
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,120
...and a sort of death might happen.

9
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:06,041
But as I lay there, the world didn't
sound like the place I had left...

10
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,795
...but something different.

11
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,422
Better...

12
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:49,293
It became worthwhile to rise again
as new gods were born and worshiped.

13
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,671
Night and day, they were never alone.

14
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:56,717
I would become one of them.

15
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:29,333
Whether it was the meal or
the 100 years of rest, I'm not sure.

16
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,920
But suddenly
I was feeling better than ever.

17
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,339
My senses so high...

18
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:40,344
...they led me straight to the
instrument of my resurrection...

19
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:44,431
...playing in my old house.

20
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,420
Jesus.

21
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,298
Your voice...

22
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,175
Who the hell are you?

23
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:24,805
The question provoked
an irresistible urge.

24
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:27,933
I am the vampire Lestat.

25
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,185
It just rolled out of my mouth.

26
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:34,106
With one sentence,
I betrayed everything about my kind.

27
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,316
Betrayed our code of secrecy.

28
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:38,568
Vampire?

29
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:42,364
- That's funny.
- Indeed.

30
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:45,075
Hilarious.

31
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,953
You're all...

32
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,871
...so beautiful.

33
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:54,084
- Your hands are...
- Cold as death?

34
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,337
- You're gonna kill us?
- No.

35
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:02,467
All that you've ever dreamed of,
I'm going to make yours.

36
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,304
This is your lucky day.

37
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,889
It was a bold move, I admit.

38
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:12,477
But from that moment on they were
my friends, my children, my band.

39
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:16,273
Giving the world a new god. Me.

40
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,608
I'm over it

41
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:26,283
You see I'm falling in a vast abyss

42
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:30,495
Crowded by memories of the past

43
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:35,250
At last I see

44
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:39,796
I hear it fading
I can't speak it

45
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:44,301
Or else you will dig my grave

46
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:49,348
You fear them finding
Always whining

47
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:53,435
Take my hand now
Be alive

48
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:59,274
You see I cannot be forsaken

49
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:04,071
Because I'm not the only one

50
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:08,867
We walk amongst you
Feeding, raping

51
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:14,039
Must we hide from everyone?

52
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:23,548
You see I cannot be forsaken

53
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:28,428
Because I'm not the only one

54
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:33,183
We walk amongst you
Feeding, raping

55
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:38,063
Must we hide from everyone?

56
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,906
Everyone

57
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,040
Everyone

58
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:13,014
Okay, can I have your attention?
Okay, some questions. One at a time.

59
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,768
- Yeah, you.
- So why here in London?

60
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,604
We go where we're told to, like you.

61
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:25,110
- How would you sum up your music?
- Sex, blood and rock 'n' roll.

62
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,404
Okay, excuse me.

63
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,282
It's time.

64
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,159
May I present...

65
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:36,037
...the vampire Lestat.

66
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,169
Good evening.

67
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:48,425
Sorry I'm late. I was just trying
to catch my breakfast.

68
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:54,598
Okay, can we keep it short?
One at a time.

69
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:56,141
Yeah, you.

70
00:07:56,559 --> 00:08:00,228
I may be wrong, but what
I remember about vampires is...

71
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:03,523
...you generally keep
your identity secret.

72
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:07,152
Yes. But why hide it
in this day and age?

73
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:10,030
I've hidden in the shadows
for centuries.

74
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,991
It's time to share myself
with the world.

75
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:18,371
Could you prove it? You know, give us
a demonstration of your powers.

76
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:23,835
If you like, I can give you a private
demonstration in your hotel tonight.

77
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:32,260
Your first and only concert's
in Death Valley, just days away.

78
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,931
- Why just the one?
- I don't like repeating myself.

79
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,977
There are rumors about
the hidden meaning in your lyrics...

80
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,898
...that you're giving away
vampire secrets. Something in all that?

81
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:50,529
Maybe I'm trying to resurrect a few
old friends. Daring them to come out.

82
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:55,158
Won't these vampires be pissed off
that you're giving away secrets?

83
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:59,162
I imagine they are, yes.

84
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,999
Do you have anything to say
to the other vampires?

85
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,253
As a matter of fact, I do.

86
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:12,592
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

87
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:18,014
See you all in Death Valley.

88
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:44,833
I heard Lestat keeps these
girls in his cellar. And it's nice.

89
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,752
They give you food
and cable and weed.

90
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,421
Oh, please.

91
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:54,426
But you have to let him suck you
on your neck whenever he wants.

92
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:57,804
- Doesn't sound too bad.
- Done worse.

93
00:09:58,014 --> 00:09:59,889
- I'll say.
- This way, girls.

94
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,072
So this is Lestat's house?

95
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,618
It is this week. We move around a lot.

96
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,328
Why is that?

97
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:25,290
What can I say? The guy is just...

98
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:32,422
- Boss. I didn't see you there.
- No. You wouldn't, would you?

99
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:39,387
Um, these are the girls
that you asked for.

100
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,640
Ah, yes.

101
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,492
Do you want me to take
the girls home later?

102
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,869
No, thank you, Roger.

103
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,789
I'll make sure they're taken care of.

104
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,543
You want some?

105
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:13,546
Want me?

106
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,341
You hungry?

107
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:24,057
You hungry for something else?

108
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:30,021
Come on.

109
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:33,983
- Don't you want to have some fun?
- Don't do that.

110
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,611
Are you ticklish?

111
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,489
I'm very ticklish.

112
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,724
Come out, come out...

113
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:50,393
...whoever you are.

114
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,320
Jesse.

115
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:05,325
Jesse.

116
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,076
A voice...

117
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,163
...calling to me...

118
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,457
...in my dreams.

119
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:16,336
The same dream I've had
since I was 6.

120
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,589
I have a family of my own.

121
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,592
Not a strange dream, really.

122
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,512
One every orphan has.

123
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,124
I'm sorry, but you must go.

124
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:59,128
Why can't I stay with you?
Please, Aunt Maharet.

125
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:02,799
I don't want you to go. But you must.

126
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,094
Aunt, you're bleeding.

127
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,769
You must be with your own.

128
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:19,691
I knew things were not normal.
This isn't the life for you.

129
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,987
I only knew I was part of them,
and being cast out.

130
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,446
Was I bad?

131
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,782
Had I done something wrong?

132
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,451
I'll always be watching over you.

133
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,121
I want to stay with you forever.

134
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,874
You can't.

135
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,605
When I lose control

136
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:02,942
Inside my body crumbles

137
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,870
I'm Serena Altschul, MTV News.

138
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:19,000
Vampire turned rocker Lestat
has returned with a new CD, Forsaken.

139
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,210
Although from New Orleans...

140
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,964
...he claims to be an 18th-century
French nobleman...

141
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,842
...who has been asleep
for over 100 years.

142
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:33,890
Here's a look at the new video
from the debut album, Redeemer.

143
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:47,195
Give your life to my charms

144
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:55,912
In the Admiral's Arms

145
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:16,599
The hunger inside given to me
Makes me what I am

146
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,353
Always it is calling me

147
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:25,024
For the blood of man

148
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:45,336
Like everyone, I assumed
Lestat was a joke.

149
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:50,675
A rock star with a gimmick. Then one
of his lyrics caught my attention.

150
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,262
"Take a walk down the aisle
at the end of the mile.

151
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:57,724
Give your life to my charms
in the Admiral's Arms. "

152
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,475
That rang a bell.

153
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,311
I tracked down old leases in London.

154
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:06,691
It turns out in the late 1600s
there was a pub in Mile End...

155
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,776
...called the Admiral's Arms.

156
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:12,155
It had a reputation for dealing
with black magic...

157
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,949
...and reports of people vanishing.

158
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:20,455
Here's where you could find
the Admiral's Arms in old London.

159
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:23,666
That part of London
is mostly warehouses...

160
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:28,004
...meat-packing plants and
a private club in the same location.

161
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,800
I think that it's a vampire coven.

162
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,762
And Lestat is leading us to it.

163
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:40,933
- Who took this picture?
- I did.

164
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:44,854
You're still an apprentice.
You don't do field work.

165
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,689
The Talamasca has a code.

166
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:50,526
I know. "Observe the dark realm,
but be not of it. "

167
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,654
Well, it's held good for 12 centuries.

168
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:57,784
We record and observe,
but never interfere.

169
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:00,119
I had to see it for myself.

170
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,208
Is David aware of this?

171
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,793
Jesse?

172
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,379
Hello, David.

173
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:14,842
I was explaining...
- Why don't you see me in my office?

174
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,265
This is a real coven.
In the middle of London.

175
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,852
All the more reason
to have told me first.

176
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,147
Listen, Jesse...

177
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:34,195
...we know about Lestat.

178
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,406
What he's doing is unprecedented.

179
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:39,992
So why is he doing it?

180
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:43,788
Aren't you curious?
Don't you think we should find out?

181
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,375
Let me show you something.

182
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,380
What do you see?

183
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,718
- Mid-1500s. Florence.
- Mm-hm.

184
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,429
This one?

185
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,270
- This man is in both.
- Yes.

186
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,983
All the different paint samples...

187
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,569
...all authentic.

188
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:18,447
Each painted at the time
of their particular style.

189
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,165
His name is Marius.

190
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,877
I've been tracing him for years.

191
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,421
My little obsession.

192
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,799
The closest we've come
to the original vampire.

193
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:40,720
Marius himself dates back to 400 B.C.

194
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,559
So he's older than Lestat.

195
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,936
He made Lestat.

196
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,022
How do you know that?

197
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,108
Because I have Lestat's journal.

198
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:58,946
I want to see it.

199
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:04,368
Promise me you'll never
go back to that place.

200
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:39,153
It was the winter of 1788.

201
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:44,325
And I was brought to a Mediterranean
island by the man who made me.

202
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:49,372
If a man is what you'd call him.

203
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,299
Lestat, welcome.

204
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,802
Who are you?

205
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:46,971
Do I know you?

206
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:53,352
I am unknowable by nature,
but you may call me Marius.

207
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:58,399
I'm the lord of a great manor.
They'll send an army to look for me.

208
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:01,652
I doubt they'll find you,
Lord de Lioncourt.

209
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,863
You're a long way from home.

210
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,685
You're weak...

211
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:36,645
...near passing.

212
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:41,108
I can barely hear your heartbeat.

213
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:47,531
The future hastens.
An age beyond my antique reason.

214
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:50,701
You will help me understand
these times.

215
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,162
That's why I chose you.

216
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:55,122
Chose me for what?

217
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,425
Drink...

218
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,552
...and live.

219
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:12,723
You've been brave enough
for one night, my son.

220
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,686
Drink...

221
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:21,190
...and learn.

222
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:26,112
Good, is it not?

223
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:32,493
No more. No more, Lestat.

224
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,788
No more!

225
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,533
Don't be afraid.

226
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,828
It's only your body that dies.

227
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,636
More.

228
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:38,517
I impressed my maker
with my thirst for things.

229
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:41,395
He set out to educate me
in the unknown.

230
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:46,192
Taught me all about the world,
its hidden history...

231
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,819
...and about myself.

232
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,577
That's enough, my son.

233
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:02,708
When you feed, hold back
from the moment of death.

234
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:07,505
Never take the last drop, or it will
draw you in and you will die.

235
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,262
Appreciate your prey.

236
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:24,688
Their blood that we take into us
carries with it life...

237
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:29,568
...their life, their knowledge,
their complexity.

238
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:36,158
My senses run amuck,
like a newborn child.

239
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:42,414
And as for my new powers, I was beside
myself with the pleasure of it all.

240
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,585
We've stayed long enough.

241
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,587
But we've spoken to no one.

242
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,924
A vampire's life
is a life of discretion.

243
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:53,717
Discretion?

244
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,345
Why must we hide, Marius?

245
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,890
We are the powerful,
we are the immortal.

246
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:03,602
We should walk fearless
in the open, no?

247
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,532
That cannot be.

248
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:20,244
We're vulnerable during the day.

249
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:24,623
Mortals must never know about us,
for the sake of all our kind.

250
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,251
So I could never know her?

251
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:29,795
Not unless you wanted to kill her.

252
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,929
So I can never be known?

253
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,393
You must be dead to the world.

254
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,980
Come on, time to leave.

255
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:51,210
Sophia, run! Run!

256
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:53,962
Go! Go...

257
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,048
Lestat...

258
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,550
...stop her!

259
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,386
You must!

260
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:41,927
We must remain in the shadows.

261
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:46,890
You still have a few
lingering mortal emotions.

262
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:51,353
They'll serve you no good, my friend.

263
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,826
Forgive me.

264
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:18,964
The faces of my victims
haunted me, reminding me of my fate.

265
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,508
For nights and days I played...

266
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:27,431
...furious that I would never partake
of the simple joys of the world.

267
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,892
I was meant for more than this.

268
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,350
Marius?

269
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:45,926
Marius?

270
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:35,434
Would you like me to play for you?

271
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:06,043
What have you done, Lestat?

272
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:19,097
More!
I don't think so, my lord.

273
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,308
- Let me go.
- No.

274
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:25,020
You've had the purest blood,
seen the oldest things.

275
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:30,650
- Far too much for one as young as you.
- Her blood is like liquid fire.

276
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,319
Who is she?

277
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,826
She's your mother.

278
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,079
She's my mother.

279
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:46,458
Akasha, the queen of all
who are damned.

280
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,086
And he's her king.

281
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:54,716
Akasha and Enkil nearly drank this
earth dry when they ruled over Egypt.

282
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:58,887
They drank until Enkil
lost his will to drink.

283
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:04,017
Without her mate beside her, she also
lost hers. They became living statues.

284
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:09,898
She respects nothing except the taste
of blood, human and immortal alike.

285
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,775
No. Release me!

286
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:20,242
She made you quite powerful.

287
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,702
You'll not stop me!

288
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:26,790
Can I hear her blood in your voice?

289
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:31,128
In all the years of my care,
not once have they moved.

290
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:35,048
Until tonight. And she chose me.

291
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,551
I chose you.

292
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:44,933
Where are you going?! Marius!

293
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,630
Marius?

294
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,138
Marius?

295
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:41,698
Marius!

296
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:48,705
Many times since, I have called
to Marius. But there was no answer.

297
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:53,710
Just the endless procession
of days, months...

298
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,462
...years.

299
00:36:56,589 --> 00:37:00,258
My teacher left me
to my darkest lesson.

300
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,636
That in the end, we are alone.

301
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:09,476
And there is nothing but the cold,
dark wasteland of eternity.

302
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:37,879
David thought the journal
would satisfy my curiosity.

303
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:41,675
But it only made me want
to know more.

304
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:44,552
I had to go back
to the Admiral's Arms.

305
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:47,180
I had no choice.

306
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:18,503
Gothic, isn't it?

307
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:21,381
I believe in people dying

308
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:23,508
I believe in people trying

309
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:26,678
This is a fantastic place. I love it.

310
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:30,181
You sure I can't get you a drink?

311
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,392
Soon.

312
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:37,981
I believe in people being

313
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,623
Hi.

314
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,958
- Hi.
- Come here often?

315
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:41,086
All the time.

316
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:47,759
I don't see any marks.

317
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,512
You haven't seen the rest of my body.

318
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:54,099
Is that an invitation?

319
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:56,434
Sorry, I'm taken.

320
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,436
And...

321
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,189
...where is your host?

322
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:02,982
Oh, he's here somewhere.

323
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:10,323
This host, what's his name?

324
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:15,662
Marius.

325
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:19,207
Sorry, don't know the guy.

326
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:23,795
Of course not. He's an ancient.
There are no ancients left.

327
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:26,673
They all turned to dust.

328
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:30,260
So unless you've got him
in a bottle somewhere...

329
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:33,471
You're brave to joke.
I wish you could meet him.

330
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:37,350
And why is that?
- Because you might learn something.

331
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,814
Excuse me.

332
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,324
Ah!

333
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,830
Going somewhere?

334
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:03,751
Now this will only hurt a little bit.

335
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:07,964
In fact, you might even enjoy it.

336
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:09,215
Don't do this.

337
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,321
Boo.

338
00:41:46,879 --> 00:41:50,256
That was quite a performance.

339
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:53,676
You should be more careful.

340
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:58,056
- Thanks.
- For what?

341
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,225
You saved me.

342
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,936
How presumptuous.

343
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:07,357
So you know Marius?

344
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,277
I know a lot of things.

345
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:14,197
Not how to stay alive, apparently.

346
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,658
I guess we have that in common.

347
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:20,119
Although I'm a little ahead
of the race here.

348
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,914
Well, I can fix that.

349
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:27,835
Your song "Redeemer" is about
the girl with the violin. Isn't it?

350
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:30,713
Yeah.

351
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,382
Is it?

352
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:37,595
What else do you think you know?

353
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:39,931
I...

354
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,600
You're shaking.

355
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,227
Cold.

356
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,771
Still cold?

357
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:52,277
So... Go on. Tell me more about me.

358
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,153
You want...

359
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:56,322
What do I want?

360
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:01,160
You yearn.
What do I yearn?

361
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,292
For what do I yearn?

362
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:09,627
To walk with the living.

363
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:15,633
Out of the cold,
dark wasteland of eternity.

364
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:20,221
Well...

365
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:25,977
...that makes you
a very clever librarian.

366
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:28,688
Talamasca.

367
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:32,442
I knew I left that journal somewhere.

368
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:39,157
- Was it a good read?
- It touched me.

369
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,367
Did it, now?

370
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,662
Don't worry, Jesse.

371
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,707
Your kind never satisfies my thirst.

372
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:54,088
Lestat, I know something
that's not in your journal.

373
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:57,717
What?

374
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:00,637
You still have the violin, don't you?

375
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,348
No, I understand.

376
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,059
After all, it's only human.

377
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,730
Ah!

378
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:04,742
Clever librarian.

379
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:18,881
David, listen, I'm going
to Los Angeles for the concert.

380
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,593
I met him, David. I talked to Lestat.

381
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:25,096
What? Jesse?

382
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:28,850
Listen to me very carefully now.

383
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:33,396
You are no longer seeing
things clearly.

384
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:37,483
Lestat told the world that vampires
live among us. They're mad.

385
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:42,155
They'll be at the concert to kill him.
You've become obsessed with it.

386
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:47,160
- I'm worried about you.
- Don't worry about me. I'll be okay.

387
00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:49,245
I'll check in and...

388
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:51,914
I'm sorry. I have to go.

389
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:53,708
No, Jesse...

390
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:14,520
The city of Lost Angels
already fed on the blood of youth.

391
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:17,940
My presence here barely
stirred a ripple.

392
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,568
We had three days till the concert.

393
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:23,279
I could feel something was coming.

394
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:26,657
I just couldn't figure out what.

395
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:35,583
And I've got nothing to elevate

396
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:42,632
I can't seem to concentrate

397
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:48,971
'Cause I've got nothing to consecrate

398
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,025
Marius.

399
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:14,831
Lestat.

400
00:47:16,208 --> 00:47:18,626
It is good to see you, Lestat.

401
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,295
And you.

402
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:25,216
Still wearing the old fashions, I see.

403
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:29,178
Old habits die hard.

404
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:34,517
How did you manage to slip
through the '50s in red velvet?

405
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:36,686
I slept.

406
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:40,314
Don't think you missed much.

407
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:45,194
- Elvis.
- Elvis, yes.

408
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:49,490
You're bigger than he is now.

409
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:50,867
So...

410
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:53,870
After all this time...

411
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:56,330
...what's the occasion?

412
00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:02,044
You've just become very hard to avoid
these days, at least in conversation.

413
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:06,591
- What are you trying to prove, Lestat?
- Oh, please.

414
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,970
It's a little too late to come over
all paternal now, Marius.

415
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:14,974
Two hundred years
and not a word from you.

416
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:19,353
You almost cost me everything.

417
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,858
Now you've done it again.

418
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:28,029
This isn't the time to settle
old scores.

419
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,783
Vampires don't settle old scores.

420
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,288
We harbor them.

421
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:43,419
How did you find me?

422
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:45,338
I made you.

423
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,965
I've always known where you are.

424
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,217
Besides...

425
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:54,889
...I just had to look for the most
gauche house on the block.

426
00:48:56,516 --> 00:49:01,562
Come. Let me show you what it means
to live in the light.

427
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:11,572
Impressive.

428
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:16,160
Reminds me of old mad druids
running around chanting in the forest.

429
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,454
A return to the primitive.

430
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:21,123
Out there, my fans...

431
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:24,043
...they worship me.

432
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:29,548
Millions of arms reach out to embrace,
beg me to come into their lives.

433
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:31,717
It's what you always wanted.

434
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:34,595
With all my black little heart.

435
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:39,266
Did you think of anyone but yourself?

436
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:42,979
I only have myself. You taught me that.

437
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:47,066
It may be time to get ready
for some company.

438
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:52,905
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Your music's woken an old friend.

439
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,450
Can't you hear it?

440
00:49:56,952 --> 00:50:00,538
Or is the applause all you
can hear now?

441
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:20,975
Akasha.

442
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:23,436
Arisen.

443
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:26,897
She has taken the king's blood.

444
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:29,025
Absorbed his power.

445
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:32,778
Good. Let her come.

446
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:35,239
Cancel the concert.

447
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:36,907
Never.

448
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:41,412
You're no match for her, Lestat.
You're not a god.

449
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:44,915
We were once mortals too.

450
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:48,711
It is our heritage we protect.

451
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,714
Such reverence for mortals.

452
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:54,925
Then you should have left me as one.

453
00:51:55,612 --> 00:52:00,950
Scent is fading.
He was here too long ago.

454
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:02,868
You like him, do you?

455
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:06,038
He reminds me of someone.

456
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:10,960
All he's going to remind you of soon
is a pile of bones.

457
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:14,296
We're going to dismember him.
Bleed him dry.

458
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:15,673
Really?

459
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:20,386
Is that what you're going to do?

460
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:22,192
Old gods on new streets.

461
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:26,155
Not only had the concert sold out
among the living...

462
00:55:26,364 --> 00:55:29,491
...it seemed all the undead
were coming too.

463
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:32,536
There would be angry vampires
out there...

464
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:36,915
...frightened of the light I was
directing on all our kind.

465
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:40,669
Do you have anything to say
to the other vampires?

466
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:44,715
Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.

467
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:49,053
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

468
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,889
They wanted me dead.

469
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:53,807
Let them try.

470
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:55,601
Bring it on.

471
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:58,812
Better dead than alone.

472
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:17,039
Hey, honey. Want tickets for tomorrow?

473
00:56:17,248 --> 00:56:19,041
- Going to the show?
- No.

474
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:22,961
- Come on, I got them for $200.
- $200?! I don't think so.

475
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:29,051
What if I say 150?
150? You're gonna cut me a deal?

476
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:33,472
So, listen, just two girls, okay?
So how old are you again?

477
00:56:36,434 --> 00:56:39,728
- Check it out. Champagne?
- Yeah.

478
00:56:56,871 --> 00:57:02,000
Oh, my God, I can't believe
it's really you! I'm your biggest fan.

479
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:05,421
Boo.

480
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:07,673
Boo back.

481
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:11,218
Lestat, I came all the way
from Tarzana.

482
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:12,511
Really?

483
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:15,180
- And you?
London.

484
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:18,976
A London Goth. I see.

485
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:24,815
It's funny, I would have pegged you
for a Talamascan.

486
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:27,651
Maybe in another life.

487
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:29,486
I'm an Episcopalian.

488
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:33,449
And I'm a frigging Buddhist.
Uh, Lestat...

489
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:37,995
Roger, would you take our little
Episcopalian back to church?

490
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:40,706
Just the one tonight? Sure.

491
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:44,168
- Sweetheart, come on.
What?

492
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:46,503
- Come on.
- What?!

493
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:49,882
It's a good thing.
Can I still go backstage?

494
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:54,178
Why are you following me?

495
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:55,888
What do you want?

496
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:13,697
So you come all this way
just to return this to me?

497
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:16,825
Out of the goodness of your heart?

498
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:22,164
I want you to show me what it's like.

499
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:25,667
What what is like, exactly?

500
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:28,086
To be like you.

501
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:33,175
I don't have time for this.

502
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:37,804
- All a vampire has is time.
- Not this one.

503
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:40,974
Right.

504
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:43,894
The covens are coming for you.

505
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:48,774
How are you going to spend your last
night, as you always have, alone?

506
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:50,192
Why not?

507
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:53,320
Why not share it with me?

508
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,700
All right.

509
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:04,790
This may be painful for a mortal.

510
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:08,168
You're still attached to your skin.

511
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,921
I don't care.

512
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:15,342
Do you trust me?

513
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:20,639
Yes.

514
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:32,150
Then close your eyes.

515
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,480
Marius was right.

516
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:54,858
But I never understood
until I met you.

517
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:57,486
What do you mean?

518
01:00:57,695 --> 01:01:00,989
You're beautiful to me
because you're human.

519
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:03,367
Your frailty...

520
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:05,577
...your short years...

521
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:09,706
...your heart...

522
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:12,709
...even as you think it's breaking.

523
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,882
All that...

524
01:01:20,301 --> 01:01:24,971
...seems suddenly more precious
than anything I have ever known.

525
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:31,061
I'm not as precious as you think.

526
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:41,947
Do it.

527
01:01:45,576 --> 01:01:47,035
Please.

528
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:55,585
Let me be with you.

529
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:00,424
Let me know everything.

530
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:11,101
You want to know everything?

531
01:02:13,187 --> 01:02:14,771
Come, then.

532
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,898
I'll show you.

533
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:42,883
What is it? What are we doing...?
- Shh.

534
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,179
Is she all right?

535
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:36,728
Get away! Get off me!

536
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:47,030
Now you see?

537
01:03:47,573 --> 01:03:48,990
Are you ready?

538
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:54,037
Now do you want it, huh?

539
01:03:57,124 --> 01:03:58,250
No.

540
01:03:58,709 --> 01:04:01,378
Of course you don't.

541
01:05:00,646 --> 01:05:03,440
They're pretty worked-up.
How you feeling?

542
01:05:03,649 --> 01:05:05,400
Hey, girls, come on!

543
01:05:06,611 --> 01:05:09,821
Okay, through here. Let him through!

544
01:05:10,197 --> 01:05:11,615
Back off, fella!

545
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:13,241
Come on, children.

546
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:15,619
Okay, guys. Come on!

547
01:05:17,955 --> 01:05:19,998
Let him through.

548
01:05:25,504 --> 01:05:26,922
Jesse!

549
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:30,800
Jesse!

550
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,139
Hello, David.

551
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:40,602
I must show you my new
paintings sometime.

552
01:05:58,037 --> 01:06:00,121
Lestat! Lestat! Lestat!

553
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:46,459
Walking waiting

554
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:50,005
Alone without a care

555
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:54,467
Hoping hating

556
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:57,971
Things that I can't bear

557
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:01,641
Did you think it's cool
To walk right up

558
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:06,187
To take my life and fuck it up?

559
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:08,606
Well, did you?

560
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:27,959
I see hell in your eyes

561
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:36,176
Taken in by surprise

562
01:07:38,846 --> 01:07:43,349
Touching you makes me feel alive

563
01:07:46,812 --> 01:07:52,692
Touching you makes me die inside

564
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:04,954
Find Jesse.

565
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:22,222
I see hell in your eyes

566
01:08:24,809 --> 01:08:30,522
Taken in by surprise

567
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:38,905
Touching you makes me feel alive

568
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:45,578
Touching you makes me die inside

569
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:55,338
You want more?

570
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:03,221
This one's for those who've come for me.

571
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:15,567
You think you're smart

572
01:09:16,902 --> 01:09:20,155
You're not
It's plain to see

573
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:23,324
That you want me to fall off

574
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:25,910
It's killing me

575
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:30,331
Let's see you got the gall

576
01:09:30,499 --> 01:09:34,002
Come take it all

577
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:39,716
The jury is coming

578
01:09:40,134 --> 01:09:44,304
Coming to tear me apart

579
01:09:44,471 --> 01:09:46,973
Lestat! Lestat!

580
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:27,305
Ooh!

581
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:42,880
Yeah!

582
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:04,235
Akasha.

583
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:25,983
Akasha?!

584
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:29,112
Why so surprised, my love?

585
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:31,948
You called, I have come.

586
01:13:33,033 --> 01:13:34,117
My love?

587
01:13:34,618 --> 01:13:37,161
Never fear me, Lestat.

588
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:40,456
All your wishes have come true.

589
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:42,291
My wishes?

590
01:13:44,503 --> 01:13:48,131
For a companion to share eternity.

591
01:13:50,634 --> 01:13:54,512
You're bold, like your music.

592
01:13:56,390 --> 01:14:01,352
You live your life in the open,
like I did long ago...

593
01:14:02,479 --> 01:14:04,272
...when I had a king.

594
01:14:04,815 --> 01:14:05,940
Had a king?

595
01:14:06,358 --> 01:14:08,067
He's no more.

596
01:14:08,861 --> 01:14:12,321
Now you are my consort.

597
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:15,450
That's why I kept you safe.

598
01:14:16,577 --> 01:14:18,161
Alive.

599
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:20,621
You?

600
01:14:22,374 --> 01:14:25,168
You thought it was all you?

601
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:28,129
Ah.

602
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:31,340
The ego of a king as well.

603
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:33,092
Yes.

604
01:14:34,344 --> 01:14:37,680
I know you, Lestat.

605
01:14:38,098 --> 01:14:42,185
I know that you crave to have
the world at your feet.

606
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:47,106
And I have come to give it to you.

607
01:14:49,026 --> 01:14:51,027
Where are we?

608
01:14:51,862 --> 01:14:53,821
We are home.

609
01:14:54,364 --> 01:14:59,619
We live everywhere
and anywhere we choose.

610
01:15:00,037 --> 01:15:03,748
The world is our garden.

611
01:17:28,560 --> 01:17:32,688
All these years I'd hoped
this place was real.

612
01:17:34,858 --> 01:17:40,196
For the first time in my life,
I feel like I'm home.

613
01:17:40,781 --> 01:17:44,825
Strange that this journey
should lead me here.

614
01:17:45,035 --> 01:17:48,287
This place that's haunted my dreams.

615
01:17:53,669 --> 01:17:56,504
Aunt, you're bleeding.

616
01:17:56,713 --> 01:17:58,923
You must be with your own.

617
01:18:01,551 --> 01:18:04,053
I'll always be watching over you.

618
01:18:04,304 --> 01:18:07,014
I want to stay with you forever.

619
01:18:08,225 --> 01:18:10,726
Forever is a very long time.

620
01:18:14,064 --> 01:18:15,731
Aunt Maharet.

621
01:18:25,742 --> 01:18:29,328
You haven't aged,
you haven't changed at all.

622
01:18:32,249 --> 01:18:34,625
I was once a mortal too.

623
01:18:34,918 --> 01:18:39,004
I bore a child before Akasha took me.
I took care of that child...

624
01:18:39,214 --> 01:18:42,925
...and her children,
and her children's children.

625
01:18:43,427 --> 01:18:45,678
This is our family.

626
01:18:45,887 --> 01:18:48,472
My way of coping with eternity.

627
01:18:50,517 --> 01:18:55,354
You are what keeps me connected
to the world of the living.

628
01:18:55,981 --> 01:19:00,109
When your parents died, I brought
you here to take care of you.

629
01:19:05,615 --> 01:19:08,409
Now is not the time.

630
01:19:09,786 --> 01:19:13,581
You were seeking answers
and now you've found them.

631
01:19:13,957 --> 01:19:17,710
The family is who you are.

632
01:20:48,718 --> 01:20:52,847
Drinking my blood allows you
to live in the light.

633
01:20:53,056 --> 01:20:58,018
And soon the sun will no longer
sting your eyes.

634
01:20:59,229 --> 01:21:03,774
This is but a taste
of what we shall share, my love.

635
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,569
My king...

636
01:21:07,404 --> 01:21:10,281
...behold our kingdom.

637
01:21:10,949 --> 01:21:13,325
A kingdom of corpses?

638
01:21:15,328 --> 01:21:18,747
- Why?
- Why not?

639
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:21,166
This is why you have risen?

640
01:21:21,376 --> 01:21:24,712
They believed in nothing.

641
01:21:25,088 --> 01:21:26,672
Now they are nothing.

642
01:21:33,305 --> 01:21:36,390
But you and I,
we will change all that.

643
01:21:37,601 --> 01:21:42,313
We will give the world something
to believe in again.

644
01:21:43,481 --> 01:21:45,566
Now come, my love.

645
01:21:45,942 --> 01:21:48,027
We have a score to settle.

646
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:02,791
Since my mortal death,
I have watched...

647
01:22:03,501 --> 01:22:07,796
...I have guided and cared
for my human family...

648
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:11,216
...generations beyond memory.

649
01:22:13,303 --> 01:22:16,972
This is why we must fight Akasha.

650
01:22:18,308 --> 01:22:23,145
- For the sake of your great family.
The world we know will end.

651
01:22:23,480 --> 01:22:27,483
The only way to prevent this
is through Akasha's destruction.

652
01:22:27,692 --> 01:22:29,193
But how?

653
01:22:29,778 --> 01:22:32,363
When she gives blood,
she's vulnerable.

654
01:22:32,572 --> 01:22:36,492
Whoever takes the last
of her blood will not survive it.

655
01:22:36,701 --> 01:22:38,327
What about Lestat?

656
01:22:38,536 --> 01:22:44,500
Lestat has joined with Akasha.
He's lost to us now. Forget him.

657
01:23:07,190 --> 01:23:08,774
My children.

658
01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:14,071
It warms my blood
to see you all gathered...

659
01:23:14,531 --> 01:23:16,115
...plotting against me.

660
01:23:16,324 --> 01:23:18,742
- Akasha.
- Maharet.

661
01:23:19,577 --> 01:23:24,415
- You will address my king first.
- Lestat, what has she done to you?

662
01:23:27,043 --> 01:23:29,586
Lestat, step aside.

663
01:23:30,046 --> 01:23:31,088
Never.

664
01:23:31,297 --> 01:23:33,882
The world has changed
since you reigned.

665
01:23:34,092 --> 01:23:36,260
Then we shall change it back.

666
01:23:36,553 --> 01:23:38,721
Humans are animals...

667
01:23:39,389 --> 01:23:41,390
...brute creatures.

668
01:23:41,599 --> 01:23:46,770
- Their destruction can only make sense.
- We've found other ways to coexist.

669
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:51,358
In silence! In shadows and shame!
And for what?

670
01:23:51,568 --> 01:23:53,569
For respect of mortals?

671
01:23:53,778 --> 01:23:55,863
They are nothing to us.

672
01:23:56,072 --> 01:23:57,948
They are merely food.

673
01:23:58,783 --> 01:24:00,159
Akasha, please...

674
01:24:00,368 --> 01:24:03,412
You think you can change my will?

675
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:07,041
I've had enough of this discussion.

676
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:08,792
Join me or die.

677
01:24:09,252 --> 01:24:10,878
I will not.

678
01:24:11,087 --> 01:24:12,880
- I will not.
- I will not.

679
01:24:13,089 --> 01:24:14,673
I will not.

680
01:24:22,849 --> 01:24:24,308
Do you love me?

681
01:24:26,186 --> 01:24:28,896
- Yes.
Then prove it.

682
01:24:31,024 --> 01:24:32,441
Kill her.

683
01:24:33,526 --> 01:24:36,612
- She's nothing to me.
- Just the same...

684
01:24:37,614 --> 01:24:39,948
...I'd like for you to kill her.

685
01:24:43,828 --> 01:24:48,874
- You will not touch her!
- You still think to challenge me?!

686
01:24:52,212 --> 01:24:56,173
- Now.
No, it's all right, Aunt Maharet.

687
01:24:56,966 --> 01:24:58,926
It's what I want.

688
01:25:05,308 --> 01:25:07,476
How sweet.

689
01:25:13,650 --> 01:25:15,234
I'm ready.

690
01:25:34,587 --> 01:25:35,879
Ah.

691
01:26:32,061 --> 01:26:34,146
See, my children?

692
01:26:35,315 --> 01:26:37,900
Remember your real family!

693
01:26:39,235 --> 01:26:40,861
Or join hers.

694
01:26:42,113 --> 01:26:43,697
Now...

695
01:26:45,617 --> 01:26:47,409
...give me my crown.

696
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:51,288
Spoken like a true king.

697
01:26:54,459 --> 01:26:56,126
Come.

698
01:27:06,262 --> 01:27:09,681
You see how he obeys?

699
01:27:10,099 --> 01:27:11,433
You will...

700
01:27:12,435 --> 01:27:15,062
...or you will all die.

701
01:27:20,777 --> 01:27:22,611
That is enough, Lestat.

702
01:27:32,538 --> 01:27:34,456
That is enough, Lestat! Stop!

703
01:28:42,567 --> 01:28:45,027
You kill me...

704
01:28:45,236 --> 01:28:48,280
...you kill yourselves.

705
01:29:33,368 --> 01:29:35,160
Wait, Lestat.

706
01:29:37,955 --> 01:29:39,414
You must stop.

707
01:32:14,403 --> 01:32:17,614
She drank Akasha's last drop.

708
01:32:19,033 --> 01:32:22,911
She took Akasha's death into herself.

709
01:32:24,288 --> 01:32:25,956
She's not dead.

710
01:32:26,874 --> 01:32:29,000
She sleeps.

711
01:33:27,602 --> 01:33:29,311
Hello?

712
01:34:01,927 --> 01:34:03,678
Oh, my God!

713
01:34:04,513 --> 01:34:06,056
Jesse?

714
01:34:07,183 --> 01:34:08,642
Hello, David.

715
01:34:20,321 --> 01:34:22,447
David, this is Lestat.

716
01:34:23,032 --> 01:34:27,035
- Hello.
- I have something for you.

717
01:34:30,915 --> 01:34:32,666
I believe...

718
01:34:32,958 --> 01:34:35,669
...that you wanted this back.

719
01:34:37,797 --> 01:34:41,591
Yes, thank you. Thank you so much.

720
01:34:51,894 --> 01:34:53,728
- Can I ask...?
What's it like?

721
01:34:53,896 --> 01:34:54,938
Yes.

722
01:34:55,356 --> 01:34:57,649
Do you want to find out?

723
01:34:58,651 --> 01:35:00,151
Me?

724
01:35:00,361 --> 01:35:02,987
No, I'm too old to live forever.

725
01:35:03,322 --> 01:35:06,241
Well, if you ever change your mind...

726
01:35:09,078 --> 01:35:10,870
So this is goodbye.

727
01:35:11,831 --> 01:35:13,164
Yes.

728
01:36:12,391 --> 01:36:14,392
Hello, David.
