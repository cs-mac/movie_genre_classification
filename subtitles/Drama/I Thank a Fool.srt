1
00:02:05,237 --> 00:02:06,831
Robin Williger.

2
00:02:06,933 --> 00:02:10,380
He is a 15-year-old freshman
from Racine, Wisconsin.

3
00:02:10,485 --> 00:02:12,110
He enjoys studying history.

4
00:02:12,212 --> 00:02:13,771
He's on the debate team.

5
00:02:13,876 --> 00:02:17,007
Robin's future looked
very, very bright,

6
00:02:17,108 --> 00:02:18,864
but recently he was
diagnosed with cancer,

7
00:02:18,963 --> 00:02:21,463
a very tough kind of cancer.

8
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:23,978
<i>Robin tells me he has
quit smoking, though,</i>

9
00:02:24,082 --> 00:02:27,180
and he no longer thinks
that cigarettes are cool.

10
00:02:31,154 --> 00:02:33,357
Whoo!

11
00:02:33,457 --> 00:02:36,589
And our final guest today
is Nick Naylor.

12
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:41,063
Mr. Naylor is the vice president
of the Academy of Tobacco Studies.

13
00:02:41,167 --> 00:02:44,069
Now, they are the tobacco
industry's main lobby

14
00:02:44,176 --> 00:02:45,419
in Washington, D.C.

15
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,453
and Mr. Naylor is
their chief spokesman.

16
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,431
<i>Few people on this planet know</i>

17
00:03:07,531 --> 00:03:09,572
<i>what it is to be truly despised.</i>

18
00:03:09,676 --> 00:03:11,814
<i>Can you blame them?</i>

19
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:14,185
<i>I earn a living
fronting an organization</i>

20
00:03:14,284 --> 00:03:17,414
<i>that kills 1,200 human beings a day.</i>

21
00:03:17,515 --> 00:03:18,660
<i>1,200 people.</i>

22
00:03:18,763 --> 00:03:21,150
<i>We're talking
two jumbojet plane loads</i>

23
00:03:21,258 --> 00:03:23,844
<i>of men, women and children.</i>

24
00:03:23,946 --> 00:03:24,928
<i>I mean, there's Attila,</i>

25
00:03:25,034 --> 00:03:26,495
<i>Genghis,</i>

26
00:03:26,602 --> 00:03:27,462
<i>and me,</i>

27
00:03:27,561 --> 00:03:28,772
<i>Nick Naylor,</i>

28
00:03:28,874 --> 00:03:29,855
<i>the face of cigarettes...</i>

29
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:32,612
<i>the Colonel Sanders of nicotine.</i>

30
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,120
<i>This is where I work,</i>

31
00:03:34,217 --> 00:03:36,638
<i>the Academy of Tobacco Studies.</i>

32
00:03:36,744 --> 00:03:38,817
<i>It was established
by seven gentlemen</i>

33
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,446
<i>you may recognize from C-SPAN.</i>

34
00:03:40,552 --> 00:03:43,072
<i>These guys realized quick
if they were going to claim</i>

35
00:03:43,175 --> 00:03:44,223
<i>that cigarettes were not addictive,</i>

36
00:03:44,327 --> 00:03:46,399
<i>they better have proof.</i>

37
00:03:46,503 --> 00:03:48,259
<i>This is the man they rely on,</i>

38
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:50,398
<i>Erhardt Von Grupten Mundt.</i>

39
00:03:50,503 --> 00:03:52,674
<i>They found him in Germany.</i>

40
00:03:52,775 --> 00:03:54,236
<i>I won't go into the details.</i>

41
00:03:54,343 --> 00:03:55,454
<i>He's been testing the link</i>

42
00:03:55,557 --> 00:03:56,736
<i>between nicotine
and lung cancer</i>

43
00:03:56,838 --> 00:03:59,967
<i>for 30 years and hasn't found
any conclusive results.</i>

44
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:00,930
<i>The man's a genius.</i>

45
00:04:01,029 --> 00:04:02,623
<i>He could disprove gravity.</i>

46
00:04:02,726 --> 00:04:04,318
<i>Then we've got our sharks.</i>

47
00:04:04,421 --> 00:04:06,111
<i>We draft them out
of Ivy League law schools</i>

48
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:08,416
<i>and give them time-shares
and sports cars.</i>

49
00:04:08,516 --> 00:04:10,010
<i>It's just like
a John Grisham novel-</i>

50
00:04:10,115 --> 00:04:12,571
<i>you know, without all the espionage.</i>

51
00:04:12,676 --> 00:04:15,773
<i>Most importantly,
we've got spin control.</i>

52
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,631
<i>That's where I come in.</i>

53
00:04:17,731 --> 00:04:19,040
<i>I get paid to talk.</i>

54
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:20,633
<i>I don't have an MD or law degree.</i>

55
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:26,011
<i>I have a bachelor's in
kicking ass and taking names.</i>

56
00:04:26,114 --> 00:04:28,448
<i>You know that guy
who can pick up any girl?</i>

57
00:04:28,546 --> 00:04:29,560
<i>I'm him</i>

58
00:04:29,665 --> 00:04:30,713
<i>on crack.</i>

59
00:04:33,888 --> 00:04:35,798
This is obviously a heated issue

60
00:04:35,904 --> 00:04:38,490
and we do have a lot
that we want to cover today.

61
00:04:39,391 --> 00:04:40,602
Nick, do you have a question?

62
00:04:40,704 --> 00:04:41,751
Joan,

63
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:45,499
how on earth would
Big Tobacco profit

64
00:04:45,599 --> 00:04:47,933
off of the loss of this young man?

65
00:04:48,031 --> 00:04:50,135
Now, I hate to think
in such callous terms,

66
00:04:50,238 --> 00:04:53,205
but, if anything,
we'd be losing a customer.

67
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,278
It's not only our hope,
it's in our best interest

68
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:58,520
to keep Robin alive and smoking.

69
00:04:58,622 --> 00:05:00,215
- That's ludicrous.
- Let me tell you something,

70
00:05:00,317 --> 00:05:02,073
Joan, and please,
let me share something

71
00:05:02,173 --> 00:05:05,652
with the fine, concerned
people in the audience today.

72
00:05:05,756 --> 00:05:09,170
The Ron Goodes of this world...

73
00:05:09,275 --> 00:05:11,731
want the Robin Willigers to die.

74
00:05:11,836 --> 00:05:12,882
- What?
You know why?

75
00:05:12,986 --> 00:05:14,513
So that their budgets will go up.

76
00:05:14,619 --> 00:05:17,368
This is nothing less than
trafficking in human misery,

77
00:05:17,466 --> 00:05:19,156
and you, sir, ought
to be ashamed of yourself.

78
00:05:19,257 --> 00:05:20,688
I ought to be ashamed of myself?

79
00:05:20,795 --> 00:05:23,793
As a matter of fact,
we're about to launch...

80
00:05:23,897 --> 00:05:26,767
a $50 million campaign

81
00:05:26,873 --> 00:05:30,866
aimed at persuading kids
not to smoke.

82
00:05:30,968 --> 00:05:33,040
Because I think
that we can all agree

83
00:05:33,144 --> 00:05:35,184
that there is nothing
more important

84
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:36,565
than America's children.

85
00:05:36,664 --> 00:05:37,972
All right, now,
that's something that

86
00:05:38,072 --> 00:05:39,762
we're going to want
to know more about.

87
00:05:39,863 --> 00:05:40,976
but I have to take a short break.

88
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:43,086
Hang on, a lot more coming.

89
00:05:45,943 --> 00:05:48,758
$50 million?! Are you
out of your fucking mind?!

90
00:05:48,854 --> 00:05:49,715
<i>Everyone has a boss.</i>

91
00:05:49,814 --> 00:05:50,676
<i>BR just happens</i>

92
00:05:50,775 --> 00:05:52,235
<i>to be mine.</i>

93
00:05:52,342 --> 00:05:54,130
<i>He came from the vending
machine world.</i>

94
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,822
<i>This made him tough.</i>

95
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,207
<i>The name BR came
from his tour in Vietnam.</i>

96
00:06:00,308 --> 00:06:03,275
<i>The people who know
its meaning are all dead.</i>

97
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,755
The deal was five million!

98
00:06:04,852 --> 00:06:07,502
$5 million will get you
a couple of subway posters.

99
00:06:07,603 --> 00:06:08,497
It's not going to impress anyone.

100
00:06:08,595 --> 00:06:09,708
That's the idea, Nick.

101
00:06:09,811 --> 00:06:10,706
You'll be thanking me soon.

102
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:11,915
This'll probably get you great press.

103
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:14,288
I gotta call the captain
and see if this is gonna fly.

104
00:06:14,387 --> 00:06:16,394
Get your ass back to D.C.

105
00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:31,535
Thank you so much for coming.

106
00:06:33,295 --> 00:06:34,157
Mr. Naylor?

107
00:06:34,255 --> 00:06:35,203
It's your turn.

108
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,548
Ah.

109
00:06:37,646 --> 00:06:39,621
Joey is such a bright young man.

110
00:06:39,727 --> 00:06:40,654
We all look forward

111
00:06:40,751 --> 00:06:42,442
to his coming out
of his shell a little.

112
00:06:42,542 --> 00:06:43,720
He's a bit shy.

113
00:06:43,823 --> 00:06:45,545
Yeah, he gets that from his mother.

114
00:06:54,317 --> 00:06:56,967
Hey, Joey.

115
00:06:57,069 --> 00:06:59,338
Please don't ruin my childhood.

116
00:06:59,437 --> 00:07:01,411
Come on, Joey. Trust me.

117
00:07:09,003 --> 00:07:11,938
How many of you want to be
lawyers when you grow up?

118
00:07:12,043 --> 00:07:12,991
Right.

119
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,529
How about...

120
00:07:14,634 --> 00:07:16,292
movie stars?

121
00:07:17,674 --> 00:07:18,754
How about lobbyists?

122
00:07:18,858 --> 00:07:19,751
What's that?

123
00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:21,704
It's kind of like being a movie star.

124
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:23,491
It's what I do.
I talk for a living.

125
00:07:23,593 --> 00:07:24,706
What do you talk about?

126
00:07:24,809 --> 00:07:26,783
I speak on behalf of cigarettes.

127
00:07:26,888 --> 00:07:28,067
My mom used to smoke.

128
00:07:28,169 --> 00:07:30,688
She says that cigarettes kill.

129
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:33,094
Really? Now, is your mommy a doctor?

130
00:07:33,192 --> 00:07:34,053
No.

131
00:07:34,151 --> 00:07:35,810
A scientific researcher of some kind?

132
00:07:35,912 --> 00:07:37,088
No.

133
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:38,085
Well, she doesn't exactly sound

134
00:07:38,183 --> 00:07:39,524
like a credible expert,
now, does she?

135
00:07:40,998 --> 00:07:41,860
Don't feel bad.

136
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,781
It's okay to listen to your mom.

137
00:07:43,877 --> 00:07:46,147
I mean, it's good to listen
to your parents... Joey.

138
00:07:46,246 --> 00:07:48,450
All I'm suggesting

139
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,851
is that there will always
be people trying to tell you

140
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:53,022
what to do and what to think.

141
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:54,434
There probably already are
people doing that.

142
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:55,393
Am I right?

143
00:07:55,492 --> 00:07:56,387
Yes.

144
00:07:56,486 --> 00:07:58,176
I'm here to say

145
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:01,571
that when someone tries to act
like some sort of an expert,

146
00:08:01,668 --> 00:08:05,016
you can respond, "Who says?"

147
00:08:05,123 --> 00:08:06,748
<i>So, cigarettes are good for you?</i>

148
00:08:06,851 --> 00:08:08,673
- No!
- No, that's not...

149
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:09,884
That's not what I'm getting at.

150
00:08:09,987 --> 00:08:12,224
My point is that you have
to think for yourself.

151
00:08:12,323 --> 00:08:13,980
You have to challenge authority.

152
00:08:14,081 --> 00:08:16,253
If your parents told you
that chocolate was dangerous,

153
00:08:16,355 --> 00:08:17,816
would you just take their word for it?

154
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:18,967
No.

155
00:08:19,073 --> 00:08:20,022
Exactly.

156
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,885
So perhaps instead of acting
like sheep

157
00:08:21,985 --> 00:08:22,911
when it comes to cigarettes,

158
00:08:23,008 --> 00:08:24,383
you should find out for yourself.

159
00:08:24,481 --> 00:08:25,561
Okay, then.

160
00:08:25,665 --> 00:08:27,933
Thank you, Mr. Naylor,
for joining us.

161
00:08:37,022 --> 00:08:39,477
<i>Every week we meet here at Bert's.</i>

162
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,492
<i>Together, we represent
the chief spokespeople</i>

Dad, why is the American
government the best government?

211
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,822
Because of our
endless appeals system.

212
00:10:25,808 --> 00:10:28,230
Joe, you're not writing down
what I just said are you?

213
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:29,447
Mm-hmm.

214
00:10:29,551 --> 00:10:31,460
Joey, stop for a second.

215
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:32,996
What is the subject of your essay?

216
00:10:33,103 --> 00:10:35,786
Why is American government
the best government in the world.

217
00:10:35,887 --> 00:10:37,447
Your teacher crafted that question?

218
00:10:37,551 --> 00:10:39,240
Yeah. Why?

219
00:10:39,341 --> 00:10:42,025
Well... I'll look past
the obvious problems

220
00:10:42,126 --> 00:10:43,370
in syntax for a moment,

221
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,475
and I'll focus more on the core
of the question.

222
00:10:45,581 --> 00:10:46,726
I mean, "A,"

223
00:10:46,829 --> 00:10:49,348
does America have
the best government in the world?

224
00:10:49,452 --> 00:10:51,045
And "B," what constitutes
a "best government"?

225
00:10:51,148 --> 00:10:53,482
Is it crime, is it poverty, literacy?

226
00:10:53,581 --> 00:10:54,953
Hmm?

227
00:10:55,052 --> 00:10:55,946
And America- definitely not best.

228
00:10:56,045 --> 00:10:57,189
Perhaps not even better than most.

229
00:10:57,292 --> 00:10:58,601
We do have a very
entertaining government...

230
00:10:58,698 --> 00:10:59,943
Dad.

231
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:01,799
I'm sorry.

232
00:11:03,051 --> 00:11:05,384
Are you familiar with the term "B.S."?

233
00:11:05,482 --> 00:11:06,976
Bullshit.

234
00:11:07,082 --> 00:11:08,294
Yes, exactly.

235
00:11:08,394 --> 00:11:11,176
B.S., if I may, is what
questions like the one

236
00:11:11,273 --> 00:11:13,096
your teacher posed are made for.

237
00:11:13,193 --> 00:11:15,048
Because even if America
had the best government,

238
00:11:15,144 --> 00:11:16,606
there'd be no way to prove it.

239
00:11:16,712 --> 00:11:17,990
And how many pages are you writing?

240
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:18,949
Two pages.

241
00:11:19,047 --> 00:11:20,575
Two pages...

242
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,175
Definitely not in two pages.

243
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:24,353
So what am I supposed to write?

244
00:11:24,456 --> 00:11:26,081
You can write whatever you want.

245
00:11:26,184 --> 00:11:27,526
Okay.

246
00:11:27,624 --> 00:11:28,572
Write about...

247
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:30,981
write about America's
amazing ability

248
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:33,948
to make profit by breaking down
trading tariffs

249
00:11:34,055 --> 00:11:36,324
and bringing American jobs
to Third World countries.

250
00:11:36,423 --> 00:11:38,277
Or how good we are
at executing felons.

251
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:39,935
They're all correct answers.

252
00:11:40,038 --> 00:11:41,925
I can do that?

253
00:11:42,021 --> 00:11:43,482
See, Joey, that's the beauty
of argument.

254
00:11:43,589 --> 00:11:45,890
'Cause if you argue correctly,
you're never wrong.

255
00:11:53,284 --> 00:11:56,066
Dad, if I finish
this essay within an hour,

256
00:11:56,164 --> 00:11:57,855
can we stay up all night?

257
00:11:57,956 --> 00:12:02,427
That's a negotiation,
not an argument.

258
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:05,148
Well, Conway, see you made it.

259
00:12:05,251 --> 00:12:07,192
Yeah, I guess that little
voice was wrong.

260
00:12:07,297 --> 00:12:08,345
I feel better.

261
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:09,562
I feel a lot better, too.

262
00:12:09,665 --> 00:12:12,120
As a matter of fact, I never
felt so good in my life.

263
00:12:12,225 --> 00:12:13,752
How about a cigarette?

264
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:30,966
Is he...?

265
00:12:31,071 --> 00:12:32,118
Yeah.

266
00:12:34,143 --> 00:12:37,437
Hey.

267
00:12:37,534 --> 00:12:40,829
Nick, you still own a watch, don't you?

268
00:12:40,925 --> 00:12:42,070
Jill, I can't help feeling

269
00:12:42,174 --> 00:12:43,635
Joey's getting the wrong idea
about his dad.

270
00:12:43,741 --> 00:12:45,202
It would be great if I could spend

271
00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:46,769
a little more time with him,
you know?

272
00:12:46,876 --> 00:12:50,226
To give him a fair
and balanced perspective.

273
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,120
Nick, you had plenty
of time for that.

274
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,627
Now you're his weekend guardian.

275
00:12:53,724 --> 00:12:55,665
Besides, he has Brad.

276
00:12:55,772 --> 00:12:56,819
He still needs his father.

277
00:12:56,922 --> 00:12:59,028
Nick.

278
00:12:59,131 --> 00:13:00,179
You have a second?

279
00:13:01,818 --> 00:13:03,095
Sure, Brad.

280
00:13:03,194 --> 00:13:06,805
Nick, your job
and everything aside,

281
00:13:06,905 --> 00:13:08,760
I hope you understand
that secondhand smoke's

282
00:13:08,858 --> 00:13:10,484
a real killer.

283
00:13:10,584 --> 00:13:12,374
What are you talking about?

284
00:13:12,473 --> 00:13:14,033
I just hope you're providing

285
00:13:14,137 --> 00:13:16,591
a smoke-free environment
for Joey, that's all I'm saying.

286
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:18,800
Brad, I'm his father.

287
00:13:18,904 --> 00:13:21,140
You're the guy fucking his mom.

288
00:13:23,448 --> 00:13:25,651
That was unnecessary.

289
00:13:25,815 --> 00:13:29,110
Thank you all.
Thank you all for coming.

290
00:13:29,207 --> 00:13:31,573
Tobacco is winning the war.

291
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:34,735
The war against our children.

292
00:13:34,837 --> 00:13:38,002
They like to use cartoons
and symbols to hook our kids.

293
00:13:38,102 --> 00:13:40,850
Well, now we have
a symbol of our own.

294
00:13:40,948 --> 00:13:43,054
Doctor.

295
00:13:43,157 --> 00:13:45,808
It is my hope that
within the year

296
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:47,533
every cigarette package

297
00:13:47,636 --> 00:13:50,538
sold in America
will carry this symbol.

298
00:13:50,643 --> 00:13:52,782
Perhaps then, cigarettes
will finally be labeled

299
00:13:52,883 --> 00:13:55,850
appropriately as poison.

300
00:13:55,955 --> 00:13:57,743
I will be holding
a congressional hearing

301
00:13:57,843 --> 00:14:00,461
to discuss the inclusion
of the skull and crossbones

302
00:14:00,562 --> 00:14:01,970
in the next two weeks.

303
00:14:02,067 --> 00:14:03,408
As usual, I extend
an open invitation

304
00:14:03,507 --> 00:14:05,895
to big tobacco.

305
00:14:06,001 --> 00:14:09,830
Perhaps this time they will
grace us with their presence.

306
00:14:09,937 --> 00:14:11,181
And their answers.

307
00:14:11,281 --> 00:14:12,622
Thank you very much.

308
00:14:17,137 --> 00:14:20,431
People, what is going on out there?

309
00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:24,008
I look down this table,
all I see are white flags.

310
00:14:24,111 --> 00:14:26,631
Our numbers are down
all across the board.

311
00:14:26,735 --> 00:14:28,523
Teen smoking-
our bread and butter,

312
00:14:28,622 --> 00:14:30,282
is falling like a shit from heaven.

313
00:14:32,334 --> 00:14:33,926
We don't sell Tic Tacs,
for Christ's sake.

314
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,623
We sell cigarettes.

315
00:14:35,725 --> 00:14:39,500
And they're cool and available
and addictive.

316
00:14:39,596 --> 00:14:41,156
The job is almost done for us.

317
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:47,563
This environmentalist
is challenging us.

318
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,115
We have to have an answer.

319
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,845
I'm asking you,

320
00:14:51,948 --> 00:14:53,703
when this cocksucker puts
Captain Hook on our products,

321
00:14:53,802 --> 00:14:55,264
what the fuck are we going to do?

322
00:14:55,371 --> 00:14:57,825
- BR.
- Yeah, Nick.

323
00:14:57,931 --> 00:14:59,075
If I may.

324
00:14:59,178 --> 00:15:01,512
In 1910,

325
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,999
the U.S. was producing
ten billion cigarettes a year.

326
00:15:04,105 --> 00:15:05,185
By 1930,

327
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:07,176
we were up to 123 billion.

328
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:09,161
What happened in between?

329
00:15:09,257 --> 00:15:10,849
Three things.

330
00:15:10,953 --> 00:15:11,881
A world war,

331
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:15,686
dieting... and movies.

332
00:15:15,784 --> 00:15:16,961
Movies?

333
00:15:17,064 --> 00:15:19,967
1927-talking pictures are born.

334
00:15:20,071 --> 00:15:22,210
Suddenly, directors need to give
their actors

335
00:15:22,311 --> 00:15:24,166
something to do
while they're talking.

336
00:15:24,263 --> 00:15:26,847
Cary Grant, Carole Lombard
are lighting up.

337
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:28,357
Bette Davis- a chimney.

338
00:15:28,454 --> 00:15:29,698
And Bogart-
remember the first picture

339
00:15:29,798 --> 00:15:30,813
with him and Lauren Bacall?

340
00:15:30,918 --> 00:15:33,285
Well, yea... not specifically.

341
00:15:33,382 --> 00:15:34,592
Oh, she sort

342
00:15:34,693 --> 00:15:36,700
of shimmies in
through the doorway,

343
00:15:36,804 --> 00:15:38,812
19 years old.

344
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:40,324
Pure sex.

345
00:15:40,421 --> 00:15:41,281
She says,

346
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:43,518
"Anyone got a match?"

347
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,246
And Bogie throws
the matches at her...

348
00:15:46,691 --> 00:15:48,513
and she catches them.

349
00:15:48,611 --> 00:15:52,026
Greatest romance of the century.

350
00:15:52,131 --> 00:15:54,204
How'd it start?
Lighting a cigarette.

351
00:15:54,308 --> 00:15:56,673
These days when someone
smokes in the movies,

352
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,870
they're either a psychopath
or a European.

353
00:15:59,971 --> 00:16:01,793
The message Hollywood
needs to send out

354
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,778
is smoking is cool.

355
00:16:03,873 --> 00:16:06,077
<i>We need the cast of Will and Grace</i>

356
00:16:06,178 --> 00:16:07,486
smoking in their living room.

357
00:16:07,585 --> 00:16:09,724
Forrest Gump puffing away
between his box of chocolates.

358
00:16:09,825 --> 00:16:13,085
Hugh Grant earning back
the love of Julia Roberts

359
00:16:13,184 --> 00:16:17,308
by buying her favorite brand-
her Virginia Slims.

360
00:16:17,408 --> 00:16:20,789
Most of the actors smoke already.

361
00:16:20,894 --> 00:16:23,033
If they start doing it on-screen,

362
00:16:23,135 --> 00:16:25,719
we can put the sex
back into cigarettes.

363
00:16:25,822 --> 00:16:28,278
Well, it's a thought.

364
00:16:28,383 --> 00:16:30,105
I was hoping for something
a little more inspiring,

365
00:16:30,205 --> 00:16:31,187
but at least you're thinking.

366
00:16:31,293 --> 00:16:32,601
Rest of you people,
slam your fucking brains

367
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:33,563
against your desks

368
00:16:33,662 --> 00:16:36,149
until something useful comes out.

369
00:16:36,253 --> 00:16:38,075
That was awesome.

370
00:16:38,173 --> 00:16:39,155
Thank you.

371
00:16:39,261 --> 00:16:41,170
Nick, you've been summoned.

372
00:16:41,277 --> 00:16:42,226
Captain wants to see you.

373
00:16:42,332 --> 00:16:43,609
<i>He saw the Joan show.</i>

374
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:44,754
What'd he think?

375
00:16:44,859 --> 00:16:46,583
Get your ass on the next flight
to Winston-Salem.

376
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,834
<i>Most people have this image
in their heads</i>

377
00:16:51,931 --> 00:16:53,939
<i>of tobacco executives
jet-setting around the world</i>

378
00:16:54,043 --> 00:16:56,147
<i>on private planes,
eating foie gras</i>

379
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,559
<i>as they count their money.</i>

380
00:16:57,659 --> 00:16:59,698
<i>Not me.</i>

381
00:16:59,801 --> 00:17:02,006
<i>I like to ride with the people.</i>

382
00:17:02,106 --> 00:17:03,568
<i>Know your clients.</i>

383
00:17:03,675 --> 00:17:05,778
<i>My people cram themselves
into a tiny seat,</i>

384
00:17:05,881 --> 00:17:07,669
<i>pop a Xanax and dream
of the moment</i>

385
00:17:07,768 --> 00:17:10,582
<i>they can stuff their face
with fresh tobacco.</i>

386
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,331
<i>If I can convince just one of
these kids to pick up smoking,</i>

387
00:17:13,431 --> 00:17:15,602
<i>I've paid for my flight-round-trip.</i>

388
00:17:23,702 --> 00:17:27,347
<i>The Captain is the last great
man of tobacco.</i>

389
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:29,103
<i>He introduced filters</i>

390
00:17:29,205 --> 00:17:32,521
<i>when cigarettes first got
slammed by Reader's Digest.</i>

391
00:17:32,629 --> 00:17:36,818
<i>Later, he founded
the Academy of Tobacco Studies.</i>

392
00:17:36,917 --> 00:17:39,667
<i>The club was founded
by the tobacco barons in 1890</i>

393
00:17:39,764 --> 00:17:43,059
<i>so they'd have a place
to get away from their wives.</i>

394
00:17:45,396 --> 00:17:48,777
<i>Here, the Captain is a legend-</i>

395
00:17:48,883 --> 00:17:51,119
<i>a self-made man who started
from nothing,</i>

396
00:17:51,218 --> 00:17:53,901
<i>and ended up with everything...</i>

397
00:17:54,002 --> 00:17:57,068
<i>except, evidently, a son.</i>

398
00:17:57,171 --> 00:17:59,308
Nick, my boy.

399
00:17:59,409 --> 00:18:02,377
You're just in time for mud.

400
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,008
Thank you.

401
00:18:04,113 --> 00:18:05,738
Sit down there. Yeah.

402
00:18:07,984 --> 00:18:10,090
Yeah.

403
00:18:10,193 --> 00:18:12,102
You know the secret
to a really good julep?

404
00:18:12,208 --> 00:18:13,833
No, sir.

405
00:18:13,936 --> 00:18:16,206
Well, you crush the mint

406
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:19,270
down onto the ice with your thumb

407
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,709
and you grind it in, see?

408
00:18:21,807 --> 00:18:24,327
And it releases the menthol.

409
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:26,818
Hmm.

410
00:18:26,926 --> 00:18:28,268
Now you know who taught me that?

411
00:18:28,366 --> 00:18:29,259
No, sir. Who?

412
00:18:29,357 --> 00:18:31,080
Fidel Castro.

413
00:18:35,372 --> 00:18:37,379
Do you remember 1952?

414
00:18:37,485 --> 00:18:40,582
Well, sir, I wasn't alive in 1952.

415
00:18:40,683 --> 00:18:45,222
Good Lord, I was in Korea
shooting Chinese in 1952.

416
00:18:45,323 --> 00:18:47,394
Really?

417
00:18:47,498 --> 00:18:49,670
Today they're our best customer.

418
00:18:49,771 --> 00:18:52,290
Next time we won't have to shoot
so many of them, will we?

419
00:18:52,393 --> 00:18:54,052
No, sir.

420
00:18:54,155 --> 00:18:57,984
<i>1952 was the year
Reader's Digest</i>

421
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:00,839
nailed us with
the whole health aspect.

422
00:19:00,936 --> 00:19:03,326
As Churchill said,

423
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,604
that was perhaps the end
of our beginning.

424
00:19:05,705 --> 00:19:08,900
Tell me,

425
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,854
do you enjoy your current work, Nick?

426
00:19:10,951 --> 00:19:11,879
Yes, sir.

427
00:19:11,976 --> 00:19:13,350
It's challenging...

428
00:19:13,448 --> 00:19:16,895
If you can do tobacco,
you can do anything.

429
00:19:16,998 --> 00:19:19,715
Yes, sir, I like that.

430
00:19:19,815 --> 00:19:22,116
You know, Nick, you remind me

431
00:19:22,214 --> 00:19:24,354
just a little bit
of myself when I was your age.

432
00:19:24,453 --> 00:19:26,973
Well, thank you, sir.

433
00:19:27,077 --> 00:19:28,833
Like that Joan Lunden show you did.

434
00:19:28,933 --> 00:19:31,104
You could have given up,
cried, apologized,

435
00:19:31,204 --> 00:19:32,154
but you didn't.

436
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,116
You stayed loyal.

437
00:19:34,213 --> 00:19:38,882
And you gave it
to that son of a bitch good.

438
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,434
My pleasure.

439
00:19:44,451 --> 00:19:47,484
Now, BR's come under the idea

440
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:50,237
that we should start bribing
producers in Hollywood

441
00:19:50,339 --> 00:19:53,852
to make the actors smoke on screen.

442
00:19:53,955 --> 00:19:56,823
You know, like in the old days.

443
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,100
Say, that's, uh...

444
00:19:59,201 --> 00:20:01,372
that's a great idea.

445
00:20:01,472 --> 00:20:02,846
Mm-hmm.

446
00:20:02,944 --> 00:20:04,405
Smart man, that BR.

447
00:20:04,511 --> 00:20:05,974
Oh, yeah, yeah.

448
00:20:06,081 --> 00:20:07,542
And loyal.

449
00:20:26,364 --> 00:20:27,258
Yes, sir?

450
00:20:27,358 --> 00:20:29,145
Have a seat, Ron.

451
00:20:39,451 --> 00:20:43,673
You, see, Ron, I can't be
everywhere I'm needed.

452
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:45,593
That's why I send
people like you

453
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:46,967
to speak on my behalf.

454
00:20:47,067 --> 00:20:50,579
When you're there,
you're not Ron Goode,

455
00:20:50,681 --> 00:20:52,569
the guy your friends probably like,

456
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,120
you're Senator Finistirre's aide,

457
00:20:55,225 --> 00:20:58,355
and your name really doesn't matter.

458
00:20:58,456 --> 00:21:00,280
So, when

459
00:21:00,376 --> 00:21:02,961
Ron Goode acts
like a complete asshole

460
00:21:03,064 --> 00:21:05,649
<i>on the Joan Lunden Show,</i>

461
00:21:05,752 --> 00:21:08,718
<i>I am being an asshole
on the Joan Lunden Show.</i>

462
00:21:08,823 --> 00:21:10,416
Senator, sir, he sprang on me like...

463
00:21:10,518 --> 00:21:13,584
Where in the hell
did you find cancer boy?

464
00:21:13,687 --> 00:21:16,021
He was supposed to be quite reliable.

465
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,835
The Pulmonary Council
was one of his references.

466
00:21:18,934 --> 00:21:20,560
Fucking nonprofits.

467
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,768
When you're looking
for a cancer kid,

468
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,113
he should be hopeless.

469
00:21:28,213 --> 00:21:29,707
He should have a wheelchair.

470
00:21:29,813 --> 00:21:31,885
He should have trouble talking.

471
00:21:31,987 --> 00:21:34,605
He should have
a little pet goldfish

472
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,236
he carries around
in a ziplock bag-

473
00:21:36,339 --> 00:21:37,353
hopeless.

474
00:21:37,459 --> 00:21:39,631
I apologize, sir, but if it wasn't

475
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,008
- for Nick Naylor...
- Nick Naylor?

476
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:47,024
Don't you even think
of using him as an excuse.

477
00:21:47,122 --> 00:21:49,031
The man shills bullshit for a living.

478
00:21:49,138 --> 00:21:51,025
You work for a fucking senator.

479
00:21:51,122 --> 00:21:53,293
A senator who is supposed
to be tough on tobacco.

480
00:21:53,393 --> 00:21:56,144
Have a little... pride,
for God's sake.

481
00:21:56,242 --> 00:22:00,298
It won't happen again, sir,
I promise.

482
00:22:02,832 --> 00:22:06,214
All right, you're excused.

483
00:22:11,855 --> 00:22:13,131
<i>Sometimes I feel like</i>

484
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:15,815
a Colombian drug dealer.

485
00:22:17,551 --> 00:22:21,925
The other day, my own granddaughter,
flesh of flesh of my own loins,

486
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:25,259
asked me, "Granddaddy, is it true

487
00:22:25,358 --> 00:22:28,106
cigarettes are bad for you?"

488
00:22:30,411 --> 00:22:32,867
We got to do something, Nick.

489
00:22:32,971 --> 00:22:34,183
I think you're our man.

490
00:22:34,283 --> 00:22:35,941
Thank you, sir.

491
00:22:36,043 --> 00:22:38,214
I want you to work
on this Hollywood project.

492
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,703
Get out there the next
few weeks, stir things up

493
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:44,585
and report directly to me.

494
00:22:44,682 --> 00:22:45,696
Sir, about the,

495
00:22:45,802 --> 00:22:48,736
the $50 million.

496
00:22:48,842 --> 00:22:51,624
Anti teen-smoking advertising.

497
00:22:51,722 --> 00:22:55,069
Well, shit, I sure hope
it's not too persuasive.

498
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,761
I hope.

499
00:23:08,808 --> 00:23:09,701
Nick,

500
00:23:09,798 --> 00:23:11,587
you're family now.

501
00:23:11,687 --> 00:23:14,206
Tobacco takes care of its own, eh?

502
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:16,165
Thank you, sir.

503
00:23:28,548 --> 00:23:29,441
Mr. Naylor?

504
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,488
Hi.

505
00:23:30,596 --> 00:23:31,971
Hi. Welcome to Tobacco One.

506
00:23:32,069 --> 00:23:33,279
Thank you.

507
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,900
The captain told me to take
extra special care of you today.

508
00:23:36,004 --> 00:23:38,338
So if there is anything
at all I can do

509
00:23:38,435 --> 00:23:39,644
to make your flight
more pleasant,

510
00:23:39,747 --> 00:23:42,879
you be sure and let me know now.

511
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,607
BR.

512
00:23:55,712 --> 00:23:56,573
Pleasant flight?

513
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:58,678
Oh! You could say that.

514
00:23:58,784 --> 00:24:00,474
Came up on the Captain's plane.

515
00:24:00,575 --> 00:24:02,397
Oh, it's quite the way to travel.

516
00:24:02,495 --> 00:24:04,283
I wouldn't know.

517
00:24:04,382 --> 00:24:05,594
No? You never been on Tobacco One

518
00:24:05,696 --> 00:24:08,793
with those seats, that kitchen,

519
00:24:08,895 --> 00:24:10,488
that stewardess, Tiffany?

520
00:24:10,591 --> 00:24:12,533
Haven't had the chance yet.

521
00:24:12,638 --> 00:24:13,882
Oh, well, you really must try it.

522
00:24:13,983 --> 00:24:15,957
It's the only way to travel.

523
00:24:16,062 --> 00:24:19,160
What'd he think of your $50 million
anti-smoking campaign?

524
00:24:19,261 --> 00:24:21,116
Oh, the $50 million
anti teen-smoking campaign?

525
00:24:21,214 --> 00:24:22,075
Yeah.

526
00:24:22,174 --> 00:24:23,286
Yeah, he gave that the go-ahead.

527
00:24:23,388 --> 00:24:24,501
Oh, and he loved your idea

528
00:24:24,605 --> 00:24:25,849
to put cigarettes back into movies.

529
00:24:25,949 --> 00:24:28,402
- That was your idea.
- Oh, yeah?

530
00:24:28,507 --> 00:24:30,547
- He must have gotten confused.
- Hmm.

531
00:24:30,651 --> 00:24:34,874
Yeah. Well, either way,
he was pretty blown away.

532
00:24:34,971 --> 00:24:37,523
Right. Well, get a flight to L.A.

533
00:24:37,627 --> 00:24:38,674
I'll get you a meeting
with Jeff Megall.

534
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:39,761
Who?

535
00:24:39,866 --> 00:24:41,076
Hollywood super agent.

536
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:44,691
Runs the agency EGO:
Entertainment Global Offices.

537
00:24:44,793 --> 00:24:46,287
<i>This guy is the entertainment business.</i>

538
00:24:46,393 --> 00:24:48,564
And you are cigarettes, BR.

539
00:24:48,664 --> 00:24:50,453
Whatever.

540
00:24:51,993 --> 00:24:54,032
Yeah, but it's not a vacation,
it's a learning experience.

541
00:24:54,137 --> 00:24:56,112
And California is one
of the fastest-growing

542
00:24:56,216 --> 00:24:57,361
states, it's got

543
00:24:57,463 --> 00:24:59,089
the largest number of electoral
votes in the country.

544
00:24:59,192 --> 00:25:01,874
I mean, this could be
a very good trip for Joey.

545
00:25:01,975 --> 00:25:03,251
You know what?
Don't smooth-talk me.

546
00:25:03,351 --> 00:25:04,299
You're not going to
take him sightseeing.

547
00:25:04,407 --> 00:25:05,422
You're probably going

548
00:25:05,528 --> 00:25:07,436
to take him
to some lung cancer symposium

549
00:25:07,543 --> 00:25:09,398
where a guy with an electronic
voice box will tell him

550
00:25:09,495 --> 00:25:10,606
that his father is the devil.

551
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,823
That's unfair.

552
00:25:11,926 --> 00:25:13,170
Unfair? What about Virginia?

553
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:14,578
And what about Virginia?

554
00:25:14,677 --> 00:25:16,366
You took him to a cigarette factory.

555
00:25:16,468 --> 00:25:18,258
No, I took him to a tobacco farm.

556
00:25:18,357 --> 00:25:19,503
That's hardly the same thing.

557
00:25:19,606 --> 00:25:21,514
This conversation's over.

558
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:27,241
Oh, fuck.

559
00:25:27,412 --> 00:25:29,965
Last week we had another
disgruntled postman.

560
00:25:30,068 --> 00:25:31,015
Of course,

561
00:25:31,123 --> 00:25:32,235
<i>an hour later the Washington Post</i>

562
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:35,023
is calling me on the phone-
godless swine.

563
00:25:35,123 --> 00:25:36,584
I said to 'em, I says,

564
00:25:36,691 --> 00:25:40,552
"Now if a plane crashes
on account of pilot error,

565
00:25:40,658 --> 00:25:41,967
do you blame the Boeing Corporation?"

566
00:25:42,066 --> 00:25:43,014
Nice.

567
00:25:43,122 --> 00:25:44,430
- That's a good one.
- Thank you.

568
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:46,985
If some booze-besotten drunk
runs someone down,

569
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:48,944
do you go banging on the doors
at General Motors?

570
00:25:49,041 --> 00:25:50,316
Tell me you didn't say that.

571
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:51,726
Mm-hmm.

572
00:25:51,825 --> 00:25:53,734
Have either of you heard of a
reporter named Heather Holloway?

573
00:25:53,841 --> 00:25:56,872
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Irish type.

574
00:25:56,975 --> 00:25:58,284
Brown hair, big blue eyes.

575
00:25:58,383 --> 00:25:59,431
Nice skin.

576
00:25:59,536 --> 00:26:00,516
Amazing tits.

577
00:26:00,623 --> 00:26:03,274
Tits? Why are tits relevant?

578
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:04,651
Hmm, let's see.

579
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:07,401
World-class tits on a reporter
interviewing a man

580
00:26:07,502 --> 00:26:10,218
with privileged information
are relevant.

581
00:26:10,317 --> 00:26:12,227
How about it, Nick?
Are you a tit man?

582
00:26:12,334 --> 00:26:14,058
Don't answer that.
That's a trap.

583
00:26:14,157 --> 00:26:16,840
Depends whose tits.

584
00:26:16,941 --> 00:26:18,665
Look, just don't get screwed,
all right?

585
00:26:18,765 --> 00:26:21,612
Bobby, I think I can handle
a good-looking girl reporter.

586
00:26:21,709 --> 00:26:23,269
Thank you.

587
00:26:32,108 --> 00:26:33,089
Heather Holloway.

588
00:26:33,195 --> 00:26:34,852
Nick Naylor, big tobacco.

589
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:38,596
Is this kosher?

590
00:26:38,698 --> 00:26:40,552
Only if I can call you "Heather."

591
00:26:40,649 --> 00:26:42,821
By all means.

592
00:26:45,321 --> 00:26:46,269
So, Mr. Naylor...

593
00:26:46,377 --> 00:26:48,383
- Nick.
- Nick.

594
00:26:48,488 --> 00:26:50,429
Let's start with...

595
00:26:50,536 --> 00:26:51,813
An '82 Margaux.

596
00:26:51,913 --> 00:26:53,854
Okay. Is it good?

597
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,255
Good? It'll make you believe in God.

598
00:27:10,437 --> 00:27:12,826
So what is the focus of your piece?

599
00:27:12,933 --> 00:27:14,689
- You.
- Really?

600
00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:16,545
You want to know how I live
with myself.

601
00:27:16,644 --> 00:27:20,222
No. I don't imagine
that's much of a problem.

602
00:27:20,324 --> 00:27:22,462
I want to know how you see yourself.

603
00:27:22,564 --> 00:27:23,709
I'm...

604
00:27:23,812 --> 00:27:26,462
a mediator between two sects
of society

605
00:27:26,564 --> 00:27:28,188
that are trying
to reach an accommodation.

606
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:30,081
Interesting.

607
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:33,691
My other interviews have pinned
you as a mass murderer,

608
00:27:33,795 --> 00:27:36,729
bloodsucker, pimp,
profiteer, child killer,

609
00:27:36,835 --> 00:27:39,966
and my personal favorite
"yuppie Mephistopheles."

610
00:27:40,066 --> 00:27:43,065
Wow, that sounds
like a balanced article.

611
00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:45,144
Who else should I talk to?

612
00:27:45,249 --> 00:27:47,288
55 million American smokers,
for starters

613
00:27:47,392 --> 00:27:50,142
or perhaps
the American tobacco farmer

614
00:27:50,239 --> 00:27:52,279
who is constantly being treated
like a drug smuggler.

615
00:27:52,383 --> 00:27:53,726
I actually do plan on speaking
to a tobacco farmer.

616
00:27:53,824 --> 00:27:54,772
Good.

617
00:27:54,879 --> 00:27:56,853
They're fine people,
salt of the earth.

618
00:27:56,959 --> 00:27:59,261
Nick, why do you do this?

619
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,952
What motivates you?

620
00:28:07,197 --> 00:28:09,204
You really want to know?

621
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,422
Mm-hmm.

622
00:28:10,526 --> 00:28:11,508
Really?

623
00:28:11,613 --> 00:28:13,336
Mm-hmm.

624
00:28:13,437 --> 00:28:17,877
Population control.

625
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,707
You're bad.

626
00:28:25,052 --> 00:28:27,091
Everyone's got a mortgage to pay.

627
00:28:27,196 --> 00:28:29,334
<i>The yuppie Nuremberg defense.</i>

628
00:28:29,434 --> 00:28:32,815
So is a mortgage that much
of a life goal?

629
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:37,043
Well, 99% of everything done
in the world, good or bad,

630
00:28:37,144 --> 00:28:39,566
is done to pay a mortgage,
so perhaps the world

631
00:28:39,672 --> 00:28:41,614
would be a better place
if everyone rented.

632
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:43,727
Then why don't you rent?

633
00:28:43,832 --> 00:28:45,555
Mm. Well, I rent as well.

634
00:28:45,655 --> 00:28:47,061
- Really?
- Yeah.

635
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:49,330
My son and his mother
and her boyfriend

636
00:28:49,431 --> 00:28:50,357
live in my house.

637
00:28:50,453 --> 00:28:51,534
I live in my apartment.

638
00:28:51,638 --> 00:28:54,987
What does Nick Naylor's
apartment look like?

639
00:28:55,094 --> 00:28:57,428
I don't know.
It's nothing impressive.

640
00:28:57,525 --> 00:28:58,834
It wouldn't make
the real estate section.

641
00:28:59,894 --> 00:29:01,584
Can I see it?

642
00:29:04,116 --> 00:29:05,774
You want to see my apartment?

643
00:29:05,876 --> 00:29:08,657
I'd like to see
where the devil sleeps.

644
00:29:14,706 --> 00:29:16,746
<i>I know what
you're probably thinking.</i>

645
00:29:19,219 --> 00:29:21,257
<i>This is a bad idea, right?</i>

646
00:29:23,891 --> 00:29:25,450
<i>I mean, come on.</i>

647
00:29:25,554 --> 00:29:26,600
<i>It's not that bad of an idea.</i>

648
00:29:40,656 --> 00:29:42,150
Mom, why can't I go

649
00:29:42,254 --> 00:29:44,228
to California?

650
00:29:44,334 --> 00:29:47,630
Because California's
just not a... safe place.

651
00:29:47,727 --> 00:29:50,147
And besides,
I'm not sure it's appropriate

652
00:29:50,254 --> 00:29:53,353
for your father to bring you
on a business trip.

653
00:29:53,453 --> 00:29:54,827
Appropriate for who?

654
00:29:54,924 --> 00:29:56,812
What?

655
00:29:56,909 --> 00:29:59,113
Mom, is it possible that
you're taking the frustration

656
00:29:59,213 --> 00:30:01,001
of your failed marriage out on me?

657
00:30:02,029 --> 00:30:04,395
Excuse me?

658
00:30:04,492 --> 00:30:06,663
This California trip seems like
a great learning opportunity

659
00:30:06,764 --> 00:30:09,446
and a chance for me
to get to know my father.

660
00:30:09,547 --> 00:30:11,206
But if you think it's more important

661
00:30:11,308 --> 00:30:13,096
to use me to channel your frustration

662
00:30:13,195 --> 00:30:15,017
against the man you no longer love,

663
00:30:15,115 --> 00:30:16,708
I'll understand.

664
00:30:21,546 --> 00:30:23,400
How'd you convince her?

665
00:30:23,498 --> 00:30:25,603
It was an argument,
not a negotiation.

666
00:30:25,705 --> 00:30:27,266
That's my boy.

667
00:31:11,683 --> 00:31:13,275
Nick?

668
00:31:13,378 --> 00:31:15,418
Nick, Jack, Jeff's assistant. Hey.

669
00:31:15,523 --> 00:31:17,693
How was your flight?
Are you jet-lagged at all?

670
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:19,420
It's, like, 2:00 in D.C.
right now.

671
00:31:19,523 --> 00:31:20,929
You know what?
Take some vitamin B.

672
00:31:21,025 --> 00:31:22,202
Jeff swears by it- in fact,

673
00:31:22,305 --> 00:31:23,899
I'm gonna hook you up
with an injection.

674
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,343
Who's this with you?
How are you, dude? What's going on?

675
00:31:25,441 --> 00:31:26,487
You guys ever been to L.A. before?

676
00:31:26,592 --> 00:31:28,348
You want to head back
to Jeffs office?

677
00:31:28,448 --> 00:31:30,718
In fact, we probably should-
He's a punctual being.

678
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:33,533
We actually had some problems at first
with the exterior mirrored glass.

679
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:36,086
The reflection of the sun was causing
head-on collisions on Wilshire.

680
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:37,718
Oh, is everybody all right?

681
00:31:37,823 --> 00:31:39,896
Yeah, they got three-picture deals
at Paramount- I'm sure they'll live.

682
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:41,176
- It's a nice building.
- Yeah?

683
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:43,067
Hey, tell Jeff you think so, okay?

684
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:45,589
'Cause he just put a lot
of himself into this building.

685
00:31:45,694 --> 00:31:48,989
And you know something?
It really shows.

686
00:31:49,086 --> 00:31:50,580
What's up, Hiroshi?

687
00:31:50,685 --> 00:31:54,297
Keep going- that sand's
not gonna rake itself.

688
00:31:54,397 --> 00:31:56,338
All right, come here,
this is my favorite part.

689
00:31:56,444 --> 00:31:59,543
That one right there?
It's $7,000.

690
00:31:59,645 --> 00:32:01,586
- $7,000 for a fish?
- Yep.

691
00:32:01,692 --> 00:32:03,514
Kind of makes you want
to stop eating sushi,

692
00:32:03,612 --> 00:32:05,172
but I guess you kind of have to.

693
00:32:05,275 --> 00:32:07,031
Hey, you see that
big white one right there?

694
00:32:07,131 --> 00:32:09,782
Swear to you- $12,000,
gift from Oprah.

695
00:32:09,884 --> 00:32:13,528
It's a Chamberlain- office-warming gift
from Matthew McConaughey.

696
00:32:13,627 --> 00:32:14,935
Generous gift.

697
00:32:15,034 --> 00:32:16,976
Yeah. Right!

698
00:32:17,081 --> 00:32:19,798
Don't get me wrong, Matthew is
a tremendously talented individual

699
00:32:19,898 --> 00:32:21,327
and an extremely decent human being,

700
00:32:21,433 --> 00:32:23,855
however, before Jeff
took him on, he was a face.

701
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,138
Now he's a name.

702
00:32:28,633 --> 00:32:31,414
Do you hear that?

703
00:32:34,518 --> 00:32:35,796
No.

704
00:32:36,824 --> 00:32:38,962
Exactly.

705
00:32:47,478 --> 00:32:48,787
Hey, Neal.

706
00:32:48,886 --> 00:32:51,057
Neal, I'm gonna impale
your mom on a spike,

707
00:32:51,157 --> 00:32:53,711
and I'm gonna feed her dead body
to my dog with syphilis.

708
00:32:53,813 --> 00:32:55,503
Aw, Jack, you got me!

709
00:32:55,605 --> 00:32:57,198
That guy!

710
00:32:57,301 --> 00:32:59,885
It's an inside joke.

711
00:32:59,987 --> 00:33:02,159
So, as you can see,

712
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,363
Jeff just really loves Asian shit.

713
00:33:04,466 --> 00:33:06,125
Uh, Candace, is he ready?

714
00:33:06,227 --> 00:33:07,821
- Mm-hmm.
- Fantastic.

715
00:33:07,923 --> 00:33:10,093
Okay, Joey,
I'm gonna bring your dad in now.

716
00:33:10,194 --> 00:33:12,136
Is there anything I can get
you while you're waiting,

717
00:33:12,242 --> 00:33:14,346
like an orange juice
or a coffee or a Red Bull?

718
00:33:14,449 --> 00:33:16,752
- No, thanks.
- Okay.

719
00:33:19,153 --> 00:33:21,041
Wow, it's a great office.

720
00:33:21,137 --> 00:33:23,046
Yeah. Jeff basically designed
the whole thing.

721
00:33:23,153 --> 00:33:24,975
The architect just made the drawings.

722
00:33:25,073 --> 00:33:27,342
Jack, stop it.

723
00:33:27,441 --> 00:33:28,683
Next you're gonna be telling him

724
00:33:28,783 --> 00:33:30,212
what position I played
for the Bruins.

725
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,181
Quarterback.

726
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,490
Jeff Megall.

727
00:33:32,592 --> 00:33:33,769
Nick Naylor.

728
00:33:33,871 --> 00:33:36,009
Mr. Naylor's here to see
if we can't get cigarettes

729
00:33:36,111 --> 00:33:38,532
- into the hands of somebody
other than the usual RAVs.
- Sure.

730
00:33:38,638 --> 00:33:41,027
- RAVs?
- Russians, Arabs and Villains.

731
00:33:41,135 --> 00:33:42,792
Oh, well, then yes, I guess
that is why I'm here.

732
00:33:42,894 --> 00:33:44,999
Good. I think we can help.

733
00:33:45,102 --> 00:33:47,109
Jeff invented product placement.

734
00:33:47,213 --> 00:33:49,100
I feel I have to ask, uh...

735
00:33:49,197 --> 00:33:52,066
Are you concerned at
all about the, um...

736
00:33:52,173 --> 00:33:53,667
about the health element?

737
00:33:53,773 --> 00:33:56,521
I'm not a doctor, I'm a facilitator.

738
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,830
I bring creative people together.

739
00:33:57,931 --> 00:34:00,036
Whatever information there is,
exists, it's out there.

740
00:34:00,139 --> 00:34:01,284
People will decide for themselves.

741
00:34:01,388 --> 00:34:03,722
They should. It's not
my role to decide for them.

742
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,642
It'd be morally presumptuous.

743
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:08,193
<i>I could learn a lot
from this man.</i>

744
00:34:08,298 --> 00:34:10,567
Now, what we need is
a smoking role model,

745
00:34:10,666 --> 00:34:11,560
a real winner.

746
00:34:11,658 --> 00:34:13,283
Indiana Jones meets Jerry Maguire.

747
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:14,399
Right, on two packs a day.

748
00:34:14,505 --> 00:34:16,447
Only he can't live
in contemporary society.

749
00:34:16,553 --> 00:34:17,414
Why not?

750
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,422
The health issue's way too prevalent.

751
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:21,384
People would constantly
be asking the character

752
00:34:21,482 --> 00:34:23,652
why he's smoking-
and that should go unsaid.

753
00:34:23,753 --> 00:34:25,607
How do you feel about the future?

754
00:34:25,704 --> 00:34:27,809
The future?

755
00:34:27,912 --> 00:34:29,570
Yeah, after the health thing's
blown over.

756
00:34:29,672 --> 00:34:30,948
A world
where smokers and nonsmokers

757
00:34:31,048 --> 00:34:32,388
live together in perfect harmony.

758
00:34:32,486 --> 00:34:34,756
Sony has a futuristic sci-fi movie
they're looking to make.

759
00:34:34,854 --> 00:34:36,709
<i>Message From Sector Six.</i>

760
00:34:36,806 --> 00:34:38,748
All takes place in a space station.

761
00:34:38,854 --> 00:34:40,642
They're actively looking
for some cofinancing.

762
00:34:40,742 --> 00:34:42,148
So cigarettes in space?

763
00:34:42,245 --> 00:34:44,285
It's the final frontier, Nick.

764
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:46,298
But wouldn't they blow up
in an all-oxygen environment?

765
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:48,991
Probably.

766
00:34:49,093 --> 00:34:51,580
But it's an easy fix-
one line of dialogue:

767
00:34:51,685 --> 00:34:53,572
"Thank God we invented the..."
you know,

768
00:34:53,669 --> 00:34:54,912
whatever device.

769
00:34:55,012 --> 00:34:56,800
Brad Pitt.

770
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,394
Catherine Zeta-Jones.

771
00:34:58,499 --> 00:34:59,842
They've just finished ravishing

772
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,427
each other's bodies
for the first time.

773
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:04,472
They lie naked, suspended in air

774
00:35:04,579 --> 00:35:05,952
underneath the heavens.

775
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:08,320
Pitt lights up.

776
00:35:08,418 --> 00:35:10,076
He starts blowing smoke rings
all around

777
00:35:10,178 --> 00:35:11,900
Catherine's naked, flawless body,

778
00:35:12,001 --> 00:35:15,035
as the galaxies go whizzing
by over the glass-domed ceiling.

779
00:35:15,138 --> 00:35:17,112
Now, tell me that
doesn't work for you.

780
00:35:17,217 --> 00:35:18,461
I'd see that movie.

781
00:35:18,561 --> 00:35:19,772
I'd buy the goddamn DVD.

782
00:35:19,873 --> 00:35:22,458
You know, if the academy
didn't send them to me for free.

783
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,966
You know,

784
00:35:24,064 --> 00:35:26,135
you guys ought to think
about designing a cigarette

785
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:27,897
to be released simultaneously
with the movie.

786
00:35:27,999 --> 00:35:29,494
Sector Sixes.

787
00:35:29,601 --> 00:35:31,094
No one's ever done it
with a cigarette.

788
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:32,278
Wow.

789
00:35:32,382 --> 00:35:34,204
Well, where do we go from here?

790
00:35:34,302 --> 00:35:37,019
You enjoy the rest of your day
in L.A. with your son

791
00:35:37,118 --> 00:35:38,974
while I find out
the answers to these questions.

792
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,590
Hey, where can I get
a bite to eat with my son?

793
00:35:41,694 --> 00:35:43,155
You ought to try Nobu's new place.

794
00:35:43,262 --> 00:35:45,563
- He only serves food that's white.
- Oh, great.

795
00:35:46,781 --> 00:35:48,919
<i>So, you go to an office,</i>

796
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,541
<i>then you go on TV
and talk about cigarettes.</i>

797
00:35:51,645 --> 00:35:53,400
<i>Then you fly out to L.A.</i>

798
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,865
to talk to some guy who
works with movie stars.

799
00:35:55,964 --> 00:35:59,127
- What is that?
- That's my job; I'm a lobbyist.

800
00:35:59,227 --> 00:36:01,780
I know, but did you study to do that?

801
00:36:01,883 --> 00:36:04,271
No. No, I just kind of figured it out.

802
00:36:04,377 --> 00:36:06,385
Then can't anyone just do that?

803
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:10,263
No, it, uh, requires a...

804
00:36:10,361 --> 00:36:13,939
a moral flexibility
that goes beyond most people.

805
00:36:15,001 --> 00:36:17,718
Do I have flexible morals?

806
00:36:17,816 --> 00:36:20,402
Well, let's say
you became a lawyer, right?

807
00:36:20,504 --> 00:36:22,064
And you were asked
to defend a murderer.

808
00:36:22,168 --> 00:36:23,629
Worse than that- a child murderer.

809
00:36:23,736 --> 00:36:24,979
Now,

810
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:27,948
the law states that every person
deserves a fair trial.

811
00:36:28,055 --> 00:36:30,061
Would you defend them?

812
00:36:30,166 --> 00:36:31,793
I don't know.
I guess every person

813
00:36:31,894 --> 00:36:33,650
- deserves a fair defense.
- Yeah, well,

814
00:36:33,751 --> 00:36:35,791
so do multinational corporations.

815
00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:39,057
So, what happens when you're wrong?

816
00:36:39,158 --> 00:36:40,751
Well, Joey, I'm never wrong.

817
00:36:40,854 --> 00:36:42,260
But you can't always be right.

818
00:36:42,357 --> 00:36:45,172
Well, if it's your job to be right,
then you're never wrong.

819
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:47,374
<i>But what if you are wrong?</i>

820
00:36:47,477 --> 00:36:49,549
Okay, let's say that
you're defending chocolate

821
00:36:49,652 --> 00:36:50,929
and I'm defending vanilla.

822
00:36:51,029 --> 00:36:53,330
Now, if I were to say to you,

823
00:36:53,428 --> 00:36:56,209
"Vanilla's the best flavor
ice cream," you'd say...?

824
00:36:56,307 --> 00:36:58,281
- "No, chocolate is."
- Exactly.

825
00:36:58,386 --> 00:36:59,913
But you can't win that argument.

826
00:37:00,018 --> 00:37:02,473
So, I'll ask you-
So you think chocolate

827
00:37:02,578 --> 00:37:05,261
is the end-all and be-all
of ice cream, do you?

828
00:37:05,362 --> 00:37:07,336
It's the best ice cream;
I wouldn't order any other.

829
00:37:07,442 --> 00:37:09,264
Oh. So it's all chocolate
for you, is it?

830
00:37:09,362 --> 00:37:10,889
Yes, chocolate is all I need.

831
00:37:10,994 --> 00:37:12,237
Well, I need more than chocolate.

832
00:37:12,337 --> 00:37:14,246
And for that matter,
I need more than vanilla.

833
00:37:14,353 --> 00:37:16,043
I believe that we need
freedom and choice

834
00:37:16,145 --> 00:37:18,533
when it comes to our ice cream,
and that, Joey Naylor,

835
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,101
that is the definition of liberty.

836
00:37:20,208 --> 00:37:22,062
But that's not what
we're talking about.

837
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,461
<i>Ah, but that's what
I'm talking about.</i>

838
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,374
- But... you didn't prove that vanilla's the best.
- I didn't have to.

839
00:37:27,471 --> 00:37:30,187
I proved that you're wrong-
and if you're wrong, I'm right.

840
00:37:30,287 --> 00:37:31,215
But you still didn't

841
00:37:31,311 --> 00:37:32,324
convince me.

842
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:33,707
'Cause I'm not after you.

843
00:37:33,806 --> 00:37:36,969
I'm after them.

844
00:37:52,396 --> 00:37:53,802
Hello?

845
00:37:53,898 --> 00:37:55,722
Thought I'd give you a little update.

846
00:37:55,819 --> 00:37:57,707
Jeff. You still at the office?

847
00:37:57,802 --> 00:38:00,224
Do you know what time it is
in Tokyo right now?

848
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:02,021
- No.
- 4:00 P.M. tomorrow.

849
00:38:02,122 --> 00:38:03,845
It's the future, Nick.

850
00:38:05,002 --> 00:38:06,659
Anyway, for Pitt to smoke,

851
00:38:06,762 --> 00:38:08,901
it's $10 million;
for the pair, it's 25.

852
00:38:09,001 --> 00:38:12,033
25?! Usually when I buy two
of something, I get a discount.

853
00:38:12,136 --> 00:38:13,282
What's the extra five for?

854
00:38:13,385 --> 00:38:14,497
Synergy.

855
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,250
These are not stupid people;
they got it right away.

856
00:38:17,352 --> 00:38:19,491
Pitt and Zeta-Jones lighting up
after some cosmic fucking

857
00:38:19,593 --> 00:38:21,958
in the bubble suite's
gonna sell a lot of cigarettes.

858
00:38:22,055 --> 00:38:23,430
Well, for that kind of money,

859
00:38:23,528 --> 00:38:25,349
my people will expect
some very serious smoking.

860
00:38:25,447 --> 00:38:26,876
Can Brad blow smoke rings?

861
00:38:26,983 --> 00:38:28,324
I don't have that information.

862
00:38:28,423 --> 00:38:30,047
Well, for $25 million,
we'd want smoke rings.

863
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,580
Oh, one other thing-
you'll be cofinancing

864
00:38:31,686 --> 00:38:33,541
the picture
with the Sultan of Glutan.

865
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:34,783
The Sultan of Glutan?

866
00:38:34,885 --> 00:38:36,827
The one who massacred
and enslaved his own people?

867
00:38:36,933 --> 00:38:39,322
Aren't they calling him
the Hitler of the South Pacific?

868
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:41,762
No, I can't speak to that-
All my dealings with him,

869
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,520
he's been a very reasonable
and sensitive guy.

870
00:38:43,621 --> 00:38:44,798
He's fun. You'll like him.

871
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,045
I better run it by my people.

872
00:38:46,147 --> 00:38:47,196
No problem.

873
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,609
Oh, that's London calling.

874
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:50,747
7:00 A.M. in the Old Empire.

875
00:38:50,851 --> 00:38:52,345
Jeff, when do you sleep?

876
00:38:52,451 --> 00:38:53,630
Sunday.

877
00:39:53,211 --> 00:39:55,600
- Operator.
- Yeah, my light is blinking.

878
00:39:55,706 --> 00:39:58,805
- There's a package downstairs for you.
- Okay, send it up.

879
00:40:01,243 --> 00:40:04,308
Captain, I'm sitting in front
of an open briefcase.

880
00:40:04,409 --> 00:40:06,351
I don't suppose this is a raise.

881
00:40:06,457 --> 00:40:10,101
Now, Nick, do you know
who Lorne Lutch is?

882
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,825
Yeah, of course.
He's the original Marlboro Man.

883
00:40:11,928 --> 00:40:14,294
<i>He's dying.
He was on Sally last week.</i>

884
00:40:14,392 --> 00:40:16,497
Not exactly our biggest fan.

885
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,777
Well, the money's for him.

886
00:40:17,879 --> 00:40:20,400
Now, he has a ranch
out there in California.

887
00:40:20,503 --> 00:40:22,095
I want you to bring it to him.

888
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:25,875
He's a cowboy, sir,
and cowboys don't like bribes.

889
00:40:25,974 --> 00:40:28,046
It's not a bribe. No, sir.

890
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:30,801
You're going out there
on wings of angels, son.

891
00:40:30,902 --> 00:40:33,715
You mean we're just going
to give him the money?

892
00:40:33,813 --> 00:40:35,155
Well, I think Christ himself
would say,

893
00:40:35,253 --> 00:40:37,391
"That's mighty white of you boys."

894
00:40:37,492 --> 00:40:39,467
No gag agreement?

895
00:40:39,573 --> 00:40:41,873
Hopefully, he'll be so damn
overcome with gratitude

896
00:40:41,971 --> 00:40:44,208
<i>he'll... he'll have to shut up.</i>

897
00:40:54,514 --> 00:40:56,750
Hey, kiddo, I got to go do
a little bit more work

898
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:57,897
this afternoon, all right?

899
00:40:58,001 --> 00:40:58,864
Can I come?

900
00:40:58,962 --> 00:41:00,337
No. Not this time.

901
00:41:00,434 --> 00:41:02,506
But I want to see what you do.

902
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:43,651
You stay here, okay?

903
00:42:02,025 --> 00:42:04,480
What the fuck are you doing here?

904
00:42:04,585 --> 00:42:07,072
Uh... uh...

905
00:42:07,177 --> 00:42:08,803
Do you have a minute?

906
00:42:13,736 --> 00:42:15,328
What do you want?

907
00:42:15,431 --> 00:42:16,609
Dad!

908
00:42:16,712 --> 00:42:17,790
Joey, get back in the car.

909
00:42:24,133 --> 00:42:26,042
Just want to talk.

910
00:42:27,335 --> 00:42:29,308
All right.

911
00:42:29,414 --> 00:42:30,821
Let's talk.

912
00:42:46,563 --> 00:42:48,897
Pearl, we got company.

913
00:42:51,427 --> 00:42:54,492
Mister, you got a lot of nerve
walking in here after...

914
00:42:54,594 --> 00:42:57,822
Honey, why don't you show
this young man some iced tea?

915
00:43:00,834 --> 00:43:02,262
I'll be right back, tiger.

916
00:43:18,015 --> 00:43:20,470
Saw you on...

917
00:43:20,574 --> 00:43:23,923
Weren't you on that TV show?

918
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:26,714
Yeah. Yeah, that was me.

919
00:43:26,814 --> 00:43:30,228
You're lucky you made it
out of there alive.

920
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:32,537
Yeah. Tobacco used to be
all over the television.

921
00:43:32,637 --> 00:43:36,466
Now TV is leading the witch hunt.

922
00:43:36,573 --> 00:43:38,360
Strange business.

923
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:41,243
Last year, after I was diagnosed,

924
00:43:41,341 --> 00:43:46,641
flew east to attend the
annual stockholders' convention.

925
00:43:48,346 --> 00:43:50,234
Stood up and told them
I thought

926
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:54,770
they ought to cut back
on their advertising.

927
00:43:54,874 --> 00:43:57,361
You know what your boss said to me?

928
00:44:00,473 --> 00:44:03,407
He said, "We're certainly sorry

929
00:44:03,513 --> 00:44:07,124
"to hear about your medical problem.

930
00:44:07,225 --> 00:44:10,520
"However, without
knowing more

931
00:44:10,616 --> 00:44:14,127
"of your medical history,

932
00:44:14,231 --> 00:44:16,237
we can't comment further."

933
00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:20,849
But then they tried to pretend

934
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:22,608
I never worked for 'em.

935
00:44:24,469 --> 00:44:26,608
Yeah, I got the pay stubs.

936
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:29,360
But, hell,
I was on the damn billboards.

937
00:44:31,028 --> 00:44:32,686
I never
even smoked

938
00:44:32,788 --> 00:44:34,730
Marlboro.

939
00:44:34,837 --> 00:44:37,203
I smoked Kools.

940
00:44:41,427 --> 00:44:44,426
You look like a nice-enough fella.

941
00:44:44,531 --> 00:44:46,734
What are you doing
working for these assholes?

942
00:44:48,562 --> 00:44:50,536
I'm good at it.

943
00:44:50,641 --> 00:44:51,819
Better at doing this

944
00:44:51,922 --> 00:44:53,516
than I ever was
at doing anything else.

945
00:44:53,617 --> 00:44:55,472
Aw, hell, son.

946
00:44:55,569 --> 00:44:58,024
I was good at shooting VC.

947
00:44:58,129 --> 00:45:00,015
I didn't make it my career.

948
00:45:02,225 --> 00:45:05,736
I suppose we all
got to pay the mortgage.

949
00:45:09,424 --> 00:45:11,496
Your dad always bring
you along like this?

950
00:45:11,598 --> 00:45:14,217
No. I live with my mom.

951
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:15,975
He tell you why he's here today?

952
00:45:16,078 --> 00:45:19,755
He said that your husband
was the Marlboro Man.

953
00:45:21,293 --> 00:45:24,937
Yeah, well, not anymore.

954
00:45:25,037 --> 00:45:26,444
Hello.

955
00:45:26,541 --> 00:45:28,613
Yeah. Hey, can you hold on a second?

956
00:45:28,717 --> 00:45:32,644
You need anything else,
grab it out of the fridge.

957
00:45:32,749 --> 00:45:34,341
So I'm standing here
minding my own business,

958
00:45:34,443 --> 00:45:36,232
filling up pill bottles...

959
00:45:36,332 --> 00:45:41,994
So you're here to talk me
into shutting up?

960
00:45:43,785 --> 00:45:45,957
That what's in that case of yours?

961
00:45:46,058 --> 00:45:48,610
Yeah, basically.

962
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:51,112
No, not basically.

963
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:53,348
That's... that's exactly it.

964
00:45:55,369 --> 00:45:56,930
My dignity ain't for sale.

965
00:45:57,033 --> 00:45:59,399
It's not an offer.
It's a gift.

966
00:45:59,496 --> 00:46:00,576
Taxes have all been paid.

967
00:46:00,681 --> 00:46:03,298
You get to keep it
no matter what you do.

968
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,774
The idea is that, somehow,

969
00:46:04,872 --> 00:46:07,393
your guilt will prevent you
from bad-mouthing us.

970
00:46:07,496 --> 00:46:09,219
Are you supposed to be

971
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,945
telling me all that?

972
00:46:11,047 --> 00:46:13,468
No, sir. Just apologize,

973
00:46:13,573 --> 00:46:15,265
give you the money, and leave.

974
00:46:15,366 --> 00:46:17,058
<i>Why are you telling me this?</i>

975
00:46:19,493 --> 00:46:21,381
Because, this way,
you'll take the money.

976
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:22,687
Why would I do that?

977
00:46:22,789 --> 00:46:23,737
Because you're mad.

978
00:46:23,844 --> 00:46:25,219
Damn straight I am.

979
00:46:25,317 --> 00:46:26,265
The first thing you'll do,

980
00:46:26,373 --> 00:46:28,380
<i>is you'll call the L.A. Times,
and CNN...</i>

981
00:46:28,483 --> 00:46:29,826
- Huh?
- and insist on Bonnie Carlton.

982
00:46:29,924 --> 00:46:30,786
She does really good

983
00:46:30,885 --> 00:46:31,746
controlled outrage.

984
00:46:31,845 --> 00:46:33,021
Tell them, "No Bonnie, no story."

985
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:34,106
Watch it on MSNBC.

986
00:46:34,212 --> 00:46:35,456
- Okay.
- When they get here,

987
00:46:35,555 --> 00:46:38,369
you open up the case...

988
00:46:40,963 --> 00:46:43,995
and you pour all the cash
out onto the floor.

989
00:46:44,097 --> 00:46:45,113
- Why?
- Trust me.

990
00:46:45,218 --> 00:46:46,364
It'll look more effective that way.

991
00:46:46,466 --> 00:46:50,360
Don't forget to shake
every last bundle out.

992
00:46:52,032 --> 00:46:53,625
If you can, you know,
give a cough or two.

993
00:46:53,729 --> 00:46:56,512
Once it's all
out on the floor,

994
00:46:56,610 --> 00:46:58,015
tell them what you're
going to do with it.

995
00:46:58,113 --> 00:46:59,040
<i>What am I going to do with it?</i>

996
00:46:59,136 --> 00:47:00,118
You're going to donate it.

997
00:47:00,224 --> 00:47:02,328
Yeah. Start the Lorne Lutch
Cancer Foundation.

998
00:47:02,431 --> 00:47:03,707
You're going to have
a ranch and a fair

999
00:47:03,807 --> 00:47:06,328
and a 5K.
A 5K is a must. Television...

1000
00:47:06,431 --> 00:47:07,413
Wait a minute.

1001
00:47:07,518 --> 00:47:09,658
What about my family?

1002
00:47:11,998 --> 00:47:14,103
But, Lorne, you can't keep the money.

1003
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:15,635
Why the hell not?

1004
00:47:15,742 --> 00:47:16,919
What do you mean?

1005
00:47:17,022 --> 00:47:19,510
Denounce us,
and then keep the blood money?

1006
00:47:19,613 --> 00:47:20,858
I mean, look at it.

1007
00:47:27,837 --> 00:47:28,698
I got to think this over.

1008
00:47:28,797 --> 00:47:29,625
Lorne, whoa.

1009
00:47:29,724 --> 00:47:31,633
News doesn't work that way.

1010
00:47:31,739 --> 00:47:33,681
You can't denounce us next week.

1011
00:47:40,027 --> 00:47:43,158
I don't suppose I can
denounce you for half of it.

1012
00:47:43,259 --> 00:47:46,486
No, Lorne. Either you keep
all the money,

1013
00:47:46,585 --> 00:47:49,237
or you... you give it all away.

1014
00:47:59,257 --> 00:48:01,329
Dad, how did you know

1015
00:48:01,432 --> 00:48:03,221
he would take the money?

1016
00:48:05,462 --> 00:48:08,246
You'd have to be crazy
to turn down all that money.

1017
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:10,709
When I saw he wasn't crazy,
I knew he'd take it.

1018
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:14,517
Would you have taken it?

1019
00:48:14,613 --> 00:48:17,069
If I were him? Sure.

1020
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:21,108
So would I.

1021
00:48:32,179 --> 00:48:33,194
I don't think you understand, sir.

1022
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:34,543
He's like a wild animal.

1023
00:48:34,642 --> 00:48:36,236
You'll have to be
on your guard at all times.

1024
00:48:36,339 --> 00:48:37,288
He has this trick.

1025
00:48:37,396 --> 00:48:38,540
Ron, shut up.

1026
00:48:38,643 --> 00:48:40,398
I've tangoed with presidents,
lawyers and Indian chiefs.

1027
00:48:40,498 --> 00:48:42,953
I think I can handle Mr. Nick Naylor.

1028
00:48:44,849 --> 00:48:45,994
All right, welcome back, kids.

1029
00:48:46,097 --> 00:48:47,919
We've got two guests
on the show tonight.

1030
00:48:48,017 --> 00:48:49,926
First, joining us
from our Washington studio...

1031
00:48:50,032 --> 00:48:51,887
I must have that tie clip!

1032
00:48:51,985 --> 00:48:54,472
...is the senator from
the great state of Vermont.

1033
00:48:54,576 --> 00:48:56,649
Please welcome Ortolan Finistirre.

1034
00:48:56,752 --> 00:48:57,612
Welcome, Senator.

1035
00:48:57,712 --> 00:48:59,206
Good to be here, Dennis.

1036
00:48:59,312 --> 00:49:00,937
And, joining us here
in our Los Angeles studio,

1037
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,828
he is the chief spokesperson

1038
00:49:02,927 --> 00:49:05,032
for the Academy of Tobacco Studies.

1039
00:49:05,136 --> 00:49:06,565
Quite an august chamber, might I add?

1040
00:49:06,671 --> 00:49:08,361
- Nick Naylor. Nick, welcome.
- Pleasure to be here.

1041
00:49:08,462 --> 00:49:11,081
All right, I understand you were
on Joan Lunden's show recently.

1042
00:49:11,182 --> 00:49:12,709
Didn't make a lot
of friends over there, did you?

1043
00:49:12,815 --> 00:49:14,123
I will say that I don't think

1044
00:49:14,222 --> 00:49:15,465
I'll be getting
my annual invitation

1045
00:49:15,565 --> 00:49:18,215
to the Finistirre Labor Day Barbecue.

1046
00:49:18,317 --> 00:49:20,619
Well, I continue to offer
an open invitation to Mr. Naylor

1047
00:49:20,717 --> 00:49:22,953
to join us in Congress
to talk about the inclusion

1048
00:49:23,053 --> 00:49:25,671
of our new poison label which,
if I might say...

1049
00:49:25,772 --> 00:49:27,843
Nick, ready to trek up
the Hill and testify

1050
00:49:27,947 --> 00:49:29,092
before Congress?

1051
00:49:29,195 --> 00:49:31,268
Well, I'd love to, Dennis,
but not as long as the senator

1052
00:49:31,372 --> 00:49:32,680
is calling for me to be fired.

1053
00:49:32,779 --> 00:49:34,982
It's not exactly
a welcome invitation.

1054
00:49:35,083 --> 00:49:37,503
Yeah. Bit of a mixed message,
Senator.

1055
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:39,782
Well, not as mixed as the stance
that Big Tobacco has taken

1056
00:49:39,882 --> 00:49:41,573
about the dangers
of smoking cigarettes.

1057
00:49:41,674 --> 00:49:43,048
- Oh, no.
- Now what are you laughing...?

1058
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,153
You're a wind-up artist.
Give the man his due.

1059
00:49:45,257 --> 00:49:46,981
He's got a bit of a point there,
doesn't he?

1060
00:49:47,082 --> 00:49:48,869
Sorry. I just can't
help myself, Dennis.

1061
00:49:48,969 --> 00:49:50,562
I... I... I'm just tickled by the idea

1062
00:49:50,665 --> 00:49:52,289
of the gentleman from Vermont

1063
00:49:52,392 --> 00:49:54,848
calling me a hypocrite
when, uh... this same man,

1064
00:49:54,952 --> 00:49:56,741
in one day, held a press
conference where he called

1065
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:59,229
for the American tobacco fields
to be slashed and burned,

1066
00:49:59,336 --> 00:50:00,863
then he jumped on a private jet

1067
00:50:00,967 --> 00:50:03,356
and flew down to Farm Aid
where he rode a tractor onstage

1068
00:50:03,462 --> 00:50:06,332
- Oh, come on.
- as he bemoaned the downfall
of the American farmer.

1069
00:50:06,439 --> 00:50:08,161
Care to comment, Senator?

1070
00:50:08,262 --> 00:50:10,117
He... I... No.

1071
00:50:10,214 --> 00:50:12,352
Eloquent in its brevity.

1072
00:50:12,453 --> 00:50:13,533
Emotional issue.

1073
00:50:13,637 --> 00:50:14,816
Let's take some phone calls now.

1074
00:50:14,917 --> 00:50:17,121
Herndon, Virginia.
Go ahead. You're on the show.

1075
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:19,610
Dennis, has anyone ever
announced that they're going

1076
00:50:19,716 --> 00:50:21,406
to kill someone live on your show?

1077
00:50:21,508 --> 00:50:24,607
My demo's been called quirky
but, no, at this point,

1078
00:50:24,708 --> 00:50:26,714
we're not skewing
to the emotionally unstable.

1079
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:28,860
Then it's your lucky day.

1080
00:50:28,963 --> 00:50:30,556
Because I'm here to tell
you that, within a week,

1081
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:33,147
we're going to dispatch
Mr. Naylor from this planet

1082
00:50:33,251 --> 00:50:36,795
for all the pain and suffering
he's caused in the world.

1083
00:50:40,418 --> 00:50:42,806
As I said, emotional issue.
We're going to break now.

1084
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:44,604
I got to fire a call screener.

1085
00:51:10,429 --> 00:51:11,835
Let's go.

1086
00:51:46,041 --> 00:51:48,594
This is Nick Naylor
telling you kids,

1087
00:51:48,697 --> 00:51:51,761
"Don't do drugs, smoke cigarettes."

1088
00:51:51,863 --> 00:51:52,977
That's really great.

1089
00:51:53,081 --> 00:51:54,640
It's like I'm looking in a mirror.

1090
00:51:54,743 --> 00:51:56,783
New idea:

1091
00:51:56,888 --> 00:51:59,156
cigarettes for the homeless.

1092
00:51:59,255 --> 00:52:00,302
We'll call them "hobos."

1093
00:52:01,783 --> 00:52:03,092
Uh, that's awful.

1094
00:52:03,191 --> 00:52:04,652
Any better than "Sector Sixes"?

1095
00:52:04,758 --> 00:52:06,646
Right.

1096
00:52:06,743 --> 00:52:09,458
Oh, my God, Nick, you're on TV.

1097
00:52:10,582 --> 00:52:13,103
"Lobbyist on the lookout."

1098
00:52:13,206 --> 00:52:16,271
You got to be kidding me.

1099
00:52:17,493 --> 00:52:21,038
I want to fuck you
while I watch you on TV.

1100
00:52:21,141 --> 00:52:22,799
And they call me sick.

1101
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:23,761
Hurry.

1102
00:52:23,859 --> 00:52:25,769
Before your segment ends.

1103
00:52:25,875 --> 00:52:27,730
All right.

1104
00:52:33,266 --> 00:52:35,306
Tell me more about Los Angeles, baby.

1105
00:52:35,410 --> 00:52:36,522
Huh?

1106
00:52:40,561 --> 00:52:42,285
<i>He says he wants
to trail me everywhere,</i>

1107
00:52:42,385 --> 00:52:43,496
I said, "Who's paying for it?"

1108
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,030
He says the tobacco company's
paying for it.

1109
00:52:45,138 --> 00:52:46,599
I said, "I don't need a bodyguard."

1110
00:52:46,706 --> 00:52:48,198
I'm a man of the people.

1111
00:52:48,304 --> 00:52:50,093
Rock on, Kennedy.

1112
00:52:50,192 --> 00:52:51,818
Listen, we're all going to
need bodyguards soon enough.

1113
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,642
Did you see the coverage
the fetal alcohol people

1114
00:52:53,742 --> 00:52:54,758
got themselves over this weekend?

1115
00:52:54,864 --> 00:52:56,619
They made it seem like
we were encouraging

1116
00:52:56,719 --> 00:52:57,798
pregnant women to drink.

1117
00:52:57,903 --> 00:52:58,950
I'm surprised I didn't get kidnapped

1118
00:52:59,055 --> 00:53:00,331
on my way to work this morning.

1119
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:03,778
I don't think people from
the alcoholic beverage industry

1120
00:53:03,886 --> 00:53:05,795
need to worry about
being kidnapped just yet.

1121
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:08,868
Pardon me?

1122
00:53:08,974 --> 00:53:10,217
Look, I mean,

1123
00:53:10,317 --> 00:53:12,225
nothing personal,
but tobacco generates

1124
00:53:12,332 --> 00:53:14,471
a little more heat than alcohol.

1125
00:53:14,572 --> 00:53:15,979
Oh, this is news.

1126
00:53:16,076 --> 00:53:19,556
My product puts away 475,000 a year.

1127
00:53:19,659 --> 00:53:22,212
Oh, okay, now 475 is a legit number.

1128
00:53:22,315 --> 00:53:23,493
Okay, 435,000.

1129
00:53:23,595 --> 00:53:24,610
That's 1,200 a day.

1130
00:53:24,715 --> 00:53:25,992
How many alcohol-related deaths
a year?

1131
00:53:26,092 --> 00:53:28,130
- Well, does that...
- 100,000 tops?

1132
00:53:28,235 --> 00:53:31,714
That's, what, 270 a day?

1133
00:53:31,818 --> 00:53:32,931
Wowee.

1134
00:53:33,034 --> 00:53:35,303
270 people, a tragedy.

1135
00:53:35,402 --> 00:53:37,311
Excuse me if I don't exactly see
terrorists getting excited

1136
00:53:37,416 --> 00:53:38,978
about kidnapping anyone
from the alcohol industry.

1137
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:40,291
- Well, you haven't even
- Okay,

1138
00:53:40,393 --> 00:53:42,149
- taken into account the number of deaths
- let's just

1139
00:53:42,248 --> 00:53:44,834
- breathe.
- How many gun deaths a year in the U. S?

1140
00:53:44,937 --> 00:53:46,595
11,000.

1141
00:53:46,695 --> 00:53:48,933
11,000, are you kidding me?

1142
00:53:49,033 --> 00:53:50,886
30 a day.

1143
00:53:50,984 --> 00:53:52,357
That's less than passenger car
mortalities.

1144
00:53:52,456 --> 00:53:53,981
No terrorist would bother
with either of you.

1145
00:54:07,109 --> 00:54:08,800
Okay, look...
stupid argument.

1146
00:54:08,902 --> 00:54:10,843
I'll say.

1147
00:54:10,949 --> 00:54:13,796
I'm sure both of you warrant
vigilante justice.

1148
00:54:13,892 --> 00:54:15,582
Thank you.

1149
00:54:35,584 --> 00:54:36,795
Hey... please.
Stop... hey.

1150
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:37,945
Who are you guys?

1151
00:54:41,696 --> 00:54:43,901
<i>And freedom means
that we can do what we want.</i>

1152
00:54:44,001 --> 00:54:46,269
And that's really important.

1153
00:54:46,368 --> 00:54:49,815
Because otherwise,
we couldn't be free.

1154
00:54:49,919 --> 00:54:53,782
And that's why America is
the best government in the world.

1155
00:54:53,887 --> 00:54:55,380
Whoa, hey, hey, hey.

1156
00:54:55,486 --> 00:54:58,073
Hey, no need for that,
no need for that.

1157
00:54:58,175 --> 00:54:59,482
Whoa, whoa, hey.

1158
00:54:59,581 --> 00:55:00,509
Hey, wait.

1159
00:55:00,606 --> 00:55:01,750
Can we get a dialogue going here?

1160
00:55:01,854 --> 00:55:04,505
Nick, we want you
to stop killing people.

1161
00:55:04,605 --> 00:55:06,263
So many people.

1162
00:55:06,365 --> 00:55:07,859
Half a million people a year
in the U.S.

1163
00:55:07,965 --> 00:55:09,590
That, there's no data
to support that.

1164
00:55:09,692 --> 00:55:11,732
Nick... you're not on TV anymore.

1165
00:55:15,004 --> 00:55:16,630
Okay, Joey, it's your turn.

1166
00:55:19,132 --> 00:55:20,342
Hey!

1167
00:55:20,444 --> 00:55:21,785
Nick, how much do you smoke a day?

1168
00:55:21,883 --> 00:55:23,376
Hey, what are you doing?

1169
00:55:23,482 --> 00:55:25,653
According to the box,
each one of those patches

1170
00:55:25,754 --> 00:55:27,827
contains 21 milligrams of nicotine.

1171
00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:28,857
That's, like, what?

1172
00:55:28,954 --> 00:55:30,296
One pack?

1173
00:55:30,394 --> 00:55:32,599
Our industry has been working
hand in hand with...

1174
00:55:32,699 --> 00:55:34,552
Nick! Just listen, all right?

1175
00:55:34,649 --> 00:55:36,143
What makes America
the best government?

1176
00:55:36,249 --> 00:55:38,453
The passion that doesn't exist
anywhere in the world.

1177
00:55:38,553 --> 00:55:40,375
Says here there are
many adverse reactions

1178
00:55:40,473 --> 00:55:41,487
from those things.

1179
00:55:41,592 --> 00:55:43,414
Let's see, "arrhythmia,

1180
00:55:43,511 --> 00:55:44,919
"constipation, dyspepsia,

1181
00:55:45,016 --> 00:55:47,437
- "nausea...
- My industry does $48 billion in revenue.

1182
00:55:47,543 --> 00:55:49,168
pharyngitis, sinusitis..."

1183
00:55:49,271 --> 00:55:51,988
Sure you can call it capitalism,
a free market,

1184
00:55:52,087 --> 00:55:53,647
a celebration of tariff breakdowns...

1185
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:56,303
"dysmenorrhea..."

1186
00:55:56,407 --> 00:55:58,293
I don't even want to know
what that means.

1187
00:55:58,390 --> 00:56:00,080
Hey, look, I guess you could
start by, you know,

1188
00:56:00,182 --> 00:56:01,906
asking for five million,
working your way up from there.

1189
00:56:02,006 --> 00:56:03,379
But I don't want any money, Nick.

1190
00:56:03,477 --> 00:56:04,372
Well, what do you want?

1191
00:56:04,469 --> 00:56:05,713
I mean, I'm all ears here.

1192
00:56:05,813 --> 00:56:08,812
I have another word for it-

1193
00:56:08,917 --> 00:56:10,094
love.

1194
00:56:10,197 --> 00:56:11,757
What does any man want?

1195
00:56:11,861 --> 00:56:13,354
The love of a woman,

1196
00:56:13,459 --> 00:56:14,605
crisp bacon...

1197
00:56:14,707 --> 00:56:19,376
an average life span over 80 years.

1198
00:56:19,475 --> 00:56:21,743
Oh, Nick...

1199
00:56:23,827 --> 00:56:25,802
...you don't look so good.

1200
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:34,220
<i>If you should smell smoke,</i>

1201
00:56:34,321 --> 00:56:36,687
<i>please dial zero for the operator.</i>

1202
00:56:36,784 --> 00:56:40,745
<i>Before leaving the room,
check the door for heat.</i>

1203
00:56:40,849 --> 00:56:43,400
<i>Find your nearest
emergency exit,</i>

1204
00:56:43,503 --> 00:56:47,397
<i>then soak a washcloth
and cover your nose and mouth.</i>

1205
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:50,824
<i>Do not remove your washcloth.</i>

1206
00:56:50,926 --> 00:56:54,538
<i>Try at all times to avoid
breathing in the smoke.</i>

1207
00:56:54,638 --> 00:56:57,769
<i>If necessary, crawl on
your hands and knees</i>

1208
00:56:57,870 --> 00:57:00,074
<i>to avoid the inhalation of smoke.</i>

1209
00:57:00,174 --> 00:57:01,798
<i>Do not be alarmed.</i>

1210
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:04,105
<i>There are still
no conclusive studies</i>

1211
00:57:04,206 --> 00:57:06,823
<i>that link smoking to emphysema.</i>

1212
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,042
You woke up.

1213
00:57:15,147 --> 00:57:17,219
<i>Perhaps a bad choice of inflection.</i>

1214
00:57:17,323 --> 00:57:20,835
<i>Is she implying that I
couldve just as easily not?</i>

1215
00:57:31,593 --> 00:57:32,739
I was so scared.

1216
00:57:32,842 --> 00:57:34,051
Hey, Joey.

1217
00:57:35,592 --> 00:57:36,803
What happened?

1218
00:57:36,904 --> 00:57:39,522
No nonsmoker
could've ever withstood

1219
00:57:39,624 --> 00:57:41,533
the amount of nicotine
you had in your bloodstream.

1220
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:43,527
Hate to say it, but...

1221
00:57:43,624 --> 00:57:46,078
cigarettes saved your life.

1222
00:57:48,264 --> 00:57:49,724
Can I quote you on that, doc?

1223
00:57:49,831 --> 00:57:52,002
You're a real trooper, my boy.

1224
00:57:52,103 --> 00:57:53,859
Hey, Captain,

1225
00:57:53,958 --> 00:57:55,234
where are you?

1226
00:57:55,334 --> 00:57:56,993
Winston-Salem General.

1227
00:57:58,438 --> 00:58:00,771
Damn heart failing me again.

1228
00:58:00,869 --> 00:58:02,528
I thought we could be roommates.

1229
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:03,806
Nick, before
we get sidetracked,

1230
00:58:03,909 --> 00:58:05,534
there is one thing.

1231
00:58:05,636 --> 00:58:08,026
All right, don't get
all dramatic on me, doc.

1232
00:58:08,132 --> 00:58:10,073
You can't smoke.

1233
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:14,714
That's no problem.

1234
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:16,281
I've quit before.

1235
00:58:16,387 --> 00:58:18,210
I did during the pregnancy.

1236
00:58:18,307 --> 00:58:19,320
How long, you think?

1237
00:58:19,426 --> 00:58:21,401
I don't think you understand.

1238
00:58:21,507 --> 00:58:23,961
It's a miracle you came
out of this alive.

1239
00:58:24,066 --> 00:58:25,592
Any smoking- one cigarette-

1240
00:58:25,698 --> 00:58:27,705
could put you right back
into a paralytic state.

1241
00:58:27,810 --> 00:58:30,297
Your body just can't handle it.

1242
00:58:35,392 --> 00:58:37,301
Nick, I don't want to put
any more pressure on you,

1243
00:58:37,408 --> 00:58:39,164
but we got a camera crew
waiting out there.

1244
00:58:39,263 --> 00:58:41,205
If we want to make
the evening news...

1245
00:58:41,311 --> 00:58:43,765
You want to unhook me here?

1246
00:58:43,871 --> 00:58:47,613
This just goes to prove what
I've been saying for so long.

1247
00:58:47,711 --> 00:58:51,671
These nicotine patches
are just deadly.

1248
00:58:51,774 --> 00:58:53,463
Smoking saved my life.

1249
00:58:53,565 --> 00:58:56,054
Considering your condition,
will you still be able to appear

1250
00:58:56,158 --> 00:58:58,132
before Senator Finistirre's
subcommittee hearing

1251
00:58:58,236 --> 00:59:00,178
on the usage of poison labels
on cigarette packaging?

1252
00:59:00,285 --> 00:59:01,812
Oh, I think now more than ever

1253
00:59:01,918 --> 00:59:03,672
it is imperative that I be there.

1254
00:59:03,772 --> 00:59:05,714
Nothing will keep me from testifying.

1255
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:08,754
Fucking kidnapping.

1256
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:10,201
I don't understand, sir.

1257
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:13,430
Aren't we considering
the kidnapping a good thing?

1258
00:59:13,531 --> 00:59:15,124
Well, he didn't die.

1259
00:59:15,227 --> 00:59:17,462
He was almost killed, sir.

1260
00:59:17,562 --> 00:59:18,675
That's the point.

1261
00:59:18,779 --> 00:59:20,786
Now he looks like a victim,
lucky bastard.

1262
00:59:22,618 --> 00:59:24,658
The way I heard it,
D.C. police found you naked

1263
00:59:24,762 --> 00:59:26,355
laying in Lincoln's crotch

1264
00:59:26,458 --> 00:59:30,003
<i>covered in nicotine patches
with a sign across your chest</i>

1265
00:59:30,105 --> 00:59:32,494
- that said...
- He doesn't need to hear the details.

1266
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:34,837
It was some pretty fucked up shit.

1267
00:59:34,937 --> 00:59:35,864
Shh!

1268
00:59:35,961 --> 00:59:36,909
How are you feeling?

1269
00:59:37,016 --> 00:59:40,212
I don't know.

1270
00:59:40,312 --> 00:59:42,733
First time I'm thinking these
cigarettes are pretty dangerous.

1271
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,727
You might be right about that.

1272
00:59:44,823 --> 00:59:46,197
What are you doing?

1273
00:59:47,894 --> 00:59:49,750
It may be small,
but it'll do the trick.

1274
00:59:49,846 --> 00:59:50,927
One shot, bam.

1275
00:59:51,031 --> 00:59:53,200
Listen, Nick is not
going to shoot anyone.

1276
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:54,381
Cool.

1277
00:59:54,486 --> 00:59:55,379
Yeah, huh?

1278
00:59:55,477 --> 00:59:56,654
I mean, uh...

1279
00:59:56,757 --> 00:59:58,513
guns are to be treated with
respect, you understand that?

1280
00:59:58,613 --> 01:00:00,501
You'll make a great father.

1281
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:01,905
Thanks.

1282
01:00:05,717 --> 01:00:07,144
Hey, there he is!

1283
01:00:07,251 --> 01:00:08,877
Hey, he's back!

1284
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:10,354
Hey!

1285
01:00:10,452 --> 01:00:11,825
Welcome back.

1286
01:00:11,923 --> 01:00:13,930
- You okay?
- Great.

1287
01:00:14,035 --> 01:00:15,692
Good, 'cause you're booked on
all the Sunday talk shows.

1288
01:00:15,794 --> 01:00:18,478
For once we got public sympathy
on our side.

1289
01:00:18,578 --> 01:00:21,130
We can start our own little
celebrity victim tour.

1290
01:00:21,234 --> 01:00:23,503
I mean, we couldn't have planned
this thing better ourselves.

1291
01:00:23,602 --> 01:00:25,356
Oh, maybe next time
I can lose a lung.

1292
01:00:26,929 --> 01:00:29,295
Oh. Uh, I heard the, uh...

1293
01:00:29,392 --> 01:00:31,497
Heather Holloway article
is coming out tomorrow.

1294
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,455
Really?

1295
01:00:33,553 --> 01:00:34,632
Yeah, anything I should be
worried about?

1296
01:00:34,736 --> 01:00:37,101
Uh, yeah, the Cancer Association.

1297
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:38,509
Apparently, they have it in for us.

1298
01:00:38,608 --> 01:00:40,746
Fuckers.

1299
01:00:50,734 --> 01:00:51,661
What?

1300
01:00:51,757 --> 01:00:54,310
I got a call from the paper.

1301
01:00:54,414 --> 01:00:56,486
Really?
What'd they want?

1302
01:00:56,589 --> 01:00:59,522
They wanted the correct spelling
of my name and job title.

1303
01:00:59,628 --> 01:01:01,384
You didn't tell her
about us, did you?

1304
01:01:01,484 --> 01:01:03,077
Who?

1305
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:04,324
Heather?

1306
01:01:04,428 --> 01:01:06,217
No.

1307
01:01:07,916 --> 01:01:10,021
I mean, maybe in passing, I...

1308
01:01:10,122 --> 01:01:11,683
In passing.

1309
01:01:11,787 --> 01:01:12,966
Oh, God, he fucked her.

1310
01:01:13,066 --> 01:01:14,376
I tried to warn you.

1311
01:01:14,475 --> 01:01:16,809
Hey, he didn't fuck her.
You didn't fuck her, did you?

1312
01:01:19,145 --> 01:01:20,552
When?

1313
01:01:20,649 --> 01:01:21,543
In passing.

1314
01:01:21,642 --> 01:01:22,722
Look, she's a really nice girl.

1315
01:01:22,825 --> 01:01:23,806
Oh, God.

1316
01:01:23,913 --> 01:01:25,822
We're really fucked.

1317
01:01:43,430 --> 01:01:46,082

1338
01:02:50,462 --> 01:02:52,468
I have Heather Holloway on line one.

1339
01:02:52,573 --> 01:02:53,653
Heather.

1340
01:02:53,757 --> 01:02:55,480
Hey, Nick, what did you think?

1341
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:57,173
Heather, uh... I...

1342
01:02:57,275 --> 01:02:59,665
I mean, there's a lot
of information in here, Heather,

1343
01:02:59,771 --> 01:03:01,199
that is off the record.

1344
01:03:01,307 --> 01:03:03,479
You never said anything
about off the record.

1345
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:07,834
I presumed anything said while
I was inside you was privileged.

1346
01:03:07,931 --> 01:03:09,338
Nick...

1347
01:03:09,434 --> 01:03:11,473
If you wanted to talk on a plane

1348
01:03:11,578 --> 01:03:14,808
or at a movie or over dinner,
that would have been fine.

1349
01:03:14,907 --> 01:03:16,848
But you wanted to fuck.

1350
01:03:16,953 --> 01:03:18,327
That's fine by me.

1351
01:03:18,426 --> 01:03:20,368
You used me.

1352
01:03:20,474 --> 01:03:22,034
Oh, Nick, come on.

1353
01:03:22,137 --> 01:03:24,079
Now we're being children.

1354
01:03:24,185 --> 01:03:26,159
Look, we both love our jobs.

1355
01:03:26,264 --> 01:03:28,720
I'm just a reporter,
and you're just a lobbyist.

1356
01:03:28,825 --> 01:03:30,961
How can you do this to me?

1357
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:35,086
For the mortgage.

1358
01:03:43,158 --> 01:03:44,086
Bitch.

1359
01:03:44,182 --> 01:03:45,195
Whore.

1360
01:03:45,301 --> 01:03:48,400
You should have been
more careful, Nick.

1361
01:03:48,502 --> 01:03:51,184
You've destroyed all the good
will created by your kidnapping.

1362
01:03:51,284 --> 01:03:52,529
Well, we'll work up a rebuttal.

1363
01:03:52,629 --> 01:03:55,245
Heather Holloway isn't
the only reporter in town.

1364
01:03:55,347 --> 01:03:56,461
No, there isn't going
to be any rebuttal.

1365
01:03:56,564 --> 01:03:57,579
What do you mean?

1366
01:03:57,684 --> 01:03:58,960
Don't talk to anyone.

1367
01:03:59,059 --> 01:04:00,751
We're pulling you
from the congressional hearing.

1368
01:04:00,852 --> 01:04:02,346
No, no, no. You can't pull me
from the congressional hearing.

1369
01:04:02,452 --> 01:04:03,728
All you'll be doing is giving
credence to her article.

1370
01:04:03,827 --> 01:04:05,003
I'm ready to testify.

1371
01:04:05,106 --> 01:04:06,700
Look, Nick, half of my job
is damage control.

1372
01:04:06,804 --> 01:04:07,850
Today, that consists

1373
01:04:07,955 --> 01:04:10,475
of distancing ourselves
from you entirely-

1374
01:04:10,579 --> 01:04:14,156
letting you take
all the heat on this article.

1375
01:04:14,257 --> 01:04:15,916
Your job relied on your ability
to keep secrets

1376
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:17,065
and spin the truth.

1377
01:04:17,168 --> 01:04:18,795
I just cannot imagine a way

1378
01:04:18,897 --> 01:04:20,458
in which you could have fucked
up more.

1379
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:23,277
There's just no way I could
possibly keep you on staff.

1380
01:04:23,377 --> 01:04:25,099
Then I assume you've run this
by the captain.

1381
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:27,054
Captain died this morning.

1382
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,455
<i>Mr. Naylor,
this is Pete in Security from the Academy.</i>

1383
01:05:24,553 --> 01:05:26,341
<i>Your things are waiting for you</i>

1384
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:28,032
<i>at the information kiosk

1385
01:05:28,136 --> 01:05:29,280
<i>Look, if you don't pick your
stuff up by Friday,</i>

1386
01:05:29,383 --> 01:05:31,620
<i>we're instructed to throw it out.</i>

1387
01:05:33,318 --> 01:05:36,068
<i>Mr. Naylor, this is Special
Agent Johnson with the FBI.</i>

1388
01:05:36,167 --> 01:05:38,720
<i>Having not found any leads in
your kidnapping investigation,</i>

1389
01:05:38,823 --> 01:05:40,066
<i>we're going to be
handing over the case</i>

1390
01:05:40,167 --> 01:05:41,181
<i>to the local D.C. police,</i>

1391
01:05:41,286 --> 01:05:43,390
<i>so please refer to them
in the future</i>

1392
01:05:43,493 --> 01:05:45,020
<i>for any updates and questions.</i>

1393
01:05:46,884 --> 01:05:49,373
<i>Nick, Jack in Jeff Megall's office.</i>

1394
01:05:49,477 --> 01:05:52,771
<i>Jeff really enjoyed
meeting you the other day</i>

1395
01:05:52,868 --> 01:05:54,842
<i>and he's just... he's torn up
about the fact</i>

1396
01:05:54,947 --> 01:05:56,638
<i>that you two couldn't find
a project to work on.</i>

1397
01:05:56,739 --> 01:05:58,780
<i>He's really just... I don't know.</i>

1398
01:05:58,882 --> 01:06:00,575
<i>So, listen,
but we should hang, at least,</i>

1399
01:06:00,677 --> 01:06:02,563
<i>so you drop me a line
whenever you're in town.</i>

1400
01:06:02,659 --> 01:06:05,975
<i>Uh... my e-mail is, uh...</i>

1401
01:06:20,928 --> 01:06:22,489
Who is it?

1402
01:06:22,593 --> 01:06:24,415
It's me, Nick.

1403
01:06:26,271 --> 01:06:28,693
Jill, this is a bad time.

1404
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:30,327
Let me in.

1405
01:06:31,614 --> 01:06:33,305
No.

1406
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:36,254
I brought someone
who needs to talk to you.

1407
01:06:41,244 --> 01:06:42,489
Hey, buddy.

1408
01:06:42,590 --> 01:06:44,445
Hey, Dad.

1409
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:46,483
Coke in the fridge.

1410
01:06:52,668 --> 01:06:57,238
So, this Heather Holloway,
she must have been pretty hot.

1411
01:06:57,339 --> 01:07:00,121
Yes. She's pretty hot.

1412
01:07:00,218 --> 01:07:02,161
Don't take it so hard.

1413
01:07:02,266 --> 01:07:04,786
A few flaws can be appealing.

1414
01:07:04,889 --> 01:07:05,937
Makes you human.

1415
01:07:06,042 --> 01:07:07,417
Who wants to be human?

1416
01:07:07,514 --> 01:07:08,823
Well, I know one person

1417
01:07:08,921 --> 01:07:11,769
who still thinks you're a God.

1418
01:07:27,607 --> 01:07:30,193
Why did you tell that reporter
all your secrets?

1419
01:07:33,302 --> 01:07:35,822
You're too young to understand.

1420
01:07:35,926 --> 01:07:38,892
Mom says it's because
you have dependency issues

1421
01:07:38,997 --> 01:07:40,426
and it was all just
a matter of time

1422
01:07:40,534 --> 01:07:42,606
before you threw it all away
on some tramp.

1423
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:45,873
Well, that's one theory.

1424
01:07:45,972 --> 01:07:47,729
Why are you hiding from everyone?

1425
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:53,196
It has something to do with
being generally hated right now.

1426
01:07:53,299 --> 01:07:54,728
But it's your job to be
generally hated.

1427
01:07:54,835 --> 01:07:57,486
It's more complicated
than that, Joey.

1428
01:07:57,587 --> 01:07:59,757
You're just making it
more complicated

1429
01:07:59,858 --> 01:08:01,352
so that you can feel
sorry for yourself.

1430
01:08:01,459 --> 01:08:03,117
Like you always said,

1431
01:08:03,218 --> 01:08:06,382
"If you want an easy job,
go work for the Red Cross."

1432
01:08:06,482 --> 01:08:08,041
You're a lobbyist.

1433
01:08:08,145 --> 01:08:11,112
Your job is to be right, and
you're the best at what you do.

1434
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:14,030
You're the sultan of spin.

1435
01:08:15,184 --> 01:08:16,527
"Sultan of spin"?

1436
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:18,085
<i>Mom subscribes to Newsweek.</i>

1437
01:08:19,472 --> 01:08:20,749
Who cares what the Brads

1438
01:08:20,848 --> 01:08:21,830
of the world think?

1439
01:08:21,936 --> 01:08:23,145
He's not my dad.

1440
01:08:24,783 --> 01:08:26,191
You are.

1441
01:08:26,288 --> 01:08:29,384
<i>And right there,
looking into Joeys eyes,</i>

1442
01:08:29,486 --> 01:08:32,748
<i>it all came back in a rush.</i>

1443
01:08:32,845 --> 01:08:35,212
<i>Why I do what I do-
defending the defenseless,</i>

1444
01:08:35,310 --> 01:08:37,514
<i>protecting the disenfranchised
corporations</i>

1445
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:39,587
<i>that have been abandoned
by their very own consumers-</i>

1446
01:08:39,693 --> 01:08:41,865
<i>the logger...</i>

1447
01:08:41,965 --> 01:08:44,103
<i>the sweatshop foreman...</i>

1448
01:08:44,205 --> 01:08:46,147
<i>the oil driller...</i>

1449
01:08:46,253 --> 01:08:48,324
<i>the land mine developer...</i>

1450
01:08:48,428 --> 01:08:51,592
<i>the baby seal poacher...</i>

1451
01:08:51,691 --> 01:08:53,032
Baby seal poacher?

1452
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:54,441
Even I think that's kind of cruel.

1453
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:56,547
All right, you're missing the point.

1454
01:08:56,651 --> 01:08:58,342
I must be, because I thought
you were apologizing.

1455
01:08:58,443 --> 01:08:59,370
I'm getting to that.

1456
01:08:59,465 --> 01:09:01,157
When?

1457
01:09:01,259 --> 01:09:03,625
Look.

1458
01:09:03,722 --> 01:09:08,358
The two of you, you're
basically my only friends,

1459
01:09:08,458 --> 01:09:10,662
and the last thing that
I would ever want to do

1460
01:09:10,761 --> 01:09:12,386
would be to hurt you.

1461
01:09:12,489 --> 01:09:14,278
And, I can only imagine...

1462
01:09:14,377 --> 01:09:15,358
Why are you smiling?

1463
01:09:15,465 --> 01:09:17,056
Why is he smiling?

1464
01:09:17,159 --> 01:09:19,167
He won a hundred bucks off of you.

1465
01:09:19,271 --> 01:09:22,173
I bet Polly you'd spill the beans
to that reporter.

1466
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:24,647
That goes against everything
that we stand for.

1467
01:09:24,743 --> 01:09:26,913
Oh, please! You've ratted us out
to some reporter with tits!

1468
01:09:27,014 --> 01:09:28,836
Glorious tits.

1469
01:09:28,934 --> 01:09:31,137
Only after you created a betting
pool testing my incompetence?

1470
01:09:31,238 --> 01:09:33,212
Do you have any idea the beating
I'm taking at Moderation?

1471
01:09:33,317 --> 01:09:35,935
Well, look, I'm sure both of
you are under a lot of scrutiny.

1472
01:09:36,037 --> 01:09:38,143
You know what?
You can stop using the plural.

1473
01:09:38,246 --> 01:09:41,310
The guys at Safety actually liked
the name "Merchants of Death."

1474
01:09:41,412 --> 01:09:42,657
They're gonna have
some bumper stickers made up.

1475
01:09:42,757 --> 01:09:44,580
I'll make sure you get one.

1476
01:09:44,678 --> 01:09:46,531
Thank you.

1477
01:09:48,612 --> 01:09:50,368
That is disgusting.

1478
01:09:51,683 --> 01:09:53,341
It's American.

1479
01:09:53,443 --> 01:09:54,937
Can I have a bite?

1480
01:09:55,042 --> 01:09:56,504
Mmm.

1481
01:09:56,610 --> 01:09:58,585
So I guess this means

1482
01:09:58,691 --> 01:10:01,788
you won't be appearing
at Finistirre's subcommittee.

1483
01:10:01,890 --> 01:10:04,029
Hmm. I was kind of looking
forward to it, too.

1484
01:10:04,131 --> 01:10:06,780
It's kind of cool in
a Jimmy Stewart sort of way.

1485
01:10:06,881 --> 01:10:09,303
More like an Ollie North sort of way.

1486
01:10:09,409 --> 01:10:11,547
Finistirre would have
torn you a new asshole

1487
01:10:11,648 --> 01:10:13,110
in a House of Parliament, no less.

1488
01:10:13,217 --> 01:10:14,461
I could have taken him.

1489
01:10:14,561 --> 01:10:16,153
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah? What would you have said?

1490
01:10:16,256 --> 01:10:17,433
I don't know.

1491
01:10:17,535 --> 01:10:20,634
I'd just like him to feel
immeasurable pain,

1492
01:10:20,734 --> 01:10:22,143
humiliation.

1493
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:23,646
Yeah, well, that would be
kind of tough.

1494
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:25,051
I mean, he's already a Senator.

1495
01:10:26,911 --> 01:10:29,015
I mean, how would you get
back in even if you wanted to?

1496
01:10:32,894 --> 01:10:34,006
Uh-oh.

1497
01:10:39,708 --> 01:10:40,952
You're not gonna like this.

1498
01:10:43,932 --> 01:10:45,012
Hello.
Thanks very much for coming.

1499
01:10:45,115 --> 01:10:47,352
First of all, I'd like to say
a few words

1500
01:10:47,452 --> 01:10:48,532
to all the people who
are mentioned

1501
01:10:48,637 --> 01:10:50,610
in the recent newspaper article.

1502
01:10:50,714 --> 01:10:52,144
Please take comfort in knowing

1503
01:10:52,252 --> 01:10:55,862
that I will not rest until
your names are cleared.

1504
01:10:55,963 --> 01:10:57,970
This experience has taught me
an important lesson-

1505
01:10:58,075 --> 01:10:59,797
having sexual affairs
with members of the press

1506
01:10:59,898 --> 01:11:01,327
is just unfair.

1507
01:11:01,434 --> 01:11:03,189
It's not unfair to me, mind you,

1508
01:11:03,289 --> 01:11:06,605
but to all the people in my life
whose only crime is knowing me.

1509
01:11:06,713 --> 01:11:09,779
It was your names, not mine,
that suffered

1510
01:11:09,881 --> 01:11:12,303
from a meaningless affair
with a seductress

1511
01:11:12,409 --> 01:11:15,725
in the form of a young
brunette Washington reporter

1512
01:11:15,831 --> 01:11:17,325
whose name I won't mention

1513
01:11:17,432 --> 01:11:19,286
because I have dignity.

1514
01:11:21,111 --> 01:11:22,093
Mr. Naylor!

1515
01:11:22,199 --> 01:11:23,922
Are you still planning
on testifying

1516
01:11:24,022 --> 01:11:26,029
at tomorrow's subcommittee
hearing on tobacco?

1517
01:11:26,134 --> 01:11:28,305
I'm glad you asked that question.

1518
01:11:28,405 --> 01:11:30,096
There have been wide accusations of me
dropping out of tomorrow's hearing.

1519
01:11:30,198 --> 01:11:31,375
Let it be known

1520
01:11:31,478 --> 01:11:33,135
that unless Senator Finistirre
has withdrawn my invitation

1521
01:11:33,237 --> 01:11:34,612
- to speak, it is my plan
- It's called a subpoena.

1522
01:11:34,709 --> 01:11:36,466
to be in Congress tomorrow
to share my knowledge

1523
01:11:36,566 --> 01:11:38,735
of big tobacco and all those
who enjoy its products.

1524
01:11:38,836 --> 01:11:40,047
Thank you very much.
I'll see you tomorrow.

1525
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:39,748
Still feel like Jimmy Stewart?

1526
01:12:50,315 --> 01:12:51,262
Good.

1527
01:12:59,017 --> 01:13:00,065
Why don't you all go ahead?

1528
01:13:00,170 --> 01:13:01,631
This could be a while.

1529
01:13:06,312 --> 01:13:11,133
If we could, um... if we could
take our seats, please.

1530
01:13:13,768 --> 01:13:16,223
Gentlemen, ladies.

1531
01:13:16,327 --> 01:13:18,944
If I may call this meeting to order.

1532
01:13:19,046 --> 01:13:23,618
We'll do everything we can to
keep things brief and concise

1533
01:13:23,719 --> 01:13:25,179
so that we can all
get out of here on time.

1534
01:13:25,285 --> 01:13:28,635
The skull and crossbones
means one thing:

1535
01:13:28,741 --> 01:13:30,147
Poison.

1536
01:13:30,245 --> 01:13:32,831
Thus, the message is quite clear.

1537
01:13:32,933 --> 01:13:35,004
Like any other product
that carries the branding,

1538
01:13:35,107 --> 01:13:38,207
if you take it, you will die.

1539
01:13:38,309 --> 01:13:41,242
Yes, but isn't this overkill?

1540
01:13:41,347 --> 01:13:44,479
Why don't we just use words,
as we currently do?

1541
01:13:44,580 --> 01:13:48,224
Something that describes the
dangers of cigarette smoking.

1542
01:13:48,324 --> 01:13:49,304
Well, the American public
is not affected

1543
01:13:49,410 --> 01:13:50,817
by masthead anymore.

1544
01:13:50,914 --> 01:13:52,026
They need images.

1545
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:54,399
We've done studies
which show that consumers react

1546
01:13:54,498 --> 01:13:56,953
up to 80% more to imagery
rather than words.

1547
01:13:57,057 --> 01:13:58,302
The stats are there.

1548
01:13:58,401 --> 01:14:00,124
It's just sad

1549
01:14:00,225 --> 01:14:02,462
that the Academy of Tobacco
Studies did not release

1550
01:14:02,562 --> 01:14:03,902
this type of information earlier.

1551
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,847
When you say
the Academy of Tobacco Studies,

1552
01:14:06,944 --> 01:14:08,221
you're referring to...

1553
01:14:08,321 --> 01:14:09,400
Yes.

1554
01:14:09,503 --> 01:14:11,161
to the coalition...

1555
01:14:11,264 --> 01:14:12,158
Yes, the coalition.

1556
01:14:12,256 --> 01:14:13,782
The big... big tobacco...

1557
01:14:13,888 --> 01:14:15,097
...that is represented by...

1558
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:16,377
By, um...

1559
01:14:16,479 --> 01:14:17,558
And specifically

1560
01:14:17,663 --> 01:14:18,524
Mr...

1561
01:14:18,622 --> 01:14:19,637
Um...

1562
01:14:19,743 --> 01:14:21,269
Mr., uh, Nick Naylor.

1563
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:22,236
Nick Naylor?

1564
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:23,261
Thank you very much.

1565
01:14:25,181 --> 01:14:26,043
<i>The current use</i>

1566
01:14:26,141 --> 01:14:27,702
of words instead of imagery

1567
01:14:27,806 --> 01:14:31,252
is an obvious move against
the non-English-speaking population

1568
01:14:31,357 --> 01:14:32,764
of the United States.

1569
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:34,899
The skull and crossbones

1570
01:14:35,004 --> 01:14:38,233
speak loudly in all languages.

1571
01:14:38,332 --> 01:14:40,819
By not using it,
they're saying

1572
01:14:40,924 --> 01:14:44,785
they want those who can't
read English to die.

1573
01:14:44,891 --> 01:14:46,581
Hmm. Senor Herrera,

1574
01:14:46,683 --> 01:14:49,400
could you clarify "they"?

1575
01:14:49,498 --> 01:14:50,742
<i>Let it be known,</i>

1576
01:14:50,842 --> 01:14:53,208
<i>the public beating
has not gone out of style.</i>

1577
01:15:00,249 --> 01:15:02,321
Nick Naylor, please step forward.

1578
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:14,160
You go sit with him.

1579
01:15:22,198 --> 01:15:25,067
Please state your name,
address and current occupation.

1580
01:15:25,174 --> 01:15:26,254
My name is Nick Naylor.

1581
01:15:26,358 --> 01:15:28,047
I live at 6000
Massachusetts Avenue

1582
01:15:28,149 --> 01:15:29,971
and I am currently unemployed,

1583
01:15:30,069 --> 01:15:32,109
but until recently,
I was the vice president

1584
01:15:32,212 --> 01:15:33,641
of the Academy of Tobacco Studies.

1585
01:15:33,749 --> 01:15:34,609
Mr. Naylor,

1586
01:15:34,708 --> 01:15:38,024
as vice president
of the Academy

1587
01:15:38,132 --> 01:15:40,019
of Tobacco Studies,
what was required of you?

1588
01:15:40,116 --> 01:15:41,292
What did you do?

1589
01:15:41,395 --> 01:15:44,744
I informed the public
of all the research performed

1590
01:15:44,851 --> 01:15:46,759
in the investigation
on the effects of tobacco.

1591
01:15:46,866 --> 01:15:47,946
Mm-hmm,
and what,

1592
01:15:48,050 --> 01:15:50,506
so far,
has the Academy concluded

1593
01:15:50,610 --> 01:15:52,943
in their investigation
into the effects of tobacco?

1594
01:15:53,041 --> 01:15:55,212
Well, many things, actually.

1595
01:15:55,313 --> 01:15:57,003
Why, just the other day
they uncovered evidence

1596
01:15:57,105 --> 01:15:58,861
that smoking can offset
Parkinson's disease.

1597
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:01,898
I'm sure the health
community

1598
01:16:02,001 --> 01:16:03,080
is thrilled.

1599
01:16:03,184 --> 01:16:05,965
Mr. Naylor, who provides
the financial backing

1600
01:16:06,063 --> 01:16:07,951
for the Academy of Tobacco Studies?

1601
01:16:08,048 --> 01:16:11,178
Uh... Conglomerated Tobacco.

1602
01:16:11,278 --> 01:16:12,904
That's the cigarette companies.

1603
01:16:13,007 --> 01:16:14,982
For the most part, yes.

1604
01:16:15,087 --> 01:16:17,869
Do you think that...

1605
01:16:17,967 --> 01:16:19,854
might affect their priorities?

1606
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:21,225
No, just as I'm sure

1607
01:16:21,325 --> 01:16:23,081
campaign contributions
don't affect yours.

1608
01:16:23,181 --> 01:16:24,164
Ohh.

1609
01:16:26,060 --> 01:16:29,159
Senators, Mr. Naylor is not here
to testify on the goings-on

1610
01:16:29,261 --> 01:16:30,983
of the Academy of Tobacco Studies.

1611
01:16:31,084 --> 01:16:33,059
We're here to examine
the possibility

1612
01:16:33,164 --> 01:16:34,506
of a warning logo on cigarettes.

1613
01:16:34,604 --> 01:16:35,531
Now, Mr. Naylor,

1614
01:16:35,627 --> 01:16:37,088
I have to ask you,
out of formality,

1615
01:16:37,195 --> 01:16:39,082
do you believe that smoking
cigarettes, over time,

1616
01:16:39,180 --> 01:16:42,278
can lead to lung cancer and
other respiratory conditions

1617
01:16:42,379 --> 01:16:43,523
such as emphysema?

1618
01:16:45,322 --> 01:16:46,751
Yes.

1619
01:16:49,481 --> 01:16:50,343
In fact, I think you'd be
hard-pressed

1620
01:16:50,442 --> 01:16:51,489
to find someone
who really believes

1621
01:16:51,594 --> 01:16:53,481
that cigarettes are not
potentially harmful.

1622
01:16:53,578 --> 01:16:55,716
I mean, show of hands,
who out here thinks

1623
01:16:55,816 --> 01:16:57,245
- that cigarettes aren't dangerous...
- Mr. Naylor.

1624
01:16:57,353 --> 01:17:00,353
There's no need for theatrics.

1625
01:17:00,456 --> 01:17:02,911
Sir, I just don't see the point in a warning
label for something people already know.

1626
01:17:03,016 --> 01:17:04,260
The warning symbol

1627
01:17:04,359 --> 01:17:07,839
is a reminder, a reminder of the
dangers of smoking cigarettes.

1628
01:17:07,943 --> 01:17:09,698
Well, if we want to remind
people of danger,

1629
01:17:09,799 --> 01:17:11,260
why don't we slap
a skull and crossbones

1630
01:17:11,367 --> 01:17:12,295
on all Boeing airplanes,

1631
01:17:12,391 --> 01:17:13,764
Senator Lothridge?

1632
01:17:13,862 --> 01:17:14,755
And all Fords, Senator Dupree?

1633
01:17:14,854 --> 01:17:17,091
That is ridiculous.

1634
01:17:17,190 --> 01:17:19,393
The death toll from airline
and automobile accidents

1635
01:17:19,493 --> 01:17:21,468
doesn't even skim the surface
of cigarettes.

1636
01:17:21,574 --> 01:17:22,588
They don't even compare.

1637
01:17:22,693 --> 01:17:24,667
Oh, this from a senator
who calls Vermont home.

1638
01:17:24,772 --> 01:17:26,812
I don't follow you, Mr. Naylor.

1639
01:17:26,917 --> 01:17:28,509
Well, the real

1640
01:17:28,612 --> 01:17:31,067
demonstrated number one killer
in America is cholesterol,

1641
01:17:31,172 --> 01:17:32,121
and here comes
Senator Finistirre,

1642
01:17:32,229 --> 01:17:34,367
whose fine state is,
I regret to say,

1643
01:17:34,467 --> 01:17:37,370
clogging the nation's arteries
with Vermont cheddar cheese.

1644
01:17:38,946 --> 01:17:41,565
If we want to talk numbers,
how about the millions of people

1645
01:17:41,667 --> 01:17:42,594
dying of heart attacks.

1646
01:17:42,691 --> 01:17:43,901
Perhaps Vermont cheddar

1647
01:17:44,003 --> 01:17:46,272
should come
with a skull and crossbones.

1648
01:17:46,371 --> 01:17:48,126
That is lud...

1649
01:17:48,225 --> 01:17:49,152
The great state of Vermont

1650
01:17:49,249 --> 01:17:50,743
will not apologize for its cheese.

1651
01:17:50,849 --> 01:17:51,777
Mr. Naylor,

1652
01:17:51,874 --> 01:17:53,302
we are here to discuss cigarettes.

1653
01:17:53,408 --> 01:17:56,889
Not planes, not cars- cigarettes.

1654
01:17:56,992 --> 01:17:59,544
Now, as we discussed earlier,
these warning labels

1655
01:17:59,648 --> 01:18:02,713
are not for those who know, but
rather for those who don't know.

1656
01:18:04,607 --> 01:18:06,517
What about the children?

1657
01:18:06,624 --> 01:18:08,565
Gentlemen...

1658
01:18:08,670 --> 01:18:10,525
it's called education.

1659
01:18:10,622 --> 01:18:12,412
It doesn't come off the side
of a cigarette carton.

1660
01:18:12,509 --> 01:18:13,524
It comes from our teachers,

1661
01:18:13,630 --> 01:18:15,605
and more importantly, our parents.

1662
01:18:15,710 --> 01:18:18,709
It is the job
of every parent

1663
01:18:18,813 --> 01:18:22,293
to warn their children of all
the dangers of the world,

1664
01:18:22,397 --> 01:18:24,852
including cigarettes, so that
one day, when they get older,

1665
01:18:24,957 --> 01:18:26,711
they can choose for themselves.

1666
01:18:28,860 --> 01:18:31,894
I look at my... son

1667
01:18:31,995 --> 01:18:33,338
who...

1668
01:18:33,435 --> 01:18:35,191
was kind enough
to come with me today,

1669
01:18:35,291 --> 01:18:37,680
and I can't help but think

1670
01:18:37,787 --> 01:18:39,958
that I am responsible
for his growth

1671
01:18:40,059 --> 01:18:42,098
and his development.

1672
01:18:42,202 --> 01:18:43,664
And I'm proud of that.

1673
01:18:43,770 --> 01:18:44,981
Well, having
said that,

1674
01:18:45,083 --> 01:18:47,536
would you condone him smoking?

1675
01:18:47,641 --> 01:18:49,878
Well, of course not.
He's not 18.

1676
01:18:49,978 --> 01:18:50,992
That would be illegal.

1677
01:18:52,217 --> 01:18:54,224
<i>Yes, I-I heard you deliver
that line on 20-20,</i>

1678
01:18:54,330 --> 01:18:55,639
but enough dancing.

1679
01:18:55,738 --> 01:18:57,973
What are you going to do
when he turns 18?

1680
01:18:59,577 --> 01:19:01,070
Come on, Mr. Naylor.

1681
01:19:01,175 --> 01:19:04,590
On his 18th birthday, will
you share a cigarette with him?

1682
01:19:04,694 --> 01:19:06,833
Will you spend
a lovely afternoon,

1683
01:19:06,935 --> 01:19:09,007
like one of your ludicrous
cigarette advertisements?

1684
01:19:09,110 --> 01:19:10,571
You seem to have a lot to say

1685
01:19:10,678 --> 01:19:11,954
about how we
should raise our children.

1686
01:19:12,054 --> 01:19:12,981
What of your own?

1687
01:19:13,077 --> 01:19:15,443
What are you
going to do

1688
01:19:15,542 --> 01:19:17,745
when he turns 18?

1689
01:19:24,085 --> 01:19:27,597
If he really wants a cigarette,
I'll buy him his first pack.

1690
01:19:32,148 --> 01:19:34,863
Thank you for your testimony,
Mr. Naylor. You're excused.

1691
01:19:41,426 --> 01:19:42,800
I'll meet you outside, okay?

1692
01:19:54,863 --> 01:19:56,358
Great.

1693
01:19:56,464 --> 01:19:57,545
Well done, my boy.

1694
01:19:57,647 --> 01:19:59,687
Were you in the same room as me?

1695
01:19:59,791 --> 01:20:00,839
The whole personal choice thing?

1696
01:20:00,943 --> 01:20:02,023
They ate that shit up.

1697
01:20:02,128 --> 01:20:03,884
Just checked the whip count.

1698
01:20:03,983 --> 01:20:05,325
That bill is going down in flames.

1699
01:20:05,422 --> 01:20:08,140
Your speech was unorthodox,
but you did it, boy.

1700
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:09,099
You crushed the fucker.

1701
01:20:09,198 --> 01:20:10,279
That's good news for you guys.

1702
01:20:10,381 --> 01:20:11,724
Oh. Whoa, whoa.

1703
01:20:11,822 --> 01:20:14,604
We're still a team, right?

1704
01:20:14,701 --> 01:20:16,589
What about damage control?

1705
01:20:18,030 --> 01:20:19,338
Look, Nick.

1706
01:20:19,437 --> 01:20:22,885
Winston-Salem is ready
to do whatever it takes

1707
01:20:22,988 --> 01:20:24,449
to keep you onboard.

1708
01:20:32,363 --> 01:20:35,297
Nick, will you continue
fighting for cigarettes?

1709
01:20:35,403 --> 01:20:36,679
Of course he will.

1710
01:20:36,779 --> 01:20:38,665
This man here is our general.

1711
01:20:38,761 --> 01:20:40,452
We're not just gonna let him retire.

1712
01:20:40,553 --> 01:20:41,536
Is that correct, Nick?

1713
01:20:41,642 --> 01:20:43,069
You're sticking with tobacco?

1714
01:20:46,953 --> 01:20:50,301
<i>Now, I know what
you're probably thinking.</i>

1715
01:20:50,408 --> 01:20:51,522
<i>What a great opportunity for me</i>

1716
01:20:51,625 --> 01:20:53,150
<i>to teach Joey
how to use leverage against</i>

1717
01:20:53,255 --> 01:20:54,782
<i>a backstabbing boss.</i>

1718
01:20:54,888 --> 01:20:58,182
<i>But I actually meant what
I said about responsibility.</i>

1719
01:20:58,280 --> 01:21:01,760
<i>Some things
are just more important</i>

1720
01:21:01,864 --> 01:21:02,974
<i>than paying a mortgage.</i>

1721
01:21:03,078 --> 01:21:05,566
<i>So I did the only responsible
thing I could.</i>

1722
01:21:05,671 --> 01:21:08,321
<i>I turned down the job.</i>

1723
01:21:08,421 --> 01:21:10,657
<i>And my timing
couldn't have been better.</i>

1724
01:21:10,757 --> 01:21:12,961
<i>Within a few months,
the cigarette companies</i>

1725
01:21:13,061 --> 01:21:14,402
<i>settled
with the American smoker</i>

1726
01:21:14,501 --> 01:21:17,054
<i>to the tune of $246 billion.</i>

1727
01:21:18,181 --> 01:21:20,416
<i>And the Academy
of Tobacco Studies</i>

1728
01:21:20,516 --> 01:21:22,207
<i>was permanently dismantled.</i>

1729
01:21:22,308 --> 01:21:24,511
<i>For the first time in decades,</i>

1730
01:21:24,612 --> 01:21:26,238
<i>BR found himself out of work.</i>

1731
01:21:27,939 --> 01:21:29,947
<i>Otherwise, not much has changed.</i>

1732
01:21:30,052 --> 01:21:32,123
<i>The MOD squad still meets every week.</i>

1733
01:21:32,227 --> 01:21:33,471
Nice.

1734
01:21:33,570 --> 01:21:35,742
<i>We even added a few new members.</i>

1735
01:21:35,843 --> 01:21:38,524
The things I could learn
from you, BobbyJay.

1736
01:21:38,625 --> 01:21:39,574
Right.

1737
01:21:39,682 --> 01:21:41,056
Stick around. Stick around.

1738
01:21:41,154 --> 01:21:43,771
<i>Senator Finistirre is still
fighting for his causes.</i>

1739
01:21:43,874 --> 01:21:45,565
What do you say
to the people who claim

1740
01:21:45,666 --> 01:21:47,519
you are destroying cinema classics?

1741
01:21:47,617 --> 01:21:49,176
Mmm, no. All
we're doing

1742
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:50,873
is using
digital technology

1743
01:21:50,977 --> 01:21:54,009
to tastefully update
movies of the past...

1744
01:21:54,112 --> 01:21:55,606
by removing cigarettes.

1745
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:58,810
<i>I believe that if these
stars were alive today,</i>

1746
01:21:58,911 --> 01:22:01,245
<i>they would agree that
we're doing the right thing.</i>

1747
01:22:01,342 --> 01:22:03,001
But, in essence, aren't
you changing history?

1748
01:22:03,103 --> 01:22:06,876
No, I think we're improving history.

1749
01:22:08,669 --> 01:22:09,947
<i>Even Heather is still reporting.</i>

1750
01:22:10,046 --> 01:22:11,354
The whole town has been evacuated.

1751
01:22:11,454 --> 01:22:16,537
They're calling this
the storm of the century.

1752
01:22:16,636 --> 01:22:17,913
<i>Not much changes at all.</i>

1753
01:22:18,013 --> 01:22:22,518
And this year's Foggy Bottom
Debating Society Champion is...

1754
01:22:22,620 --> 01:22:23,569
Joey Naylor.

1755
01:22:23,677 --> 01:22:24,788
- Yay!
- Yay!

1756
01:22:24,892 --> 01:22:25,753
Joey!

1757
01:22:25,852 --> 01:22:26,712
Joey!

1758
01:22:26,811 --> 01:22:27,673
Joey, Joey!

1759
01:22:27,772 --> 01:22:29,233
That's my boy.

1760
01:22:29,340 --> 01:22:30,833
Hold it up. Hold it up.

1761
01:22:34,331 --> 01:22:36,273
<i>And me?</i>

1762
01:22:36,377 --> 01:22:38,963
<i>Well, there's still a place
for guys like me.</i>

1763
01:22:39,066 --> 01:22:41,586
So, be straight with me.

1764
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:44,307
Is it true?

1765
01:22:44,409 --> 01:22:45,750
- It could be.
- Come on.

1766
01:22:45,849 --> 01:22:47,856
We know of very few cases.

1767
01:22:47,961 --> 01:22:49,040
There's no scientific proof at all.

1768
01:22:49,145 --> 01:22:50,005
There was an unfortunate
incident out in Iowa...

1769
01:22:50,104 --> 01:22:51,031
It's really a complicated situation.

1770
01:22:51,127 --> 01:22:52,273
Gentlemen,

1771
01:22:52,376 --> 01:22:54,862
practice these words
in front of the mirror.

1772
01:22:54,966 --> 01:22:57,814
"Although we are constantly
exploring the subject,

1773
01:22:57,911 --> 01:23:00,496
"currently,
there is no direct evidence

1774
01:23:00,599 --> 01:23:01,941
"that links cell phone usage

1775
01:23:02,039 --> 01:23:03,827
to brain cancer."

1776
01:23:10,069 --> 01:23:11,793
<i>Michael Jordan plays ball.</i>

1777
01:23:11,893 --> 01:23:13,387
<i>Charles Manson kills people.</i>

1778
01:23:13,494 --> 01:23:14,899
<i>I talk.</i>

1779
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:17,581
<i>Everyone has a talent.</i>
