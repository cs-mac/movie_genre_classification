1
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:11,254
This movie is based on land disputes

2
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:15,407
which have been going on
in Texas since 1848.

3
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:01,151
Mom? What was that?

4
00:02:02,422 --> 00:02:05,272
Don't know, hon. I'll go check.

5
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:28,392
Jackie, why didn't you
close the window?

6
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,461
An animal could've gotten in.

7
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,404
Take what you want and leave.

8
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,316
I could kill you very easily.

9
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:54,506
Do you want that?

10
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:56,822
No.

11
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:58,854
Me neither.

12
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:08,961
Would you please
take that painting off the wall?

13
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:26,535
Open it, please.

14
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:40,732
Hello.

15
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,170
<i>You think you're real macho,
hitting a woman?</i>

16
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:50,241
How did you get this number?
It's private. Who is this?

17
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,570
<i>Don't worry about me.</i>

18
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:53,874
<i>Worry about the sheriff
who's on his way.</i>

19
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:55,697
The sheriff?

20
00:03:55,802 --> 00:04:00,442
<i>Yeah, you picked
the wrong house to rob.</i>

21
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,750
Don't tell me
the sheriff is on his way.

22
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:06,484
Sheriff Johnson, right?

23
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,919
The same guy that told me
where your house was.

24
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:11,115
And where your safe was.

25
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:13,348
Hello?

26
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:16,231
Jackie!

27
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:25,437
Jackie, huh?

28
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:27,636
Leave her alone!

29
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:30,909
The safe!

30
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:34,111
The safe... I'm the only one
that can open it.

31
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:35,887
It's encrypted.

32
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:38,545
Encrypted with my own
security software.

33
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:42,961
Then open it.

34
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:46,794
- Now!
- I'm opening it!

35
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:09,008
Wow. Impressive.

36
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,412
- Hello?
- <i>Rex, tell me you got the documents.</i>

37
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:39,608
Yes.

38
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:44,121
So you Want me to make it
look like an accident?

39
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:46,280
<i>Just bring me those papers
and get the hell out of there.</i>

40
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:47,749
Will do.

41
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:08,446
<i>Why didn't you go to the police?</i>

42
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,151
<i>They said it was my fault.</i>

43
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:12,406
<i>For having trusted Moctesuma Valdez.</i>

44
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:15,485
<i>A conman who made millions</i>

45
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:18,605
<i>selling fraudulent products
to the immigrant community.</i>

46
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,661
<i>I lost it all, miss.</i>

47
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,817
<i>My home. My money.</i>

48
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:24,985
<i>I lost my self-respect.</i>

49
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,992
<i>It was a difficult time.</i>

50
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:34,070
But one day,
I Went to my mailbox...

51
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,434
And I received a...

52
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:37,168
An envelope. A package.

53
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:39,903
It completely changed my life.
It was like a...

54
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:41,473
A miracle?

55
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:43,949
Yes, ma'am.

56
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:45,584
A miracle!

57
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:49,722
Somebody returned everything
the conman had stolen.

58
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,490
It was them.

59
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:52,954
Mr. Alejandro Toledo...

60
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,446
And Emilio Sanchez.
They helped us.

61
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:59,628
The Robin Hoods.
Thieves who rob thieves.

62
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,996
<i>They were our heroes.</i>

63
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,928
<i>Thanks to them,
I was able to graduate from college.</i>

64
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:06,474
<i>Do you know where they are?</i>

65
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:10,736
<i>I never got the chance to thank them
for what they did for us.</i>

66
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,310
<i>Some say they work for the FBI.</i>

67
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:16,809
<i>Others say they wear disguises
so as to not be recognized.</i>

68
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:19,636
<i>But in reality, nobody knows
where they are.</i>

69
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,653
<i>They saved my life.</i>

70
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,618
<i>We need people like them.</i>

71
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:37,873
MEXICO CITY

72
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,067
<i>Sir, there's a young lady to see you.
She says it's urgent.</i>

73
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:46,073
But I don't think she's a customer.

74
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:49,505
- I told you to wait outside.
- It's okay, miss. Thank you.

75
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,877
I thought you'd be more... in shape.

76
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:00,154
Are you Alejandro Toledo?

77
00:08:08,187 --> 00:08:09,217
Alejandro Toledo?

78
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:11,329
The one they call Robin Hood?

79
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:14,834
Alejandro... Hood... Robin Hood.

80
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:18,041
No. I don't know Alejandro Hood.

81
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:23,206
Weird. I looked into him.
I know Alejandro owns this dealership.

82
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:24,549
Well, I don't know...

83
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:27,981
Look, please, I need his help.

84
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,382
I have a problem. We were robbed.

85
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,951
And I know Alejandro can help.
Please...

86
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,190
Here's some good advice.

87
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:40,062
Go to the police. They can help.
The station is two blocks that Way.

88
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:42,957
Good luck. Have a nice day.

89
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,527
I can't go to the police.

90
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,459
She owns the police.
She owns everything.

91
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:52,172
This is about justice.

92
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,680
We need him to do what he does best.

93
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:00,982
To rob a thief.

94
00:09:05,077 --> 00:09:06,347
You just found him.

95
00:09:09,782 --> 00:09:10,852
Okay.

96
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:14,362
SIX MONTHS LATER

97
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,169
Congratulations.
You've been caught red-handed.

98
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:26,011
Details.

99
00:09:29,335 --> 00:09:33,715
If you don't consider all details,
you will get caught.

100
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:38,051
The heist isn't made in the vault.

101
00:09:39,011 --> 00:09:41,551
The heist is made in the planning.

102
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,090
Excuse me?

103
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:47,255
Can you say it in English, please?

104
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:48,787
Yes.

105
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:50,688
I mean, yes.

106
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:03,271
Emilio.

107
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,910
You switched sides.

108
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:07,809
Alejandro.

109
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:12,287
No. I've always worked
for the good guys.

110
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:16,677
How the hell did you get in here?

111
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,760
You have serious flaws in Sector 3.

112
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:24,674
Your motion detectors are outdated.

113
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:29,444
And your surveillance cameras
don't work as they should.

114
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:34,411
I think it'd be wise
to go talk in my office.

115
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:35,533
Of course.

116
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,505
I shouldn't be seen
talking to a... thief.

117
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:42,222
<i>I'm already six months into this.</i>

118
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,078
- I need to do this.
- To do What?

119
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:45,246
Steal?

120
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,952
It's just the kind of heist
you and I do.

121
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:51,548
No. Used to do, Alejandro.

122
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:56,994
I am an FBI agent now.
If you do this job, I will arrest you!

123
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:01,399
On the other hand,

124
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:06,578
let's just say
you went to Santiago Guzman.

125
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:11,236
Santiago Guzman is not an FBI agent.
Nothing of the sort.

126
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:16,181
I don't know. Just maybe,
he could, perhaps...

127
00:11:18,477 --> 00:11:19,457
Help.

128
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,398
So what's Guzman up to?

129
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:33,731
Relax.

130
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:36,996
The market goes up
and it goes down, Mr. Nakatomi.

131
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:41,306
But, fortunately for you,
Santiago Guzman owns this town.

132
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,341
So, when I say to you

133
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:47,976
that your stock will have
a dividend yield of 22.46%,

134
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,340
trust me, it's gonna be raining yen.

135
00:11:52,511 --> 00:11:56,051
<i>Arigato</i>. And <i>sayonara</i>, Mr. Nakatomi.

136
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:57,178
<i>Sayonara.</i>

137
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:20,154
Casual Friday at the office?

138
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:24,947
The benefits of working from home.

139
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:30,559
- So good to see you, bro.
- You too.

140
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,100
What storm blew you out here?

141
00:12:33,686 --> 00:12:35,056
Still quite the wordsmith, eh?

142
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:37,968
- You look good.
- Thanks.

143
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:39,801
So...

144
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:41,596
What's this I see here?

145
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:45,341
People see what they want to believe.

146
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:49,669
Besides, nobody on Wall Street
was going to hire an ex-thief.

147
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:52,912
Tell me the truth.
What brings you here?

148
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:54,105
Something simple.

149
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,618
- An advance.
- Nice!

150
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:01,424
You've always
had a Way with words too.

151
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,889
I promised my wife
I was out of the business.

152
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:08,015
Hang on a second.
Hold this for me.

153
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:11,201
It's nothing bad.

154
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:14,934
I'm reformed too. See?

155
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,538
Have lunch with me.

156
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,444
You like Tex-Mex?

157
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:39,257
Didn't realize we were...
expecting company.

158
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,328
Alejandro.

159
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:47,863
So your old partner shows up

160
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:52,200
and just invites you to lunch?

161
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,838
Exactly. And he's also my friend.

162
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:56,907
And it's just Tex-Mex.

163
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,807
I Want you at home, not in jail.

164
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:03,005
Please, honey.
I promise, we're just going to talk.

165
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:08,649
The theoretical probability of doing
anything illegal is 0.00 percent.

166
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:09,958
Almost nothing.

167
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,580
Long way to go for Tex-Mex.

168
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,940
It's homemade.

169
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,350
Do you know what this is?

170
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:45,564
Mexico. Before the war
with the gringos, right?

171
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:46,798
Correct.

172
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:50,766
And after that war,
Mexico lost a lot of land.

173
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:55,703
But then, the Americans
had to contend with one little detail.

174
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,543
Mexican rancheros who owned land

175
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:03,142
on what became
US. territory overnight.

176
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,205
Exactly.

177
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:06,783
But the Guadalupe-Hidalgo Treaty

178
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:10,752
stipulated that the US.
would honor the rancheros' land

179
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,923
if the rancheros could prove
legal ownership.

180
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:16,493
There's always a catch, huh?

181
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:22,193
And to do that, they'd need to have
their original land grants.

182
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:26,442
And Without those land grants,
they'd be evicted.

183
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,099
Forcibly, if need be.

184
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:33,965
Then their land would be
claimed by the Americans.

185
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,810
But with those papers,

186
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:40,653
the Mexicans could prove
that their land belonged to them.

187
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:46,689
Legally. Forever.
To pass down generation to generation.

188
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:55,863
Someone robbed your land grants.

189
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,330
Tell me more.

190
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:07,736
Juan Ramirez was the patriarch
of this family.

191
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,480
<i>And was one of the few rancheros
who had his land grants.</i>

192
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:13,905
<i>He was an honest man...</i>

193
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:16,476
<i>...which is why
the other ranchers trusted him</i>

194
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:17,845
<i>to keep all their land grants safe.</i>

195
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,680
<i>So he hid them in a secret spot,</i>

196
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:24,559
<i>somewhere on his property,
that only he knew.</i>

197
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:29,497
<i>This was to keep the land grants
from the hands of the wrong people.</i>

198
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:34,102
<i>But it wasn't long
until the wrong people showed up.</i>

199
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,414
<i>Ned Kilroy was
a cold-hearted opportunist.</i>

200
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,040
<i>He didn't care about the treaty.</i>

201
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:49,779
<i>And he demanded that
Juan hand over the land grants.</i>

202
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:53,215
No, Mr. Kilroy. I'm not telling you
where the land grants are.

203
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,319
I'm asking you to leave.

204
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:57,822
Leave!

205
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,509
<i>Ned Kilroy searched for the documents.</i>

206
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,441
<i>But he never found them.</i>

207
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:24,318
<i>Nobody did.</i>

208
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:28,250
<i>The exact hiding spot
died that day with Juan Ramirez.</i>

209
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:33,563
The other rancheros blamed Juan.

210
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:37,293
<i>Because without any evidence
that the land belonged to them,</i>

211
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:40,129
<i>Kilroy stole their land</i>

212
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:43,995
<i>and built the town of Kilroy.</i>

213
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:48,836
<i>The Kilroys now own everything.
And have made millions as a result.</i>

214
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:53,705
The ranchero families became renters.
On their own land.

215
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,649
Then, six months ago...

216
00:17:58,377 --> 00:17:59,357
A miracle.

217
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:04,689
<i>Josefa Ramirez found the land grants.</i>

218
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:09,703
<i>Buried exactly where Juan hid them.
166 years ago.</i>

219
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:11,862
See? It's the original seal...

220
00:18:11,957 --> 00:18:14,897
<i>Josefa immediately called the sheriff.</i>

221
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:16,874
<i>And told him what she'd found.</i>

222
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,840
<i>Finally, the Ramirez family
could get their land back.</i>

223
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:24,301
<i>But she didn't know
that Sheriff Johnson</i>

224
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:26,543
<i>was in the Kilroys' pocket.</i>

225
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:33,277
<i>A man named Rex
would show up that night</i>

226
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:34,948
<i>and steal the land grants.</i>

227
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,688
<i>Now, Rex isn't your typical enforcer.</i>

228
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,633
<i>He's very superstitious.</i>

229
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:42,725
<i>Which is an advantage
we intend to exploit.</i>

230
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:45,431
<i>The land grants are now
in the Kilroy Resort,</i>

231
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:46,801
<i>on North Padre Island.</i>

232
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:53,941
Nice. Beautiful.

233
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:55,242
And a fortress.

234
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:57,167
I mean her. The blondie.

235
00:18:57,402 --> 00:19:00,322
She's our mark. Miranda Kilroy.

236
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:04,176
As conniving as
her great-grandfather, Ned.

237
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:13,257
<i>I take it you've
infiltrated the place?</i>

238
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:15,186
<i>Six months ago.</i>

239
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:19,992
<i>Heard she was looking
for a new trainer.</i>

240
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:26,241
<i>So I showed her
some of my qualifications.</i>

241
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:33,949
Took me a while
to gain her confidence.

242
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:38,383
But now, I'm always on call.
Even got my own room at the resort.

243
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:41,421
- Obstacles?
- Many.

244
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,530
Before coming to me, somebody tried
stealing back the papers.

245
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,056
<i>They were unsuccessful.</i>

246
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:50,394
<i>And almost got caught.</i>

247
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:54,859
Since then,
Miranda beefed up security.

248
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:56,714
<i>She's gotten very paranoid.</i>

249
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:00,509
<i>She now has armed guards everywhere.</i>

250
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:09,775
<i>Security cameras too. Everywhere.</i>

251
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:13,949
<i>But the real reason
for all the security is simple.</i>

252
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:16,023
<i>Miranda is facing a ticking clock.</i>

253
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:18,424
<i>In two weeks, a judge
is going to finally rule</i>

254
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:20,617
<i>on who is the rightful owner
of the land.</i>

255
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:24,333
<i>So it all comes clown to who presents
those land grants that day.</i>

256
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:27,973
<i>Which is why, until then,
she keeps the land grants in a safe...</i>

257
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,130
<i>...behind a poster of her one and only
opera performance in New York.</i>

258
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:35,337
<i>But that simple poster
is protected by a force field.</i>

259
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,850
<i>Rex has an amulet around his neck.
And that amulet is the key.</i>

260
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:46,081
<i>It deactivates the force field
around the poster.</i>

261
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:47,158
<i>Wait.</i>

262
00:20:47,479 --> 00:20:50,719
That amulet deactivates a force field

263
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:53,086
around a poster which conceals the--

264
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:57,828
Like I said, Miranda is very paranoid.

265
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:15,078
It's a complex heist.

266
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:18,618
But nothing we can't handle.
What do you say?

267
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,192
Thank you for the meal, ma'am.

268
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:31,826
Within the risk-return spectrum,

269
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:35,604
I'd have to classify this heist
as a junk bond.

270
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:37,901
Alejandro's plan isn't junk!

271
00:21:37,996 --> 00:21:43,136
It's a financial term, kid. It means,
high yield, but too much risk.

272
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:55,217
I feel bad for all these families.

273
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:58,562
But I can't get back
into this business.

274
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:00,658
I promised my wife.

275
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,190
The decision's been made.

276
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:07,158
Goodbye.

277
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,169
Alejandro.

278
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:22,578
Can I get a ride back home?

279
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:25,909
Yes. After you hear this last part.

280
00:22:26,745 --> 00:22:28,015
That's Fransisco.

281
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:29,777
Top of his class.

282
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,256
Wanted to be a lawyer.

283
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:35,761
But right now,
he has to work in a factory.

284
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:37,525
Margarita?

285
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,126
Excellent student.

286
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:42,098
Accepted into a school of medicine.

287
00:22:43,328 --> 00:22:44,858
She had to drop out. Why?

288
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,337
Because she's broke.

289
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:51,135
There's a lot of talent here.
But very few opportunities to show it.

290
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:54,513
Because they're forced to pay
high rents to Miranda.

291
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,820
Besides, it's not just that
we were robbed.

292
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,650
This affects everyone who lives here.

293
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:01,792
Look.

294
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:04,961
This will be
the Kilroy Cultural Center.

295
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:08,864
They Want to build it here.
Over our land.

296
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:15,303
See? She's determined to fulfill
her fantasy of being an opera singer.

297
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:20,167
If the judge rules in Miranda's favor,
she'll destroy everything.

298
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:22,773
They're going to kick us out of here.

299
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:27,205
It's our home. It's been our home
for generations. My God.

300
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:33,985
Please. Help us get justice.

301
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:46,572
I'm not like you and Emilio,

302
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:49,902
where you pull a job
and give away the money.

303
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,442
Doing what's right is the best pay.

304
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:56,908
I knew you were going to get
all sappy on me.

305
00:23:58,703 --> 00:23:59,773
Partners?

306
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:07,382
Fine. I'll help you out.
On one condition.

307
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:13,092
I'm only going to consult.
In other Words, I'll just advise.

308
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:24,766
To do this job, we need specialists.
Highly skilled people.

309
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:29,881
Where are we going to find such people
on such short notice?

310
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:31,409
From around here.

311
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:33,507
From here?

312
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,375
- Yeah.
- Here?

313
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,377
Pure reverse engineering.

314
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:47,285
See what talents they have.
And build the heist around them.

315
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:48,725
Come on, now!

316
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:50,491
Great idea!

317
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:55,231
Why not hold auditions?

318
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:03,573
You already know me.

319
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:05,535
I'm Josefa. I'm a gardener.

320
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:08,167
But what's your real talent?

321
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:13,048
She's a molecular scientist.
But she's always frustrated

322
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:15,424
that nobody recognizes
her true genius.

323
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:25,231
Very good. She's in.

324
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:29,473
Next.

325
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:32,977
Next.

326
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:36,711
- I tell philosophical stories.
- Let's hear one.

327
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:39,111
There once was a man with great luck.

328
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,584
Every girl that he met said,
"Hey, you wanna--"

329
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,363
Next.

330
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:01,265
Not a talent!

331
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:04,604
I'm Mario. I like cats.

332
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:16,239
See this curl? Here, in South Texas,
there's lots of humidity...

333
00:26:16,808 --> 00:26:19,478
Horrifying hair. Too much frizz.

334
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:22,351
So I've spent years
training my friends

335
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:25,717
to recognize weather variations.

336
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,624
In order to save their hair.

337
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:29,486
Right, girls?

338
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:33,429
- Next!
- No, no.

339
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:39,272
Every con needs a good distraction.
And a woman is that distraction.

340
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,135
Nice to see you. What's your name?

341
00:26:42,867 --> 00:26:43,847
Maria Elena.

342
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:47,105
Jackie tells me
you can read tarot cards.

343
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:49,005
Yes. In my spare time.

344
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:54,277
I do spell work, consultations,
cleanings. I'm a spiritualist.

345
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:56,886
So you can predict the future?

346
00:26:57,082 --> 00:27:01,332
No, that's a clairvoyant.
I'm a spiritualist.

347
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:02,489
She's in.

348
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:07,795
My turn!

349
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,013
I'm Ray. I work at the ranch here.

350
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:19,882
I'm an expert on horses.

351
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,079
But as you'll see,
ladies and gentlemen,

352
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:28,318
today, I will demonstrate
how pain is all in the mind.

353
00:27:28,546 --> 00:27:30,646
This guy drives me crazy.

354
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:32,729
He drives me crazy too.

355
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:37,165
When the flame touches my skin,
I will feel nothing.

356
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,630
My body rejects pain.

357
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:49,873
See?

358
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,179
Nothing.

359
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:59,854
Because I've conditioned myself
to be impervious to pain.

360
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:02,148
Stop! You're gonna hurt yourself.

361
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:04,391
You can smell the flesh, right?

362
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:06,419
Sure. But I feel nothing.

363
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:09,489
For my next demonstration--

364
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:12,497
We've seen enough. Thank you!

365
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,358
He's in.

366
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:15,732
- What?
- Him too?

367
00:28:18,229 --> 00:28:22,869
He's Jackie's boyfriend.
Nice guy. Dying to help.

368
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:24,777
We'll find something for him.

369
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:27,236
What else are we looking for?

370
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:31,376
The key to the plan,
the resort's head of security.

371
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:34,853
He'll be accused by a Texas Ranger
of robbing their jewelry store.

372
00:28:36,014 --> 00:28:39,554
<i>That guard always ends up
working for the wrong employer.</i>

373
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:40,961
That's a good plan.

374
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:44,856
We've seen all the talent out there.
None of them are actors.

375
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:48,003
We need a real actor.

376
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:50,403
No Worries. I know one.

377
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,976
<i>He likes playing characters
that are...</i>

378
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:00,106
<i>Very complex.</i>

379
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,268
He's scary.

380
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,936
What the hell are you doing?

381
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:05,824
You're here to entertain the kids.
Not traumatize them.

382
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:09,388
Ma'am, I'm playing a hungry bear.

383
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:12,448
If a hungry bear
happens upon these kids,

384
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,594
he's gonna eat them. That's real.

385
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:17,529
I'm a method actor.
I keep things real.

386
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,096
You ruined my party.

387
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:22,127
I just wanted to entertain.

388
00:29:28,166 --> 00:29:30,806
This is a very risky job to pull off
with just a crew of amateurs.

389
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:33,740
What are you getting out of it?

390
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:34,852
Hey!

391
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,910
You may want to know,

392
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:41,319
Hurricane Inez is predicted to hit
North Padre in four days.

393
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:42,916
What a coincidence!

394
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,988
The hurricane doesn't worry you?

395
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:49,434
No. It's only a Category 1.

396
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:52,301
Well, maybe 2. So no biggie.

397
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,699
Tell me something, Jackie.

398
00:29:56,027 --> 00:29:59,767
Can you hack all communications
with this thing?

399
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:02,574
So they see only
What I want them to see?

400
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:05,881
Sure. But check this out.

401
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:10,907
I built this.

402
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:12,609
It's a transmitter.

403
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,955
Plug it into the mainframe,
and we're good.

404
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:18,317
Everything beams back to my computer.

405
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:22,856
Wow. I'm impressed.
You're very intelligent.

406
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:24,791
Yes, she's very intelligent.

407
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:26,863
Now ask her why
she didn't get into Harvard.

408
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:28,028
Not now, mom.

409
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:30,066
Better yet, ask that doofus.

410
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:34,738
It doesn't hurt.

411
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:40,774
What is it?

412
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:42,042
See where the mainframe is?

413
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:46,247
Right next door
to Miranda's penthouse.

414
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:47,691
Paranoid.

415
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:50,949
There's only one way in there.

416
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:51,989
Yeah, I know.

417
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:53,747
I'm on it.

418
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:09,738
Look who decided to drop by. What?

419
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:11,841
Tired of playing
with your little friends?

420
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:15,313
Come on. What friends?
You know I love you.

421
00:31:15,406 --> 00:31:16,936
But do me a favor.

422
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,945
Don't be mad at me.

423
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:21,988
Do I look mad?

424
00:31:28,253 --> 00:31:31,433
Relax, woman.
It's only a couple of days!

425
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:39,296
Good morning, friends.

426
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:43,472
Am I your friend?
Is he your friend?

427
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,208
- Let's go. Against the wall.
- Again?

428
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:52,146
Every day it's the same thing.
I'm here to train Miss Kilroy.

429
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:55,350
- She's expecting me!
- Then go on in.

430
00:31:55,780 --> 00:32:01,730
Welcome. Right this way.
Don't stare, I ain't that pretty.

431
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:11,426
Now that we're all here,

432
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:15,583
I'm gonna give you
your assignments. To avoid screw ups.

433
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:19,971
I already know mine.
Knock Rex out. Get that amulet.

434
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:24,214
For you, my friend, anything.
What do you need?

435
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:26,349
For me to sit. Got it.

436
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:30,154
Considering that Rex
has a black belt in Aikido,

437
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:33,658
is a weapons specialist,
and an ex-mercenary,

438
00:32:33,751 --> 00:32:36,391
not just you, but even four guys
won't be able to take him down.

439
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:40,401
Maria Elena when you gain entry
dressed as a maid,

440
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:43,102
your mystical powers
will play a key role.

441
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:47,495
Of course, with Josefa's help.

442
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:51,439
Her science skills will ensure
all of this runs like clockwork.

443
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:52,809
I get it.

444
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:55,041
- Miguelito.
- Talk to me.

445
00:32:55,506 --> 00:32:58,536
I need you to research
how to become a Texas Ranger.

446
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:01,979
You won't believe this,

447
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,750
but I've always wanted to play
in the Major Leagues.

448
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:05,518
I don't mean a baseball player.

449
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:10,785
I mean the elite police force,
The Texas Rangers.

450
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:14,431
Santiago.

451
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:17,704
What am I doing?

452
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:18,895
Ray.

453
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:21,374
Impervious to pain, right?

454
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,480
Haven't figured out
What to do with that talent yet.

455
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:26,615
Talent? What talent?

456
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:29,078
He's just a pretty boy.

457
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:31,453
I'm sorry, Ray. I am.

458
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:35,853
Don't mean to be tough on you,
but you are a bit slow, aren't you'?

459
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:43,429
Ray! I know what you're going to do.

460
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,595
You're going to rob the jewelry store.

461
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:46,987
What?

462
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:51,195
<i>Are you telling me you gave
the most crucial part of the job</i>

463
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,409
<i>to an amateur kid?</i>

464
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:57,148
Call it an honor among men
with bitchy mother-in-laws.

465
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,678
How're you doing, sir?

466
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,210
Mind if I mosey on over...

467
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:02,338
Hey, Alejandro,
how are you, my friend?

468
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:07,120
<i>You seem busy. I'll let you
get back to work. Keep going.</i>

469
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:08,191
It's all good.

470
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:12,390
And you? Who do you think you are?

471
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:13,797
Pancho Villa?

472
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:16,818
You asked me to dress
like a Texas Ranger.

473
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:17,961
So I'm dressed
like a Texas Ranger.

474
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:19,326
Take that off!

475
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:22,344
- That hurt, bro. It had glue.
- Come here. I need a favor.

476
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,740
Discreetly, look to your right.

477
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:27,266
See that girl in the middle?

478
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:29,865
- The one that has the big--
- Yeah, her.

479
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:33,308
I need you to train her
to play a meteorologist.

480
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:37,984
Play a meteorologist?
Why her? I'm the actor.

481
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:40,253
Do you watch Spanish TV?

482
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:41,324
Of course.

483
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,722
When was the last time
you saw a meteorologist

484
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:47,345
who wasn't in a short dress,
with a smoking bod?

485
00:34:49,053 --> 00:34:50,033
Good point.

486
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:52,556
How're you doing, ladies?

487
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,097
Oh, great. Are you gonna turn me in...

488
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:56,395
Oh, Virgin of Guadalupe!

489
00:34:57,995 --> 00:35:00,935
Nobody's going to believe
that that clown is a Texas Ranger.

490
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:03,666
Just wait till I'm done with this.

491
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:05,475
I'll transform the digital model

492
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,813
into an actual solid object
using an additive process

493
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:09,345
where successive layers are laid down

494
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,320
in different shapes
that connect like a puzzle.

495
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:15,117
How did you not get into Harvard?

496
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:19,363
Wait a minute! You're falsifying
government credentials, Jackie?

497
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:20,464
Don't worry, Josefa.

498
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:23,331
If it gets traced,
it comes back to me.

499
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:24,764
She's using my laptop.

500
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:28,796
Besides, we have a friend in the FBI
looking out for us.

501
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,970
Why do I even try?

502
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:35,843
You could've said, "Wow, Jackie.
You're incredible with computers.

503
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,280
That's my daughter! She's awesome!"

504
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:40,183
But no.

505
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:42,582
Always with the criticism.

506
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:53,964
Excuse me.

507
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:00,733
I'm gonna take a shower.
Care to join me?

508
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:05,561
You should be so lucky.

509
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:40,760
I'm in.

510
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:43,825
Good. Now just connect it.

511
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:47,265
It just switched on. See anything?

512
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:49,735
Nice! I got it.

513
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:51,248
Good job!

514
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:57,249
It's fake. Rubber. See?

515
00:37:58,309 --> 00:37:59,289
Oh, good.

516
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:00,477
But this baby...

517
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:02,559
is real.

518
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:05,661
Helps me stay in character.

519
00:38:07,218 --> 00:38:08,558
How y'all doing?

520
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,630
There's a new sheriff
in this "barrio",

521
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,026
and he's flying "huevos".

522
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:19,796
I don't think Miranda Kilroy
will believe you're a Texas Ranger.

523
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:25,005
Everything you're doing
with the character is... ridiculous.

524
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:26,906
Look.

525
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:33,622
I don't need an amateur
who's never stepped onto a stage,

526
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,048
who's never performed for an audience,

527
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,090
talk to me about acting.

528
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:41,029
Me, a professional actor,
with more than 20 years of--

529
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,099
You okay, kid?

530
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:45,698
I think I shit myself.

531
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:48,598
But that didn't hurt.

532
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,144
False alarm.

533
00:38:58,836 --> 00:38:59,866
Super.

534
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:03,615
Tomorrow, we will do some weights.

535
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,158
What are you up to?

536
00:39:09,046 --> 00:39:10,176
What are you doing here?

537
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:12,651
You've been training me
for six months.

538
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:15,361
We're together almost every day.

539
00:39:17,154 --> 00:39:19,134
I give you a room in my resort.

540
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,060
I send you sexy pictures of me.

541
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:26,239
And you haven't made a move.

542
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:28,437
- I'm a professional.
- Bullshit.

543
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,505
Bullshit.

544
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,237
Listen, honey.

545
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:38,822
I'll explain.

546
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:40,507
I like you.

547
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:44,745
I want this to move past
a trainer-client relationship

548
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:47,989
into something more personal.

549
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:50,926
Sounds really nice.

550
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:54,587
Good.

551
00:39:57,595 --> 00:39:58,865
Do you know what
always makes me relax?

552
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:01,578
Music.

553
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:04,276
You probably don't know this about me,
but when I was a little girl,

554
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:06,308
all I wanted to be
was an opera singer.

555
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:09,024
But daddy killed that dream
real quick.

556
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,950
"Kilroys aren't dreamers," he'd say.

557
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:12,421
We are doers.

558
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,986
Which is why I'm building this.

559
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:25,694
The Kilroy Cultural Center.

560
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:30,501
This... will change Texas forever.

561
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,542
And this will be my pride and joy.

562
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:36,798
The Kilroy Opera House.

563
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:41,683
Now, I'll be able to sing
whenever I want.

564
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,240
You see, Alejandro,

565
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:47,716
I am a doer.

566
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:52,560
And I'll finally be able
to tear down that hick town.

567
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:56,594
And what about the people
that live in that town now?

568
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:00,129
What about them?

569
00:41:05,563 --> 00:41:07,413
Okay. That's Plan B.

570
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:10,738
If the hurricane turns away,
we'll use this one you created?

571
00:41:11,001 --> 00:41:12,841
- Yes.
- Nice.

572
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:15,077
At least I don't have to
worry about you.

573
00:41:15,339 --> 00:41:17,219
Wish my mom would think that.

574
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:20,752
- Sorry, gotta take this.
- Sure.

575
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:22,988
Emilio, I'm glad you called.

576
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:24,994
Why the hell are you calling me?

577
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:26,955
What do you mean, bro? You called me.

578
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:31,527
I've told you a hundred times.
I can't help you. I work for the law.

579
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:33,426
Bro!

580
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:39,099
But if I were able to help you,

581
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:41,784
I'd tell you,

582
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:45,813
there is no evidence
that Kilroy stole the papers.

583
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:48,543
Which means she has to be
caught in the act.

584
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:51,949
Stealing the land grants. Understand?

585
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:53,446
Understood.

586
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:13,429
<i>Hurricane Inez, only a Category 1.</i>

587
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,201
<i>Won't cause much damage.
But still be careful...</i>

588
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:17,909
That's it, perfect, perfect.
Beautiful.

589
00:42:18,502 --> 00:42:20,502
It's getting there.

590
00:42:42,993 --> 00:42:46,103
All you have to do is focus.
Understand?

591
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:49,076
Nonchalant. Do it in a fluid movement.

592
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:50,906
Like nothing's going on.

593
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:58,419
It's as easy as
taking somebody's underwear,

594
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:00,049
without lowering their pants.

595
00:43:00,177 --> 00:43:01,317
Okay.

596
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,060
Why would I need to
take somebody's underwear off?

597
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:08,593
Forget it, kid. It's just a saying.

598
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:10,633
People, hello.

599
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:14,731
That hurricane is turning away.
My hair is drying out.

600
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:17,635
Santiago, we gotta go to Plan B!

601
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:21,141
Hurricane Inez is turning away
from the resort. It's going away!

602
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:25,151
See'? Unlike my ex-boyfriends,
my hair never lies.

603
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:28,053
It's time to get going. Just remember,

604
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:30,738
the heist is made in the plan,
not the vault.

605
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:34,489
Ray. Come here, kid.

606
00:43:35,512 --> 00:43:37,792
- I gotta talk to you.
- Sure. What's up?

607
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:41,851
I was thinking,
when I get into the jewelry store,

608
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:44,692
I should throw myself
against the glass

609
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:47,268
like Rambo or Jean-Claude Van Damme.

610
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:49,598
I can't let you rob the store.

611
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:52,567
What? Why?

612
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:58,383
I've been perfecting my own technique.
I call it "Screw the pain."

613
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,478
My decision is final.

614
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:05,411
If you get caught,
you'll get 20 years.

615
00:44:05,876 --> 00:44:07,646
I can't take that risk.

616
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:09,685
I'll find something else
for you to do.

617
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:13,486
Fine.

618
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:16,799
Hey.

619
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:21,129
So, who's robbing the jewels?

620
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:41,652
Remember, ladies.
5:00 p.m., poolside. Don't be late.

621
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:02,474
- Can I help you with this?
- No, no.

622
00:45:03,834 --> 00:45:04,944
Housekeeping!

623
00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:10,282
Force of habit.
I'm used to entering that way.

624
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:16,022
What are you doing here?

625
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:19,293
You promised you'd set it all up
and then leave, Jackie.

626
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:22,090
- I'm staying.
- No, you're not.

627
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:23,756
Mom, nobody knows
how to use this equipment

628
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:25,304
better than me,
and you know it.

629
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:28,496
Relax, mom-in-law-to-be, relax.

630
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:32,296
If anybody messes with Jackie...

631
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,320
Lights out.

632
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:46,952
Get it? Lights out.

633
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:50,309
I should go.

634
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:53,626
I'll be in position.

635
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,462
And I'll be ready.

636
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:57,964
Okay? Bye.

637
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:03,591
Jackie, you lied to me.

638
00:46:05,796 --> 00:46:07,206
Well, we'll talk later.

639
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,149
Don't be upset with your mom.

640
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:24,156
Look, she sees you like a baby horse.

641
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:28,328
Like a newborn foal. All weak.

642
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:31,156
With skinny legs, trying to stand.

643
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:37,165
Trying to, you know...

644
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:42,074
I love you.

645
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:02,958
I'm on the beach, kid.

646
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,000
What? You're here?

647
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:07,069
Yes.

648
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:09,757
What happened to "only consulting"?

649
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:13,230
No, that'd be a bad investment.

650
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:16,110
I can't let you guys do this alone.

651
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,280
<i>Let's get the party started.
Release the hurricane.</i>

652
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:20,736
Initiating Hurricane Miranda.

653
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,428
Interesting...

654
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:42,298
Now we're talking.

655
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:44,843
Look this way. You're so hot.

656
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:47,570
I love this job.

657
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:54,876
People see what they want to believe.

658
00:47:58,609 --> 00:48:01,609
Santiago, before you go,

659
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:04,622
Ray wants to know
if you have anything for him yet.

660
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:06,619
<i>To watch your back.</i>

661
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:19,566
Why can't he see that I can be
an important part of this operation?

662
00:48:20,864 --> 00:48:22,744
Why does he treat me like an idiot?

663
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:43,794
BACK DOOR...

664
00:48:50,494 --> 00:48:51,604
I love this job.

665
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:53,799
Hello, girls.

666
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:57,538
Yep. I'm the guard here.
In charge of all the security.

667
00:48:58,368 --> 00:48:59,778
Tons of responsibility.

668
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:05,651
Damn it. Are you kidding?

669
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:12,759
<i>And you can trust my hair
more than the radar.</i>

670
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:17,256
<i>Frizzy hair means imminent hurricane.</i>

671
00:49:17,354 --> 00:49:23,104
<i>And judging by my curls,
the hurricane will hit tonight.</i>

672
00:49:23,193 --> 00:49:24,373
<i>So be careful.</i>

673
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:27,937
I love Spanish TV.

674
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:31,171
<i>The surfers will have
a great time though.</i>

675
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:34,583
Hello?

676
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:39,415
Sir. Sorry to disturb you.
I recommend you turn on your TV.

677
00:49:39,576 --> 00:49:42,016
<i>Hurricane Inez has turned back.</i>

678
00:49:45,782 --> 00:49:50,962
<i>I'm Tina. Hair, weather.
Weather, hair.</i>

679
00:49:51,054 --> 00:49:53,734
<i>This is an unstoppable
force of nature.</i>

680
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,249
- Good?
- So good.

681
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:13,746
Miss Kilroy?

682
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:16,385
I don't mean to interrupt.

683
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:21,227
But I thought you should know that
Hurricane Inez has turned back to us.

684
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:22,888
And one more thing.

685
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:25,500
There's a Texas Ranger
coming up to see you.

686
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:28,327
He says it's urgent.

687
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:31,699
Thank you for seeing me, ma'am,
on such short notice.

688
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:35,633
Thank you for seeing me, ma'am,
on such short notice.

689
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:49,624
Thank you for seeing me, ma'am,
on such short notice.

690
00:50:50,113 --> 00:50:52,563
Thank you for seeing me, ma'am,
I'm Chuck Norris.

691
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:56,458
You're Chuck Norris?

692
00:51:03,093 --> 00:51:05,803
I'm sorry. That was a joke.

693
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:09,712
Because he played the Texas Ranger
on that TV show.

694
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,810
It's a good one.

695
00:51:11,968 --> 00:51:14,708
I got it and it's funny.
Please, come in, Ranger.

696
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:21,845
- Please, have a seat, Ranger.
- Thank you, ma'am.

697
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:25,494
Pardon me for asking,

698
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:27,689
but you seem a little nervous.
Everything all right?

699
00:51:27,784 --> 00:51:30,894
Nervous? No, I'm not nervous.

700
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:32,761
No, no.

701
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:34,530
You mind?

702
00:51:39,329 --> 00:51:43,679
See, I've been all over Texas, Ranger.
Never heard an accent like yours.

703
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:46,581
What part of the Lone Star State
are you from?

704
00:51:49,506 --> 00:51:53,106
I'm from the, you know,
the northern, western

705
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:56,024
eastern, southern part?

706
00:51:57,914 --> 00:52:01,624
My poppy's Cuban, which makes me
more Southern than you are, ma'am.

707
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:07,657
So, the reason why I came here
to talk to you, ma'am,

708
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:11,361
is we got some information recently

709
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:15,629
about a possible suspect
here on premise.

710
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,679
I thought you might want to...

711
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:27,421
I ran his match. He's legit.

712
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:30,317
Just get rid of him.
He's ridiculous.

713
00:52:32,382 --> 00:52:36,232
<i>I don't think Miranda Kilroy
will believe you're a Texas Ranger.</i>

714
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,496
Opportunity.

715
00:52:48,632 --> 00:52:50,632
A lot of us fail in life

716
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:53,238
because of a lack of opportunity.

717
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:58,549
But when I look around
your gorgeous suite,

718
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:00,448
and it's gorgeous,

719
00:53:00,944 --> 00:53:03,194
I see plenty of opportunity.

720
00:53:04,881 --> 00:53:08,331
Opportunity for a thief
to rob you blind, ma'am.

721
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,260
Are you saying that someone's
planning on robbing me, Ranger?

722
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:17,356
Yeah, I get off at 11:00 p.m...

723
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:20,298
I'd like to buy you breakfast.

724
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,531
Clothing optional.

725
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:24,639
It's a joke. Forget it--

726
00:53:25,468 --> 00:53:28,348
Miss Kilroy! Hi! How are you?

727
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:30,971
I was just keeping an eye on the...

728
00:53:31,608 --> 00:53:33,418
- Hurricane for you.
- Right.

729
00:53:33,577 --> 00:53:35,987
- Thank you, Carlos, really.
- Thank you.

730
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,723
I'm sorry. Where are my manners?

731
00:53:39,282 --> 00:53:42,662
I Want to introduce you to someone.
Texas Ranger Danuza.

732
00:53:44,487 --> 00:53:45,987
Ranger.

733
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:48,433
How are you doing, Carlos?

734
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,359
You can have a seat.

735
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:54,305
Have a seat.

736
00:53:54,497 --> 00:53:56,167
Okay.

737
00:53:58,034 --> 00:54:00,384
Okay, now pick up the phone,

738
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:04,077
call Santiago
and tell him the jig is up.

739
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:08,312
I'm sorry, who? I have no idea
What you're talking about, Ranger.

740
00:54:08,478 --> 00:54:11,688
Boy, don't piss on my boots
and tell me it ain't raining.

741
00:54:12,115 --> 00:54:14,425
Were talking about Santiago Guzman.

742
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:19,696
The man set to rob the jewelry
store tonight with your help.

743
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:24,704
Okay, this is preposterous,
Miss Kilroy, I have no idea...

744
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:27,104
Boy, don't be using
big college words on me!

745
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:36,371
- What's that?
- It's the jewelry store alarm.

746
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:41,048
Look, that's him! That's him!

747
00:54:42,545 --> 00:54:44,715
Okay, Miss Kilroy,
I will take care of this.

748
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:46,448
Please, do not worry.

749
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:47,863
Okay, I'm sorry.

750
00:54:47,984 --> 00:54:51,334
- You're kidding me, right?
- I'm sorry. I'm a little nervous.

751
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:55,604
Section one! Section two! Report
immediately to the jewelry store.

752
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:57,732
I repeat, immediately
to the jewelry store.

753
00:54:57,827 --> 00:55:01,297
We have a code 10-bravo.
I repeat, a code 10-bravo.

754
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:03,168
<i>To the jewelry store, now!</i>

755
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:06,837
- You don't belong here. Go home.
- Yes sir.

756
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,090
So cute!

757
00:55:28,391 --> 00:55:29,871
Take that mask off.

758
00:55:29,959 --> 00:55:31,029
Consulting?

759
00:55:33,563 --> 00:55:36,843
Woman! What are you doing here?
This is very dangerous.

760
00:55:38,368 --> 00:55:40,208
Grab him. Go! Grab him!

761
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:41,677
Don't let him go, boys!

762
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:43,479
Hold onto him.

763
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:46,283
Forgive me. Men don't change.

764
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:48,883
I'm just a thief.

765
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,446
Carlos!

766
00:55:51,581 --> 00:55:53,121
My brother, I'm really sorry.

767
00:55:53,216 --> 00:55:56,196
I tried robbing the diamonds
as we planned, but I failed!

768
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:59,426
- I'm stupid, Carlos.
- Stop saying "Carlos."

769
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:02,969
I'm really sorry, Carlos.
Don't beat me again, please.

770
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:05,729
He beats me up all the time.
All the time he beats me.

771
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:09,112
He does pervy things to me.
He tries and tries, but I resist.

772
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,699
Look... He's crazy.

773
00:56:11,801 --> 00:56:13,581
Carlos, please forgive me.

774
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:16,210
I've never seen this guy in my life.
He's crazy.

775
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:23,161
So a total random mustachioed criminal
just happens to know your name?

776
00:56:23,313 --> 00:56:25,093
It's a set-up.

777
00:56:25,248 --> 00:56:27,058
I mean, look at him.

778
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:29,690
He's dressed in black,
all cat-burglary and shit.

779
00:56:29,786 --> 00:56:31,266
Who dresses like that?

780
00:56:31,921 --> 00:56:35,061
Cracked the case, dickhead. Boom

781
00:56:35,658 --> 00:56:37,758
I mean, who dresses like that, right?

782
00:56:38,128 --> 00:56:39,798
Thieves do.

783
00:56:46,002 --> 00:56:49,212
Good. You're here.
Everythings ready.

784
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:52,449
Listen. Everything works
with this remote control.

785
00:56:52,542 --> 00:56:54,452
Hide it in your uniform.

786
00:56:55,912 --> 00:57:00,882
- Josefa... I can't. I can't.
- Now what's wrong?

787
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:03,494
I can't do this.

788
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:07,797
This goes against my principles
as a spiritualist. I don't do this.

789
00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:09,801
Listen to me.

790
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:13,371
I admire your principles. Okay?

791
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:16,367
It's what I love most about you.

792
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:19,466
But, oh, my God, cut the shit.

793
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:29,456
CUT ALL RADIO COMMUNICATIONS.

794
00:57:30,847 --> 00:57:32,587
DONE!

795
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:42,267
Why are you guys here,
when all the other guards

796
00:57:42,358 --> 00:57:44,458
are pursuing the thieves
who robbed the store?

797
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:46,871
What do you know
about that, trainer-boy?

798
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:48,166
Nothing.

799
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:50,398
We're the firewall.

800
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:56,953
Sure. It's just I heard Rex
call for all the guards,

801
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:01,150
before the radios got out,
so I assumed...

802
00:58:01,244 --> 00:58:03,194
But that's none of my business.

803
00:58:05,448 --> 00:58:08,118
Come in, Rex. Echo One.

804
00:58:12,455 --> 00:58:14,895
Come in, Rex. Echo Two.

805
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:16,525
Anything?

806
00:58:18,394 --> 00:58:21,004
Pretend I said nothing.
She's very understanding.

807
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:22,737
When has she fired
anyone over small stuff?

808
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:25,803
Let's go get some coffee.

809
00:58:26,569 --> 00:58:27,879
I'll wait here.

810
00:58:36,279 --> 00:58:39,559
Let me go, man! Take it easy!

811
00:58:39,649 --> 00:58:42,319
I didn't do anything.

812
00:58:44,153 --> 00:58:45,433
Shit!

813
00:58:46,089 --> 00:58:48,069
That's far enough, boys.

814
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,466
I'll take this thief from here.

815
00:59:08,278 --> 00:59:09,658
The chubby guy!

816
00:59:16,152 --> 00:59:17,692
What are you looking at?

817
00:59:21,858 --> 00:59:24,598
Not bad for a retired ex-thief.

818
00:59:25,528 --> 00:59:27,238
Meet The Cobra.

819
00:59:28,298 --> 00:59:30,708
She has a lethal bite.

820
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,569
Don't you sweet talk me.

821
00:59:36,606 --> 00:59:38,416
You're all in on it.

822
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:40,288
The trainer too?

823
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:41,406
Yep.

824
00:59:43,146 --> 00:59:44,626
See you at the rendezvous.

825
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:51,193
What are you doing here?
I told you to go home already.

826
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:52,987
I don't work for you.
I work for Miss Kilroy

827
00:59:53,189 --> 00:59:54,289
Where are the guards?

828
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:55,874
They weren't here when I arrived.

829
00:59:57,293 --> 00:59:59,673
Echo One, Echo Two, what's your 20?

830
01:00:00,797 --> 01:00:03,837
I got to go find those two idiots.
I'll be back. And you...

831
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:10,717
Well, if you don't need me tonight,
I'll be here tomorrow as always.

832
01:00:12,075 --> 01:00:13,045
You know what?

833
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,520
A workout would do me good.

834
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:27,785
ELEVATORS!

835
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:28,890
DONE!

836
01:00:37,266 --> 01:00:40,296
Echo One, Echo Two, what's your 20?

837
01:00:42,338 --> 01:00:45,648
No. Sir! There's no elevator.
Don't go in there!

838
01:00:54,917 --> 01:00:55,987
You saved my life.

839
01:00:58,655 --> 01:00:59,895
How did you know?

840
01:01:01,224 --> 01:01:05,264
I can see things before they happen.
I'm a spiritualist.

841
01:01:05,828 --> 01:01:09,138
That's a clairvoyant.
This was clairvoyance.

842
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:11,142
I know! That's what I always say!

843
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:14,583
I'm both.

844
01:01:17,874 --> 01:01:19,154
I see darkness.

845
01:01:19,242 --> 01:01:20,922
Wait a minute.

846
01:01:28,951 --> 01:01:30,791
That darkness you see in me...

847
01:01:32,989 --> 01:01:34,589
How bad is it?

848
01:01:36,426 --> 01:01:37,456
Real bad.

849
01:01:38,094 --> 01:01:39,474
Yeah?

850
01:01:39,562 --> 01:01:41,562
- May I?
- Please.

851
01:01:50,273 --> 01:01:53,023
My visions go by fast.
But this one is very clear.

852
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:56,247
There's a woman behind you.

853
01:01:59,782 --> 01:02:02,232
You've done terrible things for her.

854
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:12,628
Hey, hon, what's bugging you?

855
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:15,706
I'll admit it. I'm jealous.

856
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:19,509
Jealous? Of what?

857
01:02:20,203 --> 01:02:24,173
Of you. That you got
to pull another job.

858
01:02:25,308 --> 01:02:30,618
I miss it. The planning.
The execution.

859
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:34,725
- Getting away with it.
- Yes.

860
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:38,162
That's the most important part, right?

861
01:02:38,254 --> 01:02:40,604
I don't know what's worse.
Being locked in here.

862
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:42,500
Or having to listen
to all this bullshit.

863
01:02:43,192 --> 01:02:45,872
You need to have a soul cleaning.

864
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:49,672
You can't live with this energy.
You need a cleaning.

865
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,796
You have to do it!
Before it's too late. This is no joke.

866
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:54,471
You need to save your soul!
Right now!

867
01:02:55,905 --> 01:02:58,215
I can't right now. I'm real busy.

868
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:03,953
As you wish.
But I'll just tell you this.

869
01:03:04,981 --> 01:03:08,621
There may not be somebody around
to stop your fall next time.

870
01:03:09,652 --> 01:03:12,502
Okay! Let's go to my room.

871
01:03:12,588 --> 01:03:14,358
No! Not your room.

872
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:16,904
It has to be someplace neutral.

873
01:03:22,765 --> 01:03:24,535
You'd better not be lying to me.

874
01:03:29,272 --> 01:03:30,312
Come in.

875
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:41,081
- Get undressed.
- Excuse me?

876
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:47,191
I need it all off, so I can
unblock all that negative energy.

877
01:03:50,193 --> 01:03:51,303
Of course.

878
01:03:51,394 --> 01:03:52,604
Keep your underwear on.

879
01:04:03,439 --> 01:04:04,779
It's cold.

880
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:06,651
I'll lower the AC?

881
01:04:09,111 --> 01:04:14,691
Also, I need you to remove the amulet.
It blocks your heart chakra.

882
01:04:14,784 --> 01:04:15,894
Impossible.

883
01:04:19,655 --> 01:04:20,855
Impossible.

884
01:04:22,258 --> 01:04:23,358
Listen to me...

885
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:26,944
You need to start
believing me right now.

886
01:04:27,096 --> 01:04:30,036
If not, there isn't anybody that
will clean that soul of yours.

887
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:31,566
If you'd prefer it, I'll leave.

888
01:04:44,413 --> 01:04:47,553
Put it there. On the bed.

889
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:55,760
Have a seat.

890
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:02,998
Frizzy.

891
01:05:05,268 --> 01:05:06,368
The hurricane!

892
01:05:12,642 --> 01:05:15,352
Damn, that storm is really coming.

893
01:05:15,444 --> 01:05:17,084
I can't breathe.

894
01:05:18,147 --> 01:05:20,087
I'm not going to work out.

895
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:21,352
Don't leave.

896
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:26,656
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's really...

897
01:05:29,825 --> 01:05:32,135
It's really coming.

898
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:47,591
Spirits of darkness,
I compel you to leave this man.

899
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:50,187
He will be good and noble.

900
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:51,819
- Don't promise much.
- Shut up!

901
01:05:52,415 --> 01:05:59,055
In the name of divine spirits,
I compel you to leave this body.

902
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:05,832
Be good as you should be.
Exit the darkness.

903
01:06:06,762 --> 01:06:09,212
Exit the darkness.

904
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:14,405
We're not scared of you!

905
01:06:14,503 --> 01:06:16,613
She speaks for herself. Not for me.

906
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:19,951
Housekeeping.

907
01:06:20,042 --> 01:06:21,322
Close your eyes.

908
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:29,520
I got it in here.

909
01:06:30,286 --> 01:06:31,356
Thanks.

910
01:06:35,691 --> 01:06:37,301
Where is my amulet?

911
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:44,370
Where is my amulet?

912
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:48,179
Who are you?

913
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:50,010
Who are you?

914
01:06:54,977 --> 01:06:56,677
You're a fake spiritualist!

915
01:06:58,481 --> 01:07:00,361
How dare you say that to me?

916
01:07:01,884 --> 01:07:04,064
I'm an incredible spiritualist!

917
01:07:13,496 --> 01:07:16,136
Darkness...

918
01:07:16,265 --> 01:07:18,705
Consume this man!

919
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:37,128
Nice job, Josefa.

920
01:07:43,492 --> 01:07:44,492
On, shit.

921
01:07:46,429 --> 01:07:48,239
The hurricane!

922
01:07:49,999 --> 01:07:52,539
HURRICANE INEZ
COMING TO US. FOR REAL.

923
01:07:53,302 --> 01:07:55,612
DO WE GO BACK TO PLAN A?

924
01:07:56,939 --> 01:07:58,889
OR DO WE STICK TO PLAN B?

925
01:07:59,341 --> 01:08:03,451
- Which is real? Which is fake?
- Real. Fake. I made that one.

926
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:07,350
BACK TO PLAN A.
INITIATE NEXT PHASE.

927
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:13,359
- Okay. Ready?
- Yeah!

928
01:08:14,457 --> 01:08:16,267
Bye-bye, electricity.

929
01:08:24,667 --> 01:08:28,577
That's our cue. Alejandro must
be wrapping up with Blondie.

930
01:08:28,871 --> 01:08:30,371
The power's out?

931
01:08:30,506 --> 01:08:33,076
I'm glad I spent a fortune
on generators. Alejandro!

932
01:08:33,175 --> 01:08:34,945
It happens. Well.

933
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:40,124
Don't worry. Have a seat. Relax.

934
01:08:40,382 --> 01:08:42,592
The power will come back
any minute now.

935
01:08:42,751 --> 01:08:48,601
I'll stay here to make sure
everything turns out fine.

936
01:08:50,993 --> 01:08:52,343
That's my girl.

937
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:06,918
- Did I bite your lips again?
- No. I ruined it.

938
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:10,420
Jackie, you should be packed up.

939
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:14,179
No, listen, Santiago.
When I out the power,

940
01:09:14,283 --> 01:09:16,703
it released the
automatic jail cell doors!

941
01:09:30,566 --> 01:09:32,336
WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

942
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:42,592
I'M ON IT. NO PROB.
SEE YOU AT THE RENDEZVOUS.

943
01:09:45,648 --> 01:09:48,928
Don't worry.
It's just something special I ordered.

944
01:09:49,752 --> 01:09:51,732
- Even with the power out?
- Of course.

945
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:53,304
You're the boss.

946
01:09:58,994 --> 01:10:01,134
I still have service.

947
01:10:01,463 --> 01:10:03,443
At least something works
around here still.

948
01:10:14,944 --> 01:10:17,724
Time to get out of Dodge, little lady.

949
01:10:42,638 --> 01:10:44,278
What are you... What the hell?

950
01:10:46,642 --> 01:10:50,592
Juan Ramirez sends you a message.

951
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:54,090
He wants his land back.

952
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:58,489
Wait.

953
01:11:00,289 --> 01:11:01,859
Ramirez.

954
01:11:02,658 --> 01:11:04,368
You're a Ramirez.

955
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:08,141
Yes. After today, yes.

956
01:11:09,565 --> 01:11:11,095
Look.

957
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:15,711
See this? I'm gonna go get our land.

958
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:36,503
Careful. Put it in the center.

959
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:50,670
Done. It's deactivated.

960
01:11:55,077 --> 01:11:57,607
There are backup lithium
batteries, geniuses.

961
01:11:57,746 --> 01:12:00,156
You'll never get it open
without the combo.

962
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:23,884
No.

963
01:12:27,142 --> 01:12:28,782
No land grants?

964
01:12:29,445 --> 01:12:31,385
No land grants in that safe?

965
01:12:34,450 --> 01:12:37,090
So strange. Who could have moved them?

966
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:38,526
Miss Kilroy!

967
01:12:39,154 --> 01:12:40,574
Miss Kilroy!

968
01:12:40,656 --> 01:12:43,466
It's a set-up! They framed me!
They're actually here to rob you!

969
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:46,503
That Texas Ranger
with the shitty southern accent?

970
01:12:46,595 --> 01:12:48,725
He's in on it. Your trainer.

971
01:12:48,831 --> 01:12:51,071
And some hot chick
who can really kick ass.

972
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,650
You can stop talking now.
I know that! They're in here!

973
01:12:53,769 --> 01:12:55,369
Go find them and kill them!

974
01:12:56,605 --> 01:13:01,415
I can't do that. I'm a security guard.
I'm not a killer.

975
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:02,850
I'm here to save you.

976
01:13:02,945 --> 01:13:04,745
Don't be a dumb-ass.

977
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:07,687
They set you up
to take the fall for this.

978
01:13:08,117 --> 01:13:10,387
I think I'm just going to free you
if that's okay.

979
01:13:10,486 --> 01:13:12,186
Where are the land grants?

980
01:13:13,822 --> 01:13:15,062
Alejandro!

981
01:13:15,924 --> 01:13:20,344
It has been 166 years
since a Kilroy killed a Ramirez.

982
01:13:20,829 --> 01:13:23,239
Stick around! We're due.

983
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:27,137
I got it.

984
01:13:27,269 --> 01:13:29,909
- Can you free this up a little bit?
- I'm trying.

985
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:42,082
Yeah, come here.

986
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:46,756
Carlos, watch the door.

987
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:49,662
- Don't let anybody out of here.
- Don't worry, Miss Kilroy.

988
01:13:49,758 --> 01:13:51,968
Unless they can Walk through walls,
they're hot going anywhere.

989
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:05,276
There's no safe!

990
01:14:05,741 --> 01:14:07,241
Where'd she hide the papers?

991
01:15:18,180 --> 01:15:19,890
Miss Kilroy, look!

992
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:21,862
They must've used some kind
of corrosive liquid

993
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:23,790
to burn a hole through the wall
and escape.

994
01:15:34,129 --> 01:15:38,509
<i>Good morning, South Texas!
Some storm last night, huh?</i>

995
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:41,640
<i>But it seems to have
passed with minimal damage!</i>

996
01:15:41,737 --> 01:15:43,307
<i>In other news...</i>

997
01:15:43,672 --> 01:15:46,742
I'm so happy. It turned out perfect.

998
01:15:46,842 --> 01:15:51,052
Just as planned.
But how'd you knock Rex out?

999
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:54,991
- How'd you manage that?
- I don't follow.

1000
01:15:55,384 --> 01:15:59,494
He just passed out.
How'd you do that?

1001
01:16:00,489 --> 01:16:03,299
Witchy, that's more your thing.

1002
01:16:05,127 --> 01:16:07,297
I'm going to check on the papers.

1003
01:16:11,867 --> 01:16:16,037
So, I did that part on my own.

1004
01:16:17,072 --> 01:16:20,652
Alone. On my own.

1005
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:23,080
See? She's a witch.

1006
01:16:30,185 --> 01:16:31,155
Don't listen to them.

1007
01:16:32,387 --> 01:16:34,887
People fear what
they don't understand.

1008
01:16:35,557 --> 01:16:37,537
I'm Cuban. That doesn't scare me.

1009
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:42,170
In fact, I find it sexy.

1010
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:52,614
Thank you, Miguelito.
Thanks for helping my family.

1011
01:16:53,208 --> 01:16:57,088
I know what it feels like
to have your land taken from you.

1012
01:17:09,925 --> 01:17:11,695
You move. You die.

1013
01:17:11,827 --> 01:17:13,307
Right, Sheriff?

1014
01:17:16,264 --> 01:17:20,214
So this is how the other half lives.

1015
01:17:22,337 --> 01:17:24,747
I can't believe you were so stupid

1016
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:27,650
to come back
to Ramirez Ranch, Alejandro.

1017
01:17:28,410 --> 01:17:31,690
Hello! I know where you live.

1018
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:37,600
Did you really think this was
going to have a happy ending?

1019
01:17:37,719 --> 01:17:39,159
That you'd all, I don't know,

1020
01:17:39,254 --> 01:17:42,064
ride off into the sunset
and live happily ever after?

1021
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:45,302
I don't think so.

1022
01:17:46,294 --> 01:17:50,714
This is no folktale, Alejandro.

1023
01:17:51,066 --> 01:17:54,536
And you? You're no Robin Hood.

1024
01:17:56,004 --> 01:17:58,884
The papers. Put them in the case.

1025
01:18:17,726 --> 01:18:19,326
Nice try.

1026
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:26,274
I want all of the land grants.
From all of the families here!

1027
01:18:50,692 --> 01:18:52,472
This land

1028
01:18:54,129 --> 01:18:56,079
and all of its riches

1029
01:18:57,132 --> 01:18:59,132
belong to my family.

1030
01:19:00,836 --> 01:19:03,436
No one will take them away from us.

1031
01:19:04,706 --> 01:19:08,916
Not 166 years ago, not today.

1032
01:19:12,013 --> 01:19:13,623
No. No.

1033
01:19:18,153 --> 01:19:20,163
No, Josefa. No!

1034
01:19:48,016 --> 01:19:51,726
If the market changes, you adapt.

1035
01:19:59,427 --> 01:20:02,597
This belonged to Juan Ramirez.
Good luck to you.

1036
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:39,980
Come on!

1037
01:20:49,077 --> 01:20:52,057
There's no way we'll catch them.
Now what?

1038
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:55,891
Go! This is why they
call you "jackass."

1039
01:20:56,384 --> 01:20:58,594
Take the other horse. We have three.

1040
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:00,320
Ray already took it.

1041
01:21:03,425 --> 01:21:07,025
Don't worry. I'm sure
Ray knows what he's doing.

1042
01:21:16,938 --> 01:21:19,038
Follow me. I know a shortcut.
Let's go!

1043
01:22:14,162 --> 01:22:15,572
Kill Alejandro, go!

1044
01:22:17,966 --> 01:22:20,666
Like stealing your underwear
without lowering your pants.

1045
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:22,479
You idiots! We were distracting you!

1046
01:22:22,570 --> 01:22:25,140
They got the case!
Shoot him! Shoot him!

1047
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:26,880
'Cause of all the distraction,
you idiot?

1048
01:22:59,841 --> 01:23:03,251
Let's see how you do
against someone who hits back.

1049
01:23:17,425 --> 01:23:21,565
Not sure if you've heard,
but I'm impervious to pain.

1050
01:23:59,367 --> 01:24:00,777
Okay, that hurt.

1051
01:24:09,310 --> 01:24:10,620
You okay, kid?

1052
01:24:33,068 --> 01:24:36,168
Don't move, kid. You've been shot.

1053
01:24:36,271 --> 01:24:39,081
Let's see. It went in. It went out.

1054
01:24:39,174 --> 01:24:40,554
You're fine.

1055
01:24:40,675 --> 01:24:44,275
Help! Someone help me!
I'm stuck in here.

1056
01:24:44,712 --> 01:24:45,782
Well, well, well...

1057
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:16,960
Really?

1058
01:25:17,245 --> 01:25:18,445
Si, really.

1059
01:25:20,415 --> 01:25:22,685
I've always depended
on the kindness of idiots.

1060
01:25:25,453 --> 01:25:26,733
Alejandro...

1061
01:25:27,856 --> 01:25:29,096
This isn't over.

1062
01:25:34,529 --> 01:25:35,869
Drop the gun.

1063
01:25:39,334 --> 01:25:40,784
Good boy.

1064
01:25:41,202 --> 01:25:44,712
To me, you got rid of
the gun too soon.

1065
01:25:44,806 --> 01:25:46,476
We could've used it.

1066
01:25:46,574 --> 01:25:48,184
Drop the case.

1067
01:25:50,512 --> 01:25:52,192
Drop the case!

1068
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:54,280
I wouldn't give it to her.

1069
01:25:54,382 --> 01:25:57,992
Sure, easy for you to say.
She's not pointing the shotgun at you.

1070
01:25:59,087 --> 01:26:01,157
Still, I wouldn't give it to her.

1071
01:26:01,456 --> 01:26:03,266
Enough of this!

1072
01:26:04,792 --> 01:26:08,642
Little girls shouldn't play with guns.

1073
01:26:10,932 --> 01:26:14,142
This is Texas, honey.
We always carry a second gun.

1074
01:26:14,235 --> 01:26:16,605
To me, you got rid
of that gun too soon.

1075
01:26:17,005 --> 01:26:18,675
We could've used it.

1076
01:26:37,926 --> 01:26:39,626
<i>Miranda Kilroy!</i>

1077
01:26:41,996 --> 01:26:43,266
<i>FBI.</i>

1078
01:26:44,465 --> 01:26:46,335
<i>You are under arrest.</i>

1079
01:26:54,742 --> 01:26:56,022
FBI! Drop the gun!

1080
01:27:03,084 --> 01:27:05,564
Hand in the cookie jar.

1081
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:07,900
You've been caught in the act.

1082
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:09,186
Thank you.

1083
01:27:09,290 --> 01:27:10,890
I got it the first time.

1084
01:27:11,125 --> 01:27:13,225
Wait. Wait a minute, please.

1085
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:17,896
So that's why you went back
to the ranch with the documents?

1086
01:27:18,766 --> 01:27:22,036
Because you knew Blondie would
show up to steal them again?

1087
01:27:22,136 --> 01:27:24,706
Well, well, well.
Aren't you a sneaky bastard.

1088
01:27:40,054 --> 01:27:41,764
What happened?
What did I miss?

1089
01:27:47,061 --> 01:27:49,871
I'm so impressed.
It's incredible what you can do.

1090
01:27:50,698 --> 01:27:52,228
I feel so...

1091
01:27:53,534 --> 01:27:55,314
I feel so proud of you.

1092
01:27:58,373 --> 01:28:03,483
Wait up. Are we having a
mother/daughter bonding moment?

1093
01:28:07,248 --> 01:28:08,588
I was wrong.

1094
01:28:09,717 --> 01:28:11,987
Ray is good. He's a good guy.

1095
01:28:14,756 --> 01:28:17,026
I know you're listening.
Come on out.

1096
01:28:19,294 --> 01:28:20,334
Look at him.

1097
01:28:24,999 --> 01:28:27,099
You have all my blessings,
from the heart.

1098
01:28:28,703 --> 01:28:29,773
Thank you.

1099
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:35,279
But promise that you won't
waste your talents like I did.

1100
01:28:35,376 --> 01:28:36,856
- Promise me.
- Hey, Mom...

1101
01:28:37,612 --> 01:28:41,582
You didn't blow your talents,
because you're not just a gardener.

1102
01:28:42,116 --> 01:28:43,986
I've always been proud of you.

1103
01:28:45,353 --> 01:28:46,633
You raised me alone.

1104
01:28:48,956 --> 01:28:51,326
You're the most... Hey.

1105
01:28:51,492 --> 01:28:54,442
You're the bravest, smartest,

1106
01:28:55,363 --> 01:28:56,873
and most loving woman I know.

1107
01:28:58,399 --> 01:29:00,139
- I love you.
- I love you.

1108
01:29:00,935 --> 01:29:04,535
And because of your example,
Jackie got into Harvard.

1109
01:29:06,941 --> 01:29:11,521
What? But... Didn't they reject you?

1110
01:29:12,847 --> 01:29:14,087
What?

1111
01:29:14,449 --> 01:29:15,619
You didn't tell her?

1112
01:29:15,883 --> 01:29:17,953
What?

1113
01:29:18,853 --> 01:29:22,133
It's just, the letter arrived
when the land grants got stolen.

1114
01:29:23,057 --> 01:29:26,697
<i>That day, I decided to stay
and fight for the family.</i>

1115
01:29:26,794 --> 01:29:28,144
You got in?

1116
01:29:28,229 --> 01:29:29,829
I got in to Harvard!

1117
01:29:33,935 --> 01:29:35,915
These kids grow up so fast.

1118
01:29:38,906 --> 01:29:40,476
Like I always say,

1119
01:29:41,275 --> 01:29:42,875
what matters most

1120
01:29:44,011 --> 01:29:46,051
is not numbers and percentages,

1121
01:29:46,447 --> 01:29:47,757
but rather, people.

1122
01:29:48,583 --> 01:29:49,993
You've always said that?

1123
01:29:51,652 --> 01:29:53,132
I do now.

1124
01:29:57,825 --> 01:30:00,195
I mean this. Thank you.

1125
01:30:02,263 --> 01:30:04,713
You have no idea what you've done
for my family.

1126
01:30:05,666 --> 01:30:07,606
No need to thank us.

1127
01:30:07,702 --> 01:30:12,152
And if the Ramirez family ever
needs anything else, just ask.

1128
01:30:12,273 --> 01:30:14,553
Actually yes.
There's one more thing.

1129
01:30:14,642 --> 01:30:15,622
Come, please.

1130
01:30:17,011 --> 01:30:18,251
That was quick.

1131
01:30:35,830 --> 01:30:36,870
Who are these people?

1132
01:30:37,064 --> 01:30:39,774
The other families.
whose land you saved.

1133
01:30:49,410 --> 01:30:51,190
And now, it's easier to imagine

1134
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:54,489
engineers and doctors
coming from this town.

1135
01:30:55,049 --> 01:30:58,119
Or lawyers, or whatever...
Depends on our dreams.

1136
01:30:58,219 --> 01:30:59,719
Thanks to them!

1137
01:31:07,328 --> 01:31:09,968
You see it. There it is.

1138
01:31:10,698 --> 01:31:11,768
What are you talking about?

1139
01:31:12,667 --> 01:31:16,547
The answer to your question.
What do I get out of this?

1140
01:31:17,538 --> 01:31:18,638
Helping others.

1141
01:31:31,118 --> 01:31:32,318
Thank you!

1142
01:31:59,247 --> 01:32:02,227
THE END

1143
01:32:24,038 --> 01:32:27,208
Where there is injustice,
they'll be there.

1144
01:32:27,675 --> 01:32:32,215
Where the strong abuse the weak,
they'll be there.

1145
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:34,930
<i>Reporting for Despierta America...</i>

1146
01:32:35,049 --> 01:32:37,389
Do you think they'll figure out
how we'll do this mission?

1147
01:32:38,853 --> 01:32:40,893
I'm an FBI agent.

1148
01:32:41,489 --> 01:32:45,029
How did you convince me
to do this job?

1149
01:32:46,127 --> 01:32:47,267
Simple.

1150
01:32:48,029 --> 01:32:49,939
Because this is what we do.

1151
01:32:50,765 --> 01:32:51,935
Hurry up!
