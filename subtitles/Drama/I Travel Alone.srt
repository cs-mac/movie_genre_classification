1
00:00:01,185 --> 00:00:02,486
(One day in April)

2
00:00:02,486 --> 00:00:04,486
Good to see you all.

3
00:00:04,486 --> 00:00:05,886
Nice.

4
00:00:05,886 --> 00:00:09,285
The fifth anniversary special was a success.

5
00:00:09,285 --> 00:00:11,355
It was perfect with Seung Ri, TVXQ,

6
00:00:11,355 --> 00:00:12,956
and Daniel Henney.

7
00:00:13,195 --> 00:00:14,726
- Some people are curious. - About what?

8
00:00:14,726 --> 00:00:16,366
About our days.

9
00:00:17,066 --> 00:00:19,035
They're curious about our days.

10
00:00:19,035 --> 00:00:20,566
So was I.

11
00:00:20,566 --> 00:00:23,066
I've actually checked it on social media.

12
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:24,805
- He posts a lot. - Me?

13
00:00:24,805 --> 00:00:26,336
- Yes. - What about you?

14
00:00:26,336 --> 00:00:28,205
Probably because you're a waiting actor,

15
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:30,275
you post so many pictures of you waiting.

16
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,015
- You post everything you do. - Really?

17
00:00:34,415 --> 00:00:36,815
(Various pictures of him while he waits)

18
00:00:36,845 --> 00:00:40,856
Other people here saw you went to see flowers.

19
00:00:40,856 --> 00:00:41,955
He did?

20
00:00:41,955 --> 00:00:43,455
With Choong Jae.

21
00:00:43,455 --> 00:00:45,625
Right. I saw it.

22
00:00:45,896 --> 00:00:48,525
Kian84 rarely posts anything.

23
00:00:48,525 --> 00:00:50,536
He uploads a post every 3 to 4 months.

24
00:00:50,536 --> 00:00:53,195
I don't want to look like an attention seeker.

25
00:00:53,195 --> 00:00:54,366
That's absurd.

26
00:00:54,366 --> 00:00:56,665
Why are you not on social media?

27
00:00:57,135 --> 00:00:59,435
I quit at some point.

28
00:01:00,036 --> 00:01:02,146
- It just doesn't make sense. - I mean...

29
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:03,976
Kian84 worries about looking like an attention seeker,

30
00:01:03,976 --> 00:01:06,516
but Hyun Moo is the original attention seeker.

31
00:01:06,516 --> 00:01:07,885
- It's what I'm known for. - Yes.

32
00:01:07,885 --> 00:01:10,146
If you were a king, he'd be...

33
00:01:10,486 --> 00:01:12,855
- the king of attention-seeking. - The king of attention-seeking.

34
00:01:13,086 --> 00:01:14,956
He'd be the king of attention-seeking.

35
00:01:14,956 --> 00:01:16,055
- The king of attention-seeking. - The king of attention-seeking.

36
00:01:16,055 --> 00:01:17,596
Well said.

37
00:01:17,596 --> 00:01:19,025
That's right.

38
00:01:19,256 --> 00:01:21,596
- Why are you not on social media? - He's busy dating.

39
00:01:21,596 --> 00:01:23,525
- Well... - That's my guess too.

40
00:01:23,525 --> 00:01:25,935
Do you have a secret account together?

41
00:01:25,935 --> 00:01:27,066
No.

42
00:01:27,066 --> 00:01:28,965
- A couple's account. - Attention-Seeker and Dhalsim.

43
00:01:28,965 --> 00:01:30,976
I'm 42. How can you think we'd have a secret account?

44
00:01:30,976 --> 00:01:32,575
You've been trying everything young people do.

45
00:01:32,575 --> 00:01:33,905
You celebrated your 100th day.

46
00:01:33,905 --> 00:01:35,275
- Their 22nd day too. - Exactly.

47
00:01:35,275 --> 00:01:36,745
You asked us for a dollar and seven cents.

48
00:01:36,745 --> 00:01:38,346
Why didn't you give us any money that day?

49
00:01:38,945 --> 00:01:40,346
I didn't have seven cents.

50
00:01:41,016 --> 00:01:42,116
(I Live Alone)

51
00:01:43,185 --> 00:01:44,616
(A perfect day for sports)

52
00:01:45,086 --> 00:01:46,786
(We haven't seen Hye Jin's apartment in a while.)

53
00:01:46,786 --> 00:01:48,355
It's been a while.

54
00:01:48,626 --> 00:01:50,456
(It's not even 7am.)

55
00:01:51,355 --> 00:01:54,325
(Hye Jin is preparing food.)

56
00:01:55,066 --> 00:01:56,766
(Cramped)

57
00:01:57,965 --> 00:01:59,695
(What's happening today?)

58
00:01:59,695 --> 00:02:04,305
My agency has a sports day for models today.

59
00:02:05,736 --> 00:02:08,446
- I've prepared lunchboxes. - What?

60
00:02:08,446 --> 00:02:10,146
(Surprised)

61
00:02:10,405 --> 00:02:12,516
44 models are participating...

62
00:02:12,516 --> 00:02:13,676
- as far as I know. - That's a lot.

63
00:02:13,676 --> 00:02:14,815
- It is. - Also,

64
00:02:14,815 --> 00:02:18,185
there will be other staff members too.

65
00:02:18,255 --> 00:02:22,386
So I was going to make 60 to 70 portions.

66
00:02:22,386 --> 00:02:24,456
- 60 to 70 portions? - That's impossible.

67
00:02:24,456 --> 00:02:26,495
- That's just impossible. - Na Rae.

68
00:02:26,495 --> 00:02:28,595
Not even a professional cook could pull it off.

69
00:02:28,595 --> 00:02:30,366
It's just too much.

70
00:02:30,366 --> 00:02:32,095
- You'd hurt your back. - Yes.

71
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,266
(Frustrated)

72
00:02:34,266 --> 00:02:35,836
What should I do? I don't have a rice paddle.

73
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:40,946
(She uses a kitchen tool instead.)

74
00:02:40,946 --> 00:02:42,305
You don't have a rice paddle?

75
00:02:42,676 --> 00:02:45,046
I found out after 10 years.

76
00:02:45,046 --> 00:02:46,516
You don't make rice at home?

77
00:02:46,676 --> 00:02:48,586
- She doesn't eat a lot of rice. - I don't use a rice paddle.

78
00:02:48,715 --> 00:02:50,185
Then what do you use?

79
00:02:50,185 --> 00:02:52,185
- A spoon. - I use a spoon too.

80
00:02:52,185 --> 00:02:54,456
- Me too. - It's because she eats little.

81
00:02:54,586 --> 00:02:55,856
(Surprised)

82
00:02:56,255 --> 00:02:57,956
I've never made this much rice in my life.

83
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:03,225
I already made a full batch the night before.

84
00:03:04,236 --> 00:03:06,595
(She has to prepare a lot of food.)

85
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:08,136
As much as possible.

86
00:03:08,905 --> 00:03:10,035
I need a lot.

87
00:03:11,336 --> 00:03:12,836
I'm starting a new batch.

88
00:03:12,836 --> 00:03:14,305
I have only one rice cooker.

89
00:03:15,676 --> 00:03:17,946
Dhalsim is surprisingly sweet.

90
00:03:17,946 --> 00:03:19,546
She's preparing lunchboxes for everyone.

91
00:03:20,345 --> 00:03:21,546
I need to add water.

92
00:03:23,086 --> 00:03:25,456
Oh, my.

93
00:03:25,586 --> 00:03:27,886
Use a bowl or something.

94
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,555
How much water do I need?

95
00:03:33,356 --> 00:03:35,666
Making rice is so difficult.

96
00:03:37,196 --> 00:03:38,766
(When she baked last time,)

97
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,435
(she used measuring cups.)

98
00:03:42,606 --> 00:03:44,905
(But it didn't help.)

99
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:49,076
That's too much water.

100
00:03:49,076 --> 00:03:51,076
- The rice will be sticky. - It's flooding.

101
00:03:51,076 --> 00:03:52,345
How do you know that?

102
00:03:52,715 --> 00:03:56,046
I can tell. The water should go just up here.

103
00:03:56,446 --> 00:03:59,086
(It's obviously too much water.)

104
00:04:02,025 --> 00:04:03,956
(Instead of moving on,)

105
00:04:03,956 --> 00:04:05,196
(she turns back.)

106
00:04:05,196 --> 00:04:06,625
The rice hasn't been soaked, so...

107
00:04:09,025 --> 00:04:11,066
It's not been soaked.

108
00:04:11,235 --> 00:04:12,836
- So I... - Are you making soup?

109
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:15,766
- I'm making rice balls. - Then you need even less water.

110
00:04:15,766 --> 00:04:17,136
The rice...

111
00:04:17,136 --> 00:04:20,035
would soak up the seasoning and become even stickier.

112
00:04:21,105 --> 00:04:22,506
Seasoned salt.

113
00:04:23,206 --> 00:04:24,545
Gosh, salt.

114
00:04:25,615 --> 00:04:26,775
Sesame oil.

115
00:04:27,345 --> 00:04:29,545
You put so much of both salt and oil.

116
00:04:29,545 --> 00:04:30,886
Rice balls need a lot of oil.

117
00:04:32,785 --> 00:04:36,155
The rice was sticking together and wouldn't blend with the seasoning.

118
00:04:36,925 --> 00:04:38,295
So I had to keep massaging them.

119
00:04:40,696 --> 00:04:41,996
It looks more like a rice cake.

120
00:04:43,396 --> 00:04:44,496
It became a rice cake.

121
00:04:44,496 --> 00:04:47,706
The rice was too sticky in the first place.

122
00:04:47,706 --> 00:04:48,836
That's right.

123
00:04:49,266 --> 00:04:51,605
And then you kept massaging it.

124
00:04:51,605 --> 00:04:52,806
- That's why. - It became a rice cake.

125
00:04:52,806 --> 00:04:55,775
It's rice cakes, not rice balls.

126
00:04:56,246 --> 00:04:57,715
(Rice cake)

127
00:04:58,446 --> 00:04:59,876
(The rice is ready.)

128
00:04:59,876 --> 00:05:01,446
How big should they be?

129
00:05:03,415 --> 00:05:05,485
Would this be big enough?

130
00:05:05,816 --> 00:05:07,016
What's that?

131
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,056
- They won't be able to finish them. - Look at that.

132
00:05:10,056 --> 00:05:12,196
It's a field ration.

133
00:05:12,196 --> 00:05:15,595
It's what Hyun Moo ate as a kid while fleeing from the war.

134
00:05:15,595 --> 00:05:16,925
- Carrying a bundle. - Carrying a bundle.

135
00:05:16,925 --> 00:05:18,436
My mom used to make them for me.

136
00:05:19,636 --> 00:05:21,006
They're models.

137
00:05:22,035 --> 00:05:24,105
Each of these would have 400kcal.

138
00:05:25,076 --> 00:05:26,806
(She's making calorie bombs.)

139
00:05:28,876 --> 00:05:30,105
I got the idea...

140
00:05:30,105 --> 00:05:32,475
from Na Rae's Summer School.

141
00:05:33,076 --> 00:05:35,415
- But the size looks so different. - You think so?

142
00:05:36,516 --> 00:05:38,186
(Na Rae's Summer School)

143
00:05:39,056 --> 00:05:40,386
(Na Rae prepared rice balls.)

144
00:05:42,225 --> 00:05:43,896
Roll it.

145
00:05:43,896 --> 00:05:46,525
They'd have to quit modeling after eating those.

146
00:05:46,956 --> 00:05:48,725
They'd make them fat.

147
00:05:49,025 --> 00:05:50,165
That's so much rice.

148
00:05:50,165 --> 00:05:52,636
They're going to play games using those.

149
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,735
They're going to throw them.

150
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:57,066
That's what it is.

151
00:05:57,066 --> 00:05:58,535
Now I understand.

152
00:05:58,535 --> 00:06:00,806
- Hey. - It's a ball that tastes good.

153
00:06:01,646 --> 00:06:02,775
Roll it.

154
00:06:03,605 --> 00:06:04,715
Ta-da.

155
00:06:09,146 --> 00:06:11,816
It looks okay. One is done.

156
00:06:12,256 --> 00:06:14,285
(A rice ball is done.)

157
00:06:14,556 --> 00:06:16,586
- She's doing a good job. - Right?

158
00:06:16,586 --> 00:06:19,155
She is, but...

159
00:06:19,496 --> 00:06:22,996
it should be completely covered.

160
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:24,865
(It's too little mayonnaise.)

161
00:06:27,266 --> 00:06:28,336
I feel too guilty.

162
00:06:28,336 --> 00:06:31,175
Adding mayonnaise and ketchup...

163
00:06:31,175 --> 00:06:33,576
makes me feel guilty.

164
00:06:33,576 --> 00:06:35,146
- I feel too bad. - But...

165
00:06:35,146 --> 00:06:36,746
You're already using too much rice.

166
00:06:36,746 --> 00:06:38,715
- It's too much. - Dhalsim usually tries to...

167
00:06:38,715 --> 00:06:40,985
eat less salt and everything,

168
00:06:40,985 --> 00:06:42,446
but why does she drink so much?

169
00:06:43,045 --> 00:06:45,316
- Exactly. - It's because she eats little.

170
00:06:45,316 --> 00:06:48,186
- She drinks so much. - Alcohol is not seasoned.

171
00:06:48,186 --> 00:06:50,355
She wouldn't drink if alcohol was salty.

172
00:06:50,525 --> 00:06:52,525
What kind of logic is that?

173
00:06:52,725 --> 00:06:54,725
She only cares about her total calories intake.

174
00:06:58,566 --> 00:06:59,636
I'm exhausted.

175
00:07:00,706 --> 00:07:01,865
Let me see.

176
00:07:04,136 --> 00:07:05,235
(Pressing)

177
00:07:06,775 --> 00:07:07,905
Who is it?

178
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:10,746
It's a rice cooker.

179
00:07:13,715 --> 00:07:15,016
Rice cooker!

180
00:07:16,785 --> 00:07:18,056
Who is it?

181
00:07:18,456 --> 00:07:20,725
- A rice cooker is here. - Rice cooker.

182
00:07:20,886 --> 00:07:22,956
- A rice cooker is here. - Are you Mathilda?

183
00:07:22,956 --> 00:07:24,095
Oh, it's Hyun Yi.

184
00:07:25,025 --> 00:07:26,725
(Korea's top model)

185
00:07:27,465 --> 00:07:29,066
(Hye Jin's good friend)

186
00:07:29,665 --> 00:07:31,035
(Top model Lee Hyun Yi)

187
00:07:31,196 --> 00:07:33,035
This is my first time here.

188
00:07:33,336 --> 00:07:35,735
- So? - I wanted to bring something.

189
00:07:35,735 --> 00:07:36,965
What did you bring?

190
00:07:36,965 --> 00:07:40,235
I brought a pointy plant that resembles you.

191
00:07:40,235 --> 00:07:42,076
How dare she!

192
00:07:42,076 --> 00:07:44,345
Daniel had that plant at home.

193
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,115
Did you memorize everything about his house?

194
00:07:48,485 --> 00:07:51,115
- I keep watching that episode. - Where did he have it?

195
00:07:51,655 --> 00:07:53,355
He had a big one in his garden.

196
00:07:53,655 --> 00:07:55,086
We thought it was an aloe vera plant.

197
00:07:55,086 --> 00:07:56,586
Oh, that agave plant?

198
00:07:56,586 --> 00:07:57,826
- Yes. - The big one.

199
00:07:58,225 --> 00:08:00,826
- I should put it here. - Yes. It's the perfect size...

200
00:08:00,826 --> 00:08:03,196
- for your bedroom. - I see.

201
00:08:03,196 --> 00:08:04,566
Thank you.

202
00:08:04,566 --> 00:08:06,436
Your place looks like a couple's apartment.

203
00:08:06,436 --> 00:08:07,865
All it needs is a man.

204
00:08:08,336 --> 00:08:10,506
- I have one. - Exactly.

205
00:08:11,105 --> 00:08:12,475
(Oh, my.)

206
00:08:12,475 --> 00:08:13,535
"I have a man."

207
00:08:13,535 --> 00:08:15,646
Hyun Moo looks restless.

208
00:08:15,975 --> 00:08:17,675
Is he hiding in the smaller room?

209
00:08:17,675 --> 00:08:18,775
(Joking)

210
00:08:18,775 --> 00:08:20,175
I was hiding in the other room like this.

211
00:08:20,175 --> 00:08:21,246
(Covering his mouth)

212
00:08:21,845 --> 00:08:23,115
(Funny)

213
00:08:24,556 --> 00:08:26,855
Look. This is one batch.

214
00:08:26,855 --> 00:08:29,355
The rice looks too sticky.

215
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:33,826
It wasn't at first. It looked okay,

216
00:08:34,196 --> 00:08:36,895
but as I massaged it with the seasoning,

217
00:08:36,895 --> 00:08:38,735
it became stickier and stickier.

218
00:08:38,965 --> 00:08:41,066
- You did what? - I seasoned it.

219
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:42,566
- Oh, I see. - She doesn't hear well.

220
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,505
- Oh, you seasoned it. - She's like us.

221
00:08:45,505 --> 00:08:47,206
Do we need more rice?

222
00:08:47,206 --> 00:08:49,345
- We need one more batch. - One more?

223
00:08:49,345 --> 00:08:50,845
That's why I asked you to bring your rice cooker.

224
00:08:50,845 --> 00:08:54,615
Try half a ball and see how it tastes.

225
00:08:54,615 --> 00:08:56,385
Okay. It looks tasty.

226
00:08:56,385 --> 00:08:59,215
- Try half a ball. - You put some stuff inside?

227
00:08:59,556 --> 00:09:01,956
I asked Seol Mi for the recipe.

228
00:09:01,956 --> 00:09:03,056
It looks tasty.

229
00:09:03,056 --> 00:09:04,095
(Enjoying)

230
00:09:05,056 --> 00:09:06,826
Are you sure you like it?

231
00:09:06,826 --> 00:09:08,796
(Are you sure you like it?)

232
00:09:08,796 --> 00:09:10,095
It's sticky.

233
00:09:11,735 --> 00:09:13,336
- Hey. - The rice...

234
00:09:13,336 --> 00:09:14,936
sticks to my teeth.

235
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:18,406
Is it supposed to be a rice cake?

236
00:09:18,776 --> 00:09:21,076
- I mean... - It gets between my teeth.

237
00:09:21,076 --> 00:09:24,345
(The rice gets between her teeth.)

238
00:09:25,015 --> 00:09:26,115
What?

239
00:09:26,345 --> 00:09:29,145
She can't speak because of the food between her teeth.

240
00:09:29,546 --> 00:09:32,015
Why don't we...

241
00:09:32,355 --> 00:09:34,885
call the gimbap place across the street?

242
00:09:34,885 --> 00:09:37,395
Gosh, I don't know what to do.

243
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,326
It's cool now.

244
00:09:42,095 --> 00:09:44,196
- Oh, my. - That looks so sticky.

245
00:09:44,796 --> 00:09:46,365
- Is that a rice cake? - What should you do?

246
00:09:46,365 --> 00:09:47,936
It's turning into a rice cake.

247
00:09:48,235 --> 00:09:50,436
Should we make rice cake soup?

248
00:09:50,706 --> 00:09:51,936
(Dumbfounded)

249
00:09:52,235 --> 00:09:54,446
I'll do it right this time.

250
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:57,515
Gosh.

251
00:09:57,515 --> 00:09:58,875
(She pours rice into the bowl.)

252
00:10:00,345 --> 00:10:02,985
(Spilling)

253
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:04,715
Oh, my.

254
00:10:04,715 --> 00:10:06,316
Dhalsim.

255
00:10:06,316 --> 00:10:08,656
But it all went into the bowl.

256
00:10:08,855 --> 00:10:11,255
What should I do?

257
00:10:11,255 --> 00:10:13,456
Let me make the rice.

258
00:10:14,095 --> 00:10:15,265
- No. - You should make pancakes.

259
00:10:16,395 --> 00:10:17,395
No.

260
00:10:17,395 --> 00:10:19,536
- You're a pancake expert. - What should I do?

261
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,965
Hyun Yi has a child. She must be a good cook.

262
00:10:21,965 --> 00:10:24,135
- She looks experienced. - She's very skillful.

263
00:10:24,505 --> 00:10:25,906
She's drying the rice.

264
00:10:26,176 --> 00:10:27,446
Eat just half.

265
00:10:28,176 --> 00:10:29,776
You'll have to eat all of them later.

266
00:10:31,615 --> 00:10:32,975
Tuna and mayonnaise rice balls taste okay, right?

267
00:10:33,515 --> 00:10:35,416
I think we should put more mayonnaise.

268
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:38,355
No. I feel too guilty.

269
00:10:39,086 --> 00:10:41,526
- What are you doing? - Tuna and mayonnaise rice balls...

270
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:43,426
are about the taste of mayonnaise.

271
00:10:43,426 --> 00:10:44,526
What are you doing?

272
00:10:44,755 --> 00:10:45,995
I'm eating mayonnaise.

273
00:10:46,725 --> 00:10:49,965
Did you see her add all that mayonnaise?

274
00:10:50,536 --> 00:10:52,036
A friend of mine carries mayonnaise around...

275
00:10:52,036 --> 00:10:53,865
- in her clutch. - She does?

276
00:10:53,865 --> 00:10:56,365
- Yes, she dips everything in it. - That's what Hyun Yi does.

277
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:57,436
Look.

278
00:10:58,836 --> 00:11:00,546
Are you out of your mind?

279
00:11:01,946 --> 00:11:03,046
This is it.

280
00:11:03,475 --> 00:11:04,475
(She shudders.)

281
00:11:04,475 --> 00:11:05,676
She said that's it.

282
00:11:05,676 --> 00:11:07,985
Tuna and mayonnaise rice balls have to be moist.

283
00:11:07,985 --> 00:11:09,916
Do you know how much mayonnaise is needed to make it moist?

284
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,355
I mix mayonnaise into my rice.

285
00:11:11,355 --> 00:11:13,316
- Why do you do that? - Because it's delicious.

286
00:11:14,426 --> 00:11:16,355
She eats a lot, but doesn't get fat.

287
00:11:16,355 --> 00:11:17,595
(This is good.)

288
00:11:17,595 --> 00:11:20,696
She doesn't get fat, but I do if I eat like that.

289
00:11:20,796 --> 00:11:22,666
If you're friends with someone like that,

290
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:23,865
you're the only one gaining weight.

291
00:11:23,865 --> 00:11:24,895
- That's right. - You're right.

292
00:11:24,895 --> 00:11:27,336
Do Yeon eats way more than I do, but doesn't gain weight.

293
00:11:27,406 --> 00:11:28,566
She's very thin.

294
00:11:29,936 --> 00:11:31,176
(I think it needs a bit more mayonnaise.)

295
00:11:31,176 --> 00:11:32,576
- Also. - Yes?

296
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:34,845
I thought about it...

297
00:11:35,306 --> 00:11:38,446
- You need at least that much. - Hey.

298
00:11:38,546 --> 00:11:40,145
She must be scared of you.

299
00:11:41,015 --> 00:11:42,316
We won't eat too much.

300
00:11:42,446 --> 00:11:43,745
It'll taste good this way.

301
00:11:43,956 --> 00:11:47,456
Do you know how many calories mayonnaise has?

302
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,485
We're going to exercise.

303
00:11:49,485 --> 00:11:52,495
- We'll jump around. - You must be out of your mind.

304
00:11:52,495 --> 00:11:54,265
It'll taste good this way.

305
00:11:54,595 --> 00:11:55,696
It looks delicious.

306
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,296
- I don't believe it. - That's right.

307
00:11:57,296 --> 00:11:58,465
That's how you make it.

308
00:11:58,465 --> 00:12:00,066
- That's how you should make it. - That's right.

309
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:01,166
It's tuna and mayonnaise rice balls.

310
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,265
(There is a difference in their tastes.)

311
00:12:02,536 --> 00:12:03,605
Look.

312
00:12:03,605 --> 00:12:05,036
(Watch how I do this.)

313
00:12:05,836 --> 00:12:07,706
Wrap it tight.

314
00:12:08,276 --> 00:12:09,676
She seems to be doing all the work.

315
00:12:09,676 --> 00:12:11,076
- She's good. - It's pretty, isn't it?

316
00:12:11,546 --> 00:12:12,875
- She's good. - This is how you make it.

317
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,916
I would've had a hard time if it weren't for Hyun Yi.

318
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,145
She's a good cook.

319
00:12:17,786 --> 00:12:19,515
I thought about it...

320
00:12:19,855 --> 00:12:23,656
and I won't tell everyone...

321
00:12:23,956 --> 00:12:25,426
I made this with you.

322
00:12:25,426 --> 00:12:26,755
- You won't tell them? - No.

323
00:12:26,995 --> 00:12:28,426
- Why not? - If I do,

324
00:12:28,426 --> 00:12:31,635
they'll be forced to eat it even if they don't want to.

325
00:12:31,635 --> 00:12:32,735
You know that, right?

326
00:12:32,735 --> 00:12:34,635
You do know.

327
00:12:38,475 --> 00:12:39,605
Are you still here?

328
00:12:40,105 --> 00:12:41,306
I'm here to stay.

329
00:12:42,046 --> 00:12:44,715
- Will you say you bought it? - Everyone will be asking...

330
00:12:44,715 --> 00:12:46,375
- each other to eat it. - No.

331
00:12:46,546 --> 00:12:48,115
They'll be telling each other to hurry up and finish it.

332
00:12:48,316 --> 00:12:50,485
"Hurry up and eat it. Hurry up and swallow."

333
00:12:51,316 --> 00:12:53,855
"Hurry up and eat it."

334
00:12:53,985 --> 00:12:55,485
"She's looking at us. Hurry up and eat it."

335
00:12:56,456 --> 00:12:57,556
Hey.

336
00:12:57,556 --> 00:12:59,656
(When did I do that?)

337
00:13:00,395 --> 00:13:01,765
That must've happened often.

338
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:03,166
(You seem to have a lot of fun together.)

339
00:13:03,895 --> 00:13:06,735
(They start picking up speed in making the rice balls.)

340
00:13:07,306 --> 00:13:09,406
We should've counted them as we made it.

341
00:13:10,306 --> 00:13:12,135
Oh, no.

342
00:13:13,406 --> 00:13:14,505
This is bad.

343
00:13:14,806 --> 00:13:15,946
It's okay.

344
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:17,715
I think we should start making the jeon.

345
00:13:19,776 --> 00:13:22,385
(They leave the rice balls piled up on the counter.)

346
00:13:22,786 --> 00:13:24,385
I'll start makingn the jeon.

347
00:13:24,855 --> 00:13:27,556
The whole house will smell of it when we make it.

348
00:13:29,656 --> 00:13:32,495
(She takes the air purifier to the kitchen.)

349
00:13:32,495 --> 00:13:33,595
Okay.

350
00:13:33,796 --> 00:13:36,426
I couldn't open the windows...

351
00:13:36,426 --> 00:13:39,395
because of the fine dust, but we had to cook.

352
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:42,306
Cooking creates a lot of smoke...

353
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:44,676
- at home. - You're right.

354
00:13:46,676 --> 00:13:49,745
I always turn this on before cooking.

355
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:50,975
You can stack more on top.

356
00:13:53,515 --> 00:13:56,316
(Hye Jin prepares the ingredients for kimchi jeon.)

357
00:13:57,255 --> 00:13:59,916
(She starts with chopping kimchi.)

358
00:14:00,556 --> 00:14:02,956
What are you making?

359
00:14:03,086 --> 00:14:05,395
- Rice balls and kimchi jeon. - Just two of them?

360
00:14:05,696 --> 00:14:08,125
You'll learn my true value now.

361
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:10,936
You'll be surprised...

362
00:14:11,365 --> 00:14:13,365
and call me the master of kimchi jeon.

363
00:14:14,936 --> 00:14:16,666
- You're the jeon master. - That's right.

364
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,375
- Jeon master. - We saw at Na Rae's grandmother's.

365
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,946
- She's really good. - Yes, she is.

366
00:14:21,946 --> 00:14:23,046
(The jeon looks delicious.)

367
00:14:23,046 --> 00:14:24,615
She's really good at making jeon.

368
00:14:24,615 --> 00:14:25,975
That looks delicious.

369
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:29,015
(She starts cooking the jeon.)

370
00:14:30,446 --> 00:14:31,615
(Carefully)

371
00:14:34,326 --> 00:14:37,595
(She is more careful than ever.)

372
00:14:38,456 --> 00:14:41,595
(She makes jeon to recover her image.)

373
00:14:42,765 --> 00:14:45,196
(She makes them into sizes that are easy to eat.)

374
00:14:46,995 --> 00:14:50,436
Shouldn't kimchi jeon have large pieces of kimchi in it?

375
00:14:50,605 --> 00:14:51,605
You're right.

376
00:14:51,605 --> 00:14:53,375
- Is that kimchi jeon? - Isn't it?

377
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:56,145
Isn't that kimchi water jeon?

378
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,475
Kimchi-scented jeon.

379
00:14:57,475 --> 00:14:59,816
Kimchi jeon is different from other types of jeon.

380
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,715
I used too little kimchi.

381
00:15:01,816 --> 00:15:05,086
It's different from the jeon we have at holidays.

382
00:15:05,186 --> 00:15:06,686
You have so many excuses.

383
00:15:06,686 --> 00:15:07,786
(The comment burns.)

384
00:15:09,225 --> 00:15:10,926
Are these too thick?

385
00:15:11,296 --> 00:15:12,755
That's not the problem.

386
00:15:12,755 --> 00:15:14,995
It doesn't have the ingredients it should.

387
00:15:15,426 --> 00:15:17,536
- You have to look closely. - It's called kimchi jeon.

388
00:15:17,635 --> 00:15:19,465
Oh, you're making kimchi-flavored jeon.

389
00:15:19,635 --> 00:15:20,735
Hey.

390
00:15:21,306 --> 00:15:23,105
- Like fake crab sticks? - That's right.

391
00:15:23,105 --> 00:15:24,105
(It doesn't seem like she'll be recovering her image.)

392
00:15:24,105 --> 00:15:26,375
- It's kimchi-flavored jeon. - No, it isn't.

393
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:29,446
I'll make a random rice ball.

394
00:15:29,446 --> 00:15:30,515
(She makes a random rice ball.)

395
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,875
- What is she doing? Hyun Yi. - Yes?

396
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:34,515
What are you doing?

397
00:15:34,515 --> 00:15:36,015
This won't be very spicy.

398
00:15:36,015 --> 00:15:39,255
You need to add at least this much to call it the unlucky rice ball.

399
00:15:40,286 --> 00:15:41,385
I don't believe it.

400
00:15:41,826 --> 00:15:44,026
(Who will get the random ball?)

401
00:15:44,426 --> 00:15:47,526
Are there any sports you're good at?

402
00:15:48,026 --> 00:15:50,965
My nickname used to be Carl Lewis.

403
00:15:51,865 --> 00:15:54,265
(Carl Lewis won the gold medal in the 1984 and 1988 Olympics.)

404
00:15:54,265 --> 00:15:55,436
Really?

405
00:15:55,965 --> 00:15:57,735
That proves how old you are.

406
00:15:57,735 --> 00:16:00,306
- There's another track athlete. - Ben Johnson?

407
00:16:00,306 --> 00:16:01,446
Not him.

408
00:16:01,776 --> 00:16:04,576
(Ben Johnson, Age 58, A friend of Carl Lewis)

409
00:16:05,115 --> 00:16:06,615
Ben Johnson?

410
00:16:06,615 --> 00:16:08,715
- She's talking about Usain Bolt. - Yes, Usain Bolt.

411
00:16:08,786 --> 00:16:11,816
Ben Johnson was caught for doping.

412
00:16:12,056 --> 00:16:15,326
Do you know we have good runners at our agency?

413
00:16:15,686 --> 00:16:17,926
That's just because they're tall.

414
00:16:18,156 --> 00:16:19,755
Everyone is tall.

415
00:16:20,225 --> 00:16:22,225
I almost became a basketball player.

416
00:16:22,495 --> 00:16:25,395
- Is that true? - Yes, when I was in middle school.

417
00:16:25,395 --> 00:16:26,765
(She dreamt of playing...)

418
00:16:27,936 --> 00:16:30,066
(at a basketball court.)

419
00:16:30,436 --> 00:16:31,706
(Do you know who that is?)

420
00:16:31,706 --> 00:16:33,906
That body doesn't suit you.

421
00:16:34,706 --> 00:16:37,145
(Hye Jin stretches her legs.)

422
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:38,875
I'm making you work too much.

423
00:16:39,145 --> 00:16:41,586
- Didn't I make a lot? - You really did.

424
00:16:42,546 --> 00:16:45,186
Everyone will get at least one.

425
00:16:45,816 --> 00:16:47,485
How many did you make?

426
00:16:47,485 --> 00:16:49,086
I think we made at least 80.

427
00:16:50,595 --> 00:16:52,796
We have to clean up and leave.

428
00:16:52,995 --> 00:16:54,296
You cooked rice the day before.

429
00:16:54,296 --> 00:16:56,196
It took us three hours to make that.

430
00:16:56,395 --> 00:16:57,635
We started at 7 am.

431
00:16:57,635 --> 00:17:00,095
That must have been tiring.

432
00:17:01,435 --> 00:17:03,205
Right? I woke up at five,

433
00:17:03,205 --> 00:17:04,935
actually 4:30 am.

434
00:17:06,076 --> 00:17:09,375
- Thankfully, the weather was nice. - It's such a relief.

435
00:17:09,845 --> 00:17:11,246
The weather is so nice.

436
00:17:11,246 --> 00:17:13,476
It's the best weather we've had recently.

437
00:17:13,476 --> 00:17:15,286
You're right. How did they decide on the perfect date?

438
00:17:15,286 --> 00:17:16,385
I don't know.

439
00:17:17,086 --> 00:17:18,516
Look at the weather.

440
00:17:18,885 --> 00:17:21,256
- The weather is nice. - It's really nice.

441
00:17:21,256 --> 00:17:23,056
- Where is this? - Han River.

442
00:17:23,226 --> 00:17:25,595
Isn't it such a relief?

443
00:17:25,595 --> 00:17:27,095
Yes, it is.

444
00:17:29,165 --> 00:17:31,796
- The weather is amazing. - Yes.

445
00:17:31,796 --> 00:17:33,466
- It was the perfect date. - It's unbelievable.

446
00:17:34,705 --> 00:17:37,105
We should have a sports day too. It sounds fun.

447
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,836
That would be fun.

448
00:17:38,836 --> 00:17:41,405
- Let's not play basketball. - No, we shouldn't.

449
00:17:41,405 --> 00:17:42,776
- Let's leave basketball out. - Okay.

450
00:17:42,905 --> 00:17:45,216
(During their game with Daniel)

451
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,316
(The ball goes over the hoop.)

452
00:17:49,746 --> 00:17:52,756
(They lose without being able to score a single point.)

453
00:17:53,586 --> 00:17:56,986
- What is your strongest sport? - What would you like to play?

454
00:17:56,986 --> 00:17:58,595
- Aren't you good at ssireum? - I'm good.

455
00:17:58,595 --> 00:18:00,726
- You're good, right? - Yes, I am.

456
00:18:00,726 --> 00:18:02,296
- I'm good at dodgeball. - Dodgeball?

457
00:18:02,296 --> 00:18:04,466
- It'd be hard to hit you. - You can't.

458
00:18:05,266 --> 00:18:06,736
How will you hit me?

459
00:18:07,135 --> 00:18:08,306
No one can hit me.

460
00:18:08,306 --> 00:18:09,766
I just walk around during the game.

461
00:18:09,766 --> 00:18:11,605
- That sounds like fun. - I've never run around.

462
00:18:11,605 --> 00:18:12,976
I walk around during the entire game.

463
00:18:12,976 --> 00:18:15,246
- You walk back and forth? - Yes.

464
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,276
I always participated in the relay race.

465
00:18:17,276 --> 00:18:19,476
You said you're good at basketball.

466
00:18:19,576 --> 00:18:21,216
Our opponents were too good.

467
00:18:21,546 --> 00:18:24,216
You were too bad at it.

468
00:18:24,216 --> 00:18:25,316
What?

469
00:18:25,316 --> 00:18:26,955
Are you the last runner of the relay race?

470
00:18:27,256 --> 00:18:28,455
Yes, I'm that good.

471
00:18:28,455 --> 00:18:30,895
- I'm a good runner too. - What?

472
00:18:30,895 --> 00:18:32,256
- I'm good too. - What are you talking about?

473
00:18:32,256 --> 00:18:33,395
You can't be as good as I am.

474
00:18:33,395 --> 00:18:35,566
Let's find out who is better.

475
00:18:35,566 --> 00:18:38,336
Yes, let's have a sports day.

476
00:18:38,435 --> 00:18:41,935
- Okay, when the weather is nice. - Let's bring a friend each.

477
00:18:41,935 --> 00:18:43,836
- Just one friend each. - Who are you going to bring?

478
00:18:44,036 --> 00:18:45,205
I'll bring anyone I can.

479
00:18:45,205 --> 00:18:46,506
Why don't you bring "It's Rain"?

480
00:18:46,806 --> 00:18:48,675
- That sounds good. - It's Rain.

481
00:18:48,746 --> 00:18:50,875
He's good at all sports.

482
00:18:51,246 --> 00:18:52,576
He is?

483
00:18:52,576 --> 00:18:54,786
We can't compete against him.

484
00:18:55,086 --> 00:18:57,685
- Hye Jin. - Don't bring Kim Dong Hyun.

485
00:18:58,016 --> 00:18:59,316
- That's right. - Why not?

486
00:18:59,316 --> 00:19:01,326
- You can't bring an athlete. - Of course.

487
00:19:01,425 --> 00:19:02,925
You can't bring an athlete.

488
00:19:02,925 --> 00:19:04,125
He can be the judge.

489
00:19:04,125 --> 00:19:05,796
He's a martial artist.

490
00:19:05,796 --> 00:19:07,425
- Come on. - Still.

491
00:19:07,425 --> 00:19:08,526
- Who should I bring? - Okay.

492
00:19:08,526 --> 00:19:09,966
- I think it would be fun. - Yes.

493
00:19:12,496 --> 00:19:14,336
- Look at the weather. - The sun is blinding.

494
00:19:14,405 --> 00:19:15,566
This is unbelievable.

495
00:19:17,306 --> 00:19:18,635
You're so tall.

496
00:19:18,635 --> 00:19:20,276
It's just the two of you, but I can tell you're tall.

497
00:19:20,276 --> 00:19:21,476
Hi.

498
00:19:22,046 --> 00:19:23,306
Hi.

499
00:19:24,476 --> 00:19:25,546
It's Jang Yoon Ju.

500
00:19:25,546 --> 00:19:26,816
Hi.

501
00:19:26,976 --> 00:19:28,915
- Hi. - She's much older than everyone.

502
00:19:28,915 --> 00:19:30,955
- It's someone we know. - She's like an archaeopteryx.

503
00:19:31,915 --> 00:19:33,016
You did a great job.

504
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:34,526
Yes, I did.

505
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:36,526
She's so tall.

506
00:19:36,526 --> 00:19:39,595
Yoon Ju, you're on Team White.

507
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,496
I'm on Team White as well.

508
00:19:41,496 --> 00:19:43,625
- We're on the same team. - You're on a different team.

509
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,195
Yes, but Hyun Yi was on Team White.

510
00:19:46,195 --> 00:19:47,306
(The teams were divided into black and white.)

511
00:19:47,405 --> 00:19:51,536
- I'll think of myself as a new... - Why would you?

512
00:19:51,836 --> 00:19:53,435
You've been a model for 22 years and suddenly you're a new model?

513
00:19:54,705 --> 00:19:55,945
I was talking about my attitude.

514
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:57,476
You always come last.

515
00:19:57,476 --> 00:19:59,476
I'll have a different attitude today.

516
00:19:59,845 --> 00:20:02,246
Go and sit in the shade.

517
00:20:02,246 --> 00:20:03,316
Your face might get too much sun.

518
00:20:03,885 --> 00:20:05,685
My daughter's name is Lisa.

519
00:20:05,685 --> 00:20:08,226
I was born again with her.

520
00:20:08,326 --> 00:20:11,155
It's been less than a year since I made a comeback.

521
00:20:11,425 --> 00:20:13,826
I'll do my best.

522
00:20:14,326 --> 00:20:18,095
I'm back with the attitude of a new model.

523
00:20:18,536 --> 00:20:20,665
Let's make a palanquin for her.

524
00:20:21,336 --> 00:20:23,306
Get on, Yoon Ju.

525
00:20:23,466 --> 00:20:24,875
Come here.

526
00:20:25,135 --> 00:20:27,845
She's practically an empress.

527
00:20:29,976 --> 00:20:31,875
Let's go now.

528
00:20:32,776 --> 00:20:35,246
Here comes the empress.

529
00:20:35,645 --> 00:20:36,986
I'm not my old self.

530
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,586
I was born again with Lisa.

531
00:20:39,586 --> 00:20:41,256
(I'm Lisa's mom and a new model.)

532
00:20:43,155 --> 00:20:45,425
You can go over there and take a nap.

533
00:20:45,455 --> 00:20:47,026
- See you later. - Good luck.

534
00:20:49,766 --> 00:20:50,865
(The models' sports day is finally revealed.)

535
00:20:50,865 --> 00:20:52,236
There's a field.

536
00:20:53,236 --> 00:20:54,435
Look at everything they prepared.

537
00:20:54,566 --> 00:20:56,006
It's Team Han and Team Yi.

538
00:20:56,066 --> 00:20:57,705
It must be Hye Jin's team and Hyun Yi's team.

539
00:20:57,875 --> 00:21:00,276
- Are you the team captain? - Yes.

540
00:21:00,645 --> 00:21:01,875
We're on different teams.

541
00:21:02,276 --> 00:21:03,806
(The model agency has everything set up perfectly.)

542
00:21:03,806 --> 00:21:05,476
That's impressive.

543
00:21:07,945 --> 00:21:09,345
They have so much prepared.

544
00:21:09,345 --> 00:21:11,056
- Look at that. - It's a bubble suit.

545
00:21:11,056 --> 00:21:12,385
What are those cameras?

546
00:21:12,556 --> 00:21:14,885
- They're broadcasting it. - I don't believe it.

547
00:21:16,056 --> 00:21:17,695
- Oh, my. - They're so tall.

548
00:21:18,726 --> 00:21:20,925
Look.

549
00:21:22,296 --> 00:21:24,996
- I'll have to stay away. - They're so tall.

550
00:21:26,566 --> 00:21:28,605
You can't tell we're tall...

551
00:21:28,605 --> 00:21:29,935
because everyone is tall, can you?

552
00:21:29,935 --> 00:21:32,476
- Everyone is the same height. - You're right.

553
00:21:32,476 --> 00:21:35,205
You're like a different tribe in "Lord of the Rings".

554
00:21:35,806 --> 00:21:36,976
Cho Min Ho.

555
00:21:36,976 --> 00:21:38,216
Hi, Hye Jin.

556
00:21:39,175 --> 00:21:40,476
Stop it.

557
00:21:40,476 --> 00:21:41,746
Don't do that.

558
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:44,185
Let's go.

559
00:21:44,185 --> 00:21:45,516
Come over here.

560
00:21:46,955 --> 00:21:48,855
Come over here.

561
00:21:48,855 --> 00:21:49,986
Let's eat.

562
00:21:50,826 --> 00:21:52,455
(Everyone claps.)

563
00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:54,195
Don't clap.

564
00:21:54,195 --> 00:21:55,796
I didn't make it.

565
00:21:56,095 --> 00:21:57,365
I didn't make it.

566
00:21:57,766 --> 00:21:59,165
Don't get it wrong.

567
00:21:59,395 --> 00:22:01,536
- Kimchi jeon. - I didn't make it.

568
00:22:01,665 --> 00:22:02,705
Try some.

569
00:22:02,705 --> 00:22:05,036
- Thank you. - Thank you.

570
00:22:05,036 --> 00:22:07,205
- Thank you. - Thank you.

571
00:22:07,776 --> 00:22:09,246
The sizes are all different.

572
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:11,546
- Pyeon Hee. - They're different.

573
00:22:12,445 --> 00:22:13,716
That's Jin Jung Sun.

574
00:22:13,945 --> 00:22:15,086
Who?

575
00:22:15,086 --> 00:22:16,286
She's a famous model.

576
00:22:16,286 --> 00:22:17,486
- It's Hae Na. - Yes.

577
00:22:19,316 --> 00:22:20,885
Is that man a soldier?

578
00:22:21,086 --> 00:22:22,355
Is he on leave?

579
00:22:22,355 --> 00:22:24,425
It's Jung Hyuk. I know all the models.

580
00:22:24,595 --> 00:22:25,796
How do you know so many?

581
00:22:25,796 --> 00:22:27,395
- How do you know so many? - I like them.

582
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:29,466
They have something I don't.

583
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:33,266
Do they like it?

584
00:22:33,665 --> 00:22:35,435
- How's it? - It's good.

585
00:22:35,435 --> 00:22:36,836
How is that possible?

586
00:22:37,165 --> 00:22:38,476
Come over here.

587
00:22:38,935 --> 00:22:40,645
It's good, isn't it?

588
00:22:40,645 --> 00:22:42,476
Yoon Ju is enjoying hers.

589
00:22:42,746 --> 00:22:44,076
Take your name tags.

590
00:22:44,076 --> 00:22:46,076
Wear your name tags.

591
00:22:46,546 --> 00:22:48,516
- It's wasabi. - Wasabi?

592
00:22:48,516 --> 00:22:49,716
(He got the wasabi rice ball.)

593
00:22:50,316 --> 00:22:52,086
I should make a random rice ball.

594
00:22:52,685 --> 00:22:55,955
You need to add this much for the person to realize he got unlucky.

595
00:22:56,786 --> 00:22:58,756
It was a random rice ball.

596
00:22:59,095 --> 00:23:00,296
It's in a few.

597
00:23:00,455 --> 00:23:02,496
- It has too much wasabi. - Hyun Yi did it.

598
00:23:04,095 --> 00:23:05,395
I was surprised.

599
00:23:06,395 --> 00:23:07,736
I was so surprised.

600
00:23:08,566 --> 00:23:11,506
No wonder it tasted weird.

601
00:23:11,506 --> 00:23:12,605
Is he on leave?

602
00:23:12,675 --> 00:23:14,246
No, that's just his hairstyle.

603
00:23:14,246 --> 00:23:15,506
That's his hair.

604
00:23:15,506 --> 00:23:16,645
Look.

605
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,316
He looks like Lee Jae Soo.

606
00:23:19,145 --> 00:23:21,345
He looks like he's a marine.

607
00:23:21,486 --> 00:23:22,615
Hyun Yi.

608
00:23:22,615 --> 00:23:23,746
(She feels bad.)

609
00:23:24,086 --> 00:23:25,355
Isn't it wasabi?

610
00:23:25,885 --> 00:23:27,226
It wasn't very spicy.

611
00:23:27,955 --> 00:23:29,326
Is this kimchi jeon?

612
00:23:30,996 --> 00:23:32,226
The color is weird.

613
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:36,826
(What do they think of the kimchi jeon?)

614
00:23:37,435 --> 00:23:39,165
- The kimchi jeon is salty. - Hey.

615
00:23:39,665 --> 00:23:40,865
What did you just say?

616
00:23:41,006 --> 00:23:43,435
Hyun Yi must've added salt to it.

617
00:23:43,435 --> 00:23:44,536
I made it.

618
00:23:47,105 --> 00:23:48,776
I was surprised when I tried it.

619
00:23:49,205 --> 00:23:51,375
How were we supposed to eat that?

620
00:23:51,716 --> 00:23:53,445
It should've been cooked to a crisp,

621
00:23:53,445 --> 00:23:55,885
- but it was barely cooked. - It must've been rare.

622
00:23:55,885 --> 00:23:57,516
She can't seem to say anything to Hye Jin.

623
00:23:57,516 --> 00:23:58,685
It was a disappointment.

624
00:23:58,955 --> 00:24:01,385
It smells like kimchi, but tastes like flour.

625
00:24:02,885 --> 00:24:04,895
It was salty and I was disappointed.

626
00:24:04,955 --> 00:24:06,526
- Oh, no. - Hey.

627
00:24:06,655 --> 00:24:09,095
How are you going to handle the aftermath, Hae Na?

628
00:24:09,996 --> 00:24:11,935
We will begin with having the athletes' parade.

629
00:24:11,935 --> 00:24:14,105
Why are we having a parade?

630
00:24:14,966 --> 00:24:16,466
What's a parade?

631
00:24:16,466 --> 00:24:17,635
You'll find out.

632
00:24:17,635 --> 00:24:20,076
- It's part of the ceremony. - Do you line up in fours?

633
00:24:20,135 --> 00:24:22,875
Do you mean walking in with the flag?

634
00:24:23,046 --> 00:24:25,016
Yes, even the idols do it.

635
00:24:25,216 --> 00:24:28,445
Please stand in lines of two.

636
00:24:29,816 --> 00:24:31,016
Everyone.

637
00:24:31,915 --> 00:24:33,516
Let's line up.

638
00:24:34,086 --> 00:24:35,226
Everyone?

639
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:37,726
Hurry up.

640
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,756
Hyun Yi, can you come this way?

641
00:24:39,756 --> 00:24:41,925
Line up before the other team does.

642
00:24:43,226 --> 00:24:44,895
Nice, nice.

643
00:24:45,036 --> 00:24:47,165
It looks like bootcamp.

644
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:48,705
Can we stand over there?

645
00:24:48,705 --> 00:24:49,766
It reminds me of bootcamp.

646
00:24:49,766 --> 00:24:51,635
She's like a marine.

647
00:24:51,635 --> 00:24:52,635
(The commanding officer is satisfied with the men that follow orders.)

648
00:24:52,635 --> 00:24:54,105
That's good.

649
00:24:54,845 --> 00:24:57,076
- We're ready. - That team is ready.

650
00:24:57,076 --> 00:24:59,145
You need to be like that.

651
00:24:59,145 --> 00:25:00,786
(She was eating and is late.)

652
00:25:03,016 --> 00:25:05,016
Team Yi is ready as well.

653
00:25:05,016 --> 00:25:07,685
Since you are all models,

654
00:25:07,685 --> 00:25:09,355
imagine you're walking down the runway...

655
00:25:09,355 --> 00:25:12,195
- as you parade. - Make sure you do well.

656
00:25:12,195 --> 00:25:13,966
- Let's begin. - Good luck.

657
00:25:13,966 --> 00:25:15,625
Team Han...

658
00:25:15,695 --> 00:25:18,236
goes first.

659
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:21,266
I actually don't like...

660
00:25:21,266 --> 00:25:23,236
being the leader of something.

661
00:25:23,836 --> 00:25:26,405
goes first.

662
00:25:30,476 --> 00:25:32,345
(She suddenly turns her model switch on.)

663
00:25:32,976 --> 00:25:34,516
Oh, my.

664
00:25:34,986 --> 00:25:36,216
Oh, my.

665
00:25:36,486 --> 00:25:37,586
You said you didn't like being a leader,

666
00:25:37,586 --> 00:25:39,086
but you went first.

667
00:25:40,385 --> 00:25:42,826
(The model that doesn't like being a leader...)

668
00:25:42,826 --> 00:25:44,756
(struts confidently.)

669
00:25:44,855 --> 00:25:45,925
You're enjoying it.

670
00:25:46,326 --> 00:25:50,736
(Her facial expression...)

671
00:25:50,736 --> 00:25:52,635
(is as charismatic as it is when she is on the runway.)

672
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:54,236
Hyun Moo loves it.

673
00:25:54,566 --> 00:25:55,766
She's cool.

674
00:25:57,506 --> 00:26:03,576
(Dozens of models escort her from behind.)

675
00:26:03,576 --> 00:26:05,175
Oh, no.

676
00:26:07,345 --> 00:26:08,486
(She turns.)

677
00:26:09,246 --> 00:26:11,415
(I am Han Hye Jin.)

678
00:26:11,556 --> 00:26:12,685
Did you have a drink?

679
00:26:14,726 --> 00:26:16,155
That's enough.

680
00:26:17,756 --> 00:26:19,355
(They hold an emergency meeting after seeing Team Han parade.)

681
00:26:19,355 --> 00:26:20,695
Yoon Ju is upset.

682
00:26:20,695 --> 00:26:22,026
All right.

683
00:26:22,026 --> 00:26:24,736
Let's have Team Yi go next.

684
00:26:24,736 --> 00:26:26,496
(Team Yi parades next.)

685
00:26:27,435 --> 00:26:28,766
They are excited.

686
00:26:29,105 --> 00:26:31,105
I think Yoon Ju will show us something.

687
00:26:31,105 --> 00:26:33,205
The marine is excited.

688
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,945
- Are they comedians? - This looks like a comedy show.

689
00:26:36,645 --> 00:26:37,816
Comedy show?

690
00:26:37,915 --> 00:26:39,076
Look at Yoon Ju.

691
00:26:41,486 --> 00:26:43,986
She can't let you steal the spotlight.

692
00:26:44,556 --> 00:26:46,286
All right, line up please.

693
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:48,826
Can we all take a seat?

694
00:26:49,256 --> 00:26:51,955
Let's have the team captains come forward...

695
00:26:52,026 --> 00:26:54,566
to tell us how determined the teams are.

696
00:26:54,566 --> 00:26:56,566
Can you tell us...

697
00:26:56,566 --> 00:26:58,336
what your team strategy is?

698
00:26:59,036 --> 00:27:02,066
It isn't important whether we win or lose.

699
00:27:02,066 --> 00:27:03,205
We just hope to get closer.

700
00:27:03,205 --> 00:27:05,205
It's nothing more or less than that.

701
00:27:05,605 --> 00:27:07,306
Second place is not an option.

702
00:27:07,306 --> 00:27:08,506
Really?

703
00:27:09,006 --> 00:27:10,546
What was that?

704
00:27:10,615 --> 00:27:12,415
You shouldn't have done the interview.

705
00:27:12,415 --> 00:27:13,645
What was that?

706
00:27:13,675 --> 00:27:15,716
This is discordance between your words and actions.

707
00:27:16,786 --> 00:27:18,056
Let's do this!

708
00:27:18,556 --> 00:27:19,816
(Their eagerness is boosted.)

709
00:27:19,816 --> 00:27:21,786
Please hand the microphone over to Hyun Yi.

710
00:27:21,826 --> 00:27:24,556
How are you going to lead your team?

711
00:27:24,556 --> 00:27:26,726
We're Team White.

712
00:27:26,726 --> 00:27:28,695
We'll gather positive energy...

713
00:27:28,796 --> 00:27:31,395
and win today.

714
00:27:31,466 --> 00:27:32,595
That was boring.

715
00:27:32,595 --> 00:27:34,105
What does white have to do with positive energy?

716
00:27:34,165 --> 00:27:35,665
What is she talking about?

717
00:27:35,665 --> 00:27:37,105
Could you point out a member of your team...

718
00:27:37,105 --> 00:27:38,306
the other team should watch out for?

719
00:27:38,306 --> 00:27:40,105
You can see her.

720
00:27:40,746 --> 00:27:42,276
It's Jang Yoon Ju.

721
00:27:42,645 --> 00:27:44,415
Yes, I see her.

722
00:27:45,076 --> 00:27:47,216
- Suddenly. - She suddenly strikes a pose.

723
00:27:47,216 --> 00:27:49,786
- All right. - Jang Yoon Ju!

724
00:27:50,486 --> 00:27:53,016
I think it'll be a tight match.

725
00:27:53,016 --> 00:27:55,455
- Stop that. - Don't take it away.

726
00:27:55,655 --> 00:27:56,986
We'll make sure...

727
00:27:57,086 --> 00:27:59,826
their white uniforms turn black.

728
00:28:02,365 --> 00:28:04,966
- Look how dark she is. - I know.

729
00:28:05,066 --> 00:28:06,336
She is competitive.

730
00:28:06,766 --> 00:28:09,336
- Are you two rivals? - No.

731
00:28:09,336 --> 00:28:14,306
Hyun Yi and I were hosts of a designer survival show.

732
00:28:14,705 --> 00:28:17,276
Whenever there was something involving models,

733
00:28:17,746 --> 00:28:19,276
I lost.

734
00:28:19,276 --> 00:28:20,546
- You lost to Hyun Yi? - Yes.

735
00:28:20,546 --> 00:28:22,145
It's become a trauma to me.

736
00:28:22,145 --> 00:28:23,986
That's why you were so eager to win.

737
00:28:23,986 --> 00:28:25,556
Yes. That's why I wanted to win so badly.

738
00:28:25,556 --> 00:28:27,526
- She's competitive. - Yes, she is.

739
00:28:27,526 --> 00:28:31,256
You were rivals in shows.

740
00:28:31,256 --> 00:28:33,355
You were in "Devil's Runway" and "Sold Out".

741
00:28:33,355 --> 00:28:35,066
- You know everything. - Are you a model?

742
00:28:35,066 --> 00:28:36,526
- It was a secret. - Really?

743
00:28:36,526 --> 00:28:37,736
I'm a children's model.

744
00:28:37,865 --> 00:28:40,296
I wear children's clothes.

745
00:28:40,296 --> 00:28:41,935
I saw you on the runway.

746
00:28:42,205 --> 00:28:43,875
- She was on a runway? - I saw it.

747
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:46,036
- It was shocking. - Why?

748
00:28:46,036 --> 00:28:47,945
Can I talk about this?

749
00:28:47,945 --> 00:28:49,546
The male model held her head...

750
00:28:50,076 --> 00:28:52,816
- and walked in carrying her. - I saw that.

751
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:55,016
- I saw it. - He carried her.

752
00:28:58,086 --> 00:28:59,915
Attention.

753
00:28:59,915 --> 00:29:03,355
Let's give the team captains a hand for encouragement.

754
00:29:03,355 --> 00:29:05,726
Applause.

755
00:29:07,466 --> 00:29:08,595
(Excited)

756
00:29:08,695 --> 00:29:10,695
Why is Yoon Ju so excited?

757
00:29:11,595 --> 00:29:12,895
She didn't drink, did she?

758
00:29:12,895 --> 00:29:14,036
I don't think so.

759
00:29:14,506 --> 00:29:15,836
Before we begin the sports,

760
00:29:16,306 --> 00:29:18,105
we have to warm up.

761
00:29:18,105 --> 00:29:20,036
It's for your safety.

762
00:29:20,076 --> 00:29:22,445
Hold each other's hands.

763
00:29:22,576 --> 00:29:24,415
It's best to have fun...

764
00:29:24,415 --> 00:29:26,445
while warming up.

765
00:29:26,445 --> 00:29:28,145
Let's start this. Start the music.

766
00:29:28,145 --> 00:29:29,286
(They begin their warm up.)

767
00:29:29,286 --> 00:29:30,286
Ready.

768
00:29:30,286 --> 00:29:31,586
(They start moving to the upbeat music.)

769
00:29:31,586 --> 00:29:32,786
All right.

770
00:29:33,016 --> 00:29:34,726
1, 2, go.

771
00:29:34,726 --> 00:29:36,685
Hold your hands and turn.

772
00:29:36,685 --> 00:29:38,195
That's the typical recreation.

773
00:29:38,395 --> 00:29:39,855
That's fun.

774
00:29:39,855 --> 00:29:41,095
I had so much fun.

775
00:29:41,095 --> 00:29:42,526
Gather in groups of five.

776
00:29:47,966 --> 00:29:50,266
Hold hands and turn to the left.

777
00:29:50,266 --> 00:29:51,776
I got more and more excited.

778
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:54,105
I haven't heard that song for a long time.

779
00:29:54,175 --> 00:29:56,546
Gather in groups of seven.

780
00:29:58,516 --> 00:30:00,945
(We have seven people.)

781
00:30:01,445 --> 00:30:03,546
(Jump up and down, everyone.)

782
00:30:04,086 --> 00:30:06,885
- It looks like a college camp. - You're right.

783
00:30:07,016 --> 00:30:09,586
It's a game from over 20 years ago, but it's still fun.

784
00:30:10,086 --> 00:30:13,226
Cheering is essential on sports day.

785
00:30:13,425 --> 00:30:14,966
Let's have the team captains...

786
00:30:14,966 --> 00:30:16,726
stand in the center of the circle.

787
00:30:16,766 --> 00:30:18,595
It will be hard...

788
00:30:18,595 --> 00:30:20,266
for the team captain to lead the cheer alone.

789
00:30:20,266 --> 00:30:23,665
Pick one person that gets along with you well.

790
00:30:24,276 --> 00:30:25,605
Come on.

791
00:30:26,976 --> 00:30:28,175
It's Jung Hyuk.

792
00:30:28,175 --> 00:30:30,746
- He's a popular model. - I know.

793
00:30:30,875 --> 00:30:34,246
Make up a cheer for your team.

794
00:30:34,246 --> 00:30:37,685
The board members will be the judges for it.

795
00:30:37,855 --> 00:30:39,915
It's a secret.

796
00:30:39,915 --> 00:30:41,226
We're supposed to talk secretly.

797
00:30:41,226 --> 00:30:42,726
- He's cheerful. - Good job.

798
00:30:42,726 --> 00:30:44,955
I hope it's perfectly synchronized.

799
00:30:44,955 --> 00:30:46,655
- Perfect synchronization. - Yes.

800
00:30:46,655 --> 00:30:48,326
Watch this.

801
00:30:48,326 --> 00:30:51,836
You go, and you, then you at the end.

802
00:30:51,836 --> 00:30:53,905
- I don't understand him. - Me neither.

803
00:30:54,635 --> 00:30:55,665
What?

804
00:30:55,665 --> 00:30:57,736
We'll color everything black.

805
00:30:57,736 --> 00:30:59,635
- Right? - Yes.

806
00:31:00,546 --> 00:31:02,345
- What about the moves? - The moves...

807
00:31:02,776 --> 00:31:04,345
We'll have to think about it.

808
00:31:04,345 --> 00:31:07,286
I don't like to come forward.

809
00:31:07,286 --> 00:31:09,115
That's not like me.

810
00:31:09,685 --> 00:31:12,086
- How about this? - Think of a song.

811
00:31:12,655 --> 00:31:14,925
(There goes the discordance between her words and action.)

812
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:16,586
- Line up. - Okay.

813
00:31:17,395 --> 00:31:20,865
When I say ready, you move like this.

814
00:31:20,865 --> 00:31:22,665
Everyone in the back follows us.

815
00:31:22,895 --> 00:31:24,865
- I'll face them. - I'm starting to see it now.

816
00:31:24,865 --> 00:31:26,296
You go like this.

817
00:31:26,296 --> 00:31:28,605
Then you clap with everyone.

818
00:31:28,605 --> 00:31:31,276
Then here...

819
00:31:31,276 --> 00:31:33,705
"We'll turn everything black."

820
00:31:34,375 --> 00:31:36,345
That's good.

821
00:31:36,675 --> 00:31:37,746
(That sounds like a good idea.)

822
00:31:38,016 --> 00:31:40,345
One of the teams seems to be done.

823
00:31:40,345 --> 00:31:42,986
- We'll report first. - Then...

824
00:31:42,986 --> 00:31:45,455
- We'll turn everything black. - we'll grade you.

825
00:31:45,455 --> 00:31:46,955
There are judges.

826
00:31:46,955 --> 00:31:48,986
50, 100 and 150. Yes.

827
00:31:48,986 --> 00:31:50,756
That's it.

828
00:31:51,026 --> 00:31:52,326
Chant.

829
00:31:53,256 --> 00:31:54,466
Go.

830
00:31:54,695 --> 00:31:56,796
- Team Yi. - Team Yi.

831
00:31:56,925 --> 00:31:58,635
(Cheering)

832
00:31:59,836 --> 00:32:01,205
- That sounds good. - That sounds good.

833
00:32:01,205 --> 00:32:03,336
That's not bad.

834
00:32:03,336 --> 00:32:04,836
Really? Was that fine?

835
00:32:04,836 --> 00:32:06,506
- That wasn't bad. - That's pretty good.

836
00:32:08,205 --> 00:32:10,405
We'll win. It's worth trying.

837
00:32:10,476 --> 00:32:12,415
Here's your score.

838
00:32:12,415 --> 00:32:15,786
1, 2, 3.

839
00:32:16,385 --> 00:32:18,355
Make sure to wave right.

840
00:32:18,355 --> 00:32:20,685
They clapped. It's 400.

841
00:32:20,685 --> 00:32:22,955
Left to right. Left to right.

842
00:32:22,955 --> 00:32:24,895
(She teaches them the moves again.)

843
00:32:24,895 --> 00:32:26,056
Left to right.

844
00:32:26,056 --> 00:32:27,095
400.

845
00:32:27,095 --> 00:32:28,966
(It's a festival for them already.)

846
00:32:28,966 --> 00:32:29,996
400.

847
00:32:30,296 --> 00:32:31,836
Yoon Ju must've been very stressed.

848
00:32:31,836 --> 00:32:34,405
Team Han will begin now.

849
00:32:34,405 --> 00:32:36,006
(It's Team Han's turn.)

850
00:32:36,236 --> 00:32:37,935
Chant.

851
00:32:37,935 --> 00:32:39,036
Come on.

852
00:32:39,736 --> 00:32:40,905
They're at odds.

853
00:32:41,776 --> 00:32:42,945
Chant.

854
00:32:43,746 --> 00:32:44,875
Go.

855
00:32:45,915 --> 00:32:47,046
- What's she doing? - What's she doing?

856
00:32:47,945 --> 00:32:49,115
- What's she doing? - What's that?

857
00:32:49,115 --> 00:32:51,516
- That's terrible. - Oh, dear.

858
00:32:52,756 --> 00:32:54,256
Hye Jin's excited alone.

859
00:32:55,226 --> 00:32:56,925
You're running like an idiot.

860
00:32:57,226 --> 00:32:59,095
- What's she doing? - She's excited alone.

861
00:33:00,496 --> 00:33:02,095
(They're lost for words.)

862
00:33:02,226 --> 00:33:03,796
- 1, 2... - 3.

863
00:33:03,796 --> 00:33:06,135
- We'll turn everything black. - We'll turn everything black.

864
00:33:06,135 --> 00:33:07,736
What is that?

865
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:09,165
Did they say that twice?

866
00:33:10,006 --> 00:33:11,036
(Embarrassed)

867
00:33:11,336 --> 00:33:12,336
(Sighing)

868
00:33:12,336 --> 00:33:13,806
I didn't catch what they said.

869
00:33:15,046 --> 00:33:16,476
What a mass.

870
00:33:16,476 --> 00:33:17,675
We said we'll turn everything black.

871
00:33:17,675 --> 00:33:21,615
Oh, "we'll turn everything black."

872
00:33:21,615 --> 00:33:23,286
Okay. I see.

873
00:33:24,716 --> 00:33:26,016
You'll get 200 max.

874
00:33:26,685 --> 00:33:28,326
I expect 100.

875
00:33:28,326 --> 00:33:29,685
- It's humiliating. - I expect 100.

876
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:32,125
Let's see the score. Here we go.

877
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:33,125
One...

878
00:33:41,105 --> 00:33:42,135
Oh, my goodness.

879
00:33:43,135 --> 00:33:44,375
- Good luck. - You went down on your knees?

880
00:33:46,175 --> 00:33:49,546
(As a failed team leader...)

881
00:33:49,546 --> 00:33:50,845
Goodness.

882
00:33:50,845 --> 00:33:52,145
(She lays her pride as a model aside.)

883
00:33:52,145 --> 00:33:53,675
My goodness, Hye Jin.

884
00:33:55,016 --> 00:33:56,915
(Victory isn't important.)

885
00:33:56,915 --> 00:34:00,016
It's nothing more or less than getting to know each other.

886
00:34:01,026 --> 00:34:05,055
It's making me cry. I can't watch this.

887
00:34:06,196 --> 00:34:08,725
They're all going down on their knees.

888
00:34:08,725 --> 00:34:10,196
It's all turning black.

889
00:34:10,196 --> 00:34:12,395
1, 2, 3.

890
00:34:14,805 --> 00:34:16,966
(150, 100, 100)

891
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,535
- 350. - They're cold.

892
00:34:19,535 --> 00:34:20,875
She lost.

893
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:22,276
(Team Yi wins.)

894
00:34:22,805 --> 00:34:25,216
(This is why you cheer.)

895
00:34:25,745 --> 00:34:27,075
(Sad)

896
00:34:27,745 --> 00:34:29,716
Come on. It's fine.

897
00:34:30,086 --> 00:34:31,555
I was wrong.

898
00:34:31,915 --> 00:34:33,716
That's what Hyun Yi's good at.

899
00:34:33,986 --> 00:34:36,225
She can come up with an idea on the spot.

900
00:34:36,455 --> 00:34:37,796
- Doing something on the spot. - Are you sure you're not bad?

901
00:34:37,796 --> 00:34:39,895
- I was going to say that. - I don't have that skill.

902
00:34:39,895 --> 00:34:42,366
When I saw them lining up,

903
00:34:42,366 --> 00:34:44,765
I knew I was going to win.

904
00:34:44,935 --> 00:34:47,305
You must stay together to cheer.

905
00:34:47,305 --> 00:34:48,366
I see.

906
00:34:48,366 --> 00:34:49,836
- Right. - To be loud.

907
00:34:49,836 --> 00:34:51,375
- She's right. - So...

908
00:34:51,435 --> 00:34:54,745
I knew their formation was wrong.

909
00:34:55,446 --> 00:34:59,415
Let's start the game now.

910
00:34:59,645 --> 00:35:01,915
Please line up.

911
00:35:01,915 --> 00:35:04,086
- They're all standing. - Yes.

912
00:35:04,455 --> 00:35:05,886
No one's squatting.

913
00:35:05,886 --> 00:35:07,725
I don't see anyone.

914
00:35:07,725 --> 00:35:09,526
- I always squat down. - Really?

915
00:35:09,685 --> 00:35:12,355
I always do this, but they're all standing.

916
00:35:12,355 --> 00:35:14,026
It's normal for us.

917
00:35:14,026 --> 00:35:16,825
We always lean on one foot.

918
00:35:16,825 --> 00:35:17,995
Or we go like this.

919
00:35:17,995 --> 00:35:19,165
- As if you're posing. - Yes.

920
00:35:19,165 --> 00:35:20,636
When you come to comedians' sports festival,

921
00:35:20,636 --> 00:35:22,265
Jung Ryul stands like this.

922
00:35:22,836 --> 00:35:24,375
When's it going to be over?

923
00:35:25,305 --> 00:35:27,975
- How about Joon Ho? - He's already lying down.

924
00:35:27,975 --> 00:35:29,245
- Lying down? - He lies down.

925
00:35:29,245 --> 00:35:30,846
He drinks rice wine as soon as he comes.

926
00:35:31,515 --> 00:35:33,986
It's crazy. No one stands like that.

927
00:35:35,785 --> 00:35:37,515
It's Up and Down game.

928
00:35:38,316 --> 00:35:40,185
- Have you ever played it before? - What?

929
00:35:41,355 --> 00:35:43,586
- What is it? - It's so long.

930
00:35:43,586 --> 00:35:44,756
Does that require running?

931
00:35:44,756 --> 00:35:46,455
Flip it over your head.

932
00:35:46,455 --> 00:35:48,926
- Do you roll that stick? - Over your head from toe.

933
00:35:48,926 --> 00:35:50,426
It's like a group skipping rope.

934
00:35:50,836 --> 00:35:52,535
Hey. Cross your arms.

935
00:35:52,535 --> 00:35:54,205
Or your can hold hands.

936
00:35:54,205 --> 00:35:56,265
We'll begin soon.

937
00:35:56,705 --> 00:35:57,805
Get ready.

938
00:35:58,035 --> 00:36:00,176
Safety is most important.

939
00:36:00,176 --> 00:36:02,245
- Be careful. - Don't trip.

940
00:36:02,245 --> 00:36:03,605
Set,

941
00:36:03,605 --> 00:36:05,346
- I was so nervous. - go.

942
00:36:05,346 --> 00:36:06,446
Cheer, Team Yi.

943
00:36:06,446 --> 00:36:08,015
- 1, 2, 3. - We can do it.

944
00:36:08,015 --> 00:36:09,486
Cheer, Team Han. 1, 2, 3.

945
00:36:09,486 --> 00:36:11,256
- We can do it. - Get ready.

946
00:36:12,586 --> 00:36:13,955
(The game starts.)

947
00:36:13,955 --> 00:36:15,055
- Be careful. - There it goes.

948
00:36:15,055 --> 00:36:16,586
(Team Hye Jin outruns.)

949
00:36:16,586 --> 00:36:17,895
You're doing great.

950
00:36:17,895 --> 00:36:19,426
(What?)

951
00:36:20,495 --> 00:36:21,765
They tripped.

952
00:36:22,026 --> 00:36:24,696
They trip because of their long legs.

953
00:36:24,696 --> 00:36:25,765
Be careful.

954
00:36:25,765 --> 00:36:26,765
(It's all right.)

955
00:36:27,665 --> 00:36:29,935
(The gap is noticeably big.)

956
00:36:30,636 --> 00:36:32,906
Faster. My goodness.

957
00:36:33,176 --> 00:36:35,305
It's because they're tall.

958
00:36:35,305 --> 00:36:37,946
- It's because they're tall. - Faster.

959
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,316
(They're catching up.)

960
00:36:39,915 --> 00:36:42,285
It looks nice with all the models playing.

961
00:36:42,716 --> 00:36:44,055
They're tall.

962
00:36:44,616 --> 00:36:46,355
They're tall, but slow.

963
00:36:46,355 --> 00:36:47,685
Faster.

964
00:36:47,685 --> 00:36:50,486
Last round.

965
00:36:50,486 --> 00:36:52,096
(The gap has narrowed.)

966
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:54,066
Team Yi is coming.

967
00:36:54,066 --> 00:36:56,995
- Which team would win? - Hurry up.

968
00:36:56,995 --> 00:36:58,736
Who's the winner?

969
00:36:58,736 --> 00:37:00,296
(Team Han chases.)

970
00:37:00,296 --> 00:37:02,765
- Hurry up. - Who's the winner?

971
00:37:02,765 --> 00:37:03,975
And?

972
00:37:03,975 --> 00:37:06,105
(Will they win the breathtaking chase?)

973
00:37:08,487 --> 00:37:10,826
- Hurry up. - Who's the winner?

974
00:37:10,826 --> 00:37:12,226
And?

975
00:37:12,226 --> 00:37:14,127
(Who's the winner of this unpredictable game?)

976
00:37:14,127 --> 00:37:15,197
And?

977
00:37:16,127 --> 00:37:17,866
(It arrives first by a head.)

978
00:37:21,936 --> 00:37:23,536
Good job.

979
00:37:23,536 --> 00:37:25,237
- Good job. - Team Yi wins.

980
00:37:25,237 --> 00:37:27,036
They won twice in a row.

981
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,206
(We won!)

982
00:37:30,746 --> 00:37:33,547
Hold on. The game's not over yet.

983
00:37:34,717 --> 00:37:36,487
- We don't have much time left. - Yoon Ju is so excited.

984
00:37:37,556 --> 00:37:39,357
She's way too excited.

985
00:37:39,686 --> 00:37:41,527
She's relieving all her stress from babysitting.

986
00:37:41,527 --> 00:37:43,357
- She's overly excited. - Applause please.

987
00:37:44,197 --> 00:37:46,357
(Applause to both teams for their effort)

988
00:37:46,427 --> 00:37:47,797
(I'll win this time.)

989
00:37:47,866 --> 00:37:50,697
- From now on, it'll go up. - What is it this time?

990
00:37:50,697 --> 00:37:52,936
We'll measure the time it takes to pass this.

991
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:54,436
You'll have to crawl.

992
00:37:54,436 --> 00:37:55,936
- Please sit down. - You have to crawl.

993
00:37:55,936 --> 00:37:58,137
I'm really good at crawling.

994
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:01,706
Team Yi who's winning by 51 points...

995
00:38:01,706 --> 00:38:03,907
will play first.

996
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:06,777
Whoever believes he served the most difficult time...

997
00:38:06,777 --> 00:38:08,246
in the army, please come out.

998
00:38:08,616 --> 00:38:10,717
- The Marine Corps. Yes. - The army.

999
00:38:11,157 --> 00:38:12,456
He said he's not.

1000
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:13,616
(Kim Do Jin wasn't in the Marine Corps.)

1001
00:38:13,616 --> 00:38:14,887
He wasn't in the Marine Corps.

1002
00:38:15,357 --> 00:38:16,427
Victory.

1003
00:38:16,726 --> 00:38:18,197
- Salute. - I see.

1004
00:38:19,826 --> 00:38:21,766
- You have to crawl. Can you? - Get ready.

1005
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:24,297
Lie on your stomach.

1006
00:38:24,297 --> 00:38:26,067
(He's ready to crawl.)

1007
00:38:26,737 --> 00:38:28,306
No. Don't.

1008
00:38:28,967 --> 00:38:31,407
(Battle mode)

1009
00:38:32,177 --> 00:38:37,206
(As soon as the starting signal rings...)

1010
00:38:37,947 --> 00:38:40,576
He was really fast.

1011
00:38:40,576 --> 00:38:41,717
(Marching mode)

1012
00:38:42,217 --> 00:38:45,487
(Strong friend, Korea's army)

1013
00:38:46,817 --> 00:38:48,226
Good job, army.

1014
00:38:48,286 --> 00:38:50,487
Ministry of National Defense can use this as an ad.

1015
00:38:51,257 --> 00:38:52,427
Come to the very end.

1016
00:38:52,427 --> 00:38:53,496
He's good.

1017
00:38:53,496 --> 00:38:55,027
(He instantly passes the finish line.)

1018
00:38:55,027 --> 00:38:56,396
He's very fast.

1019
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:58,596
Communication security.

1020
00:38:58,596 --> 00:39:01,067
He's good. He's good.

1021
00:39:01,607 --> 00:39:03,067
Their record is...

1022
00:39:03,067 --> 00:39:04,277
Everything is in order, sir.

1023
00:39:04,277 --> 00:39:07,576
Their record is 5.95 seconds.

1024
00:39:08,047 --> 00:39:09,306
- 5 seconds? - How can he be so fast?

1025
00:39:09,306 --> 00:39:11,047
- He's too fast. - He's really fast.

1026
00:39:11,047 --> 00:39:14,587
Next person is a former marine...

1027
00:39:14,587 --> 00:39:15,817
from Team Han.

1028
00:39:15,947 --> 00:39:17,757
- Is he a former marine? - He's from Marine Corps.

1029
00:39:18,317 --> 00:39:19,916
Tei.

1030
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:21,786
- Come on, Lee Jae Soo. - He's a real marine.

1031
00:39:22,757 --> 00:39:24,357
(Tei, also known as Lee Jae Soo)

1032
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:28,726
(He's the one who previously suffered from eating wasabi.)

1033
00:39:29,197 --> 00:39:30,297
Here we go.

1034
00:39:30,496 --> 00:39:31,866
- The former marine. - Go, Tei!

1035
00:39:32,567 --> 00:39:33,666
He's all bent.

1036
00:39:33,666 --> 00:39:34,936
- He's bent. - He's a former marine.

1037
00:39:34,936 --> 00:39:36,967
- He's a former marine. - He will finish in five seconds.

1038
00:39:36,967 --> 00:39:39,337
- Ready. - Let's go!

1039
00:39:39,706 --> 00:39:40,706
(Go.)

1040
00:39:41,476 --> 00:39:42,877
(He moves awkwardly.)

1041
00:39:42,877 --> 00:39:43,947
He's long.

1042
00:39:44,377 --> 00:39:46,317
He's long. He's long.

1043
00:39:46,746 --> 00:39:48,547
He's long. He's long.

1044
00:39:49,717 --> 00:39:51,516
(Using his long body,)

1045
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,127
(he finished in two leaps.)

1046
00:39:55,887 --> 00:39:57,456
(Striding)

1047
00:39:57,456 --> 00:39:58,697
That's it.

1048
00:39:58,826 --> 00:40:00,866
- He's really long. - Isn't he really fast?

1049
00:40:01,067 --> 00:40:03,467
- Isn't he like a centipede? - He's a little scary.

1050
00:40:04,766 --> 00:40:08,967
(The former marine is possessed by the spirit of a centipede.)

1051
00:40:09,467 --> 00:40:10,467
(What's his record?)

1052
00:40:10,467 --> 00:40:11,607
How many seconds did he take?

1053
00:40:11,607 --> 00:40:12,837
- Five seconds and... - Okay.

1054
00:40:12,837 --> 00:40:15,646
(5 seconds and...)

1055
00:40:16,646 --> 00:40:18,976
(The aggressive former soldier got the record of 5.95 seconds.)

1056
00:40:20,246 --> 00:40:21,346
Five seconds and...

1057
00:40:21,947 --> 00:40:23,786
11.

1058
00:40:23,916 --> 00:40:25,317
- He's fast. - Team Han won once.

1059
00:40:25,317 --> 00:40:27,387
They won.

1060
00:40:28,956 --> 00:40:30,087
(They won for the first time.)

1061
00:40:30,487 --> 00:40:31,556
(Thanks to the former soldiers, the atmosphere is heated up.)

1062
00:40:31,556 --> 00:40:32,657
He was good.

1063
00:40:32,857 --> 00:40:34,067
All right, now.

1064
00:40:35,797 --> 00:40:36,927
What's going on?

1065
00:40:36,927 --> 00:40:38,697
- It's hailing. - What's going on?

1066
00:40:39,266 --> 00:40:42,806
(Suddenly strong wind blows.)

1067
00:40:43,237 --> 00:40:45,137
Be careful.

1068
00:40:45,137 --> 00:40:47,907
(Even the MC is flustered.)

1069
00:40:48,407 --> 00:40:50,407
- What's going on? - Is it raining?

1070
00:40:50,947 --> 00:40:53,277
Why did that happen so suddenly?

1071
00:40:55,047 --> 00:40:56,616
What do we do?

1072
00:40:56,616 --> 00:40:58,286
(The strong wind unexpectedly hit them.)

1073
00:40:58,286 --> 00:40:59,317
- No way. - My goodness.

1074
00:40:59,616 --> 00:41:00,726
Even the sky is...

1075
00:41:01,686 --> 00:41:04,326
(It's like everything is going to be blown away.)

1076
00:41:04,627 --> 00:41:07,697
(A strong wind warning was issued all over the country that day.)

1077
00:41:08,596 --> 00:41:09,726
- Right. - So that was the day.

1078
00:41:09,726 --> 00:41:11,337
That day a truck fell because of the wind.

1079
00:41:11,396 --> 00:41:13,936
- Signage flew too. - Right.

1080
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:17,067
(The weather is so nice.)

1081
00:41:18,377 --> 00:41:20,576
(The weather couldn't be better.)

1082
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:23,576
- Why are they taking down the tent? - It's dangerous.

1083
00:41:23,576 --> 00:41:24,677
It's dangerous.

1084
00:41:25,677 --> 00:41:26,877
(It's an emergency situation.)

1085
00:41:26,877 --> 00:41:28,146
It happened really suddenly, didn't it?

1086
00:41:28,487 --> 00:41:29,887
Suddenly there was a strong wind.

1087
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:32,857
An unbelievable thing happened before my eyes.

1088
00:41:34,757 --> 00:41:37,896
It was a natural disaster.

1089
00:41:38,527 --> 00:41:40,896
It was. It was a natural disaster.

1090
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,766
Why is the wind blowing so hard?

1091
00:41:43,967 --> 00:41:46,896
Everyone's here for Hye Jin.

1092
00:41:46,896 --> 00:41:50,166
And she must've been really bad to the crew.

1093
00:41:50,166 --> 00:41:52,476
That's why the wind is not helping her.

1094
00:41:53,237 --> 00:41:56,377
I realized it once again.

1095
00:41:57,146 --> 00:41:58,317
Even now...

1096
00:41:58,317 --> 00:41:59,476
My goodness.

1097
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:00,846
It turns out I was causing the wind.

1098
00:42:02,616 --> 00:42:03,987
It wasn't Hye Jin.

1099
00:42:04,516 --> 00:42:05,857
Yoon Ju was so excited.

1100
00:42:05,857 --> 00:42:07,427
- Hye Jin's rage brought the wind. - It's because of Yoon Ju's feet.

1101
00:42:07,427 --> 00:42:09,587
That's what brought the wind.

1102
00:42:10,387 --> 00:42:12,326
(Whoever caused it,)

1103
00:42:12,326 --> 00:42:14,427
(the wind is very strong today.)

1104
00:42:15,596 --> 00:42:17,737
(She joined the sports day with resolute determination.)

1105
00:42:18,237 --> 00:42:19,496
They only played two games, didn't they?

1106
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:21,407
Those were just opening games too.

1107
00:42:21,407 --> 00:42:23,306
(We just started. We can't stop here.)

1108
00:42:23,637 --> 00:42:27,206
Guys. Right now,

1109
00:42:27,206 --> 00:42:29,806
the situation is bad.

1110
00:42:29,976 --> 00:42:33,076
The weather condition is really bad.

1111
00:42:33,377 --> 00:42:36,246
We are going to play just two more games.

1112
00:42:36,246 --> 00:42:39,686
We will play tug-of-war and relay race.

1113
00:42:40,116 --> 00:42:41,387
Relay race is the highlight.

1114
00:42:41,757 --> 00:42:44,496
Then we will go to a bar...

1115
00:42:44,927 --> 00:42:46,757
and damage...

1116
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:48,927
our fresh liver.

1117
00:42:49,766 --> 00:42:52,166
(Dhalsim boosts everyone's morale.)

1118
00:42:52,166 --> 00:42:54,806
Is Hye Jin buying the drinks?

1119
00:42:55,007 --> 00:42:56,837
Is Hye Jin buying the drinks?

1120
00:42:57,476 --> 00:43:00,436
(The eldest model asks a sharp question.)

1121
00:43:01,646 --> 00:43:03,206
(What?)

1122
00:43:03,777 --> 00:43:08,116
(Everyone waits for her to say yes.)

1123
00:43:09,447 --> 00:43:12,016
- There are so many people. - Yoon Ju is nasty.

1124
00:43:12,016 --> 00:43:14,326
Yoon Ju is nasty.

1125
00:43:14,326 --> 00:43:15,927
My gosh. She's cruel.

1126
00:43:16,286 --> 00:43:17,996
Wait.

1127
00:43:17,996 --> 00:43:19,527
- Hyun Moo's busted. - Wait.

1128
00:43:19,697 --> 00:43:21,967
Wait. Hye Jin would be the one treating them.

1129
00:43:21,967 --> 00:43:23,527
Why would you hate Yoon Ju?

1130
00:43:23,996 --> 00:43:25,096
What?

1131
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:26,766
(Right.)

1132
00:43:28,967 --> 00:43:30,907
I accidentally sympathized with her.

1133
00:43:31,877 --> 00:43:33,007
I should remain neutral.

1134
00:43:34,206 --> 00:43:38,516
(Dalshim is standing at the crossroads.)

1135
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:41,047
(While she's hesitating,)

1136
00:43:41,047 --> 00:43:42,186
Thank you, Hye Jin!

1137
00:43:43,186 --> 00:43:45,387
(they thank her first.)

1138
00:43:47,116 --> 00:43:49,127
Thank you. Thank you.

1139
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,927
(Leadership...)

1140
00:43:51,927 --> 00:43:55,266
(comes from your wallet.)

1141
00:43:55,797 --> 00:43:58,567
(Money made her leadership more solid.)

1142
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:01,907
- That's good. - By the way, when that happens,

1143
00:44:01,907 --> 00:44:03,206
even if Hye Jin pays,

1144
00:44:03,206 --> 00:44:06,007
- they will thank Yoon Ju. - Right.

1145
00:44:07,806 --> 00:44:10,007
I will pay.

1146
00:44:10,646 --> 00:44:12,277
Thank you, Yoon Ju.

1147
00:44:12,777 --> 00:44:14,786
- Thank you. - It's as if she's paying.

1148
00:44:15,116 --> 00:44:18,717
Let's cheer up a little...

1149
00:44:19,186 --> 00:44:20,556
and get it done.

1150
00:44:20,556 --> 00:44:21,826
(Dalshim successfully boosts their morale.)

1151
00:44:24,027 --> 00:44:25,127
Okay.

1152
00:44:25,127 --> 00:44:27,666
(And the great tug-of-war begins.)

1153
00:44:27,797 --> 00:44:29,826
Stand.

1154
00:44:30,067 --> 00:44:32,467
- I hope she will at least win. - Of course.

1155
00:44:32,467 --> 00:44:33,666
I know.

1156
00:44:33,666 --> 00:44:36,607
Come forward. Stay closer.

1157
00:44:37,507 --> 00:44:39,436
Stand with your feet wide apart.

1158
00:44:39,576 --> 00:44:40,637
Ready.

1159
00:44:41,377 --> 00:44:43,206
I love this. I love this.

1160
00:44:43,206 --> 00:44:44,746
(The game begins with much excitement.)

1161
00:44:44,746 --> 00:44:46,317
- You have to lie down. - Just lie down.

1162
00:44:46,317 --> 00:44:47,516
They're good.

1163
00:44:48,246 --> 00:44:50,186
1, 2.

1164
00:44:51,116 --> 00:44:52,286
- What's going on? - You have to lie down.

1165
00:44:53,116 --> 00:44:54,357
Why are they so bad?

1166
00:44:54,357 --> 00:44:55,987
(Team Han is falling apart.)

1167
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:01,396
(They get dragged.)

1168
00:45:02,127 --> 00:45:04,666
(It's a mess.)

1169
00:45:04,666 --> 00:45:06,197
Team Yi wins!

1170
00:45:06,197 --> 00:45:08,766
(Team Han lost the balance and crashed.)

1171
00:45:08,766 --> 00:45:10,806
Please be careful.

1172
00:45:10,806 --> 00:45:12,877
Don't get hurt.

1173
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:15,806
Attention. Attention.

1174
00:45:15,806 --> 00:45:16,907
(Li Sa's mom is the most excited one.)

1175
00:45:17,646 --> 00:45:20,217
It's too windy. Let's hurry and get it done. Attention.

1176
00:45:20,476 --> 00:45:23,286
Here's why we lost.

1177
00:45:23,286 --> 00:45:26,556
I thought the force had to be in the front to pull well.

1178
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:30,056
- I told everyone to move forward. - Lee Su Geun taught me this.

1179
00:45:30,056 --> 00:45:31,956
To win the tug-of-war,

1180
00:45:32,496 --> 00:45:34,427
you have to lie down as soon as the judge blows the whistle.

1181
00:45:34,427 --> 00:45:37,326
You have to really stretch your arm to hold the rope.

1182
00:45:37,326 --> 00:45:38,396
Then you have to lie down like this.

1183
00:45:38,396 --> 00:45:39,936
I didn't know.

1184
00:45:39,936 --> 00:45:42,007
I told everyone to come forward.

1185
00:45:42,007 --> 00:45:44,237
That's why all the people in the front fell.

1186
00:45:44,306 --> 00:45:45,576
Everyone fell.

1187
00:45:45,777 --> 00:45:47,337
You have to lie down.

1188
00:45:47,337 --> 00:45:49,806
It's important to choose the right leader.

1189
00:45:51,346 --> 00:45:53,076
(He carelessly criticizes Hye Jin.)

1190
00:45:53,076 --> 00:45:54,817
He said a harsh criticism.

1191
00:45:55,447 --> 00:45:57,217
- Please move to the right. - We have to spread out a little.

1192
00:45:57,217 --> 00:45:59,157
We have to spread out. I am sorry.

1193
00:45:59,157 --> 00:46:01,186
- We have to spread out. - Let's switch the sides.

1194
00:46:01,186 --> 00:46:02,956
Go forward.

1195
00:46:03,887 --> 00:46:08,496
(They change the side to the background music.)

1196
00:46:08,697 --> 00:46:09,967
Ready and sit down.

1197
00:46:10,866 --> 00:46:12,096
Ready.

1198
00:46:12,096 --> 00:46:13,766
- We should just lie down. - Right.

1199
00:46:14,536 --> 00:46:16,366
Just lie down. Will you do it right?

1200
00:46:16,366 --> 00:46:18,737
See? She's lying down.

1201
00:46:19,536 --> 00:46:20,607
Ready.

1202
00:46:21,277 --> 00:46:22,377
Do it well.

1203
00:46:23,076 --> 00:46:24,947
That was really fun.

1204
00:46:27,317 --> 00:46:28,717
- You have to lie down. - You should lie down.

1205
00:46:28,717 --> 00:46:29,987
(Everyone cheers for Team Han.)

1206
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:31,317
- Lie down. - Lie down.

1207
00:46:31,317 --> 00:46:32,387
Lie down.

1208
00:46:32,887 --> 00:46:35,226
(Please do well.)

1209
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:38,297
(As soon as the whistle is blown,)

1210
00:46:38,956 --> 00:46:40,056
You have to lie down.

1211
00:46:40,056 --> 00:46:42,027
(she frowns and tries hard to lie down.)

1212
00:46:42,326 --> 00:46:43,467
She...

1213
00:46:43,697 --> 00:46:44,896
You shouldn't do that. You just have to lie down.

1214
00:46:44,896 --> 00:46:46,496
(Laughing)

1215
00:46:47,666 --> 00:46:49,907
She didn't care about her image at all.

1216
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:51,177
(Winning is all she cared about.)

1217
00:46:51,436 --> 00:46:53,076
She didn't care about her image at all.

1218
00:46:54,246 --> 00:46:57,306
(Wanting to win, she desperately pulls the rope.)

1219
00:46:57,516 --> 00:46:59,016
She really didn't want to lose.

1220
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:00,346
That's...

1221
00:47:00,547 --> 00:47:02,217
That's how a novice plays the tug-of-war.

1222
00:47:02,416 --> 00:47:03,547
My gosh. She is...

1223
00:47:03,547 --> 00:47:05,786
(Hye Jin, I won't cut you slack. You know that, right?)

1224
00:47:07,016 --> 00:47:10,127
(Burning with desire to win, she seems merciless.)

1225
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:15,166
- They won. They won. - They won!

1226
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:16,996
- They won. - They won.

1227
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:20,907
Team Han wins!

1228
00:47:21,637 --> 00:47:24,806
(Dalshim seems relieved.)

1229
00:47:25,377 --> 00:47:28,107
- It's 1 on 1 now. - It was so fun.

1230
00:47:28,107 --> 00:47:29,646
The leaders will play rock-paper-scissors...

1231
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:32,416
and choose the side first.

1232
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:33,976
Where you play is important.

1233
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,286
- I wanted to stay where we won. - What side?

1234
00:47:35,516 --> 00:47:36,817
You have to choose one of two sides.

1235
00:47:36,817 --> 00:47:39,887
I felt stronger when I was pulling from that side.

1236
00:47:41,556 --> 00:47:43,786
- Come on. - Come on.

1237
00:47:43,786 --> 00:47:46,056
We don't have time. Let's hurry up.

1238
00:47:46,127 --> 00:47:47,467
Ready.

1239
00:47:47,467 --> 00:47:51,837
(Let's take it slow. I am too excited.)

1240
00:47:53,266 --> 00:47:54,837
She drank makgeolli, didn't she?

1241
00:47:54,837 --> 00:47:58,137
- Honestly, did she drink or not? - She didn't drink.

1242
00:47:58,137 --> 00:48:00,907
- She must've been drunk. - She needs to be tested.

1243
00:48:00,976 --> 00:48:02,047
(He learns the dance.)

1244
00:48:04,177 --> 00:48:05,277
Look at her.

1245
00:48:05,277 --> 00:48:07,146
- Why is she doing that? - This arm comes first.

1246
00:48:07,146 --> 00:48:08,616
(She gets to relieve all the stress she got from raising a child.)

1247
00:48:09,416 --> 00:48:10,857
What kind of a dance is that?

1248
00:48:11,887 --> 00:48:13,116
Ready.

1249
00:48:13,116 --> 00:48:14,257
Come on, Yoon Ju.

1250
00:48:15,286 --> 00:48:17,056
- Here we go. - Hey.

1251
00:48:17,056 --> 00:48:18,927
The one who wins...

1252
00:48:18,927 --> 00:48:20,357
What will you give?

1253
00:48:20,427 --> 00:48:22,197
You get to...

1254
00:48:22,197 --> 00:48:23,797
There's always someone like her.

1255
00:48:25,096 --> 00:48:26,536
Dalshim can't do anything.

1256
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:28,036
I know. It's our first time to see her like that.

1257
00:48:28,666 --> 00:48:30,467
- You don't have to turn back. - I won't see it.

1258
00:48:30,467 --> 00:48:31,936
Will you play like that?

1259
00:48:31,936 --> 00:48:33,476
Please!

1260
00:48:33,476 --> 00:48:35,806
You can just look at her and play.

1261
00:48:35,806 --> 00:48:38,317
Please!

1262
00:48:38,317 --> 00:48:40,377
You lose if you don't play. Rock, paper, scissors.

1263
00:48:40,786 --> 00:48:41,887
Rock, paper, scissors.

1264
00:48:41,887 --> 00:48:43,616
- Hey! - If you... We don't have time.

1265
00:48:43,616 --> 00:48:44,817
- Rock, paper, scissors. - Rock, paper, scissors.

1266
00:48:44,817 --> 00:48:46,416
They're going to grab each other by the collar soon.

1267
00:48:46,956 --> 00:48:48,157
They are going to grab each other soon.

1268
00:48:48,257 --> 00:48:50,186
Rock, paper, scissors.

1269
00:48:50,186 --> 00:48:52,357
(Yoon Ju wins.)

1270
00:48:52,357 --> 00:48:54,326
I am really bad at rock, paper, scissors.

1271
00:48:54,366 --> 00:48:55,896
- Which side would you like? - That side!

1272
00:48:55,896 --> 00:48:58,067
All right!

1273
00:48:58,637 --> 00:49:02,436
(Lisa, mommy won.)

1274
00:49:04,536 --> 00:49:05,806
Hye Jin!

1275
00:49:05,806 --> 00:49:07,277
(Team Han loses a good spot.)

1276
00:49:08,107 --> 00:49:10,507
The wind is blowing left to right.

1277
00:49:10,607 --> 00:49:12,246
The wind will hit their faces.

1278
00:49:12,246 --> 00:49:14,016
- They are at a disadvantage. - We can do it!!

1279
00:49:14,116 --> 00:49:15,317
We can do it!

1280
00:49:15,686 --> 00:49:19,616
(Strong wind blows once again.)

1281
00:49:20,587 --> 00:49:21,786
That's right.

1282
00:49:22,956 --> 00:49:26,027
(Team Han grabs the rope with their eyes closed.)

1283
00:49:27,427 --> 00:49:29,326
They are at a disadvantage.

1284
00:49:29,567 --> 00:49:30,967
Work together.

1285
00:49:31,197 --> 00:49:32,866
I hope they win.

1286
00:49:33,436 --> 00:49:36,536
They are like yellow croakers that are roped together.

1287
00:49:36,536 --> 00:49:37,777
That's a good tactic.

1288
00:49:38,237 --> 00:49:39,536
(The 3rd round)

1289
00:49:39,536 --> 00:49:40,846
(It begins.)

1290
00:49:40,846 --> 00:49:41,976
That's good.

1291
00:49:44,916 --> 00:49:47,817
(You can imagine her expression from the sound she is making.)

1292
00:49:48,047 --> 00:49:49,447
Come on.

1293
00:49:49,447 --> 00:49:53,016
(Imagining her expression makes her laugh.)

1294
00:49:53,016 --> 00:49:56,286
(Kian84 is absorbed.)

1295
00:49:58,857 --> 00:50:01,996
I bet my life on the round.

1296
00:50:01,996 --> 00:50:03,326
Pull! Pull!

1297
00:50:05,197 --> 00:50:07,436
(They are ready to lie down.)

1298
00:50:07,436 --> 00:50:08,536
Heave-ho!

1299
00:50:08,536 --> 00:50:10,666
- It's working. - It's working.

1300
00:50:10,706 --> 00:50:12,476
The other team is getting pulled.

1301
00:50:13,737 --> 00:50:15,947
- It's working. - It's working.

1302
00:50:18,277 --> 00:50:20,047
Team Han won!

1303
00:50:22,516 --> 00:50:25,257
(She is so excited that she dances.)

1304
00:50:25,257 --> 00:50:26,416
This is embarrassing.

1305
00:50:30,357 --> 00:50:33,157
(The mood is festive.)

1306
00:50:34,797 --> 00:50:38,137
(Dhalsim is overjoyed.)

1307
00:50:38,137 --> 00:50:39,396
This is embarrassing.

1308
00:50:40,436 --> 00:50:41,637
(Team Yi is devastated.)

1309
00:50:41,637 --> 00:50:43,766
Please gather around in the middle.

1310
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:44,976
Now...

1311
00:50:44,976 --> 00:50:47,277
(Amidst them,)

1312
00:50:47,907 --> 00:50:50,206
(Lisa's mom is excited even though she has lost.)

1313
00:50:50,206 --> 00:50:53,317
- Why is she excited? - What is wrong with her?

1314
00:50:53,947 --> 00:50:56,916
(They don't understand her.)

1315
00:50:57,616 --> 00:50:59,487
What is wrong with her?

1316
00:50:59,487 --> 00:51:01,357
It doesn't matter whether she wins or loses.

1317
00:51:01,357 --> 00:51:03,987
You should take her to a club.

1318
00:51:04,896 --> 00:51:06,657
Now,

1319
00:51:06,657 --> 00:51:09,226
- the last match remains. - It's exhausting to clap.

1320
00:51:09,226 --> 00:51:10,527
It's a relay.

1321
00:51:10,866 --> 00:51:12,936
- Relay is the most important. - Please pick...

1322
00:51:12,936 --> 00:51:14,507
the runners.

1323
00:51:14,507 --> 00:51:15,567
Can you run fast?

1324
00:51:15,567 --> 00:51:17,337
Isn't Hyun Yi a good runner?

1325
00:51:17,337 --> 00:51:19,007
This is how I run.

1326
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:20,206
It seems like...

1327
00:51:21,447 --> 00:51:25,377
my feet push the ground like...

1328
00:51:25,947 --> 00:51:31,956
(Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap)

1329
00:51:32,387 --> 00:51:33,616
What?

1330
00:51:33,616 --> 00:51:36,326
- Are you drunk? - What was that?

1331
00:51:36,357 --> 00:51:38,197
It seems like...

1332
00:51:38,496 --> 00:51:39,657
You seem like a stranger today.

1333
00:51:40,257 --> 00:51:42,396
- What is wrong with her? - You seem like a stranger today.

1334
00:51:42,396 --> 00:51:43,666
When I run...

1335
00:51:43,666 --> 00:51:45,237
- What is wrong with her? - She became a fool.

1336
00:51:45,237 --> 00:51:46,567
Why did she take off her shoes?

1337
00:51:46,996 --> 00:51:49,666
What is wrong with Yoon Ju and you?

1338
00:51:50,737 --> 00:51:52,407
- This is how I run. - Show us.

1339
00:51:52,407 --> 00:51:54,346
(Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap)

1340
00:51:54,346 --> 00:51:55,877
- What was that? - Must you hold your hands that way?

1341
00:51:56,047 --> 00:51:57,246
(Her hands don't move.)

1342
00:51:57,246 --> 00:51:59,346
- What was that? - Must you hold your hands that way?

1343
00:51:59,346 --> 00:52:00,447
What was that?

1344
00:52:00,547 --> 00:52:02,916
- Let's do a doping test. - What is wrong with her?

1345
00:52:02,916 --> 00:52:05,157
- What is wrong with you? - What is wrong with her?

1346
00:52:05,157 --> 00:52:07,016
(Everyone comments on the way she held her hands.)

1347
00:52:07,016 --> 00:52:09,257
- Why did you hands go like this? - I hit the ground hard...

1348
00:52:09,257 --> 00:52:11,326
when I run.

1349
00:52:11,326 --> 00:52:13,127
I run very fast.

1350
00:52:13,127 --> 00:52:15,027
- You run with short strides. - Yes.

1351
00:52:15,027 --> 00:52:17,366
- I run very fast. - I see.

1352
00:52:17,866 --> 00:52:19,896
Why do your hands go like this?

1353
00:52:19,896 --> 00:52:21,206
Why?

1354
00:52:21,737 --> 00:52:25,237
(They ask her again.)

1355
00:52:25,237 --> 00:52:26,706
She is like tyrannosaurus.

1356
00:52:26,837 --> 00:52:28,107
It's not like that.

1357
00:52:28,607 --> 00:52:30,306
(She puts her hands together as if she is pushing a cart.)

1358
00:52:30,306 --> 00:52:32,547
She turned strange.

1359
00:52:32,547 --> 00:52:34,116
You are stranger than Yoon Ju's dance.

1360
00:52:34,416 --> 00:52:36,186
- You are stranger than her dance. - What is up with her?

1361
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:38,357
- What is up with your hands? - She runs with short strides.

1362
00:52:38,357 --> 00:52:43,686
- What is up with your hands? - I am very fast.

1363
00:52:44,726 --> 00:52:45,956
(I am fast.)

1364
00:52:45,956 --> 00:52:47,896
We understood.

1365
00:52:47,896 --> 00:52:50,027
That's how fast my feet move.

1366
00:52:50,027 --> 00:52:52,197
- Your feet almost go invisible. - That's right.

1367
00:52:52,197 --> 00:52:54,467
- Why didn't you say that? - Do they almost go invisible?

1368
00:52:54,467 --> 00:52:57,407
Tell me what is up with your hands!

1369
00:52:57,407 --> 00:52:59,677
People with stiff bodies put their hands like this.

1370
00:53:00,007 --> 00:53:01,746
They move with my legs.

1371
00:53:02,277 --> 00:53:03,476
Let's see how she runs.

1372
00:53:05,447 --> 00:53:06,717
They are in a circle.

1373
00:53:07,277 --> 00:53:09,547
(There is tension in the field.)

1374
00:53:09,547 --> 00:53:10,857
- Get ready. - What are those?

1375
00:53:11,357 --> 00:53:13,286
- Are those batons? - They are batons.

1376
00:53:13,387 --> 00:53:15,286
(They aren't body pillows.)

1377
00:53:15,326 --> 00:53:16,987
Do models need long batons?

1378
00:53:18,226 --> 00:53:20,257
The baton was too big.

1379
00:53:20,726 --> 00:53:21,927
During the relay,

1380
00:53:22,067 --> 00:53:23,896
it was hard to run with it.

1381
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:25,237
I bet it was.

1382
00:53:25,237 --> 00:53:26,637
Even the batons are long.

1383
00:53:26,637 --> 00:53:30,107
(With the batons for models,)

1384
00:53:30,107 --> 00:53:31,277
(the relay begins.)

1385
00:53:31,277 --> 00:53:34,107
The two of them are very fast.

1386
00:53:34,107 --> 00:53:36,246
They are good runners.

1387
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:37,547
The batons are too big.

1388
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:39,116
Run!

1389
00:53:39,116 --> 00:53:42,516
(Lisa's mom overworks her vocal cords.)

1390
00:53:42,987 --> 00:53:45,056
Run! Run!

1391
00:53:47,456 --> 00:53:48,956
My goodness.

1392
00:53:48,956 --> 00:53:50,257
(Team Yi drops the baton.)

1393
00:53:50,257 --> 00:53:51,396
All right!

1394
00:53:53,027 --> 00:53:55,027
(Screaming)

1395
00:53:55,467 --> 00:53:56,797
The runner begins.

1396
00:53:56,797 --> 00:53:58,967
(Team Han is leading.)

1397
00:53:58,996 --> 00:54:00,496
Get ready.

1398
00:54:00,596 --> 00:54:01,866
He is good.

1399
00:54:01,866 --> 00:54:02,967
(He runs like a thief.)

1400
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:07,507
(There is a distance between the runners.)

1401
00:54:09,177 --> 00:54:10,547
Yoon Ju and I were next.

1402
00:54:10,547 --> 00:54:12,146
(It's Hye Jin and Yoon Ju's turn.)

1403
00:54:15,416 --> 00:54:16,846
Yoon Ju.

1404
00:54:16,846 --> 00:54:18,786
- She is slow. - My goodness.

1405
00:54:18,786 --> 00:54:20,257
(How well can Hye Jin run?)

1406
00:54:21,627 --> 00:54:25,357
See? I am running very fast.

1407
00:54:25,556 --> 00:54:27,326
You aren't running very fast.

1408
00:54:27,326 --> 00:54:28,627
You are simply running.

1409
00:54:29,396 --> 00:54:31,896
(Her legs look slower because of their length.)

1410
00:54:31,896 --> 00:54:33,266
Why am I so slow?

1411
00:54:34,936 --> 00:54:37,637
(Lisa's mom is just as slow.)

1412
00:54:38,177 --> 00:54:40,107
Yoon Ju couldn't close the distance.

1413
00:54:40,277 --> 00:54:42,346
The fifth runners are waiting.

1414
00:54:42,407 --> 00:54:44,777
The fifth runners are waiting.

1415
00:54:44,916 --> 00:54:46,177
He is fast.

1416
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:47,916
He runs like the wind.

1417
00:54:48,447 --> 00:54:49,717
I thought I ran like him.

1418
00:54:49,717 --> 00:54:51,056
You ran a bit differently.

1419
00:54:51,157 --> 00:54:52,686
He can run very well.

1420
00:54:52,916 --> 00:54:54,857
(The last runners)

1421
00:54:54,857 --> 00:54:56,427
She can run very well.

1422
00:54:56,657 --> 00:54:57,697
- That person... - It's Hyun Yi.

1423
00:54:57,697 --> 00:54:58,697
It's Hyun Yi.

1424
00:54:58,697 --> 00:55:02,927
(Hyun Yi is determined.)

1425
00:55:03,027 --> 00:55:04,396
Hyun Yi was...

1426
00:55:04,396 --> 00:55:07,067
- in track and fields. - You can't win against her.

1427
00:55:07,067 --> 00:55:08,967
- She is so fast. - Hyun Yi is fast.

1428
00:55:09,067 --> 00:55:11,507
(She gives her last spurt.)

1429
00:55:11,976 --> 00:55:14,277
(If you don't run fast, she will catch up.)

1430
00:55:14,277 --> 00:55:16,607
- She is fast. - She is really fast.

1431
00:55:17,416 --> 00:55:19,846
(She chases after the other runner.)

1432
00:55:21,887 --> 00:55:23,646
She is like Na Ae Ri.

1433
00:55:23,717 --> 00:55:25,516
She resembles Na Ae Ri.

1434
00:55:27,427 --> 00:55:29,127
(When Hyun Yi is close to catching up,)

1435
00:55:30,186 --> 00:55:32,627
(the other runner crosses the finish line.)

1436
00:55:32,826 --> 00:55:35,027
Team Han won.

1437
00:55:35,027 --> 00:55:36,766
(Team Han won.)

1438
00:55:37,996 --> 00:55:39,567
Okay! Team Han won.

1439
00:55:39,567 --> 00:55:40,837
She closed the distance.

1440
00:55:41,366 --> 00:55:42,507
It's a landslide victory.

1441
00:55:43,607 --> 00:55:44,907
We should have run another lap.

1442
00:55:44,976 --> 00:55:47,407
Then I would have caught up.

1443
00:55:47,907 --> 00:55:51,547
(All matches end.)

1444
00:55:52,416 --> 00:55:53,677
That's sad.

1445
00:55:53,976 --> 00:55:55,947
More games were prepared.

1446
00:55:56,146 --> 00:55:58,416
There were 8 to 9 games.

1447
00:55:58,416 --> 00:56:00,257
Thank you for your hard work.

1448
00:56:00,257 --> 00:56:02,627
(The event ends.)

1449
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:05,927
2018 Family Sports Day.

1450
00:56:06,357 --> 00:56:07,666
The winning team is...

1451
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:12,197
(Although they didn't play many games,)

1452
00:56:12,837 --> 00:56:14,737
(they competed fiercely.)

1453
00:56:16,337 --> 00:56:19,036
(The matches were thrilling.)

1454
00:56:20,706 --> 00:56:22,907
(Which team won?)

1455
00:56:22,907 --> 00:56:24,846
Congratulations, Team Han!

1456
00:56:24,846 --> 00:56:26,717
Team Han won.

1457
00:56:27,277 --> 00:56:28,447
It was my first time.

1458
00:56:28,447 --> 00:56:29,786
She beat Hyun Yi for the first time.

1459
00:56:31,556 --> 00:56:32,857
You did a good job.

1460
00:56:32,857 --> 00:56:34,927
(She is happy.)

1461
00:56:37,996 --> 00:56:40,596
(We won.)

1462
00:56:43,197 --> 00:56:47,096
(She gets her photo taken despite the strong wind.)

1463
00:56:52,107 --> 00:56:54,146
(Staggering)

1464
00:56:54,146 --> 00:56:55,277
- She almost fell. - It's very windy.

1465
00:56:55,277 --> 00:56:57,916
People like us can't imagine getting pushed over by the wind.

1466
00:56:59,177 --> 00:57:00,887
Usually, MVP comes from the winning team,

1467
00:57:00,887 --> 00:57:01,987
but we don't care about that.

1468
00:57:02,646 --> 00:57:03,817
I will announce the MVP.

1469
00:57:03,817 --> 00:57:05,456
(It's time to announce the MVP.)

1470
00:57:06,987 --> 00:57:08,186
Jang Yoon Ju!

1471
00:57:08,186 --> 00:57:11,127
(Lisa's mom becomes the MVP.)

1472
00:57:12,427 --> 00:57:15,326
Where is Ms. Sung Ye Jin?

1473
00:57:15,527 --> 00:57:17,536
Where is Ms. Sung Ye Jin?

1474
00:57:17,896 --> 00:57:21,536
Ms. Sung Ye Jin will deliver the award.

1475
00:57:21,536 --> 00:57:23,206
Jang Yoon Ju!

1476
00:57:23,206 --> 00:57:24,936
- She is the MVP. - Jang Yoon Ju!

1477
00:57:24,936 --> 00:57:26,877
(Yoon Ju is the best.)

1478
00:57:27,137 --> 00:57:28,646
- She is the MVP. - Jang Yoon Ju!

1479
00:57:28,646 --> 00:57:31,877
(Unable to contain her good cheer,)

1480
00:57:31,877 --> 00:57:34,547
(she gives a ceremony.)

1481
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:36,646
My goodness.

1482
00:57:36,646 --> 00:57:38,317
(She high fives down the runway.)

1483
00:57:38,317 --> 00:57:40,387
Attention. Bow.

1484
00:57:40,387 --> 00:57:42,286
Please bow.

1485
00:57:43,427 --> 00:57:46,956
(Yoon Ju is happy to receive a gift.)

1486
00:57:47,496 --> 00:57:48,596
(Hye Jin can't stop laughing.)

1487
00:57:48,596 --> 00:57:49,967
Click. Thank you.

1488
00:57:50,697 --> 00:57:52,996
(They take a group picture.)

1489
00:57:54,436 --> 00:57:56,206
(The strong wind made it an eventful day.)

1490
00:57:56,206 --> 00:57:57,637
Thank you for your hard work.

1491
00:57:58,137 --> 00:58:01,277
(Working together brought happiness to Dhalsim's sports day.)

1492
00:58:01,576 --> 00:58:02,607
(I Live Alone)

1493
00:58:03,507 --> 00:58:06,646
(The idiot goes out on a spring day.)

1494
00:58:07,246 --> 00:58:08,646
The star of prostate.

1495
00:58:08,786 --> 00:58:10,487
He will make us laugh again.

1496
00:58:13,116 --> 00:58:15,186
(Two months ago, he got an endoscopy...)

1497
00:58:16,056 --> 00:58:18,357
(and made everyone laugh.)

1498
00:58:19,297 --> 00:58:20,766
I will get ready to laugh.

1499
00:58:23,326 --> 00:58:24,337
My goodness.

1500
00:58:24,337 --> 00:58:25,896
(How will he make people laugh this time?)

1501
00:58:25,967 --> 00:58:27,266
- What is that? - That's the car.

1502
00:58:27,507 --> 00:58:28,967
My goodness.

1503
00:58:28,967 --> 00:58:30,806
- He always brags about it. - It's a supercar.

1504
00:58:31,137 --> 00:58:32,936
- It's a supercar. - Is that Si Eon's car?

1505
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:34,076
Of course it is.

1506
00:58:34,076 --> 00:58:35,947
(It has an elegant body...)

1507
00:58:37,007 --> 00:58:39,416
(and a smooth front.)

1508
00:58:40,887 --> 00:58:44,056
(What kind of a car is this?)

1509
00:58:44,157 --> 00:58:46,257
In the early 90s,

1510
00:58:46,257 --> 00:58:48,757
this car was 1 of the 3 supercars in Japan.

1511
00:58:48,956 --> 00:58:50,657
Mazda RX-7.

1512
00:58:51,127 --> 00:58:52,157
And skyline.

1513
00:58:52,627 --> 00:58:55,967
It was released at an affordable price for a supercar.

1514
00:58:56,396 --> 00:58:59,237
That's why the model was very popular at that time.

1515
00:58:59,436 --> 00:59:01,507
I happened to get the car,

1516
00:59:01,507 --> 00:59:03,536
so I'm taking care of it now.

1517
00:59:04,377 --> 00:59:06,206
I think this model appeared in...

1518
00:59:06,206 --> 00:59:07,806
- "Initial D". - Right. "Initial D".

1519
00:59:07,806 --> 00:59:09,907
- "Initial D"? - I know "Initial D".

1520
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:12,146
However, isn't it expensive?

1521
00:59:12,146 --> 00:59:13,646
- No, it's affordable. - Is it?

1522
00:59:13,646 --> 00:59:16,016
- It's an old model. - It's made in 1993.

1523
00:59:16,286 --> 00:59:18,556
- 1993? - But it was registered in 1994.

1524
00:59:18,556 --> 00:59:19,956
Daejeon Expo was held in 1993.

1525
00:59:21,157 --> 00:59:23,186
That makes me realize how long it's been since then.

1526
00:59:25,657 --> 00:59:27,427
This car looks great though.

1527
00:59:30,326 --> 00:59:31,536
- It just falls down. - Goodness.

1528
00:59:31,536 --> 00:59:33,467
The trunk lid shock damper is broken.

1529
00:59:34,137 --> 00:59:35,536
What if it falls off?

1530
00:59:36,407 --> 00:59:40,607
I should clean you since you're going to meet new friends.

1531
00:59:40,907 --> 00:59:42,846
I haven't seen that car duster for a while.

1532
00:59:42,846 --> 00:59:44,616
People used to use that a lot.

1533
00:59:44,746 --> 00:59:47,447
You can often see the chauffeur of a CEO do that.

1534
00:59:48,846 --> 00:59:51,416
Blue Chip, please do well today.

1535
00:59:52,217 --> 00:59:54,686
- Why do you call it "Blue Chip"? - The car is blue,

1536
00:59:54,686 --> 00:59:57,357
so I named it "Sangdo-dong Blue Chip".

1537
00:59:57,357 --> 00:59:58,596
"Sangdo-dong Blue Chip"?

1538
01:00:01,627 --> 01:00:02,797
Gosh.

1539
01:00:03,326 --> 01:00:05,337
I hope I'll drive this car well.

1540
01:00:05,337 --> 01:00:07,407
- That car can move? - Of course.

1541
01:00:07,407 --> 01:00:09,806
- It runs well. - Does it have windshield wipers?

1542
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:11,237
It has only one.

1543
01:00:14,706 --> 01:00:16,677
(Struggling)

1544
01:00:19,947 --> 01:00:22,387
- What are you doing? - The seat belt wouldn't lock.

1545
01:00:22,516 --> 01:00:25,286
- Gosh. What's that? - It has so many problems.

1546
01:00:25,786 --> 01:00:28,186
The shock damper, windshield wiper, and seat belt.

1547
01:00:28,186 --> 01:00:29,527
My goodness.

1548
01:00:30,387 --> 01:00:31,697
What are you doing?

1549
01:00:31,697 --> 01:00:34,396
- It wouldn't lock up this side. - Really?

1550
01:00:34,396 --> 01:00:36,396
He should put it on in any way, but still, he should fix it.

1551
01:00:38,366 --> 01:00:39,396
Look at that. It's so...

1552
01:00:39,396 --> 01:00:40,837
- It's just amazing. - Look at that old car stereo.

1553
01:00:40,837 --> 01:00:42,206
(The interior looks so old.)

1554
01:00:42,206 --> 01:00:43,366
- What's that? - What's that?

1555
01:00:43,366 --> 01:00:45,377
- Oh, it's a manual car. - Do you have a license?

1556
01:00:45,377 --> 01:00:48,007
- Yes, I do. - You have a manual driving license?

1557
01:00:49,007 --> 01:00:50,047
(Vroom)

1558
01:00:51,547 --> 01:00:53,416
- It runs well. - It runs well.

1559
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:55,846
The wheels might fall off on Gangbyeon Highway.

1560
01:00:56,016 --> 01:00:57,286
Just like teeth fall off.

1561
01:00:57,286 --> 01:00:58,916
- Thump, thump. - Thump, thump.

1562
01:00:58,916 --> 01:01:00,186
If that happens, I'll acknowledge him.

1563
01:01:01,527 --> 01:01:03,127
As a great entertainer.

1564
01:01:03,127 --> 01:01:04,996
- He's so mean. - If two wheels fall off.

1565
01:01:04,996 --> 01:01:06,726
After that, he moves the car with his feet.

1566
01:01:06,726 --> 01:01:08,866
(He moves the car with his feet instead of the wheels?)

1567
01:01:08,866 --> 01:01:09,996
- If that happens, - Hang on.

1568
01:01:09,996 --> 01:01:11,297
I'll make a deep bow to you for the rest of my life.

1569
01:01:11,297 --> 01:01:13,697
- For the rest of my life. - He moves the car like this.

1570
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:16,567
The four of you should go on without me.

1571
01:01:17,137 --> 01:01:18,877
- I feel so uncomfortable. - Where are you going?

1572
01:01:18,877 --> 01:01:21,507
- This isn't right. - You always do this to us.

1573
01:01:21,507 --> 01:01:22,947
- That's right. - Yes.

1574
01:01:25,416 --> 01:01:27,817
This car is so difficult to drive.

1575
01:01:28,817 --> 01:01:30,717
(The hazard lights suddenly come on by themselves.)

1576
01:01:30,717 --> 01:01:32,387
Why did the lights come on again?

1577
01:01:32,857 --> 01:01:35,587
The lights kept coming on by themselves.

1578
01:01:37,697 --> 01:01:40,056
Let's go to Ilsan safely.

1579
01:01:41,996 --> 01:01:45,197
(You didn't seem to be used driving Blue Chip.)

1580
01:01:45,536 --> 01:01:48,607
I hadn't driven a manual car for a long time before then.

1581
01:01:48,607 --> 01:01:51,377
And the clutch was much more sensitive...

1582
01:01:51,377 --> 01:01:53,007
than other manual cars.

1583
01:01:53,306 --> 01:01:56,907
So it was hard for me to get used to driving it.

1584
01:02:03,416 --> 01:02:06,556
Hey, hey. Calm down.

1585
01:02:07,317 --> 01:02:10,286
- I'm getting used to this. - You can drive a manual car.

1586
01:02:10,286 --> 01:02:12,427
Of course. I have a license.

1587
01:02:12,427 --> 01:02:13,927
I'm getting the hang of it now.

1588
01:02:13,927 --> 01:02:15,996
(He's getting used to driving Blue Chip.)

1589
01:02:15,996 --> 01:02:17,127
Nice.

1590
01:02:19,467 --> 01:02:20,866
(Squeak)

1591
01:02:22,706 --> 01:02:25,076
- The car makes a squeaking noise. - Where is it coming from?

1592
01:02:25,076 --> 01:02:26,576
Could there be a rat in your car?

1593
01:02:27,107 --> 01:02:28,377
Then I'll acknowledge you.

1594
01:02:28,377 --> 01:02:30,777
I'll reward you the grand award if there's a rat in there.

1595
01:02:30,777 --> 01:02:32,777
I'll acknowledge you if you stepped on the rat.

1596
01:02:32,777 --> 01:02:34,047
You got me.

1597
01:02:34,846 --> 01:02:36,746
There's a rat at the back.

1598
01:02:36,746 --> 01:02:38,987
I put a rat in the car to make people laugh.

1599
01:02:40,416 --> 01:02:41,826
(Squeak)

1600
01:02:42,056 --> 01:02:44,527
I think the noise is coming from his seat.

1601
01:02:45,956 --> 01:02:47,226
It makes me nervous.

1602
01:02:47,226 --> 01:02:48,866
(The squeaking noise makes him more nervous.)

1603
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:51,297
- Stop squeaking already. - I hate that noise.

1604
01:02:51,297 --> 01:02:53,137
- He made it squeak on purpose. - It's so annoying.

1605
01:02:53,137 --> 01:02:54,866
- Why are you honking? - "Honking"?

1606
01:02:54,866 --> 01:02:56,536
He's speaking in Busan dialect.

1607
01:02:56,907 --> 01:02:58,476
I grew up near the beach.

1608
01:02:58,476 --> 01:03:00,076
(The nostalgic sound of seagulls)

1609
01:03:00,076 --> 01:03:01,206
Near Haeundae Beach?

1610
01:03:04,007 --> 01:03:08,146
(Blue Chip is running cheerfully.)

1611
01:03:13,016 --> 01:03:15,427
But it's running at 40km per hour.

1612
01:03:15,427 --> 01:03:17,496
(Embarrassed)

1613
01:03:17,826 --> 01:03:20,257
It feels like it's running at 150km per hour.

1614
01:03:20,427 --> 01:03:21,596
(Other cars pass by him.)

1615
01:03:21,596 --> 01:03:24,637
It's running really well.

1616
01:03:27,036 --> 01:03:28,467
Gosh, the hazard lights.

1617
01:03:29,407 --> 01:03:31,706
The hazard lights kept coming on by themselves.

1618
01:03:31,706 --> 01:03:33,237
(The hazard lights won't behave themselves.)

1619
01:03:33,237 --> 01:03:34,607
The hazard lights... Gosh.

1620
01:03:36,576 --> 01:03:37,846
(Pressing)

1621
01:03:37,846 --> 01:03:39,576
Oh, I forgot. The car horn doesn't work.

1622
01:03:41,087 --> 01:03:42,217
Even the car horn doesn't work?

1623
01:03:42,217 --> 01:03:44,157
Honking the horn only causes a fight.

1624
01:03:44,387 --> 01:03:46,186
- What are you talking about? - It's better without it.

1625
01:03:49,087 --> 01:03:50,487
Doesn't the radio work?

1626
01:03:54,666 --> 01:03:56,067
(Sniffling)

1627
01:03:58,436 --> 01:03:59,797
My hands are cold.

1628
01:04:01,536 --> 01:04:03,866
- Doesn't the heater work? - I'd feel sleepy if it's too hot.

1629
01:04:03,866 --> 01:04:05,907
"I'd feel sleepy if it's too hot."

1630
01:04:05,907 --> 01:04:07,107
(It's a very inspiring comment.)

1631
01:04:07,107 --> 01:04:09,246
- You would feel sleepy if it's hot. - I removed the function.

1632
01:04:09,246 --> 01:04:11,416
- Really? - I removed the air conditioner too.

1633
01:04:11,416 --> 01:04:12,947
It should be hot in summer.

1634
01:04:12,947 --> 01:04:14,447
"I'd get sick rather than dozing at the wheel."

1635
01:04:14,447 --> 01:04:16,317
"Honking the horn only causes a fight."

1636
01:04:16,317 --> 01:04:18,157
- To keep the peace, - That's right.

1637
01:04:18,157 --> 01:04:20,587
- I removed the horn. - It's a new paradigm for cars.

1638
01:04:22,387 --> 01:04:23,726
All it can do is run.

1639
01:04:24,556 --> 01:04:26,757
That's enough for me.

1640
01:04:28,567 --> 01:04:30,797
Blue Chip's current condition is...

1641
01:04:31,467 --> 01:04:32,996
The car has been completely overhauled.

1642
01:04:33,297 --> 01:04:34,407
- What does that mean? - "Overhauled"?

1643
01:04:34,407 --> 01:04:36,007
Just like a watch,

1644
01:04:36,007 --> 01:04:37,806
I had the engine and everything else checked thoroughly.

1645
01:04:38,777 --> 01:04:40,507
The engine made a really loud noise.

1646
01:04:41,277 --> 01:04:43,047
I thought someone was calling me.

1647
01:04:43,277 --> 01:04:46,277
When I first heard it, I got startled and looked back.

1648
01:04:46,277 --> 01:04:48,186
I realized that it was Blue Chip who was calling me.

1649
01:04:48,786 --> 01:04:52,317
I left the interior as it was in 1994.

1650
01:04:52,887 --> 01:04:54,226
The radio isn't working.

1651
01:04:54,387 --> 01:04:57,896
I saw this color when I turned the heater on.

1652
01:04:57,896 --> 01:04:59,927
- What? - It shocked me.

1653
01:04:59,927 --> 01:05:01,766
- What do you mean by that? - You mean fine dust?

1654
01:05:01,766 --> 01:05:03,127
- I turned the heater on. - Blue smoke came out?

1655
01:05:03,127 --> 01:05:04,766
Then some yellow smoke came out.

1656
01:05:04,766 --> 01:05:06,067
I got so startled.

1657
01:05:06,067 --> 01:05:08,806
That's why I removed the heater...

1658
01:05:08,806 --> 01:05:10,407
along with the air conditioner.

1659
01:05:15,677 --> 01:05:16,877
(The seat belt is choking him.)

1660
01:05:16,877 --> 01:05:19,377
- Look at the seat belt. - It's too tight.

1661
01:05:20,717 --> 01:05:21,846
- Where is he headed? - Where is he headed?

1662
01:05:21,846 --> 01:05:23,087
- Is he headed to a junk yard? - What's that?

1663
01:05:24,857 --> 01:05:26,556
Right? I thought it was a junk yard too.

1664
01:05:26,556 --> 01:05:29,157
- The holy land of classic cars. - "The hold land"?

1665
01:05:30,857 --> 01:05:33,297
(He exclaims while getting out of the car.)

1666
01:05:33,297 --> 01:05:34,996
- That's amazing. - I know that place.

1667
01:05:34,996 --> 01:05:36,366
(It's an outdoor warehouse where various classic cars are displayed.)

1668
01:05:36,366 --> 01:05:38,337
That looks great. I see a lot of old cars.

1669
01:05:38,637 --> 01:05:40,637
- It's amazing. - Look at that Volkswagen car.

1670
01:05:40,637 --> 01:05:42,266
All the cars there can move.

1671
01:05:43,567 --> 01:05:45,507
(This is the world Si Eon was dreaming of.)

1672
01:05:46,637 --> 01:05:47,947
- Is it you? - Hi.

1673
01:05:48,407 --> 01:05:52,877
I met him when I filmed a TV commercial before.

1674
01:05:52,877 --> 01:05:57,047
He runs a class car lending business.

1675
01:05:57,416 --> 01:05:58,817
I heard he has a lot of old cars.

1676
01:05:59,257 --> 01:06:01,887
So I wanted to get some information...

1677
01:06:01,887 --> 01:06:04,456
and take a look around his warehouse.

1678
01:06:05,627 --> 01:06:07,996
Sir, are all these cars yours?

1679
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:09,396
Yes.

1680
01:06:09,927 --> 01:06:11,737
Where did you get such a nice car?

1681
01:06:12,096 --> 01:06:16,206
A friend of mine collects classic cars like this.

1682
01:06:16,536 --> 01:06:19,237
- So... - It's a rare model.

1683
01:06:19,237 --> 01:06:21,447
- Exactly. - He's an expert.

1684
01:06:21,447 --> 01:06:23,277
How did you repair the engine?

1685
01:06:24,047 --> 01:06:25,717
He said he got the engine overhauled.

1686
01:06:25,717 --> 01:06:27,587
- In Korea? - Yes.

1687
01:06:27,587 --> 01:06:28,946
- He's an expert. - He's an expert.

1688
01:06:28,946 --> 01:06:31,116
There aren't many repair shops that can fix a rotary engine, right?

1689
01:06:31,116 --> 01:06:32,187
That's right.

1690
01:06:32,187 --> 01:06:33,687
My car has an unusual engine.

1691
01:06:33,687 --> 01:06:35,227
- A rotary engine? - It's called a rotary engine.

1692
01:06:35,227 --> 01:06:36,826
It's called the legendary engine.

1693
01:06:37,187 --> 01:06:40,097
It doesn't move up and down. It rotates like this.

1694
01:06:40,097 --> 01:06:41,427
Instead of cylinders.

1695
01:06:41,727 --> 01:06:43,326
It's difficult to maintain.

1696
01:06:44,767 --> 01:06:47,236
(He opens the hood.)

1697
01:06:47,536 --> 01:06:49,066
(How is Blue Chip's condition?)

1698
01:06:49,066 --> 01:06:50,666
Please tell me your honest opinion.

1699
01:06:52,076 --> 01:06:54,477
- Isn't it too old? - I can see the history.

1700
01:06:56,547 --> 01:06:59,517
First of all, judging from the way it seems at a glance...

1701
01:06:59,717 --> 01:07:01,916
- What if he says it's bad? - It looks like rats are in there.

1702
01:07:03,187 --> 01:07:06,316
I think it's in good condition. It's not bad.

1703
01:07:06,517 --> 01:07:07,627
- Is it okay? - Yes.

1704
01:07:07,627 --> 01:07:09,786
I heard the car had been overhauled.

1705
01:07:09,986 --> 01:07:11,196
What's the total mileage?

1706
01:07:11,196 --> 01:07:12,397
- 100,000km. - I see.

1707
01:07:12,397 --> 01:07:14,496
- It's quite low. - It's low.

1708
01:07:14,996 --> 01:07:16,297
I should leave the hood open.

1709
01:07:16,297 --> 01:07:19,066
He said I should cool it down after driving.

1710
01:07:19,066 --> 01:07:20,297
That's good for the car.

1711
01:07:20,297 --> 01:07:22,366
You have to take care of it after driving.

1712
01:07:22,866 --> 01:07:24,276
What's that one?

1713
01:07:24,807 --> 01:07:27,276
This is Volkswagen Karmann Ghia made in the 1950s.

1714
01:07:27,276 --> 01:07:28,776
It's gorgeous.

1715
01:07:31,076 --> 01:07:33,217
(Park Hae Jin)

1716
01:07:34,887 --> 01:07:36,847
- It's used for a TV commercial. - That's right.

1717
01:07:36,847 --> 01:07:38,786
(The car appeared in a lot of photos with celebrities.)

1718
01:07:38,786 --> 01:07:42,656
People who have many classic cars lend their cars...

1719
01:07:42,656 --> 01:07:44,356
- They lend their cars. - for a TV commercial shoot.

1720
01:07:44,826 --> 01:07:47,797
They feel so proud of it because their cars appear in a commercial,

1721
01:07:47,797 --> 01:07:49,366
not because they can make money from it.

1722
01:07:49,366 --> 01:07:50,866
- They're proud as the owner. - They have pride.

1723
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:51,866
Right.

1724
01:07:52,736 --> 01:07:54,566
(Si Eon looks at the car more closely.)

1725
01:07:54,706 --> 01:07:56,137
(Exclaiming)

1726
01:07:57,206 --> 01:07:59,406
- Old cars have better interiors. - It's so pretty.

1727
01:07:59,406 --> 01:08:01,047
All the parts are genuine.

1728
01:08:01,647 --> 01:08:03,007
(It makes us exclaim.)

1729
01:08:03,007 --> 01:08:04,377
That car is gorgeous.

1730
01:08:04,816 --> 01:08:06,177
How did he manage the car so well?

1731
01:08:06,177 --> 01:08:09,147
He didn't manage the car. He restored the car.

1732
01:08:09,147 --> 01:08:11,486
He bought the car in a really bad condition.

1733
01:08:11,616 --> 01:08:13,786
He repainted it and fixed everything inside of it.

1734
01:08:13,786 --> 01:08:15,887
He restored the interior as it was in the past.

1735
01:08:15,887 --> 01:08:18,097
(He restored the interior as it used to be.)

1736
01:08:19,156 --> 01:08:22,097
This is unbelievable.

1737
01:08:23,727 --> 01:08:24,897
Was this made in 1950?

1738
01:08:24,897 --> 01:08:26,797
- In 1957. - In 1957?

1739
01:08:27,297 --> 01:08:29,406
- My father was born in 1957. - So was my mom.

1740
01:08:29,406 --> 01:08:30,877
Then you can buy him this car as a gift.

1741
01:08:33,106 --> 01:08:34,377
That car is...

1742
01:08:35,547 --> 01:08:37,007
(Mercedes Benz W114 made in 1968)

1743
01:08:37,007 --> 01:08:39,416
- That looks amazing. - It was made in 1968.

1744
01:08:39,416 --> 01:08:40,847
- In 1968? - Yes.

1745
01:08:40,847 --> 01:08:42,347
It's so gorgeous.

1746
01:08:42,347 --> 01:08:44,087
CEOs in the past used to ride in that kind of car.

1747
01:08:44,956 --> 01:08:46,557
We can see it in movies.

1748
01:08:47,017 --> 01:08:50,057
It's gorgeous. The gear shift stick is on the steering wheel.

1749
01:08:50,456 --> 01:08:51,956
- It's on the steering wheel. - That's right.

1750
01:08:51,956 --> 01:08:53,456
It this a manual car?

1751
01:08:53,456 --> 01:08:54,866
- This is an automatic car. - It's so beautiful.

1752
01:08:54,866 --> 01:08:57,566
He gets the parts from overseas if he can't get them in Korea.

1753
01:08:58,097 --> 01:09:00,166
It says, "automatic".

1754
01:09:00,267 --> 01:09:03,137
At that time, an automatic car was something to show off.

1755
01:09:03,137 --> 01:09:04,477
- At that time? - Yes.

1756
01:09:04,606 --> 01:09:06,977
An automatic car was rare at that time.

1757
01:09:06,977 --> 01:09:08,347
It's hard to believe that it's an automatic car.

1758
01:09:08,347 --> 01:09:09,807
- It's gorgeous. - I know.

1759
01:09:09,807 --> 01:09:12,246
- I think this one is the best. - I know.

1760
01:09:16,147 --> 01:09:19,116
(Welcome to the world of classic cars.)

1761
01:09:19,116 --> 01:09:21,587
- It's beautiful. - It's so pretty.

1762
01:09:23,187 --> 01:09:24,597
It's pretty.

1763
01:09:24,696 --> 01:09:26,427
- I should visit there too. - You had a lot of fun.

1764
01:09:26,427 --> 01:09:27,597
I had so much fun.

1765
01:09:27,597 --> 01:09:28,996
(Various old cars catch your eyes.)

1766
01:09:31,337 --> 01:09:32,897
I like this one. What is it?

1767
01:09:33,597 --> 01:09:36,106
- Classic cars are attractive. - It's fun to watch.

1768
01:09:39,437 --> 01:09:41,606
- This is an amazing place. - Is it?

1769
01:09:41,606 --> 01:09:42,677
Yes.

1770
01:09:43,307 --> 01:09:44,416
I love that red car.

1771
01:09:44,517 --> 01:09:45,746
Look at this car.

1772
01:09:46,517 --> 01:09:47,616
My goodness.

1773
01:09:48,847 --> 01:09:50,116
- Honestly, - It's beautiful.

1774
01:09:50,816 --> 01:09:52,057
this is gorgeous.

1775
01:09:52,057 --> 01:09:53,456
(He can't stop exclaiming because of the beautiful exterior.)

1776
01:09:53,456 --> 01:09:54,627
Take a look at the interior.

1777
01:09:54,627 --> 01:09:55,687
(It's time to see the interior.)

1778
01:09:55,687 --> 01:09:57,526
- Take a look. - Gosh.

1779
01:09:59,026 --> 01:10:00,427
Unbelievable. Look at the steering wheel.

1780
01:10:00,427 --> 01:10:02,227
(Exclaiming)

1781
01:10:02,727 --> 01:10:04,337
- They're all genuine parts. - I see.

1782
01:10:04,397 --> 01:10:05,696
It's so...

1783
01:10:06,337 --> 01:10:08,036
- beautiful. It's beautiful. - Look at the headlights.

1784
01:10:08,036 --> 01:10:09,637
Gosh. It's beautiful.

1785
01:10:09,637 --> 01:10:10,706
(The supercar entertained Si Eon's eyes.)

1786
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:12,507
- Shall I play some music for you? - Music?

1787
01:10:13,236 --> 01:10:14,307
What's that?

1788
01:10:15,606 --> 01:10:17,106
- It's a turntable. - Yes.

1789
01:10:17,517 --> 01:10:18,946
(Won Seok gave Si Eon...)

1790
01:10:18,946 --> 01:10:20,116
It looks good.

1791
01:10:20,217 --> 01:10:22,147
(a retro style turntable as a gift.)

1792
01:10:23,017 --> 01:10:24,856
- It's over 100 years old. - 100 years?

1793
01:10:25,087 --> 01:10:26,956
He has real retro items...

1794
01:10:26,956 --> 01:10:28,026
(It's a hand-operated turntable.)

1795
01:10:28,026 --> 01:10:30,286
- He's expert in retro items. - Yes.

1796
01:10:32,597 --> 01:10:35,566
(Twang)

1797
01:10:36,767 --> 01:10:39,397
- Is it Japanese samurai music? - It's 100-year-old music.

1798
01:10:43,467 --> 01:10:45,736
(What?)

1799
01:10:46,807 --> 01:10:47,977
I feel like a ghost will pop out.

1800
01:10:50,347 --> 01:10:51,547
It was scary.

1801
01:10:51,816 --> 01:10:53,147
It's creepy.

1802
01:10:54,217 --> 01:10:56,916
- When Hyun Moo marries Hye Jin, - Will you give this to them?

1803
01:10:56,916 --> 01:10:58,717
I'll play this music as a wedding march.

1804
01:10:59,456 --> 01:11:01,127
(What is he talking about?)

1805
01:11:02,727 --> 01:11:05,297
(It would feel like this.)

1806
01:11:05,297 --> 01:11:06,627
How slowly should we walk?

1807
01:11:06,627 --> 01:11:08,326
He'll give you that when you two get married.

1808
01:11:08,326 --> 01:11:10,267
- Really? Did he say that? - Yes.

1809
01:11:13,337 --> 01:11:15,606
Among all the cars I have here,

1810
01:11:15,606 --> 01:11:17,606
this one is the oldest.

1811
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:18,776
In what year was it made?

1812
01:11:18,776 --> 01:11:20,177
- It's cute. - It was made in 1956.

1813
01:11:20,177 --> 01:11:21,307
- In 1956? - Yes.

1814
01:11:21,307 --> 01:11:22,946
(It was made in 1956.)

1815
01:11:24,517 --> 01:11:27,147
It has only the essentials inside of it.

1816
01:11:28,517 --> 01:11:30,647
- This is so... - It's very small, isn't it?

1817
01:11:30,647 --> 01:11:32,387
It's so pretty.

1818
01:11:32,757 --> 01:11:35,526
How did they design a car like that in 1956?

1819
01:11:35,627 --> 01:11:37,087
There are a lot of beautiful old cars.

1820
01:11:37,826 --> 01:11:38,956
Check out this one.

1821
01:11:38,956 --> 01:11:40,196
(What car will he show us this time?)

1822
01:11:41,026 --> 01:11:42,797
- Look at the color. - It's from J brand.

1823
01:11:42,797 --> 01:11:45,397
I prefer old car designs to the designs these days.

1824
01:11:45,967 --> 01:11:47,406
Last November...

1825
01:11:49,206 --> 01:11:51,477
Henry took a photoshoot with this car.

1826
01:11:54,007 --> 01:11:57,206
Aren't there cars designed like this these days?

1827
01:11:57,517 --> 01:11:58,576
Yes, there are.

1828
01:11:58,717 --> 01:12:00,576
I should visit there. It's so fun.

1829
01:12:02,786 --> 01:12:03,847
It felt like a new world.

1830
01:12:04,057 --> 01:12:06,616
You know I like retro items.

1831
01:12:07,217 --> 01:12:09,087
They say you fail if you're drenched in the past.

1832
01:12:10,856 --> 01:12:13,397
However, I liked it so much.

1833
01:12:13,397 --> 01:12:14,666
I was so happy.

1834
01:12:16,496 --> 01:12:18,337
May I test drive this car?

1835
01:12:19,337 --> 01:12:20,736
That car is really gorgeous.

1836
01:12:20,906 --> 01:12:23,236
- He managed it so well. - I love the headlights.

1837
01:12:29,647 --> 01:12:31,276
(Dazed)

1838
01:12:32,076 --> 01:12:33,416
Is this your first time in a car with an air-cooled engine?

1839
01:12:33,416 --> 01:12:35,687
- Yes. It's an air-cooled engine? - Yes, it is.

1840
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:39,616
(Vroom)

1841
01:12:39,616 --> 01:12:41,257
(Exclaiming)

1842
01:12:42,187 --> 01:12:44,026
It feels like I'm watching an old American movie.

1843
01:12:45,057 --> 01:12:46,356
- Unbelievable. - Driving that car...

1844
01:12:46,356 --> 01:12:47,866
It's so comfortable to ride in.

1845
01:12:51,536 --> 01:12:52,666
It runs so well.

1846
01:12:55,066 --> 01:12:56,166
It's a manual car.

1847
01:13:00,536 --> 01:13:01,847
The engine sound is great.

1848
01:13:01,847 --> 01:13:02,977
It's really nice.

1849
01:13:02,977 --> 01:13:04,576
(The engine sound makes all men's hearts pound.)

1850
01:13:04,576 --> 01:13:06,517
- It's fabulous. - My car makes a similar sound.

1851
01:13:08,887 --> 01:13:11,986
The engine sound is amazing.

1852
01:13:15,927 --> 01:13:17,057
Does the heater work too?

1853
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:19,297
He's jealous.

1854
01:13:19,456 --> 01:13:20,597
Blue Chip doesn't have it.

1855
01:13:20,597 --> 01:13:22,427
I can hear the engine clearly.

1856
01:13:23,526 --> 01:13:25,397
(Vroom)

1857
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:28,267
I like the sound.

1858
01:13:31,276 --> 01:13:32,536
This car is really great.

1859
01:13:32,536 --> 01:13:33,877
(He enjoys the supercar's engine sound.)

1860
01:13:33,877 --> 01:13:35,007
It's unbelievable.

1861
01:13:35,776 --> 01:13:36,877
(They arrived at Heyri Art Village.)

1862
01:13:36,877 --> 01:13:38,547
We came to the place where it suits the car.

1863
01:13:39,316 --> 01:13:40,746
(Laughing)

1864
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:43,687
Look how this car is drawing attention.

1865
01:13:44,156 --> 01:13:45,316
The car drew everyone's attention.

1866
01:13:45,517 --> 01:13:47,456
- Of course. - I'm not surprised.

1867
01:13:47,727 --> 01:13:49,026
I think they looked at the car first.

1868
01:13:51,257 --> 01:13:52,956
That's right. I'm riding in such a nice car.

1869
01:13:56,496 --> 01:13:57,666
But it's not my car.

1870
01:13:58,437 --> 01:13:59,666
It looks amazing.

1871
01:14:01,406 --> 01:14:02,807
I should take some photos.

1872
01:14:04,406 --> 01:14:06,877
(He gets out of the car to take a photo.)

1873
01:14:10,507 --> 01:14:12,946
He must be proud of his car.

1874
01:14:12,946 --> 01:14:14,047
Of course.

1875
01:14:14,986 --> 01:14:16,387
He's posing as if it's his car.

1876
01:14:16,387 --> 01:14:17,786
(As if it's my car...)

1877
01:14:18,616 --> 01:14:19,717
The car is the main model.

1878
01:14:19,717 --> 01:14:20,986
(I'm the main model.)

1879
01:14:22,156 --> 01:14:24,127
Sir, may I just go around here?

1880
01:14:24,696 --> 01:14:26,097
Are you sure?

1881
01:14:26,356 --> 01:14:28,996
- I'll stop if I can't drive it. - Okay.

1882
01:14:29,267 --> 01:14:31,337
- What if you crush it? - The insurance won't cover that.

1883
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:33,166
His insurance covers all drivers...

1884
01:14:33,166 --> 01:14:35,467
because the car is used for filming.

1885
01:14:36,066 --> 01:14:37,166
That's a relief.

1886
01:14:39,007 --> 01:14:40,576
(Nervous)

1887
01:14:40,576 --> 01:14:41,677
How should I start the car?

1888
01:14:43,177 --> 01:14:44,276
Turn it to the right.

1889
01:14:44,276 --> 01:14:45,446
(The engine starts.)

1890
01:14:45,776 --> 01:14:47,916
(He's proud to have started the engine.)

1891
01:14:51,017 --> 01:14:52,616
The feeling in my hands when I changed gears...

1892
01:14:53,587 --> 01:14:54,727
You seem more confident.

1893
01:14:55,956 --> 01:14:56,986
(His confidence increased.)

1894
01:14:56,986 --> 01:14:58,127
That's good.

1895
01:14:59,856 --> 01:15:03,166
It feels amazing how the car changes gears.

1896
01:15:05,097 --> 01:15:07,566
This is why people who drive a manual car...

1897
01:15:07,866 --> 01:15:09,767
prefer it to an automatic car.

1898
01:15:14,147 --> 01:15:16,576
It was so difficult for a beginner.

1899
01:15:16,576 --> 01:15:17,847
You didn't make the engine stop.

1900
01:15:19,717 --> 01:15:21,916
(He arrived safely.)

1901
01:15:22,116 --> 01:15:23,246
It's beautiful.

1902
01:15:23,246 --> 01:15:25,486
(Was it really different?)

1903
01:15:25,717 --> 01:15:27,757
It's definitely different.

1904
01:15:28,227 --> 01:15:30,187
The model I test drove...

1905
01:15:30,996 --> 01:15:32,597
is a very famous model among that brand's cars.

1906
01:15:32,597 --> 01:15:35,166
It's like red bean paste in red bean paste bun.

1907
01:15:35,666 --> 01:15:37,696
It was amazing. I was happy.

1908
01:15:37,696 --> 01:15:40,807
I thought I didn't deserve to ride in that car.

1909
01:15:40,967 --> 01:15:42,236
I mean it.

1910
01:15:42,736 --> 01:15:44,977
I don't think I can drive it around.

1911
01:15:44,977 --> 01:15:46,977
(Si Eon came back safely in the car that's too good for him.)

1912
01:15:46,977 --> 01:15:48,047
It must've been fun.

1913
01:15:48,047 --> 01:15:49,477
Yes. It was so good.

1914
01:15:50,946 --> 01:15:52,076
I'll get going now.

1915
01:15:52,316 --> 01:15:53,416
See you later.

1916
01:15:53,416 --> 01:15:55,087
- I'll come back soon. - Please come visit me.

1917
01:15:55,147 --> 01:15:56,246
Thank you for everything.

1918
01:15:56,647 --> 01:15:58,517
- Thank you, sir. - Go home safely.

1919
01:15:58,517 --> 01:15:59,887
- I'll visit you again. - Okay.

1920
01:16:03,257 --> 01:16:05,897
(He calls someone as soon as he gets in the car.)

1921
01:16:07,797 --> 01:16:10,066
- Hi, Si Eon. - Young Joon, I'm on my way.

1922
01:16:10,127 --> 01:16:11,767
Prepare the cars for me.

1923
01:16:11,897 --> 01:16:13,366
- Okay. - See you soon.

1924
01:16:13,366 --> 01:16:14,736
- "Cars"? - See you.

1925
01:16:15,937 --> 01:16:17,036
This will be...

1926
01:16:18,477 --> 01:16:20,877
(Are you going to see more cars?)

1927
01:16:21,206 --> 01:16:24,276
There's no fixed market price for old cars.

1928
01:16:24,517 --> 01:16:26,347
Even if you buy an old car today,

1929
01:16:26,347 --> 01:16:28,517
and it breaks down tomorrow, you can't complain about it.

1930
01:16:28,946 --> 01:16:30,316
It's an understandable situation.

1931
01:16:30,547 --> 01:16:32,616
So many old car owners exchange cars with each other.

1932
01:16:33,286 --> 01:16:36,427
I posted a message because I wanted to exchange Blue Chip...

1933
01:16:36,427 --> 01:16:38,456
with an automatic car.

1934
01:16:38,627 --> 01:16:42,166
Classic car owners often exchange their cars.

1935
01:16:42,597 --> 01:16:44,097
- They change cars often. - That's his real name.

1936
01:16:44,297 --> 01:16:45,297
"Lee Bo Yeon".

1937
01:16:45,297 --> 01:16:47,297
- He revealed his real name. - Or I can't get a membership.

1938
01:16:47,536 --> 01:16:49,366
- That's right. - You have to take responsibility.

1939
01:16:55,377 --> 01:16:56,906
Hello? Hello.

1940
01:16:57,677 --> 01:17:00,147
Yes. I was wondering if you're interested in buying my car.

1941
01:17:01,316 --> 01:17:04,387
Honestly, it's not in the best condition.

1942
01:17:08,257 --> 01:17:10,656
You sound like an expert.

1943
01:17:10,656 --> 01:17:11,897
(Inquiries about his car continue.)

1944
01:17:13,356 --> 01:17:16,627
(Si Eon arrived at some place.)

1945
01:17:17,066 --> 01:17:20,337
The person who owns the car I wanted was close by.

1946
01:17:20,437 --> 01:17:21,937
So I asked him to show me his car.

1947
01:17:21,937 --> 01:17:23,736
You two will check each other's car before making a decision.

1948
01:17:24,576 --> 01:17:26,637
(Smiling)

1949
01:17:27,007 --> 01:17:28,246
(Who is Si Eon's friend?)

1950
01:17:28,246 --> 01:17:29,347
Hi.

1951
01:17:30,647 --> 01:17:31,977
He is...

1952
01:17:32,776 --> 01:17:34,847
the CEO of my agency.

1953
01:17:35,047 --> 01:17:38,116
We became friends as we're the same age.

1954
01:17:38,217 --> 01:17:40,116
We became friends once we met.

1955
01:17:40,587 --> 01:17:43,526
I turned on the heater, and something came out.

1956
01:17:43,526 --> 01:17:45,326
- It's because it's old. - It looked like a moth.

1957
01:17:45,326 --> 01:17:46,996
You have to enjoy that too...

1958
01:17:47,127 --> 01:17:49,196
- if you like retro items. - You shouldn't fall for that.

1959
01:17:49,196 --> 01:17:50,866
You must love...

1960
01:17:50,967 --> 01:17:52,897
- even the dust on the item. - He's right.

1961
01:17:52,897 --> 01:17:54,467
That's total nonsense.

1962
01:17:55,036 --> 01:17:56,467
It's just beautiful.

1963
01:17:56,467 --> 01:17:57,906
That model was made after the red car I drove before.

1964
01:17:58,007 --> 01:17:59,276
- It's pretty. - It's nice.

1965
01:17:59,276 --> 01:18:01,307
You used only genuine parts, right?

1966
01:18:01,307 --> 01:18:03,047
(The car won Si Eon's heart.)

1967
01:18:03,047 --> 01:18:04,547
- This one is also amazing. - Right.

1968
01:18:05,147 --> 01:18:06,746
- It looks like a recent model. - That's right.

1969
01:18:06,746 --> 01:18:08,847
- It's not a recent model. - Is that also an old car?

1970
01:18:09,446 --> 01:18:10,856
It was made in 1997.

1971
01:18:10,956 --> 01:18:13,286
But the parts are still being produced.

1972
01:18:13,286 --> 01:18:16,656
Then I can also manage this car.

1973
01:18:16,786 --> 01:18:17,956
No. You have to be able to speak English.

1974
01:18:17,956 --> 01:18:19,326
You can get the parts only from overseas.

1975
01:18:19,326 --> 01:18:20,496
He doesn't hold back.

1976
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:22,597
I'm fluent in English. Don't worry.

1977
01:18:22,597 --> 01:18:24,267
- I can do that. - Is that so?

1978
01:18:24,397 --> 01:18:26,897
I just wanted to exchange my car with his car.

1979
01:18:28,267 --> 01:18:32,137
But this car is worth 20 cars of yours.

1980
01:18:32,137 --> 01:18:34,276
- Of course. - I met my car when I was in my 20s.

1981
01:18:34,276 --> 01:18:35,377
Did you?

1982
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:37,246
Let's talk again when you bring 20 cars of that model.

1983
01:18:37,946 --> 01:18:39,847
(I'm disappointed, my friend.)

1984
01:18:39,847 --> 01:18:42,347
- Honestly, I prefer this one. - You do?

1985
01:18:42,916 --> 01:18:44,687
This is the car that I want the most.

1986
01:18:46,616 --> 01:18:49,187
(Simple, straight lines are the special feature of this car.)

1987
01:18:50,257 --> 01:18:51,496
That's good. I like it.

1988
01:18:53,427 --> 01:18:55,597
Right? This is the sound.

1989
01:18:56,326 --> 01:18:58,566
(Do you hear the sound of sensibility?)

1990
01:18:59,437 --> 01:19:01,706
- Move your car. Let me get out. - Try it first.

1991
01:19:02,566 --> 01:19:05,337
(How's the quality of riding?)

1992
01:19:06,177 --> 01:19:07,307
(This is it.)

1993
01:19:07,307 --> 01:19:08,406
It's good, isn't it?

1994
01:19:10,147 --> 01:19:11,717
It's perfect.

1995
01:19:11,717 --> 01:19:13,316
- It feels great. - I know, right?

1996
01:19:14,147 --> 01:19:16,246
I think you look better in that car.

1997
01:19:16,246 --> 01:19:17,656
- I think that's your car. - He keeps insisting.

1998
01:19:17,656 --> 01:19:19,986
- We agree with him. - That's your car.

1999
01:19:20,456 --> 01:19:21,587
He shuts him out.

2000
01:19:22,326 --> 01:19:23,687
Get out of there.

2001
01:19:23,826 --> 01:19:25,397
Let me take a look at the engine.

2002
01:19:25,397 --> 01:19:26,557
You want to? Sure.

2003
01:19:26,557 --> 01:19:27,797
I... Oh, gosh.

2004
01:19:27,797 --> 01:19:29,097
(That scared me.)

2005
01:19:29,097 --> 01:19:30,967
- What was that? - Do you know how to open it?

2006
01:19:30,967 --> 01:19:32,967
It's different from cars in this generation.

2007
01:19:32,967 --> 01:19:34,906
- It opens this way. - Yes. That's it.

2008
01:19:35,267 --> 01:19:37,437
Have you seen a bonnet opening like this lately?

2009
01:19:37,576 --> 01:19:39,377
- It's old. - Hold on.

2010
01:19:39,377 --> 01:19:40,746
- Why? - I thought you imported it.

2011
01:19:40,746 --> 01:19:42,847
- I did. - It's written in Korean.

2012
01:19:43,347 --> 01:19:44,916
- What's this? - One sung.

2013
01:19:45,217 --> 01:19:46,347
- What? - What's this?

2014
01:19:46,446 --> 01:19:48,047
Oh, come on.

2015
01:19:48,047 --> 01:19:49,246
What's it doing here?

2016
01:19:49,246 --> 01:19:51,687
- He's flustered. - How dare you lie to me?

2017
01:19:51,786 --> 01:19:54,017
- Hey, reduce it by 50,000 dollars. - What?

2018
01:19:54,017 --> 01:19:55,627
Check out the engine.

2019
01:19:55,627 --> 01:19:57,597
Ignore other stuff. This is the whole point.

2020
01:19:57,597 --> 01:19:59,627
This red engine.

2021
01:19:59,696 --> 01:20:01,767
Do you know everything inside here?

2022
01:20:03,196 --> 01:20:04,967
- Close it. - Why?

2023
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:06,366
- I don't know. - No?

2024
01:20:06,496 --> 01:20:09,137
- Tell me what you want. - This is my dream car.

2025
01:20:09,236 --> 01:20:10,606
How about monthly installment?

2026
01:20:11,337 --> 01:20:13,776
- What? - Installment for 20 years.

2027
01:20:13,776 --> 01:20:15,507
Does that mean you'll stay in that company for 20 years?

2028
01:20:15,507 --> 01:20:18,047
Sometimes you can find it on the internet.

2029
01:20:18,076 --> 01:20:21,916
- "Installment for 640 months." - Come on.

2030
01:20:21,916 --> 01:20:23,217
- Really? - Yes.

2031
01:20:23,217 --> 01:20:24,257
Actually I...

2032
01:20:24,257 --> 01:20:26,257
- You love cars. - love cars.

2033
01:20:26,257 --> 01:20:28,456
I actually met a dealer...

2034
01:20:28,456 --> 01:20:30,996
to buy a classic car,

2035
01:20:31,057 --> 01:20:33,356
but when I was test driving,

2036
01:20:33,597 --> 01:20:36,196
- the left turn felt like a u-turn. - Why is that?

2037
01:20:36,196 --> 01:20:37,267
I had to keep turning it.

2038
01:20:37,996 --> 01:20:39,236
It's not power steering wheel.

2039
01:20:39,236 --> 01:20:40,736
"How long do I have to turn it?"

2040
01:20:40,837 --> 01:20:42,236
- Then... - "Just a bit more."

2041
01:20:42,267 --> 01:20:45,337
if you try my car, it'll change your mind.

2042
01:20:45,337 --> 01:20:47,406
- He's trying to sell it. - Does it turn well?

2043
01:20:47,706 --> 01:20:48,807
Bye.

2044
01:20:48,807 --> 01:20:50,377
(He failed to persuade his friend.)

2045
01:20:50,477 --> 01:20:52,977
Yes. Keep it up.

2046
01:20:53,246 --> 01:20:54,316
Okay.

2047
01:20:54,446 --> 01:20:55,547
Keep up the good work.

2048
01:20:55,647 --> 01:20:57,017
- Bye. - Bye.

2049
01:20:57,246 --> 01:20:58,387
Call me.

2050
01:20:58,717 --> 01:21:00,856
Your car looks great. Great job on the repair.

2051
01:21:01,927 --> 01:21:04,257
I bought a car last year and painted it.

2052
01:21:04,257 --> 01:21:06,356
- That was terrible. - That broke down.

2053
01:21:06,597 --> 01:21:09,196
- I heard it broke down. - I know.

2054
01:21:09,196 --> 01:21:11,066
I purchased a new car recently.

2055
01:21:11,536 --> 01:21:12,837
New cars are the best.

2056
01:21:13,866 --> 01:21:14,906
Listen to me.

2057
01:21:14,906 --> 01:21:16,366
Sensibility doesn't last long.

2058
01:21:16,366 --> 01:21:18,406
You have to keep repairing the car again and again.

2059
01:21:18,406 --> 01:21:19,706
- New cars are the best. Done. - Done.

2060
01:21:19,706 --> 01:21:21,307
(Neat ending)

2061
01:21:22,446 --> 01:21:24,916
(Leaving his dream car behind,)

2062
01:21:25,517 --> 01:21:27,986
(where's he heading to?)

2063
01:21:29,286 --> 01:21:30,916
- Where are you going? - I went to eat.

2064
01:21:30,916 --> 01:21:32,587
I haven't had a meal all day.

2065
01:21:32,916 --> 01:21:35,526
(To satisfy his hunger...)

2066
01:21:35,956 --> 01:21:37,856
(Worried)

2067
01:21:37,856 --> 01:21:39,397
Pork belly meat please.

2068
01:21:39,397 --> 01:21:40,557
- What? - Alone?

2069
01:21:40,627 --> 01:21:41,627
Pork belly meat alone.

2070
01:21:41,627 --> 01:21:43,297
(He attempts eating pork belly meat alone.)

2071
01:21:43,897 --> 01:21:47,437
(Pork belly meat looks delicious.)

2072
01:21:49,106 --> 01:21:50,977
It's cruel especially at this hour.

2073
01:21:51,837 --> 01:21:53,307
I'm so hungry. My gosh.

2074
01:21:53,637 --> 01:21:55,446
It looks delicious.

2075
01:21:56,347 --> 01:21:57,717
Enjoy.

2076
01:21:57,717 --> 01:21:58,877
(Enjoy.)

2077
01:21:59,116 --> 01:22:00,946
(Eating)

2078
01:22:01,347 --> 01:22:02,517
I can't watch it.

2079
01:22:02,517 --> 01:22:05,786
- Many people eat meat alone lately. - Yes.

2080
01:22:05,856 --> 01:22:07,356
There's a pork belly meat restaurant for single customers.

2081
01:22:08,486 --> 01:22:10,587
(Everything's fine as long as it's delicious.)

2082
01:22:11,127 --> 01:22:13,297
(She's dying.)

2083
01:22:13,797 --> 01:22:15,996
(What have you learned today?)

2084
01:22:16,026 --> 01:22:17,767
I fell in love at first sight.

2085
01:22:18,366 --> 01:22:20,437
Is this the car I know?

2086
01:22:20,767 --> 01:22:24,837
It looks more wonderful and beautiful than before.

2087
01:22:25,137 --> 01:22:28,076
I think that's why I'm chasing it again.

2088
01:22:28,177 --> 01:22:30,746
I'm going to study classic cars by participating in...

2089
01:22:30,746 --> 01:22:32,517
classic car group,

2090
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:34,717
and make it into a fun hobby...

2091
01:22:34,717 --> 01:22:36,017
which doesn't cost much.

2092
01:22:37,217 --> 01:22:39,517
(He focuses on eating pork belly meat for now.)

2093
01:22:40,887 --> 01:22:44,597
(For the day he meets his dream super car.)
