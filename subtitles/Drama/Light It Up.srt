1
00:00:52,009 --> 00:00:54,387
(man) You'll like this. I guarantee it.

2
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:56,347
(woman) Yes!

3
00:00:56,472 --> 00:00:58,307
Oh, Abe, I love this.

4
00:00:58,432 --> 00:01:01,310
(Abe) Well, you loved it
when you picked it out.

5
00:01:01,435 --> 00:01:04,480
- (woman) OK, open yours.
- I will.

6
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,709
- Did you know?
- No.

7
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:27,712
- He didn't tell you?
- No! I swear to God.

8
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:33,009
Like father, like son.
The two of you are from the same mould.

9
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:38,598
Happy anniversary.

10
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:41,017
Happy anniversary.

11
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:46,647
Are you OK?

12
00:01:46,772 --> 00:01:53,070
- You were tossing and turning all night.
- I know. I don't know what this is.

13
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:56,407
Come on. Let's go get some breakfast.

14
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:00,620
- Danny, are you hungry?
- Yeah, sure.

15
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:03,372
Come on. Let's get something to eat.

16
00:02:39,283 --> 00:02:43,287
Danny, if you're gonna
play with your food,

17
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:47,375
at least you've gotta have fun doing it.

18
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:51,212
There. How's that?

19
00:02:55,716 --> 00:02:59,053
- Are you OK, buddy?
- I don't feel so good.

20
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:09,981
Honey, are you all right?

21
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:20,074
Come on, let's get out of here.

22
00:03:21,325 --> 00:03:24,078
(stammers unintelligibly)

23
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:35,089
Can I get some help over here?
Just relax. Sit down.

24
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:37,008
Here, let me help.

25
00:04:26,682 --> 00:04:29,143
I'm so sorry.

26
00:05:59,358 --> 00:06:01,569
It's the whys that are killing me.

27
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:07,325
Why were we in that restaurant
on that day at that hour?

28
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:12,747
Why did that lunatic get it into his head
to kill my wife and my son?

29
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:17,668
Why not kill me, too?
I mean, he leaves me behind?

30
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,963
Why?

31
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,512
It's just so...

32
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,222
random.

33
00:06:48,824 --> 00:06:51,202
(Abe laughs) Nice job.

34
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,704
I'm the king.

35
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:57,959
- Here, Dad's gonna catch you.
- (Abe laughs)

36
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,045
- You better throw far.
- Don't kill me.

37
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,214
(Abe) What could go wrong?

38
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,007
(woman) Careful.

39
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,135
(Danny) I see you.

40
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:11,806
My dad taught me to swim.

41
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,892
(woman) Would you consider Dad
tall or short? Very short?

42
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:19,522
(Abe) We short people have thick skin cos
it doesn't get stretched over a tall frame.

43
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:27,029
The reason my wife and son
were murdered...

44
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,033
was because of me.

45
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:37,707
Because I wasn’t able to help them
when they needed me most.

46
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,421
(woman) Happy anniversary.

47
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,590
I should've saved them.

48
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,468
I should've saved them.

49
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,637
(woman) Slow motion.

50
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,266
(Danny) Yes!

51
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,727
(woman) The winner. The winner!

52
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,496
(phone rings)

53
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:30,092
(Abe on answering machine)
I know this is upsetting,

54
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:33,679
but I have to be with my wife and son.

55
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,431
Goodbye.

56
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,141
(machine beeps)

57
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:42,355
(man) Christ, Abe, don't do anything
foolish, all right? I'm coming right over.

58
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:48,402
- Is this our OD?
- Yeah.

59
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,447
- You know how many of these he took?
- I don't know, man.

60
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:54,534
(man) Get him on an IV.
Start him on normal saline.

61
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:57,286
(woman) Pulse rate 47 and dropping.

62
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,580
- Putting a line in.
- He's crashing.

63
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,667
Give him atropine. Saline wide open.

64
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,294
- Give him the full amp.
- (woman) We're losing him.

65
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,463
- Asystole.
- Checking respirations.

66
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:10,299
Starting CPR. Come on.

67
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:13,594
- (woman #1) He's dying.
- (woman #2) Come on.

68
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:17,223
- He's still in V-fib.
- (woman #1) No pulse.

69
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:25,690
- (man) Did you give him the full amp?
- (woman #1) Yes. He's not responding.

70
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:14,530
Come back to us. Continue compressions.

71
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,866
No response. Do you wanna call it?

72
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,577
Could be fine V-fib. Give me the paddles.

73
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,623
Charge to 200.

74
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,708
Charged to 200.

75
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,376
(man) Clear.

76
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:41,224
- 300.
- 300.

77
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,559
Clear.

78
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,110
360. Clear.

79
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,913
- 360.
- 360.

80
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,373
Clear.

81
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:30,106
- (woman #1) We've got a sinus rhythm.
- (woman #2) Pressure's climbing.

82
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,441
We're getting a response.

83
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:37,738
It's OK. We brought you back.

84
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:41,325
Check his oxygen saturation.

85
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,912
(woman) Oxygen saturation is good.

86
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:48,082
Blood pressure is 140 over 60.

87
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,351
Hi. You're awake.

88
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:13,065
I'm Sherry Clarke.
You're in Saint Elizabeth's ICU.

89
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:16,986
- Are you my doctor?
- Better. I'm your nurse.

90
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,575
The light hurts my eyes.

91
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,754
- How long have I been here?
- A couple of days.

92
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:40,885
Dr. Karras has been keeping an eye
on you. You're his latest project.

93
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,180
Do you wanna watch some TV?

94
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:49,352
- Anything in particular?
- No.

95
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:55,733
Oh, dude, you lucked out.
This is my favorite movie of all time.

96
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,993
We belong dead.

97
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,754
(static buzzes)

98
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:52,707
Hello, Abe. I’m Dr. Karras.
I'm just gonna have a little look.

99
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,793
- Are you OK?
- I've been better.

100
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,045
Remember why you're here?

101
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:02,550
You were legally dead, but, lucky for you,
modern medicine knows no limits.

102
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:07,430
- I died?
- Technically speaking. You had an NDE.

103
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,808
- I don't know what that is.
- Near-death experience.

104
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:15,897
It's my field of expertise. I fought to make
sure you were my patient. Let me guess.

105
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:21,694
You saw a white light that engulfed you,
almost seemed to beckon you to stay.

106
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,739
Yeah, that's exact...
How did you know that?

107
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:30,161
As many as eight out of ten people who've
had an NDE report seeing a white light.

108
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:33,247
- Freaky, huh?
- What about the light I'm seeing now?

109
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:38,377
- It's probably an aura, a type of residue.
- So it's normal?

110
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:42,381
I'd say we're well beyond
the bounds of normal here, but yes.

111
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:48,721
You'll see 'em less frequently as time
passes and eventually they'll disappear.

112
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,412
(static buzzes)

113
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,405
(crash)

114
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,120
(clown music plays)

115
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,008
(clown music)

116
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:10,845
(music echoes and distorts)

117
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:19,812
(static buzzes and crackles)

118
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:30,615
(distorted electronic voices)

119
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:34,202
(growling)

120
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,128
(distorted electronic voices)

121
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,298
(echoing voice) She's with us.

122
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,384
She's with us.

123
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:53,763
She's with us.

124
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:00,937
So everything looks fine.

125
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:05,650
No masses, no deviations
in your intracranial space.

126
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:08,653
But I've seen it three times
in the past few days.

127
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:10,947
- Seen what?
- The white light.

128
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:16,244
And there's something else.
You're gonna think I'm crazy, but, um...

129
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,832
I'm seeing and hearing
all kinds of electrical stuff.

130
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,420
EVP stands for
electronic voice phenomena.

131
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:31,801
Precognition, the light you're seeing,
all that is part of supernatural white noise.

132
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:35,638
- I've got a grant to study these things.
- So EVP, what exactly is it?

133
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:41,269
It's the recording of the deceased using
a detuned apparatus like a TV or radio.

134
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:45,231
Some people believe that EVP
is the afterlife manifest all around us.

135
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:48,609
Others think it's a charge
or electromagnetic fields,

136
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:53,531
still others that it's a means through
which the dead can communicate with us.

137
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:57,201
Frankly, who knows? As long as
we're not exactly sure what it is,

138
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,329
they'll keep funding my grant.

139
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,967
What are you doing down here?

140
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:18,097
This... is my EVP room.

141
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:23,895
These have been detuned and I record 'em
to see if I've captured any transmissions.

142
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,982
I suppose that's an important part
of your work, then?

143
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,277
That? Oh.
No, I didn't want to detune that one.

144
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:36,616
That's Change of Habit.
I' recording it for research purposes.

145
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:41,370
I thought I might learn something
from Dr. Presley.

146
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:44,624
- You're not a fan of this one?
- No, it's just...

147
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:48,002
I just saw one of those things
on the screen.

148
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,632
Transmissions are only visible
after they've been recorded.

149
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:55,051
On the last close-up of Elvis,

150
00:18:55,176 --> 00:19:00,723
I saw a blast of static with
what looked like an unformed person.

151
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:12,276
- So what are you doing now?
- I've rewound the feed, I'll detune it.

152
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,446
Let's see if you really saw something.

153
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,333
There. There, that's it. That's it.

154
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:30,837
That was it. That's what I saw.

155
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:35,466
(shrieking)

156
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,637
- I'll be damned.
- So what does that mean?

157
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:44,767
Maybe when you had your NDE,
you yourself became a detuned receiver.

158
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:51,107
You see white-noise transmissions, EVP,
communications with the dead, all that,

159
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:53,276
without any of this.

160
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,904
You're in uncharted territory.

161
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:01,284
There's a very good chance you're
going to be seeing some wacky stuff.

162
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,706
I've got to go.
I've got a doctor's appointment.

163
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:10,877
Sure. Take all the time you need.
Hey, I'm still saving all the newspaper clippings

164
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:13,546
and articles about the shooting and stuff.

165
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:17,884
I don't want to hear about the day my wife
and son were brutally murdered, OK?

166
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:21,053
I just can't handle that right now. I...

167
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,764
I refuse.

168
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,688
Hi. Dr. Karras asked...

169
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,524
What's wrong?

170
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,194
Dr. Karras is dead.

171
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:40,615
- What?
- He had a heart attack early this morning.

172
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:50,166
I'm sorry.

173
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:12,980
- (man) OK, so this...
- EVP.

174
00:21:13,523 --> 00:21:15,691
EVP.

175
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,528
It draws your attention to the white light.

176
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:22,657
When you see the light, you think
it means... What do you think it means?

177
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:27,453
That somebody's gonna die. Like with
Dr. Karras, it could be a couple of days.

178
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:33,334
With the woman, it could be hours,
just depending on how strong the light is.

179
00:21:33,459 --> 00:21:38,422
I don't know, but I'm seeing it more and
it's driving me nuts. It's like being God.

180
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:42,844
- I'm worried about you, Abe.
- Well, how would you explain it, then?

181
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:45,638
How about, "I don't know"?

182
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:50,017
In a city, we probably cross paths with
people who are about to die all the time.

183
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,854
- We just don't know it.
- But what if I do, Marty?

184
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:55,189
What if I do know
when somebody will die?

185
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:59,777
- And now you've got this superpower?
- It's not a superpower.

186
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:06,242
Call it what you want, but that sure as hell
sounds like superhero bullshit to me.

187
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,661
Stop talking all this nonsense.

188
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,375
(static crackles)

189
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:51,329
(car horn blares)

190
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:59,003
(echoing whispers)

191
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:03,090
(lights buzz)

192
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,347
(clattering)

193
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:54,433
Come on, you stupid thing.

194
00:23:55,852 --> 00:23:57,895
Get over the track.

195
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:07,405
- Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
- Come on!

196
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:09,782
Hey!

197
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:12,034
You've gotta move!

198
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,452
(train whistle)

199
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,080
Come on!

200
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:18,457
Get out of there!

201
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:28,426
Move!

202
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:34,724
Hey!

203
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:40,771
- Get outta there!
- I can't! My foot's caught! Help me!

204
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,859
Help me!

205
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:47,403
Get off the track!

206
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:53,075
Move!

207
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:34,200
(echoing) I'm so sorry.

208
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:03,020
(distorted voice echoes)

209
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:26,502
(voice continues)

210
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:11,088
(clattering)

211
00:27:31,192 --> 00:27:34,237
(rattling)

212
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:48,334
(faint voices)

213
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:19,699
(echoing voices whisper)

214
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:25,288
(voices fade)

215
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:50,021
- (Marty) Yeah?
- How'd you feel about me dropping by?

216
00:28:50,146 --> 00:28:53,441
Abe, uh...
Yeah, sure. When?

217
00:28:53,566 --> 00:28:56,235
How does right freaking now grab you?

218
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,404
Thanks.

219
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:06,078
(static crackles)

220
00:29:06,204 --> 00:29:08,289
What the...?

221
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,710
No way.

222
00:29:16,631 --> 00:29:18,799
(man) Son of a bitch.

223
00:29:33,523 --> 00:29:35,691
Excuse me, sir

224
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:38,444
- dammit.
- You should get out.

225
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:43,241
Beat it, kid. I've dropped a couple
of lug nuts. I think I can handle it.

226
00:29:47,912 --> 00:29:50,164
I don't think that bumper is gonna hold.

227
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:54,335
Look, I don't need some dipshit kid
telling me what to do, OK?

228
00:29:54,460 --> 00:30:00,132
So you can take your metrosexual ass
back to your yuppie car and...

229
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:02,885
- Whoa!
- What are you doing?

230
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:06,305
- The bumper was gonna...
- Get away from me.

231
00:30:25,283 --> 00:30:28,286
I owe you my life.

232
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:47,847
No, Marty, I swear to God, I am fine.

233
00:30:47,972 --> 00:30:50,683
All right. All right, but maybe you should...

234
00:30:50,808 --> 00:30:54,103
I don't know, take a little time off
or something, you know.

235
00:30:54,228 --> 00:30:59,150
- I don't want you overdoing it.
- All right. I'll think about it. Thanks.

236
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:24,050
You saved somebody's life tonight.

237
00:31:38,606 --> 00:31:42,193
- (woman) Would you consider Dad tall?
- No, no, short.

238
00:31:42,318 --> 00:31:44,028
(woman) Very short?

239
00:31:44,153 --> 00:31:47,323
- (Danny) No offence.
- We short people have thick skin

240
00:31:47,448 --> 00:31:49,992
cos it doesn't get stretched
over a tall frame.

241
00:31:50,117 --> 00:31:51,911
Yeah. True.

242
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:58,251
There's the Austrian coach. Looks like
she's trying to throw him. Ha! Nice job!

243
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,475
(static buzzes)

244
00:32:44,964 --> 00:32:46,632
Shit!

245
00:32:51,512 --> 00:32:55,516
- Two weeks? That's so far.
- I know.

246
00:32:55,641 --> 00:32:58,311
- I'll have to come.
- Yeah.

247
00:33:01,105 --> 00:33:04,775
Ugh! OK. Three-martini lunches,
here I come.

248
00:33:06,277 --> 00:33:09,489
I'll be right there
to put the easy into listening.

249
00:33:11,616 --> 00:33:16,662
- Jesus Christ!
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

250
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:22,710
- Don't worry. You can make it up to me.
- Just take it easy.

251
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:26,881
I might even let you pick up overtime
in my hotel room, you know what I mean?

252
00:33:27,006 --> 00:33:29,842
- Hey, come on.
- Just leave it.

253
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:32,470
All right, that's enough.

254
00:33:33,513 --> 00:33:35,640
- Stop it!
- Get him!

255
00:33:35,765 --> 00:33:39,977
Stop it, you're hurting him!
Stop it, you're hurting him!

256
00:33:47,026 --> 00:33:48,903
Hey! Hey!

257
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:52,949
- Hey!
- (man) Shit! Guys, guys!

258
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:55,076
Hey!

259
00:33:59,497 --> 00:34:02,917
- Help! Help!
- Let's go.

260
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:05,127
I'm slipping!

261
00:34:05,253 --> 00:34:07,755
Please, pull me up.

262
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,299
Pull me up!

263
00:34:19,976 --> 00:34:22,186
Are you OK?

264
00:34:28,609 --> 00:34:30,778
Yeah, he's gonna be fine.

265
00:34:31,821 --> 00:34:34,157
Me, I'm not so sure about.

266
00:34:49,088 --> 00:34:53,759
(Marty) Abe, I missed you at work today.
I guess you decided to take that time off.

267
00:34:53,885 --> 00:34:57,180
Give me a call when you get a chance,
all right? Later.

268
00:34:57,305 --> 00:35:00,349
Playing God for another day.

269
00:35:13,821 --> 00:35:15,531
- Hello?
- Hey, Marty.

270
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:19,202
I'm on my way to the hospital
to check on that kid I helped earlier.

271
00:35:19,327 --> 00:35:21,996
- Would you meet me there?
- Uh, yeah. Sure.

272
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:24,373
Great. And...

273
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:28,711
that stuff you're holding for me,

274
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:31,172
will you bring it?

275
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:33,257
I'm ready.

276
00:35:33,382 --> 00:35:35,927
- OK, sure.
- Thanks.

277
00:35:37,929 --> 00:35:39,805
(elevator door pings)

278
00:35:42,558 --> 00:35:45,019
Hey.

279
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:46,354
(Marty) Hey.

280
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:51,150
- Thank you very much for meeting me.
- No problem, man.

281
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:54,320
There are things in here
that are gonna reopen wounds.

282
00:35:54,445 --> 00:35:56,864
- Are you sure you're ready?
- I'm positive.

283
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:59,575
- OK.
- Thanks.

284
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,412
- Hey, call me if you need anything.
- I will.

285
00:36:09,126 --> 00:36:11,128
Hey there.

286
00:36:11,254 --> 00:36:15,132
- Oh, hey. Mr. Dale.
- I was checking to see how Kurt's doing.

287
00:36:15,258 --> 00:36:17,593
Needed stitches, a few scrapes, bruises,

288
00:36:17,718 --> 00:36:22,014
and we're doing a keep overnight
to make sure there's no concussion...

289
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:24,976
- (voices echo)
...but he should be fine.

290
00:36:25,101 --> 00:36:27,436
(echoing voices continue)

291
00:36:27,562 --> 00:36:29,564
Thanks.

292
00:36:45,788 --> 00:36:47,957
(echoing voices continue)

293
00:37:18,654 --> 00:37:20,490
(voices get louder)

294
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:25,411
(voices whisper)

295
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:39,967
Oh, come on.

296
00:37:43,012 --> 00:37:44,931
(elevator door pings)

297
00:38:47,493 --> 00:38:49,871
Not a word.

298
00:39:10,057 --> 00:39:12,310
You bitch!

299
00:39:52,183 --> 00:39:55,520
Hey. Hey, are you OK?

300
00:39:55,645 --> 00:39:57,313
Yeah.

301
00:39:57,563 --> 00:39:59,774
Yeah.

302
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:03,069
I think you just saved my life.

303
00:40:05,029 --> 00:40:10,868
Well, it's beginning to be a fucking habit.
Trust me, it's no big deal.

304
00:40:10,993 --> 00:40:15,706
- Dude, it was my life.
- Well, I didn't mean it like that.

305
00:40:16,999 --> 00:40:19,585
It's you.

306
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:22,672
Yeah. Yeah, you were my nurse.

307
00:40:33,808 --> 00:40:36,519
It's busted.

308
00:40:38,229 --> 00:40:40,731
I'm so sorry.

309
00:40:43,151 --> 00:40:45,403
That's OK.

310
00:40:45,528 --> 00:40:47,613
- You're hurt. Let me look.
- It's fine.

311
00:40:47,738 --> 00:40:49,782
Hey.

312
00:40:51,284 --> 00:40:55,163
Let me fix you up.
It's the least I can do. Come on.

313
00:40:56,831 --> 00:41:02,545
It's a superficial laceration. Nothing a few
stitches and antibiotics can't take care of.

314
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:07,842
You are either staring at my ring
or admiring my rack. Which is it?

315
00:41:07,967 --> 00:41:11,596
- The ring. I was...
- I'm just kidding.

316
00:41:12,555 --> 00:41:15,892
It's my old wedding ring.
My husband died a couple of years ago

317
00:41:16,017 --> 00:41:19,437
so I like to keep it close to my heart.

318
00:41:20,605 --> 00:41:23,441
You must have loved him very much.

319
00:41:24,525 --> 00:41:25,860
Yeah.

320
00:41:26,986 --> 00:41:31,616
He was a music teacher
at Sacred Heart Elementary,

321
00:41:31,741 --> 00:41:34,202
and those kids adored him.

322
00:41:34,327 --> 00:41:38,998
He had a unique approach. No doh-ray-mi
crap. He'd organize this recital every year,

323
00:41:39,123 --> 00:41:43,377
have the kids sing Bowie, Pink Floyd,
Rush, The Beach Boys, Jane's Addiction.

324
00:41:43,503 --> 00:41:47,757
- You name it.
- Sounds amazing.

325
00:41:47,882 --> 00:41:51,469
Yeah. It was incredible.

326
00:41:51,594 --> 00:41:55,848
But the end just... It came so quick.

327
00:41:57,350 --> 00:42:00,770
One day we're just living, you know?

328
00:42:01,437 --> 00:42:05,233
Then, boom, he's dead.

329
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:08,736
That's terrible.

330
00:42:08,861 --> 00:42:10,696
Yeah.

331
00:42:11,739 --> 00:42:13,950
But...

332
00:42:14,075 --> 00:42:16,494
I wake up

333
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:18,704
and it just hit me.

334
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:22,500
I had to let Tommy go.

335
00:42:23,417 --> 00:42:27,046
I'll see him again someday. Until then,

336
00:42:27,171 --> 00:42:30,466
you have to accept
what it's supposed to be about.

337
00:42:35,263 --> 00:42:38,391
- Did you two have any kids?
- No.

338
00:42:38,516 --> 00:42:42,228
No. But I still put on the recital
every year in his honor.

339
00:42:42,353 --> 00:42:44,814
The next one's in a couple of days.

340
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:50,111
- And you should totally come.
- Maybe.

341
00:42:53,114 --> 00:42:55,950
Here.

342
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:00,329
Take this. Think it over.

343
00:43:00,454 --> 00:43:03,332
Call me if you're interested.

344
00:43:03,833 --> 00:43:06,419
Hey, the cops are here.

345
00:43:06,544 --> 00:43:09,589
Yeah. Tell them their timing sucks.

346
00:43:32,987 --> 00:43:37,366
(Danny) Is this the present you got Dad
for your anniversary? Can I see it? Can I?

347
00:43:37,492 --> 00:43:40,244
I don't suppose your dad
put you up to this, did he?

348
00:43:40,369 --> 00:43:44,749
(Danny) No way. Just wondering is all.
I bet it's that watch he wanted, right?

349
00:43:44,874 --> 00:43:47,627
You tell your dad
that he's just gonna have to wait.

350
00:43:47,752 --> 00:43:50,171
Besides, it's just a few days away.

351
00:43:52,757 --> 00:43:54,342
(bus horn blares)

352
00:43:55,927 --> 00:43:59,931
- Are you all right?
- I'm OK, Mom. That man saved our lives.

353
00:44:00,056 --> 00:44:02,850
Thank you!

354
00:44:02,975 --> 00:44:05,811
That's all right.

355
00:44:21,369 --> 00:44:23,704
That's all right.

356
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,294
Henry Caine.

357
00:45:11,419 --> 00:45:13,963
(electronic whine)

358
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:20,052
(electronic screech)

359
00:45:58,966 --> 00:46:03,179
(echoing electronic voice) Should not
have saved. Should not have saved.

360
00:46:03,304 --> 00:46:07,600
Should not have saved.
Should not have saved.

361
00:46:07,725 --> 00:46:11,187
(woman whispers) Should not...

362
00:46:11,312 --> 00:46:14,982
have saved.

363
00:47:01,279 --> 00:47:05,700
- Julia Caine? My name is Abraham...
- Abraham Dale.

364
00:47:05,825 --> 00:47:09,078
I always knew you'd come.
Please, come on in.

365
00:47:09,203 --> 00:47:12,248
Excuse the mess. We're moving.

366
00:47:34,562 --> 00:47:38,399
I am so sorry for what my husband did
to your wife and son.

367
00:47:38,524 --> 00:47:44,113
Henry was the most down-to-earth, don't -
question-things guy you could ever meet.

368
00:47:44,238 --> 00:47:46,365
So, uh...

369
00:47:48,242 --> 00:47:50,786
so what happened, then?

370
00:47:50,912 --> 00:47:53,539
He, uh...

371
00:47:53,664 --> 00:47:56,125
he had a near-death experience.

372
00:47:57,376 --> 00:47:59,712
He was hit by a drunk driver head-on.

373
00:47:59,837 --> 00:48:04,425
He must have died three times that night.
They finally revived him in the early hours

374
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:08,054
and then we brought him home
a week later.

375
00:48:08,179 --> 00:48:10,223
That's when it all began -

376
00:48:10,348 --> 00:48:15,436
the strange behaviour,
the weird ideas about life, about death.

377
00:48:15,561 --> 00:48:18,314
He just got so obsessed
with the paranormal.

378
00:48:18,439 --> 00:48:23,903
EVP, the white light,
precognition, all that kind of stuff.

379
00:48:24,028 --> 00:48:27,281
He even thought he could save people.

380
00:48:28,407 --> 00:48:31,994
At first I thought it was understandable.
This man almost died.

381
00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:36,249
But then it just got to be too much.

382
00:48:36,374 --> 00:48:38,459
What do you mean by too much?

383
00:48:42,964 --> 00:48:45,716
I'll show you.

384
00:49:08,906 --> 00:49:11,784
You see? I'll leave you to it.

385
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:14,217
Oh, shit!

386
00:52:21,057 --> 00:52:22,934
(screeching)

387
00:52:27,647 --> 00:52:29,941
(echoing voices)

388
00:52:41,744 --> 00:52:44,664
Henry was always blowing fuses in here.

389
00:52:44,789 --> 00:52:47,750
Really? Hm.

390
00:52:47,875 --> 00:52:49,794
Um...

391
00:52:51,003 --> 00:52:54,465
do you have any idea
what the "e" stands for?

392
00:52:54,590 --> 00:52:55,758
No.

393
00:52:57,260 --> 00:53:00,429
Would you mind if I took
some of this stuff to look over?

394
00:53:00,555 --> 00:53:03,015
Sure. I don't want any of it.

395
00:53:04,433 --> 00:53:08,563
Look, I am sorry again
for what my husband did.

396
00:53:08,688 --> 00:53:11,607
I can't believe how far gone he is.

397
00:53:11,732 --> 00:53:15,236
- "Is"? What are you talking about?
- What do you mean?

398
00:53:15,361 --> 00:53:18,489
- You said "is".
- And?

399
00:53:18,614 --> 00:53:22,160
Don't you mean "was"?
"How far gone he was"?

400
00:53:22,285 --> 00:53:24,328
You don't know?

401
00:53:28,583 --> 00:53:33,713
- (Julia) Henry's still alive.
- (Abe) I saw him pull the trigger.

402
00:53:33,838 --> 00:53:36,841
(Julia) He survived.
He's over at Belmont County.

403
00:53:36,966 --> 00:53:39,010
(Abe) The asylum.

404
00:53:49,604 --> 00:53:52,607
We keep him up here.
He's been with us a couple of months,

405
00:53:52,732 --> 00:53:55,234
since he slipped out of coma land.

406
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:58,446
If you ask me,
he ain't never gonna see a courtroom.

407
00:53:58,571 --> 00:53:59,864
Why?

408
00:53:59,989 --> 00:54:02,783
Old Henry...

409
00:54:02,909 --> 00:54:05,536
he sees dead people.

410
00:54:15,963 --> 00:54:22,178
Don't mind me. I'm just gonna stick
around and make sure you boys play nice.

411
00:54:26,766 --> 00:54:29,227
My wife and my son.

412
00:54:31,562 --> 00:54:33,898
Why did you do it?

413
00:54:34,023 --> 00:54:36,984
Why did you kill them?

414
00:54:39,195 --> 00:54:42,532
If save, must kill.

415
00:54:43,825 --> 00:54:46,828
Jesus, you're even crazier
than I thought you'd be.

416
00:54:46,953 --> 00:54:48,996
If save,

417
00:54:50,081 --> 00:54:52,792
responsible.

418
00:54:52,917 --> 00:54:55,628
Responsible for what?

419
00:54:56,671 --> 00:54:59,215
Consequences.

420
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:01,676
Horrific consequences.

421
00:55:02,176 --> 00:55:04,262
What consequences?

422
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:30,037
It will never end if you let him in.

423
00:55:33,416 --> 00:55:37,044
You cannot shut the dead out.

424
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:41,507
The dead will haunt you
until you put right what you've done.

425
00:55:42,175 --> 00:55:45,011
If you save, you must...

426
00:55:45,136 --> 00:55:47,763
you must kill.

427
00:55:48,973 --> 00:55:51,475
Tria Mera.

428
00:55:53,936 --> 00:55:55,730
Tria Mera.

429
00:55:56,981 --> 00:55:59,775
- Trio what?
- Tria Mera!

430
00:56:10,661 --> 00:56:12,038
(alarm bell)

431
00:56:14,957 --> 00:56:17,084
If save, must kill.

432
00:56:35,061 --> 00:56:38,022
If save, must kill.

433
00:56:38,272 --> 00:56:43,069
If save, must kill. If save, must kill!

434
00:57:48,217 --> 00:57:51,095
It's a three.

435
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:55,516
What does a three
have to do with the devil's signature?

436
00:57:55,641 --> 00:57:57,685
(knock at door)

437
00:58:06,736 --> 00:58:09,155
- Hi, Abe.
- Hi.

438
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:14,076
So I just finished the rehearsals for
that recital thingy I was telling you about,

439
00:58:14,202 --> 00:58:17,663
so I was basically in the neighborhood,

440
00:58:17,788 --> 00:58:19,081
and, uh...

441
00:58:19,207 --> 00:58:21,501
Hi.

442
00:58:21,626 --> 00:58:25,379
- I hope you don't mind that I stopped by.
- No, no. I don't...

443
00:58:25,505 --> 00:58:27,548
I don't mind. Um...

444
00:58:28,633 --> 00:58:31,177
But why?

445
00:58:31,302 --> 00:58:33,346
When...

446
00:58:34,555 --> 00:58:37,141
is the last time you drank
a cheap bottle of wine?

447
00:58:37,266 --> 00:58:40,520
That's very kind,
but you really don't have to do that.

448
00:58:40,645 --> 00:58:42,897
I know I don't have to.

449
00:58:43,022 --> 00:58:45,024
I want to.

450
00:58:45,149 --> 00:58:47,068
I'm married.

451
00:58:49,111 --> 00:58:51,656
But thank you.

452
00:58:53,366 --> 00:58:56,494
Abe, I read your file.

453
00:58:57,203 --> 00:58:59,789
I know why you were in the ICU
when we first met.

454
00:58:59,914 --> 00:59:03,543
I know what happened
to Rebecca and Danny.

455
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:07,463
You saved my life the other night.

456
00:59:08,047 --> 00:59:10,842
I'd love to return the favor.

457
00:59:20,226 --> 00:59:23,020
(echoing voices whisper)

458
00:59:55,386 --> 00:59:58,890
- (Abe) I like the hair color.
- (Sherry) Purple was good, but...

459
00:59:59,015 --> 01:00:02,393
- (Abe) It goes with the wine.
- Right.

460
01:00:02,518 --> 01:00:04,937
This is great. It really is.

461
01:00:05,062 --> 01:00:07,356
Thank you very much.

462
01:00:08,441 --> 01:00:11,569
- To bad wine and good company.
- Oh, it's bad.

463
01:00:16,991 --> 01:00:19,535
You gotta get out
and do stuff like this, though.

464
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:22,747
It's the only way you'll make it through.

465
01:00:27,376 --> 01:00:30,505
Danny and Rebecca were my everything.

466
01:00:32,089 --> 01:00:34,467
And Tommy was mine.

467
01:00:35,718 --> 01:00:38,513
But you can't just throw in the towel, Abe.

468
01:00:50,858 --> 01:00:53,277
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

469
01:00:53,402 --> 01:00:54,904
O'Malley's.

470
01:00:55,029 --> 01:00:59,826
I gotta kick your ass in a game of pool
to get back the 2.50 I spent on the wine.

471
01:00:59,951 --> 01:01:02,161
2.50?

472
01:01:03,079 --> 01:01:04,163
You got ripped off.

Eight ball, corner pocket.

474
01:01:16,926 --> 01:01:18,177
OK.

475
01:01:18,302 --> 01:01:20,763
How about double or nothing?

476
01:01:21,848 --> 01:01:23,891
All right.

477
01:01:26,352 --> 01:01:28,896
Rack 'em up, big boy.

478
01:01:50,543 --> 01:01:52,253
- Sorry.
- No, it's OK.

479
01:01:52,378 --> 01:01:55,089
No, I, uh... I shouldn't have done that.

480
01:01:55,214 --> 01:01:59,427
- Not tonight, anyway.
- No, it's OK. It's crazy, but it's OK.

(newsreader) Breaking news.
A tragic accident downtown

482
01:02:05,892 --> 01:02:08,478
has left six people dead
and several injured.

483
01:02:08,603 --> 01:02:11,230
An elderly man driving an orange van...

484
01:02:14,192 --> 01:02:17,153
...crashed into a crowded
bus shelter. So far...

485
01:02:19,113 --> 01:02:20,615
Are you OK, Abe?

486
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:24,994
Witnesses say the van appeared to
deliberately swerve for the commuters...

487
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:26,579
Yeah. Um...

488
01:02:27,079 --> 01:02:29,207
Sherry, I gotta go.

489
01:02:29,332 --> 01:02:32,376
- Is it someone you know?
- Yeah.

490
01:02:32,502 --> 01:02:34,545
I'll call you, OK?

491
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:40,718

If save, must kill.

"The third day"?

493
01:03:06,911 --> 01:03:11,833
Authorities found George Sutter in his
kitchen, no attempt to cover up his spree.

494
01:03:11,958 --> 01:03:16,963
The bodies of his wife and children were
found in their beds, butchered so severely

495
01:03:17,088 --> 01:03:20,091
that dental records
will be necessary for an ID.

496
01:03:20,216 --> 01:03:22,677
Sutter has no history of domestic violence

497
01:03:22,802 --> 01:03:25,763
and, when pressed,
could offer no explanation as to...

01:03:25,888 --> 01:03:30,017
(newsreader #2) Beverly Ann Cloy,
a registered nurse for the past 27 years,

499
01:03:30,143 --> 01:03:35,231
smothered 14 of her patients this morning.
She then clocked out and calmly...

500
01:03:35,356 --> 01:03:39,777
(newsreader #3) There's no explanation
why Dickson lost control of the plane...

501
01:03:39,902 --> 01:03:45,032
- (newsreader #2)... absolutely no reason...
- (newsreader #1)... offer no explanation...

502
01:03:45,158 --> 01:03:47,702
Always on the third day...

503
01:03:48,786 --> 01:03:51,414
after Caine saved them.

504
01:04:02,967 --> 01:04:08,055
(newsreader) Authorities are confounded
as to why the man drove into the bus stop,

505
01:04:08,181 --> 01:04:12,143
and we are told
that there is no obvious ulterior motive.

508
01:04:22,069 --> 01:04:26,616
What about the devil?
What does he do on the third day?

509
01:04:28,951 --> 01:04:31,078
What's the thing with the third day?

count the number of the beast:

(Abe) Third day...

01:05:31,305 --> 01:05:34,058

That kid I saved on the bridge.

535

Today's the third day.

536
01:09:12,485 --> 01:09:17,573
I brought him into the hospital
the day I helped you. I need to find him.

537
01:09:17,698 --> 01:09:19,909
I really shouldn't be doing this, Abe.

538
01:09:20,034 --> 01:09:22,870
Seems to be par for the course
with us, Sherry.

539
01:09:22,995 --> 01:09:25,039
Yeah.

540
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:29,335
OK, Kurt Green.

541
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:32,922
- Sir Alfred Hotel.
- Sir Alfred. Of course. Thank you, Sherry.

542
01:09:33,047 --> 01:09:35,633
- Abe.
- Yeah.

543
01:09:35,758 --> 01:09:38,427
Are we OK?

544
01:09:38,553 --> 01:09:40,054
I hope so.

545
01:09:41,973 --> 01:09:43,850

01:10:33,065 --> 01:10:35,067
- Yeah.
- Abe, jeez.

551
01:10:35,193 --> 01:10:38,446
Marty, listen,
I think I understand why Caine did it.

552
01:10:38,571 --> 01:10:42,074
He thought he had to. He did it
because he thought he had no choice.

553
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:45,244
- Did what?
- I save the man, he takes out a bus stop.

554
01:10:45,369 --> 01:10:48,372
I saved that kid.
I don't know what he's gonna do.

555
01:10:48,498 --> 01:10:53,044
Terrible things happen on the third day
after using the light to save somebody.

556
01:10:53,169 --> 01:10:56,130
- Are you listening to yourself, man?
- No, you listen.

557
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:59,300
Maybe it's Lucifer
or the devil or these ghosts.

558
01:10:59,425 --> 01:11:02,178
Whatever it is, I know I can stop it, Marty,

559
01:11:02,303 --> 01:11:05,014
before anyone else gets hurt.

560
01:11:05,139 --> 01:11:08,476
You know you're my boy, right?
And I love you. I really do.

561
01:11:08,601 --> 01:11:14,190
I'm not gonna stand by and watch you
do this to yourself. I can't. I won't.

562
01:11:14,315 --> 01:11:18,611
We've got a business. I can't do this
by myself, man. We've got things to do.

563
01:11:18,736 --> 01:11:21,155
This is the bus stop.

- (man #2) Other side. Other side.

581
01:13:18,773 --> 01:13:21,400
- Easy.

Go, go, go! Now!
I got him. I got him.

Hold on. Kurt!

Kurt, what's wrong? Kurt!

Kurt!

Tria Mera.

589
01:14:47,236 --> 01:14:49,947
I need you to go downstairs
right away. Call 911.

01:15:19,227 --> 01:15:21,354
Why?

591
01:15:23,147 --> 01:15:25,441
I don't think you should've saved me.

- Kill. Kill.

600
01:19:49,831 --> 01:19:51,958
You made it.

601
01:19:54,794 --> 01:19:58,631
- I've been worried sick about you.
- What for?

602
01:19:58,756 --> 01:20:01,050
I heard what happened at the hotel.

603
01:20:01,175 --> 01:20:04,262
First you save that kid's life, and...

604
01:20:04,387 --> 01:20:06,681
You must feel awful, Abe.

605
01:20:07,557 --> 01:20:10,101
Sherry, I need to talk to you.

606
01:20:11,561 --> 01:20:13,688
About what?

607
01:20:14,438 --> 01:20:18,067
- Outside. I'll tell you outside.
- You can tell me right here.

608
01:20:18,192 --> 01:20:22,655
- I can't explain in front of all these people.
- Why not?

609
01:20:23,573 --> 01:20:27,410
(echoing voices) If save, must kill.

610
01:20:30,538 --> 01:20:33,583
- What is it, Abe?
- (echoing voices) Must kill.

611
01:20:34,917 --> 01:20:38,838
- You have to come with me.
- What are you doing? You're hurting me.

612
01:20:38,963 --> 01:20:41,007
- I have to do this.
- Do what?

613
01:20:41,132 --> 01:20:44,218
Sherry, I shouldn't have saved you.

614
01:20:45,845 --> 01:20:47,638
- Calm down.
- You don't...

615
01:20:47,763 --> 01:20:50,099
- Calm down.
- You don't understand.

616
01:20:50,224 --> 01:20:53,019
- Get away from her.
- It doesn't involve you!

617
01:20:53,144 --> 01:20:56,230
Listen to me. Sherry!

618
01:20:57,148 --> 01:20:59,358
Sherry!

619
01:21:14,332 --> 01:21:16,792
(static and feedback)

620
01:21:22,965 --> 01:21:26,219
(echoing voices) Many will die.
Many will die.

621
01:21:34,602 --> 01:21:38,356
Many will die. Many will die.

622
01:22:33,119 --> 01:22:37,623
No, no, no. Not here. Anywhere but here.

623
01:23:50,238 --> 01:23:54,200
Here's the menu.
I'll be right back to take your order.

624
01:24:56,345 --> 01:25:01,601
The old man who killed all those people,
you saved him.

625
01:25:01,726 --> 01:25:05,354
And the kid from the hotel,
you saved him too.

626
01:25:12,111 --> 01:25:15,156
And then you saved me.

627
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:20,244
I'm so sorry, Sherry.

628
01:25:28,461 --> 01:25:30,963
Don't be.

629
01:25:50,942 --> 01:25:53,361
That man, he has a gun.

630
01:25:53,486 --> 01:25:56,239
Police. Put the gun down.

631
01:25:56,364 --> 01:26:00,952
Listen to him, sir.
No one wants to get hurt, right?

632
01:26:02,453 --> 01:26:05,498
Put it down.

633
01:26:48,207 --> 01:26:51,961
Please, just make it stop.

634
01:26:52,795 --> 01:26:54,797
You...

635
01:26:55,882 --> 01:26:58,217
you have to die.

636
01:27:40,843 --> 01:27:42,678
Ma'am.

637
01:27:43,763 --> 01:27:46,224
Please, leave him.

638
01:28:08,287 --> 01:28:10,665
(echoing voices) If save, must kill.

639
01:28:10,790 --> 01:28:14,043
Kill. Kill. Kill.

640
01:28:16,254 --> 01:28:17,922
I got her.

641
01:28:20,633 --> 01:28:24,178
(echoing voices) Kill. Kill. Kill.

642
01:28:24,303 --> 01:28:27,223
She's going into shock.
Let's get her out of here.

643
01:28:27,348 --> 01:28:29,433
(echoing voices) Kill. Kill.

644
01:28:29,559 --> 01:28:31,602
Come on.

645
01:28:39,610 --> 01:28:41,946
(siren)

646
01:29:11,517 --> 01:29:13,978
(distorted voices echo)

647
01:29:31,162 --> 01:29:33,372
(driver) Shit!

648
01:29:38,044 --> 01:29:41,088
- I've never seen this before.
- Note the time and sedate.

649
01:29:41,214 --> 01:29:43,591
7:29pm.

650
01:29:46,636 --> 01:29:49,680
- 2ccs Versed.
- Shut her up.

651
01:29:51,557 --> 01:29:53,184
What the hell?

652
01:29:55,728 --> 01:29:57,605
Tria Mera.

653
01:30:00,441 --> 01:30:01,442
(screams)

654
01:30:59,625 --> 01:31:00,918
Tommy.

655
01:31:55,014 --> 01:31:57,433
Are you all right? Come here.
