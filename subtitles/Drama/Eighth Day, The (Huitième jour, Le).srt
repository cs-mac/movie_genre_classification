1
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,772
Shall I tell you a secret, Séverine?

2
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,901
I love you more every day.

3
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:24,611
And I you, Pierre.

4
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:27,151
You're all I have, but -

5
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,819
But what?

6
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:34,697
I'd like everything to be perfect too.
If only you weren't so cold.

7
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,823
Please don't mention that again.

8
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,501
I didn't mean to upset you.

9
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,999
I feel a great tenderness for you.

10
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,631
What good is your tenderness to me?

11
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:49,003
You can be very cruel
when you wish.

12
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:52,430
Forgive me, Pierre.

13
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,805
Stop.

14
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,657
Get out.

15
00:03:10,774 --> 00:03:13,573
- What's going on?
- I said get out.

16
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:15,116
But why?

17
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:16,204
Come on.

18
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:19,621
- Let me go!
- Come on!

19
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:24,504
Do what I told you.

20
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:35,557
How dare you!

21
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,472
Let me go!

22
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:40,767
You brutes!

23
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,106
Let go of me!

24
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:48,480
It's not my fault.
I can explain everything.

25
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,068
Go on.

26
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:54,193
Don't worry about roughing up
the little slut! Hurry!

27
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,069
Pierre, it's your fault too.

28
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,489
I can explain everything!

29
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:01,958
Shut your mouth, madame,
or <i>I'll</i> shut it for you!

30
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,252
Stop!

31
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,554
Please tell them to let me go!

32
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,762
Help!

33
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:23,977
Shut up, you little bitch!

34
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,068
Come on.

35
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:34,984
Pull.

36
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,706
Don't scream or I'll kill you,
you hear?

37
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,455
Pierre, I beg you.

38
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,453
I beg your forgiveness

39
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,501
with all my heart.

40
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,523
Pierre, please don't let the cats out!

41
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:26,035
That's enough.
She's yours now.

42
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:28,207
- Pierre, I love you!
- Go ahead.

43
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,514
<i>What are you
thinking about, Séverine?</i>

44
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,978


45
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,859
I was thinking about you... and us.

46
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,359
We were out for a ride in a carriage.

47
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,194
The carriage again?

48
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,532
I want to kiss you.

49
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,544
- You have an early day tomorrow.
- Why?

50
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,918
- To pack our bags.
- We're going somewhere?

51
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,214
- Yes.
- Where?

52
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,971
It's a surprise
for our wedding anniversary.

53
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:24,726
Our happiness has lasted a year already,
“and the suns of yesteryear...”

54
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,220
What about the hospital?

55
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,438
I want to forget about work
for a few days

56
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,478
and think only of you.

57
00:06:36,855 --> 00:06:38,698
Happy?

58
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,488
Especially when you're here.

59
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:43,237
I wish you could be
near me every second.

60
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,795
No, please.

61
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:02,965
Sleep well.

62
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,386
Good night.

63
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,867
Forgive me.

64
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,240
You're so good,
so understanding, but I -

65
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,742
It's all right. Go to sleep.

66
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,384
You coming
to the party at the hotel?

67
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,883
I don't know.
Husson goes to bed at sundown.

68
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:49,637
Then come alone.
They say it's going to snow tonight.

69
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:53,103
I'd love to see the mesmerist.
I hear he's wonderful.

70
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:54,770
I won't let him put me to sleep.

71
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:58,486
A mesmerist isn't a hypnotist.
He makes the sun rise.

72
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,819
A hypnotist plunges you
down into the depths.

73
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,576
Well, see you later.

74
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:18,214
What time is it?

75
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:21,672
Five o'clock. You look bored.
Don't let me keep you.

76
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,670
One's never bored in a bar,

77
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:27,262
unlike in a church,
alone with one's own soul.

78
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,723
I have something nice to tell you.

79
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,013
I love you.

80
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:36,934
Your scars heal so nicely.

81
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,685
Oh, stop it.

82
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,202
Let's not go in.
She's with Husson.

83
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,821
Too late. He saw us.

84
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,825
What have you got against him?
He's an interesting fellow.

85
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,418
I don't like how he looks at me.

86
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,957
Come on.

87
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,181
I saw you two
pass by earlier arm in arm.

88
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:19,185
It was a pleasure to see.
Like newly-weds.

89
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:22,654
- We must have looked ridiculous.
- No, it was very reassuring,

90
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:25,240
like an everyday occurrence.

91
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:29,744
But you, Pierre - you sometimes
make me feel guilty and uneasy.

92
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:32,030
You and I are so different.

93
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:35,159
One really doesn't meet
many men like you.

94
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,827
I mean it sincerely.

95
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:53,268
Another missed opportunity
for punishment.

96
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,762
Why? Do you know them?

97
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,730
Is that all you're interested in?

98
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,350
Everything else is useless.
A lot of wasted time.

99
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:03,775
You should see a specialist
about your obsessions.

100
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:07,399
He's rich and idle.
Those are his two main illnesses.

101
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,276
Don't forget the hunt.

102
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,904
I also have
a special weakness for the poor.

103
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,659
I think of them when it snows,
with no fur coats, no hope. Nothing.

104
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,535
You're very attractive, Séverine.

105
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,958
Your compliments are too subtle,
so just be quiet.

106
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,626
You're asking the impossible.

107
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:26,168
I've been here three hours.
I feel a headache coming on.

108
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,420
It's not too cold outside?
- No, it's nice.

109
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:31,139
I'll get some fresh air before dark.
See you later, Renée.

110
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,475
- See you later.
- Have a nice walk.

111
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,977
I like him. He's amusing.

112
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,892
He's strange.

113
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,731
Worse than that.

114
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,005
- Forgot to ask how Husson is.
- He's fine.

115
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:11,005
- Still together?
- Afraid so. Let's not talk about it.

116
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,299
You remember Henriette?
- Yes, very well.

117
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,927
It seems...

118
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,846
she's turning tricks.

119
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:22,349
- What?
- In one of those houses.

120
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,893
They say she's there
several days a week.

121
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,147
Can you believe it? Henriette!

122
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,775
Of course,
that's all so far from your world.

123
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,699
But can you imagine?
A woman like you or me.

124
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,119
Can you see her
going with just anybody?

125
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,743
In those places
you don't get to choose.

126
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,712
Old or not, lousy-looking or not.

127
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:49,217
Even with a man you love
it can be unpleasant.

128
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:53,259
It must be horrible with a stranger.
Those places still exist?

129
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,224
Excuse me, ladies,

130
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:59,845
but I can assure you:
Those places do still exist.

131
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:03,439
Oh, maybe not like
the joints before the war.

132
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,400
The red lights are gone, of course.

133
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,813
But trust me:
There's no lack of business.

134
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,365
I could show you a good half dozen.

135
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:14,530
Part of my job, you see.

136
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:18,246
In 20 years of driving a cab
I've seen everything.

137
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,033
I've been mugged twice,

138
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,330
and I'm none the worse for it.

139
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,414
Hey, what's the matter?

140
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,083
We're here.

141
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,794
These flowers came for you, madame.

142
00:13:06,953 --> 00:13:08,955
Very well. Who sent them?

143
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:10,874
Mr. Husson.

144
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,467
Why did you put them here?

145
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,487
I'll get a cloth.

146
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,274
It's nothing.
The water was clean.

147
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,180
What's the matter with me today?

148
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,607
Séverine, come quickly!

149
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:17,407
Are you coming or not?

150
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:32,088
- Will you be much longer?
- I'm almost done.

151
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,804
Can I ask you a silly question?

152
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,472
Go ahead.

153
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:55,069
Before you met me,

154
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:58,281
did you use to go
to those... houses a lot?

155
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:00,571
Those houses?

156
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:06,077
Not very often. Why?
Does that interest you?

157
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:08,325
Everything about you interests me.

158
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:12,207
But I thought
they'd been closed down.

159
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,330
They've gone underground.

160
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,634
I can't imagine how it works.

161
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,594
- Listen, I have to work.

162
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:26,385
Well, you go in.
The women are there.

163
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,390
You pick one.

164
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,014
You spend half an hour
alone with her,

165
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:34,143
and after you leave,
you're depressed all day.

166
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:37,862
But what can you do?<i>
Semen retentum venenum est.</i>

167
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:39,481
Be quiet.

168
00:15:40,398 --> 00:15:43,117
I don't want to hear
any more, please.

169
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:45,658
What's the matter?

170
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,790
I've never seen you like this.
What's going on?

171
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,455
Nothing.
I'm just tired and on edge.

172
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,585
Go get some rest.

173
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,209
You're right.

174
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:05,427
- Shall I come with you?

175
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:08,643
Yes, stay with me
until I fall asleep.

176
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:13,265
Will you never grow up?

177
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,037
I can't hit anything today.
Take my place.

178
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:39,006
- You leaving?
- No, <i>I'll</i> wait for you inside.

179
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:51,762
- How are you?
- Not bad.

180
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:54,935
- We don't see much of you these days.
- That's true.

181
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,866
<i>The mysterious Henriette!</i>

182
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:11,243
<i>The woman with two faces.</i>

183
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,117
A double life. How intriguing!

184
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,170
Did Renée tell you?
- Yes. But why?

185
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,373
Simple: for the money.

186
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:25,007
Most women who sell themselves
do so, alas, for the money.

187
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:32,644
It's nice to see you, Séverine.
- I can't understand women like that.

188
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,058
It's the oldest profession
in the world.

189
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:36,894
It's mostly arranged by phone now,

190
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,809
but the women in those houses
are a special breed.

191
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,152
I'm sure you know them well.

192
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,773
Yes, I used to go a lot.
I enjoyed it.

193
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:49,653
There's a very special atmosphere.
The women are complete slaves.

194
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,409
I remember a few around the Opera.

195
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:55,121
Especially one run by Anais.

196
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:58,871
11 , cite' Jean de Saumur.
I have marvellous memories.

197
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,168
- Are you mad?
- It's nothing.

198
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,883
A cute <i>compulsion</i>, as the English say.

199
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,423
An insignificant little impulse.

200
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:08,930
I must see you sometime -

201
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,014
without your husband, of course.

202
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:14,477
I admire Pierre very much,
but I'd prefer he not be there.

203
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:27,156
<i>Madame Anafg
11, cite Jean de Saamuz:</i>

204
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,949
<i>What's the matter with you?</i>

205
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,490
- I wanted to speak to you.
- Come in.

206
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:04,074
Are you in charge of...?

207
00:22:04,198 --> 00:22:05,996
I'm Madame Anais.

208
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,874
I came to see if -

209
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,713
Let's go inside.
We'll be more comfortable there.

210
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,927
Have a seat.
Can I offer you something?

211
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,810
- Cigarette?
- Thank you, I don't smoke.

212
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:28,476
Don't be frightened.
Make yourself at home.

213
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,608
I'll do whatever I can.
Sit down.

214
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:39,033
You're nice, and fresh.
Just what they like here.

215
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:42,244
I know it's hard at first,

216
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:45,240
but who doesn't need money
now and then?

217
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:49,372
We'll split fifty-fifty.

218
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,917
I have my expenses.

219
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,961
Thank you very much,
but I must be going.

220
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:58,628
Come now.
You're just a bit nervous.

221
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,591
I bet it's the first time
you've worked.

222
00:23:03,966 --> 00:23:06,139
It's not really so awful.

223
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:09,598
It's still early.
The other girls aren't here yet.

224
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:11,770
You're about to lose a button.

225
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:14,648
When would you like to start?

226
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,315
I don't know.

227
00:23:16,437 --> 00:23:17,734
Today?

228
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:20,654
Yes, perhaps.
But afternoons only.

229
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:24,074
I have to leave at five, without fail.

230
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,038
All right,

231
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:29,534
but you must be punctual
or I'll be very annoyed.

232
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,669
I promise
you'll be free to go at five.

233
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,797
Good-bye, and excuse me.

234
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,634
I'll expect you this afternoon at two.

235
00:23:57,478 --> 00:23:59,230
What's the matter?
Anything serious?

236
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:01,778
No, I was out shopping

237
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,943
and just suddenly wanted
to see you.

238
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:07,413
- I thought you didn't like hospitals.
- No, I don't.

239
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,791
I don't feel like being alone.
Let me take you out to lunch.

240
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:14,412
I'm having lunch with the manager.
I told you this morning.

241
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,789
- That's true, but -
- I'm sorry.

242
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:20,050
Don't forget we're going out
with the Févrets tonight.

243
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,429
- Sorry to bother you.
- Bother me?

244
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,641
See you tonight.
<i>I'll</i> try to be home early.

245
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,898
I didn't think you'd be back.

246
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,772
You left so abruptly this morning.

247
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,775
I thought I'd scared you off.
Come in.

248
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:31,864
Put your things in here.

249
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:37,206
You'll meet the other two girls soon.

250
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,750
Mathilde and Charlotte.

251
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,874
Both very nice.

252
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,635
I only tolerate
well-bred people here,

253
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,881
and they must be cheerful.

254
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:51,013
I want people to enjoy their work.

255
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:56,146
Just last week I had to let a girl go.
Very beautiful, too.

256
00:25:56,263 --> 00:25:59,517
But she was too vulgar.
It's a shame.

257
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:01,978
Come sit down.

258
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:09,243
What's your name?
- I don't want -

259
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,657
I'm not asking your real name.

260
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:14,870
You think mine is really Anais?

261
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:18,494
We'll have a little something
to celebrate your arrival.

262
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:21,122
- No, thank you.
- I insist.

263
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,499
Cherries in brandy.

264
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:28,087
We need to find you a name -
something simple and smart,

265
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:30,715
and easy to remember.

266
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,217
We can think of one together,
if you like.

267
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:40,851
We call him Mr. Adolphe.
One of our best clients.

268
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,602
You'll see. He's very funny.

269
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,572
I have an idea.

270
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,941
What if we called you
“Belle de jour”?

271
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,737
Since you're only here afternoons.
- If you like.

272
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,374
You look a bit nervous.

273
00:26:59,243 --> 00:27:00,836
Relax.

274
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:03,627
You'll be out by five.
Don't worry.

275
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,335
You have someone waiting for you?

276
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,715
A boyfriend?

277
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,180
A husband?

278
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,054
Oh, don't think I'm prying.

279
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,969
Kiss me.

280
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,982
The girls are thirsty.

281
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:25,561
Wait here. I'll be back.

282
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:39,834
<i>A new girl,
and you're hiding her from me?</i>

283
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:44,254
<i>Bring her in this minute
or H! go get her myself.</i>

284
00:27:57,718 --> 00:28:00,938
He's a funny chap. You'll see.
A sweet manufacturer.

285
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:03,148
He has factories in Bordeaux.

286
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,316
Makes a lot of money.
Come on.

287
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:12,366
Some night if I have to go without,
I can run to make myself sleep.

288
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,528
The other day in Brussels
I had a black girl.

289
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:17,825
What a time we had!

290
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,082
This is Belle de jour.

291
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,415
I told you to close those drapes.

292
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,168
Belle de jour,
my respects as of 2.45.

293
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:33,091
Have some champagne with us.

294
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:35,840
Anais, a bottle of bubbly,
and quick!

295
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:39,639
You're lucky. They always open
a bottle for a new girl.

296
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,013
It sounds like you already had some.

297
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:47,067
Get acquainted.
I'll be right back.

298
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:54,325
A hell of a woman, from head to toe.

299
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,443
Forget it. She's too high-class.

300
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,411
That's exactly why, sweetie!

301
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,073
Listen to him.
He never gets enough.

302
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,833
What a specimen.

303
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,377
This is pretty.

304
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:09,169
But you need something
that comes off in a jiffy. Right?

305
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,293
No, I think she's a knockout
in that little dress.

306
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:15,341
Very refined.
Just how I like them.

307
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:19,057
You promised me a present.
I'd love a dress like that.

308
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,268
I'm not Rothschild, baby!

309
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:22,887
Too bad.

310
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,772
What a great cut!

311
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,684
The detail work is incredible.

312
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:31,312
It's easy to dress well
when you've got money.

313
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,484
But you can't buy class.

314
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,607
Here's the champagne.

315
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,610
My throat was feeling dry.

316
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,584
No, let me do that.
That's a man's job.

317
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:48,921
I'm a world champion cork-popper.

318
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,460
A real virtuoso
from so much practice.

319
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,217
<i>I like ham and sausage</i>

320
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:57,304
<i>I like ham when it's good</i>

321
00:29:57,421 --> 00:30:01,801
<i>But I like even more
a nice pair of thighs</i>

322
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,021
It wasn't cold enough.

323
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:09,062
Champagne over 46 degrees
tastes like tea.

324
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:12,231
Sorry. If I'd known,
I'd have put it in the fridge.

325
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:16,823
- You knew I was coming.
- But not that Belle de jour was.

326
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:21,158
To the person
I care most about - me!

327
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:23,280
And to Belle de jour.

328
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,451
Good, but a little warm.

329
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:32,249
Mathilde, I forgot.
I do have a present for you.

330
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:36,297
Here.
- What is it?

331
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:38,091
Open it and see.

332
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:56,860
He's funny.
He always has some surprise.

333
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:58,899
Here's to fun!

334
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:01,777
I love life.
I like people to have fun.

335
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,202
Well, Belle de jour?

336
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,587
You in a bad mood?

337
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,254
What's the matter?

338
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,591
You'll see.

339
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,474
<i>I'll</i> show you a good time, I promise.

340
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,811
What's with her?

341
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,938
Give me a minute with her.

342
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:40,191
We mustn't rush her.
It's her first time.

343
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:43,615
- I've heard that before.
- It's true, I swear.

344
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:52,249
- Who does she think she is?
- She's just new.

345
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:55,711
You're doing fine.
You're a big hit already.

346
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:59,085
Mr. Adolphe is a simple man,
so don't get upset.

347
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:02,254
Do what he wants.
That's all he asks.

348
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,469
- No, I want to go.
- What?

349
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:08,978
You about done putting on airs?
Where do you think you are?

350
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:10,562
Go on.

351
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,733
Yes, Madam. I'm going.

352
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,898
Leave me alone, you two.

353
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:19,863
Seems you need a firm hand, eh?

354
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:29,323
Go on.

355
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,413
Close the door.

356
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,042
Come here.

357
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:44,596
I sent the others away.
More intimate that way.

358
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:47,057
Now, then...

359
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:50,306
it seems it's your first time?

360
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:55,140
Careful!
I have a nose for these things.

361
00:32:55,265 --> 00:32:57,267
Don't try to fool me.

362
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,946
But if it's true,

363
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,648
there's no need to be ashamed.

364
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:08,662
You're not telling me
you're still a virgin at your age?

365
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,831
But we'll soon find out.

366
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:16,002
What? Do I scare you?

367
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,880
Don't like my face?

368
00:33:19,873 --> 00:33:22,376
Better get used to it,
my little friend.

369
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:29,842
No, you're not running off now.

370
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:33,182
Who do you think you are,
you little slut?

371
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:36,019
You get me excited
and then pull me up short?

372
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:40,228
You can put on airs for a while,
but I've had enough.

373
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:44,068
There.

374
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,865
See?

375
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,323
That's more like it.

376
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:55,208
you need the rough stuff, do you?

377
00:34:01,081 --> 00:34:03,709
Jack of clubs, my gin card.

378
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,678
Mr. Adolphe
is taking a long time.

379
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,301
He always does.

380
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:53,823
Séverine, where are you?
Are you ready?

381
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:58,039
You're in here?

382
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,705
What's the matter?
ls something wrong?

383
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,295
Are you ill?

384
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,710
You don't have a temperature.

385
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:14,385
Shall I send for someone?
- No, it's nothing.

386
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:16,133
I was sleeping.

387
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:18,601
I had a headache.
I don't know why.

388
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:21,851
I took an aspirin and a hot bath.
I'll feel better tomorrow.

389
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,598
What time is it?

390
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,145
It's late.

391
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,644
I'll call the Févrets to cancel.

392
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:30,022
- You go by yourself.
- Absolutely not.

393
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:33,821
I'll be much better here.
Anyway, I have work to do.

394
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:37,404
Get some rest. Good night.

395
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,059
Is the soup ready?

396
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:14,195
It's cold,
and I can't warm it up.

397
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:21,577
Are bulls given names like cats?
- of course.

398
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:24,118
Most of those are called Remorse.

399
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:27,336
Except the last one.
His name is Expiation.

400
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,933
What time is it?

401
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:43,470
Between two and five,
but not later than five.

402
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,723
- How's your wife?

403
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:48,942
- Where is she?
- Right over there.

404
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:51,311
Want to say hello?
- I'd love to.

405
00:37:51,436 --> 00:37:53,279
How are you, little slut?

406
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,819
Everything alright, you tramp?

407
00:37:56,149 --> 00:37:57,617
Old whore!

408
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,119
Maggot!

409
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:00,369
Sodomite!

410
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:01,830
Scum!

411
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,163
Fellatomane!

412
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,659
Trollop! Harlot!

413
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:09,084
Pierre, please stop!
I love you!

414
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,342
Just what do you want?

415
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,633
I wanted -

416
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:19,722
Your job back?

417
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:23,594
So you can disappear again
for a week without a word?

418
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:27,974
I won't have amateurs here.
That's what the streets are for.

419
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:33,399
You're lucky you're dealing with me.

420
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:37,153
Some others would shut
the door in your face.

421
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,994
I'm too soft.

422
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:46,579
But if you come back,
you have to be serious about it.

423
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,915
Can I count on you every day?

424
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,164
Yes, but only until five o'clock.

425
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:54,048
Go on in.

426
00:38:57,735 --> 00:38:59,809
Nice to see you again.

427
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,219
It's Belle de jour.
How are you?

428
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,559
- Fine, thanks.
- You ran out on us.

429
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:07,145
- Why didn't you come back sooner?
- I couldn't.

430
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:09,606
- Give me your coat.

431
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:13,727
It's so nice.
Say, may I ask a favour?

432
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:17,527
Could I borrow it this Sunday?
<i>I'll</i> bring it back Monday.

433
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:20,241
Listen, I hate to say no,

434
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:23,703
but Sunday wouldn't work so well,
because -

435
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,822
Don't worry.
I'm seen it in ready-to-wear.

436
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:28,951
Carducci! Only the best.

437
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,415
Who are you?

438
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,840
Was it tough coming back?

439
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,709
I do this because of my fiancé.

440
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:41,005
He was hurt in a cycling accident
and can't work.

441
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:44,508
He knows I come here.
But I really love him.

442
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:47,302
Of course,
I could make a living elsewhere.

443
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:50,180
- And how much would you make?
- That's true.

444
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:53,396
The Professor
will be here any minute.

445
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:57,654
<i>I'll</i> introduce you.
You're just his type.

446
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:58,896
Who is he?

447
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:01,866
A gynaecologist.
Apparently a big name.

448
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:03,735
With an international clientèle.

449
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:06,659
Did an operation in Copenhagen
just two months ago.

450
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,827
There he is.

451
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:11,413
Fill her in.

452
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:14,621
Time to turn the lights on already.

453
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,385
You'll see, it's easy.
If they were all like him...

454
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:25,932
I have a new girl.
I think you'll like her very much.

455
00:40:26,049 --> 00:40:29,178
A little shy, perhaps,
but a real aristocrat.

456
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:31,304
- Really?
- Would I lie to you?

457
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,682
Very well. Send her in.

458
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:36,150
Go on in, please.

459
00:41:56,973 --> 00:41:59,692
- What are you doing?
- I was -

460
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:02,149
Didn't they tell you?
Get dressed!

461
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,785
Come in.

462
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:21,873
The marquise called?

463
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:29,092
Isn't her Ladyship satisfied
with my services?

464
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,717
no, not really.

465
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,651
- Madame Anais?

466
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:44,146
You belong in the kitchen,
young lady.

467
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,323
She's no good.
Get me Charlotte, quickly!

468
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,067
Right away.

469
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,069
Come along.

470
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,578
Charlotte,
go in to the Professor right away.

471
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,751
<i>Just a second
I'm getting undressed.</i>

472
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:06,088
Go inside.
It's not brain surgery.

473
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,683
Come here.

474
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,273
Watch carefully what Charlotte does,

475
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,437
and don't make a sound.

476
00:43:42,078 --> 00:43:43,421
Come in.

477
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:50,428
- The marquise called?

478
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:52,968
Isn't her Ladyship satisfied
with my services?

479
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:55,467
You're always making mistakes.

480
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,053
It's true, I admit it.

481
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:01,973
But the marquise is so good,

482
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,689
so kind,
and especially so beautiful.

483
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:06,311
Insolent man!

484
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:10,569
Look here.

485
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:13,485
Are you blind? Can't you see?

486
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,494
There's dust everywhere.

487
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:18,406
There, there, and there!

488
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,827
I broke a vase.

489
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:25,288
A vase? Now I've had enough!

490
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:27,507
This time you're fired!

491
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:32,216
No, I beg you, Marquise,
keep me on.

492
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:35,590
Give me another chance.
I'll be very careful, I swear.

493
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:39,178
- Not yet! Give me that.

494
00:44:39,594 --> 00:44:41,972
Her Ladyship can punish me
if she wishes.

495
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:45,767
Let her beat me,
but she mustn't fire me.

496
00:44:45,892 --> 00:44:47,690
What are you doing?
You dirty old man!

497
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:49,820
Nothing.
I'm not doing anything.

498
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:52,156
I keep my distance, alas.

499
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:55,823
I shouldn't tell you this.
It's a secret, Marquise.

500
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:58,367
I love you.

501
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:08,290
I love you, I tell you.

502
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:11,501
Now walk on me.

503
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:13,754
Spit on me. Stomp on my face.

504
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:19,308
Dirty old man! Pig!
I'll teach you!

505
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:22,645
But I love you.

506
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:29,439
Hit me harder!

507
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,321
Come along.
Someone's waiting.

508
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:37,698
Well, did you watch?
What do you think?

509
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:40,534
How can anyone sink so low?

510
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:43,908
You might be used to it,
but it disgusts me.

511
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,417
No, sir, not me!

512
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,969
What about her?

513
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,721
Will she do?

514
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,440
What's that?

515
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:17,609
This is no good here.
Cash only.

516
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,415
All right. Go on.

517
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:03,013
- Did you behave and study hard?

518
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:06,760
Say hello to your godmother
and show her your grades.

519
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:10,601
Hello, Cathy. How are you?

520
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:12,811
Show me your report card.

521
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:17,236
No hello for me?

522
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:24,201
Shall we go to the fair on Sunday?
Happy now?

523
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:28,243
A seven in history,
and a nine in speech. Good.

524
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:32,081
Madame Anais!

525
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:34,586
What?

526
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,043
The Professor wants an inkwell.

527
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:40,084
- What's going on?
- He wants an inkwell.

528
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:41,927
An inkwell?

529
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,588
As if I'd have one!

530
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:11,366
- Go upstairs and do your homework.

531
00:49:39,852 --> 00:49:42,355
That man would scare me too.

532
00:49:43,272 --> 00:49:45,866
It must be hard sometimes.

533
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,158
What would you know, Pallas?

534
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:38,202
May I, miss?

535
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:45,797
- Miss or Mrs.?
- Miss.

536
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:47,670
Perfect.

537
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:50,590
What's your name?

538
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:51,931
Belle de jour.

539
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,801
Charming.

540
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:57,521
I once had a cat
named Dark Beauty.

541
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:01,354
Do you come here often?

542
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:04,019
Every day in my thoughts.

543
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,653
Lovely morning, isn't it?

544
00:51:08,941 --> 00:51:10,614
It really is.

545
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:14,280
Nothing I like more
than the autumn sun.

546
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,411
The black sun.

547
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:19,414
Black sun?

548
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:21,579
I think you're very elegant.

549
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,130
Thank you.

550
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:25,424
Do you like money?

551
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:31,301
I'd give you a lot
to come to my house.

552
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:35,768
- Your house?
- For a sort of religious ceremony.

553
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:39,605
A very moving one
that means a lot to me.

554
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,808
What can I say?
I'm from another era,

555
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,686
when people still had
a feeling for death.

556
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:50,650
If you'd accept,
I'd be a very happy man.

557
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:53,698
You're just the girl I'm looking for.

558
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:56,614
I live an hour from Paris.

559
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:58,457
Here's my card.

560
00:51:59,742 --> 00:52:01,744
I'll meet you at the station.

561
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:43,794
Put this on, please.

562
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:45,754
What's this all about?

563
00:52:46,622 --> 00:52:49,296
You needn't be afraid.

564
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:53,842
All the girls before you
would love to come back,

565
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:57,175
but the duke is very strict
on that point.

566
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:04,139
If you'd kindly follow me.

567
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:10,650
This way.

568
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:54,694
I brought you some lilies.

569
00:53:55,566 --> 00:53:57,409
You loved them so.

570
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,070
How beautiful you are.

571
00:54:00,988 --> 00:54:03,207
Your skin is even fairer.

572
00:54:04,742 --> 00:54:06,915
Your hair is even softer.

573
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:21,800
My beloved daughter.

574
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:29,600
Your face is cold.

575
00:54:31,477 --> 00:54:34,731
Remember how we played
together only yesterday?

576
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:37,316
We laughed and sang.

577
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:44,457
Now you lie there,
mute and motionless.

578
00:54:46,492 --> 00:54:48,494
I hope you've forgiven me.

579
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:51,755
It wasn't my fault.
I loved you too much.

580
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:55,342
Duke, shall I let the cats in?

581
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:57,803
To hell with you and your cats!

582
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:04,347
We're alone.

583
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,138
The doors are closed.

584
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:16,275
Now...

585
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:19,403
your eyes will never open again.

586
00:55:20,526 --> 00:55:22,699
Your limbs are stiff...

587
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,449
worms are eating your heart...

588
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:32,295
and this heady fragrance
of dead flowers...

589
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:38,044
this heady fragrance
of dead flowers...

590
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:10,910
You're still here?
What are you waiting for?

591
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:12,957
It's raining!

592
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:18,379
Get the hell out of here!

593
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:20,089
Out!

594
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,861
Are you almost done?

595
00:56:45,986 --> 00:56:47,488
Coming.

596
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:02,586
Shall I get in with you?

597
00:57:14,723 --> 00:57:18,694
I only wish you'd do this more often,
of your own free will.

598
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:21,821
I will, Pierre.
Just give me time.

599
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:25,443
I always feel like I'm forcing you.

600
00:57:25,776 --> 00:57:27,494
You mustn't think that.

601
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:30,782
I want to be alone with you
more every day.

602
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:32,916
You don't frighten me anymore.

603
00:57:33,033 --> 00:57:35,752
I feel like I understand you better,

604
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:37,917
like I'm getting closer to you.

605
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:41,003
I love you more every day,
you know.

606
00:57:52,919 --> 00:57:55,343
ls the lady of the house in?

607
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,976
- Who should I say is calling?

608
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:04,652
Mr. Husson is here to see you.

609
00:58:05,357 --> 00:58:07,200
Tell him I'm not in.

610
00:58:30,716 --> 00:58:32,844
You're very attractive, Séverine.

611
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:37,849
Frankly, I'd like to write you a letter.
- I'd like that.

612
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:40,350
Would you let me?

613
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:44,696
There are so many people around.
- All the better.

614
00:58:44,813 --> 00:58:47,066
<i>I'll</i> have to give you a receipt.

615
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:49,033
I'm counting on it.

616
00:58:52,154 --> 00:58:54,202
- With this?

617
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:03,548
What are they doing?

618
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,339
Nothing. Just having fun.

619
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:07,928
Take a look.

620
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:09,888
No, just tell me.

621
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:13,592
- He's taking out an envelope.
- And?

622
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:17,270
It's a packet of lily seeds!

623
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:20,558
I see.

624
01:00:14,653 --> 01:00:16,997
- What floor?
- Fourth, please.

625
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:21,955
Excuse me.

626
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:24,334
What are you doing?

627
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,963
Don't do anything stupid.
You're mad.

628
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:35,598
Hurry up. Quick!

629
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:29,861
Well, well... Hippolyte.

630
01:01:29,978 --> 01:01:32,572
Hello, Anai's. Can we come in?

631
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:34,858
Of course.

632
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:42,866
That way.

633
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:55,257
<i>- It's Hippolyte.
- The Spaniard?</i>

634
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,551
I hoped we'd gotten rid of him.

635
01:01:57,964 --> 01:02:00,183
He's with a fellow
I don't recognise.

636
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:01,552
Who's Hippolyte?

637
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:04,471
Wait and see.
An odd sort of chap.

638
01:02:05,347 --> 01:02:07,224
When he has money,
he throws it around.

639
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:10,064
And when he's broke,
he wants it for free.

640
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:13,355
Come on, girls.
All three of you.

641
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:24,624
- How's the little girl?

642
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:26,709
Big enough to be tickled yet?

643
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:29,500
I don't know.
She has to finish school.

644
01:02:36,962 --> 01:02:39,260
- Only the best.

645
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:44,056
 Buen ganao.
- What's that mean?

646
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:46,850
How are things?

647
01:02:46,972 --> 01:02:49,395
- Fine, and you?
- Getting by.

648
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,022
We haven't seen you in months.

649
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,608
- We've missed you a lot.
- Really?

650
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:55,943
Where have you been?

651
01:02:56,064 --> 01:02:59,113
Travelling, in New York...

652
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:01,741
business.

653
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:05,374
Put three bottles on ice.
The good stuff.

654
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:07,284
My best.

655
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,586
From Paris straight to heaven...

656
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:18,045
What I miss most abroad
is French champagne...

657
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:20,926
and sexy girls like you.

658
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:25,599
I brought a friend along.

659
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:28,851
Be sure you treat him well.

660
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:30,940
Of course, Mr. Hippolyte.

661
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:35,524
When we're alone,
I have a new joke for you.

662
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:38,694
You'll love it.
- Keep it to yourself, honey.

663
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:41,318
- Your loss.
- Cow.

664
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:43,992
Get off. You're too heavy.

665
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:47,907
And you're scratching me.
Beat it.

666
01:03:50,035 --> 01:03:52,538
Come here, new girl.

667
01:03:54,998 --> 01:03:56,921
Now...

668
01:03:59,002 --> 01:04:00,675
Let me have her.

669
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:09,183
Take her if you want
and have fun, kid.

670
01:04:09,304 --> 01:04:11,272
You should at your age.

671
01:04:19,981 --> 01:04:24,202
I'd slit my father's throat for less,
but friendship comes first.

672
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:27,914
We're not going fight
over some slut.

673
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:34,750
Your friend seems shy.

674
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,714
Shy isn't the word.

675
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:40,044
The champagne's cold.
Anyone thirsty?

676
01:04:44,464 --> 01:04:45,841
What's your name?

677
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:47,467
Belle de jour.

678
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:49,261
What else?

679
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:50,849
That's it.

680
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:52,643
Don't trust me?

681
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:55,058
I want to know your name.

682
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:58,236
- Belle de jour.
- Why? Aren't you here at night?

683
01:04:58,395 --> 01:05:00,238
What do you do then?

684
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:03,358
Nice boots.

685
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:10,824
Your teeth...

686
01:05:11,074 --> 01:05:12,542
What happened?

687
01:05:13,034 --> 01:05:15,036
Knocked out in one blow.

688
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:18,756
You mind?

689
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:21,585
Then get to it. I'm in a hurry.

690
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:28,929
How old are you?
- Twenty-three.

691
01:05:29,801 --> 01:05:33,101
- Got anyone protecting you?
- What's that mean?

692
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:35,357
Are you free or what?

693
01:05:36,141 --> 01:05:38,769
You making money?
ls business good?

694
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:42,648
- Yes, but -
- Don't lie. It's not nice.

695
01:05:43,106 --> 01:05:45,108
No, leave your stockings on.

696
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:48,369
A girl tried to strangle me once.

697
01:05:48,987 --> 01:05:50,489
Poor thing.

698
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:52,411
If you like, I won't charge you.

699
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:55,494
Naturally.

700
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:58,622
Plenty of girls
would love to be in your place.

701
01:05:59,539 --> 01:06:01,758
Still won't tell me your name?

702
01:06:02,667 --> 01:06:04,669
You're not much of a talker.

703
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:08,640
Fine with me.
Girls that talk are a pain.

704
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:10,804
Not bad.

705
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:15,347
Too bad you've only got two.

706
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:16,974
Let's have a look.

707
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:18,604
Turn over.

708
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:23,442
What's that little brown spot?

709
01:06:23,605 --> 01:06:24,902
A birthmark.

710
01:06:25,464 --> 01:06:27,166
I can't stand those!

711
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:29,577
Get dressed.

712
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:36,080
Not cold enough, as usual.

713
01:06:36,201 --> 01:06:38,795
- You read English now?
- Me? Not at all.

714
01:06:38,912 --> 01:06:40,255
Then what's this?

715
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:41,839
What's it to you?

716
01:06:45,752 --> 01:06:47,174
Enough!

717
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:50,306
Take this to the room.
<i>I'll</i> be right there.

718
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,683
The other one's for Marcel.

719
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:56,763
Who is your friend?

720
01:06:56,888 --> 01:07:00,358
He saved my life last year.
I love him like a son.

721
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:03,487
Think I'd let him have
the blond otherwise?

722
01:07:03,603 --> 01:07:05,901
What's her story?
- Belle de jour?

723
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:08,616
Yes. ls she in demand?

724
01:07:09,067 --> 01:07:12,867
She's the one they come for.
She's got class, and -

725
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,622
And what?

726
01:07:14,906 --> 01:07:17,329
- She's a pearl.
- A pearl?

727
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:26,463
I thought you were going to leave.

728
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:28,594
I'm glad I stayed.

729
01:07:28,711 --> 01:07:31,885
I don? mind telling you: I like you.

730
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:35,806
Look at my hand.

731
01:07:35,927 --> 01:07:37,770
I'm still trembling.

732
01:07:41,516 --> 01:07:43,063
What's this?

733
01:07:43,935 --> 01:07:46,063
- A scar.
- From a knife?

734
01:07:46,396 --> 01:07:47,739
Maybe.

735
01:07:48,648 --> 01:07:50,321
What are you doing here?

736
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:52,114
Don't ask questions.

737
01:07:52,986 --> 01:07:55,830
I'd like to keep you till tonight,
but I can't.

738
01:07:56,197 --> 01:07:58,165
I like you too, Marcel.

739
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:01,244
Will you come back?
- Maybe.

740
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:03,421
If you don't have money -

741
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:06,925
Money isn't a problem.

742
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:09,507
You frighten me.

743
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:39,783
See? You're bored.

744
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:43,419
I'm not.
I'd just like to get back to Paris.

745
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:46,172
You can tell me absolutely anything,

746
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:48,212
but you're hiding something.

747
01:08:49,709 --> 01:08:53,009
If you tell me what's bothering you,
Perhaps I can help.

748
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:54,756
Tell you what?

749
01:08:55,506 --> 01:08:57,304
That you love someone.

750
01:08:57,425 --> 01:08:59,519
- Someone besides you?

751
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:01,934
You know that's impossible.

752
01:09:02,889 --> 01:09:07,360
I suggested this little vacation to see
if anything was tying you to Paris.

753
01:09:07,602 --> 01:09:09,821
I was right.
You want to go back.

754
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:14,326
You're always so distant.

755
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:17,737
I've never felt you
really close to me.

756
01:09:17,862 --> 01:09:19,660
I'm sorry.

757
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:22,288
I suppose it's my fault.

758
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:24,790
Does that prove I don't love you?

759
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:26,754
I think so.

760
01:09:32,126 --> 01:09:34,174
<i>I don 't know how to explain.</i>

761
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:38,345
<i>There's so much I wish
I understood myself, darling.</i>

762
01:09:38,466 --> 01:09:40,343
<i>Things about myself.</i>

763
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:43,305
<i>What I feel for you
isn't about pleasure.</i>

764
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:45,181
<i>It? so much more than that'.</i>

765
01:09:45,306 --> 01:09:49,527
<i>I don? expect you to believe me,
but I've never felt so close to you.</i>

766
01:09:50,269 --> 01:09:51,942
You want to go home?

767
01:09:52,063 --> 01:09:54,191
I'm telling you, I'm not bored.

768
01:09:54,357 --> 01:09:56,451
We can stay another week
if you'd like.

769
01:09:56,567 --> 01:10:00,367
No, we'll leave tomorrow.
I have to get back anyway.

770
01:10:19,006 --> 01:10:20,303
Something wrong, Mr. Marcel?

771
01:10:20,425 --> 01:10:23,554
<i>I've seen men bitten by the bug,
but never like you.</i>

772
01:10:23,678 --> 01:10:25,055
<i>Ah, shut up, will you?</i>

773
01:10:25,179 --> 01:10:28,228
<i>You behaved like an idiot,
not like a man.</i>

774
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:39,531
We waited for you on Thursday.

775
01:10:40,111 --> 01:10:43,240
- So?
- So next time we won't wait.

776
01:10:43,614 --> 01:10:46,618
- We almost didn't come today either.

777
01:10:47,118 --> 01:10:49,041
Your cut keeps going up.

778
01:10:49,162 --> 01:10:51,506
We're getting sick of you
and your little thug.

779
01:10:52,123 --> 01:10:55,502
Don't fight with these hoodlums.
Settle down.

780
01:10:55,626 --> 01:10:59,551
Gentlemen, if you have
something to settle, go outside.

781
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:01,720
Shut your trap, you.

782
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:05,766
The snow.
We know you've got it.

783
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:14,399
Now don't let us keep you.

784
01:11:17,148 --> 01:11:19,822
We'll discuss that “thug” remark
some other time.

785
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:21,535
As you like.

786
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,813
Pierrot, another bottle.

787
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:05,784
- Where you going?
- To make a call.

788
01:12:05,905 --> 01:12:07,327
Again?

789
01:12:11,118 --> 01:12:13,792
Birds... what a curse!

790
01:12:13,913 --> 01:12:17,383
You can say that again.
He's got it bad.

791
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:19,594
It's cost him dearly before.

792
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:23,214
But it's always been his weakness.
Nothing I can do.

793
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:26,350
Anais? It's Marcel.

794
01:12:26,843 --> 01:12:28,390
Any news?

795
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:31,518
When?

796
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:33,350
Really?

797
01:12:35,393 --> 01:12:37,145
I'll be right there.

798
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,990
“Carried his father on his back.”
Six letters.

799
01:12:48,865 --> 01:12:51,163
The third letter's an N.

800
01:12:51,993 --> 01:12:54,746
“Aeneas,” with A-E at the start.

801
01:12:54,871 --> 01:12:58,341
Ah, right.
That comes up a lot in crosswords.

802
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:03,213
Belle, it's him again.
He's waiting.

803
01:13:15,473 --> 01:13:17,526
How are you?

804
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:26,069
Where were you?
Why did you go away?

805
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:29,827
I had to leave Paris for a few days.
I can explain.

806
01:13:29,947 --> 01:13:33,952
I'll explain a few things too,
and I'll leave my signature as well.

807
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,968
Don't touch my face.

808
01:13:44,587 --> 01:13:46,260
Don't touch me!

809
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:49,933
Do that once more
and you'll never see me again.

810
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:54,813
Very well... this time.

811
01:14:20,206 --> 01:14:22,129
I missed you, you know.

812
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:26,091
I shouldn't tell you this,
but I waited for you.

813
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:30,008
I want to see you more often now.
At night too.

814
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:32,635
I'm here every day.
Isn't that enough?

815
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:35,851
You know I'm not free.
- I don't give a damn.

816
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:51,283
I don't get it.

817
01:14:52,363 --> 01:14:54,365
You seem to like being with me.

818
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,083
Very much...

819
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,168
but it's not enough.

820
01:14:58,327 --> 01:15:00,329
You love the other fellow?

821
01:15:01,831 --> 01:15:03,708
Then why are you here?

822
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:05,335
I don't know.

823
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:07,507
They're two different things.

824
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:34,196
I'm starving.
Where should we eat?

825
01:15:34,321 --> 01:15:36,369
No idea.
We'll decide on the way.

826
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:39,118
I'll be back at three.

827
01:15:40,578 --> 01:15:43,172
You've changed so much.
I hardly recognise you.

828
01:15:43,289 --> 01:15:46,668
It's so nice to see you smile.
- I do feel much better.

829
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:49,511
I've never seen you like this.
If only -

830
01:15:49,628 --> 01:15:50,675
What?

831
01:15:50,796 --> 01:15:54,141
If only one day you had
some great news for me.

832
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:56,932
- What do you mean?
- You know very well.

833
01:15:57,053 --> 01:15:59,772
What I want
more than anything: a child.

834
01:16:15,821 --> 01:16:18,165
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

835
01:16:19,325 --> 01:16:22,875
This old thing caught my eye.
I don't know why. It's strange.

836
01:16:22,995 --> 01:16:26,215
- Nothing strange about it.
- No, you're right.

837
01:16:34,173 --> 01:16:37,427
You're back!
I didn't recognise you.

838
01:16:37,551 --> 01:16:41,601
Did you forget about us,
you ungrateful devil? It's been ages.

839
01:16:42,056 --> 01:16:44,229
But you haven't changed.

840
01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:46,276
First door on the right.

841
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:53,781
Come on, girls.
An old friend is back.

842
01:16:54,693 --> 01:16:58,618
Well? Let's go.

843
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:06,038
Yes, yes, you look lovely.

844
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:11,799
- You 're flattering me.
- No, sir, I remember you well.

845
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:14,965
I even dream about you sometimes.

846
01:17:16,090 --> 01:17:18,058
I don't like the sound of that.

847
01:17:18,175 --> 01:17:21,850
- No, I couldn't.
- I insist. Do me the pleasure.

848
01:17:25,683 --> 01:17:28,277
Hello, ladies. Sit down.

849
01:17:32,106 --> 01:17:35,155
Belle de jour? That's original.

850
01:17:36,694 --> 01:17:38,822
Perhaps you'd like some refreshment.

851
01:17:39,321 --> 01:17:41,164
Later.

852
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:44,122
Nothing's changed here.

853
01:17:44,243 --> 01:17:46,746
Still the same homely welcome...

854
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:49,169
the same drapes.

855
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:53,594
Whatever happened to that girl,
the lion tamer?

856
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:56,677
I haven't heard from her.

857
01:17:56,797 --> 01:18:00,597
- And the heat's up all the way?
- You haven't changed either.

858
01:18:00,718 --> 01:18:02,846
Look, that armchair.

859
01:18:05,014 --> 01:18:06,516
It was snowing...

860
01:18:07,308 --> 01:18:09,527
The same special fragrance
in the air.

861
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:11,437
Still jasmine.

862
01:18:12,062 --> 01:18:14,565
I hope you have some time for us.

863
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:17,193
All my life.
I'm a man of leisure.

864
01:18:18,194 --> 01:18:19,491
Now, then...

865
01:18:19,612 --> 01:18:21,990
I'd like to be alone with Belle de jour.

866
01:18:27,828 --> 01:18:29,796
No, I won't!

867
01:18:29,914 --> 01:18:32,884
Is this any way to behave?
You'll stay.

868
01:18:36,045 --> 01:18:37,888
She's very sweet.

869
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:41,217
Just a little on edge sometimes.

870
01:18:44,887 --> 01:18:46,389
Happy now?

871
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:49,517
Don't tell me it's coincidence.
You knew I was here.

872
01:18:49,642 --> 01:18:51,144
You're wrong.

873
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:54,063
It's your fault.
You gave me this address.

874
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:57,529
- You're wrong.
- Come closer and I'll scream.

875
01:18:57,650 --> 01:18:59,573
I'll jump out the window!

876
01:19:05,866 --> 01:19:07,118
Is this your bed?

877
01:19:07,243 --> 01:19:09,120
You disgust me.
I already told you that.

878
01:19:09,245 --> 01:19:12,374
Yes, it's my bed.
What else do you want to know?

879
01:19:13,457 --> 01:19:15,425
You like being humiliated.

880
01:19:15,542 --> 01:19:17,089
I don't.

881
01:19:18,504 --> 01:19:20,222
Don't tell Pierre.

882
01:19:21,739 --> 01:19:24,234
I admire him more and more.

883
01:19:25,302 --> 01:19:27,350
Please don't tell him.

884
01:19:27,888 --> 01:19:30,141
At least try to understand.

885
01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:32,234
I'm lost.

886
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:35,821
I can't help it. I can't fight it.

887
01:19:36,772 --> 01:19:40,072
I know I'll have to atone
for everything one day.

888
01:19:40,693 --> 01:19:42,787
But I couldn't live without it.

889
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:47,124
Fine. Do as you like with me.

890
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:50,919
No. Not now, anyway.

891
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:55,416
I guess what attracted me
about you was your virtue.

892
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:57,635
You were the wife of a boy scout.

893
01:19:57,751 --> 01:19:59,753
That's all changed now.

894
01:19:59,878 --> 01:20:02,222
I have principles, unlike you.

895
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:05,138
I won't tell Pierre, of course.

896
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:10,473
But I have friends I could tell.
I could send you some business.

897
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:13,646
Sorry I don't feel like it.

898
01:20:13,767 --> 01:20:15,769
It really doesn't appeal at all.

899
01:20:16,895 --> 01:20:18,897
Another time, perhaps.

900
01:20:19,148 --> 01:20:20,650
Who knows?

901
01:20:20,774 --> 01:20:22,776
I won't take up your time.

902
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:33,625
This isn't for you.
Get Pierre some chocolates for me.

903
01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:25,218
Ready? Go!

904
01:21:30,386 --> 01:21:31,888
Prepare!

905
01:21:32,388 --> 01:21:33,389
Fire!

906
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:14,601
- He left already?

907
01:22:15,264 --> 01:22:16,982
May I speak with you?

908
01:22:18,267 --> 01:22:19,735
Run along.

909
01:22:27,151 --> 01:22:29,074
- I have to leave.
- When?

910
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:30,491
Now.

911
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:32,990
- But you'll be back?
- Definitely not.

912
01:22:33,115 --> 01:22:34,617
Why?

913
01:22:35,159 --> 01:22:37,412
You could have told me sooner.

914
01:22:37,536 --> 01:22:41,416
Aren't you happy here?
- Yes, fine. It's just -

915
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:43,133
Now I get it.

916
01:22:44,877 --> 01:22:46,379
It's Marcel.

917
01:22:47,379 --> 01:22:49,507
He was just here.
He was furious.

918
01:22:49,715 --> 01:22:51,968
Almost barged into your room.

919
01:22:52,676 --> 01:22:54,974
There's something odd there.

920
01:22:56,096 --> 01:22:57,939
Has he demanding?

921
01:22:58,056 --> 01:23:02,482
Wants you to be his alone,
day and night?

922
01:23:05,814 --> 01:23:07,942
It's always the same story with men.

923
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:11,654
You're right. You'd better go.

924
01:23:12,446 --> 01:23:15,040
There could be trouble one day.

925
01:23:16,116 --> 01:23:17,868
But I'll miss you.

926
01:23:18,744 --> 01:23:20,496
Women like you...

927
01:23:21,497 --> 01:23:23,374
You and I got along well.

928
01:23:23,749 --> 01:23:25,092
It's true.

929
01:23:25,209 --> 01:23:29,055
Let me know how you're doing.
Call once in a while.

930
01:23:29,338 --> 01:23:31,011
I'd like that-.

931
01:23:31,173 --> 01:23:33,221
Is there some address -

932
01:23:34,718 --> 01:23:37,016
Too bad.
What else can I say?

933
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:50,086
Madame,
there's a gentleman to see you.

934
01:24:52,129 --> 01:24:53,472
Who is it?
Do you know him?

935
01:24:53,589 --> 01:24:56,468
No, but he says it's urgent.

936
01:25:06,018 --> 01:25:08,521
- Did you bring the catalogue?

937
01:25:08,645 --> 01:25:10,943
Sit down.

938
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:15,114
Not bad, the catalogue thing.

939
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:19,448
I like your little pad.

940
01:25:19,573 --> 01:25:21,871
What are you doing here?
You're mad! Go away!

941
01:25:21,992 --> 01:25:25,997
Since you weren't at Anais' anymore,
I thought I'd pay you a visit,

942
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:27,998
see how you're doing.

943
01:25:28,874 --> 01:25:31,297
- How did you find me?
- Child's play.

944
01:25:31,793 --> 01:25:33,636
Is this your husband?

945
01:25:33,795 --> 01:25:36,594
Good-looking.
A nice fellow.

946
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:38,722
A lot better than me.

947
01:25:38,842 --> 01:25:41,061
- Please leave.
- Don't worry.

948
01:25:41,178 --> 01:25:43,180
I won't make a scene.

949
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:46,058
I just want to know why you left.

950
01:25:46,183 --> 01:25:49,483
You hear me?
- Be quiet. The maid will hear.

951
01:25:49,686 --> 01:25:51,688
Go away. He'll be home soon.

952
01:25:52,481 --> 01:25:55,109
I just got here
and you want me to leave?

953
01:25:55,233 --> 01:25:57,110
- What do you want?
- To see you again.

954
01:25:57,235 --> 01:26:00,114
Impossible.
I'm never going back there.

955
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,162
I'll give you three days.

956
01:26:07,287 --> 01:26:09,255
Find some excuse.

957
01:26:09,498 --> 01:26:12,843
I'll be waiting at the Hétel Du Bois
on rue Fromentin.

958
01:26:13,043 --> 01:26:16,343
You'll spend the night with me.
- Impossible.

959
01:26:21,343 --> 01:26:23,892
Very well. I'll wait for him.

960
01:26:26,306 --> 01:26:28,684
I have a lot to tell him.
- You wouldn't dare.

961
01:26:28,809 --> 01:26:30,186
Yes, I would.

962
01:26:30,352 --> 01:26:33,856
I didn't want it to come to this,
but since you're forcing me -

963
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:36,241
I guess it's just as well.

964
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:39,737
I'd decided to tell him anyway.
- Really?

965
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:42,034
He'd have found out
sooner or later.

966
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:44,541
One of our friends
discovered I was there.

967
01:26:44,741 --> 01:26:47,085
I want to get it all off my chest.

968
01:26:48,829 --> 01:26:51,173
Fine. We'll both wait for him

969
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:55,135
and tell him together.
I don't mind.

970
01:27:04,511 --> 01:27:07,981
I'm begging you: Leave!
He'll be home soon.

971
01:27:21,403 --> 01:27:22,905
Don't worry.

972
01:27:23,655 --> 01:27:25,282
I'll leave.

973
01:27:26,199 --> 01:27:29,203
I didn't believe you,
but I'm starting to understand.

974
01:27:33,915 --> 01:27:35,917
Here's the obstacle.

975
01:27:44,509 --> 01:27:47,262
See you soon...

976
01:28:23,173 --> 01:28:26,302
- Did you see her?
- Let me have the car.

977
01:28:26,676 --> 01:28:28,895
- Where are you going?
- I need it.

978
01:28:29,471 --> 01:28:31,974
Let me have the car, and beat it.

979
01:28:32,432 --> 01:28:34,480
What are you up to now?

980
01:28:35,727 --> 01:28:37,400
I said beat it.

981
01:28:38,104 --> 01:28:41,654
This time you've seen
the last of me, kid.

982
01:30:05,817 --> 01:30:08,661
Oh no, you don't.
You're not running off.

983
01:30:58,954 --> 01:30:59,955
Any news?

984
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:02,424
The killer's dead,
and the police are baffled.

985
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:05,134
Either he shot the wrong man
or he was insane.

986
01:31:05,251 --> 01:31:07,299
- Has he been identified?
- Yes, a common crook.

987
01:31:07,462 --> 01:31:10,306
It wasn't his first murder.
- Strange.

988
01:31:10,465 --> 01:31:12,809
- How is Sérizy?
- Too early to say.

989
01:31:12,926 --> 01:31:14,928
His wife's in the waiting room.

990
01:31:36,408 --> 01:31:37,876
How is he?

991
01:31:37,993 --> 01:31:41,338
It's too early to say,
but he'll live, so try to relax.

992
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:44,500
- Can I see him?
- No, he's still in a coma.

993
01:31:44,624 --> 01:31:45,876
Perhaps tomorrow.

994
01:31:46,001 --> 01:31:49,346
You should go home and try to rest.

995
01:31:49,504 --> 01:31:52,633
We'll give you an hourly report,
I promise.

996
01:31:54,426 --> 01:31:56,019
Don't worry.

997
01:32:00,098 --> 01:32:02,396
Come on. I'll see you home.

998
01:33:11,086 --> 01:33:13,305
I sent Maria for the newspapers.

999
01:33:13,755 --> 01:33:16,804
I know the articles you like.
I'll read them to you.

1000
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:22,390
Maria's very nice,
and she's so fond of you.

1001
01:33:25,767 --> 01:33:27,815
Everyone's asking about you.

1002
01:33:30,271 --> 01:33:33,901
You're getting better, you know.
The doctor's very optimistic.

1003
01:33:34,818 --> 01:33:37,742
You don't realise it,
but you've made great progress.

1004
01:33:37,862 --> 01:33:39,660
Your eyes especially.

1005
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:43,543
It's funny.
Ever since you were -

1006
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:47,164
Ever since your accident,
my dreams have stopped.

1007
01:33:48,873 --> 01:33:51,717
I think it's time for your drops.

1008
01:34:18,319 --> 01:34:21,539
Mr. Husson, madame.
He'd like to see your husband.

1009
01:34:27,287 --> 01:34:28,789
I'm coming.

1010
01:34:41,593 --> 01:34:43,516
I'm sorry to bother you.

1011
01:34:43,845 --> 01:34:45,688
You want to see Pierre?

1012
01:34:45,805 --> 01:34:47,478
Just for a moment.

1013
01:34:47,932 --> 01:34:50,526
You know, he still can't speak.

1014
01:34:50,977 --> 01:34:52,650
I know.

1015
01:34:52,770 --> 01:34:54,693
I'm sorry I couldn't come sooner.

1016
01:34:54,814 --> 01:34:57,693
You know how I admire Pierre,
but I was out of town.

1017
01:34:58,109 --> 01:34:59,986
Pretty dress.

1018
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:03,619
You look like
a precocious schoolgirl.

1019
01:35:05,241 --> 01:35:08,245
- What do you want to tell Pierre?
- Everything I know about you.

1020
01:35:08,369 --> 01:35:09,461
What?

1021
01:35:09,579 --> 01:35:11,126
Calm down.

1022
01:35:12,248 --> 01:35:16,344
He's paralysed now,
completely dependent on you.

1023
01:35:18,213 --> 01:35:21,717
He's ashamed of being a burden
on such a virtuous wife,

1024
01:35:21,841 --> 01:35:24,845
so I've decided
to tell him everything.

1025
01:35:25,678 --> 01:35:29,057
He'll be hurt, but I think
I'll be doing him a favour.

1026
01:35:31,684 --> 01:35:34,528
Who could call me cruel after that?

1027
01:35:37,398 --> 01:35:39,150
Take me to him, please.

1028
01:35:41,778 --> 01:35:43,280
He's in there.

1029
01:35:48,868 --> 01:35:51,872
Would you like to be present
for our conversation?

1030
01:38:20,103 --> 01:38:22,526
What are you
thinking about, Séverine?

1031
01:38:24,148 --> 01:38:26,401
I was thinking about you.

1032
01:38:26,776 --> 01:38:28,278
I'm thirsty.

1033
01:38:47,755 --> 01:38:50,975
- Shall I ask for some ice?
- No, don't bother.

1034
01:38:52,885 --> 01:38:55,764
I can get two weeks off
this February.

1035
01:38:55,888 --> 01:38:58,391
- Shall we go to the mountains?
- If you'd like.

1036
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:12,997
Do you hear that?
