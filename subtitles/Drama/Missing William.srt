1
00:00:06,957 --> 00:00:11,328
The death of the unknown
singer named Shin Jae Hyun...

2
00:00:11,862 --> 00:00:14,398
has been known as suicide,
but it was actually...

3
00:00:14,998 --> 00:00:16,767
homicide staged as suicide.

4
00:00:17,467 --> 00:00:20,070
Who knew you'd end up helping
me out so much in the end?

5
00:00:21,238 --> 00:00:24,141
Let's toughen up and do this in one go.

6
00:00:25,008 --> 00:00:26,476
Wait. Please...

7
00:00:27,577 --> 00:00:30,247
Please... Please don't kill me.

8
00:00:30,914 --> 00:00:32,949
Please don't kill me.

9
00:00:34,551 --> 00:00:35,719
Let's do this in one go.

10
00:00:37,721 --> 00:00:38,789
This can't be.

11
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:44,593
Four years ago, Shin Jae
Hyun's death was...

12
00:00:44,594 --> 00:00:45,896
disguised as suicide.

13
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:49,198
It was done by Jang Do Pal,
the former vice president...

14
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:50,267
Mr. Jang Do Pal.

15
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:54,503
(Arrest Warrant)

16
00:00:54,504 --> 00:00:56,073
Also, Actor Choi Tae Ho was...

17
00:00:56,706 --> 00:00:58,175
implicated in the crime.

18
00:00:59,276 --> 00:01:00,976
It was a murder plotted...

19
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,512
by those two men.

20
00:01:03,346 --> 00:01:05,816
I hereby request the prosecution...

21
00:01:06,349 --> 00:01:08,552
to re-investigate this case.

22
00:01:10,053 --> 00:01:13,355
- Watch out!
- Gosh. I said I wasn't in danger.

23
00:01:13,356 --> 00:01:15,559
You were. You know what
kind of a person he is.

24
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:23,967
Hello?

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,068
Tae Ho just left.

26
00:01:25,802 --> 00:01:26,803
Gate Three.

27
00:01:27,637 --> 00:01:28,672
Okay.

28
00:01:37,447 --> 00:01:40,784
Moreover, Yoon So Hee recorded the
sound of this murder scene...

29
00:01:40,984 --> 00:01:42,119
using her cell phone.

30
00:01:42,552 --> 00:01:44,454
Because of that, she became...

31
00:01:44,888 --> 00:01:48,125
the target of Jang Do Pal and
Choi Tae Ho's deceptive act.

32
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,430
I'd like to request...

33
00:01:53,563 --> 00:01:56,665
a thorough re-investigation
of Yoon So Hee's murder case.

34
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:58,802
How did So Hee record it?

35
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,639
Do you think Seo Joon Oh is
irrelevant to this case then?

36
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:05,119
Is Joon Oh going to be here
at the conference today?

37
00:02:05,408 --> 00:02:07,511
Is it certain that he's still alive?

38
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,644
We just arrested Choi Tae Ho.

39
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,979
We caught him running away.

40
00:02:57,694 --> 00:02:58,762
Okay.

41
00:02:59,963 --> 00:03:01,798
Choi Tae Ho has been
arrested by the police.

42
00:03:16,012 --> 00:03:17,080
That's enough.

43
00:03:17,314 --> 00:03:19,783
You should leave us something
to investigate on at least.

44
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,321
I urge the prosecution to carry out...

45
00:03:24,988 --> 00:03:27,356
a fair investigation, so
that there won't be...

46
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:29,426
any more victims.

47
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,462
That's all for today's conference.

48
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,902
(Episode 15)

49
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,503
Gosh, Ji Ah. Thank you.

50
00:03:41,504 --> 00:03:44,107
Thank you so much for not doing anything.

51
00:03:45,675 --> 00:03:47,710
Ji Ah played a very crucial role.
She didn't do anything.

52
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:49,980
- That's right.
- Why do I feel strange?

53
00:03:51,114 --> 00:03:53,683
I was worried because I couldn't reach you.

54
00:03:53,917 --> 00:03:54,918
You too, Mr. Jeong.

55
00:03:55,385 --> 00:03:58,187
By the way, is Tae Ho really arrested?

56
00:03:58,188 --> 00:04:00,456
Why do you keep asking that?
Are you disappointed?

57
00:04:00,457 --> 00:04:02,192
I'm not disappointed.

58
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,093
I just can't believe it.

59
00:04:04,094 --> 00:04:05,895
Jang Do Pal and Tae Ho are both arrested.

60
00:04:06,096 --> 00:04:07,663
I think you should...

61
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,900
take care of the company from tomorrow, Mr.
Vice President.

62
00:04:11,701 --> 00:04:13,870
- That's true.
- I'm going to find another agency.

63
00:04:14,537 --> 00:04:16,339
I didn't exactly ask for the job.

64
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,542
Besides, why would I take
care of the company?

65
00:04:19,809 --> 00:04:21,978
President Hwang is awake now.

66
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,813
He'll take care of it.

67
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,100
Am I right, President Hwang?

68
00:04:25,415 --> 00:04:27,916
Joon Oh. You should've asked
Ho Hang to be the spy,

69
00:04:27,917 --> 00:04:29,018
not Byeong Joo.

70
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,820
He's so good at acting that I thought...

71
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,322
he was on Jang Do Pal's side.

72
00:04:32,422 --> 00:04:34,057
You don't get it.

73
00:04:34,224 --> 00:04:35,492
It was so hard for me.

74
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:36,860
That's not how it looked.

75
00:04:38,094 --> 00:04:40,196
I wish every day is like today.

76
00:04:40,797 --> 00:04:43,866
I'm a bit anxious that only
good things are happening.

77
00:04:43,867 --> 00:04:46,102
You shouldn't be anxious about that.

78
00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:47,771
We still have one big task left.

79
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,439
Clearing Joon Oh's false charges?

80
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,075
Joon Oh. Don't worry about a thing.

81
00:04:52,676 --> 00:04:54,576
We'll tell the truth this time...

82
00:04:54,577 --> 00:04:56,246
and roll out a red carpet for you,

83
00:04:56,346 --> 00:04:58,280
so that you can make a glamorous return.

84
00:04:58,281 --> 00:04:59,882
Should I wear a suit?

85
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:01,318
Get me a suit.

86
00:05:01,484 --> 00:05:02,485
I will.

87
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,714
Hello.

88
00:05:31,715 --> 00:05:33,849
I'm an attorney from Choi and Park.

89
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:37,253
The Legend Entertainment's attorney
is already on Jang Do Pal's side.

90
00:05:38,221 --> 00:05:40,357
He hired another attorney.

91
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,925
He knows how to protect himself.

92
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,829
Search every detail of his doing.

93
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:50,400
Make sure Choi Tae Ho
doesn't get away with it.

94
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,701
Of course not.

95
00:05:59,342 --> 00:06:01,177
Why are you here?

96
00:06:01,811 --> 00:06:04,647
I have the right to be here.

97
00:06:04,748 --> 00:06:06,882
I heard you don't work in this office.

98
00:06:06,883 --> 00:06:08,817
It isn't your case either.

99
00:06:08,818 --> 00:06:11,253
It's considered malfeasance
if you don't stop.

100
00:06:11,254 --> 00:06:14,356
Consider it however you like.

101
00:06:14,357 --> 00:06:18,361
Resume the investigation on the
survivors' testimonies tomorrow.

102
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,196
What about Seo Joon Oh?

103
00:06:20,997 --> 00:06:22,798
I must meet him first.

104
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,700
Get the testimonies first.

105
00:06:24,701 --> 00:06:28,171
I need to see Joon Oh before
we resume the investigation.

106
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:30,940
When is he coming?

107
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,076
Get the testimonies first.

108
00:06:33,443 --> 00:06:35,878
- Follow the proper order.
- Proper?

109
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:39,348
We work in the same industry. Don't
tell me about what's proper.

110
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:41,450
We suspended the proceeding...

111
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:44,153
only because Seo Joon Oh was absent.

112
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,288
We'll do it properly when we meet him.

113
00:06:46,289 --> 00:06:47,457
Tell him...

114
00:06:47,924 --> 00:06:49,959
to come see us.

115
00:06:50,894 --> 00:06:53,896
If we resume the proceeding
of Seo Joon Oh's charges,

116
00:06:53,897 --> 00:06:56,799
you'll be charged for helping the culprit.

117
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,100
Aren't you aware of that?

118
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:01,003
You aren't in the position
to be so confident.

119
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,206
Try me.

120
00:07:04,107 --> 00:07:06,775
You're in trouble for having much evidence.

121
00:07:06,776 --> 00:07:08,778
I have nothing to fear anymore.

122
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:12,282
You promised to investigate properly.

123
00:07:13,216 --> 00:07:16,286
Lock up Jang Do Pal and Choi Tae Ho first.

124
00:07:16,753 --> 00:07:19,855
Everyone is watching you,
so you'd better be careful.

125
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,524
- Prosecutor Cho?
- Yes, sir.

126
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,963
It's evidence for attempted
murder of Hwang Jae Gook.

127
00:07:27,964 --> 00:07:29,965
The culprit works for Jang Do Pal.

128
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:32,801
This is also related to Choi Tae Ho.

129
00:07:32,802 --> 00:07:34,103
Keep it in mind.

130
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:35,939
Let's go, sir.

131
00:07:42,846 --> 00:07:45,348
(Hwang Jae Gook Attempted Murder Case)

132
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:08,470
There must be a special bond between us.

133
00:08:08,471 --> 00:08:10,339
I'm in charge of investigating...

134
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,275
your two murder cases.

135
00:08:19,516 --> 00:08:23,252
What's the conclusion you
reached with your attorney?

136
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:27,156
Mr. Jang said he knows nothing about it.

137
00:08:27,891 --> 00:08:31,427
He has nothing to say
because he's the culprit.

138
00:08:34,297 --> 00:08:35,798
How about you?

139
00:08:40,303 --> 00:08:43,773
Sir, I know I'm asking a big favor.

140
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,377
May I see Mr. Jang?

141
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,582
Why should I let you?

142
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:57,020
Do you need to have a chat
with your accomplice?

143
00:08:58,021 --> 00:09:00,857
I'd like to reduce your work.

144
00:09:04,494 --> 00:09:06,496
Please let me see him once.

145
00:09:14,237 --> 00:09:17,173
Yoon Tae Young finally caused a disaster.

146
00:09:18,508 --> 00:09:22,177
How dare he? He's a prosecutor like us.

147
00:09:22,178 --> 00:09:24,180
He can't do this to a fellow prosecutor.

148
00:09:24,881 --> 00:09:25,982
Listen carefully.

149
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,250
Nothing has changed for us.

150
00:09:28,251 --> 00:09:29,918
We investigated fairly.

151
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:32,488
We concluded Seo Joon Oh as the culprit.

152
00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:36,159
- Defend our position.
- Yes, sir.

153
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,029
Yoon Tae Young, that jerk.

154
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:46,868
Prosecutor Yoon, we're in
front of Bong Hee's house.

155
00:09:46,869 --> 00:09:48,770
There are some police officers.

156
00:09:48,771 --> 00:09:52,407
I know it's inconvenient, but
keep in hiding for a few days.

157
00:09:52,408 --> 00:09:56,211
Prosecutor Lee Jae Joon
is desperate to find you.

158
00:09:56,212 --> 00:09:58,313
Don't let him find you before...

159
00:09:58,314 --> 00:09:59,948
Choi Tae Ho is locked up.

160
00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:03,185
Are Jang Do Pal and Tae Ho arrested?

161
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:04,219
Yes.

162
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,722
You can sleep in peace tonight.

163
00:10:06,723 --> 00:10:10,158
I can't sleep in peace
tonight if I have to hide.

164
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,694
Thank you, Prosecutor Yoon.

165
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:20,770
Come on, we expected this to happen.

166
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,038
I'll move the car to somewhere discreet.

167
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,173
You don't have to do this.

168
00:10:25,174 --> 00:10:26,842
Go home and get some rest.

169
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:28,510
Here you go again.

170
00:10:28,511 --> 00:10:30,646
You told me to stay by your side.

171
00:10:30,647 --> 00:10:31,847
How can I go home alone?

172
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:35,017
It's unnecessary for both
of us to go through this.

173
00:10:35,018 --> 00:10:36,218
It's better that I suffer alone.

174
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:39,021
If you were me, would you
have gone home alone?

175
00:10:39,022 --> 00:10:42,758
Of course not. I care
about others too much.

176
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:45,761
See? I wouldn't feel
good if I rested alone.

177
00:10:45,762 --> 00:10:47,430
I won't feel comfortable.

178
00:10:48,798 --> 00:10:50,867
There isn't much we can change.

179
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,970
Let's go through this a
little longer, okay?

180
00:10:55,038 --> 00:10:58,540
Besides, you'll be very bored without me.

181
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:01,743
Of course, but I don't want
others to suffer because of me.

182
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,545
- Stop it.
- "Jerk"?

183
00:11:03,546 --> 00:11:05,714
- Stop it, stop it.
- "Jerk, jerk"?

184
00:11:05,715 --> 00:11:08,717
I said stop it. Don't say things like that.

185
00:11:08,718 --> 00:11:11,954
At times like this, we should stay strong.

186
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,725
We can do it. Okay?

187
00:11:16,025 --> 00:11:18,161
- Okay?
- We can do it.

188
00:11:19,195 --> 00:11:20,530
There we go.

189
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:38,447
Hello, Reporter Park.

190
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:42,284
Please don't do that. The
election is in a few days.

191
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:44,286
Don't publish the article yet.

192
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:45,921
You're doing it again!

193
00:11:45,922 --> 00:11:48,825
You're smart enough, but you keep doing it.

194
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,526
Wait, I have another call.

195
00:11:51,527 --> 00:11:52,761
Hello?

196
00:11:52,762 --> 00:11:55,464
It's not Ms. Cho.

197
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:57,666
It's not true. Who told you that?

198
00:11:57,667 --> 00:11:59,202
It isn't true. I'm hanging up.

199
00:12:01,204 --> 00:12:02,304
Hello?

200
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:05,507
Let's meet and talk over a meal.

201
00:12:05,508 --> 00:12:06,776
See you later.

202
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,445
Put your phone on vibrate.

203
00:12:10,446 --> 00:12:12,014
I'm sorry, ma'am.

204
00:12:18,287 --> 00:12:19,322
What time is it?

205
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:23,391
Where's Ji Ah? Let's check on her, Ki Joon.

206
00:12:23,392 --> 00:12:26,995
Where do you think you're going?
You're identified as a criminal.

207
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,598
He's identified as a criminal?

208
00:12:29,599 --> 00:12:32,200
Goodness, didn't you know?

209
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:34,536
- No.
- Jae Hyun's case is solved.

210
00:12:34,537 --> 00:12:36,338
What about So Hee's case?

211
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,273
I believe it's still in progress.

212
00:12:38,274 --> 00:12:41,077
It's okay.

213
00:12:50,253 --> 00:12:52,722
Did Mr. Jang visit you in China?

214
00:12:53,923 --> 00:12:55,691
He didn't visit us.

215
00:12:56,492 --> 00:12:58,027
He attacked us.

216
00:13:05,301 --> 00:13:07,202
He bribed the hospital staff.

217
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,539
At first, he tried to kill us.

218
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,874
At that time,

219
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,945
Ki Joon and I were being treated
at the hospital in China.

220
00:13:16,412 --> 00:13:17,914
Tae Ho came...

221
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,283
with men who looked like gangsters.

222
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:24,352
They chased and attacked us.

223
00:13:24,353 --> 00:13:26,255
This is what I found out later.

224
00:13:28,624 --> 00:13:32,395
He threatened Ki Joon that he'll
let us live if he says...

225
00:13:33,162 --> 00:13:34,997
Joon Oh murdered So Hee.

226
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:49,044
- Hello, Ji Ah.
- Come in.

227
00:13:49,045 --> 00:13:50,712
How was it? Are you okay?

228
00:13:50,713 --> 00:13:53,915
He only asked me to testify.

229
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,485
- Don't be nervous and good luck.
- Really?

230
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,621
- Okay, I'll be back.
- Good luck.

231
00:13:59,622 --> 00:14:01,891
I'll be back. Don't worry.

232
00:14:02,158 --> 00:14:03,759
Don't be nervous.

233
00:14:04,193 --> 00:14:05,995
- See you.
- Bye.

234
00:14:06,863 --> 00:14:08,997
I'm relieved to hear that.

235
00:14:08,998 --> 00:14:11,968
- Prosecutor Yoon convinced him.
- I suppose so.

236
00:14:12,468 --> 00:14:15,638
Something seemed strange though.

237
00:14:18,574 --> 00:14:19,875
What do you mean?

238
00:14:19,876 --> 00:14:22,578
He asked me strange questions at the end.

239
00:14:27,984 --> 00:14:30,318
I did it for President Hwang.

240
00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:31,888
I wanted to save him.

241
00:14:34,257 --> 00:14:36,124
If I didn't listen to him,

242
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,626
he said he'd kill President Hwang.

243
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:39,862
You saw it too.

244
00:14:40,096 --> 00:14:41,697
Joon Oh killed her.

245
00:14:41,898 --> 00:14:44,000
I had no choice but to obey him.

246
00:14:45,268 --> 00:14:48,070
I tried to tell the truth a few times.

247
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,207
When I saw him kill So Hee,

248
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,441
I tried to tell the truth.

249
00:14:53,442 --> 00:14:57,012
Unfortunately, I was kidnapped by Tae Ho.

250
00:14:57,013 --> 00:15:00,749
Sir, I know it's hard to believe me,

251
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,019
but I did it out of fear.

252
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,054
Tae Ho is really frightening.

253
00:15:06,055 --> 00:15:07,956
It's worse when he's angry.

254
00:15:07,957 --> 00:15:11,027
His eyes get very big when he's angry.

255
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:12,727
In the ship,

256
00:15:12,728 --> 00:15:14,329
he stared at me and smiled...

257
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:15,765
while covered in blood.

258
00:15:15,865 --> 00:15:17,466
He was so scary.

259
00:15:17,767 --> 00:15:20,503
He's practically a psychopath.

260
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,772
When he's angry, you never
know what he'll do.

261
00:15:22,972 --> 00:15:24,840
So please...

262
00:15:25,074 --> 00:15:27,310
put him in jail this time. I'm begging you.

263
00:15:29,645 --> 00:15:30,947
By the way, Mr. Tae.

264
00:15:31,881 --> 00:15:33,448
Isn't it that psychopath...

265
00:15:33,449 --> 00:15:35,918
who made you the vice president?

266
00:15:37,386 --> 00:15:38,387
What?

267
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,289
It's true.

268
00:15:40,957 --> 00:15:42,691
According to your testimony,

269
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,927
it's clear that you're a victim.

270
00:15:46,762 --> 00:15:49,298
But it's doesn't seem that way on paper.

271
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:52,668
I could understand it if you're
doing this to get a raise.

272
00:15:53,803 --> 00:15:54,837
What?

273
00:15:55,471 --> 00:15:57,273
I thought it was done,

274
00:15:57,974 --> 00:15:59,742
and that's when his eyes changed.

275
00:16:01,277 --> 00:16:04,347
Ms. Ha. Your image matches your
true personality very well.

276
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:05,881
You're very straightforward.

277
00:16:06,082 --> 00:16:07,882
I don't think you'd let
someone threaten you.

278
00:16:08,417 --> 00:16:11,019
Well... Nobody should let
someone threaten them.

279
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,622
That's not what I meant.
I'm a huge fan of yours.

280
00:16:13,789 --> 00:16:14,824
I just felt bad for you.

281
00:16:15,691 --> 00:16:18,027
Goodness. By the way, it says here...

282
00:16:18,761 --> 00:16:21,561
that your mother received a lot of
money from your company in advance.

283
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,771
How much money did she get?

284
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,773
Why are you asking me that?

285
00:16:31,774 --> 00:16:34,477
I just wanted to check.

286
00:16:34,844 --> 00:16:35,945
You don't need to answer.

287
00:16:37,646 --> 00:16:39,606
For a mother whose daughter
was being threatened,

288
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:41,584
she received a rather large sum.

289
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,121
What are you talking about?

290
00:16:47,123 --> 00:16:49,043
Is it true that you suffered
from a memory loss?

291
00:16:49,225 --> 00:16:52,161
The doctor's note said that
your memory had returned.

292
00:16:52,395 --> 00:16:55,598
Did you pretend not to remember
to protect Seo Joon Oh?

293
00:16:56,899 --> 00:16:57,966
Prosecutor Lee.

294
00:16:57,967 --> 00:16:59,869
I heard you two were a couple.
Is that correct?

295
00:17:00,403 --> 00:17:03,372
When did it start? From the deserted
island or since he was on the run?

296
00:17:04,974 --> 00:17:06,742
Is it something like Stockholm syndrome?

297
00:17:07,843 --> 00:17:09,912
What are you talking about?

298
00:17:11,647 --> 00:17:13,249
Where is Joon Oh?

299
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,453
Where is he right now?

300
00:17:22,158 --> 00:17:23,592
Maybe that prosecutor has...

301
00:17:23,926 --> 00:17:25,761
figured out everyone's disposition,

302
00:17:26,062 --> 00:17:27,462
and he's catching us off guard now.

303
00:17:36,739 --> 00:17:37,740
Gosh.

304
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:42,812
Why is it so hard to reach you?

305
00:17:43,846 --> 00:17:45,046
How is it going?

306
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:46,782
Which one are you asking about?

307
00:17:46,949 --> 00:17:47,982
The testimonies,

308
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,919
or Choi Tae Ho and Jang Do Pal?

309
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,422
Both.

310
00:17:54,023 --> 00:17:56,725
Jang Do Pal is with Choi Tae Ho right now.

311
00:17:57,093 --> 00:17:58,160
What?

312
00:17:58,594 --> 00:18:00,463
What brought them into the same room?

313
00:18:01,263 --> 00:18:03,265
Choi Tae Ho asked me if he could see him.

314
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,968
He did?

315
00:18:26,122 --> 00:18:27,256
President Jang.

316
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,227
You said you will help me.

317
00:18:33,229 --> 00:18:34,597
Do you still mean that?

318
00:18:37,266 --> 00:18:38,667
What are you talking about?

319
00:18:40,302 --> 00:18:42,671
How can you be saying that
while I'm in handcuffs?

320
00:18:42,771 --> 00:18:44,173
When you picked me for Dreamers,

321
00:18:45,107 --> 00:18:46,475
you told me that...

322
00:18:46,775 --> 00:18:48,543
if you could take one artist
from the entertainment,

323
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,079
you'd choose me.

324
00:18:51,614 --> 00:18:53,916
Isn't that why you helped
me when Jae Hyun died?

325
00:18:54,183 --> 00:18:55,217
You're right.

326
00:18:56,318 --> 00:18:57,720
We did have those days.

327
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,588
Please help me out one more time.

328
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,628
The attorney says...

329
00:19:06,428 --> 00:19:07,796
I can be released...

330
00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:11,667
if you take all the blame.

331
00:19:18,207 --> 00:19:21,177
Let's toughen up and do this in one go.

332
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,279
Please... Please don't kill me.

333
00:19:24,313 --> 00:19:25,681
Let's do this in one go.

334
00:19:26,015 --> 00:19:27,116
At once.

335
00:19:29,885 --> 00:19:30,953
Mr. Choi.

336
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,422
You're not a man of many words.

337
00:19:34,623 --> 00:19:35,658
Excuse me?

338
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:41,597
You're right.

339
00:19:42,398 --> 00:19:44,567
It looks like you've
been threatened as well.

340
00:19:46,569 --> 00:19:47,689
You're right about that too.

341
00:19:49,738 --> 00:19:51,440
If that's how this sounds to me,

342
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:54,610
it will sound like that in
other people's ears as well.

343
00:19:59,515 --> 00:20:02,151
I'll get out of here first and back you up.

344
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:05,600
One of us has to get out of
here if we both want to live.

345
00:20:05,688 --> 00:20:07,923
I'll go out first and get you released.

346
00:20:16,899 --> 00:20:20,269
You know that I'm the only
one who can help you.

347
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,838
This is what we've been always doing.
Am I right?

348
00:20:24,573 --> 00:20:26,541
He's trying to pressure your friends...

349
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:28,577
to capture you, Joon Oh.

350
00:20:28,911 --> 00:20:31,079
You shouldn't let it get to you.

351
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,215
If you do, you'll be doing
exactly what they want.

352
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,516
We totally let it get to us.

353
00:20:35,517 --> 00:20:36,552
Did you hear that?

354
00:20:37,453 --> 00:20:40,856
Bong Hee isn't saying anything
after giving her testimony.

355
00:20:41,123 --> 00:20:42,725
Maybe something happened in there.

356
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,793
Nothing happened.

357
00:20:45,628 --> 00:20:47,463
I just gave my testimony.

358
00:20:47,563 --> 00:20:49,365
Your face doesn't say so.

359
00:20:49,898 --> 00:20:52,601
Ji Ah and Ho Hang said they
don't feel good about it.

360
00:20:52,735 --> 00:20:54,655
It doesn't seem like
something serious happened.

361
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:55,838
You need to endure it.

362
00:20:56,572 --> 00:20:58,907
Both you and Bong Hee.

363
00:20:59,174 --> 00:21:01,110
What about Tae Ho? Is he behind the bars?

364
00:21:01,577 --> 00:21:03,911
By tonight, he will be.

365
00:21:03,912 --> 00:21:05,481
They can't keep him there much longer.

366
00:21:05,781 --> 00:21:08,816
I'll call you after checking if
there have been any changes with...

367
00:21:08,817 --> 00:21:09,937
Jang Do Pal and Choi Tae Ho.

368
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:20,295
Bong Hee. I picked out
this shirt on my own,

369
00:21:20,296 --> 00:21:22,164
and it's not itchy. Touch it.

370
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,998
- Come on.
- It's dangerous.

371
00:21:23,999 --> 00:21:25,067
Get back on your seat...

372
00:21:25,768 --> 00:21:26,802
and look ahead.

373
00:21:35,577 --> 00:21:37,379
(Seoul Supreme Prosecutors' Office)

374
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,661
Tae Ho just got released.

375
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,867
From this moment on,
we're changing the plan.

376
00:22:19,388 --> 00:22:20,389
Fine.

377
00:22:21,223 --> 00:22:23,025
I need you to do something for me then.

378
00:22:25,127 --> 00:22:26,161
What is it?

379
00:22:26,362 --> 00:22:27,429
The attorney says...

380
00:22:27,963 --> 00:22:30,165
if they find out that I tried
to kill President Hwang,

381
00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:31,900
I'd get a 20-year sentence.

382
00:22:32,368 --> 00:22:35,037
You can take care of that for me, right?

383
00:22:36,872 --> 00:22:39,742
Prosecutor Yoon gave the proof
of President Hwang's case...

384
00:22:40,376 --> 00:22:41,777
to Prosecutor Lee.

385
00:22:42,511 --> 00:22:43,512
There isn't much time.

386
00:22:43,846 --> 00:22:44,847
What are you doing?

387
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,215
Gosh. Who are you?

388
00:22:46,715 --> 00:22:47,716
What are you doing here?

389
00:22:49,418 --> 00:22:50,452
Make sure...

390
00:22:51,019 --> 00:22:52,354
you get rid of him,

391
00:22:53,389 --> 00:22:55,189
so there won't be any
problems in the future.

392
00:22:56,325 --> 00:22:57,393
Can you do that?

393
00:22:57,593 --> 00:22:59,661
I'll take care of it as
soon as I get out of here.

394
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,265
I'll try to reduce...

395
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,368
your sentence as much as I can.

396
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:44,573
I'm fine.

397
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,575
I'm just worried about you.

398
00:23:46,809 --> 00:23:48,876
This feels cramped and uncomfortable.

399
00:23:48,877 --> 00:23:50,144
It's uncomfortable for me too.

400
00:23:50,145 --> 00:23:52,314
I'm not doing this for you.
It's just too cold.

401
00:23:52,414 --> 00:23:54,014
If you don't share this blanket with me,

402
00:23:54,216 --> 00:23:56,852
your contract as my stylist will
be cancelled. Do you hear me?

403
00:23:57,753 --> 00:23:59,621
We don't need a contract.

404
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:05,360
I'm walking on eggshells...

405
00:24:05,561 --> 00:24:07,229
because you're acting this way.

406
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:10,566
Walking on eggshells
makes me feel pathetic.

407
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,368
Do you want your artist to be pathetic?

408
00:24:13,569 --> 00:24:16,672
Is that what you want? Should
I be pathetic and small?

409
00:24:18,407 --> 00:24:20,943
I didn't do anything to
make you feel pathetic.

410
00:24:21,143 --> 00:24:23,412
If you don't want that, lighten up.

411
00:24:24,613 --> 00:24:28,716
Hey. I consider talking to
you as talking to myself.

412
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,318
Since you don't answer me,

413
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:32,254
I feel like I'm alone
even when I'm with you.

414
00:24:37,459 --> 00:24:38,494
Gosh.

415
00:24:38,794 --> 00:24:41,530
What are you saying? Talking to
me is like talking to yourself?

416
00:24:49,338 --> 00:24:51,340
I know you're frustrated too.

417
00:24:53,509 --> 00:24:54,810
I know it's hard for you.

418
00:24:56,211 --> 00:24:57,546
If it was an ordinary woman,

419
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:00,382
I'm sure she couldn't have
endured a single day.

420
00:25:02,017 --> 00:25:03,452
You've endured it because it's you,

421
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,713
and you made it possible
for me to endure it too.

422
00:25:10,158 --> 00:25:11,760
Thank you.

423
00:25:13,295 --> 00:25:15,063
I'm nothing special,

424
00:25:15,898 --> 00:25:19,568
yet you've always trusted
me, stayed by my side,

425
00:25:20,469 --> 00:25:21,870
and protected me.

426
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:28,577
Stop it. You don't need to thank me.

427
00:25:32,648 --> 00:25:36,151
I'm fine. I really am.
Don't worry about me.

428
00:25:39,888 --> 00:25:42,924
All right. If that's the case,

429
00:25:42,925 --> 00:25:45,459
do you want this? You can have it.

430
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,230
- It's a different color. Try it on.
- What?

431
00:25:50,198 --> 00:25:52,000
Oh, the prosecutor is calling.

432
00:25:52,167 --> 00:25:54,970
Hello, Prosecutor Yoon.
Why didn't you come?

433
00:25:56,371 --> 00:25:59,441
My voice? Why? Is something going on?

434
00:26:02,077 --> 00:26:03,879
We've got a problem.

435
00:26:06,181 --> 00:26:07,749
Choi Tae Ho...

436
00:26:08,183 --> 00:26:09,651
got released.

437
00:26:31,573 --> 00:26:34,109
Lay low until things quiet down.

438
00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:35,577
Yes, sir.

439
00:26:46,588 --> 00:26:47,723
Let's go.

440
00:26:55,497 --> 00:26:57,299
Should I be congratulating you?

441
00:26:57,566 --> 00:26:59,668
You're finally free.

442
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,637
- I owe it all to you.
- What will you do now?

443
00:27:02,638 --> 00:27:04,473
Will you get yourself into trouble again?

444
00:27:05,307 --> 00:27:06,441
No.

445
00:27:07,376 --> 00:27:08,877
I want to live a quiet life.

446
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,247
Can I trust you?

447
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,183
This time,

448
00:27:15,751 --> 00:27:17,786
you got out somehow,

449
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,690
but I can bog you down with
it anytime if I want to.

450
00:27:22,624 --> 00:27:24,760
You must know that better
than anyone else does.

451
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,563
Reflect on the things you
did and repent. Got it?

452
00:27:36,505 --> 00:27:38,005
Jang Do Pal...

453
00:27:38,006 --> 00:27:41,343
apparently said that he acted alone.

454
00:27:42,778 --> 00:27:44,913
He said that Choi Tae Ho...

455
00:27:45,681 --> 00:27:48,949
had no choice but to comply
because he threatened him.

456
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:52,486
What... What does that...

457
00:27:52,487 --> 00:27:53,754
even mean?

458
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:56,324
Tae Ho is obviously not innocent.
How can they just release him?

459
00:27:57,959 --> 00:28:00,896
From Jang Do Pal to the prosecution,
has everyone gone insane or what?

460
00:28:01,196 --> 00:28:04,165
Lee Jae Joon helped him. I think
it's the prosecution's way...

461
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:07,569
of declaring that they won't
change their decision.

462
00:28:23,418 --> 00:28:25,153
I'll send you the information.

463
00:28:27,989 --> 00:28:30,025
I look forward to reading a great article.

464
00:28:46,308 --> 00:28:50,612
(Is Ra Bong Hee Guilty of Aiding
and Abetting the Murders?)

465
00:29:05,293 --> 00:29:06,393
Hi, Mom.

466
00:29:06,394 --> 00:29:08,597
Hi, Bong Hee.

467
00:29:08,797 --> 00:29:12,066
Where are you now? Are you...

468
00:29:12,067 --> 00:29:14,169
with him right now by any chance?

469
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,571
Yes.

470
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,308
What's wrong, Mom? Did something happen?

471
00:29:21,243 --> 00:29:22,476
Bong Hee.

472
00:29:22,477 --> 00:29:25,146
Just come home now.

473
00:29:25,147 --> 00:29:28,750
Let's talk in person
when you get here, okay?

474
00:29:32,087 --> 00:29:37,459
(Is Ra Bong Hee Guilty of Aiding
and Abetting the Murders?)

475
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:54,942
What is this now? Get in touch with
the reporter who wrote this...

476
00:29:54,943 --> 00:29:57,111
and ask him to remove anything
related to the commission.

477
00:29:57,112 --> 00:30:00,214
Why do these jerks keep trying
to drag us into the mess?

478
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,284
Well... But...

479
00:30:02,918 --> 00:30:05,653
Don't you think it's too harsh
to frame Ra Bong Hee...

480
00:30:05,654 --> 00:30:07,255
as an accessory to the murders?

481
00:30:07,455 --> 00:30:09,623
I get that it's important we
catch Seo Joon Oh, but still...

482
00:30:09,624 --> 00:30:11,059
We have no choice.

483
00:30:12,427 --> 00:30:14,061
All right. Let's head out now, everyone.

484
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,797
- Let's power up. We can do it!
- We can do it!

485
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:17,899
We got this!

486
00:30:20,168 --> 00:30:22,637
Let's do it. Goodness.

487
00:30:22,838 --> 00:30:26,607
At the special press conference
that was held a few days ago,

488
00:30:26,608 --> 00:30:28,342
Choi Tae Ho was named the prime suspect...

489
00:30:28,343 --> 00:30:31,011
for the Yoon So Hee murder case...

490
00:30:31,012 --> 00:30:33,614
as well as for the murder of an
unknown singer four years ago.

491
00:30:33,615 --> 00:30:36,450
However, Choi Tae Ho has
been acquitted and released,

492
00:30:36,451 --> 00:30:37,985
and the seeming lack of evidence...

493
00:30:37,986 --> 00:30:40,087
- Can you turn the volume up?
- Louder?

494
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,989
The police are facing
strong public criticism.

495
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:45,626
Gaining sympathy and pity from the public,

496
00:30:45,627 --> 00:30:49,064
Choi Tae Ho's popularity has
surpassed even that of his prime.

497
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:07,883
(Restricted Caller ID)

498
00:31:11,353 --> 00:31:13,888
- Joon Oh. It's me, Ki Joon.
- Hey.

499
00:31:13,889 --> 00:31:15,890
Joon Oh, have you seen the newspaper yet?

500
00:31:15,891 --> 00:31:17,659
Oh, right. You never read the newspaper.

501
00:31:18,326 --> 00:31:20,527
What's up? Why did you call me so early?

502
00:31:20,528 --> 00:31:23,497
Are you with Bong Hee now by any chance?

503
00:31:23,498 --> 00:31:26,368
She's in big trouble. Look
up her name on the internet.

504
00:31:27,769 --> 00:31:29,104
All right. I'll call you back.

505
00:31:36,912 --> 00:31:40,949
I'm going home for a bit
because my mom is sick.

506
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:44,719
Don't worry too much and
call me if anything happens.

507
00:31:59,701 --> 00:32:02,570
(Notice of Disciplinary Action)

508
00:32:09,644 --> 00:32:12,213
This notice of termination made
its way to me safe and sound.

509
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:16,517
Shouldn't you be packing up now?

510
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,353
I will leave,

511
00:32:19,287 --> 00:32:20,789
but there's something I want to know.

512
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:24,759
The Yoon So Hee murder case.
Have the two of you...

513
00:32:25,427 --> 00:32:27,829
already planned everything
out with preset results?

514
00:32:28,563 --> 00:32:30,698
- What?
- How dare you...

515
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:33,802
Prosecutor Yoon. I mean, Tae Young.

516
00:32:33,969 --> 00:32:36,972
It looks like you're approaching it
with an outcome already in mind.

517
00:32:37,172 --> 00:32:38,639
- Me?
- I think you want...

518
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,375
Choi Tae Ho to be the culprit
no matter what. Aren't I right?

519
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:44,845
You've been planning everything out
with Seo Joon Oh as the culprit.

520
00:32:44,846 --> 00:32:46,146
What are you talking about?

521
00:32:46,147 --> 00:32:48,015
That's also why you released Choi Tae Ho.

522
00:32:48,016 --> 00:32:50,884
Yoon Tae Young, just leave quietly.

523
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,553
Why are you trying to cause a ruckus?

524
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:54,121
You think we have it planned out?

525
00:32:54,122 --> 00:32:56,642
Do you falsely accuse people
whenever things don't go your way?

526
00:32:56,858 --> 00:32:59,626
Fine. I was mentally ready
to leave the prosecution,

527
00:32:59,627 --> 00:33:01,762
so I have no problem with actually leaving.
But just because I leave...

528
00:33:01,763 --> 00:33:04,264
doesn't mean you'll get a
free hand with this case.

529
00:33:04,265 --> 00:33:05,699
I'll be sure to put what I learned here...

530
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,269
to good use even after
leaving the prosecution.

531
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:12,607
I'll keep you on your toes.

532
00:33:16,211 --> 00:33:17,812
That little...

533
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,781
Gosh, I'm speechless.

534
00:33:20,782 --> 00:33:24,719
(Seo Joon Oh in Hiding)

535
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:31,259
(Why Is the First Survivor
Hiding Seo Joon Oh?)

536
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,297
That minx sure looks like she'd
be good at bewitching guys.

537
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:40,267
How can she walk around after
framing Tae Ho as a murderer?

538
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,771
I wouldn't even be able to step
out of my house if I were her.

539
00:33:43,471 --> 00:33:46,407
She wouldn't have done it in the
first place if she had any shame.

540
00:33:46,408 --> 00:33:48,976
Has she completely lost her mind or what?

541
00:33:48,977 --> 00:33:51,478
How can she dare to falsely accuse Tae Ho?

542
00:33:51,479 --> 00:33:55,049
Shouldn't we report her to the police?
Is there any cash reward?

543
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:57,552
- Cash reward?
- Call the police now.

544
00:33:59,821 --> 00:34:02,690
How dare she? That little...

545
00:34:05,026 --> 00:34:07,761
Isn't she the woman who was on the news?
That case...

546
00:34:07,762 --> 00:34:09,997
- That murder case?
- Yes, that's it.

547
00:34:09,998 --> 00:34:10,998
Seo Joon Oh.

548
00:34:10,999 --> 00:34:13,368
- Right, Seo Joon Oh.
- Does she have no shame?

549
00:34:16,938 --> 00:34:17,972
Gosh, seriously?

550
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,786
President Hwang, isn't
the air so fresh here?

551
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:38,093
Gosh, how nice.

552
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,029
President Hwang, shall
we go back to the ward?

553
00:34:59,581 --> 00:35:02,951
President Hwang. We're
being watched, right?

554
00:35:03,384 --> 00:35:05,053
Joon Oh.

555
00:35:06,121 --> 00:35:07,789
Joon Oh.

556
00:35:08,389 --> 00:35:09,724
Joon Oh?

557
00:35:10,391 --> 00:35:12,093
We're being watched because of him?

558
00:35:12,627 --> 00:35:14,596
Gosh, what about Joon Oh?

559
00:35:15,997 --> 00:35:18,399
Let's go to the restroom.

560
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,502
Let's hide there.

561
00:35:21,269 --> 00:35:22,270
Let's go.

562
00:35:43,658 --> 00:35:45,593
I think someone is tailing us.

563
00:35:47,962 --> 00:35:49,763
Should we stop contacting Joon Oh?

564
00:35:49,764 --> 00:35:51,299
Yes, for the time being.

565
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:52,967
Hello.

566
00:35:53,501 --> 00:35:54,802
Bong Hee went home.

567
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:57,738
It's safer than being with me.

568
00:35:57,739 --> 00:35:58,773
Yes.

569
00:35:59,174 --> 00:36:00,642
It's better that...

570
00:36:01,209 --> 00:36:02,911
you stay separately.

571
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:04,078
Ki Joon.

572
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:05,680
I'll call you later.

573
00:36:14,789 --> 00:36:16,090
Isn't that Seo Joon Oh?

574
00:36:16,224 --> 00:36:19,127
I doubt he'd be out in broad daylight.

575
00:36:21,729 --> 00:36:24,599
I heard that girl was Seo
Joon Oh's accomplice.

576
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:26,166
Who?

577
00:36:26,167 --> 00:36:28,136
Why would I ask if I knew who?

578
00:36:45,486 --> 00:36:48,890
(Why didn't you just die on the island?)

579
00:36:51,726 --> 00:36:53,493
(A murder accomplice)

580
00:36:53,494 --> 00:36:58,299
(Get lost. Why didn't you
just die on the island?)

581
00:37:03,571 --> 00:37:05,974
- Stop it!
- You wench!

582
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,674
What did you say?

583
00:37:07,675 --> 00:37:08,976
My goodness.

584
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:11,012
What? I didn't say anything wrong.

585
00:37:11,112 --> 00:37:13,780
Your daughter fell in love with a murderer.

586
00:37:13,781 --> 00:37:15,382
She's so naive.

587
00:37:15,383 --> 00:37:18,385
It's true that she lost her mind, isn't it?

588
00:37:18,386 --> 00:37:20,220
What did you say?

589
00:37:20,221 --> 00:37:21,922
How dare you say that?

590
00:37:21,923 --> 00:37:23,523
Instead of pouring soy sauce on you,

591
00:37:23,524 --> 00:37:25,259
I should have sealed your lips.

592
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,961
- Goodness.
- It's not me.

593
00:37:27,962 --> 00:37:30,163
I didn't say anything.

594
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:32,800
- I won't let you offend me again.
- I didn't say anything.

595
00:37:33,067 --> 00:37:34,669
No, it wasn't me.

596
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,443
Gosh.

597
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:45,179
Why did you appear out of nowhere?

598
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:48,149
Get out now!

599
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,950
You idiots!

600
00:37:49,951 --> 00:37:52,185
How dare you splash water on my daughter?

601
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,221
Hey!

602
00:38:12,407 --> 00:38:13,408
Mom.

603
00:38:16,611 --> 00:38:18,479
Has it been difficult because of me?

604
00:38:21,816 --> 00:38:22,884
Are you upset?

605
00:38:26,287 --> 00:38:27,355
Gosh.

606
00:38:29,357 --> 00:38:31,326
You must be very angry.

607
00:38:31,959 --> 00:38:33,961
Don't be angry, please?

608
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:35,897
Goodness.

609
00:38:36,197 --> 00:38:38,299
You have no idea, do you?

610
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:41,468
Do you know how terrible it is...

611
00:38:41,469 --> 00:38:43,471
when people have the
wrong impression of you?

612
00:38:44,372 --> 00:38:46,341
How did things turn out like this?

613
00:38:47,442 --> 00:38:48,609
No, Mom.

614
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,813
It's like a storm in passing.

615
00:38:52,146 --> 00:38:53,548
Everything will pass.

616
00:38:54,215 --> 00:38:57,185
Once it does, the truth will be revealed...

617
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,787
that Joon Oh and I...

618
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,490
are innocent.

619
00:39:02,623 --> 00:39:05,726
You're so stubborn. Whom do you take after?

620
00:39:05,727 --> 00:39:06,994
I'm strong...

621
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:10,465
and soft-hearted just like you.

622
00:39:10,698 --> 00:39:12,100
I'm just like you.

623
00:39:16,137 --> 00:39:17,138
Mom.

624
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:19,741
I'm hungry.

625
00:39:21,342 --> 00:39:23,544
I haven't eaten anything all day.

626
00:39:23,845 --> 00:39:25,946
How about some rice you make...

627
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,914
with vegetables and gochujang?

628
00:39:27,915 --> 00:39:29,850
Can you eat at a time like this?

629
00:39:29,851 --> 00:39:30,885
Yes.

630
00:39:32,887 --> 00:39:34,088
Things turned out this way,

631
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:36,457
so let's keep strong until the end.

632
00:39:38,693 --> 00:39:40,428
Tell that man.

633
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,797
If he doesn't handle this situation,

634
00:39:42,897 --> 00:39:44,799
I'll scold him.

635
00:39:44,899 --> 00:39:47,568
Joon Oh is very grateful to you.

636
00:39:47,668 --> 00:39:48,770
Forget it.

637
00:39:52,507 --> 00:39:54,074
Where are you going?

638
00:39:54,075 --> 00:39:55,576
How many spoons of gochujang?

639
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:57,178
Three spoons, please.

640
00:40:07,722 --> 00:40:10,792
I went to visit Jang Do Pal yesterday.

641
00:40:12,093 --> 00:40:13,161
I couldn't see him.

642
00:40:14,295 --> 00:40:15,430
They told me...

643
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,166
he hasn't met anyone yet.

644
00:40:18,366 --> 00:40:20,301
Is he afraid that he'll change his mind?

645
00:40:21,369 --> 00:40:22,470
That's possible.

646
00:40:22,637 --> 00:40:25,640
He has a lot to think about now that...

647
00:40:25,873 --> 00:40:27,308
Tae Ho is released.

648
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:31,478
For now, it'll be difficult
to visit Jang Do Pal...

649
00:40:31,479 --> 00:40:33,948
unless Tae Ho makes a move.

650
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,817
I have a lot of time now.

651
00:40:36,818 --> 00:40:39,520
I'll investigate both Jang
Do Pal and Choi Tae Ho.

652
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:44,892
Do you think there is a way?

653
00:40:45,026 --> 00:40:46,593
Anything is possible.

654
00:40:46,594 --> 00:40:47,695
What's difficult is...

655
00:40:48,129 --> 00:40:49,697
persevering until then.

656
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:53,901
Let's show them that nothing is impossible.

657
00:41:07,982 --> 00:41:10,051
I couldn't reach you all day.

658
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:11,786
You startled me.

659
00:41:13,955 --> 00:41:16,023
Why did you pick up so quickly?

660
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:18,726
I've been calling you. Don't
you check your phone?

661
00:41:20,461 --> 00:41:21,496
Really?

662
00:41:26,868 --> 00:41:29,270
Is everything okay at home?

663
00:41:31,672 --> 00:41:32,874
You read...

664
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:34,909
the article.

665
00:41:39,146 --> 00:41:41,048
I'm okay, Joon Oh.

666
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,117
No, you aren't.

667
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:46,420
Tell your mother.

668
00:41:47,021 --> 00:41:48,689
Once I wrap things up,

669
00:41:49,357 --> 00:41:52,059
I'll apologize to her in person.

670
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,161
There's no need to worry.

671
00:41:54,996 --> 00:41:56,664
Don't worry about that.

672
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:00,067
Keep hiding and be safe.

673
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:03,271
I'm safe, so don't worry.

674
00:42:03,971 --> 00:42:05,940
I'm worried about you.

675
00:42:06,574 --> 00:42:08,175
I'm fine.

676
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,278
Don't worry about me.

677
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:14,882
I'll come back tomorrow.

678
00:42:15,016 --> 00:42:16,784
That's too soon.

679
00:42:16,984 --> 00:42:19,887
Stay there longer. It's
difficult for you here.

680
00:42:20,087 --> 00:42:21,622
You'll be bored without me.

681
00:42:22,523 --> 00:42:23,523
Right, Joon Oh?

682
00:42:23,524 --> 00:42:25,326
That's true.

683
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,196
I'll come back tomorrow.

684
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,268
Bong Hee.

685
00:42:34,902 --> 00:42:35,903
Yes?

686
00:42:41,242 --> 00:42:42,543
Come back soon.

687
00:42:49,517 --> 00:42:50,551
I will.

688
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:24,285
Bong Hee.

689
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:25,585
Mom.

690
00:43:25,586 --> 00:43:27,922
What about breakfast?

691
00:43:31,292 --> 00:43:32,493
It's okay.

692
00:43:32,627 --> 00:43:34,127
I'm not hungry.

693
00:43:34,128 --> 00:43:36,163
You should eat at times like this.

694
00:43:36,497 --> 00:43:38,132
It'll help you.

695
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,341
Bong Hee.

696
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:49,276
Are you...

697
00:43:50,778 --> 00:43:51,812
sure that...

698
00:43:52,647 --> 00:43:54,548
you can trust him until the end?

699
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:57,218
Mom.

700
00:43:57,585 --> 00:43:59,153
To trust someone...

701
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:01,789
and support him always,

702
00:44:02,523 --> 00:44:04,058
you must be strong yourself.

703
00:44:05,793 --> 00:44:06,994
Can you do it?

704
00:44:12,299 --> 00:44:13,401
Mom.

705
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:17,805
You're crying again.

706
00:44:18,539 --> 00:44:19,807
Thank you.

707
00:44:21,542 --> 00:44:22,576
Thank you.

708
00:44:41,462 --> 00:44:42,496
Come here.

709
00:44:44,398 --> 00:44:45,566
Are you talking about me?

710
00:44:50,071 --> 00:44:51,137
Do you have your phone?

711
00:44:51,138 --> 00:44:52,173
Yes, I do.

712
00:44:52,473 --> 00:44:53,507
Give it to me.

713
00:45:05,052 --> 00:45:06,153
Hello, Byeong Joo.

714
00:45:07,354 --> 00:45:08,589
It's me, Joon Oh.

715
00:45:12,727 --> 00:45:13,961
Who?

716
00:45:14,328 --> 00:45:16,597
I was never acquainted
with someone like you.

717
00:45:17,598 --> 00:45:19,065
Why did you call?

718
00:45:19,066 --> 00:45:21,368
We used to call each other often.

719
00:45:22,703 --> 00:45:24,138
Things have changed so much.

720
00:45:24,438 --> 00:45:26,106
Stop spewing nonsense.

721
00:45:26,107 --> 00:45:27,340
Hey,

722
00:45:27,341 --> 00:45:30,745
I don't even want to hear your voice.
I'm going to hang up.

723
00:45:31,045 --> 00:45:32,313
Joon Oh.

724
00:45:33,948 --> 00:45:35,883
I don't want to take
things this far either.

725
00:45:37,084 --> 00:45:39,052
I'm human too.

726
00:45:39,053 --> 00:45:42,223
My heart will break if I have to
watch you become more pitiful.

727
00:45:43,057 --> 00:45:46,293
So please give up already.

728
00:45:47,094 --> 00:45:49,997
Give up if you want to make things
easier for those around you.

729
00:45:52,299 --> 00:45:54,201
I called to tell you that.

730
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:05,246
Tae Young, Tae Young!

731
00:46:06,881 --> 00:46:08,215
We've got a problem.

732
00:46:12,286 --> 00:46:14,754
We got Ra Bong Hee's current location.

733
00:46:14,755 --> 00:46:16,223
She's on her way back to Seoul now.

734
00:46:16,423 --> 00:46:18,959
Okay. Bring her here as
soon as she gets back.

735
00:46:20,294 --> 00:46:23,264
An arrest warrant has
been issued for Bong Hee.

736
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:26,966
It looks like Lee Jae
Joon dropped the bomb.

737
00:46:26,967 --> 00:46:28,169
What should we do?

738
00:46:33,274 --> 00:46:35,509
(Resume)

739
00:46:52,993 --> 00:46:55,196
(Prosecutor Yoon Tae Young)

740
00:47:00,467 --> 00:47:01,801
The number you have dialed is not...

741
00:47:01,802 --> 00:47:04,871
She's not picking up. I think
she's on her way back.

742
00:47:04,872 --> 00:47:06,841
She has no idea what's happening though.

743
00:47:07,374 --> 00:47:09,176
Shouldn't we try to find her?

744
00:47:16,150 --> 00:47:19,452
What will you do? They're
doing this to track you down.

745
00:47:19,453 --> 00:47:21,354
I'm aware. How can I not do anything?

746
00:47:21,355 --> 00:47:24,824
Please don't do this. Let's think
about what the best way is...

747
00:47:24,825 --> 00:47:26,627
What's there to think about?

748
00:47:27,728 --> 00:47:29,563
Bong Hee didn't do anything wrong,

749
00:47:29,897 --> 00:47:32,499
yet she's about to be arrested.
How could I...

750
00:47:34,568 --> 00:47:36,070
I must try to stop it.

751
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:11,739
(Prosecutor Yoon Tae Young)

752
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:25,819
Is Bong Hee still not picking up?

753
00:49:07,962 --> 00:49:10,798
Tae Young, I'll try to find Joon Oh first.

754
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:39,326
Excuse me, miss. Just a second.

755
00:49:40,427 --> 00:49:41,662
Well...

756
00:49:47,701 --> 00:49:48,869
Here.

757
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:55,576
Right. Thank you.

758
00:49:56,377 --> 00:50:00,514
Gosh, my neck. It's so tense.

759
00:50:05,219 --> 00:50:06,320
Ms. Ra Bong Hee.

760
00:50:24,571 --> 00:50:26,106
Why are you doing this to me?

761
00:50:27,207 --> 00:50:30,344
Where are you taking me? Let go.
Please let go of me.

762
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:32,345
Please tell me what's going on first.

763
00:50:32,346 --> 00:50:34,280
- Please come with us.
- What's going on?

764
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:37,183
- Let go. Why are you doing this?
- Please come with us.

765
00:50:37,184 --> 00:50:38,352
Please let go of me.

766
00:50:42,923 --> 00:50:44,424
Let's retreat for now.

767
00:50:44,425 --> 00:50:46,760
If people notice you,
you'll get caught too.

768
00:50:47,061 --> 00:50:49,630
- Let go of me, please.
- Please move out of our way.

769
00:50:55,502 --> 00:50:56,669
Come to your senses.

770
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:59,572
If you get involved now, both
of you will be arrested.

771
00:50:59,573 --> 00:51:01,041
There won't be anything I can do.

772
00:51:02,676 --> 00:51:05,946
Hang back if you want to save her.
You have to, no matter what.

773
00:51:12,186 --> 00:51:15,422
Let's get out of here
before things get messier.

774
00:51:20,861 --> 00:51:22,261
I'll ask...

775
00:51:22,262 --> 00:51:25,198
Byeong Joo to bring your car.

776
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:27,266
You have to be extremely careful
with everything at the moment.

777
00:51:27,267 --> 00:51:30,270
If they catch onto your tail,
you'll get into big trouble.

778
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:34,108
What's going to happen now?

779
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:37,744
They took Bong Hee.

780
00:51:40,614 --> 00:51:42,116
What will happen to her?

781
00:51:44,785 --> 00:51:46,854
When she meets Lee Jae Joon,

782
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:49,490
he'll ask her if she knows where you are.

783
00:51:56,096 --> 00:51:57,997
He will say that he'll let her go...

784
00:51:57,998 --> 00:52:01,668
if she tells him where you are.

785
00:52:02,769 --> 00:52:04,929
He'll keep asking her your
whereabouts persistently...

786
00:52:05,339 --> 00:52:07,608
until she tells him.

787
00:52:08,742 --> 00:52:10,610
He knows that making her suffer...

788
00:52:10,611 --> 00:52:12,646
is a sure way to catch you.

789
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,584
He'll do his best to drag it on...

790
00:52:18,318 --> 00:52:20,153
so that you're left with no choice...

791
00:52:20,154 --> 00:52:22,422
but to go to him on your own.

792
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:28,862
Where is Seo Joon Oh now?

793
00:52:32,966 --> 00:52:34,367
I don't know.

794
00:52:34,368 --> 00:52:37,048
If you keep this up, it'll only
make things more difficult for you.

795
00:52:37,304 --> 00:52:38,939
Just tell us, Ms. Ra.

796
00:52:42,643 --> 00:52:45,846
You can get out of here if
you tell us where he is.

797
00:52:50,984 --> 00:52:53,220
Are you really going to be like this?

798
00:52:57,558 --> 00:52:58,759
All right.

799
00:52:59,159 --> 00:53:01,995
Let's see who wins. Bring it on.

800
00:53:31,391 --> 00:53:34,294
About what you just said... Are you sure?

801
00:53:36,029 --> 00:53:37,097
Yes.

802
00:53:38,999 --> 00:53:41,401
I really don't think this is right.

803
00:53:43,437 --> 00:53:44,972
I can't let them do this.

804
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:07,761
You can go now.

805
00:54:25,746 --> 00:54:27,581
What happened?

806
00:54:30,951 --> 00:54:32,252
How did I...

807
00:54:32,386 --> 00:54:35,255
get released, Prosecutor Yoon?

808
00:54:40,227 --> 00:54:41,428
(Prosecutor Lee Jae Joon)

809
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:53,006
Joon Oh chose to do it.

810
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:03,417
No, Prosecutor Yoon. No.

811
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:09,923
You may think I've lost my mind,

812
00:55:10,324 --> 00:55:11,458
but there is no choice.

813
00:55:13,093 --> 00:55:14,294
There is only one way.

814
00:55:19,066 --> 00:55:20,167
I'll turn myself in.

815
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:26,340
Goodness, Mr. Seo Joon Oh.

816
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:28,875
It was very hard to meet you.

817
00:55:32,646 --> 00:55:34,648
Since you have turned yourself in,

818
00:55:35,282 --> 00:55:37,951
why don't we turn this into a great show?

819
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:45,225
You should've stopped him.

820
00:55:45,692 --> 00:55:48,695
You're the one who said he shouldn't
go to the prosecutors' office.

821
00:55:48,862 --> 00:55:50,864
How could you let him go like that?

822
00:55:52,199 --> 00:55:54,968
Turning himself in without any
plans means the end for him.

823
00:55:55,202 --> 00:55:56,602
What should we do, Prosecutor Yoon?

824
00:56:04,077 --> 00:56:05,112
Mr. Seo Joon Oh.

825
00:56:05,812 --> 00:56:06,880
Look.

826
00:56:07,147 --> 00:56:09,416
You've been silent for hours
since you stated your name.

827
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:10,951
For hours.

828
00:56:11,518 --> 00:56:13,120
Why aren't you answering my questions?

829
00:56:14,755 --> 00:56:16,890
Didn't you come here to turn yourself in?

830
00:56:19,893 --> 00:56:21,528
My goodness.

831
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:22,696
Is he still not talking?

832
00:56:22,896 --> 00:56:23,964
No, sir.

833
00:56:24,097 --> 00:56:25,499
It's been six hours.

834
00:56:25,999 --> 00:56:27,667
What is he trying to do?

835
00:56:54,294 --> 00:56:56,163
What is he doing with his food?

836
00:56:56,696 --> 00:56:57,697
My gosh.

837
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:11,111
He is a lunatic.

838
00:57:12,412 --> 00:57:14,881
Don't tell them anything for now.

839
00:57:16,183 --> 00:57:18,885
Whatever they do, do not
show any reactions.

840
00:57:19,653 --> 00:57:22,155
If you do that, they
will talk to you first.

841
00:57:22,456 --> 00:57:23,776
You eat your food in a funny way.

842
00:57:23,924 --> 00:57:24,925
Are you full?

843
00:57:25,625 --> 00:57:27,994
Let's do this quickly.

844
00:57:28,261 --> 00:57:30,664
Why did you kill Yoon So Hee?

845
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:34,167
I heard she called you a murderer.

846
00:57:34,301 --> 00:57:35,302
Is that correct?

847
00:57:36,570 --> 00:57:38,371
Are you going to remain silent?

848
00:57:38,505 --> 00:57:40,073
How long are you going to do this?

849
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:42,374
Listen.

850
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,845
You came to us yourself, didn't you?

851
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:46,746
Why aren't you talking?

852
00:57:47,681 --> 00:57:50,449
Things aren't going to get better no
matter how long you hold out for.

853
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:53,053
Do you think this will stop me
from putting you behind bars?

854
00:57:55,121 --> 00:57:56,256
What is it that you want?

855
00:57:57,090 --> 00:57:59,192
What are you doing this for?

856
00:58:00,594 --> 00:58:02,863
That's when you say this.

857
00:58:03,363 --> 00:58:06,500
It's an offer that Prosecutor Lee
will find the most tempting.

858
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:09,469
I'll talk.

859
00:58:11,872 --> 00:58:12,873
I'll talk,

860
00:58:13,106 --> 00:58:14,574
but do me a little favor.

861
00:58:14,841 --> 00:58:15,842
A favor?

862
00:58:16,977 --> 00:58:18,044
Jang Do Pal.

863
00:58:18,545 --> 00:58:19,980
Please let me see him.

864
00:58:20,514 --> 00:58:21,982
Why do you want to see him?

865
00:58:22,816 --> 00:58:24,284
If I let you see him,

866
00:58:25,519 --> 00:58:26,786
what good will it do me?

867
00:58:26,853 --> 00:58:28,955
You want only one thing, right?

868
00:58:29,289 --> 00:58:30,357
Who knows?

869
00:58:30,690 --> 00:58:32,058
If you let me see him,

870
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:34,694
maybe I will do something...

871
00:58:36,129 --> 00:58:37,163
for you in return.

872
00:58:38,198 --> 00:58:40,566
To Prosecutor Lee, nothing would be...

873
00:58:40,567 --> 00:58:43,670
more important than your
confession right now.

874
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:46,673
He will let you see Jang Do Pal...

875
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,174
at least once.

876
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:51,111
It's you who ordered someone to kill...

877
00:58:51,411 --> 00:58:52,445
Hwang Jae Gook, right?

878
00:58:55,215 --> 00:58:56,550
Where did you hide the hitman?

879
00:58:57,717 --> 00:58:59,419
There was a man with the injection.

880
00:59:00,387 --> 00:59:01,755
Answer me right now!

881
00:59:02,889 --> 00:59:06,092
Jang Do Pal will feel so much pressure.

882
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:07,661
The police are...

883
00:59:07,861 --> 00:59:10,664
doing everything to find his henchman.

884
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:14,568
Where are you taking me?

885
00:59:16,303 --> 00:59:17,470
If he gets caught,

886
00:59:17,671 --> 00:59:20,540
Jang Do Pal will soon be found
guilty of attempted murder.

887
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:23,944
That means, he will probably die in jail.

888
00:59:24,411 --> 00:59:25,946
He knows that,

889
00:59:26,246 --> 00:59:29,282
but he's still not doing anything
except remaining silent.

890
00:59:29,616 --> 00:59:30,817
What do you think that means?

891
00:59:31,851 --> 00:59:34,187
It means there must be
something he's counting on.

892
00:59:34,321 --> 00:59:36,201
Tae Ho must've been released
after an agreement.

893
00:59:36,256 --> 00:59:37,424
He must be it.

894
00:59:39,192 --> 00:59:41,328
Tae Ho must've promised to
take care of the hitman.

895
00:59:42,028 --> 00:59:43,096
Are you saying...

896
00:59:44,397 --> 00:59:45,899
I should come between...

897
00:59:46,766 --> 00:59:47,801
those two?

898
00:59:50,904 --> 00:59:52,805
Whether you can win over Jang
Do Pal to your side or not...

899
00:59:52,806 --> 00:59:54,474
is up to you now, Joon Oh.

900
01:00:07,454 --> 01:00:09,356
Nothing is certain,

901
01:00:09,889 --> 01:00:10,890
so...

902
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:12,859
it won't be easy.

903
01:00:15,095 --> 01:00:17,497
What are you wearing on your head?

904
01:00:19,099 --> 01:00:20,200
You look good.

905
01:00:20,767 --> 01:00:22,369
Why did you want to see me?

906
01:00:22,969 --> 01:00:24,537
Do you think it's okay to leave them...

907
01:00:25,271 --> 01:00:26,306
alone like that?

908
01:00:27,073 --> 01:00:28,241
Just turn up the volume.

909
01:00:29,409 --> 01:00:30,510
How is your stay here?

910
01:00:31,311 --> 01:00:32,946
I have nothing to worry about now,

911
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:34,347
so I do feel better.

912
01:00:34,514 --> 01:00:36,116
You're just broad-minded.

913
01:00:36,983 --> 01:00:38,551
You're in jail instead of Tae Ho.

914
01:00:39,686 --> 01:00:40,754
Listen.

915
01:00:42,922 --> 01:00:44,323
If you're trying to provoke me...

916
01:00:44,324 --> 01:00:45,824
to gain something out of it...

917
01:00:45,825 --> 01:00:46,826
Does Tae Ho...

918
01:00:48,662 --> 01:00:49,696
come to see you often?

919
01:00:51,698 --> 01:00:54,000
Do you know what he's up to these days?

920
01:00:56,469 --> 01:00:57,536
Do I have to know that?

921
01:00:57,537 --> 01:00:59,439
Of course, you do.

922
01:01:01,174 --> 01:01:03,108
If you took all the blame...

923
01:01:03,109 --> 01:01:05,644
in exchange for a favor, you
should at least know...

924
01:01:05,645 --> 01:01:06,880
if he's doing a good job.

925
01:01:19,626 --> 01:01:22,262
Do you think Tae Ho will really
do what you asked him to do?

926
01:01:23,663 --> 01:01:26,066
You do nasty things for him,

927
01:01:26,499 --> 01:01:28,868
but he won't do anything for you.

928
01:01:30,470 --> 01:01:33,073
It looks like he has forgotten
about what you asked him.

929
01:01:34,741 --> 01:01:36,076
I don't know what you're saying.

930
01:01:36,976 --> 01:01:39,278
I never asked him to do
anything for me, and...

931
01:01:39,279 --> 01:01:40,346
President Hwang...

932
01:01:43,116 --> 01:01:44,484
can speak now.

933
01:01:51,758 --> 01:01:54,027
So? What are you trying to say?

934
01:01:54,527 --> 01:01:56,429
I don't know why I'm listening to this.

935
01:01:58,498 --> 01:01:59,499
What is he doing?

936
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:01,767
Do you trust Tae Ho that much?

937
01:02:01,768 --> 01:02:02,802
Get off of me!

938
01:02:03,269 --> 01:02:04,637
- Get in there. Hurry!
- Yes, sir.

939
01:02:06,005 --> 01:02:07,473
What is Joon Oh doing?

940
01:02:07,474 --> 01:02:08,508
Open the door.

941
01:02:08,541 --> 01:02:09,576
Open it now!
