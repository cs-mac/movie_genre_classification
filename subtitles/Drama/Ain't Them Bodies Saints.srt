1
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,151
Ruth.

2
00:00:46,147 --> 00:00:47,522
Hey, Ruth.

3
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:50,599
Where are you going?
Home.

4
00:00:50,601 --> 00:00:52,401
Home's the other way.
Not mine.

5
00:00:52,403 --> 00:00:55,137
Are you going back
to your mom's?

6
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:59,041
It's a 15-mile walk.
I know how far it is.

7
00:00:59,043 --> 00:01:00,943
All right. Well, then,
I'll just walk with you.

8
00:01:00,945 --> 00:01:03,078
You do whatever you want.
What I want to do is take you

9
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,746
back to our house.
Why did you tell Freddy you

10
00:01:04,748 --> 00:01:06,682
were gonna strike out
on your own?

11
00:01:06,684 --> 00:01:09,618
I don't think I said that, but

12
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,422
if I did, when I say, "on my
own," I mean you and me.

13
00:01:12,424 --> 00:01:16,125
I always mean you and me.

14
00:01:16,127 --> 00:01:17,235
Hey.

15
00:01:20,643 --> 00:01:22,322
You gonna leave me?

16
00:01:22,634 --> 00:01:24,867
No, I'm not gonna leave you.
Nobody's leaving any...

17
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:27,036
'cause I will leave you first.

18
00:01:27,038 --> 00:01:31,641
It's not... Funny.

19
00:01:31,643 --> 00:01:37,313
I'm not gonna leave you.
You're not gonna leave me.

20
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:39,607
Because if you do, I'll just
follow you.

21
00:01:43,655 --> 00:01:49,192
I don't want to go to jail.
Not going to jail.

22
00:01:49,194 --> 00:01:53,872
And that shack ain't a home.
Well, I'm working on it.

23
00:02:01,391 --> 00:02:03,543
And I think I'm gonna have a baby.

24
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:20,555
We're gonna have a baby?

25
00:02:23,462 --> 00:02:29,166
You're not mad? I'm not mad.

26
00:02:29,168 --> 00:02:32,803
No, my mama will raise it.

27
00:02:32,805 --> 00:02:35,739
# Can I steal a kiss?

28
00:02:40,713 --> 00:02:43,781
Stop it. That tickles.
That's what you're supposed

29
00:02:43,783 --> 00:02:47,284
to do, is sing songs.
Just talk.

30
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,086
Are you tired?

31
00:03:14,017 --> 00:03:16,666
Bluebird, bluebird.

32
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:32,609
All right.

33
00:03:39,573 --> 00:03:42,907
I'll be fine.

34
00:03:46,975 --> 00:03:48,937
I'll be back in five minutes.

35
00:04:13,561 --> 00:04:14,905
We've got a little bit of a

36
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,909
chase on our hands here...
I tell you, walking into

37
00:04:16,911 --> 00:04:18,844
there, you feel like you're
meeting the devil.

38
00:04:18,846 --> 00:04:22,181
All cars for backup.
I repeat, all cars, all cars...

39
00:04:22,183 --> 00:04:25,050
any and all cars.
Shit. All right. Check, hon.

40
00:04:36,831 --> 00:04:37,715
Ugh!

41
00:04:44,906 --> 00:04:48,541
Ugh!

42
00:04:48,543 --> 00:04:51,944
I'm hit! I shot someone.

43
00:04:51,946 --> 00:04:56,949
I think I shot someone.

44
00:04:56,951 --> 00:05:00,553
It's okay.

45
00:05:00,555 --> 00:05:04,658
Oh, my God.

46
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,462
Hey. Hey.

47
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:28,063
I think I shot someone.
Oh, shit.

48
00:05:30,686 --> 00:05:35,889
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun, Ruth.

49
00:05:40,362 --> 00:05:42,596
What are you doing?
Listen to me.

50
00:05:42,598 --> 00:05:45,031
We're gonna stand up and walk
out there.

51
00:05:45,033 --> 00:05:46,700
No. Okay. I'm gonna go first.

52
00:05:46,702 --> 00:05:49,536
You come after me.
That's how it's gonna be.

53
00:05:49,538 --> 00:05:52,973
No. We can make it.
We can make it if we run.

54
00:05:52,975 --> 00:05:55,942
We can't make it, Ruth.
Yeah, we can.

55
00:05:55,944 --> 00:05:57,677
They're gonna shoot us.
If we stay in here,

56
00:05:57,679 --> 00:05:59,246
they're gonna shoot us
right where we are.

57
00:05:59,248 --> 00:06:00,080
No. Please.

58
00:06:00,082 --> 00:06:01,415
I'm gonna do it.

59
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:03,184
I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not going to jail!

60
00:06:03,186 --> 00:06:04,987
Shh. You got to tell them I
did everything.

61
00:06:04,988 --> 00:06:06,721
Tell them that me and Freddy did
everything.

62
00:06:06,723 --> 00:06:08,923
You got a gun in your hands
'cause I put it there.

63
00:06:08,925 --> 00:06:11,092
You tell them you were scared
and I put it there.

64
00:06:11,094 --> 00:06:12,927
I'm gonna be out in a blink, and
I'm gonna come back.

65
00:06:12,929 --> 00:06:14,929
All you got to do is wait for me.

66
00:06:14,931 --> 00:06:19,634
I promise I'll come get you.
Just wait for me, okay?

67
00:06:19,636 --> 00:06:21,636
Just wait for me.

68
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:31,849
So, I lost my boy.
And that leaves you...

69
00:07:32,591 --> 00:07:37,104
And Bob.
Only Bob don't got a choice.

70
00:07:38,554 --> 00:07:43,317
I'm confused, Ruth.
I took you kids in...

71
00:07:44,684 --> 00:07:47,610
raised you and Bob
like you were my own.

72
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,023
How do you go and
do a thing like this?

73
00:07:53,261 --> 00:07:56,273
We were just doing
what you taught us to do.

74
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,516
Is that a boy or a girl?

75
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,963
Do you know yet?
I don't know.

76
00:08:09,347 --> 00:08:14,083
So, what do you want to do,
Ruth?

77
00:08:14,085 --> 00:08:16,262
I'm gonna wait for him.

78
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,423
Dear Ruth...

79
00:08:21,493 --> 00:08:24,560
I dreamed about you again last night.

80
00:08:24,562 --> 00:08:30,333
I guess I dream about you every
night... and most days, too.

81
00:08:30,335 --> 00:08:34,537
I hold your face in my mind.
I put your voice together in my

82
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:37,073
head. I think about your hair

83
00:08:37,075 --> 00:08:39,509
getting longer.
I think about your belly

84
00:08:39,511 --> 00:08:43,112
getting bigger.
I hear people talk about regret,

85
00:08:43,114 --> 00:08:46,749
but I haven't got any.
I don't think poorly on the

86
00:08:46,751 --> 00:08:50,820
things I've done.
We did what we did, and that is

87
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:53,289
who we are.
They're gonna cross out this

88
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:56,093
sentence before you get to read it,
but I know you know what it

89
00:08:56,095 --> 00:08:59,163
says.
Every day, I wake up thinking

90
00:08:59,165 --> 00:09:02,666
today's the day I'm gonna see
you, and one of these days, it

91
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:05,169
will be so.
And until then, I'll keep

92
00:09:05,171 --> 00:09:07,871
writing you.
I'll write you every day.

93
00:09:07,873 --> 00:09:11,375
And someday you'll get a letter
from me, and you will look up,

94
00:09:11,377 --> 00:09:15,245
and it'll be me who's handing it
to you.

95
00:09:15,247 --> 00:09:17,915
And then we can forget about
words, and I'll touch your face

96
00:09:17,917 --> 00:09:21,151
and I'll kiss you.

97
00:09:41,489 --> 00:09:43,401
Bob Muldoon, are you awake?

98
00:09:44,243 --> 00:09:47,511
Yeah. You got a baby girl.

99
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,635
And I'll take our baby girl
in my arms...

100
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:18,309
And we will ride off to somewhere...
somewhere far away.

101
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,478
Hey.

102
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,251
Write to me soon, any chance
you get.

103
00:10:36,863 --> 00:10:38,863
Love, Bob.

104
00:10:53,181 --> 00:10:54,065
Mommy. Mommy.

105
00:11:28,249 --> 00:11:33,452
Mommy. Mommy.

106
00:11:33,454 --> 00:11:36,021
Mornin'. Mommy.

107
00:11:36,023 --> 00:11:39,024
How'd you sleep? Good.

108
00:11:39,026 --> 00:11:42,862
You hungry? No.

109
00:11:42,864 --> 00:11:45,798
What's up? Come here.

110
00:11:49,699 --> 00:11:51,692
Let's go back to sleep.

111
00:13:21,932 --> 00:13:26,120
Mommy! Look what I found!

112
00:13:26,569 --> 00:13:29,870
What'd you find? Kitties!

113
00:13:29,872 --> 00:13:32,673
Where did these come from?
I don't know.

114
00:13:32,675 --> 00:13:35,142
How many are you?

115
00:13:35,144 --> 00:13:39,380
You're just a tiny little thing.
Aren't you tiny?

116
00:13:39,382 --> 00:13:42,450
Where's your mama at?

117
00:13:42,452 --> 00:13:44,485
What are you crying for? Huh?

118
00:13:44,487 --> 00:13:47,823
Maybe he wants me. What?

119
00:13:47,825 --> 00:13:51,460
Maybe he wants me.
Maybe he does.

120
00:13:51,462 --> 00:13:54,129
But you still have two more bites.

121
00:13:54,131 --> 00:13:57,199
"And the little horse ran and"

122
00:13:57,201 --> 00:14:01,069
ran, and foxes chased him, and
he could hear them barking.

123
00:14:01,071 --> 00:14:04,873
And the wolves ran after him,
and he could hear them howling,

124
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:07,209
"but he knew they couldn't catch him. "

125
00:14:07,211 --> 00:14:10,112
Bear.
Yeah, there's that baby bear.

126
00:14:10,114 --> 00:14:12,614
Your daddy loves bears.
He used to wrestle with them.

127
00:14:12,616 --> 00:14:15,751
He'd tackle them down.
He'd bop them on the nose.

128
00:14:48,668 --> 00:14:50,582
Sylvie, put your shoes on.

129
00:14:51,137 --> 00:14:52,512
Okay.

130
00:15:00,036 --> 00:15:01,967
Hey. Morning, miss Guthrie.

131
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,344
I was hoping to catch you
before work.

132
00:15:04,669 --> 00:15:07,804
Is something wrong?
I was hoping for a word.

133
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:10,273
How many cats you got? Four.

134
00:15:10,275 --> 00:15:14,243
Yeah? What's this one's name?
Willow.

135
00:15:14,245 --> 00:15:19,248
He looks like a Jimmy to me.

136
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:23,286
How'd you get those cats?

137
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:26,155
Get down. Found them out back.

138
00:15:26,157 --> 00:15:30,059
Oh, thank you.
Mama was long gone, I guess.

139
00:15:30,061 --> 00:15:33,729
Well, you need someone to
take a few of them off your

140
00:15:33,731 --> 00:15:35,565
hands?
I can handle some kittens, at

141
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:39,535
least.

142
00:15:42,271 --> 00:15:46,411
Like I said, uh...
They're setting to get ready to

143
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:52,182
call you down to the station,
and, uh, it's gonna be all over

144
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:55,886
the news later.
Thought best if you hear this

145
00:15:55,888 --> 00:16:00,057
from a friend. Hear what?

146
00:16:12,088 --> 00:16:15,059
Bob tried to escape five
times already.

147
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:20,244
Did you know that? No, sir.

148
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:22,946
Well, maybe six times is the charm.

149
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:27,084
The boys he broke free with got
caught trying to hop a train up

150
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:29,696
near bartlesville, heading north.

151
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,122
Maybe Bob's doing likewise.

152
00:16:36,251 --> 00:16:39,065
Maybe he's already long gone.

153
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:42,934
Maybe. What do you think?

154
00:16:42,936 --> 00:16:47,739
I don't know.
Anybody asking about him...

155
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:52,177
anybody at all? Nope.

156
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:57,382
What about those letters?
Everyone read them before

157
00:16:57,384 --> 00:17:00,818
they even got sent.
They don't say anything.

158
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,888
You want to just bring them
in anyway?

159
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:08,026
I'll do whatever you want,
but he won't come back.

160
00:17:08,028 --> 00:17:12,263
He's not coming back for me if
that's what you're thinking.

161
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:23,257
Ruth!

162
00:17:32,723 --> 00:17:37,314
Did she tell you anything?
Did she tell you anything?

163
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,892
No, gene.
She didn't say a damn thing.

164
00:17:39,894 --> 00:17:42,761
I'm surprised.
I thought she'd like you better

165
00:17:42,763 --> 00:17:46,265
than me.
Let me have this one, huh?

166
00:17:46,267 --> 00:17:48,367
Well, hell, pat.
You're the one he shot.

167
00:17:48,369 --> 00:17:50,636
I'm gonna let you catch the son
of a bitch.

168
00:17:50,638 --> 00:17:53,872
Yep. Sorry I'm late.

169
00:17:53,874 --> 00:17:57,276
She had to have a time-out.
She got in a fight with Miles.

170
00:17:57,278 --> 00:18:00,679
Why did you get into a fight
with those boys?

171
00:18:00,681 --> 00:18:03,749
They called me names.
You need to have a better

172
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:05,751
reason than that.

173
00:18:12,953 --> 00:18:16,819
Come on. Upsy-Daisy. Oy.

174
00:18:16,998 --> 00:18:22,234
Evening.

175
00:18:22,236 --> 00:18:25,938
Hi. Hey, little girl.

176
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:30,175
Hi.
Don't you look pretty today?

177
00:18:30,177 --> 00:18:32,811
You got a birthday coming up,
don't you?

178
00:18:32,813 --> 00:18:37,049
Well, you got your birthday list
put together yet?

179
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,205
You better get on that.
Get your mama to help you.

180
00:18:44,493 --> 00:18:50,196
I heard the news.
Anything you want to talk about?

181
00:18:50,198 --> 00:18:53,166
Everyone thinks I got
something to tell them.

182
00:18:53,854 --> 00:18:55,716
I don't have a goddamn thing.

183
00:18:58,106 --> 00:19:00,728
They say they traced
him to Montana.

184
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,518
You think he's in Montana?

185
00:19:08,003 --> 00:19:11,839
I can make some phone calls,
see what I can do about putting

186
00:19:12,521 --> 00:19:15,221
an end to all this.
I could put an end to all

187
00:19:15,681 --> 00:19:19,496
this right now all by myself.
All I'd have to do is...

188
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:24,197
Tell the truth.

189
00:19:36,906 --> 00:19:41,225
# Hey, little blue Jay,
sing me a song #

190
00:19:41,517 --> 00:19:46,520
# About Santa Ana at the
San Anton' #

191
00:19:46,522 --> 00:19:51,459
# Hey, blue Jay, can I steal
a kiss #

192
00:19:51,461 --> 00:19:57,264
# Like they tried to steal a
Cannon from Gonzales? #

193
00:19:58,316 --> 00:20:04,007
# Bluebird, whistle Waterloo
# will you come to the bower

194
00:20:04,417 --> 00:20:07,126
I've shaded for you? #

195
00:20:07,617 --> 00:20:12,231
# Hey, little blue Jay,
sing me a tune #

196
00:20:12,883 --> 00:20:17,820
# Down way in Mexico,
back in June #

197
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:10,118
Excuse me, ma'am.

198
00:21:10,587 --> 00:21:11,531
Ma'am?

199
00:21:18,488 --> 00:21:20,470
Keep driving and stick to the
highway.

200
00:21:22,186 --> 00:21:24,319
Where are we, anyway? What?

201
00:21:24,321 --> 00:21:27,889
Where are we?
What state are we in?

202
00:21:27,891 --> 00:21:31,561
Missouri.
Oh, Missouri?

203
00:21:37,303 --> 00:21:39,372
I recognize you.

204
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:10,163
Hey, how do you turn it up?

205
00:23:10,198 --> 00:23:11,728
On the side, there's a
little, uh...

206
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:15,265
Yeah, that's it.

207
00:23:16,202 --> 00:23:20,873
# And lonely nights, I think
of people that I miss #

208
00:23:22,374 --> 00:23:28,046
# And every day, I think of
others you might miss #

209
00:23:28,482 --> 00:23:30,003
Where you planning on going?

210
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:33,700
A direction that hasn't been invented yet.
#... The sound of...

211
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:37,622
I don't know.
# I could never forget about

212
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:42,660
you #
# the good times and the bad

213
00:23:42,662 --> 00:23:45,530
so, uh...

214
00:23:45,532 --> 00:23:49,100
How'd you do it?
Do what... get out?

215
00:23:49,102 --> 00:23:52,303
Yeah. Is this how fellas are

216
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:57,408
wearing their hair?

217
00:23:57,410 --> 00:24:02,814
Well, man, I just started
walking, you know... just like I

218
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:08,586
said I would.

219
00:24:12,128 --> 00:24:13,491
And just walked out?

220
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,142
Yep.

221
00:24:18,164 --> 00:24:21,799
How's that work?
Well, you know, the guards...

222
00:24:21,801 --> 00:24:25,837
they come by your cell every night...

223
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,842
Sort of saying, "lights out" and
rattling bars with their sticks.

224
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:32,344
And this one guard... he used to
always joke and carry on with

225
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:36,815
us.
And one night I said, "well, I"

226
00:24:36,817 --> 00:24:41,453
won't be seeing you much longer.
I figure I'll be out of here in

227
00:24:41,455 --> 00:24:44,790
about 10 days. "
He said, "how you gonna do it?"

228
00:24:44,792 --> 00:24:48,360
I said, "I'm gonna just walk
right out the door. "

229
00:24:48,362 --> 00:24:51,730
And he said they'd stop me.
And I said, "no, sir. "

230
00:24:51,732 --> 00:24:55,834
I've got better things to do. "
And he said, "well, that's not

231
00:24:55,836 --> 00:24:58,804
how it works. "
And I said, "well, it only works

232
00:24:58,806 --> 00:25:01,240
that way 'cause you think it has to.

233
00:25:01,242 --> 00:25:05,377
See, I've got a higher calling.
I've got a wife and a little

234
00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:10,849
girl who needs her daddy. "
And he asked me what I know

235
00:25:10,851 --> 00:25:13,285
about higher callings... says
even if I do get out, I'm gonna

236
00:25:13,287 --> 00:25:18,290
have to answer to God and the
devil for the things I done.

237
00:25:18,292 --> 00:25:24,161
I tell him... Shoot.
I tell him...

238
00:25:28,008 --> 00:25:29,950
I tell him, "sir... "

239
00:25:30,736 --> 00:25:36,176
I used to be the devil.
Now I'm just a man. "

240
00:25:36,178 --> 00:25:41,347
As the days tick by...
10, 9, 8...

241
00:25:41,349 --> 00:25:43,372
and on the last day...

242
00:25:46,163 --> 00:25:50,835
The bars open up,
and I walk right out.

243
00:25:53,452 --> 00:25:55,878
News says you jumped
off a work truck.

244
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:00,681
Yeah.

245
00:26:04,016 --> 00:26:05,647
Well...

246
00:26:17,901 --> 00:26:20,325
Man, have you got anything to eat?

247
00:26:20,822 --> 00:26:24,959
I'm still a little bit hungry.

248
00:26:24,961 --> 00:26:30,531
Well, I'll find something.

249
00:26:30,533 --> 00:26:35,378
Have you seen Ruth lately?
Nope. It's been a while.

250
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:43,244
She don't live with her
mama no more.

251
00:26:43,246 --> 00:26:47,414
Got a new house. A new house?

252
00:26:47,416 --> 00:26:50,985
Mm-hmm. Skerritt's been
looking after her.

253
00:26:50,987 --> 00:26:54,855
He got her all set up.
Guess I should tell you got a

254
00:26:54,857 --> 00:26:58,392
call the other day asking about you.

255
00:26:58,394 --> 00:27:00,561
Oh, yeah? What'd you tell 'em?

256
00:27:00,563 --> 00:27:04,231
I told them I hadn't seen
you, which I hadn't.

257
00:27:05,063 --> 00:27:07,377
Didn't think I'd be
seeing you so soon.

258
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,600
That's the truth.

259
00:29:45,269 --> 00:29:48,790
I guess that's about... that's
about what I owe you.

260
00:29:52,171 --> 00:29:55,439
Where'd this come from?

261
00:29:55,441 --> 00:30:00,177
All over. Whose is it?

262
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:03,413
It's mine.

263
00:30:09,421 --> 00:30:14,424
Sounds like that wood's gone soft.

264
00:30:14,426 --> 00:30:18,596
Yeah, I expect you're right.
More nails just won't hold it.

265
00:30:18,598 --> 00:30:21,399
The whole gutter just comes off
the house every time it rains

266
00:30:21,401 --> 00:30:23,167
like this.
You know, I go out there and

267
00:30:23,169 --> 00:30:25,236
nail it back up.
Next thing you know, it's back

268
00:30:25,238 --> 00:30:27,205
off.
Well, you can either do that

269
00:30:27,207 --> 00:30:29,207
or get more buckets.

270
00:30:29,209 --> 00:30:32,043
Yeah, I could do that.
That'd be easier in the

271
00:30:32,045 --> 00:30:34,412
short-term, for sure.
Then I'd have to haul that water

272
00:30:34,414 --> 00:30:36,180
out every time it rains.
I don't know.

273
00:30:36,182 --> 00:30:38,516
Howdy! Howdy to you.

274
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:43,488
Yeah, all this rain we've
been having reminds me of that

275
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:47,658
one march, it was.
We'd get 101/2 inches in a day.

276
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:51,062
Man.
Oh, my middle tank out there has

277
00:30:51,064 --> 00:30:53,398
gone dry, and the other two...
say, can you tell me just

278
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,869
what town we're in, exactly?
This is meridian.

279
00:30:57,871 --> 00:31:01,439
Okay. See, we passed through

280
00:31:01,441 --> 00:31:04,208
Glen rose, but we didn't see a
sign... didn't know if we'd gone

281
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:07,545
too far, not far enough.
Well, that depends on where

282
00:31:07,547 --> 00:31:11,849
you're headed.
We're headed here.

283
00:31:11,851 --> 00:31:15,220
You, uh, plan to hunt some
deer?

284
00:31:15,222 --> 00:31:18,924
Thinking about it.
Anyway, it rained so much, it

285
00:31:18,926 --> 00:31:21,260
filled up them tanks, and my
wife walked up there to check

286
00:31:21,262 --> 00:31:23,695
'em the next day, and there was
catfish lyin' there.

287
00:31:23,697 --> 00:31:26,465
That thing filled up, and it was
spillin', and it had come out in

288
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,699
the spill.

289
00:31:27,701 --> 00:31:30,202
Are these real? Come again?

290
00:31:30,204 --> 00:31:35,040
Are these real? You bet.

291
00:31:35,042 --> 00:31:39,645
How old are they?
Well, that pistol goes back

292
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:43,282
125 years. You don't say.

293
00:31:43,284 --> 00:31:47,519
See that scrap of paper there

294
00:31:47,521 --> 00:31:50,956
next to it?

295
00:31:50,958 --> 00:31:56,628
That there is a list...
Of every poor son of a bitch who

296
00:31:56,630 --> 00:32:01,934
met his end at the barrel of it.

297
00:32:01,936 --> 00:32:04,092
Sounds like a bunch of
bullshit to me.

298
00:32:04,888 --> 00:32:07,010
Yeah, probably is.

299
00:32:09,775 --> 00:32:12,791
Can I help you gentlemen
find something in particular?

300
00:32:12,826 --> 00:32:17,283
Nah. Just looking around.

301
00:32:31,859 --> 00:32:33,616
Is there any news?

302
00:32:34,569 --> 00:32:37,604
No, not today. Uh...

303
00:32:38,154 --> 00:32:43,129
Figured you want these back.
They're just gathering dust.

304
00:32:46,615 --> 00:32:49,682
You read 'em? No, ma'am.

305
00:32:49,684 --> 00:32:52,952
Why not? Everyone else has.

306
00:32:52,954 --> 00:32:56,055
They're not mine to read.

307
00:33:04,755 --> 00:33:08,462
Can I ask you something?
Mm, sure.

308
00:33:09,639 --> 00:33:12,139
Do you mean what you said
about Bob not coming back for

309
00:33:12,141 --> 00:33:18,078
you? Yeah, I did.

310
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,782
Well, I was thinking maybe
you all'd want to get out of

311
00:33:21,784 --> 00:33:27,588
town until all this blows over.
You mean till he gets caught?

312
00:33:28,575 --> 00:33:32,362
Where would we go?
Someplace safe.

313
00:33:35,148 --> 00:33:37,004
Would you come?

314
00:33:38,807 --> 00:33:40,939
Someone would come with you.

315
00:33:46,688 --> 00:33:49,626
I think I'll just stay here.
You know, I got to work, and

316
00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:53,247
Sylvie's got her birthday.
We'll be just fine.

317
00:33:53,249 --> 00:33:55,683
Yeah, sure. She's gonna be 4.

318
00:33:55,685 --> 00:33:57,618
Is that right? Yep.

319
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:01,722
Yeah. What's she want?

320
00:34:01,724 --> 00:34:04,692
She wants a horse.
Like, a real horse?

321
00:34:04,694 --> 00:34:09,731
Yep. Yeah?

322
00:34:09,733 --> 00:34:13,001
Where you gonna put it?

323
00:34:13,003 --> 00:34:15,270
You know what?
I know a man who... who could

324
00:34:15,272 --> 00:34:17,372
sell you one for... for not a
bad price.

325
00:34:17,374 --> 00:34:19,040
You do? I do.

326
00:34:19,042 --> 00:34:24,212
I can't take care of no horse.

327
00:34:24,214 --> 00:34:28,950
Well... No horse.
Maybe I could, uh... maybe I

328
00:34:28,952 --> 00:34:32,220
could bring her something. Why?

329
00:34:32,222 --> 00:34:36,658
Well, I was just doing some
cleaning, and...

330
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:39,995
I... I may have a few deals just
floating around that maybe,

331
00:34:39,997 --> 00:34:41,563
uh... maybe she'd take to,
you know?

332
00:34:41,565 --> 00:34:43,465
Just... A few deals, huh?

333
00:34:43,467 --> 00:34:44,866
A few deals.

334
00:34:52,102 --> 00:34:53,769
Dear Ruth...

335
00:34:55,584 --> 00:34:58,145
I don't know how
to start this letter.

336
00:34:58,181 --> 00:34:59,748
I have got a million things on

337
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,183
my mind, and I need
to get them out.

338
00:35:02,185 --> 00:35:04,886
I know you know I am out, and I
hope you know I am coming for

339
00:35:04,888 --> 00:35:09,158
you, just like I always said.
Just like I always said I was

340
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:13,029
going to do, I am coming for
you.

341
00:35:13,031 --> 00:35:16,332
I wish I were standing at your
side, whispering in your ear,

342
00:35:16,853 --> 00:35:21,590
but that's not so. I came across the
woods and mountains with no shoes on.

343
00:35:23,282 --> 00:35:27,546
I traveled high and far,
and now I am close.

344
00:35:29,573 --> 00:35:33,018
I'm so close to you, I can almost
reach out and touch your cheek.

345
00:36:34,617 --> 00:36:36,365
Here you go, Don.

346
00:36:46,809 --> 00:36:48,634
You boys take it easy, now.

347
00:37:00,253 --> 00:37:03,333
Well... Look at you, Bob.

348
00:37:04,144 --> 00:37:07,912
Break out of parson and head
straight back here.

349
00:37:07,914 --> 00:37:13,251
Maybe not the smartest move.
Long as you don't turn me in.

350
00:37:27,523 --> 00:37:31,615
Where's Miles?
Miles is gone.

351
00:37:31,938 --> 00:37:36,040
Gone? Gladys is gone, too.

352
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:40,322
It's just me now.
Well, who's running the show?

353
00:37:44,275 --> 00:37:47,877
No show to run... not anymore.

354
00:37:51,391 --> 00:37:56,861
Didn't this belong to Freddy?
Doubt it.

355
00:37:57,543 --> 00:38:02,468
I remember playing with this.
And all those little Indians...

356
00:38:04,104 --> 00:38:06,205
have you got those Indians
someplace?

357
00:38:07,268 --> 00:38:09,699
Anything of Freddy's is long gone.

358
00:38:12,379 --> 00:38:17,115
Hmm. What do you want, Bob?

359
00:38:17,117 --> 00:38:19,918
I was just wondering if you'd
heard anything.

360
00:38:20,822 --> 00:38:22,158
About what?

361
00:38:25,394 --> 00:38:28,741
About that local man who
escaped from the penitentiary.

362
00:38:31,018 --> 00:38:32,269
Gene Dentler and a bunch of

363
00:38:32,304 --> 00:38:35,434
his deputies come over a few
days ago for a chat.

364
00:38:35,436 --> 00:38:38,303
I told them I could think of at
least six sons of bitches who've

365
00:38:38,305 --> 00:38:43,575
got a mind to see you dead but
that it'd be more fun to sit

366
00:38:43,577 --> 00:38:49,147
back and take bets on who gets
you first.

367
00:38:49,149 --> 00:38:52,417
You fucked over your share of
people in your day.

368
00:38:52,419 --> 00:38:58,123
Yeah, and then I got caught.
Not by them, you didn't.

369
00:38:58,125 --> 00:39:01,327
Well, they might as well quit
looking.

370
00:39:01,329 --> 00:39:05,598
Old Bob Muldoon's about to
disappear.

371
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:09,335
And where's old Bob Muldoon
gonna disappear to?

372
00:39:10,534 --> 00:39:14,296
I'm thinking about settling
down, build a little house,

373
00:39:15,916 --> 00:39:18,799
open a shop. I don't know.

374
00:39:20,171 --> 00:39:24,577
Get old. Like you.

375
00:39:28,323 --> 00:39:31,190
On your own?

376
00:39:38,332 --> 00:39:40,974
Oh. So, I heard you bought
Ruth a house.

377
00:39:41,536 --> 00:39:44,704
I'm letting her stay in one
of my old places.

378
00:39:44,706 --> 00:39:48,274
It's got a big old yard where
her little girl can play.

379
00:39:48,276 --> 00:39:51,711
Hey, that's my little girl,
too.

380
00:39:51,713 --> 00:39:57,284
Man, I'll tell you... she's about
cute enough to make

381
00:39:57,832 --> 00:40:02,868
you want to give up.
You did one thing right.

382
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:07,561
I'll give you that.
I do what I can to look after

383
00:40:07,563 --> 00:40:11,699
both of them. Yeah.

384
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:15,369
Well, I guess I'll handle it
from here.

385
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:19,340
Oh, you think so? Yes, sir.

386
00:40:19,342 --> 00:40:21,273
Well, I'll tell you what.

387
00:40:24,327 --> 00:40:26,448
You do whatever you want.

388
00:40:27,583 --> 00:40:32,319
You take all your money and you
get yourself as far away from

389
00:40:32,321 --> 00:40:37,250
here as you possibly can.
But you listen to me when I tell you...

390
00:40:39,533 --> 00:40:41,729
You leave those girls alone.

391
00:40:43,408 --> 00:40:48,735
I can't do that. Yeah, you can.

392
00:40:53,466 --> 00:40:58,522
And why would I?
Well, now, think about it, Bob.

393
00:40:59,972 --> 00:41:02,397
If you got any trouble
coming your way...

394
00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:05,468
They sure as hell
don't need that.

395
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,092
What trouble is that?

396
00:41:13,332 --> 00:41:17,737
You got out.
What more do you want?

397
00:41:19,603 --> 00:41:22,003
I want my family.

398
00:41:25,502 --> 00:41:28,941
So do I. But I don't got it.

399
00:41:30,881 --> 00:41:35,116
Now, this is how it works.
I will never hurt you more than

400
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:38,853
I'm hurting you now.
I will never lay another hand to

401
00:41:38,855 --> 00:41:43,158
you or prick your finger or
pinch your cheek.

402
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,494
I won't call the sheriff, and I
won't tell them where you've

403
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:49,664
been. But if I hear that

404
00:41:49,666 --> 00:41:54,203
old Bob Muldoon has been talking
to Ruth Guthrie...

405
00:41:54,205 --> 00:42:00,142
You asked me about trouble.
I will make sure you got some.

406
00:42:19,097 --> 00:42:21,720
Freddy was the one
who shot first that day.

407
00:42:22,914 --> 00:42:25,643
Nobody would have gotten
hurt if he hadn't done that.

408
00:42:26,658 --> 00:42:28,308
Go on, Bob.

409
00:42:30,141 --> 00:42:35,945
I got to unlock my door.
Get out of here before someone

410
00:42:35,947 --> 00:42:38,948
sees you.
Find yourself someplace safe.

411
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:43,953
Where are the keys?

412
00:42:43,955 --> 00:42:45,855
In the truck. The keys?

413
00:42:45,857 --> 00:42:49,892
I'm gonna give her trouble?
I'm gonna give her trouble?

414
00:42:49,894 --> 00:42:53,230
He thinks he can buy her a
house?

415
00:42:53,232 --> 00:42:54,865
No, sir.
I don't think that's how it

416
00:42:54,867 --> 00:42:57,467
works.
Ruth will walk away from that

417
00:42:57,469 --> 00:43:01,905
house like it was on fire.

418
00:43:01,907 --> 00:43:04,207
Pen... I need a pen.

419
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:07,210
Give me a pen.

420
00:43:11,939 --> 00:43:13,177
No damn sense.

421
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,087
Excuse me.

422
00:44:48,753 --> 00:44:50,129
Come here.

423
00:44:55,065 --> 00:44:56,596
I was thinking...

424
00:44:59,112 --> 00:45:01,281
Maybe we could go on a trip...

425
00:45:04,031 --> 00:45:09,334
After your birthday.
What do you think about that...

426
00:45:09,732 --> 00:45:11,725
going someplace new?

427
00:45:13,364 --> 00:45:16,269
Just get in the car
and drive and drive.

428
00:45:17,312 --> 00:45:19,129
Be real fun.

429
00:45:27,813 --> 00:45:29,095
Hey!

430
00:45:29,763 --> 00:45:31,090
Hey, hold on.

431
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:41,182
Let me see that. Give it here.

432
00:45:55,905 --> 00:45:59,614
There you go. Come on. Go.

433
00:46:18,819 --> 00:46:21,385
What do you think about me
closin' up... take you for a

434
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:24,528
ride somewhere...
Get away for a little bit?

435
00:46:24,946 --> 00:46:27,380
Hmm?

436
00:46:30,418 --> 00:46:33,953
Hey, sweetie.

437
00:46:33,955 --> 00:46:37,457
How you been? Just fine.

438
00:46:37,459 --> 00:46:41,894
Break the law or something?

439
00:46:41,896 --> 00:46:45,165
No.
I just hadn't seen you around in

440
00:46:45,167 --> 00:46:48,969
years, it feels like.
I stay put.

441
00:46:48,971 --> 00:46:52,573
You want something to drink?
No, sir. Thank you.

442
00:46:52,575 --> 00:46:55,843
We're looking for an old friend
of yours.

443
00:46:55,845 --> 00:46:59,413
I'm sure you heard the news.
Yeah. Yeah.

444
00:46:59,415 --> 00:47:02,716
A couple cops came by from
Monroe's asking questions.

445
00:47:02,718 --> 00:47:07,421
All right. Have you seen him?

446
00:47:07,423 --> 00:47:11,625
Sure haven't. Look, all right.

447
00:47:11,627 --> 00:47:16,096
You mind if I take a look
around?

448
00:47:16,098 --> 00:47:21,235
Billy, mind the bar?
Hope we can make this quick.

449
00:47:21,237 --> 00:47:24,238
Don't want to rile up my
customers.

450
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:28,509
Haven't heard from him since

451
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:30,444
last winter.
He sent me a letter.

452
00:47:30,446 --> 00:47:34,815
You write him back? Nope.

453
00:47:34,817 --> 00:47:37,751
Weren't you part of his old
gang... Bob Muldoon,

454
00:47:37,753 --> 00:47:40,854
Ruth Guthrie, Freddy?
Nope. Got out of that racket.

455
00:47:40,856 --> 00:47:46,394
Got myself this business.

456
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:56,145
Hell.
Left the darn key downstairs.

457
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:59,507
Well... Hold up.

458
00:48:26,684 --> 00:48:29,255
I'm gonna need to get back to
the register before too long.

459
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:48,220
Been using it as a bookmark.
I guess I lost my place.

460
00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:53,963
Ruth give it to you?
She mailed it.

461
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:57,809
Asked me, uh... asked me to send
it on to Bob.

462
00:48:59,971 --> 00:49:03,639
You never did.
Like I said, I'm bad with

463
00:49:03,641 --> 00:49:08,711
correspondence. How long ago?

464
00:49:08,713 --> 00:49:14,183
How old's the little girl?
3, going on 4.

465
00:49:14,185 --> 00:49:19,889
About that long, then. Okay.

466
00:49:19,891 --> 00:49:25,194
Uh, mind if I hang on to this?
By all means.

467
00:49:25,196 --> 00:49:27,930
I'm sure you'll call us if
you hear anything.

468
00:49:27,932 --> 00:49:29,932
Sure bet.

469
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:39,489
Look at this.

470
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:43,937
This is the first thing you ever
wore, the day you were born.

471
00:49:46,331 --> 00:49:50,456
You were so tiny.
Look how small it is.

472
00:49:54,126 --> 00:49:57,360
I brought you home, and you
slept and slept for hours.

473
00:49:57,362 --> 00:50:02,899
You were such a good little
girl.

474
00:50:02,901 --> 00:50:08,371
I'll bring this with us just
because...

475
00:50:08,373 --> 00:50:14,177
We might need it someday.
"And the little horse picked up"

476
00:50:14,179 --> 00:50:19,416
his shoes and ran until he was
out of the dark woods.

477
00:50:19,418 --> 00:50:21,651
He came to the river where the
fish had been.

478
00:50:21,653 --> 00:50:24,688
The fish was gone now, and there
was no one there to stop him

479
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:28,725
from crossing.
He crossed the river and climbed

480
00:50:29,404 --> 00:50:31,774
the hill, and before too long,
he could see home. "

481
00:50:35,158 --> 00:50:38,723
What's wrong, sweet girl?
Why are you so quiet?

482
00:50:40,681 --> 00:50:45,904
Everything's gonna be fine.
You just wait and see, okay?

483
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:18,221
Have you heard from Bob?

484
00:52:20,841 --> 00:52:24,176
Why don't you come in? No.

485
00:52:24,178 --> 00:52:28,814
I know Bob's been around.
Will you see to it that he gets

486
00:52:28,816 --> 00:52:33,219
this? What is it?

487
00:52:33,221 --> 00:52:38,958
You can read it if you want.
I figure you will anyway.

488
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:43,767
If you see him...
Can you tell him...

489
00:52:46,568 --> 00:52:48,735
Just... just give it to him.

490
00:53:06,207 --> 00:53:10,977
Dear Bob...
I hope you never get this.

491
00:53:12,451 --> 00:53:14,884
I want you to come
through that door,

492
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,766
take us away just
like you always said.

493
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,432
But you can't.

494
00:53:24,572 --> 00:53:29,809
You can't come here...
not right now.

495
00:53:29,811 --> 00:53:34,882
And I can't go with you.
If you come here, they'll catch

496
00:53:34,884 --> 00:53:38,552
you.
If we go with you, they'll find

497
00:53:38,554 --> 00:53:43,123
us. It can't end like that.

498
00:53:43,125 --> 00:53:47,528
I can't let it end like that,
not for us...

499
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:53,400
And not for Sylvie.
I can't let that happen.

500
00:53:56,645 --> 00:54:01,968
So, we're gonna go. If you come
looking for us here, we'll be gone.

501
00:54:03,654 --> 00:54:06,436
I'll go somewhere where
no one knows who we are,

502
00:54:06,997 --> 00:54:11,732
or we can wait for the
time to be right and the

503
00:54:11,987 --> 00:54:14,034
world to forget about us.

504
00:54:15,987 --> 00:54:18,893
I don't know how to
explain this any better,

505
00:54:19,354 --> 00:54:22,232
but I know you know
what I'm talking about.

506
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:28,905
We've waited so long.
We've just got to wait a little longer.

507
00:54:33,009 --> 00:54:36,926
Come find us. I know you will.

508
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:41,405
I hope you will.
We'll find each other.

509
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:48,407
I love you so much. I do.

510
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:13,981
It's time to wake up, baby girl.

511
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:23,610
Sweet pea...

512
00:55:25,662 --> 00:55:30,466
Good morning. Happy Birthday.

513
00:56:37,469 --> 00:56:38,353
You seen him?

514
00:58:15,342 --> 00:58:17,403
We stopped by his girl's place.

515
00:58:28,013 --> 00:58:30,918
Hartigan said to tell you
something if we ran into you.

516
00:58:30,953 --> 00:58:34,886
What's that?

517
00:58:34,888 --> 00:58:40,525
Shit, I forgot. Oh.

518
00:58:40,527 --> 00:58:45,263
Let me tell you something.
You take that and do what you

519
00:58:45,265 --> 00:58:50,268
will.
And if you don't find him...

520
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:53,205
That don't give you cause to
come back here.

521
00:58:53,207 --> 00:58:58,376
You understand?
Don't think I'm washing my hands

522
00:58:58,378 --> 00:59:02,914
of all this.
And if you set foot in this town

523
00:59:02,916 --> 00:59:07,419
again...
If you even think about bringing

524
00:59:07,421 --> 00:59:13,191
those girls into this...
I'll kill you.

525
00:59:13,193 --> 00:59:16,962
And that'll be that. Dude.

526
00:59:19,968 --> 00:59:24,470
Warren Miller.
Who makes up the names?

527
00:59:24,472 --> 00:59:27,273
They ain't made up.
They're real folks.

528
00:59:27,275 --> 00:59:30,443
I mean, they're dead, but...
They're real.

529
00:59:30,445 --> 00:59:33,846
Oh, really? Mm-hmm.

530
00:59:33,848 --> 00:59:36,242
So I'm told.
Ruth and Sylvie, too?

531
00:59:36,993 --> 00:59:38,111
Yep.

532
00:59:39,731 --> 00:59:41,863
Nobody's gonna be
asking after us?

533
00:59:42,475 --> 00:59:44,322
Not anymore.

534
00:59:44,893 --> 00:59:47,260
Good job.

535
00:59:47,262 --> 00:59:50,630
You make a wish?
What did you wish for?

536
00:59:50,632 --> 00:59:53,299
I'm not telling. All right.

537
00:59:53,301 --> 00:59:56,002
You keep your little secret, huh?

538
01:00:23,134 --> 01:00:27,864
How do I look?
You look like you.

539
01:00:29,038 --> 01:00:34,908
Then that'll do.
The way I see it, I didn't waste

540
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:38,245
my time.
You remember old Joe cranston?

541
01:00:38,247 --> 01:00:41,982
Yep.
Remember that time he and I

542
01:00:41,984 --> 01:00:43,650
went up to St. Louis? Mm-hmm.

543
01:00:43,652 --> 01:00:46,887
He spent about three hours
getting prettied up before we

544
01:00:46,889 --> 01:00:48,055
got in the car to go up there.
I said, "Joe, what are you"

545
01:00:48,057 --> 01:00:51,859
doing?"
He said, "well, in case anything

546
01:00:51,861 --> 01:00:56,129
happens to me, I want to make
sure my mama can recognize me. "

547
01:00:56,131 --> 01:00:58,799
So he put on this coat he had
when he was 12 years old, and he

548
01:00:58,801 --> 01:01:01,168
tried to button it up, and he
was a big old boy, and it ripped

549
01:01:01,170 --> 01:01:04,838
right out the back.
And he kept that thing on all

550
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:07,774
the way up to St. Louis and back
down to Texas.

551
01:01:07,776 --> 01:01:10,277
He looked like a damn
raggedy Ann.

552
01:01:10,279 --> 01:01:13,213
And when we got back, I said,
"Joe, you know your mama would

553
01:01:13,215 --> 01:01:15,549
have recognized you if something
happened to you. "

554
01:01:15,551 --> 01:01:18,453
He said, "yeah, 'cause I had my
coat on. "

555
01:01:18,455 --> 01:01:20,955
I mean, he didn't get it.
You see, people... they don't

556
01:01:20,957 --> 01:01:23,324
know things the way that they
think they know them.

557
01:01:32,424 --> 01:01:34,586
Sylvie... she's gonna know me.

558
01:01:36,599 --> 01:01:38,886
She'll know me
without looking at me.

559
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:46,347
And Ruth... by God, she'll feel
me coming down the street.

560
01:01:46,349 --> 01:01:51,920
I mean, we always just been...
You know, just two parts of the

561
01:01:51,922 --> 01:01:57,325
same.
I mean, we would fight, and we'd

562
01:01:57,327 --> 01:02:02,397
fight like two kids with a ball.
And she'd rip through the house

563
01:02:02,399 --> 01:02:06,401
like she was on fire, and I'd
just want to hold her.

564
01:02:06,403 --> 01:02:08,403
I'd just want to hold her.

565
01:02:08,405 --> 01:02:10,471
But she'd be yelling and
flapping around so quick, it was

566
01:02:11,323 --> 01:02:16,624
like a hummingbird.
I'd say, "Ruth... "

567
01:02:17,515 --> 01:02:20,783
You can scream at me till your
voice is gone...

568
01:02:20,785 --> 01:02:24,420
But it doesn't make much
difference...

569
01:02:24,422 --> 01:02:28,157
Because when you're all done
screaming...

570
01:02:28,159 --> 01:02:33,128
"It's just gonna be you and me
sitting here in a room. "

571
01:02:33,130 --> 01:02:37,933
And she said, "that's right.
It's always just gonna be the"

572
01:02:37,935 --> 01:02:42,938
"two of us. "

573
01:02:52,361 --> 01:02:55,927
Look how pretty that is.
You like that?

574
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,336
Happy Birthday.

575
01:03:02,286 --> 01:03:07,826
Well, there's, uh, one
last... Surprise, I suppose.

576
01:03:08,566 --> 01:03:12,201
You know how to open these?

577
01:03:12,203 --> 01:03:15,872
All right. Let's open her up.
Yeah.

578
01:03:15,874 --> 01:03:19,943
Okay.
So, this was mine when I was

579
01:03:19,945 --> 01:03:23,213
about your size.
Let's see how it looks on you.

580
01:03:25,155 --> 01:03:28,415
Say hi to Ruth for me?
I'll tell her.

581
01:03:30,422 --> 01:03:34,090
I guess I hope I never see
you again.

582
01:03:46,413 --> 01:03:48,760
#... My love to the day

583
01:03:50,075 --> 01:03:55,478
# my precious little goodbye
# stay

584
01:04:02,087 --> 01:04:07,824
# well, I hollered up into the

585
01:04:07,826 --> 01:04:11,495
night #
# and I hollered up into the

586
01:04:11,497 --> 01:04:15,699
day #
# and from that big black hole

587
01:04:15,701 --> 01:04:20,805
come running down #
# back every word that I would

588
01:04:20,807 --> 01:04:26,477
say #
# forever mine has gone away

589
01:04:26,479 --> 01:04:31,248
# away

590
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:41,250
How's a dog sound? Ruff, ruff.

591
01:05:41,285 --> 01:05:43,555
Ruff, ruff? Try that.

592
01:05:43,557 --> 01:05:46,558
Ruff, ruff, and then go back

593
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:48,126
to cat.

594
01:05:48,128 --> 01:05:50,729
Try that.
# and some will travel 'cross

595
01:05:50,731 --> 01:05:53,565
the land, looking for their
love #

596
01:05:53,567 --> 01:05:55,200
One more time.

597
01:05:55,202 --> 01:06:01,173
# Others gaze upon the sea
and search the sky above #

598
01:06:01,175 --> 01:06:06,362
# But count me not among them
# as I was before

599
01:06:07,682 --> 01:06:13,619
# now I go wandering
# wandering no more

600
01:06:13,621 --> 01:06:17,723
# I shall go wandering no more,
my lord #

601
01:06:18,271 --> 01:06:23,280
# I shall go wandering no more
you are all the treasure #

602
01:06:25,258 --> 01:06:31,101
# That I've been searching for
# I shall go wandering no more

603
01:06:32,974 --> 01:06:36,976
# I shall go wandering no more

604
01:06:40,909 --> 01:06:44,504
Why don't you hang on to this?
Maybe in a week or so, I'll

605
01:06:44,752 --> 01:06:48,921
check back in with you, and
maybe you'll play me a song.

606
01:06:48,923 --> 01:06:50,823
How's that? No.

607
01:06:50,825 --> 01:06:54,126
No?
I'm going on a trip tomorrow.

608
01:06:54,128 --> 01:06:59,665
A trip? Is that right? Mm-hmm.

609
01:06:59,667 --> 01:07:05,606
She's great.

610
01:07:24,432 --> 01:07:29,007
You all right? Yeah, I'm fine.

611
01:09:51,127 --> 01:09:53,278
What are you doing here?

612
01:10:02,199 --> 01:10:06,067
Well, I didn't mean to wear
out my welcome.

613
01:10:06,578 --> 01:10:08,989
No. I just want to know.

614
01:10:11,797 --> 01:10:14,006
Just happy to be here.

615
01:10:15,733 --> 01:10:18,257
You're planning on leaving?

616
01:10:18,336 --> 01:10:20,470
Yes, I am. All right.

617
01:10:20,472 --> 01:10:26,009
You know where you're headed?
No, I don't know yet... just

618
01:10:26,011 --> 01:10:30,013
away from here.
Well, if you need any help...

619
01:10:30,015 --> 01:10:31,819
I don't need anything.

620
01:10:35,424 --> 01:10:37,827
I appreciate the invitation, and

621
01:10:38,206 --> 01:10:43,902
I bid you good night.
Good night.

622
01:11:08,454 --> 01:11:12,656
Ruth.

623
01:11:12,658 --> 01:11:18,128
I want to tell you something.
This has been, uh, weighing on

624
01:11:18,130 --> 01:11:23,567
me for some time.
Uh... When I was in the hospital,

625
01:11:23,569 --> 01:11:28,440
I wasn't, uh... I wasn't sitting
there making plans or anything.

626
01:11:29,942 --> 01:11:33,210
You know, I got nothing against
Bob.

627
01:11:33,212 --> 01:11:36,213
And what happened... I mean,
that's the risk.

628
01:11:36,215 --> 01:11:40,050
That's... that's part of my job.
And beyond that, I don't hold it

629
01:11:40,052 --> 01:11:43,320
against him to be who he was or
do what he was doing, and I

630
01:11:43,322 --> 01:11:46,924
still don't.
I'm glad to be alive.

631
01:11:46,926 --> 01:11:51,028
I'm glad to know you.
And if you weren't who you were

632
01:11:51,030 --> 01:11:55,734
and had never been with him and
somehow we had still come

633
01:11:56,325 --> 01:11:58,534
together right here, right now,

634
01:11:59,293 --> 01:12:01,583
I wouldn't feel any different.

635
01:12:04,008 --> 01:12:05,638
Do you understand?

636
01:12:08,928 --> 01:12:11,077
You remember that day?

637
01:12:11,112 --> 01:12:14,219
I remember getting shot.
I remember feeling like I'm

638
01:12:14,221 --> 01:12:18,123
getting punched in the shoulder,
seeing the big old Texas sky.

639
01:12:18,125 --> 01:12:22,093
I remember that, but, uh...
Did you see me?

640
01:12:22,095 --> 01:12:26,131
No, ma'am.
Did you hear what I said

641
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:32,037
after? I read your statement.

642
01:12:32,039 --> 01:12:36,041
It wasn't all true, you know.
I wasn't just a little girl who

643
01:12:36,043 --> 01:12:39,210
got dragged in over her head.
I knew what I was doing.

644
01:12:39,212 --> 01:12:44,583
Well... I think that, uh...

645
01:12:44,585 --> 01:12:50,188
A lot of things were said that
might not have been true.

646
01:12:50,190 --> 01:12:55,394
But you did what you did.
So did he.

647
01:12:55,396 --> 01:13:00,533
And whatever it is you've done,
when I see you with your

648
01:13:00,535 --> 01:13:04,670
daughter... All I see is good.

649
01:13:17,244 --> 01:13:19,354
Maybe I'm just fooling you.

650
01:13:22,665 --> 01:13:24,197
Are you?

651
01:14:27,475 --> 01:14:28,350
Ugh!

652
01:14:34,863 --> 01:14:38,799
Ugh!

653
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:47,174
Wait. Wait, God damn it!

654
01:15:35,925 --> 01:15:37,358
Ugh!

655
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:41,796
Ugh! Ugh!

656
01:15:57,043 --> 01:15:58,152
Ugh.

657
01:16:14,459 --> 01:16:15,815
God damn it.

658
01:16:16,550 --> 01:16:21,146
You shot me.
Why'd you shoot me?

659
01:16:25,093 --> 01:16:28,210
I've never even seen you.
No, sir.

660
01:16:28,212 --> 01:16:31,680
What's this about... money?

661
01:16:32,934 --> 01:16:37,673
You... it's about you.
You and the girl.

662
01:16:40,181 --> 01:16:42,349
Everything you tried to do.

663
01:16:48,486 --> 01:16:50,293
You gonna shoot me?

664
01:17:38,503 --> 01:17:41,066
I don't want you to think
I owe you anything.

665
01:17:41,853 --> 01:17:43,603
No, you don't.

666
01:17:43,638 --> 01:17:46,957
The only person I owe
anything to is Bob.

667
01:17:47,959 --> 01:17:49,640
That's not so.

668
01:17:52,734 --> 01:17:55,543
I've been storing
things up all this time...

669
01:17:58,060 --> 01:18:02,390
Sitting awake at night, thinking of
all the things I want to say to him.

670
01:18:03,719 --> 01:18:07,311
Except now I have so many
things, I don't know how I'd

671
01:18:07,313 --> 01:18:12,349
ever start.
All I had was Sylvie and I.

672
01:18:12,351 --> 01:18:15,653
I didn't know how to write about
her.

673
01:18:15,655 --> 01:18:20,958
How do you write about something
like that?

674
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:26,597
I remember the day she was born.
I was so scared, and I tried to

675
01:18:28,247 --> 01:18:30,888
keep her from coming, but she
came anyway.

676
01:18:33,372 --> 01:18:35,406
And when they put her in my
arms...

677
01:18:35,408 --> 01:18:37,808
Ugh!

678
01:18:37,810 --> 01:18:41,578
We just stared at one
another, and I thought I would

679
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:46,518
die from all that love.
And I tried to write to him

680
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:50,021
about it so he'd know what it
was like, but... but I just

681
01:18:50,023 --> 01:18:52,824
couldn't find the words to do it
right.

682
01:18:52,826 --> 01:18:56,962
So, I just stopped... stopped
writing to him.

683
01:18:56,964 --> 01:19:02,367
I figured that I'd just tell him
all at once when I saw him.

684
01:19:02,369 --> 01:19:06,404
He'd walk through the door, and
I'd know exactly what to say to

685
01:19:06,406 --> 01:19:09,374
him, and things would be the way
they used to be.

686
01:19:09,376 --> 01:19:13,378
That's why I've been saving
every little thing.

687
01:19:20,254 --> 01:19:22,717
And I haven't slept in four
years...

688
01:19:24,132 --> 01:19:29,555
And I'm tired.
I'm just so goddamn tired.

689
01:19:32,947 --> 01:19:34,644
Then rest.

690
01:19:36,921 --> 01:19:39,682
Will you wait with
me while I do?

691
01:20:09,246 --> 01:20:12,523
Are you all right? Okay?
Hey, what are you... what are you doing?

692
01:20:13,035 --> 01:20:14,498
Drive, man. Drive.

693
01:20:14,918 --> 01:20:16,575
Please, just take the keys.
Step on the gas, man!

694
01:20:16,577 --> 01:20:19,078
Step on the gas!

695
01:20:19,080 --> 01:20:20,813
All right.

696
01:20:20,815 --> 01:20:23,983
And just stick to the highway.
When you get to highway 6, you

697
01:20:23,985 --> 01:20:26,118
turn right.
I... I'm just trying to go see

698
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:28,254
my family, okay?
I'm just trying to get home.

699
01:20:28,256 --> 01:20:30,823
I ain't gonna put up a fight.
I'll do whatever you want.

700
01:20:30,825 --> 01:20:32,892
I just want to make sure I get
home to them.

701
01:20:32,894 --> 01:20:37,463
I just want you to drive.

702
01:20:37,465 --> 01:20:42,102
What's your family?

703
01:20:42,104 --> 01:20:47,541
What? What family have you got?

704
01:20:47,543 --> 01:20:52,612
You have a wife and kids? No.

705
01:20:52,614 --> 01:20:57,484
No, I'm going to see my parents.
Your parents?

706
01:20:57,486 --> 01:21:00,053
Mom and dad? Yeah.

707
01:21:00,055 --> 01:21:03,690
What's your name?

708
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:09,496
Will. Will's your name?

709
01:21:09,498 --> 01:21:13,100
Yeah.
Will, do you have anything to

710
01:21:13,102 --> 01:21:17,137
drink? No.

711
01:21:17,139 --> 01:21:19,906
You don't? Unh-unh.

712
01:21:19,908 --> 01:21:24,211
Shoot.
I could go for some water.

713
01:21:30,057 --> 01:21:32,590
You need to... you need to go

714
01:21:32,625 --> 01:21:35,989
to a hospital or something?
No, man.

715
01:21:35,991 --> 01:21:39,193
Just stay on the highway.
Turn at highway number 6.

716
01:21:39,195 --> 01:21:43,865
Yes, sir.

717
01:21:49,587 --> 01:21:53,370
Well, I guess you can
tell I got shot. Yep.

718
01:21:58,107 --> 01:22:00,081
These men came looking for me.

719
01:22:01,045 --> 01:22:06,889
They wanted to put me under.
Somebody sent them, and they

720
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:12,960
came from somewhere,
and they got me.

721
01:22:12,962 --> 01:22:18,733
They got me pretty good.
They didn't get me good enough.

722
01:22:25,108 --> 01:22:30,978
See... Ohh.

723
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:33,981
Tell your daddy who you gave a
ride to today.

724
01:22:34,628 --> 01:22:38,333
Okay. Who?

725
01:22:40,791 --> 01:22:45,661
What? Who are you?

726
01:23:45,357 --> 01:23:49,392
Hey!

727
01:23:49,394 --> 01:23:52,662
Drop it!

728
01:24:24,729 --> 01:24:29,232
It's all right.

729
01:24:29,234 --> 01:24:34,238
You remember...

730
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:38,709
Remember the first run you ever
did for me?

731
01:24:39,348 --> 01:24:43,464
Huh? Heh. You and Freddy.

732
01:24:45,253 --> 01:24:50,722
The very first one.
Nah, I never did nothing for you, sir.

733
01:25:00,358 --> 01:25:02,790
You both thought you were so
tough.

734
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:10,659
You were little boys.

735
01:25:18,671 --> 01:25:20,224
Ohh.

736
01:26:08,684 --> 01:26:12,739
I want to go home.
I was on the line with Morgan

737
01:26:13,373 --> 01:26:15,306
10 minutes ago... told him how
it happened.

738
01:26:15,308 --> 01:26:17,108
No, no, no.
You get 'em back on the phone

739
01:26:17,110 --> 01:26:19,244
'till they come down here.
I don't know who did what to

740
01:26:19,246 --> 01:26:20,812
who. Did you get an I.D. Yet?

741
01:26:20,814 --> 01:26:24,215
No.
I mean, yeah, but he was just

742
01:26:24,217 --> 01:26:25,984
some son of a bitch up near
burleson.

743
01:26:25,986 --> 01:26:30,361
Who knows?
Skerritt went out like a sucker, huh?

744
01:26:32,935 --> 01:26:34,627
I'm gonna take Ruth on home.

745
01:26:34,629 --> 01:26:39,799
No, I got Teddy doing that.
Yeah, I'm gonna take her.

746
01:27:01,468 --> 01:27:02,853
Wait here.

747
01:27:37,150 --> 01:27:41,893
It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

748
01:27:58,374 --> 01:28:00,141
I'm gonna call an ambulance.

749
01:28:05,698 --> 01:28:07,651
I've been waiting for you.

750
01:28:24,339 --> 01:28:27,608
Stop it. That tickles.
I thought that's what we're

751
01:28:28,183 --> 01:28:32,730
supposed to do... sing to 'em.
Just talk.

752
01:28:35,841 --> 01:28:40,005
Well...
Let me tell you about something.

753
01:28:41,291 --> 01:28:45,092
I'm gonna tell you about the
future.

754
01:28:45,094 --> 01:28:49,230
In the future, I'm a very old
man.

755
01:28:49,232 --> 01:28:54,468
And I'm standing in the door.
We're in a house.

756
01:28:54,992 --> 01:29:00,107
It's our house, somewhere far
away from here, where everything

757
01:29:00,510 --> 01:29:04,579
is green and the
sun is almost set.

758
01:29:04,581 --> 01:29:09,646
And where we're standing, the way I see it,
we're waving to somebody.

759
01:29:11,539 --> 01:29:14,090
And maybe that somebody is you,

760
01:29:15,692 --> 01:29:18,843
come to see us after
a long time gone.

761
01:29:21,504 --> 01:29:26,484
If it is you...
We are very happy to see you.

762
01:29:28,405 --> 01:29:30,739
Hey, sweetie.

763
01:29:59,026 --> 01:30:01,149
Tell me more about that house.

764
01:30:03,616 --> 01:30:05,394
I'm not talking to you.

765
01:30:07,694 --> 01:30:11,552
It's big... Maybe a farm.

766
01:30:12,860 --> 01:30:16,307
It's old. It's older than us.

767
01:30:19,310 --> 01:30:23,170
At the same time, though,
I feel like maybe I built it.

768
01:30:25,989 --> 01:30:27,719
There's no telling.

769
01:30:30,744 --> 01:30:33,267
There's just no telling.

770
01:33:29,870 --> 01:33:32,945
# Left your home at 23

771
01:33:33,616 --> 01:33:36,583
# suitcase full of gin

772
01:33:37,456 --> 01:33:40,687
