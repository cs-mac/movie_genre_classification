1
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,480
Hey, baby, what's going on there?

2
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,160
Oh, hi!

3
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,880
Miss Golightly!

4
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,000
Someday... Someday!

5
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,720
Miss Golightly!

6
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,200
You take off for the powder room.
That's the last I see you.

7
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,440
- Now, really, Harry...
- Harry was the other guy.

8
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,160
I'm Sid. Sid Arbuck.
You like me, remember?.

9
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,400
I protest!

10
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,800
Darling, I'm sorry, but I lost my key.

11
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,600
That was two weeks ago.

12
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,240
You cannot go on keep ringing my bell.

13
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,680
You disturb me!
You must have a key made!

14
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,800
It does no good. I lose them them all.

15
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,640
- Come on, baby, you like me.
- I worship you, Mr. Arbuck.

16
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,360
- Good night, Mr. Arbuck.
- Wait! What is this?

17
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,840
You like me. I'm a liked guy.

18
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,000
You like me. I picked up the check for five people...

19
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,560
... your friends. I've never seen them before.

20
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,320
When you asked for change for the powder room
I give you a $50 bill.

21
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,000
That gives me some rights.

22
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,600
In 30 seconds, I going to call the police!
All the time, a disturbance!

23
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,120
I get no sleep!

24
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,950
I got to get my rest! I'm an artist!

25
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:27,480
I going to call vice squad on you!

26
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,950
Don't be angry, dear man, I won't do it again.

27
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,200
And I might let you take those pictures.

28
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,240
When?

29
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,880
Sometime.

30
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,600
Anytime.

31
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,040
Good night.

32
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,240
I'm sorry to bother you.
But I couldn't get the downstairs door open.

33
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,120
I guess they sent me the upstairs key.

34
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,560
I couldn't get the downstairs door open.

35
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,560
I said, I guess they sent me...
Uh, upstairs key.

36
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,400
I couldn't get the downstairs door open.
Sorry to wake you.

37
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,680
That's quite all right.

38
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,880
It could happen to anyone...
Quite frequently does... Good night.

39
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,120
I... I hate to... uh...

40
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,040
I hate to bother you, but if I could ask
one more favor... could I use the phone?

41
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:45,240
- Sure. Why not?.
- Thank you.

42
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,920
Well, this is a...

43
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,120
... nice little place you've got here.

44
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,640
You just moved in, too, huh?

45
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,960
No. I've been here around a year.

46
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,360
The phone's over there.

47
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,040
Well, it was.

48
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,600
Oh, I remember.

49
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:06,400
I stuck it in the suitcase.
Kind of muffles the sound.

50
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,080
I'm... sorry.

51
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,560
Is he all right?

52
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,480
Sure, sure, he's OK.
Aren't you cat?

53
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,800
Poor old cat.

54
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,240
Poor slob.
Poor slob without a name.

55
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,160
I don't have the right to give him one.

56
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,760
We don't belong to each other.
We just took up one day.

57
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,640
I don't want to own anything,

58
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,880
until I find a place where me and things
go together.

59
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,200
I'm not sure where that is,
but I know what it's like.

60
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,800
It's like Tiffany's.

61
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,400
Tiffany's?
You mean the jewelry store?

62
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,280
That's right.

63
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,800
I'm crazy about Tiffany's.

64
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,360
Listen...
You know those days when you get the mean reds?

65
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,680
The mean reds? You mean, like the blues?

66
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,520
The blues are because you're getting fat or it's
been raining too long. You're just sad, that's all.

67
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,400
The mean reds are horrible.

68
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,320
Suddenly you're afraid,
and you don't know what you're afraid of.

69
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,200
- Don't get you ever get that feeling?
- Sure.

70
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,080
When I get it, what does any good,

71
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,680
is to jump into a cab and go to Tiffany's.

72
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,840
Calms me down right away.

73
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,040
The quietness, the proud look...

74
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,880
Nothing very bad could happen to you there.

75
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,400
If I could find a real-life place,

76
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,320
that made me feel like Tiffany's, then...

77
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,360
Then I'd buy some furniture
and give the cat a name.

78
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,480
I'm sorry. You wanted something
Oh, the telephone.

79
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,360
I'm supposed to meet somebody.

80
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,880
Isn't this 10:00 thursday morning?

81
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,670
I just go off a plane from Rome,
and I'm not too sure.

82
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:51,640
Thursday... Is this thursday?

83
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,120
- I think so.
- Thursday! It can't be!

84
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,080
It's too gruesome!

85
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,670
Well, uh... what's so gruesome about thursday?

86
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:04,400
Nothing, except I never remember
when it's coming up.

87
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,880
Wednesdays I generally just don't go to bed,

88
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,120
because I have to be up to catch the 10:45.

89
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,550
They're so particular about visiting hours.

90
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,400
Be a darling and look under the bed

91
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,720
for a pair of alligator shoes.

92
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,320
I've got to do something about
the way I look.

93
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,440
A girl can't go to Sing-Sing with a green face.

94
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,550
Sing-Sing?

95
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:30,240
I always thought it was a ridiculous
name for a prison. Sing-Sing, I mean.

96
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,550
Sounds more like an opera house, or something.

97
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,760
Black, alligator.

98
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:39,000
All the visitors make an effort
to look their best.

99
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,550
Actually, it's very touching,
all the women wearing their prettiest things.

100
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:45,640
I love them for it, and I love the kids.

101
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,550
It should be sad seeing kids there,
but it isn't.

102
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:53,320
They have ribbons in the hair
and lots of shine on their shoes.

103
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,760
As I understand it,

104
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,480
we're getting you ready
to visit somebody at Sing-Sing.

105
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,080
You could always tell what kind of a person
a man thinks you are

106
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,080
By the earrings he gives you.

107
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,000
I must say, the mind reels.

108
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,670
- May I ask whom?
- Whom I'm going to visit?

109
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,640
I guess that's what I mean.

110
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,840
I don't know that I should discuss it.

111
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,000
He never told me not to.

112
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,280
Cross your heart and kiss your elbow.

113
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,200
I'll try.

114
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,960
- You probably read about him, Sally Tomato
-Sally Tomato.

115
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,320
Don't look so shocked.

116
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,520
They couldn't prove he was in the Mafia,

117
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,440
much less head of it.

118
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,320
They only proved he cheated at his income taxi.

119
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,440
Anyway, he's a darling old man.

120
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,760
He wasn't my lover or anything.

121
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,080
I never knew him until after he was in prison.

122
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,790
I've gone to see him every thursday
for seven months.

123
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,480
I'd go even if he didn't pay me.

124
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,520
- Shoes.
- I could only find one.

125
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,400
- He pays you?
- His lawyer does.

126
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,120
If he's a lawyer, which I doubt.
He doesn't have an office.

127
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,920
Only an answering service.

128
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,920
He always wants to meet at hamburguer heaven.

129
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,640
There you are, you sneak. Thank you.

130
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,160
You're welcome.

131
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,480
Dress... Dress...

132
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,480
Here we are... Bag.
And a hat, too. There we are.

133
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,520
Anyway, about seven months ago,
this so called lawyer, Mr. O'Shaughnessy,

134
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,640
asked me how I'd like
to cheer up a lonely man

135
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,120
and pick up a hundred a week.

136
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,440
I told him: "Look darling,
you've got the wrong Holly Golightly."

137
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,160
I do as well on trips to the powder room.

138
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,120
Any gentleman will give $50
for the powder room.

139
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,320
And cab fare... that's another 50.

140
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,000
Then he said his client was Sally Tomato.

141
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,080
Sally had seen me somewhere,

142
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,240
and had admired me 'á la distance'.

143
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,160
So wouldn't it be a good deed
to visit him once a week?.

144
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,720
How could I say no?
It was wildly romantic.

145
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,840
How do I look?

146
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,240
Very good.
I must say I'm amazed.

147
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,800
I could never have done it without you.

148
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,640
- Bag...
- Call me anytime.

149
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,640
I'm just upstairs, or I will be
as soon as I get moved in.

150
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,160
Bye, cat.

151
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:16,560
Uh... you mean he gives you $100
for an hour's conversation?

152
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,680
Mr. O'Shaughnessy does when I meet him
and give him the weather report.

153
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,760
It's none of my business,
but it sounds like you could get in trouble.

154
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,680
Hold this for me.

155
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,560
And what do you mean weather report?

156
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,040
Just a message I give Mr. O'Shaughnessy,

157
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,320
so he knows I've really been up there.

158
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,240
Sally tells me things to say like, uh...

159
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,080
"There's a hurricane in Cuba"...

160
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,040
"Cloudy over Palermo"... things like that.

161
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,800
You don't have to worry.
I've taken care of myself a long time.

162
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,320
Taxi!

163
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,120
- I never could do that.
- It's easy.

164
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,320
Paul.

165
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,680
I'm late. I know it.

166
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,720
Where you locked out?
Didn't you get the key?

167
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,680
Oh, darling, I'm sorry.

168
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,760
No, I got the key, all right.

169
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,280
Miss Golightly, my neighbor, kindly let me in.

170
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,000
Miss Golightly on her way to Sing-Sing.

171
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,360
Just visiting, of course.

172
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,680
Miss Golightly,

173
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,280
Mrs. Falenson, my... decorator.

174
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,960
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

175
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,680
Oh, darling. Let me look at you.

176
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,960
- Are you through?
- Was the flight absolutely ghastly?

177
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,480
Grand Central Station.
And step on it, darling.

178
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,760
Is it really only three weeks
since I left you in Rome?

179
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,280
Seems like years.

180
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,040
- You seen the apartment?
- Not yet.

181
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,880
It was wicked of me, but I couldn't resist.

182
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,000
I fixed it up without you.

183
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,520
I think it's darling,

184
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:16,680
but if you absolutely hate it,
we can rip everything out and start from scratch.

185
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,800
Hey, baby! Where you going?

186
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,680
come on, baby. Open the door.

187
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,640
Aw, be a pal.

188
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,800
You're breaking up a beautiful party.

189
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,320
Come on, baby, open the door.

190
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,240
Hey, the band's swinging!

191
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,880
Aw, come on, baby.

192
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,840
Miss Gorightly!
Once again I must protest!

193
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,760
If you don't stop that phonograph now,

194
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,520
I'm going to call the Police Department!

195
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,480
Yeah. That more better.

196
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,880
What's the matter, baby?

197
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,120
Aw, come on. You're a great kid.
Open the door.

198
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,080
Come on, baby. I'm waiting for you.

199
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,040
- It's all right, it's only me.
- Uh, wait a minute. Miss, uh...

200
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,160
Golightly. Holly Golightly.

201
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,800
I live downstairs.
We met this morning, remember?

202
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,280
Yeah.

203
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,840
It's all right. She's gone.

204
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,840
She works late hours for a decorator.

205
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,360
There's the most terrifying man downstairs.

206
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,240
He's sweet when he isn't drunk, but...

207
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,280
Let him start lapping up the 'vino'
and, oh, golly, 'quel' beast!

208
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,400
It got so tiresome, I went out the window.

209
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,000
You can throw me out if you want,

210
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,040
but you looked so cozzy in here
and your decorator friend had gone home,

211
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,590
and it was getting so cold
on the fire scape.

212
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:10,560
And I always heard people in New York

213
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,400
never get to know their neighbors.

214
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,680
Well, how was Sing-Sing?

215
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,880
Fine. I made the train and everything.

216
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,880
And what's the weather report?

217
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,640
"Small-craft warnings,"

218
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,680
"Block lsland to Hatteras."
Whatever that means.

219
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,920
You know, you're so sweet.
You really are

220
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:39,240
And you look a little like my brother, Fred.

221
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,160
- Do you mind if I call you Fred?
- Not at all.

222
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,640
300. She's very generous.

223
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,920
Is that by the week, the hour, or what?

224
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,400
The party is over. Out.

225
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,680
Oh, Fred.
Darling Fred, I'm sorry.

226
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,830
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
Don't be angry.

227
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,480
I was just letting you know I understand.

228
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,920
I understand completely.

229
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,520
Stick around. Make yourself a drink.

230
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,830
- Or throw me my robe, I'll make you one.
-Stay where you are.

231
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:14,520
You must be absolutely exhausted.

232
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,040
I mean, it's late,

233
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,960
and you were sound asleep and everything.

234
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,720
I suppose you think I'm very brazen
or 'trés fou' or something.

235
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,640
You're no fouer than anybody else.

236
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,520
Yes, you do. Everybody does.
And I don't mind.

237
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,720
It's useful being top banana
in the shock department

238
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,560
What do you do, anyway?

239
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:41,160
- I'm a writer, I guess.
- You guess? Don't you know?

240
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,280
OK, positive statement.
Ringing affirmative.

241
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,160
I'm a writer.

242
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,640
The only writer I've been out with
is Benny Shacklett.

243
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,800
He's written an awful lot of TV stuff,
but 'quel' rat!

244
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,280
Tell me. Are you a real writer?

245
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,280
I mean, does anybody buy what you write
or publish it or anything?

246
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,440
They bought what's in that box.

247
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,590
Yours?

248
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,160
All these books?

249
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:12,680
There's just one book,
12 copies of it.

250
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,160
"Nine lives" by Paul Varjak.

251
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,520
- They're stories.
- Hmm... Nine of them.

252
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,280
Tell me one.

253
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,680
They're not the kind of stories
you can really tell.

254
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,830
Too dirty?

255
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,160
Yeah, I... suppose they're dirty too,

256
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,960
but only incidentally.

257
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,640
Mainly they're angry, sensitive...
intensively felt,

258
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,920
and that dirtiest of all dirty words...
Promising.

259
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:45,000
So said The Times Book Review
October 1, 1956.

260
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,280
- 1956?
- That's right.

261
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,720
This is kind of a ratty question,
but what have you written lately?

262
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:56,680
Lately, I've been working on a novel.

263
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:59,720
- Lately, since 1956?
- A novel takes a long time.

264
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,280
- I want it exactly right.
- So, not more stories.

265
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:08,280
The idea is I'm supposed to not fritter
my talent on little things.

266
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,960
I'm supposed to be saving it
for the big one.

267
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,110
Do you write every day??

268
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,480
Sure.

269
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,960
- Today?
- Sure.

270
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,240
- It's a beautiful typewriter.
- Of course.

271
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,350
It writes nothing but sensitive,
intensely felt promising prose.

272
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:26,720
- There's no ribbon in it.
- There isn't?

273
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,880
No.

274
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,400
Something you said this morning
has been bothering me all day.

275
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,000
What's that?

276
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,350
Do they really give you $50
whenever you go to the powder room?

277
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:44,110
Of course.

278
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,480
You must do very well.

279
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,640
I'm trying to save,
but I'm not very good at it.

280
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,960
You know? You do look
a lot like my brother Fred.

281
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:02,350
I haven't seen him since I was 14.
That's when I left home.

282
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:05,800
He was already 6'2".

283
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:08,960
It must have been the peanut butter
that did it.

284
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,040
Everybody thought he was dotty,
the way he gorged himself on peanut butter.

285
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,760
But he wasn't dotty,

286
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:19,680
just sweet and vague and...
terribly slow.

287
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,960
Poor Fred.
He is in the Army now.

288
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,400
That's really the best place for him
until I can get enough money saved.

289
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,880
- And then?
- And then Fred and I...

290
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,760
I went to Mexico once.

291
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,040
It's a wonderful place for racing horses.

292
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:44,110
I saw one place near the sea that...

293
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:46,880
Fred's very good with horses.

294
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,880
Even land in Mexico costs something.

295
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:55,080
No matter what I do, there's never
more than $200 in the bank.

296
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,040
It can't be 4:30.

297
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,480
It just can't.

298
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:08,320
Do you mind if I just get in
with you for a minute?

299
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,160
It's allright. Really, it is.

300
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,480
We're friends, that's all.

301
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,480
- We are friends, aren't we?
- Sure.

302
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:35,520
OK, let's don't say another word.

303
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,920
Let's just go to sleep.

304
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,080
Where are you, Fred?

305
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,480
It's cold.

306
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,760
There... There's snow in the wind.

307
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,960
What is it? What's the matter?

308
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,080
Why are you crying?

309
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,400
If we're going to be friends,
let's just get one thing straight right now.

310
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,400
I hate snoops.

311
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:26,320
- Yeah.
- Lucille, darling?

312
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,920
I've been trying desperately to reach you.

313
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,800
Bill just got back...

314
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,600
A day early, the beast...

315
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,040
So, I'm afraid I'll have to beg off.

316
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,160
You'll explain to the rest of the girls?

317
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,960
You are a darling.

318
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,440
Maybe we can have a long lunch tomorrow.

319
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,720
- I'll phone you in the morning.
- Whatever you say.

320
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,560
You'll manage to survive without me tonight?

321
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:55,360
Sure. I might even take
a wild boyish flying at writing.

322
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,640
- Good night.
- Good night.

323
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,840
Got yourself stuffed,
huh, Polly, baby?

324
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,760
Serves you right, bigmouth.

325
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,080
'Buon giorno'.

326
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,000
Aren't you drinking?

327
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,920
You have pockets there or something?
What do you go by?

328
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,760
What's your name? What do you call yourself?

329
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,000
- Irving.
- Oh, yes. Perfect, perfect.

330
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,560
That's wonderful.

331
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,760
I'll be right back, Irving, baby.

332
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,880
Kid's still in the shower.
You expected?

333
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,120
I was invited. That what you mean?

334
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,960
Don't get all tense and soft. Come in.

335
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,680
It's a party.
Lot of characters come who aren't expected.

336
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,120
I'll buy you a drink.

337
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,000
- You drink?
- Yeah.

338
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,280
- Then I'll buy you a drink. - OK.

339
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,760
Hey, honey, your skirt's split here.

340
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,280
- What do you drink?
- Bourbon.

341
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,000
- Bourbon... on the rocks?
- Yeah... No, with water.

342
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,320
- You want rocks first?
- Yeah. Not too much.

343
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,680
All right. That'll set you free.

344
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:35,560
- Know the kid long?
- Not very. I live upstairs.

345
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:39,360
Look at this place. What a place
It's unbelievable. What a dump!

346
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,840
What do you think?

347
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,280
- About what?
- Is she or isn't she?

348
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,400
Wait a minute. Hold it.

349
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,280
- Harriet!
- Hi, J.B.

350
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,640
"J.B."? What's that?

351
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,480
- You know Gil.
- Yeah. How are you?

352
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,840
- How about a drink?
- In the kitchen. You'll find everything you need.

353
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,920
So... Oh, honey, that is you.

354
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,560
Fred, darling, I'm so glad you could come!

355
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,200
I brought you a house present.
Something for the bookcase.

356
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,960
Oh, you're sweet.

357
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,880
Doesn't that look nice?
Give me a cigarette, O.J.

358
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,680
-Sure, sure...
- O.J.'s a great agent.
He knows a lot of phone numbers.

359
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,640
What's Jerry Wald's phone number?

360
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,160
Come on, lay off.

361
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,040
Darling, I want you to call him and
tell him what a genious Fred is.

362
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,240
Stop blushing, Fred.
You didn't say it, a genious, I did.

363
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,800
So, quit stalling, O.J. Just tell me
what are you going to do to make Fred
rich and famous.

364
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,600
Let Fred and me settle that.
Huh, puppy?

365
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,880
OK, but just remember... I'm the agent.

366
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,720
He's already got a decorator.
I'm the agent.

367
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,120
Hold it.

368
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,160
Hi, boys. Come on in.

369
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,440
Everything you need's in the kitchen.

370
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,520
So, listen, Fred, baby... What...?

371
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,560
- No, it's Paul, baby.
- I thought it was Fred, baby.
- No.
- Oh, it is. I thought it was Paul, baby...

372
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,560
- Answer the question. Is she or isn't she?
- Is she or isn't she what?

373
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,000
A phony.

374
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,600
I don't know. I don't think so.

375
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,800
You don't, huh? Well, you're wrong... She is.

376
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:10,680
But on the other hand you're right,
because she's a real phony. You know why?

377
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,600
Because she honestly believes
all this phony junk.

378
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,240
Now, I sincerely like the kid. I do.

379
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,960
I'm sensitive, that's why.

380
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,680
You got to be sensitive to like the kid.
You know what I mean.

381
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,960
It's a streak of the poet.
You know what I mean.

382
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,480
You know her long?

383
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,240
I discovered her, I'm O.J. Berman
She was just a kid...

384
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,000
Lot of style and class, you know...

385
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,960
- Lot of what?
- Class. Yes, she had a lot of class.

386
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,560
But when she opened the mouth you didn't
know what she was talking about...
Whether she was a
hillbilly or an okie.

387
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,360
- Know how long it took to me
to smooth that accent?
- No.
- I'll tell you how long.

388
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,280
One year. Know how we did?
We gave her french lessons.

389
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,600
Figured once she could imitate french,

390
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,120
she could imitate english.

391
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,000
Finally, I arranged
for a little screen test.

392
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,120
Well, the night before the screen...
I've got to kill myself...
The night before the screen, the phone rings,
I pick it up...

393
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:00,200
"This is O.J., speak" and she says: "Hi, this is Holly"
"Holly, you sound far away".
And she says: "I'm in New York."

394
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,800
"you can't be in New York.
You have a screen test tomorrow."

395
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,880
She says: "I'm in New York because I've
never been in New York before"
"Get yourself in a plane! Get back!"
She says: "I don't want to."

396
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,560
"What do you mean?
What do you want?"
She says: "That's what you want."

397
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:14,040
And she says: "when I find out, I'll let you know."
Bang!

398
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,560
- So look, Fred, baby...
- It's Paul, baby.

399
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:19,800
Sure.
Don't tell me she isn't a phony.

400
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,680
Irving, honey, where you been?

401
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,160
Mike, darling, I tried reaching you
all day long.

402
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,080
Your answering service doesn't answer.

403
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:47,800
That's the trouble with answering services...

404
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,160
Well, I guess that's... and after all that she said...

405
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,760
- Time, darling.
- What?

406
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,760
Time?

407
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,880
- You have a watch?
- No.

408
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,520
- Oh, let's see. 18:45.
- Thank you.

409
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,760
Really, was that necessary?

410
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:46,440
This is some party.
Who are all these people, anyhow?

411
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,720
who knows? The word gets out.

412
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,840
You don't mind, don't you, darling?

413
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,200
Reinforcements.

414
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,240
Right in there.

415
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,720
Holly?

416
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,120
Holly, darling!

417
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:22,400
- What's that?
- Mag Wildwood.

418
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:26,320
She is a model, believe it or not,
and a thumping bore.

419
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,760
But just look at the goodies
she brought with her.

420
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,360
He's all right,

421
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,720
if you like dark, handsome,
rich-looking men

422
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,080
with passionate natures and too many teeth.

423
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,160
I mean the other one.

424
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,840
- the other one?
- He's Rusty Trawler.

425
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,880
The ninth richest man in America
under 50.

426
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:56,240
Now, that, indeed, is a remarkable piece
of information to have at your fingerprints.

427
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,640
I keep track of this things.

428
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:03,320
- Excuse me. you owe me 47...
- Hold this a minute, darling.

429
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,920
Mag, darling, what are you doing here?

430
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,400
I was upstairs working with Yunioshi...

431
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,680
Easter stuff for The Bazaar.

432
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,520
then these two nice boys came
to pick me up.

433
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,960
It was a mistake, of course.
My wires get crossed somewhere.

434
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,880
They were both very sweet about it.

435
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,160
May I present
José Silva Pereira?

436
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,560
He's from Brazil... Miss Golightly...

437
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,960
Very kind of you, Miss Golightly,
to allow me to attend your party.

438
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,040
I'm so interested in north-american culture.

439
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,920
I've been already to the Statue of Liberty

440
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,840
and to the Restaurant Automatique.

441
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:45,320
But this is the first time

442
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,200
I am in a typical north-americansom home.

443
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,480
Wouldn't he just melt in your mouth?

444
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,400
And this is Mr. Rusty Trawler.

445
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,240
You're not vexed at me for bringing him?

446
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,760
- Of course not, darling.
- I'm glad.

447
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,640
Now, who's going to bring me a bourbon?

448
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,760
- O.J.
- Yeah.

449
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,880
Would you get Miss Wildwood a drink?

450
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,240
which one's Miss Wildwood?

451
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,280
Mr. Berman, we haven't been formally introduced,

452
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:14,120
but I'm Mag Wildwood from Wildwood, Arkansas.

453
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,440
That's...hill country.

454
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,320
Now, you just make yourself righ at home.

455
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,840
Oh, don't trouble yourself.

456
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,120
I'm contented to observe the customs
of your country.

457
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,640
OK, you do that.

458
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,560
Now come along, Mr. Trawler.

459
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,360
Let's see what we can find
to amuse you.

460
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,360
I wasn't supposed to pick you up.

461
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,960
You said you would...

462
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,670
I wasn't supposed to pick you up.

463
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,560
Miss Golightly?

464
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,280
This time I'm awarning you!

465
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:00,400
I am definitely this time
going to call the police!

466
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:19,280
Good evening!

467
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,600
Is it something important?

468
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:24,440
No. Just the guy upstairs complaining
about the noise.

469
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,840
He's angry?

470
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,560
He did mention something about
calling the police.

471
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,040
Oh, the police... The police?

472
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,640
That i cannot have. I'd better look
for Miss Wildwood and go.

473
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,440
To think I'd find a beau of mine

474
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,320
mousing after a piece of
cheap Hollywood trash.

475
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,560
Mag, darling, you're being a bore.

476
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,440
Shut up!

477
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,710
You know what's going to happen you?

478
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:56,190
I'm going to march you over the zoo
and feed you to the yak...

479
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:58,960
Just as soon as I finish this drink.

480
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,520
Timber!

481
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,320
Sorry.

482
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,600
- Oh, good evening, Ed.
- It's Paul, baby.

483
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,960
You remember Irving, don't you?

484
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:48,000
- This is José.
- Nice to meet you.

485
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,360
Wonderful seeing you.

486
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,800
Jewel thieves.

487
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,280
Sally helps me with my accounts.

488
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,920
I have no head for figures at all.

489
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,600
I'm trying desperately to save some money.

490
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,360
I just can't seem to.

491
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,190
He makes me write down
everything in here.

492
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:31,360
What I get, what I spend.

493
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,710
I used to have a checking account.
He made me get rid of that.

494
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:40,840
He feels, for me, it's better to operate
on a cash basis, taxwise.

495
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,670
Someday Mr. Fred, you take this book,
turn it to a novel.

496
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:49,480
Everything is there.
Just fill in the details.

497
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,280
Would be good for some laughs.

498
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,560
No. No, I don't think so.

499
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,440
This is a book would break that heart.

500
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:00,120
"Mr. Fitzsimmons...
powder room, $50."

501
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:05,600
"Less $18... Repair one black satin dress."

502
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,840
"Cat food, 27 cents."

503
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:11,840
Sally, darling, please stop.
You're making me blush!

504
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:15,120
But you're right about Jack Fitzsimmons.
He's an absolute rat.

505
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,600
But I guess, of course,
I don't know anybody but rats.

506
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,920
Except, of course, Fred here.

507
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,840
You do think Fred is nice, don't you?

508
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:27,360
For you... I hope he is.

509
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:40,560
Give me a kiss, goodbye, uncle Sally.
Till next week.

510
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,920
Goodbye, uncle Sally.

511
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,600
Goodbye, and don't forget to send that book.

512
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,670
I won't.

513
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:49,840
Oh, what about the weather report?

514
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,840
Oh, yes.

515
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:54,710
"Snow flurries expected this weekend
in New Orleans."

516
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:02,920
Snow flurries expected this weekend
in New Orleans?

517
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,760
Isn't that just the weirdest?

518
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:08,600
I bet they haven't had snow in
New Orleans for a million years.

519
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,190
I don´t know how he thinks them up.

520
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,560
- What you doing?
- Writing.

521
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,880
Good.

522
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,080
Well, hello.

523
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:14,000
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

524
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,280
It's probably nothing.

525
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,480
I wnat to see if he's still there.

526
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:23,230
See if who's still there?
What are you talking about?

527
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,120
Look.

528
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:37,080
See?
I noticed him yesterday afternoon.

529
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,320
I didn't say anything.
I didn't want to sound neurotic, but...

530
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:44,360
- When he's there again today...
- Who do you think he is?

531
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,670
It could be anybody, of course,

532
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:49,120
But what crossed my mind was...

533
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:52,230
Suppose Bill's having us watched, huh?

534
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,000
OK, I'll take care of this.

535
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:01,360
No. No, don't. Please.

536
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:04,120
If that's what it is, you'll only
make everything worse.

537
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,800
I'll be careful. Wait here.

538
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,670
Darling, please don't.
I don't think you should.

539
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:10,120
Now, take it easy.

540
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:13,760
I just want to find out
what this is all about.

541
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,400
All right, what do you want?

542
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,320
Son, I need a friend.

543
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,880
That's me, that's her,

544
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,080
that's her brother, Fred.

545
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,320
You are Holly's father?

546
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,000
Her name ain't Holly.

547
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,160
She was Lula Mae Barnes,

548
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,120
was till she married me.

549
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,960
I'm her husband, Doc Golightly.

550
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:39,160
Paul Varjak.

551
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,960
I'm a horse doctor. Animal man.

552
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,840
Do some farming, too,
near Tulip, Texas.

553
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:50,000
Her brother Fred's getting out
of the Army soon.

554
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,480
Lula Mae belong home with her husband,
and her children.

555
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,560
children?

556
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,920
- Them's her children.
- She's got four children?

557
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:03,080
Now, son, I didn't claim they was
her natural-born children.

558
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,680
Their own precious mother...
Precious woman...

559
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:10,080
Passed away July 4th,
Independence Day, 1955.

560
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:13,840
The year of the drought. When I married
Lula Mae, she was going on 14.

561
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:18,640
You might think the average person
going 14 wouldn't know her own mind.

562
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:21,120
But you take Lula Mae,

563
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,120
she was an exceptional person.

564
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:31,920
She just plumb broke our hearts
when she run off like she done.

565
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,280
Just plain had no reason.

566
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:37,200
All the housework was done
by our daughters.

567
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,280
Lula Mae could just take it easy.

568
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,080
That woman got positively fat,

569
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:45,720
while her brother, he growed up into a giant,

570
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,320
which is a sight different
from the way they come to us.

571
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:52,200
A couple of wild young'uns, they was.

572
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,680
I caught'em stealing milk
and turkey eggs.

573
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:58,360
They'd been living with some mean,
no-account people

574
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,840
about 100 mile east of Tulip.

575
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,400
She had good cause to run off
from that house.

576
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,520
Never had none to leave mine.

577
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,120
What about her brother?
Didn't he leave too?

578
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,520
No. We had Fred with us till
the Army took him.

579
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,040
That's why I come.

580
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,000
I had a letter from him.
He's getting out in february.

581
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,240
That's why I come to get her.

582
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:25,040
Lula Mae's place is with her husband
her children, and her brother.

583
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,480
The prize from the cracker jack.
Want it?

584
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,480
Never could understand
why that woman run off.

585
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:37,080
Don't tell me she weren't happy.

586
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:39,360
Talky as a jaybird, she was,

587
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:42,240
with something smart to say
on every subject.

588
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,840
Better than the radio.

589
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:47,040
The night I proposed,
I cried like a baby.

590
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,960
She said: "Why are you crying?
Of course we'll be married."

591
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:53,360
"I never been married before."

592
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,240
I laughed and hugged and squeezed her.

593
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,400
"Never been married before."

594
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,360
Listen, son, I advise you,
I need a friend,

595
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:09,400
'cause I don't want to surprise her
or scare her none.

596
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,640
Be my friend, let her know I'm here.

597
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,200
Will you do that for me, son?

598
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,960
Yeah, sure, Doc.
If that is what you want.

599
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,640
Come on.

600
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,240
All right.

601
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,840
Coming.

602
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,200
Oh, darling, I'm on my way out.

603
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,960
I'm half an hour late.

604
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,400
Maybe we can have a drink tomorrow.

605
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,840
Sure, Lula Mae...

606
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,160
If you're still here tomorrow.

607
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,720
Oh, please, where is he?

608
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:26,840
Honey, don't they feed you up here?
You're so skinny.

609
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:35,560
- Hi, Doc.
- Gosh, Lula Mae...

610
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,200
Kingdom come!

611
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,160
What's the matter? You all right?

612
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:41,880
I guess so... No, I'm not.
Will you help me?

613
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:45,120
- If I can.
- Come to the bus station with Doc and me.

614
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,120
He still thinks I'm going back.

615
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:50,680
- I can't play the scene alone
What can I do?
- He's your husband.

616
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:53,640
- No, he's not.
- He's not?

617
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:56,640
It was annulled ages ago.
He just won't accept it.

618
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,680
Please, Fred.
I'll say you're seeing us off.

619
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:01,120
Don't say anything.

620
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:06,320
Just meet us out front,
in about an hour. Please?

621
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,920
You wait right here, honey.
I'll get the bag.

622
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,800
Why don't I get some magazines?.

623
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:22,440
Please, Fred, don't leave me.

624
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,240
Attention, please...

625
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,720
Leaving from platform 5,
through coach to Dallas...

626
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,400
Philadelphia, Columbus,
lndianapolis, Terre Haute,

627
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:32,680
St. Louis, Tulsa,
Oklahoma City, Denison, Dallas.

628
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,840
Come on, Lula Mae. That's us.

629
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:37,000
Doc, I'm not coming with you.

630
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Come on. Let's walk quietly.

631
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,240
I'll try and help you understand.
Help me, Fred.

632
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:46,760
I appreciate you want to help, but
it's between Lula Mae and me.

633
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,080
Sure, Doc.

634
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,640
I love you, Lula Mae.

635
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,640
I know, and that's the trouble.

636
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:59,080
It's a mistake you always made...
trying to love a wild thing.

637
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:02,200
You were always lugging home
wild things...

638
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,200
A hawk with a broken wing,

639
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:07,560
a full grown wildcat
with a broken leg...

640
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:10,080
- Remember?
- There's something...

641
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:12,520
You mustn't give your heart
to a wild thing.

642
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,960
The more you do,
the stronger they get

643
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,680
until they're strong enough
to fly into a tree,

644
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,160
then to higher trees,
then to the sky.

645
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,760
There's something I got to tell you.

646
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,000
Excuse me.

647
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,640
Couple of weeks ago,
I got a letter from Fred.

648
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:28,760
From Fred? He's all right, isn't he?

649
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:31,040
Yeah, he's fine, I guess.

650
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,960
He's getting out of the Army
in february.

651
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,840
In february?

652
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:38,320
Well, that's only foor months.

653
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:42,480
So, see, you got to come back,
your place is with us.

654
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,200
Doc, you've got to understand.
I can't come back.

655
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:47,560
You got to understand what I'm saying.

656
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:50,760
I don't want to pressure you,
but it got to.

657
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:54,040
If you don't come
I'll have to tell young Fred

658
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,400
he better sign up for another hitch.

659
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,440
Don't do that.
Don't write that to him.

660
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,360
I'll write him and say I want
him with me.

661
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,800
I'll take care of him.

662
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,440
You're talking crazy, Lula Mae.

663
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:08,640
Doc, stop calling me that.
I'm not Lula Mae anymore.

664
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,680
All right, Lula Mae.

665
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:19,640
I guess you know what you're doing.

666
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,480
Keep an eye on her, will you, son?

667
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,760
At least see she eats something
once in a while.

668
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,080
Sure, Doc.

669
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,320
So skinny.

670
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,800
Please, Doc. Please understand.

671
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:03,680
I love you, but I'm just
not Lula Mae anymore.

672
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,040
I'm not.

673
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,800
You know the terrible thing,
Fred, darling?

674
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:50,280
I am still Lula Mae...
14 years old, stealing turkey eggs

675
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:53,000
and running through a briar patch.

676
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:59,040
Except now I call it
having the mean reds.

677
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:08,680
Well, it's still too early
to go to Tiffany's.

678
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,760
I guess the next best thing
is a drink.

679
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,640
Yes, I very much need a drink.

680
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:17,880
- Buyme one, Fred, darling?
- Sure.

681
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:23,200
Only promise me one thing...
Don't take me home until I'm drunk...

682
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,040
Until I'm very drunk, indeed.

683
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:05,420
Do you think she's talented?
Deeply and importantly talented?

684
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:10,180
No. Amusingly and superficially
talented, yes...

685
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:14,260
But deeply and importantly talented, no.

686
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:37,180
Gracious.

687
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:40,420
Do you think she's handsomely paid?

688
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:45,220
Oh, indeed.

689
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:48,540
Well, let me tell you something.

690
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:52,020
If I had her money, I'd be
richer than she is.

691
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:55,860
- How do oyu figure that?
- Because I keep the candy store.

692
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:59,100
Old Sally Tomato...
That's my candy store.

693
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:01,220
I'd always keep Sally.

694
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:04,220
That's why I'd be
richer than she is.

695
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:08,980
We'd better get a little more air.

696
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:19,340
Tom, Dick and Harry...

697
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:20,780
No. Correction.

698
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:24,100
Every Tom, Dick, and Sid...
Harry was his friend.

699
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:27,020
Anyway, every Tom, Dick,
and Sid sinks...

700
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:29,340
Thinks if he takes a girl to dinner,

701
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:33,860
she'll just curl up in a little
furry ball at his feet, right?

702
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:36,580
I have by actual count
been taken to dinner

703
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:40,420
by 26 different rats in the last 2 months.

704
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:42,540
27, if you count Benny Shacklett,

705
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:45,220
who's in many ways a super-rat.

706
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:49,420
- I forgot my key.
- Nevermind. I just buzzed Yunioshi.

707
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:51,540
Do you want to know
something funny?

708
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:55,420
In spite of the fact most of
these rats fork up $50

709
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:58,740
for the powder room
like little dolls...

710
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:02,460
I find I have $9 less
in the bank account

711
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:05,380
than I had six months ago.

712
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:07,500
So, my darling Fred,

713
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:10,740
I have tonight made
a very serious decision.

714
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:13,220
And what is that?

715
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:16,100
No longer will I play the field.

716
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:18,820
- Congratulations.
- The field stinks...

717
00:58:18,820 --> 00:58:21,660
both economically and socially,

718
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:23,580
and I'm giving it up.

719
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:29,340
This time I'm calling the police,
the Fire Department

720
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:31,300
and New Yorks State Housing Comission,

721
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:33,580
and, if necessary, the Board of Health!

722
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:38,060
Quiet up there.
You want to wake the whole house?

723
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:39,580
As Miss Golightly was saying

724
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:42,860
before she was so rudely interrupted.

725
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:46,180
Miss Golightly further announces her intention

726
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:49,100
to devote her not
inconsiderable talents

727
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:50,820
to the inmediate capture,

728
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:55,620
for the purpose of matrimony,
of Mr. Rutherford...

729
00:58:55,620 --> 00:59:02,540
Rusty, to his friends, of whom,
I'm sure he has many... Trawler.

730
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:05,780
- Who?
- Rusty Trawler.

731
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:09,980
You met him at a party.
He came with Mag Wildwood,

732
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:12,500
not the beautiful latin type,

733
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:16,420
the other one...the one that
looks like a pig.

734
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:17,860
Remember?

735
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:21,820
The 9th richest man
in America under 50?

736
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:30,540
Do I detect a look of disaproval? In your eye?

737
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:34,340
Tough beans, buddy, 'cause
that's the way it's going to be.

738
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:36,020
Hi, cat.

739
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:39,660
- Holly, you're drunk.
- True.

740
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:43,500
Absolutely true.
True, but irrelevant.

741
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,420
What are you doing?

742
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:47,980
So I think we should
have a drink,

743
00:59:47,980 --> 00:59:52,260
to the new Mrs. Rusty Trawler... Me.

744
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:54,100
Hey, take it easy.

745
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:57,340
What's the matter?
Don't you think I can do it?

746
00:59:57,340 --> 01:00:00,900
Tell me, I'm interested.
Don't you think I can?

747
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:02,620
You heard the Doc.

748
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:04,460
My brother gets out in february.

749
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:08,140
The Doc won't take him back.
It's all up for me.

750
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:11,140
I don't know why you don't understand.

751
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:15,780
I need money, and I'll do
whatever I have to do to get it.

752
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:18,260
So... This time next month,

753
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:21,620
I'll be the new Mrs. Rusty Trawler.

754
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:26,540
I think we should have
a little drink to that.

755
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:29,620
It's all gone. Isn't that too bad?

756
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:33,820
Got any whiskey upstairs?

757
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:36,660
But you've had enough.

758
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:39,220
Go ahead. Get the whiskey.

759
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:41,620
I'll pay you for it.

760
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:44,980
Holly, please.

761
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:49,020
No, no, you disappove of me,
and I do not accept drinks

762
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,260
from gentlemen who disapprove of me.

763
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:54,860
I'll pay for my own whiskey.
Don't forget it.

764
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:56,260
Holly.

765
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:59,820
I do not accept drinks
from disapproving gentlemen.

766
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:01,820
Specially not disapproving gentlemen

767
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:05,980
who are kept by other ladies.
So take it.

768
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:09,620
You should be used to taking
money from ladies by now.

769
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:18,420
I I were you, I'd be more
careful with my money.

770
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:22,340
Rusty Trawler is too hard
a way of earning it.

771
01:01:23,860 --> 01:01:26,780
It should take you exactly 4 seconds

772
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:30,020
to cross from here to that door.

773
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:31,620
I'll give you two.

774
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:47,460
Hi. I wanted to talk about
the other night,

775
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:50,380
then I saw the paper, and...

776
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:53,580
Well, actually, I'm kind of
embarrased about it,

777
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:55,540
but since it oncerns you,

778
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:58,420
I thought I should talk
about it in person.

779
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:00,860
- What?
- what?

780
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:05,340
Oh. The earplugs.

781
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:07,380
I can't go through the whole thing again.

782
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:10,300
It's sufficient to say,
I've come to make up.

783
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:13,340
As an added inducement,
I have all kind of news.

784
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:16,420
- Can come on in?
- I guess so.

785
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:19,700
Just a  minute.
Do I have a nightgown on?

786
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:22,780
No, I don't.
Would you turn around for a second?

787
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:27,100
Never mind. That's corny anyway.
I'll turn around myself.

788
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:28,420
Come in.

789
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:32,540
Have... you seen the paper?

790
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:35,980
Mmm. Rusty, you mean?

791
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:38,020
Yes. I know all about it.

792
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:41,380
Certainly had him...
Pegged wrong, didn't it?

793
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:43,860
I thought he was just a rat,

794
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:46,540
but he was a super-rat all along.

795
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:49,260
A super-rat in rat's clothing.

796
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:51,740
You don't even know the best part.

797
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:56,500
Not only was a super-rat,
he was also broke.

798
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:59,780
Broke! I mean, but not a farthing.

799
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:03,220
His family has money, of course,
but he personally is broke.

800
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:06,860
It turns out he owes $700,000.

801
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:10,700
Can you imagine anyone owing $700000?

802
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:13,220
$43, yes.

803
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:15,540
Anyway, that's why he decided to

804
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:18,380
marry the queen of the pig people.

805
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:20,860
I'll tell you one thing, Fred, darling...

806
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:23,780
I'd marry you for your money
in a minute.

807
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:26,940
- Would you marry me for my money?
- In a minute.

808
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:30,180
I guess it's pretty lucky
neither of us is rich, huh?

809
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:32,060
Yeah.

810
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:37,500
Oh, Fred, darling,
I'm so glad to see you.

811
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:44,300
What have you been doing?

812
01:04:44,300 --> 01:04:46,100
Writing, mostly.

813
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:51,300
Sold a story.
Just got word this morning.

814
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:55,980
Oh, that's marvelous!
It really is.

815
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:59,380
Only how does your decorator friend
feel about it?

816
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:01,940
Aren't you supposed to be
saving yourself?

817
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:03,380
You know something?

818
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:06,340
I haven't got around to
telling her yet.

819
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:08,460
Look, why don't we go have a drink

820
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:10,500
or take a walk to celebrate?

821
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:13,980
All right. There's some
champagne in the icebox.

822
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:18,100
- Why don't you open it while I get dressed?
- OK

823
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:21,820
I don't think I've ever drunk
champagne before breakfast before.

824
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:24,540
With breakfast on several occasions,

825
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:26,220
but never before before.

826
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:28,220
Well, I've got a wonderful idea.

827
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:30,980
We'll spend the day doing things
we've never done before.

828
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:34,540
We'll take turns. First something
you've never done, then me.

829
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:38,660
'course, I can't think of anything
I've never done.

830
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:56,020
I've never been for a walk
in the morning before.

831
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:58,060
Not in New York.

832
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:01,500
I've walked up 5th Avenue at 6:00,
but I consider that still night.

833
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:04,900
- Do you think it counts?
- Sure, it counts. Now we're even.

834
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:20,340
- Don't you just love it?
- Love what?

835
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:22,260
Tiffany's.

836
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:33,540
Isn't it wonderful?

837
01:06:33,540 --> 01:06:37,140
See what I mean, how nothing bad
could happen to you in a place like this?

838
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:41,340
It isn't that I give a hoot about
jewelry, except diamonds, of course.

839
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:43,060
Like that.

840
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:52,460
- What do you think?
- Well...

841
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:58,300
Personally, I think it would be tacky
to wear diamonds before I'm 40.

842
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:01,420
Well, you're right, but meantime
you should have something.

843
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:02,940
I'll wait.

844
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:05,260
No, I'm going to buy you a present.

845
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:08,420
You bought me a typewriter ribbon
and it brought luck.

846
01:07:08,420 --> 01:07:10,580
But Tiffany's can be pretty expensive.

847
01:07:10,580 --> 01:07:12,700
I've got my check and $10.

848
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:15,020
I wouldn't let you cash your check,

849
01:07:15,020 --> 01:07:18,820
but a present for $10 or under,
that I will accept.

850
01:07:18,820 --> 01:07:22,660
Of course, I don't know what
we'll find here for $10.

851
01:07:31,940 --> 01:07:33,460
May I help you?

852
01:07:33,460 --> 01:07:36,660
Perhaps. We're looking for
a present for the lady.

853
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:37,980
Certainly, sir.

854
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:40,020
Is there something special
you have in mind?

855
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:44,020
Well, we've considered diamonds.

856
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:47,860
And I don't to offend you but,
the lady feels that diamonds are tacky for her.

857
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:51,580
Oh, I think they're divine for
older women,

858
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:54,100
but they're not right for me,
you understand.

859
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:57,340
- Certainly.
- In fairness, I ought to explain

860
01:07:57,340 --> 01:08:00,580
there's also a secondary problem,
one of finance.

861
01:08:00,580 --> 01:08:04,220
We can only afford to spend...
a limited amount.

862
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:07,300
- May I ask how limited?
- $10.

863
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:12,500
That was the outside figure, yes.

864
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:15,860
- I see.
- Do you have anything for $10?

865
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:18,220
Frankly, madam,
within that price range

866
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:20,900
the variety of merchandise is
rather limited.

867
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:24,260
However, I do think we might have...
Let's see...

868
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:26,300
Strictly as a novelty,
you understand...

869
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:29,340
For the lady and gentleman
who has everything,

870
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:31,980
a sterlingsilver telephone dialer.

871
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:35,060
That's 6.75, including tax.

872
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:37,780
A sterlingsilver telephone dialer.

873
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:41,500
Yes, sir. That's 6,75 dollar,
including Federal Tax.

874
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:44,690
Well, the price is right,
but I must say

875
01:08:44,690 --> 01:08:48,380
I'd rather hoped for something slightly more...
How shall I say it...

876
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:50,140
Romantic in feeling.

877
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:53,500
- What do you think?
- A sterlingsilver telephone dialer?

878
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:57,260
I certainly think it's handsome,
but, well, you do understand.

879
01:08:58,380 --> 01:08:59,860
Well, we tried but...

880
01:08:59,860 --> 01:09:02,940
We could have something engraved,
couldn't we?

881
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:05,940
Yes, I suppose so. Yes, indeed.

882
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:09,460
The only problem is, you'd have
to buy something first

883
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:13,820
in order to have some object upon
which to place the engraving.

884
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:16,140
You see dificulty?

885
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:19,420
Well, we could have this engraved,
couldn't we?

886
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:21,300
I think it would be very smart.

887
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:26,060
This, I take it, was not
purchased at Tiffany's?

888
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:29,770
No. Actually, it was purchased concurrent with...

889
01:09:29,770 --> 01:09:33,020
Well, actually it came inside a...

890
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:36,650
- Well, a box of cracker jack.
- I see.

891
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:41,500
Do they still really have prizes
in cracker jack boxes?

892
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:44,540
- Oh, yes.
- That's nice to know.

893
01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:48,180
It gives one a feeling of solidarity,

894
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:51,420
almost of continuity with the past,
that sort of thing.

895
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:54,020
Would Tiffany's really engrave it for us?

896
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:56,650
They wouldn't feel it beneath
them or anything?

897
01:09:56,650 --> 01:09:58,770
Well, it's rather unusual, madam,

898
01:09:58,770 --> 01:10:02,540
but I think you'll find that Tiffany's
is very understanding.

899
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:05,020
If you would tell me the initials,

900
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:08,980
I think we could have something
ready for you in the morning.

901
01:10:10,220 --> 01:10:13,220
Didn't I tell you this was
a lovely place?

902
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:35,540
What is this place anyway?

903
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:38,460
You wanted to sit down.
It's the public library.

904
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:42,060
- You've never been here?
- No. That makes two for me.

905
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:43,580
I don't see any books.

906
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:45,460
They're in there.

907
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:50,650
See?

908
01:10:54,540 --> 01:10:58,020
Each one of these drawers
is stuffed with little cards.

909
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:01,220
Each little card is a book
or an author.

910
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:02,980
I think that's fascinating.

911
01:11:02,980 --> 01:11:06,980
- V-a-r-j-a-k.
- Really?

912
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:11,820
Look. Isn't it marvelous?

913
01:11:11,820 --> 01:11:14,650
There you are...
Right in the public library.

914
01:11:14,650 --> 01:11:18,140
Varjak, Paul. "Nine lives."

915
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:19,860
Then a lot of numbers.

916
01:11:19,860 --> 01:11:22,500
Do they really have the book itself?
Live?

917
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:24,580
Sure. Follow me.

918
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:35,980
Number 57. That's us.

919
01:11:36,060 --> 01:11:38,020
57, please.

920
01:11:38,020 --> 01:11:40,980
"Nine lives" by Varjak, Paul.

921
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:43,020
Have you read it?
It's marvelous.

922
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:45,940
- I'm afraid, I haven't.
- You should. He wrote it.

923
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:48,460
He's Varjak, Paul, in person.

924
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:50,180
She doesn't believe me.

925
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:52,060
Show her your driver's license

926
01:11:52,060 --> 01:11:54,540
or Dinner's Club card
or something.

927
01:11:54,540 --> 01:11:57,690
He's really the author.
Cross my heart and kiss my elbow.

928
01:11:57,690 --> 01:11:59,650
Would you kindly lower your voice?

929
01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:01,500
Autograph it.

930
01:12:01,500 --> 01:12:03,900
Wouldn't that be nice?
Sort of making more personal?

931
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:05,540
really, Miss...

932
01:12:05,540 --> 01:12:08,540
Go ahead. Don't be stuck,
signera den.

933
01:12:08,540 --> 01:12:10,460
Vad ska jag skriva?

934
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:12,540
Någonting sentimentalt,
autograph it.

935
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:14,900
What shall I say? Stop that!

936
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:17,180
You're defacing public property.

937
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:19,020
Well, if that's how you feel,

938
01:12:19,020 --> 01:12:20,860
come on, let's get out of here.

939
01:12:20,860 --> 01:12:24,620
I don't think this place is
half as nice as Tiffany's.

940
01:12:36,980 --> 01:12:40,220
Did you ever steal anything
from a 5-and-10

941
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:41,770
when you were a kid?

942
01:12:41,770 --> 01:12:44,820
No. I'm the sensitive, bookish type.
Did you?

943
01:12:44,820 --> 01:12:48,860
Yes, I still do now and then
sort of to keep my hand in.

944
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:53,260
Come on. Don't be chicken, you've
never done it, and it's your turn.

945
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:37,420
I can't see.

946
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:10,180
Hi, cat. Lady of the house at home?

947
01:17:40,060 --> 01:17:41,860
Bu!

948
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:45,650
You're crazy. You know that, don't you?

949
01:17:45,650 --> 01:17:47,820
But I love you anyway.

950
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:50,500
- Tooley?
- Yeah?

951
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,860
I've... got to talk to you.

952
01:17:54,020 --> 01:17:55,380
All right.

953
01:17:59,220 --> 01:18:01,060
You want a drink?

954
01:18:06,940 --> 01:18:08,860
If this is going to be
a serious discussion...

955
01:18:08,860 --> 01:18:12,420
and suddenly I'm terribly
afraid it is...

956
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:15,220
you're going to have to take off
that ridiculous mask,

957
01:18:15,220 --> 01:18:17,650
or else I'll have to wear one too.

958
01:18:17,770 --> 01:18:21,020
Tooley, look, please.

959
01:18:25,690 --> 01:18:28,580
What's the matter? Girl trouble?

960
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:31,140
Is that it, darling?

961
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:35,690
Oh, I see.

962
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:39,770
Well, that's not too serious.

963
01:18:39,770 --> 01:18:42,650
As a matter of fact,
I've expecting it.

964
01:18:42,650 --> 01:18:46,730
I can't say I like it,
but I've been expecting it.

965
01:18:46,730 --> 01:18:48,020
Who is she?

966
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:50,730
Hasn't got anything to do with her.

967
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:53,540
This is between you and me.

968
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:55,900
Oh, then it's serious.

969
01:18:57,260 --> 01:18:58,540
Well, now...

970
01:18:58,540 --> 01:19:01,140
Tooley, you're a very stylish girl.

971
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:03,380
Can't we end this stylishly?

972
01:19:05,140 --> 01:19:07,900
- End it?
- Yes.

973
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:18,860
Well... I do believe love
has found Andy Hardy.

974
01:19:18,860 --> 01:19:21,900
Let's see... a waitress?

975
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:23,860
A salesgirl?

976
01:19:23,860 --> 01:19:27,940
No. She'd have to be someone rich,
wouldn't she, Paul?

977
01:19:27,940 --> 01:19:29,980
Someone who could help you.

978
01:19:29,980 --> 01:19:32,140
Curiously enough...

979
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:38,940
She's a girl who can't help anyone,
not even herself.

980
01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:43,860
The thing is, I can help her,
and it's a nice feeling for a change.

981
01:19:45,820 --> 01:19:48,340
All right.

982
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:50,540
I understand.

983
01:19:52,540 --> 01:19:54,650
I'll tell you what, Paul.

984
01:19:54,650 --> 01:19:57,340
I'm very stylish girl.

985
01:19:57,340 --> 01:19:59,900
- What are you doing?
- Writing a check.

986
01:20:02,820 --> 01:20:04,340
Don't look so bewildered.

987
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:07,020
Surely you've noticed me
writing checks before.

988
01:20:07,020 --> 01:20:11,420
Pay to the order of Paul Varjak...
$1,000.

989
01:20:11,420 --> 01:20:15,340
Take her away somewhere
for a week.

990
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:17,730
You're entitled
to a vacation with pay.

991
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:20,730
Simply a matter of fair
labor practice, darling.

992
01:20:20,730 --> 01:20:22,260
If you were really smart,

993
01:20:22,260 --> 01:20:25,140
you'd get the boys together
and organize a union.

994
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:27,580
That way you'd get all
the fringe benefits...

995
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:30,650
Hospitalization, a pension plan,

996
01:20:30,650 --> 01:20:33,650
and unemployment insurance
when you are...

997
01:20:33,650 --> 01:20:35,650
How shall I put it...

998
01:20:35,650 --> 01:20:37,620
between engagements?

999
01:20:40,690 --> 01:20:43,770
Thanks for making it easier for me.

1000
01:20:43,770 --> 01:20:46,650
Don't be ridiculous, darling.

1001
01:20:46,650 --> 01:20:50,220
Take the check. And call your girl.

1002
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:53,730
No, thanks. I've got a check of my own.

1003
01:20:56,020 --> 01:20:59,500
When you get yourself a new
writer to help,

1004
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:01,420
try and find one my size.

1005
01:21:01,420 --> 01:21:05,140
That way you won't have to even
shorten the sleeves.

1006
01:22:04,340 --> 01:22:08,460
- Oh, what are you doing?
- Excuse me.

1007
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:09,540
Uh, I... I'm sorry.

1008
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:12,650
You look just like a girl
I know, named Holly.

1009
01:22:12,650 --> 01:22:14,650
Really?

1010
01:22:14,650 --> 01:22:16,540
I'm sorry.

1011
01:22:44,540 --> 01:22:45,900
Hi.

1012
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:55,060
What do you want?

1013
01:22:56,140 --> 01:22:58,180
I want to talk to you.

1014
01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:01,140
I'm busy.

1015
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:05,860
- What are you doing?
- Reading.

1016
01:23:05,860 --> 01:23:09,940
"South America:
Land of wealth and promise"?

1017
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:13,020
It's very interesting.

1018
01:23:13,020 --> 01:23:15,300
Let's get out of here.

1019
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:22,540
I said, let's get out of here.
I want to talk to you.

1020
01:23:22,540 --> 01:23:25,580
What's the matter with you anyway?
What's happened?

1021
01:23:26,650 --> 01:23:29,980
Fred, will you please just
leave me alone?

1022
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:33,260
I love you.

1023
01:23:39,820 --> 01:23:44,340
- Where are you going?
- To the ladies room.

1024
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:47,260
- What's the matter with you?
- Let me go.

1025
01:23:47,260 --> 01:23:49,300
- No.
- Fred, let me go.

1026
01:23:49,300 --> 01:23:50,580
Let's get something straight.

1027
01:23:50,580 --> 01:23:54,580
I'm not nor have I ever been Fred,
nor am I Benny Shacklett.

1028
01:23:54,580 --> 01:23:57,860
My name is Paul, Paul Varjak,
and I love you.

1029
01:23:57,860 --> 01:24:02,650
- Let me go.
- Not till we settle this. What's
about all this jazz about South AmericaVar?

1030
01:24:02,650 --> 01:24:04,940
I thought if I'm marrying
a south-american,

1031
01:24:04,940 --> 01:24:07,500
I'd better find out something
about the country.

1032
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:10,140
- Marry? What south-american?
- José.

1033
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:13,020
- Who the hell's José?
- José de Silva Pereira.

1034
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:15,020
Who the hell's José de Silva Pereira?

1035
01:24:15,020 --> 01:24:18,380
Darling, you met him, I know you did...
Mag Wildwood's friend.

1036
01:24:18,380 --> 01:24:20,980
He came to the party with Rusty.

1037
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:22,900
Well, my dear, you won't believe this,

1038
01:24:23,020 --> 01:24:25,460
but not only is he handsome and rich,

1039
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:27,500
he's absolutely cuckoo for me.

1040
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:30,380
- You're crazy.
- Do you think you own me?

1041
01:24:30,380 --> 01:24:31,730
That's exactly what I think.

1042
01:24:31,730 --> 01:24:35,020
That's exactly what everybody thinks,
but everybody happens to be wrong.

1043
01:24:35,020 --> 01:24:36,940
Look, I'm not everybody.

1044
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:42,140
Or am I?

1045
01:24:42,140 --> 01:24:44,420
Is that what you really think?

1046
01:24:44,420 --> 01:24:49,260
That I'm not different from
all you other rats and super-rats?

1047
01:24:49,260 --> 01:24:51,060
wait a minute.

1048
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:54,140
If that's it...

1049
01:24:54,140 --> 01:24:56,940
If that's what you really think...

1050
01:24:56,940 --> 01:24:59,860
There's something I want to give you.

1051
01:25:02,980 --> 01:25:05,020
What's that?

1052
01:25:05,020 --> 01:25:07,100
$50 for the powder room.

1053
01:25:38,260 --> 01:25:41,900
the place is in such a mess,
I couldn't face it alone.

1054
01:25:41,900 --> 01:25:44,540
- Ah, you have a message.
- No.

1055
01:25:48,020 --> 01:25:49,380
Olé.

1056
01:26:05,860 --> 01:26:07,620
Good evening, Mr. Yunioshi.

1057
01:26:10,860 --> 01:26:13,420
- Oh, good evening, Paul.
- Good evening.

1058
01:26:15,500 --> 01:26:16,730
Good evening.

1059
01:26:31,650 --> 01:26:33,340
Please, you must help me.

1060
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:53,180
Let me go. No!

1061
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:20,380
No! No!

1062
01:27:39,340 --> 01:27:42,180
- What did you do to her?
- Nothing.

1063
01:27:42,180 --> 01:27:44,220
There was a telegram, and then this...

1064
01:27:44,220 --> 01:27:47,540
Crashing everything and acting like
a crazy... It's appalling.

1065
01:27:47,540 --> 01:27:50,300
I can't have a public scandal.
It's too delicate...

1066
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:52,380
My name, my position, my family.

1067
01:27:52,380 --> 01:27:54,300
Will there be the police again?

1068
01:27:54,300 --> 01:27:57,700
I don't see why. There's no law
against busting up your apartment.

1069
01:27:57,700 --> 01:28:01,260
- Where is the telegram?
- There it is.

1070
01:28:07,140 --> 01:28:09,780
"Received notice young Fred killed..."

1071
01:28:13,060 --> 01:28:16,940
"in jeep-accident, Fort Riley, Kansas."

1072
01:28:16,940 --> 01:28:19,300
"Your husband and children
join in the sorrow"

1073
01:28:19,300 --> 01:28:20,740
"of our mutual lost.".

1074
01:28:21,940 --> 01:28:25,420
"Letter following. Love, Doc."

1075
01:28:25,420 --> 01:28:26,940
Her brother Fred.

1076
01:28:29,580 --> 01:28:32,460
This brother, was she very
close to him?

1077
01:28:32,460 --> 01:28:33,780
Yeah.

1078
01:28:36,820 --> 01:28:38,940
What can one do?

1079
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:40,820
Try to help her.

1080
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:44,300
I tried,
It didn't do much good.

1081
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:47,180
You got a ranch or
something in Brazil?

1082
01:28:47,180 --> 01:28:49,100
Yes.

1083
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:51,340
that's good. She'll like that.

1084
01:28:53,740 --> 01:28:56,140
Well, you better get in here.

1085
01:30:20,660 --> 01:30:23,580
- Hi.
- Hello. Got your wire.

1086
01:30:23,580 --> 01:30:26,060
How did you know where to reach me?

1087
01:30:26,060 --> 01:30:28,540
Oh, I tried everything...
Called people, asked around,

1088
01:30:28,540 --> 01:30:32,900
and suddenly I thought of the phone
book. Anyway, I'm glad you came.

1089
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:35,460
You look fine.

1090
01:30:35,460 --> 01:30:38,820
I'm fat as a pig, and I haven't
had my hair done,

1091
01:30:38,820 --> 01:30:41,780
but I'm happy, really happy...
It probably shows.

1092
01:30:41,780 --> 01:30:43,500
You look 'trés distingué' yourself.

1093
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:46,180
I've got a job.
I've been writing a little.

1094
01:30:46,180 --> 01:30:48,420
I've read three of your stories...

1095
01:30:48,420 --> 01:30:52,980
Two in The New Yorker
and one in that funny little magazine.

1096
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:56,180
- Won't you sit down?.
- Thank you.

1097
01:30:56,180 --> 01:30:58,980
- I've taken up knitting.
- So I see.

1098
01:31:00,220 --> 01:31:03,900
It'll probably look, uh... very nice
once it's finished.

1099
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:05,700
I'm a little nervous about it.

1100
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:08,700
José brought up the blueprints
for a new ranch house he's building.

1101
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:13,180
I have this strange feeling that
the blueprints and my knitting instructions
got switched.

1102
01:31:13,180 --> 01:31:15,980
I may be knitting a ranch house.

1103
01:31:24,660 --> 01:31:28,100
really, darling, I can't tell
you how divinely happy I am.

1104
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:30,220
What is that, anyhow?

1105
01:31:30,220 --> 01:31:33,140
Portuguese...
A very complicated language.

1106
01:31:33,140 --> 01:31:35,860
4,000 irregular verbs.

1107
01:31:41,780 --> 01:31:43,380
Hmm. Very impresive. What's it mean?

1108
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:46,100
I believe you're in league
with the butcher.

1109
01:31:49,780 --> 01:31:52,140
Holly, what's this about?

1110
01:31:52,900 --> 01:31:55,540
Why did you want to see me?

1111
01:31:55,540 --> 01:31:59,620
José's in Washington for the night,
so I thought I'd ask you over,

1112
01:31:59,620 --> 01:32:03,140
adn, well, I've said goodbye to
everyone else I care about.

1113
01:32:03,140 --> 01:32:05,780
- You're going somewhere?
- I'm going to Rio, tomorrow.

1114
01:32:05,780 --> 01:32:09,220
I've got the plane ticket and I've
even said goodbye to Sally.

1115
01:32:09,220 --> 01:32:12,060
- José's flying down with you?
- We're going on separate planes.

1116
01:32:12,060 --> 01:32:14,780
He doesn't think it looks right
for us to travel together.

1117
01:32:14,780 --> 01:32:18,980
His family's important down there,
so he worries about things like that.

1118
01:32:18,980 --> 01:32:22,980
Anyway, I thought I'd show off
and cook dinner for us.

1119
01:32:22,980 --> 01:32:25,900
Did I tell you how divinely
and utterly happy I am?

1120
01:32:25,900 --> 01:32:27,060
Yes.

1121
01:32:27,060 --> 01:32:29,140
You're getting married, then?

1122
01:32:29,140 --> 01:32:32,420
Well, he hasn't really asked me,
not in so many words.

1123
01:32:32,420 --> 01:32:35,300
Four, you mean?

1124
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:38,180
Well, that's how many words it takes...

1125
01:32:38,180 --> 01:32:41,020
Will you marry me?

1126
01:32:41,020 --> 01:32:43,300
Oh, we'll get married, all right.

1127
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:45,460
And in church and with his family there.

1128
01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:49,220
And that's why he's waiting till
we get to Rio... Probably.

1129
01:32:52,100 --> 01:32:54,700
Do you think it's trying to
tell us something?

1130
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:58,540
I hope you like chicken and saffron
rice served with chocolate sauce.

1131
01:32:58,540 --> 01:33:00,540
It's an east indian classic, my dear.

1132
01:33:00,540 --> 01:33:02,460
Three months ago I couldn't
scramble eggs.

1133
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:09,020
Oh, are you all right?

1134
01:33:09,020 --> 01:33:11,940
Oh, golly, darling,
I did so want to impress you.

1135
01:33:11,940 --> 01:33:15,580
Look, I'm not much for chicken
with sauce anyway.

1136
01:33:15,580 --> 01:33:19,780
Why don't we go out somewhere?

1137
01:33:19,780 --> 01:33:23,340
Let me buy you a farewell dinner.
Oh, that would be fun, as long as
I can go like this.

1138
01:33:30,340 --> 01:33:35,340
Years from now, years and years,
I'll be back...

1139
01:33:35,340 --> 01:33:37,660
Me and nine
brazilian brats.

1140
01:33:38,980 --> 01:33:41,300
They'll be dark like José, of course,

1141
01:33:41,300 --> 01:33:44,060
but they'll have bright green,
beautiful eyes.

1142
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:48,380
I'll bring them back, all right,

1143
01:33:48,380 --> 01:33:49,980
because they must see this.

1144
01:33:51,180 --> 01:33:52,700
Oh, I love New York.

1145
01:33:52,700 --> 01:33:57,700
Then, why are you leaving?
What's in it for you?

1146
01:33:57,700 --> 01:34:00,740
Look, I know what you're thinking,
and I don't blame you.

1147
01:34:00,740 --> 01:34:03,420
I've always thrown out
such a jazzy line,

1148
01:34:03,420 --> 01:34:08,620
but really, except for Doc and yourself
José's my first non-rat romance.

1149
01:34:08,620 --> 01:34:11,500
Not that he's my idea of the
absolute finito.

1150
01:34:11,500 --> 01:34:15,740
He's too prim and cautious
to be my absolute ideal.

1151
01:34:15,740 --> 01:34:19,540
Now, if I could choose from anybody
alive, I wouldn't pick José.

1152
01:34:19,540 --> 01:34:22,260
Nero, maybe, or Albert Schweitzer.

1153
01:34:22,260 --> 01:34:24,180
or Leonard Bernstein.

1154
01:34:25,540 --> 01:34:27,660
But I am mad about José.

1155
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:30,580
I honestly think I'd give up
smoking if he asked me.

1156
01:34:32,980 --> 01:34:36,180
Come on, darling, let's eat,
It's getting late.

1157
01:34:37,580 --> 01:34:40,980
I'm leaving tomorrow and
I haven't even begun to pack.

1158
01:35:00,620 --> 01:35:04,260
Didn't want José to think
I'm a girl who loses her key,

1159
01:35:04,260 --> 01:35:06,540
so I had 26 of them made.

1160
01:35:06,540 --> 01:35:09,900
Wait. I got a better idea.
Kind of a farewell gesture.

1161
01:35:11,820 --> 01:35:13,420
Somebody must have tripped the lock.

1162
01:35:13,420 --> 01:35:15,940
Ah, crafty devil, that Yunioshi.

1163
01:35:15,940 --> 01:35:18,420
Wake up, wake up! The british are coming!

1164
01:35:18,420 --> 01:35:20,140
Or, in this case,
the brazilians.

1165
01:35:20,140 --> 01:35:21,460
Exactly.

1166
01:35:21,460 --> 01:35:24,580
Ooh, I've still got to clean up
all that rice.

1167
01:35:24,580 --> 01:35:25,860
Hey, you know...

1168
01:35:28,540 --> 01:35:34,100
There she are who did it!
The wanted woman! There!

1169
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:35,980
Groenburger. Narcotics squad.

1170
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:38,260
- What do you mean?
- What's going on?

1171
01:35:38,260 --> 01:35:40,980
- Why don't you ask your boss?
- What boss?

1172
01:35:40,980 --> 01:35:43,100
Sally Tomato. Ask him. Come on.

1173
01:35:43,100 --> 01:35:46,420
Look around for narcotic!
They got plenty narcotic in there.

1174
01:36:04,460 --> 01:36:06,940
- What's your name?
- Varjak.

1175
01:36:06,940 --> 01:36:08,780
Hold it down over there!

1176
01:36:08,780 --> 01:36:13,060
Paul Varjak. V-A-R-J-A-K.
Hey! Get lost!

1177
01:36:13,060 --> 01:36:14,620
Get out!

1178
01:36:14,620 --> 01:36:18,220
I'm a writer.
W-R-I-T-E-R.

1179
01:36:21,300 --> 01:36:23,620
I can't answer all your questions.

1180
01:36:23,620 --> 01:36:27,060
One at a time. One, please. Good.

1181
01:36:28,980 --> 01:36:30,940
I can't answer all your questions.

1182
01:36:30,940 --> 01:36:32,260
One at a time, please.

1183
01:36:32,260 --> 01:36:34,180
Knock it off!

1184
01:36:35,780 --> 01:36:37,660
- Now darling why don't you star?
- Did you carry messages

1185
01:36:37,660 --> 01:36:39,940
from Tomato in code?

1186
01:36:39,940 --> 01:36:41,460
Of course not.

1187
01:36:41,460 --> 01:36:43,780
I'd just give Mr. O'Shaughnessy
the weather report.

1188
01:36:43,780 --> 01:36:46,620
Simply do not ask me what this is all about.
'Parce que je ne sais pas, mes chers.'

1189
01:36:46,620 --> 01:36:50,580
- You did used to visit Tomato?
- Every week. What's wrong with that?

1190
01:36:50,580 --> 01:36:52,780
Tomato's part of the narcotics syndicate.

1191
01:36:52,780 --> 01:36:54,820
He never mentioned narcotics.

1192
01:36:54,820 --> 01:36:58,220
These wretched people keep
persecuting him.

1193
01:36:58,220 --> 01:37:01,020
He's a deeply sensitive person,
a darling old man.

1194
01:37:01,020 --> 01:37:03,220
- Then, you're innocent.
- Of course, I'm innocent.

1195
01:37:03,220 --> 01:37:08,740
- What are you going to do about it?
- What do you mean?
- Well, who's your lawyer?

1196
01:37:08,740 --> 01:37:11,100
- I don't know.
Mr. O'Shaughnessy, I guess.
- Mr. O'Shaughnessy!

1197
01:37:14,380 --> 01:37:16,180
Hey! Get out of here!

1198
01:37:16,180 --> 01:37:18,660
All right, come on! OK, move.

1199
01:37:21,100 --> 01:37:23,660
- Aw, shut up!
- Get in there!

1200
01:37:44,140 --> 01:37:46,700
- Hello.
- Mr. Paul Varjak?

1201
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:47,780
Yeah.

1202
01:37:47,780 --> 01:37:49,940
Ready with Mr. Berman in Hollywood.

1203
01:37:49,940 --> 01:37:53,180
Kindly deposit $3.00 for the first
3 minutes.

1204
01:38:01,660 --> 01:38:04,660
Hello? Hello?

1205
01:38:04,660 --> 01:38:07,900
O.J. Berman here.
Who's calling?

1206
01:38:07,900 --> 01:38:12,180
- Mr. Berman, this is Paul Varjak.
- Nice to talk to you, kid.

1207
01:38:12,180 --> 01:38:15,500
Varjak. V-A-R-J-A-K.

1208
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:18,380
I'm a friend of Holly's.
We met at a party, in New York.

1209
01:38:18,380 --> 01:38:22,580
- Who?
- Paul. Paul Varjak.

1210
01:38:22,580 --> 01:38:24,460
V-A-R...

1211
01:38:24,460 --> 01:38:27,420
Mr. Berman, this is Fred.

1212
01:38:27,420 --> 01:38:29,460
Oh, Fred, baby, huh?

1213
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:31,900
You're calling about the kid, huh?

1214
01:38:31,900 --> 01:38:36,660
Everything's under control.
You just relax.

1215
01:38:36,660 --> 01:38:38,980
I spoke to my lawyer in New York.

1216
01:38:38,980 --> 01:38:42,940
I told him to take care of everything,
send me the bill, keep my name anonymous.

1217
01:38:42,940 --> 01:38:47,060
- What?
- I don't want any part of it.

1218
01:38:47,060 --> 01:38:49,380
You sound like you're in a tunnel.

1219
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:51,820
It's this executive phone I have.

1220
01:38:51,820 --> 01:38:54,700
- What?
- Executive phone!

1221
01:38:54,700 --> 01:38:57,100
Thay only got her on 10,000 bail.

1222
01:38:57,100 --> 01:38:59,580
My lawyer can get her out at 10 A.M.

1223
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:01,500
I tell you what to do.

1224
01:39:01,500 --> 01:39:04,340
You bust into that dump she lives in,

1225
01:39:04,340 --> 01:39:05,700
collect all her junk,

1226
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:11,220
go down to the jail, get her out,
take her to a hotel under a phony name.

1227
01:39:11,220 --> 01:39:13,740
Try to keep her away from the reporters.

1228
01:39:13,740 --> 01:39:16,500
- Will you do that?
- Sure, Mr. Berman.

1229
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:18,780
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate...

1230
01:39:18,780 --> 01:39:22,460
Forget it.
I mean, I owe her something.

1231
01:39:23,580 --> 01:39:27,740
not that I owe her anything,
if you really want to get right
down to it.

1232
01:39:27,740 --> 01:39:30,420
but... she's crazy.

1233
01:39:32,180 --> 01:39:33,980
She's a phony.

1234
01:39:35,420 --> 01:39:37,740
But she's a real phony.

1235
01:39:37,740 --> 01:39:39,700
Know what I mean, kid?

1236
01:39:39,700 --> 01:39:42,060
Yeah, I know what you mean.

1237
01:39:42,060 --> 01:39:44,300
Thanks, Mr. Berman. Thanks a lot.

1238
01:39:44,300 --> 01:39:46,020
Right!

1239
01:39:52,260 --> 01:39:54,500
Why don't you behave?

1240
01:40:05,300 --> 01:40:07,580
'Quel' night.

1241
01:40:20,740 --> 01:40:23,540
I did a little housebreaking
while you were away.

1242
01:40:23,540 --> 01:40:25,940
Clayton Hotel. 84th and Madison.

1243
01:40:28,220 --> 01:40:31,580
O.J. thinks it would be a good idea
if you stayed out of sight for a while.

1244
01:40:31,580 --> 01:40:34,060
I got your stuff here, including cat.

1245
01:40:34,060 --> 01:40:36,380
Hope he's all right.

1246
01:40:36,380 --> 01:40:38,220
Hi, cat...

1247
01:40:38,220 --> 01:40:40,180
Poor no-name slob.

1248
01:40:42,020 --> 01:40:45,020
Listen, darling,
did you find that plane ticket?

1249
01:40:45,020 --> 01:40:48,620
- Right here. We can cash it in.
- Cash it in? Are you kidding?

1250
01:40:48,620 --> 01:40:52,300
- What time is it?
- A little after 10:00.

1251
01:40:52,300 --> 01:40:53,660
Good. Idylwild airport, driver.

1252
01:40:53,660 --> 01:40:57,140
- Never mind. You can't do that.
- Why not?.

1253
01:40:57,140 --> 01:40:59,380
You don't understand.
You're under indictment.

1254
01:40:59,380 --> 01:41:02,700
You jump bail, they'll
throw away the key.

1255
01:41:02,700 --> 01:41:05,620
Don't be ridiculous, darling.
I'll be married

1256
01:41:05,620 --> 01:41:07,620
to the future president of Brazil.

1257
01:41:07,620 --> 01:41:11,140
That'll give me diplomatic inmunity,
or something.

1258
01:41:11,140 --> 01:41:13,820
I wouldn't be on it.

1259
01:41:13,820 --> 01:41:16,740
What is it, darling?

1260
01:41:16,740 --> 01:41:19,980
I have a message for you.

1261
01:41:21,460 --> 01:41:23,020
Oh, yes, I see.

1262
01:41:23,020 --> 01:41:28,140
Did he bring it in person, or was it...
just there, shoved the door?

1263
01:41:28,140 --> 01:41:29,660
A cousin.

1264
01:41:31,620 --> 01:41:33,940
Hand me my purse, will you, darling?

1265
01:41:33,940 --> 01:41:36,420
A girl can't read that sort of thing...

1266
01:41:36,420 --> 01:41:37,700
Without her lipstick.

1267
01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:41,620
You read it to me, will you, darling?

1268
01:41:41,620 --> 01:41:44,100
I don't think I can quite...
bear...

1269
01:41:44,100 --> 01:41:46,260
Are you sure you want me?

1270
01:41:51,780 --> 01:41:53,940
"My dearest littel girl,"

1271
01:41:53,940 --> 01:41:57,860
"I had loved you,
knowing you were not as others,"

1272
01:41:57,860 --> 01:41:59,900
"but conceive of my despair"

1273
01:41:59,900 --> 01:42:03,500
"upon discovering in such a
brutal and public style"

1274
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:07,100
"how very different you are
from the manner of woman"

1275
01:42:07,100 --> 01:42:10,380
"a man of my position could
hope to make his wife."

1276
01:42:10,380 --> 01:42:13,860
"I grieve for the disgrace
of your present circumstances,"

1277
01:42:13,860 --> 01:42:16,900
"and I do not find it in my heart"

1278
01:42:16,900 --> 01:42:18,660
"to add my condemn..."

1279
01:42:18,660 --> 01:42:21,500
"to the condemn that surrounds you,"

1280
01:42:21,500 --> 01:42:26,300
"so I hope you will find it in your
heart not to condemn me."

1281
01:42:26,300 --> 01:42:29,180
"I have my family to protect
and my name and..."

1282
01:42:29,180 --> 01:42:33,260
"I'm a coward where these
institutions enter."

1283
01:42:33,260 --> 01:42:35,540
"Forget me, beautiful child,"

1284
01:42:35,540 --> 01:42:37,820
"and may God be with you."

1285
01:42:37,820 --> 01:42:39,180
"José."

1286
01:42:41,620 --> 01:42:42,940
Well...

1287
01:42:44,900 --> 01:42:48,740
Well, at least he's honest.
It's kind of touching.

1288
01:42:48,740 --> 01:42:51,540
Touching! That square-ball jazz.

1289
01:42:53,140 --> 01:42:55,060
He says he's a coward.

1290
01:42:55,060 --> 01:42:57,380
All right!
So he's not a regular rat,

1291
01:42:57,380 --> 01:42:58,900
or even a super-rat.

1292
01:42:58,900 --> 01:43:01,780
He's just scared little mouse,
that's all.

1293
01:43:01,780 --> 01:43:05,860
But, oh, Golly... gee! Damn!

1294
01:43:10,780 --> 01:43:15,900
Well, so much for South America.
I really didn't think

1295
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:19,220
you were cut out to be queen
of the Pampas anyway.

1296
01:43:19,220 --> 01:43:22,180
- Clayton Hotel.
- Idylwild.

1297
01:43:22,180 --> 01:43:23,540
What?

1298
01:43:23,540 --> 01:43:27,100
The plane leaves at 12:00,
and on it I plan to be.

1299
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:29,980
- Holly, you can't.
- 'Et pourquoi pas?'

1300
01:43:29,980 --> 01:43:32,460
I'm not hotfooting it after José,

1301
01:43:32,460 --> 01:43:34,740
If that's what you think. Oh, no.

1302
01:43:34,740 --> 01:43:37,620
As far as I'm concerned, he's the
future president of nowhere.

1303
01:43:37,620 --> 01:43:40,380
Only why should I waste a
good plane ticket?

1304
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:43,140
Besides, I've never been to Brazil.

1305
01:43:43,700 --> 01:43:47,060
Please, darling, don't sit there
looking at me like that.

1306
01:43:47,060 --> 01:43:49,900
I'm going, and that's
all there is to it.

1307
01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:55,260
All they want from me are my
services as a State's witness
against Sally.

1308
01:43:55,260 --> 01:43:58,380
Nobody has any intention of
prosecuting me.

1309
01:43:58,380 --> 01:44:02,580
To begin with, they don't
have a ghost of a chance.

1310
01:44:02,580 --> 01:44:06,420
This town's finished for me...
At least for a while.

1311
01:44:06,420 --> 01:44:08,300
There are certain shades of limelight

1312
01:44:08,300 --> 01:44:10,860
that can wreck a girl's complexion.

1313
01:44:10,860 --> 01:44:14,060
They'll have the rope up
at every saloon in the town.

1314
01:44:14,780 --> 01:44:17,940
I'll tell you what you do for me
darling.

1315
01:44:17,940 --> 01:44:21,020
When you get back to town
call up the New York Times
or whoever you call.

1316
01:44:21,020 --> 01:44:26,580
Mail me a list of the 50 richest
men in Brazil... The 50 richest!

1317
01:44:28,700 --> 01:44:30,620
Holy, I'm not going to let you do this.

1318
01:44:30,620 --> 01:44:33,500
- You're not going to let me?
- Holly, I'm in love with you.

1319
01:44:33,500 --> 01:44:37,700
- So what?
- So what? So plenty!

1320
01:44:37,700 --> 01:44:40,420
I love you. You belong to me.

1321
01:44:40,420 --> 01:44:42,860
No.
People don't belong to people.

1322
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:44,180
Of course they do.

1323
01:44:44,180 --> 01:44:47,860
- Nobody's going to put me in a cage.
- I don't wanna put you on a cage.
I want to love you!

1324
01:44:47,860 --> 01:44:51,300
- It's the same thing.
- No, it's not! Holly!

1325
01:44:51,300 --> 01:44:53,620
I'm not Holly.
I'm not Lula Mae, either.

1326
01:44:53,620 --> 01:44:57,260
I don't know who I am!.
I'm like cat here, a no-name slob.

1327
01:44:57,260 --> 01:44:59,100
We belong to nobody, and
nobody belongs to us.

1328
01:44:59,100 --> 01:45:03,260
We don't even belong to each other.
Stop the cab.

1329
01:45:08,740 --> 01:45:10,260
What do you think?

1330
01:45:10,260 --> 01:45:12,220
This ought to be the right kind of place

1331
01:45:12,220 --> 01:45:16,300
for a tough guy like you...
Garbage cans, rats galore.

1332
01:45:16,300 --> 01:45:19,820
Scram! I said take off! Beat it!

1333
01:45:19,820 --> 01:45:21,220
Let's go.

1334
01:45:32,740 --> 01:45:34,460
Driver...

1335
01:45:36,580 --> 01:45:38,380
Pull over here.

1336
01:45:46,820 --> 01:45:50,420
You know what's wrong with you,
Miss whoever-you-are?

1337
01:45:50,420 --> 01:45:52,460
You're chicken.
You got no guts.

1338
01:45:52,460 --> 01:45:55,500
You're afraid to say:
"OK, life's a fact."

1339
01:45:55,500 --> 01:45:57,100
People do fall in love.

1340
01:45:57,100 --> 01:45:58,780
People do belong to each other,

1341
01:45:58,780 --> 01:46:02,580
because that's the only chance
anybody's got for real happiness.

1342
01:46:02,580 --> 01:46:05,940
You call yourself a free spirit,
a wild thing.

1343
01:46:05,940 --> 01:46:08,900
And you're terrified somebody's
going to stick you in a cage.

1344
01:46:08,900 --> 01:46:11,100
Well, baby, you're already
in that cage.

1345
01:46:11,100 --> 01:46:12,420
You built it yourself.

1346
01:46:12,420 --> 01:46:15,820
And it's not bounded on the west by Tulip,
Texas or on the east by Somaliland.

1347
01:46:15,820 --> 01:46:19,100
It's wherever you go.
Because no matter where you run,

1348
01:46:19,100 --> 01:46:21,740
you just stand up running into yourself.

1349
01:46:27,380 --> 01:46:32,300
Here, I've been carrying this
thing around for months.

1350
01:46:32,300 --> 01:46:34,140
I don't want it anymore.

1351
01:47:24,260 --> 01:47:26,420
Here, cat!

1352
01:47:26,860 --> 01:47:28,220
Cat!

1353
01:47:36,420 --> 01:47:38,140
Where's the cat?

1354
01:47:39,340 --> 01:47:41,220
I don't know.

1355
01:48:49,900 --> 01:48:51,900
Here. Oh, cat!
