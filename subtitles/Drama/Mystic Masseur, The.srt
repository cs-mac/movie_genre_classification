1
00:00:01,449 --> 00:00:04,941
Eve, just tell them what they want to know.

2
00:00:05,153 --> 00:00:08,020
-Who was she dating?
-We already told the Savages.

3
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:10,953
-The Savage brothers?
-They were here yesterday.

4
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:14,492
Good, now try us out.
Who was she dating?

5
00:00:14,662 --> 00:00:16,960
No one special.

6
00:00:20,335 --> 00:00:23,566
You guys were having
a goodbye dinner, right?

7
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:26,705
-What?
-She was leaving town, wasn't she?

8
00:00:26,874 --> 00:00:30,241
-Going to Las Vegas?
-How do you know?

9
00:00:30,445 --> 00:00:35,314
She closed her bank account,
she had hotel phone numbers.

10
00:00:36,317 --> 00:00:39,445
She wanted out of this dump.
She wanted to start a new life.

11
00:00:39,821 --> 00:00:43,154
Well, a 19-year-old girl
doesn't go to Las Vegas alone.

12
00:00:43,858 --> 00:00:46,190
So who was she going with?

13
00:00:46,361 --> 00:00:50,422
Come on, girls.
Who was she going with?

14
00:00:51,332 --> 00:00:52,594
Brendan.

15
00:00:52,934 --> 00:00:54,993
Excuse me?

16
00:00:55,169 --> 00:00:58,536
-Brendan.
-Brendan Harris?

17
00:00:58,973 --> 00:01:01,168
Brendan Harris, yeah.

18
00:01:01,376 --> 00:01:03,173
You got an address?

19
00:01:16,658 --> 00:01:18,592
Hey, Dave.

20
00:01:22,463 --> 00:01:24,397
Hey, Jimmy.

21
00:01:24,565 --> 00:01:28,023
Sorry, I came out for a smoke.

22
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,737
Go ahead, sit down. Sit down.

23
00:01:37,345 --> 00:01:40,337
I haven't had a chance
to talk to you all day.

24
00:01:41,215 --> 00:01:43,183
How you doing?

25
00:01:43,685 --> 00:01:45,516
How you doing?

26
00:01:47,088 --> 00:01:48,953
What happened to your hand?

27
00:01:49,857 --> 00:01:51,415
This?

28
00:01:52,427 --> 00:01:56,727
I was helping a buddy move a couch.
I slammed it in the doorjamb.

29
00:01:57,865 --> 00:02:00,527
Ways you can manage
to hurt yourself, right?

30
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,565
It's good to see you.

31
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,602
Yeah?

32
00:02:12,714 --> 00:02:14,807
How are our girls holding up?

33
00:02:15,016 --> 00:02:17,109
They're doing okay, I guess.

34
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:20,651
That Celeste, she's a godsend.
You thank her for me, will you?

35
00:02:32,433 --> 00:02:36,335
It's nice, isn't it? Just to sit out here.

36
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:39,936
Yeah.

37
00:02:44,912 --> 00:02:48,905
I couldn't stand looking through the fridge
to find room for all that food...

38
00:02:49,117 --> 00:02:52,052
...we're gonna throw away
in the next few days.

39
00:02:52,353 --> 00:02:55,550
-Lot of waste, huh?
-Yeah.

40
00:02:56,924 --> 00:03:01,190
I just can't let anything get fucked up
in these next few days.

41
00:03:01,796 --> 00:03:06,290
Because it's all anybody
will remember about her.

42
00:03:12,473 --> 00:03:15,909
One thing you could say about Katie,
even when she was little...

43
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:19,170
...that girl was neat.

44
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,108
When I got out of the joint...

45
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:28,455
...you know, after Marita died...

46
00:03:29,957 --> 00:03:34,951
...I remember, I was more afraid
of my little daughter...

47
00:03:36,097 --> 00:03:38,793
...than I ever was of being in prison.

48
00:03:47,241 --> 00:03:49,471
I loved her...

49
00:03:50,745 --> 00:03:52,713
...most...

50
00:03:55,383 --> 00:03:58,841
...because when we were sitting in that
kitchen that night...

51
00:04:01,756 --> 00:04:07,888
...it was like we were the last two people
on Earth. You know, forgotten.

52
00:04:08,563 --> 00:04:10,690
Unwanted.

53
00:04:12,767 --> 00:04:17,136
And it's really starting to piss me off, Dave,
because I can't cry for her.

54
00:04:17,305 --> 00:04:21,401
My own little daughter,
and I can't even cry for her.

55
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,177
Jimmy.

56
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,185
You're crying now.

57
00:04:37,425 --> 00:04:39,552
Yeah, damn.

58
00:04:44,632 --> 00:04:47,601
I just want to hug her one more time.

59
00:04:51,305 --> 00:04:55,002
She was 19 fucking years old.

60
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,284
Do you want me to leave you alone?

61
00:05:05,286 --> 00:05:07,754
No, just stay here for a minute,
if that's cool.

62
00:05:08,956 --> 00:05:12,551
Yeah, sure. Jimmy, it's cool.

63
00:05:29,377 --> 00:05:32,210
When was the last time
you saw Katie Markum?

64
00:05:32,547 --> 00:05:35,983
-You don't think I'd hurt her do you?
-She isn't hurt. She's dead.

65
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,983
-I didn't kill her.
-Again, when's the last time you saw her?

66
00:05:45,192 --> 00:05:48,457
About 8--
Saturday night, about 8:00.

67
00:05:48,763 --> 00:05:50,754
About like 8, Brendan, or at 8?

68
00:05:51,499 --> 00:05:53,296
It was about 8.

69
00:05:54,302 --> 00:05:59,296
We had a couple slices at Hi-Fi,
and she had to go meet Eve and Diane.

70
00:05:59,674 --> 00:06:02,973
Yeah. Why doesn't Jimmy Markum
like you?

71
00:06:04,579 --> 00:06:06,206
I don't know.

72
00:06:07,048 --> 00:06:11,747
But he told Katie he never wanted her
to see me or any other Harris.

73
00:06:11,953 --> 00:06:15,889
What? That thief thinks he's better
than our family?

74
00:06:16,057 --> 00:06:20,357
-He's not a thief.
-He's a thief! A scumbag burglar.

75
00:06:20,928 --> 00:06:24,694
Daughter probably had the same bad gene.
You count yourself lucky, Bren.

76
00:06:25,433 --> 00:06:29,961
So Katie had some brochures for Vegas.
We heard she was going there with you.

77
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:34,130
We were gonna leave Sunday.

78
00:06:35,376 --> 00:06:38,277
We were gonna get married
when we got there.

79
00:06:40,548 --> 00:06:42,880
Well, that was the plan, right?

80
00:06:43,184 --> 00:06:46,085
You were gonna leave me?
Without a word?

81
00:06:46,253 --> 00:06:49,347
-Ma, I was gonna tell you.
-Just like your father, huh?

82
00:06:56,364 --> 00:07:00,562
That's my brother, Ray,
and his friend John.

83
00:07:00,735 --> 00:07:03,101
-Hey, boys.
-Hey.

84
00:07:03,337 --> 00:07:05,032
He don't speak.

85
00:07:05,206 --> 00:07:09,506
Father couldn't shut up, but his son's
a mute. Oh, yeah, life's fucking fair.

86
00:07:09,677 --> 00:07:13,773
They're here about Katie. Why don't you
go watch TV or something.

87
00:07:15,116 --> 00:07:19,314
So where were you between 12:30
and 2 a.m. on Sunday morning, Brendan?

88
00:07:20,154 --> 00:07:21,416
I was asleep.

89
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:23,386
Can you confirm that, Mrs. Harris?

90
00:07:27,061 --> 00:07:30,326
I can confirm that he closed his door
at 10:00.

91
00:07:30,498 --> 00:07:33,296
He came down for breakfast at 9.

92
00:07:34,135 --> 00:07:38,765
I can't confirm that he didn't open
his window and go down the fire escape.

93
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:43,103
Okay, we're gonna ask you to take
a polygraph. You think you'd be up for that?

94
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,305
I loved her so much.

95
00:07:50,418 --> 00:07:53,148
I'm never gonna feel that again.

96
00:07:53,921 --> 00:07:56,116
It doesn't happen twice.

97
00:07:58,359 --> 00:08:00,589
Doesn't happen once most times.

98
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:03,960
Celeste.

99
00:08:05,066 --> 00:08:09,059
-Sorry, Jimmy. You surprised me.
-What are you still doing here?

100
00:08:11,872 --> 00:08:13,499
I don't know.

101
00:08:14,341 --> 00:08:17,310
I don't know, I just....

102
00:08:18,512 --> 00:08:20,343
Did Annabeth get to sleep?

103
00:08:20,715 --> 00:08:23,240
Yeah, I convinced her to take a pill.

104
00:08:23,417 --> 00:08:26,409
-Could I get one of those?
-Yeah.

105
00:08:31,592 --> 00:08:34,060
One for the road and then home.

106
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:43,130
Jimmy, I can stay over if you want.
Sit up with Annabeth.

107
00:08:43,304 --> 00:08:45,135
You've done enough.

108
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,637
To you and Dave for being here for this.

109
00:09:08,763 --> 00:09:12,130
Okay, Jimmy. I'll be back.

110
00:09:13,434 --> 00:09:16,369
I'll be by first thing tomorrow.
See you first thing.

111
00:09:16,537 --> 00:09:18,198
Good night.

112
00:09:19,173 --> 00:09:21,767
-Good night.
-Yeah, good night.

113
00:09:41,495 --> 00:09:42,928
Hello?

114
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,726
Christ. Lauren, say something.

115
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,674
"Okay. Hey, Sean, how was your day? "

116
00:09:59,446 --> 00:10:03,177
Oh, me? I'm tired of wishing things
made sense.

117
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:08,447
I'm tired of caring about some dead girl, and
there's just gonna be another one after her.

118
00:10:09,623 --> 00:10:14,083
Sending killers to jail is sending them where
they've been heading all their lives.

119
00:10:14,261 --> 00:10:16,286
The dead are still dead.

120
00:10:18,933 --> 00:10:21,265
Jesus, l...

121
00:10:21,435 --> 00:10:23,562
...can't do this tonight.

122
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,634
I just....

123
00:10:26,707 --> 00:10:28,470
I can't do it.

124
00:10:28,843 --> 00:10:30,640
Bye, baby.

125
00:10:41,355 --> 00:10:42,982
Because...

126
00:10:44,124 --> 00:10:47,616
...sometimes the man wasn't a man at all.

127
00:10:47,828 --> 00:10:49,523
He was the boy.

128
00:10:50,464 --> 00:10:53,490
The boy who escaped from wolves.

129
00:10:54,568 --> 00:10:57,162
An animal of the dusk.

130
00:10:57,471 --> 00:10:59,336
Invisible.

131
00:10:59,773 --> 00:11:01,638
Silent.

132
00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:04,302
Living in a world...

133
00:11:04,478 --> 00:11:06,810
...the others never saw.

134
00:11:08,749 --> 00:11:11,217
World of fireflies.

135
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:17,280
Unseen except as a flare
in the corner of your eye.

136
00:11:17,992 --> 00:11:22,395
Vanished by the time
you turn your head toward it.

137
00:11:33,974 --> 00:11:38,843
I just gotta get my head right.

138
00:11:41,782 --> 00:11:45,013
Catch a nice, long sleep.

139
00:11:45,486 --> 00:11:48,455
And the boy will go back to his forest.

140
00:11:50,557 --> 00:11:53,651
Back to his fireflies.

141
00:12:01,201 --> 00:12:02,634
Is he asleep?

142
00:12:24,224 --> 00:12:26,624
How's Jimmy and everybody?

143
00:12:27,728 --> 00:12:29,423
Okay.

144
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,459
It's weird.

145
00:12:31,932 --> 00:12:35,868
Took something like this for me and him
to become friends again.

146
00:12:36,036 --> 00:12:38,470
Dave? Dave.

147
00:12:41,742 --> 00:12:43,733
There's still nothing in the paper.

148
00:12:44,345 --> 00:12:46,074
About what?

149
00:12:47,047 --> 00:12:48,275
About what?

150
00:12:51,018 --> 00:12:55,284
I don't know, honey. Maybe I didn't
hurt him as bad as I thought.

151
00:12:55,689 --> 00:12:58,317
He's a mugger. He's not going
to the hospital.

152
00:13:01,362 --> 00:13:03,023
Yeah.

153
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,754
Right.

154
00:13:07,034 --> 00:13:09,594
Anyhow, it doesn't matter, does it?

155
00:13:10,404 --> 00:13:12,964
I mean, Katie Markum is dead.

156
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:16,871
That seems more important right now.

157
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,908
I know in my soul I contributed
to your death.

158
00:13:50,944 --> 00:13:53,412
But I don't know how.

159
00:14:13,267 --> 00:14:15,098
Brendan Harris aced his polygraph.

160
00:14:15,269 --> 00:14:17,965
Good. I didn't like him for it,
nor want him for it.

161
00:14:18,138 --> 00:14:19,435
Yeah. Poor fucking kid.

162
00:14:19,606 --> 00:14:23,599
Ballistics will be back in a while.
Meantime, we got a list of bar patrons.

163
00:14:23,777 --> 00:14:26,473
All people who, I'm certain,
are dying to cooperate.

164
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,376
Considering the crime, maybe.

165
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:30,981
Dave Boyle?

166
00:14:31,185 --> 00:14:34,621
Hey, is that the guy you were friends
with as a kid? The car guy?

167
00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:36,351
Could be.

168
00:14:36,523 --> 00:14:39,981
He's a guy to talk to. He knows you.
He won't treat us like cops.

169
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,891
-Clam up for no reason, huh?
-We'll see.

170
00:14:55,142 --> 00:14:56,769
Hey, Boyle!

171
00:14:57,511 --> 00:14:59,911
-What's it been, seven, eight years?
-Yeah.

172
00:15:00,114 --> 00:15:01,581
Yeah. How you doing?

173
00:15:01,915 --> 00:15:03,212
This is my son, Michael.

174
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:05,783
Hey, Michael. How you doing?
My name's Sean.

175
00:15:05,953 --> 00:15:08,751
I'm an old buddy of your dad's. Hi.

176
00:15:09,423 --> 00:15:12,654
-So you still with the staties?
-Homicide. This is my partner.

177
00:15:12,826 --> 00:15:15,556
-Sergeant Powers. How are you?
-So you got a minute?

178
00:15:15,729 --> 00:15:19,995
-We'd love to ask some quick questions.
-I was just gonna walk Michael to school.

179
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:24,103
-I can be back in a few minutes.
-Tell you what, we'll walk with you, okay?

180
00:15:24,271 --> 00:15:25,761
Sure.

181
00:15:27,374 --> 00:15:29,137
So you look good.

182
00:15:29,676 --> 00:15:32,702
-I hear rents are rising.
-Yeah, the yuppies are coming.

183
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,474
They're cutting my dad's old house up
into condos.

184
00:15:35,682 --> 00:15:37,445
We walked by there the other day.

185
00:15:37,651 --> 00:15:39,881
Must be something we could do
to stop them.

186
00:15:40,053 --> 00:15:42,487
A friend of mine says the other day,
he says:

187
00:15:42,656 --> 00:15:47,116
" Neighborhood needs a fucking crime wave.
Get property values where they belong."

188
00:15:47,294 --> 00:15:51,788
Young girls keep getting murdered up in Pen
Park, Mr. Boyle, you might get your wish.

189
00:15:51,965 --> 00:15:54,456
Dave. Call me Dave.

190
00:15:54,635 --> 00:15:56,569
You said the F-word, Dad.

191
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:59,768
Yeah, I know. Walk on up ahead, Michael.

192
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,068
Us guys need to talk. Go on.

193
00:16:03,243 --> 00:16:07,179
-So, what's up, Sean?
-Yeah, you heard about Katie Markum?

194
00:16:07,347 --> 00:16:10,316
Yeah, I was at Jimmy's yesterday.
Celeste is there now.

195
00:16:10,484 --> 00:16:12,577
-Who's Celeste?
-My wife.

196
00:16:12,786 --> 00:16:17,018
-How's Jimmy doing?
-It's hard to tell. You know him.

197
00:16:17,191 --> 00:16:20,558
-Yeah, so the reason we came by--
-Listen, I saw her.

198
00:16:21,361 --> 00:16:25,798
Katie. I don't know if you know that.
At McGill's, the night she died.

199
00:16:25,966 --> 00:16:27,957
That's what we wanted to talk about.

200
00:16:28,135 --> 00:16:32,071
They were at a couple of bars that night.
Your name turned up for McGill's.

201
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:34,537
They put on quite a show
dancing on the bar.

202
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:38,235
-Pretty drunk, huh?
-But it was harmless.

203
00:16:38,445 --> 00:16:41,471
They weren't stripping or nothing.
They were just 19.

204
00:16:41,682 --> 00:16:43,206
What time did they leave?

205
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:46,409
I left at 1. They must've left
15 minutes before me.

206
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,748
-So we'll say 12:45?
-Sounds about right.

207
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:53,419
You see anything unusual
or anyone--?

208
00:16:53,594 --> 00:16:55,255
Michael.

209
00:16:55,762 --> 00:16:57,491
-Like what?
-I don't know.

210
00:16:57,664 --> 00:16:58,995
A guy watching the girls?

211
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,999
A guy with hate in his eyes?
A woman-hater?

212
00:17:03,337 --> 00:17:07,899
No. No, if they hadn't danced on the bar,
it would've been business as usual.

213
00:17:08,075 --> 00:17:11,408
-See you later, Dad.
-You got your milk money?

214
00:17:18,452 --> 00:17:20,443
Fuck, I hated school.

215
00:17:20,954 --> 00:17:22,512
What?

216
00:17:23,924 --> 00:17:27,018
Yeah, me too, Sean.

217
00:17:28,362 --> 00:17:32,696
Just one more thing, Mr. Boyle.
Where did you go after you left McGill's?

218
00:17:32,866 --> 00:17:35,960
-Home.
-Home by 1:15, would you say?

219
00:17:36,136 --> 00:17:38,934
-Roughly. Sure.
-All right.

220
00:17:40,641 --> 00:17:43,701
Yeah, well, thanks a lot, Dave.
We'll grab a beer sometime?

221
00:17:44,177 --> 00:17:47,305
-Yeah, I'd like that, Sean.
-All right.

222
00:17:54,021 --> 00:17:55,579
What?

223
00:17:55,989 --> 00:17:58,355
What happened to him in that car?

224
00:18:05,699 --> 00:18:07,496
Can you believe this?

225
00:18:07,668 --> 00:18:11,661
Man, it's the same as Dunkin' Donuts.
It costs 15 times the price.

226
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,698
You know, you take away love,
money or hate as motives...

227
00:18:16,877 --> 00:18:18,777
...you're not left with a whole lot.

228
00:18:18,945 --> 00:18:21,539
Well, if this Markum thing's random,
I mean, shit.

229
00:18:21,748 --> 00:18:25,946
Yeah, tell me about it. But the old lady,
Prior, she doesn't hear a scream.

230
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:28,087
Hears a gunshot,
before that a "hi"...

231
00:18:28,255 --> 00:18:31,486
...which tells me the girl is either
friendly or she knew him.

232
00:18:31,658 --> 00:18:36,288
She turns into the curb, not too fast or she
hops it. Foot's off the clutch. She stalls.

233
00:18:36,463 --> 00:18:40,331
-She says, "Hi." He shoots her.
-She slams the door into him, takes off.

234
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,162
What makes her swerve
without hitting the brakes?

235
00:18:43,337 --> 00:18:45,965
-I don't know. Something in the street.
-Maybe.

236
00:18:46,139 --> 00:18:49,370
This Markum girl couldn't have
weighed more than what, 110?

237
00:18:49,576 --> 00:18:53,876
-She hit hard enough to get a jump on him?
-Maybe he's knocked back on his heels.

238
00:18:54,047 --> 00:18:57,574
Your pal Dave strikes me as a guy
permanently back on his heels.

239
00:18:57,784 --> 00:19:00,981
Wait a second, how did we get to
Dave Boyle all of a sudden?

240
00:19:01,154 --> 00:19:03,850
-We just got to him.
-He's a guy who was in the bar.

241
00:19:04,024 --> 00:19:06,788
The last place, Seany,
the last place she was at.

242
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,087
The guy is wrong. You saw his hand.

243
00:19:09,262 --> 00:19:12,925
Yeah, I saw his hand. You seriously
want to take a look at Dave Boyle?

244
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,261
Just a little one.

245
00:19:20,273 --> 00:19:24,505
I'd recommend two sets of visiting hours,
from 3 to 5, and 7 to 9.

246
00:19:24,678 --> 00:19:26,839
-Sure.
-Good.

247
00:19:28,415 --> 00:19:33,216
-Have you thought about flowers?
-I'll call Knopfler's this afternoon.

248
00:19:33,553 --> 00:19:34,884
Good.

249
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,194
And the notice?

250
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:44,394
Notice?

251
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:50,668
Yes, the obituary. We can take care of it
if you give us her basic information.

252
00:19:50,837 --> 00:19:53,397
Or if you prefer donations
in lieu of flowers?

253
00:19:53,573 --> 00:19:55,268
Where's my daughter?

254
00:19:57,778 --> 00:19:59,837
Downstairs, in the basement.

255
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,977
I wanna see her.

256
00:20:49,329 --> 00:20:51,661
I'm gonna find him, Katie.

257
00:20:53,175 --> 00:20:56,183
I'm gonna find him before the police do.

258
00:20:56,594 --> 00:20:59,188
I'm gonna find the man,
and I'm gonna kill him.

259
00:21:03,133 --> 00:21:05,693
Did you say something, Mr. Markum?

260
00:21:09,139 --> 00:21:11,073
The notice.

261
00:21:12,376 --> 00:21:14,742
It should read: "Katherine Markum...

262
00:21:16,413 --> 00:21:19,905
...beloved daughter
of James and Marita, deceased...

263
00:21:20,651 --> 00:21:24,917
...stepdaughter of Annabeth, sister to--"

264
00:21:25,256 --> 00:21:28,692
"Sister to Sara and Nadine."

265
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:13,093
-You guys again?
-Yeah. We're like two bad pennies.

266
00:22:14,038 --> 00:22:16,336
-You dropping in on Jimmy?
-Yeah.

267
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:19,304
Do you have some kind of, what,
break in the case?

268
00:22:19,476 --> 00:22:22,445
No, just paying our respects.
Where you off to?

269
00:22:22,646 --> 00:22:27,242
Annabeth got a craving for cigarettes. I'm
gonna go get some. See you in a minute.

270
00:22:27,451 --> 00:22:31,285
By the way, Mr. Boyle, what happened
to your hand there?

271
00:22:32,957 --> 00:22:37,724
Garbage disposal. It jammed, I stuck
my hand in, it started again.

272
00:22:37,895 --> 00:22:39,590
-Stupid.
-Painful.

273
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,300
Garbage disposal. Bullshit.

274
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:50,429
Yeah. Well, it doesn't mean
he killed anybody either. Come on.

275
00:23:04,088 --> 00:23:07,057
-Heard you could use one.
-Thanks.

276
00:23:08,425 --> 00:23:12,759
-I quit 10 years ago, you believe this?
-Whatever you need right now.

277
00:23:14,498 --> 00:23:16,489
Come on in, I'll get Jimmy.

278
00:23:21,739 --> 00:23:24,833
I got a couple errands I gotta run.
I'll be back in an hour.

279
00:23:25,042 --> 00:23:27,704
You don't have to come back, Celeste.
I'll be fine.

280
00:23:27,878 --> 00:23:29,038
-Sure?
-Celeste Boyle?

281
00:23:29,213 --> 00:23:30,680
Yeah.

282
00:23:30,848 --> 00:23:34,249
I'm Sean Devine, an old friend of Dave's.
This is Whitey Powers.

283
00:23:34,418 --> 00:23:37,444
-Mrs. Boyle.
-Nice to meet you.

284
00:23:37,621 --> 00:23:39,111
Look, I gotta go.

285
00:23:41,992 --> 00:23:45,723
Oh, damn it.
I left my report pad in the cruiser.

286
00:23:45,896 --> 00:23:48,456
-You better go get it.
-Yeah.

287
00:23:49,299 --> 00:23:50,766
Come on.

288
00:23:55,906 --> 00:23:59,342
Hey, Celeste, could I ask you
a quick question?

289
00:23:59,943 --> 00:24:02,343
-Me?
-What time did Dave get home on Saturday?

290
00:24:02,513 --> 00:24:04,140
-What?
-It's a little thing.

291
00:24:04,314 --> 00:24:08,045
We're running a time line on everything
involving Katie. I'm sure...

292
00:24:08,218 --> 00:24:10,277
...Dave told you he saw her
at McGill's.

293
00:24:11,855 --> 00:24:14,016
You think Dave killed Katie?

294
00:24:14,491 --> 00:24:17,722
Oh, no. God. I didn't say that.
Why would I even think that?

295
00:24:20,164 --> 00:24:23,600
-I don't know.
-No, no. It's just that we could figure out...

296
00:24:23,801 --> 00:24:27,328
...what time she was on the road
if we knew what time Dave got home.

297
00:24:27,504 --> 00:24:30,701
See, it's 5 minutes from your place
to McGill's...

298
00:24:30,874 --> 00:24:34,310
...and Katie left 15 minutes
before Dave did. You see what I mean.

299
00:24:34,812 --> 00:24:36,279
I was asleep.

300
00:24:38,949 --> 00:24:44,182
Saturday night, when Dave came in,
I was asleep.

301
00:24:44,354 --> 00:24:46,686
Okay. Well, thanks.

302
00:24:57,434 --> 00:24:59,129
Bullshit.

303
00:24:59,336 --> 00:25:00,826
No, he was dating Katie, Jim.

304
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:04,667
They were gonna elope to Vegas.
We found tickets under their names.

305
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:06,536
Brendan Harris confirmed it.

306
00:25:07,044 --> 00:25:08,306
Remember what you said?

307
00:25:08,779 --> 00:25:13,307
How she looked at you on Saturday like
she was preparing to never see you again?

308
00:25:14,918 --> 00:25:18,752
-Did Brendan Harris kill my daughter?
-No.

309
00:25:18,922 --> 00:25:20,514
You're 100 percent sure?

310
00:25:21,191 --> 00:25:25,491
Passed his poly with flying colors, plus it
seemed to me like he really loved her.

311
00:25:28,499 --> 00:25:31,400
Jimmy, I'm just curious, man.

312
00:25:31,602 --> 00:25:34,002
Why are you so dead set
against that kid?

313
00:25:34,204 --> 00:25:37,833
He said Katie told him you'd disowned her
if she ever dated a Harris.

314
00:25:39,543 --> 00:25:42,671
I knew his father. They called him
"Just Ray" Harris.

315
00:25:42,846 --> 00:25:44,211
Why is that?

316
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:48,878
There were so many Rays
in the neighborhood.

317
00:25:49,052 --> 00:25:53,182
You had "Crazy Ray" Bucheck,
" Psycho Ray" Dorian.

318
00:25:54,224 --> 00:25:57,387
The cool names were taken,
so he got stuck with "Just Ray."

319
00:25:57,561 --> 00:26:00,359
We never got along.
I flat out didn't like him.

320
00:26:01,231 --> 00:26:06,032
And he cut out on his wife when she was
pregnant with that little mute of hers.

321
00:26:06,503 --> 00:26:08,164
I don't know.

322
00:26:08,472 --> 00:26:11,373
I just figure the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

323
00:26:11,642 --> 00:26:16,670
I didn't want Brendan or any other Harris
dating Katie or any other daughter of mine.

324
00:26:18,849 --> 00:26:21,647
I can't believe we're talking about
Just Ray Harris.

325
00:26:21,819 --> 00:26:24,379
How about this? We've interviewed
witnesses...

326
00:26:24,555 --> 00:26:26,682
...canvassed people
who were in the bar.

327
00:26:26,857 --> 00:26:30,884
We've run into more than a few of them
who were questioned...

328
00:26:31,061 --> 00:26:34,553
...before us by one or more
of the Savage brothers.

329
00:26:34,731 --> 00:26:37,996
-So?
-So the Savages are not policemen, Jim.

330
00:26:38,202 --> 00:26:41,933
-Some people don't talk to policemen, Sean.
-With all due respect, Mr. Markum.

331
00:26:42,105 --> 00:26:44,596
...and just so we're clear,
this is our case.

332
00:26:45,375 --> 00:26:47,809
-How long?
-How long what?

333
00:26:48,145 --> 00:26:50,579
How long before you catch
my daughter's killer?

334
00:26:50,747 --> 00:26:52,078
You bargaining with us?

335
00:26:53,917 --> 00:26:55,214
Bargaining?

336
00:26:56,954 --> 00:26:58,751
You giving us a deadline?

337
00:27:01,758 --> 00:27:05,592
We'll speak for Katie, Mr. Markum.
If that's okay with you.

338
00:27:06,797 --> 00:27:11,325
Just find my daughter's killer, sergeant.
I'm not standing in your way.

339
00:27:15,138 --> 00:27:19,074
The last thing we need is Jimmy Markum
and the Savages putting the fear of God...

340
00:27:19,243 --> 00:27:22,303
-...into the neighborhood.
-We grew up terrified of them.

341
00:27:22,479 --> 00:27:26,074
Eleven months apart, like their mother ran
a loose-cannon factory.

342
00:27:26,283 --> 00:27:28,751
Fucking knuckleheads.

343
00:27:31,788 --> 00:27:33,881
Hey, Guys. Ballistics are in on the Markum murder.

344
00:27:34,057 --> 00:27:37,424
-Yeah, you got a match?
-You're gonna love it.

345
00:27:38,595 --> 00:27:41,962
It's a perfect match.
Gun was a.38 Smith.

346
00:27:42,132 --> 00:27:46,432
Part of a lot stolen from a gun dealer
in New Hampshire in 1982.

347
00:27:46,603 --> 00:27:51,734
The same gun that killed Katherine Markum
was used in a liquor-store holdup in 1984.

348
00:27:51,909 --> 00:27:53,274
-ln Buckingham.
-The Flats?

349
00:27:53,443 --> 00:27:58,073
Rome Basin. Place called Looney Liquors.
I pulled the file.

350
00:27:58,248 --> 00:28:02,344
It was a two-man job.
They fired a warning shot into a wall.

351
00:28:02,552 --> 00:28:06,113
-That's where the bullet got pulled.
-Nice work.

352
00:28:06,323 --> 00:28:08,416
Thought you'd like that.

353
00:28:38,155 --> 00:28:40,089
It's okay, Ray.

354
00:28:40,857 --> 00:28:42,688
Don't worry about it.

355
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,071
Ma said that?

356
00:29:00,644 --> 00:29:01,906
That I'm better off?

357
00:29:07,751 --> 00:29:10,686
I loved her! You know what that's like?

358
00:29:11,121 --> 00:29:12,349
Huh?

359
00:29:17,527 --> 00:29:19,392
I'm sorry.

360
00:29:27,471 --> 00:29:29,302
No, you're wrong.

361
00:29:30,474 --> 00:29:32,738
I won't ever feel that again.

362
00:29:33,477 --> 00:29:38,676
Right there. Went in through a bottle
of Jack and stuck in the wall right there.

363
00:29:38,882 --> 00:29:42,784
-Scary, huh?
-Scarier than a glass of milk, right?

364
00:29:42,953 --> 00:29:45,444
So take me through it.
These two guys come in....

365
00:29:45,689 --> 00:29:49,523
In rubber masks.
They came in through here.

366
00:29:51,862 --> 00:29:54,387
That's the storeroom.

367
00:29:55,399 --> 00:29:59,096
There's a door back there
that leads to a loading dock.

368
00:29:59,403 --> 00:30:01,633
I always keep that door locked.

369
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:05,308
So they must have had a key.

370
00:30:05,475 --> 00:30:09,411
A key? So, what you're saying
is that it was an inside job?

371
00:30:09,579 --> 00:30:13,845
It had to be. One of them, at least,
worked for me at some point.

372
00:30:14,051 --> 00:30:18,750
The only reason they fired that goddamn
warning shot was they must have known...

373
00:30:19,189 --> 00:30:20,918
...I kept this under the counter.

374
00:30:21,091 --> 00:30:24,720
-And you told the police that at the time.
-Yeah.

375
00:30:25,662 --> 00:30:28,187
Sure, they went through
my employment records.

376
00:30:28,365 --> 00:30:30,959
Questioned everybody
who used to work for me.

377
00:30:31,134 --> 00:30:34,194
-Never made an arrest.
-Still have a copy of those records?

378
00:30:34,371 --> 00:30:39,308
Yeah, it's in a box in the office there.
But I know who did it.

379
00:30:39,476 --> 00:30:40,943
Oh, yeah?

380
00:30:41,111 --> 00:30:43,841
This guy I fired a couple
of weeks before.

381
00:30:44,014 --> 00:30:47,950
Son of a bitch came in here
a few days after the robbery.

382
00:30:48,085 --> 00:30:52,351
He had this fucking goddamn grin
on his face.

383
00:30:52,522 --> 00:30:54,581
And I just knew.

384
00:30:54,758 --> 00:30:57,454
Go tell a grin to a jury, right?

385
00:30:58,161 --> 00:30:59,992
You remember his name?

386
00:31:00,997 --> 00:31:02,965
Do I look senile to you?

387
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:05,631
-No, sir.
-Name...

388
00:31:05,836 --> 00:31:07,804
...was Ray Harris.

389
00:31:08,171 --> 00:31:11,197
We used to call him "Just Ray."

390
00:31:13,977 --> 00:31:17,003
You say they used the same gun
for another crime?

391
00:31:18,048 --> 00:31:21,711
-That's correct, sir.
-Thanks for your help, Mr. Looney.

392
00:31:33,697 --> 00:31:35,562
Where you been?

393
00:31:36,867 --> 00:31:38,562
Out.

394
00:31:41,805 --> 00:31:43,796
What you watching?

395
00:31:43,974 --> 00:31:46,067
Some vampire movie.

396
00:31:46,776 --> 00:31:49,336
Guy just got his head torn off.

397
00:31:51,114 --> 00:31:53,275
Where'd you go, Celeste?

398
00:31:57,654 --> 00:31:59,884
I was sitting in my car...

399
00:32:00,357 --> 00:32:03,520
...down by the channel.
You know...

400
00:32:04,161 --> 00:32:05,594
...thinking about things.

401
00:32:07,364 --> 00:32:10,731
-What'd you think about?
-Oh, you know....

402
00:32:11,134 --> 00:32:14,126
No, actually, I don't know.

403
00:32:19,876 --> 00:32:23,175
Things. You know, the day.

404
00:32:24,848 --> 00:32:27,646
About Katie being dead.

405
00:32:28,251 --> 00:32:31,118
And poor Annabeth and Jimmy, you know...

406
00:32:31,821 --> 00:32:33,686
...those things.

407
00:32:34,057 --> 00:32:36,048
Those things.

408
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,294
Know what I was thinking about, huh?

409
00:32:40,931 --> 00:32:42,421
Vampires.

410
00:32:44,167 --> 00:32:45,429
What about them?

411
00:32:47,304 --> 00:32:50,432
They're undead...

412
00:32:50,607 --> 00:32:53,667
...but I think maybe there's
something beautiful about it.

413
00:32:53,843 --> 00:32:57,370
Maybe one day you wake up
and you forget what it's like...

414
00:32:57,581 --> 00:32:59,446
...to be human.
Maybe then it's okay.

415
00:33:00,884 --> 00:33:03,079
What the fuck you talking about, Dave?

416
00:33:03,453 --> 00:33:05,853
Vampires, sweetie. Werewolves.

417
00:33:06,022 --> 00:33:08,081
You're not making any sense.

418
00:33:11,127 --> 00:33:12,856
You think I killed Katie?

419
00:33:13,029 --> 00:33:15,156
-Celeste.
-What--?

420
00:33:15,365 --> 00:33:19,563
-ls that the sense we're making these days?
-Where'd you come up with that?

421
00:33:19,736 --> 00:33:23,137
You've barely looked at me since you found
out Katie was dead.

422
00:33:23,306 --> 00:33:25,035
In fact, you seem repulsed by me.

423
00:33:25,208 --> 00:33:26,971
-Dave!
-What?

424
00:33:27,143 --> 00:33:31,876
I don't think anything.
I'm confused, okay?

425
00:33:32,048 --> 00:33:33,845
Even your friend Sean
asked about--

426
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:36,109
He's not my friend, if you didn't know.

427
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:40,949
He asked me about you.
What time you came home.

428
00:33:41,625 --> 00:33:45,356
-What'd you tell him?
-I said I was asleep.

429
00:33:45,929 --> 00:33:49,057
-That's good thinking, baby.
-Jesus Christ, Dave!

430
00:33:49,232 --> 00:33:52,167
-Why don't you tell them about the mugger?
-The mugger?

431
00:33:52,335 --> 00:33:54,929
The mugger! I see how
your mind's working. I do.

432
00:33:55,105 --> 00:33:58,302
I come home with blood on me
the same night Katie's murdered.

433
00:33:58,475 --> 00:34:00,136
I must have killed her, right?

434
00:34:00,577 --> 00:34:02,272
Fuck!

435
00:34:30,106 --> 00:34:31,596
Henry....

436
00:34:32,242 --> 00:34:34,733
What? Henry?

437
00:34:37,013 --> 00:34:39,481
Henry and George.

438
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:45,414
I never told anyone that before.

439
00:34:47,324 --> 00:34:48,757
Those were their names.

440
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,920
Isn't that fucking hilarious?

441
00:34:56,099 --> 00:34:59,091
At least that's what they called themselves,
but...

442
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:03,831
...they were wolves, and Dave...

443
00:35:04,507 --> 00:35:08,466
...was the boy who escaped from wolves.

444
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,841
What are you talking about, Dave?

445
00:35:13,383 --> 00:35:15,783
I'm talking Henry and George.

446
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:19,584
They took me on a four-day ride.

447
00:35:20,323 --> 00:35:25,659
They buried me in this ratty old cellar
with a sleeping bag.

448
00:35:26,496 --> 00:35:29,397
And, man, Celeste...

449
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,328
...did they have their fun.

450
00:35:33,269 --> 00:35:36,670
And no one came to help old Dave then.

451
00:35:38,675 --> 00:35:43,442
Dave had to pretend to be somebody else.

452
00:35:48,485 --> 00:35:51,079
You mean, all those years ago...

453
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:56,424
...when you were a little boy?

454
00:35:58,094 --> 00:35:59,721
Dave....

455
00:35:59,896 --> 00:36:01,955
Dave's dead.

456
00:36:03,333 --> 00:36:07,394
I don't know who came out of that cellar,
but it sure as shit wasn't Dave!

457
00:36:08,772 --> 00:36:10,205
You see, honey--

458
00:36:10,373 --> 00:36:11,863
Fuck!

459
00:36:12,142 --> 00:36:14,736
It's like vampires.

460
00:36:17,781 --> 00:36:19,772
Once it's in you...

461
00:36:21,251 --> 00:36:23,151
...it stays.

462
00:36:24,554 --> 00:36:26,579
What stays?

463
00:36:33,263 --> 00:36:36,460
Did you know there were child prostitutes
in Rome Basin?

464
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:38,800
What?

465
00:36:44,607 --> 00:36:46,097
Fuck!

466
00:36:49,412 --> 00:36:52,347
I can't trust my mind anymore, Celeste.

467
00:36:52,515 --> 00:36:54,540
I'm warning you...

468
00:36:56,386 --> 00:36:58,217
...I can't trust my mind.

469
00:37:01,191 --> 00:37:05,127
I gotta go out,
try to get my head around it.

470
00:37:06,896 --> 00:37:08,386
Okay.

471
00:37:12,936 --> 00:37:14,426
Okay.

472
00:37:14,904 --> 00:37:16,303
Okay.

473
00:37:18,007 --> 00:37:21,909
-The gun sends us in a different direction.
-I don't see it that way.

474
00:37:22,078 --> 00:37:24,638
What does Just Ray's gun
have to do with Dave?

475
00:37:24,814 --> 00:37:26,611
These things get passed around.

476
00:37:26,783 --> 00:37:29,775
Just Ray may have blown town,
but his gun never did.

477
00:37:29,953 --> 00:37:32,854
I say we talk with Brendan Harris
in the morning.

478
00:37:33,022 --> 00:37:37,083
And I say Dave Boyle. The hand story.
The wife, she's definitely scared.

479
00:37:37,293 --> 00:37:41,753
They're hiding something, but Dave Boyle's
as much a killer as Brendan Harris.

480
00:37:41,931 --> 00:37:46,095
Boyle fits the profile, a fucking T.
Mid-30s, white, marginally employed...

481
00:37:46,269 --> 00:37:50,399
...sexually abused as a kid.
On paper, this guy should be in jail already.

482
00:37:50,573 --> 00:37:52,939
Katie Markum
was not sexually abused, see?

483
00:37:53,109 --> 00:37:56,476
In that equation,
sexual emission is part of the deal.

484
00:37:56,646 --> 00:38:00,639
You were friends when you were kids.
This makes you a fucking liability.

485
00:38:00,817 --> 00:38:02,114
He's not my friend.

486
00:38:02,285 --> 00:38:06,745
Turns out you're right, I'll have my cuffs
off my hip faster than yours.

487
00:38:21,337 --> 00:38:22,964
Hey, Jimmy.

488
00:38:24,207 --> 00:38:25,731
You're out late.

489
00:38:25,909 --> 00:38:27,638
Yeah, you too.

490
00:38:29,078 --> 00:38:30,875
It's cold, huh?

491
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:33,375
Yeah, I guess.

492
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:42,448
You know, l....

493
00:38:42,992 --> 00:38:44,983
I been sitting out here...

494
00:38:45,194 --> 00:38:47,287
...over the last few years...

495
00:38:49,232 --> 00:38:53,328
...waiting on Katie to get back
from someplace.

496
00:38:54,304 --> 00:38:59,298
About midnight, I'd say to Annabeth,
"I'm gonna go sit on the porch for a while."

497
00:39:03,913 --> 00:39:05,710
Weird thing is...

498
00:39:06,549 --> 00:39:08,574
...it seemed to bring her back.

499
00:39:13,122 --> 00:39:15,147
I saw her, you know.

500
00:39:17,026 --> 00:39:18,687
Saw who?

501
00:39:18,928 --> 00:39:22,022
Katie. I was at McGill's Saturday night.

502
00:39:24,033 --> 00:39:28,129
-You saw Katie Saturday night?
-Never got around to telling you.

503
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,835
Did you talk to her?

504
00:39:33,643 --> 00:39:36,134
Just nodded hello at one point.

505
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,505
Next time I looked up, she was gone.

506
00:39:45,755 --> 00:39:47,222
But...

507
00:39:47,423 --> 00:39:48,981
...Jimmy...

508
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,394
...she looked...

509
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:55,220
...happy.

510
00:40:12,181 --> 00:40:15,344
I got more walking to do.
Good night.

511
00:40:27,263 --> 00:40:30,494
-You stole his car.
-His car was officially towed.

512
00:40:30,667 --> 00:40:34,501
-From the front of his house.
-No! It was abandoned in Rome Basin...

513
00:40:34,671 --> 00:40:36,161
...adjacent to the parkway.

514
00:40:36,339 --> 00:40:40,901
Lucky for us, the parkway's state
jurisdiction. Some kids jacked the car...

515
00:40:41,077 --> 00:40:44,638
-...they took it for a joy ride....
-What? Why'd you do it?

516
00:40:44,814 --> 00:40:49,774
After I left you last night, I decided to talk
to Boyle myself, put some fear into him.

517
00:40:49,952 --> 00:40:54,719
I get to his house, I decide to look in
his car, see what he's got. I find blood.

518
00:40:54,891 --> 00:40:57,587
-Blood?
-Front seat of Dave's car. B-negative.

519
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,594
-How much?
-A bit. Found more in the trunk. A lot more.

520
00:41:01,764 --> 00:41:04,631
Type O, same type as Katie Markum.

521
00:41:04,801 --> 00:41:07,463
Wait, Katie Markum
never got in anybody's trunk.

522
00:41:07,637 --> 00:41:10,401
She was chased through the park
where she died.

523
00:41:10,573 --> 00:41:14,373
-It's enough to ask questions.
-Your search is gonna get tossed out.

524
00:41:14,544 --> 00:41:19,447
No, found and abandoned in state
jurisdiction, for insurance purposes.

525
00:41:19,649 --> 00:41:23,745
-ln the best interest of the owner.
-Get a physical search, file the report.

526
00:41:23,953 --> 00:41:25,420
Bingo.

527
00:41:26,089 --> 00:41:28,751
You wanna talk to him,
or should I send him home?

528
00:41:29,092 --> 00:41:32,118
-Dave's here?
-I've had him in the box for an hour.

529
00:41:32,295 --> 00:41:35,389
Sent two of my biggest, ugliest troopers
to pick him up.

530
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,462
Come on, Mr. Boyle!

531
00:41:38,634 --> 00:41:41,831
We know you didn't get that swollen hand
sticking it in the garbage disposal.

532
00:41:42,472 --> 00:41:47,239
-Oh, yeah? How do you know that?
-Why's your wife afraid of you?

533
00:41:47,777 --> 00:41:50,302
She know what really happened
to your hand?

534
00:41:56,619 --> 00:41:59,520
How about a Sprite or something?

535
00:41:59,689 --> 00:42:03,682
How about you tell us what really happened
Saturday night, Mr. Boyle?

536
00:42:03,893 --> 00:42:05,383
You lied.

537
00:42:05,595 --> 00:42:08,063
That's your opinion,
which you're entitled to.

538
00:42:08,231 --> 00:42:13,134
-Hey, you think this is funny?
-No, I don't. I'm tired, I'm hung-over.

539
00:42:13,302 --> 00:42:17,739
Not only was my car stolen last night,
but now you won't release it to me.

540
00:42:17,907 --> 00:42:19,499
Okay.

541
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:22,671
All right.

542
00:42:23,146 --> 00:42:26,309
Tell us, Mr. Boyle,
how did you get the blood in your car?

543
00:42:26,516 --> 00:42:29,144
-What blood?
-Let's start with the front seat.

544
00:42:31,087 --> 00:42:33,055
What are you looking at him for?

545
00:42:34,557 --> 00:42:38,220
Hey, you think I could get
that Sprite, Sean?

546
00:42:38,995 --> 00:42:40,462
Sure.

547
00:42:40,797 --> 00:42:42,788
Oh, I get it.

548
00:42:43,432 --> 00:42:45,263
You're the good cop.

549
00:42:45,768 --> 00:42:48,794
How about a meatball sub
while you're at it?

550
00:42:49,005 --> 00:42:52,202
I ain't your bitch, Dave.
Looks like you'll have to wait.

551
00:42:53,309 --> 00:42:56,574
Yeah, but you're someone's bitch,
aren't you, Sean?

552
00:42:58,781 --> 00:43:02,239
The blood on your front seat, Dave.
Answer the sergeant.

553
00:43:05,021 --> 00:43:08,081
We got a chainlink fence
in our back yard.

554
00:43:08,257 --> 00:43:11,454
Me and my kid play Wiffle Ball
every afternoon after school.

555
00:43:12,094 --> 00:43:16,258
He's getting good, so most of the balls
are on the other side of the fence.

556
00:43:16,432 --> 00:43:19,094
So I climb it.
Except I slip...

557
00:43:19,268 --> 00:43:22,465
...slice myself where the links curl in,
right here.

558
00:43:22,638 --> 00:43:24,435
Bled like hell.

559
00:43:24,841 --> 00:43:28,106
Ten minutes later,
I gotta pick up Michael at school.

560
00:43:28,711 --> 00:43:31,874
Probably was still bleeding
when I got in the front seat.

561
00:43:32,048 --> 00:43:33,743
What blood type are you?

562
00:43:34,417 --> 00:43:36,078
B-negative.

563
00:43:36,352 --> 00:43:39,048
Yeah? That's the match we got.

564
00:43:39,655 --> 00:43:41,680
-Well, there you go.
-Not quite.

565
00:43:41,891 --> 00:43:44,359
Blood in the trunk of the car
wasn't B-negative.

566
00:43:45,761 --> 00:43:48,559
I don't know anything
about any blood in the trunk of the car.

567
00:43:49,232 --> 00:43:52,429
No idea how half a pint of blood
got in the trunk of your car?

568
00:43:52,602 --> 00:43:55,765
-None.
-This is not the way you wanna go, Dave.

569
00:43:55,938 --> 00:43:57,633
How is that gonna look in court?

570
00:43:57,807 --> 00:44:01,709
You not knowing how someone else's blood
got in the trunk of your car?

571
00:44:01,878 --> 00:44:04,813
Gonna look fine, I suppose.
You filed the report.

572
00:44:05,314 --> 00:44:07,111
What report?

573
00:44:07,483 --> 00:44:11,783
The stolen-car report.
The car wasn't in my possession last night.

574
00:44:12,121 --> 00:44:15,181
So whatever the thieves used it for,
you should find out...

575
00:44:15,391 --> 00:44:17,985
...because it sounds like they
were up to no good.

576
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,458
Things looking any better
on the Sprite, Sean?

577
00:44:27,737 --> 00:44:31,264
Well, you just got too fucking smart.
The car is inadmissible.

578
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,102
Anything in there, his lawyers say
was put by the car thieves.

579
00:44:34,277 --> 00:44:36,871
-I can break him.
-You just kicked their asses in there!

580
00:44:37,046 --> 00:44:39,207
You still think your old buddy Dave
wouldn't hurt a fly--

581
00:44:39,415 --> 00:44:41,645
-ls that the point? No.
-What is the fucking point?

582
00:44:41,817 --> 00:44:45,810
We can break this open on the gun.
It's the gun.

583
00:44:46,188 --> 00:44:48,554
Okay. Maybe.

584
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,721
So, what do we do with Dave?

585
00:44:54,397 --> 00:44:55,921
Fuck it. Kick him loose.

586
00:44:56,799 --> 00:45:00,735
Maybe a Celtic cross.
That's always a popular choice.

587
00:45:00,937 --> 00:45:04,202
Or this lovely red marble here.

588
00:45:05,074 --> 00:45:06,837
Or a figural.

589
00:45:07,009 --> 00:45:08,567
That one.

590
00:45:09,078 --> 00:45:12,570
Very good. Nice and simple.

591
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:22,682
Hey, Jimmy!

592
00:45:26,128 --> 00:45:28,289
Annabeth said you were here.

593
00:45:29,632 --> 00:45:31,759
We been asking around, like you said to.

594
00:45:31,934 --> 00:45:33,458
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

595
00:45:33,636 --> 00:45:36,833
Jimmy, this ain't about the two-year bit
you did for me.

596
00:45:37,006 --> 00:45:40,100
And it ain't about me missing your brains
running things.

597
00:45:40,184 --> 00:45:44,621
Katie was my niece. Not by birth, but
she was part of our family, we loved her.

598
00:45:44,755 --> 00:45:47,315
I don't question you, Val.
What's up?

599
00:45:48,726 --> 00:45:53,493
Cops are all over this. Doing their job
for once. Bars, street trade, everything.

600
00:45:53,664 --> 00:45:57,122
Every hooker we talked to, bartender,
already been questioned.

601
00:45:57,301 --> 00:46:01,169
-The fucking law has descended, Jimmy.
-What about Just Ray's kid?

602
00:46:01,338 --> 00:46:05,240
Quiet as a mouse.
Kid's no trouble to anyone.
