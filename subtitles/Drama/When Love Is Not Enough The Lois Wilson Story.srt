1
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:53,170
So good of you to come see me, Mr. Bond.
Particularly on such short notice.

2
00:00:54,339 --> 00:00:57,341
If you can't trust a Swiss banker,
what's the world come to?

3
00:00:58,551 --> 00:01:02,471
And now that we're all comfortable,
why don't you sit down?

4
00:01:04,515 --> 00:01:08,018
It was not easy,
but I have retrieved the money.

5
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,105
No doubt, Sir Robert will be
pleased to see it again.

6
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,651
At the current rate of exchange,
minus the fees

7
00:01:15,735 --> 00:01:18,403
and certain unforeseeable expenses.

8
00:01:19,489 --> 00:01:23,116
-Voilà, the receipt.
-Would you like to check my figures?

9
00:01:24,994 --> 00:01:27,204
Oh, I'm sure they're perfectly rounded.

10
00:01:28,706 --> 00:01:31,541
-It's all there.
-I didn't come for the money.

11
00:01:32,877 --> 00:01:37,047
The report Sir Robert bought was stolen
from an Ml6 agent who was killed for it.

12
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:42,469
I want to know who killed him.

13
00:01:42,553 --> 00:01:45,305
-Terrible tragedy.
-I just want a name.

14
00:01:45,515 --> 00:01:48,850
I am merely the middleman.
I'm just trying to do the honorable thing,

15
00:01:48,935 --> 00:01:51,395
returning the money to its rightful owner.

16
00:01:52,021 --> 00:01:54,982
And we know how difficult that can be
for a Swiss banker.

17
00:02:00,446 --> 00:02:04,282
I am offering you the opportunity
to walk out with the money, Mr. Bond.

18
00:02:04,575 --> 00:02:07,828
And I'm giving you the opportunity
to walk out with your life.

19
00:02:08,246 --> 00:02:11,206
Looking at our present situation,
strictly as a banker,

20
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:14,668
I would have to say
that the numbers are not on your side.

21
00:02:15,378 --> 00:02:20,465
Perhaps you failed to take into account
my hidden assets.

22
00:02:31,102 --> 00:02:33,395
You seem to have had
a small reversal of fortune.

23
00:02:34,313 --> 00:02:36,440
-Give me the name.
-I can't tell you.

24
00:02:36,607 --> 00:02:38,275
Let's count to three.

25
00:02:39,068 --> 00:02:44,281
You can do that, can't you? One, two...

26
00:02:45,575 --> 00:02:48,118
All right. All right.
But you'll have to protect me.

27
00:04:48,406 --> 00:04:51,741
James. Have you brought me
a souvenir from your trip?

28
00:04:52,201 --> 00:04:54,578
Chocolates? An engagement ring?

29
00:04:56,038 --> 00:04:57,914
I thought you'd enjoy one of these.

30
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,625
How romantic.

31
00:05:03,212 --> 00:05:04,880
I know exactly where to put that.

32
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:10,927
Oh, Moneypenny,

33
00:05:11,095 --> 00:05:15,473
the story of our relationship.
Close, but no cigar.

34
00:05:16,058 --> 00:05:18,602
I hate to tear you away
from affairs of state, 007.

35
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:19,811
Would you mind coming in?

36
00:05:22,273 --> 00:05:23,607
Right away, M.

37
00:05:25,818 --> 00:05:27,527
Sir Robert King, James Bond.

38
00:05:28,821 --> 00:05:32,616
The man who retrieved my money.
I can't thank you enough. Excellent work.

39
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:35,577
Be careful, M.
I might try to steal him from you.

40
00:05:35,661 --> 00:05:38,788
Construction's not exactly my speciality.

41
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,790
Quite the opposite, in fact.

42
00:05:42,126 --> 00:05:43,376
Best to the family.

43
00:05:48,466 --> 00:05:52,010
-Old friend?
-We read law at Oxford together.

44
00:05:53,304 --> 00:05:57,349
I always knew he'd conquer the world.
Care for a drink?

45
00:05:57,642 --> 00:05:58,934
Yes, thank you.

46
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:02,187
He's a man of great integrity.

47
00:06:02,647 --> 00:06:05,315
Who buys stolen reports
for three million pounds.

48
00:06:06,234 --> 00:06:07,317
Thank you.

49
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:11,321
-Any leads on the sniper?
-Not one.

50
00:06:11,656 --> 00:06:14,824
Professional job.
She must be working for someone.

51
00:06:15,701 --> 00:06:18,078
-Is this the stolen report?
-Yes. Classified.

52
00:06:18,162 --> 00:06:20,080
From the Russian
Atomic Energy Department.

53
00:06:20,164 --> 00:06:21,748
What would King want this for?

54
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:25,418
He was led to believe the document was
a secret report

55
00:06:25,503 --> 00:06:26,878
identifying the terrorists

56
00:06:26,963 --> 00:06:30,173
who'd attacked a new oil pipeline
he's building in the region.

57
00:06:30,675 --> 00:06:31,841
Interesting.

58
00:06:33,302 --> 00:06:34,469
But it doesn't exactly explain

59
00:06:34,553 --> 00:06:36,888
why someone would want me
out of their office alive.

60
00:06:45,564 --> 00:06:49,693
-King! The money.
-Moneypenny, stop King.

61
00:06:57,868 --> 00:07:00,328
Move! Move, move! Get out of the way!

62
00:07:05,167 --> 00:07:06,459
Stop!

63
00:07:43,289 --> 00:07:47,000
Move! Move! Get out of the way!
Get out of the way! Move!

64
00:07:55,092 --> 00:07:58,219
Stop, stop! It isn't finished!

65
00:11:42,236 --> 00:11:43,611
What was that?

66
00:13:04,318 --> 00:13:05,485
Let's go!

67
00:13:05,694 --> 00:13:07,654
-What the hell do you think you're...
-Let go!

68
00:13:36,725 --> 00:13:39,686
Listen to me! You can't get away.

69
00:13:39,937 --> 00:13:42,397
We can make a deal.
Just tell me who's behind this.

70
00:13:42,481 --> 00:13:45,066
Who are you working for? Don't do it!

71
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:47,944
Don't blow us up! I can protect you.

72
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:50,363
Do you understand? I can protect you.

73
00:13:50,447 --> 00:13:51,823
Not from him!

74
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,157
Hello, my dear.

75
00:17:34,004 --> 00:17:37,340
-Who is that young woman?
-King's daughter.

76
00:17:38,675 --> 00:17:41,177
-Elektra.
-Thank you.

77
00:17:44,181 --> 00:17:46,349
The money was dipped in urea.

78
00:17:47,517 --> 00:17:49,518
In effect, a highly compacted
fertilizer bomb.

79
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:52,313
Having handled the money,
the water on 007's hands

80
00:17:52,397 --> 00:17:55,232
when he touched the ice
started a chemical reaction.

81
00:17:55,317 --> 00:17:58,069
In one of the notes,
the metal anti-counterfeiting strip

82
00:17:58,153 --> 00:18:01,030
had been replaced with magnesium,
which acted as a detonator.

83
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:04,659
And King's lapel pin
was switched for a copy

84
00:18:04,743 --> 00:18:08,329
which contained a radio transmitter
to trigger the blast.

85
00:18:08,413 --> 00:18:12,583
In other words,
he set off the bomb that killed him.

86
00:18:12,668 --> 00:18:14,919
We know it was someone close to King,

87
00:18:15,587 --> 00:18:18,297
and our only lead committed suicide
on that balloon.

88
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:23,511
But given the size of King's organization,
it could be anyone, anywhere.

89
00:18:24,554 --> 00:18:25,554
M.

90
00:18:28,392 --> 00:18:30,059
This will not stand.

91
00:18:31,228 --> 00:18:34,563
We will not be terrorized by cowards
who'd murder an innocent man

92
00:18:34,648 --> 00:18:36,065
and use us as the tool.

93
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,442
We'll find the people
who committed this atrocity.

94
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,904
We'll follow them to the farthest ends
of the earth, if needs be.

95
00:18:43,031 --> 00:18:45,157
And we will bring them to justice.

96
00:18:58,755 --> 00:18:59,839
Tanner!

97
00:18:59,923 --> 00:19:02,091
Sorry, James.
M says you're off the active-duty list

98
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:03,926
until you're cleared by medical.

99
00:19:09,641 --> 00:19:11,308
Dislocated collarbone.

100
00:19:11,518 --> 00:19:15,021
If any more tendons snap, I'm afraid
you're going to be out of action for weeks.

101
00:19:18,734 --> 00:19:22,445
Molly, I need a clean bill of health.

102
00:19:23,447 --> 00:19:25,448
You have to clear me for duty.

103
00:19:26,283 --> 00:19:30,327
-James, that wouldn't really be...
-Ethical?

104
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:34,165
Practical, smart.

105
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:39,128
Well, let's just skirt the issue, shall we?

106
00:19:42,257 --> 00:19:45,718
You'd have to promise to call me
this time.

107
00:19:46,595 --> 00:19:48,596
Whatever the doctor orders.

108
00:19:49,806 --> 00:19:52,600
Then I suppose,
if you stayed in constant contact...

109
00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:53,934
Of course.

110
00:19:54,227 --> 00:19:56,854
If you showed sufficient stamina.

111
00:19:57,814 --> 00:20:01,400
-Cut out all kinds of...
-Strenuous activity?

112
00:20:23,298 --> 00:20:26,550
I suppose we all have to
pay the piper sometime, right, Q?

113
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,928
Oh, pipe down, 007.

114
00:20:29,763 --> 00:20:34,308
-Was it something I said?
-No. Something you destroyed.

115
00:20:34,392 --> 00:20:39,271
My fishing boat
for my retirement away from you.

116
00:20:41,983 --> 00:20:45,402
Now, I want to introduce you
to the young fellow

117
00:20:45,487 --> 00:20:47,696
I'm grooming to follow me.

118
00:20:59,376 --> 00:21:01,001
Helps if you open the door.

119
00:21:02,212 --> 00:21:05,589
-And you might be?
-This is 007!

120
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:08,259
If you're Q, does that make him R?

121
00:21:08,343 --> 00:21:12,221
Yes, the legendary 007 wit.

122
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,723
Or at least half of it.

123
00:21:14,808 --> 00:21:19,645
Now, I dare say, 007, that you've
met your match with this machine.

124
00:21:19,729 --> 00:21:23,232
Yeah? New model? Improved specs?

125
00:21:24,234 --> 00:21:27,236
I thought you were on the inactive roster.
Some kind of injury?

126
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,363
Yes, well, we'll see about that. So?

127
00:21:29,447 --> 00:21:33,075
As I was saying, the very latest
in interception countermeasures.

128
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:36,996
Titanium armor,
a multitasking heads-up display

129
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:42,585
and six beverage cup holders.
All in all, rather stocked.

130
00:21:43,253 --> 00:21:46,755
-"Fully loaded," I think is the term.
-I think...

131
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,426
You're not here to think.
You're here to do what I tell you.

132
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,597
Now, go put on the coat
and demonstrate it for 007.

133
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,265
But of course.

134
00:21:56,558 --> 00:21:59,393
Now, watch closely, please, 007.

135
00:22:00,228 --> 00:22:03,272
The right arm goes
in the right sleeve, thus.

136
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:07,026
And the left arm in the left sleeve, thus.

137
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:10,654
Now, note closely, please,
pockets, poppers and zipper.

138
00:22:11,114 --> 00:22:14,575
Take the lower part of the zipper
and insert it into the...

139
00:22:14,659 --> 00:22:16,285
Pull the tag.

140
00:22:18,246 --> 00:22:19,455
You said...

141
00:22:24,628 --> 00:22:26,837
He seems well-suited for the job.

142
00:22:29,174 --> 00:22:34,595
You're not retiring anytime soon,
are you?

143
00:22:34,971 --> 00:22:36,847
Now, pay attention, 007.

144
00:22:37,265 --> 00:22:39,475
I've always tried to teach you two things.

145
00:22:39,768 --> 00:22:42,561
First, never let them see you bleed.

146
00:22:43,355 --> 00:22:47,107
-And the second?
-Always have an escape plan.

147
00:23:00,914 --> 00:23:04,500
Good evening.
The Elektra King kidnap ordeal is over.

148
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,419
The Cyprus authorities say
she has escaped

149
00:23:07,504 --> 00:23:10,714
after shooting dead
two of her captors and is...

150
00:23:14,928 --> 00:23:16,053
He shouted.

151
00:23:18,932 --> 00:23:20,724
Shouted all the time.

152
00:24:12,068 --> 00:24:13,902
Level one, clearance required.

153
00:24:15,113 --> 00:24:16,739
Level one, clearance required.

154
00:24:21,995 --> 00:24:23,245
Yes, 007?

155
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:26,290
Tell me about the kidnapping
of Elektra King.

156
00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:28,917
I wasn't aware you had an assignment
on this case.

157
00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:31,170
I brought the money in that killed King.

158
00:24:31,838 --> 00:24:34,715
-Don't make this personal.
-I'm not. Are you?

159
00:24:38,136 --> 00:24:40,554
You're the only one
who could seal her file.

160
00:24:44,309 --> 00:24:45,768
Will you excuse us?

161
00:24:52,776 --> 00:24:55,444
I will not tolerate insubordination, 007.

162
00:25:02,702 --> 00:25:03,786
What happened?

163
00:25:06,831 --> 00:25:09,625
After Elektra King was kidnapped,

164
00:25:10,543 --> 00:25:15,130
her father tried to deal with it on his own,
with no success.

165
00:25:16,883 --> 00:25:18,342
So he came to me.

166
00:25:29,437 --> 00:25:32,981
As you are aware,
we do not negotiate with terrorists.

167
00:25:34,984 --> 00:25:41,156
And against every instinct in my heart,
every emotion as a mother,

168
00:25:41,658 --> 00:25:46,161
I told him not to pay the ransom.
I thought we had time on our side.

169
00:25:48,998 --> 00:25:50,749
You used the girl as bait.

170
00:25:53,545 --> 00:25:54,545
Yes.

171
00:25:55,422 --> 00:25:58,298
The money in King's briefcase
was precisely the same amount

172
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:01,552
as the ransom demand for his daughter.

173
00:26:07,725 --> 00:26:12,146
It's a message. Your terrorist is back.

174
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:24,867
-Victor Zokas, a.k.a...
-Renard, the anarchist.

175
00:26:25,034 --> 00:26:29,288
He was operating in Moscow in 1996.
Pyongyang, North Korea, before that.

176
00:26:29,372 --> 00:26:33,125
And he's been spotted
in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Iraq, Iran,

177
00:26:33,209 --> 00:26:35,377
Beirut and Cambodia.

178
00:26:36,254 --> 00:26:40,591
-All the romantic vacation spots.
-His only goal is chaos.

179
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:44,303
After Robert came to me,
I sent 009 to kill Renard.

180
00:26:45,054 --> 00:26:48,056
Before he completed the mission,
Elektra escaped.

181
00:26:49,267 --> 00:26:51,477
A week later,
our man caught up with the target.

182
00:26:51,895 --> 00:26:55,230
He put a bullet in his head.
That bullet's still there.

183
00:26:56,524 --> 00:26:57,816
How did he survive?

184
00:26:58,443 --> 00:27:00,944
The doctor who saved Renard
couldn't get the bullet out,

185
00:27:01,196 --> 00:27:02,738
so Renard killed him.

186
00:27:03,948 --> 00:27:06,408
It's moving through
the medulla oblongata,

187
00:27:06,493 --> 00:27:09,953
killing off his senses, touch, smell.

188
00:27:10,038 --> 00:27:11,622
He feels no pain.

189
00:27:11,706 --> 00:27:14,958
He can push himself harder, longer
than any normal man.

190
00:27:15,293 --> 00:27:16,793
The bullet will kill him,

191
00:27:16,878 --> 00:27:20,088
but he'll grow stronger every day,
until the day he dies.

192
00:27:24,427 --> 00:27:27,804
Robert is dead. Ml6 is humiliated.

193
00:27:28,348 --> 00:27:29,848
He's had his revenge.

194
00:27:31,726 --> 00:27:32,935
Not quite.

195
00:27:33,895 --> 00:27:36,313
Renard had three enemies
in that kidnapping,

196
00:27:37,524 --> 00:27:39,608
and there's still one he hasn't touched.

197
00:27:41,444 --> 00:27:42,611
Elektra.

198
00:27:44,614 --> 00:27:45,614
M.

199
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:53,121
I see the good doctor has cleared you.
Notes you have exceptional stamina.

200
00:27:54,457 --> 00:27:56,667
I'm sure she was touched
by his dedication

201
00:27:58,878 --> 00:28:00,587
to the job in hand.

202
00:28:02,924 --> 00:28:05,050
007, I want you to go to Elektra.

203
00:28:05,802 --> 00:28:09,721
She's taken over the construction of
her father's oil pipeline in the Caspian Sea.

204
00:28:09,806 --> 00:28:11,807
Find who switched that pin.

205
00:28:12,225 --> 00:28:14,643
If your instincts are right,
Renard will be back,

206
00:28:15,311 --> 00:28:17,229
and Elektra will be the next target.

207
00:28:18,106 --> 00:28:19,606
The worm on the hook again.

208
00:28:19,691 --> 00:28:22,568
She doesn't need to know
it's the same man that may be after her.

209
00:28:22,652 --> 00:28:24,027
Don't frighten her.

210
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,071
A shadow operation?

211
00:28:26,197 --> 00:28:29,825
Remember, shadows stay
in front or behind,

212
00:28:30,618 --> 00:28:31,868
never on top.

213
00:29:34,349 --> 00:29:37,100
You, go back. Leave. This area is closed.

214
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,186
I'm here to see Elektra King.

215
00:29:39,395 --> 00:29:41,563
James Bond, Universal Exports.

216
00:29:41,731 --> 00:29:44,107
And I'm Davidov, chief of security.

217
00:29:44,317 --> 00:29:47,069
As you can see, we're having
some problems with the villagers.

218
00:29:48,196 --> 00:29:51,198
I told Miss King to stay
at the office in Baku.

219
00:29:52,325 --> 00:29:53,575
Oh, hell.

220
00:30:13,888 --> 00:30:16,932
-Miss King, I told you to stay...
-I know what you told me.

221
00:31:04,188 --> 00:31:05,480
Send the pipe around.

222
00:31:05,565 --> 00:31:08,191
It's going to take weeks and cost millions.

223
00:31:08,401 --> 00:31:11,987
-Your father approved this route.
-Then my father was wrong. Do it.

224
00:31:13,156 --> 00:31:14,865
-Davidov.
-I'll talk to her.

225
00:31:18,703 --> 00:31:20,912
I saw you at my father's funeral.

226
00:31:21,414 --> 00:31:23,665
Yes. I'm sorry.

227
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,502
M told me she was sending someone. Mr...

228
00:31:28,171 --> 00:31:30,672
Bond. James Bond.

229
00:31:33,009 --> 00:31:37,137
-Did you know my father?
-I met him once, briefly.

230
00:31:38,055 --> 00:31:40,766
You seem to have inherited
his touch for diplomacy.

231
00:31:40,975 --> 00:31:44,519
-Saving the church?
-And avoiding the bloodshed.

232
00:31:45,188 --> 00:31:48,815
A hundred years ago, my mother's family
discovered the oil here.

233
00:31:49,025 --> 00:31:51,359
When the Soviet Union was formed,

234
00:31:51,694 --> 00:31:56,198
the Communists spent the next 70 years
plundering our countryside for it.

235
00:31:57,033 --> 00:31:59,367
I saw the mess they left on the drive in.

236
00:31:59,827 --> 00:32:02,579
The new pipeline
will guarantee our future.

237
00:32:03,873 --> 00:32:07,375
But it would be a crime to destroy
what little is left of our past.

238
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,426
But you didn't come here
to talk about oil, did you?

239
00:32:16,511 --> 00:32:17,511
No.

240
00:32:18,137 --> 00:32:19,304
Tell me,

241
00:32:22,308 --> 00:32:24,851
have you ever lost a loved one, Mr. Bond?

242
00:32:27,897 --> 00:32:30,816
M sent me because we're afraid
your life might be in danger.

243
00:32:34,737 --> 00:32:37,322
Please, I want to show you something.

244
00:32:37,782 --> 00:32:41,952
I'm trying to build an 800-mile
pipeline through Turkey,

245
00:32:42,411 --> 00:32:46,748
past the terrorists in Iraq, Iran and Syria.

246
00:32:47,124 --> 00:32:51,086
Up here, the Russians have
three competing pipelines.

247
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,338
And they'll do anything to stop me.

248
00:32:53,756 --> 00:32:57,133
My father was murdered,
the villagers are rioting,

249
00:32:57,802 --> 00:33:02,264
and you, Mr. Bond, have come all this way
to tell me that I "might" be in danger?

250
00:33:06,102 --> 00:33:08,395
We suspect there might be an insider.

251
00:33:10,898 --> 00:33:13,733
-My father's pin.
-No, a duplicate

252
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,362
with a transmitter inside
that set off the bomb.

253
00:33:17,613 --> 00:33:20,824
My family has relied
on Ml6 twice, Mr. Bond.

254
00:33:21,284 --> 00:33:23,451
I won't make that mistake a third time.

255
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:29,708
I'm going to finish building this pipeline,

256
00:33:29,792 --> 00:33:31,543
and I don't need your help.

257
00:33:31,961 --> 00:33:35,046
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to check the survey lines.

258
00:33:35,131 --> 00:33:37,549
I've always wanted to
check the survey lines.

259
00:33:38,384 --> 00:33:40,552
You don't take no for an answer, do you?

260
00:33:41,053 --> 00:33:42,053
No.

261
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,808
I hope you know how to ski, then.

262
00:33:48,144 --> 00:33:50,645
I came prepared for a cold reception.

263
00:34:07,997 --> 00:34:10,332
Can't land. Wind's too strong.

264
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:12,250
Hold her steady.

265
00:35:19,777 --> 00:35:23,655
-You ski very well, Mr. Bond.
-Seems you enjoy being chased.

266
00:35:24,615 --> 00:35:28,451
-It probably happens all the time.
-Less often than you might think.

267
00:35:29,412 --> 00:35:32,956
So this is where they meet,
the two ends of the pipeline.

268
00:35:33,499 --> 00:35:34,833
Your father's legacy.

269
00:35:35,042 --> 00:35:38,420
My family's legacy to the world.

270
00:35:48,764 --> 00:35:51,266
-Expecting visitors?
-No.

271
00:35:58,899 --> 00:36:00,900
This isn't a social call.

272
00:36:01,402 --> 00:36:04,946
Head for the gully.
I'll lead them into the trees. Go, go!

273
00:38:07,444 --> 00:38:09,237
See you back at the lodge.

274
00:39:28,692 --> 00:39:29,901
-Oh, my God!
-It's all right.

275
00:39:29,985 --> 00:39:31,819
-We're buried alive!
-It's all right!

276
00:39:34,406 --> 00:39:38,493
-I can't stay here!
-You're not going to. You're not going to.

277
00:39:39,995 --> 00:39:41,371
-Elektra.
-I can't breathe.

278
00:39:41,455 --> 00:39:44,123
-Elektra, Elektra, Elektra!
-I can't breathe! I can't breathe!

279
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:47,335
Look at me. Elektra, look at me!
Look at my eyes.

280
00:39:47,503 --> 00:39:50,338
Look at my eyes. Look at my eyes!

281
00:39:51,131 --> 00:39:52,382
You're all right.

282
00:39:53,634 --> 00:39:57,845
Everything's all right. Trust me. Okay?

283
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:27,625
She's fine.

284
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:29,961
Some bumps and bruises,
but otherwise fine.

285
00:40:30,045 --> 00:40:32,547
She wants to see you.
Not you, Davidov, him.

286
00:40:46,812 --> 00:40:50,315
-Are you all right?
-I need to ask you something.

287
00:40:51,692 --> 00:40:53,943
And I want you to tell me the truth.

288
00:40:54,153 --> 00:40:57,322
Who is it? Who's trying to kill me?

289
00:40:58,365 --> 00:41:02,160
I told you I don't know.
But I'm gonna find him.

290
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:04,579
Not good enough.

291
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:09,083
After the kidnapping, I was afraid.

292
00:41:09,585 --> 00:41:12,003
I was afraid to go outside.
I was afraid to be alone.

293
00:41:12,087 --> 00:41:14,422
I was afraid to be in a crowd.

294
00:41:15,174 --> 00:41:17,258
I was afraid to do anything at all.

295
00:41:17,384 --> 00:41:21,429
Until I realized
I can't hide in the shadows.

296
00:41:22,014 --> 00:41:25,767
I can't let fear run my life. I won't.

297
00:41:27,269 --> 00:41:31,147
After I find him, you won't have to.

298
00:41:33,734 --> 00:41:37,278
Don't go. Stay with me.

299
00:41:39,782 --> 00:41:40,907
Please?

300
00:41:45,579 --> 00:41:46,954
I can't do that.

301
00:41:47,998 --> 00:41:50,083
I thought it was your job to protect me.

302
00:41:52,878 --> 00:41:56,130
-You'll be safe here.
-I don't want to be safe.

303
00:42:03,722 --> 00:42:05,264
I'll be back soon.

304
00:42:07,309 --> 00:42:09,811
And who's afraid now, Mr. Bond?

305
00:43:21,717 --> 00:43:25,720
-I want to see Valentin Zukovsky.
-Impossible.

306
00:43:27,014 --> 00:43:30,475
Vodka martini. Shaken, not stirred.

307
00:43:32,561 --> 00:43:34,520
Tell him James Bond is here.

308
00:43:35,939 --> 00:43:37,106
Now.

309
00:43:42,905 --> 00:43:44,822
I don't think you heard me.

310
00:43:54,625 --> 00:43:57,168
Mr. Zukovsky would be delighted
to see you.

311
00:44:02,049 --> 00:44:06,093
-After you.
-No. After you.

312
00:44:07,304 --> 00:44:09,055
I insist.

313
00:44:11,558 --> 00:44:13,142
And a little for you.

314
00:44:16,438 --> 00:44:18,231
Bond! James Bond!

315
00:44:18,941 --> 00:44:22,151
Meet Nina and Verushka.

316
00:44:23,445 --> 00:44:26,781
Lose the girls, Valentin. We need to talk.

317
00:44:27,282 --> 00:44:31,619
Why am I suddenly worried
that I'm not carrying enough insurance?

318
00:44:31,828 --> 00:44:33,246
Chill out, James.

319
00:44:37,668 --> 00:44:40,127
Fine, ladies. Go on. Beat it. Scram.

320
00:44:40,295 --> 00:44:42,213
Bull, give them an inch.

321
00:44:49,429 --> 00:44:52,306
And make sure they lose it in this casino.

322
00:44:54,476 --> 00:44:56,394
I'll see you later, Mr. Bond.

323
00:44:56,603 --> 00:44:58,813
I see you put your money
where your mouth is.

324
00:44:59,648 --> 00:45:03,776
Mr. Bullion does not trust banks.
So, what would you like to talk about?

325
00:45:04,403 --> 00:45:08,155
I'm not sure I can really help you.
I'm a legitimate businessman now.

326
00:45:10,534 --> 00:45:14,120
Would you care for some caviar?
My own brand, Zukovsky's Finest.

327
00:45:15,539 --> 00:45:16,872
Take a look at this.

328
00:45:19,668 --> 00:45:21,711
Russian Special Services.

329
00:45:23,088 --> 00:45:27,216
Atomic Energy Antiterrorist Unit.
Where did you find this?

330
00:45:27,426 --> 00:45:31,178
I took it off a parahawk which tried to
kill Elektra King this morning.

331
00:45:32,014 --> 00:45:33,681
Renard is behind this.

332
00:45:39,146 --> 00:45:41,731
I think you and I had better have a drink.

333
00:45:47,654 --> 00:45:49,363
And then after Afghanistan,

334
00:45:49,448 --> 00:45:53,784
the KGB decided Renard was a liability
and just cut him loose.

335
00:45:53,869 --> 00:45:56,871
-Now he works freelance.
-But for whom?

336
00:45:58,373 --> 00:46:00,291
There are four competing pipelines.

337
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:04,045
I'm willing to bet half the customers
in this casino would be very happy

338
00:46:04,129 --> 00:46:06,589
to see the King pipeline disappear.

339
00:46:08,592 --> 00:46:09,800
-What's funny?
-Nothing.

340
00:46:09,885 --> 00:46:13,387
It just appears Miss King does not share
your concern.

341
00:46:21,313 --> 00:46:25,149
-What are you doing here?
-The same thing you are.

342
00:46:25,275 --> 00:46:27,693
Looking for the people
who tried to kill me.

343
00:46:27,944 --> 00:46:30,071
Let me take you home. Now.

344
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,240
No. I want them to see I'm not frightened.

345
00:46:33,408 --> 00:46:38,537
Miss King, how very nice to see you.
We've kept your father's chair free.

346
00:46:38,747 --> 00:46:41,540
Free?
Nothing comes free from you, Zukovsky.

347
00:46:42,626 --> 00:46:46,128
Your father had a credit line with us,
$1 million U.S.

348
00:46:46,546 --> 00:46:49,090
I'd be happy to extend you that courtesy.

349
00:46:53,178 --> 00:46:54,428
So what's it to be?

350
00:46:56,515 --> 00:46:58,599
Blackjack, your father's favorite?

351
00:46:59,476 --> 00:47:01,102
Let's keep it simple.

352
00:47:02,104 --> 00:47:04,522
One card. High draw.

353
00:47:08,443 --> 00:47:10,069
A million dollars.

354
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:17,118
Wait. Bury the top three cards.

355
00:47:19,788 --> 00:47:21,872
You're determined to protect me,
aren't you?

356
00:47:21,957 --> 00:47:24,542
Perhaps from yourself.
You don't have to do this.

357
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:30,464
There's no point in living
if you can't feel alive.

358
00:47:42,769 --> 00:47:44,061
Queen of hearts.

359
00:47:56,950 --> 00:48:01,662
It appears that you have been beaten
by the ace of clubs.

360
00:48:06,168 --> 00:48:09,211
No hard feelings, my dear.
Come again soon.

361
00:48:15,302 --> 00:48:16,552
Shall we?

362
00:48:16,845 --> 00:48:22,183
Elektra, this is a game
I can't afford to play.

363
00:48:25,145 --> 00:48:26,312
I know.

364
00:48:29,608 --> 00:48:32,610
-What happened to Davidov?
-I gave him the night off.

365
00:48:55,050 --> 00:48:57,009
Welcome to the Devil's Breath.

366
00:48:58,845 --> 00:49:02,223
For thousands of years, Hindu pilgrims
have journeyed to this holy place

367
00:49:04,142 --> 00:49:07,728
to witness the wonder of the miracle
of the natural flames that never die

368
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:12,900
and to test their devotion to God

369
00:49:14,569 --> 00:49:17,571
by holding the scalding rocks
in their hands

370
00:49:20,742 --> 00:49:22,451
as they said their daily prayers.

371
00:49:24,454 --> 00:49:28,249
Tell me, Davidov,
what happened this afternoon?

372
00:49:28,416 --> 00:49:32,545
You promised me your best men.
Mr. Arkov supplied the latest weapons.

373
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:35,756
-Yes, but Bond...
-Bond was unarmed.

374
00:49:38,093 --> 00:49:41,679
And you, Arkov?
Is everything ready for tomorrow?

375
00:49:41,888 --> 00:49:44,431
I have the authorization
and the passes in the car,

376
00:49:44,641 --> 00:49:47,226
and I have arranged for a plane tonight,
but...

377
00:49:47,769 --> 00:49:51,730
-But what?
-We should scrub the rest of the mission.

378
00:49:51,815 --> 00:49:55,192
The parahawks were meant
to be returned.

379
00:49:55,277 --> 00:49:57,611
People will start asking questions,
even of me,

380
00:49:57,696 --> 00:50:00,030
all because of his incompetence.

381
00:50:00,115 --> 00:50:04,034
I see. I see you're right.
You're right, he should be punished.

382
00:50:05,036 --> 00:50:06,787
Davidov, hold this for me.

383
00:50:11,084 --> 00:50:13,544
It was wrong of me to expect
so much of you.

384
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:16,797
Kill him.

385
00:50:19,134 --> 00:50:21,343
He failed his test of devotion.

386
00:50:24,931 --> 00:50:28,434
You can take his place. Take his ID.

387
00:50:30,312 --> 00:50:31,979
And do be on time.

388
00:50:51,958 --> 00:50:53,459
Poor shoulder.

389
00:50:54,669 --> 00:50:56,295
It looks painful.

390
00:50:59,132 --> 00:51:01,008
Needs constant attention.

391
00:51:04,971 --> 00:51:08,265
I knew. I knew when I first saw you.

392
00:51:10,018 --> 00:51:11,560
I knew it would be like this.

393
00:51:24,282 --> 00:51:26,158
Enough ice for one day.

394
00:51:46,388 --> 00:51:48,389
How did you survive?

395
00:51:55,730 --> 00:51:59,066
I seduced the guards, used my body.

396
00:52:00,068 --> 00:52:02,236
It gave me control.

397
00:52:03,822 --> 00:52:06,740
And the rest,
I got a gun and started shooting.

398
00:52:10,537 --> 00:52:13,914
And what about you?
What do you do to survive?

399
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:20,254
I take pleasure

400
00:52:22,007 --> 00:52:23,757
in great beauty.

401
00:55:02,584 --> 00:55:05,419
Let's go. It's getting late.

402
00:55:10,175 --> 00:55:13,427
What happened to Davidov?
I was told to expect him.

403
00:55:15,221 --> 00:55:17,514
He was buried with work.

404
00:55:18,516 --> 00:55:20,767
Let's go. Get your stuff.

405
00:55:32,447 --> 00:55:35,657
Okay, come on. Let's get out of here.

406
00:55:37,535 --> 00:55:41,955
You're late. Did you bring it? The grease.

407
00:55:45,293 --> 00:55:46,835
Of course.

408
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:54,760
Excellent.

409
00:56:12,528 --> 00:56:15,197
Get ready. We're 10 minutes out.

410
00:56:15,281 --> 00:56:17,199
But make sure you wear the ID.

411
00:57:03,579 --> 00:57:05,289
I'm gonna go get some air.

412
00:57:23,057 --> 00:57:26,768
Welcome to Kazakhstan, Dr. Arkov.
I'm a great admirer of your research.

413
00:57:27,478 --> 00:57:30,564
Not often we see someone
of your stature here.

414
00:57:30,648 --> 00:57:32,899
I go where the work takes me.

415
00:57:32,984 --> 00:57:35,360
By the way,
you have the transport documents?

416
00:57:45,121 --> 00:57:47,581
I pulled the plutonium
out of the one inside.

417
00:57:47,665 --> 00:57:50,250
-You can detonate the triggers now.
-Okay.

418
00:57:53,921 --> 00:57:59,259
Look. Our IDA physicist.
Don't bother. Not interested in men.

419
00:57:59,344 --> 00:58:00,969
Take my word for it.

420
00:58:01,054 --> 00:58:03,138
Last year,
we decommissioned four test sites.

421
00:58:03,222 --> 00:58:05,307
Not even a glimmer.

422
00:58:09,604 --> 00:58:13,273
Are you here for a reason
or are you just hoping for a glimmer?

423
00:58:14,025 --> 00:58:15,359
And you are?

424
00:58:15,443 --> 00:58:19,112
Mikhail Arkov,
Russian Atomic Energy Department.

425
00:58:19,197 --> 00:58:24,034
-Miss...
-Dr. Jones. Christmas Jones.

426
00:58:24,118 --> 00:58:27,287
And don't make any jokes.
I've heard them all.

427
00:58:27,372 --> 00:58:29,581
I don't know any doctor jokes.

428
00:58:31,709 --> 00:58:34,544
This is okay.
Take the elevator down the hall.

429
00:58:34,629 --> 00:58:36,797
Your friends are already down there.

430
00:58:36,881 --> 00:58:41,051
-Don't I get some type of protection?
-No, Dr. Arkov.

431
00:58:41,135 --> 00:58:43,011
Down there it's all
weapons-grade plutonium.

432
00:58:43,096 --> 00:58:44,388
Reasonably safe.

433
00:58:44,472 --> 00:58:46,681
Up here we've got hydrogen bombs
that your lab built

434
00:58:46,766 --> 00:58:47,724
leaking tritium,

435
00:58:47,809 --> 00:58:50,227
which I've spent the last six months
trying to clean up.

436
00:58:50,311 --> 00:58:52,604
So if you need any protection at all,
it's from me.

437
00:58:55,817 --> 00:58:57,317
Your friends are waiting for you.

438
00:59:03,491 --> 00:59:04,491
Doctor?

439
00:59:07,036 --> 00:59:08,495
Aren't you forgetting?

440
00:59:11,833 --> 00:59:13,542
Yes, of course. Thank you.

441
00:59:14,335 --> 00:59:15,669
By the way...

442
01:00:34,957 --> 01:00:39,586
Expecting Davidov?
He caught a bullet instead of the plane.

443
01:00:40,087 --> 01:00:43,590
Get off. Keep your mouth shut.

444
01:00:43,674 --> 01:00:45,592
You can't kill me, I'm already dead.

445
01:00:45,676 --> 01:00:48,845
Yeah, not dead enough for me.

446
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:54,017
You could show a little gratitude,
I did spare your life at the banker's office.

447
01:00:54,602 --> 01:00:59,105
That's right. I couldn't kill you.
You were working for me.

448
01:00:59,565 --> 01:01:03,443
You delivered the money, killed King,
and now you brought me the plane.

449
01:01:04,111 --> 01:01:07,489
-What's your plan for the bomb?
-You first.

450
01:01:07,782 --> 01:01:12,202
-Or could it be you don't have a plan?
-That bomb will never leave this room.

451
01:01:13,496 --> 01:01:14,871
Neither will you.

452
01:01:20,586 --> 01:01:25,131
How sad to be threatened by a man
who can't grasp what he's involved in.

453
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:28,927
Revenge is not hard to fathom
for a man who believes in nothing.

454
01:01:29,011 --> 01:01:32,430
And what do you believe in?
Preservation of capital?

455
01:01:32,515 --> 01:01:35,850
Go ahead, shoot me. I'll welcome it.

456
01:01:36,227 --> 01:01:38,853
My men will hear the shot and kill you.

457
01:01:38,938 --> 01:01:41,856
And the firefight will bring down
half the army from above.

458
01:01:42,149 --> 01:01:45,485
But when a certain phone call
isn't made in 20 minutes,

459
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:46,861
Elektra dies.

460
01:01:49,490 --> 01:01:53,410
-You're bluffing.
-She's beautiful, isn't she?

461
01:01:54,078 --> 01:01:57,956
You should have had her before,
when she was innocent.

462
01:01:58,708 --> 01:02:02,669
How does it feel
to know I broke her in for you?

463
01:02:04,714 --> 01:02:07,215
I usually hate killing an unarmed man.

464
01:02:07,425 --> 01:02:09,301
Cold-blooded murder is a filthy business.

465
01:02:09,385 --> 01:02:11,720
A man tires of being executed.

466
01:02:12,805 --> 01:02:16,433
But in your case, I feel nothing,
just like you.

467
01:02:16,642 --> 01:02:20,353
But then again, there's no point living
if you can't feel alive.

468
01:02:23,941 --> 01:02:24,941
Hey!

469
01:02:25,693 --> 01:02:27,861
-Drop the gun!
-Keep away, Colonel.

470
01:02:28,070 --> 01:02:30,947
He's an impostor.
Dr. Arkov is 63 years old.

471
01:02:31,032 --> 01:02:34,826
This is your impostor,
along with the men outside on the plane.

472
01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:36,703
They're stealing the bomb.

473
01:02:38,539 --> 01:02:40,123
I said drop it!

474
01:02:51,010 --> 01:02:52,093
On your knees!

475
01:02:55,473 --> 01:02:56,598
Well done.

476
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:02,228
He would've killed us all.
Did you speak to him?

477
01:03:02,313 --> 01:03:04,898
Yeah, but he's no atomic scientist.

478
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,902
I suppose you were the one
who allowed him down.

479
01:03:18,287 --> 01:03:19,371
You had me,

480
01:03:20,956 --> 01:03:24,918
but I knew you couldn't
shoulder the responsibility.

481
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,593
Now, without any further interruptions,
let's proceed.

482
01:03:33,969 --> 01:03:36,513
There are too many new faces
around here,

483
01:03:36,597 --> 01:03:38,765
including yours.

484
01:03:38,849 --> 01:03:42,102
The bomb doesn't move
until I am satisfied.

485
01:03:42,561 --> 01:03:45,438
Hey, all of you, to the surface, now.

486
01:04:07,628 --> 01:04:08,712
Come on! Go!

487
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:12,465
Move!

488
01:04:19,473 --> 01:04:20,807
They're sealing us in.

489
01:04:23,310 --> 01:04:24,477
Who are you?

490
01:04:25,604 --> 01:04:27,480
I work for the British government.

491
01:04:32,445 --> 01:04:33,570
Stay calm.

492
01:06:37,278 --> 01:06:40,822
No hard feelings, Mr. Bond,
but we're even.

493
01:06:41,282 --> 01:06:44,409
Soon, you'll feel nothing at all.

494
01:07:10,811 --> 01:07:13,521
Seal the door! Close it!

495
01:07:25,951 --> 01:07:27,201
Come on!

496
01:07:48,182 --> 01:07:50,308
Keep going! Move! Hang on!

497
01:07:51,060 --> 01:07:53,269
So, you're a British spy.
Do you have a name?

498
01:07:53,354 --> 01:07:54,520
The name's Bond.

499
01:07:59,902 --> 01:08:01,194
James Bond.

500
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:13,706
Don't stop! Go, go! Jump!

501
01:08:34,770 --> 01:08:36,396
They won't get very far.

502
01:08:36,563 --> 01:08:39,899
Every warhead has a locator card.
We can track the signal.

503
01:08:41,735 --> 01:08:43,403
You mean one of these?

504
01:08:51,078 --> 01:08:53,204
Do we have the range of Renard's plane?

505
01:08:53,414 --> 01:08:55,081
Anywhere in this circle.

506
01:08:55,165 --> 01:08:58,835
Russia, Armenia, Iran,
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan...

507
01:08:58,919 --> 01:09:01,546
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Elektra King is calling from Baku.

508
01:09:01,630 --> 01:09:04,632
-It's on the video line.
-Put her on the wall screen.

509
01:09:09,346 --> 01:09:14,017
I'm sorry. I would never call you,
except James has disappeared.

510
01:09:14,810 --> 01:09:16,894
He left my villa in the middle of the night,

511
01:09:16,979 --> 01:09:22,692
and my head of security has been found

512
01:09:22,776 --> 01:09:25,528
near your local airstrip, murdered.

513
01:09:26,488 --> 01:09:29,782
-I'll send someone out.
-M, could you come?

514
01:09:31,243 --> 01:09:34,954
I can't help thinking I'm next.

515
01:09:39,460 --> 01:09:40,668
-Get me out there.
-No, listen...

516
01:09:40,753 --> 01:09:43,046
Just get me out there.

517
01:10:01,398 --> 01:10:02,523
Gabor?

518
01:10:10,824 --> 01:10:11,824
James?

519
01:10:14,369 --> 01:10:15,578
Surprised?

520
01:10:16,038 --> 01:10:18,164
What are you doing?
What's wrong with you? Are you crazy?

521
01:10:18,248 --> 01:10:21,167
Maybe. Maybe I should ask you.

522
01:10:22,169 --> 01:10:26,422
After all, "there's no point in living
if you can't feel alive."

523
01:10:26,507 --> 01:10:29,175
Isn't that right, Elektra?
Isn’t that your motto?

524
01:10:29,343 --> 01:10:30,384
What are you talking about?

525
01:10:30,469 --> 01:10:31,594
Or did you steal it

526
01:10:31,678 --> 01:10:33,721
-from your old friend Renard?
-What?

527
01:10:33,806 --> 01:10:35,306
He and I had a chat this morning.

528
01:10:35,390 --> 01:10:37,725
Knew all about us.
Knew about my shoulder.

529
01:10:37,810 --> 01:10:39,352
Knew exactly where to hurt me.

530
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:42,063
Are you saying Renard is the man
who's trying to kill me?

531
01:10:42,147 --> 01:10:43,231
Drop the act.

532
01:10:44,691 --> 01:10:45,691
It's over.

533
01:10:47,277 --> 01:10:50,279
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-I think you do.

534
01:10:52,533 --> 01:10:54,617
It's called Stockholm syndrome,

535
01:10:55,786 --> 01:10:57,662
common in kidnappings.

536
01:10:58,163 --> 01:11:02,125
Young, impressionable victim. Sheltered.

537
01:11:03,710 --> 01:11:06,212
Sexually inexperienced.

538
01:11:06,713 --> 01:11:10,550
A powerful kidnapper
skilled in torture, manipulation.

539
01:11:11,927 --> 01:11:14,262
Something snaps in the victim's mind.

540
01:11:15,139 --> 01:11:17,014
The captive falls in love with her captor.

541
01:11:17,391 --> 01:11:18,599
How dare you?

542
01:11:19,601 --> 01:11:22,562
How dare you?
That animal? That monster?

543
01:11:23,230 --> 01:11:25,064
He disgusts me.

544
01:11:26,108 --> 01:11:27,817
You disgust me.

545
01:11:28,735 --> 01:11:31,612
So he knew where to hurt you, is that it?

546
01:11:31,864 --> 01:11:34,240
You had a sling on your arm
at the funeral.

547
01:11:34,741 --> 01:11:37,535
And I didn't have to sleep with you
to find that out.

548
01:11:37,744 --> 01:11:40,580
-He used your exact words.
-So you knew.

549
01:11:41,248 --> 01:11:42,665
You knew all the time
that he was out there,

550
01:11:42,749 --> 01:11:44,333
that he was coming for me,

551
01:11:44,418 --> 01:11:45,626
and you lied.

552
01:11:46,461 --> 01:11:47,920
You used me.

553
01:11:48,547 --> 01:11:50,423
You used me as bait.

554
01:11:53,927 --> 01:11:55,636
And you made love to me.

555
01:11:57,556 --> 01:11:58,764
What?

556
01:11:59,433 --> 01:12:02,768
To pass the time
as you waited for him to strike?

557
01:12:08,859 --> 01:12:09,859
Hello?

558
01:12:15,282 --> 01:12:18,659
He's struck again.
Ten men are dead at the pipeline.

559
01:12:18,827 --> 01:12:20,119
I'm coming with you.

560
01:12:21,288 --> 01:12:23,998
You do what you want to do,
but I've called M.

561
01:12:25,209 --> 01:12:27,251
She's coming to take charge.

562
01:12:41,767 --> 01:12:43,059
Oh, no.

563
01:12:56,990 --> 01:12:59,408
I want an update. Where do we stand?

564
01:13:00,327 --> 01:13:03,496
One of Renard's men removed
the locator card from the bomb

565
01:13:03,664 --> 01:13:05,164
so we can't track it. But...

566
01:13:05,332 --> 01:13:06,582
But what?

567
01:13:07,251 --> 01:13:08,626
With all due respect,

568
01:13:09,503 --> 01:13:11,337
I don't think you should be here.

569
01:13:12,506 --> 01:13:15,841
May I remind you
that you're the reason I'm here, 007.

570
01:13:16,176 --> 01:13:18,719
You disobeyed a direct order
and left that girl alone.

571
01:13:18,804 --> 01:13:21,806
Perhaps that girl isn't as innocent
as you think.

572
01:13:21,890 --> 01:13:24,558
-What are you saying?
-Suppose the inside man,

573
01:13:24,768 --> 01:13:29,397
the one who switched King's lapel pin,
turned out to be an inside woman?

574
01:13:32,276 --> 01:13:34,902
She kills her father
and attacks her own pipeline?

575
01:13:34,987 --> 01:13:37,363
-Why? To what end?
-I don't know, yet.

576
01:13:43,704 --> 01:13:45,621
Rig Station 11 - RS

577
01:13:45,706 --> 01:13:48,124
Look at that. That's not right.

578
01:13:49,251 --> 01:13:52,295
-What is it?
-An observation rig.

579
01:13:52,504 --> 01:13:56,090
-Travels in the pipe looking for cracks.
-Shut it down.

580
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:01,470
I don't understand. It won't respond.

581
01:14:01,888 --> 01:14:03,806
The place is clean. No sign of the bomb.

582
01:14:03,890 --> 01:14:06,475
-The bomb is in the pipeline.
-Oh, my God!

583
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:09,395
They must have brought it through here.
That would explain the attack.

584
01:14:09,563 --> 01:14:10,938
Heading for the oil terminal.

585
01:14:11,023 --> 01:14:12,898
Where it would do the most damage.

586
01:14:12,983 --> 01:14:14,984
Have your men evacuate that terminal.

587
01:14:17,237 --> 01:14:18,904
So now do you believe me?

588
01:14:21,366 --> 01:14:24,160
This is an emergency situation.
So, please,

589
01:14:24,244 --> 01:14:26,078
clear the room. Do it.

590
01:14:26,246 --> 01:14:27,955
-He's going for the oil.
-Of course.

591
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:30,374
The one pipeline the West is counting on

592
01:14:30,459 --> 01:14:33,586
to supply our reserves
for the next century.

593
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:36,255
-Do you have an idea?
-Maybe.

594
01:14:37,257 --> 01:14:40,343
How far is that rig from the terminal?
And how fast is it traveling?

595
01:14:40,927 --> 01:14:45,348
It's 106 miles from the terminal,
going 70 miles an hour.

596
01:14:45,599 --> 01:14:47,683
We've got 78 minutes.
Do you have another rig?

597
01:14:47,768 --> 01:14:50,478
There's one parked in the passageway
ahead of it.

598
01:14:50,771 --> 01:14:53,481
-Charles, can you get me out there?
-Of course.

599
01:14:54,608 --> 01:14:55,691
Wait a minute.

600
01:14:55,776 --> 01:14:57,485
Are you gonna do
what I think you're gonna do?

601
01:14:57,569 --> 01:15:00,780
-What do I need to defuse a nuclear bomb?
-Me.

602
01:15:13,460 --> 01:15:16,337
There it is. Hatch to the passageway.

603
01:15:21,218 --> 01:15:22,259
Take the controls.

604
01:15:22,344 --> 01:15:24,512
You keep the speed up
so the other rig catches up with us.

605
01:15:24,596 --> 01:15:26,806
-I'll be waiting to hear from you.
-Gotcha.

606
01:15:27,516 --> 01:15:29,141
You know how to drive
one of these things?

607
01:15:29,309 --> 01:15:32,436
Doesn't exactly take a degree
in nuclear physics.

608
01:15:40,821 --> 01:15:43,906
They're in the pipeline.
They're on the move.

609
01:16:00,674 --> 01:16:01,841
Faster!

610
01:16:09,724 --> 01:16:12,685
If there's even the slightest chance,
Bond will succeed.

611
01:16:12,853 --> 01:16:16,564
He's the best we have,
though I'd never tell him.

612
01:16:18,108 --> 01:16:19,608
I hope you're right.

613
01:16:23,321 --> 01:16:24,655
Here it comes!

614
01:16:28,952 --> 01:16:31,120
It's closing up. Faster!

615
01:16:36,710 --> 01:16:38,210
Sit tight.

616
01:16:53,727 --> 01:16:55,728
No brakes! The controls are jammed!

617
01:17:10,202 --> 01:17:14,079
It's a tactical fission device, low yield.
Hold me steady.

618
01:17:14,998 --> 01:17:16,957
You've defused hundreds of these, right?

619
01:17:17,167 --> 01:17:19,418
Yeah, but they're usually standing still.

620
01:17:19,503 --> 01:17:22,463
Yeah, well, life's full of small challenges.

621
01:17:24,549 --> 01:17:27,718
Have a look at this.
Someone stripped the screw heads.

622
01:17:29,262 --> 01:17:31,055
Someone's tampered with the bomb.

623
01:17:51,451 --> 01:17:54,119
Look, half the plutonium's missing.

624
01:17:54,996 --> 01:17:57,665
So what are you saying?
It couldn't go nuclear?

625
01:17:57,749 --> 01:18:00,334
There's still enough explosive in there
to kill both of us

626
01:18:00,418 --> 01:18:01,919
if the trigger charge goes off.

627
01:18:02,003 --> 01:18:03,837
-Let it blow.
-But I can stop it.

628
01:18:03,922 --> 01:18:04,964
Let it blow!

629
01:18:11,137 --> 01:18:12,429
Trust me! Leave it!

630
01:18:16,393 --> 01:18:18,143
Move down. Move down!

631
01:18:18,353 --> 01:18:19,812
Jump! Go on, jump!

632
01:18:22,816 --> 01:18:23,983
Jump!

633
01:18:38,498 --> 01:18:40,165
Robinson's reporting.

634
01:18:40,667 --> 01:18:42,668
The bomb was a dud.

635
01:18:43,670 --> 01:18:47,089
But the triggering charge blew out
a 50-yard section of the pipe.

636
01:18:47,299 --> 01:18:48,382
And Bond?

637
01:18:49,467 --> 01:18:50,467
Nothing.

638
01:18:52,304 --> 01:18:53,846
I'm so sorry.

639
01:18:56,725 --> 01:18:58,475
But I have a gift for you.

640
01:18:59,269 --> 01:19:03,731
Something that belonged to my father.
He would've wanted you to have it.

641
01:19:04,858 --> 01:19:08,110
-Perhaps this isn't the time.
-Please.

642
01:19:09,613 --> 01:19:13,699
He often spoke of how compassionately
you advised him

643
01:19:13,783 --> 01:19:17,077
on the best course of action
during my kidnapping.

644
01:19:21,041 --> 01:19:22,708
It's very valuable, you know.

645
01:19:23,543 --> 01:19:26,378
I just couldn't let it explode
with the rest of him.

646
01:19:31,426 --> 01:19:34,637
I was very upset when the money
didn't kill both of you.

647
01:19:35,430 --> 01:19:37,765
I didn't think I'd get another chance.

648
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:41,852
Then you dropped the answer
right in my lap.

649
01:19:42,354 --> 01:19:46,815
Bond. And as you say,
he's the best you have.

650
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:48,901
Or should I say, "had"?

651
01:19:55,408 --> 01:19:56,950
Take her to the helicopter.

652
01:20:03,833 --> 01:20:06,210
Come on, give me your hand.
Jump, jump, jump!

653
01:20:08,046 --> 01:20:09,963
Do you wanna explain why you did that?

654
01:20:10,090 --> 01:20:12,591
I could've stopped that bomb.
You almost killed us.

655
01:20:12,926 --> 01:20:14,301
I did kill us.

656
01:20:14,928 --> 01:20:18,263
She thinks we're dead,
and she thinks she got away with it.

657
01:20:18,431 --> 01:20:21,892
Do you wanna put that in English for
those of us who don't speak "spy"?

658
01:20:22,102 --> 01:20:24,561
-Who's "she"?
-Elektra King.

659
01:20:24,771 --> 01:20:27,022
Well, why would she blow up
her own pipeline?

660
01:20:27,107 --> 01:20:28,607
It makes her look innocent.

661
01:20:30,443 --> 01:20:33,028
The explosion covers up
the theft of the plutonium.

662
01:20:34,948 --> 01:20:36,699
And they make it look
like a terrorist attack.

663
01:20:36,783 --> 01:20:39,034
But why leave this half?

664
01:20:39,411 --> 01:20:43,038
So there's enough to spread around
to cover up for the part that they did take.

665
01:20:43,164 --> 01:20:45,207
But what are they gonna do
with the other half?

666
01:20:45,458 --> 01:20:47,918
It's not enough to make a nuclear bomb.

667
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:50,879
-You're the scientist, you tell me.
-I don't know.

668
01:20:52,006 --> 01:20:54,633
But the world's greatest terrorist
running around with six kilos

669
01:20:54,718 --> 01:20:57,010
of weapons-grade plutonium
can't be good.

670
01:20:57,303 --> 01:20:59,805
I have to get it back,
or somebody's gonna have my ass.

671
01:21:02,642 --> 01:21:04,017
First things first.

672
01:21:06,271 --> 01:21:08,188
Bond to Robinson. Do you copy?

673
01:21:08,356 --> 01:21:12,693
By the way, before we go any further,
I just wanna know,

674
01:21:13,987 --> 01:21:19,283
-what's the story with you and Elektra?
-We're strictly platonic. Now.

675
01:21:19,492 --> 01:21:21,368
Bond to Robinson. Copy?

676
01:21:24,038 --> 01:21:28,083
What's your story?
What are you doing here in Kazakhstan?

677
01:21:28,376 --> 01:21:31,462
Avoiding those kind of questions,
just like you.

678
01:21:32,005 --> 01:21:34,590
I read you, 007. Red alert.

679
01:21:34,799 --> 01:21:36,925
M is missing with Elektra.
Three men down.

680
01:21:37,135 --> 01:21:39,011
Await instructions. Out.

681
01:21:40,555 --> 01:21:41,555
What do we do now?

682
01:21:46,186 --> 01:21:48,562
There's one critical element here
I may have overlooked.

683
01:21:48,813 --> 01:21:50,731
-What? More plutonium?
-No.

684
01:21:51,524 --> 01:21:53,317
Beluga.

685
01:21:53,401 --> 01:21:54,651
Caviar.

686
01:22:24,432 --> 01:22:25,808
Brought me something?

687
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:34,233
The power to reshape the world.

688
01:22:37,654 --> 01:22:40,531
Go on. It's safe.

689
01:22:41,866 --> 01:22:43,116
Touch your destiny.

690
01:22:57,131 --> 01:22:59,716
I have brought something for you, as well.

691
01:23:06,182 --> 01:23:10,519
Your present,
courtesy of the late Mr. Bond.

692
01:23:11,479 --> 01:23:14,606
-My executioner.
-Overpraise, I'm afraid.

693
01:23:15,483 --> 01:23:18,402
-But my people will finish the job.
-Your people?

694
01:23:18,945 --> 01:23:24,283
Your people will leave you here to rot
just like you left me.

695
01:23:25,285 --> 01:23:26,577
You and my father.

696
01:23:26,786 --> 01:23:28,829
-Your father wasn't...
-My father was nothing.

697
01:23:29,455 --> 01:23:31,957
His kingdom, he stole from my mother.

698
01:23:33,042 --> 01:23:35,794
The kingdom I will rightly take back.

699
01:23:44,762 --> 01:23:47,222
I hope you're proud
of what you did to her.

700
01:23:48,558 --> 01:23:51,018
I'm afraid it is you who deserve credit.

701
01:23:52,604 --> 01:23:56,356
When I took her, she was promise itself,

702
01:23:57,317 --> 01:23:59,902
and you left her at the mercy
of a man like me.

703
01:24:01,070 --> 01:24:02,696
You ruined her.

704
01:24:03,406 --> 01:24:05,741
For what? To get to me?

705
01:24:06,659 --> 01:24:09,661
-She's worth 50 of me.
-For once, I agree with you.

706
01:24:11,998 --> 01:24:16,335
Yes. And now we also share
a common fate.

707
01:24:17,503 --> 01:24:20,797
You will die,
along with everyone in this city

708
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:26,845
and the bright, starry, oil-driven
future of the West.

709
01:24:33,353 --> 01:24:38,273
Since you sent your man to kill me,
I've been watching time tick slowly away,

710
01:24:39,359 --> 01:24:41,151
marching toward my own death.

711
01:24:45,114 --> 01:24:47,032
Now you can have the same pleasure.

712
01:24:51,412 --> 01:24:53,163
Watch these hands, M.

713
01:24:54,207 --> 01:24:57,876
By noon tomorrow, your time is up.

714
01:24:59,462 --> 01:25:03,048
And I guarantee you, I will not miss.

715
01:25:25,989 --> 01:25:27,531
So beautiful.

716
01:25:29,117 --> 01:25:30,534
So smooth.

717
01:25:31,911 --> 01:25:33,370
So warm.

718
01:25:34,288 --> 01:25:35,872
How would you know?

719
01:25:41,212 --> 01:25:45,424
Why are you like this?
Because Bond is dead?

720
01:25:47,093 --> 01:25:51,346
-It's what you wanted.
-Of course it's what I wanted.

721
01:25:56,936 --> 01:25:58,103
He was...

722
01:26:01,399 --> 01:26:02,691
He was a good lover?

723
01:26:03,568 --> 01:26:06,611
What do you think?
I wouldn't feel anything?

724
01:26:21,794 --> 01:26:23,295
I feel nothing.

725
01:26:39,312 --> 01:26:40,645
What about this?

726
01:26:51,824 --> 01:26:57,120
But surely, you can feel this?

727
01:27:04,337 --> 01:27:09,466
Remember pleasure?

728
01:27:57,140 --> 01:27:58,223
Wait here.

729
01:27:59,225 --> 01:28:03,395
Always something.
First the casino, now the caviar factory.

730
01:28:04,063 --> 01:28:06,690
I am a slave to the free-market economy.

731
01:28:20,204 --> 01:28:21,204
Hello?

732
01:28:23,374 --> 01:28:24,875
Bond is alive.

733
01:28:30,089 --> 01:28:32,382
Is nothing in this place straight?

734
01:28:37,430 --> 01:28:40,640
Who are you? And how did you get in?

735
01:28:41,267 --> 01:28:44,895
I'll call security and congratulate them.

736
01:28:45,813 --> 01:28:47,105
Drink?

737
01:28:50,109 --> 01:28:52,694
Can't you just say hello
like a normal person?

738
01:28:54,363 --> 01:28:55,697
Get lost.

739
01:28:56,449 --> 01:28:59,075
No, no, no. Down the back.

740
01:29:01,454 --> 01:29:03,121
What's your business with Elektra King?

741
01:29:04,123 --> 01:29:07,584
I thought you were the one
giving her the business.

742
01:29:07,668 --> 01:29:11,087
She drops $1 million in your casino,
and you don't even blink an eye.

743
01:29:11,297 --> 01:29:13,131
What's she paying you off for?

744
01:29:14,300 --> 01:29:17,802
You know, if I were you,
a relationship with a man like that,

745
01:29:17,929 --> 01:29:19,179
I wouldn't bet on it.

746
01:29:23,643 --> 01:29:25,894
$5000 of beluga ruined.

747
01:29:25,978 --> 01:29:29,105
That's nothing compared to what a
20-megaton nuclear bomb can do.

748
01:29:29,190 --> 01:29:30,232
What are you talking about?

749
01:29:30,316 --> 01:29:32,484
We had a nuclear bomb
stolen this morning.

750
01:29:32,568 --> 01:29:34,903
Renard and Elektra King
are working together.

751
01:29:35,029 --> 01:29:36,780
-I didn't know.
-Well, what do you know?

752
01:32:00,966 --> 01:32:02,592
Q's not gonna like this.

753
01:33:20,171 --> 01:33:22,046
Hide!

754
01:33:32,850 --> 01:33:33,933
Get out!

755
01:34:45,548 --> 01:34:46,589
Help!

756
01:34:46,674 --> 01:34:49,050
Now, where were we?

757
01:34:49,134 --> 01:34:51,928
-A rope, please!
-No. The truth.

758
01:34:52,012 --> 01:34:53,096
She has M.

759
01:34:53,180 --> 01:34:55,974
-I know nothing about that.
-Those blades were meant for you.

760
01:34:56,058 --> 01:34:58,434
What does Elektra King
want you dead for?

761
01:34:59,186 --> 01:35:03,565
It was you who destroyed my factory,
then you drown my Rolls-Royce,

762
01:35:03,649 --> 01:35:07,151
and now you're trying to drown me
in my own caviar!

763
01:35:07,486 --> 01:35:08,861
Let me out!

764
01:35:09,321 --> 01:35:12,198
Too bad we don't have any champagne.

765
01:35:12,283 --> 01:35:13,533
Or sour cream.

766
01:35:14,076 --> 01:35:15,076
Okay, okay.

767
01:35:16,870 --> 01:35:22,875
Occasionally, I get equipment for her.
Machinery. You know, Russian stuff.

768
01:35:23,002 --> 01:35:24,711
And the payoff in the casino?

769
01:35:25,212 --> 01:35:26,462
It was a special job.

770
01:35:27,256 --> 01:35:29,007
My nephew is in the navy.

771
01:35:30,384 --> 01:35:33,595
He's smuggling some machinery for her.

772
01:35:33,804 --> 01:35:35,513
-Where?
-Absolutely not!

773
01:35:35,598 --> 01:35:36,639
Where?

774
01:35:40,227 --> 01:35:42,812
-Where?
-Istanbul!

775
01:35:52,197 --> 01:35:55,575
You! Where have you been,
you gold-encrusted buffoon?

776
01:35:55,659 --> 01:35:58,369
Sorry, boss. I must have bumped my head.

777
01:35:58,537 --> 01:36:00,163
Oh, really? Get me out of here,

778
01:36:00,247 --> 01:36:02,624
I'll show you
what a bumped head feels like.

779
01:36:02,708 --> 01:36:06,961
Look. We have no roof,
but at least we have four good walls.

780
01:36:19,558 --> 01:36:23,519
The insurance company
is never going to believe this.

781
01:37:24,873 --> 01:37:27,959
This used to be
the KGB's Istanbul safe house.

782
01:37:28,043 --> 01:37:31,212
Now it's FSB. Federal Security Bureau.

783
01:37:31,422 --> 01:37:34,090
Same old friendly service
with a new name.

784
01:37:34,508 --> 01:37:36,551
-Did you raise Nikoli?
-Nothing.

785
01:37:36,635 --> 01:37:39,178
Try scanning the emergency frequencies.

786
01:37:40,931 --> 01:37:41,973
Tragedy.

787
01:37:42,433 --> 01:37:45,393
In the old days,
there were at least a hundred places

788
01:37:45,477 --> 01:37:47,562
where a submarine
could surface undetected.

789
01:37:47,646 --> 01:37:48,730
Submarine?

790
01:37:49,481 --> 01:37:51,441
What class is your nephew running?

791
01:37:53,444 --> 01:37:55,403
-Victor III, you call it.
-Nuclear.

792
01:37:55,487 --> 01:37:58,281
He's not loading cargo. They want the sub.
They want to use the reactor.

793
01:37:58,365 --> 01:37:59,407
That's it.

794
01:37:59,491 --> 01:38:02,410
Put weapons-grade plutonium
in that sub's reactor,

795
01:38:02,536 --> 01:38:04,912
instant catastrophic meltdown.

796
01:38:05,122 --> 01:38:07,165
Making it all look just like an accident.

797
01:38:08,125 --> 01:38:09,333
But why?

798
01:38:10,002 --> 01:38:15,506
Because the existing pipelines from
the Caspian Sea go to the north. Here.

799
01:38:16,008 --> 01:38:20,178
The oil is put onboard the tankers, shipped
across the Black Sea, down to Istanbul.

800
01:38:20,929 --> 01:38:26,184
The explosion would destroy Istanbul,
contaminating the Bosporus for decades.

801
01:38:27,352 --> 01:38:29,479
And there'd be only one way
to get the oil out.

802
01:38:29,688 --> 01:38:33,399
Yeah, down south to the Med.
The King pipeline.

803
01:38:33,817 --> 01:38:34,901
Elektra's pipeline.

804
01:38:35,402 --> 01:38:37,195
We must find Nikoli.

805
01:38:39,156 --> 01:38:40,531
Captain Nikoli?

806
01:38:42,659 --> 01:38:43,743
Sir.

807
01:38:44,661 --> 01:38:46,204
Ready to load your cargo.

808
01:38:46,413 --> 01:38:48,331
We have only a few hours
before we'll be missed.

809
01:38:48,415 --> 01:38:49,457
You came with a skeleton crew?

810
01:38:49,541 --> 01:38:51,542
-Yeah, that's all we can afford these days.
-Of course.

811
01:38:52,211 --> 01:38:54,545
Some brandy and refreshments
for your men.

812
01:38:56,548 --> 01:38:57,632
Thank you.

813
01:39:02,888 --> 01:39:04,055
Good morning.

814
01:39:08,685 --> 01:39:10,019
What's the time?

815
01:39:23,617 --> 01:39:25,576
It's time for you to die.

816
01:39:58,193 --> 01:39:59,610
I've got something

817
01:40:00,571 --> 01:40:02,321
on the emergency frequency.

818
01:40:02,531 --> 01:40:05,116
Two six-digit numbers cycled
every 15 seconds.

819
01:40:05,284 --> 01:40:09,245
-A GPS signal. Position coordinates.
-Locator card. M.

820
01:40:12,624 --> 01:40:14,542
-Here.
-Yeah. Maiden's Tower.

821
01:40:14,626 --> 01:40:17,295
-Have you been there?
-No. No. Mr. Bullion.

822
01:40:21,466 --> 01:40:22,592
Bomb!

823
01:40:29,474 --> 01:40:30,892
Come on, come on, come on.

824
01:40:44,656 --> 01:40:47,950
After you. I insist.

825
01:41:05,010 --> 01:41:06,928
Enjoyed your meal, boys?

826
01:41:14,811 --> 01:41:16,938
Take them up and throw them in the sea.

827
01:41:29,284 --> 01:41:30,868
The extruder's in here.

828
01:41:32,329 --> 01:41:36,290
It will take me half an hour to set up
the machine to make the plutonium rod.

829
01:41:43,131 --> 01:41:44,548
Put them in here.

830
01:41:54,101 --> 01:41:57,728
The reactor is secured.
Everything is complete as planned.

831
01:42:00,482 --> 01:42:04,235
-Is your helicopter ready?
-It's going to pick me up in half an hour.

832
01:42:07,739 --> 01:42:09,281
Then this is the end.

833
01:42:09,533 --> 01:42:12,326
No. This is the beginning.

834
01:42:13,954 --> 01:42:15,746
The world will never be the same.

835
01:42:29,428 --> 01:42:33,639
The future is yours. Have fun with it.

836
01:42:41,106 --> 01:42:42,523
James Bond.

837
01:42:51,033 --> 01:42:52,366
If only you'd kept away,

838
01:42:52,451 --> 01:42:55,870
we might have met again in a few years
and become lovers once more.

839
01:43:05,464 --> 01:43:06,964
Take her to Renard.

840
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:13,137
Pretty thing. You had her, too?

841
01:43:18,435 --> 01:43:20,311
I could've given you the world.

842
01:43:21,772 --> 01:43:23,355
The world is not enough.

843
01:43:24,274 --> 01:43:27,318
-Foolish sentiment.
-Family motto.

844
01:43:30,614 --> 01:43:34,992
They were digging near here,
and they found some very pretty vases.

845
01:43:36,203 --> 01:43:38,370
They also found this chair.

846
01:43:49,049 --> 01:43:53,135
I think we ignore the old ways
at our peril, don't you?

847
01:43:54,137 --> 01:43:57,723
-Where's M?
-Soon, she'll be everywhere.

848
01:43:59,351 --> 01:44:03,854
All this because you fell for Renard?

849
01:44:07,150 --> 01:44:10,111
Five more turns and your neck will break.

850
01:44:13,573 --> 01:44:16,075
I've always had a power over men.

851
01:44:18,286 --> 01:44:22,623
When I realized my father wouldn't
rescue me from the kidnappers,

852
01:44:23,041 --> 01:44:25,709
I knew I had to form another alliance.

853
01:44:27,087 --> 01:44:30,548
You turned Renard.

854
01:44:32,092 --> 01:44:36,846
Just like you, only you were even easier.

855
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:44,562
I told him he had to hurt me.
He had to make it look real.

856
01:44:45,856 --> 01:44:51,152
When he refused,
I told him I would do it myself.

857
01:44:55,615 --> 01:44:58,826
So you killed your father.

858
01:44:59,995 --> 01:45:01,245
He killed me.

859
01:45:02,956 --> 01:45:05,291
He killed me the day
he refused to pay my ransom.

860
01:45:05,584 --> 01:45:07,877
Was this all about the oil?

861
01:45:09,629 --> 01:45:11,422
It is my oil.

862
01:45:12,215 --> 01:45:14,758
Mine and my family's.

863
01:45:15,093 --> 01:45:18,262
It runs in my veins, thicker than blood.

864
01:45:19,431 --> 01:45:21,807
I'm going to redraw the map.

865
01:45:22,058 --> 01:45:25,352
And when I'm through,
the whole world will know my name,

866
01:45:25,562 --> 01:45:28,772
my grandfather's name,
the glory of my people!

867
01:45:28,857 --> 01:45:32,067
No one will believe this meltdown
was an accident.

868
01:45:32,569 --> 01:45:35,029
They will believe. They will all believe.

869
01:45:36,072 --> 01:45:39,700
You understand? Nobody can resist me.

870
01:45:44,664 --> 01:45:47,708
You know what happens
when a man is strangled?

871
01:45:47,792 --> 01:45:51,170
Elektra, it's not too late.

872
01:45:53,173 --> 01:45:55,966
Eight million people need not die.

873
01:45:57,802 --> 01:46:00,471
You should've killed me
when you had the chance.

874
01:46:01,598 --> 01:46:04,767
But you couldn't. Not me.
Not a woman you've loved.

875
01:46:15,195 --> 01:46:17,696
You meant nothing to me.

876
01:46:23,161 --> 01:46:29,208
One last screw.

877
01:46:29,334 --> 01:46:31,001
Oh, James.

878
01:46:54,359 --> 01:46:58,862
Boss, you're alive. So glad to see you.

879
01:46:59,656 --> 01:47:00,781
Me too.

880
01:47:06,830 --> 01:47:08,414
I'm looking for a submarine.

881
01:47:08,498 --> 01:47:11,709
It's big and black, and the driver
is a very good friend of mine.

882
01:47:16,756 --> 01:47:18,716
Bring it to me.

883
01:47:20,010 --> 01:47:22,886
What a shame. He's just gone.

884
01:48:11,061 --> 01:48:13,145
Zukovsky really hated you.

885
01:48:14,898 --> 01:48:17,608
Everything's under control up here.
Are you ready?

886
01:48:24,741 --> 01:48:26,367
Time to say good night.

887
01:48:55,230 --> 01:48:58,899
James, you can't kill me,
not in cold blood.

888
01:49:05,698 --> 01:49:06,990
Bond!

889
01:49:28,513 --> 01:49:29,680
Call him off.

890
01:49:36,813 --> 01:49:38,355
I won't ask again.

891
01:49:39,691 --> 01:49:43,360
Call him off. Call him off!

892
01:49:48,074 --> 01:49:49,324
Renard.

893
01:49:54,122 --> 01:49:57,416
You wouldn't kill me. You'd miss me.

894
01:49:59,878 --> 01:50:00,878
Yes.

895
01:50:01,921 --> 01:50:03,839
Dive! Bond...

896
01:50:09,429 --> 01:50:10,762
I never miss.

897
01:51:18,998 --> 01:51:20,290
Where is she?

898
01:51:38,309 --> 01:51:39,309
James!

899
01:51:40,061 --> 01:51:42,271
Thought I'd forgotten you, eh?

900
01:52:14,512 --> 01:52:17,889
Level at 100 feet. Hold her steady.

901
01:52:28,693 --> 01:52:30,068
Level at 100 feet.

902
01:52:35,533 --> 01:52:39,995
If we can force them up to the surface,
they'll show up on the spy satellite,

903
01:52:40,371 --> 01:52:41,872
bring out the navy.

904
01:52:52,258 --> 01:52:53,717
Come on. Get up!

905
01:52:53,885 --> 01:52:55,594
Over there. Go! Move!

906
01:52:55,678 --> 01:52:56,887
Move! Go, go, go!

907
01:52:57,055 --> 01:53:00,515
Get over there! Stay! Up!

908
01:53:30,755 --> 01:53:33,215
Get us level! Level!

909
01:53:33,424 --> 01:53:35,050
It's all smashed!

910
01:53:35,259 --> 01:53:36,301
Christmas?

911
01:53:37,762 --> 01:53:41,515
-So we're going up, then?
-Slight miscalculation.

912
01:53:53,611 --> 01:53:54,695
Hold on!

913
01:53:56,823 --> 01:53:58,782
Hold on, hold on.

914
01:54:14,090 --> 01:54:15,465
Brace yourself.

915
01:54:44,746 --> 01:54:47,914
-It's flooding!
-Get up to the hatch.

916
01:54:55,882 --> 01:54:59,926
Damn! Come on! Go, go!

917
01:55:00,678 --> 01:55:03,847
Move! Go on! Get out, now!

918
01:55:24,744 --> 01:55:27,204
He's opened up the reactor!

919
01:55:27,288 --> 01:55:28,830
And locked himself in!

920
01:55:28,915 --> 01:55:30,791
I have to get up there to him.

921
01:55:31,542 --> 01:55:32,918
We've got one chance.

922
01:55:33,002 --> 01:55:37,589
I'll get out of the submarine and back in
through the reactor room escape hatch.

923
01:55:41,093 --> 01:55:45,055
When the light goes red,
press this button so I can get back in.

924
01:55:45,723 --> 01:55:47,307
James, it's too risky.

925
01:55:47,391 --> 01:55:50,227
If I don't make it,
use this chamber to get out.

926
01:55:50,311 --> 01:55:51,520
Close the hatch.

927
01:55:51,604 --> 01:55:53,855
Be sure to exhale all the way up. Close it.

928
01:58:23,172 --> 01:58:24,172
James!

929
01:58:26,550 --> 01:58:27,550
Help!

930
01:58:38,729 --> 01:58:39,980
Come on, come on!

931
01:58:43,192 --> 01:58:45,276
We're safe from the radiation

932
01:58:45,361 --> 01:58:48,196
as long as the reactor coolant
doesn't burst.

933
01:58:48,280 --> 01:58:50,991
If he had gotten the plutonium rod
in the reactor,

934
01:58:51,200 --> 01:58:53,576
we could've written off the whole city.

935
01:58:53,828 --> 01:58:54,828
James!

936
01:58:57,790 --> 01:58:59,749
Welcome to my nuclear family.

937
01:59:26,318 --> 01:59:28,737
Are you really gonna
commit suicide for her?

938
01:59:28,821 --> 01:59:31,281
You forget, I'm already dead.

939
01:59:31,657 --> 01:59:34,993
Haven't you heard? So is she.

940
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:41,416
You're lying.

941
01:59:44,795 --> 01:59:45,962
Liar!

942
02:01:08,003 --> 02:01:09,379
She's waiting for you.

943
02:01:27,648 --> 02:01:32,652
The hydrogen gas level's too high.
One spark and the reactor will blow.

944
02:01:32,862 --> 02:01:34,445
I have to stop it.

945
02:01:38,117 --> 02:01:41,286
Go to the top of the submarine.
I'll meet you in the torpedo bay. Go!

946
02:01:47,168 --> 02:01:48,710
The reactor is flooded.

947
02:01:50,504 --> 02:01:53,173
So it's safe even if this place blows.

948
02:02:25,581 --> 02:02:26,581
Hey!

949
02:02:29,668 --> 02:02:30,668
Hey!

950
02:02:31,212 --> 02:02:33,338
-Hi!
-Hello!

951
02:02:37,384 --> 02:02:42,138
No, it's simply not the case.
No. Before that.

952
02:02:47,519 --> 02:02:50,230
-Any word?
-No. Still no contact.

953
02:02:55,319 --> 02:02:57,695
Always wanted to have Christmas
in Turkey.

954
02:03:00,241 --> 02:03:05,286
-Was that a Christmas joke?
-From me? No. Never.

955
02:03:06,330 --> 02:03:08,748
So isn't it time
you unwrapped your present?

956
02:03:08,832 --> 02:03:10,291
Oh, I think so.

957
02:03:15,130 --> 02:03:16,673
Look. What's that?

958
02:03:17,591 --> 02:03:19,217
-The card.
-So he must be nearby.

959
02:03:19,510 --> 02:03:20,593
Where?

960
02:03:23,681 --> 02:03:25,431
-Where?
-It picks up body heat,

961
02:03:25,516 --> 02:03:27,308
so humans come out orange.

962
02:03:29,603 --> 02:03:30,645
There.

963
02:03:33,774 --> 02:03:35,650
I thought you said he was with Dr. Jones?

964
02:03:41,365 --> 02:03:42,365
It's getting redder.

965
02:03:49,957 --> 02:03:51,165
007!

966
02:03:56,547 --> 02:03:59,674
Must be a premature form
of the millennium bug.

967
02:04:02,553 --> 02:04:04,095
I was wrong about you.

968
02:04:05,389 --> 02:04:07,140
Yeah? How so?

969
02:04:09,101 --> 02:04:12,101
I thought Christmas only comes
once a year.
