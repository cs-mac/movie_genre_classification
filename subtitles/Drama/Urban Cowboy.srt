1
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:25,026
Bud! Your breakfast's gettin' cold.

2
00:00:25,151 --> 00:00:29,196
-I don't want it, Mamma. I gotta go.
-All right.

3
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:45,504
-Morning.
-Sit down and eat your breakfast.

4
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,923
-No, I'll just have coffee.
-I made gravy.

5
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:51,010
-I made biscuits.
-Looks good, but I wanna get goin'.

6
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:53,179
All right.

7
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:55,973
Y'all gonna miss me?

8
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:02,688
Here's some chicken to eat on the road.
And field peas for your Aunt Corene.

9
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:06,817
You just can't get good vegetables
in Houston now. You'll see.

10
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:09,570
Good luck, son. You take care.

11
00:01:09,695 --> 00:01:13,783
Be careful, you hear?
And don't drive too fast.

12
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:16,619
-Call me the minute you get there.
-I will.

13
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:24,085
So long, boy.

14
00:01:30,216 --> 00:01:32,259
See you later, Bud!

15
00:04:07,707 --> 00:04:09,750
Hi, Bud!

16
00:04:14,005 --> 00:04:16,090
Is that you, Lou Sue? Gimme a hug.

17
00:04:16,215 --> 00:04:18,217
Bob! Bud's here!

18
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:20,386
Hey, Willie!

19
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:25,599
-Bud, how are you doin'?
-Hey, your new house is real nice.

20
00:04:25,725 --> 00:04:28,978
Wait till you see the inside.
How's everybody in Spur?

21
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:32,648
-I got you!
-You got me.

22
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,984
You're too good!

23
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:38,070
There you go, darlin'.
I want you to eat some of that.

24
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,448
No? Honestly!

25
00:04:40,573 --> 00:04:45,953
<i>-I hope you're OK sleeping with Willie.
-I hope he's OK sleeping with me.</i>

26
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:49,165
-I'll get my own place soon as I can.
-Don't worry about it.

27
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:54,253
-You can stay as long as you want.
-I appreciate it.

28
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:58,507
-How about some more pie?
-No. I can't eat no more. I can't.

29
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,135
-Come on. One piece.
-You want me as fat as him?

30
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,304
What's wrong with that?

31
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:07,391
-Where are you boys goin' tonight?
-To Gilley's.

32
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:16,984
Goddamn! The place
hasn't changed a bit.

33
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:20,571
Just keep walking. If they go
to shootin', drop to the ground.

34
00:05:20,696 --> 00:05:22,740
Bud, come on!

35
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,786
If y'all goin' out there to watch,
you have to pay to get back in!

36
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,580
Hell of a fight goin' on out there.

37
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:31,791
How much do we owe you?

38
00:05:31,916 --> 00:05:35,252
-There's three of us.
-Holy shit!

39
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:51,394
-This is bigger than my home town.
-The biggest honky-tonk in the world.

40
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,147
Leo! How great to see you!
How are you?

41
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:07,326
Hey, Bud. There's three and a half acres
of concrete prairie in here.

42
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:18,504
They've had 7,000 people
in here at one time.

43
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,423
-That right?
-Yeah.

44
00:06:20,548 --> 00:06:23,384
I don't know how many
they've got in here now.

45
00:06:26,554 --> 00:06:30,725
Pretty good crowd, though.
Let's get to the bar and get us a drink.

46
00:06:33,144 --> 00:06:35,354
-Hey, Marshall!
-Bob, how are you?

47
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:43,612
I want y'all to meet my nephew.
This is Bud. He just got in from Spur.

48
00:06:43,738 --> 00:06:47,241
This is Marshall. Wayne. These boys
work with me at Channel Oil.

49
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:50,119
-We're gonna take off.
-OK. Talk to you later.

50
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:51,871
Give us a couple of beers.

51
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:08,804
Thank you, everybody, and welcome
to Gilley's. Good to have y'all with us.

52
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:32,244
That's Mickey Gilley himself. He owns
this place with Sherwood Cryer.

53
00:07:39,085 --> 00:07:42,463
Hey, Steve! Come here.
I want you to meet somebody.

54
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:47,009
How you doin'?
This is my nephew Bud, from Spur.

55
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,553
Steve. Steve Strange.

56
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:54,517
Steve and I ran the rodeo circuit
together. He works for Gilley's now.

57
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:56,852
Hi, Bud. It's nice to meet you.

58
00:07:56,977 --> 00:08:01,941
Hey, Steve, this is Bud's first night
in town. Take care of him, will you?

59
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:08,280
Hey, girls! Come on over here.
I got somebody I want you to meet.

60
00:08:08,406 --> 00:08:13,411
-Say hi to Bob, Corene and Bud.
-Come on, darlin', let's dance.

61
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:19,333
Where've you been?
We haven't seen you around here.

62
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,293
I'm from Spur.

63
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,760
-Good morning.
-Morning.

64
00:08:37,143 --> 00:08:39,103
Shit.

65
00:08:39,228 --> 00:08:42,440
I'm gonna make you
a nice cup of coffee, darlin'.

66
00:08:42,565 --> 00:08:44,608
That sounds good.

67
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:05,296
No, Ethel, you can't talk
to your little boy just now.

68
00:09:05,421 --> 00:09:07,465
Because he ain't home.

69
00:09:08,591 --> 00:09:10,760
Must still be at church.

70
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:17,683
Hold on just a minute.

71
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:19,852
Is that you, Bud?

72
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:27,443
Get out the Alka-Seltzer.

73
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:31,030
Bud, your mamma's on the phone.

74
00:09:37,244 --> 00:09:39,288
I told her you went to church.

75
00:09:41,374 --> 00:09:43,167
Hi, Mamma.

76
00:09:46,337 --> 00:09:49,715
No, I don't have no job yet.
I just got here yesterday.

77
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,723
I'm goin' to the plant tomorrow
with Uncle Bob.

78
00:09:58,724 --> 00:09:59,809
Fine. I'll tell you.

79
00:10:04,063 --> 00:10:05,981
Bud Davis?

80
00:10:06,107 --> 00:10:09,193
My real name is Buford Uan Davis.

81
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:14,198
But they don't call me Buford no more,
except my grandma on my dad's side.

82
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:17,451
She still calls me Buford,
but she's half-Indian.

83
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,791
They call me Bud cos my initials
are B-U-D. Buford Uan Davis.

84
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:26,168
-It spells "Bud".
-I can spell, boy.

85
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:34,218
Which pipeline? There ain't one in Spur.

86
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:38,222
Yes, there is. Came in this spring.
I was workin' on the insulating.

87
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:42,810
Uncle Bob told me you was hiring,
so I thought I'd come and check it out.

88
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:51,527
Most of our insulating we contract out.
But I can start you as a general helper.

89
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:54,655
A flunky, a gofer.
You know what a gofer is, boy?

90
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:58,117
I think it means, you know,
"go for" things.

91
00:10:59,452 --> 00:11:02,288
Or it could mean you're an animal.

92
00:11:03,289 --> 00:11:08,586
Around here they're on the same level.
Start you at the bottom. You work up.

93
00:11:08,711 --> 00:11:12,840
I wanna tell you one thing. You're gettin'
this job because of your Uncle Bob.

94
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:16,135
He's been here a long time
and he's a damn good man.

95
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:20,556
I'll tell you one thing more.
You're gonna have to lose that beard.

96
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:24,101
It's regulation if you have to wear
any kind of a fresh-air mask.

97
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,484
-Got everything you need?
-Yep.

98
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:36,030
-Corene sure is gonna be happy.
-Well, I'm gonna do it.

99
00:11:36,155 --> 00:11:38,908
Just gotta go for it, can't hold off.

100
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:41,118
I better get on back to work.

101
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:44,955
-All right. I'll see you later.
-Yeah, I'll see you later.

102
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:54,507
Here goes.

103
00:12:56,861 --> 00:12:58,029
See you later.

104
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,633
Hey, Bud!

105
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:22,511
-How are you doing?
-Fine.

106
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:25,222
-Anything I can do for you?
-Not yet.

107
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:30,186
Are you a real cowboy?

108
00:13:31,645 --> 00:13:34,482
That depends on what
you think a real cowboy is.

109
00:13:35,024 --> 00:13:38,110
-The other night you had a beard?
-That's right.

110
00:13:39,653 --> 00:13:42,198
It looked good.
You shouldn't have shaved it.

111
00:13:42,323 --> 00:13:44,784
-Who asked you?
-Nobody.

112
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:55,503
-Know how to do the two-step?
-You bet.

113
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:08,516
-Wanna prove it?
-All right.

114
00:14:46,387 --> 00:14:48,431
-What's your name?
-Sissy.

115
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,434
-Who are you?
-Bud.

116
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:57,773
-Nice to meet you.
-Pleasure.

117
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:24,235
-Hey, Marshall.
-Bud.

118
00:16:25,194 --> 00:16:27,613
They got you carrying mud now?

119
00:16:27,738 --> 00:16:30,324
Beats the hell outta cutting foam glass!

120
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:36,247
-How did you and Sissy make out?
-That ain't none of your business.

121
00:16:36,372 --> 00:16:39,625
-None of my business?
-That's right.

122
00:16:51,721 --> 00:16:54,932
Y'all cut that shit out
or I'll throw you out of the club!

123
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:03,607
All right! Atta boy. That's my boy.

124
00:17:10,823 --> 00:17:14,952
-Marshall, when'd this thing get here?
-Cryer put it in this afternoon.

125
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:17,246
Said it might cut down on the fights.

126
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:22,168
Give all us cowboys something else
to hit besides each other.

127
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:48,611
This one's for you, darlin'.

128
00:17:49,862 --> 00:17:51,781
Make that needle move, Bud!

129
00:17:56,911 --> 00:17:59,664
-I wanna hit one, Bud.
-Come on, Sissy.

130
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:02,875
-Hold my beer, Jessie.
-Should I? OK.

131
00:18:07,088 --> 00:18:09,882
Come on, Sissy. You can do it.
Make 600.

132
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:15,888
Shit!

133
00:18:17,556 --> 00:18:20,893
-Doctor Davis.
-Just behave yourself.

134
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:23,562
It stings.

135
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:27,858
You gotta learn
there's certain things a girl can't do.

136
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:30,111
-Name one.
-I can name several.

137
00:18:30,236 --> 00:18:32,279
Pissin' on the side of a wall.

138
00:18:34,073 --> 00:18:38,703
-Getting laid with your pants still on.
-Why would you want to?

139
00:18:38,828 --> 00:18:41,080
-How do you do that?
-Is it broke?

140
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:45,334
Shit, no. She couldn't move
her fingers if it was broke. Look.

141
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:49,171
-It ain't broke.
-I broke my hand in a beer-joint fight.

142
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:53,009
You really know
when something's broken. You do.

143
00:18:53,134 --> 00:18:56,971
You can't move nothin'.
Your fingers get all swelled up.

144
00:18:58,848 --> 00:19:00,891
Shit.

145
00:19:02,518 --> 00:19:07,064
-Becky! Where's my eggs?
-Hold your horses! It's comin'!

146
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:10,568
-Hi, Bud.
-Hi, Bud.

147
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:21,620
-Shit.
-What's the matter?

148
00:19:21,746 --> 00:19:25,791
-Nothin'. Why don't you just go on?
-Just cos I was looking at them?

149
00:19:25,916 --> 00:19:29,920
I can't keep my eyes closed.
I just looked up and there they was.

150
00:19:31,172 --> 00:19:35,301
Why don't you just go on? They're
waitin'. Someone else'll take me home.

151
00:19:35,426 --> 00:19:40,306
Come on. You jealous of them?
Little cute girls you're jealous of?

152
00:19:40,431 --> 00:19:42,933
Don't tickle me.

153
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:46,437
-Don't tickle me or I'll wet my pants.
-You love this.

154
00:19:48,314 --> 00:19:50,816
-You hit me!
-Well, shit! You pinched me.

155
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:54,528
I don't care.
You're not supposed to hit girls.

156
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:56,405
Sissy!

157
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,574
-Hey, Sissy...
-I'm not talking to you.

158
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:00,409
-Where are you goin'?
-Home.

159
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:05,331
-How you think you're gonna get there?
-I got a thumb. I got a middle finger.

160
00:20:06,332 --> 00:20:10,336
-Come on, Sissy.
-Look, Bud, you hit me!

161
00:20:10,461 --> 00:20:13,547
I didn't hit you that hard!
You don't know what hard is.

162
00:20:13,673 --> 00:20:16,258
-Just leave me alone.
-Fine. Forget it.

163
00:20:16,384 --> 00:20:18,427
"Fine. Forget it. "

164
00:20:19,345 --> 00:20:22,640
That's fine with me. See if I care.

165
00:20:23,224 --> 00:20:24,725
Fine.

166
00:20:25,685 --> 00:20:27,812
She still pissed off?

167
00:20:43,661 --> 00:20:45,705
-Get in.
-Go to hell!

168
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:11,105
-Get in!
-No!

169
00:21:41,719 --> 00:21:44,388
Jesus Christ! I almost hit y'all!

170
00:22:05,326 --> 00:22:07,370
You wanna get married?

171
00:22:09,205 --> 00:22:10,956
Smile, y'all, smile!

172
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:14,585
-Can you get 'em all in?
-Smile.

173
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:17,546
-Uncle Bob! Come here!
-I already been in one.

174
00:22:18,631 --> 00:22:20,716
Nice!

175
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:23,886
You want me lookin' at the ring
or just showin' it?

176
00:22:24,553 --> 00:22:29,100
-You switch places with me.
-A little more this way. A little tighter.

177
00:22:29,225 --> 00:22:31,769
Can we do one like this?
Like on top of the cake.

178
00:22:36,315 --> 00:22:38,734
Show 'em your garter.

179
00:22:40,861 --> 00:22:43,489
I ain't got no stockings on.

180
00:22:43,614 --> 00:22:45,658
Let me take one.

181
00:22:46,909 --> 00:22:50,871
Now, Sissy, stand still.
And try to look sweet, honey.

182
00:22:50,997 --> 00:22:53,791
My legs are sweatin', Mamma.

183
00:23:03,092 --> 00:23:05,553
First dance to the newlyweds.

184
00:23:59,482 --> 00:24:01,400
-Don't peek.
-OK.

185
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:09,158
-Bud, I can't stand it. Are we there yet?
-Almost. Just hold on.

186
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:11,911
I'm gettin' sick to my stomach.

187
00:24:32,014 --> 00:24:34,058
All right. Here we go.

188
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,565
OK, right there. Ready?
On your mark, get set... go.

189
00:24:43,859 --> 00:24:47,488
It's ours! I put a down payment on it!
It's ours!

190
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:53,703
It's 50ft long, 12ft wide, it's got one
bedroom, every modern convenience,

191
00:24:53,828 --> 00:24:56,122
and you can move it if you want!

192
00:24:56,247 --> 00:24:58,290
Where's the keys?

193
00:25:01,252 --> 00:25:03,295
I know we got the keys here.

194
00:25:05,297 --> 00:25:08,342
Here we go!

195
00:25:08,467 --> 00:25:10,928
Bud, don't forget your bride. Come on.

196
00:25:12,596 --> 00:25:14,640
Hey, Bud! Has it got a water bed?

197
00:25:24,984 --> 00:25:27,445
And welcome, ladies and gentlemen,

198
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:30,114
to the Huntsville Prison Rodeo,

199
00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:33,034
where all the cowboys are convicts.

200
00:25:34,243 --> 00:25:37,455
Shit, Bud.
See the guys up there with the rifles?

201
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,623
See those guys?

202
00:25:42,001 --> 00:25:47,173
-OK, look at those guys.
-In white? Yeah, they're prisoners, too.

203
00:25:47,298 --> 00:25:49,759
Damn, those outlaws
make good cowboys.

204
00:25:49,884 --> 00:25:53,512
-How come?
-They don't give a shit if they get hurt.

205
00:25:53,637 --> 00:25:58,017
All they do is lay up for a while.
They'd rather do that than anything.

206
00:26:05,691 --> 00:26:09,862
-Wanna go back to the motel?
-No, I wanna watch the bulls.

207
00:26:16,577 --> 00:26:19,246
-God, they're so ugly!
-Who's first up?

208
00:26:19,372 --> 00:26:21,749
Wes Hightower.
Let's see what he can do.

209
00:26:21,874 --> 00:26:23,918
-Which number is he?
-25.

210
00:26:25,753 --> 00:26:29,173
Shit, they're gonna be mean, too.
All right.

211
00:26:30,257 --> 00:26:32,301
Cut him loose!

212
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:36,722
What happened?

213
00:26:39,392 --> 00:26:41,435
Is he all right?

214
00:26:50,403 --> 00:26:52,446
Goddamn! He's gettin' back on!

215
00:26:53,906 --> 00:26:58,661
I told you he was the roughest and
the toughest. I thought he was a goner!

216
00:26:58,786 --> 00:27:02,373
See, I told you these guys were tough.
Look at that.

217
00:27:02,498 --> 00:27:07,128
That bull looked like he was gonna
go over the wall, but not of his choice.

218
00:27:10,965 --> 00:27:13,009
Here we go! Wes Hightower!

219
00:27:24,854 --> 00:27:27,023
Who's next?

220
00:27:27,898 --> 00:27:30,484
-Hi, Sissy. How're you doing?
-Good.

221
00:27:31,027 --> 00:27:34,739
-What the hell's goin' on?
-That's Sherwood's new play toy.

222
00:27:34,864 --> 00:27:38,659
-Y'all want a beer?
-Shit, yeah. Give me two Lone Stars.

223
00:27:43,873 --> 00:27:46,459
-Here we go.
-Thank you.

224
00:28:01,182 --> 00:28:04,018
-Marshall, what are you doing?
-Hey, Sissy!

225
00:28:04,143 --> 00:28:06,145
-How are you doing?
-OK.

226
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,939
You ride that thing yet?

227
00:28:09,065 --> 00:28:11,108
Marshall, you ride that thing?

228
00:28:19,325 --> 00:28:20,910
I can't believe it!

229
00:28:21,035 --> 00:28:23,120
Hey, Marshall! Ride the bull!

230
00:28:23,245 --> 00:28:26,791
Shit, no! I'm gonna hang on
to my family jewels!

231
00:28:26,916 --> 00:28:30,503
-Where's your sporting blood?
-It's $2 for eight seconds.

232
00:28:30,628 --> 00:28:33,923
It's what they train rodeo riders on.
It's a bucking machine.

233
00:28:34,048 --> 00:28:35,966
You ride it and I'll watch you.

234
00:28:36,092 --> 00:28:38,552
-Hell, I'll ride it!
-No, you won't!

235
00:28:38,678 --> 00:28:42,306
-First you gotta sign a release.
-And give this lady $2.

236
00:28:42,431 --> 00:28:44,934
He's gonna bust his ass anyway.

237
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:51,524
Sign there. In case you bust your ass,
you're not gonna hold Gilley's liable.

238
00:28:52,358 --> 00:28:55,611
Hey, Bud! Come back here a minute.

239
00:28:55,736 --> 00:28:59,490
-You ever rode a bull before?
-No, but I rode some rank horses.

240
00:28:59,615 --> 00:29:02,493
-It's different. Right-or left-handed?
-Right.

241
00:29:02,618 --> 00:29:05,997
-Give him a left glove.
-It's opposite?

242
00:29:16,507 --> 00:29:19,802
-How the hell do you ride it?
-Put your glove in the rigging,

243
00:29:19,927 --> 00:29:24,265
then put your right nut in your left hand
and hang on!

244
00:29:38,904 --> 00:29:43,159
-Hell, I'm gonna ride again.
-That's the right attitude.

245
00:29:43,284 --> 00:29:46,412
You don't sign the release again.
Just another $2.

246
00:29:46,537 --> 00:29:49,957
-Boy, you got more balls than I got!
-Get your knees up.

247
00:29:50,082 --> 00:29:54,003
Get up close to that rigging as possible.
Give him a ride, Sam!

248
00:30:21,405 --> 00:30:25,117
I was so proud of you, Bud.
You looked so great up on that bull.

249
00:30:25,242 --> 00:30:28,162
You were the best one all night long.

250
00:30:28,287 --> 00:30:34,418
Well, I might have been the best one
all night long, but my balls are killin' me.

251
00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:38,506
Shit. Oh, man.

252
00:30:41,258 --> 00:30:43,719
Does that mean
we won't be able to do it?

253
00:30:45,805 --> 00:30:49,225
Well, I don't know. I just don't know.

254
00:30:52,228 --> 00:30:54,271
We'll just have to find out.

255
00:30:58,984 --> 00:31:01,028
I love you so much, Bud.

256
00:31:01,946 --> 00:31:03,990
I love you too, Sissy. Come here.

257
00:31:05,533 --> 00:31:07,576
Sweetheart.

258
00:31:13,874 --> 00:31:16,544
-You know what I really wanna do?
-What?

259
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,964
I wanna ride that bull.

260
00:31:20,756 --> 00:31:22,717
No. No way!

261
00:31:22,842 --> 00:31:27,096
-Why not?
-It's too dangerous! It ain't for girls.

262
00:31:29,348 --> 00:31:31,767
I gotta watch you. I do!

263
00:31:31,892 --> 00:31:34,103
First you wanna
punch the punchin' bag,

264
00:31:34,228 --> 00:31:37,940
and you're always ridin'
my pick-up and everything.

265
00:31:38,065 --> 00:31:40,109
Now you wanna ride the bull.

266
00:32:24,403 --> 00:32:26,364
-I'm next. I wanna ride it.
-No.

267
00:32:26,489 --> 00:32:28,240
-Jessie rode it.
-I told you no.

268
00:32:28,366 --> 00:32:32,078
-Bud, I think you oughta let her ride.
-I think I told you no.

269
00:32:32,203 --> 00:32:35,956
Bud! Thought you got enough
of this shit last night!

270
00:32:36,082 --> 00:32:38,709
-What speed's it on?
-It's on five tonight.

271
00:32:38,834 --> 00:32:41,504
Five? That's high, ain't it?

272
00:32:41,629 --> 00:32:44,173
Look at Gator. He's shitfaced.

273
00:32:45,091 --> 00:32:46,842
All right, let's go!

274
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:50,054
Stay on!

275
00:32:51,263 --> 00:32:53,307
Stay on, Gator!

276
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:02,858
-I'm gonna ride again.
-You can't ride again.

277
00:33:02,983 --> 00:33:04,193
Well, I am.

278
00:33:04,318 --> 00:33:06,737
-Bud, it's my turn.
-It's Big C's turn.

279
00:33:06,862 --> 00:33:10,574
-One more time.
-Everybody's waitin' in line. Real nice.

280
00:33:34,306 --> 00:33:36,017
Hey, I wanna ride.

281
00:33:36,142 --> 00:33:38,185
Hello, Steve.

282
00:33:39,937 --> 00:33:42,398
Wes. How're you doin'?

283
00:33:43,983 --> 00:33:45,735
Long time no see.

284
00:33:46,527 --> 00:33:49,196
Bet you ten bucks you can't throw me.

285
00:33:49,322 --> 00:33:52,742
I can't do any gambling
around the bull area here, Wes.

286
00:33:52,867 --> 00:33:54,910
Come on.

287
00:33:56,662 --> 00:33:58,581
-Ten bucks.
-All right.

288
00:33:58,706 --> 00:34:03,336
-What speed you got it on?
-It's on five. Get your ass up there.

289
00:34:03,461 --> 00:34:06,213
-I'll turn it up.
-Go ahead.

290
00:34:06,339 --> 00:34:10,217
-Steve, who is that guy?
-Just somebody I used to know, Bud.

291
00:34:11,385 --> 00:34:13,220
He sure does look familiar.

292
00:34:13,346 --> 00:34:17,016
-Hey, who is this guy?
-I don't know. I never seen him before.

293
00:34:17,141 --> 00:34:20,061
Looks like his shirt's made
out of his mamma's hairnet.

294
00:34:21,604 --> 00:34:24,482
-What's he doin'?
-Maybe he's lookin' up the bull's ass.

295
00:34:24,607 --> 00:34:26,650
He's turnin' it up.

296
00:34:29,987 --> 00:34:32,156
I don't care if he does look squirrelly.

297
00:34:32,281 --> 00:34:35,534
He brought his own glove with him.

298
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,787
Look, he's playin' with himself!

299
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:41,624
Go on, mister! Ride that thing!

300
00:34:43,084 --> 00:34:45,127
Ready, Wes?

301
00:34:51,842 --> 00:34:53,719
Hey, ride that thing!

302
00:35:07,149 --> 00:35:09,610
Damn! He's good.

303
00:35:09,735 --> 00:35:11,779
Hell of a ride!

304
00:35:15,533 --> 00:35:18,536
Good ride! OK, now it's my turn, Steve.

305
00:35:18,661 --> 00:35:22,999
Can't, Sissy. Gilley's fixin' to do a set
and he don't like the bull running.

306
00:35:23,124 --> 00:35:25,167
You're a real cowboy, ain't you?

307
00:35:25,876 --> 00:35:28,796
-Come on, let's dance.
-I'll see you in a bit, Sissy.

308
00:35:30,047 --> 00:35:32,258
Come on, Wes. Let's get a beer.

309
00:35:32,383 --> 00:35:34,051
-Quit that flirtin'.
-I wasn't.

310
00:35:34,176 --> 00:35:36,220
Was too.

311
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:46,374
Hoedown!

312
00:37:42,388 --> 00:37:45,224
-Just do it for me.
-Ask me how to become a bull rider.

313
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:49,645
In the afternoon? That's how I'm gonna
ride it. I'm gonna go in the afternoon.

314
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:53,357
-You jealous of her?
-I'm not jealous. Are you sore?

315
00:37:54,984 --> 00:37:57,069
You better not tell Bud, Marshall.

316
00:37:57,194 --> 00:37:59,405
-What's it worth?
-I wanna surprise him.

317
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:04,618
Becky! You tell that son of a bitch
to put extra onion on that. All right?

318
00:38:04,744 --> 00:38:08,080
-I want it extra well, too.
-OK.

319
00:38:09,165 --> 00:38:11,834
-If it's not, I'm sending it back.
-OK.

320
00:38:17,631 --> 00:38:21,218
-OK, I got it.
-He's got it. What you got?

321
00:38:21,344 --> 00:38:24,430
-A joke.
-You gonna give it to me?

322
00:38:24,555 --> 00:38:28,934
-Ask me how you become a bull rider.
-How do you become a bull rider?

323
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:31,437
-That was good, Marshall.
-All right.

324
00:38:31,562 --> 00:38:34,690
-You get a handful of marbles.
-OK.

325
00:38:34,815 --> 00:38:38,778
Get a handful of marbles,
you put them in your mouth, OK?

326
00:38:38,903 --> 00:38:41,113
Then you go to Gilley's
and ride that bull.

327
00:38:41,238 --> 00:38:45,993
Every time you ride that bull, you take
one of them marbles and spit it out.

328
00:38:46,118 --> 00:38:47,745
-You're drunk.
-Isn't he cute?

329
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:53,542
OK. And when you've lost all your
marbles, that's when you're a bull rider.

330
00:38:53,668 --> 00:38:55,169
Shit!

331
00:38:55,294 --> 00:38:57,338
That's a good one.

332
00:38:59,548 --> 00:39:03,052
Don't worry about anything.
I'm sorry I didn't get to Cryer,

333
00:39:03,177 --> 00:39:06,430
but I'll get to him
first thing in the morning.

334
00:39:06,555 --> 00:39:08,599
Let's get that burger.

335
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:15,481
What the hell was that?
What's he tippin' his hat at you for?

336
00:39:16,607 --> 00:39:18,651
Don't he know we're married?

337
00:39:19,485 --> 00:39:21,529
Hey, Tattoo! Lookee here! See this?

338
00:39:21,654 --> 00:39:25,157
That's a weddin' ring.
That means we're married. She's mine.

339
00:39:25,282 --> 00:39:27,326
-Don't be an asshole!
-OK?

340
00:39:28,536 --> 00:39:32,790
-All right, loosen up.
-See that? He slipped me the finger.

341
00:39:32,915 --> 00:39:35,793
-Would you calm down?
-I didn't see him.

342
00:39:35,918 --> 00:39:37,962
Just calm down, Bud.

343
00:39:38,879 --> 00:39:44,218
-Here's your food.
-Burger, extra onion. Ham and eggs.

344
00:39:44,343 --> 00:39:47,888
Cheese omelet.
And the chili of yours is coming.

345
00:39:50,683 --> 00:39:53,686
-This thing's still movin'.
-I can't help it.

346
00:39:53,811 --> 00:39:56,022
Well, then, put it back on the fire!

347
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:17,543
Bud, don't do this. It's stupid.

348
00:40:17,668 --> 00:40:20,963
Don't fight him.
You're drunker than Cotter Brown.

349
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:24,675
-Are you listening at all?
-Will you shut up? I mean it!

350
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,510
OK, fine!

351
00:40:29,388 --> 00:40:33,601
-Stop it!
-Let's get that burger now.

352
00:40:34,185 --> 00:40:35,519
Get him, Bud!

353
00:40:36,062 --> 00:40:38,147
Goldsmith! Bud, don't!

354
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:46,864
Get outta here!

355
00:40:47,323 --> 00:40:49,367
Hold on.

356
00:40:50,409 --> 00:40:52,453
Hold on a second.

357
00:40:56,332 --> 00:40:57,667
Sissy, take him home.

358
00:41:01,045 --> 00:41:03,089
Bud?

359
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:05,883
Bud, it's seven o'clock.

360
00:41:10,554 --> 00:41:13,641
If you're not goin' in to work,
I'll call you in sick.

361
00:41:15,101 --> 00:41:17,937
-Brought you some coffee.
-Get me a beer.

362
00:41:18,062 --> 00:41:21,482
-If they smell beer on your breath...
-Just get me a beer!

363
00:41:22,233 --> 00:41:23,651
Yes, sir.

364
00:41:31,283 --> 00:41:34,370
Sweetheart, are you sure
you're OK to go to work?

365
00:42:04,108 --> 00:42:06,152
-Hi, Daddy.
-Morning, honey.

366
00:42:10,906 --> 00:42:12,992
If it's OK, I wanna get off early today.

367
00:42:13,117 --> 00:42:16,746
That's all right with me,
if your mother don't mind.

368
00:42:17,955 --> 00:42:22,793
-Ma, I wanna get off early today, OK?
-It's OK with me if it's OK with him.

369
00:42:22,918 --> 00:42:24,211
Guess it's OK.

370
00:42:32,595 --> 00:42:36,682
-Better eat something. You'll get sick.
-No, I'll be all right.

371
00:42:51,822 --> 00:42:54,492
-Hi, Marshaling.
-Hi, Sissy.

372
00:42:59,664 --> 00:43:01,707
Fine. You're ridin' fine.

373
00:43:05,336 --> 00:43:07,546
-Hi, y'all.
-Hi, Sissy.

374
00:43:07,672 --> 00:43:09,965
-Hi, Sissy.
-Remember Wes?

375
00:43:11,217 --> 00:43:16,472
He's livin' out back. Workin' here.
Gonna help me run the bull.

376
00:43:17,306 --> 00:43:19,892
Get on up and take a ride.

377
00:43:21,268 --> 00:43:22,269
OK.

378
00:43:30,611 --> 00:43:36,158
Push, lift. Push, lift. All right. Turn loose
with that hand. Turn loose with it.

379
00:43:36,283 --> 00:43:39,996
Turn loose with it. All right.
Now stick it up in the air.

380
00:43:40,121 --> 00:43:44,458
-Up behind you. Turn your arm.
-Come on. Don't be scared.

381
00:43:53,968 --> 00:43:56,429
Hey, David.
Send me down some more mud.

382
00:43:57,304 --> 00:43:58,305
OK.

383
00:44:15,906 --> 00:44:17,950
Good God Almighty!

384
00:44:20,745 --> 00:44:22,872
Bud!

385
00:44:32,757 --> 00:44:34,050
Bud!

386
00:44:37,136 --> 00:44:41,015
-Ma'am, you are good!
-What are you grinnin' at?

387
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:44,602
Turn to the left. Hit it. In the well.

388
00:44:44,727 --> 00:44:48,856
Get that arm back. You look fine.
You're a bull rider, child!

389
00:44:56,697 --> 00:44:58,866
Don't move, Bud! Don't move!

390
00:45:00,451 --> 00:45:02,453
Arch your back, arch your back.

391
00:45:02,578 --> 00:45:04,580
Hang on, Bud.

392
00:45:04,705 --> 00:45:05,998
Hang on.

393
00:45:07,541 --> 00:45:09,585
-I can't take it!
-Stop it!

394
00:45:21,681 --> 00:45:25,059
Take it easy. You'll be all right.
We'll get you down.

395
00:45:25,726 --> 00:45:27,770
You'll be all right.

396
00:45:29,814 --> 00:45:32,483
I'm gonna go get the crane.

397
00:45:38,322 --> 00:45:41,659
-How long you been married?
-Not very long at all.

398
00:45:43,202 --> 00:45:47,373
-How long?
-I don't know. About a week, I guess.

399
00:45:48,332 --> 00:45:52,461
All right. Just pretend
like you're still on your honeymoon.

400
00:46:15,735 --> 00:46:19,947
-Hi. Bob told me what happened.
-Well, come on in.

401
00:46:20,072 --> 00:46:22,700
-I came to check on you.
-Can I get you a drink?

402
00:46:22,825 --> 00:46:25,077
Shoot, no, darlin'.

403
00:46:25,202 --> 00:46:29,540
-How are you?
-Fine. They've given me this codeine.

404
00:46:29,665 --> 00:46:31,709
Yeah?

405
00:46:33,627 --> 00:46:37,757
-Where's Sissy? Is she at work?
-Sissy. I'd better call her.

406
00:46:37,882 --> 00:46:42,928
If she finds out from somebody else
but me, she'll probably get worried.

407
00:46:47,308 --> 00:46:50,436
My God, Bud. Y'all live like pigs.

408
00:47:07,495 --> 00:47:09,538
What's the matter?

409
00:47:10,289 --> 00:47:14,293
Nothin' much.
He just almost got himself killed.

410
00:47:14,418 --> 00:47:16,253
-Killed?
-That's right.

411
00:47:16,379 --> 00:47:18,422
-Where is he?
-He's in the tub.

412
00:47:19,006 --> 00:47:21,050
Bud?

413
00:47:21,759 --> 00:47:25,721
-Bud, what happened?
-I fell off the scaffold.

414
00:47:25,846 --> 00:47:28,391
-You're kiddin'.
-No. 200 feet in the air.

415
00:47:28,516 --> 00:47:30,851
Damn near broke my back.
Where you been?

416
00:47:30,976 --> 00:47:34,855
I was with Jessie.
I guess I forgot the time. You OK?

417
00:47:34,981 --> 00:47:40,778
Bud? Listen, darlin', I'm gonna
go home now that Sissy's here. OK?

418
00:47:40,903 --> 00:47:43,698
I couldn't get to this bathroom.
Maybe Sissy can.

419
00:47:43,823 --> 00:47:45,574
Don't worry about that.

420
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:50,079
I put some tuna salads
in the icebox for y'all, OK?

421
00:47:50,204 --> 00:47:55,126
If you need anything else, just call.
You know where we are.

422
00:47:55,251 --> 00:47:57,294
Bye-bye, Sissy.

423
00:48:00,464 --> 00:48:03,592
Get me another beer.
I gotta soak longer.

424
00:48:03,718 --> 00:48:05,553
OK.

425
00:48:25,698 --> 00:48:29,160
What was you and Jessie up to?
I thought you didn't like her.

426
00:48:29,285 --> 00:48:32,371
Jessie's all right. Just girl talk.

427
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,045
I like my tuna salad
when it has pecans and apple,

428
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:41,756
not so much of this onion.

429
00:48:41,881 --> 00:48:45,509
We don't have no pecans and apples
cos you ain't been shoppin'.

430
00:48:45,634 --> 00:48:48,512
Corene asked me what I wanted.
I said corn bread.

431
00:48:48,637 --> 00:48:52,850
-She couldn't even find any instant.
-Don't complain against me, Bud.

432
00:48:52,975 --> 00:48:55,853
There's certain things
a man wants from his wife.

433
00:48:55,978 --> 00:49:00,191
Like to be here when he gets home and
to cook once in a while and clean up.

434
00:49:00,316 --> 00:49:02,360
Make good love to him.

435
00:49:04,236 --> 00:49:07,531
Look, I know that's good, OK?
But that ain't enough.

436
00:49:11,202 --> 00:49:13,788
I just thought we'd go to McDonald's.

437
00:49:13,913 --> 00:49:16,499
-Goldsmith! McDonald's again?!
-I work, too!

438
00:49:16,624 --> 00:49:19,335
You're making out like
I have nothing to do all day!

439
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:23,839
That's what I told her! I said
you worked! She said we live like pigs!

440
00:49:27,176 --> 00:49:29,220
She said that?

441
00:49:40,106 --> 00:49:42,900
Look, I don't wanna fight with you.

442
00:49:43,859 --> 00:49:46,320
Well, I don't wanna fight either.

443
00:49:50,199 --> 00:49:52,243
Wanna go to Gilley's tonight?

444
00:49:53,411 --> 00:49:55,454
No.

445
00:49:58,499 --> 00:50:00,543
Come here. Come here.

446
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,841
You mad at me?

447
00:50:13,347 --> 00:50:16,976
Come on, let's go to Gilley's.
It'll make us feel better.

448
00:50:18,269 --> 00:50:21,105
-OK.
-Go get dressed.

449
00:50:22,565 --> 00:50:25,735
-Eat your tuna with the onions.
-Clean up, pig!

450
00:50:53,971 --> 00:50:56,349
What the hell's he doin'
workin' the bull?

451
00:50:56,474 --> 00:51:00,311
-Steve gave him a job.
-How do you know that?

452
00:51:01,187 --> 00:51:04,315
-Jessie told me this afternoon.
-Sissy, come here!

453
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,484
See you.

454
00:51:08,027 --> 00:51:09,695
How are you doin'?

455
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:13,491
-I think you oughta ride.
-I can't. I got blisters on my ass.

456
00:51:13,616 --> 00:51:15,910
-Bud! How you feeling?
-All right.

457
00:51:16,035 --> 00:51:18,954
-How's that foot?
-It's my back that's killing me.

458
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:23,084
-You scared the dickens out of us, boy.
-I thought I was a goner.

459
00:51:23,209 --> 00:51:27,004
-I ain't no chickenshit.
-Well, get your ass up there.

460
00:51:27,922 --> 00:51:31,008
-Wes, what's it on?
-Eight. I'll turn it down.

461
00:51:31,133 --> 00:51:33,177
OK. I'm gonna ride.

462
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:43,854
-Sure looks like he's feelin' good now.
-I'm on codeine. I don't feel a thing.

463
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:47,274
-Girl on the bull!
-At least she won't hurt her balls!

464
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:50,528
-There's gonna be a bull on a girl.
-Hear what they're sayin'?

465
00:51:50,653 --> 00:51:54,115
Look up there.
Bud, d'you recognize her?

466
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:56,200
Hey, Sissy! Get down from there!

467
00:51:56,325 --> 00:51:58,661
-Bud, just watch, OK?
-Right now!

468
00:51:58,786 --> 00:52:00,830
She knows what she's doin'.

469
00:52:03,666 --> 00:52:08,629
Remember, keep your hand in the well.
Don't think about nothin' but the ride.

470
00:52:08,754 --> 00:52:11,007
-Show 'em how to do it, girl.
-OK.

471
00:52:11,882 --> 00:52:14,010
Turn that girl loose!

472
00:52:18,055 --> 00:52:20,725
Shit, Bud! She rides better than you do!

473
00:52:33,946 --> 00:52:37,408
-I wanted to show you I could ride it.
-You lied to me.

474
00:52:38,075 --> 00:52:41,912
I didn't lie. For Christ's sake,
I just wanted to ride the goddamn bull!

475
00:52:42,038 --> 00:52:45,082
OK, Tattoo. Let's see what you can do.

476
00:52:45,207 --> 00:52:48,502
-Jessie, turn it up!
-You can't ride that with your back!

477
00:52:48,627 --> 00:52:51,797
-Shut up!
-OK, you're gonna hurt yourself.

478
00:52:51,922 --> 00:52:55,343
-Be careful, Bud.
-I swear to God, take it easy.

479
00:53:00,264 --> 00:53:02,308
Shit!

480
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,827
-That was a good ride.
-Now ride it.

481
00:53:21,952 --> 00:53:23,829
-I don't want to.
-Ride it!

482
00:53:23,954 --> 00:53:27,166
-Leave her alone, Bud.
-Back off, Jessie! Ride it!

483
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:30,169
OK.

484
00:54:04,996 --> 00:54:07,039
That make you happy?

485
00:54:08,791 --> 00:54:13,504
Don't ride it again. Please?
Please don't ride it. You'll hurt yourself.

486
00:54:17,925 --> 00:54:21,846
-I'm gonna smack his ass this time.
-Take it easy.

487
00:54:25,474 --> 00:54:28,561
The bull's too fast. Easy!

488
00:54:30,896 --> 00:54:34,191
-You gotta stop him!
-Don't let this shit go too far.

489
00:54:46,329 --> 00:54:48,372
I've got him now.

490
00:55:00,634 --> 00:55:02,678
Bud!

491
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,979
You broke my goddamn arm!

492
00:55:15,816 --> 00:55:17,860
Wes, you shit!

493
00:55:21,155 --> 00:55:23,199
Come on! Out the door!

494
00:55:41,258 --> 00:55:44,512
-You layin' him?
-I ain't layin' him.

495
00:55:47,598 --> 00:55:49,058
You lied to me.

496
00:55:49,183 --> 00:55:52,144
I was with Jessie.
I just didn't say where.

497
00:55:52,269 --> 00:55:56,983
My daddy told me if a woman'll lie about
one thing, she'll lie about another.

498
00:55:57,108 --> 00:56:00,194
-Bud, just take off your shirt.
-Get away from me!

499
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:03,948
I don't need your help
and I don't want your help.

500
00:56:04,073 --> 00:56:06,409
I don't want you showin' off on that bull.

501
00:56:06,534 --> 00:56:10,287
-I wasn't showin' off!
-What the hell do you call it, then?

502
00:56:10,413 --> 00:56:13,165
-I call it riding it.
-Just riding it?

503
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:16,502
That's right. And I'm gonna ride it again,
as much as I want to!

504
00:56:16,627 --> 00:56:20,673
-You think you are, but you ain't.
-You're not my daddy!

505
00:56:20,798 --> 00:56:25,344
I'm the next best thing -your husband.
You ain't never riding it, ever!

506
00:56:28,264 --> 00:56:30,599
I think you're jealous cos I ride it better.

507
00:56:30,725 --> 00:56:32,435
-I'm what?
-Bud!

508
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,854
You hit me!

509
00:56:34,979 --> 00:56:37,565
Cut it out! Stop it!

510
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:40,318
-Come on! Get out!
-Where am I gonna go?!

511
00:56:40,443 --> 00:56:42,903
Go see your daddy! You like him better!

512
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:47,867
-Here! Take your keys!
-Fine!

513
00:56:49,994 --> 00:56:52,038
Goldsmith!

514
00:57:04,759 --> 00:57:10,097
I'll be up front. I'm better with one arm
than most of your guys are with two.

515
00:57:10,222 --> 00:57:12,058
I'll guarantee that.

516
00:57:12,183 --> 00:57:15,978
I'm sorry, Bud. There's not much
you can do here with a broken arm.

517
00:57:16,103 --> 00:57:21,150
And you're still on a probation period.
I can't keep you on a salary.

518
00:57:21,275 --> 00:57:24,987
Come back when the cast is off
and I'll put you back to work.

519
00:57:26,656 --> 00:57:29,659
Here's your severance pay.
And I am sorry, Bud.

520
00:57:30,701 --> 00:57:32,745
Thank you.

521
00:59:34,617 --> 00:59:36,744
Bud, don't start no shit in here.

522
00:59:48,839 --> 00:59:52,927
She oughta be able to hang on
with those thunder thighs.

523
00:59:54,011 --> 00:59:55,930
-Ever done this before?
-No.

524
00:59:56,055 --> 01:00:00,601
Don't worry, honey. Anything
he makes sore, I'll be glad to kiss.

525
01:00:07,942 --> 01:00:10,069
I'll get y'all more beer.

526
01:00:15,032 --> 01:00:20,496
Sissy! Just listen to me. Now, look,
that guy's an escaped convict.

527
01:00:20,621 --> 01:00:23,666
-He is not.
-He's in the prison rodeo program.

528
01:00:23,791 --> 01:00:26,544
-That guy's a convict.
-He's out on parole.

529
01:00:27,253 --> 01:00:31,799
-Wait a minute. You knew that?
-He told me today. I ain't talking to you.

530
01:00:33,050 --> 01:00:36,012
Fine. I'll find somebody else
who will talk to me.

531
01:00:36,137 --> 01:00:38,597
-Fine. Good luck.
-Good.

532
01:00:44,478 --> 01:00:49,442
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to
Gilley's, the world's largest nightclub.

533
01:00:52,528 --> 01:00:54,572
Wanna dance?

534
01:00:54,697 --> 01:00:56,741
Sure. Why not?

535
01:01:12,882 --> 01:01:14,925
-You all right?
-No.

536
01:01:23,351 --> 01:01:25,394
Can I help?

537
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:30,358
-Wanna dance?
-Why, sure.

538
01:01:30,483 --> 01:01:32,276
OK.

539
01:03:24,805 --> 01:03:27,642
So when are you gonna
take me home and rape me?

540
01:03:28,809 --> 01:03:32,188
-Whenever you get ready.
-I'm ready right now.

541
01:03:33,272 --> 01:03:35,107
Come on.

542
01:03:36,233 --> 01:03:38,694
I gotta tell my girlfriends I'm goin'.

543
01:03:40,237 --> 01:03:42,615
Got myself a cowboy. See y'all later.

544
01:03:43,866 --> 01:03:45,701
Bud!

545
01:03:47,828 --> 01:03:50,039
Bud!

546
01:03:51,791 --> 01:03:55,086
Bud! Bud, where are you goin'?

547
01:03:57,380 --> 01:03:59,423
You bitch!

548
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:01,634
Who's that?

549
01:04:02,343 --> 01:04:04,387
My wife.

550
01:04:05,012 --> 01:04:07,056
Hey, what's your problem?

551
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:20,945
-What's your name?
-Bud.

552
01:04:23,614 --> 01:04:26,075
Mine's Pam.

553
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,828
-Well, where are we goin', Pam?
-Uptown.

554
01:04:29,662 --> 01:04:34,000
Hey, cowboy. You're not just doin' this
to make your wife jealous, are you?

555
01:04:34,125 --> 01:04:36,377
Yep.

556
01:04:41,674 --> 01:04:43,718
I have a thing about cowboys.

557
01:04:44,844 --> 01:04:48,973
Just drives my daddy crazy.
He can't understand it.

558
01:04:50,141 --> 01:04:53,728
I told him "Daddy, most men today
are just too complicated. "

559
01:04:53,853 --> 01:04:59,025
Daddy goes to an analyst three times
a week. I like men with simple values.

560
01:05:00,192 --> 01:05:03,279
I like them independent, self-reliant,

561
01:05:04,155 --> 01:05:06,198
brave, strong,

562
01:05:07,116 --> 01:05:09,160
direct and open.

563
01:05:09,702 --> 01:05:11,746
"You mean dumb" he says.

564
01:05:13,247 --> 01:05:15,291
Daddy's a real scream.

565
01:05:16,751 --> 01:05:20,421
There's plenty of whiskey.
Pour me some bourbon.

566
01:05:20,546 --> 01:05:22,590
I'm gonna put some music on.

567
01:05:24,842 --> 01:05:27,219
What does your daddy do?

568
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:31,515
Daddy does oil.
And all that that implies.

569
01:05:36,812 --> 01:05:39,273
-You come to Houston proper much?
-No.

570
01:05:41,150 --> 01:05:43,819
It's my favorite city
in the whole world.

571
01:05:45,071 --> 01:05:47,365
It's just got so much energy.

572
01:06:04,006 --> 01:06:06,717
To cowboys.

573
01:06:06,842 --> 01:06:08,886
And all that that implies.

574
01:06:35,621 --> 01:06:38,499
Come on. I wanna show you something.

575
01:07:08,946 --> 01:07:13,951
<i>This stuff is called Mezcal con gusano,
which means "Mezcal with worm".</i>

576
01:07:14,994 --> 01:07:19,832
-It's got a worm in there?
-Yeah. A little worm floatin' around.

577
01:07:19,957 --> 01:07:21,751
It's sickening.

578
01:07:21,876 --> 01:07:26,839
The Mexicans say if you eat the worm,
you're gonna see visions.

579
01:07:28,257 --> 01:07:31,093
-Visions of what?
-I don't know.

580
01:07:31,969 --> 01:07:36,599
I ate a whole mess of 'em and I never
seen a vision yet, but I sure feel good.

581
01:07:38,267 --> 01:07:40,311
Well, what's that to?

582
01:07:41,562 --> 01:07:44,231
<i>La vida luna. "The crazy life. "</i>

583
01:07:45,566 --> 01:07:47,610
OK.

584
01:07:54,617 --> 01:07:57,119
You rob banks?

585
01:07:57,244 --> 01:07:59,538
I mean, Steve told me that.

586
01:08:00,081 --> 01:08:02,124
How many banks you rob?

587
01:08:02,249 --> 01:08:05,711
I don't really care how many
banks you robbed, but why?

588
01:08:07,046 --> 01:08:10,966
-Come here.
-I am right here. It's so small.

589
01:08:12,093 --> 01:08:14,637
No, you ain't. Come here.

590
01:08:16,013 --> 01:08:18,057
OK.

591
01:08:26,065 --> 01:08:28,109
Come here.

592
01:08:29,527 --> 01:08:31,570
OK.

593
01:08:36,575 --> 01:08:38,619
This is my favorite thing.

594
01:09:12,945 --> 01:09:16,365
See, the thing is, I can't do this to Bud.

595
01:09:17,783 --> 01:09:20,911
But I really appreciate
that thing with the worm.

596
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:24,081
I thought I could, but I can't.

597
01:09:27,585 --> 01:09:29,962
I really loved that worm and all that.

598
01:12:40,569 --> 01:12:42,613
Wes?

599
01:13:03,634 --> 01:13:05,678
Hi, cowboy.

600
01:13:06,971 --> 01:13:10,891
It didn't take much to find you.
I just called Gilley's.

601
01:13:12,184 --> 01:13:17,231
One of the girls who works in the office
said she'd been here a couple of times.

602
01:13:17,356 --> 01:13:19,400
Thought I'd come.

603
01:13:20,651 --> 01:13:22,695
Make your wife jealous again.

604
01:13:24,613 --> 01:13:30,161
Well, my wife is livin'
in a trailer outside Gilley's

605
01:13:30,286 --> 01:13:32,413
with an ex-convict.

606
01:13:32,538 --> 01:13:34,582
And I'm gettin' a divorce.

607
01:13:41,922 --> 01:13:43,758
Shit.

608
01:13:44,884 --> 01:13:46,385
Hello?

609
01:13:46,510 --> 01:13:48,429
Hi, Uncle Bob.

610
01:13:48,554 --> 01:13:50,598
Yeah. No, that's all right.

611
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:54,644
No, I got company.

612
01:13:55,895 --> 01:13:57,938
No, it ain't Sissy.

613
01:13:59,190 --> 01:14:02,068
Well, no, we're not really hungry, but...

614
01:14:04,570 --> 01:14:07,907
Well, that sounds good.
Hold on. I'll ask her.

615
01:14:08,032 --> 01:14:11,952
It's my Uncle Bob. My Aunt Corene
just made a homemade Karo nut pie,

616
01:14:12,078 --> 01:14:14,538
and we'll go over for dessert.

617
01:14:14,664 --> 01:14:16,165
We'd love to.

618
01:14:16,290 --> 01:14:18,334
Well, at least a couple of hours.

619
01:14:19,418 --> 01:14:21,462
All right, see you then. Bye.

620
01:14:37,144 --> 01:14:39,230
This pie is so good.

621
01:14:39,355 --> 01:14:44,527
Corene found this while she was goin'
through some old boxes the other day.

622
01:14:46,779 --> 01:14:49,281
I won that for bull-ridin' in '64.

623
01:14:49,407 --> 01:14:51,867
I didn't know you won first place.

624
01:14:51,993 --> 01:14:54,078
Look at that.

625
01:14:54,203 --> 01:14:57,665
You'd have been better than
Larry Mahan, if not for that accident.

626
01:14:57,790 --> 01:15:02,837
-He was in hospital for nearly a year.
-I fell off and the bull stomped me.

627
01:15:02,962 --> 01:15:08,217
I got a plastic bone in my leg and
a plastic plate up here in my head.

628
01:15:08,342 --> 01:15:12,221
-How well d'you know this pretty lady?
-Go ahead. Tell her.

629
01:15:12,346 --> 01:15:14,390
One plastic nut.

630
01:15:16,392 --> 01:15:19,312
He bullshits a lot,
but he's tellin' the truth.

631
01:15:19,437 --> 01:15:24,608
We're goin' to Gilley's tonight. Be
the first time since we took you there.

632
01:15:26,610 --> 01:15:29,655
-Y'all come with us.
-Why? What's happenin' out there?

633
01:15:29,780 --> 01:15:33,617
They are having
a Dolly Parton lookalike contest.

634
01:15:35,578 --> 01:15:37,747
Lord have mercy!

635
01:15:37,872 --> 01:15:42,877
Evening, ladies and gentlemen.
These are our Dolly Parton lookalikes.

636
01:15:44,795 --> 01:15:47,214
Now we give you
a chance to meet our finalists.

637
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:50,968
-I'm Judith Hanson.
-Trina Haynes.

638
01:15:51,093 --> 01:15:53,888
-Judy Manuelle.
-Kim Kimmons.

639
01:15:55,181 --> 01:15:56,807
Hi. I'm Chrystal Smith.

640
01:15:58,351 --> 01:16:03,981
-Hi. I'm Marshaling Mitchell.
-Hi. I'm Sandra Carmush.

641
01:16:04,106 --> 01:16:07,360
-Hi. I'm Louise Winter.
-Hi. I'm Jerry Hopkins.

642
01:16:08,194 --> 01:16:11,864
-Hi, y'all. I'm Mary Bailey.
-Big round of applause for our finalists!

643
01:16:18,746 --> 01:16:21,457
Now could we have
the decision from our judges?

644
01:16:21,582 --> 01:16:23,042
Thank you.

645
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:25,419
Miss Sandra Carmush!

646
01:16:33,177 --> 01:16:35,221
Eat your heart out.

647
01:16:36,222 --> 01:16:38,683
Congratulations! Ain't she a Dolly?

648
01:16:41,227 --> 01:16:46,065
For all you shitkickers out there,
it's rodeo time again here at Gilley's.

649
01:16:46,190 --> 01:16:50,236
And we're gonna have
our own indoor rodeo back there.

650
01:16:51,946 --> 01:16:54,073
That's just three weeks from tonight.

651
01:16:54,198 --> 01:16:56,659
We're gonna have a bull-riding contest,

652
01:16:56,784 --> 01:17:00,329
a punching-bag contest
and a dancing contest.

653
01:17:00,454 --> 01:17:03,332
For all you guys that wanna ride
that mechanical bull,

654
01:17:03,457 --> 01:17:08,295
we got a table set up for all you guys
that wanna join, or even you cowgirls.

655
01:17:08,421 --> 01:17:12,800
The entry forms are back there.
It's $10 per person, per event.

656
01:17:12,925 --> 01:17:15,386
So join up
and have a good time with us.

657
01:17:15,511 --> 01:17:19,682
Right now we're gonna have
a little music. "Cotton-Eyed Joe"!

658
01:17:21,851 --> 01:17:23,894
I really wanted to win.

659
01:17:26,147 --> 01:17:28,733
You were the prettiest one there!

660
01:17:28,858 --> 01:17:33,404
Let's go and look at that machine.
I wanna see what kind of machine it is.

661
01:17:43,247 --> 01:17:45,916
-You wanna ride this thing?
-Yeah.

662
01:18:14,904 --> 01:18:18,741
It's just an old El Toro.
I trained on one when I was rodeoin'.

663
01:18:20,117 --> 01:18:22,370
Real good, Norman.

664
01:18:22,495 --> 01:18:25,039
-I wanna ride it.
-All right. Come on.

665
01:18:53,192 --> 01:18:55,903
Look at that. Her nipples are hard!

666
01:18:56,028 --> 01:18:59,740
-Come on, Sissy! Do your stuff!
-She ain't got no glove on.

667
01:18:59,865 --> 01:19:01,742
She don't need one for this.

668
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:15,464
Hell, she rides better
without a glove than I do with one.

669
01:19:21,721 --> 01:19:24,807
That's better than a vibrator, ain't it?

670
01:19:31,063 --> 01:19:34,567
All right! Come on, Sissy! Go!

671
01:19:36,944 --> 01:19:38,988
Come on!

672
01:19:40,990 --> 01:19:43,743
She's all right, I guess. I've seen better.

673
01:20:00,676 --> 01:20:02,720
Come on, Sissy! Go!

674
01:20:09,143 --> 01:20:11,604
Let's go. Come on, let's go.

675
01:20:15,566 --> 01:20:17,860
You sure made Bud jealous.

676
01:20:19,612 --> 01:20:23,324
Listen, y'all, I think maybe
we better call it a night.

677
01:20:23,449 --> 01:20:27,912
Hell, no! I'm just ready to party. Let's
go to that place you was talkin' about.

678
01:20:28,037 --> 01:20:32,583
-Elan's?
-I can't go anyplace dressed like this!

679
01:20:32,708 --> 01:20:36,462
-She can go like that, can't she?
-I know a place where it won't matter.

680
01:20:36,587 --> 01:20:40,091
What the hell!
Pop them titties and let's get rollin'.

681
01:20:40,216 --> 01:20:42,593
All right. Here goes!

682
01:20:50,643 --> 01:20:54,397
-Hey, Carol!
-Hi, Pam. How you doin'?

683
01:20:54,522 --> 01:20:56,565
-Hello, Pam.
-Hey, Earl.

684
01:20:56,691 --> 01:21:01,278
Could you help me ride that buck?
Good enough to kick ass in that rodeo?

685
01:21:01,404 --> 01:21:03,322
Why, hell, yeah!

686
01:21:03,447 --> 01:21:07,910
There used to be a machine at the
Circle Eight I trained on for rodeoin'.

687
01:21:08,035 --> 01:21:10,538
-Think we could use it?
-I imagine.

688
01:21:10,663 --> 01:21:13,582
How long you think it'd be
till I get good enough to win?

689
01:21:13,708 --> 01:21:17,003
-When's that cast comin' off?
-Next week.

690
01:21:17,128 --> 01:21:20,131
-Let's go out tomorrow and look at it.
-Hell, yes!

691
01:21:20,256 --> 01:21:22,091
All right!

692
01:21:22,216 --> 01:21:26,971
-Three Jack Daniel's!
-Two. I'm having bourbon and Coke.

693
01:22:48,386 --> 01:22:54,100
Bud, in some ways, a bull like this
is harder to ride than a real one.

694
01:22:54,225 --> 01:22:58,604
With a real one, you can watch his head
and see which way he's apt to move.

695
01:22:58,729 --> 01:23:04,110
With one of these, the treachery of the
bull depends on the man operating it.

696
01:23:20,710 --> 01:23:24,255
If you wanna ride it right,
you gotta learn style and form,

697
01:23:24,380 --> 01:23:29,051
because you're competing against real
bull riders, not just mechanical ones.

698
01:23:29,176 --> 01:23:33,681
I can tell you how to score points.
I can't show you because I'm too fat!

699
01:23:33,806 --> 01:23:37,685
If you listen to me, you can win.
If you don't, you won't. OK?

700
01:24:01,542 --> 01:24:03,377
Bud?

701
01:24:09,550 --> 01:24:11,719
Bud?

702
01:24:12,094 --> 01:24:15,139
That's it! Yeah! Keep kicking!

703
01:24:15,264 --> 01:24:17,975
That's what you're gonna be
judged on -your style.

704
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:20,936
Good! Good! Yeah!

705
01:24:21,062 --> 01:24:25,316
You gotta do more than stay on
to win a rodeo. You gotta have flair!

706
01:24:25,441 --> 01:24:30,446
-Kick it! Keep that hand up!
-That's better?

707
01:24:31,739 --> 01:24:35,034
"Dear Bud, sorry about last night. "

708
01:24:35,159 --> 01:24:39,538
"I was kind of drunk...
Well, I was drunk. "

709
01:24:40,581 --> 01:24:43,793
"I woke up feelin' awful
about life and other stuff. "

710
01:24:47,004 --> 01:24:50,049
"Maybe we could be friends again. "

711
01:24:50,174 --> 01:24:52,218
"Maybe more. "

712
01:24:54,512 --> 01:24:56,973
"I didn't even mind cleanin' up much."

713
01:24:58,099 --> 01:25:01,519
"I didn't even mind cleanin' up... much. "

714
01:25:03,938 --> 01:25:07,858
"If you want to call me,
I'll wait at Gilley's all afternoon. "

715
01:25:11,237 --> 01:25:13,280
"Bye. "

716
01:25:15,783 --> 01:25:19,620
"Love, your not-yet-ex-wife, Sissy. "

717
01:25:20,538 --> 01:25:22,581
"PS... "

718
01:25:27,586 --> 01:25:29,296
"PS... "

719
01:25:30,673 --> 01:25:33,759
"I miss you. "

720
01:26:05,666 --> 01:26:07,710
Bud?

721
01:26:10,671 --> 01:26:14,425
-I was just leavin'.
-Good.

722
01:26:35,363 --> 01:26:38,324
Hi. How'd you get in?

723
01:26:38,741 --> 01:26:40,785
The door was open.

724
01:26:42,244 --> 01:26:47,166
What did you do?
Damn! You cleaned up the place.

725
01:26:47,291 --> 01:26:49,293
All right!

726
01:26:49,418 --> 01:26:52,338
The bathroom, bedroom.

727
01:26:52,463 --> 01:26:54,507
Flowers!

728
01:26:54,632 --> 01:26:58,719
This is great! I just love
a woman's touch around the house.

729
01:26:58,844 --> 01:27:00,888
I mean it.

730
01:27:21,492 --> 01:27:24,620
What are you doing with yourself now?

731
01:27:24,745 --> 01:27:27,540
Doc told me this cast
could come off first of the week.

732
01:27:27,665 --> 01:27:30,960
Thought I'd take it off a day early.
Save some money.

733
01:27:32,753 --> 01:27:35,506
Look, I ain't got
your kind of money, right?

734
01:27:37,842 --> 01:27:39,885
Every little bit helps.

735
01:27:41,304 --> 01:27:47,601
Uncle Bob told me if I work a double
shift, I can make up to $16 an hour.

736
01:27:47,727 --> 01:27:52,189
How d'you like that? Turn that up.
That's my favorite song.

737
01:27:52,315 --> 01:27:54,734
I didn't realize you made
so much at the plant.

738
01:27:55,318 --> 01:27:59,071
Hell, yeah. How come you think
I came to Houston? For my health?

739
01:28:00,823 --> 01:28:04,410
What you do is this: Come to Houston,

740
01:28:04,535 --> 01:28:06,746
make some extra money,

741
01:28:06,871 --> 01:28:09,915
then you go back home
and get yourself a piece of land.

742
01:28:10,041 --> 01:28:12,918
Course, with the high cost
of livin' and...

743
01:28:14,420 --> 01:28:18,799
all the things I've been through lately,
I haven't been able to save a dime.

744
01:28:23,804 --> 01:28:27,016
Pam? I said turn it up.
I can't hardly hear it.

745
01:28:29,352 --> 01:28:32,855
-What are you doin'?
-Nothin'. Just listenin'.

746
01:28:36,567 --> 01:28:40,112
I never met a cowboy who didn't talk
about going back to the country.

747
01:28:40,237 --> 01:28:43,908
Yeah, well, I guess
it's all bullshit anyway.

748
01:28:46,577 --> 01:28:49,872
Course, if I won that rodeo,
it could all come true.

749
01:28:55,419 --> 01:28:57,463
Bud?

750
01:28:57,588 --> 01:28:59,048
What?

751
01:28:59,173 --> 01:29:03,219
I'm gonna bring some clothes here
and stay with you for a while.

752
01:29:03,344 --> 01:29:06,263
You need a woman
to take care of you. All right?

753
01:29:08,307 --> 01:29:10,351
Suit yourself.

754
01:29:17,316 --> 01:29:19,860
Marshaling?

755
01:29:19,986 --> 01:29:22,196
Bud still hasn't called?

756
01:29:22,321 --> 01:29:24,615
No, he hasn't.

757
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:28,035
I'm gonna go back inside,
so you know where I am.

758
01:29:28,744 --> 01:29:30,371
OK.

759
01:31:00,544 --> 01:31:05,049
Hey, Bud!
Want somethin' to eat? Drink?

760
01:31:06,384 --> 01:31:08,219
OK.

761
01:31:59,478 --> 01:32:03,816
-Damn good! Damn good, Bud!
-Thanks, Dwight.

762
01:32:03,941 --> 01:32:09,739
Now go out and hang around Gilley's
and watch that fellow run that bull.

763
01:32:09,864 --> 01:32:11,824
That sounds like a good idea.

764
01:33:13,928 --> 01:33:15,972
Wes?

765
01:33:28,150 --> 01:33:30,903
Home a little early, ain't you?

766
01:33:31,028 --> 01:33:32,571
No.

767
01:33:53,759 --> 01:33:56,429
Marshaling was just leavin'.

768
01:34:11,277 --> 01:34:15,406
-Excuse me. I'm sorry, Sissy.
-Don't matter. See you later.

769
01:34:23,831 --> 01:34:27,335
You can't expect a man like me
to be faithful to any woman.

770
01:34:47,063 --> 01:34:49,106
You buy cigarettes?

771
01:34:59,283 --> 01:35:01,535
Pick it up.

772
01:35:01,661 --> 01:35:03,829
Pick it up yourself.

773
01:35:04,955 --> 01:35:05,998
No!

774
01:35:06,123 --> 01:35:08,084
Pick it up.

775
01:35:20,179 --> 01:35:22,223
Pick it up.

776
01:35:23,224 --> 01:35:25,267
Thank you.

777
01:35:25,935 --> 01:35:27,979
Fix me something to eat.

778
01:35:29,355 --> 01:35:30,982
Fix it yourself.

779
01:35:32,191 --> 01:35:34,235
Fix me somethin' to eat!

780
01:35:54,839 --> 01:35:56,882
Gonna storm.

781
01:35:58,426 --> 01:36:00,886
-Howdy.
-Hi.

782
01:36:01,846 --> 01:36:05,391
-Where you been?
-Circle Eight with Uncle Bob.

783
01:36:05,516 --> 01:36:07,560
Rode that bull up to ten today.

784
01:36:09,353 --> 01:36:12,189
-What's that? It smells good.
-Stroganoff.

785
01:36:14,358 --> 01:36:18,529
There's a party later tonight at Cowboy
for some friends of mine.

786
01:36:19,697 --> 01:36:21,741
My daddy might go.

787
01:36:22,658 --> 01:36:26,287
You go on ahead. I'm gonna work
the graveyard shift tonight.

788
01:36:28,622 --> 01:36:30,666
Again?

789
01:36:34,545 --> 01:36:37,006
Pays time and a half. I've got to.

790
01:36:45,848 --> 01:36:50,061
I'm gonna take a nap.
Wake me up in an hour and a half.

791
01:36:52,438 --> 01:36:55,066
I'm goin' to watch
that son of a bitch run that bull.

792
01:36:55,191 --> 01:36:58,069
And then I'm goin' right to work,
so don't forget.

793
01:37:01,489 --> 01:37:04,492
-Aren't you hungry?
-No. I'll eat when I get up.

794
01:37:22,551 --> 01:37:25,388
I don't want you to go
to Gilley's without me.

795
01:37:26,722 --> 01:37:29,642
I gotta watch the man's technique.

796
01:37:30,935 --> 01:37:33,396
OK. I'll go.

797
01:37:36,148 --> 01:37:38,192
I'll just go to Cowboy later.

798
01:37:40,277 --> 01:37:44,031
You don't care if I go to the party?
You won't be jealous?

799
01:37:44,657 --> 01:37:45,950
Nope.

800
01:37:46,075 --> 01:37:48,119
Not even a little?

801
01:37:49,245 --> 01:37:54,166
Look, I hope I learned a lesson
about being jealous from Sissy.

802
01:37:54,291 --> 01:37:57,670
I hope I'm the kind of a man
who can learn from experience.

803
01:37:57,795 --> 01:38:00,339
Not everybody does.

804
01:38:00,464 --> 01:38:04,093
Contrary to what you or your daddy
think, all cowboys ain't dumb.

805
01:38:04,218 --> 01:38:07,221
Some of them got the smarts
real good. Like me.

806
01:38:07,346 --> 01:38:08,973
I'm sure.

807
01:38:11,684 --> 01:38:15,062
-What have you done now?
-What are you talkin' about?

808
01:38:16,981 --> 01:38:19,025
You bought me another shirt.

809
01:38:20,985 --> 01:38:23,237
You are crazy, girl!

810
01:38:26,282 --> 01:38:29,076
I had that one made
for you, sweetheart.

811
01:38:30,202 --> 01:38:33,372
Thank you. It's real nice.

812
01:38:39,754 --> 01:38:41,505
Uncle Bob!

813
01:38:41,631 --> 01:38:43,591
-Hey, Bud!
-How you feelin'?

814
01:38:43,716 --> 01:38:47,470
Real good. You stop off at Gilley's
on the way over here?

815
01:38:47,595 --> 01:38:52,808
No. I wanted to, but Pam
didn't wake me up on time.

816
01:38:52,933 --> 01:38:55,603
I was so goddamn mad, I tell you.

817
01:38:56,812 --> 01:39:00,483
I guess she just don't want me
bein' where Sissy is or somethin'.

818
01:39:00,608 --> 01:39:02,652
Yeah.

819
01:39:02,777 --> 01:39:05,363
-I saw Sissy today.
-Yeah?

820
01:39:05,488 --> 01:39:08,240
-What did she say?
-Well, not very much.

821
01:39:08,366 --> 01:39:11,118
She gave me the finger.
I gave her the finger.

822
01:39:11,243 --> 01:39:13,913
Well... I guess it's over. I don't know.

823
01:39:15,247 --> 01:39:20,086
You know, Bud, sometimes even
a cowboy's gotta swallow his pride

824
01:39:20,211 --> 01:39:22,254
and hold on to somebody he loves.

825
01:39:23,381 --> 01:39:25,424
-What do you mean?
-Hell, I know.

826
01:39:25,549 --> 01:39:30,179
I pretty near lost Corene and the kids
a couple of times just cos of pride.

827
01:39:30,304 --> 01:39:35,017
You think that old pride is gonna
choke you goin' down but, I tell you,

828
01:39:35,977 --> 01:39:40,940
ain't a night goes by I don't thank the
Boss for givin' me a big enough throat.

829
01:39:42,316 --> 01:39:47,279
Without Corene and them kids, I'd just
be a pile of shit in a cantaloupe patch,

830
01:39:47,405 --> 01:39:49,448
just drawin' flies!

831
01:39:50,533 --> 01:39:53,369
-I guess so.
-Think about it, Bud.

832
01:39:53,494 --> 01:39:57,123
Pride's one of them seven deadlies,
you know what I mean?

833
01:39:59,292 --> 01:40:00,960
-Bob?
-Yes, sir?

834
01:40:01,085 --> 01:40:04,171
-Check 309 and gauge it for me.
-You betcha!

835
01:40:04,297 --> 01:40:06,924
Thanks, partner.
You boys go and help Bud.

836
01:40:07,049 --> 01:40:09,552
What are you guys doin' here?

837
01:40:09,677 --> 01:40:12,430
-Freezin', Bud!
-Come to help me?

838
01:40:12,555 --> 01:40:15,891
They called a bunch of us out.
Said it's gonna rain tonight.

839
01:40:16,017 --> 01:40:20,021
That's good, cos I thought I was
gonna do this all alone. Help me.

840
01:40:25,443 --> 01:40:28,195
Goddamn! I hate that lightning!

841
01:40:28,321 --> 01:40:30,364
Mudder, four inch by ninety.

842
01:40:35,870 --> 01:40:37,955
Goddamn!

843
01:40:39,123 --> 01:40:41,167
Shit!

844
01:40:50,009 --> 01:40:52,595
-Uncle Bob!
-Get the hell outta there!

845
01:40:52,887 --> 01:40:55,681
-Bud!
-Get down!

846
01:40:55,806 --> 01:40:59,518
-Move back!
-Get outta here! Go on!

847
01:40:59,644 --> 01:41:01,687
Get back!

848
01:41:02,480 --> 01:41:04,523
Get him back!

849
01:41:20,039 --> 01:41:22,500
Let us pray.

850
01:41:22,625 --> 01:41:27,213
Our Father, which art in Heaven,
Hallowed be thy name,

851
01:41:27,338 --> 01:41:29,840
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done,

852
01:41:29,966 --> 01:41:33,302
On earth as it is in Heaven.

853
01:41:33,427 --> 01:41:37,723
Give us this day our daily bread,
And forgive us our trespasses,

854
01:41:37,848 --> 01:41:41,268
As we forgive those
who trespass against us.

855
01:41:41,394 --> 01:41:45,189
Lead us not into temptation,
Deliver us from evil,

856
01:41:45,398 --> 01:41:47,817
For thine is the kingdom,
The power and the glory,

857
01:41:47,942 --> 01:41:50,194
For ever and ever. Amen.

858
01:42:04,125 --> 01:42:05,626
Thank you, pallbearers.

859
01:42:05,751 --> 01:42:09,130
Take your boutonnieres
and place them on the casket.

860
01:42:44,707 --> 01:42:46,667
Aunt Corene.

861
01:42:46,792 --> 01:42:48,210
Sissy.

862
01:42:48,336 --> 01:42:50,630
-I'm so sorry.
-Sweetheart.

863
01:42:50,755 --> 01:42:54,592
-Nobody called me or nothin'.
-Thanks so much for coming.

864
01:42:58,554 --> 01:43:00,973
-I loved Uncle Bob.
-I know you did, darlin'.

865
01:43:01,098 --> 01:43:04,810
-Bob loved you, too. You know that.
-Come on, Mamma.

866
01:43:05,936 --> 01:43:07,980
Take care.

867
01:43:10,191 --> 01:43:13,778
-Thanks for coming.
-He was my uncle, too.

868
01:43:13,903 --> 01:43:15,946
I mean, he still is by marriage.

869
01:43:16,989 --> 01:43:19,033
Our divorce ain't final yet.

870
01:43:19,992 --> 01:43:25,498
I just... you know, I wasn't able
to get to the papers, so...

871
01:43:25,623 --> 01:43:27,667
Doesn't matter.

872
01:43:30,086 --> 01:43:33,297
Uncle Bob really wanted
you to be happy. You happy?

873
01:43:34,507 --> 01:43:37,301
Hell, yes, I'm happy.
How about you? You happy?

874
01:43:37,426 --> 01:43:40,262
Shit. Yeah, I really am.

875
01:43:40,388 --> 01:43:43,391
I finally got what I wanted.
I got a real cowboy.

876
01:43:45,267 --> 01:43:48,020
I got what I wanted, too.
I got myself a real lady.

877
01:43:48,145 --> 01:43:52,066
-Bud, the family car is waiting.
-Family car is waitin'.

878
01:43:53,234 --> 01:43:55,903
I ain't gonna be here after tonight.

879
01:43:58,114 --> 01:44:02,034
Wes... There just ain't much life
for us here, and he can't get a job.

880
01:44:02,159 --> 01:44:06,330
He's gonna win that rodeo tonight.
We're gonna take off.

881
01:44:07,123 --> 01:44:08,958
That sounds real good.

882
01:44:09,083 --> 01:44:12,878
'Cept how's he plannin' to win
the rodeo when he's runnin' the bull?

883
01:44:13,004 --> 01:44:17,091
He ain't. Sherwood fired his ass
cos he's hurtin' too many people.

884
01:44:17,216 --> 01:44:21,262
Purse is up to $5,000. Wes says
that'll get us deep into Mexico.

885
01:44:22,680 --> 01:44:25,641
-Don't suppose you'll be there tonight.
-No.

886
01:44:26,100 --> 01:44:28,394
No.

887
01:44:28,519 --> 01:44:30,563
Bye, y'all.

888
01:44:38,863 --> 01:44:40,906
Bye, Pam.

889
01:45:45,137 --> 01:45:47,807
I've got somethin' for you, darlin'.

890
01:45:49,016 --> 01:45:54,230
Bob told me just last Monday night,
just right before he went to bed that...

891
01:45:54,355 --> 01:45:59,151
he wanted you to have this and to wear
it tonight at the rodeo, for good luck.

892
01:46:04,865 --> 01:46:08,285
Well, I ain't goin' to the rodeo tonight.

893
01:46:08,411 --> 01:46:10,371
I don't feel like I can.

894
01:46:12,832 --> 01:46:17,378
Please take it, Bob... Bud!
Listen to that.

895
01:46:25,303 --> 01:46:29,473
You take that.
You take it tonight for good luck.

896
01:46:29,598 --> 01:46:33,728
I'll take it. I'd be proud to own it.

897
01:46:33,853 --> 01:46:37,982
But not for tonight, not for good luck.

898
01:46:43,404 --> 01:46:49,577
You know... Bob kind of forgot about
his rodeo days till you come along.

899
01:46:49,702 --> 01:46:54,624
And... he even forgot
where he put that belt buckle.

900
01:46:54,749 --> 01:46:58,044
-I had a hell of a time findin' it.
-I bet you did.

901
01:46:59,420 --> 01:47:04,634
Now that it's turned up again,
I don't want it retired.

902
01:47:04,759 --> 01:47:07,678
I wanna give it to somebody
who's gonna use it.

903
01:49:39,497 --> 01:49:42,458
All right. Welcome to Gilley's rodeo!

904
01:49:45,628 --> 01:49:49,006
We got a couple of clowns here.
Couple of real funny bones.

905
01:49:49,131 --> 01:49:52,301
Give them a hand, too.
All right? Yeah! OK!

906
01:49:52,426 --> 01:49:58,391
Folks, this rodeo is gonna be run just
like any rodeo right across this country.

907
01:49:58,516 --> 01:50:00,142
The same way.

908
01:50:00,267 --> 01:50:06,524
Now, each judge is gonna give
1 to 25 points for the bull,

909
01:50:06,649 --> 01:50:09,402
1 to 25 points for the rider,

910
01:50:09,527 --> 01:50:13,364
for a combined possible score
of 100 points.

911
01:50:13,823 --> 01:50:19,745
Now, the five top contestants are gonna
compete in the short go-round,

912
01:50:19,870 --> 01:50:23,416
and we're gonna combine the scores
on this ride and that ride,

913
01:50:23,541 --> 01:50:27,837
and out of that we're gonna have
the winner of that $5,000 jackpot!

914
01:50:29,714 --> 01:50:33,718
Tonight the bull is wild!
Turned all the way up to 12.

915
01:50:33,843 --> 01:50:37,596
Let's have that first contestant
up there: Howard Heston.

916
01:50:45,229 --> 01:50:47,523
Sorry about that, Howard. You bet.

917
01:50:47,648 --> 01:50:53,654
Next contestant, ladies and gentlemen:
Number 155, the Great Tanker.

918
01:50:56,240 --> 01:50:58,826
All right, Tank. You ready?
Hit him, Sam!

919
01:51:06,959 --> 01:51:09,003
Pin that on me.

920
01:51:09,795 --> 01:51:14,050
That's it! He made that eight seconds
look good, didn't he, folks?

921
01:51:14,175 --> 01:51:16,469
You betcha.

922
01:51:17,511 --> 01:51:19,847
Let's look at that score.

923
01:51:21,557 --> 01:51:24,018
Hey! Look at that now! All right!

924
01:51:29,357 --> 01:51:32,276
All right. Thank goodness
for the clowns.

925
01:51:32,401 --> 01:51:36,614
Number 144, folks! This is JR Fisk.

926
01:51:36,739 --> 01:51:38,824
All right! Yeah!

927
01:51:41,160 --> 01:51:43,788
You ready, JR? He's ready.

928
01:51:43,913 --> 01:51:45,957
Give him a ride, Sam.

929
01:52:42,388 --> 01:52:46,642
Hell. Some gotta win
and some gotta lose.

930
01:52:46,767 --> 01:52:49,520
If the bull don't kill him,
the clowns will!

931
01:52:56,652 --> 01:52:59,113
Hey. You came out after all?

932
01:53:02,366 --> 01:53:06,078
-Bud, sorry to hear about your uncle.
-Thank you.

933
01:53:06,203 --> 01:53:08,164
Good luck tonight.

934
01:53:19,300 --> 01:53:24,347
Next contestant: Number 106,
Mr. Wes Hightower.

935
01:54:21,821 --> 01:54:24,115
Let's take a look at that score here.

936
01:54:25,658 --> 01:54:27,618
-That was good.
-It was all right.

937
01:54:28,661 --> 01:54:33,291
An 81! All right!
That there's the highest score tonight!

938
01:54:33,416 --> 01:54:37,753
-That was a pussy ride you gave me.
-Why don't you take it up with Sam?

939
01:54:39,213 --> 01:54:43,259
All right. Next rider here: Number 48.

940
01:54:55,354 --> 01:54:58,858
Next contestant: Bud Davis.

941
01:55:22,506 --> 01:55:24,550
Hit him, Sam!

942
01:55:42,318 --> 01:55:44,028
All right!

943
01:55:44,153 --> 01:55:50,576
That was a fabulous bull ride
by Bud Davis, number 87.

944
01:55:50,701 --> 01:55:52,995
Now, let's take a look at that score.

945
01:56:03,422 --> 01:56:06,884
A 79! Well, all right!

946
01:56:07,593 --> 01:56:10,262
That puts Bud Davis in the top five.

947
01:56:12,306 --> 01:56:14,350
Boy's been practicing.

948
01:56:21,357 --> 01:56:26,779
All right, everybody, we're down to our
five finalists in our bull-riding contest.

949
01:56:26,904 --> 01:56:29,824
How about a good, big
round of applause for 'em?

950
01:56:32,660 --> 01:56:36,372
We're also down to our six finalists
in our dance contest.

951
01:56:39,292 --> 01:56:42,795
Now that the dancers have caught
their breath, the big finale!

952
01:56:42,920 --> 01:56:45,047
Here's the Charlie Daniels Band!

953
01:57:13,659 --> 01:57:17,246
-When did you say I was up?
-You're gonna be in fifth position.

954
01:57:17,371 --> 01:57:20,750
You'll be our final rider.
We put everybody's name in a hat,

955
01:57:20,875 --> 01:57:24,754
drew positions for the short go-round.
Gives everybody the same shot.

956
01:57:46,942 --> 01:57:51,947
Right! All right! A nice round
of applause for Gene McLaughlin.

957
01:57:52,073 --> 01:57:53,574
All right. Here we are now.

958
01:57:53,699 --> 01:57:56,994
We're down to the five finalists,
and let's get on with it.

959
01:57:57,119 --> 01:58:00,623
Lloyd Smith, number 57.

960
01:58:03,209 --> 01:58:06,754
Lloyd had a 75
on the first go-round, folks.

961
01:58:06,879 --> 01:58:09,382
Let's move him out.
Are you ready, Lloyd?

962
01:58:09,507 --> 01:58:11,550
Give him a ride, Sam.

963
01:58:20,351 --> 01:58:22,395
All right.

964
01:58:24,105 --> 01:58:28,609
Yeah. That's right. A lot of help
those fellows are.

965
01:58:28,734 --> 01:58:31,278
Pam, would you put it on my butt?

966
01:58:31,404 --> 01:58:35,950
Next contestant now is
number 114, Norman Tucker.

967
01:58:39,120 --> 01:58:42,206
All right, now, Norman had
a 75 on the first round.

968
01:58:42,331 --> 01:58:45,668
Let's see what he can do
on this one. You ready, Norman?

969
01:58:45,793 --> 01:58:47,837
Hit him, Sam!

970
01:58:58,806 --> 01:59:03,311
All right. Nice ride
by Norman Tucker there.

971
01:59:03,436 --> 01:59:05,479
Well, let's get the score.

972
01:59:07,898 --> 01:59:12,570
All right. Waitin' on the score. 77!

973
01:59:12,695 --> 01:59:18,075
So we got a grand total there
of 152 for Norman Tucker.

974
01:59:18,743 --> 01:59:24,540
All right, next rider up
is JR Fisk, number 144!

975
01:59:36,761 --> 01:59:40,264
Nice try. Sorry,
but no cigar there, JR. All right!

976
01:59:41,891 --> 01:59:45,102
All right, our next contestant:

977
01:59:45,227 --> 01:59:49,690
Wes Hightower, number 106.

978
01:59:55,529 --> 01:59:57,031
Can I use your pad?

979
01:59:57,156 --> 02:00:02,620
Wes had a fine score of 81
on the first go-round.

980
02:00:02,745 --> 02:00:04,789
All right.

981
02:00:07,416 --> 02:00:09,627
Are you ready, Wes? Hit him, Sam.

982
02:00:26,811 --> 02:00:28,854
A fine ride by Wes Hightower.

983
02:00:32,191 --> 02:00:34,652
Let's take a look at Wes's score there.

984
02:00:35,695 --> 02:00:37,697
An 80! All right! All right!

985
02:00:37,822 --> 02:00:43,869
An 80 combined with an 81 gives
Wes Hightower a grand total of 161,

986
02:00:43,995 --> 02:00:46,664
and that's the highest score
for this evening.

987
02:00:46,789 --> 02:00:51,210
All right. We're down now
to our next and final contestant:

988
02:00:51,335 --> 02:00:54,630
Bud Davis, number 87!

989
02:01:02,805 --> 02:01:06,350
Bud had a 79 on his first go-round.
Are you ready, Bud?

990
02:01:30,166 --> 02:01:31,417
All right!

991
02:01:31,542 --> 02:01:35,087
A super ride by Bud Davis, number 87.

992
02:01:37,381 --> 02:01:39,550
Enjoy that, Bud?

993
02:01:39,675 --> 02:01:42,845
All right. Now let's take a look
at that score there!

994
02:01:42,970 --> 02:01:45,014
An 83!

995
02:01:46,891 --> 02:01:50,144
An 83 combined with a 79

996
02:01:50,269 --> 02:01:55,191
gives Bud Davis a grand total of 162!

997
02:01:55,316 --> 02:01:59,278
And that makes Bud Davis
the winner of the $5,000!

998
02:02:45,700 --> 02:02:48,369
Pack your things.
We're leaving right now.

999
02:02:48,494 --> 02:02:50,538
I ain't going to Mexico.

1000
02:02:52,832 --> 02:02:56,377
-Sissy, pack your things.
-I ain't going tonight, Wes.

1001
02:02:58,421 --> 02:03:00,464
-Pack it!
-No.

1002
02:03:02,049 --> 02:03:04,093
Pack that shit!

1003
02:03:46,218 --> 02:03:49,055
Leave the motor running.
I'll be right back.

1004
02:03:50,806 --> 02:03:53,976
Welcome! Good to have all you folks
at Gilley's annual rodeo.

1005
02:03:54,101 --> 02:03:58,731
At this time I would like to announce
the winners of all three big events.

1006
02:04:06,197 --> 02:04:10,701
First of all, I want to introduce
the judges of our dance contest.

1007
02:04:10,826 --> 02:04:12,870
Becky Tiller and the top DJ...

1008
02:04:12,995 --> 02:04:14,997
Do you think Sissy left?

1009
02:04:16,082 --> 02:04:19,335
I know she did.
She went out the side door.

1010
02:04:19,460 --> 02:04:22,046
Shit! I wanted her to see this.

1011
02:04:22,171 --> 02:04:24,840
That would have been perfect. Perfect.

1012
02:04:29,971 --> 02:04:33,724
The punching-bag event,
the strong man of the bunch:

1013
02:04:33,849 --> 02:04:36,143
Norman Tucker!

1014
02:04:42,358 --> 02:04:44,610
Congratulations, Norman!

1015
02:04:46,070 --> 02:04:47,905
Now for the really big event.

1016
02:04:48,030 --> 02:04:51,075
The gentleman that outrode
everybody on our famous bull,

1017
02:04:51,200 --> 02:04:54,287
the one and only... Bud Davis!

1018
02:05:05,047 --> 02:05:07,091
Congratulations to Bud!

1019
02:05:09,552 --> 02:05:11,304
Back to that good country music.

1020
02:05:11,429 --> 02:05:15,891
The Charlie Daniels Band,
"The Orange Blossom Special"!

1021
02:05:16,017 --> 02:05:19,270
We'd better go. I don't wanna leave
Aunt Corene alone too long.

1022
02:05:19,395 --> 02:05:21,689
-You did it for her, didn't you?
-What?

1023
02:05:21,814 --> 02:05:24,358
Practicing. Winning. All that.

1024
02:05:24,483 --> 02:05:27,111
-Didn't you?
-What are you talkin' about?

1025
02:05:27,236 --> 02:05:29,196
Cos you sure didn't do it for me.

1026
02:05:32,825 --> 02:05:35,911
Pam, this ain't no time
to start this with me.

1027
02:05:36,037 --> 02:05:38,039
What are you talkin' about?

1028
02:05:38,164 --> 02:05:41,917
Look, I'm a shit.
But I'm not that big a shit.

1029
02:05:42,043 --> 02:05:44,086
I have to tell you something.

1030
02:05:44,211 --> 02:05:48,424
Remember when you came back and
the trailer was clean, flowers around?

1031
02:05:48,549 --> 02:05:50,384
-Yep.
-I didn't do that.

1032
02:05:50,509 --> 02:05:52,803
Sissy did it. She was there.

1033
02:05:52,928 --> 02:05:55,222
She left you a note
asking you to phone her.

1034
02:05:55,348 --> 02:05:58,976
But I tore it up
cos I was sort of jealous.

1035
02:05:59,894 --> 02:06:02,396
I wanted to keep my cowboy.

1036
02:06:03,439 --> 02:06:07,109
You don't love me, Bud.
And I don't really love you.

1037
02:06:07,234 --> 02:06:09,278
Not like that.

1038
02:06:09,862 --> 02:06:12,114
So you shouldn't let her get away.

1039
02:06:15,368 --> 02:06:17,411
But I tell you what.

1040
02:06:18,496 --> 02:06:22,208
If you ever wanna make her jealous,
you know where I am.

1041
02:06:22,333 --> 02:06:23,918
I gotta go.

1042
02:06:53,322 --> 02:06:55,157
Sissy!

1043
02:07:26,147 --> 02:07:28,190
Sissy?

1044
02:07:29,317 --> 02:07:31,861
Get outta here, Bud. I mean it!

1045
02:07:32,403 --> 02:07:35,448
-I gotta talk to you.
-Wes is in Gilley's and we're leavin'.

1046
02:07:35,573 --> 02:07:39,577
I know you're leavin',
but I just wanted to tell you somethin'.

1047
02:07:41,787 --> 02:07:45,291
I'm hard-headed, and I'm prideful.

1048
02:07:46,375 --> 02:07:50,546
And I wanna apologize clear back to
when I hit you the first time.

1049
02:07:53,132 --> 02:07:55,176
I love you, Sissy.

1050
02:08:01,432 --> 02:08:03,476
I love you, too, Bud!

1051
02:08:05,019 --> 02:08:07,063
You do?

1052
02:08:08,606 --> 02:08:10,983
I didn't know you came
to the trailer that day.

1053
02:08:11,108 --> 02:08:15,279
If I'd known that, I'd have called you.
But she tore up that note.

1054
02:08:17,531 --> 02:08:21,744
-Shit, you can ride that bull anytime.
-I don't wanna ride it!

1055
02:08:21,869 --> 02:08:25,706
And screw Mexico because
we can do anythin' we want! I got...

1056
02:08:26,749 --> 02:08:29,293
-What happened to your face?
-I got hit.

1057
02:08:29,418 --> 02:08:31,462
Did he hit you?

1058
02:08:32,421 --> 02:08:35,257
Goddamn, I'm gonna kill
that son of a bitch!

1059
02:08:35,383 --> 02:08:38,219
Bud, just leave him alone! Bud!

1060
02:08:58,572 --> 02:09:01,367
Wes, what's goin' on? Shit.

1061
02:09:35,401 --> 02:09:38,446
All right! Check that office!

1062
02:09:39,280 --> 02:09:42,158
Peter, pick up the money here,
would you?

1063
02:09:42,283 --> 02:09:44,952
-Sam, the door's locked!
-Good job, Bud!

1064
02:09:49,040 --> 02:09:52,877
Bud, I swear I didn't know
about any of that. I swear.

1065
02:10:01,636 --> 02:10:05,139
-Keep that gun on him, Steve.
-See what he did with the keys?

1066
02:10:05,264 --> 02:10:07,975
-He threw them in the garbage can.
-I know where you live.

1067
02:10:08,601 --> 02:10:10,603
Hey, Bud, you put it
on his ass pretty good!

1068
02:10:10,728 --> 02:10:13,648
Y'all get back in the club.
It's all over with.

1069
02:10:15,274 --> 02:10:17,777
Let's go! Get back in the club.

1070
02:10:17,902 --> 02:10:23,199
-Come on, Bud. I'll buy you a beer.
-No way! We're goin' home. Come on.

1071
02:10:35,878 --> 02:10:37,922
Hey! You sure?

1072
02:10:39,131 --> 02:10:42,635
-Hell, I'll buy you two beers!
-Jessie, take care of my car, OK?

1073
02:10:42,760 --> 02:10:44,804
Don't worry about it, Sissy!

1074
02:11:38,899 --> 02:11:40,735
Damn!
