00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:10,957
It's so cold.
No news from your husband?

10
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:15,035
Your parents and your sister
are in Korea?

11
00:02:15,918 --> 00:02:19,069
They must be back by now.

12
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:23,917
They don't know my new address.

13
00:02:23,998 --> 00:02:25,875
It's a shame.

14
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:29,917
There's nobody to protect you.

15
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:34,069
And my son suffers from tuberculosis.

16
00:02:36,038 --> 00:02:38,950
I'm in a big mess.

17
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:42,995
I want to sell all this.

18
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:46,948
Summer clothes.

19
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:50,876
It's not worth much.

20
00:02:56,118 --> 00:02:58,916
I'll take them for 600 yen.

21
00:02:58,998 --> 00:03:01,034
A little more, please.

22
00:03:01,918 --> 00:03:03,909
It's already too much,

23
00:03:03,998 --> 00:03:06,068
summer clothes are hard to sell.

24
00:03:06,918 --> 00:03:09,113
Business isn't getting any better.

25
00:03:09,998 --> 00:03:13,035
Taxes are increasing.

26
00:03:13,078 --> 00:03:16,866
I'll soon have to hang myself
with those old clothes.

27
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,870
Give me another 50 yen.

28
00:03:19,998 --> 00:03:20,987
No way!

29
00:03:21,078 --> 00:03:22,955
Help me.

30
00:03:23,038 --> 00:03:26,997
Just to buy eggs
for the little one.

31
00:03:27,918 --> 00:03:32,992
Try somewhere else.
You won't get more.

32
00:03:33,998 --> 00:03:35,033
Here, 600 yen.

33
00:03:38,078 --> 00:03:41,070
I have a proposition

34
00:03:41,918 --> 00:03:45,991
if you want to make some money.

35
00:03:46,118 --> 00:03:48,916
What proposition?

36
00:03:49,078 --> 00:03:53,993
A well paid job.

37
00:03:54,078 --> 00:03:59,869
I'd do anything.

38
00:04:00,078 --> 00:04:03,912
There are people
with a lot of money.

39
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:07,030
I could introduce you to them.

40
00:04:07,918 --> 00:04:09,033
Will I earn some money?

41
00:04:09,118 --> 00:04:12,076
It depends on you.

42
00:04:12,918 --> 00:04:15,068
You can bewitch them.

43
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:19,033
Don't make fun of me.

44
00:04:19,078 --> 00:04:22,991
It's not much.
Many women do it.

45
00:04:23,118 --> 00:04:26,906
Don't propose this kind of things
to everybody...

46
00:05:03,078 --> 00:05:05,911
How much did she give you?

47
00:05:06,078 --> 00:05:07,875
600 yen.

48
00:05:08,078 --> 00:05:09,955
It's not much.

49
00:05:20,998 --> 00:05:22,989
You're mad at me.

50
00:05:23,958 --> 00:05:26,028
I'd help you if I could.

51
00:05:26,998 --> 00:05:30,070
But I don't earn enough money.

52
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:34,951
That's enough. I'll manage on my
own for the little one.

53
00:05:37,878 --> 00:05:39,072
I bought you some apples.

54
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:44,991
I'll grate them.
I have eggs too.

55
00:05:46,078 --> 00:05:49,866
It's your son,
you must take care of him.

56
00:05:53,078 --> 00:05:57,993
You're blaming me
for drinking too much.

57
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:02,951
The house was burned when
I came back from war.

58
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:09,116
I'm moonlighting,
I can get caught.

59
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:11,027
Despite that...

60
00:06:15,998 --> 00:06:18,114
I still bring 6000 yen a month.

61
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:21,034
It's great.

62
00:06:21,878 --> 00:06:25,996
Tuberculosis isn't so bad.
No need for so many injections.

63
00:06:26,118 --> 00:06:30,111
The doctor pushes you to spend money.

64
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:31,987
It's not true.

65
00:06:32,118 --> 00:06:33,107
They all do that.

66
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,107
We had an X-ray taken.

67
00:06:35,998 --> 00:06:38,034
If anything happens to the baby

68
00:06:38,118 --> 00:06:41,997
my husband will never forgive me.

69
00:06:49,078 --> 00:06:53,868
Any news from my brother?
Is he still alive?

70
00:06:53,998 --> 00:06:55,909
May he come back soon!

71
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:09,113
Your brother-in-law does his best.
Forgive him.

72
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,074
I know.

73
00:07:13,118 --> 00:07:15,074
If the baby was fine

74
00:07:15,878 --> 00:07:20,030
I could work somewhere.

75
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:22,067
Let's stop talking about it.

76
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:37,954
Did you listen to the radio?

77
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:40,029
We don't have one.

78
00:07:40,118 --> 00:07:42,074
They talked about your husband.

79
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:43,993
My husband?

80
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,994
I was listening to the radio earlier.

81
00:07:47,078 --> 00:07:51,913
I heard:
"Kensaku Owada's family

82
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:54,950
"must contact Mr. Hirata

83
00:07:55,078 --> 00:07:59,913
about their son. "

84
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:03,995
Thank you for telling us.

85
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:08,909
Let's go see him now.

86
00:08:09,118 --> 00:08:12,906
Kumiko, can you look after the baby?

87
00:08:13,998 --> 00:08:15,909
I hope he'll be well.

88
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:25,030
He was so sick at the hospital.

89
00:08:26,998 --> 00:08:30,991
He regretted dying after
so many efforts to survive.

90
00:08:43,118 --> 00:08:44,915
This way.

91
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:18,076
I' really sorry to tell you
these sad news.

92
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:20,989
Excuse us.

93
00:09:27,918 --> 00:09:29,988
- What's going on?
- It's the parents.

94
00:09:30,918 --> 00:09:31,873
Good.

95
00:09:32,918 --> 00:09:33,987
It's my boss.

96
00:09:41,918 --> 00:09:43,909
We're sorry to bother you.

97
00:09:44,118 --> 00:09:46,074
It must be disheartening.

98
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:48,067
Sorry.

99
00:09:51,998 --> 00:09:53,113
We're...

100
00:09:54,918 --> 00:09:57,876
deeply affected by this misfortune.

101
00:09:59,878 --> 00:10:02,915
You can come and see me if
you have any problem.

102
00:10:03,918 --> 00:10:04,953
Take heart!

103
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,107
Thank you.

104
00:10:38,878 --> 00:10:41,995
My brother is dead.

105
00:10:44,118 --> 00:10:47,076
Our last hope is gone.

106
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,869
Don't think about it, mom.

107
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,028
We have to take care of the funeral.

108
00:11:21,118 --> 00:11:26,067
Mom, he's suffocating. Look.

109
00:11:26,998 --> 00:11:28,067
What's going on?

110
00:11:28,998 --> 00:11:30,875
I'll get the doctor.

111
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,108
Please.

112
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:38,028
Hurry!

113
00:12:10,038 --> 00:12:11,073
It's time.

114
00:12:13,918 --> 00:12:14,953
I'm leaving.

115
00:12:17,998 --> 00:12:20,068
Fusako!

116
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:23,990
Here, Natsuko!

117
00:12:25,998 --> 00:12:27,067
Sister!

118
00:12:29,918 --> 00:12:33,069
Finally!
I've been looking for you everywhere.

119
00:12:35,998 --> 00:12:38,990
You're very stylish.

120
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:44,028
I'm glad.

121
00:12:45,038 --> 00:12:48,997
It's Kumiko from Owada.

122
00:12:49,998 --> 00:12:51,113
You're a big girl!

123
00:12:52,038 --> 00:12:56,077
Do you remember, Kumiko?
She's my sister who was in Korea.

124
00:12:56,998 --> 00:13:00,035
You changed a lot.
I didn't recognize you.

125
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:03,034
When did you come back?

126
00:13:03,118 --> 00:13:07,873
In september 45.
Your house had burned.

127
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:12,037
Nobody could tell me
where you were.

128
00:13:13,118 --> 00:13:17,111
How are our parents doing?

129
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:23,076
Are they fine?

130
00:13:25,118 --> 00:13:26,995
They're dead.

131
00:13:27,078 --> 00:13:28,067
Dead?

132
00:13:30,998 --> 00:13:32,954
Mother died in Korea.

133
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,916
Father came back with me.

134
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:39,989
Malnutrition.

135
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:50,077
It has been very hard. Painful.

136
00:13:55,038 --> 00:13:59,111
I lost my husband and my child.

137
00:14:01,998 --> 00:14:02,987
Your husband too!

138
00:14:10,038 --> 00:14:12,074
What are you doing now?

139
00:14:14,038 --> 00:14:14,993
I'm a dancer.

140
00:14:15,078 --> 00:14:16,875
It's great.

141
00:14:18,118 --> 00:14:19,107
And you?

142
00:14:19,918 --> 00:14:24,036
I didn't want to cause my
husband's family anymore troubles.

143
00:14:24,918 --> 00:14:27,990
So I left them and I'm working

144
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:30,914
in a company.

145
00:14:31,998 --> 00:14:34,068
She's an executive secretary.

146
00:14:34,918 --> 00:14:37,034
I'd like to leave the factory

147
00:14:38,038 --> 00:14:41,110
to work somewhere else.

148
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:43,107
Where do you live?

149
00:14:43,918 --> 00:14:45,988
In a flat near Tengejaya.

150
00:14:46,918 --> 00:14:48,988
Can I live with you?

151
00:14:49,918 --> 00:14:54,116
I'm living with friends.
We're four in one room.

152
00:15:01,918 --> 00:15:05,957
We never thought we would
meet like that.

153
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:09,913
It's true.

154
00:15:09,998 --> 00:15:12,990
But you, you're still luckier.

155
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,033
Why?

156
00:15:14,118 --> 00:15:16,109
You had a happy youth.

157
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,107
You were married.

158
00:15:18,998 --> 00:15:20,989
We, the youth,

159
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:23,069
won't be able to be happy anymore.

160
00:15:23,118 --> 00:15:25,916
It's necessarily true.

161
00:15:27,118 --> 00:15:30,076
Your clothes are very nice.
Where do they come from?

162
00:15:31,038 --> 00:15:32,915
I had them made here.

163
00:15:32,998 --> 00:15:35,910
It must be expensive.

164
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:37,067
Very.

165
00:15:37,918 --> 00:15:41,069
I haven't finished
paying for them yet.

166
00:15:41,998 --> 00:15:43,954
What if I became a dancer?

167
00:15:44,038 --> 00:15:45,994
Don't be ridiculous.

168
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:52,909
Welcome.

169
00:15:54,038 --> 00:15:54,993
A visit?

170
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:56,067
Come in.

171
00:15:57,918 --> 00:15:59,909
He's our boss.

172
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:03,036
She's my sister I was looking for.

173
00:16:03,918 --> 00:16:05,954
We met by chance.

174
00:16:06,038 --> 00:16:08,916
Like in a dream.

175
00:16:08,998 --> 00:16:11,068
I'm happy for you.

176
00:16:11,918 --> 00:16:14,955
Your sister talked to me about you.
I was worried.

177
00:16:15,038 --> 00:16:16,073
Thank you.

178
00:16:16,118 --> 00:16:19,030
It must have been hard.

179
00:17:11,118 --> 00:17:13,951
If only I could dance...

180
00:17:15,078 --> 00:17:17,990
My clothes aren't so nice.

181
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:22,073
It's time to go back.

182
00:17:22,918 --> 00:17:24,954
I want to stay.

183
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:28,115
Your mother won't be happy
if you come back late.

184
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:31,871
It's wonderful.

185
00:17:47,118 --> 00:17:48,870
Hello.

186
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:10,917
Don't use my cosmetics.

187
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:12,949
Skinflint!

188
00:18:12,998 --> 00:18:16,957
Skinflint yourself!
Why don't you buy some?

189
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,916
I need of this to work.

190
00:18:20,998 --> 00:18:22,954
I don't earn a lot of money.

191
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:26,951
You?
An executive secretary?

192
00:18:28,918 --> 00:18:33,867
Do you have another
contract with him?

193
00:18:34,118 --> 00:18:36,109
Don't be ridiculous.

194
00:18:37,118 --> 00:18:40,952
You should take advantage of it.

195
00:18:41,918 --> 00:18:43,954
It's not my boss' type.

196
00:19:07,118 --> 00:19:11,987
The boat arrives tonight.

197
00:19:12,998 --> 00:19:15,910
We must prepare 3 million.

198
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:18,996
I'm counting on you.

199
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:38,869
We'll get caught.

200
00:19:39,918 --> 00:19:41,909
You're my secretary.

201
00:19:43,998 --> 00:19:44,908
Sir!

202
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:46,994
Do you want me to buy you something?

203
00:19:47,078 --> 00:19:51,993
Do you really care about me?

204
00:19:52,078 --> 00:19:53,955
Of course.

205
00:19:54,118 --> 00:19:55,107
Is it true?

206
00:19:55,918 --> 00:19:57,874
What question!

207
00:19:58,118 --> 00:20:00,951
I'm worried.

208
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:02,869
It's useless.

209
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,916
I'm treating you well.
What else do you want?

210
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:11,996
I'll be even nicer.

211
00:20:38,118 --> 00:20:39,870
Miss!

212
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:41,949
Where is the director?

213
00:20:42,118 --> 00:20:44,029
I don't know.

214
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:47,110
- It worries me.
- Why?

215
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:49,994
I just got a phone call.

216
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:52,067
The police is coming.

217
00:20:52,878 --> 00:20:54,914
- What?
- A search!

218
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:56,947
Damn!

219
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:14,030
We must not keep that here.

220
00:21:14,878 --> 00:21:15,947
I have to stay here.

221
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:18,916
What do you want to do?
Can I help you?

222
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:22,030
Can you hide it somewhere?

223
00:21:22,878 --> 00:21:24,027
I'll take it home.

224
00:21:24,918 --> 00:21:25,953
Thansk a lot.

225
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:27,907
It's heavy.

226
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:29,107
I'll manage.

227
00:21:43,998 --> 00:21:45,067
Miss,

228
00:21:45,918 --> 00:21:47,033
Your coat is trailing on the ground.

229
00:22:39,118 --> 00:22:42,076
Did Natsuko go out?

230
00:22:42,118 --> 00:22:44,916
No, she should be here.

231
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:51,994
Open! Quick!

232
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,954
You? At this hour?

233
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:04,914
What's going on?

234
00:23:06,038 --> 00:23:07,994
There's a police search.

235
00:23:08,118 --> 00:23:11,110
I took it to hide it.

236
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:15,073
Put it somewhere.

237
00:23:20,038 --> 00:23:21,949
Take care of it.

238
00:23:49,918 --> 00:23:51,988
What were you doing, Natsuko?

239
00:23:52,118 --> 00:23:53,995
Nothing special.

240
00:23:54,078 --> 00:23:58,071
Don't lie.
Watch what you're doing.

241
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:05,110
I must take care of you
without her parents.

242
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:08,995
You know it very well.

243
00:24:09,918 --> 00:24:15,868
Some men took advantage
of me on the boat.

244
00:24:20,998 --> 00:24:23,068
I often considered killing myself.

245
00:24:26,118 --> 00:24:30,031
It's the hope of living happily
here that stopped me.

246
00:24:31,878 --> 00:24:34,950
It would have been better
if I had been sold.

247
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:45,029
I could be his mistress.

248
00:24:45,878 --> 00:24:47,072
The director talked to you?

249
00:24:47,918 --> 00:24:52,036
Yes. I'm not a kid anymore,
I can do whatever I want.

250
00:24:56,118 --> 00:24:59,030
Think carefully.

251
00:25:00,918 --> 00:25:01,987
Leave me alone.

252
00:26:05,918 --> 00:26:07,874
Hello.

253
00:26:10,918 --> 00:26:13,034
I was wondering how you were doing.

254
00:26:14,918 --> 00:26:16,954
Did your husband come back?

255
00:26:18,038 --> 00:26:19,073
Unfortunately, no.

256
00:26:19,918 --> 00:26:20,987
I'm sorry.

257
00:26:21,078 --> 00:26:23,956
I'm free to do whatever I want.

258
00:26:29,078 --> 00:26:33,071
It's about what you proposed me.

259
00:26:34,118 --> 00:26:35,995
Are you ready?

260
00:26:52,118 --> 00:26:54,996
She's still not back yet?

261
00:27:00,958 --> 00:27:05,076
I'll check at Owada's.
Maybe she's still there.

262
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:08,915
Where is she hiding?

263
00:27:16,078 --> 00:27:19,991
You never had sex with my sister?

264
00:27:20,958 --> 00:27:23,870
No, never.

265
00:27:24,998 --> 00:27:27,034
So why did she run away?

266
00:27:27,118 --> 00:27:29,109
I don't know.

267
00:27:39,078 --> 00:27:41,069
Maybe it's her.

268
00:27:41,958 --> 00:27:43,027
Hello.

269
00:27:45,918 --> 00:27:48,113
I wanted to check your place.
Is my sister here?

270
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,027
No.

271
00:27:50,958 --> 00:27:52,073
Didn't she come?

272
00:27:52,918 --> 00:27:54,874
What's happening to her?

273
00:27:55,998 --> 00:27:58,876
She doesn't come back home lately.

274
00:28:01,918 --> 00:28:03,067
How do you do?

275
00:28:03,918 --> 00:28:05,067
Make yourself comfortable.

276
00:28:08,918 --> 00:28:09,953
Good bye.

277
00:28:14,998 --> 00:28:17,034
What's going on, Kumiko?

278
00:28:18,118 --> 00:28:20,951
I ran away from home.

279
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:23,996
I quarelled with my brother.

280
00:28:24,118 --> 00:28:26,996
I can manage on my own.

281
00:28:27,078 --> 00:28:28,909
You shouldn't have done that.

282
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:33,076
I stole some money at home.
I'd like to stay here.

283
00:28:33,918 --> 00:28:35,033
It troubles me.

284
00:28:35,118 --> 00:28:39,953
What will I say to your family?

285
00:28:40,958 --> 00:28:43,916
Fine,
I'll find another way.

286
00:28:43,998 --> 00:28:46,068
Where are you going, Kumiko?

287
00:28:46,918 --> 00:28:48,112
Leave me alone!

288
00:29:37,078 --> 00:29:38,955
A hostel?

289
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:41,029
I know a very good hostel.

290
00:29:41,118 --> 00:29:43,074
I'm from Osaka.

291
00:29:43,878 --> 00:29:46,073
I didn't know that.
You're leaving?

292
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:50,030
I have tickets.

293
00:29:51,118 --> 00:29:53,030
I still don't know where to go.

294
00:29:55,118 --> 00:29:56,995
Are you a real student?

295
00:29:57,078 --> 00:29:59,034
Yes...

296
00:29:59,118 --> 00:30:02,997
I must earn money to
pay for my studies.

297
00:30:03,118 --> 00:30:05,074
It must be hard.

298
00:30:05,918 --> 00:30:10,912
You're from Osaka...
You don't know where to go...

299
00:30:11,878 --> 00:30:13,072
Did you run away from home?

300
00:30:13,918 --> 00:30:15,067
More or less.

301
00:30:15,918 --> 00:30:17,909
It's not good.

302
00:30:18,038 --> 00:30:22,953
Tell me everything.
I'm worried.

303
00:30:25,878 --> 00:30:29,917
Forget my job.
Let's have a drink.

304
00:30:51,118 --> 00:30:55,873
I know this place.
Ask anything you want.

305
00:30:56,038 --> 00:30:57,027
All right.

306
00:30:57,118 --> 00:30:59,074
But I don't have money.

307
00:30:59,918 --> 00:31:01,033
I'll pay.

308
00:31:01,078 --> 00:31:02,955
You're inviting me?

309
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:05,108
Two meals of the day!

310
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:08,875
Good booty?

311
00:31:08,998 --> 00:31:11,114
- Promising?
- Not much.

312
00:31:12,118 --> 00:31:15,076
She ran away. She has some cash.

313
00:31:15,118 --> 00:31:17,871
I'll test her later.

314
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:21,916
It's not quiet here.
Come over here.

315
00:31:24,878 --> 00:31:25,993
Just a slut to him.

316
00:31:26,118 --> 00:31:28,951
That's all she is.

317
00:31:36,998 --> 00:31:38,067
Sit down.

318
00:31:40,078 --> 00:31:42,876
It's quiet here.

319
00:31:42,998 --> 00:31:45,034
Something to drink...

320
00:31:45,958 --> 00:31:46,993
I'll taste it.

321
00:31:47,078 --> 00:31:48,909
Do you want some?

322
00:32:05,998 --> 00:32:07,954
The meals are ready.

323
00:32:07,998 --> 00:32:09,033
How much?

324
00:32:09,918 --> 00:32:10,953
200 yens.

325
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:19,950
- We took a beer too.
- Thank you.

326
00:32:27,118 --> 00:32:29,916
I'll keep that for you.

327
00:32:30,918 --> 00:32:34,069
A young stranger and
a lady on the run...

328
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:39,907
meet near the station.

329
00:32:42,998 --> 00:32:44,875
That's romantic.

330
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:46,869
It's true.

331
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:48,869
Take.

332
00:32:49,998 --> 00:32:53,035
Drink. I'll help you.

333
00:32:57,918 --> 00:32:59,909
Don't worry.

334
00:33:03,998 --> 00:33:05,113
One more.

335
00:33:09,998 --> 00:33:11,909
I can't.

336
00:33:35,078 --> 00:33:36,909
I feel dizzy.

337
00:34:33,078 --> 00:34:34,875
Hey!

338
00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:40,993
Kiyoshi!

339
00:34:41,118 --> 00:34:44,076
It's over. Get lost!

340
00:34:48,038 --> 00:34:50,916
Wait! Kiyoshi!

341
00:34:58,118 --> 00:35:00,996
He won't come back.

342
00:35:02,998 --> 00:35:04,909
It's our turn.

343
00:35:04,998 --> 00:35:06,909
Take everything off.

344
00:35:08,038 --> 00:35:09,915
Who are you?

345
00:35:09,998 --> 00:35:11,954
Robbers, isn't it obvious?

346
00:35:12,078 --> 00:35:14,990
Hurry up or we'll hurt you.

347
00:35:29,918 --> 00:35:31,033
Take everything off.

348
00:35:42,118 --> 00:35:44,996
Give her the clogs.

349
00:35:45,958 --> 00:35:46,947
Take that.

350
00:35:47,038 --> 00:35:48,994
Remind yourself that
it's an accident.

351
00:35:49,118 --> 00:35:53,111
I can't go back like that.
Give me my clothes back!

352
00:35:55,918 --> 00:35:59,069
Don't be too demanding.
Stay with us if you want.

353
00:35:59,958 --> 00:36:02,870
You'll have enough to eat.
You'll see Kiyoshi.

354
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:12,954
Are you coming? Hurry up.

355
00:36:42,918 --> 00:36:44,033
Miss Natsuko.

356
00:36:45,158 --> 00:36:49,037
I was wondering if
I should warn you.

357
00:36:49,998 --> 00:36:52,068
- About what?
- Well...

358
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:54,869
Go on! Talk!

359
00:36:54,958 --> 00:36:56,107
I saw your sister.

360
00:36:56,918 --> 00:36:59,034
- Where?
- In Abeno.

361
00:37:00,118 --> 00:37:02,074
In this disreputable district.

362
00:37:10,998 --> 00:37:12,954
How is your business doing?

363
00:37:13,958 --> 00:37:15,073
Safe return!

364
00:37:20,378 --> 00:37:22,334
Don't look at us like that.

365
00:37:44,258 --> 00:37:45,373
Cops!

366
00:37:54,418 --> 00:37:58,297
You're wrong! Let go of me!

367
00:38:45,338 --> 00:38:47,249
Where do you work?

368
00:38:48,338 --> 00:38:50,215
At the Hollywood.

369
00:38:53,418 --> 00:38:55,329
The Hollywood night-club?

370
00:38:57,338 --> 00:38:59,249
Do you have a boss?

371
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:02,296
No, I'm looking for my sister.

372
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:07,170
- A colleague?
- No, my real sister.

373
00:39:07,298 --> 00:39:08,413
Really?

374
00:39:11,418 --> 00:39:14,455
Anyway, you were walking
in the district.

375
00:39:32,258 --> 00:39:34,294
Such a sudden police raid!

376
00:39:34,378 --> 00:39:38,291
I saw the security patrol go by.

377
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:42,297
I asked for a light.

378
00:39:42,378 --> 00:39:46,166
They said that I'd find some at the
police station and I got picked up.

379
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:48,214
You're inattentive.

380
00:39:53,258 --> 00:39:55,408
We don't see you often.

381
00:39:56,298 --> 00:39:59,176
You must salute us.

382
00:39:59,418 --> 00:40:01,374
If you don't...

383
00:40:03,848 --> 00:40:06,726
You won't find customers outside.

384
00:40:08,808 --> 00:40:10,799
I'm not like you.

385
00:40:12,888 --> 00:40:14,799
You're hurting me.

386
00:40:23,728 --> 00:40:24,797
My name is Natsuko.

387
00:40:24,928 --> 00:40:26,680
I'm sorry.

388
00:40:26,728 --> 00:40:29,686
You should have said it sooner.
Your bed is here.

389
00:40:57,648 --> 00:40:58,763
Fusako!

390
00:41:00,808 --> 00:41:02,639
Why are you here?

391
00:41:02,728 --> 00:41:04,798
It's a mistake.

392
00:41:04,928 --> 00:41:07,886
As soon as I learned what
you were doing,

393
00:41:08,688 --> 00:41:10,679
I went looking for you.

394
00:41:11,808 --> 00:41:13,764
Why did you do that?

395
00:41:14,768 --> 00:41:17,726
If it was for money
I could have helped you.

396
00:41:17,848 --> 00:41:20,760
You should have talked to me.

397
00:41:22,648 --> 00:41:23,842
You're my only sister.

398
00:41:26,648 --> 00:41:29,640
Shut up.
You know very well why.

399
00:41:29,808 --> 00:41:33,801
How dare you talk to me like that
after making love with my lover?

400
00:41:38,688 --> 00:41:39,757
I hate you,

401
00:41:40,768 --> 00:41:42,679
but I hate this man even more.

402
00:41:42,808 --> 00:41:46,801
I'll get revenge by
contaminating all men.

403
00:41:56,808 --> 00:42:00,687
Is it true that you've been
brought here by mistake?

404
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:09,804
Nothing I can do. You can't leave
until you've taken the test.

405
00:42:20,768 --> 00:42:22,759
You probably didn't sleep
during the whole night.

406
00:42:24,848 --> 00:42:26,759
Rest a little.

407
00:42:51,928 --> 00:42:56,843
So, what did they say?
You're fine, aren't you?

408
00:43:01,808 --> 00:43:02,877
Doctor!

409
00:43:12,728 --> 00:43:14,719
A white flower

410
00:43:14,808 --> 00:43:19,723
can bloom inside a coal mine.

411
00:43:20,768 --> 00:43:23,805
If those girls had a pure spirit

412
00:43:23,888 --> 00:43:27,847
they wouldn't deteriorate like that.

413
00:43:28,888 --> 00:43:32,642
We blame society for
anything wrong,

414
00:43:32,768 --> 00:43:35,680
but the problem is within
each individual.

415
00:43:35,888 --> 00:43:38,686
We must put an end to this trade

416
00:43:38,728 --> 00:43:41,686
to stop this spirit from spreading.

417
00:43:43,688 --> 00:43:47,886
Our association will carry
on with its goal everywhere.

418
00:43:49,808 --> 00:43:50,877
Sorry, Madam.

419
00:43:56,848 --> 00:43:59,760
Doctor, it's about
Natsuko Kimishima.

420
00:43:59,848 --> 00:44:00,883
I'm listening.

421
00:44:01,808 --> 00:44:04,720
She's my sister.

422
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,764
She told me.

423
00:44:07,648 --> 00:44:08,683
Good.

424
00:44:08,808 --> 00:44:10,685
Is she sick?

425
00:44:10,808 --> 00:44:15,643
She has syphilis.
Also, she's pregnant.

426
00:44:15,768 --> 00:44:16,837
Pregnant?

427
00:44:17,728 --> 00:44:19,684
Take good care of her.

428
00:44:20,848 --> 00:44:24,761
I understand your principle.

429
00:44:24,888 --> 00:44:28,722
But we can't solve everything
with principles.

430
00:44:29,848 --> 00:44:32,806
Like this girl's case.

431
00:44:33,888 --> 00:44:39,804
Yes, she's Kuriyama's child.
I didn't realize.

432
00:44:40,808 --> 00:44:42,764
My periods aren't regular,

433
00:44:43,688 --> 00:44:46,646
I thought my sickness
was due to alcohol.

434
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:51,765
My situation doesn't allow
me to have a baby.

435
00:44:53,848 --> 00:44:56,806
But I've changed since I'm pregnant.

436
00:44:58,848 --> 00:45:03,638
The doctor said that
I could be cured.

437
00:45:05,688 --> 00:45:06,837
I'm carrying a child.

438
00:45:06,888 --> 00:45:10,847
Stupid! Why do you want to have
a child from such a scumbag?

439
00:45:11,728 --> 00:45:13,684
The child is innocent.

440
00:45:14,808 --> 00:45:17,766
I could leave if someone
would vouch for me.

441
00:45:17,848 --> 00:45:19,839
I'll call Kuriyama.

442
00:45:20,768 --> 00:45:25,683
Let's leave together.
He'll vouch for you too.

443
00:45:26,728 --> 00:45:29,720
Go back alone if you want.

444
00:46:10,728 --> 00:46:12,764
- Fusako!
- Are you here?

445
00:46:12,888 --> 00:46:15,686
- Are you all right?
- As usual.

446
00:46:15,768 --> 00:46:17,679
Cigarettes?

447
00:46:17,768 --> 00:46:20,646
No, give them to the others.

448
00:46:20,808 --> 00:46:23,880
- Do you want to shoot up?
- No.

449
00:46:24,768 --> 00:46:26,724
Tell me what you want.

450
00:46:27,688 --> 00:46:28,757
Thank you.

451
00:46:28,848 --> 00:46:30,804
I don't need anything.

452
00:46:33,888 --> 00:46:37,767
How is it going?

453
00:46:38,688 --> 00:46:40,804
Not good at all.

454
00:46:41,888 --> 00:46:46,678
I'll starve if it
doesn't get better.

455
00:46:50,848 --> 00:46:53,726
Do you have children?

456
00:46:54,848 --> 00:46:58,841
I lost them during the war.

457
00:46:59,728 --> 00:47:02,686
My dear... You too!

458
00:47:02,808 --> 00:47:07,836
Why are you talking like that?
You have black thoughts.

459
00:47:08,688 --> 00:47:11,680
Not at all. Idiot!

460
00:47:11,808 --> 00:47:15,687
Don't worry.

461
00:47:16,728 --> 00:47:18,844
Take care. I'll be back.

462
00:47:19,648 --> 00:47:20,683
Thank you.

463
00:49:27,768 --> 00:49:28,803
Kimi Yamada.

464
00:49:35,688 --> 00:49:36,803
Fusako Owada.

465
00:49:37,848 --> 00:49:39,804
She's not here.

466
00:49:39,888 --> 00:49:41,765
She's lucky!

467
00:49:59,848 --> 00:50:01,884
Are you coming?

468
00:50:02,728 --> 00:50:04,844
At this hour?

469
00:50:05,888 --> 00:50:08,846
You don't have the money!

470
00:50:10,848 --> 00:50:12,725
Poor bum!

471
00:50:33,728 --> 00:50:36,686
The cops got up my nose.

472
00:50:45,848 --> 00:50:50,683
Say something.
Ask for my forgiveness at least!

473
00:50:50,808 --> 00:50:52,719
I'm not talking to you anymore.

474
00:50:52,888 --> 00:50:54,719
Why?

475
00:50:57,768 --> 00:50:59,679
I saw my sister.

476
00:51:01,688 --> 00:51:04,646
I know everything.

477
00:51:04,888 --> 00:51:06,799
Aren't you ashamed?

478
00:51:07,848 --> 00:51:09,725
You're kidding!

479
00:51:10,688 --> 00:51:14,806
I took care of her.

480
00:51:16,688 --> 00:51:18,804
I did her a favor.

481
00:51:19,688 --> 00:51:21,883
She should thank me instead.

482
00:51:23,728 --> 00:51:25,684
I took care of two sisters.

483
00:51:25,768 --> 00:51:28,805
You'll never find such a good man.

484
00:51:28,888 --> 00:51:30,879
It's all your fault!

485
00:51:32,768 --> 00:51:35,646
I was ready to support her.

486
00:51:35,888 --> 00:51:40,723
She would have become a whore
without me anyway.

487
00:51:43,728 --> 00:51:45,764
We're not animals.

488
00:51:46,848 --> 00:51:49,681
I can't stand you anymore.

489
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:55,801
Then go away. It's not like
there's a shortage of girls.

490
00:51:57,848 --> 00:51:59,759
I won't leave.

491
00:52:02,848 --> 00:52:04,679
Why?

492
00:52:06,728 --> 00:52:08,719
I must get better.

493
00:52:13,888 --> 00:52:15,685
And...

494
00:52:16,688 --> 00:52:17,723
What?

495
00:52:21,728 --> 00:52:23,639
Speak.

496
00:52:25,848 --> 00:52:27,839
I'm going to have a baby.

497
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:33,679
You're pregnant?

498
00:52:33,768 --> 00:52:34,883
Are you happy?

499
00:52:35,688 --> 00:52:36,803
Have an abortion!

500
00:52:37,648 --> 00:52:39,639
Are you serious?

501
00:52:39,768 --> 00:52:40,837
Of course.

502
00:52:42,848 --> 00:52:47,717
It's better to do it fast.

503
00:52:48,768 --> 00:52:50,679
- No.
- Do it.

504
00:52:50,768 --> 00:52:52,759
No way!

505
00:52:54,848 --> 00:52:57,840
Mr. Kuriyama,
we have the proof

506
00:52:58,768 --> 00:53:00,804
that you're involved
in opium trafficking.

507
00:53:01,688 --> 00:53:02,803
It's not true.

508
00:53:03,808 --> 00:53:06,641
- Here's the warrant.
- There's no proof.

509
00:53:06,728 --> 00:53:10,687
The smartest one
is sometimes wrong.

510
00:53:12,808 --> 00:53:16,767
You'll take at least two years.

511
00:53:18,768 --> 00:53:19,883
Come.

512
00:53:22,848 --> 00:53:24,645
I'm with you.

513
00:53:26,768 --> 00:53:28,838
Is it your wife?

514
00:53:30,688 --> 00:53:32,838
She doesn't know anything.

515
00:53:35,768 --> 00:53:38,840
You'll have to testify.

516
00:53:45,688 --> 00:53:47,679
<i>HOUSE OF LIGHT:</i>

517
00:53:47,768 --> 00:53:50,760
<i>OPEN TO ALL WRETCHED WOMEN</i>

518
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:57,647
Don't let those words tempt you.

519
00:53:58,768 --> 00:53:59,883
What do you know about it?

520
00:54:00,728 --> 00:54:02,639
I have a friend

521
00:54:04,768 --> 00:54:07,680
who ran away from the house.

522
00:54:08,848 --> 00:54:12,682
She lived there,
the owner was nice.

523
00:54:12,808 --> 00:54:16,881
She was properly fed.

524
00:54:17,848 --> 00:54:19,759
It's great.

525
00:54:21,688 --> 00:54:24,725
But her job was supervised...

526
00:54:29,768 --> 00:54:31,645
Do you want to go?

527
00:54:31,728 --> 00:54:33,878
I was just looking.

528
00:54:35,728 --> 00:54:38,800
It's worth it when we're very sick.

529
00:54:39,728 --> 00:54:40,797
It's free.

530
00:54:41,768 --> 00:54:43,838
You can leave if you've had enough.

531
00:54:44,688 --> 00:54:46,883
You don't look so good.

532
00:54:48,848 --> 00:54:53,797
I heard that you don't stop.
Don't destroy your health.

533
00:54:54,808 --> 00:54:58,687
Mind your own business.

534
00:54:59,888 --> 00:55:01,844
I'm ready to die.

535
00:55:27,648 --> 00:55:28,717
Oh, it's you.

536
00:55:28,808 --> 00:55:30,844
- Hello.
- How do you do?

537
00:55:32,768 --> 00:55:33,837
Is Natsuko here?

538
00:55:34,688 --> 00:55:36,758
Yes, but...

539
00:55:36,888 --> 00:55:37,843
What's wrong?

540
00:55:38,688 --> 00:55:40,724
Mr. Kuriyama has been arrested.

541
00:55:41,888 --> 00:55:46,678
She's broke. She can't work
in her current condition.

542
00:55:47,688 --> 00:55:49,679
So what?

543
00:55:49,808 --> 00:55:53,847
She's desperate. She spends most
of her time drinking with men.

544
00:56:22,888 --> 00:56:26,847
Fusako, Do you feel well?

545
00:56:27,728 --> 00:56:28,763
I learned everything.

546
00:56:28,888 --> 00:56:33,678
I can't bear it any longer.
Teach me your job.

547
00:56:33,768 --> 00:56:35,724
Don't be ridiculous.

548
00:56:35,808 --> 00:56:37,799
Do you want to drink?

549
00:56:38,768 --> 00:56:42,807
Prepare your stuff.
You'll have your child.

550
00:56:42,888 --> 00:56:46,722
- Where are you taking me?
- To a house for women.

551
00:56:46,888 --> 00:56:49,766
I don't like it.

552
00:56:51,848 --> 00:56:54,760
Come with me. Get up!

553
00:56:54,848 --> 00:56:57,760
No, I don't want.

554
00:57:01,768 --> 00:57:05,727
When will I be able to get married?

555
00:57:10,808 --> 00:57:12,764
Get up.

556
00:57:22,888 --> 00:57:24,799
The director is coming.

557
00:57:25,648 --> 00:57:27,639
Hello.

558
00:57:28,888 --> 00:57:30,844
How is the work going?

559
00:57:31,728 --> 00:57:33,798
Everything is fine?

560
00:57:33,848 --> 00:57:35,804
Yes, thank you.

561
00:57:35,888 --> 00:57:41,838
I brought you this present.

562
00:57:42,728 --> 00:57:44,764
Thank you, it's nice.

563
00:57:44,808 --> 00:57:47,686
What is it?

564
00:57:47,768 --> 00:57:50,760
Potatoes.

565
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:53,838
You like potatoes.

566
00:57:54,688 --> 00:57:56,679
It's very good.

567
00:57:58,648 --> 00:58:01,720
Do you feel good? Isn't it better
than in the hospital?

568
00:58:01,808 --> 00:58:03,764
It's boring here.

569
00:58:03,848 --> 00:58:05,804
Don't say that.

570
00:58:06,688 --> 00:58:10,806
A respectable life seems
boring at first.

571
00:58:11,688 --> 00:58:15,761
But it becomes interesting
once you get into it.

572
00:58:17,808 --> 00:58:19,685
You! How do you do?

573
00:58:19,768 --> 00:58:22,885
Much better...

574
00:58:23,808 --> 00:58:26,686
Thanks to you!

575
00:58:27,768 --> 00:58:30,726
Continue with the consultations.

576
00:58:32,848 --> 00:58:35,760
- Give me a cigarette.
- All right.

577
00:58:38,888 --> 00:58:40,685
Take heart!

578
00:58:41,688 --> 00:58:46,716
You must never let yourself go.

579
00:58:56,848 --> 00:58:58,804
Oh, you're here?

580
00:59:00,688 --> 00:59:02,758
Hello, Mr the Director.

581
00:59:02,848 --> 00:59:05,840
You caused us a lot of troubles.

582
00:59:06,688 --> 00:59:07,803
Forgive me.

583
00:59:08,808 --> 00:59:11,845
- Since when are you here?
- I just arrived.

584
00:59:12,728 --> 00:59:15,800
- I'm happy for you.
- I'm bringing my sister.

585
00:59:16,808 --> 00:59:19,800
- I want her to have her baby here.
- Good idea.

586
00:59:19,888 --> 00:59:25,758
she had some labour pains.
Will she give birth?

587
00:59:28,888 --> 00:59:31,641
Please, I'm counting on you.

588
00:59:38,848 --> 00:59:40,884
Natsuko, pull yourself together.

589
00:59:53,688 --> 00:59:54,803
A bowl! Hot water!

590
00:59:57,728 --> 00:59:59,684
Help me.

591
01:00:01,688 --> 01:00:03,804
She's only 8 months pregnant.
Will it be all right?

592
01:00:03,888 --> 01:00:06,721
The baby wants to get out.

593
01:00:07,808 --> 01:00:11,847
You, stay outside.

594
01:00:30,688 --> 01:00:31,882
Not yet?

595
01:00:34,848 --> 01:00:38,636
You had a child?
How was it?

596
01:00:38,728 --> 01:00:39,683
A great hardship!

597
01:00:39,768 --> 01:00:41,759
You must be happy when it's over...

598
01:00:41,848 --> 01:00:43,804
Yes, when the baby is crying.

599
01:00:43,888 --> 01:00:45,719
Quiet!

600
01:00:48,768 --> 01:00:51,760
Think carefully.

601
01:00:52,888 --> 01:00:57,803
A child is innocent
when he's born.

602
01:00:58,808 --> 01:01:02,847
No matter who the parents are!

603
01:01:04,688 --> 01:01:08,647
Must we degrade such a pure life?

604
01:01:15,768 --> 01:01:19,886
No. Make sure that
it doesn't happen.

605
01:01:20,808 --> 01:01:25,836
Men take advantage of sincere women.

606
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:29,800
I only think about vengeance.

607
01:01:32,848 --> 01:01:37,717
What did you get out of it?
What's left in you?

608
01:01:37,848 --> 01:01:40,885
A wounded and humiliated woman.

609
01:02:02,768 --> 01:02:05,805
It's done. The mother is fine.

610
01:02:16,728 --> 01:02:17,843
And the baby?

611
01:02:18,888 --> 01:02:24,758
She wasn't fully recovered.
Unfortunately!

612
01:02:34,848 --> 01:02:36,804
I'm sorry, Natsuko.

613
01:02:37,688 --> 01:02:41,681
Maybe it's better this way.

614
01:02:42,728 --> 01:02:47,643
A premature child rarely survives.

615
01:02:48,688 --> 01:02:49,882
I'll have a child.

616
01:02:51,688 --> 01:02:55,761
Next time I'll get married
and I'll have a child.

617
01:03:01,808 --> 01:03:03,719
I'll have one.

618
01:03:06,888 --> 01:03:08,719
You're right.

619
01:03:09,768 --> 01:03:13,761
You'll stay here for a while.

620
01:03:15,648 --> 01:03:20,847
You must not give up hope
even tho you've suffered.

621
01:03:23,768 --> 01:03:27,647
You must become new women.

622
01:03:27,888 --> 01:03:32,882
Not only must you
preserve your body,

623
01:03:33,808 --> 01:03:38,836
but you must also help
to build a better world

624
01:03:39,728 --> 01:03:43,801
where everybody will be happy.

625
01:03:49,848 --> 01:03:51,645
Fusako!

626
01:04:07,768 --> 01:04:12,717
Come spend some time with
a nice girl.

627
01:04:18,768 --> 01:04:21,646
Sir, you look happy.

628
01:04:31,888 --> 01:04:33,879
Sir...

629
01:04:40,888 --> 01:04:44,642
Come quickly.
There's a new girl

630
01:04:44,848 --> 01:04:47,726
- Where is she?
- Near the waste ground.

631
01:04:48,808 --> 01:04:50,799
Fusako! Come quickly!

632
01:04:51,688 --> 01:04:54,725
- Where to?
- To the waste ground over there.

633
01:05:15,848 --> 01:05:17,804
What are you doing?

634
01:05:47,688 --> 01:05:50,839
Where do you come from?
Show yourself.

635
01:05:58,688 --> 01:05:59,757
You!

636
01:06:03,888 --> 01:06:05,765
What's going on?

637
01:06:05,848 --> 01:06:08,840
Nothing. Leave me.

638
01:06:14,768 --> 01:06:18,727
I learned that you ran away
from the house.

639
01:06:18,888 --> 01:06:20,765
It's not good.

640
01:06:20,888 --> 01:06:22,719
I'll go with you.

641
01:06:24,888 --> 01:06:26,799
What about you?

642
01:06:27,848 --> 01:06:30,726
You're the leader
of the whores now?

643
01:06:30,888 --> 01:06:32,765
Leave me!

644
01:06:32,848 --> 01:06:35,681
I'm enjoying my youth.

645
01:06:37,688 --> 01:06:40,760
I've suffered enough already
to be accepted

646
01:06:41,888 --> 01:06:43,799
in your clan.

647
01:06:46,808 --> 01:06:50,767
I spent days at the police station.

648
01:06:51,688 --> 01:06:53,644
Then come!

649
01:06:58,728 --> 01:07:02,880
Do you want to live in this hell?

650
01:07:05,808 --> 01:07:06,877
Come, come over here.

651
01:07:11,808 --> 01:07:16,677
Get sick, lose your sight.

652
01:07:20,848 --> 01:07:24,761
Have your heart and bones rot!

653
01:07:30,808 --> 01:07:33,641
Give birth to a monster.

654
01:07:35,728 --> 01:07:40,722
Destroy all men and women of Japan.

655
01:07:55,728 --> 01:07:57,764
Stupid! Imbecile!

656
01:09:09,808 --> 01:09:10,877
Let's go!

657
01:09:27,888 --> 01:09:29,844
Where are you going Fusako?

658
01:09:31,688 --> 01:09:33,679
You want to leave us?

659
01:09:34,888 --> 01:09:37,641
We'll give you a farewell present.

660
01:09:43,688 --> 01:09:47,727
All right!
Hit me, beat me up.

661
01:09:48,848 --> 01:09:50,804
I've had enough.

662
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:55,839
Aren't you tired of it?

663
01:09:58,808 --> 01:10:00,639
My dear!

664
01:10:06,688 --> 01:10:10,886
Women must not be like that anymore.

665
01:10:11,728 --> 01:10:12,638
What?

666
01:10:12,888 --> 01:10:15,800
Let's go, help me!

667
01:10:56,808 --> 01:10:58,764
Stop! That's enough!

668
01:11:10,848 --> 01:11:15,638
What's the use of torturing her?

669
01:11:15,808 --> 01:11:20,882
What she said makes us sick.

670
01:11:21,728 --> 01:11:22,843
Let her go.

671
01:11:35,808 --> 01:11:38,641
Go away Fusako.

672
01:11:39,688 --> 01:11:41,679
Don't ever come back.

673
01:11:42,728 --> 01:11:44,798
Have a respectable life.
