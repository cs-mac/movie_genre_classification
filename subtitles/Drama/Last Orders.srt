1
00:00:56,189 --> 00:01:00,182
"If I am fancy-free
And love to wander

2
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:05,894
"It's just the gypsy in my soul"

3
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:16,571
"If I am fancy-free
And love to wander

4
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:20,109
"It's just the gypsy in my soul"

5
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:37,152
'Bye, Lenny. You look nice.

6
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:41,363
Don't go near the barrow.

7
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:43,900
Lenny, leave it.

8
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:46,869
I'll do it. Your clothes.

9
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:50,008
Put your coat on.

10
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,749
See you whenever, lads.

11
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:00,911
-See you, Dad.
-Take it easy, Dad.

12
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,489
Here, Vic, don't forget this.

13
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,121
'Bye, Kath.

14
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:37,679
I'm sorry, Vince.

15
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:42,292
Leave it out.
I'm doing you a favor, Dad, ain't I?

16
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:44,660
Don't work here anymore, remember?

17
00:02:48,801 --> 00:02:50,598
Won't be the same, will it?

18
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,096
Won't be the same.

19
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,840
You ain't seen the last of him yet, Bern.

20
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:58,702
You what?

21
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:01,645
I said, you ain't seen the last of Jack yet.

22
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,644
'Course, Ray.

23
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:22,994
It's on me, Lenny.

24
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:24,161
Pint?

25
00:03:24,804 --> 00:03:26,499
This is a turn-up.

26
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:28,006
New timetable, is it?

27
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:29,336
'Morning, Bern.

28
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:31,800
Retired now, are we, Lenny?

29
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,837
No, I'm past the age for it, ain't I?
Not like Raysy here, man of leisure.

30
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:38,543
Fruit and veg trade needs me.

31
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,017
But not today?

32
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:48,016
You haven't told him?

33
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:49,958
No.

34
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,256
So, we're going to Tucker's, yeah?

35
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,199
-No, Vic's coming here.
-Eh?

36
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,500
Vic's coming here. With Jack.

37
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,468
Drink up.

38
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:14,517
'Morning. Fresh out.

39
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:19,887
Is that it? Is that him?

40
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,051
That's him.

41
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:23,391
-What are we drinking?
-What's inside?

42
00:04:23,796 --> 00:04:25,263
What do you think?

43
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:31,701
Mine's a whisky. I think it's a whisky day.

44
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,296
I mean, he's not just in a box, is he?

45
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:37,468
No, Lenny, he's not just in a box.

46
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:42,844
Here you go.

47
00:04:44,517 --> 00:04:46,678
Doesn't seem possible, does it?

48
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,950
-lt's heavy, isn't it?
-Packed solid.

49
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:54,618
Is this just him? I mean, is this all of him?

50
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,019
Where's Bernie got to?

51
00:04:57,096 --> 00:04:59,963
Jesus, Lucky,
and they reckoned you was pint-sized.

52
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,195
Bern?

53
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,902
What's that?

54
00:05:09,108 --> 00:05:11,099
It's Jack. Jack's ashes.

55
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,776
-That's Jack?
-Yeah.

56
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:19,147
Jesus God, what's he doing here?

57
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:20,708
Last orders, Bernie.

58
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:25,420
-Not like the ones you're used to, eh?
-Yeah, you know what they are.

59
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,657
Didn't anyone tell you, Bern?

60
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:31,754
Jack wanted to go to Margate.
Be scattered in the sea.

61
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:36,526
So we thought we should have
a last look-in at the Coach.

62
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:39,195
I see.

63
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:43,398
Get me a large scotch, Bernie,
and one for yourself.

64
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:46,234
I will. Thanks, Vic.

65
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,547
No, no.

66
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:52,014
It's on the house.

67
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:53,916
-On the house.
-Cheers, cheers.

68
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:55,977
-lt ain't every day, is it?
-No.

69
00:05:59,325 --> 00:06:01,555
Yeah, Jesus God.

70
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:06,225
To think he was just sitting there,
six weeks ago.

71
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,658
Well, here's to him.

72
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,331
Jack.

73
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:17,342
Right, lads, whose shout?

74
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,373
As if you didn't know.

75
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:21,941
Just testing.

76
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:24,744
You blokes would die of thirst without me,
wouldn't you?

77
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,375
Same again, Bernie.

78
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,244
Here, look at the form on this one.

79
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:30,482
Cheers, darling.

80
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:33,286
Don't you go coming on to us.
We're all married men here.

81
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:36,157
-Some of us happily.
-Speak for yourself.

82
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,289
Come on, Gunner.
Where would you be without your Joaney?

83
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:41,697
"Always pissed and always late."

84
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:45,464
No, where would any of us be
without our better halves?

85
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,004
All right, darling?

86
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:52,010
Listen,
if you fancy little fellas like Lucky here...

87
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,979
...that is a different matter.
There is no Mrs. Raysy.

88
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:56,674
You'd be doing us all a favor.

89
00:06:56,749 --> 00:06:59,616
He's been on his own too long.
Got set in his ways.

90
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,577
All right, Raysy, all right.

91
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,747
I think you could be
in there with a show, Luck?

92
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:12,624
Well....

93
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:16,658
Point taken, Bernie.

94
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,601
Not much good for business, is it?

95
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,172
Not doing yours any favors either, Vic.

96
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,075
Here's to you, Vic.

97
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,842
You did a really good job on Thursday.

98
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,277
Yeah, the funeral went a treat, Vic.

99
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:31,373
-Don't mention it.
-Yeah.

100
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:33,747
How's Amy?

101
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,446
Managing.

102
00:07:35,688 --> 00:07:38,054
-She ain't changed her mind about coming?
-No.

103
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,024
She'll be with June as usual.

104
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:42,960
Her decision, ain't it?

105
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:44,223
Oh, yeah.

106
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:00,571
Hi.

107
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:06,914
-I'm going upstairs.
-Right.

108
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,610
All we need now is our chauffeur.

109
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,713
Well, they're playing his song.

110
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,915
Wonder what he'll bring.
Seems to drive...

111
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,482
...a different car every week,
as far as I can see.

112
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,084
Same again all round?

113
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:51,689
That'll be him. That'll be Vincey.

114
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:53,765
Ain't he coming in?

115
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:56,959
No, I think young Master Dodds
wants us out there.

116
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:01,300
Jesus Christ.

117
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,568
It's a Merc.

118
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:04,470
Trust Big Boy.

119
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:06,644
Jesus, it's a Merc.

120
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:10,607
I just wanted to do Jack proud.
You know, give him a treat.

121
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:13,675
This has been stuck in my showroom
for the past week, anyhow.

122
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:17,018
I just thought the old man, Jack,
should get the best.

123
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:22,256
I mean, look at it.
Goes along as sweet as a nut, doesn't it?

124
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:25,161
About as sweet as your aftershave,
Big Boy.

125
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:29,660
Don't put a dent in it!

126
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:33,596
-Don't want to lose you a sale, do we?
-All right, relax, Lenny.

127
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,866
What do you do
when you're out in the hearse, Vic?

128
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,674
When you're going on a motorway?

129
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,010
-You step on it.
-Don't encourage him, Vic.

130
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:46,347
A hearse is different. Everyone makes way
for a hearse, don't they?

131
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,979
You mean they don't make way
for Vince here?

132
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,219
Busman's holiday, Vic?

133
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,084
Oh, babe.

134
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:24,517
Where's my kiss then?

135
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,923
No, you got to throw a bucket of water
over them first, Jack.

136
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:29,517
It's young love.

137
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:32,592
Mandy, how about a kiss for me, darling?

138
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:36,024
'Course, Jack. Come here then.

139
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:39,734
Come on, let the dog see the rabbit here.

140
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,433
And get out of here.
Take this clown with you.

141
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,972
I'm sorry, chaps. I've got to bail out.

142
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:48,842
Because needs must.

143
00:10:49,915 --> 00:10:52,076
Well, you ain't 40 every day, are you, Jack?

144
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,415
Only comes once, eh, Lenny?

145
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,087
Come on then, birthday boy.

146
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,487
-You want a promise.
-Yeah, give us a minute.

147
00:10:58,557 --> 00:11:01,754
Happy birthday, Son. Good to see you.

148
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:04,991
'Night, chaps.

149
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,062
'Night, Jack.

150
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,637
-Last orders.
-Coach is leaving.

151
00:11:16,809 --> 00:11:18,174
You dropped some money.

152
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:20,940
-Last orders.
-But it ain't going anywhere as usual.

153
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,844
Never does, does it?

154
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,777
-What are you on about, Raysy?
-Here. Come here.

155
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:29,014
Well, I'm saying
it's the Coach & Horses, but...

156
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:32,580
...it's never gone anywhere, has it?

157
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:40,192
Still ain't a car built yet
that can beat a jam, is there, Big Boy?

158
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:44,459
Did Amy say why she ain't going and all?

159
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:47,333
Makes no difference, does it?
Jack's none the wiser.

160
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:51,467
I told Amy, if she wanted to scatter
the ashes in the cemetery garden...

161
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:53,574
...he'd be none the wiser, either.

162
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:56,547
-You an undertaker!
-You shouldn't judge.

163
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:59,918
-Ashes is ashes.
-And best to do things prompt.

164
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:03,477
-And wishes is wishes.
-How do we know he'll be none the wiser?

165
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,626
Not that I would have been such a fool
as to make such a wish myself.

166
00:12:07,693 --> 00:12:09,718
Well, it weren't that specific.

167
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,529
What wasn't specific?

168
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:13,895
What he wrote. About his wishes.

169
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,600
He didn't say that Amy had to do it,
he just said what he wanted done.

170
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,035
Well, how do you know that?

171
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:21,173
"To whom it may concern.

172
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:22,731
"To whom it may concern.

173
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,977
"Last orders.

174
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,812
"...and my ashes taken forthwith...."

175
00:12:31,784 --> 00:12:34,480
This is all a bit formal for old Jack, ain't it?

176
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:37,879
"From the end of Margate pier"?

177
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:39,884
Margate?

178
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,125
Suppose he thought he'd get there
in the end. One way or the other.

179
00:12:44,196 --> 00:12:45,720
When did he write it?

180
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,757
It was a couple of days before.

181
00:12:48,901 --> 00:12:50,766
Well, why didn't he just tell you?

182
00:12:50,836 --> 00:12:53,430
I suppose he thought
that I'd think he was joking.

183
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,667
I mean that way he makes it proper.

184
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:01,478
Well, if you want to do it, Amy,
I'll take you.

185
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:04,414
-What, in the old camper?
-Yeah, 'course.

186
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,544
No.

187
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:09,919
I can't do it, Ray.

188
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,817
I mean, thank you, but...

189
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:15,526
...I don't want to.

190
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:18,229
It's a dying man's request, Amy.

191
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:20,522
Would you do it, Ray?

192
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:24,330
That way it gets done, doesn't it?
That way his last wish gets carried out.

193
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:26,997
It only says,
"To whom it may concern" anyway.

194
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,336
All right, I'll do it.

195
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:32,900
Yeah, 'course I'll do it. What about Vince?

196
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:37,241
I haven't told Vincey. Not about this.

197
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,147
Well, I mean, I will, but...

198
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,218
...maybe you and him could....

199
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,977
I'll talk to Vince.

200
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:47,283
And maybe Lenny and Vic
will want to go as well.

201
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:51,392
It's not even like his writing, is it?

202
00:13:52,031 --> 00:13:53,589
Moment's come, Ray.

203
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,862
Time to sell up the shop.

204
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,403
Well, there's more to life than bacon,
ain't there?

205
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,597
It's only fair on Amy.

206
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:05,041
I never made my mind up till about,
well, five minutes ago.

207
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,203
I was swabbing down those trays.

208
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,212
You know what today is?

209
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,322
June's 50th birthday.

210
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:23,918
June 1, 1939.

211
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,890
And it's Amy's day for seeing her.

212
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,333
She asked me to go, of course.

213
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:33,167
Well, she never said nothing,
but I knew what she was thinking.

214
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,569
Fifty years is special or it ain't.

215
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:38,976
So, you know, I said to her:

216
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:42,113
"I'll close up early
and I'll see you down there."

217
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:45,039
I mean, I wasn't saying anything definite...

218
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:48,052
...but it was still like a promise.

219
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,984
But when the time came...

220
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,354
...a couple of hours ago...

221
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:56,517
-...I couldn't change.
-Yeah.

222
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:58,828
Not like that.

223
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:02,467
So, I thought I could change
in another way.

224
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:06,302
I can tell her something.
Something to compensate.

225
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:09,369
I can tell her I'm packing it in.

226
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:11,966
Look who it ain't.

227
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:16,573
-lt's Mr. Rest In Peace.
-At your disposal.

228
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:19,578
-Business slow?
-By no means lively.

229
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,883
-No lodgers?
-Just the one. We going down the Coach?

230
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,116
I hope so. There's something to celebrate.

231
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,857
-What's that?
-Guess.

232
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,121
No, you can't say that.

233
00:15:29,194 --> 00:15:31,128
I've got to tell Amy first.

234
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,198
When he told me,
he looked at me as if I'd be dead chuffed...

235
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:37,793
...as if he wasn't looking at the woman
he'd been looking at for 50 years.

236
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,532
See what I'm saying, girl? I'm jacking it in.

237
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,537
You get it? Jacking it in?

238
00:15:44,643 --> 00:15:48,010
I thought maybe we'd get a bungalow
by the seaside.

239
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:51,249
Margate, maybe.

240
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:54,343
<i>Margate, where it all went wrong.</i>

241
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:58,545
<i>Because he couldn't stand that</i>
<i>his daughter, that our June, wasn't normal.</i>

242
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:00,950
-Margate.
-Yeah, Margate.

243
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,389
Yeah, well, what about June?

244
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,761
That's my point. If I can give up
being Jack Dodds, family butcher...

245
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:10,097
...you can give up going on
this fool's errand every week.

246
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:12,802
<i>Fool's errand.</i>

247
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:16,439
That's what he called it, "Fool's errand."

248
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:20,878
So we were going to be--

249
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:23,312
New people. Happy days.

250
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:25,380
New people.

251
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,153
In Margate?

252
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,953
I don't think we could've done it.
Not when you totted it all up.

253
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:38,258
Not when you took away
what he owed on the shop.

254
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:43,528
We would've been a fair bit short.
Don't know where that leaves me.

255
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:46,764
-How much short, Amy?
-lt's about £20,000.

256
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,583
Next stop, Fairfax Park.

257
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:03,588
Fairfax Park.

258
00:17:31,283 --> 00:17:33,285
<i>...13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.</i>
<i>Stop, stop, stop.</i>

259
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:35,651
<i>...13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.</i>
<i>Stop, stop, stop.</i>

260
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:38,216
<i>This is getting very silly.</i>

261
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,430
Hello, June.

262
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:51,764
<i>Well, it doesn't look like</i>
<i>a serious sort of shoe to me.</i>

263
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:55,704
<i>I'm sure there are lots of things</i>
<i>one can use one's shoe for.</i>

264
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:03,810
<i>I can think of one.</i>

265
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:05,506
<i>Can you, Charlie?</i>

266
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,280
Amy's seeing June.
It's her day for seeing June.

267
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:09,945
She could leave one day off.

268
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:13,082
I mean, it's not like it's a normal day,
is it, really?

269
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:16,954
Raysy here is a mine
of information, isn't he?

270
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:19,930
It's like the horses.
Have to prise it out of him these days.

271
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,865
Is that getting heavy, Vic?
You want me to take it for a bit?

272
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,665
-No, it's fine, Ray.
-But even then he gives you duff tips.

273
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:27,967
Here, last tip I gave came good.

274
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:30,238
Well, it weren't for any of us.

275
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:31,606
Who, Raysy?

276
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,768
That'd be telling, wouldn't it?

277
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,743
<i>And the whole world thought</i>
<i>that Jack Dodds...</i>

278
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:41,009
...had finally seen the light...

279
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,614
...and decided to start a new life.

280
00:18:43,889 --> 00:18:44,022
What the world didn't know...

281
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:45,785
What the world didn't know...

282
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:49,984
...was that I'd taken out a loan
to save the shop, five years ago.

283
00:18:51,897 --> 00:18:53,990
And it comes up. In a month.

284
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,931
That wouldn't be a problem.
I sell the house, I sell the shop...

285
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:03,531
...I buy a small tin-pot bungalow in
Margate and scrape by on the remainder.

286
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,106
Except that's all off now, isn't it?

287
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,450
All bets are off, aren't they?

288
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:16,887
How much?

289
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:22,324
Well, it was seven large when I took it on...

290
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,857
-...but now they want £20,000.
-You're joking?

291
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:29,332
No, we're not talking bank managers,
you know, here.

292
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:32,504
It's a special loan. Private loan.

293
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:34,362
Not Vince?

294
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,643
No, no.

295
00:19:40,078 --> 00:19:42,603
Vince wouldn't lend me money
if I was dying.

296
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:46,013
Well, if you can't see
what is right under your nose....

297
00:19:46,084 --> 00:19:48,814
There's a new supermarket
just down the road...

298
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,388
...and they've offered you first refusal
to be their new meat manager.

299
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:54,982
-You've got no choice, have you?
-Haven't I?

300
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,528
Well, that's down to you, Dad.
That's your funeral.

301
00:19:57,596 --> 00:20:00,827
Don't come running back to me.
Don't expect me to lay out any money.

302
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:02,389
At least I'd be my own man.

303
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:04,268
Your own man?

304
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:10,137
You never was your own man.
You was your old man's man, weren't you?

305
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:12,601
That cuts both ways, doesn't it?

306
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:14,471
That should have been our shop.

307
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:18,073
Dad, just don't expect me to bail you out.

308
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:20,750
I ain't got it.

309
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:25,189
Bit of a dry argument over here, Jack.
Wouldn't be your shout, would it?

310
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:38,933
There's a tenner.

311
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:43,100
Buy your mates a drink, a couple of drinks.
Buy yourself one. I'm going home.

312
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,436
So who?

313
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:49,108
Some of Vince's pals from the old days.

314
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:51,941
Business pals.

315
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,285
Rough stuff. Understand?

316
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,822
You look like you're begging
with that bowl there.

317
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:01,389
Yeah.

318
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,196
It's Amy I'm thinking about, Raysy.

319
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:10,227
When l, you know....

320
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:15,202
She might want to stay put or want to
go through with the bungalow anyway.

321
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:17,671
It ain't been kiboshed yet.

322
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,476
She might have other plans.

323
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:27,283
Either way...

324
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:32,747
...I don't want to see a debt collector
knocking at her front door.

325
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:39,495
Hello, Nurse.

326
00:21:39,831 --> 00:21:41,856
Do you know my friend Ray, Kelly?

327
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:43,560
Yeah.

328
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,933
Take his pulse, it's faster than mine.

329
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:50,801
You'd be all right there.

330
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:52,571
You don't change, do you?

331
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,207
I need a winner, Raysy.

332
00:21:58,717 --> 00:22:00,150
I need a winner.

333
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:04,078
I need it
like I've never needed anything before.

334
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:09,887
Here.

335
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:13,620
Feel in there. Get that out.
Yeah, in there. There, look.

336
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:17,593
-What, this?
-Yeah. It's got 1,000 smackers in it.

337
00:22:18,603 --> 00:22:22,369
Eight hundred in fifties,
and the rest in twenties.

338
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:27,036
You got £1,000 in readies
in a place like this? What are you doing?

339
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:29,945
Who's going to nick it in here?
These poor bastards?

340
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:34,450
-Well, where did you get it?
-Well, that'd be telling, wouldn't it?

341
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,384
Open it. Count it.

342
00:22:37,255 --> 00:22:40,418
-No, I trust you.
-No, open it. Open it.

343
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:47,091
It's a thick 'un, Jack.

344
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:49,794
£1,000 to get £20,000.

345
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:52,034
It's a thick 'un.

346
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:55,405
What if I put it on the wrong nag?

347
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:57,235
You can't, can you?

348
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,834
Amy needs it.

349
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:04,078
Think of it...

350
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:06,375
...as buying a camper.

351
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:11,588
£1,000. Remember?

352
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:16,560
You didn't want to sell it to me, did you?

353
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,595
The camper.

354
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:31,433
Can anyone tell me, why Margate?

355
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:34,741
That's where we used to go
on our Sunday outings.

356
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:37,540
Here, Lenny, remember the old meat van?

357
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,979
You think I don't remember, Big Boy?
What with our Sally and all.

358
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:47,592
Yeah, she used to love her Sunday outings
to Margate, while they lasted.

359
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:48,581
<i>Hello, Sally.</i>

360
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:51,754
-See you tonight, Lenny.
-Sal, don't forget your basket.

361
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,730
Sally, behave yourself. Have a good time.

362
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,596
-We'll have a beer, Len.
-Ta-ta, Sally.

363
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:58,227
They are getting like brother and sister,
aren't they?

364
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:01,701
Yeah, one big happy family.
Or so Amy would like to think.

365
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,133
Sally, wave to Mummy. Wave.

366
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:07,110
As if we wouldn't take her to the beach
if we could.

367
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,442
See you, Lenny. Joan.

368
00:24:17,923 --> 00:24:19,220
Poor Lenny.

369
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:23,558
I know what it's like not to be able
to take your daughter to the sea.

370
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,836
<i>Vincey. Sally.</i>

371
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:39,871
Sal, come on, come here.

372
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,071
What is that? What is that?

373
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,844
<i>It's not the same as having your own</i>
<i>daughter there, but it helped.</i>

374
00:24:48,053 --> 00:24:50,112
-There's a swan. See it?
-Yeah.

375
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:52,213
<i>It was good while it lasted.</i>

376
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:56,186
Little Sally got too big though.
Too big for our little meat van.

377
00:25:05,103 --> 00:25:07,663
<i>Vincey's little playmate</i>
<i>was growing up fast.</i>

378
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:10,332
<i>And don't think</i>
<i>that Vincey wasn't noticing.</i>

379
00:25:11,376 --> 00:25:12,866
<i>Little beggar.</i>

380
00:25:15,947 --> 00:25:17,847
<i>No more front seat for Vincey.</i>

381
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:25,045
You got too big, lad.

382
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:40,800
Then Vincey goes and throws up
all over the picnic things.

383
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:52,216
You all right, lad?

384
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:53,983
Come on.

385
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,179
<i>And no more Margate for Sally Tate.</i>

386
00:25:57,322 --> 00:26:01,258
It's a long way from a meat van to a Merc.

387
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:05,055
And this ain't no Sunday outing.

388
00:26:08,967 --> 00:26:11,265
Do you think he was just trying it on?

389
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:13,732
Just to see if we'd do it?

390
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:15,867
So you think he knows.

391
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,377
You think he can still see us, don't you?

392
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:23,537
'Course he can't see us.
He can't see nothing.

393
00:26:25,951 --> 00:26:27,646
Mind you, Big Boy...

394
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:31,951
...if he can't see us, if he can't see nothing,
why did you go and bring a Merc?

395
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:34,248
It's the gesture, Lenny.

396
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:37,318
It's a nice gesture. It's a beautiful car.

397
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:41,223
It ain't no meat van.

398
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:46,836
Margate.

399
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:52,937
Uncle Bert hocked his grandfather clock
so Jack and I could go to Margate.

400
00:26:53,011 --> 00:26:54,273
First time.

401
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:56,746
Margate. For the weekend.

402
00:26:57,015 --> 00:26:59,245
No! Don't ask, all fixed.

403
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:03,552
Just get your old man to give you
the time off. Say it's your honeymoon.

404
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,647
Steamer from Tower Bridge.

405
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:08,954
What do you think?

406
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:12,690
Well, it's easy to believe when you're 18
that you can make a fresh start.

407
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:15,733
The world doesn't have to come to an end
just because....

408
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:23,905
I think I came as close as I ever did
to ditching June then.

409
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:26,876
I wanted to know that...

410
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:29,675
<i>...if he didn't want her,</i>
<i>at least he wanted me.</i>

411
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:36,647
<i>It's where they had their honeymoon.</i>

412
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,118
Margate.

413
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:40,891
That's why.

414
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:43,084
I didn't think they had no honeymoon.

415
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,994
I thought they were saving up
for a pram at the time.

416
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:50,057
Yeah, they had a honeymoon later,
after June was born.

417
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:51,566
Yeah, he's right.

418
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:53,035
Summer of '39.

419
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:55,095
<i>Must have been some honeymoon.</i>

420
00:28:06,384 --> 00:28:10,480
You can pick your chocolate, your china,
or your teddy bear.

421
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:59,061
<i>You'd think they could do something</i>
<i>these days.</i>

422
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:01,537
Think they could come up with something.

423
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:04,239
<i>It was the only time</i>
<i>he ever talked about her.</i>

424
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:08,040
<i>Couldn't face the fact that his daughter</i>
<i>"didn't have all her marbles"...</i>

425
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:09,910
<i>...as he so bluntly put it.</i>

426
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:12,542
I had this idea once...

427
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:15,783
...this stupid idea of being a doctor.

428
00:29:17,956 --> 00:29:19,583
But I ain't, am I?

429
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:23,288
No more than you is
bloody Florence Nightingale.

430
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,121
The best thing we can do, Amy...

431
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:29,530
...is forget all about her.

432
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:32,326
<i>Put her away.</i>

433
00:29:32,637 --> 00:29:34,332
<i>Out of sight, out of mind.</i>

434
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,698
<i>It's what you did then.</i>

435
00:29:39,844 --> 00:29:43,336
And that was where he wanted us
to spend the rest of our days.

436
00:29:45,817 --> 00:29:47,341
Happy days.

437
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,122
<i>Well, June...</i>

438
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,929
...your dad, Jack...

439
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:02,563
...they're scattering his ashes today.

440
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:06,201
In the sea, off the pier,
at Margate of all places.

441
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:12,973
Your brother Vince is going.

442
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:15,542
Uncle Ray. Lenny.

443
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,547
Vic, of course.

444
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,119
Yeah, well...

445
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:27,557
...let them go, June.
The whole bunch of them.

446
00:30:27,625 --> 00:30:30,093
Let them do it without me
and without you.

447
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:35,195
The living come first.

448
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:39,864
Even the living
who were as good as dead to him.

449
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:43,436
There's no more. Here.

450
00:30:44,876 --> 00:30:46,343
Here you go.

451
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:01,721
Jack in a box, eh, Vic?

452
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:05,820
-Do you want to hand him over here, Vic?
-Sorry, Raysy. I was forgetting.

453
00:31:05,897 --> 00:31:07,865
-Do you want to hold him for a bit?
-Yeah.

454
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:18,071
-Are you quite comfy there, Vic?
-Sure am.

455
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:19,439
Good, isn't it?

456
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:22,569
All seats are power adjustable.
Upholstery's all customized.

457
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:25,411
-Yeah, but Vic ain't a customer, is he?
-Who says?

458
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:27,917
-How much you asking, Vince?
-What?

459
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:29,783
Bit of respect, please, Lenny.

460
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:33,119
Well, it's a nice motor, Vic. I mean, it's a...

461
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:37,354
...bit heavy on the petrol,
but 65K on the clock and it's genuine....

462
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,262
Just testing.

463
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:46,162
So when are you going to retire, Vic?

464
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,339
No rush. There's a few customers...

465
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,397
...I shall hang around for yet.

466
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:53,433
Why do you think my name's Vic?

467
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:57,277
-Why is your name Vic?
-Well, I'm halfway to a vicar, ain't I?

468
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:00,547
You could swan it, Vic.

469
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:02,313
Better than Margate.

470
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:05,652
-Big Boy here is aiming for the Bahamas.
-Being a grand a throw.

471
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:07,281
Is that what Jack cost?

472
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:09,690
Bloody hell, Joan had better start saving.

473
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:10,989
That's what I heard.

474
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:14,589
-Very comfy seats these. I could nod off.
-Bloody hell.

475
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,598
Jack.

476
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:19,794
It's me, Vince.

477
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,904
Jack.

478
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:25,833
It's me. Jack.

479
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:30,339
I ain't lost my marbles, Vince.

480
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:33,306
I know it's you.

481
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:37,184
I know it's me.

482
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,790
-Want to swap?
-Nah.

483
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:45,253
Her name's Joy.

484
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:51,326
I bet she can give you bundles of it and all
by the way she looks.

485
00:32:51,402 --> 00:32:53,962
You fell right on your feet in here,
ain't you, Jack?

486
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:56,606
-Here. Come here.
-What?

487
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:58,301
-Sit down.
-Why?

488
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,441
Amy doesn't know what's happening,
does she, Son?

489
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:05,777
No.

490
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:08,748
She doesn't know
whether she's coming or going, eh?

491
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:11,482
She's all right.

492
00:33:12,357 --> 00:33:13,790
She's managing.

493
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:17,491
Oh, Mum.

494
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,021
Come here, come here.

495
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:22,589
Come here. Come here.

496
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,328
It's all right. Come here.

497
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:26,759
She'll manage.

498
00:33:27,872 --> 00:33:29,464
I got the easier part.

499
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:33,939
It don't seem much of a doddle to me.

500
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,806
People panic.

501
00:33:44,655 --> 00:33:47,988
What do you want
to talk to me about, Jack?

502
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:53,720
I want you to lend me some cash.

503
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,760
-Cash?
-Yeah, I need some cash, Son.

504
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:58,597
-You need cash?
-Yeah.

505
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:01,467
-What, you need cash in here?
-Yeah, in here.

506
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:04,705
No, no.

507
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:10,471
I need £1,000.

508
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:12,645
-£1,000?
-Yeah.

509
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:18,488
You need £1,000?

510
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:21,923
Yeah. By Friday, let's say.
And not a dickey-bird.

511
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:25,627
-Yeah, but--
-Don't ask, Vince.

512
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,221
Don't ask.

513
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:30,523
It's a request, Son.

514
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:32,764
Not an order.

515
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:36,606
-Lend?
-Yeah.

516
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:39,700
Well....

517
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:45,607
If Vincey's young Kath can retire, Vic,
I reckon you can, too.

518
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,748
I'll have to think about it.

519
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,152
She didn't retire.

520
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:54,050
She's still working for you at the garage,
is she?

521
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:55,592
It's called a showroom, Lenny.

522
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,185
I'm sorry. Showroom.

523
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:01,293
We all know what's on show, don't we?

524
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:05,663
Nah, she packed it in, didn't she?

525
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,171
<i>Reckon you lost an asset there, Big Boy.</i>

526
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,241
<i>I mean, I think one of her skirts was worth</i>
<i>six of your ties for bringing the punters in.</i>

527
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:19,480
What do you say we all stop somewhere
for lunch? Have a break?

528
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:23,086
Good idea, Vic. Jack would've reckoned
on us having a break for lunch.

529
00:35:23,154 --> 00:35:25,122
Anyway, I hear she ain't out of a job.

530
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:27,885
-You hungry, Lenny?
-No, I'm thirsty.

531
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:32,188
What I hear is that she's pulling in punters
of her own now.

532
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:33,662
Hark who's talking.

533
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:36,666
I've heard your Sally
is taking in paying lodgers, as it were.

534
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:38,964
Is that why the two of you ain't talking?

535
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:43,905
No, the blokes she picks ain't too handy.
They like leaving her in the lurch.

536
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:47,976
Like the one she's married to, who's in jail.
Thanks to you, Big Boy.

537
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:50,605
A hot car's a hot car.
Two wrongs don't make a right.

538
00:35:50,681 --> 00:35:55,345
Yes, and her childhood sweetheart
who buggered off to the Army.

539
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:57,111
<i>Vincey Dodds.</i>

540
00:35:57,722 --> 00:36:00,782
I ain't no Dodds,
and I ain't going to be no butcher's boy.

541
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:07,329
It's easy for men.
They can go and be soldiers.

542
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,126
-Go off to sea.
-Yeah, sure, Sally.

543
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:16,767
So, what are you going to be, Vince?
What do you want to be?

544
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:18,701
Come on, you know, Sal.

545
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,813
-Motors.
-Motors.

546
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:24,608
Yeah.

547
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:30,114
See that '59 Mark IX?

548
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:34,615
It's a start, ain't it?
Ain't any old jam jar, it's a Jag.

549
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:37,818
And I'll make it like new again.

550
00:36:38,496 --> 00:36:42,159
One of these days
Jack will come crawling to me. You'll see.

551
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:48,471
Five years. Vincey signed up for five years.

552
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,972
Couldn't wait to get away.

553
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,509
You can't say he ain't following
in your footsteps.

554
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:54,841
You was a soldier once
as well as a butcher.

555
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,641
I was a butcher by choice.

556
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:59,313
Soldier? Bleeding defaulter, I'd call him.

557
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:01,874
A bleeding deserter,
that's what I'd call him.

558
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:06,788
It's supposed to be "Dodds & Son."
That's what the sign over the shop says.

559
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,018
Wasn't the only reason.

560
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,629
What you think was his reason
wasn't his only reason.

561
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:15,192
You don't own him, Jack.

562
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:18,400
-We don't own them, do we?
-Make sense.

563
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:22,495
We don't own them, do we?
Even when we own them, we don't.

564
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,268
You're talking bollocks.

565
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:27,637
No, the other reason was our Sally.

566
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:31,380
He left her a little leaving present.

567
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:32,641
Sally?

568
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:36,414
-I'd say she's going to have to get rid of it.
-Vincey got her pregnant?

569
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:39,581
So, I reckon I'm going to need
one of your winners, Raysy.

570
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:42,422
Real quick.

571
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:44,321
Sally?

572
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:49,128
I thought they'd finish up together,
Vincey and Sally.

573
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,225
They nearly had to, didn't they?

574
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:56,932
Daughters, who'd have them, Raysy?

575
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:02,479
I reckon you got the right idea,
you know, Vic.

576
00:38:02,546 --> 00:38:05,640
You get yourself a couple of sons,
put them into the firm...

577
00:38:05,716 --> 00:38:07,980
...and then you can bow out easy.

578
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:11,020
-Passing on the torch and all that.
-Can't complain.

579
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:12,747
"Tucker & Sons."

580
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:15,322
Sounds good, don't it, Vince?

581
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:19,288
"Tuckers," that's what we're called
and what we do: we tuck them up.

582
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:21,228
-Don't it, Vince?
-I'm here! I came!

583
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,665
Gents, just remember who's on board.

584
00:38:23,734 --> 00:38:24,962
Okay.

585
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:26,570
<i>Just like your kindness, Ray...</i>

586
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:27,502
<i>Just like your kindness, Ray...</i>

587
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,998
...letting me use the yard
to mess around with motors.

588
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:33,269
Your kindness to an ex-soldier boy.

589
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:38,074
But I can't expect that to go on indef,
can I?

590
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:42,479
I ain't ungrateful, Uncle Ray.

591
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:48,725
So what are you suggesting?
That you pay rent?

592
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:50,485
What with?

593
00:38:50,928 --> 00:38:53,624
I'm talking ownership.
We're talking buying.

594
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:57,000
It's the same question twice over.
What with?

595
00:38:58,102 --> 00:39:01,162
I'm asking you to make an investment,
Raysy, in Dodds Motors.

596
00:39:01,238 --> 00:39:05,231
It don't exist yet, but it will in five years.
You don't have to fork out a penny.

597
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:08,904
You sell me the yard as premises,
you loan me out the asking for five years.

598
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:11,709
Come five years,
I pay your price plus a percentage.

599
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:16,114
If I can't stump up, the yard's yours again.
Plain and simple. You can't lose.

600
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,745
Once I've another car on the go...

601
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:20,256
...and I have the margin,
I'll give you a deposit.

602
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:22,656
You can keep that and all.
Another one?

603
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:25,659
Before we go any further...

604
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,788
...there's one thing.

605
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:30,231
-What's that?
-lt's called a butcher's shop.

606
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:34,601
Yeah, "Dodds and Son."
He ain't still going on about that, is he?

607
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:37,502
His old man put that sign up.

608
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:54,190
I'd want to keep my camper here.

609
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:58,294
I still need my own space for the camper.

610
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:02,160
'Course you can. No charge.

611
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,596
I'll even give it a regular once-over for you.

612
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:09,330
And if you ever want to trade it in,
I'll see you get a good deal.

613
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:13,600
How could you sell him the yard?
Vince is supposed to be working for me.

614
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:17,138
What does it say on the shop?
You've seen the sign?

615
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:19,739
"Next generation. Like father, like son."

616
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:23,583
Don't you think it's time to forget
about that? He's got his own mind.

617
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:26,714
You can't kid yourself no more.
Motors ain't just his hobby.

618
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:30,124
-He's not doing it for the love of it.
-No thanks to Ray.

619
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:33,925
I'm just returning the favor.
Looking after him like you looked after me.

620
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:36,899
He should be cutting up meat,
not mucking about with motors.

621
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:40,903
And in case you haven't noticed,
Vince is your lad, Jack.

622
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,899
Chip off the old block.

623
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,268
Have a drink.

624
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:47,474
<i>"Dodds & Son."</i>

625
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:51,538
That's all Jack ever wanted from Vince.
I mean, even if he had to pretend.

626
00:40:51,715 --> 00:40:53,182
Fathers and sons.

627
00:40:53,884 --> 00:40:56,546
What did you want from June?

628
00:40:58,222 --> 00:40:59,553
Just a sign.

629
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:02,586
Not once in 50 years
did she give me a sign.

630
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:05,356
Not even a flicker that she knew me,
who I was.

631
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:08,359
Fifty years. Every week.

632
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:12,701
-Except for a few weeks, 20 years ago.
-Yeah.

633
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:19,933
We should've had our fights, June and me.
You know, mothers and daughters.

634
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:23,206
Where's the luck, Amy?

635
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:26,774
It's all down to luck.

636
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:32,854
You hear much from your Susie
in Australia these days, Raysy?

637
00:41:35,125 --> 00:41:36,217
Not really.

638
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:38,887
I mean,
do you think she'd come if you was....

639
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:41,559
Do you mean dead, Lenny?

640
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,261
I mean, do you think she'd show up?

641
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:48,233
-What a question.
-lt's a fair one.

642
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:50,570
I've never thought about it.

643
00:41:51,709 --> 00:41:53,336
Australia's a long way.

644
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,540
It's not as far
as from here to the next world.

645
00:41:57,114 --> 00:41:58,479
What next world?

646
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:01,842
It's a manner of speaking, Big Boy.

647
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:04,581
Sydney is further than Sydenham.

648
00:42:04,822 --> 00:42:06,187
That's very clever.

649
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:08,725
Raysy, we'll pop in to Sydenham
on the way back.

650
00:42:08,792 --> 00:42:11,852
Slide round the South Circular,
surprise your ex, Carol.

651
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:13,224
Like we'd be welcome.

652
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:16,528
You think she'd come?
I mean, if it was your....

653
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,526
Funeral, Lenny. The word's "funeral."

654
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:22,671
Only to make sure I was dead.

655
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:44,788
Cup of tea?

656
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:48,764
-Thanks, Dad.
-Turn that down.

657
00:42:50,134 --> 00:42:51,499
Thanks.

658
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:54,197
Nice having you back for a few days.

659
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:57,302
-The trip was great. Andy was great.
-Yeah?

660
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,608
You know he found out where they lived.

661
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:04,143
-Where who lived?
-Andy's family. Back in the past.

662
00:43:04,848 --> 00:43:08,249
-Before they went to Australia.
-Yeah. Nice for you.

663
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,550
You going down to the Coach?

664
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:14,852
Yeah. The Coach ain't coming to me, is it?

665
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:19,260
Yeah.

666
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:27,226
Are you sure about Australia?

667
00:43:28,472 --> 00:43:30,201
Ain't you got a home here?

668
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:34,136
And what about college? And teaching?

669
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:37,943
There's colleges in Australia.
And teachers in Australia.

670
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:40,210
But you don't know nothing
about Australia.

671
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:43,447
I'll find out, won't I? Andy will show me.

672
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,010
Yeah, I bet he will.

673
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:47,853
I could show him the back of my hand.

674
00:43:48,225 --> 00:43:50,716
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

675
00:43:58,369 --> 00:43:59,768
There's your fare.

676
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:05,974
And don't you breathe a word about that.

677
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:11,473
Fifth at Chepstow. Silver Lord.

678
00:44:14,051 --> 00:44:15,746
Came in by half a length.

679
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:21,622
Sue....

680
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:23,916
I know, Dad. I know.

681
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:26,357
Thank you.

682
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:29,428
You're the best dad.

683
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:32,201
And don't you worry, I'll look after Sue.

684
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:38,098
I tell you, I'm feeling really in tune
now that I've been here to England.

685
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,870
You know, tapped into my roots.

686
00:44:39,943 --> 00:44:42,878
I'm feeling so much more together now
because of...

687
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:45,380
...everything, you know, because of Sue.

688
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:48,908
Cheers, Mr. Johnson.

689
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,854
I can't thank you enough.
That was some horse, eh?

690
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:05,292
Good night, everyone.

691
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,839
Carol, listen.

692
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:19,781
If she goes, I don't want to see her
ever again. Understand that?

693
00:45:20,184 --> 00:45:24,484
-Carol, you can't stop her. She's 18.
-And I'm not.

694
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,686
Come here.

695
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:08,956
Come here.

696
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:11,865
I've got something to show you.
Out in the street.

697
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:21,338
Rockabilly. Newmarket. 100-to-8.

698
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,072
What is it?

699
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:26,580
It's a Dormobile.

700
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:29,445
It's a camper van.
A traveling home for two.

701
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,980
As we're a couple again.

702
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:36,416
It's a deluxe model.

703
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:39,920
That's the last straw.

704
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:48,238
<i>I guess she decided she wanted more</i>
<i>out of life than trips in my little camper.</i>

705
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:52,697
<i>But the sub-manager</i>
<i>of a bleeding domestic appliance store...</i>

706
00:46:54,111 --> 00:46:56,739
...Barry bleeding Stokes.

707
00:46:58,749 --> 00:46:59,716
Yeah.

708
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,676
She couldn't tell me to my face.

709
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,249
No, it was over the phone.

710
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:08,189
"Goodbye, Ray."

711
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:11,293
I never said, "Goodbye, Carol."

712
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:12,992
Nah.

713
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:15,925
That was my one cheap comeback.

714
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:20,300
I didn't say goodbye.
I just hung up and sat there not moving...

715
00:47:21,738 --> 00:47:25,105
...not budging till 6:00 in the morning.

716
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:28,606
She got me thinking.

717
00:47:30,214 --> 00:47:31,943
I ought to go and see Sue.

718
00:47:32,916 --> 00:47:34,315
You know?

719
00:47:34,618 --> 00:47:36,381
While I'm still.... Before....

720
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:41,487
Mind you, I haven't spoken to Sue for...

721
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:44,117
...I can't think how many years.

722
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:47,524
You can't blame her for that though.
Not really.

723
00:47:48,398 --> 00:47:51,856
That was more me, I think.
I just stopped writing one day.

724
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:54,870
You know how it is. Things just stop.

725
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:58,064
Then it seems too long to start them again.

726
00:47:59,443 --> 00:48:00,910
So, what....

727
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:04,171
What do you think, Amy?
About going to Australia?

728
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:07,416
Seeing Sue?

729
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,947
It's not too late, is it?

730
00:48:13,023 --> 00:48:15,514
I might have grandchildren.
You never know.

731
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:21,928
-You ain't said yet, Raysy?
-Said what?

732
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:25,096
If you think Sue would show up
to see you off.

733
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:28,429
Yeah, but Australia's a long way.

734
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:32,303
Well, if not Sue, then who?

735
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:37,807
I mean, if you had some special,
daft request like Jack here.

736
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:41,146
-I ain't going to have no daft request.
-But who knows?

737
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:43,852
There's you.

738
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:46,948
You want to think twice about that?

739
00:48:48,058 --> 00:48:51,585
Unless you're thinking of,
you know, planning something sooner.

740
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:55,362
You'll be all right, Raysy. I'll be about.

741
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:58,663
I reckon they should chuck you
over the straight at Epsom.

742
00:48:59,803 --> 00:49:02,431
What about you, Lenny,
where do you want to be chucked?

743
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:06,408
I'm with Raysy. I'm not choosy.
It ain't material.

744
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:09,208
-Ashes is material.
-Yeah, come on, Lenny.

745
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:11,975
-But what about you, Vic?
-That's all arranged.

746
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,446
What's arranged?

747
00:49:13,517 --> 00:49:16,680
I bought a plot years ago for Pam and me
when plots was cheap.

748
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:18,448
Camberwell New Cemetery.

749
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:23,856
-You can go there now, can't you, Raysy?
-Camberwell?

750
00:49:23,927 --> 00:49:27,863
Australia. See Sue. See the grandchildren
you are supposed to have.

751
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:31,526
-What's stopping you? You're a free man.
-He's right, Raysy.

752
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:36,001
I mean, travel a little bit, see the world.
Stop off at Bangkok, spend a few quid.

753
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:38,202
Small matter of the fare, Vic.

754
00:49:38,275 --> 00:49:41,904
Put one of your bets on.
I seem to recall it working before.

755
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:46,041
Yeah. Should be a nice pub
down here, Vic.

756
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:49,350
You know,
for that lunch you was talking about.

757
00:49:57,561 --> 00:50:00,189
"It's just the gypsy in my soul

758
00:50:01,698 --> 00:50:04,929
"If I am fancy-free

759
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:10,667
"Fancy-free"

760
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,378
<i>Doncaster. 15:30. Fancy Free.</i>

761
00:50:27,924 --> 00:50:30,620
<i>33-to-1. Trust me.</i>

762
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:33,089
I trust you, Luck.

763
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:35,655
I've got no choice, have I?

764
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,693
-Here.
-Mr. Dodds, what have you done here?

765
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:41,135
Remember that nurse Kelly
I introduced you to?

766
00:50:41,738 --> 00:50:43,865
-She reckons she fancies you.
-Mr. Dodds.

767
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:46,340
-Would I lie to you, Lucky?
-Come on, come on.

768
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:48,239
-'Bye, Luck.
<i>-'Bye, Jack.</i>

769
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:51,172
-My mate Raysy fancies you.
-Oh, yeah?

770
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:52,270
Yeah.

771
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,645
Got something running in this?

772
00:50:57,721 --> 00:51:00,884
No, as a matter of fact, I haven't.
It's just, you know...

773
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:04,083
...doesn't seem right, what with....

774
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:06,186
Must fancy one or two though.

775
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:08,427
That'd be telling, wouldn't it?

776
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,494
Make the next one a short. Long short.

777
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,895
-ls that all right for you?
-Thank you.

778
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:19,740
Don't you get too excited, do you hear me?
It's a special favor.

779
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:22,574
<i>...into the barrier alongside number five,</i>
<i>Fancy Free...</i>

780
00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:25,342
<i>...the inside runner</i>
<i>in the black and yellow colors.</i>

781
00:51:27,451 --> 00:51:28,418
<i>They're under....</i>

782
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:31,784
-Caning it a bit, ain't we, Raysy?
-Yeah.

783
00:51:32,189 --> 00:51:33,349
<i>And they're off.</i>

784
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:37,792
<i>Out of the barriers together. An even</i>
<i>start. Bunching up quickly over the rail.</i>

785
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:40,159
<i>Saffron Street at the front</i>
<i>by a neck from Katchum.</i>

786
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:41,857
<i>Western Ocean close on their heels.</i>

787
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:45,095
<i>My goodness, Fancy Free hard up</i>
<i>against the back of the field...</i>

788
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:47,430
<i>...clips the heels of Rebellion,</i>
<i>almost tripping.</i>

789
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:49,995
<i>Fights for her footing.</i>
<i>By no means out of the race.</i>

790
00:51:50,073 --> 00:51:52,371
<i>Still looking to make it smooth</i>
<i>in a bunched field.</i>

791
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:53,431
Go on.

792
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:56,946
<i>There's no more than two lengths in it</i>
<i>as they head for the last bend...</i>

793
00:51:57,013 --> 00:51:58,640
<i>...with Saffron Street challenged...</i>

794
00:51:58,715 --> 00:52:00,979
<i>...by Western Ocean,</i>
<i>Katchum and Paco's Boy.</i>

795
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:04,316
<i>Not far behind them Parting Moment,</i>
<i>Victory Art and Rebellion...</i>

796
00:52:04,387 --> 00:52:06,787
<i>...with the rest of the field</i>
<i>dropping back slightly.</i>

797
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:08,620
<i>Falling away at the rear, Fancy Free.</i>

798
00:52:08,692 --> 00:52:10,922
<i>That early stumble</i>
<i>may have cost her dearly.</i>

799
00:52:10,994 --> 00:52:15,294
<i>It's a neck-and-neck battle between</i>
<i>Katchum, Paco's Boy and Saffron Street...</i>

800
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:18,430
<i>...then Parting Moment,</i>
<i>Victory Art and Western Ocean.</i>

801
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:21,130
<i>Then it's Rebellion, followed by....</i>
<i>Wait, what's this?</i>

802
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:23,069
<i>Coming up with a late run, Fancy Free...</i>

803
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,734
<i>...from being out of contention,</i>
<i>is flying into seventh place.</i>

804
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,071
<i>Still a way from the leaders.</i>

805
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:28,133
Go on.

806
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:29,303
<i>Giving all she's got.</i>

807
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:30,471
Do it for Amy.

808
00:52:32,349 --> 00:52:35,341
<i>Fancy Free is gathering in the leaders</i>
<i>as Victory Art and....</i>

809
00:52:35,418 --> 00:52:37,010
Come on, my son, go on.

810
00:52:37,087 --> 00:52:39,248
<i>Fancy Free is pulling back the leaders now.</i>

811
00:52:44,027 --> 00:52:47,087
<i>It's a three-horse race</i>
<i>with Fancy Free looking the stronger.</i>

812
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,928
<i>Fancy Free finds the extra, kicks away.</i>
<i>And clearly....</i>

813
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:50,932
Come on.

814
00:53:00,744 --> 00:53:04,180
<i>Fancy Free, then Paco's Boy,</i>
<i>by half a length from Saffron Street...</i>

815
00:53:04,247 --> 00:53:05,680
<i>...a length from Katchum.</i>

816
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:08,411
<i>What an incredible win</i>
<i>for the outsider Fancy Free!</i>

817
00:53:22,432 --> 00:53:23,831
Somebody's lucky day.

818
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:29,798
Put the mortgage money on that,
treat yourself to a nice long holiday.

819
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:34,700
<i>The official starting price for the winner,</i>
<i>33-to-1, a fitting reward...</i>

820
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:38,646
<i>...for the backers of Fancy Free</i>
<i>for their faith in the long shot which...</i>

821
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:39,704
Yeah.

822
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:41,842
<i>...came in impressively from nowhere...</i>

823
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:43,279
<i>...with a miracle run...</i>

824
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:44,183
It's Amy.

825
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:46,551
<i>...to take out the Doncaster Rémy Martin....</i>

826
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:49,718
Ray?

827
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,119
Jack's....

828
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:57,265
Yeah.

829
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:02,870
Yeah.

830
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:05,472
Okay.

831
00:54:06,943 --> 00:54:08,706
It don't seem right somehow...

832
00:54:11,781 --> 00:54:14,215
...just to leave him here. I mean...

833
00:54:15,485 --> 00:54:19,649
...it don't seem right for us to go
and just leave him here on his own.

834
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:21,651
Alone while we have lunch.

835
00:54:23,126 --> 00:54:24,525
It's up to you, Vince.

836
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:29,955
No, you're right, Ray.
He should come with us, shouldn't he?

837
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:39,966
Coffee. My Mandy said
she needed some coffee.

838
00:54:42,979 --> 00:54:46,608
Mandy doesn't know what a lucky girl
she is, having such a good husband.

839
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:49,117
Mandy knows she's a lucky girl.

840
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:53,818
That's Rochester Castle, yeah.

841
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:58,192
Here you are, you take care of Jack, Raysy.

842
00:54:58,395 --> 00:55:00,920
Three pints of best, please,
gorgeous, and....

843
00:55:00,997 --> 00:55:02,692
Want a drop of scotch, Vic?

844
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:05,792
And a drop of scotch for him, please.
Any grub on the go, babe?

845
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:16,377
-lt's a crying shame that Jack ain't here.
-Yeah, he'd have appreciated it.

846
00:55:17,013 --> 00:55:21,848
-He shouldn't have rushed off like he did.
-No, daft of him. Still, it's a crying shame.

847
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:25,945
If he was here, we wouldn't be, would we?
It's because he's not that we are.

848
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:28,517
-Yeah, all the same.
-Yeah.

849
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:30,584
He'd have appreciated it.

850
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:35,197
And it's because of him that we're here.

851
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,234
I mean, we wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for him.

852
00:55:42,906 --> 00:55:44,669
I'm going to take a leak.

853
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:00,914
<i>-Thanks, darling.</i>
<i>-All right, love.</i>

854
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:01,891
<i>This is Lucky and my fiancée Carol.</i>

855
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:03,153
<i>This is Lucky and my fiancée Carol.</i>

856
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:04,317
My wife Amy.

857
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:05,459
-Pam.
-Vic.

858
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:06,517
Lenny. My wife.

859
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:07,654
-Joan.
-Nice to meet you.

860
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:10,859
If it wasn't for Lucky here,
I wouldn't be here, would l, Lucky?

861
00:56:10,934 --> 00:56:12,765
We call him Lucky, but his real name's....

862
00:56:13,002 --> 00:56:15,027
Ray. Ray Johnson.

863
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:20,241
Jack Dodds.
Small fellows have the advantage.

864
00:56:20,677 --> 00:56:23,703
Small fellows have the luck.
I hope you understand that.

865
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:25,880
Less of a target for the enemy.

866
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:29,179
Less weight to carry around
in this fucking frying pan. Mind you...

867
00:56:29,252 --> 00:56:31,220
...doesn't take away from my advantage.

868
00:56:31,287 --> 00:56:33,812
'Cause I could knock your block off
anytime I like.

869
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:36,222
I hope you understand that.

870
00:56:37,494 --> 00:56:39,257
Hello, Ray.

871
00:56:39,796 --> 00:56:42,560
Hello, Lucky.
How did you get to be so small, anyway?

872
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:46,130
-Did someone shrink you in the wash?
-Yeah, funny.

873
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:48,626
Who'd have believed it?

874
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:51,367
I meet Ray in Egypt,
and he comes from 'round the corner.

875
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:52,933
You never!

876
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:56,075
-You know Valetta Street?
-Yeah.

877
00:56:56,379 --> 00:56:58,574
You know the scrap merchants,
Frank Johnson's?

878
00:56:58,648 --> 00:57:00,240
-Yeah.
-My dad.

879
00:57:00,316 --> 00:57:02,978
-You know Dodds butcher's shop, Spring Road?
-Of course.

880
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:06,112
Bet your ma buys her meat there, eh?
Best bangers in Bermondsey.

881
00:57:17,967 --> 00:57:19,867
Jack, get down!

882
00:57:20,003 --> 00:57:21,994
I owe him my life. Don't l, Lucky?

883
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:24,166
Jack, get down!

884
00:57:25,475 --> 00:57:26,840
Oh, Jesus, Lucky...

885
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:29,274
...if you hadn't have pulled me down...

886
00:57:29,345 --> 00:57:32,143
...l'd have copped that smack
in the wife's best friend.

887
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:34,577
So the wife must be thankful?

888
00:57:35,151 --> 00:57:36,379
I am, Ray.

889
00:57:37,086 --> 00:57:37,916
I am.

890
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:39,883
Least I could do.

891
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:43,324
Least he could do.
Save my bollocks for me.

892
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,228
Excuse my friend, won't you, Carol?

893
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,355
What are the odds?

894
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:51,832
Lucky here is the one to ask about that.
He's got a head for figures.

895
00:57:51,901 --> 00:57:55,462
You shouldn't be going into insurance, Ray.
You should've been a jockey.

896
00:57:55,538 --> 00:57:57,438
Too big for a jockey. Otherwise....

897
00:57:58,374 --> 00:58:01,400
So I've heard, Ray. So I've heard.

898
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:03,506
Oh, yeah?

899
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,178
To Jack.

900
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:06,737
Jack.

901
00:58:09,085 --> 00:58:10,347
Can we have the same again?

902
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:13,821
Not for me, Raysy. Unless you want
to find yourself another driver.

903
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:17,986
I'll have a nice cup of coffee, darling.
And half a Corona.

904
00:58:18,928 --> 00:58:20,987
Oh, yeah, and I'll have a large cognac.

905
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:25,331
Just as well Amy didn't come.
She wouldn't have planned on a piss-up.

906
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:28,594
Is that tea or whisky you're drinking there?

907
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:29,660
Tea.

908
00:58:30,773 --> 00:58:32,741
He wouldn't begrudge us, would he?

909
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:35,400
It's a long way to Margate.

910
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:48,679
<i>I thought:</i>

911
00:58:48,758 --> 00:58:51,625
<i>"You ain't been nowhere,</i>
<i>and you ain't going nowhere."</i>

912
00:58:51,794 --> 00:58:54,092
Yeah, I saw his glove
where his face had been.

913
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:57,189
And I saw stars.
I actually saw them like they say you do.

914
00:58:57,433 --> 00:59:00,163
Isn't it time to pack it in then?
Hang up the gloves.

915
00:59:00,236 --> 00:59:01,567
I could've won 50 smackers.

916
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:04,334
You're seven years older
than when you last fought.

917
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:05,533
Yeah, well.

918
00:59:06,910 --> 00:59:09,970
Gunner Tate,
middleweight, always pissed....

919
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,373
"Always pissed and always late."

920
00:59:23,259 --> 00:59:23,393
-I was wondering, Vince....
-What was you wondering, Vic?

921
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:26,226
-I was wondering, Vince....
-What was you wondering, Vic?

922
00:59:26,529 --> 00:59:30,363
I was wondering if we could pop over
to Chatham. See the war memorial.

923
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:33,265
Yeah, I don't see why not. Do you, Raysy?

924
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:36,028
I'd have thought a man
in your line of business...

925
00:59:36,105 --> 00:59:37,970
...would've had enough of memorials.

926
00:59:38,675 --> 00:59:42,236
Nah, that's why we're here, ain't it?
To remember the dead.

927
00:59:42,612 --> 00:59:45,206
Yeah. That's what we're doing, Vince.

928
00:59:45,982 --> 00:59:48,473
-Mean a detour?
-We can do detours.

929
00:59:51,154 --> 00:59:53,418
It's my round, ain't it? Same again, chaps?

930
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:58,852
Vince, want another coffee?
Something to go with it?

931
01:00:00,396 --> 01:00:02,330
I don't know about you, Lenny...

932
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:06,097
...but I'm driving down to Margate
to deliver something.

933
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:07,830
That's why we're all here.

934
01:00:07,904 --> 01:00:10,896
Vic here wants a little stop on the way,
which I ain't against.

935
01:00:10,974 --> 01:00:13,408
Considering we're here
to remember the dead.

936
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:17,771
It's just gone 14:15.
If you want to sit here all day drinking...

937
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:21,544
...that's your business.
I'm going to the car, then to Margate.

938
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:24,382
So if you ain't coming,
you'd better find a station.

939
01:00:31,194 --> 01:00:32,252
Tosshead.

940
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:36,788
My old dad used to say,
"You don't dilly-dally with the deceased."

941
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:38,122
Shit.

942
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:43,568
Hey!

943
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:47,003
Big Boy!

944
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:51,371
You forgot something, didn't you?

945
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:53,304
You forgot something.

946
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:59,850
You forgot this, didn't you?
You forgot your coffee.

947
01:01:01,190 --> 01:01:03,283
You may think you can do without us...

948
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:06,726
...but you'd look a bloody fool
going to Margate without this.

949
01:01:21,811 --> 01:01:24,302
-He didn't say it was up no bleeding hill.
-Nah.

950
01:01:29,485 --> 01:01:30,713
Hold up, Vic.

951
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:35,123
Come on then!

952
01:01:46,102 --> 01:01:47,433
The old buggers.

953
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:34,808
Exalted company, Vince.

954
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:44,723
<i>They used to think I was bad luck at first.</i>

955
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:46,455
Kept well away.

956
01:02:48,297 --> 01:02:51,061
It weren't long before they realized
how much I was needed.

957
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,194
<i>How important what I did was.</i>

958
01:02:58,274 --> 01:02:59,764
Helped me realize it, too.

959
01:03:01,177 --> 01:03:02,235
Accept it.

960
01:03:04,514 --> 01:03:06,311
Something to be proud of really.

961
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:27,398
Pam.

962
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:29,069
Vic.

963
01:03:29,772 --> 01:03:33,139
So what do you do then, Vic,
when you're not mucking about in boats?

964
01:03:33,676 --> 01:03:35,337
Ships, not boats.

965
01:03:39,549 --> 01:03:42,848
I'm in the undertaking trade.

966
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:46,451
Family business.

967
01:03:47,056 --> 01:03:50,219
Well, I never would have guessed, Vic.

968
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:53,792
You'll never be out of a job then, will you?

969
01:03:56,632 --> 01:03:59,965
So you'll be used to handling bodies then.

970
01:04:03,139 --> 01:04:05,937
-You got yourself a winner here, Vic.
-Yeah, spoils of war.

971
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:07,236
She's a lively one.

972
01:04:14,717 --> 01:04:18,653
-Bleeding hill nearly finished me.
-That's it, I'm packing up smoking.

973
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:31,132
"Heligoland," where the hell's that?

974
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:36,463
"Jutland, Doggerbank."

975
01:04:39,475 --> 01:04:40,806
Fucking Navy.

976
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:52,412
Fucking Army.

977
01:04:52,855 --> 01:04:53,844
Get down!

978
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:06,130
Fucking tourists.

979
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:20,742
<i>I fancy seeing the pyramids.</i>

980
01:05:22,151 --> 01:05:25,086
I fancy seeing the inside
of the nearest knocking shop.

981
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:29,683
Pyramids are tombs, ain't they, Lucky?
Pyramids are for dead people.

982
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:32,455
Whereas, a tart's tackle....

983
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:36,328
A mate gave me that.
Personal recommendation.

984
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:41,134
-Maybe I could just stay here and--
-lt's "Be-kind-to-your-pecker" Day.

985
01:05:43,439 --> 01:05:45,532
-Yeah, maybe it's best if l--
-What's up?

986
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:48,805
-Not so long since you seen the missus?
-I don't have no missus.

987
01:05:48,878 --> 01:05:50,004
Well, so, then?

988
01:05:50,846 --> 01:05:51,835
I have.

989
01:05:56,886 --> 01:05:59,320
Different place, different rules, eh, Ray?

990
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:02,849
Lucky man.

991
01:06:05,061 --> 01:06:07,256
No, that's you, remember?

992
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:09,164
<i>Please, come, come.</i>

993
01:06:09,231 --> 01:06:13,361
Please, look at it. Look at the girls.
Take your pick.

994
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:18,800
Your first choice, Raysy.

995
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:22,277
Just don't pick the one
with the big bristols on the right.

996
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,445
They're laughing, Jack.

997
01:06:25,514 --> 01:06:27,345
What do you want them to do, cry?

998
01:06:30,252 --> 01:06:33,312
Good choice, Lucky. Your size.

999
01:06:36,792 --> 01:06:39,488
Take your pick. Come on, take your pick.

1000
01:06:40,863 --> 01:06:42,524
No. No.

1001
01:06:44,066 --> 01:06:45,863
Oh, no. Jesus.

1002
01:06:47,803 --> 01:06:49,395
Oh, blimey.

1003
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,475
You lick me.

1004
01:06:53,976 --> 01:06:55,000
"Lick"?

1005
01:06:56,112 --> 01:06:58,910
Oh, like. Yeah.

1006
01:06:59,548 --> 01:07:01,709
-Yeah, yeah.
-You've got ten minutes.

1007
01:07:01,784 --> 01:07:02,808
Look at clock.

1008
01:07:03,052 --> 01:07:05,145
What your friend think you go now?

1009
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:07,388
Oh, right. Yeah.

1010
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:10,087
Ray.

1011
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:11,718
Ray Johnson.

1012
01:07:12,628 --> 01:07:13,492
Ray.

1013
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:15,622
How was it?

1014
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:18,895
Madame Yashmak here was just about
to come and prise you two apart.

1015
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:20,265
Very good. Very good.

1016
01:07:20,336 --> 01:07:22,395
Little man, big "cuck."

1017
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:27,765
"Cuck"?

1018
01:07:31,947 --> 01:07:34,381
-Go on then.
-You sure about this, Raysy?

1019
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:37,385
It's all right. I used to drive
the old man's horse and cart.

1020
01:07:37,453 --> 01:07:39,717
But this ain't a horse and cart.
It's a camel.

1021
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:40,721
Trust me.

1022
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:43,657
I trust you, Raysy. I ain't got no choice.

1023
01:07:43,859 --> 01:07:46,487
Second ride of the day, Raysy!

1024
01:08:04,814 --> 01:08:06,247
I'll catch you up.

1025
01:08:06,515 --> 01:08:08,415
You go on, I'll catch you up there.

1026
01:08:09,285 --> 01:08:10,309
Go on.

1027
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:17,290
What's all that about?

1028
01:08:28,904 --> 01:08:29,734
Vincey.

1029
01:08:29,805 --> 01:08:31,033
Let's go, lad.

1030
01:08:35,311 --> 01:08:36,710
Come on, Vincey.

1031
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:44,881
If a butcher can get cost
on what he chucks in his wastage bin...

1032
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:47,514
...and in his fat drawer,
he'd be happy, wouldn't he?

1033
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:48,579
He'd be laughing.

1034
01:08:48,657 --> 01:08:50,488
What you must understand is that...

1035
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:53,619
...what comes into the shop
ain't what goes out of the shop.

1036
01:08:53,829 --> 01:08:55,353
-ls fat wastage?
-Exactly.

1037
01:08:56,265 --> 01:08:59,393
If you take away the weight of the wastage
from what you buy...

1038
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:02,130
...and you divide what's left
into what you paid for it...

1039
01:09:02,204 --> 01:09:03,831
...that'll give you your real cost...

1040
01:09:03,906 --> 01:09:06,773
...which is set against your takings.
Don't forget that...

1041
01:09:06,842 --> 01:09:09,970
...because bone will cost you,
fat and shrinkage will cost you...

1042
01:09:10,045 --> 01:09:12,377
...and not keeping your knife sharp
will cost you.

1043
01:09:12,448 --> 01:09:15,975
You'll end up with measly scraps of meat
that ain't fit to sell to no one.

1044
01:09:16,051 --> 01:09:18,383
And that'll cost you more than anything.

1045
01:09:18,554 --> 01:09:21,284
You got to keep a constant eye
on wastage. Constant.

1046
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:23,455
-lt's all about waste.
-Yeah.

1047
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,289
You're a good boy, Vincey.

1048
01:09:26,595 --> 01:09:27,823
Good boy.

1049
01:09:27,963 --> 01:09:29,089
Vincey.

1050
01:09:29,265 --> 01:09:30,391
Uncle Ray!

1051
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:37,061
This is Uncle Ray's favorite breakfast spot.

1052
01:09:37,306 --> 01:09:39,570
Because he likes hanging 'round real men.

1053
01:09:39,642 --> 01:09:41,200
My secret's out.

1054
01:09:41,277 --> 01:09:43,677
And he also fancies the likes of that.

1055
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:45,871
It's a love from afar, eh, Lucky?

1056
01:09:45,948 --> 01:09:49,349
-What are you looking at, you little rascal?
-Stop him.

1057
01:10:10,306 --> 01:10:13,969
I don't know what you want to be doing
with all this in here.

1058
01:10:16,178 --> 01:10:17,873
You're a good boy, Vince.

1059
01:10:33,262 --> 01:10:34,889
What are you doing there?

1060
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:36,054
Keys.

1061
01:10:36,265 --> 01:10:38,062
Sorry.

1062
01:10:42,972 --> 01:10:44,735
-Raysy.
-What?

1063
01:10:45,874 --> 01:10:46,966
I was wondering.

1064
01:10:47,042 --> 01:10:48,100
-Wondering?
-Yeah.

1065
01:10:48,177 --> 01:10:50,702
Jack never said nothing to you
about no money, did he?

1066
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:52,041
When he was.... Before....

1067
01:10:52,114 --> 01:10:54,514
He didn't say nothing
about no sum of money?

1068
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:56,844
-What sum of money?
-No, it don't matter.

1069
01:10:59,989 --> 01:11:01,957
Say about £1,000.

1070
01:11:02,024 --> 01:11:04,993
No, he never mentioned no money.

1071
01:11:08,697 --> 01:11:10,722
Only we got to see Amy right, ain't we?

1072
01:11:10,799 --> 01:11:11,663
Yes.

1073
01:11:11,734 --> 01:11:14,134
-We got to see Amy right.
-Of course.

1074
01:11:59,381 --> 01:12:00,473
Detour.

1075
01:12:27,076 --> 01:12:29,044
Raysy, where's Jack?

1076
01:12:53,068 --> 01:12:56,196
Jesus, what now?

1077
01:12:56,505 --> 01:12:57,767
Search me.

1078
01:13:04,179 --> 01:13:05,578
<i>Wicks' Farm.</i>

1079
01:13:07,750 --> 01:13:09,809
That's where we first met, Jack and me.

1080
01:13:11,019 --> 01:13:14,386
We weren't much more than kids
scratching for a few shillings.

1081
01:13:14,456 --> 01:13:15,980
<i>Whatever we could get.</i>

1082
01:13:19,795 --> 01:13:21,228
Like picking flowers.

1083
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:24,822
"He loves me. He loves me not.

1084
01:13:25,434 --> 01:13:27,925
"He loves me. He loves me not."

1085
01:13:28,003 --> 01:13:29,971
So what did you come for?

1086
01:13:30,305 --> 01:13:33,365
Need the shillings. Same as everyone.

1087
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:40,774
So what do you do
when you're not picking hops?

1088
01:13:43,285 --> 01:13:45,845
Well, that would be telling now,
wouldn't it?

1089
01:13:46,622 --> 01:13:49,182
Picking up girls is what I remember.

1090
01:13:49,558 --> 01:13:51,287
It was our holiday, weren't it?

1091
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,385
Well, near as we could get.

1092
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:56,459
Felt like it.
Well, something different, weren't it?

1093
01:13:57,232 --> 01:13:58,221
Yeah.

1094
01:13:58,300 --> 01:13:59,927
Music and singing every night.

1095
01:14:00,002 --> 01:14:03,335
Uncles, aunts, cousins....
Pickers from every which where.

1096
01:14:03,472 --> 01:14:04,803
And the gypsies.

1097
01:14:06,575 --> 01:14:08,099
The gypsies.

1098
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:14,244
You can put the spuds on here now.

1099
01:14:14,483 --> 01:14:15,415
Cheryl...

1100
01:14:15,584 --> 01:14:18,712
...quickly, can you go and see
if you can find the children?

1101
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:22,784
I got these from one of Wicks' hands.
You want them?

1102
01:14:23,358 --> 01:14:24,325
Yeah.

1103
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:27,958
If you want to help me top and tail
and string them.

1104
01:14:30,566 --> 01:14:31,965
Yeah, all right.

1105
01:14:37,673 --> 01:14:42,201
-There's a chair in here if you want it.
-No, I'll be all right on the grass.

1106
01:14:49,051 --> 01:14:50,814
Chuck them in here.

1107
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:53,845
See if we can't fill it.

1108
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:39,362
Jack.

1109
01:15:46,808 --> 01:15:47,934
Mummy.

1110
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:57,283
You're beautiful.

1111
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:00,749
Do you know that?

1112
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:04,324
You are beautiful.

1113
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:08,294
It's not what you expect
from a butcher's boy.

1114
01:16:10,198 --> 01:16:12,723
And to know from his smile
that he means it.

1115
01:16:15,237 --> 01:16:16,568
It turns you over.

1116
01:16:19,274 --> 01:16:20,332
Yeah.

1117
01:16:26,281 --> 01:16:27,748
Well, wait here then.

1118
01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:30,442
You can take me for a walk.

1119
01:17:03,852 --> 01:17:05,547
And that was our June.

1120
01:17:13,195 --> 01:17:15,595
This ain't Margate.
It ain't what Jack wanted.

1121
01:17:16,698 --> 01:17:18,165
What's he doing?

1122
01:17:18,934 --> 01:17:20,333
You toerag!

1123
01:17:21,069 --> 01:17:23,594
Last orders have to be respected.

1124
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:25,864
Pillock!

1125
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:32,109
No respect for Jack's wishes ever.

1126
01:17:32,314 --> 01:17:35,977
I mean, he doesn't have any prior claim,
does he?

1127
01:17:36,852 --> 01:17:39,548
I mean, he has no special rights.

1128
01:17:39,621 --> 01:17:42,215
He's not kin, is he? He never was.

1129
01:17:42,891 --> 01:17:44,256
Tosshead!

1130
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:47,386
You fucking toerag. Give me that.

1131
01:17:47,462 --> 01:17:49,589
What are you doing? Get off!

1132
01:17:54,302 --> 01:17:58,932
Always what Vincey wants, eh?
Some son you were, Big Boy.

1133
01:17:59,608 --> 01:18:01,075
Some son.

1134
01:18:01,309 --> 01:18:04,403
There was no love lost, was there?

1135
01:18:05,881 --> 01:18:06,870
Lenny...

1136
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:08,775
...what are you doing?

1137
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:09,646
Come on.

1138
01:18:09,751 --> 01:18:12,982
Too good for your old man?
Too good for all of us?

1139
01:18:13,155 --> 01:18:14,645
That's for Sally.

1140
01:18:14,723 --> 01:18:16,452
And that's for Jack.

1141
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:18,853
Yeah, you....

1142
01:18:20,028 --> 01:18:21,552
Lenny.

1143
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:34,706
Come on, Lenny. Come on.

1144
01:18:37,012 --> 01:18:38,877
Fists. Come on, tosser.

1145
01:18:38,947 --> 01:18:40,244
Fists, you pillock.

1146
01:18:40,649 --> 01:18:41,616
Fists?

1147
01:18:42,084 --> 01:18:44,075
Calm down, Lenny. Calm down.

1148
01:18:48,957 --> 01:18:51,425
Just stop, Lenny.

1149
01:18:53,228 --> 01:18:54,957
Come on. Got you, got you.

1150
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:58,059
-Let me back at him.
-Leave it, Lenny, leave it!

1151
01:19:04,706 --> 01:19:06,697
I wasn't going to throw it all.

1152
01:19:07,642 --> 01:19:09,269
I was only going to throw a bit.

1153
01:19:09,544 --> 01:19:10,875
It was only a bit.

1154
01:19:11,513 --> 01:19:13,242
What are we going to do then?

1155
01:19:13,315 --> 01:19:16,807
Was you going to stop every 10 minutes
so you can chuck a bit?

1156
01:19:16,885 --> 01:19:19,217
You know, handful here, handful there.

1157
01:19:19,287 --> 01:19:23,189
What does scatter mean?
What does the word "scatter" mean?

1158
01:19:23,258 --> 01:19:25,158
What does it fucking mean?

1159
01:19:28,063 --> 01:19:29,963
Should be ashamed of yourself.

1160
01:19:30,065 --> 01:19:31,498
You pillock.

1161
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:35,259
This is where....

1162
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:38,433
This is where....

1163
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:45,639
<i>See down there?</i>

1164
01:19:45,714 --> 01:19:45,947
That's where me and your mum first met.
Hop picking.

1165
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:48,245
That's where me and your mum first met.
Hop picking.

1166
01:19:48,316 --> 01:19:49,715
What's hop picking?

1167
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:52,913
It's what me and your mum did.
What we used to do down there.

1168
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:57,220
They say Kent is the garden of England.

1169
01:19:59,261 --> 01:20:02,389
But it's like you've got to have the country
to have the town.

1170
01:20:02,564 --> 01:20:03,758
See them orchards?

1171
01:20:03,832 --> 01:20:06,528
Uncle Lenny couldn't have
no apples to sell, could he?

1172
01:20:06,601 --> 01:20:08,068
See them sheep?

1173
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,102
Come with me.

1174
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:20,406
You see...

1175
01:20:21,316 --> 01:20:25,184
...with hops, it's not the hops
or how you pick them, it's...

1176
01:20:25,887 --> 01:20:27,320
...who picks them.

1177
01:20:27,722 --> 01:20:29,883
What I'm meaning to say is...

1178
01:20:29,958 --> 01:20:33,621
...it wasn't your mum or me
who picked your hops.

1179
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:37,960
We picked someone else's hops.

1180
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:40,590
Her name's June.

1181
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:42,868
She's your sister.

1182
01:20:44,039 --> 01:20:45,768
You have a sister called June.

1183
01:20:45,841 --> 01:20:47,172
I ain't got a sister.

1184
01:20:47,242 --> 01:20:50,370
-I ain't got a sister.
-Your sister's a loony!

1185
01:20:50,445 --> 01:20:55,246
-Ain't got a sister. Ain't got a sister.
-Sister's a loony! Sister's a loony!

1186
01:20:55,884 --> 01:20:58,352
Where is she? In a nuthouse?

1187
01:21:11,833 --> 01:21:15,166
No, she's in a home.

1188
01:21:16,171 --> 01:21:17,297
But, well...

1189
01:21:18,373 --> 01:21:21,831
...actually, she's not really your sister...

1190
01:21:23,011 --> 01:21:24,569
...she's sort of your sister.

1191
01:21:28,183 --> 01:21:29,514
Because, you see...

1192
01:21:29,651 --> 01:21:32,950
...during the war,
the Jerries sent over these things...

1193
01:21:33,021 --> 01:21:35,114
<i>...and when they ran out of fuel...</i>

1194
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:38,591
...they came down on the house.
They was called doodlebugs.

1195
01:21:39,194 --> 01:21:40,491
"Doodlebug"?

1196
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:43,922
<i>Yeah. A flying bomb.</i>

1197
01:21:44,966 --> 01:21:45,955
<i>A B1...</i>

1198
01:21:46,468 --> 01:21:48,698
<i>...and it flattened the Pritchett's house.</i>

1199
01:21:50,505 --> 01:21:53,804
Killed them all except you.

1200
01:21:54,042 --> 01:21:55,270
It's a baby!

1201
01:21:56,111 --> 01:21:57,601
Is it alive still?

1202
01:21:58,046 --> 01:22:00,606
Amy rescued you. Otherwise....

1203
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:04,081
-Will you take it then?
-Yeah.

1204
01:22:04,152 --> 01:22:05,779
Thanks, love. Right, got it?

1205
01:22:07,956 --> 01:22:09,480
<i>You were born a Pritchett.</i>

1206
01:22:10,859 --> 01:22:14,056
Vincent lan Pritchett.

1207
01:22:18,033 --> 01:22:20,399
I came home from the war
and there you were.

1208
01:22:20,535 --> 01:22:22,093
The son I never knew I had.

1209
01:22:23,905 --> 01:22:26,396
So you're not really my dad?

1210
01:23:24,866 --> 01:23:28,097
I've got a cloth in the car, Lenny.
And a brush.

1211
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:30,231
Here, hold Jack, Raysy.

1212
01:23:31,339 --> 01:23:34,069
Now, we need the Canterbury road.

1213
01:23:34,476 --> 01:23:36,467
Look for signs for Canterbury.

1214
01:23:36,544 --> 01:23:37,875
-A28.
-Yeah.

1215
01:23:38,546 --> 01:23:39,945
Canterbury?

1216
01:23:40,115 --> 01:23:44,142
We might as well call in there as well.
Pop in to the bleeding cathedral.

1217
01:23:44,886 --> 01:23:46,376
No, you're right, Lenny.

1218
01:23:46,454 --> 01:23:49,116
Why shouldn't we take him
'round Canterbury Cathedral?

1219
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:50,919
Jack'd have loved that, wouldn't he?

1220
01:23:50,992 --> 01:23:54,052
Yeah, good idea, Lenny. Nice gesture.
He'd be honored.

1221
01:23:54,129 --> 01:23:57,223
I've never been to Canterbury Cathedral.
Not, you know, inside.

1222
01:23:57,298 --> 01:23:58,230
Nah.

1223
01:23:58,299 --> 01:24:00,665
Canterbury doesn't have a racecourse,
does it?

1224
01:24:28,029 --> 01:24:29,553
Fourteen centuries.

1225
01:24:30,031 --> 01:24:32,829
I mean, I have a think about that,
14 centuries.

1226
01:24:35,437 --> 01:24:37,735
They got kings and queens in here.

1227
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:41,641
Makes me feel humble. My line of work.

1228
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:42,902
Yeah.

1229
01:24:43,878 --> 01:24:45,812
Got saints and cardinals.

1230
01:24:46,714 --> 01:24:49,444
That's where Becket got done.
Up there on them steps.

1231
01:24:49,517 --> 01:24:52,953
"...full-length view
from behind Saint Augustine's chair...

1232
01:24:53,021 --> 01:24:58,186
"...from the thirteenth century, and a copy
of Augustine's original Saxon cathedral...

1233
01:24:58,259 --> 01:25:02,423
"...of sins completed behind the transepts
by William the Englishman."

1234
01:25:03,531 --> 01:25:05,362
Well, this is lovely, isn't it?

1235
01:25:06,534 --> 01:25:09,731
-You all right, Lucky?
-Yeah, give me a mo.

1236
01:25:10,972 --> 01:25:12,997
What, was I rabbiting on, was I?

1237
01:25:13,441 --> 01:25:14,840
No, it's not that.

1238
01:25:15,043 --> 01:25:18,206
Here, take Jack for a bit. I'll catch you up.

1239
01:25:18,279 --> 01:25:20,907
-All right. Sit there and take it easy.
-Yeah.

1240
01:25:20,982 --> 01:25:24,315
Come on. I think the Black Prince
is here somewhere.

1241
01:25:24,486 --> 01:25:26,454
Whatever you say, Big Boy.

1242
01:25:26,521 --> 01:25:30,150
<i>I mean, there's only me to consider now,</i>
<i>ain't there?</i>

1243
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:34,921
Yeah, now all your women have run off
to places named "Syd" something or other.

1244
01:25:34,996 --> 01:25:37,965
Well, with them gone,
I don't need it, do I? So...

1245
01:25:38,032 --> 01:25:40,967
...when Henderson offered me
the promotion, I told him:

1246
01:25:41,035 --> 01:25:43,469
"I don't need a leg up, thanks.

1247
01:25:43,538 --> 01:25:48,237
"I'd prefer two days less work
for a quarter less wages."

1248
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:51,673
-Are you having a cup of tea or not?
-Yeah.

1249
01:25:51,746 --> 01:25:55,773
It's all right for some.
Some of us have to make an honest living.

1250
01:26:01,523 --> 01:26:02,956
All right, darling?

1251
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:06,252
So...

1252
01:26:07,896 --> 01:26:10,057
...l'll have many a free Thursday.

1253
01:26:11,366 --> 01:26:13,527
If ever you want me to drive you.

1254
01:26:14,536 --> 01:26:15,833
To see June.

1255
01:26:16,437 --> 01:26:19,463
Well, that's a long old bus ride
you have to do.

1256
01:26:19,974 --> 01:26:22,340
The Horses can do without me for a day.

1257
01:26:23,344 --> 01:26:26,279
And besides, it's right near Epsom.

1258
01:26:31,386 --> 01:26:33,047
And maybe I could come in.

1259
01:26:35,857 --> 01:26:37,256
And see June.

1260
01:26:44,532 --> 01:26:45,829
Yeah, all right, Ray.

1261
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:47,595
Here you are, hold Jack.

1262
01:26:47,702 --> 01:26:49,067
"Fought at Cressi...."

1263
01:26:49,137 --> 01:26:51,002
He sounds like a proper soldier boy.

1264
01:26:51,105 --> 01:26:55,064
"Married to Joan, the Fair Maid of Kent."

1265
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:58,038
Here, Lenny, look,
someone else got spliced to a Joan.

1266
01:26:58,112 --> 01:27:00,637
Doesn't look like he smiled much, does it?

1267
01:27:01,716 --> 01:27:03,377
"Fought at Cressi...

1268
01:27:03,685 --> 01:27:06,153
"...and Poitiers...."

1269
01:27:07,622 --> 01:27:10,591
Good afternoon, Vic Tucker,
funeral director...

1270
01:27:10,658 --> 01:27:12,250
...for the late Mr. Adams.

1271
01:27:12,327 --> 01:27:13,885
Oh, yes, Mr. Tucker.

1272
01:27:15,330 --> 01:27:16,592
One moment.

1273
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:20,197
Do you have a June Dodds here
by any chance?

1274
01:27:20,969 --> 01:27:23,164
Been with us almost 30 years.

1275
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:27,100
Down there...

1276
01:27:27,408 --> 01:27:29,933
...out the door, third door on the left.

1277
01:27:30,278 --> 01:27:31,267
Thank you.

1278
01:28:09,851 --> 01:28:13,753
Right. I say we take a quick gander
at the cloisters and make a move.

1279
01:28:13,855 --> 01:28:16,415
-Eh, Lenny?
-All right, Big Boy. Lead on.

1280
01:28:30,705 --> 01:28:32,570
<i>"If I am fancy-free</i>

"It's just the gypsy in my soul"

1284
01:28:38,713 --> 01:28:41,876
I met you the same time as I met Jack.
Did you know that?

1285
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:45,582
-What, in the desert?
-Yeah, in the desert. Egypt.

1286
01:28:47,588 --> 01:28:48,953
I saw your photo.

1287
01:28:53,428 --> 01:28:55,692
<i>I knew the first time we actually met.</i>

1288
01:28:56,431 --> 01:28:58,661
In the stationary Coach and Horses?

1289
01:28:59,434 --> 01:29:00,958
-I could tell.
-Yeah?

1290
01:29:01,035 --> 01:29:03,128
Just by the way you looked at me.

1291
01:29:04,372 --> 01:29:06,772
We're not going to see June today, Amy.

1292
01:29:08,309 --> 01:29:10,402
I've packed a picnic in the back.

1293
01:29:14,248 --> 01:29:15,943
Whatever you say, Ray.

1294
01:29:18,753 --> 01:29:20,744
<i>And it's Blackbird leading....</i>

1295
01:29:21,255 --> 01:29:22,950
Can't see which one's ahead.

1296
01:29:24,258 --> 01:29:25,953
Oh, I can't see.

1297
01:29:26,027 --> 01:29:29,827
Come on, Malfi. Come on, Malfi!

1298
01:29:29,897 --> 01:29:31,057
Come on!

1299
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:32,424
Oh, my God!

1300
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:34,058
Come on, Malfi!

1301
01:29:34,135 --> 01:29:36,729
Come on! Go on, Malfi!

1302
01:29:36,804 --> 01:29:40,433
-Come on!
-Oh, my God, I don't believe it!

1303
01:29:41,843 --> 01:29:42,901
She's won!

1304
01:29:47,115 --> 01:29:48,047
Ray!

1305
01:29:49,016 --> 01:29:50,074
We won!

1306
01:29:50,318 --> 01:29:52,377
Come on, picnic time.

1307
01:29:54,655 --> 01:29:57,215
-When do we get the money?
-Honest Harry's over there.

1308
01:29:57,692 --> 01:30:00,525
That was so exciting.
I've never won anything before, Ray.

1309
01:30:00,595 --> 01:30:03,155
Oh, my God.
Come on, get in the van. Quick.

1310
01:30:04,132 --> 01:30:05,463
Come on, in you go.

1311
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:13,739
You took me places.

1312
01:30:15,576 --> 01:30:17,476
I loved traveling about.

1313
01:30:19,046 --> 01:30:20,274
Our picnics.

1314
01:30:23,451 --> 01:30:25,214
It's just like home, isn't it?

1315
01:30:25,286 --> 01:30:26,617
Home from home.

1316
01:30:26,754 --> 01:30:29,655
Ray, you're such a lovely man.

1317
01:30:31,793 --> 01:30:33,488
You're a lucky man.

1318
01:30:34,629 --> 01:30:36,392
You're a little ray of sunshine.

1319
01:30:39,734 --> 01:30:41,326
You're a little ray of hope.

1320
01:31:08,029 --> 01:31:08,961
Here.

1321
01:31:14,368 --> 01:31:16,836
<i>I still cherish those weeks, Ray.</i>

1322
01:31:17,605 --> 01:31:18,936
Six, wasn't it?

1323
01:31:20,041 --> 01:31:21,099
Yeah.

1324
01:31:24,111 --> 01:31:26,045
Was a pity they had to stop, wasn't it?

1325
01:31:26,113 --> 01:31:29,276
-Well, I couldn't not see June, could I?
-No.

1326
01:31:30,017 --> 01:31:32,542
Then with Vincey coming home
from the Army and....

1327
01:31:32,620 --> 01:31:36,283
Yeah. It meant a lot to you,
Vincey coming home.

1328
01:31:36,891 --> 01:31:38,859
And seeing June.

1329
01:31:41,963 --> 01:31:43,624
And we couldn't do it to Jack.

1330
01:31:45,132 --> 01:31:46,258
Could we?

1331
01:31:49,971 --> 01:31:51,438
He loved me, Ray.

1332
01:31:53,207 --> 01:31:55,141
No one else for him, I swear it.

1333
01:31:57,144 --> 01:31:59,704
-So, how was it?
-All right.

1334
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:01,812
<i>Couldn't love June...</i>

1335
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:04,178
<i>...but he did love me.</i>

1336
01:32:08,756 --> 01:32:10,087
You're beautiful, Amy.

1337
01:32:11,659 --> 01:32:13,251
Still beautiful.

1338
01:32:14,996 --> 01:32:18,432
Vince is bloody 40,
and you're still beautiful.

1339
01:32:20,902 --> 01:32:22,995
What do you say I take you dancing?

1340
01:32:23,070 --> 01:32:26,733
-Dancing?
-Yeah, I want to be the envy of one and all.

1341
01:32:29,443 --> 01:32:30,501
Good luck.

1342
01:32:30,578 --> 01:32:32,842
We haven't been dancing in a long while,
have we?

1343
01:32:32,914 --> 01:32:35,883
Well, I don't have enough fingers
and toes to count the years.

1344
01:32:35,950 --> 01:32:37,144
Thirty years.

1345
01:32:44,358 --> 01:32:46,952
-Oh, Jack.
-Come here. Come here.

1346
01:32:51,866 --> 01:32:52,958
You all right?

1347
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:03,942
Butchery Lane?

1348
01:33:04,278 --> 01:33:06,303
Now that's got to be worth a look,
don't it?

1349
01:33:06,380 --> 01:33:08,007
Be bloody rude not to.

1350
01:33:08,082 --> 01:33:11,813
There you are. Thought we'd lost you.

1351
01:33:12,353 --> 01:33:15,288
I think a pint wouldn't hurt, would it?

1352
01:33:22,296 --> 01:33:24,526
<i>Yeah, he's a lovely man, your Uncle Ray.</i>

1353
01:33:27,201 --> 01:33:29,192
Little ray of sunshine.

1354
01:33:33,507 --> 01:33:34,872
Did you miss me, June?

1355
01:33:37,812 --> 01:33:41,248
Did you even know I weren't here
for those six weeks that summer?

1356
01:33:43,117 --> 01:33:45,347
Out of how many in 50 years?

1357
01:33:49,490 --> 01:33:53,187
If you tot up the hours
we've actually spent together...

1358
01:33:56,797 --> 01:33:58,662
...probably only been about a year.

1359
01:34:00,067 --> 01:34:02,331
It's not much
for mother and daughter, is it?

1360
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:08,035
Maybe he was right, Jack.

1361
01:34:10,311 --> 01:34:11,471
Your dad.

1362
01:34:13,414 --> 01:34:14,813
I did choose you.

1363
01:34:17,885 --> 01:34:20,479
He couldn't choose you.
He couldn't choose his own.

1364
01:34:22,690 --> 01:34:25,454
Not even at the end, did he want to know,
"How's June?"

1365
01:34:27,294 --> 01:34:29,421
<i>Not even, "Send June my love."</i>

1366
01:34:34,402 --> 01:34:38,600
<i>You would have loved him though, June.</i>
<i>You would have loved him.</i>

1367
01:34:45,179 --> 01:34:46,942
Still beautiful, Amy.

1368
01:34:52,787 --> 01:34:53,947
Still.

1369
01:35:00,127 --> 01:35:01,424
<i>Journey's end.</i>

1370
01:35:01,962 --> 01:35:05,420
Hallelujah. Gasping for a pee.

1371
01:35:06,701 --> 01:35:08,293
This is Marine Terrace.

1372
01:35:10,137 --> 01:35:14,198
Marine Terrace, Margate. The Golden Mile.

1373
01:35:16,444 --> 01:35:18,435
'Course it's out of season.

1374
01:35:20,614 --> 01:35:22,206
Dreamland's still there.

1375
01:35:39,867 --> 01:35:41,129
Where's the pier?

1376
01:35:41,268 --> 01:35:42,963
You're looking at it, Raysy.

1377
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:47,234
-What, that thing? Well, that ain't a pier.
-Yeah, but they call it the "Pier."

1378
01:35:47,308 --> 01:35:50,368
-No, that's a harbor wall.
-Yeah, but they call it the "Pier."

1379
01:35:50,444 --> 01:35:53,174
There used to be the jetty
that looked like a pier.

1380
01:35:53,247 --> 01:35:54,509
Where the steamboats came in.

1381
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:55,674
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1382
01:35:55,783 --> 01:35:57,410
Well, it sounds reasonable.

1383
01:35:57,485 --> 01:36:00,318
So where's the other thing, the jetty?

1384
01:36:00,387 --> 01:36:02,787
Well, that got swept away in about....

1385
01:36:02,857 --> 01:36:05,621
The storms, 1970, something, yeah.

1386
01:36:05,693 --> 01:36:06,717
Yeah.

1387
01:36:06,794 --> 01:36:11,026
I remember Amy saying,
"Did you hear about Margate Jetty?"

1388
01:36:14,502 --> 01:36:15,560
Yeah.

1389
01:36:28,949 --> 01:36:32,282
-Not good scattering weather.
-Well, that depends how you look at it.

1390
01:36:32,353 --> 01:36:34,344
-Fair old wind.
-Yeah.

1391
01:36:35,689 --> 01:36:37,884
Vic, we don't need the bag now.

1392
01:36:43,697 --> 01:36:45,665
Here, you hold him, Ray.

1393
01:36:48,736 --> 01:36:50,101
Well, where's Lenny?

1394
01:36:50,171 --> 01:36:51,934
Has he gone for a paddle and all?

1395
01:36:52,006 --> 01:36:54,975
Oh, God, look at him.
He ain't even done his trousers up.

1396
01:36:55,442 --> 01:36:56,500
All right?

1397
01:36:56,811 --> 01:36:58,142
Come on.

1398
01:36:58,412 --> 01:36:59,709
He's off.

1399
01:37:04,185 --> 01:37:06,016
Come on, you soppy sod.

1400
01:37:11,692 --> 01:37:14,456
It ain't weather for the beach, I tell you.

1401
01:37:14,695 --> 01:37:16,595
Mad Gunner Tate.

1402
01:37:16,664 --> 01:37:20,760
Mad Jack Dodds. You think he whisked
this up special, do you?

1403
01:37:23,270 --> 01:37:25,465
-Well.
-Well.

1404
01:37:25,906 --> 01:37:27,396
<i>Well, June...</i>

1405
01:37:27,842 --> 01:37:28,409
...they must be there by now.

1406
01:37:28,409 --> 01:37:29,899
...they must be there by now.

1407
01:37:31,212 --> 01:37:32,372
Margate.

1408
01:37:34,014 --> 01:37:35,447
Jack in the sea.

1409
01:37:37,251 --> 01:37:38,684
Or about to be.

1410
01:37:41,889 --> 01:37:43,186
Goodbye, Jack.

1411
01:37:47,695 --> 01:37:48,992
Goodbye, June.

1412
01:37:52,766 --> 01:37:53,858
Oh, June.

1413
01:38:01,442 --> 01:38:03,876
We've got to make our own lives now,
June...

1414
01:38:03,944 --> 01:38:07,072
...without each other.
We've got to go our own separate ways.

1415
01:38:07,748 --> 01:38:09,909
I've got to think of my own future.

1416
01:38:11,151 --> 01:38:14,086
Now 50 years is beyond the call
for bringing up baby.

1417
01:38:18,025 --> 01:38:21,051
Most I've ever wanted,
the most I've ever hoped for...

1418
01:38:21,228 --> 01:38:24,356
...in those 50 years,
I haven't asked for the earth, believe me...

1419
01:38:24,431 --> 01:38:27,423
...is that you should've looked at me
just once and said:

1420
01:38:28,235 --> 01:38:29,259
"Mom."

1421
01:38:33,874 --> 01:38:37,105
I couldn't have just stopped coming
without saying this to your face.

1422
01:38:41,615 --> 01:38:43,082
Goodbye, June.

1423
01:39:19,153 --> 01:39:20,848
<i>If there was anything other than...</i>

1424
01:39:20,921 --> 01:39:22,980
...blind chance in the world...

1425
01:39:23,290 --> 01:39:26,521
...if we could see
and choose in the first place...

1426
01:39:27,428 --> 01:39:29,623
...you'd be riding Derby winners...

1427
01:39:29,797 --> 01:39:34,234
...Lenny'd be the middleweight champion
and I'd be Doctor Kildare.

1428
01:39:35,869 --> 01:39:36,893
And Vic?

1429
01:39:36,971 --> 01:39:40,463
Well, I reckon Vic's where he wants to be.

1430
01:39:40,708 --> 01:39:42,938
I reckon Vic's got it sorted out.

1431
01:39:43,010 --> 01:39:44,170
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1432
01:39:45,679 --> 01:39:48,045
If you ever get the chance...

1433
01:39:48,115 --> 01:39:50,948
...Raysy. If you ever get the option...

1434
01:39:52,419 --> 01:39:53,886
...you go first.

1435
01:39:54,755 --> 01:39:56,985
It's the carrying on that's hard.

1436
01:39:58,559 --> 01:39:59,821
Ending...

1437
01:40:00,561 --> 01:40:01,823
...it ain't nothing.

1438
01:40:03,897 --> 01:40:06,229
That ain't an option I've got, is it?

1439
01:40:06,633 --> 01:40:08,328
I mean, if anyone has.

1440
01:40:08,402 --> 01:40:10,870
Seeing as it's just me.

1441
01:40:11,972 --> 01:40:13,269
You never know.

1442
01:40:15,509 --> 01:40:18,672
Still, I reckon I'm lucky.

1443
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:21,371
Nah. I'm Lucky.

1444
01:40:24,218 --> 01:40:26,413
It'll be harder for Amy.

1445
01:40:26,987 --> 01:40:27,954
Yeah.

1446
01:40:28,022 --> 01:40:30,183
She'll need looking after, Raysy.

1447
01:40:30,257 --> 01:40:31,155
Yeah.

1448
01:40:32,659 --> 01:40:34,786
We've got to see Amy right.

1449
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:41,195
It's all a gamble, isn't it?

1450
01:40:41,402 --> 01:40:42,460
Yeah.

1451
01:40:43,837 --> 01:40:45,134
Yeah, it is.

1452
01:40:47,708 --> 01:40:48,970
Just a gamble.

1453
01:40:57,184 --> 01:40:59,015
<i>It's going to be all right, Amy.</i>

1454
01:41:01,622 --> 01:41:03,920
Jack's made sure
you're going to be all right.

1455
01:41:05,359 --> 01:41:09,090
That 20 grand. There's no problem.
There's nothing hanging over you.

1456
01:41:11,265 --> 01:41:14,257
You can have that bungalow in Margate
if you wanted it.

1457
01:41:16,837 --> 01:41:18,896
Or.... Maybe...

1458
01:41:20,774 --> 01:41:24,471
...you might go on a little trip down under.

1459
01:41:26,780 --> 01:41:29,749
Think you'd fancy that, down under?

1460
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:35,285
Australia's a long way, Ray.

1461
01:41:35,355 --> 01:41:36,413
Oh, yeah.

1462
01:41:37,991 --> 01:41:40,084
But then I do like traveling about.

1463
01:41:41,995 --> 01:41:43,019
Well....

1464
01:41:49,069 --> 01:41:50,559
Come here.

1465
01:41:54,541 --> 01:41:57,305
-Here, Vince. Come here.
-What?

1466
01:41:59,446 --> 01:42:01,175
About your £1,000.

1467
01:42:01,515 --> 01:42:02,504
I've got it.

1468
01:42:02,583 --> 01:42:03,709
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1469
01:42:04,551 --> 01:42:06,610
I'll explain when we get home.

1470
01:42:08,355 --> 01:42:09,322
Yeah.

1471
01:42:10,557 --> 01:42:12,388
See Amy all right, too.

1472
01:42:14,128 --> 01:42:15,117
Yeah.

1473
01:42:17,865 --> 01:42:21,164
I think Amy made the right decision
after all, don't you?

1474
01:42:21,235 --> 01:42:22,224
Yeah.

1475
01:42:25,606 --> 01:42:26,698
God help us.

1476
01:42:26,773 --> 01:42:29,173
-Not far.
-Nearly there now, Jack.

1477
01:42:40,521 --> 01:42:41,715
Here we are.

1478
01:42:44,424 --> 01:42:45,618
Over here.

1479
01:42:48,762 --> 01:42:51,162
Not too near the edge.
The wind will take him.

1480
01:42:51,665 --> 01:42:53,223
Let the wind take him.

1481
01:42:53,300 --> 01:42:55,768
Here, keep your hands as dry as you can.

1482
01:43:00,841 --> 01:43:02,638
Right. Come on then.

1483
01:43:12,653 --> 01:43:14,416
Go on, Vince. Come on.

1484
01:43:18,825 --> 01:43:19,849
Goodbye, Jack.

1485
01:43:19,927 --> 01:43:20,757
Yeah.

1486
01:43:21,328 --> 01:43:22,420
'Bye, Jack.

1487
01:43:22,496 --> 01:43:23,428
'Bye, Jack.

1488
01:43:34,841 --> 01:43:36,570
-'Bye, Jack.
-'Bye, Dad.

1489
01:43:36,643 --> 01:43:38,008
Bye-bye, Jack.

1490
01:43:42,382 --> 01:43:43,474
Go on, Ray.

1491
01:43:44,051 --> 01:43:45,313
Goodbye, Jack.

1492
01:43:45,686 --> 01:43:46,880
'Bye, Jack.

1493
01:43:48,021 --> 01:43:49,318
Ta-ta, mate.

1494
01:44:34,501 --> 01:44:36,025
Dry work, eh, lads?

1495
01:44:37,037 --> 01:44:40,200
Yeah, a pint wouldn't be out of place,
would it?

1496
01:44:40,274 --> 01:44:43,072
Jack'd expect nothing less.

1497
01:44:43,543 --> 01:44:44,373
Here.

1498
01:44:44,444 --> 01:44:47,140
Drinks are on me.
If that's all right with you, Lenny.

1499
01:44:47,214 --> 01:44:48,340
Well done, Vic.

1500
01:44:48,415 --> 01:44:51,350
If you're shouting, Big Boy, I'm there.

1501
01:44:51,418 --> 01:44:53,682
Till the last bell rings.

1502
01:44:53,754 --> 01:44:56,655
Be my pleasure, Gunner.
Jack would expect nothing less.

1503
01:44:56,723 --> 01:44:57,849
Yeah.
