1
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:54,020
Tom, wait up.

2
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,300
I heard about Megan. You doing okay?

3
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,559
Train's running in 10 minutes.

4
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,839
That's the thing
about this messed-up disease.

5
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,780
My mother-in-law, God rest her soul,
she was only 66.

6
00:01:07,039 --> 00:01:09,340
Megan's 42.

7
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,478
It's about time, Hog Head.

8
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,380
Car trouble. Sorry, Tom.

9
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:17,199
What do I care?

10
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,140
I got your train today.
It's all set with the boys upstairs.

11
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:25,900
Take some time off.
We got you covered.

12
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,220
I wanna work.

13
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:32,700
Wait up, Tom.

14
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:37,639
All right, I wanna tell you this
as a friend and not your boss, Tom.

15
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,438
You're not dealing with this.

16
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,780
I'm dealing with it, my way.

17
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,438
All right.
I'll give you all the streaks you want...

18
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,839
...but if you don't
spend time with her now...

19
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,460
...you're gonna regret it
the rest of your life.

20
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,100
Give him his orders.

21
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,060
See you, Tom.

22
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,860
How long do I have?

23
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,559
I can't answer that.

24
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,940
Well, give me your best bet.

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,340
I won't hold you to it.

26
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,500
- Are you all right, Megan?
- Oh, yeah. I'm fine.

27
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,758
Hey, what's the date today?

28
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:08,638
Tuesday, February 2nd.

29
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,340
Tom, do you really think
you should be driving?

30
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:14,500
Don't you start with me too.

31
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,300
This is Stargazer Express.
We are setting up and running.

32
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,638
Wanda, your favorite train is leaving.

33
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,038
About time. Stargazer Express.

34
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,718
Come on, baby. Don't give us
a hard time over five little minutes.

35
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,359
Because you know you want me.

36
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,140
Like I want hemorrhoids.
Over and out. Romeo.

37
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,900
Over and out.

38
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,180
- Romeo, huh?
- Yes, sir.

39
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:46,420
Love on a train.
Man, there ain't nothing like it.

40
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,900
So. what do think about trains now?

41
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:12,980
I love trains.

42
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,860
I love you.

43
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:20,140
Tom? You done?

44
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:22,700
Yeah, I'm done.

45
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,260
Welcome to the Stargazer Express.

46
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,078
We'll be taking you all the way to
Oakland. and from there. on to Seattle.

47
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:50,900
So sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride.

48
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,679
Why, hello, Davey.

49
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,300
How's your poor mother, bless her,
on this lovely Tuesday morning?

50
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:13,318
- She's okay.
- Up and around, is she?

51
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:15,719
Not yet. But soon.

52
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,838
You sure?
Better tell her to watch her step then...

53
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:21,340
- ... all that drinking.
- Okay, later, Mrs. Brown.

54
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,860
Breakfast is ready, Mom.

55
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:39,660
Did you say your morning prayers?

56
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,500
Eat your eggs before they get cold.

57
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,359
No, sweetie, I don't want it.

58
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,660
Mom, you have to eat something.

59
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:52,758
Kneel, Davey.

60
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:54,599
I said my prayers.

61
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,420
Well, say them again, sweetie.

62
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,060
O God, come to my aid.

63
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:06,580
I can't hear you, sweetie.

64
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,359
O Lord, make haste to help me.

65
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,740
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son,
and to the Holy Spirit.

66
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,900
Hallelujah.

67
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:22,198
You know, it's after 10.

68
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,878
You slept so hard,
I didn't wanna wake you.

69
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:27,078
I feel stronger.

70
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:31,100
I knew it. I told you you'd feel better.

71
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:35,500
How long before the train gets here,
sweetie?

72
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,620
Thirty minutes.

73
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:40,999
We're gonna see the train?

74
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,958
Yeah, Davey.

75
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,540
You mean it?

76
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:50,919
We don't have to,
if you're not feeling well.

77
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,780
I'm fine, baby.

78
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,860
Here, that's two for you...

79
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:00,580
...and three for me.

80
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,660
- What for?
- To make us happy, baby.

81
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,740
To make us happy.

82
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,159
Honey, can you get the phone,
please?

83
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,260
I got it, Mom.

84
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,278
Hello?

85
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:37,999
Hi. this is the principal
at Eastside Elementary School.

86
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,919
I'm calling because Davey
hasn't been in school.

87
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,460
Well, you see, his mother died.

88
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,599
Oh. I'm very sorry.
We weren't aware of that.

89
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,518
Please let us know
when he'll be back. all right?

90
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:55,780
Okay. Thank you.

91
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,540
Are you still taking classes?

92
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,500
- Yeah. Of course.
- Accounting 101?

93
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,380
Intermediate Accounting 3.

94
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:11,679
I'm telling you, Tom, if you were smart,
you'd be going too.

95
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,380
Trains, I mean, I love it, man,
but it's a dying business.

96
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,700
Mom.

97
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:35,860
Are you okay?

98
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,340
Yeah, I'm fine.

99
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,220
We'll wait, Davey.

100
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,798
- We'll wait until it comes, and then-
- Did you know the Stargazer Express...

101
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:50,678
...goes all the way to Seattle?

102
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:53,020
I love you, baby.

103
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:57,260
- Cold today.
- I know.

104
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,199
Good morning, passengers.

105
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,820
We are approaching
beautiful Simi Valley...

106
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,220
...right on time.

107
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,340
O God, you are my God.

108
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:10,119
I wait for you from the dawn.

109
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,780
There's two engineers
on each passenger train.

110
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,740
My body longs for you.

111
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,758
Pray with me, baby.

112
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:22,220
- But I already prayed.
- Pray with me, Davey.

113
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:26,300
My lips will praise you...

114
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,100
...for your mercy is better
than life itself.

115
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:34,820
It's here.

116
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,860
Wait, Mom, don't go, it's coming.

117
00:09:49,159 --> 00:09:51,319
Mom, what are you doing?

118
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,140
Mom!

119
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,038
It's time to rest now, baby.

120
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:57,918
- Mom. Mom, wake up.
- Be brave, honey.

121
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,700
It's gonna be over soon, baby.

122
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:03,079
Mom! The train's gonna come!

123
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,580
- Mom, wake up! What are you doing?
- It's okay.

124
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:11,359
- Object on the tracks.
- What?

125
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,038
Objects on tracks. Call it in.

126
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:15,398
- Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.
- Call it in!

127
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:17,038
All right, I'm slowing down.

128
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:19,439
This is Stargazer Express,
approaching Highway 6.

129
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,119
We have an object on tracks.
repeat, object on tracks.

130
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,620
Sixty-eight miles an hour.

131
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:25,860
Mom!

132
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,060
Mom!

133
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,020
Wake up!

134
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:36,300
Oh, my God.

135
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:39,380
- What's the speed?
- Fifty-five miles an hour.

136
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,999
Still too fast, man. We're still too fast.

137
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,839
- We gotta stop this train, man.
- No!

138
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,518
No, no, no!
You're not stopping the goddamn train!

139
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:48,558
What are you talking about?
We gotta try!

140
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:50,678
We can't.
We got too many cars on the turn.

141
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:53,918
- We have to take the chance!
- Hands off! We're following procedure!

142
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:57,860
- Screw procedure, Tom!
- There's nothing we can do about it now!

143
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,439
There is nothing we can do!

144
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,700
Help! Someone help me!

145
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,500
What are you doing?

146
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:08,940
Mom! Mom! Get out!

147
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:12,300
Fifty miles per hour.

148
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:14,479
- Oh, my God.
- Forty-eight.

149
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,580
- All right, brace for impact.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

150
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:19,940
Mom!

151
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,260
Perfect.

152
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,940
Thanks.

153
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,460
May I?

154
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,140
The railroad.

155
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:23,020
Are you a trainman?

156
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,420
You ever been on one?

157
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:34,780
I don't know
if I should kiss you or slap you.

158
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,918
Repeat after me: I.

159
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:41,038
- I.
- Would like.

160
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:42,678
Would like.

161
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,278
To take you out sometime.

162
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,959
To take you out sometime.
You'd go out with me?

163
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,839
Well, now that you've asked me
so nicely, why not?

164
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,620
Hey, Megan.

165
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,500
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

166
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,918
- What's going on?
- Okay.

167
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:10,878
- Jesus.
- I'm...

168
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:13,278
I'm planting flowers.

169
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:16,199
Well, not in your condition.
You can't do this kind of work.

170
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,959
Where's Tom? Oh, jeez. Hold on.

171
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,599
Okay, thanks.

172
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,119
I thought he was keeping
an eye on you.

173
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,900
Sometimes I think he can't stand
to be around me.

174
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:33,980
Here.
Just in case you change your mind.

175
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,660
It's beautiful, isn't it?

176
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:42,940
The piano?

177
00:13:43,879 --> 00:13:47,678
- I ordered it.
- You're kidding me.

178
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:49,398
Oh, Megan.

179
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:52,878
I'm gonna learn how to play.
I've always wanted to learn.

180
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:55,260
Megan, you have to rest.

181
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:02,620
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage. rage. rage

182
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,599
Against the dying of the light.

183
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,060
Is that what you're doing? Raging?

184
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,620
It's a poem.
It's a Dylan Thomas poem.

185
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:23,540
- Do you want me to get that?
- Yeah. Thanks.

186
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:32,140
Stark residence.

187
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:36,700
No, no. It's not.
Who should I say is calling?

188
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,140
Oh, is he all right?

189
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,620
Yes.

190
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:49,060
Yes. Thank you.

191
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:53,100
Tom had an accident.

192
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:09,239
Give your specimen samples
to this officer.

193
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,580
Cheers. Let me know if I'm pregnant.

194
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:21,959
Visual clearance coming
off the corner was 300 feet.

195
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:26,300
If you do the math, the posted was 60,
figure it was between 50 and 45, but...

196
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,460
It was a suicide.

197
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,398
No doubt about it.
We did everything by the book.

198
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,918
- The box will tell you that.
- We know you did, Tom.

199
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:38,260
It's just a complicated situation.

200
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,439
It's a suicide. It's not complicated.

201
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,999
Not when there's a woman
and a young child involved.

202
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,798
We're bringing you on the carpet.

203
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:50,479
Some whack-job
drives a car in front of my train...

204
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,518
- ... and it's my fault?
- We don't have a choice on this one.

205
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,558
No one remembers Victor Lopez,
but everybody knows Susan Smith.

206
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:59,398
- What the hell's that supposed to mean?
- Victor Lopez.

207
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:02,420
It's the homeless man
who dove under my train in Oxnard.

208
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,918
Tom, nobody cares if some wacko
throws himself under a train...

209
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:08,940
...but everybody feels
for a mother and her child.

210
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,959
Wait, Tom, look.
Look, I'll talk to him. Hold up, Tom.

211
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,999
Hey, it's a week, 10 days max,
you know?

212
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,758
Take time off. Give us a chance...

213
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:19,599
- ... to prove you did everything right.
- You know we did.

214
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,060
You know this is a formality, Tom.

215
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,860
We gotta do this.

216
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:28,239
I'm sorry, excuse me.
This way, this way. Excuse me.

217
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,060
You didn't stop.

218
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,140
You didn't stop.

219
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,678
Hi. Are you okay?

220
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:39,839
- Yeah, I'm all right.
- What happened?

221
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,918
Taking some time off.

222
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:45,220
- They're making you?
- You saw the doctor?

223
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:50,300
- Susan brought some soup over.
- Not hungry.

224
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:53,020
You have to do chemo again?

225
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,820
You know, this room, the kitchen?

226
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:01,780
It's my favorite room
in the whole house.

227
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,719
The only room we fully unpacked.

228
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,940
Yeah. What did the doctor say, Meg?
What are the options?

229
00:17:07,639 --> 00:17:09,839
We don't have any options.

230
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:13,820
I have days, weeks, maybe months.

231
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:19,420
The cancer has metastasized
to my bones.

232
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,479
So we'll treat it again.
It's gonna be hard, but-

233
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,260
It's over.

234
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,558
What are you talking about?
No, no, no. We gotta fight this. We-

235
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,078
I'm done fighting, Tom.

236
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:37,358
The chemo made me sick,
and the cancer's too advanced.

237
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:40,318
I don't wanna spend the rest of my life
in a hospital room...

238
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:42,719
...full of tubes and syringes
and oncologists.

239
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,060
- Come on, there's gotta be something.
- There's nothing.

240
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,838
We have to. We gotta try.
I mean, we gotta try to...

241
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:53,358
Gotta try to find a way to deal,
you know, with-

242
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:55,220
Death.

243
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:58,500
Say it.

244
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,919
You know what, this is only for tonight.
Tomorrow, we'll find you a good home.

245
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,540
Okay? You don't feel tired?

246
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:31,100
You need to get a little bit of sleep
if you can.

247
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,940
Good night, David.

248
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:38,420
Okay.

249
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:01,159
Well, maybe now that you have
some time off...

250
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,220
...maybe we can go to San Francisco.

251
00:19:06,359 --> 00:19:10,340
There's gonna be a hearing.
I have to be around to find out when.

252
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:13,358
Great.

253
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:15,919
An official excuse.

254
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,700
No, it's not an excuse.

255
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,780
If I'm absent at the hearing,
I'll lose my job.

256
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,740
You're like sand, Tom.

257
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:30,260
Harder I try to hold onto you,
the faster you slip through my fingers.

258
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,220
Okay.

259
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,180
It's okay.

260
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,260
No.

261
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,300
Out.

262
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,740
Meggie?

263
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:14,358
Tom thinks that we can help you.

264
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:17,020
He was very convincing
over the phone.

265
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,838
Well, we're a center
for alternative approaches...

266
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:22,159
...to treat or ameliorate disease.

267
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:28,220
We offer applied kinesiology,
cupping, even electromagnetic therapy.

268
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,798
Can you cure me?

269
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:35,580
As a professional in the medical field,
you know that there are no guarantees.

270
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,060
However, we can try
to rejuvenate your system...

271
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:43,758
...teach you a number
of relaxation techniques...

272
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:47,278
...such as meditation,
deep breathing, self-hypnosis.

273
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:50,100
All of these will help you relax.

274
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:52,479
I don't wanna relax.

275
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,358
- I wanna live.
- Honey...

276
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:56,479
Why don't we just
hear what she has to say.

277
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,159
It's all right, Tom.
Of course you wanna live, Megan.

278
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,038
And I would like to spend
what little is left of my life...

279
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,919
...doing exactly what I want to do...

280
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,780
...which does not include
electromagnetic therapy.

281
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:14,180
Okay. Thank you.

282
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:20,318
- You're not even listening to me.
- What do you want?

283
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:22,879
- What would you like me to do?
- What happened to us?

284
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,999
- What are you talking about?
- You heard me.

285
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,838
- Meggie, come on.
- Don't "Meggie" me.

286
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:29,159
- I'm not some fragile thing.
- What do you want?

287
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,919
I wanna know why
we never had children. How about that?

288
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,479
I don't know, because we never found
the time. We never found the time.

289
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,719
How could we have time?

290
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,439
We moved in 10 different houses
in 15 years of marriage.

291
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,679
I'm a trainman.
That's what trainmen do.

292
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,118
That is not what trainmen do,
that's what you did.

293
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:47,879
That's not what trainmen do.
It's not the rules for trainmen.

294
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,380
How could anybody, anybody,
have a child like that?

295
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,460
You got sick.

296
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:00,860
You're blaming me?

297
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:07,180
No, I'm not blaming anyone.

298
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:10,060
It was just the way things worked out.

299
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:32,020
I thought I had all this time...

300
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,300
...to be a woman.

301
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,220
To be a wife...

302
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,420
...and a nurse, and a mother.

303
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:49,038
Then I found out I didn't. I just didn't.

304
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,260
I don't have any time.

305
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:56,460
I probably would have made
a lousy father, anyway.

306
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,100
I'm not afraid to die.

307
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:04,820
But to think that I haven't lived?

308
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:10,540
That terrifies me.

309
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:15,719
Thank you so much
for agreeing to do this so quickly.

310
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,798
You will be gentle with him,
though, Judy?

311
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:20,220
I think he suffers from PTSD.

312
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,460
These kids don't need pity.

313
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:25,558
They require structure and discipline.
That's my gift to them.

314
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:29,038
- Right, it's just that his mother was-
- Now, stop. You already told me.

315
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,479
Separate yourself from your job, Renee.
They're not your children.

316
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,380
Of course. You're right.

317
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:39,420
Thanks.

318
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,580
It's a nice room, huh?

319
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,518
Well, it's a little pink, but at least
you have it all to yourself, right?

320
00:24:54,519 --> 00:24:57,740
It's definitely better
than temporary boarding.

321
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,140
I don't wanna stay here.

322
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,879
This is gonna be a great place for you,
David.

323
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,318
Please don't make me stay.

324
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:09,479
- You're gonna be safe.
- Please.

325
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,558
Honey, you'll be safe,
and I think you'll really like Judy.

326
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:17,820
You let her know if you need anything,
and she'll get in touch with me, all right?

327
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,940
Bye.

328
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:45,180
Used to be my girl's room.

329
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:49,140
We asked for a girl...

330
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,740
...but you were an emergency.

331
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,460
You want some clean clothes?

332
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:05,020
This'll have to do for now.

333
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,460
We'll talk later.

334
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:19,118
And it cleans for months.
Never scrub your toilet again.

335
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,118
Authorities have just revealed
the identity of the woman...

336
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:26,879
...that was killed in the Simi Valley
train crash as 27-year-old Laura Danner.

337
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,598
The police say that her 11-year-old son.
David Danner...

338
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:31,358
...had been with her in the car...

339
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:35,118
...but he somehow managed
to escape the accident unharmed.

340
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:39,278
I'm told that the senior engineer
who was driving that train. Tom Stark...

341
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:43,118
...and his partner. Otis Higgs.
have been suspended pending-

342
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:45,679
Kitchen is off-limits
between mealtimes.

343
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,838
TV privileges are permission only.
Understood?

344
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:50,838
- Yes.
- "Yes, ma'am. "

345
00:26:50,839 --> 00:26:53,780
As long as you live here,
you'll play by my rules.

346
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,278
Listen to your own rules.

347
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:58,060
Go to your room.

348
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,780
You're the one
who should stay out of the kitchen.

349
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,679
You're bad.
I knew it the moment I saw you.

350
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:06,239
Get to your room. Now.

351
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,900
Go.

352
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,060
Get dressed and go to sleep.

353
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:25,820
Hello?

354
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:34,300
Hello? Anybody here?

355
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,380
I fancy they're long gone.

356
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:49,500
The officers.
They collected their evidence and left.

357
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:51,479
You knew them?

358
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,020
Laura and Davey? I suppose so.

359
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:00,639
You look a bit pale, dearie.

360
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,180
- I do feel a little...
- Come on. Let me get you a cup of tea.

361
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:08,798
Tom? Where are you?

362
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,740
I'm out in the garage.

363
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,460
Hey, man, I'm sorry to disturb you
at the house, but...

364
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,140
I had no idea you were
into model trains. This is nice.

365
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,460
Hey, man, you mind
if we go get a beer or something?

366
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:29,100
Yeah, sure.

367
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,380
Let me get my coat.

368
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,239
We'll let it brew a while.

369
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,700
- You're very kind.
- Now...

370
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:43,078
...I've lived in this building five years.

371
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:45,598
Now, Laura and I,
we were never bosom buddies...

372
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:48,399
...but you don't live
that long next door to someone...

373
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,959
...without getting to know
them on an intimate level.

374
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,460
So did she ever mention suicide
to you?

375
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:55,919
Oh, you are a nosy one.

376
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,719
Poking and snooping.

377
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,798
Now, how did you find us?
Who sent you?

378
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:01,999
- It's listed in...
- Well, dear, dear, dear.

379
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,358
- Call information if you don't believe me.
- Trying times indeed, huh?

380
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:07,100
Oh, cookies!

381
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,980
No, thank you.

382
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,260
Really.

383
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,798
So you were saying, about Laura.

384
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,439
Oh, yeah. Bless her.

385
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,380
I looked after the boy
here and there, you know.

386
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,798
Couldn't help but notice the men
coming and going from her apartment.

387
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:27,798
I mean,
haven't been anybody for ages.

388
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:30,358
But they used to flock
around her like hungry birds.

389
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:32,118
But they stopped coming?

390
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:34,159
Well, she had a breakdown.

391
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,959
Nerves disease.

392
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,180
Monstrous, really,
the tricks our mind plays on us.

393
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,598
Well, I used to drop by, do chores.

394
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:43,959
Cook for the boy.

395
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,439
But frankly,
she needed professional help.

396
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,340
Tea?

397
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,540
So she gave up.

398
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:56,220
Is that why you think she did it?

399
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,060
I really don't know.

400
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,420
- Have you thought about it?
- About what?

401
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,420
The accident.

402
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,758
I'm just...

403
00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:10,300
I'm having a little bit
of a hard time with it.

404
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,318
Yeah, I- I don't wanna talk about it.

405
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:18,180
Look, I'm- I'm gonna talk to N.B.

406
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,300
I'm gonna give him my notice.

407
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,439
No, you- You can't do that. That makes
it look like we did something wrong.

408
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,838
- That's because we did.
- We didn't have a choice.

409
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:30,199
- We didn't?
- No.

410
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,038
If we'd used that emergency brake...

411
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:34,679
...wheels could've flattened,
train could've derailed.

412
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,838
- We'll never know-
- We're not gonna know...

413
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:39,999
...but- But it was a judgment call,
and I- I made it.

414
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,980
We killed a human being.

415
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,740
A person, Tom. I don't know...

416
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:46,740
...how I can...

417
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,820
It was a suicide.

418
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:55,740
Suicide.

419
00:31:58,119 --> 00:32:01,518
You know, the homeless man
was my first one? Victor Lopez?

420
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,580
Come on, come on.
Can we talk about something else?

421
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:07,660
It was right before
the end of the run and...

422
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:11,100
I mean, we had a smooth ride
going for like 10 hours.

423
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:16,919
And then I see him. I mean, he's
standing on the tracks, clear as day.

424
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,558
And I'm blowing the horn. I'm-

425
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,420
I'm ringing the bell.
I mean, I'm doing everything.

426
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,020
He just ignored us.

427
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,140
They turn us into executioners.

428
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,260
You know what he did
right before we hit him?

429
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,740
He smiled at us.

430
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,060
He had a death wish, you know?

431
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,780
Some people do.

432
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,180
Other people don't wanna die,
they die anyway.

433
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,220
I'm gonna wait
till the hearing's done...

434
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:56,078
...but I'm giving my notice.

435
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:57,639
Yeah, fine. Go ahead, do that.

436
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:01,159
- Come on, man. Don't be an asshole.
- Because I got no time for a quitter.

437
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,220
You know what your problem is?

438
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:08,020
Everything is dying around you and you
just can't deal with it, can you?

439
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,479
Hey! Hey, get out!

440
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,199
Get out! Now! Let's go!

441
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,060
Get out!

442
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,999
Talk about my wife again, I'll kill you.

443
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,758
You know what? Fuck you, Tom!
At least I'm alive.

444
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:29,460
You're dead inside
and everybody knows it!

445
00:33:43,839 --> 00:33:45,340
What are you doing?

446
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:53,838
I'm leaving for San Francisco,
tomorrow, alone.

447
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:57,078
No, just wait...

448
00:33:57,079 --> 00:34:00,679
...wait until after the hearing
and I'll come with you.

449
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,380
No, you won't.

450
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:06,740
You'll- You'll sign up
for more train trips.

451
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,660
Come on, Meg,
let me make it up to you.

452
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:14,260
What for?

453
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,580
A final goodbye?

454
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,940
Good night.

455
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,118
- Are you the conductor?
- Yes.

456
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,518
I'm looking for my Uncle Tom.

457
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:36,319
Yeah, I've seen him in this cab.
This is his train.

458
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,820
You mean Tom Stark?
I didn't know he had relatives.

459
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,140
Yeah. He has a sister.

460
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,100
Sorry, kid, but Tom's not on duty today.
He's off because of the accident.

461
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,919
Well, actually, I don't think
I have the right address.

462
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,260
You want me to check his address?

463
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,340
Could you hurry?
My mom's waiting in the car.

464
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,839
You're bossy.

465
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,340
You're just like your uncle.

466
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,260
I'll just wait right here.

467
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:08,940
Are you ready to say you're sorry?

468
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:05,300
What happened?

469
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,180
Don't go.

470
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:15,500
I have to.

471
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:21,900
What's gonna happen if you get worse?
I mean...

472
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:27,620
...who's-?
Who's gonna take care of you there?

473
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,060
I'll figure it out.

474
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:38,540
Please don't go.

475
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:41,340
Please. I'm sorry.

476
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:43,540
Please.

477
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:05,678
Okay, I'll notify the police, Judy.

478
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:07,260
Thanks.

479
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,220
Crap.

480
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,540
I can't do this.

481
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,980
It's too late, Tom. Come on.

482
00:38:41,679 --> 00:38:43,380
- You didn't stop!
- Hey!

483
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,759
- Hey!
- What?

484
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,158
- What are you doing? Hey!
- Stop! All right, stop.

485
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:48,980
Get off me, kid.

486
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:50,780
He killed my mom!

487
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,158
Tom! Don't hurt him!

488
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:55,558
- What are you, nuts?
- Stop!

489
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:57,919
I didn't kill your mother,
she killed herself!

490
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,919
- Will you stop it!
- No, she didn't!

491
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,198
How fast were you going?
Sixty? Seventy?

492
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:06,198
- I was going 48.
- You didn't even try to stop!

493
00:39:06,199 --> 00:39:07,839
I don't owe you an explanation!

494
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,678
- Hey, Tom, stop it. Sweetie.
- Yes, you do!

495
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:13,759
- Stop it!
- You could've stopped! You didn't try!

496
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,919
- You didn't even try!
- Listen, come on.

497
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,238
Okay, come on.

498
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:20,158
- He killed my mother.
- Your mother killed herself.

499
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:22,860
Come sit down. Let's have some water.
Come on.

500
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,118
- It doesn't say.
- Yes, it does.

501
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,020
Show him where.

502
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:36,420
Page 55, code 343.

503
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,540
See, the- All the rules
are sort of listed in...

504
00:39:41,159 --> 00:39:44,038
Imagine a train
and it's g- It's going very fast.

505
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:47,158
- It's on the track and there's passen-
- Over 45 miles per hour.

506
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:50,038
The engineer's gonna use the
emergency brake on the turn...

507
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:53,678
- hundreds of passengers onboard-
- A chance that the train could derail.

508
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:56,140
- That's what it says.
- Right. That's right.

509
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:59,460
- Well, it's not for sure.
- It's a chance I couldn't take.

510
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,580
Okay, let me clean this hand up.

511
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:05,460
Here, all right,
it's just gonna hurt for a second.

512
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:08,598
There we go. Okay, push down.

513
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:11,598
What's your name, David or Davey?
What do you...?

514
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,140
Davey.

515
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,620
How'd you find me?

516
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,820
- I went on the train.
- What train?

517
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,718
And who's watching you now?

518
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:25,319
No one.

519
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,860
No family?

520
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,980
They put me in a foster home.

521
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:35,220
We gotta call the police.

522
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:41,340
If they're not here already.

523
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,919
Okay, here, just hold that like that.

524
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,799
It's gonna be okay. Don't worry.

525
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,919
No, just push it down.

526
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,759
Okay.

527
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,780
Don't go anywhere.

528
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,460
Is this the Stark residence?

529
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,140
Yeah.

530
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,780
Megan Stark?

531
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,180
- Yes.
- We have your piano.

532
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,700
My piano?

533
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,359
My piano.

534
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,799
Where do you want it?

535
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,718
- Inside.
- Okay.

536
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:18,140
- What piano?
- I...

537
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:22,460
My piano. I ordered it last week.

538
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,540
Hey.

539
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,479
What are we gonna do?

540
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:29,198
- We gotta get him out of here.
- No.

541
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:31,598
- Let him stay.
- Why? What are you talking about?

542
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,198
Just for one day.

543
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:36,158
No. I can't have contact
with the victim's family.

544
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:38,158
- I could lose my job.
- Please, Tom.

545
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:41,839
Did you see his face?
Did you see his-? His clothes?

546
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,439
He just lost his mother.

547
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,118
Somebody could be looking for him.

548
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:50,020
If he leaves, I'm leaving with him.

549
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,340
Do you want some more?

550
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:01,420
No, thanks.

551
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:13,860
What are you doing?

552
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,820
- I'm washing my dishes.
- No, no, I'll do it.

553
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,678
No, really, I don't mind.

554
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:22,598
It's okay.

555
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:25,420
You- You go on
and make yourself at home.

556
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,700
Do you play?

557
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,620
No.

558
00:43:03,159 --> 00:43:06,220
Oh, come on.
Let's get you cleaned up.

559
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:11,740
Right back this way is the restroom.

560
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:21,860
How you doing?

561
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,279
Good, ma'am.

562
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,620
You can call me Megan.

563
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:29,678
I'm just gonna leave some clean
clothes here by the door, okay?

564
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:31,260
Okay.

565
00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:43,260
Where is he?

566
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:45,660
Taking a bath.

567
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:48,140
He's so polite.

568
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,919
He's a strange kid.

569
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,820
He's too grown-up.

570
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,638
You should have seen
how he was raised.

571
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:00,380
What do you mean?

572
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:03,100
Don't get mad.

573
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:06,518
- I went to his house.
- Whose house?

574
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:09,759
David. Dav- David and
Laura's house in Simi Valley.

575
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,439
Why, why, why would you do that?

576
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,839
I went because I saw them
talking about her on the news.

577
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,359
- I had to know.
- You had to know? Had to know what?

578
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,038
There's nothing to know.
She put her car on the tracks.

579
00:44:20,039 --> 00:44:22,399
She was young, Tom.

580
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,260
She has a child.

581
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:29,300
I mean, why would anybody...?

582
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:32,140
It was important to me.

583
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:35,238
It was horrible,
the way they lived in their house.

584
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:37,140
It was just...

585
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:40,380
It was horrible.

586
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,399
Judy Neasy has been a
foster parent for many years.

587
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,300
She has an excellent reputation
with us.

588
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,759
She is a disciplinarian, but I got him
on such short notice, I thought that...

589
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,799
...after living with a mentally
ill mother, I thought maybe...

590
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,839
- ... discipline might be good for him.
- I'm sure you meant well.

591
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:12,700
- Do you have a picture?
- Yes, I do. Here you go.

592
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:17,999
We'll circulate it to our patrol units.

593
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,980
You will find him, won't you?

594
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,820
Gonna try this thing out?

595
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,999
No, he's sleeping.
I don't wanna wake him.

596
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,740
He won't wake up.

597
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:03,620
I'm glad that you didn't...

598
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:05,740
I know.

599
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,839
I wish we could keep him.

600
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,860
You promised one day.

601
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:51,580
He needs us.

602
00:46:53,159 --> 00:46:54,919
We could get in a lot of trouble.

603
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,999
It's against the law, and besides,
that's like kidnapping.

604
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,759
- So?
- So...

605
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,279
...if they find out
that he was even here for one day...

606
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,180
...they're not gonna reinstate me.

607
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:09,580
I'm asking you to do this for me.

608
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:19,500
If I don't work the rails, I'm nothing.

609
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,460
You're my husband.

610
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:35,540
I slept for almost a whole day.

611
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:40,100
I was so tired
and I didn't even know it.

612
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:43,580
Where's Tom?

613
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,900
He's out working on his model railroad.

614
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,300
He has a railroad?

615
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:54,959
It's out in the garage.
You can see it when you're all done.

616
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,820
I'm done!

617
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:11,100
This is really cool.

618
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,260
Why is it broken?

619
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:16,700
Well, I'll fix it in no time.

620
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:22,980
Gosh. All these stations and people.

621
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,820
It's so real.

622
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:29,900
Well, I've been at it for a while.

623
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:35,260
You ready?

624
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:43,540
Come on, kid.

625
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:52,799
Hey, Davey, here's our number.

626
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,319
And if you need anything,
anything at all, you just call me, okay?

627
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,900
I don't wanna go back there.

628
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:04,540
I know. But you can't stay here.
They won't let you.

629
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,820
Because of the accident?

630
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:09,500
Yes.

631
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,300
Meg.

632
00:49:41,199 --> 00:49:43,420
Hey, tuck your head down.

633
00:49:47,639 --> 00:49:49,700
What are you afraid of?

634
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,060
Nothing.

635
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:55,820
I just- I don't want
anyone to see you, is all.

636
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,540
Thank you. Thank you.

637
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:38,380
Thank you.

638
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:41,060
Okay.

639
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,100
Okay.

640
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:49,980
When did you start driving trains?

641
00:50:50,679 --> 00:50:52,319
Running trains.

642
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,060
How old were you?

643
00:50:55,199 --> 00:50:57,980
I don't know, I was about 30.

644
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,500
Passenger trains?

645
00:51:02,199 --> 00:51:03,919
Freight first.

646
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,820
Well, I'll be 12 in August.

647
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,839
- Hope you like chicken.
- Yeah, I love it.

648
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:16,180
My mom used to make it a lot.

649
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,660
Aren't you gonna say grace?

650
00:51:31,639 --> 00:51:33,820
We don't do that here.

651
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,820
Tom.

652
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:39,279
Dear Jesus,
I wanna thank you for the meal...

653
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,359
...that we're going to receive and-

654
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,980
Excuse me.

655
00:51:44,719 --> 00:51:46,460
Davey...

656
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:49,580
...don't worry.

657
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,860
Thanks.

658
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,620
He didn't mean to.

659
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:13,799
- I'm going out for a little bit.
- Where you going?

660
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,558
I'm gonna go get him some clothes.

661
00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:18,238
- He can't keep wearing your T-shirts.
- Well, let me go.

662
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:21,078
I mean, you've been going nonstop.
No, let me go. Yeah.

663
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:23,060
Are you sure?

664
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,660
Yeah, wh-? Wh-?
What should I get?

665
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:34,839
I made a list.

666
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,718
- Boy's jeans.
- Yeah.

667
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:38,319
Don't know what size.

668
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,839
Socks, a toothbrush, definitely.

669
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:44,198
- I'm not sure if you think-
- Okay, get whatever's on here, right?

670
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:45,940
Yeah.

671
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:50,238
What the hell are we doing?

672
00:52:50,239 --> 00:52:55,380
I don't know. I don't know,
but it feels good.

673
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:00,060
I feel better than I have in a long time.

674
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:52,260
Wanna help?

675
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,260
Yeah.

676
00:53:56,519 --> 00:53:57,820
Okay.

677
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:02,999
Figure out where your passengers might
want some shade, put these trees there.

678
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,020
- Okay.
- All right?

679
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:10,959
So, what do you call your railroad?

680
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:12,940
I call it the Stark Special.

681
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,078
That's a nice name for a railroad.

682
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:18,220
Yeah, I like to think so.

683
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,460
I like that engine you got there.

684
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,340
My mom gave it to me.

685
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:33,479
She was a lot like Megan.
She cooked a lot and cleaned.

686
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,279
And she'd help me with my homework.

687
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,900
Yeah, I'm sure she was
Mother of the Year.

688
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:51,740
Shit.

689
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:55,020
You know what?
All that won't be necessary.

690
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:59,940
I just want you to teach me
one really beautiful song.

691
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:36,060
That's perfect. What's it called?

692
00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:37,678
"A Maiden's Prayer. "

693
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:40,100
"A Maiden's Prayer"?

694
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:44,900
It's pretty. Okay. Now...

695
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,980
Okay, just place this finger here.

696
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,820
- Like so.
- Okay.

697
00:55:55,639 --> 00:55:57,879
You've really never seen one?

698
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,759
They don't have them in Simi Valley.

699
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,919
Well, they're big and blue and wet.

700
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:03,860
You're such a poet.

701
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,340
How you doing? You all right?

702
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,460
Thank you.

703
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:53,660
Maybe I should dance with Davey.

704
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:13,020
Come on, man.
Don't keep a lady waiting.

705
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:06,620
Thank you.

706
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,060
Davey?

707
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:50,220
Davey? Are you okay?

708
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,140
What's going on?

709
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,660
Can I get you something?

710
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:05,540
Do you wanna talk about it?

711
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,420
Was it a bad dream?

712
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,140
I was pretending.

713
01:00:19,239 --> 01:00:21,420
Pretending what?

714
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:27,060
That you were my mother,
and that we were a family.

715
01:00:29,519 --> 01:00:35,180
I told Tom that my mom cooked,
and helped me with homework.

716
01:00:37,239 --> 01:00:39,300
She didn't.

717
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:41,980
Not for a long time.

718
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:52,660
She did the best for you
that she could.

719
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:55,420
She tried really hard.

720
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:02,078
I know she did.

721
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,940
Here.

722
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:06,620
You go to sleep, okay?
Let's get you back in bed.

723
01:01:23,159 --> 01:01:24,919
Davey?

724
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:27,820
Do you want me to sit with you
for a few minutes?

725
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:30,460
Okay.

726
01:02:00,239 --> 01:02:01,980
Morning.

727
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:05,660
Oh, my God. I fell asleep.

728
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:07,740
Want tea?

729
01:02:16,159 --> 01:02:17,460
Thank you.

730
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:52,500
So how long have you had
that engine?

731
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,900
My mom said my dad left it for me.

732
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:59,940
He wanted me to have it
when I turned 6.

733
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:03,100
I guess he liked trains.

734
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:06,580
Did your dad like trains?

735
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,420
Never knew him.

736
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,220
I didn't know mine either.

737
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:18,820
It's a bird.

738
01:03:22,519 --> 01:03:24,540
Cool.

739
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:33,460
Good.

740
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:46,359
- Sexy stuff, huh?
- That is irresistible.

741
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,780
- That's for you.
- Do that again.

742
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,660
You only get it once.

743
01:03:57,519 --> 01:03:59,380
Thank you.

744
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:04,940
Oh, my gosh.

745
01:04:10,119 --> 01:04:12,580
My gosh.

746
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:14,940
Tom.

747
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,198
We can't afford that. That's beautiful.

748
01:04:18,199 --> 01:04:20,260
Repeat after me.

749
01:04:21,719 --> 01:04:23,580
Happy.

750
01:04:25,559 --> 01:04:29,359
- Happy.
- Valentine's day.

751
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:32,100
Valentine's Day.

752
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:50,598
Oh, my, so much time has passed.

753
01:04:50,599 --> 01:04:53,140
Do you know something?

754
01:04:53,679 --> 01:04:59,279
I remember certain moments
with such clarity...

755
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:03,420
...like it was just yesterday.

756
01:05:11,719 --> 01:05:13,660
Let me do that.

757
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:17,900
That's perfect.

758
01:05:21,679 --> 01:05:24,060
Remember the first time
you spoke to me?

759
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:27,980
I remember.

760
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:33,180
- Our first train ride.
- And our second.

761
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:38,500
Good night. Sweet dreams.

762
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:46,140
"He fought by instinct,
but he could also fight with his mind. "

763
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:48,118
What's instinct?

764
01:05:48,119 --> 01:05:50,759
It's a feeling that you get
in your stomach...

765
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:53,660
...that tells you
if something is right or wrong.

766
01:05:56,719 --> 01:06:01,420
"He rushed as if trying a shoulder trick
that had failed before.

767
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,198
I I
But at the last moment...

768
01:06:04,199 --> 01:06:06,060
What is it?

769
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,780
The hearing's in five days.

770
01:06:15,239 --> 01:06:17,660
In five days what?

771
01:06:17,679 --> 01:06:19,638
It's the official hearing.

772
01:06:19,639 --> 01:06:23,940
It's when they'll decide
whether Tom did the right thing...

773
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,140
...in the accident.

774
01:06:27,159 --> 01:06:30,158
What if they decide
he didn't do the right thing?

775
01:06:30,159 --> 01:06:32,518
He won't be an engineer anymore.

776
01:06:32,519 --> 01:06:38,540
It's okay. Tom is capable.
He can do a lot of different things.

777
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:42,300
But there's nothing like running a train.

778
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,940
Go on.

779
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,479
What do you call this one?

780
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:56,820
That's the Atlas 3086.

781
01:06:57,840 --> 01:07:01,380
- It's really nice.
- Yeah, thanks.

782
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:07,260
I could tell them she wanted to die.

783
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,020
What?

784
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:14,300
You could say it at your trial.

785
01:07:16,239 --> 01:07:21,980
No, it's a hearing. It's not a trial.
It's all right. Thanks.

786
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,300
You don't want me to tell them?

787
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:30,638
It doesn't really matter
if your mom wanted to die or not.

788
01:07:30,639 --> 01:07:34,300
The only thing that matters
is if I handled the situation correctly.

789
01:07:34,719 --> 01:07:36,060
I forgive you.

790
01:07:40,519 --> 01:07:42,660
You forgive me for what?

791
01:07:44,719 --> 01:07:48,060
She took away my options
when she put her car on the tracks.

792
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,740
Yeah, she did.

793
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:54,620
It just so happens she chose my train.

794
01:07:57,079 --> 01:07:58,620
I know.

795
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,118
I got zero.

796
01:08:16,119 --> 01:08:17,479
- No sick days?
- None.

797
01:08:17,480 --> 01:08:19,879
Excuse me. Hi, I was wondering
if you could help.

798
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:24,558
Well, what is a pretty girl like you
doing in a train station all alone?

799
01:08:24,559 --> 01:08:27,518
Well, I'm looking for a missing boy.
Maybe you've seen him.

800
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:29,559
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We saw this guy, right?

801
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:31,639
- When did we see him?
- Yeah. He just left.

802
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:34,679
He was riding a horse,
and he said Darth Vader was his father.

803
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:36,118
- Yeah-
- Yeah, thanks a lot.

804
01:08:36,119 --> 01:08:39,020
Wait, wait, wait. Let me see that.

805
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:44,278
This is Tom's nephew.

806
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:45,959
- No.
- Yeah.

807
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:47,740
Who's Tom?

808
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:57,460
He said he forgave me
for killing his mom.

809
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:04,700
It used to be so simple, you know?

810
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:10,318
Black and white.
There was a right thing to do...

811
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:12,820
...and a wrong thing to do.

812
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:18,780
Life is more like a gray area, Tom.

813
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:27,740
Not everything.

814
01:09:28,479 --> 01:09:31,020
Some things you know for certain.

815
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,478
Meggie.

816
01:09:56,479 --> 01:09:58,460
Hey, what's wrong?

817
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:00,540
She's fine.

818
01:10:13,319 --> 01:10:15,060
Here.

819
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:42,220
- The lady from Child Services.
- What?

820
01:10:42,479 --> 01:10:45,660
- She's at the door.
- It's all right. Stay here.

821
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:53,839
Who?

822
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,940
The woman who put me
in the foster home.

823
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:01,238
- Oh, hi. Tom Stark?
- Yeah.

824
01:11:01,239 --> 01:11:05,238
Hi, I'm Renee Hargrove.
Ventura Children and Family Services.

825
01:11:05,239 --> 01:11:09,358
We didn't actually meet, but I remember
seeing you at the scene of the accident.

826
01:11:09,359 --> 01:11:11,740
Would you mind if I came in?

827
01:11:14,199 --> 01:11:15,900
Sure.

828
01:11:16,079 --> 01:11:17,820
Thank you.

829
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:22,780
This is a lovely home.

830
01:11:25,079 --> 01:11:29,860
I am looking for a missing boy.
David Danner?

831
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:31,980
I know who he is.

832
01:11:32,479 --> 01:11:36,340
- Have you seen him since the accident?
- No.

833
01:11:36,439 --> 01:11:38,180
Really?

834
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:44,060
Oh, I forgot the book.

835
01:11:46,199 --> 01:11:47,959
Oh, this is a great book.

836
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:52,100
- Do you have children, Mr. Stark?
- That's my wife's.

837
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:57,679
Would you mind terribly if I just took
a little look around? Do you mind?

838
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,580
- Well-
- Thank you.

839
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:04,860
David ran away from his foster home.

840
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:08,438
So, what's that to me?

841
01:12:08,439 --> 01:12:11,679
Oh, Mr. Howie Pugh,
the train conductor.

842
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:14,999
He told me that David
was on the train looking for you.

843
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,460
He claimed to be your nephew.

844
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:19,660
My nephew?

845
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:25,679
Do you mind?

846
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:30,919
Yeah, actually I do.
I mean, this is my home.

847
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:34,438
I'm sorry. I know this is an imposition.

848
01:12:34,439 --> 01:12:39,180
Okay, you should go in here.
Go in here. Just be quiet.

849
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:45,719
Excuse me,
I don't think you heard what I said.

850
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:49,438
Tom? What's going on?

851
01:12:49,439 --> 01:12:51,260
My wife, Megan.

852
01:12:53,039 --> 01:12:57,180
Oh, I'm sorry to barge in like this,
but I'm looking for a missing boy.

853
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:00,438
Yes, and I couldn't help but notice...

854
01:13:00,439 --> 01:13:03,260
...that the walls
in this room smell freshly painted...

855
01:13:03,279 --> 01:13:05,580
...and there's a little toy train.

856
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:12,420
- You okay?
- She's sick.

857
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:20,078
I have cancer, stage four.

858
01:13:20,079 --> 01:13:21,980
It's in my bones.

859
01:13:22,199 --> 01:13:25,799
This is the spare room.
I have trouble sleeping.

860
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,719
At night I come in here...

861
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:32,919
...because I don't wanna disturb
my husband.

862
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:35,580
He's just painted it for me...

863
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:40,060
...because blue is my favorite color.

864
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:45,060
- I'm sorry.
- You said that already.

865
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:49,220
Do you want to look around?

866
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:52,220
No, no, that's okay.

867
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,620
I hope you feel better.

868
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:03,140
I could just show myself out.

869
01:14:03,359 --> 01:14:04,980
Thank you.

870
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,900
She's gone, kid.

871
01:14:34,079 --> 01:14:36,100
Still high.

872
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:41,020
We should tell him I'm sick.

873
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:46,780
No, it's too soon.

874
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,620
I don't think he's ready.

875
01:14:49,560 --> 01:14:52,078
I can call Susan
and tell her to bring some dinner.

876
01:14:52,079 --> 01:14:54,580
Don't worry about dinner, all right?

877
01:14:55,279 --> 01:14:57,180
Tom?

878
01:15:00,039 --> 01:15:02,300
It's gonna be okay.

879
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:17,980
Almost ready.

880
01:15:21,359 --> 01:15:25,500
And he wants to stay.
He needs us.

881
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:30,180
So that's that.

882
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,398
Yeah.

883
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:36,380
- That's the craziest thing I've ever heard.
- I know.

884
01:15:37,039 --> 01:15:40,740
- I mean, really.
- Yeah, it's pretty bad.

885
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:56,900
Good. Let it out.

886
01:16:04,039 --> 01:16:05,380
Get it up.

887
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:10,839
That's all you gotta do. Ready?

888
01:16:10,840 --> 01:16:12,919
Simi Valley Police Station.

889
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:15,540
Detective Crane, please.

890
01:16:21,319 --> 01:16:23,700
Detective Crane speaking.

891
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:26,060
Hello?

892
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:28,260
Hello?

893
01:16:28,399 --> 01:16:30,420
Is anyone there?

894
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:54,599
- You have to go. I'll be fine.
- Let's not kid ourselves.

895
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:57,959
Once they find out about the kid,
I'm out of a job. How many of these?

896
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:03,460
Two. They're not gonna find out
about him. You have to testify.

897
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:08,460
So you know for sure.

898
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:12,380
I know I did the right thing.

899
01:17:13,560 --> 01:17:15,780
Then tell them.

900
01:17:16,239 --> 01:17:22,140
I don't want you to have any regrets,
Tom. Not because of me.

901
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:25,980
No, honey, I won't.

902
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:27,839
I'm gonna go with you.

903
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:30,318
No, Meg. You're not well enough.

904
01:17:30,319 --> 01:17:33,340
Well, I'll feel worse if we don't go.

905
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,540
What about the kid?

906
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:38,780
We'll take him with us.

907
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:42,460
We'll wait in the car.

908
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:47,380
Oh, boy.

909
01:17:50,520 --> 01:17:52,180
All right.

910
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:55,879
- Thanks a lot, N.B. I appreciate it.
- You bet.

911
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:58,140
Ready for you, Tom.

912
01:17:58,159 --> 01:18:00,300
Hey, Otis.

913
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:03,900
You're gonna be the sexiest accountant
in town.

914
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:24,278
So this is an unofficial hearing, Tom,
and the goal of the proceedings...

915
01:18:24,279 --> 01:18:27,599
...is to determine if
an official investigation is necessary.

916
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:29,238
- I understand.
- Okay.

917
01:18:29,239 --> 01:18:31,559
For the record,
were you the senior engineer...

918
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:34,398
...on February 2nd,
the date of the fatal incident?

919
01:18:34,399 --> 01:18:35,559
I was.

920
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:38,238
And could you describe for us
what happened that day...

921
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:40,839
...to the best of your recollection?

922
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:45,500
- I wish I could go in.
- Me too.

923
01:18:46,319 --> 01:18:48,060
Why do we have to hide?

924
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:53,500
Why can't I just tell the social worker
I wanna stay with you?

925
01:18:54,319 --> 01:18:56,220
It doesn't work like that.

926
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,780
But why?

927
01:18:59,159 --> 01:19:02,719
People like to follow rules...

928
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:08,020
...and you staying with us
definitely goes against that.

929
01:19:10,119 --> 01:19:13,740
And what was your first reaction
when you saw the car?

930
01:19:14,439 --> 01:19:15,940
I slowed the train down.

931
01:19:17,279 --> 01:19:20,220
But you didn't use
the emergency brake.

932
01:19:21,159 --> 01:19:25,358
I decided not to. The emergency brake
wouldn't have stopped that train in time.

933
01:19:25,359 --> 01:19:29,020
But your partner thinks
the impact might have been prevented.

934
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:32,599
I disagree. At that speed,
with that many cars on the turn...

935
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:34,519
...we probably would've derailed.

936
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:38,780
If you could do it all over again,
would you do anything differently?

937
01:19:43,159 --> 01:19:44,660
Mr. Stark.

938
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,300
- I can't do it all over again.
- But if you could.

939
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:57,420
No.

940
01:19:57,680 --> 01:20:00,140
I wouldn't have done
anything differently.

941
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:11,380
It's over, Tom.

942
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:15,340
There's no official investigation.
Everything was by the book.

943
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:16,959
Where you going?

944
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:20,100
Hey, we got a streak schedule
for you tomorrow, Tom.

945
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:23,500
Megan. Megan...

946
01:20:23,640 --> 01:20:26,839
- I didn't do anything.
- It's okay. Get in the car. Get in the car.

947
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:28,660
Honey. Meggie.

948
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:31,318
- Honey.
- Megan.

949
01:20:31,319 --> 01:20:33,340
Megan.

950
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:37,740
Megan.

951
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:55,380
So...

952
01:20:56,239 --> 01:20:58,300
...Megan's sick.

953
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:01,020
She's got cancer.

954
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:05,980
Can't they cure her?

955
01:21:07,439 --> 01:21:09,198
They did.

956
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:11,078
Twice.

957
01:21:11,079 --> 01:21:12,900
It came back.

958
01:21:13,319 --> 01:21:15,900
Can't they cure her again?

959
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:29,180
Is Megan gonna die?

960
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:40,540
Can I see her?

961
01:21:41,399 --> 01:21:44,260
Tom, she wants to go home.

962
01:22:23,319 --> 01:22:27,599
- Hey, listen. Thanks a lot.
- Of course.

963
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,980
- Let me know if anything changes, okay?
- Yep.

964
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:34,180
See you.

965
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:38,860
- Drive safely.
- Yeah.

966
01:23:01,439 --> 01:23:04,879
Hey, hey, hey. Stop it. Stop it.
What are you doing?

967
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:07,719
Hey, hey. Come here. Look at me.
Look at me. Look at me.

968
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:10,278
- What's going on? What's going on?
- Let go! Let go!

969
01:23:10,279 --> 01:23:11,919
- No!
- Hey, hey, hey.

970
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,519
- Take it easy.
- I can't be here.

971
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:16,398
- What? What are you talking about?
- I can't. I'm bad.

972
01:23:16,399 --> 01:23:18,780
You're ba- What did you do?
What did you do?

973
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:22,118
I told the principal
that my mom was dead.

974
01:23:22,119 --> 01:23:25,719
- You lied? Is that what you did?
- Yes. I shouldn't have.

975
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:30,519
- God's punishing me. I killed her.
- What are you talking about?

976
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:33,278
- She shouldn't have gone that day.
- No, no, no.

977
01:23:33,279 --> 01:23:36,118
- God's not punishing anybody.
- Megan is gonna die too now.

978
01:23:36,119 --> 01:23:38,358
Hey, look at me. Look at me.
Look at me.

979
01:23:38,359 --> 01:23:40,599
Megan was sick long before
you ever got here.

980
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:46,118
- I shouldn't have let her out.
- No. Take it easy. Just take it easy.

981
01:23:46,119 --> 01:23:49,879
I was on the tracks, and I tried.
Mom.

982
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:51,599
- Davey.
- Mom, I'm so sorry.

983
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:55,559
- Davey.
- I shouldn't have let you die.

984
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:57,679
It's okay. It's all right. It's all right.

985
01:23:57,680 --> 01:24:00,198
- God is punishing me.
- No, you did the right thing.

986
01:24:00,199 --> 01:24:01,519
You did the right thing.

987
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:07,118
Look. Listen to me.
It's okay. It's not your fault.

988
01:24:07,119 --> 01:24:09,620
- You di-
- Megan's dying now.

989
01:24:10,359 --> 01:24:15,438
- Because she's sick.
- No. God's punishing me.

990
01:24:15,439 --> 01:24:16,820
Easy, kid.

991
01:24:19,279 --> 01:24:22,500
It's not your fault, okay?

992
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:40,460
Here you go.

993
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:03,060
Why don't you go see Megan now?

994
01:26:19,279 --> 01:26:21,820
Come sit by me.

995
01:26:33,239 --> 01:26:36,580
I wish we had more time.

996
01:26:38,359 --> 01:26:44,220
I would like to take care of you
a little bit longer.

997
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:53,180
You know, if you think really hard,
maybe you could stay longer.

998
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:01,180
I love you, Davey.

999
01:27:03,840 --> 01:27:06,380
And I will stay with you.

1000
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:09,980
I will. Forever.

1001
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,620
Right here.

1002
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:17,620
I love you too, Megan.

1003
01:28:10,319 --> 01:28:13,318
- Promise.
- Anything.

1004
01:28:13,319 --> 01:28:19,340
To fight for him.
He is so much like you.

1005
01:28:23,039 --> 01:28:25,220
Whatever you want.

1006
01:28:27,119 --> 01:28:29,020
Promise.

1007
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:32,820
I promise.

1008
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:17,060
Oh, Meg.

1009
01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:24,020
She's gone.

1010
01:30:39,199 --> 01:30:40,959
Hey.

1011
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:44,238
You remember that lady, Renee?

1012
01:30:44,239 --> 01:30:46,140
The social worker?

1013
01:30:46,279 --> 01:30:47,900
Yeah.

1014
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:51,100
I think we need to go see her.

1015
01:30:51,439 --> 01:30:52,940
Why?

1016
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:57,799
Well, you can't hide forever,
you know?

1017
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:00,959
And you need to go to school...

1018
01:31:00,960 --> 01:31:05,020
...and be a kid again.

1019
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:09,340
Hey, listen.

1020
01:31:09,359 --> 01:31:14,740
I want you to know
that whatever happens...

1021
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:17,180
...we're in this together.

1022
01:31:19,479 --> 01:31:22,380
- Okay?
- Okay.

1023
01:31:22,479 --> 01:31:24,340
Okay.

1024
01:31:28,439 --> 01:31:31,580
So you ready to see
how that engine of yours does?

1025
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:38,060
All right. Hit it.

1026
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:03,420
Okay, pick up a little speed.

1027
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:06,679
There you go.

1028
01:32:06,680 --> 01:32:09,140
Okay, back it off just a little.

1029
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:15,500
Yeah. Not bad.

1030
01:32:15,960 --> 01:32:18,220
Not bad at all.
