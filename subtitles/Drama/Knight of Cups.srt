<i>But the soul lost its wings
and fell to Earth.</i>

103
00:13:36,714 --> 00:13:38,796
<i>There it took an earthly body.</i>

104
00:13:38,995 --> 00:13:41,839
<i>And now, while it lives in this body,</i>

105
00:13:41,995 --> 00:13:45,158
<i>no outward sign of wings can be seen.</i>

106

<i>Yet the roots of its wings are still there.</i>

107
00:13:48,635 --> 00:13:52,321
<i>And the nature of wings is to try to raise
the earthbound body</i>

<i>and soar with it into heaven.</i>

109

<i>When we see a beautiful woman, or a man...</i>

110

<i>the soul remembers the beauty
it used to know in heaven.</i>

111
00:14:05,915 --> 00:14:11,126
<i>And wings begin to spout,
and that makes the soul want to fly,</i>

122
00:14:51,397 --> 00:14:54,765
you don't have to worry about it.
Here's what happens. That goes away.

We said there's no way you're gonna do it.

127
00:15:08,638 --> 00:15:12,245
So what'd we do? Said, double your quote.
And he did it.

128
00:15:12,718 --> 00:15:16,404
And that, Chuck signed off of that.
Teddy gets who he wants.

129
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:18,641
The biggest comedy star wants you.

130
00:15:18,798 --> 00:15:23,247
Five years ago you came to me and
wanted to write big movies in Hollywood.

- I mean...
- Okay, I don't want to see.

132
00:15:27,879 --> 00:15:32,043
(agent 1) Moments like this

133
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,281
<i>(Della) I see how you look at me.</i>

134

<i>Make you suffer?</i>

137
00:16:30,442 --> 00:16:36,688
I think you're weak.

138
00:16:48,162 --> 00:16:49,687
<i>You don't want love.</i>

139

Am I bringing you back to life?

144

<i>(Della) Lave and do what you like.</i>

We're not leading the lives

<i>I hated him, too.</i>

211

<i>Find it.</i>

next week. Have you ever heard of that?</i>

323
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:25,659
<i>You're here for 20 seconds and then,
wham, you're out. You're in another room.</i>

324
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:29,371
Your wife. You're in another one.
You oughtta do that.

325
00:37:29,531 --> 00:37:33,252
Have you been to Sarajevo?
I have prayed, man,

326
00:37:33,411 --> 00:37:39,339
for God to take my arm, take both arms.
I felt so useless.

327
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:41,255
What's your name?

328
00:37:41,411 --> 00:37:44,335

(British man) Dear friend.

332

<i>I wonder where I was in all that time.</i>

333
00:38:26,653 --> 00:38:28,223
<i>A sleepwalker.</i>

334

<i>In love with the world,

<i>Mum The world's a swamp.</i>

<i>You have to fly over it.</i>

<i>(Nancy) You changed.</i>

344
00:39:40,296 --> 00:39:41,866
<i>The world absorbed you.</i>

345
00:39:48,057 --> 00:39:49,582
<i>More and more.</i>

346
00:39:58,856 --> 00:40:01,587
<i>I regret that it turned out the way it did.</i>

347

<i>You always wanted to get away.
I wanted a mate.</i>

348

<i>I couldn't have you.</i>

349
00:40:12,257 --> 00:40:14,100
<i>Just didn't wanna be alone.</i>

350
00:40:32,978 --> 00:40:35,504
Are you sorry that you brought me here?

351
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:42,263
Are you sorry you came?

352
00:40:44,058 --> 00:40:48,746
(Nancy) Do you remember how happy we were?
Different these days.

353
00:40:51,218 --> 00:40:52,902
What's going on with you?

354
00:40:55,539 --> 00:41:00,022
(Nancy) You used to sing in the morning
coming down the stairs.

355
00:41:02,179 --> 00:41:05,308
I meant to make you happy.
I wanted nothing else.

356
00:41:06,579 --> 00:41:09,230
But then you began to be angry with me...

357
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,184
just for little things.

358
00:41:15,699 --> 00:41:20,068
<i>(Nancy) I don't wanna accuse you,
bu! you turned more unkind toward me.</i>

359
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,990
<i>Almost cruel.</i>

360
00:41:37,181 --> 00:41:40,071
Just don't threaten me with leaving, okay?

361
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:41,910
Just do what you wanna do!

362
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,304
Just go!

Mine.</i>

<i>Ambition.</i>

<i>Fear.</i>

<i>Your head was turned

Can you move all your fingers?

384
00:44:12,426 --> 00:44:14,906
Yeah, they look a little bit bruised.

385

(string music continues)

386
00:44:36,427 --> 00:44:40,910
<i>(Nancy) You never really wanted
to be totally inside our marriage.</i>

387

<i>Nor outside it, either.</i>

388
00:44:53,989 --> 00:44:56,799
<i>You were sincere in the promises you made.</i>

<i>Afraid of life.</i>

<i>Should I tell you that?</i>

410
00:49:03,758 --> 00:49:07,240
(agent 1) Drinking is bad.
Bu! feelings are worse.

411
00:49:07,398 --> 00:49:11,084
Sober girls are the worst,
but so are really drunk ones.

412
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:14,281
The sweet spot is one xanie,

You worked long and hard

Freedom.
What are you gonna do?

423
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:03,767
Crawl back down because
you don't like the altitude?

I wanna make you rich.

Is there anyone you wanna sit
in a room with?

429
00:50:24,161 --> 00:50:28,883
<i>(Herb) Is there anyone you wanna know?

<i>Don't get your head

They didn't count the pros

I gave my life up for you kids.

447
00:51:48,525 --> 00:51:53,406
It wasn't a noble sacrifice.
It was what we were supposed to do.

01:15:18,260 --> 01:15:21,343
to be no part of the world
nor of the things in it.

636
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:25,983
But my eyes are now simple,
and I'm carnal when I see beautiful women

637
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:29,826
and big cars and lots of money,
and I wanna be a part of it.

638
01:15:35,021 --> 01:15:38,628
(Karen) I mean, who needs a bed
this big? Pretty good, huh?

639
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:40,305
Look at you,

640
01:15:40,501 --> 01:15:45,189
hanging out there with your girls and your
money. Are you feeling happy?

641
01:15:45,381 --> 01:15:47,110
- Yes.
- It makes you happy?

642
01:15:47,301 --> 01:15:52,182
- (man) It depends who owns the money.
- It's my new fur. He bought it for me.

643
01:15:53,581 --> 01:15:55,390
This man is in love with me.

644
01:15:55,541 --> 01:15:57,270
Just some other girl.

645
01:15:57,422 --> 01:15:58,992
- Hi, how are you?
- Hi.

646
01:16:13,822 --> 01:16:16,268
<i>(Rick) And the world held up a mirror.</i>

647
01:16:16,422 --> 01:16:18,106
(woodwind music)

648
01:16:18,262 --> 01:16:19,832
<i>Here.</i>

649
01:16:21,262 --> 01:16:22,946
<i>Take the things you want.</i>

650
01:16:29,303 --> 01:16:30,953
<i>They can be yours.</i>

651
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:48,033
<i>Why do you hold back?</i>

652
01:16:54,704 --> 01:16:57,105
(Karen) I thought you were dead.

653
01:16:57,263 --> 01:17:01,587
- I can't believe I actually met Elvis.
- You never know in this town.

654
01:17:01,704 --> 01:17:05,345
That's my move.
Do you think I'll be as famous as Elvis?

655
01:17:12,345 --> 01:17:14,427
(woodwind music continues)

656
01:17:23,905 --> 01:17:25,634
<i>(narrator) What a fool am I?</i>

657
01:17:25,784 --> 01:17:29,027
<i>Just to fie in a stinking dungeon.</i>

658
01:17:30,985 --> 01:17:33,192
<i>When I may as well walk a! liberty.</i>

659
01:17:34,465 --> 01:17:38,436
<i>I have a key in my bosom called promise.</i>

660
01:17:40,705 --> 01:17:42,275
<i>And will I am persuaded,</i>

661
01:17:43,145 --> 01:17:45,989
<i>open any lock in Doubting Castle.</i>

662
01:17:47,825 --> 01:17:50,305
<i>Though in this dark and dismal state,</i>

663
01:17:51,426 --> 01:17:55,033
<i>he hath turned the shadow
of death into the morning,</i>

664
01:18:05,746 --> 01:18:07,874
<i>(music fades out)</i>

665
01:18:12,506 --> 01:18:14,588
(silent)

666
01:18:23,387 --> 01:18:25,515
(ominous, unearthly tones)

667
01:19:06,749 --> 01:19:08,274
(Rick) Go,

668
01:19:15,149 --> 01:19:16,958
<i>Where?</i>

669
01:19:32,150 --> 01:19:33,800
<i>Find it.</i>

670
01:19:46,070 --> 01:19:48,152
(unearthly tones continue)

671
01:19:51,470 --> 01:19:52,995
<i>How do I reach you?</i>

672
01:20:00,711 --> 01:20:02,281
<i>Find my way there?</i>

673
01:20:21,152 --> 01:20:23,758
(monotonous trombone-like tone)

674
01:20:46,472 --> 01:20:48,156
<i>(Isabel) Are you afraid?</i>

675
01:21:06,874 --> 01:21:10,321
(deep, growling tone)

676
01:21:31,074 --> 01:21:33,361
<i>(Elizabeth) Sweetheart, my lave,</i>

677
01:21:33,514 --> 01:21:37,280
<i>I don't feel guilty
that I've fallen in love with you.</i>

678
01:21:42,075 --> 01:21:43,600
<i>I'm glad.</i>

679
01:21:45,195 --> 01:21:47,243
<i>Grateful I still can.</i>

680
01:21:57,035 --> 01:22:00,596
<i>(Elizabeth) You're afraid
you're making me break my vows.</i>

681
01:22:05,475 --> 01:22:08,285
<i>But the vow comes out
of the love behind it.</i>

682
01:22:12,835 --> 01:22:15,315
<i>Love's so rare that when you find it</i>

683
01:22:17,276 --> 01:22:18,846
<i>you can't doubt it.</i>

684
01:22:21,556 --> 01:22:23,126
<i>Let it go.</i>

685
01:22:44,757 --> 01:22:46,839
(they laugh)

686
01:22:51,918 --> 01:22:56,128
<i>(Christopher) I remember when
I came down out of the mountains</i>

687
01:22:56,237 --> 01:22:59,923
<i>and I was conditioned with
being absolutely clear.</i>

688
01:23:00,078 --> 01:23:01,603
<i>Absolutely...</i>

689
01:23:02,838 --> 01:23:06,160
<i>if not enlightened,
at least wiser than I had been.</i>

690
01:23:07,198 --> 01:23:12,238
You have to kneel in a certain way and
you have to bow at the appropriate time.

691
01:23:12,399 --> 01:23:17,087
And it's all beautifully timed,
even the sound of when they announce...

692
01:23:32,599 --> 01:23:36,684
We walked 250 miles over the mountains,

693
01:23:36,839 --> 01:23:39,206
into Tibet area.

694
01:23:39,959 --> 01:23:44,009
And every... couple days,

695
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:45,685
every 20 miles or so,

696
01:23:46,519 --> 01:23:50,444
you knew you were
going back in history, in time...

697
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:52,762
(indistinct)

698
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:57,044
But don't forget
their life is so circumscribed.

699
01:23:57,200 --> 01:24:02,809
If you're living in a cave eating nettles,
it's not so difficult to keep life simple.

700
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:09,129
You don't have honking horns and your wife
running in saying "You screwed up!"

701
01:24:09,321 --> 01:24:14,805
The distractions are very few, and that's
the great attraction of the monk's life.

702
01:24:16,361 --> 01:24:20,047
<i>(Christopher)
Teaching now... I only teach one thing.</i>

703
01:24:22,001 --> 01:24:24,288
<i>I just teach this moment.</i>

704
01:24:26,201 --> 01:24:28,647
<i>Pay attention to this moment.</i>

705
01:24:31,362 --> 01:24:33,205
<i>And everything is there...</i>

706
01:24:35,881 --> 01:24:37,371
<i>perfect...</i>

707
01:24:39,882 --> 01:24:41,452
<i>and complete.</i>

708
01:24:44,522 --> 01:24:46,047
<i>Just as it is.</i>

709
01:24:46,202 --> 01:24:48,808
(rattling of countless marbles)

710
01:25:14,003 --> 01:25:15,971
(Elizabeth) You're so <i>quiet.</i>

711
01:25:18,124 --> 01:25:20,331
<i>You keep everything to yourself.</i>

712
01:25:27,124 --> 01:25:28,694
<i>You have love in you.</i>

713
01:25:30,683 --> 01:25:32,253
<i>I know it.</i>

714
01:25:39,884 --> 01:25:41,454
<i>When I'm with you...</i>

715
01:25:42,764 --> 01:25:44,812
<i>I forget everything else.</i>

716
01:25:50,365 --> 01:25:52,333
<i>My husband...</i>

717
01:25:53,444 --> 01:25:55,014
<i>my life as I knew it.</i>

721
01:26:26,606 --> 01:26:28,176
<i>Can it be?</i>

01:26:28,966 --> 01:26:31,048

727
01:27:23,408 --> 01:27:24,978
<i>(Rick) Answer me.</i>

728

<i>So this is what we are.</i>

729
01:27:40,369 --> 01:27:41,894
<i>A fire.</i>

736
01:29:21,093 --> 01:29:22,618
Open your mouth.

738
01:29:44,934 --> 01:29:47,301
<i>(Rick) I wanna go away with you.</i>

739
01:29:59,735 --> 01:30:01,305
<i>Marry you.</i>

740
01:30:46,736 --> 01:30:49,182
<i>(Rick) Save what you can of your life.</i>

741
01:30:51,336 --> 01:30:52,906
<i>Look at me.</i>

742

<i>Don't lose it all

(exhales)

756
01:33:03,302 --> 01:33:05,191

757
01:33:12,702 --> 01:33:17,788
She's like "I had four of them.
You have to get over it and stop crying."

<i>That never gets out.</i>

<i>(Joseph) Have mercy an me.</i>

<i>by a way you cannot see.</i>

778

If you are unhappy, you shouldn't
take it as a mark of God's disfavor.

779
01:38:39,995 --> 01:38:44,637
Just the contrary.
Might be the very sign He loves you.

780
01:38:44,795 --> 01:38:49,483
He shows His love
not by helping you avoid suffering,

781
01:38:49,635 --> 01:38:52,844
by sending you suffering,

782
01:38:55,635 --> 01:38:57,205
<i>by keeping you there.</i>

783
01:39:01,155 --> 01:39:04,762
To suffer binds you to something
higher than yourself,

784

higher than your own will.

785

Takes you from the world
