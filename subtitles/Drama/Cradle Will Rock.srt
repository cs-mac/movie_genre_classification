1
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,100
You can roll it!

2
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,000
Italy stands poised to invade Ethiopia...

3
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,000
under the leadership
of Benito Mussolini.

4
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,800
In a speech to thousands of supporters
last week, Mussolini recalled...

5
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,400
the glory of Roman empires past,

6
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,800
calling on his supporters to join with him
to reclaim lands rightfully belonging to them.

7
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,600
Facing Mussolini's highly mobilized war
machine is Haile Selassie of Ethiopia,

8
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,600
who must rely on high-spirited
but poorly armed tribal forces...

9
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,400
to defend his monarchy.

10
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,500
In a concerted effort to rid Germany of
what he views as degenerate influences,

11
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,300
Chancellor Adolph Hitler last week
opened an exhibition of condemned art.

12
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,000
A dabbler in oils
and water colors himself,

13
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:20,400
Chancellor Hitler said in a statement that
he is not anti-art but anti-decadence...

14
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,600
and despises art that portrays Germany
in a negative and unsympathetic fashion.

15
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,500
Here at home, American spirits continue
to rebound from economic hard times...

16
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,000
with jobs made possible
by Washington, D. C.

17
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,200
Fear is vanishing...

18
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,500
and confidence is growing
on every side.

19
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,500
With the press of a button, Roosevelt puts
into operation the Tennessee Valley Dam,

20
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,100
a monumental accomplishment
that provides flood control...

21
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,100
and electricity to the southern states.

22
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,700
Another stunning achievement made possible
by the millions of unemployed men and women...

23
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,300
put back to work by
the Works Progress Administration.

24
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,700
Things are looking up
indeed for Americans,

25
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,300
as we look to the future
with hope and high vision.

26
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,500
Fashion designers for years have competed
for the attention and discerning eye...

27
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,300
of the female consumer.

28
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,600
Everything from bathing suits to evening
gowns have been designed for the female form.

29
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,700
- But what aboutjunior?
- Hey, Dave, is that you?

30
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,000
Children's fashion was the star
in Miami, Florida, this week.

31
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,200
Everything from underwear to evening
wear graced the tiny runways...

32
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,300
as discerning children took notice
of the threads coming their way.

33
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,900
Better not ask this little guy
to wear a tie. Mommy!

34
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:27,900
If dog is man's best friend, then
perhaps the cat is this lady's chum.

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,800
A very large cat indeed. 

36
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,500
The Magnificent Wanda
and her lion, Kitty, 

37
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,100
helped initiate the Federal Theater's
circus project last week. 

38
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,500
The latest in a series
of low-cost entertainments... 

39
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:42,000
produced by the maverick
W. P. A. program. 

40
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,400
- Hey!
- Vaudeville, Shakespeare and lion tamers. 

41
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:50,100
Brought to you by Uncle Sam,
courtesy of the W. P. A. 

42
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,700
And stay out, you runt!

43
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,900
Each little tear and sorrow

44
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,700
Only brings you closer to me

45
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,500
Just wait until tomorrow

46
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,700
What a happy day that will be

47
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,800
- Song for a nickel, mister?
- What?

48
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,100
- I'll sing you a song for a nickel.
- No, thank you.

49
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,700
Somewhere the sun is shining

50
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:24,100
So, honey don't you cry

51
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,700
Closer to me

52
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,000
just wait until tomorrow

53
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,300
What a happy day that will be

54
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,000
Come up to my room

55
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,500
Jesus

56
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:05,800
I ain't in Steeltown long

57
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,300
I work two days a week

58
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:14,500
The other five
my efforts ain't required

59
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,700
For two days out of seven

60
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,200
Two dollar bills I'm given

61
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,800
So I'm just searchin'

62
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,800
Along the street

63
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,900
For on those five days

64
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,500
Five days

65
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,000
For on those five days

66
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,400
For on those five days

67
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,300
It's nice to eat

68
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,900
Jesus

69
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,200
Jesus

70
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,800
Who said
let's eat

71
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,400
Titanic.
It was amazing. It was...

72
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,500
So, it was the most exciting
thing in my life.

73
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,400
- Negroes, dear?
- Yes, Negroes.

74
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,300
- All Negroes?
- All Negroes, dear.

75
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,900
- It was a minstrel show?
- No. Macbeth. 

76
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,800
I said it before.
Macbeth. Shakespeare. 

77
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,700
- With Negroes?
- Yes.

78
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,300
Carlo says it's unlucky
to say Macbeth in the theater. 

79
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,900
- So what do they call it? What is it, Carlo?
- "The Scottish play. "

80
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,500
Yes, the Scottish play, but there isn't
anything Scottish in this production.

81
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,800
I don't know a lot of Negro Scots.

82
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:44,000
Oh, Gray dear,
you don't know a lot of Negro anything.

83
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,900
Madame?

84
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,600
Oh, dear. I know.
I had a call last night.

85
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,500
- Not you, thank God.
- What is?

86
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,700
Steel strike. Labor riots.

87
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:00,200
Well, the reception for
the Italian exhibit is today, noon.

88
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,600
- Italian exhibit at noon.
- Please don't be late.

89
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,200
- Carlo and I are going to see a theatrical producer today.
- Mm, theatrical producer?

90
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,000
- To learn about the artistic process.
- Artistic process?

91
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,500
- Yes.
- What time is the exhibit?

92
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,600
Noon.

93
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,400
I'll be there, darling.

94
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,500
- Dad, when is Mommy coming home?
- In a couple of days.

95
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,800
- "Churn. "
- C-H-U-R-N.

96
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,000
- What's the baby's name?
- "Person. "

97
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,500
- P-E-R-S-O-N.
- What's the baby's name?

98
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,000
- Antonio. You like that?
- Yeah.

99
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,500
- A-I-N-T-I-N-O?
- What?

100
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,300
Excuse me, miss.
Is this line for to get job?

101
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,900
- I think so.
- I am carpenter. I work with my hands.

102
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,500
- It is good government wants to build.
- Yeah.

103
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,300
- I build with wood. What you do?
- Yeah?

104
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,800
I think this might be the wrong line.
This line is for theater.

105
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,300
- It's for actors and musicians, I believe.
- You're actress?

106
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,800
Yeah. Is this the right line
for the Federal Theater Project?

107
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,000
I think this is
the line for everything.

108
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,500
- Are there other lines?
- There's other lines inside.

109
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,500
- Are there lines for theater jobs inside?
- I believe so.

110
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,200
- I work anywhere. I dig ditches, pour slag, act.
- Flanagan?

111
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,400
- Does not matter.
- Mrs. Flanagan!

112
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:17,200
Mrs. Flanagan.

113
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,000
- Aren't you Hallie Flanagan?
- Yes. Mr...

114
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,700
- Beaver. I'm a beaver.
- Mr. Beaver, what can I do for you?

115
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,900
Well, I'm completely embarrassed,
but I heard you'd be here today,

116
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,100
and I'm a playwright,
and I've written a children's play.

117
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,800
It's called Revolt Of the Beavers,
and I want to know if you'd read it. 

118
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,000
- Absolutely. You have to fill out submission forms.
- I did. They're all inside.

119
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,500
It's got great music. I'd be happy
to play it for you. I-I'll be back.

120
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,800
They say, "Okay, we want to do what you do. "
I say, "Fine. Take 30 years. 

121
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,200
Do nothing else,
and then maybe. "

122
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,100
I am not a teacher.
I'm an entertainer. 

123
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,600
- What's the problem?
- Mr. Crickshaw works at the vaudeville project,

124
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,900
and he's complaining
about the policy there.

125
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,300
I'm supposed to tutor
two no-talents. It's impossible!

126
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:59,400
Mr. Crickshaw, we were hoping that you
would introduce young people to vaudeville... 

127
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,700
and encourage them to take it up
and prolong its life.

128
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,700
"Prolong its life"?

129
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,000
Vaudeville will be around long
after you and your Communists are.

130
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,900
Hallie, you have
a meeting.

131
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,900
Two Chinese gentlemen
in native dress came by last night,

132
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,100
want you to start
a Chinese theater.

133
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,700
Very polite. They'll come again.
Also, you got a call yesterday...

134
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,800
saying that we can't hire an elephant
for the Brooklyn circus.

135
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,700
- Why not?
- They're not eligible for relief.

136
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,800
- Hallie. Welcome home. How was your trip?
- Great.

137
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,900
- I have wonderful things to report.
- Did you hear about the elephant?

138
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,800
- Not eligible for relief.
- Also, a guy in a squirrel outfit's been trying to see you.

139
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:35,800
- Beaver. He's a beaver, a playwright.
- What? Oh, playwright.

140
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,700
Also, there's trouble
in Minnesota.

141
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,700
Seems an ex-fan dancer auditioned
for the Federal Theater there.

142
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,300
- Fan dancer?
- Burlesque, takes her clothes off, you know.

143
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,200
So she auditions, doesn't get the job,
but the papers run a photo of her...

144
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,700
- saying the Federal Theater...
- Is now employing strippers.

145
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,600
- Pierre!
- Hello, darling.

146
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,300
I trust you're not too tired
from touring the U. S. A.

147
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,000
I have seen such great theater.
So inspiring.

148
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,900
- Have you heard the rumors?
- About the stripper?

149
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,600
Stripper, no. People from Washington
snooping around our files.

150
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,300
- All this talk about Congressman Dies.
- Dies as in death?

151
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,400
- Something about a subcommittee.
- No. It's news to me. Hello, everybody!

152
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,300
Go stand on someone's neck

153
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,300
While you're takin'

154
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:17,600
Cut into somebody's throat
as you put

155
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,000
For every dream and scheme's

156
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,900
Depending on whether

157
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,600
All through the storm

158
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,100
You've kept it warm

159
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,400
The nickel under your foot

160
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,900
Who's singing?

161
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,400
A prostitute. She's starving.
She sells herself for food.

162
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,100
She thinks she feels
a nickel under her foot,

163
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,700
but when she reaches for it,
there's nothing there.

164
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,900
She's that... hungry.
You hate that, don't you?

165
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,500
I didn't say that.
I didn't say anything.

166
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,900
I... I'm not here. 

167
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You haven't slept in two days.
Go to sleep. 

168
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,100
- Ooh! Oh. I'm so sorry.
- Ooh! Oh!

169
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:25,100
- Are you all right?
- Yes. Oh!

170
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,100
Oh!

171
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,100
- Countess!
- Jack! Jack, I found the play charming. 

172
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,300
Utterly darling. And the idea of setting
the Scottish play in the Caribbean.

173
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,600
- Ah, yes.
- Carlo commented afterward he'd never seen anything like it. 

174
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,500
And he's from Vienna,
you know. 

175
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,900
I would be very interested to cultivate a
relationship with yourself, Mr. Welles and Carlo.

176
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,500
- What's the name of your opera, dear?
- Le Cordonier Desespere.

177
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,400
The Cobbler In Despair. He sings
passages from it to me all the time. 

178
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,700
- He can't seem to get it out of his head.
- Yes.

179
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,600
- Poor Carlo. Such a sad man.
- Shh!

180
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,000
His store of pleasures
must be sauced with pain!

181
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:03,500
Now, worthy Faustus,
methinks your looks are changed.

182
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,600
- Gentlemen.
- What ails Faustus?

183
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,300
Look, sirs, comes he not?
Comes he not?

184
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,700
Yet, Faustus, look up to Heaven. 

185
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,200
- Hey, cue lightning! Goddamn it, Abe.
- Cue lightning!

186
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,200
That's late. If the cue is late,
it will get a laugh.

187
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,000
We do not need this laugh.
It's a stupid, embarrassing laugh.

188
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,500
Concentrate, folks.
Now, do it again.

189
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,300
Yet, Faustus,
look up to Heaven!

190
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,200
Which one
is Mr. Welles?

191
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,600
He's the, um, ranting madman
with the Blue Boy wig.

192
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,300
I gave up my soul
for my cunning.

193
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,700
That's my cue.

194
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,600
- It's not your line.
- What's my line?

195
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,500
- It's Bert's line. Bert, say your line.
- No, it's his.

196
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,500
- Say the line!
- Oh, God forbid!

197
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,200
- Oh, God forbid!
- Break time. Break time!

198
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,600
Union break! Fifteen minutes!

199
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,100
The date is expired. The hell with
the theater, and the hell with you.

200
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,700
I've got to go have
a coffee and a fart.

201
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,100
Never mind that for the first time
in this goddamn rehearsal process...

202
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,500
we were in the middle of a discovery
essential to making the play work!

203
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,800
I... need... a smoke!

204
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,300
You're not actors,
you're smokers!

205
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,400
You wouldn't know the church of the
theater if it smacked you in the mouth!

206
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,500
- Shut up, Orson, or I'll smack you in the mouth.
- Fuck you, john!

207
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,100
You're not a believer,
you're a worker.

208
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,800
Damn right. And you're not a director.
you're a dictator!

209
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,300
You're atheists!
You have no respect for the theater!

210
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,500
This isn't a game!
This isn't a goddamn cocktail party!

211
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,500
- This is work! It's hard work!
- Blah, blah, blah, blah. 

212
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,200
And if you're not willing
to give your blood to it,

213
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,900
then it isn't worth it
because you'll never make theater...

214
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,300
with your coffee klatch
union breaks.

215
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,900
You will make...
pageants...

216
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,800
without truth,
without soul!

217
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,800
Bloodless,
sweatless, shallow,

218
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,500
lily-white pageants...

219
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,500
signifying nothing!

220
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,900
I'm going, Jack!

221
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You can give them a two-hour-long smoke.
We'll pick up... 

222
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,900
with the Seven Deadly Sins.

223
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,600
Right!
He has his moments. 

224
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,500
He is busto,
multidissimo. 

225
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,300
It's so fascinating. I've always wanted
to observe the process of art-making.

226
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:10,900
- So what happens now?
- Now we wait for the prima donna to return.

227
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,900
- Willie!
- Sandra!

228
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,700
- Baby!
- Where have you been?

229
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,000
- Oh, good grief.
- Excuse me, Mr. Houseman?

230
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,700
- I have to go to the hospital.
- The hospital? Are you hurt?

231
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,500
- No, no, no. Hello. My wife just had a child.
- How do you do?

232
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,800
- Oh, congratulations!
- Thank you.

233
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,600
Countess, may I introduce a supporting
member of our cast... Aldo Silvano.

234
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,300
- Plays the role of, um...
- I'm the fourth scholar.

235
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,200
- Fourth scholar, yes.
- Wonderful.

236
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,800
This ain't no political meeting house.
This is a damn theater. 

237
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,800
We're not doin' nothing here but
entertaining and making people laugh.

238
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:48,600
Well, I'm making people laugh.
Get me up.

239
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,000
Mrs. Flanagan wants me to teach
those Reds how to make people laugh.

240
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:54,100
- Forget it. You?
- Nothing funny about Communists.

241
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,600
- There's nothing funny about you.
- Reds are glum, serious people.

242
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,900
- What about that Stinky Magoo? He was funny.
- He wasn't a Communist.

243
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,100
Oh, most certainly was.
As Red as a rooster's crown.

244
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,400
Melvin, you don't know what you're talking
about. Stinky Magoo was a Republican.

245
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,500
- He was Red, Tommy.
- No, he wasn't.

246
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,100
- Yes, he was.
- No, he wasn't.

247
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,600
- You would know.
- He was not a Red! Stinky Magoo was a Republican!

248
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,500
He was funny!

249
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,400
Well... he was funny.
You're right about that.

250
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,700
- God rest his soul.
- May he make God laugh.

251
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,500
Hear, hear.

252
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,500
Mr. Crickshaw,
hi-loo.

253
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,100
Uh, we are ready
for our tutorial.

254
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,900
- We're ready for our tutorial.
- We're ready to learn how to be funny. 

255
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,500
And how to do the mouth thing.

256
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:41,300
It is fantastic, this art form
that embraces the future, 

257
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:46,300
shatters convention and uses color
to create an exquisite sensuality, huh?

258
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,300
It looks all cut up.

259
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,500
- Shapes distributed geometrically.
- Exactly.

260
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,900
- What does it mean?
- It means whatever you want it to mean.

261
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,200
The Futurists, they exist
in the realm of emotion...

262
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,500
the Eros, not the intellect.

263
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,500
Ah, yes, Eros. I particularly like
the sensuality of the colors. 

264
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,700
- Mmm, mmm.
- This one has interesting colors too.

265
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,100
Well, you have a very good eye,
Mr. Mathers.

266
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,100
- Gray.
- Gray?

267
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,100
- My name, not the color.
- Ah. 

268
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,500
- Is that a Modigliani?
- Yes, it is. 

269
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,400
Nelson Rockefeller,
meet Margherita Sarfatti,

270
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,800
- cultural emissary to Premier Mussolini.
- Piacere. 

271
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,400
- Enchante.
- Delighted to see you, Nelson. 

272
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,900
Mr. Mathers. Mr. Hearst, always
a pleasure. Good to see you, Mary.

273
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,600
Premier Mussolini is very thankful
to you and your family...

274
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,200
for your generous contribution
for the museum.

275
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,400
I understand that you...
are personally responsible... 

276
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,500
for bringing
the exhibition here.

277
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,600
Well, my motives
are purely selfish, madame.

278
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,700
I've never been lucky enough
in my life...

279
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,900
to stand inches away from
a da Vinci or a Michelangelo.

280
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,900
Ah, how does it feel?

281
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,100
Extraordinary.

282
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,300
- Nelson can be very helpful in the oil department as well.
- Really?

283
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,600
There I go again
jumping the gun,

284
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,500
ruining a perfectly civil conversation
on art by getting to the point.

285
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,500
Eh, Margherita?

286
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,200
I must confess, I'm more interested in
the oil in paint than the oil in derricks.

287
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,800
Ah, bravo! Bravo!

288
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,600
- I understand you know Diego Rivera.
- Mmm.

289
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,700
Paris, wild times.

290
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,700
- I am to see him today.
- Ah.

291
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,300
- Any tips?
- Swing left, stay sober.

292
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,300
He was once a cannibal,
you know.

293
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,200
- What?
- Yes.

294
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,000
Never before has the link
between government and industry... 

295
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,600
been so obvious
and so dangerous. 

296
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:31,500
Five dead. 

297
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,300
Two shot in the back.
Twenty-seven injured... 

298
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,300
by the blackjacks and fists
of the strike breakers. 

299
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,000
And who were the attackers?

300
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,000
- Thugs? Pinkertons?
- No! No!

301
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:47,400
No, ladies and gentlemen. The murderers
last night were government employees!

302
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,000
Policemen killing and beating
the very citizens who pay their wage. 

303
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,500
Lending their nightsticks...

304
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,900
and guns to the industrialists,
to the strike breakers!

305
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,200
I think it's time... 

306
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,800
- What is your play about?
- What are your plays about? What's Threepenny Opera about?

307
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,900
- What is your play about?
- It's about a prostitute, uh, poverty.

308
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,200
That's survival. That is not enough.

309
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,100
What about
the other prostitutes?

310
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,800
You don't have to be poor to be
a whore. Look around you.

311
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:19,700
In the mansions, in the churches,
in the universities. 

312
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,100
Everyone is corruptible,
even your union leaders. 

313
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,200
- The cradle of power is rocking!
- Yeah!

314
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,300
Now who's the dummy?

315
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,700
- Now who's the dummy?
- Now who's the dummy?

316
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,400
- Now who's the dummy?
- Now who's the dummy?

317
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,200
- Now who's the dummy?
- Stop!

318
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,900
You want to use...
the back of your mouth. 

319
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,400
Try again.

320
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,700
Now who's the dummy?

321
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,400
Now... who's the dummy?

322
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,500
- Now who's the dummy?
- Now who's the dummy?

323
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,600
- Now...
- Cut!

324
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,000
Your mouth is moving.

325
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,800
If your mouth is moving,
the effect is ruined.

326
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,200
Try to keep your lips
immobile.

327
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,800
Mmm, mmm, the dummy?

328
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,500
Now who's the dummy?

329
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,400
"Federal Theater's touring show, Broadway
Bandwagon, rolled into Peoria last night, 

330
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,600
and for two hours,
gaiety and glamour... 

331
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,900
obscured thoughts of drought
and other financial worries. "

332
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:51,000
Peoria Star.
They performed Dubuque, Waterloo, 

333
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,600
Eau Claire, Sheboygan,
Wausau and Wisconsin Rapids.

334
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,000
And I saw it in a high school
in Manitowoc.

335
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,100
3,000 students seeing their first play
with live actors. It was very exciting.

336
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,500
I just got a letter from the director
of the Portland, Oregon, project.

337
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,600
Their debut was a resounding success.
Sold-out shows every night.

338
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,400
Denver's a week away from opening Rakes
Progress. That'll be Colorado's debut. 

339
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,300
- It Can't Happen Here?
- It is happening. 

340
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,800
It Can't Happen Here
is a steamroller. 

341
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,400
We have a commitment
from the Detroit project.

342
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,200
Also, the Seattle
Negro Company's in.

343
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,000
And Brooklyn is doing
a version in Yiddish.

344
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,100
Twenty-one productions of
It Can't Happen Here in 17 states. 

345
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,900
- Same play, all opening on the same day.
- Great. 

346
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,900
- A national theater, Hallie.
- Birmingham, Boston, Chicago, Detroit,

347
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,900
Newark, Bridgeport, Yonkers,
Staten Island, Tampa,

348
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,600
- Wooster, Cleveland, Los Angeles...
- That's how beavers

349
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,400
Make their living since the day
they left the ark

350
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,900
- Miami, Omaha, Seattle, San Francisco...
- And we clip, clip, clip

351
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,700
And we stack, stack, stack
And we pack, pack, pack

352
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,200
And we strip it and we clip it
and we stack it and we pack it

353
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,600
And we work, work, work
all day

354
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,200
- So did he stomp his feet?
- A couple of times.

355
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,900
He sounds like such a child.

356
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,500
Let's not talk about Orson.
Let's talk about Antonio.

357
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,400
Hmm? Antonio?

358
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,300
You don't like it?

359
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,500
I... No, I like it.

360
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,900
You're beautiful, hmm?

361
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,600
That's your mama.
She made you.

362
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,000
She's amazing.

363
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,900
You're the artist.

364
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,800
Thank you.
I take pride in my work.

365
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,600
- Your mother.
- There's only one voice like it. 

366
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,100
- I thought I'd find you in a room.
- Shh! This is a room.

367
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:24,300
A bigger room, yes. I thought
I'd find you without so many people.

368
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,800
- We couldn't afford that.
- Oh! Poverino. 

369
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,800
If your papa had a better job,
you could get a better room.

370
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:34,200
Mama, don't start. Speak good things
in front of my son, please.

371
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,000
So many people.
Someone could be sick.

372
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,000
- Say hello to Sophie.
- Hello, Sophie.

373
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
- Hello, Mama.
- Oh, look at that face.

374
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:44,300
And today I saw Mr. Welles throw
a tantrum in front of his new cast.

375
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,600
They're mostly white.
He was so passionate.

376
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,900
I'm sure.
You're late, you know.

377
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,800
Oh, have I missed much?
Have any of the paintings moved?

378
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,400
- Most of the people have.
- Look. Da Vinci.

379
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,400
- Da Vinci.
- Splendid!

380
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,400
- Hearst says that the Federal
Theater is full of Reds.

381
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,700
- Communists? I can't imagine that to be true.
- Communists?

382
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,100
- Hearst is a smart man.
- Yes, and I suppose I'm a dim woman.

383
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,200
No, no, no,
I didn't say that.

384
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,400
Could Mr. Hearst explain to me
the Communist implications...

385
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,600
of the Scottish play
in the Caribbean?

386
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,500
Ah, Margherita Sarfatti,
my wife,

387
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,700
- the perpetually late Countess La Grange.
- Charmed.

388
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,400
- Likewise.
- Buona sera. Je suis Carlo. 

389
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,200
- Oh, thank you.
- Grazie. 

390
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,500
Your husband has
an excellent eye for art.

391
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,700
You're a lucky woman
to have such a cultured man.

392
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,500
Oh, blessed really.

393
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,800
- Margherita, we must go.
- Ah. Countess.

394
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,900
- Gray.
- Miss Sarfatti. 

395
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,200
It has been a pleasure
talking to you. 

396
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,000
And you can assure your trade
representative that Mathers Steel... 

397
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,700
will put frames on Italian trucks
as long as wheels turn.

398
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,500
It will be
deeply appreciated.

399
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,600
Anything we can do to stop the spread of
Communism in Europe is in our own best interest.

400
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,200
Thank you.
Good day.

401
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,600
- Ciao.
- Countess, Gray. 

402
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,200
- Good-bye.
- Marion. 

403
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:03,000
- Did you just make a business deal?
- No, dear.

404
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,600
But you said you'd put frames
on Italian trucks.

405
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,100
That is none
of your business, dear.

406
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,700
Mr. Darwin claims that it took
100,000 years for a man to make a monk...

407
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,400
for a monk... for a man... for nature
to make a monkey out of a man.

408
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,900
That's nothing. A man can ma... A woman
can make a monkey out of a man in an hour.

409
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,800
- That's true.
- Like your wife made a monkey out of you. 

410
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,300
Melvin, people don't have to know that.

411
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:31,100
- With the merchant marine. Or was it a bricklayer?
- All right.

412
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,600
Those are my jokes
that you're butchering. My act.

413
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:39,500
I know you two probably don't
believe in personal property.

414
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,100
But this is not Russia.
This is not rice or grain.

415
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,000
It is my property,
my act. 

416
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,700
You do not do
another entertainer's act.

417
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,100
It is not... done.

418
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,300
- Understood?
- Okay. Yes, sir. 

419
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,300
Now who's the dummy?

420
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:04,700
I saw in the paper that that Welles you
work with is the voice of the Shadow.

421
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,900
- I like-a that show.
- Martha learns English from that show.

422
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
- "The Shadow knows. "
- Bravo. 

423
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:15,000
- So he's famous, right?
- Yeah, he works a lot.

424
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,600
- So he's got lots of money, right?
- Yes.

425
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,500
- So, uh... why don't you do that?
- I'd like to.

426
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,700
- So what's stopping you?
- Well, you gotta get the job.

427
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,800
Well, apply for it, huh?
You know, you wait on line for it.

428
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,100
- It doesn't work that way.
- You're lazy.

429
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,600
You gotta get up early,
wait on line.

430
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,300
Early bird catches the worm.

431
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:39,000
No, no, no, you don't wait
on line for a theater job, all right?

432
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,000
Mama, give me Antonio.

433
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,400
- You, you audition.
- Shh, shh, shh.

434
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,800
- You try out.
- Shh, shh, shh.

435
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,000
- You read, okay? Right, Antonio?
- There we go.

436
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,800
- Yeah, there we go.
- You pretend to be the character, huh?

437
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,800
- You don't wait on line.
- There you go. With his papa.

438
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,000
- I gotta go pick the kids up at school.
- They're at Vincent's today.

439
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,400
- No, no. I'm taking them to rehearsal.
- Sure?

440
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,900
Mm-hmm. All right?
Good-bye, Antonio.

441
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,200
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

442
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,100
I love you, my artist.

443
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,500
Listen

444
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,000
Here's a story

445
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:25,400
Not much fun
and not much glory

446
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,700
Low class

447
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,800
Low-down

448
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,900
The thing you never care to see

449
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,600
Until there is a showdown

450
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:39,300
One big question inside me

451
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,000
Cries

452
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,300
How many fakers

453
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,500
Peace undertakers

454
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,600
Paid strike breakers

455
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,000
How many toiling
ailing, dying

456
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,700
Piled-up bodies, brother

457
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,500
Does it take
to make... you

458
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,000
Wise

459
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,500
- It's very serious.
- Where's the irony? Where's the humor?

460
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,100
What about
the other prostitutes?

461
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,100
You're whores! You're prostitutes!

462
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,800
You're a whore!
You're a prostitute of the state!

463
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,600
The policemen are whores!
You're...

464
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,000
Bought a house, a lot
a limousine, a swanky yard

465
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,400
My champagne would fill up
any cellar

466
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,700
Oh, hum, there goes
the alarm clock

467
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,800
Gotta get up
and go to work again

468
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:34,200
Acting awfully bored
I loaned a buck from Henry Ford

469
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:37,300
Broke a date
with John D. Rockefeller

470
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,100
- Oh, hum, there goes the alarm clock
- Mr. Rivera. 

471
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,600
- Si.
- Mr. Diego Rivera?

472
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,500
- Si.
- I'm Nelson Rockefeller.

473
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,400
I bring greetings from Margherita
Sarfatti. She says she knows you.

474
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:50,900
- Yes. Paris, wild times.
- I saw her today.

475
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,200
- Yes.
- She's an exquisite woman with wonderful tastes in art.

476
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:58,300
- Would you like something to drink or something to eat?
- No.

477
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:02,600
- Frida, Senor Rockefeller.
- Madame.

478
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,000
Please come in. 

479
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,100
- So?
- So.

480
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,300
- So?
- So, um...

481
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:19,000
I've chosen your sketch
for mural composition...

482
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,500
to be included
in the... lobby...

483
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,800
of said
Rockefeller Center.

484
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:28,400
Now, as you may know, the theme for
the piece is "Man At the Crossroads,

485
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,900
Looking With Hope
and High Vision...

486
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,300
to the Choosing of
a New and Better Future. "

487
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,700
And, uh... that's
the theme of the piece,

488
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,000
and we'd just be thrilled
to death to have you do it.

489
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,100
- How much?
- 21,000.

490
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,200
All inclusive,
materials and assistants.

491
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,500
- Would you like a drink?
- Yes.

492
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,600
There is not a barkless beaver
Not in all of

493
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:06,500
Beaver Land

494
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,200
Bravo! Bravo.

495
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,700
I think children are going to love
this. When can you start rehearsing?

496
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,900
- Tomorrow.
- Rose, will you put these two beavers in motion.

497
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,800
Hallie, the opening.

498
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,500
We can't be late.
Mr. Hopkins will be there.

499
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,700
Ask Harry for
more money, Hallie.

500
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,200
- Next.
- That's me. 

501
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,600
And your name?

502
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,500
Olive Stanton.

503
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:37,200
- Your address?
- Oh, I don't have one.

504
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:42,400
- Are you currently employed?
- No, ma'am.

505
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:44,900
You are applying for work
at the Federal Theater Project.

506
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,700
What experience do you have
in the theater?

507
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,700
Oh, um... I sing
on Broadway...

508
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,000
Well, I've sung
on Broadway.

509
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,800
Mm-hmm.
Last employer?

510
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,400
- Excuse me?
- Last employer?

511
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,000
Last producer of a show you were in
so we can contact him?

512
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,000
Um...

513
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,100
he's dead.

514
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,600
His name?

515
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,100
Oh, um...

516
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,500
Mr. Smith... Minsky-Smith.

517
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,400
You've probably never heard of him.
It was in Buffalo.

518
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,700
We can check.

519
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:22,200
I'm sorry.
There wasn't any Smith.

520
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:27,200
Um... I'm just a gal
that needs a break is all.

521
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:31,600
I've been working on the street singing
for nickels, and I need a job.

522
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,300
I can sing real well,
and I'd work hard.

523
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:38,500
Sister, this program is designed for
theater professionals who are out of work.

524
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,300
We have limited resources. We can't
possibly employ all of the professionals.

525
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,500
This isn't a Busby Berkeley fantasy,
"make you a star, kid" and all that.

526
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,600
Are you strong?

527
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,100
- Ma'am?
- Are you strong?

528
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,700
- Can you lift things?
- Yes, ma'am.

529
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,100
Project 891
needs a stagehand.

530
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,500
Do you know what a stagehand does?
Completely unglamorous work.

531
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,600
Push a broom, lift scenery,
pull ropes, that sort of thing.

532
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,600
- Are you interested?
- Yes, ma'am. You bet.

533
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,900
You are not eligible for casting
in any plays. Do you understand that?

534
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:16,400
Here's the address, and report tomorrow
between 10:00 a. m. and 6:00 p. m.

535
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,900
- Oh, can I go today?
- Go bananas.

536
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,200
Thank you.

537
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:27,500
Well, sure, if you're in a coal mine
or a steel mill or a dangerous job, 

538
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,300
I can see the need
for a break every hour or so.

539
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,400
- What are you saying?
- Nothing. I'm with you, Orson.

540
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,400
- This is theater.
- We're not risking our lives here.

541
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,400
We're not pouring slag.

542
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,600
The other side of that is
20-hour days, low wages, no protection.

543
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,600
It would help if you didn't stop
rehearsal to call for breaks, john.

544
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,500
These are actors we're talking about,
not garment workers.

545
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,300
This is not the Triangle Fire.
It's a play.

546
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,400
No one is trying to oppress anyone
here. We're trying to get a show up.

547
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:54,600
- Once the show is up, well, we can work for what...
- Two! Two hours!

548
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,900
- Easy street!
- Two hours acting, eight hours lookin' for another job.

549
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,900
- What? Frank?
- No, sorry. Sorry.

550
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:04,000
Yeah. And should management insist
that we work an eight-hour day...

551
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
- once the show is up?
- Don't touch me.

552
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,400
It's ridiculous!
Hah!

553
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,700
And now, if you don't mind,
I'd like you to get back to work!

554
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,300
Bring in the puppets!

555
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,000
We're in a jail cell.
Steeltown, U. S. A.

556
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,100
Moll, our prostitute,
has been arrested.

557
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,200
She's sitting there, depressed
and hungry, when the door opens.

558
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,600
Who should walk in but the real whores,
the creme de la creme of Steeltown...

559
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,300
doctor specialist, editor of the
newspaper, president of the university,

560
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,600
- Reverend Salvation...
- And an artist or two.

561
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,900
- Don't forget, they are the biggest whores.
- Right, right, right.

562
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,800
And they're all in handcuffs. They've
all been arrested by some dolt cop...

563
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,200
who made a mistake,
thought they were union organizers.

564
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,300
Think what my people would think
if they could see me.

565
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,800
Phone to Mr. Mister
to come and bail us out.

566
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:53,400
- Who is Mr. Mister?
- He's the big cheese. He pulls the strings in Steeltown.

567
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:57,500
So Mr. Mister please take pity

568
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:01,200
Come and save
your pet committee

569
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,500
From disaster

570
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,200
- I'm coming about the leaflet.
- Yes?

571
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,800
- I'm here for the meeting.
- Come in.

572
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,700
- Tommy Crickshaw, ventriloquist.
- Oh.

573
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,700
Did you bring
your dummy?

574
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:36,800
I prefer to think of him
as a... puppet. I never leave him.

575
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,500
Well, we're just getting started,
Mr. Crickshaw. If you'll have a seat. 

576
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:48,800
Hello, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Hazel
Huffman, and I want to thank you for coming.

577
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:52,500
It is my hope that tonight
we can create a forum... 

578
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,500
where people can talk freely
without fear of recrimination. 

579
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,200
Don't worry. Powerful people
are interested in what we have to say.

580
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,900
I know for a fact
there's a certain congressman... 

581
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,700
who would like to know if problems
exist in the Federal Theater.

582
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,000
I, for one,
am ready to talk. 

583
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,700
I am Sloth.

584
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,300
... from salvation.
- I am Envy.

585
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,600
- I am Covetousness.
- I'm Pride.

586
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,800
I am Gluttony.

587
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,300
- They're scary.
- They're sins.

588
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,800
Daddy, how come
you're not doing a puppet?

589
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,000
- Mr. Welles doesn't want me to.
- What part do you play?

590
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,000
The fourth Scholar.

591
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,900
It's a very...
important role.

592
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,400
Lechery!

593
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,400
- Well, hello, my darling.
- Hi, Harry. Welcome.

594
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,300
- You know Paul Edwards.
- Yes. Hello, Hallie.

595
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,200
I'm sorry I'm late.
Bridge worker negotiations.

596
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,200
I trust Roosevelt
is treating you well.

597
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,100
Juggling three agencies,
the bureaucratic wonder: Harry Hopkins.

598
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,200
Everything from cleaning children's
teeth to controlling mosquitoes.

599
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,500
Harry, what are these whispers
I'm hearing about Congressman Dies?

600
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,500
Whispers? It's a roar.
He announces tomorrow...

601
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,800
a committee to investigate
Communism in the W. P. A.

602
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,200
- Oh, dear. Why didn't you tell me?
- I'm telling you.

603
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,300
"Un-American activities" he calls it.
I wouldn't worry.

604
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:13,000
Dies is a blowhard. This is just a bunch
of politicians looking for headlines.

605
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,400
What about
this mixed-race dating?

606
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,400
Has anyone else noticed
this happening in theater groups?

607
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,300
I have noticed that
the people in the Federal Theater...

608
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,200
hobnob always with Negroes,

609
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,500
throwing parties with them
left and right.

610
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,700
The problem that I have
personally with the W. P. A...

611
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,000
and with the arts projects
in particular...

612
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:36,400
is that they seem to be run by people
that are very elitist, very snobby-like.

613
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,300
I've noticed this too.

614
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,700
Personally, I don't think there is any room
to advance, if you don't agree with them,

615
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,300
if you're not the same as them
in politics,

616
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:55,300
if you don't have,
politics-wise, the same mind.

617
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,400
And besides,

618
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,400
Reds aren't funny.

619
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,400
I just don't think
they're funny.

620
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,400
Ooh, ooh, ooh

621
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,300
What a little moonlight
can do

622
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,200
Ooh, ooh, ooh

623
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:20,800
What a little moonlight
can do to you

624
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,800
You're in love

625
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:26,700
Your heart's a-flutterin'
all day long

626
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:30,000
You only stutter
'cause your poor tongue

627
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,500
Just will not get
outta the way

628
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,400
I... love... you

629
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:44,200
- Can I have some punch, please?
- Yes, certainly.

630
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:48,400
And the Negro had the nerve to call me
on the telephone and ask me for a date.

631
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,300
That's with
that Communist program.

632
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,500
- Social equality and race merging.
- That's right!

633
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,500
Punch, Mr. Crickshaw?

634
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,900
Yes. Thank you very much, Miss Huffman.

635
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,700
Ooh, ooh, ooh

636
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:08,400
What a little moonlight
can do

637
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,500
Wait a while
till a little moonbeam

638
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,400
Comes peepin'through

639
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,600
You'll get sold

640
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,600
You can't resist him

641
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,600
And all you've said
when you have kissed him is

642
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,500
Ooh, ooh, ooh

643
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,000
What a little moonlight
can do

644
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,600
Oh boy, oh boy, I just been grilled. 

645
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,700
- I also have been barbecued and frizzled.
- Who's that?

646
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,800
- It's Larry Foreman, the union leader.
- I like this, Marc.

647
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,800
He comes into the jail and sees
all these rich people sitting there.

648
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,400
Say, what's the whole Liberty
Committee doing in the pokey?

649
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,000
- And on the wrong side of the bars?
- That's the one you want. 

650
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,900
- He's a Red, an agitator.
- Mr. Mister tries to bribe him, but he tells him to get lost.

651
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,700
He won't sell out his union.
These people are marching on the jail.

652
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,600
Kill him! Lynch him!

653
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,400
And it's going to surround you

654
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,700
No wonder
those storm birds

655
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,700
Seem to circle
around you

656
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,000
Well, you can't climb down
and you can't sit still

657
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,000
That's a storm
that's gonna last

658
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,200
Until the final wind blows

659
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,200
And when the wind blows

660
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,700
The cradle will rock

661
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,400
Bravo!

662
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:28,500
- Well, I think it is terrific, jack.
- Thank you.

663
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:32,400
- Thank you.
- Marc, you have written something groundbreaking here.

664
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,200
Never before, to my knowledge,
has an American musical... 

665
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,500
dealt with content and social issues
and dramatic themes.

666
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:42,300
- You are reinventing musical theater.
- Wow! Thank you.

667
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,800
Orson?
Don't overdesign this.

668
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,700
- Keep it pure and keep it simple.
- You have my word, Madam Flanagan.

669
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,100
- I'll be checking in.
- Congratulations, Marc!

670
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,100
Auditions are tonight at 6:00. 

671
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:55,200
Score will be left with the pianist
if anybody wants to learn the songs.

672
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,800
- Thank you. - Augusta, you
make a reservation at Twenty-One?

673
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,800
- Yes, Orson.
- jack, Marc, come with me.

674
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,300
- Madam Flanagan, will you join us?
- At Twenty-One?

675
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,800
Whoo! It's too rich for my blood.
I can see the headlines now.

676
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,400
"Civil Servant Dining At Twenty-One
On Your Tax Dollars. "

677
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,700
- Oh, perils of officialdom.
- Orson.

678
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:13,300
- Yeah? - What role does a Negro actor
play in this all-white production?

679
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:16,100
All-white, ridiculous.
You'll play the Reverend Salvation.

680
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,100
- A white Protestant.
- In makeup.

681
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,900
In a world of Amos and Andy, you can play
a white Protestant. Makeup, my friend.

682
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,200
- Subversion!
- Quit worrying, Marc. Don't worry.

683
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,600
- Marc!
- Coming, coming. 

684
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,800
- Mr. Houseman, I'm Olive Stanton.
- I know you.

685
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,900
- You're a stagehand.
- And I'm an actress.

686
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,800
I'd like to, with your permission,
sir, if it'd be possible to audition.

687
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,400
Audition?
I don't know.

688
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,700
Are you out of your mind?
We're being investigated by Congress. 

689
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,600
- We can't do this play.
- Why not?

690
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,500
Greedy industrialist who's
brought down by the working man.

691
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,500
It's pro-union, yes,
but so is our audience.

692
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:49,000
- A stage full of marching workers trample the capitalist.
- They don't trample him.

693
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,900
- It's an attack on capitalism.
- Not at all. It's an attack on greed.

694
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,400
It's a good play. It's funny,
it's moving and the music is great.

695
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,800
- So stop fretting.
- I see glass!

696
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,700
- Glass?
- A stage of glass.

697
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,700
Yes!
Don't ask me why, but...

698
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,800
Whoa! There's something
about standing on a surface of glass...

699
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,200
the risk of it,
the potential for injury.

700
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:10,000
It'll be completely safe, of course.
Thick, safe glass!

701
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:12,500
Twenty-One Club, please. 

702
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:14,700
- The Cradle Will Rock is spectacular!
- Glass?

703
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,100
Yes. Stage of glass, yeah.
Are you Communist, Marc?

704
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,600
- Perhaps we should talk about the auditions,
- You know, are you Red?

705
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:23,100
- what we're looking for in each of the roles.
- Officially, no, Orson.

706
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,800
I'm a homosexual. That excludes
me from membership in the party.

707
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,800
I am faithful
to the ideals of the party.

708
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,700
I am faithful
to the party of ideas.

709
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,600
- No, you are faithful to the idea of a party.
- Sparkling wit, jack.

710
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,900
- I thought you were married, Marc.
- No, no. Shh!

711
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,700
- My wife passed away, uh, last year.
- Mm.

712
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,800
Diego!

713
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,900
Diego, are you getting
everything you need?

714
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,200
I need burnt
cypress embers.

715
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,500
Oh. I'll send for some.

716
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,200
You know, Diego, I think at first I was
a bit unrealistic with my expectations.

717
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,400
I am glad
you're taking your time. 

718
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,700
Certainly, Michelangelo took his time
with the Sistine Chapel. 

719
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,200
I only work three months,
not much.

720
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:04,600
Three months,
on and off.

721
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:08,000
I've come to understand a great deal
about art with this experience.

722
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,300
- Mira, vete para el carajo.
- Frida, porta te bien. 

723
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:14,200
Diego, what is that... 

724
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:17,100
emanating from the man
in the center?

725
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,200
That's a recombination of atoms,
the division of a cell.

726
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:25,900
Those are germs, bacteria, cells...
the wonders of the microscope. 

727
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,800
- That's fascinating.
- Mm. 

728
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:31,200
It's so modern.
And this large, uh...

729
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,500
Looks like a magnifying glass of
some kind? People are staring at it.

730
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,900
That's the latest invention...
the television. 

731
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:40,500
- Yes, I know television.
- Beamed visual radio.

732
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,900
Imagine the potential
for education.

733
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:46,100
And these well-dressed people
here, what is that?

734
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:48,600
What do you see?

735
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:52,300
Oh, I get it. Picasso played
this game with me too.

736
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,900
All right.

737
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,800
I see... 

738
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:59,200
high society
at a party of some kind. 

739
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,600
- That's it!
- Ha!

740
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,800
The decadent rich.
Above their heads,

741
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:06,100
that's a syphilis cell. 

742
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:08,700
Syphilis cell?
The rich in general?

743
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,000
- No. In specific.
- You're not talking about me, are you?

744
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,900
- But you don't have syphilis, do you?
- No, of course not.

745
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:16,800
No, I don't.

746
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:22,500
Up top there,
is that a war of some kind?

747
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:26,600
That's a battlefield.
Men in the holocaust of war.

748
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,700
And beneath it,

749
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,100
unemployed workers
being beaten by the police. 

750
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,400
Do you like it?

751
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,400
You can't stop the weather
not with all your dough

752
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:43,800
For when the wind blows
and when the wind blows

753
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,100
The cradle will rock

754
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,300
I gotta run.
My son's birthday.

755
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,800
I need the last audition possible
tonight, all right? Thanks.

756
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,000
- It's yours, Aldo.
- Of Honolulu

757
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Olive, isn't it?

758
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,300
Yeah.

759
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:01,500
- I'm john Adair.
- I know. You're a great actor. I've been watching you.

760
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,200
Thanks.

761
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,600
Did you like the play?

762
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,300
I liked it.
I thought it was interesting. 

763
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:12,000
Felt it could've gone farther.
Actually, I thought it was pretty silly.

764
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,600
- Where do you stand on Spain?
- Spain?

765
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:19,600
Franco or
the Loyalists?

766
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,400
Uh, I don't know. 

767
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,700
What, did you just crawl out
from under a rock?

768
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:32,300
That's a joke.
I'm sorry. I was kidding.

769
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,600
A lot of people
don't know.

770
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:39,300
Spain's being attacked by Fascists
from Italy and Nazis from Germany. 

771
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:42,200
- Bid your family toodle...
- Oh, to be young.

772
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:45,700
Unbelievable. At it again. 

773
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,600
Like bunnies,
God bless 'em.

774
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:51,500
"Oh, what a bursting out
there was, and what a blossoming...

775
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,700
when we had
all the summertime...

776
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,800
and she had
all the spring. "

777
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:00,000
- Roosevelt isn't doing a thing about it.
- Oh, okay.

778
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:02,600
That's terrible.
I don't know so much.

779
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,500
I... I had no idea.

780
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,900
- I thought that we were talking about the play.
- We were.

781
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:10,300
I liked it.
It made me think...

782
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:13,200
- Uh-oh. - about unions
and how important they are.

783
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:16,900
- Yeah.
- I guess I don't know so much about Spain, though.

784
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,700
- So I gather.
- Or politics.

785
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,800
What about dancing? How do you feel
about the wonderful world of dancing?

786
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,400
- What, here? In front of everyone?
- Why not?

787
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,900
You want to audition, don't you?
You can't be shy.

788
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,100
I'm working.

789
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,700
Union break!
Fifteen minutes!

790
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,400
John! Please. 

791
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,900
- Are you asking me to dance?
- Yes, ma'am.

792
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,100
- Then ask me.
- Miss Stanton, would you do me the honor?

793
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,900
Chocolate arms
are open like a flower

794
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:52,700
How the hell do you spell Honolulu

795
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:55,600
Junior's gonna be
a journalist

796
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,700
There's a woman there who wants you

797
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,900
La-la, la la la la

798
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,300
- Whoo!
- La-la, la la la la

799
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:11,000
Have you been to Honolulu

800
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:15,900
- Gee, fellas, am I supposed to be impressed?
- Ah, no, no, no.

801
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,100
Temptations of Satan, Marc.

802
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,000
Calling me
Satan, jack?

803
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:23,600
So, uh, what, you'll fill my belly
with rich foods and fine wines,

804
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:27,900
and in my sated state, I'll give myself
over to Orson Welles and his stage of glass?

805
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,200
- Is that it?
- No, I'm not talking about me.

806
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,400
I'm talking about
the follies of politics.

807
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,300
We can discuss it
over a frankfurter, if you like.

808
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,700
- Orson, discuss the play.
That is why we're here. 

809
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,800
- What is the prevailing wisdom here?
- Sometime next month.

810
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,000
The League of Nations
is applying pressure.

811
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:47,200
- Yes. Suddenly, everybody cares about Ethiopia.
- Ha!

812
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:51,200
Suddenly, Haile Selassie
is an intelligent, rational leader.

813
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,100
Doing business with you has
been so important to Mussolini.

814
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,000
An embargo, it would be
so harmful to our cause.

815
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,100
Another example of rampant socialism
run amok in this administration.

816
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,600
Well, perhaps
we could ship product now...

817
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:06,100
and stockpile in anticipation
of the worst.

818
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:08,300
Stockpile?

819
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,800
- Ah.
- jack.

820
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,600
- Let's talk about prostitution and your connection with it.
- Well, do you have evidence?

821
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,600
- Not of the loins, my boy. Of the soul.
- Oh, boy!

822
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:23,700
- How was Cradle Will Rock?
- Very good, funny. 

823
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,000
- It's a nightmare.
- Nightmare? Why?

824
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,900
Pro-union.
How's the inquisition going?

825
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I just don't understand. All these
people testifying sound nuts, loony.

826
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:35,800
Well, take notes. Are the reviews for
The Revolt of the Beavers in?

827
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,800
- No.
- Let me know when they come.

828
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:40,000
But she is
a representative of the party...

829
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,900
and they hobnob indiscriminately
with them,

830
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,400
throwing parties with them
right and left.

831
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,400
Did you report it to Trudy Goodrich?

832
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:51,800
Yes. She said she felt very
sorry that I felt that way about it,

833
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:55,800
because she personally encouraged
Negro attention on all occasions... 

834
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:58,900
and went out with them or
with any Negro who asked her to. 

835
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,700
They're getting it all wrong. Their
emphasis is on morals, not politics.

836
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,100
Don't they understand everybody lusts?
They're not...

837
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:08,000
going to stop corruption in the program
because people are fornicating in it.

838
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:11,500
This is about Communism,
not immoral procreation.

839
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:14,500
- I agree with you, Hazel.
- I must get called for this committee.

840
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:17,500
Oh, you would be fantastic. 

841
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,200
- Mr. Crickshaw?
- Yes?

842
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,900
Is it time for our tutorial?

843
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,600
I can't come right now.
Uh... Tutorial was cancelled.

844
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:29,300
- Work together privately, and I will review.
- May we use the stage?

845
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:33,000
- Yes.
- Yea!

846
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:37,300
How long do you suppose
you can whore your talents... 

847
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,200
before you're used up and unwanted?

848
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,800
- Whore my talents, eh?
- I'm sorry. Who is the sponsor of The Shadow?

849
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,600
- I think of them as my patrons.
- His corporate Medicis.

850
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:47,000
They pay well, Marc, and with
that money I pay for the theater.

851
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:49,100
I buy props that the federal
government won't approve.

852
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,800
- Right.
- Costumes, makeup, set pieces, puppets.

853
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:55,800
- I feed my friends, get my actors drunk.
- You're such a god, Orson.

854
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,700
There's nothing wrong
with money, Marc.

855
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,200
Everybody digs that beat.
Everybody wants in. It's all the rage.

856
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,500
Even the boys in the Kremlin
are starting to roll around in it.

857
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:07,300
You think Mr. Stalin is eating
the same meal as a factory worker?

858
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:12,300
- No. We call it the Ritz and you call it the Comintern Club!
- I have no problem with money.

859
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,200
- I need it like everybody else does.
- Yeah, yeah.

860
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:16,600
The question is what will you do for
the money. Where do you draw the line?

861
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,600
Good question.

862
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:21,300
That's what my play is about.
Cradle Will Rock is about prostitution. 

863
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:25,900
Prostitution of education, of the press,
of the courts, and the most important...

864
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,400
- The Rothschild '29.
- Most important for you and me, Orson,

865
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,300
prostitution
of the artist.

866
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,000
Where do you draw the line?
Do you draw the line?

867
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:37,000
How long before you're
doing soap commercials?

868
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:39,600
- Well, this is going extremely well.
- jack.

869
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:43,600
I do hope you don't mind me interrupting,
but I was frightfully bored at my table.

870
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:47,600
- And I was thoroughly excluded.
- Not at all. Please, please, join us.

871
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,500
- Orson, darling.
- Ah.

872
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:53,900
We were just creating an insurmountable
tension for our working relationship.

873
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,900
Hey, birthday boy!

874
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,900
Come over here.
Hey! Hey!

875
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:06,600
- Hi. Oh.
- You're late for your own son's birthday.

876
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:08,600
I had to learn a song.
I have an audition tonight.

877
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:12,200
With Welles, huh?
How's Orson Welles doing, huh?

878
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,100
"The Shadow knows. "

879
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:16,400
Big shot, eh?
You thinka you a big shot?

880
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:20,700
Yes, Congressman Dies. "The Living
Newspaper" is the name of the project.

881
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,300
They write nothing else
but propaganda plays.

882
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,500
They write the plays produced
by the theater project?

883
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,500
- Yes, sir.
- And they produce them too?

884
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:31,300
- They write and produce them.
- They are on the federal payroll?

885
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,600
They are on the federal payroll,
each one. I don't know about this.

886
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:35,800
- You don't know about this? Me?
- You.

887
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:38,000
- I don't want to be rude, but this is distracting.
- Distracting?

888
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,000
- Can you stop him? Yes, you.
- Stop me? What gives?

889
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,200
Please, Mr. Crickshaw.

890
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:46,800
- No, Tommy.
- I would rather just do it with you.

891
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:50,400
Can we be alone?

892
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:54,600
- Oh! Me. just me.
- Yes. 

893
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,500
- Yes.
- Ah, yes. 

894
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:00,400
- I can do the congressman.
- Yes.

895
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,700
I beg your pardon, Miss Huffman.
Please continue.

896
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
It looks like summer weather

897
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:12,300
There's a fine warm sun

898
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,800
Truth is, I don't think of
anything when I'm singing.

899
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:19,600
I don't think about
how hungry I am, or how cold.

900
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:26,200
I can even be singing about sad things
and I feel all lifted up.

901
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,200
You love to sing.

902
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,400
Makes you warm,
makes you forget.

903
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:36,100
You have beautiful eyes.

904
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:38,400
Oh.

905
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:41,700
Why were you
crying before?

906
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:45,000
- When?
- When we danced. Was I that bad a dancer?

907
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:50,000
No.

908
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:52,000
No, it's nothing.

909
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:58,100
You're holding on
to secrets, Olive Stanton.

910
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:01,800
There's things that
have happened to you.

911
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:03,700
Bad things.

912
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:09,900
I guess I'm just not...
used to kindness recently.

913
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,100
You took me by surprise.

914
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,200
We've all been
hit by it, Olive.

915
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:19,900
We've all been hungry.

916
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:24,000
Nobody here
is gonna judge you.

917
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,600
This is your family now.

918
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:31,300
I make a little bed from wood

919
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:36,000
So, my son

920
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,500
Sleep good

921
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:44,100
So my

922
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,100
Son

923
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:51,500
Sleep good

924
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,800
- Really?
- My official position is that I love it.

925
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:57,700
Yes, that it's...
That I'm thrilled.

926
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,900
I think it's in my best interest to
be publicly excited about the piece.

927
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,800
But I must admit, I have great
trepidation about the mural.

928
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:06,600
First of all, I'm not sure
that it's great art.

929
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:08,600
It will be great.
It is not finished yet.

930
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,600
- It's not Picasso and it's not Matisse.
- They said no to you.

931
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:15,100
They did not want
to paint your lobby. Diego did.

932
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:19,000
You are not going to get anywhere
attacking the quality of the art.

933
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:21,600
First of all, you are wrong.
Second of all, you cannot win.

934
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:24,300
There will always be an art critic
somewhere to call you a boor,

935
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:29,100
an unsympathetic, unfeeling capitalist
blockhead incapable of appreciating true art.

936
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:32,500
- And I know... that is not you, Nelson.
- Of course that's not me.

937
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:36,600
There's not a greater appreciator of
modern art and freedom of expression than I.

938
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:38,900
- Yes, yes.
- Will you talk to him?

939
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:42,400
See if you can get him
to cheer it up just a little?

940
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,300
"Cheer it up"?

941
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,400
Margherita,

942
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,000
there are microscopic cells of
bubonic plague on the wall of my lobby.

943
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,400
Oh.

944
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,800
Orson, if you feel that way, 

945
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,700
why do you want to do
Cradle Will Rock?

946
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,700
Because it will piss off
all the right people.

947
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:01,600
And when you piss people off in the
theater, you're doing something right.

948
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:04,000
Because the theater should
provoke. It shouldn't pander.

949
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:08,600
People should leave the theater wanting
to fight, to argue, to jump, to fuck!

950
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:13,700
Goddamn it, if people leave
Cradle and head for a bistro... 

951
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:15,700
for a Spanish coffee
and a cigarette...

952
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:20,600
to discuss the intellectual underpinnings
of our story, then we're dead men!

953
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:25,900
- To Marion!
- I want angry, lust-filled theatergoers!

954
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,900
- I think they're...
- To the theater!

955
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:31,900
To the theater!

956
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,200
There was another play
called Processional. 

957
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:37,500
It dealt with a miner who had torn up
the American flag and was put into jail.

958
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,800
Later, he killed this soldier
who had seen him in a church or a,

959
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:46,000
a labor temple, having...
sexual intercourse, if you please,

960
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,800
- with his mother.
- Uh-oh.

961
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:52,300
That was the type of play
that was put on.

962
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:54,200
I'm so nervous.

963
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,300
You're doing great.
Did that really happen?

964
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,600
- What?
- In the play? He had intercourse with his mother?

965
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:02,900
Well, not on stage,
but they talked about it.

966
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,100
Oh. Oh.

967
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,100
Do you think I'll be called to testify?
I have so much to say.

968
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,600
If they don't call you,
they're crazy.

969
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,500
Okay, it's your turn.

970
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,600
"Now, thanks to Revolt of the Beavers, 

971
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:42,500
many children unschooled in
the technique of revolution... 

972
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,800
have an opportunity,
at government expense,

973
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,800
to improve their tender minds.

974
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,600
Mother Goose is no longer
a rhymed escapist.

975
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:54,800
She has been studying Marx. jack
and jill lead the class revolution. "

976
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,600
Saturday Evening Post. 

977
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:59,400
The gist is that Federal Theater
is teaching poor people to hate...

978
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,300
and possibly murder
rich children. 

979
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:04,400
- This is ridiculous.
- Well, I'm stunned. 

980
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:08,200
It's so absurd, it's funny. The Revolt
of the Beavers is a fairy tale. 

981
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,600
- What about the guns, Hallie?
- They don't shoot the big, fat beaver.

982
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:13,000
They just kick him out of Beaver Land.
So what does that say?

983
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,100
- Class war.
- It's a fairy tale!

984
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,500
Big Fat Beaver
is a big, fat capitalist.

985
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:20,500
The big, fat beaver
is a bad big, fat beaver. 

986
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:23,500
He is a greedy beaver.
He's a bad beaver.

987
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:49,800
Why are they singing this song?
Who taught him this song?

988
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:53,000
I don't know. 

989
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,400
- Who taught him this song?
- What song?

990
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,300
His cousins. What's the problem?

991
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:00,200
They're singing a blackshirt song...
in my house.

992
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:03,300
They're singing a song of Italy.
They're proud to be singing this song.

993
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:05,700
- Proud? It's a Fascist song.
- It's a beautiful song. 

994
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:08,400
- Did you teach him this song?
- What if I did?

995
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,300
Where do you live,
huh?

996
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,600
Where do I live?
What are you talking about?

997
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,900
This is America,
you dumb shit.

998
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
You wanna wave
your arms around, huh?

999
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,900
Go back to Italy,
all right?

1000
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:24,600
You insult Italy. You betray the land
that gave your mother life.

1001
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:27,600
You spit on Italy.
You slap your mother on the face.

1002
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:29,600
- You spit on your mother?
- That's enough.

1003
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:32,400
I'm 36 years old.
You can't smack me around anymore.

1004
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:35,000
Out. Get out. 

1005
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:40,900
- You respect your family.
- I respect my family. I just want him to leave. 

1006
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,800
He's your family!

1007
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,800
- Then you can go too.
- I can go too.

1008
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:47,100
- Yeah.
- Are you gonna kick me out, big boy?

1009
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:51,100
You can't afford to kick us out. Who
do you think pays for this apartment?

1010
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:53,700
- Then you want us to go?
Then we'll go, all right?

1011
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,300
It costs too much to hear
my son sing Fascist songs.

1012
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,400
Take the kids, we're going.
Let's go. We're going.

1013
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:01,200
- Let's go. We're gonna go. Joey, come on.
- Not the babies. 

1014
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:03,100
You call yourself an artist?

1015
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,800
The Italians were bringing art
and culture to this world...

1016
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:07,800
while your
Anglo-Saxon wife's relatives...

1017
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:10,700
were still picking the fleas
off each other, living in caves. 

1018
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:13,200
I'll get the kids.
Chance, joey, let's go.

1019
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,300
So a fella comes to work one day and there was a
girl there who'd been a chambermaid in his hotel,

1020
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,100
and had, uh, talked Communism
to him on many occasions.

1021
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:31,200
And he says, "What on Earth are you doing
here?" She says, "Oh, I'm an actress. "

1022
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:33,200
He says, "Go on.
You're not an actress.

1023
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:36,300
I know you. You were a chambermaid
in such-and-such hotel. "

1024
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:41,400
She tosses her head and said,
"Yes, but it was a theatrical hotel. "

1025
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:46,800
You're gonna say that
to the congressman?

1026
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:49,800
The point I'm making
is that she was a maid, 

1027
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:52,300
now she's an actress.

1028
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:56,900
Because of her connections
to the Communists in charge.

1029
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:01,500
Mr. Crickshaw, your, your lurid
stories about chambermaids...

1030
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,600
This is the U. S. Congress,

1031
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:06,500
not a, a beer hall.

1032
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,900
I am sorry, Hazel,
to disappoint you.

1033
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:13,300
I... I assure you it is the
furthest thing from my intentions.

1034
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:16,900
Mr. Crickshaw, there is an evil...
that must be rooted out.

1035
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,700
We must choose our words carefully,
or the press will mock our accusations.

1036
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:33,700
I'm attracted to you.

1037
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:36,200
Mr. Crickshaw, I...

1038
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:39,600
view our relationship in
purely professional terms.

1039
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:41,900
We are chums,
nothing more.

1040
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:04,100
Diego!

1041
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:07,000
- Diego!
- Who is it?

1042
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:09,900
- Margherita!
- Who?

1043
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,600
Margherita Sarfatti! How many
Margheritas do you know, Diego?

1044
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:17,100
Oh, I knew someone
by that name once.

1045
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:21,400
She was a jew, and then she
started going to bed with Fascists,

1046
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:24,400
so I assumed by now
she'd changed her name. 

1047
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:27,200
- Fascist. just one.
- What?

1048
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:30,900
I had one Fascist.
And Mussolini and I are over.

1049
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,100
- But you still work for him.
- Yes, and you... 

1050
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:38,000
- You are working for that cute little Rockefeller, huh?
- Touche. 

1051
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:42,700
Ah, times.
They change, huh?

1052
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:45,400
So many roads we travel.

1053
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:47,500
I was wondering
when you'd come.

1054
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,500
It is so big.

1055
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:54,400
- I hope you are getting paid
by the foot.

1056
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:58,000
- I wish.
- Oh, the cute little Rockefeller,

1057
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:03,700
he is hoping...
it could be more... cheerful.

1058
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:10,800
- He sent you here to tell me this?
- He's worried.

1059
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:16,500
Whose head has fallen?

1060
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:20,700
The head of Fascism.
Of Hitler. 

1061
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:24,400
And your friend,
the buffoon, Mussolini. 

1062
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:28,100
My friend, the buffoon, loves your art,
even though he hates your politics.

1063
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,700
- And you know what he said to me?
- No, what did he say?

1064
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:34,400
That if you are ever in trouble and
need help, Italy will be there for you.

1065
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,100
Oh, that's nice.
But I think...

1066
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:41,300
that the one that is going to need a place
to hide is gonna be Mussolini, not me.

1067
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:43,500
He and his pinche friend,
Hitler. 

1068
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:47,300
Hitler is not a friend of Mussolini.
Mussolini is a friend of manyjews.

1069
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,700
How beautiful.
Fascist love.

1070
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:52,000
And you, you're
not just in love.

1071
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:54,200
You're the publicity queen
for the new Roman Empire.

1072
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:58,500
Writing your articles for Hearst,
selling this murderer's philosophy,

1073
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:00,700
Trying to put a human face
on his Fascism.

1074
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:04,700
You're at the mercy
of a very powerful man.

1075
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:07,700
As are we all, Diego.

1076
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:11,700
As are we all.

1077
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:40,500
For God's sake, it's the only
thing that makes his singing bearable.

1078
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,900
Oh, have an open mind,
dear.

1079
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
What the hell is he
singing about, anyway?

1080
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:48,700
- I think it's something to do with the woes of a cobbler.
- Cobbler!

1081
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:50,800
- Shoemaker.
- This is ridiculous!

1082
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:55,200
I would appreciate it if you didn't cast your
aspersions so loudly in front of my protege.

1083
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:59,100
I didn't open my mouth at lunch today.
I don't interfere with your affairs.

1084
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:02,500
- You wouldn't understand them.
- I certainly would understand them.

1085
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:06,300
You're doing business with Benito Mussolini,
who's a very dangerous man, in my estimation.

1086
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:10,700
- In your estimation.
- I'm looking beyond your profit margin to a moral place, dear.

1087
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:15,200
A terribly complex place we'll all have
to deal with in the next few years.

1088
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:18,000
We havejewish friends,
you know.

1089
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:40,000
Remember Troy Remember Lafayette

1090
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:43,600
Remember the Alamo
Remember our womanhood

1091
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:47,000
Remember those
innocent unborn babies

1092
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,600
Don't let George do it You do it

1093
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,800
Make the world safe for democracy,
make the world safe for liberty

1094
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:55,000
I never could understand
the reality of people...

1095
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:58,300
breaking into song
in the middle of a play, could you?

1096
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:01,000
Are you sure you want this
man to direct your play, Marc?

1097
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,900
Not really, no.

1098
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,100
To end all war

1099
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:08,200
That was very nice.
Who's next?

1100
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:10,900
- john Adair. john Adair.
- I haven't gotten permission...

1101
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,100
Just go out there. Don't say anything,
don't apologize.

1102
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,200
Just sing from your heart.
Go on.

1103
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,900
Uh, Moll's song.

1104
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:23,400
- That's notjohn Adair, is it?
- She's one of mine.

1105
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:26,300
- One of mine.
- Augusta, no stagehands...

1106
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:28,400
No, wait. I like her.
Let her sing.

1107
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,000
I'm checkin' home now

1108
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:40,100
Call it a night
Going up to...

1109
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,200
This is the look of a prostitute. 

1110
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:45,100
Fresh, innocent, vulnerable.

1111
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:47,700
I don't want some brassy,
pulchritudinous whore, jack.

1112
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:50,900
I want some gal who's driven to
sell her body because she's hungry.

1113
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:56,300
The market crash of 1929 made reluctant
whores out of many young gals.

1114
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,700
You'd find that out
if you were a heterosexual, jack.

1115
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:08,000
The other five my efforts
ain't required

1116
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:11,900
For two days out of seven

1117
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:16,300
Two dollar bills
I'm given

1118
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:20,400
So I'm just searching

1119
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,300
Along the street

1120
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:27,400
- Why did we cast her? She's terrible.
- Your glass sets are terrible.

1121
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:30,400
No one knows where they are.
Actors enter in fear of their lives.

1122
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:32,300
Say another word, jack,
I'm gonna murder you.

1123
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
- What the hell is going on?
- Hello, baby.

1124
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:46,200
Someone explain to me how it's
possible that the night court cue...

1125
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:48,800
- is playing in the first scene.
- Hello, big boy. 

1126
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:51,600
- Abe, where the hell are you?
- Busy, baby?

1127
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:54,900
- No problem, Orson, no problem!
- Not so very.

1128
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:58,600
I'd like to give you a hundred bucks

1129
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:01,300
But I've only got
30 cents

1130
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:05,000
- So would you wait
till I catch my breath

1131
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:07,700
On account of it's so immense

1132
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,700
- Cuts in personnel?
- Well, 20%. 

1133
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:13,900
- That's 3,000 people out of work.
- Effective immediately.

1134
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:16,200
Because of the cuts
and reorganization, any new play,

1135
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:19,800
musical performance or art gallery is
prohibited from opening beforejuly 1.

1136
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:22,700
- This is an outrage.
- Our train leaves in 20 minutes.

1137
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:26,000
Paul, we'll be down in Washington for
two days. Can't this wait till I return?

1138
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:29,300
This has gone out to all projects
already. I play by the book.

1139
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:33,000
Of course you do, but you could at least
give me the chance to deal with the directors.

1140
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:35,400
Good Lord, Cradle Will Rock
opens tomorrow. 

1141
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:38,100
- Cradle opens tomorrow?
- Does that mean the opening is cancelled?

1142
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:41,600
- I'm afraid it does.
- That is just downright disgraceful behavior.

1143
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:44,600
Rose, get mejack Houseman on
the phone. I have to talk tojack.

1144
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:47,400
- There isn't time.
- I'll call Mr. Houseman and explain everything.

1145
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,600
- Let's go.
- You better get going. Don't be late. 

1146
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:54,100
Hallie, I'm sorry.

1147
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:56,700
I can conclude by saying... 

1148
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:59,900
I thank you for your patience
and your kindness to me. 

1149
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,500
We certainly hope that
the results of this committee...

1150
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:05,900
will be to clear out
the Communism...

1151
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:08,700
on the Federal Project
and the pro-Communism,

1152
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:11,100
and place the project
in the hands... 

1153
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:14,400
of efficient,
professional people.

1154
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,200
Place it in the hands
of those who are in sympathy... 

1155
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:19,500
with the American home
and government.

1156
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:21,700
Is that what you mean?

1157
01:06:21,800 --> 01:06:26,400
- She loves you.
- I'm afraid I did not understand the question, Mr. Chairman.

1158
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,300
She loves you not.

1159
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:32,300
She...
She loves you not.

1160
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,400
She loves you not.

1161
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:37,900
Mr. Crickshaw, you're on. 

1162
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,600
She loves you... not.

1163
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:43,200
... exactly what I mean,
Mr. Chairman.

1164
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:46,600
Well, uh, thank you
for coming before this committee...

1165
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:49,300
and giving us the facts
that you have.

1166
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:51,600
Well, thank you for having
this committee...

1167
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:55,000
and receiving
the facts that I have.

1168
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Open shop is when a worker
can be kicked around, demoted fired. 

1169
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:05,400
Just like that, he's all alone.
He's free.

1170
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:09,700
Free to be wiped out. Closed shop,
he's got 50,000 other workers with him,

1171
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:13,100
ready to back him up, every one
of them, to the last lunch pail.

1172
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,900
The difference?
This is an open shop.

1173
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:20,400
This is a closed shop.
This... is a union!

1174
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,000
Order in the courtroom,
order in the courtroom. 

1175
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:25,100
Next case.
Reverend Salvation.

1176
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,800
- Where are they?
- The Liberty Committee, the Liberty Committee!

1177
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:29,800
- Wrong cue, Augusta!
- Stand by. 

1178
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,900
Abe, what is the cue number?

1179
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,900
- Abe!
- What?

1180
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:36,300
- Where do we go from...
- Fifty-three!

1181
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:38,400
Cue 53. Moll's line:
"Reverend Salvation.

1182
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:41,100
- Habitual prostitute since 1915. "
- Reverend Salvation...

1183
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:44,600
- Wait! - Wait! -
When they say go, dear.

1184
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:47,000
- I've never done this before.
- I'm astonished!

1185
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:48,300
- Ready, Abe?
- Ready!

1186
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:51,500
- Go! Cue! -
That's you. - Me?

1187
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,800
- Yes, you!
- Well, what do I do?

1188
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:56,300
Will you say
the fucking line?

1189
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:01,400
Reverend Salvation.
Habitual prostitute since 1915.

1190
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:04,700
- Don't start crying!
- You're Larry Foreman.

1191
01:08:04,700 --> 01:08:06,700
- I've been looking all over town for you.
- Wrong scene, Frank.

1192
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:09,500
Wrong scene. 

1193
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:14,600
You haven't
gotten a single scene right yet!

1194
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:18,500
- Not one time!
- Call it a night, everybody!

1195
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:21,200
Call it a night!
That's it! Get outta here!

1196
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,800
- Charles Darwin.
- Charles Darwin?

1197
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:27,500
- What's going on?
- There you are, Mr. Crickshaw.

1198
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:29,600
I pounded on your door.
I didn't hear an answer.

1199
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:33,200
- Am I going on next?
- No, sir, this is your slot.

1200
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,900
I sent Sid and Larry on
to cover for you.

1201
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:38,700
That's nothing. A woman can
make a monkey out of a man in an hour.

1202
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:40,700
That's my act. 

1203
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:43,500
I'm sorry, sir.
We had to do something.

1204
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,000
- Was it the lumberjack? Your brother?
- You're giving me a headache. 

1205
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:49,600
A headache? Only people with brains
have headaches.

1206
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:55,400
Why can't you paint
another face over it?

1207
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,300
Would you prefer Stalin?
I don't.

1208
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,700
I was kicked out of the Communist
Party for disagreeing with him,

1209
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:01,600
but if you want,
I'll paint Stalin.

1210
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:04,000
- You're not being very cooperative.
- I am too!

1211
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,900
I told you that I would paint Abraham
Lincoln surrounded by freed slaves...

1212
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,500
to counterbalance Lenin,
and you rejected the idea.

1213
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:14,500
- Why Lenin?
- He's a revolutionary leader,

1214
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:16,700
like your Washington
and, uh, jefferson.

1215
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:19,900
Hey, there's an idea.
Paintjefferson.

1216
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,200
- That's not a bad idea. What do you say?
- That's not a bad idea at all.

1217
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:24,200
- What do you say?
- That's ridiculous!

1218
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:28,000
I said Abraham Lincoln
to balance Lenin, but Lenin stays.

1219
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:31,700
This is not our revolution, Diego. This
is the United States. It's not Russia.

1220
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:35,700
Um-hmm, and I am Diego Rivera,
not Frederick Remington.

1221
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:38,200
You understand that it is
entirely inappropriate... 

1222
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:41,400
to feature a Communist leader
in the lobby of a Rockefeller building?

1223
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:46,400
No. I believe nothing in art is
inappropriate. I paint what I see.

1224
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:48,600
We're going to have to insist
that the face be removed.

1225
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:50,400
Absolutely not!

1226
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:54,000
Look, you son of a bitch, we're trying
to be nice! This is betrayal!

1227
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:56,900
- Betrayal?
- Yes! There was no indication in your sketches... 

1228
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:59,200
you would be featuring
Communist leaders in the mural!

1229
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:02,100
You were hired on the basis
of said sketches!

1230
01:10:02,100 --> 01:10:04,900
And you've changed them.
It's not fair!

1231
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:09,100
Lenin stays!

1232
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:15,500
How the hell do we open
without a cue-to-cue?

1233
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:18,400
Actors are called early.
We'll cue-to-cue in the morning.

1234
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:21,100
There's 175 cues to go!

1235
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:25,100
- Perhaps if you cut some cues...
- jack, there's a call from Hallie Flanagan's office!

1236
01:10:25,200 --> 01:10:27,600
Not now, Augusta, I'm in
the middle of an argument.

1237
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:29,900
You were singing flat.
Why can't you admit it?

1238
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,200
- Stop yelling!
- You were a quarter tone flat the entire last strain!

1239
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,800
All you had to do
was listen to the trumpet!

1240
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:38,400
He didn't mean it.
He's very tense.

1241
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,500
It's always this way
during cue-to-cues.

1242
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:43,000
Union rules say we get a 12-hour break.
I'll see you at noon.

1243
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:45,300
- Come on, Olive.
- Augusta!

1244
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:47,200
You oughta be dressed by now.

1245
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:52,800
He's yelling at us.
We can't see what we're doing.

1246
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:56,100
- The actors need flashlights.
- Tell them to light a match!

1247
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:00,100
My God! Stop!

1248
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:04,100
Really fucking necessary to have eight
fucking lighting cues for a single entrance?

1249
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:07,400
It's an important entrance,
and I'm the fucking director!

1250
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,300
- Yes, of a fucking disaster!
- Augusta!

1251
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:13,200
I have to take my kids to a free clinic in the
morning. Tell Mr. Welles I'll be in at 11:30.

1252
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:15,400
I'm staying here tonight.
Do you hear me?

1253
01:11:15,500 --> 01:11:18,400
I hate you!
And you can sleep alone tonight!

1254
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:22,200
I'll finally get some rest
instead of listening to you complain!

1255
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:24,900
- I'm leaving. I'm leaving.
- You can't leave.

1256
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:26,800
- You're the producer.
- That's right.

1257
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:31,100
And as the producer, I can fire whomever
I please, and I am fucking fired.

1258
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:35,200
You'll come crawling back
like a bitch on heat to his master!

1259
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:37,600
I'm glad he didn't get to me.
I can't remember my lines.

1260
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:40,300
I'm stricken
with a cerebral malaise.

1261
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,600
No. God, cut it.
God! just forget it! Go home!

1262
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:45,600
Forget it!
God!

1263
01:11:45,700 --> 01:11:48,600
First he kills all my deals with Italy.

1264
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:52,500
Now he's telling me how to run
my business! I will not budge!

1265
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:56,800
Well, let him call, the crippled
son of a bitch. Let him call!

1266
01:11:56,900 --> 01:11:59,000
Jiminyjesus!
The bastards!

1267
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:01,900
Get this damn thing off of me.
Roosevelt's gonna call.

1268
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:04,900
- Oh, it's good. You look adorable.
- I don't want to look adorable. 

1269
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,700
- I want to look angry.
- We'll make a stunning pair.

1270
01:12:07,700 --> 01:12:10,500
- I need to let it out.
- Can you get it ready by tomorrow?

1271
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:13,600
- Oui, madame.
- The bastard wants me to join with the rest of Little Steel... 

1272
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:15,600
- in acknowledging the union.
- How terrible.

1273
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,600
- Yes, it is terrible.
- It's worse than a strike.

1274
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:20,200
- No, it's not worse than a strike.
- I know so little.

1275
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:23,000
Gray, dear, that awful woman
came by and left two packages.

1276
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,800
Woman? Packages?

1277
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:27,900
- Oh, Carlo, can you grab the packages?
- Nyet. Merci. 

1278
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,300
Mr. Mathers, sir, two parcels were left
for you from one Margherita Sarfatti.

1279
01:12:32,300 --> 01:12:34,000
Thank you, Paul.
Out!

1280
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:37,300
- What is in them?
- Oh-ho, so nosy.

1281
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:42,100
- Oh, pray tell.
- Mmm, perhaps... it's a surprise.

1282
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:44,000
Suppose it were a gift.

1283
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:47,100
- What? From Sarfatti?
- Purchased through her.

1284
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:49,400
- For you.
- Oh, how interesting.

1285
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:53,200
Yes. So...

1286
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:55,500
mind your business.

1287
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:59,300
- Did you see the papers today?
- No. 

1288
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:02,400
It was like Cradle Will Rock
was on the front page. 

1289
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:05,300
- They're having a strike.
- Who?

1290
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:08,400
- A steel strike. Mathers Steel.
- Really?

1291
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:12,700
I'm telling you, the same themes,
the same words almost.

1292
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:19,000
- It's a dangerous play you're in.
- It's a great role.

1293
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:22,100
- I'm lucky, huh?
- Hmm.

1294
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:24,800
Just don't want
to blow it.

1295
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:27,100
It's too important.

1296
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:31,500
Daddy, are we going
to lose our room?

1297
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,400
No, Chance.
Why do you say that?

1298
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,500
Joey told me.

1299
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:39,600
Michael O'Brien's family
lost their apartment.

1300
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:42,200
He doesn't go to school
anymore. 

1301
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:44,700
Daddy's got a job,
so, uh, we're gonna be fine. 

1302
01:13:44,700 --> 01:13:48,500
Michael O'Brien's father had a job,
and then he lost it and they were poor.

1303
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:53,400
Well, we're poor,
but we're gonna be fine.

1304
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:57,700
We should say some prayers
just to be safe, though. All right?

1305
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:03,200
- john?
- Yeah. 

1306
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:05,600
- Am I horrible?
- Huh?

1307
01:14:05,700 --> 01:14:08,100
In the play.
Am I horrible?

1308
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:10,000
No, you're not horrible.

1309
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:13,600
- Am I not good?
- No, you're good.

1310
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:16,300
But I'm not great.

1311
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:19,200
No, you're great.

1312
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:21,900
At times. 

1313
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,400
It's hard to be great.
Some actors can be great all the time. 

1314
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:27,700
It's your first role.
You try hard.

1315
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:31,300
Listen.

1316
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:34,200
You're better off
than you were.

1317
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:42,600
Your play is horrible, indulgent,
masturbatory nonsense.

1318
01:14:42,700 --> 01:14:44,800
You don't really
believe that, do you?

1319
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,700
You hear what you
want to hear.

1320
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,900
If you'd slept a little more,
you might have had a shot.

1321
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:52,100
- Garbage.
- It's not the end of the world.

1322
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:58,500
- I saw a rat today.
- Where?

1323
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:00,400
In here.

1324
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:07,200
- You know who stopped by?
- No.

1325
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:10,200
Your mama.

1326
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:15,200
- She was pretty shocked about how we were living.
- She would be.

1327
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:18,400
- I think she wants to help.
- No.

1328
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:22,700
Aldo, we could really use the money.

1329
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:25,800
I don't want
my family's money.

1330
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:30,300
So the kids can go hungry just because
of your pride, your politics.

1331
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:34,100
- You want chubby little Fascists?
- No! How can you say that?

1332
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:37,000
But I don't want to wait in soup lines
with them. I don't want...

1333
01:15:37,100 --> 01:15:39,800
What would that teach them
if we take my parents' money?

1334
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:42,200
That it's all right to believe
in something or have pride,

1335
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:44,900
but if you're just a little bit
uncomfortable or hungry, sell it.

1336
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,300
Aldo, there are
rats in here.

1337
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,700
Paul Edwards couldn't reach
Jack Houseman last night. 

1338
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:56,600
- He's trying today.
- Keep on top of that.

1339
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:58,800
We have to reassurejack that we
will find a way to do his show.

1340
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:01,200
- They're chomping at the bit for you.
- Twenty percent cuts, Harry.

1341
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:03,600
- I had no warning.
- It's temporary, a stopgap.

1342
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:06,000
A cash-flow problem.
We'll get the 20% back, Hallie.

1343
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:07,900
- Can I hold you to that?
- Yes.

1344
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,200
- Who testified last night?
- Hazel Huffman. A real nutcase.

1345
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:12,600
She got good headlines, though most of
the press is so bored of this committee...

1346
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:14,500
they just bite the bait
and print the highlights.

1347
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,400
- They'll all be coming back for you, thought, Hallie.
- I'm honored.

1348
01:16:16,500 --> 01:16:18,400
Not to put any pressure on you,
but a good showing today would help.

1349
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:21,400
By order of the federal government,
no one is allowed in the theater. 

1350
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:23,900
No props, costumes,
set pieces can be removed. 

1351
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:25,900
- Why?
- I don't know, sir.

1352
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:28,100
- For how long?
- I don't know, sir.

1353
01:16:28,100 --> 01:16:30,700
We have an office in the back.
I assume we can use that.

1354
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,600
I'll have to check
with my commander.

1355
01:16:32,700 --> 01:16:35,100
Go and check with Stalin,
you cossack stooge.

1356
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:37,200
- jack! jack!
- I need to use the telephone.

1357
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:40,500
- What's happening?
- We've been shut out. The feds have closed us down.

1358
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:43,300
- How exciting.
- Darling, I need your help. What are you doing right now?

1359
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:46,600
I've an opening at the Metropolitan,
and Mr. Mathers has labor troubles.

1360
01:16:46,700 --> 01:16:48,500
Tonight there's a masquerade
ball at the Vanderhuesens.

1361
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:50,400
I'm a very busy bunny.
What do you need?

1362
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:52,600
I need you to join us in a
clandestine operation. Are you game?

1363
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:55,600
Clandestin!
How is it done? Go, james. 

1364
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:57,900
- Que pasa?
- Esta la guerra. 

1365
01:16:57,900 --> 01:16:59,700
Si. Adios. 

1366
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,900
Mrs. Flanagan, you are
the first woman in America...

1367
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:05,600
to receive the Guggenheim Foundation
scholarship.

1368
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:07,700
- Is that correct?
- Yes, that is correct.

1369
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:12,500
And you went to study abroad for what,
12, 14 months to study the theater?

1370
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,700
- I did.
- What date was that?

1371
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:17,400
That was in 1926 and 1927.

1372
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:19,800
You spent most of your time
in what country?

1373
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:22,600
In Russia.

1374
01:17:22,700 --> 01:17:25,600
How much time did you spend
in Russia, Mrs. Flanagan?

1375
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:28,500
I spent two months and a half
in Russia out of fourteen months.

1376
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:31,500
- But let me say, gentlemen...
- Did you spend more time there... 

1377
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:34,200
studying the theater than
you did in any other country?

1378
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:37,700
I did, because there are many more theaters
in Russia than there are in any other country.

1379
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:39,700
Did you or did you not
make the statement... 

1380
01:17:39,700 --> 01:17:42,700
that the theater in Russia
is more vital and important?

1381
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:45,200
- Yes, I did find that.
- What is it about the Russian theater... 

1382
01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:47,600
that makes it more vital and important
than the theaters of the Continent...

1383
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:49,500
and the theaters
of the United States?

1384
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:52,500
I would be glad to answer that,
but before I do,

1385
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:55,000
I would like to say that I have
maintained consistently...

1386
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,400
that Federal Theater
is American theater.

1387
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:59,900
American theater
founded on American principles,

1388
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,900
which has nothing to do
with the Russian theater.

1389
01:18:01,900 --> 01:18:04,300
I know, but you're not
answering the question, Mrs. Flanagan.

1390
01:18:04,400 --> 01:18:06,800
Did you make later trips
to Russia to study the theater?

1391
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,500
I went to Russia in 1931.

1392
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:12,000
- Did you attend the Olympiad there?
- I did.

1393
01:18:12,100 --> 01:18:14,800
Was this at the time of
the Fifth Red International...

1394
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:18,000
of Labor Unions
that you attended?

1395
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:22,000
I wouldn't know about that. I was going
to see theater. That was my one concern. 

1396
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,600
Are you a member of any Russian
organization at the present time?

1397
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:28,300
- I am not.
- Have you been a member of any Russian organization?

1398
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:30,000
I have not.

1399
01:18:30,100 --> 01:18:31,900
- Open up!
- Go away!

1400
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,200
I'm never speaking
to you again!

1401
01:18:35,300 --> 01:18:38,400
- You leave me alone!
- Open the window!

1402
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:41,700
- Open it, open it!
- I'm sorry, Mr. Houseman.

1403
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,600
Um... Oh.

1404
01:18:43,700 --> 01:18:47,300
For God's sake, put some clothes on,
woman! Don't you realize we're under siege?

1405
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:49,300
- Under siege?
- What are you doing here, anyway?

1406
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:51,600
- We had a fight. I stayed the night.
- Halt! Who goes there?

1407
01:18:51,700 --> 01:18:53,500
I have Hallie's office
on the line. 

1408
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:57,000
Hallie Flanagan, please.
Where in Washington?

1409
01:18:57,100 --> 01:19:00,000
This is jack Houseman.
My theater's been seized by cossacks.

1410
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:03,100
I need to speak with her immediately.
This is an emergency!

1411
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:06,000
- Oh, she's in Washington testifying.
- We're radicals, jack.

1412
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,400
Locked out for content.
All very exciting.

1413
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:10,700
We need a plan, we need a plan.
Gotta think, gotta think.

1414
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:13,700
- We need the plan, plan, plan.
- We'll find a different theater.

1415
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:16,700
Can't find a different...
Find a different theater!

1416
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:22,600
Augusta, find me George Zorn. He's a
booker. He'll know all the dark theaters.

1417
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:25,000
- We'll smuggle the costumes out.
- Yes, and the set.

1418
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:28,000
I hate the set! It's a nightmare!
A brilliant idea poorly executed.

1419
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,300
I've always said the play would
work better on a bare stage.

1420
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,200
- Hallie said that.
- No, I said it first.

1421
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:34,200
- No, you didn't. No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did. Yes, I did.

1422
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:37,200
- Yes, I bloody well did!
- Fine, jack, you win. You've got the biggest creative dick.

1423
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:39,100
- Thank you.
- I have George Zorn on the line.

1424
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:42,300
George! Yes, we have
a theatrical emergency here.

1425
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,900
Can you come over to
Maxine Elliot's theater? Now?

1426
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
They criticized
The Revolt of the Beavers... 

1427
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:49,400
because they thought that it was
poisoning the minds of youth.

1428
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:51,800
- For that reason, I would like to read into the record...
- She's here. 

1429
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:54,500
some of the reactions of children
who have seen this play. 

1430
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:57,200
- Hello.
- "The play teaches us never to be selfish. 

1431
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:59,900
That it is better
to be good than bad. 

1432
01:19:59,900 --> 01:20:04,300
That if you are unkind any time in
your life, you will always regret it. "

1433
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:09,000
- I could read all of this...
- Thank you. 

1434
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:11,000
Cuts.
Twenty percent.

1435
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:13,000
3,000 people
out of work.

1436
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,700
I sure hope they're all Reds
that lose their jobs.

1437
01:20:19,700 --> 01:20:21,600
Next.

1438
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:28,000
Don't look at me.

1439
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,900
- What?
- Don't look. Please.

1440
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,800
- Are you an actor?
- Yes.

1441
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:33,700
- Cradle Will Rock?
- Yes. 

1442
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:37,800
Now listen carefully. Use the back entrance
through the window of the women's dressing room.

1443
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:39,800
Good luck.
Godspeed.

1444
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:49,500
Roosevelt wants me to give in.
Follow the rest of Little Steel.

1445
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,400
- He has no spine.
- He says if we don't capitulate, 

1446
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:54,500
- we'll have a revolution on our hands.
- Revolution. 

1447
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:58,100
So what do you think, W. H? You think
Lewis has that kind of power?

1448
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:02,500
I think people are poor and angry and will
follow anybody that promises them gold.

1449
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:06,000
They've got you cornered, Gray.
If you give in, you'll lose money...

1450
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:09,100
and you open the floodgates
to socialists and radicals.

1451
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:11,900
If you resist, you'll wind up
resisting with guns.

1452
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:14,200
And that won't look good.

1453
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:17,500
Killing strikers doesn't play
to the public.

1454
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:20,300
You've got to find a way... 

1455
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:24,100
to give them a dollar
and take two, huh?

1456
01:21:24,100 --> 01:21:26,700
Not an easy task.

1457
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:30,100
Magnificent.

1458
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:36,200
Now listen. I'm buying art.
That's all.

1459
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:38,200
If anything comes back
to me,

1460
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:41,200
- I'll bury you and your company.
- Not to worry.

1461
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:46,000
- Diego Rivera?
- Yes.

1462
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:48,600
You must vacate the premises.
Your work is now completed.

1463
01:21:48,700 --> 01:21:51,200
Rockefeller Center no longer
requires your services.

1464
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:57,800
Fuck off!
Chacho! Chacho!

1465
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:06,000
Get me the Tribune.
What's the critic's name there?

1466
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:08,800
Oh, never mind!
Just get me the national desk.

1467
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:11,800
No can do on thejolson Theater. The
owner's in the Berkshires. Unreachable.

1468
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:14,500
- What about the Gossamer Arts?
- Closed by the Health Department.

1469
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:17,400
- The Rialto?
- Huh! The owner's a Liberty Leaguer, very conservative.

1470
01:22:17,500 --> 01:22:20,600
- I can try.
- Do try, George. I love irony.

1471
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:22,700
This is Orson Welles, and I believe
you may be interested to know...

1472
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,900
that for the first time
in American history,

1473
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:28,700
the government has sent armed guards
to prevent the performance of a play!

1474
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:33,200
Frida!

1475
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:35,600
Movilizar
the Art Student's League!

1476
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:47,400
News flash, news flash!
Twenty percent cuts in personnel!

1477
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:51,000
It's curtains for all of us. I hear a rumor
they're gonna shut this whole project down.

1478
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,000
- What do you think, Mr. Turncoat?
- We worked up a little routine.

1479
01:22:54,100 --> 01:22:56,000
Can you look at it,
give us your advice?

1480
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:59,200
You're Reds.
I don't talk to Reds.

1481
01:22:59,300 --> 01:23:02,400
We're not red, darling.
Pink. Like a flower.

1482
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:06,700
We're homosexuals, not Communists.

1483
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:09,600
- You thought we were Communists?
- Oh, that's rich.

1484
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:11,800
- Come on. Watch our act.
- Leave me alone.

1485
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:20,600
Mr. Rockefeller wanted to convey his
feelings of appreciation for your work...

1486
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:23,100
and instructed me to give you
this check as payment in full.

1487
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:25,500
This is it? Now what?
You paint over Lenin's face?

1488
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:29,800
You gonna put Hearst's face on it? Or
Hitler? Paint over the war, the soldiers?

1489
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:32,600
Turn them into jolly, drunken
English fox hunters?

1490
01:23:32,700 --> 01:23:35,100
A little bucolic
pastoral scene...

1491
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:38,200
of men on horses
chasing after a little fox?

1492
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:41,500
Listen, folks, can I have
your attention, please?

1493
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,700
Folks!

1494
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:47,300
Due to cutbacks, we will not
be hiring at the present time.

1495
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:52,400
To save you time and aggravation,

1496
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:56,300
we suggest you drop off
your applications and go home...

1497
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:58,400
or to the park.

1498
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:00,300
We're very sorry.

1499
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:12,300
Mrs. Flanagan,
how many people do you figure... 

1500
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:15,700
you had as audience
in the United States for these plays?

1501
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:18,000
The recorded figure,
Congressman Dies, was something like... 

1502
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:20,500
- 25 million people.
- In other words, you have reached... 

1503
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:24,100
approximately 25% of our population
with your plays.

1504
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:26,100
Something like that.
Yes.

1505
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:28,300
Now... you wrote for
Theater Arts Monthly, 

1506
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:30,300
November 1931,
did you not?

1507
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:34,200
- Yes, I did.
- I quote this from that same article. 

1508
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:37,300
"Start dramatic groups in unions,
in fraternal organizations, 

1509
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:40,800
in social clubs, in company unions,
in Y. M. C. A. 's. 

1510
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:44,100
Dot the land from coast to coast.
Don't expect profit in money.

1511
01:24:44,200 --> 01:24:47,500
These theaters exist
to awaken the workers. "

1512
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,400
May I interrupt?
Please notice that that is a quotation.

1513
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:54,600
A quotation, yes.
But these are your words I'm quoting.

1514
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:59,500
"The workers'theaters intend to remake a
social structure without the help of money. 

1515
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:02,300
And this ambition alone
invests their undertaking...

1516
01:25:02,300 --> 01:25:05,000
with a certain
Marlowesque madness. "

1517
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:07,400
You are quoting from this Marlowe.
Is he a Communist?

1518
01:25:07,500 --> 01:25:10,700
- I'm very sorry. I was quoting
from Christopher Marlowe.

1519
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:13,400
Tell us who this Marlowe is so we can
get the proper reference, 

1520
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:15,300
because that is all
we want to do.

1521
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:19,000
Put in the record that he was the greatest
dramatist in the period of Shakespeare,

1522
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:22,300
immediately preceding
Shakespeare.

1523
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:26,700
Of course, we had what some people call
Communists back in the days of Greek theater.

1524
01:25:26,700 --> 01:25:29,300
- If you say so.
- And I believe Mr. Euripides...

1525
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:31,600
was guilty of teaching
class-consciousness also, wasn't he?

1526
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:34,400
I believe it was alleged against
all the Greek dramatists.

1527
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:36,800
So we cannot say
when it began.

1528
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:40,800
Wasn't it alleged also of Ibsen and
against practically every great playwright?

1529
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:43,500
I think so.

1530
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:46,400
- Countess, we need a piano.
- Piano?

1531
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:48,300
- In case the theater we find doesn't have one.
- Good thinking.

1532
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:50,200
Here's ten dollars.
That should cover the rental.

1533
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:52,200
Marc, tell the countess
where she might find a piano.

1534
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:54,200
- Um...
- Mr. Welles, will you... 

1535
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:57,300
We most assuredly will be performing
The Cradle Will Rock tonight!

1536
01:25:57,400 --> 01:26:00,300
- What theater?
- We are currently negotiating with three theaters.

1537
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,200
We'll let you know
within the hour. 

1538
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:08,300
Why can't we go in?

1539
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:11,200
This is private property!
It's not open to the public!

1540
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:13,400
- We want to see the painting.
- The lobby is closed.

1541
01:26:13,400 --> 01:26:16,200
- Let us in!
- Down with Rockefeller!

1542
01:26:18,300 --> 01:26:20,100
The paint'll come through.

1543
01:26:20,200 --> 01:26:22,100
- Must hit.
- Chip.

1544
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:25,300
- Chip?
- Nelson?

1545
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:27,300
Nelson?

1546
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:30,200
Hi. Your masquerade party
starts in an hour.

1547
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:32,500
- You wanted me to remind you.
- Claire! Not now. 

1548
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:35,600
Thank you.

1549
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:38,000
Chip?

1550
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,300
Sol, do we have
a pneumatic drill?

1551
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:43,200
- You're Larry Foreman.
- Ex-foreman.

1552
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:45,100
I've been looking
all over town for you.

1553
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,300
How's the union returns,
Mr. Mister.

1554
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:49,200
Oh, damn.
What is it?

1555
01:26:49,300 --> 01:26:51,300
- "They haven't come to a decision yet. "
- We can do this!

1556
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:53,500
Has anyone asked the W. P. A.
if this is okay?

1557
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:56,900
Hallie is in Washington testifying.
Will, bring the guitar out front.

1558
01:26:57,000 --> 01:26:59,000
- I'm not gonna do it.
- jack,

1559
01:26:59,100 --> 01:27:01,100
we've got trouble with the musicians
and the actors unions.

1560
01:27:01,200 --> 01:27:03,600
- They won't sanction a performance elsewhere.
- What?

1561
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:07,500
The actors union and the musicians union
are forbidding their members to perform.

1562
01:27:08,700 --> 01:27:11,900
Mathers Steel
will not be intimidated. james!

1563
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,700
Just a second.
Where the hell is my wife?

1564
01:27:14,700 --> 01:27:17,700
I last seen her at Maxine Elliot's
theater downtown, sir.

1565
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:19,600
- You left her there?
- She dismissed me, sir.

1566
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:21,500
- Bring the car around.
- Yes, sir.

1567
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:24,100
Are we clear? That's right.
Whatever it takes.

1568
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:28,200
- Madame Sarfatti to see you, sir.
- Show her in.

1569
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:30,400
- Carlo, a little privacy, please.
- Hmm?

1570
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:33,700
- Why don't you go clean the toilets or something?
- I clean nothing.

1571
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:36,500
- Gray, such a pleasure to see you.
- Buona sera. 

1572
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:39,500
- I mean, it is a great pleasure to...
- We have met before.

1573
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:41,400
- I don't think so.
- Carlo, out!

1574
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:44,800
- Your wig, sir.
- Out! Everybody, out! Out!

1575
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:51,200
Oh, Gray, Gray.
Did you receive the package?

1576
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:53,400
Yes, I did.

1577
01:27:53,500 --> 01:27:56,300
- You did not open it?
- Uh, no, I haven't.

1578
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:58,200
Well...

1579
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:02,200
And Mr. Hearst,
did he receive his package?

1580
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:04,600
- Yes, yes, he did.
- Did it please him?

1581
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:08,000
Oh, yes, very much.
So when do you sail?

1582
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:09,900
Tonight.

1583
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:12,600
Your payment, madam.

1584
01:28:12,700 --> 01:28:16,500
Thank you, thank you.
And Mussolini thanks you.

1585
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:18,900
We... I... We are
going to miss you.

1586
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:22,500
You did not tell me
what you feel.

1587
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:25,900
- About you?
- About the painting. You open it,

1588
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
but you say nothing.

1589
01:28:28,100 --> 01:28:31,000
Oh, uh... I...
I love it.

1590
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,200
It's, uh...
It's a masterpiece.

1591
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:35,300
- Yes. Yes.
- Is it da Vinci?

1592
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:38,100
And where will you
hang her?

1593
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:42,100
Uh, here in the study.
Uh, over the fireplace.

1594
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:45,700
- Ah.
- Hmm?

1595
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:49,700
Oh, what a shame
to let the classics slip away.

1596
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:53,800
He won't even
reconsider, right?

1597
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:56,700
- What's going on?
- Actor's Equity says no.

1598
01:28:56,700 --> 01:28:59,500
- We can't do the show.
- We can't do the show. 

1599
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:02,100
- Equity says.
- Did you ever love me?

1600
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:04,000
How are we gonna
do the show without musicians?

1601
01:29:04,100 --> 01:29:06,000
- The show's off.
- We can't do the show.

1602
01:29:09,300 --> 01:29:12,700
- We're not dead yet.
- Our unions won't let us do the show.

1603
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:16,600
- What reason did they give?
- I say stop, you say go. You're an evil man, jack.

1604
01:29:16,700 --> 01:29:19,600
- Excuse me, jack.
- It means we can't do the show.

1605
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:22,600
It means it's over.
It's over, everybody.

1606
01:29:22,700 --> 01:29:25,400
Time to go home. Let's go, Olive.
This show's a disaster.

1607
01:29:25,500 --> 01:29:28,000
- Excuse me.
- Not now, George.

1608
01:29:28,100 --> 01:29:30,900
- What if we do it anyway?
- And be kicked out of the union?

1609
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,800
Not be able to work?
I can't risk that.

1610
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:35,300
- We thought so too. It's...
- Excuse me!

1611
01:29:35,400 --> 01:29:38,000
- What?
- I found a theater.

1612
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:41,400
The Venice, 59th and 7 th.
The owner wants a hundred bucks.

1613
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:43,300
- Tell him no.
- What?

1614
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:45,700
- It's over, George!
- Jack! Jack!

1615
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:49,500
I found a piano!
Where am I going?

1616
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:52,600
We're not doing the show.
We've been censured.

1617
01:29:54,900 --> 01:29:57,000
Well.

1618
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:00,500
I found a piano. There's a crowd out
there. Why not do it in the street?

1619
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:04,800
We have a theater. It's the actors.
They've been forbidden.

1620
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:08,000
Well.
Why not let Marc do it?

1621
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,100
By himself,
all the characters, yeah.

1622
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:12,400
- He did it for us.
- I know, but it's not gonna be any good.

1623
01:30:12,500 --> 01:30:15,600
- What's not gonna be any good?
- Besides, he's in the union.

1624
01:30:15,700 --> 01:30:18,000
Marc,

1625
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:20,600
are you in the...
musicians union?

1626
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:22,500
No. Why?

1627
01:30:22,500 --> 01:30:25,100
You have established the precedent
of exhibiting a play...

1628
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:28,600
that champions the cause
of public ownership of utilities.

1629
01:30:28,700 --> 01:30:31,900
You said you thought that was
proper and you had a right to do that.

1630
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:35,700
- I think so.
- And if the same play proved that the public ownership...

1631
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:39,200
of railroads was a good thing,
you would do it too, would you not?

1632
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:41,500
Absolutely. And the test is,
is it a good play...

1633
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:45,100
And if someone came with a play
showing that the public ownership...

1634
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:48,000
of all the lands
in the United States,

1635
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:52,000
and it was a good play,
you would do that too, would you not?

1636
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:55,400
That is a very clever move on your part
to maneuver me into a certain position. 

1637
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:58,800
- I do not pretend to any cleverness.
- No, I would not.

1638
01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:01,300
We would stop at that because
that would be recommending...

1639
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:04,500
the overthrow of the United States
government, and I do not want that,

1640
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:07,500
gentlemen, whatever some of
the previous witnesses have intimated.

1641
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:12,600
In other words, you would favor doing
it by degrees, but not all at once.

1642
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:15,700
Isn't that right?

1643
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:21,100
It is a degree that
the Congress has passed upon, isn't it?

1644
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:23,100
- Not yet.
- You did at one time. 

1645
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:25,300
- Not that I know of.
- During the war?

1646
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:31,200
I want you all to know that
I resent this silent treatment,

1647
01:31:31,300 --> 01:31:34,400
this subtle torture that
you are all subjecting me to.

1648
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:37,900
It is not easy being the one
that stands up and says the truth.

1649
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
You all know that there are
Communists amongst you.

1650
01:31:40,100 --> 01:31:42,000
You all know
that you date Negroes.

1651
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,900
You all know
that you are antifascist.

1652
01:31:43,900 --> 01:31:46,900
I say the pox on you and your house.
I will not tolerate this abuse.

1653
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:58,400
What a hero you are.

1654
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:03,800
Mr. Noble-Rat-On-His-Friends-
Now-Everybody-Gets-Fired Crickshaw.

1655
01:32:03,900 --> 01:32:07,600
What a hypocrite.
You believed in something once, Tommy.

1656
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:09,800
Shut up.

1657
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:16,200
Where have you come Tommy Crickshaw?

1658
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:20,600
Where's the young comrade
I once knew?

1659
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:22,800
Let's do the old act.

1660
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:26,300
One more time,
for old times' sake?

1661
01:32:26,400 --> 01:32:28,300
Come on, Tommy.

1662
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:35,900
The federal government
and the actors and musicians union... 

1663
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:39,700
- Sophie!
- have collectively forbidden us from performing this play. 

1664
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:41,600
- Daddy, what's happening?
- They've shut down the show.

1665
01:32:41,700 --> 01:32:43,500
- The government?
- No, the union.

1666
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:46,600
At this time, the composer of Cradle Will
Rock, not being a member of the union, 

1667
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:48,700
will be performing the play
by himself...

1668
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:52,400
on the stage of the Venice Theater,
21 blocks north...

1669
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:54,300
on 59th and 7 th.

1670
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:57,200
You're all invited to join us.
Thank you.

1671
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:59,200
- Where is it?
- 59th and 7 th.

1672
01:32:59,300 --> 01:33:01,100
- You gonna go?
- I don't think so.

1673
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:05,600
Every major newspaper critic in New York
is here, Marc. You can't let them down.

1674
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:08,800
You better be good. This is huge.
A thousand people.

1675
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:11,600
The Rome Theater,
57 th and 9th.

1676
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:14,700
We should support Marc.
He'll be terrified playing on his own.

1677
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:17,500
Our union has forbidden us
from performing in this show.

1678
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:20,500
If we even go to that theater,
we could lose our jobs. I'm leaving.

1679
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:23,100
You can either come with me
or find somewhere else to sleep.

1680
01:33:23,100 --> 01:33:25,700
- You're kicking me out?
- Come now or find somewhere else to sleep.

1681
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:27,700
Understand?

1682
01:33:44,100 --> 01:33:47,000
Mrs. Flanagan, we have had a long day, and
your testimony has been most illuminating.

1683
01:33:47,100 --> 01:33:49,100
We will hear
from Mr. Alsberg tomorrow. 

1684
01:33:49,200 --> 01:33:51,200
We will adjourn
for the evening.

1685
01:33:51,300 --> 01:33:54,000
Just a minute, gentlemen! Do I
understand this concludes my testimony?

1686
01:33:54,100 --> 01:33:55,900
We will see about it tomorrow. 

1687
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,300
I would like to make a final statement,
if I may, Congressman Dies.

1688
01:33:58,300 --> 01:34:01,700
Mrs. Flanagan, it is very late.
We shall see about it tomorrow. 

1689
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:04,300
Chairman Dies, this committee
has heard testimony...

1690
01:34:04,300 --> 01:34:06,700
for five and a half months
from unqualified witnesses.

1691
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:10,900
As head of the Federal Theater, I must
insist on more time to refute this testimony.

1692
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,900
It is only fair and decent,
sir.

1693
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:15,300
Whoa, let's not talk about
decency, Mrs. Flanagan.

1694
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:18,500
The Federal Theater is hardly
a judge of that. Now excuse me, ma'am.

1695
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:21,700
Mrs. Flanagan, any comment
on the proceedings?

1696
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:24,300
They're chasing ghosts. I hope to
further repudiate their charges tomorrow.

1697
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:28,100
- What is going on, Harry?
- You made Starnes look like a fool and he's furious.

1698
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:30,400
I mean, Marlowe a Communist?

1699
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:33,200
- They have to allow me to continue.
- They're not asking you back.

1700
01:34:33,300 --> 01:34:36,900
- I have had six hours! It's not fair!
- You're embarrassing them.

1701
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,700
- Hazel Huffman had three days. She's a clerk.
- You're too smart for them.

1702
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:42,900
I'm head of the project.
I must be allowed to continue.

1703
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:46,500
- You have to talk to Roosevelt.
- The committee is not interested in reason and intelligence.

1704
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:50,100
- This is their show and they are writing you out of it.
- Did you hear me?

1705
01:34:50,200 --> 01:34:52,000
- Did you hear me?
- Roosevelt can make it happen.

1706
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:55,200
- One press release and I'll be back in the morning.
- This is not going to happen.

1707
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:58,700
- What are you saying?
- This is not going to happen. Roosevelt is saving his fights.

1708
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:04,900
This is politics, Hallie.
Give a little, get a little.

1709
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:10,800
Exquisite, exquisite.

1710
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:14,100
Congratulations.
It is a perfect fit.

1711
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:18,000
You know, the next time we see
each other, we'll probably be at war.

1712
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:21,100
I hope not.
I hope it can be avoided.

1713
01:35:21,100 --> 01:35:23,400
Probably not.

1714
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:25,500
Probably not. 

1715
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:03,600
Down with Rockefeller!

1716
01:36:10,700 --> 01:36:12,600
Your friend Rockefeller
shut me out!

1717
01:36:12,700 --> 01:36:14,700
Lenin in a capitalist's lobby.
What were you expecting?

1718
01:36:14,700 --> 01:36:17,200
- I was dragged out like a common criminal.
- You were hired to do a job.

1719
01:36:17,300 --> 01:36:21,200
Now your boss does not like what you did.
Paint your revolution at you own expense.

1720
01:36:21,300 --> 01:36:23,900
Go paint a mural for nothing
at the Young Communists League.

1721
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:26,800
Because I take Rockefeller's
money, now I am his slave?

1722
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:30,200
- Yes!
- Oh! When did you stop supporting artists?

1723
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:34,000
I support your art, but that does not
mean that I must support your revolution.

1724
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,100
- It's the same thing!
- No, it is not.

1725
01:36:36,100 --> 01:36:38,500
What a lie you live.
Ajewish Fascist.

1726
01:36:38,500 --> 01:36:40,800
And you,
a wealthy Communist.

1727
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:05,000
Should I do a character
description? No, I probably... 

1728
01:37:05,100 --> 01:37:07,700
- I shouldn't do a character description, right?
- Don't worry...

1729
01:37:07,800 --> 01:37:09,800
- Shut up, jack.
- You shut up!

1730
01:37:09,900 --> 01:37:12,000
- Please, please, please.
- You'll be fine, Marc.

1731
01:37:12,100 --> 01:37:16,700
Um, there are seven duets in the piece.
What am I gonna do about those?

1732
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:40,200
- Dad, why did they have guns?
- Seems strange, doesn't it.

1733
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:43,300
- You're not doing the play?
- Because the government says we can't.

1734
01:37:43,300 --> 01:37:45,200
- But you want to do it?
- Yes.

1735
01:37:45,300 --> 01:37:48,200
- Is it against the law?
- No, but they're my boss,

1736
01:37:48,300 --> 01:37:50,200
and they pay me and they say
we can't do the show.

1737
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:53,500
But you still want to do it,
so why don't you do it already?

1738
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:57,200
'Cause I can't. It's been forbidden.
And I could lose my job.

1739
01:38:00,700 --> 01:38:02,600
It'll ruin my career. 

1740
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:04,800
The only person who can
ruin your career is you.

1741
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:06,800
- Oh, shut up. You snake in the grass.
- You shut up. 

1742
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:09,400
- I never want to work with you again. Ever.
- I'm never gonna work with you.

1743
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:12,000
- I never want to work with you again.
- I never want to work with you.

1744
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:13,900
Do be careful.
Don't hurt yourself.

1745
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:17,900
- Oh, look at those lights.
They're wonderful.

1746
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Constance, what on Earth
are you doing?

1747
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,600
I'm getting the piano
off the truck!

1748
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:25,300
Oh, my heavens! Darling! I was supposed
to meet you at home an hour ago.

1749
01:38:25,300 --> 01:38:27,700
I've failed you miserably.
I do hope you'll forgive me.

1750
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:30,000
You look splendid, Gray, darling.
Have you got any money?

1751
01:38:30,100 --> 01:38:32,700
- I'd like to give these generous men a gratuity.
- Get in the car.

1752
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:34,600
- Why, dear?
- We're going home.

1753
01:38:34,700 --> 01:38:37,200
- Darling, we'll miss the performance.
- That certainly is my intention.

1754
01:38:37,300 --> 01:38:39,600
Don't make me choose between
Marie Antoinette and this evening.

1755
01:38:39,700 --> 01:38:42,400
I'll never forgive you if you make
me miss this performance tonight.

1756
01:38:43,900 --> 01:38:46,700
Oh. Good Lord.
It's a revolution.

1757
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:48,700
- It's the audience!
- Get in the car.

1758
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:51,300
Carlo, would you please
give me and my husband some privacy?

1759
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:53,300
- Nyet. Merci.
- james, go!

1760
01:38:53,300 --> 01:38:56,600
James, stay. When did you become
such a stick in the mud?

1761
01:38:56,700 --> 01:38:59,300
Oh, stop it!
We're going home!

1762
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:01,800
My wife has gone completely mad.
Get in the car!

1763
01:39:01,900 --> 01:39:04,400
- Now!
- Perhaps you've mistaken me for a spaniel.

1764
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:06,400
If you don't get in the car,
I will cut off your allowance.

1765
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:08,300
You'll do nothing of the kind.

1766
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:11,300
And if you do, then I'll
have to live as a gypsy does.

1767
01:39:11,400 --> 01:39:14,500
Constance!

1768
01:39:14,600 --> 01:39:17,000
Orson, jack, we've got the piano!
Come, come!

1769
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:40,800
You know times are hard
when I look at you and see firewood.

1770
01:39:40,900 --> 01:39:43,300
- Hey, what are you saying?
- Why, my oaken friend,

1771
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:45,800
- Mr. Roosevelt has laid us off.
- Cutbacks?

1772
01:39:45,900 --> 01:39:48,900
- Politics.
- I told you you shouldn't have ratted on my friends.

1773
01:39:50,100 --> 01:39:52,400
- Friends?
- Uh-oh.

1774
01:39:52,400 --> 01:39:55,600
Did you say friends?
Those Reds are your friends?

1775
01:39:55,700 --> 01:39:58,600
- Sorry, comrade.
- Comrade?

1776
01:39:58,700 --> 01:40:02,600
We are all comrades, and we will not
rest until all of the country is Red.

1777
01:40:02,700 --> 01:40:04,700
I've known this dummy
like the back of my hand, I swear.

1778
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:06,800
In my own hand,
a revolutionary?

1779
01:40:06,900 --> 01:40:11,500
Ladies and gentlemen, this man
exploits my labor for his own profits.

1780
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:15,000
This capitalist pays me zero,
works me whenever he likes.

1781
01:40:15,100 --> 01:40:17,800
I sleep in
a coffin-like apartment!

1782
01:40:17,900 --> 01:40:20,200
- You're a dummy!
- Dummies!

1783
01:40:20,300 --> 01:40:24,600
- This is what he calls us, brothers and sisters.
- Not you folks.

1784
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:29,700
If it is dummies we are,
then I say, "Dummies, rise up!

1785
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:32,500
Rise up to the proletarian call
of dummies everywhere!

1786
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:36,400
Storm the barricades!
Riot in the streets!"

1787
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:38,300
- Give him the hook!
-Arise, ye prisoners

1788
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:40,300
Of starvation

1789
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:43,400
Arise, ye wretched
of the Earth

1790
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:46,700
- Forjustice thunders condemnation
- Get off the stage!

1791
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:50,600
A better world in birth

1792
01:40:50,700 --> 01:40:53,400
Then, comrades, come rally

1793
01:40:53,400 --> 01:40:57,900
And the last fight
let us face

1794
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:01,200
The Internationale

1795
01:41:01,300 --> 01:41:05,900
Unites the human race

1796
01:41:44,900 --> 01:41:47,900
And Aristophanes
was definitely a Communist. 

1797
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,300
So are we through?
Is this it?

1798
01:41:50,300 --> 01:41:54,900
- Should I be looking for a job?
- We've got another year, if we fight.

1799
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:58,300
You know, I can understand the puritans,
I can understand the politics,

1800
01:41:58,300 --> 01:42:01,100
but I guess I don't understand
the passion of it.

1801
01:42:01,100 --> 01:42:04,800
- The intense anger.
- It's not just anger, it's fear.

1802
01:42:04,900 --> 01:42:08,900
- Fear?
- Mr. O'Hara, have you ever heard of Michael Grunwald?

1803
01:42:08,900 --> 01:42:12,500
- What, was he a Communist?
- No. Mr. De Rohan?

1804
01:42:12,600 --> 01:42:16,900
Michael Grunwald, an historian, Elizabethan
England. Not a Communist as far as I can tell. 

1805
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:19,200
Mr. O'Hara, have you read
any of his books?

1806
01:42:19,300 --> 01:42:23,600
- Uh, no, Congressman Flanagan.
I skipped that course.

1807
01:42:23,700 --> 01:42:25,500
But you know your history
of Elizabethan England.

1808
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:29,200
- Yes. From Shakespeare, Madam Chairman.
- A playwright. I see.

1809
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:33,200
- Mr. O'Hara, who was Richard III?
- A humpback and a killer.

1810
01:42:33,300 --> 01:42:37,000
Mr. De Rohan, what is Michael
Grunwald's opinion of Richard III?

1811
01:42:37,100 --> 01:42:42,700
Michael Grunwald would say that Richard
llI was a great ruler and much maligned.

1812
01:42:42,700 --> 01:42:46,000
And yet this Shakespeare has written
a play which is still performed,

1813
01:42:46,100 --> 01:42:48,900
while Mr. Grunwald's books
gather dust.

1814
01:42:48,900 --> 01:42:51,800
Would you consider that unfair,
Mr. De Rohan?

1815
01:42:51,800 --> 01:42:55,200
Why, yes. I would say that this
Mr. Shakespeare should be investigated.

1816
01:42:55,300 --> 01:42:57,700
And if all else fails,
we can remove his words.

1817
01:42:57,800 --> 01:43:00,200
Burn them. 

1818
01:43:00,300 --> 01:43:04,500
We're not painting
pretty pictures with our plays. 

1819
01:43:04,600 --> 01:43:06,400
It must scare
the hell out of them.

1820
01:43:06,500 --> 01:43:10,000
Well, the plays are written.
They're here forever.

1821
01:43:10,100 --> 01:43:12,400
Oh, I hope they are.

1822
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:17,200
Federal Theater
is going to end.

1823
01:43:17,200 --> 01:43:19,800
But theater is
going to be better off. 

1824
01:43:20,900 --> 01:43:24,400
We've launched a ship,

1825
01:43:24,500 --> 01:43:27,600
a grand and glorious ship.

1826
01:43:38,300 --> 01:43:40,300
How come
they did that, Dad?

1827
01:43:40,300 --> 01:43:42,700
You should ask your uncle.
That's his flag.

1828
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:49,100
Olive!

1829
01:43:50,700 --> 01:43:52,600
- Hi.
- I thought you went home.

1830
01:43:52,700 --> 01:43:55,800
Um, I don't have a home now.

1831
01:43:55,800 --> 01:43:57,700
He kicked you out?

1832
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:03,700
Can I sleep
on your floor tonight?

1833
01:44:03,700 --> 01:44:05,700
Sure.

1834
01:44:05,800 --> 01:44:07,700
I didn't want to miss this.

1835
01:44:11,800 --> 01:44:14,700
What in God's name were
you expecting from a Communist?

1836
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:17,300
I wouldn't have had this
problem with Picasso or Matisse. 

1837
01:44:17,400 --> 01:44:22,100
We control the future of art
because we pay for the future of art. 

1838
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:25,900
Appoint people to your museum boards
that detest the Rivera's of this world.

1839
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:30,100
Celebrate the Matisses.
Create the next wave of art.

1840
01:44:30,200 --> 01:44:33,000
You have the purse strings.
It's quite obvious you have the power.

1841
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:34,900
- Cultural power.
- Yes.

1842
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,800
- To pay for the Matisse.
- Celebrate colors.

1843
01:44:36,900 --> 01:44:39,000
- Celebrate form.
- Portraits.

1844
01:44:39,100 --> 01:44:41,500
- Countrysides.
- Men on horses.

1845
01:44:41,500 --> 01:44:43,800
- Sunsets. Nudes.
- Oh, yes.

1846
01:44:56,600 --> 01:44:59,100
Ladies and gentlemen!

1847
01:44:59,200 --> 01:45:02,100
Welcome to the first runaway
production of the Federal Theater.

1848
01:45:02,200 --> 01:45:06,700
I'm sure that you are aware
by now of the circumstances...

1849
01:45:06,700 --> 01:45:10,000
that have led us to this dusty theater
on this beautiful summer night.

1850
01:45:10,100 --> 01:45:13,700
Something in this play
frightens people in Washington.

1851
01:45:13,800 --> 01:45:16,900
There must be some sinister
force at work in this play.

1852
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,700
So without further ado,

1853
01:45:21,700 --> 01:45:25,100
allow me to introduce to you the
monster behind The Cradle Will Rock, 

1854
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:27,600
Mr. Marc Blitzstein.

1855
01:45:38,700 --> 01:45:40,500
Good evening.

1856
01:45:40,600 --> 01:45:43,900
Fade to black and we're
in Steeltown, U. S. A.

1857
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:48,900
A prostitute walks down the street
and stops under a streetlamp.

1858
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,100
This is Moll.

1859
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:53,200
- Play.
- She sings:

1860
01:45:57,500 --> 01:46:01,600
I'm checkin' home now

1861
01:46:01,700 --> 01:46:04,700
Call it a night

1862
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:09,200
Goin' up to my room

1863
01:46:09,200 --> 01:46:12,500
Turn on the light

1864
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:16,700
Jesus

1865
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:20,900
Turn off that light

1866
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:26,000
I ain't in Steeltown long

1867
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:29,500
I work two days a week

1868
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:36,200
The other five
my efforts ain't required

1869
01:46:36,300 --> 01:46:39,400
For two days out of seven

1870
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:43,100
Two dollar bills
I'm given

1871
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:48,300
So I'm just searchin'

1872
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:52,200
Along the street

1873
01:46:52,300 --> 01:46:56,600
For on those five days

1874
01:46:56,600 --> 01:47:01,400
It's nice to eat

1875
01:47:01,500 --> 01:47:07,800
jesus

1876
01:47:07,900 --> 01:47:12,600
Who said let's eat

1877
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:22,000
Enter a well-dressed gentleman...

1878
01:47:24,500 --> 01:47:27,800
- Enter a well-dressed gentleman
who's on the make. 

1879
01:47:29,300 --> 01:47:32,200
Uh, okay.
Enter me.

1880
01:47:35,700 --> 01:47:38,300
I'd like to give you
a hundred bucks

1881
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:42,300
But I only got 30 cents

1882
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:44,700
Nelson will fund the new wave of art. 

1883
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:48,600
A traveling exhibit throughout Europe,
highlighting American artists.

1884
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:52,900
- Nonpolitical.
- Yes, abstract. Colors and form, not politics. 

1885
01:47:52,900 --> 01:47:55,800
My papers will hail it
as the next new thing. 

1886
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:59,700
We'll canonize the artists,
make them rich.

1887
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:02,900
And soon enough, all artists will be
doing the next new thing.

1888
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
You think? There's
something about artists...

1889
01:48:05,100 --> 01:48:07,700
- that always gets socially concerned.
- That's true.

1890
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:10,500
- They won't get paid for it.
- They won't be seen. They'll have no influence.

1891
01:48:10,600 --> 01:48:13,600
Rather than starve, they'll adapt.
It's survival.

1892
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:16,900
And artists are whores,
like the rest of us.

1893
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:21,500
Maybe you wonder what it is

1894
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:25,000
Makes people good or bad

1895
01:48:25,100 --> 01:48:26,900
Why some guy

1896
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:30,100
An ace without a doubt

1897
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:33,700
Turns out to be a bastard

1898
01:48:33,700 --> 01:48:38,200
And the other way about

1899
01:48:38,200 --> 01:48:42,100
I'll tell you what I feel

1900
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:47,100
It's just the nickel
under the heel

1901
01:48:49,200 --> 01:48:52,000
Go stand on someone's neck

1902
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,100
While you're takin'

1903
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:58,900
Cut into somebody's throat
as you put

1904
01:48:58,900 --> 01:49:02,000
For every dream
and scheme's

1905
01:49:02,100 --> 01:49:04,400
Depending on whether

1906
01:49:04,500 --> 01:49:08,100
All through the storm

1907
01:49:08,200 --> 01:49:11,900
You've kept it warm

1908
01:49:13,100 --> 01:49:16,200
That nickel under your foot

1909
01:49:27,200 --> 01:49:30,100
Scene two. We're now
in a holding cell.

1910
01:49:30,200 --> 01:49:32,300
Moll sits there,
depressed, 

1911
01:49:32,300 --> 01:49:37,600
as Larry Foreman, a union leader,
is thrown in there with her.

1912
01:49:37,700 --> 01:49:40,200
He says...

1913
01:49:48,200 --> 01:49:51,400
Ohhhhh!

1914
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:55,400
Ohhhhh!

1915
01:49:57,300 --> 01:50:00,500
Daddy!

1916
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:03,300
Boy!

1917
01:50:08,600 --> 01:50:12,400
- I just been grilled!
- Ooh, you been hit good.

1918
01:50:12,500 --> 01:50:15,100
You're new here. What's the matter?
They catch you on the streets?

1919
01:50:15,100 --> 01:50:17,000
Uh-huh.
What'd they get you for?

1920
01:50:17,100 --> 01:50:20,300
Who me? Makin'a speech
and passin'out leaflets. 

1921
01:50:20,300 --> 01:50:25,100
The formal charge is incitin' a riot.
Ain't you ever seen my act?

1922
01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:28,900
Well, I'm creepin'
along in the dark. 

1923
01:50:28,900 --> 01:50:31,000
My eyes is crafty.

1924
01:50:31,100 --> 01:50:34,200
My pockets is bulgin'.
I'm loaded!

1925
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:38,200
Armed to the teeth...
with leaflets!

1926
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:44,700
I come up to you
very slow, very sneaky. 

1927
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:49,200
And with one fell gesture,
I tuck a leaflet in your hand.

1928
01:50:49,300 --> 01:50:51,200
One. 

1929
01:50:51,200 --> 01:50:54,900
Two. Three.
Oh! There's a riot!

1930
01:50:56,300 --> 01:51:00,500
You're the riot! I incited you!
I'm terrific, I am.

1931
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,900
Scene three.
A night court.

1932
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:10,600
Enter the Liberty Committee.

1933
01:51:10,600 --> 01:51:14,200
Say! What's the whole Liberty
Committee doin'in a night court?

1934
01:51:14,200 --> 01:51:16,600
And on the other side
of the bars?

1935
01:51:16,700 --> 01:51:18,900
Think of what my people would
think if they could see me. 

1936
01:51:18,900 --> 01:51:20,900
You know, Mr. Mister.

1937
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,000
He'll come and bail us out!

1938
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:25,600
Phone for Mr. Mister
to come and bail us out.

1939
01:51:25,700 --> 01:51:28,400
We're the most respectable
families in the city.

1940
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:31,200
- We're Steeltown's Liberty Committee.
- We're against the union. 

1941
01:51:31,300 --> 01:51:35,800
- We're against the drive.
- Why, I drew up the manifesto. 

1942
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:39,500
Steeltown is clean

1943
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:42,900
Steeltown's a real town

1944
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:46,100
We don't want a union

1945
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:50,300
In Steeltown

1946
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,400
I am the Reverend Salvation.

1947
01:51:57,400 --> 01:52:01,100
We have formed the Liberty Committee
to combat against socialism,

1948
01:52:01,200 --> 01:52:06,300
Communism, radicalism
and especially unionism.

1949
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:09,500
- I'm the editor of the Steeltown News.
- I'm his personal doctor. 

1950
01:52:09,600 --> 01:52:13,900
And I'm Mr. Mister's personal wife.
Mr. Mister's Mrs. Missus.

1951
01:52:13,900 --> 01:52:16,500
I'm his daughter,
Sister Mister. 

1952
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:18,600
I'm his son,
Junior Mister.

1953
01:52:18,700 --> 01:52:21,400
- Who is this Mr. Mister?
- Better ask who he's not.

1954
01:52:21,400 --> 01:52:23,600
He owns steel and everything else. 

1955
01:52:23,700 --> 01:52:26,900
So Mr. Mister
please take pity

1956
01:52:26,900 --> 01:52:30,900
Come and save
your pet committee

1957
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:34,700
From disaster

1958
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:49,700
First case.
Name?

1959
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:54,100
- Reverend Salvation.
- Habitual prostitute since 1915.

1960
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:57,600
So sayeth it in the Bible

1961
01:52:57,700 --> 01:53:00,900
So must it be

1962
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:05,900
Thou shalt not kill

1963
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:10,500
Peace on earth
Toward men goodwill

1964
01:53:10,600 --> 01:53:14,000
Only goodwill

1965
01:53:14,100 --> 01:53:19,100
As your shepherd I implore

1966
01:53:19,100 --> 01:53:22,700
Turn from thoughts
of wicked war

1967
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:26,400
War we do abhor

1968
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:29,600
Let's do something
before we've got too old

1969
01:53:29,700 --> 01:53:32,500
I'm glad I'm not too old
to tie a can to a doggie's tail

1970
01:53:32,600 --> 01:53:37,600
Let's raise chickens, raise the dickens,
go to church and be on time for excitement

1971
01:53:37,700 --> 01:53:40,200
And indictment would be swell
if we invent a crime

1972
01:53:40,300 --> 01:53:43,500
Let's do something
to kill the monotony

1973
01:53:43,600 --> 01:53:46,800
Let's go in for botany
if they've got any And if not any

1974
01:53:46,900 --> 01:53:50,700
So we must set the tone right,
please don't be quite so downright

1975
01:53:50,700 --> 01:53:53,600
Simply answer
both yes and no

1976
01:53:53,700 --> 01:53:57,800
It's true You've preached
so much for peace

1977
01:53:57,800 --> 01:54:00,500
But now it seems
that peace

1978
01:54:00,600 --> 01:54:03,000
May be
a little expensive

1979
01:54:03,100 --> 01:54:05,000
Please don't
think me offensive

1980
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:08,100
Just restrain
your intensive ardor

1981
01:54:08,200 --> 01:54:11,100
Oh, the press, the press
The freedom of the press

1982
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:13,700
You'll never take away
the freedom of the press

1983
01:54:13,700 --> 01:54:16,700
-That Foreman series now
-Yes, Mr. Mister, yes

1984
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:19,300
With a hey-diddle-dee
and a ho-nonny

1985
01:54:19,400 --> 01:54:21,200
- No
- No?

1986
01:54:21,200 --> 01:54:24,200
Yes, Mr. Mister, yes!

1987
01:54:24,200 --> 01:54:28,000
For whichever side will pay
the best

1988
01:54:28,100 --> 01:54:30,000
All you clergymen must now prepare

1989
01:54:30,100 --> 01:54:32,300
A special prayer
and do your share

1990
01:54:32,400 --> 01:54:34,400
Oh, yes, your share

1991
01:54:34,500 --> 01:54:37,200
Thou shalt...

1992
01:54:37,300 --> 01:54:41,200
War, war Kill all the dirty Huns
and those Austro-Hungarians

1993
01:54:41,300 --> 01:54:43,800
War, war
We're entering the war

1994
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:45,600
Make the world safe
for democracy

1995
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:47,200
Make the world safe
for liberty

1996
01:54:47,200 --> 01:54:50,200
Make the world safe for steel
and the Mister family

1997
01:54:50,200 --> 01:54:53,500
Of course
it's peace we're for

1998
01:54:53,500 --> 01:54:56,300
This is war to end

1999
01:54:56,400 --> 01:54:59,400
All war

2000
01:54:59,400 --> 01:55:02,000
Amen

2001
01:55:02,100 --> 01:55:05,900
I can see the market rising
like a beautiful bird

2002
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,100
Collection!

2003
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:23,200
Mr. Mister!

2004
01:55:23,300 --> 01:55:25,500
Where have you been, sir?

2005
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:29,900
- You're Larry Foreman!
- You're Larry Foreman!

2006
01:55:33,700 --> 01:55:37,800
- Ex-foreman.
- I've been...

2007
01:55:41,900 --> 01:55:43,500
I've been...

2008
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:48,100
Looking...

2009
01:55:49,300 --> 01:55:51,500
I've been looking
all over town for you.

2010
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:54,000
Yeah? Well,
how's the union returns?

2011
01:55:54,100 --> 01:55:57,600
Well, they haven't... Haven't
come back with a decision yet. 

2012
01:55:57,700 --> 01:56:01,200
Mr. Foreman, I know
a lot about you.

2013
01:56:01,200 --> 01:56:03,700
- Yeah?
- You were once in my employ. 

2014
01:56:03,800 --> 01:56:06,000
Now look, we both
want the same thing. 

2015
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,600
A fair, square deal
for everybody.

2016
01:56:08,600 --> 01:56:11,100
Why don't you
persuade your union...

2017
01:56:11,200 --> 01:56:14,900
to join with the Liberty Committee
in one great big united organization?

2018
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:16,800
Thank you.

2019
01:56:16,900 --> 01:56:18,800
Let me understand you. 

2020
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:23,400
You'd like my services in swinging your
way all the people I have signed up.

2021
01:56:23,400 --> 01:56:26,300
All the people who agree
with the union.

2022
01:56:26,300 --> 01:56:30,100
You want me
to change their minds.

2023
01:56:30,100 --> 01:56:32,000
- Is that it?
-That's it That's it

2024
01:56:32,100 --> 01:56:36,200
- Now do it
- That's rather strongly put. 

2025
01:56:36,300 --> 01:56:38,800
Oughta be worth
quite a sum to you, eh?

2026
01:56:38,900 --> 01:56:41,800
I thought so.
Every man has his price.

2027
01:56:41,900 --> 01:56:46,900
And every day is a wonderland tour

2028
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:51,400
Oh, you can dream
and scheme and happily put

2029
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:54,500
Then take, take and put

2030
01:56:54,600 --> 01:56:58,600
But first be sure

2031
01:56:58,700 --> 01:57:01,200
The nickel's under your foot

2032
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:06,300
And if you're sweet
then you'll grow rotten

2033
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:11,200
Wait! I'm kinda funny that way. I'd like
to know now how much it might be worth.

2034
01:57:11,200 --> 01:57:14,500
Who do you think you are?
Go on! Go on!

2035
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:18,300
That's Mr. Mister making you
an offer! Take it! Take it!

2036
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:21,000
Making you an offer!
Mr. Mister!

2037
01:57:25,500 --> 01:57:27,500
You don't say.

2038
01:57:27,600 --> 01:57:29,500
Worth that much
to you, eh?

2039
01:57:32,300 --> 01:57:34,700
Well, you take
all that money...

2040
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:39,100
and you go buy yourself
a big piece of toast!

2041
01:57:45,700 --> 01:57:49,100
- Idiot!
- Marvelous!

2042
01:57:50,900 --> 01:57:53,300
Now then,
get outta here!

2043
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:55,700
Hooray!

2044
01:57:59,300 --> 01:58:02,300
And take this little girl
with ya!

2045
01:58:02,300 --> 01:58:05,000
Out there,
she doesn't cost ya nothin'!

2046
01:58:05,100 --> 01:58:08,300
In jail, you're liable
to have to feed her!

2047
01:58:08,300 --> 01:58:12,400
Why, you goddamned skunk. I'll break
you. I'll drive you outta town.

2048
01:58:12,500 --> 01:58:14,600
- Lynch him!
- Get rid of him!

2049
01:58:14,700 --> 01:58:18,800
Yes, lynch! Kill!

2050
01:58:18,900 --> 01:58:22,500
Listen once and for all,
ya scared bunch of ninnies!

2051
01:58:22,500 --> 01:58:24,500
Outside in the square,
they're startin' something...

2052
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:27,800
that's gonna tear the cat gut
outta your stinkin' rackets.

2053
01:58:27,800 --> 01:58:29,700
That's steel
marchin' out in front.

2054
01:58:29,700 --> 01:58:33,800
The people in this town
are findin' out what it's all about.

2055
01:58:33,900 --> 01:58:35,700
They're growin' up.

2056
01:58:35,800 --> 01:58:39,900
And when everybody gets together
like steel's getting together tonight,

2057
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:42,000
where are ya then?

2058
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:45,200
Listen, you black legions!

2059
01:58:45,300 --> 01:58:47,300
You Ku Kluxers!

2060
01:58:47,300 --> 01:58:52,000
You vigilantes hidin' up there
in the cradle of the Liberty Committee!

2061
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:54,200
When the storm breaks,

2062
01:58:54,300 --> 01:58:57,200
the cradle will fall!

2063
01:59:02,600 --> 01:59:06,700
Listen! The boilermakers are with us!

2064
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:10,900
That's the boilermakers' kids. 

2065
01:59:10,900 --> 01:59:14,100
The roughers, the rollers!

2066
01:59:14,200 --> 01:59:19,300
Steel! Your steel!
They done it!

2067
01:59:19,400 --> 01:59:23,800
- Hey, they're marchin' down here.
- Ain't got no permit to march.

2068
01:59:23,800 --> 01:59:27,400
- Arrest them!
- Arrest 'em? There's thousands of 'em. 

2069
01:59:27,500 --> 01:59:30,100
They're standin' in front
of the courthouse. They're right here. 

2070
01:59:30,200 --> 01:59:32,700
- My God. What do they want with me?
- Don't worry.

2071
01:59:32,700 --> 01:59:34,900
That's not for you.
That's just a union marching.

2072
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:37,100
And then they put out their hands

2073
01:59:37,200 --> 01:59:39,900
And feel stormy weather

2074
01:59:39,900 --> 01:59:42,300
A birdie ups and cries

2075
01:59:42,300 --> 01:59:44,400
"Boys, this looks bad"

2076
01:59:44,500 --> 01:59:46,900
You haven't used your eyes

2077
01:59:46,900 --> 01:59:49,100
You'll wish you had

2078
01:59:49,100 --> 01:59:52,000
That's thunder
That's lightning

2079
01:59:52,100 --> 01:59:55,800
And it's gonna surround you

2080
01:59:55,800 --> 01:59:58,300
No wonder those storm birds

2081
01:59:58,400 --> 02:00:01,200
Seem to circle around you

2082
02:00:01,300 --> 02:00:03,700
Well, you can't climb down

2083
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:05,900
And you can't sit still

2084
02:00:05,900 --> 02:00:08,000
That's a storm that's
gonna last until

2085
02:00:08,100 --> 02:00:12,100
The final wind blows
And when the wind blows

2086
02:00:12,200 --> 02:00:15,500
The cradle will rock

2087
02:00:15,600 --> 02:00:19,200
Yes!

2088
02:00:19,300 --> 02:00:21,900
That's thunder
That's lightning

2089
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,900
And it's gonna surround you

2090
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:27,800
No wonder those storm birds

2091
02:00:27,900 --> 02:00:31,200
Seem to circle around you

2092
02:00:31,200 --> 02:00:34,500
Well, you can't climb down
and you can't say no

2093
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:37,000
You can't stop the weather
Not with all your dough

2094
02:00:37,100 --> 02:00:41,800
For when the wind blows
Oh, when the wind blows

2095
02:00:41,900 --> 02:00:44,200
The cradle will rock

2096
02:00:51,100 --> 02:00:53,200
The cradle will rock

2097
02:01:47,200 --> 02:01:49,700
- I love you, baby!
- I love you!

2098
02:02:40,500 --> 02:02:42,600
The cradle will rock!

2099
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:08,400
Maybe you wonder
what it is

2100
02:04:09,800 --> 02:04:15,100
Makes people good or bad

2101
02:04:15,200 --> 02:04:17,600
Why some guy

2102
02:04:17,700 --> 02:04:22,700
An ace without a doubt

2103
02:04:22,700 --> 02:04:27,100
Turns out to be a bastard

2104
02:04:28,400 --> 02:04:32,700
And the other way about

2105
02:04:36,500 --> 02:04:41,700
I'll tell you what I feel

2106
02:04:41,800 --> 02:04:45,100
It's just the nickel

2107
02:04:45,200 --> 02:04:49,300
Under the heel

2108
02:04:52,500 --> 02:04:58,100
Oh, you can live
like hearts and flowers

2109
02:04:58,200 --> 02:05:03,500
And every day
is a wonderland tour

2110
02:05:03,500 --> 02:05:06,900
Oh, you can dream and scheme

2111
02:05:06,900 --> 02:05:10,600
And happily put and take

2112
02:05:10,700 --> 02:05:13,500
Take and put

2113
02:05:13,500 --> 02:05:16,800
But first be sure

2114
02:05:18,600 --> 02:05:21,900
That nickel's
under your foot

2115
02:05:25,400 --> 02:05:30,700
Go stand on someone's neck
while you're taking

2116
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:36,400
Cut into somebody's throat
as you put

2117
02:05:36,500 --> 02:05:39,700
For every dream and scheme

2118
02:05:39,800 --> 02:05:42,900
Depending on whether

2119
02:05:42,900 --> 02:05:46,400
All through the storm

2120
02:05:46,400 --> 02:05:51,300
You've kept it warm

2121
02:05:51,400 --> 02:05:55,200
That nickel under your foot

2122
02:05:58,500 --> 02:06:03,700
And if you're sweet
then you'll grow rotten

2123
02:06:03,800 --> 02:06:09,300
Your pretty heart
covered over with soot

2124
02:06:09,300 --> 02:06:12,700
And if for once you're gay

2125
02:06:12,800 --> 02:06:15,700
And devil-may-careless

2126
02:06:15,800 --> 02:06:19,300
And, oh, so hot

2127
02:06:19,300 --> 02:06:22,400
I'll know you've got

2128
02:06:24,500 --> 02:06:28,500
That nickel under your foot

2129
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:44,600
Croon, Croon till it hurts, baby

2130
02:06:44,600 --> 02:06:46,500
Croon

2131
02:06:46,600 --> 02:06:50,300
My heart asserts, baby
Croonin'in spurts, baby

2132
02:06:50,400 --> 02:06:54,000
Is just a nerts for a tune

2133
02:06:54,100 --> 02:06:57,400
Spoon in a canoe, baby

2134
02:06:57,500 --> 02:06:59,400
Spoon

2135
02:06:59,400 --> 02:07:03,100
One built for two, baby
Just me and you, baby

2136
02:07:03,200 --> 02:07:06,500
I can canoe, baby
Spoon

2137
02:07:06,600 --> 02:07:10,400
Oh, the crooner's life
is a blessed one

2138
02:07:10,400 --> 02:07:14,000
He makes
the population happy

2139
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:17,600
For when all his cares
have distressing one

2140
02:07:17,700 --> 02:07:21,600
A spoon is grand in the June-day sun

2141
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:25,000
You spoon and spoon
and never get tired

2142
02:07:25,100 --> 02:07:28,600
But it's nicer at night
than in the noonday sun

2143
02:07:28,700 --> 02:07:33,000
'Cause then you're Gary Cooper
and I'm Greta Garbo

2144
02:07:59,800 --> 02:08:02,100
Just croon

2145
02:08:02,100 --> 02:08:05,800
Even the poor
are not immune

2146
02:08:05,900 --> 02:08:09,600
If they're without a suit
they shouldn't give a hoot

2147
02:08:09,600 --> 02:08:12,700
When they can substitute

2148
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:17,100
Find me a dream man

2149
02:08:17,200 --> 02:08:22,100
And leave us in dreamland

2150
02:08:22,100 --> 02:08:25,900
Where me and my dream man

2151
02:08:25,900 --> 02:08:27,800
Can

2152
02:08:27,800 --> 02:08:31,300
When they can substitute

2153
02:08:31,300 --> 02:08:33,800
Croon

2154
02:08:33,800 --> 02:08:36,800
Spoon

2155
02:08:36,800 --> 02:08:40,200
And we love art
for art's sake

2156
02:08:40,300 --> 02:08:42,100
It's smart for art's sake

2157
02:08:42,200 --> 02:08:45,100
To part for art's sake with
your heart for art's sake

2158
02:08:45,200 --> 02:08:48,600
And your mind for art's sake
Be blind for art's sake

2159
02:08:48,600 --> 02:08:51,900
And deaf for art's sake
And young for art's sake

2160
02:08:51,900 --> 02:08:54,900
Until for art's sake
You kill for art's sake

2161
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:56,800
All the art for art's sake
