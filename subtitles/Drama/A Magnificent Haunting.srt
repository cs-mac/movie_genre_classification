1
00:02:11,215 --> 00:02:13,300
Hilario.

2
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,544
Papa!

3
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,001
Sotero!
My good friend.

4
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,794
How are ya?

5
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,971
You have a drink?

6
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:46,643
I can't tell you what
a pleasure it is to see a village like this.

7
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:55,569
Santos!

8
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,780
So much restlessness
and change in the outside world.

9
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:01,992
People no longer
content with their station in life.

10
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,995
Women's fashions?
Shameless.

11
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:07,623
Cigar.

12
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,708
Mire! Religion!

13
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:13,962
You'd weep if you saw how true religion is
now a thing of the past.

14
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:19,843
Last month we were
in San Juan - a rich town. Sit down.

15
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:23,931
Rich town,
much blessed by God.

16
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:26,558
Big church.

17
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:31,730
Not like here - little church,
priest comes twice a year. Big one!

18
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:35,734
You think we find gold candlesticks, poor
box filled to overflowing?

19
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,778
You know what we found?

20
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:41,365
Brass candlesticks,
almost nothing in the poor box.

21
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,992
But we took it anyway.

22
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:47,246
I know we took it anyway.

23
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:51,667
I'm trying to show him
how little religion some people now have.

24
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,044
That I could see
for myself.

25
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,549
Don't see!

26
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,052
What if you had
to carry my load, huh?

27
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:06,265
The need to provide food, like a father, to
fill the mouths of his hungry men.

28
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,433
Guns. Ammunition.

29
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:13,605
You know how much money
that costs? Huh? Huh?!

30
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:15,315
No.

31
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,651
The days of good
hunting are over.

32
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:22,781
Once there was horses,
cattle, gold, fruit from the trees. No more.

33
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:28,745
Now I must hunt with
a price on my head, rurales at my heels.

34
00:05:33,917 --> 00:05:36,003
I'll be back.

35
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,923
Enough!

36
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,059
We'll get
the rest when we come back.

37
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:59,318
I love this village.

38
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:01,862
I know you have
your problems...

39
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:04,281
Murderer! Thief!

40
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,709
Rafael!

41
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,085
Rafael...

42
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:19,421
Rafael!

43
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:26,428
Stupid!

44
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:31,558
We have to have
another discussion very soon.

45
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:35,896
It's always a pleasure to hear the views of
my good friend Sotero.

46
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,734
Maybe when
I come back, hm?

47
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:41,944
AdiГіs!

48
00:06:42,027 --> 00:06:44,112
Let's go!

49
00:07:15,978 --> 00:07:18,063
Help me bring him in.

50
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:42,754
If he steals
our harvest again,...

51
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:46,466
...we might as well
cut our throats and be done with it!

52
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:50,179
Leave the valley.
That's what we must do.

53
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:51,972
Live somewhere else?

54
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:55,517
Take our homes
with us? Our farms?

55
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:58,228
We... could
hide some food.

56
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:03,358
From Calvera?
He never steals all our food.

57
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:06,570
He leaves us
enough to go on with.

58
00:08:06,653 --> 00:08:07,863
That's something.

59
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,199
We could beg him
to leave us more.

60
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:14,703
No, no. That would make him more angry. I
don't think we should do anything.

61
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:17,623
We must
do something!

62
00:08:17,706 --> 00:08:20,459
Like Rafael?
Talk sense.

63
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:24,213
We break our backs
in the fields, and our bellies stay empty.

64
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:26,757
We must do something!

65
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,342
We must do something.

66
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,469
But what?

67
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,638
I don't know.

68
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:41,396
We'll ask the old man.

69
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,733
He'll know.

70
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:47,778
Fight.

71
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,531
You must fight. Fight!

72
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:54,910
With machetes
and bare hands against guns?!

73
00:08:54,993 --> 00:08:56,370
Buy guns.

74
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:57,538
Buy?

75
00:08:57,621 --> 00:09:01,583
Go to the border.
Guns are plentiful there.

76
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:04,837
But what are we
going to use for money?

77
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,475
Sell that.

78
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,270
And anything else
you can collect.

79
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,524
Even if we
had the guns,...

80
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:30,445
...we know how to plant and grow
- we don't know how to kill.

81
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:32,948
Then learn.

82
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:35,117
Or die.

83
00:10:31,423 --> 00:10:34,343
Hey! I've been
waitin' for you.

84
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:38,305
Oh, you did
a wonderful job.

85
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:40,682
I'm sorry, but
there'll be no funeral.

86
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:41,808
What?!

87
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:46,313
The grave's dug, and the defunct is as
ready as the embalmer can make him,...

88
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:48,190
...but there'll
be no funeral.

89
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:49,942
Didn't I pay you enough?

90
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:54,821
It's not a question of money. For $20, I'd
plant anybody with a whoop and a holler.

91
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,866
But the funeral's off.

92
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:00,035
Well, how d'ya
like that?!

93
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:04,623
I want him buried. You want him buried. If
he could talk, he'd second the motion.

94
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:06,625
That's as unanimous
as you can get.

95
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,419
You've behaved
like a Christian, but...

96
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:12,130
Now, look. I'm not
lookin' for any praise.

97
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:14,633
I'm a traveling salesman
- ladies' corsets.

98
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:17,386
I'm walking
down the street and a man drops dead.

99
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:21,139
For two hours people stepped over
him, without lifting a finger.

100
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:23,392
I'm doing what
any decent man would.

101
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:24,560
Come on, Henry...

102
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:26,311
No! This man
has to be buried.

103
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:28,522
Soon. He's not
turning into a nosegay.

104
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,649
I know. I would
if I could, but...

105
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:33,068
...there's an element
in town that objects.

106
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,362
Objects? To what?

107
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:38,073
They say he isn't
fit to be buried there.

108
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:39,741
What? In Boot Hill?

109
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:43,453
There's nothing there
but murderers, cutthroats and barflies.

110
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:46,498
And if they ever
felt exclusive, they're past it now.

111
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:49,293
They happen to be
white, friend.

112
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,461
And old Sam...

113
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:55,132
Well, old Sam
was an Indian.

114
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:58,427
Well, I'll be damned!

115
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:02,389
I never knew you had to be anything but a
corpse to get into Boot Hill.

116
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,558
How long's this
been going on?

117
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,643
Since the town
got civilized.

118
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:09,354
It's not my doin', boys.
I don't like it. No, sir.

119
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:12,816
I've always treated
every man as another future customer.

120
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,568
In that case,
get that hearse rollin'.

121
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,361
My driver's quit.

122
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:17,779
He's prejudiced too, huh?

123
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:20,616
If it comes to gettin'
his head blown off.

124
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:21,742
Well, get somebody else.

125
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:24,411
Nobody else
will drive it! So here.

126
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:28,790
Oh, hell! If that's all that's holding things
up, I'll drive the rig.

127
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,302
Can I borrow
that scatter-gun?

128
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:42,721
You're more
than welcome.

129
00:12:48,143 --> 00:12:52,564
Hey! Wait a minute there.
This hearse cost me $840.

130
00:12:52,648 --> 00:12:53,732
It's the only one
in the county.

131
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:56,276
I'll be darned if
I let it be shot at.

132
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,819
I'll pay for
the damages.

133
00:12:57,903 --> 00:12:58,904
I wanna see this.

134
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:00,322
Me, too!

135
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:06,787
Never rode shotgun
on a hearse before.

136
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,176
Let her buck.

137
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:55,419
New in town?

138
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:56,628
Yeah.

139
00:13:56,712 --> 00:13:57,838
Where are you from?

140
00:13:57,921 --> 00:14:00,048
Dodge. You?

141
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:03,719
Tombstone. See any
action up there?

142
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:04,970
Uh-uh.

143
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,680
Tombstone?

144
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,099
Same. People all
settled down, like.

145
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:10,350
Same all over.

146
00:14:10,434 --> 00:14:11,685
Injun lovers!

147
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:14,479
Easy. Just wind.

148
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:16,481
We'll get there.

149
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:19,109
It's not gettin' up there
that bothers me.

150
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:21,695
It's stayin' up there
that I mind.

151
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:29,536
Comin' up behind
us on the left.

152
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:34,249
I don't think so.

153
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:43,717
Second-story window.
Curtain moved.

154
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,179
I'm not in a good position.
Let him stick his neck out.

155
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,392
You elected?

156
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:54,353
No.

157
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:56,939
I got nominated
real good.

158
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:04,071
Boys, why don't you just turn around now -
save yourselves a lot of trouble?

159
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:05,864
Soon, huh?

160
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:12,579
The reception
committee is forming.

161
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:33,892
Hold it.

162
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:36,311
Hold it right there.

163
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:41,149
Anything wrong?

164
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:50,117
Turn that rig around
and get it down the hill.

165
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:08,218
I need six men up here.

166
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:37,581
Yahoo!

167
00:16:41,251 --> 00:16:43,212
Boys, the drinks
are on me!

168
00:17:18,622 --> 00:17:20,916
Hey! Hey!

169
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:24,169
I'd like to buy
you a drink. And your friend, too.

170
00:17:27,256 --> 00:17:29,258
Thanks.

171
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:30,968
Where are you from?

172
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:35,138
Oh, yeah. Where
are you goin'?

173
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,976
Thanks for
the free show.

174
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,644
You're more
than welcome.

175
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:45,274
Boy, that was really something. I won't
forget that if I live to be a hundred.

176
00:17:45,357 --> 00:17:47,067
Henry, the stage
is leavin'!

177
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,318
All right, all right!

178
00:17:48,402 --> 00:17:52,823
Wait till Flora hears about this. Y'know,
she won't believe one word of it.

179
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:55,284
Henry!
The stage! Come on!

180
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:59,663
You keep this.

181
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:27,900
Where are you headed?

182
00:18:27,983 --> 00:18:30,402
I'm drifting south,
more or less.

183
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:32,487
You?

184
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:34,489
Just driftin'.

185
00:18:34,573 --> 00:18:35,741
Any action here?

186
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:37,242
Yeah. Grocery
clerk and bouncer

187
00:18:37,326 --> 00:18:40,579
in one of those bars
across the street, if that's your taste.

188
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:42,623
Ah.

189
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:43,749
Yeah.

190
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:45,918
Well... see ya.

191
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:50,881
Say, uh...
what's your name?

192
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:54,510
Make it Vin.

193
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:55,928
What's yours?

194
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:57,387
Chris.

195
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:29,545
Yes?

196
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:40,973
We think you are
a man we can trust.

197
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:44,017
Thank you very much.

198
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:45,102
We wish you
to help us.

199
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:46,979
There's this man,
Calvera.

200
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:48,564
A thief.
A murderer.

201
00:19:48,647 --> 00:19:52,484
He and his men, they steal our food, and
then they leave us to starve.

202
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:54,319
Not only that,
but our women...

203
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:56,029
Wait, wait.
Just a minute.

204
00:19:56,113 --> 00:19:58,532
If you need protection,
go to the rurales.

205
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:00,200
We did. Twice.

206
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:05,414
But they can't station men in a small
village for... who knows how long?

207
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:06,707
So they left.

208
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:10,961
And when they left, he came again -
Calvera - and every year since.

209
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:13,964
He will do so
until he is stopped.

210
00:20:15,507 --> 00:20:16,967
Sit down.

211
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,808
We need help.

212
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:26,852
We must buy guns.

213
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:30,147
We know nothing
about them.

214
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:32,608
Will you buy
guns for us?

215
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:35,819
Guns are very expensive
and hard to get.

216
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,322
Why don't you
hire men?

217
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:39,531
Men?

218
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:43,285
Gunmen.
Nowadays men are cheaper than guns.

219
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:44,453
Will you go?

220
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:47,289
It will be a blessing
if you help us.

221
00:20:47,915 --> 00:20:50,000
Sorry, I'm not in
the blessing business.

222
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,877
No, no. We offer
more than that.

223
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,378
We could feed
you every day.

224
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:54,963
And we have this.

225
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:57,132
What's that?

226
00:20:57,216 --> 00:21:00,344
We can sell
this for gold.

227
00:21:00,427 --> 00:21:02,513
Everything we own.

228
00:21:02,596 --> 00:21:04,848
Everything of value
in the village.

229
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:11,647
I've been offered
a lot for my work, but never everything.

230
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,857
Will it be enough?

231
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:17,903
You see,
if we could drive the bandits away,...

232
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:20,822
...life could be very
good in our village.

233
00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:25,786
But as it is, we ourselves
could stand it a little longer,...

234
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:29,289
...but the children,
they cry because they're hungry.

235
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:33,961
Do you understand what it means when
you start something like this?

236
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:36,338
We will fight, too.
Every one of us.

237
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:39,466
When Calvera comes,
the church bell will ring the alarm.

238
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:42,177
We'll fight with guns,
if we have them.

239
00:21:42,261 --> 00:21:46,098
If we don't, with machetes,
axes, clubs, anything!

240
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:52,771
Once you begin,...

241
00:21:52,855 --> 00:21:55,983
...you have to be prepared
for killing and more killing.

242
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:58,902
And still more killing -
until the reason for it has gone.

243
00:21:58,986 --> 00:22:00,112
We understand.

244
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:02,030
We've considered that.

245
00:22:02,114 --> 00:22:04,992
Does every man
in the village feel the same?

246
00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:07,161
Every man.

247
00:22:09,246 --> 00:22:10,873
I'll see what
I can do for you.

248
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:12,166
Gracias. You know...

249
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:14,710
Now, wait.
I didn't say I'll go.

250
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:18,338
I'll pass the word
around that you're looking for men.

251
00:22:18,422 --> 00:22:23,468
It won't be hard
to find men here. Everyone wears a gun.

252
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:27,055
Sure - same as
they wear pants. That's expected.

253
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:30,559
But good men?
That's something else again.

254
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:33,145
How can you tell
they are good?

255
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:37,024
There are ways.

256
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:48,285
Come in.

257
00:22:52,206 --> 00:22:54,583
The word is out
you're looking for men.

258
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:57,419
That's right.
Men who are good with that.

259
00:22:57,503 --> 00:22:59,087
I'm good with it.

260
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:00,631
Fast?

261
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:02,549
Try me.

262
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:04,676
I aim to.
Step in closer.

263
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:09,890
Now, hold your
hands like that.

264
00:23:10,933 --> 00:23:13,018
Now, clap.

265
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:14,770
Faster.

266
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:17,147
Now, as fast
as you can.

267
00:23:26,782 --> 00:23:28,325
Now you try it.

268
00:24:02,526 --> 00:24:05,320
Very young and...
and very proud.

269
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:11,577
The graveyards are full of boys who were
very young and very proud.

270
00:24:21,879 --> 00:24:23,964
Come in.

271
00:24:43,734 --> 00:24:45,527
No tricks now, Chris.

272
00:24:45,611 --> 00:24:48,071
Harry! It's good
to see you again.

273
00:24:48,155 --> 00:24:49,156
Chris.

274
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:50,616
What are you doing
in this dump?

275
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:52,493
I heard you've got
a contract open.

276
00:24:52,576 --> 00:24:54,244
Not for a high-stepper
like you.

277
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:57,498
A dollar bill always
looks as big to me as a bedspread.

278
00:24:57,581 --> 00:24:59,166
It's just eating money.

279
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:03,670
A gold eagle, room and board.
Six weeks gunning for some farmers.

280
00:25:03,754 --> 00:25:08,217
You old Cajun! You don't talk so good, but
you always know what's goin' on.

281
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,385
Oh, Harry.

282
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:14,640
With your permission.

283
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:19,686
All right.
All that's on top. What's underneath?

284
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,063
Only what I told you.

285
00:25:21,146 --> 00:25:23,732
Gold? Cattle? Payroll?

286
00:25:23,815 --> 00:25:25,484
Only what I told you.

287
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:27,986
Sure, never mind.
Tell me when you can.

288
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:31,031
Harry, please don't
understand me so fast!

289
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:33,867
I said never mind.
I'm in.

290
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:35,661
You dirty dog!

291
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:57,808
Place your bets.

292
00:26:05,357 --> 00:26:12,197
Five.

293
00:26:16,994 --> 00:26:18,620
Eight.

294
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,419
Eights again.
Ten at the point.

295
00:26:29,882 --> 00:26:33,135
The cowpoke that
just walked in in the stovepipe chaps,...

296
00:26:33,218 --> 00:26:34,553
...I'd like to buy
him a drink.

297
00:26:34,636 --> 00:26:36,555
Yes, sir!

298
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:40,559
VГЎlgame Dios.
There's one. Look at the scars on his face.

299
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:43,854
The man for us
is the one who gave him that face.

300
00:26:43,937 --> 00:26:46,398
Hey... you learn fast.

301
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:50,068
Next bet comin' up.

302
00:26:59,495 --> 00:27:01,079
Crap.

303
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,295
Next man.

304
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:14,510
Gent over there
wants to buy you a drink.

305
00:27:22,226 --> 00:27:23,310
Vin.

306
00:27:23,393 --> 00:27:24,436
Howdy.

307
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,647
I'd like to buy
you a drink.

308
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,315
Whiskey.

309
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:30,776
Have you anything
lined up?

310
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:34,696
Yeah. I'm gonna
take a job in a grocery store.

311
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:38,617
Fella says
I'm gonna make a crackerjack clerk.

312
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,577
Crackerjack.

313
00:27:40,661 --> 00:27:42,955
If that's your taste...

314
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:48,669
I heard of a job shooin' some flies away
from a village, but I don't know the pay.

315
00:27:48,752 --> 00:27:50,754
$20.

316
00:27:50,838 --> 00:27:51,839
A week?

317
00:27:51,922 --> 00:27:53,715
Six weeks:
the whole job.

318
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:56,051
Well, that's ridiculous.

319
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:00,472
You heard of anything?

320
00:28:00,556 --> 00:28:01,849
Yeah.

321
00:28:01,932 --> 00:28:05,310
Shooing some flies away
from a little village.

322
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:07,312
Their village.

323
00:28:09,356 --> 00:28:11,441
It pays $20?

324
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:14,903
I'm looking for
men right now.

325
00:28:16,405 --> 00:28:18,407
No, it wouldn't even
pay for my bullets.

326
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:20,242
Ours is a poor village.

327
00:28:20,325 --> 00:28:23,579
We understand. You could get much
more in a grocery store,...

328
00:28:23,662 --> 00:28:25,747
...and it's good,
steady work.

329
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:27,916
Yep.

330
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:31,753
How many you got?

331
00:29:00,741 --> 00:29:02,701
Looking for O'Reilly.

332
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:04,286
Don't know his name,

333
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:07,331
but there's a fella
in back choppin' wood for his breakfast.

334
00:29:24,306 --> 00:29:25,557
Mornin'.

335
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:31,021
I'm a friend
of Harry Luck's.

336
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:33,190
He tells me
you're broke.

337
00:29:33,273 --> 00:29:36,902
Nah, I'm doing this
because I'm an eccentric millionaire!

338
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:41,031
There's a job for six men, watching over a
village, south of the border.

339
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:45,410
How big's the opposition?

340
00:29:45,494 --> 00:29:47,788
Thirty guns.

341
00:29:51,083 --> 00:29:54,711
I admire your notion
of fair odds, mister.

342
00:29:54,795 --> 00:29:58,257
Harry tells me you faced bigger
odds in the Travis County war.

343
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:02,094
Well, they paid me
$600 for that one.

344
00:30:02,177 --> 00:30:04,847
He said you got
that Salinas thing cleared up.

345
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:07,724
They paid me $800
for that one.

346
00:30:07,808 --> 00:30:09,017
You cost a lot.

347
00:30:09,101 --> 00:30:11,395
Yeah...

348
00:30:11,478 --> 00:30:14,064
That's right,
I cost a lot.

349
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:16,900
The offer is $20.

350
00:30:31,915 --> 00:30:34,001
$20?

351
00:30:38,547 --> 00:30:41,175
Right now,
that's a lot.

352
00:30:41,258 --> 00:30:42,509
Where can
I reach you?

353
00:30:42,593 --> 00:30:43,844
Right here.

354
00:30:50,642 --> 00:30:52,144
I still say he can't.

355
00:30:52,227 --> 00:30:53,353
And I tell you he can.

356
00:30:53,437 --> 00:30:55,355
If he claims that,
he's a liar.

357
00:30:55,439 --> 00:30:56,940
Not so loud.
He might hear you.

358
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:59,818
I don't give a damn
if he hears me or not.

359
00:30:59,902 --> 00:31:02,946
I got two months'
salary comin'. I'll bet it all it ain't so.

360
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,490
Well, you ain't
bettin' with me.

361
00:31:04,573 --> 00:31:05,616
Me either.

362
00:31:05,699 --> 00:31:07,826
I told you what he said,
and I believe him.

363
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,411
Well, one of us
is a fathead.

364
00:31:09,495 --> 00:31:11,079
You can get good
odds on which.

365
00:31:11,163 --> 00:31:13,707
Ha! Ha! Ha!

366
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:23,383
Britt. Britt,
wake up.

367
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:27,638
I'm talkin' to ya!
Look at me!

368
00:31:31,266 --> 00:31:36,063
Filene told me what you said.
I say you're wrong. What d'you say?

369
00:31:39,149 --> 00:31:41,235
Ha! Ha! Ha!

370
00:31:43,445 --> 00:31:47,115
What's the matter?
You afraid? Afraid to tell me I'm wrong?!

371
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:27,990
Call it.

372
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:41,712
Well, you see, I won.

373
00:32:41,795 --> 00:32:44,006
Well, how about it?

374
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:48,844
Well?

375
00:32:52,723 --> 00:32:53,891
Filene, how about it?

376
00:32:53,974 --> 00:32:55,851
I don't know.
It was mighty close.

377
00:32:55,934 --> 00:33:00,898
Close? What d'you mean, close? You all
got eyes. You saw what happened. I won!

378
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,406
You tell 'em.
I won, didn't I?

379
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,116
You lost.

380
00:33:28,926 --> 00:33:30,802
You're a liar.

381
00:33:33,764 --> 00:33:36,141
I said you're a liar!

382
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:40,020
I said you're
a coward and a liar!

383
00:33:43,857 --> 00:33:46,902
Get up. Let's
do it for real.

384
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,655
Get up!

385
00:33:49,738 --> 00:33:52,366
Get up, I said!

386
00:33:52,449 --> 00:33:55,452
So help me,
I'll let you have it right where you are.

387
00:34:08,549 --> 00:34:09,550
Call it!

388
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:10,634
I want nothin'
to do with this.

389
00:34:10,717 --> 00:34:11,718
Call it!

390
00:34:11,802 --> 00:34:12,803
Drop it, Wallace.
Forget it.

391
00:34:12,886 --> 00:34:14,888
Get away from me.

392
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:30,362
Call it.

393
00:35:07,941 --> 00:35:09,318
Britt.

394
00:35:10,235 --> 00:35:11,361
Chris.

395
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:14,323
Can I have a word
with you?

396
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:27,002
Did you have any luck?

397
00:35:27,085 --> 00:35:30,297
Found a man
who would have been perfect.

398
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:35,093
Gun or knife, you couldn't want any
better. Wasn't interested.

399
00:35:35,177 --> 00:35:37,429
The money?
It wasn't enough?

400
00:35:37,804 --> 00:35:40,098
He doesn't care
a hoot about money.

401
00:35:40,182 --> 00:35:43,644
A man in this line
of work who doesn't care about money?!

402
00:35:43,727 --> 00:35:48,649
Men in this line of work are not all alike.
Some care about nothing but money.

403
00:35:48,732 --> 00:35:52,194
Others, for reasons
of their own, enjoy only the danger.

404
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:54,196
And the competition.

405
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:59,117
If he's the best with a knife and a gun,
with whom does he compete?

406
00:35:59,201 --> 00:36:00,869
Himself.

407
00:36:05,249 --> 00:36:06,625
You.

408
00:36:11,755 --> 00:36:13,215
I've been looking
for you!

409
00:36:13,298 --> 00:36:15,259
Uh-oh! What have
we got here?

410
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:17,177
Never mind.

411
00:36:17,261 --> 00:36:19,346
He knows.

412
00:36:20,138 --> 00:36:23,308
Clap hands, he says.

413
00:36:23,392 --> 00:36:27,104
Clap your hands,
and let's see how fast you are.

414
00:36:27,771 --> 00:36:29,398
Clap hands!

415
00:36:30,858 --> 00:36:33,986
A man comes to him...
cos he respects him,...

416
00:36:35,737 --> 00:36:38,282
...cos he'd be proud
to work with him.

417
00:36:40,117 --> 00:36:44,121
He makes me look like two cents
with some damned kids' game!

418
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:45,497
Hey, kid, that's
enough of that!

419
00:36:45,581 --> 00:36:48,625
You stay away
from me, will ya?

420
00:36:55,757 --> 00:36:58,135
Come on, now,...

421
00:36:58,218 --> 00:37:00,762
...and let's see
how fast you are.

422
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:07,019
And no games, huh?
No clapping hands - none of that stuff!

423
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:09,771
Just draw.

424
00:37:09,855 --> 00:37:12,441
Come on.
Come on, draw!

425
00:37:13,567 --> 00:37:17,029
- Campesino. Come on!
- You say campesino to me?!

426
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:21,116
You get out of my way,
you dirt farmer!

427
00:37:33,795 --> 00:37:36,507
You don't think
I mean it, huh?

428
00:37:39,259 --> 00:37:41,762
You... think
I'm just talking, huh?

429
00:37:58,237 --> 00:38:00,531
Hey... get up.

430
00:38:02,366 --> 00:38:03,909
Do you hear me?

431
00:38:07,204 --> 00:38:09,540
Get up and face me!

432
00:38:10,582 --> 00:38:12,292
Do you hear?!

433
00:38:53,125 --> 00:38:54,751
Hey,...

434
00:38:58,255 --> 00:39:00,591
...give him my gun, huh?

435
00:39:14,563 --> 00:39:17,316
Sorry this happened, friend.

436
00:39:17,399 --> 00:39:19,860
Let him sleep it off.

437
00:39:19,943 --> 00:39:23,864
When he wakes up,
let him have his gun back.

438
00:39:23,947 --> 00:39:25,866
And give him a drink.

439
00:39:28,243 --> 00:39:30,120
I changed my mind.

440
00:39:38,837 --> 00:39:42,633
There's a man waiting in your room.
Said he was a friend of yours.

441
00:40:02,486 --> 00:40:04,238
Remember me?

442
00:40:10,994 --> 00:40:13,163
Yep.

443
00:40:13,247 --> 00:40:15,249
You need men to
do a job in Mexico.

444
00:40:15,332 --> 00:40:16,542
That's right.

445
00:40:16,625 --> 00:40:17,668
How long?

446
00:40:17,751 --> 00:40:19,461
Four, six weeks.

447
00:40:19,545 --> 00:40:23,298
That ought to do it.
How much does the job pay?

448
00:40:24,883 --> 00:40:28,387
I thought you were
looking for the Johnson brothers.

449
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:30,848
I found them.

450
00:40:30,931 --> 00:40:32,641
How much
does the job pay?

451
00:40:32,724 --> 00:40:34,768
20. We leave
tomorrow.

452
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:38,522
I'll have the money
before I leave.

453
00:40:38,605 --> 00:40:41,692
It'll just take care of
my last two days' rent.

454
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:45,445
$20? You must
be livin' in style.

455
00:40:45,529 --> 00:40:47,072
Yes.

456
00:40:47,156 --> 00:40:52,035
I have the most stylish
corner of the filthy storeroom out back.

457
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:54,371
That, and one
plate of beans:

458
00:40:55,205 --> 00:40:56,915
$10 a day.

459
00:40:57,124 --> 00:41:00,377
Yeah, things do get high
when they find out you're on the run.

460
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:03,172
There's a dry wash
south of town.

461
00:41:05,048 --> 00:41:06,592
Pick me up there.

462
00:41:14,266 --> 00:41:16,393
He's a good gun.

463
00:41:17,686 --> 00:41:20,439
And we aren't heading
for a church social.

464
00:41:41,585 --> 00:41:43,003
Chris.

465
00:41:44,713 --> 00:41:47,633
Yeah. He picked
us up at dawn.

466
00:41:49,468 --> 00:41:50,761
Any idea who it is?

467
00:41:50,844 --> 00:41:53,096
Yeah. That kid
from the saloon.

468
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,057
Won't take no
for an answer.

469
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,017
Doesn't show much
sense, does he?

470
00:42:15,452 --> 00:42:18,622
I'm getting a stiff neck
keepin' track of him.

471
00:42:18,705 --> 00:42:21,875
If you can't forget him,
why don't you ride side-saddle?

472
00:42:21,959 --> 00:42:24,837
Ah, well... he won't
last much longer.

473
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,421
That so?

474
00:42:28,131 --> 00:42:32,177
Ridin' out there in all
that dust and heat - what a chucklehead!

475
00:42:32,261 --> 00:42:34,596
Yeah. Not
smart like us!

476
00:42:36,306 --> 00:42:37,599
Yep.

477
00:42:45,357 --> 00:42:48,485
Suppose our friend
over there has got anything to eat?

478
00:42:48,569 --> 00:42:50,529
How about
I bring him some?

479
00:42:50,612 --> 00:42:52,281
Ah, it isn't food
he's hungry for.

480
00:42:52,364 --> 00:42:56,702
Then let me tie a can to his tail. Right
now, he's like an itch I can't scratch.

481
00:42:56,785 --> 00:43:00,038
Ah, leave him alone.
It's a free country.

482
00:43:00,122 --> 00:43:01,999
And it's his.

483
00:43:34,323 --> 00:43:37,993
You know, it's funny.
Now that he's gone, I kinda miss him.

484
00:45:23,223 --> 00:45:25,100
Where is everybody?

485
00:45:26,685 --> 00:45:28,145
Where are they, Tomas?

486
00:45:28,228 --> 00:45:30,814
Luis! AsunciГіn! Demetrio!

487
00:45:31,023 --> 00:45:34,526
Emilio! Sotero!
What kind of a reception is this?

488
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:39,531
Come out! Come out and make them
welcome, before we die of shame.

489
00:45:39,615 --> 00:45:42,075
Hilario, stop your shouting.

490
00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:53,795
Do they call this a welcome?
What are they thinking of?!

491
00:45:53,879 --> 00:45:56,298
Come in.
You must be thirsty.

492
00:45:57,925 --> 00:46:01,094
You must excuse them.
They are farmers here.

493
00:46:01,178 --> 00:46:03,680
They are afraid
of everyone and everything.

494
00:46:03,764 --> 00:46:06,433
They are afraid
of rain, and no rain...

495
00:46:06,558 --> 00:46:10,562
The summer
may be too hot, the winter - too cold.

496
00:46:10,646 --> 00:46:14,316
The sow has no pigs,
the farmer is afraid he may starve.

497
00:46:14,399 --> 00:46:17,528
She has too many,
he's afraid she may starve.

498
00:46:18,529 --> 00:46:23,116
There's no need to apologize. We
didn't expect flowers and speeches.

499
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:27,120
Tomorrow is the anniversary
of the founding of the village.

500
00:46:27,204 --> 00:46:31,375
They will be celebrating -
then, you will see them in a better light.

501
00:46:48,851 --> 00:46:50,894
Who sounded the alarm?

502
00:46:54,773 --> 00:46:56,441
Who sounded the alarm?!

503
00:47:00,779 --> 00:47:01,989
I did.

504
00:47:16,295 --> 00:47:19,923
Thank you, amigos,
for coming out to greet us.

505
00:47:20,007 --> 00:47:22,759
Thank you for
letting us see your beautiful faces!

506
00:47:22,843 --> 00:47:25,846
Thank you,
thank you, you chickens!

507
00:47:26,513 --> 00:47:29,224
You come running
out like chickens!

508
00:47:30,058 --> 00:47:33,687
We ride to this
middle of nowhere.

509
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:35,397
We're ready to risk
our lives to help you.

510
00:47:35,689 --> 00:47:37,399
And you?

511
00:47:37,483 --> 00:47:39,735
You hide from us!

512
00:47:43,113 --> 00:47:44,907
Hide... from us!

513
00:47:50,204 --> 00:47:54,041
Ah... but it's a different
story when you're in danger, huh?

514
00:47:55,292 --> 00:47:57,920
You might lose
your precious crops.

515
00:47:58,003 --> 00:48:00,589
Then you flock to us. Huh?

516
00:48:04,218 --> 00:48:07,804
Well... we're here,
my compadres and I.

517
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:10,307
And here we stay.

518
00:48:12,309 --> 00:48:14,269
And you?

519
00:48:14,353 --> 00:48:18,774
You prove to us
that you're worth fighting for.

520
00:48:18,857 --> 00:48:22,778
Now get back to your houses,
back to work. Go on! Go back.

521
00:48:22,861 --> 00:48:27,574
We'll let you know when to fight and how
to fight. Go back! All of you, go back!

522
00:48:27,658 --> 00:48:29,618
Go back!

523
00:48:42,089 --> 00:48:43,632
Now we're seven.

524
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:17,916
You know, I've been in some towns where
the girls aren't very pretty.

525
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,212
As a matter of fact, I've been in some
towns where they were downright ugly.

526
00:49:22,296 --> 00:49:25,883
But this is the first time I've been in a
town where there's no girls at all.

527
00:49:25,966 --> 00:49:28,093
Except little ones.

528
00:49:28,177 --> 00:49:31,930
If we're not careful,
we can have quite a social life here!

529
00:49:32,014 --> 00:49:36,602
Oh, it's not so bad. I fell in with a fast
crowd that hangs out near the fountain.

530
00:49:36,685 --> 00:49:40,606
We got to predictin' the weather for today
and didn't break up till twilight.

531
00:49:49,364 --> 00:49:52,951
Stop the music!
Bring out the other bull!

532
00:51:11,363 --> 00:51:12,406
Hilario!

533
00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:07,419
Britt.

534
00:52:08,962 --> 00:52:13,717
The boy saw three of Calvera's
men. The horses are in the arroyo.

535
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,928
Lee.

536
00:52:16,011 --> 00:52:17,846
Get one alive.

537
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:19,139
Yes.

538
00:52:20,390 --> 00:52:22,643
I'll show you where.

539
00:52:23,435 --> 00:52:26,563
Rico, he knows
where the arroyo is.

540
00:55:39,882 --> 00:55:41,508
I'm sorry, Britt.
I didn't mean to spoil it.

541
00:55:41,592 --> 00:55:42,676
Shut up!

542
00:55:52,853 --> 00:55:57,774
Oh... That... that
was the greatest shot I've ever seen.

543
00:55:57,858 --> 00:55:59,776
The worst.

544
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:01,612
I was aiming
at the horse.

545
00:56:24,009 --> 00:56:27,262
Three men were sent
by Calvera to spy.

546
00:56:27,346 --> 00:56:30,182
It's almost certain
they saw us.

547
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:39,274
Whatever they learned
will be buried with them.

548
00:56:39,358 --> 00:56:41,610
VГЎlgame Dios!
If he comes now...

549
00:56:42,152 --> 00:56:46,615
He'd never send men ahead
if he was near enough to see for himself.

550
00:56:46,698 --> 00:56:51,578
So we have time to get ready. And we
have something else - surprise.

551
00:56:52,204 --> 00:56:56,708
If he rides in with no idea of the
reception we can prepare for him,...

552
00:56:56,792 --> 00:57:00,128
...I promise you, we'll all teach him
something about the price of corn.

553
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:03,674
Aim,...

554
00:57:03,757 --> 00:57:06,051
...squeeze,...

555
00:57:06,134 --> 00:57:08,929
...cock.

556
00:57:09,012 --> 00:57:10,848
Aim,...

557
00:57:10,973 --> 00:57:13,058
...squeeze,...

558
00:57:13,934 --> 00:57:15,227
...cock.

559
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:21,525
Settle down. Now, you miss the first
chance, you may not get a second.

560
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:27,072
Get that butt tight in your shoulder. If you
don't, two things will happen.

561
00:57:27,156 --> 00:57:30,742
One: you'll waste a bullet.
Two: you'll break your arm.

562
00:57:31,076 --> 00:57:36,582
Now, close your eye.
Aim from here, to here, to the target.

563
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:39,459
Fire.

564
00:57:39,543 --> 00:57:41,336
That rock?

565
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:43,755
No, that man
you're gonna kill.

566
00:57:47,801 --> 00:57:49,386
Good!

567
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:52,097
If only we had more guns,
think what we could do!

568
00:57:52,181 --> 00:57:53,807
You'll get more guns.

569
00:57:53,891 --> 00:57:54,850
How?

570
00:57:54,933 --> 00:57:58,020
The same way
you got these. Calvera's men.

571
00:57:58,103 --> 00:58:00,856
The ones who spied
on us brought them.

572
00:58:00,939 --> 00:58:03,358
Like three kings
bearing gifts.

573
00:58:12,201 --> 00:58:15,662
If Calvera
does not come now, after all of this,...

574
00:58:15,746 --> 00:58:17,414
...what a waste!

575
00:58:24,129 --> 00:58:26,840
A pretty foxy fellow,
this Calvera, eh?

576
00:58:26,924 --> 00:58:30,010
SeГ±or, not a fox.
A coyote!

577
00:58:32,012 --> 00:58:35,015
How did he
ever find out about the gold mine?

578
00:58:35,098 --> 00:58:37,184
Gold mine?

579
00:58:38,769 --> 00:58:40,813
What gold
mine, seГ±or?

580
00:58:40,896 --> 00:58:43,524
You know, the one
in the mountains.

581
00:58:43,774 --> 00:58:45,609
In our mountains?

582
00:58:45,692 --> 00:58:48,237
We never had a gold
mine around here.

583
00:58:49,279 --> 00:58:53,075
Say, come to think of it,
it was a silver mine.

584
00:58:53,158 --> 00:58:54,701
Whatever happened to it?

585
00:58:54,785 --> 00:58:57,079
We have no
silver mine either.

586
00:58:57,162 --> 00:58:58,705
I mean in the old days.

587
00:58:58,789 --> 00:59:01,166
Not at any time.

588
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:04,837
Where did you hear
of this gold and silver, hm?

589
00:59:06,213 --> 00:59:09,800
All right, come on, boys.
More work, less talk, huh?

590
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:59,975
Toro.

591
01:00:00,142 --> 01:00:02,352
Toro!

592
01:00:02,728 --> 01:00:05,147
Come on,
little bull!

593
01:00:10,569 --> 01:00:25,083
Toro.

594
01:01:24,810 --> 01:01:28,272
You do anything to me
and I'll kill you while you are doing it.

595
01:01:28,355 --> 01:01:30,649
You almost
took my eye out!

596
01:01:30,732 --> 01:01:33,110
Let me go.
Let me go!

597
01:01:33,193 --> 01:01:36,071
Oh, you bite me
and I'll bite you!

598
01:01:36,905 --> 01:01:39,366
I got a good mind
to throw you in the water.

599
01:01:39,449 --> 01:01:42,035
Smash you with a rock!
Cut your head off!

600
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:44,413
Shut up.
Shut up!

601
01:01:47,332 --> 01:01:49,543
Where are
the others? Huh?

602
01:01:49,626 --> 01:01:51,420
I'll never tell you.

603
01:02:26,205 --> 01:02:27,998
Look what I found.

604
01:02:37,799 --> 01:02:39,426
Who is she?

605
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:41,220
From our village.

606
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:49,436
So that's
where they were. You hid them.

607
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:52,231
Sure they hid them.
But she won't tell where.

608
01:02:52,314 --> 01:02:55,818
They're afraid.
She's afraid of me, you, him... all of us.

609
01:02:55,901 --> 01:02:59,696
Farmers! Their families
told them we'd rape them.

610
01:03:01,657 --> 01:03:03,992
Well, we might.

611
01:03:04,076 --> 01:03:08,539
In my opinion, though, you might have
given us the benefit of the doubt.

612
01:03:08,622 --> 01:03:11,208
But... just
as you please.

613
01:03:12,292 --> 01:03:16,004
As long as you were
out there, why didn't you bring 'em all in?

614
01:03:16,088 --> 01:03:18,715
What for? Leave
them out there.

615
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:21,426
Let Calvera find them.
He'll take good care of them.

616
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:22,719
Bring them in.

617
01:03:22,803 --> 01:03:24,888
Show him the way.

618
01:03:24,972 --> 01:03:27,057
Ma'am.

619
01:03:32,938 --> 01:03:35,774
Come on,
little angel!

620
01:03:42,698 --> 01:03:44,783
Gently, boy.

621
01:03:45,617 --> 01:03:47,703
Gently.

622
01:04:27,201 --> 01:04:31,121
I can't tell you how wonderful it was for
you seГ±oritas to fix dinner for us.

623
01:04:44,801 --> 01:04:45,969
How's the food?

624
01:04:46,053 --> 01:04:47,846
Great.

625
01:04:48,096 --> 01:04:51,725
Chicken enchiladas,
carne asada and Spanish rice. Looks good.

626
01:04:51,809 --> 01:04:55,229
These people really know how to
cook. Dig in, there's tons of it.

627
01:04:55,312 --> 01:04:58,899
Do you know what the villagers have
been eating since we got here?

628
01:04:58,982 --> 01:05:01,360
Tortillas
and a few beans, that's all.

629
01:05:05,322 --> 01:05:06,323
Thank you.

630
01:05:06,406 --> 01:05:07,783
You're welcome.

631
01:05:07,991 --> 01:05:09,034
Thank you.

632
01:05:09,117 --> 01:05:10,661
You're welcome.

633
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:12,913
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

634
01:05:12,996 --> 01:05:15,082
Do you have
an older, grateful sister at home?

635
01:05:15,165 --> 01:05:17,251
No, sir.
Many thanks.

636
01:05:17,334 --> 01:05:18,919
You're welcome.

637
01:05:19,002 --> 01:05:20,462
Many thanks.

638
01:05:20,754 --> 01:05:36,436
One, two,
three, four.

639
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:37,938
One, two,...

640
01:05:38,021 --> 01:05:39,439
...three, four.

641
01:05:39,523 --> 01:05:42,442
One, two, three, four.

642
01:05:42,818 --> 01:05:44,862
Squeeze.

643
01:05:45,612 --> 01:05:49,032
Miguel, didn't I tell
you to squeeze? Hm?

644
01:05:49,116 --> 01:05:51,618
Just like when
you're milking a goat, Miguel.

645
01:05:51,702 --> 01:05:53,036
It's that I get excited.

646
01:05:53,120 --> 01:05:55,164
Well,
don't get excited!

647
01:05:55,831 --> 01:05:59,793
Now, this time, squeeze.
Slowly, but squeeze.

648
01:05:59,877 --> 01:06:02,212
All right... squeeze.

649
01:06:06,383 --> 01:06:08,135
Squeeze!

650
01:06:08,218 --> 01:06:11,889
I'll tell you what.
Don't shoot the gun.

651
01:06:12,014 --> 01:06:15,809
You take the gun like this and you use
it like a club. All right?

652
01:06:15,893 --> 01:06:16,977
Right.

653
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:18,437
Flaco!

654
01:06:19,688 --> 01:06:21,732
Muchas gracias.

655
01:06:50,427 --> 01:06:51,845
Good afternoon.

656
01:06:51,929 --> 01:06:53,263
Howdy.

657
01:06:53,388 --> 01:06:56,099
We've come
to move you into the village.

658
01:06:56,225 --> 01:06:58,644
Move into
the village?! Me?!

659
01:06:58,727 --> 01:07:00,270
Everybody who
lives outside.

660
01:07:00,437 --> 01:07:02,272
Oh, no.

661
01:07:02,397 --> 01:07:04,441
We can't protect
you out here.

662
01:07:04,566 --> 01:07:07,277
Rojas is makin' room
for you in his home.

663
01:07:07,402 --> 01:07:11,532
Rojas?! His conversation
would bore me to death!

664
01:07:13,116 --> 01:07:15,202
Yeah, well, uh...

665
01:07:16,453 --> 01:07:17,538
...maybe somebody
else, huh?

666
01:07:17,621 --> 01:07:19,081
They are all farmers.

667
01:07:19,414 --> 01:07:23,293
Farmers talk of nothing
but fertilizer and women.

668
01:07:23,418 --> 01:07:27,381
I've never shared
their enthusiasm for fertilizer.

669
01:07:27,464 --> 01:07:32,427
As for women...
I became indifferent when I was 83.

670
01:07:33,303 --> 01:07:35,556
I am staying here.

671
01:07:38,809 --> 01:07:42,146
Yeah, well, uh... what are you gonna
do when Calvera comes?

672
01:07:42,271 --> 01:07:45,274
At my age, a little
excitement is welcome.

673
01:07:46,066 --> 01:07:48,443
Don't worry.
Why would he kill me?

674
01:07:48,902 --> 01:07:51,655
Bullets cost money.

675
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:54,950
All right.
Have it your way.

676
01:07:55,492 --> 01:07:57,744
You worry about yourself.

677
01:07:57,828 --> 01:07:59,997
Are you ready for him?

678
01:08:00,122 --> 01:08:02,332
What if he comes now, eh?

679
01:08:02,457 --> 01:08:05,335
It's like that fella
who fell off a ten-story building.

680
01:08:05,419 --> 01:08:07,254
What about him?

681
01:08:07,337 --> 01:08:11,592
As he was falling, people on each floor
heard him say "So far, so good."

682
01:08:11,675 --> 01:08:13,969
So far, so good!

683
01:08:41,371 --> 01:08:44,208
First of all,
they'll see that ditch.

684
01:08:44,291 --> 01:08:46,543
More water
for the corn.

685
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:52,424
Awful lot of new walls.

686
01:08:52,508 --> 01:08:54,259
Civic improvements.

687
01:08:55,802 --> 01:08:57,888
Hey, Chris,...

688
01:08:58,889 --> 01:09:01,391
...what about
that net, eh?

689
01:09:01,517 --> 01:09:04,228
Well, if he's not
looking for it...

690
01:09:04,311 --> 01:09:06,647
If he rides in
unsuspecting.

691
01:09:07,481 --> 01:09:09,566
If, brother!

692
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:11,735
If!

693
01:09:13,237 --> 01:09:15,239
Yeah.

694
01:09:15,364 --> 01:09:17,407
Yeah!

695
01:11:50,853 --> 01:11:54,815
I should have guessed. When my men
didn't come back, I should have guessed.

696
01:11:56,692 --> 01:11:58,735
How many of you
did they hire?

697
01:11:58,819 --> 01:11:59,903
Enough.

698
01:12:06,034 --> 01:12:07,995
New wall!

699
01:12:08,078 --> 01:12:10,581
There are lots
of new walls. All around.

700
01:12:14,543 --> 01:12:16,753
They won't keep me out.

701
01:12:16,879 --> 01:12:18,630
They were built
to keep you in.

702
01:12:29,683 --> 01:12:32,394
Did you hear that?
We're trapped!

703
01:12:33,187 --> 01:12:36,607
All forty of us!
By these three.

704
01:12:36,690 --> 01:12:40,194
Or is it four? They couldn't
afford to hire more than that.

705
01:12:40,277 --> 01:12:42,946
We come cheaper
by the bunch.

706
01:12:43,113 --> 01:12:44,865
Five!

707
01:12:44,948 --> 01:12:47,743
Even five won't give
us too much trouble.

708
01:12:49,203 --> 01:12:52,206
There won't be
any trouble - if you ride on.

709
01:12:52,289 --> 01:12:53,790
Ride on?

710
01:12:53,874 --> 01:12:56,043
I'm going into
the hills for the winter.

711
01:12:56,126 --> 01:12:58,086
Where am I going
to get food for my men?

712
01:12:58,170 --> 01:13:00,255
Buy it or grow it.

713
01:13:00,339 --> 01:13:02,799
Or maybe
even work for it!

714
01:13:03,133 --> 01:13:05,135
Seven!

715
01:13:05,260 --> 01:13:08,555
Somehow, I don't think
you've solved my problem.

716
01:13:08,639 --> 01:13:11,308
Solving your problems
isn't our line.

717
01:13:11,391 --> 01:13:13,769
We deal in lead, friend.

718
01:13:14,978 --> 01:13:18,106
So do I. We're in the
same business, huh?

719
01:13:18,816 --> 01:13:20,526
Only as competitors.

720
01:13:20,609 --> 01:13:22,903
Why not as partners?

721
01:13:23,779 --> 01:13:26,073
Suppose I offer
you equal shares?

722
01:13:26,156 --> 01:13:27,407
In what?

723
01:13:27,491 --> 01:13:29,743
Everything.
To the last grain.

724
01:13:29,827 --> 01:13:32,830
And the people
in the village? What about them?

725
01:13:34,665 --> 01:13:36,750
I leave it to you.

726
01:13:36,834 --> 01:13:40,420
Can men of our profession
worry about things like that?

727
01:13:40,504 --> 01:13:42,339
May even be sacrilegious.

728
01:13:44,842 --> 01:13:50,013
If God didn't want them sheared, he would
not have made them sheep.

729
01:13:50,139 --> 01:13:51,890
What do you say?

730
01:13:51,974 --> 01:13:53,183
Ride on.

731
01:13:57,813 --> 01:14:00,149
You hear that, Sotero?

732
01:14:01,316 --> 01:14:03,694
You hear what he said?

733
01:14:03,819 --> 01:14:05,779
Ride on.

734
01:14:05,863 --> 01:14:07,948
To me!

735
01:14:11,201 --> 01:14:15,038
You tell him to ride on
before I become angry.

736
01:14:15,122 --> 01:14:17,291
Him, and the others!

737
01:14:19,168 --> 01:14:21,044
Because, if I leave
with empty hands,...

738
01:14:21,128 --> 01:14:25,841
...everybody in this village
will answer to me - when I come back!

739
01:14:26,133 --> 01:14:27,968
You won't come back.

740
01:14:28,051 --> 01:14:29,595
Why not?

741
01:14:29,678 --> 01:14:31,889
You won't have any guns.

742
01:14:32,514 --> 01:14:35,434
Take them off right
now and drop them.

743
01:14:39,730 --> 01:14:42,691
Generosity.
That was my first mistake!

744
01:14:43,859 --> 01:14:47,905
I leave these people a little bit extra and
they hire these men to make trouble.

745
01:14:49,323 --> 01:14:54,244
It shows you... sooner or later, you must
answer for every good deed.

746
01:17:28,816 --> 01:17:30,651
You were safe.

747
01:17:30,734 --> 01:17:35,405
I was face to face with them as they rode
toward me. Ten of them, screaming.

748
01:17:35,489 --> 01:17:37,449
The last time
you told it, it was five!

749
01:17:37,533 --> 01:17:39,243
They multiply
like rabbits!

750
01:17:39,368 --> 01:17:41,495
Ten. Ten!

751
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:48,001
Yeh-hey!

752
01:17:48,085 --> 01:17:49,837
They got a good
kick in the behind.

753
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,588
If they try it again,
they'll get another!

754
01:17:51,672 --> 01:17:53,173
We'll tear them to pieces.

755
01:17:53,257 --> 01:17:56,260
We'll bury them all.
Calvera too, huh?!

756
01:17:59,012 --> 01:18:00,931
Any sign of 'em?

757
01:18:01,014 --> 01:18:02,683
No.

758
01:18:02,766 --> 01:18:04,518
That is bad luck.

759
01:18:04,601 --> 01:18:08,063
Can you imagine?
I knew him when he was a mouse!

760
01:18:11,358 --> 01:18:14,444
I was never so frightened in my
life. My knees were like jelly.

761
01:18:14,570 --> 01:18:16,905
I would never
have guessed it.

762
01:18:16,989 --> 01:18:18,782
Well, he'll leave us
alone from now on.

763
01:18:18,866 --> 01:18:20,784
- You think so?
- Of course.

764
01:18:20,868 --> 01:18:23,787
He'll go away.
There are other villages -

765
01:18:23,912 --> 01:18:26,623
other villages
that don't sting the way we do.

766
01:18:26,707 --> 01:18:27,875
SeГ±or!

767
01:18:35,924 --> 01:18:39,136
Neighbors...
I drink to our friends.

768
01:18:40,262 --> 01:18:46,310
They armed us, fought at our sides, and
will forever live in our hearts.

769
01:18:56,653 --> 01:18:58,947
They haven't gone, then.

770
01:19:14,338 --> 01:19:16,089
See the gun
flashin'?

771
01:19:16,173 --> 01:19:17,466
No.

772
01:19:18,675 --> 01:19:20,594
I make it
two of them.

773
01:19:20,677 --> 01:19:21,804
Three.

774
01:19:26,350 --> 01:19:28,602
Fool kid's
gonna get his head blown off.

775
01:19:42,866 --> 01:19:44,868
Chico! Stay put.

776
01:19:48,205 --> 01:19:49,623
Three?

777
01:19:50,207 --> 01:19:51,375
Three.

778
01:19:56,296 --> 01:19:58,715
O'Reilly?
Do you see them?

779
01:19:58,841 --> 01:20:02,886
No... They're too
far back in the trees.

780
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:05,055
- Chris.
- Yeah?

781
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:08,392
Try and make it up
to those rocks. I'll cover you.

782
01:20:14,398 --> 01:20:16,483
Chico...
cover the back door.

783
01:20:46,263 --> 01:20:47,806
Get back!

784
01:20:49,391 --> 01:20:51,685
Get back!
Go on!

785
01:20:52,019 --> 01:20:54,521
What's the matter?
Don't you hear so good?

786
01:20:54,605 --> 01:20:56,440
Get down.
Now stay down!

787
01:21:01,445 --> 01:21:03,530
Crazy kids!
You might have been hurt.

788
01:21:03,614 --> 01:21:04,656
So might you.

789
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:07,034
It's not the same thing.

790
01:21:07,117 --> 01:21:08,452
This is my work.

791
01:21:08,535 --> 01:21:10,454
It's our work, too.

792
01:21:10,621 --> 01:21:14,208
Everyone tells us
"Hide! Get back! Stay out of sight!"

793
01:21:14,291 --> 01:21:15,626
But we're not afraid.

794
01:21:15,709 --> 01:21:18,003
He's very brave.
It's the truth.

795
01:21:18,086 --> 01:21:22,132
So is he. We all are -
every boy in the village.

796
01:21:26,595 --> 01:21:30,098
We had a meeting
and we drew straws and we got you.

797
01:21:31,892 --> 01:21:34,645
You got me?
What d'you mean, you got me?

798
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:37,231
If you get killed,
we avenge you.

799
01:21:37,314 --> 01:21:41,193
And we see to it that
there's always fresh flowers on your grave.

800
01:21:44,947 --> 01:21:47,741
That's a mighty
big comfort!

801
01:21:47,825 --> 01:21:50,828
I told you he would
appreciate that.

802
01:21:50,953 --> 01:21:54,414
Don't you kids be too disappointed if
your plans don't work out.

803
01:21:54,498 --> 01:21:57,584
We won't.
If you stay alive, we'll be just as happy.

804
01:21:57,668 --> 01:21:59,378
Maybe even happier.

805
01:22:00,254 --> 01:22:01,672
Maybe.

806
01:22:20,274 --> 01:22:21,859
Can you see them?

807
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:24,027
No.

808
01:22:33,370 --> 01:22:35,247
Do your, uh,...

809
01:22:35,956 --> 01:22:38,667
...hands sweat
before a fight?

810
01:22:42,004 --> 01:22:43,672
Every time.

811
01:22:43,755 --> 01:22:45,883
Mine are sweatin' now.

812
01:22:46,675 --> 01:22:47,968
Funny...

813
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:52,389
Hands sweat,...

814
01:22:52,556 --> 01:22:55,225
...mouth is dry.

815
01:22:55,309 --> 01:22:57,895
You'd think it would be
the other way around.

816
01:23:02,399 --> 01:23:05,986
Does my... talking
annoy you?

817
01:23:07,571 --> 01:23:08,906
Mm-mm.

818
01:23:09,573 --> 01:23:11,742
It's because I'm...

819
01:23:13,076 --> 01:23:15,329
...I'm frightened,
you know?

820
01:23:16,538 --> 01:23:20,334
Yeah. I guess you kinda wish you'd
given your crops to Calvera, huh?

821
01:23:20,417 --> 01:23:22,085
Yes...

822
01:23:23,921 --> 01:23:25,380
...and no.

823
01:23:26,924 --> 01:23:29,218
Both at the same time.

824
01:23:30,803 --> 01:23:32,846
Yes, when I think of,...

825
01:23:32,930 --> 01:23:35,015
...of what he might do.

826
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:41,939
No, when I remember
the feeling in my chest this morning...

827
01:23:42,064 --> 01:23:44,233
...as I saw him run away.

828
01:23:45,108 --> 01:23:47,194
From us.

829
01:23:48,195 --> 01:23:50,280
Man,...

830
01:23:51,281 --> 01:23:54,034
...that's a feeling
worth dying for!

831
01:23:54,576 --> 01:23:57,746
Have you ever...
felt something like that?

832
01:23:57,830 --> 01:24:00,249
Not for a long, long time.

833
01:24:02,918 --> 01:24:04,962
I, uh,...

834
01:24:05,462 --> 01:24:07,047
...envy you.

835
01:24:18,392 --> 01:24:19,560
What are you doing here?

836
01:24:19,643 --> 01:24:21,311
You shouldn't do
things like you did.

837
01:24:21,395 --> 01:24:22,396
Go back.

838
01:24:22,479 --> 01:24:24,314
You mustn't take
foolish chances.

839
01:24:24,398 --> 01:24:26,817
All right, I won't.
But go back.

840
01:24:30,112 --> 01:24:31,155
Does it hurt?

841
01:24:31,238 --> 01:24:32,322
What?

842
01:24:45,419 --> 01:24:47,171
No.

843
01:24:48,005 --> 01:24:50,841
I'm sorry I did it,
but I thought...

844
01:24:51,925 --> 01:24:53,802
You know what I thought.

845
01:24:53,886 --> 01:24:55,512
Yes, yes. I know.

846
01:24:56,013 --> 01:24:59,183
I wasn't afraid of you.
It's my father.

847
01:25:00,350 --> 01:25:02,769
He says "Stay away
from those men."

848
01:25:03,812 --> 01:25:06,273
"They are brutes.
They are cruel."

849
01:25:06,356 --> 01:25:09,359
He's right. Do you
know that? He's right.

850
01:25:10,819 --> 01:25:13,113
Well... go back
home now.

851
01:25:14,114 --> 01:25:15,866
He is wrong.

852
01:25:18,869 --> 01:25:20,954
Well... go home anyway,...

853
01:25:21,038 --> 01:25:22,956
...before he finds
out you're here.

854
01:25:24,833 --> 01:25:27,044
He already knows.

855
01:25:27,127 --> 01:25:29,963
He said he'd punish me
for being so shameless.

856
01:25:31,632 --> 01:25:33,717
But I don't care.

857
01:25:45,979 --> 01:25:48,816
They got them.
They got them all!

858
01:25:48,899 --> 01:25:49,942
Result.

859
01:25:50,025 --> 01:25:51,318
Do you think
they'll try that again?

860
01:25:51,401 --> 01:25:53,612
I doubt it.

861
01:25:53,695 --> 01:25:56,073
For all they know,
we're still out there ready to jump them.

862
01:25:56,323 --> 01:25:58,659
He didn't go.
Calvera didn't go?

863
01:25:58,742 --> 01:26:01,328
Did you think it
would be that easy?

864
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:04,248
What do we do now?

865
01:26:04,331 --> 01:26:05,833
Well, what
do you say?

866
01:26:05,916 --> 01:26:06,959
Me?

867
01:26:07,042 --> 01:26:09,169
We work for you,
you know.

868
01:26:09,753 --> 01:26:12,506
What else is there
to do but... wait?

869
01:26:13,048 --> 01:26:14,216
It's Calvera's move.

870
01:26:14,299 --> 01:26:15,425
Right.

871
01:26:15,592 --> 01:26:18,679
Now you'd better
replace the guards. They must be tired.

872
01:26:18,762 --> 01:26:20,597
- If you were Calvera,...
- Yes?

873
01:26:20,722 --> 01:26:22,266
...you'd go away,
wouldn't you?

874
01:26:22,349 --> 01:26:25,727
If you'd paid the price
we make him pay.

875
01:26:25,936 --> 01:26:27,020
Yes, I would, only...

876
01:26:27,104 --> 01:26:28,147
Only what?

877
01:26:29,606 --> 01:26:31,567
Only I'm not Calvera.

878
01:26:32,860 --> 01:26:35,863
Take the rifles
and the bandoleras and pass 'em out.

879
01:26:35,946 --> 01:26:38,031
Now, let's get out
there on duty.

880
01:26:49,418 --> 01:26:51,378
Food, woman.

881
01:26:51,461 --> 01:26:53,589
They'll be hungry.

882
01:27:19,490 --> 01:27:22,159
That was... that
was the greatest...

883
01:27:22,242 --> 01:27:24,286
New hat for you, sonny.

884
01:27:26,497 --> 01:27:27,998
Hey!

885
01:27:29,166 --> 01:27:30,626
How do I look? Huh?

886
01:27:30,709 --> 01:27:32,503
Big improvement.

887
01:27:37,341 --> 01:27:41,178
You know what? They'll make up a
song about you and this hat.

888
01:27:41,261 --> 01:27:46,600
Villages like this make up a song about
every big thing. They sing them for years.

889
01:27:46,683 --> 01:27:47,893
Do you think
it's worth it?

890
01:27:47,976 --> 01:27:49,770
Don't you?

891
01:27:49,853 --> 01:27:51,980
It's only a matter
of knowing how to shoot a gun.

892
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:53,649
Nothing big about that.

893
01:27:59,863 --> 01:28:02,533
Hey... how can
you talk like this?

894
01:28:03,492 --> 01:28:07,788
Your gun has got you
everything you have. Isn't that true?

895
01:28:07,871 --> 01:28:09,206
Mm?

896
01:28:10,332 --> 01:28:11,583
Well, isn't that true?

897
01:28:11,667 --> 01:28:13,794
Yeah, sure. Everything.

898
01:28:13,877 --> 01:28:17,214
After a while
you can call bartenders by their first name.

899
01:28:17,297 --> 01:28:18,632
Maybe 200 of 'em.

900
01:28:18,715 --> 01:28:23,053
Rented rooms you live in: 500.
Meals you eat in hash houses: 1,000.

901
01:28:23,137 --> 01:28:25,806
Home: none.
Wife: none. Kids:

902
01:28:27,057 --> 01:28:28,475
none.

903
01:28:29,518 --> 01:28:31,687
Prospects: zero.

904
01:28:33,021 --> 01:28:35,023
Suppose I left
anything out?

905
01:28:35,107 --> 01:28:36,942
Yeah.

906
01:28:37,151 --> 01:28:39,820
Places you are
tied down to: none.

907
01:28:40,571 --> 01:28:42,990
People with
a hold on you: none.

908
01:28:43,073 --> 01:28:45,826
Men you step
aside for: none.

909
01:28:46,910 --> 01:28:49,246
Insults swallowed:

910
01:28:49,329 --> 01:28:51,165
none.

911
01:28:51,248 --> 01:28:53,584
Enemies: none.

912
01:28:55,752 --> 01:28:57,421
No enemies?

913
01:29:00,424 --> 01:29:01,758
Alive.

914
01:29:01,842 --> 01:29:05,512
Well! This is the kind
of arithmetic I like!

915
01:29:05,596 --> 01:29:07,681
Yeah, so did I
at your age.

916
01:29:07,764 --> 01:29:10,684
Give these
to someone who knows how to use them.

917
01:29:10,767 --> 01:29:12,186
Yeah.

918
01:29:13,187 --> 01:29:16,064
Why don't you ask
Calvera what he has in mind for tonight?

919
01:29:16,148 --> 01:29:19,526
Yes, do that.
And I'll write a song for you myself.

920
01:29:26,408 --> 01:29:29,286
AndrГ©s,
Lorenzo and Felipe never came back.

921
01:29:29,369 --> 01:29:31,455
That's three.

922
01:29:32,789 --> 01:29:34,458
Armando in the plaza.

923
01:29:34,541 --> 01:29:35,751
That's four.

924
01:29:37,085 --> 01:29:39,546
And Jorge and Memo
in the pass,

925
01:29:39,630 --> 01:29:41,215
where they were caught
by that cursed net.

926
01:29:41,298 --> 01:29:42,549
Damn them!

927
01:29:42,633 --> 01:29:44,927
Five and six.

928
01:29:45,010 --> 01:29:47,596
Emilio going
over the wall.

929
01:29:48,305 --> 01:29:49,807
Seven.

930
01:29:49,890 --> 01:29:52,309
JosГ© near
the fountain.

931
01:29:57,314 --> 01:29:58,899
Eight.

932
01:29:58,982 --> 01:30:00,651
Gregorio near
the fountain.

933
01:30:07,658 --> 01:30:09,201
That's nine.

934
01:30:11,161 --> 01:30:12,496
Nine.

935
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:15,374
Fortuno by
the water ditch.

936
01:30:15,457 --> 01:30:18,001
Rico in the fields,
where they slashed him to pieces!

937
01:30:20,963 --> 01:30:22,965
That's... 10 and 11.

938
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:26,552
Go on.

939
01:30:26,635 --> 01:30:28,595
Talk.

940
01:30:28,679 --> 01:30:30,764
Talk! Talk!

941
01:30:33,350 --> 01:30:36,270
They're all dead anyway.
Forget about them.

942
01:30:37,104 --> 01:30:40,691
There's still plenty
of us here... to make them pay.

943
01:30:42,276 --> 01:30:44,570
Our friends down below.

944
01:30:56,123 --> 01:30:57,708
Please, no!

945
01:31:10,804 --> 01:31:13,474
It's all right.
You're all right.

946
01:31:13,557 --> 01:31:16,560
You had a dream.
Just a bad dream.

947
01:31:22,900 --> 01:31:24,401
Have no fear.

948
01:31:27,571 --> 01:31:29,698
"Have no fear"?

949
01:31:32,242 --> 01:31:34,411
My very words.

950
01:31:35,412 --> 01:31:37,998
10,000 times a day.

951
01:31:38,081 --> 01:31:40,751
SeГ±or, don't
punish yourself.

952
01:31:41,084 --> 01:31:45,589
A man who has fought so many times...
You must have great courage.

953
01:31:54,681 --> 01:31:57,184
Until the day
you lose your nerve.

954
01:31:58,769 --> 01:32:00,896
You feel it.

955
01:32:02,231 --> 01:32:04,274
And then you wait,...

956
01:32:05,359 --> 01:32:08,779
...for the bullet
in the gun that is faster than yours.

957
01:32:08,862 --> 01:32:10,322
SeГ±or, don't.

958
01:32:10,405 --> 01:32:13,325
And the lies you tell,
to fool yourself.

959
01:32:14,701 --> 01:32:16,286
No enemies:

960
01:32:17,204 --> 01:32:18,789
alive.

961
01:32:21,583 --> 01:32:24,711
I have lost count
of my enemies.

962
01:32:25,462 --> 01:32:27,256
But you're
with friends now.

963
01:32:27,339 --> 01:32:29,091
Yes.

964
01:32:29,174 --> 01:32:31,969
The final,
supreme idiocy:

965
01:32:33,554 --> 01:32:35,848
comin' here to hide.

966
01:32:37,391 --> 01:32:42,396
The deserter...
hidin' out in the middle of a battlefield.

967
01:32:59,788 --> 01:33:01,165
One.

968
01:33:03,625 --> 01:33:07,004
There was a time
when I woulda caught all three.

969
01:33:20,017 --> 01:33:22,603
We know what fear is.

970
01:33:22,686 --> 01:33:25,314
We live with it
all our lives.

971
01:33:26,648 --> 01:33:28,859
Only the dead
are without fear.

972
01:33:39,703 --> 01:33:47,753
Rico!

973
01:33:47,836 --> 01:33:50,214
One minute,
Mother!

974
01:33:50,714 --> 01:33:54,468
Ten minutes to pretend we're asleep, and
then we'll be back on duty.

975
01:33:54,551 --> 01:33:56,637
All right, Bernardo?

976
01:33:56,720 --> 01:33:58,180
Yes, but not you, Juan.

977
01:33:58,263 --> 01:34:00,557
You're too young.
Come on.

978
01:34:04,728 --> 01:34:06,855
Bernardo O'Reilly!

979
01:34:07,523 --> 01:34:09,233
You've been adopted.

980
01:34:10,818 --> 01:34:12,569
Yeah, it's my real name.

981
01:34:12,653 --> 01:34:16,365
Mexican on one side,
Irish on the other, and me in the middle.

982
01:34:20,577 --> 01:34:22,913
Now, watch carefully.
Here we go.

983
01:34:24,748 --> 01:34:27,668
See? All three,
right side up.

984
01:34:27,751 --> 01:34:28,710
Think you can do it?

985
01:34:28,794 --> 01:34:31,171
Of course.
That's very easy.

986
01:34:31,255 --> 01:34:35,008
Would you, uh... care
to make a friendly wager? A little bet?

987
01:34:35,092 --> 01:34:36,718
You know we
have no money.

988
01:34:36,802 --> 01:34:38,178
It doesn't have
to be money.

989
01:34:38,262 --> 01:34:42,599
Whatever you have hidden away, buried
out where Calvera can't find it.

990
01:34:42,724 --> 01:34:44,184
- Like jewels.
- Jewels?!

991
01:34:44,268 --> 01:34:48,939
Yeah. They tell me a lotta precious stones
have been dug out of the mountains.

992
01:34:49,022 --> 01:34:51,775
Opals, emeralds...
sapphires.

993
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:53,861
Oh, yes. Yes,
that's very true.

994
01:34:53,944 --> 01:34:55,529
There's no denyin' it.

995
01:34:55,612 --> 01:34:57,531
Well, then!

996
01:35:00,951 --> 01:35:04,204
No! When you're finished,
they should all be right side up.

997
01:35:04,288 --> 01:35:06,582
Let me try
it again, eh?

998
01:35:11,128 --> 01:35:14,381
About those precious stones...
Where are they found?

999
01:35:14,465 --> 01:35:17,134
As you say, seГ±or,
in the mountains.

1000
01:35:17,259 --> 01:35:18,886
Where
in the mountains?

1001
01:35:18,969 --> 01:35:20,554
That I couldn't tell you.

1002
01:35:20,637 --> 01:35:22,347
There! I got it!

1003
01:35:22,431 --> 01:35:25,517
Never mind that.
Why can't you tell me?

1004
01:35:25,642 --> 01:35:28,312
Because I never
have found any precious stones.

1005
01:35:28,604 --> 01:35:34,568
Wait. You mean Aztec treasure buried in
the hills, from when the Spaniards came?

1006
01:35:34,651 --> 01:35:39,323
That's exactly what I mean. Aztec
treasure. Have you found some?

1007
01:35:39,448 --> 01:35:42,326
Would to God we had!
I would not be sitting here.

1008
01:35:42,451 --> 01:35:45,245
I'd be living
in a big city, in a palace.

1009
01:35:45,329 --> 01:35:48,916
Then tell me this - how come
Calvera keeps hangin' around here?

1010
01:35:48,999 --> 01:35:53,086
Calvera... We've seen the end of him. He'll
be gone in the morning.

1011
01:35:53,170 --> 01:35:54,838
No, he will not.

1012
01:35:57,424 --> 01:35:58,842
He won't go anywhere.

1013
01:35:58,926 --> 01:36:00,385
Why do you say that?

1014
01:36:00,469 --> 01:36:02,930
Calvera isn't worried
about food for winter.

1015
01:36:03,013 --> 01:36:06,892
He's worried about the food his men
haven't eaten for the last three days.

1016
01:36:08,685 --> 01:36:11,438
The price of corn
is going up.

1017
01:36:11,522 --> 01:36:13,065
They're starving.

1018
01:36:13,148 --> 01:36:14,900
How do you know?

1019
01:36:14,983 --> 01:36:16,985
Starving and broke.

1020
01:36:17,069 --> 01:36:18,904
How do you know?!

1021
01:36:19,863 --> 01:36:21,198
Oh...

1022
01:36:22,991 --> 01:36:25,035
I've been up there.

1023
01:36:26,703 --> 01:36:29,623
Well, we'd better
be ready for them.

1024
01:36:29,706 --> 01:36:31,583
Because they
gotta die or win.

1025
01:36:31,667 --> 01:36:34,378
VГЎlgame Dios
if they do win.

1026
01:36:34,461 --> 01:36:35,671
They won't win.

1027
01:36:35,754 --> 01:36:37,881
Are you God,
that you can say for sure?

1028
01:36:37,965 --> 01:36:40,968
We're surrounded.
Outnumbered. What are we to do?

1029
01:36:41,051 --> 01:36:43,554
Keep on fighting.

1030
01:36:43,637 --> 01:36:45,889
Do you want to see us
killed off one by one?

1031
01:36:46,014 --> 01:36:48,058
That is not what
you were hired for.

1032
01:36:49,143 --> 01:36:50,644
Once you start,
there's no stopping.

1033
01:36:50,727 --> 01:36:52,479
You understood that,
and I told him!

1034
01:36:52,563 --> 01:36:54,398
I don't care.

1035
01:36:54,481 --> 01:36:57,776
Go away. All of you.
Get on your horses and go.

1036
01:36:57,860 --> 01:36:59,403
Let Calvera
have the food.

1037
01:36:59,486 --> 01:37:00,654
Give him what he wants.

1038
01:37:00,737 --> 01:37:02,239
At least we'll be alive.

1039
01:37:02,322 --> 01:37:03,949
Quiet!
And listen to me!

1040
01:37:04,032 --> 01:37:06,660
No! It is easy
for them to say fight.

1041
01:37:06,743 --> 01:37:10,247
They have no sons,
no daughters, no wives.

1042
01:37:10,330 --> 01:37:12,749
Go. Now, before
it's too late.

1043
01:37:19,381 --> 01:37:20,924
Is that what you want?

1044
01:37:22,384 --> 01:37:23,927
Answer me!

1045
01:37:24,261 --> 01:37:27,931
Who's for going on and who's for giving
up? I want to know now.

1046
01:37:35,189 --> 01:37:38,859
Don't be fools!
You'll turn our village into a graveyard.

1047
01:37:38,942 --> 01:37:42,362
Tell them to go.
It's the only thing for them to do.

1048
01:37:42,446 --> 01:37:44,615
I'll tell you
what I can do.

1049
01:37:44,740 --> 01:37:48,702
I can kill the first man who so much as
whispers a word about giving up.

1050
01:37:48,785 --> 01:37:51,955
The very first man,
so help me, I'll blow his head off!

1051
01:38:17,815 --> 01:38:22,236
We started this fight...
and we're gonna finish it!

1052
01:38:22,319 --> 01:38:24,488
With or without you.

1053
01:38:39,336 --> 01:38:41,421
I'm not sayin' we bit off
more than we can chew,...

1054
01:38:41,505 --> 01:38:44,675
...but we oughta
talk about what we're gonna do.

1055
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:47,344
We start acting
like we had some good sense.

1056
01:38:47,469 --> 01:38:51,348
We figured to raise the ante just enough to
make Calvera play someplace else.

1057
01:38:51,473 --> 01:38:52,808
We figured wrong.

1058
01:38:52,891 --> 01:38:54,893
We're the only
game in town.

1059
01:38:54,977 --> 01:38:56,270
A man can't call 'em all.

1060
01:38:56,353 --> 01:38:57,437
I didn't say he could.

1061
01:38:57,521 --> 01:39:01,942
All I'm saying is that sometimes you bend
with the breeze... or you break.

1062
01:39:04,611 --> 01:39:06,363
D'you wanna go?

1063
01:39:06,530 --> 01:39:12,035
There comes a time to get out. The village
will be no worse off than before we came.

1064
01:39:12,119 --> 01:39:15,539
You forget one thing.
We took a contract.

1065
01:39:15,664 --> 01:39:17,666
It's not the kind
courts enforce.

1066
01:39:17,749 --> 01:39:19,626
That's just the kind
you've gotta keep.

1067
01:39:19,710 --> 01:39:23,213
A noble thought,
but the way things are right now,...

1068
01:39:25,174 --> 01:39:26,425
...I don't know.

1069
01:39:26,508 --> 01:39:28,635
The odds are too high.

1070
01:39:28,719 --> 01:39:30,637
- Much too high.
- Then we go?

1071
01:39:30,721 --> 01:39:32,097
No.

1072
01:39:34,475 --> 01:39:36,810
We lower the odds.

1073
01:39:36,894 --> 01:39:39,313
Right up
into the hills,...

1074
01:39:39,396 --> 01:39:41,482
...past the men
on guard,...

1075
01:39:41,565 --> 01:39:43,150
...right into their camp.

1076
01:39:46,236 --> 01:39:50,407
I sat there, I smoked a cigarette with
them, we discussed a few things.

1077
01:39:53,035 --> 01:39:55,078
We... you know...

1078
01:39:56,079 --> 01:39:58,540
All of a sudden,
there was Calvera himself.

1079
01:40:01,251 --> 01:40:05,088
Right beside me.
When I brought back the news,...

1080
01:40:05,172 --> 01:40:09,676
...you should have seen
the look I got from Britt - and from Chris.

1081
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:13,764
They have seen a thing
or two in their time, and done them too.

1082
01:40:13,889 --> 01:40:16,767
They're not men
you can impress easily. Oh, no.

1083
01:40:17,810 --> 01:40:22,147
But when they looked at me,
I knew I was one of them at last.

1084
01:40:27,569 --> 01:40:29,488
Well,...

1085
01:40:29,571 --> 01:40:32,282
...you'd better take
a look at me, too.

1086
01:40:32,407 --> 01:40:36,537
Am I the kind of man
who'd live in a place like this? Hm?

1087
01:40:37,454 --> 01:40:40,040
Digging my life away
out in the fields?

1088
01:40:40,123 --> 01:40:42,417
Me, a farmer -
a peasant?

1089
01:40:44,628 --> 01:40:47,381
You know what
I'm saying, huh?

1090
01:40:47,464 --> 01:40:51,301
Wherever they go -
Chris, Vin, Britt, the others -

1091
01:40:52,427 --> 01:40:53,804
I go with them.

1092
01:40:56,056 --> 01:40:59,309
And if you think you,
or anything you do,

1093
01:40:59,393 --> 01:41:01,728
could make me change
my mind, forget it.

1094
01:41:04,064 --> 01:41:06,441
I want you
to understand that.

1095
01:41:08,235 --> 01:41:10,946
I... want you
to understand that...

1096
01:41:14,074 --> 01:41:15,367
...this...

1097
01:41:24,168 --> 01:41:26,378
...will get you
nothing but this.

1098
01:41:29,631 --> 01:41:32,593
We're going
to hit Calvera,...

1099
01:41:32,676 --> 01:41:35,762
...maybe drive off
some of his horses.

1100
01:41:35,846 --> 01:41:38,515
Then if he attacks,
he'll be on foot.

1101
01:41:38,599 --> 01:41:40,934
I'll go with you.
I know every rock.

1102
01:41:41,018 --> 01:41:43,395
No, you stay.
You're in charge here.

1103
01:41:43,479 --> 01:41:45,355
You can count on me.

1104
01:41:47,524 --> 01:41:48,942
I know I can.

1105
01:42:45,582 --> 01:42:47,626
They've left
to hit the village.

1106
01:42:47,709 --> 01:42:49,670
No.

1107
01:42:49,753 --> 01:42:51,755
We'd have heard shots.

1108
01:42:54,842 --> 01:42:56,760
They've gone.

1109
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:31,795
Good evening.

1110
01:43:54,401 --> 01:43:56,653
You'll be dead.
All of you!

1111
01:43:57,488 --> 01:43:58,989
Like that!

1112
01:43:59,072 --> 01:44:01,492
If that's what you want.

1113
01:44:01,617 --> 01:44:02,993
Do we have a choice?

1114
01:44:06,663 --> 01:44:08,165
Of course.

1115
01:44:08,999 --> 01:44:11,001
Sit down.

1116
01:44:11,168 --> 01:44:13,295
Let's talk.

1117
01:44:15,839 --> 01:44:18,842
Things are turned
around now, uh?

1118
01:44:19,009 --> 01:44:21,929
You're wondering how.

1119
01:44:22,012 --> 01:44:25,265
Your friends,
they don't like you very much anymore.

1120
01:44:25,349 --> 01:44:28,018
You force them
to make too many decisions.

1121
01:44:28,143 --> 01:44:30,687
With me...
only one decision.

1122
01:44:30,771 --> 01:44:32,856
Do what I say.

1123
01:44:32,981 --> 01:44:35,275
You should not be surprised.

1124
01:44:35,359 --> 01:44:39,863
My good friend Sotero,
he arranged to let me come in.

1125
01:44:40,614 --> 01:44:42,699
Understand?

1126
01:44:45,702 --> 01:44:48,080
Well, anyway,...

1127
01:44:48,330 --> 01:44:50,874
...to business!

1128
01:44:50,999 --> 01:44:53,794
I could kill you all.
You agree?

1129
01:45:05,097 --> 01:45:07,558
Well... you
don't disagree.

1130
01:45:09,017 --> 01:45:11,937
Anyway, I don't
want to kill you.

1131
01:45:12,020 --> 01:45:13,605
Why so generous?

1132
01:45:14,857 --> 01:45:17,985
Practical. They hear
about it up north.

1133
01:45:18,068 --> 01:45:21,238
Maybe some friends
of yours make more trouble for me.

1134
01:45:21,321 --> 01:45:24,241
A man who never
wants no trouble.

1135
01:45:25,409 --> 01:45:27,995
We have a saying here.

1136
01:45:28,078 --> 01:45:32,166
A thief who steals
from a thief is pardoned for 100 years.

1137
01:45:32,249 --> 01:45:33,333
All right,
what does that leave?

1138
01:45:33,417 --> 01:45:36,378
Only one thing.
I pardon you.

1139
01:45:38,088 --> 01:45:39,923
Ride on.

1140
01:45:40,007 --> 01:45:41,008
Just like that?

1141
01:45:41,091 --> 01:45:43,302
Mm, just like...

1142
01:45:43,677 --> 01:45:47,931
I'll make it easy
for you. You want food?

1143
01:45:48,056 --> 01:45:49,766
Give them food.

1144
01:45:49,850 --> 01:45:52,352
Water?
All right. Water.

1145
01:45:52,436 --> 01:45:55,314
Horses?
Saddled and waiting.

1146
01:45:55,397 --> 01:45:56,648
Guns?

1147
01:45:59,193 --> 01:46:03,071
The guns... the gun belts,
you take off and put here now.

1148
01:46:09,203 --> 01:46:11,955
What about
these people?

1149
01:46:12,039 --> 01:46:17,127
What happens to these people
will happen whether I kill you first or not.

1150
01:46:25,010 --> 01:46:27,387
Just a little
gesture, huh?

1151
01:46:28,305 --> 01:46:32,059
To show these people
who the real boss is.

1152
01:46:32,142 --> 01:46:35,229
You go, then I give
you the guns back.

1153
01:46:36,271 --> 01:46:38,982
I know you won't
use those guns against me.

1154
01:46:39,066 --> 01:46:42,486
Only a crazy man
makes the same mistake twice.

1155
01:47:10,514 --> 01:47:16,103
I don't understand why a man like you took
the job in the first place. Hm? Why?

1156
01:47:16,186 --> 01:47:17,771
I wonder myself.

1157
01:47:17,855 --> 01:47:20,774
No, come on.
Come on, tell me why.

1158
01:47:20,858 --> 01:47:24,611
A fella I knew in El Paso took all his
clothes off and jumped on a cactus.

1159
01:47:24,695 --> 01:47:26,947
I asked him
the same question: why?

1160
01:47:27,698 --> 01:47:29,116
And?

1161
01:47:29,199 --> 01:47:32,411
He said "It seemed
to be a good idea at the time."

1162
01:48:11,783 --> 01:48:13,160
Good!

1163
01:48:14,578 --> 01:48:15,996
Right.

1164
01:48:16,079 --> 01:48:20,876
Go get your clothes, your
saddlebags. Anything you want, take it.

1165
01:48:20,959 --> 01:48:23,212
Your friends
in there owe you at least that much.

1166
01:48:23,295 --> 01:48:27,007
Santos,
pick up the carbines. Cirillo, the guns.

1167
01:48:42,022 --> 01:48:45,317
You know,
the first time I took a job as a hired gun,...

1168
01:48:45,609 --> 01:48:48,445
...a fella told me
"Vin, you can't afford to care."

1169
01:48:50,113 --> 01:48:51,782
There's your problem.

1170
01:48:51,865 --> 01:48:54,993
One thing I don't need
is somebody telling me my problem.

1171
01:48:55,077 --> 01:48:57,538
Like I said before,
that's your problem.

1172
01:48:57,621 --> 01:49:00,415
You got involved
in this village and the people in it.

1173
01:49:02,918 --> 01:49:06,296
Do you ever
get tired of hearing yourself talk?

1174
01:49:06,380 --> 01:49:09,424
The reason I understand
your problem so well...

1175
01:49:10,801 --> 01:49:13,303
...is that I walked into
the same trap myself.

1176
01:49:14,888 --> 01:49:16,473
Yeah.

1177
01:49:16,598 --> 01:49:19,977
The first day
we got here, I started thinking...

1178
01:49:20,102 --> 01:49:23,981
...maybe I could put my gun away and
settle down and get a little land,...

1179
01:49:24,064 --> 01:49:25,774
...raise some cattle.

1180
01:49:25,858 --> 01:49:30,571
The things that these people know about
me wouldn't work against me.

1181
01:49:30,904 --> 01:49:35,951
I, uh... just didn't want you to think you
were the only sucker in town.

1182
01:49:53,844 --> 01:49:55,637
Can we go
with you, Bernardo?

1183
01:49:55,721 --> 01:49:56,847
No.

1184
01:49:56,930 --> 01:49:58,307
You like us,
don't you?

1185
01:49:58,390 --> 01:49:59,516
I guess so.

1186
01:49:59,600 --> 01:50:01,935
You're one of us,
aren't you?

1187
01:50:02,019 --> 01:50:03,604
Yeah, I'm one
of us all right.

1188
01:50:03,687 --> 01:50:05,105
Take us with you!
Please?!

1189
01:50:05,189 --> 01:50:06,190
No!

1190
01:50:06,315 --> 01:50:10,652
We're ashamed
to live here. Our fathers are... cowards.

1191
01:50:15,616 --> 01:50:17,701
Don't ever say
that again about your fathers.

1192
01:50:17,784 --> 01:50:19,578
They are not cowards!

1193
01:50:22,372 --> 01:50:24,958
You think I am brave
because I carry a gun.

1194
01:50:25,042 --> 01:50:28,712
Your fathers are much
braver because they carry responsibility.

1195
01:50:28,796 --> 01:50:31,632
For you, your brothers,
your sisters and your mothers.

1196
01:50:31,715 --> 01:50:35,302
This responsibility
is like a big rock that weighs a ton.

1197
01:50:35,385 --> 01:50:39,681
It bends and it twists them until finally it
buries them under the ground.

1198
01:50:39,765 --> 01:50:41,475
Nobody says
they have to do it.

1199
01:50:41,558 --> 01:50:44,228
They do it because
they love you and they want to.

1200
01:50:46,188 --> 01:50:49,233
I have never had
this kind of courage.

1201
01:50:50,901 --> 01:50:52,653
Running a farm,...

1202
01:50:52,736 --> 01:50:56,573
...working like a mule,
with no guarantee what will become of it -

1203
01:50:56,657 --> 01:50:58,283
this is bravery.

1204
01:51:00,494 --> 01:51:03,455
That's why I never
even started anything like that.

1205
01:51:03,539 --> 01:51:04,957
That's why I never will.

1206
01:51:20,764 --> 01:51:23,767
You'll do much better
on the other side of the border.

1207
01:51:23,851 --> 01:51:27,104
There you can
steal cattle, hold up trains.

1208
01:51:27,187 --> 01:51:31,191
All you have to face
is a sheriff, a marshal.

1209
01:51:31,608 --> 01:51:33,569
Once I rob
a bank in Texas.

1210
01:51:33,652 --> 01:51:37,531
Your government got after me with a
whole army. A whole army!

1211
01:51:37,614 --> 01:51:41,118
One little bank.
It's clear, the meaning?

1212
01:51:41,451 --> 01:51:44,621
In Texas, only Texans
can rob banks!

1213
01:51:53,213 --> 01:52:42,304
AdiГіs!

1214
01:52:51,522 --> 01:52:54,483
I could have told you
they'd sell us out.

1215
01:53:09,915 --> 01:53:11,542
Farmers...

1216
01:53:12,376 --> 01:53:13,669
Farmers!

1217
01:53:13,877 --> 01:53:16,713
No honor,
no loyalty - nothin'.

1218
01:53:18,048 --> 01:53:23,137
All they care about is their precious crops
and the miserable dirt they dig in.

1219
01:53:25,889 --> 01:53:27,558
I hate 'em.

1220
01:53:29,226 --> 01:53:30,811
I hate 'em all.

1221
01:53:30,894 --> 01:53:32,521
Sure you hate them.

1222
01:53:34,731 --> 01:53:38,068
Because you come
from a village just like that one.

1223
01:53:38,152 --> 01:53:40,487
You yourself are a farmer.

1224
01:53:43,198 --> 01:53:44,783
Yes.

1225
01:53:45,659 --> 01:53:47,286
Yes, I'm one of them.

1226
01:53:49,246 --> 01:53:52,040
But who made us
the way we are? Hm?

1227
01:53:52,749 --> 01:53:55,043
Men with guns.

1228
01:53:55,836 --> 01:53:58,046
Men like Calvera and...

1229
01:53:59,339 --> 01:54:01,091
...men like you.

1230
01:54:02,593 --> 01:54:04,595
And now me.

1231
01:54:08,432 --> 01:54:10,934
So what d'you
expect us to be?

1232
01:54:17,691 --> 01:54:20,986
Nobody throws me
my own guns and says run. Nobody.

1233
01:54:22,279 --> 01:54:26,700
It took me a long, long time to learn
my elbow from a hot rock.

1234
01:54:27,701 --> 01:54:31,663
Right now, I belong back in that border
town, sleepin' on white sheets.

1235
01:54:35,459 --> 01:54:37,961
I think I'll ride back
to that village.

1236
01:54:39,296 --> 01:54:44,468
You're crazy, all of ya! They won't lift a
finger to help. Think of the odds.

1237
01:54:45,469 --> 01:54:48,972
Harry... nobody's
asking you to go back.

1238
01:54:49,973 --> 01:54:53,060
Ride on, Harry.
It's all right.

1239
01:54:53,143 --> 01:54:55,813
Bet your sweet life,
I will!

1240
01:55:01,985 --> 01:55:04,988
Come on, Lee.
They wanna get killed? Let 'em.

1241
01:55:05,072 --> 01:55:09,159
Go ahead, Lee.
You don't owe anything to anybody.

1242
01:55:10,494 --> 01:55:12,788
Except to myself.

1243
01:55:25,968 --> 01:55:28,178
You're crazy!
All of ya!

1244
01:55:28,262 --> 01:55:30,681
Come on. Ya!

1245
01:58:12,176 --> 01:58:14,344
Hold on, Chris,
I'll get ya outta there!

1246
01:58:54,301 --> 01:58:55,302
Chris...

1247
01:58:55,385 --> 01:58:56,762
Yes, Harry?

1248
01:58:56,845 --> 01:58:58,889
I'd hate
to die a sucker.

1249
01:58:59,139 --> 01:59:03,060
We didn't come here just to keep an eye on
a lotta corn and chilli peppers.

1250
01:59:03,143 --> 01:59:06,063
There was something else
all the time, wasn't there?

1251
01:59:06,188 --> 01:59:09,817
Yes, Harry.
You had it pegged right all along.

1252
01:59:09,900 --> 01:59:11,527
I knew it.

1253
01:59:11,610 --> 01:59:13,237
What was it?

1254
01:59:14,071 --> 01:59:16,073
Gold.

1255
01:59:16,156 --> 01:59:17,366
Sacks of it.

1256
01:59:17,449 --> 01:59:20,536
Oh... sounds beautiful!

1257
01:59:21,245 --> 01:59:22,496
How much?

1258
01:59:22,579 --> 01:59:24,665
At least
a half a million.

1259
01:59:24,748 --> 01:59:26,500
My cut woulda
been what?

1260
01:59:26,583 --> 01:59:28,418
About 70,000.

1261
01:59:30,045 --> 01:59:31,380
I'll be damned!

1262
01:59:40,931 --> 01:59:42,099
Maybe you won't be.

1263
02:02:16,670 --> 02:02:18,380
You came back.

1264
02:02:19,381 --> 02:02:21,884
For a place like this.

1265
02:02:22,259 --> 02:02:24,303
Why?

1266
02:02:24,470 --> 02:02:26,430
A man like you?!

1267
02:02:27,723 --> 02:02:29,308
Why?

1268
02:03:04,051 --> 02:03:06,178
Bernardo!
Bernardo!

1269
02:03:06,261 --> 02:03:08,305
No. No, get back.
Go on! Get back.

1270
02:03:19,441 --> 02:03:22,152
We didn't...
We didn't mean to do it.

1271
02:03:22,236 --> 02:03:24,613
We didn't mean
to do it.

1272
02:03:29,243 --> 02:03:30,953
You see?

1273
02:03:31,662 --> 02:03:34,164
I told you.
You see your fathers?

1274
02:03:44,174 --> 02:03:46,093
What's my name?

1275
02:03:46,176 --> 02:03:47,511
Bernardo.

1276
02:03:47,594 --> 02:03:49,346
Bernardo!

1277
02:03:51,098 --> 02:03:53,517
You're damn right.

1278
02:04:43,192 --> 02:04:45,486
You could stay,
you know.

1279
02:04:45,569 --> 02:04:48,572
They wouldn't be sorry
to have you stay.

1280
02:04:49,156 --> 02:04:50,991
They won't be sorry
to see us go, either.

1281
02:04:51,074 --> 02:04:54,286
Yes.
The fighting is over.

1282
02:04:54,369 --> 02:04:56,371
Your work is done.

1283
02:04:56,455 --> 02:05:00,083
For them,
each season has its tasks.

1284
02:05:01,168 --> 02:05:05,255
If there were a season for
gratitude, they'd show it more.

1285
02:05:06,381 --> 02:05:08,926
We didn't get
anymore than we expected, old man.

1286
02:05:10,969 --> 02:05:13,388
Only the farmers have won.

1287
02:05:14,556 --> 02:05:16,892
They remain forever.

1288
02:05:16,975 --> 02:05:19,978
They are like
the land itself.

1289
02:05:20,938 --> 02:05:23,607
You helped
to rid them of Calvera,...

1290
02:05:24,274 --> 02:05:27,945
...the way a strong wind
helps rid them of locusts.

1291
02:05:29,571 --> 02:05:31,824
You are like the wind,...

1292
02:05:32,282 --> 02:05:35,911
...blowing over the land
and passing on.

1293
02:05:39,998 --> 02:05:42,334
God be with you.

1294
02:05:44,628 --> 02:06:39,016
AdiГіs.

1295
02:07:11,215 --> 02:07:13,801
The old man was right.

1296
02:07:13,884 --> 02:07:16,053
Only the farmers won.

1297
02:07:16,136 --> 02:07:17,596
We lost.

1298
02:07:18,889 --> 02:07:20,808
We always lose.
