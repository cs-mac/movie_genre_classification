1
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:48,734
Still not done with the glasses ?
Get a move on !

2
00:01:50,152 --> 00:01:54,114
No, put it further back
so everything will fit !

3
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:57,117
Good !
Let's make it quick.

4
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:00,621
Leaving already ?

5
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:03,790
Piss off, Saman ! I clocked in an hour
before everyone else.

6
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,792
See you Monday, payday.

7
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,128
We'll see...

8
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:09,796
We'll see, my ass !

9
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:41,012
HUMAN CAPITAL

10
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:49,396
SIX MONTHS EARLIER

11
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:58,405
- Here is fine.
- The gate's open.

12
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,031
Leave me here.

13
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:03,368
- Just stop.
- What's the problem, honey ?

14
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,912
- I'll drop you off.
- No.

15
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,498
What a pain. I knew it !

16
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,294
Look at this.
Not too bad, Bernaschi !

17
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:15,547
- How many acres do you think this is ?
- Who cares !

18
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:23,054
CHAPTER 1
DINO

19
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,060
- All right, bye.
- Bye.

20
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,900
- Morning.
- Good morning, Carla.

21
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,819
- Is Massimiliano inside '?
- He has a surprise for you.

22
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,783
- Hello. - Is that your dad ?
- Yes, but he's leaving.

23
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,826
I'd like to meet him.

24
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:49,206
But I'm rushing off,
I have a hectic day ahead of me.

25
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,794
I'm Serena's dad,
she asked me to drop her off...

26
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,172
We've probably crossed paths
at our kids' school !

27
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:59,716
Dino Ossola, nice to meet you.

28
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:02,302
You know, all of us here
adore Serena !

29
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:06,723
She always talks about you too,
I'm somewhat jealous !

30
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:10,227
I'd better go,
I have an urgent meeting,

31
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:15,106
- otherwise we could've had coffee
with Giovanni too. - No worries.

32
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:19,569
I have a "hardcore"
day ahead of me too ! No of fence...

33
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:21,363
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

34
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,490
Let's go, we're late.

35
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,386
- It went long !
- Hello !

36
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:48,723
I'm Serena's dad,
I just dropped her off.

37
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,726
- This place is stunning.
- Do you play ?

38
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,729
- We need a fourth.
- I've hit a few balls.

39
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:57,023
I could go home and get my things.

40
00:05:57,148 --> 00:06:00,527
You'll find what you need
in the locker room, interested ?

41
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,285
Yes !

42
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:13,123
- A wicked serve !
- You're a whiz at the net.

43
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,166
They won't win a single game.

44
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,419
Dino!

45
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:19,546
Let's kill them !

46
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,052
All right!

47
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:31,558
So... is it true what they say about
the Bernaschi hedge fund ?

48
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,685
Depends on what they're saying.

49
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,564
There's talk of 40-50% return...

50
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:41,443
He had us sell America
and buy Brazil

51
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,570
six months before everyone else.

52
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:48,325
- But you didn't hear that from me.
- Of course.

53
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:53,955
- Some game !
- Giovanni, blame it on doping !

54
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,959
It's all in the legs.
We danced on the court.

55
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:01,463
The racket I used wasn't bad either.

56
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:06,343
You've got a good serve.
You've played professionally ?

57
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:11,348
I was a semi-pro,
but 20 years and <i>22</i> pounds ago.

58
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,937
- You work in real estate ?
- Yes. - The market's booming.

59
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,856
- Lucky you.
- I can't complain.

60
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:24,194
My father said:
"Homes and coffins are always needed".

61
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:30,241
It's true, anyone can make
a living this way.

62
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:34,829
I'm almost tempted to take
a risk on something more... no ?

63
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,457
Otherwise life is a drag.

64
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:42,963
Dino, you realize
you've gotten yourself into a fix ?

65
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:47,884
- Why, did I say something wrong ?
- You and I are top dogs !

66
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:53,014
- You'll have to come every Friday.
- Right, we're a team.

67
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:55,850
We complete each other:
I serve, you close.

68
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,519
Merciless !

69
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:00,480
- Bye, see you soon.
- Hey, I was wondering...

70
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:03,024
now might not be the right time

71
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:06,778
but seeing there's a good vibe
between us... - Yes ?

72
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,616
Not to mention the kids...

73
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:14,911
Aren't they adorable together ?

74
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,872
You want to buy into our fund.

75
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:21,251
Wow, you can read my mind !

76
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,922
Yes, I was thinking about
a small share.

77
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:32,303
- Our minimum is 500.
- 500,000 ?

78
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,057
- Yes.
- That's fine.

79
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:38,643
Even 600,000 or 700,000.

80
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,646
Think it over and let me know.

81
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,692
Come see me at the Milan office.

82
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:49,529
- Thursday at 8:30 ?
- Thursday at 8:30, perfect !

83
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:52,574
My man, Giovanni !
You and I are a powerhouse.

84
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:03,543
Hello dear,
the big boss is expecting me.

85
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:07,839
Why that face ?

86
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:13,053
- Did you read the business plan ?
Read it ! - I read it.

87
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,306
You want to expand,
hire, buy land...

88
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:19,726
And you're certain you'll have
a 30% return within a year.

89
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,353
30-40%, Giampiero,
it's a conservative estimate.

90
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:27,442
It's not exactly a gift, you know...

91
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,861
You'll give me 700,000

92
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:33,615
but I'm using my house as collateral,
it's worth at least 900.

93
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,325
Your house ?

94
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:38,703
You put it in Serena's name
during the divorce.

95
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,372
Yes, of course, but Serena agrees.

96
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:45,585
We need her signature. I have
to convince the general managers.

97
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:49,130
You're awesome !
I'll leave this for you.

98
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:54,135
What does Roberta think ?
Dino, you did tell her ?

99
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:57,764
Of course ! She agrees too.

100
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:12,278
Roby, honey ?

101
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:14,405
In here.

102
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:25,416
Come here, sit down.

103
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:31,422
Are you upset with me ?
What have I done ?

104
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,677
I couldn't believe it was positive,

105
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,056
so I did the blood test.
I just got the results.

106
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,433
My beta levels are sky-high.

107
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,895
Rm Pregnant !

108
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:49,190
That's great news, isn't it ?

109
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:55,071
- Some enthusiasm !
- It's the last thing I expected to hear.

110
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,699
You're telling me ! Isn't it crazy ?

111
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:03,037
- We have space, right ?
- We more or less have money...

112
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,789
<i>We do.</i>

113
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,042
Serena can stay in your study,
since you never use it.

114
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:13,214
- Her room will become the baby's room.
- You've got it all planned.

115
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,718
Serena came to the clinic...

116
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:22,056
I wanted to tell her but...
I thought it was best you told her.

117
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,933
Yes, I'll tell her.

118
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,060
Honey!

119
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,865
The investor must acknowledge
he's aware of the high risk

120
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,744
and illiquidity of the product.

121
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,747
Perrier? Fiji? Evian?

122
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:49,584
Oh, water !
You decide, I trust you.

123
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,879
My pal Bernaschi isn't here today ?

124
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:57,717
Giovanni's in a meeting right now.
I'm sure he'll come say hello.

125
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:03,139
Now, onto the next point
which clearly states that

126
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:08,102
the amount invested
must represent a percentage

127
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:13,024
that doesn't exceed
20% of your patrimony.

128
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:17,487
Sorry for the pedantry, but we must
verbalize it before you sign.

129
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,155
Fair enough.

130
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,159
And now... can I sign ?

131
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,536
Go ahead.

132
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,796
Sign by the X's.

133
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,926
Oh, what the hell !

134
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:42,553
Just kidding !

135
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:51,813
Here he is ! My man, Giovanni !

136
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:55,817
- How's everything ? I'm signing.
- Hello.

137
00:12:55,942 --> 00:13:01,447
Sorry to bail out,
but I fly to London in 30 minutes.

138
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,533
Get ready for Friday !

139
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:07,787
- Malesani's a beast at the net.
- No worries, we'll bust his ass !

140
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,580
Have a good day, fellows.

141
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,299
Where were we ?

142
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:27,849
SIX MONTHS LATER

143
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:49,495
OSSOLA REAL ESTATE

144
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:53,082
- Hey !
- Ester, what a nice surprise.

145
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:03,092
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

146
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:06,971
- Okay...
- Well ?

147
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,098
Nothing, I wanted to say...

148
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:13,728
since they asked me many times...

149
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:18,524
Allied Property is interested
in collaborating with you.

150
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:22,236
I'm sure they are,
but I'm not interested in them.

151
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,906
Want to answer ?

152
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:27,909
They'll call back, no worries.

153
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:32,163
Forgive me for saying this,
but given the recession...

154
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:35,541
...think twice before saying no.
- All right.

155
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:42,673
- Why aren't you answering my calls ?
- My man, Giampiero !

156
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:45,676
- You're not answering emails either !
- Relax with these emails...

157
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:47,804
- Let's go, I'm really late.
- Wait !

158
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:51,641
I can't. I'm going to a charity gala
at Serena's school.

159
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:55,311
Who gives a shit !
I'm risking my job because of you.

160
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:58,815
- Oh please ! - You haven't made one
payment yet, you bullshitted me.

161
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:04,195
You fired everyone
and set up office in a broom closet !

162
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,282
It's called optimizing.
You always say resources must be...

163
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,576
Look, I can't be late.

164
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,830
Know where we'll be sitting
at the school gala ?

165
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:17,291
At the Bernaschi's table,
the table of honor !

166
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:21,712
- 5,000 euro a head minimum...
- Who ? - You heard me.

167
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:24,465
Bernaschi invited me
and Roberta to his table.

168
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:28,970
He and I are buddies now,
we're tennis partners too.

169
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,347
Didn't expect that, did you ?

170
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:38,438
You used that 700,000
for Bernaschi's fund ?

171
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,318
Upset '_>

172
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,989
Not those measly things
you offer me with 2-3% returns.

173
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,491
Don't bust my balls,

174
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,618
I had to lie to get the money.

175
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,746
- I should punch you.
- You won't, you're too smart.

176
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,624
You know this is a rare opportunity.

177
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,460
This stuff is tops.

178
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:04,505
We're talking
about 40% returns, get my drift ?

179
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,384
Why did Bernaschi
let a guy like you buy in ?

180
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:15,349
You've always underestimated me.
I've got to go.

181
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,018
Evening, Mr. Ossola.

182
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,187
- Enjoy.
- Thanks, darling.

183
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,192
Crotti !

184
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,945
<i>Not now... after.</i>

185
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,281
Excuse me.

186
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,910
Attorney...

187
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:20,915
- My man, Massimiliano,
you'll win the prize tonight ! - Hope so.

188
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:25,670
...kids who are made to feel like losers

189
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,214
end up in therapy with me.

190
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:32,843
- The gravida is already on the pulpit ?
- Your wife <i>says</i>

191
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,972
all this competition
isn't good for the kids.

192
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:38,724
No such thing !
Look at Massimiliano,

193
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:42,562
- he's ready to pummel his opponents.
- We'll see.

194
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:44,605
I think it's harmful at this age.

195
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,109
It causes insecurity and anxiety.

196
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:52,321
Consider it a good thing for you,
given your line of work !

197
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,992
Look, I work in a public clinic.

198
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,369
Forgive him, he's a business lawyer,

199
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,830
he tends to only focus on profits.

200
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,841
You had to get on your soapbox...

201
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,884
We were just chatting.

202
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:21,017
- Where the hell is Serena ?
- Relax, she'll show up.

203
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:23,769
I am relaxed.

204
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:27,732
This salami looks appetizing,
let me give it a try...

205
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,234
Before I forget, we need to meet up.

206
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:33,154
- Sure, for a tennis match ?
- I wish.

207
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,783
- Tomorrow ?
- No, tomorrow I won't be free till noon.

208
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:43,372
- Okay, I'll come by at noon.
- I'll call you and confirm.

209
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:47,168
- Carla, you look fantastic !
- Sorry, I got stuck in traffic.

210
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:50,504
- Mom, it's about time.
- You look great. - Thanks.

211
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:54,759
That theater project of yours
is doing you a world of good.

212
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,137
- Serena?
- She's on her way.

213
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:00,765
- Yes.
- How are things ?

214
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:04,518
- Just fine.
- Well, I am a bit tired tonight.

215
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,689
They probably want to stay inside,
nice and warm together.

216
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,566
They're twins.

217
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:15,071
- How lovely, congratulations !
- Thanks.

218
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,198
Finally.

219
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:21,077
Good evening, sorry.

220
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,705
- What did I miss ?
- The string quartet. - Good.

221
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:37,301
Folks, it's time for the highlight
of the evening:

222
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,845
the awarding
of the Cottafavi Prize.

223
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:44,225
As you know,
each year a jury comprised of

224
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:47,728
both teachers and students,

225
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:52,566
selects a student who has stood out
in academics, sports, and friendship.

226
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,986
It is with great pleasure
that I call to the stage

227
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,447
an illustrious alumnus of this school,

228
00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:03,369
our dear friend,
Giancarlo Busdraghi !

229
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:08,582
Imagine that, Busdraghi is here !
Impressive.

230
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:13,212
- I don't feel well.
- Not now, please.

231
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,634
You didn't eat a thing,
maybe you're just hungry.

232
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,011
Contractions, I'm worried.

233
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:23,514
Don't get worked up,
drink some water.

234
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:26,892
- Do you need help ?
- She'll be fine, just low blood pressure.

235
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:30,646
- Let's not focus on it.
- Some sugar ?

236
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:34,150
No, I'm not okay,
take me to the hospital.

237
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:37,653
- Sorry.
- I'm really sorry.

238
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,613
Take care.

239
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:43,033
- We'll meet tomorrow anyway.
- Don't worry.

240
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:46,162
- Drive my car home please.
- No problem.

241
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,039
The three Cottafavi Prize finalists.

242
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:54,003
He hadn't invited me
to anything in a while...

243
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,257
Better now ? Shall we go ?

244
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:01,177
Didn't you hear what the doctor said ?

245
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,763
To wait here for him and I will wait !

246
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:07,016
- It's almost 1:00 AM.
- Then leave. - Come on...

247
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:13,314
- Who hadn't invited you ?
- Giovanni Bernaschi to play tennis !

248
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:16,942
- He said to come over tomorrow at noon.
- Please...

249
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:22,907
We used to play on Fridays,
guess he's changed the schedule.

250
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,285
All the better...

251
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,705
Meaning I ruined
the evening for nothing ?

252
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,833
You didn't ruin it...

253
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:35,294
Hurry !

254
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,937
- Morning.
- Is your wife okay ?

255
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:56,106
Yes, false alarm.
She just got worked up.

256
00:21:56,232 --> 00:22:01,237
Can you tell Serena to call me ?
Sorry, gotta run.

257
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,248
Where the hell is everyone ?

258
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:33,769
Excuse me.

259
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:42,903
Sorry, I totally forgot
about out appointment.

260
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,990
- I'm in a meeting.
- No problem.

261
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:50,286
I'll wait on the court,
warm up my serve.

262
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:53,998
Easy, I don't think
today's a day to play.

263
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:57,668
Since you're here let's have a talk.

264
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:00,880
- What is it ?
- Essentially...

265
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:04,925
some markets are proving
more volatile than we anticipated.

266
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:09,555
Everywhere we're active
is staying way overvalued.

267
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,934
Isn't that good ?
We can cash in and get out.

268
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:15,686
No, you don't get it:

269
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:19,315
we bet these markets would fall
but that hasn't happened.

270
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:22,067
<i>It hasn't...</i>

271
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:26,071
What I'm saying is your placement
has gone down substantially.

272
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:32,077
Substantially ? How much ?

273
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:36,957
- Right now it's at about 90.
- Percent ?

274
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,172
So that leaves me with 70,000...

275
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:46,050
These numbers are insignificant now,

276
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:49,303
unless you plan on pulling out
which is not advisable now.

277
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:53,432
At least you're covered
by your real estate business.

278
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:55,225
Of course.

279
00:23:55,351 --> 00:24:00,189
- False alarm for Luciana last night ?
- Roberta... everything's fine with her.

280
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,943
Sorry, I have to go,
we'll talk again another time.

281
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:06,487
So no game today, my man ?

282
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:29,510
- Excuse me, can I have minute ?
- Sorry, we're a bit busy.

283
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,762
I know, just a minute.

284
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,722
Pardon me.

285
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:36,266
Sorry.

286
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:48,612
Look, I think there's been
a lack of communication.

287
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:51,782
- What does that mean ?
- It was my fault.

288
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:55,035
I can't afford to lose that money,
I should've told you.

289
00:24:55,160 --> 00:25:01,625
- Like I said, it's temporary.
- Yes, but maybe we can make a deal.

290
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:05,546
- Meaning '?
- All I want to do is break even.

291
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:09,133
- Do you think this is a card game ?
- I've got a great idea,

292
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:12,302
tell me what you think...

293
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:15,180
You give me back my initial investment

294
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:18,434
and when the fund bounces back,
because you said it would,

295
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:23,522
you can keep it all,
even if it skyrockets. - Relax.

296
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:26,942
An agreement between me and you,
in the name of our friendship.

297
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,820
- That's not how it works.
- Listen...

298
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:33,198
that money is all I have.

299
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:37,327
Actually, I don't even have that,
understand ?

300
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:41,206
What are you saying ?
Where'd you get that 700,000 ?

301
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:45,294
I borrowed it from the bank.

302
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:48,338
Are you nuts ?

303
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:51,467
Didn't they read the terms to you ?

304
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:55,471
If you fabricated numbers,
that would be called fraud.

305
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,474
Fraud, come on !
With me and you ?

306
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:02,227
With all the respect
and genuine affection, might I say.

307
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:05,105
- Not to mention the kids...
- The kids, what '?

308
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,942
You know what, let's end
this unpleasant conversation.

309
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:13,363
Tomorrow I'll out you a check
for the balance of your placement.

310
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:17,242
Giovanni, my pal,
what'll I do with 70,000 euro ?

311
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:55,030
"Last night a cyclist was found
seriously wounded and in shock.

312
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:57,407
He's a 40-50 year old man,

313
00:26:57,491 --> 00:27:00,160
and was found in a ditch
by the road."

314
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:03,747
Honey, I didn't wait for you.
You must be hungry.

315
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:08,418
- There's some pasta, it's cold...
- That's fine.

316
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:10,796
You already showered ?

317
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:17,553
I went to see Martini,
we did another ultrasound.

318
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:22,933
- And everything's good.
- Great.

319
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:27,312
I just need to rest,
so I start maternity leave tomorrow.

320
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:30,649
- Perfect !
- Aren't they lovely ?

321
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:32,568
Yes, so lovely.

322
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,697
Did you see Serena at Massimiliano's ?

323
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:45,205
- Great...
- Great, what '? Did you see her ?

324
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:49,668
Who, Serena ?
No, I didn't see her.

325
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:53,088
- Why ?
- She didn't come home last night.

326
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:57,551
She didn't drive my car home
so I had to take a cab today.

327
00:27:57,593 --> 00:27:59,803
You did good.

328
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:12,357
- Are you okay ?
- I'm just peachy.

329
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:14,610
Can I use your glass ?

330
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,198
The keys.

331
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:27,623
What's going on ?

332
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,001
- Why ?
- Dunno...

333
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:40,636
- Sweetie, are you all right ?
- Not now, dad.

334
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:45,140
You should let me know
when you stay over Massimiliano's.

335
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:48,644
- Just a phone call, is it that hard ?
- By the way...

336
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:53,649
- His morn told me to tell you...
- Tell me what ?

337
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,109
- To call her.
- I'm going there now.

338
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:59,363
- Want me to drive you ?
- No, I'll take my scooter.

339
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,531
Your dad gets worried...

340
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:06,495
I have a feeling
she and Massimiliano had a fight.

341
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,497
"Allied Property,
how can I help you ?"

342
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,916
Dearest Ester, it's <i>me...</i>

343
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:13,543
"Hello !"

344
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:16,546
I figured I would come in and see

345
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:20,676
what those rascals at Allied Property
have to say.

346
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:23,929
- Just... out of curiosity.
- "Good."

347
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:27,057
- Right ?
- "I'm glad to hear that".

348
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,518
- "Shall I book an appointment".
- Listen...

349
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,938
Hope they're not just looking
for my contacts

350
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:36,900
and want to send me out waiting
for clients like I did 2O years ago

351
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:40,529
because that wouldn't be suitable.

352
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:44,157
"No... if you're available
next week we could...

353
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:48,829
- ls Miss Serena Ossola at home '?
- What happened '?

354
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,455
- Are you her father ?
- Yes.

355
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:52,457
We need to speak to your daughter.

356
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:21,695
CHAPTER <i>2</i>
CARLA

357
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:29,119
- Serena ! Good morning, darling.
- Is Massimiliano inside ?

358
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:32,998
- He has a surprise for you.
- I already know.

359
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,751
- Pretend you don't.
- All right.

360
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,961
- Is that your dad ?
- Yes, but he's leaving.

361
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:39,880
I'd like to meet him.

362
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:44,634
But I'm rushing off,
I have a hectic day ahead of me.

363
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:04,780
- Why did you stop ?
- For your manicure appointment, ma'am.

364
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,032
And you have a Shiatsu
massage at 3:00.

365
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:12,037
Sorry, I changed my mind.
Let's go, please.

366
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:15,999
Where?

367
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:21,004
- I need a pair of shoes,
let's go to Baldoni.. - Yes, ma'am.

368
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:24,383
Actually, let's go to Crozer

369
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:28,303
so I can finally pick the fabric
for the parlor curtains.

370
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,514
- Yes, ma'am.
- Sorry.

371
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:38,438
Or maybe we could go
to Adriana Crosetti's antique shop.

372
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:43,151
She said some new items
from India have just arrived.

373
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:46,947
And I wouldn't want to miss out.

374
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:55,455
Look who's here !

375
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:58,959
- Am I interrupting ?
- What a surprise !

376
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,836
- How are you, darling ?
- Fine.

377
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:05,215
I'm glad you came to visit.
I have some new treasures.

378
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:12,097
I wonder if Giovanni will like it.

379
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:17,477
Could you pull over please ?

380
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,364
Careful, ma'am. It's dangerous.

381
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,492
What's going on here ?

382
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:38,707
The eaves are detaching
and the stucco is crumbling off.

383
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:44,129
But the main problem
is the roof beams inside.

384
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:46,506
- How sad.
- Want to take a look ?

385
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,967
- May I ?
- Come.

386
00:32:55,849 --> 00:33:01,521
Tino Buazzelli debuted here
with an Arthur Miller play.

387
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:07,360
So did Giorgio Strehler
with "The Chioggia Scuffles".

388
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,362
Full-house every night.

389
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:14,659
- Can't it be restored ?
- Many have contacted me...

390
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:19,748
but to turn it into apartments,
a supermarket, or a bank.

391
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:21,541
A bank ?

392
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:25,795
In a civilized country,
the city would get involved to help.

393
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:30,175
I'm outraged.

394
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,928
I'll go turn on the lights

395
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:35,931
and make a quick phone call.

396
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:38,683
Let it be clear,
you're in here at your own risk.

397
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:19,975
- Who gave you this estimate ?
- Too expensive ?

398
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,851
<i>No.</i>

399
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:27,065
The company wasn't exactly planning
on buying a theater...

400
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:34,197
Gerard says we'll get a tax break
if we create a foundation.

401
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,742
I don't understand much
about these things...

402
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:42,205
Do you realize there isn't
one theater in the whole province ?

403
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:46,001
Is that a horrible thing, honey '?

404
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:51,756
- You'd be giving a wonderful gift
to everyone. - Come here.

405
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:59,264
Honey,
I'd gladly give this gift to you,

406
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:03,143
but will you have time
to manage it ?

407
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:07,480
You need to have
a board of directors.

408
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,608
I know, look.

409
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:13,778
I've written down a few names.

410
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:15,905
You' re Carla Bernaschi,

411
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,908
Bertoncelli, Russomanno...

412
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:25,123
Honey, I have no idea
who these people are

413
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:28,543
but if you've chosen them
then I'm sure they're valid.

414
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:33,423
Thanks, Giovanni.

415
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:36,426
Thanks.

416
00:35:43,183 --> 00:35:45,810
Seems like an interesting lineup.

417
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:50,690
Naturally, this is just a proposal
but I think it's essential

418
00:35:50,774 --> 00:35:55,403
to consider the both an audience
that likes the latest trends...

419
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:02,202
That's me.

420
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:07,290
Ugo, I'm in a meeting.

421
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,834
Be good, I'll call you later.

422
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:15,465
The needs of an audience
that likes the latest trends...

423
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:20,470
as well as an audience that prefers
a more traditional repertory.

424
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:23,098
Enough of Pirandello, please !

425
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,559
We should just hand out Valium
at the door.

426
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:30,063
I find it to be a very balanced lineup,

427
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:34,317
it leaves room for us to
present something experimental too.

428
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:38,822
- Indeed. - Rosanna,
still defaming 18th century talents ?

429
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,491
Pirandello is Pirandello, get over it.

430
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,954
Speaking of Maestro Pirandello,

431
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:49,207
I had the honor of shaking his hand

432
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:51,501
in 1934.

433
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:54,879
What exactly do you mean
by "experimental" ?

434
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:59,634
On the draft
I listed a few things like...

435
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:02,262
- ..Soc'letas Raffaella Sanzio...
- Raffaello Sanzio !

436
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:05,014
Their Hamlet is from 1992...

437
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:09,978
Darling, we all read with enthusiasm
your severe critiques in the paper.

438
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:13,523
- Real enthusiasm !
- We're wondering if there's

439
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,526
anything you do like ?
To get an idea...

440
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,279
What do I like,
asks Professor Russomanno ?

441
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,656
Nothing, theater is dead.

442
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:25,034
- Aren't you aware of that ?
- I suppose it is.

443
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,496
Good to know,
since I'm wasting time teaching it.

444
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:30,623
- How about dance theater...
- Excuse me

445
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:35,170
for interrupting you intellectuals...

446
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,297
As a simple man,

447
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,299
I say working people are tired.

448
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:42,802
Tired of complex things
that give them a headache.

449
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:46,431
- True... people are tired.
- We, of the City Council,

450
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:49,434
believe we need to promote
local traditions.

451
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:54,439
Nearby in Valcuvia
there's the Po Valley choir,

452
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:57,525
very talented and I think they deserve
to perform on opening night.

453
00:37:57,567 --> 00:38:00,320
- On the derriere.
- You mean premiere.

454
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:03,198
That's my input,
you're free to do as you wish.

455
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:12,332
Would anybody like
some tea, coffee...

456
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,460
or cookies ?

457
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:18,463
- Thanks.
- Ma'am, well done.

458
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:20,673
Maestro, thanks.

459
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,842
Thanks, miss.

460
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,428
Mr. De Marchis.

461
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:29,974
- Well, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

462
00:38:31,184 --> 00:38:34,437
- What a mess, this won't work.
- Don't worry.

463
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:37,857
- They acted out today
but will soon calm down. - Hope so.

464
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:41,110
I've yet to thank you
for all you're doing.

465
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:44,072
Politeama Theater shouldn't just die.

466
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:49,369
I was thinking about suggesting you
as Artistic Director.

467
00:38:52,622 --> 00:38:54,624
Why are you smiling ?

468
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:59,504
"And when he shall die, take him
and cut him out in little stars

469
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:05,134
and he will make
the face of heaven so fine

470
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:09,013
that all the world
will be in love with night...

471
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:11,724
- I recall your Juliet fondly.
- Oh please, I was just an amateur.

472
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:15,520
There are amateurs, third-rate actors,
and then actors.

473
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:18,648
Sorry to contradict you,
but you're an actress.

474
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:21,276
What do you think
about my theater proposal ?

475
00:39:21,401 --> 00:39:23,903
It's a pity you quit,
you were delightful.

476
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,364
That was a different life,

477
00:39:26,406 --> 00:39:28,908
I'm not even sure it was mine.

478
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:32,412
- See you soon, Professor.
- Goodbye, Carla.

479
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:59,814
Massimiliano...
Remember... tear them up !

480
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:06,696
- Will you come home to change ?
- You two are stressing me out,

481
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:11,451
- it's not the Nobel prize !
- Give me a kiss.

482
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:16,789
- Serena will be at our table,
did you know ? - Yes.

483
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:33,598
- I think it's a shitty idea...
- What?

484
00:40:33,723 --> 00:40:38,811
Inviting him and his wife
to our table... it's a shitty idea !

485
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:42,982
It's important for Massimiliano
to have Serena there.

486
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:45,735
He's just unpleasant,
that's how I see it.

487
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:51,491
I thought you liked him,
you always invite him to play tennis !

488
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,618
"Invited", past tense.

489
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:57,872
I'll be forced to explain
his placement in the fund too...

490
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,250
Yes.

491
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:03,086
Tomorrow at 7:00.

492
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:09,384
No, I go to Milan tonight,
I'll sleep there, if I can sleep.

493
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:13,137
Nothing, nobody knows.
Call you later, bye.

494
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:19,143
- Problems ?
- No, I'll sort it all out.

495
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:25,858
- Hello '?
- "Morning, do you have a second?"

496
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,778
- Sure.
- "I finally found it"

497
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:35,618
I'll give you a few clues: 1968,
midway between cinema and theater...

498
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:41,374
- ..awarded in Venice. - "Our Lady
of the Turks" by Carmelo Bene.

499
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:44,544
Well done !
For the theater project, remember ?

500
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:47,880
Of course,
when can we watch it ?

501
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:50,049
Monday, as usual ?

502
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:55,430
Sure, or even tonight,
later on at my place.

503
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:59,434
I have dinner plans
but I can call you when I'm done and...

504
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:02,562
Are you sure it won't be too late ?

505
00:42:02,687 --> 00:42:05,690
"All right, call me when you're done."

506
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:11,320
- it was the Artistic Director.
- Director of what ?

507
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:13,781
The theater, he's very nice.

508
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:19,328
By the way, we'll have to see
about all that...

509
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:23,708
- See what ? - Gerard says
the restoration can't start now.

510
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:27,295
What ? But everything's set !

511
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:30,673
Carla, at this rate
we might have to sell it.

512
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:32,300
Sell it ?

513
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:36,929
We got an attractive offer
to turn it into apartments.

514
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:39,599
Why didn't you tell me ?

515
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:42,435
I was going to tell you,
and I just did, take it easy.

516
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:46,481
- We need liquid assets.
- Apartments ?

517
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:50,443
We promised De Marchis
it would remain a theater.

518
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:55,198
The contract we signed
didn't include that clause.

519
00:42:56,365 --> 00:43:01,204
Honey, I know it meant a lot to you,
I'm really sorry,

520
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:04,832
but I have no other choice.
Bye, have a good day.

521
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:21,766
NEW POLITEAMA THEATER

522
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:55,883
Mrs. Bernaschi, hello.

523
00:43:55,925 --> 00:43:57,885
- Enjoy !
- Thanks.

524
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:05,268
Carla, what a wonderful
thing you're doing.

525
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,688
We'll be the first
season-ticket holders !

526
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:12,817
My boys planned a party for after,
Massimiliano's coming.

527
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:16,654
Come over, we old folks
will be relegated to the kitchen.

528
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:19,448
Thanks, but Giovanni's
leaving for Milan tonight.

529
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:22,326
I would've loved to,
but I'm exhausted.

530
00:44:22,827 --> 00:44:24,537
Thanks.

531
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:27,582
- Carla, you look fantastic !
- Sorry, I got stuck in traffic.

532
00:44:27,707 --> 00:44:29,417
Mom, it's about time.

533
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:34,463
Good evening !

534
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:41,179
I told you not to invite them.

535
00:44:41,846 --> 00:44:47,935
And now I'm being told it's time
to announce the three finalists:

536
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:57,320
Francesco Alberici from class 5 C.

537
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:05,328
- What a dickhead.
- Massimiliano Bernaschi, 5 A.

538
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:15,338
And lastly, Marie Rose Bertolazzi
from 5 B.

539
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:19,884
The Blackie...

540
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:25,139
The winner
of the 2010 Cottafavi Prize...

541
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:32,855
Marie Rose Bertolazzi!

542
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:38,486
Oh Well...

543
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:51,666
- I need to get going.
- Talk to him.

544
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,672
Hey, bye.

545
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:02,260
Let it go.

546
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:13,813
- Rice with grouper and peas ?
- No, thanks.

547
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:30,329
- Hi, Donato.
- You all right? - Yes.

548
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:34,292
- You look solemn.
- No.

549
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:39,297
It was a rough day,
shall we go watch it ?

550
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:42,466
- Nobody is home ?
- No, come on.

551
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:56,188
"I forgive you."

552
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:59,233
"I forgive you."

553
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:02,945
"I forgive you."

554
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,325
"I forgive you."

555
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,994
"I forgive you."

556
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,371
"I forgive you."

557
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,952
ls someone home ?

558
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:43,212
Wait here.

559
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:01,939
- When did you get back ?
- Shut that fucking light !

560
00:49:01,981 --> 00:49:03,732
Just now.

561
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,610
- Is dad here ?
- No, he's in Milan.

562
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:10,322
- Tell me you didn't drive in the state
you're in ? - Everything's fine.

563
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:13,367
- No, you drank.
- A few beers, don't bust my chops.

564
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:15,870
You threw up.

565
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:19,957
- They called and you didn't fucking answer.
- Did you drive in the state you're in ?

566
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:22,626
Serena gave me a ride in her car.

567
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:25,504
Honey, you must not
play around with alcohol.

568
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:29,508
Did you take drugs too ?

569
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:34,388
- Did he notice anything ?
- No, definitely not.

570
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:41,020
- Is everything okay ?
- Yes, just go.

571
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:42,897
Go on.

572
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:49,904
- Call me tomorrow ?
- Yes.

573
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:58,662
"You have a new voice-mail."

574
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:01,415
"Carla, are you there ?
It's Adriana."

575
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:07,630
"Sorry for calling so late,
but please call me back."

576
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:13,260
"it's about your son. I think it's best
someone come pick him up"

577
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:18,182
"Kids, not on the carpet, goodness !"

578
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,580
Gerard, take them
to the meeting room,

579
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,582
I'll be right in.

580
00:50:58,931 --> 00:51:01,934
Gerard told you that ?
Quit bullshitting me !

581
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:04,103
I'm fucking fed up !

582
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:07,690
Listen to what ? Give me a break.

583
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,611
Yes, I spoke to dad.

584
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:14,738
You need to grow up

585
00:51:14,822 --> 00:51:18,617
and realize
this regards you too

586
00:51:18,701 --> 00:51:21,245
and that idiot sister of yours,
of ours, all right?

587
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:23,706
I can't handle it all alone !

588
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:29,253
You expect me to listen to your shit
while everything is collapsing ?

589
00:51:29,378 --> 00:51:33,215
Don't say you're busy
or you'll make me see red !

590
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:36,010
You never have shit to do, never !

591
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,387
What does your sister do ?
Yoga ? In India ?

592
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:43,767
But when she's in Milan
she wants a posh apartment.

593
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:45,894
Go to hell, just go to tell !

594
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:53,235
You're back early ?

595
00:51:55,404 --> 00:51:59,408
Sorry Carla,
there was a change of plans.

596
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:01,619
What's going on ?

597
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:06,790
Nothing,
Milan was full of pesky reporters.

598
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:09,418
We came here
so we could have some peace.

599
00:52:09,501 --> 00:52:11,503
What time is it ?

600
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:15,633
I have a meeting now, I'm not
to be disturbed for the next two hours.

601
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:19,011
Tell the staff to not disturb us.

602
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:23,307
- What's going on ?
- What's going on...

603
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,684
It's hard to explain right now.

604
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:29,938
Don't worry, I will handle it all...

605
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:34,568
All right, I'll handle it all,
it's all under control...

606
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:38,656
Don't ask questions,
you can't understand anyway.

607
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:41,950
You're too stupid, Carla,
too dumb !

608
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:58,592
The spreads are all wrong.

609
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:04,098
So we'll have to start selling things
that we don't want to sell,

610
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:07,101
but we're running out of capital
so the only...

611
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:14,358
the only way out is to keep investing.

612
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:17,945
Now I have to go convince
those men in there

613
00:53:17,986 --> 00:53:19,863
otherwise, I'm done for,

614
00:53:21,115 --> 00:53:23,117
I'm finished.

615
00:53:25,244 --> 00:53:27,204
Finished ?

616
00:53:28,497 --> 00:53:30,624
Should I be afraid ?

617
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:36,964
I mean, for us ? For Massimiliano ?
Should we be afraid ?

618
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:52,646
Maybe the three of us can have dinner
and talk about it.

619
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:58,152
- It's good to talk things over...
it brings us closer... - Bye.

620
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:00,904
I have something to tell you too...

621
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:37,775
- Good morning.
- Is your wife okay ?

622
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:40,694
Yes, false alarm.
She just got worked up.

623
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:42,696
- Massimiliano ?
- He's fine.

624
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:45,824
- Can you tell Serena to call me ?
- Okay.

625
00:54:45,908 --> 00:54:47,826
Sorry, gotta run !

626
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:50,037
What's he so cheery about...

627
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,706
Idiot.

628
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:07,179
<i>Donate '?</i>

629
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:16,605
Just let me finish this dialogue.

630
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:20,859
I've been writing all night,
I can't stop !

631
00:55:20,943 --> 00:55:22,861
Thanks to you.

632
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:27,241
I was a coward last night.

633
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:31,870
What ?
You're an amazing women,

634
00:55:31,954 --> 00:55:36,333
- last night was beautiful.
- I had news about the theater.

635
00:55:39,378 --> 00:55:41,630
I had news about the theater.

636
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:44,258
It's not happening,

637
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:47,636
my husband's selling it,
they'll turn it into apartments.

638
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:54,893
I'm sorry, I never imagined things would
take such a turn for the worse.

639
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,895
I see.

640
00:55:56,979 --> 00:55:59,481
But I'm not surprised.

641
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:03,777
I'm sorry for you,
I know it was important to you.

642
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:07,531
As for me, no big deal,

643
00:56:07,656 --> 00:56:10,158
thanks to this,
I was able to meet you.

644
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:13,745
<i>Donate.</i>

645
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:17,291
Let's be realistic,
this just doesn't make sense.

646
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,501
Why not?

647
00:56:20,294 --> 00:56:22,880
And all these months ?
Everything we did together ?

648
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:27,259
I wrote 180 pages of my book
because you inspire me.

649
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:32,890
How can the care and the love
we gave each not make sense ?

650
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:39,438
I brought Carmelo Bene back,
you forgot it.

651
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:43,567
- I truly am sorry, because I also...
- Are you leaving ?

652
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:48,030
Can I say one last thing ?

653
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:50,073
You're an amateur !

654
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:53,535
I thought you were serious last night
but I was wrong.

655
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:57,205
You appear as a walk-on
and when things get dangerous

656
00:56:57,289 --> 00:57:01,335
you run back to your hilltop mansion.
- You're right.

657
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:05,088
You think you never have to face
the consequences

658
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:08,467
because you're still an amateur.
Like when you did theater.

659
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:13,055
It was easier to marry Giovanni
Bernaschi, but he's not enough.

660
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:16,975
So you sleep with this poor idiot !

661
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:20,354
When you realize your betrayal
is a risk, you send me packing.

662
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:23,857
You're just an amateur.

663
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:26,610
Don't you forget, just an amateur !

664
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:30,322
- And a shitty actress.
- Morning, Professor.

665
00:57:30,364 --> 00:57:33,367
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, ma'am.

666
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:45,629
Dai, muoviti! Muoviti, cogliona!

667
00:57:47,339 --> 00:57:49,758
Move it. Go, you asshole !

668
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:52,344
Fuck you, bitch !

669
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:54,513
FUCK you I

670
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:57,391
FUCK you I

671
00:58:09,778 --> 00:58:11,905
Sorry !

672
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:19,371
Sorry, I didn't mean it !

673
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:42,561
Sorry.

674
00:58:51,570 --> 00:58:55,032
- Serena !
- Don't bust her chops too !

675
00:58:56,450 --> 00:59:00,579
- Serena, sweetie. - Sorry,
my dad told me to call you...

676
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:03,582
- Thanks for last night.
- Sure.

677
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:05,834
You drove Massimiliano home ?

678
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:08,837
Yes, sorry Carla, but I have to go.

679
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:14,551
- Want my driver to take you home ?
- No, thanks.

680
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:28,565
- What did you do last night ?
- Fuck off.

681
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:30,192
Massimiliano !

682
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:34,112
Or do you prefer to talk to dad ?

683
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:37,115
He's back ?
- And he's not in a good mood.

684
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:41,745
Look at me.

685
00:59:41,828 --> 00:59:43,955
- Did you drive drunk ?
- Are you deaf ?

686
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:47,501
- I told you Serena drove me.
- Please don't talk that way to me.

687
00:59:48,877 --> 00:59:51,713
- Did your car drive itself?
- Spare me the dumb joke.

688
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:53,590
It wasn't a joke.

689
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:58,762
- Why so uptight ?
- Where were you last night ?

690
00:59:58,887 --> 01:00:02,015
If you were so worried,
why didn't you come get me ?

691
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,017
No, shit !

692
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:08,021
You didn't answer me:
who drove your car home ?

693
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:10,273
- One of the Crosettis.
- Which ?

694
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:12,901
I don't fucking know,
I gave Serena the keys.

695
01:00:13,026 --> 01:00:17,114
Please don't talk that way to me !
Understand ?

696
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:21,785
Tonight, the three of us
will have dinner and talk. Okay ?

697
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:23,662
What a joy !

698
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:30,794
- Who is it ?
- Mrs. Carla,

699
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:33,046
the police is here.

700
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:36,550
- The police ? What ?
- They're outside.

701
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:54,901
So you're not sure
whom Serena gave the keys to ?

702
01:00:54,943 --> 01:01:00,323
- No. - You told your mom Serena
gave them to the Crosetti twins.

703
01:01:00,448 --> 01:01:02,450
Attorney, thanks...

704
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:05,704
- And Serena is your girlfriend ?
- What does that matter ?

705
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:11,168
Maybe she wanted to help you,
life can be strange...

706
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:15,338
A guy told us
he heard about the accident on TV,

707
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:17,340
I think people watch too much TV...

708
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:21,595
He also said he was on that road
around the same time

709
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:24,431
and saw an SUV similar to yours.

710
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:27,475
Not to mention the dent on your car

711
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:34,065
that was sloppily covered up with paint.
- That scratch ? I covered it up.

712
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:37,736
- Really ? - I thought someone
scratched it on purpose.

713
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:51,208
- How much sugar, Detective ?
- Two spoons, thanks.

714
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:53,335
Massimiliano you're a bright kid,

715
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:57,881
if we find out
that you left that party drunk

716
01:01:58,006 --> 01:01:59,841
with your friends,
drove your SUV

717
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:04,846
and ran that poor devil over
but didn't stop to help him,

718
01:02:04,888 --> 01:02:06,765
you'll be in big trouble.

719
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:11,394
- No need to use scare tactics.
- In fact...

720
01:02:11,478 --> 01:02:17,234
- Massimiliano is more than willing
to collaborate. - Collaborate with what ?

721
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:19,653
It wasn't me, understand ?

722
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:25,033
That'll be all for now.

723
01:02:25,784 --> 01:02:28,245
You'll be called in for questioning.

724
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:31,623
We'll impound the car
and check for prints, goodbye.

725
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,418
Goodbye, Detective.

726
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:40,799
Why did it have to be my car
to hit that loser ?

727
01:02:40,924 --> 01:02:43,176
Giovanni!

728
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:46,554
Have you lost your mind ?

729
01:02:47,639 --> 01:02:51,017
Don't you realize
what that idiot has done ?

730
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:56,564
- You can't think he did it!
- Dickhead.

731
01:02:57,565 --> 01:03:00,277
Give me Adriana Crosetti's number.

732
01:03:01,903 --> 01:03:03,655
Under C.

733
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:09,035
<i>Honey ...</i>

734
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:15,834
I didn't run anyone over, I swear.

735
01:03:18,295 --> 01:03:22,090
Alessandro and Fabiano
said they didn't drive your car home.

736
01:03:22,173 --> 01:03:24,592
Then someone else did,
I was in the car with Serena !

737
01:03:24,718 --> 01:03:29,097
What the fuck do you want from me ?

738
01:03:31,558 --> 01:03:35,854
I saw Serena's face today,
she barely looked at <i>me...</i>

739
01:03:37,564 --> 01:03:39,983
Maybe she's trying to cover for you.

740
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:45,238
- That girl loves you...
- Serena doesn't love me.

741
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:48,116
Then why was she here
with you today ?

742
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:52,495
- Why have you been so uptight
since last night ? - Never mind.

743
01:03:52,620 --> 01:03:55,749
- I'm trying to understand.
- I saw you last night.

744
01:03:55,874 --> 01:03:57,834
What ?

745
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,754
I saw you when
I went up to my room.

746
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:04,257
I looked out to see if my car was back

747
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:07,260
and saw you kissing a guy.

748
01:04:07,344 --> 01:04:09,846
Who the fuck is he, mom ?

749
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:16,227
Just Donato Russomanno...
the theater's Artistic Director,

750
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:19,022
I was just talking to him about...

751
01:04:27,739 --> 01:04:30,033
I did a dumb thing, I'm sorry...

752
01:04:36,748 --> 01:04:38,666
Dumb...

753
01:04:45,632 --> 01:04:50,136
In 20 years, you might understand
why these things happen.

754
01:04:51,054 --> 01:04:53,765
You'll think I'm pathetic
but you'll understand.

755
01:05:05,819 --> 01:05:08,571
Sickening...

756
01:05:20,542 --> 01:05:22,460
Why are you here ?

757
01:05:22,544 --> 01:05:26,548
- I came to say sorry.
- Sorry ? Don't bother.

758
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:30,969
Shame on you for blaming my kids
to protect your son !

759
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:34,556
We're just trying to understand...

760
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:38,101
Understand what ?
Never set foot in here again !

761
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:39,811
- Got that ?
- Ma'am...

762
01:05:39,853 --> 01:05:44,983
Never again: you, your husband,
and your rotten drunken son.

763
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:47,110
Let go of me.

764
01:05:47,819 --> 01:05:49,737
Sorry.

765
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:01,499
Then why did you drive him home ?

766
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:04,252
Massimiliano
was in no condition to drive.

767
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:10,091
Whenever he went out at night
you drove him home ?

768
01:06:11,259 --> 01:06:14,387
Yes, it's happened before.

769
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:16,890
- He got into your Fiat.
- Not mine.

770
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:22,020
- Right, your father's wife's,
Dr. Morelli. - Wife...

771
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:26,107
Who drove Massimiliano's car
all the way back home ?

772
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:29,903
His car was blocking others
at the party,

773
01:06:30,028 --> 01:06:34,407
so I took the keys from Massimiliano
and left them there.

774
01:06:35,366 --> 01:06:39,746
- There, where ?
- On the thing... the dashboard.

775
01:06:39,787 --> 01:06:42,040
Your boyfriend...

776
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:47,170
- He's not my boyfriend.
- He claims his car was driven home

777
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:52,050
by one of the Crosettis,
but they swear they didn't go out.

778
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:56,054
I told him that, because I thought
it might've happened.

779
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:57,680
Then who drove the car ?

780
01:06:57,805 --> 01:07:00,517
Did St. Christopher come down
and drive it ?

781
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:14,697
CHAPTER 3
SERENA

782
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:22,413
No worries, I have a "hardcore"
day ahead of me too !

783
01:07:24,207 --> 01:07:27,085
Here is my beast.

784
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:29,212
What do you think ?

785
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:33,216
- Nice... typical asshole car.
- Right ?

786
01:07:33,341 --> 01:07:36,469
Get in, smell the leather seats.

787
01:07:40,098 --> 01:07:42,934
I'm crazy about it.
Listen to her purr.

788
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:48,606
Fantastic ! Shut her off
or we'll both die in here.

789
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:51,067
Not a bad idea...

790
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:53,736
Don't be ridiculous. We agreed...

791
01:07:53,861 --> 01:07:56,614
I can't bear not seeing you.

792
01:07:56,739 --> 01:08:00,326
We'll still see each other,
we're still friends.

793
01:08:00,368 --> 01:08:02,996
My mom will be bummed
when she finds out.

794
01:08:03,121 --> 01:08:05,999
She doesn't need to know.

795
01:08:06,124 --> 01:08:09,877
Right, we don't have to tell anyone,

796
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:13,756
- so you can think it over.
- Stop, I already thought it over.

797
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,883
Maybe you'll be miserable
without me,

798
01:08:15,967 --> 01:08:17,635
you'll miss me.

799
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,846
Let's fuck !

800
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:22,974
- I'll lick your nipples.
- Come on, you're always so violent.

801
01:08:23,016 --> 01:08:24,517
Don't touch me !

802
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:33,401
Isn't that your dad ?

803
01:08:34,402 --> 01:08:36,654
No... what's he doing here ?
He's crazy.

804
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:38,406
Embarrassing !

805
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:41,534
He's my dad's tennis partner now,

806
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:44,537
you can't break up with me anymore !

807
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:04,057
- First time seeing Roberta ?
- I've been seeing her for four years,

808
01:09:04,182 --> 01:09:06,768
every day-

809
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:10,438
You must be as messed up as me.

810
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:17,779
I've never seen you here before...

811
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:32,585
I know it doesn't look much like you...

812
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:35,088
I tend to make things uglier...

813
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:39,967
Take care

814
01:09:41,469 --> 01:09:43,930
What brings you here ?

815
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:47,975
Sorry Roberta, I forgot my keys
and dad's not answering.

816
01:09:48,059 --> 01:09:50,812
I'll give you mine. Come in, honey.

817
01:10:03,491 --> 01:10:05,743
Nice, Luca made it.

818
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:09,872
- Do you know him ? - He's famous...
the kid who got arrested last year

819
01:10:09,997 --> 01:10:13,501
...for dealing at the Art Academy.
- Poor kid wasn't dealing.

820
01:10:13,626 --> 01:10:17,004
- They just found some hash
in his home. - Some ? A pound...

821
01:10:17,088 --> 01:10:19,340
See you at home.

822
01:10:19,382 --> 01:10:21,384
Come here.

823
01:10:23,469 --> 01:10:25,763
Sorry, I'm in high spirits today.

824
01:10:27,265 --> 01:10:30,518
- I love you, bye.
- Okay... bye.

825
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:02,925
Hi!

826
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:06,554
- Remember me ?
- Right, this summer.

827
01:11:08,014 --> 01:11:11,809
- Decorating for Christmas ?
- A bit early because I'm slow.

828
01:11:11,893 --> 01:11:14,562
- I wanted to apologize.
- What for ?

829
01:11:14,645 --> 01:11:17,064
I mistook you for a psycho like me,

830
01:11:17,148 --> 01:11:20,818
- I didn't know Roberta was your mom.
- She's not my mom.

831
01:11:20,902 --> 01:11:22,945
- She's with my dad.
- She's pregnant...

832
01:11:23,029 --> 01:11:25,823
I got assigned to a new boring doctor.

833
01:11:25,907 --> 01:11:30,453
Sorry, I have to go now,
happy painting.

834
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:34,457
Luca, no more bats !
Make something cheery for the holidays.

835
01:11:34,582 --> 01:11:36,334
I think they're cheery,

836
01:11:36,459 --> 01:11:38,211
if this isn't cheery...

837
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:41,047
May Massimiliano
win the Cottafavi Prize !

838
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:45,551
- Easy guys, I'm not going to win.
- Who else would ?

839
01:11:45,593 --> 01:11:47,678
Alberici's a brain
but he's a pansy.

840
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:51,432
Alberici's a pansy,
the other's a Blackie.

841
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:55,978
- Guys, we are truly sickening.
- Yeah, enough.

842
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:05,696
- Look who it is !
- Ambrosini the junkie.

843
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:07,490
Wonder what he's selling.

844
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:10,743
Good stuff, that's for sure.

845
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:16,249
- Serena, hop in.
- No, I'll take my scooter.

846
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:18,501
See you there.

847
01:12:33,391 --> 01:12:36,769
That portrait of me was really crude,
but precise.

848
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:39,730
I hung it in my room,
I look at it every day

849
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:42,108
and remember what a bitch I am.

850
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:44,402
That's all I wanted to say, bye.

851
01:12:46,863 --> 01:12:49,657
Your dad ran off when you were 3
and your mom died.

852
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:51,617
When ?

853
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:53,369
4 years ago.

854
01:12:53,411 --> 01:12:56,622
She was fine, then one day
they found a growth in her lungs

855
01:12:56,664 --> 01:12:59,917
and within 3 weeks
she was gone.

856
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:02,545
I'm sorry,
I lost my morn when I was 11.

857
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:04,881
Your mom died too ?

858
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:08,426
No, she ditched my dad
because he was cheating on her

859
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:11,387
and then ran off
with her high school sweetheart.

860
01:13:11,429 --> 01:13:14,056
Now they live in Romania
where he has a shoe factory.

861
01:13:14,181 --> 01:13:18,019
- Cool. Do you see her much ?
- We talk on my birthday,

862
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:20,813
- memorable conversations.
- I'm sure.

863
01:13:20,897 --> 01:13:24,025
You got lucky with Roberta then.

864
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:26,319
She seems cool.

865
01:13:28,279 --> 01:13:31,574
She's uneasy with me,
I think she's afraid I won't like her.

866
01:13:31,699 --> 01:13:33,784
I like talking to her.

867
01:13:33,826 --> 01:13:35,703
My new doctor

868
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:40,207
makes me talk about
the one problem I don't have...

869
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:43,836
Meaning, the hash
they found in my house wasn't mine.

870
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:48,299
I didn't want to narc out the guy,
I'm not a rat !

871
01:13:48,341 --> 01:13:53,554
- In that case, you're a hero.
- Please, I was scared shitless.

872
01:13:53,596 --> 01:13:57,433
A night in jail was all it took
to convince me to piss in a cup

873
01:13:57,475 --> 01:14:00,561
and go to therapy every week
till I turn 18

874
01:14:00,603 --> 01:14:02,730
I'm almost done.

875
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:11,489
It's probably best
you're not seen with me,

876
01:14:11,614 --> 01:14:14,367
people consider me
a socially dangerous character.

877
01:14:14,492 --> 01:14:17,745
I was in even on the front page
of the local paper.

878
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:19,622
You don't seem dangerous to me.

879
01:14:19,747 --> 01:14:23,584
They'll worry about you
if they see you with me.

880
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:28,881
- Well, then I'll go.
- Good, no more hanging out...

881
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:31,008
- Never seen you before in my life.
- Never !

882
01:14:59,996 --> 01:15:01,789
You're Serena, right ? Hi.

883
01:15:01,872 --> 01:15:04,041
Come here.

884
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:06,919
Luca's told me all about you,
I'm Davide.

885
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:10,131
- You've heard about me ?
- His uncle.

886
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:14,427
Uncle's an understatement, I'm his
sub-dad since Luca never met his.

887
01:15:14,552 --> 01:15:17,680
And a his morn too,
but I'm sure Luca already told you.

888
01:15:17,763 --> 01:15:21,434
- Want coffee ?
- No, thanks.

889
01:15:21,559 --> 01:15:24,562
Luca and I are buddies,
business partners.

890
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:28,065
We have big plans,
has he told you about them ?

891
01:15:28,149 --> 01:15:30,568
About my sister Betta's insurance ?

892
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:33,779
A hefty sum...
We're not some poor losers.

893
01:15:33,821 --> 01:15:39,535
We've been living off the monthly
payouts hat I managed close-fistedly,

894
01:15:39,577 --> 01:15:42,038
but he always had what he needed.

895
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:44,582
Have a seat, take a load off.

896
01:15:54,550 --> 01:15:57,678
And I give him a lift
to the psychologist...

897
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:01,098
I can't fucking stand her !
Did Luca mention that to you ?

898
01:16:01,182 --> 01:16:03,726
She's a ballbreaker.

899
01:16:03,809 --> 01:16:08,564
Luca turns 18 in March, and bye-bye.

900
01:16:08,606 --> 01:16:13,235
- Bye-bye" meaning...
- Meaning: goodbye and good riddance,

901
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:15,571
we'll cash it all in.

902
01:16:18,324 --> 01:16:20,493
- Didn't Luca tell you ?
- No.

903
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:22,620
What do you two fucking talk about ?

904
01:16:22,703 --> 01:16:28,000
I have a good friend in Formentera,
he's like a brother.

905
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:32,129
He proposed we go 50-50
on buying a chiringuito.

906
01:16:32,213 --> 01:16:35,508
Luca and I have just enough money,
it'll be wicked cool.

907
01:16:35,633 --> 01:16:37,718
Right on Playa de Migjorn,

908
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:41,222
- are you familiar with it ?
- No, I've never been there.

909
01:16:42,515 --> 01:16:45,976
You should come visit us then !
Maybe after we've settled.

910
01:16:46,018 --> 01:16:48,479
You'll be our guest,
Luca will be thrilled.

911
01:16:48,521 --> 01:16:52,149
- That'd be nice, thanks.
- My pleasure, go wake him up.

912
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:54,360
He's fucking comatose.

913
01:16:54,401 --> 01:16:59,031
Tell him I'm going out,
I've got a little meeting.

914
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:10,292
What the fuck ?
Didn't you have plans ?

915
01:17:10,376 --> 01:17:13,504
Yes, it's just a quick hello.
I met your uncle.

916
01:17:13,546 --> 01:17:16,132
Jesus, bet he talked your ear off.

917
01:17:16,173 --> 01:17:19,760
No, he's nice ! He said to tell you
he left for a meeting.

918
01:17:19,802 --> 01:17:22,304
Yes, a meeting with a pint at the pub.

919
01:17:22,429 --> 01:17:25,808
The plan about Formentera sound nice,
you never told me.

920
01:17:25,933 --> 01:17:30,813
- I didn't? Oh... - There'll be
no danger of us hanging out.

921
01:17:30,938 --> 01:17:33,691
- What's that ?
- A cool band.

922
01:17:33,816 --> 01:17:35,442
Have a listen,

923
01:17:35,526 --> 01:17:37,903
but first
we'll take a picture together.

924
01:17:37,945 --> 01:17:39,655
- Ready ?
- Yes.

925
01:17:39,697 --> 01:17:42,908
I'll use it for a drawing.
Make a serious face now.

926
01:17:44,827 --> 01:17:47,955
You made a silly face,
we have to take another.

927
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,082
No, I have to go to that damn gala.

928
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:52,459
Can I change in your bathroom ?

929
01:17:52,543 --> 01:17:54,587
Listen to this, you probably know it...

930
01:18:04,096 --> 01:18:06,724
Getting dolled up
like a prep school girl ?

931
01:18:06,807 --> 01:18:08,726
Kind of...

932
01:18:17,484 --> 01:18:19,111
Looking at me ?

933
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:24,325
- I don't want to go to Formentera.
- Why ? it should be beautiful.

934
01:18:25,618 --> 01:18:28,120
- You're beautiful.
- Knock it off.

935
01:18:30,247 --> 01:18:32,333
You're the most beautiful thing
I've ever had.

936
01:18:34,210 --> 01:18:36,003
So are you.

937
01:18:42,092 --> 01:18:44,887
Don't go, don't go to that gala.

938
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:09,536
...Marie Rose Bertolazzi!

939
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:17,878
- Talk to him.
- Okay.

940
01:19:21,674 --> 01:19:23,884
Let it go, Massi. Who gives a shit.

941
01:19:27,554 --> 01:19:30,057
- Rice with grouper and peas ?
- No, thanks.

942
01:19:31,934 --> 01:19:34,937
Come with me
to the Crosettis party tonight.

943
01:19:35,062 --> 01:19:38,190
- I'm going to bed early.
- You're not coming ?

944
01:19:38,274 --> 01:19:41,277
- No way !
- I'm tired.

945
01:19:41,318 --> 01:19:43,946
Fuck you, you're a drag,
acting all high and mighty,

946
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:47,074
who the fuck do you think you are ?

947
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:59,086
It was horrible,
I thought about you the whole time.

948
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:09,722
- Oh God...
- Damn!

949
01:20:11,724 --> 01:20:15,477
Why didn't you take this off ?

950
01:20:15,602 --> 01:20:17,730
I don't want to.

951
01:20:17,813 --> 01:20:20,357
Embarrassed ?

952
01:20:21,984 --> 01:20:25,070
- Aren't you going to answer ?
- Now what ?

953
01:20:26,864 --> 01:20:28,991
Ale, was sleeping,
what do you want ?

954
01:20:29,116 --> 01:20:32,244
- Massi is tanked.
- Why is that my problem ?

955
01:20:34,872 --> 01:20:37,499
Why don't you call his mom ?

956
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:40,252
Fine, what a pain.

957
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:43,464
Sorry, I have to go.

958
01:20:47,343 --> 01:20:50,387
- Because of Massimiliano ?
- I'm so fed up...

959
01:20:52,598 --> 01:20:54,725
I'll come with you.

960
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:00,522
- What the fuck is this ?
- Like it ?

961
01:21:00,606 --> 01:21:02,483
Super cool.

962
01:21:03,734 --> 01:21:05,652
- Do they live here '?
- Yes.

963
01:21:07,488 --> 01:21:09,490
Poor things.

964
01:21:10,115 --> 01:21:12,242
Real poor...

965
01:21:17,998 --> 01:21:19,416
You'd better stay here,

966
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:23,670
Damn, I'd like to see a rich house.

967
01:21:32,012 --> 01:21:34,056
It's a kick-ass party !

968
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:41,814
Where's Massimiliano ?

969
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:44,566
- Drink ?
- Are you nuts ? Where is he ?

970
01:21:44,650 --> 01:21:46,443
In there.

971
01:21:51,073 --> 01:21:53,283
Serena, darling, finally.

972
01:21:53,325 --> 01:21:56,036
I called Carla but she didn't pick up.

973
01:21:56,078 --> 01:21:59,665
He asked for you. He puked
his guts out on my Persian rug

974
01:21:59,706 --> 01:22:02,418
Disgusting !

975
01:22:14,471 --> 01:22:17,808
I'm finally meeting Massimiliano.
What a pleasure.

976
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:21,228
- Put him in the car.
- Don't worry, we'll drive you home.

977
01:22:22,813 --> 01:22:26,108
- We need to move his car first.
- Which ?

978
01:22:26,191 --> 01:22:28,986
- The big one.
- Damn, the SUV! I'll do it.

979
01:22:29,069 --> 01:22:31,113
- Can you drive it ?
- Of course.

980
01:22:42,374 --> 01:22:45,502
- Does he live far ?
- In Ornate. Why ?

981
01:22:45,586 --> 01:22:48,630
- I'll drop it off at his house.
- Are you kidding ? Luca !

982
01:22:54,386 --> 01:22:58,265
My dad can stick
the Cottafavi Prize up his ass.

983
01:22:59,641 --> 01:23:03,520
I'm so glad, I am so glad!

984
01:23:09,651 --> 01:23:12,029
He's an asshole.
I want to be an orphan.

985
01:23:13,780 --> 01:23:16,492
That bastard needs to die.

986
01:23:16,533 --> 01:23:19,411
I want that asshole to die.

987
01:23:22,164 --> 01:23:24,374
Sit up, please.

988
01:23:26,043 --> 01:23:28,295
I hate his finance bullshit.

989
01:23:28,378 --> 01:23:31,507
Have you noticed that my life sucks ?

990
01:23:31,548 --> 01:23:34,176
Have you ?

991
01:23:45,896 --> 01:23:49,399
Only you understand me, Serena.

992
01:24:08,085 --> 01:24:10,337
Come on.

993
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:18,845
Stand up.

994
01:24:22,558 --> 01:24:26,478
Massimiliano,
can you make it to your room ?

995
01:24:26,562 --> 01:24:28,564
I'll try. Give me a kiss.

996
01:24:28,605 --> 01:24:30,983
No way, go !

997
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:40,867
- We did it.
- Wait.

998
01:24:40,951 --> 01:24:43,745
- Did you see that guy ?
- Who ?

999
01:24:43,829 --> 01:24:47,874
He just suddenly appeared
in front of me.

1000
01:24:47,958 --> 01:24:50,961
I tried to swerve but I think
I hit him. He was on a bike.

1001
01:25:07,644 --> 01:25:09,730
Let's leave, help must be on the way.

1002
01:25:09,771 --> 01:25:11,398
I need to see.

1003
01:25:18,530 --> 01:25:21,783
- What happened ?
- He was run over.

1004
01:25:21,867 --> 01:25:25,037
- I think he hit his head.
- They're here.

1005
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:28,415
- Is he dead ?
- No, let's go.

1006
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:30,500
He's dead.

1007
01:25:39,676 --> 01:25:43,180
- I'm screwed, fucking hell !
- Maybe it's not serious.

1008
01:25:51,813 --> 01:25:53,815
Come on.

1009
01:25:54,691 --> 01:25:56,902
Fuck!

1010
01:25:56,943 --> 01:25:58,945
Fuck!

1011
01:26:42,864 --> 01:26:45,075
TRY TO BEHAVE...

1012
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:55,752
Sono qui nella stanza con lui.

1013
01:26:55,877 --> 01:26:59,631
I'm with him, the doctor says
there's nothing they can do.

1014
01:27:00,507 --> 01:27:03,635
He's hemorrhaging too much,
they can't operate now.

1015
01:27:05,387 --> 01:27:09,891
Yes, they're moving him
to a regular patient room.

1016
01:27:11,143 --> 01:27:15,605
No, not the kids.
They shouldn't see him like this.

1017
01:27:15,647 --> 01:27:18,275
They're at grandma's,
I haven't told them anything.

1018
01:27:27,659 --> 01:27:30,746
Michele, thanks for coming !

1019
01:27:36,168 --> 01:27:38,170
The keys.

1020
01:27:39,296 --> 01:27:41,006
Hello to you...

1021
01:27:43,008 --> 01:27:45,427
Pick up, damn it!

1022
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:47,179
Pick up.

1023
01:27:52,517 --> 01:27:55,437
- "Hello ?"
- Are you awake ?

1024
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:58,148
We need to talk, I'm coming over.

1025
01:28:00,066 --> 01:28:02,652
Sweetie,

1026
01:28:02,694 --> 01:28:05,697
- are you all right?
- Not now, dad.

1027
01:28:05,781 --> 01:28:09,951
You should let me know
when you stay over Massimiliano's.

1028
01:28:10,035 --> 01:28:12,454
Just a phone call, is it that hard ?

1029
01:28:12,579 --> 01:28:18,210
- His morn told me to tell you...
- Tell me what? - To call her.

1030
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:45,445
Are you still fucking asleep ?

1031
01:28:46,363 --> 01:28:48,240
Wake up.

1032
01:28:48,365 --> 01:28:51,868
- Open your eyes, look at me.
- I have a killer headache.

1033
01:28:51,952 --> 01:28:55,622
Get drunk all you want

1034
01:28:55,747 --> 01:28:58,375
but leave me out of it,

1035
01:28:58,458 --> 01:29:01,586
- I'm not your girlfriend anymore.
- Why are you so pissed ?

1036
01:29:01,628 --> 01:29:04,005
Don't you remember last night ?

1037
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:06,258
Yes, I'm sorry.

1038
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:08,260
What do you remember ?

1039
01:29:08,385 --> 01:29:10,595
You drove me home, right ?

1040
01:29:11,638 --> 01:29:13,765
My SUV ? Who brought it back ?

1041
01:29:13,849 --> 01:29:17,727
I left the keys on the dashboard
maybe the Crosettis drove it back.

1042
01:29:17,769 --> 01:29:23,358
- You're awesome, come here.
- Quit it. - Sorry.

1043
01:29:24,526 --> 01:29:28,238
- I have to go. - Wait !
I need to talk to you.

1044
01:29:29,531 --> 01:29:35,161
When you found out your mom
was with that other guy...

1045
01:29:35,245 --> 01:29:38,373
- How did you feel ?
- How do you think ?

1046
01:29:39,416 --> 01:29:41,293
Where are you going ?

1047
01:30:03,940 --> 01:30:06,818
- Not answering your phone ?
- I chucked it.

1048
01:30:06,943 --> 01:30:08,653
Why '2

1049
01:30:10,322 --> 01:30:12,157
Massimiliano doesn't know a thing.

1050
01:30:12,198 --> 01:30:16,953
Why did this fucking happen ?
I'll be locked up for life.

1051
01:30:17,078 --> 01:30:20,665
Nobody will know
you were driving, relax.

1052
01:30:21,166 --> 01:30:25,462
I always end up in the shit,
no matter what !

1053
01:30:25,587 --> 01:30:27,797
- Why me '? Fuck !
- Stop.

1054
01:30:27,839 --> 01:30:31,343
- Why me '? Fuck !
- Stop.

1055
01:30:33,219 --> 01:30:37,474
I'm sorry. I'm not mad at you,

1056
01:30:37,599 --> 01:30:40,977
I just don't want to drag you
into my shit.

1057
01:30:41,102 --> 01:30:43,980
- I went to the hospital.
- Why ?

1058
01:30:44,064 --> 01:30:45,690
To see how he was.

1059
01:30:46,858 --> 01:30:51,988
They took him out of ICU.
But you need to stay calm.

1060
01:31:02,082 --> 01:31:04,250
- Is that your daughter ?
- Yes.

1061
01:31:06,878 --> 01:31:10,131
Damn Giampiero,
I told you I'm in a jam.

1062
01:31:10,256 --> 01:31:13,843
I don't have that money now anyway.

1063
01:31:13,885 --> 01:31:16,096
I have bigger issues right now.

1064
01:31:18,014 --> 01:31:19,641
You want to take my house ?

1065
01:31:19,766 --> 01:31:22,894
Take it then and fuck off !

1066
01:31:23,269 --> 01:31:25,230
Sorry.

1067
01:31:29,776 --> 01:31:31,778
Know what I think ?

1068
01:31:31,861 --> 01:31:34,990
Since the SUV was there
when he got back,

1069
01:31:35,031 --> 01:31:37,742
I think Massimiliano drove it home.

1070
01:31:37,784 --> 01:31:40,870
And since you're a good girl
who cares about him,

1071
01:31:40,912 --> 01:31:45,875
and you realize he's in hot water...
you're covering for him.

1072
01:31:45,917 --> 01:31:49,254
I drove Massimiliano home
in Roberta's car.

1073
01:31:52,132 --> 01:31:55,301
Serena, honey...
I'm going to see the judge now.

1074
01:31:55,427 --> 01:32:00,557
I have to keep you here 2 days
till you admit Massimiliano drove.

1075
01:32:01,266 --> 01:32:04,936
Don't force me to be a jerk,
I don't like that.

1076
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:07,564
Keep me here as long as you want,

1077
01:32:08,815 --> 01:32:11,443
I'm not going to say that
because it's not true.

1078
01:32:20,035 --> 01:32:25,331
FINAL CHAPTER

1079
01:32:31,963 --> 01:32:33,965
Mrs. Bernaschi!

1080
01:32:34,674 --> 01:32:37,969
- Hear about the cyclist's death ?
- When '?

1081
01:32:38,094 --> 01:32:42,182
- Last night.
- How is your son reacting ?

1082
01:32:42,223 --> 01:32:45,977
- I'm sorry !
- Tell us about your son.

1083
01:32:49,606 --> 01:32:51,608
I'm sorry !

1084
01:32:58,990 --> 01:33:01,576
- What the fuck ?
- I need to see Luca.

1085
01:33:01,618 --> 01:33:04,079
He told me everything,
just leave him alone.

1086
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:06,456
- The police don't suspect him.
- I'll tell him,

1087
01:33:06,498 --> 01:33:09,125
no one must find out
you know each other.

1088
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:12,003
- Listen up...
- I want him to rest assured.

1089
01:33:12,128 --> 01:33:16,966
Luca's in the shit,
he's screwed if he gets arrested again.

1090
01:33:17,008 --> 01:33:19,219
Go home and keep your mouth shut,

1091
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:21,012
I'll take care of Luca.

1092
01:33:21,096 --> 01:33:24,641
- Like when he got arrested
covering for you ! - What ?

1093
01:33:24,766 --> 01:33:27,018
That pound of hash was yours.

1094
01:33:27,102 --> 01:33:30,730
You convinced him to take the blame
since he's underage.

1095
01:33:31,231 --> 01:33:33,650
- Did Luca tell you this bullshit ?
- You're hurting me.

1096
01:33:35,527 --> 01:33:37,737
No, he's still covering for you.

1097
01:33:37,779 --> 01:33:42,659
Damn straight, I raised him like a son
and I'll save him from this shit.

1098
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:45,036
Right, with the money his mom
left to him !

1099
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:48,998
Watch what you say and do,
I know where you live.

1100
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:51,376
No go home, you little shit. Go !

1101
01:33:51,417 --> 01:33:53,545
Little shit !

1102
01:34:16,401 --> 01:34:18,027
Luca, my love...

1103
01:34:23,408 --> 01:34:27,453
Fuck off, damn Allied Property !

1104
01:34:34,335 --> 01:34:36,963
"Cyclist dead from hit-and-run."

1105
01:34:37,088 --> 01:34:38,548
Son of <i>a...</i>

1106
01:34:38,590 --> 01:34:40,717
Did you see this ?

1107
01:34:43,428 --> 01:34:45,221
Serena, honey ?

1108
01:35:15,001 --> 01:35:19,130
...no need to worry,
the police suspect Massimiliano...

1109
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:24,260
...and I'll never tell anyone
it was you.

1110
01:35:27,013 --> 01:35:29,265
YOURS FOREVER

1111
01:36:02,632 --> 01:36:04,509
Dino Ossola called.

1112
01:36:06,552 --> 01:36:08,888
He wants to make a deal

1113
01:36:08,930 --> 01:36:11,432
that'll supposedly clear Massimiliano.

1114
01:36:14,143 --> 01:36:17,021
- What deal ?
- Dunno, I hung up right away.

1115
01:36:17,063 --> 01:36:18,940
Are you insane ?

1116
01:36:19,065 --> 01:36:21,317
Why didn't you let him explain ?

1117
01:36:21,442 --> 01:36:24,320
I don't want to be in cahoots
with that worm

1118
01:36:24,445 --> 01:36:28,074
to conceal our son's guilt, got it ?

1119
01:36:28,199 --> 01:36:30,576
Let's go in or you'll catch a cold.

1120
01:37:04,736 --> 01:37:10,366
On here is the proof
of who was driving the car that night:

1121
01:37:10,450 --> 01:37:12,118
first and last name.

1122
01:37:14,370 --> 01:37:17,373
If someone else was driving,
the police will find him.

1123
01:37:19,459 --> 01:37:22,754
Well, the police are convinced
Massimiliano did it.

1124
01:37:22,837 --> 01:37:27,967
And only my daughter knows the truth
and she'll never fess up.

1125
01:37:28,468 --> 01:37:31,763
Plus, this guy might vanish.

1126
01:37:37,143 --> 01:37:39,520
What do you want in return ?

1127
01:37:41,898 --> 01:37:43,858
- Nine hunfred...
- What?

1128
01:37:46,027 --> 01:37:47,904
980,000.

1129
01:37:48,029 --> 01:37:52,116
700,000 I invested
plus the 40% return I was promised.

1130
01:37:52,158 --> 01:37:54,494
Seems only fair to me.

1131
01:37:55,536 --> 01:37:57,497
And a kiss.

1132
01:37:59,791 --> 01:38:02,001
- What do you mean, a kiss ?
- A kiss.

1133
01:38:06,881 --> 01:38:09,759
- Do you want it in cash ?
- No!

1134
01:38:09,801 --> 01:38:13,513
Wire it to an account
I just opened in Switzerland.

1135
01:38:13,554 --> 01:38:17,934
As soon as the money comes through,
I'll give this to the police.

1136
01:38:20,186 --> 01:38:22,271
Write down your account number.

1137
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:35,952
Thanks.

1138
01:38:42,667 --> 01:38:45,920
You think I'm coming undone,
don't you ?

1139
01:38:45,962 --> 01:38:49,215
You're wrong,
I've never been better in my life.

1140
01:38:49,298 --> 01:38:52,969
- I don't think anything, just hurry.
- Good, it's best not to think.

1141
01:38:53,094 --> 01:38:54,595
I have better things to do.

1142
01:38:59,934 --> 01:39:01,727
Here.

1143
01:39:06,941 --> 01:39:08,734
And the kiss ?

1144
01:39:12,238 --> 01:39:14,198
No, a real kiss.

1145
01:39:16,492 --> 01:39:18,619
You're a jackass.

1146
01:39:37,513 --> 01:39:41,100
Serena, enough,
you've been in there for <i>2</i> days !

1147
01:39:42,351 --> 01:39:44,395
Don't piss me off, open up.

1148
01:39:47,231 --> 01:39:49,150
- Food.
- I'm not hungry.

1149
01:39:49,275 --> 01:39:53,154
Well, if you change your mind...
I'll leave it here.

1150
01:39:53,237 --> 01:39:56,657
- Tell dad not to bother me.
- He'll be back tomorrow.

1151
01:39:56,741 --> 01:39:59,660
He left, he was jolly and happy...

1152
01:40:00,536 --> 01:40:02,413
I don't understand him anymore.

1153
01:40:02,538 --> 01:40:04,916
Guess I'm a shitty psychologist.

1154
01:40:06,751 --> 01:40:11,672
I know you don't feel like talking,
but I'll tell you what I think anyway.

1155
01:40:11,756 --> 01:40:14,926
If this carries on,
we'll have to hire a lawyer.

1156
01:40:17,803 --> 01:40:21,557
They can't keep hounding you like this.

1157
01:40:24,185 --> 01:40:29,190
If you say that you drove Massimiliano
home, they have to believe you.

1158
01:40:30,691 --> 01:40:33,444
I believe you.

1159
01:40:35,696 --> 01:40:37,448
Understand ?

1160
01:40:43,079 --> 01:40:44,789
I'll leave you alone.

1161
01:40:51,712 --> 01:40:55,716
Don't worry about Massimiliano.

1162
01:40:57,426 --> 01:40:59,345
His parents will defend him.

1163
01:41:03,849 --> 01:41:05,935
It's not about Massimiliano.

1164
01:41:07,728 --> 01:41:11,357
- But Luca.
- Who is Luca?

1165
01:41:14,235 --> 01:41:18,447
You're the only one who knows him.
He's not what everyone thinks he is.

1166
01:41:20,741 --> 01:41:25,371
Luca Ambrosini ?
Yes, he's a great kid, I know.

1167
01:41:27,373 --> 01:41:29,500
What does he have to do with it ?

1168
01:41:40,011 --> 01:41:42,346
Right here, turn left here.

1169
01:41:44,515 --> 01:41:46,517
Relax.

1170
01:41:48,894 --> 01:41:51,022
Oh my God !

1171
01:41:51,147 --> 01:41:53,524
- What is going on ?
- Why are they here ?

1172
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:01,532
- I need to go see.
- Stay here, I'll go.

1173
01:42:02,491 --> 01:42:06,162
It's best they don't see you. I'll go.

1174
01:42:22,303 --> 01:42:26,932
- He wouldn't open up so they
bashed in the door. - Oh my God !

1175
01:43:58,524 --> 01:44:02,903
- Adriana, darling, how are you ?
- Hello, handsome !

1176
01:44:02,987 --> 01:44:05,614
- Carla?
- She'll be right out.

1177
01:44:05,656 --> 01:44:08,909
- You look great.
- Thanks.

1178
01:44:10,494 --> 01:44:15,040
- Matteo, third time's a charm.
- You look run down.

1179
01:44:15,124 --> 01:44:18,002
- Hi, son.
- Hello, dad.

1180
01:44:18,043 --> 01:44:24,633
- Your siblings are here.
- What an honor !

1181
01:44:24,675 --> 01:44:26,635
Your Majesty...

1182
01:44:26,677 --> 01:44:30,431
I even brought our little sister
straight from Goa.

1183
01:44:30,514 --> 01:44:35,060
- But I'm leaving right away.
- Relax, they won't bite you.

1184
01:44:50,951 --> 01:44:53,704
Honey ? Aren't you coming down ?

1185
01:44:54,330 --> 01:44:59,210
Can you keep an eye on catering,
they don't seem up to par.

1186
01:45:01,086 --> 01:45:03,714
Even if you served
your guests dog food

1187
01:45:04,173 --> 01:45:06,717
they would still love you.

1188
01:45:07,927 --> 01:45:11,722
- Look how happy they are !
- Why, should they be sad ?

1189
01:45:11,806 --> 01:45:13,849
Of course not.

1190
01:45:13,933 --> 01:45:16,227
Things are going so well for them.

1191
01:45:17,937 --> 01:45:21,732
You bet on the downfall of this country
and you won.

1192
01:45:22,983 --> 01:45:25,736
"We" won.
You're part of it too, honey.

1193
01:45:27,196 --> 01:45:29,865
My mom and dad are here.

1194
01:45:29,949 --> 01:45:33,327
Even those two morons
have graced us with their presence.

1195
01:45:34,370 --> 01:45:36,247
I'll be right down.

1196
01:45:36,372 --> 01:45:37,998
Thank you.

1197
01:45:38,123 --> 01:45:40,084
You look beautiful.

1198
01:46:29,508 --> 01:46:33,554
Having been convicted of manslaughter
and criminal negligence,

1199
01:46:33,679 --> 01:46:36,682
Luca will complete his sentence
next fall.

1200
01:46:38,684 --> 01:46:41,687
Massimiliano's insurance
company negotiated

1201
01:46:41,770 --> 01:46:45,190
with the family of the victim,
Fabrizio Lupi,

1202
01:46:45,274 --> 01:46:47,818
for a settlement of 218,976 euro.

1203
01:46:49,653 --> 01:46:53,324
Sums like this are calculated
based on specific parameters:

1204
01:46:53,407 --> 01:46:56,660
the person's life expectancy,
earning capacity,

1205
01:46:56,702 --> 01:46:59,079
quantity and quality
of emotional bonds.

1206
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:02,207
Insurance companies call this

1207
01:47:02,291 --> 01:47:08,422
human capital
