1
00:01:58,526 --> 00:02:02,387
Come on England, come on...

2
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:32,417
Come on, lads get
some weight into it!

3
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,338
Come on get stuck in.

4
00:03:10,473 --> 00:03:12,874
Come on. Come on over here.

5
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:23,886
Bloody hell!

6
00:03:23,986 --> 00:03:26,054
He's broke his front teeth.

7
00:03:28,366 --> 00:03:31,434
You won't want to see
no tarts for a week.

8
00:03:59,981 --> 00:04:01,674
How is he?

9
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:03,343
He's just a bit dazed.

10
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,053
He'll be alright though.

11
00:04:05,153 --> 00:04:06,471
It's not to bad.

12
00:04:06,571 --> 00:04:08,805
How do you feel?

13
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:16,271
You ought to charge more rent.

14
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,899
I don't mind telling you Mrs Hammond.

15
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,155
But when I first came here
I thought I'd fallen easy.

16
00:04:24,255 --> 00:04:26,574
I don't want a list
of my shortcomings.

17
00:04:26,674 --> 00:04:29,951
I'm only trying to show you where
you're hurting yourself most.

18
00:04:30,094 --> 00:04:32,789
Can't I talk to you just
for once as a person.

19
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:36,459
If you listen to what I have to say.
I could really put you right.

20
00:04:36,559 --> 00:04:38,878
I wish you wouldn't try
and work me into a fit.

21
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:41,839
I've asked you before to
leave me alone, that way.

22
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:44,257
I can't stand it.

23
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:53,016
How do you feel, Frank?

24
00:04:55,036 --> 00:04:57,937
You won't be able to shoot your
mouth off like you used to...

25
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:00,483
at least not for a few days.

26
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,777
Can you fix me up with a dentist?

27
00:05:02,877 --> 00:05:05,653
I don’t know.
It's Christmas you know, Frank.

28
00:05:05,963 --> 00:05:07,947
I want it tonight.

29
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,617
Well, I... I can try.

30
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,539
Tonight!

31
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,373
Come on, you lot, let's have you out!

32
00:05:30,696 --> 00:05:32,265
How do I look?

33
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:35,892
I've seen worse. Go on, you're dry.

34
00:05:37,703 --> 00:05:40,106
You going to Weaver's
party tonight, Frank?

35
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:41,983
I've been counting on it.

36
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,193
I'd leave well alone if I were you.

37
00:05:44,293 --> 00:05:46,028
Weaver and parties.

38
00:05:46,128 --> 00:05:49,155
I'd get your mouth seen to
first it's more important.

39
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,033
How's your Mrs Hammond?

40
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,744
She's alright.

41
00:05:56,806 --> 00:05:59,540
I bought some presents for her kids.

42
00:05:59,934 --> 00:06:02,168
Bet she won't like it though.

43
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:05,463
She doesn't like me interfering.

44
00:06:09,694 --> 00:06:11,262
Hallo Frank.

45
00:06:11,362 --> 00:06:14,098
- How are you lad?
- Not now Johnson we're in a hurry.

46
00:06:14,198 --> 00:06:16,350
- Oh Mr Weaver.
- Yes George.

47
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,811
- Frank's ready whenever you want him.
- Oh good.

48
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,313
How's it going Frank?

49
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:21,939
I'm alright.

50
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:24,275
Hello Maurice. What are
you coming in the car too.

51
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:28,154
Oh I wouldn't miss seeing Frank in
the chair. I might even get a camera.

52
00:06:31,382 --> 00:06:33,826
You can put your little
doggie in the boot, George.

53
00:06:33,926 --> 00:06:36,160
Right-Oh, Mr Weaver.

54
00:06:40,057 --> 00:06:42,333
What about your little dog, Frank?

55
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,923
Go on in, Dad.

56
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:54,053
That's not very funny.

57
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,771
Let's have a look at you then.

58
00:07:01,871 --> 00:07:04,398
It's not me, old lad it's Frank here.

59
00:07:04,498 --> 00:07:07,688
Right. Come on.
I've a Member's Ticket,

60
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:11,003
that'll be how you traced me.
I haven't seen a match this season.

61
00:07:12,423 --> 00:07:14,824
Sit yourself down.

62
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:30,925
It's a mess.
They'll have to come out.

63
00:07:31,025 --> 00:07:32,510
Six of them.

64
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,387
It's all I can do.

65
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:37,473
Well, hasn't Weaver
arranged to pay you?

66
00:07:37,573 --> 00:07:39,767
Oh, that's not the point,
I'm afraid. He'll need a plate.

67
00:07:39,867 --> 00:07:41,602
What of it?

68
00:07:41,702 --> 00:07:44,272
I can't go making plates for him.
This is a Children's Department.

69
00:07:44,372 --> 00:07:46,399
Well, kids have false teeth.
I know a couple who have.

70
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,751
- Do you?
- All right, you do the pulling,

71
00:07:48,852 --> 00:07:51,362
get your mate to do the plate.
We'll pay, never mind Weaver.

72
00:07:51,462 --> 00:07:54,031
It's no party here,
let's get on with it.

73
00:07:54,131 --> 00:07:56,534
Aye, you see, he's in pain.

74
00:07:56,634 --> 00:07:57,910
It'll be ten guineas.

75
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,704
- Ten guineas?
- Take it or leave it.

76
00:07:59,804 --> 00:08:03,289
Come on, whatever the bloody price.

77
00:08:05,267 --> 00:08:07,128
It'll have to be gas.

78
00:08:07,228 --> 00:08:09,589
Have you eaten recently?

79
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,716
No, not since my dinner.

80
00:08:11,816 --> 00:08:14,135
Well, would you mind waiting outside?

81
00:08:14,235 --> 00:08:16,636
Go on, Maurice.

82
00:08:27,832 --> 00:08:29,899
Right.

83
00:08:30,793 --> 00:08:33,236
Could you put your hands
in your pockets?...

84
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:37,406
That's it.

85
00:08:37,633 --> 00:08:40,118
Sit tight. You'll feel nothing.

86
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:42,453
Breathe deeply.

87
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:44,457
Sit tight.

88
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:47,375
Keep your hands in your pockets.

89
00:08:48,352 --> 00:08:50,294
You'll feel nothing.

90
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:58,179
I've been thinking...

91
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:00,555
why don't we go for a walk?

92
00:09:01,866 --> 00:09:03,975
What on earth for?

93
00:09:07,913 --> 00:09:11,482
What do you want us to go walking
about in the bloody pitch dark for?

94
00:09:12,042 --> 00:09:14,695
Well, I like to talk to
someone when I'm walking.

95
00:09:14,795 --> 00:09:17,822
You know, your problems;
they're sort of...

96
00:09:18,632 --> 00:09:20,908
You've plenty of friends.

97
00:09:23,512 --> 00:09:25,913
Here, look at this funny man.

98
00:09:26,724 --> 00:09:28,958
Here, you play with it.

99
00:09:31,687 --> 00:09:35,423
You must be mad to think I'd
go out there, walking with you.

100
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:40,012
I don't want you poking
your nose into my affairs.

101
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:42,723
You won't find me poking
my nose into yours.

102
00:09:42,823 --> 00:09:45,309
I have some pride left,
if you didn't know.

103
00:09:45,409 --> 00:09:47,603
Don't you want to be happy?

104
00:09:47,703 --> 00:09:49,814
If I'm left alone, I am happy.

105
00:09:49,914 --> 00:09:51,691
I don't need you pushing in.

106
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:53,693
I'm not pushing in!

107
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:56,112
I'm just trying to be friendly.

108
00:09:56,212 --> 00:09:58,118
Well, I'm not going about all
day with a grin over my face

109
00:09:58,219 --> 00:10:01,701
- just to make you think I'm happy.
- I don't mean laughing all the time.

110
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,827
I mean, you just don't look happy.

111
00:10:05,054 --> 00:10:07,373
It's not a... not a question
of laughing all the time...

112
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:09,041
You make me sick!

113
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:12,628
All right, I am sick. I'm bloody
sick of living here, an' all!

114
00:10:12,728 --> 00:10:15,881
Mr Machin,
that's easily settled... don't.

115
00:10:15,981 --> 00:10:19,175
Just stop living here.
We'll be better off without you.

116
00:10:35,251 --> 00:10:37,360
Come on, open up!

117
00:10:37,711 --> 00:10:39,488
- What have you got in there.
- Come on!

118
00:10:39,588 --> 00:10:41,989
Come on, open up, you boss-eyed git!

119
00:10:56,605 --> 00:10:58,382
Oi, you and me.

120
00:10:58,482 --> 00:11:01,133
Catch it, Dad.

121
00:11:03,404 --> 00:11:06,056
Come on, open up!
The Manager's expecting us.

122
00:11:06,156 --> 00:11:07,433
Come on, Jeff.

123
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:08,851
Come on, open up!

124
00:11:08,951 --> 00:11:10,851
Jeff, come on.

125
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:21,195
Excuse me.

126
00:11:21,964 --> 00:11:24,073
I'm with players.

127
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:26,660
I'm with players!

128
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,288
I'm sorry, Mr Johnson,
didn't know it was you. Come on in.

129
00:11:36,437 --> 00:11:39,465
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
comes the big moment of the evening.

130
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:43,093
The winners in tonight's fifty-pounds
Freestyle Dance Contest:

131
00:11:43,193 --> 00:11:46,637
Miss Evie Turner and
Mr John Whittaker.

132
00:11:56,999 --> 00:11:58,602
As you may have noticed,
ladies and gentlemen,

133
00:11:58,703 --> 00:12:01,529
we've just been joined by a
party from another winning team

134
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:05,614
of whom we're all very proud...
our City Rugby League Team!

135
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,958
Come on, the City!

136
00:12:16,393 --> 00:12:19,045
And now, I'm going to ask a
couple of these famous men

137
00:12:19,146 --> 00:12:22,383
to kindly step up here and present
the winners with their prizes.

138
00:12:22,483 --> 00:12:24,635
Len Miller and Maurice Braithwaite!

139
00:12:24,735 --> 00:12:26,846
Come on, Len, come on, Maurice.

140
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:29,348
Just wait 'till I've
finished this half.

141
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:32,016
Come on, Len!

142
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:43,988
Ladies and Gentlemen: Len Miller,
Captain of the City, and Maurice Braithwaite.

143
00:12:44,088 --> 00:12:45,863
How do.

144
00:13:04,066 --> 00:13:06,425
Well, thank you, Len,
thank you, Maurice.

145
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,598
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

146
00:13:10,698 --> 00:13:15,226
it's on with the dance. It's a general
Excuse Me, and may the best man win!

147
00:13:51,155 --> 00:13:52,723
Excuse me.

148
00:13:52,823 --> 00:13:54,682
Got this one.

149
00:13:55,659 --> 00:13:58,185
He just called a general Excuse Me.

150
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:04,233
Do you want a thumping, love?

151
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,945
Aye.

152
00:14:09,214 --> 00:14:11,615
Well, you'd better come
outside and Excuse Me there.

153
00:14:25,272 --> 00:14:26,590
Hold on a minute.

154
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,299
Hold on!

155
00:14:31,195 --> 00:14:33,095
You...

156
00:14:35,616 --> 00:14:38,225
Now, what's it all about, then?

157
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:44,251
I was meaning to ask you.

158
00:15:44,351 --> 00:15:45,836
Well, what's that?

159
00:15:45,936 --> 00:15:47,921
Your name is Johnson, isn't it?

160
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:50,381
Aye, that's right.

161
00:15:51,608 --> 00:15:53,802
You're a scout for the City.

162
00:15:53,902 --> 00:15:56,303
You could say so.

163
00:15:59,408 --> 00:16:01,642
Can you get me a trial?

164
00:16:04,746 --> 00:16:06,564
Aah!

165
00:16:07,207 --> 00:16:10,943
Now, wait! Wait a minute, lad.

166
00:16:29,771 --> 00:16:31,882
Why don't you come and see me play?

167
00:16:31,982 --> 00:16:34,009
I need someone to cheer me.

168
00:16:34,109 --> 00:16:36,053
You can cheer yourself.

169
00:16:36,153 --> 00:16:38,806
You won't catch me up there
freezing to death for an hour.

170
00:16:38,906 --> 00:16:41,350
It's my first game;
a lot depends on it.

171
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:43,642
- You don't have to do it.
- It's a job.

172
00:16:43,911 --> 00:16:46,939
If I play well and they sign me,
I might get three or four hundred quid.

173
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,066
I'm sure they'll give you all that.

174
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:52,026
Well, that's just the sort
of encouragement I need.

175
00:16:53,754 --> 00:16:56,488
Come and see, I'd like you to come.

176
00:16:56,924 --> 00:16:59,910
If I wanted to go
I would; I've said it.

177
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,620
I don't want to.

178
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,830
Wish us luck, then.

179
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,039
All that's coming your way.

180
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:07,376
I don't wish you my luck.

181
00:17:07,476 --> 00:17:09,960
I'll have to make do with
my own, then, won't I?

182
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:34,570
That's it, Frank!

183
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,945
Well done, lad!

184
00:17:42,719 --> 00:17:43,996
What's his name, Wade?

185
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:46,497
Er... Machin. Er, Frank Machin.

186
00:17:47,808 --> 00:17:49,585
Oh, Charles is here.

187
00:17:49,685 --> 00:17:50,961
Hallo, Charles.

188
00:17:51,061 --> 00:17:53,128
- Charles.
- Gerald.

189
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,055
Pass the ball, Gower.

190
00:18:02,155 --> 00:18:04,306
Pass the bloody ball, you nit!

191
00:18:06,702 --> 00:18:08,811
Pass the ball, you git!

192
00:18:11,707 --> 00:18:14,234
Come on, Gower, get after it!

193
00:18:14,334 --> 00:18:16,570
Let's have that bloody
ball in future, you nut!

194
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:18,404
Get stuffed.

195
00:18:41,737 --> 00:18:44,139
Come on, Gower,
get rid of that bloody ball!

196
00:18:44,239 --> 00:18:46,807
- Come on, Gower!
- Pass the ball, man!

197
00:18:55,042 --> 00:18:57,067
Bloody hell!

198
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:00,404
Hey, Gower, what're you
playing at, you bloody frog?

199
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,461
Trainer, trainer!

200
00:19:17,064 --> 00:19:19,298
Come here. What's your name?

201
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:21,176
How do you mean, Ref? I didn't do it.

202
00:19:21,276 --> 00:19:23,679
- I never touched him.
- You can tell that to Rugby League Chairman.

203
00:19:23,779 --> 00:19:26,139
Look, I swear to God,
I never touched him.

204
00:19:26,239 --> 00:19:28,433
Look at my bloody fists,
there's no blood on them!

205
00:19:28,533 --> 00:19:30,227
- Go on, get off! Off!
- Takes some beating...

206
00:19:30,327 --> 00:19:31,770
bloody hell!

207
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,147
He's not fit to be
on a football field.

208
00:19:34,247 --> 00:19:35,814
Aye.

209
00:19:37,834 --> 00:19:40,110
Don't come back here again!

210
00:19:43,298 --> 00:19:45,075
They got the wrong man there.

211
00:19:45,175 --> 00:19:46,910
You think so, Mr Slomer?

212
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:50,120
Of course. It's as plain
as the nose on your face.

213
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,249
That's not what I call football.

214
00:19:52,349 --> 00:19:54,584
It's a rough game, Charles.

215
00:19:54,684 --> 00:19:58,295
Personally, I like to see a man
playing as if he really meant it.

216
00:21:07,674 --> 00:21:09,868
You played a blinder,
Frank! You played a blinder.

217
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:11,328
You enjoyed it?

218
00:21:11,428 --> 00:21:13,622
Come on, lad,
they'll be all over you.

219
00:21:13,722 --> 00:21:15,916
I was sitting right int'
middle of Committee.

220
00:21:16,016 --> 00:21:18,919
Don't get excited, Dad.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

221
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:20,337
What are you having?

222
00:21:20,437 --> 00:21:22,170
I'll have a beer.

223
00:21:23,231 --> 00:21:25,591
Two beers, please.

224
00:21:25,942 --> 00:21:28,387
You won't find them no
different from me, lad.

225
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:32,224
Maybe they won't show it.
Naturally, they... they shot it like me.

226
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:33,642
Allow me.

227
00:21:33,742 --> 00:21:36,435
- What?
- No, allow me. I really do insist.

228
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,687
A double, Bob.

229
00:21:41,124 --> 00:21:42,984
Well, you played a
good game today, Frank.

230
00:21:43,084 --> 00:21:45,237
Aye, he played a blinder.

231
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,614
I wouldn't worry about him,
he's a bit soft.

232
00:21:47,714 --> 00:21:49,533
How'd you like the City?

233
00:21:49,633 --> 00:21:51,368
I'm getting the hang of it.

234
00:21:51,468 --> 00:21:53,744
Yes, I rather gathered that.

235
00:21:54,262 --> 00:21:56,081
Pity about Taffy Gower.

236
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:57,541
What about him?

237
00:21:57,641 --> 00:21:59,835
They've taken him to hospital.

238
00:21:59,935 --> 00:22:02,419
I believe it was a broken nose.

239
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:06,341
You know, for a little fellow
their hooker packs quite a punch.

240
00:22:06,441 --> 00:22:08,717
It's bad luck.

241
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,638
Yes, it is.

242
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:17,017
You haven't signed on here?

243
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,771
No, they haven't made
their minds up yet.

244
00:22:21,331 --> 00:22:24,276
Well, I don't think they'll
find that too difficult...

245
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,318
do you?

246
00:22:28,171 --> 00:22:29,988
Goodbye, Frank.

247
00:22:34,261 --> 00:22:36,370
Who was it?

248
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:38,081
You know, Frank.

249
00:22:38,181 --> 00:22:40,540
Who was it, Dad?

250
00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:44,544
Guess... Go on, have a guess.

251
00:22:45,272 --> 00:22:46,590
Who was it?

252
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:48,091
That's mean, Frank.

253
00:22:48,191 --> 00:22:49,426
That's mean.

254
00:22:49,526 --> 00:22:50,844
Who was it, Dad?

255
00:22:50,944 --> 00:22:52,636
That's mean.

256
00:22:56,449 --> 00:22:59,142
Why did you squeeze
my wrist like that?

257
00:23:00,954 --> 00:23:02,314
I don't know.

258
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:03,690
Why?

259
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,525
Was it Weaver?

260
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:07,486
You hurt me, you know.

261
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:09,611
Just because it was Weaver.

262
00:23:11,172 --> 00:23:13,865
You get far too excited, lad.

263
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:16,535
I thought you knew it was Weaver.

264
00:23:17,345 --> 00:23:19,122
I was surprised,
him talking to me like that.

265
00:23:19,222 --> 00:23:21,416
He must have been impressed.

266
00:23:21,516 --> 00:23:23,625
Do you think there's something?

267
00:23:24,477 --> 00:23:25,919
Aye.

268
00:24:07,937 --> 00:24:09,921
Do you want me to come home with you?

269
00:24:10,774 --> 00:24:14,384
It's no trouble... no trouble to me.

270
00:24:16,071 --> 00:24:17,637
Aye.

271
00:24:18,948 --> 00:24:23,185
Aye. Come if you like. Have some tea.
Mrs Hammond won't mind.

272
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:49,503
Bit of a coincidence,
me knowing her husband.

273
00:24:50,605 --> 00:24:52,089
Yep.

274
00:24:53,066 --> 00:24:56,968
Not that well, mind;
maybe only a year afore he died.

275
00:25:08,123 --> 00:25:11,192
I say, them's not his
boots, are they?

276
00:25:11,292 --> 00:25:13,860
What's she keep 'em for?

277
00:25:14,087 --> 00:25:15,654
I don't know.

278
00:25:21,886 --> 00:25:24,329
How long have you lived here, Frank?

279
00:25:25,014 --> 00:25:27,457
Oh, about five or six months.

280
00:25:29,185 --> 00:25:30,629
She had some kids, didn't she?

281
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:33,380
- Aye.
- How does she manage?

282
00:25:34,315 --> 00:25:35,759
She does all right...

283
00:25:35,859 --> 00:25:37,636
she does all right.

284
00:25:37,736 --> 00:25:39,427
She just...

285
00:25:39,821 --> 00:25:42,472
put up the shutters
and stopped living.

286
00:25:43,992 --> 00:25:46,268
My wife left me ten year ago.

287
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:00,407
Isn't it warm, Mum?

288
00:26:02,177 --> 00:26:03,910
Warm...?

289
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:07,165
You know we can't use
all that coal, Mr Machin.

290
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:09,749
Don't worry, I'll fetch you
a load home from t' pit.

291
00:26:10,977 --> 00:26:13,295
Mr Johnson, this is Mrs Hammond...

292
00:26:13,563 --> 00:26:15,715
Ian, and Lynda.

293
00:26:15,815 --> 00:26:17,634
We haven't much in for tea.

294
00:26:17,734 --> 00:26:19,177
Don't boast about it.

295
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:22,137
Mr Johnson might get
the idea we're poor.

296
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:27,227
You sit down.

297
00:26:27,327 --> 00:26:30,438
All right, there, young love?
Ooh, you're getting very heavy!

298
00:26:30,538 --> 00:26:32,480
I know!

299
00:26:32,874 --> 00:26:34,526
Tell me...

300
00:26:34,626 --> 00:26:36,194
what have you been doing?

301
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:38,238
Been out shopping with me mam.

302
00:26:38,338 --> 00:26:39,989
Have you now.
And where else did you go?

303
00:26:40,089 --> 00:26:42,407
We went to see our dad.

304
00:26:46,554 --> 00:26:48,164
How did the match go?

305
00:26:48,264 --> 00:26:49,541
Did you win?

306
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:52,542
He played a blinder, Missus,
he played a blinder.

307
00:26:53,478 --> 00:26:55,378
Oh. Did he?

308
00:26:55,605 --> 00:26:57,132
And have they signed him on?

309
00:26:57,232 --> 00:26:58,717
Nay, it's not as quick as that.

310
00:26:58,817 --> 00:27:01,970
But after today's match he'll be
able to ask anything he likes.

311
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,763
Isn't that right, Frank?

312
00:27:03,863 --> 00:27:05,807
Frank, isn't that right?

313
00:27:05,907 --> 00:27:07,267
I don't know!

314
00:27:07,367 --> 00:27:09,644
Aye, it won't pay them to
turn you down, you know, lad.

315
00:27:09,744 --> 00:27:11,229
I'm sure they'll give
him it, Mr Johnson.

316
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:13,398
Aye, he'll sail away.

317
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:15,483
He'll sail away.

318
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:17,901
You'll be very pleased.

319
00:27:19,546 --> 00:27:21,740
I'll see you then, Dad.

320
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,574
You don't mind me helping you,
do you, Frank?

321
00:27:26,886 --> 00:27:28,538
Why do you say that?

322
00:27:28,638 --> 00:27:32,707
Well, you know... I, I mean... if I'm in
a position to help, I think it's only right.

323
00:27:32,976 --> 00:27:35,462
Aye... I think it's right.

324
00:27:35,562 --> 00:27:36,671
You don't mind?

325
00:27:36,771 --> 00:27:39,424
No.

326
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:41,634
Don't know what you're talking about!

327
00:27:41,734 --> 00:27:43,470
Oh... well, that's all right, then.

328
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:44,763
I'll see you.

329
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:47,764
You know, any... any time at all.

330
00:27:47,991 --> 00:27:49,933
Aye, see you, Dad.

331
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,155
You play for nothing, then?

332
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:07,243
I get amateur pay... thirty bob.

333
00:28:07,343 --> 00:28:09,369
That's hardly a wage.

334
00:28:09,596 --> 00:28:12,080
Well, they pay you good money
when they sign you on.

335
00:28:21,316 --> 00:28:24,092
The old man treats you like a son.

336
00:28:24,819 --> 00:28:27,722
I... wouldn't say that. I call
him 'Dad' because he's old.

337
00:28:27,822 --> 00:28:29,349
I don't mean that.

338
00:28:29,449 --> 00:28:31,434
- What do you mean?
- The way he treats you.

339
00:28:31,534 --> 00:28:33,311
The way he ogles you.

340
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:35,438
He looks at you like a girl.

341
00:28:35,538 --> 00:28:37,357
Now, don't come with that.

342
00:28:37,457 --> 00:28:39,067
He's interested, that's all.

343
00:28:39,167 --> 00:28:40,401
I'd say excited.

344
00:28:40,501 --> 00:28:42,862
Well, excited, then!
What are you getting on about?

345
00:28:42,962 --> 00:28:45,323
He hasn't got much to get
excited about at his age.

346
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:46,699
He's done a lot for me.

347
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,243
He's never had a job
of work in his life.

348
00:28:48,343 --> 00:28:49,828
How do you know he's never worked?

349
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:51,454
Because I've got eyes.

350
00:28:51,554 --> 00:28:53,248
You just look at his hands.

351
00:28:53,348 --> 00:28:55,874
He's got awful hands,
they're all soft.

352
00:28:57,143 --> 00:28:59,711
What have hands got to do with it?

353
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:04,050
He's got awful hands...
I've got awful hands.

354
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,509
We're not all women.

355
00:29:06,653 --> 00:29:08,845
Well, it's nothing to do with me.

356
00:30:02,375 --> 00:30:04,027
Your husband...

357
00:30:04,127 --> 00:30:07,237
I gather he worked at
Weavers Engineering?

358
00:30:08,172 --> 00:30:10,073
Who told you that?

359
00:30:11,384 --> 00:30:12,619
Johnson.

360
00:30:12,719 --> 00:30:14,994
Said he used to know him.

361
00:30:17,098 --> 00:30:19,416
He must have told you something else.

362
00:30:20,893 --> 00:30:22,544
No.

363
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:30,343
I expect he thought it was very... chivalrous
of you, helping a widow, and all that...

364
00:30:31,237 --> 00:30:34,514
You reckon it's nothing...
to you what people think.

365
00:30:35,533 --> 00:30:37,600
It isn't.

366
00:30:38,494 --> 00:30:41,396
It's bringing Eric's name
into it I don't like.

367
00:30:49,255 --> 00:30:51,573
You see, when Eric died...

368
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,118
well, all my world went out.

369
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,415
He used say he didn't
know why he was living.

370
00:31:02,852 --> 00:31:04,878
He used to say:

371
00:31:05,438 --> 00:31:07,755
'How was I ever made alive?'

372
00:31:10,526 --> 00:31:13,678
When he went like that, I felt
I hadn't been proper to him.

373
00:31:15,865 --> 00:31:18,641
I hadn't made him feel
as if he belonged.

374
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:33,323
I shouldn't be telling
you this, should I?

375
00:31:39,847 --> 00:31:41,958
I... I don't mind.

376
00:31:42,058 --> 00:31:43,917
No...

377
00:31:44,102 --> 00:31:46,961
I mean, you being what you are.

378
00:31:47,188 --> 00:31:51,341
Self-reliant; all that cockiness.

379
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,055
You don't seem worried like Eric was.

380
00:31:57,573 --> 00:31:59,516
I...

381
00:32:01,494 --> 00:32:04,145
I only mentioned it because...

382
00:32:04,872 --> 00:32:07,440
well, because I saw you
polishing them boots.

383
00:32:08,709 --> 00:32:11,027
Is there anything the matter
with me cleaning them?

384
00:32:11,838 --> 00:32:13,614
No...

385
00:32:13,714 --> 00:32:15,867
No... like I said...

386
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:17,825
I don't mind.

387
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:26,936
A thousand pounds.

388
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:31,025
A thousand?

389
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:34,402
That's a very large sum for a
player just entering the game.

390
00:33:35,338 --> 00:33:37,947
I want one thousand down.

391
00:33:39,425 --> 00:33:44,021
Now, look here, Frank... we're not providing
a comprehensive insurance policy.

392
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:46,839
That's a very fair
offer Mr Riley's made.

393
00:33:50,394 --> 00:33:53,463
I want a thousand pounds... down.

394
00:33:55,483 --> 00:33:58,219
Now, look, we're not trying to
put anything over on to you.

395
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:01,940
I wish you'd get that into your head.
But we are representing other people,

396
00:34:02,041 --> 00:34:04,976
we're responsible for investing
their money soundly.

397
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:08,895
I can't change my mind.
I feel I'm worth it.

398
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:13,566
What does Mr Slomer think?

399
00:34:14,543 --> 00:34:18,114
My only surprise is that you're
discussing such a figure at all.

400
00:34:18,214 --> 00:34:20,116
What figure would you suggest?

401
00:34:20,216 --> 00:34:23,661
I'm far from convinced that he's the
kind of player we want, in the first place.

402
00:34:23,761 --> 00:34:26,789
You realise,
as I'm sure Frank does...

403
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:29,540
that we're not the only
club that's interested?

404
00:34:29,684 --> 00:34:33,461
We're not here to worry about other clubs.
We're here to decide whether we want him.

405
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:37,048
Well, you've had my opinion.

406
00:34:38,567 --> 00:34:41,469
Frank, could you wait
outside a minute?

407
00:35:02,383 --> 00:35:04,867
How goes it, Frank?

408
00:35:05,511 --> 00:35:07,705
Have they fixed you up?

409
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:09,832
They're talking about it now.

410
00:35:09,932 --> 00:35:12,293
Let me get you a drink.
Whiskey? Whiskey, Bob.

411
00:35:12,393 --> 00:35:15,128
I'm Phillips, from the City Guardian.

412
00:35:15,438 --> 00:35:17,964
You needn't take it seriously.

413
00:35:19,108 --> 00:35:20,426
Why not?

414
00:35:20,526 --> 00:35:22,678
It's only a game, old sport.
It's all a game...

415
00:35:22,778 --> 00:35:24,595
for Weaver's benefit.

416
00:35:26,073 --> 00:35:28,059
You mean, they act like
that just for Weaver?

417
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:30,853
Well, it's his cash they're
dishing out. His or Slomer's.

418
00:35:30,953 --> 00:35:34,272
If Slomer hates your guts,
Weaver 'll buy you out of spite.

419
00:35:34,707 --> 00:35:36,858
I see you've got a bruise coming.

420
00:35:37,043 --> 00:35:41,195
No, Weaver wouldn't have you up
here just to say ta-ta, you know.

421
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:43,281
Frank.

422
00:35:57,563 --> 00:36:00,673
What do you aim to do,
Frank, if we don't sign you?

423
00:36:01,901 --> 00:36:03,760
Don't know.

424
00:36:03,944 --> 00:36:05,680
Carry on as I am.

425
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:09,432
Can't you change your mind
about splitting the payment?

426
00:36:21,962 --> 00:36:23,614
No.

427
00:36:23,714 --> 00:36:25,533
No, one thousand down.

428
00:36:25,633 --> 00:36:28,493
Well, I'm afraid there's
nothing else for it, then.

429
00:36:28,803 --> 00:36:30,454
You're not going to sign me?

430
00:36:30,554 --> 00:36:31,831
That's it.

431
00:36:31,931 --> 00:36:33,624
We'll have to.

432
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:36,167
Congratulations, Frank.

433
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:42,632
Congratulations, Frank.

434
00:36:44,151 --> 00:36:45,594
Hold it.

435
00:36:45,694 --> 00:36:47,386
That's it.

436
00:36:47,822 --> 00:36:49,849
Well, aren't you going to read it?

437
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:53,351
Aye.

438
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:00,316
Well, don't spend it all at
once now, will you, lad?

439
00:37:06,006 --> 00:37:08,783
Well, Frank, what does
it feel like, lad?

440
00:37:09,051 --> 00:37:10,703
I don't feel much.

441
00:37:10,803 --> 00:37:12,288
It's all a bit quick;

442
00:37:12,388 --> 00:37:15,706
I'm afraid that's my fault. I like
to get these things settled.

443
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:17,918
I suppose you don't mind.

444
00:37:18,018 --> 00:37:19,919
Not now, I don't.

445
00:37:21,689 --> 00:37:23,923
Did you have any other offers?

446
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:27,470
No... at least,
I didn't hear anything.

447
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:30,139
Well, if you do,
you'll know what to say...

448
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:32,141
property of the city.

449
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,229
Best to make sure, Frank.

450
00:37:38,622 --> 00:37:41,484
Fairfax Street...
now, that rings a bell.

451
00:37:41,584 --> 00:37:44,362
Aye. A fellow called Hammond
used to live there.

452
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:46,863
He got killed at your place...

453
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,157
Weaver's.

454
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:52,495
I've digs with his widow.

455
00:37:52,595 --> 00:37:54,747
Hammond.

456
00:37:54,847 --> 00:37:57,041
Yes, Eric Hammond, wasn't it?

457
00:37:57,141 --> 00:37:58,250
Yeah.

458
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:00,001
Well, I remember the funeral.

459
00:38:00,186 --> 00:38:02,004
How'd he get killed?

460
00:38:02,104 --> 00:38:03,756
Quite nasty.

461
00:38:03,856 --> 00:38:05,674
He was working with a lathe.

462
00:38:05,774 --> 00:38:07,593
Very careless.

463
00:38:07,693 --> 00:38:09,512
He was using a hand-file.

464
00:38:09,612 --> 00:38:12,513
It shot off and stuck
half-way through him.

465
00:38:14,074 --> 00:38:17,101
We had half an idea he'd
done it on purpose.

466
00:38:20,706 --> 00:38:22,149
On purpose...

467
00:38:22,249 --> 00:38:23,692
Yes.

468
00:38:23,792 --> 00:38:26,235
Funny way to commit suicide.

469
00:38:27,087 --> 00:38:30,573
She didn't get any compensation.
The case went against her.

470
00:38:31,091 --> 00:38:33,993
We gave her a bit... not much.

471
00:38:35,137 --> 00:38:37,788
End of the street, or the front door?

472
00:38:37,973 --> 00:38:40,835
End of the street will do.

473
00:38:40,935 --> 00:38:42,627
Right.

474
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:54,263
- Good night, Frank.
- Good night, Mr Weaver.

475
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:09,487
Frank! Hey, Frank!

476
00:39:10,422 --> 00:39:12,281
Hi, Dad.

477
00:39:13,008 --> 00:39:15,161
What are you doing down here, then?

478
00:39:15,261 --> 00:39:17,079
Did you sign?
Have they signed you on?

479
00:39:17,179 --> 00:39:18,914
They wouldn't have me, Dad.

480
00:39:19,014 --> 00:39:20,583
They wouldn't have me.

481
00:39:20,683 --> 00:39:22,209
You ought to have seen 'em.

482
00:39:22,309 --> 00:39:24,211
They're round that Weaver like a...

483
00:39:24,311 --> 00:39:26,712
a pack of dogs around a bitch.

484
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:31,801
I told them what to do with
their stinking, filthy bastard money.

485
00:39:32,027 --> 00:39:33,804
You haven't done that?

486
00:39:33,904 --> 00:39:35,888
Aye.

487
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:42,687
You're not crying about it, are you?

488
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:45,439
You're not crying?

489
00:39:47,668 --> 00:39:49,778
So it was all for nothing, eh? Nay...

490
00:39:49,878 --> 00:39:51,821
Hey, Dad.

491
00:39:52,631 --> 00:39:55,366
I was only kidding you about it!

492
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:57,660
I was only kidding.

493
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:00,498
How much do you think it is?

494
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:02,500
You tell me, Frank.

495
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,625
You tell me.

496
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,003
A thousand quid.

497
00:40:07,229 --> 00:40:08,672
Nay!

498
00:40:08,772 --> 00:40:10,007
Aye.

499
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:13,217
- D'you want to see the cheque?
- Aye, could I see it?

500
00:40:17,573 --> 00:40:19,683
You and me, Frank...

501
00:40:19,783 --> 00:40:21,060
that's us.

502
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,479
How much of it do you want, Dad?

503
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:25,523
Oh, no, Frank.

504
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,483
What do you mean, 'oh, no, Frank'?

505
00:40:27,583 --> 00:40:30,319
- Oh, no, Frank, I...
- Now, Dad, listen.

506
00:40:30,419 --> 00:40:34,363
I don't en joy getting kicked about on a
football field for other people's amusement.

507
00:40:34,548 --> 00:40:37,451
I only enjoy it if I've
been paid a lot for it.

508
00:40:37,551 --> 00:40:39,995
Now I want you to share some of this.

509
00:40:40,095 --> 00:40:41,789
No, Frank, I don't want any of it.

510
00:40:41,889 --> 00:40:45,042
All right, then.
I'll send you some of it.

511
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:49,211
No, wait, Frank. I didn't
do it for the money.

512
00:40:58,697 --> 00:41:01,140
That Johnson called earlier on.

513
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:03,227
That friend of yours.

514
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:05,020
I've just seen him.

515
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,856
You mean he's been waiting
all this time? It was hours ago.

516
00:41:07,956 --> 00:41:10,442
He likes to get out and about a bit.

517
00:41:10,542 --> 00:41:12,278
You should have friends your own age.

518
00:41:12,378 --> 00:41:14,153
I have.

519
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:17,823
They've signed me on.

520
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:22,912
Didn't you hear what I said?

521
00:41:23,263 --> 00:41:24,540
Yes.

522
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,874
You'll be pleased.

523
00:41:25,974 --> 00:41:28,584
So will you when you
guess how much it is.

524
00:41:28,727 --> 00:41:30,754
Oh, I don't know anything about it.

525
00:41:30,854 --> 00:41:32,715
Go on, have a guess.

526
00:41:32,815 --> 00:41:35,716
Just guess how much
you think I'm worth.

527
00:41:36,568 --> 00:41:38,262
Three pence?

528
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:40,848
Now, careful, careful...

529
00:41:40,948 --> 00:41:42,766
you made a joke.

530
00:41:42,866 --> 00:41:46,685
You can't go round cracking jokes like that,
you know... you might do yourself an injury.

531
00:41:48,622 --> 00:41:50,649
Well, come on, have a guess.

532
00:41:50,749 --> 00:41:52,566
Come on.

533
00:41:53,085 --> 00:41:54,194
No...

534
00:41:54,294 --> 00:41:56,987
Well, I'd better tell you
since you're so keen.

535
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:00,908
One thousand pounds.

536
00:42:06,306 --> 00:42:07,708
Oh...

537
00:42:07,808 --> 00:42:09,460
you're a great ape.

538
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,128
You don't believe me?

539
00:42:11,228 --> 00:42:13,712
Look, I've got the cheque
here in my pocket.

540
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:18,677
One thousand pounds in
letters and in numbers.

541
00:42:18,777 --> 00:42:21,011
Signed, sealed and delivered,
Frank Machin.

542
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:24,890
They drove me home in their car...
a bloody Bentley!

543
00:42:28,287 --> 00:42:30,312
It's very good.

544
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:37,778
You don't sound very
excited about it.

545
00:42:39,256 --> 00:42:42,366
It's a bit more than I got
when my husband died.

546
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:48,749
Well, isn't that right
bloody handsome of you!

547
00:42:48,849 --> 00:42:50,584
You didn't have to
do anything for it.

548
00:42:50,684 --> 00:42:53,045
You mean I didn't have
to get killed for it!

549
00:42:53,145 --> 00:42:55,005
Some people have life made for them.

550
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:57,965
That's right, Mrs Hammond, and some
people make it for themselves.

551
00:43:06,742 --> 00:43:09,768
It's about time you took that
ton of rock off your shoulders.

552
00:43:10,954 --> 00:43:13,147
And don't wake me in the morning,
I might be dead!

553
00:43:37,022 --> 00:43:38,964
That money...

554
00:43:39,775 --> 00:43:41,592
does it mean you'll be leaving now?

555
00:43:42,736 --> 00:43:44,136
No.

556
00:43:45,447 --> 00:43:47,264
I don't think so.

557
00:44:31,034 --> 00:44:32,186
...keeping herself...

558
00:44:32,286 --> 00:44:33,686
You're done.

559
00:44:34,454 --> 00:44:35,813
...so small

560
00:44:38,834 --> 00:44:40,234
small...

561
00:44:41,336 --> 00:44:45,157
You'd better get him off home. He'll be
all right when he gets in the fresh air.

562
00:44:45,257 --> 00:44:46,867
Get him into bed.

563
00:44:46,967 --> 00:44:50,035
Doesn't understand...
Keeping herself small...

564
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:56,502
Ooh!

565
00:44:56,602 --> 00:44:59,545
Here, come on,
what's the matter, Frank?

566
00:45:00,314 --> 00:45:02,881
She's so... she's so small.

567
00:45:02,983 --> 00:45:06,468
Oh, he's all right...
he's just full of gas, that's all.

568
00:45:07,613 --> 00:45:09,805
Get hold of him...

569
00:45:10,032 --> 00:45:12,850
She's so bloody small...

570
00:45:13,368 --> 00:45:15,477
Are you going to get in, Frank?

571
00:45:17,706 --> 00:45:20,357
She gives me nothing.

572
00:45:21,001 --> 00:45:23,861
She gives me bloody nothing!

573
00:45:43,565 --> 00:45:45,968
'If I were the marrying kind, '

574
00:45:46,068 --> 00:45:48,011
'which thank the Lord I'm not, sir, '

575
00:45:48,111 --> 00:45:52,349
'The kind of man that I would
wed would be a rugby fullback.'

576
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:54,635
'He'd find touch, ' 'I'd find touch, '

577
00:45:54,736 --> 00:45:56,988
- 'We'd both find touch together...'
- Frank.

578
00:45:57,088 --> 00:46:00,272
'We'd be all right in the
middle of the night, find... '

579
00:46:00,832 --> 00:46:02,734
Oh, the patient's awake!

580
00:46:02,834 --> 00:46:06,612
We've heard all your subconscious
what-nots. Haven't we, Mr Weaver?

581
00:46:07,172 --> 00:46:09,199
My carrier...

582
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:11,159
What's he want?

583
00:46:11,259 --> 00:46:12,661
My carrier.

584
00:46:12,761 --> 00:46:14,121
My carrier!

585
00:46:14,221 --> 00:46:15,956
Steady, lad, steady!

586
00:46:16,056 --> 00:46:18,123
Did he have a carrier?

587
00:46:18,433 --> 00:46:20,834
Is this it?

588
00:46:23,772 --> 00:46:25,839
What have you got in there, then?

589
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:28,594
Presents.

590
00:46:28,694 --> 00:46:31,428
- What did you say?
- Presents!

591
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:41,480
Come on.

592
00:46:45,752 --> 00:46:47,487
What do you think of it?

593
00:46:47,587 --> 00:46:49,865
- Have you bought it?
- Aye.

594
00:46:49,965 --> 00:46:52,492
It's a bit of all right, isn't it?

595
00:46:52,592 --> 00:46:54,328
You're not going to leave
that thing there, are you?

596
00:46:54,428 --> 00:46:55,704
Why not?

597
00:46:55,804 --> 00:46:57,873
You won't smile when you
come for a drive in it.

598
00:46:57,973 --> 00:47:00,500
'Ere, he can take you out on Sunday
afternoons now, Mrs Hammond!

599
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,168
Don't worry, you'll never
get me to go in that thing.

600
00:47:06,982 --> 00:47:09,925
It's like riding around
in your own front room!

601
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:13,972
Come on, Ian, let's come for a drive.

602
00:47:14,072 --> 00:47:16,350
Don't mind your mother... come on.

603
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:18,352
Watch your head.

604
00:47:18,452 --> 00:47:20,604
Hey, I want him for his dinner!

605
00:47:20,704 --> 00:47:22,356
Look, he's got to get back to school!

606
00:47:22,456 --> 00:47:26,400
Don't worry, I'll take him
in this. We won't be long.

607
00:47:35,969 --> 00:47:38,245
Frank, lad, we're there.

608
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,027
It's Frank! Frank Machin!

609
00:48:10,879 --> 00:48:12,863
Come on, Frank.

610
00:48:13,298 --> 00:48:16,658
Hurray!

611
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:22,456
Come on, show 'em your smile, Frank.
Come on, smile for them, Frankie! Ha, ha!

612
00:48:28,146 --> 00:48:31,423
You shouldn't be here, lad.
Can I take you home?

613
00:48:31,566 --> 00:48:33,634
I'm all right, Dad.

614
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:37,681
'...He'd push hard, ' 'and I'd push hard, '

615
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:39,766
'We'd both push hard together.'

616
00:48:39,866 --> 00:48:41,643
'And there we'd be in the
middle of the night, '

617
00:48:41,743 --> 00:48:45,687
'pushing hard together.'
'If I were the marrying kind...'

618
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:20,390
You've come, have you, Frank?

619
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:22,100
How are you, then?
All right, darling?

620
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,728
- D'you know where the bathroom is?
- Aye, it's up them stairs, there.

621
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:26,521
'He'd run hard, '

622
00:49:26,621 --> 00:49:29,606
'and I'd run hard, '
'We'd both run hard together...'

623
00:50:04,367 --> 00:50:07,144
Come on, Frank. It's me, Maurice.

624
00:50:08,205 --> 00:50:10,565
I know you're in there,
you daft frog!

625
00:50:10,665 --> 00:50:13,026
What's the matter? Sulking?

626
00:50:13,126 --> 00:50:16,528
Hey, Frank, come on out, will you!

627
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:48,145
How far are we going?

628
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:50,480
I thought we'd make a day of it.

629
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:52,524
Go for a run in the country.

630
00:50:52,624 --> 00:50:54,276
You don't mind, do you?

631
00:50:54,376 --> 00:50:56,027
We can't very well
get out now, can we?

632
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:58,612
We can stop the car and
turn back, if you're so keen.

633
00:51:00,924 --> 00:51:04,910
Look, if it's only for the children's sake,
it's worth it... don't you reckon?

634
00:51:27,993 --> 00:51:30,187
Come on, Ian.

635
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:32,272
That's a good boy.

636
00:51:32,372 --> 00:51:34,149
There's a good lad.

637
00:51:34,249 --> 00:51:36,233
Come on, then.

638
00:51:36,668 --> 00:51:38,652
Come to the next one.

639
00:51:41,923 --> 00:51:44,658
Come on, Ian, you throw, then.

640
00:52:14,247 --> 00:52:16,857
Let's go and play soccer, Lynda.

641
00:52:23,965 --> 00:52:26,241
Now give it to me!

642
00:52:38,897 --> 00:52:41,049
Here, gotcha!

643
00:52:41,149 --> 00:52:42,966
I've got you!

644
00:52:43,818 --> 00:52:46,136
Drop it! Drop it! Drop it!

645
00:52:47,989 --> 00:52:50,557
Round and round and round....

646
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:07,324
Come on, Ian, kick us a goal, then.

647
00:53:09,344 --> 00:53:11,288
Come on Ian, kick us a goal.

648
00:53:11,388 --> 00:53:12,829
Come on, then.

649
00:53:14,933 --> 00:53:17,168
Margaret, catch it!

650
00:53:17,268 --> 00:53:19,212
Oh, I'm no good at catching.

651
00:53:19,312 --> 00:53:21,214
Come on, Lynda. Come on, then.

652
00:53:21,314 --> 00:53:22,424
Catch it.

653
00:53:22,524 --> 00:53:23,633
Frank!

654
00:53:23,733 --> 00:53:24,926
Catch it!

655
00:53:25,026 --> 00:53:27,177
See, it's easy.

656
00:53:28,863 --> 00:53:30,806
Come on, throw us a catch.

657
00:53:32,575 --> 00:53:34,142
Ooh!

658
00:53:34,661 --> 00:53:37,020
Now look who can't catch!

659
00:53:37,831 --> 00:53:39,983
Come on, Ian. Come on, Ian.

660
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:41,401
Come on, Ian.

661
00:53:41,501 --> 00:53:43,945
I'll tell you. Catch this.
Ready? Catch this one.

662
00:53:44,045 --> 00:53:46,154
Wa-ay up in the sky.

663
00:53:48,383 --> 00:53:51,159
THE CHILDREN LAUGH

664
00:53:53,012 --> 00:53:55,330
We've lost the ball!

665
00:53:55,849 --> 00:53:58,083
Frank, take me with you!

666
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:11,263
Lynda!

667
00:54:12,824 --> 00:54:14,641
Lynda.

668
00:54:15,243 --> 00:54:19,229
Lynda, stop waving, you'll have
Mr Machin fall into the water.

669
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:22,941
Oh, give over!

670
00:54:23,168 --> 00:54:25,445
Look, be careful!

671
00:54:25,545 --> 00:54:27,112
Lynda!

672
00:54:30,049 --> 00:54:32,784
Look, be careful, love.

673
00:54:42,604 --> 00:54:44,631
Mam did you see us.

674
00:54:44,731 --> 00:54:46,925
Whatever did you want
to go and do that for?

675
00:54:47,025 --> 00:54:48,426
I just wanted to cool off a bit.

676
00:54:48,526 --> 00:54:49,928
One, two, three...

677
00:54:50,028 --> 00:54:52,097
- Mam, mam, did you see us?
- Yes, I did.

678
00:54:52,197 --> 00:54:54,514
Come on, Ian. I'll change my shoes.

679
00:55:15,803 --> 00:55:18,413
Go on, get it!

680
00:55:25,355 --> 00:55:28,214
He's got done it! Machin!

681
00:56:29,919 --> 00:56:32,070
Come here!

682
00:56:35,383 --> 00:56:38,535
Hey, make a good job of it.

683
00:56:38,636 --> 00:56:40,912
Aye, Mr Wade.

684
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:45,208
Come on, you two fairies,
let's have you out of here.

685
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:48,795
Why don't you come in, Ken, and let's
have a look and see what you've got!

686
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:50,916
I'll come in and show you
what I've got, all right.

687
00:56:51,017 --> 00:56:52,759
Come on, I mean it,
let's have you out.

688
00:56:52,859 --> 00:56:54,636
Hey, have you got any more beer?

689
00:56:54,736 --> 00:56:57,597
Len, come on, let's have
this hosepipe on them.

690
00:56:57,697 --> 00:57:00,765
Let's have some cold water on you!

691
00:57:06,122 --> 00:57:08,942
Watch it, it's freezing,
you daft frog, it's freezing!

692
00:57:09,042 --> 00:57:11,401
Right on that body there!

693
00:57:12,128 --> 00:57:14,362
It's lovely.

694
00:57:14,505 --> 00:57:16,533
Oh, that's lovely!

695
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:18,783
It's beautiful.

696
00:57:19,636 --> 00:57:22,370
It was a good game, you know.
Oh, he's got the makings...

697
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:31,546
Isn't that Frank Machin over there?

698
00:57:32,023 --> 00:57:33,341
Yes, it is, love.

699
00:57:33,441 --> 00:57:34,759
Fond of kids, isn't he?

700
00:57:34,859 --> 00:57:37,510
It's not quite how I pictured him.

701
00:57:38,196 --> 00:57:40,098
Right down the wing, you throw
an over head pass like that...

702
00:57:40,198 --> 00:57:42,932
- Ready, Frank?
- Aye, one moment.

703
00:57:44,369 --> 00:57:46,394
Have you seen Cleopatra?

704
00:57:47,205 --> 00:57:49,190
Well, she looks all right,
doesn't she?

705
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:50,775
Would you like to meet him?

706
00:57:50,875 --> 00:57:52,527
Yes, ask him over.

707
00:57:52,627 --> 00:57:53,987
Frank.

708
00:57:54,087 --> 00:57:56,072
Come over here a moment.

709
00:57:56,172 --> 00:57:57,864
The Emperor calls.

710
00:57:59,592 --> 00:58:02,077
Here, go steady, you bloody nut.

711
00:58:05,348 --> 00:58:08,209
Well done, Frank. Well done, lad.
And how are you feeling?

712
00:58:08,309 --> 00:58:10,003
- Champion.
- Good

713
00:58:10,103 --> 00:58:12,837
I'd like you to meet my wife, Frank.

714
00:58:13,314 --> 00:58:14,757
How do you do.

715
00:58:14,857 --> 00:58:18,761
Frank Machin. You're one of the stalwarts
of the City, according to my husband.

716
00:58:18,861 --> 00:58:20,847
That's a relief.

717
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:24,517
Well, he doesn't seem to
be a very sociable giant.

718
00:58:24,617 --> 00:58:26,227
He's probably shy.

719
00:58:26,327 --> 00:58:29,314
I've asked my husband to introduce us
before, but he's such a slowcoach.

720
00:58:29,414 --> 00:58:32,317
I like meeting his protégés
every now and then.

721
00:58:32,417 --> 00:58:35,153
I think he sometimes keeps
them too much to himself.

722
00:58:35,253 --> 00:58:36,696
All his stars.

723
00:58:36,796 --> 00:58:39,407
We don't have stars in
this game, Mrs Weaver.

724
00:58:39,507 --> 00:58:40,658
That's soccer.

725
00:58:40,758 --> 00:58:42,784
Well, what do you have, then?

726
00:58:43,594 --> 00:58:45,079
People like me.

727
00:58:49,517 --> 00:58:51,502
I've got a thirst;
I think I'll be off.

728
00:58:51,602 --> 00:58:52,754
Glad to have met you.

729
00:58:52,854 --> 00:58:53,796
Goodbye, Machin.

730
00:58:53,896 --> 00:58:54,881
- Goodbye, Frank.
- Goodbye, Frank.

731
00:58:54,981 --> 00:58:56,756
You played a great game.
Now, keep it up, lad.

732
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:04,264
Machin.

733
00:59:05,825 --> 00:59:07,934
You did very well today, young man.

734
00:59:08,453 --> 00:59:09,771
Thank you, Mr Slomer.

735
00:59:09,871 --> 00:59:11,522
Yes, very good try.

736
00:59:11,622 --> 00:59:13,816
Yes, very good indeed. Keep it up.

737
00:59:13,916 --> 00:59:15,775
Thank you, Mr Slomer.

738
00:59:18,045 --> 00:59:19,822
Come on. Watch the door.

739
00:59:19,922 --> 00:59:21,991
Hallo, Frank.

740
00:59:22,091 --> 00:59:24,033
Hi, Dad.

741
00:59:29,682 --> 00:59:32,251
'Walking back to happiness, '

742
00:59:32,351 --> 00:59:34,587
'Oopah, woah, yeah, yeah...'

743
00:59:34,687 --> 00:59:36,673
'Bid farewell to loneliness,

744
00:59:36,773 --> 00:59:39,842
'Oopah, woah, yeah, yeah...'

745
00:59:39,942 --> 00:59:41,803
'I never knew I'd miss you.'

746
00:59:41,903 --> 00:59:45,138
Hey, love... what d'you
wear when it's hot?

747
00:59:45,239 --> 00:59:47,225
Where's your husband gone, fishing?

748
00:59:47,325 --> 00:59:49,686
Aye, he's left his bloody
bait at home, an all!

749
00:59:49,786 --> 00:59:52,063
'Making up for things we said, '

750
00:59:52,163 --> 00:59:53,940
'...Oopah, woah, yeah, yeah...'

751
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:56,900
'And mistakes to which they led...'

752
00:59:58,002 --> 01:00:01,321
Hey, love, show us your personality!

753
01:00:03,674 --> 01:00:06,119
Hey, Maurice, how's that
tart of yours, then?

754
01:00:06,219 --> 01:00:07,995
- Who? Judith?
- Aye.

755
01:00:08,095 --> 01:00:10,747
Does she come across
with the old, er, one-two?

756
01:00:11,015 --> 01:00:12,583
Now, watch it, Frank.

757
01:00:12,683 --> 01:00:15,545
Just be careful whose bloody
coat tail you're pulling.

758
01:00:15,645 --> 01:00:18,131
Oh, Maurice, you know
I love you, don't you?

759
01:00:18,231 --> 01:00:20,757
I'm not your flag to wave
up and down the street!

760
01:00:21,567 --> 01:00:24,761
You need stuffing, Maurice,
you know that, don't you?

761
01:00:24,862 --> 01:00:26,347
Women!

762
01:00:26,447 --> 01:00:27,932
Bloody women!

763
01:00:28,032 --> 01:00:30,101
'Walking back to happiness.'

764
01:00:30,201 --> 01:00:32,353
'Walking back to happiness.'

765
01:00:32,453 --> 01:00:36,814
'Walking back to happiness...'

766
01:00:36,999 --> 01:00:39,442
'...again.'

767
01:00:56,727 --> 01:00:58,463
Oh, here she comes.

768
01:00:58,563 --> 01:01:00,506
Hey, she's brought
her mother with her.

769
01:01:00,606 --> 01:01:01,966
Hallo.

770
01:01:02,066 --> 01:01:03,760
Hallo, love.

771
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:06,387
Er, this is the tart I
was telling you about.

772
01:01:06,487 --> 01:01:08,143
Oh, God, just listen to the
way he talks about me!

773
01:01:08,244 --> 01:01:09,474
I think I'll come back
when you've done.

774
01:01:09,574 --> 01:01:11,267
Aye. You should have come
in a few minutes ago.

775
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:12,727
How do, Judith.

776
01:01:12,827 --> 01:01:14,312
Oh, he has told you my name, then?

777
01:01:14,412 --> 01:01:16,522
That and, er, other things.

778
01:01:16,622 --> 01:01:18,982
Ooh, watch it, Tarzan.

779
01:01:19,876 --> 01:01:22,111
Oh, yeah... this is Pam.

780
01:01:22,211 --> 01:01:23,237
Hallo.

781
01:01:23,337 --> 01:01:24,697
How do you do?

782
01:01:24,797 --> 01:01:26,698
- Hallo, Pam.
- Hallo.

783
01:01:29,176 --> 01:01:31,703
I saw your try this afternoon.

784
01:01:32,305 --> 01:01:34,248
I got a good pass.

785
01:01:34,348 --> 01:01:36,624
Ooh, ain't he modest!

786
01:01:41,606 --> 01:01:44,050
- Would you like a drink?
- Gin and orange.

787
01:01:44,150 --> 01:01:46,302
Gin and orange.

788
01:01:46,402 --> 01:01:48,888
- Judith?
- Gin and tonic, please.

789
01:01:48,988 --> 01:01:50,930
Gin and tonic.

790
01:01:51,365 --> 01:01:53,142
Hey, Keith?

791
01:01:53,242 --> 01:01:56,269
A little service, Keith.
Come on, a little service.

792
01:02:07,006 --> 01:02:10,033
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

793
01:02:10,718 --> 01:02:13,806
are there any volunteers? Is there
anyone at all that can dance,

794
01:02:13,870 --> 01:02:18,699
sing, hum, show their muscles, do a
striptease, fan dance or bubble dance?

795
01:02:20,603 --> 01:02:22,712
Come on, Maurice!

796
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:25,216
Go on, Maurice, do a dance!

797
01:02:25,316 --> 01:02:28,553
I see we have a few of
our City heroes here tonight...

798
01:02:28,653 --> 01:02:31,471
including our old friend,
Frank Machin.

799
01:02:33,282 --> 01:02:35,683
Come on, Frank, give a song.

800
01:02:37,578 --> 01:02:40,063
Come on, Frank.

801
01:02:52,218 --> 01:02:54,369
All right, Frank?

802
01:02:54,512 --> 01:02:56,746
Right.

803
01:02:57,515 --> 01:02:59,709
Right. Pick your mike up.

804
01:03:01,602 --> 01:03:03,129
Right.

805
01:03:05,064 --> 01:03:08,007
'Here, in my heart, '

806
01:03:08,442 --> 01:03:12,595
'I'm alone and so lonely.'

807
01:03:13,614 --> 01:03:16,392
'Here, in my heart, '

808
01:03:16,492 --> 01:03:20,978
'I just yearn for you only.'

809
01:03:21,497 --> 01:03:28,569
'Here in my arms,
I long to hold you, '

810
01:03:29,213 --> 01:03:36,035
'Hold you so near,
ever close to my heart.'

811
01:03:36,345 --> 01:03:38,581
'So, darling...

812
01:03:38,681 --> 01:03:45,253
'...say that you care,
'Take my love...'

813
01:03:45,646 --> 01:03:48,256
'...I give gladly.'

814
01:03:48,774 --> 01:03:53,262
'Surely you know...'

815
01:03:53,362 --> 01:03:58,516
'...I need your love so badly.'

816
01:03:58,868 --> 01:04:01,602
'Here in my heart.'

817
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:07,233
'My love and my all, dear.'

818
01:04:08,419 --> 01:04:12,280
'Here in my arms...

819
01:04:12,882 --> 01:04:20,373
and stay here in my heart.'

820
01:04:50,461 --> 01:04:54,864
Hey, come on, get the door open.
There's not a bloody war on!

821
01:05:02,306 --> 01:05:04,458
I'm sorry I'm late.

822
01:05:04,558 --> 01:05:06,252
It's all right.

823
01:05:06,352 --> 01:05:08,836
Hah, that's all right, then.

824
01:05:10,606 --> 01:05:12,591
You've been drinking.

825
01:05:12,691 --> 01:05:14,343
Aren't you going to
ask me how we got on?

826
01:05:14,443 --> 01:05:16,095
Why, did you play football
until this time, then?

827
01:05:16,195 --> 01:05:17,930
No. I've been out with the lads...

828
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:19,974
you know...

829
01:05:20,074 --> 01:05:21,809
living.

830
01:05:21,909 --> 01:05:23,352
You must have had a hard time.

831
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:25,937
As a matter of fact, we did.

832
01:05:33,963 --> 01:05:35,865
You're drunk.

833
01:05:35,965 --> 01:05:37,825
You've come back here drunk.

834
01:05:37,925 --> 01:05:40,745
That's no bloody crime.

835
01:05:40,845 --> 01:05:44,123
You're not me mother...
me something or other.

836
01:05:44,223 --> 01:05:46,042
What are you getting on about?

837
01:05:46,142 --> 01:05:47,626
Sssh!

838
01:05:47,726 --> 01:05:49,587
I tell you...

839
01:05:49,687 --> 01:05:51,921
I'd like it a lot...

840
01:05:52,106 --> 01:05:56,676
if you'd let me call
you 'Sunshine', Margaret.

841
01:05:56,777 --> 01:05:59,011
'Sunshine'.

842
01:06:06,912 --> 01:06:09,605
'Sunshine...'

843
01:07:04,762 --> 01:07:08,372
Ian! Don't go getting it
all over your clothes!

844
01:07:49,723 --> 01:07:51,208
Lynda?

845
01:07:51,308 --> 01:07:52,793
Yes, Mum?

846
01:07:52,893 --> 01:07:54,295
Where are you, love?

847
01:07:54,395 --> 01:07:55,838
In the kitchen.

848
01:07:55,938 --> 01:07:58,714
Oh, that's all right, then.
I just wondered where you were.

849
01:08:04,697 --> 01:08:07,348
Oh, I... I didn't know you were in.

850
01:08:07,533 --> 01:08:10,101
I was just going to make up the bed.

851
01:08:10,995 --> 01:08:13,397
I'm off to work in half an hour.

852
01:08:13,497 --> 01:08:15,898
I didn't hear you come in.

853
01:08:16,417 --> 01:08:20,653
I never know where I am, what
with the... children on holiday.

854
01:09:30,657 --> 01:09:32,726
No, Frank, no!

855
01:09:32,826 --> 01:09:34,728
It's all right.

856
01:09:34,828 --> 01:09:36,563
Oh, no!

857
01:09:36,663 --> 01:09:38,023
It's all right.

858
01:09:38,123 --> 01:09:39,608
Frank, no!

859
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:41,817
No... Frank!

860
01:09:47,132 --> 01:09:49,074
Mam!

861
01:09:52,054 --> 01:09:54,164
Go away, Lynda.

862
01:09:54,264 --> 01:09:56,208
Go away, Lyn.

863
01:09:56,308 --> 01:09:57,835
What are you doing, Mam?

864
01:09:57,935 --> 01:10:00,045
Go on out to play, Lynda, love.

865
01:10:00,145 --> 01:10:01,755
Mam!

866
01:10:01,855 --> 01:10:03,549
Go away, Lynda.

867
01:10:03,649 --> 01:10:05,466
Go away!

868
01:10:18,872 --> 01:10:20,816
Oh...!

869
01:10:20,916 --> 01:10:23,192
You're a man!

870
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:25,778
You're a bleedin' man!

871
01:12:02,476 --> 01:12:04,877
Aren't you going to say anything?

872
01:12:25,582 --> 01:12:28,277
You made a right bloody muck-up
of that loose forward!

873
01:12:28,377 --> 01:12:30,779
Aye, he won't play
again for six months!

874
01:12:30,879 --> 01:12:32,614
Better watch out you
don't get suspended!

875
01:12:32,714 --> 01:12:35,200
What else could I do...
what else could I do?

876
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:37,619
Look, this big character comes around the
blind side every time there's a scrum.

877
01:12:37,719 --> 01:12:39,204
I just stand in his way,
he's never looking.

878
01:12:39,304 --> 01:12:40,998
'Stand in his way!'

879
01:12:41,098 --> 01:12:44,376
I get me shoulder under his jaw...
booph! He goes down like a child.

880
01:12:44,476 --> 01:12:45,461
He did!

881
01:12:45,561 --> 01:12:47,004
I began to count the times
he came around that scrum.

882
01:12:47,104 --> 01:12:49,756
Fourteen times. I must've
hit every part of his face.

883
01:12:49,856 --> 01:12:53,302
You should have seen him.
Bradshaw, that's the name.

884
01:12:53,402 --> 01:12:56,430
Aye, and the fifteenth time he came
round, they carried him off... flat out.

885
01:12:56,530 --> 01:12:58,474
He bloody were, an' all!

886
01:12:58,574 --> 01:13:00,476
You could hear the
crack all over t' ground.

887
01:13:00,576 --> 01:13:03,187
Aye, it just proves I'm a
good defensive player.

888
01:13:06,039 --> 01:13:07,524
Hello, Charles.

889
01:13:07,624 --> 01:13:09,318
Hello, Frank, how's it going?

890
01:13:09,418 --> 01:13:11,069
Champion, Mr Slomer. Champion.

891
01:13:11,169 --> 01:13:13,238
I hope you're not giving too
many trade secrets away.

892
01:13:13,338 --> 01:13:15,407
Have you changed your mind
about Frank, then, Charles?

893
01:13:15,507 --> 01:13:17,242
Oh, now, steady, John.

894
01:13:17,342 --> 01:13:19,912
When Weaver first signed him,
I thought we were making a mistake.

895
01:13:20,012 --> 01:13:21,955
But I don't mind admitting it...

896
01:13:22,055 --> 01:13:25,918
this big lad gives me as much pleasure on
that football field as anybody can today.

897
01:13:26,018 --> 01:13:29,505
Mind you, it's nothing like the old
days, young man... nothing like.

898
01:13:29,605 --> 01:13:31,882
Oh, no, no, no...'course not.

899
01:13:31,982 --> 01:13:33,008
I hear you...

900
01:13:33,108 --> 01:13:36,637
Hi, Ed. I've noticed my photographs
are getting a bit small lately.

901
01:13:36,737 --> 01:13:38,577
- See to it, will you?
- Now, then, tiger.

902
01:13:38,678 --> 01:13:41,874
And put a bit of a smile on
my face when I'm scoring.

903
01:13:44,453 --> 01:13:46,063
Hi, Maurice.

904
01:13:46,163 --> 01:13:48,273
What's up with you, then?

905
01:13:48,373 --> 01:13:50,484
Nothing, I'm just waiting for Judith.

906
01:13:50,584 --> 01:13:52,401
Cop us two, Jack.

907
01:13:53,587 --> 01:13:56,655
I try and take my pleasures quietly.

908
01:14:00,677 --> 01:14:04,706
When I see those
frogs gathered around, I...

909
01:14:04,806 --> 01:14:07,501
just shoot 'em a line, that's all.

910
01:14:07,601 --> 01:14:10,921
Oh, yeah... I brought you your
mail down from the ground.

911
01:14:11,021 --> 01:14:14,048
Half a dozen.
One a week's about my record.

912
01:14:18,445 --> 01:14:22,723
Why don't you bring that... woman of yours
down here some time... that Margaret?

913
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:25,350
She wouldn't come.

914
01:14:27,663 --> 01:14:29,273
Bloody school-kids!

915
01:14:29,373 --> 01:14:31,732
Why wouldn't she come?

916
01:14:32,042 --> 01:14:34,068
She's a home bird.

917
01:14:35,420 --> 01:14:38,574
Are you taking the jam out of somebody's
sandwich without paying for it, then?

918
01:14:38,674 --> 01:14:40,532
Me?

919
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:44,413
No, she's a home bird.
I've just told you.

920
01:14:44,513 --> 01:14:46,538
Now shut up.

921
01:14:46,848 --> 01:14:48,834
Watch out with that tiger,
Maurice, he'll snap your hand off.

922
01:14:48,934 --> 01:14:51,211
Oh, I can take care of him, Ed.

923
01:14:51,311 --> 01:14:53,212
Watch it.

924
01:14:54,815 --> 01:14:56,632
Hey, Maurice.

925
01:14:56,733 --> 01:14:58,385
Maurice.

926
01:14:58,485 --> 01:15:00,095
Have a read of that.

927
01:15:00,195 --> 01:15:02,137
Come on.

928
01:15:04,908 --> 01:15:08,103
'Dear Frank Machin,
enjoyed watching you play'...

929
01:15:08,203 --> 01:15:10,397
rare times I watch the game.

930
01:15:10,497 --> 01:15:12,606
Forgive me if...

931
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:16,278
Perhaps you could drop by for
a drink sometime this week.

932
01:15:16,378 --> 01:15:19,738
Wednesday afternoon might be suitable.
Best wishes, Ann Weaver.'

933
01:15:20,340 --> 01:15:22,491
Ann Weaver?

934
01:15:23,218 --> 01:15:25,452
You're not going, are you?

935
01:15:25,971 --> 01:15:27,871
Read the P.S.

936
01:15:29,141 --> 01:15:32,586
'P.S. This doesn't mean bring
any of your rowdy team mates.'

937
01:15:32,686 --> 01:15:34,379
Is that meant to be a
joke or something?

938
01:15:34,479 --> 01:15:36,089
You're not taking
it seriously, are you?

939
01:15:36,189 --> 01:15:37,716
Why not? I've got nothing to lose.

940
01:15:37,816 --> 01:15:39,301
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

941
01:15:39,401 --> 01:15:41,219
She just thinks I'm
good-looking, that's all.

942
01:15:41,319 --> 01:15:44,138
- Give us a kiss, will you?
- Don't come with that, Maurice.

943
01:15:49,745 --> 01:15:52,105
Careful, Tarzan!
What're you doing to him?

944
01:15:52,205 --> 01:15:54,608
Come on, I want some
husband left, you know!

945
01:15:54,708 --> 01:15:57,152
How d'you mean, 'husband'?

946
01:15:57,252 --> 01:15:59,529
Why, hasn't he told you?
We just got engaged.

947
01:15:59,629 --> 01:16:01,822
- Hey, shut up!
- Engaged?

948
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:04,951
No wonder... no wonder
he's been so rough!

949
01:16:05,051 --> 01:16:07,704
Eh, the Lord help you.
Give us a kiss, love.

950
01:16:07,804 --> 01:16:10,749
Congratulations, Maurice. When are they
going to start ringing them bells, then?

951
01:16:10,849 --> 01:16:12,751
- We're planning on Easter.
- Oh-ho!

952
01:16:12,851 --> 01:16:15,253
Well, you'll be laughing again yourself
when it happens to you, Tarzan.

953
01:16:15,353 --> 01:16:17,839
'When it happens to me'?
I'll put up a bigger fight than that.

954
01:16:17,939 --> 01:16:21,800
No, they're never satisfied,
are they, Maurice? Women!

955
01:16:24,154 --> 01:16:26,388
They don't frighten me, Maurice...

956
01:16:26,698 --> 01:16:28,640
they don't frighten me.

957
01:16:58,021 --> 01:16:59,548
Happy Christmas.

958
01:16:59,648 --> 01:17:01,798
Happy Christmas.

959
01:17:02,651 --> 01:17:06,638
Oh, we're having a party on Christmas Eve.
You'll be coming, of course?

960
01:17:06,738 --> 01:17:10,892
We've got a match Christmas Eve; it's a
Saturday. But I could come on afterwards.

961
01:17:10,992 --> 01:17:13,018
Well, see you do, then.

962
01:17:23,213 --> 01:17:27,491
I suppose playing professional football,
you don't need a full-time job?

963
01:17:27,884 --> 01:17:29,953
Not unless you're
interested in the money.

964
01:17:30,053 --> 01:17:31,621
Are you, Frank?

965
01:17:31,721 --> 01:17:33,874
I like to put it to good uses.

966
01:17:33,974 --> 01:17:36,084
Like what, for example?

967
01:17:36,184 --> 01:17:38,835
Well, like helping people out,
things like that.

968
01:17:39,563 --> 01:17:42,047
Is that why you bought
such a big car?

969
01:17:44,401 --> 01:17:46,845
I must say,
you've been very successful.

970
01:17:46,945 --> 01:17:51,598
Well, it's like this, Mrs. Weaver: you see
something and you go out and you get it.

971
01:17:52,450 --> 01:17:54,144
It's as simple as that.

972
01:17:54,244 --> 01:17:56,728
You make it sound very simple.

973
01:18:08,258 --> 01:18:10,826
Do you like gardens?

974
01:18:11,219 --> 01:18:12,788
No.

975
01:18:12,888 --> 01:18:15,205
Oh, Frank.

976
01:18:35,243 --> 01:18:37,145
Have another drink.

977
01:18:37,245 --> 01:18:39,438
Help yourself.

978
01:18:43,084 --> 01:18:45,529
You're not playing football
this afternoon, are you?

979
01:18:45,629 --> 01:18:47,404
No.

980
01:18:48,006 --> 01:18:51,491
I like you. You're like a big cat.

981
01:18:54,638 --> 01:18:58,500
You're always moving. I've never
seen anyone so restless.

982
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,709
Come and sit down.

983
01:19:04,272 --> 01:19:06,341
I'm not so sure I should be here.

984
01:19:06,441 --> 01:19:10,011
Oh, Frank, don't take
that silly attitude.

985
01:19:10,111 --> 01:19:12,471
Come and sit down.

986
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:19,521
Nothing's happened
to upset you, has it?

987
01:19:19,621 --> 01:19:21,523
No, nothing.

988
01:19:21,623 --> 01:19:24,441
There's no need to feel awkward.

989
01:19:37,389 --> 01:19:38,665
I don't know...

990
01:19:38,765 --> 01:19:41,083
Don't talk.

991
01:19:43,645 --> 01:19:45,171
I think I ought to go.

992
01:19:45,271 --> 01:19:46,923
Oh, why?

993
01:19:47,023 --> 01:19:49,925
I thought you were
behaving so nicely.

994
01:19:52,028 --> 01:19:53,805
I don't think it's fair.

995
01:19:53,905 --> 01:19:55,889
Oh, 'fair'!

996
01:20:00,954 --> 01:20:04,107
You're not feeling... you know...
out of your depth?

997
01:20:04,207 --> 01:20:06,067
I might be.

998
01:20:06,167 --> 01:20:09,694
Well, there's no need,
you can see it...

999
01:20:12,590 --> 01:20:15,200
It's not Mrs Hammond, is it?

1000
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:18,872
Mrs Hammond?

1001
01:20:18,972 --> 01:20:20,997
The woman you live with.

1002
01:20:21,516 --> 01:20:23,458
I lodge there.

1003
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:25,712
Whatever way you
like to put it. Is it her?

1004
01:20:25,812 --> 01:20:29,214
I've been thinking about Mr Weaver.

1005
01:20:31,151 --> 01:20:33,009
Oh, I see.

1006
01:20:33,486 --> 01:20:35,680
I think I'll go.

1007
01:20:35,780 --> 01:20:37,515
You're going?

1008
01:20:37,615 --> 01:20:39,100
Look, I think that...

1009
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:41,186
There's no need to explain, Frank...

1010
01:20:41,286 --> 01:20:43,146
You don't seem to understand...

1011
01:20:43,246 --> 01:20:45,647
Either come in, or go!

1012
01:20:53,173 --> 01:20:56,450
Say it... say it, say it,
say it, say it...

1013
01:20:57,343 --> 01:20:59,286
Say it!

1014
01:21:02,474 --> 01:21:04,584
Why don't you say it?

1015
01:21:04,684 --> 01:21:06,877
Say what?

1016
01:21:10,648 --> 01:21:13,383
Say you've got some feeling for me.

1017
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:17,637
Frank, I can't.

1018
01:21:18,364 --> 01:21:20,432
Not yet.

1019
01:21:20,575 --> 01:21:23,727
But you know me,
and how I've been to you.

1020
01:21:24,162 --> 01:21:26,064
I can't let my feelings go.

1021
01:21:26,164 --> 01:21:27,898
Not again.

1022
01:21:28,124 --> 01:21:30,609
Not to have them cut
off like Eric and...

1023
01:21:30,752 --> 01:21:34,154
everything gone in one person,
and... and dead.

1024
01:21:34,964 --> 01:21:36,825
You've got to give me time, Frank.

1025
01:21:36,925 --> 01:21:39,911
There may not be enough of
us left to enjoy it by that time.

1026
01:21:40,011 --> 01:21:41,788
Oh I don't know...

1027
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:44,541
You might just want to
hear me say it. You...

1028
01:21:44,641 --> 01:21:47,627
You... might feel that's all
you wanted, and go away.

1029
01:21:47,727 --> 01:21:49,713
But you keep fighting me.

1030
01:21:49,813 --> 01:21:51,798
I can't be that bad.

1031
01:21:51,898 --> 01:21:53,633
When are you going
to give us some peace?

1032
01:21:53,733 --> 01:21:55,301
I come upstairs with you, don't I?

1033
01:21:55,401 --> 01:21:58,555
But you make me feel I'm buying it,
I'm just buying, and I'm not!

1034
01:21:58,655 --> 01:22:01,858
Well, that's me. That's how I am.
I've nothing more to give you, Frank.

1035
01:22:01,958 --> 01:22:04,503
- You don't mean that.
- I wish you wouldn't work me up like this,

1036
01:22:04,604 --> 01:22:07,203
telling me how I should feel.
If only you'd leave me alone a bit....

1037
01:22:07,247 --> 01:22:11,149
You're so... big, Frank, you're so stupid.
You don't give me a chance!

1038
01:22:23,388 --> 01:22:31,795
Oh, my God...

1039
01:22:51,124 --> 01:22:53,692
Maurice.

1040
01:23:25,533 --> 01:23:27,767
Mauri...

1041
01:23:28,745 --> 01:23:31,439
Well, Machin. What do you want?

1042
01:23:31,539 --> 01:23:34,899
Hallo, Frank.
Come in, we won't eat you.

1043
01:23:39,631 --> 01:23:43,241
Well, Gerald, aren't you going to
offer a drink to this wild young man?

1044
01:23:45,595 --> 01:23:48,079
A whiskey will do.

1045
01:23:53,853 --> 01:23:56,129
Mrs Weaver.

1046
01:23:56,606 --> 01:23:59,050
They're making a lot
of noise downstairs.

1047
01:23:59,150 --> 01:24:02,677
Last time I open my house to this crowd.
Every scruff in town seems to be here.

1048
01:24:03,738 --> 01:24:06,514
You've been in the wars
this week, young man.

1049
01:24:08,618 --> 01:24:11,062
I'll be all right. I'll be all right.

1050
01:24:11,162 --> 01:24:14,314
He'll have to learn he has to
pay something for his ambition.

1051
01:24:14,415 --> 01:24:17,110
I think it spoils his looks, though.

1052
01:24:17,210 --> 01:24:19,736
Does it hurt, Machin?

1053
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:22,365
No.

1054
01:24:22,465 --> 01:24:24,284
I don't feel anything.

1055
01:24:24,384 --> 01:24:26,119
Take no notice of 'em, lad.

1056
01:24:26,219 --> 01:24:29,079
Mr Slomer's your newest fan.

1057
01:24:29,264 --> 01:24:32,707
You seem to have the kind of
charm that appeals to him.

1058
01:24:33,643 --> 01:24:38,129
I've noticed I'm not the only person who's
found something of interest in Frank.

1059
01:24:38,731 --> 01:24:40,800
What do you mean by that?

1060
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:44,137
Well, Gerald, there was even a time
when you were very impressed by him.

1061
01:24:44,237 --> 01:24:46,181
I carried that boy.

1062
01:24:46,281 --> 01:24:48,390
It was on my back, nobody else's.

1063
01:24:48,866 --> 01:24:51,936
Are you trying to tell me that
you've carried me, or something?

1064
01:24:52,036 --> 01:24:54,854
Yes... from the very beginning.

1065
01:24:55,331 --> 01:24:57,817
I've played myself into
that crumby team.

1066
01:24:57,917 --> 01:25:00,652
But you just don't appreciate how
much help you've had, Frank.

1067
01:25:01,379 --> 01:25:05,615
Look, am I a good
footballer, or am I not?

1068
01:25:05,842 --> 01:25:10,205
The only reason you're in that team now
is because Mr Slomer wants you there.

1069
01:25:10,305 --> 01:25:12,956
Oh, come now, Ann.

1070
01:25:13,683 --> 01:25:16,294
Anyway, I think Frank's
had enough for one day.

1071
01:25:16,394 --> 01:25:19,587
Oh, I see by my onion it's 11:30.

1072
01:25:20,023 --> 01:25:22,133
Time to be going.

1073
01:25:22,233 --> 01:25:24,342
I like to see Christmas in at home.

1074
01:25:26,946 --> 01:25:29,015
Don't bother to come down.

1075
01:25:29,115 --> 01:25:32,016
The young man 'll see that I don't get
into any trouble from your revellers.

1076
01:25:36,581 --> 01:25:38,773
Merry Christmas.

1077
01:25:47,717 --> 01:25:49,244
Tell me, Frank...

1078
01:25:49,344 --> 01:25:54,956
have you been indulging in what I call 'Mrs
Weaver's weakness for social in formalities'?

1079
01:25:55,850 --> 01:25:58,251
Is that your business?

1080
01:25:59,228 --> 01:26:01,504
That's for you to decide.

1081
01:26:04,275 --> 01:26:06,384
No.

1082
01:26:11,324 --> 01:26:13,393
You've been having a good
season so far, Frank.

1083
01:26:13,493 --> 01:26:15,103
- Until today.
- Huh?

1084
01:26:15,203 --> 01:26:17,021
Until today.

1085
01:26:17,121 --> 01:26:18,773
Oh! I see what you mean.

1086
01:26:18,873 --> 01:26:22,068
Still, false teeth can be better looking
than the real thing sometimes.

1087
01:26:22,168 --> 01:26:24,694
What do you think mine are?

1088
01:26:26,672 --> 01:26:28,783
They look very neat.

1089
01:26:28,883 --> 01:26:30,868
Are they false or real?

1090
01:26:30,968 --> 01:26:33,578
False, but they could be real.

1091
01:26:33,888 --> 01:26:35,914
They're false.

1092
01:26:36,849 --> 01:26:39,876
You're in a tricky position
with Weaver, you know.

1093
01:26:41,020 --> 01:26:43,630
I know he hasn't liked me for a bit.

1094
01:26:44,941 --> 01:26:47,634
He thought he had some
sort of ownership over you.

1095
01:26:48,403 --> 01:26:51,137
He just doesn't like
to see it taken away.

1096
01:26:52,115 --> 01:26:53,558
Still...

1097
01:26:53,658 --> 01:26:56,267
you'll be all right as
long as I'm there.

1098
01:26:58,162 --> 01:27:00,396
Do you understand what I mean?

1099
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,821
Aye.

1100
01:27:08,464 --> 01:27:10,365
Right.

1101
01:27:11,050 --> 01:27:14,619
Well... I wish you Merry Christmas.

1102
01:27:16,848 --> 01:27:19,040
Merry Christmas.

1103
01:27:52,133 --> 01:27:54,619
You're Frank Machin, aren't you?

1104
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:57,203
You look different on the field...

1105
01:27:57,346 --> 01:27:59,581
like a tiger.

1106
01:28:13,029 --> 01:28:16,055
You look pale. Aren't you well?

1107
01:28:20,453 --> 01:28:23,062
Am I a good footballer?

1108
01:28:24,749 --> 01:28:28,443
Let's go upstairs and
find an empty room, eh?

1109
01:28:31,214 --> 01:28:34,450
'Oh, he's a jolly good fellow.'

1110
01:28:34,550 --> 01:28:37,368
'For he's a jolly good fellow.'

1111
01:28:37,470 --> 01:28:40,663
'For he's a jolly good fellow...

1112
01:28:41,182 --> 01:28:44,293
and so say all of us.'

1113
01:28:44,393 --> 01:28:48,963
'And so say all of us.'

1114
01:28:49,398 --> 01:28:54,177
'For he's a jolly good fellow.'

1115
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:58,307
'For he's a jolly good fellow

1116
01:28:58,407 --> 01:29:01,060
and so say all of us.'

1117
01:29:01,160 --> 01:29:03,479
'And so say all of us,

1118
01:29:03,579 --> 01:29:05,690
and so say all of us.'

1119
01:29:05,790 --> 01:29:10,818
'For he's a jolly good fellow.'

1120
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:13,404
'For he's a jolly good fellow...'

1121
01:29:14,507 --> 01:29:17,784
'...and so say all of us.'

1122
01:29:18,135 --> 01:29:19,579
Hip, hip!

1123
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:21,330
Hurray!

1124
01:29:21,430 --> 01:29:23,957
Hip, hip! Hurray!

1125
01:29:53,754 --> 01:29:56,072
Weaver...

1126
01:29:56,173 --> 01:29:59,283
you're a fifth-rate gutless quack!

1127
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:09,669
'...He'd kick hard, and I'd kick hard,
we'd all kick hard together...'

1128
01:31:49,161 --> 01:31:51,063
It's late.

1129
01:31:51,163 --> 01:31:53,397
Have you only just got back?

1130
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,151
Frank, are you all right?

1131
01:31:58,587 --> 01:32:00,363
Aye. Aye.

1132
01:32:10,766 --> 01:32:12,875
I see you've had a visitor.

1133
01:32:13,227 --> 01:32:15,504
Two. Nobody you know.

1134
01:32:15,604 --> 01:32:17,340
Who might that be?

1135
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:19,507
Don't get so hoity.

1136
01:32:19,650 --> 01:32:22,301
Just because you don't
know everybody in my life.

1137
01:32:23,028 --> 01:32:25,306
It was Eric's sister and her husband.

1138
01:32:25,406 --> 01:32:27,390
I didn't know he had one.

1139
01:32:27,616 --> 01:32:29,183
Here.

1140
01:32:30,244 --> 01:32:32,687
What do you think of that?

1141
01:32:32,997 --> 01:32:35,189
What is it?

1142
01:32:35,291 --> 01:32:37,276
Is that... is that you?

1143
01:32:37,376 --> 01:32:39,527
It was before I met Eric.

1144
01:32:41,422 --> 01:32:43,157
When was that, then?

1145
01:32:43,257 --> 01:32:45,409
Oh, just at the end of the war.

1146
01:32:45,509 --> 01:32:48,829
We worked in an ordnance
factory, making bombs.

1147
01:32:48,929 --> 01:32:50,748
You should have seen us.

1148
01:32:50,848 --> 01:32:52,707
All women.

1149
01:32:53,058 --> 01:32:55,543
We had some times.

1150
01:32:58,397 --> 01:33:00,508
You weren't married then?

1151
01:33:00,608 --> 01:33:02,009
No.

1152
01:33:02,109 --> 01:33:04,218
Had some chaps, though.

1153
01:33:04,528 --> 01:33:06,597
We had some good fun together.

1154
01:33:06,697 --> 01:33:11,350
Aye... I bet you gave
them a right run around.

1155
01:33:12,119 --> 01:33:14,437
Tell no stories, tell no lies.

1156
01:33:16,332 --> 01:33:19,066
Good God, Frank what have you done?

1157
01:33:23,088 --> 01:33:26,699
I-I don't look too good, do I?

1158
01:33:27,009 --> 01:33:30,244
I've aged ten years... d'you reckon?

1159
01:33:31,472 --> 01:33:33,332
What have you been doing?

1160
01:33:33,432 --> 01:33:35,334
Have you been fighting?

1161
01:33:35,434 --> 01:33:39,004
No, I got them broken.
The dentist pulled out the bits.

1162
01:33:39,104 --> 01:33:43,926
Six bits, ten guineas. I'm in
the wrong bloody business.

1163
01:33:44,026 --> 01:33:46,177
It's spoilt your looks.

1164
01:33:47,238 --> 01:33:49,513
So I've been told.

1165
01:33:49,740 --> 01:33:51,517
By a girl?

1166
01:33:51,617 --> 01:33:53,809
Who else worries about me?

1167
01:33:56,163 --> 01:33:58,606
You went to Weaver's, then?

1168
01:33:59,375 --> 01:34:01,275
Aye.

1169
01:34:03,295 --> 01:34:06,197
You look ill, Frank.
You oughtn't to have been out.

1170
01:34:08,175 --> 01:34:10,451
Here, what am I going to do...

1171
01:34:10,928 --> 01:34:13,079
with the, the presents for the kids?

1172
01:34:13,305 --> 01:34:15,499
Go on, go on, go on.

1173
01:34:15,599 --> 01:34:18,085
Well... I'll take them up with me
and put them in their stockings.

1174
01:34:18,185 --> 01:34:21,255
And I've... I've got
yours here, an' all.

1175
01:34:21,355 --> 01:34:23,382
You shouldn't have bothered.

1176
01:34:23,482 --> 01:34:25,426
D'you want it now?

1177
01:34:25,526 --> 01:34:27,134
What is it?

1178
01:34:27,278 --> 01:34:29,345
Well, take it.

1179
01:34:29,905 --> 01:34:32,641
No, no... leave it till the morning.

1180
01:34:32,741 --> 01:34:34,642
Don't spoil it.

1181
01:34:36,537 --> 01:34:38,312
Will you put the light out?

1182
01:35:18,412 --> 01:35:21,272
I'd never have guessed
you made bombs.

1183
01:35:22,625 --> 01:35:24,692
Why...

1184
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:27,695
why don't you come to bed with me?

1185
01:35:28,172 --> 01:35:30,740
It'll be cold and I
need looking after.

1186
01:35:32,801 --> 01:35:35,703
Thou knows Mother always
goes to bed with Santa.

1187
01:35:38,140 --> 01:35:39,957
All right.

1188
01:35:40,976 --> 01:35:43,502
But just for Christmas, mind?

1189
01:36:12,341 --> 01:36:14,285
All right, I'll make it... five quid.

1190
01:36:14,385 --> 01:36:16,285
Oh, watch your step, now.

1191
01:36:16,428 --> 01:36:18,245
Five quid?

1192
01:36:18,889 --> 01:36:21,082
Come on, it's only money.

1193
01:36:21,225 --> 01:36:23,586
He's worried. You've got
him worried, Maurice.

1194
01:36:23,686 --> 01:36:25,796
'Course, he's a family
man now, you know.

1195
01:36:25,896 --> 01:36:27,882
Aye, but whose bloody family?

1196
01:36:29,858 --> 01:36:33,053
Stuff it, love, or I'll belt you
right across that back seat!

1197
01:36:33,153 --> 01:36:35,805
Now, now... just because we've
got Frank in a corner...

1198
01:36:36,657 --> 01:36:38,267
All right, Maurice.

1199
01:36:38,367 --> 01:36:40,561
We'll see what you're made of.

1200
01:36:40,661 --> 01:36:42,436
There's ten quid there.

1201
01:36:42,663 --> 01:36:44,773
- Oh, bloody hell...
- Stop the bus, I'm getting off here!

1202
01:36:44,873 --> 01:36:46,317
I though you said you
were a friend of mine?

1203
01:36:46,417 --> 01:36:49,068
I am a friend of yours... I've given
you all the money, haven't I?

1204
01:36:54,133 --> 01:36:56,784
All right, I'll see you for ten quid.

1205
01:37:00,389 --> 01:37:02,124
What have you got?

1206
01:37:02,224 --> 01:37:03,958
Nothing much.

1207
01:37:04,309 --> 01:37:06,085
Two pair...

1208
01:37:07,771 --> 01:37:09,547
of kings!

1209
01:37:10,315 --> 01:37:12,051
Bloody hell!

1210
01:37:12,151 --> 01:37:13,761
I'd have bet the whole
stinking bus on 'em!

1211
01:37:13,861 --> 01:37:15,054
I'm not greedy, Maurice.

1212
01:37:15,154 --> 01:37:16,263
Thirty quid's enough.

1213
01:37:16,363 --> 01:37:17,598
She'll murder me.

1214
01:37:17,698 --> 01:37:18,974
Who, Judith?

1215
01:37:19,074 --> 01:37:21,434
- She bloody will an' all.
- Tell her it went to charity.

1216
01:37:22,119 --> 01:37:23,687
You lucky bleeder!

1217
01:37:23,787 --> 01:37:25,272
Is that what you call it?

1218
01:37:25,372 --> 01:37:26,565
It bloody is.

1219
01:37:26,665 --> 01:37:29,108
- Come on, Ken, do you want a hand?
- I might as well.

1220
01:37:32,129 --> 01:37:34,323
I hope you know what
you're doing with the cash.

1221
01:37:34,423 --> 01:37:36,075
I can take care of it, Len.

1222
01:37:36,175 --> 01:37:38,617
Aye, but can it take care of thee?

1223
01:37:39,595 --> 01:37:41,662
Get stuffed, love.

1224
01:37:46,852 --> 01:37:48,669
Margaret!

1225
01:37:49,313 --> 01:37:50,756
I'm coming.

1226
01:37:50,856 --> 01:37:53,591
Come on down, I've got
something to show you.

1227
01:37:55,027 --> 01:37:56,929
We won't be back
too late, Mrs Farrer.

1228
01:37:57,029 --> 01:37:58,305
Oh, all right.

1229
01:37:58,405 --> 01:38:02,309
Look here, why don't you pop
out and get yourself something?

1230
01:38:02,409 --> 01:38:04,728
It's all right, Mr Machin.

1231
01:38:04,828 --> 01:38:07,313
All right, I'll leave it
here for you, then.

1232
01:38:07,664 --> 01:38:09,565
Here she is.

1233
01:38:13,420 --> 01:38:15,072
Do you like it?

1234
01:38:15,172 --> 01:38:16,989
It's beautiful, love.

1235
01:38:17,341 --> 01:38:19,158
Oh, thanks.

1236
01:38:21,220 --> 01:38:23,122
Wait a minute, wait a minute...

1237
01:38:23,222 --> 01:38:24,373
What?

1238
01:38:24,473 --> 01:38:26,373
What's the mat...

1239
01:38:32,606 --> 01:38:35,925
Let's put this on, just for a change.

1240
01:38:41,323 --> 01:38:43,350
Oh, no, Frank.

1241
01:38:43,450 --> 01:38:47,019
It's yours. It's here,
it's nobody else's.

1242
01:38:47,704 --> 01:38:49,481
Don't be so silly, Frank, it...

1243
01:38:49,581 --> 01:38:51,732
I want you to have it.

1244
01:38:53,252 --> 01:38:55,571
Look, it won't bite.

1245
01:38:55,671 --> 01:38:57,573
Frank, I can't!

1246
01:38:57,673 --> 01:38:59,616
Well, I can't wear it.

1247
01:38:59,716 --> 01:39:01,994
Now, come on. Come on.

1248
01:39:02,094 --> 01:39:04,078
Oh...

1249
01:39:04,388 --> 01:39:06,165
Just for tonight, then.

1250
01:39:06,265 --> 01:39:08,333
Aye. Just for tonight.

1251
01:39:08,433 --> 01:39:10,501
At least that's a start.

1252
01:39:11,186 --> 01:39:12,753
Erm...

1253
01:39:13,647 --> 01:39:16,090
we won't be back late, Mrs Farrer.

1254
01:39:16,984 --> 01:39:18,968
All right, love.

1255
01:39:19,403 --> 01:39:20,971
Bye-bye for now, then.

1256
01:39:21,071 --> 01:39:23,097
Ta-ra.

1257
01:39:23,824 --> 01:39:25,391
Bye-bye.

1258
01:39:54,104 --> 01:39:56,422
I'm afraid this
table's reserved, sir.

1259
01:39:57,024 --> 01:39:59,259
Hah, you're right, it is reserved.

1260
01:39:59,359 --> 01:40:01,302
For us.

1261
01:40:02,821 --> 01:40:04,890
I'm sorry, sir,
there is a nice table...

1262
01:40:04,990 --> 01:40:07,057
Look, why don't you get lost, love?

1263
01:40:11,038 --> 01:40:13,524
We could have gone to another table.
He was only doing his job.

1264
01:40:13,624 --> 01:40:18,235
His what? You call that a job?
Traipsing about like a fifty-year old tart?

1265
01:40:19,838 --> 01:40:21,488
Oh, thank you.

1266
01:40:25,510 --> 01:40:26,870
Good evening, madam.

1267
01:40:26,970 --> 01:40:29,873
Oh, good evening, Mrs Weaver.
Mr Weaver. Nice to see you again.

1268
01:40:29,973 --> 01:40:32,042
- Hello, Tom. Keeping well?
- Very well, thank you, sir, and you?

1269
01:40:32,142 --> 01:40:35,546
Er, will you be going straight in,
sir, or will you order in the bar?

1270
01:40:35,646 --> 01:40:38,631
Yes... yes, I think we'll
have a drink first.

1271
01:40:39,066 --> 01:40:40,342
Good evening, madam.

1272
01:40:40,442 --> 01:40:42,217
Hello, Bruce.

1273
01:40:44,738 --> 01:40:46,265
And to follow, madam?

1274
01:40:46,365 --> 01:40:48,934
Er, bird? Duckling's
nice this evening.

1275
01:40:49,034 --> 01:40:51,268
Or meat... a nice steak?

1276
01:40:52,246 --> 01:40:53,981
Er, have you any roast meat?

1277
01:40:54,081 --> 01:40:55,482
Roast beef, madam.

1278
01:40:55,582 --> 01:40:57,818
Yes, and... some vegetables?

1279
01:40:57,918 --> 01:40:59,278
Cauliflower and roast potatoes.

1280
01:40:59,378 --> 01:41:00,779
Thank you very much, madam.

1281
01:41:00,879 --> 01:41:02,406
And for you, sir?

1282
01:41:02,506 --> 01:41:04,283
Well, let's have a look.

1283
01:41:04,383 --> 01:41:06,243
I'll have, er...

1284
01:41:06,343 --> 01:41:10,539
a nice piece of steak... blood rare
some cabbage and some potatoes.

1285
01:41:10,639 --> 01:41:12,207
Er, no soup, sir?

1286
01:41:12,307 --> 01:41:14,793
Aye, I'll have some soup but
make sure there's plenty of it.

1287
01:41:14,893 --> 01:41:17,087
Thank you very much, sir.
Er, anything to drink?

1288
01:41:17,187 --> 01:41:19,256
- Yes, I think we'll have...
- I'll send the wine waiter over, sir.

1289
01:41:19,356 --> 01:41:21,965
Well, what the bloody
hell did you ask me for?

1290
01:41:22,359 --> 01:41:25,511
I bet he comes back with a
bit of fried egg and bacon!

1291
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:30,849
Watch you don't burn his
whiskers, love! Ha, ha, ha!

1292
01:41:33,412 --> 01:41:35,854
You shouldn't have come here if
you're going to behave like this.

1293
01:41:35,956 --> 01:41:38,942
We're paying for it aren't we?
That's all they're interested in.

1294
01:41:39,042 --> 01:41:42,277
No, it's not. But if you're
going to act like a pig...

1295
01:41:42,587 --> 01:41:46,658
Well, if I'm a pig, what's this load
of fat bastards around here, then?

1296
01:41:46,758 --> 01:41:48,368
Frank, I've told you.

1297
01:41:48,468 --> 01:41:51,221
Now, enjoy yourself...
that's what this place is for.

1298
01:41:51,322 --> 01:41:53,665
I know how to handle these people.

1299
01:41:53,765 --> 01:41:56,293
How's it going, love?
Have they burnt your custard?

1300
01:41:56,393 --> 01:41:57,836
Really!

1301
01:41:57,936 --> 01:42:00,421
These old ladies,
you know they're a bit past it.

1302
01:42:04,318 --> 01:42:05,844
...well, he didn't know
quite what to say.

1303
01:42:05,944 --> 01:42:08,138
- Would you care to order now, sir?
- Oh, thank you.

1304
01:42:08,238 --> 01:42:09,930
Mrs Weaver.

1305
01:42:10,073 --> 01:42:12,184
Your table is already
reserved for you, sir.

1306
01:42:12,284 --> 01:42:14,309
Thank you very much, Thomas.

1307
01:42:14,703 --> 01:42:17,104
Isn't that Frank Machin down there?

1308
01:42:29,843 --> 01:42:32,619
I don't think she's getting
quite what she expected.

1309
01:42:33,138 --> 01:42:36,165
No... but then,
does anybody with Machin?

1310
01:42:37,017 --> 01:42:39,711
Give us the bill, love.
We're leaving.

1311
01:42:39,811 --> 01:42:41,545
Yes, sir.

1312
01:42:42,022 --> 01:42:44,590
- Can I have the fur coat, please?
- Yes, madam.

1313
01:42:44,691 --> 01:42:47,509
Poor thing, I feel
almost sorry for her.

1314
01:42:50,697 --> 01:42:52,432
Is there anything wrong, sir?

1315
01:42:52,532 --> 01:42:55,435
I don't mind paying for what we haven't
had, but has he added it up right?

1316
01:42:55,535 --> 01:42:58,187
I don't think your mate's
very good at his sums.

1317
01:42:58,288 --> 01:42:59,898
I don't think there's
any mistake, sir.

1318
01:42:59,998 --> 01:43:01,275
- Are you sure, now?
- Quite, sir.

1319
01:43:01,375 --> 01:43:04,359
Right. Good, I just
wanted to make certain.

1320
01:43:08,757 --> 01:43:13,036
Er... this is for your trouble.
Be careful how you spend it.

1321
01:43:13,136 --> 01:43:14,912
Thank you, sir.

1322
01:43:20,227 --> 01:43:22,377
Hello, Mr Weaver.

1323
01:43:33,990 --> 01:43:36,183
Good night, Mr Machin.

1324
01:43:53,260 --> 01:43:56,245
That was Mrs Weaver,
wasn't it, at the restaurant?

1325
01:43:57,389 --> 01:43:58,789
Aye.

1326
01:43:59,474 --> 01:44:01,458
Aren't you friends anymore?

1327
01:44:02,436 --> 01:44:03,670
Who with?

1328
01:44:03,770 --> 01:44:05,462
Them.

1329
01:44:07,315 --> 01:44:09,550
No, I...

1330
01:44:10,235 --> 01:44:12,344
I've got no need for them.

1331
01:44:21,163 --> 01:44:23,063
Are you coming up?

1332
01:44:23,248 --> 01:44:25,440
Yes... in a minute.

1333
01:45:09,294 --> 01:45:11,612
Well, Frank,
they've got a nice day for it.

1334
01:45:12,589 --> 01:45:13,824
Aye.

1335
01:45:13,924 --> 01:45:15,784
Are you feeling fit for Saturday?

1336
01:45:15,884 --> 01:45:17,868
- Champion, Mr. Slomer.
- That's the way.

1337
01:45:18,637 --> 01:45:21,163
We can't manage
without Frank, you know.

1338
01:45:24,893 --> 01:45:27,711
Congratulations. I hope
you'll both be very happy.

1339
01:45:39,074 --> 01:45:42,142
Aren't you going to kiss her? Go on.

1340
01:45:46,414 --> 01:45:48,649
I won't be a second, Margaret.

1341
01:46:02,722 --> 01:46:05,876
Congratulations, Maurice.
Best of luck. Look after her.

1342
01:46:05,976 --> 01:46:07,876
Thank you very much.

1343
01:46:08,186 --> 01:46:10,128
Well done, Judith.

1344
01:46:10,772 --> 01:46:13,049
See he keeps up to it,
and no backsliding.

1345
01:46:13,149 --> 01:46:14,841
Frank.

1346
01:46:16,695 --> 01:46:18,595
Thanks, Frank.

1347
01:46:20,240 --> 01:46:22,975
Oh, hello, Mr Slomer, how are you?

1348
01:46:37,090 --> 01:46:39,324
Margaret!

1349
01:46:39,509 --> 01:46:41,203
What's the matter?

1350
01:46:41,303 --> 01:46:43,288
Why'd you run off like that?

1351
01:46:43,388 --> 01:46:45,832
In front of all those people, and...

1352
01:46:45,932 --> 01:46:49,084
that young girl. It makes me ashamed.

1353
01:46:52,147 --> 01:46:53,964
Ashamed!

1354
01:46:56,067 --> 01:46:59,469
I'm a kept woman, Frank,
how else do you expect me to feel?

1355
01:47:00,905 --> 01:47:02,597
Oh, my God.

1356
01:47:03,825 --> 01:47:05,519
It's no good, Frank.

1357
01:47:05,619 --> 01:47:10,564
That car, me all dressed up in a fur
coat, living in the same house as you.

1358
01:47:10,749 --> 01:47:13,026
If you deal with dirt,
you look dirty.

1359
01:47:13,126 --> 01:47:15,193
People have got eyes, you know.

1360
01:47:16,588 --> 01:47:18,447
Oh...

1361
01:47:46,743 --> 01:47:49,019
You feel like dirt?

1362
01:47:50,330 --> 01:47:52,314
What do you think?

1363
01:47:53,958 --> 01:47:56,570
It sounds like you want to shove
me off to some other woman.

1364
01:47:56,670 --> 01:47:58,655
I don't need to do that, do I?

1365
01:47:58,755 --> 01:48:01,031
From what I hear,
you're never short of girls.

1366
01:48:02,342 --> 01:48:05,243
Well, if you think that,
why do you stick with me still?

1367
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:07,788
I reckon you'll leave me soon.

1368
01:48:08,932 --> 01:48:13,877
Well, that's the first I've
ever heard of it; me leaving.

1369
01:48:14,312 --> 01:48:16,755
I know how you are.

1370
01:48:19,401 --> 01:48:22,010
I thought you were
beginning to feel happy.

1371
01:48:22,696 --> 01:48:24,679
Happy?

1372
01:48:26,491 --> 01:48:28,809
I could say something there,
but I won't.

1373
01:48:29,536 --> 01:48:31,436
Well, go on, say it.

1374
01:48:32,455 --> 01:48:35,899
I'd like to hear you say it;
I'd like to hear you say all of it.

1375
01:48:37,836 --> 01:48:40,529
You don't understand at all, do you?

1376
01:49:13,329 --> 01:49:16,148
You can always sell it if
you're so sure I'm leaving.

1377
01:49:30,722 --> 01:49:33,373
You can open a shop soon with
all the stuff I've bought you.

1378
01:49:33,808 --> 01:49:35,794
You've given us nothing
you haven't had to.

1379
01:49:35,894 --> 01:49:39,172
You don't seem to understand the
reason I've done these things for you.

1380
01:49:39,272 --> 01:49:42,175
Of course I do. It makes you
feel good, it makes you feel big.

1381
01:49:42,275 --> 01:49:43,802
You know how you like to feel big.

1382
01:49:43,902 --> 01:49:46,513
You don't appreciate one bloody
thing I've done for you.

1383
01:49:46,613 --> 01:49:48,056
I've given you a life!

1384
01:49:48,156 --> 01:49:51,643
A life better than any other woman
in this street, but you will not admit it!

1385
01:49:51,743 --> 01:49:55,178
Admit it? You must be mad.
I can't lift my head up in the street

1386
01:49:55,279 --> 01:49:58,606
without somebody pointing at
me and saying I'm your slut!

1387
01:49:58,917 --> 01:50:00,276
Who says that?

1388
01:50:00,376 --> 01:50:03,135
'Who says that?' Just listen to him!
They all laugh at you,

1389
01:50:03,236 --> 01:50:05,921
they all point you out, don't you
know that? Trying to be different!

1390
01:50:06,022 --> 01:50:08,318
And they point me out too,
and Ian and Lynda.

1391
01:50:08,418 --> 01:50:09,861
We're not proper people
now because of you.

1392
01:50:09,961 --> 01:50:12,414
Because you show off every Saturday
in front of thousands of them,

1393
01:50:12,514 --> 01:50:14,207
because you're... you're just
a great ape on a football field.

1394
01:50:14,307 --> 01:50:16,000
Because you want me to be like them!

1395
01:50:16,100 --> 01:50:18,128
You want me to crawl
about just like the rest.

1396
01:50:18,228 --> 01:50:22,214
Well, just have a look at the rest.
Take a right good look at 'em.

1397
01:50:23,942 --> 01:50:26,218
Take a right good look at the
bloody people round here.

1398
01:50:26,986 --> 01:50:28,847
There isn't a bleeding
man amongst 'em.

1399
01:50:28,947 --> 01:50:31,599
You're flat on your backs,
and the world crawls above you!

1400
01:50:31,699 --> 01:50:34,561
Because they haven't the guts.
Do you understand that?

1401
01:50:34,661 --> 01:50:37,689
They haven't the guts to stand
up and to walk about like me!

1402
01:50:37,789 --> 01:50:40,316
Shout as much as you like,
but just get out of here.

1403
01:50:40,416 --> 01:50:42,110
I don't want you in my house anymore.

1404
01:50:42,210 --> 01:50:44,654
You know you need me.
Why don't you admit it?

1405
01:50:44,754 --> 01:50:46,114
Leave me alone!

1406
01:50:46,214 --> 01:50:49,282
I won't leave you alone,
not until you admit it!

1407
01:50:50,301 --> 01:50:52,953
Margaret, what's the matter?
Margaret?

1408
01:50:53,304 --> 01:50:55,038
Leave me alone.

1409
01:50:59,352 --> 01:51:01,294
Aren't you well?

1410
01:51:02,856 --> 01:51:05,048
Can't you get it into your head?

1411
01:51:05,441 --> 01:51:07,467
We don't need you.

1412
01:51:11,489 --> 01:51:13,348
I don't understand her.

1413
01:51:13,992 --> 01:51:16,601
I don't understand what
she wants from me.

1414
01:51:19,831 --> 01:51:22,023
'A great ape on a football field'.

1415
01:51:24,586 --> 01:51:26,695
That's what she called me.

1416
01:51:27,005 --> 01:51:29,614
A great ape on a football field!

1417
01:51:31,217 --> 01:51:33,495
That's about what we are, isn't it?

1418
01:51:33,595 --> 01:51:35,745
She makes me feel like that.

1419
01:51:37,307 --> 01:51:39,791
She makes me feel clumsy...

1420
01:51:40,810 --> 01:51:45,297
awkward, and big, and... stupid.

1421
01:51:47,275 --> 01:51:49,884
She makes me feel like...

1422
01:51:51,404 --> 01:51:53,555
she makes me feel like...

1423
01:51:53,781 --> 01:51:56,016
I crush...

1424
01:51:56,326 --> 01:51:59,060
I... I crush everything.

1425
01:52:02,582 --> 01:52:06,401
Maybe you're too rough on her.
Some women can't stand it, you know.

1426
01:52:08,212 --> 01:52:09,823
Hallo, Frank.

1427
01:52:09,923 --> 01:52:11,658
Hallo, Maurice.

1428
01:52:11,758 --> 01:52:13,952
I say, you took a bit
of a knock last week!

1429
01:52:14,052 --> 01:52:16,119
I reckon it takes
something to lay you out!

1430
01:52:16,220 --> 01:52:18,623
Aye, see you do better next Saturday!

1431
01:52:25,772 --> 01:52:29,883
That's what they think of me, isn't it?
A great ape on a football field.

1432
01:52:31,194 --> 01:52:32,683
They want someone to act big,

1433
01:52:32,784 --> 01:52:35,271
because they haven't got
the guts to do it themselves.

1434
01:52:36,741 --> 01:52:39,434
They want a hero,
and I am; I am a hero.

1435
01:52:40,078 --> 01:52:41,688
But she won't admit it.

1436
01:52:41,788 --> 01:52:43,813
Do you understand that?

1437
01:52:45,291 --> 01:52:49,110
She needs me, Maurice,
but she will not admit it.

1438
01:52:52,340 --> 01:52:55,825
That's all right. But you can't
be like that to a... to a woman.

1439
01:52:57,553 --> 01:52:59,120
Maurice...

1440
01:53:00,056 --> 01:53:01,998
Maurice, I'm...

1441
01:53:03,810 --> 01:53:06,378
I'm not going to be a
footballer forever.

1442
01:53:07,981 --> 01:53:09,966
I need something...

1443
01:53:10,066 --> 01:53:11,966
for good.

1444
01:53:13,611 --> 01:53:15,845
Something permanent.

1445
01:53:16,531 --> 01:53:18,473
And you reckon it's her?

1446
01:53:22,370 --> 01:53:24,354
Grab my hand.

1447
01:53:33,881 --> 01:53:36,825
I can love someone, can't I?

1448
01:53:38,970 --> 01:53:41,788
I can, can't I?

1449
01:53:45,101 --> 01:53:47,210
I can.

1450
01:53:48,021 --> 01:53:50,463
Perhaps she's the wrong one.

1451
01:53:53,109 --> 01:53:55,176
I need her.

1452
01:53:58,489 --> 01:54:02,308
She's the one thing that
makes me feel wanted.

1453
01:54:06,289 --> 01:54:08,606
I can't lose her.

1454
01:54:17,133 --> 01:54:19,534
You'd better see a doctor.

1455
01:54:20,136 --> 01:54:22,412
I'm just tired.

1456
01:54:30,188 --> 01:54:32,380
Are you going now or in the morning?

1457
01:54:33,399 --> 01:54:35,425
I'm not going at all.

1458
01:54:36,277 --> 01:54:37,929
What is it you want to make you go?

1459
01:54:38,029 --> 01:54:40,054
I want nothing that you've got.

1460
01:54:40,406 --> 01:54:42,223
I'm staying.

1461
01:54:51,209 --> 01:54:55,320
Thank God there's one part of
my life you've never touched.

1462
01:54:55,630 --> 01:54:57,530
You mean Eric?

1463
01:54:58,758 --> 01:55:03,121
He's the one thing you can't touch.
And he's the one really good thing.

1464
01:55:03,221 --> 01:55:06,791
Well, let's all get down on our knees and
pray for the good soul of Eric Hammond...

1465
01:55:06,891 --> 01:55:08,793
the father of this house!

1466
01:55:08,893 --> 01:55:10,545
How he must hurt you!

1467
01:55:10,645 --> 01:55:13,840
Well, come on, come on, then... let's put
his bloody boots right back in the hearth!

1468
01:55:13,940 --> 01:55:16,467
You don't know. You don't know.
You don't know.

1469
01:55:16,567 --> 01:55:18,761
If I've seen a crazy thing
in my life, that's it.

1470
01:55:18,861 --> 01:55:22,473
I know enough about you to keep you in
a rubber room for the rest of your life!

1471
01:55:22,573 --> 01:55:25,643
You know nothing about Eric, or me.
You know nothing about Eric!

1472
01:55:25,743 --> 01:55:28,770
I know he put the file
through his guts.

1473
01:55:29,497 --> 01:55:32,565
And you made him so happy,
he went and killed himself!

1474
01:55:34,085 --> 01:55:36,070
Do you want to kill me?

1475
01:55:36,170 --> 01:55:39,240
Eric is dead, you understand?
Eric is dead.

1476
01:55:39,340 --> 01:55:40,708
You make me feel I'm nothing.

1477
01:55:40,808 --> 01:55:42,791
- I want you.
- You want to crush me,

1478
01:55:42,892 --> 01:55:46,581
but I won't let you. Because I'm the one
thing you can't have, like everything else!

1479
01:55:46,681 --> 01:55:49,208
- I want you.
- I want you to go.

1480
01:55:49,308 --> 01:55:50,668
I need you.

1481
01:55:50,768 --> 01:55:54,380
I want you to go! I want you to go!
I want you to go...

1482
01:56:24,177 --> 01:56:25,536
Get out!

1483
01:56:25,636 --> 01:56:27,163
- Margaret.
- Get out!

1484
01:56:27,263 --> 01:56:30,625
Oh, please! Please, leave me alone.

1485
01:56:30,725 --> 01:56:32,085
I can't.

1486
01:56:32,185 --> 01:56:33,878
Leave me alone.

1487
01:56:33,978 --> 01:56:37,088
I can't. I can't. I love you.

1488
01:56:42,069 --> 01:56:44,429
I want you to go!

1489
01:56:46,240 --> 01:56:48,224
All right, I'm going.

1490
01:56:49,744 --> 01:56:52,395
And that's the last you'll ever see.

1491
01:57:08,221 --> 01:57:10,455
You're not in any trouble, are you?

1492
01:57:13,976 --> 01:57:16,129
Oh, I'll take your word for it.

1493
01:57:16,229 --> 01:57:18,171
Don't mind who I take,
I'm not choosy.

1494
01:57:21,108 --> 01:57:23,635
But any trouble and no, thank you.

1495
01:57:24,195 --> 01:57:28,014
That's why I gave you that queer
look when you came in just now.

1496
01:57:28,783 --> 01:57:32,769
I always give that look when I
think people might cause trouble.

1497
01:57:33,037 --> 01:57:35,772
I find it puts them off.

1498
01:57:36,123 --> 01:57:37,942
Does Johnson still live here?

1499
01:57:38,042 --> 01:57:40,193
He went a while ago.

1500
01:57:49,470 --> 01:57:51,330
This is yours.

1501
01:57:51,430 --> 01:57:53,748
You'll be all right here, Whacker.

1502
01:57:55,017 --> 01:57:57,519
You got a lock on that?
You'll be all right.

1503
01:57:57,620 --> 01:58:00,798
These two alarm clocks are nippy,
but they're nice when you know 'em.

1504
01:58:00,898 --> 01:58:02,882
Down here for a holiday?

1505
01:58:17,123 --> 01:58:19,899
By the by, is that
your car out there?

1506
01:58:20,751 --> 01:58:22,987
I meant to tell you, Whacker,
the nippers are mustard round here.

1507
01:58:23,087 --> 01:58:25,363
It'll be all spare parts if
you leave it too long.

1508
01:58:30,636 --> 01:58:33,079
If you want it cleaning
I'll do it for a dollar.

1509
02:00:29,964 --> 02:00:33,117
You'll be all right, now...
you'll be all right.

1510
02:00:33,217 --> 02:00:36,410
Come on, then...
let's get you to bed...

1511
02:00:44,353 --> 02:00:46,339
Is that you?

1512
02:00:46,439 --> 02:00:48,382
Is that you, Frank?

1513
02:00:52,611 --> 02:00:54,929
You dirty bastard!

1514
02:01:20,014 --> 02:01:21,832
Mr Machin?

1515
02:01:21,932 --> 02:01:23,791
Mr Machin.

1516
02:01:25,644 --> 02:01:28,603
If it's Mrs Hammond, she's been
taken ill. She's in the hospital.

1517
02:01:28,704 --> 02:01:30,631
I've got Lynda and Ian with me.

1518
02:01:32,067 --> 02:01:33,511
What?

1519
02:01:33,611 --> 02:01:36,596
Mrs Hammond... she's been taken ill.

1520
02:01:41,535 --> 02:01:43,436
What is it?

1521
02:01:43,746 --> 02:01:45,564
It's an attack.

1522
02:01:45,664 --> 02:01:47,483
Some sort of an attack.

1523
02:01:47,583 --> 02:01:50,026
I've got Lynda and Ian in with me.

1524
02:01:53,088 --> 02:01:54,906
Where is she?

1525
02:01:55,299 --> 02:01:57,491
It's the County.

1526
02:01:58,302 --> 02:02:00,786
It were just a couple of days, I...

1527
02:02:01,472 --> 02:02:03,372
She's badly.

1528
02:02:04,975 --> 02:02:07,628
It's a haemorrhage on
the brain, I'm afraid.

1529
02:02:07,728 --> 02:02:09,004
Is that serious?

1530
02:02:09,104 --> 02:02:12,131
Serious? Oh, yes, it's serious.

1531
02:02:12,942 --> 02:02:14,552
I mean...

1532
02:02:14,652 --> 02:02:16,595
she won't die, will she?

1533
02:02:16,695 --> 02:02:18,804
I'm afraid I can't say.

1534
02:02:19,156 --> 02:02:21,849
She's weak; she's weak all through.

1535
02:02:22,535 --> 02:02:25,144
To be frank, she hasn't the strength.

1536
02:02:25,621 --> 02:02:28,439
And, more important, I doubt
if she even has the will.

1537
02:02:33,629 --> 02:02:35,404
Where is she?

1538
02:02:46,892 --> 02:02:49,669
I think you'd better leave
her now, Mr Machin.

1539
02:03:38,485 --> 02:03:40,678
Margaret.

1540
02:03:42,239 --> 02:03:44,140
Margaret.

1541
02:03:49,538 --> 02:03:51,647
Margaret, it's nothing.

1542
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:55,401
It's nothing at all.

1543
02:03:57,838 --> 02:03:59,989
It's nothing, Margaret.

1544
02:04:01,425 --> 02:04:03,367
You're all right.

1545
02:04:08,766 --> 02:04:10,958
You're... you're all right.

1546
02:04:13,020 --> 02:04:15,713
You're going to be
all right, Margaret.

1547
02:04:19,276 --> 02:04:21,677
You're going to be all right now.

1548
02:04:22,780 --> 02:04:24,722
You're sa fe.

1549
02:04:27,701 --> 02:04:29,518
You're sa fe, Margaret.

1550
02:04:34,333 --> 02:04:36,067
Margaret...

1551
02:04:37,211 --> 02:04:40,571
You... can't go like this.

1552
02:04:41,715 --> 02:04:43,991
You can't leave me.

1553
02:04:46,887 --> 02:04:48,746
You mustn't be mean.

1554
02:04:49,014 --> 02:04:50,790
Margaret.

1555
02:04:54,436 --> 02:04:56,629
Margaret, you can't leave me.

1556
02:04:57,189 --> 02:04:59,090
You can't.

1557
02:05:00,943 --> 02:05:03,344
You mustn't be mean, Margaret.

1558
02:05:57,249 --> 02:05:59,441
Doctor!

1559
02:06:16,769 --> 02:06:18,878
She's gone.

1560
02:06:23,609 --> 02:06:25,467
Sorry.

1561
02:06:35,454 --> 02:06:37,354
No.

1562
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:52,703
No, she's not.

1563
02:07:12,574 --> 02:07:14,558
No!

1564
02:10:13,714 --> 02:10:47,062
Margaret.

1565
02:11:12,731 --> 02:11:15,466
Oh, Margaret...

1566
02:11:33,919 --> 02:11:36,987
Margaret!

1567
02:12:35,814 --> 02:12:39,800
Come on, Machin,
get a bloody move on!
