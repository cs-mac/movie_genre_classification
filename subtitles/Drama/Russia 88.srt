1
00:00:47,869 --> 00:00:49,129
I'm going to bed.

2
00:00:49,306 --> 00:00:52,544
- You drink one glass of wine and you fall asleep.
- It was two.

3
00:00:55,356 --> 00:00:57,831
You'll get your masters,
Miss. 3-day student.

4
00:01:14,412 --> 00:01:17,877
- Do you think it's an accident?
- Who would want to kill princess Dy?

5
00:01:18,403 --> 00:01:20,383
She's so young and so beautifull!

6
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:24,880
I'm going to sleep.

7
00:01:41,378 --> 00:01:43,613
Jony, don't forget to feed kitty.

8
00:01:46,901 --> 00:01:50,243
Kitty, kitty, dinner time!

9
00:02:19,817 --> 00:02:21,235
Turn the music down!

10
00:02:32,893 --> 00:02:35,954
Kitty, kitty, dinner's ready.

11
00:02:38,376 --> 00:02:39,141
Kitty!

12
00:02:55,681 --> 00:02:57,526
Kitty, kitty, dinner is ready.

13
00:02:59,943 --> 00:03:01,428
Kitty, dinner's ready.

14
00:05:05,035 --> 00:05:07,195
Why didn't you feed the cat, already?

15
00:05:51,382 --> 00:05:53,306
Hey, shut that damn cat off.

16
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,495
What is your name?

17
00:06:09,718 --> 00:06:11,970
Chainy. Kates.

18
00:06:14,257 --> 00:06:16,237
And the deceased was your sister?

19
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:18,469
Her name is Jony.

20
00:06:19,691 --> 00:06:20,771
We are twins.

21
00:06:24,062 --> 00:06:25,739
Were you able to see
who did this?

22
00:06:26,904 --> 00:06:28,029
Just a glimps.

23
00:06:31,231 --> 00:06:32,266
It was dark.

24
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:35,466
I'm not certain.

25
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,313
It is my opinion as a forensic psychiatrist

26
00:06:48,313 --> 00:06:50,713
that John Forster is a serial psychopath.

27
00:06:51,234 --> 00:06:53,844
If allowed to remain a free man in our society,

28
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:56,824
he will rape ang murder again.

29
00:06:59,397 --> 00:07:01,377
Will the defendant, please, rise.

30
00:07:03,559 --> 00:07:07,007
We, the jury, on this day, November 9th 1998,

31
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:10,750
find the defendant John Forster guilty

32
00:07:11,174 --> 00:07:13,019
of murder in the first degree.

33
00:08:28,348 --> 00:08:30,947
Oh, I've seen that outfit before.

34
00:08:31,347 --> 00:08:33,226
I can't remember when.

35
00:08:33,386 --> 00:08:35,905
Last night. Last night!

36
00:08:37,144 --> 00:08:38,703
These things do return.

37
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:42,502
God, my head is still
pounding like a drum.

38
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,061
You party hard.

39
00:08:44,701 --> 00:08:47,339
Yeah, well, you don't
look worse than I am.

40
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,426
I didn't drink as much as you.

41
00:08:49,499 --> 00:08:51,177
History of my life, Sara.

42
00:08:51,738 --> 00:08:54,736
Psychiatrist by day,
party animal by night.

43
00:08:54,937 --> 00:08:57,367
I thought you've told
me you were a lawyer.

44
00:08:57,456 --> 00:08:59,054
I'm not, yet.

45
00:09:01,853 --> 00:09:03,132
Excuse me.

46
00:09:04,331 --> 00:09:06,731
Yeah. Hey, Jack. It's Shelly.

47
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:10,009
I've been calling all morning.
You OK? I'm Ok. What's up?

48
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:11,128
I was worried.

49
00:09:11,128 --> 00:09:13,604
You worry too much,
Shelly. What's going on?

50
00:09:13,847 --> 00:09:16,286
Frank Parks is been calling. He
needs to speak with you immediately.

51
00:09:16,286 --> 00:09:17,765
Pass him through.

52
00:09:20,123 --> 00:09:23,002
I had fun last night, Miss. Pollard.

53
00:09:23,363 --> 00:09:24,482
Me too.

54
00:09:24,761 --> 00:09:27,161
Thanks for the wine tasting, Dr. Gramm.

55
00:09:27,761 --> 00:09:28,680
Jack.

56
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,878
Hey, Jack, I've got
Frank Parks. Go ahead.

57
00:09:33,038 --> 00:09:34,878
Hey, Frank. Jack.

58
00:09:36,036 --> 00:09:37,386
We got another one.

59
00:09:37,596 --> 00:09:39,355
Oh, no. The same?

60
00:09:39,594 --> 00:09:40,675
Every detail.

61
00:09:41,195 --> 00:09:43,355
Right down to the lateral laceration.

62
00:09:46,311 --> 00:09:48,510
It's the Seattle slayer again.

63
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,636
Where are you now? Look, Jack.

64
00:09:51,189 --> 00:09:52,549
There's a tape.

65
00:09:53,069 --> 00:09:54,734
You're gonna wanna see it.

66
00:09:56,067 --> 00:09:58,067
Jack, are you still there?

67
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:00,865
Yeah.

68
00:10:05,743 --> 00:10:07,502
Meet me at my office, okay?

69
00:10:07,662 --> 00:10:09,100
Sure, Jack.

70
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:31,730
Where to?

71
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:34,249
114 Western, please. Quickly.

72
00:10:41,206 --> 00:10:42,804
Welcome back, Seattle.

73
00:10:42,885 --> 00:10:45,764
We're continuing our
interview with John Forster...

74
00:10:45,963 --> 00:10:49,294
Who was convicted for the death
of Janie Kay, nine years ago...

75
00:10:49,361 --> 00:10:53,360
Based on the eyewitness testimony
of her twin sister, Janie Kay.

76
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,678
John Forster was dated to die at
midnight, at Walla Walla Penitentiary.

77
00:10:56,678 --> 00:10:58,396
Do you mind changing it? John Forster.

78
00:10:58,396 --> 00:11:00,512
What's your reaction to the State...

79
00:11:02,835 --> 00:11:03,794
Thank you.

80
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,848
Congratulations!

81
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,690
For what?

82
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,054
I was referring to the hottie that
you left with the party last night.

83
00:11:33,054 --> 00:11:34,454
She was a quite piece of ass.

84
00:11:34,454 --> 00:11:37,096
Remember her name? Yes, I do.

85
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:38,578
Sara Pollard.

86
00:11:38,857 --> 00:11:42,141
Is that a cut on your nose? You
didn't have that before I left.

87
00:11:42,141 --> 00:11:44,542
I fell out of the bed. FBI hit here yet?

88
00:11:44,623 --> 00:11:47,465
Yeah, 2 minutes in the
conference room. Okay.

89
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,266
Any calls?

90
00:11:49,467 --> 00:11:51,508
New York Times,
Washington times, Newsweek.

91
00:11:51,508 --> 00:11:54,790
They all wanna know if you have
a quote about Forster's execution.

92
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:57,594
What else is new? Kim
Cummings called twice.

93
00:11:57,673 --> 00:12:00,396
She was worried about you
too. Kim knows this procedure.

94
00:12:00,396 --> 00:12:02,757
Apparently not. She's in your office.

95
00:12:03,358 --> 00:12:05,280
Jack Gramm Associates.

96
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,362
I put those case reports you
wanna me to look at on your desk.

97
00:12:08,362 --> 00:12:12,046
I thought Lauren and Leeza
showed real insight and ability.

98
00:12:12,245 --> 00:12:14,207
The others were pretty
much working the math.

99
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,208
Yeah.

100
00:12:18,731 --> 00:12:21,572
Don't you have Federal
Agents waiting for you?

101
00:12:23,575 --> 00:12:24,376
Yeah.

102
00:12:24,415 --> 00:12:26,257
I' see you in class.

103
00:12:26,417 --> 00:12:29,212
I'll take them trough
today's work if you run late.

104
00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:30,460
Thanks.

105
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,462
Thank you, Kim. Bye.

106
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:38,387
Janie Keith came by
to give you a present.

107
00:12:38,788 --> 00:12:40,068
Dr. Gramm.

108
00:12:40,108 --> 00:12:42,350
I'm sorry. I don't know
if this is appropriate...

109
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,712
I just wanted to...

110
00:12:44,111 --> 00:12:46,433
I just wanted to mark the day.

111
00:12:46,674 --> 00:12:47,936
Thank you, Janie.

112
00:12:47,955 --> 00:12:51,918
I'm glad that my sister Janie
hasn't been forgotten. Thank you.

113
00:12:52,318 --> 00:12:55,161
For everything. You
went out of your way.

114
00:12:56,121 --> 00:12:58,924
You are busy, so I'm just...
I'm gonna get out of here.

115
00:12:58,924 --> 00:13:02,527
We did good, Janie. We did good.

116
00:13:02,647 --> 00:13:03,807
All right.

117
00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:05,208
Thanks.

118
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,654
Can I help you?

119
00:13:10,933 --> 00:13:12,614
You are one of my students?

120
00:13:12,614 --> 00:13:13,816
Hi.

121
00:13:14,576 --> 00:13:15,777
Jack. Yeah.

122
00:13:15,978 --> 00:13:19,764
I'd like to introduce you to Jeremy
Goober, with attorney general office.

123
00:13:19,981 --> 00:13:22,744
Jeremy is in charge of the
Seattle slayer task force.

124
00:13:22,744 --> 00:13:26,506
Dr. Gramm, it's so good to meet you.
This is a really big honor for me.

125
00:13:26,546 --> 00:13:27,853
Sorry about the...

126
00:13:27,987 --> 00:13:30,029
Oh, this is such a beautiful
conference room too.

127
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:32,508
And this special agent
MacTire from the FBI.

128
00:13:32,591 --> 00:13:33,632
Dr. Gramm.

129
00:13:33,912 --> 00:13:35,754
Pleasure. Have a seat.

130
00:13:37,756 --> 00:13:39,077
Hey, big fellow?

131
00:13:39,317 --> 00:13:40,278
Yes.

132
00:13:41,878 --> 00:13:43,000
Jeremy.

133
00:13:44,521 --> 00:13:47,644
Seattle slayer task force.

134
00:13:47,684 --> 00:13:51,808
Well, okay. I'm sure you
have a lot of questions.

135
00:13:52,488 --> 00:13:56,331
I'll do the best I can to
answer them, but first I...

136
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:01,334
No. First I think we
should all have a cookie.

137
00:14:01,495 --> 00:14:06,338
These are from Janie Kay, whose sister,
Janie was murdered by John Forster.

138
00:14:06,819 --> 00:14:09,142
Jeremy? Sure, thank you.

139
00:14:10,422 --> 00:14:13,505
Frank? No, thanks, Jack.

140
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:14,946
No?

141
00:14:15,426 --> 00:14:16,828
Mr. MacTire?

142
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:20,393
You are a good sport, Jeremy.

143
00:14:20,751 --> 00:14:23,113
A little milk maybe, what do you think?

144
00:14:26,915 --> 00:14:30,399
Shelley, we got milk, don't
we? Bring in three glasses.

145
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:32,201
Nothing for me, Jack.

146
00:14:32,841 --> 00:14:34,122
All right, make that two.

147
00:14:34,122 --> 00:14:35,562
No, make it three.

148
00:14:36,363 --> 00:14:38,346
Maybe you have a change of heart.

149
00:14:39,406 --> 00:14:41,088
So, let's see...

150
00:14:42,528 --> 00:14:43,889
I can assume...

151
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:47,052
That last night crime scene...

152
00:14:47,092 --> 00:14:50,295
Was very much like Forster's
previous crime scene, right?

153
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:52,989
They totally match, yeah.
What totally matches?

154
00:14:54,298 --> 00:14:56,099
I have in here...

155
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:04,554
Halothane on the breath.
Subdued by Halothane.

156
00:15:04,707 --> 00:15:06,188
Rape. Yeah.

157
00:15:06,508 --> 00:15:08,470
The body was hung up side down.

158
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,430
Yes.

159
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,632
And...

160
00:15:13,354 --> 00:15:14,795
Slashed throat.

161
00:15:16,637 --> 00:15:19,251
And where this takes us?
Looks like a copy cat.

162
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,273
It could be. Maybe Could be? Maybe?

163
00:15:22,801 --> 00:15:25,403
Maybe. It's a stage scene. Maybe what?

164
00:15:25,605 --> 00:15:27,966
Maybe, and this might be far-Fetched...

165
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,968
But what if the perp
worked with Forster...

166
00:15:31,169 --> 00:15:35,271
And these stage scenes were intended to
throw some doubts on his guilty verdict?

167
00:15:35,532 --> 00:15:37,694
Go with it. Possibly providing him...

168
00:15:37,694 --> 00:15:41,016
With a stay of execution
or even a new trial.

169
00:15:41,617 --> 00:15:44,699
Goal star, Jeremy. Big goal star.

170
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:47,829
I mean, that's exactly what
I think is happening here.

171
00:15:48,343 --> 00:15:50,624
No, I'm sticking with copy cat.

172
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:53,187
Of course there is another possibility.

173
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:55,228
Yeah? Forster is innocent.

174
00:15:55,469 --> 00:15:56,956
Wrongly convicted. No!

175
00:15:57,069 --> 00:15:58,737
The task force is aware...

176
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,913
That your expert opinion was
critical in convicting Forster.

177
00:16:01,913 --> 00:16:03,715
But then why he walked his first trial?

178
00:16:03,715 --> 00:16:04,977
Procedural error.

179
00:16:05,117 --> 00:16:08,119
Why is he never been tried in any of
the other five pending murderers...

180
00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:10,000
That you've attributed to him?

181
00:16:11,001 --> 00:16:14,205
You realize that it is the dude of my
office to ensure that an innocent man...

182
00:16:14,205 --> 00:16:17,086
Is not executed tonight.
You do understand that?

183
00:16:17,327 --> 00:16:21,449
Look, Jack. If you have any
reconsideration of testimony...

184
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,132
Or anything new you
wanna lay on the table...

185
00:16:24,132 --> 00:16:25,573
Now it would be the time.

186
00:16:25,573 --> 00:16:27,174
Would you say it was
fair to characterize...

187
00:16:27,174 --> 00:16:28,535
Your attitude towards John Forster...

188
00:16:28,535 --> 00:16:32,619
As a personal vendetta? Lf
we're been fair, yeah, sure.

189
00:16:32,898 --> 00:16:36,302
It's a personal vendetta. I have a
personal vendetta against Ted Bundy...

190
00:16:36,302 --> 00:16:39,745
And Gacy and about 10 or
15 other serial murders...

191
00:16:39,945 --> 00:16:42,227
That are on the streets
right now. Jack, please.

192
00:16:42,227 --> 00:16:43,399
That's helpful.

193
00:16:44,109 --> 00:16:46,750
There is one other issue
that we need to address.

194
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,071
Milk maid.

195
00:17:04,044 --> 00:17:05,487
What's going on here?

196
00:17:05,766 --> 00:17:08,529
Do you know a woman named Dale Morris?

197
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:10,089
Yes.

198
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,730
How?

199
00:17:12,211 --> 00:17:15,186
She's a student of mine.
She's just a student of yours?

200
00:17:16,014 --> 00:17:19,378
Dr. Gramm, we're federal agency
here. You don't wanna be lying here.

201
00:17:19,378 --> 00:17:22,700
We had a relationship. You've
been very cryptic right now?

202
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:26,903
He had a professional relationship,
not a sexual relationship.

203
00:17:27,544 --> 00:17:30,564
About a year ago her father
died. She was very troubled.

204
00:17:30,746 --> 00:17:33,589
I treated her as psychiatrist.

205
00:17:33,868 --> 00:17:36,511
I don't sleep with my
students, Mr. Goober.

206
00:17:36,751 --> 00:17:38,874
Neither I sleep with my patients.

207
00:17:39,913 --> 00:17:43,958
Now what does this have to
do with anything? Anyway.

208
00:17:44,037 --> 00:17:45,638
Jack.

209
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:48,361
Dale Morris was murdered last night.

210
00:17:48,602 --> 00:17:50,630
She's the third and latest victim.

211
00:17:53,805 --> 00:17:55,927
When was the last time you saw Dale?

212
00:17:57,168 --> 00:17:58,370
Well...

213
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,251
I saw...

214
00:18:04,654 --> 00:18:06,096
I saw her last night.

215
00:18:07,497 --> 00:18:10,779
To our impossibly difficult professor.

216
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,381
We say thank you...

217
00:18:14,462 --> 00:18:16,664
For making our lives miserable.

218
00:18:17,385 --> 00:18:19,026
The pleasure is all mine.

219
00:18:30,895 --> 00:18:32,016
We're celebrating.

220
00:18:32,016 --> 00:18:34,628
You're celebrating
Forster's pending execution?

221
00:18:35,055 --> 00:18:40,535
No, we're celebrating his
conviction, not his execution.

222
00:18:41,094 --> 00:18:44,921
It was an overturn so we're happy about that.
We worked hard on this case.

223
00:18:45,093 --> 00:18:47,852
We have a tape that was
left on the crime scene.

224
00:18:49,516 --> 00:18:51,453
We're gonna play it for you now.

225
00:18:53,013 --> 00:18:56,172
This message is for Dr. Jack Gramm.

226
00:18:58,811 --> 00:19:00,891
You got the wrong man.

227
00:19:01,131 --> 00:19:02,527
Forster is innocent.

228
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:04,811
Please, don't hurt me anymore.

229
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,130
Don't hurt me anymore.

230
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:10,369
You gonna let me go, right?

231
00:19:12,289 --> 00:19:15,441
You said you'd let me go. I've
read what you want me and...

232
00:19:25,847 --> 00:19:29,246
Jack, it goes like that for
about an hour, before she dies.

233
00:19:29,446 --> 00:19:32,688
Why do you think she was reading
you that message, Dr. Gramm?

234
00:19:38,925 --> 00:19:40,084
Dr. Gramm?

235
00:19:40,485 --> 00:19:41,804
Dr. Gramm?

236
00:19:42,084 --> 00:19:43,705
In Dr. Gramm own words...

237
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,884
He analyzes a mental puzzle.

238
00:19:46,123 --> 00:19:48,803
So they're no actual
tangible pieces per say.

239
00:19:49,483 --> 00:19:51,482
He made a guess based
on what happened to Kate.

240
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:55,002
A guess based on his
intuition, a personal bias, ego.

241
00:19:55,202 --> 00:19:58,601
And he sold that fiction lock,
stock and barrel to the jury.

242
00:20:01,161 --> 00:20:02,681
What is it?

243
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,320
The girl that was killed last night...

244
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:14,199
Was Dale Morris. Dale?

245
00:20:16,438 --> 00:20:17,519
Oh, my God.

246
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:21,358
Okay, let's see...

247
00:20:21,677 --> 00:20:24,597
We have our investigators
coordinated with the FBI...

248
00:20:24,797 --> 00:20:29,837
I wanna know everything Dale
Morris did on the last 24 hours.

249
00:20:30,036 --> 00:20:32,316
I wanna know where she
went, who she talked to.

250
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:35,559
Can you please have Dr. Gramm's
car ready, please. Thank you.

251
00:20:37,116 --> 00:20:38,715
Thank you, Shelley.

252
00:20:39,035 --> 00:20:40,195
For what?

253
00:20:41,595 --> 00:20:44,714
I don't know. For everything.
I hate when you do this, Jack.

254
00:20:44,714 --> 00:20:47,596
Every time you o this, I
think you gonna end up dead.

255
00:20:49,594 --> 00:20:51,793
Just don't ask me to marry you again.

256
00:20:51,913 --> 00:20:53,673
Why not? We're perfect for each other.

257
00:20:53,673 --> 00:20:57,512
Yeah, yeah. Except that I'm
gay and you're commitment phobe.

258
00:20:57,711 --> 00:20:59,632
That's why we're perfect.

259
00:21:01,471 --> 00:21:03,071
Thanks, baby.

260
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:08,671
Dr. Gramm is a world known
expert in forensic psychiatry.

261
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:11,469
What is forensic psychiatry?

262
00:21:12,389 --> 00:21:14,909
I mean, is not the same profession
that destroyed MacMorton's life...

263
00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:17,628
By conjuring up images
of child molestation?

264
00:21:17,829 --> 00:21:21,188
None of the charges were ever proved.
And the accused, though innocent...

265
00:21:21,188 --> 00:21:22,629
Was public crucified.

266
00:21:46,384 --> 00:21:48,463
Jack, look. Look at the kite.

267
00:21:51,343 --> 00:21:52,783
Jack, come here.

268
00:22:55,853 --> 00:22:56,973
Yeah?

269
00:22:57,813 --> 00:22:59,253
Hello?

270
00:23:01,654 --> 00:23:03,255
Hello?

271
00:23:03,334 --> 00:23:05,655
You have 88 minutes to live.

272
00:23:05,694 --> 00:23:06,535
What?

273
00:23:06,615 --> 00:23:08,976
You know how long 88
minutes can be, don't you?

274
00:23:08,976 --> 00:23:11,216
That's 11:45 am. Who is this?

275
00:23:11,416 --> 00:23:13,263
Tic-Tac. Who the hell is this?

276
00:23:13,338 --> 00:23:14,698
Tic-Tac.

277
00:23:15,737 --> 00:23:17,179
What were you saying?

278
00:23:32,022 --> 00:23:34,182
Jack Gramm Associates. Shelley?

279
00:23:34,342 --> 00:23:36,703
I want you to set a trap
and and a trace on my cell.

280
00:23:36,703 --> 00:23:37,503
What's going on?

281
00:23:37,503 --> 00:23:40,504
I want you to contact
a wireless carrier...

282
00:23:40,584 --> 00:23:43,144
And have them find out who
made that last phone call to me.

283
00:23:43,144 --> 00:23:45,385
Jack, I could be more
helpful if... Just do it.

284
00:23:45,385 --> 00:23:46,546
Just do it. I need it, all right?

285
00:23:46,546 --> 00:23:48,467
And call me when you get it.

286
00:23:49,507 --> 00:23:54,148
John Forster was an Eagle Scout, which
counts for his facility with ropes.

287
00:23:54,348 --> 00:23:56,646
He also worked in a veterinary office...

288
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:59,909
Where he had experience using the
animal tranquilizer Halothane...

289
00:23:59,909 --> 00:24:01,470
Witch he's used to subdue his victims.

290
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:05,951
Halothane. Sorry, I'm
late again. Thank you, Kim.

291
00:24:06,671 --> 00:24:10,592
I see that the size of our
class is dwindling once again.

292
00:24:10,672 --> 00:24:13,032
It could be because you
keep booting everyone.

293
00:24:13,032 --> 00:24:15,793
My favorite student, Mike Stempt.

294
00:24:17,834 --> 00:24:22,995
Okay. The legal distinction between
sanity and insanity rests upon what?

295
00:24:23,235 --> 00:24:26,197
Free will. The concept of the free will.

296
00:24:26,477 --> 00:24:29,317
And what is the most important thing...

297
00:24:29,477 --> 00:24:31,958
One should remember when
entering a court-Room?

298
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:35,832
That insanity it's a legal concept.
It's not a medical or psychiatric term.

299
00:24:35,838 --> 00:24:37,999
But despite the fact that
insanity is a legal concept...

300
00:24:37,999 --> 00:24:39,599
It doesn't mean that
someone is not sick.

301
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:40,635
Yes, Lauren.

302
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,841
Of all the serial killers that
I've interviewed and studied...

303
00:24:43,841 --> 00:24:47,722
Witch include our boy
Bundy, Dahmer, Gacy...

304
00:24:47,761 --> 00:24:50,122
None of them was legally insane.

305
00:24:50,483 --> 00:24:52,363
This is not saying
that they were normal.

306
00:24:52,363 --> 00:24:54,083
I could argue that they
couldn't help themselves...

307
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:55,604
Precisely because of
their mental disorder.

308
00:24:55,604 --> 00:24:57,804
Well, if you wanna argue, Mike...

309
00:24:58,004 --> 00:24:59,805
School of law is across campus.

310
00:24:59,805 --> 00:25:01,286
Come on, Dr. Gramm.

311
00:25:01,485 --> 00:25:04,806
It's ingenuous to pretend that our
presentations are not arguments.

312
00:25:04,806 --> 00:25:06,887
We create a narrative of
the crime and the criminal.

313
00:25:06,887 --> 00:25:09,528
Narrative is based on
facts. Based on logic.

314
00:25:09,767 --> 00:25:13,101
We don't walk into a court-Room
and advocate set scenes, do we?

315
00:25:13,209 --> 00:25:17,009
We don't take sides. We
check our views at the door.

316
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:19,530
You mean you want us to pretend
we don't have an opinion?

317
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:22,331
We have opinions, Lauren, but
we just keep them to ourselves.

318
00:25:22,331 --> 00:25:24,611
Share them with your
dog, if you have to.

319
00:25:24,611 --> 00:25:27,089
Not with your parrot,
because it talks back.

320
00:25:27,612 --> 00:25:30,733
It is that kind of logic that's gonna
get you in a law school across campus.

321
00:25:30,733 --> 00:25:32,213
I've been there. I've done that.

322
00:25:32,213 --> 00:25:34,094
Well, my condolences.

323
00:25:35,374 --> 00:25:37,215
So, where is...

324
00:25:37,454 --> 00:25:40,416
Dale Morris? She's
absent. I don't see her.

325
00:25:43,096 --> 00:25:44,657
That's her first.

326
00:25:48,458 --> 00:25:50,395
I didn't take her for a quitter.

327
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:55,539
Anyone who has her phone number,
please, contact me after class.

328
00:25:59,341 --> 00:26:00,821
Okay.

329
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,982
Excuse me.

330
00:26:05,702 --> 00:26:06,501
Shelley.

331
00:26:06,501 --> 00:26:10,584
Tick-Tack, doc. You have 83
minutes to live, Dr. Gramm.

332
00:26:11,943 --> 00:26:13,504
Tick-Tack, doc.

333
00:26:24,427 --> 00:26:26,267
So where was I?

334
00:26:26,467 --> 00:26:28,228
Bundy versus Forster.

335
00:26:28,428 --> 00:26:30,549
What? Bundy versus Forster.

336
00:26:31,669 --> 00:26:32,975
Thank you, Lauren.

337
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,241
You're welcome.

338
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:44,072
What we're gonna explore today is the
similarities and dissimilarities...

339
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:49,274
Say, from Ted Bundy's motives, let's
compared them to John Forster's.

340
00:26:54,915 --> 00:26:56,897
Dr. Gramm, your phone is ringing.

341
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:06,357
Jack, are you there?
Shelley. What's going on?

342
00:27:06,357 --> 00:27:08,118
The call was made from a cell phone.

343
00:27:08,118 --> 00:27:10,399
One of those you buy
and pay minutes for it.

344
00:27:10,399 --> 00:27:11,559
Registered to whom?

345
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:15,028
Look, I know you're in class,
but... Yes, who is registered to it?

346
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:17,682
A Kate Gramm.

347
00:27:21,722 --> 00:27:24,562
Jack, it's a common name. It
doesn't have to be your sister.

348
00:27:24,562 --> 00:27:26,139
It's just a coincidence.

349
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:29,095
It's not a coincidence.

350
00:27:31,645 --> 00:27:34,406
It's not a coincidence.
Jack, I'm loosing you.

351
00:27:34,645 --> 00:27:36,206
Shelley? Goddamn it!

352
00:27:36,805 --> 00:27:37,661
Shelley?

353
00:27:37,726 --> 00:27:40,745
Have you found out who my
phone is registered to by now?

354
00:27:40,767 --> 00:27:44,087
Poor Kate. If it was Kate,
you'd like to call her?

355
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:46,848
I'm gonna find you, you here
that, you son-Of-A-Bitch?

356
00:27:46,848 --> 00:27:49,371
You're barking up the
wrong tree on this one.

357
00:27:49,409 --> 00:27:50,761
I'm gonna find you.

358
00:27:50,929 --> 00:27:52,970
She suffered for such a long time.

359
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,792
You remember how long, don't you?

360
00:27:56,252 --> 00:27:58,189
You still feel guilty about her?

361
00:27:58,692 --> 00:28:01,572
You feel guilty about
falsifying the evidence?

362
00:28:01,612 --> 00:28:03,733
For lying under oath?

363
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:07,374
Tic-Tac, doc. You have
79 minutes to live.

364
00:28:37,262 --> 00:28:39,182
Do you find this funny, Albert?

365
00:28:39,341 --> 00:28:41,414
Who were you calling on your phone?

366
00:28:42,543 --> 00:28:44,029
Let me see your phone.

367
00:28:44,304 --> 00:28:45,584
I was just...

368
00:28:45,823 --> 00:28:47,184
Let me see that goddamn it phone.

369
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:48,624
I was just checking the Mariners score.

370
00:28:48,624 --> 00:28:50,905
You were what? I was
checking the Mariners score.

371
00:28:50,905 --> 00:28:52,506
Okay, what is the score?

372
00:28:54,025 --> 00:28:54,986
The score.

373
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:56,867
What's the damn score?

374
00:28:58,787 --> 00:29:01,188
It's 3 x 1 Mariners. B1.

375
00:29:33,756 --> 00:29:36,477
Oh, my God, I can't believe it. What
does it mean? What's the problem?

376
00:29:36,477 --> 00:29:37,758
Look.

377
00:29:37,838 --> 00:29:38,678
What?

378
00:29:39,478 --> 00:29:40,598
What's going on here?

379
00:29:40,598 --> 00:29:43,359
It says that Dale Morris
was murdered last night.

380
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,520
Is that true, Dr. Gramm? Yeah.

381
00:29:46,801 --> 00:29:49,720
You knew it? You knew it
and you didn't tell us?

382
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,894
You knew and asked for Dale's
number? Is it the slayer?

383
00:29:53,081 --> 00:29:54,882
It could be. It could be?

384
00:29:55,122 --> 00:29:57,402
Well, the police haven't
released any information yet.

385
00:29:57,402 --> 00:29:59,883
Are we all in danger? I can't
believe you didn't tell us.

386
00:29:59,883 --> 00:30:02,243
Dr. Gramm? Lynn Johnson.

387
00:30:02,403 --> 00:30:04,164
Someone just called a bomb threat.

388
00:30:04,164 --> 00:30:07,246
Everyone is to evacuate the
building immediately. Thank you.

389
00:30:07,246 --> 00:30:09,326
Come on. Grab your stuff.

390
00:30:09,525 --> 00:30:12,047
I'll get your papers
of presentation, Tom.

391
00:30:12,246 --> 00:30:13,887
I got the slides, Kim.

392
00:30:17,408 --> 00:30:21,649
All students, faculty and staff
must evacuate the building.

393
00:30:21,728 --> 00:30:24,810
I repeat. Everyone must
evacuate the building.

394
00:30:33,372 --> 00:30:37,534
All students, faculty and staff
must evacuate the building.

395
00:30:37,773 --> 00:30:40,814
I repeat. Everyone must
evacuate the building.

396
00:30:44,135 --> 00:30:46,896
Please, remain calm e do not run.

397
00:30:46,976 --> 00:30:49,777
Proceed to the door to
the end of the campus.

398
00:30:50,256 --> 00:30:53,297
I repeat. We must evacuate the building.

399
00:30:54,377 --> 00:30:57,098
Jack? What are you doing? Get going.

400
00:30:58,579 --> 00:31:03,381
All students, faculty and staff
must evacuate the building.

401
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,181
What was that on the screen?

402
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:10,421
Some student playing
a joke or something.

403
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:14,102
You of all people know that it breaks
school laws to proceed by a threat...

404
00:31:14,102 --> 00:31:17,256
You need to report this to the
campus security immediately.

405
00:31:17,263 --> 00:31:20,984
Carol. I get threat like this,
three or four times a year.

406
00:31:21,065 --> 00:31:24,065
Your incredible arrogance will
slap the shit of you, Jack.

407
00:31:24,065 --> 00:31:26,427
I wish you'd disclosure your
true feelings about me...

408
00:31:26,427 --> 00:31:27,946
Before we became such good friends.

409
00:31:27,946 --> 00:31:30,467
Maybe you should stop hiding behind
your assessments about other people...

410
00:31:30,467 --> 00:31:31,547
And start assessing yourself...

411
00:31:31,547 --> 00:31:33,467
Cause you need to get over your
past and go on with your life...

412
00:31:33,467 --> 00:31:35,468
Cause what you're living isn't one.

413
00:31:35,468 --> 00:31:37,676
It is not what you tell your patients?

414
00:31:38,669 --> 00:31:40,510
Gum? Thank you.

415
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:43,151
I'll call campus security and
let them know you're on your way.

416
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,944
Where did you go last
night? When you left the bar.

417
00:31:47,952 --> 00:31:48,951
Home.

418
00:31:49,352 --> 00:31:50,992
Were you alone?

419
00:31:51,752 --> 00:31:53,593
Screw you.

420
00:32:11,357 --> 00:32:12,838
Roger. We're on it.

421
00:32:23,201 --> 00:32:23,922
Yeah.

422
00:32:24,001 --> 00:32:26,881
The press got a hold of Dale's
name. It's all over the news.

423
00:32:26,881 --> 00:32:28,362
Yeah, I know that.

424
00:32:29,562 --> 00:32:32,924
And Forster's attorney is going
to the court and try a stay.

425
00:32:33,323 --> 00:32:35,284
A stay? On what grounds?

426
00:32:35,565 --> 00:32:36,924
They're claiming that these...

427
00:32:36,924 --> 00:32:39,605
Murders prove that the real killer
have never been brought to justice.

428
00:32:39,605 --> 00:32:42,765
Nonsense. They're just trying
to buy time. They're desperate.

429
00:32:42,765 --> 00:32:46,326
They're also claiming that you falsify
testimony and concealed evidences.

430
00:32:46,326 --> 00:32:48,647
Well, it's all loose. Goddamn it.

431
00:32:49,447 --> 00:32:51,329
Who is that guy?

432
00:32:54,329 --> 00:32:57,610
What about Dale Morris?
Did we find anymore of her?

433
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:01,010
She was murdered in her apartment...

434
00:33:01,091 --> 00:33:03,092
Between the hours of two and six am.

435
00:33:03,092 --> 00:33:04,848
Any sign of force entry? No.

436
00:33:04,851 --> 00:33:08,332
Does Forster still have that
group visiting him on prison?

437
00:33:08,932 --> 00:33:11,494
He's like a goddamn rock
star. Website and all.

438
00:33:11,494 --> 00:33:14,454
I want you to pull a background
check on all my students...

439
00:33:14,454 --> 00:33:15,934
And get back to me.

440
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:18,416
Damn.

441
00:33:22,016 --> 00:33:22,976
Oh, no.

442
00:34:04,387 --> 00:34:05,667
Okay.

443
00:35:01,482 --> 00:35:03,722
Kim? What are you doing here?

444
00:35:03,803 --> 00:35:05,562
I'm getting my car, it's parked here...

445
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:07,905
Like it's every day
I come to the campus.

446
00:35:08,724 --> 00:35:12,684
That was really horrible. Just
horrible what you did in class...

447
00:35:12,765 --> 00:35:15,126
It's was little low for you. I
was looking for potential suspects.

448
00:35:15,126 --> 00:35:18,326
That's what I was doing. What did you
do after you left the party last night?

449
00:35:18,326 --> 00:35:21,254
I didn't end up drunk in
bed with an strange like you.

450
00:35:21,368 --> 00:35:25,287
You left the party with Dale Morris,
the girl that was murdered, didn't you?

451
00:35:26,009 --> 00:35:28,929
Yes, I did. So what did
you do? Where did you go?

452
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:32,210
You're not seriously considering...

453
00:35:33,491 --> 00:35:34,650
Where did you go?

454
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:37,651
We went to the Hickory Stick.
We had a drink, two drinks.

455
00:35:37,651 --> 00:35:40,012
And then? And then I went home alone.

456
00:35:40,853 --> 00:35:44,186
You have anyone that can verify
that? No. No-One can verify it.

457
00:35:44,333 --> 00:35:45,814
Come on. I've been your
teaching assistant for two years.

458
00:35:45,814 --> 00:35:48,697
I'm your friend. I'm here
to help you, if you let me.

459
00:35:48,735 --> 00:35:50,136
Follow me.

460
00:35:53,096 --> 00:35:54,736
Follow me.

461
00:35:58,377 --> 00:35:59,777
Who did that?

462
00:36:01,018 --> 00:36:02,414
What does that mean?

463
00:36:02,418 --> 00:36:04,418
According to a anonymous phone call...

464
00:36:04,418 --> 00:36:07,339
That means I have 72
minutes left to live.

465
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,620
Can I borrow your cell phone?

466
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,221
I've broke mine.

467
00:36:12,301 --> 00:36:13,421
These are my car keys.

468
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,862
Can you take that around front
and meet me there in ten minutes?

469
00:36:15,862 --> 00:36:18,903
I have to go to the
campus security. Okay.

470
00:36:18,982 --> 00:36:21,224
Call me on my Blackberry
if you run late.

471
00:36:21,224 --> 00:36:22,102
Okay.

472
00:36:23,783 --> 00:36:27,105
Shelley. You gonna have to
reach me on Kim's cell phone.

473
00:36:27,305 --> 00:36:28,185
What happened to yours?

474
00:36:28,185 --> 00:36:29,906
I broke it. What?

475
00:36:30,065 --> 00:36:31,626
You have her number, don't you?

476
00:36:31,626 --> 00:36:32,426
Yeah, I do.

477
00:36:32,426 --> 00:36:37,148
Listen, just forward all the
calls, okay, to Kim's cell.

478
00:36:38,027 --> 00:36:39,267
Please, thanks.

479
00:36:39,547 --> 00:36:40,948
Dr. Gramm.

480
00:36:41,509 --> 00:36:42,455
Hey, Mike.

481
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:46,790
Everyone is pretty upset about Dale.

482
00:36:46,949 --> 00:36:50,670
Yeah, well, that's understandable.
Considering the circumstances.

483
00:36:51,111 --> 00:36:53,151
I have a question about John Forster.

484
00:36:53,151 --> 00:36:54,792
Yeah? What?

485
00:36:55,433 --> 00:36:59,172
Well, I've been going through the
trial transcripts in Kate's history...

486
00:36:59,193 --> 00:37:00,673
Why would you do that?

487
00:37:00,673 --> 00:37:04,314
To understand your process better.
How you come to your conclusions.

488
00:37:05,354 --> 00:37:06,275
And?

489
00:37:06,994 --> 00:37:08,195
What?

490
00:37:09,396 --> 00:37:11,957
Is it possible that Forster is innocent?

491
00:37:12,037 --> 00:37:12,917
No.

492
00:37:13,316 --> 00:37:15,317
You won't even consider the possibility?

493
00:37:15,317 --> 00:37:16,237
No.

494
00:37:16,437 --> 00:37:20,199
You're completely convinced the scenario
you put together is the only one?

495
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:22,811
First of all, I didn't
put together a scenario.

496
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,359
I recreated the crime scene. Second...

497
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,720
I didn't convict Forster. A jury did.

498
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,321
But the evidence was circumstantial.

499
00:37:29,321 --> 00:37:31,041
No DNA, no murder weapon.

500
00:37:31,201 --> 00:37:34,722
Nothing directly linking Forster to
the crime, except your narrative...

501
00:37:34,722 --> 00:37:37,245
And Janie Kay's testimony.
What's your point?

502
00:37:37,804 --> 00:37:39,964
Just that your testimony
was very convincing.

503
00:37:39,964 --> 00:37:41,525
That's my job.

504
00:37:41,564 --> 00:37:43,204
To be convincing.

505
00:37:45,405 --> 00:37:47,325
I thought it was to be right.

506
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:01,049
Help!

507
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,530
Somebody, please!

508
00:38:08,451 --> 00:38:09,531
Help!

509
00:38:09,771 --> 00:38:11,012
Help!

510
00:38:15,213 --> 00:38:16,293
Lauren. Dr. Gramm.

511
00:38:16,293 --> 00:38:17,253
What happened to you?

512
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:19,174
He's wearing a leather
jacket. He's out there.

513
00:38:19,174 --> 00:38:22,135
I bit his hand, it's bleeding. If
his hand is bloody, you can get him.

514
00:38:22,135 --> 00:38:25,255
You're okay? Go get him now! I'm fine!

515
00:38:55,983 --> 00:38:58,184
Watch my car! It's a police action!

516
00:38:58,424 --> 00:38:59,344
There's been an assault.

517
00:38:59,344 --> 00:39:01,105
I wanna see your hands. Back off!

518
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:02,727
Roll the window down. No!

519
00:39:02,746 --> 00:39:05,866
I'm a forensic psychiatric
with the FBI. Here.

520
00:39:06,106 --> 00:39:07,773
Okay? Open the window now.

521
00:39:07,866 --> 00:39:10,164
Yeah. See? Well, roll down the window...

522
00:39:10,347 --> 00:39:13,050
And let me see your hands.
Let me see your hands.

523
00:39:13,228 --> 00:39:15,509
If you have nothing to
hide, you can show me.

524
00:39:15,509 --> 00:39:17,536
Look, I'm trying to go home. What?

525
00:39:18,549 --> 00:39:20,150
Okay, sorry.

526
00:39:26,472 --> 00:39:27,592
Excuse me.

527
00:39:27,672 --> 00:39:30,285
There's been an assault.
I wanna see your hand.

528
00:39:36,994 --> 00:39:38,795
Okay. Be cool now!

529
00:39:40,075 --> 00:39:42,236
There's been an assault.
I gotta check your hands.

530
00:39:42,236 --> 00:39:44,957
I'm a forensic psychiatric with the FBI.

531
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,040
Sorry.

532
00:40:10,883 --> 00:40:12,279
I couldn't find him.

533
00:40:12,603 --> 00:40:13,724
Here.

534
00:40:14,764 --> 00:40:16,444
This is stupid.

535
00:40:17,205 --> 00:40:18,325
I'm so stupid.

536
00:40:18,325 --> 00:40:21,486
How I could be so weak? Such a
wimp. It's not your fault. Come on.

537
00:40:21,486 --> 00:40:24,367
I can't believe I let him get away
like that. I should've fought back more.

538
00:40:24,367 --> 00:40:26,728
Stop beating yourself
up? What exactly happened?

539
00:40:26,728 --> 00:40:29,968
He came from behind. He put this
rag over my mouth and I bit his hand.

540
00:40:29,968 --> 00:40:32,648
The rag had an odor? Something sweet...

541
00:40:33,769 --> 00:40:35,255
It's Halothane, right?

542
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:37,250
Yeah. He's the one.

543
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:38,810
Probably.

544
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:40,651
I let Dale's murderer get away.

545
00:40:40,651 --> 00:40:43,052
Stop beating yourself
up and tell me something.

546
00:40:43,052 --> 00:40:46,132
Tell me something. Could you
identify him if you saw him again?

547
00:40:46,132 --> 00:40:48,452
He came from behind, I didn't see him.

548
00:40:51,213 --> 00:40:54,412
Let's go to the campus security,
you'll tell the everything.

549
00:41:01,537 --> 00:41:02,696
Hello.

550
00:41:03,016 --> 00:41:05,043
This woman has just been attacked.

551
00:41:05,138 --> 00:41:06,577
Are you okay?

552
00:41:06,778 --> 00:41:07,859
I think so.

553
00:41:08,058 --> 00:41:09,338
What's your name?

554
00:41:10,459 --> 00:41:11,939
Lauren Douglas.

555
00:41:12,459 --> 00:41:13,675
And who are you?

556
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,059
Jack Gramm.

557
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,461
The famous Dr. Jack Gramm?

558
00:41:17,741 --> 00:41:19,461
Then Johnson Fonsen
have you be coming in.

559
00:41:19,461 --> 00:41:22,461
Is there someone to interview
Miss Douglas now, please?

560
00:41:23,222 --> 00:41:24,262
Jimmy? Yeah.

561
00:41:24,342 --> 00:41:26,863
You wanna check out
this girl? Wait a minute.

562
00:41:26,863 --> 00:41:28,062
Right this way.

563
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:35,185
What's going on here?

564
00:41:35,505 --> 00:41:37,746
The person who attacked her
may still be on the campus.

565
00:41:37,746 --> 00:41:38,746
What the hell you guys doing?

566
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,226
We got all these guys
out on the bomb squad.

567
00:41:41,386 --> 00:41:43,908
Excuse me for one moment. It's
a little crazy around here.

568
00:41:43,908 --> 00:41:46,669
Jimmy, get off the phone and
interview Miss. Douglas, please.

569
00:41:46,669 --> 00:41:48,065
I'll be right there.

570
00:41:50,909 --> 00:41:52,486
Why won't you seat here?

571
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:57,191
Okay, you okay?

572
00:42:00,031 --> 00:42:02,111
Jack Gramm Associates.
Shelley? Get Frank...

573
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,872
And pass him through
when you get him. Okay.

574
00:42:03,872 --> 00:42:05,089
Okay, thank you.

575
00:42:05,792 --> 00:42:09,622
I don't want you going back to your
apartment until the locks are changed.

576
00:42:09,794 --> 00:42:11,776
I don't have anywhere else to go.

577
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:15,356
After you talk to the officer here...

578
00:42:15,796 --> 00:42:18,877
Go back to my office. Shelley
will find a place to stay.

579
00:42:18,917 --> 00:42:19,717
Okay.

580
00:42:19,917 --> 00:42:23,566
Come on. It's gonna be all right.
Sorry for all the troubles I caused.

581
00:42:26,918 --> 00:42:28,765
Miss. Douglas. Right this way.

582
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:31,720
Right in here. I'm sorry.

583
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,120
Yeah? I left a word for Frank.

584
00:42:36,322 --> 00:42:38,642
Okay. There's been another incident.

585
00:42:38,881 --> 00:42:41,269
The Forster's case
it's your thing, right?

586
00:42:41,322 --> 00:42:42,944
Wrong, it's not my thing.

587
00:42:43,123 --> 00:42:45,604
I saw your testimony on Court TV.

588
00:42:45,644 --> 00:42:46,680
Yeah, right?

589
00:42:47,243 --> 00:42:48,415
Fill those out.

590
00:42:49,925 --> 00:42:52,645
Yeah, I follow the big crime cases.

591
00:42:52,844 --> 00:42:54,151
They fascinate me.

592
00:42:54,326 --> 00:42:56,927
When Dr. Jack Gramm takes the stand.

593
00:42:57,887 --> 00:43:00,320
You come up with things
I didn't think off.

594
00:43:02,768 --> 00:43:06,568
This here, this is just a job until...
Until you pass the police's exam.

595
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:08,650
See? How did you know that?

596
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:10,090
Just a guess.

597
00:43:10,289 --> 00:43:11,771
That's the thing about you.

598
00:43:11,771 --> 00:43:14,291
You know how to put two plus
two and you make it four.

599
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:15,172
Or five.

600
00:43:15,731 --> 00:43:17,578
There are times that you know.

601
00:43:17,652 --> 00:43:20,813
I'm not gonna be a campus cop
to a bunch of snob rich kids.

602
00:43:21,013 --> 00:43:22,173
Especially these rich bitches...

603
00:43:22,173 --> 00:43:26,094
My car is been analyzed.
The window was smashed.

604
00:43:26,414 --> 00:43:29,135
There's a number on
the body. Look into it.

605
00:43:29,736 --> 00:43:30,976
Dr. Gramm?

606
00:43:34,176 --> 00:43:35,617
Dr. Gramm?

607
00:43:39,738 --> 00:43:42,219
This is Johnny D'Franco,
from campus security.

608
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:44,298
Can you get me Lynn Johnson?

609
00:43:44,859 --> 00:43:46,819
Jack Gramm Associates. Shelley?

610
00:43:46,939 --> 00:43:49,860
Did you find Frank? No, not
yet. What the hell is going on?

611
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:54,582
Well, I received a threaten phone
call saying I have 88 minutes to live.

612
00:43:55,181 --> 00:43:57,583
11:45h this morning, and my time is up.

613
00:43:57,863 --> 00:43:59,903
Pull out my risk assessment file.

614
00:44:00,102 --> 00:44:02,224
Anybody rating "e" and above...

615
00:44:02,384 --> 00:44:04,952
I want you to cross
reference against Forster.

616
00:44:05,384 --> 00:44:07,051
And when you find Frank...

617
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:11,346
Ask him if Sara Pollard or any of my
students ever visit Forster in prison.

618
00:44:11,706 --> 00:44:13,426
Sara Pollard?

619
00:44:13,627 --> 00:44:16,267
She's the girl I met
at the party last night.

620
00:44:17,587 --> 00:44:18,868
Call Wong Lee...

621
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:21,509
And have him make a list
of all the phone numbers...

622
00:44:21,509 --> 00:44:23,510
Forster called on the last 72 hours.

623
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:25,177
Where should fax the list?

624
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:26,790
My apartment.

625
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:28,831
And run a check on Kim.

626
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,266
Kim?

627
00:44:32,351 --> 00:44:34,792
Yeah, just do it, okay? Hello.

628
00:44:35,433 --> 00:44:36,154
Jack.

629
00:44:36,953 --> 00:44:38,913
Damn it. The car is out front.

630
00:44:38,994 --> 00:44:40,674
Drive Squaid. Good.

631
00:44:40,874 --> 00:44:42,314
You're okay? You look
a little freaked out.

632
00:44:42,314 --> 00:44:43,394
Yeah. You have...

633
00:44:43,394 --> 00:44:45,557
A battery for your phone? Yeah, I do.

634
00:44:49,196 --> 00:44:51,116
What the hell is this?
What are you doing?

635
00:44:51,116 --> 00:44:53,197
Goddamn it, what is this?

636
00:44:53,437 --> 00:44:54,677
What are you doing with
a gun in your purse?

637
00:44:54,677 --> 00:44:56,439
Jesus, why don't you just
announce to the world?

638
00:44:56,439 --> 00:44:58,598
I don't think they've heard
you in English Department.

639
00:44:58,598 --> 00:45:00,580
Why the gun, Kim? For protection.

640
00:45:00,878 --> 00:45:03,852
Where did you get it? I have
a permit. My dad is a cop.

641
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,681
Why you need a gun? I
don't. My dad thinks I do.

642
00:45:06,841 --> 00:45:08,000
Why?

643
00:45:08,081 --> 00:45:10,362
I have a crazy ex boyfriend, okay, Jack?

644
00:45:10,362 --> 00:45:11,602
Oh. Jesus. God.

645
00:45:11,841 --> 00:45:14,442
Yeah, I really know
how to pick one or what?

646
00:45:14,482 --> 00:45:16,724
The judge said if he threats
anyone he goes back to jail.

647
00:45:16,724 --> 00:45:18,963
Back to jail? What jail?

648
00:45:19,204 --> 00:45:21,844
Prison, actually. Walla Walla.

649
00:45:24,446 --> 00:45:26,125
That's where Forster is.

650
00:45:28,366 --> 00:45:29,673
Come on, let's go.

651
00:45:30,007 --> 00:45:31,807
Special Agent Parks.

652
00:45:31,967 --> 00:45:33,167
Frank, it's Jack.

653
00:45:33,167 --> 00:45:36,448
I'm at the university
campus. We got a problem here.

654
00:45:36,528 --> 00:45:40,089
Someone attacked one of my students and
tried to knock her out with Halothane.

655
00:45:40,089 --> 00:45:43,371
That's the Seattle
slayer. I know, hold on.

656
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:44,871
Give me a second.

657
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:50,251
Yeah. There's a security guard on
this campus, his name is D'Franco.

658
00:45:50,452 --> 00:45:52,479
I don't like him. He's suspicious.

659
00:45:52,573 --> 00:45:54,653
I want you to take him
in for questioning, okay?

660
00:45:54,653 --> 00:45:57,173
Also get a warrant and search his place.

661
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:58,374
Jesus Christ, Jack.

662
00:45:58,374 --> 00:46:01,215
You know I can't just get a
warrant without sufficient grounds.

663
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:03,215
Just get a warrant, Frank, come on.

664
00:46:03,215 --> 00:46:05,062
Do you think he is the slayer?

665
00:46:05,335 --> 00:46:08,176
To link Forster on the
outside? It's possible.

666
00:46:08,417 --> 00:46:12,057
Listen, I checked the names
that Shelley, of the students.

667
00:46:12,337 --> 00:46:16,076
And there's no record of Lauren
Douglas, Kim Cummings or Sara Pollard...

668
00:46:16,099 --> 00:46:17,219
But you gonna love this.

669
00:46:17,219 --> 00:46:21,660
Mike Stempt visit Forster four
times over the last six weeks.

670
00:46:22,141 --> 00:46:24,123
Mike Stempt. What was his reason?

671
00:46:24,301 --> 00:46:26,418
Research. He had written permission.

672
00:46:26,421 --> 00:46:28,622
No, no, no. I didn't
give him any permission.

673
00:46:28,622 --> 00:46:30,063
Written or otherwise.

674
00:46:30,222 --> 00:46:33,286
Well, it's your signature,
Jack. I got a copy right here.

675
00:46:34,463 --> 00:46:36,184
Hold on. That... Hold on a second.

676
00:46:36,184 --> 00:46:38,385
That ex boyfriend of
yours. What is his name?

677
00:46:38,385 --> 00:46:39,745
Guy LaForge.

678
00:46:39,985 --> 00:46:42,546
Run a check on a parole
named Guy LaForge.

679
00:46:42,746 --> 00:46:45,426
He served time at Walla
Walla with Forster.

680
00:46:45,746 --> 00:46:48,467
And I'll call you back
when I get to my apartment.

681
00:46:48,467 --> 00:46:49,828
All right.

682
00:46:51,428 --> 00:46:53,148
Do you think that Frank
is working with Forster?

683
00:46:53,148 --> 00:46:54,389
Someone is.

684
00:46:54,549 --> 00:46:56,389
I got you Johnson. Yeah.

685
00:46:57,068 --> 00:46:59,270
They've found a backpack
in your lecture hall.

686
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:00,847
What? With a bomb in it?

687
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:04,872
No. A photo, dynamite, and a
time with a note addressed to you.

688
00:47:05,071 --> 00:47:06,151
What did it say?

689
00:47:06,151 --> 00:47:07,313
Tic-Tac.

690
00:47:08,912 --> 00:47:10,193
What does it mean, Jack?

691
00:47:10,193 --> 00:47:11,713
I call you back.

692
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,200
You are okay? Yeah.

693
00:47:37,439 --> 00:47:39,120
What the hell was that?

694
00:47:40,601 --> 00:47:42,763
Probably somebody trying to scare us.

695
00:47:42,841 --> 00:47:45,409
Who do you think would
do something like that?

696
00:47:46,123 --> 00:47:48,522
Does your boyfriend drive a motorcycle?

697
00:47:48,764 --> 00:47:50,004
Yeah.

698
00:47:50,203 --> 00:47:52,684
Except he's not my boyfriend anymore.

699
00:47:53,405 --> 00:47:54,125
Yeah.

700
00:47:54,365 --> 00:47:57,245
How does it feel to know you
won't live through another night?

701
00:47:57,245 --> 00:47:58,366
56 minutes.

702
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:00,566
Tic-Tac, doc.

703
00:48:02,246 --> 00:48:03,406
Let's go.

704
00:48:49,338 --> 00:48:50,859
Guy LaForge.

705
00:48:51,299 --> 00:48:53,100
He isn't a boyfriend, is he?

706
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:58,381
The only thing that got me out
of Texas was my books marks.

707
00:48:59,461 --> 00:49:02,742
And when I left for college,
I had that, but not much else.

708
00:49:02,822 --> 00:49:06,183
So I tried to fit in. I drank too much.

709
00:49:07,823 --> 00:49:09,304
Thought too little.

710
00:49:09,944 --> 00:49:11,625
And I met Guy.

711
00:49:15,025 --> 00:49:16,946
And he was this English...

712
00:49:17,466 --> 00:49:19,947
Working class rock star wanna be.

713
00:49:20,027 --> 00:49:21,827
And I fell for him.

714
00:49:23,028 --> 00:49:24,788
And I married him...

715
00:49:24,868 --> 00:49:26,389
When I graduated.

716
00:49:27,829 --> 00:49:31,790
He didn't take to well to my
aspirations for higher education.

717
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:35,911
In fact he didn't really want me to
leave the house. And when I disobeyed...

718
00:49:35,911 --> 00:49:38,711
He got filthy drunk and he beat me.

719
00:49:39,192 --> 00:49:41,673
That's when he got
arrested and I divorced him.

720
00:49:41,673 --> 00:49:44,556
I've been trying to make
up for lost time ever since.

721
00:49:49,755 --> 00:49:52,998
You know, Forster is trying to
kill me. Forster is in prison.

722
00:49:53,035 --> 00:49:56,144
Yeah, I know. He's got someone
on the outside trying to...

723
00:49:56,516 --> 00:49:58,077
To do the job.

724
00:50:01,077 --> 00:50:02,558
He's gonna kill me.

725
00:50:04,077 --> 00:50:05,918
If I don't get him first.

726
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,881
Whoever is working with
Forster must be close to you.

727
00:50:13,881 --> 00:50:17,122
A friend even. I don't
have many friends.

728
00:50:17,322 --> 00:50:18,442
That's a plus.

729
00:50:18,442 --> 00:50:21,763
It's a real pleasure to look at everyone
you know as your would be murderer.

730
00:50:21,763 --> 00:50:24,123
Paranoia is a normal state of mind, huh?

731
00:50:25,724 --> 00:50:26,844
Where is Errol?

732
00:50:26,844 --> 00:50:29,605
I don't know. I'm a
temp. The agency sent me.

733
00:50:30,205 --> 00:50:31,645
Dr. Gramm?

734
00:50:32,086 --> 00:50:33,766
There's a package for you.

735
00:50:37,126 --> 00:50:38,727
How did you know my name?

736
00:50:38,727 --> 00:50:41,168
I don't. It was a question.

737
00:50:42,728 --> 00:50:43,849
Yeah.

738
00:50:44,688 --> 00:50:47,031
There's no returning
address on this? No.

739
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:49,890
Who delivered it?

740
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:53,251
A carrier. But there was another
person here at the same time...

741
00:50:53,251 --> 00:50:55,332
Iooking for you. Who?

742
00:50:55,571 --> 00:50:57,824
What was his name? No, I didn't get it.

743
00:50:57,892 --> 00:51:00,253
When he walked in I was on
the phone with the plumber.

744
00:51:00,253 --> 00:51:05,294
He said he would be right back. Okay.

745
00:51:05,375 --> 00:51:06,975
You wanna me pull the
surveillance tapes?

746
00:51:06,975 --> 00:51:10,849
That shouldn't take more than an hour
to get someone up here with the keys.

747
00:51:11,537 --> 00:51:13,176
I don't have an hour. No?

748
00:51:13,417 --> 00:51:18,018
Hey, you know, he was also wearing
leathers. He had a motorcycle helmet.

749
00:51:18,218 --> 00:51:20,298
That's Guy. He was here.

750
00:51:21,858 --> 00:51:24,819
If he comes back, don't
send him up to my apartment.

751
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:26,659
Yeah.

752
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,300
Hi, Dr. Gramm. Hi, Eva.
