(Bell rings)

2
00:03:08,127 --> 00:03:10,197
MAN: <i>Bow to the board.</i>

3
00:03:12,247 --> 00:03:13,805
This is the boy.

4
00:03:14,807 --> 00:03:16,399
Born here in the workhouse.

5
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:18,597
Moved to the parish farm.

6
00:03:18,647 --> 00:03:20,239
Nine years old today.

7
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:22,323
Time to be moved back here.

8
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:23,846
What's your name, boy?

9
00:03:28,727 --> 00:03:30,319
(Faintly) Oliver Twist.

10
00:03:30,367 --> 00:03:32,164
- What, what?
- The boy's a fool.

11
00:03:32,207 --> 00:03:34,357
Boy, listen to me.

12
00:03:34,407 --> 00:03:37,922
<i>- You know you are an orphan, I suppose?</i>
- What's that?

13
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,639
The boy is a fool. I thought he was.

14
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:43,566
You know you've got no father or mother
and that you were brought up by the parish?

15
00:03:43,607 --> 00:03:45,757
<i>- Don't you?</i>
- Yes, sir.

16
00:03:45,807 --> 00:03:47,399
What are you crying for?

17
00:03:47,447 --> 00:03:49,915
I hope you say your prayers every night, hmm?

18
00:03:49,967 --> 00:03:52,686
Pray for those that feed you
and take care of you.

19
00:03:52,727 --> 00:03:54,319
Like a...

20
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,005
- Like a Christian.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

21
00:03:56,047 --> 00:04:01,485
Well, you have come here to be educated
and to be taught a useful trade.

22
00:04:31,887 --> 00:04:33,559
Learn from the boy next to you.

23
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,518
What am I to learn, sir?

24
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:37,717
Learn to pick out the oakum.

25
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:39,598
What's oakum, sir?

26
00:04:39,647 --> 00:04:42,241
Stop asking so many questions.

27
00:04:42,287 --> 00:04:44,926
Oakum's the fibres you unpick from the old rope.

28
00:04:45,967 --> 00:04:49,164
Then it's used again
for ships of Her Majesty's Navy.

29
00:04:50,167 --> 00:04:51,839
You're serving your country.

30
00:04:51,887 --> 00:04:53,878
Now, get on with it.

31
00:05:26,647 --> 00:05:28,239
Tom, give it a rest, will you?

32
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:29,720
We're trying to sleep.

33
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,243
Can't sleep. Too hungry.

34
00:05:34,287 --> 00:05:35,879
We're all hungry.

35
00:05:35,927 --> 00:05:37,326
<i>Yes, but I'm frightened.</i>

36
00:05:38,327 --> 00:05:39,919
Frightened? Why?

37
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,559
Why?

38
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:45,998
Why? I'm so hungry, I'm frightened I might eat
the lad that sleeps next to me.

39
00:06:20,487 --> 00:06:22,637
MAN: <i>Oh, Lord God,</i>

40
00:06:22,687 --> 00:06:25,679
for the blessing
of this generous and bountiful meal

41
00:06:25,727 --> 00:06:27,524
that thou hast placed before us,

42
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:29,159
we give thanks.

43
00:06:29,207 --> 00:06:30,686
Amen.

44
00:06:30,727 --> 00:06:33,116
ALL: Amen!

45
00:07:09,487 --> 00:07:11,478
(Softly) Yeah.

46
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,561
(Sharp intakes of breath)

47
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:52,720
Please, sir, I want some more.

48
00:07:54,047 --> 00:07:55,639
What?

49
00:07:56,687 --> 00:07:59,076
Please, sir, I want some more.

50
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:11,962
Fetch the Beadle!

51
00:08:20,247 --> 00:08:21,839
Mr Limbkins.

52
00:08:21,887 --> 00:08:23,479
<i>I beg your pardon, sir.</i>

53
00:08:24,607 --> 00:08:27,041
Oliver Twist has asked for more.

54
00:08:28,087 --> 00:08:29,679
For more?

55
00:08:29,727 --> 00:08:32,799
Compose yourself, Mr Bumble,
and answer me distinctly.

56
00:08:32,847 --> 00:08:37,238
Do I understand that he asked for more
<i>after</i> he'd eaten supper?

57
00:08:37,287 --> 00:08:38,640
He did, sir.

58
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:44,362
That boy will be hanged.

59
00:08:51,687 --> 00:08:53,882
Whoa.

60
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,798
£5 and a boy?

61
00:08:57,847 --> 00:08:59,439
Whoa!

62
00:08:59,487 --> 00:09:00,681
Whoa.

63
00:09:01,727 --> 00:09:03,319
When I says whoa...

64
00:09:03,367 --> 00:09:04,959
I means whoa!

65
00:09:05,007 --> 00:09:06,998
(Donkey brays)

66
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,878
(Reads) Healthy,

67
00:09:09,927 --> 00:09:11,519
app...

68
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:13,159
apprentice.

69
00:09:13,207 --> 00:09:15,675
£5.

70
00:09:15,727 --> 00:09:19,083
Chimney sweeping is a nasty trade.

71
00:09:19,127 --> 00:09:23,484
Young boys have been smothered in chimneys
before now.

72
00:09:23,527 --> 00:09:26,758
That's because they damp the straw
afore they light it in the chimney

73
00:09:26,807 --> 00:09:28,399
<i>to make 'em come out again.</i>

74
00:09:29,327 --> 00:09:32,319
Damp straw makes smoke.
Smoke sends the boy to sleep.

75
00:09:32,367 --> 00:09:33,959
That's what he wants.

76
00:09:34,007 --> 00:09:35,679
Boys is very lazy, gentlemen.

77
00:09:35,727 --> 00:09:39,436
But there's nothing like a good, hot blaze
to make 'em come out in a run.

78
00:09:39,487 --> 00:09:41,557
<i>It's humane, too.</i>

79
00:09:41,607 --> 00:09:45,395
Yes. Because even if they're stuck
in the chimney,

80
00:09:45,447 --> 00:09:49,725
roasting their feet makes 'em struggle
to hextricate theirselves.

81
00:09:50,727 --> 00:09:52,160
Yes.

82
00:09:52,207 --> 00:09:54,596
I suppose he's fond of chimney sweeping?

83
00:09:54,647 --> 00:09:56,524
He dotes on it, Your Worship.

84
00:09:56,567 --> 00:09:59,365
<i>Very well. I will sign the indentures...</i>

85
00:10:00,407 --> 00:10:02,716
..to make him Mr...

86
00:10:03,727 --> 00:10:06,719
..Mr Gamfield's apprentice.

87
00:10:08,527 --> 00:10:10,404
(Oliver whimpers)

88
00:10:15,887 --> 00:10:17,479
My boy.

89
00:10:19,447 --> 00:10:22,837
My boy, you look pale and alarmed.

90
00:10:22,887 --> 00:10:24,479
What's the matter?

91
00:10:25,527 --> 00:10:27,836
Please, sir... Please, sir...

92
00:10:27,887 --> 00:10:30,037
What is it, my boy?

93
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,918
OLIVER: <i>Don't...</i>
- Now, then.

94
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:33,559
Don't...

95
00:10:34,607 --> 00:10:37,485
Go on, my boy. Don't what?

96
00:10:37,527 --> 00:10:40,325
Please don't send me away
with this dreadful man, sir.

97
00:10:40,367 --> 00:10:43,404
Huh. Off all the designing orphans
that I've ever seen.

98
00:10:43,447 --> 00:10:45,403
Hold your tongue, Beadle.

99
00:10:45,447 --> 00:10:48,519
- Did Your Worship speak to me?
- Yes. Hold your tongue.

100
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,762
FIRST MAGISTRATE: <i>Out of the question.</i>

101
00:10:52,807 --> 00:10:56,846
We refuse to sanction these indentures.

102
00:10:58,607 --> 00:11:00,199
Take the boy away.

103
00:11:00,247 --> 00:11:02,966
And treat him kindly.

104
00:11:03,007 --> 00:11:04,599
<i>He seems to want it.</i>

105
00:11:21,287 --> 00:11:24,996
I've just taken the measure of the two women
that died last night, Mr Bumble.

106
00:11:25,047 --> 00:11:27,925
MR BUMBLE:
You'll make your fortune, Mr Sowerberry.

107
00:11:27,967 --> 00:11:29,559
Think so?

108
00:11:31,687 --> 00:11:34,520
The prices allowed by the board are very small.

109
00:11:34,567 --> 00:11:36,159
So are the coffins.

110
00:11:38,287 --> 00:11:41,916
By the by, you don't know anybody
who wants a boy, do you?

111
00:11:44,687 --> 00:11:46,598
Liberal terms, Mr Sowerberry.

112
00:11:46,647 --> 00:11:48,444
Liberal terms.

113
00:11:57,407 --> 00:12:02,481
Now, as you are to meet your new master,
pull that cap off your eyes.

114
00:12:03,927 --> 00:12:05,519
Hold your head up, sir.

115
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:10,518
Dry your eyes, sir.

116
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,519
(Bell rings)

117
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,159
Aha.

118
00:12:16,207 --> 00:12:17,799
Is that you, Bumble?

119
00:12:17,847 --> 00:12:20,156
No-one else, Mr Sowerberry.

120
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:23,438
I brought the orphan, Oliver Twist.

121
00:12:23,487 --> 00:12:25,318
So this is the orphan, is it?

122
00:12:26,127 --> 00:12:30,917
Mrs Sowerberry, will you have the goodness
to come here a moment, my dear?

123
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:33,559
Oliver Twist?

124
00:12:33,607 --> 00:12:35,916
How comes an orphan to have any name at all?

125
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,435
- I invented it.
- You, Mr Bumble?

126
00:12:38,487 --> 00:12:40,079
Aye, Mr Sowerberry.

127
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:43,199
I name all our foundlings in alphabetical order.

128
00:12:43,247 --> 00:12:45,556
<i>The last was "S".</i>

129
00:12:45,607 --> 00:12:47,199
"Swubble," I named him.

130
00:12:47,247 --> 00:12:51,286
This was a "T". "Twist," I named him.

131
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,919
Next one as comes will be...

132
00:12:52,967 --> 00:12:55,800
"Unwin". And the next "Vilkins".

133
00:12:55,847 --> 00:12:59,601
I've got names ready all through the alphabet,
right up to "Z".

134
00:12:59,647 --> 00:13:02,525
Why, you're quite a literary character, sir.

135
00:13:02,567 --> 00:13:04,398
MR BUMBLE: Well, well.

136
00:13:04,447 --> 00:13:06,039
Perhaps I may be.

137
00:13:06,087 --> 00:13:10,160
Mrs Sowerberry, this is the orphan
from the workhouse.

138
00:13:12,927 --> 00:13:16,363
- Dear me, he's very small.
- But he'll grow, Mrs Sowerberry. He'll grow.

139
00:13:16,407 --> 00:13:17,999
Yes, I daresay he will...

140
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,639
on <i>our</i> food and drink.

141
00:13:20,647 --> 00:13:23,923
Workhouse boys
always cost more to keep than they're worth.

142
00:13:24,967 --> 00:13:27,242
Get downstairs, you bag of bones.

143
00:13:28,527 --> 00:13:32,884
Here, Charlotte, give this boy some
of the cold bits that were put by for the dog.

144
00:14:01,047 --> 00:14:04,278
MRS SOWERBERRY: You don't mind
sleeping among the coffins, I suppose.

145
00:14:04,327 --> 00:14:08,036
It doesn't matter much whether you do or don't.
You can't sleep anywhere else.

146
00:15:20,007 --> 00:15:21,645
(Cock crows)

147
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,279
(Banging)

148
00:15:24,287 --> 00:15:25,879
BOY: <i>Open the door, will ya?</i>

149
00:15:36,087 --> 00:15:37,679
<i>Are you the new boy?</i>

150
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,319
Yes, sir.

151
00:15:39,367 --> 00:15:40,959
<i>How old are you?</i>

152
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:42,599
Ten, sir.

153
00:15:42,647 --> 00:15:45,764
<i>Then I'll whop you one when I get in,</i>
<i>you workhouse brat.</i>

154
00:15:50,687 --> 00:15:52,279
(Cock crows)

155
00:16:02,687 --> 00:16:04,757
I beg your pardon, sir. Did you knock?

156
00:16:04,807 --> 00:16:06,399
I kicked.

157
00:16:06,447 --> 00:16:08,039
Did you want a coffin, sir?

158
00:16:09,087 --> 00:16:11,601
- You don't know who I am, I suppose?
- No, sir.

159
00:16:11,647 --> 00:16:13,444
Well, I'm Mr Noah Claypole.

160
00:16:13,487 --> 00:16:15,079
And you're under me.

161
00:16:15,127 --> 00:16:16,719
Now, take down the shutters!

162
00:16:22,287 --> 00:16:26,166
Saved a nice little bit of bacon for you
from the master's breakfast.

163
00:16:30,487 --> 00:16:32,079
In the corner with you.

164
00:16:32,127 --> 00:16:33,719
And be quick about it.

165
00:16:33,767 --> 00:16:35,644
They want you to mind the shop.

166
00:16:35,687 --> 00:16:37,279
Do you hear?

167
00:16:37,327 --> 00:16:39,443
Do you hear, Workhouse? In the corner.

168
00:16:39,487 --> 00:16:41,603
CHARLOTTE: <i>O, Lor', Noah, let the boy alone.</i>

169
00:16:41,647 --> 00:16:43,239
Let him alone?

170
00:16:43,287 --> 00:16:45,084
Why, everybody's let him alone.

171
00:16:45,127 --> 00:16:49,120
His mother, father,
and all his relations has let him alone.

172
00:16:50,167 --> 00:16:51,885
<i>So, he needs someone who don't.</i>

173
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,918
(They laugh)

174
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:56,759
(Dog barks frantically)

175
00:17:13,287 --> 00:17:15,278
Supper!

176
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:17,283
Oliver, ain't you done yet?

177
00:17:18,327 --> 00:17:20,204
<i>I've never known such an idle boy.</i>

178
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,238
<i>Get down them stairs.</i>

179
00:17:22,287 --> 00:17:23,959
<i>Mr Sowerberry!</i>

180
00:17:24,007 --> 00:17:25,599
Supper.

181
00:17:25,647 --> 00:17:28,161
<i>I've had a thought, my dear.</i>

182
00:17:28,207 --> 00:17:31,916
"Had a thought." You want to be careful,
Mr Sowerberry. You'll get brain fever.

183
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,559
It's about young Twist.

184
00:17:33,607 --> 00:17:35,199
<i>What about him?</i>

185
00:17:35,247 --> 00:17:37,283
A very good-looking boy.

186
00:17:37,327 --> 00:17:39,124
He will be. He eats enough.

187
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:43,445
There's an expression of melancholy
in his face, my dear.

188
00:17:43,487 --> 00:17:47,275
He would make a delightful mute, my love.

189
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:53,197
l-I don't mean a regular mute
to attend grown-up funerals, my dear.

190
00:17:53,247 --> 00:17:56,284
But only for children's practice.

191
00:17:57,287 --> 00:17:58,879
(Church bells ring)

192
00:18:10,287 --> 00:18:12,118
Look at him.

193
00:18:13,167 --> 00:18:14,600
<i>Look at him.</i>

194
00:18:15,647 --> 00:18:17,239
A workhouse boy and a sneak.

195
00:18:17,287 --> 00:18:18,879
Look at him.

196
00:18:18,927 --> 00:18:21,725
Mark my words, I'll see him hung.

197
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,359
<i>Can't be too soon.</i>

198
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:30,082
Workhouse...how's your mother?

199
00:18:30,127 --> 00:18:31,719
OLIVER: She's dead.

200
00:18:31,767 --> 00:18:33,359
Oh.

201
00:18:33,407 --> 00:18:35,125
What did she die of, Workhouse?

202
00:18:37,087 --> 00:18:40,079
Oh, are you gonna cry, Workhouse?

203
00:18:40,127 --> 00:18:41,924
What set you off?

204
00:18:41,967 --> 00:18:43,559
<i>Not you.</i>

205
00:18:46,487 --> 00:18:47,886
Not me, eh?

206
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:49,519
No, not you.

207
00:18:49,567 --> 00:18:52,604
And you'd better not
say anything about my mother.

208
00:18:54,047 --> 00:18:55,639
"Better not"?

209
00:18:56,687 --> 00:18:58,086
About your mother?

210
00:18:59,087 --> 00:19:01,760
Well, I'm very sorry and I pity you very much,

211
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,880
but you must know, Workhouse,
your mother was a regular right down bad 'un.

212
00:19:08,487 --> 00:19:10,079
What did you say?

213
00:19:10,127 --> 00:19:11,799
A regular right down bad 'un.

214
00:19:11,847 --> 00:19:16,443
It's a good thing she died when she did
or she'd be hard-labouring or transported.

215
00:19:16,487 --> 00:19:19,559
Or hung, which is most likely,
isn't it, Workhouse?

216
00:19:22,367 --> 00:19:24,244
Help, Mrs Charlotte!

217
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,084
He'll murder me! Help!

218
00:19:27,487 --> 00:19:29,079
<i>Help! Get off!</i>

219
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:31,315
For God's sake!

220
00:19:31,367 --> 00:19:32,766
<i>Help me!</i>

221
00:19:32,807 --> 00:19:35,002
CHARLOTTE: Stop it, you beast! You animal!

222
00:19:35,047 --> 00:19:36,924
NOAH: He's murdering me! Get off!

223
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,559
Get off me now!

224
00:19:38,607 --> 00:19:40,199
I've got hold of him.

225
00:19:40,247 --> 00:19:41,839
OLIVER: Let me near him!

226
00:19:41,887 --> 00:19:43,479
You workhouse devil.

227
00:19:43,527 --> 00:19:45,119
I'll learn you.

228
00:19:45,167 --> 00:19:46,759
You brat!

229
00:19:46,807 --> 00:19:48,399
Get the door, Charlotte!

230
00:19:48,447 --> 00:19:49,846
In with him.

231
00:19:58,487 --> 00:20:00,079
Very violent indeed, sir.

232
00:20:01,887 --> 00:20:03,479
And the missus said,

233
00:20:03,527 --> 00:20:07,839
"If Mr Bumble can spare the time,
then Mr Bumble's to flog him."

234
00:20:08,887 --> 00:20:10,718
Cos the master's out.

235
00:20:15,087 --> 00:20:17,203
<i>In there.</i>

236
00:20:17,247 --> 00:20:19,522
- Oliver!
<i>- Let me out of here!</i>

237
00:20:19,567 --> 00:20:21,558
Do you know this here voice, Oliver?

238
00:20:21,607 --> 00:20:23,006
<i>Yes!</i>

239
00:20:23,047 --> 00:20:24,639
Aren't you afraid of it, sir?

240
00:20:24,687 --> 00:20:27,076
Ain't you trembling while I speak, sir?

241
00:20:27,127 --> 00:20:29,277
<i>No!</i>

242
00:20:32,487 --> 00:20:34,239
He must be mad.

243
00:20:34,287 --> 00:20:36,403
- It's not madness, ma'am. It's meat.
<i>- Meat?</i>

244
00:20:36,447 --> 00:20:38,836
Meat, ma'am, meat. You've overfed him.

245
00:20:38,887 --> 00:20:41,765
If you'd kept this boy on gruel,
this would never have happened.

246
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:45,117
Dear, dear. This comes of being liberal.

247
00:20:46,687 --> 00:20:48,086
What's all this?

248
00:20:48,127 --> 00:20:50,641
Oliver Twist has turned violent, Mr Sowerberry.

249
00:20:50,687 --> 00:20:52,564
Look what he's done to my eye, sir.

250
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:54,199
(Banging)

251
00:20:57,127 --> 00:20:59,436
Now, then. Now, then.

252
00:20:59,487 --> 00:21:01,955
You're a nice young fellow, ain't you?

253
00:21:02,007 --> 00:21:04,362
He called my mother names.

254
00:21:04,407 --> 00:21:07,205
And what if he did? You little ungrateful wretch.

255
00:21:07,247 --> 00:21:09,238
She deserved what he said and worse.

256
00:21:09,287 --> 00:21:11,243
She didn't! It's a lie!

257
00:21:11,287 --> 00:21:12,879
(Gasps)

258
00:21:15,487 --> 00:21:17,478
Do something, Mr Sowerberry.

259
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:19,518
<i>(Breathlessly) He called me a liar!</i>

260
00:21:21,727 --> 00:21:23,001
Do something!

261
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:02,279
(Dog barks)

262
00:23:52,607 --> 00:23:54,199
(Driver urges horses on)

263
00:24:30,487 --> 00:24:32,079
(Dog yelps)

264
00:24:36,887 --> 00:24:37,603
I...

265
00:24:39,127 --> 00:24:40,321
Er...

266
00:24:40,367 --> 00:24:41,959
I beg your pardon, miss.

267
00:24:42,967 --> 00:24:44,605
But would you be so kind...

268
00:24:46,047 --> 00:24:47,639
Get off my land.

269
00:24:47,687 --> 00:24:50,679
I don't want no beggars here! Go on!

270
00:24:50,727 --> 00:24:52,319
Get off!

271
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:53,959
Or I'll put the dog on you!

272
00:25:32,287 --> 00:25:35,962
I haven't much,
but you're more than welcome to it.

273
00:25:37,887 --> 00:25:39,479
Be careful. It's hot.

274
00:25:50,487 --> 00:25:53,559
<i>Seeing you gave me such a turn.</i>

275
00:25:53,607 --> 00:25:56,041
My eyes ain't what they were.

276
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:57,281
But...

277
00:25:58,287 --> 00:26:00,357
I just thought for a moment...

278
00:26:08,687 --> 00:26:10,837
Why are you on the road at all?

279
00:26:10,887 --> 00:26:13,003
A little mite like you?

280
00:26:14,047 --> 00:26:16,720
<i>- Where are you headed?</i>
- London, ma'am.

281
00:26:16,767 --> 00:26:18,359
London.

282
00:26:19,407 --> 00:26:20,999
London.

283
00:26:21,047 --> 00:26:22,639
Oh!

284
00:26:22,687 --> 00:26:24,803
Dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

285
00:27:46,647 --> 00:27:48,239
Hello, my man.

286
00:27:49,487 --> 00:27:51,079
What's your game?

287
00:27:53,527 --> 00:27:55,119
You're not from these parts?

288
00:27:56,847 --> 00:27:58,439
Where are you from, then?

289
00:28:00,927 --> 00:28:02,519
I've been walking...

290
00:28:02,567 --> 00:28:03,841
seven days.

291
00:28:03,887 --> 00:28:05,479
Seven days?

292
00:28:05,527 --> 00:28:08,325
Cor. I expect you want grub.

293
00:28:09,367 --> 00:28:11,005
And you shall have it.

294
00:28:11,047 --> 00:28:13,607
I'm at a low-water mark, myself,
just at the moment,

295
00:28:13,647 --> 00:28:15,239
but I'll fork out and stump.

296
00:28:16,287 --> 00:28:18,164
Come on, up with you. On your pins.

297
00:28:30,687 --> 00:28:32,279
Oh, by the by,

298
00:28:32,327 --> 00:28:33,919
my name is Jack Dawkins,

299
00:28:33,967 --> 00:28:35,878
better known as the Artful Dodger.

300
00:28:35,927 --> 00:28:37,519
Oliver Twist.

301
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:41,083
Why are you known as the Artful Dodger?

302
00:28:42,407 --> 00:28:43,999
That's why.

303
00:28:51,887 --> 00:28:53,479
Got any lodgings?

304
00:28:53,527 --> 00:28:55,119
Money?

305
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:59,443
I suppose you want some place to sleep tonight,
don't you?

306
00:29:38,087 --> 00:29:39,679
MAN: <i>Rag and bone!</i>

307
00:29:40,727 --> 00:29:43,605
I expect you walking for so long
was a beak's order.

308
00:29:43,647 --> 00:29:45,239
What's that mean?

309
00:29:45,287 --> 00:29:47,005
Don't you know what a "beak" is?

310
00:29:48,047 --> 00:29:49,639
A bird's mouth, isn't it?

311
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:51,279
Cor, you are green.

312
00:29:51,327 --> 00:29:55,036
A beak's a magistrate, my son.
Where you been all your life?

313
00:30:01,287 --> 00:30:04,438
WOMAN: <i>Come back here. I want to talk to you.</i>

314
00:30:14,487 --> 00:30:16,079
(Baby cries)

315
00:30:43,847 --> 00:30:45,439
(Dodger whistles)

316
00:30:45,487 --> 00:30:47,796
BOY: <i>Now, then?</i>
DODGER: Plummy and slam.

317
00:30:49,407 --> 00:30:52,001
There's two of you. Who's he?

318
00:30:52,047 --> 00:30:53,958
DODGER: <i>A new pal.</i>
- Where'd he come from?

319
00:30:54,007 --> 00:30:55,804
Greenland. Is the old 'un there?

320
00:30:55,847 --> 00:30:57,519
<i>Upstairs, sorting the wipes.</i>

321
00:31:11,807 --> 00:31:13,399
(Whispers)

322
00:31:14,887 --> 00:31:16,479
This is him, Fagin.

323
00:31:16,527 --> 00:31:18,597
My new friend, Oliver Twist.

324
00:31:18,647 --> 00:31:20,239
Well, well...

325
00:31:20,287 --> 00:31:22,437
Oliver Twist.

326
00:31:22,487 --> 00:31:24,443
(Boys titter)

327
00:31:24,487 --> 00:31:27,684
I hope I have the honour
of a more intimate acquaintance.

328
00:31:28,727 --> 00:31:30,638
We're very glad to see you, Oliver.

329
00:31:30,687 --> 00:31:33,724
Very. Dodger, take off the sausages.

330
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:35,837
And let's make a space at the table...

331
00:31:35,887 --> 00:31:37,479
for Oliver.

332
00:31:38,527 --> 00:31:42,486
You are staring at the pocket handkerchiefs,
hey, my dear?

333
00:31:42,527 --> 00:31:46,440
There's a good many of them, ain't there?
We just looked 'em out ready for the wash.

334
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:48,443
<i>That's all, my dear.</i>

335
00:31:49,487 --> 00:31:51,079
Blow it.

336
00:31:52,127 --> 00:31:53,446
Hot.

337
00:31:56,087 --> 00:31:57,679
<i>Now, then, Oliver.</i>

338
00:31:57,727 --> 00:32:00,639
What you must have is a hot gin and water.

339
00:32:00,687 --> 00:32:02,405
Warms the cockles.

340
00:32:02,447 --> 00:32:06,440
Only drink it quick, cos another
of these gentlemen wants the tumbler.

341
00:32:12,047 --> 00:32:13,719
- (Hiccups)
- (Boys laugh)

342
00:32:27,127 --> 00:32:28,719
He's such a nice lad.

343
00:32:29,727 --> 00:32:32,195
<i>I have a feeling he'll turn out a hard worker.</i>

344
00:32:32,247 --> 00:32:34,044
<i>Yeah, a hard worker.</i>

345
00:32:59,527 --> 00:33:01,119
Oliver.

346
00:33:04,007 --> 00:33:05,599
Oliver?

347
00:33:59,487 --> 00:34:01,796
(Fagin gasps)

348
00:34:16,887 --> 00:34:18,479
Clever dogs.

349
00:34:24,087 --> 00:34:25,679
Clever dogs.

350
00:34:28,487 --> 00:34:29,681
Ah.

351
00:34:30,687 --> 00:34:32,279
Fine fellows.

352
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:37,599
Ah, fine fellows.

353
00:34:41,087 --> 00:34:43,681
(Lilting) Fine fellows.

354
00:34:44,687 --> 00:34:46,996
Fine fellows.

355
00:34:48,047 --> 00:34:50,641
<i>Fine fellows.</i>

356
00:34:52,407 --> 00:34:54,602
Fine fellows.

357
00:35:00,127 --> 00:35:04,040
What do you watch me for? Why are you
awake? What have you seen? Speak out, boy!

358
00:35:04,087 --> 00:35:05,884
Quick! Quick! Or it's your life.

359
00:35:05,927 --> 00:35:08,395
I wasn't able to sleep any longer, sir.

360
00:35:08,447 --> 00:35:10,005
I'm very sorry if I disturbed you.

361
00:35:10,047 --> 00:35:12,038
- You were not awake a moment ago?
- No, sir.

362
00:35:12,087 --> 00:35:13,679
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

363
00:35:16,727 --> 00:35:19,241
Of course you were asleep, my dear.
I know that.

364
00:35:20,487 --> 00:35:22,159
I only tried to frighten you.

365
00:35:22,207 --> 00:35:24,277
You're a brave boy, Oliver.

366
00:35:27,047 --> 00:35:29,641
Did you see any of those pretty things, my dear?

367
00:35:29,687 --> 00:35:31,279
- Yes, sir.
- Ah!

368
00:35:31,327 --> 00:35:32,919
They...

369
00:35:32,967 --> 00:35:34,559
They're mine, Oliver.

370
00:35:34,607 --> 00:35:36,199
My little property.

371
00:35:36,247 --> 00:35:37,839
For my old age.

372
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:40,280
It's our secret.

373
00:35:41,207 --> 00:35:42,560
You understand, my dear?

374
00:35:42,607 --> 00:35:44,199
Yes, sir.

375
00:35:45,247 --> 00:35:46,965
Can I get up now, sir?

376
00:36:20,647 --> 00:36:22,319
MAN OUTSIDE: <i>Blimey!</i>

377
00:36:30,687 --> 00:36:33,076
I hope you've been at work this morning,
my dears.

378
00:36:33,127 --> 00:36:34,526
<i>- Hard.</i>
<i>- As nails.</i>

379
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,159
Good boys!

380
00:36:36,207 --> 00:36:37,606
Good boys.

381
00:36:37,647 --> 00:36:39,046
What you got, Dodger?

382
00:36:39,087 --> 00:36:40,805
<i>- Couple of pocket books.</i>
- Lined?

383
00:36:40,847 --> 00:36:42,439
Pretty well.

384
00:36:52,367 --> 00:36:53,959
Oh.

385
00:36:55,007 --> 00:36:56,599
Dodge...

386
00:36:57,727 --> 00:36:59,319
<i>I don't know, Dodge.</i>

387
00:37:00,407 --> 00:37:01,999
Ah.

388
00:37:03,047 --> 00:37:04,639
Well.

389
00:37:04,687 --> 00:37:06,837
Not as heavy as they might be.

390
00:37:06,887 --> 00:37:08,479
But very neat.

391
00:37:08,527 --> 00:37:10,119
And nicely made.

392
00:37:12,047 --> 00:37:15,244
<i>- Ingenious workman, ain't he, Oliver?</i>
- Indeed, sir.

393
00:37:15,287 --> 00:37:18,438
And, Charley, what have you got, my dear?

394
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:20,603
- Wipes.
- Wipes?

395
00:37:25,127 --> 00:37:27,197
They're very good ones.

396
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:28,839
Oh, very...

397
00:37:33,487 --> 00:37:35,239
You haven't marked them well.

398
00:37:36,367 --> 00:37:38,835
The marks should be picked out with a needle.

399
00:37:38,887 --> 00:37:41,321
And we'll teach Oliver how to do it.

400
00:37:41,367 --> 00:37:43,927
<i>- Shall us, Oliver?</i>
- If you please, sir.

401
00:37:43,967 --> 00:37:47,596
You'd like to make pocket handkerchiefs
as easy as Charley Bates, wouldn't you?

402
00:37:47,647 --> 00:37:50,241
Very much indeed, if you'll teach me, sir.

403
00:37:50,287 --> 00:37:52,403
I never met anyone so green.

404
00:38:03,487 --> 00:38:05,079
(Mutters)

405
00:38:09,487 --> 00:38:11,079
Now, then, boys.

406
00:38:11,127 --> 00:38:12,719
The game.

407
00:38:14,767 --> 00:38:19,045
We'll show Oliver
how to make pocket handkerchiefs.

408
00:38:20,687 --> 00:38:23,360
You'd like to play a game, wouldn't you, Oliver?

409
00:38:23,407 --> 00:38:24,999
Yes, sir.

410
00:38:51,127 --> 00:38:53,118
(Fakes a groan)

411
00:39:46,527 --> 00:39:48,563
BOY: <i>Got the time, guv?</i>

412
00:39:48,607 --> 00:39:50,006
It's er...

413
00:39:50,047 --> 00:39:51,639
eight o'clock.

414
00:40:00,887 --> 00:40:03,196
Playing the game, were we, Fagin?

415
00:40:03,247 --> 00:40:05,044
As is our custom, my dear.

416
00:40:05,087 --> 00:40:07,078
He's new. Who's he?

417
00:40:07,127 --> 00:40:08,719
<i>Oh, this is Oliver.</i>

418
00:40:08,767 --> 00:40:10,359
<i>Oliver,</i>

419
00:40:10,407 --> 00:40:14,082
these are our very good friends, Bet and Nancy.

420
00:40:17,247 --> 00:40:19,602
See, Dodger, you want to learn from him.

421
00:40:19,647 --> 00:40:21,239
He's got manners, he has.

422
00:40:21,287 --> 00:40:22,720
Proper gentleman.

423
00:40:22,767 --> 00:40:26,077
Fagin, we popped in
because we're that cold inside.

424
00:40:26,127 --> 00:40:28,595
As is your custom, my dear.

425
00:40:28,647 --> 00:40:29,443
Charley.

426
00:40:29,487 --> 00:40:31,079
Come on, Oliver, join us.

427
00:40:31,127 --> 00:40:33,960
Or don't you sit with the common folk?

428
00:40:35,007 --> 00:40:39,000
Now, you want to be careful of this lot, Oliver.
He'll have you picking...

429
00:40:39,047 --> 00:40:44,041
Picking out the marks. That's what we
was teaching him, ain't it, Oliver, my dear?

430
00:40:44,087 --> 00:40:45,679
- Yes, sir.
<i>- "Yes, sir"?</i>

431
00:40:45,727 --> 00:40:48,480
You know who you're talking to, do you?

432
00:40:48,527 --> 00:40:51,200
What's your mother got to say
about you being here, Oliver?

433
00:40:51,247 --> 00:40:53,841
I haven't got a mother. I'm an orphan.

434
00:40:53,887 --> 00:40:55,479
You're in the right company, then.

435
00:40:58,487 --> 00:41:00,876
Come on, Oliver, I'll teach you how to play.

436
00:41:00,927 --> 00:41:02,804
It's called Spec or Speculation.

437
00:41:02,847 --> 00:41:04,439
Three cards each.

438
00:41:04,487 --> 00:41:06,205
And then, the one he turns up...

439
00:41:06,247 --> 00:41:07,839
is trumps.

440
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:18,916
This is a pleasant life, ain't it, my dear?

441
00:41:23,887 --> 00:41:25,479
When can I go out, sir?

442
00:41:25,527 --> 00:41:28,041
FAGIN: <i>Soon. Soon.</i>

443
00:41:28,087 --> 00:41:29,679
Let's...

444
00:41:30,727 --> 00:41:32,445
Let's see what you've learned.

445
00:41:33,487 --> 00:41:35,079
Would you like that?

446
00:41:35,127 --> 00:41:36,719
Oh, yes, sir.

447
00:41:37,767 --> 00:41:39,439
See if you can take this out...

448
00:41:40,887 --> 00:41:42,479
..without my feeling it.

449
00:42:08,687 --> 00:42:10,279
Is it gone?

450
00:42:12,527 --> 00:42:14,722
You're a clever boy, my dear.

451
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:17,803
I never saw a sharper lad.

452
00:42:24,287 --> 00:42:25,959
Here's a shilling for you.

453
00:42:27,007 --> 00:42:29,885
Make the Dodger and Charley your models.

454
00:42:29,927 --> 00:42:33,397
Especially the Dodger, my dear.
He'll be a great man himself.

455
00:42:33,447 --> 00:42:35,039
Make you one, too.

456
00:42:35,087 --> 00:42:39,046
If you go on this way,
you'll be the greatest man of the time.

457
00:42:40,447 --> 00:42:41,926
Oh...

458
00:42:41,967 --> 00:42:43,798
Thank you very much, sir.

459
00:42:47,927 --> 00:42:49,519
(Traders shout)

460
00:43:55,887 --> 00:43:58,082
Thief! Your handkerchief, sir.

461
00:43:58,127 --> 00:43:59,526
Stop, thieves!

462
00:44:04,927 --> 00:44:06,440
Thief!

463
00:44:10,487 --> 00:44:12,079
Him!

464
00:44:12,127 --> 00:44:13,719
Thief!

465
00:44:17,767 --> 00:44:19,359
Thief!

466
00:44:30,767 --> 00:44:32,359
<i>Stop, thief!</i>

467
00:44:53,727 --> 00:44:55,604
(Babble of distorted voices)

468
00:44:57,127 --> 00:44:58,276
Where's the gentleman?

469
00:44:58,327 --> 00:44:59,646
I hope they hang him.

470
00:45:01,767 --> 00:45:03,803
- He's scared to death.
- He's putting it on.

471
00:45:03,847 --> 00:45:06,281
- Where's the gentleman?
- Here's the gentleman now.

472
00:45:06,327 --> 00:45:08,204
<i>Is this the boy, sir?</i>

473
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:10,920
- Yes, I'm afraid it is.
- "Afraid it is"? That's a good 'un.

474
00:45:10,967 --> 00:45:12,480
Did you hear him? "Afraid it is"?

475
00:45:12,527 --> 00:45:14,643
- He's hurt himself.
- I did that, sir.

476
00:45:14,687 --> 00:45:16,917
Hurt my knuckle agin his mouth.

477
00:45:16,967 --> 00:45:18,958
But I stopped him.

478
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:22,124
- Get up!
- It wasn't me, sir. It wasn't me.

479
00:45:22,167 --> 00:45:24,522
Course it wasn't. It never is.

480
00:45:24,567 --> 00:45:26,285
- Now, get up.
- Don't hurt him.

481
00:45:26,327 --> 00:45:28,522
Oh, no, sir, I won't hurt him.

482
00:45:33,847 --> 00:45:35,075
This way, gentlemen.

483
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,719
What's next?

484
00:45:37,767 --> 00:45:39,564
That is my name and address, sir.

485
00:45:39,607 --> 00:45:41,165
Officer, who is this fellow?

486
00:45:41,207 --> 00:45:44,517
- My name, sir, is Brownlow.
<i>- Hold your tongue!</i>

487
00:45:44,567 --> 00:45:47,161
Officer, what's this fellow charged with?

488
00:45:47,207 --> 00:45:49,596
Oh, no, no. He's not charged, Your Worship.

489
00:45:49,647 --> 00:45:51,956
- He appears against the boy.
<i>- Swear him.</i>

490
00:45:52,007 --> 00:45:54,396
Before I am sworn, I must beg to say one word.

491
00:45:54,447 --> 00:45:56,881
<i>- Hold your tongue, sir!</i>
- I will not, sir!

492
00:45:56,927 --> 00:45:58,645
Hold your tongue this instant!

493
00:45:58,687 --> 00:46:00,996
You're an insolent, impertinent fellow.

494
00:46:01,047 --> 00:46:03,436
- How dare you bully a magistrate?
- What?

495
00:46:03,487 --> 00:46:06,081
Swear this person. I'll not hear another word.

496
00:46:06,127 --> 00:46:10,325
I do solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole
truth and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

497
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:12,358
Now, what's the charge against the boy?

498
00:46:12,407 --> 00:46:15,001
- I was standing at a book store...
- Hold your tongue!

499
00:46:15,047 --> 00:46:17,880
Where's the policeman? What is this?
Are there any witnesses?

500
00:46:17,927 --> 00:46:19,519
None, Your Worship.

501
00:46:19,567 --> 00:46:21,444
The boy is ill.

502
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,079
Oh, yes, I daresay.

503
00:46:23,127 --> 00:46:26,119
Come along, you vagabond!
None of your tricks here.

504
00:46:26,167 --> 00:46:27,998
<i>- What's your name?</i>
- Water.

505
00:46:28,047 --> 00:46:30,436
What's your name, you hardened scoundrel?

506
00:46:30,487 --> 00:46:32,955
Officer, what's his name?

507
00:46:33,007 --> 00:46:34,235
What's your name, boy?

508
00:46:34,287 --> 00:46:37,085
Some water. Some water.

509
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,721
He says his name is Sam Waters, Your Worship.

510
00:46:39,767 --> 00:46:42,725
<i>- Where does he live?</i>
- Where do you live? Anywhere he can.

511
00:46:42,767 --> 00:46:46,362
Stuff and nonsense.
Don't try to make a fool out of me.

512
00:46:46,407 --> 00:46:48,796
No, no, I think he really is ill, Your Worship.

513
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:50,485
<i>I know better or my name's not Fang.</i>

514
00:46:51,327 --> 00:46:53,636
Stand away, Officer. He's shamming.

515
00:46:53,687 --> 00:46:58,158
He stands committed for three months.
Hard labour, of course. Clear the office.

516
00:46:58,207 --> 00:47:01,244
Stop. Stop. Stop. Don't take him away.

517
00:47:01,287 --> 00:47:03,847
What is this? Who is this? Turn this man out.

518
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:05,479
I will not be turned out!

519
00:47:05,527 --> 00:47:07,119
I will speak!

520
00:47:07,167 --> 00:47:09,920
I saw it all. I own the bookshop.

521
00:47:09,967 --> 00:47:12,720
<i>- I demand to be heard.</i>
- Well, what have you got to say?

522
00:47:12,767 --> 00:47:15,679
- It was not this boy.
<i>- Not this boy? Who was it, then?</i>

523
00:47:15,727 --> 00:47:19,242
The robbery was committed by two other boys
while the gentleman was reading.

524
00:47:19,287 --> 00:47:22,120
I saw it done.
I saw that this boy was perfectly amazed by it.

525
00:47:22,167 --> 00:47:23,566
Why didn't you come before?

526
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:25,438
I hadn't a soul to mind the shop.

527
00:47:25,487 --> 00:47:27,079
Reading, you say.

528
00:47:27,127 --> 00:47:28,879
A book, I suppose.

529
00:47:28,927 --> 00:47:30,963
Yes, the very one he has in his hand.

530
00:47:32,007 --> 00:47:33,679
Dear me, I forgot all about it.

531
00:47:33,727 --> 00:47:35,319
Well, you're a nice one.

532
00:47:35,367 --> 00:47:37,756
To prefer a charge against an innocent boy.

533
00:47:39,207 --> 00:47:40,799
I consider, sir,

534
00:47:40,847 --> 00:47:45,159
that you've obtained that book under very
suspicious and disreputable circumstances.

535
00:47:45,207 --> 00:47:46,401
Damn me!

536
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:48,756
Do you want to press charges
against this fellow?

537
00:47:48,807 --> 00:47:50,320
Certainly not.

538
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:55,236
Well, you may think yourself fortunate
that the owner of the book declines to prosecute.

539
00:47:55,287 --> 00:47:57,357
<i>The boy is discharged. Clear the office.</i>

540
00:47:57,407 --> 00:48:00,319
- Damn me!
- Clear the office! Clear the office!

541
00:48:00,367 --> 00:48:01,959
Next case.

542
00:48:03,007 --> 00:48:04,884
Come on. Move along, sir, please.

543
00:48:04,927 --> 00:48:06,519
Just move along, sir.

544
00:48:06,567 --> 00:48:08,159
There's a good gentleman, sir.

545
00:48:08,207 --> 00:48:10,198
Hold on, Harry. I'll give you a hand.

546
00:48:14,887 --> 00:48:16,798
OFFICER: <i>Make way for the law, sir.</i>

547
00:48:18,487 --> 00:48:20,079
Careful with him.

548
00:48:22,887 --> 00:48:25,082
- Call a coach, pray.
- Right away, sir.

549
00:48:25,127 --> 00:48:26,719
I'm sorry.

550
00:48:26,767 --> 00:48:28,359
Oh. (Chuckles)

551
00:48:28,407 --> 00:48:29,806
Poor boy.

552
00:48:34,647 --> 00:48:36,558
- Mind yourself, madam.
- Thank you, sir.

553
00:48:37,527 --> 00:48:39,438
- Got one, sir.
<i>- Thank you, Officer.</i>

554
00:48:40,487 --> 00:48:42,079
Let me, sir.

555
00:48:46,087 --> 00:48:48,362
- Could you drop me off, sir?
- Of course.

556
00:48:49,687 --> 00:48:50,836
Right...

557
00:48:50,887 --> 00:48:52,878
If you could just take his head, sir.

558
00:48:54,487 --> 00:48:56,717
- Where to, sir?
- Pentonville.

559
00:48:57,727 --> 00:48:59,365
Pentonville.

560
00:49:01,127 --> 00:49:03,925
Answer me, where is he?
What's become of the boy? Speak out

561
00:49:03,967 --> 00:49:07,516
- or I'll throttle you!
- The traps have got him! Let go of me, will ya!

562
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:16,599
Bull's-eye!

563
00:49:16,647 --> 00:49:18,239
Who pitched this here at me?

564
00:49:18,287 --> 00:49:19,766
Who done it?

565
00:49:21,927 --> 00:49:24,521
Bull's-eye. Come here, you sneaking varmint.

566
00:49:24,567 --> 00:49:26,558
What you stopping outside for?

567
00:49:27,927 --> 00:49:29,519
Lay down.

568
00:49:30,527 --> 00:49:32,119
(Whimpers and growls)

569
00:49:32,167 --> 00:49:34,158
<i>What you up to, Fagin?</i>

570
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:35,686
<i>I'll-treating the boys again?</i>

571
00:49:35,727 --> 00:49:38,639
I wonder they don't murder you.
I would if I was them.

572
00:49:38,687 --> 00:49:40,279
Shh!

573
00:49:40,327 --> 00:49:41,919
Don't speak so loud.

574
00:49:41,967 --> 00:49:43,559
You seem out of sorts, Bill.

575
00:49:43,607 --> 00:49:46,121
Give us a drink, and mind you don't poison it.

576
00:49:46,167 --> 00:49:47,759
(Laughs) Charley.

577
00:49:47,807 --> 00:49:49,399
Good stuff, Bill.

578
00:49:51,487 --> 00:49:54,160
So, Dodger, what's it all about?

579
00:49:54,207 --> 00:49:55,799
The new boy.

580
00:49:55,847 --> 00:49:58,236
Come out with us before he was rightly up to it.

581
00:49:58,287 --> 00:49:59,879
<i>Got nabbed by the traps.</i>

582
00:49:59,927 --> 00:50:01,519
You see, Bill,

583
00:50:01,567 --> 00:50:05,480
I'm afraid he may say something
which will get us into trouble.

584
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:08,679
You're blowed upon, Fagin.

585
00:50:09,687 --> 00:50:11,279
And about time.

586
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:14,399
And I'm afraid, you see, Bill,
that if the game were up with us,

587
00:50:14,447 --> 00:50:18,042
it would come out rather worse for you
than it would for me, my dear.

588
00:50:19,047 --> 00:50:20,844
BILL: <i>There's only one thing for it.</i>

589
00:50:20,887 --> 00:50:24,163
Somebody's got to find out at the office
what's being done to him.

590
00:50:24,207 --> 00:50:26,562
Somebody's got to get hold of him somehow.

591
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:29,804
I ain't going near no police office.
Not for nobody, no how.

592
00:50:29,847 --> 00:50:33,886
I have it, the very thing.
Bet will go, won't you, my dear?

593
00:50:33,927 --> 00:50:35,519
I'm blessed if I will.

594
00:50:35,567 --> 00:50:37,956
Nancy, my dear, what do you say?

595
00:50:38,007 --> 00:50:40,567
It won't do. There's no use in trying it on, Fagin.

596
00:50:40,607 --> 00:50:42,677
- What do you mean by that?
<i>- What I say, Bill.</i>

597
00:50:42,727 --> 00:50:46,242
You're just the very person for it.
Nobody knows anything about you.

598
00:50:46,287 --> 00:50:48,482
And as I don't want 'em to neither.

599
00:50:48,527 --> 00:50:50,836
It's rather more no than yes with me, Bill.

600
00:50:50,887 --> 00:50:52,559
She'll go, Fagin.

601
00:50:52,607 --> 00:50:55,679
- No, she won't, Fagin.
<i>- Yes, she will, Fagin.</i>

602
00:50:59,527 --> 00:51:01,119
(Sniffles)

603
00:51:04,847 --> 00:51:06,883
Can I help you, miss?

604
00:51:06,927 --> 00:51:09,395
I'm looking for my little brother.

605
00:51:09,447 --> 00:51:11,119
Now, who would he be?

606
00:51:11,167 --> 00:51:12,759
A lovely little boy.

607
00:51:12,807 --> 00:51:15,799
Lovely manners. Gentle as falling snow.

608
00:51:15,847 --> 00:51:17,439
We don't get many of those.

609
00:51:18,447 --> 00:51:20,756
I think you'll be wanting Mr Fang's court.

610
00:51:27,007 --> 00:51:28,599
George.

611
00:51:28,647 --> 00:51:30,717
This young lady's looking for her brother.

612
00:51:30,767 --> 00:51:33,759
I think he's the one that fainted
and managed to get away with it.

613
00:51:33,807 --> 00:51:36,116
- Gentleman took him away.
- What gentleman?

614
00:51:36,167 --> 00:51:38,158
Gracious heavens, what gentleman?

615
00:51:38,207 --> 00:51:39,606
Well...

616
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:41,319
Lives in Pentonville, I believe.

617
00:51:41,367 --> 00:51:42,959
Oh, my gawd.

618
00:51:43,007 --> 00:51:45,805
No, no, wait, wait, wait...

619
00:51:45,847 --> 00:51:47,439
His card's here somewhere.

620
00:51:56,887 --> 00:51:58,479
Thank you, sir.

621
00:52:56,087 --> 00:52:57,679
Mr Brownlow!

622
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:59,319
Mr Brownlow...

623
00:53:26,647 --> 00:53:30,879
There's something in him
that touched my heart, Mrs Bedwin.

624
00:53:30,927 --> 00:53:32,838
I can't explain it.

625
00:53:33,887 --> 00:53:36,003
I feel the same, sir.

626
00:53:37,127 --> 00:53:38,719
Who is he? What is he?

627
00:53:38,767 --> 00:53:40,359
You know nothing of him.

628
00:53:40,407 --> 00:53:42,967
He had a fever. What of that?

629
00:53:43,007 --> 00:53:45,760
Bad people have fevers sometimes.

630
00:53:45,807 --> 00:53:49,083
I knew a man in Jamaica who was
hanged for murdering his master.

631
00:53:49,127 --> 00:53:50,958
He had a fever six times!

632
00:53:51,007 --> 00:53:53,202
I know there is goodness in him.

633
00:53:53,247 --> 00:53:55,841
<i>- How do you know it?</i>
- Goodness and innocence.

634
00:53:55,887 --> 00:53:59,243
<i>- I knew it the first moment I saw him.</i>
- He'll deceive you.

635
00:53:59,287 --> 00:54:03,405
Let you down at the first opportunity,
like all your other good and innocent causes.

636
00:54:03,447 --> 00:54:06,519
If that boy is good and innocent,
I'll eat my own head, sir.

637
00:54:16,287 --> 00:54:17,879
How do you feel, my dear?

638
00:54:18,927 --> 00:54:20,519
Very happy, sir.

639
00:54:20,567 --> 00:54:22,683
And very grateful to you indeed, sir.

640
00:54:22,727 --> 00:54:24,319
Good boy.

641
00:54:24,367 --> 00:54:27,040
Have we given him any nourishment, Bedwin?

642
00:54:27,087 --> 00:54:28,679
<i>Any slops?</i>

643
00:54:28,727 --> 00:54:30,319
Not slops, sir.

644
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:32,085
Broth.

645
00:54:32,127 --> 00:54:36,245
A couple of glasses of port wine
would have done him a great deal more good.

646
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:37,925
Wouldn't they, Sam?

647
00:54:38,967 --> 00:54:40,480
My name is Oliver, sir.

648
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:42,119
"Oliver"?

649
00:54:43,167 --> 00:54:44,759
Oliver what? Oliver Waters?

650
00:54:44,807 --> 00:54:47,082
No, sir. Twist. Oliver Twist.

651
00:54:48,087 --> 00:54:50,885
Why did you tell the magistrate
your name was Waters?

652
00:54:50,927 --> 00:54:52,565
I never told him so, sir.

653
00:54:52,607 --> 00:54:54,199
You did not?

654
00:54:54,247 --> 00:54:55,839
<i>No, sir.</i>

655
00:54:59,367 --> 00:55:01,517
- You're not angry with me, are you, sir?
<i>- No.</i>

656
00:55:02,567 --> 00:55:04,159
Queer name.

657
00:55:04,207 --> 00:55:05,481
Oliver Twist.

658
00:55:06,927 --> 00:55:09,999
There are a great many books,
are there not, my boy?

659
00:55:10,047 --> 00:55:11,685
<i>A great number, sir.</i>

660
00:55:12,727 --> 00:55:14,319
I never saw so many.

661
00:55:17,287 --> 00:55:21,280
How would you like to grow up a clever man
and <i>write</i> books, hmm?

662
00:55:21,327 --> 00:55:23,204
I think I'd rather read them, sir.

663
00:55:23,247 --> 00:55:24,646
Oh.

664
00:55:24,687 --> 00:55:26,757
Wouldn't you like to be a book writer?

665
00:55:27,807 --> 00:55:30,799
I think it'd be a better thing
to be a book seller, sir.

666
00:55:33,287 --> 00:55:36,006
You have said a very good thing.

667
00:55:37,047 --> 00:55:39,925
Well, well. We won't make an author of you

668
00:55:39,967 --> 00:55:43,960
while there's an honest trade to be learned
or brick-making to turn to.

669
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,123
Are you going to send me away, sir?

670
00:55:46,167 --> 00:55:47,759
No, my dear child.

671
00:55:47,807 --> 00:55:50,480
You need not be afraid
that I'm going to desert you.

672
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:52,119
Unless you give me cause.

673
00:55:52,167 --> 00:55:54,362
- I never, never will, sir.
- I hope not.

674
00:55:54,407 --> 00:55:57,001
Because I feel strongly disposed to trust you.

675
00:55:57,047 --> 00:55:58,958
Thank you, sir.

676
00:56:07,767 --> 00:56:10,235
I'm pleased I won't have to wear those again.

677
00:56:10,287 --> 00:56:12,005
MRS BEDWIN: So are we all, my dear.

678
00:56:13,887 --> 00:56:15,479
There.

679
00:56:37,367 --> 00:56:38,959
(Man whistles)

680
00:57:10,287 --> 00:57:11,879
MAN: <i>Hello.</i>

681
00:57:11,927 --> 00:57:13,519
<i>What's that?</i>

682
00:57:13,567 --> 00:57:15,842
MR BROWNLOW: <i>This is young Oliver Twist.</i>

683
00:57:15,887 --> 00:57:21,405
- Sir, the book seller's boy brought a package.
- Stop him. There's some books to go back.

684
00:57:21,447 --> 00:57:23,039
Is that the boy who had the fever?

685
00:57:23,087 --> 00:57:24,566
<i>That's the boy.</i>

686
00:57:50,487 --> 00:57:52,603
No sign of him, sir.

687
00:57:52,647 --> 00:57:54,524
Oh, dear. I'm very sorry for that.

688
00:57:54,567 --> 00:57:57,240
I particularly wished some books
to be returned tonight.

689
00:57:57,287 --> 00:58:00,279
Send Oliver with them.
He'll be sure to deliver them safely.

690
00:58:00,327 --> 00:58:04,161
Yes, do let me take them.
If you please, sir. I'll run all the way.

691
00:58:13,087 --> 00:58:15,043
You shall go, my dear.

692
00:58:15,087 --> 00:58:17,157
<i>Ask Mrs Bedwin to show you the way.</i>

693
00:58:17,207 --> 00:58:18,799
<i>And Oliver?</i>

694
00:58:19,807 --> 00:58:21,286
Yes, sir.

695
00:58:21,327 --> 00:58:22,919
Give the book seller this.

696
00:58:26,407 --> 00:58:27,999
The money I owe him.

697
00:58:35,087 --> 00:58:36,964
I won't be long, sir.

698
00:58:38,287 --> 00:58:40,562
How long do you think it'll take him?

699
00:58:40,607 --> 00:58:43,121
You really expect him to come back, do you?

700
00:58:43,167 --> 00:58:44,759
You don't?

701
00:58:44,807 --> 00:58:48,402
<i>With a five-pound note in his pocket?</i>
<i>No, I do not.</i>

702
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:52,725
<i>If ever that boy returns to this house,</i>
<i>I'll eat my own head, sir.</i>

703
00:58:54,727 --> 00:58:56,206
And yours.

704
00:59:12,487 --> 00:59:14,364
Oh, my little brother!

705
00:59:14,407 --> 00:59:15,999
OLIVER: <i>No, no!</i>

706
00:59:16,047 --> 00:59:17,480
<i>Help!</i>

707
00:59:17,527 --> 00:59:19,119
It's a miracle.

708
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:20,759
I found him. I found him.

709
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:22,798
Oh, Oliver, Oliver.

710
00:59:22,847 --> 00:59:24,246
Nancy?

711
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:27,996
You're such a naughty boy to make me
suffer such distress on your account.

712
00:59:28,047 --> 00:59:29,844
What's the matter, ma'am?

713
00:59:29,887 --> 00:59:31,479
He ran away from his parents,

714
00:59:31,527 --> 00:59:33,597
hard-working, respectable people,

715
00:59:33,647 --> 00:59:36,241
and joined a set of thieves and bad characters.

716
00:59:36,287 --> 00:59:37,879
Broke his mother's heart.

717
00:59:37,927 --> 00:59:39,201
<i>Young wretch.</i>

718
00:59:39,247 --> 00:59:40,839
Go home, you little brute.

719
00:59:40,887 --> 00:59:44,084
I haven't got any parents. I'm an orphan.
I live in Pentonville.

720
00:59:44,127 --> 00:59:46,516
Only hear him how he braves it out.

721
00:59:46,567 --> 00:59:48,842
- What? Young Oliver!
OLIVER: <i>It's true!</i>

722
00:59:50,807 --> 00:59:52,684
You come home to your poor mother!

723
00:59:52,727 --> 00:59:55,719
I don't belong to them! I don't know them!
Help! Help!

724
00:59:55,767 --> 00:59:57,166
"Help? Help?"

725
00:59:57,207 --> 00:59:59,801
I'll give you "Help! Help!" you little wretch!

726
00:59:59,847 --> 01:00:01,439
And these books!

727
01:00:01,487 --> 01:00:04,957
Have you been astealing them, have you, eh?

728
01:00:05,007 --> 01:00:06,599
You little villain!

729
01:00:06,647 --> 01:00:10,322
That's right. You give it to him.
Only way to bring him to his senses.

730
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:13,279
I will, missus!
You come with me, you little wretch!

731
01:00:13,327 --> 01:00:14,919
WOMAN: <i>It'll do him good.</i>

732
01:00:14,967 --> 01:00:16,559
OLIVER: Who is this man?

733
01:00:16,607 --> 01:00:18,199
BILL: Mind him, Bull's-eye!

734
01:00:18,247 --> 01:00:19,646
OLIVER: Help! Help!

735
01:00:22,047 --> 01:00:23,878
Look at him, Fagin!

736
01:00:23,927 --> 01:00:25,519
Hold me, somebody.

737
01:00:26,527 --> 01:00:28,722
Hold me, somebody, while I laugh it out.

738
01:00:28,767 --> 01:00:30,758
Look at his togs, Fagin!

739
01:00:30,807 --> 01:00:33,321
Delighted to see you looking so well, my dear.

740
01:00:33,367 --> 01:00:36,359
Why didn't you write, my dear,
and say you was coming?

741
01:00:36,407 --> 01:00:38,682
We'd have got something warm for supper.

742
01:00:40,287 --> 01:00:42,562
Hello, Fagin. What's that? That's mine, Fagin!

743
01:00:42,607 --> 01:00:45,246
No, my dear. Mine, Bill, mine.
You shall have the books.

744
01:00:45,287 --> 01:00:49,166
If that ain't mine and Nancy's, I'll take
the boy back again. Come on. Hand over.

745
01:00:49,207 --> 01:00:51,641
This is hardly fair, Bill, hardly fair. Is it, Nancy?

746
01:00:51,687 --> 01:00:54,485
Fair or not fair, hand over, I tell ya.

747
01:00:54,527 --> 01:00:57,599
Give it here, you avaricious old skeleton!

748
01:00:57,647 --> 01:01:01,959
Give it here! That's for our share of the trouble.
Not half enough neither.

749
01:01:02,007 --> 01:01:05,682
<i>You may keep the books if you're</i>
<i>fond of reading. If you ain't, sell 'em.</i>

750
01:01:05,727 --> 01:01:07,319
They're very pretty.

751
01:01:07,367 --> 01:01:09,483
Beautiful writing, isn't it, Oliver?

752
01:01:09,527 --> 01:01:12,724
Send them back. They belong to Mr Brownlow.

753
01:01:12,767 --> 01:01:14,803
Send them back, the books and the money.

754
01:01:14,847 --> 01:01:16,963
<i>He'll think I stole them.</i>

755
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:20,283
- Please send them back.
- The boy's right. You're right, Oliver.

756
01:01:20,327 --> 01:01:22,204
They will think you've stolen 'em.

757
01:01:23,247 --> 01:01:26,319
It couldn't have happened better
if we'd chosen our time.

758
01:01:26,367 --> 01:01:27,959
Help! Help! Police!

759
01:01:30,447 --> 01:01:32,165
Keep back the dog, Bill.

760
01:01:32,207 --> 01:01:34,516
- He'll tear the boy to pieces.
- Serve him right.

761
01:01:34,567 --> 01:01:36,478
Help! Fetch the police!

762
01:01:36,527 --> 01:01:38,119
<i>Fetch the police!</i>

763
01:01:38,167 --> 01:01:40,840
Step aside or I'll split your head against the wall.

764
01:01:40,887 --> 01:01:45,802
I don't care. That child shan't be torn down
by the dog unless you kill me first.

765
01:01:47,047 --> 01:01:48,605
<i>Bull's-eye! Here!</i>

766
01:01:48,647 --> 01:01:50,365
Bull's-eye!

767
01:01:56,887 --> 01:01:58,479
FAGIN: Dodger!

768
01:01:59,527 --> 01:02:01,119
Get after him!

769
01:02:25,727 --> 01:02:28,195
Hey! (Laughs)

770
01:02:28,247 --> 01:02:29,202
Hey!

771
01:02:37,607 --> 01:02:39,882
So you wants to get away, my dear, did you?

772
01:02:39,927 --> 01:02:42,236
Wanted to call for the police, did you?

773
01:02:42,287 --> 01:02:43,925
We'll soon cure you of that.

774
01:02:46,487 --> 01:02:49,126
I won't stand by and see this done, Fagin!

775
01:02:49,167 --> 01:02:51,761
You've got the boy. What more do you want?

776
01:02:51,807 --> 01:02:54,924
Keep quiet, Nancy,
or I'll quieten you for a good long time to come.

777
01:02:54,967 --> 01:02:56,559
Let him be! Let him be!

778
01:02:56,607 --> 01:02:59,201
You're a fine one for the boy to make a friend of.

779
01:02:59,247 --> 01:03:01,317
NANCY:
<i>God Almighty, help me, I am.</i>

780
01:03:01,367 --> 01:03:05,076
He's a thief, a liar, a devil,
all that's bad from this night forth.

781
01:03:05,127 --> 01:03:07,641
Ain't that enough for the old wretch
without blows?

782
01:03:07,687 --> 01:03:10,155
Come, come, we must have civil words.
Civil words.

783
01:03:10,207 --> 01:03:11,799
Civil words?

784
01:03:11,847 --> 01:03:13,519
Civil words? You old villain!

785
01:03:13,567 --> 01:03:16,639
I thieved for you
when I was a child not half as old as this!

786
01:03:16,687 --> 01:03:18,279
It's your living.

787
01:03:18,327 --> 01:03:21,524
Yes, and you're the wretch that drove me to it.

788
01:03:21,567 --> 01:03:24,559
And who will keep me at it day and night
until I die!

789
01:03:28,087 --> 01:03:29,679
Dodger.

790
01:03:29,727 --> 01:03:31,922
Charley. Put Oliver to bed.

791
01:03:31,967 --> 01:03:35,801
Best to take them clothes off first.
They're too good to sleep in.

792
01:03:35,847 --> 01:03:38,122
<i>This suit cost more than four pence ha'penny.</i>

793
01:03:38,167 --> 01:03:41,125
I never felt such lovely stuff. Have you, Dodger?

794
01:03:41,167 --> 01:03:42,520
Not me.

795
01:03:42,567 --> 01:03:45,843
I'm willing to lay odds this is the same stuff
the queen wears on Sundays.

796
01:03:45,887 --> 01:03:47,878
(Boys laugh)

797
01:03:49,727 --> 01:03:51,319
Quick, get him.

798
01:03:51,367 --> 01:03:52,846
Take it off.

799
01:03:55,447 --> 01:03:57,039
<i>Lift him up.</i>

800
01:03:57,087 --> 01:03:58,679
Up he goes.

801
01:03:58,727 --> 01:04:00,922
(Barking)

802
01:04:02,247 --> 01:04:03,885
<i>Get them shoes off.</i>

803
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:22,839
(Bells ring)

804
01:04:38,087 --> 01:04:40,726
Little something for your luncheon, my dear?

805
01:04:56,887 --> 01:04:58,878
Shall we have a little chat?

806
01:04:58,927 --> 01:05:00,519
<i>Oliver?</i>

807
01:05:01,567 --> 01:05:03,159
<i>Shall us?</i>

808
01:05:05,887 --> 01:05:07,479
I expect you'd welcome...

809
01:05:08,727 --> 01:05:12,197
..the sound of a human voice again,
eh, my dear?

810
01:05:17,687 --> 01:05:19,279
D'you know...

811
01:05:20,327 --> 01:05:23,683
..what I consider
the greatest sin in the world, my dear?

812
01:05:25,287 --> 01:05:26,879
Ingratitude.

813
01:05:29,287 --> 01:05:30,959
That's what you're guilty of.

814
01:05:31,967 --> 01:05:33,559
Ingratitude.

815
01:05:33,607 --> 01:05:35,484
We took you in, we cherished you.

816
01:05:35,527 --> 01:05:37,483
If we hadn't, you might have died of hunger.

817
01:05:37,527 --> 01:05:41,042
And how do you repay us? You run away.
You cry out for the police.

818
01:05:41,087 --> 01:05:43,282
You cause us great anxiety and expense.

819
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:50,164
There was a lad once just like you.

820
01:05:50,207 --> 01:05:52,482
I was a father to him. He ran away like you.

821
01:05:52,527 --> 01:05:55,917
He indeed went to the police
and can you guess how he ended up?

822
01:05:59,287 --> 01:06:00,879
They hanged him.

823
01:06:01,927 --> 01:06:03,519
At the Old Bailey.

824
01:06:05,087 --> 01:06:09,285
Certain evidence was made available,
not all of it precisely true, but...

825
01:06:10,327 --> 01:06:15,879
..all of it necessary to provide for my own safety
and that of my friends.

826
01:06:16,927 --> 01:06:18,519
Yeah. Poor boy.

827
01:06:19,567 --> 01:06:21,159
Hanged.

828
01:06:22,207 --> 01:06:24,482
It's a terrible thing, hanging, Oliver.

829
01:06:24,527 --> 01:06:26,324
Dawn. The gallows.

830
01:06:26,367 --> 01:06:28,358
The rope. The noose.

831
01:06:29,367 --> 01:06:31,881
You don't always have to be guilty,
you see, Oliver.

832
01:06:31,927 --> 01:06:35,806
They hang you for anything these days,
because they're so very fond of hanging.

833
01:06:45,087 --> 01:06:46,679
But if you do as you're told,

834
01:06:47,927 --> 01:06:49,758
we'll be very good friends yet.

835
01:06:59,887 --> 01:07:02,037
You must feel free to walk about now, Oliver.

836
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:06,805
<i>Yes, feel free.</i>

837
01:07:13,487 --> 01:07:14,840
Here, Oliver.

838
01:07:14,887 --> 01:07:16,479
<i>Yes?</i>

839
01:07:16,527 --> 01:07:19,439
I'd like you to assist me
in my toilet straight away.

840
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:22,403
Will you do that for me, my man?

841
01:07:22,447 --> 01:07:24,563
All right. I'll be glad of the company.

842
01:07:24,607 --> 01:07:26,199
There's a good fellow.

843
01:07:26,247 --> 01:07:28,715
You may start by japanning my trotter cases.

844
01:07:28,767 --> 01:07:31,884
In plain English, clean my boots.

845
01:07:35,687 --> 01:07:37,803
What a pity he ain't a prig.

846
01:07:37,847 --> 01:07:39,724
He don't know what's good for him.

847
01:07:39,767 --> 01:07:42,281
'Spose you don't even know what a prig is.

848
01:07:42,327 --> 01:07:43,919
Yes, I do. It's a...

849
01:07:43,967 --> 01:07:45,559
It's a...

850
01:07:45,607 --> 01:07:47,199
thief.

851
01:07:47,247 --> 01:07:48,965
You're one, aren't you?

852
01:07:49,007 --> 01:07:50,599
Yes, I am. And so we all are.

853
01:07:50,647 --> 01:07:53,559
Down to the dog.
And he's the downiest one of the lot.

854
01:07:53,607 --> 01:07:55,404
And the least given to peaching.

855
01:07:55,447 --> 01:07:59,235
He wouldn't so much as bark in a witness box
for fear of committing himself.

856
01:07:59,287 --> 01:08:01,926
He's an out-and-out Christian, he is.

857
01:08:01,967 --> 01:08:04,640
Why don't you put yourself under Fagin, Oliver?

858
01:08:04,687 --> 01:08:06,803
You'll make a fortune out of hand.

859
01:08:06,847 --> 01:08:09,122
Like your old gentleman in Pentonville.

860
01:08:09,167 --> 01:08:10,759
Big house that.

861
01:08:10,807 --> 01:08:12,399
I had a peep at it, I did.

862
01:08:12,447 --> 01:08:14,403
Nice inside, was it?

863
01:08:14,447 --> 01:08:15,846
Yes.

864
01:08:15,887 --> 01:08:18,845
And I slept in a proper bed in my own room.

865
01:08:18,887 --> 01:08:20,479
Good stuff on the walls, eh?

866
01:08:20,527 --> 01:08:22,119
<i>Yes, indeed.</i>

867
01:08:22,167 --> 01:08:23,759
Put yourself under Fagin

868
01:08:23,807 --> 01:08:27,959
and you'll be able to retire to a property
just like that.

869
01:08:28,007 --> 01:08:29,599
And do the genteel.

870
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:31,877
No. He's scared he'll come to be scragged.

871
01:08:31,927 --> 01:08:33,565
I don't know what that means.

872
01:08:37,127 --> 01:08:40,358
<i>If you don't take pocket handkerchiefs</i>
<i>and watches, nolly,</i>

873
01:08:40,407 --> 01:08:43,683
some other cove will. And you have
the same right to them as they have.

874
01:08:43,727 --> 01:08:46,400
To be sure. To be sure.

875
01:08:46,447 --> 01:08:49,280
It all lies in a nutshell, my dear. In a nutshell.

876
01:08:49,327 --> 01:08:53,878
Take the Dodger's word for it.
He understands the catechism of his trade.

877
01:09:04,287 --> 01:09:05,879
Cabbie.

878
01:09:24,967 --> 01:09:26,559
I've come from Bill.

879
01:09:26,607 --> 01:09:28,199
For what?

880
01:09:28,247 --> 01:09:29,839
For no harm.

881
01:09:29,887 --> 01:09:31,479
I don't believe it.

882
01:09:33,087 --> 01:09:36,159
If I could help you, I would,
but I've not the power.

883
01:09:36,207 --> 01:09:39,005
Now, I've promised him
you'll be good and silent.

884
01:09:39,047 --> 01:09:41,515
If you're not, you'll only do yourself harm.

885
01:09:41,567 --> 01:09:43,159
And me, too.

886
01:09:53,287 --> 01:09:54,879
Did he come quiet?

887
01:09:54,927 --> 01:09:56,519
Like a lamb.

888
01:09:59,367 --> 01:10:00,959
Sit down.

889
01:10:06,447 --> 01:10:08,039
Let me read you a lecture.

890
01:10:14,487 --> 01:10:16,318
You know what this is?

891
01:10:16,367 --> 01:10:17,959
Yes.

892
01:10:18,007 --> 01:10:20,237
<i>Well, then.</i>

893
01:10:23,287 --> 01:10:24,879
This is powder.

894
01:10:32,887 --> 01:10:34,445
That here's a bullet.

895
01:10:37,687 --> 01:10:39,803
And this is a little bit of an old hat...

896
01:10:40,847 --> 01:10:42,439
..for wadding.

897
01:10:48,487 --> 01:10:50,284
Now it's loaded.

898
01:10:50,327 --> 01:10:52,318
Yes. I can see it is, sir.

899
01:10:53,687 --> 01:10:57,521
If you speak a word when you're out of doors
with me, unless I speak to you,

900
01:10:58,527 --> 01:11:01,246
this loading will go in your head without notice.

901
01:11:01,287 --> 01:11:05,200
So, if you do make up your mind
to speak without leave,

902
01:11:05,247 --> 01:11:07,203
says your prayers first.

903
01:11:07,247 --> 01:11:09,715
NANCY:
<i>The short and long of what you mean is,</i>

904
01:11:09,767 --> 01:11:14,318
if you're crossed by him, you'll prevent him ever
telling tales by shooting him through the head.

905
01:11:15,367 --> 01:11:17,881
And you'll take your chances swinging for it.

906
01:11:17,927 --> 01:11:21,442
That's it. Women always put things
in the fewest words.

907
01:11:21,487 --> 01:11:23,682
Supper, Nancy.

908
01:11:23,727 --> 01:11:25,922
And then a snooze afore starting.

909
01:11:52,567 --> 01:11:53,920
MAN: <i>Aha!</i>

910
01:11:53,967 --> 01:11:55,559
My pal Bill!

911
01:11:55,607 --> 01:11:57,518
The door's open! Come in!

912
01:12:00,487 --> 01:12:02,284
(Whispers) Don't make such a row!

913
01:12:06,087 --> 01:12:07,964
Show us a glim, Toby.

914
01:12:08,007 --> 01:12:10,123
Barney, a glim. Show the gentleman in.

915
01:12:11,367 --> 01:12:14,518
Barney! Wake up first, if convenient!

916
01:12:26,567 --> 01:12:28,159
Mr Sykes.

917
01:12:28,207 --> 01:12:29,526
Come in, sir, come in.

918
01:12:47,207 --> 01:12:50,244
Bill, my boy. Glad to see ya.

919
01:12:51,767 --> 01:12:53,166
Who's um...

920
01:12:53,207 --> 01:12:54,560
Who's this?

921
01:12:54,607 --> 01:12:56,006
Only the boy.

922
01:12:56,047 --> 01:12:57,639
One of Mr Fagin's lads?

923
01:12:57,687 --> 01:12:59,086
Yeah. It's time.

924
01:12:59,127 --> 01:13:00,719
Right.

925
01:13:01,767 --> 01:13:03,485
Barkers for me, Barney.

926
01:13:11,687 --> 01:13:13,040
They're loaded.

927
01:13:13,087 --> 01:13:14,805
Good.

928
01:13:22,167 --> 01:13:24,158
- The persuaders?
- Got 'em.

929
01:13:29,007 --> 01:13:30,884
Keys. Centre bits.

930
01:13:34,647 --> 01:13:35,762
Darkies.

931
01:13:46,887 --> 01:13:48,081
Nothing forgotten?

932
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:51,159
Ah!

933
01:13:59,317 --> 01:14:00,909
(Whispers) It's all quiet.

934
01:14:37,637 --> 01:14:39,229
(Thunder)

935
01:14:49,557 --> 01:14:51,115
OLIVER: <i>I can't.</i>

936
01:14:51,157 --> 01:14:52,749
I can't.

937
01:14:52,797 --> 01:14:54,389
You will.

938
01:14:54,437 --> 01:14:56,473
It's Mr Brownlow's house.

939
01:15:24,757 --> 01:15:28,033
Have mercy! Don't make me steal from him!
Have mercy on me!

940
01:15:28,077 --> 01:15:29,476
Come here!

941
01:15:29,517 --> 01:15:33,635
For God's sake, let me run away
and die in a field. I'll never come near London.

942
01:15:33,677 --> 01:15:35,269
Shut it!

943
01:15:35,317 --> 01:15:38,115
Get up. Or I'll strew your brains on the grass.

944
01:16:18,477 --> 01:16:20,195
I'm putting you through there.

945
01:16:20,237 --> 01:16:23,035
Go to the front door and unfasten it.

946
01:16:23,077 --> 01:16:26,467
I can't. There's a bolt at the top.
I know it. I can't reach it.

947
01:16:26,517 --> 01:16:28,508
Well, stand on a chair or something.

948
01:16:28,557 --> 01:16:30,149
Just do it.

949
01:17:24,797 --> 01:17:26,389
BlLL: To the door!

950
01:17:26,437 --> 01:17:28,075
To the front door, damn you!

951
01:17:29,917 --> 01:17:31,475
MRS BEDWIN: <i>Who's there?</i>

952
01:17:32,997 --> 01:17:34,555
MR BROWNLOW: <i>Mrs Bedwin?</i>

953
01:17:34,597 --> 01:17:36,508
<i>Is that you?</i>

954
01:17:53,077 --> 01:17:55,352
Save me! Save me! Save me! For God's sake!

955
01:18:04,557 --> 01:18:07,117
MRS BEDWlN: <i>Help!</i>

956
01:18:07,157 --> 01:18:09,113
<i>Help!</i>

957
01:18:09,157 --> 01:18:10,510
<i>Police!</i>

958
01:18:19,397 --> 01:18:20,989
Give him here!

959
01:18:27,037 --> 01:18:28,709
God damnation, how he bleeds!

960
01:18:28,757 --> 01:18:31,510
- Is he hit bad?
- He's gotta be hit worse.

961
01:18:36,517 --> 01:18:38,747
- Give me a pistol!
- What?

962
01:18:39,797 --> 01:18:42,675
BILL: We've got to get rid of him or he'll squeal.

963
01:18:42,717 --> 01:18:44,150
We've got to do him in.

964
01:18:44,197 --> 01:18:45,789
Here, here!

965
01:18:45,837 --> 01:18:47,429
Down here by the river!

966
01:18:47,477 --> 01:18:48,910
TOBY: <i>Bill! Bill!</i>

967
01:18:52,357 --> 01:18:54,393
- Bill!
<i>- Help!</i>

968
01:18:55,437 --> 01:18:58,509
Help! Help!

969
01:18:58,557 --> 01:19:00,149
Oh, Bill!

970
01:19:00,197 --> 01:19:01,789
BILL: <i>Help!</i>

971
01:19:09,917 --> 01:19:11,509
CHARLEY: <i>Snap.</i>

972
01:19:12,557 --> 01:19:14,149
Snap.

973
01:19:16,197 --> 01:19:17,186
Snap!

974
01:19:20,117 --> 01:19:21,709
<i>Snap.</i>

975
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:23,748
(Bull's-eye whimpers)

976
01:19:23,797 --> 01:19:25,389
<i>Snap!</i>

977
01:19:38,957 --> 01:19:40,948
Well.

978
01:19:40,997 --> 01:19:42,749
How are you, Fagey?

979
01:19:42,797 --> 01:19:45,436
(Bull's-eye barks)
- Scarce!

980
01:19:45,477 --> 01:19:47,035
<i>Scarce!</i>

981
01:19:47,077 --> 01:19:48,635
<i>Where's Bill?</i>

982
01:19:48,677 --> 01:19:50,588
- He's bleeding.
- What happened?

983
01:19:50,637 --> 01:19:52,229
All in good time.

984
01:19:52,277 --> 01:19:55,587
I can't talk business till I've ate and drank.

985
01:20:02,717 --> 01:20:04,309
Nancy, I said, scarce.

986
01:20:04,357 --> 01:20:05,676
Scarce!

987
01:20:05,717 --> 01:20:07,116
Where's Bill?

988
01:20:07,157 --> 01:20:09,193
Produce the sustenance, if you please.

989
01:20:09,237 --> 01:20:10,829
Dodger.

990
01:20:10,877 --> 01:20:12,515
Nancy, scarce!

991
01:20:18,917 --> 01:20:21,511
- The crack failed.
<i>- I smelt that.</i>

992
01:20:21,557 --> 01:20:24,355
For the last time of asking, where's Bill?

993
01:20:26,077 --> 01:20:27,066
Dodger.

994
01:20:30,117 --> 01:20:32,551
Put him to bed. Give him a nip of gin.

995
01:20:39,957 --> 01:20:42,027
The boy was about to blow on us, Fagey.

996
01:20:43,077 --> 01:20:44,669
He was seen.

997
01:20:44,717 --> 01:20:47,072
Seen? He was seen? Who saw him?

998
01:20:47,117 --> 01:20:49,267
Two old 'uns.

999
01:20:49,317 --> 01:20:50,909
He shouted out.

1000
01:20:50,957 --> 01:20:53,232
Bill lost his head. Fired his pistol.

1001
01:20:53,277 --> 01:20:54,392
And hit the boy?

1002
01:20:54,437 --> 01:20:57,235
I dunno. There was two shots.
Only one was Bill's.

1003
01:20:58,277 --> 01:21:01,747
We made a run for it.
I had hold of the boy and Bill fell.

1004
01:21:01,797 --> 01:21:03,628
Fell? Was he hurt?

1005
01:21:03,677 --> 01:21:05,269
No.

1006
01:21:05,317 --> 01:21:07,035
Last seen he was swimming to London.

1007
01:21:09,357 --> 01:21:10,949
Hold up.

1008
01:21:14,317 --> 01:21:16,512
BILL: <i>I told you not to bring a soul here.</i>

1009
01:21:16,557 --> 01:21:18,229
<i>Now you've brought the devil.</i>

1010
01:21:19,277 --> 01:21:20,869
You said to fetch him.

1011
01:21:20,917 --> 01:21:23,715
His fever's that high, he don't remember nothing.

1012
01:21:24,717 --> 01:21:27,390
You're not well, are you, Bill?
How do you feel today?

1013
01:21:27,437 --> 01:21:29,428
I'm as weak as water.

1014
01:21:30,477 --> 01:21:32,115
Get us a drink.

1015
01:21:33,157 --> 01:21:35,796
<i>What evil wind has blowed you here?</i>

1016
01:21:35,837 --> 01:21:37,429
No evil wind, my dear.

1017
01:21:37,477 --> 01:21:38,876
(Chuckles)

1018
01:21:38,917 --> 01:21:42,034
You, Bill. You...you said we need to speak.

1019
01:21:46,917 --> 01:21:49,431
What have you done with that boy?
Where is he?

1020
01:21:49,477 --> 01:21:51,945
Safe and sound. The Dodger's minding him.

1021
01:21:51,997 --> 01:21:54,557
They're as close as Cain and Abel.

1022
01:21:58,317 --> 01:21:59,909
What about the boy, Bill?

1023
01:22:03,917 --> 01:22:06,226
We don't want anyone peaching on us, do we?

1024
01:22:06,277 --> 01:22:08,996
As long as that boy's alive,
we're as good as hung.

1025
01:22:09,037 --> 01:22:10,629
FAGIN: So what's to be done?

1026
01:22:12,717 --> 01:22:14,036
Nuffink.

1027
01:22:14,077 --> 01:22:15,669
"Nuffink."

1028
01:22:15,717 --> 01:22:17,628
- Not till I'm better.
- Then what?

1029
01:22:18,917 --> 01:22:21,670
- Then I'll do for him.
- How, Bill? Where?

1030
01:22:21,717 --> 01:22:23,389
Outside of London somewhere.

1031
01:22:23,437 --> 01:22:25,428
I'll find a river and I'll drown him.

1032
01:22:25,477 --> 01:22:27,069
The boy is weak.

1033
01:22:27,117 --> 01:22:30,427
Bill, he was wounded.
He can hardly stand, let alone walk.

1034
01:22:30,477 --> 01:22:32,752
When he can walk, tell me. I'll fetch him.

1035
01:22:34,557 --> 01:22:36,115
Now get out of here!

1036
01:22:36,157 --> 01:22:37,556
Yes.

1037
01:22:38,557 --> 01:22:39,785
Yes.

1038
01:22:40,837 --> 01:22:42,395
<i>Bill,</i>

1039
01:22:42,437 --> 01:22:44,029
you're right.

1040
01:22:47,317 --> 01:22:48,955
It's for the best.

1041
01:22:52,717 --> 01:22:54,309
I'm burning up.

1042
01:22:55,317 --> 01:22:57,228
Give me my physic. Where's my physic?

1043
01:22:59,317 --> 01:23:01,831
<i>You look like a corpse come back to life again.</i>

1044
01:23:01,877 --> 01:23:03,469
<i>What's the matter?</i>

1045
01:23:03,517 --> 01:23:05,109
Nothing.

1046
01:23:06,117 --> 01:23:07,869
What do you look at me so hard for?

1047
01:23:07,917 --> 01:23:09,555
What are you thinking of?

1048
01:23:09,597 --> 01:23:12,191
Of many things, Bill. What's in that?

1049
01:23:12,237 --> 01:23:13,829
<i>I'll tell you what it is.</i>

1050
01:23:13,877 --> 01:23:17,950
If you haven't caught the fever, then
there's something more than usual in the wind.

1051
01:23:17,997 --> 01:23:19,908
And something dangerous, too!

1052
01:23:21,957 --> 01:23:23,549
<i>Give me my physic, I say.</i>

1053
01:23:26,877 --> 01:23:28,993
No, no, no.

1054
01:23:30,157 --> 01:23:32,671
There ain't a stauncher-hearted girl going.

1055
01:23:33,717 --> 01:23:36,106
Or I'd have cut her throat three months ago.

1056
01:23:38,517 --> 01:23:40,189
She's got the fever coming on.

1057
01:23:40,237 --> 01:23:42,034
That's it.

1058
01:24:02,317 --> 01:24:04,592
Here you are. It'll make you feel better.

1059
01:24:11,917 --> 01:24:13,509
<i>Sit aside me.</i>

1060
01:24:16,317 --> 01:24:19,787
Put on your own face
or I'll alter it so you won't know it again.

1061
01:24:26,477 --> 01:24:28,707
(Bill sighs)

1062
01:24:36,077 --> 01:24:37,669
(Snoring)

1063
01:24:51,717 --> 01:24:53,196
(Bill stirs)

1064
01:25:41,717 --> 01:25:43,309
Wait.

1065
01:26:00,997 --> 01:26:02,191
Yes?

1066
01:26:02,237 --> 01:26:03,829
Does Mr Brownlow live here?

1067
01:26:03,877 --> 01:26:05,674
Who are you? What do you want?

1068
01:26:05,717 --> 01:26:07,309
Go round the back.

1069
01:26:07,357 --> 01:26:09,552
I have information about Oliver Twist.

1070
01:26:13,717 --> 01:26:15,992
Is he all right? Is he safe?

1071
01:26:17,037 --> 01:26:18,629
Where is he?

1072
01:26:18,677 --> 01:26:20,395
I will only talk to Mr Brownlow.

1073
01:26:20,437 --> 01:26:22,029
He's not here.

1074
01:26:23,277 --> 01:26:25,666
The boy is innocent. Tell him that.

1075
01:26:25,717 --> 01:26:27,787
Where is he?

1076
01:26:27,837 --> 01:26:29,429
Safe.

1077
01:26:30,677 --> 01:26:32,793
But he may not be for long.

1078
01:26:32,837 --> 01:26:34,111
Where is he?

1079
01:26:45,117 --> 01:26:46,709
Give Mr Brownlow a message.

1080
01:26:46,757 --> 01:26:50,227
Tell him to meet me on Sunday at midnight
on London bridge.

1081
01:26:50,277 --> 01:26:51,551
Midnight?

1082
01:26:51,597 --> 01:26:55,192
And if I'm not there, tell him to come
the next night and the next.

1083
01:26:55,237 --> 01:26:56,829
I'll be there. Tell him.

1084
01:27:03,317 --> 01:27:05,547
There, my dear. You look as good as new.

1085
01:27:07,117 --> 01:27:08,709
How do you feel?

1086
01:27:08,757 --> 01:27:10,349
Tired, sir.

1087
01:27:11,397 --> 01:27:12,989
Well, yes, it is...

1088
01:27:13,037 --> 01:27:14,629
long after midnight.

1089
01:27:14,677 --> 01:27:16,588
Shortly you'll sleep a good sleep,

1090
01:27:16,637 --> 01:27:19,788
but my meaning was
how do you feel in yourself, Oliver?

1091
01:27:19,837 --> 01:27:21,793
Better. Thank you, sir.

1092
01:27:21,837 --> 01:27:23,429
But for the ache in my arm.

1093
01:27:23,477 --> 01:27:25,069
Come sit.

1094
01:27:28,517 --> 01:27:32,305
I have the very thing
for such pains as yours, my dear.

1095
01:27:34,117 --> 01:27:35,709
Undo the bandage.

1096
01:27:42,397 --> 01:27:43,989
<i>Ah!</i>

1097
01:27:46,277 --> 01:27:48,666
Oh, my God!

1098
01:27:48,717 --> 01:27:50,787
It's a nasty wound.

1099
01:27:53,117 --> 01:27:56,632
But my magic will do the trick,
you'll see, my dear.

1100
01:27:56,677 --> 01:27:59,032
This remedy...

1101
01:27:59,077 --> 01:28:00,669
is older than time.

1102
01:28:00,717 --> 01:28:03,436
Yes, my dear, older than time.

1103
01:28:03,477 --> 01:28:06,469
It was handed down from father to son.

1104
01:28:06,517 --> 01:28:08,189
Father to son.

1105
01:28:09,197 --> 01:28:10,789
And comes from...

1106
01:28:12,837 --> 01:28:14,509
..who can say where?

1107
01:28:18,197 --> 01:28:19,789
Thank you, sir.

1108
01:28:19,837 --> 01:28:21,236
Thank you...

1109
01:28:21,277 --> 01:28:22,869
for your kindness.

1110
01:28:22,917 --> 01:28:24,509
I'll always remember it.

1111
01:28:24,557 --> 01:28:26,593
Well...

1112
01:28:28,637 --> 01:28:30,229
Always.

1113
01:28:30,277 --> 01:28:31,869
Yes, always, my dear.

1114
01:28:35,117 --> 01:28:37,347
But who knows how long that will be?

1115
01:28:43,677 --> 01:28:45,668
(Bell chimes 11 times)

1116
01:29:05,157 --> 01:29:07,113
An hour this side of midnight.

1117
01:29:08,117 --> 01:29:09,709
Dark and heavy it is, too.

1118
01:29:10,717 --> 01:29:12,389
Good night for business, this.

1119
01:29:12,437 --> 01:29:16,749
Ah, what a pity, Bill, my dear,
there's none quite ready to be done.

1120
01:29:16,797 --> 01:29:18,515
For once you're right.

1121
01:29:18,557 --> 01:29:21,629
<i>So, when will the boy be well enough</i>
<i>to go on his travels, then?</i>

1122
01:29:21,677 --> 01:29:24,111
FAGIN: <i>Like I say, Bill, in a day or two.</i>

1123
01:29:24,157 --> 01:29:25,749
BILL: <i>It's a pity.</i>

1124
01:29:25,797 --> 01:29:27,389
For I'm in the humour too.

1125
01:29:27,437 --> 01:29:29,189
Does me good to hear you.

1126
01:29:29,237 --> 01:29:32,752
You're like yourself tonight, Bill, eh?
Quite like yourself.

1127
01:29:32,797 --> 01:29:36,506
Well, I don't feel like myself when you lay
that withered old claw on my shoulder,

1128
01:29:36,557 --> 01:29:38,149
so take it away!

1129
01:29:46,117 --> 01:29:48,108
Hello, Nance.

1130
01:29:48,157 --> 01:29:50,512
And where's the girl going to this time of night?

1131
01:29:50,557 --> 01:29:52,149
Not far.

1132
01:29:52,197 --> 01:29:54,472
<i>What answer's that? Where are you going?</i>

1133
01:29:54,517 --> 01:29:56,109
I say, not far.

1134
01:29:56,157 --> 01:29:58,387
<i>- And I say where?</i>
- I dunno where.

1135
01:29:58,437 --> 01:30:00,029
<i>Then I do. Nowhere.</i>

1136
01:30:00,077 --> 01:30:01,669
<i>Sit down.</i>

1137
01:30:01,717 --> 01:30:03,469
I'm not well. I want a breath of air.

1138
01:30:03,517 --> 01:30:05,109
Put your head out the window.

1139
01:30:05,157 --> 01:30:08,354
There's not enough there. I want it in the street.

1140
01:30:08,397 --> 01:30:09,989
(Bull's-eye growls)

1141
01:30:11,837 --> 01:30:13,429
Then you won't have it.

1142
01:30:19,197 --> 01:30:22,633
There. Now stop quietly where you are, will ya?

1143
01:30:28,517 --> 01:30:30,235
Do you know what you're doing?

1144
01:30:31,277 --> 01:30:32,869
Do I know what I'm...?

1145
01:30:32,917 --> 01:30:36,512
I think this girl's lost her senses.
Are you talking to me in that way?

1146
01:30:36,557 --> 01:30:40,675
You'll drive me on to something desperate!
Now, let me go, will ya? This minute!

1147
01:30:40,717 --> 01:30:42,196
<i>- This instant!</i>
- No!

1148
01:30:42,237 --> 01:30:43,636
Tell him to let me go, Fagin.

1149
01:30:43,677 --> 01:30:45,554
<i>It'll be better for him.</i>

1150
01:30:45,597 --> 01:30:47,474
Do you hear me?

1151
01:30:48,517 --> 01:30:50,109
Aye.

1152
01:30:50,157 --> 01:30:51,749
I hear ya.

1153
01:30:52,797 --> 01:30:55,391
And if I have to listen to you
for half a minute longer,

1154
01:30:55,437 --> 01:30:59,669
the dog will have such a grip on your throat
as he'll tear some of that screaming voice out!

1155
01:30:59,717 --> 01:31:02,106
What's come over you, you jade? What is it?

1156
01:31:02,157 --> 01:31:04,671
(Tearfully) Bill, let me go!

1157
01:31:04,717 --> 01:31:06,708
Let me go!

1158
01:31:06,757 --> 01:31:08,634
You don't know what you're doing.

1159
01:31:08,677 --> 01:31:10,315
Look, for only one hour.

1160
01:31:10,357 --> 01:31:14,669
Cut my limbs off one by one
if I don't think the girl's stark raving mad. Get up.

1161
01:31:14,717 --> 01:31:16,309
Get up!

1162
01:31:16,357 --> 01:31:17,585
No!

1163
01:31:17,637 --> 01:31:18,308
Argh!

1164
01:31:19,757 --> 01:31:21,349
(Nancy squeals and whimpers)

1165
01:31:24,117 --> 01:31:25,789
BILL: <i>Now stay there!</i>

1166
01:31:27,837 --> 01:31:30,192
What a precious strange girl that is.

1167
01:31:30,237 --> 01:31:32,353
You may say that, Bill, you may say that.

1168
01:31:32,397 --> 01:31:35,469
What do you think she took it
in her head to go out tonight for?

1169
01:31:35,517 --> 01:31:37,826
Obstinacy. Women's obstinacy, I suppose.

1170
01:31:37,877 --> 01:31:39,469
I thought I tamed her of that.

1171
01:31:39,517 --> 01:31:41,269
She's as bad as ever.

1172
01:31:43,317 --> 01:31:46,992
I think she's got a touch of my fever
in her blood yet and it won't come out.

1173
01:31:47,037 --> 01:31:48,629
Like enough.

1174
01:31:48,677 --> 01:31:51,555
If she's taken that way again,
I'll let her a little blood.

1175
01:31:51,597 --> 01:31:53,553
Without troubling the doctor!

1176
01:31:53,597 --> 01:31:55,110
(Door opens)

1177
01:31:55,157 --> 01:31:57,148
(Nancy laughs happily)

1178
01:32:08,917 --> 01:32:11,067
Why, now she's on the other tack.

1179
01:32:11,117 --> 01:32:12,709
(Nancy giggles)

1180
01:32:12,757 --> 01:32:14,349
Good night.

1181
01:32:14,397 --> 01:32:18,549
In two days, Bill, come for the boy.

1182
01:32:18,597 --> 01:32:20,428
(Nancy chuckles)

1183
01:32:20,477 --> 01:32:22,069
BILL: <i>Light him down.</i>

1184
01:32:23,117 --> 01:32:26,996
It's a pity he should fall and break his neck
without anyone seeing it.

1185
01:32:28,517 --> 01:32:30,269
Show him a light.

1186
01:32:39,317 --> 01:32:42,275
What is it, Nancy, dear, the reason for all this?

1187
01:32:42,317 --> 01:32:43,716
What do you mean?

1188
01:32:43,757 --> 01:32:45,349
That matter just now.

1189
01:32:45,397 --> 01:32:46,989
We'll speak of this anon.

1190
01:32:47,037 --> 01:32:49,232
You have a friend in me, Nance.

1191
01:32:49,277 --> 01:32:51,791
A staunch friend. You know me of old, Nance.

1192
01:32:51,837 --> 01:32:53,429
I know you well.

1193
01:32:53,477 --> 01:32:54,990
Good night.

1194
01:33:00,277 --> 01:33:01,232
Dodge.

1195
01:33:01,277 --> 01:33:02,869
Pull it in.

1196
01:33:02,917 --> 01:33:04,509
(Coughing)

1197
01:33:14,717 --> 01:33:16,309
Trouble.

1198
01:33:20,117 --> 01:33:21,709
Dodger!

1199
01:33:27,917 --> 01:33:29,828
WOMAN: Shall we both take him home?

1200
01:33:35,917 --> 01:33:37,509
Something up?

1201
01:33:39,917 --> 01:33:41,509
I...

1202
01:33:43,317 --> 01:33:47,947
I want you to do a piece of work for me
that requires great care and caution.

1203
01:33:48,997 --> 01:33:52,910
What is it? I ain't going near no police office.
That don't suit me, that don't.

1204
01:33:52,957 --> 01:33:56,552
There's not the smallest danger in it,
not the smallest.

1205
01:33:56,597 --> 01:33:58,474
I want someone dodged.

1206
01:33:58,517 --> 01:34:00,109
Who? An old 'un?

1207
01:34:00,157 --> 01:34:01,749
- Young 'un.
- Who is she?

1208
01:34:01,797 --> 01:34:03,196
- One of us.
- Who?

1209
01:34:03,237 --> 01:34:04,829
- (Fagin mouths)
- Nancy?

1210
01:34:04,877 --> 01:34:05,832
Shh!

1211
01:34:07,277 --> 01:34:08,676
What's she been up to?

1212
01:34:08,717 --> 01:34:12,471
I'm not sure she's been up to anything, my dear.
That's why I want her dodged.

1213
01:34:12,517 --> 01:34:13,233
She...

1214
01:34:15,317 --> 01:34:18,434
She may have wanted to talk to people
she shouldn't want to talk to.

1215
01:34:18,477 --> 01:34:22,072
I want to know where she goes, who she sees,
what she says.

1216
01:34:24,917 --> 01:34:26,509
Nancy?

1217
01:34:26,557 --> 01:34:29,025
I don't know. She's a good 'un is Nancy.

1218
01:34:30,037 --> 01:34:31,629
A pound, my dear.

1219
01:34:31,677 --> 01:34:33,269
One whole pound.

1220
01:34:36,917 --> 01:34:38,509
Oh!

1221
01:35:12,517 --> 01:35:14,109
Mr Brownlow?

1222
01:35:16,517 --> 01:35:18,269
Yes.

1223
01:35:21,317 --> 01:35:24,309
I'm afraid to speak to you here.
Come away. Follow me.

1224
01:35:38,117 --> 01:35:39,709
This is far enough.

1225
01:35:39,757 --> 01:35:41,349
Why can't we speak up there?

1226
01:35:41,397 --> 01:35:42,989
I told you, I'm afraid.

1227
01:35:43,037 --> 01:35:44,629
I may be followed.

1228
01:35:49,317 --> 01:35:51,273
I'm here because you told my housekeeper

1229
01:35:51,317 --> 01:35:54,115
that you have information
concerning the boy Oliver Twist.

1230
01:35:54,157 --> 01:35:56,432
- So I have.
- Tell me.

1231
01:35:57,477 --> 01:36:01,595
He's being held by the devil,
and he's handing him over to another what...

1232
01:36:01,637 --> 01:36:04,105
means to...

1233
01:36:04,157 --> 01:36:06,625
I must know more. Is it someone close to you?

1234
01:36:06,677 --> 01:36:08,269
One is.

1235
01:36:08,317 --> 01:36:10,035
One ain't.

1236
01:36:10,077 --> 01:36:12,671
These men, whoever they are,
must be delivered up by you.

1237
01:36:12,717 --> 01:36:13,991
Never.

1238
01:36:14,037 --> 01:36:17,552
Bad a life as he has led, I've led a bad life, too,
and I will not turn upon him.

1239
01:36:18,597 --> 01:36:20,189
The other.

1240
01:36:20,237 --> 01:36:22,228
Fagin.

1241
01:36:22,277 --> 01:36:23,676
He has the boy.

1242
01:36:23,717 --> 01:36:26,026
- Fagin?
- Find Fagin and you find the boy.

1243
01:36:26,077 --> 01:36:28,272
- Where is he?
- Spitalfields.

1244
01:36:28,317 --> 01:36:30,512
That's all I'll say. I've said too much.

1245
01:36:31,717 --> 01:36:34,311
No-one must never know who told you. Promise.

1246
01:36:34,357 --> 01:36:36,587
I promise.

1247
01:36:36,637 --> 01:36:39,310
- Tomorrow I'll put the matter before the police.
- No.

1248
01:36:39,357 --> 01:36:40,949
You must do it tonight.

1249
01:36:40,997 --> 01:36:43,113
Just say Fagin and the traps will know.

1250
01:36:43,157 --> 01:36:44,749
- "The traps"?
- The police.

1251
01:36:45,797 --> 01:36:47,389
What can I do to serve you?

1252
01:36:47,437 --> 01:36:49,029
Nothing.

1253
01:36:49,077 --> 01:36:50,669
<i>You can do nothing.</i>

1254
01:36:50,717 --> 01:36:52,309
<i>l am past all hope indeed.</i>

1255
01:36:52,357 --> 01:36:54,348
MR BROWNLOW: <i>Take this. As a reward.</i>

1256
01:36:54,397 --> 01:36:55,989
NANCY: <i>No.</i>

1257
01:36:56,037 --> 01:36:57,629
<i>I've not done this for money.</i>

1258
01:36:57,677 --> 01:36:59,269
<i>God bless you.</i>

1259
01:36:59,317 --> 01:37:00,909
<i>Good night.</i>

1260
01:37:00,957 --> 01:37:02,549
<i>Goodbye.</i>

1261
01:37:02,597 --> 01:37:04,235
<i>Never,</i>

1262
01:37:04,277 --> 01:37:05,915
<i>never say who told you.</i>

1263
01:37:16,477 --> 01:37:18,513
FAGIN: <i>Look at him.</i>

1264
01:37:19,557 --> 01:37:21,149
What a shame it is.

1265
01:37:21,197 --> 01:37:24,507
With his face,
he could pick old ladies' pockets in church.

1266
01:37:24,557 --> 01:37:26,866
His face could be a fortune to us.

1267
01:37:28,117 --> 01:37:29,709
Are you changing your mind?

1268
01:37:29,757 --> 01:37:31,349
No.

1269
01:37:32,597 --> 01:37:34,189
No, Bill, it has to be done.

1270
01:37:34,237 --> 01:37:36,751
DODGER: <i>Fagin! Fagin!</i>

1271
01:37:41,517 --> 01:37:43,109
What's got into you, Dodger?

1272
01:37:43,157 --> 01:37:44,556
I have to see Fagin alone.

1273
01:37:44,597 --> 01:37:47,555
- No, no, my dear, you can speak in front of Bill.
- No, I can't.

1274
01:37:47,597 --> 01:37:49,667
Yes, you can. Speak, Dodger. Tell us.

1275
01:37:49,717 --> 01:37:51,309
(Whispers) Nancy...

1276
01:37:51,357 --> 01:37:52,756
What about Nancy?

1277
01:37:52,797 --> 01:37:55,470
He done a bit of work for me, Bill.
I had him dodge Nancy.

1278
01:37:55,517 --> 01:37:57,109
What do you mean?

1279
01:37:57,157 --> 01:37:59,068
Tell us, Dodger. You followed her?

1280
01:37:59,117 --> 01:38:00,516
Yes.

1281
01:38:00,557 --> 01:38:01,956
To London Bridge.

1282
01:38:01,997 --> 01:38:04,147
And, what? What at London Bridge?

1283
01:38:04,197 --> 01:38:06,153
She met an old 'un. A gentleman.

1284
01:38:06,197 --> 01:38:07,789
And...

1285
01:38:07,837 --> 01:38:09,429
And? Speak, will ya!

1286
01:38:11,117 --> 01:38:12,709
She peached!

1287
01:38:12,757 --> 01:38:14,429
She told him Fagin had Oliver!

1288
01:38:14,477 --> 01:38:17,469
And the old man wants to go to the traps!
Now, tonight!

1289
01:38:18,517 --> 01:38:20,235
(Bill groans)

1290
01:38:23,837 --> 01:38:26,226
- Let me go! Let me out!
- Bill! Bill! A word?

1291
01:38:26,277 --> 01:38:28,074
Don't speak to me! It's not safe!

1292
01:38:28,117 --> 01:38:29,709
Hear me speak a word.

1293
01:38:29,757 --> 01:38:31,349
<i>Bill, you won't be...</i>

1294
01:38:33,557 --> 01:38:35,548
You won't be too violent, Bill?

1295
01:38:48,317 --> 01:38:52,390
Flit, boys, flit! The traps will be at the door
before you can say Spitalfields.

1296
01:38:52,437 --> 01:38:54,029
Flit, flit, flit!

1297
01:38:55,517 --> 01:38:56,472
Flit!

1298
01:38:57,357 --> 01:38:58,312
Flit!

1299
01:38:59,037 --> 01:39:00,629
Flit!

1300
01:39:01,677 --> 01:39:03,269
Flit!

1301
01:39:06,037 --> 01:39:07,106
Flit!

1302
01:39:33,317 --> 01:39:34,909
Come on.

1303
01:39:59,117 --> 01:40:00,709
Oh, it's you.

1304
01:40:04,757 --> 01:40:06,349
Bill?

1305
01:40:06,397 --> 01:40:07,989
What's the matter?

1306
01:40:16,117 --> 01:40:18,108
Bill, why do you look like that at me?

1307
01:40:20,317 --> 01:40:22,785
There's enough light for what I've got to do.

1308
01:40:22,837 --> 01:40:24,429
What... What have I done?

1309
01:40:25,477 --> 01:40:27,069
Speak to me!

1310
01:40:27,117 --> 01:40:29,153
You know.

1311
01:40:29,197 --> 01:40:31,631
You was watched tonight.

1312
01:40:31,677 --> 01:40:33,315
Every word you said was heard.

1313
01:40:36,317 --> 01:40:37,909
I never said your name, Bill.

1314
01:40:37,957 --> 01:40:39,549
Never.

1315
01:40:39,597 --> 01:40:41,189
Never...

1316
01:40:41,237 --> 01:40:42,829
Bill... Bill.

1317
01:40:42,877 --> 01:40:45,072
Bill!

1318
01:40:46,117 --> 01:40:47,550
Oh, God have mercy.

1319
01:41:10,757 --> 01:41:12,349
Nance?

1320
01:41:17,317 --> 01:41:18,909
Nance?

1321
01:41:20,717 --> 01:41:22,947
(Gasps)

1322
01:41:22,997 --> 01:41:24,430
(Caws)

1323
01:41:39,917 --> 01:41:41,509
I haven't done nothing.

1324
01:41:41,557 --> 01:41:43,149
Be off with you.

1325
01:42:06,637 --> 01:42:08,229
Hello, Fagey.

1326
01:42:08,277 --> 01:42:09,869
Hello, lads.

1327
01:42:11,837 --> 01:42:14,032
What's the news, Toby, what's the news?

1328
01:42:14,077 --> 01:42:15,669
I have it here, Fagin.

1329
01:42:15,717 --> 01:42:17,309
It's all in the Chronicle.

1330
01:42:17,357 --> 01:42:18,756
You're in it.

1331
01:42:18,797 --> 01:42:20,947
Bill's in it. Oliver's in it.

1332
01:42:20,997 --> 01:42:25,309
The Chronicle?
Fancy that, you're famous, Fagin.

1333
01:42:25,357 --> 01:42:26,995
Read it.

1334
01:42:27,037 --> 01:42:29,949
"More information
has reached your correspondent

1335
01:42:29,997 --> 01:42:34,070
concerning the foul and bestial murder
that took place in Spitalfields

1336
01:42:34,117 --> 01:42:36,995
and which has shocked and appalled
the citizens of London.

1337
01:42:37,037 --> 01:42:38,629
(Toby laughs)

1338
01:42:38,677 --> 01:42:43,671
It is believed that the victim,
a young woman, now identified as Nancy,

1339
01:42:43,717 --> 01:42:46,675
was brutally beaten to death...

1340
01:42:46,717 --> 01:42:49,390
<i>by one William Sykes,</i>

1341
01:42:49,437 --> 01:42:51,314
a well-known dangerous villain.

1342
01:42:52,317 --> 01:42:53,909
The motive is as yet unclear,

1343
01:42:53,957 --> 01:42:55,948
but your correspondent has learned

1344
01:42:55,997 --> 01:42:59,546
that the murdered woman
had informed on her associate

1345
01:42:59,597 --> 01:43:02,430
and on an infamous fence, Fagin,

1346
01:43:03,477 --> 01:43:08,426
<i>who is now wanted for the abduction</i>
<i>of a young boy, Oliver Twist.</i>

1347
01:43:08,477 --> 01:43:10,752
(Toby chuckles gleefully)

1348
01:43:10,797 --> 01:43:13,231
Neither Fagin nor Sykes
are presently in custody,

1349
01:43:13,277 --> 01:43:18,067
but the police are engaged in searching for 'em
throughout the city and beyond.

1350
01:43:19,117 --> 01:43:25,989
<i>Sykes, according to the police,</i>
<i>is usually accompanied by a fierce white dog."</i>

1351
01:43:28,117 --> 01:43:29,835
How about that, eh?

1352
01:43:39,277 --> 01:43:41,074
(Bill whistles)

1353
01:43:41,917 --> 01:43:42,827
<i>Come.</i>

1354
01:43:42,877 --> 01:43:44,469
Come back here.

1355
01:43:47,757 --> 01:43:49,668
We're going back to London.

1356
01:43:51,517 --> 01:43:53,633
I'll have people to speak to.

1357
01:43:53,677 --> 01:43:56,271
I'll force shiners out of Fagin. Get to France.

1358
01:43:56,317 --> 01:43:58,592
Damn me, we'll risk it.

1359
01:44:03,037 --> 01:44:04,629
MAN: <i>Who's he done in?</i>

1360
01:44:08,277 --> 01:44:09,710
He done in a woman?

1361
01:44:33,797 --> 01:44:35,196
(Bill whistles)

1362
01:44:35,237 --> 01:44:36,875
<i>Bull's-eye!</i>

1363
01:44:36,917 --> 01:44:39,147
Don't you hear me when I whistle?

1364
01:44:40,197 --> 01:44:41,789
You gone deaf or something?

1365
01:44:43,877 --> 01:44:45,993
Come here. Come on.

1366
01:44:47,037 --> 01:44:49,346
<i>I ain't gonna harm you. Come on.</i>

1367
01:44:49,397 --> 01:44:52,389
Come on, Bull's-eye. Come here.

1368
01:44:53,877 --> 01:44:55,469
Stop it!

1369
01:44:55,517 --> 01:44:58,793
I'm warning you! Let go of it!
I ain't playing with you!

1370
01:44:58,837 --> 01:45:01,397
Let it go, you stinking varmint!

1371
01:45:01,437 --> 01:45:03,029
Bull's-eye!

1372
01:45:03,077 --> 01:45:04,669
(Bull's-eye growls)

1373
01:45:07,517 --> 01:45:08,996
<i>Bull's-eye!</i>

1374
01:45:09,037 --> 01:45:10,470
<i>Bull's-eye.</i>

1375
01:45:10,517 --> 01:45:13,031
Get back here! Get back here!

1376
01:45:13,077 --> 01:45:15,033
(Bill sighs)

1377
01:45:15,077 --> 01:45:16,396
Damn!

1378
01:45:21,397 --> 01:45:22,989
Ah, it's his dog.

1379
01:45:23,037 --> 01:45:24,629
It's his dog!

1380
01:45:30,317 --> 01:45:31,909
Here, boy.

1381
01:45:31,957 --> 01:45:33,948
- Here.
- Don't go near him.

1382
01:45:40,317 --> 01:45:42,990
There is a child in danger, Inspector Blathers.

1383
01:45:43,037 --> 01:45:46,507
But you only seem interested in apprehending
this man William Sykes.

1384
01:45:46,557 --> 01:45:49,230
Your concern should be for the safety of the boy.

1385
01:45:49,277 --> 01:45:53,031
Allow me to say, sir,
this is our usual way of doing business.

1386
01:45:54,077 --> 01:45:55,829
<i>My thinking is this.</i>

1387
01:45:55,877 --> 01:45:58,437
If we get Sykes, we get Fagin.

1388
01:45:58,477 --> 01:46:00,513
And if we get Fagin...

1389
01:46:00,557 --> 01:46:03,151
Sir, we've found the dog.

1390
01:46:05,917 --> 01:46:08,989
Are we going to sit here all night
waiting for the traps to find us?

1391
01:46:09,037 --> 01:46:10,436
Shut it.

1392
01:46:10,477 --> 01:46:12,069
No, he's right.

1393
01:46:12,117 --> 01:46:13,709
We should do another flit.

1394
01:46:15,517 --> 01:46:17,109
(Knocking)

1395
01:46:17,157 --> 01:46:18,749
The traps!

1396
01:46:33,797 --> 01:46:34,946
What?

1397
01:46:34,997 --> 01:46:36,510
It's him.

1398
01:46:36,557 --> 01:46:38,149
DODGER: <i>Don't let him in.</i>

1399
01:46:38,197 --> 01:46:40,188
We must.

1400
01:46:40,237 --> 01:46:41,829
Go on.

1401
01:46:44,877 --> 01:46:46,469
Go on!

1402
01:46:46,517 --> 01:46:48,109
Ah, you...

1403
01:46:52,317 --> 01:46:53,909
Don't leave us in the dark.

1404
01:47:48,517 --> 01:47:50,109
Damn you all.

1405
01:47:51,117 --> 01:47:52,709
<i>Have you nothing to say to me?</i>

1406
01:47:53,957 --> 01:47:56,266
It's not safe for you to stop here, Bill.

1407
01:47:56,317 --> 01:47:59,115
If it's safe for you, it's safe for me.

1408
01:48:02,997 --> 01:48:04,589
Is it...

1409
01:48:05,637 --> 01:48:07,150
The body, is it buried?

1410
01:48:08,517 --> 01:48:10,109
(Barking)

1411
01:48:14,997 --> 01:48:16,589
Dodger, let him in, quick.

1412
01:48:18,717 --> 01:48:20,787
<i>Dodger.</i>

1413
01:48:21,837 --> 01:48:23,589
<i>Do as I say.</i>

1414
01:48:27,317 --> 01:48:29,547
DODGER: <i>Don't come near me, you monster.</i>

1415
01:48:32,717 --> 01:48:35,277
You're my witnesses. I'm not afraid of him.

1416
01:48:36,317 --> 01:48:38,990
<i>And it they come here after him, I'll give him up.</i>

1417
01:48:39,037 --> 01:48:40,755
I'll tell 'em you're here.

1418
01:48:42,397 --> 01:48:45,355
He may kill me if he likes,
but if I'm here I'll give him up.

1419
01:48:45,397 --> 01:48:47,706
If he was to be boiled alive, so I would!

1420
01:48:47,757 --> 01:48:50,066
- Why, you little...
- Yargh!

1421
01:48:53,117 --> 01:48:56,109
BlLL: I'll tear you limb from limb.

1422
01:49:00,237 --> 01:49:02,956
Help! He's here! He's here!
Break down the door!

1423
01:49:02,997 --> 01:49:04,635
Help!

1424
01:49:04,677 --> 01:49:06,076
<i>Come on, please!</i>

Damn you all! Do your worst! I'll cheat you yet!

1427
01:49:23,117 --> 01:49:26,666
No! Bill, no! He's our bargaining tool.

1428
01:49:26,717 --> 01:49:28,867
Not yours, Fagin. Mine.

1429

Come on.

1432
01:49:47,277 --> 01:49:49,745
- Don't fire.
- Hold your fire, men. Hold your fire.

1433
01:49:49,797 --> 01:49:51,389
I'll let the boy go.

1434
01:49:51,437 --> 01:49:53,029
I'll let him drop.

1435
01:49:53,077 --> 01:49:55,989
Don't try nothing or I'll let him go!

BILL: Grab hold of that! Grab hold of it!

1437
01:50:26,117 --> 01:50:28,108
We must give chase, sir.

(Shouting)

1439
01:51:24,437 --> 01:51:25,836
Grab it!

1440
01:51:26,837 --> 01:51:28,429
Grab it!

01:52:50,997 --> 01:52:52,589
<i>Oliver?</i>

1448
01:52:57,797 --> 01:52:59,196
Here he is, sir.

1449
01:52:59,237 --> 01:53:01,034
MR BROWNLOW: <i>Come along, my boy!</i>

1450
01:53:01,077 --> 01:53:03,193
<i>Mr Grimwig has something to say to you.</i>

1451
01:53:05,597 --> 01:53:07,189
Do the honours, Mrs Bedwin.

1452
01:53:07,237 --> 01:53:11,150
Now, then, young man,
I confess I misjudged you.

1453
01:53:12,197 --> 01:53:15,951
Truth to tell, I feared your benefactor
would make me eat my head.

1454
01:53:16,997 --> 01:53:19,830
But he's a good friend and has pardoned me.

1455
01:53:19,877 --> 01:53:21,674
MR BROWNLOW: <i>And one for Oliver.</i>

1456
01:53:21,717 --> 01:53:23,435
OLIVER: <i>Thank you, sir.</i>
- So...

1457
01:53:23,477 --> 01:53:27,106
- And you too, Mrs Bedwin.
- Oh, I don't know as I should, sir.

1458
01:53:27,157 --> 01:53:31,196
So, I'll take the liberty, if you'll allow me,
to salute you.

1459
01:53:31,237 --> 01:53:32,989
<i>To Sam Waters.</i>

1460
01:53:33,037 --> 01:53:34,755
Oliver Twist.

1461
01:53:34,797 --> 01:53:36,389
Ah, Oliver Twist.

1462
01:53:36,437 --> 01:53:38,155
To Oliver Twist.

1463
01:53:42,477 --> 01:53:44,308
Why, Oliver...

1464
01:53:44,357 --> 01:53:45,949
my child, what's the matter?

1465
01:53:47,397 --> 01:53:49,547
Why are you so sad?

1466
01:53:59,317 --> 01:54:00,909
(Hammering)

1467
01:54:15,117 --> 01:54:18,553
Are you certain, Oliver,
you wish to go through with this?

1468
01:54:18,597 --> 01:54:20,189
Yes, sir.

1469
01:54:20,237 --> 01:54:22,114
Certain.

1470
01:54:27,717 --> 01:54:29,309
MAN: <i>Yes?</i>

1471
01:55:12,717 --> 01:55:14,833
Is the young gentleman to come too, sir?

1472
01:55:15,877 --> 01:55:17,993
It's not a sight for children, sir.

1473
01:55:18,037 --> 01:55:20,153
It is not indeed, my friend.

1474
01:55:20,197 --> 01:55:24,588
But this child has seen this man
in the full career of his success and villainy,

1475
01:55:24,637 --> 01:55:28,789
and it is his wish, even at the cost of
some pain and fear, that he should see him now.

1476
01:56:00,317 --> 01:56:01,909
18.

1477
01:56:16,757 --> 01:56:18,748
Ho, hey!

1478
01:56:22,717 --> 01:56:24,309
FAGIN: <i>Good boy.</i>

1479
01:56:24,357 --> 01:56:25,949
<i>Good boy, Charley.</i>

1480
01:56:25,997 --> 01:56:27,589
<i>Well done.</i>

1481
01:56:27,637 --> 01:56:29,229
(Fagin mumbles)

1482
01:56:35,557 --> 01:56:37,468
Good boy, Charley, well done. Well done.

1483
01:56:37,517 --> 01:56:39,906
Take, take, take the boy away to bed.

1484
01:56:39,957 --> 01:56:42,187
Don't be frightened. Fagin.

1485
01:56:43,237 --> 01:56:44,909
That's me. An old man, my lord.

1486
01:56:45,957 --> 01:56:47,788
A very old, old man.

1487
01:56:47,837 --> 01:56:49,748
There's someone here who wants to see you.

1488
01:56:49,797 --> 01:56:51,469
Strike! Strike them all dead!

1489
01:56:51,517 --> 01:56:53,826
What right have they to butcher me?

1490
01:56:53,877 --> 01:56:55,993
Speak to him now. Quick, if you please.

1491
01:56:56,037 --> 01:56:58,073
For he grows worse as the time goes on.

1492
01:57:00,117 --> 01:57:01,516
Fagin.

1493
01:57:01,557 --> 01:57:02,956
You were kind to me.

1494
01:57:02,997 --> 01:57:04,589
Yes, yes.

1495
01:57:04,637 --> 01:57:07,231
I'll be kind again. I'll be kind again.

1496
01:57:08,277 --> 01:57:09,869
I'll be kind again.

1497
01:57:14,917 --> 01:57:16,509
I'm not afraid.

1498
01:57:16,557 --> 01:57:18,149
Oliver!

1499
01:57:21,237 --> 01:57:23,228
(Fagin sobs)

1500
01:57:23,277 --> 01:57:24,869
Let me whisper to you.

1501
01:57:27,917 --> 01:57:29,509
You remember the box?

1502
01:57:29,557 --> 01:57:31,149
Oliver?

1503
01:57:31,197 --> 01:57:34,109
With my pretty things for my old age, Oliver?

1504
01:57:34,157 --> 01:57:37,354
It's hid a little way up the chimney
in the top front room.

1505
01:57:37,397 --> 01:57:38,989
It's yours, Oliver.

1506
01:57:39,037 --> 01:57:40,356
Yours.

1507
01:57:40,397 --> 01:57:42,069
- But we must talk.
- Yes, yes.

1508
01:57:42,117 --> 01:57:44,870
But shall we say a prayer together first?

1509
01:57:44,917 --> 01:57:46,509
Do.

1510
01:57:46,557 --> 01:57:48,468
Say only one, upon your knees.

1511
01:57:48,517 --> 01:57:50,109
With me.

1512
01:57:50,157 --> 01:57:51,749
And we can talk all morning.

1513
01:57:53,437 --> 01:57:55,268
Outside. Outside.

1514
01:57:55,317 --> 01:57:58,389
You can say I've gone to sleep
and they'll believe you.

1515
01:57:58,437 --> 01:58:02,066
You can get me out
and the pretty things are yours, my dear. Yours!

1516
01:58:02,117 --> 01:58:03,835
Oh, God, forgive this wretched man.

1517
01:58:03,877 --> 01:58:05,469
That's right.

1518
01:58:05,517 --> 01:58:07,712
That's right. That will help us on.

1519
01:58:07,757 --> 01:58:09,349
If... If... If...

1520
01:58:10,397 --> 01:58:15,755
If I shake and tremble as we pass the gallows,
don't...don't...

1521
01:58:16,757 --> 01:58:18,349
..don't you mind, hurry on.

1522
01:58:18,397 --> 01:58:19,989
Now, now, now.

1523
01:58:20,037 --> 01:58:21,834
WARDER: <i>Have you more to say to him, sir?</i>

1524
01:58:21,877 --> 01:58:24,186
- Nothing more.
- You'd better leave him.

1525
01:58:24,237 --> 01:58:25,829
Press on, press on. Press on.

1526
01:58:25,877 --> 01:58:27,469
Press on, press on.

1527
01:58:28,757 --> 01:58:30,634
Softly, softly. No, no, slow.

1528
01:58:30,677 --> 01:58:32,269
Faster.

1529
01:58:32,317 --> 01:58:33,909
Faster, faster!

1530
01:58:33,957 --> 01:58:36,312
Faster! Faster!

1531
01:58:36,357 --> 01:58:37,949
<i>Faster, faster!</i>

1532
01:58:37,997 --> 01:58:40,272
<i>Faster!</i>

1533
01:58:40,317 --> 01:58:41,909
(Fagin howls)
