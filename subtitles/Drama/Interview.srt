1
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:46,372
I'm not just saying this
'cause you're my brother.

2
00:00:46,477 --> 00:00:47,985
Or even DC.

3
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,665
I'm telling you Robert.

4
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,046
These cowboys are going down.

5
00:00:52,151 --> 00:00:54,324
But do I get to cover Washington?

6
00:00:54,428 --> 00:00:56,043
No.

7
00:00:56,148 --> 00:00:58,267
I have the unique privilege...

8
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:01,526
...of interviewing Katya.

9
00:01:04,255 --> 00:01:06,340
Do you know who she is?

10
00:01:07,339 --> 00:01:12,094
I mean she's more famous for
who she sleeps with than anything else.

11
00:01:12,199 --> 00:01:15,283
And for her fluctuating tit size.

12
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:21,743
She's a real maverick, this one.
She's had them reduced.

13
00:01:22,418 --> 00:01:23,414
Too bad for me, huh?

14
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,240
Now I've got nothing
to look forward to.

15
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:37,288
Hey, I'd offer you one. But it would be
like spitting in the ocean, right?

16
00:01:42,647 --> 00:01:44,733
Robert.

17
00:01:51,597 --> 00:01:54,522
I know you like big tits.

18
00:01:54,868 --> 00:01:56,142
Remember that night?

19
00:01:56,143 --> 00:02:00,466
Remember the night I danced with Tiria,
when I first introduced you to Brenda?

20
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,884
I brought her over and you looked
right at her chest and you said:

21
00:02:03,988 --> 00:02:07,075
'It's nice to meet you both.'

22
00:02:08,218 --> 00:02:10,345
She liked you. You know.

23
00:02:17,196 --> 00:02:21,272
Well, I don't want to keep
her majesty waiting.

24
00:02:35,137 --> 00:02:37,222
You're gonna be okay.

25
00:02:38,876 --> 00:02:40,961
Come on. You know that.

26
00:02:42,785 --> 00:02:44,871
All right?

27
00:02:52,096 --> 00:02:54,181
It's not fair, is it?

28
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,976
I know.

29
00:02:57,702 --> 00:02:59,786
That's not fair.

30
00:03:01,824 --> 00:03:03,909
I know.

31
00:03:05,187 --> 00:03:07,272
Don't be afraid.

32
00:03:20,345 --> 00:03:23,358
God, I hate my character.

33
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:25,550
Should we run at it again?

34
00:03:25,655 --> 00:03:28,344
No. I think I'm supposed
to be somewhere.

35
00:03:28,448 --> 00:03:32,411
'Do you realize
everybody loves you now?'

36
00:03:32,515 --> 00:03:34,600
Shit. I'm late.

37
00:04:00,906 --> 00:04:01,946
Come on, Larry.

38
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,036
There's gonna be more indictments.

39
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,305
This is just the crack on the dam.
Kidding me?

40
00:04:08,502 --> 00:04:13,583
You know if I get on a train within the hour,
I could be in Washington by midnight.

41
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:14,739
Well.

42
00:04:14,843 --> 00:04:16,675
I mean she's not even here.

43
00:04:16,779 --> 00:04:17,273
Sir!

44
00:04:17,377 --> 00:04:18,943
Hold on.
Maybe she called.

45
00:04:19,047 --> 00:04:23,113
I'm sorry sir but we do have
a policy about cell phones.

46
00:04:23,217 --> 00:04:25,302
Okay. I'm sorry.

47
00:04:27,202 --> 00:04:28,638
Still there?

48
00:04:28,742 --> 00:04:30,494
Yeah. Look, I'm ready to split.

49
00:04:30,598 --> 00:04:32,992
I can leave right now.

50
00:04:33,566 --> 00:04:36,669
No. We definitely said seven.

51
00:04:37,718 --> 00:04:40,990
Well, maybe she doesn't
know how to tell time.

52
00:04:41,094 --> 00:04:42,793
Why am I so hostile?

53
00:04:42,897 --> 00:04:46,442
I've been waiting
almost an hour already.

54
00:04:48,574 --> 00:04:49,964
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:51,216
How are you?

56
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,331
Newsworld?

57
00:04:52,435 --> 00:04:53,600
I'm from Newsworld.

58
00:04:53,704 --> 00:04:56,230
Oh I'm sorry.
I realize you're a person.

59
00:04:56,334 --> 00:04:57,790
I try to be.

60
00:04:57,894 --> 00:04:59,301
Pierre Peders.

61
00:04:59,405 --> 00:05:01,239
I'm sorry. Peter Peders?

62
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:02,952
Pierre Peders.

63
00:05:03,056 --> 00:05:04,435
Ah, I see. I see.

64
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:06,376
Enchanté.

65
00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:08,987
Hey, I was just wondering...

66
00:05:09,091 --> 00:05:11,176
I'm sorry. One second.

67
00:05:14,528 --> 00:05:16,350
Yeah. No, I just got here.

68
00:05:16,454 --> 00:05:18,540
Yeah.

69
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:22,113
Okay. I'm gonna
have to call you back.

70
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:25,366
Before I forget.
What time is that thing on Sunday?

71
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,093
All right. I'll talk to you later.

72
00:05:27,197 --> 00:05:28,388
Okay. Bye.

73
00:05:28,492 --> 00:05:34,528
I was just wondering if there was any
way we could have my usual table.

74
00:05:34,633 --> 00:05:38,293
I'm so sorry. It must have
been a mix-up. It's already taken.

75
00:05:38,397 --> 00:05:41,404
I just...I feel a little exposed here.

76
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:42,987
Let me see what I can do.

77
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:46,281
Thank you so much, Donald.
Thank you.

78
00:05:49,314 --> 00:05:51,884
I'm sorry I'm a little late.

79
00:05:52,809 --> 00:05:54,943
No, don't be silly.

80
00:05:55,077 --> 00:05:56,322
Traffic?

81
00:05:56,426 --> 00:05:57,478
Ha? No.

82
00:05:57,582 --> 00:06:01,392
No. My loft is just a couple
of blocks away.

83
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:06,762
Thank you very much.

84
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,173
I really appreciate it.

85
00:06:08,277 --> 00:06:10,936
Please. We're crazy about you.

86
00:06:10,993 --> 00:06:12,673
Glad to see you in one piece.

87
00:06:12,777 --> 00:06:14,479
I heal rather nicely, don't I?

88
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,756
Oh, my God. That last one...

89
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,034
So intense.

90
00:06:18,138 --> 00:06:19,715
He dragged me twice. Sadist.

91
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:21,839
Jerrie's right. You loved it.

92
00:06:21,943 --> 00:06:23,479
And you're in the new one, right?

93
00:06:23,584 --> 00:06:24,600
As a ghost?

94
00:06:24,705 --> 00:06:27,159
I can't say.
You're just gonna have to go see it.

95
00:06:27,264 --> 00:06:28,965
Come on.
- I can't.

96
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:30,219
We'll go see it.

97
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,894
Have a nice dinner.
Take care.

98
00:06:33,537 --> 00:06:35,842
Thank you so much, Dennis.

99
00:06:35,877 --> 00:06:36,858
Donald.

100
00:06:36,962 --> 00:06:37,870
Donald!

101
00:06:37,975 --> 00:06:40,060
Donald, sorry.

102
00:06:47,547 --> 00:06:49,632
Well.

103
00:06:49,773 --> 00:06:52,353
They certainly loved
your slasher movie.

104
00:06:52,457 --> 00:06:55,647
The horror film? Yeah. They seem to.

105
00:06:57,633 --> 00:06:59,717
Were you...?

106
00:07:00,443 --> 00:07:02,322
Were you in the first one?

107
00:07:02,427 --> 00:07:04,104
In the original?

108
00:07:04,209 --> 00:07:04,925
No.

109
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:06,959
I wasn't born.

110
00:07:07,063 --> 00:07:09,040
That was a long time ago.

111
00:07:09,144 --> 00:07:11,892
But you came into it in...When?

112
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:14,653
Isn't it 'Body'?
It's 'Body', it's 'Killer'...

113
00:07:14,757 --> 00:07:17,217
Killer Body - Part 4.

114
00:07:17,321 --> 00:07:19,244
And you play a ghost?
Or something?

115
00:07:19,348 --> 00:07:20,573
No.

116
00:07:20,677 --> 00:07:21,690
No. Not exactly.

117
00:07:21,794 --> 00:07:24,686
Did they not send you a screener?
Normally you get sent screeners before.

118
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:25,884
Yeah. I know it's...

119
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:27,192
It's in my bag.

120
00:07:27,297 --> 00:07:28,463
Hello.

121
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:29,068
Hi.

122
00:07:29,173 --> 00:07:31,328
What can I get you to drink?

123
00:07:31,433 --> 00:07:35,437
I think I will have a
raspberry Martini, please.

124
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:36,936
Thanks.

125
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,124
Miss!

126
00:07:39,522 --> 00:07:41,476
I'm sorry.
Another Scotch?

127
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,524
It's Maker's Mark.

128
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,574
Sure.
And I'll be back with menus.

129
00:07:44,678 --> 00:07:45,977
I'm not eating. We're not...

130
00:07:46,081 --> 00:07:48,145
I mean unless you're hungry.

131
00:07:48,249 --> 00:07:49,148
No.

132
00:07:49,252 --> 00:07:51,030
Okay.

133
00:07:51,135 --> 00:07:52,400
So.

134
00:07:52,504 --> 00:07:54,589
Mr. Pierre Pierre.

135
00:08:01,221 --> 00:08:02,729
What's that for?

136
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:05,781
My tape recorder had a stroke.

137
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:09,300
It occurred to me that
I could record sound with this.

138
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:10,338
Ah, sure. Yes.

139
00:08:10,442 --> 00:08:14,785
I won't take the cap off. Okay?
- No, that's fine.

140
00:08:17,326 --> 00:08:18,819
Katya.

141
00:08:18,924 --> 00:08:21,008
The one and only.

142
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:23,113
What kind of a name is it?

143
00:08:23,217 --> 00:08:25,111
It's a Russian name.

144
00:08:25,214 --> 00:08:26,209
Kat-ya.

145
00:08:26,313 --> 00:08:28,135
Are your parents Russian?

146
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:30,241
No, my mother is Dutch.
And my father is...

147
00:08:30,346 --> 00:08:32,431
What city is she from?

148
00:08:32,662 --> 00:08:34,183
Amsterdam.

149
00:08:34,287 --> 00:08:36,133
Amsterdam - Sin City.

150
00:08:36,238 --> 00:08:38,021
I've never been.

151
00:08:38,124 --> 00:08:40,930
You should go.
I've been many times.

152
00:08:41,035 --> 00:08:43,119
Legal prostitution.

153
00:08:44,573 --> 00:08:46,984
And your father? I'm sorry.

154
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,901
Do you know anything
about me at all?

155
00:08:53,005 --> 00:08:54,152
It's all right...

156
00:08:54,256 --> 00:08:56,649
I mean they sent me a brief, but...

157
00:08:56,753 --> 00:08:58,607
You didn't read it?

158
00:08:58,711 --> 00:09:01,169
I mean it's fine.
You just don't seem to really...

159
00:09:01,274 --> 00:09:03,081
No, I'd rather...

160
00:09:03,185 --> 00:09:04,208
Get to know.

161
00:09:04,312 --> 00:09:05,416
Yeah.
- Right.

162
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,685
And I'm sorry I have
not seen any of your films.

163
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:15,928
I know you.

164
00:09:16,033 --> 00:09:20,286
I guess I know you more
by your reputation.

165
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,599
You mean by who I'm fucking.

166
00:09:22,704 --> 00:09:24,159
Here you go.

167
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:26,348
Thank you.

168
00:09:27,487 --> 00:09:28,910
Thank you.

169
00:09:29,015 --> 00:09:31,099
Enjoy.

170
00:09:35,691 --> 00:09:37,227
Okay. I'm...

171
00:09:37,331 --> 00:09:38,978
You're gonna have to forgive me.
I don't...

172
00:09:39,082 --> 00:09:41,750
I don't usually do this.

173
00:09:41,854 --> 00:09:44,926
You don't normally do interviews?

174
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,466
Not with actresses.

175
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:48,011
Okay.

176
00:09:48,115 --> 00:09:51,128
I usually handle politics.

177
00:09:51,411 --> 00:09:52,401
Washington.

178
00:09:52,505 --> 00:09:54,591
International.

179
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,302
So that's your excuse for
being unprepared.

180
00:09:58,407 --> 00:10:01,839
Because I'm not a member of
the Senate or a general?

181
00:10:01,944 --> 00:10:06,917
Did they mention to you that I actually
happen to be Secretary for Sex Education?

182
00:10:08,413 --> 00:10:10,974
You know if you fuck the right
people in this administration...

183
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:17,281
You can be the
head of FEMA in no time.

184
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,532
Okay. Look, I'm...

185
00:10:19,636 --> 00:10:22,042
I'm really tired.
Anyway, we really...

186
00:10:22,146 --> 00:10:23,098
Let's not do this now.

187
00:10:23,203 --> 00:10:25,506
No. I'm sorry. Let's...

188
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:28,354
I'm sorry.

189
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:31,742
Could you sign something for me?

190
00:10:31,847 --> 00:10:32,956
Like my iPod?

191
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,145
Of course. Sure.

192
00:10:35,198 --> 00:10:36,311
What's your name?

193
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,241
Theodor.

194
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,430
Theo is fine.

195
00:10:39,724 --> 00:10:41,810
To Theo.

196
00:10:42,021 --> 00:10:43,628
Love.

197
00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:45,818
Katya.

198
00:10:46,115 --> 00:10:48,200
There you go.

199
00:10:49,153 --> 00:10:50,065
Thanks.

200
00:10:50,169 --> 00:10:51,817
Sorry.

201
00:10:51,921 --> 00:10:54,755
Well, you must get that a lot, huh?

202
00:10:54,860 --> 00:11:00,087
You wouldn't believe half the stuff
I've been asked to sign.

203
00:11:02,049 --> 00:11:04,494
Bicycles, cars, shoes.

204
00:11:04,598 --> 00:11:06,414
Breasts.

205
00:11:06,518 --> 00:11:08,603
Forehead once.

206
00:11:09,748 --> 00:11:13,153
You really don't care at all, do you?

207
00:11:13,665 --> 00:11:18,645
I'm sorry. It's just a little odd for
a journalist to be so uncurious.

208
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,409
I'm sorry I have to say it, you know.

209
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,948
No. No. I apologize.
Am I being unprofessional?

210
00:11:23,052 --> 00:11:25,530
Oh, I think so, don't you?
Just a little?

211
00:11:25,633 --> 00:11:28,387
Do you know how long
I've waited here for you?

212
00:11:28,492 --> 00:11:30,576
No, I do not.

213
00:11:33,099 --> 00:11:34,793
Over an hour.

214
00:11:34,898 --> 00:11:36,498
And yes. Somebody should have called.

215
00:11:36,603 --> 00:11:39,885
Maybe you don't know this
but there's a shitstorm brewing
in Washington.

216
00:11:39,886 --> 00:11:42,538
And my editor wanted to
send me to Washington tonight.

217
00:11:42,539 --> 00:11:45,950
So I can be there for the
press conference tomorrow.

218
00:11:46,151 --> 00:11:47,384
But...

219
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:49,574
Here I am. For you.

220
00:11:52,013 --> 00:11:53,579
So.

221
00:11:53,683 --> 00:11:55,230
How are we doing?

222
00:11:55,335 --> 00:11:57,679
I think we'll just
get the check please.

223
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:59,407
Of course.
- Thank you.

224
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:00,846
Great. Thanks.

225
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,558
You know if you're this
big-time political pundit...

226
00:12:03,663 --> 00:12:06,425
Then why would they send you
to interview me?

227
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:11,209
Look, I don't know any more
than you do why they sent me.

228
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:14,118
Maybe they thought it was important.

229
00:12:14,222 --> 00:12:18,564
So like I said, here I am. All right?
Why don't we make the best of it?

230
00:12:18,668 --> 00:12:20,063
Okay, but...

231
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:23,446
If this is your best then...

232
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:27,469
It's not a joke.

233
00:12:27,574 --> 00:12:29,541
Oh, and I am?

234
00:12:29,646 --> 00:12:30,420
Here you are.

235
00:12:30,525 --> 00:12:31,937
Thank you.

236
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:32,747
I'll get it.

237
00:12:32,851 --> 00:12:34,016
No, it's fine. I'll get it.

238
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,157
I have an expense account.

239
00:12:35,261 --> 00:12:37,566
I have a bank account.

240
00:12:38,988 --> 00:12:40,706
Please...
It's my pleasure.

241
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,896
You know what?

242
00:12:44,438 --> 00:12:48,482
It's been very nice wasting
time with you, Peter Peders.

243
00:12:48,586 --> 00:12:51,157
You too, Cunt-ya.

244
00:12:53,693 --> 00:12:55,779
And go fuck yourself.

245
00:13:12,712 --> 00:13:14,797
Thank you. Good-bye.

246
00:13:23,951 --> 00:13:26,698
Can it just be pretty quick?

247
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:44,709
All right. Have a nice night!

248
00:13:55,647 --> 00:13:57,732
I know who you are.

249
00:13:58,286 --> 00:14:00,413
You are beautiful, baby.

250
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:02,701
Come on.
Don't be that way.

251
00:14:02,805 --> 00:14:06,127
I just wanna see that smile.
That killer smile.

252
00:14:06,232 --> 00:14:10,131
I love you. Yeah.
You're my girl right there.

253
00:14:11,406 --> 00:14:14,787
Come on, give me the whole thing.
Give me the whole thing.

254
00:14:14,891 --> 00:14:16,977
There goes Katya.

255
00:14:18,001 --> 00:14:19,448
Can you just drive, please?

256
00:14:19,553 --> 00:14:20,645
You don't know who that is?

257
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,834
Watch it.

258
00:14:27,088 --> 00:14:29,570
What the hell
is the matter with you?

259
00:14:29,789 --> 00:14:31,163
Pierre?

260
00:14:31,268 --> 00:14:33,353
Are you all right?

261
00:14:35,017 --> 00:14:36,106
Let me see.

262
00:14:36,211 --> 00:14:39,489
Yeah. No.
It's just a bump. I'm fine.

263
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,484
Pierre your bag!

264
00:14:42,621 --> 00:14:44,870
You've left your bag, Pierre!

265
00:14:44,974 --> 00:14:47,279
Let me have a look at you.

266
00:14:48,041 --> 00:14:50,127
Oh, God.
It's bleeding. Wait.

267
00:15:07,412 --> 00:15:09,618
It really wasn't necessary, you know.

268
00:15:09,723 --> 00:15:10,671
Shut up.

269
00:15:10,775 --> 00:15:12,860
You bumped your head.

270
00:15:21,133 --> 00:15:23,242
Do you have a union card?

271
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,165
Come on.

272
00:15:51,681 --> 00:15:53,502
Hallo.

273
00:15:53,607 --> 00:15:54,901
Hi, honey.

274
00:15:55,005 --> 00:15:55,996
You're at home?

275
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,995
No. No. We're still at the restaurant.

276
00:15:59,099 --> 00:16:01,669
Yeah, I know. But I was late.

277
00:16:03,037 --> 00:16:05,899
'Cause it's pretty quiet here right now.

278
00:16:06,004 --> 00:16:10,523
Yeah. Listen, I'm gonna
have to call you back. Okay?

279
00:16:11,283 --> 00:16:13,091
Yeah. Newsworld.

280
00:16:13,195 --> 00:16:15,942
Sweetie, for the film.
Remember?

281
00:16:16,411 --> 00:16:19,412
Okay, sweetie. I'll call you back.
Just watch the game or something.

282
00:16:19,516 --> 00:16:21,286
Bye.

283
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,475
Now let me see.

284
00:16:24,715 --> 00:16:27,373
I can't see. Get in the light.

285
00:16:30,383 --> 00:16:31,761
Here.

286
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,951
On your head.

287
00:16:34,762 --> 00:16:36,847
Yes, doctor.

288
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,960
You know I could really use a drink.

289
00:16:55,236 --> 00:16:57,321
A drink. Yeah.

290
00:16:57,718 --> 00:17:03,106
Do you think that's a good idea?
I mean you probably have concussion.

291
00:17:03,211 --> 00:17:06,088
I do not have a concussion.
Believe me.

292
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,737
I don't have any Bourbon.
Is Scotch okay?

293
00:17:10,372 --> 00:17:12,894
That would be much appreciated.

294
00:17:15,194 --> 00:17:16,302
Me...

295
00:17:16,406 --> 00:17:17,428
Please.

296
00:17:21,952 --> 00:17:23,727
So some place you've got here.

297
00:17:23,831 --> 00:17:25,917
The luxury of success.

298
00:17:28,253 --> 00:17:32,929
Well, when you move out
they can always make it an airport.

299
00:17:33,033 --> 00:17:33,838
Cheers.

300
00:17:33,942 --> 00:17:36,027
Salute!

301
00:17:38,283 --> 00:17:40,018
Listen, I...

302
00:17:40,122 --> 00:17:41,587
I apologize...

303
00:17:41,692 --> 00:17:43,995
For being unprofessional.

304
00:17:45,059 --> 00:17:47,186
Apology accepted.

305
00:17:47,585 --> 00:17:49,279
How is your head?

306
00:17:51,568 --> 00:17:53,653
Couple of more minutes.

307
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:02,849
Are you gonna sit down
and have a drink with me?

308
00:18:03,234 --> 00:18:05,586
Come on.
You're making me nervous.

309
00:18:06,281 --> 00:18:07,854
This is very good Scotch.

310
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:10,131
Lucky for you.

311
00:18:14,502 --> 00:18:17,229
It was very kind of you
to bring me here.

312
00:18:18,596 --> 00:18:21,013
It's closer than
the emergency room.

313
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,641
Besides, I must feel responsible.

314
00:18:24,004 --> 00:18:26,892
Well, you should.
This is all your fault.

315
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,074
See that?

316
00:18:28,178 --> 00:18:30,690
That killer smile causes car wrecks.

317
00:18:30,794 --> 00:18:33,512
God, you're better
when you're drunk.

318
00:18:33,617 --> 00:18:36,137
I have a long way to go
before that happens.

319
00:18:36,242 --> 00:18:38,989
I better get you another.

320
00:18:40,298 --> 00:18:42,843
Why don't you just
bring the bottle?

321
00:18:42,947 --> 00:18:45,031
Yes, Captain.

322
00:18:46,571 --> 00:18:49,205
Look, you're more than welcome
to stay and finish up your drink.

323
00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:52,950
But I really have to work
on my lines soon. Okay?

324
00:18:53,851 --> 00:18:54,926
For what?

325
00:18:57,448 --> 00:18:58,870
You're kidding, right?

326
00:18:58,974 --> 00:19:00,944
I'm sorry.
My brain must be frozen.

327
00:19:01,048 --> 00:19:01,891
For my show.

328
00:19:01,995 --> 00:19:03,911
I do a TV show.

329
00:19:04,015 --> 00:19:07,189
I know. I know that.
I knew that. Hum..

330
00:19:07,294 --> 00:19:08,030
I do.

331
00:19:08,134 --> 00:19:09,529
City something.

332
00:19:09,634 --> 00:19:10,749
Sexy City.

333
00:19:10,854 --> 00:19:11,728
City Girls.

334
00:19:11,832 --> 00:19:12,549
Sexy City Girls.

335
00:19:12,654 --> 00:19:15,520
Not sexy.
No, just City Girls.

336
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,710
But you're also sexy.

337
00:19:18,614 --> 00:19:22,554
Don't even pretend you watch
the show, Pierre. Okay?

338
00:19:26,342 --> 00:19:28,426
You're beautiful.

339
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,991
That's why I play the lead.

340
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:35,024
I'm sorry.

341
00:19:35,264 --> 00:19:37,352
It is...

342
00:19:37,628 --> 00:19:40,081
Really important for your career?

343
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,055
Is journalism important
for your personality?

344
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:46,193
Yeah, I think so.

345
00:19:46,297 --> 00:19:47,704
How?

346
00:19:47,808 --> 00:19:50,488
Well, it's made me
a better person.

347
00:19:50,592 --> 00:19:53,782
What kind of person
were you before?

348
00:19:55,192 --> 00:19:58,116
So what are you gonna do next?

349
00:19:58,809 --> 00:20:00,894
Basic Instinct 3?

350
00:20:02,288 --> 00:20:05,559
You're not interviewing
me now, okay?

351
00:20:06,136 --> 00:20:07,745
Well, I gotta write something.

352
00:20:07,849 --> 00:20:09,092
Well, make it up.

353
00:20:09,196 --> 00:20:11,281
Everybody else does.

354
00:20:13,532 --> 00:20:15,333
What?

355
00:20:15,438 --> 00:20:17,523
Oh, Maggie.
Stop.

356
00:20:18,907 --> 00:20:20,412
What?

357
00:20:20,516 --> 00:20:21,110
No.

358
00:20:21,214 --> 00:20:23,298
Are you crazy?

359
00:20:24,106 --> 00:20:24,907
No.

360
00:20:25,012 --> 00:20:26,495
It's crazy.

361
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:28,991
I'm gonna be a while, okay?

362
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:36,242
There's a computer over there.

363
00:20:36,346 --> 00:20:38,005
You can google me.

364
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,194
Oh nobody.

365
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:42,722
Sweetie, because of
everything that's going on.

366
00:20:42,744 --> 00:20:45,651
I just really don't think
it's a good idea.

367
00:20:50,769 --> 00:20:55,289
You know. We have to
be really careful. That's all.

368
00:20:55,436 --> 00:20:59,179
Because this has happened before
and it's gonna happen again.

369
00:20:59,283 --> 00:21:02,116
...considered to be the
architect of the president's success,

370
00:21:02,221 --> 00:21:05,769
...has been implicated, along with
several other senior advisers.

371
00:21:05,873 --> 00:21:08,542
The president wasn't answering
any questions today.

372
00:21:08,646 --> 00:21:11,344
The vice-president was also
unavailable for comment.

373
00:21:11,449 --> 00:21:12,382
No shit.

374
00:21:12,486 --> 00:21:15,998
The White House decided to hold
a press conference early tomorrow
to address the charges.

375
00:21:16,062 --> 00:21:18,334
Further indictments are anticipated.

376
00:21:18,439 --> 00:21:23,599
Although 'who and when' is a major topic
of speculation inside the Beltway.

377
00:21:23,704 --> 00:21:27,994
Our guest tonight has won two national
News Emmy Awards for his TV work.

378
00:21:28,098 --> 00:21:30,935
With the ABC news show 20:20.

379
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,233
Danny Schechter - great.

380
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:38,088
Listen, it's after nine.
You don't watch?

381
00:21:39,784 --> 00:21:42,358
Can you turn to Fox, please?

382
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,654
<i>What is your take on
what's going on in Washington?</i>

383
00:21:44,758 --> 00:21:48,614
Well, what happens in scandals like
this is not just the first reports.

384
00:21:48,721 --> 00:21:51,821
But whether or not there'll be
follow-up and persistent digging.

385
00:21:51,911 --> 00:21:53,599
Can I have my remote, please?

386
00:21:53,704 --> 00:21:55,927
Please, I just need to see this.

387
00:21:56,033 --> 00:21:58,219
We find that a lot of journalists
become more competitive.

388
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:01,486
When there's a big story breaking.
And I think they'll go after this one.

389
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:04,127
But with an indictment
of this size...

390
00:22:04,191 --> 00:22:07,371
We're likely to see
a feeding frenzy in Washington.

391
00:22:07,475 --> 00:22:10,637
Which could escalate
this into a much bigger crisis.

392
00:22:10,741 --> 00:22:14,489
I think we're gonna see the
blogosphere taking the lead here, but...

393
00:22:14,592 --> 00:22:17,356
Are you still angry with me?
Is that it?

394
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,546
I'm not angry with you.

395
00:22:20,136 --> 00:22:22,441
Then are we still friends?

396
00:22:22,568 --> 00:22:24,175
Of course we're still friends.

397
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:25,455
Why wouldn't we be?

398
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,770
But friends return phone calls.

399
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:29,378
Friends tell each other their problems.

400
00:22:29,483 --> 00:22:30,849
Hey, Larry. It's me.

401
00:22:30,953 --> 00:22:32,531
Are you watching that event now?

402
00:22:32,635 --> 00:22:33,965
No, I'm not.

403
00:22:34,069 --> 00:22:35,934
Well, I tell you who's not on it.

404
00:22:36,037 --> 00:22:36,813
Me.

405
00:22:36,917 --> 00:22:38,013
They never let you anyway.

406
00:22:38,117 --> 00:22:40,203
Ha-hah. Very funny.

407
00:22:41,017 --> 00:22:43,555
Because I'm not in DC.
That's why!

408
00:22:43,659 --> 00:22:45,018
<i>Just leave me alone, please.</i>

409
00:22:45,122 --> 00:22:46,830
<i>Not until you tell me
what's going on.</i>

410
00:22:46,934 --> 00:22:49,312
<i>There's nothing going on.
Don't you get it?</i>

411
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:51,502
<i>Amy.</i>

412
00:22:51,564 --> 00:22:53,877
<i>Look, I just wanna be left alone.</i>

413
00:22:53,982 --> 00:22:55,973
I'm not sending you down there
to hang out just with anybody.

414
00:22:56,078 --> 00:22:57,784
Okay. Look, fine.

415
00:22:57,888 --> 00:22:58,841
I'll pay for it.

416
00:22:58,946 --> 00:23:01,420
I will get there on my own.
All right?

417
00:23:01,524 --> 00:23:04,112
I'll write a story and if you don't like it,
you don't have to use it.

418
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,778
What about the other piece?

419
00:23:05,882 --> 00:23:06,757
What other piece?

420
00:23:06,862 --> 00:23:10,230
The one I'm paying you for.

421
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:13,212
Yeah. No, it went fine.

422
00:23:13,317 --> 00:23:15,752
We talked about her tits,
we talked about her movies.

423
00:23:15,856 --> 00:23:16,986
It's very moving.

424
00:23:17,091 --> 00:23:19,175
Talk to me.

425
00:23:21,788 --> 00:23:23,229
You know what Larry?
Just forget it.

426
00:23:23,332 --> 00:23:25,417
No, fuck it.

427
00:23:25,797 --> 00:23:27,923
Pierre, maybe next time.

428
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,408
Fuck you.

429
00:23:32,389 --> 00:23:34,474
That was stupid.

430
00:23:34,757 --> 00:23:38,849
You know there're more journalists dead
in Iraq than in all of Vietnam War.

431
00:23:38,953 --> 00:23:40,102
Fuck you.

432
00:23:42,114 --> 00:23:45,570
I want you to be happy.
That's all.

433
00:23:48,084 --> 00:23:49,783
Amy.

434
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:52,635
I need you in my life, baby.

435
00:24:01,455 --> 00:24:04,468
You know you
can tell me anything.

436
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:06,979
I love you.

437
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:09,169
But I miss you.

438
00:24:09,723 --> 00:24:10,869
I miss you, too, Amy.

439
00:24:10,973 --> 00:24:13,059
Hey, that's you.

440
00:24:13,147 --> 00:24:13,978
No.

441
00:24:14,083 --> 00:24:16,167
Don't look at me.

442
00:24:16,412 --> 00:24:18,498
I'm a mess.

443
00:24:20,193 --> 00:24:22,409
I think you're beautiful.

444
00:24:24,187 --> 00:24:26,008
Who writes this shit?

445
00:24:26,113 --> 00:24:28,197
Sophia?

446
00:24:30,103 --> 00:24:32,187
Hi, sweetheart.

447
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:36,326
I didn't expect to see you here.

448
00:24:36,347 --> 00:24:38,433
I'm good at crying.

449
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,597
You know sometimes...

450
00:24:43,013 --> 00:24:45,494
They want the muffled weep.

451
00:24:53,375 --> 00:24:55,945
Then sometimes the sob.

452
00:25:08,439 --> 00:25:10,417
I'm impressed.
That's a good acting.

453
00:25:10,521 --> 00:25:13,630
I don't know if it's acting.
It's more like a trick, you know?

454
00:25:13,734 --> 00:25:15,975
What other tricks do you know?

455
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:18,916
I can do this with my tongue.

456
00:25:20,678 --> 00:25:22,351
It's genetic, really. But still...

457
00:25:22,455 --> 00:25:23,962
Now I see why you're star.

458
00:25:24,066 --> 00:25:26,152
At last.

459
00:25:29,238 --> 00:25:31,103
All right. So, were you...

460
00:25:31,208 --> 00:25:33,954
Always interested in acting?

461
00:25:38,175 --> 00:25:40,260
God. Yah.

462
00:25:40,411 --> 00:25:42,496
Pierre. Pierre.

463
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:46,808
If I were a politician, would you ask
me such uninteresting questions?

464
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:49,040
Am I that boring to you?

465
00:25:49,063 --> 00:25:54,734
Why do you choose only the most
commercial crap that's out there?

466
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:03,145
Do you enjoy appearing in B movies?

467
00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:05,344
And horror films?

468
00:26:05,942 --> 00:26:07,628
Do you think you're
any good in them?

469
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,818
I like my movies.

470
00:26:10,393 --> 00:26:13,387
You know I may not be a great
actress, but I will be one day.

471
00:26:13,491 --> 00:26:17,271
And yes, I enjoy entertaining
millions upon millions of people.

472
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:18,875
How large is your readership?

473
00:26:18,979 --> 00:26:21,992
You know I have dozens of readers.

474
00:26:22,846 --> 00:26:28,817
And I doubt that any of them were
entertained by your performance in...

475
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,007
What was it?

476
00:26:31,099 --> 00:26:33,183
'Life of the Party'

477
00:26:34,366 --> 00:26:36,273
Now that was scary.

478
00:26:36,378 --> 00:26:37,808
It was supposed
to be a comedy, right?

479
00:26:37,913 --> 00:26:39,998
Why would you lie?

480
00:26:44,281 --> 00:26:45,413
About what?

481
00:26:45,517 --> 00:26:48,119
You said you'd never seen one of
my movies. Why would you lie?

482
00:26:48,223 --> 00:26:51,679
I forgot that one.
I saw it on a flight.

483
00:26:51,834 --> 00:26:53,919
Not very memorable.

484
00:26:53,992 --> 00:26:56,973
I watched most of it
with the sound off.

485
00:26:57,078 --> 00:27:00,172
And still I was wishing
the plane would go down.

486
00:27:08,232 --> 00:27:09,368
I mean...

487
00:27:09,472 --> 00:27:12,136
Do you wanna be taken
seriously as an actress?

488
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,846
Is that why you had
your breast reduced?

489
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,733
You miss my tits.
Is that is?

490
00:27:16,837 --> 00:27:18,356
Well, don't you?

491
00:27:18,461 --> 00:27:21,109
They weren't even
mine to begin with.

492
00:27:21,214 --> 00:27:24,204
I made them bigger
for the Killer Body movies.

493
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,724
So you did it for your art.

494
00:27:25,828 --> 00:27:29,525
I'm so sick of talking about this.
I can't even begin to tell you.

495
00:27:29,629 --> 00:27:30,878
Did they pay you by the inch?

496
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:34,649
It's not different to me to putting
on a costume or wearing a wig.

497
00:27:34,754 --> 00:27:36,198
Or fishnet stockings.

498
00:27:36,302 --> 00:27:37,314
Really?

499
00:27:37,418 --> 00:27:40,582
Do you like fishnet stockings, Pierre?

500
00:27:40,686 --> 00:27:41,604
Wait. Let me rephrase.

501
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:47,771
Why do you think it is that men like
fishnet stockings so much?

502
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,009
They look good on women.

503
00:27:49,113 --> 00:27:50,931
Fishnet stockings ...

504
00:27:51,035 --> 00:27:53,121
... are a net.

505
00:27:53,222 --> 00:27:56,453
And the woman is
imprisoned within this net.

506
00:27:56,557 --> 00:27:58,641
Like a fish.

507
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:01,089
You get it?

508
00:28:01,193 --> 00:28:02,675
Ah...Yeah.

509
00:28:02,779 --> 00:28:05,426
And what about high heels?

510
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:06,440
Well.

511
00:28:06,544 --> 00:28:10,005
High heels make
walking very difficult.

512
00:28:10,109 --> 00:28:12,579
So you see nothing would be
more attractive to a man ...

513
00:28:12,643 --> 00:28:16,120
Than a woman wearing fishnet stockings
and high heels, because...

514
00:28:16,224 --> 00:28:18,283
She has trouble walking.

515
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:20,528
And she's imprisoned
within this net.

516
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:24,886
And therefore he thinks
she's easy prey.

517
00:28:25,986 --> 00:28:28,072
I know everything.

518
00:28:28,312 --> 00:28:29,919
Oh yeah?

519
00:28:30,023 --> 00:28:32,366
What makes a man attractive?

520
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,555
Are you hungry?

521
00:28:41,037 --> 00:28:43,518
What makes a man attractive?

522
00:28:43,748 --> 00:28:47,058
If you'd rather have a sandwich,
I think I have some baloney.

523
00:28:47,163 --> 00:28:50,175
That's been working for us so far.

524
00:28:50,659 --> 00:28:52,875
Is Pierre your real name?

525
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:59,421
Or is that something you invented
to sound more international?

526
00:28:59,525 --> 00:29:01,443
And why aren't you in
Washington already?

527
00:29:01,547 --> 00:29:03,849
Because as far as I can tell
the shit's been brewing for days.

528
00:29:03,953 --> 00:29:05,392
It's been on the news non-stop.

529
00:29:05,497 --> 00:29:08,579
Why don't you answer my question?

530
00:29:08,683 --> 00:29:11,519
What makes a man attractive?

531
00:29:15,874 --> 00:29:17,959
A scar.

532
00:29:19,494 --> 00:29:20,876
Why?

533
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:23,066
Because...

534
00:29:23,435 --> 00:29:25,650
Most women have one, too.

535
00:29:30,681 --> 00:29:32,766
And where...

536
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:35,370
You are beautiful.

537
00:29:35,475 --> 00:29:37,867
You are repeating yourself.

538
00:29:38,797 --> 00:29:40,883
Don't step on my boots.

539
00:29:47,227 --> 00:29:48,360
So tell me...

540
00:29:48,464 --> 00:29:51,122
Are you good at seducing men?

541
00:29:52,562 --> 00:29:54,647
Are you gay, Pierre?

542
00:29:56,058 --> 00:29:57,737
Well, maybe.

543
00:29:57,841 --> 00:30:01,110
Many years ago in El Salvador
I let a guy in high heels...

544
00:30:01,111 --> 00:30:04,275
... and too much
lipstick jerk me off.

545
00:30:04,488 --> 00:30:06,970
And I paid him 20 bucks.

546
00:30:07,164 --> 00:30:09,829
But hey...
He was wearing fishnets.

547
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:12,115
So how could I resist?

548
00:30:12,219 --> 00:30:15,397
Are you sure he
only jerked you off?

549
00:30:15,501 --> 00:30:16,709
Well.

550
00:30:16,813 --> 00:30:19,472
That night I was pretty drunk.

551
00:30:19,535 --> 00:30:20,917
So...

552
00:30:21,022 --> 00:30:23,947
Maybe he did take
advantage of me.

553
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:28,593
The funny thing is...

554
00:30:28,697 --> 00:30:32,348
I convinced myself that
I really wasn't cheating on my wife.

555
00:30:32,452 --> 00:30:33,309
Like...

556
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,355
Like that didn't count.

557
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,937
Kids?

558
00:30:43,532 --> 00:30:44,113
No.

559
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:47,447
So back to my question.
And your answer.

560
00:30:47,551 --> 00:30:50,370
Are you good at seducing men?

561
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:54,024
Do you realize how many
men would kill ...

562
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:58,394
To be standing
as close as you are now?

563
00:30:58,499 --> 00:31:00,583
How many?

564
00:31:01,876 --> 00:31:03,087
Most.

565
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,867
Even the gay ones?

566
00:31:04,971 --> 00:31:07,807
I'm not gonna seduce you, Peter.

567
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:09,922
Well, I don't want you to, Kathy.

568
00:31:10,026 --> 00:31:12,111
Really?

569
00:31:13,182 --> 00:31:15,391
You said I was beautiful.

570
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:16,545
Twice.

571
00:31:16,649 --> 00:31:18,735
So?

572
00:31:18,874 --> 00:31:21,688
What would be the point
in telling me that I was beautiful....

573
00:31:21,792 --> 00:31:24,451
If you didn't wanna fuck me?

574
00:31:25,579 --> 00:31:26,584
No, I don't.

575
00:31:26,688 --> 00:31:28,774
Wanna fuck me?

576
00:31:30,635 --> 00:31:31,740
You know what?

577
00:31:31,844 --> 00:31:33,670
I don't fuck celebrities.

578
00:31:33,774 --> 00:31:36,611
I don't fuck nobodies.

579
00:31:38,581 --> 00:31:40,886
Would you kiss me, Pierre?

580
00:31:41,663 --> 00:31:43,748
A French kiss?

581
00:31:44,431 --> 00:31:46,557
What would be the point?

582
00:31:49,223 --> 00:31:51,308
It's okay.

583
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:55,869
No, it's not okay.
Because I don't want to.

584
00:31:55,974 --> 00:31:58,059
Why not?

585
00:31:58,403 --> 00:32:01,226
Well, believe it or not.
You're not my type.

586
00:32:01,331 --> 00:32:03,415
And you...

587
00:32:03,696 --> 00:32:05,781
Are so not my type.

588
00:32:08,261 --> 00:32:10,347
Kiss me.

589
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:35,220
God, I hate you.

590
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:38,286
What?

591
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:43,974
I said, I hate you.
What the fuck did you think I said?

592
00:32:46,198 --> 00:32:48,282
Hi, sweetie.

593
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,156
Yeah, I'm back home.

594
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:52,032
'How was it?'

595
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:55,260
Ah, the interview was all right.
A little boring, though.

596
00:32:55,364 --> 00:32:58,265
Weird guy.
Peter... something.

597
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:01,687
Yeah. He looks just like my dad.

598
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:16,654
Where are you going?

599
00:33:17,672 --> 00:33:22,103
Baby, I just started bleeding.
Can I call you back?

600
00:33:22,344 --> 00:33:24,430
I love you, too. Bye.

601
00:33:25,501 --> 00:33:27,586
What are you doing?

602
00:33:30,190 --> 00:33:32,276
What am I doing?

603
00:33:32,384 --> 00:33:33,510
What are you doing?

604
00:33:33,614 --> 00:33:35,699
We're having fun.

605
00:33:36,205 --> 00:33:39,650
Yeah. I was having fun.
Now I'm gonna have to go find my friend.

606
00:33:39,754 --> 00:33:41,915
With the high heels and the lipstick.

607
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:44,863
Because at least
he finishes what he starts.

608
00:33:44,967 --> 00:33:46,670
You've given up the interview?

609
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:47,794
What interview?

610
00:33:47,898 --> 00:33:49,984
The one you started?

611
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:54,889
You can ask me anything.

612
00:33:54,993 --> 00:33:57,078
Anything at all.

613
00:33:58,546 --> 00:34:00,630
Really?

614
00:34:07,931 --> 00:34:10,017
Why did you kiss me?

615
00:34:10,884 --> 00:34:14,340
Why do men always want
to talk about it?

616
00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:17,198
Was that your boyfriend
on the phone?

617
00:34:17,303 --> 00:34:21,911
Well, that certainly wasn't my girlfriend.
That's for sure.

618
00:34:30,513 --> 00:34:33,006
What the hell is wrong with you?

619
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:35,679
You're on drugs or something?

620
00:34:35,977 --> 00:34:41,070
You have to feel sorry for me.
I mean I probably have silicon for brains.

621
00:34:41,174 --> 00:34:46,285
You know that bastard of a surgeon
must have transferred some
in there from my tits.

622
00:34:47,632 --> 00:34:50,999
If you don't wanna take
me seriously...

623
00:34:51,625 --> 00:34:53,407
You are fucking nuts, all right?

624
00:34:53,512 --> 00:34:56,389
Hey, Pierre, Pierre.
Just do one thing. Do one thing.

625
00:34:56,493 --> 00:34:58,440
Turn the TV on.

626
00:34:58,544 --> 00:35:00,167
What?

627
00:35:00,271 --> 00:35:02,357
Please.

628
00:35:02,422 --> 00:35:04,507
Turn on the TV.

629
00:35:05,279 --> 00:35:06,729
Here we are.

630
00:35:06,834 --> 00:35:09,049
In the stylish loft...

631
00:35:09,302 --> 00:35:10,615
...of Katya.

632
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:12,692
America's lightest whit dream.

633
00:35:12,796 --> 00:35:15,406
So Katya, America
really wants to know...

634
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:20,916
Just why exactly did you rob them
of such a spectacular wreck?

635
00:35:22,611 --> 00:35:26,697
Well, I am going to be
a serious actress now and...

636
00:35:26,801 --> 00:35:29,553
They would have just gotten in
the way of my iambic pentameter.

637
00:35:29,658 --> 00:35:32,317
Did he charge you by the outs?

638
00:35:32,397 --> 00:35:33,377
Who?

639
00:35:33,482 --> 00:35:34,547
The surgeon.

640
00:35:34,651 --> 00:35:38,523
I mean let's be honest, there was a
hell of a lot to excavate in there.

641
00:35:38,627 --> 00:35:41,883
Well, of course. But you know,
I got a deal for doing them both.

642
00:35:41,987 --> 00:35:43,477
A shrewd shopper.

643
00:35:43,581 --> 00:35:45,591
All girls are gonna
make ends meet.

644
00:35:45,695 --> 00:35:49,384
Now would you show us your new tits,
unspectacular as they may be?

645
00:35:49,488 --> 00:35:53,207
You know I can't do that
because I'm a serious actress now.

646
00:35:53,311 --> 00:35:55,418
Nicole Kidman did it.

647
00:35:55,522 --> 00:35:56,545
Really?

648
00:35:56,649 --> 00:35:58,229
In that case.

649
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:01,257
Why don't you just zoom right in?

650
00:36:06,492 --> 00:36:08,577
What's that from?

651
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:11,515
My breast surgery.

652
00:36:12,084 --> 00:36:14,343
Never trust a blind surgeon.

653
00:36:14,447 --> 00:36:15,988
Seriously.

654
00:36:16,092 --> 00:36:17,357
What's it from?

655
00:36:17,462 --> 00:36:20,143
Look, we're not here
to talk about me, are we?

656
00:36:20,247 --> 00:36:21,797
Besides, I doubt you'd
really wanna know.

657
00:36:21,901 --> 00:36:22,731
But I do.

658
00:36:22,835 --> 00:36:24,391
No. You know what?

659
00:36:24,495 --> 00:36:25,945
You don't.

660
00:36:26,049 --> 00:36:29,661
All right. Fine, Mr. Tough Guy,
war correspondent.

661
00:36:29,764 --> 00:36:33,575
I'm sorry that I asked you anything
about your miserable little life.

662
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:38,573
Now can we just get this over with, please?
Because I'm tired.

663
00:36:38,677 --> 00:36:41,247
And bleeding. Don't forget.

664
00:36:42,458 --> 00:36:45,914
Any more dull questions? Shoot.

665
00:36:47,322 --> 00:36:48,833
It was a grenade.

666
00:36:48,937 --> 00:36:53,038
Oh please, Mr. Tintin.
We're not here to talk about you.

667
00:36:53,143 --> 00:36:55,228
And why are we here?

668
00:36:55,315 --> 00:37:00,986
If you're gonna talk philosophy to me,
I will really fall asleep.

669
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:09,172
You know, I don't find you
funny at all, Ms. Katya?

670
00:37:09,276 --> 00:37:12,541
Why won't you try
becoming a person first?

671
00:37:12,646 --> 00:37:14,322
Instead of a...

672
00:37:14,427 --> 00:37:17,261
Rich spoiled brat.

673
00:37:17,365 --> 00:37:20,314
Who knows how
to turn on the charm.

674
00:37:20,419 --> 00:37:22,841
That's not the same
as having talent.

675
00:37:22,946 --> 00:37:25,339
Which I don't see you
having much of.

676
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:27,150
I tell you what you're
good at, though.

677
00:37:27,254 --> 00:37:29,340
You're good at lying.

678
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:32,926
But you lie mostly to yourself.

679
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:38,794
Are you awake?

680
00:37:39,648 --> 00:37:42,042
Hanging on every word, pap.

681
00:37:43,913 --> 00:37:45,408
Right.

682
00:37:45,512 --> 00:37:47,597
'I'm good at crying.'

683
00:37:49,578 --> 00:37:53,054
Well, you're good at
getting what you want.

684
00:37:53,158 --> 00:37:55,244
A whore...

685
00:37:55,726 --> 00:37:57,811
Call me a whore.

686
00:37:58,522 --> 00:38:00,374
A whore in Sarajevo.

687
00:38:00,479 --> 00:38:02,616
At the Hotel Gainsbourg.

688
00:38:02,802 --> 00:38:05,372
Fell in love with my brother.

689
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:10,272
Your brother?

690
00:38:10,376 --> 00:38:11,152
Go on.

691
00:38:11,256 --> 00:38:12,513
Yeah.

692
00:38:12,617 --> 00:38:15,907
My brother, Robert,
fell in love with her, too.

693
00:38:16,011 --> 00:38:18,564
Then he goes and
he gets her pregnant.

694
00:38:18,669 --> 00:38:21,143
And he was so happy.

695
00:38:21,247 --> 00:38:24,455
He's a - or he was a -
photographer.

696
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:26,644
Photojournalist.

697
00:38:28,166 --> 00:38:31,451
He got this really
nice shot of Marica once.

698
00:38:31,556 --> 00:38:32,983
That's the whore.

699
00:38:33,088 --> 00:38:36,236
In front of a bombed out market
with some little kids.

700
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:41,405
In fact it made it into our magazine,
and I wrote the accompanying story.

701
00:38:41,509 --> 00:38:44,788
We used to do that sometimes.

702
00:38:48,424 --> 00:38:51,526
Just pretend I'm not here.

703
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:57,247
Well, long story short...

704
00:38:57,351 --> 00:39:02,580
Marica was captured by some
soldiers led by Olek Maholevec.

705
00:39:03,115 --> 00:39:06,124
And Olek raped her.

706
00:39:06,653 --> 00:39:08,310
Then he gives her to his men.

707
00:39:08,414 --> 00:39:11,473
And they rape her.
Then do you know what they did?

708
00:39:11,577 --> 00:39:14,085
They ripped open her belly.

709
00:39:14,412 --> 00:39:17,479
And they tore out the fetus.

710
00:39:17,993 --> 00:39:19,667
And they put that in a pot.

711
00:39:19,772 --> 00:39:22,075
And sent it to my brother.

712
00:39:24,841 --> 00:39:26,918
After they healed her up...

713
00:39:27,022 --> 00:39:28,989
I thought you said
this was gonna be short.

714
00:39:29,093 --> 00:39:31,178
Olek said to her,

715
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:34,455
'You can go kill your boyfriend.'

716
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:38,605
'And if you don't, we will.
But first we'll kill your whole family.'

717
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,794
'And then you.'

718
00:39:41,774 --> 00:39:43,780
So, they gave her a grenade.

719
00:39:43,885 --> 00:39:46,834
And one night she
shows up at the hotel bar.

720
00:39:46,938 --> 00:39:49,215
And she pulls the pin.

721
00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:52,659
Six dead including two children.

722
00:39:53,871 --> 00:39:57,171
Well, there was nothing
left of poor Marica.

723
00:39:57,342 --> 00:40:00,770
Except a piece of her thigh.

724
00:40:01,241 --> 00:40:02,375
But do you know what?

725
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:07,180
I really don't remember if
she was wearing fishnets or not.

726
00:40:07,273 --> 00:40:09,358
I'm sorry.

727
00:40:11,311 --> 00:40:13,792
I'm sorry that I hurt you.

728
00:40:14,963 --> 00:40:19,748
I was indeed acting like
a spoiled brat.

729
00:40:20,213 --> 00:40:23,076
I should have
poked out your eyes.

730
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,988
Feel like dessert?

731
00:40:25,093 --> 00:40:26,342
No thanks.

732
00:40:26,446 --> 00:40:29,066
I have fetus and syrup.

733
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:32,264
You were unbelievable.
Do you know that?

734
00:40:32,368 --> 00:40:34,399
I have a headache.
Do you mind if I lie down?

735
00:40:34,503 --> 00:40:37,488
Well, not only is that the first
real question you've asked me.

736
00:40:37,592 --> 00:40:40,354
It's also the best that
I have ever had from a journalist.

737
00:40:40,459 --> 00:40:42,941
Please, lie on my sofa.

738
00:40:43,168 --> 00:40:44,435
Do you have any Tylenol?

739
00:40:44,539 --> 00:40:46,430
It's another good question.

740
00:40:46,534 --> 00:40:49,114
I'm afraid that I do have some Tylenol.

741
00:40:49,218 --> 00:40:51,304
But no arsenic.

742
00:40:51,656 --> 00:40:56,795
You know, that would get rid of
your headache a lot faster.

743
00:41:02,384 --> 00:41:04,470
Thank you.

744
00:41:11,556 --> 00:41:13,640
Do you know what?

745
00:41:14,151 --> 00:41:17,165
Maybe journalism is not for me.

746
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:22,283
Maybe I am just a big fat failure.

747
00:41:25,033 --> 00:41:28,312
Hey, I never said you were a failure.

748
00:41:34,581 --> 00:41:37,239
What happened to her family?

749
00:41:37,933 --> 00:41:40,017
Marica? I don't know.

750
00:41:42,597 --> 00:41:44,682
And your brother?

751
00:41:44,994 --> 00:41:48,533
One suicide attempt after another.

752
00:41:48,637 --> 00:41:50,853
Why does he keep failing?

753
00:41:51,271 --> 00:41:54,550
I think just to torture me.

754
00:41:54,751 --> 00:41:59,182
Do you realize
that you're unpleasant?

755
00:42:06,348 --> 00:42:09,538
I'm sorry.
I forgot to call you back.

756
00:42:09,601 --> 00:42:11,424
Did you watch?

757
00:42:11,528 --> 00:42:13,613
No.
You were amazing.

758
00:42:15,878 --> 00:42:17,962
I was terrible.

759
00:43:48,331 --> 00:43:50,417
I don't love Evan.

760
00:43:50,543 --> 00:43:56,303
Sometimes, I think I'm just using him
to keep the darkness at bay.

761
00:43:56,365 --> 00:44:00,539
Yes, he's handsome.
But when he wants to make love, I cringe.

762
00:44:00,644 --> 00:44:04,605
I don't know why, I can't stand
the thought of him inside me.

763
00:44:04,709 --> 00:44:08,102
I should break it off.
But I'm a coward.

764
00:44:08,206 --> 00:44:10,900
Death is all around me.

765
00:44:11,057 --> 00:44:13,952
Around me and in me.

766
00:44:17,406 --> 00:44:19,887
I'm googling you.

767
00:44:34,404 --> 00:44:35,719
Great stuff.

768
00:44:35,823 --> 00:44:39,908
I did an interview for Vogue last year.
There's some good stuff in that
if you want to use it.

769
00:44:39,972 --> 00:44:40,698
Thank you.

770
00:44:40,699 --> 00:44:42,078
I'm back.

771
00:45:10,816 --> 00:45:12,902
Nice.

772
00:45:13,613 --> 00:45:15,739
Oh, don't look at those.

773
00:45:17,064 --> 00:45:18,608
Why not?

774
00:45:18,712 --> 00:45:21,093
I look like a slut.

775
00:45:21,197 --> 00:45:23,282
Yeah.

776
00:45:23,777 --> 00:45:27,476
You know you are really starting
to get on my nerves, Pierre.

777
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:30,505
Well, that's what I do. You know?

778
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:31,502
So.

779
00:45:31,607 --> 00:45:34,177
Tell me about your boyfriend.

780
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:37,413
You know I'm really tired.

781
00:45:38,404 --> 00:45:40,571
Well, I can really use
some more time with you.

782
00:45:40,675 --> 00:45:42,626
I mean now I feel like
I'm just getting started.

783
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:45,477
Haven't you got enough already?

784
00:45:45,622 --> 00:45:47,749
Just a few more minutes.

785
00:45:54,003 --> 00:45:56,089
Okay, you.

786
00:45:56,779 --> 00:45:58,864
Follow me.

787
00:46:16,922 --> 00:46:18,829
You want some?

788
00:46:18,933 --> 00:46:20,831
No thanks.

789
00:46:21,024 --> 00:46:23,077
Ah, don't look so disappointed.

790
00:46:23,181 --> 00:46:25,749
You'll make me cry again.

791
00:46:25,853 --> 00:46:27,342
You know what?
I'm pretty tired.

792
00:46:27,446 --> 00:46:28,447
Maybe I should go.

793
00:46:28,551 --> 00:46:32,510
Well, now I'm sure you
have plenty to write about.

794
00:46:32,615 --> 00:46:33,876
Don't worry.
I won't write about this.

795
00:46:33,981 --> 00:46:36,500
Well, then have some.
So I know I can trust you.

796
00:46:36,605 --> 00:46:38,690
Is that coke?

797
00:46:38,978 --> 00:46:41,063
It's not heroin, is it?

798
00:46:42,844 --> 00:46:45,147
Yeah. Okay.
This is stupid.

799
00:46:48,964 --> 00:46:52,813
You know what? Take my very
expensive bottle of Scotch with you.

800
00:46:52,917 --> 00:46:55,399
If there's anything left.

801
00:46:57,179 --> 00:46:59,265
Fuck you.

802
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,641
Why are you such a fuckface?

803
00:47:05,283 --> 00:47:09,182
Well, certain people just
bring it out of me.

804
00:47:10,502 --> 00:47:12,367
What are you...?

805
00:47:12,471 --> 00:47:15,307
Jesus. Yes, it's really funny.

806
00:47:17,108 --> 00:47:18,867
Yeah.
I try to look very stupid to you.

807
00:47:18,971 --> 00:47:21,193
No. It's stupid of me.
Stupid of me.

808
00:47:21,298 --> 00:47:23,382
Watch my glasses.

809
00:47:24,483 --> 00:47:26,436
You know, you gotta learn to relax.

810
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:28,670
I'm completely relaxed.

811
00:47:28,984 --> 00:47:29,989
Are you bleeding again?

812
00:47:30,093 --> 00:47:31,789
Do you need me
to get you a damn towel?

813
00:47:31,894 --> 00:47:33,979
I'm fine.

814
00:47:36,973 --> 00:47:39,059
Hey, Pierre.

815
00:47:39,585 --> 00:47:41,799
I'm not tired anymore.

816
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:52,332
Do you mind
if I use your bathroom?

817
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:54,521
Sure.

818
00:47:56,318 --> 00:47:58,399
Oh, that's just the bath.

819
00:47:58,503 --> 00:48:00,589
Toilet's next door.

820
00:48:17,043 --> 00:48:19,428
Death is all around me.

821
00:48:19,532 --> 00:48:21,822
Around me and in me.

822
00:48:22,078 --> 00:48:23,672
In my chest.

823
00:48:23,776 --> 00:48:24,985
In my gut.

824
00:48:25,089 --> 00:48:26,625
In my eyes.

825
00:48:26,729 --> 00:48:29,653
Everything I look at seems black.

826
00:48:45,417 --> 00:48:47,502
Over here.

827
00:48:54,062 --> 00:48:56,721
Well, now that looks relaxing.

828
00:48:57,158 --> 00:48:59,242
Oh, it is.

829
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:01,988
How is your head?

830
00:49:02,092 --> 00:49:04,178
I live.

831
00:49:04,574 --> 00:49:07,522
You're really getting
beat up today, huh?

832
00:49:07,627 --> 00:49:09,712
Well.

833
00:49:09,896 --> 00:49:12,377
It's an occupational hazard.

834
00:49:12,948 --> 00:49:15,580
Will you do something
for me, Pierre?

835
00:49:15,685 --> 00:49:17,395
I'll try.

836
00:49:17,499 --> 00:49:19,584
Write down your number.

837
00:49:19,795 --> 00:49:22,627
And I will call you.
And we'll finish this up tomorrow.

838
00:49:22,731 --> 00:49:23,757
Please.

839
00:49:23,861 --> 00:49:27,353
Try to be a little prepared. Okay?

840
00:49:27,457 --> 00:49:29,542
You got it.

841
00:49:31,079 --> 00:49:33,163
That's nice, isn't it?

842
00:49:33,932 --> 00:49:35,653
What?

843
00:49:35,758 --> 00:49:37,251
The music.

844
00:49:37,355 --> 00:49:39,441
Can't you hear it?

845
00:49:40,692 --> 00:49:42,778
Do you like it?

846
00:49:45,843 --> 00:49:47,929
Not really.

847
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:54,812
Will you put this out
for me please, Pierre?

848
00:49:54,916 --> 00:49:57,002
Yes, your highness.

849
00:49:58,382 --> 00:50:01,218
I'm not that high.

850
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:43,434
Look.

851
00:50:43,538 --> 00:50:46,294
I'm sorry if it seemed like
I was judging you.

852
00:50:46,398 --> 00:50:48,360
In there.

853
00:50:48,464 --> 00:50:50,188
Just surprised me. That's all.

854
00:50:50,292 --> 00:50:52,450
Oh, that shouldn't hap.

855
00:50:52,554 --> 00:50:56,206
Everybody knows
that I'm a crack whore.

856
00:50:56,315 --> 00:51:00,574
I have been with all kinds of whores
all over the world.

857
00:51:00,679 --> 00:51:04,627
And you my dear are
no crack whore.

858
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:10,090
You say the sweetest things to me
sometimes. Do you know that?

859
00:51:10,194 --> 00:51:12,279
I do, don't I?

860
00:51:13,328 --> 00:51:15,377
I must like you or something.

861
00:51:15,482 --> 00:51:17,567
Well of course you do.

862
00:51:18,407 --> 00:51:20,710
I drive men crazy.

863
00:51:21,273 --> 00:51:23,489
Boys too. But mostly men.

864
00:51:23,537 --> 00:51:28,201
You know, just the other day
my acting teacher tried to hit on me.

865
00:51:28,305 --> 00:51:32,832
And it was really disgusting, Pierre.
Because he's like your age.

866
00:51:32,936 --> 00:51:36,418
And I had so much
respect for him. You know?

867
00:51:36,522 --> 00:51:38,607
Who is this?

868
00:51:39,305 --> 00:51:41,389
He is the best.

869
00:51:41,644 --> 00:51:43,948
And everybody goes to him.

870
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:44,759
And...

871
00:51:44,863 --> 00:51:46,713
He tells you how to read your lines?

872
00:51:46,817 --> 00:51:49,129
Oh, we do exercises. You know.

873
00:51:49,233 --> 00:51:51,359
Character study and...

874
00:51:51,477 --> 00:51:53,723
Sense memory.

875
00:51:53,829 --> 00:51:56,846
I videotape my rehearsals.
He critiques them.

876
00:51:56,950 --> 00:51:58,522
All that crap.

877
00:51:58,626 --> 00:52:00,712
Watch out Meryl Streep!

878
00:52:00,804 --> 00:52:02,424
Take it easy pap.

879
00:52:02,528 --> 00:52:05,496
I am not your pap.

880
00:52:07,349 --> 00:52:11,248
You just look like him sometimes.
That's all.

881
00:52:11,669 --> 00:52:13,754
Your father?

882
00:52:13,952 --> 00:52:16,037
Yes.

883
00:52:17,322 --> 00:52:19,446
Well, give him my regards.

884
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:21,409
I will.

885
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,599
He's dead.

886
00:52:27,781 --> 00:52:29,866
So is my daughter.

887
00:52:30,701 --> 00:52:33,717
I thought you said
you didn't have any kids.

888
00:52:33,821 --> 00:52:35,907
Well, I don't anymore.

889
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,205
How did she die?

890
00:52:40,664 --> 00:52:42,749
Heroin overdose.

891
00:52:43,985 --> 00:52:46,212
19 years old.

892
00:52:48,624 --> 00:52:52,523
Well, I was off somewhere
in the Middle East.

893
00:52:52,655 --> 00:52:55,150
And what about your dad?

894
00:52:55,508 --> 00:52:58,294
Heart attack at fifty.

895
00:52:58,428 --> 00:53:00,732
I never met him.

896
00:53:01,705 --> 00:53:07,752
I've seen pictures, though. He was very
handsome in an odd sort of way.

897
00:53:07,856 --> 00:53:11,786
But a real asshole.
So I'm told.

898
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:14,904
He had no interest in me at all.

899
00:53:16,125 --> 00:53:18,211
And there's your scar.

900
00:53:18,489 --> 00:53:21,096
Well played, Dr. Freud.

901
00:53:25,973 --> 00:53:28,064
No more music.

902
00:53:28,166 --> 00:53:30,292
They must have gone to bed.

903
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:37,135
And what about us?

904
00:53:38,417 --> 00:53:41,498
I didn't know there was an us.

905
00:53:41,602 --> 00:53:44,509
You're right.
There's not, because...

906
00:53:44,613 --> 00:53:47,310
You hate me. Remember?

907
00:53:47,421 --> 00:53:49,507
And yet you kissed me.

908
00:53:50,275 --> 00:53:52,177
You kissed me.

909
00:53:52,281 --> 00:53:54,407
No. Why would I do that?

910
00:53:54,487 --> 00:53:56,572
I'm your father.

911
00:53:57,942 --> 00:53:59,822
You're weird.

912
00:53:59,926 --> 00:54:02,689
And you are my daughter.

913
00:54:05,298 --> 00:54:07,383
I'm not.

914
00:54:07,995 --> 00:54:09,296
That's right.

915
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,484
She's dead.

916
00:54:17,602 --> 00:54:19,687
You must be tired.

917
00:54:20,922 --> 00:54:23,008
Of your boyfriend.

918
00:54:23,186 --> 00:54:25,271
Excuse me?

919
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:27,654
Is that why you kissed me?

920
00:54:28,021 --> 00:54:29,739
Because I'm tired of him?

921
00:54:29,843 --> 00:54:30,999
Well.

922
00:54:31,103 --> 00:54:33,011
Or sick of him, actually.

923
00:54:33,116 --> 00:54:36,218
I mean you don't love
him anymore.

924
00:54:36,244 --> 00:54:39,644
You know what I'm gonna tell you,
Mr. Roving Reporter?

925
00:54:39,748 --> 00:54:41,328
We're in love.

926
00:54:41,432 --> 00:54:43,737
And we're getting married.

927
00:54:43,742 --> 00:54:45,441
That's a bad idea.

928
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:47,279
Why would you marry
someone you didn't love?

929
00:54:47,344 --> 00:54:50,394
And there's your big scoop!
Jesus, you're good.

930
00:54:50,498 --> 00:54:54,982
Because nobody in the entire world
even knows we're engaged.

931
00:54:55,086 --> 00:55:00,442
Except, you know, for people who read a
newspaper or a magazine. You dumb fuck!

932
00:55:00,546 --> 00:55:01,466
Hey. You know what?

933
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:04,228
Come here.
Where are you going?

934
00:55:05,097 --> 00:55:07,181
Katya?

935
00:55:12,159 --> 00:55:13,596
Is that him?

936
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:15,150
It's me.

937
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,137
Are you gonna let him in?

938
00:55:22,241 --> 00:55:24,325
I don't want to.

939
00:55:24,827 --> 00:55:26,913
Why not?

940
00:55:27,679 --> 00:55:29,126
Now just keep your
fucking voice down.

941
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:32,155
I would really like to meet him.

942
00:55:32,587 --> 00:55:34,671
I would.

943
00:55:38,121 --> 00:55:40,207
Doesn't he have a key?

944
00:55:41,146 --> 00:55:43,095
Nobody gets a key.

945
00:55:43,199 --> 00:55:45,285
Are you in there?

946
00:55:45,895 --> 00:55:47,981
I'm gonna let him in.

947
00:55:55,367 --> 00:55:59,178
Ah, God. You have got to
change that ringer.

948
00:55:59,270 --> 00:56:01,356
He's still there.

949
00:56:03,383 --> 00:56:04,516
Answer your phone.

950
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:06,706
Shut that up.

951
00:56:11,229 --> 00:56:13,314
Do something.

952
00:56:18,062 --> 00:56:20,147
Can I talk now?

953
00:56:22,041 --> 00:56:24,127
You can go now.

954
00:56:27,191 --> 00:56:29,275
Oh boy.

955
00:56:33,239 --> 00:56:35,005
Nice.

956
00:56:35,109 --> 00:56:36,498
Come on.
You don't need that shit.

957
00:56:36,602 --> 00:56:38,687
Oh fuck off already.

958
00:56:43,604 --> 00:56:45,707
Ah, you left me a little.

959
00:56:45,811 --> 00:56:46,705
How sweet of you.

960
00:56:46,809 --> 00:56:49,419
Is life really this hard for you?

961
00:56:49,524 --> 00:56:51,511
What can you possibly be
so depressed about?

962
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:53,659
I'm sorry, daddy.
Did you say something?

963
00:56:53,763 --> 00:56:55,841
Just get over yourself already.

964
00:56:55,945 --> 00:56:58,720
How are the whores
in Afghanistan, father?

965
00:56:58,824 --> 00:56:59,885
What? No whores?

966
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:01,918
Look at you. You could have
the world at your feet.

967
00:57:02,022 --> 00:57:03,541
But you prefer to piss
and moan about it.

968
00:57:03,646 --> 00:57:05,435
And then you act like
you're crazy, on top of it.

969
00:57:05,539 --> 00:57:06,720
How are the camels?

970
00:57:06,824 --> 00:57:09,632
Let me tell you something.
You're not crazy. Okay?

971
00:57:09,737 --> 00:57:11,901
Do you know
what your problem is?

972
00:57:12,005 --> 00:57:14,342
You're too normal.

973
00:57:14,446 --> 00:57:15,341
That's what it is. In fact...

974
00:57:15,445 --> 00:57:19,784
If I had a grenade,
I would stick it up your fucking ass.

975
00:57:19,889 --> 00:57:22,530
Why do you think anything you have
to say could possibly hurt me?

976
00:57:22,634 --> 00:57:24,605
I'll go find some war to fight.

977
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:25,618
Excuse me.

978
00:57:25,722 --> 00:57:26,842
Correspond with.

979
00:57:26,946 --> 00:57:28,704
You don't actually fight, do you?

980
00:57:28,808 --> 00:57:32,264
And you don't actually
love Ethan, do you?

981
00:57:32,368 --> 00:57:34,453
Who?

982
00:57:34,935 --> 00:57:37,021
What's his name...?

983
00:57:38,044 --> 00:57:40,130
Evan? Is that his name?

984
00:57:40,741 --> 00:57:43,222
Come on. You don't love him.

985
00:57:43,651 --> 00:57:45,269
And that's why you kissed me.

986
00:57:45,373 --> 00:57:47,980
And maybe that's why
you didn't let him in the door.

987
00:57:48,084 --> 00:57:51,426
I was protecting you.
- Whatever.

988
00:57:51,981 --> 00:57:55,581
The fact is you don't love him.
And why don't you just admit it?

989
00:57:55,685 --> 00:57:57,130
Tell the truth for once.

990
00:57:57,234 --> 00:58:00,135
Pierre, what the fuck are
you talking about?

991
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:01,402
I can prove it.

992
00:58:01,506 --> 00:58:03,864
Oh, my God. How?

993
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:06,024
Never mind how.

994
00:58:06,128 --> 00:58:08,227
Forget it. All right?
Let's just leave it at that.

995
00:58:08,332 --> 00:58:10,051
No. Pierre. Pierre.

996
00:58:10,156 --> 00:58:13,406
You can't say something like
that and then not do it.

997
00:58:13,510 --> 00:58:16,176
Prove to me.
Prove that I do not love him.

998
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:18,739
And I will do
anything you want.

999
00:58:18,843 --> 00:58:20,495
I don't want anything from you.

1000
00:58:20,599 --> 00:58:22,105
No?

1001
00:58:22,210 --> 00:58:24,941
You tried to dry hump me
on the kitchen counter earlier on.

1002
00:58:25,045 --> 00:58:27,783
Are you sure there isn't anything
you want from me, Pierre?

1003
00:58:27,888 --> 00:58:29,419
You like to gamble, huh?

1004
00:58:29,523 --> 00:58:31,727
God. I'm not gambling.

1005
00:58:31,832 --> 00:58:33,149
I am in love.

1006
00:58:33,253 --> 00:58:35,557
And I'm getting married.

1007
00:58:42,172 --> 00:58:44,258
What are you doing?

1008
00:58:48,092 --> 00:58:50,178
I don't love Evan.

1009
00:58:52,159 --> 00:58:55,527
When he wants to make love, I cringe.

1010
00:58:56,224 --> 00:58:59,757
I can't stand the
thought of him inside me.

1011
00:58:59,862 --> 00:59:01,947
Shall I go on?

1012
00:59:02,373 --> 00:59:03,482
Oh my God.

1013
00:59:03,587 --> 00:59:05,739
Or should I unzip?

1014
00:59:07,251 --> 00:59:11,150
You know what?
You're really sleazy.

1015
00:59:11,859 --> 00:59:14,524
Well, you wanted prove, didn't you?
There it is. You're a liar.

1016
00:59:14,628 --> 00:59:18,793
Is there any point
in saying that you're sick?

1017
00:59:18,977 --> 00:59:21,792
I'm not gonna use any of it.
It's just more for background.

1018
00:59:21,896 --> 00:59:23,776
Breaks into my computer.

1019
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,906
He reads my diary.
And he's proud of it?

1020
00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:30,757
Have you noticed that I have
about ten minutes on my tape?

1021
00:59:30,862 --> 00:59:33,635
And it's just us bickering.

1022
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:35,700
You talk on the phone all night.

1023
00:59:35,804 --> 00:59:38,391
You leave me out here alone.
You said I can use your computer.

1024
00:59:38,495 --> 00:59:39,951
And now you're surprised?

1025
00:59:40,055 --> 00:59:43,389
Why don't you just rape me now?
And get it over with.

1026
00:59:43,493 --> 00:59:48,285
I wanted to know about you.
You don't tell me anything.

1027
00:59:48,394 --> 00:59:49,610
You wanted to know me?

1028
00:59:49,611 --> 00:59:51,694
Why don't you have a
rifle through these, huh?

1029
00:59:51,798 --> 00:59:53,884
See what you can find.

1030
01:00:01,173 --> 01:00:02,596
Listen.

1031
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:04,692
I know you better than you think.

1032
01:00:04,796 --> 01:00:06,675
Go.

1033
01:00:06,779 --> 01:00:09,204
You just read my diary.

1034
01:00:09,309 --> 01:00:11,560
No. I hardly read any of it.

1035
01:00:11,786 --> 01:00:14,134
All right? But there was
something in there...

1036
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:16,445
That I read that I wanna
know more about.

1037
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:18,635
You could leave now.

1038
01:00:26,007 --> 01:00:29,888
Get away from my computer.
You sick bastard!

1039
01:00:38,233 --> 01:00:40,127
Death is all around me.

1040
01:00:40,231 --> 01:00:41,464
Around me and in me.

1041
01:00:41,568 --> 01:00:42,746
In my chest.

1042
01:00:42,851 --> 01:00:44,221
In my gut.

1043
01:00:44,325 --> 01:00:47,202
In my eyes.
Everything I look at seems black.

1044
01:00:47,306 --> 01:00:50,320
Black sky.
Black clouds. Black sun.

1045
01:00:50,388 --> 01:00:51,967
Black. Black. Black.

1046
01:00:52,071 --> 01:00:53,729
That is stealing! You...

1047
01:00:53,833 --> 01:00:56,284
You prick. What?
Are you gonna sell it to the tabloids?

1048
01:00:56,388 --> 01:00:59,172
No. I would never do that.
I swear.

1049
01:00:59,276 --> 01:01:02,643
But I wanna know
why you feel this way.

1050
01:01:03,056 --> 01:01:04,185
Katya.

1051
01:01:04,289 --> 01:01:06,374
Get out.

1052
01:01:25,958 --> 01:01:31,718
Here. You can have that.
I don't even want it. Just delete it all.

1053
01:01:31,786 --> 01:01:32,491
Okay. Look.

1054
01:01:32,595 --> 01:01:35,228
I know you're not gonna
believe me when I tell you this.

1055
01:01:35,332 --> 01:01:38,966
But I do care
about you very much.

1056
01:01:39,616 --> 01:01:43,580
I don't care about your diary.
Or the rest of it.

1057
01:01:43,684 --> 01:01:49,977
And I don't care about who you marry
or why. That's none of my business.

1058
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:55,989
But Katya, please. I wanna know
why you feel like there's no hope.

1059
01:01:56,093 --> 01:01:59,726
I swear to God
I will call the police.

1060
01:02:07,412 --> 01:02:08,734
Hi sweetie.

1061
01:02:08,838 --> 01:02:10,816
What's going on over there?

1062
01:02:10,921 --> 01:02:12,884
Honey, did you come by before?

1063
01:02:12,989 --> 01:02:16,967
I was in the shower.
But I thought I heard banging.

1064
01:02:17,053 --> 01:02:19,149
Oh, God. No, I mean...

1065
01:02:19,576 --> 01:02:23,805
Because I started bleeding, sweetie.
Remember?

1066
01:02:23,909 --> 01:02:26,765
No. I just...
I have a cold. That's all.

1067
01:02:26,870 --> 01:02:28,955
What message?

1068
01:02:29,505 --> 01:02:34,678
No. I have been on the phone to Maggie
all night. She's just freaking out again.

1069
01:02:34,783 --> 01:02:36,319
I don't know.

1070
01:02:36,423 --> 01:02:39,216
Baby, listen.
I need to get some sleep. Okay?

1071
01:02:39,217 --> 01:02:43,151
If I don't, I'm just
gonna be a wreck tomorrow.

1072
01:02:43,256 --> 01:02:45,341
I love you.

1073
01:02:45,926 --> 01:02:47,123
Yeah, me too.

1074
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:48,855
Bye.

1075
01:02:52,236 --> 01:02:54,322
I'm not going anywhere.

1076
01:02:55,094 --> 01:02:58,223
I just don't wanna play your
games anymore, Pierre.

1077
01:02:58,327 --> 01:02:59,440
No. This isn't a game.

1078
01:02:59,544 --> 01:03:01,937
This is not a game from me.

1079
01:03:02,531 --> 01:03:03,941
This is very real.

1080
01:03:04,044 --> 01:03:06,276
Go ahead.
Do you wanna call the police?

1081
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:11,591
Cause that'll be in the papers tomorrow
morning. Is that what you want?

1082
01:03:13,622 --> 01:03:15,651
Look. I wanna know what's
haunting you.

1083
01:03:15,755 --> 01:03:17,840
Why?

1084
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:21,034
Because I feel haunted, too.

1085
01:03:28,238 --> 01:03:31,878
Maybe things aren't as
bad as you think.

1086
01:03:31,982 --> 01:03:37,034
And would you tell me
your deepest, darkest secret?

1087
01:03:37,385 --> 01:03:39,511
You have one, don't you?

1088
01:03:40,666 --> 01:03:42,750
Why do you wanna know?

1089
01:03:42,931 --> 01:03:45,016
I don't.

1090
01:03:45,214 --> 01:03:48,758
But it's the only way
I'll tell you mine.

1091
01:03:57,963 --> 01:04:00,089
Where is your camcorder?

1092
01:04:00,584 --> 01:04:02,977
It's in my bag.
- Go get it.

1093
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:06,378
Why? I don't wanna record this.
- I do.

1094
01:04:06,381 --> 01:04:07,298
What for?

1095
01:04:07,403 --> 01:04:09,311
Because then we'll feel like
an interview, Pierre.

1096
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:11,070
A professional interview.

1097
01:04:11,113 --> 01:04:17,714
And not some weird, surrogate
father-daughter bonding moment.

1098
01:04:31,573 --> 01:04:33,789
I get to record you, too.

1099
01:04:37,537 --> 01:04:39,622
Fine.

1100
01:04:45,604 --> 01:04:50,124
I'm gonna have to read this. Okay?
That'll be easier.

1101
01:05:08,902 --> 01:05:10,105
Monday.

1102
01:05:12,986 --> 01:05:15,999
Today my sentence
was handed down.

1103
01:05:16,126 --> 01:05:18,695
The X-rays were clear.

1104
01:05:19,493 --> 01:05:21,577
I have cancer.

1105
01:05:23,145 --> 01:05:27,842
I asked Dr. Abrahams
if I'm going to die.

1106
01:05:28,866 --> 01:05:33,355
He said he couldn't tell how
far it's progressed.

1107
01:05:33,459 --> 01:05:36,537
I asked him,
am I going to lose my breast?

1108
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:40,363
He said he'd be happiest
if we removed it.

1109
01:05:41,134 --> 01:05:43,922
I asked him what happens if
it has progressed further.

1110
01:05:44,026 --> 01:05:45,821
He said we should wait and see.

1111
01:05:45,925 --> 01:05:47,245
Take it a step at a time.

1112
01:05:47,349 --> 01:05:49,860
But that I should give up smoking.

1113
01:05:49,964 --> 01:05:52,049
And drinking.

1114
01:05:53,031 --> 01:05:58,791
I can't imagine telling anyone
for I fear it will become too real.

1115
01:06:14,786 --> 01:06:15,780
Are you okay?

1116
01:06:15,884 --> 01:06:17,969
Yeah. I'll be fine.

1117
01:06:22,774 --> 01:06:28,263
Jesus, you're a pill popping alcoholic.
No wonder you didn't need any blow.

1118
01:06:28,367 --> 01:06:30,451
Here.

1119
01:06:45,741 --> 01:06:47,826
Hey, I do have Bourbon.

1120
01:07:03,746 --> 01:07:05,830
Does anybody else know?

1121
01:07:06,398 --> 01:07:08,484
No.

1122
01:07:08,781 --> 01:07:12,326
God. I have been
horrible to you tonight.

1123
01:07:12,358 --> 01:07:16,878
I haven't exactly been
Miss Sunshine myself, have I?

1124
01:07:17,142 --> 01:07:19,226
What will you write?

1125
01:07:21,435 --> 01:07:23,052
Nothing. No. No.

1126
01:07:23,157 --> 01:07:28,036
I'm gonna tell my editor
that I walked out of the interview.

1127
01:07:28,140 --> 01:07:31,242
Very unprofessional of me.

1128
01:07:31,505 --> 01:07:34,519
And in the end
he was a gentleman.

1129
01:07:37,013 --> 01:07:41,415
I don't know about that.
I've been a real jerk tonight.

1130
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:44,266
I'm sorry. I didn't use to be.

1131
01:07:49,793 --> 01:07:51,329
Listen.

1132
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:53,543
I have tortured you enough.

1133
01:07:53,648 --> 01:07:55,733
You should get some rest.

1134
01:08:01,476 --> 01:08:03,562
I knew it.

1135
01:08:04,815 --> 01:08:06,765
What?

1136
01:08:06,870 --> 01:08:09,705
Aren't you forgetting something?

1137
01:08:11,891 --> 01:08:13,754
You can't be serious.

1138
01:08:13,859 --> 01:08:15,944
Serious as cancer.

1139
01:08:17,097 --> 01:08:18,760
Katya, I'm telling you...

1140
01:08:18,864 --> 01:08:21,112
My story pales in comparison.

1141
01:08:21,217 --> 01:08:22,853
It's not a competition, Pierre.

1142
01:08:22,957 --> 01:08:24,379
We made a deal.

1143
01:08:24,484 --> 01:08:25,541
I know.
But that was before.

1144
01:08:25,645 --> 01:08:28,406
That's when deals are made.
Before.

1145
01:08:28,510 --> 01:08:29,885
Okay, look.
Don't get mad at me.

1146
01:08:29,989 --> 01:08:32,074
I really don't
have anything to tell you.

1147
01:08:32,179 --> 01:08:34,958
Don't you dare do this to me.
I can't believe you're doing this to me.

1148
01:08:35,062 --> 01:08:37,088
I am sick of your little games.

1149
01:08:37,193 --> 01:08:38,809
It's not a game. I...

1150
01:08:38,913 --> 01:08:42,441
I'm sorry. I lied. Okay?
I don't have anything to tell you.

1151
01:08:42,545 --> 01:08:44,630
No. You're lying now.

1152
01:08:44,790 --> 01:08:46,165
Katya. Don't...!

1153
01:08:46,269 --> 01:08:47,326
Don't what?

1154
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:48,725
Don't what?
Act like I'm crazy?

1155
01:08:48,829 --> 01:08:51,333
I'm not crazy, Pierre.
I just wanna kill you.

1156
01:08:51,438 --> 01:08:53,271
I wanna rip your insides out.

1157
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:56,884
You filthy, sleazy, disgusting,
lying son of a bitch.

1158
01:08:56,988 --> 01:08:58,266
Stop it.

1159
01:08:58,370 --> 01:09:00,474
Get your hands off me.

1160
01:09:00,578 --> 01:09:02,662
Let it go.

1161
01:09:32,807 --> 01:09:34,604
Okay. Go.

1162
01:09:35,432 --> 01:09:38,025
Marica, the whore...

1163
01:09:39,013 --> 01:09:40,902
She did lose the baby, but...

1164
01:09:41,006 --> 01:09:47,154
They never cut her open and ripped
out the fetus and put it in a pot.

1165
01:09:47,259 --> 01:09:51,955
I just said that to make
the story more interesting.

1166
01:09:52,365 --> 01:09:54,544
I do that a lot lately.

1167
01:09:54,648 --> 01:09:56,794
Past few years.

1168
01:09:56,898 --> 01:09:59,341
Especially in my reporting.

1169
01:10:00,112 --> 01:10:03,923
I have a lot of non-existent sources.

1170
01:10:05,759 --> 01:10:11,165
And that's why I was not in Washington
when the scandal broke.

1171
01:10:12,193 --> 01:10:18,130
Because Larry, my editor at the magazine,
doesn't trust me anymore.

1172
01:10:18,426 --> 01:10:19,421
'Pierre.'

1173
01:10:19,526 --> 01:10:24,754
'I think you should start
doing people profiles.'

1174
01:10:27,514 --> 01:10:32,920
And that's why I get stuck doing
these God-awful fluff pieces.

1175
01:10:36,915 --> 01:10:39,000
Sorry.

1176
01:10:41,566 --> 01:10:43,373
Oh, is that it?

1177
01:10:43,477 --> 01:10:44,826
Is that your secret?

1178
01:10:44,931 --> 01:10:47,016
Just getting warmed up.

1179
01:10:47,971 --> 01:10:49,763
My real secret.

1180
01:10:49,867 --> 01:10:51,953
My real shame.

1181
01:10:53,533 --> 01:10:55,193
Is after Lisa died.

1182
01:10:55,297 --> 01:10:57,382
It's my daughter.

1183
01:11:00,393 --> 01:11:02,537
It's like I said.
I was never really there for her.

1184
01:11:02,641 --> 01:11:05,127
But neither was my wife, Brenda.

1185
01:11:05,231 --> 01:11:07,831
Even though she got sole custody.

1186
01:11:07,935 --> 01:11:11,303
We were divorced
when Lisa was three.

1187
01:11:11,761 --> 01:11:12,728
Anyway.

1188
01:11:12,832 --> 01:11:14,917
After Lisa's death...

1189
01:11:15,057 --> 01:11:16,465
Brenda and I...

1190
01:11:16,569 --> 01:11:20,559
In our grief or whatever,
we sort of got back together.

1191
01:11:20,663 --> 01:11:22,736
And things were
starting to look up.

1192
01:11:22,840 --> 01:11:25,381
Till she started drinking again.

1193
01:11:25,485 --> 01:11:30,714
And I started to resent her,
and blame her for Lisa's death.

1194
01:11:31,404 --> 01:11:35,038
And we would have
these horrible fights.

1195
01:11:36,583 --> 01:11:38,976
I mean really ugly.

1196
01:11:39,552 --> 01:11:41,636
And physical.

1197
01:11:43,688 --> 01:11:46,169
Well, one day I got this....

1198
01:11:46,184 --> 01:11:49,532
Desperate call from Brenda
when I was at work.

1199
01:11:49,637 --> 01:11:54,897
'Please, Pierre, come over.
I'm scared. I'm really scared.'

1200
01:11:55,001 --> 01:11:57,236
I could tell she was out of it.

1201
01:11:57,340 --> 01:12:00,089
But I took my sweet time
getting over there.

1202
01:12:00,193 --> 01:12:03,619
In fact, it was hours later.
And when I got there, she was...

1203
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:06,166
Passed out on the floor.

1204
01:12:06,271 --> 01:12:09,198
I mean she'd obviously been drinking.

1205
01:12:09,302 --> 01:12:13,064
But I also saw a bottle of her pills...

1206
01:12:13,168 --> 01:12:16,624
An empty bottle
of pills on the couch.

1207
01:12:16,877 --> 01:12:19,003
I didn't touch anything.

1208
01:12:19,301 --> 01:12:25,416
And I didn't even get close enough
to her to see if she was breathing.

1209
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:28,835
You murdered your wife?

1210
01:12:36,207 --> 01:12:36,925
Well.

1211
01:12:37,030 --> 01:12:40,663
I went home and I drank
myself to sleep.

1212
01:12:42,369 --> 01:12:45,736
In fact I was still drunk
the next day.

1213
01:12:46,206 --> 01:12:53,384
When the police informed me that I was
the last person that she had called.

1214
01:12:55,965 --> 01:13:01,991
So. Yeah, I guess you can say
I murdered my wife.

1215
01:13:09,945 --> 01:13:12,516
I'm very tired, Pierre.

1216
01:13:13,184 --> 01:13:15,269
Yeah. Me too.

1217
01:13:38,192 --> 01:13:40,277
Katya.

1218
01:13:41,187 --> 01:13:44,093
What the hell
happened here tonight?

1219
01:13:44,198 --> 01:13:46,282
I don't know.

1220
01:13:47,437 --> 01:13:50,449
Things did get
a little crazy, huh?

1221
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:52,545
A little?

1222
01:13:53,784 --> 01:13:55,870
I'll get your things.

1223
01:14:02,029 --> 01:14:04,599
I have one more confession.

1224
01:14:06,836 --> 01:14:11,515
If I don't get some sleep, Pierre,
I'm gonna kill myself.

1225
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:16,122
Just finish your drink.
I'll get your things. Okay?

1226
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:53,634
Hey, did you find my...?

1227
01:14:53,738 --> 01:14:56,478
Camcorder and your palm?

1228
01:14:56,582 --> 01:14:58,666
You wanna check?

1229
01:15:02,244 --> 01:15:04,330
No. I trust you.

1230
01:15:11,346 --> 01:15:13,669
Pierre, do you mind
taking the stairs?

1231
01:15:13,774 --> 01:15:19,533
I just get scared in the elevator
on my own at this time of night.

1232
01:15:19,577 --> 01:15:21,975
You have been very
gracious this evening.

1233
01:15:22,079 --> 01:15:25,712
But I have one more
question, if you will.

1234
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:27,862
What do we have in common?

1235
01:15:27,967 --> 01:15:30,519
We don't believe in relationships.

1236
01:15:30,624 --> 01:15:32,570
I knew it.

1237
01:15:32,674 --> 01:15:35,206
You're right.
There is no equality.

1238
01:15:35,310 --> 01:15:37,968
No. There is always a winner.

1239
01:15:38,502 --> 01:15:40,587
And a loser.

1240
01:15:42,482 --> 01:15:44,567
Exactly.

1241
01:15:56,789 --> 01:15:58,874
One more thing.

1242
01:16:10,129 --> 01:16:12,213
Hey, Larry. It's me.

1243
01:16:13,338 --> 01:16:17,658
No. I just... I wanted to give
you a heads up on the Katya-piece.

1244
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:22,330
'First, you don't wanna go....'

1245
01:16:22,434 --> 01:16:23,301
Wait a minute.

1246
01:16:23,404 --> 01:16:25,490
No. Listen to me.

1247
01:16:26,031 --> 01:16:28,115
She's got cancer.

1248
01:16:28,327 --> 01:16:30,780
Yes, of course, she told me.
She told me everything.

1249
01:16:30,884 --> 01:16:35,385
We should get this in soon,
before she tells anybody else.

1250
01:16:35,489 --> 01:16:37,049
'We're not going with that.'

1251
01:16:37,153 --> 01:16:39,239
Why not?

1252
01:16:42,544 --> 01:16:46,470
Maybe it's some kind of weird
coincidence. I don't know.

1253
01:16:46,574 --> 01:16:48,696
Look.
I know what she told me.

1254
01:16:48,801 --> 01:16:52,135
Plus I have a copy of her diary.
- How did you get that?

1255
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:55,871
Never mind how I got it.
I just do.

1256
01:16:56,375 --> 01:16:58,452
Yeah. We'll see about that.

1257
01:16:58,556 --> 01:17:01,038
I gotta go, Larry. Bye.

1258
01:17:09,627 --> 01:17:11,334
Changed your mind?

1259
01:17:11,438 --> 01:17:13,524
About what?

1260
01:17:19,970 --> 01:17:20,388
Hey!

1261
01:17:20,492 --> 01:17:22,578
I'm up here.

1262
01:17:24,410 --> 01:17:26,496
Hi, Pierre.

1263
01:17:26,707 --> 01:17:27,761
What's up?

1264
01:17:27,865 --> 01:17:32,265
I forgot to tell you something.
I hope you'll forgive me.

1265
01:17:32,370 --> 01:17:34,121
Shoot.

1266
01:17:34,225 --> 01:17:36,617
My boyfriend's name is Ray.

1267
01:17:37,934 --> 01:17:39,389
Ray?

1268
01:17:39,495 --> 01:17:40,351
Yeah.

1269
01:17:40,401 --> 01:17:41,581
Ray.

1270
01:17:41,685 --> 01:17:44,263
I just wanted to be
clear about that.

1271
01:17:44,367 --> 01:17:45,752
So who's Evan?

1272
01:17:45,857 --> 01:17:47,942
Amy's boyfriend.

1273
01:17:48,747 --> 01:17:50,597
And Amy would be...?

1274
01:17:50,701 --> 01:17:52,109
City Girls?

1275
01:17:52,214 --> 01:17:54,783
Your favorite show.
Remember?

1276
01:17:59,559 --> 01:18:02,771
So your diary is just
a script from your show?

1277
01:18:02,919 --> 01:18:04,849
No, I wrote that. Thank you.

1278
01:18:05,001 --> 01:18:06,533
As Amy, of course.

1279
01:18:06,653 --> 01:18:09,337
It was one of
my acting exercises.

1280
01:18:09,468 --> 01:18:12,180
And you know,
she's the one who is sick.

1281
01:18:12,447 --> 01:18:15,509
With cancer.

1282
01:18:17,739 --> 01:18:19,765
Pierre?

1283
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:23,910
No. No. Wait!

1284
01:18:24,014 --> 01:18:25,485
Pierre. Pierre.

1285
01:18:25,589 --> 01:18:27,130
You have my tape.

1286
01:18:27,235 --> 01:18:29,981
Well, I guess it's my tape now.

1287
01:18:30,048 --> 01:18:32,297
You took my rehearsal tape.

1288
01:18:32,402 --> 01:18:35,415
I have your confession
right here.

1289
01:18:38,829 --> 01:18:41,097
Should I send it to your editor?

1290
01:18:41,201 --> 01:18:43,287
Or the police?

1291
01:18:52,107 --> 01:18:54,410
Should we run at it again?

1292
01:18:54,531 --> 01:18:55,868
Shit. I'm late.

1293
01:18:55,973 --> 01:18:56,825
For what?

1294
01:18:57,029 --> 01:18:59,013
Another interview.

1295
01:18:59,339 --> 01:19:01,424
With who?

1296
01:19:01,807 --> 01:19:03,892
I have no idea.

1297
01:19:19,090 --> 01:19:24,415
And that's why I get stuck
doing these God-awful fluff pieces.

1298
01:19:30,249 --> 01:19:31,516
I'm sorry.
