1
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:38,737
Hey!

2
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:40,839
Man.
Hey! Hey!

3
00:00:45,478 --> 00:00:47,079
Yaah!

4
00:00:53,354 --> 00:00:55,654
God!

5
00:00:57,992 --> 00:01:01,193
Damn it!

6
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:10,963
<i>Evil women and whiskey<i>

7
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:14,867
<i>Surely drive me
to my grave<i>

8
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,905
<i>Evil women and whiskey<i>

9
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:22,407
<i>Will surely drive me
to my grave<i>

10
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,413
<i>Wherever I go<i>

11
00:02:28,415 --> 00:02:31,917
<i>Trouble seem to follow<i>

12
00:02:34,854 --> 00:02:36,955
<i>Wherever I go<i>

13
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:41,059
<i>Trouble seem to follow<i>

14
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:58,977
Shit.

15
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:08,620
What's going on?

16
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:10,155
I don't know, man.

17
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:12,558
Think it just died.

18
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:16,428
Holy shit.

19
00:03:22,135 --> 00:03:24,036
Come on.

20
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,574
Oh, my God.

21
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:29,942
What is it?

22
00:03:29,944 --> 00:03:32,878
It's like angel-hair pasta
in here, brother.

23
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,384
Um...

24
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:40,852
here. Try it now.

25
00:03:54,468 --> 00:03:55,567
Anything?

26
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,035
Nothing.

27
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,282
Okay.

28
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:11,717
Oh, this is terrible.

29
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,785
All right.

30
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:17,356
So...

31
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,925
Um...

32
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,664
Why do we even bother
to pop the hood?

33
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,132
I thought
I heard something.

34
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:29,001
Yeah, well, unless there's
a flashing neon sign

35
00:04:29,003 --> 00:04:30,402
that says,
"Here's your problem,"

36
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:31,803
what the hell
do we know?

37
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:33,272
Fuck, that's hot.

38
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:34,473
Careful.

39
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,177
What you got?

40
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:41,713
I got no service.
What about you?

41
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:44,483
I hardly get
service in the city,

42
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:45,917
let alone the desert.

43
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,887
Yeah,
I got nothing, man.

44
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:51,623
Where the hell
are we, anyway?

45
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:52,658
Uh...

46
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,426
let me see.

47
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,363
Okay.

48
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:05,637
We, um--
We passed this dot...

49
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,339
about an hour ago.

50
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:08,907
I think we're
in here someplace.

51
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:10,409
That's like
60 miles back.

52
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:12,844
Wow.
It's like a hundred miles to the next dot.

53
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:15,547
What the hell are you doing driving
us through the middle of nowhere?

54
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:17,616
We're taking the scenic route,
remember?

55
00:05:17,618 --> 00:05:19,418
Yeah, by scenic,
I was thinking--

56
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,120
I don't know, more trees,
mountains, people,

57
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:23,922
dots a lot closer
together.

58
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:26,892
By scenic,
I meant rarely seen.

59
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:30,562
I'm gonna get you
a dictionary when we get back.

60
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:31,730
Okay.

61
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:35,300
Holy shit,
it's hot out here, man.

62
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:37,602
It's gotta be,
like, 115 degrees.

63
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:40,572
I know.

64
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:41,573
Not even noon!

65
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:42,808
No wonder
the truck died.

66
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,543
Something
probably melted.

67
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,180
Have we even
seen any cars?

68
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:49,114
Ow. No,

69
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:50,882
but, uh,
it's a road, right?

70
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,884
I mean, someone'll
be along soon.

71
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:55,654
Well, we got about
20 jelly beans

72
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:57,022
and 6 ounces
of melted ice.

73
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,623
That should last us
10 minutes.

74
00:05:58,625 --> 00:05:59,624
Oh, good.

75
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:01,960
It's pretty.

76
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:03,362
Yeah.
It's beautiful.

77
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:04,363
Ohh!

78
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,332
Ohh!

79
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,769
What flavor is this?

80
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:11,770
Bacon and margarita.

81
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:12,838
Oh, my God!

82
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,873
I saved those two
just for you.

83
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,478
Tastes like that cake
you made with the onions.

84
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,879
Remember that shit?

85
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:23,648
Yeah, I remember.

86
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,450
I think that
brings your total

87
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:28,186
of veiled references
to things I did with Karen

88
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:31,189
up to three,
so feel free to stop, please.

89
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:33,925
You never think about her,
man? Ever?

90
00:06:33,927 --> 00:06:36,428
I probably
think about her

91
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,497
about as much
as she thinks about me.

92
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:40,932
Well, she thinks
about you a lot, dude.

93
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:43,001
I ran into her
last week, and, uh,

94
00:06:43,003 --> 00:06:44,803
you were all
she can talk about.

95
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:48,106
She said she was floored
to hear you had a wife and kid.

96
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:49,775
Yeah, well, it floors me
sometimes, too.

97
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:52,778
You all right?

98
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,812
Yeah.

99
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:55,180
Don't overexert
yourself.

100
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:57,249
I can't believe
you got us out of roaming.

101
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:58,350
Huh?

102
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:00,318
Never been out of roaming.
That even possible?

103
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,254
Where are you going?
What are you doing?

104
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:04,956
I'm gonna go up here and
see if I can get a signal.

105
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,591
No! Let's sit,
and let's wait

106
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:07,793
a few minutes, man.

107
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:08,794
Well, why?

108
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:10,228
I don't know.

109
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,564
We'll hang, and we'll wait
for a car.

110
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:13,665
No, you sit and wait.

111
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,033
I'm gonna go up and check.

112
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,471
Ah, shit.

113
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,247
You remember last time
we drove cross-country

114
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:32,217
and we went, like,
200 miles out of the way

115
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:34,786
because we were
so into whatever we were talking about?

116
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:38,123
Yeah, and now neither one of us can
remember what it was.

117
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,691
Might have been when, uh--

118
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:43,562
Might have been when
you claimed that art can reach a point

119
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:46,164
where its quality
became fact rather than opinion.

120
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,733
That sounds
like a couple hours of my life

121
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,901
I'd like to have back.

122
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:52,103
Or it might have been
better defense,

123
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:53,839
'85 Bears
or Steel Curtain?

124
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:55,407
Ah, that's
hardly debatable.

125
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:57,042
Bears.
Yeah.

126
00:07:57,044 --> 00:08:00,045
Well, there hasn't been
much of that this time.

127
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:01,146
What?
Pointless conversation?

128
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,614
Any conversation.

129
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,717
How are things
in high finance?

130
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:07,519
Ah, put it
this way--

131
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:10,722
there's this
motivational poster in my office

132
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:13,024
with, like,
this eagle

133
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,626
soaring out
of the sky and shit.

134
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:15,694
Yeah.

135
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:17,462
I'll spend some days
just staring at it,

136
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:19,064
trying to decide
whether or not

137
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:20,832
I'm more suicidal or
homicidal that day.

138
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:21,967
Nice!

139
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:23,535
So quit.

140
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:26,471
Quit? And do what?

141
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:30,308
You ever do that thing when you
were in second grade,

142
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,010
where you,
like, drew a picture

143
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:35,747
of--of what you wanted
to be when you were adult, you know?

144
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:41,419
Like, I heard that that's
the truest reflection of what you really want.

145
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:44,422
Like, if you're doing
what you drew back then,

146
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:46,091
then you're probably
really happy.

147
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:47,792
Yeah? And what'd
you draw?

148
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:48,994
Me?

149
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:51,062
I think I drew
a fat, unemployed writer,

150
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:52,097
so I'm killing it.

151
00:09:03,442 --> 00:09:05,110
Come on.

152
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:08,413
Nothing.

153
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,095
So Joanne didn't like
your music, huh?

154
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:26,731
We just have
different tastes.

155
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:29,668
More likely,
she has taste.

156
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,003
Well, I liked it.

157
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:33,004
Karen liked it.

158
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:34,272
Would you stop that?

159
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:35,373
What, man?
I mean--

160
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,575
Joanne didn't
like your music,

161
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,443
and she made you
get rid of your guitars.

162
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:40,312
I'm just trying
to get up to speed here.

163
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:41,846
No, she didn't
make me do anything.

164
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:43,014
It became clear
that I wasn't

165
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:44,516
gonna have a lot
of chances to play,

166
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:46,051
so I got rid
of the stuff.

167
00:09:46,053 --> 00:09:47,819
You know, she's not
a music critic.

168
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:48,920
She's a receptionist.

169
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,855
She's my wife,
Carter, my wife.

170
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:52,023
I'm just saying.

171
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:53,592
I know exactly
what you're saying,

172
00:09:53,594 --> 00:09:55,226
and I'm telling you
to stop.

173
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,001
Davey said he saw
you guys at the store,

174
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:05,870
but you just kind of
walked right on by.

175
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:07,439
Yeah? Well,
tell him I say hello.

176
00:10:07,441 --> 00:10:08,940
Why don't
you tell him?

177
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,376
You live less than, like, 10 miles
away from the guy.

178
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:12,577
Yeah, we're pretty busy.

179
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:15,480
Well, he thinks that
your wife hates him.

180
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:16,715
No.
No?

181
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:18,917
She's just not much
on gatherings, that's all.

182
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,318
What about
your parents' house?

183
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,220
There's never less than
a hundred people there.

184
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:24,022
Ah, we don't
visit very often.

185
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:25,156
Okay.

186
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:27,626
Uh, so no Davey,
no family.

187
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,461
Sounds like the list
of people she does like

188
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,429
is kind of short.
I hope you're on it, buddy.

189
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:32,764
Seriously,
would you knock it off?

190
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:35,200
You don't even know her.

191
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:36,735
You're right, man.
I don't know her.

192
00:10:36,737 --> 00:10:39,204
Every time I come
to visit you guys, you're too busy.

193
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:42,107
I'm surprised she
let you get away to do this thing with me.

194
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:43,642
Here we go! Here we go!

195
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:46,211
Oh, thank God.
Come on. Here we go.

196
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:47,679
Whoa. Wait a minute.

197
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:48,947
Oh, shit. Wait. Wait.

198
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:50,215
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

199
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:51,816
God damn it!

200
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,785
Agh! Ow!

201
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:56,054
God damn it!

202
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:57,155
Dude, are you okay?

203
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,157
Hold up!

204
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,026
Hold on!

205
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:03,161
Shit!
Hold on!

206
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,563
Wait. Wait!

207
00:11:05,565 --> 00:11:07,632
Hey! Wait!

208
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:08,633
Hey!

209
00:11:08,635 --> 00:11:09,968
Hold on!

210
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:10,969
Hey!

211
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:12,170
Yo.

212
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:15,740
Whoa. Whoa.

213
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,045
Hey.
Car trouble?

214
00:11:20,047 --> 00:11:21,212
Yeah. We, uh--

215
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:23,314
We broke down
a few minutes ago.

216
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:25,316
Well, I-I'm not
much good on cars.

217
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:26,785
I'll give you
a lift into town.

218
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:28,486
That would be great.
Thank you so much.

219
00:11:28,488 --> 00:11:30,088
Just let me grab my bag.

220
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,656
Hey! Look, a ride.
Wait! Wait!

221
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:32,590
Sorry.

222
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:33,758
Hold on.
We don't need it.

223
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,627
What do you mean
we don't need it?

224
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:36,428
Sorry, sir.

225
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,629
Nothing
to worry about, son.

226
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:39,064
I-I'm harmless.
No, it's not--

227
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:41,733
No.
I, uh--

228
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:42,834
No, it's all right.

229
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:44,936
It's not that.
It's just that the--

230
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:47,806
The truck,
it's not broken.

231
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:50,041
What do you mean
it's not broken?

232
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,242
It's--
I took a wire out.

233
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:52,377
It's not a big deal.

234
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,712
What are you talk--
Um...

235
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:55,847
One second.

236
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,182
What are you
talking about?

237
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:59,384
I thought that we
were gonna have some good conversations

238
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:00,752
like the last time,
you know?

239
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:03,221
But instead I got
cellphones and freeways

240
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,723
and motels and
fucking sports radio.

241
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:08,126
And, uh, I mean,
I tried to get off the beaten path.

242
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:09,594
You just decided
to go to sleep,

243
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:12,330
so I thought this would give us
a chance to catch up.

244
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:13,331
Thank you, sir.

245
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,799
Are you out
of your f--

246
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,501
You sure everything's all right?
Yes. Oh, yeah.

247
00:12:16,503 --> 00:12:19,771
I--I am
definitely sure.

248
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:21,005
Okay.

249
00:12:21,007 --> 00:12:22,540
Ta-da.
All right, thank you.

250
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:24,309
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait. Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

251
00:12:24,311 --> 00:12:25,310
Put it in.

252
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:26,544
It's no big deal,
man.

253
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:28,880
Put it in!
I want to see it start.

254
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:31,116
It's just a wire.

255
00:12:31,118 --> 00:12:32,350
Sorry about this.

256
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,385
Just give us a second.

257
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:38,656
It's just a wire, man.

258
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:39,891
Look.
Okay.

259
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,294
Here.

260
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:05,216
Happy?

261
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:06,217
You boys good?

262
00:13:06,219 --> 00:13:07,218
Yeah. Yeah.

263
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,053
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

264
00:13:09,055 --> 00:13:11,156
I appreciate it.
Have a good day.

265
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:14,626
Sorry.
Thank you for stopping.

266
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:20,732
Are you insane?!

267
00:13:21,767 --> 00:13:22,600
Huh?

268
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:23,968
You stage
a breakdown

269
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,136
in the middle
of the desert

270
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,838
so that
we can talk?

271
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,207
Yeah, and we've had
our longest conversation in the whole trip.

272
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:30,775
I guess that's
a coincidence.

273
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:32,811
I could have broken
my neck falling down that goddamn hill.

274
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,946
I told you not go up there.
We could have had

275
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:36,614
a perfectly good talk sitting right here...
Talk?!

276
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:38,983
but you had to go up and
climb a fricking mountain.

277
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,451
That was not a talk.

278
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:42,487
That was you stopping us
a hundred miles from nowhere

279
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,355
so that you could spend a few
uninterrupted minutes

280
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:46,958
bashing my wife and job!

281
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,633
What kind
of a ring was it?

282
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:56,734
What?

283
00:13:56,736 --> 00:13:59,204
The engagement ring.
What kind was it?

284
00:13:59,206 --> 00:14:01,039
What do you mean,
what kind?

285
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,240
Was it a diamond?

286
00:14:02,242 --> 00:14:03,508
Why does that matter?

287
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,742
Why won't you answer?

288
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:07,145
Fine. I got her a diamond.
So what?

289
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:08,646
"So what?"
So you just forgot

290
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:10,148
all about
the gumball doctrine?

291
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,282
The gumball doc--

292
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:13,585
Oh, my God.
You gotta be kidding me.

293
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:16,521
Has nothing happened to you
in the last 10 years?

294
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,755
So you do remember?

295
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:19,524
Yeah, I remember it
as something cooked up

296
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,727
by a couple of losers
who had nothing better to do on a Friday night.

297
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,229
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
I didn't cook it up.

298
00:14:24,231 --> 00:14:26,898
You did. You're the one.
You're the one that said

299
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,867
that you would never
buy an engagement ring

300
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,668
that didn't come
from a gumball machine.

301
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,238
You're the one that said
the poorest people on the planet

302
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,772
are hacking off
each others' limbs

303
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:37,175
to give you something
to spend 2 months' salary on.

304
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:39,344
Look, just because you took
some conversation we had

305
00:14:39,346 --> 00:14:42,080
over beer and macaroni
and decided to make it your religion

306
00:14:42,082 --> 00:14:44,649
doesn't mean the rest
of the world gives a shit.

307
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:46,818
Okay, fine. So you
gave up on diamonds.

308
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,820
Okay. Who gives
a shit, man?

309
00:14:48,822 --> 00:14:52,824
You give up on
your music, your friends and your family,

310
00:14:52,826 --> 00:14:54,759
and for what,
the rebound girl?

311
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:56,294
Come on.
The rebound girl?

312
00:14:56,296 --> 00:14:57,295
Yes.
Really?

313
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:59,297
Yes, the rebound girl.

314
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:00,331
I was there.

315
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,833
I saw you
and Karen together.

316
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:03,601
You were insane
for the girl.

317
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,570
And--And when
she left, you know--

318
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:08,373
You were messed up.
Okay? People get that.

319
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:11,576
But 4 months later,
and you're engaged to the secretary?

320
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13,144
Listen,
take a step back,

321
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:14,746
and see that
for what it is.

322
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:16,714
I fell in love.
You panicked.

323
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:18,016
Why do you insist
on listening

324
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:19,717
to the words you're
putting into my mouth

325
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:21,920
rather than the ones
I'm actually saying?

326
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:23,388
You got a goddamn dog.

327
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,822
So what?
You're allergic!

328
00:15:24,824 --> 00:15:26,324
Take a pill.

329
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:27,458
What's the dog's name?

330
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,060
Sun--Fuck you.

331
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:30,061
No.

332
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:31,162
No, "Fuck You"--

333
00:15:31,164 --> 00:15:32,630
No, "Fuck You,"
I would believe.

334
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:34,532
"Fuck You" is exactly
the kind of name

335
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:35,867
that you
would name a dog.

336
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:39,804
No, but your dog's name
is Sunshine.

337
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:42,173
Fucking Sunshine.

338
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:44,676
Are you gonna
look at me with a straight face

339
00:15:44,678 --> 00:15:46,878
and tell me that
your opinion was actually considered

340
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,147
in the decision
that resulted in an animal

341
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:51,816
you're allergic to
being named after a Care Bear?

342
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:54,052
Oh, my God, you're right.
I didn't get to name the dog.

343
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:55,119
My life is a sham.

344
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,188
No, no, let me just get
this straight, okay?

345
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,323
J-Just for me.

346
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:00,391
So the love
of your life leaves.

347
00:16:00,393 --> 00:16:02,961
Okay? And, um,
less than a year later,

348
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:05,063
you're married
to a secretary

349
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:08,299
who loves dogs and hates
your fucking music.

350
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:11,102
I think it's reasonable
at that point to have some doubts, right?

351
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:14,639
I think it's reasonable
to email your good friend Carter.

352
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:15,640
You remember that?

353
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:16,941
"Hey,
what the fuck, man?

354
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:19,911
What am I getting into?
Did I make a mistake?"

355
00:16:19,913 --> 00:16:22,914
And before
I can hit reply, you buy a fucking house!

356
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:25,183
That's great!
I understand.

357
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:26,451
Right. Okay, fine.
You're--

358
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:27,719
Focus on--

359
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:29,253
You want to focus on
fucking square footage,

360
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:31,489
rather than the fact
that you have nothing in common.

361
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,657
That's okay. You--

362
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:34,392
It's marriage counseling
by HGTV.

363
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:36,661
I get it, man.
I get it.

364
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:39,297
And now, you know,
after all this home improvement,

365
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:40,498
you realize, you know,

366
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,467
you haven't improved
a goddamn thing.

367
00:16:42,469 --> 00:16:44,302
And now you got
no distractions.

368
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:45,970
"What am I gonna do?"

369
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:47,305
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

370
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:50,508
It's the next chapter
in the off-the-shelf life plan

371
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,976
you got
from Home Depot!

372
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:54,045
Right. Procreate!

373
00:16:54,047 --> 00:16:56,514
That's the job
that's never finished.

374
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:57,815
"Keep my face down.

375
00:16:57,817 --> 00:16:59,684
Keep my nose
to the grindstone."

376
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,052
Just focused
on the kid,

377
00:17:01,054 --> 00:17:03,688
and maybe you can go
the rest of your life

378
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,391
ignoring the fact
that you fucked up, man.

379
00:17:06,393 --> 00:17:08,292
You made
a colossal mistake,

380
00:17:08,294 --> 00:17:09,394
and you married,
literally,

381
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:11,029
the first chick
to come along.

382
00:17:11,031 --> 00:17:13,164
What--Hey, hey.
Come on. Come on. Fucking--

383
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,533
I'm not saying anything
you don't know already.

384
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:18,669
Just swallow your pride,
and you'll see how true it is.

385
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:20,271
You ever talk
about my family like that again,

386
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:22,607
I will kick the shit out of you.
You hear me?

387
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:23,808
Okay. All right.

388
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,811
Listen, I'm sure
that Cole is great.

389
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:29,881
I'm sure he's the best thing
to ever happen to you,

390
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:33,084
but he's not a substitute
for loving your wife.

391
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:35,486
Joanne was right.

392
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:37,955
You're nothing
but a piece of shit.

393
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:42,360
Okay.

394
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:43,428
That's okay.
Get in!

395
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,862
I'll get in when I'm--

396
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:46,731
I'll get in when I'm
good and fucking ready.

397
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,199
That's when
I'll get in.

398
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:53,671
So it's you and Joanne
against the whole world.

399
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:55,006
That's all right.
That's okay.

400
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:56,407
You know,
you're so scared

401
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,042
to admit that you
made a mistake,

402
00:17:58,044 --> 00:18:00,745
that you just keep on
making it over and over and over again.

403
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,246
But that's fine.
That's fine.

404
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:05,450
You want to keep on believing
your own bullshit,

405
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:06,717
we'll get you home,

406
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,454
get you back to your
perfect little life

407
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:10,922
and your
"motivational posters,"

408
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:13,024
and you
can tune back out and--

409
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:15,159
and try to forget
all about the fact

410
00:18:15,161 --> 00:18:17,295
that your life is
a complete shit hole.

411
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:20,098
Then maybe,
maybe you can call me in 20 years

412
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,866
when you've
fucking lost your hair

413
00:18:21,868 --> 00:18:24,235
and you've come
to your senses.

414
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:27,371
I don't think we'll be
talking much anymore.

415
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:28,673
Whatever.

416
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:38,483
Stupid motherfucker.

417
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:40,318
It probably just
came loose, man.

418
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,319
Are you insane!

419
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:42,320
Calm down!

420
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:43,354
Why are you--Calm down?

421
00:18:43,356 --> 00:18:44,789
You want me
to calm down?!

422
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,724
You go fucking around with
the electrical system

423
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:48,259
in a 30-year-old
piece-of-shit truck

424
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:51,028
in the middle of the desert
with no food and no water,

425
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,597
and I'm supposed
to calm down!

426
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:54,632
I didn't fuck around with it.
I disabled it, briefly.

427
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,001
You should be thankful
that I'm willing to go to these...

428
00:18:57,003 --> 00:18:58,002
Thankful!
I should be thankful?!

429
00:18:58,004 --> 00:18:59,370
lengths to try
to help you.

430
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:00,771
Who the fuck are you

431
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:03,841
to be giving me some sort
of life intervention, huh?

432
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:05,143
You're unemployed!

433
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:05,943
You're homeless!

434
00:19:05,945 --> 00:19:07,645
Yes, and you
hate your job,

435
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,915
and you have a house
that's apparently too small for a guitar!

436
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:13,351
This is so typical.
This is so typical.

437
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:15,353
You're constantly
doing something for you

438
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:17,655
and then saying that
it's for everybody else.

439
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:18,990
You don't like my wife,

440
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:20,525
we don't get
to hang out anymore,

441
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:21,859
so you want me
to get divorced,

442
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:22,960
right,
for my own good...

443
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:24,328
Yeah.
because I can do better,

444
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,663
but it's all bullshit.

445
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,532
You want me
to find somebody you like better.

446
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:29,000
It's for your own good.

447
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:30,134
Fuck. Fuck. Shit.

448
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:32,003
I got a good job.
I make good money.

449
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,005
I have a house, a family,
and it kills you,

450
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:36,007
because you're
a 30-year-old failure who lives in his car.

451
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:37,775
Right.
So you turn your anger on everybody else

452
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:40,678
and try to make us feel
like our achievements aren't worth a shit

453
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,946
because we
didn't draw a picture

454
00:19:41,948 --> 00:19:44,015
of ourselves doing them
in the second grade.

455
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,683
You actually
think that if I quit,

456
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,018
took up music
and actually made it,

457
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,386
that you'd be
happy for me?

458
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:49,720
Mm.
Fuck that. You would be

459
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:51,856
just as blind with jealousy
then as you are now.

460
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,057
You'd probably--
I don't know--

461
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,825
run me over with
your car-slash-house...

462
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:56,093
Probably.
and then tell me

463
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:58,262
that it was for
my own good, right?

464
00:19:58,264 --> 00:19:59,263
Yeah.

465
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:00,798
This is not about me.

466
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,333
You don't give a shit
about me.

467
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:03,601
This is all about you

468
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:05,503
and how everybody else
can accommodate your failure.

469
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:08,105
Hey, I'm not
a failure, okay?

470
00:20:08,107 --> 00:20:10,608
I could have everything
you have and more,

471
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:14,212
but I decided long ago
that it would be better to follow my dream

472
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:17,315
rather than try to buy enough shit
from fucking Pottery Barn

473
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:19,850
to be comfortable
with the idea of being

474
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:23,821
a meaningless,
lever-pulling, button-pushing cog!

475
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:25,823
I was a day away from--

476
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:27,291
From law school.
No, no.

477
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:28,526
We all know
the story.

478
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:30,027
Fuck!

479
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:32,730
You took a test.
You blew it away.

480
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,198
You had your choice
of schools,

481
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,801
but walked away
for the sake of art, right? Right?

482
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:38,936
I followed my dream
instead of a paycheck.

483
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:40,838
Yeah. No, no, no,
no, no. Enh! wrong.

484
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,707
You're a scared and
insecure little freak

485
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:44,308
who couldn't get
anywhere with writing

486
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,944
and so desperately
needed somebody to approve of you,

487
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:48,913
to say that you were
still intelligent,

488
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:49,947
still capable...
Come on.

489
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:51,482
that you took
a fricking test.

490
00:20:51,484 --> 00:20:52,950
You know
what you should do?

491
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:54,685
You should tattoo
that test score on your forehead.

492
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:57,588
That way, when somebody says, "Wait a second.
You live in your car?"

493
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,889
You can say,
"Yeah, but look.

494
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:02,426
I chose to be a loser,
so its okay."

495
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,963
You think you've
got the rest of us pegged, right?

496
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:07,498
You got the rest
of us pegged,

497
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,867
and it's your job
to make sure we all face reality?

498
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:11,535
The reality is
your writing sucks.

499
00:21:11,537 --> 00:21:13,904
You're not gonna be famous.
You're not gonna sell a book.

500
00:21:13,906 --> 00:21:15,306
You are wasting
your time.

501
00:21:15,308 --> 00:21:17,174
You're the one that needs
to face facts, pal.

502
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:18,876
But every time
those facts get too close,

503
00:21:18,878 --> 00:21:20,878
you just hop in your car,
and you run off.

504
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,046
Well,
here are the facts.

505
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,614
A 30-year-old loser
living in his car

506
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,983
is about the last
person that I'm gonna be looking to

507
00:21:25,985 --> 00:21:27,485
for advice
on how to fix my life.

508
00:21:27,487 --> 00:21:29,854
So unless you want to put out
a book of don'ts

509
00:21:29,856 --> 00:21:31,422
based on all the ways
you screwed up,

510
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:33,424
which is the only thing
you're ever likely to publish,

511
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:35,359
you should probably
just shut the fuck up.

512
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:40,464
Are you done?

513
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:51,475
Fuck!

514
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,422
Shit. Shit.

515
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,443
Shit. Sh...

516
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,460
Someone'll come along.

517
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,130
You make me sick.

518
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:04,335
Hot enough for ya?

519
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:12,476
They say the nights
kill more people than the days.

520
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:16,680
Okay.

521
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:20,551
I'm so thirsty.

522
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:22,486
My tongue feels
like a two-by-four.

523
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:24,788
Here.

524
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,066
Eh...

525
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,781
Man, finish it.

526
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,555
How long can you go
without water?

527
00:25:57,557 --> 00:25:59,056
2 days?

528
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:00,457
I don't know.
It doesn't matter.

529
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:01,926
I'm going for help
in the morning.

530
00:26:01,928 --> 00:26:05,095
Oh, 60 miles is
a pretty long walk.

531
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:08,265
That's only if
I don't see a car.

532
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:11,068
I think I saw some cones
on the way in, man.

533
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,503
I don't know.

534
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:18,008
Hey, I know it--

535
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:22,079
I know it doesn't really change
anything, but, uh...

536
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,547
I'm sorry.

537
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:29,119
It was definitely
not your brightest idea.

538
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:31,622
I mean I'm sorry
about what I said.

539
00:26:32,691 --> 00:26:34,758
Are you sure you
don't want to apologize

540
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,293
for getting us stuck?

541
00:26:36,295 --> 00:26:39,129
I'm not freezing to death
because you insulted my wife.

542
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,733
I'm sorry about
the whole goddamn thing.

543
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:49,006
You really think
my writing sucks?

544
00:26:49,008 --> 00:26:50,841
It's--It's not bad.

545
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:52,309
It's just...

546
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:57,214
all--all your characters
get, like, cancer and die.

547
00:26:57,216 --> 00:26:58,716
Don't all get cancer
and die.

548
00:26:58,718 --> 00:27:00,217
In that one thing,
I'm pretty sure

549
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:01,385
about 75%
of the people die--

550
00:27:01,387 --> 00:27:04,021
That was about
an oncologist.

551
00:27:04,023 --> 00:27:05,522
Yeah, and that other one
with the woman

552
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:07,524
who was high and her baby
crawled out the window.

553
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:09,493
I mean, it was
good writing, but...

554
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:11,328
kind made me
want to kill myself.

555
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:14,198
Look, that shit really
happens, all right?

556
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:19,136
It's just hard to get the message out
if nobody reads the book.

557
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:21,872
The idea that
"I might not have it,"

558
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:24,508
it's--it's not news.

559
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:27,144
It's just that...

560
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:29,847
you go your whole life
with everyone

561
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:33,617
yelling at you to follow your dream and
then to never give up.

562
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:36,453
But to be honest,
if everyone followed their dreams,

563
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:39,189
we'd just be a planet
of pro athletes and--

564
00:27:39,191 --> 00:27:40,524
and astronauts.

565
00:27:41,627 --> 00:27:43,994
You know, there's gotta
be someone there

566
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:46,196
to clean the toilets,
am I right?

567
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:47,831
It's like you said,
you know.

568
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:50,701
Sometimes it's better to go after
something you care about

569
00:27:50,703 --> 00:27:53,470
than to be handed something
that you don't, right?

570
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,405
Really?

571
00:27:54,407 --> 00:27:56,140
What if
my lifelong dream

572
00:27:56,142 --> 00:27:58,142
was to be point guard
for the Lakers?

573
00:27:58,144 --> 00:28:00,411
Would you tell me
to keep chasing that?

574
00:28:00,413 --> 00:28:01,679
No.

575
00:28:01,681 --> 00:28:03,247
Exactly.

576
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:04,448
Because "Never give up"

577
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,450
looks a hell
of a lot better

578
00:28:06,452 --> 00:28:08,786
on a coffee mug than
it does in real life.

579
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:10,821
Because failing...

580
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:16,360
daily failing,
it's--it's just--

581
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:19,129
it's a lonely...

582
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:21,031
miserable business.

583
00:28:22,601 --> 00:28:26,804
Look man, if I thought you should quit,
I would say so.

584
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:33,143
But sometimes, you know,
inside all that other stuff,

585
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:34,545
sometimes...

586
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:37,247
you'll say something
in just a few words

587
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:39,416
that I realize I've
been thinking for years.

588
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:41,585
And that's not just
you reading my mind.

589
00:28:41,587 --> 00:28:43,487
That's you
reading a part of it

590
00:28:43,489 --> 00:28:45,923
that I never would have
known how to express.

591
00:28:45,925 --> 00:28:49,226
Now, that's not
just some fat kid with no jump shot.

592
00:28:49,228 --> 00:28:50,227
That's--

593
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,463
There's something there.

594
00:28:52,465 --> 00:28:55,766
Some of the things
you put out there, man...

595
00:28:56,968 --> 00:29:00,471
I think a lot more of them
stick than you realize.

596
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,614
I cheated on Joanne.

597
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,184
Are you kidding me?

598
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:15,786
No.

599
00:29:15,788 --> 00:29:18,255
6 months ago
at this conference.

600
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:20,891
Just--

601
00:29:20,893 --> 00:29:22,593
just sort of happened.

602
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:26,396
We're freezing our asses
off in the middle of the desert.

603
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:27,931
You think you're
gonna get away with,

604
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:28,932
"It just
sort of happened?"

605
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,835
It was just--

606
00:29:31,837 --> 00:29:33,403
It was this woman--

607
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:35,239
Girl, really, 21, 22,

608
00:29:35,241 --> 00:29:36,840
somebody's intern.

609
00:29:37,843 --> 00:29:40,077
Long brown hair,
these long, skinny legs,

610
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:42,713
and she had
this huge smile.

611
00:29:42,715 --> 00:29:44,882
And she walks up to me,
and she introduces herself,

612
00:29:44,884 --> 00:29:48,051
asks what firm I'm with, blah, blah, blah.
And I said, like,

613
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:51,555
"Listen, if--if you're looking for a job,
I'm the wrong guy,"

614
00:29:51,557 --> 00:29:54,992
and she goes,
"No, I just think you look interesting."

615
00:29:54,994 --> 00:29:57,294
And she says, "Would you
like to have dinner?"

616
00:29:57,296 --> 00:30:00,864
And I realize that
I've had my hands in my pockets this whole time,

617
00:30:00,866 --> 00:30:03,267
so she has no idea
that I'm even married.

618
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:04,501
Mm-hmm.

619
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:06,003
And suddenly I get
this feeling, you know,

620
00:30:06,005 --> 00:30:08,338
like I told you I get
with books and movies,

621
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,274
like I--I finally had
a chance to escape,

622
00:30:10,276 --> 00:30:12,109
to be somebody else
for a while.

623
00:30:12,111 --> 00:30:14,545
So I go back up to my room,

624
00:30:14,547 --> 00:30:17,481
and suddenly I feel
this wave of guilt,

625
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:19,383
like the spell breaks,

626
00:30:19,385 --> 00:30:21,185
and I start thinking
this is crazy.

627
00:30:21,187 --> 00:30:22,619
Then all of a sudden,

628
00:30:22,621 --> 00:30:25,389
my phone rings,
and it's Joanne.

629
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:27,791
And I answer, and I say,

630
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:30,694
"I'm so glad you called,"
because I was.

631
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:33,530
"I miss you, and I wish
you were here right now."

632
00:30:33,532 --> 00:30:35,933
And she says, "Well, I wish
I were there right now, too,

633
00:30:35,935 --> 00:30:37,267
"because the disposal's
broken again.

634
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:38,535
"Do you want me
to call a repairman,

635
00:30:38,537 --> 00:30:39,937
"or do you want
to try and fix it?

636
00:30:39,939 --> 00:30:41,972
"Oh, and did you ever
talk to our neighbor

637
00:30:41,974 --> 00:30:44,141
"about whether or not
they stole our recycling bin?

638
00:30:44,143 --> 00:30:46,710
Because it's getting
a little awkward walking with--"

639
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:49,046
And she goes on like this
for, like, 5 minutes.

640
00:30:51,884 --> 00:30:55,652
So when I hung up,

641
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:57,721
I practically ran
to the elevator.

642
00:30:57,723 --> 00:30:59,957
And Annie--
her name was Annie--

643
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:01,625
we have this whole dinner,

644
00:31:01,627 --> 00:31:04,094
and you know
what we talked about?

645
00:31:04,096 --> 00:31:05,195
College football.

646
00:31:05,197 --> 00:31:07,130
Mm.
College football.

647
00:31:07,132 --> 00:31:08,932
No car insurance,
no day care,

648
00:31:08,934 --> 00:31:11,935
no gossip about other parents
I don't even know.

649
00:31:11,937 --> 00:31:14,638
Just simple, effortless conversation.
I've never--

650
00:31:16,741 --> 00:31:20,310
The first one that
I've had in a long time.

651
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:22,346
Scale of 1 to 10?

652
00:31:22,348 --> 00:31:23,380
10.

653
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:24,915
Plus the fact
that she was 21,

654
00:31:24,917 --> 00:31:26,283
makes her, like,
an eleventy-zillion.

655
00:31:26,285 --> 00:31:28,051
Hello.

656
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:29,386
Don't get me wrong.

657
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:32,356
Joanne is
very attractive.

658
00:31:32,358 --> 00:31:34,958
And this is gonna
sound shallow, but...

659
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:40,697
pregnancy is bad
for a body.

660
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:43,767
You know, sometimes
I'll catch myself

661
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:47,170
staring at her thighs
or belly,

662
00:31:47,172 --> 00:31:48,605
and I'll be like...

663
00:31:48,607 --> 00:31:51,808
whatever happened to the
woman I married, you know?

664
00:31:53,144 --> 00:31:56,213
You do realize you're
the one who made her like that.

665
00:31:56,215 --> 00:31:59,816
I know. That's why
I feel like an asshole even saying this.

666
00:31:59,818 --> 00:32:02,219
I feel like an asshole
even thinking it.

667
00:32:02,221 --> 00:32:03,654
And don't get me wrong.

668
00:32:03,656 --> 00:32:05,689
Cole is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

669
00:32:05,691 --> 00:32:07,224
It's just
he's the worst thing

670
00:32:07,226 --> 00:32:08,926
that ever happened
to our sex life.

671
00:32:08,928 --> 00:32:12,062
I used to look at Joanne
and just want to jump her,

672
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:15,332
but now I look at her,
and sometimes--

673
00:32:15,334 --> 00:32:17,901
And this is embarrassing,
but sometimes

674
00:32:17,903 --> 00:32:20,470
I have trouble...

675
00:32:20,472 --> 00:32:23,440
getting ready for her.

676
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,677
And Annie?

677
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:28,845
I could be ready
just thinking about her.

678
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:30,681
I was ready
when she asked my name.

679
00:32:30,683 --> 00:32:33,450
I guess
when you get married,

680
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:36,119
you're supposed to say
that the relationship

681
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:39,823
goes beyond tight thighs
and a skinny waist

682
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:41,258
and that,
when all that goes,

683
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,693
the rest of it
will sustain you.

684
00:32:42,695 --> 00:32:44,328
Well, it just
isn't phrased that way.

685
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:47,164
But if--if it was,
would you still have married her?

686
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:48,732
Yeah, of course, but...

687
00:32:48,734 --> 00:32:51,735
you just don't realize
how much you'll miss things,

688
00:32:51,737 --> 00:32:53,570
you know, little things,
like kissing.

689
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:55,472
Y-You don't
kiss Joanne anymore?

690
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:56,907
Yeah, we kiss
all the time,

691
00:32:56,909 --> 00:32:58,875
but it's habit.
It's like a handshake.

692
00:32:58,877 --> 00:33:00,510
You don't even
think about it.

693
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:01,712
But when Annie kissed me...

694
00:33:01,714 --> 00:33:03,213
fuck.

695
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:07,217
It was like the hairs on the back
of my neck stood up.

696
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:10,287
It's hard to say, but there's more in that
first kiss with someone new

697
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:12,723
than there is
in the whole shebang after 4 years.

698
00:33:12,725 --> 00:33:14,024
That's how everything was.

699
00:33:14,026 --> 00:33:15,959
It was just exciting,
you know, touching her,

700
00:33:15,961 --> 00:33:17,828
taking her clothes off
for the first time.

701
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:21,765
And then the--
the rest of the weekend at--at the conference,

702
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:24,001
I'd be sitting
in some stupid speech,

703
00:33:24,003 --> 00:33:27,371
and all I could
think about was those tiny, little legs

704
00:33:27,373 --> 00:33:28,739
and those little
black panties,

705
00:33:28,741 --> 00:33:31,942
and I just--I felt like
I was going fucking crazy.

706
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:34,911
So then, at lunch,
I found her...

707
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:39,383
and we blew off
the rest of the conference,

708
00:33:39,385 --> 00:33:41,351
just blew it off.

709
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,186
Did it 4 times
on Sunday...

710
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:46,923
once an hour before
we went to the airport.

711
00:33:46,925 --> 00:33:48,658
Now, you have
to understand,

712
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,461
if Joanne and I do it
four times a month,

713
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:53,096
it's a fucking miracle.

714
00:33:53,098 --> 00:33:56,666
But it's like I knew
that it was gonna disappear forever,

715
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:59,803
and I just--
I couldn't get enough.

716
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:01,805
And did it
disappear forever?

717
00:34:01,807 --> 00:34:05,008
Yeah, we email
sometimes, but...

718
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,676
nothing serious.

719
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:09,413
But every time I see
her name in my in-box,

720
00:34:09,415 --> 00:34:11,281
it's like my heart
doubles up, man.

721
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:12,916
Are you gonna
see her again?

722
00:34:12,918 --> 00:34:15,419
Why? That would just
ruin it, you know?

723
00:34:15,421 --> 00:34:18,822
Everything I felt for Annie,
I used to feel for Joanne.

724
00:34:18,824 --> 00:34:23,160
So, what, I just run off
with this gorgeous little football fan. Then what?

725
00:34:23,162 --> 00:34:26,797
Next thing you know,
talking to Annie is like talking to Joanne,

726
00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:29,266
kissing Annie is like
kissing Joanne. It's--

727
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:33,236
That's just
what marriage does.

728
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:40,143
You asked if I ever mention
the music to Joanne.

729
00:34:40,145 --> 00:34:41,144
Well, I have.

730
00:34:41,146 --> 00:34:42,579
Hmm.
I do.

731
00:34:42,581 --> 00:34:44,147
It's like clockwork.

732
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,784
Every couple of months,
I'll wake up,

733
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:50,754
freaked out that my life
is meaningless.

734
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:53,123
She'll try on some clothes,
have a breakdown,

735
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:56,026
swear she's gonna
lose 20 pounds, swears off food.

736
00:34:56,028 --> 00:35:00,163
I swear that I'm gonna turn in
my tie for a guitar strap.

737
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:02,432
We both say, "Good for you, honey.
I'm with you,"

738
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:06,670
not believing a single fucking word
the other person's saying.

739
00:35:06,672 --> 00:35:09,940
That's the problem
with marriage. You--

740
00:35:09,942 --> 00:35:12,309
You can't do it
without learning to lie

741
00:35:12,311 --> 00:35:15,245
to the one person
you're supposed to trust.

742
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:18,014
Can I ask you something?

743
00:35:18,016 --> 00:35:19,149
What?

744
00:35:19,151 --> 00:35:22,886
And I don't--I don't
mean to upset you.

745
00:35:22,888 --> 00:35:23,987
Um...

746
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:26,923
if it's so bad,
why don't you get out?

747
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:29,659
Let me see your keys.

748
00:35:29,661 --> 00:35:31,962
I told you, I tried
a million times.

749
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:33,063
Just--Just let me see 'em.

750
00:35:33,065 --> 00:35:34,364
It's not gonna work,
brother.

751
00:35:36,367 --> 00:35:37,934
That's it?

752
00:35:37,936 --> 00:35:39,970
Two keys?

753
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:41,138
Yeah, why?

754
00:35:45,743 --> 00:35:46,910
Jesus.
Yeah.

755
00:35:46,912 --> 00:35:48,645
It's like you
mugged a locksmith.

756
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:49,980
Yeah, I know. It's, uh--

757
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:52,282
Okay, there's my--
my house keys.

758
00:35:52,284 --> 00:35:53,817
I got my gym locker.

759
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:55,285
I've got my toolshed.

760
00:35:55,287 --> 00:35:57,487
I've got my boat keys.

761
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,456
I don't know what the hell
that one's for...

762
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:00,790
Jesus.
or that one.

763
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:02,659
I mean, it's like--
You know when people say

764
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:03,827
they're gonna
put down roots?

765
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:05,729
Well, that's what
it looks like.

766
00:36:10,468 --> 00:36:12,068
Shit.

767
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:17,007
You know what
I always wanted?

768
00:36:17,009 --> 00:36:18,275
What?

769
00:36:18,277 --> 00:36:20,377
Mohawk, fucking Mohawk,

770
00:36:20,379 --> 00:36:24,915
just like that dude
from--from "Taxi Driver."

771
00:36:24,917 --> 00:36:26,483
Travis Bickle?
The nutcase?

772
00:36:26,485 --> 00:36:27,484
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

773
00:36:27,486 --> 00:36:28,985
But I could never do it.

774
00:36:28,987 --> 00:36:30,086
Why not?

775
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:33,023
Well, because my parents
would have killed me.

776
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:34,858
Then when I got to college,
I was working.

777
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,160
Then I was working
as soon as I got out of college.

778
00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:39,496
Then of course I got married
and had a kid, so...

779
00:36:39,498 --> 00:36:41,064
So?

780
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:43,900
So you don't see
many responsible parents

781
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:47,737
or functioning members
of society with Mohawks.

782
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:50,207
So?

783
00:36:50,209 --> 00:36:52,075
So forget about doing

784
00:36:52,077 --> 00:36:53,810
something crazy
and life-altering

785
00:36:53,812 --> 00:36:56,279
like quitting my job
or leaving my wife.

786
00:36:56,281 --> 00:36:58,682
I can't even get
a haircut anymore

787
00:36:58,684 --> 00:37:00,083
without thinking
about the keys,

788
00:37:00,085 --> 00:37:02,385
and the keys,
they don't like Mohawks.

789
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:06,056
Well, how long do you have to listen
to the keys exactly?

790
00:37:06,058 --> 00:37:08,792
U-Until you retire?
Until Cole goes to college?

791
00:37:08,794 --> 00:37:11,294
Oh, I'll probably
be bald by then.

792
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,330
Exactly.

793
00:37:13,332 --> 00:37:17,834
You know, I used
to have something on my key chain,

794
00:37:17,836 --> 00:37:20,170
but it kept
falling off.

795
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:24,608
Do you know
what this is?

796
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,743
This is a multi-tool.

797
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:31,281
And do you know what
one of the tools is?

798
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:34,417
Shing.

799
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:35,452
Mohawk?

800
00:37:35,454 --> 00:37:37,721
Dude, put away
the multi-tool.

801
00:37:37,723 --> 00:37:38,722
It's not happening.

802
00:37:38,724 --> 00:37:39,956
Why not?

803
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:42,192
Because I just told you
two pounds of why.

804
00:37:42,194 --> 00:37:43,293
So what, man?
Nobody's here.

805
00:37:43,295 --> 00:37:44,494
We're freezing
our asses off

806
00:37:44,496 --> 00:37:45,595
in the middle
of the desert.

807
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:46,830
There's not a soul
to stop you.

808
00:37:46,832 --> 00:37:48,265
Whoa.
Mohawk!

809
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:50,533
It's not something that
I think Cole needs to see,

810
00:37:50,535 --> 00:37:51,968
is his old man
with a Mohawk.

811
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:53,703
So what? You'll--
Man, you'll--

812
00:37:53,705 --> 00:37:56,473
you'll prove to him
that--that it's good to be your own man.

813
00:37:56,475 --> 00:37:58,174
What about Joanne?

814
00:37:58,176 --> 00:38:00,744
Joanne's probably
as bored with you as you are of her.

815
00:38:00,746 --> 00:38:03,446
You're probably one Mohawk away from
fucking like rabbits.

816
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:04,447
Okay, well...

817
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:06,249
Mohawk! Mo--

818
00:38:06,251 --> 00:38:08,718
Come on.
Just say fuck it, man.

819
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,553
Fuck it. Fuck the keys.

820
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:12,022
Do it for you.

821
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,625
Oh, God, you don't--

822
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:17,360
You're
pulling on it.

823
00:38:17,362 --> 00:38:18,828
Just re--Just relax.

824
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,196
Don't be a pussy.

825
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:22,198
There we go.

826
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,701
Whee.

827
00:38:24,703 --> 00:38:26,169
That's looking good, man.

828
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:44,654
Here we go.

829
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:48,692
Ow!

830
00:38:48,694 --> 00:38:50,694
Yeah, that's gonna
leave a mark.

831
00:38:50,696 --> 00:38:52,195
Are you
fucking kidding me?

832
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:57,834
Is it straight?

833
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:59,336
It's fairly straight.

834
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:01,538
Yeah? Does it look
like Travis Bickle?

835
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,806
Heh. You look
pretty crazy.

836
00:39:05,876 --> 00:39:07,277
What do you think?
Oh, no.

837
00:39:07,279 --> 00:39:08,478
Do you love it?

838
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:11,881
Yes.

839
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:12,916
Oh, my God.

840
00:39:12,918 --> 00:39:14,217
I'll give you 100 bucks

841
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:16,586
if you let me come to work
with you on Monday.

842
00:39:16,588 --> 00:39:17,987
You don't have $100.

843
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:19,756
I know!
I'll sell something.

844
00:39:19,758 --> 00:39:21,391
You gonna sell a book?

845
00:39:21,393 --> 00:39:22,192
Something of value,

846
00:39:22,194 --> 00:39:25,228
like my kidney, maybe.
God.

847
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,764
Oh, my God.
This look is never gonna make it to work.

848
00:39:27,766 --> 00:39:30,200
Oh, come on, man.
This is new Mitch coming through.

849
00:39:30,202 --> 00:39:32,769
Oh, my--I can't
believe how many times you cut me.

850
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:33,970
The lacerations will fade,

851
00:39:33,972 --> 00:39:36,106
but the memories
will last us a lifetime.

852
00:39:36,108 --> 00:39:39,309
Oh, we can't say
nothing happened on this trip, huh?

853
00:39:39,311 --> 00:39:41,611
God.

854
00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:42,879
Yeah.

855
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:49,018
What?

856
00:39:52,656 --> 00:39:55,291
Have you ever
been this thirsty?

857
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:58,161
No.

858
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:09,672
Really?

859
00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:11,708
It tastes like water.

860
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:12,709
Gimme.

861
00:40:12,711 --> 00:40:14,177
Yeah, tastes like water.

862
00:40:19,251 --> 00:40:20,750
It's blue and soapy.

863
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,051
Yeah, well,
it's washer fluid.

864
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:23,553
What do you expect?

865
00:40:25,023 --> 00:40:27,257
That's horrible.

866
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:30,126
I don't...

867
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:34,497
I don't
want any more.

868
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:38,968
All right.

869
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:41,137
I don't like it.
Well...

870
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:43,740
I-I'm gonna save
mine for tomorrow,

871
00:40:43,742 --> 00:40:46,943
in case I have
to go for a walk.

872
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:51,948
Yeah, well,
we should pro--

873
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:54,684
We should probably
get some sleep...

874
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:57,220
Yeah.
in case you do, huh?

875
00:40:57,222 --> 00:40:59,322
Yeah.

876
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:55,478
Holy shit.

877
00:41:56,481 --> 00:41:58,948
Hold on. Hello.

878
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:00,583
Hello? Hi. Oh, God.

879
00:42:00,585 --> 00:42:02,752
Thank you. Wait.

880
00:42:02,754 --> 00:42:04,087
Hi. Hi.

881
00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:05,488
Hold on. Hi. Hi.

882
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:07,724
How--How are you?
It's so good to see you.

883
00:42:07,726 --> 00:42:09,158
We had--Ow.

884
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,160
Okay, don't
go anywhere.

885
00:42:11,162 --> 00:42:14,264
Um, we had a...

886
00:42:14,266 --> 00:42:16,699
problem last night.

887
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:19,302
It's so good to see you.
I'm sorry. Um,

888
00:42:19,304 --> 00:42:22,972
oh, my God.
We had a bit of an issue with the engine.

889
00:42:22,974 --> 00:42:25,041
I guess I tampered with it,

890
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:26,643
or--I didn't really
dismantle it.

891
00:42:26,645 --> 00:42:29,946
It's fine.
It's all good, but, uh,

892
00:42:29,948 --> 00:42:31,581
God, we were here
all night,

893
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:33,483
all day and
all night last night.

894
00:42:33,485 --> 00:42:35,585
Maybe you have food
or water or something?

895
00:42:35,587 --> 00:42:37,186
Just--Just anything?
A ride, you know?

896
00:42:37,188 --> 00:42:39,622
We--We'll...

897
00:42:39,624 --> 00:42:40,590
Wait! No!

898
00:42:40,592 --> 00:42:43,526
Where are you going?
Wait! Wait! Wait!

899
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,833
Oh, God.

900
00:42:50,835 --> 00:42:55,505
What the fuck
are you doing?!

901
00:42:57,541 --> 00:43:00,577
I--I thought she was
gonna take us with her.

902
00:43:00,579 --> 00:43:01,911
She was!

903
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:04,681
Until you scared
the shit out of her!

904
00:43:04,683 --> 00:43:07,884
You couldn't wait
one minute to get into the car, man?

905
00:43:07,886 --> 00:43:09,118
Come on!

906
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,219
I don't--I don't know.

907
00:43:10,221 --> 00:43:12,288
I thought she--
I thought that--

908
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:16,893
You look like a goddamn fucking
horror movie extra!

909
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:20,730
Let's remember
why I look like this.

910
00:43:20,732 --> 00:43:22,565
This--This was your idea!

911
00:43:22,567 --> 00:43:25,935
What am I afraid of?
What can it hurt? Well, there you go.

912
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:29,639
That is exactly why
you can't have a Mohawk in the real world.

913
00:43:29,641 --> 00:43:33,343
I gave you a haircut,
not a lobotomy.

914
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:36,479
I don't feel well.

915
00:43:36,481 --> 00:43:37,513
Ahh.

916
00:43:37,515 --> 00:43:39,549
Maybe it has something
to do with the fact

917
00:43:39,551 --> 00:43:42,418
that I spent a day
in the oven and the night in the freezer

918
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,320
with nothing
but fucking washer fluid in my system!

919
00:43:44,322 --> 00:43:46,356
I told you not to drink
that shit, man.

920
00:43:46,358 --> 00:43:47,390
Oh!
It tasted like soap!

921
00:43:47,392 --> 00:43:49,058
Okay, so this is
all my fault.

922
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:51,527
I got us stuck
in the desert.

923
00:43:51,529 --> 00:43:55,498
Well, you certainly
got us stuck for another 20 hours.

924
00:43:57,234 --> 00:43:58,968
Hey, do me a favor.

925
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,537
If you see
any more cars coming,

926
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:05,341
try not to be
such a fucking moron!

927
00:44:05,343 --> 00:44:06,843
This is exactly
what happens

928
00:44:06,845 --> 00:44:09,779
when you let a homeless person
cut your hair!

929
00:44:15,387 --> 00:44:17,553
Don't worry.
I'm gonna call Joanne for you.

930
00:44:17,555 --> 00:44:20,289
I'll tell her you're just fine,
you'll be home soon,

931
00:44:20,291 --> 00:44:22,458
but you won't be able
to get it up looking at

932
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,726
her fat fucking thighs...
Hey!

933
00:44:23,728 --> 00:44:25,962
unless you think about
your girlfriend Annie.

934
00:44:25,964 --> 00:44:27,697
Hey, You better keep
your mouth shut!

935
00:44:27,699 --> 00:44:29,632
Then maybe she'll give you

936
00:44:29,634 --> 00:44:32,235
that divorce you're
so scared to ask for.

937
00:44:32,237 --> 00:44:37,407
Then you can give
those keys you love so much to Cole's new dad!

938
00:44:37,409 --> 00:44:38,408
Hey!

939
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:41,678
You fucker.

940
00:44:44,648 --> 00:44:45,815
Aah!

941
00:44:45,817 --> 00:44:50,219
Oh, shit.

942
00:44:57,094 --> 00:44:58,261
Hey.

943
00:44:58,263 --> 00:44:59,862
You son of a bitch.

944
00:45:00,998 --> 00:45:02,198
Hey.

945
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,233
Come here.
Hey!

946
00:45:04,235 --> 00:45:05,868
Come here!
Hey! Hey!

947
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:14,243
You son of a--

948
00:45:17,615 --> 00:45:18,614
You--

949
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:22,585
You just broke my nose!

950
00:45:22,587 --> 00:45:23,586
Fucking--

951
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,456
Yaah!

952
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:28,725
Damn it.

953
00:45:28,727 --> 00:45:30,760
Hyah!

954
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:44,440
Come on!

955
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:48,077
Aah! Oh, my eye!
Time-out!

956
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,679
Are you all right?

957
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:54,417
Damn it!

958
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:12,268
I think you broke my nose.

959
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:17,874
Now I'm going
to have two casts

960
00:46:17,876 --> 00:46:19,809
and a fucking Mohawk.

961
00:46:27,886 --> 00:46:30,620
Hey, quit
fucking around, and get up.

962
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,791
Come on. Get up!

963
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:37,894
Carter.

964
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:41,631
Carter?

965
00:46:47,704 --> 00:46:49,572
Hey.

966
00:46:49,574 --> 00:46:51,641
Hey.

967
00:46:51,643 --> 00:46:54,110
Get up!

968
00:46:54,112 --> 00:46:56,078
Get up!

969
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,079
C--

970
00:46:57,081 --> 00:46:58,214
Hey.

971
00:46:58,216 --> 00:47:00,917
Hey! Come on.

972
00:47:00,919 --> 00:47:02,885
Come on.

973
00:47:02,887 --> 00:47:04,353
Carter.

974
00:47:06,256 --> 00:47:07,824
Oh, shit.

975
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:11,928
Oh, man.

976
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:13,663
I'm so sorry.

977
00:47:13,665 --> 00:47:16,999
Carter, come on, buddy.
Wake up.

978
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:18,601
Wake up.

979
00:47:18,603 --> 00:47:19,936
Wake up.

980
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:26,909
Oh, my God.

981
00:47:26,911 --> 00:47:28,211
Oh, my God.

982
00:47:28,213 --> 00:47:30,179
Oh, my God.

983
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:31,814
Oh, my God.

984
00:47:34,785 --> 00:47:36,085
Oh, my God.

985
00:47:40,224 --> 00:47:41,490
Carter, come on, buddy.

986
00:47:41,492 --> 00:47:43,326
Get up. Get up.

987
00:47:43,328 --> 00:47:44,927
Get up!

988
00:47:44,929 --> 00:47:46,529
Get up!

989
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,832
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

990
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,903
Oh, my God.

991
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:58,774
H-Hey...

992
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,714
Ah, fuck.

993
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:08,751
What the--

994
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:35,278
It's gonna be okay, buddy.

995
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,746
It's gonna be okay.

996
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:39,615
You know, I was
thinking about it,

997
00:48:39,617 --> 00:48:40,983
and it's really funny.

998
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:45,021
We should have
thought about it sooner.

999
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:47,556
We scared
that old lady, man.

1000
00:48:47,558 --> 00:48:50,126
We scared her.

1001
00:48:51,528 --> 00:48:53,062
I mean, look at me, right?

1002
00:48:53,064 --> 00:48:55,665
I'd be scared of me.
I'm--I look fucking crazy.

1003
00:48:55,667 --> 00:48:57,700
But that's okay.
That's good. That's very good,

1004
00:48:57,702 --> 00:48:59,435
because she probably
went straight to town

1005
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:00,703
and told somebody
about it, right?

1006
00:49:00,705 --> 00:49:02,405
She probably went
to the first house

1007
00:49:02,407 --> 00:49:04,307
or store or whatever

1008
00:49:04,309 --> 00:49:06,842
and was like,
"Ohh, you gotta help me.

1009
00:49:06,844 --> 00:49:09,078
"Some crazy guy
with a crazy haircut

1010
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,713
tried to get in my car."

1011
00:49:10,715 --> 00:49:13,082
But I wasn't trying
to get in her car.

1012
00:49:13,084 --> 00:49:15,217
I was just--I was just
feeling it, you know.

1013
00:49:15,219 --> 00:49:18,921
I was just trying to
make sure it wasn't one of those, what, mirages,

1014
00:49:18,923 --> 00:49:21,090
like in the cartoons,
you know?

1015
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:26,929
But that's okay.
That's good.

1016
00:49:26,931 --> 00:49:29,332
That's very good, because
she probably told somebody,

1017
00:49:29,334 --> 00:49:32,535
and they're gonna come
out here and check it out.

1018
00:49:32,537 --> 00:49:34,136
They're probably
sending somebody right now.

1019
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:35,438
They're probably--

1020
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,173
They're probably
sending the police.

1021
00:49:40,944 --> 00:49:43,412
The police are probably
coming right now.

1022
00:49:46,084 --> 00:49:47,149
Carter.

1023
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:50,386
Carter, hey,

1024
00:49:50,388 --> 00:49:52,388
I think the police
are coming.

1025
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:55,324
Carter, I need you
to wake up, buddy.

1026
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:57,326
I need you to wake up!

1027
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:58,728
Carter!

1028
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:00,696
The police are coming.

1029
00:50:00,698 --> 00:50:02,631
The police are coming!

1030
00:50:04,434 --> 00:50:07,370
I need you to help me
make them understand how this happened.

1031
00:50:07,372 --> 00:50:09,271
Carter, come on!

1032
00:50:09,273 --> 00:50:11,073
Come on!

1033
00:50:11,075 --> 00:50:12,074
Hello!

1034
00:50:12,076 --> 00:50:14,176
Do you hear me?

1035
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:17,780
'Cause if you
don't help me explain,

1036
00:50:17,782 --> 00:50:19,515
they're not gonna
understand, Carter.

1037
00:50:19,517 --> 00:50:20,850
Come on!

1038
00:50:20,852 --> 00:50:22,885
Come on!

1039
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:27,556
You remember my keys?

1040
00:50:27,558 --> 00:50:28,724
Do you remember my keys?

1041
00:50:28,726 --> 00:50:30,726
I got a lot of things
to worry about.

1042
00:50:30,728 --> 00:50:33,062
Come on, buddy. Wake up.

1043
00:50:33,064 --> 00:50:34,964
Wake up!

1044
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:48,077
Fucking--I am sorry.

1045
00:52:16,033 --> 00:52:17,500
Carter?

1046
00:52:17,502 --> 00:52:19,435
Carter?

1047
00:52:19,437 --> 00:52:20,503
Carter.

1048
00:52:20,505 --> 00:52:21,804
Holy shit!

1049
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:23,172
Holy shit! You're alive!

1050
00:52:23,174 --> 00:52:24,473
You're alive!

1051
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:26,442
Carter! Oh. Okay.

1052
00:52:26,444 --> 00:52:27,510
J-Just wait here.

1053
00:52:27,512 --> 00:52:28,878
Just--You're okay.

1054
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,713
You're okay.
You're okay. You're okay.

1055
00:52:30,715 --> 00:52:32,715
Everything's gonna
be okay. All right?

1056
00:52:32,717 --> 00:52:34,383
What's happening?

1057
00:52:34,385 --> 00:52:35,451
What's happening?

1058
00:52:35,453 --> 00:52:37,186
You scared the shit
out of me!

1059
00:52:37,188 --> 00:52:38,621
That's what's happening.

1060
00:52:38,623 --> 00:52:39,622
Ow, my head.

1061
00:52:39,624 --> 00:52:40,823
Ohh. Oh, my God.
Quit it.

1062
00:52:40,825 --> 00:52:42,358
I can't believe it.

1063
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,793
I have the worst
headache I've ever had in my life.

1064
00:52:44,795 --> 00:52:45,828
Okay. All right,
well, just--

1065
00:52:45,830 --> 00:52:47,163
Just stay
right there, okay?

1066
00:52:47,165 --> 00:52:48,864
We'll get you
taken care of.

1067
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:52,668
Oh shit. Oh, fuck.

1068
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:54,670
Um...

1069
00:52:54,672 --> 00:52:56,205
is this all mine?

1070
00:52:56,207 --> 00:52:58,240
Yeah. Yeah, mostly.

1071
00:52:58,242 --> 00:52:59,408
Ohh.

1072
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:02,945
Jesus.

1073
00:53:02,947 --> 00:53:04,380
What the fuck
happened to you, man?

1074
00:53:04,382 --> 00:53:06,282
You.

1075
00:53:06,284 --> 00:53:08,017
Wow.

1076
00:53:10,888 --> 00:53:12,521
Okay, just--
Keep breathing.

1077
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:13,789
Breathe in.

1078
00:53:13,791 --> 00:53:15,758
Breathe in. Breathe in.

1079
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,459
Okay.
There you go.

1080
00:53:17,461 --> 00:53:19,261
All right.
Good job. Good job.

1081
00:53:19,263 --> 00:53:21,797
I hope I don't look
as bad as you do.

1082
00:53:21,799 --> 00:53:23,632
Let's just say
we're tied.

1083
00:53:23,634 --> 00:53:25,367
Let's just...

1084
00:53:27,437 --> 00:53:29,705
Um...

1085
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:32,308
what the fuck
happened to my hand?

1086
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:33,409
Oh.

1087
00:53:33,411 --> 00:53:35,211
Uh, it...

1088
00:53:35,213 --> 00:53:36,912
looks broken.

1089
00:53:36,914 --> 00:53:38,647
Yeah. It looks
really broken.

1090
00:53:38,649 --> 00:53:39,648
Yeah.

1091
00:53:40,918 --> 00:53:42,251
Look, I'm just--

1092
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:45,120
Look, it d--
It doesn't matter, okay?

1093
00:53:45,122 --> 00:53:46,956
I'm just happy that
you're alive and okay.

1094
00:53:46,958 --> 00:53:49,525
W-What the fuck
happened here?

1095
00:53:49,527 --> 00:53:51,660
W-We were arguing.

1096
00:53:51,662 --> 00:53:52,795
You don't remember?

1097
00:53:52,797 --> 00:53:53,929
No.

1098
00:53:53,931 --> 00:53:55,831
It really hurts
to think, actually.

1099
00:53:55,833 --> 00:53:58,100
Well, then don't. Just--
Just sit here. Rest.

1100
00:53:58,102 --> 00:54:00,102
It doesn't matter anyway.
It's over.

1101
00:54:01,005 --> 00:54:03,138
Oh, my God.
It's almost dark.

1102
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:03,939
Yeah.

1103
00:54:03,941 --> 00:54:06,242
And nobody's come?

1104
00:54:06,244 --> 00:54:09,144
No. I hoped that lady was
going to send somebody,

1105
00:54:09,146 --> 00:54:09,945
but she, uh...

1106
00:54:12,183 --> 00:54:14,783
Just take it easy.
I-I'll keep lookout.

1107
00:54:14,785 --> 00:54:17,486
Oh, watch out.

1108
00:54:17,488 --> 00:54:18,654
Oh, God.

1109
00:54:18,656 --> 00:54:19,755
Maybe
I just need to--

1110
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:21,156
No, no. You stay.
Just stay--

1111
00:54:21,158 --> 00:54:24,026
I just need to sit up
for a second.

1112
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:29,765
What the hell is that?

1113
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:32,501
Uh...

1114
00:54:32,503 --> 00:54:33,502
Well, it...

1115
00:54:33,504 --> 00:54:34,870
What the fuck is that?!

1116
00:54:34,872 --> 00:54:36,705
You don't understand.
I thought you were--

1117
00:54:36,707 --> 00:54:38,474
What the fuck is that?!
Listen. Listen.

1118
00:54:38,476 --> 00:54:39,508
Stay back!
Listen.

1119
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:40,743
Get away from me!

1120
00:54:40,745 --> 00:54:42,911
Come on, Carter.
I thought you were dead.

1121
00:54:42,913 --> 00:54:44,280
I thought you were--

1122
00:54:44,282 --> 00:54:45,114
Stay back!

1123
00:54:45,116 --> 00:54:47,116
I--I didn't
feel a pulse.

1124
00:54:47,118 --> 00:54:48,984
I checked your--
And there was no pulse.

1125
00:54:48,986 --> 00:54:50,552
I didn't
know what to do.

1126
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,490
So you were just gonna fucking
bury me in a hole?!

1127
00:54:54,492 --> 00:54:56,025
No, no. It's not like that.
Listen.

1128
00:54:56,027 --> 00:54:57,426
Are you fucking crazy?!

1129
00:54:57,428 --> 00:54:59,828
We were fighting,
and you pulled the knife on me!

1130
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:00,963
You broke
my fucking nose!

1131
00:55:00,965 --> 00:55:02,398
You get the fuck back!

1132
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,499
You bit
my fucking cast!

1133
00:55:03,501 --> 00:55:06,635
What was I supposed to do?
Come on. Just--

1134
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:08,504
You tried
to fucking kill me!

1135
00:55:08,506 --> 00:55:11,240
I wasn't trying
to kill you, buddy. Just--

1136
00:55:11,242 --> 00:55:13,709
Where you going?
What are you--

1137
00:55:13,711 --> 00:55:15,444
Stay the fuck back!
Okay!

1138
00:55:15,446 --> 00:55:16,445
Okay, okay. Listen--

1139
00:55:16,447 --> 00:55:17,446
I'll kill you.

1140
00:55:17,448 --> 00:55:18,280
I didn't know.

1141
00:55:18,282 --> 00:55:20,449
I panicked.
I panicked, okay?

1142
00:55:20,451 --> 00:55:22,918
I panicked.
I didn't know what to do.

1143
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,253
I wasn't feeling
all right.

1144
00:55:24,255 --> 00:55:25,888
'Cause I thought
you were dead.

1145
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:27,823
You thought
I was gonna do it.

1146
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:29,491
Didn't you? Didn't you?!

1147
00:55:29,493 --> 00:55:32,561
You thought--
You thought I was gonna do it,

1148
00:55:32,563 --> 00:55:35,964
I was gonna fuck up your--
your perfect little life,

1149
00:55:35,966 --> 00:55:38,300
and so you were just
gonna--gonna bury me,

1150
00:55:38,302 --> 00:55:41,503
bury me out here
in the middle of nowhere.

1151
00:55:43,341 --> 00:55:47,276
Your stupid, loner,
novelist friend...

1152
00:55:47,278 --> 00:55:49,745
No.
who no one would ever miss.

1153
00:55:49,747 --> 00:55:51,280
Hey, hey. Hey.
I didn't.

1154
00:55:51,282 --> 00:55:53,182
You stay the fuck
away from me!

1155
00:55:53,184 --> 00:55:54,650
All right.
Where you going?

1156
00:55:54,652 --> 00:55:56,151
Get back!
Where are you going?

1157
00:55:56,153 --> 00:55:57,753
I'll kill you!
Okay, I'm--I'm sorry.

1158
00:55:57,755 --> 00:55:58,921
Don't follow me.

1159
00:55:58,923 --> 00:56:00,489
Hey. I'm--
Please don't go!

1160
00:56:00,491 --> 00:56:02,424
Carter.

1161
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:29,618
Carter?

1162
00:56:31,354 --> 00:56:33,122
Carter?

1163
00:56:33,124 --> 00:56:34,823
Quit fucking around, man.

1164
00:56:34,825 --> 00:56:36,458
You're freaking me out.

1165
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,485
Ah, fuck!

1166
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:05,120
Get out of here!

1167
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:17,459
Hey, Mitchell.

1168
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:22,064
I'm not well.

1169
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:26,401
It'd be so fucking easy.

1170
00:58:26,403 --> 00:58:29,605
I just pull this
right across your throat,

1171
00:58:29,607 --> 00:58:32,341
and I cover you
in this hole, Mitchell,

1172
00:58:32,343 --> 00:58:35,444
and leave you
in this godforsaken hellhole forever.

1173
00:58:37,046 --> 00:58:40,749
You'd have to be
out of your mind.

1174
00:58:42,485 --> 00:58:45,153
No. That happened
a while ago...

1175
00:58:47,056 --> 00:58:49,324
and I still can't do it.

1176
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:57,699
Why are you in the hole?

1177
00:58:58,735 --> 00:59:00,502
Because it's warmer.

1178
01:00:18,214 --> 01:00:20,482
We're in here.

1179
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:44,506
You--Do you
hear something?

1180
01:01:09,633 --> 01:01:12,300
I would have
done things differently.

1181
01:01:14,203 --> 01:01:16,405
I'd have made changes.

1182
01:01:18,875 --> 01:01:20,709
Yeah. Me, too.

1183
01:01:25,648 --> 01:01:28,850
You know, It wasn't
that bad of an idea.

1184
01:01:28,852 --> 01:01:29,851
It's just we--

1185
01:01:31,587 --> 01:01:34,022
We just
didn't do it right.

1186
01:01:36,527 --> 01:01:38,660
Well...

1187
01:01:38,662 --> 01:01:39,795
next time.

1188
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:29,678
There's gotta
be something.

1189
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,561
Carter.

1190
01:02:46,563 --> 01:02:47,996
Carter.

1191
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:50,966
Carter. Carter.

1192
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:56,037
Can you walk?

1193
01:02:56,039 --> 01:02:57,305
Look.

1194
01:02:57,307 --> 01:02:59,074
I found another dot.

1195
01:02:59,076 --> 01:03:01,443
That might not
even be a town.

1196
01:03:01,445 --> 01:03:03,345
Well, then, what is it?

1197
01:03:03,347 --> 01:03:05,013
It might just be a dot.

1198
01:03:05,015 --> 01:03:06,581
Y-You can't have a dot

1199
01:03:06,583 --> 01:03:08,784
if there's nothing there,
can you?

1200
01:03:08,786 --> 01:03:10,118
I don't know.

1201
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,320
Okay look,
the sun set over there,

1202
01:03:12,322 --> 01:03:14,356
so that's west,
so we got--

1203
01:03:14,358 --> 01:03:16,792
Never eat shredded wheat.

1204
01:03:16,794 --> 01:03:17,793
Okay, so it's--

1205
01:03:17,795 --> 01:03:19,327
I-It's southwest,

1206
01:03:19,329 --> 01:03:21,429
so we--we gotta
go that way.

1207
01:03:22,265 --> 01:03:24,432
What if we get lost?

1208
01:03:24,434 --> 01:03:26,067
Or eaten or--

1209
01:03:26,069 --> 01:03:27,602
or something?

1210
01:03:27,604 --> 01:03:29,304
Okay, no,
w-we use the sun

1211
01:03:29,306 --> 01:03:32,507
to make sure that we
stay in a straight line.

1212
01:03:32,509 --> 01:03:34,476
Okay? I figure
in this condition,

1213
01:03:34,478 --> 01:03:36,578
we could probably go,
like, a mile an hour, okay?

1214
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:38,013
That's one day
to get there.

1215
01:03:39,448 --> 01:03:42,450
We should just stay
near the road,

1216
01:03:42,452 --> 01:03:45,020
and then s-someone
will come for us.

1217
01:03:45,022 --> 01:03:47,789
Okay, we haven't seen
a car since that lady.

1218
01:03:47,791 --> 01:03:49,925
And what if you're right?
What if--

1219
01:03:49,927 --> 01:03:52,727
What if this road was
closed down like you said?

1220
01:03:52,729 --> 01:03:54,963
I can't--
I can't keep doing this.

1221
01:03:54,965 --> 01:03:56,198
I can't do it.

1222
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,699
Look, if we're
gonna go out...

1223
01:03:57,701 --> 01:03:59,467
if we're
not gonna make it,

1224
01:03:59,469 --> 01:04:01,903
I want to go out trying,
all right?

1225
01:04:03,306 --> 01:04:05,941
Okay.

1226
01:04:05,943 --> 01:04:07,108
You go.

1227
01:04:07,110 --> 01:04:08,543
What?

1228
01:04:08,545 --> 01:04:09,878
You go. I can't.

1229
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:13,081
Shut the fuck up.
I'm not going without you.

1230
01:04:13,083 --> 01:04:14,082
I'll be fine.

1231
01:04:14,084 --> 01:04:15,350
No, you're not fine.

1232
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:16,918
You're lying
in a fucking hole. Come on!

1233
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:18,820
We got 3 hours
until the heat rolls in.

1234
01:04:18,822 --> 01:04:20,889
You can do it.
This is our best shot.

1235
01:04:21,924 --> 01:04:23,091
I won't make it.

1236
01:04:23,093 --> 01:04:24,426
Yes, you will, Carter.

1237
01:04:24,428 --> 01:04:25,794
You remember the Grand Canyon?
Remember that?

1238
01:04:25,796 --> 01:04:27,762
When you tied the rope to me
and you pulled me up?

1239
01:04:27,764 --> 01:04:29,097
Mitchell.
Do you remember that?

1240
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:32,234
I lost a lot
of blood, okay?

1241
01:04:32,236 --> 01:04:33,235
You go.

1242
01:04:33,237 --> 01:04:34,870
Come on. Get up.

1243
01:04:34,872 --> 01:04:35,871
Get up!

1244
01:04:35,873 --> 01:04:37,138
Come on. Get up!

1245
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:38,139
Ow!

1246
01:04:38,141 --> 01:04:39,841
Come on.
Wait. Wait.

1247
01:04:39,843 --> 01:04:40,976
Wait.

1248
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:44,379
Fuck you.

1249
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:45,380
Come on.

1250
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:46,882
Help me up.
Come on.

1251
01:04:47,684 --> 01:04:49,217
I'll carry your ass.

1252
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:03,031
Come on.

1253
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:11,373
Come on.

1254
01:05:14,144 --> 01:05:15,577
Come here.

1255
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:42,504
What?

1256
01:05:43,472 --> 01:05:45,006
I hear something.

1257
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:00,956
Hey!

1258
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:02,791
Hey! Hey!

1259
01:06:02,793 --> 01:06:06,127
Hey! Hey!

1260
01:06:09,132 --> 01:06:10,532
Hey!

1261
01:06:12,068 --> 01:06:13,969
Hey!

1262
01:06:15,371 --> 01:06:18,707
Hey!

1263
01:06:18,709 --> 01:06:21,209
Hey!

1264
01:06:23,946 --> 01:06:26,748
<i>I tell her
that I loved her<i>

1265
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:29,517
<i>And lived with no regret<i>

1266
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:32,587
<i>Oh, Laura<i>

1267
01:06:32,589 --> 01:06:34,456
<i>You just look away<i>

1268
01:06:34,458 --> 01:06:35,457
<i>Just look away...<i>

1269
01:06:35,459 --> 01:06:37,559
No! Hey!

1270
01:06:37,561 --> 01:06:39,828
Hey! Hey!

1271
01:06:42,165 --> 01:06:44,332
<i>Oh, Laura<i>

1272
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:45,700
<i>You just look away<i>

1273
01:06:45,702 --> 01:06:47,068
<i>Just look away<i>

1274
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:50,205
<i>Oh, nothing<i>

1275
01:06:50,207 --> 01:06:52,907
<i>Will get you to stay<i>

1276
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:07,722
Forward or backward?

1277
01:09:09,345 --> 01:09:10,345
Hmm.

1278
01:09:10,347 --> 01:09:12,247
Hey. Hey.

1279
01:09:12,249 --> 01:09:13,715
Got you something.

1280
01:09:13,717 --> 01:09:15,183
I got you something.

1281
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:45,680
Hey. Hey.

1282
01:09:47,816 --> 01:09:49,384
I found something.

1283
01:09:49,386 --> 01:09:51,286
Heh.

1284
01:09:51,288 --> 01:09:52,854
I saw something.

1285
01:09:58,060 --> 01:09:59,160
See?

1286
01:10:00,095 --> 01:10:02,297
Look. They go
to the town, probably.

1287
01:10:02,299 --> 01:10:03,298
Oh, my God.

1288
01:12:09,192 --> 01:12:10,958
Jesus.

1289
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:23,338
Come on.

1290
01:12:28,143 --> 01:12:29,043
We good?

1291
01:12:29,045 --> 01:12:30,511
Yeah. Let's go.

1292
01:12:33,782 --> 01:12:34,816
After you.

1293
01:12:34,818 --> 01:12:36,384
After you.

1294
01:12:37,753 --> 01:12:39,454
All right.
Let's just--

1295
01:12:49,798 --> 01:12:52,100
Is it heavy?

1296
01:12:52,102 --> 01:12:53,534
Yeah.

1297
01:13:01,677 --> 01:13:02,877
Heh.

1298
01:13:12,422 --> 01:13:14,021
Answer it.
Hello.

1299
01:13:14,023 --> 01:13:15,990
Hello. Hello!

1300
01:14:36,906 --> 01:14:38,673
Ah, you remember
Uncle Carter? Huh?

1301
01:14:38,675 --> 01:14:40,007
Hey, doggie.

1302
01:14:40,009 --> 01:14:41,776
Ha ha. Hey, what's up?

1303
01:14:41,778 --> 01:14:43,044
How are you, man?

1304
01:14:43,046 --> 01:14:45,213
Oh, I'm good.

1305
01:14:45,215 --> 01:14:46,414
Remember Uncle Carter?

1306
01:14:46,416 --> 01:14:47,582
Real good.

1307
01:14:47,584 --> 01:14:49,617
Hey, Cole.

1308
01:14:49,619 --> 01:14:50,785
Hi.
Hi.

1309
01:14:50,787 --> 01:14:52,787
Low five.

1310
01:14:52,789 --> 01:14:54,322
This is everything.

1311
01:14:54,324 --> 01:14:55,523
Yeah? That's it, huh?

1312
01:14:55,525 --> 01:14:56,991
Yeah.

1313
01:14:56,993 --> 01:14:59,494
Are you sure
about this?

1314
01:14:59,496 --> 01:15:00,895
Hey, Cole.
Yes?

1315
01:15:00,897 --> 01:15:03,664
Why don't you show Uncle Carter
his new room, huh?

1316
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:04,699
Yes.
Yes?

1317
01:15:04,701 --> 01:15:05,700
Good boy, Cole.

1318
01:15:05,702 --> 01:15:07,034
All right.
Let's do it.

1319
01:15:07,036 --> 01:15:08,035
All right.

1320
01:15:08,037 --> 01:15:10,004
Thanks.
You got it.

1321
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:15,109
So is this it?

1322
01:15:15,111 --> 01:15:16,310
This is it.

1323
01:15:16,312 --> 01:15:17,311
All right.

1324
01:17:10,192 --> 01:17:11,792
All right, buddy,
let's go.

1325
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:16,631
There you go.

1326
01:17:16,633 --> 01:17:17,698
You ready?

1327
01:17:20,035 --> 01:17:21,869
Are you sure
you're okay with this?

1328
01:17:21,871 --> 01:17:23,871
Are you kidding me, man?
It's the least I can do.

1329
01:17:23,873 --> 01:17:27,408
Besides, it'll give me a chance to
knock out a big chunk.

1330
01:17:27,410 --> 01:17:28,209
Yeah.

1331
01:17:28,211 --> 01:17:30,378
I'm proud of you, man.

1332
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:32,647
Well, it's just
flowing from me now.

1333
01:17:33,549 --> 01:17:35,249
How long is it
gonna take you guys

1334
01:17:35,251 --> 01:17:36,250
to circumnavigate
the world?

1335
01:17:36,252 --> 01:17:37,785
Uh, you know,

1336
01:17:37,787 --> 01:17:40,021
we're gonna stay
with the parents for a couple days,

1337
01:17:40,023 --> 01:17:42,690
and I'm still not entirely sure we're
gonna get through that,

1338
01:17:42,692 --> 01:17:44,725
but if we do,
the tickets are open-ended,

1339
01:17:44,727 --> 01:17:47,628
so we'll just pick
a continent and stay until we get bored

1340
01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:49,597
or, you know,
run out of money.

1341
01:17:50,732 --> 01:17:52,800
You know,
she's--she's not...

1342
01:17:52,802 --> 01:17:54,535
what I thought,
you know?

1343
01:17:54,537 --> 01:17:56,303
I mean...

1344
01:17:56,305 --> 01:17:57,605
I never really knew.

1345
01:17:57,607 --> 01:18:00,474
Yeah, well, she said
the same thing about you.

1346
01:18:00,476 --> 01:18:02,843
Yeah.

1347
01:18:02,845 --> 01:18:04,578
All right,
come here, you.

1348
01:18:05,914 --> 01:18:07,048
All right, man.
See you.

1349
01:18:07,050 --> 01:18:08,082
Be good.
All right.

1350
01:18:08,084 --> 01:18:09,917
Be safe.
All right.

1351
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:11,719
All right.

1352
01:19:03,372 --> 01:19:04,705
Hello.

1353
01:19:04,707 --> 01:19:06,107
Hey.

1354
01:19:06,109 --> 01:19:07,641
I wake you?

1355
01:19:07,643 --> 01:19:10,144
No, I just--I'm finishing
some stuff up.

1356
01:19:10,146 --> 01:19:11,812
What's going on?

1357
01:19:11,814 --> 01:19:14,448
Eh, you know,

1358
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:16,917
I just wanted
someone to talk to.

1359
01:19:16,919 --> 01:19:18,986
I'm feeling...

1360
01:19:18,988 --> 01:19:20,488
weird.

1361
01:19:20,490 --> 01:19:23,824
Has it occurred to you that maybe
you need some sleep?

1362
01:19:23,826 --> 01:19:25,426
I guess...

1363
01:19:25,428 --> 01:19:27,862
I thought that
I was past the point

1364
01:19:27,864 --> 01:19:31,031
where I really believed
that people could change, you know?

1365
01:19:31,033 --> 01:19:34,368
At least, the point
where I thought that I could.

1366
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:36,804
Sounds like
a pleasant surprise, no?

1367
01:19:36,806 --> 01:19:38,305
Yeah. Absolutely,

1368
01:19:38,307 --> 01:19:41,041
but I'm just not sure
I believe it.

1369
01:19:41,043 --> 01:19:42,443
Believe what?

1370
01:19:42,445 --> 01:19:44,478
That I'm really
doing this.

1371
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:47,581
Well, what exactly
is the alternative?

1372
01:19:47,583 --> 01:19:49,550
Well, this is gonna
sound a little crazy.

1373
01:19:49,552 --> 01:19:52,286
Imagine that. You called me
in the middle of the night

1374
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:53,988
with something
that sounds a little crazy?

1375
01:19:53,990 --> 01:19:55,890
Part of me
believes that...

1376
01:19:57,526 --> 01:20:00,361
we never made it
out of that desert...

1377
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:04,832
that we're just
lying there, overcome...

1378
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:09,703
and this is
just all part of our imagination.

1379
01:20:09,705 --> 01:20:12,706
I told you this was
gonna sound crazy, but--

1380
01:20:12,708 --> 01:20:15,609
And you didn't
sell it short.

1381
01:20:15,611 --> 01:20:18,879
A-Are you telling me
that you're not at all suspicious

1382
01:20:18,881 --> 01:20:21,482
that things have
gone so smoothly?

1383
01:20:21,484 --> 01:20:23,117
Suspicious? No.

1384
01:20:23,119 --> 01:20:25,419
I'm stunned,
I'm impressed,

1385
01:20:25,421 --> 01:20:27,388
but I'm not suspicious.

1386
01:20:27,390 --> 01:20:29,423
Well,
maybe you should be.

1387
01:20:29,425 --> 01:20:30,825
I mean, think about it.

1388
01:20:30,827 --> 01:20:33,527
Things may be
just a little too good to be true,

1389
01:20:33,529 --> 01:20:34,728
you know what I mean?

1390
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:36,964
Believe me, if I
was making this up,

1391
01:20:36,966 --> 01:20:39,700
there'd be a lot more
lottery winning and supermodeling.

1392
01:20:39,702 --> 01:20:42,436
Well, at least
convince me that it's probable,

1393
01:20:42,438 --> 01:20:43,804
you know,
that life really

1394
01:20:43,806 --> 01:20:46,440
can turn on a dime,
that you really can--

1395
01:20:46,442 --> 01:20:47,741
I don't know--
reinvent yourself.

1396
01:20:47,743 --> 01:20:49,410
Which is harder
to believe,

1397
01:20:49,412 --> 01:20:52,680
that things are finally going the way
you always wanted them to

1398
01:20:52,682 --> 01:20:54,715
or that the only way
it could be this good

1399
01:20:54,717 --> 01:20:56,283
is if it's all
in your head?

1400
01:20:56,285 --> 01:20:57,451
I don't know.

1401
01:20:57,453 --> 01:20:59,119
You don't have
an opinion on that?

1402
01:20:59,121 --> 01:21:00,688
Well, I don't
know about you,

1403
01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:02,289
but this better
be reality for me,

1404
01:21:02,291 --> 01:21:04,158
because if we're still
out in the middle

1405
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:05,426
of the desert somewhere,

1406
01:21:05,428 --> 01:21:07,494
I just finished
an imaginary book.

1407
01:21:07,496 --> 01:21:11,298
Wow, that's--
That's really, really fast.

1408
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:13,767
So tell me how it ends.

1409
01:21:13,769 --> 01:21:16,070
Well,
that's the funny thi--

1410
01:21:18,241 --> 01:21:19,974
Carter?

1411
01:21:21,176 --> 01:21:22,509
Carter?

1412
01:21:27,148 --> 01:21:28,616
Piece of shit.
