1
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,839
(He laughs)

2
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,277
Ha, ha! I won.

3
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,829
21...

4
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,552
to 19.

5
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,433
Three games out of four.

6
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,432
What do I get?

7
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,472
The boot?

8
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,192
That's right.

9
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,754
No!

10
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,994
(Screams)

11
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,079
(Laughs)

12
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,633
(Screams)

13
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,429
No!

14
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,471
(Loud rock music)

15
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,757
Turn it down.

16
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,430
Christ! It's bloody freezing!

17
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,998
It's bloody Arctic!

18
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,951
If you insist on going around naked...

19
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,509
What are you wearing tonight?
Cloak and dagger?

20
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,278
What would you suggest?

21
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,993
Ooh, something that will last
until four in the morning.

22
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,396
I'm not staying out till four in the morning.
I have to work tomorrow.

23
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,431
Oh, then wear something orthodox like a suit.

24
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,754
Hey!

25
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,950
Could you answer me just one question?

26
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,390
Is it black tie or isn't it?

27
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,910
- How should I know?
- Well, could you ring and find out?

28
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:08,397
She'll say some are wearing black tie
and some are not. All very democratic.

29
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,637
And all a big waste of time.

30
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,478
Oh, don't be so stuffy! And don't wear that shin.

31
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,115
Ah, pussycat, I want you to wear
the one I gave you.

32
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,832
Too small.

33
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,110
You must have had a dwarf in mind.

34
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,469
I love you in bright colours!

35
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,158
A peacock.

36
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,191
I love you anyway.

37
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,834
Let's go somewhere on our own tonight.

38
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,717
Gladys will have a fit.

39
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,751
(Sitar music)

40
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,351
(Lively Indian music)

41
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,790
Oh, my darling, wherever you got it, it's divine!

42
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,628
And I'm so glad to see you.
It was sweet of you to come.

43
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,353
Forgive me, will you?
I must get a drink. I'm parched.

44
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,391
I'll see you later.

45
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,476
Zee, my angel!

46
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,239
- Hello, darling.
- How pretty you look.

47
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,236
- Thank you.
- You, too, darling.

48
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,475
You're such a wonderful colour.

49
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,080
Robert told me you'd been to Spain for a week.

50
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,792
When did you get here?

51
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,717
I didn't see you come in.

52
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,116
- About two drinks ago.
- Only two?

53
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,638
Where's Robert?

54
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,398
Oh, out there someplace.

55
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,476
I'm mad about those earrings.

56
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,239
Oh, thanks. They're fake.

57
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,508
Pity.

58
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,873
Yes, well, you know, Robert insisted I leave
the real ones in the shop. Insurance, you know.

59
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,478
So sad.

60
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,836
Listen, if you're really looking for him,

61
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,556
the last time I saw him, he was lurking
behind a potted palm over there.

62
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,910
Well, I must go and find him.
I've something I have to tell him about.

63
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,234
Oh.

64
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,993
I bet you don't know
what the word "byssus" means?

65
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,235
No, I don't, actually, and I don't care.

66
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,794
Beard.

67
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,868
Having long, silky byssus, or beard.

68
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,239
Oh, how exciting.

69
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,236
Now, I wanted your advice.

70
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:32,831
There's some very interesting African sculptures
come up for auction at Sotheby's.

71
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,598
They're Nigerian, in point of fact.

72
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,153
But I think they'd be divine

73
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,679
for the rose garden.

74
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,359
Yes. Well, we'll go and have a look
one morning next week.

75
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,870
And afterwards,
we'll have a very smart lunch at Burke's.

76
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,831
Are you sure now?

77
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,711
Because last week when you said that,

78
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,591
<i>you forgot and didn't call.</i>

79
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,792
There is a lady behind you
in a silver dress.

80
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,159
Who is she?

81
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,952
No, the other side, the other side.

82
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,316
Oh. That's darling Stella.

83
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,191
Darling Stella?

84
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,718
Can you effect an introduction?

85
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,318
Of course.

86
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,909
But who told me you'd settled down
and were getting eight hours sleep now?

87
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,509
- That was during one of my fits of depression.
- You're a naughty boy.

88
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,118
Very naughty.

89
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,718
Is she a lady of leisure?

90
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,079
No, no, no.

91
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,758
She owns a boutique.

92
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,997
You know, Oriental tat,
but some rather nice frocks.

93
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,156
Er...Stella, dear!

94
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,794
There's someone who doesn't know you.

95
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,479
I thought you said
this was going to be a small gathering?

96
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:36,149
No, no, darling, not a small gathering,
just small people.

97
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,918
This is Robert.

98
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,433
Robert Blakeley.

99
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,475
Do you need a bodyguard?

100
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,198
No, I don't think so.

101
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,792
Well, now that I've broken the ice, I'll circulate.

102
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,990
And don't forget your promise to call.

103
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,519
Yes, Gladys.

104
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,552
What is this?

105
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,192
It's a Koran case.

106
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,958
It's got a dent in it.

107
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,718
I believe I bit it.

108
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,398
Oh, really?

109
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,000
- Do you bite everything?
- No.

110
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,519
Usually, no.

111
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,077
Are you a lady of leisure?

112
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,993
I'm afraid not.

113
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,828
- Well, what, then?
- I have a shop where I design dresses.

114
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,199
Oh.

115
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,912
Well, you can tell me,

116
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:42,272
would you say that
I am a particularly well-dressed man?

117
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,309
No.

118
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,191
- <i>Not particularly.</i>
- <i>No?</i>

119
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,550
Don't you think that you should take me in hand?

120
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,838
Clothes are a very personal thing.

121
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,199
<i>I know.</i>

122
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,992
That's what I mean.

123
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,829
- I think she looks like a bag of bones.
- Oh, really?

124
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,871
<i>I think she looks quite nice.</i>

125
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,150
- <i>Do you?</i>
- <i>Who is she?</i>

126
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,679
<i>I have no idea.</i>

127
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,751
I think I'll find out.

128
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,472
Excuse me, love.

129
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,397
Blakeley! I say, Blakeley!

130
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,635
- Your game next.
- Yes, <i>I'll</i> be right there.

131
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,838
Perhaps I could come to your shop
and you could do me some shins.

132
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,631
Most of my designs are for women.

133
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,875
Couldn't you make an exception in my case?

134
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,952
- Perhaps.
- Only perhaps?

135
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,198
You would love my family. They're all doctors.

136
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,231
What makes you think I like doctors?

137
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,477
Well, you know, I mean, it just shows.

138
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,033
I can't see it myself.

139
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,230
He's an architect.

140
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,430
He develops properties.

141
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,357
<i>STELLA". I know he's an architect.</i>

142
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,470
- I've heard of him.
- Have you?

143
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,996
Oh, it's not easy being married to a giant.

144
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,996
- Or a dwarf.
(Zee laughs)

145
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,871
It's not easy either way.

146
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,592
- Oh, agony, agony.
- Blakeley!

147
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,677
- If you can't come, we'll play on without you.
- I'll come right now.

148
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,119
Excuse me.

149
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,232
(Laughs) Oh, billiards. He loves his little games.

150
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,678
Do you play?

151
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,392
I'm afraid not.

152
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,952
Nor do I.

153
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,077
Ping pong is my sport.

154
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,350
Robert says because it's more aggressive.

155
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,277
Would you like to go watch them?

156
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,311
Fine, if you like.

157
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,439
MAN; Oh!

158
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,193
Good shot.

159
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,992
I really cannot stand this room.

160
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,191
It gives me the creeps.

161
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,988
Have you ever noticed
how Gladys always has one of everything?

162
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,713
One actor, one painter, one faith healer.

163
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,673
- But we all come and guzzle her champagne.
- Ha, ha!

164
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,280
She guzzles out of a silver mug.

165
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,594
Crafty.

166
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,996
You know, you can't get through to her
after 11 in the morning.

167
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,871
All her words begin to go son of...

168
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,832
"Robert, daaarling..."

169
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,510
Do you know she asks Robert
his advice about everything?

170
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,950
<i>Even having her face lifted,
she asked his advice.</i>

171
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,436
- It'll be my turn soon for that.
- (Laughs)

172
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,232
Well, now you know who to ask.

173
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,149
Me.

174
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,839
<i>Oh, but I like your face.</i>

175
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,951
Your shadows.

176
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,953
Marvelous.

177
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,749
We should have brought our embroidery.

178
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,510
<i>I hope he doesn't lose, or I'll get the blame.</i>

179
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,312
He's a bad loser.

180
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,237
<i>He's a miser,</i> too.

181
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:21,638
Do you know that he didn't even buy me
my wedding ring? He borrowed his sister's.

182
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,911
We got the weirdest wedding presents.
Do you know what one of them was?

183
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,793
A collapsible leather wastepaper basket.

184
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,552
<i>Yucky</i> green leather.

185
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,392
Er...did you get nice wedding presents?

186
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,880
- I eloped.
- Oh, good for you.

187
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,793
Where is he?

188
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,079
He's in the country.

189
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,712
Any children?

190
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,557
Yes. Two boys.

191
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,875
Oh, how charming.

192
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,232
<i>GLADYS:
Oh, there you are, my darlings!</i>

193
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,510
How nice to see you're getting along.

194
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,039
Yes, isn't it?

195
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,514
<i>GLADYS'.
You know, this room...</i>

196
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,915
<i>has always had a special quality for me.</i>

197
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,954
<i>It's a man's room,</i>

198
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,560
something they don't build into houses
any more.

199
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,636
Yes, thank God.

200
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,517
What did you say?

201
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,994
Oh, I was just telling her about myself.

202
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,351
You know, she told me

203
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,154
she's prone to weeping
if anything nice happens to her.

204
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,548
Yuck, yuck!

205
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,278
(Knocks)

206
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,639
Stella?

207
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,911
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

208
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,912
Open the door, then.

209
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,839
What's upset you?

210
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,869
Nothing. Really.

211
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,916
If I call, will you have dinner with me?

212
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,351
ZEE: Robert!

213
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,391
<i>We're all going dancing!</i>

214
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,476
I'm not going dancing, I'm going home.

215
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,078
<i>Oh, no!</i>

216
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,510
- <i>Me want my Bobby in my arms...</i>
- I'll call <i>you tomorrow.</i>

217
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,552
<i>Robert!</i>

218
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,795
- Oh!
- All right, I'm coming!

219
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,071
(Sings drunkenly) Bobby, Bobby, Bobby...
Dov'é, dov'é, dove?

220
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,872
Bugger

221
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,195
- (Squeals)
- You can out the little girl crap

222
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,549
because you're not persuading me
to do anything!

223
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,036
You're not persuading me to do anything!
We are not going dancing...

224
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,712
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

225
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,398
It's getting late.

226
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,559
You see that?

227
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,594
That is the first time in years that I've worn
a watch. That's what you've done to me.

228
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,632
You've made me count the minutes.

229
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,274
I've waited all day to see you.

230
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,596
What do you want to eat?

231
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,513
I feel I ought to warn you - I'm expensive.

232
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,836
I only eat the choicest things,
apart from cabbage.

233
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,077
Oh, really? Zee likes that, too, late at night.

234
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,111
I knew we had something in common.

235
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,311
Is there anything else?

236
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,277
I don't know that yet, do I?

237
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:40,157
People never want to admit they were in love
once it's over.

238
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,836
How they sat on a bench and waited.

239
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,552
Or danced all night.

240
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,518
Or went for a walk in the frost.

241
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,792
Blew on someone's fingers.

242
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,758
Everyone has two types,

243
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,268
and one is true and one is false.

244
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,436
How can you tell?

245
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,277
You can tell...

246
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,197
by the skin...

247
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,678
...and by the touch.

248
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,637
And by the eyes -

249
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,237
the windows of the soul.

250
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,793
(Laughs)

251
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,520
Come on. Let's go.

252
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,598
- Hello, Robert.
- Hello.

253
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,119
(Car horn)

254
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,798
A hummingbird.

255
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,637
- A pretty one.
- Yeah.

256
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,716
Well, wrap yourself up. It's very cold.

257
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,593
Would you like to be kissed...there?

258
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,039
No.

259
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,752
- There?
- Uh-uh.

260
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,432
- There?
- No.

261
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,993
Liar.

262
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,791
I lied to your wife.

263
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,550
I told her my husband was in the country.

264
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,990
- Whereas, in fact, he's dead.
- A-ha! That makes you a widow.

265
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,837
And a liar.

266
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,871
Where are we going to eat?

267
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,959
Well, do you want me to take you to dinner
or do you want to cook me an egg?

268
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,793
I don't know.

269
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,154
Why don't you cook me an egg, eh?

270
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,509
Because you can't cook.

271
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,551
No. I drop things.

272
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,151
You know how it is.

273
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,510
You get over being young
and then suddenly...you're young again.

274
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,911
I wish that we had met in a different place.

275
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,877
On a quiet road in the country

276
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,718
or a rainy afternoon in a tearoom.

277
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,075
Robert Blakeley, you said?

278
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,759

279
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,071
(Classical music on radio)

280
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,711
Well, here I am.

281
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,591
I told you we'd meet again.

282
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,477
Some lunch?

283
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,112
Oh, thank you.

284
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,833
I just love eating in-between meals.

285
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,911
You know, I saw a funny thing just now.

286
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,635
A man sitting at a long table with six or seven
women opposite him, all Indian.

287
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,955
- What do you think they were?
- Indians?

288
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,673
No, I mean the relationship.

289
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,990
- Sisters maybe.
- Hmmm

290
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,358
I wish I had a sister,

291
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,231
someone to confide in.

292
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,112
I love your shop.

293
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,196
It's so clever.

294
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,711
Bet you can't guess why I'm here.

295
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,671
I'm not clairvoyant today.

296
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,597
I never am on Mondays.

297
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,554
Well...

298
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,273
I want you to dress me from head to toe.

299
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,719
Oh, excuse me, madam.

300
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:15,274
- <i>Would you like me to put these in the back?</i>
- <i>Yes, do.</i>

301
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,311
Mmm, lovely!

302
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,032
Boys as well?

303
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,677
- Oh, what a pretty thing.
- But I'm afraid that one's sold, madam.

304
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,517
That never deterred me, dear.

<i>STELLA". What are you?</i>

306
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,198
I'm a 12.

307
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,071
Do you want to try it on in there?

308
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,395
Don't want everyone
to know you're a I 2, do you?

309
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,518
Why not?

310
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,557
I'm proud of it.

311
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,715
Real men don't like skinny women.

312
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,109
<i>They only think they do because
they're supposed to look better in clothes.</i>

313
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,799
But what happens when the clothes come off

314
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,355
and you climb between the sheets
on a cold winter night?

315
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,233
Then they like to know
they're with a real woman.

00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,116
That does sometimes happen, you know.

326
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,198
Mmm, what do you think?

327
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,073
No, no, it just doesn't fit. It's too big.

328
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,192
- I like it. I adore the colour.
- It's made for somebody else.

329
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,550
Oh, I don't care. Please, Stella.
I want it. I've got to have it. Got to!

330
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,635
Gavin.

331
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,159
- Yes, madam?
- <i>Bring a</i> pad.

332
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,839
Oh, super. Thank you, Stella.

333
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,393
<i>You know, I'm terribly lucky.</i>

334
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,512
Robert and I get along better
than anyone we know.

335
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,511
Keep still, will you?

336
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,996
We go coasting along,
each in our own little way.

337
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,918
We don't ask questions, Robert and I.

338
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,997
It's not that we have...secrets.

339
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,394
It's just that we trust each other.

340
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,476
Bust, 39.

341
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,954
I'm not dependent on him
and he's not dependent on me.

342
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,070
We're interdependent.

343
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,315
Shoulder to waist, 16.

344
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,352
- That's all right.
- Ooh, can I have it by the weekend?

345
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,556
I don't know. Can we have it by the weekend?

346
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,318
I suppose so, yes.

347
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,432
Can you deliver it? Do you have our address?

348
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,471
Yes, we can deliver it.

349
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,397
No, I don't have your address.

350
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,910
Oh, Stella, please, can I have credit?

351
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,996
I'm a little overdrawn.

352
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,516
I think we can risk that.

353
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:40,358
- You <i>know</i> how <i>it</i> happens?
- We do have enough of that material?

354
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,914
We've got some upstairs
but I don't think it's enough.

355
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,798
You'd better phone Reynolds,
see if they have any.

356
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,876
It's a bit on the thrifty side but...

357
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,639
...once he sees the dress,
I know he'll absolutely adore it.

358
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,755
When he knows it's yours, he'll be sure.

359
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,677
That's sweet.

360
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,631
That's not for sale. It's mine.

361
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,114
Oh.

362
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,752
Sorry.

363
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,234
Mustn't take what isn't ours, must we?

364
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,351
Bye-bye, love.

365
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,032
Are you going?

366
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,274
Yeah.

367
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,357
I have to change and shave
before I go to the office.

368
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,154
I suppose I should have those things
here for you,

369
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,838
razors and such.

370
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,030
I'm not a very good mistress, am I?

371
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,871
You're not my mistress.

372
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,871
We're still lovers.

373
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,437
I'll call you this afternoon.

374
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,119
I won't be able to see you.
My sons are coming back.

375
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,275
So you won't have to make excuses tomorrow.

376
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,390
I never make excuses.

377
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,479
And now you're beginning to sound
like a mistress.

378
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,871
(Plane flies overhead)

379
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,031
(Rock music blares out)

380
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,393
Good morning, darling!

381
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,477
Here we are. Isn't that a lovely breakfast?

382
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,318
I got it out of the newspaper's suggestions
for today.

383
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,352
- It's so nice to be domesticated.
- Now and then.

384
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,392
- How do you feel about going to the theater?
- I don't.

385
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,672
You know you can't go at each other
every night, darling.

386
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,551
I mean, you'll wear yourselves out.

387
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,512
It's only wearing
when it's something you don't want to do,

388
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,710
when it goes against the grain.

389
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,478
Oh, is it very genial?

390
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,717
Do you watch her make fruit salad?
I assume she can cook?

391
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,830
That would be one of her trump cards.

392
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,110
And I bet she has a footstool.

393
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,720
I can always tell the kind of cow
who has a footstool.

394
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,797
She suggests that you open a fish stall.

395
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,192
Oh, I can just see it all.

396
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,030
You spread out on a goat's skin rug,
recalling your childhood memories,

397
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,196
your traumas,

398
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,753
your poverty.

399
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:06,190
How you never got to see your mother
cos she had to go out and scrub.

400
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,232
And of course she's a good listener.
They all are at first.

401
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:12,909
Then, soon, you'll have to listen
to her little cantata.

402
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,793
Alone. Not understood.

403
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,432
And good.

404
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,232
So very, very good.

405
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,469
It's a little bit archaic, you know.

406
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,272
And who are you?

407
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,231
Miss Adventurous,

408
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,840
with the husky voice
and the long cigarette holder.

409
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,836
It's all a bit archaic, you know.

410
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,189
I bet the pair of you wail.

411
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,037
Why don't you make a record?

412
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,230
We'll make a lot of things.

413
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,679
<i>Ohhh.</i> ..

414
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,311
You know, you're in a muddle.

415
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,999
You don't know who loves you. There's her.

416
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:48,237
And there are all those adoring little apprentices
down in your office

417
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,352
with their hair and their tiny tits
and their drooling.

418
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,311
And there's me.

419
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,996
Why don't you take a lover?

420
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,673
Oh!

421
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,358
- Is that what you recommend?
- Yes, that's what I recommend.

422
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,439
I'll take care of the meals, the theater tickets,
and any other expense he may incur.

423
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,278
But, darling, remember how jealous you get.

424
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,519
I mean, you go quite mad. You start ringing
people up and going through my things.

425
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,039
You check my panties.

426
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,389
And you come out in all those little white spots.

427
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,351
It doesn't enhance you, you know.

428
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,991
Remember last month when I came
in that hire car to that bloody banquet?

429
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,870
And you were waiting for me on the steps.

430
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,150
All hot and bothered, weren't you?

431
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,670
Because I was sitting next to the driver
and it took me a moment to get out,

432
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,358
and you thought the worst.

433
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,551
You thought we were finishing something off,
didn't you?

434
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,036
And you had to have me
right then and there in the lane.

435
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,439
Didn't you?

436
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,156
- Didn't you?
- Get out of here, you slut!

437
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,399
(Key turns in lock)

438
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,000
And you love it! You love it, love it!

439
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,917
That's why you're still here!

440
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,996
You love the uncertainty!

441
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,837
You don't know what I did yesterday.

442
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,996
You don't know who I was with
or what I got up to.

443
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,474
You don't know what I'm gonna do today,
and nor do I.

444
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,272
<i>Enjoy yourself!</i>

445
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,550
Oh, I have, baby.

446
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,549
I had a thing with a doctor in Spain.

447
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,318
I love doctors.

448
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:22,319
He said to me,
"Shall I undress you like a doctor?"

449
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,033
<i>He was very good-looking, very hard-working,</i>

450
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,638
<i>six children, busy.</i>

451
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,716
<i>His waiting room was full of patients.</i>

452
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,194
<i>We could hear them
on the other side of the wall.</i>

453
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,112
We had to whisper.

454
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,957
But it didn't matter.

455
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,956
You couldn't hear his lips.

456
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,468
You couldn't hear him touch me and caress me.

457
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,034
He was so gentle when he touched me.

458
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,877
<i>He was panting.</i>

459
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,592
<i>He was panting,</i>

460
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,868
panting-

461
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,948
Panting...

462
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,353
<i>Panting.</i> ..

463
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,919
And?

464
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,030
Oh, baby,

465
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:04,359
I don't wanna be the cause of all those terrible
white spotties, booboo-de-booboo.

466
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,630
You had it off with him on the floor, didn't you?

467
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:10,116
Or maybe it was the couch,
the good, old utility couch,

468
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,594
with people on the other side!

469
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,073
Unfortunate people.

470
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,873
And you gave the doctor one of your quick jabs.

471
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,639
You swept the unfortunate man right off his feet.

472
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,591
It's a good job you can't conceive,

473
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,108
otherwise I would be maintaining an orphanage!

474
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,549
But you always get them like that,
don't you, eh?

475
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:31,116
You always get them like that -
a quick bang before they know where they are.

476
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:34,277
A punch in the face, a whiff of ammonia.

477
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,315
But you don't keep them, do you?

478
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,191
You can't keep them.

479
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,753
You can't keep the love of a man, right?

480
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,439
- I'm keeping you, baby.
- Yes?

481
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,392
Well, oh, no, you're bloody well not!

482
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,151
You son of a bitch!

483
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,151
(Rock music blares out)

484
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,636
And what the hell is going on now?

485
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,150
Well, I thought I'd go back to Spain
for a couple of days, get some sun,

486
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,350
maybe have a little physical checkup.

487
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,391
Oh, I suppose you think that's very funny?

488
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,079
I think we both need a vacation, chum.

489
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,192
- You just came back from Spain a week ago.
- That's right.

490
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:37,109
And you can tell that bag of bones of yours, she
can cancel that lousy dress I bought yesterday.

491
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,835
Where do you think I get the money
for you to go to Spain every time you feel like it?

492
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,793
(Southern accent)
Quite frankly, Scarlett, I don't give a shit!

493
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,116
If you ever get anything in your eye,

494
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,151
you put saltwater into it

495
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,839
and then you close your eye
and it makes it tear a lot.

496
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,552
Then the thing comes out.

497
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,068
- Couldn't you just cry?
- You mightn't be able to.

498
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,954
One of the boys in our dormitory cries at night
and eats nuts.

499
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,877
His parents are in Rio de Janeiro.

500
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,639
- I have to comfort him.
- How do you comfort him?

501
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:12,389
I say, "Pull yourself together, Chris!"
and things like that.

502
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,238
<i>His name's really Crispin, but he's called Chris.</i>

503
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,712
Do you like school, Sean?

504
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,033
I like home better.

505
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,471
I hated school.
All the boys at school used to call me Muggins.

506
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,273
So I went out and I bought a hamster,

507
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:30,232
a vicious hamster with vicious teeth.

508
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,831
I took it into school
and I showed it to all the other boys.

509
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,354
And none of them
ever called me Muggins again.

510
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,435
<i>Well.</i> ..

511
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,948
- I think you should go to bed. Come on.
- Oh, no!

512
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,992
- Come on! School tomorrow.
- Come off it!

513
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,031
Say good night to Mr Blakeley.

514
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,877
- Good night, Sean.
- Sean!

515
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,797
- Good night.
- Good night, Oscar.

516
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,798
- Now, up. I won't be long.
- Come on, Oscar.

517
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,308
Brush your teeth. Night.
- OK Good night Mummy.

518
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,316
- Night.
- Don '1' be long.

519
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,431
Will you sleep?

520
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,198
I hope so.

521
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,351
But I doubt it.

522
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,676
I hope you enjoyed my family.

523
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:19,113
- I'm sorry it wasn't much of an evening.
- Don't be sorry.

524
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,555
I think your boys are charming little men.

525
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,232
Where will you go now?

526
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,157
Home, I suppose.

527
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,077
When is she coming back?

528
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,712
I don't know.

529
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,671
She'll be away for a few days.

530
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,958
Tomorrow night,

531
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,355
my housekeeper will cook us dinner.

532
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,072
And we'll be alone, the two of us, all right?

533
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,712
You must go.

534
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,239
Must I?

535
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,911
- Must I?
- Yes.

536
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,231
- Good night.
- Good night.

537
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,158
(Clears throat)

538
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,998
Say whatever it is you have come to say.

539
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,474
Mrs Blakeley is downstairs.

540
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,751
- What?
- Your wife is downstairs.

541
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,950
My what is where?

542
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,230
Why the hell didn't you tell me before?

543
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,475
<i>You said you didn't want to be disturbed.</i>

544
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,829
- What time is it?
- 6:30.

545
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,713
She got here before six.
She insisted I came to tell you.

546
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,150
Well, tell her I'm not here.
Tell her... Tell her I've gone away.

547
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,997
<i>Tell her any damn thing!</i>

548
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,555
I've already told her you were working
and didn't want to be disturbed.

549
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,318
You bungle everything, don't you?

550
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,591
<i>Well, would you like to tell her
that you were misinformed?</i>

551
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,710
- No.
- No.

552
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,194
I thought you wouldn't. Damn it.

553
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,438
Well, would you do me one favour
and get your glasses repaired?

554
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,630
They're beginning to get on my nerves.

555
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,477
Both them and you!

556
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,478
Get a pair on the bloody National Health!

557
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,791
<i>Do you think I've got money to burn</i>

558
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,274
while you go flying off to Spain for one night?

559
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,392
- Well, it was cold and it was wet.
- Well, if...

560
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,317
ZEE: What the hell did you expect me to do?

561
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,476
- Just sit there and...
- No.

562
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,715
...stare out of the window and look at the rain?

563
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,149
No, I expected you to have some sense,
that's all.

564
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,474
Oh!

565
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,193
You must have had a rough day today.

566
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,798
No, I had a very good day.

567
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,193
<i>Did you?</i>

568
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:01,233
<i>I tried to call you last night
to say! was sorry, but...</i>

569
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,231
.there was no answer.

570
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,838
I was out.

571
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,437
Where do you want to eat?

572
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,392
Why, home, darling.

573
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,874
Home sweet home.

574
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,668
I don't think there's a lot to eat at home.

575
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,472
Oh, we'll find something.

576
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,958
We could go over to Gladys's.

577
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,195
<i>She's having people to dinner.</i>

578
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,549
I wouldn't dream of that, darling.

579
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,796
I just want to go home with you and relax.

580
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,471
Look...

581
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:44,718
- I think there's something I should tell you.
- Oh, later, darling, when we're home.

582
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,830
I'm too tired to listen even.

583
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,599
(Tires screech)

584
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,517
(Car horns)

585
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,551
(Rock music on stereo)

586
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,188
Oh, intimate.

587
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,071
Hors doeuvres.

588
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,076
How lovely!

589
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,111
What are we having?

590
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,118
Or should I say, who are we having?

591
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,832
And a note from our trusted housekeeper.

592
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,912
"Dear Sir Robert..."

593
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,393
Sir?

594
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,715
<i>You haven't been knighted yet, sweetie.</i>

595
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,830
"The joint...is in the oven...

596
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,831
...and should be ready at 8:30.

597
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,632
Hope everything is to your satisfaction.

598
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,671
Yours truly, Bea Donovan."

599
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:52,236
Our ex-housekeeper hopes
everything is to your satisfaction.

600
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,797
Quite a wit, our Mrs Thing,
when she puts pen to paper.

601
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,757
I always was warned off the Irish.

602
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,119
Really?

603
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,111
They speak very well of you.

604
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,353
(Doorbell)

605
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,152
Ha-ha! Ho-ho!

606
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,475
Our mystery caller.

607
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,909
It's no mystery to me, baby.

608
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,158
Bob, seriously,

609
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,758
would you...

610
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,394
would you like me to make myself scarce?

611
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,438
(Doorbell)

612
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,919
(Gasps) Why, if it isn't darling Stella!

613
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,190
<i>What a lovely surprise.</i>

614
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,277
<i>Come in, come in, come in.
Let me take your cloak.</i>

615
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,709
And what is that?

616
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,034
- Our first course.
- Ah!

617
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,439
Pate!

618
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:00,472
Did you make it yourself?
I bet you did, didn't you?

619
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,272
- Yes.
- Ah, you see.

620
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,791
<i>I told you she would know how to cook.
I just knew it.</i>

621
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,472
Did you take quantities of belly of pork and veal

622
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,193
and oddments from wild duck and pheasant,

623
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:16,391
and dry white wine and juniper berries and...

624
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,597
...mmm, carcasses and all that?

625
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,039
Zee.

626
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,911
Will you shut up?

627
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,634
Well, I wasn't being vicious, was I?

628
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,120
I don't know. Were you?

629
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,479
<i>Me?</i>

630
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,151
Would you like a Martini?

631
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,156
Make the lady some Martini, booby.

632
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,993
<i>Your hands are cold.</i>

633
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,270
Hard to get a taxi.
They'd gone home to their tea.

634
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,880
- Pigs.
- He tried to charge me double.

635
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,718
- <i>He thought! was a Norwegian.</i>
- <i>Are you, Stella?</i>

636
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,437
Of course not!

637
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,790
She's a Celt, from the top 0' the mornin' country.

638
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,070
Actually, I have Spanish blood.

639
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,588
A-ha! Toro!

640
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,068
Ta.

641
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,633
Thank you.

642
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,633
Cheers.

643
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,269
Oh...

644
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:26,914
Er..Robert collects fish.

645
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,190
<i>He has a whole collection.</i>

646
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,958
<i>There</i> are...

647
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,072
puffers and walking fish

648
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,680
and flying fish and kissing fish

649
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,439
and er. . .scavengers

650
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,552
<i>and barracuda and...</i>

651
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,074
...piranha.

652
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,554
<i>You know, they eat other fish</i>

653
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,797
and...cows and things like that.

654
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,671
They're Robert's favourite fish.

655
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,234
He never said they were his favourite.

656
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:56,508
<i>(Laughs)</i>

657
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,471
Robert loves the sea.

658
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,192
He never said he loved the sea either.

659
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,431
So he doesn't love the sea.

660
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,234
And what did you do today?
Did you have some lovely fittings?

661
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,838
I had a lovely day.

662
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,791
I didn't go near the shop.

663
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,796
<i>My boys were going back to school.</i>

664
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,148
- <i>How old are they?</i>
- <i>Nine. They're twins.</i>

665
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,757
Twins!

666
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,234
Oh, you didn't tell me!

667
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,838
Did you breast-feed them?

668
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:27,919
<i>I sat next to a man at dinner one night</i>

669
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,190
whose wife had just given birth to twins.

670
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,117
And he said, "You haven't lived

671
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,277
until you have seen a woman breast-feed twins."

672
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:38,949
Evidently,
his wife would lie sprawled on the bed,

673
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,992
a tit in either direction,

674
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,600
and it was just evidently fantastic.

675
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,392
I didn't have enough milk.

676
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,673
Oh.

677
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,715
You know, I read in the papers once

678
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,753
about a sheepdog,
I think it was a Pyrenees sheepdog,

679
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,314
that had 14 puppies

680
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,635
and only 12 tits.

681
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,477
Isn't nature cruel?

682
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,080
12 out of 14's not so cruel.

683
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:11,192
- The twins have survived, anyway.
- Oh, that's nice.

684
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:12,958
I wish I'd met them.

685
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,072
I love little boys and little girls.

686
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,795
Wouldn't you like to chew on a bone
or a piece of gristle?

687
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,676
What a good idea!

688
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,952
<i>Why don't you take us
to our favourite restaurant, huh?</i>

689
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,151
With people around,
it might help fill in some of the gaps.

690
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,191
I'll go get my clobber, OK?

691
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,793
Gaps?

692
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,511
I didn't notice any gaps.

693
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,118
Did you?

694
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,832
Chasms.

695
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,435
Well, I'm ready.

696
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,711
<i>Oh, er...Bobby, darling,
would you douse the fire?</i>

697
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,320
We do have our little economies.

698
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,631
<i>ZEE. It wasn't as in as it is now.</i>

699
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:19,275
You know, we used to have
our correspondence addressed here.

700
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,431
One day at lunchtime,
I found a pearl in my oyster.

701
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,153
<i>It was just a grimy little pearl, but still a pearl.</i>

702
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,599
(Clears throat)

703
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,757
- Ah, Signore, come sta?
- Benissimo, Signora.

704
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,998
He comes from Parma.
You know, where the violets grow.

705
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,678
And the ham.

706
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,119
(Laughs)

707
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,872
Did the boys go back today?

708
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,673
Reluctantly.

709
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,631
I wish I'd been with you to see them off.

710
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,274
I bet neither one of you
know about Parma violets.

711
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:52,598
Even if we did, we wouldn't deprive you
of the pleasure of telling us.

712
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,798
Well, they're very delicate,

713
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:01,435
<i>and they're what people give
when they want to give something really special.</i>

714
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,358
When they're in love...

715
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,675
- or someone dies...
(Waiter clears throat)

716
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,951
Ah, yes, now let me see. What shall we have?

717
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,590
I think we should have some pasta to start

718
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,632
<i>How about cannelloni? I adore cannelloni.</i>

719
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,875
Then we should have - let me see...

720
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,358
Chicken cacciatore, how's that?

721
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,913
Sounds fine.

722
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,439
And for the signore?

723
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,598
Melon and Dover sole.

724
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,756
Melon and Dover sole!

725
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:34,149
I think he's frightened of getting an ulcer.

726
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:38,512
- Everyone seems to have them today.
- It wouldn't surprise me, the way he eats.

727
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,232
He has nothing but fry-ups -

728
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:44,671
bacon, fried sausages, fried bread,
fried tomatoes, fried eggs...

729
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,312
<i>Don't you try and dissuade him?</i>

730
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,920
- I mean, with your own cooking?
- Web', sure!

731
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:51,554
Sure. But, you know, what can I do?

732
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,477
It's his background, really.

733
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:56,590
<i>How can you fight it?</i>

734
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,757
I mean, from what he tells me,
that's what they lived on.

735
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,918
<i>When it wasn't bread and dripping,
it was those eternal fry-ups.</i>

736
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,792
<i>We fried to put him on a diet so many times,
We lost count.</i>

737
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,149
I'm sure,
when I feed him a proper meal at home,

738
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,839
he just goes straight out
and has one of those huge lunches

739
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,394
<i>with sausages and chips and all the rest of it.</i>

740
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,149
- <i>Excuse me.</i>
- <i>If he wants to get fat and ruin his constitution</i>

741
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,760
<i>and get a pot belly, well, let him.</i>

742
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,234
<i>I mean, there's nothing I can do about it,
is there?</i>

743
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,590
If somebody has decided to do something,

744
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,631
they can't be stopped.

745
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,636
Can they?

746
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,551
(Phone rings)

747
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:38,230
Gino, would you give this to my wife
and tell her, "Buonanotte"?

748
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,713
Yes, signore.

749
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,318
Oh, allow me, sir.

750
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,359
ZEE: It's the most marvelous material,
divine colour...

751
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,356
- Sousa, Signora.
- Thank you.

752
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,191
Why, that bastard!

753
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,037
He's run out on us.

754
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,036
That dirty coward!

755
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:02,072
If that isn't just like a man, to run out.

756
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,151
Are you terribly upset?

757
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,474
(Giggles)

758
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,193
Not particularly.

759
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,791
Do you want to have a good cry?

760
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,671
I want to eat.

761
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:21,077
Well, tomorrow,
I'll get him to send you some Parma violets.

762
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,678
(Laughs)

763
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,796
My husband isn't in the country.

764
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,548
He's dead.

765
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,913
I know.

766
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,269
Why didn't you say so?

767
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,714
Oh, I didn't want to put you on the spot.

768
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,512
Anyway, you...

769
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,109
you ran out of the room
to cry or throw up or something.

770
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,390
So you're on the loose, huh?

771
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,391
Not completely.

772
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:59,989
I bet if we'd gone to school together,
we would have been good friends.

773
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:02,031
<i>You'd have been perfect!</i>

774
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,439
I might not.

775
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,069
I got expelled from school.

776
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,680
You did? So did I. What did you do wrong?

777
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,314
- No, what did you?
- No, you. You first.

778
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,839
- No, you.
- No, you!

779
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,154
- You.
- No, you!

780
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,792
- You.
- No, you...

781
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,195
- 35, please.
- That's all right, keep it.

782
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,196
- Oh, thank you. Bye-bye.
- Thank you. Bye.

783
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,559
ROBERT; Hello.

784
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,672
- I'm sorry I left. I couldn't carry on.
- You don't have to explain.

785
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:33,191
Yes, I do. I've told you that I didn't know she was
coming back. She just appeared at the office.

786
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:35,959
You're both so great
at appearing and disappearing.

787
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,752
But it's your little inferno.

788
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:40,997
And it's all very brittle and boring and trite.

789
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,270
Boy, you're a pain in the ass, you know that?

790
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,788
No, just superior.

791
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:50,792
- Can't I come in?
- It's late. I'm tired.

792
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,149
- Let me put you to bed.
- Now you're being silly.

793
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,590
Let me undress you,
I'll make love to you while you're asleep.

794
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,392
Robert, no!

795
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:01,000
I want to feel you next to me very close.

796
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,678
I'm very stubborn.

797
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:06,395
- (Mumbles)
- You are awful.

798

♪ Give me wings and I'll fly

803
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:40,715
I have here a bill from Harrods.

804
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,796
"To dyeing and dry-cleaning...

805
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,590
£46."

806
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,950
I'll pay for that. Just leave it here somewhere.

807
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,877
You know damn well you can't!

808
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:53,559
I always know
when the housekeeping is overdrawn!

809
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:57,036
You start buying champagne and caviar
and the telephone gets cut off.

810
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,152
Just wait till she finds out you're a miser.

811
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,873
I have a feeling she likes to spend a bit herself.

812
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:07,516
Don't avoid the issue. We are going through
these bills before everything is out off.

813
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,879
(Sighs)

814
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,115
Bills always make us quarrel.

815
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,911
That's why I came straight home tonight.

816
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,951
You mean to have a quarrel?

817
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,197
I told you this morning
that we were gonna go through these bills.

818
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:21,151
And what the hell is all this for?

819
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,111
- I'm going riding.
- Riding?

820
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,754
Yeah, you know, horsey-horsey. (Clicks tongue)

821
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:29,076
Since when do people go riding
in the middle of the bloody night?

822
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:32,749
Some friends of mine called me
and asked me if I'd like to go for a midnight ride.

823
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,234
I assume they meant horseback riding.

824
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,350
Let's see if I have everything.

825
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,879
(Clicks tongue) Right.

826
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:44,071
You had better resign yourself to the fact
you're not going anywhere.

827
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,678
You just let go of me!

828
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,753
- Goddamn it, they're waiting for me!
- Let 'em wait!

829
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,234
Who are they, eh, anyway? Who are they?

830
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:55,238
Lords? Loafers? Layabouts? Eh?

831
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,999
That's it, yeah, come on, baby, come on!

832
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:01,555
- You're getting that jealous fever, aren't you?
- Oh, no, I'm not.

833
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,797
- (Laughs)
- Don't kid yourself!

834
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,832
- That's it.
- You hold still like that.

835
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,155
Now you have to tie me, right?

836
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,714
Yes, I'll be doggy. I'll be doggy on the bed!

837
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,399
- Go ahead, do it!
- Now try this!

838
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,919
(Screams)

839
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,869
You just leave me alone!

840
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:26,595
- There's your bloody hat!
- What the hell do you think you're doing to me?

841
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,949
You can't just do this to me.

842
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,073
- Now sit down!
- What the hell do you think you're up to?

843
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,111
You can't do this to me.

844
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:38,072
I'm a prisoner! I'm gonna scream!

845
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:40,111
I'll shout, I'll expose you.

846
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:45,512
I'll get all your bloody clean-living neighbours
in here to save me!

847
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:47,596
I want out.

848
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:50,712
(Screeches) I want out!

849
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:51,988
SHUT up!

850
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,151
You woman-hater!

851
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,952
You Jew-hater!

852
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,911
You Fascist swine!

856
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,469
Pussycat?

857
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,911
You're gorgeous.

858
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,393
Oh, no.

859
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,511
- Gorgeous.
- Uh-uh.

860
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:41,838
You'll always have women falling all over you
because you know how to treat them.

861
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,678
You use them, abuse them, make them suffer.

862
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:45,948
Uh-uh-uh.

863
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,638
I don't mind.

864
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,238
She's nothing.

865
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,111
If anything, she just...

866
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,957
whets my appetite.

867
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,871
I'll fight her a duel any day...

868
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,359
...and win.

869
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,118
No!

870
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:12,913
No! Don't untie me.

871
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,951
I want it that way.

872
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,514
There must be something you can do.

873
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,630
I've tried everything!

874
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:36,030
I think he thinks he's really in love with this cow.

875
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:38,992
Then do it to him, dear!

876
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,156
Have an affair with a gorgeous man.

877
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:45,192
If your lot would stop increasing and multiplying,

878
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,800
maybe there'd be somebody left to do it with!

879
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:51,515
There's no need to get personal, love,
or I shan't do your hair nicely.

880
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:54,028
Now then, what's she like?

881
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:55,638
A slob.

882
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,119
Worse than that, a soulful slob.

883
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,948
There's nothing I hate more than soulful people.

884
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,197
She's always a little out of breath

885
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,515
and sees beauty in everything.

886
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,312
Especially in shit.

887
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,998

00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,030
Anything you can find out.

890
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:23,509

893
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,272
Oh, what a bitch!

894
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:36,153
Yes, I am a bitch, open and straight!

895
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,668
There are plenty of men around.

896
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,314
She can have anyone she likes, but not him.

<i>Jesus, they even write each other letters!</i>

898
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:48,557
She refuses to have lunch with him
because she likes to brood.

899
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:52,798
Well, it's not exactly as though
you and Robert have both been angels.

900
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,751
Why don't we put a curse on her?

901
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,678
They're having a crash right now.

902
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,153
And he escapes by the skin of his teeth.

903
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:06,229
And she's disfigured.

904
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:09,511
I don't want to give her
the satisfaction of being dead.

905
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:14,037
Yeah, and her kids.
We'll put a little affliction on them.

906
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,150
Zee, I refuse to sit with you!

907
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,317
I refuse to have innocent children victimized.

908
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,713
Ah, crap!

909
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,598
You will do it, won't you?

910
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,232
I mean...

911
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,271
You go have a look at him.

912
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,912
Browse.

913
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:36,112

with a few new clothes.

914

I haven't told you what happened to me, have I?

915
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:46,029

918
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,719
Yes.

Come on.

922
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,753
Let's find them.

Someone just kicked over your dustbin.

931
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:48,199
Probably some of the local lads
having a bit of fun.

932
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,672
What's the matter?

933
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:56,833
Nothing.

934
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,910
No. Now, come on.

935
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,712
What's wrong?

936
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,315
You know that wasn't local lads. It's your wife.

937
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,271
She's possessed!

938
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:10,312
- Oh, don't talk nonsense.
- She'd do anything.

939
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,351
The other day, she followed me in a car.

940
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,191
I tried to hypnotize myself.

941
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,390
I tried to pretend she wasn't there.

942
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:21,319
You should have gone straight up to her
and said, "Why don't you piss off?"

943
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,552
I'm frightened.

944
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,195
Now, look, what do you mean, frightened?

945
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,231
There is nothing to be frightened of.

946
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,670
She's never gonna let us have any peace.

947
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,112
Oh, Stella, come on.

948
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:46,072
Now, don't cry, darling. Please, don't cry.

949
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,958
Look, I tell you what...

950
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,714
Why don't I take you away for a couple of days?

951
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:57,748
When?

952
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:01,919
Tomorrow.

00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:03,552
Eh? Tomorrow.

954
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,591

- <i>..is the 12:05 train for Glasgow</i>

959
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,996
<i>and Northwest Scotland.</i>

960
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:24,157
<i>Calling at Crewe, Carlisle...</i>

961
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,310
- (Laughs)
- I thought you weren't coming.

962
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:33,591
What do you mean, you thought
I wasn't coming? Of course I was coming.

963
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:35,471
I'll get the case, I'll bring the case.

964
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:38,432
- Go on, quickly, before it starts.
- Where have you been?

965
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,151
(Phone rings)

966
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,631
(Phone continues ringing)

967
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:01,558
Yes?

968
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,238
Yes, it is.

969
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,438
Oh, Christ.

970
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,792
Is she all right?

971
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,069
Well, there's not much I can do about it, is there?

972
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,074
Yeah, well, you can tell her that I'm sorry, too.

973
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,111
And you can also tell her

974
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:24,038
that the repair costs are coming out
of her expense money.

975
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,149
Right?

976
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,952
Goodbye.

977
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,798
Robert? Who was it?

978
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,751
It was a friend of Zee's.

979
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,552
That poncy hairdresser.

980
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,956
She's had some kind of accident
with my bloody car!

981
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,592
Why my car?

982
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,392
Is she all right?

983
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,431
Yeah, she's all right. She's just shaken up.

984
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:47,234
She probably ran it into the wall on purpose
to give herself an excuse to phone.

985
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:50,072
Did you tell her where we were going?

986
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:51,678
Of course not.

987
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:54,553
- Then how did she know?
- How <i>should I know?</i>

988
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,636
Perhaps she followed us on her broomstick.

989
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,910
<i>(Laughs) Oh, my God!</i>

990
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:01,918
Oh, she's incredible!

991
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:04,076
She's a pain in the ass.

992
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:05,314
(Laughs)

993
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,279
I'm hungry.

994
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,629
- Let's go and get something to eat.
- What, again?

995
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,671
Oh, I know, I'm gonna grow fat!

996
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,836
(Laughs) I'll love you anyway.

997
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:19,599
I'm gonna get so fat,
I'm gonna lose all my chic customers.

998
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:22,837
- Let's feel some of this fat.
- Enough of the passion, Tarzan!

999
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,552
I'm gonna get something to eat.

1000
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,512
All right, you get something to eat,
I'll build up the fire.

1001
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:31,189
When we get back,
we'll look for a place of our own, brand new,

1002
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:32,912
right in the middle of London.

1003
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:40,111
(Rock music on stereo)

1004
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:49,033
<i>If you wanna be with her so damn much,
why bother coming home at all?</i>

1005
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:52,072
<i>Just pack up your shit
and get (he heH out of here!</i>

1006
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:54,395
<i>As if I give a damn if you ever come back.</i>

1007
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:57,876
<i>I don't have to sit around here all weekend
waiting for you!</i>

1008
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,911
The rest is just crap!

1009
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,555
You can take your junk and get out of here!

1010
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,199
You've quite recovered from your accident,
I see?

1011
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:11,791
Why don't you get a flat? Better still, a mews.
She can have window boxes and grow things.

1012
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:14,274
Make sure the window faces south.

1013
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,436
And she'll spend a lot of time in the kitchen,

1014
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:18,277
at the sink, at the stove,

1015
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:23,394
making her goddamn homemade pate
and all that other shit she's so pompous about.

1016
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,158
Where's my car?

1017
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,475
She'll get fat, of course, once she has a man.

1018
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,670
Jesus, I've seen her eat.

1019
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:35,431
And she'll want more kids to make it richer,
fuller, you understand? To hold it together.

1020
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:38,040
Of course, you won't be able to give her any,
will you?

1021
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:41,117
You'll have to go to doctors, together,
separately.

1022
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,958
And you'll have to get drunk
to drown your sorrows.

1023
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,152
Then you'll begin to notice little things about her,
her smelly armpits, her greasy hair.

1024
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,668
And you'll have to get drunk, baby, every night,

1025
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,756
before you can get it upstairs.

1026
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,392
Was it an accident

1027
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:56,715
or did you drive it against the wall on purpose?

1028
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,716
Maybe I did!

1029
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:00,273
<i>Well, if you did,</i>

1030
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:03,153
you will be walking around on crutches
for quite a while.

1031
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,032
Oh, I wouldn't do that.

1032
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:10,995
You wouldn't wanna hum me again
and find out you were wrong, would you?

1033
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:14,669
You'd have to go to your head shrinker
for £15 a go.

1034
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:17,280
"Why did I do it?

1035
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:19,231
Why did I do it?"

1036
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,113
- Have the police got it?
- How the hell should I know?

1037
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,628
Is it in a garage? Tell me!

1038
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:26,557
Blast it, tell me!

1039
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,909
Hit me and I will!

1040
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,598
You rotten bitch! I'll kill you!

1041
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,473
- I'll knock your teeth down your...
- (Laughs)

1042
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,031
No, I won't. Oh, no, I won't.

1043
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:39,389
I wouldn't give you the satisfaction.

1044
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,711
You come back here!

1045
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,512
Come back here, you!

1046
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:51,030
- I haven't dismissed you yet!
(Door closes)

1047
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:59,515
(Mutters) You sod!

1048
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,311
You won't get away with this!

1049
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,351
(Mutters to herself)

1050
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,958
(Car starts)

1051
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:11,073
Hey, you!

1052
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:13,554
You forgot your junk!

1053
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,511
(Ringing tone)

1054
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:34,637
(Phone rings)

1055
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:35,795
Hello?

1056
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:38,752
Is my husband in your skinny,
chicken-like arms?

1057
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:41,678
- <i>He's not here.</i>
- <i>I didn't think he would be.</i>

1058
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:44,188
And before I open my fish stall,

1059
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:46,231
and while I have you on the blower,

1060
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:48,669
<i>there are a couple of things
I think you ought to know.</i>

1061
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,631
Look, this isn't any of your business.

1062
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:53,399
You take my advice and skip it!
You're not his type.

1063
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:56,671
<i>You're not fun and games.
Oh, you're a marvelous listener.</i>

1064
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,075
But listening is dull in the sack.

1065
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:02,829
It never made for a good marriage,
not his kind of marriage.

1066
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:06,998
He likes women to be a mess.
That's why he's still with me.

1067
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:09,349
- Can't you see that?
- Oh, shut up!

1068
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:10,674
Why...

1069
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,511
The blessed nerve!

1070
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:16,799
Bitch!

1071
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,876
All right...

1072
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,392
(Ringing tone)

1073
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,391
<i>I thought you'd left.</i>

1074
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:32,875
No.

1075
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:35,951
What's the point in that?

1076
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,433
Look...

1077
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:45,152
very simply,

1078
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:48,431
can you tell me where my car is?

1079
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:53,397
South Moreton Garage.

1080
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:57,313
Now, why couldn't you have said that earlier?

1081
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:00,311
<i>You didn't give me the chance.</i>

1082
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:03,236
<i>You just tore into me.</i>

1083
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,272
Who has it? Where is it? Is it wrecked?

1084
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:08,515
I didn't attack.

1085
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:13,748
You were feeling remorse
because of your dirty weekend.

1086
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,028
Well...

1087
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,915
I'll try to get a couple of hours' sleep.

1088
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:23,789
Bobby...

1089
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:27,680
Can't we stop all this wrangling?

1090
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:30,313
<i>All this hell?</i>

1091
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:32,909
Yes.

1092
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,836
As of now.

1093
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:40,953
Wake me at eight in the morning
with some coffee.

1094
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,638
(Door closes)

1095
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:45,079
Bobby...

1096
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:53,593
Bobby, Bobby...

1097
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:55,232
Bobby...

1098
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,350
<i>(Stella makes Native American whoop)</i>

1099
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:00,390
It can't be haunted because it's new.

1100
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:03,079
Nobody's lived here and nobody's died here.

1101
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:04,951
We'll liven it up a bit.

1102
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,991
You can paint the wall.
I don't mean house paint, I mean an.

1103
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:13,190
Anything you want. Look at that.

1104
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:15,231
They get away with murder.

1105
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:18,317
You'll have to put a couple of pillars in there
to support that.

1106
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:20,351
(Church bells)

1107
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,116
We can wave to the crowds.

1108
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:26,393
It's lovely!

1109
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:28,670
- Yes, it's not bad, is it?
- It's lovely.

1110
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:33,396
Shall we have it pink and gold or rosy or]?

1111
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,079
You can have anything you want.

1112
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:40,030
What's it going to be like living with you?

1113
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:42,150
I don't mean a night here, a day there.

1114
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:44,395
I mean, day after day, night after night.

1115
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,919
Are you a day bird or a night bird?

1116
01:04:48,840 --> 01:04:50,637
Are you grumpy in the morning?

1117
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:53,319
I don't know very much about myself
in the morning.

1118
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:56,431
Or any other time, I suppose.

1119
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,471
I wonder what's up there.

1120
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,718
Are you all right?

1121
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:06,558
Yes, I'm fine. I just feel a bit strange, that's all.

1122
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,311
How is she taking it?

1123
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:13,316
Oh, she's all right, I suppose.

1124
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:15,476
We've been through it all before for years.

1125
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:18,114
She's gone to her lawyer, I've gone to mine.

1126
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:23,075
The one good thing is,
we don't have any kids or financial worries.

1127
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:27,796
I think she'll move out altogether,
go and live in the sun.

1128
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,478
She loves the sun.

1129
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:34,798
Somehow, I don't ever see us
being completely happy.

1130
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:37,557
Oh, sure we will.

1131
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:40,113
We will.

1132
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:42,390
We'll do our best, huh?

1133
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:45,951
(Rock music)

1134
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:04,909
Hello?

1135
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:07,193
<i>Hello.</i>

1136
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:13,994
Where are you?

1137
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:16,998
Over here.

1138
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:30,348
- Hi.
- Hi.

1139
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:35,873
- Are you all right?
- Fine. Just fine.

1140
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,911
Was it babies?

1141
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:48,839
No.

1142
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,518
You should have some.

1143
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:56,118
Cos you're...

1144
01:06:56,160 --> 01:06:58,037
you're so fond of them.

1145
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:00,799
Yeah, I suppose so.

1146
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:08,794
That... That kid in your office building.
You know, the Cypriot kid.

1147
01:07:09,800 --> 01:07:11,711
Does he still chat to you?

1148
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:13,478
Oh, yeah. Yeah, he does.

1149
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,431
But you know what he's done now?

1150
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:21,229
He's bought a parrot
and he's trying to teach it to speak Greek.

1151
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:28,595
Can we have a pet?

1152
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:33,756
They die on us.

1153
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:39,157
One cat...

1154
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:42,351
...one hamster...

1155
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,630
one canary, all in a row.

1156
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:48,592
That was our unlucky year.

1157
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:57,633
Let me do something...cheerful for you.

1158
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:02,674
I know, I know.
Let's go to the Italian restaurant up the street.

1159
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:04,631
It's new and it looks all right.

1160
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,389
Oh, I can't. I'm in a mess.

1161
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:10,078
No, you're not in a mess.

1162
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:16,475
I'm still your baby, aren't I?

1163
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,558
Yes...

1164
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:25,878
...you are.

1165
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:32,679
No matter whose lover you are, whose husband,
I'm still your baby, aren't I?

1166
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:38,277
I told you we shouldn't have gone to that party.

1167
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,678
I knew we shouldn't have gone.

1168
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:45,398
You said Gladys would be upset.

1169
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:49,437
Well, damn Gladys.

1170
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:50,799
Come on.

1171
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:53,471
Get dressed. We'll go out.

1172
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,033
No.

1173
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:57,479
I'm finished.

1174
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:59,317
I'm too tired...

1175
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:01,078
too sleepy...

1176
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,278
...too late.

1177
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:08,596
I think I'd better go to bed.

1178
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,119
Come on.

1179
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:16,199
(Groans)

1180
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:42,519
Good night.

1181
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:45,553
Good night.

1182
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:51,439
Bobby?

1183
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,519
Do you...?

1184
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,990
Do you ever feel lonely with her?

1185
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,672
Yeah.

1186
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:12,071
(Door closes)

1187
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:13,712
Night.

1188
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:22,671
(Running water)

1189
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:48,559
Zee?

1190
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:50,113
(Bangs on door)

1191
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:01,031
<i>Zee! Zee!</i>

1192
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:34,396
You'd better travel in front with me, sir.

1193
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:43,031
(Siren blares)

1194
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,951
(Thunder rumbles)

1195
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,437
How long did they let you stay with her?

1196
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,951
For a few minutes, when she was out of danger.

1197
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,152
What did she say?

1198
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:23,793
Nothing.

1199
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,319
She was lost.

1200
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:28,112
She didn't know where she was.

1201
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,951
(Thunder rumbles)

1202
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,513
I think...

1203
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,114
...that she must love me...

1204
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,192
...quite a bit.

1205
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,432
Is that what you call it?

1206
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:48,758
Had you had a row or something?

1207
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,313
No.

1208
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:52,828
- On the contrary.
- On the contrary?

1209
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:54,836
- What?
- On the contrary,

1210
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:56,233
nothing.

1211
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:59,829
For God's sake, don't investigate,
don't question everything I say!

1212
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:02,599
- All right, I won't.
- Look...

1213
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,119
she almost killed herself.

1214
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:05,832
What do you expect me to do?

1215
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:07,279
Go to her? Cradle her?

1216
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:11,791
- Hold her <i>hand?</i>
- No! I do not expect you to hold her hand!

1217
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,831
(Thunder rumbles)

1218
01:13:18,080 --> 01:13:20,389
<i>It crossed my mind...</i>

1219
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:23,918
...to let her die.

1220
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:33,230
I almost...went back to the bedroom...

1221
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:34,952
and let her bleed to death.

1222
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:45,791
There was a time...

1223
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:49,196
...when I didn't know either of you.

1224
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:55,632
You were just names.

1225
01:13:56,880 --> 01:13:58,836
It was ages ago. I can't remember...

1226
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:02,877
who I was or what I did then <i>or...</i>

1227
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:04,512
who I went outwith.

1228
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:12,711
She asked me to ask you...

1229
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:16,195
...to go to the hospital and visit her.

1230
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,638
<i>Not to complain.</i>

1231
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,716
She just wants to see you and talk to you.

1232
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,751
She likes you.

1233
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:31,319
You get the job done, you see.
You have this air of serenity.

1234
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:33,237
You keep your head above water.

1235
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:36,396
I'm sick of serenity.

1236
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:41,317
I'm sick of the way I'm expected to be.

1237
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:46,955
I got short-changed too, you know.

1238
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:50,558
I had a husband I loved.

1239
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,078
We were happy.

1240
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:57,238
<i>We could do crossword puzzles
or paper a room together.</i>

1241
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:00,956
And when my children were babies...

1242
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:03,712
...he knew he was going to die.

1243
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,712
He had a cancer.

1244
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:08,398
A slow one.

1245
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:11,630
He told me things he would like to have done...

1246
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:16,555
...qualities he would like his sons to have...

1247
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:18,670
journeys he would like us to make.

1248
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:24,909
The last thing he said was, "The front of
the house and the woodwork need painting."

1249
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:33,429
Afterwards, I used to turn my pillow sideways...

1250
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:37,155
and pretend it was a man,
in case I woke up in the middle of the night.

1251
01:15:44,680 --> 01:15:47,797
So I'm sorry if I give the impression
of being in charge.

1252
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:49,671
<i>It's my mistake.</i>

1253
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,390
<i>But if it's astrological, people of my sign do.</i>

1254
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:04,072
Nevertheless...

1255
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:07,997
...I will always be all right.

1256
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:14,519
So will you.

1257
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:16,998
(Thunder rumbles)

1258
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:25,116
What is a nervous breakdown?

1259
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:29,199
Is it when you can't make up your mind
or something like that?

1260
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:32,038
Well, it's when you act out of context
with your environment.

1261
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,150
Oh, stop, stop, stop.

1262
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:37,833
Don't say anything. I don't want any definitions.

1263
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,638
Do men get it?

1264
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,676
One of my friends did once.

1265
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:46,756
He started ordering things by mail order.

1266
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:49,109
He had this fetish
about having everything clean.

1267
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:54,280
I don't seem to be able to come through
for either of them.

1268
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:56,595
You're doing fine. Honestly.

1269
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:00,428
<i>Don't be so bloody cheerful. You sound
like my mother during her war -breezy.</i>

1270
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,436
<i>That's what I</i> need.

1271
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:03,959
A war.

1272
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,912
The trenches. Life and death.

1273
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:08,951
Cold, hard, real facts.

1274
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,479
Something to get hold of.

1275
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,351
What's the matter?

1276
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:14,958
Are you crying?

1277
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,638
You are crying, aren't you?

1278
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:19,591
Come and sit down. Sit down.

1279
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:21,153
Relax, relax.

1280
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,791
Did one of your boyfriends stand you up?

1281
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,033
I'm sorry.

1282
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:32,911
I'm sorry, I don't know what it is.

1283
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:35,952
I mean, I have everything -

1284
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,468
nice flat, central heating,

1285
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:40,715
John comes every night.

1286
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:42,352
And do you come every night?

1287
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:44,879
You can tell me.

1288
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:47,229
Go on. Confess.

1289
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:51,034
(Chuckles) You can tell me anything...any time...

1290
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:52,798
provided I listen.

1291
01:17:54,680 --> 01:17:59,470
Someone asked me the other day,
my tailor I think it was,

1292
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:06,039
he said, "if your wife and your mistress
were drowning, who would you save?"

1293
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:10,756
And I said, "My wife...
because my mistress would understand."

1294
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,512
You're wrong.

1295
01:18:14,520 --> 01:18:16,112
Neither of them would.

1296
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:25,911
(spits)

1297
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:27,712
I'll plant them.

1298
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:29,591
You never know. They might take.

1299
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:32,750
You didn't know I liked gardening, did you?

1300
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:34,677
Yes. He told me.

1301
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:38,833
He never tells me anything about...you.

1302
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,871
He slips up sometimes.

1303
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:42,876
He calls me Stella.

1304
01:18:45,880 --> 01:18:47,677
You'll lend him to me, won't you?

1305
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:51,718
He's your husband.

1306
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:55,196
Oh, I just mean for a week or so when I get out.

1307
01:18:55,240 --> 01:18:57,754
Going back to an empty house, it frightens me.

1308
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:01,119
I know.

1309
01:19:02,720 --> 01:19:04,438
Of course you do.

1310
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:08,637
But your lucky number's coming up.
It's your turn.

1311
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:13,469
It's funny now one gets one's happiness
<i>at</i> the expense of someone else.

1312
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:16,433
Me of you.

1313
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:18,277
You of me, and so on.

1314
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:46,519
I got expelled at school
because I fell in love with one of the nuns.

1315
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:55,471
What a silly thing to be expelled for.

1316
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:08,599
L...

1317
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:13,714
I kissed her while she was picking me up
for one of the school plays.

1318
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:20,708
I was expelled for eating altar breads, or
whatever they call them, before they're blessed.

1319
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:26,638
What pan did you have in the play?

1320
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,199
I was a boy.

1321
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:34,238
Shall I peel you an orange?

1322
01:20:34,280 --> 01:20:36,077
Yes, thank you.

1323
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:41,835
You know, I think I could get quite used
to having you as my personal slave.

1324
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:45,510
Only available for limited engagements.

1325
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:53,995
Had you planned it for long?

1326
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:58,958
No.

1327
01:21:00,360 --> 01:21:02,237
It was a spur of the moment thing.

1328
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:06,828
I was tired and a little drunk, I guess.

1329
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:15,319
And I'd just heard from a friend that you
and Robert had leased a flat together.

1330
01:21:17,160 --> 01:21:18,912
<i>I suppose that triggered it off.</i>

1331
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:25,194
It was all...getting a bit much of late.

1332
01:21:26,240 --> 01:21:30,597
<i>Even before you arrived on the scene,
it was...a bit much.</i>

1333
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:37,557
I didn't know whether to talk
or be the silent type or what?

1334
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:41,193
But you'll be all right.

1335
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:43,996
You'll have a good time in the beginning.

1336
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:45,712
<i>The very beginning.</i>

1337
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:49,109
The way people do.

1338
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:52,031
Maybe I can be your bridesmaid.

1339
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:58,716
I was my mother's bridesmaid
when she married for the second time.

1340
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:00,318
<i>I was only eight at the time.</i>

1341
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:04,273
Of course, I didn't know
I wouldn't be with her any more.

1342
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:07,719
Why not?

1343
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:12,078
Oh, well...

1344
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:16,039
...the man she was marrying didn't want me.

1345
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:19,871
<i>We'd been so close up until then.</i>

1346
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:23,832
She was more like a playmate to me than...

1347
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:25,873
mother.

1348
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:31,390
Of course, you can't blame him.

1349
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:36,555
Who wants a great big girl of eight around?

1350
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,595
So <i>I</i> was packed off to school.

1351
01:22:44,480 --> 01:22:45,913
I don't...

1352
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:50,598
...remember seeing her many times after that.

1353
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:00,156
I've never told that to anyone.

1354
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:03,312
Not even him.

1355
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:08,311
You're the only one who knows it.

1356
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:17,671
What is this? Victorian or something?

1357
01:23:17,720 --> 01:23:19,392
<i>STELLA". Something.</i>

1358
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:20,998
I thought it was something.

1359
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:24,634
- Shall we have a housewarming?
- Yes, if you like.

1360
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:27,558
- We haven't any mutual friends.
- Oh, yes, we have.

1361
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:29,352
We have your boys.

1362
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:32,510
Do you know what Sean said to me
the other day?

1363
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:35,916
He said, "Please indicate to Robert
that great favour is curried

1364
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:38,155
with the material offerings of a stepfather."

1365
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:40,919
(Chuckles)
Sean sounds like a bit of a blackmailer to me.

1366
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:42,951
Oh, he is. They both are.

1367
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:45,917
And I've made lots of resolutions.

1368
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:47,791
I shall be less extravagant.

1369
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,637
I shan't talk in the mornings -

1370
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:51,272
I'm an early riser.

1371
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:55,552
Except on Sundays when I lie in bed
and eat toast and read the papers.

1372
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,756
And I promise I shall never have a head cold.

1373
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:01,910
We'll be a party in ourselves, won't we?

1374
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:03,473
Will we?

1375
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:04,999
Eh?

1376
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:08,677
Are you gonna stay tonight?

1377
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:12,316
No. I can't.

1378
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:16,353
Zee's invited some people over for dinner,
old friends.

1379
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:20,432
It's my son of...bowing out night.

1380
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:28,869
She always manages to come between us...
some way or other.

1381
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:32,515
It's my last evening. I could hardly say no.

1382
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:36,075
I have things to pickup, anyway.

1383
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:40,634
All right. I'll get on with the unpacking.

1384
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:44,200
And then I'll go out and buy some food
and flowers and...

1385
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:46,117
I'll get back as soon as I can.

01:27:50,440 --> 01:27:52,112
(Whisper) Yes, what is it?

1436
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:53,912
The party's over, dear.

1437
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:55,837
<i>I thought we'd say good night.</i>

1438
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:57,279
(Whispers) Good night.

1439
01:28:04,400 --> 01:28:06,152
Oh, my darling.

1440
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:10,352
Oh, my baby. Come here, darling.

1441
01:28:13,640 --> 01:28:15,631
(Wind chimes)

1442
01:28:34,480 --> 01:28:36,471
(Rustling)

1443
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:52,318
What are you doing?

1444
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:58,518
You promised you'd stay with me
until Gordon could move in with me.

1445
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:00,198
You promised.

1446
01:29:00,240 --> 01:29:03,596
It... It'll only be for a few more days.

1447
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:05,278
It won't work.

1448
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:07,470
But you... you promised me.

1449
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:10,671
I was so damned drunk last night,
I don't remember what I promised.

1450
01:29:10,720 --> 01:29:13,757
Anyway,
since when did we start keeping promises?

1451
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:19,357
Since last night when you took me
into the bedroom for a little talk.

1452
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:23,109
Last night is nothing but a blur,
another one of your damned games.

1453
01:29:23,160 --> 01:29:25,071
My games?

1454
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:27,918
You dragged me into bed! I didn't drag you.

1455
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:30,394
And you did an awful lot of promising.

1456
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:33,273
You took me! You! You! You!

1457
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:36,835
You got what you wanted, didn't you,
while I was drunk and out of my senses?

1458
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:38,916
Last night didn't mean a thing.

1459
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:40,996
Oh, yes, it did.

1460
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:43,235
But you're too big a phoney to admit it.

1461
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:47,239
(Cockney accent) Oh, baby, baby, baby, it's you.
It's you, baby. It's you.

1462
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:49,271
Shut up, you bloody slut!

1463
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:51,436
Shut your filthy mouth!

1464
01:29:52,160 --> 01:29:55,436
I am sick and tired
of playing your bloody games! I am finished!

1465
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:58,119
They are boring, brittle and trite!

1466
01:29:58,160 --> 01:29:59,912
You're finished?

1467
01:29:59,960 --> 01:30:02,155
You hypocrite.

1468
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:04,395
Go on, then. Piss off!

1469
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:07,637
Go to your perfect lady.
You make a perfect match.

1470
01:30:07,680 --> 01:30:11,070
A perfect pair of big, fat, phoney frauds!

1471
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:12,872
You're the fat fraud!

1472
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:17,516
At least she's honest. She doesn't need
a bloody game to keep her alive.

1473
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:19,232
Honest?

1474
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:21,669
You're such a fake!

1475
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:25,119
You're so weak and frightened, it's pathetic.

1476
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:29,233
You think she's going to save you, don't you?
Well, she's not. She's as big a fake as you are.

1477
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:31,396
And what the hell are you?

1478
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:35,353
I may be the worst thing in the world,
but I carry it in front where you can see it.

1479
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:38,631
I'm not a liar like she is.
Everything about her is a lie.

1480
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:41,877
Her whole life is a lie
and she hides behind a mask of...

1481
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:44,115
Good God, don't you ever stop?

1482
01:30:45,160 --> 01:30:49,597
You have to convince yourself that everything
is as cheap and nasty and rotten as you are,

1483
01:30:49,640 --> 01:30:53,235
otherwise you'd be back in the bath again
with your bloody wrists out!

1484
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:56,272
I don't have to convince myself.

1485
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,911
I think I know what she is.

1486
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:00,791
I think I know!

1487
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:03,750
She practically told me herself.

1488
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:06,314
Get out of here and bloody well leave me alone!

1489
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:10,319
I am sick of your twisted mind
spewing its garbage all over me!

1490
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:12,920
Twisting everything it sees into a mess.

1491
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:16,111
I don't want to hear it!
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say

1492
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:18,628
ever again, as long as I live!

1493
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:20,557
Leave me alone!

1494
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:26,068
I had a lovely time, sitting here last night,
waiting for you to turn up.

1495
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:29,032
It was absolutely wonderful to be woken
by Gladys this morning,

1496
01:31:29,080 --> 01:31:31,230
telling me I missed the best party of the season.

1497
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:32,679
Well, you didn't.

1498
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:35,757
Anyway, it wasn't the boring dinner
you insinuated it was going to be.

1499
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:37,358
No, I don't suppose it was.

1500
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:39,436
She said you danced with her half the night.

1501
01:31:39,480 --> 01:31:42,199
I don't know what I danced.
I told you, I was pissed.

1502
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:45,357
Anyway...you decided to stay.

1503
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:47,311
I didn't decide anything!

1504
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:49,112
I passed out!

1505
01:31:49,160 --> 01:31:50,559
Bloody hell!

1506
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:54,313
Space - that's what we promised each other.

1507
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:56,794
Remember all those grand phrases of yours?

1508
01:31:56,840 --> 01:31:59,308
Yes, and that's what I still promise.

1509
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:02,511
It's all the other things,
all the strategy, the intrigues.

1510
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:05,028
You're stringing her along, giving her hope.

1511
01:32:05,080 --> 01:32:07,753
I am giving her nothing except money.

1512
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:09,472
Oh, yes, you are.

1513
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:11,431
You're keeping it going by hook or by crook.

1514
01:32:11,480 --> 01:32:14,278
All right, what do you suggest?
Suicide or murder?

1515
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:16,595
Neither. Just honesty.

1516
01:32:16,640 --> 01:32:18,835
Last night, a party. Tonight, you'll tuck her in.

1517
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:21,792
We have separate rooms. You know that.
You've asked about it...

1518
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:24,718
I don't care whether you have separate rooms,
beds, gas ovens!

1519
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:29,231
I just don't want her name bandied around here
and her wants and her parties and her needs.

1520
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:32,431
Maybe she'd like me to sit on the end of the bed
to honour the proceedings.

1521
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:34,232
I'll put it to her.

1522
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:45,317
I don't want to see you like this.

1523
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:49,276
And I don't want to be seen like this.

1524
01:32:51,080 --> 01:32:54,959
You're everything I've ever despised
and I've become everything I vowed never to be.

1525
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:56,991
That's where our love has got us.

1526
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:00,879
<i>Right.</i>

1527
01:33:00,920 --> 01:33:02,751
That's it, then.

1528
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:05,718
Let's forget it.

1529
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:11,793
Look, I... I didn't set out to fall in love with you.

1530
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:15,190
I set out to have an affair.

1531
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:17,913
A little bit on the side,
the sort of thing a man wants.

1532
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:22,312
But I did...fall in love with you.

1533
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:25,712
That's what happened.

1534
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:27,830
And that's the way it stands.

1535
01:33:29,360 --> 01:33:32,079
As for the other things...her life, my life,

1536
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:33,553
well...

1537
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:36,191
it's all junk.

1538
01:33:36,240 --> 01:33:38,515
It's a mess and I don't want it.

1539
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:42,437
But I've got it.

1540
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:54,153
I wish now you'd let her die.

1541
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,911
Hello. Rita?

1542
01:34:13,960 --> 01:34:16,076
This is your boss.

1543
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:17,838
<i>What's going on up there?</i>

1544
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:21,429
There's been several phone calls for you.
Mr Nelson has some drawings...

1545
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:23,471
Never mind that.

1546
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:25,670
I want you to come and have lunch with me.

1547
01:34:26,600 --> 01:34:27,999
Where?

1548
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:29,598
Well, you know where.

1549
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:32,200
The same place where we always have lunch.

1550
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:35,071
All right.

1551
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:38,351
But it'll take about 15 to 20 minutes to get there.

1552
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:39,913
I'll wait.

1553
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:16,837
Your front door was open, sol let myself in.

1554
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:20,791
<i>I went over to your other piece,
but they said you'd moved.</i>

1555
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:23,992
Very nice.

1556
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:25,829
Clean.

1557
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:28,713
New.

1558
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:31,518
What do you want, Zee?

1559
01:35:33,880 --> 01:35:35,757
What do we both want?

1560
01:35:42,680 --> 01:35:44,511
I expected to hear from you...

1561
01:35:45,560 --> 01:35:48,393
...after our little talk in hospital.

1562
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:52,152
I don't know what...

1563
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:54,316
What on earth are you talking about?

1564
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:04,351
A girl has to be quite grown up
to be expelled for kissing a nun.

1565
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:09,512
How old were you, Stella?

1566
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:16,391
I'm sorry, Zee...

1567
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:19,595
...I don't see that that's any of your business.

1568
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:25,712
A child can't be expelled for falling in love.

1569
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:29,553
If you were 15...16...

1570
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:32,192
...well, then...

1571
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:35,993
And maybe there were other things.

1572
01:36:37,040 --> 01:36:39,634
<i>Other girls at school that</i> you...

1573
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:41,352
fell in love with.

1574
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:48,438
You can tell me, love.

1575
01:36:49,120 --> 01:36:50,678
We're friends.

1576
01:36:55,680 --> 01:36:57,238
There's nothing to tell.

1577
01:36:58,240 --> 01:37:00,674
Oh, come on, Stella.

1578
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:03,756
Don't make it so difficult for me.

1579
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:17,519
You're crazy.

1580
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:23,278
Aren't we all, love?

1581
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:26,033
Just a little.

1582
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:40,516
<i>ROBERT. Yeah, I called her at the flat.</i>

1583
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:43,074
<i>The telephone was out of order.</i>

1584
01:37:43,120 --> 01:37:47,398
Look, if you hear from her,
would you tell her I called, please?

1585
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:49,032
Yeah, OK, thank you.

1586
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:50,479
Goodbye.

1587
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:02,550
Well...I'm gonna have to get dressed
and get out of here...

1588
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:05,631
...before your young man arrives.

1589
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:08,751
I don't have to answer the door.

1590
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:11,109
He'll think I'm still working.

1591
01:38:12,120 --> 01:38:13,951
Don't be greedy.

1592
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:18,714
Besides which, that would be dishonest.

1593
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:39,671
- All right?
- Yes, guv. Thanks.

1594
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:56,718
Stella.

1595
01:38:56,760 --> 01:38:59,194
Stella, stop being silly.

1596
01:39:00,280 --> 01:39:01,838
Open the door.

1597
01:39:03,240 --> 01:39:04,832
Stella!

1598
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:18,398
What are you doing here?

1599
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:20,032
Oh, just...

1600
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:22,392
paying a little social visit.

1601
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:29,359
Where's Stella?

1602
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:32,357
In the bedroom.

1603
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:48,036
(Wind chimes)

1604
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:49,638
Stella?

1605
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:04,518
Stella.

1606
01:40:11,640 --> 01:40:13,073
Stella.

1607
01:40:15,320 --> 01:40:17,038
Leave me alone.

1608
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:18,752
Please.

1609
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:27,431
(Phone crackles)

1610
01:40:53,960 --> 01:40:55,791
What happened?

1611
01:41:01,680 --> 01:41:03,272
I don't know.

1612
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:08,949
- Listen, Stella...
(Zee clears her throat)

1613
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:16,599
Don't worry.
She's a bit confused right now, Bobby.

1614
01:41:17,400 --> 01:41:19,277
But she'll be all right in a couple of days.

1615
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:22,198
<i>Then maybe we can all get together...</i>

1616
01:41:22,240 --> 01:41:24,595
and talk over old times...

1617
01:41:24,640 --> 01:41:26,596
old loves.

1618
01:41:34,160 --> 01:41:35,798
Come on, Daddy.

1619
01:41:39,320 --> 01:41:41,390
Baby wants something to eat.

1620
01:41:45,480 --> 01:41:47,630
It's been one hell of a day.

1621
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:53,399
