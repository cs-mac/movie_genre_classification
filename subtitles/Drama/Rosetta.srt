2
00:01:55,134 --> 00:01:56,864
Come to my office

3
00:01:57,11 --> 00:01:59,325
I said come to my office!

4
00:02:00,768 --> 00:02:03,452
Did you tell them I’m always late?
- That’s not the issue!

5
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,789
- Yes or no?
I said it was 'cause of the bus

6
00:02:06,856 --> 00:02:08,834
That’s not important
Come to my office.

7
00:02:08,942 --> 00:02:12,502
Why’d you say she said that?
That’s not why you were fired!

8
00:02:12,611 --> 00:02:15,256
Am I a good worker?
Then why fire me?

9
00:02:15,324 --> 00:02:19,217
Because your trial period is over
- Why me, if I’m a good worker?

10
00:02:19,287 --> 00:02:23,180
You’re the only one on a trial basis.
Now change and come to my office

11
00:02:23,287 --> 00:02:24,602
Come on!

12
00:02:24,663 --> 00:02:26,228
Stop it!

13
00:02:36,634 --> 00:02:38,782
Leave or l’ll call the

14
00:02:41,555 --> 00:02:43,328
Calm down!

15
00:03:27,184 --> 00:03:29,165
Open this door!

16
00:03:29,271 --> 00:03:31,457
You have to leave!
You have no right!

17
00:03:31,523 --> 00:03:34,919
I did my job well.
Everyone says so!

18
00:03:35,652 --> 00:03:37,966
l’ll force this door open!

19
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:41,761
That’s enough now

20
00:03:43,409 --> 00:03:45,99
Let me go!

21
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:33,35
Shut up

22
00:07:36,142 --> 00:07:37,831
Any mail?
- No.

23
00:07:37,937 --> 00:07:40,790
There’s a fox on the prowl
Don’t leave food out.

24
00:07:54,619 --> 00:07:56,849
Why are you planting all that?

25
00:07:56,913 --> 00:07:59,18
We’re not staying here

26
00:08:32,948 --> 00:08:34,513
What’s this?

27
00:08:34,827 --> 00:08:37,12
It wasn’t me.
I don’t even like that brand

28
00:08:37,79 --> 00:08:39,890
How’d the cork get here?
- I don’t know.

29
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,980
You reek of beer

30
00:08:45,838 --> 00:08:48,523
He brought you booze
so he could fuck you, right?

31
00:08:48,592 --> 00:08:51,26
That’s not true. I’m your mother!
Don’t talk to me that way!

32
00:08:51,91 --> 00:08:53,114
Swear it’s not true

33
00:08:56,346 --> 00:08:58,119
That’s my tub

34
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,996
Leave me alone
- Go dry out.

35
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,95
Where’d you get that?

36
00:09:17,745 --> 00:09:19,680
Where’d you get that?
Someone gave it to me.

37
00:09:19,748 --> 00:09:22,181
- Was it him?
From where I got the clothes.

38
00:09:22,249 --> 00:09:24,18
You’ve been begging
- They gave it to me!

39
00:09:24,85 --> 00:09:25,977
- Why didn’t you say no?
I don’t turn down mending

40
00:09:26,46 --> 00:09:28,730
That’s different!
You mend clothes and I sell them

41
00:09:28,795 --> 00:09:30,485
Throw it out

42
00:09:31,6 --> 00:09:32,695
We’re not beggars

43
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:29,348
Not this one either

44
00:13:30,912 --> 00:13:32,227
Why?

45
00:13:32,289 --> 00:13:34,186
They’re summer clothes

46
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,147
l’ll take this dress

47
00:13:44,801 --> 00:13:46,532
Nothing else

48
00:13:48,138 --> 00:13:50,161
That’s 450 francs

49
00:13:56,315 --> 00:13:59,460
You need a salesgirl?
- Not right now.

50
00:14:28,13 --> 00:14:30,449
"The Grand Canyon"
Is that your address?

51
00:14:30,723 --> 00:14:33,78
Is that a cafe?
A fairground?

52
00:14:33,183 --> 00:14:34,789
A fairground

53
00:14:37,898 --> 00:14:40,1
I can’t put you down
as unemployed.

54
00:14:40,66 --> 00:14:42,461
- I worked.
Not long enough

55
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:46,881
Go to window 8.
You may be eligible for welfare

56
00:15:01,45 --> 00:15:02,608
Why won’t you take them?

57
00:15:02,674 --> 00:15:05,359
They’re out of season.
I have dozens from last summer

58
00:15:05,426 --> 00:15:08,903
The whole bunch for 500 francs
- That’s still too much.

59
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,411
Name a price

60
00:15:15,558 --> 00:15:17,289
Four hundred

61
00:15:18,937 --> 00:15:20,460
Three hundred

62
00:15:20,522 --> 00:15:22,295
Three fifty

63
00:15:23,441 --> 00:15:25,130
All right, 350

64
00:15:50,763 --> 00:15:53,990
One waffle, three beers,
and three nonalcoholic beers

65
00:15:54,682 --> 00:15:56,787
Did you take that girl’s place?

66
00:15:59,143 --> 00:16:00,208
Hello.

67
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,168
No problems?

68
00:16:21,85 --> 00:16:23,937
I’m leaving 2,000 in the till
- Okay.

69
00:16:25,381 --> 00:16:29,193
Sir, are you looking
for anyone to sell waffles?

70
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:31,780
Or anything else?

71
00:16:31,843 --> 00:16:33,824
Not at the moment

72
00:16:33,886 --> 00:16:35,284
Sorry

73
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:48,504
What did you talk
to the boss about?

74
00:16:51,405 --> 00:16:53,260
You looking for work?

75
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,397
Get me some water

76
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:11,26
When I used to get that
- I don’t care.

77
00:17:11,94 --> 00:17:14,903
- Let me tell you at least
You tell me every time. I’m not you

78
00:17:21,643 --> 00:17:23,415
Hold the glass for me

79
00:17:47,629 --> 00:17:50,24
It’s not 6:00 yet.
But you’re home

80
00:17:50,91 --> 00:17:52,859
’Cause I got fired,
not so you could go drinking

81
00:17:53,299 --> 00:17:54,822
Give it back!

82
00:17:55,718 --> 00:17:57,283
Give it back!

83
00:17:59,806 --> 00:18:01,120
Give it to me

84
00:18:02,894 --> 00:18:05,330
All you think about
is drinking and fucking

85
00:19:30,313 --> 00:19:32,44
Let me have one

86
00:19:32,148 --> 00:19:33,879
Get out of here

87
00:21:38,402 --> 00:21:41,462
Why do you bring her alcohol?
- Just one drink.

88
00:21:41,528 --> 00:21:43,674
You know she’s trying to stop

89
00:21:45,533 --> 00:21:47,553
- Give it back!
Leave her alone!

90
00:21:48,451 --> 00:21:50,308
Give it back!

91
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,476
You owe me 120 francs!

92
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,811
Go to a whorehouse
if you want to fuck!

93
00:21:55,876 --> 00:21:57,773
My mother’s not a whore!

94
00:21:57,835 --> 00:21:59,483
Leave her alone!

95
00:22:04,717 --> 00:22:06,31
Leave her alone!

96
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:22,130
Who told you I lived here?

97
00:22:59,357 --> 00:23:01,960
There’s an opening.
The boss fired someone

98
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:07,526
Okay, now we add
two quarts of water

99
00:24:07,591 --> 00:24:10,70
Get the measuring cup down there

100
00:24:10,593 --> 00:24:12,157
and set it here

101
00:24:15,434 --> 00:24:18,536
Hold tight here,
and careful with the pressure

102
00:24:26,442 --> 00:24:28,7
A little more

103
00:24:28,611 --> 00:24:30,176
Good

104
00:24:37,328 --> 00:24:38,893
Pour it in

105
00:24:43,85 --> 00:24:45,564
No, always back
where you got it.

106
00:24:46,588 --> 00:24:49,153
Now four sacks of flour

107
00:24:49,466 --> 00:24:51,529
I’ll show you how to carry them

108
00:24:52,302 --> 00:24:54,533
Slide it onto your knee

109
00:24:54,596 --> 00:24:56,368
and grab it like this

110
00:25:02,604 --> 00:25:04,959
Lay it over the edge of the bowl

111
00:25:09,652 --> 00:25:12,342
Pull on the string

112
00:25:12,741 --> 00:25:16,386
and move around the bowl
as you pour it in.

113
00:25:22,957 --> 00:25:24,562
Then back this way

114
00:25:27,754 --> 00:25:29,901
Now I’ll add 200 eggs

115
00:25:30,801 --> 00:25:34,736
Six trays of 20 each.
You get the other sacks of flour

116
00:25:36,513 --> 00:25:38,910
You forgot to stamp my form.

117
00:25:39,14 --> 00:25:40,496
I did?

118
00:25:43,689 --> 00:25:46,915
They said I was entitled to miss work
You can’t fire me.

119
00:25:47,23 --> 00:25:48,212
They’re wrong

120
00:25:48,276 --> 00:25:51,629
You know my baby’s sick
- Not ten times a month!

121
00:26:44,581 --> 00:26:46,519
It’s caught under the wheel

122
00:26:49,585 --> 00:26:51,67
There

123
00:26:55,551 --> 00:26:57,697
Anyone here?
- I’m coming.

124
00:26:57,887 --> 00:27:00,866
Wanna go for a drink?
I’m off at 4:30.

125
00:27:03,226 --> 00:27:06,37
Then see you tomorrow
- See you tomorrow.

126
00:28:23,512 --> 00:28:25,202
Look.

127
00:28:26,557 --> 00:28:28,246
That’s good

128
00:28:52,292 --> 00:28:54,356
You wanna take it to him?

129
00:29:03,847 --> 00:29:06,950
Tell him he can’t turn it off
without telling us first.

130
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:21,235
Get out

131
00:30:28,95 --> 00:30:29,784
The 500 francs

132
00:30:38,63 --> 00:30:39,628
A receipt

133
00:30:49,909 --> 00:30:51,723
Turn the water on first

134
00:30:51,828 --> 00:30:53,266
Pay and l’ll turn it on

135
00:30:53,331 --> 00:30:56,224
I’m here to pay the rent,
not to get the water back on

136
00:30:56,292 --> 00:30:58,602
I don’t see the difference
- I do.

137
00:31:23,609 --> 00:31:25,256
Brush your hair

138
00:31:29,948 --> 00:31:31,388
Get up

139
00:31:34,579 --> 00:31:36,309
And put your shoes on

140
00:31:44,172 --> 00:31:46,111
Where’s your ID card?

141
00:31:46,173 --> 00:31:48,154
In your box?

142
00:32:50,196 --> 00:32:52,135
I don’t want to go!

143
00:32:52,489 --> 00:32:54,54
Let me go!

144
00:33:16,847 --> 00:33:18,412
Come on

145
00:33:21,63 --> 00:33:24,248
It’s the only way you’ll make it
They’ll take care of you.

146
00:33:24,313 --> 00:33:26,502
I don’t care if I make it!

147
00:33:54,593 --> 00:33:55,991
Come on

148
00:34:02,146 --> 00:34:06,39
I’ll try to get you a sewing machine
when you come back.

149
00:34:11,902 --> 00:34:13,966
What’s a used one cost?

150
00:34:48,396 --> 00:34:49,794
Mom!

151
00:34:53,152 --> 00:34:54,966
lt’s all muddy!

152
00:35:08,625 --> 00:35:10,481
lt’s all muddy!

153
00:37:02,155 --> 00:37:03,678
Come in.

154
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:09,97
How’d you know I lived here?
- I asked the boss.

155
00:37:12,461 --> 00:37:16,146
You can put your cooking stuff there
and there’s water there.

156
00:37:20,967 --> 00:37:23,489
You can plug a heater in there

157
00:37:27,58 --> 00:37:30,118
I don’t think she’s asking much
- How much?

158
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,707
Less than what I pay.
Less than 5,000 francs

159
00:37:35,64 --> 00:37:37,44
There’s a shower over there

160
00:37:51,915 --> 00:37:55,185
Needs a little work.
I could fix it up for you

161
00:37:56,587 --> 00:37:58,647
Could I have those boots?
- What boots?

162
00:37:58,712 --> 00:38:00,360
Down there

163
00:38:11,892 --> 00:38:13,706
You make waffles?

164
00:38:13,771 --> 00:38:16,749
No, it’s just a waffle iron
I’m trying to fix.

165
00:38:16,814 --> 00:38:19,2
Want a beer?
- Just water.

166
00:38:34,289 --> 00:38:35,811
Give me the boots

167
00:39:04,528 --> 00:39:06,300
Did you win that?

168
00:39:07,572 --> 00:39:08,887
Yeah

169
00:39:10,118 --> 00:39:12,555
I was a champion
in floor gymnastics

170
00:39:12,995 --> 00:39:15,58
Well, provincial champion

171
00:39:27,842 --> 00:39:29,240
Wait

172
00:40:20,106 --> 00:40:23,417
You been doing it long?
- Doing what?

173
00:40:23,482 --> 00:40:25,546
Your scam with the waffles

174
00:40:25,609 --> 00:40:27,340
From the start

175
00:40:42,628 --> 00:40:45,689
What did you come
behind the stand to tell me?

176
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,443
Nothing

177
00:40:47,589 --> 00:40:49,70
Nothing?

178
00:40:50,593 --> 00:40:52,656
I wanted to watch you work

179
00:40:57,16 --> 00:40:58,912
More to drink?
- Yeah.

180
00:41:00,435 --> 00:41:02,0
A beer

181
00:41:12,449 --> 00:41:14,552
More French toast?
- Yeah.

182
00:41:21,289 --> 00:41:22,896
Thanks

183
00:42:11,967 --> 00:42:14,403
What music do you like?
- What?

184
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:16,365
What music do you like?

185
00:42:16,512 --> 00:42:18,284
I don’t know. Anything

186
00:42:19,308 --> 00:42:21,577
Wanna hear some drums?
- Yeah.

187
00:42:23,562 --> 00:42:27,82
lt’s me playing some stuff
I tape it to get better.

188
00:42:27,149 --> 00:42:30,127
You play in a group?
- I’m starting to.

189
00:42:30,776 --> 00:42:33,48
I practice on a friend’s set

190
00:42:34,821 --> 00:42:36,760
You play anything?

191
00:43:09,691 --> 00:43:12,210
It’s pretty bad.
I’ll turn it off if you want

192
00:43:24,621 --> 00:43:27,60
This part I do okay

193
00:43:42,766 --> 00:43:44,827
This is the same stuff
with my group.

194
00:43:50,438 --> 00:43:52,2
Not bad, huh?

195
00:43:54,527 --> 00:43:56,839
Wanna dance?
I don’t know how

196
00:43:56,945 --> 00:43:58,509
Doesn’t matter

197
00:44:13,461 --> 00:44:14,859
Come on

198
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:17,362
lt’s easy

199
00:44:18,91 --> 00:44:19,572
Come on

200
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,749
Hold my hand tight

201
00:44:34,274 --> 00:44:36,213
Keep your arm firm

202
00:44:41,823 --> 00:44:43,138
Hold on

203
00:44:43,826 --> 00:44:45,890
That’s where I mess up

204
00:44:58,633 --> 00:45:01,111
Watch my feet.
That’s the basic step

205
00:45:31,623 --> 00:45:33,145
What’s wrong?

206
00:45:36,86 --> 00:45:37,650
What’s wrong?

207
00:45:38,464 --> 00:45:40,361
Rosetta, what’s wrong?

208
00:45:43,718 --> 00:45:44,782
What’s wrong?

209
00:45:57,65 --> 00:45:58,796
I forgot the boots

210
00:46:03,947 --> 00:46:05,928
You want a ride home?

211
00:46:28,98 --> 00:46:31,160
I don’t want to go back
to the trailer tonight.

212
00:47:02,213 --> 00:47:03,944
Good night

213
00:47:25,904 --> 00:47:27,885
Your name is Rosetta

214
00:47:29,699 --> 00:47:31,513
My name is Rosetta

215
00:47:33,662 --> 00:47:35,476
You found a job

216
00:47:37,290 --> 00:47:38,979
I found a job

217
00:47:41,127 --> 00:47:42,983
You made a friend

218
00:47:44,255 --> 00:47:46,153
I made a friend

219
00:47:48,218 --> 00:47:50,282
You have a normal life

220
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:53,744
I have a normal life

221
00:47:55,518 --> 00:47:57,831
You won’t be left by the wayside

222
00:47:59,63 --> 00:48:01,334
I won’t be left by the wayside

223
00:48:05,26 --> 00:48:06,590
Good night

224
00:48:45,986 --> 00:48:49,6
You’re replacing me?
- It’s just temporary.

225
00:48:50,572 --> 00:48:52,385
Where am I gonna go?

226
00:48:52,451 --> 00:48:56,512
If a job opens up, it’s yours,
but I have nothing right now

227
00:49:07,756 --> 00:49:09,486
Where are you going?

228
00:49:13,929 --> 00:49:16,868
Why are you taking my job?

229
00:49:16,931 --> 00:49:18,496
Calm down!

230
00:49:19,16 --> 00:49:20,497
Calm down!

231
00:49:20,563 --> 00:49:23,497
He can goto some other school!
It’s my job!

232
00:49:23,606 --> 00:49:25,627
I’m the boss here
Settle down!

233
00:49:26,66 --> 00:49:28,213
Okay? Just calm down!

234
00:49:28,276 --> 00:49:30,6
Get up, you big lump

235
00:49:36,327 --> 00:49:38,348
How can I make it any clearer?

236
00:49:38,455 --> 00:49:41,16
It’s only been three days
You can’t do this.

237
00:49:41,124 --> 00:49:43,185
I wish my son
wasn’t a fuckup, but

238
00:49:43,251 --> 00:49:45,355
He messes up
and he gets a job

239
00:49:45,418 --> 00:49:47,315
But I’m out in the street!

240
00:49:47,378 --> 00:49:49,276
Give me that sack

241
00:49:49,464 --> 00:49:52,28
l’ll give you severance pay

242
00:49:52,94 --> 00:49:55,780
- No, I’m staying!
It’ll just be a few weeks

243
00:49:55,848 --> 00:49:58,449
I want a job and a normal life
like everyone else!

244
00:49:58,516 --> 00:50:00,620
That’s enough now
Give me that.

245
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:03,916
Give it to me

246
00:50:04,854 --> 00:50:06,669
Give it to me!

247
00:52:38,717 --> 00:52:41,238
- No, sorry.
Maybe later on?

248
00:52:41,346 --> 00:52:45,75
Anyone on a trial basis?
- We have a waiting list.

249
00:53:52,875 --> 00:53:55,271
If you need help,
you can tell me.

250
00:53:55,376 --> 00:53:56,981
I’m looking for work

251
00:53:57,47 --> 00:53:59,65
We only hire
the long-term unemployed

252
00:53:59,131 --> 00:54:00,901
What about cleaning your offices?

253
00:54:00,966 --> 00:54:03,612
Volunteers do that
I’m sorry.

254
00:54:03,718 --> 00:54:05,241
Good-bye

255
00:54:15,813 --> 00:54:17,170
Thanks.

256
00:54:20,26 --> 00:54:21,798
Thanks. Good-bye

257
00:54:22,362 --> 00:54:24,509
Maybe his son will hate it

258
00:54:24,867 --> 00:54:28,426
Or maybe he’ll hire you for the counter
He has 12 stands.

259
00:54:28,493 --> 00:54:30,224
A waffle, please.

260
00:54:35,958 --> 00:54:37,564
Forty francs

261
00:54:41,7 --> 00:54:43,485
- Here’s 40 francs.
Don’t worry about it

262
00:54:45,177 --> 00:54:47,406
See you tomorrow
- Hold on.

263
00:54:47,471 --> 00:54:49,783
I’m catching the bus
- Hold on!

264
00:54:49,848 --> 00:54:51,827
Wanna come to my place tonight?

265
00:54:51,893 --> 00:54:53,996
Want me to come
by the campground?

266
00:55:02,446 --> 00:55:04,630
You still mean what you said?
- What?

267
00:55:04,698 --> 00:55:08,467
- If a job opens up, it’s mine?
Yeah. But the light’s changed

268
00:55:08,533 --> 00:55:10,513
But will I have a job?

269
00:55:10,578 --> 00:55:13,348
I don’t know.
I can’t say in advance!

270
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:44,922
The entrance
Is on the other side.

271
00:57:45,648 --> 00:57:46,920
What do you want?

272
00:57:46,984 --> 00:57:49,838
If you need money,
I can lend you some

273
00:57:49,948 --> 00:57:52,880
- No need.
You sure? What about the apartment?

274
00:57:53,281 --> 00:57:55,135
I don’t care about the apartment

275
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:56,721
What are you doing?

276
00:57:56,787 --> 00:57:59,221
I thought you were the attendant
I threw my lines in.

277
00:57:59,289 --> 00:58:02,432
- Your what?
My lines, with my trout traps

278
00:58:02,498 --> 00:58:04,187
I caught one

279
00:58:05,167 --> 00:58:06,732
Gimme that

280
00:58:09,922 --> 00:58:11,611
Give me your hand

281
00:58:27,898 --> 00:58:29,629
I’m sinking!

282
00:58:31,68 --> 00:58:32,591
Rosetta!

283
00:58:42,705 --> 00:58:43,978
I’m sinking

284
00:59:15,154 --> 00:59:16,802
Grab hold!

285
00:59:20,576 --> 00:59:22,724
Ouick! I’m sinking!

286
00:59:28,875 --> 00:59:30,524
Ouick!

287
00:59:42,889 --> 00:59:44,413
Pull!

288
01:00:05,329 --> 01:00:06,935
I slipped

289
01:00:47,204 --> 01:00:49,18
Wring it out more

290
01:00:54,923 --> 01:00:57,859
If you want, you can come
dry off at the trailer.

291
01:00:57,924 --> 01:00:59,946
No, l’ll change at home

292
01:02:10,665 --> 01:02:13,601
- Didn’t you see me?
I didn’t think it was open

293
01:02:13,832 --> 01:02:15,646
Want some coffee?

294
01:02:17,502 --> 01:02:19,67
Come on

295
01:02:30,57 --> 01:02:31,580
You coming?

296
01:02:40,67 --> 01:02:41,590
Come inside

297
01:02:42,819 --> 01:02:44,134
Come on

298
01:02:47,617 --> 01:02:49,638
It’s hot.
It’ll do you good

299
01:02:57,420 --> 01:03:00,273
You could make
the batter for my waffles

300
01:03:00,424 --> 01:03:04,67
I sell ten a day.
Comes to 15,000 francs a month

301
01:03:05,50 --> 01:03:06,864
You’d have a job

302
01:03:07,889 --> 01:03:09,949
Working under the counter
isn’t a real job.

303
01:03:10,14 --> 01:03:11,410
At least it’s something

304
01:03:11,473 --> 01:03:12,662
You open?

305
01:03:12,724 --> 01:03:14,330
In five minutes!

306
01:03:15,978 --> 01:03:18,126
You can keep it all

307
01:03:21,567 --> 01:03:23,256
You interested?

308
01:03:25,863 --> 01:03:28,219
No, I want a real job

309
01:04:25,547 --> 01:04:27,70
Is the boss in?

310
01:04:27,134 --> 01:04:29,403
Yeah.
In the back, in his office

311
01:05:20,20 --> 01:05:22,832
I came to see
if you had any news

312
01:05:23,605 --> 01:05:25,462
It’s too soon

313
01:05:25,609 --> 01:05:28,213
I said I’d write you.
I have your address

314
01:05:28,277 --> 01:05:30,633
That’s my old address

315
01:05:33,159 --> 01:05:35,135
Okay.
Give me your new address

316
01:05:37,329 --> 01:05:40,141
The Grand Canyon
- The campground?

317
01:05:41,40 --> 01:05:43,313
252 Floute de Marche

318
01:05:46,837 --> 01:05:48,901
Fliquet’s ripping you off

319
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:50,862
What?

320
01:05:50,925 --> 01:05:52,988
He’s selling his own waffles

321
01:05:53,721 --> 01:05:56,323
- How?
He has a waffle iron at home

322
01:05:57,682 --> 01:06:00,286
How do you know?
- I saw it.

323
01:06:00,601 --> 01:06:02,914
His waffles are under the counter

324
01:06:09,863 --> 01:06:13,632
If I come, he’ll know I told you
- He’ll know anyway.

325
01:06:41,808 --> 01:06:43,373
Hello, boss

326
01:06:47,774 --> 01:06:49,794
Where are they?
- What?

327
01:06:50,318 --> 01:06:52,547
Cut the crap.
Where are they?

328
01:06:54,655 --> 01:06:56,718
Where are your waffles?

329
01:06:57,73 --> 01:06:58,763
Right here

330
01:07:03,830 --> 01:07:05,395
What’s this?

331
01:07:05,958 --> 01:07:07,772
Why’d you do it?

332
01:07:09,503 --> 01:07:11,525
Give me your apron

333
01:07:13,7 --> 01:07:14,988
Come on. Give it to me

334
01:07:26,770 --> 01:07:28,335
Pick it up

335
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:30,753
You owe me three days’ pay

336
01:07:31,319 --> 01:07:33,378
- Go on.
You owe me three days’ pay!

337
01:07:34,153 --> 01:07:35,925
You gonna pick it up?

338
01:07:36,30 --> 01:07:37,843
Pay me my three days!

339
01:07:38,116 --> 01:07:40,971
Get out, you fuckin’ little thief!

340
01:07:43,703 --> 01:07:45,435
Beat it!

341
01:07:55,882 --> 01:07:57,530
Put this on

342
01:10:13,186 --> 01:10:14,709
Let me go!

343
01:10:17,566 --> 01:10:19,505
Why’d you do it?

344
01:10:23,405 --> 01:10:25,428
Go on, hit me!

345
01:10:26,491 --> 01:10:28,347
Why’d you do it?

346
01:10:28,994 --> 01:10:30,975
I wanted a job

347
01:10:45,176 --> 01:10:46,741
Let me by

348
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:55,125
Let me by!

349
01:10:58,275 --> 01:11:00,419
I wasn’t going to help you
out of the water!

350
01:11:00,483 --> 01:11:02,214
But you did!

351
01:11:09,742 --> 01:11:11,473
Let me by

352
