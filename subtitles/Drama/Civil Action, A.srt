3
00:00:39,554 --> 00:00:42,452
NOOOOOOO !!!

4
00:00:42,928 --> 00:00:45,772
NOOOOO !

5
00:00:47,957 --> 00:00:49,459
Longing.

6
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,889
Rusted.

7
00:00:52,914 --> 00:00:54,338
Seventeen.

8
00:00:54,363 --> 00:00:56,065
Daybreak.

9
00:00:56,671 --> 00:00:58,243
Furnace.

10
00:00:59,032 --> 00:01:00,455
Nine.

11
00:01:00,674 --> 00:01:02,612
Benign.

12
00:01:03,262 --> 00:01:05,705
Homecoming.

13
00:01:06,087 --> 00:01:07,779
One.

14
00:01:08,917 --> 00:01:11,045
Freight car.

15
00:01:18,407 --> 00:01:20,359
Good morning, soldier.

16
00:01:22,126 --> 00:01:24,452
I am ready.

17
00:01:24,712 --> 00:01:26,887
I have a mission for you.

18
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,392
Elimination and extraction.

19
00:01:30,417 --> 00:01:32,371
No witnesses.

20
00:02:13,043 --> 00:02:15,138
Well done, soldier.

21
00:02:45,421 --> 00:02:49,573
LAGOS

22
00:02:50,126 --> 00:02:52,890
PRESENT DAY

23
00:02:59,466 --> 00:03:01,430
Alright, what do you see?

24
00:03:01,455 --> 00:03:03,618
Standard beat cops.

25
00:03:04,498 --> 00:03:06,552
A small station.

26
00:03:08,228 --> 00:03:09,931
Quiet street.

27
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:11,470
It's a good target.

28
00:03:11,495 --> 00:03:13,636
There's an ATM in the south corner,
which means...

29
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:14,871
Cameras.

30
00:03:14,896 --> 00:03:16,821
Both cross streets leading one way?

31
00:03:16,846 --> 00:03:19,084
So compromise the escape routes.

32
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:20,787
Means our guy doesn't care
about being seen

33
00:03:20,812 --> 00:03:23,134
he isn't afraid to make a mess
on the way out.

34
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,214
You see that ranger rover
over half way up the block.

35
00:03:25,259 --> 00:03:27,392
You mean the red one.
It's cute.

36
00:03:27,417 --> 00:03:29,935
It's also bullet proof,
which means private security,

37
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,027
which means more guns, which means
more headaches for somebody, probably us.

38
00:03:34,052 --> 00:03:36,451
You guys know I can move things
with my mind, right?

39
00:03:36,475 --> 00:03:39,592
Looking over your shoulder
needs to become a second nature.

40
00:03:39,822 --> 00:03:42,198
Anybody ever tell you,
you're a little paranoid.

41
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:44,573
Not to my face.
Why, did you hear something?

42
00:03:44,598 --> 00:03:46,263
Eyes on target, folks.

43
00:03:46,288 --> 00:03:48,264
The best lead we have on Rumlow
in 6 months.

44
00:03:48,289 --> 00:03:49,562
I don't want to lose him.

45
00:03:49,587 --> 00:03:51,568
Maybe he sees us coming
there won't be a problem,

46
00:03:51,593 --> 00:03:53,710
he kind of hate us.

47
00:03:56,626 --> 00:03:59,519
Sam, see that garbage truck?

48
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,163
Take it.

49
00:04:19,267 --> 00:04:21,070
Give me X-ray.

50
00:04:22,849 --> 00:04:25,417
<font color="#ff8080">MAX CAPACITY</font>

51
00:04:25,442 --> 00:04:28,562
Yeah, the truck's loaded for max weight,
and the driver's armed.

52
00:04:28,587 --> 00:04:30,032
- It's a battling ram.
- Go now.

53
00:04:30,057 --> 00:04:31,329
Where?

54
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,656
He's not aiming the police.

55
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:39,285
INSTITUTE FOR
INFECTIOUS DISEASES

56
00:05:37,033 --> 00:05:39,390
Body armor.
AR15s

57
00:05:39,415 --> 00:05:41,440
I make 7 hostiles.

58
00:05:49,691 --> 00:05:51,642
I make 5.

59
00:05:56,651 --> 00:05:57,996
Sam.

60
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:02,640
4.

61
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,025
Rumlow's on the third floor.

62
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,673
- Wanda. Just like we practice.
- What about the gas?

63
00:06:10,698 --> 00:06:12,168
Get it out.

64
00:06:29,703 --> 00:06:31,389
Pack it up.

65
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,994
He's here.

66
00:07:13,186 --> 00:07:16,173
- Rumlow has a biological weapon.
- I'm on it.

67
00:07:51,136 --> 00:07:53,869
I don't work like that no more.

68
00:07:56,027 --> 00:07:57,994
Fire in the hole.

69
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:30,386
Sam.
He's in the main humvee heading north.

70
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,633
Take this to the extract.

71
00:08:36,658 --> 00:08:39,715
We're not going to out run him.
Lose the truck.

72
00:08:46,394 --> 00:08:49,027
- Where are you going to meet us?
- I'm not.

73
00:09:00,412 --> 00:09:02,593
I got 4,
they're splitting up.

74
00:09:07,024 --> 00:09:09,027
I got the two on the left.

75
00:09:17,217 --> 00:09:18,568
They ditch their gear.

76
00:09:18,593 --> 00:09:21,363
It's a shell game now.
One of them has the payload.

77
00:09:26,221 --> 00:09:28,632
There you are,
you son of a bitch.

78
00:09:29,385 --> 00:09:31,591
I've been waiting for this!

79
00:09:47,852 --> 00:09:49,544
He doesn't have it.

80
00:09:49,844 --> 00:09:51,064
I'm empty.

81
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:53,605
Out of the way!
Out of the way!

82
00:10:31,454 --> 00:10:32,829
Drop it.

83
00:10:33,256 --> 00:10:35,130
Or I'll drop this.

84
00:10:35,878 --> 00:10:38,467
- Drop it!
- He'll do it!

85
00:10:44,912 --> 00:10:46,856
Payload secured.
Thanks, Sam.

86
00:10:46,881 --> 00:10:48,419
Don't thank me.

87
00:10:48,444 --> 00:10:51,012
- I'm not thanking that thing.
- His name is Redwing.

88
00:10:51,036 --> 00:10:54,127
- I'm still not thanking it.
- He's cute.

89
00:11:00,352 --> 00:11:01,840
Come on!

90
00:11:09,609 --> 00:11:12,633
This is for dropping
a building on my face.

91
00:11:33,868 --> 00:11:35,741
I think it look pretty good,
all things considered.

92
00:11:35,766 --> 00:11:37,289
Who's your buyer?

93
00:11:37,314 --> 00:11:39,212
He knew we knew you.

94
00:11:39,236 --> 00:11:41,921
You pal, your buddy,
your Bucky.

95
00:11:43,006 --> 00:11:45,808
- What did you say?
- He remembered you.

96
00:11:46,155 --> 00:11:49,488
I was there.
He got all weepy about it.

97
00:11:50,231 --> 00:11:52,916
Till they put put his brain
back in the blender.

98
00:11:52,941 --> 00:11:54,837
He wanted you to know something.

99
00:11:54,862 --> 00:11:56,286
He said to me,

100
00:11:56,311 --> 00:11:58,448
"Please tell Rogers,"

101
00:11:59,099 --> 00:12:02,620
"When you got to go,
you got to go."

102
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,852
And you're coming with me.

103
00:12:22,822 --> 00:12:24,293
Oh my...

104
00:12:27,105 --> 00:12:29,804
Sam.
We need...

105
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:33,771
Fire and rescue,
on the south side of the building.

106
00:12:33,796 --> 00:12:35,511
We got to get up here.

107
00:12:41,968 --> 00:12:48,583
Try to remember
the kind of September

108
00:12:48,607 --> 00:12:53,622
When grass was green...

109
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:56,193
Wake up, dear.
Say goodbye to your father.

110
00:12:56,218 --> 00:12:58,648
Who's the homeless person
on the couch?

111
00:12:59,372 --> 00:13:01,490
This is why I love
coming over for Christmas.

112
00:13:01,515 --> 00:13:02,913
Right before you leave town.

113
00:13:02,938 --> 00:13:05,333
Be nice, dear.
He's been studying abroad.

114
00:13:05,358 --> 00:13:07,469
Really, which broad?
What's her name?

115
00:13:07,494 --> 00:13:08,918
Candice.

116
00:13:09,215 --> 00:13:11,953
Do me a favour. Try not to burn
the house down before Monday.

117
00:13:11,978 --> 00:13:13,197
Okay, so it's Monday.

118
00:13:13,221 --> 00:13:17,254
That is good to know.
I will plan my totem party accordingly.

119
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,475
Where're you going?

120
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:21,061
You father's flying us to the Bahamas
for a little get away.

121
00:13:21,086 --> 00:13:22,745
We might have to make a
quick stop.

122
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,995
At the Pentagon.
Right?

123
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:28,120
Don't worry. You're going to love
the holiday menu at the commissure.

124
00:13:28,145 --> 00:13:31,059
You know, they say sarcasm
is a metric for potential.

125
00:13:31,084 --> 00:13:33,028
If that's true,
you'll be a great man some day.

126
00:13:33,053 --> 00:13:34,684
I'll get the bags.

127
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,717
He does miss you
when you are not here.

128
00:13:40,838 --> 00:13:44,891
And frankly,
you're going to miss us.

129
00:13:45,143 --> 00:13:48,632
Because this is the last time
we're all going to be together.

130
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:51,884
You know what's about to happen.

131
00:13:52,445 --> 00:13:56,159
Say something.
If you don't, you'll regret it.

132
00:13:59,516 --> 00:14:01,112
I love you, Dad.

133
00:14:02,237 --> 00:14:04,533
And I knew you did
the best you could.

134
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,349
That's how I wished it happened.

135
00:14:24,593 --> 00:14:26,392
By merely augmented

136
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:28,442
retro framing or "BARF".

137
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,197
God, I got to work on that acronym.

138
00:14:30,222 --> 00:14:35,231
An extremely costly method,
of hijacking the hippocampus

139
00:14:35,387 --> 00:14:39,935
to clear... traumatic memories.

140
00:14:43,193 --> 00:14:46,610
It doesn't change the fact that
they never made it to the airport,

141
00:14:47,015 --> 00:14:50,209
or the things I did
to avoid processing my grief.

142
00:14:51,969 --> 00:14:56,821
Plus, 611 million dollars for
my little therapeutic experiment.

143
00:14:58,311 --> 00:15:01,436
No one in the right mind
would ever funded it.

144
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,054
Help me out. 
What's the MIT admission statement.

145
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:09,695
To generate, disseminate
and preserve knowledge,

146
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,376
and work with others,

147
00:15:11,401 --> 00:15:14,605
to bring to bear on the
world's great challenges.

148
00:15:15,245 --> 00:15:18,999
Well, you,
or the others.

149
00:15:19,437 --> 00:15:22,478
And quite as it kept
the challenges facing you

150
00:15:22,503 --> 00:15:24,356
are the greatest mankind
has ever known.

151
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,827
Plus, most of you are broke.

152
00:15:26,852 --> 00:15:28,910
also, I rather you work.

153
00:15:28,935 --> 00:15:32,707
As of this moment, every student
has been made an equal recipient

154
00:15:32,735 --> 00:15:35,973
of the Inaugural September Foundation Grant.

155
00:15:35,998 --> 00:15:40,770
As in, all of your projects have
just been approved and funded.

156
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,216
No strings.
No taxes.

157
00:15:45,241 --> 00:15:48,636
Just... reframe the future.

158
00:15:48,705 --> 00:15:50,384
Starting now.

159
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,098
Go break some eggs.

160
00:16:11,314 --> 00:16:14,543
That uh...
That took my breathe away.

161
00:16:14,568 --> 00:16:17,025
Tony, so generous,
so much money.

162
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:20,284
Wow! I...
Out of curiosity and...

163
00:16:20,309 --> 00:16:23,158
Will any portion of that grant be
made available to faculty?

164
00:16:23,182 --> 00:16:24,652
I know, ooo, gross,
but hear me out.

165
00:16:24,677 --> 00:16:26,814
I have got this killer idea
for a self cooking hotdog.

166
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:28,202
Basically, chemical detonator embedded...

167
00:16:28,227 --> 00:16:30,581
- The Restroom this way, yeah?
- Yeah. Embedding in the meat shaft.

168
00:16:30,606 --> 00:16:32,815
Mr. Stark, I am so sorry
about the telepromter.

169
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,805
I didn't know Miss Potts has canceled.
They didn't have time to fix it.

170
00:16:35,831 --> 00:16:40,063
It's... fine.
I'll be right back.

171
00:16:40,088 --> 00:16:41,750
We'll catch up later.

172
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:02,415
That was really sweet,
what you did for the young people.

173
00:17:02,531 --> 00:17:04,468
Oh, they deserve it.

174
00:17:04,628 --> 00:17:06,869
'Cos it helps to ease my conscious.

175
00:17:07,346 --> 00:17:12,113
They say, there's a correlation
between generosity and guilt.

176
00:17:12,877 --> 00:17:15,718
But, you got the money.

177
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,583
Break as many eggs as you like.

178
00:17:19,278 --> 00:17:20,700
It's brilliant.

179
00:17:29,396 --> 00:17:30,809
Are you going up?

180
00:17:30,834 --> 00:17:33,297
I'm right where I wanted to be.

181
00:17:33,642 --> 00:17:35,415
Okay, okay.
Hey!

182
00:17:37,898 --> 00:17:41,052
I'm sorry.
It's my occupation hazard.

183
00:17:41,077 --> 00:17:45,387
I work for the State department.
Human resources.

184
00:17:45,412 --> 00:17:47,146
I know it's boring.

185
00:17:47,664 --> 00:17:51,169
But, it enabled me to raise a son.

186
00:17:51,781 --> 00:17:55,478
I'm very proud
of what he grew up to be.

187
00:17:56,687 --> 00:17:59,291
His name was Charlie Spencer.

188
00:18:01,697 --> 00:18:03,626
Your murdered him.

189
00:18:04,412 --> 00:18:06,375
In Sokovia.

190
00:18:07,729 --> 00:18:10,720
Not that it matters
in the least to you.

191
00:18:12,497 --> 00:18:15,382
You think you fight for us.

192
00:18:15,818 --> 00:18:18,278
You just fight for yourself.

193
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:23,741
Who's going to avenge my son, Stark?

194
00:18:24,323 --> 00:18:28,383
He's dead.
And I blame you.

195
00:18:36,638 --> 00:18:39,746
11 Wakandans were among those killed
during a confrontation

196
00:18:39,771 --> 00:18:42,058
between the Avengers
and a group of mercenaries

197
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:44,231
in Lagos, Nigeria, last month.

198
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,152
The traditionally reclusive Wakandans

199
00:18:46,155 --> 00:18:49,412
were on an outreach mission in Lagos
when the attack occurred.

200
00:18:49,437 --> 00:18:53,362
Our people's blood is spilled
on foreign soil.

201
00:18:53,387 --> 00:18:56,570
Not only the cause of
the actions are criminals,

202
00:18:56,598 --> 00:19:00,363
but by the indifference of those
pledge to stop them.

203
00:19:00,388 --> 00:19:05,862
Victory at the expense of the innocent,
is no victory at all.

204
00:19:05,887 --> 00:19:08,485
The Wakanda king went on to...

205
00:19:14,097 --> 00:19:16,739
What legal authority does
an enhanced individual

206
00:19:16,764 --> 00:19:20,526
like Wanda Maximoff have
to operate in Nigeria?

207
00:19:24,318 --> 00:19:26,625
- It's my fault.
- That's no true.

208
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:30,340
Then turn the TV back on,
you're being very specific.

209
00:19:30,365 --> 00:19:34,005
I should've grabbed that bomb
as I'm the leader to deal with it.

210
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:37,114
Rumlow said 'Bucky' and...

211
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:41,383
All of a sudden, I was
a 16 year old kid again in Brooklyn.

212
00:19:45,635 --> 00:19:47,110
People died.

213
00:19:49,452 --> 00:19:53,007
- It's on me.
- It's on both of us.

214
00:19:53,397 --> 00:19:55,088
This job...

215
00:19:57,966 --> 00:20:00,712
We try to save as
many people as we can.

216
00:20:00,736 --> 00:20:02,593
Sometimes that doesn't mean everybody,

217
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,730
but, if we can find a way 
to live with that,

218
00:20:04,756 --> 00:20:06,492
Next time...

219
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:10,156
maybe who we can save.

220
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:15,805
Vis, we talked about this.

221
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:18,883
Yes. But the door was opened
so I assumed...

222
00:20:20,515 --> 00:20:23,594
Captain Rogers wished to know
when Mr. Stark was arriving.

223
00:20:23,619 --> 00:20:25,564
Thank you.
I'll be right down.

224
00:20:25,589 --> 00:20:28,411
I'll... use the door.

225
00:20:28,575 --> 00:20:31,040
Oh, and apparently,
he's brought a guest.

226
00:20:31,065 --> 00:20:32,802
You know who it is?

227
00:20:33,071 --> 00:20:35,095
The secretary of State.

228
00:20:38,128 --> 00:20:42,127
Oh. 5 years ago,
I had a heart attack.

229
00:20:42,263 --> 00:20:45,671
I dropped right in the middle
of my batting swing.

230
00:20:46,061 --> 00:20:48,074
Turned out, it was the
best round of my life

231
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:52,999
because after 13 hours of surgery
and a triple bypass.

232
00:20:53,561 --> 00:20:58,034
I found something 40 years
in the army never taught me:

233
00:20:58,059 --> 00:21:00,067
Perspective.

234
00:21:01,065 --> 00:21:05,469
The world owes the Avengers
an unpayable debt.

235
00:21:06,177 --> 00:21:09,352
You've... fought for us.

236
00:21:09,377 --> 00:21:12,735
Protected us.
Risked your lives.

237
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,763
While a great many people
see you as heroes.

238
00:21:16,806 --> 00:21:18,728
There are some...

239
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:21,977
would prefer the word "vigilantes."

240
00:21:22,002 --> 00:21:24,721
And what word would you use,
Mr. Secretary.

241
00:21:24,746 --> 00:21:26,486
How about "Dangerous?"

242
00:21:26,511 --> 00:21:31,717
What would you call a group of
US-based, enhanced individuals,

243
00:21:31,742 --> 00:21:36,690
who routinely ignores sovereign borders
and inflict their will

244
00:21:36,715 --> 00:21:39,549
wherever they choose
and who, frankly,

245
00:21:39,574 --> 00:21:42,954
seem unconcerned about
what they leave behind them.

246
00:21:46,817 --> 00:21:48,476
New York.

247
00:22:02,376 --> 00:22:04,578
Washington DC.

248
00:22:12,543 --> 00:22:14,356
Sokovia.

249
00:22:24,796 --> 00:22:26,385
Lagos.

250
00:22:34,846 --> 00:22:37,242
Okay.
That's enough.

251
00:22:38,749 --> 00:22:43,069
For the past 4 years, you operated
with unlimited power and no supervision.

252
00:22:43,094 --> 00:22:47,710
That's an arrangement the governments
of the world can no longer tolerate.

253
00:22:49,831 --> 00:22:52,293
But I think we have a solution.

254
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:58,558
The Sokovia accords.

255
00:22:58,642 --> 00:23:01,767
Approved by 117 countries.

256
00:23:01,792 --> 00:23:07,434
It states, that the Avengers shall
no longer be a private organization.

257
00:23:07,459 --> 00:23:13,105
Instead, they'll operate under the
supervision of a United Nations Panel,

258
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:18,794
only when and if that Panel
deems it necessary.

259
00:23:18,819 --> 00:23:22,043
The Avengers were formed
to make the world a safer place.

260
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:23,836
I feel we've done that.

261
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:28,625
Tell me captain, do you know where
Thor and Banner are right now?

262
00:23:28,854 --> 00:23:31,537
If I misplaced a couple of
30 mega tonne nukes,

263
00:23:31,562 --> 00:23:34,245
you can bet there'd be consequences

264
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:38,516
Compromise. Reassurance.
That's how the world works.

265
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:42,598
Believe me, this is the middle ground.

266
00:23:42,734 --> 00:23:45,554
So, there are contingencies

267
00:23:45,579 --> 00:23:50,249
3 days from now, the UN meets
in Vienna to ratify the Accords.

268
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:54,346
So, talk it over.

269
00:23:57,553 --> 00:24:00,994
And if we come to
a decision you don't like?

270
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:03,717
Then you retire.

271
00:24:09,363 --> 00:24:13,176
CLEVELAND

272
00:24:26,485 --> 00:24:27,903
Hello?

273
00:24:29,251 --> 00:24:31,397
Is this your car out front?

274
00:24:32,965 --> 00:24:34,887
I jumped the curb.

275
00:24:36,362 --> 00:24:39,475
Maybe we could,
take care of it ourselves.

276
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,284
If you prefer to call the cops,
then, that's okay too, I guess.

277
00:24:42,309 --> 00:24:43,627
No.

278
00:24:44,967 --> 00:24:46,626
No cops.

279
00:24:47,511 --> 00:24:48,909
Thank you.

280
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:27,768
You kept your looks, colonel.

281
00:25:28,478 --> 00:25:30,537
Congratulations.

282
00:25:33,421 --> 00:25:37,699
Mission report: December 16, 1991

283
00:25:37,724 --> 00:25:39,422
Who are you?

284
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:42,011
My name is Zemo.

285
00:25:43,287 --> 00:25:45,771
I will repeat my question.

286
00:25:45,998 --> 00:25:51,209
Mission report. 
December 16, 1991

287
00:25:51,234 --> 00:25:52,672
How did you find me?

288
00:25:52,697 --> 00:25:54,913
When SHIELD fell,

289
00:25:55,216 --> 00:25:58,479
Black widow released
HYDRA files to the public.

290
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:01,494
Millions of pages
much of it encrypted,

291
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:03,320
not easy to decipher.

292
00:26:03,345 --> 00:26:04,757
But,

293
00:26:06,638 --> 00:26:08,615
I have experience.

294
00:26:09,298 --> 00:26:11,208
And patience.

295
00:26:12,348 --> 00:26:15,062
A man can do anything
if he has those.

296
00:26:15,528 --> 00:26:17,227
What do you want?

297
00:26:17,888 --> 00:26:23,994
Mission report.
December 16, 1991

298
00:26:24,019 --> 00:26:27,519
Go to hell.

299
00:26:41,596 --> 00:26:44,632
HYDRA deserves its place
on the ashtray,

300
00:26:44,657 --> 00:26:47,369
so your death would not bother me.

301
00:26:47,622 --> 00:26:49,863
But I have to use this book,

302
00:26:49,888 --> 00:26:53,546
and other bloodier methods
to find what I need.

303
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:55,911
I don't look forward to that.

304
00:26:57,203 --> 00:27:01,316
You know, maybe you're dying for...
your pride.

305
00:27:15,883 --> 00:27:18,839
Hail, HYDRA.

306
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,760
Secretary Ross, has a Congressional Medal of Honor,
which is 1 more than you have.

307
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:35,347
So, let's say we agree to this thing.

308
00:27:35,372 --> 00:27:37,242
How long is it gonna be
before they lo-jack us

309
00:27:37,267 --> 00:27:38,576
like a bunch of common criminals?

310
00:27:38,601 --> 00:27:41,142
A 117 countries want to sign this.

311
00:27:41,167 --> 00:27:43,381
117, Sam, and you're just like,
"No, it's cool."

312
00:27:43,406 --> 00:27:44,855
How long are you
going to play both sides?

313
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,443
- I have an equation.
- Oh, this will clear it up.

314
00:27:48,655 --> 00:27:51,788
In the 8 years since Mr. Stark
announced himself as Iron Man,

315
00:27:51,813 --> 00:27:56,320
the number of noted enhanced persons
has grown exponentially.

316
00:27:56,345 --> 00:27:58,534
And during the same period,

317
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,586
the number of potentially
world-ending events

318
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:02,413
has risen at a commissive rate.

319
00:28:02,439 --> 00:28:04,100
Are you saying it's our fault?

320
00:28:04,124 --> 00:28:06,932
I'm saying there maybe a causality.

321
00:28:08,574 --> 00:28:11,240
Our very strength invites challenge.

322
00:28:11,265 --> 00:28:14,154
Challenge incites conflict.

323
00:28:14,179 --> 00:28:19,709
And conflict... breeds catastrophe.

324
00:28:20,047 --> 00:28:21,824
Oversight.

325
00:28:23,729 --> 00:28:26,779
Oversight is not an idea that
could be dismissed out-of-hand.

326
00:28:26,804 --> 00:28:28,072
Boom.

327
00:28:28,247 --> 00:28:32,724
Tony, you're being
uncharacteristically non-hyper verbal.

328
00:28:32,749 --> 00:28:34,261
That's because he's already
made up his mind.

329
00:28:34,286 --> 00:28:36,078
Boy, you know me so well.

330
00:28:37,306 --> 00:28:40,531
Actually, I'm nursing my
electromagnetic headache.

331
00:28:40,556 --> 00:28:41,791
That's what's going on, Cap.

332
00:28:41,816 --> 00:28:46,026
It's just pain...
says Humphrey.

333
00:28:46,051 --> 00:28:48,795
Who's putting coffee grounds
in the disposal?

334
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:51,711
Am I running a bed and breakfast
for a biker gang?

335
00:28:57,681 --> 00:29:00,255
Oh, that's Charles Spencer by the way.

336
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,608
He's a great kid.
Computer engineering degree.

337
00:29:02,633 --> 00:29:05,304
3.6 GPA.

338
00:29:07,435 --> 00:29:10,026
But first, he wanted to
put a few miles on his soul.

339
00:29:10,053 --> 00:29:11,837
Before he park and prime
in a desk.

340
00:29:11,862 --> 00:29:14,663
See the world and
maybe be of service.

341
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,735
Charlie didn't want to go to Vegas
which is what I would do.

342
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,043
He didn't go to Paris or Amsterdam.
Sounds fun.

343
00:29:21,068 --> 00:29:24,527
He decided to spend his summer,
building sustainable housing for the poor.

344
00:29:24,552 --> 00:29:26,683
Guess where, Sokovia.

345
00:29:30,167 --> 00:29:32,229
He want to make a difference, I suppose.
I mean, we won't know

346
00:29:32,254 --> 00:29:35,808
because we dropped a building on him
while we were kicking ass.

347
00:29:43,343 --> 00:29:45,872
There's no decision making process here.

348
00:29:47,617 --> 00:29:49,281
We need to be put in check.

349
00:29:49,306 --> 00:29:51,438
Whatever form that takes, I'm game.

350
00:29:51,463 --> 00:29:53,472
If we can't accept limitations,
we're bounderless,

351
00:29:53,497 --> 00:29:56,016
we're no better than the bad guys.

352
00:29:56,048 --> 00:29:58,616
Tony, someone dies on you watch,
you don't give up.

353
00:29:58,641 --> 00:29:59,787
Who said we're giving up?

354
00:29:59,812 --> 00:30:02,446
We are, for not taking responsibility
for our actions.

355
00:30:02,471 --> 00:30:06,078
- These documents just shifts the blames.
- Sorry. Steve, that...

356
00:30:06,103 --> 00:30:07,756
That is dangerously arrogant.

357
00:30:07,781 --> 00:30:09,845
This is the United Nations
we're talking about.

358
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:13,612
It's not the world security council,
it's not SHIELD, it's not HYDRA.

359
00:30:13,637 --> 00:30:16,460
No, but it's run by people with agendas
and agendas change.

360
00:30:16,485 --> 00:30:18,409
That's good.
That's why I'm here.

361
00:30:18,434 --> 00:30:21,451
When I realized what my weapons
were capable of in the wrong hands,

362
00:30:21,476 --> 00:30:22,810
I shut it down and
stop manufacturing them.

363
00:30:22,835 --> 00:30:25,496
Tony.
You chose to do that.

364
00:30:25,521 --> 00:30:28,915
If we sign these,
we surrender our right to choose.

365
00:30:29,388 --> 00:30:31,781
What if this Panel sends us somewhere
we don't think we should go.

366
00:30:31,806 --> 00:30:34,714
What if it's somewhere we need to go,
and they don't let us.

367
00:30:34,739 --> 00:30:37,867
We may not be perfect,
but the safest hands are still our own.

368
00:30:37,892 --> 00:30:42,416
If we don't do this now,
it's going to be done to us later.

369
00:30:42,441 --> 00:30:44,105
That's a fact.
That won't be pretty.

370
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:47,115
- You're saying they will come for me.
- We will protect you.

371
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,028
Maybe Tony is right.

372
00:30:50,051 --> 00:30:54,350
If, we have one hand on the wheel
that can still steer.

373
00:30:54,711 --> 00:30:58,087
Aren't you the same woman who told
the government to kiss our ass a few years ago.

374
00:30:58,112 --> 00:31:01,017
I'm just...
monitoring.

375
00:31:01,042 --> 00:31:04,425
We have made
some very public mistakes.

376
00:31:04,457 --> 00:31:06,624
We need to win our trust back.

377
00:31:06,649 --> 00:31:09,460
I'm sorry, did I just mishear you or
did you agree with me.

378
00:31:09,485 --> 00:31:12,036
- Oh, I want to take it back.
- No, no, no. You can't retract it.

379
00:31:12,061 --> 00:31:14,732
Thank you.
I'm impress by what you did.

380
00:31:14,801 --> 00:31:16,501
Okay, case close.

381
00:31:16,526 --> 00:31:18,631
- I win.
- [She's gone. In her sleep.]

382
00:31:18,656 --> 00:31:20,400
I have to go.

383
00:31:33,317 --> 00:31:36,663
LONDON

384
00:31:55,838 --> 00:32:00,997
<font color="#ffff80">MARGARET "PEGGY" CARTER</font>

385
00:32:01,926 --> 00:32:03,218
And now,

386
00:32:03,243 --> 00:32:08,501
I would like to invite Sharon Carter,
to come up and say a few words.

387
00:32:20,886 --> 00:32:24,570
Margaret Carter was known to most
as a founder of SHIELD.

388
00:32:25,116 --> 00:32:27,969
But I just knew her
as Aunt Peggy.

389
00:32:29,487 --> 00:32:31,608
She had a photograph in her office.

390
00:32:31,633 --> 00:32:35,065
Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK.

391
00:32:35,607 --> 00:32:37,635
As a kid, that was pretty cool.

392
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,892
But, it was a lot to live up to.

393
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:43,234
Which is why I never
told anyone we were related.

394
00:32:43,892 --> 00:32:48,117
I asked her once how she managed
to master diplomacy and espionage

395
00:32:48,142 --> 00:32:52,923
at a time when no one wanted
to see a woman succeed at either.

396
00:32:52,948 --> 00:32:55,800
And she said,
compromise when you can.

397
00:32:55,825 --> 00:32:59,311
When you can't, don't.

398
00:32:59,809 --> 00:33:05,726
Even if everyone is telling you that
something wrong is something right.

399
00:33:05,751 --> 00:33:08,929
Even if the whole world
is telling you to move.

400
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:12,942
It is your duty,
to plant yourself like a tree,

401
00:33:12,967 --> 00:33:15,703
look them in they eye
and say, " No...

402
00:33:15,728 --> 00:33:17,592
... you move.

403
00:33:28,901 --> 00:33:31,211
When I came out of the ice,

404
00:33:31,236 --> 00:33:33,742
thought I wanted to ignore
she was gone.

405
00:33:34,257 --> 00:33:36,811
When I found out she was alive,

406
00:33:37,672 --> 00:33:39,622
it is just lucky to have her.

407
00:33:39,647 --> 00:33:42,134
She'd have you're back too.

408
00:33:43,666 --> 00:33:45,714
Who else sign it.

409
00:33:45,739 --> 00:33:49,183
Tone, Rhodey,
Vision.

410
00:33:49,593 --> 00:33:51,236
Clint?

411
00:33:51,377 --> 00:33:52,960
Says he's retired.

412
00:33:52,985 --> 00:33:55,712
- Wanda?
- TBD. (To Be Determined)

413
00:33:56,244 --> 00:33:59,236
I'm off to Vienna
for the signing of the Accords.

414
00:33:59,261 --> 00:34:01,686
There is plenty of room 
on the jet.

415
00:34:04,738 --> 00:34:10,053
Just because it's the path of least resistance
does mean it's the wrong path.

416
00:34:10,078 --> 00:34:13,319
Staying together is more important
than how we stay together.

417
00:34:14,004 --> 00:34:16,091
What are we giving up to do it?

418
00:34:20,282 --> 00:34:23,811
Sorry, Nat.
I can't sign it.

419
00:34:24,752 --> 00:34:26,392
I know.

420
00:34:28,339 --> 00:34:30,177
Well, then.
What are you doing here?

421
00:34:32,601 --> 00:34:34,778
I didn't want you to be alone.

422
00:34:41,577 --> 00:34:42,864
Come here.

423
00:34:44,967 --> 00:34:48,140
VIENNA

424
00:34:48,174 --> 00:34:51,197
At a specially United Nations congress,

425
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:57,200
117 countries have come together
to ratify Sokokia Accords.

426
00:35:00,777 --> 00:35:02,323
- Excuse me, Miss Romanoff?
- Yes.

427
00:35:02,348 --> 00:35:04,329
I just need your signature.

428
00:35:05,535 --> 00:35:07,150
Thank you.

429
00:35:07,962 --> 00:35:11,565
I suppose neither of us
is used to the spot light.

430
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:14,796
Well.
It's not always so flattering.

431
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:17,790
You seem to be doing alright so far.

432
00:35:17,814 --> 00:35:20,148
Considering your last trip to Capitol Hill.

433
00:35:20,189 --> 00:35:23,654
I wouldn't think you would be
particularly comfortable in this company.

434
00:35:23,678 --> 00:35:25,139
Well, I'm not.

435
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:28,045
That alone, makes me glad you're here,
Miss Romanoff.

436
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,649
Why?
You don't approve of all this?

437
00:35:29,674 --> 00:35:33,644
The Accords, yes.
The politics, not really.

438
00:35:33,669 --> 00:35:37,350
Two people, in a room,
can get more done than a 100.

439
00:35:37,375 --> 00:35:39,995
Unless you need to move a piano.

440
00:35:40,019 --> 00:35:42,154
- Father.
- Son.

441
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,966
- Miss. Romanoff.
- King T'Chaka.

442
00:35:43,991 --> 00:35:47,636
Please, allow me to apologize
for what happened in Nigeria.

443
00:35:47,661 --> 00:35:49,288
Thank you.

444
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,682
Thank you for agreeing to all this.

445
00:35:51,707 --> 00:35:55,357
I'm sad to hear that Captain Rogers
will not be joining us today.

446
00:35:55,382 --> 00:35:57,629
Yes, so am I.
- Everyone, please be seated.

447
00:35:57,654 --> 00:36:00,172
This assembly is now in session.

448
00:36:00,707 --> 00:36:02,914
That is the future calling.

449
00:36:03,769 --> 00:36:05,131
Such a pleasure.

450
00:36:05,156 --> 00:36:06,672
Thank you.

451
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:11,821
For a man
who disapproves of diplomacy...

452
00:36:11,846 --> 00:36:13,990
You're getting better each time.

453
00:36:14,015 --> 00:36:16,513
I'm happy, father.

454
00:36:24,386 --> 00:36:29,859
When a stolen Wakandan vibranium was
used to make a terrible weapon,

455
00:36:29,884 --> 00:36:34,349
we, in Wakanda, were force
to question our legacy.

456
00:36:34,374 --> 00:36:38,571
Those men and women killed in Nigeria,
were part of a good will mission

457
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:42,073
from a country too long
in the shuttles.

458
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:46,529
We will not, however,
let misfortune drive us back.

459
00:36:46,554 --> 00:36:50,718
We will fight to improve the world
we wish to join.

460
00:36:50,743 --> 00:36:55,465
I am grateful to the Avengers
for supporting this initiative.

461
00:36:56,632 --> 00:37:00,592
Wakanda is proud to extend
it's hand in peace.

462
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:02,906
EVERYBODY GET DOWN !

463
00:37:37,041 --> 00:37:39,921
My mom tried to talk me
on enlisting, but...

464
00:37:39,946 --> 00:37:41,381
not aunt Peggy.

465
00:37:41,406 --> 00:37:43,978
She brought me
my first knife holster.

466
00:37:44,003 --> 00:37:47,572
- Very practical.
- And stylish.

467
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,095
CIA has you stationed over here now?

468
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:58,652
- In Berlin, joint terrorist and task force.
- Right.

469
00:37:58,677 --> 00:38:01,515
- Sounds fun.
- I know, right?

470
00:38:04,113 --> 00:38:06,449
I've been meaning to ask you.

471
00:38:06,474 --> 00:38:09,421
When you were spying on me
from across the hall...

472
00:38:09,446 --> 00:38:11,957
You mean when I was
doing my job?

473
00:38:14,128 --> 00:38:15,880
Did Peggy know?

474
00:38:17,702 --> 00:38:19,931
She kept so many secrets.

475
00:38:20,541 --> 00:38:22,882
I didn't want her to
have to remember you.

476
00:38:26,468 --> 00:38:29,605
- Thanks for walking me back.
- Sure.

477
00:38:32,848 --> 00:38:36,234
Steve.
There's something you got to see.

478
00:38:36,259 --> 00:38:38,148
A bomb hidden in a news van

479
00:38:38,173 --> 00:38:40,389
... blast through the UN building in Vienna.
- Who's coordinating?

480
00:38:40,414 --> 00:38:43,822
More than 70 people have been injured.
At least 12 are dead.

481
00:38:43,847 --> 00:38:46,447
Including Wakanda's King T'Chaka.

482
00:38:46,471 --> 00:38:48,755
Officials have released a video
of a suspect,

483
00:38:48,779 --> 00:38:52,564
identified as James Buchanan Barnes,
the Winter soldier.

484
00:38:52,589 --> 00:38:55,709
The infamous HYDRA agent,
linked to numerous acts of terrorism

485
00:38:55,734 --> 00:38:57,509
and political assassinations.

486
00:38:57,534 --> 00:38:59,392
I have to go to work.

487
00:39:20,994 --> 00:39:22,827
I'm very sorry.

488
00:39:28,974 --> 00:39:34,161
In my culture,
death, is not the end.

489
00:39:35,377 --> 00:39:38,803
It's more of a...
stepping off point.

490
00:39:39,556 --> 00:39:43,343
You reach out with both hands
and bask... and seek amend.

491
00:39:43,377 --> 00:39:46,472
They lead you away into 
the green valleys where...

492
00:39:47,241 --> 00:39:49,122
you can run forever.

493
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:52,756
That sounds very peaceful.

494
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:55,615
My father thought so.

495
00:39:57,094 --> 00:39:59,541
I am not my father.

496
00:39:59,566 --> 00:40:01,216
T'Challa.

497
00:40:01,241 --> 00:40:04,546
The task force will decide
who brings in Barnes.

498
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,318
Don't bother, Miss. Romanoff.

499
00:40:09,228 --> 00:40:11,449
I'll kill him myself.

500
00:40:17,684 --> 00:40:19,390
- Yeah?
- Are you alright?

501
00:40:19,415 --> 00:40:23,056
Ah, yeah, thanks.
I got lucky.

502
00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:32,467
I know how much Barnes mean to you.
I really do.

503
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:34,812
Stay at home.

504
00:40:34,837 --> 00:40:38,846
You'll only make this worse
for all of us. Please.

505
00:40:38,871 --> 00:40:41,616
- Are you saying you'll arrest me?
- No.

506
00:40:42,892 --> 00:40:46,034
Someone will, if you interfere.
That's how it works now.

507
00:40:46,059 --> 00:40:48,100
If he's this far gone, then...

508
00:40:48,125 --> 00:40:49,495
I should be the one
to bring him in.

509
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,519
Why?

510
00:40:50,551 --> 00:40:53,265
Because I'm the one
least likely to die trying.

511
00:40:55,392 --> 00:40:56,956
Shit.

512
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:02,670
Did she tell you
to stay out of it?

513
00:41:04,349 --> 00:41:06,754
- Might have a point.
- He'd do it for me.

514
00:41:06,779 --> 00:41:08,359
1945, maybe.

515
00:41:08,384 --> 00:41:11,264
I just want to make sure
we considered all our options.

516
00:41:11,289 --> 00:41:15,378
The people that shoot at you,
usually wind up shooting at me.

517
00:41:17,005 --> 00:41:19,723
Tips have been pouring in
since the footage went public.

518
00:41:19,748 --> 00:41:22,234
Everybody thinks the Winter soldier
goes to their gym.

519
00:41:22,259 --> 00:41:25,725
Most of it is noise,
except for this.

520
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:29,709
My boss expects a briefing and
he pretty much knows, so...

521
00:41:29,734 --> 00:41:31,776
that's all the answer
you're going to get.

522
00:41:31,965 --> 00:41:34,865
- Thank you.
- And you're going to have to hurry.

523
00:41:35,152 --> 00:41:37,668
We have orders to shoot on sight.

524
00:42:07,677 --> 00:42:10,906
Mr. Muller
I brought breakfast.

525
00:42:14,885 --> 00:42:17,180
I could smell it before opening the door.
Thank you.

526
00:42:17,205 --> 00:42:19,901
Bacon and black coffee.
Again.

527
00:42:19,926 --> 00:42:21,636
I can fix you something different,
if you like.

528
00:42:21,661 --> 00:42:23,040
It's okay.
This is wonderful.

529
00:42:23,065 --> 00:42:24,406
- I'll put this in the...
- No, no, no.

530
00:42:24,431 --> 00:42:27,009
I'll do it. I'll do it.
Don't worry.

531
00:42:50,115 --> 00:42:54,291
BUCHAREST

532
00:43:59,798 --> 00:44:00,970
Heads up, Cap.

533
00:44:00,995 --> 00:44:03,690
German special forces
approaching from the south.

534
00:44:04,096 --> 00:44:05,683
Understood.

535
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,918
Do you know me?

536
00:44:18,278 --> 00:44:19,991
You're Steve.

537
00:44:20,585 --> 00:44:22,653
I read about you at the museum.

538
00:44:22,678 --> 00:44:24,638
They've set the perimeter.

539
00:44:26,055 --> 00:44:27,951
I know you're nervous.

540
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,250
And you have plenty of reason to be.

541
00:44:31,192 --> 00:44:32,992
But you're lying.

542
00:44:33,807 --> 00:44:35,825
I wasn't in Vienna.
I don't do that anymore.

543
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:37,175
They're entering the building.

544
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,939
Well, the people who think
you did are coming here now.

545
00:44:39,964 --> 00:44:41,713
And they're not planning
on taking you alive.

546
00:44:41,738 --> 00:44:45,301
That's smart.
Good strategy.

547
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:48,563
They're on the roof.
I'm compromised.

548
00:44:51,038 --> 00:44:53,606
This doesn't have end in a fight, Buck.

549
00:44:58,094 --> 00:45:00,679
- It always ends in a fight.
- 5 seconds.

550
00:45:00,704 --> 00:45:04,510
You pulled me from the river.
Why?

551
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:06,766
 - I don't know.
- 3 seconds!

552
00:45:06,791 --> 00:45:08,303
Yes, you do.

553
00:45:09,486 --> 00:45:11,763
 Breach!
Breach! Breach!

554
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:33,116
Barnes, stop!

555
00:45:33,141 --> 00:45:35,077
You're gonna kill someone.

556
00:45:37,118 --> 00:45:39,222
I'm not gonna kill anyone.

557
00:46:24,314 --> 00:46:27,489
The suspect has escaped.
Get him!

558
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,146
Come on.

559
00:47:44,326 --> 00:47:47,017
- Sam, south. West rooftop.
- Who the hell is the other guy?

560
00:47:47,042 --> 00:47:48,903
I'm about to find out.

561
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,263
- Sam.
- Got it.

562
00:48:44,625 --> 00:48:46,429
Stand down!

563
00:48:48,808 --> 00:48:50,463
Stand down!

564
00:49:18,568 --> 00:49:21,955
- Sam, I can't shake this guy.
- Right behind you.

565
00:50:56,392 --> 00:50:59,215
Stand down.
Now.

566
00:51:05,628 --> 00:51:09,702
Congratulations, Captain.
You're a criminal.

567
00:51:31,997 --> 00:51:33,901
Your highness.

568
00:51:39,450 --> 00:51:41,598
A pinch of paprika.

569
00:51:41,821 --> 00:51:43,501
A pinch.

570
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:48,384
Is that Paprikash?

571
00:51:48,409 --> 00:51:52,786
I thought it might...
lift your spirits.

572
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:07,646
Spirits lifted.

573
00:52:08,778 --> 00:52:12,544
In my defense,
I haven't actually...

574
00:52:12,731 --> 00:52:15,159
- eaten anything before, so...
- Aye, aye.

575
00:52:15,184 --> 00:52:16,602
Please.

576
00:52:23,036 --> 00:52:24,964
- Wanda.
- Hmm.

577
00:52:24,989 --> 00:52:27,378
No one dislikes you, Wanda.

578
00:52:29,081 --> 00:52:30,883
- Thanks.
- Oh, you're welcome.

579
00:52:30,908 --> 00:52:34,627
No. It's a...
involuntary response in their amygdala

580
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:36,823
they can't help
but be afraid of you.

581
00:52:36,848 --> 00:52:38,079
Are you?

582
00:52:38,104 --> 00:52:40,806
My amygdala is synthetic, so...

583
00:52:43,398 --> 00:52:46,448
I used to think of
myself one way.

584
00:52:46,473 --> 00:52:50,753
But, after this.

585
00:52:50,778 --> 00:52:53,074
I am something else.

586
00:52:53,099 --> 00:52:56,019
And still me, I think.

587
00:52:56,044 --> 00:53:02,048
But...
 that's not what everyone else sees.

588
00:53:04,445 --> 00:53:06,776
Do you know,
I don't know what this is.

589
00:53:07,796 --> 00:53:09,192
Not really.

590
00:53:09,217 --> 00:53:10,875
I know it's not of this world.

591
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:15,191
But it powered Loki staff,
gave you your abilities. But...

592
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:21,958
 its true nature is a mystery.
And yet, it is part of me.

593
00:53:21,982 --> 00:53:23,705
Are you afraid of it?

594
00:53:23,730 --> 00:53:26,066
I wish to understand it.

595
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:28,527
The more I do,
the less it controls me.

596
00:53:28,552 --> 00:53:33,788
One day,
who knows, I may even control it.

597
00:53:35,826 --> 00:53:40,434
 I don't know what's in this
but it is not paprika.

598
00:53:40,461 --> 00:53:45,377
I'm gonna go to the store,
I'll be back in 20 minutes.

599
00:53:45,402 --> 00:53:48,989
Alternatively, we could order a pizza?

600
00:53:49,675 --> 00:53:53,206
Vision, are you not letting me leave?

601
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:58,619
- It's a question of safety.
- I can protect myself.

602
00:53:59,483 --> 00:54:01,249
Not yours.

603
00:54:02,576 --> 00:54:07,335
Mr. Stark would like to avoid
the possibility of another public incident.

604
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:11,863
Until the Accords are a...
 more secured foundation.

605
00:54:13,969 --> 00:54:16,365
And what do you want?

606
00:54:17,195 --> 00:54:21,245
For people to see you...
as I do.

607
00:54:25,169 --> 00:54:28,359
BERLIN

608
00:54:54,152 --> 00:54:56,255
- So, you like cats?
- Sam.

609
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:00,369
What? Dude shows up dressed like a cat
and you don't wanna know more?

610
00:55:01,935 --> 00:55:04,570
Your suit.
A Vibranium?

611
00:55:07,236 --> 00:55:12,214
The Black Panther has been
the protector of Wakanda for generations.

612
00:55:12,483 --> 00:55:16,382
A mantle passed
from warrior to warrior.

613
00:55:17,459 --> 00:55:20,935
And now because your friend
murdered my father,

614
00:55:21,354 --> 00:55:23,844
 I also wear the mantle of king.

615
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:29,686
So I ask you,
as both warrior and king,

616
00:55:30,078 --> 00:55:34,550
how long do you think you can keep
your friend safe from me?

617
00:55:53,902 --> 00:55:55,131
What's going to happen?

618
00:55:55,156 --> 00:55:57,148
The same thing that
ought to happen to you.

619
00:55:57,173 --> 00:55:59,703
Psychological evaluation and extradition.

620
00:55:59,728 --> 00:56:02,473
This is Everett Ross,
deputy task force commander.

621
00:56:02,497 --> 00:56:05,365
- What about our lawyer.
- Lawyer, that's funny.

622
00:56:05,391 --> 00:56:07,620
See to their weapons are
placed in the lock up.

623
00:56:07,645 --> 00:56:09,559
Oh, we'll write you a receipt.

624
00:56:09,584 --> 00:56:13,696
I better not look out the window
and see anybody flying around in that.

625
00:56:18,933 --> 00:56:22,088
You will be provided with an office
instead of a cell.

626
00:56:22,113 --> 00:56:24,382
And do me a favour,
stay in it.

627
00:56:24,755 --> 00:56:27,105
I'm not intending
on going anywhere.

628
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:31,037
For the record. This is what
making things worse looks like.

629
00:56:31,062 --> 00:56:32,617
He's alive.

630
00:56:34,082 --> 00:56:36,156
The remaining of us
are now at court-sec.

631
00:56:36,439 --> 00:56:38,132
And, Colonel Ross is supervising
the clean up.

632
00:56:38,156 --> 00:56:39,657
Try not to break anything
while we fix this.

633
00:56:39,682 --> 00:56:42,312
Consequences?
You bet there will be consequences.

634
00:56:42,927 --> 00:56:45,115
Obviously you can quote me on that
because I just said it.

635
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:48,121
Anything else?
Thank you, sir.

636
00:56:48,502 --> 00:56:49,765
Consequences?

637
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:52,653
Secretary Ross wants you both prosecuted.
I have to give him something.

638
00:56:52,677 --> 00:56:54,662
I'm not getting that shield back, am I?

639
00:56:54,688 --> 00:56:56,577
Technically, it's the government's property.

640
00:56:56,602 --> 00:56:58,496
- Wings too.
- That's cold.

641
00:56:58,521 --> 00:57:00,320
Warmer than jail.

642
00:57:27,729 --> 00:57:30,070
Hey, you want to see something cool?

643
00:57:30,629 --> 00:57:32,932
I pulled something from dad's archives.

644
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:35,983
Well, timely.

645
00:57:39,917 --> 00:57:43,582
FDR signed the Land-Lease bills
with these in 1941.

646
00:57:43,868 --> 00:57:46,870
Provided support to the allies
when they needed most.

647
00:57:46,895 --> 00:57:49,792
Someone said it brought
our country closer to war.

648
00:57:50,819 --> 00:57:53,267
Seen enough of these,
you wouldn't be here.

649
00:57:54,773 --> 00:57:57,377
 I'm trying to,
what do you call it?

650
00:57:57,402 --> 00:58:02,022
 a... an al'fermage.
Is that what you call it?

651
00:58:03,197 --> 00:58:05,907
Is Pepper here?
I didn't see her.

652
00:58:06,954 --> 00:58:09,978
We are... kinda...

653
00:58:10,003 --> 00:58:11,750
- well not kinda...
- Pregnant?

654
00:58:11,775 --> 00:58:15,254
No, definitely not.
We're taking a break.

655
00:58:15,765 --> 00:58:17,575
It's nobody's fault.

656
00:58:18,577 --> 00:58:20,742
So sorry, Tony.
I didn't know.

657
00:58:20,767 --> 00:58:24,513
Few years ago, I almost lost her,
so I trashed all my suits.

658
00:58:24,538 --> 00:58:26,404
Then, we had to muck up Hydra.

659
00:58:26,429 --> 00:58:29,131
And then Ultron, my fault.

660
00:58:29,156 --> 00:58:32,559
And then, and then, and then.
I never stopped.

661
00:58:32,584 --> 00:58:35,179
Cause the truth is
I don't wanna stop.

662
00:58:36,363 --> 00:58:38,101
I don't want to lose her.

663
00:58:38,570 --> 00:58:41,570
I thought maybe the Accords
can split the difference.

664
00:58:44,898 --> 00:58:47,128
In her defense, I'm her handful.

665
00:58:48,184 --> 00:58:52,465
Yet, dad was a pain in the ass,
but he and mom always made it work.

666
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:54,798
You know, I'm glad Howard got married.

667
00:58:54,823 --> 00:58:56,691
I only knew him when
he was young and single.

668
00:58:56,716 --> 00:58:59,045
Oh really?
You two know each other?

669
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:03,303
He never mentioned that.
Maybe only a thousand times.

670
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:05,803
God, I hated you.

671
00:59:07,295 --> 00:59:08,682
I don't mean to make things difficult.

672
00:59:08,707 --> 00:59:11,217
I know.
Because you're a very polite person.

673
00:59:11,805 --> 00:59:16,714
If I see a situation pointed south,
I can't ignore it.

674
00:59:16,739 --> 00:59:19,402
- Sometimes I wish I could.
- No, you don't.

675
00:59:22,241 --> 00:59:25,456
No, I don't.
Sometimes...

676
00:59:25,481 --> 00:59:28,909
Sometimes I wanna punch you
in your perfect teeth.

677
00:59:29,326 --> 00:59:31,508
But I don't wanna see you gone.

678
00:59:31,533 --> 00:59:33,141
We need you, Cap.

679
00:59:33,643 --> 00:59:37,317
Until further nothing's happen
that can't be undone, please... sign.

680
00:59:37,492 --> 00:59:39,561
We can make the last 24 hours legit.

681
00:59:39,587 --> 00:59:44,176
Barnes gets transferred to an American
psych center instead of a Wakanda prison.

682
00:59:55,886 --> 00:59:59,247
I'm not saying it's impossible.
But there would have to be safeguards

683
00:59:59,272 --> 01:00:00,572
Sure.

684
01:00:00,796 --> 01:00:03,672
She's confined in a compound currently.
Vision's keeping her company.

685
01:00:03,697 --> 01:00:05,772
Oh God, Tony!
Every time.

686
01:00:05,804 --> 01:00:08,042
Every time I think you're seeing
things the right way...

687
01:00:08,068 --> 01:00:09,353
What? It's a 100 acres with a lap pool.

688
01:00:09,378 --> 01:00:11,648
It's got a screening room.
There's worse ways to protect people.

689
01:00:11,673 --> 01:00:13,872
Protection?
Is that how you see this?

690
01:00:13,896 --> 01:00:16,127
This is protection?
It's internment, Tony.

691
01:00:16,153 --> 01:00:17,278
She's not a US Citizen

692
01:00:17,303 --> 01:00:19,347
- Oh, come on, Tony.
- and they don't grant visas to
Weapons of Mass Destruction.

693
01:00:19,372 --> 01:00:21,692
- She's a kid!
- GIVE ME A BREAK!

694
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:24,765
I'm doing what has to be done

695
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:27,566
... to save us from something worse.

696
01:00:29,949 --> 01:00:32,271
You keep telling yourself that.

697
01:00:35,041 --> 01:00:37,365
Hate to break up the set.

698
01:00:43,758 --> 01:00:45,488
Hello, Mr. Barnes.

699
01:00:45,513 --> 01:00:48,564
I've been sent by the
United Nations to evaluate you.

700
01:00:48,589 --> 01:00:50,336
Do you mind if I sit?

701
01:00:55,832 --> 01:00:58,244
Your first name is James?

702
01:00:58,752 --> 01:01:01,132
The receipt for your gear.

703
01:01:02,888 --> 01:01:04,581
Bird costume?
Come on.

704
01:01:04,606 --> 01:01:06,264
I didn't write it.

705
01:01:12,505 --> 01:01:14,375
I'm not here to judge you.

706
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,143
I just want to ask you
a few questions.

707
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:20,081
Do you know where you are, James?

708
01:01:23,205 --> 01:01:26,486
I can't help you
if you don't talk to me, James.

709
01:01:26,768 --> 01:01:28,895
My name is Bucky.

710
01:01:37,418 --> 01:01:38,942
Hello?

711
01:01:45,914 --> 01:01:47,467
Hey.

712
01:01:53,379 --> 01:01:54,959
Okay.

713
01:01:56,049 --> 01:01:59,040
Here.
Just sign here.

714
01:01:59,064 --> 01:02:00,976
- Here?
- Yeah.

715
01:02:07,530 --> 01:02:10,511
Why would the task force
release this photo to begin with?

716
01:02:10,536 --> 01:02:12,850
Get the word out,
involve as many eyes as we can?

717
01:02:12,875 --> 01:02:14,125
Right.

718
01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:15,944
It's a good way to flush
a guy out of hiding.

719
01:02:15,969 --> 01:02:17,940
Set off a bomb,
get your picture taken.

720
01:02:17,965 --> 01:02:20,166
It got 7 million people looking
for the Winter soldier.

721
01:02:20,191 --> 01:02:22,017
You're saying someone
framed him to find him.

722
01:02:22,042 --> 01:02:24,589
Steve, we looked for the guy
for 2 years and found nothing.

723
01:02:24,614 --> 01:02:26,818
We didn't bomb the UN.
That turns a lot of heads.

724
01:02:26,843 --> 01:02:28,956
So? That doesn't guarantee that
whoever framed him

725
01:02:28,996 --> 01:02:31,291
would get him a guarantees
that we would.

726
01:02:37,608 --> 01:02:39,119
Yeah.

727
01:02:41,136 --> 01:02:42,850
Tell me Bucky.

728
01:02:42,999 --> 01:02:45,446
You've seen a great deal, haven't you?

729
01:02:46,747 --> 01:02:49,185
I don't want to talk about it.

730
01:02:49,210 --> 01:02:50,428
You feel that...

731
01:02:50,453 --> 01:02:54,244
if you open your mouth,
the horrors might never stop.

732
01:02:57,849 --> 01:02:59,270
Don't worry.

733
01:02:59,295 --> 01:03:01,520
<font color="#80ffff">[MESSAGE INBOX: 1]
STATUS: PACKAGE DELIVERED</font>

734
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:04,660
We only have to talk about one.

735
01:03:15,028 --> 01:03:16,974
Hey.
What is this?

736
01:03:27,579 --> 01:03:29,923
Great. Come on, guys.
Get me eyes on Barnes.

737
01:03:29,948 --> 01:03:30,956
Go.

738
01:03:30,981 --> 01:03:34,233
Friday.
Give me the source of that damage.

739
01:03:35,296 --> 01:03:37,368
Sub-level 5, east wing.

740
01:03:40,608 --> 01:03:43,865
- What the hell is this?
- Why don't we discuss your home?

741
01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:47,572
Not Romania.
Certainly not Brooklyn, no.

742
01:03:48,154 --> 01:03:52,269
I mean, your real home.

743
01:03:57,386 --> 01:03:59,220
Longing.

744
01:04:01,856 --> 01:04:03,217
Rusted.

745
01:04:03,242 --> 01:04:04,468
Stop.

746
01:04:04,493 --> 01:04:06,350
Seventeen.

747
01:04:07,781 --> 01:04:09,226
Stop.

748
01:04:11,224 --> 01:04:12,875
Daybreak.

749
01:04:18,342 --> 01:04:19,774
Furnace.

750
01:04:21,993 --> 01:04:23,550
Nine.

751
01:04:25,952 --> 01:04:28,151
Benign.

752
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:32,812
Homecoming

753
01:04:32,837 --> 01:04:34,477
One.

754
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:37,386
Freight car.

755
01:04:52,751 --> 01:04:54,291
Soldier?

756
01:04:56,865 --> 01:04:59,247
You're not the one in charge.

757
01:04:59,272 --> 01:05:05,373
Mission report.
December 16, 1991

758
01:05:15,098 --> 01:05:18,546
Help me.
Help?

759
01:05:21,529 --> 01:05:22,845
Get up.

760
01:05:25,684 --> 01:05:27,947
Who are you?
What do you want?

761
01:05:29,042 --> 01:05:31,611
To see the empire fall.

762
01:06:02,586 --> 01:06:04,054
Hey.

763
01:06:10,837 --> 01:06:12,137
Evac all civilians.

764
01:06:12,162 --> 01:06:14,687
Give me a perimeter around the building
and gunships in the air.

765
01:06:14,712 --> 01:06:16,223
Please tell me you have a suit.

766
01:06:16,247 --> 01:06:18,734
Sure did. It's a lovely Tom Ford,
three-Piece, 2 button...

767
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:21,073
I'm on active duty, non combatant

768
01:06:21,098 --> 01:06:22,595
Follow me.

769
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:41,082
We're in position.

770
01:07:12,867 --> 01:07:15,380
You really don't recognize me?

771
01:08:07,623 --> 01:08:09,154
Damn it.

772
01:09:46,268 --> 01:09:48,215
He asked me again
if you're going to be there?

773
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:50,468
I said I wasn't sure.

774
01:09:50,493 --> 01:09:53,991
You should've seen his little face.
Just try, okay?

775
01:09:54,070 --> 01:09:57,868
I'm going to bed.
I love you.

776
01:10:00,596 --> 01:10:04,964
James Barnes, the suspect in the
bombing of the UN in Vienna

777
01:10:04,989 --> 01:10:06,892
escaped from prison today

778
01:10:06,917 --> 01:10:11,979
Also disappeared are the Avengers,
Captain Steve Rogers and Sam Wilson.

779
01:10:14,158 --> 01:10:17,324
GATE 6 - BERLIN AIRPORT>
MOSCOW

780
01:10:35,179 --> 01:10:36,858
Hey, Cap!

781
01:10:48,987 --> 01:10:50,636
Steve.

782
01:10:51,136 --> 01:10:53,387
Which Bucky am I talking to?

783
01:10:54,849 --> 01:10:57,614
Your mother's name is Sarah.

784
01:11:01,163 --> 01:11:04,837
You used to wear newspapers
in your shoes.

785
01:11:05,929 --> 01:11:07,205
You can't read that in a museum.

786
01:11:07,230 --> 01:11:09,432
Just like that,
we're suppose to be cool?

787
01:11:09,457 --> 01:11:11,985
- What did I do?
- Enough.

788
01:11:12,010 --> 01:11:13,530
I knew this would happen.

789
01:11:13,555 --> 01:11:16,185
Everything HYDRA put inside me
is still there.

790
01:11:16,210 --> 01:11:18,207
All he had to do is say
the god damn words.

791
01:11:18,232 --> 01:11:19,923
- Who was he?
- I don't know.

792
01:11:19,948 --> 01:11:22,397
People are dead.
The bombing. The set up.

793
01:11:22,422 --> 01:11:24,625
The doctor did all that
just to get 10 minutes with you.

794
01:11:24,650 --> 01:11:27,574
I need you to do better than
"I don't know."

795
01:11:30,292 --> 01:11:33,221
He wanted to know about Siberia.

796
01:11:35,610 --> 01:11:37,603
Where I was kept.

797
01:11:39,284 --> 01:11:42,983
- He wanted to know exactly where.
- Why would he need to know that?

798
01:11:45,381 --> 01:11:48,506
Because I'm not the only Winter soldier.

799
01:11:48,531 --> 01:11:51,299
1991

800
01:13:20,038 --> 01:13:22,337
Good job.

801
01:13:32,088 --> 01:13:34,331
Get me out of here.

802
01:13:48,357 --> 01:13:51,490
- Who were they?
- The most elite death squad.

803
01:13:51,515 --> 01:13:53,861
More kills than anyone
in the HYDRA history.

804
01:13:53,886 --> 01:13:56,598
- And that was before the serum.
- They all turned out like you?

805
01:13:56,623 --> 01:13:57,998
Worse.

806
01:13:58,111 --> 01:14:00,897
The doctor, can he control them?

807
01:14:00,922 --> 01:14:02,477
Enough.

808
01:14:02,501 --> 01:14:05,404
- He said he wanted to see an empire fall.
- With these guys he can do it.

809
01:14:05,429 --> 01:14:08,728
They speak 30 languages,
can hide in plain sight,

810
01:14:08,753 --> 01:14:11,098
infiltrate, assassinate, destabilize,

811
01:14:11,123 --> 01:14:13,220
They can take a whole country
down in 1 night.

812
01:14:13,245 --> 01:14:15,430
You'd never see them coming.

813
01:14:16,965 --> 01:14:19,471
This would be a lot easier
if we could...

814
01:14:19,496 --> 01:14:20,678
If we call Tony.

815
01:14:20,703 --> 01:14:22,424
- Oh, he won't believe us.
- Even if he did.

816
01:14:22,449 --> 01:14:25,613
Who knows if the Accords
will let him help.

817
01:14:26,182 --> 01:14:28,006
We're on our own.

818
01:14:28,447 --> 01:14:30,170
Maybe not.

819
01:14:31,185 --> 01:14:33,121
I know a guy.

820
01:14:33,457 --> 01:14:37,141
And I don't suppose you have
any idea where they are.

821
01:14:37,166 --> 01:14:39,493
We will.
GSG-9's got the borders covered.

822
01:14:39,518 --> 01:14:41,902
Recons flying 24/7.

823
01:14:41,927 --> 01:14:43,367
They'll get a hit.
We'll handle it

824
01:14:43,392 --> 01:14:45,263
You don't get it, Stark.
It's not yours to handle.

825
01:14:45,288 --> 01:14:49,176
It's clearly you can't be objective.
I'm putting special ops on this.

826
01:14:49,201 --> 01:14:51,958
And what happens when the shooting starts,
let them kill Steve Rogers?

827
01:14:51,990 --> 01:14:53,510
If we are provoked.

828
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:57,089
Barnes would have been eliminate
in Romania if it wasn't for Rogers.

829
01:14:57,114 --> 01:15:01,341
There are dead people
who would be alive now.

830
01:15:01,795 --> 01:15:03,373
Feel free to check my math.

831
01:15:03,413 --> 01:15:06,633
All due respect, you're not going to
solve this with boys in bullet vest.

832
01:15:06,658 --> 01:15:07,947
You got to let
us bring him in.

833
01:15:07,972 --> 01:15:09,913
And how will that end
any differently from the last time.

834
01:15:09,938 --> 01:15:13,943
Because this time I won't be
wearing Loafers and a silk suit.

835
01:15:13,968 --> 01:15:16,296
72 hours, guaranteed.

836
01:15:16,321 --> 01:15:18,445
36 hours.

837
01:15:19,710 --> 01:15:21,426
Barnes.

838
01:15:22,549 --> 01:15:25,507
Rogers.
Wilson.

839
01:15:25,532 --> 01:15:27,257
Thank you, sir.

840
01:15:31,203 --> 01:15:33,814
My left arm is numb, 
is that normal?

841
01:15:36,432 --> 01:15:38,067
You alright?

842
01:15:38,092 --> 01:15:39,610
Always.

843
01:15:42,664 --> 01:15:45,218
36 hours, jeez.

844
01:15:45,243 --> 01:15:48,457
- We're seriously understaffed.
- Oh, yeah.

845
01:15:48,482 --> 01:15:52,179
It would be great if we have a hulk,
right about now. Any shot?

846
01:15:52,204 --> 01:15:53,545
No.

847
01:15:53,747 --> 01:15:56,414
You really think
he'd be on our side?

848
01:15:56,439 --> 01:15:57,587
I know.

849
01:15:57,612 --> 01:16:00,544
- I've an idea.
- Me too.

850
01:16:00,569 --> 01:16:03,550
- What's yours?
- Downstairs.

851
01:16:03,575 --> 01:16:05,399
What's yours?

852
01:16:06,941 --> 01:16:11,999
QUEENS

853
01:16:26,782 --> 01:16:29,563
- Hey, Aunt May.
- Hey.

854
01:16:31,706 --> 01:16:34,706
- How was school today?
- Okay.

855
01:16:34,732 --> 01:16:37,649
This crazy car parked outside...

856
01:16:40,561 --> 01:16:43,059
- Oh, Mr. Parker.
- Umm.

857
01:16:44,445 --> 01:16:46,679
What.
What are you doing...?

858
01:16:46,704 --> 01:16:48,957
Hey.
I'm-I'm-I'm Peter.

859
01:16:48,982 --> 01:16:50,564
- Tony.
- What are...

860
01:16:50,589 --> 01:16:52,056
What are you-What are you-
What are you doing here?

861
01:16:52,081 --> 01:16:55,274
It's about time we met.
You've been getting my e-mails, right?

862
01:16:55,299 --> 01:16:57,353
- Right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

863
01:16:57,381 --> 01:16:59,727
- Regarding the...
- You didn't tell me about the grant.

864
01:16:59,751 --> 01:17:01,251
- About the grant.
- The September Foundation.

865
01:17:01,277 --> 01:17:03,743
- Right.
- Yeah. Remember when you applied.

866
01:17:03,914 --> 01:17:05,406
- Yeah.
- I approved.

867
01:17:05,431 --> 01:17:07,912
So now, we're in business.

868
01:17:07,937 --> 01:17:09,839
You didn't tell me anything.
What's up with that?

869
01:17:09,864 --> 01:17:11,258
- You're keeping secrets from me?
- Why, I just, I just...

870
01:17:11,283 --> 01:17:12,792
I just know how much
you love surprises,

871
01:17:12,816 --> 01:17:15,912
so I thought I would let you know...
wh...

872
01:17:15,937 --> 01:17:17,862
- Anyway, what did I apply for?
- That's what I'm here to hash out.

873
01:17:17,896 --> 01:17:19,692
Okay.
Hash, hash out, okay.

874
01:17:19,717 --> 01:17:23,184
It's so hard for me to believe
that she's someone's aunt.

875
01:17:23,209 --> 01:17:25,379
We come in all shapes and sizes,
you know.

876
01:17:25,404 --> 01:17:27,471
This walnut bake loaf is exceptional.

877
01:17:27,496 --> 01:17:29,065
- Let me just stop you there.
- Yeah?

878
01:17:29,090 --> 01:17:33,080
Is this grant, like, got money
involved or whatever? No?

879
01:17:33,105 --> 01:17:34,242
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

880
01:17:34,267 --> 01:17:35,829
- It's pretty well funded.
- Wow.

881
01:17:35,854 --> 01:17:37,660
Look who you're talking to.

882
01:17:37,685 --> 01:17:40,331
- Can I have 5 minutes with him?
- Sure.

883
01:17:45,643 --> 01:17:49,211
As walnut bake loaves go,
that wasn't bad.

884
01:17:50,126 --> 01:17:52,971
Oh. What do we have here,
retro tech, huh?

885
01:17:52,996 --> 01:17:56,044
- Salvation army?
- Uh, the garbage actually.

886
01:17:56,069 --> 01:17:58,153
- You're a dumpster diver.
- Yeah, I was...

887
01:17:58,178 --> 01:17:59,714
Anyway, look.
Umm.

888
01:17:59,739 --> 01:18:01,473
I definitely did not
apply for your grant.

889
01:18:01,498 --> 01:18:03,202
- Uh,uh. Me first.
- Okay.

890
01:18:03,227 --> 01:18:05,931
Quick question of the rhetorical variety.

891
01:18:07,173 --> 01:18:09,363
That's you, right?

892
01:18:09,598 --> 01:18:10,416
Um, no.

893
01:18:10,441 --> 01:18:12,253
- What do you. What do you...
- Yeah.

894
01:18:13,077 --> 01:18:14,683
Look at you go.

895
01:18:14,708 --> 01:18:18,053
Wow, nice catch!
3000 pounds. 40 miles an hour.

896
01:18:18,078 --> 01:18:20,875
It’s not easy. 
You got mad skills.

897
01:18:20,900 --> 01:18:22,734
That's all-That's all
on Youtube though right.

898
01:18:22,759 --> 01:18:24,532
I mean that's where you found it.

899
01:18:24,557 --> 01:18:26,983
Cause' you know that's all fake.
It's all done on a computer?

900
01:18:27,016 --> 01:18:28,322
Mm-Hmm.

901
01:18:28,347 --> 01:18:29,603
It's like that video that records...

902
01:18:29,628 --> 01:18:32,404
Yea yea yea yea...oh you mean
like those UFOs over Phoenix?

903
01:18:32,437 --> 01:18:33,591
Exactly!

904
01:18:33,616 --> 01:18:35,247
What have we here?

905
01:18:36,428 --> 01:18:38,814
Uh...
That's a...

906
01:18:41,402 --> 01:18:42,696
So.

907
01:18:44,176 --> 01:18:46,229
You're this... Spider... ling.

908
01:18:46,254 --> 01:18:48,933
Crime fighting Spider...
You're Spider-Boy?

909
01:18:50,878 --> 01:18:52,829
S... Spider-Man.

910
01:18:52,854 --> 01:18:54,862
Not in that wanzie, you're not.

911
01:18:55,351 --> 01:18:57,286
It's not a wanzie.

912
01:18:58,566 --> 01:19:01,833
You won't believe this. I was actually having
a real good day today, you know, Mr. Stark.

913
01:19:01,858 --> 01:19:05,634
Didn’t miss my trains. This perfectly good
DVD player was just sitting there and...

914
01:19:05,659 --> 01:19:08,837
Algebra test.
Nailed it!

915
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:11,423
Who else knows?
Anybody?

916
01:19:12,247 --> 01:19:13,690
Nobody.

917
01:19:13,715 --> 01:19:16,846
- Not even your...unusually attractive Aunt?
- No.

918
01:19:16,871 --> 01:19:19,812
No, no. No, no.
If she knew, she would freak out.

919
01:19:19,837 --> 01:19:21,683
And when she freaks out,
I freak out.

920
01:19:21,708 --> 01:19:24,827
You know what I think
is really cool? This webbing.

921
01:19:25,125 --> 01:19:27,909
Tensile strength is off the charts

922
01:19:27,934 --> 01:19:31,153
- Who manufactured them?
- I did.

923
01:19:31,614 --> 01:19:32,902
Climbing the walls.

924
01:19:32,927 --> 01:19:34,999
How are you doing that?
Cohesive gloves.

925
01:19:35,023 --> 01:19:36,746
It's a long story.
I was uh...

926
01:19:36,771 --> 01:19:39,000
Lordy!
Can you even see in these?

927
01:19:39,025 --> 01:19:41,885
Yes. Yes, I can!
I can.

928
01:19:42,455 --> 01:19:45,897
I can-I can see in those. Okay?
It's just that...

929
01:19:45,922 --> 01:19:50,243
when...whatever happened happened,
it's like my senses have been dialed to 11.

930
01:19:50,550 --> 01:19:54,762
There's way too much input, so...
they just kinda help me focus.

931
01:19:54,787 --> 01:19:57,432
You're in dire need of an upgrade.

932
01:19:57,457 --> 01:19:59,100
Systemic, top to bottom.

933
01:19:59,124 --> 01:20:01,622
100-point restoration.
That's why I'm here

934
01:20:03,828 --> 01:20:05,687
Why are you doing this?

935
01:20:06,325 --> 01:20:07,639
I got to know.
What's your MO.

936
01:20:07,664 --> 01:20:10,242
What gets you out of that
twin bed in the morning?

937
01:20:10,267 --> 01:20:11,777
Because...

938
01:20:15,566 --> 01:20:17,631
... because I’ve been me
my whole life,

939
01:20:17,659 --> 01:20:20,735
- and I’ve had these powers for 6 months.
- Mm-Hm.

940
01:20:20,776 --> 01:20:23,662
I read books,
I build computers...

941
01:20:24,359 --> 01:20:27,099
And-And yeah.
I would love to play football.

942
01:20:27,124 --> 01:20:28,813
But I couldn't then
so I shouldn't now.

943
01:20:28,841 --> 01:20:30,646
- Sure. 'Cause you're different.
- Exactly.

944
01:20:30,671 --> 01:20:33,457
But I can't tell anybody that,
so I'm not.

945
01:20:37,344 --> 01:20:39,790
When you can do the things
that I can,

946
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:42,407
but you don't...

947
01:20:43,462 --> 01:20:45,907
and then the bad things happen,

948
01:20:47,072 --> 01:20:49,107
 they happen because of you.

949
01:20:53,378 --> 01:20:56,293
 So you wanna look out for the little guy.
You wanna do your part.

950
01:20:56,318 --> 01:20:58,027
Make the world a better place
all that, right?

951
01:20:58,059 --> 01:21:01,565
Yeah. Yeah just looking out...
for the little guy.

952
01:21:01,669 --> 01:21:03,908
That's-That's what it is.

953
01:21:10,852 --> 01:21:13,500
I'm going to sit here,
so you move the leg.

954
01:21:21,961 --> 01:21:23,536
- You got passport?
- Uh, no.

955
01:21:23,561 --> 01:21:26,115
- I don't even have a driving license.
- You ever been to Germany?

956
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:27,324
- No.
- Oh, you'll love it.

957
01:21:27,356 --> 01:21:30,073
- I can't go to Germany!
- Why?

958
01:21:31,781 --> 01:21:33,852
I got... homework.

959
01:21:33,877 --> 01:21:35,266
Alright, I gonna pretend
you didn't say that.

960
01:21:35,291 --> 01:21:38,073
I'm-I'm being serious!
I can't just drop out of school!

961
01:21:38,098 --> 01:21:39,203
Fighting crime is dangerous.

962
01:21:39,228 --> 01:21:42,063
Better tell Aunt Hottie to
take you on a field trip...

963
01:21:43,808 --> 01:21:45,662
Don’t tell Aunt May.

964
01:21:46,417 --> 01:21:48,390
Alright, Spider-Man.

965
01:21:51,260 --> 01:21:54,471
- Get me out of this.
- I'm sorry, I'll get that.

966
01:22:06,637 --> 01:22:09,862
- What is it?
- Stay here, please.

967
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:19,598
- Guess I should have knocked.
- Oh my god.

968
01:22:19,901 --> 01:22:23,554
- What are you doing here?
- Disappointing my kids.

969
01:22:27,188 --> 01:22:29,472
I'm suppose to go water skiing.

970
01:22:29,497 --> 01:22:31,610
Cap needs our help, come on.

971
01:22:31,635 --> 01:22:33,131
Clint!

972
01:22:34,141 --> 01:22:36,244
You should not be here.

973
01:22:38,084 --> 01:22:39,512
Really?

974
01:22:39,698 --> 01:22:42,809
I retired for, what, like 5 minutes?
And it all goes to shit.

975
01:22:42,849 --> 01:22:45,379
Please consider the consequences
of your actions.

976
01:22:45,404 --> 01:22:47,350
Okay, they're considered.

977
01:22:47,868 --> 01:22:49,868
Okay, we got to go.

978
01:22:53,985 --> 01:22:55,540
It's this way.

979
01:22:55,565 --> 01:22:58,041
I've caused enough problems.

980
01:23:01,901 --> 01:23:03,423
You got to help me, Wanda.

981
01:23:03,449 --> 01:23:05,218
... you can go to high school.

982
01:23:05,243 --> 01:23:08,892
You want to make amends.
You get off your ass.

983
01:23:08,917 --> 01:23:10,360
Shit.

984
01:23:16,126 --> 01:23:18,336
I know I should have stretch.

985
01:23:31,507 --> 01:23:36,085
- Clint, you can't overpower me.
- I know I can't

986
01:23:36,529 --> 01:23:38,380
But, she can.

987
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:43,224
Vision.
That's enough, let him go.

988
01:23:43,615 --> 01:23:46,710
- I'm leaving.
- I can't let you.

989
01:23:50,898 --> 01:23:52,660
I'm sorry.

990
01:23:55,794 --> 01:23:57,890
If you do this,

991
01:23:57,922 --> 01:24:01,643
they will never stop
being afraid of you.

992
01:24:02,292 --> 01:24:06,375
I can't control their fear,
only my own.

993
01:24:17,965 --> 01:24:19,680
Oh...

994
01:24:21,229 --> 01:24:24,279
Come on.
We got one more stop.

995
01:24:24,445 --> 01:24:26,176
It's just a matter of time.

996
01:24:26,201 --> 01:24:31,622
Our satellites are running facial, biometric
and behavioral pattern scans.

997
01:24:35,079 --> 01:24:38,067
Move, or you will be moved.

998
01:24:38,789 --> 01:24:41,666
As entertaining as that would be.

999
01:24:41,691 --> 01:24:44,005
You really think you can find him?

1000
01:24:44,328 --> 01:24:46,137
Our resources are considerable.

1001
01:24:46,162 --> 01:24:48,649
Yeah. It took the world
70 years to find Barnes.

1002
01:24:48,674 --> 01:24:51,696
So, you could probably do better
than them by half that time.

1003
01:24:52,341 --> 01:24:54,110
You know where they are.

1004
01:24:54,135 --> 01:24:56,251
I know someone who does.

1005
01:24:58,769 --> 01:25:01,470
I'm not sure you understand
the concept of a get away car.

1006
01:25:01,495 --> 01:25:03,189
It's low profile.

1007
01:25:03,215 --> 01:25:06,539
Good, 'cause this stuff
tends to draw a crowd.

1008
01:25:07,832 --> 01:25:10,892
- Can you move your seat up?
- No.

1009
01:25:10,918 --> 01:25:12,402
I owe you again.

1010
01:25:12,427 --> 01:25:14,334
I'm keeping a list.

1011
01:25:17,225 --> 01:25:19,602
You know, he kind of try to kill me.

1012
01:25:19,927 --> 01:25:22,955
Sorry, I'll put it on the list.

1013
01:25:25,892 --> 01:25:27,914
They're going to come looking for you.

1014
01:25:28,523 --> 01:25:30,117
I know.

1015
01:25:31,981 --> 01:25:33,838
Thank you, Sharon.

1016
01:25:48,907 --> 01:25:51,239
- That was...
- Late.

1017
01:25:51,263 --> 01:25:52,914
Damn right.

1018
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:58,825
- I should go.
- Okay.

1019
01:26:23,391 --> 01:26:24,723
Cap.

1020
01:26:24,894 --> 01:26:26,669
You know I wouldn't have called
If I had any other choice.

1021
01:26:26,694 --> 01:26:30,917
Hey man, you're doing me a favour.
Besides... I'm on your team.

1022
01:26:30,941 --> 01:26:34,790
- Thanks for having my back.
- It was time to get off my ass.

1023
01:26:34,815 --> 01:26:36,623
About our other recruit.

1024
01:26:36,648 --> 01:26:38,551
He's ready to go.

1025
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:41,252
I have to put a little coffee in him,
but...

1026
01:26:41,603 --> 01:26:43,355
.. he should be good.

1027
01:26:45,865 --> 01:26:47,650
What timezone is this?

1028
01:26:47,675 --> 01:26:49,947
Come on.
Come on.

1029
01:26:52,550 --> 01:26:55,181
- Captain America.
- Mr. Lang.

1030
01:26:55,778 --> 01:26:58,857
It's an honor.
I'm shaking your hand too long.

1031
01:26:58,882 --> 01:27:01,432
Wow. This is awesome.
Captain America.

1032
01:27:01,457 --> 01:27:03,752
I know you too, you're great.

1033
01:27:06,664 --> 01:27:08,189
Jeez.

1034
01:27:08,277 --> 01:27:09,585
Look, I wanted to say.

1035
01:27:09,610 --> 01:27:12,457
I know you know a lot of super people,
so...

1036
01:27:12,847 --> 01:27:14,759
Thanks for thinking of me.

1037
01:27:14,784 --> 01:27:17,123
- Hey, man.
- What's up tic-tac.

1038
01:27:17,148 --> 01:27:19,519
Good to see you.
Look. What happened last time was a...

1039
01:27:19,544 --> 01:27:22,905
It was a great audition, but it'll...
it'll never happen again.

1040
01:27:22,930 --> 01:27:25,105
Did he tell you
what we're up against?

1041
01:27:25,316 --> 01:27:28,705
Something about some... psycho assassins.

1042
01:27:28,737 --> 01:27:31,026
We're outside the law on this one.

1043
01:27:31,051 --> 01:27:33,474
So, if you come with us,
you're a wanted man.

1044
01:27:33,499 --> 01:27:35,043
Yeah, well, what else is new?

1045
01:27:35,068 --> 01:27:38,225
- We should get moving.
- I got a chopper lining up.

1046
01:27:42,924 --> 01:27:44,677
They're evacuating the airport.

1047
01:27:44,702 --> 01:27:47,134
- Stark.
- Stark?

1048
01:27:48,383 --> 01:27:49,840
Suit up.

1049
01:28:10,176 --> 01:28:12,344
Wow, it's so weird how you run
into people at the airport.

1050
01:28:12,378 --> 01:28:14,200
- Don't you just feel weird?
- Definitely weird.

1051
01:28:14,225 --> 01:28:15,445
Hear me out, Tony.

1052
01:28:15,470 --> 01:28:19,453
That doctor, the psychiatrist,
he's behind all of this.

1053
01:28:22,089 --> 01:28:24,859
- Captain.
- Your highness.

1054
01:28:24,884 --> 01:28:26,172
Anyway.

1055
01:28:26,197 --> 01:28:28,432
Ross gave me 36 hours
to bring you in.

1056
01:28:28,457 --> 01:28:30,263
That was 24 hours ago.

1057
01:28:30,288 --> 01:28:32,829
- Can you help a brother out?
- You're after the wrong guy.

1058
01:28:32,854 --> 01:28:35,160
Your judgment is askew.

1059
01:28:35,722 --> 01:28:37,564
Your war buddy killed
innocent people yesterday.

1060
01:28:37,589 --> 01:28:40,533
And there are 5 more
super soldiers just like him.

1061
01:28:40,806 --> 01:28:43,160
I can't let the doctor find them first,
Tony. I can't.

1062
01:28:43,185 --> 01:28:44,664
Steve.

1063
01:28:45,031 --> 01:28:47,720
You know, what's about to happen.

1064
01:28:47,745 --> 01:28:50,846
Do you really want to punch
your way out of this one?

1065
01:28:54,177 --> 01:28:56,252
All right, I've run out of patience.

1066
01:28:56,277 --> 01:28:58,009
Underoos!

1067
01:29:02,706 --> 01:29:04,220
Nice job, kid.

1068
01:29:04,245 --> 01:29:06,365
Thanks. Well, I could've stuck
the landing a little better.

1069
01:29:06,390 --> 01:29:07,653
It's... just the new suit...

1070
01:29:07,678 --> 01:29:10,112
Well, it's nothing, Mr. Stark
It's-It's perfect, thank you.

1071
01:29:10,136 --> 01:29:11,764
Yeah, we don't really need to
start a conversation.

1072
01:29:11,789 --> 01:29:14,227
Okay.
Cap... Captain.

1073
01:29:14,658 --> 01:29:15,857
Big fan, I'm Spider-Man.

1074
01:29:15,882 --> 01:29:17,622
Yeah, we'll talk about it later.
Just...

1075
01:29:17,647 --> 01:29:19,601
- Hey, everyone.
- ... good job.

1076
01:29:19,626 --> 01:29:22,623
- You've been busy.
- And you've been a complete idiot.

1077
01:29:22,648 --> 01:29:23,813
Dragging in Clint.

1078
01:29:23,838 --> 01:29:25,980
Rescuing Wanda from a place
she doesn't even want to leave.

1079
01:29:26,005 --> 01:29:29,129
A safe place.
I'm trying to keep....

1080
01:29:30,124 --> 01:29:33,282
I'm trying to keep you from
tearing the Avengers apart.

1081
01:29:33,667 --> 01:29:35,657
You did that when you signed.

1082
01:29:36,976 --> 01:29:38,480
Alright, I'm done.

1083
01:29:38,714 --> 01:29:40,855
You're gonna turn Barnes over
and you're gonna come with us.

1084
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:43,015
NOW!
Because it's us!

1085
01:29:43,040 --> 01:29:47,151
We're squaded JSOC, guys,
with no compunction about being impolite.

1086
01:29:51,493 --> 01:29:53,003
We found it.

1087
01:29:54,334 --> 01:29:57,443
The quinjet's in hanger five,
north runway.

1088
01:30:00,753 --> 01:30:02,384
Alright, Lang.

1089
01:30:02,939 --> 01:30:04,741
Hey, guys.
Something...

1090
01:30:04,935 --> 01:30:06,450
Whoa.
What-What the hell was that?

1091
01:30:06,475 --> 01:30:08,354
I believe this is yours, Captain America.

1092
01:30:08,382 --> 01:30:10,878
Oh, great.
Alright, there's two on the parking deck.

1093
01:30:10,903 --> 01:30:12,987
One of them is Maximoff,
I'm going to grab her.

1094
01:30:13,012 --> 01:30:14,177
Rhodey, you want to take Cap?

1095
01:30:14,202 --> 01:30:16,421
Got two in the terminal.
Wilson and Barnes.

1096
01:30:16,446 --> 01:30:18,301
Barnes is mine!

1097
01:30:18,811 --> 01:30:20,177
Hey, Mr. Stark, what should I do?

1098
01:30:20,249 --> 01:30:22,207
What we discussed.
Keep your distance. Web em up.

1099
01:30:22,232 --> 01:30:24,039
Okay, copy that!

1100
01:30:28,472 --> 01:30:30,100
Move, Captain.

1101
01:30:30,125 --> 01:30:32,671
I won't ask a second time.

1102
01:30:34,245 --> 01:30:38,380
- Look, I really don't want to hurt you.
- I wouldn't stress about it.

1103
01:30:49,833 --> 01:30:54,041
- What the hell was that?
- Everyone's got a gimmick now.

1104
01:31:00,194 --> 01:31:03,819
You have a metal arm?
That is awesome, dude!

1105
01:31:04,547 --> 01:31:07,416
You have the right to remain silent!

1106
01:31:20,837 --> 01:31:24,566
Sorry, Cap. This won't kill you
but it ain't gonna tickle either.

1107
01:31:29,095 --> 01:31:32,448
- Wanda, I think you hurt Vision's feelings.
- You locked me in my room.

1108
01:31:32,473 --> 01:31:34,311
Okay.
First, that's an exaggeration.

1109
01:31:34,336 --> 01:31:36,506
Second, I did it to protect you.

1110
01:31:36,531 --> 01:31:38,141
- Hey, Clint.
- Hey, man.

1111
01:31:38,166 --> 01:31:41,636
Clearly retirement doesn't suit you,
get tired of shooting golf?

1112
01:31:41,661 --> 01:31:44,809
Well, I played 18,
I shot 18.

1113
01:31:45,086 --> 01:31:47,229
Just can't seem to miss.

1114
01:31:49,078 --> 01:31:52,060
- First time for everything.
- Made you look.

1115
01:32:01,966 --> 01:32:06,070
- <font color="#ff80c0">Multiple contusions detected.</font>
- Yeah, I detected that too.

1116
01:32:13,127 --> 01:32:14,593
Oh god.

1117
01:32:15,411 --> 01:32:17,890
Hey buddy, I think you lost this!

1118
01:32:29,107 --> 01:32:31,828
- Are those wings carbon fiber?
- Is this stuff coming out of you?

1119
01:32:31,853 --> 01:32:33,930
That would explain
the rigidity flexibility ratio

1120
01:32:33,955 --> 01:32:35,603
which, gotta say,
that's awesome man.

1121
01:32:35,628 --> 01:32:37,125
I don’t know if
you’ve been a fight before

1122
01:32:37,150 --> 01:32:40,864
- but there's usually not this much talking.
- Alright, sorry, my bad.

1123
01:32:45,168 --> 01:32:46,581
Guys, look.
I'd love to keep this up

1124
01:32:46,606 --> 01:32:49,347
but I've only got one job here today
and I gotta impress Mr. Stark,

1125
01:32:49,372 --> 01:32:51,931
so, I’m really sorry.

1126
01:32:53,714 --> 01:32:55,041
Wwahhhh !

1127
01:32:55,066 --> 01:32:57,420
You couldn't have done that earlier?

1128
01:32:57,836 --> 01:32:59,590
I hate you.

1129
01:33:06,544 --> 01:33:08,346
Captain, heads up!

1130
01:33:09,694 --> 01:33:11,468
Throw it at this.

1131
01:33:11,493 --> 01:33:12,871
Now!

1132
01:33:16,291 --> 01:33:18,069
Oh, come on!

1133
01:33:20,550 --> 01:33:23,190
Oh, man.
I thought it was a water truck.

1134
01:33:23,215 --> 01:33:25,541
Uh... sorry.

1135
01:33:27,337 --> 01:33:29,475
Alright.
Now, I'm pissed.

1136
01:33:29,609 --> 01:33:31,096
Is this, part of the plan?

1137
01:33:31,121 --> 01:33:34,558
Well, my plan was to go easy on them.
You want to switch it up?

1138
01:33:36,708 --> 01:33:38,347
There's our ride.

1139
01:33:39,758 --> 01:33:41,281
Come on!

1140
01:33:49,714 --> 01:33:51,685
Captain Rogers.

1141
01:33:51,974 --> 01:33:55,557
I know you believe
what you're doing is right.

1142
01:33:55,605 --> 01:34:00,347
But, for the collective good,
you must surrender now.

1143
01:34:17,063 --> 01:34:18,930
What do we do, Cap?

1144
01:34:19,809 --> 01:34:21,345
We fight.

1145
01:34:22,831 --> 01:34:24,900
This isn't going to end well.

1146
01:34:31,101 --> 01:34:32,706
They're not stopping.

1147
01:34:32,731 --> 01:34:34,327
Neither are we.

1148
01:35:04,774 --> 01:35:08,349
- We're still friends, right?
- Depends on how hard you hit me.

1149
01:35:16,416 --> 01:35:18,642
You're pulling your punches.

1150
01:35:22,459 --> 01:35:26,084
- I didn't kill your father.
- Then why did you run?

1151
01:35:32,924 --> 01:35:34,937
Take that!

1152
01:35:43,802 --> 01:35:45,852
That thing does not obey
the laws of physics at all.

1153
01:35:45,877 --> 01:35:48,001
Look kid. There's a lot going on here
that you don't understand.

1154
01:35:48,026 --> 01:35:49,890
Stark said you'd say that.

1155
01:35:59,225 --> 01:36:01,750
He also said to go for your legs.

1156
01:36:12,974 --> 01:36:14,942
Clint, can you get him off me?

1157
01:36:14,967 --> 01:36:17,583
- Grapple in?
- Yeah. No, I'm good.

1158
01:36:17,608 --> 01:36:20,373
I'm good, arrow-guy.
Let's go. Let's go!

1159
01:36:41,192 --> 01:36:42,711
Did Stark tell you anything else?

1160
01:36:42,736 --> 01:36:45,928
That you're wrong.
You think you're right.

1161
01:36:45,953 --> 01:36:48,056
And that makes you dangerous.

1162
01:36:52,620 --> 01:36:54,622
I guess you got a point.

1163
01:36:58,966 --> 01:37:01,988
You got heart, kid.
Where're you from?

1164
01:37:02,130 --> 01:37:03,636
Queens.

1165
01:37:04,646 --> 01:37:06,076
Brooklyn.

1166
01:37:12,039 --> 01:37:14,227
- Friday?
- <font color="#ff80c0">We have some weapon systems offline.</font>

1167
01:37:14,252 --> 01:37:15,289
They what?

1168
01:37:15,314 --> 01:37:17,761
Oh, you're gonna have to
take this into the shop.

1169
01:37:17,786 --> 01:37:21,206
- Who's speaking?
- It's your conscience.

1170
01:37:21,231 --> 01:37:23,153
We don't talk a lot these days.

1171
01:37:23,178 --> 01:37:24,478
Friday?

1172
01:37:26,933 --> 01:37:28,449
Oh oh.

1173
01:37:29,933 --> 01:37:31,526
Oh boy.

1174
01:37:40,114 --> 01:37:42,451
- We got to go.
- That guy's probably in Siberia by now.

1175
01:37:42,476 --> 01:37:44,022
I'm gonna draw all the fliers.

1176
01:37:44,047 --> 01:37:45,646
I'll take Vision.
You get to the jet.

1177
01:37:45,671 --> 01:37:49,244
No, you get to the jet!
Both of you!

1178
01:37:50,819 --> 01:37:52,420
The rest of us
aren't getting out of here.

1179
01:37:52,445 --> 01:37:55,199
As much as I hate to admit it,
if we're gonna win this one,

1180
01:37:55,224 --> 01:37:56,876
some of us might
have to lose it.

1181
01:37:56,901 --> 01:37:59,270
This isn't the real fight, Steve.

1182
01:37:59,303 --> 01:38:03,909
- Alright, Sam, what's the plan?
- We need a diversion, something big.

1183
01:38:04,959 --> 01:38:08,141
I got something kind of big,
but I can't hold it very long.

1184
01:38:08,166 --> 01:38:10,471
On my signal, run like hell.

1185
01:38:10,496 --> 01:38:13,478
And if I tear myself in half,
don't come back for me.

1186
01:38:13,503 --> 01:38:15,709
- He's tearing himself in half?
- You're sure about this guy?

1187
01:38:15,734 --> 01:38:18,452
I do it all the time.
I mean once...

1188
01:38:18,477 --> 01:38:21,480
... in a lab.
And I passed out.

1189
01:38:39,212 --> 01:38:41,526
Holy shit!

1190
01:38:44,765 --> 01:38:47,995
Okay, tiny dude is big now.
He's big now.

1191
01:38:48,848 --> 01:38:50,438
I guess that's the signal.

1192
01:38:50,463 --> 01:38:52,568
Way to go, tic-tac!

1193
01:38:53,323 --> 01:38:56,014
Give me back my Rhodey.

1194
01:38:58,642 --> 01:39:00,195
I got him!

1195
01:39:22,131 --> 01:39:24,796
Okay. Anybody on our side
hiding any shocking,

1196
01:39:24,821 --> 01:39:27,178
and fantastic abilities
they'd like to disclose,

1197
01:39:27,203 --> 01:39:29,454
I'm open to suggestion.

1198
01:39:36,309 --> 01:39:40,492
You want to get to them?
You got to go through me.

1199
01:40:06,206 --> 01:40:08,083
We haven't met yet.

1200
01:40:10,582 --> 01:40:13,193
- I'm Clint.
- I don't care.

1201
01:40:40,086 --> 01:40:41,819
Get off.

1202
01:40:55,685 --> 01:40:58,239
Something just flew in me!

1203
01:41:21,576 --> 01:41:23,355
You're not going to stop?

1204
01:41:23,380 --> 01:41:25,115
You know I can't.

1205
01:41:25,140 --> 01:41:27,188
I'm going to regret this.

1206
01:41:30,149 --> 01:41:31,637
Go.

1207
01:41:36,738 --> 01:41:39,636
Hey guys.
You ever see that really old movie?

1208
01:41:39,661 --> 01:41:42,557
- Empire Strikes Back?
- Jesus Tony, how old is this guy?

1209
01:41:42,589 --> 01:41:45,825
I don't know, I didn't carbon date him.
He's on the young side.

1210
01:41:46,987 --> 01:41:48,970
You know that part?

1211
01:41:49,063 --> 01:41:53,736
When they're on the snow planet?
With the walking thingies?

1212
01:41:55,118 --> 01:41:58,339
- Maybe the kid's on to something.
- I know. Tony, go high.

1213
01:42:05,963 --> 01:42:07,140
YES!

1214
01:42:07,165 --> 01:42:09,650
Ha ha!
That was awesome!

1215
01:42:23,785 --> 01:42:27,042
Does anyone have any orange slices?

1216
01:42:32,334 --> 01:42:34,259
- Kid, you alright?
- Hey!

1217
01:42:35,357 --> 01:42:36,957
- Get of me!
- Guess who?

1218
01:42:36,982 --> 01:42:38,648
- Hi.
- Oh.

1219
01:42:38,673 --> 01:42:40,123
- Hey man.
- Yeah.

1220
01:42:40,148 --> 01:42:41,378
- That was scary.
- Yeah.

1221
01:42:41,403 --> 01:42:43,418
- You're done. Alright?
- What?

1222
01:42:43,443 --> 01:42:44,931
- You did a good job.
-  No, I'm good. I'm fine.

1223
01:42:44,956 --> 01:42:46,311
- Stay down.
- No, it's good I gotta get him back!

1224
01:42:46,336 --> 01:42:47,726
You're going home
or I'll call Aunt May!

1225
01:42:47,751 --> 01:42:49,051
You're done!

1226
01:42:49,076 --> 01:42:50,321
Wait.

1227
01:42:50,346 --> 01:42:53,700
Mr. Stark, wait!
I'm not done, I'm not...

1228
01:42:55,456 --> 01:42:57,257
Okay, I'm done.

1229
01:43:13,906 --> 01:43:16,727
I said that I'd help you find him,
not catch him.

1230
01:43:16,752 --> 01:43:18,737
There is a difference.

1231
01:43:24,624 --> 01:43:26,635
I'm sorry.

1232
01:43:26,756 --> 01:43:28,360
Me too.

1233
01:43:28,730 --> 01:43:32,152
It's as I said, catastrophe.

1234
01:43:44,741 --> 01:43:47,464
Vision, I got a bandit on my six.

1235
01:43:51,272 --> 01:43:52,839
Vision, do you copy?

1236
01:43:52,864 --> 01:43:55,595
Target his thrusters,
turn him into a glider.

1237
01:44:09,598 --> 01:44:11,112
Rhodey?

1238
01:44:12,502 --> 01:44:14,669
Tony, I'm flying a dead stick.

1239
01:44:22,571 --> 01:44:24,222
RHODES!

1240
01:44:36,224 --> 01:44:37,857
Read vitals.

1241
01:44:38,040 --> 01:44:42,200
<font color="#ff80c0"><i>Heartbeat detected.
Emergency medical is on it's way.</i></font>

1242
01:44:46,594 --> 01:44:48,350
I'm sorry.

1243
01:45:05,082 --> 01:45:06,947
Good morning.
Room service.

1244
01:45:06,972 --> 01:45:09,233
Good morning, Mrs. Leben.

1245
01:45:09,258 --> 01:45:12,202
- I mean, room 201.
- <i> Good morning, Mr. Muller.</i>

1246
01:45:12,227 --> 01:45:14,822
<i>Bacon and black coffee again?</i>

1247
01:45:15,137 --> 01:45:17,409
You know it well.

1248
01:45:18,224 --> 01:45:20,919
Hello, I brought breakfast.

1249
01:45:21,183 --> 01:45:23,209
Can I come in?

1250
01:45:31,178 --> 01:45:32,971
Mr Muller?

1251
01:45:35,924 --> 01:45:37,885
Mr Muller?

1252
01:45:39,933 --> 01:45:41,621
Oh God!

1253
01:45:47,416 --> 01:45:49,793
What's gonna happen to your friends?

1254
01:45:57,571 --> 01:46:01,484
Whatever it is, 
I'll deal with it.

1255
01:46:04,366 --> 01:46:07,277
I don't know if I'm worth 
all this, Steve.

1256
01:46:13,792 --> 01:46:16,187
What you did all those years...

1257
01:46:16,539 --> 01:46:18,242
It wasn't you.

1258
01:46:18,632 --> 01:46:20,801
You didn't have a choice.

1259
01:46:21,808 --> 01:46:23,297
I know.

1260
01:46:25,984 --> 01:46:27,908
But I did it.

1261
01:46:42,056 --> 01:46:44,715
Vision, how did this happen?

1262
01:46:44,740 --> 01:46:46,954
I became distracted.

1263
01:46:49,116 --> 01:46:51,600
I didn't think that was possible.

1264
01:46:52,611 --> 01:46:54,740
Neither did I.

1265
01:47:10,568 --> 01:47:13,858
The doctor said he shattered 
L4 to S1.

1266
01:47:13,883 --> 01:47:16,739
Extreme laceration in the spinal cord.

1267
01:47:16,764 --> 01:47:20,055
Probably looking at some form of paralysis.

1268
01:47:22,835 --> 01:47:24,868
Steve's not going to stop.

1269
01:47:24,893 --> 01:47:27,420
If you don't rein in, then Rhodey 
is going to be the best case scenario.

1270
01:47:27,445 --> 01:47:29,928
- You let them go, Nat.
- We played this wrong.

1271
01:47:29,953 --> 01:47:31,378
We?

1272
01:47:31,996 --> 01:47:34,654
Boy. It must be hard to shake the
whole double agent thing, huh?

1273
01:47:34,679 --> 01:47:36,782
Sticks in the DNA.

1274
01:47:37,716 --> 01:47:43,322
And you incapable of letting go 
of your ego for 1 god damn second.

1275
01:47:46,905 --> 01:47:52,316
T'Challa told Ross what you did,
 so, they're coming for you.

1276
01:47:53,218 --> 01:47:56,152
I'm not the one who needs 
to watch their back.

1277
01:48:04,398 --> 01:48:05,762
What am I looking at, Friday?

1278
01:48:05,787 --> 01:48:08,857
<font color="#ff80c0">Priority upload from Berlin police.</font>

1279
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:13,434
Fire up the chopper.

1280
01:48:18,691 --> 01:48:22,855
<font color="#ff80c0">The Task Force called for a psychiatrist
as soon as Barnes was captured.</font>

1281
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:26,686
<font color="#ff80c0">The UN dispatched Dr. Theo Broussard 
from Geneva within the hour.</font>

1282
01:48:26,718 --> 01:48:28,288
<font color="#ff80c0">He was met by this man.</font>

1283
01:48:28,313 --> 01:48:31,205
- Did you run a facial recognition yet?
-  <font color="#ff80c0">What do I look like?</font>

1284
01:48:31,230 --> 01:48:32,803
I don't know, but I'm
picturing a red head.

1285
01:48:32,828 --> 01:48:34,808
<font color="#ff80c0">You must be thinking
I'm someone else.</font>

1286
01:48:34,833 --> 01:48:35,830
I must be.

1287
01:48:35,855 --> 01:48:39,507
<font color="#ff80c0">The fake doctor is actually 
Colonel Helmut Zemo</font>

1288
01:48:39,691 --> 01:48:42,140
<font color="#ff80c0">Sokovian intelligence.</font>

1289
01:48:43,040 --> 01:48:48,023
<font color="#ff80c0">Zemo ran EKO Skorpion, 
a Sokovian covert kill squad.</font>

1290
01:48:49,637 --> 01:48:51,144
So, what happened to the real Broussard?

1291
01:48:51,169 --> 01:48:53,551
<font color="#ff80c0">He was found dead 
in a Berlin hotel room.</font>

1292
01:48:53,576 --> 01:48:56,353
<font color="#ff80c0">The police also found a wig 
and facial prosthesis</font>

1293
01:48:56,378 --> 01:49:01,380
<font color="#ff80c0">approximating the appearance 
of one James Buchanan Barnes.</font>

1294
01:49:01,405 --> 01:49:03,437
Son of a bitch.

1295
01:49:05,161 --> 01:49:07,805
- Get this to Ross.
- <font color="#ff80c0">Yes, Boss.</font>

1296
01:50:40,523 --> 01:50:44,920
This is the Raft prison control.
You are clear for landing, Mr. Stark.

1297
01:51:02,911 --> 01:51:05,827
RAFT PRISON

1298
01:51:17,594 --> 01:51:19,575
So? 
Did you get the files?

1299
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:22,885
Let's reroute the satellites, and start 
facial scanning for this Zemo guy.

1300
01:51:22,911 --> 01:51:27,573
You seriously think I'm gonna listen 
to you even after that fiasco in Leipzig?

1301
01:51:27,648 --> 01:51:30,286
You're luck you're not in 
one of these cells.

1302
01:52:00,786 --> 01:52:06,146
The futurist, gentlemen!
The futurist is here!

1303
01:52:06,171 --> 01:52:08,490
He sees all!

1304
01:52:08,515 --> 01:52:12,125
He knows what's best for you,
whether your like it or not.

1305
01:52:12,150 --> 01:52:13,486
Give me a break, Barton.

1306
01:52:13,511 --> 01:52:16,072
I have no idea they'll put you 
in here, come on.

1307
01:52:16,892 --> 01:52:19,355
Yeah, well, you knew 
they'll put us somewhere, Tony.

1308
01:52:19,396 --> 01:52:22,332
Yeah. But, not some 
super max floating ocean pokey.

1309
01:52:22,357 --> 01:52:25,040
You know, this place is for maniacs.
This is a place for...

1310
01:52:25,065 --> 01:52:26,592
Criminals?

1311
01:52:27,671 --> 01:52:29,731
Criminals, Tony.

1312
01:52:29,756 --> 01:52:32,610
I think that's the word
you're looking for.

1313
01:52:33,647 --> 01:52:34,969
Right?

1314
01:52:35,278 --> 01:52:39,117
It ain't used to mean me,
or Sam, or Wanda.

1315
01:52:39,142 --> 01:52:42,179
- But, here we are.
- 'Cause you broke the law.

1316
01:52:42,204 --> 01:52:44,222
- Yeah.
- I didn't make you.

1317
01:52:44,424 --> 01:52:46,568
- The law. The law.
- You read it, you broke it.

1318
01:52:46,593 --> 01:52:47,620
The law. The law.
The law.

1319
01:52:47,645 --> 01:52:50,516
Alright, you're all grown ups.
You got a wife and kids.

1320
01:52:50,541 --> 01:52:54,240
I don't understand. Why didn't you think 
about them before you choose the wrong side?

1321
01:52:54,937 --> 01:52:57,382
You better watch your back 
on this guy.

1322
01:52:58,244 --> 01:53:00,417
Chances are he's going to break it.

1323
01:53:01,909 --> 01:53:05,475
Hank Pym always said,
you never can trust a Stark.

1324
01:53:05,795 --> 01:53:07,381
Who are you?

1325
01:53:07,831 --> 01:53:09,768
Come on, man.

1326
01:53:11,168 --> 01:53:12,359
How's Rhodes?

1327
01:53:12,384 --> 01:53:13,955
We're flying him to
Columbia Medical tomorrow.

1328
01:53:13,980 --> 01:53:17,346
So...
Fingers cross.

1329
01:53:18,244 --> 01:53:20,540
What do you need?
They feed you yet?

1330
01:53:21,943 --> 01:53:24,001
You're the good cop now?

1331
01:53:24,026 --> 01:53:25,894
I'm just a guy who needs 
to know where Steve went.

1332
01:53:25,919 --> 01:53:27,739
Well, you better go get a bad cop,

1333
01:53:27,764 --> 01:53:29,639
because you would have to go 
Mark 'Terminal' on my ass

1334
01:53:29,663 --> 01:53:31,975
to get information out of me.

1335
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,272
Oh, I just knocked the 'A' 
out of their 'AV'.

1336
01:53:34,296 --> 01:53:37,849
We got about 30 seconds before 
they realized it's not their equipment.

1337
01:53:38,089 --> 01:53:41,109
What did you do?
Get it back up!

1338
01:53:42,050 --> 01:53:43,513
Just look.

1339
01:53:43,953 --> 01:53:48,687
Because that is the fellow who is 
suppose to interrogate Barnes.

1340
01:53:49,153 --> 01:53:51,778
Clearly, I made a mistake.
Sam, I was wrong.

1341
01:53:51,803 --> 01:53:53,247
That's a first.

1342
01:53:53,271 --> 01:53:57,719
Cap is definitely off the reservation and
he's about to need all the help he can get.

1343
01:53:57,907 --> 01:53:59,530
We don't know each other very well.
You don't have to...

1344
01:53:59,555 --> 01:54:01,703
Hey.
It's alright.

1345
01:54:09,471 --> 01:54:11,363
Look, I will tell you.

1346
01:54:11,388 --> 01:54:15,035
But you have to go alone
and as a friend.

1347
01:54:16,156 --> 01:54:17,709
Easy.

1348
01:54:20,309 --> 01:54:23,308
Stark, did he give you anything on Rogers?

1349
01:54:23,341 --> 01:54:25,663
No, he told me to go to hell.
I'm going back to the compound instead.

1350
01:54:25,688 --> 01:54:28,792
But, you can call me anytime.

1351
01:54:28,817 --> 01:54:31,743
I'll put you on hold,
I like to watch the line blink.

1352
01:55:39,775 --> 01:55:41,557
You remember that time
we had to ride back from

1353
01:55:41,582 --> 01:55:43,827
Rockaway Beach in the back
of that freezer truck?

1354
01:55:43,852 --> 01:55:47,493
Was that the time we used 
our train money to buy hot dogs?

1355
01:55:47,517 --> 01:55:51,509
You blew 3 bucks trying to win
that stuffed bear for a redhead.

1356
01:55:51,535 --> 01:55:54,688
- What was her name again?
- Dolores. You called her Da.

1357
01:55:54,713 --> 01:55:56,610
She's got to be 
a hundred years old by now.

1358
01:55:56,635 --> 01:55:58,762
So are we, pal.

1359
01:56:07,449 --> 01:56:09,583
He can't been here
for more than a few hours.

1360
01:56:09,608 --> 01:56:11,780
Long enough to wake them up.

1361
01:56:53,576 --> 01:56:54,990
You ready?

1362
01:56:55,015 --> 01:56:56,559
Yeah.

1363
01:57:09,824 --> 01:57:12,052
You seem more defensively.

1364
01:57:12,808 --> 01:57:14,873
It's been a long day.

1365
01:57:14,898 --> 01:57:16,829
At ease, soldier.
I'm not coming after you.

1366
01:57:16,854 --> 01:57:18,945
Then why are you here?

1367
01:57:19,257 --> 01:57:21,580
Maybe, your story is not so crazy.

1368
01:57:22,205 --> 01:57:23,733
Maybe.

1369
01:57:24,696 --> 01:57:27,764
Ross has no idea I'm here, 
I like to keep it that way.

1370
01:57:28,535 --> 01:57:30,935
Otherwise, I got to arrest myself.

1371
01:57:31,916 --> 01:57:34,366
Well, that sounds like
a lot of paper work.

1372
01:57:37,039 --> 01:57:40,391
- It's good to see you, Tony.
- Me too, Cap.

1373
01:57:40,571 --> 01:57:42,833
Make sure you can me,
you're killing me.

1374
01:57:42,869 --> 01:57:45,552
There's a truce here,
you can drop it.

1375
01:58:05,018 --> 01:58:07,980
- I got heat signatures.
- How many?

1376
01:58:08,754 --> 01:58:11,377
Uh, one.

1377
01:58:29,671 --> 01:58:34,023
If it's any comfort,
they died in their sleep.

1378
01:58:40,306 --> 01:58:43,407
Did you really think 
I wanted more of you?

1379
01:58:44,612 --> 01:58:46,579
What the hell?

1380
01:58:47,117 --> 01:58:52,284
I'm grateful to them though, 
they brought you here.

1381
01:58:56,304 --> 01:58:57,865
Please, Captain.

1382
01:58:57,898 --> 01:59:00,882
The Soviets built this chamber 
to withstand the launch blast of

1383
01:59:00,907 --> 01:59:02,728
no fewer than a 100 rockets.

1384
01:59:02,753 --> 01:59:04,609
I'm betting I can beat that.

1385
01:59:04,634 --> 01:59:06,949
Oh, I'm sure you could, Mr. Stark.

1386
01:59:06,974 --> 01:59:08,732
Given time.

1387
01:59:08,907 --> 01:59:10,724
But then you'll never know 
why you came.

1388
01:59:10,749 --> 01:59:14,084
You killed innocent people 
in Vienna just to bring us here?

1389
01:59:20,012 --> 01:59:24,223
I thought about nothing else
for over a year.

1390
01:59:24,502 --> 01:59:28,884
I studied you, 
I followed you.

1391
01:59:28,910 --> 01:59:32,929
But now that you are standing here, 
I just realized...

1392
01:59:34,887 --> 01:59:38,267
There's a bit of green 
in the blue of your eyes.

1393
01:59:39,766 --> 01:59:42,541
How nice to find a flaw.

1394
01:59:42,824 --> 01:59:44,750
You're Sokovian.

1395
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:47,108
Is that what this is about?

1396
01:59:47,133 --> 01:59:50,634
Sokovia was a failed state 
long before you blew it to hell.

1397
01:59:50,659 --> 01:59:52,161
No.

1398
01:59:53,140 --> 01:59:56,248
I'm here because I made a promise.

1399
01:59:59,471 --> 02:00:03,240
- You've lost someone.
- I've lost everyone.

1400
02:00:03,654 --> 02:00:05,710
And so will you.

1401
02:00:11,617 --> 02:00:15,641
An empire topple by its enemies
can rise again.

1402
02:00:16,102 --> 02:00:18,842
But one which crumples from within...

1403
02:00:19,887 --> 02:00:21,637
that's dead

1404
02:00:22,575 --> 02:00:24,247
... forever.

1405
02:00:32,130 --> 02:00:34,068
I know that road.

1406
02:00:34,357 --> 02:00:36,347
[ 16 December 1991 ]

02:00:36,372 --> 02:00:38,112
What is this?

1408
02:01:00,490 --> 02:01:02,325
Help my wife.

1409
02:01:03,354 --> 02:01:06,090
Please.
Help her.

1410
02:01:11,281 --> 02:01:13,354
Sergeant Barnes.

1411
02:01:13,979 --> 02:01:15,745
Howard.

1412
02:01:22,881 --> 02:01:24,678
Howard!

1413
02:01:44,151 --> 02:01:45,533
Help.

1414
02:02:01,527 --> 02:02:03,232
Tony.
Tony.

1415
02:02:12,199 --> 02:02:14,002
Did you know?

1416
02:02:15,843 --> 02:02:17,208
I didn't know it was him.

1417
02:02:17,233 --> 02:02:20,774
Don't shit me, Rogers! 
Did you know?

1418
02:02:24,134 --> 02:02:25,686
Yes.

1419
02:03:21,531 --> 02:03:23,174
Get out of here!

1420
02:03:34,135 --> 02:03:36,412
It wasn't him, Tony. 
Hydra had controlled of his mind!

1421
02:03:36,437 --> 02:03:37,628
Move!

1422
02:03:37,653 --> 02:03:39,145
It wasn't him!

1423
02:03:47,206 --> 02:03:49,511
<font color="#ff80c0">Left boot-jet failing.</font>

1424
02:03:49,640 --> 02:03:52,118
<font color="#ff80c0">Flight systems compromised.</font>

1425
02:03:52,143 --> 02:03:53,996
I hate that crap.

1426
02:04:07,094 --> 02:04:09,533
He's not going to stop.
Go.

1427
02:04:31,905 --> 02:04:34,790
- Come on. Come on.
- <font color="#ff80c0">Targeting systems non-responds.</font>

1428
02:04:34,815 --> 02:04:36,392
I'm eye balling him.

1429
02:04:54,511 --> 02:04:56,368
Do you even remember them?

1430
02:04:56,393 --> 02:04:58,570
I remember all of them.

1431
02:05:20,904 --> 02:05:23,040
This isn't going to change 
what happened.

1432
02:05:23,066 --> 02:05:27,060
I don't care.
He killed my mom.

1433
02:06:27,678 --> 02:06:31,047
You should've seen his little face.
Just try, okay?

1434
02:06:31,072 --> 02:06:35,023
I'm going to bed. 
I love you.

1435
02:06:42,888 --> 02:06:45,505
I almost kill the wrong man.

1436
02:06:46,453 --> 02:06:48,663
Hardly an innocent one.

1437
02:06:48,695 --> 02:06:50,818
Is this what you wanted?

1438
02:06:51,242 --> 02:06:54,053
To see them ripped each other apart.

1439
02:06:57,664 --> 02:07:00,661
My father lived outside the city.

1440
02:07:01,209 --> 02:07:03,872
I thought we would be safe there.

1441
02:07:04,125 --> 02:07:06,213
My son was excited.

1442
02:07:06,238 --> 02:07:09,554
He could see the Iron Man
from the car window.

1443
02:07:09,907 --> 02:07:13,434
And I told my wife,
"Don't worry."

1444
02:07:13,459 --> 02:07:17,781
"They are fighting in the city.
We are miles from harm."

1445
02:07:19,724 --> 02:07:25,701
When the dust cleared,
and the screaming stopped.

1446
02:07:25,832 --> 02:07:30,682
It took me two days 
after I found their bodies.

1447
02:07:32,216 --> 02:07:34,121
My father...

1448
02:07:34,688 --> 02:07:38,810
still holding my wife 
and son in his arms.

1449
02:07:42,508 --> 02:07:44,763
And the Avengers...

1450
02:07:45,685 --> 02:07:47,601
they went home.

1451
02:07:49,280 --> 02:07:51,782
I knew I couldn't kill them.

1452
02:07:51,807 --> 02:07:54,836
More powerful men than me have tried.

1453
02:07:55,214 --> 02:07:59,762
But, if I could get them 
to kill each other?

1454
02:08:03,287 --> 02:08:05,932
I'm sorry about your father.

1455
02:08:06,495 --> 02:08:08,551
He seemed a good man.

1456
02:08:10,073 --> 02:08:12,551
With a dutiful son.

1457
02:08:16,484 --> 02:08:19,308
Vengeance has consumed you.

1458
02:08:20,761 --> 02:08:23,080
It's consuming them.

1459
02:08:27,013 --> 02:08:30,032
I'm not letting it consume me.

1460
02:08:33,007 --> 02:08:36,006
Justice will come soon enough.

1461
02:08:38,557 --> 02:08:40,581
Tell that to the dead.

1462
02:08:44,848 --> 02:08:47,764
The living are not done 
with you yet.

1463
02:08:50,227 --> 02:08:53,050
<font color="#ff80c0">You can't beat him hand to hand.</font>

1464
02:08:54,062 --> 02:08:55,932
Analyse his fighting pattern.

1465
02:08:55,957 --> 02:08:57,611
<font color="#ff80c0">Scanning!</font>

1466
02:09:01,412 --> 02:09:03,379
<font color="#ff80c0">Countermeasures ready.</font>

1467
02:09:04,499 --> 02:09:06,266
Let's kick his ass.

1468
02:09:19,244 --> 02:09:21,409
He's my friend.

1469
02:09:21,434 --> 02:09:23,163
So was I.

1470
02:09:29,471 --> 02:09:32,082
Stay down.
Final warning.

1471
02:09:45,876 --> 02:09:48,021
I can do this all day.

1472
02:10:54,251 --> 02:10:56,390
That shield does not belong to you.

1473
02:10:58,193 --> 02:11:02,371
You don't deserve it!
My father made that shield!

1474
02:11:37,903 --> 02:11:39,605
Meals at eight and five.

1475
02:11:39,630 --> 02:11:42,299
Toilet privileges, twice a day.

1476
02:11:43,732 --> 02:11:46,547
Raise your voice, zap.

1477
02:11:46,643 --> 02:11:48,821
Touch the glass, zap.

1478
02:11:48,846 --> 02:11:51,043
You step out of line,
you deal with me.

1479
02:11:51,068 --> 02:11:54,280
Please, step out of line.
Hm?

1480
02:11:55,469 --> 02:11:57,307
So, how's it feel?

1481
02:11:57,685 --> 02:12:00,467
Send all that crime,
all that effort.

1482
02:12:01,039 --> 02:12:05,117
And, you seem to fail.

1483
02:12:05,467 --> 02:12:07,973
So spectacular.

1484
02:12:11,302 --> 02:12:12,862
Did it?

1485
02:12:38,734 --> 02:12:40,087
- That's just for the test.
- Yeah.

1486
02:12:40,113 --> 02:12:42,344
Give me some feedback.
Anything you can think of.

1487
02:12:42,377 --> 02:12:45,653
Shock absorption.
Lateral movement.

1488
02:12:45,857 --> 02:12:47,073
Cup holder?

1489
02:12:47,098 --> 02:12:49,718
No, I'm thinking about
some AC down there.

1490
02:12:52,446 --> 02:12:53,564
Give me your hand.

1491
02:12:53,599 --> 02:12:55,829
No, no, don't. 
Don't help me. Don't help me.

1492
02:13:11,413 --> 02:13:16,000
138.
138 combat missions.

1493
02:13:16,141 --> 02:13:18,304
That's how many of my fly time.

1494
02:13:18,329 --> 02:13:21,568
Every one of them could've been 
my last, but I flew em.

1495
02:13:23,441 --> 02:13:25,605
To the fight needed to be fought.

1496
02:13:25,630 --> 02:13:27,597
It's the same with these Accords.

1497
02:13:27,622 --> 02:13:31,450
I signed because it was 
the right thing to do.

1498
02:13:32,960 --> 02:13:35,748
And, yeah, this sucks. 
This is...

1499
02:13:36,368 --> 02:13:38,316
This is a bad beat.

1500
02:13:40,438 --> 02:13:42,851
But it hadn't change my mind.

1501
02:13:43,441 --> 02:13:45,006
What do you think?

1502
02:13:55,506 --> 02:13:57,421
- You okay?
- Oh yeah.

1503
02:14:00,136 --> 02:14:03,008
Are you Tony "Stank"?

1504
02:14:03,110 --> 02:14:07,464
Yes, this is-this is Tony "Stank"!
You're in the right place.

1505
02:14:07,489 --> 02:14:09,386
Thank you for that!

1506
02:14:09,411 --> 02:14:11,356
- I'm never dropping that, by the way.
- Oh my god.

1507
02:14:11,381 --> 02:14:15,539
Table for one, Mr. "Stank".
Please, by the bathroom.

1508
02:14:21,701 --> 02:14:23,191
Tony.

1509
02:14:23,549 --> 02:14:25,449
I'm glad you're back 
at the compound.

1510
02:14:25,474 --> 02:14:28,875
I don't like the idea of you 
rattling around in a mansion by yourself

1511
02:14:28,900 --> 02:14:30,738
We all need family.

1512
02:14:31,600 --> 02:14:35,619
The Avengers are yours,
maybe more so than mine.

1513
02:14:36,091 --> 02:14:39,290
I've been on my own
since I was 18.

1514
02:14:39,458 --> 02:14:44,177
I never really fit in anywhere.
even in the army.

1515
02:14:45,636 --> 02:14:50,864
My fate's in... people, I guess.
Individuals.

1516
02:14:51,073 --> 02:14:54,249
And, I am happy to say
for the most part,

1517
02:14:54,374 --> 02:14:56,366
they haven't let me down.

1518
02:14:58,102 --> 02:15:00,973
Which is why I can't 
let them down either.

1519
02:15:04,452 --> 02:15:07,990
Lives can be replaced,
but, maybe they shouldn't.

1520
02:15:09,805 --> 02:15:12,001
I know I hurt you, Tony.

1521
02:15:12,101 --> 02:15:17,564
I guessed I thought by not telling you 
about your parents, I was sparing you. But...

1522
02:15:17,757 --> 02:15:20,888
I can see now that 
I was really sparing myself.

1523
02:15:20,913 --> 02:15:22,994
And I'm sorry.

1524
02:15:23,019 --> 02:15:25,490
Hopefully one day
you can understand.

1525
02:15:26,001 --> 02:15:29,540
I wished we'd agree on the Accords,
I really do.

1526
02:15:29,565 --> 02:15:31,022
I know you're doing
what you believe in.

1527
02:15:31,047 --> 02:15:34,136
And that's all any of us can do.
That's all any of us should.

1528
02:15:34,161 --> 02:15:36,392
<font color="#ff80c0">Priority call from Secretary Ross.</font>

at the RAFT prison.</font>

1530
02:15:39,916 --> 02:15:41,674
Yeah, put him through.

1531
02:15:43,270 --> 02:15:45,051
- Tony, we have a problem.
- Ah, please hold.

1532
02:15:45,076 --> 02:15:47,346
No.
Don't...

1533
02:15:49,279 --> 02:15:51,806
So, no matter what.

1534
02:15:51,831 --> 02:15:54,686
I promise you,
if you need us,

1535
02:15:55,471 --> 02:15:57,389
if you need me,

1536
02:16:02,233 --> 02:16:03,886
I'll be there.

1537
02:16:19,421 --> 02:16:22,296
<font color="#ff8080">Captain America</font>

1538
02:16:34,776 --> 02:16:36,845
- Sure about this?
- Yeah.

1539
02:16:37,198 --> 02:16:39,704
I can't trust my own mind.

1540
02:16:42,174 --> 02:16:45,419
So, until they figure out how to 
get this stuff out of my head

1541
02:16:45,444 --> 02:16:48,260
I think going back under 
is the best thing,

1542
02:16:48,285 --> 02:16:50,094
... for everyone.

1543
02:17:11,713 --> 02:17:13,796
Thank you for your help.

1544
02:17:15,590 --> 02:17:17,859
Your friend and my father,

1545
02:17:17,884 --> 02:17:20,885
they are both victims.

1546
02:17:21,600 --> 02:17:24,943
If I could help one of them
to find peace...

1547
02:17:28,247 --> 02:17:30,536
If they find out he's here,

1548
02:17:31,182 --> 02:17:33,180
they will come to take him.

1549
02:17:34,919 --> 02:17:36,985
Let them try.

1550
