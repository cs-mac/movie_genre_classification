1
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,549
Oh, shit.

2
00:01:08,287 --> 00:01:09,531
Duffy split.

3
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,468
Yeah, fuckin Duffy, Cavanagh, Tyrell

4
00:01:12,542 --> 00:01:14,778
Duffy rolls outta here
in a brand new Cadillac.

5
00:01:14,846 --> 00:01:18,588
Has the nerve to ask me to clean out
his fucking locker and save it for him.

6
00:01:18,654 --> 00:01:20,661
Probably has dirty
pictures of his wife.

7
00:01:20,734 --> 00:01:22,522
I don't know what
the fuck is in here.

8
00:01:29,309 --> 00:01:30,520
Uh-huh.

9
00:01:30,589 --> 00:01:32,531
He does have dirty
pictures of his wife.

10
00:01:32,605 --> 00:01:34,744
Yes. He does.

11
00:01:34,813 --> 00:01:37,714
Fuck he met her at hooters.

12
00:01:37,789 --> 00:01:39,862
You like that, huh?

13
00:01:39,932 --> 00:01:43,228
All right. Here is
what I'm gonna do.

14
00:01:43,292 --> 00:01:44,951
I'm gonna keep them.

15
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,288
Well, now, I gotta
answer to Duffy for that.

16
00:01:47,356 --> 00:01:48,665
I'll answer to him.

17
00:01:48,732 --> 00:01:50,771
I mean he is a duffus but
he's not a bad guy.

18
00:01:50,843 --> 00:01:54,640
Fuck Duffy. Just fuck
him. Fuck all of them.

19
00:01:56,059 --> 00:01:59,158
Five copies of
an arrest report.

20
00:01:59,227 --> 00:02:02,904
If the prisoner was transported, there
wouldn't still be five copies here.

21
00:02:02,971 --> 00:02:05,970
Duffy might've left him downstairs.
What's his name? Chavez.

22
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,930
Let's go find him.

23
00:02:14,778 --> 00:02:16,207
Who's there?

24
00:02:17,978 --> 00:02:21,327
It's strange, 'cause the manifest
says the prisoners all evacuated.

25
00:02:21,402 --> 00:02:23,473
Anything's possible
in this storm.

26
00:02:23,545 --> 00:02:25,880
I feel a bet coming on.
Shall we open the casino?

27
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:27,057
Please.

28
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:30,511
All right. Up to his nose by 4:00.

29
00:02:30,585 --> 00:02:32,593
What the fuck took you
so long, man? Please.

30
00:02:32,665 --> 00:02:34,257
Please what, shitbird?

31
00:02:34,328 --> 00:02:36,499
Get me the fuck outta here,
man. The water's rising.

32
00:02:36,568 --> 00:02:39,732
It's been rising for like three
hours. It's already up to my neck.

33
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:44,469
I'm not gonna be able to stand here long,
man. I'll drown. The water doesn't stop.

34
00:02:44,535 --> 00:02:48,758
Get me the fuck outta here. There's
fucking snakes and shit in this water.

35
00:02:48,824 --> 00:02:53,461
Twenty bucks and the Polaroid
he says nothing before five.

36
00:02:53,527 --> 00:02:57,520
Twenty bucks. What the fuck is that? Let's
make it worth our while, at least. A dime.

37
00:02:57,590 --> 00:02:59,281
I'm not betting
you $1,000.

38
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,878
Five hundred.

39
00:03:00,952 --> 00:03:03,985
Get me the fuck outta here,
man! The water keeps rising.

40
00:03:04,055 --> 00:03:05,997
Two hundred
and the polaroids.

41
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:07,280
Please, motherfuckers.

42
00:03:07,351 --> 00:03:10,252
Please what, shit turd?

43
00:03:10,326 --> 00:03:13,359
Got a broke leg. Please,
get me out of here.

44
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:17,456
Wait a minute. You want me
to get wet on account of you?

45
00:03:17,525 --> 00:03:19,380
Think the world
owes you a living, huh?

46
00:03:19,445 --> 00:03:20,689
I'll drown.

47
00:03:20,756 --> 00:03:23,091
Hey, man, I got on
Swiss cotton underpants.

48
00:03:23,157 --> 00:03:25,742
Yeah, that's right.
Cost me $55 a pair.

49
00:03:25,812 --> 00:03:28,846
You think I wanna get all this
brown water and shit over them?

50
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,127
That don't come out.

51
00:03:30,197 --> 00:03:32,336
You got underwear on
that cost $55?

52
00:03:32,404 --> 00:03:34,444
My girl gave them to me.

53
00:03:38,548 --> 00:03:41,417
Come on, we get the time
of death from autopsy.

54
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:44,042
What are you doing?

55
00:03:44,115 --> 00:03:45,675
Hold this.

56
00:03:46,803 --> 00:03:48,265
Oh, come on, man.

57
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,056
Let the Fire Department get
him out. What are you, crazy?

58
00:03:51,123 --> 00:03:52,945
He ain't worth it!

59
00:03:53,011 --> 00:03:55,149
Come on, man.

60
00:03:55,218 --> 00:03:57,607
You are crazy.

61
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:03,528
You okay, man?
You okay?

62
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,516
The good news, Terence, is I'll
okay you to return to full duty.

63
00:04:09,585 --> 00:04:11,527
The bad news is
that in all likelyhood

64
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:15,660
you'll be experiencing
moderate to severe back pain.

65
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:17,223
How severe?

66
00:04:17,297 --> 00:04:19,566
You'll wanna be taking
something for it.

67
00:04:19,633 --> 00:04:23,407
Gonna write you a
prescription for Vicodin.

68
00:04:23,472 --> 00:04:24,902
For how long?

69
00:04:24,976 --> 00:04:26,121
From now on.

70
00:04:26,192 --> 00:04:29,007
No. For how long
am I gonna have pain?

71
00:04:29,072 --> 00:04:31,374
We're gonna try to manage
this as along as we can.

72
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,901
For the rest
of my life?

73
00:04:32,976 --> 00:04:36,359
Probably. But they're making
advancements every day, so,

74
00:04:36,432 --> 00:04:38,603
just work with me
on this, all right?

75
00:04:38,671 --> 00:04:42,054
Now, when this runs
out, call the office.

76
00:04:47,822 --> 00:04:51,369
Thank you for helping me
honor our fallen heroes today.

77
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:54,603
We will now move on to
the awards and promotions.

78
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:59,078
Among those being promoted
to lieutenant today,

79
00:04:59,151 --> 00:05:01,452
it gives me
great pleasure

80
00:05:01,518 --> 00:05:05,315
to additionally award the
Distinguish Service Cross

81
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:09,066
to Sergeant now Lieutenant
Terence McDonagh,

82
00:05:09,133 --> 00:05:13,355
in recognition of extreme
valor in the line of duty.

83
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:15,756
Congratulations, Lieutenant.

84
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,882
There's three more.

85
00:06:44,518 --> 00:06:47,900
You don't wanna look.
It's execution style.

86
00:06:59,366 --> 00:07:00,860
What did you
come up with?

87
00:07:00,934 --> 00:07:04,643
Scale in the closet, bundle
of glass in envelopes.

88
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:05,724
Dob been around?

89
00:07:05,797 --> 00:07:07,226
I thought he went away.

90
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:10,202
He's out. I saw him the other day.

91
00:07:10,277 --> 00:07:11,739
Let's get him in.

92
00:07:11,812 --> 00:07:14,561
His baby mama is over by
General Taylor and Annunciation.

93
00:07:14,628 --> 00:07:16,286
Uniforms doing the canvass?

94
00:07:16,356 --> 00:07:17,981
The duty captain
sent them out.

95
00:07:18,052 --> 00:07:21,697
Whoever they talk to, I want
followed up by a member of the squad.

96
00:07:21,764 --> 00:07:24,185
You'll see to that
personally, Armand.

97
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,820
Are they pulling
security cameras?

98
00:07:25,892 --> 00:07:26,939
Yeah.

99
00:07:27,011 --> 00:07:28,538
Every license plate
in the area.

100
00:07:28,612 --> 00:07:30,106
Got it.

101
00:07:51,842 --> 00:07:56,631
My Friend
by Babacar Ndele.

102
00:07:56,706 --> 00:07:58,877
"My friend is a fish.

103
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,538
"He live in my room.

104
00:08:00,609 --> 00:08:03,957
"His fin is a cloud.

105
00:08:04,033 --> 00:08:06,968
He see me
when I sleep. "

106
00:08:33,214 --> 00:08:37,971
Couple's name: Dauta
and Yasin Ndele.

107
00:08:38,046 --> 00:08:42,268
Dauta's mother's name:
Ramatullai Ndele.

108
00:08:42,334 --> 00:08:46,676
Children's names:
Animata and Babacar.

109
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,692
Family's from Senegal.

110
00:08:48,766 --> 00:08:51,187
Immigration status: illegal.

111
00:08:51,261 --> 00:08:52,985
From what we know,

112
00:08:53,053 --> 00:08:58,137
Dauta had been dealing heroin to
supplement his income as a peddler.

113
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,888
Now, I want
every drug dealer,

114
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,640
every junkie within
a five-mile radius

115
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:06,839
hassled into giving up
who his supplier was.

116
00:09:06,908 --> 00:09:08,599
Due to the nature
of this crime,

117
00:09:08,668 --> 00:09:11,417
you've got full authorization
for overtime if you need it.

118
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:14,386
Lieutenant McDonagh's gonna be
heading up the investigation,

119
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,183
so coordinate with him.

120
00:09:16,251 --> 00:09:18,869
That's it. Let's see some results.

121
00:09:18,939 --> 00:09:21,656
McDonagh, see you in
my office for a minute.

122
00:09:30,523 --> 00:09:31,865
You up to this?

123
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:33,905
Why wouldn't I be?

124
00:09:33,978 --> 00:09:36,466
I know you're still having
problems with your back.

125
00:09:36,538 --> 00:09:38,710
Dealing with being in
pain a lot of the time.

126
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:40,304
I'm managing.

127
00:09:40,378 --> 00:09:42,418
You still taking
medication for it?

128
00:09:43,546 --> 00:09:46,098
Only what
the doctor prescribes.

129
00:09:47,769 --> 00:09:50,190
Ordinarily there'd be somebody
with more time on the job

130
00:09:50,265 --> 00:09:52,119
handling this kind
of investigation.

131
00:09:52,185 --> 00:09:55,348
But I'm gonna go out on a limb with
you 'cause you got good instincts

132
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:57,686
and don't do nothing'
but work.

133
00:09:57,753 --> 00:10:00,916
But if I find that you needed
help and didn't ask for it,

134
00:10:00,985 --> 00:10:02,807
I will be mad.

135
00:10:02,872 --> 00:10:04,660
Yes, Sir.

136
00:10:04,728 --> 00:10:06,485
How is your
old man doing?

137
00:10:06,553 --> 00:10:10,447
He's drinking himself
into an early grave.

138
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,894
Give him my best,
would you?

139
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,170
I will.

140
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:17,429
Lieutenant, no more
unnecessary jumps, huh?

141
00:10:17,495 --> 00:10:19,350
Yes, Sir.

142
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:39,988
Good morning,
Mr. McDonagh.

143
00:10:56,564 --> 00:10:58,637
Hi, honey.

144
00:11:03,636 --> 00:11:05,491
You bring me something?

145
00:11:05,556 --> 00:11:06,766
You're out already?

146
00:11:06,836 --> 00:11:08,591
Yes.

147
00:11:20,626 --> 00:11:22,699
Mm.

148
00:11:31,826 --> 00:11:34,695
Frankie, hi. This is Andy.

149
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:40,071
Hey, hey, hey! Hoping to see
if you have any time tonight.

150
00:11:40,145 --> 00:11:43,757
I'm at the Monteleone.

151
00:11:43,825 --> 00:11:46,213
You need to call him back?

152
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,695
No.

153
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,022
You know I'd rather go
to the Monteleone with you.

154
00:11:51,088 --> 00:11:53,324
I can't afford it.

155
00:11:53,392 --> 00:11:56,556
I can.
I can afford it.

156
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:16,010
Yeah?

157
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,770
Who brought him in?

158
00:12:17,838 --> 00:12:19,780
That's who's
questioning him?

159
00:12:22,094 --> 00:12:24,515
I'll be there in ten minutes.
Tell him I'm on my way.

160
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:27,818
Tell him if he puts his hands on
this guy, he's gonna have a problem.

161
00:12:27,885 --> 00:12:31,847
I don't give a shit, Armand. You
tell him to take a fucking break!

162
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:35,746
Excuse me. Could you tell me
how much longer that's gonna be?

163
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:38,821
Hello, Miss? I'm a Lieutenant
in the Police Department.

164
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:41,227
I'm in the middle of
a homicide investigation.

165
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,496
Can I get my
prescription, please?

166
00:12:43,564 --> 00:12:46,215
Do you see
I'm on the phone?

167
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,256
Hey, you can't
come back here.

168
00:12:49,324 --> 00:12:52,739
You got me waiting 40 minutes so you
can make a fucking personal phone call!

169
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:58,472
Security. Security to Pharmacy.
Security to Pharmacy, please.

170
00:12:58,539 --> 00:13:01,441
This is it. This is
it. Police emergency.

171
00:13:01,515 --> 00:13:02,857
You're no cop.

172
00:13:02,924 --> 00:13:04,036
What's that look like?

173
00:13:04,107 --> 00:13:06,976
Why are you acting
all crazy for?

174
00:13:07,051 --> 00:13:09,768
This is, uh, $23
with my copay, right?

175
00:13:09,835 --> 00:13:12,104
There's 40. Give
everybody a drink.

176
00:13:12,171 --> 00:13:14,243
Get the fuck
out of my way.

177
00:13:16,234 --> 00:13:18,722
Dob, look at me.

178
00:13:18,794 --> 00:13:20,703
Okay?

179
00:13:20,778 --> 00:13:22,665
Two hours.
That's enough.

180
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:25,632
Tell me something
I don't know.

181
00:13:25,706 --> 00:13:27,332
Man, you gotta
get me outta here.

182
00:13:27,401 --> 00:13:28,895
Get you outta here?
Are you crazy?

183
00:13:28,969 --> 00:13:31,456
I got you on possession.
You're on parole.

184
00:13:31,528 --> 00:13:33,733
Maybe but one
skinny ass joint.

185
00:13:33,801 --> 00:13:35,939
That joint's gonna
get you back.

186
00:13:36,009 --> 00:13:38,213
I've got five
dead people, man.

187
00:13:38,281 --> 00:13:39,360
You understand?

188
00:13:39,432 --> 00:13:40,959
I don't know
nothin' about it.

189
00:13:41,032 --> 00:13:42,821
Tell me something.

190
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:44,775
What do you
want me to tell you?

191
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,069
I want you to tell me something I haven't
heard. I don't want you to tell me,

192
00:13:48,137 --> 00:13:51,103
look at me, I don't want you to
tell me that you don't know nothing.

193
00:13:51,176 --> 00:13:53,631
But I don't know nothing.

194
00:13:53,704 --> 00:13:55,492
Did you tell him
what I said?

195
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:57,153
You understand
what that means?

196
00:13:57,224 --> 00:14:00,867
I'm entitled to whatever
I want in this room.

197
00:14:00,934 --> 00:14:04,066
That means Guantanamo Bay.
You believe this motherfucker?

198
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:07,647
I've busted my ass for yambos
and this yambo won't tell me shit.

199
00:14:07,718 --> 00:14:10,107
Detective, can I see you
outside for a second?

200
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:13,498
Uh, yeah, sure.
Two minutes.

201
00:14:13,574 --> 00:14:15,231
Think about it.

202
00:14:16,613 --> 00:14:18,337
Uh, not a great time
to take a break.

203
00:14:18,406 --> 00:14:19,354
What are you doing?

204
00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:20,607
He's about to go.

205
00:14:20,678 --> 00:14:22,238
Bullshit. He's scared out of his mind.

206
00:14:22,309 --> 00:14:24,894
You and your partner made a
spectacle out of picking him up.

207
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:27,812
Everyone in Central City knows
he's in here. No, just shush.

208
00:14:27,876 --> 00:14:30,528
You think he's gonna go out if
you keep insulting him like that?

209
00:14:30,597 --> 00:14:32,701
You trying to tell me
how to do my interrogation?

210
00:14:32,773 --> 00:14:35,489
Yes. I'm gonna tell you when
you're doing something wrong.

211
00:14:35,556 --> 00:14:37,564
Go fuck yourself.

212
00:14:38,116 --> 00:14:40,025
I'm gonna treat
you respectfully.

213
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,525
You treat me respectfully.

214
00:14:42,596 --> 00:14:45,596
I'm looking at some bullshit pot
busting. Because you're on parole

215
00:14:45,668 --> 00:14:48,056
you wind up back in Angola.
Why would you do that?

216
00:14:48,131 --> 00:14:50,171
I ain't the one
doing it.

217
00:14:50,243 --> 00:14:52,282
Who did this African
guy piss off?

218
00:14:52,355 --> 00:14:55,225
I never said two words
to him. I don't know.

219
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:57,950
But you knew he was
selling dope. Come on.

220
00:14:59,939 --> 00:15:04,314
Shall I call your parole officer?
He'll violate you, stop wasting my time.

221
00:15:04,386 --> 00:15:06,142
I knew he was selling.

222
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:10,268
Okay. Tell me where he was
selling, whose neighborhood was it.

223
00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:13,720
Man, look. I got me a good
job at a cleaning service.

224
00:15:13,793 --> 00:15:15,932
I check in when
I'm supposed to.

225
00:15:16,002 --> 00:15:18,238
I smoke a little
weed, but that's it.

226
00:15:18,306 --> 00:15:21,469
Tell me whose
neighborhood it was, Dob.

227
00:15:26,945 --> 00:15:28,154
Man.

228
00:15:31,456 --> 00:15:33,464
You know Fate?

229
00:15:33,537 --> 00:15:36,188
Big Fate? Yeah.

230
00:15:36,256 --> 00:15:41,438
Ain't nothin' moved that part of
town. He ain't got a piece of it.

231
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:44,601
Where can I find him?

232
00:15:44,671 --> 00:15:47,224
Shit. I'm saying
all I am gonna say.

233
00:15:47,295 --> 00:15:50,873
If you want me to lead you to
him, you well just lock me up.

234
00:16:00,862 --> 00:16:02,837
Check Stevie's arrest
report on Dob.

235
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:05,757
If it mentions marijuana,
make sure it gets lost.

236
00:16:05,822 --> 00:16:07,479
What do I tell Stevie?

237
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,240
You can tell him
to go fuck himself.

238
00:16:09,309 --> 00:16:12,309
I'm gonna go upstairs and
crash an hour in the crib.

239
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:38,230
What do you want, Mundt?

240
00:16:42,715 --> 00:16:46,010
Internal Affairs is checking
the property room vouchers.

241
00:16:46,075 --> 00:16:47,482
So?

242
00:16:47,547 --> 00:16:50,035
That means they're gonna
find out the shit missing.

243
00:16:50,107 --> 00:16:52,016
Not if you don't
tell them, they won't.

244
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:56,178
I can't do it
anymore, Terence.

245
00:16:59,482 --> 00:17:01,620
Oh, fuck.

246
00:17:06,713 --> 00:17:09,168
I'm-I'm really sorry.
I just can't.

247
00:17:09,241 --> 00:17:11,477
Mundt,

248
00:17:11,545 --> 00:17:14,579
whatever drugs might've been
taken out of the property room,

249
00:17:15,865 --> 00:17:18,646
you will have a
voucher, you understand?

250
00:17:18,713 --> 00:17:23,022
They won't turn up as missing, 'cause
there's no record of them being there

251
00:17:23,096 --> 00:17:26,391
in the first
place, okay?

252
00:17:26,456 --> 00:17:28,724
They're installing cameras.

253
00:17:30,103 --> 00:17:33,486
So then you
don't do anything

254
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,750
where the cameras
can see you.

255
00:17:37,815 --> 00:17:39,441
I can't.

256
00:17:39,511 --> 00:17:42,577
When it was me re-doing paperwork
to cover the cash you misplaced,

257
00:17:42,647 --> 00:17:45,494
that was all right. That was
entirely fucking reasonable.

258
00:17:45,558 --> 00:17:47,380
I'm sorry.

259
00:17:48,823 --> 00:17:50,383
Hey, Mundt.

260
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,778
Hey, Mundt?

261
00:18:33,203 --> 00:18:35,275
You bad boy.

262
00:18:41,042 --> 00:18:43,530
Oh, yeah.

263
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:48,361
Stand against the wall.

264
00:18:48,435 --> 00:18:51,533
Come on! Stand
against the wall.

265
00:18:51,602 --> 00:18:53,456
You're too busy making
out with your girlfriend

266
00:18:53,522 --> 00:18:55,376
you don't know when you've
done something illegal?

267
00:18:55,441 --> 00:18:56,870
What are we
high on tonight?

268
00:18:56,945 --> 00:18:57,960
Nothing.

269
00:18:58,033 --> 00:18:59,855
You passed drugs
in that club?

270
00:18:59,922 --> 00:19:01,645
No.

271
00:19:01,713 --> 00:19:05,389
The two of you match a description. Empty
your pockets and dump out the handbag.

272
00:19:05,457 --> 00:19:06,634
Why?

273
00:19:06,704 --> 00:19:08,592
I said you match
a description.

274
00:19:08,657 --> 00:19:10,991
Somebody seen
passing drugs.

275
00:19:11,056 --> 00:19:13,577
I wasn't passing drugs.
What does that even mean?

276
00:19:13,649 --> 00:19:17,063
Empty your pockets. Dump out the
handbag. I'm not gonna tell you again.

277
00:19:17,136 --> 00:19:19,405
This is bullshit!

278
00:19:19,472 --> 00:19:21,807
Just do what
he says, okay?

279
00:19:21,872 --> 00:19:23,464
What you got in there?

280
00:19:23,535 --> 00:19:25,128
Nothing.

281
00:19:25,199 --> 00:19:27,206
I'm not gonna
get stuck, am I?

282
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:28,588
No.

283
00:19:28,656 --> 00:19:30,793
I get stuck, I'm gonna
be very fucking angry.

284
00:19:30,863 --> 00:19:32,838
You're not
gonna get stuck.

285
00:19:32,911 --> 00:19:36,010
Where's your badge
if you're a cop?

286
00:19:38,255 --> 00:19:40,905
Here's what
I'm looking for.

287
00:19:40,974 --> 00:19:43,974
Here's where it
says I'm a cop.

288
00:19:44,046 --> 00:19:48,301
Sir, it-it's obviously
just for personal use.

289
00:19:48,366 --> 00:19:49,543
I mean,
I'm not a dealer.

290
00:19:49,613 --> 00:19:52,134
That's for
the DA to decide.

291
00:19:52,206 --> 00:19:55,205
You're gonna dump that
bag or I gotta do it?

292
00:19:57,581 --> 00:20:01,607
Sir, is-is there any way my parents
don't have to find out about this?

293
00:20:01,676 --> 00:20:04,098
I mean, can we, can we just handle this?

294
00:20:04,172 --> 00:20:07,238
I'll go to jail on weekends or
something like that if I have to do that.

295
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:10,537
My father has a
heart condition, okay?

296
00:20:12,139 --> 00:20:15,816
This would kill him. Please.
Just let me keep this from him.

297
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:18,054
You think he want
might to know?

298
00:20:18,123 --> 00:20:22,433
Yeah. I'd wanna know
if you were my child.

299
00:20:26,026 --> 00:20:28,263
Here.

300
00:20:28,331 --> 00:20:32,259
This fur is nothing, but
this was my grandmother's.

301
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:35,843
It's worth $60,000.

302
00:20:35,915 --> 00:20:38,435
You can give it
to your girlfriend.

303
00:20:38,506 --> 00:20:40,262
If you don't have
a girlfriend,

304
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:42,218
you can give it
to your mother.

305
00:20:42,281 --> 00:20:43,808
It's attempted bribery.

306
00:20:43,882 --> 00:20:45,126
Excuse me!

307
00:20:45,194 --> 00:20:48,259
This is worth $60,000.

308
00:20:48,329 --> 00:20:51,591
Doesn't that get
us pass attempted?

309
00:20:51,657 --> 00:20:53,828
Where's the rock at?

310
00:20:53,897 --> 00:20:56,614
Come on, come on,
who's got the kibble?

311
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,548
You wanna hit?

312
00:20:59,624 --> 00:21:01,086
Yes.

313
00:21:16,871 --> 00:21:19,904
Jesus Christ.

314
00:21:19,974 --> 00:21:21,403
Again.

315
00:21:21,479 --> 00:21:23,267
Yeah?

316
00:21:28,903 --> 00:21:31,390
Are you fucking
kidding me?

317
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:51,619
This what's gonna take? Yeah?

318
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,074
You're worried about
your father finding out?

319
00:21:54,148 --> 00:21:55,327
No.

320
00:21:55,396 --> 00:21:56,639
What about your mother?

321
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:58,977
I don't give a shit
about either one of them.

322
00:21:59,044 --> 00:22:00,637
Did they beat you?

323
00:22:00,708 --> 00:22:02,115
No.

324
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,773
Molest you?

325
00:22:03,844 --> 00:22:05,469
No.

326
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:08,257
Didn't buy you new clothes
at back to school, huh?

327
00:22:08,323 --> 00:22:12,251
Didn't see you in the
high school play, huh?

328
00:22:12,323 --> 00:22:15,290
I wonder what'd they
say if they saw you now.

329
00:22:15,363 --> 00:22:17,751
Smokin' crack.

330
00:22:17,826 --> 00:22:20,161
Going out with
no panties on?

331
00:22:20,227 --> 00:22:21,787
No panties?

332
00:22:24,706 --> 00:22:28,535
I bet they think about you
when you were a little girl.

333
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:30,781
Wonder what the hell
happened to ya?

334
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:36,698
Don't fucking move!
You stand there and watch!

335
00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:41,024
You watch her! Watch
your fucking girlfriend.

336
00:22:54,016 --> 00:22:55,804
Fuck!

337
00:23:34,717 --> 00:23:36,440
I need the coke back.

338
00:23:36,509 --> 00:23:38,070
What happened?

339
00:23:38,142 --> 00:23:41,011
I snorted what I thought was
coke. It turned out to be heroin.

340
00:23:41,084 --> 00:23:42,458
I gotta be at
work in a hour.

341
00:23:42,525 --> 00:23:44,629
Oh, baby, okay.
I'm not alone.

342
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,515
Just get the coke.
I'll get out of here.

343
00:23:59,196 --> 00:24:01,399
You didn't break it
out for your client?

344
00:24:01,467 --> 00:24:03,290
Nah. He brings his own.

345
00:24:03,356 --> 00:24:04,600
Uh-huh.

346
00:24:07,899 --> 00:24:09,655
Who are you?

347
00:24:14,938 --> 00:24:18,647
I'm the last person in the
world you want me to be.

348
00:24:18,714 --> 00:24:20,689
He's just
an old friend.

349
00:24:20,762 --> 00:24:25,017
Come on, missy, we've had you
under surveillance for weeks.

350
00:24:25,082 --> 00:24:27,635
Do you have any illegal
substances on you?

351
00:24:27,706 --> 00:24:29,232
Like what?

352
00:24:29,305 --> 00:24:30,963
Asshole.

353
00:24:31,033 --> 00:24:34,383
Cooperate with me, I'll
let you walk outta here.

354
00:24:34,457 --> 00:24:38,101
You play games,
come with her.

355
00:24:40,665 --> 00:24:42,671
I got some coke.

356
00:24:42,744 --> 00:24:44,719
Get it.

357
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:54,384
Get out.

358
00:25:08,214 --> 00:25:10,037
That was fun.

359
00:25:10,102 --> 00:25:12,141
Hey.

360
00:25:47,284 --> 00:25:49,423
Come. Come!

361
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,169
Are you a policeman?

362
00:25:52,243 --> 00:25:53,257
Yes.

363
00:25:53,332 --> 00:25:54,607
Do you know
who do this?

364
00:25:54,675 --> 00:25:55,722
I don't know, yet.

365
00:25:55,795 --> 00:25:57,038
Look here.

366
00:25:57,107 --> 00:25:59,211
This dead.
Babacar.

367
00:25:59,282 --> 00:26:01,672
This little girl,
no more.

368
00:26:01,747 --> 00:26:04,135
He's dead, dead.
Older man.

369
00:26:04,211 --> 00:26:07,473
Oh, my angel, she's
dead. All my whole family.

370
00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:09,099
How are you related?

371
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,919
Yasin. She were
my sister.

372
00:26:11,986 --> 00:26:13,611
When was the last
time you saw her?

373
00:26:13,682 --> 00:26:17,129
I see her dat morning. I go
by in case she need anything.

374
00:26:17,202 --> 00:26:20,517
But dat morning she says she
needs something from the grocery,

375
00:26:20,593 --> 00:26:24,870
and she called there and had it
delivered by a boy to her home.

376
00:26:24,945 --> 00:26:26,635
Help me, please.

377
00:26:26,705 --> 00:26:29,933
Please, help me find
the killer of my family.

378
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,645
Please, sir.
Help me. Help.

379
00:26:53,551 --> 00:26:54,761
Are you the manager?

380
00:26:54,831 --> 00:26:55,758
No, sir.

381
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,830
The manager's
over there.

382
00:27:00,975 --> 00:27:03,974
New Orleans Homicide. You got
people making deliveries here?

383
00:27:04,046 --> 00:27:07,461
We get different guys making deliveries.
Different days, different guys.

384
00:27:07,533 --> 00:27:09,257
What about Tuesday?

385
00:27:09,326 --> 00:27:11,235
Different times a day.
Different guys.

386
00:27:11,309 --> 00:27:12,585
Late afternoon.

387
00:27:12,654 --> 00:27:15,686
We don't keep track of
who takes what to who.

388
00:27:15,757 --> 00:27:18,178
Is there a delivery boy who
hasn't shown up in a while?

389
00:27:43,723 --> 00:27:45,894
Excuse us. Hello!

390
00:27:45,963 --> 00:27:47,938
Police Department.

391
00:27:48,011 --> 00:27:49,953
We're looking
for Binnie Rogers.

392
00:27:50,027 --> 00:27:51,717
I'm Binnie Rogers.

393
00:27:51,787 --> 00:27:55,299
We need to talk to you for a second.
Do you mind stepping in the hall?

394
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:58,152
No, I can't step
into the hall.

395
00:27:58,219 --> 00:28:00,935
Can't you see this
lady needs me here?

396
00:28:02,858 --> 00:28:05,639
We're looking for your
grandson, Miss Rogers.

397
00:28:05,706 --> 00:28:07,331
What are you
looking for him for?

398
00:28:07,401 --> 00:28:09,441
Just to talk. We just wanna talk to him.

399
00:28:09,513 --> 00:28:11,585
He do somethin' wrong?

400
00:28:11,658 --> 00:28:13,729
He might've been
a witness to a crime.

401
00:28:13,801 --> 00:28:15,492
I don't know
anything about that.

402
00:28:15,561 --> 00:28:17,284
Where can we find him?

403
00:28:17,352 --> 00:28:22,055
Young man, what do you think gives
you the right to come into my room

404
00:28:22,121 --> 00:28:27,107
and have a conversation without
even acknowledging my presence?

405
00:28:27,177 --> 00:28:29,380
We're terribly sorry.

406
00:28:29,448 --> 00:28:32,993
It's very important we talk
to this woman's grandson.

407
00:28:33,063 --> 00:28:35,268
And she told you she
doesn't know where he is.

408
00:28:35,336 --> 00:28:37,921
Actually, she hasn't
told us that.

409
00:28:37,992 --> 00:28:40,096
I don't know.

410
00:28:43,206 --> 00:28:44,700
I'm sorry, Grandma.

411
00:28:49,606 --> 00:28:52,389
What do you
wanna know?

412
00:28:52,454 --> 00:28:56,763
Did you make a delivery Tuesday
on Josephine and Danneel, son?

413
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:00,446
Uh-huh.

414
00:29:00,518 --> 00:29:01,827
What did you see there?

415
00:29:01,894 --> 00:29:04,130
This is a 15-year
old boy, sir.

416
00:29:04,197 --> 00:29:06,270
We need you to tell us
what you saw, Daryl.

417
00:29:06,342 --> 00:29:09,724
He don't get involved
in drugs, in gangs.

418
00:29:09,797 --> 00:29:11,935
He go to school.

419
00:29:12,005 --> 00:29:14,306
He hold down a job
and he come home.

420
00:29:14,373 --> 00:29:16,282
A family was
murdered, ma'am.

421
00:29:16,356 --> 00:29:18,527
And I feel very
bad about that.

422
00:29:18,596 --> 00:29:21,858
But I don't want my
grandson involved in it.

423
00:29:21,924 --> 00:29:25,185
Maybe your grandson has
some feelings of his own.

424
00:29:31,363 --> 00:29:32,824
Well,

425
00:29:34,403 --> 00:29:38,658
the lady told me to set the
grocery bags in the kitchen.

426
00:29:38,724 --> 00:29:42,552
Uh, as I was setting the grocery
bags down, I heard screaming.

427
00:29:42,626 --> 00:29:44,568
And I heard gunshots.

428
00:29:44,642 --> 00:29:47,162
So I hid in the closet.

429
00:29:51,107 --> 00:29:53,757
When I came out,
everybody was dead.

430
00:29:55,457 --> 00:29:57,846
Did you see
who shot them?

431
00:30:07,169 --> 00:30:09,471
That a yes or a no?

432
00:30:17,473 --> 00:30:20,603
This is who we're looking
for. Name is Donald Godshaw.

433
00:30:20,671 --> 00:30:24,217
Street name "Big Fate. " You should
familiarize yourself with his record.

434
00:30:24,288 --> 00:30:27,254
It goes back to '91. Did
time for rape, sodomy,

435
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:30,775
aggravated assault, narcotics, and
possession of automatic weapons.

436
00:30:30,847 --> 00:30:35,768
We believe he's also behind at least
three homicides including the Ndele family.

437
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:38,260
Lieutenant, wanna show
some of those victims?

438
00:30:39,551 --> 00:30:42,649
All three were
possible witnesses.

439
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,365
Godshaw has two flunkies
that he runs with.

440
00:30:46,431 --> 00:30:48,340
Deshaun Hackett,
street name "Midget. "

441
00:30:48,414 --> 00:30:52,276
Has a girlfriend on Burgundy and Mazant.
We'll set up surveillance on the block.

442
00:30:52,349 --> 00:30:54,683
Maybe we'll get
lucky he'll turn up.

443
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:58,546
Gary Jenkins,
street name "G."

444
00:30:58,621 --> 00:31:01,141
His grandmother lives
in the Iberville Projects.

445
00:31:01,213 --> 00:31:04,890
If his laying low chances are,
that's where we'll find him.

446
00:31:04,957 --> 00:31:06,484
Let's bring him in.

447
00:31:26,811 --> 00:31:28,469
Give me a minute.

448
00:31:37,403 --> 00:31:40,152
I need access to the apartment
next door. Do you mind?

449
00:31:40,218 --> 00:31:43,153
Oh! It's okay, baby.

450
00:31:43,226 --> 00:31:44,752
Why you need
access for?

451
00:31:44,826 --> 00:31:48,688
We had complaints about
disturbance, not answering the door.

452
00:33:08,468 --> 00:33:10,769
Don't fucking breathe.

453
00:33:32,242 --> 00:33:34,151
I love it.

454
00:33:34,225 --> 00:33:36,135
I just love it.

455
00:33:42,257 --> 00:33:44,809
I've told you
everything I know.

456
00:33:46,481 --> 00:33:48,336
This is your
lucky day, son.

457
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:52,230
You're the first person we've picked up.
You're in a position to help yourself.

458
00:33:52,304 --> 00:33:53,798
Help myself do what?

459
00:33:53,872 --> 00:33:56,174
You know something about
this family that got murdered.

460
00:33:56,241 --> 00:33:58,215
I don't know nothing.

461
00:33:58,288 --> 00:34:02,062
You were in the apartment when the Africans
got shot. Who was with you? Midget Donald?

462
00:34:02,128 --> 00:34:05,389
Donald Godshaw, "Big Fate. "
Where is he? Where can we find him?

463
00:34:05,456 --> 00:34:06,450
I don't know
no "Big Fate. "

464
00:34:06,524 --> 00:34:07,651
We find them on our own
we don't need you no more.

465
00:34:07,652 --> 00:34:09,478
There's gonna be five
homicides to answer for

466
00:34:09,551 --> 00:34:11,045
and Donald's gonna
hang them on you.

467
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,869
He gets eight to ten.
You get natural life.

468
00:34:13,935 --> 00:34:16,040
I don't know nobody
named "Midget".

469
00:34:16,111 --> 00:34:18,761
I don't know nobody
named "Big Fate. "

470
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:30,829
Renaldo Hayes!

471
00:34:30,894 --> 00:34:33,928
Oh. Man!
That's bad luck.

472
00:34:33,997 --> 00:34:37,859
I keep hoping once in a while this
kid throws to somebody on his own team.

473
00:34:37,933 --> 00:34:41,161
I love the guy. By the end of the
fucking game, I'm starting to hate him.

474
00:34:41,229 --> 00:34:42,636
What do you want
for the weekend?

475
00:34:42,701 --> 00:34:44,489
What's the spread on
Louisiana-Arkansas?

476
00:34:44,557 --> 00:34:45,734
Four.

477
00:34:45,805 --> 00:34:47,528
Louisiana.

478
00:34:47,596 --> 00:34:49,931
Minus to four
for a dime.

479
00:34:49,997 --> 00:34:52,647
You got it. I got
a favor to ask.

480
00:34:52,717 --> 00:34:54,473
My kid got
a speeding ticket.

481
00:34:54,541 --> 00:34:56,995
I'll get it taken care of
if you give me half a point.

482
00:34:57,068 --> 00:34:59,490
You're gonna grind me
for helping out my kid?

483
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:01,571
Grind you? You're funny
guy, you know that?

484
00:35:01,644 --> 00:35:05,189
There's guys getting half a point
on the street for nothing. Grind you.

485
00:35:08,043 --> 00:35:11,076
All right. But you take care of it.

486
00:35:38,281 --> 00:35:40,103
Hello. Hello!

487
00:35:40,169 --> 00:35:42,853
I'm Lieutenant McDonagh,
New Orleans Homicide.

488
00:35:42,921 --> 00:35:44,350
What can I do for you?

489
00:35:44,425 --> 00:35:46,758
A friend of mine's daughter
got written up for speeding.

490
00:35:46,824 --> 00:35:49,791
She was doing 75 on the way to the
hospital to visit her grandmother.

491
00:35:49,864 --> 00:35:52,679
Has a couple of minor,
minor violations in the past.

492
00:35:52,744 --> 00:35:54,467
She's in danger
of losing her license.

493
00:35:54,535 --> 00:35:55,844
What do you
want me to do?

494
00:35:55,912 --> 00:35:57,439
I'd like you to take
care of it for me.

495
00:35:57,511 --> 00:35:59,900
You come out to the scene of
an accident to ask me that?

496
00:35:59,975 --> 00:36:01,633
There shouldn't
be a problem.

497
00:36:01,703 --> 00:36:05,631
Are you asking me to break the
law? Is that what you're doing here?

498
00:36:05,703 --> 00:36:09,728
I'm asking you one cop to
another to do me a favor.

499
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:12,867
The answer's no.

500
00:36:12,935 --> 00:36:14,527
Just like that?

501
00:36:14,598 --> 00:36:16,027
Just like that.

502
00:36:16,102 --> 00:36:19,450
Is this the same Police
Department my father was in?

503
00:36:19,526 --> 00:36:20,802
You'll excuse me.

504
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:22,212
Great.

505
00:36:22,278 --> 00:36:25,408
Guardian of the Flame,
right? Fucking ass.

506
00:36:25,477 --> 00:36:27,649
Get back in you
car, Lieutenant.

507
00:36:28,965 --> 00:36:30,143
Or else what?

508
00:36:30,213 --> 00:36:32,482
Hey there.

509
00:36:32,549 --> 00:36:34,076
Hey, what are
you doing here?

510
00:36:34,149 --> 00:36:35,577
You know the Lieutenant?

511
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:37,441
Yeah. We used
to work together.

512
00:36:37,509 --> 00:36:40,127
Why don't you walk him
back to his car?

513
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,748
I could've told you not to
bother with that asshole.

514
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:49,121
You needed a ticket fixed,
why didn't you come to me?

515
00:36:49,188 --> 00:36:50,714
I didn't know
you worked here.

516
00:36:50,788 --> 00:36:53,504
They only let me out on patrol
when they're short handed.

517
00:36:53,572 --> 00:36:55,906
Mostly they got me
in the property room.

518
00:36:55,971 --> 00:36:58,011
Property room?

519
00:36:58,083 --> 00:36:59,992
What are you
doing tonight?

520
00:37:02,115 --> 00:37:03,457
You asking me out?

521
00:37:03,523 --> 00:37:05,345
Yes, I am.

522
00:38:01,534 --> 00:38:03,541
Hey.

523
00:38:06,494 --> 00:38:09,810
You like these
boots, don't you?

524
00:38:09,886 --> 00:38:12,602
You got some body on
you, you know that.

525
00:38:12,669 --> 00:38:14,557
Yeah?

526
00:38:14,621 --> 00:38:16,082
You horny?

527
00:38:16,157 --> 00:38:19,419
Oh, yeah.

528
00:38:19,485 --> 00:38:23,827
No, you're not.
You're high on dope.

529
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:26,999
Not true.

530
00:38:27,069 --> 00:38:30,135
Whatever I take
is prescription.

531
00:38:30,205 --> 00:38:33,500
Except for the heroin.

532
00:38:34,877 --> 00:38:37,331
Hey! Wake up, McDonagh.

533
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:43,921
Yeah, there's times I can't get
what I need with the prescription.

534
00:38:43,995 --> 00:38:45,783
Really?

535
00:38:45,851 --> 00:38:50,041
Yeah. When my back
hurts sometimes.

536
00:38:50,107 --> 00:38:55,125
Well, maybe there's something I
can do to make that pain go away.

537
00:38:55,194 --> 00:38:57,561
You definitely can.

538
00:38:57,626 --> 00:39:00,212
What's that, baby? What do
you want me to do for you?

539
00:39:00,283 --> 00:39:02,803
Check out your
property room

540
00:39:02,874 --> 00:39:06,037
and see if there's
any Oxycontin

541
00:39:06,105 --> 00:39:08,276
or morphine

542
00:39:08,345 --> 00:39:12,404
you can sneak
outta there.

543
00:39:12,473 --> 00:39:16,401
Just make sure you get
rid of the voucher copy.

544
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:21,173
You're nuts.

545
00:39:37,431 --> 00:39:40,147
Hey.

546
00:39:40,215 --> 00:39:43,281
The ticket's gonna be a little
more complicated than I thought.

547
00:39:43,351 --> 00:39:45,652
You're kidding me.

548
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:48,402
The best thing to do is to
have her plead not guilty.

549
00:39:48,471 --> 00:39:52,268
By the time a court day comes around,
I'll talk to the cop who wrote her up.

550
00:39:52,343 --> 00:39:54,382
I thought that's what
you were gonna do.

551
00:39:54,454 --> 00:39:57,389
I went straight
to the Lieutenant.

552
00:39:57,462 --> 00:40:00,331
He wound up being
a hard on.

553
00:40:00,406 --> 00:40:03,341
It'll work out. It's just gonna
take a little longer. Come on.

554
00:40:03,414 --> 00:40:04,997
Kinda calls into question the

555
00:40:04,998 --> 00:40:08,781
half-a-point-for-nothing
concept, don't you think?

556
00:40:08,853 --> 00:40:10,762
You're some cheap
prick, you know that?

557
00:40:10,837 --> 00:40:13,521
You say you're gonna do
something and you don't do it.

558
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:15,793
Good! Charge me
for the half point.

559
00:40:15,861 --> 00:40:20,912
And after last weekend,
you're down $3,000.

560
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:24,492
You might,
I mean, might

561
00:40:24,563 --> 00:40:27,858
have thought to bring me
a little something.

562
00:40:29,363 --> 00:40:31,273
Two dimes!

563
00:40:31,347 --> 00:40:33,420
On Louisiana

564
00:40:33,492 --> 00:40:35,631
against Georgia.

565
00:40:38,451 --> 00:40:41,004
Okay, you got it.

566
00:41:22,128 --> 00:41:23,305
How long has he
been in there?

567
00:41:23,376 --> 00:41:24,521
About 20 minutes.

568
00:41:24,591 --> 00:41:26,053
Who else?

569
00:41:26,128 --> 00:41:28,844
His girlfriend. At least
one. That's as far as we know.

570
00:41:28,912 --> 00:41:32,108
What are these fucking iguanas
doing on my coffee table?

571
00:41:32,175 --> 00:41:34,182
There ain't no iguana.

572
00:41:34,255 --> 00:41:35,564
Yeah, there are.

573
00:41:35,631 --> 00:41:38,184
There ain't no iguana.

574
00:41:38,255 --> 00:41:40,491
What the fuck is that?
Fucking iguana.

575
00:41:42,607 --> 00:41:43,752
Are we set up?

576
00:41:43,823 --> 00:41:45,164
SWAT's around
the corner.

577
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:48,230
No! No, just, just no
SWAT. Let them stay there.

578
00:41:48,302 --> 00:41:51,302
The duty captain said he wanted
to coordinate with us when we-

579
00:41:51,373 --> 00:41:54,952
Is that what you're fucking doing now?
Reporting back to the duty captain?

580
00:41:55,022 --> 00:41:56,810
I'm telling you
what he said.

581
00:41:57,966 --> 00:42:00,682
If we need SWAT,
we'll call 'em.

582
00:43:06,312 --> 00:43:07,425
Let's go.

583
00:43:28,519 --> 00:43:29,566
Who else is in here?

584
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:31,012
Nobody.

585
00:43:31,078 --> 00:43:33,599
We're gonna come back
every day, you understand?

586
00:43:33,670 --> 00:43:38,853
More times we come back, more
chances that child getting shot.

587
00:43:38,919 --> 00:43:40,642
Ain't nobody here.

588
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:43,164
He's hiding back
there in the armoire.

589
00:43:50,438 --> 00:43:53,023
You all stay
with her. Armand.

590
00:44:08,484 --> 00:44:09,793
Get up.

591
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,615
I said get up!

592
00:44:11,683 --> 00:44:13,374
Damn, man.

593
00:44:13,443 --> 00:44:17,185
It's always nice to see
an intact family.

594
00:44:17,251 --> 00:44:19,641
A father who honors
his obligations

595
00:44:19,715 --> 00:44:22,398
as far as his
children are a concern.

596
00:44:22,467 --> 00:44:25,020
You're here.
That's important thing.

597
00:44:25,091 --> 00:44:28,539
You may be hiding in an armoire,
but your child knows you're here.

598
00:44:28,611 --> 00:44:29,887
Are you tripping, man?

599
00:44:29,954 --> 00:44:31,231
Armand, give us
a minute.

600
00:44:31,298 --> 00:44:33,054
You're tripping.
You on that shit.

601
00:44:33,122 --> 00:44:36,122
Shut the door. Shut up. Shut the door.

602
00:44:37,698 --> 00:44:39,159
Sit down.

603
00:44:40,034 --> 00:44:41,822
Sit down, sit down.

604
00:44:45,473 --> 00:44:47,382
Now we can talk.

605
00:44:49,504 --> 00:44:51,926
You don't mind if I
light one up, do you?

606
00:44:52,001 --> 00:44:53,910
Fuck, man.

607
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,261
I find it relaxes me.

608
00:44:59,297 --> 00:45:01,020
What the fuck, man?

609
00:45:01,088 --> 00:45:05,081
You know we got your boy, "G." Right?

610
00:45:05,152 --> 00:45:07,388
Man, I don't know no "G."

611
00:45:08,768 --> 00:45:10,590
He knows you.

612
00:45:12,736 --> 00:45:14,524
It's amazing how much
you can get done

613
00:45:14,591 --> 00:45:17,820
when you've got a simple
purpose guiding through life.

614
00:45:23,295 --> 00:45:25,597
My purpose is
to find out

615
00:45:25,662 --> 00:45:28,248
who shot up this
apartment on Josephine.

616
00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:31,253
I know the guy who was
living there was from Senegal.

617
00:45:31,327 --> 00:45:33,213
I know he was
selling heroin.

618
00:45:33,278 --> 00:45:36,409
I know whose territory
he was stepping on.

619
00:45:36,478 --> 00:45:39,544
And I know who went over to the
apartment to straighten him out.

620
00:45:39,613 --> 00:45:43,290
I found out all that
in the past few days.

621
00:45:45,373 --> 00:45:47,894
Where is
"Big Fate," son?

622
00:45:47,964 --> 00:45:50,452
I don't know
no "Big Fate. "

623
00:45:50,525 --> 00:45:52,435
You see, I know
that's not true.

624
00:45:52,508 --> 00:45:55,955
'Cause everybody who comes from where
you come, knows who "Big Fate" is.

625
00:45:56,028 --> 00:45:59,028
The fact that you're lying to me,
tells me you're hiding something.

626
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:02,809
You know my only reason for being here
is to find out who shot up the apartment.

627
00:46:02,875 --> 00:46:05,722
I know that's what you're
hiding. See? It all,

628
00:46:05,788 --> 00:46:10,065
all comes back to that
same simple purpose.

629
00:46:10,138 --> 00:46:14,416
Man, I ain't
telling you shit.

630
00:46:34,681 --> 00:46:36,623
Hey.

631
00:46:36,698 --> 00:46:38,486
What's wrong?

632
00:46:38,553 --> 00:46:41,553
Your father's mad at me 'cause I
can't take care of his fucking dog.

633
00:46:41,625 --> 00:46:43,316
Why does he need you
to take care of it?

634
00:46:43,384 --> 00:46:46,101
'Cause he's going
back into AA.

635
00:46:46,168 --> 00:46:49,648
He says he can't do with
any more responsibilities.

636
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:53,015
Besides that he,
he's gotta stop drinking.

637
00:46:53,081 --> 00:46:56,724
I mean, ain't like I don't
wanna take care of it,

638
00:46:56,791 --> 00:47:00,686
but I leave at 7:00 in
the morning to go to work!

639
00:47:00,759 --> 00:47:03,182
Oh, let me
talk to him.

640
00:47:03,255 --> 00:47:06,386
I try to be a good wife to him,
Terence. I do. But you know,

641
00:47:06,455 --> 00:47:08,594
I got a limit, too.

642
00:47:08,663 --> 00:47:13,136
You know, he's got a drinking problem.
He says he's got a drinking problem.

643
00:47:13,207 --> 00:47:15,857
He wants to so something
about it. That's good.

644
00:47:15,926 --> 00:47:20,017
You know, he's been down this
road before and it didn't take.

645
00:47:20,086 --> 00:47:23,054
He wants to try it again. Good!

646
00:47:23,126 --> 00:47:27,566
But I, I say to him, why don't you
just stick to beer the way that I do,

647
00:47:27,638 --> 00:47:30,288
but he says
he can't do that.

648
00:47:30,357 --> 00:47:32,180
Hey, Pop.

649
00:47:32,245 --> 00:47:33,489
How are you doing?

650
00:47:33,557 --> 00:47:35,466
I thought you said
the meeting was at seven.

651
00:47:35,541 --> 00:47:37,745
I gotta get there early.
Set up the chairs.

652
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:38,761
I'll take you.

653
00:47:38,837 --> 00:47:40,364
She can do it.

654
00:47:40,436 --> 00:47:43,752
I came over to see you. Let me
take you for a ride, at least.

655
00:47:43,828 --> 00:47:46,195
You feed the dog?

656
00:47:47,476 --> 00:47:48,785
You feed the dog?

657
00:47:48,852 --> 00:47:50,674
I can take
care of him.

658
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:53,161
What are you
talking about?

659
00:47:53,236 --> 00:47:55,952
Genevieve told me a little
about what's going on.

660
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:58,092
I'll take the dog off
your hands for a while.

661
00:47:58,163 --> 00:48:00,018
How are you gonna
take care of a dog?

662
00:48:00,083 --> 00:48:04,305
I got a friend. She just loves
animals. All of them. Dogs, too.

663
00:48:06,419 --> 00:48:08,273
Let's go.

664
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:17,937
Have a good time!

665
00:48:35,248 --> 00:48:37,583
No. No!

666
00:48:38,705 --> 00:48:41,093
Fuck you.
Fuck you.

667
00:48:45,136 --> 00:48:47,405
Did we not discuss
this on the phone?

668
00:48:49,616 --> 00:48:52,365
How come you only call me
when you need something?

669
00:48:52,431 --> 00:48:53,893
You're fucked up,
aren't you?

670
00:48:53,968 --> 00:48:56,269
What? Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fucked up.

671
00:48:56,335 --> 00:48:57,710
What are you doing?

672
00:48:57,775 --> 00:48:59,847
I'm going to work. I have
to go to Biloxy tonight.

673
00:48:59,919 --> 00:49:01,577
Go to the hotel casino.

674
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:04,134
How are you gonna take care
of the dog if you're fucked up

675
00:49:04,206 --> 00:49:05,962
and you're going
to Biloxy?

676
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:08,812
All right. The doorman's
gonna walk him in the morning

677
00:49:08,878 --> 00:49:11,114
and I get back
in the afternoon.

678
00:49:11,182 --> 00:49:14,498
Oh, he's sweet.
What's his name?

679
00:49:15,981 --> 00:49:17,737
I don't know.

680
00:49:19,118 --> 00:49:20,874
You don't know
his name?

681
00:49:20,942 --> 00:49:22,283
I'll ask my father.

682
00:49:22,349 --> 00:49:23,810
You are unbelievable.

683
00:49:23,885 --> 00:49:25,511
I gotta get going.

684
00:49:25,581 --> 00:49:28,167
Unbelievable, you don't
know the dog's name.

685
00:49:28,236 --> 00:49:30,123
Baby, be nice to me.

686
00:49:32,044 --> 00:49:36,354
He smells.
You need a bath.

687
00:49:36,428 --> 00:49:39,591
Try to understand. It doesn't matter
that you were just along for the ride.

688
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:42,026
It doesn't matter that you
didn't actually shoot anybody.

689
00:49:42,092 --> 00:49:44,961
You're playing the prices now. The
price of "Big Fate" getting off,

690
00:49:45,036 --> 00:49:48,647
it's gonna help the DA
convict you and your boy "G. "

691
00:49:48,716 --> 00:49:51,366
I guarantee you that's
just what he's gonna do.

692
00:49:51,435 --> 00:49:53,126
Why don't you
smoke, man?

693
00:49:53,195 --> 00:49:54,569
What are you
talking about?

694
00:49:54,635 --> 00:49:57,285
I gotta listen
all this bullshit.

695
00:49:57,355 --> 00:49:58,631
Break out
to smoke, man.

696
00:49:58,699 --> 00:50:00,193
Flipping out on
us, Midget?

697
00:50:00,267 --> 00:50:03,016
No, man. Your partner lit
up a motherfucker blunt

698
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:04,643
before he put
the cuffs on me.

699
00:50:04,714 --> 00:50:07,299
I love this guy.

700
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:09,825
You say I smoked marijuana
in your presence? Huh?

701
00:50:09,897 --> 00:50:11,753
Cannabis? Is that
what you're saying?

702
00:50:11,818 --> 00:50:14,054
Right. Your word
against mine,

703
00:50:14,122 --> 00:50:16,706
so they fuck won't
believe me, right?

704
00:50:16,778 --> 00:50:18,850
Lieutenant.

705
00:50:18,921 --> 00:50:22,117
Lieutenant, can you
step out for a moment?

706
00:50:39,208 --> 00:50:41,858
My name is
Eugene Gratz, Lieutenant.

707
00:50:41,927 --> 00:50:46,051
I'm an attorney. This is
my client Donald Godshaw.

708
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:49,828
I understand you've
been looking for him.

709
00:50:49,894 --> 00:50:53,091
How can I help you?

710
00:51:06,405 --> 00:51:08,740
I just wanna talk to
these guys for a second.

711
00:51:08,806 --> 00:51:10,812
Why don't you
wait there?

712
00:51:12,773 --> 00:51:14,398
Gentlemen.

713
00:51:18,245 --> 00:51:20,187
Can I get you
a glass of water?

714
00:51:20,261 --> 00:51:22,049
Um, no, thanks.

715
00:51:22,116 --> 00:51:26,752
I gotta turn over the names of
my witnesses to Godshaw's lawyer.

716
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:30,136
As soon as I do that, Godshaw
will look to scare the kid.

717
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:32,666
He can't scare him,
he'll kill him.

718
00:51:32,739 --> 00:51:33,950
He'll never get to him.

719
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:35,646
Since Godshaw
turned himself in,

720
00:51:35,715 --> 00:51:38,617
I've authorized 24-hour
protection to start immediately.

721
00:51:38,691 --> 00:51:41,179
Just remember,
we have no prints,

722
00:51:41,252 --> 00:51:43,585
no DNA, no weapon.

723
00:51:43,651 --> 00:51:46,782
We lose the kid,
we lose the case.

724
00:51:46,851 --> 00:51:48,923
Understood?

725
00:51:56,706 --> 00:51:59,902
He's a nice dogs.
I just can't keep him.

726
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:02,457
She said she'd be back
at 1:00 this afternoon.

727
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:04,951
I'm off at 4:00, and I got
another job I gotta be at.

728
00:52:05,025 --> 00:52:06,454
She didn't call?

729
00:52:06,529 --> 00:52:08,155
No. And the night guy ain't
gonna go walk him.

730
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:10,942
I can't leave the animal in her
apartment. It might do damage.

731
00:52:11,009 --> 00:52:12,384
How did you
get my number?

732
00:52:12,449 --> 00:52:15,384
Miss Frankie gave it to
me in case of emergencies.

733
00:52:15,457 --> 00:52:17,432
Emergencies?

734
00:52:21,792 --> 00:52:24,574
This is what I'm talking about.
Doesn't pick up the phone.

735
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:30,171
She isn't where she's
supposed to be. Not showing up.

736
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:34,363
Terence, think they're gonna put
me on the witness stand by May 15?

737
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:36,187
Don't know, why?

738
00:52:36,255 --> 00:52:39,255
That's when my mom goes
in front of the parole board.

739
00:52:41,054 --> 00:52:44,218
I'm sure we can get people
to put in a good word for her.

740
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:47,608
Hello?

741
00:52:47,678 --> 00:52:49,653
Where are you?

742
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:54,066
I'm about an
hour from there.

743
00:52:54,142 --> 00:52:55,930
I'm on my way.

744
00:52:55,997 --> 00:52:58,845
Frankie, I'm on my way.

745
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:01,081
You ever been
to Biloxy?

746
00:53:53,913 --> 00:53:55,801
Now, you stand there.

747
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:57,359
Don't move.

748
00:53:57,433 --> 00:54:00,018
I'll be back
in five minutes.

749
00:54:01,785 --> 00:54:02,800
Baby.

750
00:54:02,874 --> 00:54:04,815
Hi, baby.
What are you doing?

751
00:54:04,889 --> 00:54:05,904
You all right?

752
00:54:05,977 --> 00:54:08,115
Yeah.

753
00:54:09,368 --> 00:54:10,645
You okay?

754
00:54:10,712 --> 00:54:12,567
Yeah.

755
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,203
Who did it?

756
00:54:17,272 --> 00:54:20,120
Do you have
anything for me?

757
00:54:20,184 --> 00:54:21,645
Some coke.

758
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,029
That's it?

759
00:54:23,095 --> 00:54:24,589
And Vicodin.

760
00:54:24,663 --> 00:54:26,485
I'll take both.

761
00:54:30,487 --> 00:54:32,788
What the fuck is
going on in here?

762
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:39,602
Who's this?

763
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:41,361
Hey, hey, hey!

764
00:54:41,429 --> 00:54:42,673
Take it easy.

765
00:54:42,741 --> 00:54:44,149
Just get my money.

766
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:45,839
What are you,
jealous boyfriend?

767
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:47,219
Just get me
my money.

768
00:54:47,286 --> 00:54:48,813
I usually pay
when I'm done.

769
00:54:48,886 --> 00:54:50,773
Done smacking her around?

770
00:54:50,837 --> 00:54:53,041
It was erotic shit, man.
I didn't hurt her.

771
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:55,243
Didn't that hurt?

772
00:54:55,317 --> 00:54:56,724
Did I hurt you?

773
00:54:56,789 --> 00:54:57,966
Terence, let's just go.

774
00:54:58,037 --> 00:55:00,274
We don't hit
women down south.

775
00:55:00,341 --> 00:55:02,674
You just made
a big mistake.

776
00:55:02,741 --> 00:55:05,741
My father is Andy Winnick,
you ever hear of him?

777
00:55:05,813 --> 00:55:08,114
One of the biggest
developers in the gulf coast.

778
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:09,390
Congratulations.

779
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:11,348
Tommy Leonardi is one
of his best friends.

780
00:55:11,412 --> 00:55:15,372
Listen, scumbag. Don't try to impress me
with you-father knows-some-guinea hood.

781
00:55:15,443 --> 00:55:17,407
What you gotta take
away from this experience

782
00:55:17,408 --> 00:55:19,371
is that if you ever see that girl again,

783
00:55:19,443 --> 00:55:22,672
you turn around and you walk in the
opposite direction. You got that?

784
00:55:22,739 --> 00:55:23,721
Yeah, man.

785
00:55:23,795 --> 00:55:25,617
I ever hear you so much
as look at that girl,

786
00:55:25,683 --> 00:55:28,433
you're gonna wish you
were born without a dick.

787
00:55:28,499 --> 00:55:33,485
Oh! Whoa, whoa,
whoa. Oh, whoa.

788
00:55:33,554 --> 00:55:36,937
Whoa. Big mistake.

789
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:39,181
Oh, yeah.

790
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:41,639
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

791
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:45,096
Big mistake.

792
00:55:50,833 --> 00:55:54,727
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

793
00:55:56,497 --> 00:55:58,504
Whoa.

794
00:56:00,817 --> 00:56:02,856
Oh, yeah.

795
00:56:06,063 --> 00:56:09,708
Daryl, this is Frankie.
Frankie, Daryl.

796
00:56:09,776 --> 00:56:12,143
Hi, Daryl.

797
00:56:12,208 --> 00:56:13,800
Hi.

798
00:56:29,293 --> 00:56:31,595
I gotta go talk
to someone.

799
00:56:31,662 --> 00:56:35,240
You go ahead and take
Frankie to the coffee shop.

800
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:37,895
And you stay with her.
You can do that, right?

801
00:56:37,966 --> 00:56:39,078
Yeah.

802
00:56:39,149 --> 00:56:40,556
Do you have
to do that now?

803
00:56:40,622 --> 00:56:42,410
I'll be with you
in a minute.

804
00:56:43,853 --> 00:56:46,122
Let's go?
Take care of me.

805
00:56:51,532 --> 00:56:53,256
What did Louisiana
go off at?

806
00:56:53,325 --> 00:56:54,983
Three-point underdogs.

807
00:56:55,053 --> 00:56:57,321
Three-point underdogs.
What are they losing by?

808
00:56:57,388 --> 00:56:58,816
Eight.

809
00:56:58,892 --> 00:57:00,486
Eight? What
the fuck is that?

810
00:57:00,556 --> 00:57:02,466
There's still two
minutes left to play.

811
00:57:04,363 --> 00:57:06,752
Louisiana ain't got
its passing game, friend.

812
00:57:06,828 --> 00:57:08,137
Good point.

813
00:57:08,203 --> 00:57:11,202
You wanna hear my picks
for the Pac-10?

814
00:57:11,275 --> 00:57:13,251
Do I look like
I wanna hear 'em?

815
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:29,700
Where is the kid?

816
00:57:29,769 --> 00:57:32,158
He went to the bathroom.

817
00:58:09,447 --> 00:58:12,414
Hi. Are there any other
bathrooms beside that one?

818
00:58:12,486 --> 00:58:14,559
Yeah, on the other side.

819
00:58:23,110 --> 00:58:27,649
Hey, man, insert
more coins.

820
00:58:27,717 --> 00:58:29,605
Insert more coins.

821
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:32,484
Insert more coins.

822
00:58:36,229 --> 00:58:39,197
Insert more coins.
Play again.

823
00:58:41,029 --> 00:58:42,938
Insert more coins.

824
00:58:46,532 --> 00:58:48,125
Insert more coins.

825
00:58:50,341 --> 00:58:52,162
What's going on?

826
00:58:52,227 --> 00:58:53,821
What did he say
when he left?

827
00:58:53,892 --> 00:58:56,193
He asked me if I'd be okay
waiting here by myself.

828
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:58,911
I said yeah. He said he had to go
to the bathroom. What is going on?

829
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:00,506
He's a witness
to a homicide.

830
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:01,561
To what?

831
00:59:01,635 --> 00:59:03,042
To five homicides.
Let's go.

832
00:59:03,107 --> 00:59:04,121
Where are we going?

833
00:59:04,194 --> 00:59:05,623
To find him.

834
01:00:28,316 --> 01:00:29,975
Where is he?

835
01:00:30,045 --> 01:00:32,019
Binnie, call security.

836
01:00:32,093 --> 01:00:34,133
Nobody's calling anybody.

837
01:00:34,205 --> 01:00:35,699
Where's your
grandson, Binnie?

838
01:00:35,773 --> 01:00:38,227
I don't have
to tell you anything.

839
01:00:42,523 --> 01:00:44,279
Yeah, you do.

840
01:00:44,348 --> 01:00:47,762
I haven't done anything. My
grandson hasn't done anything.

841
01:00:47,835 --> 01:00:51,250
If he doesn't wanna be a witness,
he doesn't have to be a witness.

842
01:00:51,323 --> 01:00:53,876
This is bigger
than one, two.

843
01:00:53,947 --> 01:00:55,769
This was a massacre.

844
01:00:55,835 --> 01:00:57,045
Children

845
01:00:58,586 --> 01:01:00,408
were executed.

846
01:01:00,475 --> 01:01:03,376
Maybe you should've
thought of that before.

847
01:01:06,938 --> 01:01:09,589
I need to know
where he is.

848
01:01:09,658 --> 01:01:14,393
Young man, I would like to
know the name of your superior.

849
01:01:16,410 --> 01:01:20,600
Right now I'm working on
about an hour and a half sleep

850
01:01:20,665 --> 01:01:22,574
over the past
three days.

851
01:01:22,649 --> 01:01:27,121
And I'm still trying
to remain courteous.

852
01:01:27,193 --> 01:01:31,927
And I'm beginning to think that that's
getting in the way of my being effective.

853
01:01:39,927 --> 01:01:41,837
What are you doing?

854
01:01:45,431 --> 01:01:48,366
What-what
are you doing?

855
01:01:49,399 --> 01:01:50,959
I wanna know

856
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:53,235
where Daryl is.

857
01:01:53,303 --> 01:01:54,579
My God.

858
01:01:54,647 --> 01:01:57,233
Nobody saw me come in.
Nobody knows I'm here.

859
01:01:57,302 --> 01:01:59,309
This old woman's
gonna run out of air,

860
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:02,797
and you're gonna have a tough time
convincing people that it wasn't you

861
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:07,474
who did it to her. And even if,
and even if you do convince them

862
01:02:07,541 --> 01:02:10,541
that you didn't
kill her on purpose,

863
01:02:10,614 --> 01:02:13,396
you're still gonna have a
tough time selling them that you

864
01:02:13,461 --> 01:02:16,396
took care of her
with a fuck!

865
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:17,996
Now, listen to me.

866
01:02:18,069 --> 01:02:20,719
Where the fuck is he?

867
01:02:22,389 --> 01:02:23,950
I said where
the fuck is he?

868
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:26,508
He's on an airplane.

869
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:28,969
Miss Antoinette
bought him a ticket

870
01:02:29,044 --> 01:02:32,557
and send him to live
with her family in England.

871
01:02:36,884 --> 01:02:40,232
All right, it's okay. That's okay.
That's a good girl. Suck it up.

872
01:02:40,307 --> 01:02:43,439
There you go. That's it. Take it
in. That's a good girl. Take it in.

873
01:02:43,508 --> 01:02:46,322
Good! Good.

874
01:02:46,387 --> 01:02:47,947
Good.

875
01:02:48,018 --> 01:02:49,993
That's it. Breathe.

876
01:02:50,067 --> 01:02:52,587
Maybe you should drop
dead, you selfish cunt.

877
01:02:52,658 --> 01:02:56,781
You ever think about your
kids or your grandkids? Huh?

878
01:02:56,850 --> 01:03:00,778
Sucking up their inheritance
through that fucked oxygen tube?

879
01:03:00,849 --> 01:03:03,271
And Binnie's fucked
intensive care?

880
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:06,832
You fucks, I hate you.
I hate you both.

881
01:03:08,881 --> 01:03:10,953
I should, I should
fucking both, right now,

882
01:03:11,025 --> 01:03:13,447
I should fucking
kill you fucking both.

883
01:03:15,344 --> 01:03:19,021
You're the fucking reason this
country's going down the drain.

884
01:03:34,959 --> 01:03:37,993
Watch out. He's not
in a good mood.

885
01:03:39,184 --> 01:03:40,808
Come in.

886
01:03:43,631 --> 01:03:45,605
Have a seat.

887
01:03:45,678 --> 01:03:48,428
Scotland Yard called.
The kid's in England.

888
01:03:48,494 --> 01:03:52,171
Make him a material witness.
Maybe Scotland Yard will hold him.

889
01:03:52,238 --> 01:03:55,304
Can't do that. He had no
involvement with the crime.

890
01:03:55,374 --> 01:03:57,512
He don't want testify,
we can't compel him.

891
01:03:57,581 --> 01:03:59,785
Well, we could still try
flipping one of the three.

892
01:03:59,853 --> 01:04:01,576
You can try
all what you want.

893
01:04:01,646 --> 01:04:04,547
Nobody flipping on Godshaw.
They're scared to death of him.

894
01:04:04,621 --> 01:04:07,588
As of now, all are
persons of interest.

895
01:04:07,661 --> 01:04:09,155
You gotta let him go.

896
01:04:09,229 --> 01:04:12,011
Oh, come on! Five homicides
and you're letting him go?

897
01:04:12,077 --> 01:04:14,630
You weren't supposed to let
the kid out of your sight.

898
01:04:14,701 --> 01:04:16,261
Be glad he didn't
turn up dead.

899
01:04:16,332 --> 01:04:17,226
This is bullshit.

900
01:04:17,292 --> 01:04:18,437
Get the hell outta here.

901
01:04:18,508 --> 01:04:20,035
You're not the one
on the street-

902
01:04:20,108 --> 01:04:21,767
Get out of my office.

903
01:04:21,836 --> 01:04:24,585
Risking our lives
on the street!

904
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:27,686
You know what's
involved, right?

905
01:04:27,756 --> 01:04:30,074
Maybe if we had a prosecutor
that worried about something

906
01:04:30,075 --> 01:04:32,993
besides his won lost record
we would stand a chance.

907
01:04:43,179 --> 01:04:45,600
What happened when you
went to see the grandmother?

908
01:04:45,675 --> 01:04:47,682
I told you.

909
01:04:47,754 --> 01:04:51,430
She said the woman she takes care of, bought
a plane ticket. He was on his way to England

910
01:04:51,497 --> 01:04:52,926
to stay with
her relatives.

911
01:04:53,002 --> 01:04:54,661
Any incidents took
place over there?

912
01:04:54,730 --> 01:04:56,136
What kind of incidents?

913
01:04:56,201 --> 01:04:57,379
Any kind.

914
01:04:57,449 --> 01:04:58,758
No.

915
01:05:00,202 --> 01:05:04,195
Whatever it is, you're gonna
wanna have your story down.

916
01:05:04,265 --> 01:05:06,851
Public Integrity is waiting
for you back at the house.

917
01:05:06,921 --> 01:05:08,928
Oh, come on. There gonna pull
Public Integrity into this?

918
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,429
What for?

919
01:05:10,504 --> 01:05:14,846
That old woman, her son is
a United States congressman.

920
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:20,611
I asked where
Daryl was.

921
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:23,713
His grandmother told me.

922
01:05:23,783 --> 01:05:28,387
You didn't, at any time,
threaten his grandmother?

923
01:05:28,455 --> 01:05:32,132
No, I did not.

924
01:05:32,199 --> 01:05:35,363
You didn't, at any time,
threaten Antoinette Fahringer?

925
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:37,122
No, I did not.

926
01:05:37,191 --> 01:05:40,868
You should know a formal complaint's
been filed alleging you cut off

927
01:05:40,935 --> 01:05:43,422
Mrs. Fahringer's
oxygen supply.

928
01:05:43,494 --> 01:05:46,461
Who's saying that?
Mrs. Fahringer?

929
01:05:46,534 --> 01:05:48,028
Is it true?

930
01:05:48,101 --> 01:05:50,687
I think she might be suffering
from a little dementia.

931
01:05:50,757 --> 01:05:52,960
Lieutenant, we're
asking if it's true.

932
01:05:53,029 --> 01:05:55,811
Absolutely not.

933
01:06:03,077 --> 01:06:04,800
Lieutenant.

934
01:06:06,468 --> 01:06:10,297
You know, I saw five of those
driving into work this morning.

935
01:06:10,372 --> 01:06:13,372
I want you to clean it up. Clean it up.

936
01:06:15,364 --> 01:06:18,298
Ned, excellent. You got
my message. Good. Come on.

937
01:06:18,371 --> 01:06:19,550
What message?

938
01:06:19,619 --> 01:06:21,343
You get the flowers
I sent? How's Jenny?

939
01:06:21,412 --> 01:06:23,233
What the fuck are
you talking about?

940
01:06:23,299 --> 01:06:24,727
Okay, that's good.

941
01:06:24,802 --> 01:06:25,784
Stop it!
Cut it out.

942
01:06:25,859 --> 01:06:27,037
What are you
doing here?

943
01:06:27,107 --> 01:06:28,569
What do you think?

944
01:06:28,643 --> 01:06:30,104
I don't have
anything for you.

945
01:06:30,179 --> 01:06:31,423
Then this is
a problem.

946
01:06:31,491 --> 01:06:33,083
Yeah, who
needs a problem?

947
01:06:33,154 --> 01:06:36,449
You owe me
five large, Terence.

948
01:06:36,514 --> 01:06:37,976
I haven't got it.

949
01:06:38,049 --> 01:06:40,155
Then, you gotta
give me something.

950
01:06:40,226 --> 01:06:44,120
Give me goods if you don't
have cash. Give me a gold Rolex.

951
01:06:44,194 --> 01:06:46,299
Ned, I look like
I got a gold Rolex?

952
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:48,858
Don't pine me for
a fucking stooge.

953
01:06:48,930 --> 01:06:51,101
Keep your voice down.
Just keep it down.

954
01:06:51,170 --> 01:06:54,617
Don't play me
for a fucking stooge.

955
01:06:54,689 --> 01:06:56,282
Are you done?

956
01:06:56,353 --> 01:06:59,669
Do you think these guys care
you're a cop? They will fuck you up

957
01:06:59,745 --> 01:07:01,501
just like
everybody else.

958
01:07:01,569 --> 01:07:03,543
Let me get something
down with the Texas game.

959
01:07:03,616 --> 01:07:05,721
'Cause that's where
the season turns a lot.

960
01:07:05,792 --> 01:07:07,799
No.

961
01:07:07,872 --> 01:07:12,628
Nothing. You pay
what the fuck you owe.

962
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:19,926
I'm a little late on
my rent, that's all.

963
01:07:19,999 --> 01:07:22,301
Lieutenant.

964
01:07:22,367 --> 01:07:26,709
Uh, somebody named
Frankie called.

965
01:07:52,668 --> 01:07:53,912
What's going on?

966
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:57,296
All kinds of things.
Come closer. I'm Dave.

967
01:07:57,372 --> 01:07:58,452
Who are you?

968
01:07:58,524 --> 01:07:59,538
Andy.

969
01:07:59,613 --> 01:08:00,790
Jeff.

970
01:08:00,860 --> 01:08:02,551
What do you want?

971
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:06,482
What I want right now is to
get this behind position right.

972
01:08:06,555 --> 01:08:07,799
He wants money.

973
01:08:07,868 --> 01:08:09,461
Who are you?

974
01:08:09,532 --> 01:08:13,012
Sit down. I told you, I'm Dave.

975
01:08:13,083 --> 01:08:16,912
And the guy you robbed,
I know told you he was.

976
01:08:16,987 --> 01:08:19,834
You make a date with a
pretty girl. You gotta pay.

977
01:08:21,595 --> 01:08:24,345
Dear. Like this.

978
01:08:24,411 --> 01:08:29,974
You want the schwantz, not
the prosty. See? That's it.

979
01:08:30,042 --> 01:08:33,839
When you engage with another human being,
we remind ourselves we're not alone.

980
01:08:33,914 --> 01:08:36,630
Plus, who knows, maybe we
even learn a little something.

981
01:08:36,697 --> 01:08:38,258
How much?

982
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:41,264
You took 10 off. To make it
right, you gotta come up with 50.

983
01:08:41,337 --> 01:08:42,766
No, that's bullshit.

984
01:08:42,841 --> 01:08:45,110
No, it's punitive damages.
What can I tell you?

985
01:08:45,177 --> 01:08:47,281
I don't get it. She kept
up her end of the bargain.

986
01:08:47,353 --> 01:08:48,814
He says no.

987
01:08:48,889 --> 01:08:51,409
He's a fucking liar. I did
everything he asked me to do.

988
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:53,138
Which was what?

989
01:08:53,208 --> 01:08:55,510
You want details?

990
01:08:55,576 --> 01:08:57,648
You sick people.

991
01:08:57,720 --> 01:09:01,779
Oh, listen to her stand up
for herself. The indignation.

992
01:09:01,847 --> 01:09:03,221
I love it.

993
01:09:03,288 --> 01:09:04,597
Where's the money?

994
01:09:04,663 --> 01:09:06,703
In my bag.

995
01:09:09,911 --> 01:09:11,634
It's all here?

996
01:09:11,703 --> 01:09:14,866
Okay. Here are
five thousand.

997
01:09:14,934 --> 01:09:16,462
There's ten
in change here.

998
01:09:16,535 --> 01:09:18,738
Why don't I give you
this, call a day.

999
01:09:18,806 --> 01:09:23,661
We could do that. Alternatively, I
could tell Jeffy to shoot the dog.

1000
01:09:23,734 --> 01:09:26,636
Do you want me
to shoot the fucking dog?

1001
01:09:28,534 --> 01:09:31,600
Or put my calling card on
this gorgeous punum here.

1002
01:09:31,670 --> 01:09:33,458
I don't give a shit
about the dog.

1003
01:09:33,526 --> 01:09:36,754
But you mark her up, I'm gonna have
a tough time getting you your money.

1004
01:09:36,821 --> 01:09:38,414
By my money you
mean $50,000.

1005
01:09:38,485 --> 01:09:39,762
I'll need a
couple of days.

1006
01:09:39,829 --> 01:09:41,487
By a couple
you mean two.

1007
01:09:41,557 --> 01:09:42,734
Yeah.

1008
01:09:42,805 --> 01:09:44,299
Good.

1009
01:09:44,373 --> 01:09:45,779
Hey.

1010
01:09:45,844 --> 01:09:48,365
I know. Relax.

1011
01:09:48,436 --> 01:09:51,981
The boys wanna saddle her up just
in the spirit of friendliness.

1012
01:09:52,051 --> 01:09:53,480
You mind?

1013
01:09:53,556 --> 01:09:56,556
Well, let her get cleaned
up, put on something hot.

1014
01:09:56,628 --> 01:09:58,483
She looks like
shit right now.

1015
01:09:58,548 --> 01:09:59,660
Beautiful.

1016
01:09:59,731 --> 01:10:01,519
What are you
waiting for?

1017
01:10:04,403 --> 01:10:06,191
I don't wanna put
any pressure on you,

1018
01:10:06,259 --> 01:10:08,976
but she has a client
coming over in 15 minutes.

1019
01:10:09,043 --> 01:10:10,668
You boys can be
done by then, right?

1020
01:10:10,739 --> 01:10:12,463
The both of us?

1021
01:10:12,531 --> 01:10:15,465
They'd had been done in 15
seconds you hadn't mentioned it.

1022
01:10:15,539 --> 01:10:16,782
My mistake.

1023
01:10:16,851 --> 01:10:18,793
You'll hit her
when we come back.

1024
01:10:18,867 --> 01:10:21,354
Two days, same time,
same station, yes?

1025
01:10:21,426 --> 01:10:23,248
Okay. You got it, baby.

1026
01:10:23,314 --> 01:10:25,867
Don't make me look
for you, Terence.

1027
01:10:57,552 --> 01:10:59,558
They're gone.

1028
01:11:02,447 --> 01:11:05,382
I'm gonna take you
to my father's house.

1029
01:11:05,456 --> 01:11:07,877
Buy some time at least.

1030
01:11:09,550 --> 01:11:11,405
Frankie.

1031
01:11:12,590 --> 01:11:14,117
They're gone.

1032
01:11:21,677 --> 01:11:22,954
I can't take her.

1033
01:11:23,150 --> 01:11:26,498
I just need a place where she
can stay for a couple of days.

1034
01:11:26,574 --> 01:11:28,810
Why can't you put her
up in your place?

1035
01:11:28,878 --> 01:11:32,193
I can't take a chance these
guys find out where I live, Dad.

1036
01:11:32,269 --> 01:11:35,116
Christ!

1037
01:11:35,180 --> 01:11:37,766
They gave me the job of
bringing cookies to a meeting.

1038
01:11:37,837 --> 01:11:39,877
It takes me half
a day to get it done.

1039
01:11:39,949 --> 01:11:42,053
You want me to
baby-sit a pros?

1040
01:11:42,125 --> 01:11:43,815
You don't have
to baby-sit her.

1041
01:11:43,884 --> 01:11:45,859
She's very
self-suficient.

1042
01:11:45,932 --> 01:11:50,601
Well, I'm not in any kind of shape
to take on something like this.

1043
01:11:50,668 --> 01:11:52,970
Look, I get home
from one meeting.

1044
01:11:53,036 --> 01:11:57,061
I lie on the couch and I wait till
it's time for the next meeting.

1045
01:11:57,131 --> 01:11:59,171
That's all I
can do right now.

1046
01:11:59,243 --> 01:12:01,348
Let your wife
deal with her.

1047
01:12:01,419 --> 01:12:03,655
They'll get along
like sisters.

1048
01:12:03,722 --> 01:12:06,111
Get away from me, you rag.

1049
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:12,134
My husband is trying to quit drinking
and you bring this shit into our house?

1050
01:12:12,202 --> 01:12:15,333
Give it back or I'll swear to
God I will stab you in the heart.

1051
01:12:15,402 --> 01:12:17,605
I will stab you
in the heart.

1052
01:12:17,673 --> 01:12:19,778
What kind of trash
you're bringing in here?

1053
01:12:19,849 --> 01:12:22,500
She's going through my
bag! My personal shit!

1054
01:12:22,569 --> 01:12:23,943
Everybody calm down.

1055
01:12:24,009 --> 01:12:25,635
It's hard enough
for your father.

1056
01:12:25,705 --> 01:12:28,291
He's gotta put up with
narcotics under his nose.

1057
01:12:28,361 --> 01:12:32,638
Oh, God. It can't be any worse than you
being shit face on beer all the time.

1058
01:12:32,712 --> 01:12:34,654
Enough!

1059
01:12:34,729 --> 01:12:37,095
You tell her I'm
shit face all the time?

1060
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:39,494
Oh, it's pretty
fucking obvious, lady!

1061
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:42,430
Oh, yeah?
You fucking whore.

1062
01:12:42,504 --> 01:12:46,017
Watch this. Come get
it. Come fucking get it.

1063
01:12:46,088 --> 01:12:49,470
Get her outta here. I
can't deal with this shit.

1064
01:12:49,543 --> 01:12:51,332
You cunt.

1065
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:52,926
Hey, the neighbors!

1066
01:12:52,999 --> 01:12:54,854
You're a cunt,
you whore.

1067
01:12:54,919 --> 01:12:57,254
I'll fuck you up.

1068
01:12:57,318 --> 01:13:00,352
We come in
or you come out?

1069
01:13:00,423 --> 01:13:03,237
Alright, come on,
let's go.

1070
01:13:03,302 --> 01:13:06,750
So, uh, Francesca
Donnenfeld. Do you know her?

1071
01:13:06,822 --> 01:13:09,985
Just cut the bullshit, Yasco,
and tell me what you're here for.

1072
01:13:10,053 --> 01:13:11,744
I'm Yasco.

1073
01:13:11,813 --> 01:13:14,912
Here's the thing, tough guy. You
keep fucking with the wrong people.

1074
01:13:14,982 --> 01:13:17,851
First the old lady, now your
prostitute friend's customer.

1075
01:13:17,926 --> 01:13:21,723
The old lady, you might've written
out. She, uh, doesn't remember so good.

1076
01:13:21,797 --> 01:13:25,212
The colored nurse, she's covering
for the grandson, whatever.

1077
01:13:25,284 --> 01:13:27,968
But why I get a call
from the chief D's office

1078
01:13:28,036 --> 01:13:30,905
that you've shaken down
your pros friend's customer

1079
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:35,715
whose father's hung all the way
from here to fucking City Hall.

1080
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:37,919
You're done, Lieutenant.

1081
01:13:37,987 --> 01:13:39,449
What do you want?

1082
01:13:39,524 --> 01:13:41,563
Your gun, for starters.

1083
01:13:42,979 --> 01:13:44,190
Come on.

1084
01:13:51,395 --> 01:13:53,020
Until the outcome
of the hearing,

1085
01:13:53,090 --> 01:13:55,064
you're on modified duty.

1086
01:13:55,138 --> 01:13:58,521
Better call your delegate.
You got an ass kicking coming.

1087
01:14:00,322 --> 01:14:02,460
You have a good
day, Lieutenant.

1088
01:14:14,337 --> 01:14:17,632
A man without a
gun is not a man.

1089
01:14:17,697 --> 01:14:20,598
Oh, well, I know. Look, you
cut the best deal you can

1090
01:14:20,673 --> 01:14:24,088
and you get the hell out of the Police
Department. 'Cause if you stay in,

1091
01:14:24,161 --> 01:14:26,015
it's gonna get worse.

1092
01:14:26,081 --> 01:14:28,285
Can I talk to you
for a second?

1093
01:14:28,353 --> 01:14:32,313
I can't stay here. I didn't
take this shit from my own mother

1094
01:14:32,384 --> 01:14:34,075
and I'm not gonna
take it from her.

1095
01:14:34,144 --> 01:14:37,973
Can I get a minute alone
with my girlfriend?

1096
01:14:38,048 --> 01:14:41,844
Just give her a day or two.
She's gonna calm down, I promise.

1097
01:14:41,919 --> 01:14:45,236
I'm so, I'm so happy
you're here.

1098
01:14:45,311 --> 01:14:49,053
And I got something
else I want to show you.

1099
01:14:49,119 --> 01:14:51,737
She's really mean.

1100
01:15:09,214 --> 01:15:11,352
I wanna show you
this place.

1101
01:15:12,381 --> 01:15:15,479
I spent a lot
of time here

1102
01:15:15,548 --> 01:15:17,719
when I was a boy.

1103
01:15:17,789 --> 01:15:19,577
That doesn't
work anymore.

1104
01:15:19,644 --> 01:15:22,360
I was here
alone a lot.

1105
01:15:23,708 --> 01:15:27,286
This was my
special place

1106
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:28,850
as a child.

1107
01:15:30,076 --> 01:15:33,043
My, my castle.

1108
01:15:33,116 --> 01:15:37,491
And I would imagine things
here. Pirates, a buried treasure.

1109
01:15:37,563 --> 01:15:42,320
And my dad didn't like that so
much, but my mom, she, she got it.

1110
01:15:42,395 --> 01:15:45,144
And, uh, and
before she died,

1111
01:15:45,211 --> 01:15:49,039
she bought me a metal detector.
Come on, let me show you something.

1112
01:15:49,114 --> 01:15:51,416
Look at that.
Right out there,

1113
01:15:51,482 --> 01:15:56,239
I thought that pirates
came up the Mississippi

1114
01:15:56,314 --> 01:16:00,886
and that they buried a treasure right
there by that tree next to the house.

1115
01:16:00,954 --> 01:16:04,369
So I, I took the metal
detector my mom gave me

1116
01:16:04,442 --> 01:16:06,929
and I went out there with
it and it start beeping.

1117
01:16:07,001 --> 01:16:09,489
It was like beep-beep,
beep, beep, beep.

1118
01:16:09,561 --> 01:16:13,041
And I started digging, and
I-I-I dug and I dug and I dug,

1119
01:16:13,113 --> 01:16:18,579
and I found a, a Sterling
silver spoon, and I was so happy.

1120
01:16:18,648 --> 01:16:21,909
I started screaming
and jumping and laughing.

1121
01:16:21,976 --> 01:16:24,529
And I went, "Hey, man,
this is treasure.

1122
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:28,244
This is pirate treasure. " And
I came back in here with it.

1123
01:16:29,719 --> 01:16:33,014
And I hid it somewhere,
this Sterling silver spoon.

1124
01:16:33,079 --> 01:16:35,021
I still can't find it.

1125
01:16:36,119 --> 01:16:37,875
It could be anywhere.

1126
01:16:39,703 --> 01:16:41,939
I-I know it's here.

1127
01:16:53,046 --> 01:16:55,184
I don't know what
to tell you, Terence.

1128
01:16:55,254 --> 01:16:57,261
Not a lot I can do
under the circumstances.

1129
01:16:57,333 --> 01:16:59,406
I know.

1130
01:17:01,333 --> 01:17:05,490
I tell you guys all the time, you cannot
get away with that cowboy shit anymore.

1131
01:17:05,556 --> 01:17:09,353
You don't listen, now
this is where were at.

1132
01:17:09,428 --> 01:17:13,105
My best fucking detective, I
gotta put him in the property room.

1133
01:17:39,475 --> 01:17:41,646
Terence, come on.

1134
01:17:41,714 --> 01:17:44,299
Man, I-I don't wanna you get
jammed off for all of this.

1135
01:17:44,370 --> 01:17:48,462
You're doing all this wrong shit and I'm
here. They're gonna think I'm doing it, too.

1136
01:17:48,529 --> 01:17:52,042
So, go to the store warehouse in
Metairie that way you're not here.

1137
01:17:52,113 --> 01:17:55,975
And while you're there, get me my.
45 Magnum and bring it to me. Okay?

1138
01:18:02,001 --> 01:18:04,270
Hey.

1139
01:18:04,337 --> 01:18:05,963
You're working here?

1140
01:18:06,032 --> 01:18:08,301
Looks like.
What you got there?

1141
01:18:08,368 --> 01:18:11,980
Nine, ten grams of
heroin and a Glock nine.

1142
01:18:12,048 --> 01:18:15,277
Yeah. You see that
scale over there?

1143
01:18:15,344 --> 01:18:16,805
It's broken.

1144
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:19,784
See? useless.

1145
01:18:19,855 --> 01:18:21,578
I sent for a new one.

1146
01:18:21,648 --> 01:18:24,549
As soon as it gets here,
I'll weigh the drugs

1147
01:18:24,623 --> 01:18:26,445
and I'll get you
your voucher, okay?

1148
01:18:26,512 --> 01:18:27,821
All right, bye-bye.

1149
01:18:36,398 --> 01:18:38,765
Can I help you, sir?
Can I help you, sir?

1150
01:18:44,077 --> 01:18:45,866
Can I talk
to you a minute?

1151
01:18:45,934 --> 01:18:47,243
Excuse me?

1152
01:18:47,310 --> 01:18:49,797
Mind stepping outside?
I'd like to talk to you.

1153
01:18:51,565 --> 01:18:54,315
You interrupted my meal.

1154
01:18:54,381 --> 01:18:58,090
I'm gonna pretend to be polite, so you
look a big man in front of your friends.

1155
01:18:58,156 --> 01:19:00,611
You give me a hard time,
I'll put the cuffs on you

1156
01:19:00,684 --> 01:19:02,855
just like any
other shitbird.

1157
01:19:05,579 --> 01:19:06,823
I'll be back.

1158
01:19:06,891 --> 01:19:07,906
You a'ight?

1159
01:19:07,980 --> 01:19:09,474
Motherfucker wanna
talk to me.

1160
01:19:09,547 --> 01:19:12,165
You ain't gonna shoot me,
are you, motherfucker?

1161
01:19:12,236 --> 01:19:14,178
Why would I do that?

1162
01:19:21,034 --> 01:19:23,401
I got something for you
I think you're gonna like.

1163
01:19:23,466 --> 01:19:24,775
Let's take a walk.

1164
01:19:33,642 --> 01:19:36,009
You crazy for
coming down here.

1165
01:19:38,186 --> 01:19:41,316
I'm gonna give you a chance to
make some money the old fashion way

1166
01:19:41,385 --> 01:19:43,426
with a cop protecting you.

1167
01:19:43,497 --> 01:19:44,926
What I need
protection from?

1168
01:19:45,001 --> 01:19:46,430
Other cops.

1169
01:19:46,505 --> 01:19:50,400
A cop will protect
me from cops?

1170
01:19:50,473 --> 01:19:52,960
You'll know when a supplier
is under surveillance.

1171
01:19:53,032 --> 01:19:55,935
You'll know when it's safe to
make a pick up, when it's not.

1172
01:19:56,008 --> 01:19:57,251
What I gotta give you?

1173
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:59,044
Fifteen thousand
a shipment.

1174
01:19:59,113 --> 01:20:01,184
Oh, I'm sorry,
am I being unfair?

1175
01:20:02,472 --> 01:20:04,544
How I know you ain't
looking to set me up?

1176
01:20:04,616 --> 01:20:07,682
Tomorrow I'll bring you
some information. Small shit.

1177
01:20:07,752 --> 01:20:10,402
You decide if you wanna
go to the next step.

1178
01:20:12,295 --> 01:20:15,710
What about the murders? You don't
give the fuck about them no more?

1179
01:20:15,783 --> 01:20:18,849
Look at me.
Now look at you.

1180
01:20:18,919 --> 01:20:20,577
I never did.

1181
01:20:53,572 --> 01:20:56,093
Hey, I got the weight
on that dope finally.

1182
01:20:56,165 --> 01:20:57,474
Thanks.

1183
01:21:01,219 --> 01:21:03,129
That's all there was?

1184
01:21:03,204 --> 01:21:05,472
I'll double check it
if you want.

1185
01:21:09,379 --> 01:21:11,965
Don't matter. Still
got enough for felony.

1186
01:21:12,035 --> 01:21:14,009
What are you guys
got going on today?

1187
01:21:14,083 --> 01:21:17,857
Buying bust on Fourth and
Ferret on Andre's outfit.

1188
01:21:17,922 --> 01:21:19,897
Happy hunting.

1189
01:21:31,042 --> 01:21:35,449
Undercover just busted one
on Andre's. Fourth and Ferret.

1190
01:21:35,522 --> 01:21:38,172
What do you know?

1191
01:21:38,241 --> 01:21:40,314
Man of your word.

1192
01:21:41,473 --> 01:21:43,709
Are you running me
back to my car?

1193
01:21:43,776 --> 01:21:47,966
Yeah. I need to make a stop
first. Is that all right?

1194
01:21:48,033 --> 01:21:49,887
Yes.

1195
01:22:08,159 --> 01:22:11,640
This, this is prime
real estate.

1196
01:22:11,710 --> 01:22:13,532
Doesn't look prime.

1197
01:22:13,598 --> 01:22:16,697
See, that's the point.
Now is the time to get in.

1198
01:22:16,766 --> 01:22:20,824
Two, three years from now, all
this we'll be river front condos.

1199
01:22:20,893 --> 01:22:22,716
Marble floors,
health spas.

1200
01:22:22,782 --> 01:22:25,465
By that time, another
motherfucker made all the money.

1201
01:22:25,534 --> 01:22:27,989
Don't be going legit
on me now, "Big".

1202
01:22:28,062 --> 01:22:29,785
Money's money.

1203
01:22:29,853 --> 01:22:32,886
Tell you what. You'll be the front man,

1204
01:22:32,957 --> 01:22:35,706
I'll be the power
behind the throne.

1205
01:22:37,628 --> 01:22:40,214
It's like we're working
for a greater good.

1206
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:43,249
Yeah, you're right.

1207
01:22:43,325 --> 01:22:45,332
This is a good spot
to build condominiums.

1208
01:22:45,403 --> 01:22:48,884
See? I know I likes you, man. Come on.

1209
01:23:50,231 --> 01:23:52,597
May I ask you to step
out of the vehicle?

1210
01:23:52,663 --> 01:23:53,873
What'd I do?

1211
01:23:53,943 --> 01:23:55,852
You bought dope. I watched you buy dope.

1212
01:23:55,926 --> 01:23:57,835
Now stand the fuck up.

1213
01:24:02,135 --> 01:24:03,728
Put your hands
on the car.

1214
01:24:03,799 --> 01:24:06,581
I didn't-I didn't
buy nothing, man.

1215
01:24:08,053 --> 01:24:10,126
No? What's this?

1216
01:24:10,198 --> 01:24:11,376
Officer, please, let-

1217
01:24:11,446 --> 01:24:12,623
Please what?

1218
01:24:12,694 --> 01:24:14,865
I don't know how
that shit got in there.

1219
01:24:14,933 --> 01:24:15,980
Did I put it there?

1220
01:24:16,054 --> 01:24:17,363
No, sir.

1221
01:24:17,430 --> 01:24:18,411
Just some
freaking currants?

1222
01:24:18,486 --> 01:24:20,754
Yes, sir.

1223
01:24:20,821 --> 01:24:22,677
That's what you
tell the judge, then.

1224
01:24:22,741 --> 01:24:25,840
Maybe you'll get lucky and
he will be a football fan.

1225
01:24:25,909 --> 01:24:27,283
You know who I am?

1226
01:24:27,349 --> 01:24:29,291
Oh, I know who you are.

1227
01:24:29,365 --> 01:24:31,307
Then why you wanna
fuck my life up for?

1228
01:24:31,381 --> 01:24:33,999
That's gonna knock me
out the draft.

1229
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:36,719
I'm sure you'll get a contract
of some kind eventually.

1230
01:24:36,788 --> 01:24:39,057
You run the 40 and what?
What's that, four-three?

1231
01:24:40,660 --> 01:24:42,121
Why do you do
this to me?

1232
01:24:42,196 --> 01:24:45,011
For some motherfucking
marijuana, man.

1233
01:24:45,076 --> 01:24:47,377
I was gonna by
my mama house.

1234
01:24:47,444 --> 01:24:51,186
So, you're going off for six
points favorites against Texas.

1235
01:24:51,251 --> 01:24:56,335
You win by five or less or you lose
altogether, none of this ever happened.

1236
01:24:57,459 --> 01:24:59,084
Sir, I can't do that.

1237
01:24:59,155 --> 01:25:02,318
A fumble, a missed blocking
assignment. You can absolutely do it.

1238
01:25:02,386 --> 01:25:04,971
Sir, please. Please,
don't make me do that.

1239
01:25:05,041 --> 01:25:06,700
Listen to me, Renaldo.

1240
01:25:06,770 --> 01:25:09,737
I dumped a lot of
money this year on you.

1241
01:25:09,810 --> 01:25:13,355
I got the chance to get some of that
back, I wanna take advantage of it.

1242
01:25:13,426 --> 01:25:16,775
You're gonna tell me the integrity
of the game is too much to you, fine.

1243
01:25:16,850 --> 01:25:19,948
I wouldn't dream of trying to convince
you to go against your conscience.

1244
01:25:20,017 --> 01:25:23,365
Turn around. I'm
placing you under arrest.

1245
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:27,084
You-you won't
tell nobody.

1246
01:25:29,425 --> 01:25:32,009
You ain't gonna
tell nobody?

1247
01:26:08,526 --> 01:26:12,103
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. This that
Taliban shit. That's what's this is.

1248
01:26:12,173 --> 01:26:15,402
That shit Osama give a motherfucker
before they blow themselves up.

1249
01:26:15,469 --> 01:26:17,509
That's money.
Money.

1250
01:26:17,581 --> 01:26:19,468
Shut up!

1251
01:26:20,685 --> 01:26:22,374
Where's the 15,000?

1252
01:26:22,444 --> 01:26:24,778
You'll get it, man. Relax.

1253
01:26:24,844 --> 01:26:29,546
Did I not do what I
said I was going to do?

1254
01:26:29,612 --> 01:26:32,995
Yeah, man.
Relax.

1255
01:26:33,068 --> 01:26:36,449
Tell me again to relax.

1256
01:26:38,411 --> 01:26:40,832
I'm not looking
to beat you, man.

1257
01:26:41,994 --> 01:26:43,587
Where's my money?

1258
01:26:43,660 --> 01:26:44,739
I'll get your money.

1259
01:26:44,811 --> 01:26:45,759
When?

1260
01:26:45,834 --> 01:26:46,783
Tomorrow.

1261
01:26:46,858 --> 01:26:48,167
Where?

1262
01:26:48,234 --> 01:26:49,642
My place.

1263
01:26:50,763 --> 01:26:52,901
Give me a cut of
the uncut dope.

1264
01:26:52,970 --> 01:26:55,206
Look, I'm gonna
pay you in money.

1265
01:26:55,274 --> 01:26:56,648
This is interest.

1266
01:26:56,714 --> 01:26:58,142
That's bullshit, man.

1267
01:26:58,217 --> 01:26:59,940
What's that, little man?

1268
01:27:00,010 --> 01:27:03,173
Midge, chill out.

1269
01:27:03,241 --> 01:27:04,900
Here.

1270
01:27:06,408 --> 01:27:09,954
Now, put that gun away
before you kill somebody.

1271
01:27:11,241 --> 01:27:13,129
I'll kill all of you.

1272
01:27:14,729 --> 01:27:16,802
To the break of dawn.

1273
01:27:22,216 --> 01:27:25,085
To the break
of dawn, baby.

1274
01:27:28,487 --> 01:27:33,538
Wassup, wassup, wassup
wassup, motherfucker?

1275
01:27:33,608 --> 01:27:35,876
No fucking
bets, Terence.

1276
01:27:35,943 --> 01:27:37,602
What's the matter?
You don't like me?

1277
01:27:37,670 --> 01:27:40,605
You don't pay your debts. I don't
wanna know you. I can't afford it.

1278
01:27:40,679 --> 01:27:43,199
Ten grand!
Five I owe.

1279
01:27:43,271 --> 01:27:47,777
Yeah? Five for Louisiana.
Right there. Wassup?

1280
01:27:47,846 --> 01:27:49,090
Where did you get this?

1281
01:27:49,158 --> 01:27:51,493
What, are you my priest?
Right there, here.

1282
01:27:51,558 --> 01:27:52,965
You got it.

1283
01:27:53,029 --> 01:27:54,458
It's a six-point spread.

1284
01:27:54,534 --> 01:27:56,225
No shit.

1285
01:28:02,276 --> 01:28:04,099
Frankie?

1286
01:28:10,372 --> 01:28:11,801
Frankie!

1287
01:28:20,579 --> 01:28:22,106
Hey.

1288
01:28:22,180 --> 01:28:23,838
I got something for you.

1289
01:28:23,907 --> 01:28:25,695
I need to get
my clothes.

1290
01:28:25,764 --> 01:28:29,146
Don't worry about your clothes
right now. This is uncut dope.

1291
01:28:29,219 --> 01:28:32,961
Just a bunch of stuff from my closet
and then from my dresser by the bed.

1292
01:28:33,027 --> 01:28:37,020
I'm not gonna give you much until we know
how strong it is 'cause it's pure, you know?

1293
01:28:37,090 --> 01:28:39,424
Baby, I've been talking
to your father a lot

1294
01:28:39,491 --> 01:28:41,912
and I think I'm gonna go
to a meeting with him.

1295
01:28:44,802 --> 01:28:48,544
What does that mean?
You don't want any?

1296
01:28:48,609 --> 01:28:52,471
I mean, of course I want some
but I, maybe when I get back.

1297
01:28:52,545 --> 01:28:55,960
Frankie. Frankie,
we gotta go.

1298
01:28:56,930 --> 01:28:59,417
Okay? Right.

1299
01:29:56,093 --> 01:29:57,337
Thank you.

1300
01:30:18,299 --> 01:30:20,273
This the way
to do business.

1301
01:30:20,347 --> 01:30:24,625
This, this way I ain't gotta
worry about what I'm walking into.

1302
01:30:24,698 --> 01:30:26,770
I got you.

1303
01:30:28,090 --> 01:30:29,999
Yeah, let me hit
that shit.

1304
01:30:37,210 --> 01:30:39,185
Yeah.

1305
01:30:45,369 --> 01:30:47,027
You hitting this shit?

1306
01:30:48,696 --> 01:30:52,820
Hey, Midget, light
the Caucasian's rock.

1307
01:31:00,184 --> 01:31:03,315
You're my kind of
motherfucking cop, man.

1308
01:31:03,384 --> 01:31:05,489
You're a crazy,
motherfucker.

1309
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:07,567
What did that Ki run you.

1310
01:31:08,601 --> 01:31:09,680
What do you care?

1311
01:31:09,752 --> 01:31:11,029
I'm guessing 60,000.

1312
01:31:11,095 --> 01:31:12,143
Very good guess.

1313
01:31:12,215 --> 01:31:14,102
Will you shut
the fuck up?

1314
01:31:14,167 --> 01:31:17,778
You owe me 15 thousand. I'll
take 25% of the dope uncut.

1315
01:31:17,847 --> 01:31:19,570
That means you're
getting my price.

1316
01:31:19,639 --> 01:31:22,028
It's one way
of looking at it.

1317
01:31:22,103 --> 01:31:26,542
The other is, you get to keep 75% and not
go to prison for the rest of your life.

1318
01:31:32,438 --> 01:31:33,714
Yeah.

1319
01:31:33,782 --> 01:31:35,309
Go ahead.

1320
01:31:35,381 --> 01:31:37,803
Make sure you cut that
shit before you sell it,

1321
01:31:37,877 --> 01:31:40,049
unless you wanna kill the
motherfucker who buys it.

1322
01:31:40,117 --> 01:31:42,419
Did I ever tell you the
story about nigger Elk?

1323
01:31:42,485 --> 01:31:44,274
I was watching TV,
the game, right?

1324
01:31:44,341 --> 01:31:47,275
Reynaldo Hayes, He got tossed
the ball. He was running with it.

1325
01:31:47,349 --> 01:31:49,488
He jumped over three
linebackers in midair.

1326
01:31:49,557 --> 01:31:52,623
He sprouted antlers
like a gazelle.

1327
01:31:52,693 --> 01:31:54,099
Like an elk.

1328
01:31:54,165 --> 01:31:55,822
He landed again.
He ran, ran, ran.

1329
01:31:55,892 --> 01:31:57,069
He scored a touchdown!

1330
01:31:59,731 --> 01:32:01,357
Crack talking.

1331
01:32:01,428 --> 01:32:04,526
Listen, I'm not worried about you,
so don't be concerned about me.

1332
01:32:04,595 --> 01:32:08,905
'Cause I'm not concerned if you're not
concerned. I'm not really concerned.

1333
01:32:08,979 --> 01:32:10,735
I'm worried 'cause
if you drop dead,

1334
01:32:10,803 --> 01:32:13,006
I'm the motherfucker
they come looking for.

1335
01:32:13,074 --> 01:32:15,692
And then I gotta end up
having a nigger from Africa

1336
01:32:15,763 --> 01:32:17,355
trying to move in
on my shit.

1337
01:32:17,426 --> 01:32:20,623
And I don't wanna shoot no more
purple ass niggers from Africa.

1338
01:32:20,691 --> 01:32:23,854
Easy, easy, easy, easy.
'Cause I'm not Eazy-E.

1339
01:32:25,682 --> 01:32:27,143
Fucking god.

1340
01:32:27,217 --> 01:32:30,763
Hey. Hey. I need
to go to the store.

1341
01:32:30,834 --> 01:32:31,914
So?

1342
01:32:31,986 --> 01:32:33,327
So I need you
to watch him.

1343
01:32:33,393 --> 01:32:34,954
Fuck, no,
I can't watch him.

1344
01:32:35,026 --> 01:32:37,262
Don't be yelling. There
ain't nothin' to eat.

1345
01:32:38,609 --> 01:32:39,951
Get the fuck
outta here!

1346
01:32:40,017 --> 01:32:41,643
Get the fuck outta here!

1347
01:32:41,713 --> 01:32:44,331
Hit me again with
another one on them rocks.

1348
01:32:46,705 --> 01:32:48,428
What the fuck's that?

1349
01:32:49,744 --> 01:32:52,362
It's my lucky
crack pipe.

1350
01:32:52,431 --> 01:32:54,025
You crazy motherfucker.

1351
01:32:54,096 --> 01:32:56,102
You don't have
a lucky crack pipe?

1352
01:32:56,175 --> 01:32:59,524
No, I don't have a lucky
motherfucking crack pipe.

1353
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:02,218
Then, Donald, you're
gonna take a hit of mine.

1354
01:33:02,287 --> 01:33:04,229
Why I gotta do that?

1355
01:33:04,303 --> 01:33:06,124
'Cause it's lucky.

1356
01:33:08,399 --> 01:33:10,406
Shit.

1357
01:33:10,478 --> 01:33:12,682
Lucky crack pipe.

1358
01:33:21,774 --> 01:33:25,516
Sorry we're late, fellas. I
hope you didn't wait dinner.

1359
01:33:25,581 --> 01:33:27,272
Who the fuck are you?

1360
01:33:27,341 --> 01:33:29,228
Third party beneficiary.

1361
01:33:29,293 --> 01:33:31,563
Your friend here can fill
you in on the details.

1362
01:33:31,630 --> 01:33:34,445
I'm working on getting your money,
Dave. That's what I'm doing here.

1363
01:33:34,510 --> 01:33:37,575
I don't know about you, but the
hardest part of collecting debts

1364
01:33:37,644 --> 01:33:39,335
is having to listen
to the stories.

1365
01:33:39,405 --> 01:33:40,811
Terence owes you
some money?

1366
01:33:40,877 --> 01:33:43,844
$50,000. Plus my two
young friends here

1367
01:33:43,916 --> 01:33:46,850
were supposed to have a sexual
experience of their choosing

1368
01:33:46,924 --> 01:33:51,114
with an attractive woman. Nothing.
He came across with none of it.

1369
01:33:51,180 --> 01:33:55,304
That's wrong. That's wrong you don't do
what you say you're gonna do, Terence.

1370
01:33:55,372 --> 01:33:57,379
The dope's worth
more than 50,000.

1371
01:33:58,604 --> 01:34:00,098
Take it.

1372
01:34:00,172 --> 01:34:02,757
Why don't I take
all the dope?

1373
01:34:02,827 --> 01:34:05,674
Why are you gonna take
what belongs to me?

1374
01:34:05,738 --> 01:34:08,008
Well, there was a time
when I wouldn't have.

1375
01:34:08,075 --> 01:34:11,041
I would've taken what was mine
and left the rest on the table.

1376
01:34:11,115 --> 01:34:13,984
But, you see, I never
got rich enough to retire.

1377
01:34:14,059 --> 01:34:17,604
I'm stuck
doing this shit.

1378
01:34:17,674 --> 01:34:19,746
And I'm not
young anymore.

1379
01:34:21,034 --> 01:34:23,751
So now I don't leave
nothing on the table.

1380
01:34:23,818 --> 01:34:25,444
Pick it up.

1381
01:34:50,696 --> 01:34:52,158
Shoot him again.

1382
01:34:52,232 --> 01:34:53,606
What for?

1383
01:34:53,671 --> 01:34:55,777
His soul's still dancing.

1384
01:35:18,534 --> 01:35:19,941
Shoot him again.

1385
01:35:50,179 --> 01:35:51,838
Good night, Lieutenant.

1386
01:35:54,499 --> 01:35:55,841
What are you
doing tonight?

1387
01:35:55,907 --> 01:35:57,663
I'm getting outta
here and go to bed.

1388
01:35:57,731 --> 01:36:00,862
Just for fun, why don't you stop
by the apartment on Josephine?

1389
01:36:00,930 --> 01:36:02,272
For fun?

1390
01:36:02,339 --> 01:36:04,248
You might find something
interesting there.

1391
01:36:04,322 --> 01:36:05,980
Like what?

1392
01:36:06,050 --> 01:36:09,345
These bushwhackers might've hit a
crack pipe while they were there.

1393
01:36:09,410 --> 01:36:13,753
You know? The off chance that he dropped
it under the bed where the kids were.

1394
01:36:13,825 --> 01:36:15,352
And we missed it.

1395
01:36:15,426 --> 01:36:18,143
The DNA'd place
them at the scene.

1396
01:36:19,841 --> 01:36:21,564
You had a vision, right?

1397
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:26,229
Deoxyribonucleic acid.

1398
01:37:03,326 --> 01:37:05,693
Frankie? Frankie.

1399
01:37:08,317 --> 01:37:10,293
Where's Frankie?
She's not in the house?

1400
01:37:10,366 --> 01:37:12,275
Frankie's on her
way to rehab.

1401
01:37:12,350 --> 01:37:13,975
Rehab?

1402
01:37:14,044 --> 01:37:16,662
What about her clothes?

1403
01:37:16,733 --> 01:37:19,384
Someone will
bring her her clothes.

1404
01:37:21,020 --> 01:37:23,387
Anything else
you wanna know?

1405
01:37:48,858 --> 01:37:51,095
You don't have
to hide it from me.

1406
01:37:52,091 --> 01:37:55,254
We're birds
of a feather.

1407
01:37:55,322 --> 01:37:57,907
We both like
our poison.

1408
01:37:59,577 --> 01:38:02,163
You just drink
beer, I thought.

1409
01:38:48,055 --> 01:38:51,022
Do you mind if
I watch the game?

1410
01:38:51,094 --> 01:38:53,777
Mh-mh. Be my guest.

1411
01:39:02,869 --> 01:39:07,473
I cannot believe
what I'm witnessing.

1412
01:39:07,541 --> 01:39:10,410
Louisiana up by 18 points
in the second quarter.

1413
01:39:10,485 --> 01:39:12,078
For another score.

1414
01:39:12,149 --> 01:39:13,741
You wanna share?

1415
01:39:13,812 --> 01:39:16,530
Back to pass.
He scrambles.

1416
01:39:16,597 --> 01:39:18,833
Hobbs builds his
way to another-

1417
01:39:18,900 --> 01:39:21,289
I don't know.

1418
01:39:22,867 --> 01:39:26,031
And all this without
Renaldo Hayes.

1419
01:39:27,475 --> 01:39:29,614
We still don't know
the nature of his injury.

1420
01:39:29,683 --> 01:39:31,625
Just that he's taken
himself out of the line.

1421
01:39:31,699 --> 01:39:33,554
I'll kill him.

1422
01:39:33,619 --> 01:39:36,914
Renaldo Hayes being out, the
freshman Johnson has really stepped up

1423
01:39:36,978 --> 01:39:40,044
for this football team. You're
in the land of miracles, my boy.

1424
01:39:40,114 --> 01:39:42,831
I'm looking right there at
Hayes, and I'll tell you what.

1425
01:39:42,898 --> 01:39:47,022
The guy just does not look like
a happy guy. He's on the sideline.

1426
01:39:47,058 --> 01:39:49,579
He's obviously suffering
from some sort of injury.

1427
01:40:29,775 --> 01:40:30,985
Hey, guys.

1428
01:40:31,055 --> 01:40:33,062
Good to see you.

1429
01:40:33,135 --> 01:40:34,345
Listen.

1430
01:40:35,503 --> 01:40:37,991
First off, this
thing between us,

1431
01:40:38,063 --> 01:40:41,378
it's gotten way out of
hand. Got way outta hand.

1432
01:40:41,454 --> 01:40:43,145
Okay?

1433
01:40:43,214 --> 01:40:46,509
Those gumbos, couple
of fucking assholes.

1434
01:40:46,574 --> 01:40:49,771
They disappeared because of
something you did to them.

1435
01:40:49,837 --> 01:40:53,547
Whoa, man, I got no
beef with you whatsoever.

1436
01:40:53,613 --> 01:40:56,482
Everything between you and
me, right as rain.

1437
01:40:56,557 --> 01:40:58,182
And I want
you to know

1438
01:40:58,252 --> 01:41:00,673
that my father got in touch with his guy

1439
01:41:00,748 --> 01:41:02,658
and he told him
whoever it is,

1440
01:41:02,732 --> 01:41:05,547
that complaint has been
withdrawn. Finished.

1441
01:41:05,612 --> 01:41:07,368
Oh, yeah.

1442
01:41:07,437 --> 01:41:09,608
Okay?

1443
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:13,026
Okay.

1444
01:41:14,060 --> 01:41:16,165
Oh, yeah?

1445
01:41:17,804 --> 01:41:19,593
Uh, phew.

1446
01:41:23,148 --> 01:41:24,772
Okay.

1447
01:41:24,842 --> 01:41:26,271
That's the way out.

1448
01:41:26,346 --> 01:41:27,940
Oh, yeah.

1449
01:41:30,762 --> 01:41:32,585
Oh, no. Look, Ned,

1450
01:41:32,651 --> 01:41:35,204
if you'd called first, I
would've saved you the trip.

1451
01:41:35,275 --> 01:41:39,365
I'm guessing that you
didn't see the game.

1452
01:41:41,994 --> 01:41:43,782
How did this happen?

1453
01:41:43,849 --> 01:41:47,111
Louisiana by three.

1454
01:41:47,177 --> 01:41:49,249
Hayes ended up playing?

1455
01:41:49,321 --> 01:41:50,663
Nope.

1456
01:41:51,881 --> 01:41:53,091
Worked out anyway.

1457
01:41:53,162 --> 01:41:54,623
What are you
talking about?

1458
01:41:54,697 --> 01:41:55,907
Nothing.

1459
01:41:55,976 --> 01:41:57,504
Oh,

1460
01:41:57,577 --> 01:42:00,576
and my daughter's
tickets, speeding tickets,

1461
01:42:00,647 --> 01:42:02,917
thank you, thank you, thank you.

1462
01:42:02,984 --> 01:42:05,504
This female highway
patrol officer calls up,

1463
01:42:05,576 --> 01:42:07,463
says they're
taken care of.

1464
01:42:10,151 --> 01:42:12,322
It's $10,000. Sure you
don't wanna count it?

1465
01:42:12,392 --> 01:42:13,820
I trust you.

1466
01:42:13,895 --> 01:42:15,902
All right, man. You
take care or yourself.

1467
01:42:15,975 --> 01:42:17,055
All right.

1468
01:42:19,111 --> 01:42:20,671
Great news.

1469
01:42:20,743 --> 01:42:23,645
Our man came up with this at
the crime scene on Josephine.

1470
01:42:23,719 --> 01:42:25,311
I just got lucky.

1471
01:42:25,382 --> 01:42:28,699
The lab found
Godshaw's DNA on it.

1472
01:42:33,349 --> 01:42:35,935
That is fantastic!

1473
01:42:36,006 --> 01:42:37,948
Yes!

1474
01:42:41,253 --> 01:42:42,879
Oh, look at that.

1475
01:43:09,380 --> 01:43:11,234
I found the spoon.

1476
01:43:13,987 --> 01:43:15,580
It's not silver.

1477
01:43:16,867 --> 01:43:19,005
It went rusty.

1478
01:43:19,074 --> 01:43:21,016
I wanna give it to you.

1479
01:43:22,786 --> 01:43:24,477
It's yours.

1480
01:43:25,538 --> 01:43:27,163
It's for me?

1481
01:43:33,954 --> 01:43:35,993
That's so sweet.

1482
01:43:47,233 --> 01:43:48,759
It's beautiful.

1483
01:44:00,224 --> 01:44:02,166
Yeah, I need
eight of them.

1484
01:44:02,240 --> 01:44:04,312
Yes, eight.

1485
01:44:04,383 --> 01:44:08,092
Uh-huh. It's
going down, baby.

1486
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:11,388
Yeah, I got some help.
I'm telling you.

1487
01:44:11,454 --> 01:44:14,683
Police Department. Stand up. Keep
your hands where we can see them.

1488
01:44:14,750 --> 01:44:16,344
What the fuck is this?

1489
01:44:16,414 --> 01:44:18,356
We got it.
Check the outside,

1490
01:44:18,430 --> 01:44:21,146
check the backyard, check
upstairs, check his car.

1491
01:44:21,214 --> 01:44:23,766
We got this. It's okay.
Good. We're good. Upstairs.

1492
01:44:23,838 --> 01:44:24,983
Cuff him.

1493
01:44:25,054 --> 01:44:26,680
No.

1494
01:44:28,125 --> 01:44:30,165
No.

1495
01:44:30,237 --> 01:44:31,928
What do you
mean no?

1496
01:44:31,997 --> 01:44:35,030
This is what happens. Before we can
cuff him, he goes for this weapon,

1497
01:44:35,100 --> 01:44:36,988
we shoot this prick
and steal his shit.

1498
01:44:37,053 --> 01:44:39,606
Fuck. Terence, what-
What are we doing?

1499
01:44:39,677 --> 01:44:41,619
I thought we had
our thing going.

1500
01:44:41,692 --> 01:44:45,434
You're wrong, baby. He acts like he
likes you 'cause he likes to get high.

1501
01:44:45,501 --> 01:44:48,500
Huh? That don't mean
he stop bein' the police.

1502
01:44:48,572 --> 01:44:49,816
Cuff him, Stevie.

1503
01:44:49,884 --> 01:44:51,510
No. Can you draw
a line of murder?

1504
01:44:51,580 --> 01:44:53,140
It's interesting
where to wreck its fun.

1505
01:44:53,212 --> 01:44:55,449
I said cuff him, Stevie.

1506
01:44:55,516 --> 01:44:57,752
This is about money.
You want my fucking money?

1507
01:44:57,820 --> 01:45:01,529
You want my fucking money? Take my
money! You won't kill me for this shit.

1508
01:45:01,595 --> 01:45:04,246
Go for it, son.
Go for it.

1509
01:45:04,315 --> 01:45:05,973
Got for it.
Go for it!

1510
01:45:08,091 --> 01:45:09,552
Yeah, yeah.

1511
01:45:11,546 --> 01:45:13,369
Next time.

1512
01:45:13,435 --> 01:45:15,769
Now fucking cuff him.

1513
01:45:19,194 --> 01:45:22,194
I said cuff the
motherfucker, Stevie!

1514
01:45:46,647 --> 01:45:51,187
Ladies and gentlemen, it is an honor to
conclude this year on a positive note.

1515
01:45:51,255 --> 01:45:54,571
In recognition of his
leadership and tenacity

1516
01:45:54,647 --> 01:45:57,517
in the investigation
of the Ndele family murders

1517
01:45:57,592 --> 01:46:01,007
resulting in the successful
apprehension and prosecution

1518
01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:03,567
of the three
individuals responsible,

1519
01:46:03,639 --> 01:46:09,040
I'm proud to include Lieutenant Terence
McDonagh among those being promoted

1520
01:46:09,111 --> 01:46:12,722
to the rank of captain.
Captain McDonagh.

1521
01:46:20,118 --> 01:46:21,460
Woo!

1522
01:46:37,524 --> 01:46:39,662
Excuse me. Would you care for some wine?

1523
01:46:39,732 --> 01:46:42,864
No, thank you. We're all gonna
stick with our sparkling water.

1524
01:46:45,395 --> 01:46:47,816
I would like
to make a toast.

1525
01:46:48,755 --> 01:46:50,795
To the new Captain.

1526
01:46:50,867 --> 01:46:53,136
To new life.

1527
01:46:53,203 --> 01:46:55,407
I'm probably gonna
start to cry right now.

1528
01:46:55,475 --> 01:46:57,515
Oh, that's okay.

1529
01:46:58,771 --> 01:47:00,461
To my new family.

1530
01:47:00,531 --> 01:47:02,156
God bless.

1531
01:47:02,226 --> 01:47:03,655
Here, here.

1532
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:32,074
You still gonna be working on night
shift when I get closer to the due date?

1533
01:47:32,145 --> 01:47:35,243
I'll make sure I'm
not. How is that?

1534
01:47:35,312 --> 01:47:40,068
I could get to the hospital and all,
but I like having you home at night.

1535
01:47:40,144 --> 01:47:42,348
I like it better
that way, too.

1536
01:48:18,029 --> 01:48:19,938
Thank you, darling.

1537
01:48:44,395 --> 01:48:45,737
All right.

1538
01:48:45,803 --> 01:48:47,209
There we go.

1539
01:48:47,275 --> 01:48:48,868
Where are your keys?

1540
01:48:48,938 --> 01:48:50,532
Did I give them to you?

1541
01:48:50,603 --> 01:48:51,912
No, I don't
think you did.

1542
01:48:51,979 --> 01:48:53,255
Stand against the wall.

1543
01:48:53,322 --> 01:48:54,402
What'd we do?

1544
01:48:54,475 --> 01:48:55,882
Hey, stand
against the wall.

1545
01:48:55,946 --> 01:48:57,538
What are you doing?

1546
01:48:57,610 --> 01:49:00,610
The two of you match a description.
Passing drugs in the club.

1547
01:49:00,682 --> 01:49:04,260
Don't say anything. Do
exactly what I tell you to do.

1548
01:49:04,330 --> 01:49:06,697
So, what are we
high on tonight?

1549
01:49:06,761 --> 01:49:08,038
Nothing.

1550
01:49:08,106 --> 01:49:10,953
Empty your pockets.
Dump out the handbag.

1551
01:49:25,128 --> 01:49:26,787
Room service.

1552
01:49:26,857 --> 01:49:28,995
I didn't order
any room service.

1553
01:49:29,064 --> 01:49:33,188
Oh. It must've been
a mistake again.

1554
01:49:33,256 --> 01:49:35,677
Holy shit.

1555
01:49:35,752 --> 01:49:38,468
I'm Evaristo Chavez, man.
You saved my life.

1556
01:49:38,535 --> 01:49:41,153
I was in the prison
that was flooding.

1557
01:49:41,223 --> 01:49:42,303
Oh, yeah.

1558
01:49:42,374 --> 01:49:43,716
Do you remember me?

1559
01:49:43,783 --> 01:49:46,052
Are you still with
the Police Department?

Port of call
still New Orleans.

1561
01:49:50,503 --> 01:49:51,779
Okay.

1562
01:49:51,846 --> 01:49:53,756

November 14th
I have a year clean.

1565
01:50:00,550 --> 01:50:02,590
Congratulations.

1566
01:50:07,493 --> 01:50:09,697
Are you all right?

1567
01:50:11,172 --> 01:50:14,172
Sometimes I
have bad days.

1568
01:50:16,805 --> 01:50:18,429
Listen,

1569
01:50:18,500 --> 01:50:20,256
you saved my life.

1570
01:50:20,324 --> 01:50:24,634
I'm almost done working. I'm
gonna get you out of here, okay?

1571
01:50:24,709 --> 01:50:26,334
Okay?

1572
01:50:29,572 --> 01:50:32,157
Do fish have dreams?

1573
01:50:51,778 --> 01:50:53,883
You know, Chavez,

1574
01:50:53,954 --> 01:50:57,249
I still hate that I ruined
my underwear for you.
