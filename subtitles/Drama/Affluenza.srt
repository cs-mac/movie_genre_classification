- Do you ever wake and bake?
I used to love getting stoned in
the morning.

- They know I smoke.

I know they smoke. [ Chuckles ]

651

We never talk about it, though.

652
00:29:08,875 --> 00:29:10,417
I think my mom really likes
smoking.

653

- Mm.

654
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:14,875

stoned so he could have sex with
a woman.

- [ Chuckles ]
Thought you two hated each
other.

Definitely not.

I don't think so. [ Blows ]

She's pretty involved with her
boyfriends.

Did you see the credit-card bill
this month?

680

We need to talk about Mary's
salary, and when you sober up --

681
00:30:08,166 --> 00:30:10,959
- Phil, let's not do this right
now.

Are we gonna have this

Who keeps this house nice for
you 365 days of the year?

You don't think that's work?

690
00:30:32,834 --> 00:30:34,792
I'm sorry, Fisher. I'm sorry.

691
00:30:34,792 --> 00:30:36,583
- That's okay.

692

- I t's that promise that's
always set this country apart,

693

that through hard work and
sacrifice, each of us can
pursue our individual dreams

but still come together as one
American family to ensure...

- . ..That the next generation
can pursue their dreams, as
well.

That's why I stand here
tonight...

- You're, uh, practically
naked.
[ Chuckles ]

- Does that make you
uncomfortable?

- W e meet at one of those
defining moments...

- . ..Our economy is in
turmoil...

- She blew Todd on their first
date.

- That's my little cousin.

blow you yet?
