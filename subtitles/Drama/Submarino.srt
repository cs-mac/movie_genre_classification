1
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,822
Yes, you are such a big boy.

2
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,629
You are sweet.
Yes...

3
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,986
We can only get money for these two.

4
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,500
It isn't enough.
Just leave them.

5
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,026
Let's go.

6
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,539
There... there.

7
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:53,743
Do you know where mom has gone?
Do you know?

8
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,026
Come over here.

9
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,620
Did you miss us?
We have been in school.

10
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:24,266
He should be named something.
I run a finger down the page -

11
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,104
- Then you say stop.
And it's not allowed to peek.

12
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:39,146
- Are you going to say stop or what?
- Stop... What does it say?

13
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,746
Ulla.

14
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:49,944
He can't be named that.
You don't want to be named, do you?

15
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,226
Jette Kæp.

16
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:02,182
Heide.
Mette Helming.

17
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:06,065
- But he's a boy.
- Let's try again.

18
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:10,907
- Say stop, goddammit.
- Okay, stop.

19
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,379
This is a good name.

20
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,584
Look here.

21
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:25,548
- That's very good.
- We'll take it.

22
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,946
In the Father -

23
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,108
And the Holy Spirit's... spirit.

24
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,347
- You say that?
- Yes, now keep your mouth shut.

25
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,429
We'll do it right.
Like in a church.

26
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,739
Where is...

27
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,549
Where is my vermouth?

28
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:39,144
You have taken it, right?
You also took my fags, right?

29
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,747
Nick, give me my vermouth.

30
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,510
You drank it all.

31
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,779
- What?
- You drank it all.

32
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,901
Look, she pissed on the floor again.

33
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,186
She is so disgusting.

34
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,100
Nick?

35
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:18,781
- Do you think he is sick?
- No, he just needs sleep.

36
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:13,624
Do you want some food?
I've made something for you.

37
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,866
Are you sleeping?

38
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,786
Wake up... Wake up.

39
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:40,147
Wake up.
Wake up, dammit.

40
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,148
Wake up.
Wake up!

41
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,420
No!

42
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,827
No!

43
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:52,260
No!

44
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,621
Hi, Nick.

45
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,618
<i>Nick, it's Sophie..</i>

46
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:32,061
<i>I made coffee.</i>

47
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,101
<i>Nick...</i>

48
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:41,188
What the fuck...

49
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:45,510
- What is it?
- Just get in here.

50
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:49,828
He had spiky hair.

51
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:53,181
He was so sweet.
I want a lot of children.

52
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:56,905
You can't even look
after the one you have.

53
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:02,626
- Relax. Of course I can.
- Do you ever see him?

54
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:20,378
Relax. You don't need to be
so angry all the time.

55
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,990
- Don't you need a haircut?
- Knock it off.

56
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:31,144
Do you want me to get you to relax?

57
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:30,628
Don't you want to lie down?
You can lie here.

58
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:35,028
- You are welcome to sleep here.
- No thank you.

59
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:41,145
- You never want to sleep here.
- See you.

60
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:18,146
<i>- Hello.
- Hide and seek</i>

61
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:24,425
<i>- Hello...
- Who is it?</i>

62
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:30,985
<i>Hello?</i>

63
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:51,304
- No, not you again. What do you want?
- You are noisy.

64
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:55,025
You've stayed at this hostel
for five months, right?

65
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:59,781
- So what?
- We are nice to each other here.

66
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:04,063
- I am asking you something very simple.
- You do not ask me anything.

67
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,226
Goodbye. Huttelihut.

68
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:12,666
I have asked you to turn down,
so I can sleep.

69
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:16,385
- Right?
- Yes.

70
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:21,266
Turn off the radio, and do not
trample around as if you own the place.

71
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:29,785
<i>It's Sofie.</i>

72
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:42,549
- What happened to your hand?
- Get out.

73
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:47,145
Leave me alone.
Do you understand?

74
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:24,382
Hey... Hey, Nick.

75
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:28,263
Come here.

76
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:36,747
- Ivan?
- Please help me.

77
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:46,068
Damn, man.

78
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,386
What happened?

79
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:53,664
I just looked at their car.
And accidentally touched it.

80
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:58,466
And then they totally freaked out.
Fuck, it hurts, man.

81
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:06,787
Shall I come and look
at your car again, huh?

82
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:11,780
Are you an idiot or what? You can get
some more, if you want, man!

83
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:16,461
Listen...
Do you want more beatings?

84
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:19,821
- No thanks.
- Then shut up.

85
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:25,468
What happened to you, man?

86
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:29,458
Have you become
a punching bag, or what?

87
00:19:30,270 --> 00:19:34,422
- You collect bottles?
- This is my bag!

88
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:39,585
What the hell are you doing, man?
Come on, let's kill them!

89
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,548
Ivan, they are gone.

90
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:48,022
What the hell are you doing? Let's kill them.
Come on Nick, let's kill them.

91
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,828
I'll kill you!
Stop them!

92
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:56,546
I was at this hospital in Hvidovre.
They didn't understand a damn thing, man.

93
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:00,584
- They just gave me pills.
- Pills for what?.

94
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:05,147
It was like,
I have not seen my father for ten years.

95
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:09,138
He is still in Serbia.
I've been waiting for him.

96
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,626
So I tell them:
"Don't talk about my father. "

97
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:17,108
Then everything goes wrong, man.
And then they threw me out.

98
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,864
- What about your mother?
- My mother?

99
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:25,828
My mother died.

100
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:28,788
We buried her
three weeks ago.

101
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:35,068
Was your brother there?

102
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,864
Yes, of course.

103
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,107
I thought you were in jail.

104
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:45,667
- Were you released, or...?
- Of course I was released.

105
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:50,828
- Okay.
- I came out three months ago.

106
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,986
Have you seen my sister?

107
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,499
No.

108
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,980
What were you in for?
What happened?

109
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:05,307
- I don't remember.
- You don't want to remember.

110
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:10,300
My sister threw you out, and for a whole
week you went berserk. You beat up someone.

111
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:13,980
- Eat, I have to go.
- Calm down, Nick.

112
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:25,621
Want to hear something weird?

113
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:29,379
I couldn't taste salt
for a whole week.

114
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:34,503
No matter what.
I drank a lot.

115
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:40,506
Then there was this guy.
A complete random. I knocked him down.

116
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:43,178
Hard.

117
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:49,268
Do you still have that A?

118
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,620
Ana.

119
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:00,460
She doesn't want to see me anymore.
My own sister.

120
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:03,980
- Why not?
- It's a little blurry...

121
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:07,148
Sometimes I get so...

122
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:11,542
What do you mean it's blurry?

123
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:15,186
She was asleep at my mother's home.

124
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:21,306
So I though I'd lay down beside
her. Like when we were kids, right?

125
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:26,300
And then I...
You know...

126
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:30,941
- Fuck it.
- Did you touch her?

127
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,902
No...

128
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:37,026
I didn't mean to.

129
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,461
- That's sick, Ivan.
- I know.

130
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:45,903
I think about it all the time.

131
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:49,989
- Have you ever had sex with a girl?
- I have fucked many.

132
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:59,066
Not really. I get sad,
when you talk about that.

133
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:02,182
I'm sorry.

134
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:06,065
I try to think of something else.
So don't start it.

135
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:11,185
I try to think about cars. I look
at cars to think about anything else.

136
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:15,621
Some big, wet tits -

137
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:18,549
And a butt that rubs my belly.

138
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:22,459
- And sperm on her face.
- Okay, fine.

139
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:26,583
I get mad. I also think
about things that aren't normal.

140
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:29,862
Ivan, calm down. I get it.

141
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:39,618
- Now, don't start crying, alright?
- I don't.

142
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:49,859
I've missed you like crazy, Nick.

143
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:56,619
You were like a big brother to me.

144
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:01,987
- How long has it been? Two years?
- I have no idea.

145
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,307
- I think it's two years ago.
- Is it?

146
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,183
Come here, Nick. I've missed you.

147
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:12,224
You should sit in my kitchen
with my sister, eating crackers.

148
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:16,423
- Do you remember?
- Yes...

149
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,586
I know what we need to do.

150
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:23,545
- Good evening. Welcome.
- Thanks.

151
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:27,709
My friend Ivan needs
a suck 'n fuck.

152
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:57,941
Sorry. Sorry...

153
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:03,905
I bought a sweater for you. Hey, Ivan.

154
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:08,305
Put it on.

155
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:16,108
I followed a girl once.

156
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:23,066
I wasn't going to do anything to her, Nick.

157
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:30,149
Ivan. What then?

158
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:33,660
I just followed her.

159
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:42,423
So she went into this building, and I
slipped in before the door closed.

160
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:49,985
I just wanted to walk past her.

161
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:53,865
Past her hair.
Just smell her, you know.

162
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:59,098
Just when I'm about to pass by her,
she turns around and looks at me.

163
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:03,098
Then she begins to scream and scream -

164
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,585
And I can't handle it.

165
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:08,862
So she got one on the head, man.

166
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:12,824
And then I run down the stairs. Away.

167
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,863
I wasn't going to do anything to her, Nick.

168
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,867
I just wanted to...

169
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:20,146
...sense her.

170
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:25,987
- What's up?
- He's staring at my lady's ass.

171
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:29,865
- You are drooling over her, man.
- If she didn't want people to look, then...

172
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:34,382
- Then what?
- Then she wouldn't act that way.

173
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:39,618
- Mind your own business, cheese doodle!
- She's standing there with that ass...

174
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,627
What are you playing at, man?

175
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:43,940
No, stop!

176
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:48,348
- Let's go.
- What are you doing, man!?

177
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:51,780
Idiots!

178
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:06,987
What the hell is going on, man?

179
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:10,546
- What's happening?
- It's not me. It's Sophie.

180
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:13,787
Because according to child psychologists
at the municipality -

181
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:17,699
- it is important that children have contact
with their biological mother.

182
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:23,742
Bent!
Put your shoes on, dammit.

183
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:28,501
You can wear shoes,
just don't to stomp around.

184
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:40,985
- Hey, what's going on here?
- Hey, Nick.

185
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:47,627
This is my son.
This is Nick.

186
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:52,346
- Say your name.
- I don't want to.

187
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:55,940
Well, his name is Tobias.

188
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,500
How did you get hold of him?

189
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:39,104
Mom, I'm hungry.

190
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:42,859
We'll leave soon. Then you'll get some food.
Just play some more.

191
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:53,382
- Is dad coming soon?
- No, he comes little later.

192
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:57,103
I'm leaving. See you.

193
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:00,341
Bye.

194
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:09,423
<i>- Who is it?
- It's me.</i>

195
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:14,902
- What is it?
- Can you help us?

196
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:19,103
- With what?
- Can he stay with you for two minutes?

197
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:23,861
There has been a misunderstanding.
The police are here.

198
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,828
- And?
- I'll come back. It's just two minutes.

199
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:37,898
Sit down.

200
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:42,547
Here is a little messy, but...

201
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:02,143
Did she just pick you up or..?

202
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:05,979
<i>No, he's not.</i>

203
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:09,580
Just take it easy.
It'll be over soon.

204
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:14,625
<i>I don't know.
He is in kindergarten, I assume.</i>

205
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:18,220
Do you want to go home to your father?

206
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:42,787
I can walk by myself.

207
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:50,903
Hi. This is Tobias.
I think it's him, you guys are looking for.

208
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:53,578
Come, we'll go in here, darling.

209
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,861
<i>You know what...?</i>

210
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:04,746
<i>Stop it
That hurt!</i>

211
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:07,066
<i>Let go of him. Now!</i>

212
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:11,343
<i>Do you hear? Release him!</i>

213
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:31,620
<i>You have dialed -</i>

214
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:37,985
<i>23520144</i>

215
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:40,579
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

216
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:44,669
Hi, this is your big brother.
I would like to get hold of you.

217
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:17,582
Hi, Nick.

218
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:26,344
Are you drunk?

219
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:45,743
Haven't you slept yet?

220
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:06,179
Are you sleeping?

221
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,306
Yes.

222
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:58,340
- Explain to me again what we are doing.
- I want you to see her, Nick.

223
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:07,303
Whose car is it?

224
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:12,745
- If it's another girl you've followed...
- Calm down. Wait and see.

225
00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:38,026
It's Ana.

226
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,226
It's her birthday.

227
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:35,020
Ana took a pregnancy test -

228
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:39,703
and it was positive.

229
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:47,419
I said I wanted to have it.

230
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:52,539
But that was apparently
the wrong thing to say -

231
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:57,301
- Because she left me.
She got an abortion. That was it.

232
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:00,468
Fuck, that's a long time ago.

233
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:04,028
Do you want to have children?

234
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:10,540
With her I wanted everything, man.

235
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:19,101
I think you would be good
at taking care of a baby.

236
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:25,626
Here you go. Thank you.

237
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:56,100
Then she took a magazine
and began beating her.

238
00:38:56,310 --> 00:39:00,269
- Then she ran out.
- That's so far out!

239
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:03,906
She didn't come back out, but...

240
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:08,023
She was just little fatty.

241
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:11,984
- So you were glad?
- Yes.

242
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:15,899
Do you think I'm cute?

243
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:23,500
Just tell me if there is anything
you want me to do.

244
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:32,101
- Want to touch my breasts?
- Yes. Should I just...?

245
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:35,347
Yes. Let me help you.

246
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:41,819
Do you want me to help you?

247
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:45,983
Have you never tried it before, Ivan?

248
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:49,506
It's okay.

249
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:52,468
It's pretty sweet.

250
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:56,269
You can touch further down, as well.

251
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:00,902
- Can you tell that I'm wet?
- Yes.

252
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:06,983
I'll leave for 10 minutes.

253
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:33,180
Hello. I want
my brother's address.

254
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:36,460
I have a phone number.

255
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:27,664
Who are you?

256
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:31,021
I'm looking for my brother.
He lives here.

257
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:35,348
There's no one home. He hasn't
been home for a few weeks.

258
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:39,819
I hope nothing happened.

259
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:44,982
He was so sweet, your brother.
And that sweet little Martin.

260
00:41:54,310 --> 00:41:57,905
- Is something wrong?
- No, no, I...

261
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:06,107
I've never seen where he lives.

262
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:11,907
I've removed the ads. So no one
can tell that he isn't home.

263
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:17,060
If you see him,
tell him to call me.

264
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:20,740
- If he shows up, okay?
- Okay.

265
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:23,821
Thanks.

266
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:36,425
Ivan!

267
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:40,188
Hi, Nick.

268
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:46,020
- What are you doing?
- Nick?

269
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:49,825
You must stay out here.

270
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:54,262
It's not so good in there.

271
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:58,706
What the hell are you talking about?

272
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:02,218
Stop... No, stop, Nick!

273
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,786
What's going on?

274
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:13,945
- Ivan!
- It was just because...

275
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:18,541
Suddenly she began to scream.
I wanted her to stop.

276
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:22,306
Ivan!

277
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:51,186
I can't do this anymore.

278
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:16,062
- Hey, honey.
- Hi, Dad.

279
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:25,429
What are you drawing?

280
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:28,906
Me and mom.
And me in a Zorro costume.

281
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:37,219
- Are you ready to go home?
- Two seconds.

282
00:46:37,430 --> 00:46:39,625
Now.

283
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:51,219
- Did we forget lunch again?
- Yes.

284
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:53,381
Sorry.

285
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:59,499
- Then let's go buy some food, okay?
- Yea.

286
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:04,829
Dad, I want toast.

287
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:10,502
Okay, toast.
But something healthy, too, okay?

288
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:13,861
- Do you want to steer the cart?
- Yes.

289
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:21,704
Here's flour and browning.

290
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:25,539
- Is there anything else you need?
- No thanks.

291
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:30,540
- I owe you.
- It doesn't matter. Keep it.

292
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:40,345
- Are you doing your homework?
- No, I am drawing.

293
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:45,419
- I'm still in kindergarten.
- Oh yes.

294
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:49,384
Can you look after him a bit?
I have to go to the toilet.

295
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:52,821
Thanks for the information.

296
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:56,744
You are good at that.

297
00:47:56,950 --> 00:48:01,785
<i>More colors.
Then it would be really good.</i>

298
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:04,424
<i>What about a green</i>

299
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:08,066
<i>Yes, and what about a man there?</i>

300
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:11,182
<i>Now you just watch.</i>

301
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:16,266
That doesn't look like a space rocket.

302
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:24,708
- It took a while.
- Yes, okay. Want some food?

303
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:27,708
No thanks. I'm leaving.

304
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:33,620
- Thanks for the help, Vørle.
- Okay.

305
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:50,699
They say that you pick him up too late,
and he seems tired and aggressive.

306
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:55,188
He doesn't sleeps well at the moment.
He is thinking of his mother.

307
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:59,019
Martin's mother was run over
two years ago.

308
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:02,700
Both you and Martin's mother
were substance abusers?

309
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:08,303
- Have you started taking drugs again?
- No, not at all.

310
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:13,982
- You don't seem to feel good.
- Oh... Okay.

311
00:49:15,630 --> 00:49:20,181
- I think it's the flu...
- I don't think you understand the seriousness.

312
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:24,019
We have begun a process -

313
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:27,825
- Which may end with
a placement of your boy.

314
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:32,467
It will be assessed if you are
able to take care of him.

315
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,744
Okay.

316
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:42,300
- Shall we say that's it?
- Yes.

317
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:45,104
And regarding cash assistance...

318
00:49:45,310 --> 00:49:49,861
Just forget it.
It's okay.

319
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:53,380
You can get three days' advance.

320
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:06,025
Just one more thing.

321
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:14,418
I don't care about anything else
other than my boy, okay?

322
00:50:20,030 --> 00:50:22,908
- Dad, I'm hungry.
- Okay.

323
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:33,827
Sit straight and watch a little television, okay?
Dad has to go to the toilet.

324
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:37,261
I want something to eat now, Dad.

325
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:43,462
Okay, I'll make you something.

326
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:50,784
It's okay.
Just go to the bathroom.

327
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:57,580
Okay. Sit here.
Take off your jacket.

328
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:03,700
I'll be back in a minute.

329
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:05,229
Okay.

330
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:31,507
Come here.
Let's sleep in daddy's bed.

331
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:42,664
You can't lie on the floor, okay?

332
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:03,629
Come, Martin.

333
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:07,150
- What is it?
- Come.

334
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:10,780
Yes, okay.
What?

335
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:16,229
- Look... Zorro.
- Yes!

336
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:18,944
Good, huh?

337
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:29,785
Fuck!

338
00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:40,780
Hello?

339
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:47,182
Who?
Yes, that's my mother.

340
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:49,381
How is she?

341
00:54:54,270 --> 00:54:56,306
Okay...

342
00:54:57,270 --> 00:54:59,625
Okay.

343
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:04,941
What time did she die?

344
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:12,345
Yes, try.

345
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:16,543
I don't know how to get hold of him
but you can try.

346
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:22,149
Yes. Yes, fine.

347
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:24,784
You're welcome.

348
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:37,741
- Honey, you'll have to go in by yourself.
- What are you doing?

349
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:40,180
Dad is busy. Go now.

350
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:43,826
- You're picking me up, right?
- Of course I'll pick you up you.

351
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:47,545
I always pick you up.
Now go.

352
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:53,946
Martin, take this.

353
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:57,858
Here.

354
00:56:14,390 --> 00:56:16,346
<i>Yes.</i>

355
00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:44,462
Martin, your father is here.

356
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:46,740
Hi, Dad.

357
00:56:48,270 --> 00:56:51,228
I'll go find Martin's clothes.

358
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:55,587
- It is a drawing for grandma's coffin.
- Come.

359
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,866
Look at it.

360
00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:03,139
Come on, Martin.

361
00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:06,626
Martin, here are your clothes.

362
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:18,107
I can do it myself.

363
00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:33,586
Dad.

364
00:57:40,270 --> 00:57:42,659
Dad, are you asleep?

365
00:57:47,870 --> 00:57:52,421
I think it's time for kindergarten now.

366
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:56,100
Of course.

367
00:57:58,230 --> 00:58:01,620
What time is it?
Oh no.

368
00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:06,588
I'm coming.

369
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:11,781
We'll probably a little late, Martin.

370
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:16,142
- Do you want breakfast?
- Yes.

371
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:21,865
I don't know, Martin...

372
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:25,585
It's okay. But I would
like a lunch pack.

373
00:58:27,030 --> 00:58:31,865
You'll get one tomorrow. You can
eat some from Hjalte's again.

374
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:35,346
- No.
- Yes.

375
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:37,626
- Yes, Martin.
- No!

376
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:40,384
No, I won't eat his food!

377
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:43,866
- You fucking have to!
- No! I don't want to anymore!

378
00:58:44,070 --> 00:58:46,026
Martin...

379
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:49,381
Come on. Come here.
Calm down now.

380
00:58:49,590 --> 00:58:53,868
- Let me go! Stop!
- Come here.

381
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:57,346
- Stop.
- Calm down. Easy.

382
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:01,544
Come on.
Come here.

383
00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:09,665
I know.
I know.

384
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:15,503
I know.
I know, sweetheart.

385
00:59:15,710 --> 00:59:18,986
I'll think of something, okay?

386
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:23,468
<i>- Hello.
- It's home help.</i>

387
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:27,299
<i>It's not the day,
for my home help.</i>

388
00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:32,139
Lizzy Holm?
Then it's today.

389
00:59:33,390 --> 00:59:37,542
Hello. I'm about to make lunch.
Want some food?

390
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:39,866
No thanks.

391
00:59:41,470 --> 00:59:45,019
Are not you hungry?
Do you want some to go?

392
00:59:48,510 --> 00:59:51,070
What are you doing?

393
00:59:51,270 --> 00:59:54,467
- You are insured.
- You can't take my stuff.

394
00:59:56,750 --> 01:00:00,186
Do not take my wedding rings!

395
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:05,587
- Where is your money?
- I have no money. I have none.

396
01:00:05,790 --> 01:00:08,827
- Where is your money?
- I have no money.

397
01:00:09,030 --> 01:00:12,500
Tell me where the money is
Otherwise I'll break your legs -

398
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:15,099
and leave you.

399
01:00:27,310 --> 01:00:31,064
Put it there.

400
01:00:40,790 --> 01:00:42,781
Good.

401
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:46,548
- Hey, Nick.
- Hello.

402
01:00:49,590 --> 01:00:52,980
It's my older brother, Nick.

403
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:55,784
Can't you say hello?

404
01:00:57,350 --> 01:01:02,504
- Hello. My name is Martin.
- Hi, Martin.

405
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:06,788
I didn't expect to see you.

406
01:01:06,990 --> 01:01:10,187
I didn't want to come, either.

407
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:15,180
But I have some papers.
Can we meet afterwards?

408
01:01:15,390 --> 01:01:17,346
Okay.

409
01:01:46,270 --> 01:01:51,105
- What do you want?
- We'll share a cola.

410
01:01:51,310 --> 01:01:56,464
- I'm buying. What do you want?
- Okay... What do you want?

411
01:01:56,670 --> 01:02:00,504
- A cola.
- A cola and a lemon water.

412
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:05,101
Lemon Water? A cola,
a lemon water and a Tuborg Gold.

413
01:02:05,310 --> 01:02:08,700
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.

414
01:02:10,110 --> 01:02:12,624
Chicken and fries.

415
01:02:14,190 --> 01:02:17,262
- It's good to see you.
- Yes.

416
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:23,263
- Where do you live now?
- Northwest.

417
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:26,584
I don't have your phone number.

418
01:02:26,790 --> 01:02:29,588
I have no phone, so...

419
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:37,218
Mom had a house -

420
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:40,979
And it has become very valuable.

421
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:45,461
- 200.000-300.000.
- 200.000-300.000?

422
01:02:45,670 --> 01:02:48,503
Yes. And that's our money.

423
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:53,464
It's 289,000.

424
01:02:56,630 --> 01:03:00,862
- Thanks.
- You should have my number.

425
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:07,186
Just write it here.

426
01:03:17,790 --> 01:03:20,748
- Here.
- Thanks.

427
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:31,861
Martin, you can go play,
while we wait for the food.

428
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:36,546
Put on your jacket.

429
01:03:47,790 --> 01:03:52,181
You can just keep them.
The money from mom.

430
01:03:53,230 --> 01:03:55,539
I don't want them.

431
01:03:55,750 --> 01:04:00,141
- Why not?
- I want nothing from mom.

432
01:04:02,830 --> 01:04:06,823
- And beer is not that expensive.
- I've got it under control, Nick.

433
01:04:07,030 --> 01:04:11,581
- Fine. I don't want to interfere.
- I've got it under control.

434
01:04:13,790 --> 01:04:18,068
It's not about you.
It's the boy.

435
01:04:19,870 --> 01:04:22,668
Okay?

436
01:04:51,910 --> 01:04:54,788
Where'd he go?

437
01:04:54,950 --> 01:04:57,180
He left.

438
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:03,982
Come, let's go.

439
01:05:04,190 --> 01:05:09,264
Now let's spend some money.
For there will be many more very soon.

440
01:05:09,470 --> 01:05:12,542
- Can you see all those shelves?
- Yes.

441
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:16,026
Go crazy.
What do you want?

442
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:19,461
- Plaice fillet.
- Lettuce. Something healthy.

443
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:24,221
More fish fillet. Juice. And mackerel.

444
01:05:24,430 --> 01:05:29,026
And Risifrutti.
And curied herring.

445
01:05:29,230 --> 01:05:33,428
You want a beating, huh?
You want a beating?

446
01:05:41,790 --> 01:05:44,987
Just put it over there.
Then I take it from here.

447
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:50,708
- That was everything. You just have to sign here.
- Then you'll extract it from my account, right?

448
01:05:50,910 --> 01:05:54,698
Are you afraid of coming over here?
You pussy!

449
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:47,299
We've tried a roller coaster,
The Flying Trunk and the Dragon.

450
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:49,705
What do we have left?

451
01:06:50,870 --> 01:06:52,428
The Demon.

452
01:06:52,590 --> 01:06:57,539
The Demon, yes. And I'll shoot
some bears for you, right?

453
01:06:57,710 --> 01:07:00,702
- Yes.
- Want another coke?

454
01:07:00,870 --> 01:07:03,065
Yes, of course.

455
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:06,023
- Do you have a pen?
- Yes.

456
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:10,860
- I need a beer and a cola.
- Just a minute.

457
01:07:13,150 --> 01:07:15,618
Watch this.

458
01:07:17,030 --> 01:07:19,908
Who am I now?

459
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:24,309
Pierrot?

460
01:07:24,510 --> 01:07:26,978
Pierrot!

461
01:07:31,390 --> 01:07:35,065
- No, you are Zorro!
- Yes, I am Zorro.

462
01:07:35,270 --> 01:07:38,182
Want it?
And another.

463
01:07:39,110 --> 01:07:41,624
There we go.

464
01:07:45,630 --> 01:07:47,700
- Cheers.
- Bottoms up.

465
01:07:47,910 --> 01:07:50,583
Bottoms all the way up!

466
01:07:52,430 --> 01:07:53,863
Right?

467
01:07:57,310 --> 01:07:59,460
Watch this.

468
01:08:03,630 --> 01:08:07,748
If you save this Z...

469
01:08:08,790 --> 01:08:12,669
...and I save this Z
we can always find each other.

470
01:08:13,870 --> 01:08:16,259
Yes.

471
01:09:31,150 --> 01:09:34,108
Dad...

472
01:09:34,310 --> 01:09:37,700
Dad, I can't sleep...

473
01:09:40,790 --> 01:09:43,099
Dad?

474
01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:16,465
Just stay seated.
Be seated.

475
01:11:16,670 --> 01:11:20,379
- You come from the Albanian?
- Yes.

476
01:11:23,030 --> 01:11:25,863
- Is that for me?
- Yes.

477
01:11:47,870 --> 01:11:49,542
Good.

478
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:53,948
He does not come in here today.
He is in a bad mood.

479
01:11:54,150 --> 01:11:58,143
Now I take the money with me to the car.
And if it's are all there -

480
01:11:58,350 --> 01:12:01,103
Then you get what you paid for.

481
01:12:01,310 --> 01:12:04,939
If it's not there,
then we take 50.000 for the inconvenience.

482
01:12:05,150 --> 01:12:08,187
And you get to walk out the door.

483
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:11,746
- And we don't see each other again.
- Can't you just count them here?

484
01:12:11,950 --> 01:12:16,660
Easy. I know
the money is there.

485
01:12:16,870 --> 01:12:22,661
No one's trying to cheat you.

486
01:12:22,870 --> 01:12:28,308
People are just nervous if
there's a lot of money around.

487
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:30,148
It doesn't look good.

488
01:12:30,350 --> 01:12:33,023
And you'll only sell in the city, right?

489
01:12:34,630 --> 01:12:39,420
- You have a little boy?
- Yes.

490
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:42,622
Why are you doing this?

491
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:47,819
- To make some money.
- For your boy?

492
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:51,943
And then you get caught.
What happens then?

493
01:12:53,630 --> 01:12:55,825
I won't get caught.

494
01:13:30,710 --> 01:13:35,181
Elias and Kalle,
don't run on the stairs.

495
01:13:35,390 --> 01:13:37,950
Hi, Martin.

496
01:13:38,150 --> 01:13:40,584
- Is that your father?
- Yes.

497
01:13:40,790 --> 01:13:46,945
- Mona. I am the new intern.
- Hey, Mona.

498
01:13:48,670 --> 01:13:54,063
Nice to meet you. This is the sheet
with participants for our colony.

499
01:13:54,270 --> 01:13:57,979
- Is Martin going?
- To the colony?

500
01:13:58,190 --> 01:14:01,227
We have sent some letters.

501
01:14:01,430 --> 01:14:05,548
- Maybe we sent them to his mother?
- Martin has no mother.

502
01:14:06,910 --> 01:14:11,984
So I usually get the letters.
But I haven't seen them.

503
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:16,103
- She was run over by a road hog.
- I'm sorry.

504
01:14:16,310 --> 01:14:19,507
We are doing very well on our own.
Right, Martin?

505
01:14:22,590 --> 01:14:25,582
- Do you want to go to the colony?
- Yes, if I'm allowed.

506
01:14:25,790 --> 01:14:29,544
Obviously you are going.
Right?

507
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:32,389
Sure, I am!

508
01:14:32,590 --> 01:14:36,503
- Yes, he'll go. He would like that.
- Good.

509
01:14:38,390 --> 01:14:40,665
See you.

510
01:14:40,870 --> 01:14:43,703
Bye, bye.
Bye, Martin.

511
01:14:46,990 --> 01:14:51,188
- Who is it?
- Wait a minute.

512
01:14:52,230 --> 01:14:55,222
- Hello.
- We are going to play hide and seek!

513
01:14:58,190 --> 01:15:00,226
Hello.

514
01:15:00,390 --> 01:15:02,142
Who is it?

515
01:15:05,950 --> 01:15:08,623
Hello?

516
01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:15,261
I don't know.

517
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:20,983
Hi.

518
01:15:21,190 --> 01:15:24,626
Take care of yourself. Be good.
Give me a hug.

519
01:15:30,430 --> 01:15:33,149
Off you go.

520
01:15:34,870 --> 01:15:39,148
Are you excited, Martin?
Me too.

521
01:15:39,350 --> 01:15:44,105
You can look after me.
You can sit next to Malthe.

522
01:15:44,310 --> 01:15:48,462
I'll call you every night
and say goodnight. Bye, Martin.

523
01:15:55,470 --> 01:15:58,223
See you.

524
01:16:35,910 --> 01:16:38,629
- Dope.
- What do you have?

525
01:16:38,830 --> 01:16:43,187
- Very good dope.
- Shut up, what do you have?

526
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:48,066
- White Thai.
- Don't know it. Is it good?

527
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:50,738
Okay. 200.

528
01:16:56,110 --> 01:16:58,783
Come on, man.

529
01:17:08,070 --> 01:17:09,947
The same as yesterday.

530
01:17:54,230 --> 01:17:56,744
Damn.
Stop a minute.

531
01:17:56,950 --> 01:17:59,748
I've 400.
I have 400 for you.

532
01:18:07,310 --> 01:18:09,665
Is it good stuff?

533
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:16,349
You're new here, right?
Take it easy, man.

534
01:18:16,550 --> 01:18:21,260
If it's decent, I'll come
again. The Ghanaians are too insane.

535
01:18:21,470 --> 01:18:24,985
- Okay. See you.
- Yea, fuck off.

536
01:18:32,830 --> 01:18:35,139
- Got dope?
- How much?

537
01:18:53,550 --> 01:18:57,463
You can't stand by Central Station.
They only sell pills there.

538
01:18:57,670 --> 01:19:00,867
You need to go further down the street.
If you want to sell.

539
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:03,868
You really have the goods, man.

540
01:19:04,070 --> 01:19:06,220
Where are you from?

541
01:19:11,430 --> 01:19:13,660
Around.

542
01:19:13,870 --> 01:19:17,499
- Are you nervous?
- What for?

543
01:19:17,710 --> 01:19:22,738
It's not like you hear a click on the phone.
They aren't that stupid.

544
01:19:22,950 --> 01:19:26,022
You get that burning sensation
in the back of your neck -

545
01:19:26,230 --> 01:19:29,779
- When you walk in the street.
That's the one you should listen to.

546
01:19:29,990 --> 01:19:33,187
It is as if someone is
following you.

547
01:19:33,390 --> 01:19:37,508
But you can't feel it
if you are fucking nervous all the time.

548
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:45,058
It's really good dope.
Where does it come from?

549
01:19:45,270 --> 01:19:48,467
You ask too much.
I'm going now.

550
01:19:48,670 --> 01:19:51,628
- Wait a minute.
- I'm leaving.

551
01:19:51,830 --> 01:19:56,506
- If you follow me I'll beat you.
- Relax, man.

552
01:19:56,710 --> 01:20:00,339
I'm an old school teacher, man.
I'm no cop.

553
01:20:00,550 --> 01:20:03,508
You are all worked up.

554
01:20:03,710 --> 01:20:08,067
You need to get someone to sell for you.
You're bad at it.

555
01:20:48,550 --> 01:20:51,462
<i>- He's helping with the cooking.
- Okay.</i>

556
01:20:51,670 --> 01:20:56,186
<i>Martin, your father is on the phone.
Here he comes.</i>

557
01:20:56,390 --> 01:21:00,542
<i>- Hello, darling.
- I found some amber.</i>

558
01:21:00,750 --> 01:21:05,870
<i>- It's white, but it's amber.
- Okay.</i>

559
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:09,858
<i>- We're eating now, Dad.
- Okay...</i>

560
01:21:10,070 --> 01:21:13,426
<i>- You hang up first.
- No, you do.</i>

561
01:21:13,630 --> 01:21:17,782
<i>- Okay, we do it at the same time.
- Okay. I'll count to three.</i>

562
01:21:19,390 --> 01:21:24,418
One, two, three...

563
01:21:37,470 --> 01:21:39,620
Carsten.

564
01:21:39,830 --> 01:21:43,425
- Jimmy says you can sell.
- Yes, yes

565
01:21:43,630 --> 01:21:47,339
- And you're not bullshitting?
- No, I don't bullshit.

566
01:21:47,550 --> 01:21:51,259
If you have good dope,
I can sell a few grams a day.

567
01:21:51,470 --> 01:21:53,745
You cover the losses.

568
01:21:53,950 --> 01:21:57,101
- If you screw me over...
- I don't.

569
01:21:58,870 --> 01:22:01,703
- There are ten packages here.
- Okay.

570
01:22:02,670 --> 01:22:06,265
If it's full of money later,
we have a deal.

571
01:22:06,470 --> 01:22:10,861
- At two o'clock. Not a minute later.
- I'll be on time.

572
01:22:11,830 --> 01:22:14,708
- Get lost.
- Bye, Carsten.

573
01:22:16,190 --> 01:22:20,502
He has been an addict
since he was 14.

574
01:22:20,710 --> 01:22:22,826
He knows the game.

575
01:22:23,030 --> 01:22:27,820
He knows how he to sell,
and where to sell from.

576
01:22:28,030 --> 01:22:29,941
And he's fast.

577
01:22:30,150 --> 01:22:34,666
He'll make you and your son rich
so you can travel around the world.

578
01:22:34,870 --> 01:22:38,260
Dammit, don't you want that?

579
01:22:40,750 --> 01:22:45,346
So say thanks to Old Yellow
instead of being angry.

580
01:22:46,990 --> 01:22:49,868
Yes, yes. Thanks, Yellow.

581
01:22:50,030 --> 01:22:52,339
Thank you. Whatever.

582
01:22:54,470 --> 01:22:56,461
See you.

583
01:22:57,470 --> 01:23:02,225
<i>- Kindergarten, it is Mona.
- Hey, is Martin there?</i>

584
01:23:02,430 --> 01:23:05,786
<i>He is playing soccer -</i>

585
01:23:05,990 --> 01:23:09,585
<i>- So you'll have to talk to me.
That's okay, isn't it?</i>

586
01:23:09,790 --> 01:23:14,944
Fine. You'll remember to teach
Martin how to ride a bike, right?

587
01:23:15,150 --> 01:23:20,349
<i>- What should we teach him?
- How to ride a bicycle.</i>

588
01:23:20,550 --> 01:23:24,941
<i>That's now a problem.
But let's talk a little first.</i>

589
01:23:25,110 --> 01:23:26,623
Okay.

590
01:24:39,070 --> 01:24:41,379
We eat in a minute.

591
01:24:41,590 --> 01:24:45,503
Tomorrow I will teach you to ride a bike.

592
01:24:45,710 --> 01:24:48,508
I don't want to.

593
01:24:48,710 --> 01:24:50,985
I'll fall for sure.

594
01:24:51,190 --> 01:24:55,945
Of course, you want to. I'll take
tomorrow off and teach you.

595
01:24:57,710 --> 01:25:01,703
Mona will also be there.
So she can help you.

596
01:25:01,910 --> 01:25:04,185
Is she your girlfriend?

597
01:25:05,670 --> 01:25:08,184
Mona?

598
01:25:08,350 --> 01:25:11,228
No...
Would it be okay if she were?

599
01:25:12,670 --> 01:25:14,228
I don't know.

600
01:25:14,430 --> 01:25:17,866
You know what?
You start school next summer.

601
01:25:18,070 --> 01:25:23,019
No, I won't.
I will only go to kindergarten.

602
01:25:23,230 --> 01:25:26,666
- Why don't you want go to school?
- I just don't.

603
01:25:26,870 --> 01:25:31,148
You have to go to school some time.
Come here.

604
01:25:33,830 --> 01:25:37,027
Look, it's not dangerous.

605
01:25:37,230 --> 01:25:39,903
And I'll go with you the first day.

606
01:25:43,550 --> 01:25:48,578
I'd rather learn how to ride a bike.
I don't want to go to school without you.

607
01:25:48,790 --> 01:25:51,429
Okay. Off you go.

608
01:25:58,830 --> 01:26:03,585
- I dreamt about mom yesterday.
- What did she say?

609
01:26:03,790 --> 01:26:06,543
Not much.

610
01:26:10,750 --> 01:26:14,584
Do you know where she told me
that we were expecting you?

611
01:26:16,030 --> 01:26:20,148
- At the zoo.
- At the monkeys' cage.

612
01:26:20,350 --> 01:26:22,705
At the monkeys' cage, yes.

613
01:26:26,350 --> 01:26:29,069
I can feel her looking down at us.

614
01:26:31,030 --> 01:26:33,498
And smiles.

615
01:26:33,710 --> 01:26:36,383
I feel it too.

616
01:26:42,310 --> 01:26:44,824
I love you, honey.

617
01:26:48,790 --> 01:26:51,463
I love you.

618
01:26:53,790 --> 01:26:56,748
Money first.
Why do I need to say it.

619
01:26:59,990 --> 01:27:02,584
For 500

620
01:27:08,590 --> 01:27:11,866
<i>- Hello.
- Hey, you old bag.</i>

621
01:27:12,070 --> 01:27:15,585
<i>How is it going up there?
It's crazy down here.</i>

622
01:27:15,790 --> 01:27:18,304
<i>- Should we get a beer afterwards?
- Yes. </ I></i>

623
01:27:18,510 --> 01:27:21,866
<i>- We'll talk in an hour.
- Alright.</i>

624
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:24,345
And Yellow? Thank you.

625
01:27:34,350 --> 01:27:38,104
<i>- Hello.
- Run! Run as fast as you can!</i>

626
01:27:38,310 --> 01:27:41,382
<i>Carsten is a snitch, man.</i>

627
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:44,263
<i>Get rid of everything and run!</i>

628
01:28:57,390 --> 01:29:01,906
Hello. My name is Ulrik Hansen
I am your defence counsellor.

629
01:29:03,270 --> 01:29:07,229
I'm in a hurry,
so we'll have to keep it short.

630
01:29:07,430 --> 01:29:11,139
You haven't told the
police anything yet?

631
01:29:13,830 --> 01:29:16,549
What happened?

632
01:29:19,950 --> 01:29:22,703
You are supposed to have strangled her?

633
01:29:23,910 --> 01:29:25,423
With that?

634
01:29:34,390 --> 01:29:37,348
Is anyone I need to contact for you?

635
01:29:41,990 --> 01:29:44,379
We'll meet again soon, Nikolaj -

636
01:29:44,590 --> 01:29:49,027
- And then we'll have someone
look at that hand.

637
01:30:28,190 --> 01:30:31,500
We're here to talk to you about Martin.

638
01:30:35,550 --> 01:30:38,622
You have been allowed to call him.

639
01:30:41,470 --> 01:30:45,099
He is doing okay
under the circumstances.

640
01:30:45,310 --> 01:30:48,302
I know it can be difficult
to talk to him -

641
01:30:48,510 --> 01:30:52,867
- But it's best for Martin,
if he knows where his father is.

642
01:30:53,070 --> 01:30:55,300
He should know that you're okay.

643
01:30:57,550 --> 01:31:00,826
Do you want to talk to him?

644
01:31:05,470 --> 01:31:07,506
Yes.

645
01:31:10,070 --> 01:31:12,026
Hello.

646
01:31:21,510 --> 01:31:24,661
Martin? It's Dad.

647
01:31:24,870 --> 01:31:28,624
<i>- Hello, darling.
- Hello.</i>

648
01:31:28,830 --> 01:31:31,105
How are you?

649
01:31:32,270 --> 01:31:34,340
<i>- I don't know.
- Where are you?</i>

650
01:31:34,510 --> 01:31:38,742
On a farm.
Dad, when can I see you again?

651
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:40,866
I don't know.

652
01:31:42,350 --> 01:31:45,467
It'll probably take some time.

653
01:31:48,790 --> 01:31:52,499
<i>- Are they treating you well?
- They have rabbits.</i>

654
01:31:52,710 --> 01:31:55,782
Rabbits? Really?

655
01:31:55,990 --> 01:31:58,060
<i>I miss you.</i>

656
01:31:58,230 --> 01:32:01,142
I miss you too, honey.

657
01:32:03,510 --> 01:32:06,070
But it'll be okay.

658
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:11,820
Martin?

659
01:32:13,390 --> 01:32:15,824
Are you there?

660
01:32:19,030 --> 01:32:21,419
Don't cry, honey.

661
01:32:21,590 --> 01:32:23,865
<i>I can't help it.</i>

662
01:32:26,430 --> 01:32:31,060
<i>- Is there anyone who can comfort you?
- Yes, but they are eating.</i>

663
01:32:34,070 --> 01:32:38,063
<i>- Just go and eat, okay?
- Should I just go?</i>

664
01:32:38,270 --> 01:32:41,068
Of course.

665
01:32:43,070 --> 01:32:46,107
I think about you, my big boy.

666
01:32:46,990 --> 01:32:48,821
Bye.

667
01:32:50,310 --> 01:32:54,019
<i>- Are you hanging up?
- No.</i>

668
01:32:55,510 --> 01:32:58,229
<i>- You hang up.
- No, you do.</i>

669
01:32:58,430 --> 01:33:01,581
Okay. I count to three.

670
01:33:01,790 --> 01:33:04,987
Then we'll hang up together, okay?

671
01:33:07,630 --> 01:33:12,306
One, two, three...

672
01:33:12,510 --> 01:33:14,865
Bye.

673
01:34:18,350 --> 01:34:20,341
Hey!

674
01:34:21,750 --> 01:34:24,708
Brother?

675
01:34:41,470 --> 01:34:43,665
Nick!

676
01:34:44,870 --> 01:34:48,783
- You look like shit.
- So do you.

677
01:34:59,310 --> 01:35:03,303
- How long have you been here?
- Three weeks.

678
01:35:05,550 --> 01:35:07,939
Where's Martin?

679
01:35:08,150 --> 01:35:11,381
I don't know where he is.

680
01:35:14,910 --> 01:35:19,347
- I've been thinking about you.
- You too.

681
01:35:19,550 --> 01:35:23,782
I wanted to have a
proper talk with you.

682
01:35:23,990 --> 01:35:27,699
Or just see you more.

683
01:35:29,790 --> 01:35:32,384
I tried to call.

684
01:35:34,870 --> 01:35:38,579
I don't think
it was our fault that time.

685
01:35:38,790 --> 01:35:41,145
You were a good big brother.

686
01:35:43,350 --> 01:35:46,023
You did what you could.

687
01:35:48,430 --> 01:35:50,819
And I did what I could.

688
01:35:52,670 --> 01:35:55,059
What's going on?
Are you alright?

689
01:35:57,550 --> 01:36:00,781
- I get off here, Nick.
- What?

690
01:36:00,990 --> 01:36:03,788
- It's about time.
- What?

691
01:36:03,990 --> 01:36:05,662
What did you say?

692
01:36:05,830 --> 01:36:08,105
Brother?

693
01:36:11,150 --> 01:36:14,745
- Take care of yourself.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute, man.

694
01:36:14,950 --> 01:36:17,862
What happens to Martin?

695
01:36:18,070 --> 01:36:20,743
Brother!
Let me talk to him!

696
01:36:22,550 --> 01:36:24,859
Brother!

697
01:36:26,430 --> 01:36:28,625
Fuck!

698
01:36:28,830 --> 01:36:32,027
Let me outta here!
Let me out!

699
01:36:32,230 --> 01:36:34,186
Hey!

700
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:40,905
Brother!

701
01:37:22,910 --> 01:37:27,938
- Is Nikolaj Torp here?
- Yes, just go inside.

702
01:37:29,230 --> 01:37:34,463
Nikolaj, how are you?
I have some juice for you.

703
01:37:43,150 --> 01:37:45,106
How are you?

704
01:37:47,710 --> 01:37:50,622
I can still feel my hand.

705
01:37:51,990 --> 01:37:55,346
It's all a bit strange.

706
01:37:57,190 --> 01:37:59,784
I don't know what you are doing.

707
01:37:59,990 --> 01:38:05,303
The doctor can testify that your hand was
useless at the time of the murder.

708
01:38:05,510 --> 01:38:08,946
And two hands were definitely used.

709
01:38:11,110 --> 01:38:13,704
I don't know who you're hiding -

710
01:38:13,910 --> 01:38:18,267
- But you shouldn't take the blame
for a crime you did not commit.

711
01:38:24,150 --> 01:38:26,345
Is there anything you need?

712
01:38:26,510 --> 01:38:29,263
Yes, I would like to see my brother.

713
01:38:31,150 --> 01:38:34,540
I saw him at recreation
a few days ago.

714
01:38:34,750 --> 01:38:37,742
He is also in jail?

715
01:38:37,950 --> 01:38:40,589
I was not aware.

716
01:38:42,150 --> 01:38:43,947
Wait a minute.

717
01:38:47,190 --> 01:38:49,784
I'm going to make a call.

718
01:39:14,110 --> 01:39:15,748
What?

719
01:39:21,150 --> 01:39:23,789
Your brother is dead.

720
01:39:26,710 --> 01:39:31,022
They found him yesterday morning
in the bathroom.

721
01:39:31,230 --> 01:39:33,949
It was suicide.

722
01:39:49,470 --> 01:39:52,621
You have to tell me the story.

723
01:40:01,390 --> 01:40:03,028
Okay.

724
01:40:48,310 --> 01:40:50,187
Hi, Nick.

725
01:40:51,230 --> 01:40:53,141
Hi, Ana.

726
01:40:58,190 --> 01:41:00,943
What happened to your hand?

727
01:41:04,430 --> 01:41:07,661
I removed your tattoo.

728
01:41:15,470 --> 01:41:18,746
- You have a kid.
- Yes.

729
01:41:20,390 --> 01:41:22,984
Alexander.

730
01:41:24,550 --> 01:41:29,704
- Cool.
- He can only cry and sleep.

731
01:41:36,790 --> 01:41:40,499
It can be hard with a little one,
crying all the time.

732
01:41:44,630 --> 01:41:47,349
Have you seen Ivan?

733
01:41:48,990 --> 01:41:53,541
If you see him,
tell him to stay away.

734
01:41:55,270 --> 01:41:57,738
What happened?

735
01:41:59,710 --> 01:42:03,669
Just tell him.
I have to go now.

736
01:42:06,470 --> 01:42:09,462
It was good seeing you.
Take care.

737
01:43:05,510 --> 01:43:09,219
- Hi, Martin.
- Hey, Nick.

738
01:43:10,950 --> 01:43:13,544
How are you?

739
01:43:13,710 --> 01:43:15,507
I don't know.

740
01:43:17,390 --> 01:43:20,905
No. I don't know either.

741
01:43:24,470 --> 01:43:27,667
What happened to your hand?

742
01:43:29,270 --> 01:43:31,181
It fell off.

743
01:43:32,190 --> 01:43:35,546
- But I'll get by, don't you think?
- Yea.

744
01:43:37,910 --> 01:43:40,663
D'you want to accompany me?

745
01:43:40,870 --> 01:43:43,100
Okay.

746
01:43:59,630 --> 01:44:02,508
- Hello.
- Hello.

747
01:44:02,710 --> 01:44:05,543
- Hi, Martin.
- Sit down here.

748
01:44:05,750 --> 01:44:09,026
I would like to sit with him.

749
01:44:10,070 --> 01:44:13,949
I am Martin's uncle.
Can he sit with me?

750
01:44:17,310 --> 01:44:18,663
Come.

751
01:44:29,230 --> 01:44:31,266
Let's sit here.

752
01:44:40,790 --> 01:44:43,509
- We were sitting here the last time, too.
- What?

753
01:44:43,710 --> 01:44:47,589
- I was sitting here the last time with my dad.
- That's right, yes.

754
01:44:56,910 --> 01:45:00,346
Afterwards, I'll tell you
why your name is Martin.

755
01:45:20,710 --> 01:45:23,782
He also has one.

756
01:45:26,030 --> 01:45:27,224
What?

757
01:45:27,430 --> 01:45:30,979
Dad also has one,
so we can find each other.

758
01:46:09,310 --> 01:46:12,586
- You say that?
- Yes, now keep your mouth shut.

759
01:46:12,790 --> 01:46:15,907
We'll do it right.
Like in a church.

760
01:46:18,750 --> 01:46:20,900
Are you ready?

761
01:46:26,390 --> 01:46:29,109
In the Father -

762
01:46:29,310 --> 01:46:31,426
And the Holy Spirit's...

763
01:46:33,590 --> 01:46:36,104
...spirit.

764
01:46:36,310 --> 01:46:40,223
We dub you today...

765
01:46:43,630 --> 01:46:45,700
...Martin.

766
01:46:47,310 --> 01:46:49,107
Yea.

767
01:46:49,990 --> 01:46:53,266
In the Holy Spirit -

768
01:46:53,470 --> 01:46:57,429
your name is now... Martin.
