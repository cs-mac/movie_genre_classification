1
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:16,143
ALL FILMS ARE PART FICTION.

2
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:20,355
NO FILM CAN FAITHFULLY REPRODUCE
THE COMPLEXITY OF A HUMAN LIFE.

3
00:00:20,522 --> 00:00:22,316
EACH TO HIS OWN POINT OF VIEW.

4
00:01:03,982 --> 00:01:08,028
MESRINE: PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE

5
00:01:08,987 --> 00:01:12,241
OUTSKIRTS OF PARIS
NOVEMBER 2, 1979

6
00:01:20,374 --> 00:01:22,042
It's a relief for them.

7
00:01:22,209 --> 00:01:24,711
- How many men?
- About 30, no more.

8
00:01:24,878 --> 00:01:27,089
How long did you follow him?

9
00:01:27,256 --> 00:01:28,674
I'll have details later.

10
00:01:31,551 --> 00:01:34,596
- No police error?
- Absolutely not. Just look.

11
00:01:34,763 --> 00:01:36,348
- It went well?
- Yes.

12
00:01:36,515 --> 00:01:41,228
Two agencies cooperated.
Anti-Crime and Special Tactical.

13
00:01:50,779 --> 00:01:53,532
He opens the door.
We know he's armed.

14
00:01:53,699 --> 00:01:54,825
Two defensive grenades.

15
00:01:54,992 --> 00:01:57,869
We issued a warning,
he didn't surrender.

16
00:01:58,036 --> 00:02:02,332
If he doesn't let the truck pass
he's on the ring road. He gets away.

17
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:03,833
Jojo.

18
00:02:04,918 --> 00:02:05,918
Stretcher!

19
00:02:31,028 --> 00:02:33,030
Enough. Let's get out of here.

20
00:02:34,323 --> 00:02:35,699
One second.

21
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:10,942
1973...

22
00:03:13,779 --> 00:03:15,447
Thursday,

23
00:03:16,865 --> 00:03:18,617
March 8th.

24
00:03:34,674 --> 00:03:36,176
Statement

25
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:40,263
<i>by Mess-teen,</i>

26
00:03:40,806 --> 00:03:41,598
Jacques...

27
00:03:41,765 --> 00:03:42,765
Hey, typist.

28
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,602
What breaks first,
the cuffs or the radiator?

29
00:03:46,436 --> 00:03:48,772
It's not <i>Mess-reen.</i>
It's <i>May-reen.</i>

30
00:03:49,231 --> 00:03:51,650
As in Mirosmesnil, not Miro-mess-nil.

31
00:03:51,817 --> 00:03:53,097
- Or Rosny, not...
- OK, Mesrine.

32
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,322
Your buddies,
Grangier and Ardouin.

33
00:03:57,906 --> 00:03:59,908
Never heard of them.

34
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,328
Hey, I never heard of them.

35
00:04:03,787 --> 00:04:05,372
Mr Jacques!

36
00:04:06,456 --> 00:04:07,456
Aircraft carrier.

37
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,001
Good to see you again.

38
00:04:11,002 --> 00:04:12,712
You put on some weight?

39
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,298
- Fuck that, I'm on a diet.
- Yeah?

40
00:04:15,841 --> 00:04:16,508
I can tell.

41
00:04:16,675 --> 00:04:18,885
Here, I'll prove it.

42
00:04:20,929 --> 00:04:21,929
Always ready.

43
00:04:22,264 --> 00:04:23,557
The aircraft carrier!

44
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,060
Clear.

45
00:04:38,447 --> 00:04:41,199
- Where the fuck you going?
- Let's do this one too.

46
00:04:41,491 --> 00:04:42,701
Hold-up! On the floor!

47
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,540
On the floor.
Let's go, old lady, hurry up!

48
00:04:48,707 --> 00:04:49,875
Don't move!

49
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,960
Don't you move either! Hear me?

50
00:04:52,127 --> 00:04:53,336
Don't move.

51
00:04:54,087 --> 00:04:56,965
Fill that up. Put the money in.
Hurry up!

52
00:04:57,132 --> 00:04:58,175
Fill it up! Hurry!

53
00:04:58,341 --> 00:04:59,801
Hurry up.

54
00:05:03,597 --> 00:05:04,973
Let's go, let's go!

55
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,725
That's two!

56
00:05:06,892 --> 00:05:10,353
So the teller recognised me?
Hooray for the teller!

57
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,105
<i>And Granger and Ardoum, too.</i>

58
00:05:12,522 --> 00:05:13,690
MY ass!

59
00:05:14,483 --> 00:05:16,067
I said I don't know them.

60
00:05:16,443 --> 00:05:20,238
My partners always wear masks.
Tell your teller to eat carrots.

61
00:05:20,405 --> 00:05:22,073
We plucked you like a daisy.

62
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,909
Nothing to strut about.

63
00:05:29,122 --> 00:05:30,874
Don't move!

64
00:05:34,544 --> 00:05:36,463
Give it up, Mesrine. Police.

65
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,049
Robbery, attempted murder, you admit.

66
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:43,303
But not the stolen cheques?

67
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:47,224
I don't mind being honest
about what I did, but...

68
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:50,143
I won't confess to stuff
I didn't! It's logical.

69
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:52,646
We'll have to transfer him
to Compiégne court.

70
00:05:54,105 --> 00:05:55,607
You're going inside.

71
00:05:55,774 --> 00:05:57,609
And for a long time.

72
00:05:57,776 --> 00:06:00,737
I bet I'm out in three months.
Are we on?

73
00:06:19,548 --> 00:06:20,882
What now?

74
00:06:21,258 --> 00:06:23,009
I need to use the john.

75
00:06:23,176 --> 00:06:25,720
I'm sick. Want it on the judge's desk?

76
00:06:26,972 --> 00:06:27,972
Make it fast.

77
00:06:33,103 --> 00:06:35,230
Do I wipe myself with my feet?

78
00:06:38,066 --> 00:06:39,066
Wait.

79
00:06:48,743 --> 00:06:50,912
A fag or he likes sniffing shit?

80
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:52,872
A little privacy.

81
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:58,712
I'll shit on the floor.
Give me some slack.

82
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,923
Slack!

83
00:07:03,091 --> 00:07:04,342
There.

84
00:07:06,261 --> 00:07:08,054
I swear.

85
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,454
Hurry it up.

86
00:07:32,621 --> 00:07:33,872
Be right out.

87
00:07:40,378 --> 00:07:41,378
That's better.

88
00:07:42,255 --> 00:07:44,215
Mr Mesrine, your appearance...

89
00:07:44,382 --> 00:07:47,302
Your Honour, it's not legal
to appear in handcuffs.

90
00:07:47,469 --> 00:07:49,387
It violates my rights.

91
00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:53,183
You lecturing me on the law
is comical.

92
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,060
You won't need your hands.

93
00:07:55,435 --> 00:07:56,102
Your Honour...

94
00:07:56,269 --> 00:07:58,104
That's enough, Mesrine.

95
00:08:01,107 --> 00:08:02,567
Everybody down!

96
00:08:02,859 --> 00:08:03,860
You, uncuff me!

97
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:06,363
Get it off, hurry up.

98
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:08,365
Fat guy, against the wall!

99
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,408
Hurry up!

100
00:08:11,034 --> 00:08:13,411
Nobody move! Nobody! Got me?

101
00:08:13,787 --> 00:08:14,996
You come with me, Judge.

102
00:08:17,957 --> 00:08:20,293
Nobody move! Lie down!

103
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,629
Get up.
You don't move!

104
00:08:22,796 --> 00:08:23,922
Move it.

105
00:08:24,089 --> 00:08:25,757
Don't move!

106
00:08:26,132 --> 00:08:28,176
Drop your guns.
On the ground, fuzz!

107
00:08:29,469 --> 00:08:31,388
Everybody! Nobody move!

108
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,223
You move.

109
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,810
This won't help you.

110
00:08:36,976 --> 00:08:37,976
The yard.

111
00:08:39,604 --> 00:08:42,607
Put the heater down or I'll off him!
Put it down!

112
00:08:42,941 --> 00:08:45,777
I'll shoot the judge.
Get back inside!

113
00:08:45,944 --> 00:08:46,944
Inside!

114
00:08:47,028 --> 00:08:48,947
Get back in your truck! Now!

115
00:08:51,658 --> 00:08:52,701
Call for back-up.

116
00:08:53,785 --> 00:08:54,953
Hurry!

117
00:08:55,161 --> 00:08:56,538
Fucking hurry!

118
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:02,752
- Why not keep the judge?
- Drive!

119
00:09:04,963 --> 00:09:06,047
Move it!

120
00:09:15,306 --> 00:09:16,975
Give me my piece!

121
00:09:18,101 --> 00:09:20,812
Back up or I'll blow you away!
Back up!

122
00:09:22,772 --> 00:09:23,857
I'll blow you away!

123
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:32,782
Out of the way!

124
00:09:58,475 --> 00:10:01,436
Robert, he got plugged.
Can you do something?

125
00:10:01,978 --> 00:10:04,606
I got it.
Yeah, fuck.

126
00:10:05,148 --> 00:10:06,274
Come on.

127
00:10:07,066 --> 00:10:09,569
- Jacques, news from home.
- What?

128
00:10:09,736 --> 00:10:11,279
Your dad's in the hospital.

129
00:10:11,613 --> 00:10:13,114
Let's take care of you.

130
00:10:13,281 --> 00:10:14,281
Shit.

131
00:10:16,826 --> 00:10:21,581
<i>Jacques Mesrine has done worse,
but never as audacious.</i>

132
00:10:22,457 --> 00:10:25,376
<i>He chose the site of his escape.</i>

133
00:10:25,543 --> 00:10:29,672
<i>When arrested last March,
he contested a prior conviction.</i>

134
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,510
<i>He knew he'd be re-tried here,
in Compiegne courthouse.</i>

135
00:10:33,676 --> 00:10:36,679
<i>When he asked
to use the bathroom yesterday,</i>

136
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:40,683
<i>it was because his accomplices...</i>

137
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,435
He's talking about me.

138
00:10:42,936 --> 00:10:45,688
<i>Returning to the courtroom,
he was armed.</i>

139
00:10:45,939 --> 00:10:48,107
<i>"Get down or I'll kill the judge!"</i>

140
00:10:48,274 --> 00:10:49,442
I never said that!

141
00:10:49,901 --> 00:10:51,236
Never!

142
00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:55,281
<i>For policemen all over France
who underestimated him,</i>

143
00:10:55,448 --> 00:10:57,826
<i>there is no doubt that Mesrine</i>

144
00:10:57,992 --> 00:11:01,246
<i>must now be considered
public enemy number one.</i>

145
00:11:02,372 --> 00:11:03,372
Number one!

146
00:11:11,548 --> 00:11:12,590
Hello.

147
00:11:27,814 --> 00:11:29,315
Dad.

148
00:11:31,651 --> 00:11:32,986
It's me.

149
00:11:34,612 --> 00:11:36,030
It's me.

150
00:11:37,115 --> 00:11:38,533
It's Jacques.

151
00:11:43,162 --> 00:11:45,456
- You all right?
- Why did you come?

152
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:50,420
The banks were closed.
I figured I'd visit my father.

153
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:53,214
You came.

154
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:04,893
Did you see your daughter?

155
00:12:06,561 --> 00:12:08,271
Not yet.

156
00:12:08,813 --> 00:12:09,898
You know...

157
00:12:11,691 --> 00:12:15,695
I wasn't much of a son.
I'm not much of a father either.

158
00:12:18,031 --> 00:12:20,742
It's how I am.
What can I say, Dad? I'm sorry.

159
00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:22,410
It's how I am.

160
00:12:23,953 --> 00:12:26,080
It must be my fault.

161
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:36,758
Whatever happens, Jacky...
you're still her father.

162
00:12:42,722 --> 00:12:43,890
I know.

163
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,520
And you're still my son.

164
00:13:05,912 --> 00:13:07,330
I'm sorry.

165
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,123
Forgive me.

166
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:19,300
You better go now.

167
00:13:21,135 --> 00:13:22,135
I know.

168
00:13:48,788 --> 00:13:52,083
His mother, his kids,
his father's employees. Nobody else.

169
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,210
He's not stupid enough to come.

170
00:13:54,627 --> 00:13:57,422
PARIS, SEPTEMBER 1973

171
00:14:05,805 --> 00:14:08,057
What happened? Walk into a door?

172
00:14:08,224 --> 00:14:09,267
No, boxing.

173
00:14:10,101 --> 00:14:11,519
You box?

174
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,191
Michel boxes.

175
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,241
Can you drive?

176
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:29,328
We got a little set-up
in a few days.

177
00:14:29,495 --> 00:14:30,663
Interested?

178
00:14:57,774 --> 00:14:59,108
<i>Re series of hold-ups,</i>

179
00:14:59,275 --> 00:15:02,278
<i>suspect vehicle is
a grey Renault 16.</i>

180
00:15:02,445 --> 00:15:05,114
<i>7791 Yankee Libra 75.</i>

181
00:15:05,531 --> 00:15:06,741
Suspect vehicle located.

182
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:18,461
We've located the suspect car.

183
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:30,139
Public streets are not a trash can.
And you're illegally parked.

184
00:15:30,515 --> 00:15:33,851
Step out of the car
and let me see your paperwork.

185
00:15:37,105 --> 00:15:39,357
I'm waiting. Step out, please.

186
00:15:39,524 --> 00:15:41,692
Don't move. Hands behind you.

187
00:16:09,971 --> 00:16:11,222
Out of the way!

188
00:16:12,932 --> 00:16:14,058
Beat it!

189
00:16:15,852 --> 00:16:16,852
Stop!

190
00:16:19,272 --> 00:16:20,565
Get out!

191
00:16:21,816 --> 00:16:23,109
Open the door!

192
00:16:23,484 --> 00:16:24,652
Get out!

193
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,410
Get out!

194
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:39,791
Don't move!

195
00:16:43,796 --> 00:16:44,964
Go!

196
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:04,232
There!

197
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:08,154
We'll take La Chapelle.

198
00:17:10,615 --> 00:17:11,615
Turn right.

199
00:17:20,082 --> 00:17:21,292
That way!

200
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:22,752
There!

201
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:41,144
Fuck!

202
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:49,319
Come on!

203
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:56,159
Move it!

204
00:18:06,921 --> 00:18:07,921
Out of the way!

205
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:13,219
We're good. Come on!

206
00:18:21,352 --> 00:18:22,352
Take a seat!

207
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:24,604
Nobody move!

208
00:18:39,078 --> 00:18:41,205
- Eyes down!
- Fuck, my ear.

209
00:18:46,377 --> 00:18:49,213
I told you he couldn't cut it!
He's a geek.

210
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,132
You almost got us nabbed.

211
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:53,217
Fine, you were right.

212
00:18:53,384 --> 00:18:55,344
I'm sorry. Now give me a break!

213
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:58,389
A break? The cops got him.
So what do you think?

214
00:18:58,556 --> 00:19:00,725
He'll flip like a pancake.

215
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:04,729
Fuck.

216
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:06,230
Listen up.

217
00:19:06,522 --> 00:19:09,108
A guy I choose never flips.
Got me?

218
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:10,943
Fuck you.

219
00:19:15,448 --> 00:19:16,448
Never!

220
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:24,081
Since you're so smart,
you work it out alone.

221
00:19:24,582 --> 00:19:25,582
Fuck off, Mesrine.

222
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:26,666
Get out of here.

223
00:19:30,129 --> 00:19:32,048
Leave! Everybody out!

224
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:33,424
Let's go, let's go.

225
00:20:12,046 --> 00:20:13,047
Commissaire Broussard.

226
00:20:15,716 --> 00:20:16,967
Do we wait much longer?

227
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,803
I'll let you know.

228
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:21,597
My guys have been on the roof
for eight hours. It's raining.

229
00:20:22,348 --> 00:20:24,683
I noticed. I'll let you know.

230
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:29,355
Pain in the ass!

231
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:40,783
Police! Open the door!

232
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,205
Give up. You're surrounded.

233
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,800
Police. Give it up.
The building is surrounded.

234
00:20:57,967 --> 00:20:58,968
What?

235
00:21:00,261 --> 00:21:01,637
What's going on?

236
00:21:01,846 --> 00:21:04,140
Who's there?
What do you want?

237
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:06,434
Come out, or I'll bust the door down.

238
00:21:08,561 --> 00:21:11,856
Fuck off!
I'm with the Baader-Meinhof gang.

239
00:21:12,982 --> 00:21:14,984
I'll blow the place sky high.

240
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:17,445
Long live the revolution!

241
00:21:17,611 --> 00:21:18,737
Get dressed.

242
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:20,197
Yes. Wonderful.

243
00:21:21,574 --> 00:21:22,616
Thank you.

244
00:21:23,242 --> 00:21:25,453
Quit it, Jacques.
You're overacting.

245
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:31,375
- Who's calling me Jacques?
- Robert Broussard.

246
00:21:32,168 --> 00:21:34,044
Commissaire, anti-crime unit.

247
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:39,341
Broussard? The chin beard?

248
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,887
The one who gets
his picture in the papers?

249
00:21:43,262 --> 00:21:44,638
That's right.

250
00:21:45,181 --> 00:21:47,391
Now stop all this and surrender.

251
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:48,558
First off, fuck you.

252
00:21:49,143 --> 00:21:50,895
Secondly, how do I know it's you?

253
00:21:51,187 --> 00:21:52,771
Slide your card under.

254
00:21:53,189 --> 00:21:54,565
And get shot through the door?

255
00:21:54,857 --> 00:21:56,984
Same goes for me when I pick it up.

256
00:21:58,152 --> 00:21:59,153
That's true.

257
00:22:08,704 --> 00:22:11,540
You have my word.
You know who I am. I don't lie.

258
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:13,250
I won't shoot.

259
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,878
Come on, Broussard.

260
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:17,713
Be brave.

261
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:21,967
All right, Jacques.

262
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:23,260
I'm waiting.

263
00:22:25,763 --> 00:22:26,847
There.

264
00:22:43,364 --> 00:22:44,406
Well?

265
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:53,666
Broussard.

266
00:22:56,961 --> 00:22:58,546
I need two favours.

267
00:22:58,712 --> 00:22:59,880
If they're reasonable.

268
00:23:01,507 --> 00:23:04,677
First, the girl with me.
Leave her be, she's irrelevant.

269
00:23:05,469 --> 00:23:08,264
Second, give me 20 minutes.
I got stuff to do.

270
00:23:08,847 --> 00:23:11,725
Anything else?
A car and a chauffeur?

271
00:23:11,892 --> 00:23:13,185
I get that anyway.

272
00:23:13,352 --> 00:23:15,729
No choice. It's that or war.

273
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:18,941
Well?

274
00:23:24,488 --> 00:23:25,948
Twenty minutes, Jacques.

275
00:23:26,365 --> 00:23:27,575
Twenty!

276
00:23:32,121 --> 00:23:34,623
What do we do?
What do I do?

277
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:37,876
What do I do?

278
00:23:38,043 --> 00:23:40,296
Give me something to do.

279
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:42,631
What will they do to me?

280
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:44,842
Those matches on the table.

281
00:23:45,134 --> 00:23:46,176
On the table.

282
00:23:52,808 --> 00:23:54,018
Will they arrest me?

283
00:23:54,518 --> 00:23:55,936
Put me in jail?

284
00:23:56,353 --> 00:23:58,522
I don't want to go to jail.

285
00:23:58,689 --> 00:24:00,149
Relax, relax.

286
00:24:00,316 --> 00:24:01,483
I can't...

287
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,900
Shut up!

288
00:24:04,445 --> 00:24:05,446
All right?

289
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:07,406
Shut the hell up!

290
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:13,871
What will they do to me?

291
00:24:16,248 --> 00:24:18,375
Calm down. It'll be fine.

292
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,340
Calm down.

293
00:24:40,064 --> 00:24:41,899
What are you doing, Mesrine?

294
00:24:42,441 --> 00:24:44,276
You setting us up?

295
00:24:45,486 --> 00:24:47,154
I said 20 minutes, not 45.

296
00:24:48,364 --> 00:24:49,364
Broussard,

297
00:24:50,449 --> 00:24:54,161
got the balls to come and get me
with no gun and no vest?

298
00:24:55,037 --> 00:24:56,747
Why should I?

299
00:24:57,623 --> 00:24:59,667
To see if you can.

300
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,460
I would anyway.

301
00:25:02,753 --> 00:25:04,171
Broussard, coward.

302
00:25:05,089 --> 00:25:07,966
Sure you fight in my weight category?

303
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:13,055
Well, Broussard?

304
00:25:14,682 --> 00:25:15,682
I'm going in.

305
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:30,948
All right, Jacques.

306
00:25:31,115 --> 00:25:33,617
I dropped the vest and the gun.

307
00:25:33,784 --> 00:25:36,161
You got the balls to come out unarmed?

308
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:42,501
What do you call that?

309
00:25:50,634 --> 00:25:52,511
Hey, artist. For posterity.

310
00:25:52,678 --> 00:25:54,722
Broussard's moment of glory.

311
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:55,931
If you say so.

312
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:03,147
Wonder why I didn't off you
and your boys before?

313
00:26:03,647 --> 00:26:05,232
Cops don't think, they act.

314
00:26:05,733 --> 00:26:06,775
There was a lady.

315
00:26:07,484 --> 00:26:08,819
That's the only reason.

316
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:10,362
There was a lady.

317
00:26:10,821 --> 00:26:13,866
Next time, no ladies.
And no champagne, Broussard.

318
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:15,743
Just you and me.

319
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:20,788
So...

320
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,083
Till we meet again.

321
00:26:33,969 --> 00:26:37,222
LA SANTE PRISON
PARIS, 1973

322
00:27:15,761 --> 00:27:17,095
Guard.

323
00:27:20,182 --> 00:27:21,182
Guard!

324
00:27:29,691 --> 00:27:31,318
What do you want, Jacques?

325
00:27:31,985 --> 00:27:35,030
Who is this guy? Pinochet?

326
00:27:36,448 --> 00:27:38,200
He's a Chilean general.

327
00:27:39,326 --> 00:27:40,452
A Chilean general?

328
00:27:42,496 --> 00:27:46,792
Some bum named Pinochet gets page one.
Not a line about me.

329
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:48,126
It's a coup d'état.

330
00:27:48,293 --> 00:27:49,293
A coup d'état?

331
00:27:50,629 --> 00:27:52,464
Find me a typewriter.

332
00:27:53,966 --> 00:27:55,259
I'm going to write.

333
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:57,386
I'll see what I can do.

334
00:27:57,553 --> 00:27:58,804
Go, yeah.

335
00:28:49,438 --> 00:28:51,023
Can you explain this?

336
00:28:51,189 --> 00:28:52,649
MARCH, 1977

337
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,610
That's my book.

338
00:28:55,986 --> 00:28:57,905
It's not a book, it's suicide.

339
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:03,994
You're on trial in two months
and you publish 40 murder confessions.

340
00:29:05,037 --> 00:29:05,704
Right now,

341
00:29:05,871 --> 00:29:08,624
every policeman in France
is perusing your book.

342
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:12,794
They'll compare it with cold cases
and they'll go and dig up corpses.

343
00:29:14,212 --> 00:29:17,007
If they dig, they better dig here.

344
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:20,093
Why?

345
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:22,054
It's not true?

346
00:29:22,346 --> 00:29:25,182
People like pace. Action.

347
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:26,933
And?

348
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:31,647
Anyway, no jury will think
I'm stupid enough

349
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:34,483
to confess stuff
that will get me the guillotine.

350
00:29:36,735 --> 00:29:38,612
You know, on the street...

351
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,864
I'm a star.

352
00:29:42,157 --> 00:29:45,285
You amuse people,
but you scare them too.

353
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:49,498
If they can assuage that fear
by locking you up, they will.

354
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:54,169
You're so middle class, Counsellor.
It's a sight to see.

355
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:58,173
The judge allowed a visit.

356
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:48,639
I grew up.

357
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:53,311
I can see that.

358
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:57,482
I'm not a baby any more.

359
00:31:01,987 --> 00:31:03,196
You're beautiful.

360
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:07,117
Thank you.

361
00:31:15,584 --> 00:31:16,752
And your brothers?

362
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:21,131
Boris and Bruno are fine.

363
00:31:21,673 --> 00:31:23,341
They screw around a lot.

364
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:27,304
How strange!

365
00:31:32,601 --> 00:31:35,228
Don't get on motorcycles with punks.

366
00:31:37,147 --> 00:31:39,357
Doing the father thing again?

367
00:31:40,776 --> 00:31:42,986
You're not around to watch me.

368
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:46,531
Be careful anyway.

369
00:31:57,042 --> 00:31:58,919
When will you be back?

370
00:32:04,382 --> 00:32:05,926
Not right away.

371
00:32:11,014 --> 00:32:12,724
I'm sorry, baby.

372
00:32:15,644 --> 00:32:17,729
This is no way to see each other.

373
00:32:18,188 --> 00:32:19,523
It's better.

374
00:32:20,273 --> 00:32:23,985
If I want to see you,
I know where to find you.

375
00:32:29,574 --> 00:32:31,118
I miss you.

376
00:32:50,095 --> 00:32:51,429
Jacques Mesrine,

377
00:32:52,764 --> 00:32:55,851
you still deny any relationship

378
00:32:56,017 --> 00:32:56,768
with Ardouin?

379
00:32:56,935 --> 00:32:59,396
I told you, I don't know the guy.

380
00:32:59,563 --> 00:33:00,772
Mr Ardouin, please rise

381
00:33:00,939 --> 00:33:02,899
so Mesrine can see you better.

382
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:08,113
No, I don't recognise the face.

383
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,907
With that schnoz, I'd remember!

384
00:33:13,994 --> 00:33:17,581
Do you deny taking a judge hostage

385
00:33:17,747 --> 00:33:18,999
to cover your escape?

386
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:19,791
What?

387
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:23,712
Like any good citizen,
I sought judicial protection.

388
00:33:23,879 --> 00:33:25,797
What's wrong with that?

389
00:33:27,716 --> 00:33:31,011
Do you still intend
to escape once again?

390
00:33:34,973 --> 00:33:38,059
Your Honour,
behind that 101 Dalmatians scarf,

391
00:33:38,226 --> 00:33:39,311
you should know

392
00:33:39,477 --> 00:33:41,313
that when in hell,

393
00:33:41,813 --> 00:33:44,232
escape is a right.
I'd even say...

394
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:45,817
it's a duty.

395
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,195
And moreover, it's a business.

396
00:33:48,528 --> 00:33:51,239
I never speak
unless I can back it up.

397
00:33:52,616 --> 00:33:55,869
Ladies and gentlemen,
do you know what this key is?

398
00:33:56,036 --> 00:33:57,662
Know what it is?

399
00:33:57,954 --> 00:34:01,291
It's just the key
to my transfer handcuffs.

400
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:04,586
Look at the face they're making.

401
00:34:04,878 --> 00:34:06,630
Want to know how I got it?

402
00:34:06,838 --> 00:34:09,841
I bought it from a prison employee.

403
00:34:10,008 --> 00:34:12,302
For 3,000 francs!

404
00:34:13,553 --> 00:34:14,553
Journalists,

405
00:34:15,138 --> 00:34:16,138
jurors,

406
00:34:17,182 --> 00:34:21,645
that's the state of the system
the DA strives vainly to uphold.

407
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:25,440
As Commissaire Broussard,
clever as usual,

408
00:34:25,607 --> 00:34:27,192
is seated near the reporters...

409
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:28,902
Commissaire!

410
00:34:29,527 --> 00:34:30,862
Check it yourself.

411
00:34:33,907 --> 00:34:37,369
And why do you possess
so many arms, Mr Mesrine?

412
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,584
Your Honour, how can I put this?

413
00:34:44,751 --> 00:34:47,796
An inexplicable feeling of danger

414
00:34:47,963 --> 00:34:50,006
has dogged me since childhood.

415
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:56,429
Don't complain.
I take care of my enemies.

416
00:34:56,596 --> 00:34:59,182
Less work for the police,
more for the ambulance men!

417
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,563
He has forged the image

418
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,107
of a pleasant man.

419
00:35:07,857 --> 00:35:09,776
An outlaw, of course,

420
00:35:09,943 --> 00:35:11,945
but who wouldn't harm a fly,

421
00:35:12,696 --> 00:35:15,073
even treats his victims kindly.

422
00:35:16,032 --> 00:35:17,909
What a joke!

423
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:23,248
Nothing more than a pretence,
to cover

424
00:35:23,415 --> 00:35:24,958
his ruthlessness!

425
00:35:26,001 --> 00:35:28,378
There are no clean gangsters.

426
00:35:28,545 --> 00:35:31,423
There are only gangsters.

427
00:35:32,424 --> 00:35:35,719
And you are a gangster, Mesrine.

428
00:35:37,595 --> 00:35:40,056
You shoot whenever necessary.

429
00:35:40,223 --> 00:35:42,600
When things go wrong,
you go all the way.

430
00:35:48,064 --> 00:35:49,691
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

431
00:35:49,858 --> 00:35:52,902
you must apply the law
and impose sanction.

432
00:35:53,528 --> 00:35:56,156
There is no society

433
00:35:56,323 --> 00:35:58,158
if there is no sanction.

434
00:36:14,382 --> 00:36:17,010
So I'm public enemy number one?

435
00:36:19,012 --> 00:36:20,972
That's all bullshit.

436
00:36:21,848 --> 00:36:23,933
I'm the enemy of one public entity.
Banks!

437
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,311
Of course... I rob them!

438
00:36:26,478 --> 00:36:28,938
So, hey, they don't like me.

439
00:36:29,522 --> 00:36:31,149
But when I rob a bank,

440
00:36:31,775 --> 00:36:33,818
I don't feel I'm breaking the law.

441
00:36:33,985 --> 00:36:36,905
I'm just robbing
a bigger robber than myself.

442
00:36:39,908 --> 00:36:42,118
Want to toss me in a hole?

443
00:36:42,285 --> 00:36:44,746
Throw away the key and forget?

444
00:36:44,913 --> 00:36:47,582
Go ahead, toss me in that hole.

445
00:36:47,999 --> 00:36:49,417
But I'll escape.

446
00:36:50,668 --> 00:36:51,961
I will escape.

447
00:36:53,046 --> 00:36:54,839
You can count on that!

448
00:36:56,174 --> 00:37:00,678
<i>The court and jury,

459
00:37:43,471 --> 00:37:46,724
Mr Bernard, got a light, please?

460
00:37:47,225 --> 00:37:48,768
Sure, Mr Jacques.

461
00:37:54,399 --> 00:37:55,399
Thank you.

462
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,245
- Hi, Luc.
- Hi, Jacques.

463
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:18,714
Hi.

464
00:38:24,262 --> 00:38:26,806
Why the exercise? Got plans?

465
00:38:33,855 --> 00:38:35,690
You can answer me.

466
00:38:36,065 --> 00:38:37,317
I'm Jacques Mesrine.

467
00:38:39,194 --> 00:38:42,947
So?
What are you doing in my yard?

468
00:38:45,825 --> 00:38:49,287
Around here,
I pretty much get what I want.

469
00:38:52,832 --> 00:38:53,958
I can see that.

470
00:38:54,584 --> 00:38:56,085
You know...

471
00:38:56,961 --> 00:38:58,922
I've escaped three times already.

472
00:39:00,381 --> 00:39:01,466
So have I.

473
00:39:05,512 --> 00:39:06,512
Yeah, but...

474
00:39:11,976 --> 00:39:13,228
maybe...

475
00:39:14,521 --> 00:39:16,397
I'd like to do it again.

476
00:39:19,901 --> 00:39:22,237
Name's Frangois Besse.

477
00:39:23,988 --> 00:39:25,198
So I heard.

478
00:39:37,627 --> 00:39:39,879
<i>No news

479

<i>whose execution...</i>

480
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:43,299
Search!

481
00:39:43,466 --> 00:39:47,178
<i>- ... By the Red Brigades last night-
In Rome, Victor Brave.</i>

482
00:39:47,345 --> 00:39:50,848
<i>It's now been 52 days
since the Rome police...</i>

483
00:39:57,021 --> 00:39:58,314
Search!

484
00:40:14,539 --> 00:40:17,584
<i>When Aldo Moro was kidnapped
on March 16th,</i>

485
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:20,461
<i>Italians were shocked by the murder</i>

486

00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,118
It's the foil wrapper.

489
00:40:52,285 --> 00:40:53,453
All right.

490
00:41:18,061 --> 00:41:19,395
Your lawyer's here.

491
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,960
Chief!

492
00:41:45,129 --> 00:41:46,631
Inside. I'm cold.

493
00:41:46,798 --> 00:41:49,008
Two minutes. First we get Jacques in.

494
00:41:50,968 --> 00:41:52,011
Two minutes.

495
00:42:07,193 --> 00:42:08,319
Hello.

496
00:42:11,322 --> 00:42:12,365
What's going on?

497
00:42:13,074 --> 00:42:15,284
About this Canada thing.

498
00:42:16,828 --> 00:42:18,079
I don't have the file.

499
00:42:19,872 --> 00:42:21,290
No problem.

500
00:42:21,999 --> 00:42:22,999
Chief!

501
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:27,588
- What is it?
- We need a file.

502
00:42:28,965 --> 00:42:30,174
My neighbour has it.

503
00:42:30,341 --> 00:42:31,968
I wanted his advice.

504
00:42:32,468 --> 00:42:33,761
- Besse?
- Right.

505
00:42:33,928 --> 00:42:34,928
Did you hear?

506
00:42:34,971 --> 00:42:36,681
Get the file, please.

507
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,185
All right.

508
00:42:41,477 --> 00:42:43,229
Thanks, Chief.

509
00:43:28,149 --> 00:43:30,318
This gets out, I'm disbarred.

510
00:43:35,072 --> 00:43:37,074
- That's my whole life.
- Don't worry.

511
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:39,786
You're saving my life,

512
00:43:41,496 --> 00:43:42,955
I won't mess yours up.

513
00:43:44,499 --> 00:43:45,792
This will work.

514
00:43:48,294 --> 00:43:49,921
It's working already.

515
00:43:51,964 --> 00:43:53,966
Mesrine says you got his file.

516
00:44:00,515 --> 00:44:02,016
We got a problem.

517
00:44:02,975 --> 00:44:04,143
Step back.

518
00:44:34,674 --> 00:44:36,509
Besse, what are you doing there?

519
00:44:39,554 --> 00:44:42,557
What's going on here?
Against the wall!

520
00:44:42,974 --> 00:44:43,974
Gun!

521
00:44:44,642 --> 00:44:46,894
Strip! Hurry up, get undressed.

522
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,771
Don't look at me like that.

523
00:44:49,564 --> 00:44:50,773
The trousers!

524
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,900
Hurry up, faster!

525
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:00,116
Look at the wall. Hands up!

526
00:45:00,533 --> 00:45:01,868
Shut up!

527
00:45:02,034 --> 00:45:03,578
Wait a second.

528
00:45:03,744 --> 00:45:04,744
Let me come.

529
00:45:04,829 --> 00:45:06,330
I'm doing life!

530
00:45:07,123 --> 00:45:08,207
Easy!

531
00:45:08,374 --> 00:45:10,751
Let's go, girls. This way. Hurry.

532
00:45:11,419 --> 00:45:12,044
The cell!

533
00:45:12,211 --> 00:45:13,421
Hurry up!

534
00:45:17,258 --> 00:45:18,342
Listen to me.

535
00:45:18,509 --> 00:45:20,511
You're an inmate, got it?

536
00:45:24,891 --> 00:45:26,100
Here, take this.

537
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:02,637
Don't move!

538
00:46:04,597 --> 00:46:06,682
Shut up and walk, got it?

539
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,560
Shut up.

540
00:46:11,854 --> 00:46:13,272
Get down.

541
00:46:14,023 --> 00:46:15,358
Get down. Move your ass.

542
00:46:15,566 --> 00:46:16,817
Get the ladder.

543
00:46:16,984 --> 00:46:18,486
Anybody want in?

544
00:46:19,236 --> 00:46:19,946
Nobody?

545
00:46:20,112 --> 00:46:21,739
Too bad for you.

546
00:46:21,989 --> 00:46:23,616
Move your ass.

547
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:39,632
Don't move. Lower your gun!

548
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:42,843
Throw your gun down!

549
00:46:44,971 --> 00:46:46,430
Throw that piece down!

550
00:46:47,682 --> 00:46:48,682
Against the wall!

551
00:46:50,059 --> 00:46:51,268
- Take this.
- What?

552
00:46:51,811 --> 00:46:53,270
Ladder against the wall!

553
00:46:53,437 --> 00:46:54,271
Hurry up!

554
00:46:54,438 --> 00:46:55,523
Take your jacket off.

555
00:46:57,024 --> 00:46:58,234
Take it off, goddammit!

556
00:47:00,069 --> 00:47:01,069
We're good!

557
00:47:04,365 --> 00:47:05,365
Give me that.

558
00:47:07,576 --> 00:47:08,911
Come here.

559
00:47:09,328 --> 00:47:11,080
Francois, gloves.

560
00:47:15,793 --> 00:47:16,836
Cover us.

561
00:47:17,128 --> 00:47:18,838
- Cover us!
- I got it.

562
00:47:19,005 --> 00:47:20,256
Cover us!

563
00:47:27,638 --> 00:47:29,765
One move, I'll blow you away!

564
00:47:35,187 --> 00:47:36,480
Hook it on!

565
00:48:12,308 --> 00:48:13,308
Sir!

566
00:48:14,226 --> 00:48:15,644
Police requisition.

567
00:48:16,562 --> 00:48:17,605
Hurry up!

568
00:48:17,772 --> 00:48:18,439
Get down.

569
00:48:18,606 --> 00:48:20,191
Get out of the vehicle.

570
00:48:20,399 --> 00:48:21,484
Quick.

571
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,404
- Get out!
- Out!

572
00:48:29,533 --> 00:48:30,826
Get the hell out!

573
00:48:35,456 --> 00:48:36,456
Come on!

574
00:48:39,835 --> 00:48:40,835
Quick!

575
00:48:47,551 --> 00:48:48,551
Come on!

576
00:48:52,264 --> 00:48:53,264
Hurry up!

577
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:55,850
Let's go!

578
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:09,949
<i>Horror to the end.
The Red Brigades' challenge to all Italy</i>

579
00:49:10,116 --> 00:49:14,328
<i>ends in forfeit and murder.
Aldo Moro is dead.</i>

580
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:19,667
<i>The Christian Democratic president
lost his life to the cruel gambit.</i>

581
00:49:19,834 --> 00:49:23,420
<i>No 10th communique' was necessary.</i>

582
00:49:23,587 --> 00:49:25,089
<i>An anonymous caller</i>

583
00:49:25,548 --> 00:49:28,217
<i>spoke of a car bomb</i>

584
00:49:28,384 --> 00:49:29,885
<i>near Communist Party headquarters.</i>

585
00:49:30,052 --> 00:49:32,096
<i>There was no bomb,</i>

586
00:49:32,263 --> 00:49:34,473
<i>but a man in the back seat...</i>

587
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,267
<i>a dead man, Aldo Moro.</i>

588
00:49:37,434 --> 00:49:39,562
Fuck, where were you?

589
00:49:39,854 --> 00:49:41,147
Let me know.

590
00:49:42,273 --> 00:49:43,399
Jean-Luc,

591
00:49:44,275 --> 00:49:47,695
it's my pleasure to introduce

592
00:49:48,154 --> 00:49:49,905
Princess Annie

593
00:49:50,364 --> 00:49:51,782
and Princess Christiane.

594
00:49:51,949 --> 00:49:52,992
Good evening.

595
00:49:53,993 --> 00:49:56,829
My cousin Jean-Luc.
He sells guns, as you can see.

596
00:49:56,996 --> 00:49:57,830
Sit down.

597
00:49:57,997 --> 00:50:00,499
Be nice to him, please.
Be very nice.

598
00:50:02,376 --> 00:50:04,962
Look at him.
He needs it so much.

599
00:50:07,673 --> 00:50:08,673
Are they real?

600
00:50:08,716 --> 00:50:09,967
Don't touch!

601
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:15,389
So...

602
00:50:16,015 --> 00:50:17,015
Bruno.

603
00:50:17,933 --> 00:50:19,018
Jean-Luc?

604
00:50:20,102 --> 00:50:21,102
Come here.

605
00:50:23,105 --> 00:50:25,900
Help yourselves.
And don't touch anything.

606
00:50:26,066 --> 00:50:27,818
Don't touch the pistols.

607
00:50:28,986 --> 00:50:30,279
Be right back.

608
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:36,285
- Well?
- What are these bimbos?

609
00:50:36,452 --> 00:50:38,245
- Not bimbos.
- What are they?

610
00:50:40,748 --> 00:50:46,337
<i>Jacques Mesrine has escaped.
Though we avoid sensationalism,</i>

611
00:50:46,503 --> 00:50:49,465
<i>we must report,
public enemy number one</i>

612
00:50:49,632 --> 00:50:51,842
<i>has been free since this morning.</i>

613
00:50:52,009 --> 00:50:54,762
<i>This is his third escape,</i>

614
00:50:54,929 --> 00:50:57,514
<i>each more spectacular than the last.</i>

615
00:50:57,890 --> 00:50:59,892
Jerking off to lingerie ads!

616
00:51:02,937 --> 00:51:06,190
<i>Two inmates were with him.
One was shot and killed...</i>

617
00:51:06,357 --> 00:51:10,527
You like salad, I like a pink taco.
That's what I'm going to eat.

618
00:51:13,113 --> 00:51:14,907
Francois, don't...

619
00:51:15,282 --> 00:51:16,575
Don't ruin this for me.

620
00:51:21,622 --> 00:51:24,250
We're going.
Your friend doesn't seem well.

621
00:51:24,416 --> 00:51:26,210
No, come here.

622
00:51:26,961 --> 00:51:29,004
Annie! Francois, what is this?

623
00:51:29,171 --> 00:51:30,171
Stay.

624
00:51:30,297 --> 00:51:33,801
You're scaring Annie.
Turn the TV back on, please.

625
00:51:33,968 --> 00:51:37,137
Don't believe the press.
Nasty bunch of liars.

626
00:51:37,304 --> 00:51:39,098
We'll have to move.

627
00:51:40,224 --> 00:51:42,518
Again? Hey, Francois!

628
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:46,689
Was that you on TV?

629
00:51:47,439 --> 00:51:49,191
Call me Jacques.

630
00:51:49,358 --> 00:51:50,818
<i>Jacques Mess-teen'?</i>

631
00:51:51,193 --> 00:51:53,988
<i>May-reen. Jacques Mesrine.</i>

632
00:51:57,616 --> 00:51:58,701
Nice to meet you.

633
00:52:15,926 --> 00:52:17,594
Chief Detective Vaugier.

634
00:52:17,761 --> 00:52:19,096
Division Inspector Heriot.

635
00:52:22,891 --> 00:52:24,101
Your supervisor in?

636
00:52:24,268 --> 00:52:26,270
I'm the station chief.

637
00:52:27,771 --> 00:52:29,565
Always so many of you here?

638
00:52:30,482 --> 00:52:33,235
All the way from Paris
to check my duty roster?

639
00:52:33,944 --> 00:52:35,696
Don't give me lip, Officer.

640
00:52:39,867 --> 00:52:42,619
How many on duty usually,
in the evening?

641
00:52:43,078 --> 00:52:44,997
About ten, total staff.

642
00:52:45,706 --> 00:52:47,791
What did I tell you? Not bad.

643
00:52:51,003 --> 00:52:52,003
Why?

644
00:52:53,255 --> 00:52:57,009
Lately, have you heard
of any activity at all

645
00:52:57,176 --> 00:52:59,261
concerning those two nutcases?

646
00:53:00,095 --> 00:53:01,472
Besse and Mesrine.

647
00:53:03,307 --> 00:53:06,852
You think they'd dare
try something around here?

648
00:53:07,394 --> 00:53:10,064
With those two, you never know.
Right?

649
00:53:10,856 --> 00:53:13,650
Anyway, watch the little guy.
He's the worst.

650
00:53:18,489 --> 00:53:21,825
Henri, we better not linger.
We got work to do.

651
00:53:24,036 --> 00:53:25,036
Thank you, sir.

652
00:53:25,829 --> 00:53:27,706
See you soon. Well...

653
00:53:29,041 --> 00:53:31,085
Not too soon, I hope.

654
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:40,636
Supposed to be a handful.
It's a regiment.

655
00:53:40,803 --> 00:53:44,765
Come on. Even with an army,
they're just chicken-shit cops.

656
00:54:35,357 --> 00:54:37,443
Counterfeit bills, you say.

657
00:54:40,988 --> 00:54:43,657
You want to check the vault for them.

658
00:54:44,324 --> 00:54:45,617
That would be best.

659
00:54:54,251 --> 00:54:55,836
Got a warrant?

660
00:54:59,047 --> 00:55:01,967
- Our police ID.
- No, a warrant.

661
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,180
A warrant.

662
00:55:11,351 --> 00:55:13,353
A warrant. You want a warrant?

663
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:15,022
I got a warrant. Look.

664
00:55:16,482 --> 00:55:18,817
A nice warrant. A Warrant Zevon!

665
00:55:18,984 --> 00:55:20,319
Fill that up, old man.

666
00:55:20,611 --> 00:55:21,695
Hurry it up.

667
00:55:21,862 --> 00:55:23,322
Let's go, the vault!

668
00:55:24,156 --> 00:55:25,699
The vault.

669
00:55:26,366 --> 00:55:27,493
There.

670
00:55:28,076 --> 00:55:29,578
Hurry it up.

671
00:55:30,829 --> 00:55:32,623
Don't look at me like that.

672
00:56:17,501 --> 00:56:18,961
- Ready?
- Ready!

673
00:56:43,402 --> 00:56:44,402
Come on!

674
00:56:45,153 --> 00:56:46,154
Come on, fuck!

675
00:56:47,781 --> 00:56:48,781
OK, go!

676
00:57:01,378 --> 00:57:02,378
Hang on!

677
00:57:15,267 --> 00:57:16,768
Search party, fall in!

678
00:57:24,484 --> 00:57:25,235
No way!

679
00:57:25,402 --> 00:57:27,154
- It's dead.
- Shit.

680
00:57:33,076 --> 00:57:34,119
Close the ranks!

681
00:57:37,873 --> 00:57:38,915
Attention!

682
00:57:47,716 --> 00:57:49,092
Detail ready!

683
00:57:52,554 --> 00:57:54,097
That's OK, but my leg...

684
00:57:55,265 --> 00:57:56,600
Report to squad command!

685
00:57:57,726 --> 00:57:58,726
Search detail,

686
00:57:59,102 --> 00:58:00,102
deploy!

687
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:01,938
Give me your tie.

688
00:58:02,189 --> 00:58:03,189
Right face!

689
00:58:04,691 --> 00:58:06,068
Move out!

690
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:23,311
<i>Jacques Mesrine and an accomplice

691

696
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:37,659
Enough, huh?

697
00:59:40,996 --> 00:59:43,582
There. That's better.

698
00:59:43,749 --> 00:59:44,791
See these threads?

699
00:59:53,633 --> 00:59:55,010
Thanks for the threads.

700
01:00:44,851 --> 01:00:45,851
Well.

701
01:00:47,771 --> 01:00:50,273
What do you think if,
instead of school,

702
01:00:50,732 --> 01:00:52,442
we went for a nice drive?

703
01:00:52,609 --> 01:00:54,528
With your uncles Francois and Jacques?

704
01:00:55,195 --> 01:00:56,195
And Dad,

705
01:00:56,863 --> 01:00:57,614
and Mum,

706
01:00:57,781 --> 01:00:59,282
if she wants to go.

707
01:01:01,993 --> 01:01:03,286
Let's vote.

708
01:01:03,453 --> 01:01:04,830
I want to go.

709
01:01:04,996 --> 01:01:07,332
Francois, what do you say?

710
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:12,045
That's two of us.

711
01:01:14,089 --> 01:01:15,715
Dad?

712
01:01:16,883 --> 01:01:17,968
There.

713
01:01:18,593 --> 01:01:20,595
And Mum?

714
01:01:23,849 --> 01:01:24,891
And the kids.

715
01:01:25,642 --> 01:01:28,228
There! The whole family agrees.

716
01:01:30,522 --> 01:01:31,815
A good thing.

717
01:01:37,821 --> 01:01:38,821
OK, let's go.

718
01:01:55,213 --> 01:01:57,007
Watch your back.

719
01:02:00,427 --> 01:02:01,636
Come here.

720
01:02:03,305 --> 01:02:04,931
What's your name?

721
01:02:05,181 --> 01:02:06,181
Daniel.

722
01:02:07,058 --> 01:02:09,519
You know the back roads to Chaufour?

723
01:02:11,313 --> 01:02:14,274
You take them
and you let us off there.

724
01:02:14,649 --> 01:02:15,859
All right?

725
01:02:16,818 --> 01:02:18,320
Otherwise...

726
01:02:20,071 --> 01:02:22,365
Need me to draw you a picture?

727
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,745
Good.

728
01:02:33,668 --> 01:02:34,668
Go ahead.

729
01:02:36,588 --> 01:02:39,007
Let's go, move it up!

730
01:02:42,135 --> 01:02:43,553
Move it up!

731
01:02:47,849 --> 01:02:49,309
Ma'am.

732
01:02:49,476 --> 01:02:50,769
National Guard.

733
01:02:54,731 --> 01:02:59,736
<i>Though 300 guardsmen
combed Alencon woods south of Bernay,</i>

734
01:03:00,028 --> 01:03:04,616
<i>despite the dogs, helicopters
and SWAT team squads...</i>

735
01:03:05,116 --> 01:03:06,743
What's this?

736
01:03:08,745 --> 01:03:09,745
A roadblock.

737
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:11,998
Open the trunk, please.

738
01:03:12,248 --> 01:03:14,376
Put up the armrest, radio off!

739
01:03:16,211 --> 01:03:18,338
Put up the armrest, kids.

740
01:03:22,801 --> 01:03:24,678
Oh, my God.

741
01:03:31,935 --> 01:03:34,229
Move it out, please. Move out.

742
01:03:36,773 --> 01:03:37,774
Stop.

743
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:41,319
Ma'am. Anything to tell us?

744
01:03:41,695 --> 01:03:43,446
We're going to check your car.

745
01:03:43,822 --> 01:03:46,116
Please step out and open your trunk.

746
01:03:56,126 --> 01:03:58,712
Stay calm, children.

747
01:03:59,963 --> 01:04:01,006
Goodbye, ma'am.

748
01:04:06,970 --> 01:04:08,346
National Guard.

749
01:04:09,931 --> 01:04:12,517
See anything on the road, sir?

750
01:04:15,395 --> 01:04:18,815
National Guard.
Stop the vehicle, please.

751
01:04:18,982 --> 01:04:21,443
- I'm tired of this.
- I said stop.

752
01:04:21,609 --> 01:04:23,361
- You OK, kids?
- Yes.

753
01:04:23,987 --> 01:04:25,447
I left at 4 AM.

754
01:04:25,613 --> 01:04:27,657
We have to check, sir.

755
01:04:27,824 --> 01:04:29,993
Chase Mesrine, don't bother us!

756
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:32,495
Sir, don't argue.

757
01:04:32,996 --> 01:04:34,039
Keep it down.

758
01:04:34,205 --> 01:04:37,000
I got nothing in the back!
See? Nothing.

759
01:04:39,002 --> 01:04:40,295
Don't argue.

760
01:04:45,967 --> 01:04:47,469
You can go.
Go ahead, sir.

761
01:04:47,719 --> 01:04:48,762
You can go.

762
01:05:26,174 --> 01:05:27,717
There's nobody here.

763
01:05:58,414 --> 01:05:59,707
Daniel, come here.

764
01:06:05,088 --> 01:06:06,131
Come here, Daniel.

765
01:06:17,142 --> 01:06:18,142
Here.

766
01:06:23,356 --> 01:06:25,483
For the clothes, and your silence.

767
01:06:26,109 --> 01:06:27,735
All right.

768
01:06:28,403 --> 01:06:30,113
How much you give him?

769
01:06:31,406 --> 01:06:32,406
100,000.

770
01:06:33,825 --> 01:06:35,702
For rags?
What a businessman.

771
01:06:36,786 --> 01:06:37,786
Stop.

772
01:06:38,204 --> 01:06:39,330
You were good.

773
01:07:37,555 --> 01:07:40,141
We're with the mobile guard unit...

774
01:07:43,394 --> 01:07:44,520
There.

775
01:07:45,605 --> 01:07:47,106
We can cross there.

776
01:07:47,690 --> 01:07:48,690
Look.

777
01:07:49,067 --> 01:07:50,485
Here, give me that.

778
01:07:51,027 --> 01:07:52,027
Look.

779
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:53,320
You doubt.

780
01:07:53,947 --> 01:07:54,947
It's obvious.

781
01:07:56,532 --> 01:07:59,118
Look.
You're a doubter.

782
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:02,247
All right?

783
01:08:06,918 --> 01:08:08,336
Keep going.

784
01:08:13,049 --> 01:08:15,343
You can stand here. See?

785
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,470
You don't trust me.

786
01:08:19,013 --> 01:08:20,640
Little deeper here.

787
01:08:22,850 --> 01:08:24,018
Come on.

788
01:08:33,945 --> 01:08:34,988
Here.

789
01:08:37,657 --> 01:08:40,034
This is good, this is good...

790
01:08:40,201 --> 01:08:42,537
Look out. This is no good.

791
01:08:43,371 --> 01:08:45,164
Hang on. Hold this.

792
01:08:45,623 --> 01:08:48,376
- Why?
- I'm going to toss it on the bank.

793
01:08:48,543 --> 01:08:49,919
It's too far.

794
01:08:50,086 --> 01:08:50,753
Trust me.

795
01:08:50,920 --> 01:08:52,797
- Don't.
- Trust me.

796
01:08:54,215 --> 01:08:55,883
It's too far.

797
01:09:00,722 --> 01:09:02,098
Shit!

798
01:09:03,725 --> 01:09:05,143
Look out!

799
01:09:06,978 --> 01:09:08,354
Come here, Francois.

800
01:09:10,815 --> 01:09:12,483
- It's sinking!
- It sank.

801
01:09:17,238 --> 01:09:18,781
That was your share.

802
01:09:19,282 --> 01:09:20,408
Enough.

803
01:09:22,076 --> 01:09:23,745
What's that over there?

804
01:09:23,911 --> 01:09:25,496
Look. What's that?

805
01:09:26,414 --> 01:09:27,874
Oh, shit.

806
01:09:28,624 --> 01:09:29,959
A boat.

807
01:10:00,698 --> 01:10:03,576
<i>Search parties continued
through the night</i>

808
01:10:03,743 --> 01:10:07,997
<i>and new searches were organised
in other regional forests.</i>

809
01:10:08,164 --> 01:10:13,669
<i>Police are now convinced
the fugitives left the target zone</i>

810
01:10:13,836 --> 01:10:17,715
<i>before deployment,

811
01:10:57,338 --> 01:10:58,338
Hello.

812
01:11:09,183 --> 01:11:11,185
So? What will you buy me?

813
01:11:17,692 --> 01:11:18,693
Champagne.

814
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:20,903
The best.
Do you have any Cristal?

815
01:11:21,070 --> 01:11:22,447
Of course.

816
01:11:23,781 --> 01:11:24,824
A bottle.

817
01:11:36,586 --> 01:11:38,254
What's your name?

818
01:11:39,005 --> 01:11:40,131
Sylvia.

819
01:11:41,841 --> 01:11:42,841
And you?

820
01:11:43,801 --> 01:11:45,553
What's your name?

821
01:11:49,265 --> 01:11:50,433
What's my name?

822
01:12:07,241 --> 01:12:09,827
This morning I read my horoscope.

823
01:12:11,245 --> 01:12:12,872
What did it say?

824
01:12:15,374 --> 01:12:17,251
That I would fall in love.

825
01:12:19,253 --> 01:12:21,088
PARIS, JULY 1978

826
01:12:21,422 --> 01:12:23,257
So Isabelle?

827
01:12:23,424 --> 01:12:25,301
You brought my little gift?

828
01:12:36,270 --> 01:12:37,270
Thank you.

829
01:12:37,313 --> 01:12:40,316
- Can we start?
- Sure, Isabelle. Open fire.

830
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:47,740
Why do you do all this?

831
01:13:01,379 --> 01:13:03,297
Because I don't like laws.

832
01:13:03,464 --> 01:13:07,176
I don't like laws and I won't be
a slave to my alarm clock.

833
01:13:07,510 --> 01:13:09,554
I won't dream my life away.

834
01:13:09,929 --> 01:13:15,226
I won't pass every store, thinking
"That'll cost me 10 months work." No.

835
01:13:15,685 --> 01:13:18,104
What do you want from this life?

836
01:13:19,021 --> 01:13:20,273
Glory? Money?

837
01:13:21,023 --> 01:13:22,108
What a question.

838
01:13:22,441 --> 01:13:24,443
Money, money and more money.

839
01:13:24,694 --> 01:13:27,989
We live in a world of exploiters.
But I exploit no one.

840
01:13:28,364 --> 01:13:29,365
What do I do?

841
01:13:30,825 --> 01:13:33,369
Look for money where it is.
In the banks.

842
01:13:35,496 --> 01:13:37,915
And politics? Are you right or left?

843
01:13:38,958 --> 01:13:39,667
Neither!

844
01:13:39,834 --> 01:13:43,212
It's all corrupt.
I don't need to tell you that.

845
01:13:43,379 --> 01:13:46,424
I can't trust the mind
of a politician.

846
01:13:46,924 --> 01:13:49,468
Would you say you're a dangerous man?

847
01:13:52,138 --> 01:13:53,264
Dangerous?

848
01:13:53,848 --> 01:13:55,391
What do you think?

849
01:13:56,058 --> 01:13:57,058
Yeah, maybe.

850
01:13:58,686 --> 01:13:59,687
I don't know.

851
01:14:00,688 --> 01:14:02,356
Why do you say that?

852
01:14:03,566 --> 01:14:05,818
Dangerous. That all depends.

853
01:14:06,444 --> 01:14:09,155
With armed cops, yes.
I have no limits then.

854
01:14:10,072 --> 01:14:11,532
Come on, shoot!

855
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:14,493
Good one. That's a keeper.

856
01:14:16,454 --> 01:14:17,913
Dangerous...

857
01:14:20,499 --> 01:14:21,792
Maybe.

858
01:14:22,376 --> 01:14:23,794
Maybe I am.

859
01:14:24,378 --> 01:14:27,256
How do you think you'll age,
and die?

860
01:14:29,925 --> 01:14:33,262
Frankly, I don't think
I'll live to be very old.

861
01:14:33,846 --> 01:14:36,474
They'll shoot me down. I'll die.

862
01:14:36,891 --> 01:14:38,934
It's logical. It's the outcome.

863
01:14:39,101 --> 01:14:40,102
And anyway.

864
01:14:40,728 --> 01:14:43,981
A man who's been in an MSA,
a Maximum Security Area,

865
01:14:44,148 --> 01:14:45,274
has every right.

866
01:14:45,441 --> 01:14:47,443
So I have every right.

867
01:14:47,610 --> 01:14:48,903
Isn't that a little dark?

868
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:52,365
Do you have plans?

869
01:14:52,531 --> 01:14:54,241
Lots.
Always lots of plans.

870
01:14:55,534 --> 01:14:56,786
I'm going to close the MSA's.

871
01:14:56,952 --> 01:14:59,205
I did five years there. Know what that is?

872
01:14:59,372 --> 01:15:00,956
Five years in an MSA?

873
01:15:01,123 --> 01:15:03,584
I'm going to spring the guys inside.

874
01:15:03,751 --> 01:15:06,379
I've seen men cut down,
torn apart, broken.

875
01:15:06,545 --> 01:15:10,424
And if Mr Alain Peyreffite of the DOJ
doesn't get it,

876
01:15:10,591 --> 01:15:12,551
I'm a nitroglycerin specialist!

877
01:15:13,719 --> 01:15:15,888
I'll rub out judges if necessary-.

878
01:15:16,055 --> 01:15:18,557
Want a French Baader-Meinhof gang?

879
01:15:18,724 --> 01:15:21,894
Do they want the Red Brigades?
They better wonder.

880
01:15:22,061 --> 01:15:26,899
If I have to go train
with Palestinians, then I will.

881
01:15:27,066 --> 01:15:28,651
We'll blow it all up.

882
01:15:28,818 --> 01:15:30,361
Something to drink? Coffee?

883
01:15:31,237 --> 01:15:32,279
With pleasure.

884
01:15:32,446 --> 01:15:33,447
Sugar?

885
01:16:14,697 --> 01:16:16,365
You're in Paris Match.

886
01:16:16,532 --> 01:16:17,867
It's about time.

887
01:16:18,033 --> 01:16:19,033
Here.

888
01:16:21,579 --> 01:16:24,123
Today's menu - leg of lamb!

889
01:16:25,166 --> 01:16:29,044
I don't know about you.
I'm sick of Brit food.

890
01:16:36,927 --> 01:16:39,722
"If I have to train
with Palestinians, I will."

891
01:16:41,307 --> 01:16:45,478
"if Peyreffite refuses, I'll unleash
violence worse than Baader."

892
01:16:46,187 --> 01:16:47,229
I said that.

893
01:16:47,646 --> 01:16:48,646
And I Will.

894
01:16:48,981 --> 01:16:51,442
"I'm a nitroglycerin specialist."

895
01:16:51,609 --> 01:16:52,735
Keep going.

896
01:16:53,819 --> 01:16:57,615
"...rub out judges if necessary."
What is this bullshit?

897
01:16:59,867 --> 01:17:02,286
It's not bullshit, it's revolution.

898
01:17:02,661 --> 01:17:04,497
- What?
- Revolution.

899
01:17:04,663 --> 01:17:08,709
We're crooks, not wild-eyed idealists.
We don't try to break the system.

900
01:17:09,502 --> 01:17:13,255
See that, baby?
Typical small-fry.

901
01:17:14,256 --> 01:17:15,758
Because he's small,

902
01:17:15,925 --> 01:17:17,218
he thinks small.

903
01:17:20,846 --> 01:17:22,681
I don't act high and mighty.

904
01:17:23,557 --> 01:17:26,393
I don't have a vendetta
with the state.

905
01:17:28,479 --> 01:17:29,647
Fine,

906
01:17:29,814 --> 01:17:32,566
but don't ask me
to autograph your copy.

907
01:17:36,028 --> 01:17:37,905
Wipe your ass with it.

908
01:17:38,155 --> 01:17:39,573
Come on.

909
01:17:40,574 --> 01:17:42,451
Francois, come and eat.

910
01:17:42,910 --> 01:17:44,203
I don't work like this.

911
01:17:44,370 --> 01:17:46,163
It's using the press.

912
01:17:47,456 --> 01:17:48,456
That's all.

913
01:17:48,582 --> 01:17:49,959
We better talk this out.

914
01:17:50,125 --> 01:17:52,753
If you say so. But over dinner.

915
01:17:53,337 --> 01:17:54,547
Come on.

916
01:17:56,257 --> 01:17:58,175
Bring the defendants in.

917
01:18:01,470 --> 01:18:04,390
I got us a golden opportunity.
Listen.

918
01:18:05,683 --> 01:18:07,893
We're going to kidnap a millionaire.

919
01:18:10,938 --> 01:18:12,189
What for?

920
01:18:12,356 --> 01:18:14,024
What kind of question is that?

921
01:18:15,025 --> 01:18:16,360
To take his money.

922
01:18:16,986 --> 01:18:19,071
And believe me,

923
01:18:19,405 --> 01:18:21,740
the one I found is really something.

924
01:18:22,533 --> 01:18:23,534
No one will cry.

925
01:18:23,701 --> 01:18:25,452
An old piece of shit

926
01:18:25,619 --> 01:18:27,162
who rents slum apartments.

927
01:18:28,914 --> 01:18:31,208
The real thing, trust me.

928
01:18:32,126 --> 01:18:33,168
Wait.

929
01:18:33,711 --> 01:18:36,088
After that,
you know what we do?

930
01:18:36,714 --> 01:18:38,674
We get some bazookas,

931
01:18:39,008 --> 01:18:40,009
Francois,

932
01:18:40,426 --> 01:18:42,553
we go after the MSA's.

933
01:18:47,433 --> 01:18:51,687
Listen, Jacques.
Attack the MSA's, why not?

934
01:18:52,229 --> 01:18:54,398
But then where do you lead me?

935
01:18:54,565 --> 01:18:56,066
Oh, boy. After that...

936
01:18:56,233 --> 01:18:58,736
The truth is you'll never stop.

937
01:18:59,194 --> 01:19:01,697
You want to tear the system down.

938
01:19:01,864 --> 01:19:03,824
I want it to stand
so I can milk it.

939
01:19:07,202 --> 01:19:11,206
You're a spinning top.
Worst part is, you don't realise it.

940
01:19:14,668 --> 01:19:15,668
A top?

941
01:19:16,086 --> 01:19:17,129
A top.

942
01:19:17,296 --> 01:19:19,214
What is that expression?

943
01:19:19,381 --> 01:19:21,175
I don't know tops.

944
01:19:24,178 --> 01:19:27,890
SARTHE, JUNE 1979

945
01:19:41,403 --> 01:19:43,948
Is Mr Lefévre in, please?

946
01:19:44,657 --> 01:19:46,241
I'm his son. And you?

947
01:19:50,746 --> 01:19:53,999
Commissaire Vaugier, police.
Do you mind?

948
01:20:01,799 --> 01:20:02,967
What's this about?

949
01:20:03,634 --> 01:20:07,888
Your father owns some buildings.
We want to ask him about that.

950
01:20:12,351 --> 01:20:14,895
- I'll get him.
- Thank you.

951
01:20:36,917 --> 01:20:39,628
How can I help you, gentlemen?

952
01:20:39,795 --> 01:20:44,174
Some of your tenants filed
a complaint for poor conditions.

953
01:20:44,466 --> 01:20:47,302
We need you
to come down to the station.

954
01:20:47,469 --> 01:20:51,181
- Can't you do it here?
- How would that look?

955
01:20:51,473 --> 01:20:53,726
All right, let's go.

956
01:20:55,185 --> 01:20:57,062
It shouldn't take long.

957
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:00,941
Tell Charles to get the car.

958
01:21:01,108 --> 01:21:03,944
No need. We have a vehicle.

959
01:21:04,111 --> 01:21:06,905
We'll bring you back when it's over.

960
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:09,950
Fine, then let's go.

961
01:21:11,660 --> 01:21:13,495
Thanks for your cooperation.

962
01:21:22,296 --> 01:21:23,797
As of now,

963
01:21:24,506 --> 01:21:27,718
you're in the custody
of the Palestine Liberation Front.

964
01:21:29,011 --> 01:21:30,011
Palestine?

965
01:21:31,555 --> 01:21:33,640
What's that got to do with me?

966
01:21:34,975 --> 01:21:37,519
I rent apartments in Paris.

967
01:21:38,228 --> 01:21:39,480
I'm not even Jewish.

968
01:21:40,147 --> 01:21:41,147
No problem.

969
01:21:43,776 --> 01:21:46,779
You'll give it up for me.
Jacques Mesrine.

970
01:21:49,865 --> 01:21:50,865
Mesrine?

971
01:21:55,871 --> 01:21:57,289
Will you keep me long?

972
01:22:04,546 --> 01:22:08,008
Unless you pay the piper,
you can't go home.

973
01:22:10,427 --> 01:22:11,553
How much you want?

974
01:22:12,054 --> 01:22:13,138
10 million. Cash.

975
01:22:19,603 --> 01:22:21,438
No, that's too much.

976
01:22:21,814 --> 01:22:23,107
At that price,

977
01:22:23,315 --> 01:22:25,984
I'm 82, there's no point.

978
01:22:26,151 --> 01:22:27,277
Just kill me now.

979
01:22:35,953 --> 01:22:37,371
You'll give us eight.

980
01:22:39,456 --> 01:22:40,791
What do you mean, no?

981
01:22:44,002 --> 01:22:46,296
You don't decide. Stupid bastard.

982
01:22:48,549 --> 01:22:50,968
- Give me seven and that's final.
- No!

983
01:22:51,969 --> 01:22:53,887
How much were you thinking?

984
01:22:56,306 --> 01:22:57,432
Six,

985
01:22:58,267 --> 01:22:59,434
in four payments.

986
01:23:00,018 --> 01:23:01,478
Four payments?

987
01:23:06,108 --> 01:23:07,693
First, it's three payments.

988
01:23:07,985 --> 01:23:11,947
And you fuck with us,
I'll kill you for free. All at once.

989
01:23:12,114 --> 01:23:13,114
Got that?

990
01:23:13,991 --> 01:23:14,658
Yes.

991
01:23:14,825 --> 01:23:15,825
Got that?

992
01:23:16,451 --> 01:23:18,120
Yes, yes.

993
01:23:20,581 --> 01:23:22,166
This guy's too much.

994
01:23:24,418 --> 01:23:27,379
Good food, excellent cognac.
In the end,

995
01:23:27,713 --> 01:23:30,549
we're not so different, Mr Mesrine.

996
01:23:30,716 --> 01:23:32,801
We like fine things.

997
01:23:33,552 --> 01:23:35,429
And if, to get them,

998
01:23:35,596 --> 01:23:40,309
one must extort money
from an honest worker,

999
01:23:41,435 --> 01:23:43,020
Why not?

1000
01:23:43,896 --> 01:23:46,481
That's bullshit.
We're totally different.

1001
01:23:46,648 --> 01:23:48,025
You're an exploiter.

1002
01:23:48,650 --> 01:23:50,027
I'm a revolutionary.

1003
01:23:50,194 --> 01:23:51,820
Not the same thing.

1004
01:23:53,864 --> 01:23:57,910
Mr Mesrine, know how to tell
a revolutionary from a gangster?

1005
01:23:58,785 --> 01:24:00,412
What is this, a riddle?

1006
01:24:00,996 --> 01:24:01,996
A revolutionary

1007
01:24:02,122 --> 01:24:05,292
would have
put a bullet in my head

1008
01:24:05,918 --> 01:24:09,713
and left my corpse
in the trunk of a car.

1009
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:12,716
And never asked for a cent.

1010
01:24:12,883 --> 01:24:16,929
On the other hand,
a gangster asks for ransom,

1011
01:24:17,095 --> 01:24:20,474
picks up his money
and frees me.

1012
01:24:21,183 --> 01:24:22,726
That's what you'll do.

1013
01:24:23,101 --> 01:24:24,478
That is good.

1014
01:24:25,479 --> 01:24:27,856
There's a third possibility.

1015
01:24:29,775 --> 01:24:34,279
I get the money, put a bullet in you,
toss you in the trunk.

1016
01:24:34,446 --> 01:24:35,906
Never thought of that?

1017
01:24:36,073 --> 01:24:38,575
Then all that stuff in the papers,

1018
01:24:38,742 --> 01:24:40,953
"Mesrine, the honest bandit,

1019
01:24:41,745 --> 01:24:43,038
whose word is his bond,"

1020
01:24:43,455 --> 01:24:45,666
that's all bullshit?

1021
01:24:48,877 --> 01:24:52,839
<i>In Belgium, the arrest of Mesrine's
co-escapee, Francois Besse,</i>

1022
01:24:53,006 --> 01:24:55,759
<i>who teamed up with Mesrine</i>

1023
01:24:55,926 --> 01:24:58,011
<i>on several hold-ups since then.</i>

1024
01:24:58,178 --> 01:25:03,058
<i>Recently, Besse had parted company
with public enemy number one.</i>

1025
01:25:03,558 --> 01:25:08,772
<i>In the Brussels suburbs
police apprehended him with three others...</i>

1026
01:25:08,939 --> 01:25:09,648
Poor Francois.

1027
01:25:09,815 --> 01:25:14,486
<i>Tipped by French anti-gang police,
the Belgians...</i>

1028
01:25:14,945 --> 01:25:18,198
Nabbed by Belgian police.
You got to be really stupid.

1029
01:25:23,036 --> 01:25:25,622
If I know him, he won't be in long.

1030
01:25:26,748 --> 01:25:27,833
All right.

1031
01:25:29,584 --> 01:25:31,837
<i>Lapin chasseur,</i> Mr Jacques style!

1032
01:25:32,004 --> 01:25:33,630
Let's eat.

1033
01:25:41,263 --> 01:25:43,181
Yeah. Nothing's happening.

1034
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:44,808
Let me see.

1035
01:25:49,855 --> 01:25:51,064
It's been an hour.

1036
01:25:51,231 --> 01:25:52,816
When do we go and get the money?

1037
01:25:53,108 --> 01:25:54,443
Let him simmer.

1038
01:25:54,609 --> 01:25:57,487
Always let them simmer.
You never know.

1039
01:26:37,277 --> 01:26:39,821
What's that car
stopping near Lefévre?

1040
01:26:40,447 --> 01:26:41,447
Let me see.

1041
01:26:46,787 --> 01:26:48,121
That prick.

1042
01:26:48,330 --> 01:26:49,623
I told you.

1043
01:26:49,873 --> 01:26:52,667
That's fuzz.
Fucking shit-eating cops.

1044
01:26:54,086 --> 01:26:55,545
Watch this.

1045
01:26:56,922 --> 01:26:58,507
We'll test their windshield.

1046
01:27:01,051 --> 01:27:02,511
Show up with cops?

1047
01:27:12,479 --> 01:27:16,608
Try to double-cross me?
I'll make it worth your while.

1048
01:27:18,777 --> 01:27:19,777
Scumbag.

1049
01:27:21,822 --> 01:27:23,615
Holding pretty good.

1050
01:27:33,291 --> 01:27:34,626
Time to go.

1051
01:27:57,774 --> 01:28:00,318
Your son betrayed me!
There were cops everywhere!

1052
01:28:05,615 --> 01:28:08,118
I swear it won't happen again.

1053
01:28:15,834 --> 01:28:18,044
It better not. For your sake!

1054
01:28:19,004 --> 01:28:20,338
I'm telling you.

1055
01:28:37,898 --> 01:28:39,107
So!

1056
01:28:40,442 --> 01:28:42,110
Good news and better news.

1057
01:28:43,778 --> 01:28:47,324
Grandpa's going home soon,

1058
01:28:47,491 --> 01:28:48,491
because sonny boy

1059
01:28:49,784 --> 01:28:51,328
made the first payment.

1060
01:28:52,871 --> 01:28:55,165
And the better news, look:

1061
01:28:56,291 --> 01:28:59,127
Come on, smile.
I'm taking a picture. Hold this.

1062
01:29:00,629 --> 01:29:01,671
It's almost over.

1063
01:29:02,881 --> 01:29:04,716
Smile and say cheese.

1064
01:29:04,883 --> 01:29:06,760
BESSE:
A "MESRINE-STYLE" ESCAPE

1065
01:29:14,017 --> 01:29:15,060
Here.

1066
01:29:17,187 --> 01:29:20,106
Really. 600 grand.
Isn't life wonderful?

1067
01:29:33,453 --> 01:29:34,496
Hello.

1068
01:29:34,871 --> 01:29:37,541
Welcome to BMW.
Let me show you...

1069
01:29:37,707 --> 01:29:38,959
Enough. I want that.

1070
01:29:39,793 --> 01:29:41,044
Right away, sir.

1071
01:30:00,522 --> 01:30:03,066
<i>Not the good...
Really not the good.</i>

1072
01:30:06,528 --> 01:30:08,071
<i>Nor the bad</i>

1073
01:30:08,822 --> 01:30:11,533
<i>I don't give a crap!</i>

1074
01:30:15,203 --> 01:30:16,371
Look at this baby.

1075
01:30:21,543 --> 01:30:23,378
Go ahead, sir!

1076
01:30:23,878 --> 01:30:25,797
Look, another out-of-towner.

1077
01:30:26,631 --> 01:30:28,425
Where's the police?

1078
01:30:35,682 --> 01:30:36,975
There we are!

1079
01:31:03,543 --> 01:31:04,543
Try that one.

1080
01:31:06,796 --> 01:31:07,796
Beautiful!

1081
01:31:11,134 --> 01:31:12,134
How much?

1082
01:31:20,894 --> 01:31:22,937
You're under arrest.

1083
01:31:24,189 --> 01:31:26,024
You like it, Fripouille?

1084
01:31:28,568 --> 01:31:29,568
Gorgeous.

1085
01:31:39,454 --> 01:31:41,081
<i>Mesrine has thought of one thing</i>

1086
01:31:41,247 --> 01:31:43,458
<i>since his 20-year sentence
a year ago</i>

1087
01:31:43,625 --> 01:31:45,543
<i>in May, 1977. Escape.</i>

1088
01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:50,215
<i>But he'll probably be re-captured.
He can't not talk,</i>

1089
01:31:50,382 --> 01:31:55,261
<i>not justify his status
as public enemy number one.</i>

1090
01:31:55,679 --> 01:31:58,973
PARIS, AUGUST 1979

1091
01:32:15,782 --> 01:32:16,782
Charlie.

1092
01:32:19,869 --> 01:32:22,372
Charlie Bauer, the invisible man.

1093
01:32:23,540 --> 01:32:25,417
You're a hard man to see.

1094
01:32:25,583 --> 01:32:28,545
Let's say I'm not as free as you are.

1095
01:32:28,712 --> 01:32:32,507
I have a group,
comrades I answer to.

1096
01:32:32,674 --> 01:32:35,051
Yeah, right. I forgot.

1097
01:32:35,635 --> 01:32:37,470
Your far-left comrades

1098
01:32:37,804 --> 01:32:41,891
who tell you how to drink, eat,
who you can see?

1099
01:32:42,058 --> 01:32:45,186
You think, alone,
you can smash the system?

1100
01:32:45,562 --> 01:32:46,563
I don't think.

1101
01:32:46,730 --> 01:32:48,440
I know I'm doing it.

1102
01:32:49,482 --> 01:32:50,734
You seen the papers?

1103
01:32:50,900 --> 01:32:52,736
Have you read my book?

1104
01:32:53,945 --> 01:32:55,572
Part of it.

1105
01:32:56,364 --> 01:32:58,366
I didn't like all I read.

1106
01:33:00,326 --> 01:33:02,954
It's got nothing to do
with who I am

1107
01:33:03,121 --> 01:33:04,289
and what I'm about.

1108
01:33:04,748 --> 01:33:07,917
I don't mind saying
if we had met in Algeria,

1109
01:33:08,084 --> 01:33:10,378
it wouldn't have been side-by-side,
but face-to-face,

1110
01:33:10,545 --> 01:33:11,755
gun in hand.

1111
01:33:13,131 --> 01:33:14,299
I know that.

1112
01:33:15,467 --> 01:33:16,718
I'd have killed you.

1113
01:33:17,177 --> 01:33:21,431
You better not have missed.
We have nothing to prove...

1114
01:33:31,024 --> 01:33:33,818
I'm going home
to my little family.

1115
01:33:34,277 --> 01:33:36,196
But keep in touch.

1116
01:33:45,997 --> 01:33:48,958
If you need anything, don't hesitate.

1117
01:33:49,125 --> 01:33:51,044
Sooner than you think.

1118
01:33:51,294 --> 01:33:52,462
My friend.

1119
01:34:00,261 --> 01:34:01,846
What is that behaviour?

1120
01:34:04,682 --> 01:34:06,017
What is that?

1121
01:34:06,684 --> 01:34:07,769
What behaviour?

1122
01:34:07,936 --> 01:34:10,230
Strutting your crumpet all over.

1123
01:34:18,196 --> 01:34:21,699
Why do I bother?
You're just a piece of ass.

1124
01:34:21,866 --> 01:34:22,866
What?

1125
01:34:24,494 --> 01:34:27,163
- Remember where I picked you up?
- What?

1126
01:34:27,664 --> 01:34:29,123
Nobody picks me up!

1127
01:34:29,791 --> 01:34:31,709
Unless you got a little...

1128
01:34:32,418 --> 01:34:34,045
Nobody picks me up.

1129
01:34:34,212 --> 01:34:35,380
Nobody buys me.

1130
01:34:35,547 --> 01:34:38,007
If you respected me,
you wouldn't say that.

1131
01:34:38,174 --> 01:34:39,174
Respect?

1132
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:41,469
You talking to me about respect?

1133
01:34:42,512 --> 01:34:46,182
After you pull that
girlie shit with my friend?

1134
01:34:46,349 --> 01:34:47,349
What friend?

1135
01:34:48,351 --> 01:34:51,688
Listen, he was in an MSA.
Like me.

1136
01:34:51,855 --> 01:34:54,148
That's enough to know who he is.

1137
01:34:59,237 --> 01:35:01,155
Francois was your friend.

1138
01:35:01,322 --> 01:35:02,115
But you...

1139
01:35:02,282 --> 01:35:06,202
you want the last word,
so you always wind up alone.

1140
01:35:07,287 --> 01:35:09,914
And that's how you'll end up, Mesrine.

1141
01:35:10,081 --> 01:35:11,541
Alone.

1142
01:35:13,835 --> 01:35:15,295
Why?

1143
01:35:16,254 --> 01:35:18,631
You're going to leave me? That it?

1144
01:35:20,633 --> 01:35:22,343
Why do you say that?

1145
01:35:23,887 --> 01:35:25,305
What's the matter?

1146
01:35:26,347 --> 01:35:28,141
You don't love me any more?

1147
01:35:29,183 --> 01:35:31,102
I want us to leave this place.

1148
01:35:33,021 --> 01:35:35,315
- We'll leave.
- You're lying.

1149
01:35:35,481 --> 01:35:38,026
- We will.
- You lie. We will not.

1150
01:35:38,192 --> 01:35:40,737
You'll get yourself killed, Mesrine.

1151
01:35:40,904 --> 01:35:43,489
No. No one's going to die.

1152
01:35:43,656 --> 01:35:44,490
Promise me.

1153
01:35:44,657 --> 01:35:45,491
I promise.

1154
01:35:45,658 --> 01:35:47,327
Promise me again.

1155
01:36:25,490 --> 01:36:26,658
My mummy!

1156
01:36:26,824 --> 01:36:28,993
That's not Mummy.
Show them in, hon?

1157
01:36:33,873 --> 01:36:38,419
A land of human rights, where humans
are resigned, docile, kneeling.

1158
01:36:39,712 --> 01:36:43,841
True. Then they throw you in a hole,
make you a beast or a corpse.

1159
01:36:44,133 --> 01:36:47,345
We must tear down this repressive,
regressive system,

1160
01:36:47,512 --> 01:36:50,306
that continues
even beyond sentencing.

1161
01:36:50,473 --> 01:36:51,265
As you know,

1162
01:36:51,432 --> 01:36:54,978
compared to the MSA,
the guillotine is almost a favour!

1163
01:36:57,146 --> 01:36:59,482
One, tear down the prison walls.

1164
01:37:00,108 --> 01:37:02,735
Two, liberate our comrades inside.

1165
01:37:02,986 --> 01:37:05,071
Three, raise an army with them.

1166
01:37:05,321 --> 01:37:07,323
You want to beat the system?

1167
01:37:07,490 --> 01:37:09,534
Hit them in the wallet.

1168
01:37:09,701 --> 01:37:11,494
Rob banks.
That's what I do.

1169
01:37:11,661 --> 01:37:14,539
Banks have always got hit.
They still stand.

1170
01:37:14,706 --> 01:37:16,207
Want to know why?

1171
01:37:16,374 --> 01:37:18,793
What do you do with the money?

1172
01:37:18,960 --> 01:37:22,755
Besides buying jewellery for Sylvia
and big cars for yourself?

1173
01:37:22,922 --> 01:37:27,051
Friend, you don't destroy capital.
You flatter it.

1174
01:37:31,556 --> 01:37:34,058
I've escaped four times. That's not bad.

1175
01:37:34,308 --> 01:37:36,561
How many times have they caught you?

1176
01:37:36,728 --> 01:37:38,354
Ever think of that?

1177
01:37:38,521 --> 01:37:39,605
It won't happen again.

1178
01:37:40,565 --> 01:37:42,567
Now they have no choice.

1179
01:37:42,734 --> 01:37:44,360
They have to shoot me down.

1180
01:37:44,819 --> 01:37:46,487
At least that way,

1181
01:37:46,863 --> 01:37:48,948
I die this side of the wall.

1182
01:37:52,118 --> 01:37:53,661
Kitty!

1183
01:37:56,664 --> 01:37:58,499
Can't have a conversation.

1184
01:37:59,292 --> 01:38:00,543
She busts my balls.

1185
01:38:01,919 --> 01:38:03,379
On the other hand...

1186
01:38:14,307 --> 01:38:15,307
What?

1187
01:38:15,433 --> 01:38:18,603
I quit that shit.
Bad for your health.

1188
01:38:19,395 --> 01:38:21,689
You think you'll die of that?

1189
01:38:23,191 --> 01:38:24,776
You never know.

1190
01:38:41,542 --> 01:38:43,211
Tell me you're happy.

1191
01:38:47,548 --> 01:38:49,592
I want us to leave.

1192
01:38:50,176 --> 01:38:52,386
While we still have some money.

1193
01:38:54,722 --> 01:38:56,682
We'll stay a little while longer.

1194
01:38:56,849 --> 01:38:58,851
Then we'll leave the country.

1195
01:39:01,354 --> 01:39:03,606
In the meantime, don't worry.

1196
01:39:04,190 --> 01:39:08,402
As long as we're together,
nothing can happen to us.

1197
01:39:15,284 --> 01:39:16,702
You're beautiful.

1198
01:39:19,163 --> 01:39:20,414
I love you.

1199
01:39:21,874 --> 01:39:23,209
So do I.

1200
01:39:31,884 --> 01:39:33,386
I think it's Charlie.

1201
01:39:49,569 --> 01:39:50,611
You know Dallier?

1202
01:39:51,404 --> 01:39:52,572
Jacques Dallier?

1203
01:39:53,489 --> 01:39:55,116
A fascist asshole.

1204
01:39:55,867 --> 01:39:58,870
Converted hack,
working for a motherfucking rag,

1205
01:39:59,036 --> 01:40:00,913
but who still snitches for the cops.

1206
01:40:01,539 --> 01:40:02,874
A scumbag.

1207
01:40:04,542 --> 01:40:05,710
Read this.

1208
01:40:06,252 --> 01:40:07,086
Read it!

1209
01:40:07,253 --> 01:40:08,462
Read that!

1210
01:40:10,089 --> 01:40:11,382
"Mesrine,

1211
01:40:12,592 --> 01:40:14,594
the Dishonourable Bandit...

1212
01:40:15,052 --> 01:40:16,512
Me!

1213
01:40:19,182 --> 01:40:22,268
...who betrays his friends
and doesn't keep his word."

1214
01:40:22,435 --> 01:40:23,728
Cocksucker.

1215
01:40:30,359 --> 01:40:32,445
What are you going to do?

1216
01:41:36,008 --> 01:41:37,677
Come on, let's go.

1217
01:42:37,820 --> 01:42:38,820
Get in.

1218
01:43:00,384 --> 01:43:01,719
Tell me, Dallier,

1219
01:43:03,137 --> 01:43:06,682
has your paper, <i>Minute,</i>
always been for the MSA's?

1220
01:43:06,849 --> 01:43:08,851
<i>Minute</i> is too extreme. Stinks.

1221
01:43:09,310 --> 01:43:12,146
With this scoop,
I can afford to live on an island.

1222
01:43:12,730 --> 01:43:16,442
An island? What's wrong
with the French countryside?

1223
01:43:16,942 --> 01:43:18,277
France?

1224
01:43:20,112 --> 01:43:22,281
She used to be a great lady.

1225
01:43:22,490 --> 01:43:24,784
Then, in '40, what does she do?

1226
01:43:24,950 --> 01:43:26,410
Lies down for Hitler.

1227
01:43:26,577 --> 01:43:28,454
In '60, she kneels for Arabs.

1228
01:43:29,330 --> 01:43:31,499
Gave Algeria to the natives. Crap!

1229
01:43:31,665 --> 01:43:34,126
Algeria doesn't belong to Algerians?

1230
01:43:34,543 --> 01:43:36,295
And America to the Indians?

1231
01:43:37,713 --> 01:43:40,674
Who built a nation?
The white man or the savage?

1232
01:43:44,095 --> 01:43:48,099
Dallier, you were a cop.
What do you think of the police?

1233
01:43:48,349 --> 01:43:49,683
Assholes.

1234
01:43:50,184 --> 01:43:52,186
A bunch of bunglers.

1235
01:43:52,645 --> 01:43:55,272
They shit in their pants over you.

1236
01:43:55,481 --> 01:43:58,526
The "Great Jacques" and "Mesrine".
Pathetic.

1237
01:44:00,111 --> 01:44:03,280
The police in October '61,
that was something.

1238
01:44:03,447 --> 01:44:05,658
They straightened the Arabs out.

1239
01:44:06,117 --> 01:44:08,369
But back then they had Papon.

1240
01:44:09,370 --> 01:44:11,163
Good boss, Papon.

1241
01:44:19,296 --> 01:44:21,966
If I were you,
I'd watch out for Broussard.

1242
01:44:22,425 --> 01:44:24,510
He's working on your daughter.

1243
01:44:25,386 --> 01:44:28,222
Yeah? You think he'd stoop to that?

1244
01:44:28,389 --> 01:44:31,559
I should know
what kind of shit they pull.

1245
01:44:32,351 --> 01:44:33,351
That's for sure.

1246
01:44:34,937 --> 01:44:38,774
What about me?
What are their plans, do you know?

1247
01:44:39,650 --> 01:44:41,193
To rub you out.

1248
01:44:43,821 --> 01:44:45,156
No question about it.

1249
01:45:11,056 --> 01:45:12,056
Wait.

1250
01:45:45,382 --> 01:45:46,382
Gum?

1251
01:46:07,571 --> 01:46:09,073
Kalashnikov. Good weapon.

1252
01:46:13,327 --> 01:46:14,327
Let's go.

1253
01:46:20,918 --> 01:46:22,336
Take this.

1254
01:46:25,631 --> 01:46:26,882
Walk.

1255
01:46:44,191 --> 01:46:45,191
Back there.

1256
01:46:49,238 --> 01:46:50,781
Move it.

1257
01:47:17,474 --> 01:47:19,435
Can we start the interview?

1258
01:47:24,481 --> 01:47:28,777
I managed to meet Jacques Mesrine,
who's agreed to answer questions.

1259
01:47:30,070 --> 01:47:32,823
- Are you Jacques Mesrine?
- So I'm told.

1260
01:47:33,407 --> 01:47:35,117
You are Jacques Mesrine?

1261
01:47:39,330 --> 01:47:41,498
I don't know what you've been told.

1262
01:47:41,665 --> 01:47:43,459
There's fear in your eyes.

1263
01:47:44,376 --> 01:47:46,670
- You scared?
- No, I'm not.

1264
01:47:50,090 --> 01:47:51,216
You look uneasy.

1265
01:47:56,597 --> 01:47:57,973
I'm just surprised.

1266
01:47:58,140 --> 01:48:01,060
About what?
Your paper wanted to see me, right?

1267
01:48:03,312 --> 01:48:05,439
So you kidnapped Lefévre?

1268
01:48:09,276 --> 01:48:10,653
Put the mike down.

1269
01:48:10,819 --> 01:48:11,819
Do what?

1270
01:48:12,279 --> 01:48:14,114
Put it down. Strip.

1271
01:48:14,281 --> 01:48:15,407
Your clothes!

1272
01:48:16,742 --> 01:48:17,742
Want a scoop?

1273
01:48:17,951 --> 01:48:18,951
Here it is.

1274
01:48:19,370 --> 01:48:20,829
Let's make it believable.

1275
01:48:20,996 --> 01:48:23,957
Let's go, strip!
Drop those trousers.

1276
01:48:24,541 --> 01:48:26,794
So they know you sweat for it.

1277
01:48:27,544 --> 01:48:30,422
People can't think you're with us.

1278
01:48:30,589 --> 01:48:31,840
Because you're not.

1279
01:48:32,007 --> 01:48:33,425
But you said...

1280
01:48:33,884 --> 01:48:35,010
Let's go.

1281
01:48:38,138 --> 01:48:39,348
You want a scoop?

1282
01:48:39,515 --> 01:48:41,100
What are you going to do?

1283
01:48:41,809 --> 01:48:43,560
Let's handcuff you.

1284
01:48:45,521 --> 01:48:46,772
So it's more realistic.

1285
01:48:47,940 --> 01:48:49,274
You'll look cute.

1286
01:48:49,441 --> 01:48:50,192
Hands.

1287
01:48:50,359 --> 01:48:51,360
Set the stage.

1288
01:48:52,277 --> 01:48:53,277
"Bu-t, but"...

1289
01:48:53,570 --> 01:48:54,570
Shut up!

1290
01:48:56,323 --> 01:48:57,533
Shut up!

1291
01:48:59,201 --> 01:49:00,285
Now let me explain.

1292
01:49:00,452 --> 01:49:03,163
It's no longer
Dallier interviews Mesrine.

1293
01:49:04,665 --> 01:49:07,835
It's Mesrine interviews Dallier.

1294
01:49:09,086 --> 01:49:10,129
Wait, I...

1295
01:49:10,921 --> 01:49:13,048
- What's your name?
- Wait.

1296
01:49:15,467 --> 01:49:17,636
What's your name? What's your name?

1297
01:49:17,803 --> 01:49:19,763
- Jacques Dallier.
- That's right.

1298
01:49:21,014 --> 01:49:23,600
That's a little faggot name.

1299
01:49:23,851 --> 01:49:24,851
Faggot!

1300
01:49:28,522 --> 01:49:31,191
What's the rag you work for?
Tell me!

1301
01:49:31,358 --> 01:49:33,110
<i>Minute.</i>

1302
01:49:33,277 --> 01:49:35,028
That's right, Minute.

1303
01:49:35,195 --> 01:49:39,575
What is that?
Isn't that a fascist paper?

1304
01:49:42,828 --> 01:49:46,623
You wrote an article in there
about me? Was that you?

1305
01:49:46,790 --> 01:49:47,458
Not me.

1306
01:49:47,624 --> 01:49:49,835
At least be honest. It's better.

1307
01:49:51,378 --> 01:49:52,838
It was you!

1308
01:49:53,422 --> 01:49:55,424
You wrote an article about me.

1309
01:50:00,846 --> 01:50:02,389
Faggot, was it you?

1310
01:50:02,973 --> 01:50:05,184
I'm not straight with my partners?

1311
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:10,272
You said I'm not straight?

1312
01:50:10,439 --> 01:50:11,565
You soil my reputation?

1313
01:50:15,778 --> 01:50:18,822
My partners are right there.
Ask them.

1314
01:50:19,448 --> 01:50:20,448
Faggot!

1315
01:50:23,535 --> 01:50:25,704
Shitass reporters who soil my reputation,

1316
01:50:26,079 --> 01:50:28,874
I pump them... full of lead!
Lead!

1317
01:50:42,221 --> 01:50:45,766
I'm going to show you
what we do in Algeria.

1318
01:50:46,767 --> 01:50:48,268
You're going to croak.

1319
01:50:48,435 --> 01:50:49,686
Stop!

1320
01:50:49,853 --> 01:50:50,687
Not that.

1321
01:50:50,854 --> 01:50:52,314
We're not fascists. He is.

1322
01:50:52,856 --> 01:50:54,024
Stop.

1323
01:50:54,900 --> 01:50:58,111
Blow him away.
It's over. We're done.

1324
01:50:58,278 --> 01:50:59,696
You're right.

1325
01:51:08,997 --> 01:51:11,208
No, we made enough noise.

1326
01:51:14,336 --> 01:51:15,879
He's gone anyway.

1327
01:51:25,722 --> 01:51:27,307
See the papers?

1328
01:51:27,474 --> 01:51:28,474
What?

1329
01:51:28,809 --> 01:51:31,770
That cocksucker Dallier is alive.
Imagine?

1330
01:51:31,937 --> 01:51:34,481
So what? That's even better.

1331
01:51:34,648 --> 01:51:36,567
Better? How? It's a catastrophe.

1332
01:51:36,859 --> 01:51:41,113
I said not to send the pictures.
Even sympathetic press is shocked.

1333
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:42,280
Screw them.

1334
01:51:42,656 --> 01:51:44,867
A right-wing piece of shit.

1335
01:51:45,075 --> 01:51:46,285
Not even a reporter.

1336
01:51:46,451 --> 01:51:47,619
A snitch.

1337
01:51:48,537 --> 01:51:50,205
Those considerations

1338
01:51:50,581 --> 01:51:52,499
mean shit to journalists.

1339
01:51:52,666 --> 01:51:54,960
Dallier has press ID.
You hit one of theirs.

1340
01:51:55,127 --> 01:51:56,545
"One of theirs."

1341
01:51:56,753 --> 01:51:58,171
What does that mean?

1342
01:51:58,964 --> 01:51:59,964
Look,

1343
01:52:00,215 --> 01:52:02,050
just read the papers.

1344
01:52:02,384 --> 01:52:03,384
From now on,

1345
01:52:03,510 --> 01:52:05,053
our days are numbered.

1346
01:52:06,555 --> 01:52:07,931
See you later.

1347
01:52:16,690 --> 01:52:17,690
<i>Hello, my love.</i>

1348
01:52:19,067 --> 01:52:22,696
<i>Certainly, if you're listening to this,
my sweet Sylvia,</i>

1349
01:52:22,988 --> 01:52:24,573
<i>then I am no more.</i>

1350
01:52:25,741 --> 01:52:29,077
<i>Just a souvenir of my voice,
of the two of us.</i>

1351
01:52:30,287 --> 01:52:32,623
<i>Yes, my dear.
Your husband is dead.</i>

1352
01:52:32,915 --> 01:52:35,167
<i>Fallen under police fire.</i>

1353
01:52:37,127 --> 01:52:38,754
You know, honey,

1354
01:52:39,671 --> 01:52:42,633
when a man has chosen to live
by the sword, by theft,

1355
01:52:43,133 --> 01:52:44,384
by violence,

1356
01:52:46,011 --> 01:52:48,472
he doesn't often die in his bed.

1357
01:52:50,474 --> 01:52:51,934
<i>After all,</i>

1358
01:52:52,601 --> 01:52:57,022
<i>knowing whether it's me or the police
that fired, that's not the point.</i>

1359
01:52:57,272 --> 01:52:59,149
My death is no more senseless

1360
01:52:59,983 --> 01:53:01,818
than dying in a car crash,

1361
01:53:02,194 --> 01:53:04,196
<i>or working for a factory boss.</i>

1362
01:53:04,529 --> 01:53:05,529
So.

1363
01:53:06,823 --> 01:53:09,868
<i>Death, in the end, doesn't exist.</i>

1364
01:53:10,869 --> 01:53:14,456
<i>Death is nothing
to someone who knew how to live.</i>

1365
01:53:15,082 --> 01:53:16,959
At least I can say

1366
01:53:17,793 --> 01:53:20,128
I didn't waste my life.

1367
01:53:20,587 --> 01:53:25,384
Criminally, you can't succeed in life.
But as for the heart...

1368
01:53:26,426 --> 01:53:29,137
<i>As for the heart, I had you, my love.</i>

1369
01:53:29,304 --> 01:53:30,889
And being a criminal,

1370
01:53:31,723 --> 01:53:33,517
<i>I had made a choice.</i>

1371
01:53:34,726 --> 01:53:36,353
<i>I chose to be...</i>

1372
01:53:36,561 --> 01:53:38,772
<i>comfortable through crime,</i>

1373
01:53:38,939 --> 01:53:43,151
<i>always targeting...
well, almost always, I think...</i>

1374
01:53:43,402 --> 01:53:45,821
<i>the well-to-do, the rich.</i>

1375
01:53:47,823 --> 01:53:48,448
<i>Anyway,</i>

1376
01:53:48,615 --> 01:53:52,494
once I'm dead,
I'm guilty of nothing. I've paid.

1377
01:53:53,537 --> 01:53:55,080
<i>The odd thing is,</i>

1378
01:53:55,247 --> 01:53:58,417
<i>some will see me
as an example, a hero.</i>

1379
01:53:58,583 --> 01:54:00,168
<i>But in reality,</i>

1380
01:54:00,669 --> 01:54:02,421
there are no heroes in crime.

1381
01:54:02,879 --> 01:54:06,133
<i>Only men who've chosen
to live outside the law.</i>

1382
01:54:06,299 --> 01:54:09,386
<i>I died gun in hand.
Even if, who knows,</i>

1383
01:54:09,553 --> 01:54:11,513
<i>I never had time to use it.</i>

1384
01:54:11,680 --> 01:54:14,975
<i>The only thing I know is,
if you're listening to this tape,</i>

1385
01:54:15,142 --> 01:54:19,312
<i>then I'm in a cell
from which there is no escape.</i>

1386
01:54:21,648 --> 01:54:25,402
NOVEMBER 2, 1979

1387
01:54:30,282 --> 01:54:32,409
Robert, your newspaper.

1388
01:54:36,371 --> 01:54:38,373
BARRE'S HOMAGE TO ROBERT BOULIN

1389
01:54:40,208 --> 01:54:43,920
Boulin will be old news tomorrow.
What do you think?

1390
01:54:44,671 --> 01:54:46,465
What do I give a shit?

1391
01:54:56,600 --> 01:54:58,143
Coming out, coming out.

1392
01:55:07,152 --> 01:55:08,570
The redhead is outside.

1393
01:55:09,071 --> 01:55:10,489
Poodle on a leash.

1394
01:55:13,950 --> 01:55:15,202
<i>Walking</i> away.

1395
01:55:15,994 --> 01:55:18,413
<i>Up Rue Belliard, toward Mont-Cenis.</i>

1396
01:55:22,375 --> 01:55:24,669
She'll be there in three seconds.

1397
01:55:27,756 --> 01:55:29,549
<i>Dom here. She stopped.</i>

1398
01:55:30,675 --> 01:55:32,385
<i>What's she doing?</i>

1399
01:55:33,845 --> 01:55:35,680
<i>She's looking all around.</i>

1400
01:55:41,061 --> 01:55:42,354
<i>A man coming out.</i>

1401
01:55:42,562 --> 01:55:44,397
<i>Looking around.</i>

1402
01:55:44,981 --> 01:55:46,566
<i>Fuck, it's the big guy!</i>

1403
01:56:02,874 --> 01:56:04,960
Coming closer. No, up Belliard.

1404
01:56:28,275 --> 01:56:30,068
<i>Crossing Mont-Cenis.</i>

1405
01:56:31,194 --> 01:56:32,612
<i>Fuck, he's a big one.</i>

1406
01:56:38,743 --> 01:56:40,871
Walking away. Toward you, Gégé.

1407
01:56:44,916 --> 01:56:48,128
All right, I got him.
Walking up Rue Belliard.

1408
01:56:54,176 --> 01:56:55,760
I lost him. Where is he?

1409
01:56:57,304 --> 01:56:58,471
Gégé, you got him?

1410
01:56:59,014 --> 01:57:00,390
I don't see him.

1411
01:57:04,352 --> 01:57:05,352
Shit.

1412
01:57:10,650 --> 01:57:11,818
There he is.

1413
01:57:11,985 --> 01:57:15,238
<i>He's walking very slowly.
A half block behind the redhead.</i>

1414
01:57:19,451 --> 01:57:21,494
<i>He keeps looking all around.</i>

1415
01:57:22,037 --> 01:57:23,037
<i>Fuck!</i>

1416
01:57:25,457 --> 01:57:28,585
What if he finds out
the tarp is a decoy?

1417
01:57:28,752 --> 01:57:30,253
What do I do?

1418
01:57:30,420 --> 01:57:32,881
- Relax, <i>he</i> won't...
- Shut up!

1419
01:57:35,342 --> 01:57:37,093
He's looking at the van.

1420
01:57:37,260 --> 01:57:40,096
He's coming.
I'm going off the air.

1421
01:57:42,682 --> 01:57:43,682
Gégé.

1422
01:58:40,782 --> 01:58:42,242
I don't see them.

1423
01:58:42,742 --> 01:58:44,327
What do you mean?

1424
01:58:44,494 --> 01:58:46,663
<i>They were right in front of me.</i>

1425
01:58:46,830 --> 01:58:48,748
<i>Can you spot anything?</i>

1426
01:58:49,165 --> 01:58:50,750
<i>I got nothing. Nothing.</i>

1427
01:58:50,917 --> 01:58:51,917
Calm down.

1428
01:59:01,052 --> 01:59:02,679
I got nothing.
There he is!

1429
01:59:08,852 --> 01:59:09,852
All right.

1430
01:59:12,939 --> 01:59:16,943
Mesrine's here, with the girl.
In a brown metallic BMW.

1431
01:59:24,951 --> 01:59:27,871
83 CSG 75. I repeat...

1432
01:59:33,668 --> 01:59:36,880
He's backing up to the building.
It's yours, Jojo.

1433
01:59:51,436 --> 01:59:54,064
The BMW is backing up.

1434
01:59:54,606 --> 01:59:55,940
Coming toward me.

1435
01:59:56,399 --> 01:59:57,650
He's stopping.

1436
01:59:59,736 --> 02:00:01,946
<i>They're getting out, her first.</i>

1437
02:00:10,997 --> 02:00:12,999
She's going to the building.

1438
02:00:14,501 --> 02:00:15,501
He's getting out.

1439
02:00:18,463 --> 02:00:19,589
Toward me.

1440
02:00:19,756 --> 02:00:20,924
<i>Stay calm.</i>

1441
02:00:21,091 --> 02:00:23,301
He's coming at me. What do I do?

1442
02:00:27,222 --> 02:00:28,473
Jojo come in.

1443
02:00:36,481 --> 02:00:37,481
Jojo!

1444
02:01:01,131 --> 02:01:04,801
He leaned up against my car.
I nearly shit my pants.

1445
02:01:05,844 --> 02:01:08,221
<i>She's putting stuff in the trunk.</i>

1446
02:01:17,439 --> 02:01:19,190
She got back in the car.

1447
02:01:25,447 --> 02:01:27,907
They're driving toward you, Gégé.

1448
02:01:28,283 --> 02:01:29,283
Got it.

1449
02:01:29,534 --> 02:01:30,827
Coming up Rue Belliard.

1450
02:01:32,203 --> 02:01:34,622
<i>Coming up Mont-Cenis. We got him.</i>

1451
02:01:36,875 --> 02:01:39,836
In a few days,
I go to Milan with Charlie.

1452
02:01:40,003 --> 02:01:41,004
Milan?

1453
02:01:41,463 --> 02:01:42,464
Why?

1454
02:01:42,672 --> 02:01:45,967
To meet some friends of his.
Red Brigades.

1455
02:01:46,301 --> 02:01:47,343
Not taking me?

1456
02:01:47,719 --> 02:01:49,012
Can't this time.

1457
02:01:50,430 --> 02:01:53,349
The BMW just passed me,
moderate speed.

1458
02:01:53,725 --> 02:01:55,351
<i>Red light at the corner.</i>

1459
02:01:58,688 --> 02:01:59,688
Don't sulk.

1460
02:02:00,231 --> 02:02:02,692
We have a new apartment.
You can fix it up.

1461
02:02:03,067 --> 02:02:04,611
Without you it's no fun.

1462
02:02:11,409 --> 02:02:14,287
The big guy just stopped,
behind three cars.

1463
02:02:14,454 --> 02:02:18,041
Set it up for Clignancourt.
Don't let him on the ring road.

1464
02:02:25,465 --> 02:02:27,008
I won't be gone long.

1465
02:02:32,555 --> 02:02:34,516
<i>Dom here. Coming to Ornano.</i>

1466
02:02:36,434 --> 02:02:37,434
Love me?

1467
02:02:38,186 --> 02:02:39,521
Yes, I love you.

1468
02:02:51,282 --> 02:02:53,076
<i>The light turned green.</i>

1469
02:02:53,243 --> 02:02:54,035
<i>Heads up.</i>

1470
02:02:54,202 --> 02:02:55,537
The BMW is moving.

1471
02:03:01,167 --> 02:03:03,002
<i>Jojo here, headed for Clignancourt.</i>

1472
02:03:06,256 --> 02:03:08,424
<i>I see Clignancourt. We're good.</i>

1473
02:03:34,117 --> 02:03:35,117
Shit!

1474
02:03:36,869 --> 02:03:40,081
Think of that.
I was born not a mile away.

1475
02:03:44,877 --> 02:03:46,796
BMW coming, I see it.

1476
02:03:49,090 --> 02:03:50,216
<i>BMW is on site.</i>

1477
02:03:50,383 --> 02:03:51,634
Goddammit!

1478
02:04:30,256 --> 02:04:31,841
- Go ahead.
- Let him pass.

1479
02:06:16,237 --> 02:06:18,239
Get out!

1480
02:06:18,406 --> 02:06:21,242
I said out!
You don't hear me?

1481
02:06:21,659 --> 02:06:23,453
I said get out.

1482
02:06:23,619 --> 02:06:24,620
My dog!

1483
02:06:26,414 --> 02:06:28,791
On the ground!

1484
02:06:29,625 --> 02:06:31,586
- You killed my dog!
- Don't move!

1485
02:06:34,422 --> 02:06:37,258
You killed my dog,
you assholes!

1486
02:06:38,426 --> 02:06:39,469
Don't move!

1487
02:06:52,356 --> 02:06:53,733
Don't move!

1488
02:06:54,776 --> 02:06:55,776
The cuffs.

1489
02:07:05,119 --> 02:07:06,119
Let's go.

1490
02:07:18,382 --> 02:07:19,550
The dog.

1491
02:07:20,343 --> 02:07:22,094
Get the dog to a vet.

1492
02:07:22,887 --> 02:07:24,722
Seal this all off.

1493
02:07:26,098 --> 02:07:27,892
