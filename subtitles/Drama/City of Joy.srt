1
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,128
I'm out dad.

2
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:07,628
I'm out, I'm resigning.

3
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:13,587
I always thought you'd be a quitter.

4
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,420
...discipline here.

5
00:03:14,503 --> 00:03:15,837
But you let me down.

6
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,920
Haven't I been an

7
00:03:18,003 --> 00:03:21,628
Well okay, run and see where that gets you.
Even at school you were a quitter.

8
00:03:22,253 --> 00:03:25,295
Okay then run and see where that gets you.

9
00:04:19,587 --> 00:04:20,503
Where are you going?

10
00:04:20,753 --> 00:04:22,587
We are going to Calcutta to become rich.

11
00:04:25,045 --> 00:04:27,503
Our farm has died that's why we are going.

12
00:04:52,212 --> 00:04:53,337
Shambu, don't go too far.

13
00:04:54,087 --> 00:04:55,003
Okay, baba.

14
00:04:58,128 --> 00:05:00,837
Baba, baba, bus is coming,
ba, bus is coming.

15
00:05:02,628 --> 00:05:04,003
The bus has come.

16
00:05:04,503 --> 00:05:05,837
Hey!

17
00:05:06,462 --> 00:05:08,795
Hey, hey stop, stop!

18
00:05:08,878 --> 00:05:09,795
Let's hurry up.

19
00:05:09,878 --> 00:05:11,628
Pick up that.

20
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:13,045
Come, hurry up.

21
00:05:13,128 --> 00:05:13,962
Okay, baba.

22
00:05:14,045 --> 00:05:15,087
Come, baba.

23
00:05:16,295 --> 00:05:17,045
Here.

24
00:05:17,378 --> 00:05:18,545
-...put it carefully, please.
- Baba...

25
00:05:18,628 --> 00:05:20,253
You go, get into the bus.

26
00:05:23,545 --> 00:05:24,170
Bless you.

27
00:05:24,462 --> 00:05:26,378
Bless you, bless you both.

28
00:05:26,462 --> 00:05:27,670
Bless you, Amrita.

29
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,420
- Amrita, Amrita, bahave like a good girl.
- Go on child, go on child.

30
00:05:30,503 --> 00:05:31,503
And help your mother.

31
00:05:31,587 --> 00:05:32,795
- Take care.
- And you too.

32
00:05:32,878 --> 00:05:34,795
Don't fight with each other,
understand?

33
00:05:34,878 --> 00:05:37,045
- And come along, Manooj.
- That's right.

34
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:40,128
And stay away from the
cinema do you hear?

35
00:05:40,212 --> 00:05:40,878
And Kamla, you will look after
these children

36
00:05:40,962 --> 00:05:42,128
Not there, hot there, put it here.

37
00:05:42,212 --> 00:05:43,712
And tie that bundle to the rod, please.

38
00:05:43,795 --> 00:05:45,087
- Son
- Thank you.

39
00:05:45,795 --> 00:05:47,837
Baba don't worry about Amrita.

40
00:05:48,128 --> 00:05:50,045
I will be saving money for her dowry.

41
00:05:50,128 --> 00:05:51,837
I will be writing you soon.

42
00:05:52,212 --> 00:05:53,962
Don't worry about anything,

43
00:05:54,045 --> 00:05:57,295
A man's journey to the end of his
obligations is a very long road.

44
00:05:57,378 --> 00:05:58,587
And Shambu do take care of your brother.

45
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:01,170
- Yes.
- It might not be what you expect.

46
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,170
And be obedient, listen to what your
father says, okay?

47
00:06:03,253 --> 00:06:05,212
Come.

48
00:06:06,087 --> 00:06:07,253
God bless you all!

49
00:06:07,337 --> 00:06:09,628
Ba I'll write to you soon.

50
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:14,295
Shambu, Shambu!

51
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:15,962
Careful!

52
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,670
Shambu Shambu!

53
00:07:21,753 --> 00:07:22,420
Shambu!

54
00:07:22,503 --> 00:07:24,753
Baba, baba!

55
00:07:24,837 --> 00:07:25,253
Come out.

56
00:07:27,545 --> 00:07:29,295
- Amrita, help your mother.
- Shambu!

57
00:07:29,378 --> 00:07:32,462
- Shambu!
- Shambu!

58
00:07:32,545 --> 00:07:34,712
- Baba, baba!
- Shambu!

59
00:07:34,795 --> 00:07:36,962
- Shambu!
- Shambu!

60
00:07:37,045 --> 00:07:38,295
Here boy!
Give me that box!

61
00:07:38,378 --> 00:07:39,212
Give me the food!

62
00:07:39,295 --> 00:07:41,128
Give me the food from the box, give me!

63
00:07:41,212 --> 00:07:42,378
Give me the food!

64
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,462
Shambu!

65
00:07:43,545 --> 00:07:45,170
There he is.
Shambu come here!

66
00:07:48,212 --> 00:07:48,920
Are you all right?

67
00:07:49,212 --> 00:07:50,420
Ma, I saw a leper.

68
00:07:50,712 --> 00:07:51,962
Is that bad luck?

69
00:07:52,045 --> 00:07:53,087
<i>9o_</i>

70
00:07:55,962 --> 00:07:58,003
Where where is the address?

71
00:08:35,128 --> 00:08:35,920
Hey, you!

72
00:08:37,545 --> 00:08:38,253
Listen.

73
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:39,670
Come here!

74
00:08:41,795 --> 00:08:43,295
You are new in this city.

75
00:08:43,837 --> 00:08:45,295
And have nowhere to sleep?

76
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,670
Yes.

77
00:08:46,753 --> 00:08:48,503
There
are places by the riverside.

78
00:08:48,587 --> 00:08:49,253
Thank you, sir.

79
00:08:49,337 --> 00:08:50,628
Over there.

80
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:52,962
He's saying there's a place by the river.

81
00:08:53,587 --> 00:08:54,670
What's the matter with you?

82
00:08:54,753 --> 00:08:55,545
Nothing, baba.

83
00:08:56,837 --> 00:08:57,545
Come.

84
00:08:59,628 --> 00:09:00,378
Come.

85
00:09:01,087 --> 00:09:02,128
Careful.

86
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:06,420
Stay together.

87
00:09:33,378 --> 00:09:34,128
You are worried?

88
00:09:34,212 --> 00:09:35,003
No.

89
00:09:37,962 --> 00:09:38,753
Don't worry.

90
00:09:40,128 --> 00:09:41,920
I am sure I will find work today.

91
00:09:54,045 --> 00:09:55,128
I've been trying all day, sir.

92
00:09:55,212 --> 00:09:58,087
Is it possible to find some
work even for a day?

93
00:09:58,378 --> 00:09:59,795
Try one of those shops there.

94
00:09:59,878 --> 00:10:01,670
Wait there.

95
00:10:04,962 --> 00:10:07,003
Don't go, stay there.

96
00:10:12,628 --> 00:10:13,462
Yes?

97
00:10:13,545 --> 00:10:15,212
Could I get some work?

98
00:10:15,295 --> 00:10:16,878
- Oh no, sorry, go go away.
- Sir

99
00:10:16,962 --> 00:10:19,128
Sir listen to me, sir, I come from Bihar.

100
00:10:19,212 --> 00:10:21,378
Go there's nothing in the morning
Go away, please go away now.

101
00:10:21,462 --> 00:10:24,753
For
two years there's been no rain, sir.

102
00:10:37,628 --> 00:10:39,170
This address I don't know.

103
00:10:41,128 --> 00:10:42,337
Shambu Manooj.

104
00:10:42,878 --> 00:10:43,795
Come here quickly.

105
00:10:43,878 --> 00:10:44,587
Yes, ma.

106
00:10:46,795 --> 00:10:48,295
You'll get a smack now if you
don't stay together.

107
00:10:48,378 --> 00:10:49,253
Come.

108
00:10:54,045 --> 00:10:57,545
Look, look Shambu,
look there's a cinema, look, see?

109
00:10:57,587 --> 00:10:58,503
Come, hurry up.

110
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,003
Tea.

111
00:11:20,545 --> 00:11:21,045
Here.

112
00:11:21,128 --> 00:11:22,420
Hello, boys.

113
00:11:25,962 --> 00:11:27,795
Hey, you are from Bihar.

114
00:11:27,878 --> 00:11:28,878
Yes.

115
00:11:28,962 --> 00:11:30,462
I am also from Bihar.

116
00:11:30,545 --> 00:11:32,128
This your family?

117
00:11:32,212 --> 00:11:33,212
Ah-ha.

118
00:11:33,295 --> 00:11:34,837
You look worried.

119
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:37,295
It's not necessary.

120
00:11:37,378 --> 00:11:38,712
Thank the Gods.

121
00:11:38,795 --> 00:11:41,003
I am Mr Gangooly.

122
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,878
Come in, come in.

123
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,837
Fell at home look around

124
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,962
Madam look around.

125
00:12:03,003 --> 00:12:04,337
They'll need feeding.

126
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,962
Give them seed but don't spoil them.

127
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,587
Now.

128
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:11,920
One of
the miracles of the life in the city

129
00:12:12,003 --> 00:12:13,087
TWO

130
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,670
three.

131
00:12:14,753 --> 00:12:18,170
Holy water from
the ganges flows out forever.

132
00:12:18,253 --> 00:12:21,295
That's it, that's it.

133
00:12:28,253 --> 00:12:30,587
Now the place is yours for a month.

134
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,503
My cousin Moti is away.

135
00:12:32,587 --> 00:12:34,587
See there, inside.

136
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,753
You'll like it.

137
00:12:35,837 --> 00:12:39,087
Normally the rent takes four hundred rupees
for a month.

138
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,087
Come, come.

139
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,337
Come, have seat.

140
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:45,587
But for a brother it is three hundred.

141
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,420
No, don't thank me.

142
00:12:47,503 --> 00:12:48,962
No, see

143
00:12:49,337 --> 00:12:50,962
I have only

144
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:52,670
two hundred.

145
00:12:52,753 --> 00:12:56,337
Look, look Shambu,
pay the rest next week.

146
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,337
You will find work, I trust you

147
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,087
Aren't I from Bihar, too?

148
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,753
Yes.

149
00:13:02,837 --> 00:13:04,420
You are pleased?

150
00:13:04,503 --> 00:13:07,128
Then Mr Gangooly is pleased.

151
00:13:07,212 --> 00:13:10,170
It's how I am.

152
00:13:11,128 --> 00:13:12,212
Thank you.

153
00:13:22,503 --> 00:13:24,587
Uncle please, uncle.

154
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,420
Huh?

155
00:13:25,503 --> 00:13:27,837
Please, give me food.

156
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,503
Uncle, please give me money.

157
00:13:29,587 --> 00:13:30,753
Oh, okay.

158
00:13:30,837 --> 00:13:32,128
Here's a coin.

159
00:13:32,503 --> 00:13:34,420
Watch it, watch it.

160
00:13:34,503 --> 00:13:36,003
Where is it?

161
00:13:36,087 --> 00:13:37,462
I got it.

162
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,170
You can have it.

163
00:13:39,253 --> 00:13:42,212
Oh Shit.

164
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:46,295
See you later okay.

165
00:13:46,587 --> 00:13:48,753
Yes, sir.

166
00:13:48,837 --> 00:13:53,712
Hey okay.

167
00:14:01,337 --> 00:14:02,170
What's your name?

168
00:14:02,253 --> 00:14:03,087
Ishmael.

169
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,253
Ishmael

170
00:14:04,337 --> 00:14:06,753
Ishmael with the smile, huh?

171
00:14:06,837 --> 00:14:08,837
Hello, hello.

172
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,920
Welcome, sir how many nights?

173
00:14:12,003 --> 00:14:13,503
Uno noce.

174
00:14:13,587 --> 00:14:15,003
One night.

175
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:16,670
May I see your passport, please?

176
00:14:16,753 --> 00:14:18,712
You certainly may.

177
00:14:21,337 --> 00:14:23,378
Oh goddam.

178
00:14:24,087 --> 00:14:25,920
I must have left
it at the Ashram.

179
00:14:26,003 --> 00:14:26,420
C)h

180
00:14:26,503 --> 00:14:28,087
I'm sure it can be sorted out.

181
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,795
Shit.

182
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,878
Come, sahib.

183
00:14:35,253 --> 00:14:36,462
Come.

184
00:14:42,837 --> 00:14:43,878
It pleases you, sir?

185
00:14:45,753 --> 00:14:47,837
No furit basket, no mini bar.

186
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,378
Bar?

187
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,462
Of course so many.

188
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:55,587
Please for me...

189
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:58,378
If you like drink come to me below.

190
00:14:58,753 --> 00:15:01,253
If it is a lady you like to know tell me.

191
00:15:01,337 --> 00:15:02,170
Very sweet girl.

192
00:15:02,253 --> 00:15:04,462
Er, no, no, I don't need a lady.

193
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,003
What I need is a bath.

194
00:15:06,087 --> 00:15:07,920
Boy very, very good boy.

195
00:15:08,003 --> 00:15:09,587
No, bath, bath.

196
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,587
There you go.

197
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,462
Thank you, er-- Ishmael.

198
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,795
Meditate on this.

199
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:08,128
Where you come from huh?

200
00:16:08,212 --> 00:16:10,128
Get out!
Take! Get them out.

201
00:16:10,212 --> 00:16:13,545
- What are you doing here?
- Get them out!

202
00:16:13,628 --> 00:16:15,045
What are you doing here?

203
00:16:15,128 --> 00:16:16,628
Mr Gangooly rented us this place.

204
00:16:16,712 --> 00:16:17,462
You are lying!

205
00:16:17,545 --> 00:16:18,378
You, you must be his cousin Moti.

206
00:16:18,462 --> 00:16:20,378
- I don't know any Moti or any Gangooly.
- Please calm.

207
00:16:20,628 --> 00:16:21,795
My name is Binal and this is my home.

208
00:16:21,878 --> 00:16:25,045
I gave him all my money, sir.

209
00:16:25,128 --> 00:16:26,545
You have
given your money to a crook.

210
00:16:26,628 --> 00:16:29,712
- What can I do?
- No, no, he had the key.

211
00:16:30,337 --> 00:16:31,587
...some beggars get in.

212
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,170
He had the keys!

213
00:16:34,253 --> 00:16:37,170
I don't want to hear anything, get out!

214
00:16:37,253 --> 00:16:38,920
...we are going.

215
00:16:39,003 --> 00:16:40,837
Baba!

216
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,253
GO, go!

217
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:45,795
Get out, beggars!

218
00:16:47,087 --> 00:16:51,628
There's plenty of room in the street
for you. Go on, back in the streets.

219
00:16:51,712 --> 00:16:55,462
Beggars, beggars out. Go on, get out.

220
00:16:55,545 --> 00:16:57,045
Don't push!

221
00:16:57,128 --> 00:17:00,587
Get out. Go and live on the river.

222
00:17:02,878 --> 00:17:03,920
Shambu come here.

223
00:17:08,753 --> 00:17:10,712
Move!

224
00:17:46,962 --> 00:17:47,920
Hold on.

225
00:17:48,712 --> 00:17:50,003
Yeah?

226
00:17:50,295 --> 00:17:51,545
Ishmael.

227
00:17:51,587 --> 00:17:53,503
What?

228
00:17:54,878 --> 00:17:56,753
Very sweet girl.

229
00:17:57,128 --> 00:17:58,878
Mr Max is American.

230
00:17:58,962 --> 00:18:01,670
Very disciplined.

231
00:18:02,712 --> 00:18:04,337
Ishmael...

232
00:18:09,462 --> 00:18:10,503
What's your name?

233
00:18:11,128 --> 00:18:12,420
Poomina.

234
00:18:16,045 --> 00:18:17,962
How old are you, Poonina?

235
00:18:18,045 --> 00:18:19,837
Twenty, sir.

236
00:18:21,878 --> 00:18:23,420
I'll buy that.

237
00:18:45,503 --> 00:18:47,087
No. I,

238
00:18:47,462 --> 00:18:49,128
ls problem, sir?

239
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:50,253
Yes there's a problem.

240
00:19:40,295 --> 00:19:43,253
I remember the first day I saw you on
the day of our marriage.

241
00:19:43,837 --> 00:19:45,503
Wearing a bright yellow turban.

242
00:19:46,962 --> 00:19:48,503
You asked me my name and said...

243
00:19:49,378 --> 00:19:50,837
you're a very beautiful girl

244
00:19:51,295 --> 00:19:53,337
and I'm wondering whether you'll
find me appealing.

245
00:19:59,295 --> 00:20:00,837
Maybe the God is taking a test.

246
00:20:01,962 --> 00:20:05,837
I feel I'm such a burden.

247
00:20:07,253 --> 00:20:08,920
In the village I could be of use.

248
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:13,670
Maybe the children and I should go
out to the cars?

249
00:20:15,795 --> 00:20:16,837
You mean beg?

250
00:20:20,962 --> 00:20:22,170
We didn't come here to bag.

251
00:21:03,253 --> 00:21:04,295

252
00:21:04,378 --> 00:21:05,045

Is problem, sahib?

255
00:21:07,295 --> 00:21:08,628
Is problem, no problem.

256
00:21:08,712 --> 00:21:10,295
Okay, er see, sahib.

257
00:21:10,378 --> 00:21:11,753
Special drink for you.

258
00:21:12,087 --> 00:21:14,128
Only the most man can drink it.

259
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:15,962
For me you make try, huh?

260
00:21:16,003 --> 00:21:16,795

262
00:21:19,837 --> 00:21:20,670

263
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:21,920
Who drink first? We bet.

264
00:21:22,003 --> 00:21:23,587
- How much?
- Ten rupees.

265
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:25,670
- We bet okay?
- Okay.

266
00:21:25,753 --> 00:21:26,795
Go.

267
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,253
Ha-ha.

268
00:21:28,337 --> 00:21:29,503
- I win.
- I win.

269
00:21:29,545 --> 00:21:31,920
No, no, no, I never
lose a truly irrelevant contest.

270
00:21:32,003 --> 00:21:34,253
Second drink.

271
00:21:34,337 --> 00:21:36,378
See more drink, huh.

272
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,253

00:21:38,337 --> 00:21:38,920

274
00:21:39,003 --> 00:21:40,378
Again we bet.

275
00:21:41,087 --> 00:21:42,337
- Ten rupees.
- Oh yeah.

276
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,378
This time no cheat, hands here.

277
00:21:45,837 --> 00:21:47,087
Set go!

278
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,628
I beat.

279
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:52,878
No you don't

280
00:21:52,962 --> 00:21:54,420
No.

281
00:21:55,837 --> 00:21:57,962
Show me a sign

282
00:21:58,045 --> 00:22:01,545
Take it to the limit one more time.

283
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:02,128
What.

284
00:22:02,212 --> 00:22:03,545
Poomina!

285
00:22:03,628 --> 00:22:04,670

00:22:05,712 --> 00:22:06,753
Where you going?

287
00:22:22,545 --> 00:22:23,337
Nice bike.

288
00:22:28,378 --> 00:22:29,420
Oh goddam.

289
00:22:33,462 --> 00:22:34,753
Seek and ye shall find.

290
00:22:35,295 --> 00:22:36,837
You bastard!

291
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,712
What's that?

292
00:22:44,795 --> 00:22:45,295
Nothing.

293
00:22:45,378 --> 00:22:51,462
- You son of a bitch!
- Someone needs help.

294
00:22:51,545 --> 00:22:52,962
You shouldn't go over there.

295
00:22:53,045 --> 00:22:54,837
Brother just look after my family.

296
00:22:55,212 --> 00:22:56,378
You, don't go over there.

297
00:22:56,462 --> 00:22:58,128
Listen, come back.
I say, you will be in trouble.

298
00:22:58,212 --> 00:23:00,003
Who is there?

299
00:23:00,795 --> 00:23:02,295
Hey what are you doing.

300
00:23:02,378 --> 00:23:03,837

Sahib.

308
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:30,253
Sahib.

309
00:23:30,337 --> 00:23:31,795
Sahib.

310
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:34,087
- Who are you, who are you?
- Sshhh!

311
00:23:35,378 --> 00:23:36,212
Sahib.

312
00:23:36,295 --> 00:23:37,128
Oh God!

00:23:37,212 --> 00:23:38,295
Hey help me.

314
00:23:38,378 --> 00:23:39,837
I know where we can take him.

315
00:23:55,128 --> 00:23:55,920
There now junior.

316
00:23:57,628 --> 00:23:58,170
Welcome to India.

317
00:24:00,212 --> 00:24:01,128

318
00:24:01,212 --> 00:24:03,295
All right?

319
00:24:03,378 --> 00:24:04,378
Where am I?

320
00:24:04,462 --> 00:24:06,587
You're in the city of Joy.

321
00:24:07,128 --> 00:24:10,003
The City of...

322
00:24:10,795 --> 00:24:12,962
Is that geographical or spiritual?

323
00:24:13,045 --> 00:24:15,087
I think that depends on your point of view.

324
00:24:15,462 --> 00:24:17,670
Oh, this is the gentleman
who brought you in.

325
00:24:17,753 --> 00:24:19,003
He and a young lady.

326
00:24:19,087 --> 00:24:21,545
Did, er I do that to your nose?

327
00:24:23,087 --> 00:24:24,628
I'm sorry.

328
00:24:28,087 --> 00:24:30,795
Er, whoever it was they'll have
cleaned you out I'm afraid.

329
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,462
Auntie Joan.

330
00:24:33,837 --> 00:24:34,962
What brings you to India?

331
00:24:35,503 --> 00:24:36,212
Thanks.

332
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:39,753
I came to find enlightenment.

333
00:24:39,837 --> 00:24:41,545
Oh and have you found it?

334
00:24:42,003 --> 00:24:46,378
I've been opening the windows and doors of
my soul and I haven't seen a damn thing yet

335
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:50,045
There now.

336
00:24:51,587 --> 00:24:53,045
Er...

337
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,212
it's it's okay, I can do it.

338
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:57,587
Mind your head.

339
00:24:59,378 --> 00:25:00,253
Got it.

340
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:15,837
Jesus H Christ.

341
00:25:26,128 --> 00:25:26,962
Are you a doctor?

342
00:25:27,045 --> 00:25:29,128
No corporate executive.

343
00:25:29,212 --> 00:25:29,545
No...

344
00:25:29,628 --> 00:25:32,837
we have a young intern who comes in
three days a week at seven-thirty.

345
00:25:34,795 --> 00:25:35,795
Must be one of the three days.

346
00:25:35,878 --> 00:25:36,920
Yes.

347
00:25:37,212 --> 00:25:39,878
How is he?

348
00:25:39,962 --> 00:25:40,795
He is fantastic.

349
00:25:40,878 --> 00:25:42,503
Come and see me later, right?

350
00:25:43,378 --> 00:25:44,962
That is a dispensary?

351
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:46,462
Humble though it is.

352
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:48,253
Hello, Auntie Joan Di.

353
00:25:51,378 --> 00:25:53,087
What is it that you
do in America?

354
00:25:55,378 --> 00:25:59,087
Oh God, you're very titillating, aren't
you? Are you a criminal of some sort?

355
00:25:59,795 --> 00:26:02,212
Well that depends on how you
define the word.

356
00:26:02,295 --> 00:26:03,420
I was a doctor.

357
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:05,212
Go away.

358
00:26:05,295 --> 00:26:06,212
How long are you here for?

359
00:26:06,295 --> 00:26:07,795
Don't try to recruit me.

360
00:26:07,878 --> 00:26:09,628
You've got your non-practising
Catholics...

361
00:26:09,712 --> 00:26:11,545
I'm a non-practising doctor.

362
00:26:11,628 --> 00:26:13,795
So of you could direct me to the hotel.

363
00:26:13,878 --> 00:26:15,462
Why don't you practice?

364
00:26:15,545 --> 00:26:17,878
Because I don't like sick people.

365
00:26:17,962 --> 00:26:21,337
Thank you.

366
00:26:23,295 --> 00:26:24,878
I owe you one

367
00:26:24,962 --> 00:26:25,920
Yeah.

368
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:29,253
Listen, can I at least...

369
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,670
- No, no, no...
-please.

370
00:26:30,753 --> 00:26:33,378
Oh, when they clean you out here

371
00:26:33,753 --> 00:26:35,837
- Ram Bhai.
- Yes, memsahib?

372
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,962
- Here's your first ride of the day.
- Thank you, memsahib.

373
00:26:38,253 --> 00:26:39,462
Here...

374
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,087
No, I...

375
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,253
Ah, go on.

376
00:26:42,337 --> 00:26:43,170
It' s all right.

377
00:26:43,253 --> 00:26:44,545
Excuse me, memsahib.

378
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,878
Now you owe me two

379
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:49,462
Thanks.

380
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,462
Goodbye, memsahib.

381
00:26:55,087 --> 00:26:57,253
So, er you live here?

382
00:26:57,337 --> 00:26:59,462
No, sir, I am from Bihar.

383
00:26:59,837 --> 00:27:02,212
I lost my farm to the money lenders.

384
00:27:04,253 --> 00:27:05,087
Well.

385
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:06,962
You picked one hell of a city.

386
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,212
Excuse me, sir

387
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,837
do you think I can pull one of these?

388
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:16,003
You think any idiot can pull a rickshaw?

389
00:27:16,087 --> 00:27:18,170
No, look sir, look sir.

390
00:27:18,253 --> 00:27:20,087
Look sir, I can run very fast.

391
00:27:20,337 --> 00:27:22,253
- Oh no.
- Hey, hey, give him a shot.

392
00:27:22,337 --> 00:27:22,670
No.

393
00:27:22,753 --> 00:27:24,337
He's as fast as you are and you should
take care of that ankle.

394
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:24,962
- That's all right.
- Thank you.

395
00:27:25,045 --> 00:27:26,545
- Please try me, sir.
- Yeah, let him try,

396
00:27:26,628 --> 00:27:28,878
- You go up.
- Let him try and I'll give you full fare.

397
00:27:28,962 --> 00:27:30,795
- Yeah thank you.
- Make it make us look good, farmer.

398
00:27:30,878 --> 00:27:32,628
Hey, be careful.
You are responsible for this.

399
00:27:32,712 --> 00:27:34,295
- Yes, sir.
- I am telling you.

400
00:27:34,378 --> 00:27:37,503
- Yes, sir.
- Don't worry, sir.

401
00:27:38,545 --> 00:27:39,878
Watch out watch out!

402
00:27:39,962 --> 00:27:42,712
Watch it, watch it, watch it.

403
00:27:42,795 --> 00:27:44,587
My God, this way, come on.

404
00:27:45,712 --> 00:27:46,628
Be careful, there's a car.

405
00:27:46,712 --> 00:27:50,253
Watch what you are doing.

406
00:28:24,337 --> 00:28:26,712
It's the rickshaw wallah with wings,
ladies and gentlemen.

407
00:28:29,587 --> 00:28:31,045
And he does it, what a race.

408
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,045
What a driver!

409
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,795
That was great.

410
00:28:35,087 --> 00:28:36,087
Whoa

411
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:37,920

412
00:28:38,003 --> 00:28:39,503
Did your job.

Thank you.

I'll see you.

416
00:28:47,837 --> 00:28:48,795
Thank you, sahib.

417
00:28:49,587 --> 00:28:51,253
Mr Max did you have a good night?

418
00:28:51,337 --> 00:28:52,503

427
00:29:03,753 --> 00:29:05,003
I need some work.

428
00:29:05,087 --> 00:29:06,962
See, I have a family.

429
00:29:09,003 --> 00:29:09,878

What tell them?

435
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:04,837
It's the son.

436
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,212
He likes your gift.

437
00:30:16,003 --> 00:30:18,795
So, he wants to be a human horse, huh?

438
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:20,045
Yes, babu.

439
00:30:20,753 --> 00:30:22,587
Does he not have a mouth?

440
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:26,628
What babu?

441
00:30:29,003 --> 00:30:30,128
Can you neigh?

442
00:30:33,837 --> 00:30:36,212
Neigh like a horse?

443
00:30:44,503 --> 00:30:45,337
Hey, child

445
00:30:49,462 --> 00:30:50,503
He wants to pull a rickshaw.

446
00:31:00,462 --> 00:31:01,337
Pull up your vest.

447
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:04,837
Take a deep breath.

448
00:31:08,628 --> 00:31:09,420
Leave it.

449
00:31:09,962 --> 00:31:10,962
You have a family?

450
00:31:11,045 --> 00:31:12,045

451
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,628
Wife, three children.

452
00:31:13,712 --> 00:31:15,378
And they have to be fed.

453
00:31:15,462 --> 00:31:17,087
Hmm?

454
00:31:17,962 --> 00:31:20,253
The world is full of open mouths.

455
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:22,420
Child

456
00:31:24,295 --> 00:31:25,003
Put is away.

457
00:31:27,712 --> 00:31:28,587
This is good.

458
00:31:45,545 --> 00:31:46,587
Stay loyal.

459
00:31:46,795 --> 00:31:48,295
Babu

460
00:31:48,378 --> 00:31:50,253
I will always be grateful.

461
00:31:50,712 --> 00:31:53,503
It's a crop no-one plants these days.

462
00:31:58,128 --> 00:31:59,087
Have you a name?

463

Where are you taking us?

466
00:32:16,587 --> 00:32:18,837
It's a long way off--across the city.

467
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:22,795
It's your new home,
it's called the City of Joy.

468
00:32:28,503 --> 00:32:29,295
Where is Shambu?

469
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:30,587

Didn't I say I will find a job huh?

514
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,795
Not there go to your left.

515
00:35:23,878 --> 00:35:25,295
Yeah go to the left.

516
00:35:25,378 --> 00:35:27,212
Yeah there, there.

517
00:35:27,295 --> 00:35:29,045
Yeah, yeah.

518
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:31,087
Okay, just stop it here, just stop it.

519
00:35:33,378 --> 00:35:33,962
I'm sorry.

520
00:35:34,045 --> 00:35:35,212
You are my very first rider.

521
00:35:35,295 --> 00:35:37,378
Oh really well I hope I bring you luck.

522
00:35:37,462 --> 00:35:39,212
Come at four we can go to my place

523
00:35:39,295 --> 00:35:42,253
and meet my parents because they need a
permanent rickshaw wallah.

524
00:35:54,212 --> 00:35:56,628
So you've been here
a longtime, then?

525
00:35:56,712 --> 00:35:58,087
Three of four years.

526
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,712
Oh yeah oh yeah.

527
00:36:00,878 --> 00:36:03,212
- Try some, very tasty.
- I, I really can't eat this.

528
00:36:03,295 --> 00:36:05,087
Er, do you have a hamburger?

529
00:36:05,378 --> 00:36:07,128
Hamburger

530
00:36:07,212 --> 00:36:09,295
Chopped beef chop the beef

531
00:36:09,337 --> 00:36:13,128
You chop it then you push it into a patty.

532
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:13,962
You know.

533
00:36:14,003 --> 00:36:16,128
Then throw it on the grill you know.

534
00:36:16,212 --> 00:36:17,962
Minute and a half like, flip it.

535
00:36:18,045 --> 00:36:19,962
Grilled onions, cheese on a hamburger.

536
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:21,545
Hamburger, you gotta know.

537
00:36:21,628 --> 00:36:25,920
You mean burger.

538
00:36:31,753 --> 00:36:33,087
Hey!

539
00:36:33,337 --> 00:36:34,337
Hey you!

540
00:36:35,212 --> 00:36:36,003
Hey, I want my medallion.

541
00:37:01,212 --> 00:37:02,295
_Hey
_Ql<aV

542
00:37:02,378 --> 00:37:04,045
- Hold on hold on!
- Stop him!

543
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,795
Get out of the way,
you've got to stop that guy!

544
00:37:05,878 --> 00:37:07,128
May I see your passport, please?

545
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:09,045
- Passport, he's got my wallet!
- Passport please!

546
00:37:09,128 --> 00:37:10,795
- May I see your passport?
- He stole my wallet!

547
00:37:10,837 --> 00:37:13,545
- Don't show me your temperament, okay'?
- Hey, hey, hey, don't do that!

548
00:37:13,628 --> 00:37:14,462
He's my friend.

549
00:37:14,545 --> 00:37:15,462
Madam, do you know this fellow?

550
00:37:15,503 --> 00:37:16,212
Yes, I do.

551
00:37:16,295 --> 00:37:17,295
But he doesn't have any passport.

552
00:37:17,378 --> 00:37:19,128
Yes well, he, he, he's with me, he's fine

553
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:19,878
Oh Shit!

554
00:37:19,962 --> 00:37:21,045
If he is with you then it's all right.

555
00:37:21,128 --> 00:37:22,045
Okay?

556
00:37:22,128 --> 00:37:23,503
Now you owe me three

557
00:37:25,295 --> 00:37:27,587
Don't you think we should have a look
at that wrist?

558
00:37:28,003 --> 00:37:29,087
I guess.

559
00:37:29,378 --> 00:37:30,545
Come on then.

560
00:37:30,587 --> 00:37:31,670
Come on boys.

561
00:37:38,878 --> 00:37:39,837
No wait

562
00:37:40,628 --> 00:37:41,212
Okay.

563
00:37:41,295 --> 00:37:43,628
I still think you should let Doctor Sunil
have a look at this.

564
00:37:43,712 --> 00:37:45,420
Doctor Max fixed it.

565
00:37:45,795 --> 00:37:48,337
Well if you want it to heal you really
ought to stop abusing yourself.

566
00:37:49,337 --> 00:37:50,503
Well listen to you.

567
00:37:51,795 --> 00:37:55,545
Are you just nuts or are you doing penance
for some major past sin here?

568
00:37:55,587 --> 00:37:57,795
It's not penance, I love it here.

569
00:37:57,878 --> 00:37:58,962
You love it here?

570
00:37:59,045 --> 00:38:02,378
Came on a whim in the
first place but then I stayed.

571
00:38:02,462 --> 00:38:04,545
In the beginning it was really frustrating

572
00:38:04,628 --> 00:38:06,795
trying to convince them not to be so.

573
00:38:06,878 --> 00:38:09,295
So bloody passive and then.

574
00:38:09,378 --> 00:38:12,462
I realised that I was fighting a thousand
years of acceptance.

575
00:38:12,545 --> 00:38:15,337
Well maybe you should stop
interfering.

576
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,503
Maybe I should.

577
00:38:19,378 --> 00:38:20,253
Joan Di.

578
00:38:21,795 --> 00:38:24,545
Kamla, you've got to
stop doing this.

579
00:38:24,628 --> 00:38:26,337
Happy people are fat, Joan Di.

580
00:38:27,878 --> 00:38:28,670
Thanks.

581
00:38:33,087 --> 00:38:34,962
So where do you get
the bucks for this set-up?

582
00:38:35,045 --> 00:38:39,420
I get a bit from the Swiss
organisation and my ex-husband sends

583
00:38:39,503 --> 00:38:40,378
Jack.

584
00:38:40,837 --> 00:38:41,712
He's great.

585
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:43,378
Uh-huh!

586
00:38:43,837 --> 00:38:45,878
I'm not very good at loving just
one person.

587
00:38:47,253 --> 00:38:49,545
Seems to work out better if I spread
it around a bit.

588
00:38:50,003 --> 00:38:50,962
Can I ask you something?

589
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:54,170
Don't you feel it's just a little
bit stupid

590
00:38:54,253 --> 00:38:57,462
trying to drill a hole
in water like this?

591
00:38:57,753 --> 00:39:00,795
Not nearly as stupid as asking for
a hand and being turned down.

592
00:39:06,253 --> 00:39:07,212
Well

593
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,170
Max.

594
00:39:08,253 --> 00:39:10,087
May I be so bold as to ask
what you believe in?

595
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:11,003
Do you believe in anything?

596
00:39:11,087 --> 00:39:12,420
Absolutely, lady.

597
00:39:12,503 --> 00:39:16,462
I believe in the Dallas Cowboys, the
most oohsisteht winners of the modern era

598
00:39:19,462 --> 00:39:20,670
Excuse me, Mr Max.

599
00:39:20,753 --> 00:39:22,212
Do you saw 'flims'?

600
00:39:22,837 --> 00:39:23,837
Do I saw 'flims'?

601
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,670
He's asking that do you seem 'flim'
when you were small?

602
00:39:27,753 --> 00:39:30,587
If I saw 'flims' when I You mean movies,
pictures?

603
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,753
I saw 'flims' all the time.

604
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:36,253
I saw three a week two on Saturday

605
00:39:36,337 --> 00:39:39,795
cartoons Donald Duck.

606
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:42,878
You're great with kids, anyway.

607
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,253
Do you know what I've come
to think in my old age, Max?

608
00:39:50,337 --> 00:39:52,253
No idea, you're pretty much
an enigma to me.

609
00:39:52,295 --> 00:39:55,712
I think, in life, a person
really only has three choices.

610
00:39:56,087 --> 00:39:58,920
And I don't suppose there's any
way you're not gonna tell me is there?

611
00:39:59,003 --> 00:40:00,503
To run

612
00:40:00,587 --> 00:40:01,587
to spectate

613
00:40:01,628 --> 00:40:03,045
or to commit.

614
00:40:04,003 --> 00:40:05,753
That's very tidy.

615
00:40:05,795 --> 00:40:07,212
Simple minded but tidy.

616
00:40:08,378 --> 00:40:11,295
You're awfully, badly twisted around,

617
00:40:12,253 --> 00:40:14,503
Well one of us sure the hell is.

618
00:40:14,587 --> 00:40:15,670
I'm off, Sister Joan.

619
00:40:15,712 --> 00:40:17,503
Ah, goodnight, god bless Doctor Sunil.

620
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:20,420
Yeah.

621
00:40:24,045 --> 00:40:25,670
Comes from a wealthy medical family.

622
00:40:25,753 --> 00:40:27,045
Donates his time.

623
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,170
Very generous spirited young man.

624
00:40:29,212 --> 00:40:31,628
And clearly not twisted around.

625
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,878
Hey!

626
00:40:46,837 --> 00:40:47,837
No, no, I have to go home.

627
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,128
Hello, miss.

628
00:40:50,587 --> 00:40:51,545
Come.

629
00:40:55,003 --> 00:40:56,378
Okay, bye, see you tomorrow.

630
00:41:10,378 --> 00:41:12,295
Manooj baba is come.

631
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,878
Hey, hey everybody listen.

632
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:20,170
Good news really good news.

633
00:41:20,253 --> 00:41:21,087
And what is that?

634
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:23,753
Hasari has got a regular customer.

635
00:41:23,837 --> 00:41:24,753
And who is that person?

636
00:41:24,837 --> 00:41:26,212
That schoolgirl.

637
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:28,420
On a monthly basis, you say?

638
00:41:28,503 --> 00:41:29,295
Oh yes.

639
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:33,753
You must pay for the tea today.

640
00:41:33,795 --> 00:41:35,045
Yes, yes.

641
00:41:35,337 --> 00:41:36,837
Kamla, wine.

642
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:40,295
The Gods have smiled Hasari has got a
regular customer.

643
00:41:42,503 --> 00:41:43,253
A great day.

644
00:41:48,587 --> 00:41:51,045
It's been a lucky day.

645
00:41:53,587 --> 00:41:54,545
Here

646
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,128
this is for Amrita.

647
00:41:57,003 --> 00:41:58,503
For her dowry.

648
00:41:58,587 --> 00:42:00,795
Let's start a little shelf for her.

649
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,795
Bring me a glass of water.

650
00:42:02,878 --> 00:42:03,712
Yes, baba.

651
00:42:10,087 --> 00:42:11,253
Here.

652
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:12,170
What's that, baba?

653
00:42:12,253 --> 00:42:13,003
Seeds.

654
00:42:13,087 --> 00:42:14,503
What for?

655
00:42:14,587 --> 00:42:16,003
So that we can watch something grow.

656
00:42:16,045 --> 00:42:18,295
Coming, son.

657
00:42:19,337 --> 00:42:20,378
God bless you.

658
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:24,503
Ask him, ask him, ask him.

659
00:42:24,587 --> 00:42:25,337
Baba.

660
00:42:25,378 --> 00:42:27,003
There is a doctor from America.

661
00:42:27,087 --> 00:42:28,503
He sees two 'flims'

662
00:42:28,545 --> 00:42:30,753
and also Mickey Mouse on Saturday.

663
00:42:30,837 --> 00:42:31,670
Can he eat with us?

664
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:42,670
Go go ask him.

665
00:42:42,753 --> 00:42:43,795
Come, come.

666
00:42:46,087 --> 00:42:47,170
Doctor Max, Doctor Max.

667
00:42:47,253 --> 00:42:49,878
Will you eat with us today?

668
00:42:50,878 --> 00:42:51,878
Sure.

669
00:42:56,003 --> 00:42:58,628
See this is the earth from our village.

670
00:42:59,587 --> 00:43:01,545
And water from our new home.

671
00:43:02,878 --> 00:43:04,795
When these seeds grow into flowers.

672
00:43:05,462 --> 00:43:07,378
We'll pluck them and put them in your hair.

673
00:43:07,837 --> 00:43:08,712
On your wedding day.

674
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:12,378
Shambu

675
00:43:12,753 --> 00:43:13,712
go and get some tea.

676
00:43:14,087 --> 00:43:14,962
Yes, baba.

677
00:43:16,753 --> 00:43:18,337
And then everybody will look at you.

678
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:21,212
And say oh, how beautiful she is.

679
00:43:22,337 --> 00:43:25,003
And I'll shed tears of joy.

680
00:43:25,087 --> 00:43:28,253
I was so frightened

681
00:43:28,337 --> 00:43:30,837
my brother gave me something to drink.

682
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,712
I went out to piss under
a tree and fell asleep.

683
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,920
And when I woke up.

684
00:43:37,003 --> 00:43:39,212
I thought I married the tree.

685
00:43:40,878 --> 00:43:43,295
I still love that tree.

686
00:43:44,753 --> 00:43:47,295
If I could pay off the money lender

687
00:43:48,212 --> 00:43:50,295
I'd go straight back to my village.

688
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:52,878
So what's a dowry, Ram?

689
00:43:53,753 --> 00:43:55,753
A heavy burden.

690
00:43:55,837 --> 00:43:56,837
Why do you bother?

691
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,378
Well, it's our duty.

692
00:43:58,920 --> 00:43:59,837
An honour.

693
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:00,670
Thank you, Surya.

694
00:44:00,712 --> 00:44:02,878
Without this our daughters can't marry.

695
00:44:07,587 --> 00:44:08,628
Ma!

696
00:44:14,503 --> 00:44:16,087
Joan Di, Joan Di.

697
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:17,003
Anouar?

698
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:18,670
We need a doctor.

699
00:44:18,753 --> 00:44:20,795
Anouar what's what's wrong?

700
00:44:21,170 --> 00:44:22,337
It's my wife!

701
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:24,753
- It's Meeta.
- Please help my sister.

702
00:44:24,837 --> 00:44:26,795
All right, all right, Poomina.

703
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:28,253
Anouar what's wrong?

704
00:44:28,295 --> 00:44:30,253
It is her time
but something is wrong.

705
00:44:30,337 --> 00:44:31,753
We need Doctor Sunil.

706
00:44:31,837 --> 00:44:33,170
Ram.
run for Doctor Sunil.

707
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:35,420
Oh no, he's not there
it's his cousin's wedding.

708
00:44:35,503 --> 00:44:37,087
Oh God, how,
how long has she been in labour?

709
00:44:37,128 --> 00:44:38,337
Long, long time.

710
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,920
Poomina when did the bleeding start?

711
00:44:40,003 --> 00:44:40,920
Twenty minutes I think.

712
00:44:41,003 --> 00:44:43,128
The midwives, they don't know what to do.

713
00:44:44,962 --> 00:44:46,045
What shall we do?

714
00:44:47,045 --> 00:44:47,962
I don't know what to do!

715
00:44:49,503 --> 00:44:50,587
Max!

716
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:52,253
I will come with you.

717
00:44:52,295 --> 00:44:53,628
I have treat your him.

718
00:44:56,462 --> 00:44:58,253
- Have me diazepan?
- No.

719
00:44:58,337 --> 00:45:00,087
- Sparine.
- No.

720
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:03,462
- You have anything and morphine to cut.
- Notthing.

721
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:05,462
All right.

722
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:07,753
I'll need a sterho scope

723
00:45:07,837 --> 00:45:09,753
a suturing kit, a thermometer

724
00:45:09,837 --> 00:45:11,670
hot swabs, compresses.

725
00:45:11,753 --> 00:45:14,045
Do you have a, a local anaesthetic?

726
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:20,087
No sparine, no morphine, no local
anaesthetic, no organisation.

727
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:22,503
You've got some nerve calling that
place a clinic, you know that?

728
00:45:22,587 --> 00:45:25,545
Yeah, we haven't got a brain scanner
either, Max, but we're doing the best we can.

729
00:45:38,837 --> 00:45:39,545
Shit!

730
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,003
Kamla

731
00:45:48,087 --> 00:45:49,212
Kamla

732
00:45:51,087 --> 00:45:52,837
here careful, don't touch anything here.

733
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,753
If your heart is clean
nothing happens.

734
00:46:21,087 --> 00:46:22,295
Baby's breeched backward.

735
00:46:24,253 --> 00:46:25,128
Stethoscope.

736
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:32,045
Heartbeafs strong.

737
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:34,795
But I'm, I'm going to have to turn it.

738
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,087
Okay

739
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:40,587
I need some I need some air!

740
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:41,545
Get her out of here.

741
00:46:42,753 --> 00:46:45,753
Okay, tell her to relax these
muscles as much as she can.

742
00:46:45,837 --> 00:46:48,628
I'm gonna work from the outside and
the inside.

743
00:46:48,712 --> 00:46:50,212
Don't worry, you just every
thing'll be okay.

744
00:46:50,295 --> 00:46:51,545
No medication.

745
00:46:51,628 --> 00:46:54,253
It's gonna be a rollercoaster.

746
00:47:10,878 --> 00:47:11,587
No.

747
00:47:24,462 --> 00:47:25,420
Okay.

748
00:47:25,795 --> 00:47:26,670
Okay, Kamla.

749
00:47:30,628 --> 00:47:32,670
It's getting fainter
I can't hear the heartbeat.

750
00:47:33,295 --> 00:47:35,003
Max, I can't hear the heartbeat.

751
00:47:41,045 --> 00:47:43,253
Take her hand and squeeze
like hell now.

752
00:47:43,628 --> 00:47:44,378
Now!

753
00:47:44,462 --> 00:47:47,378
Joan, hold her hips.

754
00:47:47,462 --> 00:47:48,378
Hold her hips!

755
00:47:48,462 --> 00:47:50,295
Massage against me now.

756
00:47:50,378 --> 00:47:51,378
Massage against me.

757
00:47:51,462 --> 00:47:55,212
Don't die on me don't die please, don't me.

758
00:47:57,087 --> 00:48:01,170
Get some more hot water, quickly,
quickly, come on.

759
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:03,462
Don't worry, he's doing his best.

760
00:48:03,753 --> 00:48:04,170
Massage.

761
00:48:04,253 --> 00:48:05,003
Push, Meeta

762
00:48:05,087 --> 00:48:06,670
Wait, wait, wait, wait

763
00:48:06,753 --> 00:48:09,920
I've got it, I've got the head, wait!

764
00:48:10,003 --> 00:48:10,587
Wait.

765
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:11,753
Push push!

766
00:48:11,837 --> 00:48:15,878
It's coming it's coming.

767
00:48:17,962 --> 00:48:20,170
I got it--I got it.

768
00:48:21,378 --> 00:48:23,462
Lookee here it's a boy.

769
00:48:23,545 --> 00:48:25,212
It's a boy, lady.

770
00:48:25,295 --> 00:48:28,253
Hey little fella hiya little buddy.

771
00:48:28,712 --> 00:48:30,003
Please scream your heart out.

772
00:48:30,545 --> 00:48:31,087
There you go.

773
00:48:40,712 --> 00:48:41,670
...forceps.

774
00:48:52,045 --> 00:48:53,462
How is it, how is it?

775
00:48:53,545 --> 00:48:54,920
It' s a boy, daddy.

776
00:48:55,003 --> 00:48:56,462
And he's got all his stuff.

777
00:48:57,503 --> 00:48:59,628
What can you expect Said!

778
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:09,795
Your wife was incredible.

779
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:15,462
Kamla, you were absolutely

780
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:18,295
Thank you for your kind words.

781
00:49:19,587 --> 00:49:21,378
I was dearly blessed to marry her.

782
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:25,128
Have you birthed many babies?

783
00:49:27,087 --> 00:49:28,212
Not for a long time.

784
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:50,712
Max.

785
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:54,753
We desperately need a doctor here full time.

786
00:49:54,837 --> 00:49:55,337
Will you just

787
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:57,170
I'm sorry.

788
00:49:57,253 --> 00:50:00,837
Maybe you have it in you to be a saint,
Sister Joan, but it's just not my style.

789
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:03,170
Oh, so what are you going to be
when you grow up, doctor?

790
00:50:03,253 --> 00:50:04,670
Look, don't do that, lady!

791
00:50:04,753 --> 00:50:06,878
Don't patronise me because you are
on some goddam good do-gooder trip.

792
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:08,545
Don't you snarl at me or I'll
smack you upside the head.

793
00:50:08,628 --> 00:50:10,837
Don't do this!

794
00:50:12,545 --> 00:50:19,045
You know I don't even feel good
about what we did down there today.

795
00:50:19,128 --> 00:50:22,545
Bringing in another little mouth to feed
in this cesspool of a country

796
00:50:22,628 --> 00:50:23,462
Feel good!

797
00:50:23,545 --> 00:50:25,545
Who the hell cares if you feel good?

798
00:50:25,628 --> 00:50:27,212
What makes you so special?

799
00:50:27,295 --> 00:50:30,045
You're jusst another person like the
rest of us doing the beset you can to.

800
00:50:30,128 --> 00:50:32,878
...to tade care of yourself any too
bloody well as far as I can make out.

801
00:50:32,962 --> 00:50:35,545
Don't talk to me like you
think you know me,laby!

802
00:50:35,628 --> 00:50:37,462
Look, you need help

803
00:50:37,545 --> 00:50:39,045
Don't be a coward, ask for it.

804
00:50:39,128 --> 00:50:40,920
I don't need your help.

805
00:50:45,712 --> 00:50:47,087
Have a pleasant journey home, Max.

806
00:50:53,795 --> 00:50:54,837
Goodbye and god bless you.

807
00:51:07,212 --> 00:51:08,003
Mr Max.

808
00:51:10,045 --> 00:51:12,420
I -- I think you have a good heart.

809
00:51:19,795 --> 00:51:21,337
Thank you for...

810
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:24,253
...allowing me to be of use.

811
00:51:45,295 --> 00:51:48,378
I told you, my passport is lost in
the mail, but I can't believe...

812
00:51:48,462 --> 00:51:52,378
...it's going to take three weeks to
transfer a couple of hundred dollars.

813
00:51:52,462 --> 00:51:55,337
I just gave it to you.

814
00:51:56,212 --> 00:51:59,795
One-one-zero-zero-one-six-two.

815
00:51:59,878 --> 00:52:01,045
Two.

816
00:52:01,128 --> 00:52:04,962
I don't know, my visa...

817
00:52:05,045 --> 00:52:06,837
Hello?

818
00:52:07,378 --> 00:52:08,837
Goodbye!

819
00:52:09,295 --> 00:52:12,628
No dinero, no bucks for three weeks.

820
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:14,295
- This is driving me crazy
- Max...

821
00:52:14,378 --> 00:52:16,545
...the bill.

822
00:52:16,628 --> 00:52:18,462
I'll need you plane ticket.

823
00:52:18,545 --> 00:52:20,545
- My plane ticket.
- Yeah.

824
00:52:20,628 --> 00:52:22,212
It's just a little guarantee.

825
00:52:22,295 --> 00:52:27,462
With a face like mine
you don't trust me?

826
00:52:27,545 --> 00:52:30,045
- It's not a question of trust, Max.
- Oh, of course not.

827
00:52:30,128 --> 00:52:32,045
The government renuires foreign exchange.

828
00:52:32,128 --> 00:52:33,545
So it's the government's fault?

829
00:52:33,628 --> 00:52:37,045
My husband is a very strict man.

830
00:52:37,128 --> 00:52:40,378
And, er-- we have to tell your husband.

831
00:52:40,462 --> 00:52:42,545
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

832
00:52:42,628 --> 00:52:46,295
And there is absolutely no other way
out of this place?

833
00:52:46,378 --> 00:52:48,878
Hunched back camel--
burrow, nothing?

834
00:52:48,962 --> 00:52:50,795
No not until the bill is paid.

835
00:52:50,878 --> 00:52:54,003
Not until the bill is paid, all right.

836
00:52:54,378 --> 00:52:55,045
Here you go.

837
00:52:55,128 --> 00:52:56,712
Please take care of it.

838
00:52:56,795 --> 00:52:57,712
Can I leave this here?

839
00:52:57,795 --> 00:52:58,378
Mm-mm.

840
00:52:58,462 --> 00:52:59,587
Thank you.

841
00:53:01,878 --> 00:53:03,253
For you.

842
00:53:05,878 --> 00:53:06,545
...not contagious.

843
00:53:06,628 --> 00:53:07,795
I don't know that, all I know is...

844
00:53:07,878 --> 00:53:08,962
You don't know it, you don't know.

845
00:53:09,045 --> 00:53:10,128
You know nothing.

846
00:53:10,212 --> 00:53:10,795
Please, please...

847
00:53:10,878 --> 00:53:12,128
I've been vvoring with these
people for five years...

848
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:16,753
Let them go to hospital.

849
00:53:16,837 --> 00:53:18,212
Just a minute, just a minute, just a minute.

850
00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:19,295
You stay out of it!

851
00:53:19,378 --> 00:53:21,962
Listen-- just a minute.

852
00:53:22,045 --> 00:53:24,920
Leprosy is not infectious.

853
00:53:25,712 --> 00:53:27,545
I am leper.

854
00:53:27,628 --> 00:53:29,295
But my daughter...

855
00:53:29,378 --> 00:53:31,295
...but my daughter is not leper.

856
00:53:31,378 --> 00:53:33,295
Oh, I'm not interested in all that.

857
00:53:33,378 --> 00:53:35,378
All I know is that
lepers shouldn't come here.

858
00:53:36,837 --> 00:53:39,087
Joan Di. Joan Di.

859
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:40,087
Hello, Anouar.

860
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:41,837
Hello-- tell us

861
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:45,837
...Dotor Lowe was telling us-
that many of us could be helped.

862
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,587
...that all it would take-
is money for medication.

863
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:50,837
Please-- would you buy us
the medication?

864
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:53,170
Anouar, it, it'd cost a fortune.

865
00:53:53,253 --> 00:53:56,170
Well-- as we are not allowed to
come to the clinic...

866
00:53:56,253 --> 00:53:59,503
...then perhaps Doctor Lowe would
come visiting us occasionally.

867
00:53:59,587 --> 00:54:02,253
Anouar, Doctor Lowe is no longer a
part of this endeavour.

868
00:54:02,337 --> 00:54:04,420
There is only his cherished memory.

869
00:54:04,503 --> 00:54:08,128
...because I am having visions.

870
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:10,920
Good morning, good morning!

871
00:54:11,003 --> 00:54:12,628
Hell of a good morning.

872
00:54:13,753 --> 00:54:16,878
I may have the body of a sparrow
but I have the eyes of an eagle.

873
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:18,587
What are you doing, Sister Joan...

874
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:19,920
...practising medicine without a license?

875
00:54:20,003 --> 00:54:21,920
Oh God, junior, you're great.

876
00:54:22,003 --> 00:54:24,587
Oh, what a surprise!

877
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:27,753
Now don't get carried away,
I'm just here to get you organised.

878
00:54:27,837 --> 00:54:28,503
Will you shut up?

879
00:54:28,587 --> 00:54:29,587
What made you change your mind?

880
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:30,837
Well, I had a religious experience.
You see, I talked to Jesus to day...

881
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:33,962
Oh yeah, and I'm a bloody
bathing beauty.

882
00:54:34,503 --> 00:54:38,337
Actually-- I am temporarily
deprived of my plane ticket.

883
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:39,253
Ah...

884
00:54:39,337 --> 00:54:41,087
...so, how long am I stuck with you?

885
00:54:41,170 --> 00:54:43,795
Couple of weeks, till I get you organised.

886
00:54:44,253 --> 00:54:46,420
No, six months, not a day less.

887
00:54:46,503 --> 00:54:48,837
- You're crazy, lady.
- Not worth the aggravation.

888
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,003
One month and not a day more.

889
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:53,795
Three months-- and that's my
final offer.

890
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,920
Nine weeks-- or until my plane flies...

891
00:54:58,003 --> 00:54:59,962
...and that's my final offer.

892
00:55:00,587 --> 00:55:01,962
You're on.

893
00:55:02,253 --> 00:55:03,545
Olay, now sit down.

894
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:05,420
Here...

895
00:55:05,503 --> 00:55:06,795
...write.

896
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:10,253
We need detailed case histories...

897
00:55:10,337 --> 00:55:11,920
...we need an IV.

898
00:55:12,003 --> 00:55:14,753
Er, you need a truch load of broad
spectrum antibiotic...

899
00:55:14,837 --> 00:55:16,170
...pain killers...

900
00:55:16,253 --> 00:55:16,837
...basic vaccine...

901
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,462
God save me from knights
in shining armour.

902
00:55:23,253 --> 00:55:24,087
Hey!

903
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:24,962
Good morning, Doctor Max.

904
00:55:25,045 --> 00:55:26,878
- What are you doing?
- Good morning, doctor.

905
00:55:26,962 --> 00:55:28,003
Hi, Hasari.

906
00:55:28,378 --> 00:55:29,878
Er, Kamla...

907
00:55:29,962 --> 00:55:32,295
...I was wandering if you would
like to be my assistant.

908
00:55:32,378 --> 00:55:33,837
At the clinic, what do you think?

909
00:55:36,128 --> 00:55:37,295
Hasari...

910
00:55:37,378 --> 00:55:40,295
...I need Kamla as my assistant
at the clinic

911
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:41,795
Is it all right?

912
00:55:41,878 --> 00:55:43,212
You are staying here?

913
00:55:43,295 --> 00:55:45,420
Well-- for a bit.

914
00:55:45,712 --> 00:55:46,878
What do you think?

915
00:55:46,962 --> 00:55:47,628
Yeah.

916
00:55:47,712 --> 00:55:48,962
Yeah?

917
00:55:49,045 --> 00:55:49,545
Cool!

918
00:55:49,628 --> 00:55:51,045
All right.

919
00:55:51,128 --> 00:55:55,295
Twist and shout-- twist and shout.

920
00:55:55,378 --> 00:55:57,753
Come on, come on baby...

921
00:56:03,712 --> 00:56:05,003
Hasari, where have you been?

922
00:56:05,087 --> 00:56:06,753
I've been waiting almost five minutes.

923
00:56:06,837 --> 00:56:09,087
I'm sorry-- it was the traffic.

924
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:10,670
Oh no, mum, come.

925
00:56:12,795 --> 00:56:14,212
Oh, you're looking very different today.

926
00:56:14,295 --> 00:56:15,128
Yes.

927
00:56:15,212 --> 00:56:16,045
You not go to school?

928
00:56:16,128 --> 00:56:17,545
No, we are going baara bizarre.

929
00:56:17,628 --> 00:56:19,378
She is getting married, Hasari.

930
00:56:19,462 --> 00:56:22,920
Oh-- that's very nice.

931
00:56:24,128 --> 00:56:26,253
Soon I'll take her children to school.

932
00:56:39,878 --> 00:56:42,378
Hasari, you must remember
the shop where we are going.

933
00:56:42,462 --> 00:56:44,378
Because it is the nicest shop in the city.

934
00:56:44,462 --> 00:56:48,295
And when your daughter gets married--
you should, you should take her to this shop.

935
00:56:48,378 --> 00:56:49,128
Am I not right?

936
00:56:49,212 --> 00:56:51,295
Turn to the right please
and don't mind her.

937
00:56:51,378 --> 00:56:53,087
She's just a little chatterbox.

938
00:56:53,628 --> 00:56:55,295
But mama, you get such beautiful saris.

939
00:56:55,378 --> 00:56:56,587
Come on, let's get down.

940
00:56:59,378 --> 00:57:01,712
Dipti dear, how do you think he
can afford a shop like this?

941
00:57:01,795 --> 00:57:03,212
But mama, I didn't mean it.
Don't take it so seriously.

942
00:57:03,295 --> 00:57:05,212
That was very insensitive, my dear

943
00:57:05,295 --> 00:57:06,462
Mama, just look at the sari.

944
00:57:06,545 --> 00:57:07,462
Well, youy shouldn't say these things.

945
00:57:23,378 --> 00:57:26,795
One you know what I mean.
I said it again.

946
00:57:26,878 --> 00:57:28,795
One every two days, okay?

947
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:30,295
Understand---great.

948
00:57:30,378 --> 00:57:31,878
Only four hours to go, junior.

949
00:57:31,962 --> 00:57:34,170
Oh, go for it!

950
00:57:35,878 --> 00:57:38,212
Okay, little fella,
let's check you out.

951
00:57:38,295 --> 00:57:40,253
Let's check you out.
How are you doing?

952
00:57:40,545 --> 00:57:42,503
How are you doing?

953
00:57:42,878 --> 00:57:44,962
This baby's not gaining weight.

954
00:57:45,045 --> 00:57:49,087
Are you giving him the
extra milk we gave you?

955
00:57:54,295 --> 00:57:55,712
Some, not all.

956
00:57:55,795 --> 00:57:57,378
She's probably selling it.

957
00:57:57,462 --> 00:57:58,545
Selling it?

958
00:57:58,628 --> 00:57:59,962
Gotta pay the rent.

959
00:58:00,045 --> 00:58:00,962
On that dump?

960
00:58:01,045 --> 00:58:03,795
Well now Poomina's going to school
somebody's got to pay the rent.

961
00:58:03,878 --> 00:58:05,378
That's the way things work round here.

962
00:58:05,462 --> 00:58:08,503
I'm not liking the school to be in,
okay. From tomorrow I'll not go.

963
00:58:08,587 --> 00:58:10,087
I will go back to work...

964
00:58:10,170 --> 00:58:13,003
Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay, yo!

965
00:58:13,087 --> 00:58:15,545
We have the technology.

966
00:58:18,253 --> 00:58:21,087
Okey dokey.

967
00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:22,170
This.

968
00:58:22,253 --> 00:58:23,920
...Is the extra milk for the baby.

969
00:58:24,003 --> 00:58:26,920
And this is the extra
extra milk for the rent.

970
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:30,087
So it's very simple, give it to
the kid or I'll kill you.

971
00:58:30,170 --> 00:58:31,545
Thank you, sir.

972
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,253
And Poomina...

973
00:58:34,337 --> 00:58:37,420
you, young lady will stay in school.

974
00:58:37,503 --> 00:58:39,295
Come here little

975
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:42,045
You're gonna need all the luck you can get.

976
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:46,545
Gonna be a fireman
when he grows up.

977
00:58:47,003 --> 00:58:49,962
I get no respect.

978
00:58:56,170 --> 00:58:57,295
Hey!

979
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:04,212
Take me to 'Rifles' building.

980
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:19,087
Baba...

981
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:20,962
...I'm cooking, baba.

982
00:59:22,337 --> 00:59:23,878
I'm cooking rice,baba.

983
00:59:26,337 --> 00:59:27,170
Where's your mother?

984
00:59:27,253 --> 00:59:29,462
Careful go get me some water.

985
00:59:45,837 --> 00:59:47,545
Kamla, do you have any water in there?

986
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,337
I am fried!

987
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:50,837
Hasari.

988
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:54,170
Hasari, you have three fine
potential scholars here.

989
00:59:54,253 --> 00:59:57,670
This one will be ready for a proper
school in another couple of years.

990
00:59:57,753 --> 00:59:59,337
It's more than a father could hope.

991
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:02,003
Fifteen years from now, Dallas,
Texas, Doctor Manooj Pal.

992
01:00:04,295 --> 01:00:05,170
Thanks.

993
01:00:05,795 --> 01:00:08,878
Joan we can't keep going out to
that leper colony, it's wasting...

994
01:00:08,962 --> 01:00:10,462
...like what, two hours a day walking.

995
01:00:10,545 --> 01:00:11,295
I know but

996
01:00:11,378 --> 01:00:12,795
Well Poomina...

997
01:00:12,878 --> 01:00:14,628
where have you been, young lady?

998
01:00:14,712 --> 01:00:15,878
You should be in school!

999
01:00:15,962 --> 01:00:17,837
I know who this is from.

1000
01:00:20,378 --> 01:00:22,087
It's a summons to see 'himself

1001
01:00:23,045 --> 01:00:26,378
Now Mr Ghatak, I understand
there should be an increase in rent

1002
01:00:26,462 --> 01:00:28,045
if we have larger quaters, but

1003
01:00:28,128 --> 01:00:30,378
I don't see why we should have to
pay more protection.

1004
01:00:30,462 --> 01:00:33,795
More people, more problems
the strangers.

1005
01:00:33,878 --> 01:00:36,962
And if I don't charge you
what will I tell others?

1006
01:00:37,045 --> 01:00:38,587
We can't afford it!

1007
01:00:40,545 --> 01:00:43,128
If you can expand, you can
afford to pay more.

1008
01:00:43,337 --> 01:00:47,628
Excuse me, sir, this isn't a
drinking den, this is a free clinic.

1009
01:00:53,087 --> 01:00:55,295
You are from a rich country, doctor.

1010
01:00:56,420 --> 01:01:00,128
For you money is a piece of paper
with which you buy something you want.

1011
01:01:01,337 --> 01:01:02,462
For me it's a wall.

1012
01:01:03,170 --> 01:01:04,128
A beautiful wall.

1013
01:01:04,587 --> 01:01:06,087
A protective wall.

1014
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:10,295
A wall that separates me from
the degradation oh the other side.

1015
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:13,878
This wall is my achievement,
Miss Bethel.

1016
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:15,878
I am proud of it.

1017
01:01:16,253 --> 01:01:18,003
And what you don't understand is...

1018
01:01:18,087 --> 01:01:22,003
...that those poor souls on the other side...

1019
01:01:22,087 --> 01:01:24,462
...they are also proud of it.

1020
01:01:25,087 --> 01:01:26,587
Do you understand?

1021
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:28,295
Oh yes.

1022
01:01:29,253 --> 01:01:30,378
Please sit down.
Please sit down.

1023
01:01:40,670 --> 01:01:41,670
So...

1024
01:01:41,753 --> 01:01:45,253
...you wish to start the treatment
of lepers,hmm?

1025
01:01:45,337 --> 01:01:46,337
Yes.

1026
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:49,087
But your neighbours are simple, not educated.

1027
01:01:49,170 --> 01:01:51,003
They won't tolerate lepers.

1028
01:01:51,087 --> 01:01:51,837
They'll change.

1029
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:52,920
Change?

1030
01:01:53,003 --> 01:01:55,295
You are a romantic,
Miss Bethel.

1031
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:58,587
I've learned not to
trust those who say...

1032
01:01:58,670 --> 01:02:01,587
...they do things for the benefit of others.

1033
01:02:04,587 --> 01:02:08,670
Man can be tamed by having
an abundance or by having nothing.

1034
01:02:08,753 --> 01:02:11,920
Who is rebellious?
Who is disobedient?

1035
01:02:12,003 --> 01:02:14,878
Those who have only a little.

1036
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:16,420
So..

1037
01:02:16,503 --> 01:02:18,503
...If there isn't enough for all...

1038
01:02:18,587 --> 01:02:21,170
...it's best that people have nothing.

1039
01:02:21,253 --> 01:02:23,170
My children...

1040
01:02:23,253 --> 01:02:25,962
...bask in the light of my strength.

1041
01:02:26,587 --> 01:02:29,045
It brings--stability.

1042
01:02:35,253 --> 01:02:38,003
But I burden my children carefully.

1043
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:39,795
Kindly.

1044
01:02:40,837 --> 01:02:48,962
Reading their faces adding
to their burden in tiny increments.

1045
01:02:50,837 --> 01:02:52,170
So...

1046
01:02:52,253 --> 01:02:54,003
...tranquility...

1047
01:02:54,087 --> 01:02:57,378
...an end to pointless aggression.

1048
01:03:01,503 --> 01:03:04,837
You really ought to give up
thinking, doctor.

1049
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:07,712
Learn to enjoy yourself.

1050
01:03:08,170 --> 01:03:10,087
Have some--pastries, Miss Bethel.

1051
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:11,420
Thank you.

1052
01:03:11,503 --> 01:03:13,420
I'm sure we can provide the means.

1053
01:03:13,503 --> 01:03:16,628
To remove those coulds from your forehead.

1054
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:21,795
Don't offer me candy!

1055
01:03:23,503 --> 01:03:24,795
What are you trying to do, bride mel?

1056
01:03:26,128 --> 01:03:27,795
Get your hands...

1057
01:03:27,878 --> 01:03:28,462
Stop!

1058
01:03:28,545 --> 01:03:30,587
Stop.

1059
01:03:32,295 --> 01:03:33,253
Take those boys away.

1060
01:03:35,962 --> 01:03:37,170
Get out--get out!

1061
01:03:41,545 --> 01:03:43,295
What in the name of God
do you think you're doing?

1062
01:03:43,378 --> 01:03:45,253
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

1063
01:03:45,628 --> 01:03:47,128
With me, any duplicity's possible.

1064
01:03:47,212 --> 01:03:48,712
What was all that about?

1065
01:03:48,795 --> 01:03:49,878
Nothing, just a...

1066
01:03:49,962 --> 01:03:52,003
...little--low family joke.

1067
01:03:56,128 --> 01:03:57,670
Stop it--stop it!

1068
01:03:57,753 --> 01:03:59,545
Leave me alone you silly--eejit.

1069
01:04:02,503 --> 01:04:04,878
I think we have to break the godfather's
hold on us.

1070
01:04:05,837 --> 01:04:08,337
That's exactly what I'm saying.

1071
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:10,753
We have to be cautious,
this is not the most appropriate time.

1072
01:04:10,837 --> 01:04:13,587
Oh come on, Sunil, how do you
proceed with caution against someone...

1073
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:16,337
...who considers you a chicken with
a weight around your neck?

1074
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:17,420
You want to change things...

1075
01:04:17,503 --> 01:04:18,587
you have to risk.

1076
01:04:18,670 --> 01:04:21,670
Look, you back off this ,you
compromise with this guy...

1077
01:04:21,753 --> 01:04:23,253
...and he will eat you alive.

1078
01:04:23,337 --> 01:04:25,087
You, you can stand up.

1079
01:04:25,170 --> 01:04:26,253
But we can't do
that, we live here.

1080
01:04:26,337 --> 01:04:28,587
I'm telling you if you stand up
he will back off,I guarantee it.

1081
01:04:28,670 --> 01:04:31,003
Max, this is not one of your
American gangster TV shows, you know.

1082
01:04:31,087 --> 01:04:31,295
Let me ask you something, let me askyou

1083
01:04:31,378 --> 01:04:32,378
something, Max, now...

1084
01:04:32,462 --> 01:04:32,962
HOW

1085
01:04:33,045 --> 01:04:34,545
this is a self help society.

1086
01:04:34,628 --> 01:04:35,212
So help yourself.

1087
01:04:35,295 --> 01:04:36,045
So, so...

1088
01:04:36,128 --> 01:04:36,712
are we

1089
01:04:36,795 --> 01:04:38,212
not getting swept up with your thing

1090
01:04:38,295 --> 01:04:38,587
here?

1091
01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:40,170
I take of fence to that, saint
Joan.

1092
01:04:40,253 --> 01:04:41,253
Ah well, I'm sorry you're so

1093
01:04:41,337 --> 01:04:42,503
sensitive but this, this is too

1094
01:04:42,587 --> 01:04:43,503
important to piss about.

1095
01:04:43,587 --> 01:04:44,753
It's hard to know when to trust you.

1096
01:04:44,837 --> 01:04:46,503
I mean, you're, you're angry with everything.

1097
01:04:46,587 --> 01:04:47,670
You ain't seen nothing yet.

1098
01:04:47,753 --> 01:04:49,837
And you can afford to talk like this because.

1099
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:50,587
...you're not

1100
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:52,795
going to be here tomorrow, you're
going home.

1101
01:04:54,337 --> 01:04:56,503
I am here!

1102
01:04:56,587 --> 01:05:01,420
Max, we should think
thrice before we do anything.

1103
01:05:01,503 --> 01:05:02,503
For Ghatak is...

1104
01:05:02,587 --> 01:05:03,795
...is the saviour here.

1105
01:05:03,878 --> 01:05:05,295
He has given us the jobs.

1106
01:05:05,378 --> 01:05:06,545
Saviour.

1107
01:05:06,628 --> 01:05:08,128
Hasari -- isn't it '2

1108
01:05:08,212 --> 01:05:09,628
Come on, speak out.

1109
01:05:09,712 --> 01:05:11,670
See, he's given me a job.

1110
01:05:12,212 --> 01:05:13,670
And I've been eating his salt.

1111
01:05:14,045 --> 01:05:16,045
So what -- you're paying for it...

1112
01:05:16,128 --> 01:05:19,045
And I promised him to remain loyal...

1113
01:05:19,128 --> 01:05:20,920
Let him speak!

1114
01:05:21,295 --> 01:05:21,795
Now...

1115
01:05:21,878 --> 01:05:23,462
...you know, it's, it's difficult...

1116
01:05:23,545 --> 01:05:25,462
...tO...

1117
01:05:25,545 --> 01:05:27,795
I, I hope you understand Joan Di.

1118
01:05:27,878 --> 01:05:30,045
I don't understand you people,
you're acting like sheep.

1119
01:05:30,128 --> 01:05:33,295
You bow your heads and take this
nightmare like you have no choice.

1120
01:05:33,378 --> 01:05:34,378
But I'm telling you...

1121
01:05:34,462 --> 01:05:38,795
...if you don't stop this asshole now he will
ruin you for the rest of your lives.

1122
01:05:38,878 --> 01:05:42,712
Ashish, Ashish, when Ghatak's son
came into my shop he beat my son up...

1123
01:05:42,795 --> 01:05:44,295
May I be allowed to speak?

1124
01:05:44,378 --> 01:05:45,462
Just a minute, Kamla wants to say
something.

1125
01:05:54,087 --> 01:05:55,545
Now you want to speak.

1126
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,420
It's only because this is our home now.

1127
01:05:58,503 --> 01:06:00,795
We've never know such friends.

1128
01:06:01,337 --> 01:06:03,837
I think the god father
is strong.

1129
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,087
And could kill us.

1130
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:08,587
But we must choose.

1131
01:06:08,670 --> 01:06:11,920
Maxis, is only trying to help all of us

1132
01:06:12,003 --> 01:06:14,212
and we should support him.

1133
01:06:15,253 --> 01:06:17,045
I think we should stand up.

1134
01:06:17,503 --> 01:06:19,170
Well

1135
01:06:19,253 --> 01:06:20,837
I've got a property

1136
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:23,628
which I could let out.

1137
01:06:24,170 --> 01:06:26,337
Say two hundred and fifty
rupees a month.

1138
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:29,462
But not a rupee less!

1139
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:28,545
Those goras are going to build
a new clinic on someone else's property.

1140
01:07:30,670 --> 01:07:31,962
But they won't pay protection.

1141
01:07:34,003 --> 01:07:35,087
I think the doctor must go.

1142
01:07:35,628 --> 01:07:37,337
How many times

1143
01:07:37,628 --> 01:07:39,670
a heart beats in a man's lifetime?

1144
01:07:42,045 --> 01:07:43,087
I have calculated it

1145
01:07:45,295 --> 01:07:46,420
two billion times.

1146
01:07:47,295 --> 01:07:48,045
Very few.

1147
01:07:55,253 --> 01:07:55,462
The woman

1148
01:07:56,587 --> 01:07:57,878
the nurse she is okay.

1149
01:07:59,587 --> 01:08:00,795
The doctor

1150
01:08:01,670 --> 01:08:02,795
American doctor.

1151
01:08:03,170 --> 01:08:04,253
He should go.

1152
01:08:04,337 --> 01:08:05,503
He should go now.

1153
01:08:05,587 --> 01:08:07,420
I'm ill I'm sick!

1154
01:08:07,503 --> 01:08:09,545
I can't be bothered about it now.

1155
01:08:15,753 --> 01:08:16,962
Are they going to bring in the lepers?

1156
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:19,962
- Yes.
- Yes.

1157
01:08:20,045 --> 01:08:20,628
Yes!

1158
01:08:20,712 --> 01:08:21,753
Good.

1159
01:08:22,045 --> 01:08:24,003
Let them climb well out on the branch.

1160
01:08:24,962 --> 01:08:26,920
Then we'll out it.

1161
01:08:34,128 --> 01:08:35,503
When I' m gone

1162
01:08:36,295 --> 01:08:37,920
...who will you be loyal to '2

1163
01:09:07,462 --> 01:09:11,587
Sorry
I didn't realise it was you.

1164
01:09:11,670 --> 01:09:13,378
Your father, babu.

1165
01:09:13,753 --> 01:09:15,628
Remember loyalty.

1166
01:09:50,003 --> 01:09:52,712
The godfather has made our
life possible here.

1167
01:09:54,503 --> 01:09:55,628
We shouldn't anger him.

1168
01:09:56,837 --> 01:09:58,962
I think we can trust Max daddah.

1169
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:01,045
He'll stand by us.

1170
01:10:34,170 --> 01:10:36,045
You know you are very beautiful.

1171
01:10:40,753 --> 01:10:42,045
Oh, Kamla

1172
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:45,712
What about the children?

1173
01:10:46,170 --> 01:10:47,628
We won't make noise.

1174
01:11:18,962 --> 01:11:20,378
Max, is this going to be your room?

1175
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:22,795
No Joan Di's room.

1176
01:11:26,587 --> 01:11:28,712
Is this fun?

1177
01:11:29,087 --> 01:11:31,170
No.

1178
01:11:31,253 --> 01:11:33,295
Look, Max

1179
01:11:33,670 --> 01:11:35,170
honestly

1180
01:11:35,795 --> 01:11:38,295
I didn't know all this would work.

1181
01:11:38,378 --> 01:11:40,795
But it has.

1182
01:11:40,837 --> 01:11:43,295
Now all you need is a Indian bride.

1183
01:11:43,378 --> 01:11:45,212
Oh yeah, and you're gonna pick her?

1184
01:11:45,295 --> 01:11:46,170
Get outta town!

1185
01:11:47,295 --> 01:11:49,212
God, I never thought this day would come

1186
01:11:49,295 --> 01:11:51,628
and yous all worked your socks off and

1187
01:11:51,712 --> 01:11:55,128
I wish I had some champagne, but
we haven't so we've got some sweets.

1188
01:11:55,212 --> 01:11:56,878
Everyone can come to the new clinic.

1189
01:11:56,962 --> 01:11:59,795
And I declare it officially open.

1190
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,670
Hey, Manooj!

1191
01:12:23,462 --> 01:12:24,170
Amrita.

1192
01:12:24,253 --> 01:12:25,795
Baba.

1193
01:12:26,087 --> 01:12:27,128
Excuse me, can I go?

1194
01:12:32,253 --> 01:12:33,462
Baba.

1195
01:12:38,503 --> 01:12:39,545
Hurry UP-

1196
01:12:41,670 --> 01:12:42,712
Bye.

1197
01:13:09,295 --> 01:13:10,837
Good news?

1198
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:11,962
Job back home.

1199
01:13:15,170 --> 01:13:18,670
Could you

1200
01:13:18,712 --> 01:13:20,837
Oh my God, lepers.

1201
01:13:20,878 --> 01:13:22,837
Put these in my box.

1202
01:13:22,878 --> 01:13:24,587
Well there goes the neighbourhood.

1203
01:13:24,670 --> 01:13:27,420
Sshhh you barbarian!

1204
01:13:27,503 --> 01:13:29,670
We are trying not to be lepers.

1205
01:13:29,753 --> 01:13:32,837
Oh I didn't get the concept.
Of course, not lepers.

1206
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:33,920
You had me fooled.

1207
01:13:34,003 --> 01:13:35,503
Since it is a special day.

1208
01:13:35,587 --> 01:13:39,170
We are taking you to the
clinic in grand style.

1209
01:13:39,253 --> 01:13:41,128
Oh, you are, let's go!

1210
01:13:42,712 --> 01:13:45,920
Meeta is very excited by this
ride through Calcutta.

1211
01:13:46,003 --> 01:13:46,837
She has never been

1212
01:13:46,878 --> 01:13:48,003
sightseeing before.

1213
01:13:48,087 --> 01:13:50,420
Oh Anouar, you are incorrigible.

1214
01:13:50,503 --> 01:13:52,337
I know, I'm very encouraging.

1215
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:54,795
You're very that's not what I said.

1216
01:14:25,753 --> 01:14:28,420
Hey Poomina, where have you been hiding, huh?

1217
01:14:28,462 --> 01:14:29,337
Huh?

1218
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:30,837
Hello, Poomina,
an old friend wants to see you.

1219
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:32,003
- I have to go with my friend I can't go.
- You come with us.

1220
01:14:32,087 --> 01:14:34,003
- I have to go with them.
- Come on.

1221
01:14:34,087 --> 01:14:35,462
I've got to go with them.

1222
01:14:54,837 --> 01:14:55,878
O

1223
01:14:56,587 --> 01:14:57,878

1224
01:15:02,253 --> 01:15:04,712
Ah, little Poomina you have new friends now.

1225
01:15:07,128 --> 01:15:08,462
And they like you, huh?

1226
01:15:10,503 --> 01:15:11,795
And they like your smile.

1227
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:28,170
My God, we've got a crazy man driving.

1228
01:15:33,295 --> 01:15:35,962

1229
01:15:36,045 --> 01:15:39,045

men are attacking the lepers.

1230
01:15:39,128 --> 01:15:43,212
Hey, what, what's going on?

1231
01:15:43,295 --> 01:15:45,503
Hasari what's happening?

1232
01:15:46,378 --> 01:15:48,003
What's wrong?

1233
01:15:48,378 --> 01:15:50,295
Take Anouar.

1234
01:15:50,378 --> 01:15:51,628
Hasari, what's going on?

1235

1239
01:16:12,462 --> 01:16:13,670
Take them inside.

1240
01:16:13,712 --> 01:16:14,253

01:18:17,670 --> 01:18:19,003
So by all means protect us.

1281
01:18:25,545 --> 01:18:26,753
Rickshaw wallah!

1282
01:18:27,295 --> 01:18:28,545
Tomorrow.

1283
01:18:28,628 --> 01:18:29,920
Come and see me.

1284
01:18:57,545 --> 01:18:58,628
Will she

1285
01:18:58,712 --> 01:18:59,628
will her face be all right?

1286
01:18:59,712 --> 01:19:02,045
She is going to be absolutely beautiful.

1287
01:19:02,128 --> 01:19:04,212
And if you do exactly what I say

1288
01:19:04,295 --> 01:19:07,337
and don't open it up again you're not
even going to see a scar, sweetheart.

1289
01:19:08,045 --> 01:19:09,628
But you're going to have to stay here, do
you understand?

1290
01:19:09,712 --> 01:19:11,045
Huh?

1291
01:19:11,128 --> 01:19:12,545
Joan, you're gonna have
to make her stay here.

1292
01:19:12,628 --> 01:19:13,378
I'll try.

1293
01:19:13,462 --> 01:19:15,087
You don't goddam try, you do it!

1294
01:19:16,545 --> 01:19:17,712
God I hate this place.

1295
01:19:17,795 --> 01:19:20,170
I hate this place. I hate this place.

1296
01:19:21,628 --> 01:19:23,087
Almost done, sweetheart.

1297
01:19:25,212 --> 01:19:26,087
Almost done.

1298
01:19:35,128 --> 01:19:36,337
What have you got to say?

1299
01:19:37,128 --> 01:19:41,378
I told them your father provides us
with a great deal and

1300
01:19:41,462 --> 01:19:45,170
and I, I had promised
him that I will remain loyal.

1301
01:19:45,462 --> 01:19:46,878
You're off the list.

1302
01:19:46,962 --> 01:19:48,503
Leave your rickshaw here.

1303
01:19:52,962 --> 01:19:53,795
Babu

1304
01:19:53,878 --> 01:19:54,378
please.

1305
01:19:54,462 --> 01:19:57,878
Your rickshaw will be reserved for
people who deserve our trust.

1306
01:19:57,962 --> 01:19:58,545
Go.

1307
01:19:58,628 --> 01:20:00,295
Babu, I, I, I'll be ruined.

1308
01:20:00,378 --> 01:20:04,128
This is as if the ground has opened

1309
01:20:04,212 --> 01:20:05,628
I have to speak to Mr Ghatak.

1310
01:20:05,712 --> 01:20:06,878
Mr Ghatak!

1311
01:20:06,962 --> 01:20:08,170
Mr Ghatak!

1312
01:20:08,962 --> 01:20:13,087
Please let me talk to baba, babu.

1313
01:20:14,545 --> 01:20:15,503
My father is ill.

1314
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:17,170
I'm making the decisions.

1315
01:20:21,253 --> 01:20:22,753
My decision is final.

1316
01:20:25,378 --> 01:20:26,503
Now go.

1317
01:20:27,295 --> 01:20:29,670
Or do you want him to break your fingers?

1318
01:20:31,462 --> 01:20:32,378
Please listen

1319
01:20:32,462 --> 01:20:34,212
please let me

1320
01:20:34,295 --> 01:20:35,503
please let me talk to

1321
01:20:35,587 --> 01:20:43,712
babu

1322
01:20:46,837 --> 01:20:48,462
Please let me explain

1323
01:21:08,837 --> 01:21:11,003
I quit, I should have stayed quit.

1324
01:21:11,087 --> 01:21:13,670
I became a doctor because my
goddam father was a doctor.

1325
01:21:13,712 --> 01:21:15,670
I played football because he
played football.

1326
01:21:15,753 --> 01:21:19,170
I ran for class president because my
daddy was class president.

1327
01:21:19,253 --> 01:21:20,253
And I'm done with it.

1328
01:21:20,337 --> 01:21:21,420
Listen to me, Max.

1329
01:21:21,503 --> 01:21:23,753
If you want to leave, tell us to go and
stuff ourselves

1330
01:21:23,837 --> 01:21:25,503
but don't try and blame
anybody except yourself.

1331
01:21:25,587 --> 01:21:27,378
All right then, I quit.

1332
01:21:27,670 --> 01:21:30,212
I have given you light years
more than I planned.

1333
01:21:30,462 --> 01:21:31,920
I am not magic Max

1334
01:21:32,003 --> 01:21:34,670
and I will not be invested in these
people, with their needs

1335
01:21:34,753 --> 01:21:36,670
and their clinging and their desperation.

1336
01:21:36,712 --> 01:21:38,087
It's just too goddam painfull!

1337
01:21:38,170 --> 01:21:40,337
That's what it is working
with people, painful.

1338
01:21:40,420 --> 01:21:43,587
And it's a struggle not to lose
compassion or humanity

1339
01:21:43,670 --> 01:21:45,420
but it's a struggle we can't afford to lose.

1340
01:21:45,503 --> 01:21:46,587
Oh, bullshit.

1341
01:21:46,670 --> 01:21:48,212
Ghatak is right.

1342
01:21:48,503 --> 01:21:51,628
People are just out for themselves and
everything else is a fraud.

1343
01:21:54,587 --> 01:21:55,670
O

1344
01:21:55,753 --> 01:21:57,295
What are you, saint Joan?

1345
01:21:59,253 --> 01:22:00,420
Are you a fool or a fraud?

1346
01:22:00,503 --> 01:22:01,753
Both.

1347
01:22:01,837 --> 01:22:03,337
Both of those.

1348
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:05,420
But I'm here because I want to be here.

1349
01:22:05,503 --> 01:22:09,378
Max, maybe the world was meant
to break your heart.

1350
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:12,337
From the moment we're born, we're shipwrecked

1351
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:13,753
struggling between hope and despair.

1352
01:22:13,837 --> 01:22:15,670
Oh God

1353
01:22:15,753 --> 01:22:17,378
All of us.

1354
01:22:24,545 --> 01:22:26,378
God junior.

1355
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:39,712
Not everyone's out out for this, you know.

1356
01:22:41,587 --> 01:22:43,337
You did the very best you could.

1357
01:22:43,378 --> 01:22:44,087
No, no

1358
01:22:44,170 --> 01:22:44,837
Better than most.

1359
01:22:44,920 --> 01:22:45,920
No I did not, lady.

1360
01:22:46,003 --> 01:22:47,628
I messed up real bad.

1361
01:22:48,003 --> 01:22:49,670
You're only human, Max.

1362
01:22:49,753 --> 01:22:52,587
Yeah, I khow. Let us, let us not ever forget

1363
01:22:52,628 --> 01:22:55,087
what is it, er, run, spectate, commit.

1364
01:22:55,170 --> 01:22:56,795
Running, spectator.

1365
01:22:58,170 --> 01:23:00,878
Whatever they are.

1366
01:23:00,962 --> 01:23:03,337
The more you run the harder they'll chase you.

1367
01:23:03,712 --> 01:23:05,587
Oh goddam.

1368
01:23:18,962 --> 01:23:20,253
They took away my rickshaw.

1369
01:23:23,795 --> 01:23:26,587
So what do you want me to do about it,
get it back for you?

1370
01:23:30,378 --> 01:23:31,753
But we trusted you.

1371
01:23:34,045 --> 01:23:35,337
I guess that was your mistake, huh?

1372
01:23:45,212 --> 01:23:46,337
They took away my rickshaw.

1373
01:23:51,212 --> 01:23:53,462
You will have nothing to do with these people

1374
01:23:53,545 --> 01:23:55,045
Or that clinic any more.

1375
01:23:55,128 --> 01:23:56,753
Hasari, please, what I will earn
will be for you and me.

1376
01:23:56,837 --> 01:23:58,253
Sshhh, lie down quickly, lie down.
Go to sleep come on, lie down.

1377
01:23:58,295 --> 01:23:59,420
How will I get a job now?

1378
01:23:59,503 --> 01:24:00,837
Sshhh, go to sleep, close your eyes.

1379
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:02,212
How will I put food in your mouths?

1380
01:24:14,753 --> 01:24:16,295
We have what you saved for my dowry.

1381
01:24:46,003 --> 01:24:46,878
Take some more.

1382
01:25:00,753 --> 01:25:01,670
Take this one.

1383
01:25:01,753 --> 01:25:02,712
This one too.

1384
01:25:14,087 --> 01:25:14,962
Hasari?

1385
01:25:23,628 --> 01:25:24,587
Hello, Hasari.

1386
01:25:28,295 --> 01:25:29,670
You didn't go to work today?

1387
01:25:30,003 --> 01:25:31,670
It was a morrning shift, baba.

1388
01:25:32,545 --> 01:25:33,837
I bought some food.

1389
01:25:42,962 --> 01:25:44,545
Hasari, look

1390
01:25:44,587 --> 01:25:45,295
I know you feel

1391
01:25:45,378 --> 01:25:48,295
I let you down but don't punish Kamla.

1392
01:25:48,378 --> 01:25:50,795
What happened is between you and me.

1393
01:25:50,837 --> 01:25:52,920
And we need her at the clinic.

1394
01:25:54,003 --> 01:25:56,253
Oh Hasari, please!

1395
01:26:12,545 --> 01:26:14,795
The clinic is for everyone.

1396
01:26:14,837 --> 01:26:16,337
And I think they'll pay me.

1397
01:26:16,712 --> 01:26:18,628
No more clinic!

1398
01:26:18,712 --> 01:26:20,545
I'm your husband

1399
01:26:20,628 --> 01:26:22,920
and you will do what I will say.

1400
01:26:23,962 --> 01:26:25,212
Stay away from him.

1401
01:26:26,128 --> 01:26:27,503
He is not one of us.

1402
01:26:27,878 --> 01:26:29,295
This is not his home.

1403
01:26:29,337 --> 01:26:32,045
He's a he's tree with on roots.

1404
01:26:32,128 --> 01:26:32,878
NO, but he is

1405
01:26:32,962 --> 01:26:35,545
He will only be good to
you as long as you please him.

1406
01:26:35,587 --> 01:26:37,295
That is just not true Hasari.

1407
01:26:37,378 --> 01:26:40,045
Please, don't teach me what is true.

1408
01:26:41,253 --> 01:26:43,045
Just leave us alone.

1409
01:26:45,337 --> 01:26:46,378
I've lost my rickshaw.

1410
01:26:47,045 --> 01:26:48,503
I've lost my livelihood.

1411
01:26:48,587 --> 01:26:50,795
I don't know what is going to happen to us.

1412
01:27:03,170 --> 01:27:03,753
Max.

1413
01:27:03,795 --> 01:27:05,628
I have something confidential to ask you.

1414
01:27:05,712 --> 01:27:10,295
This disease of ours it is not a visitation
for our past sins

1415
01:27:10,378 --> 01:27:11,378
but an illness, yes?

1416
01:27:11,462 --> 01:27:12,545
Right.

1417
01:27:12,628 --> 01:27:13,837
I want to start a workshop.

1418
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,712
We have weavers and carpenters.

1419
01:27:15,795 --> 01:27:18,045
We could weave cloth instead of begging.

1420
01:27:18,128 --> 01:27:19,378
Anouar, it's a good idea but I

1421
01:27:19,420 --> 01:27:23,045
Listen Max I know about this godfather,
he's a clever man.

1422
01:27:23,128 --> 01:27:25,045
He has got everyone
to turn their backs on you.

1423
01:27:25,128 --> 01:27:29,212
But I can show you how to get your way
back into their hearts.

1424
01:27:29,295 --> 01:27:30,878
That is why I want you to follow me.

1425
01:27:30,962 --> 01:27:32,212
Please, I show you something.

1426
01:27:32,295 --> 01:27:32,878
What is it?

1427
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:34,420
You will see it come on.

1428
01:27:45,378 --> 01:27:46,753
You devil!

1429
01:27:46,837 --> 01:27:47,587
You stole it?

1430
01:27:47,670 --> 01:27:49,128
No, sahib.

1431
01:27:49,503 --> 01:27:50,087
Where'd you get it?

1432
01:27:50,170 --> 01:27:51,503
The police, sahib.

1433
01:27:51,587 --> 01:27:52,670
And, er

1434
01:27:52,712 --> 01:27:54,545
we have borrowed it from the police.

1435
01:27:59,253 --> 01:28:00,712
Ta-da.

1436
01:28:02,837 --> 01:28:05,420
It's great. I konw it's a little
ratty but

1437
01:28:05,503 --> 01:28:07,503
I'm good with my hands,
you're good with your so,

1438
01:28:07,587 --> 01:28:09,128
we can make it good as new.

1439
01:28:10,087 --> 01:28:11,545
What do you think.

1440
01:28:19,045 --> 01:28:20,420
Well?

1441
01:28:21,462 --> 01:28:24,212
If I go out on the streets
with this machine

1442
01:28:24,295 --> 01:28:26,170
I'll die in the gutter with my throat cut.

1443
01:28:26,253 --> 01:28:27,253
No you won't .

1444
01:28:27,337 --> 01:28:29,587
Because the license the cops.

1445
01:28:29,670 --> 01:28:32,003
That can all be fixed
with bribes or something.

1446
01:28:32,087 --> 01:28:35,795
And as far as the godfather's concerned,
we just don't work in his area.

1447
01:28:35,878 --> 01:28:38,253
And we have nothing to do with
the sucker, here.

1448
01:28:41,795 --> 01:28:44,920
So please take it.

1449
01:28:45,962 --> 01:28:47,337
Please.

1450
01:28:53,087 --> 01:28:55,045
Oh goddam, Hasari!

1451
01:28:55,128 --> 01:28:57,878
Doctor Max, you you don't understand.

1452
01:28:57,962 --> 01:28:59,545
Tell me.

1453
01:28:59,628 --> 01:29:02,462
You are a gora a white man.

1454
01:29:02,503 --> 01:29:05,170
You're you're different.

1455
01:29:05,670 --> 01:29:08,045
You you think you can buy people's

1456
01:29:08,128 --> 01:29:10,378
hearts by giving them things.

1457
01:29:10,462 --> 01:29:13,628
Building clinics being a big man.

1458
01:29:13,962 --> 01:29:15,462
For me trust is in the heart.

1459
01:29:16,753 --> 01:29:19,712
And that is something
which cannot be purchased.

1460
01:29:19,795 --> 01:29:22,712
Purchased is that what you think?

1461
01:29:22,795 --> 01:29:24,003
Is that what you really feel?

1462
01:29:24,628 --> 01:29:26,003
All right.

1463
01:29:26,795 --> 01:29:27,837
All right.

1464
01:29:30,795 --> 01:29:32,878
Look, I'm a small man.

1465
01:29:32,962 --> 01:29:33,712
No, shit!

1466
01:29:33,753 --> 01:29:36,503
Born small and that's my fate.

1467
01:29:37,128 --> 01:29:40,295
And I will not allow you again
to tempt me with big thoughts.

1468
01:29:40,378 --> 01:29:42,128
Oh no no, sir.

1469
01:29:42,212 --> 01:29:43,378
Uh-uh.

1470
01:29:43,462 --> 01:29:45,212
Small ain't the word for you, pal

1471
01:29:45,253 --> 01:29:46,628
You are a little brown

1472
01:29:46,712 --> 01:29:48,628
illiterate gutless victim.

1473
01:29:48,712 --> 01:29:51,462
And you should take all this crap from
the cops and the gangsters.

1474
01:29:51,503 --> 01:29:54,628
And you should keep on locking up your wife
being suspicious

1475
01:29:54,712 --> 01:29:56,878
being jealous for no goddam reason.

1476
01:29:56,962 --> 01:29:58,628
You have no right to say such things to me.

1477
01:29:58,670 --> 01:30:00,545
Well then go ahead, stop me.
Come on goddam it!

1478
01:30:00,628 --> 01:30:02,378
DO it!

1479
01:30:02,462 --> 01:30:05,462
Hasari I did not do this all on my own

1480
01:30:05,545 --> 01:30:07,545
You participated too.

1481
01:30:07,628 --> 01:30:11,087
And did I take your goddam rickshaw
did I make you live in this shit hole'?

1482
01:30:11,170 --> 01:30:12,545
No!

1483
01:30:13,753 --> 01:30:15,503
So if you want to be pissed at me

1484
01:30:15,587 --> 01:30:17,462
go ahead, that's fine.

1485
01:30:18,087 --> 01:30:22,128
But you should get pissed at the people who
are really using you.

1486
01:30:22,837 --> 01:30:24,128
Do you know what I think?

1487
01:30:25,128 --> 01:30:27,253
I think you should bow down so low

1488
01:30:27,337 --> 01:30:29,753
that you don't have to get up.

1489
01:30:38,878 --> 01:30:41,212
Sweet little sixteen.

1490
01:30:41,837 --> 01:30:44,378
Whoa Max. you are good!

1491
01:30:44,753 --> 01:30:46,837
Now you look beau Ah, I'll kill you!

1492
01:30:46,920 --> 01:30:47,753
You look beautiful

1493
01:30:47,837 --> 01:30:51,253
but still no running, jumping,
picking up anything heavy.

1494
01:30:51,337 --> 01:30:52,670
All right?

1495
01:30:52,753 --> 01:30:55,253
And you're going to stay here

1496
01:30:55,337 --> 01:30:57,337
and stay away from you know who.

1497
01:30:57,420 --> 01:30:58,878
And she's going to school.

1498
01:30:58,962 --> 01:31:00,628
You heard the lady, and she's going to school

1499
01:31:00,712 --> 01:31:02,462
Shake the head yes.

1500
01:31:02,545 --> 01:31:03,212
Good, you understand?

1501
01:31:03,295 --> 01:31:06,003
Say yes.
Yes.

1502
01:31:06,087 --> 01:31:07,753
Okay.

1503
01:31:08,378 --> 01:31:09,628
Be careful.

1504
01:31:09,712 --> 01:31:11,212
Goodbye.

1505
01:31:11,295 --> 01:31:13,545
Thank you.

1506
01:31:16,045 --> 01:31:17,128
I'm serious.

1507
01:31:40,503 --> 01:31:41,712
Hah, busted!

1508
01:31:45,087 --> 01:31:49,253
Well rickshaw wallahs,
eat your heart out, Hasari, looking great.

1509
01:31:49,337 --> 01:31:50,587
Shambu, go and shut that door.

1510
01:31:50,670 --> 01:31:51,837
Okay, babu.

1511
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:52,753
I'll get it.

1512
01:31:52,837 --> 01:31:55,087
Godfather has more eyes than a pineapple.

1513
01:31:55,170 --> 01:31:56,670
Manooj, bring that stool.

1514
01:31:56,753 --> 01:31:58,128
Yes, babu.

1515
01:31:59,670 --> 01:32:00,962
Hurry UP-

1516
01:32:02,837 --> 01:32:06,003
Let me help you.

1517
01:32:06,087 --> 01:32:07,545
Please let me do it!

1518
01:32:07,628 --> 01:32:08,837
Sorry.

1519
01:32:16,212 --> 01:32:17,170
Push that log in

1520
01:32:21,212 --> 01:32:22,045
Hasari

1521
01:32:22,128 --> 01:32:23,795
I.u
m

1522
01:32:23,878 --> 01:32:26,462
promised the kids I'd take them
to the cinema to the

1523
01:32:26,545 --> 01:32:27,962
new Anil Kapur movie.

1524
01:32:28,045 --> 01:32:30,170
Well, if a man promises something.

1525
01:32:33,545 --> 01:32:35,795
Baba

1526
01:32:35,878 --> 01:32:37,628
baba, are you okay?

1527
01:32:37,712 --> 01:32:39,795
Baba

1528
01:32:39,878 --> 01:32:42,295
It's all right.

1529
01:32:42,378 --> 01:32:44,545
Go back to your work.

1530
01:32:44,628 --> 01:32:45,420
Yes, baba.

1531
01:32:47,962 --> 01:32:48,962
Can I see that, please?

1532
01:32:49,045 --> 01:32:49,795
It's nothing, it's

1533
01:32:49,878 --> 01:32:50,545
Open your hand.

1534
01:32:50,628 --> 01:32:51,045
Just cough.

1535
01:32:51,128 --> 01:32:53,253
If it's nothing, open your hand.

1536
01:32:57,878 --> 01:33:00,253
You're not taking the medication, are you?

1537
01:33:06,128 --> 01:33:07,295
Hasari

1538
01:33:07,378 --> 01:33:10,753
not everything I do is wrong. I am a doctor.

1539
01:33:12,378 --> 01:33:17,337
Tuberculosis is something to be messed with.
Do you understand it can kill you?

1540
01:33:17,878 --> 01:33:19,003
Do you?

1541
01:33:21,462 --> 01:33:23,212
HEY

1542
01:33:23,295 --> 01:33:24,837
you know best, right?

1543
01:33:30,420 --> 01:33:31,295
You got one hour, kids.

1544
01:33:45,337 --> 01:33:48,128
Max daddah, Anil Kapur is the best fighter in
the world.

1545
01:33:48,212 --> 01:33:49,712
What are you talking about, better than Rambo

1546
01:33:49,795 --> 01:33:51,128
Yes, better than Rambo.

1547
01:33:51,212 --> 01:33:52,295
You're crazy.

1548
01:33:52,378 --> 01:33:53,712
He's much better than Rambo.

1549
01:33:53,795 --> 01:33:58,212
It's Captain Manooj Pal, the pirate doctor.

1550
01:33:58,295 --> 01:34:00,878
You are so fun, magic Max,
I wish my father was so fun as you.

1551
01:34:00,962 --> 01:34:03,378
Whoa, whoa!

1552
01:34:03,462 --> 01:34:04,962
Don't you ever say that.

1553
01:34:05,045 --> 01:34:09,128
I wish my daddy had loved me half
as much as your daddy loves you.

1554
01:34:09,212 --> 01:34:11,128
He's a very' special man,
do you understand that?

1555
01:34:11,212 --> 01:34:12,378
- Yes
- Yeah?

1556
01:34:12,462 --> 01:34:13,212
Okay,

1557
01:34:13,295 --> 01:34:16,045
And he's backing me up.

1558
01:34:17,253 --> 01:34:18,295
Oh no, he's in trouble.

1559
01:34:21,087 --> 01:34:22,045
Okay, everybody off the road.

1560
01:34:22,753 --> 01:34:23,462
Out of the way.

1561
01:34:28,170 --> 01:34:29,462
Max daddah!

1562
01:34:29,753 --> 01:34:31,212
Run, run, move it!

1563
01:34:34,337 --> 01:34:35,045
Shambu!

1564
01:34:51,462 --> 01:34:53,712
He'll be okay, it's just

1565
01:34:53,795 --> 01:34:55,878
just a little bruise, a little scared.

1566
01:35:03,753 --> 01:35:04,628
When he wakes up.

1567
01:35:15,045 --> 01:35:15,670
Goodnight.

1568
01:35:26,628 --> 01:35:28,003
Isn't it a work of art?

1569
01:35:28,378 --> 01:35:30,837
This is Arjun's chariot.

1570
01:35:31,295 --> 01:35:33,462
Pity it won't be used, though.

1571
01:35:33,545 --> 01:35:34,795
What?

1572
01:35:34,878 --> 01:35:37,003
Will they let you use it?

1573
01:35:38,295 --> 01:35:40,753
I'm going to talk to the old man.

1574
01:35:41,212 --> 01:35:42,545
Listen to him.

1575
01:35:42,628 --> 01:35:44,378
I'll catch him when he's alone.

1576
01:35:44,462 --> 01:35:46,295
He's not like his son.

1577
01:35:46,378 --> 01:35:48,753
He came to the city with a little bundle.

1578
01:35:55,462 --> 01:35:57,628
Hasari

1579
01:35:57,712 --> 01:35:59,295
don't

1580
01:35:59,378 --> 01:36:01,878
They could have killed
my little son yesterday.

1581
01:36:01,962 --> 01:36:02,628
Yes.

1582
01:36:02,712 --> 01:36:04,212
- Max, it's not the point.
- But Hasari

1583
01:36:04,295 --> 01:36:07,295
- He's doing this to frighten all of us.
-If you'd be the next tomorrow?

1584
01:36:07,378 --> 01:36:09,212
- Max has nothing to do with it.
- What would happen to your family?

1585
01:36:09,295 --> 01:36:11,462
And in fact godfather has
nothing to do with this.

1586
01:36:11,545 --> 01:36:12,420
It's his son.

1587
01:36:33,545 --> 01:36:34,378
Chomotkar da.

1588
01:36:34,462 --> 01:36:35,587
What's happening?

1589
01:36:36,712 --> 01:36:38,545
The godfather is dying.

1590
01:36:38,628 --> 01:36:40,587
And the son is raising rent.

1591
01:36:41,795 --> 01:36:42,837
Ram da, take care of this.

1592
01:36:44,045 --> 01:36:45,045
Don't involve yourself.

1593
01:36:45,128 --> 01:36:46,295
But they are our own people

1594
01:36:46,378 --> 01:36:47,545
If the old man is dying we

1595
01:36:47,628 --> 01:36:50,295
Rickshaw work, Zindahad

1596
01:36:50,378 --> 01:36:55,587
Rickshaw union, Zindahad.

1597
01:37:04,962 --> 01:37:06,462
My father is ill!

1598
01:37:06,545 --> 01:37:09,128
Your godfather is dying!

1599
01:37:09,212 --> 01:37:11,045
This is how you show your respect.

1600
01:37:11,128 --> 01:37:13,795
Do you think I want to raise the rent?

1601
01:37:13,878 --> 01:37:14,962
Huh?

1602
01:37:15,045 --> 01:37:17,878
Do you know how much it costs to
change a spoke on a wheel?

1603
01:37:17,962 --> 01:37:21,712
Do you realise how much money I have
to spend to keep you people on the road?

1604
01:37:21,795 --> 01:37:22,628
First

1605
01:37:22,712 --> 01:37:24,462
you all know this man.

1606
01:37:24,545 --> 01:37:27,128
He is only a son.

1607
01:37:27,212 --> 01:37:29,462
Godfather was a different man.

1608
01:37:29,545 --> 01:37:32,545
You can't risk your lives with this man.

1609
01:37:32,628 --> 01:37:35,837
I propose end of lets pay

1610
01:37:37,878 --> 01:37:40,128
Rickshaw union, Zindahad.

1611
01:37:40,212 --> 01:37:42,462
So you want to strike?

1612
01:37:42,545 --> 01:37:43,628
Strike!

1613
01:37:43,712 --> 01:37:46,795
Those of you who want to strike leave
your rickshaws here.

1614
01:37:46,878 --> 01:37:48,378
Those of you who want to work

1615
01:37:48,462 --> 01:37:51,003
there are customers out there, get out

1616
01:37:53,212 --> 01:37:54,295
I-I6)'

1617
01:37:54,378 --> 01:37:55,212
he)'

1618
01:37:55,295 --> 01:37:56,212
where are you going?

1619
01:37:56,295 --> 01:37:58,003
Don't don't go!

1620
01:38:03,962 --> 01:38:08,837
They tried to kill my son.

1621
01:38:35,378 --> 01:38:37,378
Nobody thinks about us rickshaw pullers

1622
01:38:37,462 --> 01:38:39,587
or bothers with our stories.

1623
01:38:39,962 --> 01:38:42,128
They trust us to take their
children to school

1624
01:38:42,212 --> 01:38:45,878
but they forget the boiling tar on the
road which blisters our feet.

1625
01:38:45,962 --> 01:38:47,795
Cars trying to run us down.

1626
01:38:47,878 --> 01:38:50,378
We are threatened by corrupt police,
we pay off officials

1627
01:38:50,462 --> 01:38:52,295
we pay off Goondas.

1628
01:38:52,378 --> 01:38:55,462
I'm proud to take my countrymen
from place to place

1629
01:38:55,545 --> 01:38:57,670
but I can't keep silent any longer.

1630
01:38:59,378 --> 01:39:00,462
As someone said,

1631
01:39:00,545 --> 01:39:02,545
if a man bows down too many times.

1632
01:39:02,628 --> 01:39:05,837
There will come a time when he won't be
able to stand up forever!

1633
01:39:08,462 --> 01:39:09,920
Silence!

1634
01:39:10,378 --> 01:39:12,295
There will be no commotion.

1635
01:39:12,378 --> 01:39:16,212
I will make a restraining order against
Ashoka Ghatak.

1636
01:39:16,295 --> 01:39:18,712
This man will be permitted
to use his rickshaw

1637
01:39:18,795 --> 01:39:21,253
without let or hindrance.

1638
01:39:23,128 --> 01:39:26,503
These men have clear
and legal right to strike.

1639
01:39:28,378 --> 01:39:30,962
I haven't finished these proceedings.

1640
01:39:31,045 --> 01:39:36,337
For his part in this disturbance I fine
the defendant fifty rupees.

1641
01:39:36,712 --> 01:39:37,878
But ma'am

1642
01:39:37,962 --> 01:39:38,878
Pay at this time

1643
01:39:38,962 --> 01:39:40,795
or spend seven days in jail.

1644
01:39:40,878 --> 01:39:42,712
But madam, I, I can't afford fifty

1645
01:39:42,795 --> 01:39:44,045
Next.

1646
01:39:44,128 --> 01:39:46,128
Madam, fifty rupees is

1647
01:39:46,212 --> 01:39:48,837
I have not done anything wrong.

1648
01:40:24,378 --> 01:40:26,337
MOFISOOH, monsoon

1649
01:41:44,045 --> 01:41:45,962
What does your father do?

1650
01:41:46,045 --> 01:41:47,837
He owns the workshop.

1651
01:41:48,212 --> 01:41:49,545
Are you studying?

1652
01:41:49,628 --> 01:41:51,378
I just finished my school.

1653
01:41:51,462 --> 01:41:53,170
So I must visit your father.

1654
01:42:45,128 --> 01:42:46,170
Go home, doctor.

1655
01:43:34,670 --> 01:43:35,462
Junior!

1656
01:43:36,087 --> 01:43:37,087
What's wrong?

1657
01:43:37,170 --> 01:43:39,295
Ashoka ordered me to go home.

1658
01:43:40,253 --> 01:43:41,712
So here I am.

1659
01:44:01,170 --> 01:44:02,253
Oh, who's that?

1660
01:44:02,337 --> 01:44:03,545
Who's the little girl?

1661
01:44:04,253 --> 01:44:05,962
Patient.

1662
01:44:08,170 --> 01:44:09,045
She died.

1663
01:44:09,337 --> 01:44:10,545
I couldn't save her.

1664
01:44:11,587 --> 01:44:13,128
Proverbial last straw.

1665
01:44:18,503 --> 01:44:20,628
You know.

1666
01:44:25,503 --> 01:44:28,253
There was a man in the town when I grew up.

1667
01:44:28,337 --> 01:44:32,503
Thirteen years his wife was dead and he still
laid a place for her at

1668
01:44:32,587 --> 01:44:35,003
One day he burned his house to the
ground.

1669
01:44:35,087 --> 01:44:36,878
And he left the town for good.

1670
01:44:37,337 --> 01:44:39,212
We assumed he was a free man.

1671
01:44:49,753 --> 01:44:51,253
Welcome home, junior.

1672
01:44:51,337 --> 01:44:52,795
Thanks.

1673
01:44:55,337 --> 01:44:56,670
Hey goodnight.

1674
01:44:56,753 --> 01:44:58,628
Goodnight.

1675
01:45:01,253 --> 01:45:03,962
So, you want your daughter to marry my son.

1676
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:06,837
You're a rickshaw puller.

1677
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:08,087
Am I correct?

1678
01:45:08,170 --> 01:45:09,587
Yes, sir.

1679
01:45:09,670 --> 01:45:11,337
But I own my rickshaw

1680
01:45:11,420 --> 01:45:12,837
He is the owner of his rickshaw.

1681
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:16,462
I'm a partner of the workshop where
your daughter is employed.

1682
01:45:17,503 --> 01:45:19,003
Are you aware of that?

1683
01:45:19,087 --> 01:45:21,087
Yes, my daughter had told me that.

1684
01:45:21,170 --> 01:45:25,920
So tell me how could I permit my
son to marry your daughter, huh?

1685
01:45:26,003 --> 01:45:27,003
Just a moment, please.

1686
01:45:27,087 --> 01:45:29,753
Ah, he's an oldfashioned man
Don't worry, huh?

1687
01:45:29,837 --> 01:45:32,170
Um, brother are you saying that, er

1688
01:45:32,253 --> 01:45:36,170
in no way you can consider
this marriage, huh?

1689
01:45:36,253 --> 01:45:37,337
It is a love match, you see.

1690
01:45:37,420 --> 01:45:40,087
Perhaps some inducement
would that help you anyway.

1691
01:45:40,170 --> 01:45:42,003
- Inducement?
- Yeah.

1692
01:45:42,087 --> 01:45:43,587
What could he possibly offer?

1693
01:45:43,670 --> 01:45:44,837
Possibly nothing.

1694
01:45:44,920 --> 01:45:47,337
But in fairness we should find out, huh?

1695
01:45:58,878 --> 01:45:59,670
<i>D-BY</i>

1696
01:46:00,878 --> 01:46:03,378
Hey Ram daddah how is the business?

1697
01:46:03,462 --> 01:46:04,628
Hey, Hasari!

1698
01:46:04,712 --> 01:46:05,545
Good business.

1699
01:46:14,378 --> 01:46:17,170
Are you feeling better today?

1700
01:46:17,545 --> 01:46:18,837
Doctor Max magic.

1701
01:46:20,045 --> 01:46:26,628
Isn't it a joy to watch this disaster?
We shall by grace of God make fortunes today.

1702
01:46:26,712 --> 01:46:27,545
Eight rupees.

1703
01:46:27,628 --> 01:46:29,128
It's too much, the rate is fixed.

1704
01:46:29,212 --> 01:46:31,212
Who needs a ride?

1705
01:46:31,295 --> 01:46:32,212
Come on, come on.

1706
01:46:32,295 --> 01:46:33,753
And two rupees for the packet.

1707
01:46:54,962 --> 01:46:55,378
Change.

1708
01:46:55,462 --> 01:46:56,128
No change.

1709
01:46:56,212 --> 01:46:56,962
Change!

1710
01:46:57,045 --> 01:46:58,420
Daylight robbery!

1711
01:46:59,128 --> 01:47:01,087
Come back, come back!

1712
01:47:01,712 --> 01:47:03,878
God bless Kali, he has heard your prayer.

1713
01:47:03,962 --> 01:47:04,795
Yes.

1714
01:47:04,878 --> 01:47:06,295
If it keeps on like this.

1715
01:47:06,378 --> 01:47:10,420
You'll make Amrita's dowry and
I will return to my village.

1716
01:47:10,878 --> 01:47:11,920
God willing.

1717
01:47:19,128 --> 01:47:20,170
What can he possibly offer?

1718
01:47:21,462 --> 01:47:22,503
Hey, babu!

1719
01:48:16,212 --> 01:48:17,670
Oh no, no, no

1720
01:48:19,712 --> 01:48:21,378
Well I know why I stayed.

1721
01:48:21,462 --> 01:48:23,587
You can get water front property cheap.

1722
01:48:27,628 --> 01:48:34,212
They're coming from the clinic,
they're coming!

1723
01:48:34,295 --> 01:48:36,295
- Hang on, they're coming.
- Oh look look who's coming.

1724
01:48:36,378 --> 01:48:37,712
Max daddah.

1725
01:48:37,795 --> 01:48:39,295
Thank God he's coming.

1726
01:48:39,378 --> 01:48:42,253
Come on, come on, quick,
the whole thing is getting lost.

1727
01:48:42,545 --> 01:48:43,378
Come on!

1728
01:48:43,462 --> 01:48:45,628
- Get the stuff down to the water!
- Where are they?

1729
01:48:45,712 --> 01:48:47,128
- Here!
- Ah, there they are.

1730
01:48:47,212 --> 01:48:48,795
- Anouar!
- Max!

1731
01:48:48,878 --> 01:48:49,753
Let's get out there!

1732
01:48:50,878 --> 01:48:52,170
Max

1733
01:48:53,212 --> 01:48:54,337
Throw it down!

1734
01:48:54,712 --> 01:48:56,212
Take out the tyres.

1735
01:48:56,295 --> 01:48:58,712
Come on, come on.

1736
01:48:58,795 --> 01:49:00,753
Throw it down!

1737
01:49:01,295 --> 01:49:02,128
Anouar, don't worry.

1738
01:49:02,212 --> 01:49:03,670
Okay, let's get the raft together.

1739
01:49:14,128 --> 01:49:16,462
Max!

1740
01:49:16,545 --> 01:49:19,462
- Max, please take the baby
- Come on, give me the baby.

1741
01:49:19,545 --> 01:49:21,795
- Please help her, Max.
- Come on.

1742
01:49:21,878 --> 01:49:25,670
- Take the baby.
- I got him, I got him.

1743
01:50:55,503 --> 01:50:56,295
Max daddah.

1744
01:50:59,087 --> 01:51:00,628
Max daddah.

1745
01:51:02,503 --> 01:51:03,462
Max daddah.

1746
01:51:30,503 --> 01:51:31,212
Thanks.

1747
01:51:33,170 --> 01:51:34,128
You're cold.

1748
01:51:42,253 --> 01:51:44,462
He's in bed when he
should be working.

1749
01:51:56,420 --> 01:51:58,628
You dring this and
it'll warm you up.

1750
01:52:01,337 --> 01:52:02,295
Sorry, it's a bit full.

1751
01:52:19,253 --> 01:52:20,045
You know, er...

1752
01:52:23,253 --> 01:52:25,045
...that time at the godfather's
when you, er...

1753
01:52:26,670 --> 01:52:29,045
wanted to know about the candy
and the bribes.

1754
01:52:32,587 --> 01:52:33,712
When I was a kid, er...

1755
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:37,795
...I walked in on my father
with another woman.

1756
01:52:40,087 --> 01:52:41,378
That's when the bribes started.

1757
01:52:43,920 --> 01:52:45,462
He'd tell my mum
we were gonna go play golf.

1758
01:52:47,253 --> 01:52:50,295
I loved driving that
golf cart for him and...

1759
01:52:50,837 --> 01:52:52,087
...and, re...

1760
01:52:52,170 --> 01:52:54,795
...just being with him, you know.

1761
01:52:55,253 --> 01:52:58,503
Then we stopped going
to the golf course and...

1762
01:52:58,587 --> 01:52:59,753
...and, er...

1763
01:52:59,837 --> 01:53:01,628
...we'd go see her instead.

1764
01:53:02,253 --> 01:53:03,837
He kept a stock of candy bars
in the glove compartment.

1765
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:05,628
He said don't tell, don't tell mum.

1766
01:53:06,253 --> 01:53:07,962
This is just between us men, Okey?

1767
01:53:09,503 --> 01:53:11,212
I'd sit at the dinner table...

1768
01:53:12,420 --> 01:53:13,712
...and I couldn't even look at my mother.

1769
01:53:15,670 --> 01:53:18,378
After a while I couldn't even eat
the candy bars. I just stuck'em in a drawer

1770
01:53:20,670 --> 01:53:22,253
So at nine I was...

1771
01:53:22,337 --> 01:53:23,795
...an alibi and a traitor.

1772
01:53:26,837 --> 01:53:28,212
At twelve...

1773
01:53:30,420 --> 01:53:32,628
...she died and --
and I never told her.

1774
01:53:36,253 --> 01:53:38,545
After that, you know,
I, I just shut down.

1775
01:53:41,420 --> 01:53:43,128
You, you shut the vvorkd out maybe.

1776
01:53:44,587 --> 01:53:47,378
I, I worshipped the ground
that man walked on.

1777
01:53:50,503 --> 01:53:52,045
Lonely, lonely Max.

1778
01:53:53,337 --> 01:53:54,712
Lonely Joan.

1779
01:53:56,753 --> 01:53:58,045
Sometime.

1780
01:53:59,003 --> 01:54:01,503
You know what this is?

1781
01:54:01,587 --> 01:54:04,462
It's the world's smallest record player
playing "My Heart Bleeds For You."

1782
01:54:27,920 --> 01:54:31,587
Why don't you sell
him some ornaments of gold...

1783
01:54:31,670 --> 01:54:34,295
Please, let me speak.

1784
01:54:34,837 --> 01:54:36,170
How much gold do you have?

1785
01:54:36,253 --> 01:54:39,295
Please don't embarrass me, sir,
I have no gold.

1786
01:54:39,587 --> 01:54:41,920
The only ornament
I have is my daughter.

1787
01:54:42,003 --> 01:54:44,003
She's a good girl
and she's a working girl.

1788
01:54:44,087 --> 01:54:48,462
She has been a jewel of my house.
Now she'll be a jewel of your house.

1789
01:54:51,170 --> 01:54:51,837
Are they still at it?

1790
01:54:51,920 --> 01:54:53,378
It's only the beginning.

1791
01:54:53,670 --> 01:54:54,337
I'll see you.

1792
01:54:54,420 --> 01:54:55,420
Okay.

1793
01:54:55,503 --> 01:54:56,337
Hello, Doctor Max.

1794
01:54:56,420 --> 01:54:57,545
Hi, you guys.

1795
01:54:58,170 --> 01:54:59,170
So Ram, how's it going?

1796
01:54:59,253 --> 01:55:00,420
They 're very upset.

1797
01:55:00,503 --> 01:55:03,628
They're saying that Hasari has sent
his daughter to trap their son.

1798
01:55:03,712 --> 01:55:05,212
- Trap their son?
- Hello, Mr.Max.

1799
01:55:05,295 --> 01:55:08,128
All that really separates
them is an ounce of gold.

1800
01:55:08,212 --> 01:55:09,462
That's all, an ounce of gold?

1801
01:55:09,545 --> 01:55:10,962
How much is that?

1802
01:55:11,045 --> 01:55:12,003
About this much.

1803
01:55:12,378 --> 01:55:13,795
See that?

1804
01:55:13,878 --> 01:55:15,378
So is your daddy tearing 'em up?

1805
01:55:15,462 --> 01:55:18,128
Oh yes. my daddy is better than Rambo.

1806
01:55:18,212 --> 01:55:20,795
Rambo -- what happened to
Anil Kapur, huh?

1807
01:55:25,253 --> 01:55:26,462
Have you some cash?

1808
01:55:36,670 --> 01:55:37,670
What is it?

1809
01:55:37,753 --> 01:55:38,670
What's happening?!

1810
01:55:38,753 --> 01:55:39,837
Listen!

1811
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:41,295
Listen, this is my rickshaw!

1812
01:55:43,170 --> 01:55:45,753
Babu -- babu, what is this?

1813
01:55:45,837 --> 01:55:48,087
Thank you for dropping by.

1814
01:55:48,170 --> 01:55:50,337
My father is dead.

1815
01:55:50,420 --> 01:55:52,337
So now I'm in charge.

1816
01:55:52,420 --> 01:55:54,337
Is this your rickshaw?

1817
01:55:54,420 --> 01:55:55,587
Yes.

1818
01:55:55,670 --> 01:55:56,503
You made this?

1819
01:55:56,587 --> 01:55:57,753
Yes, babu.

1820
01:55:57,837 --> 01:55:59,545
That's beautiful.

1821
01:56:03,003 --> 01:56:04,212
Blue!

1822
01:56:05,170 --> 01:56:06,462
Beautiful.

1823
01:56:10,753 --> 01:56:12,670
Ashoda, please don't do this.

1824
01:56:12,753 --> 01:56:14,545
I'll do whatever I like.

1825
01:56:15,337 --> 01:56:16,712
I'm in charge.

1826
01:56:18,837 --> 01:56:20,128
You will get off my street.

1827
01:56:20,503 --> 01:56:21,753
You will leave my country.

1828
01:56:21,837 --> 01:56:24,170
And the clinic
and school --closed.

1829
01:56:24,253 --> 01:56:25,920
Why, we're not doing you any harm.

1830
01:56:26,003 --> 01:56:30,628
Because I hate interfering foreigners
who think they are better than me.

1831
01:56:30,837 --> 01:56:32,420
But you hurt your own people

1832
01:56:32,503 --> 01:56:35,545
Exactly -- my P9OPle-

1833
01:56:39,503 --> 01:56:40,628
Loyal.

1834
01:56:43,670 --> 01:56:44,628
No!

1835
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:52,378
She's beautiful.

1836
01:56:53,087 --> 01:56:54,212
Beautiful.

1837
01:57:00,587 --> 01:57:04,212
Some day she is going to give
somebody a lot of joy.

1838
01:57:04,503 --> 01:57:06,420
Leave my child alone!

1839
01:57:06,503 --> 01:57:07,753
What did he say?

1840
01:57:07,837 --> 01:57:09,503
He said don't touch her.

1841
01:57:09,587 --> 01:57:10,503
Now, doctor...

1842
01:57:10,587 --> 01:57:14,337
...what concern is it of
yours -- who I touch?

1843
01:57:14,420 --> 01:57:16,337
They're my family.

1844
01:57:16,420 --> 01:57:18,420
Your family.

1845
01:57:18,503 --> 01:57:20,462
My people

1846
01:57:25,587 --> 01:57:26,795
Babu!

1847
01:57:28,087 --> 01:57:29,045
No!

1848
01:57:44,003 --> 01:57:47,295
You put your dirty hands on my child!

1849
01:57:49,253 --> 01:57:50,587
Salim.

1850
01:57:50,670 --> 01:57:52,253
No, Salim

1851
01:57:52,337 --> 01:57:54,170
I want you to stop!

1852
01:57:54,253 --> 01:57:56,170
Let him settle this himself.

1853
01:57:56,253 --> 01:57:57,295
Salim!

1854
01:58:04,920 --> 01:58:05,670
I won't leave here!

1855
01:58:05,753 --> 01:58:06,587
Baba!

1856
01:58:06,670 --> 01:58:08,503
Baba!

1857
01:58:08,587 --> 01:58:12,670
No baba, don't.

1858
01:58:12,753 --> 01:58:16,087
No baba!

1859
01:58:37,503 --> 01:58:39,503
No more!

1860
01:58:39,587 --> 01:58:43,295
No more feet on our necks, babu!

1861
01:58:44,087 --> 01:58:45,837
Come on.

1862
01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:47,295
We've taught him a good lesson.

1863
01:59:00,337 --> 01:59:01,462
Max daddah.

1864
01:59:06,503 --> 01:59:09,837
Sit down, sit down. sit down.

1865
01:59:09,920 --> 01:59:12,878
Pressure, push, push.

1866
01:59:28,837 --> 01:59:29,920
I think I'll give him a break.

1867
01:59:30,003 --> 01:59:31,462
Well you can try but he won't leave him.

1868
01:59:33,920 --> 01:59:35,003
Shall I stay?

1869
01:59:35,087 --> 01:59:36,837
No, I thing you should go home.
I'll look after him.

1870
01:59:36,920 --> 01:59:38,337
It's okay, I can stay.

1871
01:59:38,420 --> 01:59:40,295
No, you've got an early day tomorrow.

1872
01:59:41,087 --> 01:59:42,212
Okay.

1873
01:59:42,837 --> 01:59:44,170
We make a good team.

1874
01:59:44,253 --> 01:59:45,878
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

1875
02:00:00,337 --> 02:00:01,545
You see that picture up there?

1876
02:00:02,337 --> 02:00:04,295
The guys on the front looking
off into the distance.

1877
02:00:05,837 --> 02:00:07,420
Like you and your baba...

1878
02:00:07,503 --> 02:00:08,628
...their full of hope.

1879
02:00:09,587 --> 02:00:13,878
You see that guy on the back of the
raft with his ohih on his hand...

1880
02:00:14,503 --> 02:00:15,753
Huh?

1881
02:00:15,837 --> 02:00:17,753
...like old magic Max...

1882
02:00:17,837 --> 02:00:20,295
...he spends all his time being afraid.

1883
02:00:20,378 --> 02:00:22,670
Scared of all the bad
things that could happen.

1884
02:00:23,045 --> 02:00:24,545
But the guys on the front...

1885
02:00:24,628 --> 02:00:27,045
...somehow they stay full of hope.

1886
02:00:27,128 --> 02:00:30,378
And they never ever, ever give up.

1887
02:00:30,462 --> 02:00:31,545
Right?

1888
02:00:31,628 --> 02:00:32,712
And you know what?

1889
02:00:32,795 --> 02:00:36,045
What makes it possible to make
it through all the rough stuff...

1890
02:00:36,128 --> 02:00:38,545
...is our love for each other.

1891
02:00:38,628 --> 02:00:40,087
Huh?

1892
02:00:42,878 --> 02:00:44,337
Baba...

1893
02:00:45,378 --> 02:00:46,337
...baba!

1894
02:00:56,003 --> 02:00:56,962
Oh, Max daddah.

1895
02:01:00,837 --> 02:01:03,045
For a long time I wanted you to leave.

1896
02:01:04,920 --> 02:01:07,795
You made me feel things
I never felt before.

1897
02:01:09,170 --> 02:01:10,712
I'm glad you came to my country.

1898
02:01:12,003 --> 02:01:15,295
I'll ask the God's to bless each
day of your absence.

1899
02:01:22,587 --> 02:01:23,378
What's that?

1900
02:01:26,670 --> 02:01:27,878
I'm dreaming now?

1901
02:01:31,003 --> 02:01:31,753
Baba!

1902
02:01:31,837 --> 02:01:32,962
Must look.

1903
02:01:34,837 --> 02:01:36,420
Easy, easy. easy...

1904
02:01:36,503 --> 02:01:38,462
That's it, real slow real slow.

1905
02:01:51,837 --> 02:01:53,295
When I came to this city I had no-one.

1906
02:01:55,587 --> 02:01:58,795
Well my friend - it was you who got
Ashoka off their backs.

1907
02:02:05,587 --> 02:02:06,795
No, no, no, lay down.

1908
02:02:08,670 --> 02:02:12,212
The journey isn't what you expect.
Don't be surprised.

1909
02:02:13,003 --> 02:02:15,337
My father said that...

1910
02:02:15,420 --> 02:02:17,212
...before I left the village.

1911
02:02:17,753 --> 02:02:22,712
Get his pills.

1912
02:02:22,795 --> 02:02:23,545
What?

1913
02:02:23,628 --> 02:02:25,670
Is my father going to be dead?

1914
02:02:27,128 --> 02:02:28,920
Get serious.

1915
02:02:29,295 --> 02:02:30,670
Your father's gonna be fine.

1916
02:02:32,878 --> 02:02:34,795
Does he need gold?

1917
02:02:34,878 --> 02:02:37,337
Yeah, he needs gold.

1918
02:02:41,962 --> 02:02:43,920
Is this a gold?

1919
02:02:48,462 --> 02:02:49,587
Yeah, that's gold.

1920
02:02:51,628 --> 02:02:54,087
Now my sister can get married?

1921
02:02:55,628 --> 02:02:59,545
Yeah -- yeah, now your sister
can get married.

1922
02:02:59,628 --> 02:03:01,003
All because of you.

1923
02:03:27,295 --> 02:03:28,753
You should be resting.

1924
02:03:41,878 --> 02:03:43,170
God bless you, my child.

1925
02:03:45,378 --> 02:03:46,253
Sit.

1926
02:03:54,378 --> 02:03:57,253
See -- this grew out of a tiny seed.

1927
02:04:04,462 --> 02:04:05,920
You never did belong to me.

1928
02:04:07,545 --> 02:04:09,253
You were only lent to me by God.

1929
02:04:10,295 --> 02:04:11,503
Until you marry.

1930
02:04:12,962 --> 02:04:14,545
And continue the wheel of life.

1931
02:05:17,253 --> 02:05:19,545
But you don't like the city --no.

1932
02:05:26,378 --> 02:05:28,295
Chomotkar daddah.

1933
02:05:28,378 --> 02:05:29,545
Are you okay?

1934
02:05:29,628 --> 02:05:33,045
Yeah, I'm, I'm fine.

1935
02:05:33,128 --> 02:05:35,587
I would be honoured if you'd come
and sit next to my father.

1936
02:05:35,962 --> 02:05:37,087
To bless the daughter.

1937
02:06:04,378 --> 02:06:05,128
What are they doing?

1938
02:06:05,212 --> 02:06:07,753
You have to pour the water in the hand.

1939
02:06:08,295 --> 02:06:10,253
That's how the marriage is solemnised.

1940
02:06:44,295 --> 02:06:45,587
Well now, junior.

1941
02:06:48,295 --> 02:06:52,503
I bet you never thought you'd be giving
away a daughter in a Calcutta slum.

1942
02:06:52,878 --> 02:06:57,045
Well now, Sister Joan...

1943
02:06:57,128 --> 02:07:01,795
I bet you never
expected me to say

1944
02:07:01,878 --> 02:07:03,337
that I'm glad to be here.

1945
02:07:07,128 --> 02:07:09,087
I never felt more alive.

1946
02:07:13,378 --> 02:07:15,087
So...

1947
02:07:16,628 --> 02:07:17,920
...now you're free to go.

1948
02:07:18,712 --> 02:07:21,087
No -- now I'm free to stay.

1949
02:07:23,545 --> 02:07:26,753
Well now, I just might be able to find
something for you to do.

1950
02:07:27,212 --> 02:07:28,795
I'm, I'm not promising mind because...

1951
02:07:28,878 --> 02:07:33,378
I've a beautiful Frenchman coming in
next week and I'm very partial to Frenchmen.

1952
02:07:37,378 --> 02:07:38,420
I'm glad you stuck it out.

1953
02:07:41,878 --> 02:07:42,837
Max daddah.

1954
02:07:43,295 --> 02:07:47,003
Max daddah.

1955
02:07:47,087 --> 02:07:49,753
See that group of people,
if they need anything...

1956
02:07:49,837 --> 02:07:51,128
just see, I'll be there.

1957
02:07:51,670 --> 02:07:52,087
Go.

1958
02:07:52,170 --> 02:07:56,712
Look, your daughter, it's her first night.
You can't --

1959
02:07:57,087 --> 02:07:58,670
Oh Jesus!

1960
02:07:58,753 --> 02:08:00,503
Please, please...

1961
02:08:00,587 --> 02:08:03,045
...this is the time of their happiness.

1962
02:08:03,503 --> 02:08:06,337
Please.

1963
02:08:06,420 --> 02:08:07,462
Let's go.

1964
02:08:11,753 --> 02:08:13,045
No, he's had enough.

1965
02:08:16,337 --> 02:08:22,212
You should have had five more daughters.

1966
02:08:22,295 --> 02:08:23,920
Your son Manooj -- is a genius.

1967
02:08:24,295 --> 02:08:25,670
Okay, remind me that I'll tell you
what he told me.

1968
02:08:25,753 --> 02:08:26,795
Yeah.

1969
02:08:27,753 --> 02:08:29,378
Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on...

1970
02:08:55,337 --> 02:08:57,462
I want to walk on my own. Max daddah

1971
02:08:59,503 --> 02:09:00,378
Max da.

1972
02:09:06,587 --> 02:09:07,378
Is it bad?

1973
02:09:07,753 --> 02:09:09,003
Fatal, you mean?

1974
02:09:09,087 --> 02:09:12,628
No, it's not fatal, if I can keep
you in bed for more than five minutes.

1975
02:09:15,587 --> 02:09:16,878
You've done enough, Hasari.

1976
02:09:17,670 --> 02:09:19,295
Now you've got to get your strength back.

1977
02:09:22,087 --> 02:09:22,628
You know Max baddah...

1978
02:09:22,712 --> 02:09:23,712
What?

1979
02:09:23,795 --> 02:09:27,170
The Gods haven't made it
easy to be a human being.

1980
02:09:27,545 --> 02:09:29,670
They sure as hell haven't.

1981
02:09:30,128 --> 02:09:33,753
But I guess that's why it feels so
