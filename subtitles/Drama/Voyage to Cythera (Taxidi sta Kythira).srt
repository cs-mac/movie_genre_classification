1
00:02:01,684 --> 00:02:03,977
Ahoy, there! Look up!

2
00:02:09,482 --> 00:02:11,150
Fetch me a bow.

3
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:14,195
Look.

4
00:02:20,534 --> 00:02:23,036
Captain! Captain Sinbad!

5
00:02:23,161 --> 00:02:26,582
Up there in the sky.
It's holding something.

6
00:02:27,624 --> 00:02:29,000
Abdullah.

7
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:35,256
It shines like gold.

8
00:02:39,427 --> 00:02:41,387
Too strange to be an albatross.

9
00:02:41,512 --> 00:02:44,222
A jackdaw?
They steal bright things.

10
00:02:44,432 --> 00:02:47,017
No, too big for a jackdaw.

11
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,476
Omar!

12
00:02:52,564 --> 00:02:56,317
You fool!
You have brought bad luck on us all!

13
00:02:59,528 --> 00:03:00,571
Captain ...

14
00:03:02,573 --> 00:03:05,993
Cast it over the side. It is evil.

15
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,620
I feel it.

16
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:44,153
Captain!

17
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,254
For the love of Allah,
cast it overboard.

18
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,631
I think I'll keep it.

19
00:05:36,255 --> 00:05:38,966
{y:i}Sinbad!

20
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:42,386
{y:i}Sinbad!

21
00:05:46,973 --> 00:05:49,059
{y:i}Sinbad!

22
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:52,311
Sinbad!

23
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:06,699
- Captain!
- It's smashing us to pieces!

24
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,382
Can't hold her, Captain.
She's running before the wind. Look!

25
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,551
We're being driven on to the rocks.

26
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:29,429
Lash that sail!
Cut it adrift if you have to.

27
00:06:29,638 --> 00:06:31,097
Abdullah!

28
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:39,729
Allah give me strength!

29
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,593
{y:i}Sinbad!

30
00:07:13,636 --> 00:07:15,930
{y:i}Sinbad!

31
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,478
Marabia.

32
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,606
It must be Marabia.

33
00:08:11,813 --> 00:08:13,900
We are way off course.

34
00:08:15,151 --> 00:08:19,113
No. The dream I had, Rachid.
This it all part of it somehow.

35
00:08:19,322 --> 00:08:22,866
We have been brought here
by some mysterious force.

36
00:08:23,992 --> 00:08:25,661
Is it not written -

37
00:08:25,786 --> 00:08:29,956
- that a wise man will try to
realize his dream, to follow it?

38
00:08:30,164 --> 00:08:34,752
Some say that it is through dreams
that Allah speaks to mortal man.

39
00:08:34,961 --> 00:08:38,088
- To forsake the dream ...
- Is to forsake Him.

40
00:08:40,174 --> 00:08:44,010
Captain, he who walks on fire
will burn his feet.

41
00:08:51,225 --> 00:08:52,686
Captain?

42
00:08:53,728 --> 00:08:55,688
I'm going ashore.

43
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:01,110
- Aye. There's a good anchorage beyond.
- And that's where we'll meet.

44
00:09:15,622 --> 00:09:17,916
Do as he says!
We make for the anchorage!

45
00:09:53,866 --> 00:09:56,160
You are Captain Sinbad?

46
00:09:57,953 --> 00:09:59,705
I am.

47
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:07,754
You are also a thief.
And a thief is a king until he's caught.

48
00:10:08,171 --> 00:10:12,342
The bauble that hangs at your throat
is mine. Hand it to me.

49
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:15,260
Or you will have no throat.

50
00:10:18,805 --> 00:10:20,974
You'll be dead if you don't.

51
00:10:21,725 --> 00:10:24,645
You stole it from my courier.

52
00:10:27,147 --> 00:10:29,023
Very well.

53
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:29,705
It's Koura! The black prince!

54
00:12:14,745 --> 00:12:17,331
We have waited for you a long time.

55
00:12:22,878 --> 00:12:24,546
He escaped, Achmed.

56
00:12:24,755 --> 00:12:28,508
He rode into the city and escaped.
The Sultan's guards helped him.

57
00:12:28,717 --> 00:12:30,259
But you are all right?

58
00:12:30,384 --> 00:12:33,930
I brought the city gates down
upon their foolish faces.

59
00:12:35,681 --> 00:12:37,767
Master, your hand.

60
00:12:42,771 --> 00:12:47,566
We must hurry, Achmed. He who
searches for pearls should not sleep.

61
00:12:47,775 --> 00:12:53,531
Sinbad is even now with the vizier.
I must hear what passes between them.

62
00:12:53,739 --> 00:12:57,159
Walls have mice and mice have ears.

63
00:12:58,327 --> 00:13:00,411
And I have my spy.

64
00:13:01,455 --> 00:13:04,582
He has failed me once
but never twice.

65
00:13:29,814 --> 00:13:32,316
You tell a strange tale, Captain.

66
00:13:32,525 --> 00:13:36,487
Nevertheless, one fact
makes me believe your story.

67
00:13:37,321 --> 00:13:39,698
The amulet around your neck.

68
00:13:40,031 --> 00:13:43,159
It makes us allies
against the same enemy -

69
00:13:43,368 --> 00:13:45,871
- who covets it as much as l.

70
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:55,337
Fate, destiny have brought us together.
I would like to think so.

71
00:13:56,297 --> 00:13:57,339
Why?

72
00:13:58,882 --> 00:14:04,220
Our country is being choked by a great
evil visited upon us by Prince Koura.

73
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:06,097
Koura?

74
00:14:08,183 --> 00:14:10,059
The one who attacked me?

75
00:14:10,268 --> 00:14:12,853
A man versed in every black art -

76
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:17,149
- and dedicated to bringing
this domain under his power.

77
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,367
Please. I have an equally
strange tale to tell.

78
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:30,703
When our Sultan died without a son, -

79
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:34,540
- he made me, his grand vizier,
heir to two things.

80
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:38,418
The two being part of
one great, mighty secret.

81
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:41,546
What are these two things
you speak of?

82
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,632
You shall see.

83
00:15:36,888 --> 00:15:38,765
Here is the first.

84
00:15:42,644 --> 00:15:47,315
These pictures tell the story of
a legend as yet unrealised.

85
00:15:48,066 --> 00:15:52,112
Little remains, for even as our Sultan
breathed his last breath, -

86
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,781
- and I hastened here
to read the secrets, -

87
00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:00,369
- a great ball of fire
engulfed this room.

88
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:04,205
A fire which took my face -

89
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:09,127
- and left these few scorched patches
that now you see.

90
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:13,715
- A ball of fire?
- It was Koura's work.

91
00:16:14,965 --> 00:16:18,303
You spoke of two things
bequeathed to you.

92
00:16:18,802 --> 00:16:23,181
Here is the second.
Something the fire could not destroy.

93
00:16:24,015 --> 00:16:27,351
A token. A sign. A riddle.

94
00:16:28,186 --> 00:16:31,313
And it is said
that the riddle will be unraveled -

95
00:16:31,522 --> 00:16:33,941
- when this
and the one about your neck -

96
00:16:34,025 --> 00:16:39,863
- are placed before a great eminence
who dwells in a temple of many faces.

97
00:16:41,865 --> 00:16:44,784
And yet still incomplete.

98
00:16:46,661 --> 00:16:47,996
A perfect match.

99
00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:52,583
You see, I was right, Captain.
Destiny has brought you here.

100
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:55,628
But it is still a riddle.

101
00:16:56,462 --> 00:16:58,339
These? This?

102
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:02,509
The key to
a great and mighty secret?

103
00:17:03,218 --> 00:17:07,096
What secret?
What is to be revealed?

104
00:17:07,597 --> 00:17:11,142
Power. Absolute power.

105
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:16,480
Power to rid this land forever of
Koura's black and ugly ambitions.

106
00:17:20,651 --> 00:17:26,073
- If this fell into Koura's hands ...
- That thought constantly torments me.

107
00:17:26,364 --> 00:17:29,826
{y:i}If Koura were to obtain
{y:i}absolute power in this land, -

108
00:17:30,034 --> 00:17:32,328
{y:i}- freedom and happiness
{y:i}would be lost.

109
00:17:32,537 --> 00:17:34,413
- Forever.
- Absolute power?

110
00:17:34,497 --> 00:17:38,376
I pray to Allah,
but he does not hear me.

111
00:17:40,961 --> 00:17:45,340
Then you and I must see to it that
we solve this mystery before Koura.

112
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:47,550
If Allah be willing.

113
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:50,971
Part of it must be here.

114
00:17:53,889 --> 00:17:57,351
I see a ship. A long voyage.

115
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:02,647
- An island.
- And these foreboding symbols.

116
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:05,900
It can only mean danger of death.

117
00:18:06,526 --> 00:18:09,736
Or great riches perhaps.
A lost treasure.

118
00:18:09,946 --> 00:18:12,781
Or it could mean nothing at all.

119
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:17,995
The more I study it,
the greater the puzzle becomes.

120
00:18:19,872 --> 00:18:22,373
The golden tablets then.
What of these?

121
00:18:22,582 --> 00:18:25,377
There is a third part
still to be found.

122
00:18:25,585 --> 00:18:29,548
It must be found,
or our land will be plagued forever.

123
00:18:30,089 --> 00:18:32,592
But how to get the third?

124
00:18:40,307 --> 00:18:43,518
Vizier ...
Don't you see it?

125
00:18:43,852 --> 00:18:47,688
The meridian.
And there are shoals, an island.

126
00:18:48,022 --> 00:18:50,817
It's a chart, Grand Vizier.
A nautical chart.

127
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:56,238
And you are a sea captain.

128
00:18:57,198 --> 00:18:59,283
Allah be praised!

129
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,023
You can go home.

130
00:19:35,983 --> 00:19:39,194
- Is this a ship or a monastery?
- We sail with the tide.

131
00:19:39,402 --> 00:19:42,113
She only removed two veils!

132
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:47,326
If the winds are with us, we'll reach
this area before the rise of Venus.

133
00:19:47,535 --> 00:19:50,788
And then we follow Orion
into unknown waters.

134
00:19:52,331 --> 00:19:56,085
- Why do you stare at me?
- Do you believe in destiny?

135
00:19:56,293 --> 00:20:00,046
- That is what has brought us together.
- Possibly.

136
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:04,425
And with the help of Allah
we will surely triumph.

137
00:20:04,551 --> 00:20:07,886
There is an old proverb
I choose to believe.

138
00:20:08,304 --> 00:20:12,057
"Trust in Allah,
but tie up your camel."

139
00:20:30,491 --> 00:20:33,952
It is Koura's spy. His watchdog.

140
00:20:36,746 --> 00:20:38,331
Quick, quick!

141
00:20:45,421 --> 00:20:46,672
There!

142
00:21:05,648 --> 00:21:08,026
Already it may have betrayed us.

143
00:21:17,534 --> 00:21:20,245
In the name of the Almighty,
what was it?

144
00:21:22,122 --> 00:21:26,375
Koura's creation.
A living homunculus.

145
00:21:26,584 --> 00:21:30,546
An extension of his eyes and ears.
And with it -

146
00:21:30,755 --> 00:21:33,800
- he now knows as much as we.

147
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:37,844
It's a race then. A duel.

148
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:44,309
We seek an island.
An ultimate destination.

149
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,480
He will also seek it.

150
00:21:48,605 --> 00:21:52,857
Find me a ship
and a captain who can be trusted.

151
00:21:55,986 --> 00:21:58,905
He must make ready to sail
with the next tide.

152
00:23:24,525 --> 00:23:26,402
All right, all right!

153
00:23:26,903 --> 00:23:29,822
Excellent. You are even better
than they say you are.

154
00:23:30,031 --> 00:23:34,118
It is Sinbad, isn't it?
Captain of the ship that lies offshore?

155
00:23:37,329 --> 00:23:41,833
I'm Hakim,
owner of this aureate establishment.

156
00:23:45,462 --> 00:23:47,546
I wish to employ you.

157
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:52,968
- Sorry, I sail with the tide.
- It is only a small service.

158
00:23:53,177 --> 00:23:55,804
No longer than it takes
to drink a coffee.

159
00:23:56,012 --> 00:23:59,433
Please, just hear me.
It will only take a moment.

160
00:24:00,892 --> 00:24:07,065
It's only a small service.
This is my son Haroun. A waster, a fool.

161
00:24:07,273 --> 00:24:11,528
200 gold coins
if you take him with you.

162
00:24:12,153 --> 00:24:14,154
Take him with me?

163
00:24:16,323 --> 00:24:20,410
- I couldn't even use him for ballast.
- 300 gold coins.

164
00:24:20,619 --> 00:24:26,040
You cannot pick up two melons with
one hand, and I cannot work miracles.

165
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:36,675
Hurry, hurry.

166
00:24:46,976 --> 00:24:48,978
Come sit down.

167
00:24:52,314 --> 00:24:55,525
- The girl ...
- That girl? A worthless slave.

168
00:24:55,942 --> 00:24:58,863
But you like her?
You view her with favour?

169
00:25:01,489 --> 00:25:03,366
She's yours.

170
00:25:03,575 --> 00:25:08,245
I give her freely. A gift.
Along with my son and 400 gold coins.

171
00:25:09,914 --> 00:25:12,541
- What is your name?
- Margiana.

172
00:25:12,833 --> 00:25:15,127
That mark.

173
00:25:15,335 --> 00:25:19,423
- How did you get it?
- I've had it since I was a child.

174
00:25:20,465 --> 00:25:22,758
- An evil eye.
- No, no.

175
00:25:22,967 --> 00:25:24,927
It was tattooed on.

176
00:25:25,136 --> 00:25:29,014
- Perhaps it is a good omen.
- It's to ward off evil spirits.

177
00:25:29,097 --> 00:25:31,601
You have nothing else to tell me?

178
00:25:31,809 --> 00:25:35,353
She is curvaceous.
Not deliciously fat as I prefer.

179
00:25:35,479 --> 00:25:39,316
But at night a cotton seed
is the same as a pearl.

180
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:43,820
- She finds favour in my eyes.
- Yes? It's a bargain.

181
00:25:44,029 --> 00:25:47,573
The girl,
my son and 400 gold coins.

182
00:25:50,075 --> 00:25:54,329
- Allah will smile on you.
- More likely he will laugh at me.

183
00:25:57,374 --> 00:25:59,459
Bring them to my ship.

184
00:26:01,836 --> 00:26:04,130
It shall be done.

185
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:23,649
Very strange trip.

186
00:26:32,906 --> 00:26:36,035
- Grand Vizier!
- Look what's coming aboard.

187
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:40,622
{y:i}Salaam alaykum.

188
00:26:40,746 --> 00:26:45,000
I've heard of gold going to
a man's head, but this ...

189
00:26:45,626 --> 00:26:48,672
- Cast off.
- Cast off!

190
00:26:49,588 --> 00:26:51,382
Cast off!

191
00:26:52,716 --> 00:26:55,761
- Raise the sail up.
- Sail up!

192
00:26:59,722 --> 00:27:01,809
Fair wind, Captain.

193
00:27:02,225 --> 00:27:04,936
Aye. Fair wind and a fine one.

194
00:27:18,906 --> 00:27:21,827
Every voyage has its own flavour.

195
00:27:36,631 --> 00:27:40,050
- You know what is expected of you?
- Aye, my Lord.

196
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:44,763
In a few moments Sinbad's ship
will come around that headland.

197
00:27:45,055 --> 00:27:49,143
Follow him, Captain.
Gently, cunningly.

198
00:27:49,351 --> 00:27:52,896
Keeping him
always just within sight.

199
00:27:57,567 --> 00:28:00,821
He who is patient obtains.

200
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:12,164
You're thinking
the same as l, Rachid?

201
00:28:12,372 --> 00:28:18,003
Captain, an island. If it is here,
then it can only be one place.

202
00:28:18,336 --> 00:28:20,422
- Lemuria.
- Lemuria?

203
00:28:20,631 --> 00:28:24,383
The mythical island. Mariners have
searched for it for centuries.

204
00:28:24,592 --> 00:28:28,971
It is all that is left of a mighty
continent now sunk beneath the waves.

205
00:28:29,055 --> 00:28:32,724
It is a place of untold dangers,
of death. They say ...

206
00:28:32,933 --> 00:28:36,895
That the man who fears the unknown
will take fright of his own backside.

207
00:28:37,312 --> 00:28:40,440
There you have it. We seek Lemuria.

208
00:28:41,775 --> 00:28:45,444
We wager our skill against death.

209
00:28:45,653 --> 00:28:51,700
And for rich reward. Find this island
and a handsome prize awaits every man.

210
00:28:51,908 --> 00:28:53,869
Are you with me?

211
00:28:53,994 --> 00:28:55,746
To Lemuria!

212
00:28:56,579 --> 00:28:58,790
And a bounty to boot!

213
00:29:00,667 --> 00:29:05,045
- Even if it be into the jaws of hell?
- We cannot be bought, Captain.

214
00:29:05,254 --> 00:29:07,340
Only with money.

215
00:29:07,549 --> 00:29:11,176
Then be warned.
We can afford no laggards.

216
00:29:11,385 --> 00:29:14,847
Every man must carry
his own weight and more.

217
00:29:20,144 --> 00:29:22,645
There's water everywhere!

218
00:29:24,021 --> 00:29:27,150
- We're at sea!
- This boy is a genius.

219
00:29:31,319 --> 00:29:35,365
I remember my father's shop
and my father coming up ...

220
00:29:35,574 --> 00:29:38,617
Father! This was his idea,
wasn't it?

221
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:43,414
A quick run around the harbour
to clear the cobwebs away?

222
00:29:43,706 --> 00:29:47,668
All right. The sea breeze is beautiful,
cobwebs are all gone.

223
00:29:47,793 --> 00:29:49,670
Now we can go home.

224
00:29:49,879 --> 00:29:53,090
Sorry.
We are on course now.

225
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:56,342
- You are with us all the way.
- All the way?

226
00:29:58,636 --> 00:30:03,932
Well, things could be worse. A couple
of days away from home isn't too bad.

227
00:30:05,727 --> 00:30:07,479
A couple of weeks?

228
00:30:08,228 --> 00:30:09,980
A month?

229
00:30:10,314 --> 00:30:13,525
- More than a month?
- Two, three years perhaps.

230
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:18,655
Two or three years?!
But I'll be an old man by then.

231
00:30:20,324 --> 00:30:26,788
- Show me to my cabin so I can lie down.
- No cabin. You bunk with the men.

232
00:30:27,079 --> 00:30:29,790
You want to eat, you work.

233
00:30:30,332 --> 00:30:33,044
Work? Work?!

234
00:30:34,294 --> 00:30:36,379
This is terrible!

235
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:00,568
Haroun.

236
00:31:05,573 --> 00:31:08,367
You pace the deck like a caged beast.

237
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:11,620
For one who enjoys hashish
you should be more at peace.

238
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:14,748
- I'll put you on watch.
- On watch?

239
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:17,668
All you have to do is sit down
and keep a sharp lookout.

240
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:20,253
Sit down and look? Fine.

241
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,589
Haroun ...

242
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,300
Up there.

243
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:32,473
That's where you sit.

244
00:32:09,256 --> 00:32:12,301
I forget I have company.
Your pardon.

245
00:32:15,428 --> 00:32:19,390
No, no. I am the one who bows.
You are my guest.

246
00:32:20,641 --> 00:32:24,061
- But I am your slave.
- Slave? Up, up.

247
00:32:24,604 --> 00:32:27,398
- You own me now.
- Own you?

248
00:32:28,982 --> 00:32:32,611
No human being has
the right to own another.

249
00:32:33,028 --> 00:32:35,030
You are free now.

250
00:32:37,199 --> 00:32:40,118
You belong to no one
but yourself.

251
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:47,625
On this ship you are at no one's
beck and call. You understand that?

252
00:32:53,797 --> 00:32:56,092
Right. I go to change.

253
00:32:57,134 --> 00:32:58,676
Fetch me a drink.

254
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:06,183
Please.

255
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:22,031
- You will be sleeping in here?
- Of course.

256
00:33:28,286 --> 00:33:31,331
Captain Sinbad! Sinbad!

257
00:33:31,748 --> 00:33:33,208
Aye?

258
00:33:35,085 --> 00:33:37,796
Haroun saw a light on the horizon.

259
00:33:51,642 --> 00:33:53,226
Over there.

260
00:33:54,477 --> 00:33:57,063
- A ship.
- Following us?

261
00:33:59,065 --> 00:34:01,568
- Stay on this course.
- Aye.

262
00:34:02,068 --> 00:34:05,529
If she's still with us at daybreak,
we know.

263
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,703
It is Koura.

264
00:34:13,454 --> 00:34:14,997
Aye.

265
00:34:17,624 --> 00:34:21,587
- I should come about and sink him.
- If he does not sink us first.

266
00:34:21,795 --> 00:34:26,590
Sinbad has sent more pirates to
the bottom of the sea than I can count.

267
00:34:27,424 --> 00:34:32,012
There is much at stake, my friend.
We must maintain our lead.

268
00:34:32,095 --> 00:34:35,640
With a ship like that?
We can't outrun him forever.

269
00:34:35,974 --> 00:34:38,769
But if you can outwit him ...

270
00:34:44,106 --> 00:34:48,152
The cabin looks very neat.
You have all a woman's gifts.

271
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:57,327
- Yes, all of them. Save one.
- What is that?

272
00:34:58,161 --> 00:35:02,874
Curiosity. You never ask why
I brought you along on this voyage.

273
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:07,253
I've only just become a free woman.
Slaves do not ask questions.

274
00:35:07,462 --> 00:35:09,630
I'm happy you brought me along.

275
00:35:10,589 --> 00:35:16,095
We're being hunted, pursued like prey.
And I must lose the hunter.

276
00:35:16,428 --> 00:35:19,138
- Who pursues us?
- A man.

277
00:35:20,056 --> 00:35:22,975
A great, black bat of a man.

278
00:35:24,977 --> 00:35:29,023
He is one of the reasons you are here.
He, and that mark on your hand.

279
00:35:29,773 --> 00:35:32,484
But why? Why?

280
00:35:33,318 --> 00:35:35,612
I wish I knew myself.

281
00:35:36,446 --> 00:35:38,322
Hold steady.

282
00:35:41,118 --> 00:35:44,370
We lead him into
this area of dense mist here.

283
00:35:44,578 --> 00:35:47,998
There's enough rocks
to snare a prow or rip open a keel.

284
00:35:48,124 --> 00:35:51,251
But if you lead him there,
you run the same risk yourself.

285
00:35:51,459 --> 00:35:56,131
Not quite the same. I've navigated
these waters before. Eh, Rachid?

286
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:59,050
Once before.

287
00:36:11,562 --> 00:36:13,564
We'll abandon the chains!

288
00:36:24,823 --> 00:36:28,035
How can he see to steer the ship?
It's terrible.

289
00:36:28,161 --> 00:36:32,330
- How can he see anything?
- The captain won't need to see.

290
00:36:32,414 --> 00:36:35,333
He'll feel his way through.

291
00:36:42,339 --> 00:36:44,216
Drop anchor!

292
00:36:44,925 --> 00:36:47,762
Not yet. Pursue that ship!

293
00:36:48,596 --> 00:36:51,723
Continue into this?
We will be wrecked.

294
00:36:51,931 --> 00:36:57,228
- Well, Sinbad navigates these waters.
- Then he must have a chart to follow.

295
00:37:24,044 --> 00:37:26,964
- Three points east.
- Aye, Captain.

296
00:37:28,423 --> 00:37:30,717
As Allah wills.

297
00:38:51,208 --> 00:38:53,376
It's alive! It's moving!

298
00:38:55,253 --> 00:38:57,881
It's alive! It's alive!

299
00:40:56,823 --> 00:40:58,908
For the love of Allah! The chart!

300
00:40:59,117 --> 00:41:03,288
- It's taken the chart!
- Never mind. Fight it with fire.

301
00:42:07,012 --> 00:42:09,598
{y:i}Return. Return.

302
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,267
Return.

303
00:42:37,665 --> 00:42:39,834
She's sunk.
Straight to the bottom.

304
00:42:40,043 --> 00:42:44,130
- lmpossible. Wood floats.
- The harpoon was made of iron.

305
00:42:44,338 --> 00:42:48,175
- It took the chart.
- But I still carry the course.

306
00:42:49,135 --> 00:42:50,677
Here.

307
00:43:09,445 --> 00:43:11,030
Return ...

308
00:43:11,738 --> 00:43:13,323
{y:i}Return.

309
00:43:14,241 --> 00:43:18,745
Return ... Return now.

310
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,961
Return!

311
00:43:27,378 --> 00:43:32,090
To him who breathed life into you.
Return!

312
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,302
{y:i}Return ...

313
00:43:44,685 --> 00:43:46,145
Master?

314
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:55,528
Master.

315
00:44:01,992 --> 00:44:05,120
Your face ... It's aged.

316
00:44:06,789 --> 00:44:09,416
Master, you are ill.

317
00:44:11,084 --> 00:44:13,462
You saw everything.

318
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:17,632
- I came when I heard your cry.
- Then you know.

319
00:44:18,174 --> 00:44:22,345
- Enough, Master.
- Yes, yes ...

320
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:28,809
You will die if you go on.

321
00:44:29,017 --> 00:44:32,646
To summon the demons of darkness
has a price.

322
00:44:34,439 --> 00:44:39,653
And each time I call upon them,
it consumes part of me.

323
00:44:41,112 --> 00:44:44,656
Come, Achmed.
We have no time to lose.

324
00:44:48,202 --> 00:44:52,039
Haul it aboard! Easy, easy.

325
00:45:10,304 --> 00:45:12,057
Your sword.

326
00:45:24,067 --> 00:45:26,778
Bring us back on course, Captain.

327
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:48,339
- You like the lute, Captain?
- Very much. Play me a tune sometime.

328
00:45:49,174 --> 00:45:51,594
But I was playing a tune.

329
00:45:53,053 --> 00:45:55,555
Land ho!

330
00:46:06,065 --> 00:46:07,858
Lemuria.

331
00:46:08,067 --> 00:46:11,487
Where we are destined
to find our answer.

332
00:46:11,695 --> 00:46:16,199
- We go ashore at daybreak!
- May good fortune accompany us.

333
00:46:44,767 --> 00:46:47,060
The captain reports
we are well on course.

334
00:46:47,268 --> 00:46:50,398
But there is no hope
of overtaking Sinbad?

335
00:46:51,023 --> 00:46:57,070
No matter, Achmed. I expected such
a possibility. I am prepared for it.

336
00:47:26,138 --> 00:47:31,059
Mandrake root and a few chemicals
is all that is needed.

337
00:47:43,779 --> 00:47:48,033
No! Don't throw stones
in the well that you drink from.

338
00:47:48,158 --> 00:47:51,995
Do you dare defy
the demons of darkness?

339
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:55,248
I've watched them
drain your strength.

340
00:47:55,874 --> 00:47:59,418
Look! See what they have
done to you already.

341
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:08,677
If you continue, you will perish
before this journey is over.

342
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:14,432
Have you no faith in my powers?
We are soon to triumph, Achmed.

343
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:22,148
My life,
my blood shall bring life.

344
00:48:53,218 --> 00:48:56,971
Don't fear it, Achmed.
It is our friend.

345
00:50:16,627 --> 00:50:18,087
Come on.

346
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:42,902
You will find Sinbad,
my little friend. Seek him out.

347
00:50:46,238 --> 00:50:49,157
Magic purges the soul, Achmed.

348
00:50:50,408 --> 00:50:56,247
The night with its ears
and the day with its eyes.

349
00:51:18,433 --> 00:51:19,686
Come ashore.

350
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:16,612
There's someone moving.

351
00:52:18,281 --> 00:52:19,532
Beckoning.

352
00:53:04,073 --> 00:53:06,659
I didn't expect you to volunteer.

353
00:53:06,784 --> 00:53:09,702
Any land is good for these legs.

354
00:53:10,119 --> 00:53:11,789
Even dangerous land?

355
00:53:11,997 --> 00:53:15,416
Dangerous? You never told me
it would be dangerous.

356
00:53:15,625 --> 00:53:17,210
You didn't ask.

357
00:53:33,141 --> 00:53:36,185
To land on these shores
is cause for celebration.

358
00:53:36,395 --> 00:53:40,439
Have them return to the ship
and see that every man gets wine.

359
00:53:47,112 --> 00:53:52,450
I know you propose we go alone into
this place. But just the two of us?

360
00:53:54,327 --> 00:53:59,123
We shall not lack for protection,
Achmed. We shall not lack for that.

361
00:54:11,218 --> 00:54:12,552
Stop!

362
00:54:23,604 --> 00:54:25,397
Sinbad, look!

363
00:55:12,315 --> 00:55:14,400
Your courage has deserted you?

364
00:55:14,609 --> 00:55:18,029
Me? No.
My heart is full of bravery.

365
00:55:19,905 --> 00:55:21,783
But I have cowardly legs.

366
00:55:30,457 --> 00:55:34,085
As it was written:
A temple with many faces.

367
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:37,129
The temple of
the Oracle of All Knowledge.

368
00:55:37,338 --> 00:55:42,426
But I never thought to stand here.
We must seek out the great eminence.

369
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:45,817
- Is it the oracle?
- No, a guardian.

370
00:56:45,942 --> 00:56:49,362
The keeper to whom
we should present ourselves.

371
00:57:02,916 --> 00:57:05,335
I bring you a token.

372
00:57:05,627 --> 00:57:08,756
A sign from the sultans of Marabia.

373
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,929
We come humbly seeking
the Oracle of All Knowledge.

374
00:57:18,138 --> 00:57:21,684
Two golden tablets that fit as one.

375
00:58:29,578 --> 00:58:36,252
Two tablets brought forth to the light,
yet a third remains from sight.

376
00:58:36,752 --> 00:58:37,586
A third?

377
00:58:37,795 --> 00:58:43,550
A final place must still be found,
a place that lies deep below the ground.

378
00:58:43,758 --> 00:58:48,555
- He talks in riddles.
- No race is lost until it's won.

379
00:58:48,763 --> 00:58:52,517
And close behind you
comes the black and evil son.

380
00:58:52,726 --> 00:58:58,148
{y:i}Spawned by the Devil, suckled upon
{y:i}black milk, in human form.

381
00:59:00,232 --> 00:59:03,235
{y:i}Clad in robes of silk.

382
00:59:04,695 --> 00:59:07,739
Destiny, destiny.

383
00:59:07,947 --> 00:59:13,786
Destiny is invisible yet visible,
and men may try to hide.

384
00:59:13,995 --> 00:59:19,834
Yet its waters mark you clearly
like a rainbow in the sky.

385
00:59:21,084 --> 00:59:26,798
{y:i}Destiny is a place
{y:i}where both good and evil wait.

386
00:59:26,923 --> 00:59:31,178
{y:i}And yet their very equality
{y:i}negates their power.

387
00:59:32,346 --> 00:59:36,724
{y:i}For it is the very deeds
{y:i}of weak and mortal men -

388
00:59:36,807 --> 00:59:39,935
- that may tip the scales
one way or the other.

389
00:59:40,144 --> 00:59:44,649
And then the world shall lo,
and you shall know -

390
00:59:44,857 --> 00:59:49,527
- which way the Fates have chosen
you shall go.

391
00:59:49,861 --> 00:59:51,321
Go!

392
00:59:52,364 --> 00:59:54,448
Go now!

393
00:59:54,865 --> 00:59:57,452
- Go?
- Go north.

394
00:59:58,494 --> 01:00:05,292
North to barren lands
of pagan places and pagan bands.

395
01:00:06,001 --> 01:00:11,339
Before a goddess
cast with many limbs.

396
01:00:13,299 --> 01:00:18,638
And death to all intruders
is their whim.

397
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:21,223
{y:i}In that sacred place -

398
01:00:21,348 --> 01:00:26,228
- hid from the eyes of man
is the third gold tablet -

399
01:00:26,436 --> 01:00:29,272
- that completes the plan.

400
01:00:29,898 --> 01:00:32,067
Go now.

401
01:00:34,902 --> 01:00:37,488
Go now.

402
01:00:38,322 --> 01:00:42,492
Go north ... Go north ...

403
01:01:51,014 --> 01:01:53,307
Back! Go back!

404
01:01:55,059 --> 01:01:58,103
Go! Down here! Inside!

405
01:02:31,050 --> 01:02:32,510
Captain!

406
01:02:33,970 --> 01:02:36,764
The entrance is blocked!

407
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:47,816
Farewell, Sinbad.

408
01:02:56,074 --> 01:02:59,410
Perhaps it is our destiny
to be buried alive.

409
01:02:59,618 --> 01:03:02,538
A man's destiny
lies in his own hands.

410
01:03:03,872 --> 01:03:07,125
A live dog is better
than a dead lion.

411
01:03:13,255 --> 01:03:15,258
Rachid, your bow.

412
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:19,845
All of you, your turbans and sashes.
Make a strong rope.

413
01:03:26,309 --> 01:03:29,229
I knew we'd go mad down here
eventually.

414
01:03:40,489 --> 01:03:43,617
An arrow.
A straight, sure arrow.

415
01:03:45,577 --> 01:03:47,787
A strong rope.

416
01:03:54,878 --> 01:03:57,671
Come on, men. Trust in Allah.

417
01:03:58,422 --> 01:04:00,507
But tie up your camel.

418
01:04:01,342 --> 01:04:04,260
Do as he says.
Your turbans and sashes.

419
01:04:04,969 --> 01:04:06,555
Hurry, hurry!

420
01:04:11,434 --> 01:04:13,227
Tie strong.

421
01:04:15,939 --> 01:04:17,397
Strong.

422
01:04:21,568 --> 01:04:23,320
Good, good.

423
01:04:25,529 --> 01:04:27,199
Rachid.

424
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:52,304
Sinbad, you've done it!

425
01:05:11,406 --> 01:05:14,826
- I'm the lightest.
- But I'm the most foolhardy.

426
01:05:22,541 --> 01:05:24,750
- Easy, Captain.
- He's going too fast.

427
01:05:36,095 --> 01:05:37,470
Up you go.

428
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:53,737
Go on, Captain.

429
01:06:04,370 --> 01:06:06,123
Sinbad, look out!

430
01:06:38,986 --> 01:06:40,946
What is it, Master?

431
01:07:05,552 --> 01:07:08,680
All of you, up you come.
Margiana first.

432
01:07:59,560 --> 01:08:01,144
Moving north.

433
01:08:01,978 --> 01:08:06,149
- It is as the oracle said.
- There's a steep climb ahead.

434
01:09:40,485 --> 01:09:42,488
What is it, Master?

435
01:09:44,364 --> 01:09:48,326
They mean to sacrifice us
to their living god. Don't!

436
01:09:56,667 --> 01:10:00,921
O mighty Kali.
Mightier than thou am I.

437
01:10:01,338 --> 01:10:03,424
Make obeisance to me!

438
01:11:13,196 --> 01:11:16,531
Dance! Dance for me!

439
01:11:51,438 --> 01:11:52,482
Stop!

440
01:12:04,701 --> 01:12:06,370
- Achmed ...
- Master?

441
01:12:06,578 --> 01:12:10,331
I shall remain
and commune with their deity. Go!

442
01:12:13,877 --> 01:12:15,335
Go now.

443
01:12:30,349 --> 01:12:37,022
{y:i}In that sacred place hid from the eyes
{y:i}of man is the third gold tablet.

444
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:42,652
The third tablet is here somewhere.
And I shall find it.

445
01:13:02,754 --> 01:13:04,339
I shall find it!

446
01:13:49,046 --> 01:13:52,383
I won't be denied! I won't!

447
01:14:01,266 --> 01:14:02,725
Koura!

448
01:14:05,853 --> 01:14:07,939
We meet again.

449
01:14:20,033 --> 01:14:22,618
- To the death.
- To the death.

450
01:14:39,217 --> 01:14:42,429
To the death, Kali.
Death to our enemy.

451
01:15:53,452 --> 01:15:55,746
No, wait! Don't!

452
01:15:56,664 --> 01:15:57,706
Stay back!

453
01:17:02,141 --> 01:17:03,182
Stand clear!

454
01:18:28,469 --> 01:18:30,888
The third golden tablet.

455
01:19:03,918 --> 01:19:05,795
Here it is written -

456
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:10,090
- that the Fountain of Destiny
lies within easy march.

457
01:19:10,507 --> 01:19:14,761
Yes. Where the gods
smile upon mortal men.

458
01:19:14,970 --> 01:19:18,514
But I shall not enter
that hallowed place empty-handed.

459
01:19:18,723 --> 01:19:20,184
For it is also written -

460
01:19:20,309 --> 01:19:25,397
- that he who places these tablets
into the waters of the fountain -

461
01:19:25,606 --> 01:19:27,481
- shall receive in turn:

462
01:19:28,107 --> 01:19:29,692
Youth.

463
01:19:30,735 --> 01:19:32,904
A shield of darkness.

464
01:19:33,029 --> 01:19:37,073
And best of all:
A crown of untold riches.

465
01:19:38,033 --> 01:19:40,952
All this is my destiny.

466
01:19:41,786 --> 01:19:48,042
But I fear your destiny lies before you.
Have you not destroyed their shrine?

467
01:19:52,087 --> 01:19:55,966
May Allah receive you.
I bid you farewell.

468
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:23,282
Their journey is over and mine almost.
Return to the ship, Achmed.

469
01:20:23,491 --> 01:20:28,079
- To hear is to obey, Master.
- Have the crew make ready to leave.

470
01:20:28,788 --> 01:20:30,372
Sire.

471
01:20:41,716 --> 01:20:46,304
They think she is one of their own.
A goddess. We are saved.

472
01:20:46,847 --> 01:20:51,226
No, she is the chosen one
of their God of the Single Eye.

473
01:21:22,795 --> 01:21:24,798
- Sinbad!
- Margiana!

474
01:23:29,495 --> 01:23:31,372
Vizier, take off your mask.

475
01:23:31,789 --> 01:23:33,748
Uncover your face!

476
01:24:10,158 --> 01:24:11,909
Sinbad!

477
01:24:30,676 --> 01:24:33,094
Into the tunnel! This way!

478
01:25:32,607 --> 01:25:34,819
Rachid, over there.

479
01:25:36,903 --> 01:25:40,240
Vizier, in there.
We must find Margiana.

480
01:26:09,850 --> 01:26:12,645
Let them sustain me!

481
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:11,783
Margiana? Margiana?

482
01:27:56,197 --> 01:27:59,826
The Fountain of Destiny.
The final place.

483
01:29:26,906 --> 01:29:29,617
Margiana ... Come.

484
01:29:43,797 --> 01:29:46,924
You followed me instead of Koura?

485
01:29:47,633 --> 01:29:51,387
- Then he has won this race.
- The race perhaps.

486
01:29:51,595 --> 01:29:55,056
- And the prize?
- Not the prize.

487
01:29:55,683 --> 01:30:00,353
- A crown of untold riches ...
- I regret nothing.

488
01:30:36,136 --> 01:30:39,473
Frightened you, huh?
Margiana?

489
01:30:54,068 --> 01:30:56,363
The final place.

490
01:31:41,822 --> 01:31:46,075
The energy of youth is mine again.
You are too late, Sinbad.

491
01:31:48,786 --> 01:31:53,498
The shield of darkness, a crown
of many riches. I'll deny you these.

492
01:31:53,707 --> 01:31:58,169
O gods and demons of darkness!
Rid me forever of this enemy -

493
01:31:58,294 --> 01:32:03,091
- who stands between me
and my destiny! I'll plead!

494
01:32:05,801 --> 01:32:08,929
- They don't hear you, Koura.
- I implore!

495
01:32:36,455 --> 01:32:38,122
Kill him!

496
01:32:38,330 --> 01:32:40,500
Destroy Sinbad!

497
01:35:05,967 --> 01:35:08,051
It is as the oracle foretold.

498
01:35:08,135 --> 01:35:11,805
The forces of good and evil
battling eternally.

499
01:35:12,222 --> 01:35:16,684
It also foretold that it is
the deeds of weak and mortal men.

500
01:35:16,809 --> 01:35:20,354
{y:i}That may tip the scales
{y:i}one way or the other.

501
01:36:07,898 --> 01:36:09,149
Rachid!

502
01:36:39,385 --> 01:36:40,719
Sinbad!

503
01:36:52,814 --> 01:36:54,065
No!

504
01:37:33,393 --> 01:37:35,061
Oh no!

505
01:37:58,083 --> 01:37:59,542
And now, Sinbad ...

506
01:37:59,667 --> 01:38:03,713
- A shield of darkness shall be mine.
- I see no shield.

507
01:38:05,089 --> 01:38:06,757
You will.

508
01:38:28,027 --> 01:38:32,072
Look carefully, Sinbad.
What you cannot see, you cannot kill.

509
01:38:51,798 --> 01:38:54,093
I congratulate you, Captain.

510
01:38:54,510 --> 01:38:58,138
Your sword arm is excellent,
but your eyes betray you.

511
01:38:58,346 --> 01:39:00,640
For now you cannot see me at all.

512
01:39:01,599 --> 01:39:04,601
For all your strength
you are helpless.

513
01:39:04,810 --> 01:39:07,439
As helpless as a child.

514
01:39:07,938 --> 01:39:11,483
I can kill you any time, Captain.
Any time.

515
01:39:54,147 --> 01:39:55,607
Am I here?

516
01:39:58,109 --> 01:40:00,195
Or right beside you?

517
01:40:00,403 --> 01:40:01,863
No ...

518
01:40:02,571 --> 01:40:07,367
You cannot kill me.
But I can destroy you. All of you.

519
01:40:19,379 --> 01:40:20,421
Sinbad!

520
01:41:57,259 --> 01:42:00,096
A crown of untold riches.

521
01:42:11,231 --> 01:42:12,691
Your Majesty.

522
01:42:12,816 --> 01:42:17,488
Are you not the true and worthy
successor to the throne of Marabia?

523
01:42:17,696 --> 01:42:20,615
And has not Allah delivered this -

524
01:42:20,823 --> 01:42:25,620
- into my hands from the wondrous
waters of the Fountain of Destiny -

525
01:42:25,745 --> 01:42:28,038
- to rest upon your head?

526
01:43:10,452 --> 01:43:13,788
Praise be to Allah the All-merciful.

527
01:43:39,353 --> 01:43:42,898
I can't understand.
Sinbad, why did you do it?

528
01:43:43,107 --> 01:43:47,152
Give away a whole kingdom,
priceless treasure. Why?

529
01:43:49,238 --> 01:43:53,116
I value freedom.
A king is never truly free.

530
01:43:54,993 --> 01:43:57,912
Why, he is even told
who he must marry.

531
01:44:03,543 --> 01:44:06,044
Captain! Captain!

532
01:44:06,545 --> 01:44:09,798
Will you take me on
as a fully-fledged seaman now?

533
01:44:10,007 --> 01:44:12,383
Aye. And make yourself fast
with that rope.

534
01:44:12,508 --> 01:44:15,429
Don't worry.
I always trust in Allah.

535
01:44:18,556 --> 01:44:20,099
But tie up your camel.
