	<SYNC Start=261640>
	  <P>The year is 1893.
	<SYNC Start=264840>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=265050>
	  <P>Champaner.
	<SYNC Start=266650>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=267330>
	  <P>A small village in<br>the heart of India.
	<SYNC Start=271650>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=274050>
	  <P>The people of Champaner<br>depended on agriculture ...
	<SYNC Start=277850>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=278050>
	  <P>... like those in<br>thousands of villages.
	<SYNC Start=280840>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=282810>
	  <P>A British cantonment<br>bordered the village.
	<SYNC Start=287520>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=290120>
	  <P>Two miles south, beyond<br>the cantonment, was the fort ...
	<SYNC Start=293770>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=294000>
	  <P>... of the Rajah<br>of this province.
	<SYNC Start=296840>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=297080>
	  <P>The British protected the Rajah's<br>domain from neighbouring attacks.
	<SYNC Start=301240>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=301480>
	  <P>They also promised the other Rajahs<br>protection from this Rajah.
	<SYNC Start=306250>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=306680>
	  <P>Thanks to this double-dealing,<br>the British ...
	<SYNC Start=309650>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=309850>
	  <P>... collected a tax from the Rajahs ...
	<SYNC Start=313360>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=313520>
	  <P>... paid by every farmer<br>in the country.
	<SYNC Start=315880>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=317890>
	  <P>Lagaan:
	<SYNC Start=319640>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=320730>
	  <P>The submission of a portion<br>of the farmer's harvest ...
	<SYNC Start=324840>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=325080>
	  <P>... to the Rajah as tax.
	<SYNC Start=327120>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=329040>
	  <P>"Every Rajah collected" lagaan "from"<br>villages under his rule.
	<SYNC Start=334240>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=336120>
	  <P>The Rajah would keep one share ...
	<SYNC Start=338480>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=338720>
	  <P>... and give the rest to the British.
	<SYNC Start=341840>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=342880>
	  <P>In this way, the British fist<br>grew iron strong.
	<SYNC Start=346920>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=347330>
	  <P>Like thousands of villages<br>across the country ...
	<SYNC Start=350440>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=350680>
	  <P>... the farmers of Champaner<br>toiled on empty bellies ...
	<SYNC Start=354000>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=354210>
	  <P>... and paid taxes to the Rajah<br>every year.
	<SYNC Start=357240>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=361530>
	  <P>Last year it rained,<br>but very little.
	<SYNC Start=365450>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=365920>
	  <P>And this year, there has been<br>no rain so far.
	<SYNC Start=369890>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=373000>
	  <P>Dry eyes ...
	<SYNC Start=375240>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=375480>
	  <P>... scan the sky.
	<SYNC Start=377840>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=394920>
	  <P>You're there again!<br>What are you looking at, Mother?
	<SYNC Start=398360>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=400890>
	  <P>Just wondering when the sky<br>will darken with clouds.
	<SYNC Start=404860>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=405140>
	  <P>How I long for the rains.
	<SYNC Start=407250>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=407460>
	  <P>A month of rainy season gone by<br>and not a drop of rain.
	<SYNC Start=411650>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=413140>
	  <P>Coming, coming.
	<SYNC Start=414660>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=416020>
	  <P>By God's grace,<br>at least we have drinking water.
	<SYNC Start=419900>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=420130>
	  <P>Or we'd be parched to the bone.
	<SYNC Start=422650>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=423340>
	  <P>- Such are his ways.<br>- Yes, Mother.
	<SYNC Start=425740>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=425940>
	  <P>The fields are parched.<br>How will the grains ripen?
	<SYNC Start=429900>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=430130>
	  <P>Don't lose heart, Hari "Bhai."
	<SYNC Start=432340>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=433060>
	  <P>We'll dig into the earth.
	<SYNC Start=436300>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=436530>
	  <P>We'll tear up the earth for water.
	<SYNC Start=438890>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=439130>
	  <P>It's what I told Bhuvan.
	<SYNC Start=441100>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=441330>
	  <P>Where is he?
	<SYNC Start=443060>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=443490>
	  <P>He went out in the morning.
	<SYNC Start=445660>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=446410>
	  <P>It's time to eat.<br>Send him home if you see him.
	<SYNC Start=449660>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=449890>
	  <P>Yes, Mother.
	<SYNC Start=451050>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=452540>
	  <P>You pests!<br>I'll wring your necks!
	<SYNC Start=454890>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=455730>
	  <P>Oh, no!<br>The Great Chicken War again.
	<SYNC Start=458940>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=459140>
	  <P>Goli, you moron!
	<SYNC Start=461490>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=461730>
	  <P>See if I don't ram you<br>down a gun barrel!
	<SYNC Start=464810>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=465020>
	  <P>Morons!<br>You think these are your own hens!
	<SYNC Start=467850>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=468810>
	  <P>Go to hell, Bhura!
	<SYNC Start=470570>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=470810>
	  <P>Come here, I'll show you.
	<SYNC Start=472890>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=473100>
	  <P>- Wait right there!<br>- Come on!
	<SYNC Start=475370>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=475580>
	  <P>- I'll put you in bed for days!<br>- How dare you hit my kids?
	<SYNC Start=479370>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=479610>
	  <P>I'll hang them<br>and burn chilies under them.
	<SYNC Start=482450>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=482690>
	  <P>Hassling my hens!<br>And you?!
	<SYNC Start=484970>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=485210>
	  <P>You behave or else<br>I'll burn your slingshot!
	<SYNC Start=488460>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=488660>
	  <P>- Is that so?<br>- Stop it now.
	<SYNC Start=490450>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=490660>
	  <P>You two are worse<br>than cats and dogs.
	<SYNC Start=494250>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=494460>
	  <P>But his boys are after my hens!
	<SYNC Start=496700>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=496930>
	  <P>Stop acting like<br>they're being molested!
	<SYNC Start=499660>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=499890>
	  <P>Your hens aren't getting married!
	<SYNC Start=502300>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=502530>
	  <P>They're only kids.<br>Goli, control your kids.
	<SYNC Start=506090>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=506330>
	  <P>Tell me, have you seen Bhuvan?
	<SYNC Start=508450>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=508690>
	  <P>- No. You seen him, Bhura?<br>- No!
	<SYNC Start=511420>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=511650>
	  <P>Why?
	<SYNC Start=513050>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=519650>
	  <P>Left, right, left!
	<SYNC Start=521450>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=546220>
	  <P>Scumbags!<br>Sons of jackals!
	<SYNC Start=550180>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=551330>
	  <P>Strutting around in the heat!
	<SYNC Start=553500>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=553930>
	  <P>You're all going back<br>to that little island ...
	<SYNC Start=556900>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=557130>
	  <P>... whimpering!
	<SYNC Start=558500>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=558730>
	  <P>May the mighty hands of Fate<br>ruin you!
	<SYNC Start=561660>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=561860>
	  <P>Guran! Why bother<br>reading their fortune?
	<SYNC Start=564970>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=565210>
	  <P>They won't even care.<br>Won't you read my fortune?
	<SYNC Start=569250>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=576330>
	  <P>Tell me. Will I get the prince<br>of my dreams?
	<SYNC Start=579770>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=579980>
	  <P>Why not?
	<SYNC Start=581100>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=581250>
	  <P>If you truly love him,<br>then he'll give you ...
	<SYNC Start=584140>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=584340>
	  <P>... your wedding bangle.<br>You'll be his bride.
	<SYNC Start=587650>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=587890>
	  <P>- Really? You heard that, Jigni?<br>- Yes.
	<SYNC Start=591100>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=591300>
	  <P>But ...
	<SYNC Start=592300>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=593170>
	  <P>But ...<br>But what?
	<SYNC Start=595050>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=595290>
	  <P>I see an obstacle.
	<SYNC Start=597090>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=597330>
	  <P>What obstacle?<br>Tell me quickly.
	<SYNC Start=599500>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=599730>
	  <P>Gauri!
	<SYNC Start=601430>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=601630>
	  <P>Later.
	<SYNC Start=602900>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=603140>
	  <P>Read my fortune.
	<SYNC Start=604510>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=604940>
	  <P>What is it, "Kaka"?
	<SYNC Start=606190>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=606420>
	  <P>- Was Guran telling your fortune?<br>- No.
	<SYNC Start=608910>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=609140>
	  <P>- Yes.<br>- He's mad.
	<SYNC Start=611060>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=611270>
	  <P>No clue about the present<br>and he babbles about the future!
	<SYNC Start=615190>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=615420>
	  <P>No, Hari "Kaka."<br>He's not mad.
	<SYNC Start=617700>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=617940>
	  <P>What about Durga "Bhabi"?
	<SYNC Start=619500>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=619740>
	  <P>She was childless for nine years.<br>Then Guran said she'd have a son.
	<SYNC Start=624260>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=624470>
	  <P>And wasn't Somu born?<br>What about--?
	<SYNC Start=626780>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=627020>
	  <P>All right, all right.<br>That lunatic is not mad.
	<SYNC Start=630990>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=631460>
	  <P>Now tell me.<br>Have you seen Bhuvan?
	<SYNC Start=634670>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=634950>
	  <P>No, but I know where he will be.
	<SYNC Start=637460>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=637670>
	  <P>Amazing!
	<SYNC Start=639510>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=639740>
	  <P>So our little girl keeps tabs<br>on him?
	<SYNC Start=642500>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=642660>
	  <P>Lakha, what is it to you?
	<SYNC Start=644300>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=644540>
	  <P>I see! This concerns me<br>and I'm not to open my mouth?
	<SYNC Start=649470>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=650340>
	  <P>Why don't you wear<br>wedding bangles for me?
	<SYNC Start=653180>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=653420>
	  <P>- Lakha, what nonsense is this?!<br>- I really mean it.
	<SYNC Start=656830>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=657030>
	  <P>You've grown old ...
	<SYNC Start=658900>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=659140>
	  <P>... and Gauri here<br>doesn't care for me.
	<SYNC Start=662350>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=662580>
	  <P>Here, look at this. Look.
	<SYNC Start=665340>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=665580>
	  <P>- See how badly hurt I am.<br>- Hurt?
	<SYNC Start=667790>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=669540>
	  <P>It's my father you need, not me.
	<SYNC Start=672470>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=672670>
	  <P>- Father!<br>- What is it?
	<SYNC Start=674510>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=674740>
	  <P>Lakha has a gash on his hand.
	<SYNC Start=677470>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=678550>
	  <P>He seems to cut his hand<br>more than he cuts wood.
	<SYNC Start=682550>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=682750>
	  <P>What can I do, lsar "Chacha"?!<br>I'm always wounding myself ...
	<SYNC Start=686860>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=687100>
	  <P>... very badly.
	<SYNC Start=688350>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=689670>
	  <P>"Kaka," I'll go fetch Bhuvan.
	<SYNC Start=693070>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=693750>
	  <P>Listen, if you see him,<br>tell him Mother is waiting for him.
	<SYNC Start=697580>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=697740>
	  <P>Yes, I'll tell him.
	<SYNC Start=699140>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=740940>
	  <P>One.
	<SYNC Start=742460>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=743950>
	  <P>Two.
	<SYNC Start=745470>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=746070>
	  <P>Three.
	<SYNC Start=747270>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=748470>
	  <P>Missed again.
	<SYNC Start=749470>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=749700>
	  <P>Ram Singh!<br>Quick! From there.
	<SYNC Start=752110>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=752340>
	  <P>Wesson, you go round.<br>Let's corner the blasted animal!
	<SYNC Start=755990>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=796830>
	  <P>One ...
	<SYNC Start=798270>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=801240>
	  <P>Drop the stone.
	<SYNC Start=802720>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=809350>
	  <P>Finally. Got the darn creature.
	<SYNC Start=812070>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=812280>
	  <P>Well done, "sahib."<br>Good shot.
	<SYNC Start=814390>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=814550>
	  <P>Thank you, Ram Singh.
	<SYNC Start=816040>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=816320>
	  <P>Now for something bigger.
	<SYNC Start=818480>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=820680>
	  <P>Arrest him.
	<SYNC Start=822280>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=822560>
	  <P>Sir, this dacoit<br>was hiding in the bushes ...
	<SYNC Start=826000>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=826150>
	  <P>... with this stone.
	<SYNC Start=827880>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=828080>
	  <P>He'd been distracting the deer.
	<SYNC Start=830320>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=834000>
	  <P>Now I understand ...
	<SYNC Start=835680>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=837310>
	  <P>... why I missed five times.
	<SYNC Start=841470>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=842870>
	  <P>You, a protector of animals, eh?
	<SYNC Start=846630>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=846840>
	  <P>He's a farmer from Champaner.
	<SYNC Start=849000>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=849430>
	  <P>Well, you must be a very good runner.
	<SYNC Start=853190>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=871070>
	  <P>Try saving this one.
	<SYNC Start=872910>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=880950>
	  <P>Next time, I will shoot you.
	<SYNC Start=883510>

	<SYNC Start=946560>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=946710>
	  <P>I was looking for you.<br>I couldn't see you.
	<SYNC Start=949680>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=949880>
	  <P>- Was I lying dead somewhere?<br>- How should I know?
	<SYNC Start=953280>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=953510>
	  <P>God! What am I saying?
	<SYNC Start=955430>

	<SYNC Start=962830>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=963070>
	  <P>- I've got something to tell you.<br>- What?
	<SYNC Start=966630>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=966920>

	<SYNC Start=978480>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=978710>
	  <P>So mean!<br>I'm not telling you then.
	<SYNC Start=981680>

	  <P>All right, tell me.
	<SYNC Start=983640>

	  <P>Come on.
	<SYNC Start=985440>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=988880>
	  <P>Guran said ...
	<SYNC Start=990950>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=991190>
	  <P>... I'll put henna on my hands<br>this year.
	<SYNC Start=995560>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=995790>
	  <P>I mean, get married.
	<SYNC Start=998040>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=999120>
	  <P>Wow!
	<SYNC Start=1000890>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1001120>
	  <P>That's great news.
	<SYNC Start=1002970>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1003200>
	  <P>You'll be dancing with joy.<br>Who's the boy?
	<SYNC Start=1006450>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1009760>
	  <P>How would I know?
	<SYNC Start=1011640>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1012120>
	  <P>Guran didn't tell me that.
	<SYNC Start=1014640>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1015730>
	  <P>But one thing is certain:
	<SYNC Start=1017690>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1017920>
	  <P>The house I marry into will have ...
	<SYNC Start=1021370>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1021570>
	  <P>... a neem tree in the courtyard.
	<SYNC Start=1023640>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1023930>
	  <P>A big field beside the house ...
	<SYNC Start=1027440>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1028050>
	  <P>... two cows, a pair of oxen ...
	<SYNC Start=1030880>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1031610>
	  <P>... and three goats.
	<SYNC Start=1033450>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1033810>
	  <P>Guran said my home will be ...
	<SYNC Start=1037120>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1037360>
	  <P>... a little heaven.
	<SYNC Start=1039570>

	  <P>How wonderful!<br>You're really lucky.
	<SYNC Start=1048170>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1048370>
	  <P>Lucky?<br>You call this lucky?
	<SYNC Start=1051770>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1051970>
	  <P>Heaven for a home.<br>What more do you want?
	<SYNC Start=1054450>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1054680>
	  <P>Lord knows what'll become of me.
	<SYNC Start=1057240>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1058120>
	  <P>Tell me one thing, Bhuvan.
	<SYNC Start=1060640>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1060850>
	  <P>- What kind of girl do you like?<br>- Me?
	<SYNC Start=1063880>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1066890>
	  <P>I will only like the girl<br>whom my mother likes.
	<SYNC Start=1070890>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1072250>
	  <P>- Whom Mother likes?<br>- Yes.
	<SYNC Start=1074250>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1074650>
	  <P>- Oh, God!<br>- What happened?
	<SYNC Start=1076650>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1077450>
	  <P>I came to tell you that ...
	<SYNC Start=1080130>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1080640>
	  <P>... Mother wants to see you.
	<SYNC Start=1082440>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1082650>
	  <P>Now you tell me!<br>After all this!
	<SYNC Start=1085050>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1085280>
	  <P>You sit here. I'm going.
	<SYNC Start=1087250>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1088610>
	  <P>Bhuvan, I'm sorry.
	<SYNC Start=1091050>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1108760>
	  <P>Rajahji.
	<SYNC Start=1109760>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1110200>
	  <P>How did your hunt go?
	<SYNC Start=1112240>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1112450>
	  <P>The British are the best<br>when it comes to hunting.
	<SYNC Start=1116090>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1116320>
	  <P>- The British Empire is the best, right?<br>- Absolutely.
	<SYNC Start=1120290>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1120520>
	  <P>- But I'm worried.<br>- About what?
	<SYNC Start=1123450>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1123650>
	  <P>When all the game is finished ...
	<SYNC Start=1125890>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1126120>
	  <P>... whom will your guns target next?
	<SYNC Start=1129240>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1130520>
	  <P>We're fortunate that you came<br>to visit us.
	<SYNC Start=1133280>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1133520>
	  <P>But I don't know the reason.
	<SYNC Start=1135640>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1135880>
	  <P>I've brought a request on behalf<br>of my subjects.
	<SYNC Start=1140040>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1140250>
	  <P>A request?
	<SYNC Start=1141640>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1141850>
	  <P>Morning, Eliza.
	<SYNC Start=1143050>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1143250>
	  <P>Your Highness, I present to you<br>my sister Elizabeth.
	<SYNC Start=1146840>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1147080>
	  <P>She just arrived from London.
	<SYNC Start=1149080>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1149320>
	  <P>Elizabeth, His Highness Puran Singh<br>Chawla of Champaner.
	<SYNC Start=1153160>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1153400>
	  <P>It is my good fortune to meet you.
	<SYNC Start=1156050>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1156250>
	  <P>- Rajahji, she doesn't know Hindi.<br>- Of course.
	<SYNC Start=1159410>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1159610>
	  <P>Charmed to meet you.
	<SYNC Start=1161640>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1162250>
	  <P>Pleased to meet you.
	<SYNC Start=1163850>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1164080>
	  <P>- Sir.<br>- At ease, Smith.
	<SYNC Start=1165930>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1166130>
	  <P>Rajahji.
	<SYNC Start=1166930>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1167130>
	  <P>Elizabeth, meet my deputy,<br>Lt. Patrick Smith.
	<SYNC Start=1170370>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1170600>
	  <P>- How do you do?<br>- Pleased to meet you.
	<SYNC Start=1173250>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1173450>
	  <P>Gentlemen.
	<SYNC Start=1174650>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1177810>
	  <P>Well, Rajahji, I am at your service.
	<SYNC Start=1180330>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1181250>
	  <P>For the last three years,<br>my people haven't worshipped ...
	<SYNC Start=1185040>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1185280>
	  <P>... at the Siddheshwar Temple.
	<SYNC Start=1187280>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1187520>
	  <P>They believe that ...
	<SYNC Start=1189370>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1189600>
	  <P>... worshipping there will end<br>the hardships they faced last year.
	<SYNC Start=1193840>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1194080>
	  <P>- But--<br>- But the temple is in the land ...
	<SYNC Start=1197600>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1197760>
	  <P>... ruled by Rajah Diler Singh,<br>your cousin and your enemy.
	<SYNC Start=1201530>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1201740>
	  <P>And your dear friend.
	<SYNC Start=1205250>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1206740>
	  <P>I'm sure if you speak to Diler Singh,<br>he won't say no.
	<SYNC Start=1210700>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1210930>
	  <P>No, thank you.<br>Hum shakahari hai.
	<SYNC Start=1214290>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1214530>
	  <P>I mean, vegetarian.
	<SYNC Start=1216170>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1218530>
	  <P>What do you think, Captain Russell?<br>Is it possible?
	<SYNC Start=1222290>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1223020>
	  <P>Well, he could be persuaded.
	<SYNC Start=1225260>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1225490>
	  <P>Your work might be done.
	<SYNC Start=1227850>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1229700>
	  <P>But on one condition.
	<SYNC Start=1231580>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1231810>
	  <P>There's one condition.
	<SYNC Start=1233690>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1233930>
	  <P>Condition?
	<SYNC Start=1235780>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1236010>
	  <P>Yes, tell me.
	<SYNC Start=1237570>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1238610>
	  <P>Eat the meat, Your Highness.
	<SYNC Start=1240450>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1245130>
	  <P>You eat this meat<br>and I'll talk to Diler Singh.
	<SYNC Start=1249050>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1250730>
	  <P>As I told you, I'm a vegetarian.
	<SYNC Start=1255060>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1255290>
	  <P>Hum shakahari hai.
	<SYNC Start=1257780>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1257980>
	  <P>Just one piece of meat.
	<SYNC Start=1260460>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1260690>
	  <P>You eat it and consider your job done.
	<SYNC Start=1263730>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1266660>
	  <P>Andrew.
	<SYNC Start=1268260>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1270420>
	  <P>Eat the meat.
	<SYNC Start=1272260>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1277220>
	  <P>How's my eating meat<br>connected to the temple?
	<SYNC Start=1281450>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1281690>
	  <P>It's not connected.
	<SYNC Start=1283180>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1283410>
	  <P>I just want to see you eating meat.
	<SYNC Start=1286900>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1287130>
	  <P>Captain Russell ...
	<SYNC Start=1288690>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1289780>
	  <P>... I cannot betray my religion ...
	<SYNC Start=1292660>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1292890>
	  <P>... in order to do my duty.
	<SYNC Start=1295650>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1298250>
	  <P>I'm sorry.
	<SYNC Start=1299850>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1301490>
	  <P>All right then.<br>You'll have to pay me double tax.
	<SYNC Start=1304980>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1305730>
	  <P>Double "lagaan"?
	<SYNC Start=1306850>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1307420>
	  <P>Look, Rajahji.
	<SYNC Start=1309050>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1309290>
	  <P>Last year, I agreed to cut the tax<br>by half at your request.
	<SYNC Start=1313890>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1314130>
	  <P>And delayed, at that.
	<SYNC Start=1316050>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1316260>
	  <P>You have to clear the arrears<br>this year.
	<SYNC Start=1320260>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1320460>
	  <P>So ...
	<SYNC Start=1321660>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1321860>
	  <P>- ... double "lagaan."<br>- Sir.
	<SYNC Start=1324260>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1326660>
	  <P>But it hasn't rained yet.
	<SYNC Start=1329340>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1329540>
	  <P>The British Raj does not bathe<br>in India's rains, Rajahji.
	<SYNC Start=1333860>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1334090>
	  <P>Rain or no rain,<br>I must maintain this cantonment.
	<SYNC Start=1338730>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1338970>
	  <P>The army costs money.
	<SYNC Start=1341050>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1341290>
	  <P>It has to be paid, fed and clothed ...
	<SYNC Start=1343980>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1344850>
	  <P>... for your protection.
	<SYNC Start=1347260>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1349010>
	  <P>How will the farmers pay?
	<SYNC Start=1351330>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1351620>
	  <P>Come on, Rajahji.<br>It's only double "lagaan."
	<SYNC Start=1355900>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1356210>
	  <P>And moreover ...
	<SYNC Start=1358250>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1358460>
	  <P>... you don't even eat meat.
	<SYNC Start=1361050>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1391180>
	  <P>Hey, Arjan!<br>What's Bagha so thrilled about?
	<SYNC Start=1394300>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1394530>
	  <P>- I don't know.<br>- Must be something special.
	<SYNC Start=1397460>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1397740>
	  <P>Hey, Bagha!<br>What are you beating that drum for?
	<SYNC Start=1402020>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1439710>
	  <P>Clouds!
	<SYNC Start=1441070>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1444660>
	  <P>Dark and dense
	<SYNC Start=1446460>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1452870>
	  <P>Dark and dense<br>Come the swirling clouds
	<SYNC Start=1455910>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1456140>
	  <P>Dark and dense<br>Roar the clouds
	<SYNC Start=1458460>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1458670>
	  <P>The thunder reverberates
	<SYNC Start=1461070>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1461270>
	  <P>How lethally does lightning flash
	<SYNC Start=1463780>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1464020>
	  <P>The clouds make my heart race
	<SYNC Start=1467670>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1467900>
	  <P>The clouds make my heart race
	<SYNC Start=1471260>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1475340>
	  <P>O black cloud<br>Pour down your rain
	<SYNC Start=1480270>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1483430>
	  <P>O black cloud<br>Pour down your rain
	<SYNC Start=1488430>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1491220>

	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1790750>
	  <P>There'll be no rain this year too.
	<SYNC Start=1793480>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1793680>
	  <P>Bloody lunatic!<br>Lunatic!

	  <P>Listen, villagers,<br>to this proclamation!
	<SYNC Start=1819040>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1819250>
	  <P>Orders of Rajah Puran Singh,<br>your liege and master.
	<SYNC Start=1822930>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1823160>
	  <P>This year you shall pay<br>twice the amount ...
	<SYNC Start=1826200>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1826440>
	  <P>... of wheat, rice and maize.
	<SYNC Start=1828720>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1828960>
	  <P>The double "lagaan"<br>will apply to the whole province.
	<SYNC Start=1832320>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1832530>
	  <P>- How can this be possible?<br>- This is tyranny!
	<SYNC Start=1835360>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1838770>
	  <P>Double "lagaan"!
	<SYNC Start=1840650>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1841890>
	  <P>Demon! Why don't you just<br>skin us alive?!
	<SYNC Start=1844850>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1845050>
	  <P>Our plight isn't hidden from the Rajah!<br>Even then, double "lagaan"!
	<SYNC Start=1849490>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1854330>
	  <P>What have we done wrong?<br>Why double "lagaan"?
	<SYNC Start=1857570>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1857800>
	  <P>We didn't pay on time last year.<br>And we paid only half.
	<SYNC Start=1861560>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1861800>
	  <P>"Abba," it was Rajahji who waived it<br>because it didn't rain.
	<SYNC Start=1865840>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1866680>
	  <P>Sweets one year and abuse the next.
	<SYNC Start=1869440>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1869650>
	  <P>We're being punished for it now!
	<SYNC Start=1872240>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1872480>
	  <P>Quiet, Lakha!
	<SYNC Start=1873690>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1873920>
	  <P>I won't hear one word<br>against our Rajahji.
	<SYNC Start=1877040>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1877330>
	  <P>He and his ancestors have protected us.
	<SYNC Start=1880360>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1880600>
	  <P>So? Was that any favour?
	<SYNC Start=1883250>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1883480>
	  <P>It is the duty of a tree to shelter.
	<SYNC Start=1886240>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1886530>
	  <P>All I want to know is ...
	<SYNC Start=1888440>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1888650>
	  <P>... for how long will we<br>fill his coffers?
	<SYNC Start=1891850>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1892080>
	  <P>Try and understand, Arjan.
	<SYNC Start=1893840>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1894080>
	  <P>This demand is the doing<br>of those damn white "sahibs"!
	<SYNC Start=1898850>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1899080>
	  <P>Whether we put it into<br>the right hand or the left ...
	<SYNC Start=1902440>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1902600>
	  <P>... it is still we who pay.
	<SYNC Start=1904810>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1905890>
	  <P>I say we all go to the palace<br>and talk to him.
	<SYNC Start=1910520>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1910680>
	  <P>He's seen these clouds too.
	<SYNC Start=1912650>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1912850>
	  <P>We'll say we cannot pay "lagaan."
	<SYNC Start=1915570>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1915800>
	  <P>Not a single grain.
	<SYNC Start=1917650>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1918920>
	  <P>What if Rajahji refuses<br>even after hearing us?
	<SYNC Start=1923040>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1923920>
	  <P>Then the fingers of my hand<br>will close into a fist.
	<SYNC Start=1927240>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1927480>
	  <P>Meaning? You'll fight?
	<SYNC Start=1929970>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1930200>
	  <P>- If it's necessary, then I will.<br>- Have you lost your mind?
	<SYNC Start=1934240>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1934530>
	  <P>If you offend Rajahji,<br>we'll all be ruined!
	<SYNC Start=1938040>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1938250>
	  <P>Is your life all joy<br>and comfort right now?
	<SYNC Start=1941450>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1941650>
	  <P>I won't let the whole village<br>come to harm!
	<SYNC Start=1944570>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1944800>
	  <P>What should we do?
	<SYNC Start=1946440>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1946920>
	  <P>Sell our homes?<br>Our cattle? Ourselves?
	<SYNC Start=1949570>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1949800>
	  <P>What justice is it<br>to demand double "lagaan"?
	<SYNC Start=1953010>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1965970>
	  <P>Pitch it up a bit.
	<SYNC Start=1968450>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1973450>
	  <P>Running!
	<SYNC Start=1974450>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1975320>
	  <P>Chief, there he is!
	<SYNC Start=1977240>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1980410>
	  <P>Where are you going?
	<SYNC Start=1981850>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1982050>
	  <P>Please. We must meet His Highness.<br>It is most urgent.
	<SYNC Start=1985690>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1985920>
	  <P>But the game is going on.
	<SYNC Start=1987920>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1988130>
	  <P>Sit here. You must wait<br>until the game is over.
	<SYNC Start=1992050>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=1992250>
	  <P>All of you, sit down.
	<SYNC Start=1994650>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2001490>
	  <P>What are they playing?
	<SYNC Start=2003450>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2004540>
	  <P>God knows what these white guys<br>are playing.
	<SYNC Start=2007650>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2010010>
	  <P>It's quite like our game of<br>gilli-danda.
	<SYNC Start=2013050>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2014450>
	  <P>Why are they playing<br>a kid's game then?
	<SYNC Start=2018250>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2020420>
	  <P>Run it! Run it!
	<SYNC Start=2022860>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2024340>
	  <P>How's that?
	<SYNC Start=2025980>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2026210>
	  <P>Yardley!
	<SYNC Start=2027660>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2029410>
	  <P>Any clouds up there?
	<SYNC Start=2031450>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2037900>
	  <P>Great shot!
	<SYNC Start=2039300>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2039530>
	  <P>Wasn't that a wonderful shot?
	<SYNC Start=2042050>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2052660>
	  <P>You are not supposed to<br>touch the ball!
	<SYNC Start=2056060>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2069330>
	  <P>Bloody darkie!<br>Arrest him!
	<SYNC Start=2071650>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2077290>
	  <P>Long live Your Highness!
	<SYNC Start=2079090>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2079500>
	  <P>What are you all doing here?
	<SYNC Start=2081700>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2081900>
	  <P>Forgive us.
	<SYNC Start=2083170>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2083410>
	  <P>We came to see you,<br>not to see their stupid game.
	<SYNC Start=2087010>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2087220>
	  <P>We are desperate here<br>and now he hits Bhura!
	<SYNC Start=2090220>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2090420>
	  <P>- Captain Russell--<br>- I didn't hear what you just said.
	<SYNC Start=2093860>
	  <P>&nbsp;

	  <P>Forgive them.
	<SYNC Start=2095610>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2095820>
	  <P>They've come to me with their problems.
	<SYNC Start=2098570>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2098810>
	  <P>The boy is an innocent anyway.
	<SYNC Start=2100980>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2101540>
	  <P>He's not so innocent.
	<SYNC Start=2103850>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2104330>
	  <P>It was you in the jungle, right?
	<SYNC Start=2107450>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2110660>
	  <P>All right.
	<SYNC Start=2112060>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2112530>
	  <P>We'll decide this after the game.
	<SYNC Start=2115180>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2115410>
	  <P>Leave him.
	<SYNC Start=2116860>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2119300>
	  <P>Come on, chaps.<br>Back to the game.
	<SYNC Start=2121860>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2123010>
	  <P>- We'll talk after the game.<br>- As you wish, Your Highness.
	<SYNC Start=2127170>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2135610>
	  <P>Well done, Smith.<br>Well done.

	  <P>Enjoy the game?<br>It was a good one.
	<SYNC Start=2162650>

	  <P>Long live Your Highness.
	<SYNC Start=2172650>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2174900>
	  <P>All right, Chief.<br>What is the matter?
	<SYNC Start=2178170>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2178410>
	  <P>As you are aware, Your Highness ...
	<SYNC Start=2180820>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2181020>
	  <P>... there have been no rains.
	<SYNC Start=2183460>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2183660>
	  <P>If we can live on ...
	<SYNC Start=2185170>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2186050>
	  <P>... what we have this year,<br>we may be able to get by.
	<SYNC Start=2189460>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2189660>
	  <P>Our liege lord.<br>We've come to make a plea.
	<SYNC Start=2192490>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2192730>
	  <P>Waive our "lagaan"<br>for this year, Lord.
	<SYNC Start=2196570>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2197730>
	  <P>Listen, Chief.
	<SYNC Start=2199290>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2199530>
	  <P>I fully understand<br>what you are all going through.
	<SYNC Start=2203670>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2205300>
	  <P>But my hands are tied as well.
	<SYNC Start=2207660>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2208140>
	  <P>These whites don't even spare<br>their own kin.
	<SYNC Start=2213180>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2216460>
	  <P>You will pay double "lagaan."
	<SYNC Start=2218700>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2218940>
	  <P>- We'll die of hunger.<br>- We'll starve.
	<SYNC Start=2222060>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2222750>
	  <P>- Any problem, Your Highness?<br>- Captain Russell ...
	<SYNC Start=2226060>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2226300>
	  <P>- ... they have come with a petition.<br>- And that is?
	<SYNC Start=2229510>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2229710>
	  <P>They want to be exempted<br>from paying "lagaan."
	<SYNC Start=2232780>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2233020>
	  <P>I told them it's not possible.
	<SYNC Start=2236060>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2236270>
	  <P>But it is possible.
	<SYNC Start=2238670>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2241150>
	  <P>How?
	<SYNC Start=2242670>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2243750>
	  <P>I will tell you.
	<SYNC Start=2245470>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2247950>
	  <P>All right.
	<SYNC Start=2249270>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2250300>
	  <P>I'll cancel the tax.
	<SYNC Start=2252660>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2256020>
	  <P>But there is a condition.
	<SYNC Start=2258260>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2258900>
	  <P>Condition?
	<SYNC Start=2260270>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2260500>
	  <P>What condition, sir?
	<SYNC Start=2262230>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2263380>
	  <P>You.
	<SYNC Start=2264660>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2267220>
	  <P>Come here.
	<SYNC Start=2268220>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2277750>
	  <P>What was that you said<br>about our game?
	<SYNC Start=2280470>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2280700>
	  <P>What did he say?
	<SYNC Start=2282260>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2284230>
	  <P>"A stupid game."
	<SYNC Start=2286910>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2288540>
	  <P>What do you know about this game?
	<SYNC Start=2291470>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2293820>
	  <P>We've played it since we were kids.
	<SYNC Start=2296260>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2296470>
	  <P>We call it "gilli-danda" and ...
	<SYNC Start=2298870>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2299150>
	  <P>- Who knows what you call it?<br>- Cricket!
	<SYNC Start=2302110>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2304660>
	  <P>So you're saying that<br>you can play cricket too?
	<SYNC Start=2308460>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2311870>
	  <P>Yes. It's easy.
	<SYNC Start=2314030>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2317340>
	  <P>All right.<br>I'll cancel the "lagaan."
	<SYNC Start=2321460>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2321940>
	  <P>But you must<br>defeat us in this game.
	<SYNC Start=2325260>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2327300>
	  <P>This is the condition:
	<SYNC Start=2329060>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2329750>
	  <P>You beat us at this game<br>and you won't have to pay "lagaan."
	<SYNC Start=2334590>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2339550>
	  <P>I'm serious.
	<SYNC Start=2341070>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2344100>
	  <P>You beat us in this game ...
	<SYNC Start=2346270>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2346950>
	  <P>... and I'll cancel your tax.
	<SYNC Start=2349460>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2356700>
	  <P>But ...
	<SYNC Start=2358260>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2358500>
	  <P>... if you lose ...
	<SYNC Start=2360910>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2361110>
	  <P>... you will have to pay triple tax.
	<SYNC Start=2364070>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2364300>
	  <P>That is, three times the "lagaan."
	<SYNC Start=2367820>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2368260>
	  <P>All right?<br>What do you think?
	<SYNC Start=2370470>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2371270>
	  <P>Do you accept?
	<SYNC Start=2372630>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2387350>
	  <P>Sir, I think the cat's got his tongue.
	<SYNC Start=2390270>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2391540>
	  <P>Quiet.
	<SYNC Start=2392870>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2394310>
	  <P>All right.<br>I will raise the stakes.
	<SYNC Start=2397870>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2398900>
	  <P>If you defeat us in this game ...
	<SYNC Start=2401470>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2401710>
	  <P>... I'll cancel not only ...
	<SYNC Start=2403880>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2404110>
	  <P>... this year's "lagaan,"<br>but next year's as well.
	<SYNC Start=2407470>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2408870>
	  <P>Agreed?
	<SYNC Start=2410150>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2411710>
	  <P>Bhuvan!<br>Don't you say anything!
	<SYNC Start=2414400>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2414630>
	  <P>- Don't say a word.<br>- Yes. Be silent.
	<SYNC Start=2417880>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2419720>
	  <P>All right.
	<SYNC Start=2421080>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2421510>
	  <P>I'll raise the stakes even higher.
	<SYNC Start=2424480>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2425350>
	  <P>Not just one year.
	<SYNC Start=2427080>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2427310>
	  <P>I'll cancel "lagaan"<br>for the next two years.
	<SYNC Start=2430870>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2431110>
	  <P>That means three years!
	<SYNC Start=2433670>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2434150>
	  <P>And not just for you,<br>but for the whole province.
	<SYNC Start=2438270>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2439720>
	  <P>Now do you accept?
	<SYNC Start=2441480>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2443150>
	  <P>He's digging a pit<br>to bury us in, Bhuvan.
	<SYNC Start=2445950>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2446160>
	  <P>- Chief, you speak up now.<br>- Yes, Chief, speak up.
	<SYNC Start=2449470>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2450280>
	  <P>- Sir--!?<br>- Shut up!
	<SYNC Start=2451760>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2452760>
	  <P>You.
	<SYNC Start=2454080>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2454680>
	  <P>Tell me.
	<SYNC Start=2455680>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2457550>
	  <P>Will you pay double "lagaan"?
	<SYNC Start=2459670>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2460880>
	  <P>Or do you accept the bet?
	<SYNC Start=2462880>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2488750>
	  <P>I accept the bet.
	<SYNC Start=2490870>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2499150>
	  <P>- Did he agree?<br>- Yes, he did.
	<SYNC Start=2502070>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2502480>
	  <P>All right.
	<SYNC Start=2503870>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2504910>
	  <P>So it's decided. The game will be played<br>after three months.
	<SYNC Start=2509950>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2510790>
	  <P>- This will kill us, Your Highness.<br>- We'll die.
	<SYNC Start=2514030>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2514600>
	  <P>This is unfair.
	<SYNC Start=2516670>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2518160>
	  <P>So is life.
	<SYNC Start=2519880>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2545640>
	  <P>No "lagaan" if you win.
	<SYNC Start=2548120>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2548350>
	  <P>But if we lose, we have to pay<br>three times the amount.
	<SYNC Start=2552080>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2552280>
	  <P>And Bhuvan here<br>agreed to this condition!
	<SYNC Start=2555280>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2555510>
	  <P>- What have you done?<br>- From double to triple!
	<SYNC Start=2558790>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2559000>
	  <P>We are ruined!
	<SYNC Start=2560080>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2560310>
	  <P>I told you we could<br>face a calamity, didn't I?
	<SYNC Start=2564870>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2565510>
	  <P>Was there any choice?
	<SYNC Start=2567680>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2567910>
	  <P>I ask you,<br>did we have a choice?
	<SYNC Start=2570120>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2570350>
	  <P>What else could we do?
	<SYNC Start=2572270>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2572560>
	  <P>Isn't double "lagaan" unjust?
	<SYNC Start=2575070>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2575640>
	  <P>Are we strong enough to pay it?<br>Tell me, can anyone here pay it?
	<SYNC Start=2580080>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2580800>
	  <P>This isn't a calamity.<br>It's an opportunity.
	<SYNC Start=2583680>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2583910>
	  <P>This is not bravado.
	<SYNC Start=2586080>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2586280>
	  <P>You have to get burnt<br>to save your home from fire.
	<SYNC Start=2590280>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2591830>
	  <P>I know.
	<SYNC Start=2593280>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2593560>
	  <P>I know we are weak.
	<SYNC Start=2595720>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2595950>
	  <P>But this way we have hope.
	<SYNC Start=2598070>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2598510>
	  <P>And I want to turn<br>this hope into reality.
	<SYNC Start=2602080>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2602450>
	  <P>This game is for<br>our fields and harvest.
	<SYNC Start=2605210>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2605440>
	  <P>Have you forgotten? If we win,<br>we'll be happy for three years.
	<SYNC Start=2610560>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2613360>
	  <P>Just think.
	<SYNC Start=2615200>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2615440>
	  <P>No "lagaan" for three years.
	<SYNC Start=2618090>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2618400>
	  <P>You know what that means?
	<SYNC Start=2620480>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2620920>
	  <P>It means our grain will be ours.<br>Only ours.
	<SYNC Start=2623960>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2624200>
	  <P>Not a grain to be given.
	<SYNC Start=2626480>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2626720>
	  <P>The welfare of our children,<br>our entire village, is in this.
	<SYNC Start=2631690>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2631920>
	  <P>Our sweat will run<br>as blood in our veins.
	<SYNC Start=2635890>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2638330>
	  <P>Marvellous!
	<SYNC Start=2640090>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2640650>
	  <P>Such small eyes<br>dreaming such big dreams.
	<SYNC Start=2643610>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2643840>
	  <P>Yes, Arjan, I have a dream.
	<SYNC Start=2647090>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2647450>
	  <P>And only those who dream<br>can make them come true.
	<SYNC Start=2651090>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2651560>
	  <P>lsar "Kaka," three months is time enough.
	<SYNC Start=2654840>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2655280>
	  <P>We can defeat them.
	<SYNC Start=2657080>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2657290>
	  <P>A whole year of hitting with a stick<br>won't teach you ...
	<SYNC Start=2661080>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2661290>
	  <P>... this game!
	<SYNC Start=2662890>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2663170>
	  <P>I know this isn't easy, Lakha.
	<SYNC Start=2665480>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2665690>
	  <P>But, Chief,<br>it's not impossible either.
	<SYNC Start=2668890>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2669360>
	  <P>I need your support.
	<SYNC Start=2670850>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2671050>
	  <P>Nobody in this village<br>will support you in this madness!
	<SYNC Start=2674770>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2674970>
	  <P>- But Ismail--<br>- Enough.
	<SYNC Start=2676760>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2677520>
	  <P>We've only one hope.
	<SYNC Start=2678890>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2679690>
	  <P>We'll all go to Rajahji once again<br>and beg him to save us.
	<SYNC Start=2684880>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2710960>
	  <P>What are you thinking, Mother?
	<SYNC Start=2712920>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2714960>
	  <P>About what happened today, son.
	<SYNC Start=2718370>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2719370>
	  <P>I swear on you, Mother!<br>I did what was right.
	<SYNC Start=2723330>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2725770>
	  <P>I feel rage when we pay "lagaan"<br>to the Rajah.
	<SYNC Start=2729080>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2729650>
	  <P>And he gives it<br>to those filthy whites.
	<SYNC Start=2732890>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2734090>
	  <P>You tell me, Mother.
	<SYNC Start=2735490>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2735800>
	  <P>Who ploughs the earth<br>to sow the seeds? We do.
	<SYNC Start=2739490>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2739690>
	  <P>Who waters it?<br>We do.
	<SYNC Start=2741530>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2741760>
	  <P>So why should we fill their coffers?
	<SYNC Start=2744250>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2748690>
	  <P>The white "sahib" said that "lagaan"<br>may be cancelled for three years.
	<SYNC Start=2753280>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2753690>
	  <P>How could I remain silent, Mother?
	<SYNC Start=2756090>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2757210>
	  <P>You tell me.
	<SYNC Start=2758690>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2759440>
	  <P>Should I have stayed silent?
	<SYNC Start=2761610>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2764360>
	  <P>What are you looking at, Mother?
	<SYNC Start=2767250>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2770280>
	  <P>You talk just like your father.
	<SYNC Start=2773690>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2775050>
	  <P>He was just as spirited.<br>Always spoke the truth.
	<SYNC Start=2779490>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2786970>
	  <P>Go and sleep now.
	<SYNC Start=2789280>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2790040>
	  <P>Don't let this burden you.
	<SYNC Start=2792490>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2820500>
	  <P>Gauri?<br>What are you doing here?
	<SYNC Start=2823420>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2825380>
	  <P>I came to see you.
	<SYNC Start=2828100>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2829770>
	  <P>To tell you ...
	<SYNC Start=2832290>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2832500>
	  <P>... that I am with you.
	<SYNC Start=2834700>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2839140>
	  <P>I have faith ...
	<SYNC Start=2840700>

	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2950810>
	  <P>It's not at all difficult, Tipu.
	<SYNC Start=2953530>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2954010>
	  <P>They play it wearing pants<br>and call it "kirkut."
	<SYNC Start=2957180>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2957410>
	  <P>We wear loincloths and call it<br>"gilli-danda." Get it?
	<SYNC Start=2961140>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2962770>
	  <P>Our fathers and grandfathers<br>played "gilli-danda."

	<SYNC Start=2994660>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=2994890>
	  <P>This game is just like "gilli-danda."

	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3006150>
	  <P>Well done, Tipu.<br>Isn't it easy?
	<SYNC Start=3009350>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3010220>

	  <P>Hey, Gauri!
	<SYNC Start=3042750>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3043220>
	  <P>What are you doing?<br>Go heat the water.
	<SYNC Start=3046430>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3054580>
	  <P>Here, Tipu.
	<SYNC Start=3055860>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3056340>
	  <P>Now watch me this time.<br>It's very easy.
	<SYNC Start=3059380>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3070780>
	  <P>Damn!<br>The stick slipped.
	<SYNC Start=3072740>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3075020>
	  <P>My hands are sweaty.
	<SYNC Start=3077340>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3081630>
	  <P>This should do the trick.
	<SYNC Start=3083310>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3085420>
	  <P>Okay, Tipu, throw.
	<SYNC Start=3086660>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3088390>
	  <P>And don't feel bad.
	<SYNC Start=3089940>
	  <P>&nbsp;

	<SYNC Start=3135660>
	  <P>Wow!
	<SYNC Start=3136660>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3148140>
	  <P>Hey, Bagha!<br>Throw the ball.
	<SYNC Start=3150740>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3174140>
	  <P>- May I say something, Father?<br>- What?
	<SYNC Start=3177260>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3177500>
	  <P>I feel Bhuvan is doing<br>the right thing.
	<SYNC Start=3181150>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3181830>
	  <P>All right.<br>Go see if the water's boiling.
	<SYNC Start=3184750>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3207550>
	  <P>That's it, Bagha.<br>Hit it hard.
	<SYNC Start=3210270>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3213830>
	  <P>Well done, Bagha!
	<SYNC Start=3215350>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3233310>
	  <P>Bhuvan, like Bagha,<br>I am also with you.
	<SYNC Start=3236950>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3277840>
	  <P>Who are they, Father?
	<SYNC Start=3279360>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3279590>
	  <P>Ramprasad and Namdeo.<br>Chiefs of Tanipura and Bhind.
	<SYNC Start=3283040>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3290040>
	  <P>But with so many people ...
	<SYNC Start=3292550>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3296960>
	  <P>- Who is Bhuvan?<br>- Bhuvan?
	<SYNC Start=3299760>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3299960>
	  <P>There he is.
	<SYNC Start=3301320>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3304320>
	  <P>There he is!
	<SYNC Start=3305950>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3314990>
	  <P>Stop, Ramprasad!
	<SYNC Start=3317160>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3317520>
	  <P>- Respect the code of honour!<br>- I've no quarrel with your village.
	<SYNC Start=3322150>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3322390>
	  <P>We've come to teach Bhuvan a lesson!
	<SYNC Start=3324950>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3326400>
	  <P>Why should we suffer<br>for what he's done?
	<SYNC Start=3329160>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3329360>
	  <P>You bigmouth!<br>Who are you to decide for us?
	<SYNC Start=3332430>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3332640>
	  <P>- I've done what is good for us.<br>- To hell with your good!
	<SYNC Start=3336320>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3336520>
	  <P>You must beg for forgiveness<br>from the "sahib"!
	<SYNC Start=3339350>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3339590>
	  <P>As for your game,<br>to hell with that!
	<SYNC Start=3342240>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3342440>
	  <P>No? You are asking for trouble!
	<SYNC Start=3345320>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3345520>
	  <P>Be calm, Ramprasad!<br>It'll be as you say.
	<SYNC Start=3348160>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3348390>
	  <P>- But, Chief--<br>- Enough!
	<SYNC Start=3350070>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3350280>
	  <P>No more buts!
	<SYNC Start=3352350>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3355600>
	  <P>We must go to our Rajahji.
	<SYNC Start=3357760>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3362040>
	  <P>The issue is not about the temple,<br>"lagaan" or the game.
	<SYNC Start=3366960>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3367360>
	  <P>But of British honour.
	<SYNC Start=3369560>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3370800>
	  <P>And Captain Russell's ego.
	<SYNC Start=3374680>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3374880>
	  <P>Talk to the white "sahib" once more,<br>Your Highness.
	<SYNC Start=3378390>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3378630>
	  <P>Forgive him, Your Highness.<br>He is nave.
	<SYNC Start=3381280>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3381510>
	  <P>- He got carried away.<br>- It doesn't matter what he is.
	<SYNC Start=3385880>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3386110>
	  <P>He has challenged the British<br>on your behalf.
	<SYNC Start=3389150>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3389390>
	  <P>He is ready to beg for forgiveness.<br>All of us are.
	<SYNC Start=3393950>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3394680>
	  <P>I'll agree to 100 whiplashes.
	<SYNC Start=3396960>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3397640>
	  <P>- But I won't beg for forgiveness.<br>- What?!
	<SYNC Start=3400320>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3400520>
	  <P>It's too late for forgiving.
	<SYNC Start=3402840>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3403080>
	  <P>You must pay for what you have done.
	<SYNC Start=3405770>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3407250>
	  <P>So what shall we do then?
	<SYNC Start=3409210>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3411650>
	  <P>I suggest you learn their game.
	<SYNC Start=3414170>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3422730>
	  <P>Why are all these other guys<br>standing in the field?
	<SYNC Start=3426210>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3426440>
	  <P>Like in "gilli-danda,"<br>to catch the "gilli." I mean, the ball.
	<SYNC Start=3431410>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3432610>
	  <P>How's that?!
	<SYNC Start=3433690>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3435200>
	  <P>That is out, sir.
	<SYNC Start=3436960>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3440610>
	  <P>Why does he point his finger<br>at the sky?
	<SYNC Start=3443450>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3443680>
	  <P>I'm trying to understand.
	<SYNC Start=3445600>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3445810>
	  <P>He's thinking of his mother.<br>She's sitting up there, right?
	<SYNC Start=3449770>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3452280>
	  <P>Bowl it on the offside!
	<SYNC Start=3454560>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3479770>
	  <P>Excuse me.<br>I'll just take a walk.
	<SYNC Start=3482570>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3494680>
	  <P>Quiet.
	<SYNC Start=3495960>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3499890>
	  <P>This bug's after me.
	<SYNC Start=3501330>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3502050>
	  <P>Quiet!
	<SYNC Start=3503570>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3509120>
	  <P>Quiet. The white lady is coming here.
	<SYNC Start=3512570>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3523000>
	  <P>Damn, it's got in!
	<SYNC Start=3524960>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3526570>
	  <P>Oh, no! It'll kill me!
	<SYNC Start=3529160>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3535010>
	  <P>Miss? What happened?<br>These darkies bothering you?
	<SYNC Start=3538410>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3538610>
	  <P>It's okay. They're farmers.<br>I know them.
	<SYNC Start=3541570>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3541770>
	  <P>Thank you.<br>Carry on your game.
	<SYNC Start=3544170>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3550570>
	  <P>I know what you were doing.
	<SYNC Start=3552570>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3552770>
	  <P>You were trying to learn the game.
	<SYNC Start=3555170>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3555920>
	  <P>No, "memsahib." We're only<br>trying to learn the game.
	<SYNC Start=3559370>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3560970>
	  <P>Oh, I thought you were<br>trying to learn the game.
	<SYNC Start=3564760>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3565200>
	  <P>What's she saying, Bhuvan "Bhaiyya"?
	<SYNC Start=3567890>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3568120>
	  <P>I think she's telling us to go.
	<SYNC Start=3571160>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3571530>
	  <P>- All right, we're going.<br>- No.
	<SYNC Start=3573840>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3574410>
	  <P>Wait.
	<SYNC Start=3575770>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3578010>
	  <P>Ram Singh!
	<SYNC Start=3579560>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3584450>
	  <P>Yes, "memsahib."<br>What can I do?
	<SYNC Start=3586410>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3586640>
	  <P>Tell them that I would like<br>to help them learn the game.
	<SYNC Start=3590370>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3590570>
	  <P>Yes, "memsahib."
	<SYNC Start=3591570>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3591800>
	  <P>"Memsahib" says she'll help you<br>understand--
	<SYNC Start=3594970>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3596640>
	  <P>"Memsahib," just a minute.
	<SYNC Start=3598560>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3602460>
	  <P>If Russell "sahib--"?<br>Russell "sahib" will get angry.
	<SYNC Start=3605900>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3606130>
	  <P>- Ram Singh, can I trust you?<br>- Of course, "memsahib."
	<SYNC Start=3609890>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3610100>
	  <P>No one should know about this.
	<SYNC Start=3612780>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3614260>
	  <P>All right, "memsahib."
	<SYNC Start=3616020>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3616250>
	  <P>No one will know.
	<SYNC Start=3618370>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3620860>
	  <P>"Memsahib" says she wants to help you<br>understand the game.
	<SYNC Start=3625220>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3625450>
	  <P>Really?
	<SYNC Start=3626570>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3628090>
	  <P>But why?<br>After all, she's white too.
	<SYNC Start=3631170>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3631740>
	  <P>The man wants to know ...
	<SYNC Start=3633900>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3634130>
	  <P>... why you want to do this<br>as you too are British.
	<SYNC Start=3637580>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3639180>
	  <P>Tell him I know what happened is unfair<br>and I want to ...
	<SYNC Start=3643100>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3643330>
	  <P>... give them a fair chance.
	<SYNC Start=3645410>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3645650>
	  <P>"Memsahib" knows injustice<br>has been done.
	<SYNC Start=3648580>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3648780>
	  <P>That's why she wants to give you<br>an equal chance.
	<SYNC Start=3652780>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3653650>
	  <P>We are pleased to accept.<br>Thank you.
	<SYNC Start=3656490>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3656730>
	  <P>He's happy to have your help<br>and thanks you.
	<SYNC Start=3659570>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3659730>
	  <P>- Good.<br>- Wonderful!
	<SYNC Start=3662380>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3663380>
	  <P>Tell him I'll meet him tomorrow.
	<SYNC Start=3665690>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3665930>
	  <P>Same time, but not here.
	<SYNC Start=3669050>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3669290>
	  <P>And not in their village.
	<SYNC Start=3671170>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3671410>
	  <P>Some other place?
	<SYNC Start=3673170>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3673410>
	  <P>She'll see you tomorrow,<br>same time. But not here.

	<SYNC Start=3680050>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=3680890>

	<SYNC Start=4424490>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4426980>
	  <P>- What do you know about the game?<br>- What?
	<SYNC Start=4429940>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4430170>
	  <P>"Memsahib" wants to know<br>what you know about the game.
	<SYNC Start=4433730>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4433970>
	  <P>Lots!
	<SYNC Start=4435300>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4435580>
	  <P>There are six sticks.<br>Three on either side.
	<SYNC Start=4438930>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4439170>
	  <P>Two fellows stand with planks<br>before the sticks.
	<SYNC Start=4442490>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4442700>
	  <P>One runs near the sticks<br>and throws a ball.
	<SYNC Start=4445900>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4446100>
	  <P>The other hits the ball<br>with his plank.
	<SYNC Start=4448610>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4448850>
	  <P>And everyone runs<br>here and there.
	<SYNC Start=4451130>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4451370>
	  <P>One of them grabs the ball<br>and gives it back.
	<SYNC Start=4454690>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4454900>
	  <P>He throws the ball again<br>at the guy who twirls the plank.
	<SYNC Start=4458900>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4459100>
	  <P>This goes on all day.
	<SYNC Start=4461010>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4461250>
	  <P>Throw the ball, twirl the plank.<br>Throw and twirl. Right?
	<SYNC Start=4465090>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4465530>
	  <P>"Memsahib," I can't translate all that.
	<SYNC Start=4468290>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4468700>
	  <P>No need, Ram Singh.
	<SYNC Start=4470610>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4470850>
	  <P>I understood most of that.
	<SYNC Start=4472890>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4473730>
	  <P>He knows nothing.
	<SYNC Start=4475490>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4477010>
	  <P>This is what a cricket field looks like.
	<SYNC Start=4480330>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4480570>
	  <P>- This is the field.<br>- This is a cricket pitch.
	<SYNC Start=4483690>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4483900>
	  <P>The game is played on this strip.
	<SYNC Start=4486730>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4486970>
	  <P>There are three main aspects:<br>batting, bowling and fielding.
	<SYNC Start=4491740>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4491970>
	  <P>There are three aspects:<br>Wielding the bat ...
	<SYNC Start=4495220>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4495420>
	  <P>... throwing the ball<br>and guarding the field.
	<SYNC Start=4498820>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4499050>
	  <P>Even our great-uncles won't<br>understand this.
	<SYNC Start=4502090>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4502780>
	  <P>What did he say?
	<SYNC Start=4504260>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4504460>
	  <P>This language, even his<br>ancestors won't understand.
	<SYNC Start=4508100>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4509970>
	  <P>Better make it simpler.
	<SYNC Start=4511940>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4512140>
	  <P>Cricket is played by two teams,<br>say yours and the English.
	<SYNC Start=4516730>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4516970>
	  <P>Each team has 11 players.
	<SYNC Start=4519490>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4519730>
	  <P>Five batters, five bowlers<br>and one wicketkeeper.
	<SYNC Start=4523970>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4553580>
	  <P>Gauri.
	<SYNC Start=4554900>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4555530>
	  <P>Gauri.
	<SYNC Start=4557090>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4557500>
	  <P>Yes?
	<SYNC Start=4558530>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4558740>
	  <P>What happened?
	<SYNC Start=4560490>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4561580>
	  <P>What happened?
	<SYNC Start=4563300>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4564570>
	  <P>- Nothing.<br>- Memsahib ...
	<SYNC Start=4567050>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4567260>
	  <P>... I think we should leave.<br>It's getting late.
	<SYNC Start=4570290>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4570530>
	  <P>This is enough for today.
	<SYNC Start=4573130>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4576250>
	  <P>- We'll begin with a little prayer.<br>- Hari Om.
	<SYNC Start=4579290>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4579500>
	  <P>Catch, Bagha.
	<SYNC Start=4581100>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4583500>
	  <P>Everyone, try catching the ball.<br>Don't let it drop.
	<SYNC Start=4587340>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4587540>
	  <P>Bhuvan, the white lady said<br>there must be 11 in a team.
	<SYNC Start=4592090>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4592300>
	  <P>We are only five.
	<SYNC Start=4593970>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4594210>
	  <P>Why five?<br>I'm here too.
	<SYNC Start=4596090>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4596330>
	  <P>Whatever the white lady can do,<br>so can I.
	<SYNC Start=4599540>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4599740>
	  <P>All right, Gauri.<br>We're six, not five.
	<SYNC Start=4603300>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4603620>
	  <P>You are doing it for your village,<br>I'm sure the others will too.
	<SYNC Start=4608820>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4609060>
	  <P>- If not, we'll drag them in anyway.<br>- Goli!
	<SYNC Start=4611820>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4612460>
	  <P>Catch the ball!
	<SYNC Start=4613910>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4633950>
	  <P>- Who threw this ball?<br>- Goli "Chacha" did?
	<SYNC Start=4637110>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4639070>
	  <P>Goli, you jackass!
	<SYNC Start=4640910>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4641190>
	  <P>I'm gonna get you today!
	<SYNC Start=4643100>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4643830>
	  <P>There they go again.
	<SYNC Start=4645620>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4645910>
	  <P>I'll crack you open like an egg!
	<SYNC Start=4648500>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4649590>
	  <P>Will you two stop your squabbling?
	<SYNC Start=4652660>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4653670>
	  <P>- lsar "Kaka," don't interfere!<br>- Stop it, you fools.
	<SYNC Start=4658110>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4664510>
	  <P>Gauri ...
	<SYNC Start=4665710>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4665990>
	  <P>... our sixth player.
	<SYNC Start=4668100>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4668340>
	  <P>Bhura!
	<SYNC Start=4669550>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4671710>
	  <P>Wow!
	<SYNC Start=4672710>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4673660>
	  <P>Did you see how a ball is caught,<br>lsar "Kaka"?
	<SYNC Start=4676700>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4676910>
	  <P>Amazing!<br>Like a bird diving for fish.
	<SYNC Start=4680070>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4680270>
	  <P>- Oh, so that's how it's done?<br>- Of course!
	<SYNC Start=4683780>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4683990>
	  <P>Bhura, show it to them once more.
	<SYNC Start=4686500>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4686740>
	  <P>Especially to Goli here.<br>He just doesn't know how to catch.
	<SYNC Start=4691340>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4691550>
	  <P>Everybody!<br>Go there and watch carefully.
	<SYNC Start=4694620>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4694860>
	  <P>Come on, Goli.
	<SYNC Start=4696310>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4696740>
	  <P>Ready, Bhura?
	<SYNC Start=4698110>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4700460>
	  <P>Watch carefully.
	<SYNC Start=4701780>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4702910>
	  <P>You see that?!
	<SYNC Start=4703940>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4704180>
	  <P>Brilliant, Bhura.<br>That was something.
	<SYNC Start=4707630>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4707830>
	  <P>But where did you learn that?
	<SYNC Start=4710270>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4710470>
	  <P>I'll tell you.
	<SYNC Start=4711590>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4711790>
	  <P>A ball travels in a straight line.<br>But hens run in a zigzag!
	<SYNC Start=4716630>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4716860>
	  <P>To catch hens,<br>you've got to be quick.
	<SYNC Start=4719860>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4720070>
	  <P>Like Bhura.
	<SYNC Start=4721550>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4721780>
	  <P>Bhura will teach us now.<br>Won't you?
	<SYNC Start=4724900>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4725140>
	  <P>I'll teach you, but ...
	<SYNC Start=4727830>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4728060>
	  <P>But what?
	<SYNC Start=4729510>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4731990>
	  <P>What about my hens?
	<SYNC Start=4733900>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4734710>
	  <P>Bhura, these hens of yours<br>are a real pain!
	<SYNC Start=4739030>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4767030>
	  <P>At ease, captain.
	<SYNC Start=4768940>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4769180>
	  <P>You know Major Cotton.<br>That is Major Warren.
	<SYNC Start=4773150>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4774420>
	  <P>Take a seat.
	<SYNC Start=4775940>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4780350>
	  <P>Now ...
	<SYNC Start=4781350>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4781580>
	  <P>... what is this we hear ...
	<SYNC Start=4783550>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4783780>
	  <P>... that you have agreed to cancel<br>the tax of the farmers ...
	<SYNC Start=4788270>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4788500>
	  <P>... if they beat you<br>in a game of cricket?
	<SYNC Start=4791300>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4791510>
	  <P>Is this true?
	<SYNC Start=4792660>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4793700>
	  <P>Yes, Colonel Boyer. It is.
	<SYNC Start=4795980>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4796190>
	  <P>What are you here for?<br>To play games?
	<SYNC Start=4799350>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4799580>
	  <P>Let me remind you that you are<br>working for Her Majesty, the Queen.
	<SYNC Start=4804200>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4804430>
	  <P>Your job is to ensure<br>the smooth running of your province.
	<SYNC Start=4808360>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4808560>
	  <P>Pardon me.<br>But that's what I'm doing.
	<SYNC Start=4811040>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4811270>
	  <P>We'll be the judge of that, Russell.
	<SYNC Start=4814160>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4814440>
	  <P>We also understand that<br>if you lose this "match" ...
	<SYNC Start=4818360>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4818560>
	  <P>... you will cancel their taxes<br>for three years.
	<SYNC Start=4822000>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4822230>
	  <P>Not just Champaner,<br>but the entire province.
	<SYNC Start=4825880>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4826800>
	  <P>- But they won't win.<br>- You're missing the whole point.
	<SYNC Start=4830560>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4830790>
	  <P>Do you realise we could have<br>a situation where there will be ...
	<SYNC Start=4835280>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4835510>
	  <P>... cricket matches all over<br>the subcontinent ...
	<SYNC Start=4838960>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4839190>
	  <P>... to cancel the tax?
	<SYNC Start=4840680>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4840910>
	  <P>But there is one thing.<br>If they lose, which they will ...
	<SYNC Start=4844950>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4846750>
	  <P>... they will have to pay<br>three times the tax.
	<SYNC Start=4849710>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4849920>
	  <P>Oh, this is ridiculous!
	<SYNC Start=4851590>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4851830>
	  <P>He's making the government<br>into a bookie ...
	<SYNC Start=4855000>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4855230>
	  <P>... with whom he can<br>place his wagers.
	<SYNC Start=4858160>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4858440>
	  <P>What would you have us do next?<br>Race horses?
	<SYNC Start=4861550>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4861760>
	  <P>This is the most preposterous idea!
	<SYNC Start=4864160>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4864390>
	  <P>The British Empire<br>cannot function ...
	<SYNC Start=4866950>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4867160>
	  <P>... according to your<br>whims and fancies.
	<SYNC Start=4869710>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4869920>
	  <P>Now jolly well understand this:
	<SYNC Start=4872360>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4873630>
	  <P>If you win, you'll have had<br>a narrow escape.
	<SYNC Start=4876560>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4876790>
	  <P>But if you lose, you will pay<br>the taxes for Champaner ...
	<SYNC Start=4880790>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4881030>
	  <P>... and the entire province yourself.
	<SYNC Start=4884110>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4884320>
	  <P>Then you'll be sent to Central Africa.<br>Is that clear?
	<SYNC Start=4888110>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4889150>
	  <P>Yes, sir.
	<SYNC Start=4890150>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4892030>
	  <P>That will be all.<br>You may go.
	<SYNC Start=4894350>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4932630>
	  <P>You're supposed to salute<br>when a superior officer passes!
	<SYNC Start=4937390>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4937630>
	  <P>- I did, sir.<br>- I didn't see it.
	<SYNC Start=4940560>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4942590>
	  <P>That's better.
	<SYNC Start=4943830>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4944040>
	  <P>- Your meeting did not go well.<br>- Damn right, it didn't.
	<SYNC Start=4947550>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4947760>
	  <P>The old hats will teach me<br>how to run the show.
	<SYNC Start=4951000>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4951230>
	  <P>They've lost their sense of adventure.
	<SYNC Start=4953960>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4954160>
	  <P>What's wrong with some fun<br>along with the "lagaan"?
	<SYNC Start=4956990>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4957230>
	  <P>- Is the match cancelled, sir?<br>- No!
	<SYNC Start=4959830>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4963840>
	  <P>How dare you hurt my horse?
	<SYNC Start=4966350>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4968910>
	  <P>Hurt my horse, will you?<br>I'll destroy you people!
	<SYNC Start=4972600>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4972830>
	  <P>I'll take so much "lagaan ..."
	<SYNC Start=4975480>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4975710>
	  <P>... you won't have a rag<br>on your backs.
	<SYNC Start=4978750>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4982760>
	  <P>You bloody slaves<br>will remain crushed ...
	<SYNC Start=4985680>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=4985910>
	  <P>... under our boots!
	<SYNC Start=4988160>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5002430>
	  <P>However thick the sole<br>may be, "sahib ..."
	<SYNC Start=5005600>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5005840>
	  <P>... it wears out.<br>Then the nails begin to prick.

	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5013290>
	  <P>Yes, sir?
	<SYNC Start=5014410>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5014640>
	  <P>- Get him out before I kill him.<br>- Yes.
	<SYNC Start=5018000>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5019370>
	  <P>Quick.
	<SYNC Start=5020570>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5046570>
	  <P>Arjan, what happened?
	<SYNC Start=5048200>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5048440>
	  <P>Bhuvan, I've been blind<br>and stupid.
	<SYNC Start=5052240>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5053250>
	  <P>I am with you now.
	<SYNC Start=5055210>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5055440>
	  <P>Tell me, how can I help?
	<SYNC Start=5057560>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5057770>
	  <P>That's great. We're coming together<br>to form a fist.
	<SYNC Start=5061960>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5069290>
	  <P>No, no, Arjan.<br>Not like that.
	<SYNC Start=5071770>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5085840>
	  <P>Lakha, Goli was telling the truth.
	<SYNC Start=5088880>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5089120>
	  <P>- About what?<br>- The white lady.
	<SYNC Start=5091770>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5092600>
	  <P>So?
	<SYNC Start=5093760>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5099130>
	  <P>We were wrong, Lakha.
	<SYNC Start=5101970>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5102200>
	  <P>But we can still make it right.<br>We must support Bhuvan.
	<SYNC Start=5106760>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5107600>
	  <P>What did you say?<br>Have you gone crazy?
	<SYNC Start=5110200>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5110440>
	  <P>Try to understand.
	<SYNC Start=5112760>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5112970>
	  <P>Look.
	<SYNC Start=5113970>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5114400>
	  <P>Look!
	<SYNC Start=5115490>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5115720>
	  <P>An English girl ...
	<SYNC Start=5117570>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5117800>
	  <P>... is helping us<br>save our bodies and souls.
	<SYNC Start=5121080>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5121290>
	  <P>And we sit sulking?
	<SYNC Start=5124210>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5124440>
	  <P>Shame on us!
	<SYNC Start=5126760>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5129320>
	  <P>It is Allah's command.<br>We must be with him.
	<SYNC Start=5133920>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5134530>
	  <P>Come with me. Come!
	<SYNC Start=5136010>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5136610>
	  <P>Ismail ...
	<SYNC Start=5137970>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5138280>
	  <P>... have you gone senile?<br>Then get yourself a crutch ...
	<SYNC Start=5141800>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5141960>
	  <P>... and a shroud too.
	<SYNC Start=5144170>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5146760>
	  <P>This Bhuvan of yours<br>will never succeed.
	<SYNC Start=5149760>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5153410>
	  <P>Ismail ...
	<SYNC Start=5154770>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5155450>
	  <P>... he'll never take you<br>into his team.
	<SYNC Start=5158370>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5160040>
	  <P>Now catch this!
	<SYNC Start=5161560>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5166720>
	  <P>Bhuvan ...
	<SYNC Start=5167960>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5169290>
	  <P>... it's not just your honour,<br>but that of the whole village.
	<SYNC Start=5173170>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5173640>
	  <P>I'm ashamed of all the things<br>I said the other day.
	<SYNC Start=5178360>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5178600>
	  <P>I swear by God ...
	<SYNC Start=5180000>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5180240>
	  <P>... I am with you.<br>It's the word of a man of prayer.
	<SYNC Start=5184400>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5184610>
	  <P>What a beautiful thing to say!<br>He has raised our spirits.
	<SYNC Start=5188720>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5188930>
	  <P>Who can stop us now?
	<SYNC Start=5190960>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5205060>
	  <P>With a procession<br>Of elephants and horses
	<SYNC Start=5207780>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5208010>
	  <P>Raise a cry of victory<br>To Lord Krishna
	<SYNC Start=5211180>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5227220>
	  <P>What are you looking at, "memsahib"?
	<SYNC Start=5229460>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5229610>
	  <P>These statues.<br>Whose images are those?
	<SYNC Start=5233580>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5233810>
	  <P>This is the temple of Radha<br>and Krishna. These are their idols.
	<SYNC Start=5238580>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5238810>
	  <P>Today is Krishna's birthday,<br>so the idols are decorated.
	<SYNC Start=5242500>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5243180>
	  <P>It's very beautiful.
	<SYNC Start=5245180>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5245410>
	  <P>Yes.
	<SYNC Start=5246410>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5246650>
	  <P>Were they husband and wife?
	<SYNC Start=5249010>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5249250>
	  <P>Oh, no, "memsahib."
	<SYNC Start=5250620>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5250850>
	  <P>Krishna was married to Rukmini<br>and Radha to Anay.
	<SYNC Start=5255010>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5255250>
	  <P>But the deep love they had<br>for each other set an ideal.
	<SYNC Start=5260370>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5260980>
	  <P>It's like ...
	<SYNC Start=5262650>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5262890>
	  <P>... a dewdrop on a lotus leaf.
	<SYNC Start=5266170>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5266810>
	  <P>Neither united nor separated.
	<SYNC Start=5269810>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5270450>
	  <P>They've been worshipped together<br>for eons.
	<SYNC Start=5273380>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5283220>
	  <P>- Pujariji?<br>- Oh, yes, Gauri.
	<SYNC Start=5286180>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5301980>
	  <P>Let's go.
	<SYNC Start=5303180>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5321650>
	  <P>If Krishna were to meet<br>A lovelorn nymph in the grove
	<SYNC Start=5326010>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5326250>
	  <P>And then smile and talk<br>Or even tease her
	<SYNC Start=5330290>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5330500>
	  <P>How can Radha be not jealous?
	<SYNC Start=5332410>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5332620>
	  <P>How can Radha be not jealous?
	<SYNC Start=5335210>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5335450>
	  <P>Her body and heart<br>Are on fire
	<SYNC Start=5337450>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5346020>
	  <P>Even if Krishna were to meet<br>A lovelorn nymph in the grove
	<SYNC Start=5350380>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5350850>
	  <P>It's only Radha's love<br>That blooms in his heart
	<SYNC Start=5354890>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5355180>
	  <P>Then why is Radha jealous?
	<SYNC Start=5357380>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5359970>
	  <P>With no rhyme or reason
	<SYNC Start=5362170>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5362380>
	  <P>Why is Radha jealous?
	<SYNC Start=5364860>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5392250>
	  <P>The nymphs are but stars<br>And Radha is the moon
	<SYNC Start=5396810>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5397050>
	  <P>Why is her faith then<br>So half-hearted?
	<SYNC Start=5401130>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5413390>
	  <P>Faithless Krishna is forever<br>Looking hither and thither
	<SYNC Start=5417460>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5418340>
	  <P>Then how can poor Radha<br>Believe in herself?
	<SYNC Start=5422380>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5422620>
	  <P>Nymphs come and go<br>But Radha is the queen of his heart
	<SYNC Start=5427070>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5431910>
	  <P>Dawn and dusk<br>By the Jamuna's banks
	<SYNC Start=5434190>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5434420>
	  <P>It's only Radha<br>That Krishna calls out to
	<SYNC Start=5437390>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5437990>
	  <P>If someone garlands Krishna<br>With her entwined arms
	<SYNC Start=5442390>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5442620>
	  <P>How can Radha be not jealous?
	<SYNC Start=5445110>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5447550>
	  <P>Her body and heart<br>Are on fire
	<SYNC Start=5449470>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5449670>
	  <P>How can Radha be not jealous?
	<SYNC Start=5452150>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5494900>
	  <P>If Radha is enshrined<br>In Krishna's heart
	<SYNC Start=5498900>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5499270>
	  <P>Why doesn't he tell her so?
	<SYNC Start=5503270>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5504350>
	  <P>Love has its own language<br>Its own expression
	<SYNC Start=5508310>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5508740>
	  <P>Let the eyes speak<br>Such is Krishna's sweet wish
	<SYNC Start=5513070>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5513270>
	  <P>These eyes of yours<br>O Krishna
	<SYNC Start=5515230>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5515380>
	  <P>They destroy the peace<br>Of many a nymph's heart
	<SYNC Start=5518660>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5522630>
	  <P>She meets your eyes<br>And is in love
	<SYNC Start=5524790>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5525020>
	  <P>Even if she be<br>The fairest damsel
	<SYNC Start=5527300>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5527510>
	  <P>If love for Krishna ripens<br>In a nymph's heart
	<SYNC Start=5531870>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5532230>
	  <P>Why is Radha jealous?
	<SYNC Start=5534990>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5536990>
	  <P>How can Radha be not jealous?
	<SYNC Start=5539670>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5610960>
	  <P>Gauri, you sing<br>and dance beautifully.
	<SYNC Start=5615680>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5669680>
	  <P>Elizabeth, this is Lt. Edward Wesson.<br>This is Lt. Richard North.
	<SYNC Start=5674270>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5674480>
	  <P>- How do you do?<br>- Charmed.
	<SYNC Start=5676200>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5676400>
	  <P>Sir, there's a villager<br>who'd like to speak with you.
	<SYNC Start=5680510>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5680720>
	  <P>Not now. Tomorrow.
	<SYNC Start=5682270>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5682480>
	  <P>He says he has some important<br>information about the match.
	<SYNC Start=5687280>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5689120>
	  <P>Excuse me.
	<SYNC Start=5690480>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5700670>
	  <P>Sahib.
	<SYNC Start=5701670>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5702550>
	  <P>Long live our protector.
	<SYNC Start=5704670>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5705510>
	  <P>- What is it you want to tell me?<br>- Bhuvan is training his team. But ...
	<SYNC Start=5710670>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5711360>
	  <P>But what?
	<SYNC Start=5712480>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5712680>
	  <P>Spare my life, "sahib"!
	<SYNC Start=5714680>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5714880>
	  <P>But a white "memsahib"<br>from here ...
	<SYNC Start=5717320>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5717550>
	  <P>... teaches them the game.
	<SYNC Start=5719720>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5720350>
	  <P>White "memsahib"?
	<SYNC Start=5721470>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5721710>
	  <P>Yes, "sahib."<br>I saw her with my own eyes today.
	<SYNC Start=5725310>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5725550>
	  <P>She also came to attend<br>the prayer at our temple today.
	<SYNC Start=5729280>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5741550>
	  <P>Is the white "memsahib" among them?
	<SYNC Start=5744070>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5749520>
	  <P>There she is.
	<SYNC Start=5750680>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5755560>
	  <P>- You're not making a mistake?<br>- You can hang me if I'm mistaken.
	<SYNC Start=5759920>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5760150>
	  <P>I swear.<br>She's the one.
	<SYNC Start=5761880>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5767760>
	  <P>So you too are in the team?
	<SYNC Start=5769680>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5769880>
	  <P>I'm not crazy like Bhuvan to<br>challenge the might of the government.
	<SYNC Start=5774950>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5775760>
	  <P>Why are you telling me all this?
	<SYNC Start=5779070>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5780320>
	  <P>Only the slaughtered beast knows<br>the agony of death.
	<SYNC Start=5784080>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5784950>
	  <P>I too am in agony.
	<SYNC Start=5786830>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5787120>
	  <P>Let's just say that my victory<br>lies in Bhuvan's defeat.
	<SYNC Start=5792120>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5799960>
	  <P>What is your name?<br>Your name?
	<SYNC Start=5801920>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5802120>
	  <P>Lakha, "sahib."
	<SYNC Start=5803450>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5804720>
	  <P>Lakha ...
	<SYNC Start=5806080>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5807120>
	  <P>... this is what you do:
	<SYNC Start=5808720>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5808960>
	  <P>You join Bhuvan's team.
	<SYNC Start=5812280>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5812690>
	  <P>- What are you saying, "sahib"?<br>- You will join Bhuvan's team.
	<SYNC Start=5817090>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5817290>
	  <P>But you will work for me.
	<SYNC Start=5819880>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5825370>
	  <P>I understand, "sahib."
	<SYNC Start=5826920>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5838960>
	  <P>Yes, Andrew?
	<SYNC Start=5840680>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5841160>
	  <P>What is it?
	<SYNC Start=5842650>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5842850>
	  <P>So you've been sightseeing.
	<SYNC Start=5845010>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5845210>
	  <P>How's the countryside?
	<SYNC Start=5847280>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5848560>
	  <P>It's beautiful.
	<SYNC Start=5850680>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5851290>
	  <P>The mountains, the woods,<br>the cattle.
	<SYNC Start=5854560>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5854800>
	  <P>And the villages?
	<SYNC Start=5856290>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5858530>
	  <P>- I didn't see any.<br>- My foot, you didn't!
	<SYNC Start=5861730>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5861960>
	  <P>You were teaching them cricket!<br>You thought I wouldn't know?
	<SYNC Start=5866600>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5866840>
	  <P>You had the audacity to go<br>against your own brother?
	<SYNC Start=5870290>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5870570>
	  <P>Now you listen to me carefully.
	<SYNC Start=5872880>
	  <P>&nbsp;
	<SYNC Start=5873120>
	  <P>You will not meet them again ...
