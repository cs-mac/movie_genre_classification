00:01:03,783 --> 00:01:06,229




2
00:01:46,058 --> 00:01:48,390
Mandela, Mandela, Mandela

3
00:01:49,294 --> 00:01:52,172
Mandela, Mandela, Mandela

4
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,709
Who is sir?  It's that terrorist
Mandela, they let him out

5
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:03,098
Remember this day boys, it's the
day our country went to the dogs

6
00:02:04,376 --> 00:02:05,502
come, let's go, come

7
00:02:07,046 --> 00:02:09,128
I'm now in a position
to announce

8
00:02:09,148 --> 00:02:12,891
The Lord Nelson Mandela will be released
at the prison

9
00:02:13,252 --> 00:02:15,629
on Sunday,the eleventh of
February at about 3 pm

10
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,915
There's Mr. Nelson Mandela

11
00:02:21,226 --> 00:02:23,239
Mr. Mandela a free man

12
00:02:23,262 --> 00:02:26,379
Taking his first steps
 into a new South Africa

13
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:30,427
This is the moment the world
has been waiting for

14
00:02:31,136 --> 00:02:35,220
...and the top news of the day
here in South Africa and around the world

15
00:02:35,574 --> 00:02:37,963
The recent release of Nelson Mandela
from prison

16
00:02:37,976 --> 00:02:41,354
has triggered a power struggle
between the ANC and their rivals

17
00:02:43,748 --> 00:02:46,239
there are reports the government
is secretly providing

18
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,990
arms to these groups

19
00:02:49,821 --> 00:02:51,880
contributing to violence
that has erupted across the country

20
00:02:52,356 --> 00:02:56,008
South Africa seems to be
on the verge of civil war

21
00:02:56,394 --> 00:02:58,350
Mr. Mandela has traveled to Durban

22
00:02:58,362 --> 00:03:01,681
in an effort to persuade 100,000
angry young ANC supporters

23
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,126
to make peace

24
00:03:04,502 --> 00:03:06,891
Take your knives and your guns

25
00:03:07,605 --> 00:03:11,143
and throw them into the sea

26
00:03:15,179 --> 00:03:17,682
After 4 years of talks

27
00:03:18,082 --> 00:03:21,097
the day black South Africans have been
fighting for has finally arrived

28
00:03:21,486 --> 00:03:24,262
for the first time they are free
to cast their vote

29
00:03:24,255 --> 00:03:25,688
along side whites

30
00:03:26,398 --> 00:03:30,348
And an estimated 23 million people
went to the polls today

31
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:33,920
I Nelson Mandela

32
00:03:35,065 --> 00:03:40,025
do hearby swear to be faithful
to the Rebublic of South Africa

33
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,504
Never, never

34
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,713
And never again

35
00:03:47,911 --> 00:03:50,550
shall it be that 
this beautiful land

36
00:03:51,047 --> 00:03:55,791
will again experience the oppression
of one by another

37
00:03:56,887 --> 00:03:59,799
and suffer the indignity

38
00:04:01,224 --> 00:04:02,839
of being the skunk of the world

39
00:04:58,347 --> 00:05:00,338
there he is,
like clockwork

40
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,786
that makes him such
an easy target

41
00:05:14,864 --> 00:05:15,979
yes, good morning

42
00:05:16,265 --> 00:05:18,096
morning morning
how are you?

43
00:05:20,703 --> 00:05:22,819
how's your mother?

44
00:05:23,872 --> 00:05:25,999
she's much better thanks-you
good, very good

45
00:06:07,482 --> 00:06:08,380
Watch your left

46
00:06:12,787 --> 00:06:14,140
Mandela, Mandela

47
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:27,218
alright

48
00:06:31,838 --> 00:06:32,805
What does it say?

49
00:06:33,941 --> 00:06:38,890
it says he can win an election,
but can he run a country

50
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:41,928
not even one day on the job,
and they are after you

51
00:06:43,116 --> 00:06:45,600
It's a legitimate question

52
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:35,765
Today marks the beginning of a
new era in South Africa

53
00:07:36,402 --> 00:07:38,916
as President Mandela 
takes office in Pretoria

54
00:07:39,805 --> 00:07:44,435
facing issues that range from ecomomic
stagnation, unemployment and crime

55
00:07:45,011 --> 00:07:47,138
While at the same time balancing
black aspirations

56
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,204
With white fears

57
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:52,310
yeah, I never thought I'd see the day

58
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:55,979
I feel sorry for you son, you've
got your whole life ahead of you

59
00:07:56,288 --> 00:07:57,550
what's it going to be like now?

60
00:07:57,556 --> 00:08:00,571
ah, don't be so gloomy
now I added vitamins

61
00:08:00,926 --> 00:08:04,566
There is a horrible flu bug going around
tell me when you get home

62
00:08:04,864 --> 00:08:06,058
Thanks mom

63
00:08:06,432 --> 00:08:08,080
now I'm telling you Francois

64
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:10,647
Look at Angola, Mozambique
look at Zimbabwe

65
00:08:11,536 --> 00:08:15,188
we're next, they're going to take
 our jobs and drive us into the sea

66
00:08:16,441 --> 00:08:17,294
just you wait

67
00:08:35,493 --> 00:08:36,562
Good morning.

thank-you, we need to talk about
your cabinet appointments and ministers

72
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,535

74
00:09:20,037 --> 00:09:20,765

for me

76
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:26,015
all those who haven't
already left

77
00:09:26,376 --> 00:09:28,992
"Right now? All of them?
- Yes please

78
00:09:29,947 --> 00:09:30,766
Yes, Mr. President

79
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,926
Ladies and gentlemen if would
like to follow me please

80
00:09:36,186 --> 00:09:38,507
The president would like
 to speak with you

81
00:09:45,496 --> 00:09:46,599
here he comes
yeah

82
00:09:47,097 --> 00:09:49,440
wants the satisfaction of
firing us himself

83
00:09:50,501 --> 00:09:53,049
I'd like you to stay out here
Yes, but we...

84
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,573
I cannot talk to them hiding
behind men with guns

85
00:09:58,007 --> 00:09:59,326
Good morning

86
00:10:02,378 --> 00:10:04,198
Good morning, how are you
this morning?

87
00:10:05,581 --> 00:10:06,684
Good to see you

88
00:10:07,817 --> 00:10:09,921
Thank-you for coming
on such short notice

89
00:10:11,387 --> 00:10:13,309
Some of you may know who I am

90
00:10:15,258 --> 00:10:20,252
I could not help noticing 
the empty offices

91
00:10:21,297 --> 00:10:22,844
as I came to work this morning

92
00:10:23,766 --> 00:10:25,506
And all of the packing boxes

93
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:29,365
Now, of course, if you
want to leave

94
00:10:30,473 --> 00:10:34,603
that is your right
and if you feel in your heart

95
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:38,076
that you cannot work with
your new government

96
00:10:38,414 --> 00:10:41,793
Then it is better that
you do leave, right away

97
00:10:43,186 --> 00:10:46,292
But if you are packing up
because you fear

98
00:10:47,023 --> 00:10:50,459
that, your language,
or the color of your skin

99
00:10:52,093 --> 00:10:53,981
Or who you worked for before

100
00:10:53,995 --> 00:10:56,532
Disqualifies you from working here

101
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:58,718
I am here to tell you

102
00:10:58,733 --> 00:11:00,917
have no such fear

103
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:03,970
What remains remains

104
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,721
the past is the past

105
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:09,400
we look to the future now

106
00:11:11,112 --> 00:11:12,340
We need your help

107
00:11:12,614 --> 00:11:14,229
We want your help

108
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,272
if you would like to stay

109
00:11:18,753 --> 00:11:22,553
you would be doing your country
a great service

110
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:25,451
All I ask

111
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:29,499
is that you do your work to
the best of your abiities

112
00:11:30,532 --> 00:11:31,783
And with good heart

113
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,224
I promise to do the same

114
00:11:35,837 --> 00:11:37,350
If we can manage that

115
00:11:37,372 --> 00:11:41,217
Our country will be a
shining light in the world

116
00:11:52,786 --> 00:11:54,196
good morning


117
00:11:54,521 --> 00:11:55,715

These men were
specially trained by the SAS

145
00:13:42,994 --> 00:13:44,484
they have lots of experience

146
00:13:44,496 --> 00:13:47,317

Forgiveness liberates the soul

173
00:15:35,004 --> 00:15:35,982
How can we trust them?

00:15:36,306 --> 00:15:38,274
we can't
that's what Mandela wants, OK?

175
00:15:38,608 --> 00:15:39,632
Let's go

00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,743

00:15:46,749 --> 00:15:47,966
no, oh yes

178
00:15:49,118 --> 00:15:52,531
Mandela  does not like when you don't
smile when you push people away

179
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,575
seriously?

180
00:15:54,891 --> 00:15:56,256
Yes, seriously

181
00:15:57,327 --> 00:15:58,874

182
00:16:00,296 --> 00:16:03,584
"Mandela?

183
00:16:04,834 --> 00:16:05,903
that's what we call him

184
00:16:08,338 --> 00:16:09,703
We'll call him Mr. President

185
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,418
can we go through
the schedule now?

186
00:16:14,777 --> 00:16:15,846
can you gentlemen come closer?

187
00:16:23,452 --> 00:16:25,192
Yeah, me too

188
00:16:25,921 --> 00:16:28,355
What are our orders

189
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,567
how is going to do all this, huh?

190
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,187
when does he take a break?

191
00:16:32,561 --> 00:16:34,552
he says he rested enough,
in prison

192
00:16:36,832 --> 00:16:38,265
here's a headache
what?

193
00:16:40,435 --> 00:16:41,629
the rugby match

194
00:16:42,204 --> 00:16:44,513
England against Springboks

195
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,284
at the stadium

196
00:16:46,642 --> 00:16:48,462
Will be a headache for
England that's for sure

197
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:51,739
I don't care about the game

198
00:16:52,281 --> 00:16:54,511
all I care about is that
the president will be exposed

199
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,512
2000 drunken football...
sports fans, mmm?

200
00:17:00,722 --> 00:17:01,996
yes, sports fans

201
00:17:02,558 --> 00:17:05,789
who didn't vote for him,
who probably hate him

202
00:17:06,828 --> 00:17:08,898
who came out of the womb
with guns in their hands

203
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:14,573
What?

204
00:17:46,534 --> 00:17:49,378
OK guys, I want your
eyes on the crowd at all times

205
00:17:50,471 --> 00:17:52,689
he's taking the middle of the field

206
00:17:52,673 --> 00:17:54,846
going to walk in, shake hands,
and walk off, that's it

207
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:56,608
 Got it


208
00:17:57,511 --> 00:17:58,478
OK, let's go

209
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:20,481
Ladies and gentlemen, it is our
pleasure today

210
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,206
to introduce our newly
elected president

211
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,590
Mr. Nelson Mandela

212
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:44,849
Good luck captain

213
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:46,555
Thank-you Mr. President

214
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:50,267
Good luck son
good luck

215
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,448
Good luck Chester
yes sir

216
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,021
Good luck
- Thanks.

217
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,295
stop him
no, stay with him

218
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:46,030
Thank you for honoring our new flag

219
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:47,565
it's a pleasure sir

220
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:48,763
Thank-you

221
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:50,715
how are you?
how are you?

222
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:52,331
Good to see

223
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:54,671
Good to see

224
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:58,801
Mandela, Mandela
you are delaying the rugby sir

225
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:00,768
Yes, yes of course

226
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:16,904
why didn't you stop him?
you try next time

227
00:20:17,248 --> 00:20:19,011
does he do that sort of thing
all of the time?

228
00:20:19,383 --> 00:20:20,498
that's my answers

229
00:20:20,918 --> 00:20:22,681
good thing it was just a cup

230
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,556
and good thing he never saw it

231
00:20:24,555 --> 00:20:25,999
oh he saw it, he sees everything

232
00:20:27,358 --> 00:20:28,256
I hate rugby

233
00:21:04,094 --> 00:21:06,767
Fuck man

234
00:21:07,063 --> 00:21:09,361
these english mean business

235
00:21:10,967 --> 00:21:12,685
we need to focus...
FOCUS FOCUS

236
00:21:15,505 --> 00:21:16,529
Let

237
00:21:29,219 --> 00:21:31,301
why don't we do a little work
while we watch

238
00:21:31,621 --> 00:21:33,259
we have a lot of promises to keep

239
00:21:33,657 --> 00:21:34,646
yes we do

240
00:21:41,798 --> 00:21:45,905
It's not too late
if the boys can pick up their game

241
00:21:46,202 --> 00:21:48,090
if they don't
heads will roll

242
00:21:52,074 --> 00:21:53,610
c'mon you bloody bastards

243
00:22:03,018 --> 00:22:05,361
where do you want to go first
for foreign investment?

244
00:22:05,688 --> 00:22:09,101
where the money is.
America, England...

245
00:22:10,092 --> 00:22:11,070
Saudi Arabia

246
00:22:17,066 --> 00:22:20,604
How long before the world cup?
about a year

247
00:22:22,738 --> 00:22:24,945
now is time enough for improvement

248
00:22:26,542 --> 00:22:27,543
Mr. President

249
00:22:29,144 --> 00:22:30,862
don't get your hopes up

250
00:22:31,714 --> 00:22:33,773
we're a damn disgrace

251
00:22:39,288 --> 00:22:42,427
did you see all those old
aparthied flicks?

252
00:22:42,724 --> 00:22:45,807
they're a disgrace
but it's also the constitution

253
00:22:47,462 --> 00:22:49,771
along with the aparthied 
anthem, I know

254
00:22:50,598 --> 00:22:52,839
But it's time people moved on

255
00:22:56,537 --> 00:22:57,481
look at this

256
00:22:58,806 --> 00:23:01,468
all of the whites are
cheering for the Springboks

257
00:23:03,077 --> 00:23:05,284
all of the blacks are cheering
for England

258
00:23:09,417 --> 00:23:10,896
I used to do that
on the island

259
00:23:11,953 --> 00:23:13,921
we would cheer for anyone
but the 'boks

260
00:23:15,556 --> 00:23:17,205
it made the wardens
very angry

261
00:23:18,226 --> 00:23:19,238
of course it did

262
00:23:23,965 --> 00:23:26,593
sorry I'm late, how's it going?
very badly

263
00:23:32,573 --> 00:23:34,279
maybe it's just as well

264
00:23:34,642 --> 00:23:36,063
why?

265
00:23:38,211 --> 00:23:41,317
I've just been at a meeting
of the national sports executive

266
00:23:43,984 --> 00:23:48,011
there's a strong support to drop
the Springbok emblem and colors

267
00:23:48,922 --> 00:23:50,992
if they play badly

268
00:23:51,992 --> 00:23:53,869
maybe it's a good time
to make a change

269
00:23:55,162 --> 00:23:58,529
this could be the last time we 
have to look at the green and gold

270
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:41,857
Francois' team came to the stadium
this afternoon

271
00:24:42,008 --> 00:24:44,420
unprepared and arrogant

272
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:49,134
They left 80 minutes with their
tales between their legs

273
00:24:49,448 --> 00:24:50,892
like whipped mongorels

274
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,286
and I for one,
am glad

275
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,244
not because they lost

276
00:24:55,287 --> 00:24:58,267
but because there is 
now no way

277
00:24:58,591 --> 00:25:02,345
to ignore the fact that we are
completely and utterly unprepared

278
00:25:02,661 --> 00:25:06,131
To re-enter the world of
top-notch international rugby

279
00:25:06,532 --> 00:25:10,081
The Rugby World Cup is 
now less than a year away

280
00:25:10,469 --> 00:25:13,825
and I for one am relieved that
we are the host nation

281
00:25:14,106 --> 00:25:16,415
and there for qualify
automatically for the tournament

282
00:25:16,809 --> 00:25:18,117
somebody gets the axe

283
00:25:18,444 --> 00:25:21,220
because I'm not sure we can get
in on merit alone

284
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:23,116
who's it gonna be?

285
00:25:23,449 --> 00:25:26,394
team played without discipline

286
00:25:26,751 --> 00:25:28,082
Without strategy

287
00:25:28,686 --> 00:25:30,768
And without courage

288
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:33,420
and there for...
he's trying to get them to drop me

289
00:25:33,725 --> 00:25:36,831
he's just bitter because the Springboks
were boycotted when he played

290
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:38,636
Maybe

291
00:25:39,064 --> 00:25:40,850
But people listen to 
what he says

292
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:43,191
They brought shame upon our nation

293
00:25:44,102 --> 00:25:46,650
and I for one can say without 
fear of contradiction

294
00:25:47,806 --> 00:25:49,535
that today, these 15

295
00:25:51,376 --> 00:25:52,593
so called, men

296
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:56,750
did not deserve to wear
the hallowed green and gold

297
00:26:00,685 --> 00:26:01,834
Here's your tea, Mr. Mandela

298
00:26:02,153 --> 00:26:04,394
I warmed the milk tonight

299
00:26:04,789 --> 00:26:06,507
ahh, you are too good to me Mary

300
00:26:08,526 --> 00:26:11,336
your daughter called to cancel her
visit this weekend

301
00:26:14,199 --> 00:26:16,747
Did she say why?
No, she didn't

302
00:26:17,068 --> 00:26:18,660
she said to tell you
she was sorry

303
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:24,771
I see
do you need anything else tonight?

304
00:26:26,143 --> 00:26:28,259
ahh, no Mary thank you,
I'll go to bed

305
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,323
good evening

306
00:26:31,415 --> 00:26:32,382
good evening Mary

307
00:27:04,047 --> 00:27:06,117
some nice pants for you
God bless you

308
00:27:08,218 --> 00:27:09,230
there you go

309
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:11,451
there you go

310
00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:13,948
God bless you

311
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:20,900
you're a very lucky boy

312
00:27:21,531 --> 00:27:23,396
it's a real Springbok
practice jersey

313
00:27:25,067 --> 00:27:27,968
I know it's a bit big, but it's
warm and it will last forever

314
00:27:29,772 --> 00:27:31,865
c'mon, take it, it's yours

315
00:27:35,711 --> 00:27:36,678
why won't he take it?

316
00:27:36,712 --> 00:27:39,215
if he wears it, the others
will beat him up

317
00:27:39,549 --> 00:27:42,564
because the Springboks are so bad?
no

318
00:27:42,885 --> 00:27:46,332
because for them, Springboks still
represent aparthied

319
00:27:54,463 --> 00:27:56,920
and now, for the next
item on our agenda

320
00:27:58,668 --> 00:28:02,434
the embassy executive proposes
a vote on the following motion

321
00:28:03,906 --> 00:28:06,727
that, as a permanent symbol
of the aparthied era

322
00:28:07,877 --> 00:28:10,310
The colors emblem

323
00:28:10,312 --> 00:28:12,701
and the name of Springboks

324
00:28:13,181 --> 00:28:15,775
Be eliminated immediately

325
00:28:19,187 --> 00:28:20,802
and that all sports teams

326
00:28:20,822 --> 00:28:22,619
representing South Africa

327
00:28:23,658 --> 00:28:26,195
shall be known,


328
00:28:28,129 --> 00:28:29,778
as the Proteos

329
00:28:30,732 --> 00:28:34,293
Comrades, we will submit this
motion to a hand vote

330
00:28:34,636 --> 00:28:36,786
and in the event of a close count

331
00:28:38,006 --> 00:28:39,587
will go to a written ballot

332
00:28:40,709 --> 00:28:44,463
all of those in favor of
eliminating the Springboks

333
00:28:44,779 --> 00:28:46,030
Raise your hands

334
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:54,001
Viva Proteos Viva

335
00:28:54,356 --> 00:28:55,994
Viva

336
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,176
both units to their cars, right now

337
00:29:16,477 --> 00:29:19,219
what do I tell the 
Japanese trade delegation?

338
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,161
I delegate that decision to you

339
00:29:21,482 --> 00:29:23,404
do you want me to inform the VP?
No

340
00:29:23,717 --> 00:29:25,947
we should at least include
the minister of sport

341
00:29:25,986 --> 00:29:27,226
No

342
00:29:27,221 --> 00:29:30,930
I strongly advise against doing this,
especially on your own

343
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:33,164
it gives the impression of
autocratic leadership

344
00:29:34,495 --> 00:29:36,383
you risk alienating your cabinet
and your party

345
00:29:37,364 --> 00:29:39,013
your advice is duley noted

346
00:29:38,999 --> 00:29:41,490
Dear Mandela, the
people want this

347
00:29:41,835 --> 00:29:45,464
they hate the Springboks, they don't
want to be represented by them

348
00:29:46,307 --> 00:29:49,003
yes I know, but in this
instance, the people are wrong

349
00:29:49,009 --> 00:29:52,319
and as their leader, it is
my job to show them that

350
00:29:52,646 --> 00:29:54,853
you are risking your political capitol

351
00:29:55,215 --> 00:29:57,080
you're risking your future
as our leader

352
00:29:57,084 --> 00:30:01,292
the day I am afraid to do that, is
the day I am no longer fit to lead

353
00:30:05,124 --> 00:30:08,719
at least, risk it for something
more important than rugby

354
00:30:08,761 --> 00:30:11,070
tell the boys I want to go
very fast

355
00:30:26,145 --> 00:30:27,521
we, the executives

356
00:30:27,513 --> 00:30:29,162
would like to applaud you

357
00:30:29,182 --> 00:30:31,047
for your diligence

358
00:30:31,384 --> 00:30:32,578
and your courage

359
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,314
please, join us in
our anthem

360
00:31:11,289 --> 00:31:12,210
Comrades, comrades

361
00:31:12,524 --> 00:31:16,001
members of the choir, we would
only interupt such beautiful music

362
00:31:16,495 --> 00:31:18,577
For something truly important

363
00:31:19,531 --> 00:31:23,194
Please, welcome,
President Mandela

364
00:31:33,512 --> 00:31:34,999
Thank-you

365
00:31:39,851 --> 00:31:40,999
Thank-you

366
00:31:46,358 --> 00:31:47,278
I thank you, please

367
00:31:50,461 --> 00:31:51,999
Smile

368
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,540
Brothers

369
00:31:58,035 --> 00:31:59,059
sisters

370
00:32:00,237 --> 00:32:01,181
Comrades

371
00:32:03,441 --> 00:32:08,037
I am here because I believe
you have made a decision

372
00:32:08,345 --> 00:32:10,848
with insufficient information

373
00:32:12,383 --> 00:32:13,736
and foresight

374
00:32:14,585 --> 00:32:16,792
I am aware of your earlier vote

375
00:32:19,256 --> 00:32:23,067
I am aware that it was,
unanimous

376
00:32:26,797 --> 00:32:32,462
none the less, I believe we should
restore the Springboks

377
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:38,944
Restore their name

378
00:32:38,943 --> 00:32:42,742
their emblem, and their colors,
Immediately

379
00:32:46,583 --> 00:32:48,141
let me tell you why

380
00:32:49,652 --> 00:32:50,823
on Rogha lsland

381
00:32:51,221 --> 00:32:53,212
In prison

382
00:32:54,524 --> 00:32:57,539
all of my jailers were
Afrikaners

383
00:32:59,128 --> 00:33:00,402
For 27 years

384
00:33:02,198 --> 00:33:03,597
I studied them

385
00:33:05,735 --> 00:33:07,418
I learned their language

386
00:33:09,305 --> 00:33:10,613
Read their books

387
00:33:12,675 --> 00:33:13,676
their poetry

388
00:33:15,612 --> 00:33:20,807
I had to know my enemy before
I could prevail against him

389
00:33:21,885 --> 00:33:24,999
and we did prevail,
did we not?

390
00:33:25,722 --> 00:33:27,064
all of us here

391
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:29,267
we prevailed

392
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,559
Our enemy is no longer
the Afrikaner

393
00:33:35,098 --> 00:33:37,736
they are our fellow
South Africans

394
00:33:39,067 --> 00:33:40,182
Our partners

395
00:33:40,536 --> 00:33:42,174
in democracy

396
00:33:43,872 --> 00:33:45,715
and they treasure

397
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:47,851
Springbok Rugby 

398
00:33:50,879 --> 00:33:54,187
if we take that away,
we lose them

399
00:33:56,552 --> 00:34:00,932
we prove that we are what
they feared we would be

400
00:34:04,726 --> 00:34:06,125
We have to be better than that

401
00:34:08,897 --> 00:34:10,398
We have to surprise them

402
00:34:11,867 --> 00:34:13,118
With compassion

403
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,486
With restraint

404
00:34:17,406 --> 00:34:18,714
And  generosity

405
00:34:21,009 --> 00:34:25,865
I know,
all of the things they denied us

406
00:34:26,888 --> 00:34:31,888
but this is no time to
celebrate petty revenge

407
00:34:34,255 --> 00:34:36,257
this is the time to
build our nation

408
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:40,651
using every single brick
available to us

409
00:34:42,129 --> 00:34:45,223
even if that brick comes wrapped
in green and gold

410
00:34:49,971 --> 00:34:51,927
you elected me your leader

411
00:34:54,575 --> 00:34:55,701
let me lead you now

412
00:34:58,613 --> 00:34:59,999
Who is with me on this?

413
00:35:03,818 --> 00:35:04,955
Who is with me?

414
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:23,423
12 votes,
12

415
00:35:24,071 --> 00:35:25,697
a luxury

416
00:35:26,673 --> 00:35:28,561
we only needed one more
yes than no

417
00:35:29,142 --> 00:35:31,224
what if you hadn't got it?

418
00:35:32,712 --> 00:35:34,350
Well you know

419
00:35:34,381 --> 00:35:36,030
that is the parties decision

420
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,247
Sorry Mandela

421
00:35:38,251 --> 00:35:40,685
but we've got problems
everywhere we look

422
00:35:40,987 --> 00:35:44,343
Housing, food, jobs, crime
our currency

423
00:35:45,291 --> 00:35:49,273
you can't keep interupting affairs
of state to placate a minority

424
00:35:49,295 --> 00:35:52,617
I must, that minority

425
00:35:52,632 --> 00:35:54,987
Still controls the police, the army

426
00:35:55,001 --> 00:35:56,696
And the economy

427
00:35:58,371 --> 00:36:01,033
if we lose them, we cannot
address the other issues

428
00:36:03,109 --> 00:36:04,872
so, this rugby

429
00:36:04,878 --> 00:36:08,393
Is it just a political calculation?

430
00:36:11,951 --> 00:36:13,680
It is a human calculation

431
00:36:16,022 --> 00:36:18,741
if we take away, what
they cherish

432
00:36:19,591 --> 00:36:20,592
The Springboks

433
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:22,244
Their national anthem

434
00:36:22,828 --> 00:36:26,252
we just reinforce the cycle
of fear between us

435
00:36:29,168 --> 00:36:31,659
I will do what I must
to end that cycle

436
00:36:33,539 --> 00:36:34,995
or it will destroy us

437
00:37:03,635 --> 00:37:04,476
this tastes like shit man

438
00:37:06,805 --> 00:37:08,215
it's not the beer

439
00:37:11,276 --> 00:37:12,368
take another

440
00:37:12,678 --> 00:37:14,144
everybody take one

441
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:27,994
I'd like to propose a toast

442
00:37:29,393 --> 00:37:30,325
to the taste of defeat

443
00:37:32,563 --> 00:37:33,564
drink it

444
00:37:33,865 --> 00:37:35,264
remember this

445
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:39,146
and promise yourself,
never to taste it again

446
00:37:43,574 --> 00:37:44,825
You're right, it tastes like shit

447
00:37:53,785 --> 00:37:55,639
here's the schedule for
the overseas trip

448
00:38:05,797 --> 00:38:08,493
(speaking Afrikans)

449
00:38:09,466 --> 00:38:10,410
What did he just say?

450
00:38:10,734 --> 00:38:13,020
he asked when we were supposed to sleep

451
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:15,602
as well as other basic human functions

452
00:38:17,908 --> 00:38:20,149
If Mandela could do it
we can do it

453
00:38:29,386 --> 00:38:31,377
in a common struggle

454
00:38:32,622 --> 00:38:36,149
that has brought about our emancipation

455
00:38:37,227 --> 00:38:40,754
and pushed back the frontier

456
00:38:41,131 --> 00:38:42,063
Of racism

457
00:38:42,933 --> 00:38:45,254
the millions of our people

458
00:38:46,536 --> 00:38:50,120
say thank you and thank you again

459
00:38:51,107 --> 00:38:52,870
I come here with a message

460
00:38:53,143 --> 00:38:55,941
people of the
United States of America

461
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,911
open your markets to us

462
00:38:59,749 --> 00:39:02,081
and come invest in our country

463
00:39:03,285 --> 00:39:07,346
and in Japan, President Mandela
met with Japanese officials

464
00:39:07,356 --> 00:39:08,999
as he concluded a grueling
trip to the far east

465
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:13,442
and in related news, it was announced
that Mandela will visit South Africa

466
00:39:16,966 --> 00:39:17,830
stop it old man

467
00:39:25,007 --> 00:39:26,042
It's cold man

468
00:39:38,254 --> 00:39:39,369
- Good morning Mandela
- How are you?

469
00:39:39,688 --> 00:39:41,053
- Well thank you sir
- Good morning sir

470
00:39:41,891 --> 00:39:43,006
How is your family Hendrick?

471
00:39:42,992 --> 00:39:45,256
top shape sir, how about yours?

472
00:39:49,665 --> 00:39:51,189
I have a very large family

473
00:39:52,968 --> 00:39:54,276
42 million

474
00:39:59,974 --> 00:40:01,623
I don't think I'll walk today

475
00:40:04,746 --> 00:40:06,589
we never, never ask him about
his family

476
00:40:06,614 --> 00:40:08,036
but he asks about ours
all the time

477
00:40:08,049 --> 00:40:09,448
Think, think of it

478
00:40:09,450 --> 00:40:11,372
Separated from his wife,
his children

479
00:40:11,386 --> 00:40:12,910
How often do you see them here?

480
00:40:16,958 --> 00:40:18,755
He's not a saint,
he's a man

481
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,116
with a man's problems, he doesn't
need us reminding him of them

482
00:40:32,941 --> 00:40:34,886
Good morning Mandela.
- Good morning

483
00:40:36,778 --> 00:40:38,998
Thank you very much.
- Enjoy it

484
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:52,284
Very good

485
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,427
Very good

486
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,792
ahh Brenda, good morning

487
00:41:00,801 --> 00:41:03,292
Good morning Mandela
I like that dress

488
00:41:04,137 --> 00:41:04,933
Thank you

489
00:41:05,238 --> 00:41:07,001
This is for you

490
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:10,279
What is it?
Your pay checks

491
00:41:10,277 --> 00:41:11,539
you haven't been collecting them

492
00:41:14,982 --> 00:41:15,755
what's wrong?

493
00:41:15,782 --> 00:41:16,919
This is terrible

494
00:41:18,251 --> 00:41:19,889
It's what deClerk got

495
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,683
plus an increase for inflation

496
00:41:27,861 --> 00:41:30,648
Today President Mandela
announced, that in his opinion

497
00:41:31,298 --> 00:41:34,790
his salary is too high
He's right, they're all overpaid

498
00:41:35,102 --> 00:41:39,084
he has decided to donate a third
of his monthly income to charity

499
00:41:41,375 --> 00:41:44,697
give me the houses and cars they give him
and I'll donate a third to charity too

500
00:41:46,246 --> 00:41:47,075
Hello

501
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:49,131
hang on a minute please

502
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:53,580
yes, of course

503
00:41:57,189 --> 00:41:59,999
they're lining their pockets
as fast as they can

504
00:42:01,093 --> 00:42:02,390
must be his girl friend eh

505
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:04,658
Oh, he knows I'll bloody
well kill him

506
00:42:07,133 --> 00:42:08,134
what?

507
00:42:09,135 --> 00:42:09,897
Who was that?

508
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:12,690
well...
I told you it was his girl friend

509
00:42:14,974 --> 00:42:16,145
I've been invited to tea

510
00:42:17,043 --> 00:42:18,852
with who?
the President

511
00:42:20,179 --> 00:42:21,385
The president of the SA rugby?

512
00:42:22,214 --> 00:42:23,999
Count your fingers after he shakes
your hand boy

513
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:25,712
The President

514
00:42:30,723 --> 00:42:32,941
he wants me over for tea,
week after next

515
00:42:35,895 --> 00:42:40,241
you must tell Mandela that the
pass service is very bad

516
00:42:40,533 --> 00:42:41,885
and too expensive

517
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,158
he must do something about it.
Good night everybody

518
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:46,489
Good night

519
00:42:48,773 --> 00:42:50,999
What the hell does he want with you?

520
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,148
I don't know

521
00:43:01,019 --> 00:43:02,850
you've met him before

522
00:43:03,688 --> 00:43:04,950
I shook his hand on the rugby field

523
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:06,839
and you didn't even vote

524
00:43:07,158 --> 00:43:08,671
c'mon, he's still the president

525
00:43:09,894 --> 00:43:11,646
I play rugby, what am I
going to say to the guy

526
00:43:11,963 --> 00:43:13,908
say to him, thank-you for
inviting me

527
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:17,480
what if I pull something
stupid in front of him

528
00:43:18,336 --> 00:43:19,246
you won't

529
00:43:19,237 --> 00:43:20,659
go ahead, I'll pick you up right here

530
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:25,352
bye
Mr. Francois

531
00:43:27,979 --> 00:43:29,105
a picture please

532
00:43:37,921 --> 00:43:39,070
They can not pass

533
00:43:39,389 --> 00:43:41,300
They can not pass

534
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,628
see who's coming for tea?

535
00:43:51,635 --> 00:43:53,523
if you want me to get his
autograph

536
00:43:54,705 --> 00:43:56,502
who?
Francois Penaar

537
00:43:57,541 --> 00:43:59,418
call him in
 I will

538
00:44:00,777 --> 00:44:02,472
No autographs, OK?
I know how to do my job, OK?

539
00:44:05,549 --> 00:44:06,823
Who is Francois Penaar?

540
00:44:07,184 --> 00:44:10,369
you can't be serious,
he's the captain of the Springboks

541
00:44:11,688 --> 00:44:13,007
I like soccer myself

542
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:14,469
you know what they say about soccer

543
00:44:14,791 --> 00:44:17,146
it's a gentlemans game,
played by hooligans

544
00:44:17,494 --> 00:44:18,335
On the other hand

545
00:44:18,662 --> 00:44:20,505
Rugby is a hooligans game,
played by gentlemen

546
00:44:20,531 --> 00:44:22,226
ya ya ya, I've heard that one before

547
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,251
And it wasn't funny the first time

548
00:44:27,504 --> 00:44:28,380
Can I ask you a question lieutenant?

549
00:44:28,605 --> 00:44:29,390
yeah, of course

550
00:44:31,007 --> 00:44:32,406
what's he like?

551
00:44:32,742 --> 00:44:35,905
when I worked for the previous president,
it was my job to be invisible

552
00:44:36,245 --> 00:44:38,941
This president, when he found out
I liked english toffee

553
00:44:39,182 --> 00:44:41,184
he brought me some back from
his visit in England

554
00:44:42,685 --> 00:44:43,856
to him, no one's invisible

555
00:44:45,721 --> 00:44:46,642
That's where you wait

556
00:44:46,923 --> 00:44:48,447
One of his assistants will come for you

557
00:44:48,724 --> 00:44:50,806
and the bathroom's over there
if you need it

558
00:44:51,861 --> 00:44:52,907
uh, OK, thanks

559
00:44:55,932 --> 00:44:57,570
What are our chances
in the world cup?

560
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,001
I mean, for real

561
00:45:01,637 --> 00:45:03,514
We'll do our best, that
I can guarantee

562
00:45:10,179 --> 00:45:11,009
Office of the President

563
00:45:17,753 --> 00:45:18,538
so, what is he like?

564
00:45:19,789 --> 00:45:21,199
well he's not as big as he
looks on TV

565
00:45:22,458 --> 00:45:25,142
and we don't stand a bloody chance
in the world cup

566
00:45:36,104 --> 00:45:38,820
Mr. Penaar
right this way please

567
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:46,687
Francois

568
00:45:47,949 --> 00:45:49,450
what an honor

569
00:45:50,418 --> 00:45:51,578
I am so excited

570
00:45:52,687 --> 00:45:56,191
Thank-you for coming to see me
thank-you for inviting me Mr President

571
00:45:57,759 --> 00:46:00,284
so, tell me Francois,
how is your ankle?

572
00:46:01,363 --> 00:46:02,068
my ankle?

573
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:04,102
I was told it was hurt

574
00:46:04,933 --> 00:46:06,116
has it healed?

575
00:46:07,435 --> 00:46:12,082
the truth is sir, you never really
play at 100%, no matter what

576
00:46:12,307 --> 00:46:13,057
ahh, yes

577
00:46:13,341 --> 00:46:16,048
in sports as in life, yes?
yes sir

578
00:46:16,077 --> 00:46:19,012
Please, sit
take this one

579
00:46:19,381 --> 00:46:21,996
looking into the light hurts my eyes

580
00:46:24,885 --> 00:46:26,614
Mrs. Dreis

581
00:46:27,755 --> 00:46:29,985
you are a shining light in my day

582
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:31,746
Yes sir

583
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:34,651
this is Francois Penaar

584
00:46:34,962 --> 00:46:36,224
captain of the Springboks

585
00:46:37,064 --> 00:46:38,850
(speaking Afrikans)

586
00:46:40,334 --> 00:46:41,437
shall I pour sir?

587
00:46:41,435 --> 00:46:44,427
no, no, Iwould prefer to
do it myself

588
00:46:45,306 --> 00:46:46,603
Thank-you very much Mrs. Dreis

589
00:46:50,277 --> 00:46:51,630
how do you like your tea Francois?

590
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,040
just milk, please

591
00:46:56,784 --> 00:46:58,593
the English have given us many things

592
00:46:59,653 --> 00:47:00,915
including brandy

593
00:47:02,389 --> 00:47:04,163
But afternoon tea

594
00:47:05,459 --> 00:47:07,245
That is the greatest

595
00:47:08,562 --> 00:47:09,722
Here we are

596
00:47:10,964 --> 00:47:11,771
Thank you sir

597
00:47:12,633 --> 00:47:14,554
You have a very difficult job

598
00:47:16,035 --> 00:47:17,286
I do?

599
00:47:19,238 --> 00:47:22,264
I have a trading business
Captain of the Springboks

600
00:47:24,243 --> 00:47:25,562
a very difficult job

601
00:47:27,513 --> 00:47:28,980
well not compared to yours, Mr. President

602
00:47:31,084 --> 00:47:35,145
well, no one is trying to tear my head off
while I'm doing mine

603
00:47:36,622 --> 00:47:37,498
Yes sir

604
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:39,087
tell me Francois

605
00:47:40,793 --> 00:47:43,114
What is your philosophy on leadership

606
00:47:44,263 --> 00:47:46,549
How do you inspire your team
to do their best?

607
00:47:49,369 --> 00:47:52,202
by example, I've always thought
to lead by example sir

608
00:47:52,505 --> 00:47:55,770
well that is right
that is exactly right

609
00:47:56,609 --> 00:48:00,522
but how to get them to be better than
they think they can be

610
00:48:01,481 --> 00:48:03,506
That is very difficult I find

611
00:48:05,017 --> 00:48:06,530
inspiration perhaps

612
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,774
how do we inspire ourselves
to greatness

613
00:48:11,089 --> 00:48:12,613
When nothing less will do?

614
00:48:13,458 --> 00:48:16,097
how do we inspire everyone around us?

615
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:21,358
I sometimes think it is by using
the work of others

616
00:48:24,169 --> 00:48:25,409
on Robben lsland

617
00:48:26,805 --> 00:48:28,773
When things got very bad

618
00:48:31,109 --> 00:48:32,952
I found inspiration in a poem

619
00:48:33,645 --> 00:48:36,034
a poem?
a Victorian poem

620
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:39,696
just words

621
00:48:41,153 --> 00:48:46,090
but they helped me to stand, when
all I wanted to do was to lie down

622
00:48:49,594 --> 00:48:54,202
But you didn't come to hear an old
man talk about things that make no sense

623
00:48:54,199 --> 00:48:55,393
No, please, Mr. President

624
00:48:55,867 --> 00:48:58,222
it makes complete sense to me

625
00:48:58,270 --> 00:48:59,578
On the day of a big match

626
00:49:00,539 --> 00:49:01,528
Say, a test

627
00:49:02,808 --> 00:49:04,217
In the bus, on the
way to the stadium

628
00:49:05,009 --> 00:49:05,805
Nobody talks

629
00:49:07,011 --> 00:49:09,297
ah yes, they are all preparing

630
00:49:10,548 --> 00:49:11,264
right

631
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,071
but when I think we're ready

632
00:49:13,918 --> 00:49:15,738
I have the bus driver put a song

633
00:49:16,854 --> 00:49:18,867
something I've chosen,
one we all know

634
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:22,480
and we listen to the words together

635
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:25,915
and it helps

636
00:49:28,265 --> 00:49:30,290
I remember when I was invited

637
00:49:30,401 --> 00:49:33,871
to the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona

638
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,482
Everyone in the stadium

639
00:49:38,209 --> 00:49:39,881
greeted me with a song

640
00:49:40,744 --> 00:49:42,939
at the time, the future

641
00:49:44,181 --> 00:49:45,091
Our future

642
00:49:46,217 --> 00:49:47,206
seemed very bleak

643
00:49:49,086 --> 00:49:50,644
But to hear that song

644
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:54,196
And the voices of people all
over our planet

645
00:49:55,059 --> 00:49:57,311
made me proud to be South African

646
00:49:59,062 --> 00:50:01,769
it inspired me to come home and do better

647
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:06,301
It allowed me to expect more of myself

648
00:50:08,371 --> 00:50:09,952
may I ask, what was the song sir?

649
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:15,805
Well, it  was Ozisikilili Africa

650
00:50:17,213 --> 00:50:18,840
a very inspiring song 

651
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:23,516
We need inspiration Francois

652
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:27,941
Because in order to build
our nation

653
00:50:29,325 --> 00:50:32,385
we must all exceed our own
expectations

654
00:50:48,244 --> 00:50:48,949
so what's he like?

655
00:50:51,347 --> 00:50:53,519
he's not like anyone I've ever met before

656
00:50:54,449 --> 00:50:55,746
what did he want?

657
00:50:59,521 --> 00:51:01,569
what did he talk about?

658
00:51:03,959 --> 00:51:06,780
Francois, it's like talking to a brick wall
what did he say?

659
00:51:12,401 --> 00:51:14,084
I think he wants us to
win the World Cup

660
00:51:27,816 --> 00:51:28,635
Excuse me

661
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:43,119
What do you think?

662
00:51:45,734 --> 00:51:46,883
it doesn't matter what I think

663
00:51:47,802 --> 00:51:48,587
Yes, it does

664
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:55,479
I think he looks like one of the policemen
who forced us out of our house 

665
00:51:57,378 --> 00:51:58,970
I don't like seeing you shake his hand

666
00:51:59,947 --> 00:52:01,255
And I'm not the only one

667
00:52:05,653 --> 00:52:08,793
you criticise without understanding

668
00:52:10,524 --> 00:52:13,482
you seek only to address your
own personal feelings

669
00:52:14,495 --> 00:52:16,216
That is selfish thinking

670
00:52:18,265 --> 00:52:19,709
it does not serve the nation

671
00:52:24,405 --> 00:52:25,258
wait please

672
00:52:31,979 --> 00:52:32,889
here

673
00:52:36,684 --> 00:52:38,333
Give this to your mother for me please

674
00:52:38,618 --> 00:52:39,999
What is it?

675
00:52:40,354 --> 00:52:42,776
It's a bracelet I found unpacking

676
00:52:43,123 --> 00:52:45,284
why don't you just throw it away?

677
00:52:46,593 --> 00:52:48,743
I don't have the right,
doesn't belong to me

678
00:52:50,964 --> 00:52:53,216
if she left it, she meant
to throw it away

679
00:53:07,213 --> 00:53:09,670
"Mrs. said you finished with the paper

680
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:11,128
ya, of course

681
00:53:20,427 --> 00:53:21,303
Here we go

682
00:53:22,228 --> 00:53:24,890
The World Cup is played every 4 years

683
00:53:24,898 --> 00:53:27,389
16 teams qualify from around the world

684
00:53:28,401 --> 00:53:30,164
4 pools of 4 teams

685
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:33,116
each playing in 90 foreign venues
around the country

686
00:53:33,973 --> 00:53:37,476
2 teams will advance from
each pool to the quarterfinals

687
00:53:39,178 --> 00:53:41,476
Ivory Coast qualifies

688
00:53:41,814 --> 00:53:43,167
that's wonderful

689
00:53:43,549 --> 00:53:47,371
According to the experts, we'll reach
the quarter finals and no further

690
00:53:48,854 --> 00:53:52,176
According to the experts
you and I should still be in jail

691
00:53:56,595 --> 00:53:58,426
you make a personal appearance
in the finals

692
00:53:59,298 --> 00:54:02,438
and at the opening match
between Australia and Springboks

693
00:54:02,735 --> 00:54:06,967
the finals will be broadcast to over
a billion people around the world live

694
00:54:09,475 --> 00:54:10,385
A billion people

695
00:54:10,743 --> 00:54:11,960
watching us?

696
00:54:15,748 --> 00:54:17,329
This is a great opportunity

697
00:54:23,555 --> 00:54:25,625
I reckon you've knocked the stuffing
out of him today

698
00:54:27,926 --> 00:54:29,166
I haven't even begun

699
00:54:31,596 --> 00:54:33,973
they may not be the most talented
team in the world

700
00:54:34,832 --> 00:54:36,595
but sure as hell going to be the fittest

701
00:54:37,802 --> 00:54:38,848
let's go again guys

702
00:54:42,607 --> 00:54:43,676
Brenda
yes sir

703
00:54:44,075 --> 00:54:47,420
please get the head of South African
rugby for me

704
00:54:47,779 --> 00:54:48,734
right away
thank-you

705
00:54:59,524 --> 00:55:02,470
Dr. Ledges wants a few words please

706
00:55:06,197 --> 00:55:07,084
afternoon men

707
00:55:08,065 --> 00:55:09,339
good to see you all working so hard

708
00:55:10,868 --> 00:55:12,335
I have a short announcement

709
00:55:12,336 --> 00:55:15,225
as part of the build up
to the world cup

710
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:18,998
you will be conducting coaching
clinics in townships all over the country

711
00:55:20,044 --> 00:55:22,239
I know, I know, you've plenty
on your plates already

712
00:55:23,281 --> 00:55:25,851
But this is a request from the top

713
00:55:28,919 --> 00:55:29,783
the very top

714
00:55:31,354 --> 00:55:32,116
Thank-you

715
00:55:40,397 --> 00:55:41,329
This is complete crap man

716
00:55:41,665 --> 00:55:44,293
What is this? Are we some sort
of circus act now?

717
00:55:45,235 --> 00:55:48,375
they expect us to play our best

718
00:55:48,738 --> 00:55:51,343
give our bloody all, then
they add to our bloody work load

719
00:55:53,543 --> 00:55:54,612
What do you think about this Chester?

720
00:55:57,314 --> 00:56:00,715
well, I try not to think, cause
it interferes with my rugby

721
00:56:01,785 --> 00:56:03,161
See?

722
00:56:03,453 --> 00:56:04,659
Talk to the Captain

723
00:56:05,555 --> 00:56:07,557
you gotta make them understand that
don't have the time for this

724
00:56:09,292 --> 00:56:10,509
I'm not going to talk to them

725
00:56:10,894 --> 00:56:12,009
Why not?

726
00:56:13,730 --> 00:56:17,086
we've become more than just a rugby team

727
00:56:18,468 --> 00:56:19,912
and we might as well get used to it

728
00:56:22,605 --> 00:56:23,481
this is you speaking?

729
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:24,976
Or Mandela?

730
00:56:26,609 --> 00:56:28,088
you know me better than that

731
00:56:34,416 --> 00:56:36,156
you know times change

732
00:56:38,487 --> 00:56:39,533
and we need to change as well

733
00:57:17,859 --> 00:57:19,190
Shit
ya

734
00:57:19,527 --> 00:57:21,506
glad I don't live here

735
00:57:41,015 --> 00:57:43,711
don't forget, we've got cameras
on us at all times

736
00:57:44,552 --> 00:57:45,758
what a bloody joke

737
00:57:57,824 --> 00:58:03,823
CHESTER CHESTER CHESTER

738
00:58:07,542 --> 00:58:10,351
Chester, I reckon you're up
what am I supposed to do?

739
00:58:10,711 --> 00:58:13,588
what you do best
lets roll

740
00:58:14,915 --> 00:58:16,866
Who wants to play Rugby?

741
00:58:30,697 --> 00:58:32,233
Who here knows the rules of rugby?
me

742
00:58:32,966 --> 00:58:35,389
What is it? You hit another player
when the ref isn't looking

743
00:58:36,636 --> 00:58:37,409
No, no, no

744
00:58:37,404 --> 00:58:38,416
The first rule of Rugby

745
00:58:39,206 --> 00:58:41,527
It can only pass the ball
backwards or sideways

746
00:58:41,875 --> 00:58:43,763
do we practice today?
yeah

747
00:58:44,077 --> 00:58:45,578
Form a line

748
00:58:53,086 --> 00:58:53,950
Have fun, pasalo

749
00:58:54,988 --> 00:58:56,125
Hands up

750
00:59:03,063 --> 00:59:03,801
like this
like this

751
00:59:04,764 --> 00:59:08,268
I'm here so I 
make it like this

752
00:59:09,402 --> 00:59:10,744
Now you run

753
00:59:18,144 --> 00:59:19,725
so I want you in groups of 3, OK?

754
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:24,740
And in addition to the
nationwide RP campaign

755
01:00:25,110 --> 01:00:29,689
We propose that that all retail
outlets charge a fee for plastic bags

756
01:00:30,048 --> 01:00:32,551
ahh, excuse me

757
01:00:33,551 --> 01:00:36,600
Mr. Minister
if you'll forgive me

758
01:00:37,422 --> 01:00:41,609
this sounds excellent, we'll return to it
please indulge me for one moment

759
01:00:42,894 --> 01:00:45,783
while soccer is usually their
favorite sport here...

760
01:00:46,131 --> 01:00:47,701
But things changed today

761
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:52,174
When a group of local kids reall took
to the Springboks in a surprise visit...

762
01:00:55,072 --> 01:00:55,948
See that?

763
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:59,340
That picture is worth any number
of speeches

764
01:01:22,266 --> 01:01:24,086
this is Johan Revelius

765
01:01:24,434 --> 01:01:26,493
Reporting live from Cape Town airport

766
01:01:26,837 --> 01:01:28,941
Where the Sprinboks' flight
has just landed

767
01:01:29,306 --> 01:01:32,742
the green and gold have just one week
to put the finishing touches

768
01:01:32,743 --> 01:01:34,734
to their grueling training program

769
01:01:35,179 --> 01:01:37,443
And I for one, must admit

770
01:01:37,814 --> 01:01:39,133
to being cautiosly optimistic

771
01:01:39,516 --> 01:01:41,609
I say cautiosly because

772
01:01:41,618 --> 01:01:43,722
in my humble opinion

773
01:01:44,054 --> 01:01:47,523
The Springbok team has
been over practised 

774
01:01:47,890 --> 01:01:50,597
on the field, and over committed 
off it

775
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:55,330
which makes beating a bower house
Austrailian side in next weeks opener

776
01:01:55,898 --> 01:01:57,047
a tall order

777
01:01:57,066 --> 01:01:59,999
Especially as this is an
inexperienced team

778
01:02:00,570 --> 01:02:02,868
with a history of coming up short
in big matches

779
01:02:03,272 --> 01:02:05,570
This is Live in Cape Town

780
01:02:05,608 --> 01:02:07,712
returning you to the
studio in Johannesburg

781
01:02:09,679 --> 01:02:11,067
around the world

782
01:02:11,681 --> 01:02:12,761
objectively

783
01:02:13,616 --> 01:02:16,278
What are they saying about our
chances to beat  Australia?

784
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:18,585
Everyone thinks they'll beat us

785
01:02:18,921 --> 01:02:22,550
And if they do we will have to go
through England and the rest

786
01:02:22,558 --> 01:02:23,889
just to get to the final

787
01:02:25,228 --> 01:02:26,764
so, it is very important

788
01:02:27,096 --> 01:02:28,586
that we beat Australia?

789
01:02:31,634 --> 01:02:32,339
Thank-you

790
01:02:45,146 --> 01:02:47,523
Mandela, the cabinet 
ministers are here

791
01:02:47,549 --> 01:02:49,847
to brief you on the trip to
Taiwan

792
01:02:50,151 --> 01:02:52,358
Yes, I'll be right out

793
01:03:37,765 --> 01:03:39,232
one week boys

794
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:53,562
want snipers on top of the stadium
and the surrounding buildings here

795
01:03:53,881 --> 01:03:54,893
No problem

796
01:03:55,249 --> 01:03:57,717
want those 2 approaches
completely sanitized

797
01:03:58,052 --> 01:04:02,314
2 approaches  -will decide where
he comes in at the last moment

798
01:04:03,524 --> 01:04:04,513
We want uniforms

799
01:04:05,125 --> 01:04:06,387
plain clothes

800
01:04:06,694 --> 01:04:08,093
sharp shooters

801
01:04:08,429 --> 01:04:09,873
And sniffer dogs

802
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:13,336
And if you need more men, we have
an army unit on standby

803
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:16,041
we are not going to take chances
gentlemen

804
01:04:17,037 --> 01:04:18,470
The President is going
to be exposed

805
01:04:20,407 --> 01:04:21,567
much too exposed

806
01:04:33,152 --> 01:04:34,460
Brenda

807
01:04:36,089 --> 01:04:37,397
I have been studying

808
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:40,600
for the summit in Taiwan?
good

809
01:04:41,661 --> 01:04:43,242
ahh, no, not exactly

810
01:04:44,497 --> 01:04:45,282
test me

811
01:04:46,766 --> 01:04:48,506
look like...

812
01:04:49,702 --> 01:04:53,035
block out their names, see if
I can recognize them

813
01:04:58,911 --> 01:04:59,775
Andre Joviur

814
01:05:00,847 --> 01:05:01,632
Kevin Johnson

815
01:05:03,483 --> 01:05:05,701
did I get them right?
yes Mandela

816
01:05:07,587 --> 01:05:09,714
that's the way I used 
to study in law school

817
01:05:11,257 --> 01:05:12,656
Unfortunately

818
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:15,393
Chester is far too easy
to identify

819
01:05:16,529 --> 01:05:17,951
But that will change

820
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:20,272
it must

821
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:36,680
team meeting, after dinner

822
01:05:50,061 --> 01:05:51,062
gather round

823
01:05:54,366 --> 01:05:56,311
what's this Francois,
homework?

824
01:05:57,235 --> 01:05:58,304
make sure everyone has got one

825
01:06:01,506 --> 01:06:02,621
What is this?

826
01:06:02,641 --> 01:06:05,178
We need to learn this song

827
01:06:05,210 --> 01:06:06,643
we can't just mouth the
words anymore

828
01:06:06,678 --> 01:06:08,748
nobody cares, as long as we're
winning the matches

829
01:06:08,814 --> 01:06:10,611
you're wrong, they do care

830
01:06:10,649 --> 01:06:13,026
it's their bloody song,
not ours

831
01:06:13,084 --> 01:06:15,211
flippin' terrorist song

832
01:06:15,253 --> 01:06:17,050
they used to arrest you for singing it

833
01:06:17,088 --> 01:06:19,261
now it's one of our anthems

834
01:06:19,291 --> 01:06:21,201
I can't even read it or
pronounce the words

835
01:06:23,861 --> 01:06:27,661
It's optional, take it if you want to

836
01:06:35,573 --> 01:06:39,191
It means, God bless Africa

837
01:06:40,578 --> 01:06:44,196
which, you have to admit,
we could use

838
01:06:55,493 --> 01:07:01,773
Tell us, Mr. President
Have you always been a rugby fan?

839
01:07:01,832 --> 01:07:08,772
ahh, people don't realize that I played
rugby myself when I was a student

840
01:07:09,573 --> 01:07:14,306
it's a very rough game, almost as
rough as politics

841
01:07:15,111 --> 01:07:19,093
How do you think the Springboks
will do?

842
01:07:19,148 --> 01:07:21,582
I think they will do very well

843
01:07:21,618 --> 01:07:24,667
Their level of commitment is tremendous

844
01:07:24,721 --> 01:07:30,819
now it's been said, you used to support
any team that played against the 'boks

845
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:34,045
yes, well obviously that is no longer true

846
01:07:34,063 --> 01:07:37,169
I am 100 % behind our boys

847
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:40,545
After all, if I can not change

848
01:07:40,603 --> 01:07:45,393
when circumstances demand it
How can I expect others to?

849
01:08:37,859 --> 01:08:40,521
Francois
Welcome, Mr. President

850
01:08:40,562 --> 01:08:45,044
Gentlemen, forgive me for
interupting your work

851
01:08:45,100 --> 01:08:47,751
the day before such an
important match

852
01:08:47,769 --> 01:08:52,536
but I just wanted to come and wish
good luck in person

853
01:08:52,608 --> 01:08:57,739
Sometimes, very seldom, as president
I'm allowed to do what I want

854
01:08:59,314 --> 01:09:04,013
Mr. President, this is...
Oh I  know who this is

855
01:09:04,052 --> 01:09:06,940
Andre, good luck

856
01:09:06,988 --> 01:09:09,639
Brendan, good luck to you

857
01:09:09,657 --> 01:09:13,593
Kevin, good luck
James, good luck

858
01:09:14,895 --> 01:09:16,374
Yapi, good luck

859
01:09:17,898 --> 01:09:22,392
did you ever imagine this?
how could I?

860
01:09:23,437 --> 01:09:25,234
Thank-you, good luck

861
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:27,034
Good luck

862
01:09:28,209 --> 01:09:30,746
Good luck to you
Good luck

863
01:09:31,746 --> 01:09:34,101
Good luck son

864
01:09:38,021 --> 01:09:41,852
but uh, where is Chester?

865
01:09:42,423 --> 01:09:46,484
he's injured sir, his hamstring

866
01:09:46,527 --> 01:09:48,688
we're trying to keep it quiet

867
01:09:48,729 --> 01:09:52,460
Well, will he be out 
for the entire tournament?

868
01:09:53,300 --> 01:09:56,849
with hamstrings, who knows

869
01:09:56,904 --> 01:10:00,657
we'll miss him
the whole country will miss him

870
01:10:02,409 --> 01:10:04,923
- Well gentlemen...
- Mr President

871
01:10:05,478 --> 01:10:07,446
this is for you, from us

872
01:10:14,054 --> 01:10:17,808
I am honored gentlemen,
truley honored

873
01:10:18,224 --> 01:10:24,299
and you must know that your
country supports you completely

874
01:10:25,265 --> 01:10:27,642
Good luck to you all
Thank-you sir

875
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:30,770
Francois, walk with me

876
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:35,838
I have something for you

877
01:10:39,179 --> 01:10:43,878
It has helped me through the years,
I hope it helps you

878
01:10:44,918 --> 01:10:47,557
Thank you Mr. President
Thank-you

879
01:10:59,898 --> 01:11:02,071
it's time for bed Dada

880
01:11:03,302 --> 01:11:05,896
ah, I'm going to stay  up for a while

881
01:11:05,938 --> 01:11:09,408
The country is excited tonight
you need to sleep

882
01:11:09,441 --> 01:11:10,624
The doctor said

883
01:11:11,477 --> 01:11:14,014
the doctor has no sense of vocation

884
01:11:55,286 --> 01:11:57,049
Thank-you

885
01:11:57,588 --> 01:11:59,954
Do you know what's the best
thing about you being the captain?

886
01:12:00,825 --> 01:12:02,087
um, the honor?

887
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:05,482
No, we don't have to share a room

888
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:08,647
no no no, I can't, I can't

889
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:11,816
I need to be really angry...
I know, it's working

890
01:12:11,836 --> 01:12:14,771
What is this?
 A poem

891
01:12:14,806 --> 01:12:16,683
from the President

892
01:12:16,741 --> 01:12:18,777
how does a poem help?

893
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:21,461
the same way your visit does,
inspiration

894
01:13:06,990 --> 01:13:09,140
what happened?
we scored

895
01:14:10,019 --> 01:14:13,703
We won!
we did?

896
01:14:39,280 --> 01:14:41,760
Very good


897
01:14:41,816 --> 01:14:44,319
What do you think?
Great, that was fantastic

898
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:08,035
you must be very happy.

899
01:15:08,076 --> 01:15:11,921
Any man would be happy dancing
with a beautiful lady like you

900
01:15:13,247 --> 01:15:16,182
Mr. President, you're
exaggerating

901
01:15:16,217 --> 01:15:22,076
not at all, my father was
a polygamist

902
01:15:22,123 --> 01:15:24,694
As you know, I am not

903
01:15:25,827 --> 01:15:29,796
but when I look at you,
I envy my father

904
01:16:22,381 --> 01:16:26,932
coaches room, 6 AM

905
01:16:28,988 --> 01:16:34,255
coaches room, 6 AM
6, drink up

906
01:16:35,494 --> 01:16:39,248
Jones, coaches room 6, 6 AM

907
01:17:17,936 --> 01:17:21,258
hey guys, I hope you're not going
to be this slow next week

908
01:17:22,140 --> 01:17:25,325
what's going on?
change of place

909
01:18:14,691 --> 01:18:17,922
that's what they used to do, smuggle
gravel in from the yard

910
01:18:17,961 --> 01:18:20,703
throw it across the floor so they
could hear the wardens come in

911
01:18:22,332 --> 01:18:26,405
can we see the President's cell?
yes, of course

912
01:18:28,338 --> 01:18:29,612
Can you believe this?

913
01:18:31,875 --> 01:18:35,891
the number on the door, 46664

914
01:18:35,946 --> 01:18:39,780
means he was the 466th prisioner
here in 1964

915
01:18:41,587 --> 01:18:43,587
we've done it up just the way it was

916
01:18:50,827 --> 01:18:52,704
Come with me

917
01:19:30,166 --> 01:19:33,920
Out of the night that covers me

918
01:19:33,970 --> 01:19:37,588
Black as the Pit from pole to pole

919
01:19:38,207 --> 01:19:44,760
I thank whatever gods may be
for my unconquerable soul

920
01:19:45,214 --> 01:19:49,856
In the fell clutch of circumstance

921
01:19:49,885 --> 01:19:53,889
I have not winced nor cried aloud

922
01:19:53,923 --> 01:20:01,886
Under the bludgeonings of chance
My head is bloody, but unbowed

923
01:20:01,896 --> 01:20:07,266
Beyond this place of wrath and tears

924
01:20:07,335 --> 01:20:11,374
Looms but the Horror of the shade

925
01:20:15,343 --> 01:20:20,792
And yet the menace of the years
Finds

926
01:20:20,815 --> 01:20:25,502
and shall find, me unafraid

927
01:20:26,154 --> 01:20:28,896
It matters not how strait the gate

928
01:20:29,929 --> 01:20:34,088
How charged with punishments the scroll

929
01:20:34,796 --> 01:20:43,682
I am the master of my fate
I am the captain of my soul

930
01:21:18,939 --> 01:21:20,554
Dada?
sir?

931
01:21:27,748 --> 01:21:29,306
What happened?

932
01:21:29,350 --> 01:21:33,229
simple exhaustion, but it will
lead to worse if it's not treated

933
01:21:33,287 --> 01:21:35,198
he needs a complete rest

934
01:21:35,255 --> 01:21:38,338
and I don't mean simply shifting
the affairs of state to his bedroom

935
01:21:38,926 --> 01:21:41,668
No phone calls, no meetings,
no visitors, no politics

936
01:21:41,729 --> 01:21:43,890
you know him, he won't do that

937
01:21:43,931 --> 01:21:46,183
then I'm going to put him into hospital,
in isolation

938
01:21:46,233 --> 01:21:49,212
no, not yet, I'll threaten him with
hopital if he doesn't behave

939
01:21:49,235 --> 01:21:50,827
I'll cancel everything

940
01:21:50,870 --> 01:21:53,156
and I'll come back tonight to make
sure he's not waking

941
01:21:56,109 --> 01:22:00,318
Don't cancel the trip to Taiwan,
not yet

942
01:22:16,896 --> 01:22:18,750
Chester's back

943
01:23:44,014 --> 01:23:46,027
Point for Green

944
01:24:10,407 --> 01:24:14,992
Mandela, this is the delegation who...
I know who this is

945
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:19,145
Welcome, thank-you for
coming so far to see me

946
01:24:19,183 --> 01:24:21,424
thank-you
how do you do?

947
01:24:21,485 --> 01:24:22,907
I'm fine, welcome
Thank you very much

948
01:24:22,953 --> 01:24:26,229
Ladies and gentlemen,
the game is delayed

949
01:24:33,796 --> 01:24:35,093
this is it, let's go

950
01:25:25,682 --> 01:25:28,855
International business alliances

951
01:25:28,884 --> 01:25:31,159
strong industries have
developed in shipping...

952
01:25:32,487 --> 01:25:36,298
um, please excuse me
yes Mr. President, of course

953
01:25:39,595 --> 01:25:42,837
Gentlemen, let us continue
in ten minutes

954
01:25:45,734 --> 01:25:48,225
This is good, very good

955
01:25:48,270 --> 01:25:50,238
so, who is our
next opponent?

956
01:25:50,272 --> 01:25:54,288
All Blacks play England tomorrow
then we'll know

957
01:25:54,309 --> 01:25:59,474
I see, you will make sure that my
schedule is free for the entire match

958
01:25:59,514 --> 01:26:02,472
oh yes Dada
 This is good

959
01:26:02,517 --> 01:26:04,519
This is very good

960
01:26:28,743 --> 01:26:31,564
Why do not we do a
little work while we're here?

961
01:26:33,447 --> 01:26:35,460
Just enjoy the rugby.

962
01:26:41,622 --> 01:26:43,522
so let me understand this

963
01:26:43,958 --> 01:26:46,700
the All Blacks are killing a team
that trashed us last year

964
01:26:46,727 --> 01:26:48,604
Thanks for reminding me.

965
01:26:54,902 --> 01:26:59,111
we're gonna really have to tackle 
against the English

966
01:27:06,547 --> 01:27:09,516
are those the judicial appointments
for the free states?

967
01:27:10,184 --> 01:27:12,505
they'll keep until after the match

968
01:27:14,989 --> 01:27:16,660
Here's the kick

969
01:27:17,424 --> 01:27:19,801
I am the president, you know

970
01:27:20,994 --> 01:27:23,428
And the conversion is good

971
01:27:24,264 --> 01:27:29,520
are you watching this guy?
he's about your size

972
01:27:30,203 --> 01:27:32,569
how much you suppose he weighs?
120 kilos -  Shit

973
01:27:32,605 --> 01:27:34,072
same as me

974
01:27:34,107 --> 01:27:36,086
Ya, but you're slow

975
01:27:38,011 --> 01:27:41,014
he looks or contact every time
he gets the ball

976
01:27:41,047 --> 01:27:43,265
yup
It's good for us

977
01:27:43,316 --> 01:27:48,663
I will break my arm, my leg, my neck,
but I will not let that guy go

978
01:27:49,656 --> 01:27:51,567
Well said
Well said

979
01:27:59,866 --> 01:28:01,436
...when you pass it
grab this

980
01:28:07,340 --> 01:28:08,739
Run!

981
01:28:14,413 --> 01:28:17,325
still think I'm wasting my
time with the rugby?

982
01:28:25,824 --> 01:28:27,633
he's in the clear
and he will...

983
01:28:28,026 --> 01:28:33,419
tell the minister of sport I would
like a full report on the All Blacks

984
01:28:34,533 --> 01:28:38,481
this rugby, it's still strictly
political?

985
01:28:38,537 --> 01:28:40,368
oh yes, oh yes
of course

986
01:28:49,300 --> 01:28:51,300
hello, hello
Francois...

987
01:28:54,853 --> 01:28:57,686
don't lose them, I won't
be able to get more

988
01:28:58,024 --> 01:29:00,024
thanks Francois

989
01:29:02,094 --> 01:29:06,406
Wait, there is a forth
who's that for?

990
01:29:24,515 --> 01:29:29,771
the All Blacks beat lreland 43 to 19 
I see

991
01:29:29,787 --> 01:29:33,575
they beat Wales  34 to 9 
I see

992
01:29:33,624 --> 01:29:40,541
they beat Japan 145 to 17
145 points in one match?

993
01:29:40,565 --> 01:29:43,045
It is a new international record

994
01:29:43,601 --> 01:29:47,093
they beat Scotland 48 to 13
in the quarter finals

995
01:29:47,138 --> 01:29:50,141
you saw the match with England
yes

996
01:29:50,741 --> 01:29:54,745
45 to 29, and it was
not that close

997
01:29:56,047 --> 01:29:58,595
They seem unstoppable

998
01:29:58,649 --> 01:30:03,620
If the opposing team plays them face up,
Lomo runs wild

999
01:30:03,653 --> 01:30:08,511
if they focus on Lomo, that leaves
others free. And then there's Hacca

1000
01:30:08,525 --> 01:30:15,235
a Maori war mask, yes,
it is very powerful

1001
01:30:15,799 --> 01:30:21,920
sources say half of the All Black matches
are won before the start because of it

1002
01:30:23,173 --> 01:30:25,232
How can we beat them?

1003
01:30:25,275 --> 01:30:29,279
I have the coaches number,
maybe you can call him and ask

1004
01:30:29,312 --> 01:30:34,488
no no, I don't want to distract their
focus, even for one minute

1005
01:30:35,819 --> 01:30:38,856
But how can we win?

1006
01:30:38,922 --> 01:30:42,506
Maybe we won't, they're favored 2 to 1


1007
01:30:43,660 --> 01:30:47,482
we've already exceeded all expectations
on and off the field

1008
01:30:47,530 --> 01:30:50,260
It is not enough, not now.

1009
01:30:50,767 --> 01:30:52,416
Not so close.

1010
01:30:54,003 --> 01:30:57,097
This country is hungry for greatness.

1011
01:31:17,626 --> 01:31:20,606
brought one of your Mom's
protien shakes

1012
01:31:25,701 --> 01:31:29,546
thinking about tomorrow?
no

1013
01:31:30,239 --> 01:31:35,379
tomorrow is taken care of
one way or another

1014
01:31:36,679 --> 01:31:41,981
I was thinking about how you
spend 30 years in a tiny cell

1015
01:31:43,652 --> 01:31:47,827
and come out ready to forgive the
people who put you in

1016
01:31:55,697 --> 01:31:59,053
Go home man, there's nothing
more you can do today

1017
01:32:03,638 --> 01:32:09,270
ever mentioned to you I hate the rugby?
once or twice, yes

1018
01:32:12,013 --> 01:32:16,256
I just want to get him through tomorrow
safely, that's all

1019
01:32:16,317 --> 01:32:18,729
we all do

1020
01:32:44,578 --> 01:32:48,639
the tickets sold out long before
the team became popular

1021
01:32:48,648 --> 01:32:53,003
there's not exactly going to be
the rainbow nation out there

1022
01:32:53,704 --> 01:32:55,000
and that's the reality

1023
01:32:55,777 --> 01:33:01,316
now all it takes is one idiot
trying to make a statement

1024
01:33:01,999 --> 01:33:06,776
Or one fool who thinks god is speaking
to him through the radio

1025
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:10,338
and it's happened before but not today

1026
01:33:10,404 --> 01:33:13,760
Not on our watch,
and not today

1027
01:34:04,757 --> 01:34:07,999
We are on the spot
on this historic day

1028
01:34:08,027 --> 01:34:13,249
where even this early, crowd
expectation is at fever pitch

1029
01:34:13,299 --> 01:34:20,683
because there beloved green and gold
has managed to defy all expectations

1030
01:34:20,739 --> 01:34:25,187
but now they come up against a team
unlike any they have faced before

1031
01:34:25,778 --> 01:34:30,806
these All Blacks are possibly one of
the greates international sides ever

1032
01:34:31,383 --> 01:34:37,617
with a player as dominant as any 
this correspondant has ever seen

1033
01:35:44,221 --> 01:35:47,713
final approach captain

1034
01:35:48,358 --> 01:35:51,001
let it be noted that I'm taking
control of the aircraft

1035
01:35:51,641 --> 01:35:53,000
duly noted

1036
01:35:54,498 --> 01:35:57,999
I take full responsibility for
what happens from now on

1037
01:36:17,788 --> 01:36:21,712
Do you see that jet to the east?

1038
01:36:22,592 --> 01:36:25,777
did they get clearance for this?
not from us

1039
01:36:28,464 --> 01:36:31,888
 Where is he?
VIP box

1040
01:36:31,934 --> 01:36:35,586
get him out of there, NOW
- No time

1041
01:37:01,264 --> 01:37:03,846
What the hell was that?

1042
01:37:44,739 --> 01:37:46,559
- A win
- Yes!

1043
01:37:48,243 --> 01:37:49,585
Come on!

1044
01:39:42,422 --> 01:39:48,543
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome the
President of the Republic of South Africa

1045
01:39:48,594 --> 01:39:51,233
Mr. Nelson Mandela

1046
01:40:01,039 --> 01:40:04,014
Dr. Nelson Mandela, the
President of South Africa

1047
01:40:04,608 --> 01:40:06,608
...in a rugby jersey with the
number 6 on his back...

1048
01:40:12,150 --> 01:40:16,189
Francois, your country is very
proud of you

1049
01:40:16,254 --> 01:40:18,393
- Thank you sir
- Good luck

1050
01:40:20,492 --> 01:40:23,063
Good luck son

1051
01:40:25,063 --> 01:40:26,599
Good luck son

1052
01:40:31,805 --> 01:40:33,805
(radio broadcast)

1053
01:40:35,140 --> 01:40:40,157
Chester I want you to know your whole
country is supporting you

1054
01:40:40,178 --> 01:40:42,180
Good luck
Thank you sir

1055
01:40:43,181 --> 01:40:44,523
Good luck son

1056
01:40:44,583 --> 01:40:49,566
...dramatic moments, I don't think I've
ever seen so many flags in one stadium

1057
01:40:59,506 --> 01:41:01,506
Hi
their captain

1058
01:41:02,060 --> 01:41:04,060
honored sir

1059
01:41:07,938 --> 01:41:10,918
 It is a pleasure
Nice to see you

1060
01:41:11,408 --> 01:41:12,989
I'm a little afraid of you

1061
01:41:19,116 --> 01:41:20,583
you all be careful now
thank-you

1062
01:41:28,724 --> 01:41:34,724
NELSON NELSON NELSON
NELSON NELSON NELSON

1063
01:41:36,145 --> 01:41:37,145
...Dr. Mandela just lifting his cap

1064
01:41:38,034 --> 01:41:40,999
to the 62 thousand people...

1065
01:41:55,952 --> 01:41:58,500
...wonderful aerial shot of...

1066
01:42:03,157 --> 01:42:22,157
(anthem singing)

1067
01:42:27,951 --> 01:42:30,772
The national anthem of South Africa

1068
01:42:32,388 --> 01:42:34,265
South Africa national anthems

1069
01:42:35,355 --> 01:43:05,355
(anthem singing)

1070
01:43:05,754 --> 01:43:08,279
...what an unbelievable spectacular
year in Johannesburg

1071
01:43:10,357 --> 01:43:46,357
(anthem continues)

1072
01:44:15,589 --> 01:44:16,965
Are you okay?

1073
01:44:16,957 --> 01:44:18,697
Here we go.

1074
01:44:21,896 --> 01:44:25,309
Maybe we should
make a little wager

1075
01:44:25,900 --> 01:44:30,701
All your gold,
 for all our sheep

1076
01:44:31,072 --> 01:44:36,589
I was thinking more along the lines
of a case of wine

1077
01:44:39,813 --> 01:44:44,409
The celebrations over, we now
come to the big game...

1078
01:44:54,828 --> 01:44:56,261
Come on!

1079
01:45:00,881 --> 01:45:25,885
(chanting)

1080
01:45:27,026 --> 01:45:31,519
...that's the Maori challenge, laid
down before going into battle...

1081
01:46:22,513 --> 01:46:24,515
Hey, get out of here

1082
01:46:36,460 --> 01:46:38,906
...knocked him down and stole the ball...

1083
01:46:40,464 --> 01:46:42,464
...put into play by New Zealand,
here's a chance on the outside...

1084
01:47:00,651 --> 01:47:02,460
huddle

1085
01:47:03,521 --> 01:47:07,127
what the heck are we doing?
Lomo is killing us

1086
01:47:08,693 --> 01:47:11,014
Foreward,
we must start scrumming

1087
01:47:11,062 --> 01:47:15,066
we must disrupt them at the first phase
we cannot allow Lomo the ball in space

1088
01:47:15,099 --> 01:47:19,000
he's freeking killing us,
but listen, if Lomo gets the ball...

1089
01:47:19,035 --> 01:47:24,294
Whoever is there, James, Yust,
hit the fucking guy, hold on to him

1090
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,685
help will come, 
help will be there

1091
01:47:43,806 --> 01:47:45,806
(whistles)

1092
01:48:08,518 --> 01:48:11,395
...they want to get the ball...

1093
01:48:12,488 --> 01:48:15,298
...most of the opportunities
have gone New Zealands way...

1094
01:48:15,791 --> 01:48:16,906
GO GO GO

1095
01:48:32,975 --> 01:48:33,964
listen up

1096
01:48:46,889 --> 01:48:49,198
first blood to New Zealand...

1097
01:50:03,797 --> 01:50:06,345
...an important kick for
New Zealand...

1098
01:50:14,307 --> 01:50:16,969
score for New Zealand

1099
01:50:17,811 --> 01:50:20,268
...score now New Zealand 6

1100
01:50:34,327 --> 01:50:35,316

1101
01:51:09,361 --> 01:51:10,350
BOOT IT

1102
01:51:14,364 --> 01:51:18,734
...South Africa in the lead
for the first time in the match...

1103
01:51:23,309 --> 01:51:25,277
Advantage for South Africa 9-6...

1104
01:52:00,778 --> 01:52:02,928
Scoring New Zealand

1105
01:52:37,215 --> 01:52:39,513
Half time

1106
01:52:39,551 --> 01:52:41,428
unsuccessful kick, the score
remains 9 - 9

1107
01:52:42,001 --> 01:52:47,007
that's the closing score 9 all,
there will now be a 5 minute break...

1108
01:52:57,434 --> 01:53:00,085
so, what does this mean?

1109
01:53:00,137 --> 01:53:02,560
extra time, 20 minutes

1110
01:53:03,607 --> 01:53:05,222
I don't think I can take it

1111
01:53:06,091 --> 01:53:08,091
...be a test of great character...

1112
01:53:12,316 --> 01:53:16,728
who's the greatest team on this field?
who's the greatest team on this field?

1113
01:54:15,678 --> 01:54:19,669
New Zealand 12
South Africa 9

1114
01:54:42,203 --> 01:54:43,909
penalty against green

1115
01:54:53,515 --> 01:54:58,361
too many guys off their feet
speak to your team

1116
01:55:06,996 --> 01:55:09,540
Heads up,
look in my eyes

1117
01:55:11,266 --> 01:55:14,394
Do you hear?
listen to the country

1118
01:55:15,203 --> 01:55:18,013
7 minutes, 7 minutes

1119
01:55:18,039 --> 01:55:21,566
Defense, defense, defense
This is it!

1120
01:55:21,643 --> 01:55:24,476
This is our destiny,
Go!

1121
01:55:30,884 --> 01:55:34,644
How long?
7 minutes

1122
01:56:26,639 --> 01:56:30,018
...an important kick...

1123
01:56:40,156 --> 01:56:42,156
YEAH!

1124
01:56:50,663 --> 01:56:53,223
tie score

1125
01:56:59,205 --> 01:57:00,604
Now, now!

1126
01:57:42,380 --> 01:57:44,029
...can hear the big man coming...

1127
01:58:16,614 --> 01:58:17,603
Now!

1128
01:58:46,277 --> 01:58:47,266
...has he got 'em?

1129
01:59:31,120 --> 01:59:36,205
...great play there...

1130
02:00:46,386 --> 02:00:48,386
(whistle)

1131
02:01:52,792 --> 02:01:54,589
Chester, will you lead us
in a prayer?

1132
02:01:55,128 --> 02:01:58,484
thanks god, for getting us into this final

1133
02:01:58,531 --> 02:02:03,195
thanks for no serious injuries, and
most of all, thanks for the win

1134
02:02:03,236 --> 02:02:04,874
Amen
Amen

1135
02:03:38,796 --> 02:03:40,855
Francois
a few words?

1136
02:03:43,100 --> 02:03:50,381
Great game, but you couldn't have done
it without the support of the 63,000 here

1137
02:03:51,042 --> 02:03:54,876
Ya, we didn't need the support of 
60 thousand South Africans

1138
02:03:54,946 --> 02:03:57,767
we had the support of 43 million
South Africans

1139
02:04:12,964 --> 02:04:16,661
I have to thank-you for what
you have done for our country

1140
02:04:16,701 --> 02:04:20,341
No Mr. President, thank you
for what you have done for our country

1141
02:05:55,564 --> 02:05:58,874
this route is crowded
let's change to conceal

1142
02:06:01,303 --> 02:06:04,079
There's no hurry

1143
02:06:04,640 --> 02:06:06,278
No hurry at all

1144
02:06:08,310 --> 02:06:10,847
Mandela says there's no need to hurry

1145
02:06:21,824 --> 02:06:27,739
I thank whatever gods may be
for my unconquerable soul

1146
02:06:28,396 --> 02:06:31,957
I am the master my fate

1147
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:35,299
I'm the captain of my soul.
