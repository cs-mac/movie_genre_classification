00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:31,900
I've always had lots
of dreams when I sleep.

4
00:00:33,633 --> 00:00:39,675
The dreams have always
been about the future.

5
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:46,517
The future in my dreams
was always bright.

6
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:50,991
A future brimming

7
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:54,758
with hope and peace.

8
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,863
So I've always loved to sleep.

9
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:05,035
That is, until just recently...

10
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:07,369
Arita... and Nimura,
listen up.

11
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:11,442
My daughter's new
desk is outside.

12
00:02:11,564 --> 00:02:15,205
Could you guys deliver it
to my house? My back's out.

13
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,008
Sure.

14
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:33,463
Oh, watch out for the banister.

15
00:02:33,586 --> 00:02:34,860
Sorry.

16
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:37,262
Look, honey,
you can lock the drawer.

17
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,667
And you can adjust the chair.

18
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:42,101
It'll last until college.

19
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:44,265
Isn't it better by the window?

20
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:45,569
You think?

21
00:03:01,281 --> 00:03:02,419
It's not great.

22
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,061
I still like it better by the window.

23
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,574
What's your hobby, Arita?

24
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,704
I don't really have any.

25
00:03:24,837 --> 00:03:28,216
I see.
And you, Nimura?

26
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,717
Music appreciation.

27
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:33,619
What kind of music?

28
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:34,986
Anything.

29
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:38,220
Anything? Like what?

30
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,331
Any kind.

31
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:42,023
Any kind, huh?

32
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,397
Did you notice?

33
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:52,573
The roast pork's home made.

34
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:58,647
I spice it differently
from the store-bought kind.

35
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:08,484
Can I borrow one?

36
00:04:09,716 --> 00:04:12,128
A CD, one that you like.

37
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,062
Yeah, sure.

38
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,945
What?

39
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:37,917
Could be a storm's coming.

40
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:39,248
What?

41
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,751
Just a hunch.

42
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:27,461
I'm going to pay you a special bonus.

43
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:29,664
Who me?

44
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,571
Yeah, you and Arita.

45
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:35,012
Three months pay, for now.

46
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:36,340
Thank you.

47
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:40,508
And I'd like to sign you guys on
as full-time employees.

48
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,314
Think it over.

49
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:47,390
Yes.

50
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,225
Oh, and that CD.

51
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,094
What?

52
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:56,791
The one I wanted.

53
00:05:56,923 --> 00:05:57,958
Oh.

54
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,093
Got one on you now?

55
00:06:00,226 --> 00:06:02,365
Yeah, I do.

56
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:10,509
Your employment contract.
Look it over.

57
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:12,411
Your seal.

58
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:20,156
What are you going to do?

59
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,917
Haven't decided yet.

60
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:27,425
We'll get a raise...
what should I do?

61
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,122
Decide for yourself.

62
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:33,362
Nothing changes, if we become
full-time employees, right?

63
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:37,234
I hope not.

64
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,939
Maybe I'll sign on.

65
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:45,745
What have you been
dreaming lately?

66
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:49,251
What? Nothing.

67
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,924
Better trust your dreams.

68
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:57,625
I'm telling you I don't have any.

69
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:00,697
Maybe that's just as well.

70
00:07:18,504 --> 00:07:20,677
It's not eating.

71
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:29,556
Hey, what are you doing!
Watch out, watch it.

72
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:32,356
You're mocking
the jellyfish's venom.

73
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,123
It's really dangerous.

74
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:37,496
But you've never touched it either,
Mamoru san.

75
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:40,201
'Cause I don't want to die.

76
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:42,465
You've gotta watch out, man.

77
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:04,286
I think I'll go home, now.

78
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:05,862
Sure.

79
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,536
Don't go crazy, okay, Nimura.

80
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,904
Yeah.

81
00:08:20,032 --> 00:08:21,602
Just be cool.

82
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:24,672
I know.

83
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,080
Right now, I think that's best.

84
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,653
I said, I know.

85
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:38,895
You're late.

86
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,123
Oh, hi.

87
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:46,263
You look like a slob, brother.
I told you to dress nice.

88
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:46,961
Shut up.

89
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:49,539
Shall we go, brother?

90
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:53,635
Ken, stop calling
my brother "brother"...

91
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:57,578
You're the same age.
Just call him Yuji.

92
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,707
But...
Right?

93
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,841
Call me anything.

94
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,945
Welcome.
A party of three?

95
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:05,885
Yes.
You take Visa?

96
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:08,618
Yes, we do.
Follow me.

97
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:12,753
You've got to eat
your vegetables, brother.

98
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:13,795
Shut up.

99
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:18,027
Let's go get some coffee.

100
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:20,831
Yeah, let's.

101
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,237
Is there a coffee place
around here?

102
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:27,776
Let's go to an arcade instead.

103
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,107
Forget it.

104
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,772
It's pretty fun.

105
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,212
An arcade?

106
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:37,151
My treat, this time.
Let's go.

107
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:40,284
C'mon, we're going.

108
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,147
I won.

109
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:09,584
Let's play again.

110
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:32,675
Sorry.
I'm pretty good at this stuff.

111
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:37,479
Why are you so pissed off?
What an idiot. Let's go.

112
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:38,877
Yeah.

113
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:02,034
Nimura, here's the plan.

114
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:07,372
When I do this, it means "wait."
And this means "go ahead."

115
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,706
Okay?

116
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:09,938
What's that?

117
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,810
It's a signal.

118
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:14,975
You're always getting confused.

119
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:18,316
And then you don't have a clue
which way you're going.

120
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,720
So I'll signal you.

121
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,689
Forget it.

122
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,692
Cut it out.

123
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:32,292
No, let's give it a try.

124
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:37,170
This is "wait,"
and this is "go ahead." It's good.

125
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:43,370
I think it's pretty good.

126
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:45,345
Don't bug me.

127
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,398
Oh, hello.

128
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,274
Good timing.
You're both here.

129
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,070
Yes.

130
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:17,909
Thought you'd like some sushi.

131
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,812
Thanks.

132
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,050
Say guys, listen.

133
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:33,994
I just happen to be 55, now.

134
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,423
How old are you guys?

135
00:12:37,556 --> 00:12:42,301
I'm 27 and Nimura's 24.

136
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,999
You're so young.

137
00:12:45,131 --> 00:12:48,635
But you just happen
to be that age, right?

138
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:53,807
I really wish you guys
could've met him.

139
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:59,218
Me, as a 25 year-old.

140
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:02,417
I was really something else.

141
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,597
Back in the early '70s.

142
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,128
I sure had guts back then.

143
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,233
Everyone did, back then.

144
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:18,137
Goals, that what you call them?

145
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,877
We all had clear goals back then.

146
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,810
Of course now,
it seems ridiculous.

147
00:13:23,936 --> 00:13:25,415
Oh, no.

148
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,045
The thing is...

149
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:33,350
I can't remember.

150
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,085
What was that, anyway?

151
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:45,333
Hey, it was no big deal
even back then.

152
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:48,131
I've clean forgotten it.

153
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,305
Guess that's what
it means to be young.

154
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:57,707
What?

155
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:01,918
Excuse me.

156
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,081
What's wrong, man?

157
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,223
Right now, it's this.

158
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:29,804
- Is he okay?
- Yes, he's fine.

159
00:14:32,838 --> 00:14:35,910
Oh, look at the time.
You got satellite TV?

160
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,076
Yeah, I do.

161
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,688
Let's see.

162
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,925
Is this it?

163
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,691
Yeah, this is it.

164
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:07,242
Great.

165
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,410
Come cheer with me.

166
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,353
You can really get into it.

167
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,166
Go, go, Japan.

168
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,568
You really do get into it.

169
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:54,388
Oh, look at the time.

170
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:56,959
Hey.

171
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,297
Is that a tropical fish?

172
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,839
It's a jellyfish,
a Red Jellyfish.

173
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,772
Wow.

174
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:09,546
It won't sting, will it?

175
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,810
Hey, that's danger...

176
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:30,795
Come here, come here.

177
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:17,573
Hello.
Hey, Nimura, it's me.

178
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:23,176
No, no, I was just thinking.
How'd you like to have the jellyfish?

179
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:25,049
That's right.

180
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:30,154
Who me?
No, I think it's time to move on.

181
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,116
Here's the thermometer.

182
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,313
Right.

183
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:03,860
Take a cup of saltwater out
everyday.

184
00:18:03,982 --> 00:18:07,361
And replace it with fresh water.

185
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:12,834
This guy's special,
so don't forget, okay?

186
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:19,739
- Promise, okay?
- Sure.

187
00:18:36,348 --> 00:18:38,055
Go ahead.

188
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,621
Wait.

189
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:46,629
Go ahead, go ahead.

190
00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:00,377
It never reacts at all.

191
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,980
That's just its nature.

192
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,856
I'm sure you two
will get along fine.

193
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:39,990
When I looked up that jellyfish,
I found out it was poisonous.

194
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,523
But he never let me know.

195
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:48,392
He was going to let it kill me.

196
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:52,800
When I called him on it,
he said he would quit.

197
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:58,765
I don't have a clue
what he was thinking.

198
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,938
You in it with him?

199
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:10,009
Come to my office.
I'll give you that bonus, in cash.

200
00:20:52,985 --> 00:21:00,985
Bowling Alley Closed

201
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:23,749
No way.

202
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:27,820
He's got it.
Gotta go get it back.

203
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:21,623
How was he?

204
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:26,429
Well, I just had a visit with Mamoru.

205
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:31,371
I must admit, his confession
seems unimpeachable.

206
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:36,943
Which means his chances
of acquittal are slim.

207
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:39,446
You do understand?

208
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:41,346
Yes.

209
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:45,917
Of course, I'll do everything I can,

210
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:51,323
but I think you should prepare
yourself, in a way.

211
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,624
Yes.

212
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:07,306
Are you okay?

213
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:09,601
I'm sorry.

214
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:14,078
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

215
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,910
As far as "preparing
myself, in a way,"

216
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:23,186
what do you mean by that?
I'm not sure what you mean.

217
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:26,387
Yes, I understand.

218
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:32,201
In any event, leave the legal end
of things to me.

219
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:37,569
The most important thing you can do
is to gather information.

220
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:45,547
Because your son may tell you things
he would never mention to me.

221
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:48,173
Oh, yes.

222
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:57,656
Can you contact your wife?

223
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,318
More or less.

224
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,261
Then, please let her know.

225
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:04,296
Yes.

226
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:09,035
So, when do you plan
to visit him?

227
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,605
What?

228
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:15,269
Your son?
When shall I arrange a visit?

229
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:20,580
Right.

230
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:25,311
It's too late today, but what
about tomorrow afternoon?

231
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:26,615
Yes.

232
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:28,315
In that case...

233
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:33,792
Don't worry.
I won't accompany you.

234
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:35,261
Oh?

235
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:40,564
I think it's better not to discuss
the incident at first.

236
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:43,129
Oh, boy.

237
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:44,740
What?

238
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:48,204
What should I talk about, then?

239
00:27:49,734 --> 00:27:51,145
Just try to act normal.

240
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:55,615
Well, you see...

241
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:56,810
Yes?

242
00:27:56,941 --> 00:28:00,548
I haven't seen my son in five years.

243
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,353
So the thing is,

244
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:08,157
I'll be fine, but I'm not sure

245
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:13,469
whether he'll really want to see me.
That's what I'm...

246
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:19,831
Mr. Arita,
how can you say that?

247
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,742
Did I say something wrong?

248
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,577
Yes, you did.

249
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:32,780
You have to visit him.
He's your son.

250
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:35,985
It's your duty.

251
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:38,652
Yes.

252
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:44,890
It doesn't have to be tomorrow,
but as soon as you can, okay?

253
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:46,525
Yes.

254
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:54,533
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

255
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:23,204
Shocked?
Of course, you're shocked, right?

256
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:28,073
I just kind of did it.
And look at me now.

257
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,942
Cops are scary.

258
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:36,382
I was back at home, farting around,
and the cops came right away.

259
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:39,045
I wonder who reported it.

260
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,017
Don't tell me it was you.

261
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:47,625
Just kidding.

262
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:52,666
I guess it's a relief
to get caught right away,

263
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:56,398
instead of running yourself ragged
trying to escape.

264
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:00,234
You okay?

265
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:05,009
How could I be?

266
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,309
You have a good point.

267
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:11,011
Why didn't you tell me?

268
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,281
Sorry.

269
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:22,930
I went, too, right after.

270
00:30:23,054 --> 00:30:26,331
To get my CD back.

271
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:27,800
I should've killed them first.

272
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,097
Shut up!

273
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:35,671
When I say "wait," you wait.
Did you forget?

274
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,212
So, it's "wait."

275
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,944
Sorry.

276
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,562
Hey, how's that jellyfish doing?

277
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,900
What? Don't know.

278
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:06,338
"Don't know" is not good enough.

279
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:11,174
He's still a baby.
He won't make it without you.

280
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:12,645
Yeah.

281
00:31:12,937 --> 00:31:15,508
You take good care of him, now.

282
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,119
Yeah.

283
00:31:18,009 --> 00:31:19,647
I'm counting on you.

284
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,219
I know.

285
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:28,493
Remember that kid, Yoshida?

286
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:32,567
He's getting married.

287
00:31:34,325 --> 00:31:38,535
His bride's just a clerk,

288
00:31:38,663 --> 00:31:43,408
but he's lucky he found anyone.

289
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:50,518
Oh, that's right, remember,

290
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:56,649
your aunt in lwate? She's selling
her fields to build apartments.

291
00:31:56,781 --> 00:32:01,560
It's the middle of nowhere,
so they won't be very impressive.

292
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:05,496
Wonder if she'll pull it off.

293
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:10,337
And then...

294
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,472
Don't bother.

295
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,536
Right.

296
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:24,814
I think I'll be here
another 5 or 10 years,

297
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,945
so come and visit sometimes.

298
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:31,157
Yeah, yeah.

299
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:37,494
Thanks for coming today.
I'm glad I got to see you.

300
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,123
Yeah.

301
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:47,200
The red-eyed scorpion

302
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:53,816
The spread-winged eagle

303
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:58,217
The blue-eyed puppy

304
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:04,053
The coiled-up snake

305
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:08,628
5 to 10 years is out of the question.

306
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:11,256
At minimum he'll get life,

307
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:13,835
if he doesn't get death.

308
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:19,472
I think your son knows this,
all too well.

309
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:28,583
Mr. Arita,

310
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:34,885
when I talked about
"preparing yourself, in a way,"

311
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:37,186
this is what I was getting at.

312
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:58,013
I'm thinking about quitting.

313
00:33:59,237 --> 00:34:04,380
Frankly, there's no future
in this line of work.

314
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,823
Sorry.

315
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:17,832
RECYCLING AND REPAIRS

316
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:26,097
Mom's not coming, after all.
She called.

317
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,076
Welcome.

318
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:33,045
How about a beer, Fuyuki?

319
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:35,981
No thanks.
I'll take a coffee.

320
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:42,148
Sorry to drag you here suddenly.

321
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,386
How's work? Busy?

322
00:34:45,516 --> 00:34:47,496
No...

323
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,494
I read about my brother in the paper.

324
00:34:56,227 --> 00:34:58,468
TV reporters bugging you?

325
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,803
Just once.

326
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:05,380
They're a pain, a real pain.

327
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:06,675
Yeah.

328
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:12,446
So, what's up?

329
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,752
What's up?

330
00:35:14,879 --> 00:35:17,052
Oh, the thing is,

331
00:35:17,181 --> 00:35:21,630
I thought maybe we should
all get together, once.

332
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:22,924
Huh.

333
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:27,569
Not like
a family meeting or anything,

334
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:31,697
but we should talk
about the future and such.

335
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:36,905
Listen, you talk about the future,

336
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:38,980
but your future
and mine are different.

337
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:41,606
Yes, I know that.

338
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:44,845
Besides, I'm not an Arita anymore.

339
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:51,317
Right...
You took your mother's name...

340
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,626
You need money for the lawyer?

341
00:35:55,753 --> 00:36:00,862
No, no.
I can manage his legal expenses.

342
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,598
Hmm, so you're rich, now?

343
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:06,208
Of course not.

344
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:10,976
Lucky you. I'm jealous.

345
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:16,578
Are you hard up for cash?

346
00:36:16,707 --> 00:36:21,781
Of course, I am. I want all kinds
of stuff, but there's no money.

347
00:36:23,214 --> 00:36:25,387
Here you are.

348
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,672
Fuyuki,

349
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:42,537
it's hardly my place to say this,

350
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:45,341
but you can talk to me about things.

351
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:48,450
About anything, okay?

352
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:52,544
I'll do the best I can for you.

353
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:55,590
Loan me 10 million yen, then?

354
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:56,851
10 million?

355
00:36:56,981 --> 00:37:00,258
I'm going to buy an apartment.
The down payment.

356
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:04,992
10 million, huh...
That'll take me a while.

357
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:06,795
I need it now.

358
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:08,267
That's impossible.

359
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:13,867
But, I'll manage.

360
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:15,909
You will?

361
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:20,372
Well, I'm not sure.

362
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,907
Forget it, then. I don't need it.

363
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:27,921
Frankly, money's tight for me, too.

364
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,690
Then don't say
you'll do the best you can.

365
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:39,191
That's it?

366
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:41,898
That's all you wanted to talk about?

367
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:44,506
I'm off, then.

368
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:49,101
No, I'll get it.

369
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,107
Really?

370
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:55,849
Oh, I should've ordered cake.

371
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:11,024
I'll be right back.

372
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:19,400
What?

373
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,838
Fuyuki,

374
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:25,940
Just what kind of person
was Mamoru?

375
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:30,212
How should I know?
Ask him.

376
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:34,416
Well, you've got a point.

377
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:38,817
Figure things out for yourself.

378
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,426
You're only giving it brine shrimp?

379
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,233
Yeah.

380
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:50,900
I told you that's no good.

381
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:54,532
Every third feeding has to be
chopped fish or whitebait.

382
00:38:57,201 --> 00:38:58,043
Yeah.

383
00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:00,541
And the brine shrimp.

384
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:04,676
They're only good for 12 hours
after they hatch, so don't wait.

385
00:39:06,577 --> 00:39:11,617
Oh, and also mysis.
You can buy mysis at a pet shop.

386
00:39:11,749 --> 00:39:14,229
Give it those, too, if you can.

387
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:16,121
Mysis?

388
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:21,096
And in four or five days,

389
00:39:21,225 --> 00:39:25,674
let's try reducing the salinity
to 1.015.

390
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,605
You sure you're alive?

391
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,773
You sure you're not dead?

392
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:13,275
Really?
So the salinity's down to 1.01.

393
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,615
Excellent.

394
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:21,716
Let's decrease the temperature
to 15 degrees centigrade.

395
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:25,259
Try doing it gradually,
over three or four days.

396
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:30,593
Wow, that jellyfish is adapting
to fresh water.

397
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:36,635
You're my only hope.
You've got to monitor it carefully.

398
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,263
I'm counting on you.

399
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:41,204
Sure.

400
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:50,448
What's wrong?

401
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:53,614
Sick of it?

402
00:41:54,144 --> 00:41:55,521
No.

403
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:57,421
Then what is it?

404
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:06,362
I've decided to wait, after all.

405
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:11,064
10 years or even 20.
I'm going to wait for you.

406
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,475
After that,

407
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:18,444
we can do all this stuff together.

408
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:20,879
It won't be too late, will it?

409
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:27,920
You're the one who knows
all about the future.

410
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:32,516
You mean, my dreams?
Forget them.

411
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:37,099
I've made up my mind.
I'll wait 20 years for you.

412
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,929
No matter what,
my mind's made up.

413
00:42:42,626 --> 00:42:47,006
Then it's all over.
Do whatever you want.

414
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:51,744
Don't come here anymore.
If you do, I won't even see you.

415
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:56,249
We're finished.
I'm disappointed in you.

416
00:42:56,373 --> 00:43:01,118
Do whatever the hell you want.
Count me out.

417
00:43:02,146 --> 00:43:04,092
Hey, hey, wait.

418
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,153
Just wait.

419
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:11,262
Mamoru san, wait.

420
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:14,536
Hey, wait!

421
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:23,734
It's your fault.

422
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:26,297
Hey.

423
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:31,879
I didn't come for any
special reason today.

424
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:38,010
Guess I wanted to see your face.

425
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:47,058
You're looking well.
I'm relieved.

426
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:55,731
But spending day after day
in this place,

427
00:44:55,859 --> 00:45:01,741
must be pretty boring.
What do you do every day?

428
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:04,575
Think.

429
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:06,841
About what?

430
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:07,744
What do you think?

431
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,009
What?

432
00:45:09,139 --> 00:45:11,585
About my execution.

433
00:45:35,466 --> 00:45:37,070
I'm sorry.

434
00:45:37,434 --> 00:45:42,611
Tell them to get it over with.
Submit a petition or something.

435
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:50,017
You're the one who asked me
what I think about.

436
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:54,027
I just told you what I think about.

437
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,456
See you.

438
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:42,993
Wow!

439
00:49:53,056 --> 00:49:56,367
Actually, it was really me
they should've caught.

440
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:00,801
Mamoru san went ahead and did it,

441
00:50:00,931 --> 00:50:06,847
so I couldn't.
That's what I think.

442
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:08,943
I see.

443
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:14,747
But he never said anything

444
00:50:14,878 --> 00:50:18,121
about why he did it.

445
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:23,556
I see.
But you know,

446
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:28,329
he went away,
leaving his mystery behind.

447
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:32,031
But something tells me
he's on the other side,

448
00:50:32,162 --> 00:50:36,542
getting a total kick out
of how he stumped us.

449
00:50:39,002 --> 00:50:44,213
All right.
See you somewhere, Nimura, I'm off.

450
00:50:51,648 --> 00:50:56,688
Nimura, I wanted to ask you.

451
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:00,698
What do you think this means?

452
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:05,670
They say Mamoru died like this.

453
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:13,806
Another mystery, huh?
That's just the kind of guy he was.

454
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:39,267
These three.

455
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:59,484
Will you hold them down
until the next stop?

456
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:00,754
Yes.

457
00:52:40,457 --> 00:52:42,095
What?

458
00:52:43,126 --> 00:52:45,163
There's a jellyfish.

459
00:52:45,295 --> 00:52:47,036
A jellyfish?

460
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:49,432
Yes, somewhere.

461
00:52:49,566 --> 00:52:52,513
You mean that jellyfish?

462
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:29,441
Nimura, about that
jellyfish you mentioned,

463
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:32,179
what was that about?

464
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:39,051
I inherited Mamoru's pet jellyfish.

465
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:44,695
But I let it escape.

466
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:47,961
I know it's somewhere,
here in Tokyo.

467
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:50,970
Don't jellyfish need saltwater?

468
00:53:52,762 --> 00:53:57,939
We acclimated it to fresh water
so it could survive in Tokyo.

469
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:05,480
I see...

470
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:17,529
You don't believe me, do you?

471
00:54:19,623 --> 00:54:23,594
It's not that I don't believe you.

472
00:54:23,727 --> 00:54:28,369
I just don't get why it matters.

473
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:33,537
That's because you've
never seen this jellyfish.

474
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:36,251
No, I haven't.

475
00:54:37,073 --> 00:54:40,782
Mamoru never used
to care about them, either.

476
00:54:41,978 --> 00:54:45,687
And there was nothing
about it among his things.

477
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:49,622
And that's all I really know.

478
00:55:07,704 --> 00:55:08,808
We're here.

479
00:55:11,841 --> 00:55:13,320
See you.

480
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:15,548
Thanks.

481
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:53,118
Morning.

482
00:55:53,249 --> 00:55:54,592
Good morning.

483
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,765
What's that?

484
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:08,068
Brine shrimp.

485
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:09,472
What?

486
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,340
Jellyfish food.

487
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:13,912
I'm borrowing this.

488
00:56:20,577 --> 00:56:26,823
Listen, is this really
what Mamoru was up to?

489
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:27,985
Yes.

490
00:56:28,651 --> 00:56:30,062
Plastic containers.

491
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:49,050
You'd better stay out of the way.

492
00:57:15,398 --> 00:57:16,604
Let's go.

493
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:37,489
Time to go, now.

494
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,730
Rain's letting up.

495
00:58:29,405 --> 00:58:30,509
What are you doing?

496
00:58:46,322 --> 00:58:49,735
It's here, in here.

497
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:22,734
Let's go.

498
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,871
It has stopped raining.

499
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:09,593
Have a bad dream?

500
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:15,000
What's wrong?

501
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:22,644
Sometimes,

502
01:02:22,772 --> 01:02:26,083
I can see the future in my dreams.

503
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:29,953
I've always been that way.

504
01:02:32,115 --> 01:02:34,561
I don't know why.

505
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:40,329
But for a while, now,

506
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:43,464
I've hardly dreamt at all.

507
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:48,770
And when I did, it was just darkness.

508
01:02:52,068 --> 01:02:54,947
Then today, I had a clear one.

509
01:03:00,877 --> 01:03:02,686
I wonder where I was.

510
01:03:04,547 --> 01:03:06,788
I don't know where I was,

511
01:03:08,651 --> 01:03:12,793
but I was walking
in a forest or a desert.

512
01:03:15,858 --> 01:03:18,896
A ferocious wind was blowing.

513
01:03:21,831 --> 01:03:24,368
The road went on,

514
01:03:26,435 --> 01:03:29,245
but I couldn't see
where I was going.

515
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:33,851
I was all alone.

516
01:03:36,112 --> 01:03:42,358
Everyone else
seems to have left.

517
01:03:45,888 --> 01:03:48,334
The wind was so intense,

518
01:03:50,059 --> 01:03:52,835
I couldn't open my eyes,

519
01:03:54,096 --> 01:03:57,236
and I had to lean into it.

520
01:04:02,104 --> 01:04:05,051
I wonder where I was going.

521
01:04:08,211 --> 01:04:10,748
I'll make a pot of coffee.

522
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:15,859
It will wake you right up.

523
01:04:37,473 --> 01:04:38,178
What's wrong?

524
01:04:40,243 --> 01:04:41,586
It's broken.

525
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:45,120
The shrimps are dead.

526
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:46,955
You're right.

527
01:04:53,256 --> 01:04:55,361
Hey, did you do something?

528
01:04:55,491 --> 01:04:59,997
Me? Why would I do anything?

529
01:05:00,863 --> 01:05:02,501
I have to start over.

530
01:05:05,768 --> 01:05:07,441
Please lend me some money.

531
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,413
Hey, Nimura.

532
01:05:11,107 --> 01:05:13,951
I need money.
Can't you see that?

533
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:19,284
200,000, even 100,000
yen would do.

534
01:05:21,117 --> 01:05:23,461
Calm down and think it through.

535
01:05:29,825 --> 01:05:32,465
How do you open it!

536
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:47,081
Stop it!
That's enough!

537
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:56,191
Nimura.

538
01:05:58,554 --> 01:06:01,933
In this world, there are things

539
01:06:02,058 --> 01:06:04,834
you can do,
and things you can't.

540
01:06:06,562 --> 01:06:10,908
You're all wrong if you think
you can do anything you want.

541
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:16,974
I saw the jellyfish, I really did.
It was beautiful.

542
01:06:17,506 --> 01:06:21,921
But what's going to come of it?
Will it change reality?

543
01:06:22,845 --> 01:06:26,315
Will it help you get what you want?

544
01:06:26,849 --> 01:06:29,955
How should I know?
Leave me alone.

545
01:06:30,086 --> 01:06:33,124
What'll happen to you
if I leave you alone?

546
01:06:34,256 --> 01:06:36,361
Leave me alone!

547
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:40,669
I can't.
Not anymore.

548
01:06:41,797 --> 01:06:46,473
You really frustrate me.
Why don't you try

549
01:06:46,602 --> 01:06:49,344
looking at what's
right in front of you? Huh?

550
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:53,386
Why can't you try
facing this reality?

551
01:06:56,178 --> 01:07:00,126
Because it's scruffy and filthy?

552
01:07:00,249 --> 01:07:02,729
Well, that's insulting.

553
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:07,961
Because this reality also
happens to be my reality.

554
01:07:08,090 --> 01:07:12,664
You have no right to treat it
with such contempt, you fool!

555
01:07:15,564 --> 01:07:19,444
You're going to run?
Run, then.

556
01:07:19,802 --> 01:07:22,078
But where can you run to?

557
01:07:23,272 --> 01:07:26,048
Nimura, where can you run?

558
01:07:28,411 --> 01:07:32,882
You'll only end up in one
of two places if you run.

559
01:07:34,784 --> 01:07:39,790
Either inside your dreams,
or inside a prison.

560
01:07:39,922 --> 01:07:41,560
Got that?

561
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:54,879
Isn't it about time
you figured that out?

562
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:19,035
I was too harsh.
I didn't mean it.

563
01:08:19,161 --> 01:08:22,074
Nimura, please wait.

564
01:08:22,865 --> 01:08:24,003
Nimura.

565
01:08:26,735 --> 01:08:28,078
Nimura.

566
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:35,848
Nimura.

567
01:08:50,493 --> 01:08:51,471
Nimura.

568
01:08:59,869 --> 01:09:01,780
Nimura.

569
01:09:54,957 --> 01:09:57,198
It was just a dream...

570
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:23,196
Hey, brother.
What's this mess?

571
01:10:24,453 --> 01:10:27,525
You never answer your phone.

572
01:10:40,803 --> 01:10:45,013
Thank you, everyone.
I really appreciate it.

573
01:10:57,419 --> 01:10:58,727
Say, brother.

574
01:10:59,855 --> 01:11:03,803
Can you make two copies of each
of these documents?

575
01:11:04,293 --> 01:11:05,533
Over here.

576
01:11:13,302 --> 01:11:16,283
You open this,

577
01:11:16,405 --> 01:11:20,945
and I told you two copies,
so you press two and then start.

578
01:11:22,378 --> 01:11:24,415
You can handle it, right?

579
01:11:36,859 --> 01:11:41,399
Hey, who is this?
This is our spot.

580
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:42,838
You can't just sit there.

581
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:44,000
Move.

582
01:11:48,771 --> 01:11:50,546
What's with him?

583
01:11:57,479 --> 01:11:58,685
Let me.

584
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:00,293
You're an idiot.

585
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:08,697
What's that?

586
01:12:10,526 --> 01:12:12,870
Walkie-talkies.
Let us talk to each other.

587
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:15,674
For real? Show me.

588
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:29,414
Just who are you?

589
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:30,823
I don't know.

590
01:12:30,946 --> 01:12:34,587
You don't know?
You sure you're not crazy?

591
01:12:34,717 --> 01:12:35,525
I am.

592
01:12:35,651 --> 01:12:36,561
So, you're crazy.

593
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:38,426
So you're just like us.

594
01:12:51,166 --> 01:12:54,545
Brother, time to call it a day.

595
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:55,876
Yes.

596
01:15:35,998 --> 01:15:37,375
Wow!

597
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,846
Don't go that way.

598
01:16:15,003 --> 01:16:17,074
Don't go that way!

599
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:26,710
Forgive me.

600
01:17:39,955 --> 01:17:43,630
I forgive you.

601
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:52,172
I forgive you.

602
01:17:57,939 --> 01:18:04,584
I forgive
all of you for everything.

603
01:18:43,251 --> 01:18:44,662
Pull the plug.

604
01:18:50,325 --> 01:18:51,963
Now, for our next story.

605
01:18:52,094 --> 01:18:56,008
There have been a rash
of jellyfish attacks all over Tokyo.

606
01:18:56,131 --> 01:18:57,974
Around 2pm on the 16th,
Aki Tanuma,

607
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:03,743
the seven year-old daughter of a
workman living in the Taito Ward

608
01:19:03,872 --> 01:19:07,410
was playing in a canal
near the Sumida River,

609
01:19:07,542 --> 01:19:11,513
when she fainted from shock.

610
01:19:11,646 --> 01:19:15,560
At the hospital, Aki was listed
in critical condition,

611
01:19:15,784 --> 01:19:20,460
but now, she has regained
consciousness and is out of danger.

612
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:24,560
A report from the Tokyo
Marine Biology Lab

613
01:19:24,693 --> 01:19:29,506
revealed that Aki had been stung
by a venomous Red Jellyfish.

614
01:19:30,031 --> 01:19:35,140
Red Jellyfish are marine animals
and, normally, it is inconceivable

615
01:19:35,270 --> 01:19:39,810
to find them in Tokyo's canals,
but reports of similar injuries

616
01:19:39,941 --> 01:19:43,286
have been pouring in this month.
Tokyo's Health Dept.

617
01:19:43,411 --> 01:19:47,450
Has begun a city-wide
extermination campaign.

618
01:20:07,736 --> 01:20:08,476
Excuse me.

619
01:20:08,603 --> 01:20:09,547
Yes.

620
01:20:10,238 --> 01:20:13,117
I wanted to find out
about adult adoption procedures.

621
01:20:13,241 --> 01:20:15,983
Adoption procedures?
Alright,

622
01:20:16,111 --> 01:20:20,821
this packet explains all
of the steps and conditions.

623
01:20:20,949 --> 01:20:22,986
Please start with that.

624
01:20:47,242 --> 01:20:51,918
I'm sorry, I'll fix it later.

625
01:20:52,047 --> 01:20:54,186
Oh, no rush.

626
01:20:55,083 --> 01:20:57,324
What were you doing up there?

627
01:20:58,687 --> 01:21:01,190
I was looking at the far distance.

628
01:21:01,323 --> 01:21:04,395
The far distance? What about it?

629
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:11,803
Mr. Arita,
have you ever been up there?

630
01:21:11,933 --> 01:21:12,968
No.

631
01:21:13,401 --> 01:21:17,440
I see. You can't see anything
from up there.

632
01:21:18,406 --> 01:21:20,408
That's what I discovered.

633
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:25,854
Nimura.

634
01:21:33,088 --> 01:21:35,261
No, forget it.

635
01:21:39,761 --> 01:21:42,071
What have I been doing?

636
01:21:43,999 --> 01:21:46,980
I got my "go ahead"
a long time ago.

637
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:24,239
We did it! We did it!

638
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:29,711
Nimura, Mamoru's dream
finally came true, amazing.

639
01:22:30,545 --> 01:22:32,252
Amazing.

640
01:22:33,648 --> 01:22:38,028
You guys are amazing!
Just amazing!

641
01:22:39,187 --> 01:22:40,757
Amazing.

642
01:22:41,656 --> 01:22:43,135
Mr. Arita.

643
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:46,704
- Let's leave them alone.
- Why?

644
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:49,366
They're headed out to sea.

645
01:22:49,497 --> 01:22:53,001
To sea? Why?

646
01:22:55,303 --> 01:22:58,250
They're escaping Tokyo.

647
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:02,151
Escaping Tokyo?
Hey guys. wait.

648
01:23:02,277 --> 01:23:07,158
Hey, wait, wait guys!

649
01:24:13,406 --> 01:24:15,352
They're gone.

650
01:24:17,677 --> 01:24:22,990
Have they abandoned us?

651
01:24:24,117 --> 01:24:25,653
No.

652
01:24:27,621 --> 01:24:35,621
I'm sure they'll come back someday.
That's what I believe.

653
01:24:37,163 --> 01:24:40,007
Someday? Like when?

654
01:24:41,568 --> 01:24:43,570
I don't know.

655
01:24:44,905 --> 01:24:48,318
In 10 years? In 20?

656
01:24:58,451 --> 01:25:00,556
I can't wait that long.

657
01:25:02,088 --> 01:25:04,898
I won't live that long.

658
01:25:27,981 --> 01:25:30,655
Watch out! Don't touch it!

659
01:25:31,718 --> 01:25:33,129
Nimura!

660
01:26:49,095 --> 01:26:51,132
Any fun ideas?

661
01:26:52,165 --> 01:26:54,076
Fun ideas?

662
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:55,440
None.

663
01:26:55,669 --> 01:26:57,649
Go find some.

664
01:26:58,938 --> 01:27:03,409
Speaking of which,
that guy from the other day...

665
01:27:03,543 --> 01:27:06,080
The guy who saw
the future in his dreams.

666
01:27:06,212 --> 01:27:07,987
Wonder what he's up to.

667
01:27:08,114 --> 01:27:08,888
Dunno.

668
01:27:09,015 --> 01:27:10,551
He was a real whacko.

669
01:27:10,684 --> 01:27:13,255
Yeah, that was a real mess.

670
01:27:13,386 --> 01:27:17,095
But I had a lot of fun.

671
01:27:17,223 --> 01:27:18,827
Me, too.

672
01:27:18,958 --> 01:27:21,495
I kinda got into it.

673
01:27:23,463 --> 01:27:24,601
Hey!

674
01:27:26,032 --> 01:27:27,067
What?

675
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:28,372
Wrong.

676
01:27:28,735 --> 01:27:32,774
I thought it was him for a second,

677
01:27:32,906 --> 01:27:34,385
but I was wrong.

678
01:28:52,352 --> 01:28:59,770
BRIGHT FUTURE

679
01:29:05,899 --> 01:29:12,976
I found the lost song

680
01:29:13,540 --> 01:29:19,354
in my heart

681
01:29:21,214 --> 01:29:27,324
Though someday,

682
01:29:27,854 --> 01:29:34,362
we'll all disappear

683
01:29:36,462 --> 01:29:43,004
Our feelings accumulate

684
01:29:44,103 --> 01:29:50,019
like white powdered snow

685
01:29:50,143 --> 01:29:57,288
It was a tiny revolution

686
01:29:58,551 --> 01:30:04,126
You touched my shoulder

687
01:30:05,959 --> 01:30:13,537
I held you and loved you

688
01:30:13,666 --> 01:30:21,551
That was everything

689
01:30:21,674 --> 01:30:28,649
Even borders seem to dissolve

690
01:30:28,781 --> 01:30:35,460
as the snow-flowers blossom

691
01:30:37,390 --> 01:30:42,806
A soap bubble flew by

692
01:30:45,064 --> 01:30:49,911
It burst and disappeared

693
01:30:50,803 --> 01:30:58,803
But let's keep blowing soap bubbles

694
01:30:59,379 --> 01:31:06,627
to reach the sky

695
01:31:06,753 --> 01:31:14,501
Leaping over a thousand nights

696
01:31:14,627 --> 01:31:20,100
We breathe together

697
01:31:22,568 --> 01:31:29,713
Now the world is endless

698
01:31:29,842 --> 01:31:37,761
And the future is bright

699
01:31:37,884 --> 01:31:42,026
