1
00:02:06,873 --> 00:02:08,864
<i>- Randolph?
- Yes?</i>

2
00:02:09,042 --> 00:02:11,374
<i>- What are you doing?
- Nothing.</i>

3
00:02:11,545 --> 00:02:14,207
<i>- Where are you going?
- Nowhere.</i>

4
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,451
Indians?

5
00:02:30,297 --> 00:02:34,757
<i>- Don't you do anything till I get down!
- All right.</i>

6
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,632
<i>- Bonjour, jeune homme.
- Oh, sure.</i>

7
00:05:09,022 --> 00:05:11,217
Can I have a lump of sugar?

8
00:05:12,492 --> 00:05:14,892
"Can I have a lump of sugar?", I said.

9
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:21,897
A lump of sugar? Certainly.

10
00:05:22,068 --> 00:05:24,400
- You're not Swiss.
- Here's a trick.

11
00:05:24,571 --> 00:05:28,564
- Are you German?
- I put the sugar on my hand.

12
00:05:28,742 --> 00:05:33,475
Now, you put your hand
underneath here and, wait now...

13
00:05:33,647 --> 00:05:36,775
I'm going to send the sugar
right through my hand.

14
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:40,442
- Are you English or something?
- Here we go.

15
00:05:42,122 --> 00:05:45,523
You could be Polish. Are you?
I'm American.

16
00:05:45,692 --> 00:05:49,128
- That makes two of us.
- You don't sound American.

17
00:05:49,295 --> 00:05:53,789
- That's because I live in Europe.
- In Europe? Why? What happened?

18
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:57,164
- I chose to. I like it.
- You like it? Europe?

19
00:05:57,337 --> 00:06:01,103
- You won't do your teeth any good.
- I haven't got any.

20
00:06:01,274 --> 00:06:04,539
- Are you a dental surgeon?
- No, I'm not.

21
00:06:04,711 --> 00:06:06,906
- See?
- My word.

22
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,483
I've got seven left. Mother counted
last night and one came out.

23
00:06:11,651 --> 00:06:15,712
She said she'd slap me
if any more came out. I can't help it.

24
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:20,826
The climate here makes them come out.
These hotels. Do you like hotels?

25
00:06:20,994 --> 00:06:25,192
- Are you staying here?
- I've just come to see my aunt.

26
00:06:25,365 --> 00:06:30,359
- You're not going to help your teeth.
- I gotta get me some candy, then.

27
00:06:30,537 --> 00:06:34,200
American candy is the only kind to eat.
You like her?

28
00:06:34,374 --> 00:06:37,832
- Like whom?
- I thought you were German. Your aunt.

29
00:06:38,011 --> 00:06:42,607
- Well, she's my aunt. Yes, I like her.
- I bet you don't.

30
00:07:08,808 --> 00:07:12,005
Randolph, you try that and I'll fix you.

31
00:07:20,587 --> 00:07:24,785
- How do you like that?
- She's right. How do you know her?

32
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,949
I don't know her.

33
00:07:27,127 --> 00:07:29,322
She's my sister.

34
00:07:51,384 --> 00:07:55,753
- What are you doing?
- I'm going up the Alps. This way.

35
00:07:55,922 --> 00:07:58,220
That's the way you come down.

36
00:07:58,391 --> 00:08:00,916
- He's American.
- You better be quiet.

37
00:08:01,094 --> 00:08:04,086
Your brother and I
have made acquaintance.

38
00:08:04,798 --> 00:08:09,497
- You're not taking that pole to Italy?
- Yes, I'm taking it.

39
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:15,232
- You'd better leave it somewhere.
- Italy? Are you thinking of the Simplon?

40
00:08:15,408 --> 00:08:18,536
- What mountain are we thinking of?
- Thinking of?

41
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:21,202
Why, going over. Right down to Italy.

42
00:08:21,381 --> 00:08:25,044
- I wanna go to America!
- Italy's a beautiful place.

43
00:08:25,218 --> 00:08:29,177
- Do they have candy?
- You've had enough. Mother agrees.

44
00:08:29,355 --> 00:08:32,017
I haven't had any for 100 weeks!

45
00:08:34,093 --> 00:08:36,391
It's a beautiful view.

46
00:08:36,563 --> 00:08:39,123
You can just see the Dents du Midi.

47
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:42,496
- Show her your trick.
- It's not a very good one.

48
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:46,765
- Would you care to sit down?
- I like just hanging round.

49
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:50,205
- He's American.
- A real American?

50
00:08:50,376 --> 00:08:54,745
- You seem more like a German.
- That's what I said.

51
00:08:54,914 --> 00:08:59,010
I've met Germans who sound American,
but not the other way round.

52
00:08:59,185 --> 00:09:02,313
- We're from New York State.
- Where I want to be.

53
00:09:02,488 --> 00:09:07,892
- You haven't told me your name.
- Randolph C Miller. I'll tell you hers, too.

54
00:09:08,061 --> 00:09:12,725
- I'd like to know it.
- Daisy Miller, but that ain't on her cards.

55
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:17,393
- Pity you don't have one.
- It's really Annie P Miller.

56
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:22,769
My father is Ezra B Miller. He's not
in Europe. He's in a better place.

57
00:09:22,942 --> 00:09:27,311
- I'm sorry.
- He's in Schenectady. He's very rich.

58
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,074
I'm gonna climb that tree.

59
00:09:32,252 --> 00:09:36,018
He doesn't like Europe.
He doesn't like me, either.

60
00:09:36,189 --> 00:09:41,354
He hasn't got any boys here. Well, one,
but he goes round with a teacher.

61
00:09:41,527 --> 00:09:45,827
- Your brother has no teacher?
- Mother thought of getting one.

62
00:09:45,999 --> 00:09:49,264
An American lady.
Mrs Sanders, from Boston.

63
00:09:49,435 --> 00:09:54,065
But Randolph didn't want a teacher
travelling round with us.

64
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,641
He said he wouldn't have lessons
in the cars.

65
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:01,337
We met an English lady in the cars,
a Miss Featherstone?

66
00:10:01,514 --> 00:10:05,075
She asked why
I didn't give Randolph "instruction".

67
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:09,415
- He could instruct me. He's very smart.
- He seems to be.

68
00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:13,355
Can you find people in Italy
to do that kind of thing?

69
00:10:13,526 --> 00:10:18,190
You can find people in Italy
to do almost any kind of thing.

70
00:10:18,364 --> 00:10:22,596
- He's going to college. Have you been?
- Yes, in Geneva.

71
00:10:23,202 --> 00:10:27,662
Miss Featherstone asked
if we didn't all live in hotels in America.

72
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,367
I'd never been in so many
hotels until I came to Europe.

73
00:10:31,544 --> 00:10:34,843
- Europe's nothing but hotels.
- There are a number.

74
00:10:35,014 --> 00:10:39,075
- I think Europe is perfectly sweet.
- I'm glad...

75
00:10:39,252 --> 00:10:42,551
I'm not disappointed.
I'd heard so much about it.

76
00:10:42,722 --> 00:10:44,952
So many friends have been.

77
00:10:45,124 --> 00:10:49,117
Whenever I put on a Paris dress
I feel I'm in Europe.

78
00:10:49,295 --> 00:10:54,198
- Are you waiting for someone?
- I'm taking my aunt for a cure.

79
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:58,633
They always made me wish
I was in Europe. The dresses.

80
00:10:58,805 --> 00:11:01,330
- What does she suffer from?
- Pardon?

81
00:11:01,507 --> 00:11:04,442
- Your aunt.
- Anything her doctors suggest.

82
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:09,274
But I don't know where the society
keeps itself here. Do you?

83
00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:12,714
- Well, I...
- I haven't seen anything of it.

84
00:11:12,885 --> 00:11:16,184
- Are you taking the cure?
- I hope I don't need it.

85
00:11:16,356 --> 00:11:19,917
I'm fond of society.
I've always had plenty of it.

86
00:11:20,093 --> 00:11:24,359
Not only in Schenectady,
but in New York, there's lots there.

87
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:28,125
Last winter, I had 17 dinners given me,
three by gentlemen.

88
00:11:28,334 --> 00:11:33,704
I've more friends there. More gentleman
friends. More young lady friends, too.

89
00:11:33,873 --> 00:11:38,537
- I've had a lot of gentlemen's society.
- I see.

90
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:42,541
- Have you been to the castle?
- Chillon?

91
00:11:42,715 --> 00:11:45,081
- Pardon?
- The Château de Chillon.

92
00:11:45,251 --> 00:11:47,378
- Have you been?
- Yes. And you?

93
00:11:47,553 --> 00:11:49,680
No. I want to go, dreadfully.

94
00:11:49,856 --> 00:11:52,654
I wouldn't leave without seeing it.

95
00:11:52,825 --> 00:11:55,225
You can drive, or take the steamer.

96
00:11:55,395 --> 00:11:59,889
That's what Eugenio says, our courier.
He makes all our arrangements.

97
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:04,935
He's the most fastidious man I ever saw,
but he's a splendid courier.

98
00:12:05,104 --> 00:12:09,404
We were going there last week,
but Mother got dyspepsia.

99
00:12:09,575 --> 00:12:12,976
- You could take her to the baths.
- I could ask...

100
00:12:13,146 --> 00:12:16,138
Randolph says
it's too old to be interesting.

101
00:12:16,315 --> 00:12:20,581
Mother's afraid to leave him alone
and Eugenio won't stay with him.

102
00:12:20,753 --> 00:12:23,779
But it will be too bad
if we don't go there.

103
00:12:23,956 --> 00:12:27,722
Can't you find someone
to stay with Randolph?

104
00:12:27,894 --> 00:12:30,419
- You could.
- I'd rather go to Chillon.

105
00:12:30,596 --> 00:12:32,587
- With me?
- And your mother.

106
00:12:32,765 --> 00:12:38,431
I don't think Mother would go...for you.
She's not much bent on going, anyway.

107
00:12:38,604 --> 00:12:42,768
Maybe she'll stay here with Randolph
and we can go.

108
00:12:42,942 --> 00:12:45,433
- We? You and I?
- Oh, Eugenio.

109
00:12:45,611 --> 00:12:48,876
I knew he'd be looking for me
any minute.

110
00:12:49,982 --> 00:12:53,816
Mademoiselle, it is time
to go into the village.

111
00:12:53,986 --> 00:12:57,319
- He's found a clock at an amazing price.
- I'm sure.

112
00:12:58,591 --> 00:13:02,687
- Mademoiselle has seen her brother?
- He doesn't want to come.

113
00:13:02,862 --> 00:13:06,821
- I'm going to that old castle.
- To Chillon?

114
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:10,628
- Mademoiselle has arranged it?
- You won't back out?

115
00:13:10,803 --> 00:13:14,398
- I won't be happy till we go.
- You're really American?

116
00:13:14,574 --> 00:13:18,101
You shall meet my aunt.
She will tell you all about me.

117
00:13:18,277 --> 00:13:20,802
Oh, well. Maybe we'll go someday.

118
00:13:30,857 --> 00:13:34,156
- You scared Eugenio!
- The carriage is waiting.

119
00:13:34,327 --> 00:13:38,525
- Randolph, we're going into town.
- I don't want to!

120
00:13:38,698 --> 00:13:42,225
What are you gonna do,
jump around on that pole?

121
00:13:42,768 --> 00:13:46,135
They're horribly common,
my dear Frederick.

122
00:13:46,305 --> 00:13:50,469
One does one's duty
by just ignoring them. Milk?

123
00:13:50,643 --> 00:13:53,806
Please. So you just ignore them?

124
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:58,212
I can't not. I wouldn't if I hadn't to.
Sugar?

125
00:13:58,384 --> 00:14:01,512
No, thank you. The little girl's very pretty.

126
00:14:01,687 --> 00:14:06,351
Of course she's very pretty.
But she's of the last crudity.

127
00:14:06,526 --> 00:14:11,054
- I see what you mean.
- She has that charming look they have.

128
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:15,394
- And she dresses to perfection.
- Yes...

129
00:14:15,568 --> 00:14:19,868
No, you don't know.
Can't think where they get their taste.

130
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:22,872
After all, she's not a Comanche Indian.

131
00:14:23,042 --> 00:14:28,844
Frederick, she's a young lady who has
an intimacy with her mama's courier.

132
00:14:29,015 --> 00:14:33,543
- Does she? An intimacy?
- There's no other name for it.

133
00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:36,552
The skinny little mother is just as bad.

134
00:14:36,722 --> 00:14:41,489
They treat the courier as a friend,
as a gentleman and a scholar.

135
00:14:41,661 --> 00:14:46,894
Very likely they've never seen a man
with such good manners.

136
00:14:47,066 --> 00:14:49,125
So like a gentleman.

137
00:14:49,302 --> 00:14:53,295
Probably corresponds to
the young lady's idea of a count.

138
00:14:53,472 --> 00:14:56,464
Sits with them in the garden
of an evening.

139
00:14:56,642 --> 00:14:59,270
I think he smokes in their faces.

140
00:14:59,445 --> 00:15:03,882
I'm not a courier,
yet she was very charming to me.

141
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:08,146
You might have mentioned
you had made her acquaintance.

142
00:15:08,321 --> 00:15:12,417
- We talked in the garden.
- Pray, what did you say?

143
00:15:12,592 --> 00:15:15,789
That I should introduce her
to my admirable aunt.

144
00:15:15,962 --> 00:15:18,954
Who is a thousand times obliged to you.

145
00:15:19,131 --> 00:15:23,124
- To guarantee my respectability.
- Who is to guarantee hers?

146
00:15:23,302 --> 00:15:25,429
That's cruel. She's very innocent.

147
00:15:25,605 --> 00:15:29,132
- You don't say that as if you believed it.
- How does one say it?

148
00:15:29,308 --> 00:15:33,369
- If you believed it, you wouldn't say it.
- She's uneducated, yes.

149
00:15:33,546 --> 00:15:38,779
But she's wonderfully pretty and nice
and I'm taking her to Chillon.

150
00:15:38,951 --> 00:15:42,512
You two are going off there together?

151
00:15:42,688 --> 00:15:45,816
I should think that proved
just the contrary.

152
00:15:45,992 --> 00:15:50,224
How long had you known her
when this project was formed?

153
00:15:50,396 --> 00:15:54,662
- You've been in Vevey 24 hours.
- I'd known her half an hour.

154
00:15:55,868 --> 00:15:58,200
Then she's just as I supposed.

155
00:15:58,371 --> 00:16:01,966
- What do you suppose?
- That she's a horror.

156
00:16:11,717 --> 00:16:14,948
Won't you meet her
and see for yourself?

157
00:16:15,121 --> 00:16:18,716
Is she really going alone with you
to that castle?

158
00:16:18,891 --> 00:16:20,882
She fully intends to.

159
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,928
Then I must decline
the honour of her acquaintance.

160
00:16:25,097 --> 00:16:29,158
I am not too old, thank heaven,
to be honestly shocked.

161
00:16:29,335 --> 00:16:32,896
Don't they all do these things,
the girls in New York?

162
00:16:33,072 --> 00:16:37,873
I'd like to see my granddaughters
do them, or anyone else that's proper.

163
00:16:38,044 --> 00:16:42,447
- You mean you really think that...?
- Think what, sir?

164
00:16:42,615 --> 00:16:47,609
That she's the sort of girl
who expects a man to carry her off?

165
00:16:47,787 --> 00:16:52,986
Frederick, I think you had better not
meddle with little American girls

166
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:56,595
Who are, as you mildly put it,
uneducated.

167
00:16:56,762 --> 00:17:00,698
You've lived too long out of the country.
You'll make a mistake.

168
00:17:00,866 --> 00:17:05,565
- You're too innocent.
- My dear Aunt, I'm not too innocent.

169
00:17:07,406 --> 00:17:10,273
Too guilty, then.

170
00:17:52,785 --> 00:17:56,778
- There you are. I was wondering.
- I've just finished dinner.

171
00:17:56,956 --> 00:17:58,947
- With your aunt?
- Yes.

172
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:02,959
- This is the stupidest evening.
- Have you been alone?

173
00:18:03,129 --> 00:18:05,996
I've been walking round with Mother.

174
00:18:06,165 --> 00:18:09,965
- She's gone to bed?
- No, she doesn't sleep hardly at all.

175
00:18:10,136 --> 00:18:13,128
She doesn't know how she lives.

176
00:18:13,305 --> 00:18:17,969
She's gone to try and put Randolph
to bed. He doesn't like to go to bed.

177
00:18:18,144 --> 00:18:22,581
- Let's hope she persuades him.
- He doesn't like her to talk to him.

178
00:18:22,748 --> 00:18:26,184
She's going to try to get Eugenio
to talk to him.

179
00:18:26,352 --> 00:18:29,685
But he can't seem to make
an impression on Randolph.

180
00:18:29,855 --> 00:18:33,018
- How's your aunt?
- Not very well.

181
00:18:33,192 --> 00:18:37,219
The chambermaid said
she's very proper, wears white puffs,

182
00:18:37,396 --> 00:18:40,695
dines alone
and every two days has a headache.

183
00:18:40,866 --> 00:18:43,858
- How observant!
- It's a lovely description.

184
00:18:44,036 --> 00:18:49,565
- I'd like her. She'd be very exclusive.
- Yes, she is that.

185
00:18:49,742 --> 00:18:52,074
I'm dying to be exclusive myself.

186
00:18:52,244 --> 00:18:56,874
I guess we are. We don't speak
to anyone or they don't speak to us.

187
00:18:57,049 --> 00:19:01,577
- I'd be glad to meet your aunt.
- She'd like to, but those headaches...

188
00:19:01,754 --> 00:19:05,656
- She doesn't have one every day.
- She tells me she does.

189
00:19:05,825 --> 00:19:09,852
She doesn't want to know me.
Why didn't you say so?

190
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:14,125
But she doesn't know anyone.
It's her wretched health.

191
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:18,066
You needn't be afraid.
Why should she want to know me?

192
00:19:18,237 --> 00:19:21,001
Gracious. She is exclusive.

193
00:19:21,173 --> 00:19:24,768
- To tell you the truth...
- Here comes Mother.

194
00:19:25,244 --> 00:19:29,374
- Bet she didn't get Randolph to bed.
- Are you sure it's her?

195
00:19:29,548 --> 00:19:33,075
I guess I know my own mother.
She's got my shawl on.

196
00:19:33,252 --> 00:19:36,688
She doesn't see you.
Or feels guilty about your shawl.

197
00:19:36,856 --> 00:19:41,293
I said she could wear it. She
won't come here because she sees you.

198
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,928
- I'd better leave.
- No, come on.

199
00:19:44,096 --> 00:19:47,463
She doesn't approve
of my walking with you.

200
00:19:47,633 --> 00:19:50,864
Mother doesn't like
any of my gentlemen friends.

201
00:19:51,036 --> 00:19:56,099
She's downright timid. But I do introduce
gentlemen, almost always.

202
00:19:56,275 --> 00:20:00,439
- Or I wouldn't think I'm natural.
- You'd better know my name.

203
00:20:00,613 --> 00:20:03,411
It's Frederick Forsyth Winterbourne.

204
00:20:03,582 --> 00:20:05,948
Oh, my, I can't say all that.

205
00:20:08,554 --> 00:20:12,786
Mother.
Mr Frederick Forsyth Winterbourne.

206
00:20:16,028 --> 00:20:18,588
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

207
00:20:18,764 --> 00:20:21,460
- I don't know why you wear this.
- I do.

208
00:20:21,634 --> 00:20:27,300
- Is Randolph in bed?
- No, he wants to talk to the waiter.

209
00:20:27,473 --> 00:20:30,567
- I was telling Mr Winterbourne.
- I've met your son.

210
00:20:30,743 --> 00:20:35,009
- I don't see how he lives.
- It isn't as bad as it was at Dover.

211
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:38,479
He sat up all night in the lobby.
Wouldn't budge.

212
00:20:38,651 --> 00:20:41,745
- I gave up.
- Does he sleep in the day?

213
00:20:41,921 --> 00:20:44,481
- Not much.
- He should make it up.

214
00:20:44,657 --> 00:20:47,751
- He just can't.
- He's real tiresome.

215
00:20:47,927 --> 00:20:51,363
I wouldn't think you'd talk
against your own brother.

216
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,725
- He is tiresome.
- He's only ten.

217
00:20:53,899 --> 00:20:56,663
He wouldn't even go to that castle.

218
00:20:56,835 --> 00:21:01,169
Your daughter has allowed me
the honour of being her guide.

219
00:21:02,841 --> 00:21:06,800
- I suppose you'll go in the cars.
- Or on the boat.

220
00:21:06,979 --> 00:21:10,380
I don't know.
I've never been up to that castle.

221
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:14,883
- You ought to go.
- Yes, but it seems we never could.

222
00:21:15,054 --> 00:21:18,581
- It would be a pity...
- Daisy wants to go everywhere.

223
00:21:18,757 --> 00:21:23,694
A lady here, I don't know her name,
says we don't want to see castles here.

224
00:21:23,862 --> 00:21:27,025
- I don't see...
- There are so many in Italy.

225
00:21:27,199 --> 00:21:29,759
We only want to see the principal ones.

226
00:21:29,935 --> 00:21:35,134
- We saw several in England.
- Yes, but Chillon is worth seeing.

227
00:21:35,307 --> 00:21:40,404
If Daisy is up to it. It seems there isn't
anything she wouldn't undertake.

228
00:21:40,579 --> 00:21:43,571
You're sure you won't join us?

229
00:21:44,149 --> 00:21:47,141
- You'd better go alone.
- Mr Winterbourne!

230
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:51,187
- Don't you want to take me on a boat?
- Annie Miller!

231
00:21:51,357 --> 00:21:55,919
- Do let her go.
- I wouldn't think she'd want to.

232
00:21:56,095 --> 00:21:59,087
I'm sure Mr Winterbourne
wants to take me.

233
00:21:59,264 --> 00:22:01,061
I'll row you to Chillon.

234
00:22:01,233 --> 00:22:04,066
You haven't spoken to me
for half an hour.

235
00:22:04,236 --> 00:22:06,431
I've been talking with your mother.

236
00:22:06,605 --> 00:22:11,565
- I want you to take me out in a boat.
- If you'll do me the honour.

237
00:22:11,744 --> 00:22:14,577
- I do like formality.
- It's a formal offer.

238
00:22:14,747 --> 00:22:18,410
- I got you to say something.
- You're teasing me.

239
00:22:18,584 --> 00:22:21,747
- I don't think so.
- Then let me give you a row.

240
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,583
- I love how he says it.
- It would be lovelier to do it.

241
00:22:25,758 --> 00:22:29,819
It would be. I can't wait.
Why wait for anything?

242
00:22:29,995 --> 00:22:33,761
- You should find out the time.
- It's eleven o'clock.

243
00:22:33,932 --> 00:22:37,595
- I'm going on a boat.
- At this hour, mademoiselle?

244
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:40,796
- With Mr Winterbourne.
- Tell her she can't.

245
00:22:40,973 --> 00:22:43,464
I think you'd better not, mademoiselle.

246
00:22:43,642 --> 00:22:46,770
Eugenio doesn't think anything's proper.

247
00:22:46,945 --> 00:22:49,106
Nevertheless, I'm at your service.

248
00:22:49,281 --> 00:22:52,910
- Is mademoiselle going alone?
- No, with this gentleman.

249
00:22:53,085 --> 00:22:56,816
I meant alone with the gentleman.
As mademoiselle pleases.

250
00:22:56,989 --> 00:23:00,516
- I hoped you'd make a fuss.
- Then I'll make one.

251
00:23:00,693 --> 00:23:04,720
- I just want a little fuss.
- Monsieur Randolph has retired.

252
00:23:04,897 --> 00:23:06,888
Then we can go in now.

253
00:23:07,066 --> 00:23:10,433
- I hope you're disappointed.
- I'm puzzled.

254
00:23:10,602 --> 00:23:13,435
I hope it won't keep you awake.

255
00:23:27,653 --> 00:23:29,518
Bang!

256
00:23:29,688 --> 00:23:32,054
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

257
00:23:32,224 --> 00:23:34,818
- Been there long?
- Long enough.

258
00:23:34,993 --> 00:23:37,257
- Want to come down?
- No.

259
00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:40,796
- Goodnight, then.
- Goodnight.

260
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:02,284
We're gonna make it!
We're gonna make it! Come on!

261
00:24:05,257 --> 00:24:07,521
Come on! Wait! Wait!

262
00:24:09,528 --> 00:24:12,190
We made it! I told you we would.

263
00:24:45,264 --> 00:24:48,256
"A mass of towers
on a block of boulders."

264
00:24:48,433 --> 00:24:53,427
- Victor Hugo.
- It's much nicer than the carriage.

265
00:24:53,605 --> 00:24:56,005
I have a passion for steamboats.

266
00:24:56,175 --> 00:24:59,872
There's always a lovely breeze
and lots of people.

267
00:25:00,045 --> 00:25:03,674
Why are you so solemn?
As if we're going to a funeral.

268
00:25:03,849 --> 00:25:08,081
- I was grinning from ear to ear.
- Your ears are very close.

269
00:25:08,253 --> 00:25:13,850
- Should I dance a hornpipe on the deck?
- I'll carry your hat around!

270
00:25:17,496 --> 00:25:22,763
- I was never better pleased.
- I like to make you say those things.

271
00:25:22,935 --> 00:25:25,802
- You're funny.
- Am I?

272
00:25:28,373 --> 00:25:31,069
Come on, let's be the first ones off.

273
00:26:13,085 --> 00:26:15,883
It was built maybe in the ninth cycle.

274
00:26:16,054 --> 00:26:22,118
But it was maked bigger and also
rebuilt from the 11th to the 13th cycles.

275
00:26:22,294 --> 00:26:24,285
- Centuries.
- Cycles.

276
00:26:24,463 --> 00:26:26,294
- Centuries.
- Yes, cycles.

277
00:26:26,465 --> 00:26:29,229
- What's up here?
- Excuse me.

278
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:53,554
I'm sure you know all that.

279
00:26:53,725 --> 00:26:58,822
The point was, the castle wasn't
all constructed at the same time.

280
00:26:58,997 --> 00:27:01,522
No. Between the 9th and 13th cycles.

281
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,168
- Centuries.
- Yes, cycles.

282
00:27:07,906 --> 00:27:12,070
A lot of people were imprisoned here,
including Bonnivard.

283
00:27:12,244 --> 00:27:14,769
- Was he here long?
- Four years.

284
00:27:14,947 --> 00:27:18,508
- Is that how long you've been here?
- Longer than that.

285
00:27:18,684 --> 00:27:22,814
I went to school in Geneva,
then to college there.

286
00:27:24,823 --> 00:27:26,814
What is this awful hole?

287
00:27:26,992 --> 00:27:30,325
<i>It's an oubliette. From oublier, to forget.</i>

288
00:27:30,495 --> 00:27:34,295
They would put a man in there
and throw away the key.

289
00:27:34,466 --> 00:27:37,026
- Do you have brothers or sisters?
- No.

290
00:27:37,202 --> 00:27:39,193
Oubliette.

291
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:45,333
- Look at that beautiful tower!
- Watch your head.

292
00:27:47,646 --> 00:27:52,276
- What are these holes for?
- I've never been told.

293
00:27:57,456 --> 00:28:02,052
The castle completely dominated
the pass through the Alps.

294
00:28:07,065 --> 00:28:10,865
Why don't you like America?
It's an impression you give.

295
00:28:11,036 --> 00:28:15,370
- I like America very much.
- "Oubliette" sounds funny.

296
00:28:17,642 --> 00:28:21,009
- Look out here!
- Be careful!

297
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:26,617
- It's all right, come on.
- It's very rotten. As it gets older, it...

298
00:28:26,785 --> 00:28:29,583
Yes, it is. It's very rotten.

299
00:28:29,755 --> 00:28:34,283
- Why are you rushing?
- I don't know why I'm rushing.

300
00:28:36,261 --> 00:28:41,858
- What's through here? Look!
- What? Watch your head there.

301
00:28:45,971 --> 00:28:48,269
- It's beautiful. Hello.
- Hello.

302
00:28:52,544 --> 00:28:56,310
<i>- I wonder what's through there.
- Wait for me.</i>

303
00:28:56,481 --> 00:29:00,042
<i>- There's steps here.
- Come on!</i>

304
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,981
Miss Miller!

305
00:29:08,593 --> 00:29:09,924
Amen!

306
00:29:11,063 --> 00:29:15,762
- Don't stray, you're liable to fall.
- Into the oubliette. Don't forget me.

307
00:29:19,137 --> 00:29:21,128
Oh, dear.

308
00:29:21,306 --> 00:29:24,571
Bonnivard was chained to that fifth pillar.

309
00:29:24,743 --> 00:29:26,335
My goodness.

310
00:29:26,511 --> 00:29:30,572
Lord Byron carved his name on it.
Wrote that poem about him.

311
00:29:30,749 --> 00:29:32,740
- What did he do?
- Byron?

312
00:29:32,918 --> 00:29:35,910
- Bonnivard.
- It was during the Reformation.

313
00:29:36,088 --> 00:29:39,819
He wanted Geneva to be free
from the Duke of Savoy,

314
00:29:39,991 --> 00:29:42,983
Who ambushed him
and brought him here.

315
00:29:43,161 --> 00:29:48,030
The Bernese stormed the castle
four years later and set him free.

316
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,136
"There are seven pillars of Gothic mould
In Chillon's dungeons deep and old

317
00:29:52,304 --> 00:29:55,034
"There are seven columns,
massy and grey

318
00:29:55,207 --> 00:29:59,667
"Dim with a dull imprison'd ray
A sunbeam which has lost its...

319
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:02,476
"...way."

320
00:30:03,548 --> 00:30:06,711
I never saw a man that knew so much!

321
00:30:06,885 --> 00:30:09,877
- You're teasing me again.
- No, it's lovely.

322
00:30:10,055 --> 00:30:14,253
I wish you'd go round with us.
We might learn something.

323
00:30:14,426 --> 00:30:18,988
- I wish that I could.
- Don't you wanna teach Randolph?

324
00:30:19,164 --> 00:30:23,157
I do, unfortunately,
have other occupations. There's...

325
00:30:23,335 --> 00:30:26,998
I don't believe a speck of it.
You're not in business.

326
00:30:27,172 --> 00:30:32,041
But I do have engagements. I have to
be back in Geneva in a day or so.

327
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:35,577
- I don't believe it. I'm cold now.
- Wait for me.

328
00:30:39,951 --> 00:30:43,284
You see the design
of this fireplace here?

329
00:30:43,455 --> 00:30:46,618
You're not really
going back to Geneva?

330
00:30:46,791 --> 00:30:49,589
Yes. I have to be there tomorrow.

331
00:30:49,761 --> 00:30:52,389
Mr Winterbourne, I think you're horrible.

332
00:30:52,564 --> 00:30:54,896
Don't say a thing like that!

333
00:30:55,066 --> 00:30:58,297
I've a good mind to go back alone.

334
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:03,407
- Wait, there's so much more to see.
- I think you're horrid!

335
00:31:07,946 --> 00:31:11,473
Who is she, this charmer
Waiting for you in Geneva?

336
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:13,777
You're completely mistaken.

337
00:31:13,952 --> 00:31:18,321
Doesn't she give you
more than two days off at a time?

338
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:23,427
- I have studies to complete.
- Doesn't she give you a vacation?

339
00:31:23,595 --> 00:31:25,222
Please stop teasing.

340
00:31:25,397 --> 00:31:28,662
If you stay an extra day
she'll come after you.

341
00:31:28,833 --> 00:31:31,358
Stay till Friday, so I can see her.

342
00:31:31,536 --> 00:31:34,562
Please stop.
We were having such a good time.

343
00:31:34,739 --> 00:31:37,105
Miss Miller?

344
00:31:38,343 --> 00:31:42,541
- You think I'm teasing?
- Aren't you?

345
00:31:42,714 --> 00:31:47,447
All right, I'll stop. If you promise
to come to Rome while we're there.

346
00:31:47,619 --> 00:31:52,921
My aunt's taking an apartment there.
She's asked me to come and see her.

347
00:31:53,091 --> 00:31:56,083
I want you to come just for me.

348
00:31:56,261 --> 00:31:59,753
All right. At any rate,
I will certainly come.

349
00:32:02,167 --> 00:32:06,297
- Shall we go back?
- I don't want to take the boat now.

350
00:32:07,272 --> 00:32:09,536
Well, there'll be a carriage.

351
00:33:14,406 --> 00:33:19,969
...the little abomination's picked up
half a dozen fortune hunters.

352
00:33:20,145 --> 00:33:23,706
Close those windows,
I'm getting another headache.

353
00:33:23,882 --> 00:33:28,444
I wish these Italians wouldn't put
so much garlic in their music.

354
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:31,316
- You were saying?
- What about?

355
00:33:31,489 --> 00:33:35,516
- The fortune hunters. And Miss Miller.
- Yes.

356
00:33:35,694 --> 00:33:38,788
The fortune hunters
are of the inferior sort.

357
00:33:38,963 --> 00:33:44,094
She rackets about with them alone
in a way that makes much talk.

358
00:33:44,269 --> 00:33:49,138
She takes them to such houses
as her nose is allowed into.

359
00:33:49,307 --> 00:33:53,266
When she comes to such a party
as she can come to,

360
00:33:53,445 --> 00:33:56,505
she brings one particular
Italian gentleman

361
00:33:56,681 --> 00:34:01,516
Who has a good deal of manner,
with whom she seems very intimate.

362
00:34:01,686 --> 00:34:04,519
As to what happens further
between them,

363
00:34:04,689 --> 00:34:07,749
you must apply elsewhere
for information.

364
00:34:07,926 --> 00:34:11,657
- Where is the mother?
- I haven't the least idea.

365
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:15,493
I really know nothing about them
whatever.

366
00:34:20,238 --> 00:34:23,571
- How are my three cousins?
- Splendid.

367
00:34:23,742 --> 00:34:27,735
Alexander's moved up the block
from the 42nd Street house.

368
00:34:27,912 --> 00:34:30,540
Anthony is still out on Riverside Drive.

369
00:34:30,715 --> 00:34:34,947
- Has Andrew been to see you?
- No. I heard he was in Hamburg.

370
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:39,318
He seems prodigiously busy.
He is in every city that I am not.

371
00:34:39,491 --> 00:34:42,358
Are you coming to Mrs Walker's tea?

372
00:34:42,527 --> 00:34:47,328
I find it difficult to take tea. Even more
difficult to take Mrs Walker.

373
00:34:47,499 --> 00:34:50,491
- I think I might go.
- If you must.

374
00:34:50,668 --> 00:34:54,195
I only hope you won't run into
those dreadful people.

375
00:34:54,372 --> 00:34:58,502
Perhaps I won't go
to see them right away.

376
00:34:58,676 --> 00:35:02,009
But after Vevey,
I think I might call on them.

377
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:06,514
If after what I tell you
you still care to, you are welcome.

378
00:35:06,684 --> 00:35:11,018
Men may know everyone and
they are welcome to the privilege.

379
00:35:11,189 --> 00:35:14,920
They may be ignorant,
but they are not bad.

380
00:35:15,093 --> 00:35:20,429
Whether or not being vulgar is being bad
is a question for the metaphysicians.

381
00:35:20,598 --> 00:35:22,793
They're bad enough to blush for.

382
00:35:22,967 --> 00:35:27,563
- Who is the portrait for?
- And that's enough. My sons.

383
00:35:27,739 --> 00:35:32,176
I'm presenting each one with a copy.
It's ludicrously expensive.

384
00:35:32,343 --> 00:35:37,474
I can never bring myself to bargain.
I prefer to be robbed.

385
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:43,815
You know how a Roman distinguishes
between his pleasures and his sins?

386
00:35:43,988 --> 00:35:48,482
Pleasures are what he enjoys
and sins are what he confesses.

387
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:52,653
I don't think the Romans
have a monopoly on that.

388
00:35:52,831 --> 00:35:56,392
- How was Geneva?
- Pleasant. You stayed here?

389
00:35:56,568 --> 00:36:00,197
Yes, but the boys are there.
I wish you'd look them up.

390
00:36:00,371 --> 00:36:06,037
- I was fairly busy with my studies.
- Did you see Olga?

391
00:36:06,211 --> 00:36:08,202
On occasion.

392
00:36:08,379 --> 00:36:10,973
- Pity she never married.
- Is it?

393
00:36:11,149 --> 00:36:15,142
But there are some
singular stories about her.

394
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:20,485
- Mr and Mrs Johnson.
- Pardon me, I have to be a hostess.

395
00:36:20,658 --> 00:36:22,990
But I'm not through with you.

396
00:36:23,161 --> 00:36:27,928
Hello, Mr and Mrs Johnson.
I am so pleased that you could come.

397
00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:33,230
- Madame Miller.
- I want you to meet the Sinclairs.

398
00:36:33,404 --> 00:36:38,307
- Hello. Hello, Miss Miller!
- I'm ever so happy to see you!

399
00:36:38,476 --> 00:36:42,435
I'm so happy to see you.
Here's your mother at last.

400
00:36:42,614 --> 00:36:44,605
- I know you.
- And I know you.

401
00:36:44,782 --> 00:36:48,980
- How are you, Randolph?
- Well, I declare!

402
00:36:49,153 --> 00:36:51,917
- I told you I'd come.
- I didn't believe it.

403
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:55,082
- You could have come to see me.
- I only arrived today.

404
00:36:55,426 --> 00:36:58,623
- I don't believe a word of it.
- Mrs Miller...

405
00:36:58,796 --> 00:37:02,163
You have the most beautiful house
in Rome.

406
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:06,394
You should know.
I hear you've been in all of them.

407
00:37:06,571 --> 00:37:09,802
We got a bigger place.
More gold on the walls.

408
00:37:09,974 --> 00:37:14,536
- I knew you'd say something.
- It is bigger, too.

409
00:37:14,712 --> 00:37:17,704
- I hope you've been well.
- Not very.

410
00:37:17,882 --> 00:37:20,612
She's got dyspepsia. I've got it, too.

411
00:37:20,785 --> 00:37:23,754
Father's got it bad. I've got it worse.

412
00:37:23,922 --> 00:37:27,289
- Too much sugar.
- I suffer from the liver.

413
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:31,622
This climate is less bracing
than Schenectady.

414
00:37:31,796 --> 00:37:36,927
I haven't found anyone like Dr Davis
and I don't believe I will.

415
00:37:37,101 --> 00:37:42,505
He has so much to do, but there's
nothing he wouldn't do for me.

416
00:37:42,674 --> 00:37:47,134
There was nothing he wouldn't try
for my dyspepsia.

417
00:37:47,312 --> 00:37:52,545
He was just going to try something new
when we left.

418
00:37:52,717 --> 00:37:55,811
Mr Miller wanted Daisy to see Europe.

419
00:37:55,987 --> 00:38:00,981
But I don't know if I can get on
much longer without Dr Davis.

420
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:06,222
In Schenectady he's at the very top.
It affects my sleep.

421
00:38:06,397 --> 00:38:11,494
- But you are enjoying Rome?
- I must say I'm disappointed.

422
00:38:11,669 --> 00:38:17,198
We'd heard so much about it.
We expected something different.

423
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:20,037
I'm sure you'll grow very fond of it.

424
00:38:20,211 --> 00:38:23,977
- I hate it worse every day.
- Like the infant Hannibal.

425
00:38:24,148 --> 00:38:27,584
- I ain't like any infant.
- You never were.

426
00:38:27,752 --> 00:38:31,711
- We've seen places ahead of Rome.
- For example?

427
00:38:31,889 --> 00:38:37,054
I think Zurich's real lovely and
we didn't hear half so much about it.

428
00:38:37,228 --> 00:38:39,719
<i>The best place is the City of Richmond.</i>

429
00:38:39,897 --> 00:38:44,266
He means the ship. Randolph had
a good time on the crossing.

430
00:38:44,435 --> 00:38:47,029
But it was going the wrong way.

431
00:38:47,205 --> 00:38:51,369
It'll turn around and
go the right way some time.

432
00:38:51,542 --> 00:38:54,773
- Daisy seems happy.
- Yes.

433
00:38:54,946 --> 00:38:57,847
It's on account of the splendid society.

434
00:38:58,016 --> 00:39:01,315
- She's made many acquaintances.
- I've heard.

435
00:39:01,486 --> 00:39:06,480
She goes round more than I do.
They've taken her right in.

436
00:39:06,658 --> 00:39:12,494
She knows a great many gentlemen.
She thinks there's nothing like Rome.

437
00:39:12,664 --> 00:39:16,896
- I've been saying how mean you were.
- Mean?

438
00:39:17,068 --> 00:39:21,698
At Vevey, you wouldn't stay
when I asked. He went to Geneva.

439
00:39:21,873 --> 00:39:26,037
Have I come to Rome
to be riddled by your silver shafts?

440
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:29,611
Just listen! Did you ever hear
anything so quaint?

441
00:39:29,781 --> 00:39:31,908
- Quaint?
- Mrs Walker...

442
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:35,849
We've got to go.
Eugenio will raise something fierce.

443
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:39,478
- I'm coming to your party.
- Delighted to hear it.

444
00:39:39,657 --> 00:39:43,593
I want to ask a favour,
permission to bring a friend.

445
00:39:43,761 --> 00:39:47,527
- I'd be happy to see your friends.
- They're not mine.

446
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:52,363
- An intimate friend. Mr Giovanelli.
- I'd be happy to have him come.

447
00:39:52,537 --> 00:39:57,770
He's the handsomest man in the world
except for Mr Winterbourne.

448
00:39:57,942 --> 00:40:00,843
He wants to know some Americans.

449
00:40:01,012 --> 00:40:06,279
<i>- He's tremendously clever.
- I look forward to meeting him.</i>

450
00:40:06,451 --> 00:40:10,046
Mother, Eugenio's really gonna
raise something.

451
00:40:10,221 --> 00:40:14,590
- We'd better go back.
- You go. I'm gonna walk round a little.

452
00:40:14,759 --> 00:40:18,126
- With Mr Giovanelli.
- On the Pincio.

453
00:40:18,296 --> 00:40:22,460
- Alone? It's not safe.
- There are lots of people there.

454
00:40:22,633 --> 00:40:27,969
- That's why it's not safe.
- You're sure to catch a Roman fever.

455
00:40:28,139 --> 00:40:32,166
- Give her that medicine.
- Mrs Walker, you're too perfect.

456
00:40:32,343 --> 00:40:35,710
- I'm meeting a friend.
- Mr Giovanelli.

457
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:40,408
- Is it Mr Giovanelli?
- The beautiful Mr Giovanelli.

458
00:40:40,585 --> 00:40:45,921
My dear girl, don't prowl off at this hour
to meet a beautiful Italian.

459
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:49,526
- He speaks first-rate English.
- What a fuss.

460
00:40:49,694 --> 00:40:54,324
I don't want to do anything that affects
my health or my character.

461
00:40:54,499 --> 00:40:59,869
If Mr Winterbourne were as polite as
he pretends, he'd offer to walk me there.

462
00:41:00,037 --> 00:41:05,031
- I wonder if I might have the pleasure.
- How gracious of you!

463
00:41:11,182 --> 00:41:14,242
Goodbye, Eugenio, I'm taking a walk.

464
00:41:34,705 --> 00:41:39,472
This is the most beautiful spot in Rome.
More beautiful than Central Park.

465
00:41:39,644 --> 00:41:42,772
Why haven't you been to see me?

466
00:41:42,947 --> 00:41:47,850
- I just stepped off the train.
- You must've stayed on after it stopped.

467
00:41:48,019 --> 00:41:50,715
- You had time to see Mrs Walker.
- I knew Mrs Walker...

468
00:41:50,888 --> 00:41:53,448
You knew her in Geneva. She told me.

469
00:41:53,624 --> 00:41:56,923
You knew me at Vevey.
So you should have come.

470
00:41:57,094 --> 00:42:01,121
I heard you hadn't been
lacking in company.

471
00:42:01,299 --> 00:42:04,791
Eugenio says we have
the best hotel rooms in Rome.

472
00:42:04,969 --> 00:42:08,427
We're staying all winter
if we don't die of the fever.

473
00:42:08,606 --> 00:42:11,939
I thought it would be
awfully quiet and pokey.

474
00:42:12,109 --> 00:42:16,136
I was sure we'd be going round
with one of those old men

475
00:42:16,314 --> 00:42:20,546
Who explain about pictures.
But we only had a week of that.

476
00:42:20,718 --> 00:42:24,620
I know ever so many people.
The society is very select.

477
00:42:24,789 --> 00:42:29,783
There are English, Germans, Italians.
I think I like the English best.

478
00:42:29,961 --> 00:42:34,625
I never saw anything so hospitable.
There's something every day.

479
00:42:34,799 --> 00:42:40,101
There's not much dancing, but I never
thought dancing was everything.

480
00:42:40,271 --> 00:42:42,739
I was always fond of conversation.

481
00:42:42,907 --> 00:42:47,469
And Mrs Walker's rooms
are too small for anything else!

482
00:44:33,384 --> 00:44:35,375
One more.

483
00:44:35,553 --> 00:44:39,489
Shall we buy some candy
for poor old Randolph?

484
00:44:39,657 --> 00:44:41,852
<i>- All right.
- Quanto è?</i>

485
00:44:42,026 --> 00:44:44,586
<i>- I want that one.
- Due, prego.</i>

486
00:44:44,762 --> 00:44:46,821
<i>- Sì, sì.
- Grazie.</i>

487
00:44:46,998 --> 00:44:50,399
- I'll walk you back.
- I'm meeting Mr Giovanelli.

488
00:44:50,568 --> 00:44:53,036
- Must you?
- He's waiting here somewhere.

489
00:44:53,204 --> 00:44:56,731
- I'm not helping you find him.
- I'll find him.

490
00:44:56,907 --> 00:44:58,898
You're not leaving me.

491
00:44:59,076 --> 00:45:02,671
Are you afraid you'll get lost
with your lollipop?

492
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:07,716
- Now, see here...
- There he is. Leaning against that tree.

493
00:45:11,088 --> 00:45:15,616
- Did you ever see anything so cool?
- You mean to speak to that thing?

494
00:45:15,793 --> 00:45:20,560
- I'm not going to communicate by signs.
- I intend to come with you.

495
00:45:20,731 --> 00:45:24,827
- You sound too imperious.
- I wanted to express my meaning.

496
00:45:25,002 --> 00:45:28,028
I've never allowed a gentleman
to dictate to me.

497
00:45:28,205 --> 00:45:32,539
You should listen to a gentleman
sometimes, the right one.

498
00:45:33,778 --> 00:45:38,772
I do nothing but listen to gentlemen.
Tell me if Mr Giovanelli's the right one.

499
00:45:38,949 --> 00:45:41,110
Miss Miller! Here!

500
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:48,890
No, he's not the right one.

501
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:18,652
What have you done today,
aside from getting dressed?

502
00:46:18,823 --> 00:46:22,987
- The most amusing lady I never meet.
- Ever meet.

503
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:25,651
- You are American, no?
- Yes.

504
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:28,993
- He never lives there.
- You don't like?

505
00:46:29,166 --> 00:46:32,260
Not at all. I've simply been
studying at Geneva.

506
00:46:32,436 --> 00:46:34,427
- I like America.
- You've been?

507
00:46:34,605 --> 00:46:36,630
- Please?
- To America?

508
00:46:36,807 --> 00:46:39,367
- No, never. Ever?
- Never.

509
00:46:39,543 --> 00:46:43,070
I go there one day.
I don't like Italians so much.

510
00:46:43,247 --> 00:46:46,114
<i>- I do.
- Because you are...gentile?</i>

511
00:46:46,283 --> 00:46:48,148
- Nice.
- Thank you.

512
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:51,618
- Thank you.
- Mr Winterbourne!

513
00:46:51,789 --> 00:46:56,692
Mr Winterbourne? Mrs Walker just there.
She ask you come.

514
00:46:56,861 --> 00:47:00,160
- Excuse me.
- Women follow wherever he goes.

515
00:47:01,899 --> 00:47:04,333
Good afternoon. What brings you here?

516
00:47:04,502 --> 00:47:08,063
That girl mustn't be allowed
to do this sort of thing.

517
00:47:08,239 --> 00:47:12,005
Walking with two men.
Fifty people have noticed her.

518
00:47:13,277 --> 00:47:17,577
- It's a shame to make a fuss.
- Or to let her ruin herself.

519
00:47:17,748 --> 00:47:20,080
- She's innocent.
- She's reckless.

520
00:47:20,251 --> 00:47:22,685
Goodness knows how far it may go.

521
00:47:22,853 --> 00:47:26,687
Did you ever see
anything so imbecile as the mother?

522
00:47:26,857 --> 00:47:29,223
Allowing her daughter to...

523
00:47:29,393 --> 00:47:33,022
After you left I couldn't sit still,
thinking about it.

524
00:47:33,197 --> 00:47:35,791
What do you plan to do with us now?

525
00:47:35,966 --> 00:47:40,130
If she will ride with me,
it will seem as though it's arranged.

526
00:47:40,304 --> 00:47:45,298
The world will see she's not running wild.
Ask her to step over here.

527
00:47:45,476 --> 00:47:49,071
I don't think it's a happy idea,
but you're free to try.

528
00:48:01,292 --> 00:48:06,252
Hello again. I'm enchanted to be able to
introduce Mr Giovanelli. This is he.

529
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:11,026
This is Mrs Walker,
who so sweetly asked you to her party.

530
00:48:11,202 --> 00:48:16,162
- I am most honoured.
- That is the loveliest carriage rug ever.

531
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:19,002
Do get in and let me put it over you.

532
00:48:19,176 --> 00:48:22,441
No, thank you.
I like watching you drive with it.

533
00:48:22,613 --> 00:48:25,275
Do get in and drive about with me.

534
00:48:25,449 --> 00:48:31,911
- It's so fascinating just as I am.
- Maybe. But it's not the custom here.

535
00:48:32,089 --> 00:48:35,855
- If I didn't walk, I'd expire.
- Walk with your mother.

536
00:48:36,026 --> 00:48:39,427
My mother never walked
ten steps in her life.

537
00:48:39,597 --> 00:48:41,622
I'm not five years old.

538
00:48:41,799 --> 00:48:46,566
You're old enough to be reasonable,
Miss Miller, and to be talked about.

539
00:48:46,737 --> 00:48:50,935
- What do you mean?
- Come in here and I will tell you.

540
00:48:54,411 --> 00:48:57,141
I don't think I want to know.

541
00:48:58,682 --> 00:49:03,278
You should know. Or do you prefer
being thought a reckless girl?

542
00:49:04,688 --> 00:49:06,679
Gracious me!

543
00:49:09,426 --> 00:49:14,125
Does Mr Winterbourne think
I should get in the carriage?

544
00:49:21,305 --> 00:49:23,136
I think you should.

545
00:49:23,307 --> 00:49:25,707
I never heard anything so stiff!

546
00:49:25,876 --> 00:49:29,676
If this is improper, I'm improper.
You should give me up.

547
00:49:29,847 --> 00:49:32,611
Goodbye. Have a lovely ride.

548
00:49:35,653 --> 00:49:39,350
- Get in.
- I feel I should accompany her.

549
00:49:39,523 --> 00:49:43,459
If you don't get in,
I shall never speak to you again.

550
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:51,463
All right. Just a moment.

551
00:49:54,772 --> 00:49:59,709
- Here he comes at last.
- I'm sorry, she insists I ride with her.

552
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:01,639
Forgive me.

553
00:50:12,956 --> 00:50:17,689
- That wasn't very clever of you.
- I don't wish to be clever, only honest.

554
00:50:17,861 --> 00:50:20,386
Your honesty's only put her off.

555
00:50:20,597 --> 00:50:25,000
If she means to compromise herself,
the sooner one knows, the better.

556
00:50:25,169 --> 00:50:29,572
- She meant no harm.
- That's what I thought a month ago.

557
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:33,733
- What's she done?
- Everything that's not done here.

558
00:50:33,911 --> 00:50:36,937
Sitting in corners
With mysterious Italians.

559
00:50:37,114 --> 00:50:39,605
Dancing all evening with one partner.

560
00:50:39,783 --> 00:50:43,549
Receiving callers late at night.
Her mother melts away.

561
00:50:43,721 --> 00:50:48,215
- Her brother sits up till two.
- He must be edified by what he sees.

562
00:50:48,392 --> 00:50:53,921
A smile goes around the hotel servants
when a gentleman asks for Miss Miller.

563
00:50:54,098 --> 00:50:56,896
We shouldn't pay attention to servants.

564
00:50:57,067 --> 00:51:01,868
Her only fault is to think Giovanelli
a gentleman, when he's a poor imitation.

565
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:05,873
- There you are.
- He's some third-rate artist.

566
00:51:06,043 --> 00:51:09,206
- But how can she know?
- She's naturally indelicate.

567
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:12,042
- How long had you known her?
- Two days.

568
00:51:12,216 --> 00:51:14,810
That remark about your going to Geneva!

569
00:51:14,985 --> 00:51:19,649
Taste never has been
the Miller family's strongest point.

570
00:51:22,292 --> 00:51:24,590
On the other hand, Mrs Walker...

571
00:51:25,963 --> 00:51:29,797
...perhaps you and I
have lived too long at Geneva.

572
00:51:32,936 --> 00:51:35,928
- I think you should stop.
- Stop?

573
00:51:36,106 --> 00:51:39,439
Encouraging the girl.
Flirting with her yourself.

574
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:44,809
Giving her any further opportunity
to expose herself. Let her alone.

575
00:51:44,982 --> 00:51:48,782
I can't do anything
as enlightened as that.

576
00:51:48,952 --> 00:51:53,821
- I like her very much.
- So don't help her to make a scandal.

577
00:51:53,991 --> 00:51:57,825
There'd be nothing scandalous
in my attentions.

578
00:51:58,962 --> 00:52:02,659
I've said what I had to.
If you wish to rejoin her...

579
00:52:03,834 --> 00:52:07,531
- ...you have a chance.
- I believe I will.

580
00:52:07,704 --> 00:52:09,695
As you wish.

581
00:53:09,933 --> 00:53:14,097
- Madame Miller.
- Finally.

582
00:53:14,271 --> 00:53:17,570
- Excuse me.
- I wouldn't miss this.

583
00:53:17,741 --> 00:53:20,073
No, I've come all alone, you see.

584
00:53:20,244 --> 00:53:25,045
It's the first time I've ever been
to a party alone, especially in Italy.

585
00:53:25,215 --> 00:53:29,515
I wanted to bring Randolph,
but Daisy pushed me off by myself.

586
00:53:29,686 --> 00:53:33,178
- Doesn't she intend...
- I'm not used to being alone.

587
00:53:33,357 --> 00:53:37,919
- ...to favour us with her company?
- Daisy dressed before dinner.

588
00:53:38,095 --> 00:53:41,360
A friend is there,
the gentleman she was bringing.

589
00:53:41,532 --> 00:53:44,194
Mr Giovanelli. I've had the pleasure.

590
00:53:44,368 --> 00:53:48,498
They got going at the piano,
seems they couldn't stop.

591
00:53:48,672 --> 00:53:52,199
Mr Giovanelli does sing splendidly.

592
00:53:52,376 --> 00:53:54,867
I guess they'll come before very long.

593
00:53:55,045 --> 00:53:57,673
I'm sorry she's coming in that way.

594
00:53:57,848 --> 00:54:02,842
Charles, she's trying to take
revenge on me. I won't speak to her.

595
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:08,253
No use putting on that dress
just to sit around with Mr Giovanelli.

596
00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:29,508
Miss Miller.

597
00:54:35,852 --> 00:54:40,414
I'm afraid you thought
I was never coming. This is for you.

598
00:54:40,591 --> 00:54:45,358
Mr Giovanelli sings beautifully.
I want you to ask him to sing.

599
00:54:45,529 --> 00:54:47,724
- Mr Giovanelli.
- How do you do?

600
00:54:47,898 --> 00:54:51,800
- I'm sorry we are late.
- He knows such charming songs.

601
00:54:51,969 --> 00:54:55,700
I made him go over them.
Is there anyone here I know?

602
00:54:55,872 --> 00:54:58,432
I think everyone knows you.

603
00:54:59,276 --> 00:55:01,870
- You are hungry?
- Yes. Mother!

604
00:55:02,045 --> 00:55:06,948
- Did you get Randolph to bed?
- The singing kept him awake.

605
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:47,980
I do hope this is the finale.
I still don't know who asked him to sing.

606
00:55:48,158 --> 00:55:52,254
- Daisy Miller.
- She's too busy chattering.

607
00:55:52,429 --> 00:55:55,956
She's worked her way over
to your old college chum.

608
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:07,904
- These rooms are too small to dance...
- I can't dance a step.

609
00:56:08,078 --> 00:56:12,538
Your legs must be stiff
from being in that carriage so long.

610
00:56:12,716 --> 00:56:15,014
They were quite restless there.

611
00:56:15,185 --> 00:56:19,713
- They wanted to walk beside you.
- We paired off. That was better.

612
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:25,351
My other friend stuck by me. He seems
more in control of his limbs than you are.

613
00:56:25,529 --> 00:56:29,522
Fancy Mrs Walker wanting me
to get in her carriage,

614
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:32,100
supposedly just to be proper.

615
00:56:32,269 --> 00:56:37,104
People do have different ideas.
We'd talked about that walk for days.

616
00:56:37,274 --> 00:56:42,871
He'd never dare ask a young Italian lady
to walk about the streets with him.

617
00:56:43,046 --> 00:56:47,949
Then where would he ask her to walk?
Pincio's not the streets, anyway.

618
00:56:48,118 --> 00:56:52,111
Young Italian ladies
must have a pokey time of it.

619
00:56:52,289 --> 00:56:54,723
I'm not changing my habits for them.

620
00:56:54,891 --> 00:56:59,055
- You have the habits of a flirt.
- I'm a terrible flirt.

621
00:56:59,229 --> 00:57:02,562
What nice girl isn't?
Now you'll say I'm not nice.

622
00:57:02,733 --> 00:57:07,067
- You're a very nice girl, but I wish...
- What?

623
00:57:07,237 --> 00:57:11,503
- I wish you'd flirt only with me.
- Thank you very much.

624
00:57:11,675 --> 00:57:14,405
I wouldn't flirt with you. You're too stiff.

625
00:57:14,578 --> 00:57:18,070
- You say that too often.
- lf it makes you angry, I'll say it again.

626
00:57:18,248 --> 00:57:21,308
- Anger makes me even stiffer.
- I'd like to see that.

627
00:57:21,485 --> 00:57:25,785
Stop flirting with your friend at the piano.
They don't understand it here.

628
00:57:25,956 --> 00:57:29,517
- Really?
- Not in young, unmarried women.

629
00:57:29,693 --> 00:57:33,629
It seems to me more proper
than in old, married ones.

630
00:57:33,797 --> 00:57:37,631
Flirting is an American custom.
It doesn't exist here.

631
00:57:37,801 --> 00:57:40,793
When you go about with him,
without your mother...

632
00:57:40,971 --> 00:57:42,529
Poor Mother.

633
00:57:42,706 --> 00:57:46,403
You may be flirting, but he is not.
He means something else.

634
00:57:46,576 --> 00:57:52,071
At least he isn't preaching. And neither
of us is flirting. We're too good friends.

635
00:57:52,249 --> 00:57:55,548
- We're real intimate friends.
- I see.

636
00:57:55,719 --> 00:57:59,519
If you're in love,
it's quite another affair.

637
00:58:01,158 --> 00:58:06,790
Mr Giovanelli at least... He never says
such very unpleasant things to me.

638
00:58:20,977 --> 00:58:23,445
Do you want tea? ln the other room.

639
00:58:23,613 --> 00:58:25,911
You didn't offer me any tea.

640
00:58:26,082 --> 00:58:30,246
- I offered you some good advice.
- I prefer weak tea.

641
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:33,446
I'm glad you sang.
I just love that song.

642
00:58:55,679 --> 00:59:01,549
I don't care what he does to me
as long as it brings me relief.

643
00:59:01,718 --> 00:59:05,415
The climate in Rome is less bracing
than Schenectady.

644
00:59:05,589 --> 00:59:08,786
Especially in winter.
That's where we live, Schenectady.

645
00:59:08,959 --> 00:59:13,623
I haven't found anyone like Dr Davis
and I don't believe I will.

646
00:59:13,797 --> 00:59:16,857
Schenectady thinks everything
of Dr Davis.

647
00:59:17,033 --> 00:59:20,025
There's nothing he wouldn't do for me.

648
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:30,041
- Your friend hasn't moved all evening.
- Really?

649
00:59:30,213 --> 00:59:33,512
- Why don't you break in?
- She's a disgrace.

650
00:59:33,683 --> 00:59:38,677
<i>Mrs Walker, thank you for
a serata absolutely delizioso.</i>

651
00:59:38,855 --> 00:59:41,847
I'm so glad you managed to come.
So nice of you.

652
00:59:42,025 --> 00:59:45,654
So nice of you. So nice to see you.

653
00:59:48,431 --> 00:59:50,524
Mother's probably tired.

654
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:54,033
Here she is.
Mother, I know you're exhausted.

655
00:59:54,204 --> 00:59:56,695
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight. Goodnight.

656
00:59:56,873 --> 00:59:58,864
Goodnight.

657
01:00:00,677 --> 01:00:05,171
- Such a beautiful party.
- Thank you so much. Goodnight.

658
01:00:05,348 --> 01:00:09,341
Goodnight. We had ever so nice a time.
I'm sorry we...

659
01:00:10,553 --> 01:00:12,680
We had a beautiful time.

660
01:00:12,856 --> 01:00:16,087
Though I let Daisy
come to parties without me,

661
01:00:16,259 --> 01:00:19,820
I certainly don't want her
to leave them without me.

662
01:00:19,996 --> 01:00:23,557
<i>- Buonanotte.
- Goodnight.</i>

663
01:00:29,306 --> 01:00:31,570
That was very cruel.

664
01:00:33,343 --> 01:00:36,335
She never enters
my drawing room again.

665
01:02:11,741 --> 01:02:14,642
That's why you've been so pensive, eh?

666
01:02:14,811 --> 01:02:18,372
- Have I been pensive?
- Preoccupied, anyway.

667
01:02:18,548 --> 01:02:23,417
- You were supposed to come by for me.
- I thought we were to meet here.

668
01:02:23,586 --> 01:02:27,147
- Your mind's on other things.
- I don't know what.

669
01:02:27,323 --> 01:02:30,850
- Miss Baker or what's her name?
- Miss Miller.

670
01:02:31,027 --> 01:02:36,363
- Her intrigue with that...barber's block.
- With so much publicity?

671
01:02:36,533 --> 01:02:40,469
- That's their folly.
- I don't think there's any intrigue.

672
01:02:40,637 --> 01:02:44,471
They say
she's quite carried away by him.

673
01:02:44,641 --> 01:02:47,303
They're certainly as thick as thieves.

674
01:02:49,612 --> 01:02:52,308
- He's very handsome.
- Do you think so?

675
01:02:52,482 --> 01:02:57,613
It's easy to see how it is.
She thinks him the finest gentleman.

676
01:02:57,787 --> 01:03:04,090
He's better even than the courier.
The courier probably introduced them.

677
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:08,492
Expects a commission
if the fellow succeeds in marrying her.

678
01:03:08,665 --> 01:03:14,160
- She has no thought of marrying him.
- I'm not sure she's capable of thought.

679
01:03:14,337 --> 01:03:16,965
I certainly see no evidence of it.

680
01:03:17,974 --> 01:03:21,034
She romps on from day to day,
from hour to hour,

681
01:03:21,211 --> 01:03:23,645
as they did in the Golden Age.

682
01:03:23,813 --> 01:03:26,748
I can imagine nothing more vulgar.

683
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:33,613
No, I'm sure that's more than
Giovanelli expects. The little Roman.

684
01:03:33,790 --> 01:03:38,318
She will be telling you at any moment
that she is engaged.

685
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:40,486
Depend on it.

686
01:03:42,165 --> 01:03:45,623
He's perfectly respectable.
A lawyer, I think.

687
01:03:45,802 --> 01:03:48,532
Though he doesn't move
in the best circles.

688
01:03:48,705 --> 01:03:53,438
She must seem wonderfully interesting.
But he can't really hope to pull it off.

689
01:03:53,610 --> 01:03:58,274
That's too impossible a piece of luck.
He hasn't even a title.

690
01:03:58,448 --> 01:04:03,613
<i>- If he were a marchese, even a count...
- Or indeed anyone at all.</i>

691
01:04:16,366 --> 01:04:19,699
Wouldn't it be funny
if they were perfectly innocent

692
01:04:19,869 --> 01:04:22,861
and had no idea
the impression they're creating?

693
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:25,405
No, it wouldn't be funny.

694
01:05:39,849 --> 01:05:43,683
- If it isn't Mr Winterbourne!
- Good afternoon!

695
01:05:43,853 --> 01:05:46,014
- Am I interrupting?
- Not at all.

696
01:05:46,189 --> 01:05:50,125
Mr Giovanelli's learning
an American song. Come in.

697
01:05:50,293 --> 01:05:52,921
Sit down. I want you to hear this.

698
01:05:53,096 --> 01:05:56,691
- Mr Giovanelli will now sing...
- No, is not possible.

699
01:05:56,866 --> 01:06:00,859
- Is possible. Hurry, Mr Winterbourne.
- Is Randolph out?

700
01:06:01,037 --> 01:06:03,437
Eugenio's taken him and Mother
to buy shoes.

701
01:06:03,606 --> 01:06:09,306
Randolph's coming out of his shoes.
Mr Winterbourne, will you sit down?

702
01:06:11,381 --> 01:06:14,248
- We're waiting.
- No, you sing your song.

703
01:06:14,417 --> 01:06:17,215
The most difficult song I never hear.

704
01:06:17,387 --> 01:06:22,051
Ever hear. Come on, we're waiting.
Mr Winterbourne is getting impatient.

705
01:06:22,225 --> 01:06:25,558
- Please, you ask her to sing.
- I'd enjoy that.

706
01:06:25,728 --> 01:06:29,926
You think so? First, we're going to hear
Mr Giovanelli.

707
01:06:30,099 --> 01:06:33,398
- Then maybe I'll sing.
- She is always winning.

708
01:06:33,569 --> 01:06:37,266
- I have no doubt.
- Ready? Here we go.

709
01:07:10,073 --> 01:07:12,064
Bravo! Encore!

710
01:07:12,241 --> 01:07:16,302
No, I think he has heard me.
I play for you now.

711
01:07:16,479 --> 01:07:18,709
- Would you like that?
- Very much.

712
01:07:18,881 --> 01:07:21,145
All right.

713
01:08:34,924 --> 01:08:38,553
- Here's Mother.
- Good afternoon, Mrs Miller.

714
01:08:38,728 --> 01:08:41,754
- Is Randolph here?
- I thought he was with you.

715
01:08:41,931 --> 01:08:46,231
He just ran right out of the store.
Eugenio's looking for him.

716
01:08:46,402 --> 01:08:50,930
I thought maybe he came home.
That boy will be the death of me.

717
01:08:51,107 --> 01:08:54,543
Is there something I can do?
Allow me. Please.

718
01:08:54,710 --> 01:08:58,578
- So many bits and pieces.
- He has the best manners.

719
01:08:58,748 --> 01:09:03,583
- Excuse me.
- Mr Giovanelli's gonna sing for you both.

720
01:09:03,753 --> 01:09:08,622
She's always teasing poor Mr Giovanelli.
I don't know how he stands it.

721
01:09:08,791 --> 01:09:12,420
- But they're always together.
- They're very intimate.

722
01:09:12,595 --> 01:09:15,826
It's as if they couldn't live
without each other.

723
01:09:15,998 --> 01:09:20,435
- But I guess I have the joke on Daisy.
- The joke?

724
01:09:20,603 --> 01:09:25,802
- That she must be engaged.
- How does your daughter take the joke?

725
01:09:25,975 --> 01:09:28,910
- She says she ain't.
- I see.

726
01:09:29,078 --> 01:09:32,741
- She might as well be.
- I'm afraid I must be going.

727
01:09:32,915 --> 01:09:35,713
Mr Giovanelli has promised to tell me.

728
01:09:35,885 --> 01:09:38,854
I'd want to write Mr Miller about it.

729
01:09:39,021 --> 01:09:42,582
Perhaps you'll say
goodbye to Daisy for me.

730
01:09:42,758 --> 01:09:47,161
If you see Randolph,
please tell him to come home right away.

731
01:09:47,330 --> 01:09:50,322
- Of course. Good day.
- Good day.

732
01:09:55,304 --> 01:09:59,070
- Randolph! Where's Eugenio?
- Looking for me.

733
01:10:12,121 --> 01:10:14,385
Mr Winterbourne.

734
01:10:17,059 --> 01:10:20,722
- I should think you'd be lonesome.
- Lonesome?

735
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:27,062
- Can't you get anyone to walk with you?
- I'm not as lucky as your companion.

736
01:10:27,236 --> 01:10:30,933
- You think I go out too much with him.
- Everyone does.

737
01:10:31,107 --> 01:10:36,272
They're only pretending to be shocked.
They don't care a straw what I do.

738
01:10:36,445 --> 01:10:40,176
You'll find they do.
And they'll show it unpleasantly.

739
01:10:40,349 --> 01:10:44,251
They're not inviting you places.
Haven't you noticed anything?

740
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:48,083
I noticed you and that you are
as stiff as a ramrod.

741
01:10:48,257 --> 01:10:52,557
You'll find I'm not half as stiff as some.
Try going to see them.

742
01:10:52,728 --> 01:10:55,959
- What will they do?
- Give you the cold shoulder.

743
01:10:56,132 --> 01:10:59,624
- You know what that means?
- What Mrs Walker did?

744
01:10:59,802 --> 01:11:02,999
I wouldn't think
you'd let people be so unkind.

745
01:11:03,172 --> 01:11:07,108
- I'd think you'd wanna say something.
- I do.

746
01:11:07,276 --> 01:11:10,939
- Do you?
- I want to say...

747
01:11:12,815 --> 01:11:14,806
Yes?

748
01:11:16,953 --> 01:11:20,650
Your mother says
she believes you're engaged.

749
01:11:20,823 --> 01:11:23,417
I guess she does.

750
01:11:24,860 --> 01:11:29,058
- Does Randolph believe it?
- He doesn't believe anything.

751
01:11:32,668 --> 01:11:35,933
But since you've mentioned it,
I am engaged.

752
01:11:37,473 --> 01:11:41,500
- You don't believe it.
- Yes, I do.

753
01:11:44,714 --> 01:11:47,444
<i>- For you.
- Grazie.</i>

754
01:11:47,617 --> 01:11:51,109
- You would walk with us?
- No, thank you.

755
01:11:53,289 --> 01:11:58,727
No, you don't believe it.
But if you possibly do, I'm not.

756
01:12:15,811 --> 01:12:21,545
She wants me to come to Geneva.
Her brats are at school there. Freddie?

757
01:12:21,717 --> 01:12:24,208
You didn't say ten words at dinner.

758
01:12:24,387 --> 01:12:27,550
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

759
01:12:27,723 --> 01:12:30,191
- I saw her today.
- Where?

760
01:12:30,359 --> 01:12:34,022
- At the Doria Palace.
- Was she alone?

761
01:12:34,196 --> 01:12:39,190
No. With that Italian who always
has a stack of flowers in his buttonhole.

762
01:12:39,368 --> 01:12:43,634
- She's certainly pretty.
- Yes. She's a mystery.

763
01:12:43,806 --> 01:12:47,936
- What?
- I can't decide if she's reckless or...

764
01:12:48,110 --> 01:12:50,977
- Innocent?
- Yes, I suppose.

765
01:12:51,147 --> 01:12:53,809
No one can say you aren't gallant.

766
01:12:53,983 --> 01:12:59,546
I hear she's about at all hours with him
and not always in refined surroundings.

767
01:12:59,722 --> 01:13:03,715
Maybe she's just an American girl
and that's that.

768
01:13:03,893 --> 01:13:08,262
What do you say we both
go back to Geneva this summer?

769
01:13:08,431 --> 01:13:14,336
Whatever it is I've missed about her,
it's too late now.

770
01:13:14,503 --> 01:13:17,336
She's carried away with Giovanelli.

771
01:13:17,506 --> 01:13:19,997
I don't think you've missed a thing.

772
01:13:21,010 --> 01:13:24,707
- I'd like to walk the rest of the way.
- Are you sure?

773
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:28,816
Yes. It's such a lovely evening.
I feel like some air.

774
01:13:30,419 --> 01:13:35,550
See you at the opera next week.
Cheer up. It'll be a grand summer.

775
01:16:10,946 --> 01:16:14,507
He looks at us like those old lions
must have looked at the Christians.

776
01:16:14,683 --> 01:16:18,813
Let's hope he isn't hungry.
He eats me first and you for dessert.

777
01:16:19,855 --> 01:16:24,815
Why, that was Mr Winterbourne.
He sees me and he cuts me dead.

778
01:16:32,201 --> 01:16:38,333
- How long have you been here?
- I guess all evening.

779
01:16:38,507 --> 01:16:40,498
I see.

780
01:16:42,044 --> 01:16:44,706
I never saw anything so quaint.

781
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:48,907
You won't think an attack of malaria
is very quaint.

782
01:16:49,084 --> 01:16:53,919
This is just the way people catch it.
I'm surprised a Roman could be so rash.

783
01:16:54,089 --> 01:16:58,958
- For myself I have no fear.
- I'm speaking for this young lady.

784
01:16:59,128 --> 01:17:01,688
I assured Miss Miller
it was an indiscretion.

785
01:17:01,864 --> 01:17:05,265
- I'm never sick and don't mean to be.
- But when was mademoiselle ever...

786
01:17:05,434 --> 01:17:10,167
I'm as healthy as a horse. I was bound to
see the Colosseum by moonlight.

787
01:17:10,339 --> 01:17:12,899
We've had the most beautiful time.

788
01:17:13,075 --> 01:17:16,806
If there's any danger,
Eugenio's got some pills.

789
01:17:16,979 --> 01:17:21,939
- I advise you to go home and take one.
- What he says is very good.

790
01:17:22,117 --> 01:17:24,779
I go to see if the couriers are there.

791
01:17:41,470 --> 01:17:44,906
The Colosseum
is one thing I can rave about.

792
01:17:45,074 --> 01:17:48,441
There ain't no Colosseum
in Schenectady yet.

793
01:17:51,547 --> 01:17:54,038
Why are you always so stiff?

794
01:17:59,221 --> 01:18:02,588
Did you believe I was engaged
the other day?

795
01:18:02,758 --> 01:18:06,558
It doesn't matter now
what I believed the other day.

796
01:18:06,729 --> 01:18:09,289
What do you believe now?

797
01:18:09,465 --> 01:18:14,767
I believe it makes very little difference
whether you're engaged or not.

798
01:18:21,210 --> 01:18:25,704
Quick. If we are home by midnight,
we are quite safe.

799
01:18:35,491 --> 01:18:37,652
Don't forget Eugenio's pills.

800
01:18:37,826 --> 01:18:41,091
I don't care if I have
the Roman fever or not.

801
01:20:21,363 --> 01:20:23,354
It's just too terrible.

802
01:20:23,532 --> 01:20:28,697
I heard she spent the entire night
with that man, alone. Just imagine.

803
01:20:28,871 --> 01:20:33,205
- It was after midnight when she got in.
- I blame the mother.

804
01:20:33,375 --> 01:20:37,311
- I blame them both.
- Freddie. Freddie!

805
01:20:39,414 --> 01:20:43,214
- Where have you been all week?
- I went to the seashore.

806
01:20:43,385 --> 01:20:47,788
I'm going to Geneva. I just came by
to say goodbye to my aunt.

807
01:20:47,956 --> 01:20:51,756
And Mrs Walker, I hope.
She's over there. Will you?

808
01:20:51,927 --> 01:20:54,259
- Yes, alarmingly ill, I hear.
- Is she in hospital?

809
01:20:54,429 --> 01:20:58,695
No, her mother's taking care of her,
but she's seen several doctors.

810
01:20:58,867 --> 01:21:02,234
- I must say I'm not surprised.
- Charles.

811
01:21:02,404 --> 01:21:04,838
What do you hear about Daisy Miller?

812
01:21:05,007 --> 01:21:07,703
That's right, you haven't heard.

813
01:21:07,876 --> 01:21:12,176
The silly girl's caught the Roman fever.
They say she's very ill.

814
01:21:12,347 --> 01:21:15,748
Freddie! Where are you going? Freddie.

815
01:21:19,888 --> 01:21:25,121
It's going around at night that way,
that's what made her so sick.

816
01:21:26,628 --> 01:21:30,428
She's always going around at night.
I wouldn't think she'd want to.

817
01:21:30,599 --> 01:21:35,764
It's so blasted dark over here, you can't
see anything unless the moon's up.

818
01:21:36,471 --> 01:21:38,996
It's not like that in America.

819
01:21:42,578 --> 01:21:46,105
Ain't that right, Eugenio?
It's so dark over here.

820
01:21:56,592 --> 01:22:00,688
- Randolph, aren't you in bed yet?
- I'm going.

821
01:22:15,244 --> 01:22:17,508
Thank you very much.

822
01:22:17,679 --> 01:22:20,170
- Mrs Miller.
- Why, Mr Winterbourne.

823
01:22:20,349 --> 01:22:24,877
Excuse my coming so late.
I only just heard. How is she?

824
01:22:25,053 --> 01:22:29,888
The doctor says he can't tell.
I do wish Dr Davis were here.

825
01:22:30,058 --> 01:22:35,690
- Is there anything I can do?
- No, thank you. It's just this fever.

826
01:22:35,864 --> 01:22:40,267
I wish Randolph would go to bed.
But he's been very helpful.

827
01:22:40,435 --> 01:22:42,426
In his way.

828
01:22:42,604 --> 01:22:47,769
That Italian doctor says it's a very
bad case. Her fever's been so high.

829
01:22:47,943 --> 01:22:52,676
I'm sure she'll be better soon. It always
gets very high before it drops.

830
01:22:52,848 --> 01:22:56,875
Daisy spoke of you the other day,
quite pleasantly.

831
01:22:57,052 --> 01:23:00,852
Half the time she doesn't know what
she's saying, but this time I think she did.

832
01:23:01,023 --> 01:23:03,014
She told me to tell you

833
01:23:03,191 --> 01:23:08,322
she never was engaged to that
Mr Giovanelli who was always round.

834
01:23:08,497 --> 01:23:13,161
I'm sure I'm very glad. He hasn't been
near us since she was taken ill.

835
01:23:13,335 --> 01:23:18,363
I thought he was such a gentleman
but I don't call that very polite.

836
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:24,069
I hear he was afraid I didn't approve of
his being with her so much, evenings.

837
01:23:24,246 --> 01:23:28,706
You'd think he knows I'm a lady
and wouldn't raise a fuss.

838
01:23:28,884 --> 01:23:32,012
He underestimates you.

839
01:23:32,187 --> 01:23:36,248
Anyway, she wants you to know
she's not engaged.

840
01:23:36,425 --> 01:23:40,589
She said to me three times,
"Mind you tell Mr Winterbourne."

841
01:23:40,762 --> 01:23:45,756
And she told me to ask if you remember
going to that castle in Switzerland.

842
01:23:45,934 --> 01:23:48,596
I said I wouldn't give any such message.

843
01:23:48,770 --> 01:23:53,264
Only, if she's not engaged,
I guess I'm glad to know it, too.

844
01:24:59,741 --> 01:25:01,606
Amen.

845
01:25:43,485 --> 01:25:48,354
She was the most beautiful young lady
I never see. And...

846
01:25:50,225 --> 01:25:52,557
...the most amiable.

847
01:25:52,727 --> 01:25:55,958
And she was the most innocent.

848
01:25:56,131 --> 01:26:00,500
- The most innocent?
- Yes. The most innocent.

849
01:26:02,938 --> 01:26:06,032
Why the devil
did you take her to that place?

850
01:26:06,208 --> 01:26:10,702
- For myself I had no fear. She...
- Yes?

851
01:26:10,879 --> 01:26:13,439
She did what she liked.

852
01:26:15,951 --> 01:26:18,579
She did what she liked.

853
01:26:18,753 --> 01:26:22,189
If she had lived,
I would have got nothing.

854
01:26:23,191 --> 01:26:26,217
She never would have married me,
I'm sure.

855
01:26:26,394 --> 01:26:31,161
- She never would have married you?
- No. I hoped so, but no.

856
01:26:32,934 --> 01:26:36,734
I'm convinced. I'm sure.

857
01:27:16,444 --> 01:27:18,878
Time to go, I guess.

858
01:27:48,176 --> 01:27:52,636
<i>It's on my conscience, you see.
I'm afraid I did her an injustice.</i>

859
01:27:52,814 --> 01:27:55,715
<i>Did you? How?</i>

860
01:27:55,884 --> 01:27:58,182
<i>She sent me a message
before she died.</i>

861
01:27:58,353 --> 01:28:03,757
<i>I didn't understand it at the time,
but I've understood it since.</i>

862
01:28:03,925 --> 01:28:08,624
<i>I think she would have...
appreciated my esteem.</i>

863
01:28:09,631 --> 01:28:11,826
<i>Is that some modest way of saying</i>

864
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:17,336
<i>you think she would have reciprocated
your affection, had you shown it?</i>

865
01:28:18,873 --> 01:28:23,833
<i>You were right, you know.
That remark you made last summer.</i>

866
01:28:24,012 --> 01:28:27,504
<i>I was booked to make a mistake.</i>

867
01:28:27,682 --> 01:28:30,845
<i>I've lived too long in foreign parts.</i>
