After taking my undergraduate degree
at Bowdoin...

182
00:11:57,926 --> 00:12:00,846
I received my doctorate
from the Bussey Institute at Harvard.

183
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:03,557
<i>I took a position</i>

185

a far more fascinating insect.

<i>[Kinsey] This is the American</i> Cynipidae,

190

into its host plant.

191
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:25,078
<i>In this case, an oak tree.</i>

192

<i>The adult wasp chews its way</i>
<i>through the tree...</i>

00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,794
<i>and copulates.</i>

194
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,423

it has the good sense to die.

195

So, what makes the gall wasp
so fascinating?

198
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,645

collecting gall wasps.

Consider the implications.

210

If every single living thing is different
from every other living thing...

They have great big wings,
but they can't fly.

They are incapable of getting
from this hill to that hill...

unless it's close enough to walk...

232
00:14:46,762 --> 00:14:49,348

You have better things to do...

00:57:29,533 --> 00:57:32,411
than help a middle-aged woman home
with her groceries.

934
00:57:32,536 --> 00:57:35,414
Prok got worried
when he couldn't reach you.

935
00:57:35,539 --> 00:57:38,417
Said he had to take histories
later this evening...

936
00:57:38,542 --> 00:57:40,669
so he'd like an early dinner.

937
00:57:40,794 --> 00:57:42,671
- Hmph.
- Preferably 5:00.

938
00:57:42,796 --> 00:57:45,174
Hardly gives me time to boil an egg.

939
00:57:45,299 --> 00:57:47,176
- Can I help?
- No. I'll manage.

940
00:57:47,301 --> 00:57:50,179
I just... I'm sorry
he made you play messenger.

941
00:57:50,304 --> 00:57:52,431
No. I volunteered.

942
00:57:54,683 --> 00:57:56,602
Mmm.

943
00:57:59,813 --> 00:58:01,690
Hear that?

944
00:58:01,815 --> 00:58:04,401

- The sound of an empty nest.

946
00:58:07,946 --> 00:58:10,908
Must be a big adjustment.
Have you heard from Bruce yet?

947
00:58:10,991 --> 00:58:13,285
No. He's loving college.

948
00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:15,621
Maybe it's just
being away from here.

949
00:58:15,704 --> 00:58:18,665

- Would you like a piece of pie?

00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:21,251
- Rhubarb?
- Have a seat.

951
00:58:27,007 --> 00:58:30,469
You know, Clyde,
I didn't like you very much at first.

952
00:58:31,637 --> 00:58:33,597
I don't blame you.

953
00:58:33,722 --> 00:58:37,518
- Most women would have had me murdered.
- Oh, I considered it.

954
00:58:37,643 --> 00:58:39,770
I hate to think of myself
as conventional.

955
00:58:40,979 --> 00:58:43,857
But if this had to happen...

956
00:58:45,651 --> 00:58:48,111
I'm glad it was you.

957
00:58:48,237 --> 00:58:51,990
And I... have to admit
there have been some benefits.

958
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:56,954
It certainly sparked things up sexually.

959
00:58:57,037 --> 00:58:59,831
I suppose we'd both grown bored
without even realizing it.

960
00:59:01,708 --> 00:59:03,627
I think you've handled it
remarkably well.

961
00:59:04,795 --> 00:59:06,755
I learned something a long time ago.

962
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,550
Once Prok has his mind set,
it's no use trying to stop him.

963
00:59:10,717 --> 00:59:12,803
Yes.

967
00:59:24,898 --> 00:59:29,069
You know, this thing
between Prok and me...

968
00:59:30,279 --> 00:59:32,739

of course.

975
01:00:11,069 --> 01:00:14,698

- Oh, definitely just you and I.

976
01:00:15,908 --> 01:00:18,285
Oh, I think I might like that.

<i>into 200 major social subgroups.</i>

1017

01:02:43,514 --> 01:02:46,517
most of the basic questions

There are those who argue that...

<i>things beyond your training</i>
<i>as a zoologist.</i>

That is, it's really a very stupid way

<i>One of the aims of science</i>

And this team you're proposing?

I'll need two pair of hands at least...
both with advanced degrees in science.

1044

needs to have motives that are entirely pure

Science is always interested

1055

<i>Yes, but it's advisable</i>
<i>to stick to what's normal.</i>

You don't want to shake people up.

1057

Of course not.
I'm just a taxonomist... a measurer.

1058
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:57,564
I'm happy to leave

<i>Very good.</i>

So, if you're ready...

1062
01:05:06,615 --> 01:05:08,825
I'd like to begin with
a few background questions.

1063
01:05:08,951 --> 01:05:10,369
<i>No. All wrong. Start by putting</i>

- Why, a glass of water would be very nice.

1066
01:05:17,334 --> 01:05:19,670
Do anything fun this weekend?

1067
01:05:19,753 --> 01:05:21,713
My daughters were in town,
so I never stopped.

1068
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:24,258
We had a marvelous meal
Saturday night.

1069
01:05:24,383 --> 01:05:26,510

See how much more relaxed
she's become?

1071
01:05:28,679 --> 01:05:30,556
If you ease in
with innocuous questions...

1072
01:05:30,681 --> 01:05:32,933
people forget
they're giving sex histories.

1073
01:05:33,058 --> 01:05:35,269
How did you first
find out about masturbation?

1074
01:05:35,394 --> 01:05:37,396
I invented it, son.

1075
01:05:37,521 --> 01:05:40,524
Sometimes I tie a rope

as much as I do?

1664

<i>Squiggly lines, empty canvases,</i>
<i>white on white.</i>

So, the next book will deal
with sex offenders?

1666
01:44:51,208 --> 01:44:53,168
We need money, Mrs. Hartford.

1667
01:44:54,586 --> 01:44:56,463
We...

1668
01:44:58,090 --> 01:45:01,260
<i>- [Dishes Clatter]</i>
- We need someone to give us money.

<i>You have no idea</i>
<i>what I've had to endure...</i>

1670
01:45:04,555 --> 01:45:07,975
just to obtain the same rights
other scientists take for granted.

1671
01:45:08,100 --> 01:45:12,855
My funding has been slashed, and my name
has been dragged through the mud...

1672
01:45:12,938 --> 01:45:16,441
in every newspaper and magazine
across this country.

1673
01:45:18,402 --> 01:45:21,446

Leave me alone!

1674

<i>[Clears Throat] Every dollar I've ever</i>

1675
01:45:28,203 --> 01:45:33,083
But fighting this customs case has cost us
an appalling amount. We're broke.

<i>- Please.</i>

01:45:35,502 --> 01:45:38,088
I'm not even sure
how much time I have left.

1678
01:45:38,172 --> 01:45:41,175
Help me.
I have to get it all on the record.

1679
01:45:41,300 --> 01:45:43,468
Well, I'm very sorry.

1680

<i>Any support I give might be misconstrued</i>

1682
01:45:51,268 --> 01:45:53,145

1686

1688
01:46:25,886 --> 01:46:28,430
No. No more beds.

1689
01:46:29,556 --> 01:46:33,060
I spent my whole childhood
lying in bed.

1690
01:46:39,858 --> 01:46:42,819
Let's go back to the hotel, Mac.

1691
01:46:42,903 --> 01:46:45,864
I wanna pick up a few histories
in the morning.

01:46:51,954 --> 01:46:55,499
<i>[Woman] We'd been married for 23 years,</i>
<i>with three marvelous children.</i>

1695
01:46:56,750 --> 01:46:59,503
And as soon as my youngest
left to go to college...

1696
01:46:59,628 --> 01:47:04,049
I took a job in an arts foundation.

1697
01:47:09,221 --> 01:47:11,098
I met a woman there...

1698
01:47:11,223 --> 01:47:13,642
secretary in the grants office.

1699
01:47:19,356 --> 01:47:21,733
We became fast friends, and...

1700
01:47:26,405 --> 01:47:28,699
before long,
I fell in love with her.

1701
01:47:32,911 --> 01:47:37,708
Hmm. This came as quite a shock,
as you might imagine.

1702
01:47:39,001 --> 01:47:40,919
The more I tried to ignore it...

1703
01:47:41,003 --> 01:47:44,089
the more... powerful it became.

1704
01:47:49,219 --> 01:47:51,555
You have no idea...

1705
01:47:51,638 --> 01:47:53,932
what it's like
to have your own thoughts...

1706
01:47:54,057 --> 01:47:57,519
turn against you like that.

1707
01:47:57,603 --> 01:48:00,522
I couldn't talk to anyone
about my situation...

1708
01:48:00,606 --> 01:48:03,734
so I found other ways to cope.

1709
01:48:09,156 --> 01:48:12,826
[Sniffles]
Uh, I took up drinking.

1710
01:48:14,578 --> 01:48:18,457
Eventually, my husband left me.

1711
01:48:18,540 --> 01:48:21,001
Even my children fell away.

1712
01:48:23,378 --> 01:48:27,090
[Voice Breaking]
I came very close to... ending it all.

1713
01:48:31,762 --> 01:48:33,805
It's just another reminder
of how little...

1714
01:48:33,931 --> 01:48:37,809
things have changed in our society.

1715
01:48:37,893 --> 01:48:41,230
What are you talking about?
Things have gotten much better.

1716
01:48:43,148 --> 01:48:45,025
Oh? What happened?

1717
01:48:46,652 --> 01:48:48,654
Why, you did, of course.

1718
01:48:48,737 --> 01:48:51,865
<i>After I read your book, I realized...</i>

1719
01:48:51,990 --> 01:48:55,786
<i>how many other women</i>
<i>were in the same situation.</i>

1720
01:48:55,869 --> 01:48:59,122
I mustered the courage
to talk to my friend...

1721
01:48:59,248 --> 01:49:04,378
and she told me,
to my great surprise...

1722
01:49:04,503 --> 01:49:07,756
that the feelings were mutual.

1723
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:12,302
We-We've been together
for three happy years now.

1724
01:49:30,571 --> 01:49:32,406
You saved my life, sir.

1725
01:49:41,790 --> 01:49:43,709
<i>[Martin]</i>
<i>Just, uh, one more question.</i>

1726

<i>childhood, family, career...</i>

<i>every person you've ever had sex with...</i>

1729
01:49:52,342 --> 01:49:55,095
but there hasn't been
a single mention of love.

1730
01:49:55,220 --> 01:49:59,308
That's because it's impossible
to measure love.

1731
01:49:59,391 --> 01:50:02,519
And as you know, without measurements,
there can be no science.

1732
01:50:03,896 --> 01:50:06,857
But I've been thinking a lot
about the problem lately.

1733
01:50:06,982 --> 01:50:08,942
Oh. Problem?

1734
01:50:09,067 --> 01:50:12,738

we're all in the dark.

No, not that I recall.

<i>stuck in one place.</i>

But I've never seen
a discontented tree.

1756

Look at this one... the way its roots
are gripping the ground.

1757
