1
00:00:22,819 --> 00:00:25,370
The history of man is defined by war.

2
00:00:26,778 --> 00:00:29,616
And war by the men who fight it.

3
00:00:30,757 --> 00:00:33,458
What if we could create a better man?

4
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,433
Someone did.

5
00:00:36,274 --> 00:00:40,713
The Agent program was
initiated in August of 1967...

6
00:00:40,714 --> 00:00:43,401
by a man named Peter Aaron Litvenko.

7
00:00:44,302 --> 00:00:48,242
It's purpose was to create
the perfect killing machine.

8
00:00:48,243 --> 00:00:53,115
Human beings without emotion,
or fear, or remorse.

9
00:00:54,802 --> 00:00:57,587
The resulting subjects were called Agents.

10
00:00:59,483 --> 00:01:01,979
The Program was a success.

11
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:07,319
But the price of creating men without
humanity, was Litvenko's conscience.

12
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:11,425
Applying his brilliant mind
to his flight, he vanished.

13
00:01:11,826 --> 00:01:15,643
Fearing that it would be exposed,
the Govt shut down the Program.

14
00:01:15,845 --> 00:01:19,128
And surviving Agents drifted
into shadows.

15
00:01:19,928 --> 00:01:23,706
Realizing it's potential, many
tried to re-start the Program.

16
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,277
All failed.

17
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,553
So they focused their efforts
on finding the one man who could.

18
00:01:34,254 --> 00:01:37,509
The task fell to
Dr. Albert Delriego.

19
00:01:37,809 --> 00:01:40,412
A ruthless, and efficient man.

20
00:01:42,528 --> 00:01:46,781
Bu Litvenko had disappeared
and even he couldn't find him.

21
00:01:48,974 --> 00:01:52,002
Then, 6 years into his search...

22
00:01:52,003 --> 00:01:55,217
Delriego made an unexpected discovery.

23
00:01:57,016 --> 00:02:01,827
A single photograph, which would
become the key to finding Litvenko.

24
00:02:03,267 --> 00:02:05,942
No-one had ever imagined,
that in the end...

25
00:02:07,675 --> 00:02:11,311
it would come down
to one, little .. girl.

160
00:24:58,216 --> 00:24:59,216
Let's go!

161
00:25:07,614 --> 00:25:09,070
We'll be safe here.

162
00:25:09,896 --> 00:25:13,956
<b>EMBASSY OF
THE UNITED STATES OF AMÉRICA</b>

163
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:15,921
<i>Identificatión, please.</i>

164
00:25:15,922 --> 00:25:17,792
<i>Purses open and in plain sight,
please.</i>

165
00:25:21,135 --> 00:25:22,595
<i>Put down your weapon!</i>

166
00:25:23,149 --> 00:25:25,134
On the ground!
Hands where we can see them!

167
00:25:25,135 --> 00:25:26,761
- Don't move!
- Cuff them!

168
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:30,971
You're coming with me.
Grab the pack.

169
00:25:32,394 --> 00:25:33,394
Move!

170
00:25:59,904 --> 00:26:02,326
Miss Van Dees, is it?

171
00:26:04,783 --> 00:26:07,614
You mind telling me why you're here?
Because your friend in there wouldn't talk.

172
00:26:07,615 --> 00:26:10,591
He's not my friend.
I don't know who he is.

173
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:12,587
Alright.

174
00:26:12,588 --> 00:26:17,560
Maybe we can start with why he discharged
a firearm in from of my embassy.

175
00:26:18,224 --> 00:26:19,759
Soemone was trying...

176
00:26:19,982 --> 00:26:22,408
I think that someone
was trying to kill me.

177
00:26:23,952 --> 00:26:26,718
John was trying to .. help me.

178
00:26:28,968 --> 00:26:31,198
Does this someone have a name?

179
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:39,613
Something wrong, Miss van Dees?

180
00:26:41,605 --> 00:26:43,002
<i>Miss van Dees.</i>

181
00:26:44,172 --> 00:26:45,415
He's coming.

182
00:26:49,704 --> 00:26:50,904
Shit.

183
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:05,250
Freeze!

184
00:27:05,899 --> 00:27:06,926
Hands in the air!

185
00:27:10,904 --> 00:27:11,904
Sanders.

186
00:27:27,705 --> 00:27:30,581
Blaser R93 LRS2 rifle.

187
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:32,896
Custom configured right hand twist.

188
00:27:34,227 --> 00:27:38,595
4-24x50 sniper scope, and...

189
00:27:40,413 --> 00:27:41,851
hair trigger.

190
00:27:42,152 --> 00:27:43,369
Very nice.

191
00:27:44,647 --> 00:27:45,647
Come here.

192
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:47,900
<i>Almost as the nice as 45s...</i>

193
00:27:47,901 --> 00:27:51,063
<i>and these very special knives
you walked in here with.</i>

194
00:27:52,727 --> 00:27:54,450
<i>You like riddles?</i>

195
00:27:55,151 --> 00:27:56,612
<i>Yeah, me neither.</i>

196
00:27:56,913 --> 00:27:58,611
I hate them actually.

197
00:27:58,978 --> 00:28:02,454
But you, my friend,
are a riddle to me.

198
00:28:02,528 --> 00:28:06,253
<i>Because I've run your face and prints
through every database we have.</i>

199
00:28:06,488 --> 00:28:07,923
And you know what we found?

200
00:28:08,914 --> 00:28:10,006
Nothing.

201
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:15,096
So...

202
00:28:15,297 --> 00:28:17,537
Why don't we start with your name?

203
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,991
47.

204
00:28:22,303 --> 00:28:23,461
That's not a name.

205
00:28:23,662 --> 00:28:24,912
No...

206
00:28:25,072 --> 00:28:27,090
But it is mine.

207
00:28:28,157 --> 00:28:29,157
Okay.

208
00:28:29,753 --> 00:28:31,814
Alright, Mr. 47.

209
00:28:32,182 --> 00:28:34,195
What exactly are you?

210
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:35,671
An assassin.

211
00:28:36,205 --> 00:28:38,449
An assassin, okay.

212
00:28:38,825 --> 00:28:41,913
And you're here to kill who, exactly?

213
00:28:42,696 --> 00:28:44,741
You have a girl here.

214
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,299
I don't know what you're talking about.

215
00:28:47,681 --> 00:28:49,761
Do you love your family?

216
00:28:51,076 --> 00:28:52,596
My family?

217
00:28:52,631 --> 00:28:53,668
Yes, your wife...

218
00:28:53,884 --> 00:28:55,686
two small children.

219
00:28:56,187 --> 00:28:57,459
You love them?

220
00:28:58,602 --> 00:29:00,886
We're not talking about me,
we're talking about you.

221
00:29:00,921 --> 00:29:02,988
No, we're talking about life.

222
00:29:03,023 --> 00:29:04,499
And death.

223
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:07,923
Do .. you .. love them?

224
00:29:09,138 --> 00:29:10,493
Alright.

225
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:13,790
- Maybe we should start over.
- I believe you do.

226
00:29:15,409 --> 00:29:17,823
That's why, you should let me go.

227
00:29:19,075 --> 00:29:24,014
Now you listen to me very carefully
Mr 47, or whatever the fuck your name is.

228
00:29:24,437 --> 00:29:27,582
There's a lot of ways that this
can end and that's entirely up to you

229
00:29:27,583 --> 00:29:32,080
But you can be goddamn certain
that it's not gonna end the way you

230
00:29:32,081 --> 00:29:33,695
Because the last time I checked...

231
00:29:33,696 --> 00:29:37,294
You're locked in here with me,
and I'm the one with a gun.

232
00:29:38,035 --> 00:29:40,792
No, Mr. Sanders.

233
00:29:41,556 --> 00:29:43,743
You are locked in here with me...

234
00:29:44,258 --> 00:29:46,727
And you just brought me mine.

235
00:30:09,739 --> 00:30:12,313
Do you love your children
enough to die for them?

236
00:30:22,841 --> 00:30:23,841
Freeze!

237
00:30:30,581 --> 00:30:32,476
Let's go.
Let me help you.

238
00:30:36,928 --> 00:30:39,221
<i>Two suspects
one male one female...</i>

239
00:30:39,222 --> 00:30:41,767
<i>Broke out of
Interrogation rooms 1 and 2.</i>

240
00:30:43,298 --> 00:30:46,214
<i>They're armed and dangerous.
Proceed with caution.</i>

241
00:30:52,436 --> 00:30:53,436
Sargent.

242
00:30:55,309 --> 00:30:56,765
Is everything alright, sir?

243
00:30:58,246 --> 00:30:59,346
Sir?

244
00:31:01,641 --> 00:31:03,376
Hurry! Hurry!

245
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:14,170
Get out!

246
00:31:14,427 --> 00:31:15,527
Move!

247
00:31:33,497 --> 00:31:35,485
You want to tell me
what's happening now?

248
00:31:36,701 --> 00:31:38,465
What the fuck is happening?

249
00:31:39,927 --> 00:31:43,198
The man you're looking for,
his name is Peter Aaron Litvenko.

250
00:31:43,233 --> 00:31:44,368
Who is he?

251
00:31:45,938 --> 00:31:47,502
Your father.

252
00:31:49,971 --> 00:31:51,388
Tell me about him.

253
00:31:52,628 --> 00:31:54,270
I don't know much.

254
00:31:54,384 --> 00:31:57,736
Only that he's a genecist,
an expert on human biogenetics...

255
00:31:57,737 --> 00:32:00,421
who spearheaded a
program of experimentation.

256
00:32:01,149 --> 00:32:03,160
What kind of experiments?

257
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,356
The kind that created killers.

258
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:10,781
<i>The engineered human beings
by targeting specific genes.</i>

259
00:32:10,916 --> 00:32:15,528
The resulting subjects were faster, stronger,
more intelligent than normal people.

260
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,595
They programmed out pain, fear,.

261
00:32:17,596 --> 00:32:18,851
<i>Even love.</i>

262
00:32:18,897 --> 00:32:20,977
<i>They called them Agents.</i>

263
00:32:21,184 --> 00:32:24,549
And your father was one of the
lead scientists of the Program.

264
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:26,244
You can't be serious.

265
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,826
<i>What does this have anything to
do with me?</i>

266
00:32:28,827 --> 00:32:30,478
<i>And why do they want to kill me?</i>

267
00:32:30,479 --> 00:32:33,067
<i>Kriton Technologies
has re-started the Agent Program.</i>

268
00:32:33,068 --> 00:32:34,580
<i>They're building Agents right now.</i>

269
00:32:34,581 --> 00:32:36,264
<i>Like 47, maybe worse.</i>

270
00:32:36,366 --> 00:32:39,579
They belive that you're the
key to finding your father.

271
00:32:42,324 --> 00:32:43,850
<i>I don't understand.</i>

272
00:32:43,851 --> 00:32:45,785
<i>Your father knows their weakness.</i>

273
00:32:45,792 --> 00:32:47,485
He knows how to stop them.

274
00:32:53,458 --> 00:32:54,656
<i>Katia!</i>

275
00:33:35,788 --> 00:33:37,133
You okay?

276
00:33:37,134 --> 00:33:38,135
No.

277
00:33:43,607 --> 00:33:45,969
Is your name really John Smith?

278
00:33:48,728 --> 00:33:50,089
It's Brian.

279
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:54,103
Well, at least you didn't
say I was Agent 46.

280
00:33:54,138 --> 00:33:55,514
No, that's someone else.

281
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,523
Come here. let me help you.

282
00:34:18,881 --> 00:34:20,686
You're going to be alright.

283
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,100
No lie?

284
00:34:25,886 --> 00:34:27,178
I'm sorry.

285
00:34:27,903 --> 00:34:28,903
For what?

286
00:34:29,204 --> 00:34:31,279
For having to tell you
who your father is.

287
00:34:32,514 --> 00:34:34,323
Well, you told me the truth.

288
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:37,270
That's more than anyone ever has.

289
00:34:38,773 --> 00:34:41,613
Why is it that they think
I can find him, John?

290
00:34:42,259 --> 00:34:43,249
Doesn't matter now.

291
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,350
But it does.

292
00:34:45,724 --> 00:34:47,457
Tell me what you know.

293
00:34:48,038 --> 00:34:49,393
I know that you're in danger.

294
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,022
The best thing you could do
right now is hide.

295
00:34:54,236 --> 00:34:56,477
I've been hiding my entire life.
Please...

296
00:34:56,754 --> 00:34:58,070
tell me what you know.

297
00:35:00,991 --> 00:35:02,938
I'm authorized to protect you...

298
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,105
Katia, not find your father.

299
00:35:14,024 --> 00:35:15,024
Don't do this.

300
00:35:15,123 --> 00:35:16,125
I have to.

301
00:35:16,732 --> 00:35:17,732
Okay.

302
00:35:21,774 --> 00:35:24,202
When we were researching your
father, we found a file.

303
00:35:25,725 --> 00:35:27,520
It mentiined you. It said that...

304
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:29,461
Said what?

305
00:35:30,071 --> 00:35:31,366
It said that he changed you.

306
00:35:32,665 --> 00:35:33,965
Changed me, how?

307
00:35:34,066 --> 00:35:36,955
It said that he had enhanced
your survival skills.

308
00:35:37,956 --> 00:35:40,551
It's why we think you've been
hiding...

309
00:35:40,552 --> 00:35:44,844
Why you've been able to stay
off the radar, been to stay alive.

310
00:35:45,516 --> 00:35:47,682
- That's why I was always afraid.
- Yes.

311
00:35:51,654 --> 00:35:52,650
Jesus!

312
00:35:52,652 --> 00:35:54,851
They think I know how to
find my father.

313
00:36:00,847 --> 00:36:01,847
What is this?

314
00:36:02,148 --> 00:36:03,653
It's my father's life.

315
00:36:13,166 --> 00:36:14,827
What else do you know about him?

316
00:36:14,862 --> 00:36:16,088
Just what I told you.

317
00:36:16,153 --> 00:36:18,893
You must have something.
How old is he?

318
00:36:18,994 --> 00:36:19,994
Seventy two.

319
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:21,713
Where was he born?

320
00:36:21,815 --> 00:36:23,105
Ukraine.

321
00:36:24,227 --> 00:36:25,767
Medical conditions?

322
00:36:26,436 --> 00:36:29,742
He was diagnosed with rheumatroid
arthritis in his 40s.

323
00:36:30,623 --> 00:36:32,493
Somewhere warm, then.

324
00:36:34,404 --> 00:36:35,404
What else?

325
00:36:36,717 --> 00:36:37,974
Lung cancer.

326
00:36:41,757 --> 00:36:45,463
Last known sighting was
in a hospital Seúl, Korea in 2011.

327
00:36:46,122 --> 00:36:49,602
He was engaged in some clinical trials...

328
00:36:49,603 --> 00:36:52,183
in something called nanomolecular
inhalation therapy

329
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:56,229
He was stage 3 then.

330
00:36:57,885 --> 00:37:00,559
So, travel will be difficult.

331
00:37:03,087 --> 00:37:04,244
Does he have money?

332
00:37:05,442 --> 00:37:06,706
I think so.

333
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:10,220
Somewhere warm with advanced
medical facilities.

334
00:37:10,221 --> 00:37:11,420
A city.

335
00:37:12,177 --> 00:37:13,177
Hobbies?

336
00:37:17,574 --> 00:37:18,865
What does he love to do?

337
00:37:19,305 --> 00:37:20,306
Orchids.

338
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:24,817
He was an expert in orchids.

339
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:30,974
What languages did he speak, John?

340
00:37:31,811 --> 00:37:35,387
English, Russian, Mandarín and Tamil.

341
00:37:37,652 --> 00:37:38,929
Why Tamil?

342
00:37:39,178 --> 00:37:41,739
Because your mother was from Sri Lanka.

343
00:37:55,544 --> 00:37:57,272
<i>You know where he is, don't you?</i>

344
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:05,749
Katia.

345
00:38:09,005 --> 00:38:11,512
YOu told me you wanted to do this,
and I told you I would do it with you...

346
00:38:11,513 --> 00:38:14,203
but if you want my help, you
have to tell me where he is.

347
00:38:55,926 --> 00:38:57,607
<i>We've lost the girl.</i>

348
00:38:58,007 --> 00:39:03,084
You told me that your John Smith
would be adequate.

349
00:39:03,985 --> 00:39:05,728
<i>We underestimated this Agent.</i>

350
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:10,623
Find Litvenko,
whatever it takes.

351
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:14,504
And, Garad, better this girl dead...

352
00:39:14,605 --> 00:39:17,496
Than this Agent finding Litvenko
before we do.

353
00:39:22,953 --> 00:39:23,954
Katia.

354
00:39:26,435 --> 00:39:27,568
Katia.

355
00:39:40,274 --> 00:39:42,296
Do you know why you're still alive?

356
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:45,607
Because I chose not to kill you.

357
00:39:49,784 --> 00:39:50,997
But they will.

358
00:39:52,442 --> 00:39:54,455
After they use you
to find your father.

359
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:57,622
What do you know about my father?

360
00:40:00,051 --> 00:40:01,347
As much as you do.

361
00:40:03,056 --> 00:40:04,136
<i>Everything will be alright.</i>

362
00:40:05,795 --> 00:40:06,795
<i>No!</i>

363
00:40:11,981 --> 00:40:13,792
Time to make a choice, Katia.

364
00:40:14,397 --> 00:40:17,268
Them or me.

365
00:40:20,195 --> 00:40:21,564
Why should I trust you?

366
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:24,995
You don't have to.
Just trust you memories.

367
00:40:27,149 --> 00:40:28,499
Take my hand.

368
00:40:31,828 --> 00:40:34,928
<i>You remember the day you ran away, Katia?</i>

369
00:40:34,929 --> 00:40:35,931
<i>Peter, we have to go!</i>

370
00:40:35,932 --> 00:40:39,123
<i>Your father's lab?
The car rides?</i>

371
00:40:41,994 --> 00:40:43,095
<i>Easy.</i>

372
00:40:43,096 --> 00:40:45,022
<i>The last time you saw your mother?</i>

373
00:40:45,224 --> 00:40:48,820
<i>No! No, no, no, no!</i>

374
00:40:56,645 --> 00:40:57,965
You were there.

375
00:40:59,556 --> 00:41:00,557
Yes.

376
00:41:02,211 --> 00:41:04,272
<i>Yes, we were part of the same Program.</i>

377
00:41:14,649 --> 00:41:15,923
<i>We have to go.
Quickly!</i>

378
00:41:18,966 --> 00:41:19,966
<i>Run! Quickly!</i>

379
00:41:21,277 --> 00:41:22,720
<i>Good, get down there.
Get down, please!</i>

380
00:41:22,721 --> 00:41:23,721
<i>Papá!</i>

381
00:41:23,722 --> 00:41:25,975
<i>Live.</i>

382
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,717
He left me.
Why?

383
00:41:38,338 --> 00:41:41,136
Find him.
You can ask him yourself.

384
00:41:45,909 --> 00:41:46,953
Untie me.

385
00:41:48,799 --> 00:41:51,925
You have a lot to learn, Katia.
We don't have a lot of time.

386
00:41:52,797 --> 00:41:53,863
Untie yourself.

387
00:43:09,637 --> 00:43:10,757
That took you too long.

388
00:43:11,264 --> 00:43:12,543
I didn't know that was a test.

389
00:43:12,912 --> 00:43:14,073
Everything is a test.

390
00:43:14,274 --> 00:43:16,341
Keep taking these, you'll fail.

391
00:43:16,828 --> 00:43:17,971
Hey, I need them.

392
00:43:18,372 --> 00:43:20,555
What you need is a clear head.

393
00:43:20,826 --> 00:43:22,346
Stop fighting what you are.

394
00:43:22,347 --> 00:43:23,346
And what am I?

395
00:43:23,347 --> 00:43:25,400
Keep asking questions,
you'll probably be dead.

396
00:43:26,785 --> 00:43:27,792
What am I?

397
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,011
You're the same as me, only better.

398
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:33,637
Bullshit!
I'm just Katia van Dess.

399
00:43:33,638 --> 00:43:36,078
You speak French, Spanish, Mandarín.
Where did you learn them?

400
00:43:36,178 --> 00:43:37,907
HOw did you free yourself from the rope?

401
00:43:39,923 --> 00:43:41,653
You've been programmed.

402
00:43:42,356 --> 00:43:45,708
And your name isn't Katia van Dees.
It's "quatre-vingt-dix".

403
00:43:46,008 --> 00:43:47,474
French for "90".

404
00:43:49,072 --> 00:43:51,184
So I'm 43 versions better than you?

405
00:43:53,019 --> 00:43:54,021
So they know?

406
00:43:54,022 --> 00:43:56,058
If they knew,
you'd be the target.

407
00:43:56,159 --> 00:43:57,212
Come on, let's go.

408
00:44:04,575 --> 00:44:08,508
If you need my help to find
my father, Why did you shoot me?

409
00:44:09,368 --> 00:44:11,996
I didn't shoot you, I marked you.

410
00:44:16,806 --> 00:44:17,984
There is so many.

411
00:44:17,986 --> 00:44:21,087
If I shoot one, the rest will converge.
So what do we do, Katia?

412
00:44:22,207 --> 00:44:23,207
Avoid them.

413
00:44:24,827 --> 00:44:27,288
NO, suppress your fear.
And face the threat.

414
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:33,648
YOur father programmed you to see and hear
everything at extremely hightend levels.

415
00:44:37,458 --> 00:44:40,491
You process that information
to anticipate a threat.

416
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:48,531
So anticipate it.

417
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:04,810
Katia.

418
00:45:10,296 --> 00:45:11,297
There.

419
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:43,739
<i>Area Four, all...</i>

420
00:45:54,142 --> 00:45:55,144
Katia.

421
00:45:57,523 --> 00:45:58,523
Now.

422
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:07,182
I need you to step out there.

423
00:46:07,183 --> 00:46:08,185
Why?

424
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,467
To draw them toward you.

425
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,291
They're going to shoot me!

426
00:46:13,385 --> 00:46:14,878
They're not going to shoot you.

427
00:46:18,071 --> 00:46:19,878
You want to see your father again?

428
00:46:22,977 --> 00:46:23,977
Trust me.

429
00:46:32,803 --> 00:46:34,117
<i>I ahve a visual target lock.</i>

430
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,919
<i>Moving in.</i>

431
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:44,742
Hello, Katia.

432
00:46:51,343 --> 00:46:54,613
I'm only going to ask you once.
Where is your father?

433
00:46:59,389 --> 00:47:02,255
I want you to know, I'm a
big fan of your work, 47.

434
00:47:02,256 --> 00:47:03,930
It's an honor to meet a legend.

435
00:47:06,078 --> 00:47:08,790
I thought you could only
be a legend after you are dead.

436
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,279
Oh, but you are.

437
00:47:11,009 --> 00:47:12,730
You just don't know it yet.

438
00:47:14,924 --> 00:47:17,338
Feeling pretty good for
a dead man, John.

439
00:47:17,539 --> 00:47:19,785
- Almost as good as you.
- Yeah?

440
00:47:21,181 --> 00:47:23,041
Well, the thing is I'm special.

441
00:47:23,572 --> 00:47:24,574
Let's see.

442
00:47:45,273 --> 00:47:46,311
Pretty crazy, huh?

443
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:10,092
I'm better. Say it!

444
00:48:12,032 --> 00:48:13,132
Say it!

445
00:48:14,967 --> 00:48:16,114
You're not.

446
00:48:19,965 --> 00:48:21,089
You missed.

447
00:48:21,090 --> 00:48:22,387
No she didn't.

448
00:48:47,528 --> 00:48:48,583
<i>You made a mistake.</i>

449
00:48:48,584 --> 00:48:50,111
<i>He had a gun to your head.</i>

450
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:53,031
And he didn't pull the trigger.
He wanted me to know he beat me.

451
00:48:53,512 --> 00:48:54,731
Well, what the fuck is he?

452
00:48:54,833 --> 00:48:58,187
People just don't walk away from
four bullets. They just don't.

453
00:48:58,527 --> 00:49:00,865
Subdermal titanium body armour.

454
00:49:01,863 --> 00:49:04,003
Injected under the skin
in liquid form

455
00:49:04,004 --> 00:49:05,903
It's flexible, extremely strong

456
00:49:06,304 --> 00:49:09,834
He had his nervous system heightened.
Wired for speed.

457
00:49:10,861 --> 00:49:13,009
I've heard of these Syndicate experiments..

458
00:49:14,466 --> 00:49:16,324
If they can do this with him...

459
00:49:20,586 --> 00:49:23,679
Now, will you tell me
where Litvenko is?

460
00:49:24,081 --> 00:49:26,508
Swear to me that you're not
going to hurt him.

461
00:49:27,567 --> 00:49:28,567
<i>Swear it.</i>

462
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,873
<i>Alright, I swear it.</i>

463
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:33,509
<i>Diana, did you hear that?</i>

464
00:49:33,708 --> 00:49:36,142
I did. Send me the link to the asset.

465
00:49:37,799 --> 00:49:39,892
If you lie to me, I will kill you.

466
00:49:41,187 --> 00:49:42,870
I'm not that easy to kill.

467
00:49:48,105 --> 00:49:49,266
He's in Singapore.

468
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:53,888
Syndicate headquarters are
in Singapore.

469
00:49:54,959 --> 00:49:56,636
<i>He's hiding in plain sight.</i>

470
00:50:23,210 --> 00:50:25,089
<i>- Yes?
- It's Diana.</i>

471
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:27,142
<i>I need you in Singapore
as soon as possible.</i>

472
00:50:27,244 --> 00:50:28,653
I'm on my way.

473
00:51:00,466 --> 00:51:02,040
<b>Singapore</b>

474
00:51:12,125 --> 00:51:13,124
Yes?

475
00:51:13,125 --> 00:51:15,308
Litvenko's in Singapore.
They're on their way.

476
00:51:17,707 --> 00:51:20,804
Thy're coming. Scan the
re-entry points.

477
00:51:21,106 --> 00:51:22,306
Yes, sir.

478
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:43,737
The Syndicate ties into those
cameras, isn't it?

479
00:51:43,838 --> 00:51:45,497
They're tied to everything.

480
00:51:46,832 --> 00:51:49,094
Will you hold this, please?
Thanks.

481
00:51:49,656 --> 00:51:51,364
How do you fight against that?

482
00:51:51,619 --> 00:51:53,862
By playing the odds,
doing the unexpected.

483
00:51:53,894 --> 00:51:56,995
Take nothing for granted.
Everything you do has a reason.

484
00:51:57,690 --> 00:51:58,913
What does that mean?

485
00:51:59,966 --> 00:52:02,064
Jacket. Give me your bag.

486
00:52:02,465 --> 00:52:05,848
Right now,
it means avoid those cameras.

487
00:52:06,405 --> 00:52:07,405
Okay.

488
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,421
<b>08/14</b>

489
00:53:41,631 --> 00:53:43,481
I know, that took me too long.

490
00:53:48,762 --> 00:53:49,987
Ask you a question?

491
00:53:50,695 --> 00:53:52,638
Am I going to end up like you?

492
00:54:26,093 --> 00:54:27,094
Bombs?

493
00:54:28,369 --> 00:54:29,370
Moths.

494
00:54:30,483 --> 00:54:32,200
Italian wool, they love it.

495
00:54:47,689 --> 00:54:51,165
<b>TARGET LOCATED</b>

496
00:55:15,024 --> 00:55:16,024
Did it hurt?

497
00:55:19,048 --> 00:55:20,048
Yes.

498
00:55:21,724 --> 00:55:22,724
You all...?

499
00:55:23,124 --> 00:55:25,332
The barcode is given to
us when we are born.

500
00:55:28,164 --> 00:55:29,165
The number?

501
00:55:29,166 --> 00:55:30,653
When we become Agents.

502
00:55:46,541 --> 00:55:48,549
He'll be there in the morning,
at about 9:00.

503
00:55:49,151 --> 00:55:51,195
It's when the orchids
are in full bloom.

504
00:55:57,651 --> 00:55:58,937
You know he's dying?

505
00:56:02,565 --> 00:56:03,848
Lung cancer.

506
00:56:05,549 --> 00:56:07,784
He needs an inhaler
now to breathe.

507
00:56:24,179 --> 00:56:25,691
Are you human?

508
00:56:29,092 --> 00:56:33,089
Is just that John said you're incapable
of feeling fear or remorse

509
00:56:33,124 --> 00:56:35,355
It's all been suppressed.
Is that true?

510
00:56:37,056 --> 00:56:38,055
Yes.

511
00:56:38,056 --> 00:56:39,147
What about love?

512
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:44,458
I am what I need to be.

513
00:56:44,459 --> 00:56:45,529
What does that mean?

514
00:56:45,829 --> 00:56:49,159
In this job, sometimes
it's better not to feel anything

515
00:56:49,261 --> 00:56:51,336
I'm not talking about the job

516
00:56:53,844 --> 00:56:55,025
I think you're lying

517
00:56:57,189 --> 00:56:59,988
I don't believe you can just
turn off fear or love

518
00:56:59,989 --> 00:57:01,369
I don't believe anyone can.

519
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:04,878
You're either a person or something
else. Which is it?

520
00:57:05,353 --> 00:57:07,732
Are you asking me, or yourself?

521
00:57:11,162 --> 00:57:13,364
You can't fight who you are, Katia.

522
00:57:14,753 --> 00:57:15,873
You'll lose.

523
00:57:16,773 --> 00:57:19,634
Is that what happened to you?
You fought who you are, and you lost?

524
00:57:24,568 --> 00:57:25,943
People can change.

525
00:57:26,738 --> 00:57:28,080
Don't put your faith in me.

526
00:57:30,119 --> 00:57:31,841
You'll be disappointed.

527
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,300
I still have a job to do.

528
00:57:38,462 --> 00:57:39,463
Which is?

529
00:57:40,956 --> 00:57:43,317
Right now, I need to sleep.

530
00:59:30,613 --> 00:59:33,976
When I get anxious, and I can't sleep,
I take things apart.

531
00:59:37,043 --> 00:59:38,043
I'm sorry.

532
00:59:40,213 --> 00:59:41,585
Don't ever do that again.

533
00:59:46,652 --> 00:59:47,761
Were they Syndicate?

534
00:59:47,865 --> 00:59:49,014
No, free-lance.

535
00:59:49,116 --> 00:59:50,296
Friends of yours?

536
00:59:52,153 --> 00:59:54,387
So, the Syndicate doesn't
know we're here?

537
00:59:54,422 --> 00:59:56,622
There's a open contract out on
us. What do you think?

538
00:59:57,893 --> 01:00:00,979
Here, try not to take this apart.

539
01:00:06,229 --> 01:00:08,567
<i>- Smells bad.
- Robert, please!</i>

540
01:00:08,602 --> 01:00:11,326
- How did they find us so quick?
- You tell me.

541
01:00:11,526 --> 01:00:14,450
- No games.
- What makes you think this is a game?

542
01:00:18,369 --> 01:00:20,806
The cameras in the Terminal
didn't see me.

543
01:00:26,465 --> 01:00:29,171
But the one outside, near the
exit, did.

544
01:00:30,906 --> 01:00:32,558
Getting pretty good at this,
aren't I?

545
01:00:32,759 --> 01:00:34,459
No, you're sloppy.

546
01:00:34,461 --> 01:00:36,059
<i>But, I'm going to have an attack.</i>

547
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:38,882
Bee a good boy.
Here, take your inhalor.

548
01:00:38,917 --> 01:00:39,983
It'll be alrght.

549
01:00:47,832 --> 01:00:48,833
Excuse me.

550
01:00:53,129 --> 01:00:54,890
- Where did you get that?
- I traded it.

551
01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:56,715
- For what?
- Your knife.

552
01:01:16,767 --> 01:01:18,918
Bring Litvenko
and the girl to me.

553
01:02:26,272 --> 01:02:27,563
You shouldn't have come.

554
01:02:29,685 --> 01:02:31,086
You know who I am?

555
01:02:39,141 --> 01:02:41,464
You are your mother's daughter.

556
01:02:44,817 --> 01:02:46,437
Why did you leave me?

557
01:02:50,615 --> 01:02:53,041
I wanted you to have
no part of what I was.

558
01:02:53,541 --> 01:02:55,647
I wanted you to live.

559
01:02:58,401 --> 01:02:59,863
You had no right.

560
01:03:00,571 --> 01:03:02,365
To walk away from you?

561
01:03:04,919 --> 01:03:08,662
To turn me into this isolated,
afraid thing that I am.

562
01:03:08,697 --> 01:03:09,964
You had no right!

563
01:03:16,761 --> 01:03:18,164
Walk with me, Katia.

564
01:03:25,866 --> 01:03:27,963
I loved your mother very much.

565
01:03:28,663 --> 01:03:30,677
She was a light...

566
01:03:30,877 --> 01:03:32,880
In a very dark world.

567
01:03:34,526 --> 01:03:36,882
And more than anything else..

568
01:03:37,181 --> 01:03:38,720
She wanted a child.

569
01:03:39,123 --> 01:03:41,421
But she was unable.

570
01:03:42,408 --> 01:03:45,936
So, we broke every rule we had...

571
01:03:46,361 --> 01:03:47,764
and we made you.

572
01:03:53,109 --> 01:03:55,709
We knew that if you were discovered...

573
01:03:56,011 --> 01:03:59,837
They would take you from us,
so we gave you...

574
01:03:59,938 --> 01:04:02,305
the tools to be free.

575
01:04:04,963 --> 01:04:06,407
This isn't freedom.

576
01:04:07,075 --> 01:04:09,039
No, perhaps not, Katia.

577
01:04:09,657 --> 01:04:12,302
But it is necessary
for your survival.

578
01:04:12,937 --> 01:04:16,863
NOw, I don't expect you to understand...

579
01:04:19,285 --> 01:04:22,635
But I do ask that you
find it in yourself...

580
01:04:23,071 --> 01:04:25,621
to forgive an old man's selfishness.

581
01:04:26,491 --> 01:04:27,744
And if I can't?

582
01:04:28,834 --> 01:04:33,976
You will, because you are the
reflection of the woman I loved.

583
01:04:43,014 --> 01:04:44,132
I'm ready.

584
01:04:44,926 --> 01:04:46,022
Get it over with.

585
01:04:48,606 --> 01:04:49,732
Do it now.

586
01:04:51,066 --> 01:04:52,923
He's not going to kill you...

587
01:04:54,106 --> 01:04:55,388
father.

588
01:04:57,282 --> 01:04:59,382
Yes he will.
It's inevitable.

589
01:04:59,582 --> 01:05:03,135
Killing is what he is programmed to do,
and who he is.

590
01:05:03,451 --> 01:05:05,707
Isn't that right, 47?

591
01:05:07,004 --> 01:05:08,004
You're wrong.

592
01:05:09,746 --> 01:05:12,912
We determine who we are
by what we do.

593
01:05:19,636 --> 01:05:20,829
You believe...?

594
01:05:21,775 --> 01:05:23,786
You have a choice?

595
01:05:24,926 --> 01:05:27,588
I believe that's
what makes us human.

596
01:05:29,454 --> 01:05:31,081
Then it seems...

597
01:05:31,901 --> 01:05:33,777
that you and your brother...

598
01:05:33,978 --> 01:05:36,801
have a lot to teach
this old man.

599
01:05:39,657 --> 01:05:42,785
I guess I gave you
family, after all.

600
01:05:46,806 --> 01:05:47,807
Move!

601
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:26,285
I got you.

602
01:06:30,794 --> 01:06:31,794
Seal the building.

603
01:06:37,457 --> 01:06:38,457
Go!

604
01:06:42,251 --> 01:06:44,291
- What do they want?
- More of me.

605
01:06:44,326 --> 01:06:46,331
Why would anyone
want more of you?

606
01:06:54,709 --> 01:06:57,225
One and Two stay on him,
Three and Four cut him off.

607
01:07:24,808 --> 01:07:25,808
<i>Cut him off.</i>

608
01:08:02,823 --> 01:08:04,683
<i>They're boxed in,
they've got nowhere else to go.</i>

609
01:08:04,684 --> 01:08:06,087
Right or left, Katia?

610
01:08:10,471 --> 01:08:11,713
Straight ahead.

611
01:08:13,187 --> 01:08:14,651
Trust me.

612
01:08:24,746 --> 01:08:25,816
Holy shit!

613
01:08:31,401 --> 01:08:32,990
I want this building sealed!

614
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:36,120
Perhaps you should consider shooting him.

615
01:08:36,907 --> 01:08:38,191
Subdermal body armour.

616
01:08:38,193 --> 01:08:40,439
What, they actually got that to work?

617
01:08:40,474 --> 01:08:41,541
Yup.

618
01:08:43,291 --> 01:08:45,048
Drive the fucken car faster.

619
01:08:47,056 --> 01:08:48,386
Faster! faster!

620
01:08:48,421 --> 01:08:49,716
We won't be able to make it.

621
01:08:50,039 --> 01:08:51,044
Trust me.

622
01:09:13,958 --> 01:09:16,825
I want all units on station.
We'll take them in the city.

623
01:09:28,995 --> 01:09:31,585
- This is never going to end, is it?
- I'm afraid not.

624
01:09:32,032 --> 01:09:33,308
He will never stop.

625
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:34,276
Who?

626
01:09:34,311 --> 01:09:38,020
Antoine Le Clerq.
He's the Syndicate chairman.

627
01:09:39,766 --> 01:09:42,294
What if we kill this Le Clerq?
Will it end then?

628
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:43,490
We can't.

629
01:09:43,591 --> 01:09:45,059
Maybe not, but you can.

630
01:09:45,161 --> 01:09:49,703
Nobody ever gets close enough
to LeClerk to kill him.

631
01:09:50,575 --> 01:09:53,873
He nver leaves his protected offce.
Nobody ever goes in.

632
01:09:53,908 --> 01:09:55,940
He's surrounded at all times
by security.

633
01:09:56,683 --> 01:09:57,683
Fourteen.

634
01:09:59,090 --> 01:10:01,032
That's how many Agents
have tried.

635
01:10:01,325 --> 01:10:02,398
All are dead.

636
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,824
Help me! Help me!

637
01:11:41,925 --> 01:11:43,731
- Get up!
- I can't walk!

638
01:11:43,732 --> 01:11:45,734
Come on! You can do it!

639
01:11:45,736 --> 01:11:47,533
Get up.

640
01:11:47,568 --> 01:11:49,138
- Sorry.
- I'll get help.

641
01:11:49,407 --> 01:11:50,403
Take her away from me!

642
01:11:50,404 --> 01:11:54,007
- Take her! Come on!
- Take here! Please!

643
01:11:54,008 --> 01:11:55,008
<i>Come on!</i>

644
01:11:56,883 --> 01:11:59,353
<i>Please! Get her out of here!</i>

645
01:11:59,354 --> 01:12:00,890
<i>No! No!</i>

646
01:12:00,891 --> 01:12:01,891
<i>Take her!</i>

647
01:12:30,647 --> 01:12:32,209
Hello, doctor.

648
01:12:41,117 --> 01:12:44,573
What the hell did you do?
We have to go back!

649
01:12:45,605 --> 01:12:46,931
He was all I had.

650
01:12:46,932 --> 01:12:49,248
- I have to help him.
- You can't.

651
01:12:49,283 --> 01:12:51,601
Damn you, you piece of shit!

652
01:12:52,549 --> 01:12:55,472
- I should kill you.
- Yes, but you won't, because you're weak.

653
01:12:55,707 --> 01:13:00,526
You're nothing more than a scared little
girl, who's only real gift is running.

654
01:13:00,670 --> 01:13:01,670
Damn you.

655
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:27,261
DNA sequences, Doctor?

656
01:13:29,959 --> 01:13:32,259
Adaptive mutated bacteria fissures

657
01:13:32,665 --> 01:13:35,954
The epistasis rings?
Transfer RNA?

658
01:13:40,995 --> 01:13:42,967
Come on, Doc.

659
01:13:48,718 --> 01:13:50,137
<i>I don't want to do this.</i>

660
01:13:51,159 --> 01:13:53,514
<i>Believe me, you don't want
me to do this either.</i>

661
01:13:54,770 --> 01:13:56,947
<i>So tell me what I need to know.</i>

662
01:13:57,359 --> 01:13:58,485
<i>Tell me...</i>

663
01:13:58,585 --> 01:14:02,393
how to make an Agent.

664
01:14:10,382 --> 01:14:12,330
This is just experimental, Doc.

665
01:14:13,352 --> 01:14:15,059
I've seen it work...

666
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:18,545
And believe me when I tell
you don't want to be the one.

667
01:14:20,436 --> 01:14:22,097
You're a bastard.

668
01:14:22,797 --> 01:14:23,797
I know.

669
01:14:23,898 --> 01:14:25,776
No. you don't.

670
01:14:26,741 --> 01:14:29,925
You're a result of
inferior techonologies.

671
01:14:30,563 --> 01:14:31,906
A failed experiment.

672
01:14:32,978 --> 01:14:36,373
An Agent's advantage is not
his body, John Smith.

673
01:14:36,474 --> 01:14:37,734
It's his mind.

674
01:14:38,833 --> 01:14:42,273
You will never be as good as him.

675
01:14:45,129 --> 01:14:46,142
Inject him.

676
01:15:13,345 --> 01:15:17,047
For fuck's sake Doctor,
give me what I need.

677
01:15:37,570 --> 01:15:38,572
Shit.

678
01:15:44,028 --> 01:15:45,170
Mr. Chairman.

679
01:15:45,473 --> 01:15:46,473
Are you alright?

680
01:15:46,845 --> 01:15:48,370
No, I am not.

681
01:15:48,371 --> 01:15:49,863
I need the Chairman's detail.

682
01:15:49,864 --> 01:15:51,635
<i>The Chairman is out.</i>

683
01:15:58,902 --> 01:16:00,345
<i>911.</i>

684
01:16:00,346 --> 01:16:02,222
Emergecny Services, please.

685
01:16:02,672 --> 01:16:04,517
<i>Can I have your location, please.</i>

686
01:16:05,791 --> 01:16:06,847
Dose him again.

687
01:16:06,848 --> 01:16:08,121
You could kill him.

688
01:16:08,684 --> 01:16:09,892
Do it.

689
01:16:11,195 --> 01:16:12,403
Oh, fuck it!

690
01:16:15,399 --> 01:16:16,501
<i>It's the Chairman.</i>

691
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:20,041
What's happening?

692
01:16:21,186 --> 01:16:22,931
What's he doing out of his office?

693
01:16:29,147 --> 01:16:30,148
It's quite enough, John.

694
01:16:30,744 --> 01:16:33,241
You can wait outside,
all of you.

695
01:16:36,844 --> 01:16:38,409
It's okay, John.

696
01:16:53,409 --> 01:16:54,468
Petya.

697
01:16:56,147 --> 01:16:57,307
Can you hear me?

698
01:17:02,875 --> 01:17:06,048
I am going to be completely
honest with you.

699
01:17:08,762 --> 01:17:10,266
I admire you.

700
01:17:11,355 --> 01:17:14,728
YOu have created something unique.

701
01:17:15,908 --> 01:17:18,894
A better human being,
and I want it.

702
01:17:22,043 --> 01:17:27,106
I have bet my wealth,
my company, my reputation...

703
01:17:28,467 --> 01:17:33,348
Everyting on the success of this program.
You understand?

704
01:17:34,438 --> 01:17:38,072
Good thing I sold your stock, then.

705
01:17:39,972 --> 01:17:43,861
You and I are so very different.
You know this.

706
01:17:44,296 --> 01:17:45,877
You're wrong.

707
01:17:47,017 --> 01:17:49,242
People can change.

708
01:17:50,433 --> 01:17:51,433
No.

709
01:17:53,263 --> 01:17:54,836
No, not people like us.

710
01:17:56,468 --> 01:17:58,001
What you did...

711
01:17:58,002 --> 01:18:00,834
When you chose to play God,
can never be undone.

712
01:18:02,620 --> 01:18:05,125
You can't run from what you are.

713
01:18:05,586 --> 01:18:07,244
So I should...?

714
01:18:07,545 --> 01:18:09,401
Embrace it?

715
01:18:09,784 --> 01:18:14,078
Re-start the Program
with you as it's head?

716
01:18:14,763 --> 01:18:15,811
Yes.

717
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:25,397
You always were a small man, Antoine.

718
01:18:27,479 --> 01:18:31,089
A derivitive thinker, at best.

719
01:18:32,936 --> 01:18:37,791
This desperation suits you.

720
01:18:49,437 --> 01:18:51,201
The key to everything...

721
01:18:53,151 --> 01:18:56,899
is in your mind,
and you're going to give it to me.

722
01:18:58,461 --> 01:19:01,302
Tell me how to build an Agent.

723
01:19:02,953 --> 01:19:05,195
You don't want an Agent.

724
01:19:07,128 --> 01:19:08,561
Then, What do I want?

725
01:19:08,562 --> 01:19:09,889
An Army.

726
01:19:10,642 --> 01:19:13,545
And I won't give it to you.

727
01:19:15,836 --> 01:19:17,417
Then you're going to die.

728
01:19:17,944 --> 01:19:19,835
I'm already dead.

729
01:19:23,369 --> 01:19:26,068
Yes, what about your daughter?

730
01:19:27,188 --> 01:19:29,186
You don't have her.

731
01:19:29,617 --> 01:19:31,038
No, but I will...

732
01:19:31,495 --> 01:19:33,110
eventually.

733
01:19:33,632 --> 01:19:38,178
Give me what I want
and I'll leave her in peace.

734
01:19:38,465 --> 01:19:43,209
I give you what you want
there won't be no peace.

735
01:19:43,476 --> 01:19:45,071
<i>Mr. Chairman.</i>

736
01:19:48,743 --> 01:19:50,058
Where is he?

737
01:19:50,411 --> 01:19:51,781
How did he get into our system?

738
01:19:51,782 --> 01:19:52,982
<i>I don't know, Mr. Chairman.</i>

739
01:19:52,983 --> 01:19:56,392
I'm assuming by your reaction,
that you know who I am

740
01:19:56,712 --> 01:19:57,776
What do you want?

741
01:19:58,177 --> 01:19:59,177
<i>To make a deal.</i>

742
01:19:59,378 --> 01:20:01,778
- You have nothing I need.
- You're wrong.

743
01:20:02,501 --> 01:20:05,193
You want what's inside
Litvenko's head...

744
01:20:05,194 --> 01:20:07,153
<i>But he won't give it to you.</i>

745
01:20:08,149 --> 01:20:09,349
<i>I can.</i>

746
01:20:09,549 --> 01:20:10,549
How?

747
01:20:11,303 --> 01:20:12,792
<i>Window.</i>

748
01:20:18,818 --> 01:20:20,999
<i>You want the next
generation of Agents...</i>

749
01:20:21,261 --> 01:20:24,095
<i>but you've been
looking in the wrong place.</i>

750
01:20:24,286 --> 01:20:28,031
<i>You thought the girl was
the only way to find Litvenko.</i>

751
01:20:28,353 --> 01:20:30,635
<i>A means to an end.</i>

752
01:20:31,738 --> 01:20:33,035
The truth is...

753
01:20:35,564 --> 01:20:37,582
<i>She is the end.</i>

754
01:20:41,463 --> 01:20:44,524
<i>That's right, everything you need.</i>

755
01:20:45,076 --> 01:20:46,928
<i>The strength, the speed...</i>

756
01:20:46,929 --> 01:20:49,165
<i>the intelligence, is right there.</i>

757
01:20:49,822 --> 01:20:52,173
<i>Locked inside her DNA.</i>

758
01:20:54,044 --> 01:20:57,785
So you want to trade him for her?
Why?

759
01:20:58,041 --> 01:21:01,396
Because I always
close my contracts.

760
01:21:01,612 --> 01:21:02,612
<i>Fuck you.</i>

761
01:21:04,779 --> 01:21:06,776
There's a helipad on the roof.

762
01:21:07,265 --> 01:21:09,151
Get him someplace secure.

763
01:22:15,506 --> 01:22:18,287
- Heading up to the Safe Room.
- I want all teams to Floor 40.

764
01:22:18,288 --> 01:22:19,728
<i>That's not going to be enough, John.</i>

765
01:22:32,977 --> 01:22:35,497
No. You stay with me,
protect me!

766
01:22:35,681 --> 01:22:37,352
<i>So many choices.</i>

767
01:22:37,752 --> 01:22:39,532
<i>And only one right answer.</i>

768
01:22:40,088 --> 01:22:41,749
What's it gonna be?

769
01:22:41,851 --> 01:22:44,469
<i>Emotion or duty?</i>

770
01:23:26,853 --> 01:23:28,682
It was too quick.
Fire Dept was here too quick.

771
01:23:28,683 --> 01:23:30,927
- Someone called them before the crash.
- What does that mean?

772
01:23:31,029 --> 01:23:33,250
It means he was never
in that helicopter.

773
01:23:40,587 --> 01:23:41,787
Get them out.

774
01:24:49,698 --> 01:24:51,179
What was your mistake?

775
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,090
I don't make mistakes.

776
01:24:53,782 --> 01:24:58,465
You needed me to know
that you were better than me.

777
01:25:19,349 --> 01:25:20,512
Where is he?

778
01:25:23,946 --> 01:25:25,145
On the roof.

779
01:25:31,086 --> 01:25:33,709
When this is done, I will kill you.

780
01:27:59,779 --> 01:28:02,133
Your mother would be proud of you.

781
01:28:02,615 --> 01:28:03,616
What?

782
01:28:05,927 --> 01:28:06,927
Nothing.

783
01:28:07,428 --> 01:28:09,713
I doubt you'd understand.

784
01:28:10,617 --> 01:28:11,676
Doesn't matter.

785
01:28:11,876 --> 01:28:13,567
We'll find her.

786
01:28:13,767 --> 01:28:15,544
I believe you will.

787
01:29:03,584 --> 01:29:05,713
<i>Confirm target termination.</i>

788
01:29:05,801 --> 01:29:06,893
Target...

789
01:29:07,195 --> 01:29:09,745
Le Clerq, Antoine...

790
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:11,730
terminated.

791
01:29:11,945 --> 01:29:13,424
And the other?

792
01:29:14,989 --> 01:29:16,775
<i>Second target?</i>

793
01:29:20,664 --> 01:29:21,665
<i>47?</i>

794
01:29:22,366 --> 01:29:23,637
<i>47!</i>

795
01:29:24,803 --> 01:29:26,694
<i>Second target?.</i>

796
01:29:31,110 --> 01:29:32,529
Le Clerq.

797
01:29:32,979 --> 01:29:35,309
He was your target the whole time?

798
01:29:36,505 --> 01:29:40,157
Everything that you told me,
was you'd have a diversion?

799
01:29:40,579 --> 01:29:41,776
It was necessary.

800
01:29:41,777 --> 01:29:43,711
What? to kill a single man?

801
01:29:44,017 --> 01:29:45,017
No.

802
01:29:45,995 --> 01:29:49,679
To put a stop to the Agent Program,
once and for all.

803
01:29:51,513 --> 01:29:53,139
And to set you free.

804
01:29:55,539 --> 01:29:57,325
Your father loved you, Katia.

805
01:29:58,142 --> 01:30:02,579
He understood that LeClerk would not
rest once he knew who you were.

806
01:30:03,755 --> 01:30:05,637
That he would hunt you down.

807
01:30:07,137 --> 01:30:10,023
So he did what any parent would.

808
01:30:11,115 --> 01:30:12,918
He died to save his children.

809
01:30:21,197 --> 01:30:23,157
This is your mission, isn't it?

810
01:30:29,145 --> 01:30:31,742
We determine who we are,
by what we do.

811
01:30:40,184 --> 01:30:43,157
There is a building full of
highly-trained operatives...

812
01:30:43,158 --> 01:30:45,591
who will be on their way up here now.

813
01:30:46,334 --> 01:30:47,533
You're wrong..

814
