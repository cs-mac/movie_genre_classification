1
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:12,270
No, you’ve already had some.
Go away!

2
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:28,856
<i>After the Wedding</i>

3
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:36,730
Are there only rich people
where you are going?

4
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:43,999
If I was rich, I’d be happy.

5
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:49,447
You hate all the rich, Mr Jacob.

6
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:52,517
Is it because the houses are
far apart that people are far apart?

7
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:21,510
You’re not coming back.
I know it.

8
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:17,394
Why do you have to go?

9
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,742
Do you promise to come
to my birthday?

10
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:39,615
Okay?

11
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,931
“In the yard, a flock of sparrows

12
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,566
saw him and began to shout:”

13
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:07,407
“Tit tit! Tit tit!
Oh, look at Nils Goosey-boy.”

14
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:12,317
“Look at Thumbietot!
Look at Nils Holgersen Thumbietot!”

15
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:17,548
“Cock-a-doodle-do,
cried the cock.”

16
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:19,854
“Cock-a-doodle-do!”

17
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:25,330
“Then the hens came.
Peck, peck, peck …”

18
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:32,601
We’ll stop here for tonight.
You have to sleep.

19
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:37,332
Into bed with you.

20
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,476
Sleep tight.

21
00:09:49,655 --> 00:09:51,145
Good night.

22
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:56,760
Good night, Morten.
Good night, Martin.

23
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:18,279
It’ll be fun to see
what important thing I forgot.

24
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,386
Yes, it will be lovely.

25
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:25,520
As long as there’s food and wine ….

26
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:31,393
—You’re not nervous at all?
—No, I’m looking at it as a test.

27
00:10:32,231 --> 00:10:36,167
—Of what?
—Anna will marry many times.

28
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:41,500
The first wedding is always hard.

29
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,531
With a little luck, it will be okay.

30
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:52,674
<i>Jørgen … Jørgen?</i>

31
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,683
Yes?

32
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,383
Mother, aren’t you in bed?

33
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,892
I can’t get online.

34
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:03,690
Don’t speak to me like I’m senile.

35
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:08,291
Why can’t I get online?
There’s poker in three minutes.

36
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,997
Why did we have to get
that damn wireless network?

37
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:17,067
But it’s working now … Thank you.

38
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:20,442
—Sleep tight.
—Don’t stay up all night.

39
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:27,883
Sorry.

40
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,820
Could we teach her to knock first?

41
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,916
I’ve tried, but she’s senile.

42
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,018
Only when she wants to be.

43
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:42,223
—I’ll send her to a home tomorrow.
—Promise?

44
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,292
That’s me.

45
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:46,526
—May I take your bag?
—No, thanks.

46
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:51,162
Please step inside.
Main switch.

47
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:56,498
The bedroom. B&O television.

48
00:12:56,542 --> 00:13:01,172
The first of the suite’s two bathrooms.
There are also three toilets.

49
00:13:01,213 --> 00:13:03,113
Mini-bar. Safe.

50
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:07,279
Larger bottles here. If there’s anything
else you’d like just say so.

51
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:10,345
Flat screen. Air-conditioning.
B&O stereo in the corner.

52
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:14,689
Sauna. Adjustable temperature.
Timer. On/off button.

53
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:18,163
The same goes for the Jacuzzi.
On and off.

54
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:21,758
Private rooftop terrace.
The old university.

55
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:25,498
The Cathedral where the Crown Prince
got married. The Round Tower.

56
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:32,670
If you need anything else,
press three.

57
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:25,124
Excuse me.
Excuse me, sir.

58
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:28,525
—Jacob Pedersen?
—That’s me.

59
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:31,035
Christian Refner,
I’m here to pick you up.

60
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:35,200
Do you have a coat?
No? Then let’s go.

61
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,807
—The room’s okay?
—It’s fine.

62
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,146
It used to be a department store.
Funny isn’t it?

63
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:52,586
—So, Jacob with a “C” or a “K”?
—It’s with a “C”.

64
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,389
I’m Christian with a “C” too.

65
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:06,498
—So you’re meeting Jørgen?
—Yes.

66
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:09,371
—Do you know him well?
—He’s my father-in-law.

67
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,707
—Or will be on Saturday.
—Congratulations.

68
00:15:14,146 --> 00:15:16,637
Jørgen’s fantastic.

69
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:19,082
He’s brilliant, really brilliant.

70
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,523
—People often fear him, but don’t.
—Good.

71
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:31,588
He’s worth over a billion
and started out flat broke,

72
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,621
but you can’t tell.

73
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,657
That he started flat broke?

74
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,064
No, no ….

75
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:58,247
—Jacob Pedersen is here.
—Have a seat. Just for a moment.

76
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:02,555
—It was nice to meet you, Jacob.
—Same here. Good luck.

77
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:03,891
Give my regards to Jørgen.

78
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:05,920
—Hi.
—Hi.

79
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,456
—Busy?
—A little.

80
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:12,770
—That looks nice on you.
—Thanks.

81
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:17,499
—Have a nice day, okay? Bye.
—Bye.

82
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:21,140
Jacob.

83
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:26,077
Welcome.
My name is Jørgen Hansson.

84
00:16:26,118 --> 00:16:27,676
—Jacob.
—This way.

85
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,657
Was the flight okay?
Good.

86
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,682
This is where we live.

87
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:47,862
You can see Sweden on a clear day.

88
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:50,841
If you feel like it, that is.
A drink?

89
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:52,207
No, thanks.

90
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:58,539
Cheers.

91
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:00,711
Cheers.

92
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:06,987
You have a video
that can give me a sense

93
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,823
of what goes on there.

94
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:12,092
It will take more than
a video to show you that.

95
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:14,122
Meaning?

96
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:18,227
Bombay has over
a million child prostitutes.

97
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:21,171
Four or five times that
suffer from malnutrition.

98
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,673
They’re not on the video.

99
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:28,010
Then there are those who die
every day of … Well, what ….

100
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:33,610
Minor illnesses, minor infections ….
Completely minor things—

101
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:38,453
that could be cured for tiny sums
if one only had the will.

102
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,755
We’ve developed a sort
of priority list ….

103
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:46,458
You’re an angry man. That’s good.
It gives you a lot of drive.

104
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:54,596
The educational supplies we need
include books, tables, chairs, beds …

105
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,943
but what we need most
urgently is medicine.

106
00:18:00,979 --> 00:18:05,313
Eventually we’d like to ….

107
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,875
Yes ….

108
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,651
We’d like to take twice
as many off the streets.

109
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,750
—Would you like one?
—No, thanks.

110
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:18,251
We’d like to take in twice as many
and vaccinate them—

111
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:23,166
which could be done all for less
than five kroner a day.

112
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:26,638
And we’d like to change
our food program ….

113
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:31,234
—Do they all sleep in the same room?
—We have 45 at the moment.

114
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:38,079
We go to an area, and in two minutes,
40–50 kids gather, who we then feed.

115
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,712
But after five minutes,
there are 500 kids.

116
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:46,315
—I don’t need to see more.
—The new kids ….

117
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:50,658
It’s an extremely impressive project
you have established.

118
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,392
Very impressive.

119
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:59,632
I’ve looked at different ways
I might be able to help.

120
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:04,870
Thank you very much.
In all, I found five different projects.

121
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:09,313
Yours is one of the most interesting.

122
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:14,285
Thank you. We’re glad to hear it.
But may I ask you why?

123
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,516
Like I said ….
It’s a good project.

124
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:25,186
I was thinking of an annual donation
of one million dollars for four years.

125
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:30,930
But I need more time
to think through

126
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:34,530
which projects I want
to get involved with.

127
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:38,168
So don’t get your hopes up
too high.

128
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:43,041
Okay … I was given
a different impression.

129
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:46,107
Then let’s look at the papers
again, because ….

130
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:51,714
No, no. Let’s forget the boring
paperwork until Monday.

131
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:57,191
We’ll have lunch and I’ll let
you know what I’ve decided.

132
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,723
—I’ve got a busy weekend coming up.
—So I’ve heard.

133
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:07,338
I spoke to the guy that drove me here.
He’s marrying your daughter?

134
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:11,604
—Yes, Christian. You’re not married?
—No.

135
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:15,272
—Got any family here?
—No, I don’t.

136
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:17,942
Then come to the wedding tomorrow.

137
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:21,942
It’s a huge wedding.
I don’t know half of the guests myself.

138
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:25,423
—It would be nice.
—I need to ….

139
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,784
You don’t have any other plans.

140
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:36,760
We’re through.

141
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:42,504
See you tomorrow?
We’re looking forward to it.

142
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:47,843
—Then I can get to know you.
—Thanks for your time.

143
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:26,783
—Hey, Dad!
—How are you?

144
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:31,816
Were you jumping on
the trampoline? Can I see?

145
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:38,927
Everything okay?

146
00:21:41,233 --> 00:21:44,361
Except that Annette
can’t cope with the stress.

147
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:48,768
Then now’s not the time
to say another guest is coming.

148
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:51,899
A business contact from India.

149
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:55,806
You better do it gently … in stages.

150
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:13,062
Have you changed your mind?

151
00:22:13,098 --> 00:22:15,293
There’s still time.

152
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:20,328
—Yes, come on …. You’ve got time.
—You’re just jealous.

153
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:24,331
Yes, of course.
You’re much too beautiful for him.

154
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:28,832
Will you love and honour her,
for better or for worse,

155
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:31,769
in good times and bad,

156
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:36,371
as husband and wife
till death do you part?

157
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:38,446
Yes.

158
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:41,919
And now I ask you,
Anna Louise Hansson:

159
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:45,921
do you take Christian Refner
as your lawfully wedded husband?

160
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:48,890
—Yes.
—Will you love and honour ….

161
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,903
—I’m very sorry.
—That’s okay.

162
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:20,019
Those who before us have pledged
to live as man and wife,

163
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:24,424
confirming before God
and those assembled here

164
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:28,263
their solemn vows,
I therefore pronounce you

165
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,599
man and wife.

166
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:14,001
Don’t throw them yet.
Come here. I’ll show you ….

167
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:41,970
—Hi.
—Hi, Jacob.

168
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,118
—Doing well?
—Yes.

169
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:09,596
—Hi. Welcome.
—Thank you.

170
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,109
—This is my wife.
—I see.

171
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:21,544
Have you met Anna?
You must.

172
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:28,280
—This is Jacob, who I told you about.
—Congratulations.

173
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,254
—Christian.
—Hi, Jacob.

174
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:33,052
This is Christian’s mother.

175
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:38,052
There you are.

176
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:41,656
Care for a drink?

177
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,723
Yes, please.

178
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,991
—Cheers. Welcome.
—Thanks.

179
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:07,780
—Can I play?
—Yes! Are you any good?

180
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:09,787
Good‽ I’m the best.

181
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:14,525
Aren’t you playing together?

182
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,599
I stand not just before you, Anna—

183
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:27,668
but also my boss
and father-in-law, Jørgen—

184
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:31,198
and Helene and, of course,
the rest of you.

185
00:28:33,678 --> 00:28:39,310
Anna, we met at Jørgen’s firm
when it was in the suburbs.

186
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:44,213
I didn’t dare speak to you because
you were the boss’s daughter.

187
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:48,315
Then one day you needed
to borrow 1,000 kroner.

188
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:54,120
Jørgen wasn’t there
and so I had to lend it to you.

189
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:00,094
You’d think he was marrying Jørgen.

190
00:29:00,138 --> 00:29:04,575
But Jørgen and Helene,
I would like …

191
00:29:05,043 --> 00:29:10,276
to thank you for the way you’ve
welcomed me into the family.

192
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:14,843
I know you think it’s early
for Anna to marry

193
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:17,719
but please know
that it feels very right to me.

194
00:29:17,856 --> 00:29:22,987
Anna, I love you more than all
the world. I’m thrilled you’ll have me.

195
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:28,930
Please toast to my beautiful bride

196
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:32,232
and her fantastic family
who have welcomed me so kindly—

197
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:36,601
Jørgen, Helene, the twins ….
Cheers.

198
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:15,712
Christian’s lovely, don’t you think?

199
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,747
He’s nice.

200
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:22,285
—He’s so cute.
—Cute? Maybe.

201
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:26,686
—I dated him before Anna.
—Was he your boyfriend?

202
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,485
But Anna gets whatever she wants.

203
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:45,405
It’s not traditional for the bride
to give a speech

204
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:48,041
but everything’s gone
so well so far.

205
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:52,206
I know Mum’s waiting for something
to go horribly wrong.

206
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:55,316
I’ll do it now
so that you can relax.

207
00:30:56,788 --> 00:31:01,452
My speech isn’t for you, Christian.
I love you and you know it.

208
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:04,756
I couldn’t be happier than I am today.

209
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:09,062
And don’t worry,
I’ll pay back the 1,000 kroner.

210
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:12,903
But I’d like to thank
Mum and Dad.

211
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:16,499
Mum, I know we argue
now and then

212
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:23,445
but you are the best,
the most loving

213
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:27,147
and the most loyal person
I have ever met.

214
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:32,215
And Dad ….

215
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:35,420
When I turned 18
a few years ago,

216
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:42,966
you had to tell me that you weren’t
my real father … genetically.

217
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:48,371
You told me how Mum
had known another man

218
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:53,106
and we didn’t talk for
almost six months.

219
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:56,876
It wasn’t until I met Christian
that I began to understand

220
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:59,483
why you did what you did.

221
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:06,154
You did it to protect me, so I’d have
a mother and father like everyone else.

222
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:08,582
I’ve had a dad.

223
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:13,959
You’ve been the best father
anyone could ever wish for.

224
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:21,298
And if I could have chosen,
I would have chosen you, Dad,

225
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:24,201
whether you’re my father or not.

226
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:28,236
So I’d like to say thank you.

227
00:32:28,413 --> 00:32:31,439
Thank you for today
and for everything.

228
00:32:31,582 --> 00:32:36,884
And thanks for being the way you are
for as long as I can remember.

229
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:42,116
So I’d like to propose
a toast for Mum and Dad—

230
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,093
the loveliest couple here tonight.

231
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:50,594
—Cheers.
—Cheers.

232
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:08,709
Why are you sitting here
all by yourself?

233
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:11,514
Because I want to.

234
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:16,118
Weren’t you ever taught not to
abandon a lady with seven old-maids?

235
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,725
Listen, I’ve got a plan.

236
00:33:21,866 --> 00:33:25,529
If you wait a little
and I wait a little—

237
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,161
we could go into town
after they dance.

238
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:33,976
You and me. I know a place where
they make fruit with drinks in them.

239
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:36,910
—You could come along.
—I don’t think so.

240
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:40,509
I’d like to be alone
for a while, okay?

241
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,413
—I mean it.
—Yes.

242
00:33:44,922 --> 00:33:47,914
I won’t tell anyone if you come along.
I won’t tell Anna.

243
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:49,959
—I don’t want to talk to you.
—No.

244
00:33:51,729 --> 00:33:54,755
—Are you angry?
—Are you stupid?

245
00:33:54,899 --> 00:33:57,231
Go away!

246
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:23,710
I don’t know what
the hell to think, Helene.

247
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:28,516
—About what?
—Too much fits together too well.

248
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:31,826
But then I think,

249
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:35,392
you wouldn’t have
done that to me.

250
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,200
I’d like to talk,
but not right now.

251
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:41,738
I simply can’t believe
you’ve done this to me.

252
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,075
I haven’t done anything.
What have I done?

253
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,403
Is she my daughter?

254
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:56,149
Of course not. She is mine and Jørgen’s.
What were you thinking?

255
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:58,914
—Is she my daughter?
—I’ll call tomorrow.

256
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:02,184
—I asked you a question!
—I’ll call you tomorrow!

257
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,698
Won’t you come to bed?

258
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:26,596
—Why did you do it, Jørgen?
—Do what?

259
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:31,601
I didn’t know it was him, Helene.

260
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:39,607
It’s just too much of a coincidence.

261
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:45,043
—He shouldn’t have come.
—No.

262
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:50,782
But we can’t control
everything in the world.

263
00:40:27,892 --> 00:40:31,350
Hi, it’s 602 again.
Do I have any messages now?

264
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,992
Thanks.

265
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:53,947
—That’s nice.
—Let me have a look?

266
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:57,448
—It’s got small swastikas on it.
—They’re not swastikas.

267
00:40:57,755 --> 00:40:59,450
It’s wonderful.

268
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,117
It’s from ….

269
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:06,654
—It’s from Allan and Kristina.
—One of our really good lawyers.

270
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:09,860
He’ll be fired for giving
such an ugly vase, right?

271
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:14,695
—Put it over there.
—It goes in the basement.

272
00:41:18,509 --> 00:41:20,739
I have to talk to Helene.

273
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:25,507
Listen, I don’t like this either,
but I need to talk to her now.

274
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:28,177
—Come in.
—Thank you.

275
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:32,154
Wait here.

276
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:40,553
Helene, we have a guest.

277
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:44,566
—Wanna play football?
—Hi.

278
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:47,801
—Thanks for coming yesterday.
—My pleasure.

279
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:52,241
—Can we offer you something?
—No. Helene, can we talk?

280
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:55,211
—I was going to call.
—But you didn’t. Do you have a minute?

281
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:57,305
Of course.

282
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:03,686
Yes.

283
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:09,387
—Let’s go out to the kitchen.
—Good idea.

284
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:13,260
—Or would you rather be alone?
—No, I’d like you to come.

285
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:16,095
Boys, stay with Anna
and grandmother.

286
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:21,262
—Jørgen, is everything okay?
—Yes, unwrap your presents.

287
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:25,039
All this running to and fro.

288
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:27,674
You old grump ….

289
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:31,107
—Did you lose again?
—Yes.

290
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:39,212
Don’t come here like this. You should
have waited for me to call you.

291
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:43,416
—You didn’t call!
—Don’t come here and intimidate me!

292
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:49,791
I waited all day. Who are you?
How can you stand yourself?

293
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:54,962
Jacob, we tried to contact you several
times, but we couldn’t find you.

294
00:42:56,907 --> 00:43:00,343
Come on. You’re filthy rich.
You could have hired an army.

295
00:43:00,477 --> 00:43:03,469
It obviously took more
than an army to find you.

296
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:07,744
To find a junkie drinking
in India with hookers.

297
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:11,514
You hid my daughter for 20 years
because I cheated once?

298
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:14,948
Do you really think
that’s why, Jacob?

299
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:18,119
Because you cheated once?
You’re a very small person.

300
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:21,390
—What are you telling me?
—You’re not listening.

301
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:25,896
—Then tell me. Tell me!
—Let’s all calm down a little.

302
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:37,303
Why didn’t you tell me
you were pregnant?

303
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:42,946
—We’d have figured something out.
—I didn’t know until I got back.

304
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:48,183
I met Jørgen and ….
No, Jacob, I don’t owe you anything.

305
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:54,125
You don’t owe ….
Aren’t we talking about your daughter?

306
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:58,223
—Shouldn’t she know her father?
—She has a father, a good father.

307
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:01,770
I don’t know what the hell to say.

308
00:44:02,573 --> 00:44:06,669
What you did is so wrong.
You know that, right?

309
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:11,837
But you have to tell her.
You owe her and you owe me.

310
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:16,482
She doesn’t give a shit.

311
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:23,583
You are so infuriating.

312
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:28,087
Is that the language you use
in this house?

313
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:39,302
I just think that it would be good
if you told her.

314
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,439
If you don’t, I will.

315
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:03,793
I’m going to see what’s going on.

316
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:11,454
We thought he was dead.

317
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:14,895
—We didn’t think he existed.
—You’re still lying.

318
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:19,693
I’m not lying. Jørgen tried to
find him in India lots of times.

319
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:24,235
He never reacted so we
assumed that he wasn’t ….

320
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:27,942
—I don’t have time for this, Mum.
—Jacob was a big, immature child!

321
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:30,102
He fucked everything with a pulse.

322
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:32,513
He was drinking himself
to death.

323
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:36,349
He did drugs. He had grand ideas,
but did nothing.

324
00:47:36,486 --> 00:47:39,319
He probably means well,
but you can’t trust him.

325
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:43,688
—He wants to save everyone, but ….
—I don’t care if he’s fucked a goat.

326
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:45,955
I have a right to know
who my father is.

327
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:49,724
—You can’t manipulate people like that.
—We’re not.

328
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:53,202
Fuck off and leave us alone!

329
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:57,629
Not right now.

330
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:07,409
You’re far out.

331
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:10,587
What’s Jørgen’s reaction?

332
00:48:14,524 --> 00:48:15,582
Anna …?

333
00:48:27,304 --> 00:48:29,772
—Should I come along?
—No.

334
00:48:31,341 --> 00:48:32,933
I’ll wait here, okay?

335
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:26,520
Would you like to come in?
I mean, please come in.

336
00:49:26,663 --> 00:49:27,891
Thanks.

337
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:48,547
I don’t know what to say.
It’s a little new to me.

338
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:52,114
For me too.

339
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,953
Didn’t you know I existed?

340
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:02,522
I’m sorry.

341
00:50:04,101 --> 00:50:08,333
You shouldn’t say sorry. You’re
the only one who can’t be blamed.

342
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:13,037
—Would you like a Coke?
—Yes, please.

343
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,306
I think we’ve got one here.

344
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:23,080
—There aren’t any more. Some water?
—That’s fine.

345
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:31,754
—He’s nice … Christian.
—Yes, Christian.

346
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:33,988
He’s waiting in the car.

347
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:45,707
—Mum said you were dead.
—Well, okay.

348
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:50,872
But apparently I’m not.

349
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:56,579
Would you like a glass?

350
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:09,929
It’s a little tight. It needs a ….

351
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:25,041
How long are you staying?
Do you have time to meet?

352
00:51:25,348 --> 00:51:29,182
Yes.
I’d like that very much.

353
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,754
—I’m here all the time.
—I could call.

354
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:34,317
Yes.

355
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:40,256
—Or I could give you my number.
—If you’ve got one, I’d like that.

356
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:43,755
—Now you know I exist.
—Yes.

357
00:51:44,568 --> 00:51:48,368
I’ve got a pencil and some paper.

358
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:01,646
—Here you go.
—Thanks.

359
00:52:32,415 --> 00:52:34,713
I better go now.

360
00:52:39,022 --> 00:52:40,421
Bye.

361
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:03,739
I’ll be home very soon.

362
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:37,177
Do I have any brothers or sisters?

363
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:44,010
—No, not really.
—What do you mean?

364
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:48,222
There’s a little boy
at the orphanage called Pramod.

365
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:51,227
—Pramod?
—Pramod, yes.

366
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:54,888
I’ve taken care of him
since he was a baby.

367
00:53:55,765 --> 00:54:00,725
—How old is he now?
—He’ll turn eight in precisely a week.

368
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:08,901
He’s this big. He’s tiny,
but he wants to be a footballer.

369
00:54:15,352 --> 00:54:19,618
Maybe it’s stupid, but I brought some
pictures, if you’d like to see them.

370
00:54:19,789 --> 00:54:21,620
Yes, please.

371
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:41,066
Here I’m taking a bath.

372
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:49,714
That’s Lennart,
my first boyfriend.

373
00:54:50,186 --> 00:54:52,518
He had a moped.

374
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:57,418
—But he didn’t want me.
—Why not?

375
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:02,227
Because I beat him at table tennis.
It destroyed him.

376
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:04,424
You can’t do that!

377
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:15,368
That was in Italy.

378
00:55:15,845 --> 00:55:18,905
That’s Da … Jørgen.

379
00:55:33,463 --> 00:55:35,863
Was I silly to bring them?

380
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:39,395
No, I’d like to see them all.

381
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:24,644
What happened back then?

382
00:56:26,983 --> 00:56:29,042
Why didn’t you come home?

383
00:56:31,988 --> 00:56:35,219
I just didn’t.
We had broken up.

384
00:56:36,459 --> 00:56:39,394
And you were drunk
all the time, right?

385
00:56:41,931 --> 00:56:43,728
Yeah.

386
00:56:45,468 --> 00:56:47,436
And you did her friend?

387
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:53,838
Yep, I think I actually did that.

388
00:56:56,312 --> 00:56:58,906
—Would you like dessert?
—Yes, please.

389
00:57:09,626 --> 00:57:13,187
Jacob, I am glad you came anyway.

390
00:57:14,197 --> 00:57:17,257
I thought it all through yesterday

391
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:20,531
and I became convinced
we must continue.

392
00:57:22,405 --> 00:57:26,239
You would like to continue?
As though nothing’s happened?

393
00:57:26,376 --> 00:57:29,209
Yes, it fits even better now.

394
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:35,813
—Well, let’s try then.
—Are you hungry?

395
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:37,710
We need some lunch.

396
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:40,716
We’re going to lunch.

397
00:57:51,034 --> 00:57:55,266
Wasn’t it strange meeting
her again … Helene?

398
00:57:56,539 --> 00:57:57,904
Yes.

399
00:58:00,743 --> 00:58:03,610
Don’t you think she’s ageing well?

400
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:10,116
She’s still extremely beautiful.

401
00:58:13,923 --> 00:58:15,356
Cheers!

402
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:18,322
Cheers.

403
00:58:24,634 --> 00:58:29,901
Why was I at that wedding, Jørgen?
You knew.

404
00:58:29,939 --> 00:58:34,933
I didn’t know.
I didn’t know you were that Jacob.

405
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:40,107
—I don’t believe that.
—Well, I can’t change anything now.

406
00:58:45,321 --> 00:58:47,050
What do you want?

407
00:58:49,058 --> 00:58:53,893
—The honest or the official answer?
—I’d like the honest answer.

408
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,892
I’m just a good person.

409
00:59:10,346 --> 00:59:14,544
There’s not much in this.
We better complain.

410
00:59:16,786 --> 00:59:20,347
—I don’t need any more.
—We need another bottle.

411
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:28,223
It’s the best way to get to know
people. Another bottle.

412
00:59:28,264 --> 00:59:32,792
—I don’t think that would be wise.
—You’re not paid to think.

413
00:59:33,636 --> 00:59:37,470
Either bring another bottle
or bring your boss.

414
00:59:38,541 --> 00:59:41,203
Understand?
Or should I ask him to translate?

415
00:59:41,544 --> 00:59:47,073
—I need to go.
—Why? We’d like another drink.

416
00:59:47,116 --> 00:59:52,486
—What’s the problem?
—We need a bottle of schnapps.

417
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:55,490
We can’t serve you
when you’re so drunk.

418
00:59:56,526 --> 01:00:00,690
So drunk?
I’ve only just gotten started.

419
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:03,822
—It’s a policy we have.
—A policy?

420
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:10,232
A policy?
That’s a damned bad argument.

421
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:13,800
If you want to get on in the world,
you need to make decisions.

422
01:00:13,843 --> 01:00:18,303
When you break policies,
you show decisiveness.

423
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:20,373
Yes, and I think you should go home.

424
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:22,611
You stupid little arsehole.

425
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:26,780
Who do you think you’re talking to?

426
01:00:26,823 --> 01:00:30,919
—Run off and get another bottle.
—Jørgen, we’ll go somewhere else.

427
01:00:32,362 --> 01:00:35,092
I’m not the only one that’s drunk.

428
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:44,967
Coming?

429
01:00:45,608 --> 01:00:47,166
I’m sorry.

430
01:01:20,276 --> 01:01:22,506
Empty already?

431
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:27,172
Those silly little bottles.

432
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:30,615
—Mother helped too.
—That’s good.

433
01:01:32,555 --> 01:01:38,016
Helene, I would like to have a party
on my birthday. It would be nice.

434
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:44,292
Sure, but is one bottle
of whiskey each enough?

435
01:01:49,605 --> 01:01:53,166
Jørgen, would you please tell me
what this is all about?

436
01:01:58,915 --> 01:02:01,110
I couldn’t be bothered.

437
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:05,143
We’re getting up early tomorrow
and driving far.

438
01:02:06,823 --> 01:02:09,087
Why won’t you let Jacob go home?

439
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:14,161
You can’t just run our lives
in your sick head.

440
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:24,768
Do you know what really
doesn’t suit you?

441
01:02:24,807 --> 01:02:29,676
—When you feel sorry for yourself.
—Don’t talk to me like that.

442
01:02:29,812 --> 01:02:33,373
But I don’t understand
what you’re talking about!

443
01:02:33,783 --> 01:02:36,980
What have I done wrong, Helene?

444
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:40,487
Can’t you tell me what
I’ve done wrong?

445
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:45,459
I’ve made a deal with Jacob.
You should be happy.

446
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:05,403
If you’re so bored,
get another job or a hobby.

447
01:03:05,515 --> 01:03:10,350
Instead of going around
making my life hell.

448
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:21,458
Fine, as long as I get peace.

449
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:40,375
Helene!

450
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:49,654
I must admit it got a little wet.

451
01:03:51,127 --> 01:03:55,029
—I hope I didn’t scare you.
—It takes more than that.

452
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:58,327
—How about a drink?
—It’s a little early.

453
01:03:58,467 --> 01:04:03,700
I’ve changed the plans a little,
so it will take a few more days.

454
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:06,206
Why? I can’t do that.

455
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:11,503
I need to be back in two days.

456
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:14,707
Listen.
Instead of an annual donation ….

457
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:18,912
I’ve talked to my advisors
about establishing a fund.

458
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:23,321
It means something to all of us
that you’re Anna’s biological father.

459
01:04:24,493 --> 01:04:28,259
So I’m establishing the fund
in Anna’s and your name.

460
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:32,390
You two will decide
how the money is spent.

461
01:04:32,535 --> 01:04:35,368
So you’ve chosen my project?

462
01:04:35,504 --> 01:04:39,838
—I just said that.
—And you want me to do it with Anna?

463
01:04:40,176 --> 01:04:44,135
Yes, why not? She has shown
a great interest in aid work.

464
01:04:44,747 --> 01:04:48,877
My advisors have gone through
everything and agree

465
01:04:49,018 --> 01:04:53,182
that a sum of 12 million
dollars is realistic.

466
01:04:56,225 --> 01:05:00,355
—12 million dollars?
—I know the dollar is low.

467
01:05:02,598 --> 01:05:05,158
All kidding aside.

468
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:07,830
You can quickly see

469
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:13,499
that it will cover a whole year
for 65,000 children.

470
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:19,543
Including room, board,
school and administration.

471
01:05:19,949 --> 01:05:22,008
65,000 children.

472
01:05:22,385 --> 01:05:26,913
That’s more than are born
in Denmark in a year.

473
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:36,292
Think of what that money could do.
You could really do something.

474
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:46,539
—What do you get out of this?
—Nothing. I keep my good life.

475
01:05:46,676 --> 01:05:52,706
I buy remission for my sins.
And we’re almost family.

476
01:05:52,848 --> 01:05:57,649
—Why are you doing this?
—I’m assuming you’re interested.

477
01:05:57,787 --> 01:06:01,883
Yes, damn it.
Of course I’m interested.

478
01:06:04,527 --> 01:06:07,291
Jacob, stay here.

479
01:06:07,563 --> 01:06:09,861
You’ll get to know Anna better.

480
01:06:10,433 --> 01:06:13,425
You could take out Helene for dinner.

481
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:19,130
I’m going to to Sweden
with the twins. We’re going fishing.

482
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:21,106
You’re a strange man, Jørgen.

483
01:06:21,243 --> 01:06:25,475
She has to eat.
She’s a terrible cook.

484
01:06:33,389 --> 01:06:37,018
—Take care of yourselves, okay?
—We will, Mother.

485
01:06:38,127 --> 01:06:44,327
—Don’t lose too much online.
—I won $235 last night.

486
01:06:45,234 --> 01:06:48,101
Congratulations.
Try and hang on to them.

487
01:06:48,804 --> 01:06:53,707
—Mum did it up wrong.
—We can’t have that.

488
01:06:57,046 --> 01:06:59,981
There. Hop inside.
Thanks.

489
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:02,541
I want to come with you.

490
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:07,378
No, out of the question.
You don’t want to, Helene.

491
01:07:07,423 --> 01:07:12,360
It’s sons and their father in the woods.
Or else they’ll turn out gay.

492
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:19,063
Promise to use a life vest and
water wings. And the boys too.

493
01:07:25,307 --> 01:07:27,332
—Bye bye!
—Bye.

494
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:40,384
—Can we talk?
—What do you want to talk about?

495
01:07:41,257 --> 01:07:44,055
—We could start with Jørgen?
—Stop already.

496
01:07:44,493 --> 01:07:47,223
Listen. Can I come in?

497
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:49,197
Thanks.

498
01:07:57,239 --> 01:08:01,699
—So talk about Jørgen.
—Can we sit down?

499
01:08:01,844 --> 01:08:03,835
We could find a chair.

500
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:08,145
This is fine. May I sit here?

501
01:08:08,851 --> 01:08:10,375
Okay ….

502
01:08:14,457 --> 01:08:18,450
Did you know Jørgen asked me
to administer a fund?

503
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:22,086
—No. What fund?
—It’s aid work. With Anna.

504
01:08:23,966 --> 01:08:26,127
—You’ll run it with Anna?
—With Anna.

505
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:31,763
It’s a very generous offer,
but he’s dragging things out.

506
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:34,633
I want to know what’s going on.

507
01:08:34,677 --> 01:08:37,578
If it’s one of your games,
I want it to stop.

508
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:42,778
Stop being paranoid. You don’t have
to be poor to have good intentions.

509
01:08:42,918 --> 01:08:44,977
There are people
with money and ideals.

510
01:08:45,154 --> 01:08:48,089
—Really? I’d like to meet one.
—Hello, Jacob.

511
01:08:48,224 --> 01:08:51,318
Give me a break.
You never had any ideals.

512
01:08:51,460 --> 01:08:55,521
I could be rude about your ideals
and we could go on and on.

513
01:08:57,333 --> 01:09:01,963
—We could go on being rude ….
—Then tell me what he wants.

514
01:09:03,272 --> 01:09:06,764
He doesn’t care about the orphanage
or humanitarian work.

515
01:09:06,909 --> 01:09:11,209
It’s bad business.
What does he want?

516
01:09:15,784 --> 01:09:20,551
I don’t know what he wants to do
with the orphanage and Anna.

517
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:23,191
I don’t understand it, Jacob.

518
01:09:24,627 --> 01:09:26,891
Then let me ask you a different way:

519
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:30,592
Do you know something I don’t?

520
01:09:32,535 --> 01:09:35,163
No, Jacob, I know nothing.

521
01:09:40,376 --> 01:09:42,674
That’s all I wanted to know.

522
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:55,881
—May I offer you a cup of coffee?
—No, thanks.

523
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:05,393
—Dare I offer you a glass of wine?
—Only if you’ve got enough.

524
01:10:05,935 --> 01:10:07,493
Right.

525
01:10:17,646 --> 01:10:20,137
Dare I ask how you’ve been?

526
01:10:23,786 --> 01:10:27,950
The last twenty years?
They’ve been a bit up and down.

527
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:30,081
And you?

528
01:10:30,626 --> 01:10:33,094
I’ve been fine.

529
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,596
Also a bit hectic.

530
01:10:36,732 --> 01:10:40,634
—I just got a daughter.
—Congratulations.

531
01:10:50,813 --> 01:10:54,510
—Do you have a wife?
—No.

532
01:10:55,017 --> 01:10:57,349
—You haven’t married?
—No.

533
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:00,684
A girlfriend?

534
01:11:02,191 --> 01:11:03,453
No.

535
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:07,024
—Is it rude of me to ask?
—No, no.

536
01:11:12,234 --> 01:11:15,328
—Why don’t I get that wine?
—Good idea.

537
01:11:26,715 --> 01:11:31,345
When I went home,
I thought you would follow me.

538
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:40,319
I thought so too.

539
01:11:53,342 --> 01:11:56,140
I thought you would come back.

540
01:11:58,480 --> 01:11:59,538
You did?

541
01:12:12,461 --> 01:12:14,793
But we didn’t.

542
01:13:19,661 --> 01:13:21,788
We should go to India.

543
01:13:25,334 --> 01:13:27,165
—Why?
—It’s warm.

544
01:13:28,637 --> 01:13:30,764
They’ve got good hotels.

545
01:13:32,508 --> 01:13:34,100
Stop it.

546
01:13:35,344 --> 01:13:36,936
Why?

547
01:13:39,615 --> 01:13:44,211
Look at this apartment. We’re lying
on a mattress. There’s lots to do.

548
01:13:44,887 --> 01:13:47,082
—It doesn’t matter.
—It does.

549
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:52,588
—And we’re going to Val-d’Isère.
—We can go there, but not India?

550
01:13:53,495 --> 01:13:55,326
Give me a break.

551
01:13:56,865 --> 01:14:00,460
Ever since you met
your real, holy father

552
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:02,866
you’ve been really
irritating to be with.

553
01:14:03,505 --> 01:14:07,669
What about us? It’s always
Jacob, Jacob, Jacob, all the time.

554
01:14:09,711 --> 01:14:12,407
You can’t change things now, Anna.

555
01:14:18,921 --> 01:14:20,912
Hello.

556
01:14:33,168 --> 01:14:35,466
Why are you sitting here?

557
01:14:36,038 --> 01:14:39,667
Sweetheart!
It’s lovely to see you.

558
01:14:41,109 --> 01:14:45,341
—I can’t stand it when we fight.
—Me neither.

559
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:49,580
But we need to talk
about this properly.

560
01:14:50,452 --> 01:14:53,580
—Yes.
—Like grown-ups.

561
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:59,124
—Of course, sweetie.
—So stop calling me sweetie.

562
01:15:01,029 --> 01:15:04,658
—What can I call you then?
—You could call me Anna.

563
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:06,895
Okay.

564
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:20,980
Did you marry Jørgen for my sake?

565
01:15:22,317 --> 01:15:24,478
So that I had a father?

566
01:15:25,954 --> 01:15:27,615
No.

567
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:32,190
I love Jørgen.

568
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:36,058
Do you?

569
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:39,596
A lot.

570
01:15:40,802 --> 01:15:43,930
So everything with Jacob
was a mistake?

571
01:15:47,843 --> 01:15:50,505
—No.
—What was it then?

572
01:15:54,483 --> 01:15:59,580
I was very in love with Jacob,
but I was also very unhappy.

573
01:16:00,756 --> 01:16:01,916
About what?

574
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:08,924
About being in love with him.

575
01:16:12,034 --> 01:16:15,197
We just hurt each other all the time.

576
01:16:21,343 --> 01:16:23,937
When you told me
Jørgen wasn’t my father—

577
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:26,840
why didn’t you say Jacob was?

578
01:16:35,223 --> 01:16:40,991
Maybe because …
because I wanted to forget him.

579
01:16:42,197 --> 01:16:43,926
Did you?

580
01:16:45,968 --> 01:16:50,098
Well … I thought so.

581
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:59,113
—Who drove off last night?
—It was Jacob.

582
01:16:59,915 --> 01:17:03,646
I thought Johannes drove him,
but he couldn’t have.

583
01:17:05,087 --> 01:17:08,818
—Jørgen lent him to Jacob.
—He never lends out Johannes.

584
01:17:09,558 --> 01:17:11,389
He did to Jacob.

585
01:17:12,194 --> 01:17:15,891
It seems he is giving it all
to that Jacob.

586
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:23,597
Helene Hansson. I’d like to speak
to Doctor Phillipsen.

587
01:18:49,925 --> 01:18:52,951
Remember to lie.
How big was it?

588
01:18:53,095 --> 01:18:58,260
You have to agree or she won’t
believe it …. Good, off you go.

589
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:09,275
—We caught one that was this big.
—No way!

590
01:19:09,778 --> 01:19:12,611
It’s true, but it got away.

591
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:18,780
I have to go to town.

592
01:19:19,521 --> 01:19:22,490
Jørgen?
Won’t you stay for lunch?

593
01:19:22,657 --> 01:19:25,956
We ate on the way.
I’ll be home in a few hours.

594
01:19:29,297 --> 01:19:31,424
—Jørgen? I spoke to Doctor Phillipsen.
—Yes.

595
01:19:41,042 --> 01:19:46,742
Phillipsen’s under confidentiality.
That’s totally unacceptable.

596
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:51,184
He promised me.
He’s betrayed my trust.

597
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:56,481
You had promised him to tell me
after the wedding, right?

598
01:19:58,226 --> 01:20:00,888
You’ve known for five months.

599
01:20:03,732 --> 01:20:08,635
I want to let it be for now, Helene.

600
01:20:12,774 --> 01:20:15,242
You don’t have the time.

601
01:20:20,182 --> 01:20:21,171
What will you do?

602
01:20:21,316 --> 01:20:25,616
Anna and the boys must not know
before it’s absolutely necessary.

603
01:20:26,221 --> 01:20:30,453
Are you listening?
Not before it’s absolutely necessary.

604
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:33,391
—Do you understand?
—Yes.

605
01:20:34,129 --> 01:20:36,222
We’ll figure something out.

606
01:20:36,898 --> 01:20:39,230
There’s always a solution.

607
01:20:39,901 --> 01:20:42,893
There’s always something
in America ….

608
01:20:44,005 --> 01:20:45,666
—There’s nothing to do.
—Yes, there is.

609
01:20:46,007 --> 01:20:48,532
There’s nothing to do!

610
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:50,869
—There’s …
—No!

611
01:20:51,713 --> 01:20:56,082
—There’s nothing to do, understand?
—You can’t die!

612
01:20:56,451 --> 01:21:01,081
We don’t get to decide, damn it.
Let go. Get out.

613
01:21:01,223 --> 01:21:05,216
Get out of the damn car
before I throw you out!

614
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:07,658
Shut the door!

615
01:21:38,360 --> 01:21:40,851
How long will you stay there?

616
01:22:29,377 --> 01:22:32,778
So, here you are.
Please excuse the formalities.

617
01:22:33,348 --> 01:22:36,215
You only need to read
the last three pages.

618
01:22:37,719 --> 01:22:40,517
Did Helene invite you
to my birthday?

619
01:22:40,555 --> 01:22:44,321
—No.
—You can’t rely on her.

620
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:48,561
—Then I better do it.
—Thanks.

621
01:22:49,731 --> 01:22:53,724
There are a few things I don’t
understand. Can we look at it?

622
01:22:56,571 --> 01:22:58,505
What does that mean?

623
01:22:59,607 --> 01:23:03,771
It means that you and Anna have
100% control of the fund.

624
01:23:03,945 --> 01:23:07,472
No, not that. Here it is.

625
01:23:07,515 --> 01:23:11,975
The part where it says
I have to live in Denmark.

626
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:15,214
Yes, we haven’t talked about that yet.

627
01:23:15,357 --> 01:23:20,420
To build an organization like that
you have to live in Denmark.

628
01:23:20,562 --> 01:23:24,658
Can’t I just come to board meetings?

629
01:23:24,699 --> 01:23:27,031
No, it’s a demand on my behalf.

630
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:33,373
Why should I do that?

631
01:23:33,508 --> 01:23:37,342
Because I said
it’s a demand on my behalf.

632
01:23:41,516 --> 01:23:47,580
You mean that? I can’t spend half
a year here and half a year there?

633
01:23:47,622 --> 01:23:51,558
Have I said anything I don’t mean?

634
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:03,368
Maybe everyone else
kisses your arse, but I won’t.

635
01:24:06,174 --> 01:24:08,574
—What do you mean?
—You’ve lost your mind. What is that?

636
01:24:10,412 --> 01:24:16,544
Is that why I came? To meet Anna
and see Helene? You want to buy me?

637
01:24:16,718 --> 01:24:20,176
—I don’t want to buy you.
—That’s what it says here.

638
01:24:20,321 --> 01:24:22,516
Fine, then let’s say that.

639
01:24:22,557 --> 01:24:25,424
Think of what you could do
with the money.

640
01:24:26,027 --> 01:24:30,123
How many you could help.
Wouldn’t you sell yourself for that?

641
01:24:30,265 --> 01:24:33,894
—Come on. I know you would.
—You don’t know shit about me.

642
01:24:34,235 --> 01:24:37,602
I know all about you.
You’re a good person.

643
01:24:37,639 --> 01:24:39,607
Naïve, but well-intentioned.

644
01:24:39,741 --> 01:24:44,474
Except for some water projects
and some schools in Bangalore

645
01:24:44,779 --> 01:24:49,716
not one of your projects has
succeeded in the last 15 years.

646
01:24:50,652 --> 01:24:54,315
You’re good at finding people to help,
but not at financing it.

647
01:24:54,456 --> 01:24:59,052
—You’ve been checking me out?
—Your orphanage has to close.

648
01:24:59,394 --> 01:25:03,990
All your sweet little kids
will be on the street again.

649
01:25:04,132 --> 01:25:06,293
You fat pig.

650
01:25:06,334 --> 01:25:12,204
Is it fun playing God,
you big, fat pig? It’s not true.

651
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:15,673
I’m just saying that
you’re lying to yourself.

652
01:25:15,810 --> 01:25:19,769
You’re an idiot
if you don’t take this chance.

653
01:25:23,017 --> 01:25:25,508
You can kiss my arse, Jørgen.

654
01:25:45,406 --> 01:25:48,136
—Jacob, wait.
—I don’t want to talk to you.

655
01:25:48,176 --> 01:25:50,076
You’re right, Jacob.

656
01:25:50,111 --> 01:25:53,877
Don’t touch me!
I don’t have time for this.

657
01:25:53,915 --> 01:25:58,545
I am sick, damn it!
I’m the one that is out of time.

658
01:26:00,922 --> 01:26:02,753
Jacob, I am dying.

659
01:26:06,961 --> 01:26:11,091
You have to stay and do
what we have decided.

660
01:26:11,833 --> 01:26:17,567
—Nothing has been decided.
—Anna will need you.

661
01:26:22,410 --> 01:26:24,435
And Helene …

662
01:26:30,018 --> 01:26:32,418
and the boys ….

663
01:26:38,526 --> 01:26:41,051
They’re so young, Jacob.

664
01:26:46,901 --> 01:26:48,334
Look at me, Jacob!

665
01:26:55,643 --> 01:26:59,545
Don’t you see that
there is a point to all of this?

666
01:27:05,019 --> 01:27:07,886
You have a responsibility here, Jacob.

667
01:27:14,062 --> 01:27:18,055
Do I have to live on the other
side of the world to get your help?

668
01:28:08,016 --> 01:28:10,109
Hi, Anna. It’s Jacob.

669
01:28:11,185 --> 01:28:14,985
Would you please call me?
I need to speak to you.

670
01:28:16,958 --> 01:28:18,949
Call as soon as you can.

671
01:28:45,019 --> 01:28:48,216
I’m leaving now. I have to go
take care of my hubby.

672
01:29:10,778 --> 01:29:12,871
Is something wrong?

673
01:29:14,215 --> 01:29:17,912
—Can I sleep here?
—Yes, of course.

674
01:29:22,056 --> 01:29:23,580
Anna, what happened?

675
01:29:34,268 --> 01:29:35,860
There.

676
01:32:25,273 --> 01:32:27,070
Hi, sweetheart.

677
01:32:44,725 --> 01:32:47,819
—Are you managing?
—I’m okay.

678
01:32:50,831 --> 01:32:53,197
He’s been calling all morning.

679
01:32:54,368 --> 01:32:56,962
—I don’t ever want to talk to him.
—No.

680
01:33:04,478 --> 01:33:07,470
—Would you like some breakfast?
—No, thanks.

681
01:33:08,049 --> 01:33:10,916
—I need some breakfast.
—Yes, you do.

682
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:15,386
—Want anything?
—A glass of juice maybe.

683
01:33:19,961 --> 01:33:21,622
What a little arsehole.

684
01:33:24,098 --> 01:33:26,396
What a stupid little boy.

685
01:33:28,436 --> 01:33:31,599
—Thank you for coming.
—Of course I came.

686
01:33:33,674 --> 01:33:38,043
I’ll get a room though,
so I don’t have to commute.

687
01:33:38,946 --> 01:33:43,007
I brought my teddy bear pyjamas,
some cookies and a glass of water—

688
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:45,084
sloshing about in my bag.

689
01:33:47,488 --> 01:33:50,321
I haven’t been in Copenhagen this often
since university.

690
01:33:50,358 --> 01:33:52,383
I delivered papers.

691
01:33:52,426 --> 01:33:57,796
—You did?
—I sold flowers pretending to be blind.

692
01:34:02,703 --> 01:34:06,503
Helene, you have to tell her.

693
01:34:11,379 --> 01:34:13,404
Jørgen doesn’t want us to.

694
01:34:15,416 --> 01:34:18,351
What are you going to do?

695
01:34:34,735 --> 01:34:36,635
I don’t know.

696
01:34:53,087 --> 01:34:54,918
Here comes breakfast.

697
01:35:03,397 --> 01:35:06,662
It turns out I was hungry after all.

698
01:35:10,571 --> 01:35:12,562
May I see?

699
01:35:14,175 --> 01:35:17,440
You look so beautiful.
You’re so lovely.

700
01:35:19,847 --> 01:35:21,178
Yes, you are.

701
01:35:23,350 --> 01:35:27,548
And you’re so soft.
And you smell so nice.

702
01:35:28,489 --> 01:35:30,821
I forgot your juice.

703
01:35:37,665 --> 01:35:40,998
That’s all we needed.
That dumb juice.

704
01:35:43,404 --> 01:35:46,931
I’m sorry ….

705
01:36:29,416 --> 01:36:31,816
There. Jacob.

706
01:36:33,454 --> 01:36:34,546
Right there.

707
01:36:40,327 --> 01:36:42,852
—There.
—Thank you.

708
01:36:44,665 --> 01:36:47,793
Jørgen, here you go.

709
01:36:47,935 --> 01:36:49,129
Thanks.

710
01:36:56,010 --> 01:36:58,604
Does anyone have a pen?

711
01:37:03,517 --> 01:37:05,678
Thanks.

712
01:37:14,595 --> 01:37:20,090
Anna signed yesterday,
so now I’m a poor man.

713
01:37:21,135 --> 01:37:22,693
Almost.

714
01:37:23,237 --> 01:37:25,296
—Your daughter is here.
—Anna?

715
01:37:26,774 --> 01:37:28,935
Then show her in.

716
01:37:33,347 --> 01:37:38,546
—Well, thank you for your time.
—You’re leaving and she’s coming?

717
01:37:39,053 --> 01:37:41,749
I don’t think she came
to talk to me.

718
01:37:43,057 --> 01:37:46,618
—I didn’t expect her to come today.
—Me neither.

719
01:38:13,087 --> 01:38:15,282
—Are you okay?
—Yes.

720
01:38:15,322 --> 01:38:18,314
He had to hurry to the bank.

721
01:38:20,761 --> 01:38:23,628
—Hi. Good to see you.
—Hi, Anna.

722
01:38:24,164 --> 01:38:26,860
I didn’t think you were
coming today.

723
01:38:41,682 --> 01:38:43,980
Why didn’t you tell me?

724
01:38:46,820 --> 01:38:49,755
Why haven’t you told me yourself?

725
01:38:52,726 --> 01:38:55,286
Why do you keep lying to me?

726
01:38:55,329 --> 01:38:57,388
Sorry, Anna ….

727
01:39:03,304 --> 01:39:05,670
I didn’t want to make you sad.

728
01:39:05,806 --> 01:39:10,505
Did you think I wouldn’t be sad
if you just died one day?

729
01:39:15,115 --> 01:39:17,481
—No ….
—What?

730
01:39:22,890 --> 01:39:26,587
I didn’t want you to see me …

731
01:39:27,528 --> 01:39:30,622
as a dead man before I was.

732
01:39:31,432 --> 01:39:36,995
I wanted us to be together as much
as possible before anyone knew.

733
01:39:41,742 --> 01:39:48,147
If I knew you were dying, I wouldn’t
spend my time doing other stuff.

734
01:39:50,317 --> 01:39:53,809
And I want you to tell me
these things.

735
01:39:55,122 --> 01:39:58,785
I want you to tell me.

736
01:40:07,067 --> 01:40:10,503
Anna, you mustn’t cry now.

737
01:40:11,271 --> 01:40:14,365
It will hurt …

738
01:40:14,508 --> 01:40:19,343
but it will pass,
just like everything else.

739
01:40:20,381 --> 01:40:24,112
And now Jacob will be with you.

740
01:40:24,151 --> 01:40:27,314
I don’t care about Jacob.

741
01:40:27,855 --> 01:40:32,292
You’re my father and you
didn’t tell me you’re dying.

742
01:40:34,328 --> 01:40:38,196
I don’t want anyone but you.

743
01:40:39,333 --> 01:40:45,568
If you don’t tell me you’re dying,
I can’t say the things I want to say.

744
01:40:45,739 --> 01:40:48,037
To say that …

745
01:40:48,208 --> 01:40:50,506
I love you …

746
01:40:50,644 --> 01:40:54,171
and that I don’t want you to die …

747
01:40:54,314 --> 01:40:56,612
and lots of other things ….

748
01:40:56,650 --> 01:40:58,982
Come over here.

749
01:41:13,967 --> 01:41:15,832
I love you.

750
01:41:29,450 --> 01:41:31,441
Shouldn’t you hurry up?

751
01:41:46,033 --> 01:41:47,898
They’ll be here soon.

752
01:41:50,604 --> 01:41:52,367
You look great.

753
01:41:59,413 --> 01:42:01,506
Thank you.

754
01:42:10,757 --> 01:42:13,419
There, come on.

755
01:42:21,768 --> 01:42:25,067
—Are you still up?
—It’s skateboarding.

756
01:42:25,205 --> 01:42:28,606
Is it skateboarding?
Is it exciting?

757
01:42:28,742 --> 01:42:31,870
—Move!
—It’s really exciting.

758
01:42:32,012 --> 01:42:33,843
Move!

759
01:42:37,184 --> 01:42:40,676
Then you have to go to bed
in half an hour.

760
01:42:41,688 --> 01:42:43,246
Sleep tight.

761
01:42:48,395 --> 01:42:52,855
Jørgen was a diplomat,
so he was sent down there.

762
01:42:52,900 --> 01:42:56,495
He sat down in the chair
and he didn’t say a word.

763
01:42:56,537 --> 01:43:00,974
Finally Baunsgaard asks,
will they do it by three

764
01:43:01,108 --> 01:43:02,598
or will we have to pay overtime?

765
01:43:02,743 --> 01:43:07,180
Jørgen said, you won’t have
to pay overtime at least.

766
01:43:07,214 --> 01:43:09,774
I just fired all 42 of them.

767
01:43:11,418 --> 01:43:16,117
This story gets better and better.
Last time it was 32.

768
01:43:16,156 --> 01:43:22,322
I don’t know the cost in dollars and
cents, but we almost went bankrupt.

769
01:43:22,462 --> 01:43:25,397
But we had integrity.

770
01:43:27,568 --> 01:43:30,196
Integrity, Jørgen.

771
01:43:31,405 --> 01:43:35,899
—And cheers to that, Jørgen.
—Thanks.

772
01:43:35,943 --> 01:43:37,103
Cheers.

773
01:43:41,815 --> 01:43:46,343
—You’re not drinking much tonight.
—I probably shouldn’t get drunk.

774
01:43:50,924 --> 01:43:53,290
I’ll just start crying.

775
01:44:02,603 --> 01:44:06,164
I feel obliged to say thank you
for all the kind words.

776
01:44:06,974 --> 01:44:10,876
Now I’m not the type that likes
to hear my own voice

777
01:44:11,011 --> 01:44:13,309
in such a well filled room.

778
01:44:14,514 --> 01:44:17,142
But I am turning 48 after all.

779
01:44:17,751 --> 01:44:22,347
And there was so much I didn’t
manage to say when I turned 40 …

780
01:44:22,522 --> 01:44:28,085
and much has happened since,
so I think it’s reasonable

781
01:44:28,262 --> 01:44:31,356
that I be allowed to steal
ten minutes of your precious time.

782
01:44:32,933 --> 01:44:36,425
Because it is. Time is precious.

783
01:44:37,204 --> 01:44:40,264
The years have taught me that.

784
01:44:41,575 --> 01:44:42,769
Helene …

785
01:44:43,910 --> 01:44:48,870
I could stand here and brag
about you for hours.

786
01:44:49,049 --> 01:44:52,041
But don’t worry.
I know you don’t want me to.

787
01:44:53,253 --> 01:44:58,520
But I will say, that even though
you can’t always feel it

788
01:44:59,026 --> 01:45:01,824
I am extremely happy
that you’re with me.

789
01:45:03,697 --> 01:45:06,996
You are night and day,

790
01:45:07,034 --> 01:45:09,525
the heaven and the seas for me.

791
01:45:11,505 --> 01:45:16,340
The time I’m with you

792
01:45:16,376 --> 01:45:18,367
and our wonderful children

793
01:45:18,412 --> 01:45:21,108
confirms exactly
what I would have said.

794
01:45:22,949 --> 01:45:27,079
Every acquaintance,
every friend, every person

795
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:30,385
who has a place in your heart ….

796
01:45:30,424 --> 01:45:34,155
It is the time with them

797
01:45:34,194 --> 01:45:36,594
that really means something.

798
01:45:37,597 --> 01:45:39,963
Nothing else matters.

799
01:45:45,038 --> 01:45:47,097
Apart from the firm, of course.

800
01:45:47,974 --> 01:45:51,535
We’ve expanded a lot recently.

801
01:45:51,878 --> 01:45:55,609
We will continue to,
far into the future, I hope.

802
01:45:57,250 --> 01:45:59,844
Already today, cranes stand

803
01:45:59,886 --> 01:46:02,787
in London, New York and Singapore.

804
01:46:02,823 --> 01:46:06,725
It shouldn’t be long before
we can sleep in our own buildings

805
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:10,696
when we visit
Houston and Manila ….

806
01:46:10,864 --> 01:46:16,268
I’ll anticipate things a little
and invite you all to the opening

807
01:46:16,403 --> 01:46:20,863
of our new headquarters in Singapore
on 5th January next year.

808
01:46:25,579 --> 01:46:29,948
I’m sure my ten minutes are up,
but I am very grateful to you

809
01:46:30,083 --> 01:46:34,019
for wanting to spend
the day with me.

810
01:46:34,154 --> 01:46:38,113
And I would like to propose
a toast to the future. Cheers!

811
01:48:08,148 --> 01:48:09,911
Jørgen?

812
01:48:15,088 --> 01:48:17,613
I talked to the boys’ teacher

813
01:48:17,657 --> 01:48:20,956
about separating them
after the holidays

814
01:48:20,994 --> 01:48:23,121
and moving Morten
into a different class.

815
01:48:23,163 --> 01:48:25,290
It sounded quite reasonable.

816
01:48:25,332 --> 01:48:29,894
Because they’re more ….
There are not so many cliques and ….

817
01:48:30,871 --> 01:48:36,309
—Why are you telling me?
—Would you like a glass of water?

818
01:48:36,543 --> 01:48:38,511
Helene, come here.

819
01:48:46,987 --> 01:48:50,616
Why are you telling me this?

820
01:48:50,657 --> 01:48:53,387
Because we have to decide.

821
01:48:53,426 --> 01:48:56,327
You don’t need me anymore, Helene.

822
01:48:58,164 --> 01:49:00,724
Everything is taken
care of now, right?

823
01:49:01,434 --> 01:49:03,595
Anna and the boys …

824
01:49:06,006 --> 01:49:09,874
I’ll just slow you all down.

825
01:49:10,243 --> 01:49:13,178
—Stop.
—No.

826
01:49:16,983 --> 01:49:19,781
I’m the only one stopping for now.

827
01:49:22,589 --> 01:49:24,614
I just mean ….

828
01:49:29,095 --> 01:49:33,896
Do you think you and Jacob
will get together? Do you?

829
01:49:37,470 --> 01:49:39,563
Stop it.

830
01:49:42,375 --> 01:49:44,605
I would like to know.

831
01:49:45,745 --> 01:49:48,475
I just didn’t want …

832
01:49:49,649 --> 01:49:54,177
you to see me … like this.

833
01:49:56,222 --> 01:49:58,656
This is only the beginning, Helene.

834
01:49:58,992 --> 01:50:04,225
It will get worse from now on.

835
01:50:04,364 --> 01:50:07,800
—Can you manage?
—Yes.

836
01:50:22,749 --> 01:50:26,845
I’m so damned pathetic ….

837
01:50:35,762 --> 01:50:39,061
I don’t want to ….

838
01:50:42,235 --> 01:50:45,534
I don’t want to die!

839
01:50:51,011 --> 01:50:55,209
I don’t, Helene.
I don’t want to, damn it!

840
01:50:57,350 --> 01:51:01,309
I don’t want to die!
I don’t!

841
01:51:08,028 --> 01:51:09,928
Damn it!

842
01:51:10,597 --> 01:51:13,065
God damn it!

843
01:51:14,968 --> 01:51:18,734
I don’t want to!

844
01:51:19,139 --> 01:51:22,939
I don’t want to die, Helene.

845
01:51:26,813 --> 01:51:29,373
Why …?

846
01:52:36,816 --> 01:52:41,719
Praise be to God,
our Lord Jesus Christ

847
01:52:41,755 --> 01:52:45,953
who by his great mercy
has granted us hope

848
01:52:46,926 --> 01:52:51,124
in the resurrection of Jesus Christ
from the dead.

849
01:52:53,233 --> 01:52:56,225
Jørgen Lennart Hansson …

850
01:52:57,637 --> 01:53:01,471
we commit your body to the ground.
Ashes to ashes,

851
01:53:02,609 --> 01:53:04,770
dust to dust.

852
01:53:06,946 --> 01:53:10,882
And to dust thou shalt return.

853
01:53:44,450 --> 01:53:46,247
Goodbye, Dad.

854
01:58:22,328 --> 01:58:24,796
Then go.
