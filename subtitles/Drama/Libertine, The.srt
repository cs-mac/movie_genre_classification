1
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,839
Allow me to be frank
at the commencement

2
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,396
You will not like me.

3
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,165
The gentlemen will be envious
and the ladies will be repelled.

4
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,432
You will not like me now and you will like me
a good deal less as we go on.

5
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,365
Ladies,

6
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,356
an announcement.

7
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,737
I am up for it.

8
00:02:03,772 --> 00:02:05,675
All the time.

9
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,076
That is not a boast or an opinion.

10
00:02:08,111 --> 00:02:10,013
It is bone-hard medical fact.

11
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,916
I put it round, you know.

12
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,273
And you will watch me putting it round
and sigh for it.

13
00:02:16,308 --> 00:02:18,085
Don't.

14
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,838
It is a deal of trouble for you

15
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,510
and you are better off watching and drawing
your conclusions from a distance

16
00:02:23,545 --> 00:02:26,392
than you would be
if I got my tarse up your petticoats.

17
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:29,605
Gentlemen,

18
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,525
do not despair.

19
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,516
I am up for that as well.

20
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,916
And the same warning applies.

21
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,513
Still your cheesy erections till I've had my say,

22
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:42,392
but later when you shag,
and later you will shag,

23
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,485
I shall expect it of you,

24
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,114
and I will know if you have let me down.

25
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,631
I wish you to shag

26
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,679
with my homuncular image
rattling in your gonads.

27
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,005
Feel...

28
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,190
how it was for me, how it is for me.

29
00:02:58,225 --> 00:02:59,916
And ponder.

30
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,511
Was that shudder
the same shudder he sensed?

31
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,989
Did he know something more profound?

32
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,510
Or is there some wall of wretchedness
that we all batter with our heads

33
00:03:11,545 --> 00:03:13,755
at that shining live-long moment?

34
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,605
That is it.

35
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,392
That is my prologue.

36
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,312
Nothing in rhyme.

37
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,553
No protestations of modesty.
You were not expecting that, I hope.

38
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,684
I am John Wilmot.

39
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:29,605
Second Earl of Rochester.

40
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,519
And I do not want you to like me.

41
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,516
MAN: Wren's upset. The clergy approved
the most conventional design for the cathedral.

42
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,598
Now he feels
there's no room for artistic manoeuvre.

43
00:03:56,633 --> 00:03:58,875
SECOND MAN:
Put a sub-clause in the warrant.

44
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,869
"Variations in the design
are to be ornamental rather than essential. "

45
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,156
Then he can do what he wants.

46
00:04:06,191 --> 00:04:08,005
Next.

47
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,589
MAN: There are representations for you
to be more careful in public.

48
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,765
Perhaps a bodyguard.

49
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,836
- Whose idea is that?
- Your brother.

50
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,604
Ha!

51
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:21,268
No-one's going to kill me
if it means having him on the throne.

52
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,392
- Next.
- Danby says the army is costing too much.

53
00:04:24,427 --> 00:04:26,510
It's Danby's job to balance the books.

54
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:30,638
If he thinks it's good economics to disband
the army and be invaded by the French,

55
00:04:30,673 --> 00:04:32,511
he can look for another position.

56
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,805
Anything else?

57
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,877
You asked me to remind you
about the Earl of Rochester.

58
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,155
When did I banish him?

59
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,005
Three months ago.

60
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,996
- For how long?
- A year.

61
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,630
Bring him back. Now.

62
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,155
John.

63
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,119
Be attentive to your wife.
She's not accustomed to London.

64
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,875
Mother, I shall in all things
endeavour to serve her...

65
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:02,676
and you.

66
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,630
Serve God.

67
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,436
You must not fear London.

68
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,636
It is not London I fear.

69
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,276
You abducted me in a coach like this
when I was still a virgin heiress.

70
00:05:41,311 --> 00:05:43,116
And did you like abduction?

71
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,956
Passionately.

72
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,756
Speak of it.

73
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,554
John! This is not the place.

74
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,556
Speak to me of abduction.

75
00:05:56,591 --> 00:05:58,404
I was 18.

76
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:00,794
And worth two and a half thousand a year.

77
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,032
You ambushed me,

78
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,156
bundled me from my coach,

79
00:06:06,191 --> 00:06:07,872
and drove me away.

80
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,553
The King thrust you in the tower for it.

81
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,070
And I dug in my heels
and spurned and shunned the other men.

82
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,879
I would only embrace my dear abductor.

83
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,876
Dryden's new play.

84
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,037
Here, Chas, grab a wodge.

85
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,150
Dryden couldn't write a laundry list.

86
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:25,325
MAN: Rochester!

87
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,590
- Johnny!
- Johnny.

88
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,637
We were pining for you

89
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,398
Even now we're pining.

90
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,160
When I wake in the country,
I dream of being in London,

91
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,158
and then when I get here,
it's full of people like you.

92
00:07:37,193 --> 00:07:39,725
- Johnny.
- This reign's a shambles, do you not think?

93
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:44,151
My father risked life and limb
hiding that thing Charles up an oak tree.

94
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:45,605
Has he forgiven you?

95
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,552
He's forgiven me. I shan't forgive him.

96
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,234
Why did he banish you this time?

97
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,997
Well, it is a fine morning.
I'm walking through the galleries.

98
00:07:55,032 --> 00:07:58,515
The King is walking through the galleries.
I'm splendidly alone.

99
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,559
The King is surrounded
by a slow-moving troop...

100
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,357
.. of Mediterraneans.

101
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,756
- The wife's family.
- And he must make show of me.

102
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,598
Behold, the Earl of Rochester, the wit.

103
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,070
The poet. Pray, let us have some of your muse.

104
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:18,325
What am I to do?

105
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,433
Then I recall in my pocket I have
a sketch of something rustic with nymphs.

106
00:08:22,468 --> 00:08:24,156
I pull it out and deliver.

107
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:31,192
"In the isle of Britain, long since famous grown
For breeding the best cunts in Christendom... "

108
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:36,189
Rat me, thinks I, this is not
the piece of paper I had supposed.

109
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:39,157
The King's eyes are more piercing
than I can remember.

110
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,285
The jaws of his entourage
are decidedly earthbound.

111
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:47,598
This piece of paper is not covered
merely with the thump and slop of congress.

112
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:51,712
This poem is an attack on the monarchy itself.

113
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,230
Culminating in depiction of the royal mistress

114
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:01,114
striving to flog the flaccid royal member
into a state of excitement.

115
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,239
"This you'd believe had I but time to tell you,
The pains it cost to poor laborious Nelly.

116
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:11,316
Whilst she employs hands,
fingers, mouth and thighs,

117
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:15,075
Ere she can raise the member she enjoys.

118
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,119
All monarchs I hate, and the thrones they sit on,

119
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:22,478
From the hector of France to the cully of Britain."

120
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,565
It's damn good, though, Johnny.

121
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,229
Course it's good. That's not the point.
The point is he couldn't appreciate it.

122
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,724
It took me nearly an hour to write it,
just to please him.

123
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:35,991
Three months in the fucking country at the
height of the season. Missed all the good plays.

124
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,435
Boring old Rowley. We love you, Johnny.

125
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,278
Give us a stanza
and we'll laugh in the King's place.

126
00:09:41,313 --> 00:09:44,312
To Etherege, I drink a pledge.

127
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:46,405
His life has run the gamut.

128
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,034
He's penned naught good
since She Would If She Could.

129
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,156
He would if he could but he cannot

130
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,513
Well, Johnny, it is a damn well said thing,
but it ain't true, do you see?

131
00:09:55,548 --> 00:09:57,235
Oh, but it is true, Georgie.

132
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:03,987
You think you can still enjoy the town's esteem
for something you wrote seven years ago.

133
00:10:04,022 --> 00:10:06,109
You can't be promising for ever George

134
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,190
Sooner or later you must do something

135
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:11,989
But that's what I'm saying.
Ihave written a new play.

136
00:10:12,024 --> 00:10:13,835
Oh.

137
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,045
Written a new play has he?

138
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:22,713
All those afternoons he was pretending to slope
off and roger his mistress like a decent chap,

139
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,756
he was lurking in his rooms,

140
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,315
poking away at a play.

141
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,537
That is disgusting, George.

142
00:10:29,572 --> 00:10:31,714
Disgusting and shameful.

143
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,996
What's it about, your play?

144
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,484
A satire on Dryden?

145
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,635
Pox o' Dryden. It's about you.

146
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:43,234
And in your play, do you tell the truth about me?

147
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,085
- Well, I've attempted to show you...
- Yes?

148
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,271
- Well, I enjoy your company.
- You've made me endearing.

149
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,836
- Well, only the public can...
- Don't smarm around, George.

150
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,593
You're an endearing sort of... chap.

151
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:59,595
So, you haven't told the truth.

152
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,445
Good.

153
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,630
We don't want to go frightening people.

154
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,657
Now, how about a real play?

155
00:11:09,692 --> 00:11:11,595
The Duke's have the new Otway.

156
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,315
Oh, I have high hopes of young Tom Otway.

157
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,957
Let me finish him off, sir.

158
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:27,988
This fellow is my servant. He has just filched
two shillings from my coat pocket.

159
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,872
A thief and a rogue.

160
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,792
My lord you express i

161
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,316
Haven't quite got the hang of the reign yet,
have you?

162
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,550
- I will not employ a thief.
- Then I will.

163
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,917
- How much was your master paying you?
- Six shillings a week, sir.

164
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:43,018
Who talks of thieving?

165
00:11:43,053 --> 00:11:44,885
George, give him £5.

166
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,549
Buy a brown livery and report to me
at the Duke's Theatre.

167
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:49,992
He will steal your gold.

168
00:11:50,027 --> 00:11:51,876
I hope so.

169
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,677
If he turned honest after coming into my orbit,
then I am not the malicious planet I had hoped.

170
00:11:56,712 --> 00:11:58,595
Now begone, sir.

171
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,356
- And er... how will your lordship be paying?
- Credit.

172
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,230
I only use coin vulgarised with the monarch's
head for transactions with servants.

173
00:12:16,265 --> 00:12:17,876
I am ever your humble servant.

174
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,457
No, Mr Ratcliffe,
you are the very prince of drapery.

175
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:24,704
The prince is always happy
to see the King's head.

176
00:12:24,739 --> 00:12:27,916
ROCHESTER:
But not to carry i around in his pocket

177
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,356
Credit then.

178
00:12:30,391 --> 00:12:32,196
Billy.

179
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,516
Join us.

180
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,429
Johnny.

181
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,107
This is Billy Downs

182
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,590
Billy this is the Earl of Rochester

183
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,156
How old are you, Mr Downs?

184
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,956
18, my lord.

185
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,350
Young man, you will die of this company.

186
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,918
Do not laugh. I'm serious.

187
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,792
Mr Ratcliffe, this hangs very well.

188
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,520
My lord, I saw you
just now with the gent's servant.

189
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,205
Did you think I dispensed wisely in the matter?

190
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,313
If the fool run off with the gold,
then you prove a point, but at your loss.

191
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:26,156
If he return in your livery, then you've gained
a servant who is a known cheat.

192
00:13:26,191 --> 00:13:28,837
So you prove a different point,
but again at your own expense.

193
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,085
You summarise well, Mr Downs.

194
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,680
And in such a manner,
I deduce you were trained

195
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,118
at one of the "count the angels on a pinhead"
Cambridge colleges.

196
00:13:39,153 --> 00:13:40,956
King's, was it not?

197
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,155
It was, my lord.

198
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,071
King's, yes.

199
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,275
And yet you do not draw
the moral of the incident.

200
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,516
Which is?

201
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,589
That any experiment of interest in life will be
carried out at your own expense. Mark it well.

202
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,236
MAN: My lord!

203
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:05,709
My Lord Rochester.

204
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,672
You've come back.

205
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,915
In your livery, my lord.

206
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,229
Then you are turned honest.
I cannot support that.

207
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,276
I regret the deed's honesty.

208
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,119
My lord.

209
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,709
But I considered that if I performed it
and fell into your service,

210
00:14:19,744 --> 00:14:22,671
I would have more... enjoyment of life.

211
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,519
You see, this fellow has the hang of the reign.

212
00:14:27,554 --> 00:14:30,118
I like this fellow exceedingly.
What is your name?

213
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,349
Alcock.

214
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,709
Like master, like servant.

215
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,280
Well, Alcock,

216
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:44,325
you shall drink and shag
more than any serving man in the kingdom.

217
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,717
Go at once and spend the rest of the money
on a whore, a large, greasy one.

218
00:14:48,752 --> 00:14:51,069
Then when you are done, return here to me.

219
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,036
Now begone.

220
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,916
MAN: Rochester!
WOMAN: Disgrace!

221
00:15:03,951 --> 00:15:06,074
MAN: Rochester!

222
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,238
Rochester! Missed you Lord Rochester!

223
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,076
He is risen!

224
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,805
My lord!

225
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,114
WOMAN: My lord!

226
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,236
MAN: Impertinent bastard!

227
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,635
MAN: Johnny!

228
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,194
My Lord Rochester!

229
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,755
Rochester you are a cunt sir!

230
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:46,715
WOMAN: I smell a rotten odour

231
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,275
I'll suck i for you Johnny
if you promise not to marry me!

232
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,799
WOMAN: Johnny said "cunt" to the King!

233
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,996
I'm going to brazen my arse at them.

234
00:16:16,031 --> 00:16:17,844
They've all seen it.

235
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:20,439
Well, they can bloody well put up with it again.

236
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:23,831
WOMAN: Johnny said "cunt" to the King!

237
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,005
ALL: Johnny said "cunt" to the King.

238
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,395
Johnny said "cunt" to the King!

239
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:34,397
My lord.

240
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,636
Dear Jane.

241
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,838
Give you your first London spurt of the summer.

242
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,513
- I brought the wife with me.
- Bit of a waste.

243
00:16:45,548 --> 00:16:47,829
Shooting good jism up the lawful.

244
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,870
Ladies and gallants all,

245
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,156
the King!

246
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,275
Oh, freeze my piss,
if the royal finger ain't beckoning me.

247
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,712
How exciting.

248
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,057
Did you miss me?

249
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:31,995
I missed the money.

250
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,916
Good.

251
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,316
Don't like a whore with sentiment.

252
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,993
I could have ignored your poem, Johnny,
but I made a fuss about it for a reason.

253
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,125
I won't hide anything from you.

254
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,870
The country's on the brink.
People are still reeling from the fire, the plague.

255
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,396
The Catholics are plotting
the Dutch are a bunch of bastards

256
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,552
and the French are ten times worse
and there's no money

257
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,965
I can only get funds by crawling to Parliament
or plotting against them.

258
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,039
And I don't want to lock antlers with them
head on in the way my father did.

259
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,515
"Head on?" That's quite good.

260
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,832
When you first came to court Johnny
you were a boy of 18

261
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,993
A certain flippancy a whiff of impertinence

262
00:18:46,028 --> 00:18:47,796
This was acceptable

263
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,471
But we're ten years down the road
and the view is different

264
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,965
The tone has to change.

265
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,719
I have to look responsible, sober.

266
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,592
I want you with me.

267
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:02,114
That's why I brought you back.

268
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,071
I want you to take on a new role.

269
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,913
Here? In the playhouse?

270
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,845
No, the House of Lords.

271
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,112
Your father spirited me out of England
when my life was at stake,

272
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,077
so I looked after him and after you.

273
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,839
- You put me in the Tower.
- And I let you out

274
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,230
The time has come for you to pay your dues.

275
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,316
People listen to you, Johnny.

276
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,789
If you took your seat in the Lords,
you could make great speeches

277
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,036
that would influence events.

278
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,285
Anyone can oppose.

279
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,205
It's fun to be against things.

280
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,869
But there comes a time when you have
to start being for things as well.

281
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,876
Your Majesty.

282
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,618
Mr Etherege.

283
00:20:03,653 --> 00:20:05,556
Take a nibble?

284
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,996
I've had my dinner, thank you, madam.

285
00:20:09,031 --> 00:20:10,791
George!

286
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:13,315
ACTRESS: Is this thy plighted faih?

287
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:15,213
Is this thy truth?

288
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:17,076
Oh too unkind!

289
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:19,669
False and unconstant youth!

290
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,477
- Madam, believe not but my brother's just.
ROCHESTER: Who's she?

291
00:20:24,512 --> 00:20:26,196
She's Lizzie Barry.

292
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,045
And she just won't do.

293
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,640
You wrong his honour by this mean distrust.

294
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,074
Well...

295
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,797
That does alleviate my griefs and give
my wearied soul a soft and kind reprieve.

296
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,671
Which ever to forget would be
as hard and as impossible as to reward.

297
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,830
Serving you my happiness secures.

298
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,234
Since equally with yours my hopes are crossed.

299
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,869
Of all but sorry and sad despair.

300
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,389
Lizzie. Lizzie!

301
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,125
On stage.

302
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,798
You must take your bow for the public.

303
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,913
Why do you persist in doing
the opposite of what you are told?

304
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,715
If girls like you do not do what they are told,
then it is all up with our sex on the stage.

305
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,712
You cannot ignore the advice
of them that know!

306
00:21:44,747 --> 00:21:46,113
Now, acknowledge your audience.

307
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,198
They can kiss my arse.

308
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,556
She's a good fuck, but she costs.

309
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,356
She gives a nice gobble,
but she won't do the full wibbly-wobbly.

310
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:06,156
- She does it with me.
- She does not!

311
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,509
Mary, if I may say so...

312
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,232
.. a statuesque performance.

313
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,833
Bursting with Grecian promise.

314
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:20,755
Mrs Barry, the work we did beforehand,
did it mean nothing to you?

315
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:22,556
That is correct, Mr Harris.

316
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,628
Molly, I cannot teach those
who will not be disposed to learn.

317
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,035
- Mr Etherege, how do you do, sir?
- Well, Mr Harris.

318
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,958
- Was not my Lord Rochester in wih you?
- Darted off

319
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,658
Did you care for the play?

320
00:22:33,693 --> 00:22:35,356
The play was well enough.

321
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:38,267
Most of the acting, too.

322
00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:50,715
Mrs Barry.

323
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,596
MOLLY: She has been dismissed.

324
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,925
I bring word from Mr Betterton.

325
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,316
- I've had such already.
- This is quite another.

326
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:08,737
You have obtained a reprieve for me.

327
00:23:08,772 --> 00:23:10,676
Yes, madam, but there is a price.

328
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,949
This is your first season on the London stage.

329
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,798
It is, my lord.

330
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:23,565
Mrs Barry,

331
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,149
you must acquire the trick
of ignoring those who do not like you.

332
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,719
In my experience, those who do not like you fall
into two categories, the stupid and the envious.

333
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,713
The stupid will like you in five years' time,
the envious never.

334
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,405
Wih my training you will become the best

335
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,398
the most fascinating actress
on the London stage

336
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,429
I shall come to the theatre tomorrow.

337
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,405
What are you up to, Johnny? She can't act.

338
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,477
She has neither the cadence of the heroic
nor the posture.

339
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:59,430
I will wager you 20 guineas she will become
the finest actress on our stage.

340
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,068
This is the prick talking, not the head.

341
00:24:02,103 --> 00:24:03,836
Knob her and have done.

342
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,525
Is it a wager?

343
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,835
My dear friend, you do not have 20 guineas.

344
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,365
Is it a wager?

345
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,391
We've missed the fuck. Can we get a drink?

346
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,030
There's a new toping house hard by
called Deaf Marion's.

347
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,476
The Cambridge boy knows his books by heart.

348
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,596
Lead on, King's.

349
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,036
Alcock.

350
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,232
My lord.

351
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,470
Something rotten has got into my guts.

352
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,031
I trust it's not me, my lord.

353
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,112
No, Alcock, it is not. Not yet.

354
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,799
We should mark the front lawn at Adderbury
for pall-mall.

355
00:24:47,834 --> 00:24:49,437
I had always thought it a foolish game.

356
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,232
Depends on who you play with.

357
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,233
The King plays with a common prostitute,
not his wife.

358
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:57,430
The Portuguese
have little flair for outdoor pursuits.

359
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,870
Except navigating, of course.

360
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:02,394
I mean that the etiquette of it is singular.

361
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,285
I know what you mean.

362
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,880
You must always be
ace, king and jack, my dear.

363
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,555
But heaven has not disposed your cards so.

364
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,517
ETHEREGE: Johnny! It's your shot!

365
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:14,165
I'm not playing!

366
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,536
Oh, but you are, John.

367
00:25:16,571 --> 00:25:18,873
You are if I say you are.

368
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,565
The most advanced scientific instrument
in western Europe.

369
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:34,116
It cost £60000
It tells the time in every corner of the globe

370
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,276
Understand?

371
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,525
That is achievement.

372
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:43,599
The man who did that was not continually pissed
for the last three years.

373
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,835
What do you want from me?

374
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:51,237
Writing something profound
that will stand as a monument to my reign.

375
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,556
You're my literary giant.

376
00:25:53,591 --> 00:25:55,405
Dryden? Plodder.

377
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,236
But look what he's achieved.

378
00:25:57,271 --> 00:25:59,032
Elizabeth had her Shakespeare.

379
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,235
You can be mine.

380
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:05,512
Give me a major work of literature
and I'll give you 500 guineas.

381
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,834
When would you like it? Friday?

382
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,196
Don't fuck it up, John.

383
00:26:12,231 --> 00:26:14,116
I love you.

384
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,116
Mrs Barry!

385
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,358
I cannot let you have long.
I must prepare Tamburlaine.

386
00:26:30,393 --> 00:26:32,116
There's a great deal of setting up

387
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,484
Mrs Barry.

388
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:35,475
.. and a deal of taking down.

389
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:40,525
My Lord Rochester.

390
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,391
I'm come as I said I would.

391
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,356
Will you have me lift my skirt?

392
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,031
Or do you have a mind
to raise it by your own endeavours?

393
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,476
I'm come to train you... in your acting.

394
00:26:52,511 --> 00:26:54,038
So you said when we first met,

395
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:57,588
but your reputation being what it is,
I thought you meant something different.

396
00:26:57,759 --> 00:26:59,715
I have, I hope, many reputations.

397
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,155
I am come, I say, to train you...

398
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:04,394
in your stage acting

399
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:07,605
Never in my life
have I heard you spoken of as an actor.

400
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,791
That does not deter me
from spreading my insights to others

401
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,833
- I thought it would not.
- Then we shall begin

402
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,484
You are familiar with the plays of Mr Etherege?

403
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:20,113
- There are but two my lord
- Not for long, I fear.

404
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,755
The Comical Revenge or Love In A Tub

405
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,633
Have you seen Mrs Betterton playing Graciana?

406
00:27:25,668 --> 00:27:27,278
Yes, I'm her understudy.

407
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,235
Indeed.

408
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,577
Act Two, Scene Two.

409
00:27:31,612 --> 00:27:33,594
I shall play Beaufort.

410
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,711
Graciana, why do you condemn your love?

411
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,509
Your beauty without that, alas,
would prove but my destruction.

412
00:27:39,544 --> 00:27:43,392
An unlucky star
prognosticating ruin and despair.

413
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,125
You mistake.

414
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:48,118
'Tis not my love I blame, but my discretion.

415
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:51,955
Here the active flame should yet
a longer time have been concealed.

416
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:54,852
Too soon too soon I fear i was revealed

417
00:27:54,887 --> 00:27:57,714
Our weaker sex glories in surprise.

418
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,673
We boast the sudden conquests of our eyes.

419
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,685
But men esteem a foe that dares contend

420
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,805
One that with noble courage
does defend a wounded heart.

421
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,469
The victories they gain, they prize
by their own hazard and their pain.

422
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,597
That was not Elizabeth Barry.
That was Mrs Betterton.

423
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,645
LIZZIE: An understudy must imiate not create

424
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,114
- Yesterday you created
- Yesterday I was dismissed.

425
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,711
- But you played truthfully
- It costs too much to play the truth.

426
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,195
I do not think
you have considered this speech at all

427
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,196
Well, how would you have me do it?

428
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,516
Let us consider now.

429
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,765
What does it mean, that speech
that Mrs Betterton mangled so?

430
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:39,952
Graciana means that she has given away
the secrets of her heart too freely.

431
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,913
Something that a gentlewoman
must not do to a gentleman.

432
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,395
- Why not?
- Because men will take love for granted

433
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,793
and then not prize it.

434
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,205
And is our author right? Do you believe that?

435
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,312
I believe men are hurdles
that must be negotiated.

436
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,273
Is that all? Do you never feel passion for us?

437
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,075
I've counterfeited passion in gentlemen's beds
if that is your meaning.

438
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:02,274
Counterfei will not serve you on the stage

439
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,598
Yesterday I was jeered and taunted
by 400 ruffians.

440
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,352
I know that will not serve me.

441
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:11,432
And so you will take their word against both
of ours and traffic in falsehood from now on?

442
00:29:11,467 --> 00:29:13,205
I don't know

443
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,754
Then let us gain knowledge.
To the speech again.

444
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,125
You played i sweetly

445
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:23,039
Graciana is not innocent
or she would not have such insight

446
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,805
If you had ever loved a man

447
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,217
you would say that speech wih regret

448
00:29:29,252 --> 00:29:31,595
Because you would fear the loss of him.

449
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,596
And supposing I have loved?

450
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,956
Then show me in the speech.

451
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,313
Sir, you mistake.

452
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,958
'Tis not my love I blame.

453
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,125
But my discretion.

454
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:50,312
Here the active flame should yet
a longer time have been concealed.

455
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,325
Too soon, too soon I fear it was revealed.

456
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,956
Our weaker sex glories in surprise.
We boast the sudden conquests of our eyes.

457
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,993
But men esteem a foe that dares contend.

458
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,311
One that with noble courage
does defend a wounded heart.

459
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,399
The victories they gain, they prize
by their own hazard and their pain.

460
00:30:08,434 --> 00:30:10,236
Well?

461
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,432
Was there improvement?

462
00:30:12,467 --> 00:30:13,872
Did you think so?

463
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,996
I wish to know your thoughts.

464
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,478
It was better.

465
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:22,165
But now you're too angry.

466
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,875
Of course I'm fucking angry! You walk
into this theatre in your 30-shilling boots

467
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,157
telling me how I should set about my work!
I warn you, I have a temper.

468
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,238
And I have been known to strike out
with the first object at hand.

469
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:36,598
If that be a property blade, some have
sharper edges than is needful, so have a care.

470
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,556
Ahhh.

471
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:41,432
To die onstage
at the hands of a beautiful woman.

472
00:30:41,467 --> 00:30:43,116
I am no such!

473
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,834
I think I can make you an actress of truth,
not a creature of artifice.

474
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,724
I can do this.

475
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:53,990
But I cannot train you
unless you give a little towards me.

476
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,436
It's not in my nature to give.

477
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,245
I have my talent and I'm jealous of it.

478
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,637
And though I give you credit that you
and you alone in all the town have seen it,

479
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,278
I am not so dazzled by the lord and master
in you that I cannot resent you.

480
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,398
Yes.

481
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:16,165
You are right.

482
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,749
I am intent on doing something
that no other has yet done.

483
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,918
And I lost my purpose yesterday
with fear of the pit.

484
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,805
But I will conquer them.

485
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:28,435
And it shall not be said
when I have my fame and my £2 a week

486
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:32,798
that Lord Rochester took to me and touched me
with the shining wing of his genius

487
00:31:32,833 --> 00:31:35,750
and so turned me
into a little corner of his greatness. No!

488
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,634
I shall be valued for me
and for what I knew I could do upon this stage!

489
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,759
And for what I, Lizzie Barry... how I...
I took the heat of my own soul and moulded it

490
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,873
and turned it into a wondrous thing
and so triumphed.

491
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,316
If I can help you to that triumph,

492
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:55,037
I'm not so devoted to the trumpeting of
my own works that I would wish to take credit.

493
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,638
So you say now.

494
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:01,565
But in the ale house, when the play is done,
and the talk is of my Cleopatra,

495
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,639
will you not glide towards your cronies
with a "I taught her that piece of business"

496
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,799
or "She could not be heard in the gallery
until I instructed her in a trick or two"?

497
00:32:09,834 --> 00:32:11,511
Madam I offer my services

498
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:15,917
If you see no advantage in them,
they can as easy be withdrawn.

499
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:18,953
You could buy my slit for a pound a night, sir.

500
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,845
I would not mind that.

501
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,314
But I think you would not have it so.

502
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:29,313
What I think you want is power over me,
which I do bridle at.

503
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,994
For it is only I who can do what you say I can do.

504
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,236
If you wish to play a part in this
I would strongly know why

505
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,714
Ask yourself what you want from the theatre.

506
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,525
I want the passionate love of my audience

507
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,916
I want when I make a sweep of my arm
to carry their hearts away.

508
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,756
And for when I die, for them
to sigh for never seeing me again.

509
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,909
Till the next afternoon.

510
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,076
There is your answer.

511
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,912
I want to be one of that multitude.

512
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,236
I wish to be moved.

513
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,525
I cannot feel in life.

514
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,711
I must have others do it
for me here in the theatre.

515
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,832
You are spoken of as a man
with a stomach for life.

516
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:16,360
I am the cynic of our golden age.

517
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,630
This bounteous dish,
which our great Charles and our great God

518
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,438
have, more or less in equal measure, placed
before us, sets my teeth permanently on edge.

519
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,709
Life has no purpose.
It is everywhere undone by arbitrariness.

520
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,718
I do this and it matters not a jot
if I do the opposite.

521
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,636
But in a playhouse,

522
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,885
every action, good or bad,
has its consequences.

523
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,037
Drop a handkerchief
and it will return to smother you.

524
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,685
The theatre is my drug.

525
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,192
And my illness is so far advanced
that my physic must be of the highest quality.

526
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,836
Oh, my lord,

527
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,233
on those conditions,
I endeavour to do what you want.

528
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:14,596
What I want is that we meet again tomorrow
to consider Ophelia.

529
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,676
Ophelia?

530
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,958
Mr Betterton will revive Hamlet next month
and you will play Ophelia.

531
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,796
Ophelia then if you wish.

532
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,590
But let us not neglect
the lesson in Mr Etherege's speech.

533
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:32,995
And what is that?

534
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:37,276
That women
should ever view men with suspicion.

535
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,725
I shall be happy to return and address our work

536
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,151
with that instruction
written on the inside of my skull.

537
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,591
- Do me now.
JANE: How?

538
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,836
Mouth.

539
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,938
Trembling,

540
00:35:18,973 --> 00:35:20,876
confused,

541
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,756
despairing, limber,

542
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,952
dry,

543
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:28,831
A wishing, weak,

544
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,436
unmoving lump I lie.

545
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,032
This...

546
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:38,912
.. dart of love,

547
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:41,035
whose piercing point, oft tried,

548
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:45,157
With virgin blood 10,000 maids have dyed,

549
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,594
Now languid lies in this unhappy hour.

550
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:53,515
Shrunk up...

551
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,325
.. and sapless,

552
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,396
like a withered flower.

553
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,878
I have a feeling this is going nowhere

554
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,236
I have that feeling, too.

555
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,116
I've met this woman.

556
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:11,189
Lizzie Barry

557
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,276
That new actress?

558
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,845
- She ain't no looker
- There is spirit in her.

559
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,917
When a gent sees the spirit
and not the eyes or the tits,

560
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,035
then a gent is in trouble

561
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,765
Would you call me a cynic, Jane?

562
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,237
I'd call you a man who pretends
to like life more than he does.

563
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,152
Is that a cynic?

564
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,880
I'm just a moll-sack I don't do questions

565
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:43,035
If I am a cynic,

566
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:49,557
how have I fallen in love with a plain woman,
whom I do not know?

567
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,605
You saw her on stage.

568
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:55,030
All the colours and them poems they say.

569
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,277
Gives them a glow

570
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,999
- You've seen her out of the theatre?
- No.

571
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,276
Well, then it's not her. It's the theatre.

572
00:37:03,311 --> 00:37:05,116
That or

573
00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:07,916
Or what?

574
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,756
They say men fall three times.

575
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,044
First is calf love.

576
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,115
Second is the one you marry.

577
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,876
And third?

578
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,878
Third

579
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,636
Third is your deathbed bride.

580
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:31,312
You sniff her, you sniff your own shroud.

581
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,325
Ah.

582
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,669
How you have cheered me.

583
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,084
Go home and sleep.

584
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,599
- I don't want to sleep.
- Then go home and think.

585
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:44,079
- I don't ever want to think again.
- John.

586
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,285
Don't make me care for you.

587
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,677
I'd rather you came your fetch over my face
than leave me with that,

588
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,555
a lump of caring.

589
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,836
Now go home and forget.

590
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,350
ROCHESTER:
Much wine had passed wih grave discourse

591
00:38:14,385 --> 00:38:16,798
Of who fucks who and who does worse

592
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:23,497
When I who still take care to see
Drunkenness relieved by lechery

593
00:38:23,532 --> 00:38:28,674
Went out into St James's Park
To cool my head and fire my heart

594
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:35,392
But though St James has the honour on't
'Tis consecrate to prick and cunt

595
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:43,312
There by a most incestuous birth
Strange woods spring from the teeming earth

596
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:53,753
And nightly now beneath their shade
Are buggeries rapes and incests made

597
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,075
Mr Huysmans.

598
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,837
Perhaps a bottle and a glass would be
handsome adornments to your composition?

599
00:39:52,872 --> 00:39:56,349
They are not appropriate objects
in a family portrait, my lord.

600
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,125
Mr Huysmans, here is another thought.

601
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,720
You see that monkey yonder
dancing to the fiddle?

602
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:14,315
Can't help but notice
how human these creatures are

603
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,148
I would sit that monkey
on a pile of solemn volumes,

604
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:24,435
and place in her hand a scrap of paper as if
it were a poem she'd just written, do you see?

605
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:31,955
And while she is offering the poem to me,
I am crowning her with the bays.

606
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:38,157
I find Lady Rochester
a more elegant and interesting subject.

607
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,605
You are wide of the point, sir.

608
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,757
Elegance, interest, all very well in their way.

609
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,718
But what do they illuminate?

610
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,268
Am I not then an apt partner for you to sit with?

611
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,405
You are apt, Elizabeth. You are very apt.

612
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,510
But you would rather be painted with a monkey?

613
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,995
It is of a muchness.

614
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,152
You are both apt in your different ways.

615
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:03,035
In this portrait I am no better than a monkey
who knows the names of his ancestors.

616
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,509
And I?

617
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,231
A gaudy female monkey,
gloating over the opulence of your cage.

618
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:23,676
I love London.

619
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:27,159
Everyone catches its generous spirit so quickly.

620
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,232
Indeed.

621
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,716
I do not mean to upset people, Alcock,
but I have to speak my mind,

622
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,109
because what is in my mind
is always more interesting

623
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,918
than what is happening
in the world outside my mind.

624
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,753
Makes you impossible to live with, though,
do you see?

625
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,595
Did I once praise you for your blunt manner?

626
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:50,954
It was your reason for employing me.

627
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,629
It could as easy be your grounds for dismissal.

628
00:41:56,664 --> 00:41:59,795
Now, get me the monkey.

629
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,716
John.

630
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,999
John, I could bear our marriage more easily
if there were no pretence.

631
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,350
If I were merely a housekeeper
and a conduit for the noble line.

632
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:38,559
But when you're away you write
so beguilingly of how you love me and...

633
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,325
.. I do not think you mean to torture me,

634
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,033
but it is a torture
to be informed of passion from a distance

635
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,276
and then in the flesh to be so reviled.

636
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:52,174
You know I always mean to be well
when we are together,

637
00:42:52,209 --> 00:42:55,270
but after a few weeks, I find I have no gift for it.

638
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,955
In my mind I am somewhere else.

639
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:03,157
Then cut me out of your heart completely
and have done.

640
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,233
Do not command me to do something
beyond my power.

641
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,857
Is the fault mine? If I were a better wife...

642
00:43:09,892 --> 00:43:12,395
would you not need
the whorehouse and the inn?

643
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:14,954
Every man needs the whorehouse and the inn.

644
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:20,317
But it's not the inn or a whore that I see
in your eyes. It's some other creature.

645
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,676
The playhouse.

646
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,436
An actress.

647
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:34,949
And when your eyes shone the other day,
they were shining for her.

648
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:39,515
They were.

649
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,869
I see I am more of an obstacle
to your London life than I supposed.

650
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:51,035
I'll be gone by the morning.

651
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,436
My lord.

652
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,156
How is Ophelia in this scene?

653
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:17,874
Well, she's mad. She's out of her wits.

654
00:44:17,909 --> 00:44:20,190
There are many ways to be out of your wits.

655
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,878
Yes.

656
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,196
Well, there's grief.

657
00:44:25,231 --> 00:44:27,133
And drink.

658
00:44:27,168 --> 00:44:29,062
And love.

659
00:44:29,097 --> 00:44:30,956
So I hear.

660
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,756
These different states,
how would you show them?

661
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,716
Show them?

662
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,596
Their physical manifestation.

663
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,638
Close your eyes.

664
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,196
Close your eyes.

665
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,633
LIZZIE:
O what a noble mind is here o'erthrown

666
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,355
The courtier's soldier's scholar's
eye tongue sword and I

667
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:24,952
Again.

668
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,190
O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown.

669
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,953
- The courtier's, soldier's...
- Again.

670
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:36,797
O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown.
The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye...

671
00:45:36,832 --> 00:45:38,113
Again.

672
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,430
- Eye tongue sword
- Again!

673
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,631
- O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown.
ECHO: is here o'erthrown

674
00:45:43,666 --> 00:45:45,470
The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's...

675
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,436
- Again.
- What was wrong?

676
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:50,245
You know what was wrong. Again.

677
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,272
She has done this speech
20 times this afternoon.

678
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:55,271
And she will do it 20 more.

679
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:58,716
MOLLY: No-one has worked like this
in the history of the theatre

680
00:45:58,751 --> 00:46:01,870
- Exactly.
- O what a noble mind is here o'erthrown

681
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,272
The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's,
eye, tongue, sword...

682
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,365
and I

683
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,470
of ladies most deject and wretched

684
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,078
that sucked the honey of his music vows

685
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,239
O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown.

686
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:20,445
The courtier's,

687
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,436
soldier's, scholar's,

688
00:47:22,471 --> 00:47:24,356
eye, tongue,

689
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,756
sword,

690
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,565
and I,

691
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,558
of ladies most deject and wretched

692
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,154
that sucked the honey of his music vows

693
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:42,636
O, woe is me.

694
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,956
To see what I have seen.

695
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,316
O, see what I see.

696
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:54,630
And there's some fennel for you
and columbine.

697
00:47:54,665 --> 00:47:56,556
And there's rue for you.

698
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,836
And here's some for me.

699
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:08,914
We may call it herb of grace o' Sundays.

700
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:20,716
O, you must wear your rue with a difference.

701
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,276
LIZZIE: He is gone

702
00:48:27,311 --> 00:48:29,196
He is gone

703
00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:33,445
And we...

704
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,277
cast away, moan.

705
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,316
God have mercy on his soul

706
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,354
And of all ye Christian souls

707
00:48:42,389 --> 00:48:44,509
No-one likes a clever bastard.

708
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,916
I pray God

709
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,276
God be wi' ye

710
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:18,837
Well, Lizzie, my congratulations.

711
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:22,709
Thank you, Mr Harris.

712
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,995
Will you take the air with me?

713
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:30,916
I was thinking...

714
00:49:30,951 --> 00:49:32,836
a drink.

715
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,433
Lord Rochester left at the curtain.

716
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,396
Then I shall take the air alone.

717
00:49:43,431 --> 00:49:45,590
Good night.

718
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,716
Go on!

719
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,556
My lord.

720
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,315
Hurry!

721
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:16,679
Argh!

722
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,033
John.

723
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,076
Madam, this driveway will not do.

724
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:37,405
Good afternoon, my lord.

725
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,325
You sent no warning of your arrival.

726
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,193
The road is not functional
and the grounds are a swamp.

727
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:46,472
If you were here more often,
you'd know that Oxfordshire is not a dry county.

728
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:53,156
It is a good thing that John devote himself
to the House. I will not hear him reproved for it.

729
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:57,472
lunderstood that he was devoting himself
to an engagement in the theatre.

730
00:50:57,559 --> 00:51:01,108
That would not be appropriate
for a man of breeding.

731
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:15,791
Anyone can drink.

732
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:19,395
Only a few can match my determination.

733
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:24,236
We who are nobility
rise above the calls of the flesh.

734
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:26,325
It is true.

735
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:29,193
We have our strength of will, do we not?

736
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,037
I hope we do.

737
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,436
But supposing we are perverse,

738
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:41,397
and use our will to bad ends?

739
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:44,314
Then we search deep inside ourselves,

740
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:48,951
and we tear out the evil.

741
00:51:58,519 --> 00:52:00,555
Tear deeper, Mother.

742
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,596
ROCHESTER: Lizzie Barry!

743
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,436
Lizzie Barry!

744
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,636
Lizzie Barry!

745
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,550
I ran away from your love
and now I run towards i

746
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,675
Test my love in any way you see fi!

747
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,796
Test me!

748
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:46,148
I will not fail!

749
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,632
15.

750
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:46,795
Get back some of the money I lost
on Lizzie "Horseface" Barry.

751
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:49,598
Yes, how is that little caper going, Johnny?

752
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,796
I hear she charges by the minute.

753
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,799
Come on, Johnny. All gentlemen together.

754
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,916
You're not a gentleman, George.

755
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:06,116
You were trained as a lawyer.
And you write plays for money.

756
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:10,830
Oh, yes. And what about your commission
from the King? Does that not count?

757
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,752
That is quite different.

758
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,756
"Different"? Of course.

759
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:19,676
May one enquire
how the great work progresses?

760
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:22,285
Written the first line yet?

761
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:28,236
I, at least, do not plagiarise the wit of my friends
and pass it off as my own.

762
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:29,919
Come on, Johnny, be fair.

763
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,637
Sit!

764
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:50,016
What was the wager?

765
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,809
The wager was 15 guineas.

766
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:58,769
My Lord, the actress Elizabeth Barry's outside.

767
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:01,016
She will wait.

768
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:04,135
She's very insistent.

769
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:06,495
She is a whore and she will wait!

770
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:22,145
It's a made hand!

771
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:24,410
I was not good in the play this afternoon.

772
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:26,536
I craved reassurance.

773
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:29,416
All I could think about was you.

774
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:36,496
You see, that is where there is still
imbalance between us.

775
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:39,811
Because you demand
so much of me and so little of yourself.

776
00:55:41,859 --> 00:55:44,817
You took my small gift and polished it
until it shone.

777
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:48,899
Yet your own great gift you just throw away.

778
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:53,345
There.

779
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:55,336
You see? I went too far.

780
00:55:56,260 --> 00:56:00,253
A trait which in you is fascinating,
but in me is a fault.

781
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:24,292
"And wit was his vain, frivolous pretence,

782
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:27,617
of pleasing others at his own expense. "

783
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:37,096
Lizzie Barry.

784
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,256
Read me some more.

785
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:11,651
I keep coming back to the French

786
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:15,130
- There they are, the envy of Europe.
- They keep a nice class of brothel.

787
00:58:15,165 --> 00:58:17,933
Of course. They're a bunch of cunts.
That's not the point.

788
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:22,451
Ineed money and they can provide it, and
I won't hide it from you, Johnny, things are bad.

789
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:25,699
I can't get money out of Louis
unless I dissolve Parliament

790
00:58:25,734 --> 00:58:28,618
and I can't get money out of Parliament
unless I fight Louis.

791
00:58:28,653 --> 00:58:30,496
Well, choose.

792
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:32,877
Ineed money from both of them.

793
00:58:32,912 --> 00:58:34,745
You spoke of a big challenge.

794
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:37,658
Louis's sent in a new ambassador.
Cultivated type.

795
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:39,616
Here's my plan.

796
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:43,018
Your great work,
we stage it to welcome him to London.

797
00:58:43,053 --> 00:58:44,824
Big gesture of friendship.

798
00:58:44,859 --> 00:58:46,929
And we show we're better than they are.

799
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:50,218
A spectacle with some really profound writing.

800
00:58:50,253 --> 00:58:51,778
You're the man for it.

801
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:53,945
Will you do it for me?

802
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:57,131
At Betterton's next spring
when the season's finished.

803
00:58:57,339 --> 00:58:59,225
You're desperate.

804
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:02,696
What we need to celebrate is life itself.

805
00:59:02,731 --> 00:59:06,133
Well, I'm obviously the man for that.

806
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:09,611
Good. I'll send Chiffinch
to talk to you about the money.

807
00:59:09,819 --> 00:59:12,572
Costumes, settings, something really splendid.

808
00:59:12,607 --> 00:59:14,176
Splendid, yes.

809
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:16,576
And unusual.

810
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,456
There, John.

811
00:59:19,491 --> 00:59:21,376
Fruit.

812
00:59:21,819 --> 00:59:24,777
Fruit from South America... growing here.

813
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:27,545
Dazzles the mind.

814
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:30,856
Do you see what can be done
with knowledge and application?

815
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:45,293
"I eat to swive and swive to eat again."

816
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:54,158
Ink! Ink!

817
00:59:54,193 --> 00:59:56,096
Bring me ink!

818
01:00:02,300 --> 01:00:04,939
Not "drink", lump. Ink!

819
01:00:06,339 --> 01:00:09,251
Alcock, did I not leave you in the country?

820
01:00:09,286 --> 01:00:11,176
I walked back, my lord.

821
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:18,558
Back again?

822
01:00:18,593 --> 01:00:20,425
Back again.

823
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:22,416
Sceptres bear. Fear.

824
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:40,209
I'm worried. This French business
couldn't be more important.

825
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,256
What's he doing?

826
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,025
He's writing.

827
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:49,814
- For the first time since I've known him
- But what?

828
01:00:51,339 --> 01:00:53,277
Sublime thoughts.

829
01:00:53,312 --> 01:00:55,216
Philosophy in verse.

830
01:00:56,140 --> 01:00:58,370
I believe he is on the verge of greatness.

831
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:01,456
You've read some?

832
01:01:02,380 --> 01:01:04,416
He shares everything with me.

833
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:09,616
You should wear more jewellery.

834
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:13,054
LIZZIE: I cannot provide for i on my wages

835
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:15,454
CHARLES ll: Does not the Earl provide?

836
01:01:15,489 --> 01:01:17,489
The Earl is not one of life's providers.

837
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:19,545
But the King is.

838
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:22,140
If you want the best, you may receive it from me.

839
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:27,135
I shall be everything you wish me to be.

840
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:31,219
I wish you to be my eyes and ears
on his earlship.

841
01:01:32,060 --> 01:01:34,016
I am his lover.

842
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:37,376
But I am your true subject.

843
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:40,736
Then you'll serve me in this matter?

844
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:44,576
Yes, I will.

845
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:50,412
And we shall both... profit.

846
01:02:55,780 --> 01:03:00,615
Does the writing of the play go well, my lord?

847
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:06,539
Alcock, try not to be a cunt.

848
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:09,734
We will do this until you get it right.

849
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:12,696
My lord, Alice Twooney has sent word.

850
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:15,130
Her child is sick and she shan't come.

851
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:17,851
What was to be her role?

852
01:03:18,339 --> 01:03:21,536
- She was playing little Clytoris.
- Of course

853
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:23,499
Alcock!

854
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:29,418
- This is your moment. You will stand in for her.
- No, my lord.

855
01:03:29,453 --> 01:03:31,807
- I beg your pardon.
- I'm Alcock.

856
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:34,370
Little Clytoris is beyond my range.

857
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:37,218
Molly.

858
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:40,213
I am not a visible person.

859
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:42,536
Do not cross me.

860
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:49,220
Madam, your dildos
are not to compare with what I've seen.

861
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:51,336
Indeed, they're paltry ware.

862
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:55,138
Short dildos leave the pleasure half undone.

863
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:57,290
I'm sorry, my lord, I do have a question.

864
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:04,018
Are you sure this entertainment will be fitting
for both the occasion and the company?

865
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:08,905
Molly, the entire piece has been devised
with the French in mind.

866
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:13,650
In Paris, fornication in the streets
with total strangers is compulsory.

867
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:18,056
Oh, beg pardon, my lord,
my most southerly venture is Epsom.

868
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:19,945
HARRIS: My lord!

869
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:21,732
I asked for no interruptions.

870
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,784
My suit is one of the utmost urgency.

871
01:04:23,819 --> 01:04:26,856
The stage direction
at the end of this scene requires,

872
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:29,819
in my opinion, some authorial exposition.

873
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:32,016
It seems straightforward enough.

874
01:04:32,051 --> 01:04:33,811
Yes. Um...

875
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:36,619
"Then dance six naked men and women,

876
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:40,250
the men doing obedience to the women's cunts,

877
01:04:40,285 --> 01:04:42,025
kissing and touching them often.

878
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:44,938
The women in like manner to the men's pricks,

879
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:48,014
kissing and dandling their cods,

880
01:04:48,049 --> 01:04:49,705
and then fall to fucking,

881
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:53,938
after which the women sigh
and the men look simple, and so sneak off. "

882
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:57,295
The end of the second act

883
01:04:57,420 --> 01:04:59,172
A strong scene.

884
01:04:59,339 --> 01:05:03,173
An eminently playable scene,
and, though I say it myself, a climactic one.

885
01:05:04,060 --> 01:05:07,416
And will the kind of equipment
that young lady has in her hand

886
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:09,856
be available to gentlemen for...

887
01:05:11,260 --> 01:05:15,139
.. strapping around the middle
for the execution of this scene?

888
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:18,415
I had not envisaged you to be so encumbered.

889
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:24,396
I feel the scene should be given... in the flesh.

890
01:05:24,431 --> 01:05:28,892
And will we give... two performances on the day?

891
01:05:29,060 --> 01:05:30,665
No, Mr Harris.

892
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:33,737
Oh, I am glad to hear that from the author.

893
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:38,376
With the dress rehearsal, the court performance
and the public showing, I envisage three.

894
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:42,811
Right. I don't know if you've met
my regular understudy, Mr Lightman.

895
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:45,025
He's a most dependable fellow.

896
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:47,733
Sir, you have the honour
of playing my understudy.

897
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:52,456
Well, I shall take this opportunity
to withdraw from the engagement.

898
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:56,168
You are one of life's understudies!

899
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:12,258
If tonight goes wrong,
we'll be at war within a week.

900
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:18,328
Have faith.

901
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:22,573
Whatever else may go wrong,
your words will command admiration.

902
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:26,496
They always do.

903
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:31,897
Lizzie. You're looking pale.

904
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:35,734
Molly, work the magic of your art on Mrs Barry.

905
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:47,696
There's the French ambassador.

906
01:06:55,020 --> 01:06:56,772
No. Makes me weepy.

907
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:13,739
I weep, but from a different end.

908
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:54,055
Very good, this Italian workmanship.

909
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:57,625
People pay more for quality.

910
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:05,016
I'd like to meet the man who wrote this.

911
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:24,779
Thus in the zenith of my lust I reign.

912
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:28,415
I eat to swive and swive to eat again.

913
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:33,614
Let other monarchs who their sceptres bear
to keep their subjects less in love than fear

914
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:35,985
be slaves to crowns

915
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:39,899
My nation shall be free.
My pintle only shall my sceptre be.

916
01:09:41,339 --> 01:09:43,807
My laws shall act more pleasure than command

917
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:48,657
and with my prick, I'll govern all the land.

918
01:09:48,692 --> 01:09:50,530
Chas, tell me this ain't happening.

919
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:54,215
He's gonna get his prick out any second.
I can feel it in my water.

920
01:09:54,339 --> 01:09:58,412
It's very amusing, because in France
he would be executed for this.

921
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:02,699
ROCHESTER: The King commands all men
from humid cunt to humane arsonist

922
01:10:02,734 --> 01:10:05,616
Buggery we choose and buggery we'll allow

923
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:10,490
I do proclaim the manly arse so firm
shall be the sole recipient

924
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:12,065
of sperm!

925
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:15,854
CHARLES ll:
Lord Rochester, this portrayal of yours...

926
01:10:17,220 --> 01:10:19,859
.. would it be based on a particular monarch?

927
01:10:19,894 --> 01:10:21,690
No, Your Highness.

928
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:27,333
My character is far too fantastic a creation
ever to have drawn breath.

929
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:30,498
Now resume your seat.
You're intruding on my stage.

930
01:10:30,533 --> 01:10:32,335
No, you're intruding on mine.

931
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:38,014
I hand you a chance to show your shining talent
and what do you give me in return?

932
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:43,652
A pornographic representation of a royal court
where the men deal only in buggery

933
01:10:43,860 --> 01:10:47,899
and the women's sole object of interest
is the dildo!

934
01:10:47,934 --> 01:10:50,089
A monument to your reign.

935
01:10:51,459 --> 01:10:52,687
Johnny!

936
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:10,853
CHARLES ll:
Disappear? People don't disappear.

937
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:16,652
Monsieur Barrillon.

938
01:11:16,820 --> 01:11:22,178
Your Majesty, it is with regret that I must
make my return to France tout de suite.

939
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:42,576
I hate racing.

940
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:45,215
The sport of kings? The sport of peasants!

941
01:11:45,339 --> 01:11:48,137
Come on, Georgie. You like it when you win.

942
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:51,849
I must have seen the backside of £60 today.

943
01:11:51,884 --> 01:11:53,536
I could have bought a horse.

944
01:11:53,980 --> 01:11:58,531
Vanishing Spark. Why did you let me
bet on a horse called Vanishing Spark?

945
01:11:58,566 --> 01:11:59,813
What the fuck?

946
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:02,932
Johnny?

947
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:05,293
Gents

948
01:12:05,459 --> 01:12:08,212
spare a drink for a couple of chums?

949
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:10,248
Where've you been?

950
01:12:10,459 --> 01:12:13,337
Our show was such a success in the capital,

951
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:17,849
we had to undertake
an extensive tour of the provinces.

952
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:22,452
Now, where's the fucking drink?

953
01:12:22,459 --> 01:12:24,893
Come on, Charlie, get out your winnings.

954
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:28,098
CHARLIE: This is i gentlemen!

955
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:33,538
This is the residence of the whore
personally recommended by Mr Dryden himself,

956
01:12:33,573 --> 01:12:35,609
who glories in the name of Molly Noakes

957
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:37,705
Well, what are we waiting for?

958
01:12:37,740 --> 01:12:40,538
- Open up, keepers of the gate!
- Molly!

959
01:12:40,620 --> 01:12:42,451
Molly!

960
01:12:42,539 --> 01:12:44,424
- Molly...
- Molly!

961
01:12:44,459 --> 01:12:46,734
- Gentlemen?
ROCHESTER: Where's Molly?

962
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:49,135
DOWNS: We want Molly and we want her fast.

963
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:52,616
Young man, you are pissing on my top boots.

964
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:55,578
Yes, fellow.
But you are a whorehouse doorstep man

965
01:12:55,980 --> 01:12:58,130
and we are the cream of the country.

966
01:12:59,339 --> 01:13:01,295
I am Constable of the Watch.

967
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:04,975
Dryden can't even write a shag map.

968
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:07,819
You, sir, are a rogue and a liar.

969
01:13:08,459 --> 01:13:10,256
Murder!

970
01:13:10,379 --> 01:13:11,414
Help!

971
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:25,169
Now, then, gentlemen...

972
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:30,452
I do believe there's been
a small species of error.

973
01:13:30,539 --> 01:13:32,814
We are Johnny! Johnny!

974
01:13:32,940 --> 01:13:34,498
Johnny!

975
01:13:34,780 --> 01:13:36,338
No!

976
01:13:38,140 --> 01:13:38,777
Argh!

977
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:40,729
Argh!

978
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:43,170
My eyes!

979
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:08,056
Johnny, please...

980
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:14,776
Johnny!

981
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:29,656
I told you.

982
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:35,896
CHARLES ll: It's been six months

983
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:39,493
Where the fuck is he?

984
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:41,053
Find him

985
01:14:41,140 --> 01:14:42,289
Your Majesty.

986
01:14:55,539 --> 01:14:58,178
ROCHESTER:
I find myself at the gates of death

987
01:14:58,419 --> 01:15:00,887
almost blind and utterly lame

988
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:05,011
Scarce wih the reasonable hope
of ever seeing you again

989
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:09,456
Wih my sickness
i seems the world has turned hateful of me

990
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:15,572
But I will rise again to right this injustice
and take back your heart

991
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:22,778
The mercury cures the pox,
but it scrambles the mind.

992
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:26,811
Poses a problem for a gent, does it not?

993
01:15:26,846 --> 01:15:28,458
The prick or the brain?

994
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:31,333
Shh. Johnny, shush.

995
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:53,451
He's been seen in Cheapside,
accompanied by a serving man and a whore.

996
01:15:55,220 --> 01:15:57,370
If he's very drunk, he'll be no problem.

997
01:15:57,620 --> 01:15:59,576
If he's a bit drunk, be careful.

998
01:15:59,611 --> 01:16:01,905
What if he's sober?

999
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:03,293
You've got the wrong man.

1000
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:09,176
Ladies and gents!

1001
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:11,119
Gather near!

1002
01:16:11,154 --> 01:16:12,618
Listen well.

1003
01:16:12,980 --> 01:16:17,157
For I got a doctor's cure to sell.

1004
01:16:17,192 --> 01:16:21,334
Mouth, stomach, knees and toes.

1005
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:25,573
All be cured by Dr Bendo.

1006
01:16:29,740 --> 01:16:31,935
Little chicken.

1007
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:42,017
Questurino!

1008
01:16:45,419 --> 01:16:46,932
Mayo.

1009
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:49,253
In honestus.

1010
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:52,099
Gulpo.

1011
01:16:56,020 --> 01:16:57,009
Poofay.

1012
01:17:20,580 --> 01:17:24,016
In flatuo. In flatuo.

1013
01:17:24,419 --> 01:17:28,492
The French, Parliament, his syphilitic earlship.

1014
01:17:28,980 --> 01:17:33,053
I'm being pissed on
from half a dozen directions at once,

1015
01:17:33,088 --> 01:17:36,210
and it don't accord with my majestic dignity.

1016
01:17:36,580 --> 01:17:39,856
We have three confirmed sightings.
Our sources are impeccable.

1017
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:43,016
Take me to them. Now.

1018
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:45,896
I've shut up shop for the day.

1019
01:17:46,339 --> 01:17:48,694
I had to turn 40 people away.

1020
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:53,409
I think it mean work
cozening citizens of their money.

1021
01:17:53,539 --> 01:17:55,424
We made £80 today.

1022
01:17:55,459 --> 01:17:58,212
We are here for our recreation.

1023
01:17:58,339 --> 01:18:00,694
We're here cos
we can't show our faces.

1024
01:18:00,740 --> 01:18:04,574
Do you ever think... on our Lord Jesus Christ?

1025
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:10,090
He was cast like me into the wilderness.

1026
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:13,256
He was scorned and reviled.

1027
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:17,290
He was betrayed by his followers.

1028
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:22,899
I believe that in most respects,
his life was of a different character from yours.

1029
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:26,450
He would have brought Billy Downs
back from death.

1030
01:18:26,485 --> 01:18:28,176
Ach, these are wandering thoughts.

1031
01:18:36,220 --> 01:18:37,938
Leave me.

1032
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:42,976
Go!

1033
01:18:53,379 --> 01:18:54,289
Johnny!

1034
01:18:56,580 --> 01:18:58,013
Johnny!

1035
01:18:58,020 --> 01:19:00,329
Argh! Johnny!

1036
01:19:03,300 --> 01:19:04,813
Leave him alone!

1037
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:08,136
On your knees.

1038
01:19:18,660 --> 01:19:20,616
I'm not impressed.

1039
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:25,225
It has taken you six months to find me.

1040
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:29,492
You think in six months I've given you
more than five minutes' thought?

1041
01:19:29,527 --> 01:19:32,451
Those Parliament bastards
are trying to shaft me again

1042
01:19:32,700 --> 01:19:35,498
wih the new bill to exclude my successors

1043
01:19:35,533 --> 01:19:37,171
Subtle.

1044
01:19:37,339 --> 01:19:41,571
Instead of chopping kings' heads off,
you pick and choose the ones you want.

1045
01:19:43,100 --> 01:19:46,092
That's my civil war. Not you.

1046
01:19:53,499 --> 01:19:59,051
Mr Etherege is packing out the Dorset Gardens
with you as the greatest spark on Earth.

1047
01:19:59,260 --> 01:20:03,811
The East End is throwing down its purse
for you to be a quack doctor.

1048
01:20:04,060 --> 01:20:09,453
And the town has you branded as a coward
who leaves his friend to die in a brawl.

1049
01:20:09,488 --> 01:20:11,489
All men would be cowards...

1050
01:20:11,524 --> 01:20:13,490
if they only had the courage.

1051
01:20:13,660 --> 01:20:16,299
The boy died and you ran off.

1052
01:20:16,539 --> 01:20:18,495
I have to go too far, do you see?

1053
01:20:20,379 --> 01:20:23,132
I must always exceed
or I do not feel like I'm alive.

1054
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:28,254
And that's why the great epic about my reign
became a squalid little play about knobbing.

1055
01:20:28,289 --> 01:20:30,176
And that's why Downs died.

1056
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:38,093
I thought about putting you in the Tower.

1057
01:20:41,980 --> 01:20:45,211
I even considered putting your head on a spike.

1058
01:20:46,740 --> 01:20:49,254
But I've decided on something worse.

1059
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:52,536
I'm going to ignore you

1060
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:58,132
I will no longer encourage
any hope in my breast for you.

1061
01:20:59,339 --> 01:21:01,728
I am condemning you to be you,

1062
01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:03,890
for the rest of your days

1063
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:35,216
How I hate the country.

1064
01:21:47,180 --> 01:21:48,898
Drink.

1065
01:21:50,060 --> 01:21:51,334
Drink!

1066
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:07,458
The shelves are empty, my lord.

1067
01:22:07,820 --> 01:22:09,776
Go to the cellars, cunt!

1068
01:22:11,180 --> 01:22:13,774
I said, find me a fucking drink.

1069
01:22:58,459 --> 01:23:02,088
Are you unable to discharge your duties
as housekeeper?

1070
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:05,531
ALCOCK: I fear this is the last my lord

1071
01:23:06,620 --> 01:23:09,373
Elizabeth, why has the cellar
not been replenished?

1072
01:23:09,499 --> 01:23:10,727
Leave us.

1073
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:13,253
Leave us!

1074
01:23:13,339 --> 01:23:15,375
My lady.

1075
01:23:30,339 --> 01:23:33,888
I am ever your last resort. When your mistress
has kicked you into the street

1076
01:23:33,923 --> 01:23:36,817
and the last whore in Covent Garden
refuses to attend to you,

1077
01:23:37,060 --> 01:23:38,812
then and only then do you come to me!

1078
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:43,929
I think you will never be a contented woman
until you are a much-respected widow.

1079
01:23:43,964 --> 01:23:47,336
And I am hard at work
on doing you that last good service.

1080
01:23:47,419 --> 01:23:51,253
I don't want you to die!
I want you to live, and live differently!

1081
01:23:54,419 --> 01:23:56,375
- Ow!
- Stop it!

1082
01:24:03,860 --> 01:24:05,452
Elizabeth!

1083
01:24:06,940 --> 01:24:10,145
Why? If it's good for you,
is it not good for me, too?

1084
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:13,616
- It is not good for me.
- Why then do you pursue that path?

1085
01:24:16,339 --> 01:24:18,136
When were you last a sober man?

1086
01:24:23,980 --> 01:24:25,936
Three years...

1087
01:24:26,860 --> 01:24:28,816
No, four...

1088
01:24:30,220 --> 01:24:32,176
Four years ago.

1089
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:35,898
Five. Five.

1090
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:38,016
And are you not, John, a rational man?

1091
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:42,254
Has not your intellect been widely praised?

1092
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:44,945
It has.

1093
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:46,936
So, this man of intellect,

1094
01:24:47,260 --> 01:24:49,145
this rational man,

1095
01:24:49,180 --> 01:24:53,731
knowing that five years of constant drinking
have rendered his body feeble and his spirit low,

1096
01:24:53,980 --> 01:24:55,865
what would this man of intellect do?

1097
01:24:55,900 --> 01:24:59,256
- You seek to trap me like a cunning lawyer!
- What would he do?

1098
01:24:59,260 --> 01:25:01,979
He would desist! Cunt!

1099
01:25:02,020 --> 01:25:03,931
Yes, he would desist. And those he loved,

1100
01:25:04,260 --> 01:25:07,013
would they not show their love
by beseeching him to desist?

1101
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:09,608
It is not so simple, my darling.

1102
01:25:48,900 --> 01:25:51,419
I've heard men say that the devil is in you.

1103
01:25:51,454 --> 01:25:53,939
If that be so, I know how he made his entrance.

1104
01:26:03,780 --> 01:26:07,773
He has suffered much
both in sickness and in reputation.

1105
01:26:10,020 --> 01:26:11,976
You're a man of God.

1106
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:14,731
Bring my son to him.

1107
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:24,384
My son,

1108
01:26:24,419 --> 01:26:27,570
God has seen fit
to visit these terrible diseases on you.

1109
01:26:28,740 --> 01:26:33,097
But it torments me less as a mother
to see you die in agony in the arms of God...

1110
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:36,215
.. than live an atheist.

1111
01:26:36,419 --> 01:26:37,977
Mother.

1112
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:05,977
If God wants men to have faith,

1113
01:27:08,020 --> 01:27:10,693
why does he not make us
more disposed to believe?

1114
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:14,017
Most men are so disposed.

1115
01:27:14,740 --> 01:27:16,145
But not me.

1116
01:27:16,180 --> 01:27:19,456
Because you set your reason against religion.

1117
01:27:19,540 --> 01:27:21,132
I despised reason.

1118
01:27:21,459 --> 01:27:23,415
You clung to reason.

1119
01:27:24,339 --> 01:27:27,809
You laughed in the face of God
with the aid of reason.

1120
01:27:30,100 --> 01:27:32,056
Speak me that speech again.

1121
01:27:33,940 --> 01:27:35,896
Those words from Isaiah.

1122
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:43,534
"And he is despised and rejected of men.

1123
01:27:44,980 --> 01:27:46,936
A man of sorrows...

1124
01:27:48,339 --> 01:27:50,295
.. and acquainted with grief. "

1125
01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:53,973
And we hid our faces from him.

1126
01:27:55,540 --> 01:27:57,658
God, raise me from this bed

1127
01:27:57,693 --> 01:27:59,776
to do what I must do

1128
01:28:02,940 --> 01:28:06,091
We've taken soundings.
It's very close. We may be 15 votes short.

1129
01:28:06,260 --> 01:28:08,933
The House cannot give way to the King
on this matter!

1130
01:28:08,968 --> 01:28:10,776
Then get me 15 votes.

1131
01:28:11,220 --> 01:28:13,176
And I believe it will not!

1132
01:28:13,211 --> 01:28:14,976
Hear, hear!

1133
01:28:22,860 --> 01:28:25,852
The Earl of Rochester.

1134
01:28:27,419 --> 01:28:29,375
MAN: Coward!

1135
01:28:30,660 --> 01:28:33,299
ANOTHER MAN: Coward

1136
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:41,976
My lord...

1137
01:28:43,379 --> 01:28:48,407
.. the bill before us would seek to bar
the King's brother from succeeding to the throne

1138
01:28:48,660 --> 01:28:51,732
on the grounds that he is a Catholic.

1139
01:28:52,980 --> 01:28:56,185
And for this reason i has been said

1140
01:28:56,220 --> 01:29:00,771
that no good Protestant
can speak against this bill.

1141
01:29:01,820 --> 01:29:07,690
And yet, sir, I cannot forbear
to offer some objections against it.

1142
01:29:09,020 --> 01:29:15,255
But the question will arise
in the minds of some lords here present...

1143
01:29:16,220 --> 01:29:18,176
.. as to whether I am indeed...

1144
01:29:20,060 --> 01:29:22,016
.. a good Protestant.

1145
01:29:25,339 --> 01:29:27,225
No man here

1146
01:29:27,260 --> 01:29:29,216
will question, I hope,

1147
01:29:31,580 --> 01:29:33,536
my goodness...

1148
01:29:34,459 --> 01:29:38,338
.. in any one of the three chief pursuits
of our age,

1149
01:29:38,373 --> 01:29:40,131
the scribbling of verses,

1150
01:29:40,220 --> 01:29:42,575
the emptying of bottles,

1151
01:29:43,580 --> 01:29:45,536
and the filling of wenches.

1152
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:50,539
There may be those
with a claim to be as good as I,

1153
01:29:51,740 --> 01:29:55,813
but taking these three pursuits simultaneously...

1154
01:29:56,660 --> 01:29:58,616
.. and, sir, I have so taken them,

1155
01:29:58,780 --> 01:30:04,889
and can vouch
that considerable manual dexterity is required,

1156
01:30:05,980 --> 01:30:10,895
I cannot be equalled, let alone bettered.

1157
01:30:13,660 --> 01:30:19,656
So, let not my goodness be questioned.

1158
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:30,976
It is not so many years
since our present king's father

1159
01:30:32,499 --> 01:30:37,209
.. was killed on a kind of stage,
outside the walls of this very building.

1160
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:45,893
And, in time, his murderers were condemned
and themselves executed.

1161
01:30:46,740 --> 01:30:48,625
But...

1162
01:30:48,660 --> 01:30:52,812
were they condemned without being heard?

1163
01:30:55,860 --> 01:30:57,816
They were not.

1164
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:04,214
In spite of the certainty of their guilt
and the horrid weight of their cowardly crime,

1165
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:10,058
they were allowed the due process of law.

1166
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:14,535
But what is suggested before this House...

1167
01:31:15,540 --> 01:31:19,931
.. is that we condemn
that murdered king's second son

1168
01:31:19,966 --> 01:31:23,899
with less shrift than was given to his killers.

1169
01:31:26,100 --> 01:31:30,093
My lord, let us have justice.

1170
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:39,494
When the time arrives for our good
and present king to be taken from us

1171
01:31:41,940 --> 01:31:47,139
let then his Catholic brother be impeached
in this House in the normal way.

1172
01:31:49,140 --> 01:31:54,498
And if he be found wanting,
then let his head be chopped off at the neck...

1173
01:31:57,140 --> 01:31:59,973
if the House feel that is what he meris

1174
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:04,785
For my part

1175
01:32:04,820 --> 01:32:09,177
I shall believe my oath of allegiance
to the throne to be a thing inviolable...

1176
01:32:10,580 --> 01:32:14,016
.. and that whatever the faith
of the successor to the throne,

1177
01:32:14,900 --> 01:32:20,577
his pre-eminence in the royal lineage
must hold sway

1178
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:23,538
over all other considerations.

1179
01:32:25,459 --> 01:32:27,415
Sir,

1180
01:32:27,860 --> 01:32:30,169
my humble motion...

1181
01:32:31,220 --> 01:32:33,176
.. is that the monarchy...

1182
01:32:33,211 --> 01:32:35,096
be upheld...

1183
01:32:36,020 --> 01:32:43,051
.. and this meddlesome and fractious bill
be thrown out forever.

1184
01:32:43,220 --> 01:32:45,176
MEMBERS: Hear, hear!

1185
01:32:47,540 --> 01:32:50,213
MAN: Kings are kings!
You can't pick and choose!

1186
01:32:51,379 --> 01:32:53,529
MAN: Throw it out! Throw it out!

1187
01:32:54,740 --> 01:32:56,696
MAN: He spoke for us all!

1188
01:33:16,860 --> 01:33:18,816
Johnny.

1189
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:21,216
You did it.

1190
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:24,096
You finally did something for me.

1191
01:33:25,020 --> 01:33:26,976
I didn't do it for you.

1192
01:33:27,011 --> 01:33:28,896
I did it for me.

1193
01:33:32,220 --> 01:33:34,814
Your Majesty, we won.

1194
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:36,692
By 40 votes.

1195
01:33:44,620 --> 01:33:46,576
There you are, Johnny.

1196
01:33:47,980 --> 01:33:49,936
You did it.

1197
01:33:53,419 --> 01:33:54,818
Molly.

1198
01:33:54,860 --> 01:33:57,977
I've brought in the Earl to gawp at my triumph.

1199
01:33:58,220 --> 01:34:01,292
Authors have a place, Mr Etherege.
It is in the garret.

1200
01:34:01,327 --> 01:34:03,455
I do not like them cluttering up my theatre.

1201
01:34:03,499 --> 01:34:06,855
Lizzie won't see him.
She won't see Johnny. This is the only way.

1202
01:34:06,860 --> 01:34:08,612
I don't want her upset.

1203
01:34:08,780 --> 01:34:10,816
I could have written a splendid play.

1204
01:34:11,180 --> 01:34:13,118
No, you couldn't.

1205
01:34:13,153 --> 01:34:14,985
The Man Of Mode.

1206
01:34:15,020 --> 01:34:18,490
The spirit of the age caught for all time.

1207
01:34:18,860 --> 01:34:20,265
I did it.

1208
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:23,656
You didn't, because you don't have the gift.

1209
01:34:27,020 --> 01:34:28,658
Gentle George.

1210
01:34:35,180 --> 01:34:37,410
- What is he doing here?
- Don't blame me.

1211
01:34:39,020 --> 01:34:41,215
John, I'll see you after. I'll be at Long's.

1212
01:34:41,419 --> 01:34:44,411
Very well. Lockett's?

1213
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:47,214
Long's.

1214
01:34:49,580 --> 01:34:51,536
Long's.

1215
01:34:58,220 --> 01:35:00,176
I saw the first two acts.

1216
01:35:02,060 --> 01:35:04,016
And you didn't like me?

1217
01:35:04,051 --> 01:35:05,865
To the contrary.

1218
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:08,573
I could bear your brilliance no longer.

1219
01:35:12,620 --> 01:35:14,975
Mr Harris, you are playing me.

1220
01:35:15,020 --> 01:35:18,137
The understudy has become the actor.

1221
01:35:18,379 --> 01:35:21,576
My lord, I heard news of your death
six months ago

1222
01:35:21,611 --> 01:35:23,256
and experienced a spasm of regret.

1223
01:35:23,700 --> 01:35:27,056
But your subsequent resurrection
has quite cured my grief.

1224
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:32,491
I am nature, and you are art.

1225
01:35:34,740 --> 01:35:36,625
Let us see how we compare.

1226
01:35:36,660 --> 01:35:39,891
Mr Harris has a quick change
and you will let him be.

1227
01:35:40,060 --> 01:35:42,654
Here we have him, your Restoration gent.

1228
01:35:42,689 --> 01:35:44,609
He's not pissed his breeches today

1229
01:35:44,860 --> 01:35:50,696
and he can walk in a straight line for 200 yards
without falling on his face and retching.

1230
01:35:51,580 --> 01:35:53,536
Now,

1231
01:35:53,980 --> 01:35:56,653
look you upon this picture

1232
01:35:56,688 --> 01:35:58,335
and on this

1233
01:35:58,700 --> 01:36:00,975
He has not washed He cannot walk

1234
01:36:01,100 --> 01:36:07,255
And he most certainly will not be able to raise
either the price of his dinner or his own pintle.

1235
01:36:07,290 --> 01:36:09,176
I must be got into my nightgown.

1236
01:36:09,339 --> 01:36:11,409
This is what I envy in you stage people.

1237
01:36:11,444 --> 01:36:13,751
You make time seem so important.

1238
01:36:13,786 --> 01:36:16,058
I must change my clothes now!

1239
01:36:16,540 --> 01:36:18,337
I must make my entrance now!

1240
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:22,538
But life is not a succession of urgent nows.

1241
01:36:22,573 --> 01:36:25,137
It is a listless trickle of Why should I's.

1242
01:36:25,220 --> 01:36:26,812
You're on.

1243
01:36:29,540 --> 01:36:31,576
MOLLY: Five minutes only, Mrs Barry.

1244
01:36:37,700 --> 01:36:39,975
Inever wanted you for a mistress, Lizzie.

1245
01:36:41,540 --> 01:36:43,258
I wanted you for my wife.

1246
01:36:46,820 --> 01:36:48,776
You have no understanding, do you?

1247
01:36:51,620 --> 01:36:55,818
It was not being your mistress
that I was tired of, John.

1248
01:36:56,419 --> 01:36:57,738
I was tired of you.

1249
01:36:58,820 --> 01:37:01,209
I did not wish to be your wife.

1250
01:37:01,220 --> 01:37:03,780
I do not wish to be anyone's wife.

1251
01:37:04,100 --> 01:37:07,058
I wish to continue being the creature I am.

1252
01:37:07,940 --> 01:37:10,500
London walks into this theatre to see me.

1253
01:37:10,820 --> 01:37:14,145
Not George's play, nor Mr Betterton.

1254
01:37:14,180 --> 01:37:16,933
They want me,
and they want me over and over again.

1255
01:37:18,020 --> 01:37:22,536
I will not swap my certain glory
for your undependable love.

1256
01:37:26,180 --> 01:37:28,136
I wanted you to have my child.

1257
01:37:28,171 --> 01:37:30,056
I had your child.

1258
01:37:30,980 --> 01:37:32,865
A daughter.

1259
01:37:32,900 --> 01:37:35,334
When the theatres were closed in the summer.

1260
01:37:35,780 --> 01:37:40,012
By the start of the season I was flat enough
to play Desdemona in a nightgown.

1261
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:42,250
MOLLY: Two minutes, Mrs Barry, please.

1262
01:37:43,940 --> 01:37:45,896
What is her name?

1263
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:48,333
Elizabeth.

1264
01:37:48,740 --> 01:37:50,696
Elizabeth?

1265
01:37:52,100 --> 01:37:54,056
The child of our passion.

1266
01:37:56,419 --> 01:38:00,970
When I bred my other children,
I placed no value on human life at all, and...

1267
01:38:03,140 --> 01:38:05,096
...now you send me away.

1268
01:38:06,020 --> 01:38:09,057
And I cannot go back to where I was before.

1269
01:38:11,300 --> 01:38:14,770
I shall never forgive you
for teaching me to love life.

1270
01:38:17,060 --> 01:38:20,336
If I taught you that, then our account is settled.

1271
01:38:21,379 --> 01:38:23,557
Your lesson to me was my livelihood.

1272
01:38:23,592 --> 01:38:25,736
And mine to you was life itself.

1273
01:38:27,140 --> 01:38:29,096
We have no need to meet again.

1274
01:38:30,980 --> 01:38:33,096
Lizzie.

1275
01:38:33,379 --> 01:38:35,265
If you are in London,

1276
01:38:35,300 --> 01:38:37,450
and you have half a crown in your pocket,

1277
01:38:37,700 --> 01:38:39,656
you may see me there.

1278
01:38:39,691 --> 01:38:41,576
For the rest,

1279
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:44,536
I hope I shall always be in your heart,

1280
01:38:44,900 --> 01:38:47,255
sometimes in your thoughts,

1281
01:38:47,300 --> 01:38:49,894
but never in your debt.

1282
01:39:26,220 --> 01:39:28,176
I am 33...

1283
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:31,056
.. years old.

1284
01:39:33,419 --> 01:39:35,375
I am dying.

1285
01:39:37,740 --> 01:39:40,538
I have tried to speak the truth.

1286
01:39:42,540 --> 01:39:45,100
But I have been betrayed.

1287
01:39:54,540 --> 01:39:56,496
Elizabeth...

1288
01:39:59,339 --> 01:40:03,537
.. speak to me of abduction.

1289
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:09,456
I was 18.

1290
01:40:11,820 --> 01:40:15,017
And worth two and a half thousand a year.

1291
01:40:16,620 --> 01:40:18,576
You ambushed me,

1292
01:40:20,459 --> 01:40:23,098
bundled me into your coach
and rattled me away.

1293
01:40:24,780 --> 01:40:26,736
The King thrust...

1294
01:41:21,620 --> 01:41:24,612
He charmed the tenderest virgins with delight.

1295
01:41:25,459 --> 01:41:29,418
And with his style did fiercest blockheads fright.

1296
01:42:06,740 --> 01:42:08,810
So, there he lies at the last.

1297
01:42:09,620 --> 01:42:11,558
The deathbed convert.

1298
01:42:11,593 --> 01:42:13,496
The pious debauchee.

1299
01:42:15,379 --> 01:42:17,939
Could not dance half a measure, could I?

1300
01:42:19,700 --> 01:42:23,659
Give me wine, I'd drain the dregs
and toss the empty bottle at the world.

1301
01:42:24,500 --> 01:42:26,384
Show me our Lord Jesus in agony,

1302
01:42:26,419 --> 01:42:30,856
and I mount the cross
and steal his nails for my own palms.

1303
01:42:33,140 --> 01:42:40,057
There I go, shuffling from the world,
my dribble fresh upon a Bible.

1304
01:42:41,780 --> 01:42:46,012
I look upon a pinhead...
and I see angels dancing.

1305
01:42:48,500 --> 01:42:50,456
Well?

1306
01:42:51,860 --> 01:42:53,816
Do you like me now?

1307
01:42:57,140 --> 01:42:59,096
Do you like me now?

1308
01:43:04,339 --> 01:43:06,295
Do you like me now?

1309
01:43:11,060 --> 01:43:13,016
Do you like me...

1310
01:43:13,051 --> 01:43:14,936
now?
