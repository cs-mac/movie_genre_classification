CJ ENTERTAINMENT PRESENTS

2
00:00:40,751 --> 00:00:44,042
AN ANIMAL PLANET PRODUCTION
INASSOCIATION WITH CJ ENTERTAINMENT

3
00:00:44,834 --> 00:00:48,001
EXECUTIVE PRODUCER
JEONG TAE-SUNG

00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:12,626
JUNG WOO-SUNG

5
00:02:20,584 --> 00:02:24,334
LEE SOM

6
00:02:24,334 --> 00:02:27,626
These scentless petals covering
the road endlessly make me forget

7
00:02:29,084 --> 00:02:36,042
why I decided to come here.

8
00:02:50,292 --> 00:02:54,459
When a ridiculous misunderstanding forced me
to leave the school

9
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:56,209
I just wanted to hide

10
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:59,917
where nobody could find me.

11
00:03:02,626 --> 00:03:08,542
I hoped to find something pure
that is vanishing from me,

12
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:11,792
to prove myself writing a novel
with a new story I find there.

13
00:03:24,084 --> 00:03:27,751
But my strong intention faded away
as soon as I arrived.

14
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:40,417
The old and weary mood this town held

15
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,167
almost choked me.

16
00:04:20,334 --> 00:04:21,876
What is this kid?

17
00:04:23,251 --> 00:04:25,709
Never seen a man in a suit?

18
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:54,084
She stared me
with the inquisitive eyes.

19
00:04:55,126 --> 00:04:57,042
That's how I met her.

20
00:05:04,376 --> 00:05:14,709
DIRECTED BY YIM PIL-SUNG

21
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:25,251
He's too young to be a professor.

22
00:05:26,001 --> 00:05:29,042
Guess he had a drink. Look at his ruddy cheeks.

23
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:31,126
You know the writer...

24
00:05:31,126 --> 00:05:35,167
needs a drink to talk or write on something.

25
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:39,959
"INTRODUCTION TO WRITING A NOVEL"

26
00:05:45,751 --> 00:05:48,667
- You want to write novels?
-Yes.

27
00:05:49,584 --> 00:05:52,042
You think anyone can write one?

28
00:05:53,417 --> 00:05:55,584
That's why we're here to learn.

29
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,917
There's an expression called literary youth.

30
00:05:57,917 --> 00:06:00,167
But no such thing like literary old.

31
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:01,501
Do you know why?

32
00:06:01,501 --> 00:06:04,834
You are telling we old folks
don't deserve writing?

33
00:06:04,834 --> 00:06:07,334
Yes, the old can”: write.

34
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:10,292
They can only keep a diary.

35
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:15,626
The old man with an old mind
only can write corny things.

36
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:20,709
Only the one with an open mind
can do the literature.

37
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:23,209
So if you want to write novels,

38
00:06:23,501 --> 00:06:26,876
you need to be young at heart again.

39
00:06:27,376 --> 00:06:28,667
You need to love!

40
00:06:29,584 --> 00:06:32,209
At our age? How?

41
00:06:32,334 --> 00:06:34,792
But it sounds good!

42
00:06:40,417 --> 00:06:43,459
- Hello.
-You're coming home now?

43
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:46,376
Tofu and zucchini, please.

44
00:06:46,376 --> 00:06:47,792
Sure.

45
00:06:52,126 --> 00:06:53,167
Mom!

46
00:06:55,251 --> 00:06:58,459
Just now. What do want to get?

47
00:07:00,542 --> 00:07:02,167
Tofu and zucchini?

48
00:07:03,042 --> 00:07:05,292
I got them already. Let's go.

49
00:07:05,709 --> 00:07:08,126
Will make you delicious bean paste stew.

50
00:07:09,667 --> 00:07:14,126
You raised Deokee well. So pretty and filial.

51
00:07:14,126 --> 00:07:15,751
You must be proud!

52
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:17,959
- Good night.
-Good night.

53
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:29,584
Mom, store owner told me

54
00:07:30,209 --> 00:07:32,917
this town will be redeveloped.

55
00:07:33,626 --> 00:07:37,292
So are we getting lots of compensation?

56
00:07:37,542 --> 00:07:40,251
Well...guess it would some.

57
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:44,834
Much enough to move to Seoul?
What do you think?

58
00:07:44,917 --> 00:07:49,417
I hope the money is big enough
for your wedding.

59
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:51,709
My wedding? No kidding!

60
00:07:51,792 --> 00:07:56,959
You should get married
when you meet a decent guy.

61
00:08:02,501 --> 00:08:06,084
If there is a decent guy,
I need to date him first.

62
00:08:06,501 --> 00:08:09,126
But problem is we can't find a decent man here.

63
00:08:09,417 --> 00:08:13,126
The store owner will set you up
on a blind date.

64
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:14,917
A guy working at a car company.

65
00:08:15,376 --> 00:08:16,959
A car company?

66
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:19,917
Boring!

67
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:23,001
You don't get married for fun!

68
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:28,167
Are you worried about me?

69
00:08:29,292 --> 00:08:30,709
Don't worry.

70
00:08:31,626 --> 00:08:34,501
I won't live like this forever.

71
00:08:35,042 --> 00:08:37,584
I believe in you.

72
00:08:50,876 --> 00:08:52,959
The machine is too old.

73
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:55,167
It needs some bashing once in a while.

74
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:03,709
What do you want to ride?

75
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:05,251
Pardon?

76
00:09:05,876 --> 00:09:08,751
The rides in this park. Which one?

77
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:11,876
I didn't come for that.

78
00:09:13,376 --> 00:09:15,042
Are you working here?

79
00:09:16,334 --> 00:09:17,376
Right there.

80
00:09:20,084 --> 00:09:22,001
At the ticket office, I see.

81
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:27,709
I've never seen a small amusement park
like this.

82
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:32,459
They'll tear it down next year
and will build a public park.

83
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:37,542
Nobody came to ride in full dress like you.

84
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:39,792
I'm not here for the ride,

85
00:09:40,334 --> 00:09:41,751
but for the work.
At the lifelong education center.

86
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:44,751
No one's dressed up there, either.

87
00:09:46,334 --> 00:09:47,251
I remember!

88
00:09:47,584 --> 00:09:49,209
You were in front of the store yesterday.

89
00:09:50,751 --> 00:09:52,417
So are you a professor?

90
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:53,959
Yes.

91
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:57,209
- Literature writing class.
-Wow.

92
00:09:58,042 --> 00:10:00,959
Thought that class would be really interesting.

93
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:29,167
She didn't get along with anyone,
and responded to no one.

94
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:34,084
She simply existed there still and sound.

95
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,792
As if she couldn't see

96
00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:42,459
or hear anything.

97
00:10:45,042 --> 00:10:49,417
She was cowering like a caterpillar

98
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:56,001
waiting for the spring with every fiber
of her body.

99
00:10:57,042 --> 00:11:00,501
The time she would transform
into a beautiful being.

100
00:11:05,251 --> 00:11:07,959
As you are here, you should have a drink.

101
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:09,751
Need to leave soon.

102
00:11:09,751 --> 00:11:13,251
Of course, you must be busy writing.

103
00:11:13,251 --> 00:11:18,376
But a drink could smooth your writing.

104
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:22,334
- Just one glass!
-Then just one.

105
00:11:22,334 --> 00:11:24,001
There you go.

106
00:11:29,334 --> 00:11:33,292
Handsome ones look cool
even drinking monkey swill.

107
00:11:35,251 --> 00:11:38,459
<i>-I'll</i> pour you one.
- Thank you, professor.

108
00:11:44,001 --> 00:11:46,251
It's good!

109
00:11:47,417 --> 00:11:50,542
Deokee, I know you had a blind date yesterday.

110
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:53,834
- What?
-She did? With whom?

111
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:56,626
The second son at the photo studio.

112
00:11:56,626 --> 00:11:58,417
He works at the motor factory.

113
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:01,251
So you'll get married soon!

114
00:12:01,751 --> 00:12:02,959
No.

115
00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:04,751
Why not? That kid is okay.

116
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:06,084
- Yes, he is.
-Right.

117
00:12:06,292 --> 00:12:11,542
- How many babies?
-You're so silly.

118
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:15,917
She needs to square it with parents first.

119
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:18,209
I'll get going-

120
00:12:18,209 --> 00:12:21,084
- Why so early?
-We want to hear more.

121
00:12:21,084 --> 00:12:22,584
It wasn't fun at all.

122
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:25,542
Tell us later! Promise!

123
00:12:59,542 --> 00:13:01,042
Where's your house?

124
00:13:01,542 --> 00:13:02,459
Mine?

125
00:13:03,626 --> 00:13:09,667
The fifth house under the Stairways.

126
00:13:15,376 --> 00:13:16,459
Mine is here.

127
00:13:17,876 --> 00:13:19,667
Guess you need to walk back.

128
00:13:20,084 --> 00:13:24,626
Good night.

129
00:13:26,417 --> 00:13:28,042
Hello, professor.

130
00:13:29,001 --> 00:13:33,501
- Kimchi stew and soju as usual?
-Yes.

131
00:14:33,584 --> 00:14:35,417
Are you writing something?

132
00:14:37,792 --> 00:14:39,834
I'm so bored here, same old shits.

133
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:41,376
So what did the dean say?

134
00:14:42,001 --> 00:14:45,084
He doesn't want to meet you.

135
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:46,501
Why?

136
00:14:46,626 --> 00:14:50,001
He's being cautious as it's a sensitive issue.

137
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:54,209
Be patient. I'll try to persuade him.

138
00:14:55,292 --> 00:15:00,126
We're collecting evidences to prove
that you're falsely accused.

139
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:02,876
Try to take it easy there.

140
00:15:02,876 --> 00:15:05,667
It'll take some time as she's so persistent.

141
00:15:07,084 --> 00:15:09,417
You must feel depressed in that backcountry.

142
00:15:09,792 --> 00:15:13,876
Find some hobby to spend time.

143
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:16,084
Hang in there.

144
00:15:50,834 --> 00:15:52,167
This place closes early.

145
00:15:54,542 --> 00:15:56,501
Yes, at 6 PM.

146
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:01,542
Where are you going once it's demolished?

147
00:16:02,084 --> 00:16:03,167
Wherever.

148
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:07,584
I'll be happy just escaping
from this boring town.

149
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:09,709
Then you should try something not boring.

150
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,001
Like what?

151
00:16:14,876 --> 00:16:17,501
Not the right one to ask. I'm a boring person.

152
00:16:17,834 --> 00:16:20,292
You must be lonely not boring.

153
00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:24,917
Do I look lonely?

154
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:28,376
I can tell as I see many people
coming here alone for a ride.

155
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:31,626
The angry ones scream riding on the pirate ship

156
00:16:32,626 --> 00:16:34,834
while lonely ones ride a merry-go-round.

157
00:16:35,626 --> 00:16:39,001
And the ones to be lost to the world

158
00:16:39,001 --> 00:16:40,542
get on the Ferris wheel.

159
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:43,584
Then I should try all!

160
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:54,167
Can I have a look at the bottle?

161
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:11,042
Yuck! lt's...bitter!

162
00:17:13,501 --> 00:17:15,417
Guess you can't drink.

163
00:17:16,542 --> 00:17:19,292
Yes, I can.

164
00:17:33,251 --> 00:17:36,959
What brought you here, anyway?

165
00:17:39,834 --> 00:17:41,709
They say I did something wrong.

166
00:17:42,251 --> 00:17:46,501
I did nothing but I became the guilty one.

167
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:52,709
<i>I'll</i> go buy things.

168
00:17:52,709 --> 00:17:54,667
Tend the shop for me, Deokee.

169
00:17:57,042 --> 00:18:00,917
The bad things blindly hit you
like the lightening.

170
00:18:02,084 --> 00:18:06,167
My mother says we have to take a shelter
for a while

171
00:18:07,292 --> 00:18:08,917
until it clears up.

172
00:18:12,042 --> 00:18:13,917
Not the case for where I came from.

173
00:18:15,042 --> 00:18:19,792
It's a swamp boiling with the jealousy.

174
00:18:21,292 --> 00:18:24,667
If I waited like that, I'd be bogged down deep.

175
00:18:28,001 --> 00:18:29,417
But thank you, Deokee.

176
00:18:32,542 --> 00:18:38,584
For listening to me and believing what I said.

177
00:18:39,376 --> 00:18:40,876
Nobody did.

178
00:18:42,126 --> 00:18:45,834
It's my pleasure. I enjoy listening to you.

179
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:57,417
When are you coming home?

180
00:19:02,001 --> 00:19:03,876
Can you come tonight?

181
00:19:04,584 --> 00:19:07,251
Daddy will be coming.

182
00:19:12,709 --> 00:19:14,667
Do you have to go to Seoul?

183
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,959
You'd better get going, too.

184
00:19:25,001 --> 00:19:26,167
Yes.

185
00:19:34,084 --> 00:19:38,001
I might be in a trouble
as my wife hates me drinking.

186
00:19:39,042 --> 00:19:42,334
Then go tomorrow when you sober up.

187
00:19:44,459 --> 00:19:45,584
I'm leaving.

188
00:21:24,209 --> 00:21:25,376
80 hot.

189
00:21:26,917 --> 00:21:28,501
It's so hot in here.

190
00:21:30,376 --> 00:21:32,417
Or is it me because of drinking?

191
00:21:39,459 --> 00:21:40,667
You're warm.

192
00:22:02,501 --> 00:22:06,209
Mom, tie my hair.

193
00:22:16,292 --> 00:22:18,251
Your dad is with a girl again.

194
00:22:18,251 --> 00:22:22,001
See he's not coming.

195
00:22:22,792 --> 00:22:25,126
He said he's coming today.

196
00:22:28,667 --> 00:22:33,459
Like father, like daughter. You little liar.

197
00:22:44,959 --> 00:22:47,959
See you later, professor.

198
00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:54,542
Hello, sir.

199
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:55,542
Hello.

200
00:23:02,501 --> 00:23:04,542
He's working too hard.

201
00:23:05,876 --> 00:23:09,917
He must be bored to sit still.

202
00:23:12,251 --> 00:23:15,084
I imagined it would be quite scary
at night here.

203
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:17,834
Are you scared?

204
00:23:18,376 --> 00:23:21,626
Not at all. Because I'm with you.

205
00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:49,376
This is the switch.

206
00:23:50,001 --> 00:23:51,751
Are you sure about this?

207
00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:28,126
Let's stay this way for a while.

208
00:24:29,959 --> 00:24:30,959
Why?

209
00:24:32,042 --> 00:24:36,626
Just to remember this moment.

210
00:24:38,751 --> 00:24:41,917
It's my first date with a man I love.

211
00:26:31,584 --> 00:26:36,751
She comes in and out of his house all the time.

212
00:26:36,751 --> 00:26:42,584
The guard at the park told me he even saw them

213
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:46,417
doing this! Shameless.

214
00:26:46,584 --> 00:26:52,209
We went wild and shameless
at our early days, too.

215
00:26:54,126 --> 00:26:59,001
As the old saying goes
it's always the quiet one.

216
00:27:00,959 --> 00:27:03,751
Oh my, she must've heard us!

217
00:27:03,751 --> 00:27:06,042
It's a nonsense. She's deaf anyway!

218
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:09,292
- Deaf she is but gets what we say.
-It's okay.

219
00:27:09,292 --> 00:27:12,792
Don't know what to do. Oh my god.

220
00:27:16,459 --> 00:27:18,709
She must be really worried.

221
00:27:37,126 --> 00:27:38,251
What do you think?

222
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:49,917
Do you like it?

223
00:27:52,792 --> 00:27:53,917
So pretty.

224
00:29:22,417 --> 00:29:25,501
Professor, when did you buy these?

225
00:30:01,834 --> 00:30:02,667
Try a walk?

226
00:33:27,959 --> 00:33:29,209
Professor!

227
00:34:12,584 --> 00:34:15,376

What's up? Why didn't you call me ahead?

239
00:36:44,501 --> 00:36:47,709
I wanted to deliver the good news myself.

Thank you! How did you find that?

245
00:37:20,334 --> 00:37:25,417
A student came with the thing
she shot with her mobile.

246

It had that bitch coming on to you. All drunk!

247
00:37:30,584 --> 00:37:32,251
And she accused you of sexual harassment?
Bullshit!

333
00:48:01,667 --> 00:48:02,834
Kiss me please.

334
00:48:02,834 --> 00:48:04,292
Please stop.

335
00:48:04,292 --> 00:48:05,334
Don't!

336
00:48:29,459 --> 00:48:30,876
What's with you, Chungee?

337
00:48:33,376 --> 00:48:34,376
What?

338
00:48:35,792 --> 00:48:39,792
Stop crying and stay still.
I'll be right there.

339
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:43,126
Mom!Mom!

340
00:48:43,584 --> 00:48:48,584
Deokee, come back!

341
00:48:48,751 --> 00:48:50,167
It's dangerous!

342
00:49:01,042 --> 00:49:02,084
Deokee!

343
00:49:07,126 --> 00:49:10,209
It's 911.

344
00:49:10,209 --> 00:49:12,501
Hello?

345
00:49:12,709 --> 00:49:18,376
Mom!Mom!

346
00:49:35,167 --> 00:49:38,084
What shall we do? Deokee!

347
00:49:38,084 --> 00:49:40,709
Somebody help here!

348
00:49:40,959 --> 00:49:42,917
Please help here!

349
00:49:42,917 --> 00:49:45,251
- Are there people inside?
-Yes! Please hurry!

350
00:50:05,334 --> 00:50:06,917
Dad...

351
00:50:11,501 --> 00:50:15,251
Mom's still inside the room?

352
00:50:31,584 --> 00:50:33,292
Ma...

353
00:50:50,542 --> 00:50:54,584
On that day, the big wave

354
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:57,917
completely swept away our lives.

355
00:51:15,501 --> 00:51:20,167
So the text can contain several meanings...

356
00:51:20,834 --> 00:51:24,709
which can be changed upon the interpretation.

357
00:51:25,292 --> 00:51:26,626
For example,

358
00:51:27,917 --> 00:51:30,292
the characters of Chun-hyang
in Pansori 'Chun-hyang'

359
00:51:30,292 --> 00:51:31,959
in 'Flower in the Jail',
the modern novel version,

360
00:51:32,751 --> 00:51:36,501
and in the film version, 'Chunhyang'

361
00:51:38,667 --> 00:51:40,626
are different from one to another.

362
00:51:40,626 --> 00:51:44,084
The last piece of purity inside me

363
00:51:45,542 --> 00:51:47,251
was burnt to ashes with them.

364
00:51:47,251 --> 00:51:50,834
- So the text can contain...
-You said it already.

365
00:51:53,834 --> 00:52:01,917
After that day, everything seem blurred to me.

366
00:52:04,751 --> 00:52:07,501
"8 YEARS LATER"

367
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:11,792
Do you expect this one
to be another bestseller?

368
00:52:15,834 --> 00:52:19,376
But ironically my books
became the bestsellers one after another.

369
00:52:19,584 --> 00:52:24,376
And I lived life hard and wild to escape
from the past.

370
00:52:42,834 --> 00:52:44,251
Damn it.

371
00:53:29,751 --> 00:53:31,001
Professor!

372
00:54:42,917 --> 00:54:43,959
Professor!

373
00:54:44,959 --> 00:54:48,126
Who are you going with to the conference
in Tokyo?

374
00:54:49,959 --> 00:54:51,501
Why do you care?

375
00:54:54,751 --> 00:54:56,459
Can I come along?

376
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:59,001
Wanna date with you in Shibuya.

377
00:54:59,001 --> 00:54:59,959
It would be romantic.

378
00:55:00,292 --> 00:55:03,626
Do we need to go to Shibuya to be romantic?

379
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:07,001
What about your thesis and TV show?

380
00:55:07,001 --> 00:55:08,917
You don't have to worry about it.

381
00:55:10,584 --> 00:55:16,501
Told you that our love can only be completed
in the closed room.

382
00:55:17,376 --> 00:55:20,334
You want people to gossip
when they see us together?

383
00:55:22,334 --> 00:55:24,334
Embarrassed to be seen with me?

384
00:55:25,709 --> 00:55:28,126
Think of this place as outside.

385
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:32,334
It's a nonsense! Since I met you...

386
00:55:32,334 --> 00:55:36,292
It's outside. Outside of your house and mine.

387
00:55:36,292 --> 00:55:40,084
Just change your way of thinking.
Not that difficult.

388
00:56:16,626 --> 00:56:20,959
For the youth, dream can be the love...

389
00:56:21,542 --> 00:56:23,667
...that sweeps you away.

390
00:56:24,042 --> 00:56:26,542
What matters is how sincere they feel
about the work...

391
00:56:26,626 --> 00:56:27,667
I'm going out.

392
00:56:29,167 --> 00:56:30,459
Going where?

393
00:56:36,584 --> 00:56:38,001
To see a sis next door.

394
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:45,792
What did you do to your lips?

395
00:56:48,167 --> 00:56:50,501
My only concern was my daughter, Chungee.

396
00:56:50,584 --> 00:56:53,251
...we should search for a job
as we do for pure first love.

397
00:56:53,251 --> 00:56:55,167
Well, I guess so.

398
00:56:56,751 --> 00:57:00,959
Then the fearsome price of my lust

399
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:02,917
knocked at the door.

400
00:57:05,709 --> 00:57:09,334
It is blurry in the center
and everything goes out of focus.

401
00:57:16,167 --> 00:57:17,626
You've got retinal macular degeneration.

402
00:57:18,584 --> 00:57:19,626
What's that?

403
00:57:19,626 --> 00:57:23,334
A problem at macular inside your retina

404
00:57:23,334 --> 00:57:25,584
causes the failing vision.

405
00:57:25,584 --> 00:57:27,626
You have diabetes.

406
00:57:27,959 --> 00:57:30,209
But you keep drinking and smoking

407
00:57:30,209 --> 00:57:32,501
as well as writing which stresses the sight.

408
00:57:32,709 --> 00:57:35,042
I think you've developed the complication.

409
00:57:36,751 --> 00:57:38,834
But I can get better
with some treatment, can't I?

410
00:57:39,084 --> 00:57:45,334
Well...l'm afraid there's no perfect cure yet.

411
00:57:48,626 --> 00:57:51,459
You're telling me

412
00:57:53,292 --> 00:57:55,542
I could lose my eyesight completely?

413
00:57:55,542 --> 00:57:57,501
In the worst case scenario, yes.

414
00:57:57,501 --> 00:58:00,709
But we can at least delay the progress.

415
00:58:00,709 --> 00:58:02,334
Be sure to take diabetes medicine.

416
00:58:03,084 --> 00:58:04,876
And no excessive exercise.

417
00:58:04,876 --> 00:58:06,917
Also absolutely no alcohol and cigarettes!

418
00:58:13,167 --> 00:58:14,501
How about sex?

419
00:58:16,584 --> 00:58:17,667
Pardon?

420
00:58:19,167 --> 00:58:23,626
I heard you visit the luxurious villa
in Gangnam regularly.

421
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:25,501
Pardon?

422
00:58:26,292 --> 00:58:29,959
The rumor says it's an illegal gambling place.

423
00:58:34,501 --> 00:58:40,751
I heard some public figures were involved
in Group K's slush fund.

424
00:58:41,459 --> 00:58:44,292
You went to college with Lee,
the CEO of Group K.

425
00:58:45,376 --> 00:58:47,709
We won't make a fuss

426
00:58:47,709 --> 00:58:50,792
as it can ruin school's reputation.

427
00:58:50,792 --> 00:58:51,751
Mr. Dean.

428
00:58:51,834 --> 00:58:56,501
I feel bad doing this as you're the face
of our faculty.

429
00:58:56,501 --> 00:58:58,667
You'll get the leave allowance right away.

430
00:58:58,792 --> 00:59:00,209
All gone?

431
00:59:00,209 --> 00:59:03,417
I can't believe how this bastard could be CEO

432
00:59:03,417 --> 00:59:06,626
being so clumsy handling the work.

433
00:59:08,917 --> 00:59:12,417
You know how much I bet for that?

434
00:59:12,417 --> 00:59:14,417
My new car is gone too!

435
00:59:14,876 --> 00:59:18,167
- At least you have a bestselling book...
-Shut up!

436
00:59:19,126 --> 00:59:21,959
I put all my <i>3</i> year advance and down payment!

437
00:59:54,501 --> 00:59:58,126
Chungee always strayed and didn't care
about me at all.

438
00:59:59,501 --> 01:00:02,084
She seemed to desperately

439
01:00:03,167 --> 01:00:05,751
search for someone to rely
on even for a short moment.

440
01:00:14,251 --> 01:00:15,334
"SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT"

441
01:00:16,501 --> 01:00:18,542
"PROVISIONAL ATTACHMENT ON lMMOVABLES"

442
01:00:33,459 --> 01:00:35,376
Notice of seizure? What is it?

443
01:00:37,042 --> 01:00:39,834
Nothing. Mind your own business.

444
01:01:01,001 --> 01:01:03,626
- You're living next door?
-Yes.

445
01:01:05,459 --> 01:01:08,084
I guess Chungee's not home.

446
01:01:08,792 --> 01:01:10,834
Brought some pancakes for her.

447
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,501
She's at school now.

448
01:01:14,959 --> 01:01:16,792
You don't like the pancakes?

449
01:01:28,292 --> 01:01:30,751
You must be Professor Shim.

450
01:01:32,501 --> 01:01:34,667
I've heard from Chungee

451
01:01:35,251 --> 01:01:37,959
that your visions are failing lately.

452
01:01:38,834 --> 01:01:40,917
Guess you're close to my daughter.

453
01:01:41,584 --> 01:01:45,001
Yes, we got along very easily.

454
01:01:48,251 --> 01:01:51,626
Rustling sunlight falls like the fireworks

455
01:01:52,084 --> 01:01:54,792
glowing her hair all over.

456
01:01:55,417 --> 01:01:57,251
I like this novel.

457
01:01:58,667 --> 01:01:59,751
You do?

458
01:02:02,417 --> 01:02:06,334
Professor, treat me as a fan of your work.

459
01:02:06,709 --> 01:02:11,084
You can be at ease with me.

460
01:02:13,251 --> 01:02:17,334
My name is Se-jung. Yoon Se-jung.

461
01:02:18,959 --> 01:02:22,417
Pleasure to meet you, Ms. Yoon Se-jung.

462
01:02:27,084 --> 01:02:31,917
How's your father lately?
He seemed quite lonely.

463
01:02:33,084 --> 01:02:38,126
He's a lonely man with a failing vision.

464
01:02:40,001 --> 01:02:41,709
But I hate him.

465
01:02:43,084 --> 01:02:46,959
You should not. He's your father anyway.

466
01:02:48,292 --> 01:02:50,459
I typed his writing yesterday.

467
01:02:51,126 --> 01:02:52,751
You did what? Why?

468
01:02:54,126 --> 01:02:56,417
I like his novels a lot.

469
01:02:57,626 --> 01:02:59,542
Can I help him writing?

470
01:03:01,209 --> 01:03:03,626
Then can I go to see you every day?

471
01:03:13,417 --> 01:03:14,626
What is it?

472
01:03:15,334 --> 01:03:17,167
I can't read your handwriting.

473
01:03:20,167 --> 01:03:21,417
Which part?

474
01:03:22,334 --> 01:03:25,542
What would it feel like
if the whole world disappears?

475
01:03:25,542 --> 01:03:27,084
And then?

476
01:03:28,876 --> 01:03:30,834
What did I write?

477
01:03:34,917 --> 01:03:39,292
How is your sight lately?

478
01:03:40,501 --> 01:03:44,667
It got worse than when I first saw you, right?

479
01:03:45,084 --> 01:03:46,917
Think so, but can't tell exactly

480
01:03:48,042 --> 01:03:50,376
as I haven't been to the hospital lately.

481
01:03:50,542 --> 01:03:53,001
Things were just out of focus before...

482
01:03:54,209 --> 01:03:57,959
but everything became blurry at some point.

483
01:04:00,917 --> 01:04:04,876
The glasses don't help actually.

484
01:04:05,626 --> 01:04:07,667
Let's see an eye doctor with me.

485
01:04:07,667 --> 01:04:09,917
I know a good one.

486
01:04:10,584 --> 01:04:12,251
Come with me.

487
01:04:12,584 --> 01:04:17,042
I really hope your eyes get better

488
01:04:18,667 --> 01:04:20,834
so that you can write again.

489
01:04:22,917 --> 01:04:25,501
The handwriting's bad,

490
01:04:26,542 --> 01:04:29,876
but your recent writings are powerful.

491
01:04:35,667 --> 01:04:38,292
It won't be easy but can be cured.

492
01:04:38,292 --> 01:04:39,084
Really?

493
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:42,584
There's a cutting-edge treatment from England.

494
01:04:42,584 --> 01:04:46,334
We'll perform medication
for a month then surgery.

495
01:04:47,001 --> 01:04:51,459
The chances are not high but it's worth to try.

496
01:04:51,751 --> 01:04:53,084
Thank you so much.

497
01:05:24,542 --> 01:05:29,126
Happy birthday, Chungee. Make a wish!

498
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:32,459
I can see you are pulling a long face again.

499
01:05:36,584 --> 01:05:37,542
Professor.

500
01:05:38,751 --> 01:05:40,959
You should see the doctor tomorrow.

501
01:05:41,876 --> 01:05:44,459
- I'll go with you.
-Thanks.

502
01:05:48,334 --> 01:05:49,959
It's time for your medicine.

503
01:06:23,042 --> 01:06:24,376
How do you feel?

504
01:06:25,501 --> 01:06:27,709
I could see the shapes even though it's blurry

505
01:06:27,709 --> 01:06:30,042
with my left eye before.

506
01:06:30,542 --> 01:06:34,376
But now the dim contour only...

507
01:06:34,376 --> 01:06:35,709
Wait a second.

508
01:06:37,792 --> 01:06:39,001
How about now?

509
01:06:40,501 --> 01:06:42,834
I only see the black-ringed contour.

510
01:06:43,376 --> 01:06:44,584
It's all faint.

511
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:48,876
It's a routine reaction
to the medication treatment.

512
01:06:49,084 --> 01:06:51,959
We can now move on to the next step.

513
01:06:53,292 --> 01:06:54,834
You mean the operation?

514
01:06:58,459 --> 01:06:59,209
Yes.

515
01:06:59,334 --> 01:07:03,209
You'll see the whole bright world soon.

516
01:07:03,626 --> 01:07:04,876
Thank you.

517
01:07:06,126 --> 01:07:08,334
But how much does it cost?

518
01:07:09,084 --> 01:07:13,792
Will discuss it with your guardian.

519
01:07:20,459 --> 01:07:22,792
Why don't you tell me the cost? Is it that big?

520
01:07:22,917 --> 01:07:25,334
Let me find a way.

521
01:07:25,626 --> 01:07:29,167
You've spent most of money
to stop the foreclosure.

522
01:07:30,001 --> 01:07:31,084
Se-jung!

523
01:07:32,167 --> 01:07:33,709
Let's go to the gambling house.

524
01:07:36,292 --> 01:07:38,042
I need to relieve the stress.

525
01:07:38,251 --> 01:07:43,042
So please do as I ask. Now!

526
01:07:44,126 --> 01:07:45,834
I still got money.

527
01:07:45,834 --> 01:07:49,626
As you wish.

528
01:08:22,084 --> 01:08:25,042
- Diamond K, raise anyone?
-Raise one thousand.

529
01:08:25,251 --> 01:08:26,501
Raise one thousand.

530
01:08:28,292 --> 01:08:29,126
Fold.

531
01:08:29,126 --> 01:08:29,917
Go one thousand.

532
01:08:29,917 --> 01:08:32,501
One thousand received and one more, fold?

533
01:08:33,251 --> 01:08:36,626
- Fold. One thousand.
-Call.

534
01:08:37,084 --> 01:08:40,001
Call received. Will open the river.

535
01:08:40,709 --> 01:08:43,917
- Diamond 6. Raise?
-Raise one thousand!

536
01:08:43,917 --> 01:08:44,584
Raise one thousand.

537
01:08:45,501 --> 01:08:46,501
Raise one thousand.

538
01:08:46,501 --> 01:08:50,459
- Re-raise by 5 thousand.
-Re-raise, 5 thousand.

539
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:52,751
Call for 5 thousand?

540
01:08:54,542 --> 01:08:55,792
- Call!
-Call it is.

541
01:08:56,876 --> 01:08:58,084
Will open the cards.

542
01:09:00,126 --> 01:09:02,167
Luck is coming my way today.

543
01:09:14,542 --> 01:09:16,709
The room upstairs isn't open yet?

544
01:09:26,459 --> 01:09:27,751
Se-jung!

545
01:09:29,334 --> 01:09:30,334
Yes.

546
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:34,667
I think I can do anything today.

547
01:09:35,376 --> 01:09:38,917
I can earn the money for the operation
at one shot.

548
01:09:38,917 --> 01:09:41,626
It will be tens of thousand at most, right?

549
01:09:42,167 --> 01:09:46,042
You should go all the way on a day like today.

550
01:09:47,626 --> 01:09:51,834
All right, professor. Let's go crazy tonight.

551
01:10:20,376 --> 01:10:22,126
Open the cards.

552
01:10:45,626 --> 01:10:47,126
- Ten thousand.
-Call.

553
01:10:47,126 --> 01:10:48,626
- Call for ten thousand.
-Call.

554
01:10:51,959 --> 01:10:52,792
Fold.

555
01:10:55,792 --> 01:10:58,001
- Re-raise by 20 thousand.
-20 thousand

556
01:10:59,334 --> 01:11:00,167
Fold!

557
01:11:00,417 --> 01:11:01,959
Call for 20 thousand?

558
01:11:02,792 --> 01:11:03,917
Call!

559
01:11:09,167 --> 01:11:10,876
-20 thousand!
-20 thousand it is.

560
01:11:10,876 --> 01:11:13,126
I'll take a call and put all in.

561
01:11:15,501 --> 01:11:17,834
Call taken. Will open the cards.

562
01:11:32,417 --> 01:11:35,417
- Call the banker.
-Please stop.

563
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:37,501
I should get my money back.

564
01:11:38,667 --> 01:11:40,709
Where's the banker?

565
01:11:44,084 --> 01:11:45,751
"BOND OF DEBT"

566
01:11:45,751 --> 01:11:49,167
"AMOUNT: $90,000
AT MONTHLY RATE OF 45%"

567
01:11:53,209 --> 01:11:56,209
"DEBTOR: SHIM HAK-KYU"

568
01:11:56,209 --> 01:11:59,501
"DUE: SEPT. 30,2014"

569
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:19,834
Have some pancakes.

570
01:12:30,042 --> 01:12:31,417
Is it good?

571
01:12:36,417 --> 01:12:38,001
-Se-jung.
-Yes?

572
01:12:41,709 --> 01:12:43,792
You remind me of my mom.

573
01:12:45,417 --> 01:12:50,626
She was pretty but wrecked.

574
01:12:52,667 --> 01:12:54,792
She stayed in bed all day
because of depression.

575
01:12:57,167 --> 01:13:00,167
It wasn't just her fault, though.

576
01:13:01,084 --> 01:13:07,001
I guess you are what a mom should be.

577
01:13:08,459 --> 01:13:11,542
Sweet and tender.

578
01:13:13,417 --> 01:13:14,709
But!

579
01:13:17,751 --> 01:13:19,876
I don't want you to be my mom.

580
01:13:22,751 --> 01:13:26,959
Are you going to marry my dad?

581
01:13:31,459 --> 01:13:36,251
No, I am not.

582
01:13:40,126 --> 01:13:43,251
- What should I do?
-About what?

583
01:13:43,876 --> 01:13:45,459
The money.

584
01:13:47,417 --> 01:13:51,001
I could do anything if I can see things.

585
01:13:51,001 --> 01:13:52,917
I really want to see you, too.

586
01:13:57,376 --> 01:14:01,251
I can't imagine how terrible it must be

587
01:14:01,251 --> 01:14:03,292
if I were blind like you.

588
01:14:04,542 --> 01:14:09,792
But you don't have to worry.
You've got me and Chungee.

589
01:14:12,792 --> 01:14:18,001
Give me some time.

590
01:14:25,001 --> 01:14:27,251
I will find a way.

591
01:14:43,292 --> 01:14:44,626
Where's Chungee?

592
01:14:45,126 --> 01:14:47,126
She went to bed a while ago.

593
01:15:31,001 --> 01:15:31,792
Who's that?

594
01:15:33,667 --> 01:15:34,834
Is it Chungee?

595
01:15:37,084 --> 01:15:38,459
It was her, right?

596
01:15:38,501 --> 01:15:40,209
She saw us, didn't she?

597
01:15:44,292 --> 01:15:45,167
It should be okay.

598
01:15:46,501 --> 01:15:50,584
She'll understand if I tell her
we're going to get married.

599
01:15:51,584 --> 01:15:53,251
Of course, she will.

600
01:15:54,376 --> 01:15:56,292
How can't she?

601
01:15:57,667 --> 01:15:59,501
She's daddy's little girl.

602
01:16:08,001 --> 01:16:08,751
Who is it?

603
01:16:09,876 --> 01:16:11,542
It's banker Choi, professor.

604
01:16:12,501 --> 01:16:14,376
I'll come in for a bit.

605
01:16:18,542 --> 01:16:22,334
Your debt with a huge interest...

606
01:16:23,417 --> 01:16:24,876
What should we do?

607
01:16:25,084 --> 01:16:29,751
I can pay you back.
Just let me in some high games.

608
01:16:30,792 --> 01:16:35,834
Nonsense to pay your debt
by winning money gambling!

609
01:16:40,959 --> 01:16:43,209
You must be Chungee. Back from school?

610
01:16:44,834 --> 01:16:48,417
I'm your daddy's buddy. Don't be so guarded.

611
01:16:49,292 --> 01:16:51,417
You're much prettier in person.

612
01:16:51,417 --> 01:16:53,459
Go to your room.

613
01:16:56,709 --> 01:16:58,667
We should go, too.

614
01:16:59,001 --> 01:17:00,709
As the little one's back home.

615
01:17:01,917 --> 01:17:03,334
How old are you?

616
01:17:05,417 --> 01:17:06,834
I will see you around.

617
01:17:22,626 --> 01:17:24,126
Can't believe this!

618
01:17:24,417 --> 01:17:25,251
What?

619
01:17:27,042 --> 01:17:28,626
What is it?

620
01:17:32,584 --> 01:17:37,167
I'm so scared. I can't even go home.

621
01:17:38,542 --> 01:17:41,084
He's coming to our house every day.

622
01:17:42,167 --> 01:17:43,292
It's driving me crazy.

623
01:17:46,417 --> 01:17:48,751
Me and dad, what should we do?

624
01:17:48,751 --> 01:17:51,792
I would feel safer if you married him.

625
01:17:53,251 --> 01:17:58,334
Don't worry too much. Let me take care of this.

626
01:18:15,417 --> 01:18:19,334
What are you guys doing?

627
01:18:19,334 --> 01:18:22,042
You ruthless bastards.

628
01:18:22,042 --> 01:18:26,042
Are you okay, professor?

629
01:18:26,417 --> 01:18:28,501
What's all this about?

630
01:18:28,959 --> 01:18:31,542
I apologize, sir. Let him seated.

631
01:18:34,334 --> 01:18:39,084
My apology. They were so rude.

632
01:18:39,459 --> 01:18:41,959
What the hell were you doing?

633
01:18:42,417 --> 01:18:44,209
I'm really sorry.

634
01:18:45,501 --> 01:18:52,376
I have an idea to end all your troubles.

635
01:18:53,667 --> 01:18:56,417
Let's send Chungee to Japan.

636
01:18:58,709 --> 01:19:01,084
What're you talking about?

637
01:19:01,626 --> 01:19:02,876
No way.

638
01:19:03,542 --> 01:19:06,209
I will protect her whatever it takes.

639
01:19:06,209 --> 01:19:07,959
Let me finish first!

640
01:19:08,876 --> 01:19:10,667
Listen carefully.

641
01:19:11,001 --> 01:19:12,834
Consider it as the overseas training.

642
01:19:13,042 --> 01:19:15,251
All she needs to do is to talk
with the high-class clients.

643
01:19:15,251 --> 01:19:17,626
It could be a chance for her.

644
01:19:17,626 --> 01:19:20,959
Why don't you just kill me and sell my corpse?

645
01:19:20,959 --> 01:19:22,626
It could make you some money.

646
01:19:22,626 --> 01:19:25,126
What is the use of dying?

647
01:19:25,126 --> 01:19:28,001
Want to make a child an orphan?

648
01:19:28,542 --> 01:19:32,959
If you agree with my plan,
I can pay for your surgery.

649
01:19:35,001 --> 01:19:37,959
I can write novels.

650
01:19:38,417 --> 01:19:40,001
I'm a bestselling writer.

651
01:19:41,209 --> 01:19:42,542
Let me write a book for you.

652
01:19:42,542 --> 01:19:46,209
Whatever. Hold him!

653
01:19:46,376 --> 01:19:48,584
Please don't do this!

654
01:19:48,584 --> 01:19:51,334
You should cure your eyes first

655
01:19:51,792 --> 01:19:54,417
to bring your daughter back

656
01:19:54,417 --> 01:19:58,876
and see your pretty Chick's face.
Ain't it right?

657
01:20:01,251 --> 01:20:02,292
<i>I</i> got it!

658
01:20:02,584 --> 01:20:04,501
Son of a bitch!

659
01:20:04,876 --> 01:20:07,709
Why make things complicated
by resisting in vain?

660
01:20:07,709 --> 01:20:11,626
Take him home.

661
01:20:13,709 --> 01:20:15,209
Don't forget the money, sir.

662
01:20:15,209 --> 01:20:20,376
I will make you pay for it
when I have my sight back!

663
01:20:22,626 --> 01:20:25,334
Thanks to my money, you motherfucker!

664
01:20:43,251 --> 01:20:45,292
What happened to your face?

665
01:20:47,792 --> 01:20:50,209
Let me have the surgery with this money.

666
01:20:52,459 --> 01:20:54,501
What the heck did you do?

667
01:20:55,167 --> 01:20:57,501
This is way far from enough.

668
01:20:59,459 --> 01:21:01,876
I even released my bar for you.

669
01:21:08,417 --> 01:21:11,542
What are you talking about?

670
01:21:14,292 --> 01:21:15,501
Where's Chungee?

671
01:21:16,459 --> 01:21:18,792
Where's my girl?

672
01:21:19,501 --> 01:21:22,251
Chungee! My daughter!

673
01:21:31,167 --> 01:21:33,084
My poor little girl...

674
01:21:33,084 --> 01:21:35,126
Please, forgive your dad...

675
01:21:37,376 --> 01:21:38,626
Chungee...

676
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:03,126
Chungee...

677
01:22:30,709 --> 01:22:32,001
Are you awake?

678
01:22:32,501 --> 01:22:35,209
You'd better behave.

679
01:22:36,751 --> 01:22:38,376
You know what it is?

680
01:22:38,834 --> 01:22:43,667
It's a memo that your daddy sold you for money.

681
01:22:44,584 --> 01:22:46,126
You bastard must've threatened him!

682
01:22:46,626 --> 01:22:49,126
Watch your language.

683
01:22:49,417 --> 01:22:51,501
Didn't threaten anybody.

684
01:22:52,084 --> 01:22:55,959
He signed for the money to open his eyes again.

685
01:22:56,251 --> 01:22:58,209
It's a bullshit, scumbag!

686
01:22:58,584 --> 01:23:01,001
Watch your mouth, I warned you.

687
01:23:01,959 --> 01:23:04,376
Of course, it took him a while.
He's the father after all.

688
01:23:08,834 --> 01:23:12,459
How about Se-jung? How did you find me there?

689
01:23:12,709 --> 01:23:13,959
You mean Deokee?

690
01:23:15,876 --> 01:23:19,792
You naive little girl...

691
01:23:20,126 --> 01:23:23,626
Didn't you get suspicious at all

692
01:23:23,959 --> 01:23:28,376
when the new neighbor treated you too kind?

693
01:23:48,751 --> 01:23:51,042
I'm pretty excited.

694
01:23:54,959 --> 01:23:58,792
"6 MONTHS LATER"

695
01:25:22,084 --> 01:25:24,334
I made your favorite. Kimchi stew.

696
01:25:52,084 --> 01:25:55,126
You got a problem with my cooking?

697
01:25:55,792 --> 01:25:57,459
It tastes weird.

698
01:25:57,459 --> 01:25:59,709
You think I'll give you things not eatable?

699
01:26:01,126 --> 01:26:03,626
I'm working my hard ass off

700
01:26:05,001 --> 01:26:07,167
to take care of you.

701
01:26:08,709 --> 01:26:10,584
Be at least grateful.

702
01:26:13,209 --> 01:26:17,126
My bad. Let's not argue.

703
01:26:18,334 --> 01:26:20,792
Please help me wash myself instead.

704
01:26:35,417 --> 01:26:37,292
Got any news about Chungee?

705
01:26:41,417 --> 01:26:45,876
I had a baby.

706
01:26:46,334 --> 01:26:46,959
What?

707
01:26:49,542 --> 01:26:51,084
Where's your baby now?

708
01:26:54,417 --> 01:26:55,584
Dead.

709
01:26:57,876 --> 01:27:02,001
Because of its dad.

710
01:27:05,542 --> 01:27:08,334
I was just an innocent girl

711
01:27:10,751 --> 01:27:13,626
working at the small amusement park.

712
01:27:14,626 --> 01:27:16,834
I knew nothing about the world.

713
01:27:24,376 --> 01:27:26,542
Mom, do you love me?

714
01:27:26,542 --> 01:27:28,709
My mom couldn't speak,

715
01:27:29,459 --> 01:27:32,584
- But loved me dearly.
-I love you, too.

716
01:27:36,834 --> 01:27:38,834
That son of a bitch ruined everything!

717
01:27:40,459 --> 01:27:45,876
That bastard killed my unborn baby and my mom.

718
01:27:49,001 --> 01:27:50,626
Do you get it?

719
01:27:53,001 --> 01:27:55,001
You ruined everything!

720
01:27:56,042 --> 01:27:58,167
You destroyed my life, motherfucker!

721
01:28:02,417 --> 01:28:03,334
So

722
01:28:04,209 --> 01:28:05,209
it was you.

723
01:28:06,584 --> 01:28:09,376
I suspected...

724
01:28:11,834 --> 01:28:14,251
but wish it were never you.

725
01:28:19,751 --> 01:28:22,626
I went totally wrecked,

726
01:28:23,959 --> 01:28:26,792
but did whatever it took to survive.

727
01:28:28,834 --> 01:28:32,376
I swore that <i>I'll</i> make you go through
all the same.

728
01:28:33,667 --> 01:28:35,501
My resolution grew weaker,

729
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:38,834
but then I saw you.

730
01:28:40,459 --> 01:28:44,792
You didn't change a bit.
Still same selfish bastard!

731
01:28:46,084 --> 01:28:48,876
Do you know?

732
01:28:49,667 --> 01:28:50,792
You understand?

733
01:28:50,792 --> 01:28:53,584
How selfish you're? You know that?

734
01:29:02,459 --> 01:29:05,084
You're satisfied now?

735
01:29:15,834 --> 01:29:19,584
Your daughter is dead.
Couldn't even find the body.

736
01:29:20,042 --> 01:29:21,709
You caused it to yourself.

737
01:31:04,709 --> 01:31:05,876
Deokee.

738
01:32:05,501 --> 01:32:07,542
He can never see again

739
01:32:08,292 --> 01:32:10,501
unless he gets the transplant.

740
01:33:13,792 --> 01:33:17,001
My body and soul were completely
ravaged already.

741
01:33:19,042 --> 01:33:21,501
So I couldn't even feel the pain.

742
01:33:25,042 --> 01:33:28,834
But I wished she would stay
even if it's only to celebrate

743
01:33:30,959 --> 01:33:33,876
the fulfillment of her revenge.

744
01:34:12,251 --> 01:34:16,459
"HERE'S THE SECRET NOBODY KNOWS."

745
01:34:26,126 --> 01:34:29,084
Let's go get some fresh air.

746
01:34:30,667 --> 01:34:32,626
This is so beautiful.

747
01:34:37,709 --> 01:34:39,084
You're incredible, professor.

748
01:34:40,876 --> 01:34:43,209
Typing this perfect while
you cannot see anything.

749
01:34:44,251 --> 01:34:46,792
Also this is the best thing
you've ever written.

750
01:34:51,126 --> 01:34:54,834
Here's the secret nobody knows.

751
01:34:55,959 --> 01:34:58,584
I wander around the dim stars

752
01:34:58,959 --> 01:35:01,709
to reach out to your heart.

753
01:35:03,667 --> 01:35:05,667
I haven't finished it yet.

754
01:35:09,834 --> 01:35:13,376
Why couldn't you write this
when you had it all?

755
01:35:16,501 --> 01:35:19,376
Why do you write so good

756
01:35:19,709 --> 01:35:22,459
just when you're left helpless?

757
01:35:34,334 --> 01:35:35,459
Deokee!

758
01:35:36,667 --> 01:35:37,876
Miss me?

759
01:35:37,876 --> 01:35:41,292
Is that you, Chungee?

760
01:35:44,209 --> 01:35:45,126
My girl!

761
01:35:46,292 --> 01:35:47,376
Hi, dad.

762
01:35:48,626 --> 01:35:50,251
Nice sunglasses.

763
01:35:52,959 --> 01:35:54,959
I want to eat the pancakes.

764
01:35:55,584 --> 01:36:00,001
You don't know how much I missed your pancakes.

765
01:36:03,126 --> 01:36:04,542
It's great to be back.

766
01:36:05,751 --> 01:36:09,084
That old man asked me where I wanted to live.

767
01:36:09,334 --> 01:36:11,917
So I answered, 'With you!'

768
01:36:12,542 --> 01:36:15,417
Then he gave me one bill every day.

769
01:36:16,751 --> 01:36:18,334
Guess how much it was.

770
01:36:21,084 --> 01:36:22,167
One bill?

771
01:36:23,292 --> 01:36:24,334
One grand.

772
01:36:24,334 --> 01:36:26,542
I told him I don't need the money

773
01:36:26,542 --> 01:36:28,834
but just wanted to be with him.

774
01:36:30,417 --> 01:36:32,709
He asked me if I don't like money.

775
01:36:33,751 --> 01:36:36,292
I told him that I didn't care about the money

776
01:36:36,917 --> 01:36:39,709
but I did care the money he had.

777
01:36:41,209 --> 01:36:44,042
Then he flicked me on the forehead
with his finger.

778
01:36:45,126 --> 01:36:46,251
He's like a child.

779
01:36:48,251 --> 01:36:51,292
Are you listening to me?

780
01:36:52,417 --> 01:36:53,376
Sure.

781
01:36:55,376 --> 01:36:58,001
I missed this, so yummy!

782
01:36:58,001 --> 01:37:00,417
You guaranteed
she would never come out of there!

783
01:37:00,501 --> 01:37:02,584
The girl seemed to get out

784
01:37:02,584 --> 01:37:05,709
after paying off all her debt.

785
01:37:06,959 --> 01:37:10,709
Also she seems to be quite spiteful and strong.

786
01:37:12,417 --> 01:37:16,251
I guess it's time for you two spiteful women
to handle it yourselves.

787
01:37:27,876 --> 01:37:29,209
This scar...

788
01:37:31,959 --> 01:37:33,584
It's because of my dad, right?

789
01:37:36,959 --> 01:37:38,959
You paid back quite enough.

790
01:37:40,042 --> 01:37:42,209
Why do you still linger?

791
01:37:49,209 --> 01:37:51,334
You must've suffered much.

792
01:37:53,751 --> 01:37:59,084
As a sweet little girl just like I was
when I met you.

793
01:37:59,417 --> 01:38:02,709
I guess that's why you did all
that to me and dad.

794
01:38:03,417 --> 01:38:09,042
I even hoped you could be my mother.

795
01:38:09,167 --> 01:38:10,126
I...

796
01:38:10,667 --> 01:38:12,709
I suffered a lot too.

797
01:38:13,459 --> 01:38:15,709
I was near to death because of you!

798
01:38:18,459 --> 01:38:23,751
I'll give you back what you did to us.
Just same.

799
01:38:23,751 --> 01:38:25,126
Out Of my way!

800
01:38:31,084 --> 01:38:33,417
I told you not to come again.

801
01:38:35,459 --> 01:38:36,459
You should end what you started.

802
01:38:37,584 --> 01:38:39,042
Cut it off.

803
01:38:39,542 --> 01:38:43,417
I'm officially out of this.

804
01:38:44,251 --> 01:38:46,501
It's your battle to fight now.

805
01:38:48,917 --> 01:38:50,667
Brother, he's here.

806
01:38:59,042 --> 01:39:02,876
Sir, it's an honor to have you here.

807
01:39:06,042 --> 01:39:07,501
It's been a while.

808
01:39:08,042 --> 01:39:09,584
Please follow me.

809
01:39:24,042 --> 01:39:25,626
Come to the clinic right now!

810
01:39:25,626 --> 01:39:27,709
Got some strange visitors!

811
01:39:50,751 --> 01:39:52,209
I'm starving.

812
01:39:56,209 --> 01:40:02,501
You find all this funny?

813
01:40:34,959 --> 01:40:36,459
Deokee!

814
01:40:45,501 --> 01:40:48,209
What the hell are you doing?

815
01:40:50,584 --> 01:40:52,042
I told you...

816
01:40:53,209 --> 01:40:55,376
I will pay back exactly the same
you gave to us.

817
01:40:58,209 --> 01:41:03,376
I know that doctor helped you
make my dad blind.

818
01:41:06,584 --> 01:41:07,792
So?

819
01:41:12,876 --> 01:41:15,626
I think there's nothing you can do for now.

820
01:41:16,292 --> 01:41:19,376
You came too far.

821
01:41:21,126 --> 01:41:22,876
Don't blame me.

822
01:41:26,417 --> 01:41:31,417
Let me see him for once.

823
01:41:33,167 --> 01:41:34,501
You will.

824
01:41:37,501 --> 01:41:39,584
And dad will see you too.

825
01:41:41,626 --> 01:41:43,376
Through your eyes.

826
01:42:39,751 --> 01:42:41,876
Chungee said she brought the best doctors.

827
01:42:45,292 --> 01:42:47,292
We even took a walk together.

828
01:42:50,084 --> 01:42:54,126
She's changed a lot.

829
01:43:00,001 --> 01:43:04,584
I can't be with you anymore.

830
01:43:05,834 --> 01:43:07,001
Why not?

831
01:43:08,501 --> 01:43:13,251
I will get my job back and publish new book
after surgery.

832
01:43:14,042 --> 01:43:19,459
I feel really confident about my new book.

833
01:43:20,251 --> 01:43:21,376
Deokee!

834
01:43:25,417 --> 01:43:27,334
We can start all over.

835
01:43:28,792 --> 01:43:30,251
Please give me

836
01:43:31,917 --> 01:43:35,501
the second chance

837
01:43:36,959 --> 01:43:39,292
to make it up to you and Chungee.

838
01:43:39,292 --> 01:43:40,751
Don't say that!

839
01:43:44,084 --> 01:43:46,126
Don't act like a good man!

840
01:43:49,626 --> 01:43:51,709
You should stay as a jerk!

841
01:43:58,959 --> 01:44:04,626
You have to be the evil till the very end!

842
01:44:08,709 --> 01:44:09,959
I am really sorry.

843
01:44:20,209 --> 01:44:21,459
Professor.

844
01:44:25,209 --> 01:44:27,667
What was the thing we had then?

845
01:44:41,417 --> 01:44:43,167
It was love, too.

846
01:44:44,126 --> 01:44:46,542
But I had no other choice.

847
01:44:54,001 --> 01:44:55,959
Please forgive me.

848
01:44:58,251 --> 01:45:00,417
I hurt you too much.

849
01:45:06,084 --> 01:45:09,334
I am really sorry.

850
01:45:13,376 --> 01:45:17,459
I gave you too much pain.

851
01:46:14,292 --> 01:46:17,376
Deokee, let's go home now.

852
01:48:41,501 --> 01:48:44,959
I love you Deokee.
