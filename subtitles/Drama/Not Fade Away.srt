1
00:00:45,505 --> 00:00:46,673
<i>This is a test.</i>

2
00:00:46,756 --> 00:00:48,925
<i>For the next 60 seconds,
this station will conduct</i>

3
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:51,177
<i>a test of the
Emergency Broadcast System.</i>

4
00:00:51,261 --> 00:00:53,054
<i>This is only a test.</i>

5
00:01:17,162 --> 00:01:18,663
- Is that you?
- Hey.

6
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:21,583
Long time, huh?

7
00:01:21,666 --> 00:01:23,334
Still selling ice creams
off your bicycle?

8
00:01:23,418 --> 00:01:24,836
Bollocks.

9
00:01:25,462 --> 00:01:26,713
American R&B?

10
00:01:29,215 --> 00:01:31,092
Did you...
Did you nick them all?

11
00:01:31,176 --> 00:01:34,679
I sent off to Chicago.
You know, mail order?

12
00:01:35,263 --> 00:01:36,931
<i>I play that Little Queenie.</i>

13
00:01:37,015 --> 00:01:40,018
Still wearing out the stylus
on your mum's Philips, Keith?

14
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:42,937
Fuck, Mick.
I don't play it on the fucking hi-fi.

15
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:46,733
I got me a Rosetti steel-string.
DeArmond pickup.

16
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:51,696
Nice. I've been singing
a bit myself recently.

17
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,364
With ol' Dick Taylor.

18
00:01:53,448 --> 00:01:54,491
Is that right?

19
00:01:54,574 --> 00:01:55,742
You go for Jimmy Reed?

20
00:01:55,825 --> 00:01:57,035
"Baby, What You Want Me To Do."

21
00:01:57,118 --> 00:01:58,119
Yeah. Yeah.

22
00:01:58,203 --> 00:01:59,788
I love that song.

23
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:04,876
<i>This meeting took place</i>

24
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:07,212
<i>some 20 years after
the bombing of London</i>

25
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:09,047
<i>and the end
of World War II.</i>

26
00:02:09,798 --> 00:02:11,841
<i>We know what happened
to those two boys.</i>

27
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:15,136
<i>They became
The Rolling Stones.</i>

28
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:23,269
<i>A couple years after that meeting
on the train,</i>

29
00:02:23,353 --> 00:02:25,855
<i>my brother and his friends
also started a band.</i>

30
00:02:26,815 --> 00:02:29,901
<i>Not so many people know
what became of them.</i>

31
00:02:30,568 --> 00:02:35,073
<i>In fact, like with most bands,
you've never heard of them.</i>

32
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:46,125
Those black diamond Rogers
are cooler than shit.

33
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:48,002
Swiv-O-Matic hardware.

34
00:02:48,086 --> 00:02:50,505
This fucking guy I know
goes to Hancock Regional?

35
00:02:50,588 --> 00:02:52,257
He has a 6118.

36
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:54,175
That's where I fucking go.

37
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:57,095
I fucking go to
Delbarton Academy.

38
00:02:57,178 --> 00:02:58,263
Fucking eats shit.

39
00:02:58,346 --> 00:03:00,598
I'm fucking transferring
to Hancock senior year.

40
00:03:01,182 --> 00:03:02,267
What's your friend's name?

41
00:03:02,684 --> 00:03:03,685
Gene Gaunt.

42
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,186
Fuck, I know him!

43
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:07,021
He's like one of my
best friends this year!

44
00:03:07,522 --> 00:03:09,190
Him and me are in a band.

45
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:13,319
With Billy Schindewulf on drums.

46
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:42,640
Gaunt's double picking!

47
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:52,775
They're clapping on the on-beat.

48
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:54,652
Fags.

49
00:04:57,674 --> 00:04:59,258
<i>Preceding the hearse,</i>

50
00:04:59,342 --> 00:05:01,386
<i>a 13-man Marine Honor Guard,</i>

51
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:04,138
<i>their bayonets glinting in the glare
of camera lights.</i>

52
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:06,307
Not going to work today, Dad?

53
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,894
Carmine and me are deciding whether
to open the store.

54
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:13,940
Lots of businesses are closed.

55
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:15,942
Good. I'm happy for them.
They're so rich.

56
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:19,904
I saw my sister Louise
at the Celentano wake.

57
00:05:20,196 --> 00:05:21,239
She started right in.

58
00:05:21,614 --> 00:05:23,324
How I should find Ma a new doctor.

59
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:27,578
<i>Mrs. Kennedy rode
with her arm stretched across the coffin.</i>

60
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:29,706
<i>She was wearing
the same pink suit</i>

61
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:32,959
<i>that was spattered with blood
when the President was shot.</i>

62
00:05:33,042 --> 00:05:34,252
Had one of your
nightmares last night.

63
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:38,923
What the hell were you
hollering about this time?

64
00:05:39,007 --> 00:05:41,926
This colored boy was trying
to come up the lawn to get me.

65
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:51,019
The kids in schools in the south

66
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:53,563
stood up and cheered
when he got assassinated.

67
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:55,523
Don't believe everything
you hear.

68
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:56,566
No, you're right.

69
00:05:56,649 --> 00:05:59,318
Let's believe
"The heartbreak of psoriasis"

70
00:06:00,236 --> 00:06:03,364
and all those other commercials
you sell airtime for.

71
00:06:03,448 --> 00:06:04,824
Buick and those jerks.

72
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:07,035
The men who had
the genius and the daring

73
00:06:07,118 --> 00:06:09,287
to develop the Dynaflow
transmission... Kenneth.

74
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,497
...are jerks.

75
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:13,624
I'm going to volunteer
to go down there.

76
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:16,461
That's a crafty dodge from your
plunging grade point average.

77
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:19,255
How's the bird?

78
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:20,840
Happy Thanksgiving, Mother.

79
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:23,634
I think we got a bongo-drum
playing beatnik in our midst.

80
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:26,679
Stop it, you little fag!

81
00:06:26,763 --> 00:06:27,889
You're a fag!

82
00:06:27,972 --> 00:06:30,808
Stop toying with your
yams and sit up.

83
00:06:30,892 --> 00:06:32,518
The Southerners cheered
because President Kennedy

84
00:06:32,602 --> 00:06:34,228
wanted to pass voting laws
for colored people.

85
00:06:34,312 --> 00:06:35,730
Exactly, Gracie.

86
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:38,149
That is the precise reason
JFK went and garnered

87
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:40,485
such animus for himself
down in Dixieland.

88
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:41,569
Garnered such what?

89
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:44,489
Look it up,
Mrs. Allen Ginsberg.

90
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:52,371
<i>Clocks are made by men.
God creates time.</i>

91
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:55,291
<i>No man can prolong
his allotted hours.</i>

92
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:57,210
<i>He can only live
them to the fullest</i>

93
00:06:57,293 --> 00:07:00,129
<i>in this world or in
the Twilight Zone.</i>

94
00:07:00,213 --> 00:07:02,006
You can give this program
back to the Indians,

95
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:03,508
as far as I'm concerned.

96
00:07:03,591 --> 00:07:05,051
<i>- It's cool.
-Now, Mr. Serling.</i>

97
00:07:05,635 --> 00:07:07,887
<i>Next time, we enlist the aid
of a very talented scribe...</i>

98
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,932
There is a fifth dimension
beyond that known to man,

99
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:13,184
between light and shadow.

100
00:07:13,893 --> 00:07:17,313
At the end of the show,
nothing is ever what it seemed.

101
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:20,858
Real life's too much
like what it seems.

102
00:07:23,486 --> 00:07:26,364
Dad, this Army recruiter
who came to our school,

103
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:28,950
he said they got
a tank now, the M60,

104
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:31,285
can drive right through
a steel and concrete building.

105
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:32,328
<i>Maron.</i>

106
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,539
I want to go to a college
that has ROTC.

107
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:35,748
Keep your grades up.

108
00:07:35,832 --> 00:07:40,461
Achieving your goals
is 10% inspiration, 90% perspiration.

109
00:07:43,464 --> 00:07:44,632
Night.

110
00:07:45,174 --> 00:07:46,384
Good night.

111
00:07:52,557 --> 00:07:54,142
<i>It's hard to imagine now,</i>

112
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:58,479
<i>but the next historical event came only
three weeks after the assassination.</i>

113
00:07:58,563 --> 00:08:01,232
<i>Scott Muni, WABC.</i>

114
00:08:26,591 --> 00:08:28,259
What's that?

115
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:48,070
Hey, Bette.

116
00:08:50,615 --> 00:08:52,283
It's hot in here.

117
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:07,131
I know who he was looking at you.
He was, I swear.

118
00:09:45,127 --> 00:09:47,213
It's not just Grace Deitz.

119
00:09:47,296 --> 00:09:48,589
Chicks in general just...

120
00:09:48,673 --> 00:09:49,674
Wait, wait.

121
00:09:56,931 --> 00:09:59,767
Let's face it.
I'm a crap drummer.

122
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:01,352
I'm a shit athlete.

123
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:04,939
And that is the biggest sin,
if you're from around here.

124
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:10,528
He's right, man.
Jocks get 90, 95% of all the poontang.

125
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,657
You played varsity ball
till you got disallowed for grades.

126
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:17,076
The reason me and Wells
never asked you

127
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,953
to be in the band
is Schindewulf.

128
00:10:19,036 --> 00:10:21,038
The guy's got the fastest
bass-drum foot in the county.

129
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:25,543
I love her, man!

130
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:28,713
Hey, shut up!
You want to bring the cops here?

131
00:10:29,547 --> 00:10:32,383
Nothing has ever worked
for me with girls.

132
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:38,264
I got this skinny physique.
I got this skuzzy complexion.

133
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:45,915
<i>Rolling Stones.
Aren't they great?</i>

134
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,461
<i>They're gonna leave
right after the show for London.</i>

135
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:53,047
<i>They're challenging The Beatles
to a hair-pulling contest.</i>

136
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:09,230
What the fuck are
you doing, man?

137
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:11,524
My old man's going
to go fucking apeshit!

138
00:12:11,607 --> 00:12:13,567
<i>You see The Stones
on Hollywood Palace last night?</i>

139
00:12:13,651 --> 00:12:14,610
Yeah.

140
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:15,986
This definitely decides it.

141
00:12:16,237 --> 00:12:18,739
I'm starting a band like them
and The Beatles.

142
00:12:18,823 --> 00:12:20,491
Wells is in.

143
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:23,661
You want to play drums?

144
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:27,623
What about Schindewulf?

145
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:29,792
He's doing so putrid at school,

146
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,378
his old man's making him
join the Marines.

147
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:33,546
And when our record comes out,

148
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:34,839
he's got to be available
to go on tour.

149
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:36,382
England, whatever.

150
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:40,010
Anyway, I need someone
to back me up on vocal.

151
00:12:40,094 --> 00:12:42,763
When we fuck around making fun
of those songs on the radio,

152
00:12:42,847 --> 00:12:43,806
you sound pretty good.

153
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:46,100
Isn't Wells going to sing?

154
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:49,937
He sucks, man.
He's got a putrid voice.

155
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:58,654
Don't tell Wells I said that
about his voice.

156
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:04,160
You know what's interesting?

157
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:08,372
<i>How Charlie Watts beefed up
the Bo Diddley on Not Fade Away.</i>

158
00:13:08,456 --> 00:13:09,623
Like...

159
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:14,712
<i>He brought it front and center like
in Bo Diddley itself</i>

160
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:16,464
rather than Buddy Holly.

161
00:13:22,178 --> 00:13:26,724
Two chords. And no changes.
It's like percussion.

162
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:41,739
# Bo Diddley bought his babe
a diamond ring

163
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:45,868
# If that diamond ring don't shine

164
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:50,414
# He gonna take it to a private eye

165
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,877
# If that private eye can't see

166
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:59,423
# He'd better not take the ring from me

167
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:35,960
# Mojo come to my house,
ya black cat bone

168
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:40,631
# Take my baby away from home

169
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:45,302
# Up in that fo' door, where you been?

170
00:14:47,805 --> 00:14:50,266
# Up your house and gone again

171
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:54,562
# Bo Diddley, Bo Diddley,
have you heard?

172
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:59,733
# My pretty baby said
she wasn't for it

173
00:15:00,401 --> 00:15:02,945
We sat around for
two damn months

174
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:05,447
waiting for that battle of Anzio.

175
00:15:07,741 --> 00:15:12,079
See, them Jerrys, they had us
pinned down with those 88's.

176
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:14,915
You're such a retarded driver.

177
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:19,420
That lieutenant in Italy, he told us,

178
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,464
he said,
"Any of you colored troopers

179
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:24,258
"tamper with these
local women,

180
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:26,135
"you gonna be hung
on the spot."

181
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:30,764
I must have got the clap
from all that clapping I was doing

182
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:33,809
when the generals passed by
in their command car.

183
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:40,357
Anyway, you're going away
to college next week.

184
00:15:40,608 --> 00:15:43,444
You wanna make sure you
keep your dick powdered.

185
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,370
Happy Thanksgiving,
Earth people!

186
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:48,300
This is what I pay that goddamn
college $2,000 a year for.

187
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:51,720
There's people with
longer hair than me.

188
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:53,138
Fags.

189
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:57,059
Look at the coat.

190
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:59,103
Looks like he just got off
the boat at Ellis Island.

191
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:00,938
What?

192
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:13,367
He kills himself down at
that store six days a week,

193
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:15,160
plus Friday till 9:00,

194
00:17:15,411 --> 00:17:19,331
with that psoriasis.
And this is what you do?

195
00:17:33,262 --> 00:17:35,264
I will play just the one song.

196
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:38,684
Leave 'em wanting more.

197
00:17:41,145 --> 00:17:42,146
One second!

198
00:17:57,578 --> 00:17:58,662
Dial.

199
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:09,131
<i>Ivory.</i>

200
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:15,137
Colgate Palmolive.

201
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:18,140
What does that mean?

202
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,225
I left my roach clip at Oberlin.

203
00:18:20,476 --> 00:18:21,560
What's a roach clip?

204
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,146
Fuck the roach clip. Here.

205
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:28,484
Watch how we do things
at Steinholz Academy.

206
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:31,069
Get creative.

207
00:18:45,334 --> 00:18:46,710
Come on in there! I got to go!

208
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:49,546
Flush it down the john!
Our futures could be ruined!

209
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:50,631
Waste not, want not.

210
00:18:50,714 --> 00:18:51,965
Come on! Whoever's in there!

211
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:53,383
Don't get so uptight, man.

212
00:18:57,805 --> 00:18:59,473
Come on, already!

213
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:01,642
This is so unfair.

214
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:16,156
What do you mean,
he went home?

215
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,575
The popular girls only came here
to see the band.

216
00:19:19,701 --> 00:19:22,162
We can't do the song
without our lead singer.

217
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:23,789
I should have just
listened to Dave Smith.

218
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:25,666
He said he wanted
to bring his band over.

219
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,417
They do all John Lennon.

220
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:34,883
I'm into advanced time
signatures, 5/4, 6/8...

221
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:36,802
Will you just play the song?

222
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:39,054
I told you I'd give
you a box of M-80s.

223
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:44,601
Everybody! Let's hear it
for the Gene Gaunt Band.

224
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:48,981
Wait. Wait. No.

225
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:52,484
One, two, three.

226
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:01,869
Wait. Wait.

227
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,248
You suck sour owl shit!

228
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:14,339
What's this crap?
He's not the lead singer of the band.

229
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:21,138
# Time is on my side

230
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:22,556
# Yes, it is

231
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:28,645
# Time is on my side

232
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:30,814
# Yes, it is

233
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:34,902
# Now you always say

234
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:38,864
# That you wanna be free

235
00:20:39,323 --> 00:20:42,367
# But you'll come running back

236
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:46,246
# You'll come running back

237
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:50,167
# You'll come running back

238
00:20:51,043 --> 00:20:53,503
# To me

239
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:54,671
Easy!

240
00:20:56,214 --> 00:21:00,552
# Time is on my side

241
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:02,304
# Yes, it is

242
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:08,018
# Time is on my side

243
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:10,020
# Yes, it is

244
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:14,524
# You're searching
for good times

245
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:18,028
# But just wait and see

246
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:21,865
# You'll come running back

247
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:26,203
# You'll come running back

248
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:29,748
# You'll come running back

249
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:33,543
# To me

250
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:38,423
# Go ahead, baby.
Go ahead.

251
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:41,593
# Go ahead and light
up the town.

252
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:45,806
# And, baby, do anything
your heart desires.

253
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:46,890
# 'Cause you know

254
00:21:47,641 --> 00:21:49,893
# I'll always be around.

255
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:53,814
# And I know, I know,

256
00:21:55,232 --> 00:21:58,068
# like I told you so
many times before,

257
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:00,737
# you're gonna come
back to me, baby.

258
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:04,282
# Come back,
knocking on my door.

259
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:10,998
# Time, time,
time is on my side

260
00:22:11,164 --> 00:22:12,541
# Yes, it is

261
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:19,131
# Time, time,
time is on my side

262
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:27,639
Yeah!

263
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:31,476
You suck sour owl shit!

264
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,561
Jocks, go home!

265
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,385
<i>A bientot!
See you Monday.</i>

266
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:10,265
Bye!

267
00:23:14,019 --> 00:23:15,479
Happy Thanksgiving,
everybody.

268
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:17,105
Easy for you to say.

269
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:20,067
- Who won?
- Hancock,

270
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,902
131107.

271
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:24,529
The new coach, he's a lollapalooza.

272
00:23:28,158 --> 00:23:30,077
Thanksgiving at
Aunt Louise's is nice,

273
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,369
but why don't we have
everybody over here

274
00:23:31,453 --> 00:23:32,454
for some holiday?

275
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:36,750
In that postage stamp
of a dining room?

276
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,960
Yeah, there are
a lot of people.

277
00:23:39,336 --> 00:23:41,838
My sisters are
as free as birds.

278
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:46,009
They don't have to work. I do.
It's nice, too, isn't it?

279
00:23:46,551 --> 00:23:49,679
They know that,
but they have me bring the antipasto.

280
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:51,473
Think the Army's gonna
let you drive tanks

281
00:23:51,556 --> 00:23:53,391
dressed like a fruit?

282
00:23:56,353 --> 00:23:57,604
The Army?

283
00:23:58,772 --> 00:24:00,690
Why would I want
to join that?

284
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:01,942
What the hell you
talking about?

285
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:03,110
We had a whole conversation.

286
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:05,987
When?

287
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:14,037
Vietnam is ridiculous.

288
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:15,122
What did you say?

289
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:20,418
Plus, this friend of mine,
he said that in World War ll

290
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:23,213
they threatened black soldiers
with hanging

291
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,881
for looking at white women.

292
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:26,675
Why would I want
to be associated

293
00:24:26,758 --> 00:24:28,885
with an institution like that?

294
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:30,762
Look at him. High heels.

295
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:33,140
They're Cuban heels.

296
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:34,683
You wanna wear Cuban heels,
go live in Cuba.

297
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,227
They have nothing
to do with Castro.

298
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,353
They're nigger shoes!

299
00:24:38,436 --> 00:24:39,980
- Pasqual!
- Don't "Pasqual" me.

300
00:24:40,063 --> 00:24:41,481
He looks like he just
got off the boat!

301
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:43,150
You already said that.

302
00:24:46,153 --> 00:24:47,529
That hurt!

303
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:51,199
Let me tell you something,
my friend.

304
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:55,412
One day, you and me,
we're going to tangle.

305
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:57,998
Go ahead. Try it.

306
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:02,169
You want me to try it?

307
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:04,296
You left and went to college,
now you're a tough guy?

308
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:05,881
<i>I'll try it.</i>

309
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:07,716
Stop it! Both of you!

310
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:11,011
Don't make me use
my judo moves, man!

311
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:12,429
I want to kill myself!

312
00:25:13,847 --> 00:25:15,390
My shirt!

313
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:45,712
Be careful not to
track any snow in.

314
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:47,255
Hi, Grace.

315
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:53,178
<i>I'm not content
to be with you in the daytime</i>

316
00:25:55,805 --> 00:26:00,227
<i>Girl, I want to be
with you all of the time</i>

317
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,561
Oh, hey.

318
00:26:02,979 --> 00:26:05,315
- I really like your dress.
- Thanks.

319
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:08,652
- Did you get it for Christmas?
- Yeah, from my mother.

320
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:11,988
- It's nice.
- The music's neato.

321
00:26:13,323 --> 00:26:14,491
I'm going to check
out the band.

322
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:15,575
Great party.

323
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:17,827
# All day and all of the night

324
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:22,749
# I believe that you
and me last forever

325
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:28,630
# Oh, yeah, all day
and nighttime yours

326
00:26:28,713 --> 00:26:30,215
# Leave me never

327
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:38,181
# The only time I feel all right
is by your side

328
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:44,813
# Girl, I want to be with you
all of the time

329
00:26:44,896 --> 00:26:47,107
# All day and all of the night

330
00:26:48,566 --> 00:26:50,860
# All day and all of the night

331
00:26:59,869 --> 00:27:01,913
It's too fucking cold.
Let's go inside.

332
00:27:01,997 --> 00:27:03,832
Yeah. Okay.

333
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:07,460
She may not be coming
back to school next year.

334
00:27:07,544 --> 00:27:10,797
Are you serious?
Where is she gonna go?

335
00:27:11,089 --> 00:27:13,216
- I don't know. Rutgers?
- Really?

336
00:27:13,383 --> 00:27:15,302
That grass seemed
kind of weak.

337
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:23,101
You smoke a lot at Vassar?

338
00:27:23,518 --> 00:27:25,687
This guy from Harvard
I was dating, he did.

339
00:27:26,646 --> 00:27:27,897
Harvard?

340
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:31,109
The guy liked that place?

341
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:34,029
I guess.
He's an adjunct professor.

342
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:36,573
Medieval Persian poetry.

343
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:44,748
Your basement is cool.

344
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:47,667
That.

345
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:49,252
Yeah.

346
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:52,672
So, what, you're not going out
with that guy anymore?

347
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:53,923
The Persian guy?

348
00:27:54,215 --> 00:27:57,761
He's not Persian.
That's not what I said.

349
00:28:06,853 --> 00:28:08,271
How come you never
talked to me in high school?

350
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:11,107
We talked.

351
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:13,485
Miss Vogel's class?

352
00:28:13,943 --> 00:28:17,530
Once. You said something
about the pencil sharpener.

353
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:22,577
I really liked you.

354
00:28:23,286 --> 00:28:24,746
- Yeah, I know.
- You knew that?

355
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:26,414
Fucking Wells.

356
00:28:26,998 --> 00:28:28,625
He didn't say anything.

357
00:28:31,211 --> 00:28:32,670
You like Wells,
don't you?

358
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:37,300
My parents and his mother
belong to the club.

359
00:28:38,301 --> 00:28:39,886
Anyway, he likes this
girl at Oberlin.

360
00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:41,721
But you like him, don't you?

361
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:43,556
He's funny.
He makes me laugh.

362
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:50,230
- You have a good voice.
- Pardon?

363
00:28:51,189 --> 00:28:54,234
Thanksgiving at Karen's house,
when you sang lead?

364
00:28:54,317 --> 00:28:57,112
The band sounded more
soulful than tonight.

365
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,240
I hope that doesn't
piss you off.

366
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:03,326
Anyway,
it's just my opinion.

367
00:29:07,664 --> 00:29:09,040
You guys don't have
a name yet?

368
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:10,333
Wells' latest idea:

369
00:29:10,917 --> 00:29:13,253
He wants to call us
the Lord Byrons.

370
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,050
He's got a lot of say.

371
00:29:19,717 --> 00:29:24,722
He's an art genius,
trades off lead guitars, keyboards.

372
00:29:30,854 --> 00:29:32,021
Time is on your side.

373
00:29:50,623 --> 00:29:53,334
<i>If you are at home
when a surprise attack occurs,</i>

374
00:29:53,418 --> 00:29:55,503
<i>crawl beneath
a table if it is very near.</i>

375
00:29:56,087 --> 00:29:58,631
<i>Or drop to the floor
with your back to the window.</i>

376
00:30:05,096 --> 00:30:07,849
<i>The immediate danger
is over in about a minute.</i>

377
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:10,602
<i>The ball is moving!
Five! Four!</i>

378
00:30:11,102 --> 00:30:14,230
<i>Three! Two! One!</i>

379
00:30:15,565 --> 00:30:17,859
Happy New Year!

380
00:30:29,537 --> 00:30:32,790
He won't even call me!

381
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:35,793
I'm so sorry.
Let's go upstairs.

382
00:30:36,586 --> 00:30:38,671
He won't even call me!

383
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,261
You're gonna be all right.

384
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:09,118
<i>Submitted for
your approval,</i>

385
00:31:09,202 --> 00:31:10,745
<i>one Max Phillips.</i>

386
00:31:10,954 --> 00:31:13,665
<i>A slightly worse-for-wear
maker of book</i>

387
00:31:13,957 --> 00:31:15,625
<i>who is soon to
discover that man is</i>

388
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:18,086
<i>not as wise as he thinks,
said lesson</i>

389
00:31:18,294 --> 00:31:20,088
<i>to be learned in
the Twilight Zone.</i>

390
00:31:51,661 --> 00:31:53,705
Grace went to the Little Falls diner
with some people.

391
00:31:54,247 --> 00:31:55,999
I was just looking
for a bathroom.

392
00:31:56,541 --> 00:31:58,418
Could you help me with this?

393
00:32:11,681 --> 00:32:13,182
Robert Johnson.

394
00:32:14,183 --> 00:32:16,269
I so dig Chicago blues.

395
00:32:16,352 --> 00:32:18,354
That's all we played
during Freedom Summer.

396
00:32:18,438 --> 00:32:21,316
Delta blues.
Chicago's electric.

397
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,652
- You were down there?
- Voter registration.

398
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:26,404
Cool.

399
00:32:30,074 --> 00:32:33,077
Did she say who she was
going to the diner with?

400
00:32:34,704 --> 00:32:36,372
Would you like to watch
my sister eat?

401
00:32:36,706 --> 00:32:37,874
No.

402
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:41,878
I don't get it.

403
00:32:42,712 --> 00:32:44,672
How come the English
knew all about the blues

404
00:32:44,756 --> 00:32:46,132
and we didn't?

405
00:32:46,215 --> 00:32:48,384
Yet it's been right here
under our nose the whole time.

406
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:51,846
I've seen Gracie
make a poop,

407
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:53,473
if that holds any
interest for you.

408
00:32:58,144 --> 00:32:59,145
Lead Belly.

409
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:05,109
"Jump down, turn around,
pick a bale of cotton."

410
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:07,236
We sang this stuff in
elementary school.

411
00:33:07,904 --> 00:33:10,031
Huddie Ledbetter and Lead
Belly were the same person?

412
00:33:15,203 --> 00:33:16,704
I'm moving. The Village.

413
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:22,210
This is a series on Dad.

414
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,005
This paint

415
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:30,385
represents his blood
by way of whiskey sours.

416
00:33:31,803 --> 00:33:32,887
His summer favorite.

417
00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:35,932
Yeah.

418
00:33:41,979 --> 00:33:43,356
<i>This is Murray the K.</i>

419
00:33:43,439 --> 00:33:47,443
<i>This meeting of the Swinging
Soiree is now in session!</i>

420
00:33:53,366 --> 00:33:54,492
Look.

421
00:34:13,302 --> 00:34:15,096
What the hell is that?

422
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:16,180
It's a UFO.

423
00:34:16,556 --> 00:34:19,308
It can't be a UFO.
It's completely stationary.

424
00:34:21,394 --> 00:34:23,146
It's a three.

425
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:26,315
It's an omen.

426
00:34:26,816 --> 00:34:28,317
No, it's an S.

427
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:30,111
He's right.
It looks like an S.

428
00:34:31,195 --> 00:34:32,780
It's an S and a three.

429
00:34:35,408 --> 00:34:38,077
It means success for
the three of us!

430
00:34:39,495 --> 00:34:41,330
Holy fucking shit!

431
00:34:46,836 --> 00:34:49,464
# I've rolled and I tumbled

432
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:52,341
# I cried the whole night long

433
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:59,348
# I got up this morning

434
00:34:59,557 --> 00:35:02,685
# Feelin' that something
gone wrong

435
00:35:15,448 --> 00:35:17,200
The band sounds good.

436
00:35:21,037 --> 00:35:23,039
Which do you think is better?

437
00:35:23,915 --> 00:35:26,459
Our songs that are more bluesy

438
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:29,045
or more melodic?

439
00:35:38,221 --> 00:35:40,223
When you sing with Gene,

440
00:35:40,723 --> 00:35:45,269
your voice seems
to make the songs work.

441
00:35:57,698 --> 00:36:00,284
So, your sister...

442
00:36:02,036 --> 00:36:03,788
She's so outrageous.

443
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:10,336
I know you look up to her and all,

444
00:36:11,546 --> 00:36:14,131
but I don't think
you think it's going so good.

445
00:36:28,521 --> 00:36:34,277
# Well, baby, I ain't gonna
eat out my heart anymore

446
00:36:34,694 --> 00:36:38,531
# I ain't gonna eat out
my heart anymore

447
00:36:52,837 --> 00:36:55,172
It's time to chip in,
cut the demo.

448
00:36:55,256 --> 00:36:57,383
I can't believe it costs
200 fucking dollars.

449
00:36:57,466 --> 00:37:00,219
If we're not ready for the studio now,
we never will be.

450
00:37:00,303 --> 00:37:02,889
Man, that is such a cliche.

451
00:37:03,431 --> 00:37:05,141
Why do people say that?

452
00:37:06,434 --> 00:37:08,686
Whether or not one is ready
at any given point in time

453
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:10,229
has nothing to do

454
00:37:10,313 --> 00:37:11,689
phenomenologically with

455
00:37:11,772 --> 00:37:14,066
whether one might be
increasingly ready later.

456
00:37:14,942 --> 00:37:17,236
Maybe we could
be more ready.

457
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,905
Maybe Van Gogh wasn't ready
to cut off his ear

458
00:37:18,988 --> 00:37:19,989
and if he'd waited...

459
00:37:20,156 --> 00:37:21,991
I think I can sing
that song better.

460
00:37:23,492 --> 00:37:24,702
What?

461
00:37:28,414 --> 00:37:30,416
I think I can sing that song
better than you.

462
00:37:35,546 --> 00:37:37,340
Actually, I agree.

463
00:37:38,716 --> 00:37:40,635
Actually, I think that goes
for most of our songs.

464
00:37:40,718 --> 00:37:43,387
Look, man,
the session's costing us $200.

465
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,642
He's got a better voice
than you. Sorry.

466
00:37:51,437 --> 00:37:53,147
He can lay down drums
on a separate track.

467
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,815
All of a sudden you
care about money?

468
00:37:54,899 --> 00:37:56,692
You don't even
have to work.

469
00:37:58,027 --> 00:37:59,528
And you never bought
one fucking guitar pick

470
00:37:59,612 --> 00:38:01,614
-for this band.
- You are uptight!

471
00:38:01,864 --> 00:38:03,699
We're talking about Damiano
singing lead,

472
00:38:03,783 --> 00:38:06,160
not about familial wealth.

473
00:38:06,661 --> 00:38:08,412
I don't really see the logic.

474
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:14,835
Okay.

475
00:38:23,302 --> 00:38:25,179
Nah, it's not okay.

476
00:38:26,305 --> 00:38:28,307
I don't want to do this demo
if it's just gonna be shit.

477
00:38:35,398 --> 00:38:36,691
Not shit.

478
00:38:38,192 --> 00:38:39,276
You know what I mean.

479
00:38:53,874 --> 00:38:54,917
Hello?

480
00:38:56,002 --> 00:38:57,003
Hi.

481
00:38:58,337 --> 00:38:59,588
Hey.

482
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:09,473
- How's your cellar?
- What?

483
00:39:15,646 --> 00:39:18,524
The other night, you said
your cellar was flooded.

484
00:39:23,362 --> 00:39:24,613
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

485
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:55,311
All right, let's stop.
Take it from the top.

486
00:40:16,332 --> 00:40:18,250
# Yeah!

487
00:40:18,918 --> 00:40:21,712
# You can get any
man you want going

488
00:40:21,796 --> 00:40:22,922
# And you do it

489
00:40:23,005 --> 00:40:26,217
# And don't say
you don't know that you do

490
00:40:28,552 --> 00:40:34,683
# Well, baby, I ain't gonna
eat out my heart anymore

491
00:40:35,684 --> 00:40:37,311
# So quit it

492
00:40:40,356 --> 00:40:44,193
# I love you,
I love you I do, girl

493
00:40:45,152 --> 00:40:48,656
# But you ain't gonna
cheat on me

494
00:40:49,824 --> 00:40:53,077
# I need you,
I need you I do, girl

495
00:40:53,536 --> 00:41:00,417
# Choose, is it him or me?

496
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:04,964
# Yeah!

497
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:07,716
# You better watch
your step or, girl

498
00:41:07,883 --> 00:41:10,553
I thought the tall kid
was gonna sing backup.

499
00:41:15,141 --> 00:41:21,230
# Well, baby, I ain't gonna
eat out my heart anymore

500
00:41:21,564 --> 00:41:25,609
# I ain't gonna eat out
my heart anymore

501
00:41:26,277 --> 00:41:30,698
# I ain't gonna eat out
my heart anymore

502
00:41:32,324 --> 00:41:33,701
Got to admit, that's pretty good.

503
00:41:34,493 --> 00:41:36,162
Did you hear the A side
where I sang the lead

504
00:41:36,245 --> 00:41:37,705
on the Arthur "Big Boy"
Crudup tune?

505
00:41:37,788 --> 00:41:38,873
Yeah.

506
00:41:39,665 --> 00:41:42,084
I didn't like that as much.

507
00:41:43,627 --> 00:41:45,296
Hey.

508
00:41:45,379 --> 00:41:47,256
Yo, Schindewulf!

509
00:41:47,464 --> 00:41:50,426
<i>Have you seen the
Return of the Magnificent Seven?</i>

510
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:53,220
- Guillermo!
- Eugenio!

511
00:41:55,014 --> 00:41:56,515
- Dave Smith.
- Hey, Billy.

512
00:41:56,599 --> 00:41:58,684
I was saying, where
are you stationed?

513
00:41:58,767 --> 00:42:01,270
The Da Nang sector.
I can't divulge the base location.

514
00:42:01,437 --> 00:42:03,314
Hey, somebody said that
you were in the Marine Band

515
00:42:03,397 --> 00:42:04,607
down at the White House.

516
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:06,525
I tested out to D.M. school.

517
00:42:06,609 --> 00:42:08,485
- You don't play drums
anymore? - No.

518
00:42:09,695 --> 00:42:10,905
What's D.M. school?

519
00:42:10,988 --> 00:42:12,823
I got a scholarship
to BM. school.

520
00:42:14,366 --> 00:42:16,327
I produce such immense logs.

521
00:42:20,831 --> 00:42:23,459
Distinguished Marksman.
I'm a sniper.

522
00:42:25,252 --> 00:42:27,838
Remington model 700,
7.62 millimeter.

523
00:42:27,922 --> 00:42:29,256
All right.

524
00:42:31,383 --> 00:42:32,718
You kill guys with
that thing?

525
00:43:10,089 --> 00:43:12,341
<i>Have you forgotten
your old friend?</i>

526
00:43:13,467 --> 00:43:14,927
<i>I told you we were closed.</i>

527
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:16,804
<i>I'm Hank Quinlan.</i>

528
00:43:19,223 --> 00:43:21,558
<i>I didn't recognize you.</i>

529
00:43:22,017 --> 00:43:24,436
<i>You should lay off
those candy bars.</i>

530
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:28,732
<i>It's either the candy
or the hooch.</i>

531
00:43:29,858 --> 00:43:33,404
<i>I must say, I wish it was your
chili I was getting fat on.</i>

532
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:37,241
<i>Anyway, you're
sure looking good.</i>

533
00:43:38,409 --> 00:43:39,952
<i>You're a mess, honey.</i>

534
00:43:40,369 --> 00:43:41,578
<i>Yeah.</i>

535
00:43:42,705 --> 00:43:45,708
<i>That pianola
sure brings back memories.</i>

536
00:44:16,905 --> 00:44:18,782
Look at this fucking guy.

537
00:44:19,366 --> 00:44:20,617
Fore!

538
00:44:23,287 --> 00:44:25,289
Now that's some
funny shit, man.

539
00:44:25,706 --> 00:44:26,957
Look at this guy.

540
00:44:29,585 --> 00:44:33,922
Watching Dr. King on the TV, leading
that march in Chicago?

541
00:44:35,257 --> 00:44:37,426
- Did you see that, Leon?
- Shit, yeah.

542
00:44:37,634 --> 00:44:39,386
They threw stones at him.

543
00:44:39,928 --> 00:44:41,055
Damn!

544
00:44:42,598 --> 00:44:44,558
It was hard to get up
and come to work today.

545
00:44:45,059 --> 00:44:46,935
Had those bullfrogs
on your mind.

546
00:44:47,728 --> 00:44:48,729
What?

547
00:44:48,937 --> 00:44:52,900
"Woke up this morning,
had those bullfrogs on my mind."

548
00:44:54,276 --> 00:44:56,612
- I don't follow you.
- Blind Willie McTell.

549
00:45:02,618 --> 00:45:04,078
When you're
singing the blues,

550
00:45:05,954 --> 00:45:08,123
the lyric line often starts,

551
00:45:08,207 --> 00:45:09,792
"Woke up this morning."

552
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:12,836
Then life just comes
and fucks you over, right?

553
00:45:13,629 --> 00:45:16,590
I don't sing blues.
I'm a deacon at my church.

554
00:45:18,634 --> 00:45:21,053
Like that
Son House tune, man.

555
00:45:21,303 --> 00:45:24,223
"Woke up this morning,
had those Statesboro blues.

556
00:45:24,306 --> 00:45:26,183
"Looked over in the corner,
sister had 'em, too."

557
00:45:26,266 --> 00:45:28,435
You want to hear
some gorgeous blues

558
00:45:28,519 --> 00:45:31,814
you need to listen
to Duke Ellington or Tony Bennett.

559
00:45:32,106 --> 00:45:35,067
Tony Bennett?
He's Italian.

560
00:45:39,321 --> 00:45:41,323
What kind of movie is this?

561
00:45:42,658 --> 00:45:44,034
Nothing happens.

562
00:45:45,327 --> 00:45:47,871
And there's no
orchestra to tell you,

563
00:45:47,955 --> 00:45:50,749
like, "Watch out,
this guy's going to get killed."

564
00:46:02,553 --> 00:46:04,680
I think the trees
are the music.

565
00:47:21,256 --> 00:47:22,799
Capezios.

566
00:47:23,133 --> 00:47:24,551
Neat.

567
00:47:26,845 --> 00:47:28,472
Pas de bourree.

568
00:47:30,307 --> 00:47:31,517
Plie.

569
00:47:33,352 --> 00:47:34,895
My little swan.

570
00:47:34,978 --> 00:47:37,147
Here, Dad. For you.

571
00:47:37,231 --> 00:47:39,858
I told you I wasn't giving you
anything for Christmas,

572
00:47:39,942 --> 00:47:41,235
and I didn't want
anything from you.

573
00:47:45,531 --> 00:47:47,282
He's quitting college.

574
00:47:47,491 --> 00:47:49,076
So I told him I wasn't
getting him anything

575
00:47:49,159 --> 00:47:50,619
and I didn't want
anything from him.

576
00:47:50,702 --> 00:47:51,703
Oh, Pat.

577
00:47:51,787 --> 00:47:54,122
I need to devote my full
time to the band.

578
00:47:56,458 --> 00:47:58,168
Christmas. Big deal.

579
00:47:58,835 --> 00:48:00,712
It's Jesus' birthday!

580
00:48:00,796 --> 00:48:03,966
He's probably blowing out the
candles right now in Vietnam,

581
00:48:04,049 --> 00:48:07,094
plus the lives of about
40,000 children.

582
00:48:07,177 --> 00:48:09,137
Don't talk like that.

583
00:48:09,263 --> 00:48:10,973
You don't like it,
go live in Red China.

584
00:48:11,056 --> 00:48:12,891
I went down to Newark
for the pastries for today.

585
00:48:13,225 --> 00:48:15,060
The Fabias got a new
colored housing project

586
00:48:15,143 --> 00:48:16,311
going up right across
the street.

587
00:48:16,603 --> 00:48:17,896
Nobody built free housing

588
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:19,314
for the Italians when
we had nothing.

589
00:48:20,399 --> 00:48:21,775
All Mama and Papa gave
each of us for Christmas

590
00:48:21,858 --> 00:48:23,360
was a navel orange.

591
00:48:23,527 --> 00:48:24,861
That's all they could afford.

592
00:48:27,322 --> 00:48:29,199
What I want to know,
Douglas MacArthur,

593
00:48:29,283 --> 00:48:30,492
what are you gonna
do about the draft

594
00:48:30,576 --> 00:48:31,702
without a student deferment?

595
00:48:31,785 --> 00:48:32,911
What are you gonna do,
tiptoe through the tulips

596
00:48:32,995 --> 00:48:33,996
down there at the
draft board?

597
00:48:34,663 --> 00:48:36,582
He's going to loaf
with that Eugene Gaunt.

598
00:48:36,665 --> 00:48:39,501
Yeah, well, Mom, you wouldn't
understand being in a band.

599
00:48:39,626 --> 00:48:40,711
That's my true family.

600
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:51,930
Your true family, there,
they're gonna pay

601
00:48:52,014 --> 00:48:53,599
your enormous food bills,
I assume.

602
00:48:57,477 --> 00:48:59,146
I told you I'm going
to get a job.

603
00:48:59,229 --> 00:49:01,023
Doing what?
Ditch digger and philosopher

604
00:49:01,106 --> 00:49:02,107
the rest of your life?

605
00:49:02,441 --> 00:49:03,609
Just till we make it.

606
00:49:03,692 --> 00:49:05,402
<i>Let me call The Red
Skelton Show right away.</i>

607
00:49:05,527 --> 00:49:07,654
Make sure they got a dressing
room stocked with delicacies.

608
00:49:10,115 --> 00:49:12,159
You're so hung up
on this, man.

609
00:49:12,242 --> 00:49:13,827
Why don't you just hire
me at the store?

610
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:14,911
Looking like that?

611
00:49:14,995 --> 00:49:17,039
You look like you just
got off the boat!

612
00:49:18,498 --> 00:49:19,958
Dougie, come on,
your dinner!

613
00:49:20,042 --> 00:49:21,126
Why bother feeding him?

614
00:49:21,209 --> 00:49:24,087
He's cannon fodder
for the Army in Vietnam!

615
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,602
I know you already have it,

616
00:49:39,061 --> 00:49:42,481
but you said that Joy
always steals your records

617
00:49:42,564 --> 00:49:44,608
and gets paint
and cream cheese on them.

618
00:49:51,531 --> 00:49:52,741
I love you.

619
00:49:53,033 --> 00:49:54,076
I love you.

620
00:50:00,916 --> 00:50:02,417
Happy New Year.

621
00:50:07,923 --> 00:50:10,884
Movie, Long Island champagne,

622
00:50:10,967 --> 00:50:12,260
heater, if we need it.

623
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:16,098
This is better than our
own little house.

624
00:50:21,937 --> 00:50:23,897
<i>When you find
this Mr. Perfect,</i>

625
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,148
<i>does he get some
kind of award?</i>

626
00:50:41,748 --> 00:50:44,876
The thing is,
with this apartment now,

627
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,920
I'm going to need
bread to pay rent.

628
00:50:49,214 --> 00:50:51,007
Grace was saying that

629
00:50:51,258 --> 00:50:54,386
their milkman's nephew
has this band that plays

630
00:50:54,594 --> 00:50:56,722
at this bar down in Asbury.

631
00:50:56,972 --> 00:50:59,975
The Jersey shore
is all Four Seasons people.

632
00:51:00,058 --> 00:51:01,643
They wouldn't understand
what we do.

633
00:51:01,768 --> 00:51:03,228
More and more
greasers nowadays

634
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:04,646
are not combing it back.

635
00:51:05,063 --> 00:51:06,231
Grace was saying that...

636
00:51:06,314 --> 00:51:09,317
Look, man, there's something
I need to rap with you about.

637
00:51:09,401 --> 00:51:10,527
They should really
put more than

638
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:12,320
one of these fat
blobs in each can.

639
00:51:12,863 --> 00:51:15,407
Yeah, that's definitely where
it's at with baked beans.

640
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:18,285
On the other hand,
it's a treat to wait for it.

641
00:51:18,368 --> 00:51:19,745
The beans themselves
are pretty boring.

642
00:51:19,828 --> 00:51:21,079
Yeah, okay.

643
00:51:23,665 --> 00:51:24,750
Look.

644
00:51:25,834 --> 00:51:27,085
The summer
after high school,

645
00:51:27,169 --> 00:51:29,838
actually,
right through that year,

646
00:51:30,338 --> 00:51:31,631
Grace Deitz was blowing me.

647
00:51:37,345 --> 00:51:39,681
She used to blow
De Souza, too.

648
00:51:40,515 --> 00:51:42,058
I know this for a fact.

649
00:51:44,352 --> 00:51:45,395
Did he fuck her?

650
00:51:46,855 --> 00:51:47,939
I don't know.

651
00:51:48,356 --> 00:51:50,233
But anyway,

652
00:51:50,609 --> 00:51:52,444
getting back to me,

653
00:51:53,111 --> 00:51:57,866
I didn't fuck her.
But she did blow me regularly.

654
00:51:58,283 --> 00:52:00,535
And I thought you
should know because,

655
00:52:00,619 --> 00:52:04,164
A, in the future, we'll face
a lot of stresses and strains

656
00:52:04,247 --> 00:52:08,710
what with magazine shoots,
press conferences, etcetera.

657
00:52:08,877 --> 00:52:12,088
Look, man, she's stone free
to do as she please.

658
00:52:13,048 --> 00:52:14,090
<i>Exactamente.</i>

659
00:52:14,591 --> 00:52:18,345
Especially concerning
outdated sexual mores.

660
00:52:34,402 --> 00:52:37,155
There's one more
piece of fat.

661
00:52:39,241 --> 00:52:40,909
<i>Gracias, man.</i>

662
00:52:42,035 --> 00:52:45,163
Look, this had to be done,
me telling you this.

663
00:52:45,455 --> 00:52:46,623
For the good of the band.

664
00:52:47,749 --> 00:52:51,211
Better you found out now
than after we made it.

665
00:52:52,254 --> 00:52:55,340
The last thing we need
is an Anita problem

666
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:58,093
like you hear about
with Keith and Brian.

667
00:52:59,553 --> 00:53:01,012
He's my best friend.

668
00:53:01,263 --> 00:53:02,597
Some best friend
who tells you that.

669
00:53:02,764 --> 00:53:03,765
So it is significant.

670
00:53:04,015 --> 00:53:06,518
A minute ago,
it was just part of the sexual revolution.

671
00:53:06,601 --> 00:53:08,854
Right. Things have
really changed.

672
00:53:08,937 --> 00:53:12,065
Yeah, I know. I'm cool.
Now things have changed.

673
00:53:12,148 --> 00:53:13,733
But you were blowing
him in late '64,

674
00:53:13,817 --> 00:53:14,901
which by my calculations

675
00:53:15,026 --> 00:53:17,279
means that Christmas break
party at your house.

676
00:53:17,362 --> 00:53:18,905
Nobody in Hancock
was rapping about

677
00:53:18,989 --> 00:53:20,699
any fucking sexual
revolution then.

678
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:22,534
You know that as well as I.

679
00:53:22,617 --> 00:53:23,660
You must have blown him
the night you told me

680
00:53:23,743 --> 00:53:24,744
time was on my side.

681
00:53:26,788 --> 00:53:28,498
He's trying to drive
a wedge between us

682
00:53:28,582 --> 00:53:30,375
because I give you
my opinions on the band.

683
00:53:30,458 --> 00:53:31,710
Holy fuck! I'm right!

684
00:53:31,793 --> 00:53:32,919
It was a long time ago,

685
00:53:33,128 --> 00:53:35,630
and, frankly,
it's none of your business.

686
00:53:35,714 --> 00:53:37,132
You blew De Souza,
too, didn't you?

687
00:53:37,257 --> 00:53:38,884
- I know this for a fact.
- Fuck you, man.

688
00:53:39,593 --> 00:53:41,511
How am I supposed to not think
about that when we're kissing?

689
00:53:41,595 --> 00:53:43,388
I don't know!
Think of toothpaste!

690
00:53:44,389 --> 00:53:46,057
You had intercourse
with my sister.

691
00:53:46,141 --> 00:53:48,310
I could've freaked out over that,
but we weren't together then.

692
00:53:48,393 --> 00:53:50,186
I didn't have intercourse
with your sister.

693
00:53:50,270 --> 00:53:52,022
You're a liar.
Why would she make it up?

694
00:53:52,105 --> 00:53:53,106
She's insane?

695
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:56,067
Don't you call her insane.

696
00:53:56,151 --> 00:53:57,485
You were up in her room,
drinking.

697
00:53:57,569 --> 00:53:58,653
You didn't go in
there to ball her?

698
00:54:01,656 --> 00:54:04,242
No. You're fucking amazing.

699
00:54:04,326 --> 00:54:06,202
High school, it's the
jocks you go after.

700
00:54:06,286 --> 00:54:07,829
Then Wells,
'cause he's lead guitar,

701
00:54:07,913 --> 00:54:09,581
and now me,
'cause I'm lead singer.

702
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:15,337
Is that what you think?

703
00:54:16,379 --> 00:54:17,380
That's your M.O.

704
00:54:18,506 --> 00:54:19,716
I believe in you.

705
00:54:24,346 --> 00:54:25,347
God...

706
00:54:26,014 --> 00:54:28,975
What was I thinking?
You're a small person.

707
00:54:30,518 --> 00:54:32,646
You were in high school,
and you still are.

708
00:54:32,729 --> 00:54:34,230
Exactly! High school.

709
00:54:34,314 --> 00:54:36,399
Once a conceited bitch,
always a conceited bitch.

710
00:54:39,694 --> 00:54:42,030
I thought we were best friends.

711
00:54:49,162 --> 00:54:50,747
Look, he told you
for the good of the band.

712
00:54:52,332 --> 00:54:54,834
I want to leave
this fucking world.

713
00:54:54,918 --> 00:54:56,836
Fucking A, man!

714
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,546
Dave Smith gets signed
to Elektra Records.

715
00:54:59,923 --> 00:55:01,257
Dave's writing original songs.

716
00:55:01,383 --> 00:55:02,384
Really?

717
00:55:02,926 --> 00:55:04,928
I keep telling you guys!
Andrew Oldham!

718
00:55:05,303 --> 00:55:07,472
The Stones,
he locked them in a room...

719
00:55:07,555 --> 00:55:09,599
And got Jagger and Richards
to write their own songs.

720
00:55:09,683 --> 00:55:11,101
Doing covers is
a thing of the past.

721
00:55:11,184 --> 00:55:12,602
Except,
they had two huge hits.

722
00:55:12,978 --> 00:55:16,189
<i>Not Fade Away, Buddy Holly.
It's All Over Now...</i>

723
00:55:16,856 --> 00:55:19,401
Two hits? I need this
to be my career.

724
00:55:22,404 --> 00:55:23,405
Shame on you, man.

725
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:26,491
Need is like peasants
starving in Southeast Asia.

726
00:55:26,741 --> 00:55:28,326
Nobody needs a career!

727
00:55:28,785 --> 00:55:31,037
I think we should all
move to the East Village,

728
00:55:31,121 --> 00:55:32,747
get an apartment there.

729
00:55:33,456 --> 00:55:36,251
Corky Curto went to the
East Village the other night.

730
00:55:36,334 --> 00:55:38,920
Sees a guy beating his dog
to death with a baseball bat.

731
00:55:39,004 --> 00:55:40,255
Corky goes over
to intervene.

732
00:55:40,672 --> 00:55:41,881
The dog was a rat!

733
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:44,384
There's a music scene
there, not here.

734
00:55:51,558 --> 00:55:52,684
Look, I don't want to
lord this over you,

735
00:55:52,767 --> 00:55:54,352
but I've been, like, the main
music figure in this town

736
00:55:54,436 --> 00:55:55,437
since high school.

737
00:55:55,520 --> 00:55:56,688
I feel like I owe it
to the people to remain...

738
00:55:56,771 --> 00:55:58,815
What the fuck are
you two doing?

739
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:05,196
I feel like I owe it
to the people

740
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,115
to remain loyal
to our roots.

741
00:56:07,657 --> 00:56:09,743
Celebrity has responsibilities.

742
00:56:14,289 --> 00:56:16,041
<i>In June, 1967,</i>

743
00:56:16,124 --> 00:56:17,250
<i>The Beatles released</i>

744
00:56:17,333 --> 00:56:19,627
Sergeant Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band.

745
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:22,505
Dominic, I'd like you
to meet my son, Orlando.

746
00:56:22,839 --> 00:56:25,592
Pleasure to meet you, son.
We're all proud of you.

747
00:56:26,051 --> 00:56:27,510
<i>That summer is
known to history</i>

748
00:56:27,594 --> 00:56:29,471
<i>as the Summer of Love.</i>

749
00:56:47,781 --> 00:56:49,491
I got cancer.

750
00:56:53,203 --> 00:56:55,497
Mycosis fungoides.

751
00:56:56,498 --> 00:56:57,999
That's what he called it.

752
00:56:59,667 --> 00:57:04,172
Looks like psoriasis,
but it moves to the lymph glands.

753
00:57:10,303 --> 00:57:11,679
What's going to happen?

754
00:57:11,763 --> 00:57:13,890
Could be a year or two.

755
00:57:19,479 --> 00:57:22,482
I started writing some lyrics.

756
00:57:29,447 --> 00:57:31,991
I've been messing with
this progression.

757
00:57:44,212 --> 00:57:46,714
It's a little more McGuinn-ish
than what we usually do.

758
00:57:54,931 --> 00:57:56,558
That's right. There.

759
00:57:59,602 --> 00:58:02,230
# I had the cards
close to my vest

760
00:58:02,313 --> 00:58:04,607
# When the table
got kicked over

761
00:58:05,608 --> 00:58:07,110
# It's what you wanted

762
00:58:07,193 --> 00:58:10,613
# Though you thought nothing
and said even less

763
00:58:11,781 --> 00:58:14,117
# And now even your
carrier pigeons

764
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:17,203
# Have been picked
off by the vultures

765
00:58:18,454 --> 00:58:23,293
# There's only one thing
left for you to confess

766
00:58:23,459 --> 00:58:24,919
Last chorus. Here we go.

767
00:58:25,295 --> 00:58:29,966
# Am I still penciled in
on your calendar

768
00:58:30,967 --> 00:58:32,760
# Am I still the late night call

769
00:58:32,844 --> 00:58:35,972
# When you've got nothing to say

770
00:58:37,307 --> 00:58:42,312
# I know it's New Year's Eve
And you say you love me

771
00:58:46,482 --> 00:58:48,818
# Last lover standing

772
00:58:49,194 --> 00:58:51,112
In minor C this time.

773
00:58:51,487 --> 00:58:53,823
# Last lover standing

774
00:58:54,991 --> 00:58:58,328
# Who'll be the last
lover standing

775
00:58:58,995 --> 00:59:00,663
# On Saint Valentine's

776
00:59:01,831 --> 00:59:04,167
# Day

777
00:59:20,225 --> 00:59:21,643
You really wrote that?

778
00:59:22,852 --> 00:59:24,729
It sounds like an actual song.

779
00:59:30,026 --> 00:59:31,903
What'd you think, Eugenio?

780
00:59:33,529 --> 00:59:34,948
It was okay, I guess.

781
00:59:36,991 --> 00:59:40,245
What about the
other one? Sniper?

782
00:59:41,704 --> 00:59:42,997
It's about the war.

783
00:59:43,498 --> 00:59:45,541
How Schindewulf's old man
made him join up.

784
00:59:45,792 --> 00:59:47,710
It's like a protest song?

785
00:59:47,961 --> 00:59:49,545
It sucks.

786
00:59:55,426 --> 00:59:56,678
Later, alligator.

787
01:00:06,437 --> 01:00:08,690
Jesus Christ on the cross!

788
01:00:10,316 --> 01:00:12,318
These openings are
a tight squeeze.

789
01:00:12,402 --> 01:00:13,736
Bullshit!

790
01:00:17,365 --> 01:00:19,575
I told you not to let her
drive any of the vehicles.

791
01:00:20,576 --> 01:00:22,745
She comes out from the city,
pilfers all our

792
01:00:22,829 --> 01:00:24,372
toilet paper and provisions,

793
01:00:24,455 --> 01:00:26,165
and shears off
a goddamn mirror?

794
01:00:26,332 --> 01:00:27,667
She must be doing
it on purpose!

795
01:00:27,792 --> 01:00:28,876
Why would she do that?

796
01:00:31,963 --> 01:00:33,631
And what's with
wearing the plastic

797
01:00:33,715 --> 01:00:34,882
lemon juice applicators?

798
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:38,594
I don't know, Dad.
ReaLemon is one of your sponsors.

799
01:00:39,053 --> 01:00:40,555
Is your sister
taking this LSD?

800
01:00:43,933 --> 01:00:45,310
You better come
clean right now.

801
01:00:47,103 --> 01:00:48,146
No.

802
01:01:14,172 --> 01:01:15,840
This is Emile.

803
01:01:17,967 --> 01:01:18,968
What the hell is this?

804
01:01:20,136 --> 01:01:22,263
Yeah, that keeps happening.

805
01:01:24,098 --> 01:01:25,350
It's my strabismus.

806
01:01:25,433 --> 01:01:28,353
What are you talking about?
You're not cross-eyed.

807
01:01:28,436 --> 01:01:30,021
Well, how come
I keep seeing double then?

808
01:01:30,938 --> 01:01:32,857
Or quadruple if I want to?

809
01:01:34,942 --> 01:01:36,194
You walk barefoot
in New York City?

810
01:01:37,528 --> 01:01:41,324
Walking on gobs and chewing
gum and God knows what?

811
01:01:44,285 --> 01:01:47,121
# Train kept a-rollin'
all night long

812
01:01:47,205 --> 01:01:50,166
# Train kept a-rollin'
all night long

813
01:01:50,249 --> 01:01:53,127
# Train kept a-rollin'
all night long

814
01:01:53,211 --> 01:01:56,047
# Train kept a-rollin'
all night long

815
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:58,925
# With a heave and a ho

816
01:01:59,008 --> 01:02:02,011
# But I just couldn't let her go

817
01:02:19,862 --> 01:02:22,949
# Train kept a-rollin'
all night long

818
01:02:23,032 --> 01:02:25,910
# Train kept a-rollin'
all night long

819
01:02:25,993 --> 01:02:28,830
# Train kept a-rollin'
all night long

820
01:02:31,749 --> 01:02:33,584
The fireworks display
is tomorrow night

821
01:02:33,668 --> 01:02:35,628
for the parents.
Fuck that!
