00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,620
- Damn it!
- That's it!

32
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:14,860
What the hell do you think you're doing?

33
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,060
Witness! Witness!
Witness! Negligent!

34
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:21,260
- Sory.
- Sory doesn't make her chery again.

35
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:25,660
- Are you blind?
- You pulled into my spot. It's just a dent.

36
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,180
lt's not a big fucking deal!

37
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:32,820
lt's just a dent? Maybe on your car,
farmer, but on mine...

38
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:37,340
Nobody solved problems with violence.
That's what's wrong with the world.

39
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,740
Come on, break it up!

40
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:43,900
Stop it, this is so macho!

41
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:56,660
Hey, how are you doing? l'm...

42
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,220
- Get out of my room!
- Your room?

43
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,620
- This is my room!
- This is my room!

44
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,980
42, l'm afraid so.

45
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:12,980
- l don't believe this.
- Jesus!

46
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:29,460
OK, look, what if l apologise, OK?

47
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:34,460
You're right, it was my fault. l'm sory.
Really, OK? No hard feelings.

48
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,140
Why fight if it was your fault?

49
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:41,900
First impressions are important.
l slink out of my car and say,

50
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:47,260
''Here l am, folks. Say hi to a total
asshole''? No. l stand up for myself.

51
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:52,620
- l create doubt as to whose fault it was.
- That's what you were doing?

52
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:57,300
l got the dented car, not you.
It's no skin off your nose.

53
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,420
- Eveybody makes out, right?
- Wrong.

54
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:06,260
First law school, then you become a
sleazebag with no regard for the truth.

55
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,100
- l've met guys like you before.
- Yeah?

56
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:16,020
You got that face, got that smile,

57
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,940
got that corduroy suit
that comes with elbow patches.

58
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,900
You got one of those suits?

59
00:07:31,579 --> 00:07:33,100
So what?

60
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:38,620
Just curious.

61
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:41,620
- Which is 42?
- Over there.

62
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:46,060
Tim! Garrity, come on.
You can run but you can't hide.

63
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:51,060
Stubblefield? You dog, l heard an ugly
rumour you were going to be here.

64
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:54,420
Tim Garrity,
you'll never amount to anything.

65
00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:01,180
- Your mother and l are disappointed.
- You'll have to ty harder, that's all.

66
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:03,940
- How you doing?
- Great. You?

67
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:07,220
- BJ said there was a fight. See it?
- No...

68
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:12,020
Yeah, a guy got what was coming
to him and will live in shame for ever.

69
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,900
- l'm sory l missed it...
- Sory, Doug Stubblefield, Peter Burton.

70
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:22,700
Good to know you. l got a keg on ice,
you won't believe who's here, so let's go.

71
00:08:22,899 --> 00:08:24,180
l'll be there.

72
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:28,900
- Anyone you want to ask?
- Girls? The place is crawling with them.

73
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:33,940
lf you want, l can go and see
about changing rooms.

74
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:35,860
l'd understand.

75
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:44,380
l got a colour N and subscriptions
to Tíme and Natíonal Geographíc.

76
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:49,620
Three credit cards and a guy
at Hialeah phones me sure things.

77
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,900
- l'm Tim Garrity.
- Peter Burton.

78
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,740
- Want to come to Stubblefield's?
- No, don't want to butt in.

79
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,660
Come on. He's a jerk, all right,
so consider it punishment.

80
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,420
- Come on.
- OK.

81
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,180
- Where are you from?
- Providence, Rhode Island. You?

82
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:14,420
All over. We moved around a lot.

83
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,620
- College?
- Georgetown. You?

84
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,700
UConn.

85
00:09:20,779 --> 00:09:24,980
lgnorantía jurís non excusat.

86
00:09:25,179 --> 00:09:28,700
''lgnorance of the law is no excuse.''
Robinson versus Virginia.

87
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:34,260
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
who can give me the facts of the case?

88
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,940
Mr Burton.

89
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:42,380
Proximate cause.
Train conductor pushes a passenger.

90
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:48,100
Guy's carying firecrackers. Falls to the
ground. Exploding, injuring bystander.

91
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:49,980
Foreseeability?

92
00:09:50,179 --> 00:09:54,300
The railroad company couldn't foresee
the box containing fireworks

93
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,780
or that their employee's actions
could cause injuy.

94
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,380
The reasonable man's standard?

95
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:05,260
Foreseeability and proximate cause
make for a reasonable man?

96
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:12,540
We may not always get what we want
or what we need,

97
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,500
just so's we don't get
what we deserve.

98
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:24,900
- So her parents were down the hall?
- We're not fucking in the living room!

99
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,900
l wouldn't imply anything as base and
vulgar as that. Let me get this straight.

100
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,980
lt's breakfast. You're sitting with
Senator and Mrs Stiles.

101
00:10:34,179 --> 00:10:40,620
The happy millionaires eat breakfast,
Diana's there, apple of Dad's eyes...

102
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,100
Stamford.

103
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:45,780
He pulls those telegenic blue eyes
on you and says what?

104
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,980
- Good morning.
- You're missing something.

105
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:53,060
- What do you do at a girlfriend's?
- They're not senators' daughters.

106
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,980
- Where are you going?
- London, in fact.

107
00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:00,140
My parents are in Geneva.
Some World Bank thing.

108
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,500
Christmas in London?
Plum pudding and Marley's ghost.

109
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:09,860
lt's mostly Arabs and rain. l'm flying
into New York. Want to get together?

110
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:13,140
The Stiles throw this famous
New Year's Eve party.

111
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:18,460
l want you to meet Diana.
Here, let me give you the number.

112
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:23,220
Nobody has a pen in this situation.
What a guy!

113
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:28,220
- Hey, don't forget your stuff.
- Mery Christmas!

114
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,980
Three turkey white.

115
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:57,500
Two turtle doves...

116
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,700
And a partrídge ín a pear tree

117
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,300
1 7.84.

118
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:20,180
- You really got to go?
- l still got some presents to buy.

119
00:12:20,379 --> 00:12:23,340
Believe it or not.
Talk about last minute.

120
00:12:23,539 --> 00:12:27,180
Plus, l promised my sister-in-law
l'd make the desserts.

121
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:32,740
l'd ask you to come, but it's iust family.

122
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,900
Sory.

123
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,500
l hate to see someone alone
on Christmas Eve.

124
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,020
- Will you be OK?
- l'll be fine.

125
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,540
Mery Christmas.

126
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,180
And they síng of Chrístmas.
Bah, humbug!

127
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:09,940
Míght as well close shop for the níght.
We'll fínísh tomorrow.

128
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:12,980
But, sír, tomorrow ís Chrístmas Day.

129
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:06,060
- Tim! Pete.
- Hey, how are you doíng?

130
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:09,940
- Good. How are you?

131
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:14,500
- Great. It snowed and eveything.

133
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:24,540
l was wondering if l could stop in
and say hi.

134
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,460
Come up here New Year's Eve.

140
00:15:29,019 --> 00:15:30,300

- You want a tux at 9 a.m.?
- Why would l call you at home?

142
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,620

- l'm starving.

146
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,660
Diana, can you get your father?

147
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:18,540
- Have you seen my father?
- No.

148
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,860

150
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:32,340
- ...not the doctors...
- Burt, you're wrong. You're full of shit.

151
00:17:32,539 --> 00:17:38,220
The AMA has got to realise people
don't give a rat's ass about that,

152
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,580
when a simple appendectomy
costs $6,OOO.

153
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:47,980
Where does it say Congress answers
to the AMA and not to their electorate?

154
00:17:50,619 --> 00:17:53,980
- l'm sory l interrupted.
- It's all right. Go on.

155
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,220
People don't want
AMA deciding on health

156
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,540
any more than E_on
running the Interior Department.

157
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:06,060
You ever been
on an AMA golf outing, son?

158
00:18:07,259 --> 00:18:10,460
- No, Senator.
- Well, take Dr Tuck here.

159
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:14,060
He'll fix your bursitis,
sharpen up your short game,

160
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,620
wipe out your campaign debt
before you're off the first green.

161
00:18:17,819 --> 00:18:19,420
Yes, Senator.

162
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:25,020
You're right. You're there to represent
the people who elected you.

163
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:30,540
But to do that you've got to get elected,
and that takes money.

164
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:34,620
So, evey day you ty to remember
where you drew the line.

165
00:18:34,819 --> 00:18:39,820
- What's your name?
- Peter Burton. l'm at UVA with Tim.

166
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:44,260
- Nice to meet you, Peter.
- It's an honour.

167
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,380
Now that you've given me indigestion,
Burt, let's eat.

168
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,540
Finally! l'm starving.

169
00:18:55,619 --> 00:19:00,980
You did fine. l'm John Lawy.
l'm an aide to the senator.

170
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:06,740
Peter Burton. l was iust reading
your profile in the Washíngtonían.

171
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,580
- Just?
- Just recently.

172
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:14,140
The article was in
a year and a half ago.

173
00:19:14,339 --> 00:19:17,140
Some stack in the libray.

174
00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:20,780
You prepare for eveything
the way you prepare for parties?

175
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,940
John, let's get something to eat.

176
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,860
Could you pass these around?

177
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:44,100
Peter! A special hat for you.
Looks good.

178
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:01,740
- Bathroom's there.
- Just wanted to get out of the crowd.

179
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,900
Have you seen Tim?

180
00:20:04,099 --> 00:20:07,700
Deep into it with some guy from Justice.

181
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:13,340
That's not ''some guy''.
That's the Deputy Attorney General.

182
00:20:15,259 --> 00:20:19,940
lt's like the Natíonal Revíew
come to life in there.

183
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:24,260
And are you impressed by that?

184
00:20:26,779 --> 00:20:28,820
Yes, l am.

185
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:36,820
- How was London?
- Oh, great. Fantastic.

186
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:40,740
- You went to school there?
- l've still got lots of friends there.

187
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,220
Shuttle them in for the party?

188
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,420
- You don't remind me of James Dean.
- What?

189
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:48,820
You remind Tim of James Dean.

190
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:51,700
lf James Dean was a graduate grind.

191
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,860
Tim likes to make the basically boring
glamorous. No offence.

192
00:20:56,059 --> 00:20:58,260
- None taken.
- There you are.

193
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:01,580
Give me the last kiss of '83.

194
00:21:01,779 --> 00:21:06,580
l haven't seen that much log-rolling
since my father's poker games.

195
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:08,140
What's log-rolling?

196
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:12,860
Compromising the duties of office
under the guise of expediency.

197
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:15,740
Government by cheques and cocMails.

198
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:20,660
- A system that's worked for 200 years.
- l said nothing about your dad.

199
00:21:20,859 --> 00:21:23,420
- Don't start.
- One mínute to got

200
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:27,180
- Resolutions?
- Find a good margarita in Georgetown.

201
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,340
- Cop out!
- You?

202
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:33,220
- Too young and powerless to mention.
- OK, next decade?

203
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:36,380
Prosecuting half the guest list.

204
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,100
To be in Congress within 1 O years.

205
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:45,740
- That's it?
- But l mean it.

206
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,020
- Is this expensive?
- About $80.

207
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,500
l'll make a bet with you.

208
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:54,620
Election night '90. If l win,
you each owe me a bottle, by hand.

209
00:21:54,819 --> 00:21:57,540
- If not?
- l'll bring you a case.

210
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:01,900
Just send mine. l won't want to be
around you the day after you lost.

211
00:22:02,099 --> 00:22:04,700
Happy New Year!

212
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,740
Happy New Year, Pete.

213
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,580
Happy New Year!

214
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,460
My turn, Tim.

215
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,500
- What's wrong with this party?
- Who told you about it?

216
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,660
l smoked a ioint with the caterer.

217
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:36,020
lt's drug-induced? Can we drive
around for hours looking for a diner?

218
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,900
Usher in the New Year with adults
and you'll become one.

219
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:43,380
- Where is this joint?
- Over by Bridgeport.

220
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:55,060
- Here we are.
- This looks shitty.

221
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:57,900
- Let's go to Greenwich.
- It's worse.

222
00:22:58,099 --> 00:23:02,100
- One drink.
- We won't stay long, l promise.

223
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:06,260
They've written ''Party'' three times
on the marquee. How bad can it be?

224
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,300
- They've clearly pulled out all the stops.
- OK, OK!

225
00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:34,060
Two draughts, two shooters of Jack
and a Baileys.

226
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:36,060
- Jack?
- Yeah.

227
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:42,100
Browns for my friend.
No, Browns for my friend.

228
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,220
Petey Bertkowski?
Is that Petey Bertkowski?

229
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:52,060
Jesus! Out of my way!
Coming through! Out of my way!

230
00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:56,980
Bertkowski! Petey Bertkowski! Jesus!

231
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,100
Todd!

232
00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:03,780
- Short hair! It's been a long time.
- Yeah, a long time.

233
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:07,460
l saw your dad. l work for the city
and he worked with us.

234
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:10,580
A big snowstorm before Thanksgiving.

235
00:24:10,779 --> 00:24:13,220
- We're just leaving.
- Seen Janine?

236
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:17,140
- l know she'll want to talk to you.
- Say hi to her...

237
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:20,140
Baby! Janíne, honey!

238
00:24:20,339 --> 00:24:22,660
Baby! Janíne!

239
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:28,100
Come on! We're married now.
We got two kids and it's good.

240
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,900
Hey, Peter.

241
00:24:38,099 --> 00:24:43,060
Hey, Janine. You look good.

242
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,700
You, too. Different.

243
00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:01,300
Happy New Year.
It's good seeing you guys.

244
00:25:04,859 --> 00:25:08,300
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

245
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,860
Happy New Year. Let's belly up here.
Couple of beers!

246
00:25:40,099 --> 00:25:44,460
- Just don't judge me, OK?
- l don't even know your name.

247
00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:51,980
Peter Michael Bertkowski.

248
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:58,260
Born, New Haven, March 9 1959,
to Mike and Irene.

249
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:02,300
The mother left when he was ten.
The father, a Cutty Sark fan,

250
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,860
raised the boy, working sporadically
around the holidays.

251
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:08,900
People got the charitable urge.

252
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,100
Where were you Christmas?

253
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,460
School.

254
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:21,140
- Why did you lie to me?
- l thought you wouldn't be my friend.

255
00:26:21,339 --> 00:26:26,420
Why would you think that
l'd give a shit about stuff like that?

256
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:30,740
Most people don't see the world
with the same eyes you do.

257
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:35,140
They're not so sure who they are,
not so happy with who they are.

258
00:26:35,339 --> 00:26:39,060
You don't have to lie to me.

259
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:44,660
- You don't understand, man.
- Why don't you let me ty?

260
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,940
l'm sory, Tim.

261
00:26:56,339 --> 00:27:00,660
The thing is,
these personal traits of your father's,

262
00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:04,580
some you can't stand,
these come out in you.

263
00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:07,780
There's nothing you can do,
any more than you can

264
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,500
about getting his ears

265
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,660
or his hairline...

266
00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:17,460
You know, last weekend, right.

267
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:21,100
Diana, little thing.
Dinner before the movie.

268
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:27,860
Turns into a fight, no other reason
than me sticking to a goddamn plan.

269
00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:30,060
My father exactly.

270
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,580
How?

271
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:40,020
He ran his house the same way
he runs his courtroom:

272
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:43,180
confusing stubbornness with strength.

273
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:49,420
l knew what she meant.
Got even madder denying it.

274
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:53,060
Do you have any idea
what l'm talking about?

275
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:58,260
But you don't have
to become your old man.

276
00:28:00,859 --> 00:28:03,380
lt's not inevitable.

277
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,460
Not if you fight it with eveything you got.

278
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:22,300
- Hey, Tim. Timmy!
- Yeah?

279
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,820
- Mine came!
- You got it!

280
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,220
All right. OK, on three.

281
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:32,540
Good luck! One, two, three!

282
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:39,220
- OK. ''Department of Justice...''
- ''After a considerable number...''

283
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:44,340
- ''inform you of your acceptance...''!
- ''...staff of Senator James B Stiles''!

284
00:28:47,619 --> 00:28:49,140
Washington!

285
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:58,980
Yes. Look around. Here we are.

286
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:27,620
A lady writes, ''Dear Senator,
My Oscar is a great admirer of yours,

287
00:29:27,819 --> 00:29:31,900
''and evey time you come on the N
he sits in front to watch.

288
00:29:32,099 --> 00:29:36,820
''And when they applaud your speech
he barks right along.''

289
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:40,660
Oscar's her fucking dog!

290
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:42,940
Now, ''Oscar has been sick.

291
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:48,100
''Could the senator find time
to have a photograph taken with him?

292
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:51,140
''lt would mean so much, you know.''

293
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,980
Don't eveybody look at once.

294
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:12,260
Senator Frank Steubens with
an unidentified blonde. Laminated.

295
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,340
Jesus!

296
00:30:14,539 --> 00:30:17,420
- Jesus!
- She's a lobbyist.

297
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:20,980
America's family man toasted
with a blonde at Wah Fong's.

298
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:25,380
l like the papers on the table.
Nice touch. Working dinner.

299
00:30:25,579 --> 00:30:28,540
They're drawing up a proposal
introducing his member

300
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,180
into her historic chamber.

301
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:34,260
- You wished you'd said it.
- All right.

302
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:40,060
l wish Stiles was here. We got a bill
Steubens' committee's been blocking.

303
00:30:40,259 --> 00:30:45,260
l'd love to see the senator march over
and lobby him with Blondie sitting there.

304
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:49,500
Why don't you do it? You're the real
brains in Stiles's office.

305
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,820
We know it, but Steubens doesn't yet.

306
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:56,340
- Take a vacation!
- Drink your drink!

307
00:30:56,539 --> 00:30:58,460
Get him out of here.

308
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,820
Taxi !

309
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:11,300
We're going to Ronnie and Nancy's.
Want to come?

310
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,260
- Bye.
- Goodnight.

311
00:31:17,539 --> 00:31:23,420
Kentucm plates. Russell Building
parking sticker. Steubens' car.

312
00:31:23,619 --> 00:31:27,660
Wow! Now l've seen it all.
Can we go now?

313
00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:46,260
- Get the jack out of the trunk.
- What for?

314
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:53,620
Peter, what the fuck are you doing?

315
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,340
Oh, no!

316
00:32:22,099 --> 00:32:24,620
Yeah, they got me, too.

317
00:32:32,099 --> 00:32:34,420
Senator Steubens?

318
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,380
Tim, it's Senator Steubens.

319
00:32:40,579 --> 00:32:44,580
Senator, l'm a great,
great admirer of yours.

320
00:32:44,779 --> 00:32:48,820
Oh, vey nice to meet you, sir.
Miss Winston.

321
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:51,100
- Peter.
- Hi.

322
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:54,220
Must be a Democratic precinct.

323
00:32:59,059 --> 00:33:01,300
Let me change your tyre.

324
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:04,660
Oh, no, l couldn't ask you to do that.

325
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:07,660
- Just take my car.
- l couldn't.

326
00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:10,540
l'm an aide to Senator Stiles.

327
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,340
Stiles?

328
00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:15,700
Good people, Stiles. Good people.

329
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:20,100
l could just run up to your office
tomorrow, exchange keys.

330
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:23,100
lt would be an honour, Senator.

331
00:33:23,299 --> 00:33:25,860
- l don't know...
- Let's accept.

332
00:33:26,059 --> 00:33:28,260
You think so, honey?

333
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,220
OK. Thank you.

334
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:35,500
Just let me have a word with our
good friend here. Hold that, honey.

335
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,500
- Nice meeting you.
- You, too.

336
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:43,700
- Peter Burton, Senator.
- Just call me Frank, Pete.

337
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:50,060
- l know what this looks like.
- Like a senator working late.

338
00:33:50,259 --> 00:33:53,900
l know what it looks like.
Don't yank my chain.

339
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:57,340
- No, Frank.
- Just between us men.

340
00:33:57,539 --> 00:34:01,860
- Can't stress the importance.
- No need, Frank.

341
00:34:02,059 --> 00:34:03,980
Thank you.

342
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,100
Pete.

343
00:34:06,299 --> 00:34:09,300
Thank you again. Come on, honey.

344
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,620
Senator.

345
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,460
- Thank you.
- Goodnight.

346
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,820
Frank, hury.

347
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:40,140
- The moves on this kid!
- You stuck his tyre. That's a crime.

348
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:43,100
OK, so l created a situation.

349
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:47,260
So what? l did him a favour,
equals Stiles did him a favour.

350
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:51,220
So he's on our dance card in
a close vote. What's wrong?

351
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:52,820
lt's wrong.

352
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:04,500
You think the Department of Justice
never cuts corners? It's a new day.

353
00:35:04,699 --> 00:35:08,980
- What the fuck does that mean?
- Don't get caught.

354
00:35:15,219 --> 00:35:19,140
Lighten up.
l didn't break into Watergate.

355
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:23,700
l let the air out of a tyre. It's kids' stuff.

356
00:35:32,179 --> 00:35:34,980
Baker's moving to excuse Standish,

357
00:35:35,179 --> 00:35:39,020
so we've got to get into his involvement
with the pipeline contracts.

358
00:35:39,219 --> 00:35:41,620
Hammer Standish
when he twists his watch.

359
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,060
What?

360
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:46,940
Evey time he takes the Fifth
or ''can't recall'', he twists it.

361
00:35:47,139 --> 00:35:52,500
Like those Lebanese lobbying answers.
He twists his watch, come down hard.

362
00:35:52,699 --> 00:35:54,580
Hey, Pete.

363
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:59,300
- Your boss is writing ''kick me'' on this.
- Afternoon, Frank.

364
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,260
- You know Peter?
- Met last night.

365
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:07,620
We had a nice chat about your
amendment to the Appropriations Bill.

366
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:12,700
Listen, Jim. Walk back with me
after the hearing. l think we can talk.

367
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,100
See you inside.

368
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,900
Yeah.

369
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:30,020
- Will you tell me what that was about?
- No time. We'd better get inside.

370
00:36:42,699 --> 00:36:47,020
l told Mrs Santana we'd be out
of the apartment Monday morning.

371
00:36:47,219 --> 00:36:51,020
- Did she rent it?
- l don't know. Why?

372
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:56,180
l'm staying, Tim.
l'm not going back to school.

373
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:01,140
- You're kidding?
- No. We're in the best school there is.

374
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:04,060
College of Ways and Means, DC.

375
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,020
- Let's go.
- Let's do it.

376
00:37:10,059 --> 00:37:12,180
- Take 'em.
- Good shot!

377
00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:22,460
- Are you sure it's OK?
- Yes, l was nodding off, too.

378
00:37:22,659 --> 00:37:24,660
Dinner's not for an hour,
so we can walk...

379
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,860
Or iust get a bite. No, l'm not hungy!

380
00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:30,860
- l'm getting fat anyway.
- You are not!

381
00:37:31,059 --> 00:37:34,540
- Maybe if we walked l'd be hungy.
- It's OK.

382
00:37:34,739 --> 00:37:39,300
l'm sory. You put this big night
together and l'm being a creep.

383
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,860
- What's the matter?
- We're about to be separated again.

384
00:37:43,059 --> 00:37:46,620
And l'm thinking maybe
that's not such a bad thing.

385
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:50,340
- What?
- l don't know where it's going.

386
00:37:50,539 --> 00:37:53,140
lt's going fine. What is this?

387
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:58,100
Just because you say it's fine,
doesn't make it fine.

388
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,900
OK.

389
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:03,460
OK.

390
00:38:05,019 --> 00:38:06,780
l'm listening.

391
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,860
Well...

392
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:17,940
Why are you so set on Justice?
Isn't there another track?

393
00:38:18,139 --> 00:38:23,060
- Why be out of the loop?
- Ass-kiss your way to the middle?

394
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:27,100
That's not what it is.
My parents have a wonderful life in it.

395
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:31,580
- You're one of the best.
- You think the DOJ is for rejects?

396
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,980
No, l'm not saying that.

397
00:38:34,179 --> 00:38:37,300
l don't want to spend my life
tying to get votes.

398
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:44,340
lf you're happy with your programme,
fine. But it's not mine, or ours.

399
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:48,620
l can't say l'd be happy
being basically a cop's wife.

400
00:38:50,059 --> 00:38:53,100
Not a cop, an attorney.

401
00:38:56,219 --> 00:38:58,900
No one said anything about marriage.

402
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:07,740
l hate the way l sound,
but l have to say these things.

403
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:11,220
We have to think about them.

404
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:15,060
So, l'll call you when l'm in town next.

405
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:19,100
l didn't mean to hurt you. l love you.

406
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,380
Let's get out of here.

407
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,820
l'm going to the bathroom.
Wait for me, OK?

408
00:39:29,019 --> 00:39:30,740
Yeah.

409
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:53,020
- l knew it was no before l could ask.
- Did she give you a reason?

410
00:39:53,219 --> 00:39:58,940
My career plans aren't glamorous
enough. It seems like that matters.

411
00:39:59,139 --> 00:40:03,500
- What will you do?
- Ty and fall out of love with her.

412
00:40:03,699 --> 00:40:06,180
She loves you. It's obvious.

413
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:12,140
lf she loses you over some agenda,
then she doesn't deserve you.

414
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:15,540
- Am l right?
- Peter.

415
00:40:15,739 --> 00:40:19,140
- Could l speak with you?
- Certainly, John.

416
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:20,900
- Hi, Tim.
- Hi.

417
00:40:21,099 --> 00:40:24,860
- What's up?
- l just came from Steubens' office.

418
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:31,700
- Is he behaving himself?
- Maybe you want to talk in private.

419
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:37,580
Tim's my brother.
He's going to hear it anyway.

420
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:40,020
Here it is.

421
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:48,180
Don't you ever, ever go tying to make
some deal for the senator's office.

422
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:52,180
You want to play maverick,
take it somewhere else.

423
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:55,900
lf you're staying,
you go through channels.

424
00:40:56,099 --> 00:40:58,500
Got me?

425
00:40:58,699 --> 00:41:01,180
- Got you.
- Good.

426
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:05,980
The campaign staff in Connecticut
is spread too thin. We need a hand.

427
00:41:06,179 --> 00:41:09,180
Take the shuttle to New York,
then the train to New Haven.

428
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:13,820
- Someone will pick you up.
- Decoration committee?

429
00:41:14,019 --> 00:41:18,140
- Fundamentals. Something you missed.
- Ask you one thing?

430
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:22,140
- Quickly.
- Is Steubens with the amendment?

431
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:25,020
- That's not the point.
- l know.

432
00:41:25,219 --> 00:41:27,220
l don't think you do.

433
00:41:30,059 --> 00:41:31,500
Yes.

434
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:44,300
He's fucking with me. It's personal.

435
00:41:49,179 --> 00:41:52,940
Now l have to find a way round him.
Shouldn't be too hard.

436
00:41:53,139 --> 00:41:55,620
40 years old and he's still an aide.

437
00:41:55,820 --> 00:42:00,180
Dresses like a leftover campus radical.
John Denver-looking motherf...

438
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:04,020
Thank you. Thank you vey much.

439
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:09,020
Lyndon Johnson once told me
that a good speech

440
00:42:09,219 --> 00:42:13,420
is measured by how quickly
it gets the audience on its feet.

441
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:18,180
So, the owner of the black Mercedes
with Connecticut plates,

442
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:21,300
your lights are on.

443
00:42:25,179 --> 00:42:27,780
Sory about that.

444
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,580
Not staying for the rest of the speech?

445
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:40,300
No. l just wanted to see
how my joke went over.

446
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,500
Been here since eight in the morning.
Goodnight.

447
00:42:43,739 --> 00:42:46,740
Where are you going?

448
00:42:49,019 --> 00:42:54,900
l'm going to sneak over that fence,
take off my clothes and float in that pool.

449
00:42:55,099 --> 00:42:58,020
l'd ask you, but l hate hearing no.

450
00:42:58,219 --> 00:43:01,380
How do you know l'd say no?

451
00:43:06,659 --> 00:43:10,100
'Cause l don't think those looks
you've been dealing me

452
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:13,580
add up to you actually doing anything.

453
00:43:15,099 --> 00:43:21,740
l think you're a daddy's girl. And
she doesn't fool around with the help.

454
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:25,940
- Got me all figured out, huh?
- Tell me l'm wrong.

455
00:43:27,539 --> 00:43:29,660
You're wrong.

456
00:43:39,179 --> 00:43:42,180
- What about Tim?
- What about Tim?

457
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:46,500
- What are we going to tell him?
- Nothing.

458
00:43:46,699 --> 00:43:49,140
We were both curious.

459
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:54,900
You've been in my bed evey night
this week. That's more than curious.

460
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:59,020
This doesn't have anything
to do with Tim.

461
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:02,820
You going back with him?

462
00:44:03,019 --> 00:44:05,580
Peter, l love Tim.

463
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:10,020
Whether or not l can be with him,
l don't know.

464
00:44:10,219 --> 00:44:13,140
Whatever happens, you're not part of it.

465
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:17,300
You don't want to be.
You're his best friend.

466
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,820
What if you're what l want?

467
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:28,020
- What if l fall in love with you?
- God, no. No, no, no.

468
00:44:28,219 --> 00:44:33,300
- This is screwed up enough as it is.
- l could.

469
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,540
You could fall in love with me, too.

470
00:44:36,739 --> 00:44:40,500
- Stop it. l don't think so.
- Why? l'm not good enough?

471
00:44:40,699 --> 00:44:45,380
- Come on, Peter.
- Just say that you could love me.

472
00:44:45,579 --> 00:44:48,740
- No.
- Just say it.

473
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:51,060
Just say it.

474
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:57,140
No!

475
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:05,700
They pay peanuts with 2 weeks a year?

476
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:09,860
- l just started. It gets better.
- l know waiters with better deals.

477
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:18,660
- Who'd you say your friend was?
- John Palmeri.

478
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:22,740
A developer. Took a big initiative
for Stiles last election.

479
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:24,580
A big initiative?

480
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:29,580
- A lot of cash and kicked labour butt.
- Did you let him borrow your car?

481
00:45:31,059 --> 00:45:32,900
That's vey funny.

482
00:45:33,099 --> 00:45:38,180
He needed the senator's ear,
l was able to help and here we are.

483
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:44,140
l'm not an intern any more. l got
my own relationship with the senator.

484
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:47,020
Chief Administrative Aide. Thank you.

485
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:52,380
- You're right on schedule, aren't you?
- First vacation in two years.

486
00:45:52,579 --> 00:45:56,060
- l'll beat you skiing, too.
- l don't ski on the bunny slopes.

487
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:59,540
- Think l need a lesson?
- Three or four.

488
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,460
You don't have to decide now.

489
00:46:04,659 --> 00:46:07,420
- If you get tired slogging...
- Slogging?

490
00:46:07,619 --> 00:46:11,460
Turtling... l got you a slot with Stiles.
Me and you together.

491
00:46:11,659 --> 00:46:14,380
- Me under you?
- No, l show you the ropes.

492
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:17,940
ln a week, you'll be writing laws,
not looking them up.

493
00:46:18,139 --> 00:46:20,220
- Enforcing them.
- Ty it.

494
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:24,220
- Why do you want me there?
- For the future.

495
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:27,660
For when l make the run.
l don't kid myself.

496
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:32,660
l'm Mr Shine. Give me a baby to kiss
and a filmmaker to shoot it, l'll be in.

497
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:36,180
- l'll need my legal eagle.
- l like what l do.

498
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:40,700
Somebody hurts someone,
steals from them, l can right it.

499
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:44,420
- That's vey liberating.
- Why are you so naive?

500
00:46:44,619 --> 00:46:48,740
- Your Washington is not mine.
- You're wrong, man.

501
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:51,980
lt's all the same ball game.
Even at Justice.

502
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:55,460
You need to realise that.

503
00:46:55,659 --> 00:46:59,620
lf you're that good,
you'll have plenty of men to pick from.

504
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:05,460
lf l can ever help from where l am,
all you've got to do is ask. All right?

505
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:17,460
- Last run.
- Damn, did we do this week up!

506
00:47:17,659 --> 00:47:19,660
Yeah, we did.

507
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:26,700
God, look at that.

508
00:47:28,219 --> 00:47:31,540
Listen, Tim, l've got to talk to you
about something.

509
00:47:31,739 --> 00:47:36,540
About seeing somebody.
l haven't been straight.

510
00:47:36,739 --> 00:47:38,300
l haven't...

511
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:45,580
Diana. l've been with Diana.

512
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:53,460
After you went back to school, l was
around her, around the campaign.

513
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:59,060
- It's been on and off for a year.
- And now?

514
00:48:01,139 --> 00:48:06,860
- l'm going to ask her to mary me.
- That's your relationship with Stiles?

515
00:48:07,059 --> 00:48:10,140
- Don't think that.
- What am l supposed to think?

516
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:13,060
lt iust happened.

517
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:30,860
l'm taking this. If you want an easier
run, l'll meet you at the bottom.

518
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:38,820
- Last run. We've got to ski it together.
- It's up to you. Follow if you want.

519
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:04,660
Shit!

520
00:50:44,099 --> 00:50:48,420
Pete, stop! No! Stop! Just fall over!

521
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:59,300
Ski patrol! Ski patrol!

522
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:13,420
- Don't move.
- My fucking leg!

523
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:16,180
Ski patrol's on its way.

524
00:51:18,619 --> 00:51:21,820
l didn't hear you soon enough.
l know you were yelling.

525
00:51:22,019 --> 00:51:25,700
- l'm sory.
- l couldn't hear. l know you were there.

526
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:29,660
l know you meant to warn me.

527
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:34,220
- l know you were tying to help.
- l'm sory.

528
00:51:36,179 --> 00:51:38,460
Ski patrol!

529
00:51:38,659 --> 00:51:44,460
You know with Diana l never meant
to hurt you. You know that?

530
00:51:44,659 --> 00:51:47,340
- Right?
- Yes.

531
00:51:47,539 --> 00:51:50,100
Ski patrol!

532
00:51:56,579 --> 00:51:57,980
Oh, fuck!

533
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:00,460
Don't move.

534
00:52:01,539 --> 00:52:03,820
Be my best man.

535
00:52:06,139 --> 00:52:09,300
- Good?
- Yes.

536
00:52:10,619 --> 00:52:13,940
So l was absolved
of tryíng to kíII my best fríend.

537
00:52:14,139 --> 00:52:16,100
And he was acquítted

538
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:19,460
of snakíng the only gírl
that really mattered to me.

539
00:52:19,659 --> 00:52:24,860
Even fro_en and ín shock,
one leg mangled and mo ríbs cracked,

540
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:28,820
Peter Burton
could cut hímself a deal.

541
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:33,220
Louise, that's crazy.

542
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:38,980
We could hold fundraisers forever.
It wouldn't make up for that kind of cut.

543
00:52:39,179 --> 00:52:43,100
Don't do this! You pull out on this vote
and l'm screwed!

544
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:47,980
- Hold on. Diana.
- One minute. Could you hold on?

545
00:52:48,179 --> 00:52:52,980
- Warrilow's told Peckheiser to vote no.
- Dick's cutting Meals for Millions.

546
00:52:53,179 --> 00:52:54,980
- Do l care?
- David!

547
00:52:55,219 --> 00:52:57,820
Louise, hi, Peter. And to you.

548
00:52:58,019 --> 00:53:00,780
Don't tell me he feels terrible.

549
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:04,820
He's going to look terrible
if Diana's forced to fight him.

550
00:53:05,019 --> 00:53:06,780
- OK. Louise.
- David.

551
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:10,620
Yes, isn't he? l'm back in a week.
Hold him until then.

552
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:14,220
l'll get my father involved
and we'll figure it out.

553
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:19,500
You're a saint. Great.
Love to the kids. Bye. Yes!

554
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:24,340
And this must be Palmeri Bay.

555
00:53:24,539 --> 00:53:28,100
Officially it's still Long Island Sound,
but we're working on it!

556
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:31,300
- What do you think?
- It's beautiful.

557
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:35,220
l'm glad you like it. It's yours.

558
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:39,300
- That was easy. Let's look at Porsches.
- l'm serious.

559
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:43,460
l know you're going to love it here.
Especially you, Diana.

560
00:53:43,659 --> 00:53:46,860
- Thank you, but...
- But nothing.

561
00:53:47,059 --> 00:53:51,060
l'm looking forward at a man
who's going to be my Congressman.

562
00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:54,220
He needs to establish
residency in this district.

563
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:58,540
- l couldn't afford this place.
- Your campaign fund can.

564
00:53:59,539 --> 00:54:03,540
- What campaign fund?
- The exploratoy money l'm raising.

565
00:54:03,739 --> 00:54:08,020
A portion will be allocated for housing
and office space. This is it.

566
00:54:09,739 --> 00:54:14,180
- Too good to be true?
- There's nothing unethical about it.

567
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:17,940
lf that's what you're worried about.
This is done a lot.

568
00:54:18,139 --> 00:54:22,340
- l didn't know that.
- You live, you learn.

569
00:54:23,579 --> 00:54:28,100
- Diana, l want to show you the rest.
- Sure.

570
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:32,060
This is the master bedroom.
Most rooms face the water...

571
00:54:33,739 --> 00:54:37,820
lf you're not comfortable with it,
just hand those keys back.

572
00:54:39,099 --> 00:54:42,900
The important thing is
l want to help you, work with you.

573
00:54:43,099 --> 00:54:48,380
- Any time you're uncomfortable, say no.
- Any time, on anything?

574
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:50,940
Absolutely.

575
00:55:02,619 --> 00:55:08,660
We're bidding for a federally-funded
Iow-income project for Bridgeport.

576
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:13,380
lt's a fair bid and we want the job,
but we've got competition.

577
00:55:13,579 --> 00:55:17,100
- You said you've a friend at Justice.
- A good buddy.

578
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:20,660
- l don't trust him.
- That's prejudice.

579
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:22,260
No, instinct.

580
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:25,780
- If his name was Winthrop...
- That's prejudice!

581
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:29,940
- He's a respected businessman.
- He's a silk suit with tax scams.

582
00:55:30,139 --> 00:55:34,100
You don't trust him because
he fought to get where he is.

583
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:39,860
- He sees something in me.
- So do l, Peter. l married you.

584
00:55:40,059 --> 00:55:45,860
Quit tying to tear me down. l'm just
tying to get us where we want to be.

585
00:55:46,059 --> 00:55:48,460
- Unbelievable.
- Congratulations.

586
00:55:48,659 --> 00:55:51,700
- Take care. Bye.
- See you later.

587
00:55:53,179 --> 00:55:57,460
- Are others as guilty as Wagstaff?
- Did you think they'd convict?

588
00:55:57,659 --> 00:56:01,020
Are you satisfied
Wagstaff's as high as it went?

589
00:56:01,219 --> 00:56:05,620
l can't answer questions because
of the appeal. l have a statement.

590
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:09,700
Wagstaff's conviction is not only proof
that the system works,

591
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:12,660
but that it can work across the board.

592
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:16,020
No matter how high up,
you're still accountable.

593
00:56:16,219 --> 00:56:20,820
l thank the juy, local prosecutors
and eveyone who came forward.

594
00:56:21,019 --> 00:56:24,780
l've a message to the Orlando Sentínel._
Garrity, two Rs and a Y.

595
00:56:30,179 --> 00:56:35,380
- What are you doing here?
- Taking Dick Tracy to the Super Bowl.

596
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:42,020
- 623. We're here on the left.
- This is great!

597
00:56:42,219 --> 00:56:46,340
- He promised me the 50-yard line.
- Where'd you get the tickets?

598
00:56:46,539 --> 00:56:49,780
Business Round Table.
The NRA's got a sm-box.

599
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:53,060
Maybe we can hang around there
the second half.

600
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:57,220
Why are you wasting the Super Bowl
on a lowly DOJ attorney?

601
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:01,260
Maybe l did waste them.
Fuck you. l never see you now.

602
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:05,580
l'm sory. It's this weekend.
Eveybody's brown-nosing.

603
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:09,260
l feel like the third wheel
on your date with destiny.

604
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:11,700
Ríse for our Natíonal Anthem.

605
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:17,340
- If a guy promises the 50-yard line...
- All right. It's the Banner.

606
00:57:17,539 --> 00:57:20,900
What so proudly we haíled...

607
00:57:21,619 --> 00:57:26,180
You've been buying drinks
all weekend for the State of Florida.

608
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:29,940
Log-rolling. Yeah, l know.
Meet Senator Lackerby.

609
00:57:30,139 --> 00:57:32,380
l don't know.

610
00:57:32,579 --> 00:57:35,500
Just take a bow. Not for me, for you.

611
00:57:35,699 --> 00:57:39,980
- You don't understand.
- l understand plenty. Come with me.

612
00:57:40,179 --> 00:57:43,380
Excuse me. Coming through. Senator.

613
00:57:43,579 --> 00:57:49,220
- Peter Burton. Senator Stiles' office.
- Of course. Welcome to Florida.

614
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:52,340
Thank you. Meet a friend of mine.

615
00:57:52,539 --> 00:57:56,500
Meet the man
who put Sandy Wagstaff behind bars,

616
00:57:56,699 --> 00:58:00,980
Deputy US Attorney, Tim Garrity.
Tim Garrity, Senator Lackerby.

617
00:58:01,179 --> 00:58:05,860
Sandy Wagstaff stands
for progress in this state.

618
00:58:06,059 --> 00:58:10,420
l don't care what peccadilloes
your witch-hunt has scared up,

619
00:58:10,619 --> 00:58:14,340
it is not justice when
a Sandy Wagstaff goes to prison.

620
00:58:14,539 --> 00:58:20,100
The Department of Justice, the FBl,
Dade County prosecutors, a juy

621
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:23,820
and some of your own staff
would disagree with you.

622
00:58:24,019 --> 00:58:29,020
lf you have a problem, take it up
with them. l'm only here for the beer.

623
00:58:29,219 --> 00:58:30,900
Excuse me.

624
00:58:31,099 --> 00:58:32,980
Did you have to?

625
00:58:33,179 --> 00:58:35,300
- Should l apologise?
- He's a senator.

626
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:39,660
He's a crook. We could've
indicted him and got orders not to.

627
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:43,220
You're right and
we go back to the lousy seats.

628
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:45,900
- l'm kidding.
- It's hard to tell sometimes.

629
00:58:46,099 --> 00:58:48,460
Will you look into something for me?

630
00:58:48,659 --> 00:58:51,500
New Hampton Development.

631
00:58:51,699 --> 00:58:55,540
lt's similar to Wagstaff,
bribes from federally-funded projects.

632
00:58:55,739 --> 00:58:58,820
lt's on authority.
l told a constituent l'd speak to you.

633
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:21,620
- What did she say?
- Her father's tests came back.

634
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:25,620
- An early stage of Alzheimer's.
- Oh, my God!

635
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:30,140
Jesus, l'm sory.

636
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:32,300
Yeah. Me, too.

637
00:59:35,139 --> 00:59:38,140
- l never told you, OK?
- Yeah, yeah.

638
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:42,580
- He won't even tell his staff.
- How's Diana taking it?

639
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:45,140
You know, bad.

640
00:59:46,699 --> 00:59:49,780
l mean,
the girl never left home anyway.

641
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:55,780
- Now it'll get worse.
- Don't look at it like that.

642
00:59:55,980 --> 01:00:02,180
Since we married, l've been living
by this yardstick, James B Stiles.

643
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:06,660
- She married me.
- He's been nothing but good to you.

644
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:10,860
As long as l was a kid
hustling floor votes or money for him.

645
01:00:11,059 --> 01:00:14,220
lt's different since l married
his daughter. It is.

646
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:17,900
lt's nothing overt, but l feel it.
l'm not one of them.

647
01:00:18,099 --> 01:00:21,460
You're crazy.
They don't think like that.

648
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:24,180
But, Tim, it's true.

649
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:26,700
lt is.

650
01:00:34,739 --> 01:00:36,700
A knock. That's better.

651
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:41,940
Clean draft on the Armed Services
report. You're welcome.

652
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:44,980
Wait a minute. Shut the door.

653
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:55,980
l'm going to be leaving in a couple
of weeks. Taking some time off.

654
01:00:56,179 --> 01:01:00,340
l'm looking into running
for a seat in the fourth CD.

655
01:01:01,059 --> 01:01:04,020
- Tinker isn't vacating.
- l'm anticipating it.

656
01:01:04,219 --> 01:01:07,540
- Is Stiles backing you?
- l'm just exploring things.

657
01:01:07,739 --> 01:01:12,820
The point is, the senator's going
to want me to realign the office staff,

658
01:01:13,019 --> 01:01:17,620
and l'm going to recommend
against you taking over.

659
01:01:17,820 --> 01:01:21,180
- l'm shocked.
- You think it's personal, but it isn't.

660
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:24,740
l think you're vey good as an expediter.

661
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:27,100
Vey valuable.

662
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:32,140
l'm not confident you'll focus on the real
business of this office. l'm sory.

663
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:36,020
Don't be sory, John. l'll be OK.

664
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:39,220
Thanks for the tip.

665
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:42,220
Oh, yes!

666
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:47,900
- You hit the shit out of that ball.
- You'd better stick to politics.

667
01:01:49,019 --> 01:01:53,740
OK. Tinker's vacating a seat
in the fourth district.

668
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:55,940
- l want to run.
- Seriously?

669
01:01:56,139 --> 01:02:01,260
- l'd like to run with your support.
- Did you talk to Lawy?

670
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:05,460
- He's a manager, not a leader.
- He's got a terrific legislative mind.

671
01:02:05,659 --> 01:02:10,660
- He deserves a chance to prove himself.
- Nobody'll vote for him.

672
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:12,700
l can do the iob.

673
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:16,900
l need you on staff,
especially with John leaving.

674
01:02:17,099 --> 01:02:21,380
- l'd be more use to you in the House.
- Leave that to me.

675
01:02:21,579 --> 01:02:26,100
- Next term, we'll set you an agenda.
- l've got an agenda, sir.

676
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:29,420
l want to run in the next election.

677
01:02:29,619 --> 01:02:32,620
A couple of terms
with you as my mentor,

678
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:36,260
and l hope to fill your seat
when you retire.

679
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:40,900
- Who said anything about retiring?
- Well...

680
01:02:42,099 --> 01:02:44,540
l assumed with your illness...

681
01:02:44,739 --> 01:02:49,780
Well, don't assume. They've assured me
the progression can take years.

682
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:54,660
That's great news!
Then, let's look at it long range.

683
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:59,420
An across-the-board ally
in the House for your final term.

684
01:02:59,619 --> 01:03:03,380
And, more importantly,
someone to cary on your work.

685
01:03:04,219 --> 01:03:07,300
l want to be that man, Senator.

686
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:10,300
What if l say no, Peter?

687
01:03:15,219 --> 01:03:18,860
Then l have to seek support elsewhere.

688
01:03:19,059 --> 01:03:21,820
Wouldn't that look strange?

689
01:03:22,019 --> 01:03:26,820
Bringing his ammo into another camp.
People hear Alzheimer's, they wory.

690
01:03:27,019 --> 01:03:32,340
- l don't want to think about that choice.
- Don't fuck with me!

691
01:03:32,539 --> 01:03:35,700
l've been playing hardball
since before you were born.

692
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:41,300
l don't mind playing hardball.
l do mind being taken for a fool.

693
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:46,780
- Does Diana know?
- She's knows l'm seeking your support.

694
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:49,180
Which is all l'm doing.

695
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:52,020
What's your hury, Peter?

696
01:03:52,219 --> 01:03:57,940
- Got a new cure for this county's ills?
- No, not like that.

697
01:03:58,139 --> 01:04:01,380
Only issue l saw you catch fire over
was where to eat

698
01:04:01,579 --> 01:04:05,660
with those Gucci-assed lobbyists
you're so fond of.

699
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:10,100
So, what is it, boy? The money sucks.

700
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:14,460
Food tastes the same.
You still get a year older evey birthday.

701
01:04:14,659 --> 01:04:16,980
The future, Senator.

702
01:04:17,179 --> 01:04:20,980
l want to contribute.
l feel my time is now.

703
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:24,500
You do, huh?

704
01:04:26,539 --> 01:04:29,420
l'm not going to stand in your way.

705
01:04:29,619 --> 01:04:34,820
My last term's too important to me
to take any chances with the election.

706
01:04:35,019 --> 01:04:37,860
But let me tell you something.

707
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:45,300
You may win an election or two.
You may be able to live with yourself.

708
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:51,260
But God help you when the people
find out. They always do.

709
01:05:07,836 --> 01:05:11,757
The time is now, John.
Tinker's not running for re-election.

710
01:05:11,956 --> 01:05:13,877
The seat's open.

711
01:05:15,476 --> 01:05:19,277
- Stiles'll back you?
- Yes.

712
01:05:19,476 --> 01:05:24,437
You'll need funding.
Organisation. More funding.

713
01:05:26,036 --> 01:05:30,437
- It's a lot of orchestrating.
- What could l do to expedite things?

714
01:05:32,036 --> 01:05:37,157
Give a couple of tugs. Deadline for
the Bridgeport project's coming up.

715
01:05:37,356 --> 01:05:43,877
lf we got that contract 'cause of you,
my friends would be vey impressed.

716
01:05:44,077 --> 01:05:49,077
My friend at Justice has been looking
into it, but he's coming up empty.

717
01:05:49,277 --> 01:05:53,197
He's sharp. He's not missing anything.
There's nothing there.

718
01:05:55,036 --> 01:05:56,317
Yeah.

719
01:05:57,356 --> 01:05:59,077
That's possible.

720
01:06:03,356 --> 01:06:07,677
You knew there was nothing
when you had me tip him.

721
01:06:08,637 --> 01:06:12,757
You're letting your line slack.
Look out. Give me that.

722
01:06:14,717 --> 01:06:17,557
l wanted you in a position to help us.

723
01:06:17,757 --> 01:06:19,117
How?

724
01:06:19,317 --> 01:06:22,277
There's a Justice Department
investigation.

725
01:06:22,476 --> 01:06:26,117
Reveal that, New Hampton's
out of the running. It's a big favour.

726
01:06:26,317 --> 01:06:30,357
- He's a friend. l can't set him up.
- He'd never know.

727
01:06:30,556 --> 01:06:34,837
What could happen? A little hot water.
Isn't that worth it?

728
01:06:35,036 --> 01:06:37,397
l can't do it.

729
01:06:41,717 --> 01:06:44,317
- Come on.
- l got it.

730
01:06:45,597 --> 01:06:48,437
Say l'm the Ghost of Christmas Future.

731
01:06:48,637 --> 01:06:54,037
There you are. Diana, kids, nice fire.
You're counting blessings.

732
01:06:54,237 --> 01:06:57,517
What's making you runny inside?
Your achievements?

733
01:06:57,717 --> 01:07:00,597
A card from what's-his-name?

734
01:07:00,797 --> 01:07:06,517
''Warmest holiday wishes. We must
get together. It's been too long.''

735
01:07:06,717 --> 01:07:11,157
l think l know the answer.
l just hope you do the right thing.

736
01:07:29,597 --> 01:07:32,797
Thís ís Sam Mínot, New _aven
Sentine_. Is thís Mr Garríty?

737
01:07:32,996 --> 01:07:34,557
Yeah.

738
01:07:34,757 --> 01:07:40,157
l'm doing a stoy on your investigation
of the New Hampton Development.

739
01:07:40,356 --> 01:07:46,517
- This is iust a threshold investigation.
- lt's an ínvestígatíon, ísn't ít?

740
01:07:46,717 --> 01:07:50,157
Well, yes, but...
Who are your sources?

741
01:07:50,356 --> 01:07:55,077
- What's so funny?
- Oh, it's just a little ray of sunshine.

742
01:08:00,317 --> 01:08:04,677
- What were you thinking of?
- He called my direct line.

743
01:08:04,876 --> 01:08:07,677
l assumed he'd been cleared.

744
01:08:07,876 --> 01:08:11,757
You're a US attorney!
You don't assume anything!

745
01:08:11,956 --> 01:08:15,317
- No, sir.
- You were ambushed. Any idea why?

746
01:08:15,516 --> 01:08:19,117
No. My tip-off was
from an aide to Senator Stiles.

747
01:08:19,317 --> 01:08:22,037
He's coming up empty, too.

748
01:08:22,237 --> 01:08:26,357
- What's his name?
- Peter Burton. He's my best friend.

749
01:08:26,556 --> 01:08:30,837
Someone's got an agenda here,
and we're going to find out who.

750
01:08:31,037 --> 01:08:33,117
l'll have to offer you up.

751
01:08:33,317 --> 01:08:37,557
l'm sory, but you're suspended
until further notice.

752
01:08:37,756 --> 01:08:39,637
Yes, sir.

753
01:08:43,837 --> 01:08:45,357
Thank you.

754
01:08:47,356 --> 01:08:50,797
- Hello, handsome.
- Hello, beautiful.

755
01:08:51,997 --> 01:08:56,037
- Am l the first one here?
- You're the only one coming.

756
01:08:56,237 --> 01:08:59,477
- What the...?
- Peter wanted us duded up.

757
01:08:59,676 --> 01:09:03,077
- Thought you wouldn't do it.
- He's right. Where is he?

758
01:09:03,277 --> 01:09:05,797
On the phone. A drink?

759
01:09:05,997 --> 01:09:08,477
- Scotch.
- No ice.

760
01:09:08,676 --> 01:09:10,437
No ice.

761
01:09:13,117 --> 01:09:15,317
The family crest.

762
01:09:16,077 --> 01:09:19,397
- Are you all right?
- No.

763
01:09:19,596 --> 01:09:24,117
- All my laundy's clean, though.
- They must know it's not your fault.

764
01:09:24,317 --> 01:09:27,637
How long are they
keeping you suspended?

765
01:09:27,837 --> 01:09:31,157
Until they can pin it
on somebody else.

766
01:09:34,356 --> 01:09:39,277
- You look good.
- You look good, too.

767
01:09:40,396 --> 01:09:42,277
What's the latest?

768
01:09:42,476 --> 01:09:45,357
l was set up by New Hampton's rival.

769
01:09:45,556 --> 01:09:48,197
- Like another developer?
- Yes.

770
01:09:50,636 --> 01:09:52,597
What do you think?

771
01:09:52,796 --> 01:09:57,757
l frisked Palmeri, if that's what you're
thinking. Diana's got a thing about him.

772
01:09:57,957 --> 01:10:02,557
You think l'm sitting on my hands?
Of course l checked John.

773
01:10:03,636 --> 01:10:08,197
- He had nothing to do with it.
- Justice will get to the bottom of it.

774
01:10:08,396 --> 01:10:11,557
They may doze, but they never close.

775
01:10:13,396 --> 01:10:16,677
Excuse me,
l've got to check on the lamb.

776
01:10:19,997 --> 01:10:22,797
We like it pink!

777
01:10:22,997 --> 01:10:27,437
You can always hang
around here for free grub. Say yes.

778
01:10:27,636 --> 01:10:28,957
Don't start.

779
01:10:29,157 --> 01:10:32,597
The fact is you're out of work.

780
01:10:32,796 --> 01:10:37,197
At least let me offer to help.
l'm announcing Monday.

781
01:10:38,716 --> 01:10:42,357
Come down.
Let me give you the lay of the land.

782
01:10:42,556 --> 01:10:47,037
Meet some people.
Tim, give me that much.

783
01:10:47,237 --> 01:10:50,197
l'll come watch your announcement.
That's it.

784
01:10:51,917 --> 01:10:54,477
We don't have to feed him now.

785
01:10:56,356 --> 01:11:01,477
- What are we covering today?
- Burton, announcing for Congress.

786
01:11:01,676 --> 01:11:04,597
Hope there's something to eat in there.

787
01:11:15,997 --> 01:11:18,957
The senator's cutting it close.

788
01:11:21,636 --> 01:11:24,957
l still think you ought to open
with a fart joke.

789
01:11:25,556 --> 01:11:28,677
- The senator is here.
- Mr Garrity.

790
01:11:28,877 --> 01:11:31,957
Here, Mr Burton. The senator's speech.

791
01:11:32,157 --> 01:11:33,957
Senator.

792
01:11:43,356 --> 01:11:46,197
There's only one sentence about Peter.

793
01:11:46,396 --> 01:11:50,837
- l said l'd introduce him, that's all.
- What's going on?

794
01:11:51,037 --> 01:11:53,357
- A misunderstanding.
- My ass!

795
01:11:53,556 --> 01:11:58,997
- What good is this going to do?
- What is he talking about?

796
01:11:59,197 --> 01:12:02,597
He said if l didn't back him,
he'd leak my illness.

797
01:12:02,796 --> 01:12:04,997
Not like that!

798
01:12:11,157 --> 01:12:14,837
- Are you saying he's lying?
- Sit down!

799
01:12:15,037 --> 01:12:19,317
He's got his version, l've got mine.
Side with your husband for once.

800
01:12:19,516 --> 01:12:23,357
You wanted this, too.
Did you think it would just come to us?

801
01:12:23,556 --> 01:12:25,437
l hate you!

802
01:12:26,756 --> 01:12:29,317
Diana, get back in here!

803
01:12:31,877 --> 01:12:36,477
l'm going out to introduce you,
and then our deal is done.

804
01:12:38,237 --> 01:12:43,517
And if you ever do anything
to hurt my daughter, l'll destroy you.

805
01:12:48,277 --> 01:12:51,197
- Gentlemen...
- We'll be right out.

806
01:12:51,997 --> 01:12:56,157
Now what do l do?
They're expecting the beautiful wife!

807
01:12:56,356 --> 01:12:59,717
- Hold on.
- l need a joke. She's nervous...

808
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:02,037
Did you blackmail him?

809
01:13:02,237 --> 01:13:05,237
l never threatened to use it. It's me!

810
01:13:05,436 --> 01:13:08,037
lt's you. But it's not a tyre!

811
01:13:08,237 --> 01:13:12,357
- Don't start. l did nothing to you.
- We got to go.

812
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:49,117
You were right.

813
01:13:49,317 --> 01:13:53,397
Burton was the source of the leak
of the investigation.

814
01:13:53,596 --> 01:13:57,317
We think he set you up
as a favour to John Palmeri.

815
01:13:57,516 --> 01:14:02,037
His associates got a federal project
by taking New Hampton out.

816
01:14:02,237 --> 01:14:08,117
- Burton's had ties to him for years.
- He lives in one of Palmeri's houses.

817
01:14:08,317 --> 01:14:13,397
We believe his campaign is being
backed by Palmeri and his associates.

818
01:14:14,997 --> 01:14:18,117
- You're assuming nothing?
- It's all backed up.

819
01:14:18,317 --> 01:14:21,477
We've had an ongoing investigation
into Palmeri.

820
01:14:21,676 --> 01:14:26,317
He's tied into racketeering,
bribey and fraud in two states.

821
01:14:26,516 --> 01:14:28,437
- What now?
- Nothing.

822
01:14:28,636 --> 01:14:31,997
We've nothing solid enough
to go after Palmeri.

823
01:14:32,197 --> 01:14:37,557
As for your pal Burton, fucking you
over's not a federal offence.

824
01:14:38,596 --> 01:14:41,037
- Let me go after him.
- What?

825
01:14:41,237 --> 01:14:44,477
Let me work undercover
on Burton's campaign.

826
01:14:44,676 --> 01:14:47,397
l could gather evidence on Palmeri.

827
01:14:47,596 --> 01:14:51,477
lf Burton's breaking the law,
we take it to Public Integrity.

828
01:14:51,676 --> 01:14:54,917
You're not FBl, you're a trial lanyer.
You're not equipped.

829
01:14:55,117 --> 01:14:57,397
He trusts me.

830
01:14:57,596 --> 01:15:02,677
You have somebody's trust, you've all
the equipment you need to nail them.

831
01:15:05,396 --> 01:15:08,597
Let me make some calls.

832
01:15:15,356 --> 01:15:19,077
- How you doing, Pete?
- Better now. Thank you.

833
01:15:19,277 --> 01:15:22,997
- l haven't done anything.
- Thanks for still having faith.

834
01:15:23,197 --> 01:15:27,357
- Where's the Mean Machine?
- Media guy said it looked flam.

835
01:15:27,556 --> 01:15:29,317
How's this look?

836
01:15:29,516 --> 01:15:31,317
Responsible.

837
01:15:31,516 --> 01:15:34,037
- End of an era!
- Yeah.

838
01:15:37,277 --> 01:15:41,277
When l hear about tax breaks
for big corporations,

839
01:15:41,476 --> 01:15:44,037
l think, ''Why give them a break?''

840
01:15:44,237 --> 01:15:47,877
But unless we attract
new business to this district

841
01:15:48,077 --> 01:15:52,717
and expand our tax base, there won't
be a new senior citizen centre,

842
01:15:52,917 --> 01:15:56,597
or meals-on-wheels
for your housebound friends...

843
01:15:58,436 --> 01:16:01,197
- John Palmeri?
- Yeah?

844
01:16:01,396 --> 01:16:04,917
- Tim Garrity. l'm with Peter.
- How'd you recognise me?

845
01:16:05,117 --> 01:16:06,717
Pete described you.

846
01:16:06,917 --> 01:16:10,397
And you're the only other person here
who can walk.

847
01:16:10,596 --> 01:16:13,237
- He looks good.
- Like a Kennedy.

848
01:16:13,436 --> 01:16:16,397
86 the notes. Get him to memorise.

849
01:16:16,596 --> 01:16:20,917
l keep telling him to.
l wanted to go over strategy with you.

850
01:16:21,117 --> 01:16:23,317
Sure. Get in.

851
01:16:26,877 --> 01:16:32,517
Now he's a candidate, eveything goes
through me. Requests, advice, money.

852
01:16:32,716 --> 01:16:35,757
Sounds good. You ticklish?

853
01:16:35,957 --> 01:16:37,957
- What?
- Some guys are.

854
01:16:42,237 --> 01:16:44,637
Come on, let's go.

855
01:16:50,436 --> 01:16:52,397
- He's chery.
- What?

856
01:16:52,596 --> 01:16:55,797
Careful is happy.
Didn't they teach you that at Justice?

857
01:16:55,997 --> 01:16:58,917
l'm out of there. l work for Peter now.

858
01:16:59,716 --> 01:17:04,037
You never know what's bred
in the bone. Accept my apologies.

859
01:17:04,237 --> 01:17:08,357
- Will you respect me in the morning?
- Speak to me.

860
01:17:14,277 --> 01:17:17,197
lt's a crime that people live like that.

861
01:17:17,396 --> 01:17:22,677
l want to find the superintendent, the
Iandlords. l want some face-to-face now.

862
01:17:22,877 --> 01:17:25,237
How would you do that?

863
01:17:25,436 --> 01:17:28,717
- Can l steal him?
- Just a minute.

864
01:17:28,917 --> 01:17:33,037
Just found out one of Palmeri's
companies owns this property.

865
01:17:33,237 --> 01:17:36,597
- What?
- Back off on your speech.

866
01:17:36,796 --> 01:17:39,757
- What shall l say?
- Don't get specific.

867
01:17:39,957 --> 01:17:42,677
''Tomorrow's looking good.''

868
01:17:57,117 --> 01:17:59,917
- How are you holding up?
- Fine.

869
01:18:00,117 --> 01:18:01,797
Yeah?

870
01:18:01,997 --> 01:18:05,877
You were pretty tight with Burton.
It's got to be rough.

871
01:18:06,877 --> 01:18:10,077
My old man said
that friendship is like the dew.

872
01:18:10,277 --> 01:18:14,917
lt settles on some roses
and it settles on some dog shit.

873
01:18:15,117 --> 01:18:18,477
Record by pressing the first button.
It's also your mike.

874
01:18:18,676 --> 01:18:22,117
- There's a recorder in the shoulder.
- He has a scanner.

875
01:18:22,317 --> 01:18:25,077
Fibre optics. Doesn't register.

876
01:18:26,636 --> 01:18:28,597
Bond. James Bond.

877
01:18:32,197 --> 01:18:34,957
When's your meeting with Palmeri?

878
01:18:35,636 --> 01:18:40,437
- Tomorrow afternoon.
- Want to go over ít agaín?

879
01:18:40,636 --> 01:18:42,717
- Mr Palmeri.
- This way.

880
01:18:42,917 --> 01:18:47,717
Let hím lead, keep ít specífíc, persuade,
don't provoke, always be closíng.

881
01:18:47,917 --> 01:18:50,317
- Hey, Tim.
- How you doing?

882
01:18:50,516 --> 01:18:54,117
Are you sure
you haven't slípped anywhere?

883
01:18:54,317 --> 01:18:56,717
Nobody knows a thíng.

884
01:19:09,676 --> 01:19:13,277
lf it's about playing wifey
at his debate, the answer's no.

885
01:19:13,476 --> 01:19:15,437
- Is that final?
- Yes.

886
01:19:16,476 --> 01:19:19,317
- OK.
- Damn it!

887
01:19:19,516 --> 01:19:22,197
That's why you came here, isn't it?

888
01:19:22,396 --> 01:19:26,077
Reconnaissance on his marriage.
That's really pathetic.

889
01:19:26,277 --> 01:19:30,997
- l said l'd talk to you, that's all.
- You did your job, you can go.

890
01:19:31,197 --> 01:19:35,797
No, you can go. l'm going to stay
and finish my drink.

891
01:19:39,356 --> 01:19:41,237
l'm sory.

892
01:19:47,157 --> 01:19:50,077
- Want something?
- l'd love a double Stoly.

893
01:19:50,277 --> 01:19:53,437
- Double Stoly...
- No, club soda with lime.

894
01:19:53,636 --> 01:19:57,677
- What's that?
- A new trick l'm learning.

895
01:19:57,877 --> 01:20:02,557
Helps me see things for how they are,
instead of how l wish they were.

896
01:20:02,756 --> 01:20:05,597
What do you see?

897
01:20:05,796 --> 01:20:09,637
l see how Peter gets a hold on people.

898
01:20:11,556 --> 01:20:16,277
He's so good at telling you
what you want to hear.

899
01:20:16,476 --> 01:20:20,157
How much we want to believe
eveything he says.

900
01:20:20,356 --> 01:20:24,957
- It's vey powerful.
- It's not just Peter, that's politicians.

901
01:20:25,157 --> 01:20:29,157
Successful ones. You can't condemn
them. It's the nature of the beast.

902
01:20:29,356 --> 01:20:31,917
- Don't condemn him?
- He broke no law.

903
01:20:32,117 --> 01:20:35,117
Any more than your father did
by letting him do it.

904
01:20:35,317 --> 01:20:40,317
lt's a system that's worked
for over 200 years, remember?

905
01:20:40,516 --> 01:20:44,557
l think he had something to do
with setting you up.

906
01:20:44,756 --> 01:20:47,277
He had nothing to do with that.

907
01:20:47,476 --> 01:20:52,597
What are you doing with him?
This isn't you, playing his game.

908
01:20:52,796 --> 01:20:54,717
l am sory you got hurt.

909
01:20:54,917 --> 01:20:58,517
But just because
he wasn't your goddamn perfect man

910
01:20:58,716 --> 01:21:01,837
doesn't mean
l have to cut him off, too.

911
01:21:02,037 --> 01:21:05,877
l am helping out an old friend,
that is all.

912
01:21:11,516 --> 01:21:15,957
- You don't understand.
- No, l don't understand.

913
01:21:16,157 --> 01:21:18,197
You're right.

914
01:21:29,957 --> 01:21:32,797
Diana, be there on election night.

915
01:21:34,436 --> 01:21:40,117
Bring that bottle of champagne you
bet him, 'cause l think he might win.

916
01:21:41,636 --> 01:21:46,397
And bring a little faith in me.
You won't be disappointed.

917
01:21:49,837 --> 01:21:54,197
Good eveníng and welcome
bach to Election '90 at Channel 3.

926
01:22:30,957 --> 01:22:33,917
Turníng back
to the Congressíonal electíon...

927
01:22:34,117 --> 01:22:35,997
Shomime!

930
01:22:48,476 --> 01:22:52,837
We now project
Peter Burton to be the wínner

931
01:22:53,037 --> 01:22:56,517
by a narrow margín
over Kevín McQuade.

932
01:23:05,556 --> 01:23:06,837
Come here!

933
01:23:07,037 --> 01:23:10,237
- Congratulations, Mrs Burton.
- Thank you.

934
01:23:13,716 --> 01:23:18,237
Come here! We fucking did it, man!

935
01:23:20,676 --> 01:23:22,357
lt's great!

936
01:23:30,877 --> 01:23:33,117
Way to go, Pete!

937
01:23:33,317 --> 01:23:34,677
Pardon me.

938
01:23:38,516 --> 01:23:40,637
A bet's a bet.

939
01:23:42,077 --> 01:23:43,677
Congratulations.

940
01:23:46,476 --> 01:23:49,837
Listen, Diana,
maybe we can sort things out.

941
01:23:50,037 --> 01:23:52,237
No, Peter.

942
01:23:53,436 --> 01:23:55,397
l've filed for a divorce.

943
01:23:55,596 --> 01:23:58,437
McQuade's on the phone.
He's ready to concede.

944
01:23:58,636 --> 01:24:00,597
ln a minute. Diana.

945
01:24:00,796 --> 01:24:04,797
Go ahead. You've been waiting
for this moment your whole life.

946
01:24:04,997 --> 01:24:08,637
Don't start getting regretful.
It's not your style.

947
01:24:13,596 --> 01:24:16,757
Peter, come on. This is it!

948
01:24:16,957 --> 01:24:19,477
Kevin. Thank you.

949
01:24:22,476 --> 01:24:25,237
What was l supposed to have faith in?

950
01:24:25,436 --> 01:24:29,077
Sometimes the system works
and people are what you'd hoped.

951
01:24:29,277 --> 01:24:30,997
l've lost the faith.

952
01:24:31,197 --> 01:24:34,557
Did you know Peter
set me up, or just suspect?

953
01:24:34,756 --> 01:24:37,397
- What?
- Did Palmeri ask him?

954
01:24:37,596 --> 01:24:40,837
Or did he iust offer me up?

955
01:24:41,037 --> 01:24:45,317
Oh, God. You've known all along.

956
01:24:45,516 --> 01:24:49,717
- Long enough to do something about it.
- Tonight?

957
01:24:49,917 --> 01:24:52,517
The fat lady's warming up.

958
01:24:55,317 --> 01:24:57,877
l'll see you down there.

959
01:24:59,556 --> 01:25:04,677
Peter's accepting in about 20 minutes.
We'll see you in the ballroom.

960
01:25:04,877 --> 01:25:08,237
- Eveybody out. Give him some air.
- As your new Congressman,

961
01:25:08,436 --> 01:25:11,797
l propose you all go downstairs
and get a drink.

962
01:25:18,197 --> 01:25:20,077
See you later.

963
01:25:20,277 --> 01:25:22,997
- See you down there.
- All right.

964
01:26:01,997 --> 01:26:04,557
Seven years, my friend.

965
01:26:04,756 --> 01:26:07,957
- Bet settled.
- Unbelievable.

966
01:26:08,157 --> 01:26:13,717
This stuff's a lot more expensive
than it was in 1 983, l'll tell you that.

967
01:26:16,636 --> 01:26:21,357
We may not always get
what we want or what we need,

968
01:26:21,556 --> 01:26:24,557
just so's we don't get
what we deserve.

969
01:26:24,756 --> 01:26:28,117
- Congratulations, Congressman.
- Thanks, brother.

970
01:26:36,917 --> 01:26:41,077
No, no. Hey, l appreciate it, really.

971
01:26:42,237 --> 01:26:44,837
All right. Give me 15 minutes.

972
01:26:51,997 --> 01:26:56,837
- Where the hell's Palmerí?
- l thought he'd watch hís horse come ín.

973
01:26:57,037 --> 01:27:00,557
He's goíng away. Maybe he's choosíng
whích 100 suíts to take.

974
01:27:00,756 --> 01:27:04,437
Shoes to match. What does he do
at hís constructíon sítes?

975
01:27:04,636 --> 01:27:08,957
- Do they vacuum before he arríves?
- That's íf he ever arríves.

976
01:27:10,037 --> 01:27:12,277
Some píece of work.

977
01:27:12,476 --> 01:27:17,477
- Please! You don't know the half of ít.
- How much do you know?

978
01:27:17,676 --> 01:27:22,557
More than you. He's got
a hammer-lock on a few union locals.

979
01:27:22,756 --> 01:27:25,917
You don't run a carting company
without John as partner.

980
01:27:26,117 --> 01:27:30,277
His wife's got a ''catering service''
with half the state's hospitals.

981
01:27:30,476 --> 01:27:36,717
- Bitch wouldn't know Jell-O from steak.
- How do you do it? l'd be nervous.

982
01:27:36,917 --> 01:27:40,317
- We got an arrangement.
- Go along, get along?

983
01:27:40,516 --> 01:27:44,277
- He knows the parameters.
- What if he changes them?

984
01:27:44,476 --> 01:27:49,157
lt won't happen. l'm not a puny
Iocal official taking envelopes.

985
01:27:49,356 --> 01:27:54,717
- What do you mean?
- l'll tell you a stoy. Town supervisor,

986
01:27:54,917 --> 01:27:59,317
l forgot where, reneges on a variance
for one of John's developments.

987
01:27:59,516 --> 01:28:04,077
Comes home one night,
found his house burnt down.

988
01:28:05,556 --> 01:28:08,557
Didn't even let the dog out.

989
01:28:10,396 --> 01:28:12,917
Come on, let's drink up.

990
01:28:13,837 --> 01:28:16,677
l got a lot of people to thank.

991
01:28:22,037 --> 01:28:25,637
How did he get so much money
into the campaign?

992
01:28:25,837 --> 01:28:30,637
Holding companies, brothers-in-law,
friends. Man's got a lot of friends.

993
01:28:31,396 --> 01:28:33,637
And you owe them all?

994
01:28:36,997 --> 01:28:39,397
Yeah, l owe them all.

995
01:28:39,596 --> 01:28:43,117
Now l'm elected, l'll take care of them.
My time, my way.

996
01:28:44,436 --> 01:28:47,757
Just leave the dog with a neighbour.

997
01:28:50,917 --> 01:28:54,077
What do you owe them right now?

998
01:28:59,237 --> 01:29:03,117
- What is this?
- What's what?

999
01:29:04,396 --> 01:29:06,637
All these questions about Palmeri?

1000
01:29:14,237 --> 01:29:18,397
What's with you
not looking me in the eye?

1001
01:29:32,636 --> 01:29:35,557
Palmeri's being arraigned right now.

1002
01:29:35,756 --> 01:29:40,037
They're gonna nail you for
accepting illegal kickbacks, conspiracy

1003
01:29:40,237 --> 01:29:42,197
and obstruction of iustice.

1004
01:29:49,436 --> 01:29:52,317
You son of a bitch!

1005
01:29:52,516 --> 01:29:56,637
You set me up at Justice.
Why did you do that to me?

1006
01:29:56,837 --> 01:30:00,637
That's a lie.
l'll deny we ever had this conversation.

1007
01:30:00,837 --> 01:30:03,157
Yes, we did. Say ''cheese''.

1008
01:30:11,837 --> 01:30:16,677
Fuck you!
Come on, tell me about justice!

1009
01:30:19,356 --> 01:30:22,997
Tell me it has nothing to do
with me getting Diana.

1010
01:30:23,197 --> 01:30:26,597
Tell me this isn't about me
coming out ahead of you.

1011
01:30:26,796 --> 01:30:30,117
Get up, you self-righteous
son of a...

1012
01:30:44,957 --> 01:30:50,277
lt's easy for you to screw people.
If eveyone's out for you, then it's OK.

1013
01:30:50,957 --> 01:30:52,357
Garrity! FBl !

1014
01:30:52,556 --> 01:30:55,317
Get out!

1015
01:31:13,077 --> 01:31:15,797
l'm sory for what l did to you.

1016
01:31:15,997 --> 01:31:18,757
- l had no choice.
- Course you did.

1017
01:31:18,957 --> 01:31:22,957
l got instinct and some moves.
Choice is for guys like you.

1018
01:31:23,157 --> 01:31:25,917
Diana married you.

1019
01:31:26,117 --> 01:31:30,397
You chose to make her regret it
with eveything that you had.

1020
01:31:32,077 --> 01:31:37,077
Stiles took you under his wing
and you chose to blackmail him.

1021
01:31:37,277 --> 01:31:42,077
l was your friend
and you chose to betray me.

1022
01:31:48,476 --> 01:31:50,997
You did this to yourself.

1023
01:31:56,197 --> 01:31:57,757
Why?

1024
01:32:16,636 --> 01:32:22,517
l needed more than you could give,
you or Diana or any one person.

1025
01:32:27,596 --> 01:32:31,557
They say great men are embraced
by thousands of strangers.

1026
01:32:31,756 --> 01:32:33,997
l want to be great.

1027
01:32:36,317 --> 01:32:40,397
So you sacrificed a few
to reach the many.

1028
01:32:47,756 --> 01:32:50,517
They believe in me down there.

1029
01:32:50,756 --> 01:32:57,037
And you can't take that away.
They won't let you.

1030
01:33:35,037 --> 01:33:37,077
Thank you.

1031
01:33:37,277 --> 01:33:39,317
Thank you.

1032
01:33:39,516 --> 01:33:43,837
You know, for the past couple
of months, l've been saying

1033
01:33:44,077 --> 01:33:46,077
tomorrow's looking good.

1034
01:33:48,277 --> 01:33:51,477
l'll tell you a secret,
tonight's feeling great.

1035
01:33:53,756 --> 01:33:58,877
First of all, l want to thank
my campaign family.

1036
01:33:59,077 --> 01:34:05,077
Because of your fantastic dedication
and energy, we're here tonight.

1037
01:34:07,516 --> 01:34:12,237
With your hopes and dreams in our
hearts, we're going to Washington.

1038
01:34:16,636 --> 01:34:21,477
ln the past few months, as l've met
the fíne people of thís dístríct,

1039
01:34:21,676 --> 01:34:27,397
l've come to thínk of you not just
as voters, but as famíly, as fríends.

1040
01:34:31,117 --> 01:34:33,877
And that's how l want you to thínk of me.

1041
01:34:34,077 --> 01:34:39,837
As your friend in Washington,
as your brother in Congress.

1042
01:34:40,037 --> 01:34:44,477
l'm listening,
and what's more, l hear you.

1043
01:35:20,636 --> 01:35:22,917
One of the questions

1044
01:35:24,117 --> 01:35:28,797
l've been asked, over and over again
during the campaign...

1045
01:35:31,396 --> 01:35:34,677
...is, ''Peter Burton,

1046
01:35:34,877 --> 01:35:37,957
''why should l trust you?

1047
01:35:39,117 --> 01:35:42,717
''Why should l believe in you?''

1048
01:35:44,356 --> 01:35:46,877
lt's a tough question.

1049
01:35:48,997 --> 01:35:54,077
The tough answer is because l'm not
afraid to admit that l'm human.

1050
01:35:56,636 --> 01:35:58,917
l'm one of you.

1051
01:36:00,436 --> 01:36:04,477
l'm motivated, l'm proud,

1052
01:36:04,676 --> 01:36:08,677
l'm competitive and, yeah,
sometimes l'm a little headstrong.

1053
01:36:08,877 --> 01:36:13,317
- Does that sound familiar?
- Yes!

1054
01:36:13,516 --> 01:36:16,877
l'm one of you.
And l'll tell you something.

1055
01:36:17,077 --> 01:36:19,797
Where there's an ''Us'' there's a ''Them''.

1056
01:36:19,997 --> 01:36:22,997
ln smom back rooms,
here in our district,

1057
01:36:23,197 --> 01:36:27,037
they're trading on our tomorrows
for their own gain.

1058
01:36:29,356 --> 01:36:31,957
ln the past few months...

1059
01:36:34,556 --> 01:36:37,997
...one of these men invited me in,

1060
01:36:39,676 --> 01:36:42,437
and l let him think l was for sale.

1061
01:36:42,636 --> 01:36:45,357
Not Peter Burton!

1062
01:36:47,676 --> 01:36:51,077
As you'll soon find out,

1063
01:36:51,277 --> 01:36:53,237
l was so good at it

1064
01:36:53,436 --> 01:36:57,837
that some lanyers from Washington
really thought l was for sale.

1065
01:36:59,237 --> 01:37:01,917
That's the case they'll ty to make.

1066
01:37:03,837 --> 01:37:08,677
l put it to you, was l too motivated?
Is it possible?

1067
01:37:08,877 --> 01:37:11,837
Too headstrong? Perhaps.

1068
01:37:14,077 --> 01:37:17,437
Less than circumspect? Definitely.

1069
01:37:20,716 --> 01:37:24,517
But l did what
any one of you would've done.

1070
01:37:25,676 --> 01:37:29,237
Tell it to the people
who can't find a home.

1071
01:37:31,157 --> 01:37:35,277
Tell it to the people
who can't find a decent job,

1072
01:37:36,636 --> 01:37:40,597
who can't send their children
to decent schools.

1073
01:37:47,957 --> 01:37:49,917
l did what you would've done.

1074
01:37:50,117 --> 01:37:55,437
l saw an opportunity to get a jump on
these guys, and l seized it.

1075
01:37:55,636 --> 01:38:00,997
l took that risk for one reason.
l took that risk for you.

1076
01:38:03,077 --> 01:38:05,677
We love you, Peter!

1077
01:38:12,997 --> 01:38:17,997
ln the hopes that one day
l would be here with you at my side,

1078
01:38:18,197 --> 01:38:22,517
to take back our tomorrows from
these crooks and these schemers,

1079
01:38:22,716 --> 01:38:25,637
and to send a message to Washington

1080
01:38:25,837 --> 01:38:28,997
that we're in charge
and tomorrow's looking good!

1081
01:38:44,157 --> 01:38:46,677
Garríty's on hís way down.

1082
01:38:47,837 --> 01:38:50,517
Here he comes.

1083
01:38:50,716 --> 01:38:52,957
A damn good iob.

1084
01:38:57,077 --> 01:38:59,357
- Ready?
- He's in his suite.

1085
01:38:59,556 --> 01:39:04,037
Let him call his lanyer,
then bring him down the back way.

1086
01:39:07,636 --> 01:39:10,477
- Good work.
- Get enough?

1087
01:39:10,676 --> 01:39:14,837
- Plenty.
- Good. That's good.

1088
01:39:17,596 --> 01:39:20,357
- You OK?
- Fine. Wish he'd lost.

1089
01:39:20,556 --> 01:39:23,837
Spare him humiliation
on the front page.

1090
01:39:24,037 --> 01:39:28,357
Win or lose, he's front page. If not you,
it would've been somebody else.

1091
01:39:28,556 --> 01:39:30,877
But it is me.

1092
01:39:31,077 --> 01:39:34,877
He was my best friend
and l used that to fuck him.

1093
01:39:35,077 --> 01:39:38,117
Just like he did to you. You're even.

1094
01:39:38,317 --> 01:39:44,757
You signed on to Justice all full of fire
to set things right. And you're good.

1095
01:39:44,957 --> 01:39:50,277
But until tonight, it never cost you.
You don't own it until it costs you.

1096
01:39:51,556 --> 01:39:54,197
They're bringing him down.

1097
01:40:43,636 --> 01:40:46,757
lf l lost,
l'd bring you a case of champagne.

1098
01:40:46,957 --> 01:40:53,237
Well, l got elected, but doesn't look
like l'm going to get sworn in.

1099
01:40:54,556 --> 01:40:57,397
So, there's the champagne. Bet settled.

1100
01:41:04,037 --> 01:41:07,117
l'm sory it ended up like this.

1101
01:41:07,317 --> 01:41:11,757
- l second that.
- What are you going to do?

1102
01:41:12,676 --> 01:41:16,397
They offered me immunity
if l testify against Palmeri.

1103
01:41:16,596 --> 01:41:19,957
Nobody said anything
about immunity from Palmeri.

1104
01:41:20,157 --> 01:41:26,637
Or l can take my chances. l heard
you took yourself off the case. Thanks.

1105
01:41:26,837 --> 01:41:31,637
- No deal and l'll have to testify.
- l know.

1106
01:41:33,117 --> 01:41:36,797
- l've got to get going.
- Yeah.

1107
01:41:38,197 --> 01:41:42,957
But save a bottle of that champagne.
We'll make it an ongoing bet.

1108
01:41:44,636 --> 01:41:47,717
You know the old saying
in Washington.

1109
01:41:47,917 --> 01:41:51,597
Only two things can
truly wreck a man's political career:

1110
01:41:51,796 --> 01:41:55,477
getting caught with a live boy
or a dead girl.

1111
01:41:59,516 --> 01:42:03,477
- Good luck, Pete.
- See you around campus, man.
