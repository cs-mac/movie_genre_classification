1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,411
BASED ON REAL FACTS

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,611
Each morning as
I rode the streetcar to work

3
00:00:12,112 --> 00:00:15,184
I watched them put together
the great steel figures.

4
00:00:18,885 --> 00:00:21,451
The Second World War
had broken out in Europe.

5
00:00:22,191 --> 00:00:24,998
Our capitalist enemies
were killing each other.

6
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:29,327
And as I looked at these statues,
I imagined that our Master

7
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,365
had ordered them built
to show the invincibility

8
00:00:32,445 --> 00:00:35,318
of our socialist motherland.

9
00:00:39,397 --> 00:00:42,108
The man we called
" Master " was one of the heroes

10
00:00:42,373 --> 00:00:44,666
who created our Workers' State.

11
00:00:45,638 --> 00:00:47,181
He was more than our ruler.

12
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,093
He was Father to all of us!

13
00:00:51,523 --> 00:00:54,996
- Every factory worker
and every peasant woman.

14
00:00:56,386 --> 00:01:00,178
His name was Joseph Stalin.

15
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:03,983
Which in Russian, meant
"Man of Steel".

16
00:01:09,641 --> 00:01:14,889
Moscow - 1939

17
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,436
Increase volunteers to help the Red Army

18
00:01:43,267 --> 00:01:45,103
The Soviets are ready to contribute

19
00:01:45,322 --> 00:01:47,598
to the defense of our Great Motherland.

20
00:01:49,148 --> 00:01:52,637
The workers of culture and science
request that iintelligentsia

21
00:01:53,151 --> 00:01:54,867
launch all their force and energy

22
00:01:55,117 --> 00:01:57,426
to master modern chemical defense!

23
00:01:58,523 --> 00:02:01,452
No Soviet man must be
without his own gas mask.

24
00:02:02,326 --> 00:02:04,077
This is the slogan of our time.

25
00:02:04,929 --> 00:02:07,221
Not a single day
without a gas mask!

26
00:02:07,897 --> 00:02:11,468
This is what the progressive workers
of plant #23 call for!

27
00:02:12,525 --> 00:02:14,866
And this slogan is picked up by the masses.

28
00:02:16,117 --> 00:02:17,845
Today, you can spot a gas mask

29
00:02:18,126 --> 00:02:19,439
in the street and in the library,

30
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,670
on a ballet stage
and in the ambulance

31
00:02:23,292 --> 00:02:24,686
The modern Soviet gas mask

32
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,302
is easy to handle

33
00:02:26,741 --> 00:02:27,800
and efficient in use.

34
00:02:28,017 --> 00:02:29,953
For the first time in the world,
Professor Petrov

35
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,511
performed an operation
with a gas mask on his face.

36
00:02:33,944 --> 00:02:35,551
In the Kremlin, the best volunteers

37
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:37,303
demonstrated their mastership

38
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,310
to the Minister of Defense,
comrade Voroshilov.

39
00:02:41,109 --> 00:02:45,100
It took them only 3  1/2 seconds
to be in complete--

40
00:02:45,397 --> 00:02:47,518
I was a film projectionist
for the KGB.

41
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,700
I had the best corner of the room
in an apartment

42
00:02:51,373 --> 00:02:52,690
on Slaughterhouse St.

43
00:02:53,528 --> 00:02:55,648
and I was about to marry

44
00:02:55,718 --> 00:02:58,286
the most beautiful girl
I had ever known.

45
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,651
To your wedding!

46
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,652
30,000 sportsmen

47
00:03:11,922 --> 00:03:14,900
demonstrated their
physical fitness

48
00:03:15,213 --> 00:03:16,753
at the Red Square to Stalin

49
00:03:17,354 --> 00:03:19,284
The best friend to Soviet athletes.

50
00:03:21,404 --> 00:03:24,709
The 'Day of an athlete',
favorite holiday of the Soviet People

51
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:27,675
is a celebration of
youth and health.

52
00:03:28,815 --> 00:03:32,040
Comrade Stalin and his
brother in arms, comrade Voroshilov...

53
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:35,522
take pride in the growth
of the young generation.

54
00:03:36,692 --> 00:03:38,145
Now, to my bride!

55
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,464
The folk music of all
Soviet Republic builders

56
00:03:45,803 --> 00:03:48,096
does not cease all day at the Red Square.

57
00:03:50,451 --> 00:03:53,539
Triumphant fanfares and colorful dances...

58
00:03:54,538 --> 00:03:58,046
flowers and smiles,
courage and strength.

59
00:03:59,235 --> 00:04:01,733
This is the motto of the Soviet youth

60
00:04:02,091 --> 00:04:06,569
At any time, ready to stand for the defense
of the Soviet motherland.

61
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,021
The Red Army is replenished

62
00:04:16,349 --> 00:04:19,036
with athletes excellent
in physical fitness.

63
00:04:20,034 --> 00:04:21,618
The slogan is heard over
this square

64
00:04:22,605 --> 00:04:24,318
Glory to the Soviet athletes!

65
00:04:25,033 --> 00:04:29,286
Glory to the Soviet people
and its great leader...

66
00:05:10,237 --> 00:05:12,046
Slaughterhouse: Next stop
Next stop: Slaughterhouse

67
00:05:44,808 --> 00:05:46,770
Anastasia, you're getting married today!

68
00:05:50,048 --> 00:05:51,059
Having some guests?

69
00:05:51,962 --> 00:05:53,847
Yes! Everyone in the apartment is invited.

70
00:05:54,594 --> 00:05:55,578
You're coming?

71
00:05:55,984 --> 00:05:57,627
Why didn't you say so earlier?

72
00:05:57,714 --> 00:05:59,028
I wouldn't have cooked all this shit.

73
00:05:59,615 --> 00:06:00,851
No one said anything to me.

74
00:06:01,081 --> 00:06:02,426
I told your wife.

75
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,909
She didn't say a word to me

76
00:06:06,872 --> 00:06:08,947
Professor, I know you don't like
parties,

77
00:06:09,337 --> 00:06:10,708
but please join us tonight!

78
00:06:12,322 --> 00:06:13,986
Everyone in the apartment is invited!

79
00:06:14,202 --> 00:06:15,480
And you must come!

80
00:06:18,787 --> 00:06:20,168
Have you got a resident's permit yet?

81
00:06:20,771 --> 00:06:21,958
No, it's difficult!

82
00:06:22,344 --> 00:06:23,207
We can help!

83
00:06:23,692 --> 00:06:24,911
The police can always be of help.

84
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:28,860
Why don't you pop
into my room sometime, huh?

85
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,637
My wife works at night.

86
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:32,118
But watch out-

87
00:06:32,406 --> 00:06:34,551
The other tenants in this
shithole cannot be trusted.

88
00:06:34,871 --> 00:06:36,570
Especially the Jews!

89
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,848
Comrade Morda!
Will you help us with the gramophone?

90
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:41,497
Everything you have is foreign..

91
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,182
The gramophone, even
the cat is foreign..

92
00:06:44,493 --> 00:06:46,789
Uh-huh. Well! If you were
sent to work abroad for two years

93
00:06:47,123 --> 00:06:49,952
comrade Morda, you too would have
everything of foreign make!

94
00:06:50,763 --> 00:06:51,888
What's wrong with Soviet goods?

95
00:06:54,387 --> 00:06:55,791
Katya, come on!

96
00:06:56,502 --> 00:06:57,502
Come!

97
00:07:32,331 --> 00:07:35,382
Kiss her! Kiss her!

98
00:07:35,792 --> 00:07:37,508
Come on! A kiss!

99
00:07:40,222 --> 00:07:40,987
Oh, sweet!

100
00:07:41,392 --> 00:07:42,392
Sweeter?

101
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:45,762
Sweeter, sweeter, sweeter!

102
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:49,690
Another toast!

103
00:07:50,537 --> 00:07:52,495
Fill your glasses!
Everyone!

104
00:07:52,936 --> 00:07:54,606
This fool makes me sick!

105
00:07:54,872 --> 00:07:57,027
Shut your trap old woman!
You have no right!

106
00:07:57,881 --> 00:07:59,189
You know friend Gubelman...

107
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:03,644
all these warehouses and slaughterhouses
once belonged to this witch.

108
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:06,729
This blood-sucker
exploited poor people

109
00:08:06,964 --> 00:08:08,851
and now we are the bosses!

110
00:08:09,065 --> 00:08:11,771
And now we allow her to
live behind the wardrobe

111
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,005
and even Sanshin's room!

112
00:08:13,653 --> 00:08:14,468
And now we tell her

113
00:08:14,468 --> 00:08:19,556
Shut up! shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up!

114
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:25,664
Rise and Toast!

115
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:36,864
Let's drink to comrade
Voroshilov!

116
00:08:37,363 --> 00:08:38,631
We have toasted to him!

117
00:08:39,033 --> 00:08:40,945
What? You can't drink
twice to this great man!?

118
00:08:41,653 --> 00:08:43,528
Me??
He is my hero!

119
00:08:43,638 --> 00:08:45,851
For our people, the Commisar of Defense?

120
00:08:46,198 --> 00:08:48,113
-the military genius of the century!

121
00:08:48,424 --> 00:08:52,589
When lead by Voroshilov,
a first rate official

122
00:08:52,924 --> 00:08:55,664
-we once made
our plot for the USSR!

123
00:08:56,462 --> 00:08:58,892
Comrade Voroshilov

124
00:09:01,686 --> 00:09:03,264
Look out!
You'll ruin it!

125
00:09:03,702 --> 00:09:04,326
Sit down!

126
00:09:05,887 --> 00:09:06,808
Listen, comrades.

127
00:09:08,427 --> 00:09:10,282
Let's toast to our chief,

128
00:09:11,066 --> 00:09:12,609
our father, comrade Stalin.

129
00:09:28,191 --> 00:09:29,568
We'll put the little one
to bed now!

130
00:09:29,914 --> 00:09:31,671
Good night! Good night!

131
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,947
Thank you!
Aaron, Sonia.

132
00:09:35,152 --> 00:09:36,841
Good night, Katya.

133
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:42,094
Oh, look at this!

134
00:09:42,753 --> 00:09:45,268
You smeared Voroshilov's
picture with your greasy lips!

135
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:46,783
Hey, you city slicker!

136
00:09:47,229 --> 00:09:49,118
Look how Soviet peasants dance!

137
00:09:54,623 --> 00:09:55,909
Keep your paws off the bride!

138
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:57,961
Shut up, you old bag!
You ignored the toast to Stalin.

139
00:09:58,321 --> 00:09:59,240
I don't miss a thing!

140
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:14,076
What Is This??!

141
00:10:16,004 --> 00:10:17,169
It is our wedding party!

142
00:10:17,338 --> 00:10:18,495
Come in join us!

143
00:10:19,306 --> 00:10:20,348
Aren't you working tomorrow?

144
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:22,844
Sooo? I am!

145
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,906
Thank you!

146
00:10:33,393 --> 00:10:35,500
Good night, comrade
newlyweds!

147
00:10:37,097 --> 00:10:40,098
Ouch! That hurts you bitch!

148
00:10:44,913 --> 00:10:49,223
You think I'm crazy?
Listen to you. You're a drunk...

149
00:10:49,623 --> 00:10:54,623
I'm the one who works!
And you, all you do is drink!

150
00:11:23,696 --> 00:11:25,407
Lord, forgive us our sins.

151
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:44,990
It's multiple rings-
It's for the Gubelmans.

152
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:48,284
Are you Gubelman?

153
00:11:48,534 --> 00:11:49,569
Aaron Mikhilovitch?

154
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,561
Yes, it's me!

155
00:11:51,789 --> 00:11:52,964
We have a warrant
for your arrest!

156
00:11:53,474 --> 00:11:54,514
And a warrant to
search your room!

157
00:11:55,057 --> 00:11:56,376
- Who are you?
- Only a tenent.

158
00:11:57,699 --> 00:11:59,257
Get a second tenant for a witness.

159
00:12:00,272 --> 00:12:03,151
Ivan, get up
you're wanted!

160
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:05,525
Yeah.. Coming.

161
00:12:30,345 --> 00:12:31,772
Photos depicting Gubelman...

162
00:12:32,545 --> 00:12:34,389
surrounded by Nazi officers..

163
00:12:35,295 --> 00:12:37,030
His commissions are official!

164
00:12:37,935 --> 00:12:38,865
18 photographs.

165
00:12:41,148 --> 00:12:42,661
Lady, please pick up the child.

166
00:12:43,689 --> 00:12:45,213
Letters in foreign languages.

167
00:12:45,669 --> 00:12:47,228
The child must be removed from the bed.

168
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:48,590
More letters.

169
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,339
Give it to me.

170
00:13:08,677 --> 00:13:10,321
A toy of foreign make..

171
00:13:10,504 --> 00:13:12,298
depicting a woman.

172
00:13:13,344 --> 00:13:14,510
with a red nose.

173
00:13:15,274 --> 00:13:16,117
Make a note of it.

174
00:13:18,582 --> 00:13:19,186
What!!

175
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:20,474
Grab him!

176
00:13:21,514 --> 00:13:22,390
YOU Idiot!

177
00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:25,161
DO YOU WANT TO END UP IN A CAMP??!!??

178
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:26,851
I told you to watch the JEW!!

179
00:13:27,359 --> 00:13:28,084
Stupid Moron!

180
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:28,965
Idiot!

181
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:33,762
Go on, I won't let you
die Gubelman! Get him in the car!

182
00:13:40,795 --> 00:13:42,755
Go! I'll see you at headquarters

183
00:14:12,773 --> 00:14:14,383
Sonia! Listen!

184
00:14:17,532 --> 00:14:19,155
I'm showing films to the KGB club.

185
00:14:19,547 --> 00:14:20,857
I know some people there.

186
00:14:21,358 --> 00:14:25,632
One time I even saw the headman,
Comrade Beria, himself!

187
00:14:26,128 --> 00:14:29,143
So tomorrow.. no today...!

188
00:14:38,858 --> 00:14:40,673
It's for us!

189
00:14:42,995 --> 00:14:44,462
Stay calm, I'll get it.

190
00:14:49,015 --> 00:14:50,370
Comrade Sanshin?

191
00:14:50,665 --> 00:14:51,660
Sir!

192
00:14:52,335 --> 00:14:53,300
Are you a projectionist?

193
00:14:53,545 --> 00:14:55,192
Yes sir - KGB club.

194
00:14:57,004 --> 00:14:58,848
You'll be coming with us.
Get dressed and no questions!

195
00:14:59,484 --> 00:15:00,389
Where are you taking me?

196
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:02,750
No questions!!
We must leave immediately!

197
00:15:03,187 --> 00:15:05,432
You're making a mistake!
I've done nothing wrong!

198
00:15:06,117 --> 00:15:07,607
I've had no contact with foreigners.

199
00:15:07,802 --> 00:15:09,142
Good boy!

200
00:15:10,032 --> 00:15:12,081
It was Gubelman who lived
in the foreign countries!

201
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:13,207
But not me.

202
00:15:13,447 --> 00:15:15,271
I was in the Red Army-Special Forces.

203
00:15:15,991 --> 00:15:17,697
Fighting class enemies!

204
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,478
It smells like vodka.

205
00:15:28,158 --> 00:15:29,171
I got married today.

206
00:16:19,901 --> 00:16:21,065
We're going to the Kremlin?

207
00:16:21,991 --> 00:16:23,246
Smart guy.

208
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:28,388
Is it for the scorching of the film?

209
00:16:29,265 --> 00:16:30,349
You know- his face...

210
00:16:31,496 --> 00:16:32,590
It wasn't my fault.

211
00:16:33,165 --> 00:16:34,304
It's just that kind of film.

212
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,502
This one's with us.

213
00:16:36,555 --> 00:16:38,168
Here's his passport
and pass.

214
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,576
We're just in time.

215
00:17:24,899 --> 00:17:26,300
Listen fellow,
can't you stand up?

216
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:28,026
Yeah, sure!

217
00:17:52,537 --> 00:17:53,770
That's not my projectionist!

218
00:17:54,266 --> 00:17:55,841
Sorry. It's the one from the KGB club.

219
00:17:57,954 --> 00:17:59,661
Comrade general,
here is the man.

220
00:18:01,959 --> 00:18:03,054
Ivan Sanshin?

221
00:18:03,054 --> 00:18:04,094
Yes, sir!

222
00:18:04,094 --> 00:18:05,314
Member of the Communist League?

223
00:18:05,314 --> 00:18:05,899
Yes, sir!

224
00:18:05,899 --> 00:18:06,654
Parents?

225
00:18:06,654 --> 00:18:08,231
None. I am an orphan.

226
00:18:08,524 --> 00:18:10,769
How long have you been
working as a projectionist?

227
00:18:10,769 --> 00:18:13,766
Seven years, and that's why
I say the scorching of

228
00:18:13,766 --> 00:18:16,161
Comrade Stalin's face wasn't
my fault, Comrade General.

229
00:18:16,416 --> 00:18:17,961
Breathe!

230
00:18:23,293 --> 00:18:24,618
****** Idiots!

231
00:18:26,013 --> 00:18:27,735
WHAT'S THIS YOU BROUGHT ME?!??

232
00:18:28,219 --> 00:18:29,917
I was ordered to get him, but
General I--

233
00:18:30,133 --> 00:18:33,632
He stinks!
How the * is he going to show the films!

234
00:18:34,108 --> 00:18:35,283
Comrade General!

235
00:18:37,111 --> 00:18:39,801
If we're talking about showing films
in my business I'm an ace.

236
00:18:40,101 --> 00:18:42,861
I can take apart and put together
any unit with my eyes closed.

237
00:18:44,111 --> 00:18:45,458
We will see!

238
00:19:07,111 --> 00:19:08,202
Well?
-So....

239
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:15,726
You have Mitchells, 1929 model
arc lamp, KBC10... 84

240
00:19:17,213 --> 00:19:18,335
Load it up.

241
00:19:43,904 --> 00:19:44,970
Comrade General

242
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:47,450
Please proceed to the
screening room.

243
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,070
See that?

244
00:19:52,294 --> 00:19:54,066
When you've worked here for five years

245
00:19:54,224 --> 00:19:56,059
and you only learned
how to report on errors!

246
00:19:57,866 --> 00:19:59,799
You know, my projectionist fell sick

247
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,826
and the Master wanted to see a film.

248
00:20:04,324 --> 00:20:05,977
Do you know who is going to see a film?

249
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:07,888
Who?

250
00:20:07,964 --> 00:20:09,624
Him. Stalin!

251
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:12,767
You'll roll the film
for Comrade Stalin.

252
00:20:31,361 --> 00:20:33,144
Make him some tea-
The strongest!

253
00:20:35,448 --> 00:20:36,517
Stalin?

254
00:20:40,618 --> 00:20:42,098
No, no, no...

255
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,021
I, I, I...

256
00:20:45,058 --> 00:20:47,558
.. you better... please...

257
00:20:49,104 --> 00:20:50,168
Drink! Drink!

258
00:20:56,309 --> 00:20:57,389
Too nervous..

259
00:20:57,829 --> 00:20:59,927
What do you expect?
Most of them piss their pants!

260
00:21:06,051 --> 00:21:07,093
Sir!

261
00:21:12,962 --> 00:21:15,292
The show is canceled.
The Master's going to the residence!

262
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,660
Sign here.

263
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,223
Don't you care to read what you've signed?

264
00:21:31,365 --> 00:21:34,135
You've pledged to observe
the secrecy of classified information!

265
00:21:34,154 --> 00:21:36,673
If you plead, you're dead!
Got it?

266
00:21:44,274 --> 00:21:45,889
Looks like we'll meet you again!

267
00:21:46,353 --> 00:21:48,878
The General seemed to like you!

268
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,163
Comrade Stalin!

269
00:22:19,725 --> 00:22:21,241
We live to see another day!!

270
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:34,345
Shhh!
Don't cry.

271
00:22:37,637 --> 00:22:39,094
Ivan is home!

272
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:43,547
See I told you it would
work out. They let him go!!

273
00:22:43,871 --> 00:22:46,508
I know Aaron will come home to you
as they have let go Ivan!

274
00:22:46,592 --> 00:22:48,929
It's only a matter of time
before they let him go!

275
00:22:49,307 --> 00:22:50,517
Yeah sure

276
00:23:37,747 --> 00:23:39,427
Welcome, Sanshin.

277
00:23:39,427 --> 00:23:42,697
You must know
you've been invited here.

278
00:23:42,697 --> 00:23:44,742
We want to offer you a job.

279
00:23:44,987 --> 00:23:46,534
- the projectionist-

280
00:23:47,432 --> 00:23:49,212
in the Kremlin.

281
00:23:52,067 --> 00:23:53,687
Please be seated.

282
00:23:55,542 --> 00:23:58,539
Now.. about your salary..

283
00:23:59,451 --> 00:24:00,830
How much do you want?

284
00:24:00,926 --> 00:24:02,594
Comrade General!

285
00:24:04,555 --> 00:24:06,148
For Comrade Stalin...

286
00:24:06,568 --> 00:24:08,435
For Him,
I do it for free!

287
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:10,038
Heheh..
you're going too far!

288
00:24:10,328 --> 00:24:13,027
Nobody works
for us for nothing!

289
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,415
How much do you earn?

290
00:24:15,415 --> 00:24:16,978
Please be seated..

291
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,600
800 rubles in the KGB club.

292
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,040
Ohhhh...not much!

293
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,790
Another 400 with overtime!

294
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:26,235
Which makes 1200...

295
00:24:26,235 --> 00:24:28,270
Well here you will make...

296
00:24:29,215 --> 00:24:30,780
hmmm.. -1600.

297
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,540
plus food

298
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,880
Is it a deal?

299
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,460
Yes, sir!

300
00:24:36,105 --> 00:24:37,737
One thing, though...

301
00:24:38,195 --> 00:24:40,300
Your wife, relatives, friends,

302
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,842
not a single person should
know that you work here!

303
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:46,916
You're smart enough to know that
there are enemies everywhere!

304
00:24:48,035 --> 00:24:49,597
I won't breathe a word!

305
00:24:49,597 --> 00:24:50,831
Even if tortured!

306
00:24:50,831 --> 00:24:52,295
Good boy!

307
00:24:54,285 --> 00:24:55,929
We celebrate to early present.

308
00:24:58,077 --> 00:25:00,201
The coupon is valid for one
food ration.

309
00:25:00,508 --> 00:25:02,290
Place it behind the Bolshoi Theatre

310
00:25:02,938 --> 00:25:08,068
Now go to the cashier and collect
your advance of 2,000 rubles!

311
00:25:10,003 --> 00:25:11,047
2,000!!?

312
00:25:13,046 --> 00:25:14,237
Not enough?!

313
00:25:14,417 --> 00:25:16,124
It's more than enough!!

314
00:25:17,477 --> 00:25:20,322
I enter the service
of the Proletariat!

315
00:25:34,422 --> 00:25:35,482
The room is sealed!

316
00:25:35,772 --> 00:25:37,372
Where are the child's belongings!?

317
00:25:37,372 --> 00:25:38,542
In the room.

318
00:25:38,542 --> 00:25:41,326
When they took the Gubelmans, by the way,
they confiscated everything.

319
00:25:41,657 --> 00:25:45,557
Clothes, letters,
an electric iron, fur coats!

320
00:25:45,557 --> 00:25:48,117
They've come
for the little Gubelman girl

321
00:25:48,117 --> 00:25:49,502
You see.. her mother was arrested!

322
00:25:49,502 --> 00:25:50,717
Arrested??

323
00:25:51,387 --> 00:25:53,932
They arrested Sonia
and sealed the room.

324
00:25:53,932 --> 00:25:55,842
Now it's the baby's turn....

325
00:25:56,212 --> 00:25:57,732
Where is she?!

326
00:25:58,037 --> 00:25:59,434
She's with Anastasia.

327
00:26:00,979 --> 00:26:02,381
- When was this?
-At two...

328
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,067
-And When did they come?
Early, early...

329
00:26:05,537 --> 00:26:07,673
except a bed and a bureau.

330
00:26:09,182 --> 00:26:11,362
No, and the cat!
Ladies, He has him!

331
00:26:12,407 --> 00:26:14,487
Are you going crazy?!
Come here, darling, come on..

332
00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:19,272
But the neighbor woman said if we
fill out an application, we can adopt her!

333
00:26:19,582 --> 00:26:21,787
A daughter of an enemy
of the people?!?

334
00:26:21,787 --> 00:26:23,202
I'd get sacked!

335
00:26:23,502 --> 00:26:25,552
Immediately!
Now Go!

336
00:26:28,592 --> 00:26:30,217
Here she is.

337
00:26:30,877 --> 00:26:33,372
How am I going to take her
without her things?

338
00:26:34,207 --> 00:26:36,427
Is it possible to adopt the child?

339
00:26:38,607 --> 00:26:40,067
Are you related to the girl?

340
00:26:43,027 --> 00:26:44,403
No ties, whatsoever!!

341
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:47,112
And we aren't going to file
for adoption!

342
00:26:54,747 --> 00:26:58,144
Looks like...
we'll have to break the seal!

343
00:26:58,302 --> 00:26:59,687
Where is the phone?

344
00:26:59,687 --> 00:27:00,857
Oh, please!

345
00:27:06,612 --> 00:27:08,904
Nastia, look at all this food!

346
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,470
It's from my boss!

347
00:27:10,612 --> 00:27:11,932
Just look at all this...!

348
00:27:12,112 --> 00:27:15,062
sturgeon, crab meat, caviar...!

349
00:27:16,047 --> 00:27:18,867
Look at this...
Nastia, look!

350
00:27:18,867 --> 00:27:21,618
Free of poisonous substances

351
00:27:22,539 --> 00:27:23,649
You see!?!

352
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,703
This is our wedding present!

353
00:27:28,015 --> 00:27:31,146
Just think...
Gubelman spies!

354
00:27:32,376 --> 00:27:33,909
Gubelmans are Gubelmans!

355
00:27:34,316 --> 00:27:35,363
Eat!

356
00:27:38,484 --> 00:27:40,317
I've always been suspicious of them.

357
00:27:40,667 --> 00:27:42,052
Working in foreign countries...

358
00:27:49,253 --> 00:27:50,972
Don't cry....

359
00:27:56,072 --> 00:27:57,779
We'll make our own babies..!

360
00:27:58,357 --> 00:28:00,977
Eat!

361
00:28:01,887 --> 00:28:03,352
Come on!

362
00:28:04,133 --> 00:28:07,086
Get in the car, it's getting late!

363
00:29:15,142 --> 00:29:16,192
What's that?

364
00:29:18,377 --> 00:29:19,459
First warning!

365
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:30,227
Is Voroshilov coming?

366
00:29:31,062 --> 00:29:32,527
What's it to you?

367
00:29:32,552 --> 00:29:33,632
What do you mean?

368
00:29:33,752 --> 00:29:34,817
He's Comrade Voroshilov!

369
00:29:34,967 --> 00:29:36,550
I have his pictures
all over my room!

370
00:29:37,712 --> 00:29:40,018
Do you know?
He's the first Red Officer!

371
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:41,994
I even dream about him..

372
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,534
Maybe yes,
maybe no..

373
00:29:45,192 --> 00:29:46,384
Don't worry about it!

374
00:29:46,942 --> 00:29:49,535
How can you not be excited
seeing all these people??

375
00:29:50,027 --> 00:29:51,044
You'll get used to it.

376
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,707
What's that you are poking
into the projector?

377
00:29:56,707 --> 00:29:58,077
Toothbrush

378
00:29:58,575 --> 00:29:59,762
Very convenient for cleaning.

379
00:30:00,046 --> 00:30:01,438
I always carry one with me.

380
00:30:03,706 --> 00:30:05,862
The old projectionist
never had anything like that!

381
00:30:08,526 --> 00:30:10,446
What happened to him?

382
00:30:11,551 --> 00:30:12,597
He died.

383
00:30:12,701 --> 00:30:15,466
The night you came,
the Minister of Cinema yelled at him

384
00:30:15,466 --> 00:30:16,611
So he had a heart attack!

385
00:30:16,611 --> 00:30:18,561
Ended up dead!

386
00:30:35,911 --> 00:30:37,931
What are they doing with that
vacuum cleaner?

387
00:30:39,151 --> 00:30:40,216
Testing the air.

388
00:30:40,466 --> 00:30:41,646
The air?

389
00:30:43,026 --> 00:30:45,015
In case someone wants
to poison him...

390
00:30:46,109 --> 00:30:47,842
But... Who?

391
00:30:49,074 --> 00:30:50,852
There are spies and subversives
everywhere.

392
00:30:51,414 --> 00:30:52,990
Even here ...
in the Kremlin?

393
00:30:55,051 --> 00:30:56,646
They might be even in the Kremlin...

394
00:31:03,226 --> 00:31:04,375
Are you Sanshin?
-Sir!

395
00:31:05,226 --> 00:31:06,523
Why didn't you report yourself?

396
00:31:07,851 --> 00:31:09,036
I.. wasn't told to.

397
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,621
Tomorrow report an arrival.
-Sir!

398
00:31:34,906 --> 00:31:36,099
Who was that?

399
00:31:37,781 --> 00:31:39,671
Deputy Chief of Special Sector

400
00:31:40,186 --> 00:31:41,981
Colonel Schelkasov

401
00:31:41,981 --> 00:31:43,530
Sperial Sector? What's that?

402
00:31:44,276 --> 00:31:46,023
You'll find out soon enough!

403
00:31:52,838 --> 00:31:53,947
Is everything is in order?

404
00:31:54,508 --> 00:31:55,583
Yes, Comrade General.

405
00:32:22,138 --> 00:32:24,573
You missed it, ****

406
00:32:25,183 --> 00:32:27,513
I didn't have time to check it all,
Comrade General.

407
00:32:27,823 --> 00:32:29,052
You didn't have time...

408
00:32:32,843 --> 00:32:35,314
Petrov! Take it for testing now

409
00:32:36,198 --> 00:32:37,316
I'll take care of it..

410
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,472
General Vlasik is not a dumb * !

411
00:32:41,344 --> 00:32:42,562
Take it to the lab..

412
00:32:58,865 --> 00:33:01,640
Still wet, straight from the lab
it's "tractor drivers". New print.

413
00:33:02,712 --> 00:33:04,460
Set these two "tractor drivers" here...

414
00:33:05,342 --> 00:33:08,299
Charlie Chaplin, Great Waltz, Circus.

415
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,248
Over there, put the American Western.

416
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:11,894
Get them ready!

417
00:33:14,955 --> 00:33:17,855
Comrade Minister, we've got 9 hours.
What should we start with?

418
00:33:22,936 --> 00:33:24,701
Rule 1 - No questions!

419
00:33:25,191 --> 00:33:27,440
You'll find out when
Comrade Stalin arrives!

420
00:33:28,222 --> 00:33:30,656
The minute I call you,
start looking, all right?

421
00:34:18,357 --> 00:34:21,302
Svetlana, come here,
my dear girl.

422
00:34:57,627 --> 00:34:58,732
There they were.

423
00:34:58,732 --> 00:35:00,629
The Heroes of our revolution.

424
00:35:01,177 --> 00:35:04,928
Just like ordinary people
going to a movie.

425
00:35:05,541 --> 00:35:06,869
Kalinin - The President

426
00:35:08,086 --> 00:35:10,336
Molotov - The Foreign Minister

427
00:35:11,205 --> 00:35:13,325
Kaganovich,
even Comrade Beria

428
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:16,419
The head of the KGB -
who everyone,

429
00:35:17,028 --> 00:35:20,205
even the other men in that room,
were so afrad of.

430
00:35:22,998 --> 00:35:24,279
And then...

431
00:35:31,288 --> 00:35:36,586
Comrade Stalin!
Comrade... Stalin!

432
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,532
Where is Comrade Voroshilov?

433
00:36:03,493 --> 00:36:05,993
-Sanshin!
-Put on The Great Waltz!

434
00:36:05,993 --> 00:36:07,194
The Great Waltz!

435
00:36:46,206 --> 00:36:47,301
So they started...

436
00:36:47,301 --> 00:36:48,473
Yes, comrade Voroshilov.

437
00:36:49,636 --> 00:36:50,749
What's on?

438
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,765
The Great Waltz,
Comrade Minister of Defense.

439
00:38:16,181 --> 00:38:18,229
-Sanshin?
-Sanshin, Come down here.

440
00:38:48,256 --> 00:38:49,063
Svetlana!

441
00:38:53,573 --> 00:38:54,854
Go to the car!

442
00:39:09,672 --> 00:39:11,703
This is an unfamiliar face to me..

443
00:39:12,127 --> 00:39:14,592
Comrade Stalin, this is
our new projectionist, Ivan Sanshin.

444
00:39:15,912 --> 00:39:17,324
Where is the old one?

445
00:39:17,732 --> 00:39:18,827
He got sick.

446
00:39:18,827 --> 00:39:20,110
Tuberculosis...

447
00:39:20,597 --> 00:39:21,847
Is this one healthy?

448
00:39:21,847 --> 00:39:22,870
This one is healthy.

449
00:39:29,762 --> 00:39:32,852
You projected well,
comrade Sanshin

450
00:39:38,427 --> 00:39:40,037
Listen, Joseph...

451
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:43,057
You know you asked me to look
into the reorganization of the

452
00:39:43,057 --> 00:39:44,127
Bug off!

453
00:40:36,254 --> 00:40:37,784
Join us!

454
00:40:38,954 --> 00:40:40,139
Don't be shy.

455
00:40:40,139 --> 00:40:41,187
Dig in.

456
00:40:42,114 --> 00:40:43,182
Is it ok?

457
00:40:44,489 --> 00:40:45,675
Yes, it's ok.

458
00:40:47,991 --> 00:40:49,249
Come on, shovel it in.

459
00:40:49,721 --> 00:40:52,157
Once it's opened,
it might be eaten.

460
00:40:52,831 --> 00:40:53,964
They'll never use it again!

461
00:40:54,606 --> 00:40:57,078
You've eaten all the brandy-filled
chocolates..!

462
00:40:57,776 --> 00:40:59,476
She likes the brandy chocolates, huh?

463
00:41:06,699 --> 00:41:08,777
How does it feel
sitting in the Master's chair?

464
00:41:08,961 --> 00:41:10,320
It's still warm, right?

465
00:41:15,496 --> 00:41:18,111
The Master was very angry
with the Minister of Defense!

466
00:41:18,611 --> 00:41:20,336
What does he have
against Voroshilov?

467
00:41:20,336 --> 00:41:21,564
The Japanese crushed us...

468
00:41:21,576 --> 00:41:23,896
... in Manchuria.
He won't forgive him for that.

469
00:41:25,443 --> 00:41:27,430
Comrades Officers!

470
00:41:55,148 --> 00:41:56,285
Who is that for?

471
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,898
For my wife.

472
00:41:58,144 --> 00:42:00,124
When they make you the
Head of Special Sector

473
00:42:00,124 --> 00:42:02,125
you can treat your wife
to candies!

474
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,149
You can stuff yourself with them.

475
00:42:08,431 --> 00:42:09,993
..but take them out? Never!

476
00:42:11,819 --> 00:42:12,851
I Got it.

477
00:42:22,035 --> 00:42:23,913
The Soviet people unanimously declare
...

478
00:42:24,326 --> 00:42:26,344
there is no limit to our indignation!

479
00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:30,102
We demand the right sentence
for the gang of traitors to socialism.

480
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:31,950
Throughout the country, people rallied

481
00:42:32,106 --> 00:42:33,665
in support of the purge

482
00:42:33,932 --> 00:42:36,227
after Comrade Beria discovered another

483
00:42:36,227 --> 00:42:38,942
counter-revolutionary plot
against the Master.

484
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:42,680
I can remember the huge demonstrations
at Red Square.

485
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,511
All of us chanting:
"Death to the traitors".

486
00:42:46,666 --> 00:42:51,866
50,000 high-ranking party members
confessed to being capitalist agents.

487
00:42:52,435 --> 00:42:55,841
All of them were either imprisoned,
or executed.

488
00:43:05,032 --> 00:43:06,355
I love watching feet...

489
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,430
even cows' feet!

490
00:43:10,665 --> 00:43:12,113
Just like in the village,
isn't it?

491
00:43:15,755 --> 00:43:18,550
"Mercenaries and saboteurs
have been condemned"

492
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:22,935
"by the Military Court of the USSR today,
to the firing squad!"

493
00:43:23,431 --> 00:43:25,486
Why do you take down
Voroshilov's picture?

494
00:43:25,701 --> 00:43:27,334
You don't like him anymore?

495
00:43:28,121 --> 00:43:30,199
Maybe he's an enemy of the people
as well, huh..

496
00:43:30,921 --> 00:43:32,144
What?

497
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,071
What did you say?

498
00:43:35,255 --> 00:43:36,797
I was just joking!

499
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:39,682
Who told you this?

500
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,226
Nobody told me!

501
00:43:41,465 --> 00:43:43,459
Who have you been talking to?
Nastia, tell me..

502
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,756
Who have you been talking to?

503
00:43:44,756 --> 00:43:47,296
-I haven't been talking to anyone!
-It was Morda, wasn't it!

504
00:43:47,296 --> 00:43:49,556
No, I haven't been talking to Morda.
It was a joke!

505
00:43:49,556 --> 00:43:51,851
Don't you know what can happen
when you make these kinds of jokes??!

506
00:43:51,851 --> 00:43:53,407
Don't YOU??!!?

507
00:43:59,232 --> 00:44:01,536
You stupid country fool!

508
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:04,226
You deserve a good beating
for this joke!!

509
00:44:05,251 --> 00:44:06,300
You stupid little-

510
00:44:07,621 --> 00:44:11,510
Hey! Hey!
Get out of there!

511
00:44:12,226 --> 00:44:13,861
Get out! Get out!

512
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,062
Orphanage Center KGB

513
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:40,851
I'm applying for the job
to help with the children.

514
00:44:40,965 --> 00:44:41,920
Go ahead.

515
00:44:42,459 --> 00:44:43,737
Thank you.

516
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,180
You'll register with the
Staff Department, tomorrow.

517
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,210
Now straight to the showers!

518
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:07,748
We need all the hands we can get.

519
00:45:08,696 --> 00:45:10,177
The kids must be sent out!

520
00:45:10,351 --> 00:45:12,332
and they haven't been washed
in three days!!

521
00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:14,545
And all of them are still in shock!!

522
00:45:14,589 --> 00:45:17,310
and most of them don't even understand
that their parents were arrested...

523
00:45:17,406 --> 00:45:18,975
for being traitors to the motherland!

524
00:45:20,182 --> 00:45:21,522
Who dressed you so smart?

525
00:45:22,576 --> 00:45:23,468
I did...

526
00:45:24,941 --> 00:45:26,876
What a good girl you are.
What's your name?

527
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:29,635
I want my mommy..

528
00:45:30,049 --> 00:45:31,733
Come, let's go
play with the kids!

529
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:34,678
I'm Marsha!

530
00:45:35,737 --> 00:45:38,449
- Now Peter, come and hold her hand!
-I'm not Peter. I'm Volva!

531
00:45:38,638 --> 00:45:39,022
Children!

532
00:45:39,529 --> 00:45:40,961
Join hands and form a circle!

533
00:45:41,616 --> 00:45:42,458
Come quickly!

534
00:45:44,816 --> 00:45:46,426
Join hands and form a circle!

535
00:45:46,894 --> 00:45:48,233
Come quickly!

536
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:51,007
Now children, I want--

537
00:45:51,405 --> 00:45:53,409
Please meet a special boy!

538
00:45:53,409 --> 00:45:56,209
His name is Pavlik.

539
00:45:56,655 --> 00:45:59,383
Like that of Pavlik Morozov!

540
00:46:02,605 --> 00:46:04,109
He's a hero!

541
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:06,079
And do you know why?

542
00:46:06,735 --> 00:46:10,164
His mother and father turned out to be
enemies of the people,

543
00:46:10,656 --> 00:46:12,228
and he denounced them!

544
00:46:13,669 --> 00:46:16,564
So let's dance around our hero!

545
00:46:17,035 --> 00:46:23,888
1,2,3!
Our country is a land of beauty,

546
00:46:24,476 --> 00:46:28,484
Our country is a land that's free...

547
00:46:29,152 --> 00:46:32,972
Many are bloodhounds in their cities

548
00:46:32,972 --> 00:46:35,267
All these kids must be sent
to Pokrov in two hours!

549
00:46:35,507 --> 00:46:37,908
The home there is
large enough for all of them.

550
00:46:38,512 --> 00:46:39,628
Have you got kids?

551
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:54,554
Are you looking for someone?

552
00:46:55,328 --> 00:46:56,719
No! Just looking..

553
00:46:57,628 --> 00:46:59,251
Have you been to Pokrov?

554
00:46:59,313 --> 00:47:00,576
It's a big orphanage there..

555
00:47:00,774 --> 00:47:02,354
nice and clean, with good food too.

556
00:47:11,289 --> 00:47:13,150
I want my mommy!

557
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,810
Did you meet a little girl
by the name of Katya?

558
00:47:33,975 --> 00:47:37,250
She has a red bow in her hair.
-No?

559
00:47:53,932 --> 00:47:55,512
So little, but stubborn!

560
00:47:55,512 --> 00:47:56,989
probably took after her parents!

561
00:47:57,287 --> 00:47:59,231
Do not be afraid!
You'll get your things back!

562
00:47:59,537 --> 00:48:02,135
Prick her with something!
Here use this pin!

563
00:48:12,088 --> 00:48:14,423
Have you seen this nice
girl called Katya?

564
00:48:14,423 --> 00:48:15,858
She has a red bow?

565
00:48:16,243 --> 00:48:17,337
Aunt Anastasia!

566
00:48:17,713 --> 00:48:18,343
Katya!

567
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:21,933
I can not believe
I found you! Look at you!

568
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:24,730
We'll wash you, and dry you
and I'll ask nice lady

569
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:26,010
if we can take you home.

570
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:29,222
I was right!

571
00:48:29,705 --> 00:48:31,437
Please forgive me
comrade Agorzova!

572
00:48:31,573 --> 00:48:33,556
I lied. I came here
to see the girl!

573
00:48:33,978 --> 00:48:36,488
I knew it!
I sensed it.

574
00:48:39,758 --> 00:48:40,731
Is she your relative?

575
00:48:40,768 --> 00:48:42,522
No, she's one of my neighbors,
the Gubelmans.

576
00:48:42,522 --> 00:48:43,902
She's little Gubelman!

577
00:48:43,902 --> 00:48:45,691
I recognized her straight away!
Katya Gubelman!

578
00:48:45,976 --> 00:48:46,714
Tania!

579
00:48:46,714 --> 00:48:47,500
No!

580
00:48:48,117 --> 00:48:53,063
-Finish what she has done!
-You can not take Katya from me!

581
00:48:56,802 --> 00:48:59,224
You're coming with me!

582
00:49:26,177 --> 00:49:28,267
It's not enough that you are
taking your own, you idiot!

583
00:49:28,292 --> 00:49:29,537
you want to put
me in with you !?

584
00:49:29,934 --> 00:49:32,590
I could end up in a
labor camp because of you!

585
00:49:33,334 --> 00:49:36,461
The child cannot be responsible
for her parents..

586
00:49:36,604 --> 00:49:38,159
Comrade Stalin said...

587
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:40,471
Comrade Stalin said, but
Comrade Beria ordered!

588
00:49:40,525 --> 00:49:41,681
Got it?!

589
00:49:43,275 --> 00:49:45,819
The KGB has already a file on her,
do you understand!!?

590
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,746
She's MFTM!

591
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:54,161
Member of the Family
of the Traitors of the Motherland.

592
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:07,435
All these kids without exception are...
loaded in...

593
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:09,423
In where?

594
00:50:09,722 --> 00:50:11,204
Into the meat grinder.

595
00:50:22,932 --> 00:50:25,131
Can I just say goodbye to her?

596
00:50:25,458 --> 00:50:26,318
No, you can't!

597
00:50:26,696 --> 00:50:28,439
I won't let you torture
the poor child!

598
00:50:28,867 --> 00:50:31,574
Think of her, every time her little heart
breaks into pieces!

599
00:50:35,631 --> 00:50:36,401
Get out of here!

600
00:50:53,149 --> 00:50:56,766
Pokrov... it's the town
south of Moscow, no?

601
00:50:57,745 --> 00:50:58,495
Yes.

602
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:03,102
Thank you very much
Comrade Agorzova!

603
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:05,985
Hey!

604
00:51:16,435 --> 00:51:18,321
Whatever happens, remember...

605
00:51:19,739 --> 00:51:21,379
I don't know your name.

606
00:51:21,379 --> 00:51:23,364
I haven't
seen your passport.

607
00:51:24,676 --> 00:51:26,292
So don't hold anything
against me..

608
00:52:12,555 --> 00:52:14,845
It is the second time
it's broken!

609
00:52:14,845 --> 00:52:17,740
This Soviet portable projector
is a new model.

610
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:20,480
The projectionist
hasn't mastered it yet.

611
00:52:21,005 --> 00:52:22,440
It's not that, comrade minister.

612
00:52:22,455 --> 00:52:23,659
I know this machine!

613
00:52:23,895 --> 00:52:24,453
How can you?

614
00:52:24,591 --> 00:52:25,753
It is the latest design.

615
00:52:26,104 --> 00:52:27,167
This comrade Minister

616
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:28,328
is an exact copy

617
00:52:28,731 --> 00:52:29,961
of the German Bauer

618
00:52:30,083 --> 00:52:31,004
the 1925 model

619
00:52:31,145 --> 00:52:32,847
I worked with one just like
it in the army.

620
00:52:33,596 --> 00:52:34,294
A copy of what?

621
00:52:34,857 --> 00:52:36,119
Of the Bauer, Comrade Stalin!

622
00:52:36,602 --> 00:52:37,447
German.

623
00:52:37,447 --> 00:52:38,899
Except that the German model has

624
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:40,989
a steel spring that holds
the frame of this...

625
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:45,245
spring is made of...
I don't know what...

626
00:52:50,097 --> 00:52:53,163
help tighten the claw
tears the film

627
00:52:53,788 --> 00:52:54,872
Show me the spring.

628
00:53:00,662 --> 00:53:03,485
It is not even a spring,
it's a little wire!

629
00:53:06,963 --> 00:53:08,589
We have a  whole
Minister of Cinema

630
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,336
but we have no little spring!

631
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:14,110
We can't even copy
the Germans properly!

632
00:53:14,703 --> 00:53:16,373
Comrade Boreshilkov, you promised

633
00:53:16,373 --> 00:53:19,010
we'd have a patent on portable projectors
of Soviet design.

634
00:53:19,753 --> 00:53:21,118
And it turns out just to be
a copy!

635
00:53:22,379 --> 00:53:23,596
And a bad one at that!

636
00:53:23,763 --> 00:53:25,986
We will correct our mistake,
Comrade Stalin!

637
00:53:28,335 --> 00:53:29,634
Isn't it a little late?

638
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:43,849
You should be ashamed.

639
00:53:46,735 --> 00:53:47,283
And look!

640
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:51,133
We are sitting here watching films
in comfort,

641
00:53:51,133 --> 00:53:53,108
drinking mineral water, eating fruit,

642
00:53:53,768 --> 00:53:55,636
but in a remote corner of Siberia,

643
00:53:55,909 --> 00:53:57,306
where winter lasts eight months,

644
00:53:57,886 --> 00:53:59,851
a simple man, a farmer

645
00:54:00,585 --> 00:54:02,158
wonders what he can do.

646
00:54:03,919 --> 00:54:05,157
He could have seen a movie

647
00:54:05,312 --> 00:54:06,716
of the Red Square parade

648
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:08,306
or a comedy to relax,

649
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:10,846
But there is no movie for him.

650
00:54:16,431 --> 00:54:17,834
Why?

651
00:54:19,425 --> 00:54:22,001
Because Comrade Bolshakov
failed in his duty.

652
00:54:23,626 --> 00:54:25,512
And didn't provide
a proper little spring.

653
00:54:28,771 --> 00:54:30,582
We may not have enough
of everything

654
00:54:31,053 --> 00:54:33,600
but as for steel...
we have plenty!

655
00:54:37,368 --> 00:54:38,974
Am I right,
Comrade Kaganovich?

656
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:42,815
We are up to here in steel,
Comrade Stalin!

657
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:48,365
Comrade--

658
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:50,004
Sanshin, Comrade Sanshin.

659
00:54:52,437 --> 00:54:53,506
Comrade Sanshin,

660
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,445
Can you repair it?

661
00:54:57,304 --> 00:54:58,823
I'll try my best,
comrade Stalin!

662
00:55:00,974 --> 00:55:02,374
Then we will have a tea break.

663
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,743
Oh, have tea with lemon!

664
00:55:42,282 --> 00:55:43,594
Look Sanshin.. don't be nervous.

665
00:55:44,183 --> 00:55:45,692
Don't worry, Comrade Minister!

666
00:55:49,818 --> 00:55:50,658
Comrade Kalinin?

667
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:53,574
Kalinin, join us!

668
00:55:59,450 --> 00:56:01,276
Don't nap on the job, old man!

669
00:56:05,525 --> 00:56:06,503
I'm ready, Comrade Stalin!

670
00:56:07,411 --> 00:56:10,204
And Comrade Bolshakov thinks you're
too inexperienced!

671
00:56:11,224 --> 00:56:13,298
We haven't even had time
to drink our tea...

672
00:56:13,555 --> 00:56:15,148
and you've already
fixed the problem.

673
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:20,061
Then have some tea with us,
Comrade Sanshin!

674
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,494
No thank you,
comrade Stalin..

675
00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:27,751
Good tea is like a kiss
from a beautiful woman...

676
00:56:28,096 --> 00:56:28,909
strong and sweet!

677
00:56:49,165 --> 00:56:50,900
Why are your hands shaking?

678
00:56:51,371 --> 00:56:52,884
Did you raid a henhouse?

679
00:56:53,061 --> 00:56:56,882
No. I didn't raid
a henhouse, Comrade Stalin.

680
00:56:57,178 --> 00:56:58,577
My hands are shaking because

681
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,729
it's the first time
that I've seen you this close!

682
00:57:01,265 --> 00:57:02,293
So what?

683
00:57:02,990 --> 00:57:04,035
It's the first time

684
00:57:04,035 --> 00:57:05,100
I have seen you this close

685
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:06,910
but my hands aren't shaking!

686
00:57:15,762 --> 00:57:17,287
In your opinion, comrade Sanshin

687
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:20,326
Is this projector any better
than the German original?

688
00:57:21,102 --> 00:57:23,173
It's a good projector, Comrade Stalin!

689
00:57:23,173 --> 00:57:24,333
Very good.

690
00:57:24,333 --> 00:57:26,261
But the spring should be improved, eh?

691
00:57:33,513 --> 00:57:35,348
Don't worry!
We're all friends here!

692
00:57:38,023 --> 00:57:42,196
It would be better if it were made of steel.

693
00:57:47,887 --> 00:57:48,592
Bolshakov!

694
00:57:50,103 --> 00:57:50,959
Did you hear that?

695
00:57:51,959 --> 00:57:54,210
Follow the recommendations of this expert.

696
00:58:08,887 --> 00:58:11,724
December 21, 1940

697
00:58:12,414 --> 00:58:13,814
The Master's Birthday

698
00:58:14,989 --> 00:58:17,542
The capitalist countries were
destroying each other.

699
00:58:18,635 --> 00:58:20,387
Poland and France had fallen.

700
00:58:21,381 --> 00:58:22,929
But we were safe.

701
00:58:23,346 --> 00:58:27,446
Comrade Stalin had signed a
nonaggression pact with Hitler.

702
00:58:27,698 --> 00:58:31,348
Our nation was at peace
and my life was perfect.

703
00:58:32,223 --> 00:58:36,037
I had been taken into the
"Inner Circle".

704
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:46,668
Great news, comrades!

705
00:58:47,689 --> 00:58:49,762
We're moving to the
Gubelmans' room!

706
00:58:50,199 --> 00:58:51,771
It's your lucky day, Fedosia!

707
00:58:52,473 --> 00:58:54,005
Now you can live by yourself,

708
00:58:54,598 --> 00:58:56,362
just like before the revolution!

709
00:58:56,843 --> 00:58:58,018
I'm sure they will send

710
00:58:58,018 --> 00:58:59,916
some asshole in your place.

711
00:59:05,562 --> 00:59:06,562
"Do not open"

712
00:59:11,304 --> 00:59:12,617
So, you like it?

713
00:59:14,565 --> 00:59:16,019
Yes, I like it very much.

714
00:59:18,104 --> 00:59:19,182
Except for that on the wall.

715
00:59:22,349 --> 00:59:26,377
Here.. We can get new wallpaper
in the spring.

716
00:59:26,824 --> 00:59:28,671
And for now, we put something
in front of it.

717
00:59:31,792 --> 00:59:34,938
Ivan, do you have permission
to move?

718
00:59:37,605 --> 00:59:38,982
Do you want to know who gave us this room?

719
00:59:41,724 --> 00:59:44,663
Yeah, I think it's time you knew,
but Only You.

720
00:59:45,364 --> 00:59:47,999
You must keep it a secret.
Not one word - not to anyone, never!

721
00:59:56,170 --> 00:59:56,858
Nastia!

722
01:00:01,807 --> 01:00:02,713
I work with Comrade Stalin!

723
01:00:09,712 --> 01:00:11,057
No! Where?

724
01:00:11,475 --> 01:00:12,005
In the Kremlin!

725
01:00:12,972 --> 01:00:13,768
With Comrade Stalin!

726
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:15,628
It's been five months
already now!

727
01:00:15,998 --> 01:00:19,149
He loves movies, so
I show him movies.

728
01:00:19,931 --> 01:00:21,943
Both in the Kremlin and at
his country residence!

729
01:00:22,772 --> 01:00:23,912
And for his kids too!

730
01:00:27,717 --> 01:00:29,357
When I don't come home at night

731
01:00:30,952 --> 01:00:32,291
It's because I'm there!

732
01:00:32,788 --> 01:00:33,644
At their house.

733
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:35,556
You see, Anastasia?

734
01:00:37,536 --> 01:00:40,346
Your husband is an
officer of the KGB!

735
01:00:42,551 --> 01:00:43,159
The uniform is made to order

736
01:00:43,710 --> 01:00:45,347
but I can only wear it on
special occasions.

737
01:00:47,468 --> 01:00:48,967
Otherwise, simple civilian clothes.

738
01:00:57,060 --> 01:00:59,235
My God! A spring mattress!

739
01:00:59,794 --> 01:01:01,025
And it doesn't creak!

740
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:02,653
Come here, Nastia!

741
01:01:07,052 --> 01:01:10,309
My God! We're so lucky!

742
01:01:11,121 --> 01:01:12,588
To be honored like this!

743
01:01:13,258 --> 01:01:14,769
There's only a handful of us

744
01:01:15,006 --> 01:01:17,294
that can see Him
that close!

745
01:01:18,995 --> 01:01:20,668
I saw him already like this.

746
01:01:20,998 --> 01:01:21,880
Face to face!

747
01:01:22,121 --> 01:01:22,695
Twice!

748
01:01:28,651 --> 01:01:30,695
Do you think he's kind?

749
01:01:31,259 --> 01:01:34,251
There's probably no one kinder
in the whole world!!

750
01:01:43,669 --> 01:01:45,706
Let's write him a letter about Katya.

751
01:01:46,342 --> 01:01:47,798
Katya, What Katya?

752
01:01:48,558 --> 01:01:49,554
Gubelman.

753
01:01:49,841 --> 01:01:52,238
Ah, there you go again
with Gubelmans...

754
01:01:52,851 --> 01:01:55,441
Don't you understand?
They're enemies of the people!

755
01:02:02,569 --> 01:02:03,209
Ivan?

756
01:02:06,879 --> 01:02:08,466
I'm dying to have a child..

757
01:02:12,869 --> 01:02:14,119
Nothing's happening with us.

758
01:02:15,142 --> 01:02:16,970
It was that old witch
behind the wardrobe..

759
01:02:18,466 --> 01:02:19,228
Made me shy.

760
01:02:20,013 --> 01:02:21,226
Now it will be different!

761
01:02:24,832 --> 01:02:25,785
I'll just write the letter.

762
01:02:26,137 --> 01:02:27,580
and you can give it to him
when you have time!

763
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:30,933
It is forbidden to pass letters to him!

764
01:02:31,165 --> 01:02:32,713
And he really shouldn't be disturbed.

765
01:02:33,045 --> 01:02:34,145
If you had any idea

766
01:02:34,145 --> 01:02:36,350
how much he has to worry about.
There are enemies everywhere...

767
01:02:36,350 --> 01:02:40,310
Internal, external, imperialists,
fascists, Japanese...

768
01:02:40,310 --> 01:02:41,774
Totkistas, all lurking about!

769
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:45,663
And I'm going to bother him about
a daughter of an enemy of the people!?

770
01:02:50,181 --> 01:02:51,194
If it weren't for these Gubelman types...

771
01:02:53,223 --> 01:02:55,490
We would have had communism long ago.

772
01:02:58,998 --> 01:03:00,961
Let go of me!

773
01:03:13,674 --> 01:03:18,784
With an asshole like you for a husband,
I am doomed to this hellhole till I die

774
01:03:55,469 --> 01:03:59,653
Orphanage. 23
Pokrov

775
01:05:23,845 --> 01:05:30,106
Aunt Anastasia!
Aunt Anastasia!

776
01:05:30,249 --> 01:05:32,244
Katya!

777
01:06:01,434 --> 01:06:04,043
I want to show you something!

778
01:06:11,945 --> 01:06:13,329
Here! Over here.

779
01:06:18,815 --> 01:06:21,717
You've grown since Easter,
but there's nothing left of you!

780
01:06:25,091 --> 01:06:26,480
Do you recognize my bow?

781
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,268
Vera tryed to steal it twice!

782
01:06:29,004 --> 01:06:30,394
She had to clean corridors..

783
01:06:31,186 --> 01:06:32,796
after lunch as punishment!

784
01:06:33,639 --> 01:06:35,101
Just wait till you go to school.

785
01:06:35,585 --> 01:06:36,381
You'll grow hair!

786
01:06:37,177 --> 01:06:39,098
We'll put a bow in your braid.

787
01:06:39,268 --> 01:06:40,218
and you will be beautiful!

788
01:06:40,798 --> 01:06:43,449
Peter Lebersen is leaving today.

789
01:06:44,791 --> 01:06:46,788
His uncle is going to
take him home with him.

790
01:06:49,674 --> 01:06:51,201
When are you going to take me?

791
01:06:57,456 --> 01:06:59,156
Your mother and father will come
take you.

792
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,650
You must study hard and wait.

793
01:07:05,785 --> 01:07:07,958
I don't want any of the
arrested ones back!

794
01:07:10,115 --> 01:07:11,871
Don't talk like that.
You have good parents!

795
01:07:12,651 --> 01:07:14,695
No!! They are enemies of the people!

796
01:07:14,919 --> 01:07:16,258
They wanted to kill Stalin.

797
01:07:16,395 --> 01:07:17,393
They should be shot!

798
01:07:23,291 --> 01:07:24,281
It's a sin to talk like that!

799
01:07:24,281 --> 01:07:25,381
You should be ashamed!

800
01:07:25,411 --> 01:07:26,459
Not at all! Look!!

801
01:07:26,613 --> 01:07:27,873
Peter's parents were shot

802
01:07:27,873 --> 01:07:29,810
and now his uncle takes him home.

803
01:07:30,204 --> 01:07:32,769
Take me home.
I can't stay here any longer!

804
01:07:33,430 --> 01:07:36,082
Vera pinches me and she put a
frog in my bed yesterday.

805
01:07:39,498 --> 01:07:42,605
They used to come see Vera,
but nobody comes anymore.

806
01:07:43,117 --> 01:07:45,973
They've forgotten her!
One day you will forget me!

807
01:07:48,175 --> 01:07:50,170
Katya, I will never forget you!

808
01:07:50,829 --> 01:07:52,278
You're lying!
You're lying!

809
01:07:57,848 --> 01:08:01,417
Katya, I love you like my own child!

810
01:08:01,693 --> 01:08:04,212
Love me, Aunt Anastasia, please love me!

811
01:08:12,186 --> 01:08:14,631
Be my mother!

812
01:09:08,211 --> 01:09:10,414
Comrade Sanshin?
-Yeah!

813
01:09:10,726 --> 01:09:11,677
Follow me.

814
01:09:29,522 --> 01:09:30,489
Follow me.

815
01:09:36,706 --> 01:09:37,292
Where are we going?

816
01:09:38,154 --> 01:09:38,977
We're almost there.

817
01:10:06,019 --> 01:10:08,221
Didn't expect to see a familiar face,
did you?

818
01:10:09,188 --> 01:10:09,718
Sir!

819
01:10:10,468 --> 01:10:12,188
Be seated Sanshin, be seated.

820
01:10:13,248 --> 01:10:17,443
Let's have a nice talk with you
in comfort.

821
01:10:17,928 --> 01:10:19,222
Fyodor, bring us some tea.

822
01:10:23,303 --> 01:10:25,903
So you've been working for us
for three years now.

823
01:10:26,478 --> 01:10:28,458
Two years actually.

824
01:10:31,057 --> 01:10:33,325
You puzzle me, Ivan.
You're not a bad guy.

825
01:10:34,235 --> 01:10:35,515
Two years in the KGB ranks.

826
01:10:37,512 --> 01:10:42,047
Yet, um.. No outward
sign of patriotism.

827
01:10:43,192 --> 01:10:46,056
or political awareness.
or petulance.

828
01:10:47,495 --> 01:10:49,194
I don't understand, Comrade Colonel.

829
01:10:49,570 --> 01:10:52,130
Now in two years, you didn't
bring us a single report!

830
01:10:52,952 --> 01:10:55,140
denouncing some.. suspicious persons..

831
01:10:56,074 --> 01:10:58,146
or requesting an investigation.

832
01:10:58,723 --> 01:11:00,878
Comrade Colonel,
just look at the people I work with!

833
01:11:01,859 --> 01:11:03,747
We've all been screened and
tested a thousands times.

834
01:11:03,953 --> 01:11:05,703
Even the janitors have
a rank in the security course.

835
01:11:05,703 --> 01:11:07,288
-Who's talking about janitors?

836
01:11:07,288 --> 01:11:09,418
If I had seen anything suspicious,
I would have reported it immediately!

837
01:11:09,519 --> 01:11:12,000
I'm not talking about janitors!

838
01:11:23,474 --> 01:11:25,584
Now confidential, Sanshin...

839
01:11:27,503 --> 01:11:31,653
We've got information that an attempt
on Comrade Stalin's life is being plotted.

840
01:11:33,178 --> 01:11:34,678
The web involves the top brass.

841
01:11:35,128 --> 01:11:38,217
I can't give you their names,
but the potential assassin

842
01:11:39,114 --> 01:11:40,093
has free access to the Kremlin.

843
01:11:42,583 --> 01:11:43,629
Do you understand?

844
01:11:47,147 --> 01:11:48,483
This isn't the first conspiracy.

845
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:52,928
If it weren't for Comrade Beria,

846
01:11:54,517 --> 01:11:56,902
The Master would have been...

847
01:11:59,183 --> 01:11:59,820
... you know!

848
01:12:03,611 --> 01:12:04,299
Now you can go.

849
01:12:11,369 --> 01:12:12,339
By the way...

850
01:12:12,979 --> 01:12:19,414
Is it you.. or your wife...

851
01:12:19,414 --> 01:12:21,281
who is related to this man..

852
01:12:24,354 --> 01:12:26,505
Gubelman, arrested in 1939?

853
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:27,922
Related??

854
01:12:29,315 --> 01:12:31,765
What are you saying?
A neighbor by this name...

855
01:12:31,765 --> 01:12:35,759
Was arrested and we moved into his room
to improve our living conditions..

856
01:12:36,254 --> 01:12:39,689
I've got information that
your wife goes to Pokrov...

857
01:12:39,689 --> 01:12:41,573
to the orphanage to see

858
01:12:42,092 --> 01:12:43,942
Katya Gubelman, 6 years of age.

859
01:12:45,615 --> 01:12:46,682
As your wife's statement..

860
01:12:47,172 --> 01:12:48,609
She calls herself the girl's aunt!

861
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:53,892
Is that her signature?

862
01:13:05,902 --> 01:13:07,276
Damn it!

863
01:13:07,792 --> 01:13:10,191
I forbid her! But she keeps whining

864
01:13:10,191 --> 01:13:12,109
that the child is not guilty!

865
01:13:14,248 --> 01:13:14,914
That's it!

866
01:13:16,743 --> 01:13:17,725
Tomorrow I dump her!

867
01:13:20,102 --> 01:13:22,518
Don't break up the family
to hastilous action.

868
01:13:23,951 --> 01:13:25,724
But it needs to be reprimanded.

869
01:13:27,288 --> 01:13:29,563
Fortunately, the report
landed on my desk.

870
01:13:30,944 --> 01:13:32,735
So, I'm not going to show
it to anyone.

871
01:13:33,779 --> 01:13:36,232
But you have to do something

872
01:13:36,401 --> 01:13:37,767
to justify my trust.

873
01:13:40,591 --> 01:13:43,138
Work hard, Sanshin.
Work hard.

874
01:13:46,852 --> 01:13:47,630
Work hard.

875
01:13:51,622 --> 01:13:52,697
No more!

876
01:13:53,915 --> 01:13:57,133
No! I won't give her up for anything!

877
01:13:57,603 --> 01:13:58,628
Quiet, quiet!

878
01:14:05,099 --> 01:14:06,942
She is my daughter!
-Are you crazy?!!

879
01:14:13,249 --> 01:14:14,713
You better stop.

880
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:21,324
I'm not as good
wife to you.

881
01:14:30,956 --> 01:14:32,459
What are you doing?

882
01:14:33,956 --> 01:14:35,759
What are you doing?

883
01:14:39,109 --> 01:14:40,406
Why have you done this Anastasia?!

884
01:14:41,495 --> 01:14:42,851
They can arrest us
at any time now!

885
01:14:43,553 --> 01:14:44,336
What for?

886
01:14:44,618 --> 01:14:47,240
For being a relative of a traitor
to the motherland.

887
01:14:47,308 --> 01:14:48,792
You wrote it yourself.
I saw it! You!

888
01:14:49,342 --> 01:14:50,623
Stating that you're her relative!

889
01:14:51,742 --> 01:14:53,663
They wouldn't have let me
see her if I didn't.

890
01:14:55,192 --> 01:14:56,549
How long have you been
seeing her??

891
01:14:58,626 --> 01:15:00,294
-How Long?
-Two years.

892
01:15:12,572 --> 01:15:14,159
Don't you care anything about me?

893
01:15:17,607 --> 01:15:18,596
I'm working in the Kremlin,
and now

894
01:15:18,858 --> 01:15:23,168
they list me as a relative
of these Gubelmans.

895
01:15:26,016 --> 01:15:28,433
They can do anything with me now.

896
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:31,649
But you said Comrade Stalin
loves you.

897
01:15:31,929 --> 01:15:33,369
Stalin has nothing to do with it.

898
01:15:33,768 --> 01:15:35,305
They even put Molotov's wife
in prison.

899
01:15:35,566 --> 01:15:36,786
and you're talking about me???

900
01:15:38,426 --> 01:15:40,012
They won't even tell him what
happened to me!

901
01:15:40,966 --> 01:15:43,150
They'll just say I got sick
and that will be the end of it.

902
01:15:44,011 --> 01:15:45,988
got sick with tuberculosis.

903
01:15:48,044 --> 01:15:48,642
Anyone at home?

904
01:16:00,464 --> 01:16:01,309
Don't you ever knock?

905
01:16:02,677 --> 01:16:03,383
I did.

906
01:16:04,068 --> 01:16:05,646
But there was no answer,
comrade Sanshin.

907
01:16:10,091 --> 01:16:11,181
Telephone for you.

908
01:16:25,094 --> 01:16:28,031
I suppose they couldn't wait.
I knocked, but you didn't answer!

909
01:16:42,114 --> 01:16:43,055
You're going to live in there?

910
01:16:45,939 --> 01:16:47,592
She calls me Mother.

911
01:16:49,417 --> 01:16:51,178
And I promised I wouldn't abandon her.

912
01:16:53,563 --> 01:16:54,723
Who do you love better?

913
01:16:57,337 --> 01:16:58,262
Me or Katya?

914
01:17:00,614 --> 01:17:01,878
Who do you love better?

915
01:17:03,594 --> 01:17:05,233
Me or Comrade Stalin?

916
01:17:06,323 --> 01:17:07,670
Comrade Stalin, of course!

917
01:17:11,555 --> 01:17:12,783
And I love you!

918
01:17:14,315 --> 01:17:15,825
Most of all in the world!

919
01:17:33,802 --> 01:17:36,427
On 22 June 1941

920
01:17:36,973 --> 01:17:38,481
Hitler betrayed the Master,

921
01:17:39,203 --> 01:17:41,419
launching Blitzkrieg across our border.

922
01:17:42,481 --> 01:17:43,849
Russia was in flames,

923
01:17:44,725 --> 01:17:46,940
Our invincible troops,
destroyed.

924
01:17:52,163 --> 01:17:54,338
Comrade Stalin sat alone watching

925
01:17:54,338 --> 01:17:56,595
the captured fascist news reels.

926
01:18:25,807 --> 01:18:28,862
We all waited to
learn how he would save us.

927
01:18:40,023 --> 01:18:40,892
Nine weeks later

928
01:18:41,643 --> 01:18:44,404
The Nazi tanks were
7 mi. From the Kremlin.

929
01:18:45,761 --> 01:18:48,835
The Master ordered the government
to evacuate Moscow.

930
01:18:51,733 --> 01:18:52,391
Where are we going?

931
01:18:53,823 --> 01:18:54,665
To Kuibyshev.

932
01:18:55,288 --> 01:18:56,803
The whole government's
moving to the Urals.

933
01:18:57,303 --> 01:18:59,348
It's the first train
with Political Bureau members.

934
01:18:59,383 --> 01:19:00,810
I have to start up a screening

935
01:19:01,031 --> 01:19:02,668
and they've hired you
as a waitress!

936
01:19:03,186 --> 01:19:06,181
Somebody has to serve tea to the top brass,
and they're short of hands.

937
01:19:06,181 --> 01:19:07,620
I will explain it all to you on the train.

938
01:20:48,197 --> 01:20:50,637
Have you got a decent bra?
This one shows through the blouse.

939
01:20:51,024 --> 01:20:52,195
I have nothing clean.

940
01:20:52,820 --> 01:20:54,818
It's ok, it's ok, we will cover
it up with the apron.

941
01:20:57,410 --> 01:21:00,483
I don't know, Ivan!
I'm so clumsy..

942
01:21:00,588 --> 01:21:01,975
I spill tea in our own house.

943
01:21:02,575 --> 01:21:06,120
Here.. Look at how it's shaking.
-Just don't fill the glasses to the top.

944
01:21:06,535 --> 01:21:09,535
Their carriages don't shake much,
they're so heavily armoured.

945
01:21:09,535 --> 01:21:10,896
They just glide.

946
01:21:12,079 --> 01:21:13,893
You'll be serving the
most important people.

947
01:21:14,076 --> 01:21:15,481
Remember, no questions.

948
01:21:18,327 --> 01:21:20,940
So carriages 14 and 15...

949
01:21:21,847 --> 01:21:23,612
Sanshin, Ivan and Anastasia, right?

950
01:21:25,078 --> 01:21:26,934
So you go to carriage 18

951
01:21:27,183 --> 01:21:31,315
And you'll....  -11.
Carriage 11.

952
01:21:33,004 --> 01:21:36,418
Well go to carriage 11.
Comrade Lieutenant will accompany you.

953
01:22:18,314 --> 01:22:19,563
Welcome.

954
01:22:32,703 --> 01:22:33,633
Take this.

955
01:22:45,022 --> 01:22:45,855
Come in.

956
01:22:52,293 --> 01:22:53,055
Good evening.

957
01:23:02,089 --> 01:23:03,402
For fizzy water...

958
01:23:15,303 --> 01:23:16,347
May I go?

959
01:23:19,957 --> 01:23:21,020
What's your name?

960
01:23:22,081 --> 01:23:22,855
Anastasia.

961
01:23:23,931 --> 01:23:25,347
Just like the czar's daughter..

962
01:23:26,816 --> 01:23:28,069
What a beauty she was.

963
01:23:34,718 --> 01:23:36,014
And you're no worse.

964
01:23:47,809 --> 01:23:50,049
Have you ever tasted
roast sturgeon with lemon?

965
01:23:52,283 --> 01:23:54,231
Just taste it and
you'll smack your lips!

966
01:23:59,673 --> 01:24:00,517
A little salt...

967
01:24:05,528 --> 01:24:06,901
That's it.

968
01:24:13,454 --> 01:24:14,512
Do you drink?

969
01:24:17,166 --> 01:24:17,995
Sometimes.

970
01:24:19,526 --> 01:24:21,946
There are two things you can
not trade even for gold.

971
01:24:23,147 --> 01:24:25,315
Love and health.

972
01:24:34,992 --> 01:24:36,609
Will you drink my health?

973
01:24:54,236 --> 01:24:55,951
To the bottom!

974
01:24:56,530 --> 01:24:59,762
For one's health,
you must drink to the bottom.

975
01:25:16,061 --> 01:25:18,638
Take a bite,
or you'll get drunk.

976
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:28,773
I'll feed you!

977
01:25:29,748 --> 01:25:33,764
Come on...

978
01:25:41,304 --> 01:25:43,158
Be seated.

979
01:25:43,926 --> 01:25:45,294
No, I'm not allowed.

980
01:25:46,387 --> 01:25:48,233
I'm master here.

981
01:25:48,610 --> 01:25:50,068
I allow you.

982
01:25:50,094 --> 01:25:52,089
Sit down!

983
01:26:25,923 --> 01:26:28,121
You know all the people
are scared of you?

984
01:26:31,568 --> 01:26:32,956
But you're kind of...

985
01:26:33,109 --> 01:26:34,378
Kind of what?

986
01:26:35,421 --> 01:26:36,385
Kind of funny.

987
01:26:37,807 --> 01:26:39,791
That's right.

988
01:26:40,868 --> 01:26:43,531
And for that,
women love me.

989
01:26:54,612 --> 01:26:55,715
Let's drink to Stalin.

990
01:26:56,683 --> 01:26:59,072
No, no, that's enough I
cannot drink anymore.

991
01:26:59,790 --> 01:27:01,019
You refuse to drink to Stalin?

992
01:27:37,729 --> 01:27:38,745
I was so worried...

993
01:27:39,212 --> 01:27:40,333
Did you serve them alright?

994
01:27:40,476 --> 01:27:41,849
Who was it?

995
01:27:42,427 --> 01:27:42,925
Beria.

996
01:27:45,109 --> 01:27:46,143
Did you drink?

997
01:27:46,353 --> 01:27:47,713
It was his date.

998
01:27:49,385 --> 01:27:50,613
Where is your bra?

999
01:27:52,921 --> 01:27:55,405
Bra? I think I lost it.

1000
01:27:55,702 --> 01:27:58,087
Have you packed your things?

1001
01:28:00,082 --> 01:28:00,945
Where is she going?

1002
01:28:01,438 --> 01:28:02,300
To carriage 11.

1003
01:28:02,503 --> 01:28:04,998
According to regulations,
a waitress must stay close to the kitchen!

1004
01:28:04,998 --> 01:28:06,143
day and night.

1005
01:28:06,143 --> 01:28:07,231
You must be tired!

1006
01:28:07,904 --> 01:28:09,054
I'll accompany you.

1007
01:28:16,532 --> 01:28:17,390
And you stay here!

1008
01:28:17,493 --> 01:28:18,755
Lover Boy.

1009
01:28:58,442 --> 01:28:59,149
Sanshin!

1010
01:29:03,159 --> 01:29:05,356
Word come on the wire
from Lieutenant General Vlasik

1011
01:29:06,184 --> 01:29:07,398
You are wanted back there.

1012
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:10,315
Urgently, so don't unpack!
You'll go by this train.

1013
01:29:11,317 --> 01:29:11,895
Back where?

1014
01:29:12,311 --> 01:29:13,240
Back to Moscow.

1015
01:29:14,607 --> 01:29:15,310
They say the Master

1016
01:29:15,796 --> 01:29:17,090
changed his mind about leaving.

1017
01:29:18,258 --> 01:29:18,942
But what about my wife?

1018
01:29:20,178 --> 01:29:20,753
Wife?

1019
01:29:22,811 --> 01:29:24,699
I came here with my wife.

1020
01:29:25,088 --> 01:29:27,272
She's enlisted as a waiter.
She's in the carriage 11.

1021
01:29:28,644 --> 01:29:29,846
Oh, your wife. Of course.

1022
01:29:30,676 --> 01:29:32,483
Don't worry. She's still enlisted,

1023
01:29:32,845 --> 01:29:34,854
and she'll work
in the Council of Ministers.

1024
01:29:36,619 --> 01:29:38,197
I haven't seen her in two days!

1025
01:29:38,383 --> 01:29:39,815
I would like to say goodbye.

1026
01:29:41,968 --> 01:29:44,846
You have a pass
to enter Comrade Beria's carriage?

1027
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:46,518
If not, you'd better stay here.

1028
01:29:46,938 --> 01:29:48,274
You will return to Moscow,
in half an hour.

1029
01:30:01,194 --> 01:30:02,507
German bombs fell

1030
01:30:02,769 --> 01:30:04,342
as I walked from the train station.

1031
01:30:06,717 --> 01:30:08,803
I couldn't recognize my city,

1032
01:30:09,894 --> 01:30:13,759
my street, even my neighborhood school

1033
01:30:13,759 --> 01:30:15,403
was a burned out ruin.

1034
01:30:17,554 --> 01:30:19,363
But Moscow would survive.

1035
01:30:20,098 --> 01:30:22,055
Comrade Stalin remained in the Kremlin

1036
01:30:22,564 --> 01:30:23,801
to protect us.

1037
01:30:55,961 --> 01:30:56,840
Who's there?

1038
01:30:57,884 --> 01:30:58,491
I'm armed!

1039
01:30:59,086 --> 01:31:00,019
I will shoot!

1040
01:31:11,095 --> 01:31:11,999
Come out now!

1041
01:31:13,611 --> 01:31:14,801
There are many of us here.

1042
01:31:18,244 --> 01:31:19,271
Calm down, Professor!

1043
01:31:19,915 --> 01:31:20,817
It's just me!

1044
01:31:22,109 --> 01:31:23,143
So you didn't go away?

1045
01:31:23,719 --> 01:31:24,593
Gone and back.

1046
01:31:25,697 --> 01:31:27,124
My boss decided to stay in Moscow.

1047
01:31:28,287 --> 01:31:30,317
Then there are still
brave people around!

1048
01:31:31,536 --> 01:31:32,565
No doubt about it!

1049
01:31:35,452 --> 01:31:36,852
But where is Anastasia?

1050
01:31:38,145 --> 01:31:39,430
Anastasia, old man,

1051
01:31:41,208 --> 01:31:42,565
Is just a fleeting pleasure.

1052
01:31:44,050 --> 01:31:47,897
Now you see her;
Now you don't.

1053
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:49,848
What do you mean?

1054
01:31:50,020 --> 01:31:51,237
I dumped her.

1055
01:31:51,265 --> 01:31:52,865
Fed up!

1056
01:31:53,145 --> 01:31:54,579
I sent her to Kuibyshev.

1057
01:31:55,715 --> 01:31:56,948
I'll file for divorce later.

1058
01:31:58,085 --> 01:31:59,510
But she's a good woman!

1059
01:31:59,610 --> 01:32:00,506
Good?

1060
01:32:00,912 --> 01:32:01,787
Slut!

1061
01:32:03,905 --> 01:32:05,043
Don't worry, professor!

1062
01:32:07,248 --> 01:32:09,336
We'll manage somehow,
just the two of us.

1063
01:32:11,375 --> 01:32:12,267
It's a shame!

1064
01:32:13,057 --> 01:32:14,530
She was always nice to me!

1065
01:32:15,992 --> 01:32:18,239
She even calledl me "Grandpa".

1066
01:32:49,425 --> 01:32:50,829
So how do you like it?

1067
01:32:55,435 --> 01:32:57,161
Well?

1068
01:33:05,837 --> 01:33:07,405
How do you like it?

1069
01:33:07,912 --> 01:33:10,062
You can put your eyes
back in your head!

1070
01:33:15,851 --> 01:33:17,474
I just wanted to see you for a minute.

1071
01:33:18,079 --> 01:33:19,285
Just for fun

1072
01:33:22,637 --> 01:33:24,133
Besides, the bags are heavy.

1073
01:33:37,650 --> 01:33:38,962
We're getting off in Dzerginsky.

1074
01:33:39,574 --> 01:33:40,189
Why Dzerginsky?

1075
01:33:41,553 --> 01:33:43,483
You think I was expecting
you to take me home?

1076
01:33:44,688 --> 01:33:46,602
I have a room at the KGB
dormitory.

1077
01:33:49,005 --> 01:33:50,291
As a single mother.

1078
01:33:54,486 --> 01:33:55,887
So why didn't you stay in Kuibyshev?

1079
01:33:59,513 --> 01:34:01,675
Who the hell meets people
in Kuibyshev like this?

1080
01:34:06,093 --> 01:34:07,861
We're going home!

1081
01:34:09,259 --> 01:34:10,411
You want me to live with you?

1082
01:34:11,099 --> 01:34:12,211
We're still married.

1083
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:15,530
You kill me!

1084
01:34:19,544 --> 01:34:20,581
You forgot!

1085
01:34:21,131 --> 01:34:22,733
You love Stalin better than me!

1086
01:34:23,078 --> 01:34:23,811
What are you talking about?

1087
01:34:29,083 --> 01:34:29,862
For you.

1088
01:34:31,255 --> 01:34:32,612
Why didn't you write
me one letter?

1089
01:34:35,154 --> 01:34:35,934
Not one.

1090
01:34:37,266 --> 01:34:38,280
In the whole year!

1091
01:34:40,686 --> 01:34:41,603
I did!

1092
01:34:43,771 --> 01:34:45,358
I just never sent it.

1093
01:34:59,746 --> 01:35:01,928
I'm so glad Anastasia
is back!

1094
01:35:02,704 --> 01:35:04,873
And it looks like
a baby is on the way!

1095
01:35:07,310 --> 01:35:09,412
What a rascal you are!
You didn't say a word.

1096
01:35:13,366 --> 01:35:14,887
The porridge will be ready in a minute.

1097
01:35:23,459 --> 01:35:24,547
I don't understand.

1098
01:35:27,684 --> 01:35:29,349
You couldn't find a better woman?

1099
01:35:38,072 --> 01:35:39,349
Ever since you went away, Nastia,

1100
01:35:41,413 --> 01:35:42,593
I cursed you, I hated you

1101
01:35:42,781 --> 01:35:44,497
I tried hard to forget you,

1102
01:35:45,901 --> 01:35:48,561
but every time
I get into bed,

1103
01:35:48,561 --> 01:35:51,688
the pillow smells of you,

1104
01:35:53,556 --> 01:35:55,297
and I start crying.

1105
01:36:01,474 --> 01:36:03,568
Do you remember that night,
under the bridge?

1106
01:36:04,410 --> 01:36:05,374
Hiding from the rain?

1107
01:36:07,305 --> 01:36:08,213
I tried to kiss you,

1108
01:36:08,558 --> 01:36:11,547
and that stupid dog
came out of nowhere and bit me!

1109
01:36:14,449 --> 01:36:16,313
God.. my only pants!

1110
01:36:18,255 --> 01:36:19,293
And the smell of your hair...

1111
01:36:22,437 --> 01:36:23,271
Your hair...

1112
01:36:26,460 --> 01:36:27,592
I don't need this!

1113
01:36:28,380 --> 01:36:29,970
I'm going to the dorm!

1114
01:36:29,970 --> 01:36:31,094
You're going away?

1115
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:33,135
Just leave me alone
and don't touch me!

1116
01:36:37,710 --> 01:36:38,989
Can I have some water..?

1117
01:36:48,123 --> 01:36:51,143
Why do you tell me
the pillow smelled like me?

1118
01:36:54,728 --> 01:36:55,795
Why?

1119
01:36:57,918 --> 01:37:01,206
I should be killed,
I should be crushed!

1120
01:37:03,913 --> 01:37:07,173
Listen! There is nothing,
nothing, that is your fault!

1121
01:37:08,184 --> 01:37:10,024
It's mine, it's my fault.

1122
01:37:10,884 --> 01:37:12,279
I didn't stand by you.

1123
01:37:12,279 --> 01:37:14,909
I didn't fight, I didn't resist!

1124
01:37:15,408 --> 01:37:16,813
Fighting whom, Ivan?

1125
01:37:19,602 --> 01:37:20,574
Fight who?

1126
01:37:23,332 --> 01:37:25,609
Can you guess who
the father of the child is?

1127
01:37:30,217 --> 01:37:32,052
I don't want to know.

1128
01:37:34,682 --> 01:37:36,027
I don't care!

1129
01:37:43,019 --> 01:37:44,962
All that matters is that
you're here!

1130
01:37:45,474 --> 01:37:46,511
And we're together.

1131
01:37:47,217 --> 01:37:49,851
As for the baby,
it will be our child, alright?

1132
01:37:53,751 --> 01:37:54,298
Right?

1133
01:37:56,156 --> 01:37:58,824
They've called you and
asked you to be nice to me haven't they?

1134
01:38:01,416 --> 01:38:02,630
Haven't they?

1135
01:38:08,044 --> 01:38:09,996
Do you think the KGB ordered me to

1136
01:38:09,996 --> 01:38:11,261
write all these love letters to you?

1137
01:38:11,261 --> 01:38:12,186
Write them every day

1138
01:38:13,308 --> 01:38:13,761
Read them!

1139
01:38:14,543 --> 01:38:15,589
Read them, you bitch!

1140
01:38:29,883 --> 01:38:31,891
I rescued it from a
bombed-out school.

1141
01:38:32,473 --> 01:38:35,443
When the war is over,
the pupils will get it back..

1142
01:38:39,973 --> 01:38:44,845
Oh, my God!

1143
01:39:16,264 --> 01:39:17,283
I want some too.

1144
01:39:17,283 --> 01:39:19,266
You've had one. That's enough.

1145
01:39:21,029 --> 01:39:22,013
To Your health, my dear!

1146
01:39:22,670 --> 01:39:24,088
Happy birthday!
-Happy Birthday!

1147
01:39:33,228 --> 01:39:34,075
Nastia!

1148
01:39:34,681 --> 01:39:35,653
Why don't you eat?

1149
01:39:35,653 --> 01:39:37,539
This is real chocolate!
It's American!

1150
01:39:37,668 --> 01:39:39,718
I want a mothball.

1151
01:39:39,933 --> 01:39:41,705
Here she goes..

1152
01:39:43,561 --> 01:39:45,511
Grandpa, have you got
any mothballs lying around?

1153
01:39:46,582 --> 01:39:47,366
What for dear?

1154
01:39:47,708 --> 01:39:48,641
Don't listen to her, Professor.

1155
01:39:49,624 --> 01:39:52,599
She's gotten it into her head
that mothballs are good for her.

1156
01:39:54,634 --> 01:39:56,513
Good thing I caught her yesterday,
before she ate one!

1157
01:39:57,768 --> 01:39:59,003
I need mothballs!

1158
01:39:59,181 --> 01:40:00,443
I've got moths inside me!

1159
01:40:01,173 --> 01:40:02,641
Sometimes they're flying in my head!

1160
01:40:03,693 --> 01:40:06,824
Sometimes in my stomach.
They're very ticklish!

1161
01:40:08,711 --> 01:40:11,452
The baby's all covered with fur,
that's why the moths are there.

1162
01:40:11,946 --> 01:40:14,321
Nastia, don't start this.
Don't start this..

1163
01:40:16,321 --> 01:40:18,213
You think I'm telling lies?

1164
01:40:19,416 --> 01:40:22,056
But Grandpa believes me, don't you?

1165
01:40:24,813 --> 01:40:26,278
Well. That's enough!

1166
01:40:27,352 --> 01:40:28,230
Let's go home.

1167
01:40:29,270 --> 01:40:30,245
I don't want to!

1168
01:40:34,018 --> 01:40:35,683
You don't love me anymore!

1169
01:40:38,276 --> 01:40:39,227
He used to love me,

1170
01:40:41,034 --> 01:40:42,286
and care for me

1171
01:40:42,771 --> 01:40:44,234
He hid me in the wardrobe!

1172
01:40:45,211 --> 01:40:46,800
Now he hidess Him there.

1173
01:40:47,201 --> 01:40:47,985
Stalin!

1174
01:40:48,146 --> 01:40:48,916
Nastia!

1175
01:40:48,916 --> 01:40:51,621
Did you know, Grandpa, that Stalin
is hiding in our wardrobe?

1176
01:40:53,041 --> 01:40:55,979
In the Kremlin it's not Stalin,
it's the Evil Spirit.

1177
01:40:56,289 --> 01:40:56,912
Anastasia!

1178
01:40:57,812 --> 01:40:59,423
I know!
I was told everything.

1179
01:41:01,096 --> 01:41:01,995
It's Satan in the Kremlin!

1180
01:41:03,152 --> 01:41:05,832
His left hand is all withered.

1181
01:41:06,742 --> 01:41:10,234
And the toes on his left foot,
all grown together like a hoof.

1182
01:41:13,896 --> 01:41:15,835
That's why he wears those soft boots.

1183
01:41:17,300 --> 01:41:18,949
And likes to stroll alone..

1184
01:41:22,943 --> 01:41:24,006
Between the flowers...

1185
01:41:30,944 --> 01:41:32,646
Come on. Let's put you to bed.

1186
01:41:34,744 --> 01:41:36,174
Eat the chocolate, professor!

1187
01:41:37,090 --> 01:41:38,923
Help yourself!
We've got plenty more!

1188
01:41:47,109 --> 01:41:48,284
I asked him not to drink.

1189
01:41:48,873 --> 01:41:50,027
We could all go to prison.

1190
01:41:51,723 --> 01:41:53,130
Don't be afraid, Ivan!

1191
01:41:53,532 --> 01:41:54,440
They won't touch us.

1192
01:41:56,111 --> 01:41:58,571
I am held in highest regard by
the KGB.

1193
01:42:00,978 --> 01:42:02,323
the valiant KGB!

1194
01:42:10,828 --> 01:42:13,596
Look, what a great moon!

1195
01:42:23,205 --> 01:42:24,601
Katya, must be cold,

1196
01:42:27,870 --> 01:42:29,712
standing there,
by the fence. Waiting.

1197
01:42:33,786 --> 01:42:35,018
In the nettles.

1198
01:42:39,839 --> 01:42:41,652
Little Katya Gubelman.

1199
01:42:55,258 --> 01:42:56,093
It's horrible, professor!

1200
01:42:58,202 --> 01:42:59,324
Something is wrong in her head.

1201
01:43:02,270 --> 01:43:03,426
Yesterday, waiting in line,

1202
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:05,858
She bit an old woman.

1203
01:43:07,001 --> 01:43:07,824
Well maybe she's crazy,

1204
01:43:09,202 --> 01:43:10,320
but what she said is the truth.

1205
01:43:12,570 --> 01:43:13,737
Satan is in the Kremlin!

1206
01:43:15,733 --> 01:43:16,907
What?

1207
01:43:18,998 --> 01:43:19,945
It is Satan.

1208
01:43:20,664 --> 01:43:23,004
It takes Satan to mesmerize
the whole nation

1209
01:43:23,409 --> 01:43:26,654
to the point where they
voluntarily blind and deafen themselves..

1210
01:43:48,833 --> 01:43:50,338
What else?

1211
01:43:51,223 --> 01:43:52,739
What else do you want to say?

1212
01:43:54,143 --> 01:43:56,844
Historically, the Russian people
either side with God or Satan.

1213
01:43:59,054 --> 01:44:01,798
Now we're dominated by an evil force.

1214
01:44:02,979 --> 01:44:05,310
And we worship him like
worship God.

1215
01:44:07,016 --> 01:44:08,806
You old man
you know nothing!

1216
01:44:11,407 --> 01:44:12,507
I work in the Kremlin.

1217
01:44:14,513 --> 01:44:15,690
I work with him.

1218
01:44:16,165 --> 01:44:19,185
I have the privilege,
the happiness to see him!

1219
01:44:20,145 --> 01:44:20,903
Every day.

1220
01:44:21,700 --> 01:44:23,087
Who are you?
Who sent you?

1221
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:24,740
Who are you conspiring with?

1222
01:44:24,740 --> 01:44:25,765
You stinkin' rat!

1223
01:44:25,765 --> 01:44:28,016
You think I don't see?
I'll bash your head,

1224
01:44:28,150 --> 01:44:29,470
I'll spread your brains
all over these books!

1225
01:44:42,343 --> 01:44:45,830
Mark my words.
If it were not for such good, naive,

1226
01:44:46,108 --> 01:44:48,973
and trusting Ivans
... as you are...

1227
01:44:48,973 --> 01:44:54,883
... He would never have been a
tyrant, a murderer, a devil.

1228
01:44:58,953 --> 01:44:59,937
Now go!

1229
01:45:00,503 --> 01:45:01,559
Please go!

1230
01:45:02,663 --> 01:45:04,311
Leave me alone.

1231
01:46:06,941 --> 01:46:07,732
Goodbye, Ivan.

1232
01:46:08,976 --> 01:46:11,353
Take my brown wool
jacket to Katya.

1233
01:46:12,243 --> 01:46:14,362
She must be cold.

1234
01:46:47,069 --> 01:46:47,767
Comrade Stalin!

1235
01:46:54,259 --> 01:46:59,313
Ah, comrade Sanshin!

1236
01:46:59,842 --> 01:47:02,609
But why are you here,
without your guard?

1237
01:47:04,384 --> 01:47:05,725
Who should I be afraid of, Ivan?

1238
01:47:07,066 --> 01:47:09,770
Anything could happen!
Let me walk with you!

1239
01:47:11,177 --> 01:47:12,815
I love walking alone.

1240
01:47:13,528 --> 01:47:14,620
So you live here?

1241
01:47:16,448 --> 01:47:17,395
Those are my windows.

1242
01:47:19,938 --> 01:47:21,913
Isn't it damp in the basement?

1243
01:47:22,268 --> 01:47:24,450
It's a first-rate basement,
comrade Stalin!

1244
01:47:24,450 --> 01:47:25,616
Warm and dry!

1245
01:47:30,397 --> 01:47:31,906
How is your wife, kids?

1246
01:47:32,187 --> 01:47:33,673
My wife is pregnant.

1247
01:47:33,821 --> 01:47:35,141
Expecting the baby soon.

1248
01:47:35,141 --> 01:47:36,208
Our first!

1249
01:47:36,846 --> 01:47:37,617
That's good.

1250
01:47:38,291 --> 01:47:40,118
Children are our future.

1251
01:47:42,626 --> 01:47:43,575
So life is good!

1252
01:47:45,917 --> 01:47:47,161
No complaints,
whatsoever!

1253
01:47:48,726 --> 01:47:52,875
So goodbye, comrade Sanshin!

1254
01:48:12,484 --> 01:48:13,816
Is something wrong, Comrade Stalin?

1255
01:48:14,907 --> 01:48:17,493
How long have you worked
with me Sanshin?

1256
01:48:18,862 --> 01:48:20,893
Five years.. in the Inner Circle!

1257
01:48:22,498 --> 01:48:25,153
They say that I'm suspicious
of everyone.

1258
01:48:26,652 --> 01:48:28,829
But how can I trust anyone,

1259
01:48:29,982 --> 01:48:32,827
when even you,
in the Inner Circle

1260
01:48:33,032 --> 01:48:33,892
lie to me?

1261
01:48:38,193 --> 01:48:39,534
You've got no wife.

1262
01:48:41,448 --> 01:48:44,173
She hanged herself 20 minutes ago.

1263
01:48:46,043 --> 01:48:48,240
You see, I know everything

1264
01:48:48,515 --> 01:48:51,162
Everything about everyone.

1265
01:49:13,086 --> 01:49:15,800
I buried Anastasia in the frozen earth.

1266
01:49:16,845 --> 01:49:19,014
The KGB paid for the burial.

1267
01:49:20,527 --> 01:49:21,695
The war was won.

1268
01:49:22,379 --> 01:49:24,178
Comrade Stalin had saved us.

1269
01:49:24,989 --> 01:49:27,216
Our nation resumed its march

1270
01:49:27,269 --> 01:49:29,448
toward the Great
Socialist Destiny.

1271
01:49:30,668 --> 01:49:32,036
But I felt nothing.

1272
01:49:33,223 --> 01:49:35,235
My heart had been buried too.

1273
01:49:37,178 --> 01:49:39,356
Ten years of winter passed.

1274
01:49:40,123 --> 01:49:42,025
Next stop, Slaughterhouse.

1275
01:49:57,667 --> 01:49:59,536
Ivan, look who's here!

1276
01:50:00,535 --> 01:50:01,827
Do you recognize her?

1277
01:50:03,793 --> 01:50:07,862
Do you recognize her?
It's Katya, the Gubelmans' daughter!

1278
01:50:09,385 --> 01:50:10,395
What are you talking about?

1279
01:50:12,052 --> 01:50:13,266
The Gubelmans!

1280
01:50:14,044 --> 01:50:15,120
Sonia and Aaron.

1281
01:50:15,947 --> 01:50:17,077
You lost your memory?

1282
01:50:18,257 --> 01:50:19,503
I don't remember
any Gubelmans.

1283
01:50:26,916 --> 01:50:28,130
She came to visit you.

1284
01:50:29,785 --> 01:50:30,630
Do you hear me!

1285
01:50:32,612 --> 01:50:33,767
I have a rule
about visiting.

1286
01:50:34,512 --> 01:50:35,699
I visit no one

1287
01:50:35,855 --> 01:50:36,766
and no one visits me.

1288
01:50:38,295 --> 01:50:41,487
This can't be the one
Anastasia told me about!

1289
01:50:42,127 --> 01:50:42,893
He's the one!

1290
01:50:44,717 --> 01:50:45,900
Oh please, don't knock!
I must go.

1291
01:50:53,979 --> 01:50:54,905
Are you coming in?

1292
01:50:55,982 --> 01:50:56,667
Yes!

1293
01:51:07,950 --> 01:51:09,987
It's better now because,
I have my passport.

1294
01:51:11,335 --> 01:51:12,470
Wait how old are you?

1295
01:51:12,470 --> 01:51:13,267
17.

1296
01:51:14,435 --> 01:51:15,122
17?

1297
01:51:17,548 --> 01:51:18,096
That's Right.

1298
01:51:32,244 --> 01:51:33,259
Have some jam in your tea.

1299
01:51:36,109 --> 01:51:36,751
Do you like jam?

1300
01:51:38,119 --> 01:51:38,869
Gooseberry.

1301
01:51:40,112 --> 01:51:41,244
Full of vitamins.

1302
01:51:41,244 --> 01:51:42,588
Vitamins are good for you.

1303
01:51:45,930 --> 01:51:47,879
Do you know what Stalin's
favorite jam is?

1304
01:51:49,515 --> 01:51:50,567
What?

1305
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:52,852
What he likes most of all..

1306
01:51:53,545 --> 01:51:55,280
Jam with rose petals.

1307
01:51:57,700 --> 01:51:58,950
How do you know that?

1308
01:51:59,160 --> 01:52:01,920
I know a lot about
Comrade Stalin!

1309
01:52:02,015 --> 01:52:05,041
He smokes rolled cigarettes
flowers brand

1310
01:52:05,318 --> 01:52:06,723
and he loves to sing a
Georgian song

1311
01:52:09,249 --> 01:52:09,984
... I forgot the name.

1312
01:52:20,910 --> 01:52:21,406
.. Zulikov.

1313
01:52:22,870 --> 01:52:23,454
That's it.

1314
01:52:26,525 --> 01:52:28,525
So you love Comrade Stalin!

1315
01:52:29,220 --> 01:52:30,363
I would die for him!

1316
01:52:31,775 --> 01:52:37,185
If it weren't for Comrade Stalin,
I would have been dead a long time ago.

1317
01:52:39,065 --> 01:52:42,400
He saw to it that I was fed and clothed,
and educated

1318
01:52:42,400 --> 01:52:43,478
by the State.

1319
01:52:52,714 --> 01:52:53,745
Sorry, I didn't see..

1320
01:52:54,235 --> 01:52:56,867
Don't be scared.
I won't tell anyone!

1321
01:53:12,180 --> 01:53:13,066
Do you have relatives?

1322
01:53:14,540 --> 01:53:15,669
An aunt or someone?

1323
01:53:25,170 --> 01:53:28,868
Aunt Anastasia has it been
long since she died?

1324
01:53:30,552 --> 01:53:31,174
During the war.

1325
01:53:35,108 --> 01:53:37,338
She talked about you. A lot.

1326
01:53:39,348 --> 01:53:39,852
She did?

1327
01:53:53,591 --> 01:53:54,482
Take it!

1328
01:53:55,086 --> 01:53:58,227
It's her sweater.
It's a little big

1329
01:53:59,411 --> 01:54:00,222
but it's warm!

1330
01:54:03,245 --> 01:54:03,811
For me?

1331
01:54:04,622 --> 01:54:05,186
For you!

1332
01:54:07,815 --> 01:54:09,955
She was thinking of you just
before she died, that..

1333
01:54:12,233 --> 01:54:13,982
you were cold and lonely.

1334
01:54:16,059 --> 01:54:17,132
It's yours now.

1335
01:54:18,393 --> 01:54:19,783
She asked me to give it to you.

1336
01:54:29,426 --> 01:54:31,262
She didn't forget me!

1337
01:54:34,803 --> 01:54:36,396
She didn't forget me!

1338
01:54:37,152 --> 01:54:39,083
Come on now, don't cry!

1339
01:54:40,389 --> 01:54:42,562
She was thinking of me!

1340
01:54:54,953 --> 01:54:56,729
She was thinking of me!

1341
01:56:07,840 --> 01:56:09,386
Come on, let's eat!

1342
01:56:11,164 --> 01:56:12,832
Uncle Ivan, what's that on the wall?

1343
01:56:15,758 --> 01:56:16,248
I don't know.

1344
01:56:17,278 --> 01:56:17,752
I know..

1345
01:56:18,650 --> 01:56:19,184
It's blood.

1346
01:56:20,229 --> 01:56:22,086
The blood of Aaron Gubelman, my father!

1347
01:56:23,226 --> 01:56:24,336
What are you saying?

1348
01:56:25,220 --> 01:56:25,847
I remember!

1349
01:56:26,365 --> 01:56:28,238
You can'tt remember,
you were only 3 years old!

1350
01:56:28,608 --> 01:56:30,714
I remember he bashed his head
against the wall,

1351
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:31,714
Then did it again.

1352
01:56:32,725 --> 01:56:35,315
He wanted to escape from justice.
But they wouldn't let him!

1353
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:37,455
What an imagination!

1354
01:56:38,210 --> 01:56:38,908
It's just glue!

1355
01:56:39,733 --> 01:56:42,078
Nastia spilled it fixing the wallpaper.

1356
01:56:42,952 --> 01:56:44,554
Come on!
The eggs are getting cold.

1357
01:57:00,969 --> 01:57:01,487
Listen!

1358
01:57:06,500 --> 01:57:07,686
You shouldn't come here again..

1359
01:57:09,272 --> 01:57:10,185
And don't tell anyone

1360
01:57:10,292 --> 01:57:11,177
that you spent the night here.

1361
01:57:12,213 --> 01:57:13,805
I was thinking that myself.

1362
01:57:13,813 --> 01:57:15,399
I might get you into trouble!

1363
01:57:15,610 --> 01:57:17,678
You see, it's my job...

1364
01:57:17,940 --> 01:57:20,893
Don't worry,
I understand.

1365
01:57:22,154 --> 01:57:23,255
I didn't want to stay here..

1366
01:57:27,263 --> 01:57:28,870
Go ahead! Eat.

1367
01:57:31,118 --> 01:57:32,412
No I'm full, thank you!

1368
01:57:34,054 --> 01:57:34,973
I have to go now

1369
01:57:40,917 --> 01:57:42,485
So where will you go?

1370
01:57:42,841 --> 01:57:45,010
Oh, it's a big country!

1371
01:57:46,260 --> 01:57:47,826
I might go to Siberia

1372
01:57:48,030 --> 01:57:50,401
to work on the dam construction

1373
01:57:50,770 --> 01:57:52,280
What a silly idea!

1374
01:57:52,280 --> 01:57:55,455
What's a sparrow like you
going to do in Siberia all alone?

1375
01:57:55,455 --> 01:57:57,150
You should finish school,

1376
01:57:57,150 --> 01:57:58,278
Go to university,

1377
01:57:58,453 --> 01:58:00,759
you could be a lawyer, doctor...

1378
01:58:02,525 --> 01:58:04,128
What are you talking about, Uncle Ivan?

1379
01:58:04,410 --> 01:58:05,083
I am a Jew!

1380
01:58:08,835 --> 01:58:10,525
I am a Jew.

1381
01:58:10,525 --> 01:58:13,810
Let alone my parents
enemies of the people.

1382
01:58:14,605 --> 01:58:15,689
So what?

1383
01:58:17,919 --> 01:58:20,411
There are Jews even
in the government!

1384
01:58:22,824 --> 01:58:24,378
Oh, Uncle Ivan!

1385
01:58:26,300 --> 01:58:27,451
You are so naive!

1386
01:58:49,628 --> 01:58:50,589
Here's some money for you.

1387
01:58:51,380 --> 01:58:52,425
I have 3,000 rubles saved.

1388
01:58:55,918 --> 01:58:57,617
And a warm hat for the winter.

1389
01:59:03,111 --> 01:59:04,068
You're so kind!

1390
01:59:10,002 --> 01:59:11,565
Aunt Anastasia told me many times

1391
01:59:11,957 --> 01:59:13,162
how kind you are.

1392
01:59:14,184 --> 01:59:14,655
Ivan?

1393
01:59:15,588 --> 01:59:16,839
Phone call for you.

1394
01:59:23,921 --> 01:59:24,822
Sanshin speaking.

1395
01:59:25,276 --> 01:59:28,141
-Ivan Sanshin? Ivan Sergeevich.
-Sir!

1396
01:59:28,277 --> 01:59:32,537
You are to report immediately
to department 1, room 6.

1397
01:59:32,797 --> 01:59:35,097
-To see General Schelkasov.
-Send a car.

1398
01:59:35,421 --> 01:59:36,435
It's an emergency!

1399
01:59:36,751 --> 01:59:37,578
No cars available.

1400
01:59:52,324 --> 01:59:54,032
Dear Uncle Ivan,

1401
01:59:54,394 --> 01:59:57,219
I'm leaving behind the money
and the hat.

1402
01:59:58,139 --> 02:00:00,539
I'm afraid someone
might steal them.

1403
02:00:00,539 --> 02:00:02,965
And as for Aunt Anastasia's sweater..

1404
02:00:03,757 --> 02:00:05,059
It's dear to you
too.

1405
02:00:05,478 --> 02:00:08,703
So please keep
it in memory of her.

1406
02:00:09,204 --> 02:00:11,137
I love you very, Katya.

1407
02:00:24,044 --> 02:00:25,334
Why like this?

1408
02:00:28,628 --> 02:00:31,530
Why on earth like this..?

1409
02:01:08,416 --> 02:01:11,987
This is a memorandum
of the Soviet government.

1410
02:01:16,970 --> 02:01:20,870
Yesterday, 05 March 1953

1411
02:01:22,008 --> 02:01:24,260
10:15 Moscow time,

1412
02:01:25,742 --> 02:01:28,613
The great leader of progressive mankind,

1413
02:01:29,513 --> 02:01:31,569
The founder of the Soviet state,

1414
02:01:33,019 --> 02:01:36,117
Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin,

1415
02:01:37,684 --> 02:01:38,639
died.

1416
02:01:42,097 --> 02:01:45,838
In this difficult time of irreplaceable
loss for our country,

1417
02:01:46,841 --> 02:01:51,085
The Soviet government asks its citizens
to stay calm,

1418
02:01:52,047 --> 02:01:53,373
and maintain order.

1419
02:01:54,827 --> 02:01:56,575
The body of Comrade Stalin,

1420
02:01:57,367 --> 02:02:00,145
will lie in state in the Hall of Columns.

1421
02:02:02,487 --> 02:02:04,405
The access to
the Hall of Columns,

1422
02:02:05,311 --> 02:02:08,040
Will only be from Pushkin Street.

1423
02:02:08,991 --> 02:02:12,618
All military personnel
of KGB Moscow Garrison

1424
02:02:13,642 --> 02:02:16,152
and police force
have reported for duty,

1425
02:02:16,375 --> 02:02:18,806
to maintain public order.

1426
02:02:20,884 --> 02:02:24,577
The Hall of Columns
will be open to the general public

1427
02:02:25,121 --> 02:02:30,628
from 9 am
on 9 March 1953.

1428
02:03:26,072 --> 02:03:28,236
Stop! You're going to crush each other!

1429
02:03:31,026 --> 02:03:32,692
You're going to crush each other!

1430
02:03:47,250 --> 02:03:52,932
Testing, 1,2,3,4 1,2,3,4

1431
02:04:11,312 --> 02:04:12,229
My crutches!

1432
02:04:12,743 --> 02:04:15,208
I need to pay my respects.

1433
02:04:15,784 --> 02:04:17,232
They crushed my foot!

1434
02:05:44,671 --> 02:05:45,625
Katya!

1435
02:05:52,167 --> 02:05:56,527
Katya!

1436
02:06:07,778 --> 02:06:09,193
Don't go there, they'll crush you!

1437
02:06:09,193 --> 02:06:13,798
I must!
I have to see Comrade Stalin.

1438
02:06:15,004 --> 02:06:17,201
Let me go! Let me go!

1439
02:06:17,574 --> 02:06:18,881
They'll crush you!

1440
02:06:18,975 --> 02:06:21,474
Let me go!! Leave me, Ivan.

1441
02:06:22,251 --> 02:06:23,717
You will die there!

1442
02:06:24,519 --> 02:06:25,699
I don't care!

1443
02:06:25,989 --> 02:06:29,706
I don't care!
I want to die!

1444
02:06:30,099 --> 02:06:31,635
I want to die! 

1445
02:06:34,651 --> 02:06:36,238
There is no life for me.

1446
02:06:36,864 --> 02:06:38,203
I will not let you die.

1447
02:06:38,453 --> 02:06:39,887
Who will take care of me?

1448
02:06:40,123 --> 02:06:41,904
I will! I will take care of you!

1449
02:06:42,930 --> 02:06:45,461
Katya, listen!

1450
02:06:46,473 --> 02:06:49,703
I will take care of you!

1451
02:06:50,263 --> 02:06:51,515
I'll never let you go!

1452
02:06:52,123 --> 02:06:54,054
This was Nastia's will!

1453
02:06:54,318 --> 02:06:56,073
I won't give you up to anyone!

1454
02:06:56,073 --> 02:06:57,348
You are my child!

1455
02:06:57,348 --> 02:06:59,469
You're my daughter!

1456
02:06:59,748 --> 02:07:02,339
My sweet, bright angel!

1457
02:07:03,418 --> 02:07:04,478
I won't let you go!

1458
02:07:04,775 --> 02:07:06,063
You are my child!

1459
02:07:06,260 --> 02:07:07,472
You're my daughter!

1460
02:07:09,973 --> 02:07:11,342
We'll go home!

1461
02:07:11,720 --> 02:07:13,323
I'll keep you warm!

1462
02:07:14,285 --> 02:07:16,305
My sweet, sweet girl!

1463
02:07:16,305 --> 02:07:17,806
Ivan!

1464
02:07:17,859 --> 02:07:19,331
Who do you love better?

1465
02:07:19,985 --> 02:07:22,409
Me or Comrade Stalin?

1466
02:07:28,534 --> 02:07:32,385
I love you...
most of all in the world!

1467
02:07:52,883 --> 02:08:04,993
Stalin was buried in the mausoleum near the Kremlin wall.
At his funeral, 1,500 people were trampled to death out of the crowd's desperate desire to see their leader one last time.

1468
02:08:04,993 --> 02:08:15,969
After nine months, Beria was accused of treason and shot.
Ivan still lives in Moscow.
Katya...How many Katyas there are still...
