1
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,355
- 17,500 lei.
- Coca-Cola and two packets of LM.

2
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,513
- Red or blue?
- Red.

3
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,476
- And two half-litres of cooking oil.
- We've run out.

4
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,016
- What about one-litre bottles?
- We're out of those, too.

5
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,350
- Then some medicinal spirit.
- Sorry. No spirit either.

6
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,034
- Is that all?
- Yes.

7
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,671
47500.

8
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,599
47500.

9
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,315
- Good morning, Mrs. Caty.
- Morning, Mr. Marcel.

10
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,038
- Is Ovidiu up?
- Yes, Mr. Marcel, go right in!

11
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,554
Mitica!

12
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,393
Fetch more beer from the bathtub,
if it's chilled!

13
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,518
Morning, Mr. Marcel.

14
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,077
Go right in, please.

15
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,274
Have a seat on the couch.
I'll be right back. Please go in.

16
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,434
Heavy...

17
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,036
- This is the last cold one.
- So, it's the last.

18
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,596
- How's it going, Mr. Marcel?
- Tough, Mr. Mitica!

19
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,314
I don't need to teach you
about doing business.

20
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,034
- I'd like a word with Ovidiu.
- I think he's still sleeping.

21
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,229
At this hour? It's 9 o'clock.

22
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,073
I told him I'd be here at 9.

23
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,317
He's not asleep. Go right in.

24
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,716
So he's awake.
Go right in, Mr. Marcel.

25
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,275
Mitica, move this, will vou!
It's my way.

26
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,159
My, oh, my!

27
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,792
- Morning, lad!
- Morning, sir!

28
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,750
What dou you think you're doing?

29
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:26,429
STUFF AND DOUGH

30
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,152
The packages have to get there
by 2 at the latest! It's 9 now.

31
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,871
By the time you get up, get dressed,
have a bite, it'll be 9:30.

32
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,076
By the time you start the car, your
mum gives you a kiss, it'll be 9:45.

33
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,069
If you leave by 10,
you'll be in Bucharest in 4 hours.

34
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,239
Listen up: You don't stop,
you don't buy soda...

35
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,673
- And you don't pick up hitchhikers.
- Yes.

36
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:23,950
You drive straight to your destination.

37
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,472
- Fill up at Competrol.
- I filled up last night.

38
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,072
Fill up so you don't run on empty.

39
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,918
- Alright?
- Yes.

40
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,549
- So where do you have to go?
- 16, Agricultori St.

41
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:43,598
- Bucharest, 16, Agricultori St.

42
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,951
- By what time?
- Two.

43
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,151
- How many packages?
- All of them.

44
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,159
Six!

45
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,591
- Six packages!
- Six packages.

46
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,394
- Better jot it down!
- I'll remember it.

47
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,240
Take a sheet of paper
and write down what I told you!

48
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,111
Hello? Hang on!

49
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,477
Haven't you got a proper sheet oî paper?
What do you use for bookkeepimg? Scraps?

50
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,768
Take a nice blank sheet
of A4, a ballpoint

51
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,791
pen, and write down what I said!

52
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,831
Come on, Ovidiu,
please, what the hell.

53
00:06:32,843 --> 00:06:33,843
Mother!

54
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,430
Turk, my man, have you got
everthing you need?

55
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,637
Yes, they're here in the car park.

56
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,150
I'll call you when the lad leaves.

57
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,071
When do you take a shit? Morning
or evening? Are you regular?

58
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,609
It's a serious question.
Take me: I shit

59
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:33,551
in the morning, at 9,
9:30 at the latest.

60
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,510
I can only shit at home.
Anywhere else, I hold it in.

61
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:43,080
You just sit on something hard
and force the shit back up.

62
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,756
You wriggle, you clench...
When do you take a shit?

63
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,191
In the evening, mostly.

64
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,871
Too bad! You can't rely on
a bloke who shits in the evening.

65
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,397
They all pull fast ones.

66
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,873
In your case it's good, because
you won't waste any more time now.

67
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,281
Hurry up! If you need
to go en route, you

68
00:08:07,293 --> 00:08:09,477
don't stop! Better
you shit yourself!

69
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,633
I'm joking, lad. But I'm very serious!

70
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,835
Jot it down:
"Thîngs to do". Underline it...

71
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,989
(Transport: 1) 6 packages...

72
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:28,074
(2) of medical substances...

73
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,469
What kind of medical substances?

74
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,171
Pharmaceuticals - it's
written on the box!

75
00:08:38,183 --> 00:08:39,709
That's all you need to know!

76
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,720
(3) Where?

77
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,230
Bucharest, 16, Agricultori St.

78
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:54,115
I've told you how to get there.
After lancului, turn left, then right...

79
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,315
- And straight ahead to number 16.
- Yes!

80
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,791
- (3) You ask for Mr. Doncea.
- 4) I ask for Mr. Doncea.

81
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,320
(4) You ask for Mr. Doncea.

82
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,595
(5) You unload the packages.

83
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,434
(6) You return double quick
to Constanta.

84
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,230
Here"s 1,000 greenbacks. YOU get
another grand on your return.

85
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,079
2,000 for a trip to Bucharest?

86
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,920
When you do a good job for me,
you'll be satisfied with the payoff.

87
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,398
That means, three more deliveries
and I can buy my own stall!

88
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,036
We'll see about that. If there'll be
more deliveries. I'll let you know.

89
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,279
Let's see the list!

90
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,592
Here are the packages.

91
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,270
Two Phenylbutazone,
three Preg... dnisone.

92
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,954
In brackets: % Extract. Sol. Phials.

93
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,796
And two Phenylbutazone.

94
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,079
Two more?

95
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,434
Here.

96
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,231
What about a delivery docket
in case I get stopped?

97
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,869
How about I send it by post
and you kiss the money goodbye?

98
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,955
Alright.

99
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,794
I"m off.

100
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,796
- Do I have to call you from Bucharest?
- Never mind that! You just drive.

101
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,078
What are you doing?

102
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,713
Get out of that bed!

103
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,195
I told you we're in a hurry!
Do I make myself clear or not?

104
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,150
- Just a sec...
- Get up and get on with it!

105
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,991
What does the list say?
Departure at 10.

106
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,993
And another thing:
Only we two know about this!

107
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,838
- Alright?
- Alright.

108
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,160
Want me to stay with you
till you get dressed?

109
00:11:20,172 --> 00:11:21,172
No.

110
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,749
What"s up?
We're off to Bucharest.

111
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,277
Yes, we're taking the van.

112
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,033
We have to deliver some medicine.
I don't know, medicine... You coming?

113
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,118
I don't know what time it is.

114
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,838
So, you're coming?
I can only wait until 10.

115
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,396
No! Who is she?
You're not bringing anybody.

116
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,749
Mother!

117
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,197
- Have I got any ironed T-shirts?
- Look in your cupboard!

118
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,518
- Where in the cupboard?
- The top shelf.

119
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,990
Didn't I iron them yesterday?
They're all laid out.

120
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,876
Don't leave before having a bite!
At least have some coffee.

121
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,994
I haven't got time.

122
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,150
What, leaving on an empty stomach?

123
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,956
- Is Vali going too?
- Yes.

124
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,912
Then who'll bring me my stuff
from the wholesaler's? I'm out of beer.

125
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,359
- When will you be back?
- I don't know...

126
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,151
- Tonight.
- I'll be out of stock until tomorrow.

127
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,556
Couldn't Ivanov have
given you more notice?

128
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,751
That's the way to do things,
in an organised way.

129
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,076
- Using your head, dear!
- That's right!

130
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,475
- Tell him you'll go tomorrow.
- I have to be in Bucharest by 2.

131
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,631
So what you go tomorrow?

132
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,519
- What have you got there?
- Medicine.

133
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,479
- I don't like that Ivanov.
- You're being unfair.

134
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,471
Two years ego, during the sugar shotage,
who helped you out?

135
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,192
I've known Ivanov since we worked at
the plant together. He's a good bloke.

136
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,995
He makes good money
and he's got a good life.

137
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,556
Right. You've got customers waiting.

138
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,639
- Don't get cheeky!
- They're kicking up a fuss outside...

139
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,959
- What's the big rush?
- I'll have a cuppa, Mum, but quick.

140
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,630
I can't right now. Let me feed grandma.

141
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,956
- 0r maybe you could feed her.
- Alright.

142
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,270
- When'll Vali be here?
- He's on his way.

143
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,836
Don't want any more?
Granny's had enough.

144
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,758
Take her to her room.

145
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,156
Let her sit down
and look of the window.

146
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,479
If you're going, I've got a list
of stuff for the shop.

147
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:52,750
- Thanks.
- Cooking oil, medicinal alcohol...

148
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,356
We'll have run out of beer by tonight.
There's not much Coke left, either.

149
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,110
Go to the wholesaler's
and buy all this.

150
00:15:01,122 --> 00:15:03,793
And lug it all the
way from Bucharest?

151
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,514
Big deal...

152
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,302
People come and ask
for a beer, a Coke...

153
00:15:10,314 --> 00:15:13,073
It's summer. You have
to keep them chilled.

154
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,009
If you're out of stock,
they go somewhere else.

155
00:15:16,021 --> 00:15:17,238
I'll buy your stuff tomorrow.

156
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,158
Or better send Dad.
He's not doing anything.

157
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,072
A cooler would do nicely.

158
00:15:27,084 --> 00:15:31,550
I know, but you don't
have room for it.

159
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,393
Wait until I get my own shop
and then we'll buy a cooler.

160
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,998
- I was talking about a display case.
- We'll get a cooler and a display case.

161
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,557
I'm going to sell sausages, as well.

162
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,072
Then we'll see about your moving out?

163
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,794
In two weeks at the latest
and I'll be out of here.

164
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,032
I'm getting the shop. I already
shook hands on it with the man.

165
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,509
Honest!

166
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,237
- Hello, madam!
- Hi!

167
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,076
Granny, how are you? Alright?

168
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,471
- Is this yours?
- Yeah, have some.

169
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,190
This is Betty, my girlfriend...
Mrs Caty... Granny...

170
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,114
That's Ovarian. Lefs go!

171
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,512
Let me write down the list...
Give the kids some coffee!

172
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,278
- Your treat?
- Sit down!

173
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,952
- With milk?
- Yes.

174
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,917
Alright, but quick!
Left down the hall and then right.

175
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,311
I's with sugar.
My mother made it.

176
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,395
That's alright.

177
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,912
Didn't I tell you to came alone?
Where did you pick her up?

178
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,429
- Îîdy bit oftackle. Eh?
- Yes, really good-looking.

179
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,839
- What about Laura?
- I's over.

180
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,796
You're through with Laura? Really?
And who's she?

181
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:11,511
- She's from Medgidia.
- When did you go to Medgidia?

182
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,274
I didn't. She came with my cousin
to Lips's party.

183
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,358
So she came after I left.

184
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:22,351
Vali, buy everything on the list!
The oil, the Coke, everything...

185
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,797
- Tomorrow, I told you.
- Whatever... Here's the money.

186
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,755
- What's on the list?
- What I said!

187
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,437
Betty, come on, we're leaving!

188
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,589
Give it here.

189
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,591
We'll stop by the wholesaler if we can.
Give me the money.

190
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,197
You got wheels?

191
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,319
Let's take yours. Mine car's acting up.

192
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,875
A heavy load will wreck the dampers.

193
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,717
- So we're taking the van?
- Yes.

194
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,359
- Bye.
- Get something to eat on the way!

195
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,312
You're driving me crazy.

196
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,238
Drive safely, son!

197
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,750
- Drive carefully!
- Leave them alone...

198
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,520
Don't get into trouble on me way!

199
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,116
Lord, why couldn't you have gone
to Bucharest tomorrow!

200
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,629
Ma, I'll sit you in front of TV.

201
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,833
Up we go! Easy does it!

202
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,439
I didn't shout at her!
She wouldn't shut up.

203
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,753
I told her I'd go tomorrow.

204
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,153
- She does all the work in the shop!
- I want her off my back!

205
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,873
Fasten your seatbelt.

206
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,634
Betty!

207
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,358
Came on. Your seatbelt!

208
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:42,592
When I have my own shop,
I'll hire an assistant, an accountant...

209
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,800
Then I'll move into my own bedsit,
what the fuck!

210
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,593
- You'll be my driver.
- Bugger off!

211
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,676
And if she wants to, she can keep
the shop in that building.

212
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,918
I'll visit them once a week
to ask after their health.

213
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,999
We have to turn left, via Cernavoda.

214
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,549
And they'll keep the busimess?

215
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,474
Ovarian, you'll be a big boss...

216
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,637
And you'll keep giving them money?

217
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,033
Sure I will.

218
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,071
What's one got to do with the other?

219
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,396
I mind my own business,
my parents mind theirs.

220
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,635
They're going to pull down this hotel
and build a car park.

221
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,919
No, I's to build a fast-food place.

222
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:33,275
No. It'll be a multi-storey car park,
car wash. Petrol station. The works...

223
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,551
Cool. Like in the West.

224
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,913
Did you get a look at her?

225
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,309
- What's ms music?
- Quality stuff!

226
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,156
- Guaranteed quality.
- Music from the 'hood.

227
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,918
We need to stop off at Nova 2000
to fill up with petrol.

228
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,030
- What are you laughing at?
- Star 2000. You patsy!

229
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,631
That was the name of a band.

230
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,712
Star 2000...
What's-his-name. Petrica Geambasu...

231
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,434
They used to dress up like Sinatra,
with spangles, play like this...

232
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,399
He was in the same class
as my father at school...

233
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,437
You must be kidding:
See those buildings?

234
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,714
Ever hear of Chirvase,
the car guy with the world record?

235
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,830
If he got it into his head,
he could jump these fences,

236
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,156
and crash straight into someone's flat.

237
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,072
Hear about that accident in Sibiu?

238
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:25,393
A drunk driver in Audi flew off a
bridge, crashed haW-way inside a house.

239
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,157
He wasn't killed.
He stayed for dinner.

240
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,597
And what about the people
with a car in their living room...

241
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,679
So what they do? Listen to this!

242
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,156
We've got right of way.

243
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:46,118
They moved into the haft of the car
thak was embedded in the building.

244
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,393
The accident guy left the car there?

245
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,678
- No, he took it away.
- So, the man left his car or not?

246
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,474
- You're slow.
- I don't get it.

247
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,752
So the man crashed
into his own house?

248
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,840
No. Ha crashed into this house,
then took his half of the car away...

249
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,950
Why not tell us about
how you jumped over the pond.

250
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,833
That was different...

251
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,676
- When did you jump over a pond?
- A while back.

252
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,033
- Come on, tell us!
- Forget it, that's different.

253
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,800
You jummped over Lake Techirghiol
in your car?

254
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,516
- You're doing my head in!
- Come on, Vali.

255
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,565
I'll take you to
Sibiu to see that car.

256
00:23:34,577 --> 00:23:36,319
Yeah, I'll look forward to it.

257
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,670
- Really? When?
- Soon.

258
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,919
Don't do that! I'll get all sweaty.

259
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,395
Yes. Yes, Mr. Marcel.

260
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,954
- Betty. I could use a backrub.
- Yes. We've left Constante.

261
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,794
About 5 or 10 minutes ago.

262
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,156
Yes, carefully, of course.

263
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,957
L haven't got a full tank.

264
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,233
I'll fill up if necessary.

265
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,873
Yes, I'll wait.

266
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,035
No, I thought you were angry with me.

267
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,952
If you don't mind...

268
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,240
Yes. Bye!

269
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,470
- Which Marcel? Ivanov?
- Yes, fuck him!

270
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:55,116
He got on my nerves this morning,
acting the big shot.

271
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:00,469
Don Marcelo...
I say watch your step.

272
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,310
What do you mean, "Watch your step"?

273
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:09,114
If he wants the to do something,
I don't. I'm no moron.

274
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,874
Who's this Marcel?

275
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,598
Roll up the window.
I's giving the a headache.

276
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,114
- You're sensitive to draughts?
- Who, Ovarian?

277
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,077
His face swells up like a balloon
from the draught.

278
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,399
Move it, man!

279
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,798
He was all uppity, said to go
straight to Bucharest,

280
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:41,917
none stop even if I was pissing myself,
to be in Bucharest by two at the latest.

281
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,477
Is that Ivanov's bag?

282
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,239
Say, dickhead,
did he cough up the dough?

283
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,635
Too fucking right he did!

284
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,878
- He's helping me buy a shop.
- Helping you, my arse!

285
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,960
So he gets all cocky, telling me
write it all down.

286
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,117
Big deal, go from Constante to Bucharest
in four hours!

287
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,909
I can do it in two hours and a half.

288
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,771
Betty, how long did
it take me on Sunday?

289
00:26:09,783 --> 00:26:11,114
About four hours...

290
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:16,354
- Not the hours and a half?
- Two hours and a half.

291
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,070
- An hour!
- An hour.

292
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,954
That's my girl!

293
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,639
Overtake already, for fuck's sake!

294
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,916
You've got to have a good motor!
In a Dacia you're there in no time.

295
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:38,759
It also depends on the road. It's taking
them forever to widen this road.

296
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,709
Look at the state they left
that motorway in.

297
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,237
- But it's sfill a motorway, right?
- If you can call it that.

298
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,435
For 17 km you fly like the wind!
I did 170 km/h on it in a Dacia.

299
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,953
It hought it was going to break
in two on those slabs.

300
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,870
Obviously it can break in two
if you're doing 170.

301
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,480
If the dial goes to 170,
then that's how fast you have to go.

302
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,836
If not, then why did they put it
on speed dial?

303
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,394
Wher you speeding off to like that?

304
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,276
Make sure you take the first left.

305
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,955
Get in the right lane, Vali.
You said we'd stop off at my place.

306
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,716
- We will...
- You should have turned left here.

307
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,432
On me way back.

308
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,078
I haven't changed my clothes
in three days...

309
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,291
Shall we turn back to
let Betty get changed?

310
00:27:56,303 --> 00:27:57,303
No.

311
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:02,191
Please, Vali... I just need to change
my dothes. That's all.

312
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,960
- I's not up to me.
- We don't have the time.

313
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,517
- Please...
- Hear what the man says?

314
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,315
You've spent 3 days wearing them.
Wear them until 6, when we come back.

315
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,080
- I promise...
- Yes, 7 more hours...

316
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,994
- Betty!
- What, can't I speak?

317
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,878
Give me a break!

318
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,840
Come on. Peasant,
you've got the horse power!

319
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,762
That guy in the Jeep
keeps flashing us.

320
00:28:32,774 --> 00:28:34,797
Maybe he wants to overtake us.

321
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,515
So? He's got all the space he need!

322
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,158
- Maybe we've sprung a leak.
- What leak? Fuck him!

323
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,873
He's keeps flashin...

324
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,195
We're leaking oil or something...

325
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,839
He doesn't want to overtake.

326
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,680
- Better pull over.
- Come off it!

327
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,515
If the oil's leaking, we'd better
pull over.

328
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,436
Have a little patience.
Maybe he just wants to overtake.

329
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,392
Look, he's overtaking...

330
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:18,109
- What the hell does the fucker want?
- Let's pull over and see what's wrong.

331
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,039
No. Look!

332
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,354
- Vali, I mean it!
- No!

333
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,635
- I don't want to run out of oil.
- I'll pull over when I can.

334
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,077
- Pull over in the first lay-by!
- You're a real numbskull!

335
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,315
- Shit, man, pull over now!
- If you've broken my glasses...

336
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,993
- I didn't break anything...
- Look, there's a lay-by!

337
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,717
You're something else!

338
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,355
Happy noW?
Go and see if there's a leak!

339
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,590
What does this guy want?
I'll show him...

340
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,958
Fuckers!

341
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,879
There's another one!

342
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,759
Drive away, Vali!

343
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,753
- You fucking prick!
- Look out!

344
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,475
Fuck you, dickhead!
Fuck you, you fucker!

345
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,393
I've got fucking glass in my eyes!

346
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,552
Fuck, it hurts!

347
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,669
Broken glass everywhere...
Are you alright, Vali?

348
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,669
Yes... I'm bleeding.
The fuckers!

349
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,749
- Let me see, where?
- My nose... I'm alright.

350
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,840
- How's your leg?
- It hurts like hell!

351
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,390
They're coming after us!

352
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,793
- Who the fuck are these guys?
- How should I knoW?

353
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:55,119
They attack us with a baseball bat...
What did we do to them? Cut them up?

354
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,714
- Fuck all.
- What are you laughing at, you dick?

355
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:04,153
If it hasn't been for me.
We'd be dead, I'm telling you!

356
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:08,230
- They had guns!
- Like îuck did they! They had bats!

357
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,229
One of them had a gun.
I saw the holster.

358
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,360
It was his mobile phone.
How could he have a gun?

359
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:20,629
- Can't you go any faster?
- Want to crash? Let me drive!

360
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,353
- Want me to pull over?
- Cut it out!

361
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:27,155
- Cut it out, Vali!
- Shut up, I'm talking to Ovidiu!

362
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,558
Bugger off!

363
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:43,951
Get a move on!
Stupid Moldavian prick!

364
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,913
- What's wrong with your leg?
- It hurts!

365
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,399
It's nothing!

366
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,511
- It hurts.
- He's alright.

367
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,233
Forget it, Vali! Keep moving!

368
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:04,312
When we took off
we could've crashed...

369
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,396
They're behind us.
Let's stop and do them!

370
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,794
- They've got guns and clubs!
- I'll get them with the pump!

371
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,751
- Forget it! Keep driving!
- Don't give me orders!

372
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,150
We do it my way and whack them!

373
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,033
I don't let anybody clobber me!

374
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,951
- Fuck you!
- Relax! Come on, let me drive!

375
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,831
- What are you doing?
- Move!

376
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,269
Careful...

377
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,874
Hurry, man!

378
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,717
All right. Mike Heineken...

379
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,472
Betty, brush these shards away!
They're pricking me in the arse.

380
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,195
Vali turn that music down.
You're not listening to it anyway.

381
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,152
Hello, Mr. Marcel?

382
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,273
Some guys in a Jeep stopped us
and attacked us with baseball bats.

383
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,796
They smashed a window,
almost broke my leg...

384
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,997
Yes, a red one.

385
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:25,033
They're folloeing us. A red Rover.

386
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:29,115
- Nissan Patrol!
- A Nissan Patrol, I don't know, an SUV.

387
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:34,071
Vali, my partner.

388
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,677
Yeah, I made a mistake...
I though it was better this way.

389
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,995
I admit it, I'm sorry.
I made a mistake.

390
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:53,752
- Faster! They want to overtake us.
- No, it's Betty. His girlfriend.

391
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,353
I told you I made a mistake, Mr Marcel.
What else can I say?

392
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,832
They're trying to kill
us and we're talking

393
00:34:01,844 --> 00:34:03,713
about whether I'm
by myself or not?

394
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:07,033
So, I didn't leave by myself!
What do you want me to do now?

395
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,230
Who are these guys?

396
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,831
How do I get rid of them?

397
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,318
I won't take any chances.
Not true. That wasn't the deal.

398
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,634
I said no! I'll turn around
and go back to Constanta

399
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,958
and if they stop us again, I'll
give them the bag. I'm not joking!

400
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,840
I'm not joking, Mr. Marcel!

401
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:36,594
What do you mean, why?
Risk my neck for 2,000 bucks?

402
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:42,150
I'm not interested!
I'm very calm. I'm turning back!

403
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,439
Yes.

404
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,433
Right. Yes.

405
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,670
He said to keep going and
he'll tell us what to do, later.

406
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,310
What did Ivanov give you to transport?

407
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,394
Spit it out. Ovarian.
Don't you fucking dam up on me!

408
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,032
Ovidiu, what's in the bag?

409
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,674
Give me that bag.

410
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:15,115
- Vali, stop it! Betty, stay here!
- What should I do, Vali?

411
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,600
- What did Ivanov give you?
- Medicine.

412
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,594
Don't tell me he gave
you 2,000 bucks jus

413
00:35:27,606 --> 00:35:29,554
to take a bag of
aspirins to Bucharest!

414
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,350
- What are we carrying? Powder?
- Powder, pills, I don? Know...

415
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,994
He told me who to give it to
and that was all! That was the deal!

416
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,155
I didn't ask any questions...

417
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:46,072
For this kind of dough
you have to toil for two years.

418
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,830
And you didn't pu two and two together?

419
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,153
How did he give you the dough?

420
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:55,318
- Don't worry aboutit!
- What do you mean, don't worry?

421
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:59,035
One thousand now,
another when we get back.

422
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,711
- You think they're drugs?
- Definitely!

423
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:08,077
- Got the balls to open the bag?
- Sure, what the fuck!

424
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,799
Give me bag here.

425
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,389
Meclophenoxate, Prednisone...

426
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,398
- The cover will tear if I open them.
- Kiss my arse!

427
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,237
I mean it! One more Meclophenoxate.

428
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,432
- Yes, Mr. Marcel.
- Phenylbutazone...

429
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,830
- They're behind us.
- Suppositories, it says!

430
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,871
If I can squeeze in between
two big trucks I'll be alright.

431
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,795
- But how do I get rid of them noew.
- And where do you fînd two trucks?

432
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:10,319
Listen to me... I was saying that I
should go to the first police station...

433
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,432
Do what?

434
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,791
After Lehliu? They'll
have done for us by then.

435
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:21,718
There's a turn-off after Lehliu? I don't
know. You mean the Urziceni road?

436
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,915
No... So after Lehliu Station.

437
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,236
Right... I'll try...

438
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,593
Alright... It's dirt track?

439
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:38,351
What do you want me to do? Wreck my van?
I'll just replaced the dampers...

440
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,119
Alright. I'll wait for your call.

441
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,274
There's a country road after Lehliu
Station and they won't see us.

442
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,433
If we leave them behind,
we're off the hook.

443
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,520
- I heard.
- He said to drive in a line of cars.

444
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,473
I heard.
What about the delay?

445
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,479
He'll talk to Doncea.

446
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,394
- Doncea is the guy expecting the bag?
- Yes.

447
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,319
Betty, keep your eyes peeled.

448
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,553
Tell us their every move.

449
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,075
Overtake this guy in the Dacia!

450
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,438
Get your hand off the wheel!

451
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,956
- Stay there!
- They're behind us.

452
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,518
- They're tailgating us.
- Sit down!

453
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:49,029
- Let us in!
- They're way behind!

454
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,913
Sit down in the back!
Come on, please!

455
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,480
Listings! There are still
some shards of glass.

456
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:02,071
Betty, clean it up!
Please.

457
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,957
- Move over!
- Careful, don't cut yourself!

458
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,119
Look at him!

459
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,310
What's wrong with your indicators?

460
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:26,477
- We're all by ourselves...
- Step on it!

461
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,712
They're overtaking us...

462
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,996
They're not after us...

463
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,111
I told you so.

464
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,240
Turn on your warning lights
and let's dean up the broken glass!

465
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,355
We're not stopping.

466
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:57,954
You want the police to ask
about the broken window?

467
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:02,434
- I'll tell them it was a stone.
- And they'll ask you about your load.

468
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,077
I'll tell them I'm empty and
going to Bucharest to buy stock.

469
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,954
And they'll search you and find the bag.

470
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:16,553
Come on. Let's take a break. Clean
up the glass, have a piss... Please!

471
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,554
Alright.

472
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,796
Betty, help me dean up
this broken glass, please!

473
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,918
It's not like we get attacked
with a baseball bat every day!

474
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:40,199
You freak out, start
thinking of the movies...

475
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,282
imagining they're
out to get you,

476
00:42:42,294 --> 00:42:44,633
carrying guns... Isn't
that right, Betty?

477
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,999
They had guns. I'm telling you!
I saw one on his belt...

478
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,993
They didn't have guns.
You watch too much TV.

479
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,431
- Tell her!
- Why, is it so impossible?

480
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,871
Everybody's got guns.
You can buy one if you want to.

481
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,760
Air guns, Betty of Medgidia!

482
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,513
You said you could buy one in the port!

483
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,270
- Ovarian, did they have guns?
- I didn't see any.

484
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,639
As a matter of fact, I didn't have
time to look.

485
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,622
Like you said. It's
enough to freak out,

486
00:43:19,634 --> 00:43:21,430
you startthinking
they're out to get you.

487
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:27,193
You freak out and imagine they're
running you off the road.

488
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,677
That's only in America.

489
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,594
Yes, Mother.

490
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:39,318
We'll get everything on the list.

491
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,117
Right, wafers and lollipops too.

492
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,315
Ma, what the hell! Right, bye!

493
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,879
Not even in America. Know what Adi said
when he got back from the States?

494
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,474
Which Adi?

495
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:02,034
- Laura, his girlfriend's brother.
- Ex-girlfriend.

496
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,032
Which Laura?

497
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,355
That blonde from Lips's party?

498
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:14,193
- The one wearing Turkish jeans?
- Don't tell me you're better dressed.

499
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,395
- You and she were an item?
- Yes. So, Adi's her brother.

500
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,157
- You were saying, Vali?
- I cam remember...

501
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,676
Yes... In the two years
he spent in the States,

502
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,475
he didn't hear a single gunshot
in the big city.

503
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,912
- He was in New York, then?
- No, Las Vegas, LA, somewhere.

504
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,879
Anyway, it's not like that.

505
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,959
Give me 6,000.

506
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,874
Thanks.

507
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:12,599
- I can't believe they let us go...
- You think they're still after us?

508
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,640
How could they be, if they overtook us?

509
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,777
I keep thinking they'll
pull out in front of us.

510
00:45:19,789 --> 00:45:22,109
The hell they will.
They weren't after us.

511
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:24,999
Ivanov...

512
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,029
Yes... I don't know.

513
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:33,876
They overtook us on the main road.
Haven't seen them since.

514
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,354
About 16 km to the Urziceni tum-off.

515
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:47,079
We'll watch our backs. Alright.

516
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,800
He said lo be careful - they'll be
waiting for us further down the road.

517
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,275
I don't think so.

518
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:57,673
That's what I'd do -
come out of the blue with my gun.

519
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,235
They don't know where we're heading.

520
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:05,355
Bingo, Betty! You won a T-shirt!

521
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,995
Do we keep going, or lie low
so you can stick it to them...

522
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,235
- Tell me, man!
- Keep going.

523
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,519
When we get to Lehliu
we'll take the turn-off.

524
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,754
- What do we do?
- We keep going.

525
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,199
Look at him!

526
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,955
The Faclia road was gravelled.

527
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,035
Didn't you see it was gravelled?

528
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,354
- Yeah, cobblestones.
- That's what I said.

529
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,368
And the gravel gets
flattened by the cars.

530
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:47,073
What flattened by the cars?

531
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:51,876
The gravel gets flattened
after it's laid.

532
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:56,352
No, bulldozers are for laying asphalt.

533
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,037
That road wasn't surfaced.

534
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:04,276
What, didn't you hear
the gravel flying around?

535
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:08,469
Yes, and then they spread the gravel.

536
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,356
Yes, and then they roll it in
with the compactor.

537
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:16,599
What compactor?
The cars press it in.

538
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:22,029
What cars, nitwit? The compactor
does it, because it's heavy.

539
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,197
What about the chips?

540
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,673
They just lay them and then
coat them with asphalt.

541
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,758
It's not them. It's a Suzuki.

542
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,157
Look, these are uncoated chippings.

543
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:40,754
- And it gets pressed in by cars!
- By the compactor!

544
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:45,511
- Because if the asphalt hardens...
- As if you went to university!

545
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,196
- I did. What the fuck!
- For two years.

546
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,951
Fuck you! You only did ten grades.

547
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,554
Careful, the
turn-off is coming up.

548
00:48:00,566 --> 00:48:03,314
They're nowhere near.
We'll keep going.

549
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:07,597
Take the turn-off.
They're sure to be waiting further on.

550
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,701
To steal your bag
with Meclophenoxate...

551
00:48:10,713 --> 00:48:12,791
You're sure it's
Meclophenoxate?

552
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:16,676
If they wanted the bag
why didn't they take it the first time?

553
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,957
Or afterwards. On the highway...

554
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,749
Stop revving the motor, you'll flood it.

555
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,959
Like they wanted to steal your bag
and your windscreen wipers...

556
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:34,713
Vali!
Ovidiu, isn't that them behind us?

557
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,919
- Where the fuck did they come from?
- Keep going! Faster!

558
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,753
- Faster!
- This is the best she can do.

559
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,670
- Stop!
- What does he want?

560
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,909
Don't mind him, keep going!

561
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:56,555
- Don't look, keep going!
- Tell me where to turn left.

562
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,353
They're overtaking us again.

563
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,354
Stop looking!

564
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,669
Keep going!

565
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,276
Where could I hide
with those guys behind me?

566
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:20,551
- Step on it!
- Want to take my place?

567
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,319
- Let me drive then.
- I can't see any turn-off...

568
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,111
Really! Get out of the way, woman!

569
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,152
- Now they've nabbed us for speeding.
- Where?

570
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,237
That white Dacia.

571
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:45,909
Easy.

572
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:51,017
I can't be bothered
to wrangle with them.

573
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:52,713
I know what to say to them.

574
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,288
We've got money. We'll
pay and that's that!

575
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,319
Yes, alright. They've
stopped our guys too.

576
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,672
- Documents and registration, please.
- Registration.

577
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,829
- And your driving license?
- I left it at home.

578
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,668
Have another look...

579
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:13,189
No. I'm sure I left
it in my jeans pocket.

580
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:18,629
- So, you don't have a license?
- Yes. I do! You can check.

581
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:22,953
- Your ID.
- Betty, look in my jacket.

582
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:26,671
- Perhaps the little girl has it...
- No. I'm positive it's at home.

583
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,832
But you can check over the radio.

584
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:34,398
- Blood type?
- It's not there.

585
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,517
That will make the fine bigger.

586
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,998
So you were travelling at 60 km/h
in a built-up area.

587
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:46,076
- We can send you the photo as proof.
- No need, I believe you.

588
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,075
- Where are you headed?
- Bucharest.

589
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,033
- Is this your vehicle?
- No, it's a company vehicle.

590
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,438
- Where is the license registered?
- In Constanta.

591
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:04,229
Check this license, please.
Valentin Patranescu, Constanta.

592
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:08,394
ID number: BG 080326. I repeat...

593
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,875
- What's the rush?
- So we can get back home early.

594
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,757
Stuff is cheaper in Bucharest.

595
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:20,315
Do you know the fine
for not having your license on you?

596
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:22,318
20000.

597
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,237
The law imposes a
fine of 600.000 to

598
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:28,471
900,000. 300.000 if you
pay within 48 hours.

599
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,752
I think you should keep looking...

600
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,995
You'll have 50,000
more to pay within 48

601
00:51:36,007 --> 00:51:39,076
hours' for speeding in
a residential area.

602
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:43,194
- I don't have it on me.
- Keep looking. I'll wait.

603
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,794
I told you not to argue.

604
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:52,231
If I give him the license,
he'll confiscate it.

605
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:58,389
- Do you have it on you?
- Yes, but I'm not showing it!

606
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,959
Better to give him 100000
than have him suspend it.

607
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:07,350
Go grease his palm
and let's get out of here.

608
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:11,359
Give me 100.000..
No. 50,000. That'll do.

609
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:12,880
I'll go.

610
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,114
Let me drive.

611
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:51,276
- What are you doing?
- We're taking Ivanov's route.

612
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,119
Why this way?

613
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,711
Mind we don't get stuck...

614
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:02,270
- Don't you worry!
- How do we get back?

615
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,278
The road is back this way.

616
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,396
- You bribed him?
- Yes.

617
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:20,553
- How much?
- 250,000.

618
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:25,952
What the fuck! You patsy!
Make Ivanov refund it.

619
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,957
Turn left...

620
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:37,519
Past that cart.

621
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,758
Yes, you think?

622
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,072
That's it, good.

623
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,913
There's the water tower.

624
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,838
At first there's asphalt'
then it's a dirt track.

625
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,350
Goodbye, asphalt! That's it!

626
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:07,400
Go too fast down here at night
and you're a goner!

627
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,715
This road is only fit for an SUV.

628
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,116
An SUV is good on any road.

629
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,638
Good speed on asphalt.
4-wheel drive for the potholes...

630
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,995
This is a road for an
all-terrain vehicle.

631
00:54:26,007 --> 00:54:27,754
Not to mention the suspension...

632
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:33,957
The suspension is shitty... I mean
it's rigid, shakes you to jelly.

633
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:40,230
There are all kinds of SUVs.
Town SUVs, off-road SUVs...

634
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:46,636
The best are those with good suspension.

635
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,270
A Rover's the car. Baby!

636
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:56,079
We were lucky the police pulled us over.
Otherwise those guys would have got us.

637
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,675
All in all, we were lucky.

638
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,197
What's this, another cop?

639
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,879
Look, another one.

640
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,078
He's feeling hot...

641
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,035
He's taken the wife out for a picnic...

642
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:22,871
- No way, it's a hooker.
- Don't bother them, then.

643
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:31,118
These potholes!
I told Ivanov I'd wreck my axle...

644
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:38,470
- That asphalt looks like heaven...
- Wait, there's a truck coming.

645
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:44,159
Geez!

646
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,160
Geez!

647
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,397
At last!

648
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,916
- We're back in business!
- Welcome back to civilization!

649
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,396
I can't believe it's ten past two.

650
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:08,634
What with the coppers,
what with crawling along that lane...

651
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,192
Anyway, Doncea knows we'll be late.

652
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:18,680
How are you enjoying the trip, Betty?
Ever coming with us to Bucharest again?

653
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:21,880
- Aren't you thirsty?
- Let's get a Coke.

654
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,954
I'm kind of hungry.

655
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:29,749
While I fill up, you go buy some grub.

656
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,511
There's a shop not far from Dorally.

657
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,714
Dollary...

658
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,918
Yes, we'll stop at the petrol station.

659
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,556
They've only got oil...

660
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,957
They've got to have something...

661
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:53,677
Just motor oil, can't you see?

662
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:12,357
- Are you buying anything?
- What, oil?

663
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,280
- Maybe they've got other stuff...
- They haven't got anything.

664
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:20,156
- 300,000 lei's worth of petrol.
- Betty, want a Coke?

665
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,636
- Want anything?
- Me? Nothing.

666
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:26,316
- I'll get you litre of oil.
- Nothing, thanks!

667
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:29,718
Betty, Coke or Fanta?
Ovidiu, the SUV!

668
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,159
It's the same make...

669
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:50,990
- Don't wash it!
- Leave the little fucker alone!

670
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,474
Go away!

671
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:58,755
Get lost!

672
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:01,629
- The cigarette!
- Sorry!

673
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,024
This is a petrol station!
You can't smoke here!

674
00:58:04,036 --> 00:58:05,310
What the fuck do you want?

675
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,756
- Watch your language!
- I'm watching my language.

676
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:11,792
What the fuck do you want?
Tell me!

677
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,469
- Vali!
- Get in the car.

678
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,517
Come and get your money!

679
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:32,231
Don't mind him, he's upset!

680
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:39,792
- You didn't need have a go at him.
- Fuck them!

681
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:43,399
That little urchin pissed me off, too.

682
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,358
- Why did the other one butt in?
- He told me to put out my cigarette.

683
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:57,080
I don't want to have
anything more to do with Ivanov.

684
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:00,789
We unload the stuff and off we go.

685
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,640
You were shitting yourself
when you saw that SUV.

686
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,749
Easy...

687
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:20,429
Man, these Bucharest drivers!

688
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:23,069
- No signal. Nothing...
- Did you see that one?

689
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:25,839
What about this one!

690
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:29,358
Keep looking in the wing mirror'
I almost sideswiped that car...

691
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:32,385
They're too small,
those Tico cars...

692
00:59:32,397 --> 00:59:34,989
Look in the wing
mirror for me, will you.

693
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,275
The light's red!

694
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:51,794
Is it much farther?

695
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:56,319
I think it's on the right.

696
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,477
- First right?
- Yes.

697
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:04,073
Let me ask someone...

698
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:07,634
- What street?
- Agricultori.

699
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:11,474
Excuse me! Agricultori?

700
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,479
Thanks a lot.

701
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,559
I think it's on the left.

702
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,959
- Look, this is it!
- Yes, Agricultori.

703
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,796
This side or the other?

704
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,958
I think it's the same. Try left.

705
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:40,957
Yes, man. Agricultori!

706
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:50,393
Let's see if we can get past
all these cars...

707
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:53,953
You've got room.

708
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,309
16 you said? This is 65.

709
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:06,318
- 16?
- Yes.

710
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:11,190
16?

711
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,794
80! I think it's the other way!

712
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,870
Past the intersection...

713
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:21,229
Look!

714
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:50,274
This is it.

715
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:05,153
Turn the engine off.

716
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,032
Nobody's home.

717
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:23,717
He knew we were coming.

718
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:30,918
- I don't think the bell is working.
- We'll knock on the gate.

719
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:36,159
There's nobody here...

720
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,432
He knew we were coming.

721
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:41,273
He must have popped out.

722
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:44,754
- What's the time?
- Ten to three.

723
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:49,036
He'll be back at half past three max.

724
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:52,314
He knew we'd be late
and he went out to get some stuff.

725
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:56,110
- What do we do?
- We wait, what else?

726
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:00,919
Stop knocking!

727
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:42,270
We're waiting here like a couple
of idiots! Let's do the shopping.

728
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:50,039
- No!
- Come on, please!

729
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:53,919
We could be waiting for ages...

730
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:57,680
We deliver the goods
and then we do the shopping.

731
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:01,238
My arse has gone numb.

732
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:03,633
Take a walk!

733
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:11,440
How about I take the van
and go with Betty to do the shopping.

734
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:14,758
- And you wait here for Doncea.
- What about the bag?

735
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:16,719
You hang on to it.

736
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:23,234
No. We'll wait a bit longer.
He won't be much longer.

737
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,072
It was just an idea.

738
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:30,318
- What's the time?
- Five past three.

739
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:33,351
Let's go! Fuck Doncea!

740
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:25,869
- One of us has to stay in the van.
- Why?

741
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:31,156
- I don't want it to get broken into.
- Who would break into this jalopy?

742
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:34,094
I don't want to have
to worry about it!

743
01:05:34,106 --> 01:05:35,394
I'll stay behind.

744
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,557
Let her stay behind.

745
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:41,831
- I wanted to see those sandals...
- Not now.

746
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:46,233
- Go, I'll slay.
- I can't carry all the stuff with her!

747
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:51,799
Alright, I'll stay... Big shots...

748
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:55,519
- Betty, listen here.
- Get me a croissant! I'm hungry.

749
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:59,354
Look after the bag.
Don't get out of the van!

750
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,831
What did your mother say? Oil?

751
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:36,312
- Coke, beer, alcohol, mineral water.
- It's stupid to buy beer here.

752
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:40,590
Let's not buy beer then. Get the rest...

753
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:44,393
- Got any oil in glass bottles?
- Plastic bottles.

754
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:48,438
- How many in a case?
- 12.

755
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:52,397
- How much is a bottle?
- 12,000.

756
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:58,433
- 12 times 12... 320...
- Bollocks! 240 something...

757
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,719
We'll take four of these.

758
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:04,072
- Got any beer in cans?
- Yes.

759
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:06,157
- Alcohol free?
- With alcohol...

760
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:07,953
We're not getting beer.

761
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:19,672
Puffed wheat!
I haven't eaten that stuff for ages!

762
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:23,033
- We have to buy Cola and pretzels.
- And something to eat.

763
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:27,476
- Bananas - full of protein.
- You eat bananas, if you like!

764
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:32,073
- They've got croissants here...
- Buy one for Betty and for yourself.

765
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:34,630
- How much is the Coke here?
- 13,900.

766
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:41,595
- We have to buy 10 cases.
- It's cheaper at the fat bloke's.

767
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:44,396
Why is it so expensive here?

768
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:48,110
It's 1,000 cheaper down there.

769
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,674
Wait, I don't get it.
Why is it so expensive here?

770
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:57,845
I wonder if Doncea is back?
I'll call...

771
01:07:57,857 --> 01:07:59,272
Ten cases of Cola.

772
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:04,594
I left my mobile phone in the car.
Damn it!

773
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,791
- Oil... Do we get any spirit?
- Yes.

774
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,196
- How many cases of oil?
- 4.

775
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,477
Hurry up, will you!

776
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:15,516
Fuck Doncea! Let him wait!

777
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,710
- How many cases?
- 16...

778
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:22,516
It'll take too long by the time
you get the invoice and pay!

779
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:26,031
- I'm going back to the van.
- Wait, I'm coming with you.

780
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:28,277
I have to call that guy.

781
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:32,552
What's the time?
It's late, fuck it, I'm going.

782
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:36,755
Give him the oil now.
I'll stay behind and pay.

783
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:40,639
- Four cases?
- No, two.

784
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:46,790
It's OK.

785
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:49,836
- Here's the list.
- You want a trolley?

786
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:52,390
- Yes.
- Take the money.

787
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:59,355
- Anything else?
- I told you...

788
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:03,949
Coke, alcohol, cooking oil water...
That's all. And the trolley.

789
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:07,518
- The trolley...
- And the invoice.

790
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:11,590
Didn't I tell you not to leave the van?

791
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:16,313
- What have you got shit for brains?
- And so do you!

792
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:21,313
- You went to get a fucking ice cream!
- Big deal!

793
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:25,036
That's right! In two minutes flat
they'd have cleaned out the van.

794
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:27,833
Fuck!

795
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:31,350
What's the matter?
What are you het up about?

796
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:34,951
The clever girl left the van unlocked
and went to buy ice cream.

797
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:37,876
- Did they take the bag?
- No.

798
01:09:39,720 --> 01:09:41,631
You left the van unlocked?

799
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:45,078
- Yes, but nothing happened.
- So what?

800
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:49,319
You were supposed to keep an eye
on the van, not buy ice cream!

801
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:55,155
I ask her why she left it.
And she says nobody broke in.

802
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:56,960
Leave her be, man!

803
01:09:56,972 --> 01:09:59,351
You knew why I left you behind.
Didn't you?

804
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:03,036
Answer me!
Don't make eyes at him!

805
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,035
To look after the bag.

806
01:10:06,047 --> 01:10:08,997
And you go buy
yourself an ice cream...

807
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:13,309
How could you do that! Fuck it!

808
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:17,437
What's this? Want to strangle her?

809
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:20,030
You've been rubbing me up the wrong way
all day, arsehole!

810
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:22,151
Oh yeah? You watch your mouth.

811
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:25,155
Don't you realise
they could've taken everything?

812
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:28,242
Man, I told her to stay
rooted to the spot.

813
01:10:28,254 --> 01:10:29,795
Didn't I? Stop staring. You cow!

814
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:34,149
- That's enough, man, enough!
- What?

815
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:38,634
Enough!

816
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:41,689
I'll get the train
back to Constanta.

817
01:10:41,701 --> 01:10:43,357
Get the fucking train
back to Constanta!

818
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:48,869
"You should be ashamed of youself.
Man, aren't we in the same shit?"

819
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:55,670
Why should I be ashamed of myself?
Tell me!

820
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:02,110
- Why?
- Leave me fucking me alone.

821
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:06,200
Ashamed of your big boss attitude.
You're full of shit.

822
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:09,474
So why are you hanging outwith me?

823
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:14,830
So now it's every man for himself?

824
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:18,034
- It's like you say...
- I say fuck!

825
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:21,519
Take your big boss bag
and shove it up your arse!

826
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,330
I'm looking for Mr. Doncea.
From Constanta.

827
01:12:11,342 --> 01:12:12,634
He's busy. Tell me.

828
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,435
Tell him on behalf of Mr. Ivanov.

829
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,154
Come on in!

830
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:24,674
Shut the gate!

831
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,872
- Sit with that lad over there!
- Hello!

832
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:49,515
- Do what?
- Sit with that lad over there!

833
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:22,870
- You're Ovidiu, are you?
- Yes.

834
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,554
Hand it over.

835
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:29,672
The bag, give it here!

836
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:39,197
Those guys on the road
left you be, did they?

837
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:43,675
And? I've been waiting since two.

838
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:46,237
There was nobody here at three.

839
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:49,599
Give me the mobile!

840
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:57,758
I was expecting 14 packages.
There are only 6 here.

841
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,119
I don't know anything about that.

842
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:08,071
There're B packages missing...
Hi, Mr. Marcel!

843
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,630
Yes, he's here...
No, no problem.

844
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:15,676
We'd agreed on 14 packages.

845
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:23,951
Yes, right... I got a fright.
Whatever you say, yes...

846
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:29,796
Mr. Marcel, if you need anything,
you know where to find me.

847
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:33,115
One moment.

848
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:41,193
Yes, Mr. Marcel.

849
01:14:42,040 --> 01:14:45,078
Tired... Yes. That was after Lehliu.

850
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:50,928
Lucky in a way that the
police stopped us.

851
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:52,240
And them too.

852
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:57,357
Yes, thank you.

853
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:00,554
It would have been good
If it'd been like that all the way.

854
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,240
Bye.

855
01:15:06,520 --> 01:15:07,794
Gabi!

856
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:11,954
Come on.

857
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:16,830
Put this in my office!

858
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:28,954
That's all.

859
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:35,670
Bye!

860
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:42,114
Bye!

861
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:47,200
- Where's my denim jacket?
- I don't know...

862
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:50,512
He put the stuff on top of it.

863
01:15:51,720 --> 01:15:53,597
Does your leg still hurt?

864
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:47,475
Shall we take the same route back?

865
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:50,917
Take whatever route you like.

866
01:16:57,680 --> 01:16:59,751
I'll go the same way.

867
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,516
When we get back
are you coming over to my place?

868
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:11,032
My motherwill make us something to eat.
We'll have a couple of beers...

869
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:15,397
- What do you say?
- I'm not hungry.

870
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:18,999
I'm not hungry.

871
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:25,432
Why the long face? We're partners'
the money's fifty-fifty.

872
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:28,478
I'll be going to bed.

873
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:31,952
I'll put some music on, eh?

874
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:38,118
- Anything special?
- Whatever!

875
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:45,077
There's been an accident.

876
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:51,518
- Shall we go and have a look?
- I'm not interested!

877
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:00,429
I think it's the SUV...

878
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:12,549
- You coming?
- Leave me alone!

879
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:39,956
- What happened?
- I don't know.

880
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:42,715
I've never seen anything like it.
They're all dead.

881
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:45,196
Make sure that yellow car
doesn't leave.

882
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:12,991
What happened there, sergeant?

883
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:23,079
Clear the perimeter, please!

884
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:25,157
Stand back! Stand well back!

885
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:28,471
Please stand back.

886
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:22,070
Fallen asleep in there?
Get moving!

887
01:20:54,360 --> 01:20:57,557
You left without the cases of beer...

888
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:02,629
It's alright, I can manage.

889
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:09,552
Bring them upfront, not here.

890
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:23,478
Good evening, Mr. Ovidiu!

891
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,195
There've been customers
asking for beer all day

892
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:35,598
and there wasn't any to give them.

893
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:39,718
- Hello!
- Hi, son.

894
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:43,999
- Did you buy what I asked you?
- Yes, everything.

895
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:47,990
- There are some people waiting for you.
- I know.

896
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:51,434
- Mr. Marcel's here too.
- Good evening, Mr. Ovidiu!

897
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:55,076
You've got cockroaches
in the bathroom, too.

898
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:58,512
I'll send a man around
with some insecticide.

899
01:21:59,880 --> 01:22:02,174
We've got things to discuss.
Mrs Caty.

900
01:22:02,186 --> 01:22:04,670
Business. Invoices,
that kind of thing...

901
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:07,514
Good evening.

902
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:11,160
- There's more stuff in the van.
- Never mind the stuff. We need to talk.

903
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:13,710
Come in, get in line. Lads.
We have to talk.

904
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:23,039
Mr. Mitica!

905
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:30,113
Never mind the shop.
There are no customers at this hour.

906
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:35,433
Go into the kitchen. Have some coffee...
Relax. Feel at home.

907
01:22:35,640 --> 01:22:37,517
Would you like a beer or anything?

908
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:57,598
Miss Nina, Mr. Sotir Erdogan.
My associates...

909
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,591
Ovidiu. The transport man...

910
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:04,799
Beatrice, Vali.

911
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:08,224
Let's start. Ovidiu,
you delivered the bag?

912
01:23:08,236 --> 01:23:09,236
Yes.

913
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:12,034
Good. I said one grand before,
one grand after.

914
01:23:12,720 --> 01:23:14,916
I've already given you one grand.
Erdogan!

915
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:17,631
Another grand now
and I'm done with you.

916
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:20,549
We don't count Beatrice... Vali!

917
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:24,469
You talk to your partner Ovidiu.
How you split it is your business.

918
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:27,835
Here!

919
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:38,440
Turk? Are those three really dead' or
will they turn up at my door tomorrow?

920
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:40,517
Yes, right, at your door tomorrow!

921
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:47,473
Good! Ovidiu, hows the leg?

922
01:23:48,200 --> 01:23:49,634
It's fine now.

923
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:53,155
Vali, how was the trip?

924
01:23:55,040 --> 01:23:58,032
The police pulled us over.
The guys in the SUV...

925
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:01,873
- But we got away. We're smart lads.
- Have you got a car?

926
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:05,198
- The white Dacia in front.
- A Dacia will do just fine...

927
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:08,155
- What's the mileage?
- Not more than 100,000 km.

928
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:12,118
Tomorrow you'll receive some packages
for Mr. Doncea.

929
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:14,296
You know the address.
You don't take Beatrice with you.

930
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:16,550
Drop them off, come back
and pick up your money!

931
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:19,359
That's about all!

932
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:24,352
Mr Ivanov, Vali and I don't want
to make any more deliveries like this.

933
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:30,350
What are you saying?
Secrets between friends?

934
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:33,154
Say it out loud for these people
to hear, too!

935
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:37,039
Come here...

936
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:44,519
Don't cross me! Or else
I'll send you your

937
01:24:44,531 --> 01:24:46,554
folks and your fucking
stall to kingdom come!

938
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:03,758
What the fuck...

939
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:10,515
Come on, let's show Erdogan
where to find you in the morning.

940
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:13,073
I'll give you a lift.

941
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:21,076
Mr. Mitica, the coast is dear!

942
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:25,397
Shall I send the man
to do the bathroom tomorrow?

943
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:28,638
- I don't know... It might be expensive.
- It won't cost you anything.

944
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:31,073
I'll call you when I get home.

945
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:34,315
- Alright.
- Enough already!

946
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:38,597
Cut out the confession. Lads!
We're off!

947
01:25:41,480 --> 01:25:43,790
- Have a good evening.
- Bye-bye!

948
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:11,595
- Are you hungry? Want to eat?
- Yes.

949
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:16,156
There's salad and chips.
I'll put them out for you.

950
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:30,673
The guy with the stall called.

951
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:34,632
He said to call him tomorrow
before ten.

952
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:38,751
- Bread?
- No thanks.

953
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:41,120
Alright.

954
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:44,390
If you want more, help yourself.

955
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:48,477
I'm going to bed. I'm knackered.

956
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:52,798
- How was the trip? Was it hot?
- So-so...

957
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:57,550
It was sweltering here...
That must be why I'm so tired.

958
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:01,710
- I'm going to bed. Good night!
- Good night.
