<i>Episode 49</i>

3
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,780
The patient was involved in a motor vehicle accident.

4
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:18,380
<i>He is unconscious, and sustained severe trauma to his head and chest.</i>

5
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:25,270
<i>Defibrillator!</i>

6
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,070
I can't get in touch with you.

7
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:31,100
I... am at the airport right now.

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,070
Call me as soon as you get this message.

9
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,000
<i>Shock!</i>

10
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,970
Where have you been with your cell phone turned off?

11
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,040
I was worried about you.

12
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,470
I met with Chae Won.

13
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,070
What for?

14
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,760
I met with her, and

15
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,570
gave her a plane ticket.

16
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:09,660
Plane ticket?

17
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,090
Yes.

18
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,870
By now,

19
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:16,280
they will be sitting side by side on the plane.

20
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,860
Seriously, why are you doing this?

21
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,740
What are thinking by doing all of this?

22
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,920
I had to do this.

23
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,080
I did it because I feel bad for Se Yoon and Choon Hee.

24
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,120
I'm protecting the last bit of conscience I have left.

25
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,070
I feel bad for Chae Won and Choon Hee too, but

26
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:39,300
all it's not going to get fixed by doing this.

27
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,410
Right now you are

28
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:45,010
just making it worse.

29
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,900
Let's...

30
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,020
get a divorce.

31
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,450
What?

32
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,270
I did this with

33
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,850
the worst case in my mind.

34
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,510
Without any conditions,

35
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,420
I'll just do as you wish.

36
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,820
Hello.

37
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,520
<i>Is this Lee Se Yoon's residence?</i>

38
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,920
Yes, that is right.

39
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,690
Who is this?

40
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,400
<i>This is the Emergency Department of Sae Han Hospital.</i>

41
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,740
Emergency room?

42
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,520
Why isn't he picking up the phone?

43
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:41,340
Excuse me.

44
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,950
Yes, what can I help you with?

45
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:45,950
There is a person I'm supposed to be catching a plane with, but that person isn't picking up the phone.

46
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:47,950
Can you check the passenger list?

47
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:52,940
I'm sorry, I can't do that due to the Personal Information Protection Act.

48
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:55,780
I see.

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,100
<i> Se Yoon's Mom </i>

50
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,340
Yes, Mother.

51
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:06,490
I'm at the departure gate right now, but we didn't meet yet because I couldn't get in touch with Se Yoon.

52
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,750
What?

53
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,170
Emergency room?

54
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:14,470
Doctor! Doctor. Doctor.

55
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,920
Our Se Yoon... What happened to our Se Yoon?

56
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,730
He had a cardiac arrest when he arrived to the emergency room.

57
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,950
After receiving immediate treatment, heart function has been restored.

58
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,720
How in the world...?

59
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,150
Then, is he alright now?

60
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:35,170
Due to trauma from the car accident, his blood vessels ruptured, and blood has accumulated in the subdural space.

61
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:40,170
If he doesn't get the blood clot removed surgically, then it could kill him.

62
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,710
Then, can he recover if he gets the surgery?

63
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:47,780
The outcome is poor if it's an acute subdural hemorrhage.

64
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:50,140
Though it varies.

65
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,100
Even with surgical interventions, 60% of patients could die.

66
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:56,370
Honey!

67
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,520
No... It can't happen...

68
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,160
That can't be Doctor, it can't.

69
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,950
Please save our Se Yoon.

70
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,760
It can't, I beg you doctor.

71
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,740
I'll do my best.

72
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,970
Mother!

73
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,320
What about Se Yoon?

74
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,410
Surgery...right now...

75
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,120
Surgery...started...

76
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,670
I'm sorry...

77
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:44,040
I should have gone to you a little earlier, Se Yoon.

78
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,610
Give me another chance...

79
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:51,590
One more, please Se Yoon.

80
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,890
Please speed up more.

81
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:15,850
Hurry.

82
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,020
Let's go there fast.

83
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,800
I'm going as fast as I can.

84
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,870
I'm sorry, Se Yoon.

85
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,690
I'm being a burden to you to the end.

86
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,550
It's all my fault.

87
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,960
If I hadn't called him,

88
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,320
this accident wouldn't have happened.

89
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,700
Why did I do something that I wasn't even told?

90
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,810
It's not your fault, so

91
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,300
don't blame yourself. It's not your fault.

92
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,320
Wait for me, Se Yoon.

93
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,000
Mom is on her way, wait..

94
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,590
Chae Won!

95
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,780
Mom.

96
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,090
Se Yoon. What about Se Yoon?

97
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,470
He is in surgery right now.

98
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,560
What did the Doctor say?

99
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,810
Will he be fine after the surgery?

100
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,520
He'll be alright, right Unni?

101
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:30,380
If he just receives the surgery, he'll be fine. Right Brother-in-law?

102
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,360
Choon Hee.

103
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,750
What is it?

104
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,810
Is it very serious?

105
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:42,980
All he needs is the surgery, right?

106
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,660
We arrived at your house safely, sir.

107
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,650
Yes, you've worked very hard.

108
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,040
The world is quite small.

109
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,770
You and I used to be neighbors.

110
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:12,660
Until recently, I lived in this neighborhood.

111
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,520
My house was right next to yours.

112
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,630
You're lying too much.

113
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:23,190
Why would someone who used to live in this neighborhood be a substitute driver?

114
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,600
Yes, well I...

115
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,710
because of personal reasons it just turned out that way.

116
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,510
You've worked hard.

117
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:33,080
Yes, please go inside.

118
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,740
My bedroom is lit up brightly.

119
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,300
Did someone move in already?

120
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,290
Coco!

121
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:27,230
Mom is having a hard time so stay still.

122
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,320
Agashi.

123
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,840
Mrs. Park!

124
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,440
Welcome back, Agashi.

125
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,530
You're not even alone. You had a hard time, right?

126
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,830
Do you know what a good baby this is in my womb?

127
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:44,600
As soon as I got on the plane, I slept soundly.

128
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,160
When did you come, Mrs. Park?

129
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,140
I came a while ago. I cleaned the house,

130
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,770
went to the market, and made kimchi.

131
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:54,580
I missed your kimchi so much Mrs. Park.

132
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,230
This is great.

133
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:00,470
How is your Mom?

134
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:02,030
She's better.

135
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,820
She can sleep without sleeping medicine.

136
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,200
And she laughs once in a while.

137
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,790
That is a relief.

138
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,070
I'm hungry.

139
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:10,410
Aigoo, look at me.

140
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:13,170
Let's go inside, quickly.

141
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,950
Coco.

142
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,700
Something bad can happen!

143
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,580
What would happen if you take so many pills at once?

144
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,340
I'm so burning up inside! What should I do then?!

145
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,880
Something bad can happen, Mom!

146
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,520
Death is the worst thing that can happen.

147
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,070
Leave me alone.

148
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:55,080
Why are you suddenly crying?

149
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,450
When you say things like that, my heart feels like it will burst.

150
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,160
If it wasn't for me, you and Oppa wouldn't have gone through all this.

151
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,220
I really want to die.

152
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,230
I understand, Joo Ri.

153
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,850
I won't get angry in the future. Don't cry.

154
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,530
Don't cry, Joo Ri.

155
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,240
I'm back.

156
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,880
Where have you been all day that you're coming back just now?

157
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,110
I started my job as a replacement driver.

158
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:26,810
What?

159
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:31,530
Until I find a suitable job, I think of this as an experience in life.

160
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,760
Aigoo, aigoo.

161
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,640
Aigoo.

162
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,010
Aiyoo...

163
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:40,060
My precious child...

164
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:44,650
How did he end up like this?

165
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,680
Since I have committed so many sins,

166
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,970
I'm paying for them now.

167
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:59,170
Mom, really, why are you taking it so seriously?

168
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:02,350
I told you I'm just doing it for the experience.

169
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,060
I'm really good.

170
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:09,160
Aigoo, how did I raise you?

171
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,120
How in the world could something like this happen?

172
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,260
What am I supposed to do?

173
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,950
Why is Mom overly sensitive today?

174
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:24,350
Ok, ok! Dry you tears.

175
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:28,700
I bought chicken, so eat it up.

176
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:33,760
Here.

177
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,970
Mom, here.

178
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,850
Aigoo! It's fine.

179
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:39,200
Right now, do you think

180
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,250
I'm in a mood to tear up a chicken leg?

181
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,130
Aigoo Mom! Really, this

182
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,260
won't taste good if it gets cold. Hurry!

183
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,370
I bought you the kind that you like, fried.

184
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:51,740
Is it warm?

185
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,930
Of course, it's warm.

186
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:04,490
Why are you guys being like this in front of food?

187
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:07,960
If someone were to hear you, they would think we were killing a chicken.

188
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,800
Se Yoon...

189
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,730
Open your eyes.

190
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:38,380
Mom is here.

191
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:44,550
Chae Won... Chae Won is here, too.

192
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:49,080
Se Yoon, wake up, please!

193
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:55,360
Doctor, how come he's not waking up?

194
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,860
By any chance, did something go wrong with the surgery?

195
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:02,750
As you heard from Dr. Kim, the surgery was successful.

196
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,000
However...

197
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,980
What do you mean?

198
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,600
Since trauma to the brain was severe,

199
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,040
we don't know what will happen after the surgery. We'll have to monitor further.

200
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:18,080
There could be other complications.

201
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:23,500
What do you mean "other complications"? Perhaps, he'll never regain consciousness?

202
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:26,510
Unfortunately, there is a high probability that may happen.

203
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,130
<i>That can't happen, Doctor.</i>

204
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:30,950
Absolutely something like that cannot happen, Doctor!

205
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:34,760
We cannot let that happen, Doctor. Please make our son wake up!

206
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,900
Please!

207
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:47,040
Se Yoon...

208
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,080
Se Yoon...

209
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,050
Se Yoon, try to open your eyes.

210
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:56,520
Your mom is here, Se Yoon.

211
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,100
Se Yoon, open your eyes...

212
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,060
Please...

213
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,350
<i>Se Yoon...</i>

214
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,330
Don't worry too much, Choon Hee.

215
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:41,250
Our Se Yoon will wake up soon.

216
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:45,270
After the anesthesia wears off, and he sleeps the night,

217
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,600
he'll wake up

218
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,350
as if nothing happened.

219
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:54,400
I should not have come back.

220
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:58,110
If it weren't for me,

221
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:02,250
our children wouldn't have such a difficult time.

222
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,930
Our Se Yoon wouldn't have to leave for the States.

223
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:10,210
And, he wouldn't have been in the car accident.

224
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:13,270
What are you saying?

225
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:17,290
When you think about it, it's all my fault.

226
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:21,310
Only if I didn't steal our Se Yoon

227
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:24,730
from the maternity ward that day...

228
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:28,990
My greed and sins

229
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:33,160
have led to today's tragedy.

230
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,520
I should have been the one to get punished...

231
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,960
Why our Se Yoon...?

232
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,070
<i>If you don't want me to go, I won't go.</i>

233
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:14,260
<i>If you don't want me to go to the U.S. branch, then I won't.</i>

234
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,860
<i>I am sorry.</i>

235
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,320
<i>Be healthy,</i>

236
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,620
<i>and stay well.</i>

237
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,850
I'm sorry.

238
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:39,880
Only if I wasn't stubborn to the end,

239
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,300
this wouldn't have happened.

240
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,370
I am too ashamed to see you.

241
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:49,490
Nothing bad will happen.

242
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,990
After he sleeps well tonight,

243
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:59,230
he will wake up tomorrow morning.

244
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:01,530
Ok.

245
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,230
He should.

246
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:24,260
<i> Seriously, how many first loves do you have, Oppa?</i>

247
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:28,030
<i>Didn't I tell you that all love is first love?</i>

248
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,930
<i>So,</i>

249
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:34,090
<i>to propose to your first love from your 30's,</i>

250
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:36,790
<i>we went to look at the rings,</i>

251
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:42,590
<i>and you sang in front of me to practice. Is that what happened?</i>

252
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:46,640
<i>Thanks, Kang Sook. You helped a lot.</i>

253
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,580
This is so embarrassing. So embarrassing...

254
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:53,830
What kind of embarrassment is this?

255
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,190
You wife, what did you do well that you are drinking?

256
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,390
Why am I your wife?

257
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,860
How am I your wife?

258
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,120
Look at you...

259
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,930
How could you yell at me when you are the one who's done wrong?

260
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:19,700
I haven't done anything good, but I haven't don't anything wrong either!

261
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,840
You haven't done anything wrong?

262
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,940
You fooled around with that gigolo guy behind my back.

263
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,780
And you still haven't done anything wrong?

264
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,770
Tell me honestly.

265
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:37,420
If that gigolo had proposed to you, you would have said ok, right?

266
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,960
No, it's not like that.

267
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,580
What do you mean, "it's not like that?"

268
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:46,370
You were so into him that Bo Reum, and I were nothing to you.

269
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,270
Look, you can't even answer me.

270
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:54,650
Even though we have stamped the divorce paper, as a human being, you shouldn't act that way.

271
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:57,590
You have to have a conscience.

272
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:05,950
Truthfully, we were happy.

273
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:09,700
Because living was hard,

274
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:16,160
my heart grew cold.

275
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:21,350
Since Oppa said I was pretty, he was attentive,

276
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:26,950
I felt my heart softened.

277
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,280
I only got treated as a wife by you.

278
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:38,550
It's been a while since I was treated as a woman. I was happy.

279
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:44,180
I thought if I could only spend one day with someone like him and die, I'd have no regrets.

280
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:46,980
It wouldn't be enough if you begged on your hands and knees.

281
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,230
What are you saying right now?

282
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:54,290
Why should I beg you? I have not done anything wrong to you.

283
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:00,690
Bo Reum's mom! Kang Sook!

284
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:11,420
I'm curious about something.

285
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,040
About what?

286
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:18,910
How did you find out about me meeting with Oppa, and started to follow me?

287
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:21,480
Did Aghassi tell you?

288
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,060
No, that's not what happened.

289
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:29,590
The day you got your flower present...

290
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:34,560
You sent the text to me in error that was meant for that gigolo.

291
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,980
After that, I became suspicious, and started to follow you.

292
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,640
They say you can only steal if you're used to it.

293
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,030
Gong Kang Sook, you're really pathetic.

294
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:54,020
But, why did you act like if you didn't know anything?

295
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:02,990
Unlike someone else, I don't have anything, and I'm not educated.

296
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:06,500
How could I hold on to you?

297
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:11,910
If you met a nice guy, I should just wish you happiness.

298
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:14,400
That's what a man should do.

299
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,070
Are you being sincere?

300
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:19,690
Of course.

301
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,080
You're pretty good.

302
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,200
But,

303
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,970
just don't forget one thing.

304
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:39,020
Like I only have one heart, my love is only for you.

305
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,150
Bo Reum's dad.

306
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:45,490
Sook, you're...

307
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:51,750
the first and only love of my life.

308
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,390
Thanks.

309
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:59,600
Thanks, Bo Reum's dad.

310
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,960
And, I'm sorry.

311
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:08,520
Why are you sorry...?

312
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:14,460
I'm the one who has committed a crime for giving you a difficult life.

313
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,970
No...

314
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:18,300
You're not a criminal.

315
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,960
You're a good guy.

316
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,900
Kang Sook!

317
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:31,170
I did wrong.

318
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:34,170
I'll never cheat on you.

319
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,090
You're Lee Se Yoon's guardian, right?

320
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,600
Yes, so...

321
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,490
This belongs to Lee Se Yoon but

322
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:05,280
I wanted to give it earlier, but I must've forgotten.

323
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,040
<i> Do you like it? </i>

324
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:29,680
<i> I'm going back to Seoul right now, </i>

325
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:33,730
<i> so Se Yoon go to your mom. </i>

326
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,180
<i> Chae Won. </i>

327
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,750
<i> Chae Won! </i>

328
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,320
I'm sorry, Se Yoon.

329
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:05,170
If I hadn't done that back then,

330
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,930
this wouldn't have happened.

331
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:17,370
For the last time, just once more...

332
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:22,260
Give me one more chance.

333
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,310
Please...

334
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,050
Why? Are you feeling unwell?

335
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,570
I've no appetite.

336
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,430
Even if you don't like it, eat it Mom.

337
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,210
If you continue like this, it can be a big problem.

338
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:02,100
What am I to do when I don't have any appetite.

339
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:06,580
Even when I'm sitting still,

340
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:10,740
my stomach feels like it's on a roller coaster ride.

341
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,300
I feel naseous and

342
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:16,520
everything is about to come up from my stomach and

343
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,400
I feel like I'm going to suffer like this and

344
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,080
not able to live out my age.

345
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,330
Come with me to the hospital Mom.

346
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:31,560
Aigoo, forget it.

347
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,360
It's without a doubt the emotional disorder so what the point in going to a hospital?

348
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:39,740
Be it emotional or internal illness, let's have a doctor check you out first.

349
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,170
Forget it!

350
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:44,470
Why waste money?

351
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:46,570
Mom, seriously!

352
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:50,280
You scared me.

353
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:55,170
Please just listen to me.

354
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:56,310
Yeah, Mom.

355
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:59,020
If you leave illness from emotional stress alone for too long, it can lead to a serious illness.

356
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,800
Go and come back safely.

357
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,410
Fine.

358
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:05,320
I said fine.

359
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,050
Let's go.

360
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:17,030
I'm going to go park the car, so on go in first.

361
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:19,670
Aigoo, alright.

362
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:27,700
This car is the size of a nostril.

363
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,270
Excuse us, excuse us.

364
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,340
Wait, who is that?

365
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,690
Isn't that Lee Se Yoon.

366
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:41,540
Wait a moment.

367
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,860
Where did this person get hurt to come here?

368
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:45,140
He was in a car accident.

369
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,820
Car accident?

370
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,110
Where are you taking him right now?

371
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:51,140
We are in the process of moving him from a critical care unit to general admission.

372
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,040
Hey, Lee Se Yoon.

373
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,660
Open your eyes. It's me, Kim Cheol Gyoo.

374
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:59,560
This patient has not gained consciousness?

375
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,880
We aren't sure.

376
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,130
You're interfering with moving the patient, so please move.

377
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,960
Oh...ok.

378
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,110
He was in a car accident? What is this now?

379
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:16,020
The edema reduction in the brain went well, and the pressure on the brain decreased.

380
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,780
So, the area operated on has recovered.

381
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:22,100
But, why is he still unconscious?

382
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:25,660
We are utilizing every medical method, so

383
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,340
let's wait and see.

384
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:31,810
Then, you don't know when he will regain consciousness?

385
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:35,050
Yes. To determine whether he would regain consciousness or avoid disability,

386
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:37,180
it is a bit premature to decide at this moment.

387
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,510
We should wait and see how it develops.

388
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,590
Only,

389
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,910
if the coma state continues for more than 4 months,

390
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,320
then the likely of recovery

391
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,460
diminishes to less than 15%.

392
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:53,720
So what your saying is, that our Se Yoon..

393
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,480
No, it can't be. Not four months...not even four days!

394
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:02,230
Please, please save my son.

395
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:06,680
Calm down, that definitely won't happen.

396
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:10,240
Don't worry ahead of time.

397
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,810
What are you doing here?

398
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:29,040
Chae Won.

399
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:43,950
How did you know about this?

400
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,160
We came here for my mom's check up because she wasn't feeling well.

401
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:51,550
I happened to see him in the hallway as I was passing by.

402
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,900
I overheard it in passing, but

403
00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:01,610
it sounds like he hasn't been able to regain consciousness, is that right?

404
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:05,570
Se Yoon,

405
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:07,960
will regain consciousness for certain!

406
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,480
Until he regains consciousness,

407
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,830
be it a year or 10 years,

408
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,860
until the day I die, I will protect him.

409
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,180
Chae Won.

410
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,240
Therefore,

411
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,720
there is no way that I am coming back to you.

412
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,080
Stop waiting for something that won't happen.

413
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,000
So please,

414
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:33,090
don't persist in staying and lurking around my vicinity.

415
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,440
Please find your own path and go.

416
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:41,960
This is my last request.

417
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,710
Choon Hee.

418
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:11,000
Se Yoon,

419
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,860
watch over him.

420
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:16,440
I'm leaving.

421
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,400
Unni...

422
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,100
Perhaps, Se Yoon...

423
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:24,210
wants to be with you too.

424
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,730
The last person he wanted to see

425
00:30:27,730 --> 00:30:29,750
was you.

426
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:35,120
All the mother-son affection you couldn't share until now,

427
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,840
share it now.

428
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:40,390
Also,

429
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:43,290
if you ever need me,

430
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:46,950
call me anytime.

431
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,800
Ok?

432
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,590
You...

433
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:54,920
I'm sure would know how to do it

434
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,550
and take care of him.

435
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,780
Our Se Yoon,

436
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,990
look after him well.

437
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:39,120
My son,

438
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:44,450
you're giving me an extra opportunity to be a mom, right?

439
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:52,510
Because you know that mom is so frustrated and upset

440
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:56,660
over being separated for 30 years.

441
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:00,530
You wanted to give me a chance to stay without regret,

442
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:04,450
so you're doing this on purpose, my son?

443
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:30,190
Just...

444
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,180
where did he-

445
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:35,220
Hey!

446
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:41,950
Where did you go that you are just coming back now? I had to get a checkup all alone.

447
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:45,280
Is that so? I just happened to meet someone that I know.

448
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,070
Hand me the prescription. I'll go fill it for you.

449
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:53,830
What business does that woman have here?

450
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:56,800
Pretend like you don't know.

451
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,030
Let go of me.

452
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:03,080
Last time when I went to Chae Won's factory,

453
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,750
I said some harsh things, so

454
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,810
I felt yucky all along.
 This is good.

455
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,480
What's wrong with you?

456
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,980
Lee Se Yoon.

457
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:15,520
Has been admitted into this hospital.

458
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,840
Why?

459
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,730
He was in a car accident.

460
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,620
Car accident?

461
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,870
How badly is he hurt? Is it serious?

462
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,910
We're back.

463
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:40,200
Did Se Yoon wake up?

464
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,300
Not yet.

465
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,340
You mean he's still unconscious?

466
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:50,790
Ah, longer it lasts worse it gets. What to do?

467
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:53,630
What about Hyungnim?

468
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,370
Didn't you guys go together?

469
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:57,980
She's with Se Yoon.

470
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,470
We are going to switch later on tonight.

471
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:03,620
Which room in O-Neul (Today) hospital is he in? I should go there.

472
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:06,120
Later, Mother-in-law.

473
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,930
She wanted to be alone with Se Yoon,

474
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:14,080
that's why we came back.

475
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,460
You should go when things calm down a bit.

476
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,430
Ok then.

477
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,430
Aigoo.

478
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,480
Aigoo.

479
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,080
What can we do for my poor puppy?

480
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,540
We're going to have a heat stroke at this rate.

481
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,280
Are you okay, Honey?

482
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:45,340
I'm fine.

483
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,190
Don't worry about me,

484
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,090
just go home and rest.

485
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:49,970
Don't suffer with me.

486
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:52,360
How is this suffering?

487
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:56,560
I heard they dropped an unbelievable amount of flyers, but there's not an ant in sight.

488
00:34:57,790 --> 00:34:59,860
Let's just call it a day and retreat?

489
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,320
He's right, Honey.

490
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,640
Let's just fold and go home.

491
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:06,290
I can't do that!

492
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:09,840
This is my first Fan Autographing in my life,

493
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,590
I can't stop here.

494
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,410
Start the music.

495
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,200
In a moment,

496
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,520
Teuroteu genre's Psy,

497
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,390
Teuroteu genre's Gentleman (Psy's follow up hit to GangNam style)

498
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,800
Ddool Uh's Gang Jin's autographing will take place.

499
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,090
To the first

500
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,360
10 fans

501
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,160
we're planning on giving

502
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,920
Gang Jin autographed CD "Ddool Uh."

503
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,370
Run here as quickly as even your eyebrows would blow.

504
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:51,070
This is when you turn on the Ddool Uh!

505
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,980
Ah ci! (Come on)

506
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:56,770
Who is that there?

507
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:58,710
Isn't it Husband Kang?

508
00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:01,150
It looks like it.

509
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,160
It is him.

510
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,600
Sister-in-law is there too.

511
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,710
Just what is he doing over there?

512
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:11,460
It looks like he's having a fan signing.

513
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:14,070
Not a single soul is seen, Mother-in-law.

514
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:17,490
♫ <i> Even if living gets to be hard,</i>

515
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:21,170
♫ <i>I shouldn't get stressed out. </i>♫

516
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:22,970
♫ <i> Love makes me cry.. ♫ </i>

517
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,600
I think we should go and increase the head count, Mother-in-law.

518
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,540
Let's go home.

519
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,310
What?

520
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:31,650
We don't have time.

521
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:33,790
Quickly.

522
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,270
Bo Reum's Mom.

523
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,270
Bo Reum's Mom, are you here?

524
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:41,380
Yes, Mom?

525
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,410
Yes, you

526
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:44,620
quickly make some noodles.

527
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,940
Why noodles?

528
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:06,570
♫ <i> I won’t ever cry again, </i>

529

♫ <i> a little more, dear heart. </i> ♫

532
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:22,390
♫ <i> Because I have you, who is looking at me, </i>

533
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,660
What is this? 
♫ <i> I can withstand this. ♫ </i>

534
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:25,620
What's going on?

535
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:30,180
This is mom's order to provide man power to Kang Jin's fan autographing event.

536
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,300
Man power support?

537
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:42,600
Mom!

538
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,630
Now,

539
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,300
we're about to put on an event that will

540
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,730
cool your hot summer with a singer Kang Jin.

541
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:53,980
Now Teuroteu genre's Psy's Kang Jin fan event is

542
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,250
taking place across the street from the town center.

543
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:02,540
There will be cool summer noodles for the first arrivals.

544
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,150
Come down and eat the cool noodles

545
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:08,610
and get Kang Jin's autograph too.

546
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:10,330
Here. Please come down.

547
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,320
Welcome.

548
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,260
This is a 4th generation noodle.

549
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,280
Please taste it.

550
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,890
You can't only eat the noodles,

551
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:21,370
you must also get an autograph.

552
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:22,100
Yes.

553
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,470
Kang Jin? I've never heard of that singer.

554
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:29,000
Why don't you just sing us a song, live?

555
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,020
♫ Ddool Uh, ddool uh, ddool uh ♫

556
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,880
♫ Break down this blocked world, ddool uh ♫

<i>♫ just look ahead and run ♫</i>

558
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:44,740
♫ Break down my life, just ddool uh ♫

559
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:56,850
Thank you.

560
00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:00,910
♫ <i> Even if living gets to be hard,</i>

561
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:04,710
♫ <i> you shouldn't receive any stress. </i>♫

562
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:08,250
♫ Love makes you cry. ♫

563
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:10,310
♫ Money makes you feel bad about yourself. ♫

564
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:12,320
By the way, I don't see that "being?"

565
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,600
That being?

566
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,580
You know, the In Jeol Mi brushed with sesame oil.

567
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,120
Your first love.

568
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,570
First love?

569
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:21,350
Tell him to get lost.

570
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:28,970
Thanks Mom.

571
00:39:28,970 --> 00:39:32,400
Roof-top Gigolo can at least

572
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,120
belt it out!

573
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:37,250
What do you mean roof-top gigolo? How can you say such things, Mom?

574
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:40,180
Aiyoo, mannerless wench.

575
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,920
You come after me with fire in your eyes

576
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:46,870
if I say anything half bad about her hubby!

577
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,870
I'm kidding, kidding.

578
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,970
<i> Be it a year or 10 years, </i>

579
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:15,730
<i> until the day I die, I will protect him. </i>

580
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:18,290
<i> Me going back to you? </i>

581
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:21,960
<i> It'll be best to stop hoping for something that won't happen. </i>

582
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,470
Yes. Did you call a substitute driver?

583
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:42,950
To the Tae Sang Group headquarter?

584
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:44,630
Yes, yes. I understand. I'm extremely fast.

585
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:45,690
I'll be there within 10 minutes.

586
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:48,430
Go ahead and count only to ten, okay?

587
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:50,630
Ok.

588
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,760
Did you call a substitute driver?

589
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,710
Yes.

590
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:07,340
I'll drive you safely to your destination.

591
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,250
Where would you like to go, Costumer?

592
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:28,820
The terrace land on the Han River?

593
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,080
Ok.

594
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,130
I'm going.

595
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,260
Stop peeping and keep your eyes on the road, shall we?

596
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,960
Yes, I'm sorry.

597
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:07,330
Seriously!

598
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:11,120
What kind of driving is this? Will you straighten up?

599
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:18,330
That's her voice.

600
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:23,030
I guess at least you didn't forget your ex-wife's voice.

601
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,190
It's been awhile,

602
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:32,290
Driver Kim.

603
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:35,230
Why are you here?

604
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:37,140
Business.

605
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,810
Business?

606
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:40,740
I have some ideas to think about for business.

607
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:42,990
Ah, I see. Ideas for your business...

608
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:46,940
I see. How did you find out that I was a substitute driver?

609
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:50,870
The fact that Kim Cheol Gyoo has become a complete pauper and is driving cars for people

610
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:52,830
has even reached Paris.

611
00:42:52,830 --> 00:42:53,990
What did you say?

612
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:55,940
I'm hungry.

613
00:42:56,650 --> 00:43:01,100
Let's not go to the Han River. Let's go somewhere close by to eat,

614
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,390
Driver Kim.

615
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:07,810
Isn't it possible for you to buy a meal

616
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:10,550
to an ex-wife you haven't seen in a while?

617
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,620
Why aren't you driving?

618
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:34,290
Where is this place?

619
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:36,030
This is a train-station cafe.

620
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:39,620
This is the only place I can afford to buy you a meal in my current position.

621
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:44,560
Portion's big, taste is good...within the city of Seoul it's renown as the best drivers' cafe.

622
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,100
Okay, I like it.

623
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,370
Lend me your hand.

624
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:51,570
Asking for all kinds pomp and procedures...

625
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,840
Wa-wah-what is this?

626
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,340
What?

627
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,930
Why is your belly like this? Are you sick?

628
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:08,050
I'm pregnant.

629
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:09,210
P..pr...

630
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:10,750
Pregnant?

631
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,400
Were you remarried in that short time?

632
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,490
Where's the baby's father?

633
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,960
Why did you hit?

634
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,940
Is that something a baby's father should say?

635
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:32,480
Baby-daddy?

636
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,830
Wh... Who? Me?

637
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,780
Wow I'm going to go crazy!

638
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,160
Just once.

639
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,650
I got drunk and made one mistake. Not even twice but just once!

640
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:53,010
And you can get pregnant?

641
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:53,980
I know, right?

642
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:56,540
You have some skills, babe.

643
00:44:56,540 --> 00:44:59,850
Really, how can in just one try can you be pregnant?

644
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:00,920
What kind of...

645
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,980
You sure are repeating "just once" a lot.

646
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:06,440
Do you want me to name the child in our belly "just once?"

647
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,900
Can you joke in a time like this?

648
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,760
Ms. Na Hong Joo.

649
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,450
Look me straight in the eyes and say it.

650
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:16,100
Is this really my baby?

651
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,280
Are you absolutely certain?

652
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,900
Oh, okay! I'm sorry.

653
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:26,350
Sorry! Really, I'm sorry.

654
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:34,750
I won't say to be responsible for this so

655
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:36,750
don't feel burdened.

656
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,120
Not that it's a burden but

657
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:43,810
it's just so sudden, that's what...

658
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:50,730
I'm... saying.

659
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:52,790
How are you feeling?

660
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:55,140
Do you have any morning-sickness or...?

661
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:58,930
The baby in my tummy is so sweet not at all like us.

662
00:45:58,930 --> 00:46:02,720
As you can tell, I don't have morning sickness and don't have any discomfort.

663
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:05,800
I'm glad.

664
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:09,630
How is it going with the ex-wife?

665
00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:15,380
I guess not so good?

666
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,380
Ahjumma!

667
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,850
Can you bring out one more Jab-Chae-bob (chop suey rice), please?

668
00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:27,180
You want to order another Jab-Chae-bab?

669
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:29,300
Are you throwing a banquet? When are you going to eat all this?

670
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,350
Ai! Small scale...

671
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:33,830
I'll pay for the meal.

672
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:40,910
Well, I'm not saying that because I have no money to pay for the meal or anything..

673
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:59,150
It's time for you to get up now.

674
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:02,400
Wake up and take a walk with mom and

675
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,270
take a trip together. Hm?

676
00:47:16,190 --> 00:47:18,280
You're here.

677
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:21,250
I'm glad you're here, Chae Won.

678
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:26,940
Tonight, I'll stay with him.

679
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,680
Mom, why don't you go home with dad.

680
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,830
No, it's okay.

681
00:47:30,830 --> 00:47:33,650
I'm sure you're tired from working all day at the factory.

682
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:36,630
Why don't you let Chae Won take over tonight?

683
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:41,240
Mother-in-law is waiting at home with bells on.

684
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:45,230
Yes, Mom.

685
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:51,480
Let me have a date with Se Yoon too, please.

686
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,780
I understand.

687
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:00,330
Se Yoon,

688
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:02,070
Mom's going to go now

689
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:05,020
and come back early tomorrow morning, okay?

690
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:09,500
Take care of him.

691
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,170
Okay.

692
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:12,340
Drive carefully.

693
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:17,020
<i>♫ We still have much to say...♫</i>

694
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:20,670
<i>♫ We still have much to do...♫</i>

695
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:27,460
<i>♫ Maybe I'm bad?♫</i><b><i>♫ Is someone taking good care of you? ♫</i></b>

696
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:31,260
<i>♫ Maybe I'm still saying goodbye...♫</i><b><i>♫ I think ♫</i></b>

697
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:33,700
I'm here.<b><i>♫ I'm living a life frozen in time. ♫</i></b>

698
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,210
Because I was worried about you all day,

699
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:41,220
my battery is completely drained.

700
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:45,130
<i>♫ I should not think of you...♫</i>

701
00:48:45,130 --> 00:48:47,340
Can you recharge me?<b><i>♫ because we have parted ways. ♫</i></b>

702
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:54,700
<i>♫ Why am I so dumb like this? ♫</i><b><i>♫ Is this all that I could be? ♫</i></b>

00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,780

704
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:57,640

00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,940
<i>♫ All I do is worry about you...♫</i>

706

707
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:04,650
<i>Ai, hurry up and recharge me. I'm completely out!</i>

708
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:11,830
<i>♫ Me, who's in your eyes...♫</i>

709
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:14,460

710
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:19,260

711

713
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:28,770
<i>Recharging complete.

714
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:36,020
<i>♫ in your eyes... ♫</i>

715
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:37,800
What's this?

716
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:42,730
Since you've recharged me

717
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:45,290
I feel energized.

718
00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:55,510
What are you talking about?

719
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:57,840
What do you mean Sun Bae (Se Yoon) is in a coma?

720
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,830
Are you serious? I've been saying it the whole time.

721
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:03,330
Why do you ask again?

722
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:06,610
He was in an accident and received a brain surgery

723
00:50:06,610 --> 00:50:10,490
but he still hasn't gained consciousness for few days.

724
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:14,350
If his condition continues, could he

725
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:16,170
be in a permanent vegetative state?

726
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:17,870
Why do you say such an unlucky thing?!

727
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:21,130
Why do you shout so loudly, you scared me to death!

728
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:24,630
Of course I'm saying it because I'm worried. Worried!

729
00:50:27,870 --> 00:50:29,670
If I think about it now

730
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:34,880
Se Yoon really was a genuine person.

731
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:38,960
Hey, hey, Joo Ri! Where are you going in the middle of your meal?

732
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:39,810
I'm done.

733
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:41,370
I'll be right back!

734
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:46,450
Aigoo, that girl just shout aloud and...

735
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:48,870
I'm back.

736
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:50,550
Ai...hey, you worked hard.

737
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:52,300
Wash your hands before you sit down.

738
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,790
Mom will make you a plate.

739
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:56,180
I don't have any appetite.

740
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,750
Why don't you have any appetite?

741
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:02,630
Why? Did something happen?

742
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,330
Is there something going on?

743
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:09,120
Hong Joo,

744
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,650
came back to Korea, Mom.

745
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:16,690
That being...what's there to gain by coming back?

746
00:51:17,790 --> 00:51:19,240
Hey,

747
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,090
do you have her contact information?

748
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:23,500
I'd like to meet with her.

749
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,170
You Mom? Why?

750
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:29,810
I've been thinking that we've given too much of alimony.

751
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:32,000
Even if it's little, we should get back some of that money

752
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,750
and buy a decent apartment...

753
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:35,630
MOM! 
Aigoo!

754
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:40,950
Hey you scared me half to death! Why in the world are you all shouting?

755
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:43,600
I almost dropped (lost) a baby! ("drop" = colloquialism for losing a baby. Typical expression when one is shocked.)

756
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,360
Are you pregnant too?

757
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,350
What?

758
00:51:47,350 --> 00:51:50,610
You...imbecile.

759
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:54,060
How in the world this old mom be pregnant?

760
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:59,460
Cham (Man, I just don't understand...)

761
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,290
You uncaring thing,

762
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:20,240
how can you so cruelly cut off communication without even a phone call?

763
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,730
Was the attachment you and I formed so shallow?

764
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:26,830
I'm sorry.

765
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,760
I thought that me disappearing

766
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,090
was the best way for the children.

767
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:34,700
I'm so sorry.

768
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:39,910
Are the kids the only thing that you care about and not the family?

769
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:42,320
Your father was

770
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:44,710
until the end

771
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:47,990
missing you so much.

772
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:49,830
I'm so sorry.

773
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:55,890
I made such a terrible filial sin, I'm sorry.

774
00:52:55,890 --> 00:52:59,500
I'm sure father-in-law understood all.

775
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,720
Definitely,

776
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:05,180
he was so pleased with the Soo Yi (burlap wrap for burial) you made for him.

777
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,140
By the way,

778
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:13,410
Se Yoon should regain consciousness soon. I'm worried.

779
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:16,330
Don't worry about that.

780
00:53:16,330 --> 00:53:19,960
Your father isn't someone who'd just spectate up in heaven.

781
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,940
He will use what leverage he has over the Great Jade Emperor

782
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:26,520
to have Se Yoon return to the way he was, so don't you worry a thing.

783
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:27,420
That's right.

784
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:29,500
Listening to this, I think Mother-in-law is right.

785
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:32,820
Let's just tie down all our worries!

786
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:35,610
I'm sorry.

787
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:38,020
I made you worry so much.

788
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:40,730
And,

789
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:44,010
thank you for welcoming me back.

790
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:51,060
My mom likes it!

791
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,670
Yes?

792
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:23,340
I came.

793
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:28,730
I was too worried so I came even though it was shameless.

794
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:30,400
I'm sorry.

795
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,190
No reason to be sorry.

796
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:35,120
Se Yoon would be happy to see you.

797
00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:43,970
Sun Bae,

798
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:46,420
why are you lying down like this?

799
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:48,670
Get up please.

800
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:53,530
I had such a hard time over Eun Seol's car accident,

801
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:56,250
how can you be down like this too?

802
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:01,260
I didn't have a chance to apologize to you properly for all the bad things I've done.

803
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:04,590
What am I supposed to do with you lying unconscious like this, Sun Bae?

804
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:09,340
Get up, I beg you.

805
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:12,430
Get up and listen to what I have to say, please?

806
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:30,890
I don't know if God would listen to a prayer from a bad girl like me, but

807
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:35,200
I'll pray that Se Yoon wakes up soon.

808
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:38,530
Thank you.

809
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:46,050
You are having such a hard time...

810
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,890
Unni (older sister)

811
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:55,850
I can start to understand how you felt now that I'm in a difficult situation.

812
00:55:55,850 --> 00:55:59,620
And sometimes I feel like I'm being punished for all the bad things I've done.

813
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:01,550
I feel like that.

814
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:07,090
I've been too harsh to you in the past.

815
00:56:07,090 --> 00:56:09,100
I didn't give you proper respect as an older person,

816
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,710
belittled you,

817
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:13,300
wrongly frame you.

818
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,970
I should have stopped mom when she did those things.

819
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:21,030
instead I did worse than her next to mom

820
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:23,490
and tormented you..

821
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:26,020
I was immature.

822
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:34,440
If I came to my senses a little earlier...

823
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:39,600
Unni and I, aside from being sisters-in-law,

824
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:43,540
do you think we could have perhaps have been good friends?

825
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,850
I'm off.

826
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:28,040
Before you come to meet me, won't you go meet the flower first?

827
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:32,500
Then, we would never ever fight

828
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:34,980
without talking bad about others

829
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:38,380
and through talk of lovely things.

830
00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:54,650
What is it again?

831
00:58:54,650 --> 00:58:56,000
What again? You say?

832
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,770
You can't say "what again" to the customer.

833
00:58:57,770 --> 00:59:02,340
I better call your company and complain that they should train their drivers better.

834
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:05,300
Why do you keep calling me back and forth?

835
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:08,910
I have a check-up scheduled for today. I want you to go with me.

836
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:15,720
Don't you think you should at least do this much as a father of the baby?

837
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:16,970
Well, you're right but...

838
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:19,080
Open the door, Driver Kim.

839
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:23,520
I said, open the door!

840
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:26,600
This woman is really...

841
00:59:29,590 --> 00:59:31,480
Wider!

842
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:34,160
Yes, ma'am.

843
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:45,490
I'm going crazy here.

844
00:59:45,490 --> 00:59:48,430
Stuff I saw on TV is happening to me.

845
00:59:49,810 --> 00:59:51,960
As you see,10 fingers,

846
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,360
10 toes,

847
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:57,030
two ears, mouth, and nose. Everything is fine.

848
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:58,550
When we take a detailed sonogram,

849
00:59:58,550 --> 01:00:00,690
babies don't position their bodies favorable so usually

850
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:02,640
it's so hard for the mother.

851
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,070
But, the baby doesn't want the mother to work so hard.

852
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:06,770
All of it's 10 fingers are spread.

853
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:08,360
I see.

854
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:11,090
Is the baby healthy, Doctor?

855
01:00:11,090 --> 01:00:12,130
Yes,

856
01:00:12,130 --> 01:00:16,380
kidney, lungs, liver, spine, everything is normal.

857
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:19,360
I think it's moving!

858
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,680
Is it yawning, Doctor?

859
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:22,620
Yes,

860
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:24,030
it seems so.

861
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:26,120
Wow! It's so amazing!

862
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,500
Look, look, look, right Honey?

863
01:00:28,540 --> 01:00:30,020
I mean, Hong Joo.

864
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:31,890
Chi (oh, please.)

865
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,070
Is there anywhere you feel uncomfortable?

866
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:38,750
Around my lower back there is some.

867
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:41,880
That's because you gained weight suddenly.

868
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:45,550
It's good for the husband to massage the area before bedtime.

869
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:49,270
It's good at calming the fetus as well.

870
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:19,970
It's been over a month since he has been moved here, Doc.

871
01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:23,250
When will he wake up?

872
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:27,930
In the case of this patient, the condition isn't simply an unconsciousness or unawareness but

873
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:32,110
it has progressed to a vegetative state.

874
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:35,120
A vegetative state?

875
01:01:35,120 --> 01:01:38,440
When the condition is prolonged in this state for more than a month,

876
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:42,370
it is accurate to assume he will not regain consciousness.

877
01:01:42,370 --> 01:01:44,240
Then,

878
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,660
forever

879
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:49,190
he cannot wake up...

880
01:01:49,190 --> 01:01:51,880
is that what you're saying?
