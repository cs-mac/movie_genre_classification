this program helps our kids.

<i>with letters. I mean, flood them.</i>

1338
01:29:31,156 --> 01:29:33,852
It doesn't matter how many letters you
send them. It's just not in the budget.

1339

- What if we raise the money ourselves?
- Oh, they wouldn't object.

[Dorothea]
What if you did a benefit concert?

1341
01:29:39,164 --> 01:29:42,930
<i>We could raise a batch of money</i>
<i>from the ticket sales,</i>

be great publicity for the program.

It can't just be me
and the kids, I don't think,
not if you're gonna charge money.

1344
01:29:50,876 --> 01:29:53,344

to play with you and the kids.

Arnold and... Arnold would do this?

do this, though?

<i>Seriously, you think they would?</i>
- Yes, yes.

1352
01:30:11,130 --> 01:30:15,499
And we could rent a place like the
92nd Street "Y." It's perfect for this.

1353
01:30:15,567 --> 01:30:19,333
- It seats about 900 people.
- Nine hundred would be more than enough.

1354
01:30:19,405 --> 01:30:23,000
And if we charge between
$50 and $100 a ticket, then...

1355
01:30:23,075 --> 01:30:25,407

how he could help.

Then Wally had this brilliant idea
and called his friend Isaac Stern,
