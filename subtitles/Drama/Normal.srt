1
00:02:45,004 --> 00:02:47,677
I remember when Roy brought Irma home.

2
00:02:48,244 --> 00:02:52,635
He took me aside and said,
''Mama, I think this is the one.''

3
00:02:53,004 --> 00:02:55,518
I wanted him to stay and run the farm.

4
00:02:55,604 --> 00:02:58,038
But he said no, he'd rather be dead.

5
00:02:58,124 --> 00:03:00,797
-Dad, time for the toast.
-I'm telling a story.

6
00:03:01,924 --> 00:03:05,394
I got so mad,
I hauled off and popped him one.

7
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:07,919
Gave him a shiner on his wedding day.

8
00:03:08,724 --> 00:03:11,522
Let's get Roy and Irma up here!
Where are they?

9
00:03:12,084 --> 00:03:15,156
Come on, let's go,
before they enter their 26th!

10
00:03:18,924 --> 00:03:21,597
-Are we all here?
-Yeah, we are!

11
00:03:25,524 --> 00:03:29,403
I remember when Roy and Irma
first joined our congregation.

12
00:03:29,724 --> 00:03:32,079
What was it, 21 years ago?

13
00:03:33,284 --> 00:03:36,401
They had more energy
and more goodwill toward each other...

14
00:03:36,484 --> 00:03:38,042
than any couple I ever knew.

15
00:03:38,124 --> 00:03:41,321
The goodwill is still there.
I don't know about the energy.

16
00:03:42,324 --> 00:03:45,122
I remember their first pancake breakfast.

17
00:03:45,204 --> 00:03:48,799
Roy at the griddle,
Irma right behind him with the batter.

18
00:03:48,924 --> 00:03:52,678
As soon as he'd scoop up one pancake,
she'd plop down another one.

19
00:03:52,764 --> 00:03:55,073
Never a cross word between them.

20
00:03:56,004 --> 00:03:58,996
In fact, the more pressure
that was on them...

21
00:03:59,084 --> 00:04:01,882
the more they seemed to enjoy each other.

22
00:04:02,364 --> 00:04:05,879
I don't know of any other couple
in our congregation...

23
00:04:06,244 --> 00:04:08,633
or in this town, for that matter...

24
00:04:08,884 --> 00:04:11,034
more devoted to each other...

25
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:14,796
more in love than Roy and Irma.

26
00:04:16,204 --> 00:04:18,638
I'm grateful to have them with us...

27
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:22,160
because we're all beneficiaries
of that partnership.

28
00:04:22,564 --> 00:04:24,236
Happy anniversary.

29
00:04:34,924 --> 00:04:36,403
Get an ambulance.

30
00:04:37,524 --> 00:04:38,877
Is he drunk?

31
00:04:47,524 --> 00:04:48,843
Dear God...

32
00:04:49,124 --> 00:04:53,117
help this couple find the wisdom
to work out their differences...

33
00:04:53,204 --> 00:04:55,877
and rekindle the joy of their marriage.

34
00:04:56,164 --> 00:05:00,635
Shed your light upon them, so that
they may continue to grow and flourish...

35
00:05:00,724 --> 00:05:04,194
in the love that they have for you
and for each other.

36
00:05:04,484 --> 00:05:05,758
Amen.

37
00:05:09,244 --> 00:05:13,283
Roy, I heard what happened the other night.
Are you all right?

38
00:05:13,364 --> 00:05:16,322
-I'm fine. It was nothing.
-Scared me half to death.

39
00:05:16,684 --> 00:05:20,472
We took him to the hospital,
but everything turned out okay.

40
00:05:20,564 --> 00:05:22,122
Thank goodness.

41
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:27,557
I think it has something to do
with the headaches.

42
00:05:28,124 --> 00:05:31,719
I mean, he's been getting terrible,
terrible headaches.

43
00:05:31,804 --> 00:05:35,001
-Have you seen a doctor about this?
-Every one in the phone book.

44
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,552
-He's had a CAT scan.
-Insurance will cut me loose.

45
00:05:37,644 --> 00:05:39,760
-Did they find anything?
-No.

46
00:05:42,044 --> 00:05:46,162
I think it's....
His doctor seems to think it's stress.

47
00:05:46,484 --> 00:05:48,395
Has your work been stressful?

48
00:05:49,164 --> 00:05:51,120
There's some pressure on me.

49
00:05:51,324 --> 00:05:55,237
-Honey, there's a lot of pressure on you.
-No more than usual.

50
00:05:56,644 --> 00:06:00,193
He used to have to handle just the tractors.

51
00:06:00,284 --> 00:06:03,117
But now, he has to take care of everything...

52
00:06:03,204 --> 00:06:07,436
from the cuItivators to the combines....

53
00:06:08,244 --> 00:06:09,233
Yikes!

54
00:06:09,324 --> 00:06:12,999
So you could say that maybe
these headaches are work-related.

55
00:06:13,524 --> 00:06:15,037
They could be.

56
00:06:16,444 --> 00:06:19,436
Is there anything else in your life
that's been bothering you?

57
00:06:19,524 --> 00:06:23,199
You can always find something.

58
00:06:25,604 --> 00:06:28,118
Honey, I think there's been some...

59
00:06:29,324 --> 00:06:31,679
strain between us lately.

60
00:06:31,764 --> 00:06:34,039
Sure, there's been some strain.

61
00:06:35,004 --> 00:06:38,394
Are you having any problems with...

62
00:06:39,564 --> 00:06:40,792
intimacy?

63
00:06:41,404 --> 00:06:42,439
Not really.

64
00:06:42,524 --> 00:06:44,992
We haven't had much intimacy lately.

65
00:06:45,084 --> 00:06:47,040
Because of the headaches?

66
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:51,833
Yes.

67
00:06:56,004 --> 00:06:58,564
Would you like to talk to me alone?

68
00:07:03,324 --> 00:07:05,758
Whatever it is, just get it out, honey.

69
00:07:05,844 --> 00:07:08,358
I don't even have to know what it is.

70
00:07:08,444 --> 00:07:11,277
I mean, just talk it out with him, okay?

71
00:07:11,724 --> 00:07:12,713
Please?

72
00:07:12,844 --> 00:07:15,404
Irma, if you want,
you can wait in the chapel.

73
00:07:15,484 --> 00:07:18,396
No, I'd like Irma to stay.

74
00:07:18,964 --> 00:07:20,397
Better still.

75
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:26,633
Tell us what's on your mind, Roy.

76
00:07:37,804 --> 00:07:39,203
I've been...

77
00:07:39,804 --> 00:07:42,637
struggling with something for a long time.

78
00:07:46,964 --> 00:07:49,683
I prayed for years for it to go away.

79
00:07:51,484 --> 00:07:52,963
But it won't.

80
00:07:56,204 --> 00:07:57,273
Go on.

81
00:08:01,644 --> 00:08:03,874
I was born in the wrong body.

82
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:09,237
I'm a woman. I've known it all my life.

83
00:08:10,684 --> 00:08:12,163
Oh, my gosh, Roy.

84
00:08:12,244 --> 00:08:15,361
Good grief, Roy...

85
00:08:16,804 --> 00:08:18,635
I don't know what to say.

86
00:08:18,724 --> 00:08:20,396
I don't either, except...

87
00:08:20,484 --> 00:08:23,601
I love Irma very much.

88
00:08:23,684 --> 00:08:27,518
The last thing I want to do
is cause her any pain.

89
00:08:31,804 --> 00:08:34,637
-Roy, are you having an affair?
-No, Irma.

90
00:08:36,964 --> 00:08:40,354
But this doesn't make any sense.

91
00:08:40,884 --> 00:08:42,875
Roy, I have to agree.

92
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:47,113
I mean, you've been married to Irma
for 25 years.

93
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:50,800
You have two wonderful children,
and suddenly, out of nowhere...

94
00:08:50,884 --> 00:08:53,000
you make this strange declaration?

95
00:08:53,084 --> 00:08:55,962
It's not out of nowhere.
I've been hiding it for years.

96
00:08:56,044 --> 00:08:59,559
It's been an agony.
I can't go on living my life like this.

97
00:08:59,644 --> 00:09:01,077
I'd rather die.

98
00:09:01,164 --> 00:09:03,803
Oh, my God, do you mean that?

99
00:09:03,884 --> 00:09:04,839
Yes.

100
00:09:08,644 --> 00:09:12,956
Before you jump to any more conclusions
about yourself...

101
00:09:14,284 --> 00:09:17,401
what exactly appeals to you
about being a woman?

102
00:09:18,804 --> 00:09:21,443
What appeals to you about being a man?

103
00:09:21,564 --> 00:09:22,963
Many things.

104
00:09:23,244 --> 00:09:27,032
Beginning with the fact
that this is the form God chose for me.

105
00:09:27,124 --> 00:09:30,673
But I believe that God meant for me
to be something else.

106
00:09:31,684 --> 00:09:34,244
-Meaning?
-Meaning I'd like to...

107
00:09:35,524 --> 00:09:37,355
have the operation...

108
00:09:38,204 --> 00:09:39,842
to change my sex.

109
00:09:44,324 --> 00:09:45,962
Oh, my God, Roy.

110
00:09:52,604 --> 00:09:57,359
Obviously, this is a lot
for us to comprehend, Roy.

111
00:09:57,444 --> 00:09:59,639
You know, I'd like to go home.

112
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,557
I think this would be a good point to stop.

113
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:05,112
Obviously, I wasn't prepared for this.

114
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:09,482
If you two could give me a few days
to do some research, think this over....

115
00:10:09,564 --> 00:10:12,032
Roy, I'm not exactly sure...

116
00:10:12,124 --> 00:10:16,356
how I'm going to counsel you at this point,
but I promise I'm not giving up.

117
00:10:16,844 --> 00:10:19,199
I just want to be sure that...

118
00:10:19,884 --> 00:10:23,320
you'll still accept me
as a member of the congregation.

119
00:10:23,844 --> 00:10:26,119
Heck, you're the only fellow I can get...

120
00:10:26,204 --> 00:10:30,356
to nail together the nativity every year.
You think I'll let you go that easy?

121
00:11:08,404 --> 00:11:09,393
What?

122
00:11:10,564 --> 00:11:12,043
What did I do?

123
00:11:12,604 --> 00:11:14,083
Nothing, honey.

124
00:11:15,404 --> 00:11:17,042
Then someone talk.

125
00:11:18,724 --> 00:11:20,077
How was school?

126
00:11:20,964 --> 00:11:23,194
Don't talk to me, talk to each other.

127
00:11:26,844 --> 00:11:29,119
Your dad and I both had a long day...

128
00:11:29,204 --> 00:11:32,241
and we just don't feel like talking.

129
00:11:34,564 --> 00:11:35,997
Talk anyway.

130
00:11:39,164 --> 00:11:40,756
Finish your peas.

131
00:11:49,924 --> 00:11:52,757
Irma, we couldn't go on
the way things were.

132
00:11:52,844 --> 00:11:54,641
Look at how unhappy I've made you.

133
00:11:54,724 --> 00:11:56,282
I'm not unhappy.

134
00:11:56,444 --> 00:11:58,719
There's been a strain between us for years.

135
00:11:58,804 --> 00:11:59,604
-This is supposed to make it better?
-I'm hoping so. Yes.

136
00:11:59,604 --> 00:12:02,357
-This is supposed to make it better?
-I'm hoping so. Yes.

137
00:12:05,964 --> 00:12:08,319
Did you feel this way when you met me?

138
00:12:08,404 --> 00:12:10,122
I suspected it, yes.

139
00:12:10,364 --> 00:12:13,754
Then what in heaven's name
were you thinking of on our wedding day?

140
00:12:13,844 --> 00:12:16,756
-That you were the one for me.
-Meaning what?

141
00:12:16,844 --> 00:12:19,802
Meaning that I loved you, I love you.

142
00:12:22,804 --> 00:12:24,556
When we're in bed...

143
00:12:25,724 --> 00:12:28,113
are you a man or are you a woman?

144
00:12:28,844 --> 00:12:32,962
-I make love to you as myself.
-But are you a man, or are you a woman?

145
00:12:34,164 --> 00:12:38,555
Sometimes, I imagine
I have a different body. Not always.

146
00:12:41,084 --> 00:12:44,997
Sometimes, the female part takes over.

147
00:12:47,164 --> 00:12:50,042
I have some books you could read.

148
00:12:52,604 --> 00:12:53,753
Books?

149
00:12:53,964 --> 00:12:56,034
About my condition.

150
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:59,041
About the operation.

151
00:12:59,244 --> 00:13:03,635
You mean, you expect us to go on
living together after you do this thing?

152
00:13:04,844 --> 00:13:06,402
If you'll have me.

153
00:13:06,684 --> 00:13:09,676
Frankly, honey,
there's no way you're a woman.

154
00:13:10,204 --> 00:13:12,638
Only a man could be this selfish.

155
00:13:13,764 --> 00:13:16,073
-Mom?
-What is it, Patty?

156
00:13:16,524 --> 00:13:20,119
-Could you come out here for a minute?
-Is it something important?

157
00:13:20,764 --> 00:13:21,799
Yes.

158
00:13:29,444 --> 00:13:30,843
What is it?

159
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:33,082
Mom, it happened.

160
00:13:36,844 --> 00:13:38,357
Just a minute.

161
00:13:40,124 --> 00:13:42,922
-You all right, Patty?
-It's nothing.

162
00:13:47,804 --> 00:13:50,398
-You want me to show you how to--
-No!

163
00:13:56,444 --> 00:13:58,116
Is she all right?

164
00:13:59,604 --> 00:14:01,242
She got her period.

165
00:14:01,324 --> 00:14:04,236
Poor kid. She sounded so scared.

166
00:14:06,124 --> 00:14:10,117
You are not to breathe a word to her
about any of this. Do you understand?

167
00:14:10,204 --> 00:14:13,958
-She has to know about me at some point.
-No, I won't allow you to do this.

168
00:14:14,044 --> 00:14:16,478
-There's a way to handle it properly.
-No!

169
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,795
-Absolutely not!
-Irma, it's not going to go away.

170
00:14:19,884 --> 00:14:22,557
Get out! Get out of my bedroom!

171
00:14:26,564 --> 00:14:30,352
-I'll sleep on the couch.
-No, I don't want you in this house.

172
00:14:31,564 --> 00:14:32,917
All right.

173
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:21,676
If this is only a separation,
why are you throwing out all of Dad's stuff?

174
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:26,994
Is that what you're wearing to school?
Go change your clothes.

175
00:16:27,924 --> 00:16:29,039
Why?

176
00:16:29,924 --> 00:16:31,880
Don't argue, just do it.

177
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,243
How you doing, Roy?

178
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:21,803
-Morning, Roy.
-Morning, Bob.

179
00:17:22,804 --> 00:17:24,999
Another goddamn day.

180
00:17:27,564 --> 00:17:30,124
Not a damn thing we can do about it, either.

181
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:32,963
See you later.

182
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,164
So, I talked to a pastor in Akron.

183
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:49,163
He was counselling a married couple...

184
00:17:49,244 --> 00:17:51,917
and the husband said that
he was a homosexual.

185
00:17:52,644 --> 00:17:56,762
He was able to persuade the husband
not to act on his inclinations...

186
00:17:56,844 --> 00:17:58,721
and he saved the marriage.

187
00:17:59,204 --> 00:18:02,640
-Sounds hopeful.
-I'm feeling very hopeful about this.

188
00:18:02,724 --> 00:18:04,237
Now, what this pastor did...

189
00:18:04,324 --> 00:18:07,475
he referred this couple
to a chapter in the Bible...

190
00:18:07,564 --> 00:18:11,000
which I think
very elegantly supports our case.

191
00:18:14,204 --> 00:18:16,160
Did you bring your Bible?

192
00:18:16,684 --> 00:18:18,163
No, I'm sorry.

193
00:18:18,484 --> 00:18:20,759
No problem. You can look on with me.

194
00:18:21,804 --> 00:18:25,353
Ephesians, Chapter 5, Verse 28.

195
00:18:27,764 --> 00:18:31,518
''So ought men to love their wives
as their own bodies.

196
00:18:31,884 --> 00:18:34,603
''He that loveth his wife loveth himself.

197
00:18:34,724 --> 00:18:37,636
''For no man ever yet hated his own flesh.''

198
00:18:39,044 --> 00:18:42,639
''For no man ever yet hated his own flesh.''

199
00:18:43,844 --> 00:18:44,833
Bingo!

200
00:18:46,564 --> 00:18:51,194
In other words, men couple with women
to bring out the female side of their nature.

201
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:53,600
And the mistake that Roy's making...

202
00:18:53,684 --> 00:18:57,802
is he's looking to himself for that balance,
instead of to you.

203
00:18:58,924 --> 00:18:59,913
I see.

204
00:19:00,004 --> 00:19:04,202
We need to just make Roy realize
that you're all the woman he needs.

205
00:19:04,284 --> 00:19:07,162
He doesn't have to make himself
into a woman...

206
00:19:07,244 --> 00:19:09,200
parade around in dresses and such.

207
00:19:09,284 --> 00:19:13,562
Heck, that's just plain egotistical of him,
to think that he can do it all.

208
00:19:13,644 --> 00:19:16,238
Men need women for completion.

209
00:19:17,284 --> 00:19:20,242
Why do you think we call our wives
our better halves?

210
00:19:21,524 --> 00:19:25,358
Roy has always felt
overly responsible for things.

211
00:19:25,724 --> 00:19:27,476
He used to come home from work...

212
00:19:27,564 --> 00:19:32,080
do a couple of hours of chores,
and then stay up till midnight paying bills.

213
00:19:32,164 --> 00:19:35,042
No wonder he gets these terrible headaches.

214
00:19:35,804 --> 00:19:39,001
That's why I decided
to take over doing the taxes.

215
00:19:41,644 --> 00:19:44,363
Irma, let me ask you something.

216
00:19:45,204 --> 00:19:47,957
And this may just be a stab in the dark.

217
00:19:50,524 --> 00:19:54,437
Do you think you might have unknowingly
added to his confusion?

218
00:19:57,724 --> 00:19:59,794
I don't know what you mean.

219
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:04,442
Please understand, I'm not questioning
your love for Roy in any way.

220
00:20:04,524 --> 00:20:08,358
It's just that you're
a very strong-willed person...

221
00:20:08,564 --> 00:20:12,557
and I'm just wondering if you often take
the upper hand with Roy.

222
00:20:12,804 --> 00:20:14,283
Do you mean...

223
00:20:15,204 --> 00:20:17,593
have I emasculated him?

224
00:20:18,564 --> 00:20:22,557
I haven't made myself clear. Forgive me.

225
00:20:24,404 --> 00:20:25,439
Gosh!

226
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:30,314
I think it's a problem that
every modern couple is having right now.

227
00:20:31,044 --> 00:20:33,114
Who's the head of the household?

228
00:20:33,204 --> 00:20:36,480
Is it the one who brings home
the biggest pay check?

229
00:20:36,604 --> 00:20:41,041
Heck, I'm not going to win on that one.
Not with what I make on a pastor's salary.

230
00:20:41,564 --> 00:20:43,236
But I don't work.

231
00:20:43,604 --> 00:20:45,003
I know that.

232
00:20:45,404 --> 00:20:48,840
From what I've observed,
you've been a very good wife.

233
00:20:51,644 --> 00:20:53,874
I don't know what I'm doing wrong.

234
00:20:53,964 --> 00:20:57,673
I don't know either, Irma,
but we'll figure it out.

235
00:21:32,204 --> 00:21:36,163
I keep smelling this goddamn perfume.
Where the hell is it coming from?

236
00:21:36,244 --> 00:21:38,314
I think it's Roy over there.

237
00:21:38,724 --> 00:21:42,034
Roy, you dog, have you been stepping out
on your wife?

238
00:21:42,124 --> 00:21:44,433
-No.
-Hey, I'm not saying a word.

239
00:21:44,524 --> 00:21:47,163
I love Irma dearly, I'd never do that to her.

240
00:21:47,244 --> 00:21:48,757
If you say so.

241
00:21:48,964 --> 00:21:52,036
-I do say so.
-Buddy, there's no judgment here.

242
00:21:52,364 --> 00:21:54,832
Whoever the new lady is, I say enjoy it.

243
00:21:55,284 --> 00:21:57,718
-I wish I could trade my wife in.
-You want mine?

244
00:21:57,804 --> 00:21:59,954
She still has a few good miles left.

245
00:22:00,044 --> 00:22:02,114
I'm looking for a newer model.

246
00:22:05,764 --> 00:22:07,675
So what year's your new model, Roy?

247
00:22:07,764 --> 00:22:10,483
-I'm not stepping out on Irma.
-If you say so.

248
00:22:11,324 --> 00:22:13,076
The perfume's mine.

249
00:22:14,004 --> 00:22:17,235
-I put it on this morning.
-What on earth for?

250
00:22:18,044 --> 00:22:19,397
I like it.

251
00:22:25,524 --> 00:22:28,755
I'd never cheat on Irma.
Never in a million years.

252
00:22:29,804 --> 00:22:32,034
Don't ever say that to me again.

253
00:22:35,004 --> 00:22:36,483
What the hell?

254
00:22:47,524 --> 00:22:49,913
-Did you find an apartment?
-Yes.

255
00:22:54,204 --> 00:22:55,557
What's it like?

256
00:22:56,204 --> 00:22:59,435
It's small. One room, kitchenette.

257
00:23:03,004 --> 00:23:04,596
Does it get any sun?

258
00:23:05,204 --> 00:23:08,116
No, but there are things I can do
to cheer it up.

259
00:23:11,644 --> 00:23:14,875
What kind of life
is this going to be for you, Roy?

260
00:23:17,084 --> 00:23:18,597
I don't know.

261
00:23:19,604 --> 00:23:22,072
But I hope you'll still be part of it.

262
00:23:30,644 --> 00:23:32,794
-Are these ready to sign?
-Yeah.

263
00:23:39,884 --> 00:23:42,000
You won't be able to claim...

264
00:23:43,044 --> 00:23:45,035
Patty Ann as a dependent.

265
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:49,683
-I don't see why not, if I'm paying support.
-But you won't be her father.

266
00:23:50,244 --> 00:23:54,237
I'll be her parent,
who still loves her and cares for her.

267
00:24:01,684 --> 00:24:04,437
I sent a letter to Wayne.

268
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:06,917
Are you out of your mind?

269
00:24:07,004 --> 00:24:09,472
He's my son,
and he has a right to know what's what.

270
00:24:09,564 --> 00:24:10,792
Not this!

271
00:24:11,044 --> 00:24:13,717
It had to be done, whether you like it or not.

272
00:24:13,804 --> 00:24:15,522
And it's been done.

273
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:19,958
What if I told you I wouldn't allow you
to see Patty Ann anymore?

274
00:24:25,284 --> 00:24:26,512
What if?

275
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,915
It would break my heart...

276
00:24:30,684 --> 00:24:32,675
more than you could know.

277
00:24:33,964 --> 00:24:35,841
But you'd still do it?

278
00:24:47,524 --> 00:24:49,515
The postage is all there.

279
00:24:51,444 --> 00:24:54,242
Just drop it in the mailbox, okay?

280
00:25:27,124 --> 00:25:30,480
-Let's hear it.
-It might seem a little funny, but it hurts.

281
00:25:33,724 --> 00:25:36,636
I got one. I just got this from my dad.

282
00:25:39,044 --> 00:25:40,841
Get ready to be fucked up.

283
00:25:42,604 --> 00:25:45,516
''Dear Wayne, I'm writing to you
at a frightening...

284
00:25:45,604 --> 00:25:48,402
''and also very exciting crossroads
in my life.''

285
00:25:48,484 --> 00:25:51,840
You guys have to understand the person
who wrote this. This man....

286
00:25:51,924 --> 00:25:54,438
Remember ''man.'' My pop.

287
00:25:54,524 --> 00:25:56,196
He's from the corn belt, okay?

288
00:25:56,284 --> 00:25:59,401
Self-expression and communication,
it's not part of his wiring.

289
00:25:59,484 --> 00:26:02,999
He can't even talk to me on the phone
without a conversational cue sheet.

290
00:26:03,084 --> 00:26:07,316
''Hey, Wayne, how's your van doing?
Is the clutch still jamming?

291
00:26:07,484 --> 00:26:10,317
''What's that band
you're working for, Wayne?

292
00:26:10,404 --> 00:26:12,395
''No, I've never heard of them.''

293
00:26:13,724 --> 00:26:15,316
Everybody's heard of them.

294
00:26:16,404 --> 00:26:17,917
Then I read this letter...

295
00:26:18,004 --> 00:26:21,679
and I'm wondering if it's some bizarre joke
someone's playing on me.

296
00:26:21,764 --> 00:26:24,278
But no, I know for a fact
that this is from my pop.

297
00:26:24,364 --> 00:26:27,640
He's the only person I know
that would write a personal letter...

298
00:26:27,724 --> 00:26:30,557
on his fucking business stationery.

299
00:26:31,484 --> 00:26:32,633
And then listen:

300
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:35,636
''I don't know how to express this
other than in a letter.

301
00:26:35,724 --> 00:26:40,593
''I'm having a surgery next year to correct
a condition known as gender dysphoria.

302
00:26:41,924 --> 00:26:45,712
''In other words,
I'm a woman born in a man's body.

303
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:48,079
''I'll be getting a sex change.

304
00:26:50,964 --> 00:26:52,841
''I hope you understand...

305
00:26:52,924 --> 00:26:56,121
''that I'd like to find
some peace and happiness in my life.

306
00:26:56,204 --> 00:26:58,274
''I'm still your parent, no matter what.

307
00:26:58,364 --> 00:27:01,242
''I will care deeply about you
until the end of my days.

308
00:27:01,324 --> 00:27:03,713
''I love you. Dad.''

309
00:27:04,084 --> 00:27:07,679
What kind of shit is that? ''I love you. Dad.''

310
00:27:18,524 --> 00:27:19,798
Hi, guys.

311
00:27:23,284 --> 00:27:24,797
There she goes.

312
00:27:29,924 --> 00:27:31,198
Hey, Roy.

313
00:27:31,804 --> 00:27:34,443
-Come on in.
-Thanks for seeing me, Frank.

314
00:27:34,524 --> 00:27:36,594
-Sure, have a seat.
-Thank you.

315
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:42,878
I know word has gotten to you
about the perfume.

316
00:27:43,324 --> 00:27:46,077
If I believed
half of what got said around here....

317
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,802
Don't give it another thought.

318
00:27:47,884 --> 00:27:50,682
Well, the fact is, it's true.

319
00:27:51,364 --> 00:27:54,322
And I apologize.
I meant to organize things better.

320
00:27:54,564 --> 00:27:58,443
-I should have talked to you--
-I'm not sure I'm catching your drift.

321
00:28:02,924 --> 00:28:06,200
Well, I have this condition.

322
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:09,037
I'm a female born in a man's body...

323
00:28:09,124 --> 00:28:11,240
and I have to do something about it.

324
00:28:11,404 --> 00:28:15,477
Which is why I'm starting
to take hormones in a couple of weeks...

325
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:19,516
and sometime next year,
I'm going to have the surgery.

326
00:28:21,764 --> 00:28:24,961
Just so as you know,
I'm going to start dressing as a woman...

327
00:28:25,604 --> 00:28:28,482
bit by bit, and I'll do it gradually...

328
00:28:28,564 --> 00:28:32,034
so as not to disrupt the work here.

329
00:28:32,164 --> 00:28:35,076
I know this is a lot to take in...

330
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,353
so I brought you this.

331
00:28:39,004 --> 00:28:40,995
It's useful, I think.

332
00:28:41,084 --> 00:28:43,518
It explains my condition...

333
00:28:44,804 --> 00:28:46,874
and how to talk about it...

334
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:50,078
with the other workers...

335
00:28:51,284 --> 00:28:54,515
and how to handle
when I change my name...

336
00:28:56,244 --> 00:28:59,793
and restroom reassignments, and so forth.

337
00:29:01,764 --> 00:29:03,356
That's good.

338
00:29:11,004 --> 00:29:12,995
Does Irma know about this?

339
00:29:14,284 --> 00:29:15,399
Yeah.

340
00:29:18,844 --> 00:29:20,436
What did she say?

341
00:29:20,804 --> 00:29:22,684
She asked me to leave, which I understand.

342
00:29:22,684 --> 00:29:24,276
She asked me to leave, which I understand.

343
00:29:24,364 --> 00:29:27,561
-She's got a lot to figure out.
-I can imagine.

344
00:29:27,644 --> 00:29:30,954
I know you're going to have to decide
whether to keep me on.

345
00:29:35,924 --> 00:29:38,882
I won't deny that you've put an awful lot
on my plate here.

346
00:29:38,964 --> 00:29:41,432
I just want to say that whatever you decide...

347
00:29:41,524 --> 00:29:43,162
I understand.

348
00:29:44,764 --> 00:29:45,992
Thank you, Roy.

349
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:48,803
Thanks for being so forthright with me.

350
00:29:50,124 --> 00:29:53,400
Thank you for letting me get this out.

351
00:30:15,484 --> 00:30:18,078
-Hi, Irma. How are you?
-Frank! Oh, my God.

352
00:30:18,604 --> 00:30:20,322
-Come in.
-Thanks.

353
00:30:25,564 --> 00:30:27,236
I guess Roy told you.

354
00:30:27,604 --> 00:30:29,242
Yeah, he sure did.

355
00:30:31,044 --> 00:30:32,875
Is he getting help, Irma?

356
00:30:33,284 --> 00:30:35,002
We've been to counselling...

357
00:30:35,404 --> 00:30:37,281
but nothing will change his mind.

358
00:30:37,364 --> 00:30:40,356
You see, he's determined
to go through with this.

359
00:30:40,724 --> 00:30:43,796
We both know Roy is not the type
to act on a whim.

360
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,556
No, he isn't.

361
00:30:46,524 --> 00:30:48,355
Are you going to fire him?

362
00:30:49,564 --> 00:30:51,202
Well, this is the thing.

363
00:30:51,284 --> 00:30:54,754
Roy works with a pretty
meat-and-potatoes kind of crew.

364
00:30:56,044 --> 00:30:58,797
I'd be happy to keep an eye on him.

365
00:30:59,764 --> 00:31:02,642
The truth is, as soon as I turn my back,
they'll take him...

366
00:31:02,724 --> 00:31:04,680
and beat the crap out of him.

367
00:31:05,324 --> 00:31:07,997
I'm sorry, Irma,
I really don't know what else to do.

368
00:31:08,084 --> 00:31:09,676
No, I understand.

369
00:31:11,884 --> 00:31:14,034
How are you fixed for money?

370
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:20,003
The insurance won't cover his treatment...

371
00:31:20,724 --> 00:31:23,682
so it's going to take out a big bite.

372
00:31:25,044 --> 00:31:27,842
I've started looking for work myself.

373
00:31:28,844 --> 00:31:32,473
You know, who knows what Roy
is going to get once he...

374
00:31:35,564 --> 00:31:37,202
switches permanently.

375
00:31:37,884 --> 00:31:39,522
I hear you.

376
00:31:44,284 --> 00:31:45,683
Here's what.

377
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:50,242
Roy is due for a promotion in another year.

378
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:54,356
What if I just hurried him up the ladder
a little bit...

379
00:31:54,804 --> 00:31:56,795
if I found a desk job for him?

380
00:31:57,324 --> 00:31:58,677
You think?

381
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:02,995
You're a good man, Frank.

382
00:32:03,684 --> 00:32:05,561
Tell that to my wife.

383
00:32:07,244 --> 00:32:09,633
Oh, no, she didn't leave you again?

384
00:32:10,564 --> 00:32:13,840
We were getting along just fine there
for a while.

385
00:32:15,444 --> 00:32:17,560
She goes off her medication.

386
00:32:17,764 --> 00:32:20,119
Not much I can do about that.

387
00:32:20,924 --> 00:32:23,358
I'm sorry, you don't deserve that.

388
00:32:23,844 --> 00:32:26,039
Well, that's the way it goes.

389
00:32:53,124 --> 00:32:55,274
It didn't do it for me. You?

390
00:32:56,124 --> 00:32:57,113
No.

391
00:32:59,324 --> 00:33:01,394
Well, it was something to try.

392
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:14,755
Thanks for the coffee, Irma.

393
00:33:15,124 --> 00:33:18,514
Thank you, Frank, for standing behind Roy.

394
00:33:19,444 --> 00:33:21,833
-He's the best we have.
-Yes, he is.

395
00:33:22,684 --> 00:33:25,244
All right, you take care of yourself now.

396
00:34:44,724 --> 00:34:46,237
I'll take these, too.

397
00:36:32,964 --> 00:36:34,875
Take those goddamn things off.

398
00:36:36,724 --> 00:36:38,919
Mind your own goddamn business.

399
00:36:41,964 --> 00:36:43,238
Give them to me.

400
00:36:47,484 --> 00:36:48,917
Hey, what's going on?

401
00:36:49,684 --> 00:36:51,640
Give me them. Give them to me.

402
00:36:58,044 --> 00:36:59,318
Get him off!

403
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:07,803
Let go of him!

404
00:37:08,804 --> 00:37:11,955
Christ! It's just a shitty pair of earrings.

405
00:37:14,164 --> 00:37:15,392
Freak.

406
00:37:18,324 --> 00:37:20,360
You were asking for that.

407
00:37:24,444 --> 00:37:26,878
-Just be glad he's not dancing.
-Move!

408
00:38:24,724 --> 00:38:29,115
To hear the lark as he's taking flight

409
00:38:29,204 --> 00:38:33,834
As he soars into the sky

410
00:38:34,044 --> 00:38:38,879
If you listen close, you can hear him now

411
00:38:43,644 --> 00:38:47,842
And he soars across the valleys

412
00:38:48,044 --> 00:38:52,242
And he lives in open plains

413
00:38:52,524 --> 00:38:57,075
And he lives right here inside your heart

414
00:38:57,244 --> 00:39:01,396
As he lives in everything

415
00:39:01,524 --> 00:39:06,040
And he lives right here inside your heart

416
00:39:06,124 --> 00:39:09,753
As he lives in everything

417
00:39:30,644 --> 00:39:34,762
As he soars into the sky

418
00:39:36,444 --> 00:39:39,163
If you listen close

419
00:39:39,244 --> 00:39:42,316
You will hear him there

420
00:39:44,004 --> 00:39:48,520
As he lives in everything

421
00:39:50,364 --> 00:39:55,358
As he lives in open valleys

422
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:57,800
Stop. Guys, sit down.

423
00:39:58,204 --> 00:40:00,399
Girls, I don't like what I'm hearing.

424
00:40:00,484 --> 00:40:03,078
Please. Pay attention to the dynamics.

425
00:40:05,844 --> 00:40:10,520
As he lives in open valleys

426
00:40:11,484 --> 00:40:16,035
As he soars across the plains

427
00:40:17,684 --> 00:40:20,596
And he lives right here

428
00:40:20,684 --> 00:40:25,155
inside your heart

429
00:40:26,244 --> 00:40:29,156
As he lives in

430
00:40:29,244 --> 00:40:33,476
everything

431
00:40:34,804 --> 00:40:37,443
As he lives in

432
00:40:37,524 --> 00:40:41,483
everything

433
00:41:10,844 --> 00:41:12,436
I've brought your mail.

434
00:41:13,564 --> 00:41:15,043
Thanks.

435
00:41:16,164 --> 00:41:18,155
What happened to your forehead?

436
00:41:18,644 --> 00:41:21,078
I wore some earrings to work.

437
00:41:22,484 --> 00:41:24,156
That wasn't too smart.

438
00:41:26,204 --> 00:41:27,956
Made me feel pretty.

439
00:41:30,924 --> 00:41:32,562
Do you want an aspirin?

440
00:41:33,164 --> 00:41:34,995
Yeah, I could use one.

441
00:41:41,244 --> 00:41:44,156
-You want to get in the truck?
-No. I'm fine here.

442
00:41:48,484 --> 00:41:50,634
There's a letter from your mother.

443
00:41:53,324 --> 00:41:55,280
I'm out of the choir, by the way.

444
00:41:56,604 --> 00:42:00,233
Sorry to hear that, Roy.
You would've made a fine soprano.

445
00:42:08,764 --> 00:42:10,356
What does it say?

446
00:42:11,084 --> 00:42:13,917
''Dear Roy, I got your letter today.

447
00:42:14,124 --> 00:42:15,523
''As you know...

448
00:42:15,884 --> 00:42:18,796
''your father has been
on a long, slow decline.

449
00:42:19,444 --> 00:42:21,514
''He's had a hard life, and I want him...

450
00:42:21,604 --> 00:42:24,801
''to be able to spend the time he has left
in peace.

451
00:42:29,364 --> 00:42:32,276
''So I've decided not to show him your letter.

452
00:42:34,524 --> 00:42:38,563
''By the way, we're having your father's
birthday celebration on Saturday.

453
00:42:38,644 --> 00:42:42,523
''I'm serving supper at 3:00.
Tell Irma to bring her beans.''

454
00:42:42,604 --> 00:42:45,357
I forgot all about it. Do you want to go?

455
00:42:49,124 --> 00:42:52,116
It's probably the last time
you're going to see him.

456
00:42:52,404 --> 00:42:53,883
Hello, folks!

457
00:42:55,044 --> 00:42:57,035
Glad to see you two talking.

458
00:42:57,124 --> 00:43:00,082
Listen, not to disturb you,
I just wanted to give you these.

459
00:43:00,164 --> 00:43:04,043
I went online and found an excellent site
on gender issues.

460
00:43:04,124 --> 00:43:07,560
It's Baptist-based,
but the general principles are still the same.

461
00:43:07,644 --> 00:43:10,522
Here you go. I made copies for each of you.

462
00:43:11,564 --> 00:43:15,644
And I just want to say again how sorry I am
about this whole business with the choir.

463
00:43:15,644 --> 00:43:16,360
And I just want to say again how sorry I am
about this whole business with the choir.

464
00:43:16,764 --> 00:43:19,801
Irma, as I told Roy, if it was just up to me....

465
00:43:20,324 --> 00:43:21,473
But....

466
00:43:22,004 --> 00:43:24,472
I'm still in the ring with you two.

467
00:43:24,724 --> 00:43:27,079
Roy, we need to make an appointment.

468
00:43:27,164 --> 00:43:30,236
-We'll see.
-Well, good night, folks.

469
00:43:34,764 --> 00:43:35,879
Here.

470
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:40,356
Irma, it's cold. You want to get in the truck?

471
00:43:59,604 --> 00:44:01,322
-Roy.
-Yeah?

472
00:44:03,324 --> 00:44:05,554
I keep trying to figure out...

473
00:44:07,644 --> 00:44:09,441
what I've done wrong.

474
00:44:09,924 --> 00:44:12,563
You haven't done anything wrong.

475
00:44:14,804 --> 00:44:16,522
Then don't do this.

476
00:44:17,884 --> 00:44:19,203
Oh, honey.

477
00:44:20,444 --> 00:44:22,958
I have been sharing a bed with you...

478
00:44:23,524 --> 00:44:25,276
for 25 years.

479
00:44:26,244 --> 00:44:27,882
I know your body.

480
00:44:28,444 --> 00:44:30,116
I know your smell.

481
00:44:31,404 --> 00:44:32,883
You're a man.

482
00:44:33,324 --> 00:44:35,076
That's what you are.

483
00:44:35,484 --> 00:44:38,920
Don't try telling me
that you're something else.

484
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:41,118
But I am.

485
00:44:42,164 --> 00:44:43,199
No!

486
00:44:52,444 --> 00:44:53,923
There you are.

487
00:44:57,964 --> 00:45:02,196
-Why won't you let me touch you?
-Because it doesn't feel like part of me.

488
00:45:08,524 --> 00:45:11,675
I'm just trying to explain
what it's like for me.

489
00:45:13,884 --> 00:45:16,034
I have to get home to Patty.

490
00:45:16,844 --> 00:45:21,156
-We have to sit down and talk to her.
-Let's get through the weekend.

491
00:45:22,124 --> 00:45:24,160
We'll see you on Saturday.

492
00:45:47,404 --> 00:45:49,042
Clean up them plugs.

493
00:45:49,244 --> 00:45:52,316
-You got a brand-new tractor.
-Needs a tune-up.

494
00:45:53,124 --> 00:45:54,352
-Hey, Roy.
-Hey, Don.

495
00:45:54,444 --> 00:45:56,036
-Hey, Irma.
-Hi, Don.

496
00:45:56,604 --> 00:45:58,037
Hi, Aunt Becky.

497
00:46:05,364 --> 00:46:07,355
-Hello, Gary. Hi, Mike.
-Hello.

498
00:46:13,364 --> 00:46:15,832
-Here they are. How are you?
-Hi.

499
00:46:15,924 --> 00:46:17,915
-Hi, sweetie.
-Here she is.

500
00:46:20,644 --> 00:46:23,033
Come on in, honey.
Let me take those things.

501
00:46:23,124 --> 00:46:25,638
There you go. Here, I'll take those.

502
00:46:29,044 --> 00:46:31,922
Happy birthday to you

503
00:46:32,284 --> 00:46:35,356
Happy birthday to you

504
00:46:35,644 --> 00:46:39,353
Happy birthday, dear Dad

505
00:46:39,644 --> 00:46:42,795
Happy birthday to you

506
00:46:42,884 --> 00:46:44,715
Blow out the candles, Roy.

507
00:46:44,804 --> 00:46:48,558
-It's chocolate. I didn't want chocolate.
-That's what you asked for.

508
00:46:48,644 --> 00:46:50,396
-No, I didn't.
-Honey, you did.

509
00:46:50,484 --> 00:46:53,521
-I did not, godammit it!
-Yes, you did, Dad. I heard you say it.

510
00:46:53,604 --> 00:46:56,835
What do you know about cakes?
Never seen you bake one before.

511
00:46:56,924 --> 00:47:00,234
-Roy, leave Becky alone.
-She needs to leave me alone.

512
00:47:00,324 --> 00:47:03,202
She can't wait till I die,
so she can have the farm.

513
00:47:03,284 --> 00:47:05,923
My son hasn't got the spine
to fight her for it.

514
00:47:06,004 --> 00:47:07,835
Dad, I don't want the farm.

515
00:47:07,924 --> 00:47:09,994
Don't get me started on you.

516
00:47:10,124 --> 00:47:12,592
I had to go through all these girls
to get you...

517
00:47:12,684 --> 00:47:17,155
and you turn out to be a hopeless case,
moping around like a sissy.

518
00:47:17,244 --> 00:47:20,600
I didn't mope around.
You didn't give me time to mope around.

519
00:47:20,684 --> 00:47:22,242
That's right.

520
00:47:22,404 --> 00:47:26,283
If I hadn't straightened you out,
you'd still be a big cry-baby.

521
00:47:27,164 --> 00:47:31,203
Did I ever tell you about the time
I caught him in his sister's clothes?

522
00:47:31,564 --> 00:47:35,637
I made him strip down
and spend the night in the barn, naked.

523
00:47:36,484 --> 00:47:39,920
-Blow out the candles!
-Come on, make a wish for yourself.

524
00:47:40,284 --> 00:47:42,161
Good Christ, is he crying?

525
00:47:42,244 --> 00:47:45,077
Roy, the candles are about to melt
all over the cake.

526
00:47:45,164 --> 00:47:48,520
Come over and help your grandpa
blow out the candles.

527
00:47:49,564 --> 00:47:52,397
See, the cake looks delicious.
Did you make it yourself?

528
00:47:52,484 --> 00:47:55,920
No, it's from a mix,
but I added an extra egg to make it moist.

529
00:47:56,004 --> 00:47:58,643
I always add another egg.

530
00:48:02,444 --> 00:48:03,843
Where's she going?

531
00:48:07,804 --> 00:48:10,443
I'm thinking about switching over
to narrow-row corn.

532
00:48:13,004 --> 00:48:14,995
Yeah, I think it's a good idea.

533
00:48:18,404 --> 00:48:20,872
-Where the hell is he going?
-Leave him be.

534
00:48:21,924 --> 00:48:23,915
Irma, do you want some cake?

535
00:48:27,044 --> 00:48:28,193
No.

536
00:48:29,884 --> 00:48:31,875
I think I'll wait a while.

537
00:48:32,804 --> 00:48:34,795
I'm going to start on the dishes.

538
00:48:34,884 --> 00:48:38,194
Patty Ann, why don't you
come in the kitchen and help me?

539
00:48:41,764 --> 00:48:45,074
-Mom, it just looks fabulous.
-Thanks.

540
00:48:45,444 --> 00:48:48,481
You both better be ready.
I'm ready to kill some fishes.

541
00:48:49,124 --> 00:48:50,239
Got my name on them.

542
00:48:50,324 --> 00:48:52,838
-You seen Roy?
-No, haven't seen him.

543
00:48:53,004 --> 00:48:54,722
I haven't seen him, Irma.

544
00:48:55,844 --> 00:48:59,154
Honey, just wait here, okay?
I'll see if I can find your dad.

545
00:48:59,244 --> 00:49:01,838
Come here, sweetie.
Tell your uncle some lies.

546
00:49:01,924 --> 00:49:04,392
You got more food in there for me?

547
00:49:04,684 --> 00:49:07,676
-It's empty.
-Empty? Go get me some take-home.

548
00:49:46,644 --> 00:49:48,521
Put the gun down, Roy.

549
00:49:57,644 --> 00:49:58,633
Please.

550
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:04,993
I think for now you should come home.

551
00:51:53,804 --> 00:51:55,999
Are you going to grow your hair out?

552
00:51:56,524 --> 00:51:57,593
Yes.

553
00:51:59,044 --> 00:52:01,842
-Will you be just as tall?
-Yes.

554
00:52:04,804 --> 00:52:06,920
-Is your voice going to change?
-No.

555
00:52:08,484 --> 00:52:10,998
So what will you do? Will you speak higher?

556
00:52:12,084 --> 00:52:13,312
I suppose so.

557
00:52:14,604 --> 00:52:15,444
Do it.

558
00:52:20,964 --> 00:52:23,273
How big are your boobs supposed to get?

559
00:52:24,364 --> 00:52:26,514
Well, my doctor says they're going to be...

560
00:52:26,604 --> 00:52:30,597
one or two cups smaller
than my mother's, your grandma Em's.

561
00:52:31,004 --> 00:52:33,518
My God! Her breasts are huge.

562
00:52:37,844 --> 00:52:39,960
Are you going to shave your legs?

563
00:52:41,644 --> 00:52:43,475
And under your arms?

564
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:47,441
-What about your bikini line?
-My bikini line?

565
00:52:47,844 --> 00:52:50,677
So your pubes don't show
when you wear a swimsuit.

566
00:52:51,524 --> 00:52:54,163
What about your beard?
Will that go away, too?

567
00:52:54,244 --> 00:52:56,963
No, I've got to have that removed
with electrolysis.

568
00:52:57,844 --> 00:53:00,836
-That's supposed to be really painful.
-That's what I hear.

569
00:53:00,924 --> 00:53:02,596
-Does it scare you?
-No.

570
00:53:03,564 --> 00:53:05,441
Does the operation scare you?

571
00:53:11,604 --> 00:53:14,038
What about Wayne?
Does he know about this?

572
00:53:14,244 --> 00:53:15,882
Well, I wrote him a letter.

573
00:53:15,964 --> 00:53:17,920
-Did he write back?
-No, not yet.

574
00:53:19,204 --> 00:53:21,479
You know, Patty, whatever you're feeling...

575
00:53:21,564 --> 00:53:24,397
I mean, if you're angry
at your father or at me...

576
00:53:24,724 --> 00:53:26,680
it's completely understandable.

577
00:53:28,244 --> 00:53:29,518
I'm not angry.

578
00:53:30,164 --> 00:53:31,597
I think it's cool.

579
00:53:33,604 --> 00:53:37,597
The kids at school might start saying
some real cruel things to you.

580
00:53:38,644 --> 00:53:40,839
So? They do anyway.

581
00:53:44,644 --> 00:53:47,317
-So does this let me off the hook?
-What do you mean?

582
00:53:47,404 --> 00:53:49,599
Of having to be the girl of the family.

583
00:53:49,804 --> 00:53:51,362
Patty, you are a girl.

584
00:53:51,924 --> 00:53:56,236
See? She's always on my case about it.
I can't do it. I'm just not that type.

585
00:53:57,924 --> 00:53:59,516
It sucks being a woman.

586
00:53:59,644 --> 00:54:03,478
You'll spend the rest of your life
getting shafted. You'll be out of the club.

587
00:54:03,964 --> 00:54:07,400
Why do you want to give that all up?
It's easier being a man.

588
00:54:07,484 --> 00:54:11,523
It isn't easier being a man. Men die first.
That should give you a clue.

589
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:17,994
-And you'll probably start getting zits.
-Oh, I see.

590
00:54:19,044 --> 00:54:20,762
What should I do about it?

591
00:54:22,924 --> 00:54:24,721
There's nothing you can do.

592
00:54:25,244 --> 00:54:26,518
It's hopeless.

593
00:54:27,004 --> 00:54:28,915
Sorry, Dad, but it's hopeless.

594
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:20,840
-Patty Ann, you want some eggs?
-No, they make me nauseous.

595
00:55:20,924 --> 00:55:24,519
-Then have some cornflakes.
-I don't like the texture.

596
00:55:24,604 --> 00:55:26,720
You're just too precious to live.

597
00:55:27,604 --> 00:55:28,957
This cream is bad.

598
00:55:29,044 --> 00:55:31,160
-It's fine.
-No, it isn't.

599
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:33,474
-I just got it yesterday.
-Smell it.

600
00:55:33,964 --> 00:55:36,034
-It smells fine.
-It's sour.

601
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:36,164
-Did you check the date?
-Yes, Roy, I checked the date.

602
00:55:36,164 --> 00:55:39,201
-Did you check the date?
-Yes, Roy, I checked the date.

603
00:55:39,324 --> 00:55:41,519
Mom, quit making that noise with the toast.

604
00:55:41,604 --> 00:55:44,038
-I want you to eat something.
-I'm not hungry.

605
00:55:44,124 --> 00:55:46,558
You can't go to school
on an empty stomach.

606
00:55:46,764 --> 00:55:48,755
-Patty, want some oatmeal?
-No.

607
00:55:48,844 --> 00:55:50,323
-I'm making some.
-So?

608
00:55:50,404 --> 00:55:52,315
-What are you doing?
-I'm making oatmeal.

609
00:55:52,404 --> 00:55:55,680
-Let me do it. You'll burn the pot.
-I'm just boiling water.

610
00:55:55,764 --> 00:55:57,197
Let me do it. It'll take a minute.

611
00:55:57,284 --> 00:55:59,673
-Why are you being so snippy?
-I'm not being snippy.

612
00:55:59,764 --> 00:56:03,154
-Yes, you are.
-I'm not. You're the one that's being snippy.

613
00:56:03,244 --> 00:56:06,600
-Can I get another ear piercing?
-You're pretty enough as it is.

614
00:56:06,684 --> 00:56:08,754
I wasn't talking to you,
I was talking to Mom.

615
00:56:08,844 --> 00:56:11,836
I was talking to you. You need to learn
some manners, young lady.

616
00:56:11,924 --> 00:56:15,553
-You need to learn to leave me alone.
-All right, that's it. Get out. Go on.

617
00:56:15,644 --> 00:56:18,238
Walk away. I'm making you oatmeal.

618
00:56:18,324 --> 00:56:20,554
-I don't want any.
-That's too bad.

619
00:56:23,484 --> 00:56:25,156
-What are you looking for?
-Grapefruit.

620
00:56:25,244 --> 00:56:27,041
I thought you were having oatmeal.

621
00:56:27,124 --> 00:56:31,083
I'm having a grapefruit with my oatmeal.
Is there anything wrong with that?

622
00:56:31,164 --> 00:56:33,962
-Let me find it.
-Just tell me where it is.

623
00:56:34,044 --> 00:56:37,514
Roy, if you'd please just sit down,
I'd have everything ready in--

624
00:56:37,604 --> 00:56:40,402
Why don't I do the grapefruit?
And you can do the....

625
00:56:40,484 --> 00:56:44,636
-Don't get annoyed. I'm just trying to help.
-I don't want help.

626
00:56:44,724 --> 00:56:47,841
It would be so much easier
if you just sat down and let me do it.

627
00:56:47,924 --> 00:56:49,277
In the time we discussed this...

628
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:51,924
I could have made my breakfast
and gone to work already.

629
00:56:52,004 --> 00:56:54,916
Here, Dad. Eat the freaking grapefruit.

630
00:56:57,324 --> 00:56:58,803
That was pleasant.

631
00:57:01,564 --> 00:57:03,236
Your oatmeal, Roy.

632
00:57:23,044 --> 00:57:24,716
Irma, you still there?

633
00:57:28,124 --> 00:57:29,113
Yes.

634
00:57:34,164 --> 00:57:35,563
I'm going to come out now.

635
00:57:39,804 --> 00:57:40,873
All right.

636
00:58:02,764 --> 00:58:04,117
What do you think?

637
00:58:09,244 --> 00:58:10,518
What can I say?

638
00:58:12,684 --> 00:58:15,118
You look like my aunt Norma
after her stroke.

639
00:58:16,404 --> 00:58:18,281
-Do I look that awful?
-Yeah.

640
00:58:21,324 --> 00:58:22,677
Yes, honey, you do.

641
00:58:25,964 --> 00:58:28,114
I've been going to thrift stores...

642
00:58:29,204 --> 00:58:31,877
and grabbing whatever looks right
and hope it fits.

643
00:58:33,324 --> 00:58:36,122
This dress is so musty, it makes me itch.

644
00:58:38,244 --> 00:58:39,757
Poor Roy.

645
00:58:41,364 --> 00:58:45,915
I need your help to order some decent stuff.

646
00:58:46,004 --> 00:58:48,916
I folded down the page with things I liked.

647
00:58:50,564 --> 00:58:51,713
All right.

648
00:58:57,644 --> 00:59:00,875
You gave yourself boobs.
What did you use, Kleenex?

649
00:59:01,564 --> 00:59:02,713
Bubble wrap.

650
00:59:04,284 --> 00:59:06,752
You got the shape all wrong.

651
00:59:08,324 --> 00:59:10,963
So, what am I supposed
to be looking at here?

652
00:59:16,004 --> 00:59:17,278
The blouse.

653
00:59:18,164 --> 00:59:20,962
-Oh, no. It's not right for you.
-Why not?

654
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:25,512
Well, it's too ruffly.
I mean, it will accentuate your shoulders.

655
00:59:27,044 --> 00:59:29,797
You need something more tailored
that'll slim you down.

656
00:59:29,884 --> 00:59:33,240
I don't want to wear anything tailored.
I've been wearing tailored--

657
00:59:33,324 --> 00:59:35,076
You know, you'll look top heavy.

658
00:59:35,764 --> 00:59:37,880
You've got to work with what you've got.

659
00:59:38,124 --> 00:59:40,684
We all do. You know...

660
00:59:40,764 --> 00:59:43,881
I wish I had the legs
so I could wear short skirts, but--

661
00:59:43,964 --> 00:59:46,114
-Your legs are beautiful.
-No, they're not.

662
00:59:46,204 --> 00:59:48,638
-I love your legs.
-Don't.

663
00:59:50,244 --> 00:59:51,802
Mom.

664
00:59:52,284 --> 00:59:54,593
Wait a minute, Patty Ann.

665
00:59:55,604 --> 00:59:56,832
Don't come in.

666
00:59:57,084 --> 00:59:58,597
What are you doing?

667
00:59:59,124 --> 01:00:00,318
Never mind.

668
01:00:00,404 --> 01:00:02,440
-Is Daddy in drag?
-No.

669
01:00:02,564 --> 01:00:05,032
-Can I see?
-No. Now, what do you want?

670
01:00:05,124 --> 01:00:07,684
Tell me if I can wear this shirt without a bra.

671
01:00:07,764 --> 01:00:10,676
Patty Ann, you can't go without a bra.
You're too developed.

672
01:00:10,764 --> 01:00:12,163
Nothing shows.

673
01:00:16,684 --> 01:00:18,083
Where'd you get that?

674
01:00:18,684 --> 01:00:21,596
-It's Dad's. He said I could have it.
-It's too big.

675
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:23,802
No, it's not. It's the look.

676
01:00:23,924 --> 01:00:27,234
Well, go take it off, please.
And put your bra back on.

677
01:00:27,644 --> 01:00:29,521
I hate wearing a bra.

678
01:00:30,004 --> 01:00:33,599
-It makes marks on my skin.
-Then go live in a jungle, honey.

679
01:00:37,524 --> 01:00:39,640
Why did you give her your shirt?

680
01:00:40,084 --> 01:00:42,154
I thought she could use it.

681
01:00:42,884 --> 01:00:46,354
I don't think it's appropriate.
She's boyish enough as it is.

682
01:00:46,444 --> 01:00:49,322
-What if she is?
-Roy, she's going to get hurt.

683
01:00:49,684 --> 01:00:51,436
The kids will tear her apart.

684
01:00:51,604 --> 01:00:54,835
For now, please,
just don't encourage it, okay?

685
01:00:54,924 --> 01:00:57,802
-Just let her try to blend in.
-All right.

686
01:00:58,444 --> 01:01:00,719
So what else did you want me to look at?

687
01:01:02,404 --> 01:01:04,679
-Never mind. I know what I'm getting.
-What?

688
01:01:04,764 --> 01:01:07,642
I think you should run it by me first.
We're on a budget.

689
01:01:07,724 --> 01:01:09,476
I'm very aware we're on a budget.

690
01:01:09,564 --> 01:01:12,032
Yeah, well, I don't think you should...

691
01:01:12,124 --> 01:01:15,161
go order a bunch of things
that don't look good on you.

692
01:01:15,244 --> 01:01:19,123
Thank you, but I don't need you to tell me
what I can and can't wear.

693
01:01:19,204 --> 01:01:21,798
Oh, yes, I think you do.
You don't have a clue.

694
01:01:21,884 --> 01:01:25,559
I'm not in love with everything
I've seen you in. I try not to say anything.

695
01:01:25,644 --> 01:01:29,523
Excuse me, you come out here
with that horrible wig and make-up...

696
01:01:29,604 --> 01:01:31,356
looking like some aging hooker--

697
01:01:31,444 --> 01:01:34,834
I've been sneaking to thrift shops,
for God's sake.

698
01:01:34,924 --> 01:01:37,677
What should I look like?
Like I came from a garden club?

699
01:01:37,764 --> 01:01:38,753
Look, Roy...

700
01:01:39,124 --> 01:01:41,877
you give me a catalogue,
you ask for my opinion...

701
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:44,080
and then get angry when I give it to you.

702
01:01:44,164 --> 01:01:45,961
You weren't just giving an opinion.

703
01:01:46,044 --> 01:01:48,080
-You were setting down rules.
-Stop.

704
01:01:48,164 --> 01:01:51,084
I don't appreciate these mean,
nasty comments you're making.

705
01:01:51,204 --> 01:01:52,353
Just stop.

706
01:01:52,444 --> 01:01:55,117
I had a reaction. I'm human.
What do you want from me?

707
01:01:55,284 --> 01:01:57,275
I just want some respect.

708
01:02:02,684 --> 01:02:04,322
I have given you my youth.

709
01:02:05,404 --> 01:02:07,520
I have given you your children.

710
01:02:08,684 --> 01:02:12,518
I have given you my full
and undivided attention...

711
01:02:12,844 --> 01:02:14,323
for 25 years.

712
01:02:15,604 --> 01:02:17,674
And now, I'm giving up everything...

713
01:02:18,484 --> 01:02:19,758
that I believe in...

714
01:02:20,484 --> 01:02:22,122
so you can feel complete.

715
01:02:24,724 --> 01:02:25,918
So tell me...

716
01:02:26,884 --> 01:02:29,159
what more could you
possibly want from me?

717
01:02:31,364 --> 01:02:32,683
Is that how it feels?

718
01:02:33,364 --> 01:02:34,353
Yes.

719
01:02:35,764 --> 01:02:37,243
How awful.

720
01:02:38,404 --> 01:02:39,996
No, it's not awful, Roy.

721
01:02:40,804 --> 01:02:41,919
It's what it is.

722
01:02:43,724 --> 01:02:45,635
And if I look at it hard enough...

723
01:02:48,684 --> 01:02:50,356
you've done the same for me.

724
01:02:52,404 --> 01:02:53,393
So now...

725
01:02:54,084 --> 01:02:57,713
give me the catalogues,
because I'm going to pick out your clothes.

726
01:03:08,844 --> 01:03:11,722
In jubilation

727
01:03:11,884 --> 01:03:14,956
Sing to the Lord

728
01:03:15,164 --> 01:03:17,553
Come rejoice

729
01:03:17,644 --> 01:03:20,636
Sing hallelujah

730
01:03:21,564 --> 01:03:23,441
Come add your voice

731
01:03:23,524 --> 01:03:26,755
and sing hallelujah

732
01:03:27,924 --> 01:03:30,518
Praise his name

733
01:03:30,604 --> 01:03:33,676
Sing for the Lord

734
01:03:34,324 --> 01:03:38,237
Sing hallelujah

735
01:03:39,484 --> 01:03:43,033
For He lights the way

736
01:03:43,124 --> 01:03:46,116
Rejoice today

737
01:03:46,804 --> 01:03:51,753
Let your heart sing his love

738
01:03:53,164 --> 01:03:55,837
Come rejoice

739
01:03:55,924 --> 01:03:58,961
Sing hallelujah

740
01:04:00,044 --> 01:04:01,955
Come add your voice

741
01:04:02,044 --> 01:04:05,320
and sing hallelujah

742
01:04:06,404 --> 01:04:08,759
Praise His name

743
01:04:08,844 --> 01:04:11,995
Sing for the Lord

744
01:04:12,564 --> 01:04:16,716
Sing hallelujah

745
01:04:17,844 --> 01:04:21,234
For He lights the way

746
01:04:21,324 --> 01:04:24,521
Rejoice today

747
01:04:25,164 --> 01:04:30,113
Let your heart sing his love

748
01:04:31,804 --> 01:04:33,954
Come rejoice

749
01:04:34,044 --> 01:04:37,116
Sing hallelujah

750
01:04:37,924 --> 01:04:40,392
Come add your voice

751
01:04:40,524 --> 01:04:45,473
and sing hallelujah

752
01:05:11,724 --> 01:05:15,273
We're having problems with Roy.
You have to talk to him, Irma.

753
01:05:16,124 --> 01:05:19,673
-Why? What's going on?
-He's getting bitchy.

754
01:05:20,604 --> 01:05:22,196
It's the hormones.

755
01:05:22,284 --> 01:05:26,323
-I understand that, but that's still no excuse.
-No, of course not.

756
01:05:27,604 --> 01:05:31,153
The thing about Roy is,
he was always such an easy-going guy....

757
01:05:35,204 --> 01:05:39,163
I mean, now he's just so super-sensitive
about everything.

758
01:05:39,804 --> 01:05:41,681
Yeah, I'll talk to him.

759
01:05:42,524 --> 01:05:44,515
Janeane's the same way.

760
01:05:44,804 --> 01:05:46,795
She's always backing me into corners.

761
01:05:46,884 --> 01:05:50,001
I say something, she twists it
and turns it into something else.

762
01:05:50,084 --> 01:05:52,234
What am I supposed to do about that?

763
01:05:52,324 --> 01:05:55,680
-Just walk away.
-But then she says I'm ignoring her.

764
01:05:56,684 --> 01:05:59,118
My mom's the same way. So is my sister.

765
01:05:59,364 --> 01:06:01,924
Seems like every woman I know is nuts.

766
01:06:02,204 --> 01:06:04,843
And then I get to know you a little better...

767
01:06:05,524 --> 01:06:07,242
and I see there's hope.

768
01:06:09,044 --> 01:06:12,639
I know that Roy and I
have a great deal of respect for each other.

769
01:06:13,684 --> 01:06:17,154
And I figure that
once he goes through his change, he'll be...

770
01:06:17,484 --> 01:06:20,203
moving on to other pastures, I suppose.

771
01:06:20,924 --> 01:06:23,836
Just want to put the idea out there.

772
01:06:29,964 --> 01:06:32,034
Thanks for dropping by.

773
01:06:33,924 --> 01:06:37,963
No, I will have that talk with Roy.

774
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:39,836
-I'd appreciate that.
-Okay.

775
01:06:39,924 --> 01:06:42,438
-Thanks for the coffee.
-You bet, anytime.

776
01:06:48,724 --> 01:06:50,316
Frank came by today.

777
01:06:52,884 --> 01:06:55,193
He's concerned about your attitude at work.

778
01:06:55,284 --> 01:06:57,161
He says you've gotten bitchy.

779
01:06:57,804 --> 01:06:59,840
-He used that word?
-Yes, he did.

780
01:06:59,924 --> 01:07:01,323
That's just Frank.

781
01:07:01,644 --> 01:07:05,193
He thinks that all the women in the office
are out to get him.

782
01:07:05,724 --> 01:07:09,194
Don't push it with him, Roy.
You're lucky you still have a job.

783
01:07:14,644 --> 01:07:15,963
Do you hear me?

784
01:07:21,404 --> 01:07:22,883
What are you doing?

785
01:07:41,844 --> 01:07:43,562
Well, there they are.

786
01:07:45,964 --> 01:07:48,524
I had no idea they were so sensitive.

787
01:07:50,964 --> 01:07:51,999
Now you know.

788
01:07:52,084 --> 01:07:54,962
And it's not just there, it's everywhere.

789
01:07:55,044 --> 01:07:56,762
I feel like whole...

790
01:07:57,844 --> 01:08:02,793
armies of nerve endings
are budding up all over my skin.

791
01:08:07,284 --> 01:08:10,196
Did I ever kiss you
in the crook of your elbow?

792
01:08:11,084 --> 01:08:12,597
I don't believe so.

793
01:08:15,324 --> 01:08:16,598
I think...

794
01:08:18,324 --> 01:08:21,236
I finally realized what it would take...

795
01:08:22,004 --> 01:08:23,835
to be a proper lover to you.

796
01:08:25,164 --> 01:08:27,280
I'm glad to hear that, Roy.

797
01:08:27,364 --> 01:08:31,403
But it might have been easier for both of us
if you had just read a book.

798
01:08:40,444 --> 01:08:43,083
-Can I ask you something?
-Yeah.

799
01:08:45,364 --> 01:08:47,753
Are you going to want to be with men?

800
01:08:48,324 --> 01:08:51,043
No, honey. You know I don't.

801
01:08:54,444 --> 01:08:57,481
Then, if you're not
planning on having intercourse...

802
01:08:58,484 --> 01:09:00,475
what do you need a vagina for?

803
01:09:03,124 --> 01:09:06,480
-That's a ridiculous question.
-No, it isn't.

804
01:09:08,164 --> 01:09:10,598
I mean, I had babies with mine.

805
01:09:11,364 --> 01:09:13,559
I used it to make love to you.

806
01:09:14,044 --> 01:09:16,763
What on earth
are you going to do with yours?

807
01:09:19,564 --> 01:09:22,237
It's not a matter of
what I'm going to do with it.

808
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:24,838
I'm doing this to make myself complete.

809
01:09:25,204 --> 01:09:29,959
It's a sexual organ, honey.
That's what it's made for.

810
01:09:31,204 --> 01:09:33,923
And as a long-time female, let me tell you...

811
01:09:34,004 --> 01:09:38,759
I haven't used mine for anything
but to take in a penis, okay?

812
01:09:41,364 --> 01:09:44,037
There are certainly other things
you can do with it.

813
01:09:44,124 --> 01:09:45,193
Like what?

814
01:09:46,204 --> 01:09:47,796
You ever masturbated?

815
01:09:49,764 --> 01:09:52,562
-Well, haven't you?
-Good grief, Roy.

816
01:10:00,684 --> 01:10:01,673
What?

817
01:10:03,724 --> 01:10:07,797
If you need to have an affair, I understand.

818
01:10:11,364 --> 01:10:13,320
Don't be ridiculous, Roy.

819
01:10:14,764 --> 01:10:16,163
I wouldn't mind.

820
01:10:17,484 --> 01:10:19,554
Really, Irma, I wouldn't mind.

821
01:10:36,444 --> 01:10:37,797
Hello, Frank.

822
01:10:43,124 --> 01:10:47,754
I just want you to know that I have nothing
but the greatest respect for you.

823
01:10:50,484 --> 01:10:51,553
Thank you.

824
01:10:54,404 --> 01:10:55,996
I respect you, too.

825
01:10:57,604 --> 01:10:59,401
That means a lot to me.

826
01:11:02,804 --> 01:11:03,919
Okay, then.

827
01:11:15,364 --> 01:11:18,037
-That's something.
-Yeah.

828
01:11:21,644 --> 01:11:22,633
Right.

829
01:11:29,924 --> 01:11:32,074
I like the feel of your hand.

830
01:11:33,684 --> 01:11:37,472
-Roy's are going so soft.
-Yeah, I noticed that.

831
01:11:39,844 --> 01:11:43,393
He used to have such strong hands.

832
01:11:45,284 --> 01:11:48,321
That was one of the things
I first loved about him.

833
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:52,035
I liked the feel of his calluses
when we held hands.

834
01:11:53,404 --> 01:11:55,713
Janeane makes me buff mine down.

835
01:11:56,404 --> 01:11:59,999
She prefers a smoother hand.

836
01:12:01,004 --> 01:12:03,837
I like a man to have a few rough edges.

837
01:12:05,044 --> 01:12:06,682
Well, that's me.

838
01:12:09,084 --> 01:12:11,996
For a fair-haired guy,
my stubble grows in pretty thick.

839
01:12:12,084 --> 01:12:13,403
Yeah, feel.

840
01:12:23,884 --> 01:12:26,796
-Roy can grow a pretty good beard.
-Really?

841
01:12:29,284 --> 01:12:31,240
He grew one, one winter.

842
01:12:33,164 --> 01:12:34,961
But then he shaved it off.

843
01:12:36,924 --> 01:12:40,280
Have you figured out
what your new name is going to be yet?

844
01:12:40,884 --> 01:12:42,476
It's going to be Ruth.

845
01:12:43,884 --> 01:12:46,682
Like the Ruth in the Bible,
that followed Naomi.

846
01:12:47,164 --> 01:12:49,598
-That's a boring name.
-Not at all.

847
01:12:50,484 --> 01:12:52,315
Ruth is pure love.

848
01:12:53,564 --> 01:12:55,714
Will Mom have to call you Ruth?

849
01:12:56,484 --> 01:12:58,918
Once she gets comfortable with it.

850
01:13:01,364 --> 01:13:03,400
Where did she go tonight?

851
01:13:04,004 --> 01:13:06,120
To the movies, with a friend.

852
01:13:06,724 --> 01:13:08,521
Why was she so dressed up?

853
01:13:10,284 --> 01:13:13,674
I'm sure she just wanted
to make sure she looked nice.

854
01:13:15,324 --> 01:13:19,237
-What movie was she going to see?
-I don't know. I didn't ask.

855
01:13:19,724 --> 01:13:21,680
-Why not?
-I just didn't.

856
01:13:22,044 --> 01:13:23,762
Now leave it alone.

857
01:13:31,564 --> 01:13:36,274
I bought you a toothbrush
just in case you wanted to spend the night.

858
01:13:38,524 --> 01:13:39,513
Thanks.

859
01:13:41,164 --> 01:13:42,836
You should know...

860
01:13:43,644 --> 01:13:46,564
that in my last check-up,
I had my blood gone over...

861
01:13:47,564 --> 01:13:50,840
-and I'm clean as a whistle.
-Thanks for telling me.

862
01:13:52,724 --> 01:13:54,919
And I brought my own protection.

863
01:13:55,004 --> 01:13:56,801
Janeane can't have kids.

864
01:13:57,404 --> 01:14:02,194
But when we were trying,
I had my sperm count tested.

865
01:14:03,684 --> 01:14:05,163
It's pretty high.

866
01:14:06,884 --> 01:14:10,559
But if you brought something,
that's fine with me.

867
01:14:11,404 --> 01:14:13,599
I'm going through menopause, Frank.

868
01:14:15,684 --> 01:14:17,083
That's okay.

869
01:14:17,964 --> 01:14:20,478
One less thing to worry about.

870
01:14:35,604 --> 01:14:37,799
Would you like me to undress you?

871
01:14:40,684 --> 01:14:42,083
Not just yet.

872
01:14:43,764 --> 01:14:45,720
Would you like to undress me?

873
01:14:46,444 --> 01:14:49,595
I mean, it might help us
get into the mood a little more.

874
01:14:49,684 --> 01:14:51,163
Yeah, okay.

875
01:14:58,884 --> 01:15:00,715
Just got back to exercising.

876
01:15:04,204 --> 01:15:07,276
I'll be a lot more fit in a couple of months,
I'm sure.

877
01:15:07,484 --> 01:15:10,954
You look fine. I'm not much to look at.

878
01:15:12,004 --> 01:15:13,483
Yes, you are, Irma.

879
01:15:17,244 --> 01:15:19,075
You're a great-looking gal.

880
01:15:22,884 --> 01:15:27,082
You think maybe
that we could turn the lights out first?

881
01:15:29,124 --> 01:15:30,113
Sure.

882
01:16:26,044 --> 01:16:28,558
Were you able to sleep at all, Roy?

883
01:16:32,044 --> 01:16:34,080
I didn't really expect to.

884
01:16:54,244 --> 01:16:56,235
I want you to be happy, Irma.

885
01:17:03,524 --> 01:17:05,082
So do I, honey.

886
01:17:23,644 --> 01:17:25,999
This is a cute look. What do you think?

887
01:17:26,804 --> 01:17:28,601
-What, for you?
-No, for you.

888
01:17:29,244 --> 01:17:32,077
I can't wear pants like that.
They make my butt look big.

889
01:17:32,164 --> 01:17:35,201
-Stop, you got nothing there.
-Yes, I do.

890
01:17:35,604 --> 01:17:37,754
-Honey, can I help you?
-No.

891
01:17:39,004 --> 01:17:41,313
Mom, I'm getting my hair dyed black.

892
01:17:41,404 --> 01:17:42,837
-No, you're not.
-Why not?

893
01:17:42,924 --> 01:17:45,961
-You'll look like a drug addict.
-You could get a streak.

894
01:17:46,044 --> 01:17:48,080
She's not dyeing her hair anything.

895
01:17:48,164 --> 01:17:50,883
-You colour your hair.
-To cover the gray.

896
01:17:50,964 --> 01:17:53,273
Your hair is fine,
you don't need to do anything.

897
01:17:53,364 --> 01:17:55,594
Ruth says she wants to be a redhead.

898
01:17:55,924 --> 01:17:59,678
Patty Ann, you do not call us
by our first names ever.

899
01:18:00,124 --> 01:18:03,196
-Why not?
-Because it's disrespectful.

900
01:18:04,164 --> 01:18:07,759
-Dad, you don't mind, do you?
-Your mother's right, Patty.

901
01:18:08,604 --> 01:18:09,593
Fine.

902
01:18:10,564 --> 01:18:12,520
-Mom.
-What?

903
01:18:12,924 --> 01:18:15,597
Dad and I have the same breast size now.

904
01:18:19,164 --> 01:18:21,598
Patty Ann, would you excuse us
for a minute?

905
01:18:21,684 --> 01:18:24,323
Roy, do you think I could talk to you?

906
01:18:25,484 --> 01:18:28,237
-Am I in trouble?
-No, honey.

907
01:18:39,684 --> 01:18:41,276
Were you showing her your breasts?

908
01:18:41,364 --> 01:18:44,276
She saw them
while I was shaving under my arms.

909
01:18:44,364 --> 01:18:48,323
They're just breasts, Irma.
She's seen yours, she's seen her own.

910
01:18:48,404 --> 01:18:50,679
I won't cover up
something perfectly natural.

911
01:18:50,764 --> 01:18:54,074
''Natural'' is not a word
I would use in your case.

912
01:18:54,164 --> 01:18:57,520
-What kind of dig is that?
-It wasn't a dig.

913
01:18:57,604 --> 01:18:58,832
It was a fact.

914
01:18:58,924 --> 01:19:02,155
Excuse me, I'm not the only one
taking hormones in this house.

915
01:19:02,244 --> 01:19:06,396
You bastard!
You have no idea what I'm going through!

916
01:19:06,484 --> 01:19:07,633
If I've been insensitive--

917
01:19:07,724 --> 01:19:11,273
Insensitive doesn't even
begin to describe it, it's grotesque!

918
01:19:11,364 --> 01:19:14,436
-I'm sorry, what more can I say?
-I don't want an apology!

919
01:19:14,524 --> 01:19:18,278
-I want my husband back!
-You can't have him back!

920
01:19:22,124 --> 01:19:25,082
Why are you doing this to us?

921
01:19:26,084 --> 01:19:27,881
I'm still here, Irma.

922
01:19:31,004 --> 01:19:32,995
No, God.

923
01:19:33,084 --> 01:19:35,040
It's me.

924
01:19:44,404 --> 01:19:47,794
Look at me. It's me, I'm still here.

925
01:21:21,844 --> 01:21:23,402
Here we go.

926
01:21:29,004 --> 01:21:31,154
We sure do miss you at church, Irma.

927
01:21:31,244 --> 01:21:34,236
Well, I miss church, too.

928
01:21:35,124 --> 01:21:37,433
Everyone's been asking after you.

929
01:21:37,564 --> 01:21:41,762
The tremendous sympathy
people are feeling for you and Patty Ann.

930
01:21:42,844 --> 01:21:47,122
Everyone keeps coming up to me, saying,
''Can I bring them over a pie?

931
01:21:47,444 --> 01:21:50,117
''Is there anything around the house
that needs fixing?''

932
01:21:50,204 --> 01:21:53,116
Well, I am not a widow, Pastor.

933
01:21:54,284 --> 01:21:56,923
Of course not. It's just...

934
01:21:57,444 --> 01:21:59,435
that you're one of our most...

935
01:22:00,084 --> 01:22:01,358
cherished members.

936
01:22:01,444 --> 01:22:04,322
Everyone keeps talking about
all the great things...

937
01:22:04,404 --> 01:22:06,872
you've done for us over the years.

938
01:22:07,204 --> 01:22:10,196
Thank you,
but Roy has put in a lot more time.

939
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:14,881
You should be paying him a call
instead of me.

940
01:22:17,564 --> 01:22:20,397
Irma, I know in my effort
to turn over every stone...

941
01:22:20,484 --> 01:22:23,601
I had suggested
that you might have had a hand in this.

942
01:22:23,764 --> 01:22:26,756
-Yes, you did.
-I took a wrong turn.

943
01:22:27,444 --> 01:22:28,843
Forgive me.

944
01:22:29,044 --> 01:22:30,921
Let me assure you, you did not cause...

945
01:22:31,004 --> 01:22:34,121
or enable this problem of Roy's in any way.

946
01:22:34,484 --> 01:22:37,282
-This is not your fauIt.
-I know it isn't.

947
01:22:40,524 --> 01:22:43,357
Now I am going to tell you one more thing.

948
01:22:43,564 --> 01:22:44,997
As your pastor...

949
01:22:45,604 --> 01:22:47,162
and as your friend...

950
01:22:49,164 --> 01:22:52,713
I give you permission
to separate your life from his...

951
01:22:54,444 --> 01:22:56,480
without guiIt or regret.

952
01:22:57,924 --> 01:23:00,802
I give you permission to walk away.

953
01:23:04,284 --> 01:23:05,637
To walk away?

954
01:23:07,404 --> 01:23:08,393
Yes.

955
01:23:09,764 --> 01:23:11,675
But he's my heart.

956
01:23:16,804 --> 01:23:18,032
My heart.

957
01:23:33,204 --> 01:23:35,399
It's a beautiful morning in De Kalb County.

958
01:23:35,484 --> 01:23:37,440
Clear skies, highs in the mid 30s.

959
01:23:37,524 --> 01:23:40,914
Balmy enough to leave your parkas
in the closet during the day.

960
01:23:41,004 --> 01:23:42,562
But plan to bundle up tonight.

961
01:23:42,644 --> 01:23:45,875
We have a cold front coming in
that'll take us down to the teens.

962
01:23:45,964 --> 01:23:50,560
A storm is expected on Monday, but should
let up in time for the holiday weekend.

963
01:23:50,804 --> 01:23:52,920
And speaking of the holiday weekend...

964
01:23:53,004 --> 01:23:55,802
it's not too late to order your turkeys.

965
01:23:55,884 --> 01:23:58,921
They have been raising high-quality
corn-fed turkeys....

966
01:23:59,084 --> 01:24:01,996
Patty Ann! Honey, come on. I can't be late.

967
01:24:02,724 --> 01:24:04,362
-Bye.
-I love you.

968
01:24:23,964 --> 01:24:26,398
You've reached
the home of the Applewoods.

969
01:24:26,484 --> 01:24:30,716
We can't come to the phone right now,
so please leave a message. Bye.

970
01:24:34,764 --> 01:24:36,243
Hi, this is Wayne.

971
01:24:36,884 --> 01:24:40,399
Mom, I got your letter
about coming down for Thanksgiving.

972
01:24:42,124 --> 01:24:44,160
I am really...

973
01:24:46,124 --> 01:24:47,637
busy right now.

974
01:24:48,204 --> 01:24:51,355
But maybe I can come down
for a couple of days.

975
01:24:51,684 --> 01:24:53,197
Maybe one day.

976
01:24:54,084 --> 01:24:56,837
You know what? I'll be there for dinner.

977
01:24:59,244 --> 01:25:00,643
I'll have to see.

978
01:25:00,724 --> 01:25:03,113
Okay, I'll see you then.

979
01:25:03,804 --> 01:25:05,522
All right, bye-bye.

980
01:25:09,204 --> 01:25:10,193
Shit.

981
01:25:46,524 --> 01:25:48,276
I think it's done.

982
01:26:04,564 --> 01:26:05,997
Wayne's here!

983
01:26:14,884 --> 01:26:15,999
Hey, kiddo.

984
01:26:16,244 --> 01:26:18,439
You grew a beard. It's cool.

985
01:26:18,524 --> 01:26:20,242
-Hey, Mom.
-Hello, Wayne.

986
01:26:20,324 --> 01:26:22,394
Mom, look. Wayne has a beard!

987
01:26:22,484 --> 01:26:25,954
I see. Patty Ann, get off his back.

988
01:26:26,124 --> 01:26:28,797
We were worried about you.
Did you run into traffic?

989
01:26:28,884 --> 01:26:31,352
There was a storm on 7th,
so I took a different route.

990
01:26:31,444 --> 01:26:33,196
Honey, I am so glad to see you.

991
01:26:33,284 --> 01:26:35,559
-You feel skinny. Did you lose weight?
-No.

992
01:26:35,644 --> 01:26:37,396
Here, I brought you these.

993
01:26:38,524 --> 01:26:40,913
They are so beautiful. Thank you.

994
01:26:43,164 --> 01:26:45,439
Don't you want to bring your bags in?

995
01:26:45,844 --> 01:26:47,562
No, we can get them later.

996
01:26:48,164 --> 01:26:50,883
Well, if you have any laundry
that you want me to do...

997
01:26:50,964 --> 01:26:52,875
you just bring it in, okay?

998
01:26:52,964 --> 01:26:55,876
Come on in, you must be so hungry.

999
01:26:59,724 --> 01:27:01,123
This is so beautiful.

1000
01:27:01,284 --> 01:27:03,320
Wayne, I can make a muscle.

1001
01:27:03,484 --> 01:27:04,883
Yeah. I see.

1002
01:27:05,204 --> 01:27:07,513
You know what, honey? I like your beard.

1003
01:27:07,604 --> 01:27:09,003
-Yeah?
-Yes, I do.

1004
01:27:09,084 --> 01:27:11,120
-I got tired of shaving.
-Of course.

1005
01:27:11,204 --> 01:27:12,603
The turkey is all set...

1006
01:27:12,684 --> 01:27:15,756
so you showed up just in the nick of time.

1007
01:27:15,844 --> 01:27:17,835
-Want something to drink?
-Do you have beer?

1008
01:27:17,924 --> 01:27:19,152
-I got it.
-Okay.

1009
01:27:19,244 --> 01:27:21,235
Wayne, I got my ear pierced again.

1010
01:27:21,324 --> 01:27:23,724
Yeah. You look like a pin cushion.
Who's ahead?

1011
01:27:23,964 --> 01:27:25,363
-Chicago.
-All right.

1012
01:27:25,444 --> 01:27:26,718
How is work, honey?

1013
01:27:26,804 --> 01:27:28,954
The band is on a break right now.

1014
01:27:29,084 --> 01:27:32,315
They'll start again in January.
They want me to work their sound.

1015
01:27:32,404 --> 01:27:34,599
Really? That's a big step, isn't it?

1016
01:27:34,724 --> 01:27:36,874
-What kind of glass do you want?
-The can's fine.

1017
01:27:36,964 --> 01:27:39,558
Does that mean that they will pay you more?

1018
01:27:39,644 --> 01:27:41,475
I should be making pretty good money.

1019
01:27:41,564 --> 01:27:44,203
This is turning into a real career, isn't it?

1020
01:27:44,604 --> 01:27:47,641
-Do you do a lot of stuff backstage?
-What do you mean?

1021
01:27:47,724 --> 01:27:48,793
-You know--
-No.

1022
01:27:48,884 --> 01:27:53,082
So, honey, does that mean
that you are going to have to travel a lot?

1023
01:27:53,164 --> 01:27:55,234
Yeah. We might go to Europe next year.

1024
01:27:55,324 --> 01:27:58,634
-Europe? Isn't that wonderful?
-Can I go with you in the summer?

1025
01:27:58,724 --> 01:28:00,680
-I'll work in the crew.
-No.

1026
01:28:02,084 --> 01:28:05,281
Wayne, did you know
I'm working at your old high school now?

1027
01:28:05,364 --> 01:28:06,513
Yeah? Great.

1028
01:28:06,604 --> 01:28:09,641
The secretary retired,
so I've taken on her job.

1029
01:28:10,164 --> 01:28:13,679
-Who cuts your hair?
-Will you stop interrupting?

1030
01:28:13,804 --> 01:28:16,602
-I wasn't. I thought you were done.
-I wasn't.

1031
01:28:16,684 --> 01:28:19,596
-Can you finish the relish tray, please?
-Where's Dad?

1032
01:28:19,684 --> 01:28:22,437
Well, he's still getting dressed.

1033
01:28:23,844 --> 01:28:27,041
You know, Wayne,
I'd love, if you have a moment...

1034
01:28:27,324 --> 01:28:29,884
if you could look at the basement,
because...

1035
01:28:30,244 --> 01:28:31,757
we seem to have a leak.

1036
01:28:31,844 --> 01:28:34,642
-Sure. You want me to do it now?
-No.

1037
01:28:34,804 --> 01:28:38,001
I want you to sit and just relax
for a little while, okay?

1038
01:28:38,084 --> 01:28:41,315
-I don't mind.
-Do it after supper, there's a lot of time.

1039
01:28:41,524 --> 01:28:42,798
Hey, Pop.

1040
01:28:46,604 --> 01:28:48,515
-How was your trip?
-It was good.

1041
01:28:48,604 --> 01:28:52,074
Is the van running all right?
I heard a knock in the engine...

1042
01:28:52,164 --> 01:28:55,122
when you pulled up to the house.
Want me to take a look at it?

1043
01:28:55,204 --> 01:28:56,353
Yeah, great.

1044
01:28:57,644 --> 01:28:59,202
So, you grew a beard?

1045
01:28:59,644 --> 01:29:02,397
-Got tired of shaving.
-So did l.

1046
01:29:07,284 --> 01:29:09,161
-You want to sit down?
-Yeah.

1047
01:29:09,924 --> 01:29:11,676
-What are you having?
-A beer.

1048
01:29:11,764 --> 01:29:14,403
I think I'll join you. Irma, can I have a beer?

1049
01:29:14,484 --> 01:29:15,553
All right.

1050
01:29:19,804 --> 01:29:22,193
-How's work?
-Work is going good.

1051
01:29:23,124 --> 01:29:24,193
Good.

1052
01:29:26,844 --> 01:29:28,197
Thank you.

1053
01:29:29,044 --> 01:29:30,238
Who's ahead?

1054
01:29:31,044 --> 01:29:32,762
-Chicago.
-All right.

1055
01:29:33,644 --> 01:29:36,204
Could you turn the sound up on the TV?

1056
01:29:36,284 --> 01:29:37,763
We're ready to eat now.

1057
01:29:37,844 --> 01:29:40,233
-We just want to hear the game.
-Well....

1058
01:29:40,844 --> 01:29:43,483
Patty Ann, would you get the olives, please?

1059
01:29:44,524 --> 01:29:49,234
You know, Wayne, I think that I am going
to have you carve the turkey this year.

1060
01:29:49,404 --> 01:29:52,123
-I've never done it before, Mom.
-I'll do it, Irma.

1061
01:29:52,204 --> 01:29:54,798
No, I want Wayne to do it.

1062
01:29:55,004 --> 01:29:58,679
It's easy, sweetheart.
We have an electric knife.

1063
01:29:59,244 --> 01:30:01,553
-Wayne, can you open this?
-Yeah, sure.

1064
01:30:02,044 --> 01:30:03,523
-Give it to me.
-I got it.

1065
01:30:03,604 --> 01:30:04,559
Come on.

1066
01:30:04,644 --> 01:30:07,363
-Just run it under hot water.
-I got it.

1067
01:30:12,044 --> 01:30:13,523
Here you go.

1068
01:30:13,844 --> 01:30:16,677
-Dad, look at your hand, gross.
-What happened?

1069
01:30:16,764 --> 01:30:19,153
A little bit of skin, that's all, scraped skin.

1070
01:30:19,244 --> 01:30:20,836
Honey, you hurt yourself.

1071
01:30:20,924 --> 01:30:23,757
No, it's all right. It's okay. Quit it, all right?

1072
01:30:23,844 --> 01:30:26,358
Don't worry.
Dad's hormones are making him soft.

1073
01:30:26,444 --> 01:30:28,594
Mom, do you want me to do anything?

1074
01:30:29,364 --> 01:30:30,763
No, we're all set.

1075
01:30:31,724 --> 01:30:36,081
If you want, you can open that bottle
of wine that's on the dining room table.

1076
01:30:36,164 --> 01:30:37,563
And, Patty Ann...

1077
01:30:37,644 --> 01:30:41,683
honey, we are ready
to take out the side dishes.

1078
01:30:44,564 --> 01:30:47,681
And don't forget to use the trivets.

1079
01:30:48,924 --> 01:30:51,563
-Want some help?
-No, I have it.

1080
01:30:55,284 --> 01:30:57,878
-Wayne looks good.
-Yes, he does.

1081
01:30:57,964 --> 01:30:59,283
I like the beard.

1082
01:31:02,884 --> 01:31:06,001
-Are you mad at me?
-We don't have to talk about it now.

1083
01:31:06,084 --> 01:31:07,642
-Yes, we do.
-No.

1084
01:31:07,884 --> 01:31:09,203
What did I do?

1085
01:31:10,124 --> 01:31:13,082
-Roy, you know what you did.
-No, I don't. Tell me.

1086
01:31:13,444 --> 01:31:15,400
''Irma, can you get me a beer?''

1087
01:31:15,484 --> 01:31:17,839
''Turn up the TV.''
What kind of macho crap was that?

1088
01:31:17,924 --> 01:31:22,122
-I can't relax with my son and have a beer?
-Come on, Roy. You were putting it on.

1089
01:31:22,204 --> 01:31:25,355
-You don't have to show off for him.
-I was not.

1090
01:31:25,444 --> 01:31:28,754
What was that crap about carving
the turkey? It was uncalled for--

1091
01:31:28,844 --> 01:31:31,756
-I just wanted to give him something to do.
-No, you weren't.

1092
01:31:31,844 --> 01:31:33,994
-You were making him the head of the table.
-No.

1093
01:31:34,084 --> 01:31:37,281
-I can't help you in my own kitchen.
-Why don't you toss the salad?

1094
01:31:37,364 --> 01:31:40,117
-You're making me an outcast.
-Mom, the cork broke.

1095
01:31:43,764 --> 01:31:45,561
-Shoot.
-Sorry.

1096
01:31:45,844 --> 01:31:48,802
That's no problem. We can fix that.

1097
01:31:49,284 --> 01:31:50,683
-We need an awl.
-An awl?

1098
01:31:50,764 --> 01:31:53,278
Got one in my workbench.
We're in the basement.

1099
01:31:53,364 --> 01:31:54,922
Right. Okay.

1100
01:32:04,284 --> 01:32:07,959
You need some power tools?
I'm giving my extra ones away.

1101
01:32:08,404 --> 01:32:11,794
-No, I'm good.
-Look around. Take anything you need.

1102
01:32:17,244 --> 01:32:21,396
You know, I think I'll go up and see
if there's anything else Mom needs.

1103
01:32:21,484 --> 01:32:23,998
Wayne, I know...

1104
01:32:24,324 --> 01:32:25,837
this is hard for you.

1105
01:32:25,924 --> 01:32:29,121
But I really appreciate you coming.
It means a lot to me.

1106
01:32:29,204 --> 01:32:31,923
-Sure, well--
-So is there anything you want...

1107
01:32:32,004 --> 01:32:34,564
to talk to me about?
Anything you want to ask?

1108
01:32:34,644 --> 01:32:36,316
No. Not right now.

1109
01:32:38,564 --> 01:32:41,476
We never have had much to say
to each other, have we?

1110
01:32:41,964 --> 01:32:43,761
No, I guess we never really have.

1111
01:32:43,844 --> 01:32:46,278
No. I couldn't talk to my father, either.

1112
01:32:47,284 --> 01:32:49,957
I don't know anyone who really gets along
with their dad.

1113
01:32:50,044 --> 01:32:52,638
You know, it shouldn't have to be that way.

1114
01:32:53,764 --> 01:32:55,117
No, it shouldn't.

1115
01:32:55,484 --> 01:32:57,918
-We're ready to eat.
-Yeah, we're just coming.

1116
01:32:58,004 --> 01:32:59,517
I'm fixing the cork.

1117
01:33:01,684 --> 01:33:03,402
She still calls you Roy?

1118
01:33:03,484 --> 01:33:05,440
Yeah, until the surgery.

1119
01:33:08,364 --> 01:33:09,922
Did Mom decide....

1120
01:33:11,004 --> 01:33:13,359
Are you and she
going to keep living together?

1121
01:33:13,444 --> 01:33:14,433
Yeah.

1122
01:33:14,964 --> 01:33:17,034
So does that mean that....

1123
01:33:18,404 --> 01:33:20,440
Do you still sleep in the same bed?

1124
01:33:24,364 --> 01:33:27,481
Sexually, you're still into women,
you're into Mom?

1125
01:33:27,564 --> 01:33:28,519
Correct.

1126
01:33:28,604 --> 01:33:31,357
So as a man you're straight,
but as a woman you're gay?

1127
01:33:31,444 --> 01:33:35,073
Your mother happens to be the person
I fell in love with.

1128
01:33:35,164 --> 01:33:38,042
-Doesn't that make Mom a lesbian?
-Not necessarily.

1129
01:33:38,124 --> 01:33:39,603
Come on, Pop.

1130
01:33:39,684 --> 01:33:42,039
Honey, your mother's sexuality
hasn't changed.

1131
01:33:42,124 --> 01:33:44,433
We're staying together
because we love each other.

1132
01:33:44,524 --> 01:33:45,843
In other words...

1133
01:33:46,084 --> 01:33:48,996
if the two of you ever split up,
she'd go back to men.

1134
01:33:49,084 --> 01:33:50,233
Probably.

1135
01:33:50,324 --> 01:33:52,042
-So she's straight.
-Yes, Wayne.

1136
01:33:52,124 --> 01:33:54,638
But she'll sleep with you
when you become a woman.

1137
01:33:54,724 --> 01:33:57,443
-Maybe. Maybe not.
-No, if she did....

1138
01:33:58,124 --> 01:34:00,354
Women with women. I can understand that.

1139
01:34:00,444 --> 01:34:02,674
If I was a chick,
I wouldn't want to be with a guy.

1140
01:34:02,764 --> 01:34:05,324
I'd much rather be with chicks. I love chicks.

1141
01:34:06,124 --> 01:34:08,513
-Maybe I'm a lesbian, too.
-That's enough, Wayne.

1142
01:34:08,604 --> 01:34:10,720
-What?
-You're being sarcastic.

1143
01:34:10,804 --> 01:34:13,113
I'm just trying to figure all this out.

1144
01:34:13,204 --> 01:34:14,557
I'm glad you are.

1145
01:34:14,844 --> 01:34:16,721
Calling me sarcastic?

1146
01:34:16,884 --> 01:34:19,000
I'm too fucking confused to be sarcastic.

1147
01:34:19,084 --> 01:34:20,642
Let's not fight.

1148
01:34:21,004 --> 01:34:22,915
You know what? Let's just not talk.

1149
01:34:42,884 --> 01:34:44,237
I'm sorry.

1150
01:35:04,284 --> 01:35:07,003
Honey, I think you've carved enough turkey.

1151
01:35:07,084 --> 01:35:09,314
It's time to start thinking about
finding those...

1152
01:35:09,404 --> 01:35:11,360
special gifts for family and friends.

1153
01:35:20,804 --> 01:35:23,796
Well, I think we could make...

1154
01:35:23,924 --> 01:35:26,119
a nice soup out of this tomorrow.

1155
01:35:27,164 --> 01:35:28,597
Yeah, good idea.

1156
01:35:29,724 --> 01:35:31,954
Ma, what do you want me to do
with my laundry?

1157
01:35:32,044 --> 01:35:33,841
Just leave it on the landing.

1158
01:35:35,244 --> 01:35:38,441
Honey, can you come in here a minute?

1159
01:35:38,884 --> 01:35:39,873
Please?

1160
01:35:40,884 --> 01:35:45,321
I just wanted you
to go through your Dad's clothes...

1161
01:35:45,604 --> 01:35:47,560
before I gave them all away.

1162
01:35:48,684 --> 01:35:51,118
-You need a tie?
-I don't wear ties.

1163
01:35:51,204 --> 01:35:54,833
Yeah, but you never know.
You might need one for a wedding...

1164
01:35:54,924 --> 01:35:58,553
or if you go to a nice restaurant.
Look, this one feels like you.

1165
01:35:58,644 --> 01:36:00,564
I think I gave him this one for his birthday,
or Father's Day...

1166
01:36:00,564 --> 01:36:02,794
I think I gave him this one for his birthday,
or Father's Day...

1167
01:36:03,124 --> 01:36:05,001
or one of those Dad events.

1168
01:36:05,084 --> 01:36:08,520
-Can you use an electric razor?
-No.

1169
01:36:09,444 --> 01:36:13,403
-Here's a brand-new package of undershirts.
-No, thanks.

1170
01:36:15,604 --> 01:36:16,593
Look...

1171
01:36:16,844 --> 01:36:19,677
this is a lovely jacket.

1172
01:36:19,924 --> 01:36:22,518
It's way too nice.
I don't wear that kind of thing.

1173
01:36:22,604 --> 01:36:26,153
It's very sporty, too.
You could wear it with a pair of jeans.

1174
01:36:26,244 --> 01:36:29,156
Here, come on. Just try it. Slip it on once.

1175
01:36:29,364 --> 01:36:30,638
It should fit.

1176
01:36:32,204 --> 01:36:36,197
Well, no, it's too big in the shoulder.

1177
01:36:36,284 --> 01:36:39,401
But you could always have it aItered.
Lift that there...

1178
01:36:40,044 --> 01:36:42,558
and lengthen the sleeves a little bit.

1179
01:36:44,244 --> 01:36:45,563
What are you doing?

1180
01:36:45,644 --> 01:36:48,716
It still has some of his aftershave
on the collar.

1181
01:36:48,804 --> 01:36:50,760
-But it'll come out--
-I don't want it.

1182
01:36:50,844 --> 01:36:53,756
I don't want any of his stuff. Jesus Christ!

1183
01:36:54,884 --> 01:36:57,717
Look, Wayne, I'm sorry.
I know this is hard on you.

1184
01:36:57,804 --> 01:37:00,159
Forget about me. What about you?

1185
01:37:00,884 --> 01:37:03,352
Aren't you revolted? Aren't you pissed?

1186
01:37:06,204 --> 01:37:09,037
-No, not anymore.
-Come on, Ma, there must....

1187
01:37:11,564 --> 01:37:14,032
Jesus! Do you actually like him
as a woman?

1188
01:37:15,004 --> 01:37:17,074
I like having him alive.

1189
01:37:18,484 --> 01:37:22,193
-And I like having him with me.
-What do you get out of him?

1190
01:37:22,484 --> 01:37:24,520
I get his love, Wayne.

1191
01:37:27,204 --> 01:37:30,116
-Is Wayne taking any of Daddy's stuff?
-No.

1192
01:37:31,244 --> 01:37:33,121
-Can I have this jacket?
-No, honey.

1193
01:37:33,204 --> 01:37:34,876
-Put it down.
-Why?

1194
01:37:34,964 --> 01:37:36,761
Just leave it alone!

1195
01:37:37,084 --> 01:37:40,235
Wayne, did you find anything
you could use?

1196
01:37:41,524 --> 01:37:45,278
My taste is probably a little square for you.

1197
01:37:45,804 --> 01:37:48,682
But this is a sharp jacket.

1198
01:37:48,764 --> 01:37:51,562
-Did you try it on?
-Yeah. It doesn't really fit.

1199
01:37:51,644 --> 01:37:53,475
Just give it to me, Roy.

1200
01:37:53,564 --> 01:37:56,158
-I'll take it to the church.
-I can use the jacket.

1201
01:37:56,244 --> 01:37:59,600
No, honey.
Wayne, I'm going to give you my watch.

1202
01:37:59,684 --> 01:38:03,916
I had the jeweller clean it.
Put in a new battery. It should work perfect.

1203
01:38:04,004 --> 01:38:07,360
-Explain to me why I can't have the jacket!
-Cool it!

1204
01:38:07,604 --> 01:38:09,515
-What's this about?
-What do you mean?

1205
01:38:09,604 --> 01:38:11,754
What am I supposed to do with your watch?

1206
01:38:11,844 --> 01:38:15,041
Wear it with pride,
and pass it on to the next generation?

1207
01:38:15,124 --> 01:38:17,194
''Here, son, this is your granddad's.

1208
01:38:17,284 --> 01:38:19,752
''He gave it to me
when he switched to a Lady Timex.''

1209
01:38:19,844 --> 01:38:23,996
Fuck your watch, your watch is bogus.
I don't want it near my fucking wrist.

1210
01:38:24,084 --> 01:38:28,362
-Don't use that language with your father.
-Are you actually trying to defend him?

1211
01:38:28,444 --> 01:38:31,402
This freak who kept you going for what,
25, 26 years?

1212
01:38:31,484 --> 01:38:34,556
Shared your bed. Got you pregnant.
Don't you feel scammed?

1213
01:38:34,644 --> 01:38:36,953
-You're way out of line.
-No, you are.

1214
01:38:37,044 --> 01:38:40,480
We can't even have Thanksgiving
with Gran and Grandpa because of you.

1215
01:38:40,564 --> 01:38:42,873
-Get out now!
-You half-baked cunt.

1216
01:38:43,204 --> 01:38:45,434
You can't tell me what to do.

1217
01:38:46,164 --> 01:38:48,678
Don't you ever use that word again.

1218
01:38:50,604 --> 01:38:51,719
Cunt.

1219
01:38:52,564 --> 01:38:54,441
Stop it!

1220
01:39:00,204 --> 01:39:01,239
God!

1221
01:39:03,604 --> 01:39:05,276
Wayne, you all right?

1222
01:39:06,164 --> 01:39:08,280
-You okay?
-Get off me. Come on.

1223
01:39:08,364 --> 01:39:09,592
I'm okay, Ma.

1224
01:39:10,244 --> 01:39:11,882
I didn't mean that.

1225
01:39:13,324 --> 01:39:17,158
Irma, will you go get some ice?
Patty, go with your mom. Come on.

1226
01:39:17,404 --> 01:39:19,759
-Just let me see.
-I'm fine.

1227
01:39:20,564 --> 01:39:22,759
Wayne, please let me help you.

1228
01:39:24,644 --> 01:39:26,524
-Okay, can you feel anything?
-It's numb.

1229
01:39:26,524 --> 01:39:27,479
-Okay, can you feel anything?
-It's numb.

1230
01:39:30,004 --> 01:39:32,962
It's swelling, but I don't think it's....

1231
01:39:33,444 --> 01:39:35,719
I don't think it's broken. Here.

1232
01:39:36,204 --> 01:39:39,002
Come on. Sit down with me.

1233
01:39:39,764 --> 01:39:41,322
Come on, sit down.

1234
01:39:45,364 --> 01:39:47,753
I wouldn't hurt you for the world.

1235
01:39:59,644 --> 01:40:01,953
Wayne, my precious boy.

1236
01:40:34,244 --> 01:40:35,563
It's all right.

1237
01:41:28,244 --> 01:41:29,723
Hello, Mother.

1238
01:41:56,804 --> 01:41:58,317
Hello, Dad.

1239
01:42:02,284 --> 01:42:03,797
Who are you?

1240
01:42:04,284 --> 01:42:06,195
I'm your daughter Ruth.

1241
01:42:10,124 --> 01:42:13,753
I had some other daughters
visit me yesterday.

1242
01:42:13,964 --> 01:42:17,240
That woman over there,
she can tell you their names.

1243
01:42:17,844 --> 01:42:20,483
Margie and Beth drove up from Toledo.

1244
01:42:21,084 --> 01:42:23,518
Did you have a nice visit with them?

1245
01:42:24,044 --> 01:42:25,682
They brought a pie.

1246
01:42:26,524 --> 01:42:28,958
I didn't like it, it was too sweet.

1247
01:42:29,284 --> 01:42:32,037
It was a cake. He ate three pieces.

1248
01:42:32,564 --> 01:42:34,953
-What's your name? Ruth?
-Yes.

1249
01:42:37,364 --> 01:42:40,083
-So I have four daughters?
-Five.

1250
01:42:42,204 --> 01:42:44,479
I thought I had a son.

1251
01:42:45,804 --> 01:42:48,523
Ask that woman back there if I have a son.

1252
01:42:49,164 --> 01:42:50,677
No, you don't.

1253
01:42:51,804 --> 01:42:56,161
-Who am I going to leave the farm to, then?
-You're leaving it to Becky.

1254
01:42:57,284 --> 01:43:01,072
-Who's Becky? The nurse?
-She's your oldest daughter.

1255
01:43:01,164 --> 01:43:04,361
-I can't leave the farm to her.
-Well, you are.

1256
01:43:04,644 --> 01:43:07,920
-Where is she?
-She's out fixing the barn.

1257
01:43:10,564 --> 01:43:13,283
I better get out there,
or I'll get my butt whipped.

1258
01:43:13,364 --> 01:43:15,514
Who by? Becky?

1259
01:43:16,284 --> 01:43:18,320
No, my daddy.

1260
01:43:19,444 --> 01:43:21,594
We're putting in lima beans.

1261
01:43:22,284 --> 01:43:25,799
-I hate lima beans. Don't you?
-I can't stand them.

1262
01:43:25,884 --> 01:43:29,160
I told that woman over there
I'm not going to eat them.

1263
01:43:29,764 --> 01:43:32,324
That woman over there is your wife.

1264
01:43:32,964 --> 01:43:36,081
-She's been married to you for 50 years.
-I don't care.

1265
01:43:36,564 --> 01:43:39,954
You tell her I'm not going to eat
any more lima beans.

1266
01:43:40,044 --> 01:43:41,682
Her name is Em.

1267
01:43:41,764 --> 01:43:45,359
She's borne your children and cooked
your food and stood behind you...

1268
01:43:45,444 --> 01:43:50,120
in everything you did, no matter how
misguided or stupid or cruel.

1269
01:43:51,884 --> 01:43:54,876
She's old and she's tired.

1270
01:43:55,684 --> 01:43:58,323
And she still bathes you and feeds you...

1271
01:43:59,044 --> 01:44:01,353
and changes your soiled pants.

1272
01:44:02,124 --> 01:44:04,592
The least you can do
is call her by her name.

1273
01:44:06,564 --> 01:44:08,441
I don't want her.

1274
01:44:09,764 --> 01:44:11,834
I want my mama.

1275
01:44:13,164 --> 01:44:15,758
-She's not here.
-Why?

1276
01:44:17,124 --> 01:44:18,113
Daddy...

1277
01:44:19,884 --> 01:44:21,636
you're an old man.

1278
01:44:22,084 --> 01:44:24,279
Your mother's not alive anymore.

1279
01:44:24,564 --> 01:44:26,919
Roy, you ready for your sandwich?

1280
01:44:28,204 --> 01:44:30,240
I can't eat now.

1281
01:44:31,044 --> 01:44:32,841
I wet my pants.

1282
01:44:37,324 --> 01:44:39,360
I want my mama.

1283
01:44:40,644 --> 01:44:42,043
I'll change you.

1284
01:44:43,804 --> 01:44:45,999
-I want my mama.
-You want help, honey?

1285
01:44:46,084 --> 01:44:48,837
No, I can handle it.
You get some rest, Mother.

1286
01:44:49,004 --> 01:44:50,483
Get some rest.

1287
01:45:02,724 --> 01:45:04,396
This is the penis.

1288
01:45:04,924 --> 01:45:07,392
And this represents the skin
around the penis.

1289
01:45:07,924 --> 01:45:09,642
And these are the testicles.

1290
01:45:10,364 --> 01:45:13,959
First, you take out the testes...

1291
01:45:16,804 --> 01:45:18,442
leaving the scrotal sac.

1292
01:45:18,524 --> 01:45:21,516
Then you take out the inside of the penis...

1293
01:45:23,764 --> 01:45:27,723
and pull it inside out,
making what was once an outie an innie.

1294
01:45:28,044 --> 01:45:32,959
Then you take the scrotal sac,
and you cut it in half to make the labia.

1295
01:45:36,804 --> 01:45:38,396
Like this.

1296
01:45:42,804 --> 01:45:46,001
And voil! You have a vagina.

1297
01:45:48,364 --> 01:45:49,353
Thank you.

1298
01:45:50,164 --> 01:45:52,234
You've reached
the home of the Applewoods.

1299
01:45:52,324 --> 01:45:55,361
Neither Irma, Ruth, or Patty Ann
can come to the phone right now.

1300
01:45:55,444 --> 01:45:57,002
Please leave a message.

1301
01:45:57,964 --> 01:45:59,477
Hi, Mom, Dad.

1302
01:46:00,524 --> 01:46:03,641
I wanted to wish you guys
a happy anniversary.

1303
01:46:03,724 --> 01:46:06,079
Is it today? I think it's today.

1304
01:46:06,604 --> 01:46:08,481
Anyway, happy whatever.

1305
01:46:09,604 --> 01:46:13,916
I just wanted to call to wish Pop
good luck with his surgery tomorrow.

1306
01:46:14,684 --> 01:46:16,515
Let me know how it goes.

1307
01:46:17,364 --> 01:46:18,763
Hey, Patty Ann.

1308
01:46:21,564 --> 01:46:24,397
I love you guys. Take care.

1309
01:46:26,204 --> 01:46:27,842
This is Wayne.

1310
01:46:28,284 --> 01:46:29,273
Bye.

1311
01:46:38,644 --> 01:46:40,077
What do you think?

1312
01:46:46,204 --> 01:46:47,876
You're so pretty.

1313
01:46:50,004 --> 01:46:50,993
Here.

1314
01:46:52,124 --> 01:46:54,638
-Happy anniversary.
-Thank you.

1315
01:47:15,524 --> 01:47:17,355
They're so beautiful.

1316
01:47:29,804 --> 01:47:32,876
-What do you think?
-They look lovely.

1317
01:47:50,684 --> 01:47:53,357
I'd like to look at you one last time.

1318
01:48:38,404 --> 01:48:39,393
What?

1319
01:48:45,804 --> 01:48:46,998
Thank you.

1320
01:48:51,924 --> 01:48:53,562
Sweet Roy.

1321
01:48:55,044 --> 01:48:56,682
Sweet soul.

1322
01:48:59,044 --> 01:49:00,796
What we do for love.
