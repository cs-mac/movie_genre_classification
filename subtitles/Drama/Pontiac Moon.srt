<i>This drama is set during the Joseon Era

Episode 9

6
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,560
Who are you?

7
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,029
Who are you to dare to be here?

8
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,010
Tell me!
Who the hell are you?

9
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,830
Bring in the candles!

10
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:59,670
What are you doing? Bring in the candles
and light up this room immediately!

11
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:26,500
You...

12
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,250
Why are you here?

13
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,720
No way...

14
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,970
Nothing happened, right?

15
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,480
Hey, Jan Sil.

16
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,559
Don't you feel anything?

17
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,769
Darkness is approaching.

18
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,170
What darkness is approaching?

19
00:02:02,171 --> 00:02:04,960
What do you mean by that?

20
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,059
What darkness is approaching?

21
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,899
- What are you saying?
- Gosh.

22
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,820
You're blocking the light so it's dark.

23
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,590
Aish, seriously!

24
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,510
Whose orders are you following?

25
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,520
That night,
our meeting at Oh Nyang,

26
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,720
was it something you planned
because of someone's orders?

27
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,800
What did that person order you to do?

28
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,680
Did he tell you to seduce me?

29
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:52,240
If not, then did he tell you
to strangle me with these hands?

30
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:59,020
If that's also not it, did he tell you to
stab me with a knife so no one will know?

31
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,610
Tell me!

32
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,989
Whose orders are you taking as a spy?!

33
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:07,310
A spy you say?

34
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,679
I am not one.

35
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,850
I am just a human talisman.

36
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,720
Human talisman?

37
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,429
Your Majesty.
Please repress your anger.

38
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:32,259
This girl
is a Seongsucheong shaman

39
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,569
and brought here to protect your health.

40
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,589
She is not a spy.

41
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:38,879
Only a shaman. Not a spy?

42
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,289
That's right.

43
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:44,579
Just regard her as a talisman
and not human.

44
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,320
Then,

45
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,760
you're not even a human,

46
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:53,580
but you dare place a hand on my body?

47
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,880
Tell me!

48
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:01,389
The fact that these hands
will not strangle me,

49
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:04,160
who can guarantee that?!

50
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,009
Yo, Your... Your Majesty!

51
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:13,629
For placing my hands on your body,
I deserve a thousand deaths.

52
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:17,759
However, please give me a chance
to explain myself.

53
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,580
Explain?

54
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,240
Try then.

55
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:30,530
Generally, even though
the seasons are changing,

56
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:37,099
one must rest a bit in order for the ground
to be covered and flowers to bloom.

57
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,899
And so, a king who has to carry
the burden of the nation on his shoulders,

58
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,529
what more do I need to say?

59
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:48,409
You read the Classics,
so your excuses are great.

60
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:52,239
Your Majesty's body is the base
of this country's reign of peace.

61
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,479
With a weak body, how will you deal
with the citizens' problems?

62
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,900
So all I wanted to do was,

63
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,530
during the time
that Your Majesty was asleep,

64
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,820
to help you put down the
weariness of government affairs

65
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,980
and the pain in your heart,

66
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,799
and rest peacefully...

67
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,010
Did you just say the pain in my heart?

68
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,599
- What?
- You said you're a shaman,

69
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,879
so in your eyes, you're able to see
everything about a person, right?

70
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,369
Is that why you dare place
your hand on my body?

71
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,069
In order to read my heart?

72
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,829
I'm sorry,

73
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:35,550
but while you were asleep,
you called out a girl's name.

74
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:41,850
It carried the weight of all your pain.
And because I wanted to console you,

75
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:45,529
I dared to violate the law of
not touching the royal body.

76
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:49,149
<i>No.
This girl is not Yeon Woo.</i>

77
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:54,510
<i>If she was, she wouldn't pretend to know me
even after hearing her own name.</i>

78
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,769
<i>It's a misunderstanding.
It's an illusion.</i>

79
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,889
Your Majesty.

80
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:03,740
<i>I have to struggle free.</i>

81
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,740
Take that girl...

82
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,990
out of the palace immediately.

83
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,849
- Your Majesty.
- What are you doing?

84
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,619
Did you not hear my order?!

85
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,360
Your Majesty...

86
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,510
Your Majesty.

87
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,020
Your Majesty!

88
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,510
Your Majesty!

89
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,500
How dare you!

90
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,639
You dare place your hand on the royal body.
Are you out of your mind?

91
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,379
Once you were discovered,

92
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,929
you should have waited quietly
for your punishment.

93
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:01,520
Who do you think you are
to talk back to him?!

94
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,209
Lock this girl up
in the secret cell immediately.

95
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:06,230
- Yes.
- Yes!

96
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,310
- Miss!
- Stop this.

97
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,099
This girl
is a shaman of Seongsucheong,

98
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,079
so I'm going to punish her
according to shaman laws.

99
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,169
For a girl who touched the royal body, how
can she be tried according to shaman laws?

100
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,570
What are you doing?
Lock her up!

101
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,750
Sir!

102
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,809
On her forehead, I am going to inscribe
"criminal" and send her away,

103
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:36,659
so without my permission, you cannot
give her even a drop of water.

104
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,520
Yes.

105
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,720
Open the door!

106
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,390
Mistress.
Mistress!

107
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,070
Open the door!

108
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:25,480
Open the door
Please, open the door!

109
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,950
Seol!

110
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,450
Your Majesty...
Your Majesty.

111
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,230
Your Majesty!

112
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,059
<i>That's right.</i>

113
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:20,960
<i>Just regard her as a talisman
and not human.</i>

114
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,500
Then you're not even a human,

115
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:28,480
but you dare put a hand on my body?

116
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:53,960
<i>It seems like the professor
has caught the shaman, so let's go.</i>

117
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,180
This matter cannot be known by others.

118
00:10:08,181 --> 00:10:09,959
Do you understand?

119
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,490
Yes.
Let's go.

120
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:26,470
Wow!
It's been a long time.

121
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:29,910
Professor of Prophecy.

122
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,360
Don't be so nervous.

123
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,580
You don't think I'll eat you, right?

124
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:53,259
It is dangerous for the royal
to imitate the ministers,

125
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,869
don't you know that?

126
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,829
Of course, I know.
Why wouldn't I know that?

127
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,469
Was there ever a time when the
Office of Gwansanggam, Seongsucheong,

128
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,689
and Sogyeokseo tried to get credit
for someone else's work?

129
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,450
Ah!

130
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,550
That is what you're talking about, right?

131
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:14,119
I'm sorry but if you are aware of that,

132
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,510
what is the reason you have come here?

133
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:22,250
First of all,
take a look at this.

134
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,249
How is it?
It looks really painful, right?

135
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:29,490
Oh...
It does look painful but...

136
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,869
Aren't you going to ask how this happened?

137
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,829
How...

138
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,399
did you become like that?

139
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:42,559
Not too long ago, I was helping a shaman
who was being chased and got this wound.

140
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,119
In front of her,
I pretended to be cool,

141
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,270
but a few awful men came along
and messed everything up.

142
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:54,339
According to those unidentified assailants,
the Professor

143
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,010
had taken the shaman.

144
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,250
So,

145
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:02,310
I used my broken head a bit.

146
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,500
Professor, you say?

147
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:11,470
It can't be the professor of
medicine and nursing, doctor, or translator.

148
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,230
Then,

149
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,630
the Princess's etiquette professor,
is it?

150
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,530
I thought so but it's not.

151
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,983
The professor of fermentation from Hyung Joo

152
00:12:22,018 --> 00:12:26,141
doesn't personally go out
and work on their own...

153
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:31,219
Then,
there is just one left.

154
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:35,550
The Office of Gwansanggam.

155
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,730
Among them,

156
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:45,320
it's the professor of prophecy.

157
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:52,259
That shaman,
where is she now?

158
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:56,769
How would I know about
the whereabouts of the shaman?

159
00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:01,079
I received an order to tackle
the heresy and send out guards,

160
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,599
and brought in all the shamans and monks
inside the capital for investigation.

161
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,859
At that time, I was disguised as a monk.

162
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,729
Then,
why didn't you arrest me?

163
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,680
That is...

164
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,419
that girl committed a crime of
adultery and foulness,

165
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,359
so we were keen on arresting her.

166
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,869
After arresting her,
where did you imprison her?

167
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,609
Is it Yongsankang?

168
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:24,469
No, it's not.

169
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:29,369
She was filled with such evil that
we sent her far away to the south.

170
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:31,049
Then tell me her registered name!

171
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:34,359
She did not even register her name
and committed a promiscuous offense,

172
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,460
that is why we were arresting her.

173
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,240
Prince Yang Myung.

174
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:10,680
It seems like both of you are quite in a
hurry to get to the King's quarters.

175
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,109
By any chance, did something happen
to His Majesty The King?

176
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:17,560
Why do you ask that?

177
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,060
Are you hoping that
something does happen to the King?

178
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,029
- Queen Dowager...
- The Royal Concubine

179
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,660
is no longer in the palace.

180
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:30,219
The warning about entering the palace
from the previous King,

181
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,739
have you forgotten it already?

182
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,350
Why are you acting this way,
Queen Dowager?

183
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:37,750
He came because he was worried
about His Majesty.

184
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:40,020
Isn't that right?

185
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:45,820
Recently, I heard that
villainous people are gathering.

186
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,920
That...

187
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,970
has nothing to do with me.

188
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,320
Haven't you heard that
when there's smoke there's fire?

189
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,000
They're gathering because
they smell a foul odor from someone.

190
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:06,220
But, you need to keep something in mind.

191
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:11,700
As long as I am alive,
you will never be king.

192
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,869
Do you understand?

193
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,390
It will never happen.

194
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,960
Let's go, Queen.

195
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,910
Grandmother...

196
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:34,780
Your vigor isn't what it used to be,

197
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,950
so it makes me quite upset.

198
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,670
Just now,

199
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,489
what did you say?

200
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:47,010
The flies gathering in front of my house
are not because of a foul smell,

201
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,860
but isn't it because the King
doesn't have an heir to his throne?

202
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,569
For the King to be safe,

203
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:58,290
you will have to live until
you're 100 years old.

204
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,580
I am very worried,

205
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:05,820
because it seems like
I will live longer than you will.

206
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:10,290
While you're alive,
you must be filled with worries.

207
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:18,260
For your health and prosperity,

208
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:21,439
I will come visit you often
and act cute for you.

209
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,260
Then,

210
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,970
please remain healthy.

211
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:40,299
Are you feeling well?

212
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,939
As you can see, I am fine.
I am well.

213
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,899
That is a relief.

214
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,559
In the middle of the night,
your attendants were frantic,

215
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,479
so I thought your health had worsened again.

216
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,000
Nothing has happened.
Do not worry.

217
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,800
You must become stronger.

218
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,499
So that

219
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,909
the villainous supporters of
Prince Yang Myung becoming king

220
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:06,959
will not be able to rise and incite trouble.

221
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,789
Why are you acting like this, Queen Dowager?

222
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,939
They're just acting on their own,

223
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,789
so how could Prince Yang Myung have known?

224
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,569
Prince Yang Myung...

225
00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:20,740
his presence alone
is plenty a threat to you.

226
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:25,490
You have to become stronger, Your Majesty.

227
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,299
You must produce an heir soon.

228
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:33,909
More importantly, you must distance
yourself from Prince Yang Myung.

229
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:38,970
That is the only way that you can
remain on the King's throne.

230
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,900
Do you understand?

231
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,080
Prince Yang Myung.

232
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,720
Mother.

233
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:30,559
What were you so sincerely praying for?

234
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,770
I always pray
for the safety of His Majesty The King.

235
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:39,300
I ask that Buddha brings you
a beautiful wife,

236
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,710
I pray for that, as well.

237
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:45,530
What is it?

238
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,890
Even without any adornment,

239
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:52,090
your hair is still as beautiful.

240
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,870
Even though I converted to Buddhism,

241
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,500
I am unable to forget about the past,

242
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,620
and I haven't been able
to shave my head, yet.

243
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:06,819
One day, when I can forget
about the past, I will...

244
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,760
Just...

245
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:11,940
keep your hair.

246
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,690
Who knows?

247
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:18,790
If His Majesty The King were to have
an unfortunate accident,

248
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,009
Mother will become Queen.

249
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,509
Prince Yang Myung.

250
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:26,889
How can you say such treacherous words?

251
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:31,239
Don't you know that His Majesty's safety
is also your safety?

252
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,700
How could I not know?

253
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,520
From the day I was born until today,

254
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:42,830
isn't that what you've been telling me?

255
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,020
Prince Yang Myung.

256
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:52,619
A tree tries to remain standing
but the wind never cease.

257
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,920
In the end,
the tree will bend and shake.

258
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,879
Please, don't bend
no matter what wind may come.

259
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,639
Don't waver.

260
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,060
That is the only way
for the King to be comfortable

261
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,520
and Prince Yang Myung will be safe.

262
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:12,610
Prince Yang Myung...

263
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,360
Mother,

264
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,950
do you believe in reincarnation?

265
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:24,020
I have emptied my heart.

266
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,770
I have no desire for power
or to reside in the palace.

267
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,440
I have no greed for any of those things.

268
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,080
I just...

269
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,760
want one person.

270
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:44,480
If another life does exist,

271
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:48,700
I wish to meet this person again.

272
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:55,480
I'm afraid that
she will not recognize me.

273
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,720
That again,
she will not choose me

274
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:04,340
but someone else.

275
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:09,650
We may have met already,

276
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:16,260
but I might lose her again.

277
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:23,020
That is my only concern.

278
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:50,410
<i>Where do I have to go
to find you?</i>

279
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,710
Woon...

280
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,809
Do you also believe
that Yang Myung hyung

281
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:10,500
is someone who would do that?

282
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,369
You know Brother very well,
so tell me.

283
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:22,579
Are you questioning his motives?

284
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:25,640
Is there any reason
why I should doubt him?

285
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,910
Since there are people
continually shaking him,

286
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:32,900
before he bends, I'm afraid that
he will break. I'm worried.

287
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,150
Isn't it funny?

288
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:39,740
The King's throne...

289
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:43,970
Even my brother who I share
the same blood with,

290
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,870
I must view him as an enemy.

291
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:53,030
Especially today,
this position is overwhelming.

292
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,389
<i>During the time that
Your Majesty was asleep,</i>

293
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:00,499
<i>to help you put down the
weariness of government affairs</i>

294
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:03,369
and the pain in your heart,

295
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:05,939
and rest peacefully...

296
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:08,529
- Woon
- Please give your order.

297
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:12,920
Seongsucheong's records,
check them.

298
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,649
What is it that you want to confirm?

299
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,880
Also check on the movements
on Minister Yoon's side.

300
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,529
Do you want me to confirm
that she's a spy?

301
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:23,990
Or is it that you want confirmation
that she isn't a spy?

302
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:44,910
<i>Yeon Woo...
Yeon Woo.</i>

303
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,879
Yeon Woo!

304
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,980
You mustn't, Yeon Woo!
Yeon Woo.

305
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,850
Yeon Woo...

306
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,480
Aigoo, my baby.

307
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,500
My precious baby!

308
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,520
You're alive?

309
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:36,440
You're alive.

310
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:42,019
It is cold, but why are you wearing
such thin clothes?

311
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,770
What are you going to do
if you catch a cold?

312
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:50,760
Didn't it hurt?

313
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,800
Wasn't it difficult?

314
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,230
Weren't you cold?

315
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:01,240
Weren't you scared?

316
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,920
Please say something.

317
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:16,820
Mother.

318
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,820
Yes.

319
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:24,990
Please...
take care of yourself.

320
00:25:37,622 --> 00:25:39,818
Mother...

321
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:53,240
Mother...

322
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:01,819
Are you going to leave Miss like that?
You're the High Shaman, aren't you?

323
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,959
They said
they're going to brand her face!

324
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,839
I'm going to charge in and break the...

325
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,429
Be quiet.
I'm gathering my thoughts.

326
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,329
Can you solve anything
just by thinking?

327
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:14,819
My Miss,
thanks to someone,

328
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:18,520
cannot breathe well in a small,
confined dark space.

329
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:22,009
It would be better to go to the King
and tell him the truth.

330
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:26,190
The Shaman Wol that His Majesty is
trying to kill is actually Heo Yeon Woo.

331
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,960
Shut that mouth of yours!

332
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:31,069
Just one more time,

333
00:26:31,070 --> 00:26:33,519
if you dare to say such nonsense again,

334
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,470
I will tear open your mouth.

335
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:43,230
I'm trying to find a solution, so stop
disturbing my concentration and get out now!

336
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:00,480
<i>Brother,
it's Yeon Woo.</i>

337
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,140
I see it's time for us
to read already.

338
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:16,550
Let's see. What book did we say
we were going to read today?

339
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:22,780
<i>Your face has worry written all over it.</i>

340
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:42,040
Mother.

341
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:50,730
You were fine for a while,
so why are you acting like this again?

342
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,540
Yeon Woo...

343
00:27:55,570 --> 00:28:01,260
Our Yeon Woo,
came to see me.

344
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:04,130
Mother...

345
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,710
It seemed like...

346
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,250
she had something to say.

347
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,340
She wanted...

348
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:20,370
She wanted to say something to me.

349
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:29,250
That sweet child...

350
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:37,160
because she didn't want
to hurt her mother's heart,

351
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,500
she just cried

352
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:45,850
and left.

353
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,379
That poor child.

354
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:54,619
Aigoo, my baby.

355
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,979
Ow!

356
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,009
What is wrong?

357
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:01,029
Did you prick your finger
with the needle again?

358
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,029
Something feels ominous.

359
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:05,569
It's not the first time
you pricked your finger,

360
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:07,859
so what feels ominous?

361
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,780
If I said it's ominous,
then it is!

362
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,349
Look at this.

363
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,569
The embroidery that I'm stitching onto
his official clothes is stained with blood.

364
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:18,149
So, didn't I tell you
to go to sleep tonight,

365
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:22,329
and continue tomorrow
when you're awake?

366
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:24,059
Wha... what's wrong?

367
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:25,629
I'm going to ask Mother to teach me.

368
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,199
Princess, it's already past 10pm!

369
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,739
Princess!
Princess.

370
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,750
Princess.

371
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,129
Prince Consort.

372
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:37,129
Husband!

373
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:39,470
Mother!

374
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,889
What happened to Mother, Husband?

375
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:48,790
I'm bringing her back
from our old home.

376
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:54,500
You haven't been there for a long time...

377
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:57,420
why did you suddenly go back
to the old house?

378
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:00,240
I'm sorry, but
please take care of Mother.

379
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,319
Housekeeper Park!
Bring the key to the old house.

380
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,220
Yes, sir.

381
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,760
That child... why?

382
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,730
The dead child...
why is she in my dreams?

383
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:09,450
<i>I'm sorry,</i>

384
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,380
<i>but while you were asleep,
you called out a girl's name.</i>

385
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,990
<i>It carried the weight of all your pain.</i>

386
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:20,520
And because I wanted to console you,

387
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:26,280
I dared to violate the law of not touching
the royal body.

388
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,379
- You're from the palace kitchen?
- That is correct.

389
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,649
This morning, you served me
the same stew again.

390
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,229
That is correct.

391
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:05,980
Then, do you want me to keep eating
the same stew until I die?

392
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:09,240
If you serve me stew again,

393
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,390
I will chase you out of the palace.

394
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:21,139
Why is His Majesty cold again?

395
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:24,819
We can't ever
serve him stew again, right?

396
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:27,099
When he smiled, he was so much
more handsome than now.

397
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,829
- Yes.
- Yes.

398
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:31,629
"The stew was very delicious.
I ate it well".

399
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:34,470
He said that and smiled.

400
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:38,760
If I can see his smile just one more time...

401
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,260
Your Highness The Queen!

402
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,849
Your Highness, please kill us.

403
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:47,499
You girls!
Where do you belong?

404
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,089
Immediately, punish...

405
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:50,629
That's enough, Court Lady Jo.

406
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:53,499
His Majesty's complexion
has become brighter,

407
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:56,299
so what other news
is better than this?

408
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:00,500
I'm not going to keep it in my heart,
so you do not need to worry.

409
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,519
<i>What did you just say, Queen?</i>

410
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,510
<i>It is shameful for me to say this,</i>

411
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:15,790
but there are rumors
about His Majesty and me

412
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:18,069
circulating in the palace.

413
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:19,499
What rumors?

414
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:24,460
They say that His Majesty is ill
because of me...

415
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:27,459
and that his recent improvement

416
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:32,720
is because he is privately hiding a woman.

417
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:38,319
What do you mean that the King
is keeping a woman by his side?

418
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,289
You know better than anyone about that.

419
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:43,549
Aside from the rumors themselves,

420
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:46,310
if they were to spread
outside of the palace,

421
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:50,269
what will the citizens think of their king?

422
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:55,719
So please, grant me permission to go to
the King's quarters whenever I want to.

423
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,369
It is because I am unable
to stay by His Majesty's side

424
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:02,220
that rumors like these keep spreading.

425
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:03,929
But,

426
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:07,930
the Ministry of Astrology and Seongsucheong

427
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,559
say that it is best to keep you two apart
until you share the same room.

428
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,130
Then, as his rightful wife,

429
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:18,659
I have to continue to bear the disgrace?

430
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,279
Just wait a little longer, Queen.

431
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,249
Once you share a room,

432
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:25,859
the rumors
will disappear on their own.

433
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:30,059
But, there is no way of knowing when
His Majesty's body will become ill again.

434
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:33,079
That...
you do not have to worry about.

435
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:37,129
To tell you the truth, Queen Dowager has
placed High Shaman Jang's spiritual daughter

436
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:40,940
as a talisman in the King's palace.

437
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,749
Did you say a human talisman?

438
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,319
That's correct.

439
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:51,069
The reason His Majesty has improved
is also thanks to her skills,

440
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:54,720
so just have a little more faith and wait.

441
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,899
They say that the workers in the north
are freezing to death. Is that true?

442
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:21,690
The north has always been a cold place.

443
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,769
Then,

444
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:29,499
I suppose the thing I spoke about
last time, the winter...

445
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,800
<i>Pi Han Dol</i>

446
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:35,610
...plan was not even set up, right?

447
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:40,199
Since it's always cold in the north, are you saying
that the citizens should just freeze to death?

448
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:43,089
Send relief so the citizens
can counter the cold immediately.

449
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:44,959
Yes, Your Majesty!

450
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,720
Oh, I left something out.

451
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:52,219
Pi...

452
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,839
<i>I was right.
It is Pi Han Dol</i>

453
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,960
Pi...

454
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,730
Please write up a report
about the damages and submit it.

455
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,579
In addition, at the last meeting,

456
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:09,139
the issue that was brought up
about the Ministers and bribery,

457
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:13,019
I heard that you did not execute
the order to return the bribes.

458
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,939
There wasn't a lot of items,

459
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,699
so is there a need to go through
the trouble of returning them?

460
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:21,609
However, those bribes were squeezed
from the citizens.

461
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:24,640
They did not give them freely.

462
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:27,069
What do you think, Minister Yoon?

463
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:30,869
Your Majesty is correct,
but it wasn't that much.

464
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:32,929
The citizens cannot even eat
porridge made from blood,

465
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:35,049
but you squeezed their sweat
and blood from them,

466
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:37,219
so you must return in full.

467
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,890
The fancy clothes
that you received as bribes,

468
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:42,020
send them back immediately!

469
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,450
We will end the meeting like this.

470
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,670
Oh, right. Royal Court,

471
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,649
there is something I want to ask you.

472
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:53,990
Please ask the court.

473
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:57,930
Is the construction
of Boryeong Palace going well?

474
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,749
If you are that worried about it,

475
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:09,750
what about going to the site yourself
and look around?

476
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:14,490
Oh, that's a really good idea.

477
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,159
But you know,

478
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:22,160
I may be a little late.

479
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:25,700
That's what I end up thinking.

480
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:38,440
That was just like him playing with us.

481
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:41,979
Pi, Pi, Pi! Throwing out that syllable
as though he was going to say his name.

482
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:44,790
He messed around with us.

483
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:49,399
It definitely seems like
he knows something.

484
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,949
But I don't know why we aren't getting
a response out of him.

485
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:57,279
Well, it seems like he is planning
on slowly killing us with words.

486
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,979
About the Boryeong Palace construction,
even if he were to investigate,

487
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,939
he knows he is too late.

488
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:05,359
Hence, are you saying he has given up?

489
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,480
Rather than giving up,

490
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:10,179
he is probably waiting for an opportunity.

491
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:13,110
Opportunity?
What opportunity?

492
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:16,889
Instead of acting like you know something
and posing all the time,

493
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:19,099
can't you just tell us
all at once?!

494
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,769
Opportunity?
What opportunity are you referring to?

495
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:27,400
It is probably the opportunity
to remove the problem from its roots.

496
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:42,240
The Queen requests your presence.

497
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:45,240
What did you just say?

498
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:49,459
Did you say that High Shaman Jang
has returned to Seongsucheong?

499
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,149
Yes.

500
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:55,300
She is using her spiritual daughter
as a talisman to ward off evil spirits.

501
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,980
It definitely must be
the Queen Dowager's order.

502
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:04,020
So Father, on my behalf, go to
the Queen Dowager and make a request.

503
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,679
A request?

504
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:10,010
Even though she is a lowly shaman,
ultimately, she is a woman.

505
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:13,049
I cannot let her stay by His Majesty's side
and watch over him.

506
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,519
Then,

507
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:19,090
the shaman that was sent
to His Majesty's side has to be removed.

508
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:22,270
Is that the request I am to make?

509
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,850
However,

510
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,290
there are the disturbing dreams
I've been having for the past few days.

511
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,399
There is also the improvement
in His Majesty's health.

512
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,239
It is making me uneasy.

513
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,200
As the Queen of the country,

514
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:41,210
are you jealous of a lowly shaman?

515
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:44,109
Even though His Majesty
keeps you far away,

516
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:47,610
do you think he'll turn
to a lowly shaman?

517
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,500
<i>High Shaman Jang has returned.</i>

518
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:59,960
<i>That Jang Nok Young...</i>

519
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:11,189
<i>What brings you all the way here?</i>

520
00:40:11,190 --> 00:40:16,410
When I was in power,
you used to come see me every day,

521
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:19,019
but it's getting harder to see you
as the days go by.

522
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,760
I apologize, Your Highness.

523
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:27,250
The Minister position is not that easy.

524
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:31,210
I know that well.

525
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:35,499
Think about how
you came to that position.

526
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,429
<i>Who helped you get
into that high position?</i>

527
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:41,039
<i>You dare show off in front of me?</i>

528
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:46,770
<i>A toothless tiger still thinks
she is the owner of the forest.</i>

529
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,730
For you to come here,
Minister Yoon,

530
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,519
what did you want to discuss
with an old woman?

531
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:59,639
I heard that you put back High Shaman Jang
to her position in Seongsucheong.

532
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,660
- And so?
- Seongsuchong already

533
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,549
has Shaman Kwon.

534
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,979
She was a temporary one.

535
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:11,049
Her abilities cannot compare
to those of Shaman Jang.

536
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:14,220
However, Shaman Jang,

537
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:18,970
wasn't she deeply involved
in the incident 8 years ago?

538
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:22,079
If she were to say something...

539
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,770
Shaman Kwon is also

540
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:28,969
deeply involved in
Prince Ui Seong's Mother's accident.

541
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:32,849
If we want to talk about dangerous,
the two are the same.

542
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:34,660
However...

543
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,959
that happened a long time ago.

544
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,810
Is 8 years a short time?

545
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:46,660
We need Shaman Jang's talent.

546
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:50,179
In all of Joseon, there is no other
who has her talent,

547
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:52,439
so how can I get rid of her?

548
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,530
Shaman Kwon...

549
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:58,209
has a lot of greed for power and authority,

550
00:41:58,210 --> 00:42:00,579
so she is easier to control.

551
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:04,830
But Shaman Jang
is someone we do not know.

552
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:08,959
Those who are difficult to control
are dangerous.

553
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,789
The more dangerous she is,
the more I need to keep her by my side.

554
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:14,359
Your Highness...

555
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:17,949
What are you afraid of, Minister Yoon?

556
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:20,729
It is all in the past anyway.

557
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:22,750
More importantly,

558
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:28,500
the dead do not talk.

559
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:57,830
You will receive your punishment,
so drag her out!

560
00:42:58,010 --> 00:42:59,820
- Yes!
- Yes!

561
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:18,669
Shaman Wol,

562
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:21,820
received an order to become a human talisman
and entered the King's chambers,

563
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:24,079
but she ignored her duties.

564
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,210
Instead, she committed a crime
of unfaithfulness to her duty.

565
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:31,139
Committing this crime is punishable
by His Majesty's law of the land.

566
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:34,009
Everyone present,
keep your eyes wide open

567
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:36,619
and witness this scene.

568
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:38,129
Start.

569
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:39,770
- Yes.
- Yes.

570
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:04,979
Are you positive that her name is
in the Seongsucheong's registry?

571
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:07,579
- I am.
- What about Minister Yoon?

572
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:11,590
It seems as if they do not know about
the shaman's existence.

573
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:16,739
Please revoke your royal order.

574
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:19,100
That girl is not a spy.

575
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:23,469
I, too, have sinned because I did nothing
when I saw the girl committing the crime...

576
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:26,300
You're taking the girl's side.

577
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,880
That's not like you.

578
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:32,980
I know.

579
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:39,300
The dangerous person is not her
but me.

580
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,729
<i>What am I to do, Ari?</i>

581
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:51,929
<i>If I reveal the truth, she will live,
but she will die soon.</i>

582
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:56,220
<i>If I let this continue, even if she lives,
it won't be worth living.</i>

583
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,669
<i>What am I to do?</i>

584
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:01,970
<i>Please answer me, Ari!</i>

585
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:05,260
<i>Stop!</i>

586
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:08,010
Stop.

587
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:11,470
This is a royal command.

588
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:15,209
Shaman Wol,

589
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:20,050
from this point forward, will return to
the King's chambers and finish her duties.

590
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,920
This is the royal command.

591
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:26,550
- Unni!
- Miss!

592
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,370
Miss, are you alright?

593
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,020
Did you say I've been bewitched?

594
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:54,720
You say that's why
I need to push her away.

595
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,970
I am bewitched.

596
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:05,550
However,

597
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:10,000
I cannot push her away.

598
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:00,030
Mistress...

599
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,270
For a little while,

600
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:07,430
I would like to go out.

601
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:16,669
In your state,
where do you plan on going?

602
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:21,220
Just for a while...
Just a little while will be enough.

603
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:25,349
There is something I must do.

604
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:27,869
Are you out of your mind?

605
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:29,359
After going through that,
you will again...

606
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:31,460
I know.

607
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:35,789
A shaman who serves His Majesty
cannot go out in public as she wishes,

608
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:37,959
and that I am just a lowly shaman.

609
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:43,020
A lowly shaman
cannot overstep her boundaries.

610
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,660
I know for sure
through this experience.

611
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:54,700
Even though I cannot do anything about
the hardships of being a shaman,

612
00:47:56,430 --> 00:48:01,770
the misunderstandings I got
because I am a shaman,

613
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:05,140
I want to be sure to clear them up.

614
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:08,730
Please give me permission.

615
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:12,650
It is my first...

616
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:16,980
and my last request.

617
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:30,209
I was able to bring you out after all that,

618
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:33,839
but you do not want any ornaments
and refuse clothing material.

619
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:37,540
Mother,
you really do not want anything?

620
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,450
Yes. I don't.

621
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,639
So don't worry about me.

622
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:47,819
If there is anything that you need,
please tell me.

623
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:50,759
If you don't want anything,
then I don't, as well.

624
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,340
Oh!
I do have one.

625
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:57,039
The rice paper that Husband uses
is running low.

626
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,849
Since we are out, what do you think about
getting him the best quality one?

627
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:06,230
Since Princess is always considerate
and thinking of her husband,

628
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,939
I am thankful as a mother.

629
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:12,179
Mother.
You smiled just now, right?

630
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:14,770
You will stop being sad now, right?

631
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:18,929
Yes.
Because of me, you're trying so hard,

632
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:22,750
so I have to cheer up for you.

633
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:26,149
They say that if you smile,
luck comes to you.

634
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:28,399
So you must smile often, okay?

635
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:30,829
Yes, I will.

636
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:34,309
First, let's take a trip to the trinket store,
then go to the stationery store.

637
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:36,410
Yes, Mother.

638
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:51,929
Seeing that you're taking such care
in choosing the paper,

639
00:49:51,930 --> 00:49:54,470
you must be writing a love letter.

640
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:57,029
It's not a love letter,

641
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:59,220
but a letter of apology.

642
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:07,710
<i>It's not a letter,
but a letter of apology.</i>

643
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:17,979
<i>Will you wait for me?</i>

644
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:20,360
<i>Wait for me?</i>

645
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:27,520
Oh? Where are you going
in the middle of choosing?

646
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,260
I will be back in just a little while.

647
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:58,800
Many days have passed since then,
so there's no way he'd still be here.

648
00:51:02,050 --> 00:51:07,510
Now that I think about it,
I wasn't able to thank him.

649
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:42,500
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

650
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:48,000
I came out for an errand and I dropped by
the clothing factory, just in case.

651
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:51,280
I really didn't expect you to be there.

652
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:56,420
I'm glad that I am able to thank you
after so long.

653
00:51:56,680 --> 00:51:58,520
That day...

654
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:01,960
Thank you so much.

655
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:07,930
For not keeping my promise,
I am sorry.

656
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:12,000
There's no need to be thankful.

657
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,629
I wasn't able to save you anyway.

658
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:17,800
Did you get badly hurt?

659
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:21,529
Because I was raised tough,
this small injury is nothing.

660
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:25,749
But, how come you're not wearing
your monk clothing today?

661
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:27,550
What?

662
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:31,589
Oh! It seems like you have misunderstood.

663
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:34,159
I am not a monk. At that time,
I was in a desperate situation

664
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,819
that is why I changed my appearance.

665
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:39,279
You're really not a monk?

666
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,059
That's right.
I am still single,

667
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:45,760
and I can rival the heavens
and earth in freedom.

668
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:50,260
Of course,
I can register for marriage too.

669
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:03,440
The wound on your face,
how did you get it?

670
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:08,740
It seems like you have suffered a lot.

671
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:13,770
If you want to escape again,
tell me.

672
00:53:14,970 --> 00:53:17,010
I will help you.

673
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:19,989
Although I am thankful for your words,

674
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:22,699
I am in a safe place now.

675
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,499
So, you don't have to worry...

676
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:27,559
<i>If you want to run away from
these troubling circumstances,</i>

677
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:29,920
<i>if that's the case,</i>

678
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:35,550
<i>I can throw away my prince hood,
the title of Prince Yang Myung, all of it,</i>

679
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:39,580
<i>wrap you up in a parcel
and run away with you.</i>

680
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:42,250
Are you, by any chance,

681
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:45,490
the King's brother?

682
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:49,490
That...

683
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,779
How did you know that?

684
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:55,990
It is my spiritual power.

685
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:58,250
Spiritual power?

686
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,540
Yes.

687
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:05,990
Just now,
I saw some of your past.

688
00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:10,780
So it is just your power?

689
00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:18,269
Although it may not be enough
to repay you,

690
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:20,499
as a shaman,

691
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:23,129
may I give you an advice?

692
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:25,510
Go ahead and give it.

693
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:28,100
Now,

694
00:54:29,810 --> 00:54:34,250
let go of the woman
you have in your heart.

695
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:39,960
For a new relationship,
empty that place in your heart.

696
00:54:42,370 --> 00:54:44,250
Please do not...

697
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:49,480
try to smile
to cover up your real feelings.

698
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:55,940
Deceiving yourself and living like that

699
00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:01,340
is an awful way of living,
isn't it?

700
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:16,140
Your name...
can I ask for your name?

701
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:21,039
I'm sorry, but I have no...

702
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:24,940
<i>I will call you Wol.</i>

703
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:27,590
Wol...

704
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:30,740
I am Wol.

705
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,340
Wol?

706
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:39,509
Oh,
I must return now.

707
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:42,299
I am very grateful
for your help that day.

708
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:47,480
Assuredly, I will pray for you
to meet your soul mate.

709
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:49,930
Then, goodbye.

710
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,790
Wai... wait!

711
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:05,379
- Mother, are you okay?
- I am sorry.

712
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:09,480
- I was in a hurry, so I wasn't careful.
- I'm okay, so you may go.

713
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:11,780
Thank you.

714
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:17,569
How can a woman be so clumsy?

715
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:19,960
Don't you agree, Mother?

716
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:24,139
- Yang Myung Brother!
- Prince Yang Myung!

717
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:25,919
What brings the two of you here?

718
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:27,879
How are you feeling?

719
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:32,529
You disappeared suddenly,
so everyone was very worried.

720
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:35,089
But Mother, I'm a bit busy.

721
00:56:35,090 --> 00:56:37,510
I will go and visit later.

722
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:43,690
Do you have a lover now,
Brother?

723
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:48,200
Yes, she is.
Are you satisfied now?

724
00:56:48,570 --> 00:56:52,490
Looks like she went that way,
so hurry after her.

725
00:56:55,810 --> 00:56:58,810
It must be true, Mother!

726
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:05,770
I should have looked more closely
to see what kind of maiden she was.

727
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:10,230
Is she around the age of my Yeon Woo?

728
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:59,279
<i>That, you do not have to worry about.</i>

729
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,759
<i>To tell you the truth,
Queen Dowager has placed</i>

730
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:07,970
<i>High Shaman Jang's spiritual daughter
as a talisman in the King's palace.</i>

731
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:14,289
Your Highness,
why are you acting this again?

732
00:59:14,290 --> 00:59:18,400
Get out of my way.
If you block me again,

733
00:59:19,110 --> 00:59:21,990
I will bite my tongue and die.

734
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:36,090
Were you surprised?

735
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:39,770
I did not drink the tea
that the physician made.

736
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:43,000
I will continue to do so
from now on.

737
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:48,980
So you will have to be responsible
for what you have said.

738
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:54,370
Didn't you tell me to forget the weariness
of government affairs while I'm asleep?

739
00:59:55,350 --> 00:59:57,520
That is correct.

740
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:02,790
Didn't you tell me to forget about
the pain in my heart?

741
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:05,740
That is correct.

742
01:00:08,850 --> 01:00:11,760
I am extremely exhausted right now.

743
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:15,290
Moreover, the pain in my heart
that I can't bear

744
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:20,780
is completely occupying it.

745
01:00:20,870 --> 01:00:25,030
Therefore, you
need to help me forget about all of it.

746
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:29,030
This pain in my heart,
you have to put it to rest.

747
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:34,720
Do you think you can do it?

748
01:00:36,740 --> 01:00:39,840
Answer me.
Do you think you can do it?

749
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:42,540
Please allow me to do so.

750
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:45,580
If Your Majesty permits,

751
01:00:45,690 --> 01:00:48,379
the misfortune and death that threaten you,

752
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:50,960
I will prevent them from harming you.

753
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:54,249
The problems and worries
that distress your sincerity,

754
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:57,010
I will help you solve them.

755
01:00:57,790 --> 01:01:01,540
Although I am lacking,

756
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:06,680
I am the human talisman who has the duty
to protect Your Majesty's royal body.

757
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:10,290
From the beginning,
one month's time was decided on.

758
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:13,270
So during that time,

759
01:01:13,730 --> 01:01:16,810
I will fulfill my duty.

760
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:36,029
Your Highness The Queen,

761
01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:39,009
I will inform His Majesty
that you are here,

762
01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:40,819
so please wait a moment.

763
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:43,889
- Open the door.
- Th... that...

764
01:01:43,890 --> 01:01:46,470
cannot be done.

765
01:01:46,670 --> 01:01:48,750
Your head,

766
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:52,180
lift it up.

767
01:01:54,390 --> 01:01:58,030
Lift it.
That is an order.
