Why is she getting married?
Settling down on the island?

1125
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:17,038
I mean, if it was up to me,
I'd be telling her to go get a life.

I mean, does she know
what she really wants?

01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:37,038
You see, I think part of her
just wants to let you know

that she isn't going to leave you
alone here, on your own.

I know something about letting go.

If Sophie felt you were okay on your own,

would she want something different
for herself?

Okay, here's the thing.

I thought that I would know my dad
right away,

1252
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:09,712
but I didn't. I just...

1253
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:12,268
I have no idea.
And now, my mom is gonna kill me,

1254
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:14,590
- and they're gonna hate me, and you...
- Hold on. Hold on.

1255
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:16,716
You invited these guys
and you didn't tell me?

No, I thought you would try to stop me.

- I know I messed up.
- Sophie?

1258
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:26,635
Is that what this whole
big white wedding is about?

1259

- You finding your dad?
- No. No!

1260
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:31,835
I wanted to take a boat to the mainland
with a couple of witnesses.

1261
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,673
And you insisted on this sodding circus
so you could play Happy Families.

1262
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:37,957
It's about knowing who I am. And I wanted
to get married knowing who I am.

1263
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:40,793
That doesn't come from finding your father,

1264
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:43,469
that comes from finding yourself.

1265
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:47,797
And the irony is,
I was travelling to find myself.

1266
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,475
I put everything on hold for you.

1267
01:10:53,720 --> 01:10:56,109
Because I loved you
and I wanted what you wanted.

1268
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,553
Now, I don't know.

1269
01:10:58,200 --> 01:10:59,394
You don't know if you love me?

1270
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:02,438
Of course I love you.
I just wish you'd told me.

1271
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:05,792
Is everything okay?

1272
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:08,636
- Sophie, what's wrong?
- Not now, Sam.

1273
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:10,233
Yes, yes, yes, now.

1274
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,311
Because I'm supposed to be
giving you away.

1275
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,391
And how can I when I know
you're not really gonna be happy?

1276
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:17,517
I've heard all this from my mother, and
I think she knows me better than you do.

1277
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:20,319
I know. But I've done the big white wedding,
and believe me,

1278
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:23,949
- it doesn't always end in "happy ever after."
- That is you. That's not me.

1279
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:26,713

in the world. And I...
