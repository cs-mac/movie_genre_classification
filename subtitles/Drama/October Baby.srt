1
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,614
Quiet, please.

2
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:31,344
Excuse me.

3
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,416
You know, if you haven't learned
your lines by now...

4
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:42,151
...probably too late.

5
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,228
Thanks. Real encouraging.

6
00:02:44,397 --> 00:02:46,262
Nice outfit.

7
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,425
- So you nervous?
- Yes.

8
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,196
So where are you sitting?

9
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,807
Front row, center balcony
with Alanna.

10
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,410
Oh, I didn't know she was coming.

11
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:01,809
Yeah, are you kidding?
We wouldn't miss it.

12
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,151
Got your tickets, got your tickets,
got your programs.

13
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:06,717
Programs, $5.

14
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:08,581
- Hey, hey.
- Programs, $5.

15
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,552
- Oh, hey, sweetie.
- Hey.

16
00:03:10,723 --> 00:03:12,918
- I'm sorry I'm late. I got your text.
- Yeah?

17
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:16,353
I had to do a knee replacement.
Three hours. Can you fix this?

18
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,861
They need to quit treating you
like a resident.

19
00:03:19,232 --> 00:03:21,826
- They think I am. Tickets?
- I don't. Thought you did.

20
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:24,202
May I please see
your tickets, quick?

21
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,329
Let's check them out.
Make sure these babies are legit.

22
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,467
You're bronze package.

23
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:33,203
- Problem?
- Minor.

24
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,506
I can bump you guys up
to platinum package.

25
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:38,913
It's a small fee, $22. Basically
better A/C in the building...

26
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:42,686
...better seats and the proceeds
go to a charity, a really cool one.

27
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:45,415
- You're Truman.
- Am I German?

28
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:46,718
Daughter's in the play.

29
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,453
- Yes, I am Truman.
- She's told us all about you.

30
00:03:49,929 --> 00:03:52,659
All right, thanks for buying
the platinum package.

31
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:54,765
Excuse me. Hey.

32
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,925
- Hey, how are you?
- I'm good.

33
00:03:57,303 --> 00:04:00,898
- Did you get a program?
- No, I didn't. I'll just look off yours.

34
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,271
So that took a while.

35
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,706
Yeah. I went to see a friend.

36
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,909
How is she?

37
00:04:15,288 --> 00:04:16,482
She's nervous.

38
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,786
Well, I guess I would be too.

39
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,928
Thank you for joining us tonight...

40
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,230
- Excuse us.
- ...for our production.

41
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:29,632
Special welcome to our alumni
and guests. Good to have you.

42
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:32,362
We are proud
of our spring production...

43
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:35,268
...one of our enduring traditions
at the university.

44
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,501
But this year, we are featuring
some fresh new faces.

45
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:41,704
So join me, as we welcome
to the stage our cast...

46
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:47,285
...as they perform an original play
written by yours truly.

47
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,478
Thank you. Thank you.

48
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:52,386
Thank you. Thank you.

49
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:58,629
So without further ado,
I present to you Annabella.

50
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:27,986
Annabella?

51
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:32,792
- Is that you, Desmond?
- Hello, Annabella.

52
00:05:32,965 --> 00:05:35,763
You can dispense
with the pleasantries, Desmond.

53
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:37,869
It's a bit trifle, don't you think?

54
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:41,063
If you'd just let me explain,
I'm confident we would agree.

55
00:05:41,441 --> 00:05:46,777
You need to know that my family has,
well, certain standards for me.

56
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:49,676
Standards in which I do not meet?

57
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:53,012
Admit it, Desmond. Please.

58
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,824
- I've realized...
- I've...

59
00:06:03,996 --> 00:06:05,623
I've realized...

60
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,968
...that I have certain standards
that you do not meet.

61
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:12,536
- That's not right.
- I'll set sail on my own.

62
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:16,368
It's time I discovered the life
I've always dreamed of...

63
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,476
...but thought impossible.

64
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:32,421
Get it together, Hannah.

65
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:36,454
I'm leaving, Desmond.

66
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:38,496
Leaving?

67
00:06:39,532 --> 00:06:41,625
Where, Annabella?

68
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,768
I'm...

69
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,833
What?

70
00:06:50,643 --> 00:06:51,769
Hannah!

71
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,143
Excuse me.

72
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,809
Hannah.

73
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,715
Hannah. Hannah.

74
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:14,762
Get her inhaler. In the brown bag!
Get her inhaler!

75
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:18,630
- We need Hannah's bag.
- Hannah. No, no, Hannah.

76
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:21,535
No, listen to me. Hannah! Hannah!

77
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:33,808
Hannah. No.

78
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:22,762
Dr. Jacob Lawson, is he in surgery?

79
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:28,240
Thanks.

80
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:45,723
Yeah, but what I'd like to do
is maybe give her the tests.

81
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,053
- Yeah.
- Just to make sure.

82
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,863
Hi, sweetie.

83
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:59,762
I was looking for you. They said you'd
be here. What was that about?

84
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:01,904
Does he know what happened?

85
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:06,144
No, no, no.

86
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:09,679
The full test results
won't be in for another couple days.

87
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:13,785
But your PTF levels were fine
when you stayed here overnight.

88
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:17,855
So Dr. Stewart thinks
it's good for us all to go home.

89
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,023
Is that not what you think?

90
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:23,288
Yeah, no-- No, I do. I agree.

91
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:27,895
I agree with Dr. Stewart. He's a
specialist. We need to do what he says.

92
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:31,161
All right, well,
I'm gonna go get changed, I guess.

93
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:32,964
Okay.

94
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,949
"lf you just let me explain,
I'm confident we would agree.

95
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:22,053
You need to know that my family,
they have certain standards for me."

96
00:10:22,221 --> 00:10:24,587
Standards in which I do not meet?

97
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:26,849
Admit it, Desmond, please.

98
00:10:27,026 --> 00:10:31,053
It's time I discovered the life I've always
dreamed of but thought impossible.

99
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,699
Predictions?

100
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:48,803
Is there something
you're not telling me, Dad?

101
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:53,174
I was thinking about
asking you the same thing.

102
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:56,279
- Jacob.
- Hi.

103
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,987
Hey, Grace.

104
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,682
- Hannah.
- Hi.

105
00:11:02,895 --> 00:11:05,363
It's good to see you all again.

106
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:09,223
Although, I wish it was under
better circumstances.

107
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:15,670
So how have you felt this week?
Any new symptoms or problems?

108
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:19,208
No, I feel fine.

109
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:25,383
Well, I've looked
at your EEG and MRI...

110
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:29,116
...and it looks like
we need to reconsider...

111
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:32,724
...our current management
of the epilepsy.

112
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:39,095
Stress, sleep deprivation and alcohol
can increase your risk of seizures.

113
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,295
Since you haven't had a seizure since
childhood I just have to ask--

114
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,735
I don't do drugs. I don't drink.

115
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:49,204
I don't smoke, I don't...

116
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:53,134
If that's what you mean.

117
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,375
Oh, I see.

118
00:11:58,784 --> 00:12:02,686
BPD, acute asthma, seizures,
multiple hip surgeries.

119
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,088
Most when you were too young
to remember.

120
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,227
I remember some.

121
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:16,131
Hannah, I believe that
everything you suffered from...

122
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:18,293
...is related.

123
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,272
Why am I sick?

124
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:29,440
You were born very prematurely,
24 weeks.

125
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:34,350
Premature birth
or low birth weight...

126
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:38,251
...and a traumatic delivery
can be associated with this condition.

127
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,116
I was premature?

128
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,227
And that's why I'm sick?

129
00:12:43,395 --> 00:12:46,296
Hannah,
we're concerned about you...

130
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:50,799
...because of the physical and
emotional symptoms that you're having.

131
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:55,373
What do you mean "emotional"?

132
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,410
Your father e-mailed me this.

133
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,361
"l feel dead inside.

134
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,533
No, something worse than death.

135
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,062
I am still a child.

136
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:30,870
A child trying to find a place
in this world.

137
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:32,806
I have many unanswered questions.

138
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,913
Questions I feel
but can't even begin to speak...

139
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:38,345
...because there are no words
to express them.

140
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:41,919
Something is missing.

141
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:44,851
Why, God, do I feel...?

142
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,890
Do I feel unwanted?

143
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:51,352
Why do I feel I have
no right to exist?

144
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:55,364
Why do I spend more time
wanting to end my life than live it?"

145
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,928
You--? You read my journal?

146
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:06,242
Hannah, I believe
that what you're feeling is normal...

147
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:08,004
...and is even expected.

148
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,171
What is--? What is this about?

149
00:14:13,085 --> 00:14:14,916
What? What?

150
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:21,524
Hannah, we're not
your biological parents.

151
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:28,565
Hang on.
That's not how I wanted to tell you.

152
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:33,233
Why didn't you tell me
I was adopted?

153
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:40,978
Okay.

154
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,310
You were born premature...

155
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:47,452
...because you were the survivor
of a failed abortion.

156
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:56,621
Your physical, and, I believe,
your emotional symptoms...

157
00:14:56,996 --> 00:15:00,227
...can be traced to this
as they have in other cases.

158
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,926
I can only speak
to your physical symptoms...

159
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,861
...but I'm suggesting
that you begin treatment...

160
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:12,636
...for your psychological symptoms
as well, immediately.

161
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:18,416
Now, I'm prescribing a new medication
to help control your seizures...

162
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:22,076
...and you have to continue
to take your current medication.

163
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:26,583
- Hannah.
- No, I have to go.

164
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:29,893
- Hey, I don't think that's a good idea.
- Don't touch me.

165
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:58,388
Hello?

166
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,120
- Hi.
- Hey, I can't hear you.

167
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,557
I have set your iron on fire.

168
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,026
Can I call you back?

169
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:09,626
Jason, the iron's on fire.
It's in my hand.

170
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:12,596
It's really loud in here.
Can I call you back?

171
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,030
The iron's on fire.

172
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,406
Sure, it's fine, whatever.
Call me back.

173
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,042
Bye.

174
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,438
We didn't even talk about
the e-mail.

175
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:48,334
What am I supposed to do?

176
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:51,965
My daughter is contemplating suicide,
I'm supposed to do nothing?

177
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,374
- I don't think so.
- It's not like that.

178
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:58,607
Hannah, sweetheart, please sit down.
We need to talk to you.

179
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:01,617
You've had 19 years to talk to me.

180
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,221
I can understand
why you'd feel that way...

181
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,416
...but, please, I would like
to talk to you now. So sit.

182
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:10,084
I don't wanna sit down.
I don't wanna talk.

183
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:13,129
- What do you want?
- I wanna see my birth certificate.

184
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:17,200
- Why?
- Because I wanna know who I am.

185
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:19,398
This is who you are, Hannah.

186
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:22,267
Okay, well, I wanna know
who my birth mother is.

187
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,534
I wanna know how I can find her.

188
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,008
- I can't do that.
- Why?

189
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:30,342
Because I can't. I can't...

190
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:35,085
I can't because I have no idea
who your birth mother is.

191
00:17:35,254 --> 00:17:39,782
- I have no idea where she is. She--
- Here, it's your birth certificate.

192
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,557
Thank you.

193
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:04,339
Hel--

194
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:06,381
Who's there?

195
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:09,444
Hello?

196
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:12,280
It's me.

197
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,586
- You can put down the pepper spray.
- Great.

198
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,588
- How did you know I was here?
- You are way too predictable.

199
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,201
- I am not.
- I am not.

200
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:30,133
- Can I come in?
- No, I'm mad at you.

201
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:42,242
- What are you doing?
- I am taking off my shoes.

202
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:47,552
- Why are you taking off your shoes?
- Because I'm sorry.

203
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:50,251
And I don't like
when people are mad at me...

204
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,294
...especially you.

205
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,131
So are you doing all right?

206
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,362
No.

207
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,700
You wanna talk about it?

208
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:06,200
No.

209
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,686
My whole life is a lie.

210
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,361
Why do you say that?

211
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:28,689
The hip surgeries...

212
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:32,567
...the nightmares...

213
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:35,468
...the asthma...

214
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:37,899
...the seizures...

215
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:41,605
...all of it's connected.

216
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:48,244
My parents aren't my parents.

217
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:52,684
They adopted me.

218
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:04,835
They adopted me because my
birth mother tried to abort me.

219
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,868
I guess I wasn't supposed
to survive.

220
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:17,245
And I barely did.

221
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:22,311
All I know, or all they will let me know
is that I was born in a hospital...

222
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:26,890
...in Mobile, Alabama,
which is 12 hours away.

223
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,525
And I don't know
how I would get there.

224
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,696
Or if I did go, what I would do.

225
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:43,764
I just-- I want answers.
I want answers to all these questions.

226
00:20:44,476 --> 00:20:48,572
I wanna be able to get on with my life,
you know?

227
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:56,452
Because right now, I just feel stuck.

228
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:04,292
Like there's--
Like there's no way out.

229
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:12,495
I'm stuck in this place that I hate.

230
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:25,242
I told you I didn't wanna
talk about it.

231
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,322
Hannah, l-- I'm sorry.

232
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:37,726
I don't know what else to say.

233
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:45,564
I imagine things
are pretty terrible right now...

234
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,368
...but they'll get better.

235
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,606
That's really optimistic.

236
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:02,511
Look, things are gonna
work out, okay? I promise.

237
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:04,622
You'll know what to do.

238
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:09,917
What makes you so sure?

239
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,495
I know you.

240
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,391
I don't even know me.

241
00:22:22,974 --> 00:22:27,070
- Who's that?
- Alanna. I'll just call her back.

242
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:29,710
No, no, no. You can answer it.

243
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:32,714
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I mean, you should.

244
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,481
Hello.

245
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:39,755
Hey.

246
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:44,728
No, no, just hanging out.
What's up?

247
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:49,901
Yeah, yeah, sure,
I guess you can come.

248
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:53,003
Look can l...?
Actually, can I call you back?

249
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,930
Yeah. No, I promise.

250
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:58,039
All right, thanks. See you.

251
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:04,643
I am officially the worst
at planning road trips.

252
00:23:05,917 --> 00:23:07,908
Three days before we leave...

253
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:11,522
...and we have no idea
where we're going. Awesome.

254
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,858
Look, get in my car,
I'll take you home.

255
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,661
We both have exams tomorrow.

256
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:25,132
That's the last thing
on my mind now, Jason.

257
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:29,941
I know, but we need to st--
I need to study.

258
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:37,679
Come on.
Just agree, reluctantly, please.

259
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:43,020
Okay, you stalker.

260
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,150
Behold.

261
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:20,490
- What a piece of junk.
- It's vintage classic.

262
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:22,889
It's vintage junk. Look at it.

263
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:25,757
- It's dead.
- It's not dead.

264
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:28,729
- This is your cousin's?
- Yes.

265
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:31,525
What does he look like?

266
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,870
Not nearly as good as the van.

267
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:40,068
By the way, I think I know
where we're going.

268
00:24:56,561 --> 00:25:00,019
- You have a wild side, Hannah.
- What?

269
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:03,531
I know you've got one
deep down in there somewhere.

270
00:25:03,702 --> 00:25:05,727
Don't you ever wanna just go crazy?

271
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,536
No, I don't.

272
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,642
I need you to have a wild side,
Hannah.

273
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:15,610
- Can I hear you say "Mardi Gras"?
- No, you can't.

274
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,544
And are you aware
that you're in a library right now?

275
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:22,483
- So did Truman tell you?
- Tell me what?

276
00:25:22,654 --> 00:25:26,522
Well, spring break.
We finally decided on New Orleans.

277
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:27,953
And we want you to come.

278
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:30,651
Come on, Hannah.
NOLA, Mardi Gras.

279
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:35,093
You know, Mardi Gras
didn't actually start in New Orleans.

280
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:40,969
Yeah, it began in Mobile, Alabama,
which is on our way.

281
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:43,004
So I figured if we got some time...

282
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:45,267
...we can swing by there
and check it out.

283
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:49,606
- It's a pretty cool place.
- Thank you for the history lesson.

284
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:54,275
I'm just saying I don't want anyone
to feel like they're stuck on this trip.

285
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:59,113
You know, like, if someone wants
to go somewhere, they should go.

286
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,623
I was doing just fine
before you came over.

287
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:04,785
Do you think I'm ready
for a trip like that?

288
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:07,625
- I think it's now or never.
- It's now or never!

289
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,200
Come on!

290
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:10,959
I can't believe this.

291
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:12,660
Sir, this is a library.

292
00:26:21,813 --> 00:26:23,280
- Jason.
- Hey, Mr. Lawson.

293
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:24,876
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

294
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,678
- Thanks for getting back to me.
- Yeah.

295
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:31,549
- Let me guess. You're Truman, right?
- Yup. Yeah.

296
00:26:32,223 --> 00:26:34,282
The charity
you were telling me about?

297
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,794
What is going on?
I thought I fixed that.

298
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:43,161
This is the classic upon which
we'll be taking our voyage.

299
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:45,633
Our Millennium Falcon, if you will.

300
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:49,606
Her name is Evelyn.
Hey, who's the old dude, man?

301
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,242
- You remember Hannah?
- Yeah, the spaz?

302
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:56,980
- Yeah, that's her dad.
- Oh, hey, dude.

303
00:26:57,148 --> 00:27:00,242
- Who are you?
- Bmac, his cousin.

304
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:05,283
And I'm driving them to their thing
because this is my baby, you know?

305
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:07,750
I'm sorry, what did you say
your name was?

306
00:27:07,926 --> 00:27:08,950
Bmac.

307
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,960
No, your name.
Your real name. Your actual name.

308
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,963
I go by Bmac.
I mean, seriously, why...?

309
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,897
I came to talk to Jason.
You mind a little privacy?

310
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:21,800
Absolutely, you should do that.

311
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,134
- Whatever, man.
- I'm sorry.

312
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,674
What can I do for you?

313
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:28,904
Hannah's sick, you know that.
So why did you invite her?

314
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:33,684
- What's that guy's problem?
- You look like the Unabomber.

315
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:34,876
Whatever, man.

316
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,120
I don't know.
I figured she might have some fun.

317
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:41,019
- Fun?
- Yeah.

318
00:27:41,192 --> 00:27:44,161
- I was just trying to help.
- You're not helping, Jason.

319
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:48,959
You're not helping at all. In fact, you've
made my position very uncomfortable.

320
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:51,263
I'm sorry.

321
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:57,231
Look, Hannah's not listening to me
right now and l--

322
00:27:57,409 --> 00:28:00,970
- I can't get in the middle of this.
- You're in the middle of this.

323
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:02,875
You are smack dab in the middle.

324
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:06,279
And I got stuff going on
at my house you have no idea about.

325
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:12,720
So I would appreciate it if you would
just take my side on this thing, okay?

326
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:19,361
Fine.

327
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:22,224
Yeah.

328
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:29,173
I wouldn't go 10 feet in that thing
if I were you.

329
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:31,102
She can hear you!

330
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:39,248
I didn't know that sticks and stones
could break your beard.

331
00:28:43,822 --> 00:28:47,155
Here on the John Walter's show,
Revocation Radio, your true...

332
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:54,932
The sun is up and you're still here?

333
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:59,236
Yup. I gotta go to the clinic today.

334
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:04,034
Although,
I wish I was going in scrubs.

335
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:07,375
I had a really good talk
with Hannah.

336
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:09,941
- About?
- About the trip.

337
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:13,983
Told her I didn't think she should go,
be better if she stayed here.

338
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:16,712
I don't necessarily think
she agreed with me...

339
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:18,788
...but I do think she understood.

340
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:22,017
So she's not going?

341
00:29:22,861 --> 00:29:25,830
I told her that we trusted her
to make the right decision.

342
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:27,225
So I think we're good.

343
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,198
- Okay.
- I'm gonna get some coffee.

344
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:33,166
- You want some coffee?
- Sure.

345
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,483
No, don't put in your headphones,
Diego.

346
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:30,487
Attention. Diego doesn't
wanna talk about our problems.

347
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:32,193
This is really a surprise.

348
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:35,196
Everyone wishes
they had headphones at this point.

349
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:38,335
- Fat Man's Burgers. Best.
- You do not know about burgers.

350
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:43,031
Meat is actually meat fillers which are
yellow pellets in a cardboard box.

351
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:45,506
Like, seriously,
when you cook a burger...

352
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:50,405
- ...all the bad stuff drains into the grill.
- It's in your body. It's in your arteries.

353
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:53,551
I'm not listening to you.
You're making me really angry.

354
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:15,737
That's the meaning of life

355
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:19,173
That's the meaning of love

356
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:22,939
That's the meaning of everything

357
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:28,882
And that's all you need to know
about everything

358
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:30,281
Yeah

359
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:32,282
You're really good.

360
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:33,981
Thanks.

361
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:36,126
That was supposed to be a jingle...

362
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:39,354
...for a barbeque company,
but they thought it was too deep.

363
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:42,192
You should go
on one of those reality shows.

364
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:45,268
I don't think so.
Those things are rigged, I think.

365
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:48,298
Sometimes I write songs
based on dreams...

366
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:50,907
...I imagine other people have.

367
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:53,034
Tow truck.

368
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,287
- Are you with the tow truck?
- Sir, step away from the vehicle.

369
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:09,223
- You been drinking?
- Of course not.

370
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:12,192
Why does everybody
always think I've been drinking?

371
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:14,558
- Explain this to me.
- Oh, what?

372
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,491
You can't drive on the beach.

373
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:19,102
They do it on TV. Also running, it's--

374
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,397
Curly Top, do you see
hotels on this beach?

375
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:24,040
- Yes. No.
- Any restaurants or bars?

376
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:26,938
- No.
- It's because it's a land preserve.

377
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:29,375
- For?
- Set aside for endangered turtle eggs.

378
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:31,606
Turtle eggs.
Dude, seriously are you...?

379
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:33,575
Am I being punk'd? Like what's--?

380
00:32:35,219 --> 00:32:36,447
No. That's... No.

381
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,920
- Five thousand dollars?
- He's the owner and the driver.

382
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:42,924
No, Truman! You're the one
who told me to drive here.

383
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:44,391
I don't know your name.

384
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:47,497
I don't have time for this.
I need to impound this car.

385
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:50,190
I ask all of you
to pick up your belongings...

386
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:52,233
...and make your way to the curb.

387
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:55,065
- I'm gonna also need your names.
- Our real names?

388
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:58,265
- Excuse me?
- Sir, can I just say something?

389
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:04,410
This is my first trip like this, okay? I've
never done anything like this before.

390
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:06,482
And the only reason
that I came is...

391
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,983
...I'm trying to get
to Mobile, Alabama--

392
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,986
I don't have time for this.
I'm gonna have to ask you--

393
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,680
No, just listen.

394
00:33:14,058 --> 00:33:16,993
I promise,
I have a really good excuse.

395
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,994
See, I'm trying to get to Mobile...

396
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:25,033
...because I just found out I'm adopted,
like, last week.

397
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:29,071
And this is my only chance
to find out who I really am.

398
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,301
I mean, to find my mother.
And, well, I think she lives there.

399
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:35,338
At least I hope.

400
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:39,973
We probably deserve everything
that you're trying to say, but really, l...

401
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:45,181
I've got $93.50,
no, 40, if this will help.

402
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,414
Ma'am...

403
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:49,992
- ...I'm not gonna take your money.
- Just take it.

404
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:54,028
Seriously, that was in--
I've complete--

405
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:57,690
- Thanks for letting us off the hook.
- Don't talk to me.

406
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:00,560
- Take care of this?
- Yeah.

407
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:03,298
Let's push it, y'all.
Come on, push, push, push.

408
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:05,738
Come on, Evelyn.
You can do it, Evelyn.

409
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,078
I know it's painful.

410
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:10,077
- Truman's not doing anything.
- I'm--

411
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:14,617
- Truman, I've been doing all of this.
- I hurt in my legs right now.

412
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,384
You did it.

413
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:38,206
Hey, Hannah.

414
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:44,545
I think-- I just wanted you to know
it's really brave what you're doing.

415
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:48,378
You know, like, the whole,
you know, thing with your mom.

416
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,788
I hope you find
what it is you're looking for...

417
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:54,556
...because, you know, it's important.

418
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,319
So I really shouldn't eat burgers?

419
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:02,159
I guess it's just so hard for me
to think about eating healthy food.

420
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:06,064
I mean, like, it just weirds me out.
Like-- And tofu?

421
00:35:06,237 --> 00:35:09,172
I mean, who came up with the idea
to take a bean...

422
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:13,743
...and turn it into a sandwich that
tastes like a hamburger, remotely?

423
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:17,741
Vegans always try to tell you that,
like, tofu tastes like real beef.

424
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,549
That is untrue.

425
00:35:28,192 --> 00:35:29,352
Know a guy named Jo-Jo?

426
00:35:29,527 --> 00:35:32,519
I've never even heard
of a guy named Jo-Jo.

427
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:38,757
This is literally the worst hotel
I've ever seen.

428
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:42,864
It looked better on the Internet.

429
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:46,836
Where? At normanbateshotel.com?

430
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:50,141
Hotelmonkey.biz.

431
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,344
I'm sleeping in the car.

432
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:06,355
Hannah, you will be rooming
with Alanna.

433
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:07,589
There another option?

434
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:10,393
No, Danielle paid double
for her own room.

435
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:13,435
I'm sleeping here in the van,
so you can have my room.

436
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:16,266
That won't work
because you're staying with me...

437
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,809
...and neither Hannah nor Alanna would
wanna stay with me, would you?

438
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,441
Get away from me, Truman.

439
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,918
Respect Evelyn!

440
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,899
That's a lot of pills.

441
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:55,539
Yeah, it's ridiculous, huh?

442
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:02,683
You know what I think?
I think you just like to use this stuff.

443
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:05,720
That way, people have
to be nice to you, you know?

444
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,519
Like, poor little Hannah,
so wounded.

445
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:11,525
I'm sorry, I didn't mean--

446
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:16,929
Okay, you never mean to do anything.
But that's the point. You still do.

447
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:19,496
Why did you even
come on this trip anyway?

448
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,729
Jason invited me.

449
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,771
We didn't want you to.

450
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:27,239
He's just...

451
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,242
...too nice to say it.

452
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:51,364
I usually get up early,
but I can set an alarm if you want.

453
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:53,366
Hannah, just go to sleep.

454
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:55,505
What is wrong with you?

455
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:13,785
- What's going on?
- It's just me.

456
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:17,884
- What are you doing?
- Getting some stuff. Go back to sleep.

457
00:38:23,934 --> 00:38:25,026
Hannah?

458
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:28,668
- Hannah, what's going on?
- I'm leaving.

459
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:31,034
It's the middle of the night.
Can we talk?

460
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:32,501
I don't wanna talk.

461
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:36,010
I'm leaving and you're staying here
with your girlfriend.

462
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:40,278
I realized that I am a problem
and that I never should have come...

463
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:44,285
...so you can just go to New Orleans
with everybody else in your posse...

464
00:38:44,455 --> 00:38:47,549
...and just have fun or whatever.
I don't even care anymore.

465
00:38:47,725 --> 00:38:50,523
You're not making sense.
What is wrong?

466
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:52,390
Apparently, I'm what's wrong.

467
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:54,656
Look, I'm leaving.

468
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:55,924
Don't follow me.

469
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:08,578
Dude, her dad's gonna kill you, man.
He's scary, man.

470
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:46,640
Sorry it took me so long.

471
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:52,081
The only rental place that was open
was by the airport, so it took a while.

472
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:55,948
- I don't need your charity, Jason.
- Yeah, you do.

473
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:59,096
What, so we're just gonna go
to Mobile together, or what?

474
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:00,794
Beats walking.

475
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:04,662
- What would Alanna think?
- It doesn't matter what she thinks.

476
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:07,929
This was my decision, all right?
She knows that.

477
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:10,505
Now, get in.
I don't have time for this.

478
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:14,872
- Why do you care?
- I care about you, all right?

479
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:19,104
You know, I'm not the kind of girl
who gets in a car with anybody.

480
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:22,111
Right, but you will hitchhike
by yourself.

481
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:26,081
- I wasn't hitchhiking, I was walking.
- Okay. No, that's equally smart.

482
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:27,788
I would have been fine.

483
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:24,010
Do you remember
when we were 9, I think?

484
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:26,149
When you were 9,
I was 8 and a half.

485
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:30,679
Yes. Thank you
for that unnecessary correction.

486
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:33,016
I was 9, you were 8 and a half...

487
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,886
...and we would go
with the Thompson kids.

488
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,221
- Remember, and we'd--
- Race to the water?

489
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:40,086
Yeah.

490
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:42,164
This all just reminded me of it.

491
00:42:26,777 --> 00:42:28,005
- Hi.
- Hi.

492
00:42:28,178 --> 00:42:30,112
I have $90 and change...

493
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:34,911
...or something like that and a phone
that doesn't work. The ocean broke it.

494
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:37,519
The ocean broke it?

495
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:42,556
- Do you have a towel?
- The cheapest we have is 110.

496
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:47,026
Unless you are AAA.

497
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:49,529
- Yeah, we are. We have all three As.
- Yeah.

498
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:53,262
- We need separate rooms too.
- Yes, because...

499
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:57,300
- ...we're not together like that.
- No.

500
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:02,073
AAA is 99.

501
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:05,044
Only one room available at that rate.

502
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:09,083
The only other room I have
is the luxury suite.

503
00:43:10,187 --> 00:43:12,553
Two-ninety-nine.

504
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:16,181
That sounds great. We just need
the regular room, though.

505
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,693
- The very regular room.
- Yeah, standard.

506
00:43:22,299 --> 00:43:23,766
Maybe next time.

507
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:27,569
I don't know. I don't know. I mean--

508
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:30,102
Easy.

509
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:33,299
Well, this is awkward.

510
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:37,738
Yeah. Definitely only one bed.

511
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:39,945
Yeah.

512
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:53,827
Are you asleep?

513
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:58,895
- I literally just laid down.
- Oh, yeah, sorry.

514
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,964
Are you okay down there?

515
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:09,145
Well, you know, I usually prefer
the king-size floor...

516
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:13,249
...but this is all they had
so I'll make do.

517
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:15,078
That's funny. You're funny.

518
00:44:18,222 --> 00:44:20,656
Do you think I'm being weird
about all this?

519
00:44:21,392 --> 00:44:22,791
Why are we whispering?

520
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,896
I don't know, I mean, you're like,
the popular college guy.

521
00:44:27,064 --> 00:44:28,622
Girls...

522
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:33,196
...they find you attractive
and enjoy your company.

523
00:44:34,038 --> 00:44:36,871
Would you think
it was weird if I said...

524
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:41,273
...I never been
with anybody before?

525
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:44,143
Physically speaking.

526
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:47,681
Which is purely
a hypothetical statement, of course.

527
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:51,150
Oh-- Sorry. I didn't--

528
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:53,414
I didn't mean to get into that.

529
00:44:58,395 --> 00:45:00,829
- Good night.
- Good night.

530
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:08,337
I can feel you down there judging me.
You think this is totally ridiculous.

531
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,936
Like I'm some Christian
home-schooling freak.

532
00:45:11,108 --> 00:45:13,201
- I'm a Christ--
- You thought it.

533
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,969
- I did?
- I thought so.

534
00:45:15,145 --> 00:45:18,945
- No, that was a question.
- Look, here's the thing.

535
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:21,084
What's wrong
not having a wild side?

536
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:26,314
I mean, I'm glad about the fact
that I haven't done these things with...

537
00:45:27,357 --> 00:45:32,920
And-- And-- l-- I have a wild side.
You've seen me play Scrabble.

538
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:34,864
I'm wild.

539
00:45:42,272 --> 00:45:43,466
What are you thinking?

540
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:47,333
- I think--
- You know what?

541
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:50,305
I can't do this.

542
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:54,076
- No matter what the circumstances--
- Hannah, where are you going?

543
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:56,446
Stop judging me.

544
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:22,268
Go away.

545
00:46:24,014 --> 00:46:25,811
Hello?

546
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:29,443
You're not a freak, Hannah.

547
00:46:34,825 --> 00:46:36,918
Well, good night.

548
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:12,555
Was there a problem with the room?

549
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:16,495
No, no. No, the room was fine.

550
00:47:17,534 --> 00:47:19,468
Because there's no refund.

551
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:22,806
No matter where you sleep.

552
00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:51,390
Hannah, I'm-- I'm sorry.

553
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,483
I do have a wild side.

554
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,852
- I can't believe you broke in.
- I didn't. The door was open.

555
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:23,056
It was the back door
and you pried it open.

556
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:26,259
I used to wander into the old OR
at my dad's hospital.

557
00:48:26,436 --> 00:48:30,497
The cool thing is, all the files
and all the equipment, it's still there.

558
00:48:33,176 --> 00:48:37,203
Hello, I'm home.

559
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:41,477
Oh, scrubs.

560
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:44,280
- You got your wish.
- Yeah.

561
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:49,321
Have you talked to Hannah today?

562
00:48:49,493 --> 00:48:52,018
I tried to call her a couple of times.

563
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:54,186
Her cell phone not working?

564
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:57,265
I don't think
that girl's ever gonna grow up.

565
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:02,297
I remember the first time
I held her in my arms...

566
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:07,967
...I couldn't believe something so small
could have such a power over me.

567
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,572
And I did see him smile.

568
00:49:14,384 --> 00:49:17,080
I wonder if she's ever
gonna be able to...

569
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:20,556
...see things from our perspective?

570
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:27,355
I think we should tell her.

571
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:31,660
Tell her what?

572
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:34,604
Everything.

573
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:39,006
No, she couldn't handle it.

574
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:44,570
I think she could.

575
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:47,148
No, she couldn't. Trust me.

576
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:50,478
And I think we need to trust
our daughter.

577
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:53,214
- All right, turn.
- You know we can't see you.

578
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:18,245
Breaking and entering. Do you...?

579
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:20,975
Do you understand
the consequences?

580
00:50:22,285 --> 00:50:24,082
You do?

581
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:29,181
Yeah. No. Not really.

582
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,055
All right, lookit.
Why were you there?

583
00:50:33,497 --> 00:50:35,624
Alanna, don't freak out.

584
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:37,096
Something happened.

585
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:41,761
And long story short,
me and Hannah are in jail.

586
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:44,164
Yeah, well,
it's not like we planned it.

587
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:46,707
You've got yourself into this,
get yourself out.

588
00:50:47,077 --> 00:50:48,567
Alanna, pl--

589
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:59,284
We've gone so far
and the hospital was all I had.

590
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:01,690
It's the only place that I had left.

591
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:04,684
It was a dead end.

592
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:12,662
You know, if you're gonna put me
in jail, please, just get it over with...

593
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:15,368
...because my dad's gonna kill me.

594
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:18,302
"Owen's Free Clinic."

595
00:51:18,475 --> 00:51:20,739
Oh, my Dad's gonna kill me.

596
00:51:21,845 --> 00:51:24,541
He's gonna kill you too.

597
00:51:28,351 --> 00:51:30,114
This...

598
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:33,255
What are the odds?

599
00:51:39,362 --> 00:51:42,160
I had some dealings with this clinic.

600
00:51:42,332 --> 00:51:45,426
There were some bomb threats,
death threats and whatnot.

601
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:49,595
I dealt with a doctor and two nurses
and the reason I recall this was...

602
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:54,369
...one of this nurses was just,
well, she was very kind to me.

603
00:51:57,414 --> 00:52:01,248
Here you go.
This is one of her statements.

604
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:13,759
The signatures are the same.

605
00:52:14,898 --> 00:52:17,162
Why would she sign
my birth certificate?

606
00:52:18,235 --> 00:52:19,827
No idea.

607
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:26,341
Her name is Mary. Mary Rutledge.

608
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:37,184
The phone is unlisted.
There's just an address...

609
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:44,821
...and it hasn't been verified
in quite a while.

610
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:52,330
Good luck.

611
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:56,233
- Wait, what about all the...?
- Don't worry about it.

612
00:52:56,406 --> 00:53:00,172
Look, I'm very sorry for this
misunderstanding, all right?

613
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:04,404
I hope you won't think badly of our city
and you'll come back again.

614
00:53:05,549 --> 00:53:09,280
- So we're free to go?
- Yeah.

615
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:19,326
Jackie out there
will get your stuff and check you out.

616
00:53:21,264 --> 00:53:24,199
Oh, you know what, wait a minute.

617
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:25,493
What will you say?

618
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:30,766
I mean, if you find your mother?
What will you say? I'm just curious.

619
00:53:32,776 --> 00:53:34,676
I don't know.

620
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,540
Well, my wife
has this thing she says:

621
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:43,680
"To be human
is to be beautifully flawed."

622
00:53:44,521 --> 00:53:48,184
And, well, she's five months pregnant
with our fourth...

623
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:51,384
...so I think I understand
what you're going through...

624
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:53,552
...and how hard it must be.

625
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:58,359
So, you know,
life isn't always black and white.

626
00:53:58,535 --> 00:54:03,302
So hate the crime, not the criminal.

627
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:09,272
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

628
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:23,651
Do you want me to go with you?

629
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:50,548
Yes? Can I help you?

630
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,917
- Are you Mary?
- Yes.

631
00:54:55,025 --> 00:54:57,994
I don't know how else to...

632
00:54:58,762 --> 00:55:00,889
Why did you sign this?

633
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:12,872
How did you find me?

634
00:55:14,377 --> 00:55:17,312
A police officer
recognized your signature.

635
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,046
Sergeant Dodd.

636
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:28,680
You do favor her.
She was a pretty girl.

637
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:31,653
Barely 18.

638
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,853
I wasn't much older...

639
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:36,823
...but I was older.

640
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,592
The girls that came there...

641
00:55:38,768 --> 00:55:43,398
...they really knew what they wanted,
you know, they were sure of it.

642
00:55:43,573 --> 00:55:45,734
But your mother...

643
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:48,537
...she was conflicted.

644
00:55:48,712 --> 00:55:52,341
I'm the one that took her in back
and prepped her for the procedure.

645
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:56,383
- The abortion?
- Yes, the abortion.

646
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:03,825
She tried to convince me that she was
making the right decision.

647
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:08,061
But, you know, she was really trying
to convince herself.

648
00:56:08,898 --> 00:56:11,833
She told me
she didn't even know the fella...

649
00:56:12,669 --> 00:56:16,730
...didn't know his name,
met him at a bar...

650
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:20,069
...and had a night together
and then he was gone.

651
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:25,478
I listened.

652
00:56:26,649 --> 00:56:30,745
Listened to her
like I did a hundred girls before her.

653
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:34,822
Nodded, told her I understood.

654
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:42,020
For some of those girls,
I was their only friend.

655
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,034
Halfway through...

656
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:49,661
...well, something
must have gone wrong.

657
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:52,935
I wish I knew what.

658
00:56:55,612 --> 00:57:00,072
But when I went to see your mother,
she was just awakening...

659
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:04,614
...and the doctor was telling her
that it had been a failed attempt.

660
00:57:04,788 --> 00:57:06,915
Was that a normal...?

661
00:57:08,458 --> 00:57:09,982
For him.

662
00:57:14,497 --> 00:57:17,728
There were things
that happened there...

663
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:22,628
...terrible things,
things they had me do.

664
00:57:26,176 --> 00:57:31,443
When you hear something
enough times...

665
00:57:32,816 --> 00:57:35,751
...somehow you start to believe it.

666
00:57:36,853 --> 00:57:40,084
It was tissue,
that's what they told us.

667
00:57:40,757 --> 00:57:45,694
It was tissue that couldn't survive,
non-viable tissue.

668
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:55,168
Your mother came back
the next day.

669
00:57:55,538 --> 00:57:58,029
She said she wanted to finish
the procedure...

670
00:57:58,208 --> 00:58:00,904
...that she had to go to school,
have a career.

671
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:05,673
And she knew she couldn't do that
with the baby so this was the only way.

672
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:09,083
I took one look at her
and I knew she was in labor...

673
00:58:09,252 --> 00:58:12,653
...and too young
and naive to know it.

674
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,822
I had two choices.

675
00:58:16,626 --> 00:58:18,685
I chose to take her to the hospital.

676
00:58:20,196 --> 00:58:22,858
When we got there,
she was ready to deliver.

677
00:58:23,032 --> 00:58:25,023
She begged me to stay.

678
00:58:25,969 --> 00:58:29,928
I was really the only one she had,
so I did.

679
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:35,570
- Your brother came first, I'll always--
- Brother?

680
00:58:35,745 --> 00:58:39,181
I'm sorry,
what are you talking about?

681
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:45,981
Hannah, your mother
was carrying twins.

682
00:58:47,624 --> 00:58:49,956
And your brother came first...

683
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,558
...and I always remember him.

684
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:58,667
He was so teeny.
He was less than a pound.

685
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:03,563
And he was damaged.

686
00:59:04,841 --> 00:59:08,641
His arm was missing,
completely gone...

687
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:13,272
...torn off during the failed attempt.

688
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,813
And he was just...

689
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:25,627
I saw him shaking there.

690
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:31,723
I saw the pain.

691
00:59:35,138 --> 00:59:37,766
And I didn't see no tissue.

692
00:59:39,876 --> 00:59:42,709
I just saw the face of a child.

693
00:59:47,684 --> 00:59:50,881
But you were the big surprise.

694
00:59:51,888 --> 00:59:54,755
Nobody knew about you,
not even your mother.

695
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:59,122
And you came out, big eyes...

696
01:00:00,229 --> 01:00:03,198
...just beautiful.

697
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:22,180
I never went back to that clinic.

698
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:29,052
And I never nursed again.

699
01:00:29,225 --> 01:00:30,852
Was this mine?

700
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:32,617
Your mother's.

701
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:35,958
She gave it to me
when she left the hospital.

702
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:37,997
And then she just left.

703
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:42,126
They looked for her, but she changed
her name and she was long gone.

704
01:00:44,407 --> 01:00:47,342
My brother, how long did...?

705
01:00:48,244 --> 01:00:50,212
- How long before he--?
- Your parents...

706
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:52,348
...adopted both of you.

707
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:57,844
I would come by now and then
and see you in the NICU...

708
01:00:58,021 --> 01:01:00,182
...they were always there.

709
01:01:00,356 --> 01:01:07,091
They sat right by the incubators
and would read passages of the Bible.

710
01:01:08,898 --> 01:01:11,731
They were praying people,
I remember.

711
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:14,761
And he fought hard.

712
01:01:16,372 --> 01:01:18,670
He never did leave the hospital.

713
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:22,140
He died four months
after you all were born.

714
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:33,817
I know where your birth mother is.

715
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:38,156
I saw her not long ago.

716
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:43,730
And she did get that education
and she does have that career.

717
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:48,667
Her name is Cindy Hastings.
Now she works at a law firm in town.

718
01:01:50,473 --> 01:01:53,135
Finally home after all that running.

719
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:04,085
I've needed to have my say.
Thank you.

720
01:03:50,126 --> 01:03:51,457
Hey.

721
01:03:52,061 --> 01:03:54,529
- Hey.
- Are you gonna go see her?

722
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:58,126
Yeah, I have to.

723
01:03:58,301 --> 01:04:01,270
You know, I'm starting to think...

724
01:04:01,437 --> 01:04:04,804
...that I shouldn't have found out
about all of this.

725
01:04:09,545 --> 01:04:11,274
Because...

726
01:04:12,548 --> 01:04:14,413
...deep down...

727
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:17,211
...there's always just been this...

728
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:19,109
...feeling.

729
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:23,088
Nothing that's happened
is your fault.

730
01:04:52,154 --> 01:04:53,917
Come in.

731
01:04:59,128 --> 01:05:00,493
Hey.

732
01:05:04,033 --> 01:05:05,523
You gonna be okay?

733
01:05:07,503 --> 01:05:13,032
All right, well, I'm gonna go sleep
in the ice machine or something.

734
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:15,640
How are you paying for this?

735
01:05:16,012 --> 01:05:18,947
I saved a few bucks for this trip.

736
01:05:19,115 --> 01:05:21,640
Don't worry, I'll bill you later.

737
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:29,179
Hey, Jason?

738
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:36,225
You know what the last thing...

739
01:05:36,399 --> 01:05:39,391
...was that I remember
before I blacked out?

740
01:05:41,137 --> 01:05:43,901
The last thing
that went through my mind?

741
01:05:45,675 --> 01:05:47,233
Falling.

742
01:05:49,545 --> 01:05:52,412
Falling into perfect blue water...

743
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:56,408
...holding your hand.

744
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:01,556
Why have you
always been there for me?

745
01:06:05,161 --> 01:06:06,594
Good night.

746
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:08,260
Good night.

747
01:07:15,664 --> 01:07:17,131
Can I help you?

748
01:07:17,299 --> 01:07:19,233
I'm here to see Cindy Hastings.

749
01:07:19,402 --> 01:07:22,633
Oh, she's out at the moment.
Would you like to wait?

750
01:07:24,273 --> 01:07:27,640
Do you have a restroom I could use?
Thanks.

751
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:32,677
Conwell and Hastings,
Attorney at Law. How may I help you?

752
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:36,518
Yeah, she's really booked up
for the day, though.

753
01:07:37,153 --> 01:07:38,620
Monday?

754
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:32,069
Hi, can I help you?

755
01:08:34,643 --> 01:08:39,307
I-- I'm sorry, Stacey didn't tell me
that I had another appointment.

756
01:08:39,482 --> 01:08:43,418
I'm sorry that I'm just, like,
in your office like this.

757
01:08:44,286 --> 01:08:47,483
I'm Hannah. I'm Hannah Lawson.

758
01:08:47,656 --> 01:08:49,715
Are you one of the new interns?

759
01:08:49,892 --> 01:08:53,692
You know, I would love to talk
but I have a lunch appointment.

760
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:56,255
I was...

761
01:08:56,866 --> 01:09:02,168
I was born October the seventh, 1991...

762
01:09:02,671 --> 01:09:05,469
...at Mobile General Hospital.

763
01:09:08,911 --> 01:09:13,507
I guess I came here because I hoped
that that meant something to you.

764
01:09:29,398 --> 01:09:32,231
Stacey, could you
please cancel my lunch...

765
01:09:32,401 --> 01:09:34,460
...and hold all my calls.

766
01:09:40,442 --> 01:09:42,740
I don't know what you wanted.

767
01:09:44,813 --> 01:09:48,909
Hey, honey, you ready? We gotta go.
Lilly's waiting for us in the lobby.

768
01:09:49,285 --> 01:09:52,777
Oh, I'm sorry. Who's this?

769
01:09:53,656 --> 01:09:55,521
I...

770
01:10:03,265 --> 01:10:05,665
I have-- I have no idea.

771
01:10:06,535 --> 01:10:08,400
I don't know.

772
01:10:09,305 --> 01:10:10,795
I'm Hannah.

773
01:10:12,341 --> 01:10:13,899
Hi, Hannah.

774
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:18,707
I don't know where you got your
information from but it's not correct.

775
01:10:18,881 --> 01:10:21,679
I don't know what you're referring to.

776
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:25,217
I can't take
any more cases right now...

777
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:28,447
...but Raymond down the hallway,
perhaps he can.

778
01:10:28,624 --> 01:10:31,354
He can help you
with your civil dispute.

779
01:10:31,727 --> 01:10:33,558
I'm sorry.

780
01:11:32,521 --> 01:11:34,716
Hannah! Hey.

781
01:11:36,859 --> 01:11:38,827
Look, I'm really sorry.

782
01:11:38,994 --> 01:11:39,961
Yeah, she just--

783
01:11:40,329 --> 01:11:41,990
- She didn't even say anything--
- No.

784
01:11:44,566 --> 01:11:47,467
- It wasn't me. I swear.
- What are you, following me now?

785
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:49,570
- In the car. I'm taking you home.
- No.

786
01:11:49,738 --> 01:11:52,332
I'm not going.
How do you even know where we are?

787
01:11:52,508 --> 01:11:56,308
His girlfriend called me to tell me
and that you had been arrested.

788
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:57,945
I can't believe you would lie.

789
01:11:58,314 --> 01:12:00,874
- You can't believe I would lie to you?
- In the car.

790
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:03,678
- We're going home, now. Come on.
- No.

791
01:12:03,852 --> 01:12:06,013
- Get in the car now.
- Fine.

792
01:12:06,388 --> 01:12:07,719
Fine.

793
01:12:09,792 --> 01:12:12,022
- Mr. Lawson.
- Stay out of this, Jason.

794
01:12:12,394 --> 01:12:14,954
- Mr. Lawson, look--
- I said, stay out of it!

795
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:19,032
- I know how you must feel.
- You have no idea how I must feel...

796
01:12:19,401 --> 01:12:23,497
...and you can't know until you have a
daughter of your own. So stay out of it!

797
01:12:23,972 --> 01:12:26,338
She's not your daughter.

798
01:12:26,942 --> 01:12:30,935
And she has every right
to find out who she is.

799
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:39,453
I'm gonna make this very simple.
You stay away from my daughter.

800
01:12:39,621 --> 01:12:42,886
You make no contact whatsoever.
Do you understand me?

801
01:12:43,058 --> 01:12:45,026
You lied to me, Jason.

802
01:12:45,394 --> 01:12:47,794
I expected much more from you.

803
01:12:47,963 --> 01:12:49,726
Look at me.

804
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:11,451
Are we going to talk about this
or what?

805
01:13:15,557 --> 01:13:19,015
Until we get this straightened
I don't think you should go to school.

806
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:23,661
I see no reason why I should
continue funding this sort of behavior.

807
01:13:24,933 --> 01:13:28,130
- What happened down there anyway?
- Why do you care?

808
01:13:29,471 --> 01:13:33,373
Why do I care? I care
because I'm your father. I love you.

809
01:13:33,542 --> 01:13:36,443
If you love me,
you would have told me.

810
01:13:50,893 --> 01:13:54,556
If you want to know the truth,
I'll tell you. It was three months--

811
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:57,130
Three months after we adopted you,
we find out...

812
01:13:57,499 --> 01:13:59,899
...the medical bills
are not going to be covered.

813
01:14:00,068 --> 01:14:02,969
We lose the house.
We have to file for bankruptcy.

814
01:14:03,639 --> 01:14:06,665
I am one year, one year away
from finishing med school.

815
01:14:06,842 --> 01:14:09,436
So tell me, how does that
make me the bad guy?

816
01:14:09,611 --> 01:14:11,442
I'm sorry I was such a burden.

817
01:14:12,181 --> 01:14:16,584
- That is not what I said.
- It's what you meant.

818
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:19,848
Hannah, stop. Stop!

819
01:14:20,889 --> 01:14:23,551
- What was his name?
- What was whose name?

820
01:14:23,892 --> 01:14:25,120
My brother.

821
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:30,723
I found...

822
01:14:30,899 --> 01:14:32,059
I found my mom.

823
01:14:36,905 --> 01:14:40,068
Sweetheart, I always meant
to tell you about that.

824
01:14:40,909 --> 01:14:42,433
Right.

825
01:14:45,180 --> 01:14:46,875
Jonathan.

826
01:14:49,785 --> 01:14:52,481
Your brother's name was Jonathan.

827
01:15:15,244 --> 01:15:16,643
Hey, guys.

828
01:15:16,812 --> 01:15:20,543
- Oh, look, the prodigal returns.
- Hey.

829
01:15:20,716 --> 01:15:23,480
- Where's Alanna?
- Good to see you too buddy.

830
01:15:24,086 --> 01:15:26,145
You know, if you had been here...

831
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,717
...maybe I wouldn't
have had the audacity...

832
01:15:28,891 --> 01:15:32,759
...to drink something called
a hand grenade.

833
01:15:32,928 --> 01:15:35,897
That would've been a good thing,
because three sips in...

834
01:15:36,064 --> 01:15:38,760
...you don't know
who you are anymore.

835
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:42,765
When I say I have
no recollection of those events...

836
01:15:42,938 --> 01:15:46,965
...I mean I don't remember anything.

837
01:15:47,643 --> 01:15:49,110
Nothing.

838
01:15:50,879 --> 01:15:54,042
Not the argument, not the fight...

839
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:56,912
...not this guy, just a little shiner.

840
01:15:59,588 --> 01:16:04,287
Oh, and look, it comes with a court
date, for free, disorderly conduct.

841
01:16:07,663 --> 01:16:11,099
I have a criminal record, Jason.

842
01:16:11,733 --> 01:16:13,792
I'd like to go home.

843
01:16:13,969 --> 01:16:18,030
Oh, I got your luggage,
it's in my room.

844
01:16:18,307 --> 01:16:19,296
Thanks, buddy.

845
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:25,044
I wanted to say that...

846
01:16:25,948 --> 01:16:28,781
...I went too far and I'm sorry.

847
01:16:33,121 --> 01:16:35,089
- Where are you going?
- Home.

848
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:37,623
We're going home tomorrow.

849
01:16:46,735 --> 01:16:48,896
I'm going home tonight.

850
01:17:15,197 --> 01:17:17,222
Dr. Lawson, it's Jason.

851
01:17:19,267 --> 01:17:23,260
I wanted to say that I was wrong...

852
01:17:24,773 --> 01:17:28,766
...and I won't be seeing
Hannah anymore.

853
01:17:29,211 --> 01:17:30,940
I'm sorry.

854
01:17:43,959 --> 01:17:47,793
- Hey, can I come in?
- Yeah, sure.

855
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:52,759
What's all this?

856
01:17:53,068 --> 01:17:54,865
It's financial aid stuff.

857
01:17:56,171 --> 01:18:00,039
Honey, he's not going
to take you out of school.

858
01:18:00,208 --> 01:18:02,267
He's just upset.

859
01:18:05,881 --> 01:18:08,247
I wanna try to explain.

860
01:18:15,123 --> 01:18:16,920
This is you?

861
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:18,883
Yes.

862
01:18:19,061 --> 01:18:21,962
You look so pretty in this picture.

863
01:18:24,032 --> 01:18:25,932
You look pregnant.

864
01:18:26,101 --> 01:18:30,231
I was. 20 weeks in that picture.

865
01:18:30,405 --> 01:18:31,895
Twins.

866
01:18:32,874 --> 01:18:35,308
You were pregnant with twins?

867
01:18:38,046 --> 01:18:39,741
What happened?

868
01:18:43,085 --> 01:18:44,814
We...

869
01:18:47,022 --> 01:18:48,922
We lost them.

870
01:18:51,326 --> 01:18:55,956
I started volunteering
at this pregnancy crisis center...

871
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:03,728
...and there was this beautiful
cathedral around the corner...

872
01:19:04,272 --> 01:19:06,763
...and I would go there
to pray at lunch.

873
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:09,437
And I'll never forget...

874
01:19:10,278 --> 01:19:12,746
...October 17th...

875
01:19:12,914 --> 01:19:14,973
...I went back to work...

876
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:18,319
...and I saw a bulletin...

877
01:19:19,321 --> 01:19:20,310
...and it said:

878
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:25,085
"Twins, abandoned...

879
01:19:25,293 --> 01:19:27,818
...twenty-four weeks."

880
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:33,158
And we knew...

881
01:19:33,502 --> 01:19:37,905
...you and your brother
would have been the same age.

882
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:43,370
Hannah, you are our miracle.

883
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:49,009
And that's why it's so hard
to let you go, honey.

884
01:19:51,386 --> 01:19:53,513
You mean so much to us.

885
01:19:54,956 --> 01:19:56,389
I know.

886
01:20:01,163 --> 01:20:03,063
Which cathedral?

887
01:20:04,933 --> 01:20:07,128
It was beautiful.

888
01:21:42,163 --> 01:21:43,187
Excuse me.

889
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:49,131
I'm sorry,
but we need to close for the evening.

890
01:21:50,171 --> 01:21:54,505
Oh, I didn't know.
I've never been here before.

891
01:21:55,343 --> 01:21:56,901
I'm Hannah.

892
01:21:58,346 --> 01:22:00,041
Hello.

893
01:22:03,385 --> 01:22:06,548
We have services daily,
if you'd like to come back.

894
01:22:07,956 --> 01:22:10,982
I'm actually a-- I'm Baptist.

895
01:22:11,359 --> 01:22:13,384
I guess you should know that.

896
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:27,099
And why did you come?

897
01:22:28,043 --> 01:22:30,568
I don't know, really.

898
01:22:32,013 --> 01:22:36,643
I guess I'm trying to figure out
how to let go of things.

899
01:22:37,485 --> 01:22:39,419
Things?

900
01:22:40,555 --> 01:22:43,683
I can't figure out how to let go...

901
01:22:44,059 --> 01:22:49,622
...of the fact that I feel hatred
for myself and others.

902
01:22:51,666 --> 01:22:54,191
There, I said it.

903
01:22:55,337 --> 01:22:57,498
What is it that you want to say?

904
01:23:01,009 --> 01:23:02,636
Just say what you feel.

905
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:09,710
Well, three weeks ago I found out
that my entire life is a lie.

906
01:23:10,418 --> 01:23:13,114
So I went on a trip.

907
01:23:13,688 --> 01:23:17,681
I thought if I went that I would get
all these answers...

908
01:23:18,059 --> 01:23:21,392
...and somehow when I got back
I would feel different.

909
01:23:22,097 --> 01:23:24,088
But I don't.

910
01:23:27,235 --> 01:23:30,568
My parents aren't really my parents.

911
01:23:34,309 --> 01:23:39,303
And my real parents
tried to abort me.

912
01:23:42,150 --> 01:23:44,414
And I have a brother...

913
01:23:44,586 --> 01:23:46,486
Well, I had a brother.

914
01:23:47,055 --> 01:23:50,616
He died shortly after the...

915
01:23:54,129 --> 01:23:57,257
I'm angry at my parents
for not telling me sooner...

916
01:23:57,432 --> 01:24:01,129
...and making me think
that I was just like everybody else.

917
01:24:05,173 --> 01:24:08,301
I'm angry at my real mom...

918
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:12,202
...for not wanting me.

919
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:16,446
Why didn't she want me?
What's so wrong with me?

920
01:24:19,687 --> 01:24:21,621
I found her.

921
01:24:24,526 --> 01:24:27,086
And she still doesn't want me.

922
01:24:31,132 --> 01:24:33,123
And I feel guilty.

923
01:24:37,205 --> 01:24:39,332
Part of me feels like...

924
01:24:43,278 --> 01:24:48,113
...he should be alive and I shouldn't.

925
01:24:54,355 --> 01:24:57,483
I wonder if he would have been
a better person than me.

926
01:24:58,726 --> 01:25:01,194
What he would have been like.

927
01:25:04,532 --> 01:25:07,194
It's just l...

928
01:25:07,368 --> 01:25:11,099
I just hate myself
for feeling this way.

929
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:17,472
I see.

930
01:25:25,587 --> 01:25:28,852
This cathedral...

931
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:32,521
...was built in 1893...

932
01:25:35,196 --> 01:25:36,857
...named for St. Paul the Apostle.

933
01:25:40,568 --> 01:25:42,502
It's magnificent.

934
01:25:46,341 --> 01:25:50,835
He wrote a letter to the Church
at Colossae and said:

935
01:25:52,347 --> 01:25:55,714
"Because we have been
forgiven by God...

936
01:25:56,618 --> 01:25:59,485
...we should forgive each other."

937
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:06,259
In Christ you are forgiven...

938
01:26:07,562 --> 01:26:12,829
...and because you are forgiven,
you have the power to forgive.

939
01:26:13,801 --> 01:26:16,531
To choose to forgive.

940
01:26:18,573 --> 01:26:20,404
Let it go.

941
01:26:21,743 --> 01:26:25,543
Hatred is a burden...

942
01:26:26,214 --> 01:26:27,841
...you no longer need to carry.

943
01:26:30,451 --> 01:26:35,354
Only in forgiveness
can you be free, Hannah.

944
01:26:36,591 --> 01:26:42,860
A forgiveness that is well beyond
your grasp or mine.

945
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:46,697
A forgiveness that...

946
01:26:47,535 --> 01:26:50,265
...you can't find on a trip...

947
01:26:53,308 --> 01:26:55,674
...or even in this cathedral.

948
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:02,474
But if the Son shall set you free...

949
01:27:03,251 --> 01:27:06,687
...you will be free indeed.

950
01:27:17,632 --> 01:27:21,932
Well, I guess you'd better
close up then, huh?

951
01:27:36,484 --> 01:27:37,883
What was your brother's name?

952
01:27:39,821 --> 01:27:41,982
His name was Jonathan.

953
01:27:43,891 --> 01:27:47,327
Jonathan wants you
to live your life, Hannah.

954
01:27:47,929 --> 01:27:49,897
Live it to the full.

955
01:28:34,442 --> 01:28:35,704
Come in.

956
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:45,616
I've been giving this
a lot of thought...

957
01:28:46,354 --> 01:28:48,652
...and I wanted to tell you that...

958
01:28:50,858 --> 01:28:51,825
...I am sorry.

959
01:28:53,361 --> 01:28:56,956
I'm sorry that I overreacted.

960
01:28:57,332 --> 01:28:59,630
So you're still enrolled in school.

961
01:29:00,435 --> 01:29:01,561
Thanks, Dad.

962
01:29:02,704 --> 01:29:05,468
And I think
you should probably pack.

963
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:06,698
What for?

964
01:29:14,582 --> 01:29:15,947
What's this?

965
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:21,648
I know that you need to finish this...

966
01:29:23,591 --> 01:29:25,058
...but with your permission...

967
01:29:26,794 --> 01:29:28,955
...I'd like to be there when you do.

968
01:29:35,703 --> 01:29:39,730
But there is this one place
I would like to take you...

969
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:43,802
...on the way, if it's okay with you.

970
01:29:45,546 --> 01:29:47,104
Sure.

971
01:30:15,410 --> 01:30:18,379
The doctor said
there wasn't much brain activity...

972
01:30:20,882 --> 01:30:22,372
...but I saw him smile.

973
01:30:23,785 --> 01:30:26,117
We truly believed
that God would heal him.

974
01:30:27,755 --> 01:30:32,749
We were so young we didn't know what
to tell ourselves so we never told you.

975
01:30:35,496 --> 01:30:38,932
Days became years,
years became decades...

976
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:41,000
...and you still didn't know.

977
01:30:42,503 --> 01:30:44,471
After he died,
I remember holding you.

978
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:48,871
I would hold you for hours,
I would not let you out of my sight...

979
01:30:50,144 --> 01:30:54,581
...because I was afraid
that if I lost you too...

980
01:30:57,118 --> 01:31:00,178
So I would just hold you
because I couldn't let go.

981
01:31:02,490 --> 01:31:04,822
And, sweetheart, I still haven't.

982
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:07,860
And I'm sorry, Hannah.
I'm sorry for the journal.

983
01:31:08,029 --> 01:31:12,193
I'm sorry for keeping so much from
you, for how controlling I've been.

984
01:31:13,067 --> 01:31:15,661
Sweetheart, it's not because
I don't trust you...

985
01:31:15,837 --> 01:31:20,103
...it's because I'm trying honestly
to learn how to trust God again.

986
01:31:21,476 --> 01:31:23,137
So please...

987
01:31:23,945 --> 01:31:25,572
...don't...

988
01:31:26,113 --> 01:31:27,671
Dad.

989
01:31:28,683 --> 01:31:29,980
Yeah?

990
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:34,644
I...

991
01:31:35,223 --> 01:31:38,920
I love you and it's okay.

992
01:31:42,563 --> 01:31:43,587
Yeah?

993
01:31:50,004 --> 01:31:52,529
Thank you for bringing me here.

994
01:32:20,935 --> 01:32:23,062
You're sure
this is how you want to do it?

995
01:33:32,039 --> 01:33:33,768
Stacey, can...?

996
01:35:12,106 --> 01:35:16,202
- Hello?
- Jason, it's Dr. Lawson.

997
01:35:17,812 --> 01:35:21,179
Yeah, listen, I wanted to say
that I assumed the worst about you...

998
01:35:21,348 --> 01:35:23,782
...but Hannah talked to me.

999
01:35:23,951 --> 01:35:27,045
She told me how you treated her
with respect.

1000
01:35:27,221 --> 01:35:29,416
How much you cared...

1001
01:35:30,725 --> 01:35:32,750
...and I think you should call her.

1002
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:34,127
I...

1003
01:35:34,295 --> 01:35:37,753
Yeah, listen, I'm not saying
that I think you have to call her...

1004
01:35:37,932 --> 01:35:41,265
...but I just think that you should.
And I'm not trying to pry.

1005
01:35:41,435 --> 01:35:46,737
I just want to know what your
intentions are about my daughter.

1006
01:35:47,842 --> 01:35:49,400
I love her.

1007
01:35:49,944 --> 01:35:52,970
- You need to call her.
- Yeah. Okay.

1008
01:35:53,147 --> 01:35:56,913
- Yeah, I definitely will.
- Thanks.

1009
01:35:59,053 --> 01:36:00,884
- Stupid--
- Hey, baby.

1010
01:36:01,055 --> 01:36:02,488
- Hi.
- Hi.

1011
01:36:16,003 --> 01:36:18,028
Hello?

1012
01:36:19,373 --> 01:36:21,841
What, a date?

1013
01:36:22,309 --> 01:36:23,776
Like, me and you?

1014
01:36:28,983 --> 01:36:31,076
What about my Dad?

1015
01:36:32,319 --> 01:36:35,777
Yeah, I mean, I do. I mean, I will.

1016
01:36:36,791 --> 01:36:38,383
You sure?

1017
01:36:39,326 --> 01:36:40,884
Bye.

1018
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:01,214
- This is stupid.
- You're stupid.

1019
01:37:01,382 --> 01:37:03,316
- You want to ruin the surprise?
- Yes.

1020
01:37:03,484 --> 01:37:05,281
I dressed for dinner.

1021
01:37:05,452 --> 01:37:07,886
- Five times, actually.
- Five times?

1022
01:37:08,055 --> 01:37:13,823
- I don't go on a lot of dates, obviously.
- Yeah.

1023
01:37:13,994 --> 01:37:15,222
- I'm good.
- Are you good?

1024
01:37:16,297 --> 01:37:19,027
- My dad is scary.
- Yeah, I know that. Okay, ready?

1025
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:22,465
Three, two, one, open them.

1026
01:37:27,208 --> 01:37:29,039
I thought you should finish.

1027
01:37:29,210 --> 01:37:31,110
- Finish what?
- Your play.

1028
01:37:31,946 --> 01:37:35,109
- What do you think?
- I think we need actors.

1029
01:37:35,983 --> 01:37:38,508
Don't worry,
I was in a play once. Kindergarten.

1030
01:37:38,886 --> 01:37:40,911
- Okay.
- I was Sheep Number 5.

1031
01:37:42,590 --> 01:37:45,991
Hello, Desmond, you can dispense
with the pleasantries...

1032
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:48,060
...a bit trifle, don't you think?

1033
01:37:49,897 --> 01:37:51,489
I think...

1034
01:37:52,099 --> 01:37:54,363
- They ex-- Have high...
- "Standards for me."

1035
01:37:54,535 --> 01:37:56,298
Standards for me.

1036
01:37:57,171 --> 01:37:58,832
- I'm pretty terrible.
- Yes.

1037
01:37:59,006 --> 01:38:01,440
Yeah. Well, look,
when I was Sheep Number 5...

1038
01:38:01,609 --> 01:38:05,943
...I didn't have lines.
I just-- I wore a sweaty wool suit.

1039
01:38:06,113 --> 01:38:09,241
I did not just say that.
That is ridiculous.

1040
01:38:09,884 --> 01:38:12,910
"l don't suppose
you're talking to family."

1041
01:40:47,641 --> 01:40:50,405
Okay, I think this is the last of it.

1042
01:40:51,545 --> 01:40:53,376
Call us, all right?

1043
01:40:53,547 --> 01:40:57,313
Let us know who your roommate is.
Try not to pick anybody too weird.

1044
01:40:57,484 --> 01:41:00,248
- I'll be fine, Dad, I promise.
- Okay.

1045
01:41:00,421 --> 01:41:02,184
I've got to go.

1046
01:41:04,458 --> 01:41:06,483
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

1047
01:41:08,695 --> 01:41:10,492
Mr. Lawson.

1048
01:41:37,791 --> 01:41:39,156
Thank you.

1049
01:41:40,427 --> 01:41:43,624
- For what?
- For wanting me.

1050
01:41:49,203 --> 01:41:50,795
- I gotta go.
- You gotta go.

1051
01:42:09,223 --> 01:42:10,622
I love you, baby.

1052
01:42:44,858 --> 01:42:47,656
Well, initially, Jon called me.

1053
01:42:47,828 --> 01:42:50,228
He said,
"We think that you would play...

1054
01:42:50,397 --> 01:42:52,661
...the birth mother in this film."

1055
01:42:54,168 --> 01:42:55,726
Jon e-mailed me the script...

1056
01:42:55,903 --> 01:42:59,168
...and I was so excited
I think I sat down that very night.

1057
01:42:59,940 --> 01:43:03,569
I got to the point
of the birth mother...

1058
01:43:03,744 --> 01:43:06,804
...and I was so overwhelmed
I started crying over it...

1059
01:43:07,181 --> 01:43:11,208
...because the story actually
had been truly written for me...

1060
01:43:11,385 --> 01:43:15,845
...and Jon and Andy
didn't even know my back-story at all.

1061
01:43:16,857 --> 01:43:17,915
And she read it...

1062
01:43:19,426 --> 01:43:21,223
...and literally called me back...

1063
01:43:21,395 --> 01:43:23,727
...just weeping
about the script and said:

1064
01:43:23,897 --> 01:43:25,364
"How did you know?"

1065
01:43:25,532 --> 01:43:27,659
And we said,
"What are you talking about?"

1066
01:43:27,834 --> 01:43:29,699
And she said:

1067
01:43:30,270 --> 01:43:32,465
"20 years ago
I was working in a law firm."

1068
01:43:32,639 --> 01:43:36,575
Which is very similar to the story.
She said she was in a relationship...

1069
01:43:36,743 --> 01:43:40,543
...she found out she was pregnant
and she decided to have an abortion.

1070
01:43:40,714 --> 01:43:44,309
It was easier to get rid of the child...

1071
01:43:44,484 --> 01:43:46,509
...to not be questioned again...

1072
01:43:46,687 --> 01:43:49,656
...rather than to have a child...

1073
01:43:49,823 --> 01:43:53,725
...and be looked upon at that time
like another failure.

1074
01:44:01,802 --> 01:44:03,599
And...

1075
01:44:05,405 --> 01:44:07,771
So many times...

1076
01:44:09,743 --> 01:44:11,973
...I think
especially as young women...

1077
01:44:12,346 --> 01:44:16,908
...we carry that burden...

1078
01:44:17,284 --> 01:44:20,811
...that we're going to look like a failure.
That it's shameful.

1079
01:44:20,988 --> 01:44:24,446
And, you know,
you can hide a secret...

1080
01:44:24,625 --> 01:44:28,891
...for a long time of abortion
unless you verbally speak about it.

1081
01:44:29,263 --> 01:44:32,699
"Nobody knows. Nobody knows
except my husband, my therapist...

1082
01:44:32,866 --> 01:44:35,630
...and some people like that."
We were blown away.

1083
01:44:35,802 --> 01:44:39,533
Said, "l feel like this is God
telling me it's time for me to share."

1084
01:44:39,706 --> 01:44:44,609
And I remember hearing Jon on the
other line going, "Wow." Like, "Wow."

1085
01:44:44,778 --> 01:44:47,747
From the post-abortive mother, it
was important to be sensitive to that...

1086
01:44:49,383 --> 01:44:51,681
...for this to be
a healing movie for them...

1087
01:44:51,852 --> 01:44:55,811
...and so having Shari's voice
and having her play the role was just...

1088
01:44:55,989 --> 01:45:01,484
...phenomenal to make sure that came
across authentic and very sensitive.

1089
01:45:01,662 --> 01:45:04,256
I think as we went forward...

1090
01:45:04,431 --> 01:45:07,798
...and filmed her scene,
she wasn't acting.

1091
01:45:07,968 --> 01:45:09,731
It was as real as you could get.

1092
01:45:09,903 --> 01:45:13,361
It was one of the more moving things
I've ever seen.

1093
01:45:13,540 --> 01:45:17,271
We went into it
and I remember the cameras rolling...

1094
01:45:17,444 --> 01:45:20,777
...and I just,
right as I walked into the room...

1095
01:45:20,947 --> 01:45:23,313
...I just knew that...

1096
01:45:23,917 --> 01:45:27,318
I just knew
that the Lord was with me.

1097
01:45:28,922 --> 01:45:33,359
And that it was just complete
healing in the moment...

1098
01:45:33,527 --> 01:45:39,659
...that I slide down that door
and that I'm crying and I'm feeling...

1099
01:45:39,833 --> 01:45:43,894
...that wasn't acting,
that was my moment with God...

1100
01:45:44,071 --> 01:45:49,031
...and him with me, to say,
"It's okay, it's over...

1101
01:45:49,543 --> 01:45:51,841
...and you've been forgiven."
