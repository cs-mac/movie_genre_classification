1
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,920
I gotta cut loose, footloose

2
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,720
Kick off your Sunday shoes

3
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,560
Please, Louise

4
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,240
Pull me off of my knees

5
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,760
Jack, get back

6
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,560
C'mon before we crack

7
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,240
Lose your blues

8
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,800
Everybody cut footloose

9
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,200
You're playin'so cool

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,720
Obeying every rule

11
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,480
Dig way down in your heart

12
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,920
You're burning, yearning for some

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,920
Somebody to tell you

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,960
That life ain't passing you by

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,040
I'm trying to tell you

16
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,880
It will if you don't even try

17
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,520
You can fly if you'd only cut loose
Footloose

18
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,160
Kick off your Sunday shoes

19
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,880
Oowhee, Marie

20
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,680
Shake it, shake it for me

21
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,320
Whoa, Milo

22
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,080
C'mon, c'mon let go

23
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,760
Lose your blues

24
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,720
Everybody cut footloose

25
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,280
You got to turn it around

26
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,280
And put your feet on the ground

27
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,960
Now take ahold of your soul

28
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,680
I'm turning it loose
Footloose

29
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,840
And he is testing us.

30
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:36,560
Every, every day,
our Lord is testing us.

31
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,520
If he wasn't testing us...

32
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,680
how would you account...

33
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,520
for the sorry state
of our society...

34
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,360
for the crimes...

35
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,640
that plague the big cities
of this country...

36
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,280
when he could sweep this pestilence
from the face of the earth...

37
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:57,120
with one mighty gesture of his hand?

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,440
If our Lord wasn't testing us,
how would you account...

39
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,360
for the proliferation these days...

40
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,320
of this obscene
rock and roll music...

41
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,520
with its gospel of easy sexuality...

42
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,440
and relaxed morality?

43
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,880
If our Lord wasn't testing us,
why, he could take all...

44
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,880
these pornographic books
and albums...

45
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,880
and turn them into one big
fiery cinder like that!

46
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,520
But how would that make us
stronger for him?

47
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,600
One of these days,
my Lord is going to come to me...

48
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,960
and ask me for an explanation...

49
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,200
for the lives of each
and every one of you.

50
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,440
What am I going to tell him
on that day?

51
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,440
That I was busy?
That I was tired?

52
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,200
That I was bored?

53
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,960
No! I can never let up!

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,840
I welcome his test.

55
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,800
I welcome this challenge
from my Lord...

56
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,520
so that one day I can deliver
all of you unto his hands.

57
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,880
And when that day dawns...

58
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,680
I don't want to have
to do any explaining!

59
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,320
I don't want to be missing...

60
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,360
from your lives!

61
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,920
Praise the Lord in singing...

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,120
hymn number 397...

63
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,840
"What a Friend We Have in Jesus. "

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,320
What a friend

65
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,080
We have in Jesus

66
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:43,800
All our sins and grief to bear

67
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,000
I will. You have
a good week now. Bye.

68
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,960
Mrs. MacCormack, your sister
has us so excited about you coming.

69
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,280
- Thank you.
- Did you meet my wife, Vi?

70
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,440
- No. How do you do?
- How nice to meet you.

71
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,880
- This is my son, Ren.
- Hello, Ren.

72
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,640
- Would you excuse me?
- Daddy?

73
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,680
Ariel, will you come
and meet the MacCormacks?

74
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,600
The stunning new gentleman.

75
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,960
This is Mrs. MacCormack
and her son. Is it Ren?

76
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,280
Ren's going to be new
at the high school tomorrow.

77
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,280
Me, Edna, Wendy Jo and Rusty are
going for a soda at the Hi-Spot.

78
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,240
Ariel, remember
you have school tomorrow.

79
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,800
I'll be home for supper.

80
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,120
God, is he excellent!

81
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,200
What, the new kid?
He's all right.

82
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,680
Are you blind?
He is gorgeous!

83
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,600
- Have you seen the new high school?
- No, I haven't.

84
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,640
I almost forgot.
Cindy Addis had her baby.

85
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,840
What was it? Who told you?

86
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,240
- My mother spoke to her mother.
- Is she coming back for graduation?

87
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,160
I don't feel sorry for her.

88
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,840
You can't buy a diaphragm
through the mail. I'm serious.

89
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,840
Did she decide who the father was?

90
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,480
It was Duane Capps.

91
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,640
Wait! I've been going with
Duane Capps. He'd never have time.

92
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,360
How long does it take?

93
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,800
Ladies and gentlemen,
moving up behind us...

94
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,280
you'll notice the
incredible barf-mobile.

95
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,160
Come on!

96
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,080
Hi, girls. Goin' my way?

97
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,320
You lonely tonight?

98
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,080
- You want a race, you got a race!
- What, that piece of junk?

99
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,200
- Step on it!
- I am steppin' on it!

100
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,040
Come on! No guts, huh?

101
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,680
- In back of us, buddy!
- Take this, Rusty.

102
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,560
- Come on!
- You chicken!

103
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,840
- Come on, take you all on, girl.
- Come on! Come on, Chuck!

104
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,760
- What are you doing?
- Come on!

105
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,280
- Edna, slow down, please.
- Throw it, honey.

106
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,000
Stop it!

107
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,440
I'll get closer.

108
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,320
You can do it. Keep coming!

109
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,920
Ariel, will you stop it? Now!

110
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,280
Stop showing off! It's not funny!
You're gonna kill yourself!

111
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,360
Look, please be careful!

112
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,160
He's testing us! He's testing us!

113
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,520
Ariel, there's a truck!

114
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,920
Get in the car!

115
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,800
Shit! Get in the truck!

116
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,400
Get in the car!

117
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,560
Be careful!

118
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,960
Come on! Get in!

119
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,600
Get in!

120
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,640
Jesus, we should never
have let her done that.

121
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,760
- Have you met any of your teachers?
- No, I haven't had a chance.

122
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,040
They've only been here
eight hours.

123
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,560
I took care of that last week.
Registered him and everything.

124
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,160
I made you some of those
Toll House squares I promised.

125
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,960
Lulu, you taste one of these,
you'll burn your recipe.

126
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,880
Reverend, we have a little problem.

127
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,240
I heard the English teacher
is planning to teach that book.

128
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,160
Slaughterhouse Five.
Isn't that an awful name?

129
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,560
That's a great book.

130
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,200
Slaughterhouse Five.

131
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,560
It's, it's a classic.

132
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,680
Do you read much?

133
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,360
- In another town it's a classic.
- In any town.

134
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,480
Tom Sawyer is a classic.

135
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,040
- That's fine.
- Ethel, have some more ham.

136
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,680
You sure Ren
doesn't want something?

137
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,680
We're both a little tired
from the move.

138
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,760
I'm gonna take Ren a potato.

139
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:31,040
Amy, come back and sit down.
I'm sure your cousin's fine.

140
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,400
It's a shock to the system,
moving out here from the big city.

141
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,560
- What if he's starving?
- Amy, you are so lame.

142
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,040
Sarah! Amy, eat!

143
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,840
I can't sit still!
I'm so excited you're both here!

144
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,000
You sure you're not too tired?

145
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,920
No. Ren did most of the driving.

146
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,360
If you ask me,
Ren is a total fox.

147
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,200
Where did you hear that?

148
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:58,120
See how television and those
kinds of books influence children?

149
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,320
What the hell's the problem?

150
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,320
- Chuck Cranston, are you crazy?
- You're sick!

151
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,320
- Ariel, here's your sweater.
- Ariel, I could kill you!

152
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,080
You almost did.

153
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,040
That's what you get
for sniffing spray starch.

154
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,920
After he graduated,
they drained his brain.

155
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,720
- Edna, you gettin' fries?
- You can't have any.

156
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,520
Wendy Jo!

157
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,760
Yes?

158
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,400
Bring me Edna's fries.

159
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,560
Oh, sure!

160
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,440
Where are you going?

161
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,280
- What are you doing?
- Smuggled tapes.

162
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,240
You be careful with that.

163
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,080
Your daddy hears you playin' it,
he'll bust your butt.

164
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,320
He put his hands all over!

165
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,400
Your mother didn't think
you had any money with you.

166
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,240
Yeah, Mom?

167
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,160
You about ready to go?

168
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,080
You gonna wear that tie?

169
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,720
Yeah.

170
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,680
I think you might want
to dress down for now.

171
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,720
Why? I like the tie.

172
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,480
September, when you go to college,
you can dress like David Bowie.

173
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,400
Come on, let's go.

174
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,520
Why don't you comb your hair?

175
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,440
Shit, mister, where are you goin'?

176
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,040
- You're supposed to look.
- Sorry.

177
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,080
Where'd you learn how to drive?
Stay on the right side.

178
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,120
I like that hat. They sell
men's clothes where you got that?

179
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,160
Willard, come on.

180
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,920
- What's your name?
- Ren.

181
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,840
My name's Willard. Hewitt.

182
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,880
- Glad to meet ya.
- How ya doin'?

183
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,680
- All right. I'll see you around.
- All right.

184
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,640
I swear, one of these days...

185
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,560
That tie is fabulous!

186
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,800
I mean it. It's fabulous. Don't let
anyone tell you any different.

187
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,520
Right?

188
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,280
Very good.

189
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,440
Girl, you are on!

190
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,120
Chicago, wow, man.
Must be wild, like the Naked City.

191
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,800
Ah, fish.

192
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,920
I'll tell ya, you're gonna bounce
off the goddamn walls here.

193
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,840
What do you do there?

194
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,000
Oh, I don't know. Same thing
you do here. What do you do here?

195
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,920
- Lot of this.
- Yeah, that too.

196
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,440
I'll tell you, there was this place
called the Blue Heaven.

197
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,320
It was great. Had to steal IDs
to get in, but it was incredible.

198
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,960
It was like a huge
underground circus, you know.

199
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,760
Hot pink neon climbin' up the walls.
And astro music.

200
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,080
And millions of girls,
like from the university mostly.

201
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
If we could get one to dance,
just one, then that was it.

202
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,280
We'd get out on the floor
and we'd really start to smoke.

203
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,040
We'd start cuttin' in,
and these girls would stop.

204
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,360
- And they'd look.
- They'd look how?

205
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,600
You know, they'd start
to warm up a little. Right?

206
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,040
Pretty soon,
they'd start buying us beers.

207
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,240
- They're buying you guys beers?
- Oh, yeah.

208
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,680
Ah, shit.

209
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,920
Wait. There was this one.

210
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,960
This was the best.
Ginger.

211
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,600
Listen. We started dancing, right?

212
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,800
Slow dancing,
like we're stuck to each other.

213
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,000
Eventually it's obvious to me that
she wants to do more than dance.

214
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,880
Right? So we left the place.

215
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:23,000
On the way to the car, she's
already got her tongue in my ear.

216
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,920
We get to the car.

217
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,640
She says we can't go to her place
'cause of her roommate, right?

218
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,920
But she says,
"Hey, that's no problem. "

219
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:34,960
She's got seats in the car
that recline back. All the way back.

220
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,840
- If you know what I'm saying.
- All the way?

221
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,240
Would I shit you? Right?

222
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,200
She rips my shirt open.
She's clawing my chest.

223
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,880
She's biting my neck, and I'm trying
to get over the stick shift...

224
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,960
'cause we're goin'
like a freight train now.

225
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
All of a sudden, she starts
screaming at the top of her lungs...

226
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,680
"Oh, God! Oh, God!
Don't stop! Make Ginger pop!"

227
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,920
Oh, shit, really?

228
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,480
But we did dance.

229
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,400
We danced our asses off.

230
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,840
Willard, how could you let
our new student eat this food?

231
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,160
- Don't eat this.
- We have delicious homemade food.

232
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,040
- Come on over.
- It's so good. Come on, Willard.

233
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,800
Oh, chicken!

234
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,160
Come on, come on. Good boy.
Bring your friend.

235
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,760
- You won't get any of that here.
- What's that?

236
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,880
- Dancing. There's no dancing.
- That's right.

237
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,520
- Why?
- It's illegal.

238
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,000
Jump back!

239
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,120
It's true.

240
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,320
- Has been for five or six years.
- Why?

241
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,640
Go ahead, tell him.

242
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,280
It started when kids
got killed in a car wreck.

243
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,080
Whole town went bananas, blaming
it on the music, liquor and dancing.

244
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,040
Now they're just convinced
it's all a sin.

245
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,680
Who's convinced?

246
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,960
Whole damn town.

247
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,520
You really can't dance here, man?
I can't believe that.

248
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,040
It's true. This isn't the only
place either. You'd be surprised.

249
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,160
Places upstate you can't dance.

250
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,840
Places in Kansas and Arkansas.
All over the place.

251
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,400
My cousin lives in Montana, and ya
can't dance where she lives either.

252
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,880
Yeah? She ever get busted
for bopping?

253
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,800
I don't know.
I never asked her.

254
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,560
You rich?

255
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,520
No. Why?

256
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,880
'Cause I don't think
I ever bought a tape before.

257
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,400
Get serious!
This place is too weird.

258
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,320
Don't you ever listen
to the radio?

259
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,720
No. We got one radio at home,
but it's never on.

260
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,640
- You like Men at Work?
- Which men?

261
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,680
- Men at Work.
- Where do they work?

262
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,480
- They're a music group.
- What do they call themselves?

263
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,880
- Oh, no. What about the Police?
- What about 'em?

264
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,960
- Have you heard them?
- No, but I seen 'em.

265
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,440
- In concert?
- No, behind you.

266
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,800
What? Oh, shit!

267
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,520
- Step out of the car.
- Could you tell me the problem?

268
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,480
Just step out of the car, please.

269
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,600
- Jim, these plates are Illinois.
- So?

270
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,000
You got a license?

271
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,440
Catch.

272
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,640
Hey, I just bought that.

273
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,560
- Playing it kinda loud.
- There a law against loud music?

274
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,840
Watch that attitude, boy! This way
I don't have to take you in.

275
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,840
Twenty-five dollars. They wouldn't
even let me off with a warning.

276
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,760
You can't talk to our police
the way you talk to big city police.

277
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,040
- But I wasn't doing anything.
- Yeah, sure.

278
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,560
Sarah, hush.

279
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,200
There was this bunch of kids
snuck over the state line...

280
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,160
to see some rock and roll group...

281
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,760
and they were stopped on their way
back into town by the police.

282
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,000
They were on church and
school probation for weeks!

283
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,800
You better watch your step
around here, young man.

284
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,800
Daddy?

285
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,400
I'm sorry about the other night
at the drive-in, about the music.

286
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,360
I was surprised.

287
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,080
Yeah.

288
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,200
I don't know what came over me.

289
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,800
I can't always be with you.
I can't always look out for you.

290
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,840
What's the music?

291
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,080
Oh, it's... I think it's Haydn.
Chamber pieces.

292
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,600
And that kind of music's okay?

293
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:08,320
It's uplifting. It doesn't confuse
people's minds and bodies.

294
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,520
I don't...

295
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,880
What?

296
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,600
I see.

297
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,960
Tell your mother to go on to bed.
I still have a lot of work.

298
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,400
I will.

299
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,880
What is it?

300
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,480
- Good night.
- Good night, hon.

301
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,520
Grab my books.

302
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,440
Let me in.

303
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,640
How you doin'?

304
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,720
You the new kid?

305
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,040
I'm talking to you.
Where'd your tie go?

306
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,520
I thought only pansies
wore neckties.

307
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:24,760
Oh, yeah? See that? I thought
only assholes used the word pansy.

308
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,360
- He got you on that one!
- Shut up!

309
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,640
Son of a bitch
is gonna pay for that!

310
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,960
Either you got jumbo coconut balls,
or you're really pretty stupid.

311
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,640
- Who was that douche bag?
- He's a weasel, but watch your back.

312
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,240
- Can you operate a palette jack?
- Uh-uh.

313
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,640
- How 'bout a bag closer?
- Uh-uh.

314
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,680
- Where are you from?
- Chicago.

315
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,600
You're not stupid, are you?

316
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,200
You trying to piss me off?

317
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,680
Boy, a lot of folks are gonna
give you problems right off...

318
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,600
because you're an outsider.

319
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,480
You're dangerous. They're always
gonna worry about ya.

320
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:09,040
Screw 'em. And this is only one
little corner of the world.

321
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,040
Start Thursday?

322
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,640
Sounds okay.

323
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,880
Oh, hi, Ariel.

324
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,800
Chuck Cranston wants to see you.

325
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,720
Meet him the back
of his daddy's field tomorrow...

326
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,480
5:30.

327
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,280
What happens tomorrow at 5:30?

328
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,320
- You'll have to show up to find out.
- And if I don't?

329
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,000
People will know you're scared.

330
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,920
Anyway, Chuck will find you.

331
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,240
You want that?

332
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,680
You're backing up!

333
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,240
Hey, yo!

334
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,840
How come he sent you?

335
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,840
I volunteered.

336
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,080
MacCormack, where the hell are you?

337
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,480
You know her?

338
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
So she tells me...

339
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,800
that I pissed Chuck off, right?

340
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,120
So he wants to see me.
Then she walks away.

341
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,400
He figured you were gonna chicken
and never... Impressive.

342
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,880
Kinda out of it.

343
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,040
I had to go to work last year.

344
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,960
You still move it.

345
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,640
You better watch that. Ariel's gonna
tell her pop and you're gonna burn.

346
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,600
What's her story?
Is she really tough or what?

347
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,640
She's just trying to make people
forget she's a preacher's kid.

348
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,800
- That why she hangs out with Chuck?
- Maybe.

349
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,360
- People think she's a hell-raiser.
- Is she?

350
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,400
I think she's been kissed a lot.

351
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,560
You'd never guess
your daddy's a fire chief.

352
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,360
You'd never guess your daddy's
a minister. Red Boots.

353
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,320
My daddy hates me
wearing these boots.

354
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,480
And you love that, don't you?

355
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,080
What are you gonna do
when I go away to college?

356
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,040
Why do you wanna do that, honey?

357
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,800
Just 'cause. I'm cut out for more
than this small town.

358
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,960
You're as small town
as they come.

359
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,080
A chicken race with tractors?

360
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,280
- How hard could it be?
- Just like a car. It's easy.

361
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,640
Just like driving a sports car.
Nothing could be simpler.

362
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,200
Oh, hell, Ren,
just remember to stay calm.

363
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,400
Calm? I've never driven
a tractor before.

364
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,360
It's easy. Look. This is your
clutch, your gas, your brake.

365
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,920
You start off,
you just shift it into high.

366
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Don't worry about your one, two,
three, four. Just put it into third.

367
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,120
Once you get going,
slam it into fourth.

368
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,480
That's your emergency brake.
These operate your bucket.

369
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:30,240
I'll bet he's scared shitless,
and he turns out in ten seconds.

370
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,160
Chuck, you sure you're up to this?

371
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,120
Whose side are you on
anyway, honey?

372
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,040
You had a lot to smoke.

373
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,080
Don't tell me
I had enough to smoke.

374
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,000
I didn't say you had enough.
I said you had a lot to smoke.

375
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,000
Don't tell me that either!

376
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,960
Why don't you go tell dog-face
we're ready to go! Yeah!

377
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,280
Just remember he's chicken shit.
Hang in there. You'll be great!

378
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,200
- Just hope to God he pulls out.
- I don't wanna split his face open.

379
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,320
- Cool it, Tarzan!
- Give him hell, Ren!

380
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:14,400
How did I get myself into this?

381
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,040
Hey, Woody, come here.

382
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,520
Listen, has anybody
ever died doing this?

383
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,640
Just once.

384
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,840
Hey, Ren! Hey, sport!

385
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,040
When this hat flies in the air,
you better have your butt in gear.

386
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,120
- Come on, Ren!
- Go! Go!

387
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,040
Let's see what you're made of!

388
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,400
Come on, sucker!

389
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,160
Chuck, move it!

390
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,680
You wanna go up, huh?

391
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,120
There you go.

392
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,920
Oh, you wanna go down.

393
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,920
Kick his ass!

394
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,320
That's it! Jump, you chicken!

395
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,880
Sit down!

396
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:24,680
What are you doing?
Trying to kill me?

397
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,640
You stupid idiot!

398
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,240
Get off!

399
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,800
Turn out!

400
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,760
Oh, shit!

401
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:02,040
Help! He tried to kill me.

402
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,880
Excuse me. Thank you.

403
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,440
I don't believe this town.

404
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,760
Hello.

405
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,560
Tell me.

406
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,920
He has team practice
every day until 4:00.

407
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,880
Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays
he's at the Beamis Mill till 6:00.

408
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,480
You already knew that.

409
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,960
He hasn't dated
since he's been in town.

410
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:42,680
And late Friday nights,
by the light of the full moon...

411
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:46,920
he breaks into churchyards and bites
the heads off live chickens.

412
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,160
Come on, what is it? Chuck?

413
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,960
I never did think he had
all his dogs barking anyway.

414
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:59,560
Besides, what is wrong about
getting a little psyched over Ren?

415
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,640
He's cute.
He's from out of town.

416
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,120
Don't tell me that doesn't curl
your toes. I know you too well.

417
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,560
You want out of here so bad,
you probably memorize bus schedules.

418
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,320
And you don't?

419
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,520
Hey, asshole.

420
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,480
Interested in some
really good shit?

421
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,400
Rich, you sly little shit.
You just made a whole sentence.

422
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,120
Don't get smart-ass!

423
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,400
I've been watching you.
I know you're not stupid.

424
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,520
And I got a friend here who can
help you out from time to time.

425
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:46,400
No, thanks. I got my own sources.
I'm getting into hog tranquilizers...

426
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,560
We'll just call this a sample,
and you know where you can get more.

427
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,800
- Rich, I don't want your shit.
- Why don't I just take it?

428
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,240
You're taking chances
being new in this school.

429
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,440
I gotta show you something.
Wait! This is tea!

430
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:08,080
Would I do that with a real joint?
You know what an ounce goes for?

431
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,280
I'm gonna get you.

432
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,160
You wait.

433
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,560
The Reverend was right about you.

434
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:30,600
A bunch of kids was raising hell
at Burlington Cranston's property.

435
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,640
Tore up the fields,
turned over a tractor.

436
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,400
Today someone suggested
to me there's been...

437
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:40,400
some trouble at the high school,
I think it was drugs.

438
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:46,200
You wouldn't know about that?
What did you say? I can't hear you.

439
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,440
- He said, "No. "
- Amy.

440
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,960
I said, "No, sir. "

441
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:55,040
You know, whenever we used
to call your folks in Chicago...

442
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,160
I don't think there was
any trouble, was there?

443
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,800
I don't know what
to make of it.

444
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:08,640
- People are pointing your direction.
- What did they say?

445
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,040
What I've been telling you
about the trouble and drugs.

446
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,000
You seem to be having trouble since
you moved here. And I figured...

447
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,600
You figured where there's smoke,
there's fire, right?

448
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,560
Usually works like that.

449
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:26,600
Look, you know I would never try
to take the place of your father.

450
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,520
Well, there's no chance of that.

451
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,280
Uh-oh, he's taking the car.

452
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,040
Big time!

453
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,440
What are you doing here?

454
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,040
Watching.

455
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,400
I thought I was alone.

456
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,320
Not in this town.
There's eyes everywhere.

457
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,760
- How come you don't like me?
- What makes you think I don't?

458
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,560
You never talk to me at school.
You never look at me.

459
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,680
Maybe because if I did, your
boyfriend would remove my lungs.

460
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,240
Chuck Cranston doesn't own me.

461
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,000
He likes to act like he does,
but he doesn't.

462
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,760
Do you wanna kiss me?

463
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,480
Someday.

464
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,640
What is this someday shit?

465
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,800
I get the feeling
you've been kissed a lot.

466
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,840
I'm afraid I'd suffer
by comparison.

467
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,520
You don't think much
of me, do you?

468
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,560
You think I'm small town?

469
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,760
I think Bomont's a small town.

470
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,920
I'm going away.

471
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,360
I've already applied to colleges.

472
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,920
I applied to colleges my father
doesn't know I applied to.

473
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,320
He's gonna come after me,
but I'm gonna be gone.

474
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,040
Wanna see something?

475
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,760
Sure.

476
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,440
We call it "The Yearbook. "

477
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,200
It started four or
five years ago, I guess.

478
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,320
It's stuff we're not
supposed to read.

479
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,560
This is all out of books?

480
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,320
Most of it.
Some songs, magazines.

481
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,880
Some poems that get made up.

482
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:57,240
"I'll sing to you of silver swans,
of kingdoms and carillons. "

483
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:01,160
"I'll sing of bodies intertwined
underneath an innocent sky. "

484
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,800
You wrote that?

485
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,160
It's not even one of my best.

486
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,840
It's all right.

487
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,560
Wait a minute.
You hear that?

488
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,520
- What?
- The train. You hear it?

489
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,280
Sometimes after football games
we come out here.

490
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,840
Just a few of us.
And we stand here.

491
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,440
Then when the train comes,
we make out like crazy.

492
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,000
Oh, yeah?

493
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,800
Most of the time
we just stand and scream.

494
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,280
Scream?

495
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,200
Yeah. I saw it in a movie.
Real loud from here.

496
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,800
Don't screw around.

497
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,640
Come on.

498
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,160
Come on,
I'll take you home.

499
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,960
- It's late.
- Yeah.

500
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:25,000
It's hard to impose a curfew on the
young people in my congregation...

501
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,520
that I can't even enforce
in my own home.

502
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:36,120
- Have you been drinking?
- No.

503
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,480
- Were you smoking something?
- No!

504
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,880
I wasn't stealing,
gambling, dancing...

505
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,400
or reading books
I'm not supposed to.

506
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,080
I am late!

507
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:49,160
Who were you with?

508
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,480
Ren MacCormack.

509
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,960
- I don't want you to see him.
- Why?

510
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,880
I've heard he's a troublemaker.

511
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,080
Just 'cause he hasn't lived
in this town for 20 years...

512
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,040
doesn't make him a troublemaker!

513
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:04,320
I don't know what
I'm gonna do with you.

514
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,600
There ain't nothing
to do with me, Daddy.

515
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:11,000
Like it or not, this is it.
It doesn't get much better.

516
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,440
What the hell happened?
Why'd you get kicked off the team?

517
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,360
Because somebody's got it in for me.

518
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:35,040
Coach found out I brought Ariel
home late, so I'm a troublemaker.

519
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,880
That's not why
I'm off the team. No, no.

520
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,200
I'm off’ cause they don't have funds
for one more gymnast, but thank you.

521
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,080
I'm busting my balls trying to fit
in and every door slams in my face.

522
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,120
Hey, MacCormack!
Sorry to hear you got caught.

523
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,080
Don't fool around
with the preacher's daughter!

524
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,280
How does anybody live in this town?

525
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,920
You know what it is?
You got an attitude problem.

526
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,120
- I got an attitude problem?
- I'm not the only one who's noticed.

527
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,080
We're not living in the goddamn
Middle Ages. We got TV, Family Feud.

528
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,320
We're not stuck in
Leave It to Beaver land here.

529
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,880
Well, I haven't noticed
a wet T-shirt contest in town yet.

530
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,760
I haven't either,
but I'm waiting patiently.

531
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,680
I tell you what I'd like to do.

532
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,760
Glue a Playboy centerfold inside
each of Reverend Moore's hymnals.

533
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:25,720
Yeah, you know what else
we could do?

534
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:29,160
We could start one of your
nightclubs right in the church.

535
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,680
That's it.
That's it, man.

536
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,920
What's it?

537
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,080
A dance.

538
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,480
- What?
- A dance!

539
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:42,800
We could have a dance!
You know, a dance?

540
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:46,040
- You know what I mean! Dance! Dance!
- You're gonna get me angry!

541
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,280
Gonna turn this town upside down!

542
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,720
Stop it!

543
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:57,040
I was down in Denver last year...

544
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:00,240
for about a week
at a Bible convention.

545
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:03,120
And the whole time I was there,
people would come up...

546
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:07,760
and ask me, "Reverend, how can
you live in such a small town...

547
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,720
so far away from the hustle
and bustle of the 20th century?"

548
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,920
I'd say to them,
"You'd never ask me that...

549
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,600
if you could just once,
just for one minute...

550
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,520
experience the feeling of family
that comes from knowing...

551
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,400
that all of our lives
are tied up with each of us.

552
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,320
That we feel all the same joys...

553
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:33,120
the same sorrows,
and that we care.

554
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,640
Each and every one of us cares
for the other. "

555
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,320
I told them...

556
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:42,640
"I just feel closer
to my Lord out there.

557
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:46,240
And I feel closer...

558
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,200
and safer with my people...

559
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,760
and I think they feel closer to me.

560
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,320
The Lord smiles on us out there.

561
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,720
And that's why I'm staying. "

562
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:03,560
Why don't you have some cake?

563
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:11,600
Roger, the town council
has no intention of bowing...

564
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:13,520
to wishes of a small group
of students.

565
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:18,680
Eleanor and I are absolutely certain
that this boy is organizing a dance.

566
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:21,400
- We're not gonna have any dance.
- We let some punk push us around...

567
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:25,400
it won't be long before every
community standard is violated.

568
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,360
- Boy, are they in a tizzy!
- Ariel, get in the car!

569
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,200
- Got the whole council going!
- There's a meeting I won't miss.

570
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,120
- Where are you taking us?
- Over the state line.

571
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,080
I want you to see
what you've been missing.

572
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,200
I know you're not gonna
let Willard fight, right?

573
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:40,480
- I don't fight.
- Right, and I don't breathe.

574
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:05,200
- Are you gonna dance?
- I drink better than I dance.

575
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,960
Come on!

576
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,640
I'll watch you guys, see if
you can show me something new.

577
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,800
We didn't come all this way
just to sit it out.

578
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:17,200
I'll be out there. Don't worry.
I'm just gonna grab a beer.

579
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:20,800
Come on, don't be an asshole!
They're waiting to dance with us.

580
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,920
I can't dance.

581
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,600
You what?

582
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,800
I can't dance.

583
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,880
At all.

584
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:37,280
All right. All right.

585
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,720
- Buy him a beer.
- Take my jacket.

586
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:55,720
- What's the matter?
- My feet have been hurting.

587
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,800
They weren't hurting in the car.
I wanna dance.

588
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,720
I wanna get a beer.

589
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,120
Waitress, let me have another beer.

590
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:43,000
I can't help myself!

591
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:59,600
Hey, I came with that girl.

592
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,160
Doesn't look like
you're leaving with her.

593
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,400
Hey, I guess you didn't
hear me the first time.

594
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,840
- No fights. You don't even know him.
- Why don't you flake off?

595
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:14,880
No fights.

596
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,520
When was the last time
you seen your dick, partner?

597
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,720
Rusty, he was fighting
to save your honor.

598
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,640
- It's too late.
- I don't fight.

599
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:33,160
- Your dance gonna be like this one?
- Everything but the fight.

600
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:34,600
Forget it.

601
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,280
Ow! Come on!

602
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,080
Up on the roof, oh, yeah.

603
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,120
One hundred proof, oh, yea.

604
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,240
Ain't that fine, oh, yeah.

605
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,320
You cherry slime, oh, yeah.

606
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:49,880
Oh, what?

607
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,600
Oh, yea.

608
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,720
I hate this bridge.
Gives me the creeps.

609
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,920
How come?

610
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:09,160
You've heard this one.
The infamous Crosby Bridge accident.

611
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:12,000
- You've heard it.
- No.

612
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:15,200
You're missing out!
'Bout five years ago...

613
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,040
these kids were playing highway tag
and they were drunk.

614
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:23,560
One car hits the other one, and
they both go over the bridge. Dead.

615
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:28,040
That's when they started passing
laws against booze...

616
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:30,400
against dancing and drinking.

617
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,680
I don't know.

618
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:35,920
My father had a field day.

619
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,840
Your father? Why?

620
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:41,120
My older brother
was one who got killed.

621
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,320
You should've seen Bobby.

622
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,840
He was like Warren Beatty,
only taller. Wasn't he?

623
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,040
My father went off the deep end.

624
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:54,160
He decided we all needed saving,
no matter what.

625
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:58,080
He's gonna personally save this
pissant town and deliver it...

626
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:01,000
to heaven with his daughter
sitting like a cherry on top.

627
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,360
I called over to Rusty's last night.

628
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,720
I don't understand why you feel
it necessary to lie to me.

629
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,240
I don't know why you find
it necessary to check up on me.

630
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:41,120
I'm concerned about
your well-being, that's all.

631
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,000
How come when I'm home you're never
as interested in what I do or say...

632
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,320
as you are when
I walk out that door?

633
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,200
Wham! Suddenly
you wanna know everything!

634
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:50,320
I don't like this outburst...

635
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:53,680
any more than I like
not knowing where you were!

636
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:55,800
Shaw, don't you think
we could wait on this?

637
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:59,560
No, I don't. I'm sick and tired
of you coming in on her side!

638
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:01,800
She'll have to start
answering for herself.

639
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:05,160
I don't know why. You don't listen
to me any more than you do her.

640
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:32,680
I've never hit anyone in my life.

641
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,640
We're losing her, Vi.

642
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,880
- Don't you see that?
- No.

643
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:47,680
I see you chasing after her,
and I see her running from you.

644
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,960
She's become so willful
and obstinate.

645
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,560
She's like her father.

646
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:01,360
The two of you
were so wonderful once.

647
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:05,440
You had so much to talk about.

648
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,640
I was almost jealous.

649
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,920
It's not as if we don't talk.

650
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:18,000
It's just that...

651
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,360
sometimes people run out
of things to say.

652
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,560
Shaw?

653
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:42,680
It's 20 years now
I've been a minister's wife.

654
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:49,160
And I've been quiet,
supportive, unobtrusive and...

655
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:55,240
after 20 years I still think
you're a wonderful preacher.

656
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,520
You can lift a congregation
up so high...

657
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,560
they have to look down
to see heaven.

658
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:08,760
But it's the one-to-one
where you need a little work.

659
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:22,720
- We could really use your support.
- My mother wouldn't approve.

660
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,040
But we're not talking
about a free-for-all.

661
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:28,520
It won't be a drunken brawl.
It's just a dance.

662
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:32,280
Just give it some thought.
Okay? Sleep on it.

663
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:35,280
Just think about it.
Okay, thanks. See you later.

664
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:37,640
Sounds great to me.

665
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:40,040
How you doin'?
Need any help, just let me know.

666
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:42,600
You got it.

667
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,200
Chuck has heard something
that's upset him real good.

668
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:49,320
I want you to tell me it ain't so,
Mr. Chicago Big Shot.

669
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:53,560
He heard you're gonna try and throw
a dance at school. A senior dance.

670
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:57,360
He figured only a dumb fag would try
that. Is that what you're trying?

671
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,280
He sure the hell is!

672
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,960
Excuse me, girls.
Come out, Ren.

673
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,840
You guys stay there.

674
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:07,000
Is he really gonna
get us a dance?

675
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,920
Yep. Ain't ya?

676
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:12,160
- It's about time, MacCormack.
- I'll be there.

677
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,520
Thanks.

678
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:17,360
Don't you have any better manners?
Didn't your mama teach you better?

679
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:19,400
You treat animals like that?

680
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:22,360
How's it feel?
Don't feel too good now, does it?

681
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,480
- What are you talking about?
- You'll have to fight city hall.

682
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,400
What do you mean
I gotta fight city hall?

683
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:30,160
'Cause there's a town council.

684
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,680
It's made up of seven people.

685
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:38,560
Shaw Moore's one of 'em.
Burlington Cranston is another.

686
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:41,680
Personally, I don't like
that lousy son of a bitch.

687
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,160
They meet every third Thursday
of the month.

688
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,920
Something you want in this town,
you'll have to talk to them.

689
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,600
You're gonna get really creamed.

690
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:52,520
Geez. I'm not so good
with words.

691
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:56,040
Keep thinking like that, man,
and you are gonna get creamed.

692
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:59,080
Woody doesn't know
a dance from a dipstick.

693
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:03,480
And you do? You do, huh?
Which way is your left?

694
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,880
Huh? Willard,
which way is your left?

695
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,480
He don't know his left foot
from his right foot.

696
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:11,720
I'll tell you something. If I gotta
get up in front of that council...

697
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,640
you gotta learn to dance.

698
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:26,440
What is this, Roger?
I don't know this book.

699
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:27,880
I hope you wouldn't.

700
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:32,040
Reverend Moore, Mrs. Evans is
calling about that dance at school.

701
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:34,760
Would you tell her I'll call her
back after Junior Bible?

702
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:36,320
What were you saying?

703
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:39,200
This was found in one of
the athletic lockers at school.

704
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:41,120
A book like this should be burned.

705
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:44,120
We should go to the library
and remove this corruption.

706
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:47,400
There's no sense blowing it up
into something that it isn't.

707
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,040
Hello! Careful.

708
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,320
Come on, Max.

709
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:53,960
I'll set up, Vi.

710
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:56,200
I think it's quite obvious
what it is.

711
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:59,200
It's not quite so obvious
how I should handle it.

712
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,240
Reverend, if you'll excuse
my saying so...

713
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,480
when we got rid of that young
English teacher at the school...

714
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:07,440
we didn't get
any support from you.

715
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:10,360
Because I didn't think we had
any grounds for his dismissal.

716
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:13,320
Around here, it caused
a lot of folks some worry.

717
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,720
A lot of folks worry
a little too much.

718
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,760
Doesn't take much time
for corruption to take root.

719
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:20,720
How long is that, Roger?

720
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:23,560
About as long as
it takes compassion to die?

721
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:28,320
- Do I get a cookie?
- No!

722
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:32,480
- Did you drink all the milk?
- Yeah!

723
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,440
- I wanted to talk to you.
- You don't have to tell me nothin'.

724
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,360
I know why
you don't call me.

725
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,400
I wanted to tell you myself.

726
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,560
I know why you don't want
to see me anymore.

727
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:11,640
I'm not stupid!

728
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:15,000
I'm not blind.

729
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:18,200
It's MacCormack, ain't it?

730
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:22,600
You're just dying to screw
MacCormack, aren't you? Aren't you?

731
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:24,640
You're so stupid!

732
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:26,120
Stupid?

733
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:29,000
Think I don't see you looking at him
like some bitch in heat?

734
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,920
You'll wrap those skinny legs
around anybody.

735
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,000
Shut up!

736
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:36,160
Is that what I get? Huh?

737
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,960
I treated you decent!

738
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:40,920
Shit.

739
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,760
Put that down!
Don't even think about that.

740
01:02:54,840 --> 01:02:57,120
- Jesus!
- You think about it!

741
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:07,920
Stop it, Chuck!

742
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:25,640
'Bout through with you anyway.

743
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:41,720
I'm sorry you have
to see me like this.

744
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,800
I'll be okay. I'll sneak in
at home. I'll be fine.

745
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:47,720
- Do I look okay?
- You'll pull through.

746
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:54,920
Thanks for coming for me.

747
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,600
I don't understand.

748
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:01,000
There's nothing to understand.

749
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:03,640
It's for taking on my father.

750
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:07,440
Wait a minute.
I got no beef with him.

751
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:11,560
No, wait. This is my fight, it's
with the town, not with one guy.

752
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:15,840
You don't get to turn my fight
into a "screw you" to your old man.

753
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:26,440
Hey, look...

754
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,920
maybe...

755
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:36,720
Maybe you shouldn't try so hard
to forget your brother...

756
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:41,080
or to try to make your father
forget him, you know?

757
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:47,880
- It's not that easy.
- I know.

758
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:51,880
Do I still get the box?

759
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:54,600
Gimme the box.

760
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:10,880
Nice.

761
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,320
Think you might ever kiss me?

762
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:07,920
Harvey and Bernie
were here for a long time.

763
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,240
They still talking
about that dance?

764
01:06:11,320 --> 01:06:12,680
Yeah.

765
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:20,440
- What did you decide to do?
- It's not gonna happen.

766
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:26,520
That's one more thing Ariel is not
going to forgive me for, but...

767
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:32,240
Can you step out of the way enough
to realize she's doing this for you?

768
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:33,680
Me?

769
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:37,440
I don't see that.

770
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:39,360
I just know that
when kids dance together...

771
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:42,280
they become sexually irresponsible.

772
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:44,320
I can't take the chance...

773
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:48,040
What's so funny?

774
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:53,480
You talk like that's the only thing
that gets them excited.

775
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:57,920
Don't you remember when we used to
look at each other and get excited?

776
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:02,720
It's just the same with them.

777
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:06,200
You're not gonna put
their eyes out.

778
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:25,680
None of this is gonna undo
one stupid accident.

779
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:29,920
I'm responsible for
the spiritual life of this community.

780
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:35,440
Shaw, you can't be
a father to everybody.

781
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:37,440
You can't do that.

782
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:42,880
I thought that at least
you believed in me.

783
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:56,200
I never stopped.

784
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:01,480
Be at the town council meeting
tomorrow night.

785
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:02,920
Only fairies dance.

786
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:06,200
I'll lay you flat, Ariel.

787
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:09,760
Support Ren MacCormack at
the council meeting tomorrow night.

788
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:11,760
You can make a difference!

789
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:15,960
I'm calling to remind you
to come to the town council meeting.

790
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:22,280
Hi.

791
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:24,280
- Still hurt?
- Naw.

792
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:26,240
Good.

793
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:28,200
- Nervous?
- No. Uh-uh.

794
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,480
Look, I...

795
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:33,440
Yeah.

796
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:35,360
Yeah, I'm nervous.

797
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:38,720
I don't know what
I'm gonna say to the council.

798
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:41,320
There's only seven of them, right?

799
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:45,720
- Who else is gonna be there?
- Everybody.

800
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:49,480
Take a deep breath.
You ready?

801
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:57,280
What is it? The Holy Bible?

802
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:05,320
Ah, this is great.

803
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:09,760
This is great! What...

804
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:13,560
How'd you know where
to find all this?

805
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:15,000
Are you kidding?

806
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,520
I wanna tell you something.

807
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:23,960
Thanks.

808
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:35,200
Come on.

809
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:43,480
What the hell is that?

810
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:48,520
- Oh, my God!
- Amy? What is it?

811
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,680
"Burn in hell"?
This says, "Burn in hell. "

812
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:58,400
- Ren, what the hell is going on?
- Somebody's trying to make a point.

813
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,000
Do you see now?

814
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:02,920
You don't wave flags here
without people taking shots at them.

815
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,960
This is not the first time.

816
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:08,640
My business was off, but people
are taking business away from me.

817
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:12,960
Your aunt's gotten ugly phone calls
and today your mother lost her job.

818
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,440
Mom, is that true?

819
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:17,920
Mr. Collins said
he heard things about you.

820
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:19,960
He thought I ought to stay home
and be a proper mother.

821
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:22,200
- What did you say?
- I told him to shove it.

822
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:24,120
Damn it, Ethel, this is serious.

823
01:10:24,200 --> 01:10:25,960
- There's other jobs!
- Where?

824
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:28,960
- Shouldn't you call the police?
- I don't know if it'll do any good.

825
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,560
I'll get Jim Earlhaus over here.
Will you stop?

826
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:33,880
Now will you stop?

827
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,120
I don't understand this town.

828
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:39,680
It's like something's
choking everybody...

829
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:41,760
only they don't know
they're choking.

830
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:43,480
Let me ask you something.
Why this dance in this town?

831
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,120
Let me ask you something.
Why this dance in this town?

832
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:50,240
It's not just about a dance.
Not anymore.

833
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:52,400
I know.
That's what I mean.

834
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:55,800
I watch you, I see.

835
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:05,760
- You're not gonna understand this.
- Try me.

836
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:17,400
When Dad first threatened to leave,
I thought it was because of me.

837
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:22,640
I thought it was something
that I wasn't doing right.

838
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:27,600
And I figured there was something
I could do to make it like it was...

839
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:30,080
and then he'd want to stay,
you know.

840
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:35,840
But when he left
just like that...

841
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:40,360
I realized that everything I'd done
hoping that he'd stay...

842
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:46,680
everything I'd done,
it didn't mean shit.

843
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:48,920
Didn't matter.

844
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,760
And I felt like,
"What difference does it make?"

845
01:11:56,040 --> 01:11:57,400
But now...

846
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:02,160
Now I'm thinking...

847
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:04,720
I could really do something,
you know.

848
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:10,000
I could really do something
for me this time, you know...

849
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:14,360
otherwise I'm just gonna disappear.

850
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:34,960
All right, Virginia, that ends
the discussion on this issue.

851
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:38,720
So the price of a dog license
will go from $3.50 to $4.50.

852
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:41,720
A licensed pet is a happy one.

853
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:44,400
That takes care of old business.
Burlington?

854
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:48,480
Thank you, Virginia.
It was real good.

855
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:53,080
Now we can consider
any new business.

856
01:12:54,680 --> 01:12:56,800
Excuse me.

857
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:00,400
Before we begin, I want
to remind all you kids...

858
01:13:00,480 --> 01:13:03,840
we're conducting
an official meeting.

859
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:07,520
We're not gonna tolerate
any disturbances.

860
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:12,480
The floor is now open
for any new business.

861
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:16,720
My name is Ren MacCormack and
I would like to move on behalf...

862
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:21,080
of most of the senior class of
Bomont High School that the law...

863
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:24,240
against public dancing within the
town limits of Bomont be abolished.

864
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:33,200
Mr. Chairman,
could I address myself to this?

865
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:34,800
You bet.

866
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:38,000
Even if this was not a law...

867
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:40,440
which it is...

868
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:44,760
I'm afraid I would have difficulty
endorsing an enterprise...

869
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:48,920
which is as fraught
with genuine peril...

870
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,960
as I believe this one to be.

871
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:57,520
Besides liquor and drugs, which
seem to accompany such an event...

872
01:13:57,560 --> 01:14:01,960
the thing that distresses me
even more, Ren...

873
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:06,640
is the spiritual corruption
that can be involved.

874
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:11,080
These dances and this kind of music
can be destructive.

875
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:14,200
And, Ren, I'm afraid
you're gonna find...

876
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:17,400
that most of the people in
our community will agree with me.

877
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:18,880
I do.

878
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:24,920
- That's all I have to say.
- A vote is in order on the motion.

879
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:28,280
- Will all those opposed...
- Excuse me, I...

880
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:31,520
- I would like to say something.
- Please sit down.

881
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,520
This is outrageous!

882
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,960
- If you think that we're...
- Eleanor, sit down.

883
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:43,440
I think Mr. MacCormack
has a right to be heard.

884
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:54,560
I just wanted to say a few words
about this motion...

885
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:58,200
so that you wouldn't think
that we were...

886
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:02,680
encouraging destruction
with this idea.

887
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:09,120
"From the oldest of times, people
danced for a number of reasons.

888
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:12,120
They danced in prayer...

889
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:15,320
or so that their crops
would be plentiful...

890
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:17,240
or so their hunt would be good.

891
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:22,480
And they danced
to stay physically fit...

892
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:25,960
and show their community spirit.

893
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:28,720
And they danced to celebrate. "

894
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:34,480
And that is the dancing
we're talking about.

895
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:40,600
Aren't we told in Psalm 149?

896
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:45,840
"Praise ye the Lord.

897
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:48,920
Sing unto the Lord a new song.

898
01:15:50,840 --> 01:15:53,080
Let them praise his name
in the dance. "

899
01:15:53,160 --> 01:15:54,680
Amen.

900
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:58,240
And it was King David...

901
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:02,480
King David, who
we read about in Samuel.

902
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:05,680
And what did David do?

903
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:07,840
What did David do?
What did David do?

904
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:13,520
"David danced before the Lord
with all his might...

905
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:18,480
leaping and dancing
before the Lord. "

906
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:21,040
Leaping and dancing.

907
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:31,120
Ecclesiastes assures us...

908
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:35,840
that there is a time
for every purpose under heaven.

909
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:40,280
A time to laugh...

910
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:43,160
and a time to weep.

911
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:46,360
A time to mourn...

912
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,800
and there is a time to dance.

913
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:04,480
And there was a time for this law,
but not anymore.

914
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:06,960
See, this is our time to dance.

915
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:12,160
It is our way
of celebrating life.

916
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:16,760
It's the way it was
in the beginning.

917
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:23,280
It's the way it's always been.
It's the way it should be now.

918
01:17:42,160 --> 01:17:45,480
You know you were railroaded,
don't you? Huh?

919
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:50,680
When are you gonna wake up
and smell the coffee?

920
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:54,640
Shaw Moore walked into that meeting
with votes already in his pocket.

921
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:57,400
- You didn't have a prayer.
- Bad pun, Andy.

922
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:02,400
What are you gonna do now?

923
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:03,840
It's over.

924
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:06,800
What if it ain't?

925
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:09,360
What if you have your dance
in Bayson?

926
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:12,120
No. The whole point was
to do something here in Bomont.

927
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:14,400
Bayson's, what,
thirty miles away?

928
01:18:16,200 --> 01:18:19,080
Not where it runs up
to these tracks it ain't.

929
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:25,040
I figure if the Bomont fire trucks
can't cross these tracks...

930
01:18:25,120 --> 01:18:27,000
neither can the long arm
of the law.

931
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:29,120
What about the long arm
of Reverend Moore?

932
01:18:29,200 --> 01:18:31,640
Remember he said if you could find
a way to convince him...

933
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:33,880
it wouldn't be a spiritual
corruption, he'd think about it.

934
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:36,880
- So?
- Make him think about it.

935
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:45,600
"And I beheld and heard
an angel flying...

936
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:48,880
through the midst of heaven
saying with a loud voice:

937
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:52,240
'Woe, woe, woe...

938
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:54,880
to the inhabiters of the earth. '

939
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:59,960
And I saw a star fall
from heaven unto the earth...

940
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:03,760
and the angel
was given the key...

941
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:06,320
to the bottomless pit.

942
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:10,640
And he opened
the bottomless pit...

943
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:15,960
and there arose a smoke out of
the pit as smoke of a great furnace.

944
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:20,840
And the sun and air were darkened
by reason of the smoke of the pit. "

945
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,160
Yes?

946
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:27,680
I used to get such a kick
watching you work up your sermons.

947
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:34,000
- And now?
- It's different.

948
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:39,480
I see the stage. I see costumes.
It's show business, isn't it?

949
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:43,200
Well...

950
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:49,360
it's the only way I know
to reach people's emotions.

951
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:55,760
I haven't heard from you
for a while.

952
01:19:57,880 --> 01:19:59,840
When was it? Thursday?

953
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:03,040
I was angry, you were angry.

954
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,520
- I was not.
- Yes, you were.

955
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:12,720
If you weren't, you would've
asked me what was wrong. You knew.

956
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:16,720
Ariel, I cannot let
this dance happen.

957
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:18,880
Ren MacCormack made
a lot of people stop and think.

958
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:21,600
I object to that kind of music,
and I think you know why.

959
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:24,280
- Because people fornicate to it.
- I never said that.

960
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:27,160
- You told the church board that.
- That was not meant for your ears!

961
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:29,720
When do my ears get old enough?
When do you stop protecting me?

962
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:31,120
I'm no saint!

963
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:33,400
It is my duty to look after
the spiritual growth of you...

964
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:35,600
I'm not even a virgin.

965
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:40,440
- Don't talk like that in here!
- Why not?

966
01:20:40,520 --> 01:20:44,800
Isn't this where I confess my sins
to my preacher? In church!

967
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:48,680
I ask to be forgiven. Am I?
Oh, forgive me, deliver me!

968
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:51,640
Don't do that in here. You
know better where to draw the line!

969
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:54,040
Thank heavens you're here.
People are calling.

970
01:20:54,120 --> 01:20:56,560
They're over at the library.

971
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:03,520
Roger! Eleanor!
What are you doing?

972
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,440
We decided these books...

973
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:09,120
Who's we? Whose authority
are you acting on?

974
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:11,280
Hold it everybody!
Listen to me!

975
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:16,440
When did you all decide
to sit in judgment?

976
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:23,200
Who elected you to be the saviors
of everybody's souls in Bomont?

977
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:26,440
We have a perfect right to determine
what our children...

978
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:32,800
When you've burned all of these,
what are you gonna do then?

979
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:37,080
Chris, take these out of here.

980
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:42,880
Satan is not in these books.

981
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:45,400
He's in here!

982
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:48,200
He's in your hearts.

983
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:50,800
Go on home, all of you.

984
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:53,040
Go and sit in judgment
on yourselves.

985
01:21:54,880 --> 01:21:57,600
And, Roger, go home.

986
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,200
Eleanor, come on.

987
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:04,120
Go home now, both of you.

988
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:42,840
Sometimes things
don't make any sense.

989
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:47,160
If you could explain to me my father
maybe I could explain your son.

990
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,840
But it doesn't make any sense.

991
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:57,240
Look, I gotta go.

992
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:02,720
Listen, I know you're gonna do
what you gotta do...

993
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:06,480
but thanks for listening.

994
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:14,960
Thank you for...

995
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:20,640
Well, thank you.

996
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:38,080
That was your friend Ren.

997
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:41,760
He came here to ask me if he could
take you to a senior prom.

998
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:48,960
I'm running out of answers.

999
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:52,800
I know how hard it is for you.

1000
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:57,440
I'm know I'm not making it easier.

1001
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:07,240
I just don't know that I believe
in everything you believe in...

1002
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:12,520
but I believe in you.

1003
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:41,280
I'm standing up here
before you today...

1004
01:24:43,800 --> 01:24:45,960
with a very troubled heart.

1005
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:51,080
You see, my friends...

1006
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:52,120
You see, my friends...

1007
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:56,880
I've always insisted on...

1008
01:24:56,920 --> 01:25:00,400
taking responsibility
for your lives.

1009
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:04,680
But, I'm really...

1010
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:08,880
like a first-time parent...

1011
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:12,600
who makes mistakes...

1012
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:15,880
and tries to learn from them.

1013
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:21,200
And like that parent...

1014
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:28,040
I find myself at that moment
when I have to decide.

1015
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:31,360
Do I hold on...

1016
01:25:33,240 --> 01:25:37,360
or do I trust you
to yourselves?

1017
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:42,680
Let go and hope
that you've understood...

1018
01:25:42,760 --> 01:25:46,320
at least some of my lessons.

1019
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:54,360
If we don't start trusting
our children...

1020
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:59,160
how will they
ever become trustworthy?

1021
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:04,680
I'm told that the senior class
at the high school...

1022
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:07,640
has got use of
the warehouse in Bayson...

1023
01:26:07,720 --> 01:26:12,240
for the purpose of
putting on a senior dance.

1024
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,000
Please...

1025
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:21,160
join me to pray
to the Lord...

1026
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:23,120
to guide them
in their endeavors.

1027
01:27:57,480 --> 01:27:58,640
Lights!

1028
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:22,240
- You look very nice.
- Oh, no.

1029
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:24,960
Yes, you do.
Yes, you look very nice.

1030
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:26,880
Yes, you do.
You look wonderful.

1031
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:29,080
- You think?
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

1032
01:28:34,360 --> 01:28:37,520
You can't very well go to a prom
without a corsage.

1033
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:42,160
Oh, Mom.

1034
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:44,160
This is gorgeous!

1035
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:51,240
- Where do you think I should...
- Here's a wrist thing.

1036
01:28:51,320 --> 01:28:53,400
Oh, Mom, you really
didn't have to.

1037
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:54,840
I didn't.

1038
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:02,200
Don't go on to him about it
because he'll only deny it.

1039
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:17,560
I was gonna come up and get...
I was...

1040
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:21,200
gonna come up and get you.

1041
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:25,160
- What's the matter?
- You're beautiful.

1042
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:29,960
What?

1043
01:29:37,720 --> 01:29:42,040
I mean it.
You are beautiful.

1044
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:49,520
Come on.

1045
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:01,400
Thank you.

1046
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:09,560
- Let's take a closer look.
- No. She'll think I'm checking up.

1047
01:32:09,640 --> 01:32:12,080
No. She won't even know
we're here. Come on.

1048
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:19,960
You're the last folks I expected
to see around here tonight.

1049
01:32:20,040 --> 01:32:22,680
- Good evening, Andy.
- Hi, Andy.

1050
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:24,800
Reverend, you done
a good thing here.

1051
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:27,720
I'm still not sure
it was the right thing.

1052
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:29,160
Comes close.

1053
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:47,800
Shaw?

1054
01:32:58,120 --> 01:32:59,640
What is it?

1055
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:06,360
It's just the two of us again.

1056
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,360
- Shaw?
- What?

1057
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:30,160
We're almost dancing.

1058
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:41,400
- Hi, Rusty.
- Hi.

1059
01:33:51,240 --> 01:33:52,880
Hello, Willard.

1060
01:33:54,040 --> 01:33:55,920
You promised you won't fight.

1061
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:57,760
Don't you look sweet.

1062
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:04,840
- What do you want?
- I've got business with MacCormack.

1063
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:07,400
Cool it, all right.
No fights tonight, okay?

1064
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:10,560
Hey, no fights, fellas.

1065
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:13,080
Sure, Willard.

1066
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:16,760
All right.

1067
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:21,640
Cute.
No fights, Willard.

1068
01:34:21,720 --> 01:34:26,160
Damn, man! I told you.
I promised Rusty no fights tonight.

1069
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:29,800
Let me go, goddamn it!

1070
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:33,560
- Oh, Willard!
- What do you want me to do, Rusty?

1071
01:34:33,640 --> 01:34:36,920
Kill the son of a bitch!
Help, somebody!

1072
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:44,240
- Chuck!
- Hey, it's Mr. Dance Fever.

1073
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:46,920
You're a goddamn hero
when it's five to one.

1074
01:34:48,800 --> 01:34:51,320
Ren, get up!
Beat the shit out of him!

1075
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:03,840
Bastard!

1076
01:35:08,120 --> 01:35:09,840
You're gonna dance now.

1077
01:35:22,080 --> 01:35:23,480
All right!

1078
01:35:28,280 --> 01:35:30,320
- Hey, handsome.
- Great dance, man.

1079
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:32,480
Fighter heroes!

1080
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:35,440
I thought you guys were
actually gonna fight or something.

1081
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:36,920
You're great.

1082
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:40,760
Hey, what's this I see?
I thought this was a party.

1083
01:35:40,840 --> 01:35:42,400
Let's dance!

1084
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:04,960
Just watch, all right?
