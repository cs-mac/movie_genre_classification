00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:08,711
(Episode 19)

2
00:00:08,831 --> 00:00:11,001
I'm Shim Jae Bok. I called earlier.

3
00:00:13,231 --> 00:00:16,701
As I told you, Lee Eun Hee is doing well.

4
00:00:17,331 --> 00:00:19,901
Still, I'd like to see her.

5
00:00:20,301 --> 00:00:21,701
Visiting hours are over.

6
00:00:21,802 --> 00:00:24,702
Let me see her. Please.

7
00:00:34,362 --> 00:00:37,632
See? She's fine.

8
00:00:45,532 --> 00:00:46,662
Eun Hee.

9
00:00:47,902 --> 00:00:50,632
Eun Hee. It's me, Jae Bok.

10
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:52,902
Eun Hee.

11
00:00:56,232 --> 00:00:59,432
That's Hae Wook's doll.

12
00:01:01,303 --> 00:01:02,663
Did she take it?

13
00:01:05,403 --> 00:01:08,103
Eun Hee. Eun Hee!

14
00:01:12,433 --> 00:01:13,733
I knew it.

15
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:17,862
She isn't Lee Eun Hee. Where is she?

16
00:01:17,863 --> 00:01:20,163
When did you switch her?

17
00:01:30,803 --> 00:01:31,803
Guys.

18
00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:35,803
Why are you here?

19
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,100
Eun Hee.

20
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,630
Get your hands off them.

21
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,530
Get your hands off. Jin Wook! Hae Wook!

22
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,806
No. No!

23
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,760
No. Don't go.

24
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,000
No.

25
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,460
Hae Wook. No.

26
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,699
Mommy. Are you dreaming?

27
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,160
- Mommy.
- No!

28
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:27,830
Hae Wook.

29
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:33,130
Jin Wook.

30
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,530
Darn it. You're so loud.

31
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:38,760
What is it?

32
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,330
Jin Wook.

33
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,360
- Jin Wook. Come here.
- Mommy.

34
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,830
Were you dreaming?

35
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,200
Was it a bad dream?

36
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:54,530
Yes, I guess so.

37
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,130
You're sweating.

38
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,330
You must be growing.

39
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,030
You said a scary dream
means you're growing.

40
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,800
I guess.

41
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,500
I guess...

42
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,330
I'm getting tall.

43
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,829
Why would an adult get taller?

44
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:15,929
It's possible.

45
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,029
- They don't.
- They do.

46
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,030
She's already all grown up.

47
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,300
Come here, guys. Let me hold you.

48
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,100
Why are you being corny this morning?

49
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,200
Mommy.

50
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,900
Jung Hee, wear this one.

51
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,700
How could you do this to me?

52
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,530
Let go!

53
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,530
Let go, you jerks! Let go!

54
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,860
Jung Hee.

55
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,260
You...

56
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,630
How did you get out?

57
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,260
- What are you saying?
- What are you saying?

58
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,100
Jung Hee.

59
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:20,760
Mom.

60
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:27,100
Gosh, your face is so pale.

61
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,529
What are you doing here so early?

62
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,300
What? I was worried about you.

63
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,200
Eun Kyung is at the
hospital, so you're alone.

64
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,560
You didn't have breakfast, right?
I'll make it quickly.

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,170
It's okay. I have to go to work.
I better go.

66
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,000
Hey.

67
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,460
Are you sure Eun Kyung is at a hospital?

68
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,700
Yes, I went and checked.

69
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,260
My poor baby.

70
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,670
Now...

71
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:17,030
will Jung Hee and I live here alone?

72
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,999
Mr. Kim, where are you?

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,730
I quit.

74
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,400
Mr. Kim? Hello? Hello?

75
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,230
What are you doing?

76
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,730
What are you doing?

77
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,560
Yes, ma'am. It's all cleared.

78
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,629
Mr. Oh, what happened here?

79
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,130
Your department has been terminated.

80
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,930
Mr. Koo. You're fired as of today.

81
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
What?

82
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,330
What is this?

83
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:18,259
There were so many projects
I was in charge of.

84
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,299
How can you do this?

85
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,820
What are you doing? You're being rude.

86
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,960
Mr. Koo, you're nothing now.

87
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,960
Mr. Oh. Mr. Oh!

88
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:37,730
(Chief Director Koo Jung Hee)

89
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,530
You're sure?

90
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:43,700
Is Lee Eun Hee in the hospital?

91
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:50,300
Yes. Thank you.

92
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,130
If something happens,

93
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:57,100
please give me a call.
I'll really appreciate it.

94
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,560
Is she doing well?

95
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,099
- Yes.
- She should be.

96
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,459
She needs treatment and get well...

97
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,860
in order to get proper questioning done.

98
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,760
Whenever I call,

99
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,659
the person in charge always says the same.

100
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,129
Jae Bok, don't worry too much.

101
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,930
I looked into it, and
she's getting treatment.

102
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,660
Do you think it's true?

103
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,660
Is she really getting better?

104
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,730
For some reason, I don't
think she'll be there.

105
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,230
I keep dreaming of it.

106
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:39,429
You've become really sensitive.

107
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,200
You need to take it easy.

108
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,460
Let's go.

109
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,460
- Where?
- To see Eun Hee.

110
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,999
I feel like you'll get sick
at this rate. Come on.

111
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,560
I went there last time,

112
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,099
and she refused to meet.

113
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,229
Let's go anyway. Come on.

114
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:58,659
Yes. Go in there somehow,
and check with your eyes.

115
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,029
I feel bad just looking at you.

116
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,999
- Go. Hurry.
- Okay. Let's go.

117
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,260
- Mom. Mom!
- Yes?

118
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,760
What's going on?

119
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,829
What is all this?

120
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,930
Our stuff.

121
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,399
That man told us to leave.

122
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,530
Who are you?

123
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,960
Bryan is on the line.

124
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,430
You punk. What do you think you're doing?

125
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:27,730
It's just as you see it.

126
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,330
Vacant the house.

127
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,000
My sister is gone.

128
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,459
You have no right to live there.

129
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,600
How can you kick someone out so suddenly?

130
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,729
I was engaged to your sister.

131
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,100
Engaged?

132
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,800
You were disgusted by her.
You called her crazy.

133
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:50,930
Isn't it funny that you're
bringing that up now?

134
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,300
Fine, we'll leave.

135
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,930
I'll leave.

136
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,729
- Mom, let's go.
- Where to?

137
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,000
To your house.

138
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,030
Jung Hee.

139
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:14,630
What? So we don't have anywhere to live?

140
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:19,029
No. Your brother Jung Bae
wanted to open a business,

141
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:22,769
so he took my lease deposit and ran away.

142
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,270
Why did you give him all of that?

143
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,330
Jung Bae, that jerk.

144
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,770
Mom, what about the place...

145
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,230
Eun Hee bought for you?

146
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,530
He took it all.

147
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:39,430
If you give him all of
that, where do we live?

148
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,430
Ms. Lee Eun Hee is coming.

149
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,830
I heard you came to visit me last time,

150
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:12,730
but I couldn't see you.

151
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,300
I wasn't ready to meet you then.

152
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,460
I'm sorry.

153
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,860
Are you ready now?

154
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,660
I feel a bit lighter.

155
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,460
Have you been well?

156
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,130
You don't look so good.

157
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,660
Eun Hee, you look good.

158
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,730
Yes. I'm doing well.

159
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:47,330
I'm taking my pills and getting treatment.

160
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:53,660
You're doing bad because of me, aren't you?

161
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,930
Actually,

162
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,730
I've been anxious.

163
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,760
People told me that you were here,

164
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,560
but I couldn't believe it.

165
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,160
That's why I came.

166
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,400
Of course.

167
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,930
I've wronged you so many times.

168
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:19,030
I can't even apologize to you.

169
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:20,860
Still,

170
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,660
I'm really sorry.

171
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:32,900
Are you really repenting?

172
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,740
Are you sure this isn't a show?

173
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:40,430
I regret what happened...

174
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,260
with Na Mi as well.

175
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,730
You must have been in sorrow.

176
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,100
I'm sorry.

177
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,700
After coming here, I
thought about what I did.

178
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:07,000
I think I made a lot of people get hurt.

179
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,900
Why did I do such a thing?
I really regret it.

180
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:14,960
Right.

181
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,560
It was because of your mental illness,

182
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,430
but it can't give you a pardon.

183
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,960
You made all of us suffer.

184
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,230
I'm sorry.

185
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,230
I have a question to ask you.

186
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,600
Please answer me in all honesty.

187
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,460
What happened with Na Mi...

188
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,330
Was it really not your doing?

189
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,000
What are you doing?

190
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,999
Do not stimulate the patient.

191
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,799
What are you talking about? What did we do?

192
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,730
The visit is over.

193
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,930
Please leave.

194
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,560
Ms. Lee.

195
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm okay.

196
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,699
They came from far away. I
don't mind talking longer.

197
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,160
It's time for your music therapy.

198
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,030
Okay.

199
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,730
Jae Bok, don't be nervous.

200
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,430
I'm no longer...

201
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,160
the Eun Hee you know.

202
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,000
You're comforting me?

203
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,960
How funny.

204
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,600
Is it because the treatment is going well?

205
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,400
We'll come back another time.

206
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,730
We'll talk later.

207
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:03,529
Even when somewhere pleasant.

208
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:07,800
Calls for me.

209
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,559
The only place for rest is the small house.

210
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,100
Eun Hee didn't change at all.

211
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,030
She's only acting.

212
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:23,530
If she hasn't changed,
it'll show on the tests.

213
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,960
Are you all right?

214
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:35,560
I'm fine. I have to be...

215
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,329
if I want to face Eun Hee.

216
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:43,729
My love, my house.

217
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:47,630
(Ms. Perfect)

218
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,730
Gosh, this is perfect for Won Jae.

219
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,360
Let's see.

220
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,460
All right.

221
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,400
Why is it so expensive? Are they crazy?

222
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,500
I'll pay.

223
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,476
I can buy everything.

224
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,630
You don't have to feel pressured.

225
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,130
No.

226
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,630
I'm a man.

227
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:40,430
I'll buy you even if I have
to sell my golden tooth.

228
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,600
Sam Kyu.

229
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:53,730
You're buying me dinner at a
romantic place like here?

230
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,400
I just want to crumble.

231
00:15:58,730 --> 00:15:59,730
Won Jae.

232
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,930
Are we having dinner here?

233
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,530
Are you buying?

234
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,130
What's this? Sam Kyu?

235
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:14,236
Hey, are you setting the two of us up?

236
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:17,130
Yes. Have a great time.

237
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,930
- I'll get going.
- Hey, Won Jae.

238
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,130
What do you think you're doing?

239
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,999
If you hand him over like
you're volunteering,

240
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,830
did you think I'll thank you and take him?

241
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,630
Forget it. You keep him all you want.

242
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:34,399
What are you doing? I thought
you wanted him again.

243
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,199
You should date him.
Friendship comes first to me.

244
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,199
- Go.
- No. Do you think I have no pride?

245
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,499
- I have a lot of men.
- I said I'm okay.

246
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,429
- You should go in.
- Gosh, are you serious?

247
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,460
- You go in.
- My goodness.

248
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,030
Gosh.

249
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,530
Gosh.

250
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:55,930
Won Jae. Won Jae.

251
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,730
Ouch. Wait. Wait.

252
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,860
Do you still get nightmares?

253
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,630
Eun Hee either chases me...

254
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:15,300
or my kids disappear.

255
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:20,130
I can't sleep deeply, so I'm always tired.

256
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,970
Come here.

257
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,000
- Sit down.
- Why?

258
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,530
- What is it?
- Sleep here for 10 minutes.

259
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:32,099
I'll sleep at home.

260
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,300
You just said you can't sleep at home.

261
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,660
Just sleep for 10 minutes.

262
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,830
It'll feel refreshing if you
sleep well for 10 minutes.

263
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,400
I'll count 10 minutes from now, okay?

264
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,660
Here, okay. Sleep now.

265
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,130
Sleep.

266
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,300
All right. Then just 10 minutes.

267
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,100
How can you sleep like that?

268
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,360
You can't sleep like that.
No. Go like this.

269
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,700
Come here.

270
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,650
Now you're sleepy, right?
This is what you should do.

271
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,230
You know,

272
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,000
my parents separated early...

273
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,030
so I lived alone since I
was in middle school.

274
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,099
I thought there wasn't much to life.

275
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,330
I went around with my nose up high.

276
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,730
But it's scary sleeping alone
in a basement apartment.

277
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,900
I used to get paralyzing nightmares.

278
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,830
These days, you're going through...

279
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:44,030
such hard times. It feels...

280
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,560
It really feels bad to hear about it.

281
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,006
I wish I could go into your dreams...

282
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,530
and fight in it for you.
Why aren't you sleeping?

283
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:56,200
How can I sleep when
you're talking so much?

284
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,530
Okay, sleep. Sleep. I'm sorry.

285
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,000
Dad...

286
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,530
Dad...

287
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:44,160
Dad.

288
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:55,130
I wonder if Jung Hee is okay.

289
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,900
(Jung Hee)

290
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,300
(Jae Bok)

291
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,660
(Jae Bok)

292
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,130
(Jae Bok)

293
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:28,330
(Jae Bok)

294
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,360
Try drawing your face as well.

295
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,500
Eun Hee.

296
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:43,230
- A tree and a house?
- A house.

297
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:52,830
That's right.

298
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:20,900
(One month later)

299
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,830
Mister, watch it!

300
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,030
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

301
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,730
- Did you watch it yesterday?
- Yes, I did.

302
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,329
- You look kind of like him.
- Totally.

303
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:04,360
- Stop it.
- Let's go to the internet cafe.

304
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,830
Okay. Internet cafe.

305
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,330
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

306
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,400
Jin Wook. Jin Wook...

307
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,929
- Noodles.
- Black.

308
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:31,000
Bee.

309
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:33,000
- Bee?
- No, no. Bean.

310
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,260
Jin Wook.

311
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,960
In Ho.

312
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,259
- Dad.
- Hello.

313
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,829
Your dad's car is awesome.

314
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,500
Isn't it amazing?

315
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,030
They're so childish.

316
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,830
That's his dad's car, not his.

317
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,830
- Hey, isn't that your dad?
- What?

318
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:58,860
What? Dad!

319
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,400
Dad! Dad!

320
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,429
- Maybe it's not.
- I'm sure it was.

321
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,860
No way. My dad isn't that grungy.

322
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:13,659
He dresses super well.

323
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,560
Good for you. You have a dad.

324
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,359
Sorry. I'm sorry.

325
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,130
It's okay. Let's go.

326
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,900
Okay.

327
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,300
I'm going to get you.

328
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,200
What's wrong with you?

329
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,030
Jin Wook.

330
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,000
I'm sorry.

331
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,499
Our housekeeper does all
the grocery shopping.

332
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,700
Still. I wanted to come with you.

333
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,830
My cute Che Ri. So cute.

334
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,899
You found your way.

335
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,330
Che Ri.

336
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,700
This is our shopping list.

337
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,430
Thank you.

338
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,259
Don't you worry, Little Miss.

339
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:17,660
I'll get your groceries without mistake.

340
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:21,229
I'll go now, Mom. I have my cello lesson.

341
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:23,560
Che Ri. What are you...

342
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:27,659
Mom. They say love is about timing.

343
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,800
Don't miss it.

344
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,700
Che Ri!

345
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,400
Che Ri, see you later.

346
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,100
Won Jae, I'll push the cart.

347
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,430
(Motel)

348
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:20,860
Jae Bok.

349
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,600
Why are you here?

350
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,830
Gosh. It's a long story.

351
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,000
Come in.

352
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,200
Sit down.

353
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,600
I heard Jung Hee quit the company.

354
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,160
He didn't quit. He was fired.

355
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:58,460
Since Eun Kyung or Eun Hee,
what's her name is gone,

356
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,700
we've been thrown into the dumpster.

357
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,830
We were kicked out of that nice house too.

358
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,730
You've been here since back then?

359
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,360
Where is Jung Hee working?

360
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,600
Just... Here and there.

361
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,830
He's a good worker, so
he'll get a job soon.

362
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,130
But anyway...

363
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:35,160
I've been short on cash lately.

364
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:39,100
Do you have any money you can lend me?

365
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,560
Is that why you called?

366
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,260
Once Jung Hee gets a nice job,

367
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,360
I'll pay you right back.

368
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,030
This is all the cash I have.

369
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,460
- Jae Bok.
- Jung Hee.

370
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,100
You got out early today.

371
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:20,660
Why did she have to call you?

372
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,000
How are the kids?

373
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,360
Hae Wook must've grown a lot, right?

374
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,960
Do you want to see them?

375
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,000
Should we have dinner together?

376
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:37,230
You didn't let me see them before.

377
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,429
Do you feel sorry for me?

378
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:42,630
That was because of Eun Hee.

379
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,030
Because she was too dangerous for the kids.

380
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:50,030
The kids miss you too.

381
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,360
When are you free?

382
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,830
Forget it.

383
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:56,300
How can I see them like this?

384
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,959
I'll go visit once I'm settled.

385
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,599
I heard you're doing well.

386
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,000
There's a rumor that your firm will expand.

387
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,630
Yes. So I've been very busy lately.

388
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,800
That's great.

389
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,860
You'll fulfill your dreams. I'm sure of it.

390
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,500
You...

391
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,760
resented me a lot, didn't you?

392
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:28,030
You lost everything because...

393
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:30,330
I had Eun Hee locked up.

394
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:35,500
To be honest, I did at first.

395
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,260
But none of it was mine anyway.

396
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,130
I must've lost my mind for a while.
What an idiot.

397
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:48,860
Jae Bok. I'm sorry.

398
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,100
You don't have to forgive me.

399
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,630
I'm sorry to you and to the kids.

400
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:58,000
I just...

401
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,800
wanted to do well.

402
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,160
I wanted to be a cool dad.

403
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,960
Go back.

404
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:12,030
I'll walk you a little farther.

405
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,760
This is good enough. Go back.

406
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,000
Rest up. Go see a doctor
if your back hurts a lot.

407
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,130
I will.

408
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:30,300
- Bye.
- Bye.

409
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:40,230
How did this happen to us?

410
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,100
How?

411
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,530
Hello?

412
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,099
Where are you?

413
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,700
I'm on my way to the office. Why?

414
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:02,400
Eun Hee was discharged from the hospital.

415
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
What?

416
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:08,929
When?

417
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:11,660
Just now. I had been checking.

418
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:18,460
Are you okay?

419
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:21,800
Yes, I'm okay.

420
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,260
Jae Bok. What's wrong?

421
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:30,000
Eun Hee's been discharged.

422
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,660
What will you do?

423
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,930
Will you see her again?

424
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:41,360
No. Just thinking about her scares me.

425
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,500
Are you okay?

426
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,400
You have to be careful.

427
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,930
She may get back at you.

428
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,830
I'm fine.

429
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:54,200
I'm not afraid of anything.

430
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:56,260
Be careful.

431
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,030
The kids too.

432
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:25,130
I'm home, Mom.

433
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,430
I did it.

434
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:36,230
She doesn't know anything.

435
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,499
Please calm down.

436
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,860
How can I be calm? That
scary psycho is back.

437
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,460
Eun Hee changed a lot. You saw last time.

438
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:43,760
Do you believe that? Be honest.

439
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,630
Do you believe that?

440
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,000
You're saying that to calm me down.

441
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,300
I need to see Eun Hee's brother.

442
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,100
We need to send her back to the hospital.

443
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:07,000
That's absurd.

444
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,430
Even if his daughter is precious,

445
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:12,099
how could he take her out of the hospital?

446
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,636
The hospital said her results were good...

447
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,536
and that she was safe to be discharged.

448
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:19,100
You punk. How could she
have been cured already?

449
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,330
She was in there for a month.

450
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,730
I'll check on her.

451
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,800
- Rest assured.
- No.

452
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,430
I can't rest assured as
long as she's out there.

453
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:34,260
You take responsibility and make sure...

454
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,700
to keep a close eye on her.

455
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:38,259
Okay. I will.

456
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:42,660
This is huge. A scary person
is free to roam around.

457
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,730
It's a big problem.

458
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,300
Do you remember this? I used
to make this for you...

459
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,530
when we were young.

460
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,600
I suddenly remembered this in the hospital.

461
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:11,100
And that I hadn't made
it for you in a while.

462
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,330
After taking the beating from Mom for me,

463
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,730
you made this for me...

464
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,330
although you were in pain...

465
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:23,830
to tell me to smile.

466
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,560
Bryan.

467
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,260
Don't worry too much.

468
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,530
I'm really completely cured now.

469
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,160
Really?

470
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:37,030
Are you really all better?

471
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,630
I'm really sorry...

472
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,000
for always making you worry.

473
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,000
Bryan.

474
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:52,760
I love you more than anyone.

475
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,960
Go visit Mom.

476
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,400
She misses you a lot.

477
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,370
I should.

478
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,630
I should make up with her.

479
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,960
I'll forgive her now.

480
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:14,130
I think that's the only way to find peace.

481
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:17,160
Eun Hee.

482
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:44,730
I won't go back there again.

483
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:49,730
Will you live like this,

484
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:52,600
- looking like this?
- What's wrong with this?

485
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,600
I'm happy right now because
my heart is at peace.

486
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,900
It may be tiring,

487
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:01,430
but I'll rise again from here.

488
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:06,100
I know just how badly I annoyed you.

489
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:08,900
I know how hard I made it for you.

490
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:14,330
I repented a lot while
I was in the hospital.

491
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,700
I really regretted it.

492
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:20,760
I'm all better now.

493
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:24,369
I'm not the old Eun Hee.

494
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:26,260
There you go again.

495
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,600
You've said that all before.

496
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,330
I mean it.

497
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,030
I won't make it hard for you...

498
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:37,030
because of my obsessions.

499
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,370
I'll be a good wife.

500
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:45,430
Are you really completely better?

501
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,870
Then you start a new life too.

502
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:53,370
Forget me,

503
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:56,400
and live a happy, good life.

504
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,800
Please.

505
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:01,700
How could I be happy...

506
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,660
without you there?

507
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,130
Goodbye.

508
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,529
- What?
- She's back?

509
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:24,700
The kids will hear.

510
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:27,260
Is she back home then?

511
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,960
Probably.

512
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,000
I wonder if Jung Hee is okay.

513
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:35,506
I'm more worried about you.

514
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:37,730
You look terrible.

515
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,660
Hey. You have us. Don't worry.

516
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,000
Should I...

517
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,730
just immigrate?

518
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,100
What?

519
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:51,430
I'm too worried to live here with Eun Hee.

520
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,500
It I were alone, I'd make it work somehow,

521
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,530
but for Jin Wook and Hae Wook's sake...

522
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:09,760
Bong Goo said you seemed
nervous and insisted...

523
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,160
We'll stay here for a few days.

524
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:14,829
We'll guard the door, so you sleep.

525
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:17,430
You can't survive with no
sleep and so much fear.

526
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,330
You don't have to do this.

527
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,370
How can you live here?

528
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:24,429
We'll come at night just to sleep.

529
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:28,200
During that time, trust us and sleep well.

530
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,329
Will you be okay?

531
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:33,559
Of course. I've slept
outdoors for 30 years.

532
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,000
It'll be uncomfortable.

533
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,630
No, no.

534
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,160
Push me.

535
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,000
Push me.

536
00:39:05,330 --> 00:39:08,300
Hae Wook. Hae Wook!

537
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:16,500
Hae Wook. No! It's dangerous!

538
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,960
Hae Wook!

539
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,369
Hae Wook!

540
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:25,030
Hae Wook!

541
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,630
Hae Wook!

542
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,230
Hae Wook.

543
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,300
Hae Wook!

544
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,900
Hae Wook.

545
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,899
Hae Wook!

546
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:40,159
Hae Wook! No!

547
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,400
No! Hae Wook!

548
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,229
Hae Wook!

549
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:48,460
- No!
- Mom.

550
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,369
- Hae Wook!
- What's wrong?

551
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:52,529
- Hae Wook!
- What's wrong?

552
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:54,229
Hae Wook!

553
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:56,430
- It's okay.
- Hae Wook!

554
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,260
- Hae Wook!
- Jae Bok!

555
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,159
No!

556
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,200
- Jae Bok.
- Mommy.

557
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,660
It's okay.

558
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:06,460
It was just a dream.

559
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:08,530
Jae Bok.

560
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,700
- Oh my gosh.
- Are you okay?

561
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,230
Oh, no.

562
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,560
- Mommy.
- It's okay. It's just a dream.

563
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,900
- Mom.
- A dream.

564
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,346
- Calm down.
- Are you okay?

565
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:22,370
Mommy.

566
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,630
Are you okay?

567
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:29,630
Jae Bok.

568
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:36,200
Come here.

569
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,400
- Mommy's okay.
- Mom.

570
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,459
Oh my gosh. What should we do?

571
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,500
Mom.

572
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,800
It's okay.

573
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:02,760
Jae Bok. Are you okay now?

574
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:04,560
Yes.

575
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:07,660
Sorry for waking you.

576
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,370
What do you mean?

577
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:13,430
We're just sad that we
can't share your burden.

578
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:19,530
Eun Hee being all calm and quiet...

579
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,400
scares me more.

580
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:26,399
This means she got worse, right?

581
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,260
Yes. It's better for her
to show her true self.

582
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:32,800
It'd only get worse since
she's suppressing it.

583
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,160
Just watch over Jung Hee.

584
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,560
Who knows what she'll do?

585
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,530
I plan to.

586
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:45,200
Even if he refuses, I'll keep watching.

587
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,600
I have to. He's the kids' dad.

588
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,560
What? What did you just say?

589
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,000
How dare you?

590
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,200
Do you know who I was just
until a few days ago?

591
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,330
I was the madam of a wealthy family.

592
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,460
You just have to act so cool, don't you?

593
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,460
You can't even do the work right.

594
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,430
Why this woman...

595
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:10,176
- Oh my gosh.
- Just hit me. Hit me.

596
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,629
- Hit me.
- Why you...

597
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,700
Mother.

598
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:19,330
You...

599
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:23,930
Mother.

600
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:26,830
I'm really cured now.

601
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,800
I'll be good to you now.

602
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:32,330
Get away.

603
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,930
Mother. You used to be so refined.

604
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:42,800
What's wrong with you? I have to work. Go.

605
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,300
- Mother. I'll do it.
- Well...

606
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:51,560
I can't leave when you're
working hard like this.

607
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,130
You don't have to go home with me.

608
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:57,230
Just let me help you a little.

609
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,929
Mom. Did you really go back there?

610
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:11,930
Yes.

611
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:14,999
Turns out Eun Kyung...

612
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,900
I mean, Eun Hee is all better.

613
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:22,500
She was crying so much while apologizing.

614
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:26,760
A person needs to know how to forgive.

615
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,260
Get out of there! Now!

616
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,876
You know she's dangerous!

617
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:33,870
No! Don't come if you don't want to.

618
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,529
I'm going to live here.

619
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:36,906
Where's Eun Hee?

620
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:39,700
I don't know. I think she went out.

621
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,200
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

622
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,660
- Wipe this here.
- Yes, ma'am.

623
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:49,960
Yes. I'll prepare the
documents and send them over.

624
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:51,330
Okay.

625
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,400
Jae Bok.

626
00:43:57,530 --> 00:43:58,560
You...

627
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:01,460
Why are you here?

628
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:04,500
Why are you here?

629
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:06,630
Jae Bok...

630
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,830
What's your deal?

631
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,960
This is where you were?

632
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:20,360
I thought...

633
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,000
it would be only right
for me to come first.

634
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:29,030
Last time,

635
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:33,029
you seemed so nervous because of me.

636
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:37,930
You must be roaming around
as you think you're well,

637
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:41,100
but you're not. I don't believe you.

638
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:45,560
I'm sorry.

639
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:48,930
You used to be so strong.

640
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:50,960
It's all my fault.

641
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,899
I feel so bad.

642
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:58,530
Eun Hee. Stop pretending
to be a nice person.

643
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,600
Are you really all better?

644
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,160
I'm sure you wouldn't believe it,

645
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:08,730
- but I...
- Then let the police investigate you.

646
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:10,260
Na...

647
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,830
Na Mi's case...

648
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,900
was framed on your mom,

649
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:20,130
but you have several cases
to answer questions about.

650
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:26,476
Here are the cases the police
will investigate on you.

651
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,530
Take a look.

652
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:32,700
I'll go for investigation.

653
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:35,930
If I must be punished,

654
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,530
I'll accept that as well.

655
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,960
I apologize once again.

656
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:50,430
Jae Bok. I won't hurt Jin Wook...

657
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,960
and Hae Wook.

658
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,430
I'm sorry for suddenly popping in.

659
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,200
Bye.

660
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:09,960
Wait.

661
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:12,430
You haven't changed.

662
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:15,000
I know.

663
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:19,600
I'll keep a close eye on you.

664
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,700
Are you okay?

665
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:45,999
You can tell if you see her...

666
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,260
when she is alone.

667
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:14,230
She does look like she has changed.

668
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,430
No.

669
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:20,000
She hasn't changed. Eun Hee.

670
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:23,130
She's still a crazy woman.

671
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:26,230
This woman...

672
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,230
won't change.

673
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:31,800
I know.

674
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,860
She'll never change.

675
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:37,200
I know.

676
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,229
I...

677
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:41,430
Jae Bok.

678
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:57,260
Jae Bok.

679
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:02,360
She's been too nervous and not sleeping.

680
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:04,030
She finally fainted.

681
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:08,776
Everything is because of Eun Hee.

682
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,029
Jae Bok was always so strong before.

683
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:12,400
It's all my fault.

684
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:15,100
It's all my fault.

685
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,800
It's all my fault.

686
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:26,830
It's all my fault...

687
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:28,410
for Jae Bok to suffer like that.

688
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,560
I'm the only person...

689
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:46,200
who can correct this.

690
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:01,700
If I want to protect Jae Bok and the kids,

691
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:06,000
I need to step up. I must stop Eun Kyung.

692
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:10,030
Even if I become the sacrificial
lamb and disappear,

693
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:14,030
I must act like a real dad if I want...

694
00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:16,800
to protect my family.

695
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,200
Jung Hee.

696
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:36,900
Eun Kyung.

697
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:40,030
Are you moving back in?

698
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,330
You couldn't trust me.

699
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:52,360
I was worried about you.

700
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:56,130
Jung Hee.

701
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:02,360
I'll stay...

702
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:05,300
by your side.

703
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:07,960
Thank you, Jung Hee.

704
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:09,800
Thank you.

705
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:13,400
I love you.

706
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:17,600
I love you.

707
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:30,100
(SI Construction)

708
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:41,830
Mr. Koo! I made a huge mistake!

709
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:47,300
I only did as they told me to from above.

710
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:50,530
I'm sure you did.

711
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:54,130
You lead a difficult life too.

712
00:51:16,530 --> 00:51:18,430
(Chief Director Koo Jung Hee)

713
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:29,000
I won't spy on you anymore.

714
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:31,360
I got rid of them all.

715
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:34,030
I fired Mr. Ha too.

716
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,960
And I won't have you tailed.

717
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:38,560
I won't put a GPS tracker on you.

718
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,560
Whatever you do, I'll trust you.

719
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:46,930
Because I love you.

720
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:50,300
Thank you, Eun Kyung, for trusting me.

721
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:55,500
I'm going to cut all ties with Jae Bok now.

722
00:51:57,130 --> 00:51:58,900
I won't see the kids anymore either.

723
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:03,830
I'll live only for you, Eun Kyung.

724
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,100
Jung Hee.

725
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:11,930
Let the two of us...

726
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,560
be happy now.

727
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:16,960
Okay, Jung Hee.

728
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:21,730
Okay. Lets...

729
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:25,830
live happily ever after.

730
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:33,800
I love you.

731
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:48,700
It's June 15. I'm starting
a secret diary from today.

732
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:53,000
This is my confession diary as well as...

733
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:56,529
What is all of this?

734
00:53:56,530 --> 00:53:58,300
When will you ever learn how to keep house?

735
00:53:58,630 --> 00:53:59,860
It will become...

736
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:04,000
- my observation log on Eun Kyung.
- Yes, Mother.

737
00:54:09,030 --> 00:54:11,100
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.

738
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:15,230
Have a nice day at work.

739
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,929
Did you sleep well, Mother?

740
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:24,229
Why is my room so dry? My throat's all dry.

741
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:25,959
Get me an air purifier.

742
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:29,630
- Mother.
- I can't tell if her mental illness...

743
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:31,330
is cured.

744
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:33,599
I'll go buy one right away. I'm sorry.

745
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,160
The most I can do for Jae Bok,

746
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,500
Jin Wook and Hae Wook...

747
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:41,260
is to keep monitoring Eun Kyung...

748
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:43,760
and stop her madness.

749
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:00,830
(Jae Bok)

750
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:05,936
Hello?

751
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:09,160
Jung Hee. Did you move
back into Eun Hee's house?

752
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:11,030
Are you insane?

753
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:17,830
Eun Hee improved a lot.

754
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,500
- She's not like before.
- You hope she's better.

755
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:24,030
She didn't get better.

756
00:55:24,630 --> 00:55:27,560
You're in danger. Move out right away.

757
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,176
Are you doing okay?

758
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:34,400
I'm not okay, but your doing this...

759
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:36,360
is driving me insane.

760
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:40,600
What if something happens
while living with Eun Kyung?

761
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,100
What about the kids?

762
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:46,100
Even if something happens,

763
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:49,660
- there's nothing I can do.
- What?

764
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:57,630
Jung Hee. Are you still unable...

765
00:55:58,330 --> 00:55:59,960
to forfeit your greed?

766
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:03,560
Is living in luxury that important?

767
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:06,100
Enough to live on edge with that woman?

768
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:10,930
Yes, I guess so.

769
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:17,930
Jae Bok.

770
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:20,400
Jung Hee.

771
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:23,130
How did this happen to you?

772
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:26,260
You won't listen to anything I say anymore.

773
00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:29,660
I think you've gone crazy too.

774
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:32,830
That's right.

775
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:37,230
I may have been crazy from a long time ago.

776
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,030
That's why I ended up here.

777
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:44,560
Jae Bok. Why did you come
here without telling me?

778
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,760
I heard you moved into Eun Hee's house.

779
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:52,600
Yes. I did.

780
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:55,530
You really are incredible.

781
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,030
Jung Hee.

782
00:56:59,830 --> 00:57:01,130
I can't...

783
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,500
do anything with you anymore.

784
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,500
Still...

785
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:12,030
You're still my friend.

786
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:18,730
Call me if anything happens.

787
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:20,860
Always be careful.

788
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,730
- Jae Bok.
- Bong Goo.

789
00:57:31,101 --> 00:57:33,701
Take good care of her.

790
00:57:34,601 --> 00:57:37,801
I know I'm shameless, but our kids too.

791
00:57:39,401 --> 00:57:41,801
You won't even call anymore?

792
00:57:42,601 --> 00:57:44,731
No. That's the plan.

793
00:57:45,531 --> 00:57:47,631
So don't contact me again.

794
00:57:53,631 --> 00:57:55,131
What's this?

795
00:57:57,101 --> 00:57:58,161
Jae Bok.

796
01:01:09,361 --> 01:01:13,601
They say Jung Hee has
been careless with work,

797
01:01:15,101 --> 01:01:16,831
and that he has no drive anymore.

798
01:01:17,231 --> 01:01:21,501
I'm worried he's thinking
of doing something drastic.

799
01:01:21,701 --> 01:01:23,101
Did he say anything?

800
01:01:25,863 --> 01:01:28,133
Even if something happens,

801
01:01:29,463 --> 01:01:30,633
there's nothing I can do.

802
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,463
Why do you think something happened?

803
01:02:23,303 --> 01:02:24,363
Call him.

804
01:02:28,833 --> 01:02:32,463
(Jae Bok)

805
01:02:53,933 --> 01:02:54,963
He isn't answering?

806
01:02:56,563 --> 01:02:58,263
He's such a pain.

807
01:02:59,033 --> 01:03:02,103
I'll ring the doorbell then. Okay?

808
01:03:02,603 --> 01:03:03,633
I'll ring the bell.

809
01:03:21,503 --> 01:03:24,503
(Jae Bok)
