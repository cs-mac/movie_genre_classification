00:02:53,097 --> 00:03:00,731
IDENTIFICATION OF A WOMAN

1
00:04:43,274 --> 00:04:46,141
Where the hell
did I put that thing?

2
00:05:05,529 --> 00:05:07,497
Keep calm.

3
00:05:16,841 --> 00:05:18,832
Goddamn her paranoia!

4
00:05:33,224 --> 00:05:35,749
<i>His wife was</i>
<i>a very fearful woman,</i>

5
00:05:36,293 --> 00:05:41,026
<i>When they divorced,</i>
<i>she took her fears with her,</i>

6
00:05:41,198 --> 00:05:43,166
<i>but the alarm system stayed,</i>

7
00:06:43,594 --> 00:06:45,619
All right, all right.

8
00:06:55,539 --> 00:06:56,836
I'm coming.

9
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:18,756
<i>Uncle Niccolo, don't forget,</i>
<i>You promised me a year ago,</i>

10
00:07:18,929 --> 00:07:20,396
Yeah, I know.

11
00:07:20,965 --> 00:07:22,398
I know.

12
00:07:23,167 --> 00:07:25,863
You're right, damn it.

13
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,118
- Everything okay?
- Yes. It was my fault.

14
00:07:49,293 --> 00:07:53,195
I'm sorry, Romolo.
- I even brought this. You never know.

15
00:07:53,364 --> 00:07:55,764
- Good thinking.
- Good night.

16
00:08:08,646 --> 00:08:10,238
The stamps...

17
00:08:17,855 --> 00:08:19,516
Again?

18
00:08:29,934 --> 00:08:32,835
- <i>Mr, Niccolo Farra?</i>
- Who's this?

19
00:08:33,003 --> 00:08:36,370
- <i>So you're back at last,</i>
- What do you mean, "at last"?

20
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,165
Hello!

21
00:08:38,342 --> 00:08:43,041
<i>I've been asked to tell you</i>
<i>something impo</i>rt<i>ant,,, for you,</i>

22
00:08:43,213 --> 00:08:44,976
You know what time it is?

23
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,946
<i>You weren't in earlier,</i>

24
00:08:47,685 --> 00:08:49,380
What's your name?

25
00:08:49,553 --> 00:08:51,544
<i>How about meeting somewhere?</i>

26
00:08:51,722 --> 00:08:54,520
If it's so important, tell me now.
Who is this?

27
00:08:54,692 --> 00:08:56,557
<i>Not over the phone,</i>

28
00:08:56,727 --> 00:09:00,720
<i>It's a delicate matter,</i>
<i>Better in person,</i>

29
00:09:01,298 --> 00:09:03,095
Who asked you to call?

30
00:09:03,267 --> 00:09:05,428
<i>I'll tell you when we meet,</i>

31
00:09:05,603 --> 00:09:07,332
Then give me your phone number.

32
00:09:07,504 --> 00:09:10,166
<i>I don't have one,</i>
<i>That's why we have to meet,</i>

33
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:13,310
<i>How's 10,:00 a, m, tomorrow</i>
<i>at Fassi's ice cream parlor?</i>

34
00:09:39,236 --> 00:09:40,703
<i>Who is it?</i>

35
00:09:47,311 --> 00:09:50,007
Why can't I stop
thinking about you?

36
00:10:19,176 --> 00:10:20,643
Hello.

37
00:10:30,387 --> 00:10:31,877
For some time

38
00:10:32,056 --> 00:10:34,889
you've been interested in a girl -
very pretty, I'm told.

39
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:37,050
I've never met her.

40
00:10:37,227 --> 00:10:38,489
Her name?

41
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:43,095
I'm sure we're thinking
of the same person.

42
00:10:43,734 --> 00:10:46,635
Anyway, it's my business,
don't you think?

43
00:10:46,837 --> 00:10:49,237
That's just the point.

44
00:10:49,406 --> 00:10:52,466
I have a feeling
it's not just your business.

45
00:10:53,243 --> 00:10:55,211
I'm here to give you some advice.

46
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:04,921
Such as?

47
00:11:06,557 --> 00:11:10,118
Go on.
I want to hear the end.

48
00:11:10,561 --> 00:11:12,085
That is the end.

49
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,026
This isn't a threat.

50
00:11:18,635 --> 00:11:21,229
Just a simple warning.

51
00:11:21,872 --> 00:11:23,806
You mind explaining that?

52
00:11:24,074 --> 00:11:28,408
Well, if you value
your peace of mind...

53
00:11:33,851 --> 00:11:36,786
- What can I get you?
- Nothing, thanks. Here.

54
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:43,452
What some people will do
for an ice cream!

55
00:11:54,805 --> 00:11:58,969
Tomorrow at 4:00, then -
on the dot, eh?

56
00:11:59,143 --> 00:12:02,476
- I need to use the phone.
- Sorry. Go ahead.

57
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,911
Good-bye.
See you tomorrow.

58
00:12:11,588 --> 00:12:12,577
It's me.

59
00:12:12,756 --> 00:12:15,623
I've got something amusing to tell you.
Can we meet?

60
00:13:27,798 --> 00:13:30,358
Could you get that?
My secretary's gone.

61
00:13:30,534 --> 00:13:31,660
Sure.

62
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,607
Who is it?

63
00:13:37,774 --> 00:13:39,765
<i>I'd like to speak to the doctor,</i>

64
00:13:39,943 --> 00:13:42,309
She's busy. May I help?

65
00:13:42,913 --> 00:13:44,642
My name's Farra too.

66
00:13:44,948 --> 00:13:47,542
I don't understand.
Are you a gynecologist too?

67
00:13:47,718 --> 00:13:48,844
No.

68
00:13:49,219 --> 00:13:53,815
I meant the doctor is my sister.
That makes me her brother.

69
00:13:55,058 --> 00:13:58,391
I'm calling for an appointment,
not to play games.

70
00:13:58,962 --> 00:14:02,159
You're right. Forgive me.
I'm sorry.

71
00:14:05,102 --> 00:14:06,899
Niccolo Farra, the film director?

72
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:08,833
<i>That's what they call us,</i>

73
00:14:10,407 --> 00:14:12,773
Since you have to wait,

74
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:15,110
you mind telling me
what you look like?

75
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,247
<i>Why? You want to use me</i>
<i>in a film?</i>

76
00:14:17,414 --> 00:14:18,779
I don't know.

77
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:20,807
I don't know you.

78
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,917
I'm uneasy
when I can't visualize

79
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:27,787
the person I'm talking to
on the phone.

80
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,893
Here's my sister.

81
00:14:34,731 --> 00:14:36,824
<i>Could I make</i>
<i>an appointment for tomorrow?</i>

82
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,490
Just a moment.

83
00:14:41,838 --> 00:14:43,965
No, I can't tomorrow.

84
00:14:44,141 --> 00:14:46,200
Give me your name and number.

85
00:14:46,376 --> 00:14:47,900
<i>Maria Vittoria,,,</i>

86
00:14:51,481 --> 00:14:54,712
<i>Luppis,</i>
- Just a minute.

87
00:14:54,885 --> 00:14:57,581
<i>65-60-39,</i>

88
00:14:57,955 --> 00:15:01,755
Fine. I'll have
my secretary call you.

89
00:15:07,064 --> 00:15:09,157
- Can you wait a minute?
- Sure.

90
00:15:37,627 --> 00:15:41,154
If man didn't exist,
would God still exist?

91
00:15:42,499 --> 00:15:45,957
There are doubts even with man.
Imagine without him.

92
00:15:46,136 --> 00:15:47,433
It's true.

93
00:15:47,604 --> 00:15:50,198
What did God do
before creating the world?

94
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:54,177
Nothing.

95
00:15:57,547 --> 00:15:59,071
Where's your bed?

96
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:08,357
Find it.

97
00:16:12,462 --> 00:16:13,793
Your panties?

98
00:16:14,097 --> 00:16:16,759
You take them off,
but not right away.

99
00:16:16,933 --> 00:16:20,630
I hope you're not one of those
who need sex like their daily bread.

100
00:16:20,804 --> 00:16:22,999
You're the one who asked
where the bed was.

101
00:16:23,173 --> 00:16:26,040
Could we just relax for a while?

102
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:28,268
I have some problems.
- Like what?

103
00:16:29,112 --> 00:16:33,048
Not really problems.
It's just that I started late.

104
00:16:33,216 --> 00:16:34,274
Why was that?

105
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:37,249
I went to school for a year in Wales.

106
00:16:37,421 --> 00:16:39,912
Atlantic College, right on the ocean.

107
00:16:40,724 --> 00:16:44,558
Never heard of it.
Only you blue bloods know these places.

108
00:16:44,728 --> 00:16:49,097
Besides our other studies,
we specialized in lifesaving at sea.

109
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,424
Lifesaving?

110
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,669
If our canoes capsized,
we had to save each other.

111
00:16:55,372 --> 00:16:56,896
Winter, summer.

112
00:16:57,074 --> 00:16:59,804
<i>Even after meals,</i>
<i>and in rough seas,</i>

113
00:16:59,976 --> 00:17:02,740
<i>It was waves and canoes</i>
<i>all the time,</i>

114
00:17:04,681 --> 00:17:06,581
<i>But it was actually very nice,</i>

115
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:18,386
Except there was no screwing.

116
00:17:18,562 --> 00:17:21,395
It wasn't allowed,
so I had to wait.

117
00:17:22,065 --> 00:17:24,499
The college was very beautiful.

118
00:18:33,236 --> 00:18:36,501
The doctor told me
not to have sex for a few weeks.

119
00:18:36,673 --> 00:18:38,140
My sister?

120
00:18:38,308 --> 00:18:39,832
You went to see her?

121
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,308
I'm sure once won't matter.

122
00:18:44,314 --> 00:18:45,246
A cigarette?

123
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:46,640
Here.

124
00:18:49,486 --> 00:18:51,420
Is that why the other night -

125
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,818
Please, I don't like
to talk about sex.

126
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:56,025
God forbid!

127
00:19:20,317 --> 00:19:21,716
I know.

128
00:19:21,885 --> 00:19:24,513
I'm incapable of being
on time. Sorry.

129
00:19:25,855 --> 00:19:27,220
What is it?

130
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,915
Any suitors after you recently?

131
00:19:30,093 --> 00:19:31,822
There's always someone.

132
00:19:31,995 --> 00:19:34,327
No, I mean one in particular.

133
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:37,259
Probably rich and middle-aged.

134
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,967
Why?

135
00:19:40,203 --> 00:19:44,264
This certain person even sent
a stooge to threaten me.

136
00:19:44,441 --> 00:19:45,840
What?

137
00:19:46,409 --> 00:19:48,377
Come on. Threaten you?

138
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:52,373
Two hours ago.
He called and we met.

139
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:56,479
He let me know it would be better
if I didn't see you again.

140
00:19:57,387 --> 00:19:58,752
Who is it?

141
00:19:59,022 --> 00:20:00,785
No one comes to mind?

142
00:20:01,324 --> 00:20:03,918
- Try to think.
- I'm trying.

143
00:20:06,129 --> 00:20:07,323
I don't know.

144
00:20:11,868 --> 00:20:13,529
Want me to swear?

145
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,644
Does this face ring a bell?

146
00:20:25,382 --> 00:20:26,610
You sure?

147
00:20:27,884 --> 00:20:29,545
Never seen him before.

148
00:20:31,321 --> 00:20:34,256
I say he's your lover boy's thug.

149
00:20:35,358 --> 00:20:38,486
- You think I hang around with thugs?
- Thugs, no.

150
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,796
But the Don Juans
who pay them, yes.

151
00:20:42,265 --> 00:20:45,132
Your crowd must be full of them.

152
00:20:45,302 --> 00:20:47,270
I quit that crowd a while ago.

153
00:20:51,474 --> 00:20:52,907
So what do we do?

154
00:20:54,944 --> 00:20:57,310
Yes, what do we do?

155
00:20:58,415 --> 00:21:02,613
You don't want to break up
because of some jerk, do you?

156
00:21:02,986 --> 00:21:04,453
Of course not.

157
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,251
I wonder what he looks like.

158
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:17,363
Why don't you introduce me
to some of your former friends?

159
00:21:28,545 --> 00:21:30,775
- Good evening.
- Evening, Carlo.

160
00:21:45,161 --> 00:21:47,629
- Mavi?
- Hi. How are you?

161
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:51,530
- See you upstairs?
- Of course.

162
00:21:56,239 --> 00:21:58,036
- Ah, you're here?
- Leaving already?

163
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,904
- I'll be back.
- How's Mother?

164
00:22:01,077 --> 00:22:02,476
Fine. Call her.

165
00:22:02,645 --> 00:22:04,374
- My sister.
- And him?

166
00:22:05,281 --> 00:22:08,512
One would think -
- Think what?

167
00:22:08,685 --> 00:22:11,984
- Isn't that Mavi Luppis?
- Yes, she'd disappeared.

168
00:22:12,155 --> 00:22:15,147
That you shared a canoe
with each of them at Atlantic College.

169
00:22:15,325 --> 00:22:17,384
- Why?
- You're so at ease with them all.

170
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,028
They obviously feel
at ease with me.

171
00:22:20,196 --> 00:22:22,494
Besides, I told you I like men.

172
00:22:22,665 --> 00:22:24,428
Especially in spring.

173
00:22:24,601 --> 00:22:27,195
In spring I always feel
like meeting new men.

174
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:30,897
Good thing it's still winter.
I've got time.

175
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:35,101
<i>Just a moment,</i>
<i>I have something to tell you,</i>

176
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:57,327
How are you?
Long time no see.

177
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,991
Working on a new film?
- You go see them?

178
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,694
Of course.

179
00:23:18,755 --> 00:23:20,620
You mind if we leave?

180
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:54,180
<i>I wonder if anyone</i>
<i>ever watched me while I slept,</i>

181
00:25:23,246 --> 00:25:26,613
- Who's that?
- That man makes millions a day.

182
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:28,679
What does he do with it?

183
00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:31,046
Some here have nothing,

184
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:33,381
but those with money
know where to put it.

185
00:25:33,556 --> 00:25:37,287
That's why it's not their fault
if things go badly.

186
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,258
The system is to blame.
- The what?

187
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:44,491
It's true. You think
what we have is a society?

188
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:47,727
We lack the concept
of a single society.

189
00:25:47,904 --> 00:25:50,429
Instead there's a society
for every group.

190
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,532
You have a cigarette?

191
00:25:53,309 --> 00:25:54,333
Sure.

192
00:26:04,887 --> 00:26:06,855
So now you're into politics?

193
00:26:23,172 --> 00:26:24,833
Good evening. How are you?

194
00:26:25,008 --> 00:26:27,340
Is that blond lady your wife?

195
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:31,075
You must both come to my place
for dinner. May I call you?

196
00:26:31,247 --> 00:26:32,771
Of course.

197
00:26:36,019 --> 00:26:38,146
What did you mean
by "my place"?

198
00:26:38,321 --> 00:26:40,221
Your place.
May I borrow it?

199
00:26:46,696 --> 00:26:49,995
- <i>I haven't seen you in ages,</i>
- <i>I was in Paris,</i>

200
00:26:50,199 --> 00:26:51,928
<i>What do you think</i>
<i>of the elections?</i>

201
00:26:52,101 --> 00:26:55,696
<i>I think Mitterand's very nice,</i>
<i>I hope he does well,</i>

202
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,737
<i>In any case, we'll see,</i>

203
00:27:31,607 --> 00:27:35,168
One of my ancestors
invented the double-bass.

204
00:27:52,729 --> 00:27:56,961
Tell me, is there always
this cliquish atmosphere

205
00:27:57,133 --> 00:28:00,102
at your cocktail parties
and dinners?

206
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:04,205
You all seem afraid
of being spied on.

207
00:28:04,373 --> 00:28:06,204
Can you blame us?

208
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:08,900
Many have already
fled the country.

209
00:28:09,078 --> 00:28:10,409
I see.

210
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,008
Once it was the poor
who emigrated from Italy.

211
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:16,379
Now it's this crowd.

212
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:38,770
- Really? Now what will you do?
- It's always like this.

213
00:28:44,881 --> 00:28:46,473
Let's go over there.

214
00:29:35,898 --> 00:29:38,799
- I see you like strawberries.
- And you like your wine.

215
00:29:38,968 --> 00:29:40,367
As always.

216
00:29:45,208 --> 00:29:46,573
What are you doing?

217
00:29:50,513 --> 00:29:53,346
Oh, sorry.

218
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:08,795
Excuse me, but aren't you?

219
00:30:09,699 --> 00:30:11,030
<i>Niccolo,</i>

220
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,360
Excuse me.

221
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:17,031
- Where were you?
- I want to introduce you.

222
00:30:18,841 --> 00:30:20,240
- I saw him.
- Who?

223
00:30:20,409 --> 00:30:22,434
Your admirer. I'm sure of it.

224
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:24,512
- Point him out.
- He's gone now.

225
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:27,647
How are you?

226
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:29,347
See you later?

227
00:30:30,386 --> 00:30:32,650
Is something the matter?

228
00:30:32,822 --> 00:30:35,552
Niccolo's searching
for a guest he doesn't know.

229
00:30:35,725 --> 00:30:38,250
- What has the poor man done?
- Nothing.

230
00:30:38,427 --> 00:30:40,327
Then why are you looking for him?

231
00:30:48,504 --> 00:30:52,668
If someone here was hot for me,
don't you think I'd have noticed?

232
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:57,503
I never know
if you're telling the truth.

233
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,446
So? A little dishonesty
at the right moment is called for.

234
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:07,947
It's strange how,
at one and the same time,

235
00:31:08,758 --> 00:31:10,487
you can seem
intelligent and stupid,

236
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,151
good and bad,
bitter and sweet.

237
00:31:13,529 --> 00:31:14,496
Me?

238
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:16,256
Yes, you.

239
00:31:16,432 --> 00:31:19,162
You've got all the good qualities
that usually make up a character,

240
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,734
and the flaws too.

241
00:31:20,903 --> 00:31:23,667
It's as if you're incapable of -

242
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,602
Mavi.

243
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,547
Listen...

244
00:31:33,049 --> 00:31:36,450
if you want to stay together,
we have to listen to each other,

245
00:31:36,619 --> 00:31:38,587
even the things we don't like,

246
00:31:38,754 --> 00:31:40,984
and there'll be
more and more of those.

247
00:31:41,157 --> 00:31:43,887
No, let's stay right here a while.

248
00:31:45,428 --> 00:31:46,952
I feel uncomfortable.

249
00:31:49,398 --> 00:31:51,866
They must think I'm an outsider
who's come to gawk.

250
00:31:52,868 --> 00:31:55,928
They tolerate me for your sake.
- Of course.

251
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,469
See? You think like them.

252
00:31:58,941 --> 00:32:01,569
Can't you see
I'm no longer with this crowd?

253
00:32:02,144 --> 00:32:03,543
I'm with you.

254
00:32:05,681 --> 00:32:07,444
You want me to swear?

255
00:32:09,085 --> 00:32:11,849
Yes, you're cute when you swear.

256
00:32:12,088 --> 00:32:14,852
You paid me a compliment!

257
00:32:19,695 --> 00:32:21,686
You know where the file
for 120 is?

258
00:32:21,864 --> 00:32:23,422
Find it for me.

259
00:32:24,266 --> 00:32:25,426
<i>Niccolo,</i>

260
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:34,335
Excuse me, but we were first.

261
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,273
Please be patient.

262
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,747
Who knows how long
the poor guy's been waiting.

263
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:43,550
Well, he's not the only one.

264
00:32:44,887 --> 00:32:47,321
Did you get my message?
- Yes.

265
00:33:09,078 --> 00:33:11,706
- Something happened to my sister.
- An accident?

266
00:33:11,881 --> 00:33:14,543
No, they passed her over

267
00:33:14,717 --> 00:33:17,277
for head
of the gynecology department.

268
00:33:19,755 --> 00:33:21,382
It's an abuse of power.

269
00:33:24,026 --> 00:33:27,587
I'm sure it's my fault.
- What do you mean?

270
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:30,421
He's starting to carry out
his threats.

271
00:33:32,468 --> 00:33:35,096
But the bastard
doesn't strike at me...

272
00:33:35,704 --> 00:33:37,467
but at someone close to me.

273
00:33:42,044 --> 00:33:43,636
That's a low blow.

274
00:34:07,136 --> 00:34:10,128
Do your parents have
any connections at the hospital?

275
00:34:10,306 --> 00:34:14,140
My mother might,
but you can't get her to do anything.

276
00:34:19,982 --> 00:34:21,279
What's wrong?

277
00:34:22,952 --> 00:34:25,648
- I'm really angry.
- Why?

278
00:34:25,821 --> 00:34:29,951
My mother's long-time lover
won't leave me alone.

279
00:34:30,793 --> 00:34:32,784
He keeps phoning,
asking to see me.

280
00:34:32,962 --> 00:34:34,987
Remember
that party at Dandini's

281
00:34:35,431 --> 00:34:38,366
when I stopped
to talk to a man?

282
00:34:39,935 --> 00:34:42,199
May I speak to you
for a moment?

283
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:46,201
There's something I've wanted
to tell you for so long now.

284
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,070
May I one of these days?

285
00:34:48,244 --> 00:34:49,871
Tell me now.

286
00:34:55,284 --> 00:34:57,650
You mean something
that happened 20 years ago?

287
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,549
- How did you know?
- Intuition.

288
00:35:00,022 --> 00:35:02,684
Paternity
isn't an abstract concept.

289
00:35:02,858 --> 00:35:05,759
Your mother always said
if you just looked in the mirror,

290
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,090
you'd know you were my daughter.

291
00:35:08,264 --> 00:35:10,755
I'd know no such thing.

292
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,159
Look at our hands.

293
00:35:23,812 --> 00:35:26,406
I've hated him
ever since I was a child.

294
00:35:26,782 --> 00:35:29,342
But he's adored me
since the day I was born.

295
00:35:29,718 --> 00:35:32,653
But he could never tell anyone,
including me.

296
00:35:33,155 --> 00:35:36,386
He couldn't touch me,
caress me...

297
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:40,994
because I always felt
an instinctive repulsion for him.

298
00:35:41,797 --> 00:35:46,029
I thought of him as a family friend.
I always avoided him.

299
00:35:47,169 --> 00:35:48,329
Why?

300
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,475
It's not your fault.

301
00:36:02,384 --> 00:36:04,181
No, it's not, is it?

302
00:36:43,726 --> 00:36:45,557
See that girl?

303
00:36:45,861 --> 00:36:50,195
I was with a friend two days ago
when his motorcycle got a flat.

304
00:36:50,366 --> 00:36:55,099
A car was parked nearby.
I went over to borrow a screwdriver.

305
00:36:56,071 --> 00:36:59,973
She was inside,
totally naked, with a guy.

306
00:37:02,211 --> 00:37:03,178
You see?

307
00:37:03,345 --> 00:37:05,108
She recognizes me too.

308
00:39:50,446 --> 00:39:52,846
<i>Niccolo, don't forget the stamps,</i>

309
00:39:55,083 --> 00:39:57,711
<i>I may be crazy,</i>
<i>but I want to make a film with you,</i>

310
00:39:57,886 --> 00:40:01,845
<i>You'll have complete freedom,</i>
<i>I've sent the script over,</i>

311
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,237
Let's see if those
damned stamps are here.

312
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,511
A catalogue.

313
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:40,793
"Voices from the Other World,
or, Think - I Exist.

314
00:40:40,963 --> 00:40:43,796
Objective Proof
of Life After Death."

315
00:40:44,533 --> 00:40:47,229
"Complete freedom,"
and he sends me a script.

316
00:40:49,037 --> 00:40:52,165
"List of people who've communicated
with the other world."

317
00:40:52,341 --> 00:40:55,071
I almost feel like calling
one of them.

318
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:57,439
Good Lord.

319
00:42:16,458 --> 00:42:18,949
- Would you cut it out?
- Who, me?

320
00:42:19,127 --> 00:42:20,788
You disappeared. What's up?

321
00:42:20,963 --> 00:42:24,057
If I don't put an end to this,
I won't get any work done.

322
00:42:24,499 --> 00:42:27,434
Think twice before stopping it.

323
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,901
Is that why you came back?

324
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:35,608
Who was it who said, " Family life
is an intrusion on one's private life"?

325
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:43,815
I can't even think about myself,
or the film I want to make.

326
00:42:46,555 --> 00:42:48,250
What's this film about?

327
00:42:49,791 --> 00:42:51,816
I don't know the story yet.

328
00:42:51,994 --> 00:42:54,053
That's why I didn't tell you before.

329
00:42:54,496 --> 00:42:56,987
But the main character
is a woman.

330
00:42:57,165 --> 00:43:00,794
How can you know that
if you don't know the plot?

331
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:03,897
It's a feeling.

332
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:08,571
A feeling in female form.
It's hard to explain.

333
00:43:09,778 --> 00:43:12,303
- Another love story.
- I didn't say that.

334
00:43:12,614 --> 00:43:16,846
What possible meaning
can a love story have today

335
00:43:17,019 --> 00:43:21,422
with all the corruption
and decay around?

336
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:25,918
Corruption is the cement
that holds this country together.

337
00:43:26,094 --> 00:43:29,586
Besides, corrupt people
are the first to want love stories.

338
00:43:32,968 --> 00:43:34,765
I'm looking for a face...

339
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:40,640
an idea for the character,
but all I can think of is her.

340
00:43:46,381 --> 00:43:48,645
Won't she do for the character?

341
00:43:48,817 --> 00:43:53,083
Why the hell should Mavi be
in my film? She's in my life.

342
00:43:53,588 --> 00:43:55,055
Isn't it the same thing?

343
00:43:57,225 --> 00:44:00,422
Looking for a character means
looking for settings and a story line.

344
00:44:00,595 --> 00:44:02,324
And why can't you find them?

345
00:44:06,068 --> 00:44:07,763
Having a crisis, eh?

346
00:44:08,804 --> 00:44:09,702
What crisis?

347
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:16,208
Listen...

348
00:44:17,779 --> 00:44:20,304
you and I have been
discussing things forever.

349
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:26,744
We've examined and reexamined
so many theories and ideas.

350
00:44:26,922 --> 00:44:31,120
Meanwhile the world changes,
makes all our words out of date,

351
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:33,284
and becomes increasingly
impenetrable.

352
00:44:35,997 --> 00:44:37,931
Have you ever gone hang gliding?

353
00:44:39,835 --> 00:44:41,769
Me neither,
but I can imagine it,

354
00:44:41,937 --> 00:44:45,532
and that's the sort of feeling
I'd like with a woman.

355
00:44:45,907 --> 00:44:49,399
But you always have to talk
and say something.

356
00:44:50,779 --> 00:44:52,610
Silence is oppressive.

357
00:44:55,851 --> 00:44:57,318
I'd like

358
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:59,215
to be silent with a woman.

359
00:45:00,021 --> 00:45:05,084
Have the kind of relationship with her
that you have with nature.

360
00:45:10,832 --> 00:45:12,993
Unless you're crazy,

361
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:16,069
what do you do
at the ocean or in the woods?

362
00:45:16,238 --> 00:45:18,103
You just look in silence.

363
00:45:18,874 --> 00:45:22,173
But though you don't realize it,
there's still a dialogue.

364
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:25,074
You speak and you answer,

365
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,473
as if it were another person.

366
00:45:27,983 --> 00:45:32,215
My ideal woman would be
like that other person.

367
00:45:32,654 --> 00:45:34,246
Ideal woman!

368
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:37,950
Are you waiting for her?
- Yes, I am.

369
00:46:02,851 --> 00:46:06,617
Mavi, don't come over.
There's someone downstairs.

370
00:46:08,657 --> 00:46:11,057
<i>You hear?</i>
- What are you afraid of?

371
00:46:11,326 --> 00:46:13,521
I'm afraid for you, not me.

372
00:46:13,995 --> 00:46:17,453
Besides, it's not about fear.
- <i>You've lost your sense of humor,</i>

373
00:46:18,967 --> 00:46:20,992
That would be a shame.

374
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:23,738
But maybe humor itself
has changed.

375
00:46:24,973 --> 00:46:26,668
Then I won't come over.

376
00:46:27,375 --> 00:46:28,842
Hold on.

377
00:46:35,917 --> 00:46:37,544
I'm not coming over.

378
00:47:31,072 --> 00:47:33,939
Look, I've got cellulite already.

379
00:47:34,342 --> 00:47:37,334
I should be
in the flower of my youth, but...

380
00:47:37,979 --> 00:47:40,607
<i>You'll be old when no one's</i>
<i>in love with you anymore,</i>

381
00:47:40,782 --> 00:47:43,876
<i>but I'm here now,</i>
<i>so don't worry,</i>

382
00:47:44,386 --> 00:47:46,854
Are you in love with me?

383
00:48:21,489 --> 00:48:23,047
Hello?

384
00:48:23,725 --> 00:48:26,592
I ran all the way up the stairs.

385
00:48:27,062 --> 00:48:31,431
No, I'd just gone out
for some cigarettes.

386
00:48:33,802 --> 00:48:37,260
How do I know
you're not seeing this man secretly?

387
00:48:37,439 --> 00:48:39,464
<i>I've told you so,</i>
<i>Want me to swear?</i>

388
00:48:39,641 --> 00:48:40,972
No, I believe you.

389
00:48:41,142 --> 00:48:43,133
<i>You say you do, but you don't,</i>

390
00:48:43,311 --> 00:48:45,472
Whatever you say.

391
00:48:45,947 --> 00:48:48,211
- Is that man still there?
- <i>Yes,</i>

392
00:48:48,516 --> 00:48:50,950
Invite him up for a drink.

393
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:52,746
Good idea.

394
00:48:53,321 --> 00:48:55,687
I'll call you later.

395
00:51:34,082 --> 00:51:35,777
<i>My God! Who's there?</i>

396
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:37,474
It's me.
Don't turn on the light.

397
00:51:37,652 --> 00:51:39,244
<i>You're crazy, Why not?</i>

398
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:42,116
That guy at my place
followed me.

399
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:46,021
If it's dark, he'll go away.
He must have a family too.

400
00:51:46,528 --> 00:51:49,429
Then you and I will go away.
- <i>Where to?</i>

401
00:51:49,597 --> 00:51:52,532
- The country, okay?
- Yes, my love.

402
00:51:53,101 --> 00:51:56,036
My love...

403
00:52:14,889 --> 00:52:17,824
Will it be cold?
Is the place heated?

404
00:52:17,992 --> 00:52:20,153
I don't know.
It's not my place.

405
00:52:20,328 --> 00:52:23,764
I rented it a few times
in the summer.

406
00:52:24,232 --> 00:52:27,633
It might be cold.
Bring a sweater or something.

407
00:53:00,635 --> 00:53:02,193
Look.

408
00:53:02,437 --> 00:53:04,200
Think that's him?

409
00:53:06,541 --> 00:53:08,441
No, that's not his car.

410
00:53:10,211 --> 00:53:13,578
Anyone out at night
must have their reasons,

411
00:53:13,748 --> 00:53:15,477
whether silly or serious.

412
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:18,483
We think they're crooks.
You know why?

413
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:22,783
We're the ones full of suspicion,
for purely emotional reasons.

414
00:53:48,383 --> 00:53:50,078
Here comes the fog.

415
00:53:50,351 --> 00:53:53,081
- Go slow.
- Slower than this?

416
00:53:54,122 --> 00:53:57,387
- I can't see.
- We just follow the white line.

417
00:54:09,637 --> 00:54:12,572
- Sure this is the right road?
- Let's hope so.

418
00:54:20,348 --> 00:54:22,441
Can I have a cigarette, please?

419
00:54:22,984 --> 00:54:24,315
Here.

420
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:27,479
You got a light?

421
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:37,023
I don't want it. You want it?

422
00:54:37,198 --> 00:54:38,631
Okay.

423
00:54:39,434 --> 00:54:41,095
Mad at me?

424
00:54:58,186 --> 00:55:00,984
A traffic light.
What's this about?

425
00:56:41,222 --> 00:56:42,655
Nick?

426
00:56:45,059 --> 00:56:46,526
Where are you?

427
00:56:48,229 --> 00:56:49,696
<i>I'm right here,</i>

428
00:56:55,136 --> 00:56:57,104
Don't disappear like that, please.

429
00:57:00,775 --> 00:57:03,403
Think we're being
spied on here too?

430
00:57:03,578 --> 00:57:05,045
I don't think so.

431
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:07,042
I say we are.

432
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:14,582
- Why do you say that?
- I feel it.

433
00:57:14,755 --> 00:57:18,623
Very well.
Want to bet we can shake them off?

434
00:57:39,547 --> 00:57:41,014
Watch out!

435
00:57:46,287 --> 00:57:48,517
You're crazy. Stop.

436
00:57:49,023 --> 00:57:50,388
I can't see a thing.

437
00:57:50,558 --> 00:57:52,651
I said stop!

438
00:57:54,729 --> 00:57:58,756
Please stop. I'm scared.

439
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:03,468
Enough!

440
00:58:04,705 --> 00:58:06,605
I'm frightened! Stop!

441
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,451
Let me out.

442
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:47,842
You're a real -

443
01:01:28,109 --> 01:01:29,576
Excuse me.

444
01:01:31,378 --> 01:01:34,836
Have you seen a girl
with short hair in a jacket?

445
01:01:35,015 --> 01:01:38,451
Who can see anything here?
There's a mess back there.

446
01:01:38,619 --> 01:01:42,248
I don't know what happened,
but shots were fired.

447
01:01:42,423 --> 01:01:44,118
Didn't you hear them?

448
01:01:45,326 --> 01:01:47,886
It seems
someone fell in the river.

449
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:51,260
Seems there's a gang of...
- Hooligans.

450
01:01:51,432 --> 01:01:55,493
Stealing out of cars
and assaulting passengers.

451
01:01:55,703 --> 01:01:59,195
They even rang the bells.
- They sure did.

452
01:01:59,373 --> 01:02:01,034
Didn't you hear them?

453
01:02:01,208 --> 01:02:03,369
What about the ambulance?

454
01:02:04,078 --> 01:02:05,375
Are you deaf?

455
01:02:05,546 --> 01:02:08,174
I don't believe this.

456
01:03:00,701 --> 01:03:02,498
Don't you feel well?

457
01:03:40,474 --> 01:03:42,669
How long are you
gonna be mad at me?

458
01:04:17,278 --> 01:04:20,213
- It's all built on hollow ground.
- What?

459
01:04:21,248 --> 01:04:23,307
There's an old Roman villa
underneath.

460
01:04:23,484 --> 01:04:25,543
That's why they rented it to me.

461
01:04:25,719 --> 01:04:27,846
The house is sinking
into the void.

462
01:04:28,022 --> 01:04:30,490
Time exacts its revenge.

463
01:04:31,292 --> 01:04:33,726
Let's look.
I've never been down there.

464
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:47,707
Give me your hand.

465
01:04:48,275 --> 01:04:49,742
Careful.

466
01:05:06,560 --> 01:05:08,027
Come on.

467
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:09,882
It's damp.

468
01:06:13,093 --> 01:06:16,119
- It'll never light.
- Why so pessimistic?

469
01:06:16,864 --> 01:06:18,798
Don't you trust nature?

470
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:21,530
In Baku, in Russia,

471
01:06:21,702 --> 01:06:24,000
there's still a temple
to the god of fire,

472
01:06:24,171 --> 01:06:28,801
with flames rising perpetually
from the bowels of the earth.

473
01:06:29,910 --> 01:06:31,969
It's actually
petroleum that's burning.

474
01:06:34,848 --> 01:06:38,045
They're swimming in it -
lucky them.

475
01:06:47,061 --> 01:06:50,827
- I'm fond of you.
- Why don't you say, "I love you"?

476
01:06:52,966 --> 01:06:55,298
I don't think
I've ever said it in my life.

477
01:06:57,671 --> 01:06:59,104
Too bashful, perhaps.

478
01:07:00,507 --> 01:07:02,338
Tell me you love me,

479
01:07:02,676 --> 01:07:05,338
and then tell me
what it means to love.

480
01:07:16,990 --> 01:07:18,719
You don't love me.

481
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:23,454
You need me,
and that's not love.

482
01:07:26,667 --> 01:07:28,931
You need me in order to live

483
01:07:29,336 --> 01:07:30,894
or survive.

484
01:07:36,043 --> 01:07:39,535
That's everyone's problem today -
how to survive.

485
01:07:51,024 --> 01:07:52,321
I'm not wearing it.

486
01:07:52,493 --> 01:07:54,461
Why not?

487
01:07:55,362 --> 01:07:57,159
I like being cold.

488
01:07:58,465 --> 01:08:01,434
But you'd like to see me
wrapped in warm clothes

489
01:08:01,602 --> 01:08:04,230
so I don't catch pneumonia
or even a cold.

490
01:08:04,404 --> 01:08:07,464
Well, if I do, it's my business!

491
01:08:11,678 --> 01:08:13,737
You'll never catch anything.

492
01:08:13,914 --> 01:08:16,246
You're immune to disease,
like a shark.

493
01:08:16,416 --> 01:08:20,409
They can swallow a license plate
or the polio virus.

494
01:08:20,587 --> 01:08:22,418
They digest it all.

495
01:08:27,161 --> 01:08:29,061
I don't want to stay here.

496
01:08:36,170 --> 01:08:39,139
Where would we go?
There are no hotels around.

497
01:08:55,689 --> 01:08:57,884
And all those disgusting
creatures down there.

498
01:08:58,058 --> 01:09:00,549
It's sealed up.
Don't be afraid.

499
01:09:02,262 --> 01:09:04,093
You make me afraid.

500
01:09:05,566 --> 01:09:06,897
Me?

501
01:09:08,702 --> 01:09:11,193
I thought you felt
protected with me.

502
01:09:11,538 --> 01:09:13,802
Afraid you'll ruin my life.

503
01:09:15,542 --> 01:09:19,000
Couldn't your life be like our life
the last few months?

504
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:23,072
That life has been
a temporary thing for both of us.

505
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:26,845
I don't even know
any of your friends.

506
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:29,511
I know nothing about you.

507
01:09:30,691 --> 01:09:33,251
And do you like the life I lead?

508
01:09:45,806 --> 01:09:48,036
Christ, you don't mince words.

509
01:11:16,797 --> 01:11:18,094
Elena.

510
01:11:23,403 --> 01:11:25,530
Did we rent the same house?

511
01:11:25,706 --> 01:11:27,936
Did you put down a deposit too?

512
01:11:30,677 --> 01:11:32,269
No, I just...

513
01:11:48,729 --> 01:11:50,094
<i>Hello?</i>

514
01:11:50,263 --> 01:11:53,255
This is Mr. Farra.
Is Miss Mavi in?

515
01:11:53,433 --> 01:11:56,129
<i>I'm sorry,</i>
<i>She hasn't been here today,</i>

516
01:11:56,536 --> 01:11:59,198
- Is she in town?
- <i>I believe so,</i>

517
01:12:00,307 --> 01:12:03,140
Is her sister at home?

518
01:12:03,310 --> 01:12:05,278
<i>I'm sorry, but she's out,</i>

519
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:07,271
Thanks. Very kind of you.

520
01:12:08,749 --> 01:12:10,376
Too kind!

521
01:12:27,401 --> 01:12:29,767
- <i>What is it?</i>
- Mr. Farra's on the phone.

522
01:12:29,936 --> 01:12:32,404
He's looking for Maria Vittoria.

523
01:12:33,673 --> 01:12:35,300
Let him look.

524
01:13:05,939 --> 01:13:09,170
Excuse me.
You're Mavi's sister, aren't you?

525
01:13:09,876 --> 01:13:12,037
Yes. And you're Niccolo?

526
01:13:13,313 --> 01:13:17,716
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.
Try to understand.

527
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:21,719
I see.

528
01:14:54,114 --> 01:14:56,207
- Been waiting long?
- A bit.

529
01:14:57,984 --> 01:14:59,679
The doorman let me in.

530
01:14:59,853 --> 01:15:01,616
My sweet little sister.

531
01:15:03,223 --> 01:15:04,656
Come look.

532
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:08,727
What is it?

533
01:15:12,399 --> 01:15:14,458
Have you seen that nest?

534
01:15:14,768 --> 01:15:17,430
- That's not a nest.
- Then what is it?

535
01:15:17,704 --> 01:15:18,864
Who knows?

536
01:15:22,809 --> 01:15:26,006
Where are the birds
when their nests are empty?

537
01:15:26,346 --> 01:15:28,007
Just flying around.

538
01:15:29,416 --> 01:15:31,611
Did you find the stamps?

539
01:15:32,052 --> 01:15:34,646
Come on.
I've got a whole boxful for you.

540
01:16:14,394 --> 01:16:16,726
Not very talkative today, are we?

541
01:16:19,099 --> 01:16:21,966
A brother and sister,
both depressed,

542
01:16:22,135 --> 01:16:25,161
don't make a very happy pair.

543
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:29,168
When will I get to meet Mavi?

544
01:16:31,678 --> 01:16:33,305
Probably never.

545
01:16:39,352 --> 01:16:41,252
Her fault or yours?

546
01:16:43,123 --> 01:16:45,284
Why do you ask me that?

547
01:16:47,060 --> 01:16:49,324
With your wife
it was your fault.

548
01:17:13,386 --> 01:17:15,877
Lucio, you've got your stamps.

549
01:17:16,056 --> 01:17:17,353
Let's go.

550
01:17:21,327 --> 01:17:24,694
Niccolo, why don't you make
a science fiction movie?

551
01:17:27,734 --> 01:17:29,463
Not a bad idea.

552
01:18:29,629 --> 01:18:31,392
<i>Swimming,</i> please.

553
01:19:24,918 --> 01:19:26,749
You don't remember me?

554
01:19:27,620 --> 01:19:29,588
We saw each other at a party.

555
01:19:30,256 --> 01:19:31,951
No, I don't remember.

556
01:19:44,270 --> 01:19:45,737
Your boyfriend?

557
01:19:45,905 --> 01:19:47,634
No, a friend.

558
01:19:49,742 --> 01:19:51,471
You like to swim?

559
01:19:52,979 --> 01:19:54,810
Then what are you doing here?

560
01:19:54,981 --> 01:19:56,573
Nothing much.

561
01:19:57,984 --> 01:19:59,474
I like it.

562
01:20:00,086 --> 01:20:02,919
I dove when I was young too.

563
01:20:03,857 --> 01:20:05,722
I even won a medal.

564
01:20:10,630 --> 01:20:12,598
Have you ever been in love?

565
01:20:14,334 --> 01:20:16,666
Have you ever wanted to be?

566
01:20:17,770 --> 01:20:20,762
- Why not?
- I'm incapable of it.

567
01:20:21,307 --> 01:20:22,934
Are you frigid?

568
01:20:24,377 --> 01:20:26,174
You believe in chastity?

569
01:20:26,346 --> 01:20:28,314
That could be a solution.

570
01:20:30,116 --> 01:20:32,243
You don't look
like you take drugs.

571
01:20:33,152 --> 01:20:34,779
I don't.

572
01:20:37,824 --> 01:20:39,689
Then what do you like?

573
01:20:40,894 --> 01:20:42,521
I like...

574
01:20:44,230 --> 01:20:46,027
to masturbate.

575
01:20:46,766 --> 01:20:50,532
Better yet if someone else helps.
Especially a woman.

576
01:20:50,803 --> 01:20:52,327
Why's that?

577
01:20:52,505 --> 01:20:54,973
A woman does it
to give me pleasure.

578
01:20:55,375 --> 01:20:59,311
A man does it for himself,
to show off his virility.

579
01:20:59,812 --> 01:21:02,713
With a woman it's much gentler.

580
01:21:05,485 --> 01:21:08,045
- You know Mavi Luppis?
- Sort of.

581
01:21:09,422 --> 01:21:11,287
She's older than me.

582
01:21:12,158 --> 01:21:14,626
She slept
with one of my girlfriends.

583
01:21:16,863 --> 01:21:18,831
Is this girlfriend young?

584
01:21:24,404 --> 01:21:25,871
Blond?

585
01:21:31,411 --> 01:21:33,276
Your height, by any chance?

586
01:21:35,448 --> 01:21:37,040
It was one night...

587
01:21:37,216 --> 01:21:38,683
at the beach.

588
01:21:39,786 --> 01:21:41,720
We'd just finished dinner.

589
01:21:42,588 --> 01:21:44,749
There was a boxing match on TV.

590
01:21:46,559 --> 01:21:50,495
The men went off to watch
and left us two alone.

591
01:21:52,165 --> 01:21:55,066
That pissed us off,
so we ended up in bed.

592
01:21:55,468 --> 01:21:57,698
A sort of antimale protest.

593
01:22:01,274 --> 01:22:03,242
Is Mavi in Rome now?

594
01:22:04,344 --> 01:22:05,709
I don't know.

595
01:22:15,421 --> 01:22:17,548
Wait for me
and we'll leave together.

596
01:22:45,918 --> 01:22:47,783
- Am I late?
- You changed cars.

597
01:22:47,954 --> 01:22:51,788
I've changed my way
of thinking and feeling. I'll park.

598
01:23:04,137 --> 01:23:06,662
What's this?
You've gone high-fashion.

599
01:23:10,576 --> 01:23:13,374
I thought the country
made people simpler.

600
01:23:13,546 --> 01:23:15,639
I am simpler.
Doesn't it show?

601
01:23:16,382 --> 01:23:18,145
Too chic, right?

602
01:23:19,819 --> 01:23:22,310
- Why did you call?
- I wanted to see you.

603
01:23:22,488 --> 01:23:24,388
Wanted to? Not anymore?

604
01:23:24,557 --> 01:23:26,218
Sure. And you?

605
01:23:26,392 --> 01:23:28,587
What I really want to do is pee.

606
01:23:29,162 --> 01:23:32,563
- There's a bar there.
- Not in a bar. I'm sure it's out of order.

607
01:23:32,732 --> 01:23:34,700
Then let's go to the theater.

608
01:23:41,874 --> 01:23:45,332
These inconveniences
don't happen in the country.

609
01:23:45,511 --> 01:23:47,536
You slip behind a tree
and you're happy.

610
01:23:53,886 --> 01:23:58,118
I think you're happy when your body
is in tune with your thoughts and ideas.

611
01:23:58,291 --> 01:24:03,319
Mine's used to being out
among fields, rivers, trees, frost.

612
01:24:03,796 --> 01:24:05,696
Thoughts there are different

613
01:24:05,865 --> 01:24:07,924
from thoughts in the city.

614
01:24:09,102 --> 01:24:11,536
Nature's laws don't count here.

615
01:24:11,704 --> 01:24:13,934
I'd feel empty here.

616
01:24:14,107 --> 01:24:16,098
That's why I called you.

617
01:24:16,742 --> 01:24:19,302
Because you come out
with things like that.

618
01:24:19,545 --> 01:24:22,139
- Meaning?
- I like them.

619
01:24:25,952 --> 01:24:28,318
- Let's forget the theater.
- And do what instead?

620
01:24:28,488 --> 01:24:30,752
Let's get something to eat
and talk.

621
01:24:30,923 --> 01:24:32,686
Cute girls, though.

622
01:24:32,859 --> 01:24:34,656
We'll come another night.

623
01:24:36,129 --> 01:24:38,563
There's one of them now.

624
01:24:39,265 --> 01:24:40,857
Hurry up. We're late.

625
01:24:51,911 --> 01:24:54,573
You know her?
She's very sexy.

626
01:24:56,916 --> 01:24:58,975
- You wanted to pee.
- Don't worry.

627
01:24:59,152 --> 01:25:01,052
I can hold it for three years.

628
01:25:26,812 --> 01:25:29,144
<i>Why'd you come back</i>
<i>to see the show?</i>

629
01:25:29,315 --> 01:25:31,249
I didn't.

630
01:25:31,417 --> 01:25:33,647
I came back to see
how they make buns.

631
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:50,531
I've heard you're one
of those decadent intellectuals...

632
01:25:52,104 --> 01:25:54,538
that one just can't talk to.

633
01:25:54,707 --> 01:25:57,574
I'm not an intellectual,
decadent or otherwise.

634
01:25:58,277 --> 01:26:01,041
Two people told me so.
It must be true.

635
01:26:01,447 --> 01:26:03,813
I haven't heard anything about you.

636
01:26:03,983 --> 01:26:06,474
Ah yes, someone told me
you're sexy.

637
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:11,654
- Is that all?
- I'm sure people say a lot more.

638
01:26:11,824 --> 01:26:13,223
I'll ask around.

639
01:26:13,659 --> 01:26:15,490
Who are you sleeping with?

640
01:26:18,531 --> 01:26:19,998
A boy my age.

641
01:26:20,299 --> 01:26:22,358
Ouch! Your director?

642
01:26:23,903 --> 01:26:26,371
Do you sleep
with your actresses?

643
01:26:26,539 --> 01:26:28,006
Rarely.

644
01:26:31,077 --> 01:26:33,045
I'm glad it's not your director.

645
01:26:33,212 --> 01:26:34,372
Why?

646
01:26:34,547 --> 01:26:36,071
Two reasons.

647
01:26:36,415 --> 01:26:39,441
The second is that his face
would make Heine say,

648
01:26:39,619 --> 01:26:42,486
"He's as sad as a German
who died the day before."

649
01:26:42,655 --> 01:26:45,453
- Who's Heine?
- A German who died two centuries ago.

650
01:26:45,625 --> 01:26:47,024
And the first reason?

651
01:26:47,326 --> 01:26:48,691
Guess.

652
01:26:53,966 --> 01:26:56,059
The horses are down there.

653
01:26:56,869 --> 01:26:58,063
Down there?

654
01:27:00,172 --> 01:27:02,504
That's why I came here.

655
01:27:05,044 --> 01:27:08,138
Here we are. It's that house.

656
01:27:08,581 --> 01:27:10,640
That one? It's charming.

657
01:27:15,388 --> 01:27:18,323
It belongs to friends
who live in that mansion.

658
01:27:47,353 --> 01:27:48,843
Cute place.

659
01:27:56,262 --> 01:27:57,661
Sit down.

660
01:28:03,502 --> 01:28:05,026
Do I have to?

661
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:44,270
What is it?

662
01:28:44,443 --> 01:28:48,470
Oh... just thinking
about a woman.

663
01:28:50,483 --> 01:28:51,973
You think about her often?

664
01:28:52,151 --> 01:28:54,585
No, that's water under the bridge.

665
01:29:03,529 --> 01:29:05,588
I haven't ridden in ages.

666
01:29:09,368 --> 01:29:11,962
Bouncing in the saddle
gets me excited.

667
01:29:15,441 --> 01:29:17,466
How do you know how to ride?

668
01:29:17,643 --> 01:29:19,736
A friend taught me.

669
01:29:19,912 --> 01:29:21,846
Her father had a stable.

670
01:29:23,149 --> 01:29:25,947
So you run in those circles too.

671
01:29:26,452 --> 01:29:27,749
Too?

672
01:29:28,821 --> 01:29:30,448
You mean her again?

673
01:29:43,469 --> 01:29:46,063
I was already working at 16.

674
01:29:48,908 --> 01:29:53,436
I went around in a van
with a guy who sold dresses.

675
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:56,238
And I modeled them -

676
01:29:56,415 --> 01:29:59,350
10 or 20 times a day.

677
01:30:00,152 --> 01:30:04,088
I was dead tired at night.
I got 10,000 lire a day.

678
01:30:04,824 --> 01:30:06,348
That was a lot for me.

679
01:30:07,927 --> 01:30:09,656
A nice guy?

680
01:30:10,496 --> 01:30:11,986
Quite nice.

681
01:30:12,698 --> 01:30:14,131
Inexhaustible.

682
01:30:14,300 --> 01:30:18,293
After work he always wanted
to go out dining and dancing,

683
01:30:18,471 --> 01:30:20,268
but I was too tired.

684
01:30:21,073 --> 01:30:23,098
I went along just once.

685
01:30:23,976 --> 01:30:25,443
And then?

686
01:30:26,745 --> 01:30:30,613
I never slept with him,
if that's what you're asking.

687
01:30:33,886 --> 01:30:37,583
- You were thinking it, right?
- I admit it. I was.

688
01:30:38,757 --> 01:30:40,952
I must be going soft.

689
01:30:50,803 --> 01:30:53,795
I've never been to your place.
Will you take me?

690
01:30:54,406 --> 01:30:56,203
You're welcome whenever you like.

691
01:30:57,042 --> 01:30:59,704
I have today off.
Shall we meet later?

692
01:30:59,879 --> 01:31:01,005
You want the key?

693
01:31:01,180 --> 01:31:02,704
Good God, no.

694
01:31:03,282 --> 01:31:05,409
I'd be too afraid of losing it.

695
01:31:32,244 --> 01:31:33,506
Evening.

696
01:32:02,975 --> 01:32:04,499
Don't like it?

697
01:32:05,311 --> 01:32:06,710
I don't know.

698
01:32:06,879 --> 01:32:09,473
I came to see you in your place,
not the place itself.

699
01:32:09,648 --> 01:32:13,550
It's my place,
but my ex-wife decorated it.

700
01:32:13,919 --> 01:32:16,114
Where would you be
if I wasn't here?

701
01:32:16,689 --> 01:32:18,213
In my study.

702
01:32:18,691 --> 01:32:19,783
Where?

703
01:32:19,959 --> 01:32:21,392
Up there.

704
01:32:42,615 --> 01:32:44,082
Beautiful!

705
01:32:45,818 --> 01:32:47,786
What are all those pictures?

706
01:32:48,220 --> 01:32:49,949
Women, as you can see.

707
01:32:51,523 --> 01:32:52,717
For a film?

708
01:32:53,993 --> 01:32:55,756
I'm looking for a face.

709
01:32:56,662 --> 01:32:58,721
- What kind?
- Good question.

710
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:01,431
Pretty, huh?

711
01:33:02,368 --> 01:33:05,826
He's interesting too.
Very lively eyes.

712
01:33:09,274 --> 01:33:12,710
They're terrorists,
with very consistent lives.

713
01:33:16,382 --> 01:33:22,218
In their world of virility,
courage, and even cowardly acts,

714
01:33:22,388 --> 01:33:24,982
they could only have
a violent relationship.

715
01:33:25,391 --> 01:33:29,794
The girl left her husband
over ideological differences.

716
01:33:30,929 --> 01:33:32,897
She left her son with him

717
01:33:33,065 --> 01:33:34,692
and went to live
with that other man.

718
01:33:34,867 --> 01:33:37,802
She and her husband
only cross paths in the papers.

719
01:33:38,003 --> 01:33:40,164
Her husband's in prison too?

720
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:42,464
What a saga!

721
01:33:42,641 --> 01:33:44,233
Those two have
everything in common:

722
01:33:44,610 --> 01:33:47,875
Ideology, fanaticism,
covert lives, danger.

723
01:33:48,047 --> 01:33:50,208
They have to be good together.

724
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:54,378
It's normal relationships
that start having problems.

725
01:33:59,191 --> 01:34:02,092
Shall we go
to the theater or a movie?

726
01:34:09,902 --> 01:34:12,268
These came this afternoon
for the young lady who -

727
01:34:12,438 --> 01:34:14,133
There's a card.

728
01:34:19,611 --> 01:34:21,203
It's like a funeral.

729
01:34:21,413 --> 01:34:24,280
- Where shall I put them?
- You keep them, Romolo.

730
01:34:24,450 --> 01:34:26,418
What'll I do with them?

731
01:34:26,585 --> 01:34:30,316
Give them to the man downstairs.
He'll be delighted.

732
01:34:35,561 --> 01:34:38,997
Goddamned fucking flowers!

733
01:34:39,164 --> 01:34:41,758
Who would send this stuff?

734
01:34:44,036 --> 01:34:46,197
Have you ever hated someone?

735
01:34:50,042 --> 01:34:52,510
Really hated?
I don't think so.

736
01:34:57,349 --> 01:35:00,580
Is it the same girl
you mentioned earlier?

737
01:35:02,054 --> 01:35:03,919
She's not the one I hate.

738
01:35:04,089 --> 01:35:06,489
It's the guy who sends me
the chrysanthemums.

739
01:35:06,658 --> 01:35:07,682
Japanese ones!

740
01:35:08,060 --> 01:35:11,052
He should know it's over,
but he keeps on.

741
01:35:11,830 --> 01:35:14,822
Hate is one of the few things
I do believe in.

742
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,968
But there's
too much around right now,

743
01:35:17,136 --> 01:35:19,400
and he's unloading his on me.

744
01:35:22,641 --> 01:35:24,074
I'm sorry.

745
01:35:24,943 --> 01:35:27,275
No, I'm the one who's sorry.

746
01:35:29,014 --> 01:35:31,141
I'm not enough for you.

747
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:36,847
Don't think like that.

748
01:35:40,392 --> 01:35:43,020
I feel so impotent, damn it!

749
01:36:42,187 --> 01:36:46,749
<i>Second star to the right</i>
<i>That's the path</i>

750
01:36:48,026 --> 01:36:52,588
<i>And then straight on till morning</i>

751
01:36:53,765 --> 01:36:57,701
<i>You find the path on your own</i>

752
01:36:59,571 --> 01:37:03,735
<i>It leads to the island</i>
<i>of Neverland</i>

753
01:37:41,647 --> 01:37:44,138
- How are you?
- How am I?

754
01:37:44,616 --> 01:37:47,312
I gave you some advice before.

755
01:37:47,486 --> 01:37:50,421
Here's some more:
Let's not make a scene.

756
01:37:50,589 --> 01:37:53,422
Exactly. No scenes.

757
01:37:54,126 --> 01:37:54,854
Go on.

758
01:37:57,796 --> 01:37:59,093
What are you doing here?

759
01:37:59,264 --> 01:38:02,597
Nothing. My car broke down.
I was looking for a phone box.

760
01:38:02,768 --> 01:38:04,929
A phone box, eh?

761
01:38:05,103 --> 01:38:08,402
What a coincidence.
You can use the phone at my place.

762
01:38:08,573 --> 01:38:10,438
I live nearby.

763
01:38:10,976 --> 01:38:12,603
What do you want?

764
01:38:12,778 --> 01:38:16,441
No, <i>you</i> tell me who hires you
to do his dirty work!

765
01:38:29,695 --> 01:38:32,323
<i>Luckily the police chief</i>
<i>was no fool,</i>

766
01:38:33,832 --> 01:38:35,060
Thank God.

767
01:38:36,034 --> 01:38:40,130
<i>He said, " You're looking</i>
<i>for a stranger who's threatened you?</i>

768
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:43,535
<i>Everyone threatens us here,</i>

769
01:38:44,476 --> 01:38:45,636
<i>Wherever you go,</i>

770
01:38:45,811 --> 01:38:49,872
you're never safe.
Want us to lock everyone up?"

771
01:38:50,382 --> 01:38:53,647
Why do you have to find out
this man's name?

772
01:38:55,253 --> 01:38:57,278
You're right. What do I care?

773
01:39:03,362 --> 01:39:04,886
You're going out?

774
01:39:05,063 --> 01:39:06,826
I came to be with you.

775
01:39:13,405 --> 01:39:15,305
Want to know where I'm going?

776
01:39:18,043 --> 01:39:19,806
To look for her.

777
01:39:20,979 --> 01:39:24,312
- How will you do that?
- I have an idea.

778
01:39:24,683 --> 01:39:26,742
You don't even know her name.

779
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:30,754
I'm not as dumb as you think.

780
01:39:31,256 --> 01:39:34,020
Listen, forget it.
I already told you.

781
01:39:35,660 --> 01:39:37,457
I don't give a damn.

782
01:39:42,034 --> 01:39:43,661
Why that look?

783
01:39:45,437 --> 01:39:48,167
I'm trying to figure out
if you're sincere.

784
01:39:48,540 --> 01:39:50,132
Very sincere.

785
01:39:53,145 --> 01:39:56,740
Anyway, I'd rather not be
with you today. Is that okay?

786
01:39:59,751 --> 01:40:01,844
May I stay a while?

787
01:40:03,021 --> 01:40:04,318
Of course.

788
01:40:06,124 --> 01:40:08,615
Rummage around
in the drawers if you like.

789
01:40:08,927 --> 01:40:11,293
I'd rather rummage around in here.

790
01:40:17,569 --> 01:40:20,231
No hard feelings, right?

791
01:40:31,249 --> 01:40:33,274
See you tomorrow, okay?

792
01:41:15,427 --> 01:41:17,054
Still here?

793
01:41:18,630 --> 01:41:20,621
I suddenly got very sleepy.

794
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:23,127
That's for you.

795
01:41:25,070 --> 01:41:26,264
Page 41.

796
01:41:40,752 --> 01:41:42,481
How did you do it?

797
01:41:43,388 --> 01:41:44,946
Some other time.

798
01:41:45,123 --> 01:41:46,818
No. Tell me now, please.

799
01:41:48,994 --> 01:41:53,294
The florist's name was on the card
with the chrysanthemums.

800
01:41:53,765 --> 01:41:55,596
What idiots!

801
01:41:55,767 --> 01:41:57,234
So?

802
01:41:57,469 --> 01:41:59,232
So I went there.

803
01:42:00,372 --> 01:42:03,603
They said a woman
had ordered the flowers.

804
01:42:04,976 --> 01:42:08,241
Probably a secretary.
- Whose?

805
01:42:08,413 --> 01:42:10,244
I didn't ask.

806
01:42:10,415 --> 01:42:12,246
I was looking for her, not him.

807
01:42:12,417 --> 01:42:14,248
But what led you to her?

808
01:42:14,419 --> 01:42:17,684
This copy of <i>Time</i>
was at the florist's.

809
01:42:20,759 --> 01:42:22,784
A florist who reads <i>Time?</i>

810
01:42:23,562 --> 01:42:24,654
Come on.

811
01:42:24,829 --> 01:42:26,888
Maybe he doesn't read it,
but it was there.

812
01:42:27,065 --> 01:42:29,795
Maybe the secretary left it.

813
01:42:29,968 --> 01:42:32,664
Ida, if you're hiding
something, I'll -

814
01:42:32,837 --> 01:42:34,429
You'll what?

815
01:42:34,973 --> 01:42:38,966
You said to drop it because
you didn't give a damn about her.

816
01:42:39,144 --> 01:42:40,873
Her, not him!

817
01:42:42,447 --> 01:42:44,176
For God's sake!

818
01:42:44,749 --> 01:42:48,708
You can't spend your whole life
waiting to get revenge.

819
01:42:54,726 --> 01:42:56,250
You can't understand.

820
01:42:56,428 --> 01:42:58,828
Why not?

821
01:43:00,632 --> 01:43:02,623
I'm a human being like you.

822
01:43:04,269 --> 01:43:06,760
A different sex
only by chance.

823
01:43:08,006 --> 01:43:10,736
Tell me the truth.
Why must you know?

824
01:43:12,544 --> 01:43:16,378
It's like when I look
for the solution to a film's plot

825
01:43:16,548 --> 01:43:18,175
and can't find it.

826
01:43:19,384 --> 01:43:20,874
I have my suspicions.

827
01:43:21,553 --> 01:43:23,851
I want to know if I'm right.

828
01:43:24,322 --> 01:43:26,085
Whom do you suspect?

829
01:43:27,325 --> 01:43:29,054
The father.

830
01:43:34,399 --> 01:43:36,629
You think he's in love with her?

831
01:43:40,805 --> 01:43:44,172
Paternal love, paternal jealousy -
it happens.

832
01:43:55,420 --> 01:43:57,820
Framing a shot?

833
01:43:59,958 --> 01:44:02,290
My forehead's too big, right?

834
01:44:04,562 --> 01:44:08,293
That's what gives your face
that incredible openness.

835
01:44:23,248 --> 01:44:26,479
This girl here.
Will you help me find her?

836
01:44:27,385 --> 01:44:30,821
You want her for a film?
Can we publish that?

837
01:44:30,989 --> 01:44:33,651
No film.
I just want her address.

838
01:44:35,427 --> 01:44:36,655
All right.

839
01:44:55,814 --> 01:44:57,782
Very pretty, isn't she?

840
01:44:58,550 --> 01:45:00,017
Very pretty.

841
01:45:00,251 --> 01:45:04,187
Stay and talk a while.
We never see each other.

842
01:45:04,356 --> 01:45:07,189
I can't today. I'm in a hurry.

843
01:45:07,359 --> 01:45:09,623
She was at this address.

844
01:45:57,075 --> 01:45:58,337
Excuse me...

845
01:45:59,244 --> 01:46:01,644
do you know a girl
called Maria Vittoria?

846
01:46:01,813 --> 01:46:03,303
- Who?
- Mavi.

847
01:46:03,481 --> 01:46:04,778
Ah, Mavi.

848
01:46:04,949 --> 01:46:08,248
No, I don't know her.
Never heard of her.

849
01:46:29,607 --> 01:46:32,132
- Is Mavi in?
- Mavi who?

850
01:46:33,144 --> 01:46:35,806
There's no Mavi Luppis here.

851
01:46:38,416 --> 01:46:40,043
I see. Thanks.

852
01:46:53,298 --> 01:46:54,993
Why don't you come in?

853
01:46:55,733 --> 01:46:58,099
- Some other time.
- As you like.

854
01:49:50,875 --> 01:49:53,469
- <i>Is that you?</i>
- Who else?

855
01:49:59,250 --> 01:50:01,480
You gonna open up?

856
01:50:08,926 --> 01:50:11,656
- <i>The thing's broken,</i>
- What thing?

857
01:50:11,829 --> 01:50:14,662
<i>The lug to pull the bolt,</i>

858
01:50:14,999 --> 01:50:17,058
Why did you bolt it?

859
01:50:17,235 --> 01:50:18,827
<i>He's downstairs,</i>

860
01:50:19,003 --> 01:50:21,301
- Who?
- <i>Niccolo, He came up earlier,</i>

861
01:50:21,472 --> 01:50:24,032
<i>Maybe you should close</i>
<i>the door downstairs,</i>

862
01:50:48,599 --> 01:50:52,126
What are you doing now?
Why did you stop?

863
01:50:52,670 --> 01:50:54,763
<i>I went to get some oil,</i>

864
01:50:55,573 --> 01:50:57,404
Slide the matches under the door.

865
01:53:14,612 --> 01:53:17,240
I hope you won't be
leaving here too.

866
01:53:54,819 --> 01:54:00,018
WAITING FOR YOU AT HOME - IDA

867
01:54:03,361 --> 01:54:05,124
It's open.

868
01:54:11,669 --> 01:54:13,500
I have some good news...

869
01:54:13,838 --> 01:54:15,396
at least for us.

870
01:54:15,573 --> 01:54:19,703
One of the actors is sick.
The show's cancelled for three days.

871
01:54:22,747 --> 01:54:26,513
Do you know Venice in winter?
The open lagoon?

872
01:54:27,551 --> 01:54:30,850
Venice in winter, yes.
But what's the open lagoon?

873
01:54:31,555 --> 01:54:34,524
Past the islands, toward the sea.

874
01:55:01,352 --> 01:55:02,842
Here we are.

875
01:55:04,221 --> 01:55:05,950
This is the open lagoon.

876
01:55:11,762 --> 01:55:13,423
How solitary.

877
01:55:15,333 --> 01:55:17,733
I always have
so many friends around.

878
01:55:19,370 --> 01:55:21,099
I like lots of company.

879
01:55:25,476 --> 01:55:28,240
It's very beautiful, but sad.

880
01:55:30,982 --> 01:55:32,745
It's the water that's sad.

881
01:55:34,018 --> 01:55:36,418
The sound of the water.
Listen.

882
01:55:39,623 --> 01:55:41,557
There's no joy in it.

883
01:55:47,365 --> 01:55:48,855
Forgive me.

884
01:55:52,203 --> 01:55:53,465
For what?

885
01:55:53,637 --> 01:55:58,097
For bringing you here.
It's a sickness with me...

886
01:55:59,543 --> 01:56:02,808
a professional quirk,
finding locations like this.

887
01:56:08,052 --> 01:56:11,453
One hopes solitude
will stir the imagination.

888
01:56:13,891 --> 01:56:15,415
Forgive me?

889
01:56:17,561 --> 01:56:20,553
If not, I'll jump in
and never surface again.

890
01:56:24,368 --> 01:56:26,563
If you do, I'll follow you.

891
01:56:27,471 --> 01:56:29,530
The current
will carry me out to sea,

892
01:56:29,707 --> 01:56:32,005
where I'll be swallowed
by a whale.

893
01:56:32,343 --> 01:56:34,777
And you and every other man
who's loved me

894
01:56:34,945 --> 01:56:38,904
will roam the seas
in search of that whale.

895
01:56:40,017 --> 01:56:42,144
Like <i>Moby Dick!</i>

896
01:56:42,887 --> 01:56:45,287
- Don't count on it.
- Why?

897
01:56:45,489 --> 01:56:47,354
I don't like whales.

898
01:56:57,635 --> 01:57:00,126
On the way here
we were happy as larks.

899
01:57:04,041 --> 01:57:05,633
I still am.

900
01:57:06,143 --> 01:57:08,441
The solitude doesn't change that.

901
01:57:10,281 --> 01:57:13,717
We always imagine happiness is
somewhere other than where we are.

902
01:57:15,719 --> 01:57:18,779
That must be why there's
so much suffering in this world.

903
01:57:25,830 --> 01:57:28,321
Maybe one should
just get married first

904
01:57:28,499 --> 01:57:30,694
and resolve
all the questions later.

905
01:57:31,836 --> 01:57:33,599
Shall we get married?

906
01:57:34,872 --> 01:57:36,772
I don't see any other solution.

907
01:57:42,947 --> 01:57:45,677
Has not seeing other solutions
become a vice?

908
01:58:21,051 --> 01:58:23,178
That's our spot.
You can't dock there.

909
01:58:23,354 --> 01:58:26,084
The doorman will take care of it.

910
01:58:41,172 --> 01:58:44,573
Miss, there's a call for you.
Booth No. 1.

911
01:58:46,343 --> 01:58:48,140
Yes, I'll see to your boat.

912
01:59:00,858 --> 01:59:02,485
Are you sure?

913
01:59:10,134 --> 01:59:11,897
When did he call you?

914
01:59:12,570 --> 01:59:14,367
I don't know what to say.

915
01:59:14,972 --> 01:59:16,564
It's so exciting.

916
01:59:19,810 --> 01:59:21,505
How can I explain?

917
02:00:13,163 --> 02:00:14,960
- Good news?
- Yes.

918
02:00:22,539 --> 02:00:23,972
I don't know.

919
02:00:32,449 --> 02:00:34,246
I'm going to have a baby.

920
02:00:34,618 --> 02:00:38,145
I just got the results of the test.

921
02:01:02,713 --> 02:01:04,578
Why are you acting like this?

922
02:01:07,718 --> 02:01:09,413
You were happy a minute ago.

923
02:01:25,235 --> 02:01:27,669
You said
you were taking precautions.

924
02:01:31,041 --> 02:01:32,702
Yes, but...

925
02:01:36,580 --> 02:01:38,844
How long have we
known each other?

926
02:01:42,920 --> 02:01:44,854
I must have already
been pregnant.

927
02:02:25,262 --> 02:02:28,527
We were looking for an ending.
Here it is.

928
02:02:29,566 --> 02:02:32,433
- You talk like a director.
- I am one.

929
02:02:35,005 --> 02:02:37,303
You Italian directors
seem to be paid

930
02:02:37,474 --> 02:02:39,840
to be angry at the world.

931
02:02:41,311 --> 02:02:43,176
And laugh at it too.

932
02:02:43,347 --> 02:02:46,578
Which is just another way
of resisting it.

933
02:02:48,552 --> 02:02:52,955
But I'm at peace with everything
that happens to me.

934
02:02:59,696 --> 02:03:03,530
I'll suffer terribly
if you won't see me anymore.

935
02:03:11,341 --> 02:03:15,277
Seems there's a price to pay
for keeping the baby.

936
02:03:31,462 --> 02:03:33,089
You're my love.

937
02:03:40,737 --> 02:03:42,364
Say that again.

938
02:04:45,102 --> 02:04:46,899
You're my love...

939
02:04:52,376 --> 02:04:55,607
my feast, my New Year...

940
02:04:56,813 --> 02:04:58,610
my drug.

941
02:05:03,153 --> 02:05:05,018
You're so many things.

942
02:05:10,794 --> 02:05:13,194
But you don't
bring order to my life.

943
02:05:15,966 --> 02:05:20,130
Order for me is a guy who -

944
02:05:25,576 --> 02:05:27,635
You remember the day

945
02:05:27,811 --> 02:05:32,009
you showed me
the pictures of two terrorists?

946
02:05:34,785 --> 02:05:36,412
You said...

947
02:05:38,021 --> 02:05:40,046
"They have everything in common:

948
02:05:40,223 --> 02:05:44,489
Ideology, fanaticism,
covert lives, danger.

949
02:05:46,129 --> 02:05:49,030
They have to be good together."

950
02:05:56,173 --> 02:05:59,336
This guy - if you see him -

951
02:06:00,811 --> 02:06:02,836
and even more,
if you get to know him -

952
02:06:05,549 --> 02:06:08,017
we're good together too.

953
02:06:13,857 --> 02:06:17,520
Besides, could you be father
to a child that wasn't yours?

954
02:08:41,605 --> 02:08:43,800
<i>It's a story about a spaceship</i>

955
02:08:43,974 --> 02:08:47,068
<i>that flies right up close</i>
<i>to the sun,</i>

<i>Doesn't it burn up?</i>

957
02:08:49,146 --> 02:08:51,580

<i>what's true to life</i>
