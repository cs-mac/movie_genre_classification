1
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,251
Possum, put that up, now.

2
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,697
Our Heavenly Father...

3
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:57,672
...bless this meal and those
who are about to receive it.

4
00:02:57,878 --> 00:03:02,144
Make us thankful for your generous
bounty and your unceasing love.

5
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:05,914
Please remind us,
in these hard times...

6
00:03:06,119 --> 00:03:08,212
...to be grateful for what
we have been given...

7
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:11,154
...and not to ask for what
we cannot have.

8
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:14,989
And make us mindful of those
less fortunate among us...

9
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:18,289
...as we sit at this table
with all of thy bounty.

10
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:21,224
- Amen.
- Amen.

11
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,697
Turn your plate over.

12
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:27,137
Put your napkin in your lap.

13
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:31,444
Frank, you want to take some...

14
00:03:32,179 --> 00:03:33,305
- okra and pass it to your pa?

15
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:34,377
Yes, ma'am.

16
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:38,713
Forgot to tell you, we got a letter
from your Aunt Gladys.

17
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:42,653
She was hoping we could come
to Oklahoma and visit them...

18
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:44,721
...during your vacation.

19
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,588
But, I don't know.
I was hoping we could paint the house.

20
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,531
I'll get it.

21
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,967
Thank you.

22
00:03:58,472 --> 00:04:00,963
- Frank, one biscuit.
- Yes, ma'am.

23
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:04,667
Right on my biscuit.

24
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:07,140
Excuse me, Mrs. Spalding.
The sheriff home?

25
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:10,612
He is, but we just sat down to
dinner. Can't this wait?

26
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,341
No, ma'am. It seems like we
got a problem down...

27
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,918
It's all right!
I'll be right there, Jack!

28
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:18,888
Sorry to bother you, sheriff, but
there's a drunk Negro by the track.

29
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,424
- I thought you ought to...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

30
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,475
- Where are you going?
- With Pa.

31
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:37,540
Royce?

32
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:42,177
No one excused you from the table,
young man. You stay here.

33
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:44,880
I won't be gone long.

34
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:51,950
- Who'd you say it was?
- That Wylie boy, sheriff...

35
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:14,211
Hey, boys, get on back now,
you hear me? You hear?

36
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,377
Wylie!

37
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:24,113
Wylie!

38
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,828
Howdy, Mr. Royce.

39
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:30,291
Nice day.

40
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,794
Wylie, you're drunk as a skunk.

41
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,470
I sure am, Mr. Royce.

42
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:39,969
You know better than that.

43
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,707
I'm sorry, Mr. Royce.

44
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:46,367
- You ready to come with me now?
- Just a minute.

45
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,649
Wylie, are you done?

46
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,344
Royce...

47
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,473
Frank!

48
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:51,642
Frank!

49
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:54,405
Frank, give me my doll!

50
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:04,318
Frank. Possum.

51
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:08,121
- Give me my doll!
- Frank. Possum.

52
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:09,852
Come here.

53
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,095
Come on.

54
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,803
Something's happened to your pa.

55
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:50,937
- What do you think?
- Get her out here.

56
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,332
Ma?

57
00:07:54,374 --> 00:07:55,204
Ma?

58
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:57,601
Never you mind, hon.
Don't you look.

59
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:08,854
Come on.

60
00:08:10,623 --> 00:08:13,217
For pity's sake, what do you
think you're doing?

61
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:21,130
You get out of here. Right now.

62
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,929
- Right now, Glen. I mean it.
- Guess we can go now.

63
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:33,968
Oh, sis.

64
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:37,345
Rosalie, you go down.

65
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,415
Go inside, both of you.

66
00:08:40,553 --> 00:08:41,713
Oh, sis.

67
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:44,354
Sis, I'm so sorry.

68
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,918
I am so sorry.

69
00:08:48,595 --> 00:08:50,859
I don't want anybody to see me.

70
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:54,898
- I don't want anybody to see me.
- I'm not gonna let anybody see you.

71
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:57,964
Nobody's gonna see you.

72
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:13,677
We would have been married 15 years
this October.

73
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,652
We had two children.

74
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:24,327
And I never knew till just now
Royce had a scar right there.

75
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:31,369
I never knew that.

76
00:10:51,384 --> 00:10:52,442
I was afrai...

77
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,018
I was afraid you wasn't
gonna make it.

78
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,338
Just don't worry about anything.

79
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,770
Darling, I'm sorry.

80
00:12:24,978 --> 00:12:27,037
I just heard.
I got here as fast as I could.

81
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,374
You all right? Come here.
It's all right.

82
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,140
It's all right.

83
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:41,354
Oh, honey, everything's gonna
be all right.

84
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:43,358
I'm here now.

85
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:45,758
I know how bad you feel.

86
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:49,863
There now, there now. I'm sorry.

87
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,267
All I could think of...

88
00:12:54,874 --> 00:12:57,434
...when I saw that poor man
in there...

89
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:03,140
...was what would I do if it was you?

90
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:07,743
What would I do if something was
to happen to you?

91
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:10,149
Ain't nothing gonna happen to me.

92
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,490
I'm too ornery.

93
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:17,460
I don't think I could live
without you.

94
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:21,631
Oh, I love you.

95
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,502
I love you so much.

96
00:13:26,706 --> 00:13:28,435
I love you too.

97
00:13:43,923 --> 00:13:45,390
Sorry to hear about it.

98
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:47,252
Thank you. We appreciate it.

99
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:52,128
- Wayne.
- Viola.

100
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:55,632
- Where's Edna?
- She's in the kitchen with Margaret.

101
00:13:57,737 --> 00:13:58,704
All right.

102
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,696
Hi, Buddy.

103
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:03,273
Hello, Wayne. How you doing?

104
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:05,810
- How's Mrs. Spalding?
- She's all right.

105
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:10,346
Excuse me.

106
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:17,721
Vi...

107
00:14:17,924 --> 00:14:21,052
You want to take this for a minute?
I'll be right back.

108
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,803
Here, sug.

109
00:14:45,184 --> 00:14:47,243
Come on, you gotta eat something.

110
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:51,220
Marie Thornton made that.

111
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,558
It's real good.

112
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:03,700
Margaret.

113
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:10,268
What's gonna happen to us?

114
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:17,177
I can't support this family.

115
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:23,119
I haven't the least idea
how to go about it.

116
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:29,285
It seems...

117
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:35,490
...like I have never done anything
all my life...

118
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:37,629
...but raise kids...

119
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,502
...and take care of this house.

120
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:44,676
Royce paid all the bills.

121
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,178
I never even knew how much
salary he made.

122
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,092
What's gonna happen to us?

123
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:31,982
And thou shalt eat
the herbs of the field.

124
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:36,786
In the sweat of thy face
shalt thou eat bread...

125
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,396
...till thou return unto the ground...

126
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,198
...for out of it wast thou taken.

127
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,301
For dust thou art...

128
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:47,337
...and unto dust thou shall return.

129
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,937
Amen.

130
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:46,394
Lord, I thought those people
would never leave.

131
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:50,535
- Margaret, let me get this now.
- No, you go on and rest.

132
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,135
I'll get that.

133
00:17:58,144 --> 00:17:59,111
Evening, ma'am.

134
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:02,907
Excuse me, but I was wondering if
you have any work around here?

135
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,741
No. There's nothing here.

136
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:09,581
You go on now. Shoo.

137
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:11,353
What is it?

138
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:14,720
I was just asking if you had any
chores I can help with.

139
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,157
Oh, no, there's no work around here.

140
00:18:17,363 --> 00:18:19,593
I can make you a plate of food.

141
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:21,899
Thank you, ma'am.

142
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,996
You wait out by the gate.

143
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:25,135
Yes, ma'am.

144
00:19:10,683 --> 00:19:12,207
Excuse me!

145
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,250
Morning!

146
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:18,785
I thought I told you last night
you can't stay around here.

147
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:22,151
Well, I seen you was almost
out of firewood...

148
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:24,386
...so I thought I'd chop some for you.

149
00:19:25,364 --> 00:19:29,027
I could fix you some breakfast,
but after that, you got to go.

150
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:30,830
Thank you, ma'am.

151
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:44,039
You know, ma'am...

152
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:48,084
...you got a nice henhouse over here.

153
00:19:48,788 --> 00:19:51,348
Of course, it's about ready
to fall down.

154
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:55,624
A mighty good-looking milk cow.

155
00:19:56,262 --> 00:19:58,730
She sure need taking care of, though.

156
00:20:02,501 --> 00:20:05,629
There must be close to 40 acres
out back.

157
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:08,796
I reckon with the right
kind of help...

158
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:12,239
...you'd make yourself a handsome
living just farming cotton.

159
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:14,713
All you need is somebody like me...

160
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:18,577
...who knows most everything there is
to know about farming cotton.

161
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:21,553
I was thinking that maybe...

162
00:20:21,754 --> 00:20:25,053
...I could work around here for food
and a place to stay.

163
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,691
No. I can't give you any work.

164
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,885
I could fix you some breakfast,
and then you've got to leave.

165
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:39,265
- No such thing as a job, nowadays.
- I'm sorry.

166
00:20:39,472 --> 00:20:40,996
I'll fix you a nice plate of food.

167
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:43,937
You go wait out there and I'll
bring it to you, okay?

168
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,541
Yes, ma'am.

169
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:57,379
I can mend this fence with no
trouble at all, right after breakfast.

170
00:20:57,957 --> 00:21:00,391
Oh, that'd be fine, just fine.

171
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:03,293
Okay. I'll be right out here.

172
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:31,850
Good afternoon, Mrs. Spalding.

173
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:33,319
Mr. Denby.

174
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:34,891
I hope I'm not bothering you.

175
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:38,257
- No. Won't you come in?
- Oh, thank you.

176
00:21:42,768 --> 00:21:45,100
- Please.
- Thank you.

177
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:52,239
Mrs. Spalding, on behalf of everyone
down at the First Farmers Bank...

178
00:21:52,444 --> 00:21:56,540
...if there's anything we can do in
this hour of need, please ask.

179
00:21:56,749 --> 00:21:57,977
Thank you.

180
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,945
Mrs. Spalding...

181
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:05,112
...I don't know how much your husband
told you about his business.

182
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:08,858
But at the close
of banking hours yesterday...

183
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:13,498
...you had a balance of $116.72.

184
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,358
However, when your husband
bought this place...

185
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:19,037
...he did borrow money from the bank.

186
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:22,567
At the time of his death
he still owed...

187
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:27,644
...$3681, to be paid twice a year.

188
00:22:29,381 --> 00:22:31,042
What that means, Mrs. Spalding, is...

189
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:36,517
...come October 15th, you will owe
the bank $240.

190
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:41,056
We were wondering if you had any idea
how you were gonna make that payment.

191
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:44,521
Yes.

192
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,355
Matter of fact, I do.

193
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:49,963
I was thinking...

194
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:53,366
Rilla Langsford and her sister
have that nice little gift shop...

195
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:55,335
...and, well, I thought I could
do the same thing.

196
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:58,874
I could get some pretty little
things, and I could set them out...

197
00:22:59,078 --> 00:23:02,411
Mrs. Spalding, why would someone
come all the way out here...

198
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:05,311
...when the Langsfords' place
is there on the square?

199
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:07,751
Oh.

200
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:12,014
Mrs. Spalding, what we at the bank
suggest is that you sell this place.

201
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,192
Now I know times are hard...

202
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:19,330
...but maybe we can pay off the loan
and have something to tide you over.

203
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:21,895
But where would we live?

204
00:23:22,101 --> 00:23:24,934
I believe you have a sister
that resides here.

205
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:28,698
No, Margaret couldn't take us in.

206
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,672
She couldn't afford it, and
besides, she hasn't got room.

207
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:34,903
Mrs. Spalding, when tragedies
like this happen...

208
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:39,508
...sometimes we have to face up to
things that are real hard.

209
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:45,581
Sometimes it's necessary to split
families up, temporarily.

210
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:48,954
I believe your husband has
some family up in Oklahoma.

211
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:51,755
I'm sure they could take one
of your children.

212
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:53,625
I can't talk about this right now.

213
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:57,097
If you'll excuse me,
you can let yourself out.

214
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:03,172
I think that just about
does the trick.

215
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:04,736
That'll be...

216
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:07,637
...75 cents.

217
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:12,979
I'll see you in a couple weeks.

218
00:24:13,185 --> 00:24:15,244
Right. Thank you, Ruby.

219
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:17,882
I didn't know you were busy.

220
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,558
That's all right.
I was just leaving.

221
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:21,885
- Bye, Ruby.
- Bye-bye.

222
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:23,755
- Kids, come on in.
- Hi, Aunt Margaret.

223
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,362
Don't touch anything, Possum.

224
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:28,158
Watch your sister.
Don't let her touch anything.

225
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:32,531
Mrs. Parks offered to buy five pounds
of tomatoes from us.

226
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:35,138
So we thought we'd come by
and say hello.

227
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,668
Where's Rosalie?

228
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,435
I'm sorry. She's gone off
with her daddy.

229
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:43,537
But if you go in the kitchen,
I got some Coca-Cola in the icebox.

230
00:24:43,749 --> 00:24:46,013
- Can we, Mommy?
- Yeah, you can.

231
00:24:47,953 --> 00:24:50,581
- Frank, split one with your sister.
- Okay, Mom!

232
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:52,780
It's all right.
You can each have one.

233
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:56,518
- What do you say?
- Thank you, Aunt Margaret.

234
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:18,946
Margaret, I've been thinking.

235
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,843
Maybe I could work for you.

236
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:26,320
I don't know much about this
work, but I could learn.

237
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,459
I'm a real good worker.

238
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:31,293
Oh, hon.

239
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:37,996
I hardly got enough customers these
days to support me and Wayne.

240
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:41,973
I understand, Margaret.
Don't you even think about it.

241
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:44,404
Kids, come on. We got to go.
It's getting dark.

242
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,805
- Here, I got $28 saved.
- I don't want that.

243
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:50,004
Take it. Wayne will just
spend it on some fool thing.

244
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,910
I don't need it.

245
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:53,641
Come on, kids!

246
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:56,685
- Bye, Aunt Margaret.
- Goodbye, Aunt Margaret.

247
00:25:58,323 --> 00:26:00,416
I swear you are just like Daddy.

248
00:26:01,193 --> 00:26:04,822
You'd think he was sawing off his
leg to ask for the least thing.

249
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:07,996
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

250
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:34,352
I'm sorry to bother you so late.

251
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:38,792
We caught this nigger with a bunch
of things I think might belong to you.

252
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:41,289
Found him down by the tracks.

253
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,127
He claimed he was working for you...

254
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:45,394
...but it looks like he was
leaving town.

255
00:26:47,773 --> 00:26:49,570
No, he's working for me.

256
00:26:50,876 --> 00:26:53,674
I needed somebody to help out around
here, and so I took on...

257
00:26:53,879 --> 00:26:55,779
Moses. Moses Hadnot.

258
00:26:55,981 --> 00:27:00,042
I took on Moses to do some chores
until I could get straightened away.

259
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:01,844
Mrs. Spalding, are you sure?

260
00:27:02,054 --> 00:27:04,215
I mean, I found
all that silver on him.

261
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:08,751
Oh, it's Mama's, and Margaret
wanted to borrow it.

262
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:12,954
If you had gone straight there and
back, you wouldn't have this trouble.

263
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:14,154
Yes'm.

264
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,398
Mrs. Spalding, are you sure
you're all right?

265
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:19,968
Well...

266
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,204
...good night.

267
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:23,806
Good night, Jack.

268
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,325
Ma'am, I appreciate what
you've done...

269
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,794
How much could I make
if I was to plant cotton?

270
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,125
Cotton?

271
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:51,331
Well, last year cotton fetched
six cents a pound.

272
00:27:51,537 --> 00:27:54,472
You got, say, 30 acres here,
you figure...

273
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:57,404
That's 300 and some dollars.
If you take out...

274
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:59,270
You sure you can do it?

275
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:02,537
Ma'am, I been chopping cotton since
I was 5 years old.

276
00:28:02,748 --> 00:28:04,875
I know all there is to know
about cotton.

277
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:09,052
All right, you stay in
the shed beside the barn.

278
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:11,916
Ma'am, I wanted to say
that I appreciate...

279
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:15,457
If you ever steal from
me again, I'll shoot you myself.

280
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:16,992
You understand that?

281
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:33,736
Thank you. See you next week.

282
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:35,277
Good to see you.

283
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:40,046
- Good morning, Mrs. Spalding.
- Thanks.

284
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:43,683
Hello, Mrs. Spalding.
It's nice to see you again so soon.

285
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,255
Won't you come right in here?

286
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:52,155
Why don't you take a seat
right over there?

287
00:29:01,807 --> 00:29:03,741
Mr. Denby...

288
00:29:03,942 --> 00:29:06,536
...I was wondering if you would...

289
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,872
...show me how to fill out a check?

290
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:12,448
I never did it before,
and I'd best learn how.

291
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:17,088
Certainly, Mrs. Spalding. It's just
the simplest thing in the world.

292
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:20,747
Now up here, this is where
you put the date.

293
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,722
Mr. Denby...

294
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:26,921
...I'm thinking it won't be necessary
for me to sell my farm after all.

295
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:31,228
Of course it's necessary.
I explained all that to you yesterday.

296
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,631
- Down here...
- I was thinking...

297
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:35,602
...if I was to plant cotton...

298
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:38,799
Mrs. Spalding, you don't know
a thing about cotton farming.

299
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:42,412
- Yes, I know, but Moses says...
- Moses? Who's Moses?

300
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,581
He's this Negro man.

301
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,649
I don't know any Negro
around here named Moses.

302
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:50,413
He was just passing through, and I
gave him a job doing some chores.

303
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:55,559
You're telling me you let some Negro
hobo talk you into planting cotton?

304
00:29:55,761 --> 00:29:58,229
Did you ever hear of the Depression?

305
00:29:59,097 --> 00:30:00,223
Now...

306
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,061
...you see these?

307
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:06,835
These are all foreclosures. And
that's just in the last three months.

308
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:11,601
White men who've cotton-farmed all
their lives and can't make a go of it.

309
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:14,407
And you listening to some
no-account nigger.

310
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:16,808
You'll excuse me, Mrs. Spalding...

311
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:20,075
...but that's just about the most
ignorant thing I've ever heard.

312
00:30:21,186 --> 00:30:22,585
Mr. Denby...

313
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:24,619
...I'm not ignorant...

314
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,383
...and I'm not selling my land.

315
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:32,052
And I'm not giving my children over
to anyone else to raise.

316
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:37,065
I'm going out and I'm buying
$15 worth of cottonseed.

317
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:41,262
So I'd appreciate it if you would
show me again how to write a check.

318
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:48,408
Okay, Mrs. Spalding, that's...

319
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:54,478
Let's see, 450 pound of cottonseed
at .03 cent a pound.

320
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,017
That comes to...

321
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:59,420
...$13.50.

322
00:30:59,624 --> 00:31:01,819
- $13.50?
- Yes, ma'am.

323
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:03,654
Load up Mrs. Spalding's wagon.

324
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,625
- Miz Spalding?
- Yes.

325
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:08,123
That ain't the seed you're paying for.

326
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:12,793
He's charging you for grade-A seed,
but that's gin-run quality.

327
00:31:14,473 --> 00:31:15,770
Something wrong, ma'am?

328
00:31:16,775 --> 00:31:21,007
Mr. Simmons, I think maybe you
gave us the wrong seed?

329
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:27,109
Well, so I did.

330
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,911
That's just an honest mistake,
isn't it, boy?

331
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,353
Isn't it, boy?

332
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:35,887
Yes, sir.

333
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:40,659
Now you idiots gave Mrs. Spalding
the wrong seed.

334
00:31:40,866 --> 00:31:42,925
We're lucky her nigger caught it.

335
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:46,899
That's a smart nigger you got there.
He's a credit to his race.

336
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:56,603
Why did you have to go shoot off your
big mouth in front of that white man?

337
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:00,614
I swear, you ain't never
gonna learn nothing.

338
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:05,111
You just got yourself into
a carload of trouble.

339
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:08,190
This ain't your land.
You just passing through.

340
00:32:08,393 --> 00:32:10,156
That white woman ain't nothing to you.

341
00:32:11,196 --> 00:32:14,529
These people ain't no reason to get
yourself killed.

342
00:32:16,902 --> 00:32:17,960
Howdy.

343
00:32:20,205 --> 00:32:21,365
Howdy.

344
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:23,602
What's your name?

345
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:25,533
Moses.

346
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,245
My name's Frank.

347
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:36,317
- My pa was killed.
- I heard about it. I'm sure sorry.

348
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:39,755
He was shot.

349
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:43,286
It was a nigger killed him.

350
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:59,169
How old are you, child?

351
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:03,181
Nine, and 4 months.

352
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:07,513
You mean to tell me you got to be
9 years and 4 months old...

353
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:09,846
...and nobody told you
it's bad luck...

354
00:33:10,055 --> 00:33:12,250
...to rock a rocking chair
with nobody in it?

355
00:33:12,858 --> 00:33:15,952
Don't do no good now.
The damage is done.

356
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:19,558
I knew a man who rocked
a empty rocking chair.

357
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:22,961
Before nightfall, he got run
over by a cotton wagon.

358
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,836
Here, take this rabbit foot.

359
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:32,032
And you do what I do and
say what I say, you understand?

360
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,770
First thing is you turn around
three times.

361
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,709
One...

362
00:33:36,915 --> 00:33:38,883
...two...

363
00:33:39,084 --> 00:33:40,210
...three.

364
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:44,678
Next thing is you walk backwards.
Seven, six...

365
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:45,720
...five...

366
00:33:45,924 --> 00:33:46,754
...four...

367
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:47,890
...three...

368
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:49,856
...two, one.

369
00:33:50,061 --> 00:33:51,551
Thank you, Lord Jesus! Amen!

370
00:33:51,763 --> 00:33:53,958
Thank you, Lord Jesus! Amen!

371
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:55,897
Give back my rabbit foot.

372
00:33:56,101 --> 00:34:00,094
Got too much to do around here to go
around saving your life all the time.

373
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:09,276
If you're just gonna stand around,
you might as well be of some use.

374
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:11,676
Fetch me some of them nails
over there.

375
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:25,854
What are you thinking about?

376
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:30,034
I grew up in a place just like this.

377
00:34:31,937 --> 00:34:33,700
Boy, I hated it.

378
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:37,873
I used to run away every chance I got.

379
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:42,369
I'd sneak out of the house...

380
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:45,413
...go out behind the barn.

381
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:48,315
Then I'd...

382
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:53,518
...head out across the pasture and
down to this grove of elm trees.

383
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:57,324
And right in the middle...

384
00:34:57,529 --> 00:35:01,795
...was this little spot where I
used to go and sit all the time.

385
00:35:18,984 --> 00:35:20,281
Hello!

386
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,352
Watch your step here.

387
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:26,890
And another one.
And a little step up.

388
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:34,224
Mrs. Spalding?

389
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:37,532
Yes, Mr. Denby,
I'm in the back yard!

390
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:39,465
I'll be right there.

391
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,805
Now put that thing away.

392
00:35:47,012 --> 00:35:49,879
This woman may not like people
smoking in her house.

393
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:54,347
Now, please, for once in your life,
try and make a good impression.

394
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:06,120
Good afternoon, Mrs. Spalding.
How are you?

395
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:07,457
I'm just fine.

396
00:36:08,333 --> 00:36:11,063
I don't believe you know my
brother-in-law, Will.

397
00:36:12,237 --> 00:36:13,727
How do you do?

398
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,964
Mind if we come in?

399
00:36:17,976 --> 00:36:20,342
No. No, not at all.

400
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:28,046
Poor Will, here, lost his sight
in the big war.

401
00:36:28,253 --> 00:36:30,881
It was the Battle of the Somme,
wasn't it, Will?

402
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,592
He was a real war hero.
Weren't you, Will?

403
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:41,494
Will, he doesn't like to talk
about these things too much.

404
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,400
- Do you, Will?
- No.

405
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:49,268
Will's been living with his mama
until she passed away...

406
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:53,035
...and since that time he's been
visiting with my wife and me.

407
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:55,775
Now then, Mrs. Spalding...

408
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:59,507
...in spite of the fact
that I have great doubts about...

409
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:03,586
...this misguided attempt of yours
to hold on to this place...

410
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:07,815
...as a Christian and deacon of the
church, it's my beholden duty to...

411
00:37:08,026 --> 00:37:11,120
...reach out the hand of charity to
a human being in need.

412
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:15,493
And I got to thinking, now what better
way to help out this poor woman...

413
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,895
...than if she took in a boarder.

414
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:22,972
Someone who could move in here, and by
paying a modest rent, help her out.

415
00:37:23,942 --> 00:37:28,276
What if my brother-in-law was to
move in here and rent a room from you?

416
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,310
Move in here?

417
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:33,814
Will makes a living caning chairs
and making brooms, so don't you worry.

418
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:40,653
Oh, Mr. Denby, I'm...

419
00:37:43,161 --> 00:37:46,653
I so appreciate your thoughtfulness.

420
00:37:49,901 --> 00:37:51,835
This just isn't a good time.

421
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:56,170
Sit down, Will.

422
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,267
Will?

423
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:09,043
Mrs. Spalding...

424
00:38:10,421 --> 00:38:13,015
...speaking on behalf of the bank...

425
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:17,593
...we'd take it as a sign that you're
trying to provide for your family.

426
00:38:19,931 --> 00:38:22,695
When would you like
your brother-in-law to move in?

427
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:27,830
As a matter of fact, I have his things
out in the car right now.

428
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:43,214
Anything special you like to eat?

429
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:45,912
I'm not a very good cook,
but I'm willing to try.

430
00:38:46,624 --> 00:38:51,960
I don't want me to be here any more
than you do. I won't be any trouble.

431
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:56,156
And all I'll ask in return is to be
left alone in peace and quiet.

432
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:58,130
- I thought...
- I know what you thought.

433
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:02,568
But I don't need your help, and I
don't need you to feel sorry for me.

434
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:31,759
Honey?

435
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:34,230
I'm in back, darling.

436
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,937
Where you been?
We're real late for the dance.

437
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:43,474
Old man Wilson ought to put that
Studebaker of his out to pasture.

438
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:47,515
Not a week goes by without something
going wrong with that fool thing.

439
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:51,177
And the trouble is, he thinks he can
fix it all by himself.

440
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,516
So he goes in there
and messes everything up...

441
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:56,319
...and makes it worse than it
was in the first place.

442
00:39:56,527 --> 00:40:01,123
I think he does it on purpose,
just so I'll come out and talk to him.

443
00:40:02,634 --> 00:40:06,468
You know that carburetor I
fixed for him last week? He...

444
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,742
Where's Rosalie?

445
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:26,220
She's over at your mama's.
She's gonna sleep there tonight.

446
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:35,666
You ought not to eat that.
You'll get fat.

447
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:36,856
What about you?

448
00:40:37,068 --> 00:40:40,367
- A lot you'd notice.
- I'd notice.

449
00:40:42,307 --> 00:40:45,743
Wayne, we gotta go.
Everybody's waiting.

450
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:47,502
Wayne, you got to...

451
00:41:19,344 --> 00:41:20,504
Hi!

452
00:41:30,388 --> 00:41:31,616
Howdy.

453
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:38,790
Let's go inside and dance.

454
00:41:39,998 --> 00:41:41,863
Come on, let's go dance.

455
00:41:45,737 --> 00:41:47,295
I'll get it. I'll get it.

456
00:41:48,306 --> 00:41:49,898
Thank you, baby.

457
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,246
- You warm enough?
- I'm fine.

458
00:41:57,448 --> 00:41:58,745
You sure?

459
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,313
- Want my coat?
- No.

460
00:42:02,487 --> 00:42:04,421
That's a nice table.

461
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:06,320
Hey, Wayne!

462
00:42:06,758 --> 00:42:08,020
Howdy, Hank.

463
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:13,063
I sure am glad Rosalie took
that little trip tonight.

464
00:42:13,264 --> 00:42:15,095
Why are you saying that?

465
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:17,699
Where were you two?
We were getting worried.

466
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:19,836
- Where you been?
- Hi, you guys!

467
00:42:20,071 --> 00:42:22,232
- Hi, Buddy.
- Come here. I'll buy us a drink.

468
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,806
We're getting a bottle
of good-for-what-ails-you.

469
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:26,169
Be right back.

470
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,277
Just be a minute.

471
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,274
- How you been?
- I been just fine.

472
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:35,145
Hey, I hear you...

473
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:39,089
Where were you two?

474
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,911
Put that down. Come on.

475
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,101
Frank, are you craz...?

476
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:06,231
That man catches us in here,
he's gonna skin us alive.

477
00:44:06,444 --> 00:44:09,777
I got something important to show you.
Do you want to see it or not?

478
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:34,329
Recordings for the Blind presents:

479
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:37,833
Trent's Last Case, by E.C. Bentley.

480
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:40,533
Chapter one, "Bad News."

481
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:44,544
Between what matters
and what seems to matter...

482
00:44:44,749 --> 00:44:48,378
...how should the world we know
judge wisely?

483
00:44:48,586 --> 00:44:52,647
When the scheming, indomitable brain
of Sigfried Manderson was scattered...

484
00:44:52,857 --> 00:44:54,757
Frank!

485
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,618
Possum!

486
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:01,630
Coming, Mama!

487
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:14,136
Ten minutes later, he's
driving a new Buick.

488
00:45:14,345 --> 00:45:15,972
- You through?
- Yeah.

489
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:17,738
Vi and me are gonna dance.

490
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:19,507
I don't want to dance, Wayne.

491
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,686
Don't say no. You have
to dance. Come on.

492
00:45:25,656 --> 00:45:27,783
Haven't danced all night.
Excuse me.

493
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:30,984
You look pretty tonight.

494
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:41,436
Let's go up to Dallas this weekend,
all right?

495
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:43,504
Take in a picture show...

496
00:45:43,708 --> 00:45:46,336
...then have supper out
just like an old married couple?

497
00:45:46,544 --> 00:45:49,945
You can tell Buddy you're visiting
that aunt of yours up in Dallas...

498
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:53,241
- No.
- Why not? Nobody will know.

499
00:45:53,451 --> 00:45:57,820
- Wayne, I can't go on like this.
- Honey, just be patient.

500
00:45:58,022 --> 00:46:01,981
I'll work everything out, don't worry.
Just give me a little bit of time.

501
00:46:02,193 --> 00:46:04,684
I'll think of something, all right?

502
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:09,991
What's the matter, Vi?
We'll be fine. Just trust me.

503
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:12,692
Wayne, we're not gonna see
each other anymore.

504
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:14,200
- What?
- Not like we have been.

505
00:46:14,405 --> 00:46:16,930
- Why?
- This is goodbye.

506
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:25,235
Mrs. Spalding?

507
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:28,903
Mrs. Spalding?

508
00:47:31,716 --> 00:47:33,240
Mrs. Spalding?

509
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:45,825
Yes, Mr. Will. I'm right here.

510
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,725
Mrs. Spalding, believe me...

511
00:47:48,432 --> 00:47:51,094
...if I had anyplace else to go
tonight besides...

512
00:47:51,302 --> 00:47:54,601
...the State Home for the Infirm,
I'd gladly leave right now.

513
00:47:55,306 --> 00:47:58,173
When I came here, all I asked
was to be left alone.

514
00:47:58,376 --> 00:48:01,504
I am not some kind of freak
that is here on display...

515
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:04,977
...for the amusement of those
hooligans you call children.

516
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:06,240
- I will not...
- What?

517
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:08,816
...have them vandalizing
my personal property.

518
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:12,079
Don't come in my house
and talk about my children like that!

519
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:16,020
They are not hooligans or vandals!
They're well brought up children!

520
00:48:16,227 --> 00:48:18,457
- You can't walk into my house...
- Fine!

521
00:48:30,775 --> 00:48:31,764
Fine.

522
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:36,373
Whatever they are, you just
keep them out of my room.

523
00:48:39,717 --> 00:48:41,412
That's all right, I'll get it.

524
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,721
The door's on your right.

525
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:50,655
Thank you.

526
00:49:04,008 --> 00:49:05,999
Good night, Mrs. Spalding.

527
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:08,669
Good night, Mr. Will.

528
00:49:45,749 --> 00:49:47,216
Ready, ma'am?

529
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:51,245
Get along, mules! Get along!

530
00:49:54,525 --> 00:49:56,356
Now get along, mules!

531
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:02,758
Hah! Hah! Get along there! Hah!

532
00:50:05,803 --> 00:50:07,737
Keep them straight, ma'am.

533
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:11,608
That's fine. That's just fine.

534
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:59,111
Right, Spalding. You don't know
the first thing about smoking.

535
00:50:59,323 --> 00:51:01,655
I do so. I been smoking
since I was little.

536
00:51:01,859 --> 00:51:05,420
- Then how come you can't inhale?
- I can so. I can inhale real good.

537
00:51:05,663 --> 00:51:07,426
Mr. Will! Mr. Will!

538
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:10,657
Frank got caught smoking in school
and the teacher told Ma...

539
00:51:10,868 --> 00:51:12,768
...and Frank's gonna catch it!

540
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:19,099
Frank, I'll see you
at school tomorrow.

541
00:51:31,956 --> 00:51:36,290
Well, young man? What would
your pa do if he were here?

542
00:51:37,061 --> 00:51:39,029
He'd spank me, I reckon.

543
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:43,122
I guess that's what we
got to do, then.

544
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:05,687
Frank, what's she gonna do
to you? Frank!

545
00:52:05,923 --> 00:52:08,323
- Ma, what are you gonna do to him?
- It's okay.

546
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:11,756
Ma, what you gonna do to Frank?
Are you gonna spank him?

547
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,327
Can I watch? Can I?

548
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:14,724
Possum!

549
00:52:24,375 --> 00:52:27,401
Frank, when your pa did this,
how'd he do it?

550
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:28,737
Most times...

551
00:52:29,113 --> 00:52:32,810
...I'd lean over the table, grab hold,
and he'd let me have it.

552
00:52:34,284 --> 00:52:35,774
How many times?

553
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:39,652
Pa would be mad
over something like this.

554
00:52:40,224 --> 00:52:43,716
I reckon he'd give me 10 good licks.

555
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:55,836
I'm ready.

556
00:53:09,653 --> 00:53:10,642
Ma?

557
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:12,654
I'm ready.

558
00:53:35,012 --> 00:53:36,036
What's wrong?

559
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:38,237
Frank's getting a licking.

560
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,322
Did it hurt?

561
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:56,491
Come on.

562
00:53:56,867 --> 00:53:59,802
Let's let old Frank
be by himself for a bit.

563
00:54:00,938 --> 00:54:04,237
Tell you what, why don't you help me
with my chores?

564
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:13,976
Mrs. Spalding?

565
00:54:15,185 --> 00:54:18,313
I won't do that again. Ever.

566
00:54:22,526 --> 00:54:23,925
Are you all right?

567
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:30,791
God, I miss my husband.

568
00:54:50,254 --> 00:54:53,485
Lord, I can't hardly see
my hand in front of my face.

569
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:55,453
Feels like rain.

570
00:54:55,759 --> 00:54:59,422
- Must be coming up a real storm.
- Sure is.

571
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:12,298
Help me wash dishes.

572
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:15,410
Now don't be mad, baby.
You're a good baby.

573
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:17,910
I made each of you
some cookies too.

574
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:32,993
Come on, boy. Let's git.

575
00:55:33,297 --> 00:55:34,787
Come on, git! Git!

576
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:40,660
Git on, git on! Come on! Come on!

577
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:44,405
We got to get inside, ma'am.
Storm's coming from over there!

578
00:55:44,608 --> 00:55:45,597
Git on! Git on, boy!

579
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:03,683
Come on! Let him be!

580
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:05,321
Come on, boy!

581
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:07,963
Come on, won't you?

582
00:56:08,165 --> 00:56:11,328
Let him go! Come on! Run!

583
00:56:18,809 --> 00:56:20,572
Girls, get in the schoolroom.

584
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:23,268
Boys! Robert, let's go!

585
00:56:24,014 --> 00:56:26,278
Come on! Come on! No dawdling!

586
00:56:26,817 --> 00:56:28,114
Sally!

587
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:31,851
Come on! Come along! Be careful
getting up these stairs.

588
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,547
Everybody get inside!

589
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:40,124
- Where's Frank?
- I don't know.

590
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:41,963
Let's go!

591
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:43,897
Toby!

592
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:46,463
All right.

593
00:56:57,014 --> 00:56:59,039
Get the windows open
before the house blows!

594
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:01,513
You get the dining room,
then get on the floor!

595
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:03,879
I'll get these in here! Hurry up!

596
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:11,390
You're a little baby.

597
00:57:16,466 --> 00:57:17,558
Possum!

598
00:57:44,394 --> 00:57:45,884
Here! Give me him!

599
00:57:57,541 --> 00:57:58,872
Possum!

600
00:58:24,868 --> 00:58:28,235
- Possum, it's okay.
- Mr. Will! Mr. Will!

601
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:29,598
It's okay.

602
00:58:41,118 --> 00:58:43,279
Step down! Step down!

603
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:48,324
Step down! Step down! Step down!

604
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:58,525
Frank Spalding!
There's a tornado coming!

605
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:02,032
Get on in here!
You'll get yourself killed.

606
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:05,208
I can't! I gotta get home!

607
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:24,817
Here!

608
00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:27,827
I got him, ma'am!

609
00:59:30,534 --> 00:59:32,161
Come on, Mr. Will.

610
00:59:34,771 --> 00:59:38,468
It's all right. It's all right.
Get in now.

611
00:59:41,378 --> 00:59:45,109
Mr. Will! Step down!
Step down!

612
00:59:47,951 --> 00:59:49,441
Watch your head!

613
00:59:52,656 --> 00:59:54,715
Ma!

614
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,930
- Ma!
- Oh, my God, it's Frank!

615
01:00:05,635 --> 01:00:07,933
Frank, stay there!

616
01:00:24,421 --> 01:00:25,888
Frank, come on!

617
01:00:26,089 --> 01:00:28,148
Now, come on, we got to get inside.

618
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:29,791
Come on, hurry up!

619
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,268
Get him in! Get him in!

620
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:26,175
Okay! Come on! Get in there!

621
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,384
Hurry up! Get inside!

622
01:02:56,706 --> 01:02:57,900
Get off...!

623
01:03:00,877 --> 01:03:02,174
It's okay now.

624
01:03:02,479 --> 01:03:04,811
It's all over now. Come on out.

625
01:03:05,849 --> 01:03:08,875
It's all right. It's all...

626
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:14,887
Vi?

627
01:03:18,995 --> 01:03:21,327
Hey, baby, it's okay.

628
01:03:23,033 --> 01:03:26,366
It's okay now.
Everything's gonna be all right.

629
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:30,496
Oh, darling, I was so scared.

630
01:03:31,341 --> 01:03:33,241
I was so scared something would...

631
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:37,109
I don't know what I'd do
if anything happened to you.

632
01:04:12,248 --> 01:04:13,545
Come on, ma'am.

633
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:23,484
Here, give me your hand, Mr. Will.

634
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:25,388
How bad is it?

635
01:04:26,062 --> 01:04:28,826
Everything's a little bent,
but it's still here.

636
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:00,488
Come on.

637
01:05:01,865 --> 01:05:04,766
- Come on, Vi.
- Oh, Bud, let's leave this town.

638
01:05:04,968 --> 01:05:08,233
There'll always be tornadoes.
Everybody'll always be poor.

639
01:05:08,438 --> 01:05:10,201
Nothing can work out here.

640
01:05:10,974 --> 01:05:13,807
I want to move, Buddy. Please.
I want...

641
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:15,238
Sure.

642
01:05:16,346 --> 01:05:17,711
Hold me.

643
01:05:45,141 --> 01:05:48,008
- Good morning, Mr. Will.
- Morning.

644
01:05:55,518 --> 01:05:58,351
- Morning, Mr. Will.
- Good morning.

645
01:06:00,924 --> 01:06:03,358
- Good morning, Mr. Will.
- Morning.

646
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:09,455
- In Chicago yesterday.

647
01:06:09,666 --> 01:06:12,032
Cotton held steady after dropping
to a record low...

648
01:06:12,235 --> 01:06:15,261
...of 3.5 cents a pound
over the last four days.

649
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:17,770
Poultry and eggs were down
to a seasonal low.

650
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:20,636
Corn remains unchanged.
Soybeans gained...

651
01:06:21,044 --> 01:06:24,878
So let me see.
At 3.5 cents a pound...

652
01:06:25,081 --> 01:06:27,208
...30 acres, that would be...

653
01:06:27,417 --> 01:06:29,578
That comes to $175.

654
01:06:34,057 --> 01:06:36,992
Think there's any chance
cotton prices'll go back up?

655
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:43,796
How much money you got
left in your account?

656
01:06:44,934 --> 01:06:47,402
Twenty-four dollars. That's all.

657
01:06:48,872 --> 01:06:52,308
- It's not enough for your payment.
- I know.

658
01:06:55,612 --> 01:06:57,045
I was wondering...

659
01:06:57,881 --> 01:07:01,977
What I made from my cotton
would cover most of the payment.

660
01:07:03,386 --> 01:07:04,410
Could you all...

661
01:07:04,888 --> 01:07:06,913
...maybe, wait for the rest?

662
01:07:07,290 --> 01:07:10,691
That's something only the
president of the bank can decide.

663
01:07:11,227 --> 01:07:13,787
- You shouldn't get your hopes up.
- Could you ask?

664
01:08:09,185 --> 01:08:12,643
There ain't no chance
you'll ever get that prize money.

665
01:08:13,222 --> 01:08:15,918
- It won't work.
- It's a hundred dollars.

666
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:18,457
And that plus a crop
would be enough to make the payment.

667
01:08:18,661 --> 01:08:21,425
You cannot begin to get that cotton
picked on time.

668
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:23,496
Why? Moses has said
that it's ready.

669
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:25,133
Moses always says things.

670
01:08:25,335 --> 01:08:28,395
- It's not always true.
- I said cotton comes in early here.

671
01:08:28,605 --> 01:08:29,833
But in a couple days...

672
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:32,405
...the pickers will
get up to this county.

673
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:35,203
They pick it fast
as you can say Jack Robinson!

674
01:08:35,411 --> 01:08:38,244
- Then we'll start right now!
- You got 30 acres to pick.

675
01:08:38,448 --> 01:08:39,642
The kids can help.

676
01:08:39,849 --> 01:08:41,248
That won't be nearly enough.

677
01:08:41,451 --> 01:08:44,420
- I'll pick 24 hours a day.
- Did you ever pick cotton?

678
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:46,782
After an hour, the hulls
start cutting your fingers.

679
01:08:46,990 --> 01:08:48,651
By noon your hands is bleeding.

680
01:08:48,858 --> 01:08:50,689
Later your fingers
start to swell.

681
01:08:50,893 --> 01:08:53,418
Later there ain't no feeling
in your hands.

682
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:57,259
I ain't even speaking about what
it does to your knees and your back.

683
01:08:57,467 --> 01:09:01,028
Get that through your head.
Once and for all, we can't do it.

684
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:03,501
Stop thinking about it
before you kill yourself!

685
01:09:03,706 --> 01:09:05,697
Now you listen to me.

686
01:09:05,908 --> 01:09:08,741
If we lose this place, you're going
back to begging for meals.

687
01:09:08,945 --> 01:09:10,674
They'll put you in a state home.

688
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,780
I'll lose what's left
of my family.

689
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:14,210
I won't let that happen.

690
01:09:14,417 --> 01:09:16,851
I don't care what it takes.
I don't care if it kills me.

691
01:09:17,053 --> 01:09:19,317
I don't care if it kills you.
I won't give up.

692
01:09:19,622 --> 01:09:23,058
And if the two of you do,
you can go straight to hell!

693
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:25,350
Careful with that now, hon.

694
01:09:31,267 --> 01:09:32,564
I bet she isn't ready.

695
01:09:32,769 --> 01:09:35,704
All the time we been coming here,
she's never been ready.

696
01:09:36,873 --> 01:09:39,137
I'm here. I'm coming.

697
01:09:39,442 --> 01:09:42,104
I start out an hour early,
I always end up a half-hour late.

698
01:09:42,311 --> 01:09:43,778
Okay, what can I do to help?

699
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:46,312
Get the cards
on top of the chest of drawers.

700
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:48,711
- That looks good.
- Want me to do something?

701
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:50,977
Set up the table, would you, Buddy?

702
01:10:06,469 --> 01:10:08,437
Let me help you with that,
Margaret.

703
01:10:30,793 --> 01:10:32,886
Can you find them?
Here, let me get the light.

704
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:35,995
Right here.

705
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:39,793
Come on.

706
01:11:05,695 --> 01:11:07,287
You want my peanuts, honey?

707
01:11:09,232 --> 01:11:13,669
I'll take your six, honey.
Discard and rummy.

708
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:15,869
I don't believe you.

709
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:17,638
Thirty-two here.

710
01:11:18,207 --> 01:11:21,267
Thirty-two. What's the damage,
Margaret?

711
01:11:22,145 --> 01:11:23,339
Seventy-three.

712
01:11:23,546 --> 01:11:25,070
Seventy-three?

713
01:11:28,651 --> 01:11:31,745
Listen, you two. Vi and me
got a little announcement.

714
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:36,351
Next time you want
to play cards with us...

715
01:11:36,559 --> 01:11:38,424
...you'll have to go to Houston.

716
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:41,290
I got an offer from an oil company
down there...

717
01:11:41,764 --> 01:11:43,061
...too good to pass up.

718
01:11:45,935 --> 01:11:47,425
You've lived here all your lives.

719
01:11:47,837 --> 01:11:50,067
Well, don't look at me.
It was Vi's idea.

720
01:11:50,506 --> 01:11:53,942
You know how hard it is to change
her mind once she gets it set.

721
01:11:54,243 --> 01:11:56,302
We'll miss you, Margaret.

722
01:11:57,647 --> 01:12:00,980
It's just such a wonderful
opportunity for Bud.

723
01:12:02,018 --> 01:12:03,918
We just can't pass it up.

724
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:11,282
We'll miss you a lot more
than you'll miss us.

725
01:12:15,565 --> 01:12:17,396
Congratulations.

726
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:20,097
Congratulations, Buddy.

727
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:21,667
We're real happy for you.

728
01:12:21,871 --> 01:12:25,136
Thanks. I'll get another drink.
You want one?

729
01:12:39,322 --> 01:12:40,789
It's my deal.

730
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:16,589
Whatever happened between you and Vi,
I don't want to know about it.

731
01:13:18,527 --> 01:13:20,586
I don't ever want to hear about it.

732
01:13:21,163 --> 01:13:22,494
Am I right?

733
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:26,091
Am I right?

734
01:13:29,005 --> 01:13:30,302
Yes.

735
01:13:33,009 --> 01:13:37,673
I'm not the same dumb beauty operator
you married eight years ago.

736
01:13:47,390 --> 01:13:48,721
What are you gonna do?

737
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:54,862
I don't know.

738
01:13:56,999 --> 01:13:58,626
I got the shop.

739
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:02,400
Rosalie and me can get along
without you.

740
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:07,439
I'm never going to see Viola again.

741
01:14:08,377 --> 01:14:11,574
- It's over between us.
- It's too late for that.

742
01:14:13,983 --> 01:14:16,281
I don't think I can
live with you anymore.

743
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:22,154
I don't think I love you anymore.

744
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:27,925
Please don't say that.

745
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:25,807
Lord, this ain't gonna work.

746
01:16:26,015 --> 01:16:28,984
Ain't no way we gonna get
all this cotton picked...

747
01:16:29,185 --> 01:16:31,312
...and yet you sent us
out here anyway.

748
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:34,887
I swear, sometimes I don't know
what's gotten into you.

749
01:16:59,748 --> 01:17:01,545
Mr. Will, you gotta talk
to that woman.

750
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:04,014
She won't pay me no mind,
but she listens to you.

751
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:05,881
It won't do any good.

752
01:17:06,422 --> 01:17:09,448
We only picked 2 acres today.
Should've done at least 4.

753
01:17:09,992 --> 01:17:13,120
And that's when we're fresh.
What's it gonna be in a week?

754
01:17:13,329 --> 01:17:16,457
How many pickers would it take
to get the cotton in on time?

755
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:20,767
Nine or 10, at least.

756
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:23,896
Okay. We better hire them.

757
01:17:25,207 --> 01:17:27,300
- Hire pickers?
- With what, Mrs. Spalding?

758
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:29,910
You said yourself you only had
$24 in the bank.

759
01:17:30,112 --> 01:17:32,376
That ain't near enough
to hire 10 pickers.

760
01:17:32,581 --> 01:17:34,242
I'll pay them out of the first bale.

761
01:17:34,450 --> 01:17:36,077
And what happens if you don't get
the first bale in?

762
01:17:36,285 --> 01:17:38,685
Then I'll pay them out
of the money I get from the gin.

763
01:17:38,888 --> 01:17:41,322
If you do that,
you'll have hardly any money left.

764
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:43,882
I'll take that chance.

765
01:18:10,486 --> 01:18:13,751
We ain't got much time before
them pickers in the South...

766
01:18:17,426 --> 01:18:19,792
All right, ma'am.
You got what you asked for.

767
01:18:21,463 --> 01:18:23,158
Have they had breakfast yet?

768
01:18:24,667 --> 01:18:25,998
I doubt it.

769
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:47,718
Governor Johnson appealed to
President Roosevelt today...

770
01:18:47,923 --> 01:18:51,086
...for emergency relief due to
the failure of the WPA program...

771
01:18:51,293 --> 01:18:53,158
...to get started in Dallas.

772
01:18:53,362 --> 01:18:55,489
The governor had asked
the administration...

773
01:18:55,698 --> 01:18:58,599
...for $1,000,000
in direct relief yesterday.

774
01:18:58,801 --> 01:19:02,066
Texas was allotted $500,000 instead.

775
01:19:02,271 --> 01:19:05,707
Governor Johnson said the situation
was becoming critical.

776
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:07,736
Meanwhile, in Baton Rouge...

777
01:19:07,943 --> 01:19:11,936
...Huey Long's last legislative
measures, 37 of them...

778
01:19:12,147 --> 01:19:15,878
...took a fall last Tuesday, as the
administration he left behind him...

779
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:19,384
...pushed its investigation
of his assassination 10 days ago...

780
01:19:19,588 --> 01:19:22,022
...by Dr. Carl A. Weiss, Jr.

781
01:19:23,859 --> 01:19:28,353
The Chicago Cubs retained their lead
in the National League pennant race...

782
01:19:28,564 --> 01:19:30,930
...by defeating the New York Giants
8-3...

783
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:33,601
...before a crowd of 29, 740...

784
01:19:33,802 --> 01:19:35,793
...at Wrigley Field in Chicago.

785
01:19:36,005 --> 01:19:38,405
It was the Cubs' 13th
straight victory.

786
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:42,236
Second place St. Louis Cardinals
beat Brooklyn 1-0...

787
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:45,777
The Giants are now 4 1/2
games behind the Cubs.

788
01:19:49,752 --> 01:19:53,119
The weather in central Texas today
will be clear, no sign of rain.

789
01:20:19,315 --> 01:20:21,374
Over here, Mr. Will!

790
01:20:25,921 --> 01:20:28,981
- Moze, the pickers are here.
- How you know that?

791
01:20:29,558 --> 01:20:31,526
I heard 11 trucks
pass by the house...

792
01:20:31,727 --> 01:20:33,820
...and from the direction
they were headed...

793
01:20:34,029 --> 01:20:35,894
...they were going out
to the Rapp place.

794
01:20:36,098 --> 01:20:37,929
- How much land the Rapps have?
- Four hundred acres.

795
01:20:39,368 --> 01:20:41,199
That means we got three days left.

796
01:20:41,403 --> 01:20:44,634
We ain't got no time to waste!
Let's get to work!

797
01:21:57,413 --> 01:21:58,744
Git along there!

798
01:21:59,348 --> 01:22:00,679
Git along now.

799
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:04,647
You ain't no more tired than I am.
Git along!

800
01:22:38,587 --> 01:22:39,952
Morning, ma'am.

801
01:22:55,204 --> 01:22:58,571
Mrs. Spalding, I hate to be
the one to tell you this...

802
01:22:58,774 --> 01:23:02,835
...but that sister of yours doesn't
have a natural talent for cooking.

803
01:23:10,552 --> 01:23:14,818
I got to thinking, if we all weren't
gonna die of ptomaine poisoning...

804
01:23:15,023 --> 01:23:17,389
...I'd have to do something about it.

805
01:23:23,499 --> 01:23:27,265
So I'm fixing us some green beans
like my mother used to make.

806
01:23:30,906 --> 01:23:32,373
Mrs. Spalding?

807
01:23:37,312 --> 01:23:38,939
Mrs. Spalding, are you okay?

808
01:23:43,418 --> 01:23:45,443
I was remembering a dream.

809
01:23:53,495 --> 01:23:55,326
What day is this?

810
01:23:56,832 --> 01:23:58,390
It's Friday, ma'am.

811
01:24:00,936 --> 01:24:03,029
When do we have to be at the gin?

812
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:06,839
Tomorrow morning.

813
01:25:12,341 --> 01:25:15,276
Recordings for The Blind presents:

814
01:25:15,477 --> 01:25:18,878
Trent's Last Case, by E.C. Bentley.

815
01:25:19,081 --> 01:25:21,982
Chapter one, "Bad News."

816
01:25:22,250 --> 01:25:25,515
"Between what matters
and what seems to matter...

817
01:25:25,721 --> 01:25:28,281
...how should the world
we know judge...?

818
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:41,828
You all right?

819
01:26:28,917 --> 01:26:30,111
The end.

820
01:26:49,538 --> 01:26:50,698
Ma'am?

821
01:26:53,008 --> 01:26:53,838
Miz Spalding.

822
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:56,907
Hey, Miz Spalding!

823
01:27:00,315 --> 01:27:01,748
We're finished.

824
01:27:02,651 --> 01:27:03,583
We done it.

825
01:27:06,555 --> 01:27:08,523
He'll be here any minute.
Get this straight.

826
01:27:08,724 --> 01:27:10,988
He'll try to charge you
for ginning the cotton.

827
01:27:11,193 --> 01:27:12,854
I'll tell him no, do it for the seed.

828
01:27:13,061 --> 01:27:14,961
He'll say he'll take all the seed.

829
01:27:15,163 --> 01:27:16,892
I say he can only have half.

830
01:27:17,099 --> 01:27:19,932
No, we offer a third
and settle for half.

831
01:27:20,135 --> 01:27:23,036
We gotta get 31/2 cent a pound,
even with the prize money.

832
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:25,069
You gotta remember that...

833
01:27:26,041 --> 01:27:27,474
Here he comes.

834
01:27:48,230 --> 01:27:49,959
- Howdy, Mrs. Spalding.
- Howdy, Mr. Simmons.

835
01:27:50,165 --> 01:27:52,725
Nice load of cotton.
You ought to be real proud.

836
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:56,563
Let's go into my office
and see if we can do some business.

837
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:07,047
Well, look who's here.

838
01:28:11,686 --> 01:28:13,119
Go on and have a seat.

839
01:28:14,589 --> 01:28:17,581
I ought to explain to you
how things work around here.

840
01:28:17,793 --> 01:28:22,730
I gin the cotton for a fee, then I buy
your cotton if we agree on a price.

841
01:28:22,931 --> 01:28:25,923
For ginning, it's customary
to charge $5 on the ton.

842
01:28:26,134 --> 01:28:27,567
Excuse me.

843
01:28:28,170 --> 01:28:31,469
I was told that you sometimes
gin the cotton for the seed.

844
01:28:31,673 --> 01:28:36,337
Yes, that's another way of working it.
I gin the cotton and keep the seed.

845
01:28:37,646 --> 01:28:41,412
The way it was explained to me,
you're supposed to keep...

846
01:28:42,150 --> 01:28:43,412
...a third.

847
01:28:46,154 --> 01:28:49,385
I'll tell you right now,
I won't pay that. Excuse me.

848
01:28:50,792 --> 01:28:52,419
A little too much sun.

849
01:28:52,627 --> 01:28:56,757
Out of respect for your late husband,
I am prepared to go 50/50.

850
01:28:57,766 --> 01:28:58,596
Fine.

851
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:02,236
I expect you realize the bottom
dropped out of the cotton market.

852
01:29:02,437 --> 01:29:05,702
I'm pretty much doing you a favor,
taking it off your hands.

853
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:10,804
Mr. Simmons, I want 41/2 cents
a pound for my cotton.

854
01:29:11,012 --> 01:29:13,378
You don't want me,
you want Santa Claus.

855
01:29:13,582 --> 01:29:16,574
I'll pay you 2.75
and not a red cent more.

856
01:29:17,385 --> 01:29:18,283
Four?

857
01:29:18,920 --> 01:29:21,411
Maybe you haven't heard about
the Depression.

858
01:29:21,623 --> 01:29:24,091
I can't pay that
or anything close to that.

859
01:29:24,292 --> 01:29:26,419
Three cents a pound,
take it or leave it.

860
01:29:30,966 --> 01:29:35,164
You know what your trouble is? You're
the victim of unbridled greed. 3.5.

861
01:29:38,206 --> 01:29:40,470
Ma'am, that is the honest price.

862
01:29:41,176 --> 01:29:42,302
That's it.

863
01:29:42,878 --> 01:29:44,778
I did my best. I tried to help.

864
01:29:44,980 --> 01:29:47,915
You can't blame me.
I can't do no more for you.

865
01:29:48,116 --> 01:29:52,052
Go on down to the square and see
how much you get for your cotton.

866
01:30:09,504 --> 01:30:10,630
Mr. Simmons?

867
01:30:13,608 --> 01:30:17,635
It just occurred to me. I was looking
at the pictures here on your wall.

868
01:30:17,846 --> 01:30:20,508
I remember how much store
your daddy set...

869
01:30:20,715 --> 01:30:23,343
...on ginning the first bale
of cotton each year.

870
01:30:26,321 --> 01:30:28,949
This'll be the first year
since I don't remember when...

871
01:30:29,157 --> 01:30:30,749
...that y'all aren't first.

872
01:30:31,526 --> 01:30:36,293
I guess Mr. Wheeler at Wheeler's Gin
will be pleased to meet my price...

873
01:30:36,498 --> 01:30:39,433
...just so he can show off
all next year at the Masons.

874
01:30:39,634 --> 01:30:40,760
Mrs. Spalding...

875
01:30:42,470 --> 01:30:43,960
...come back and sit down.

876
01:30:50,412 --> 01:30:52,812
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

877
01:30:54,182 --> 01:30:56,742
Let's get this wagon
to the loading bay.

878
01:30:56,952 --> 01:30:57,941
Well?

879
01:30:59,654 --> 01:31:01,713
What happened? How much did you get?

880
01:31:01,923 --> 01:31:04,721
3.75 cents per pound.

881
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:07,223
That's more than market price.

882
01:31:07,429 --> 01:31:11,832
If we'd planted the other 10 acres in
cotton, think what we would've made.

883
01:31:12,033 --> 01:31:13,830
We would've been dead.

884
01:31:14,035 --> 01:31:18,404
- Mr. Estes is selling 12 acres.
- Have you taken leave of your senses?

885
01:31:18,606 --> 01:31:21,666
- We'd have almost 60 acres of land.
- You can't afford that!

886
01:31:21,876 --> 01:31:23,741
We only need one crop of cotton.

887
01:31:23,945 --> 01:31:27,711
Just one good crop, and we could
afford to buy us a tractor.

888
01:31:28,183 --> 01:31:29,013
A tractor.

889
01:31:29,985 --> 01:31:32,044
I always wanted to have a tractor.

890
01:31:32,253 --> 01:31:36,485
I always thought if I had a tractor,
ain't no telling what I could do!

891
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:53,104
Mrs. Spalding?

892
01:31:55,977 --> 01:31:58,605
Could I trouble you for a cup of tea?

893
01:31:59,647 --> 01:32:01,979
Of course. I'll put
the water on for you.

894
01:32:05,053 --> 01:32:07,351
Do you mind if I wait in here?

895
01:32:07,555 --> 01:32:08,852
Not at all.

896
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:28,476
Trying to fix Frank's shoe.
It's got a big hole in it.

897
01:32:33,915 --> 01:32:36,383
Mrs. Spalding, can I ask you
a question?

898
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:43,619
What do you look like?

899
01:32:57,005 --> 01:33:00,736
I have long hair
and I tie it up in the back.

900
01:33:01,609 --> 01:33:03,577
And I have brown eyes.

901
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:09,341
I always wanted to have blue eyes,
like my mama, but...

902
01:33:10,218 --> 01:33:12,277
...Margaret got those.

903
01:33:16,191 --> 01:33:19,820
And my teeth stick out
in front a little...

904
01:33:23,298 --> 01:33:27,894
...because I sucked my thumb
a long time when I was a little girl.

905
01:33:38,146 --> 01:33:39,943
I'm no real beauty.

906
01:33:42,917 --> 01:33:44,214
I'm all right.

907
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:47,148
Thank you.

908
01:33:51,926 --> 01:33:53,223
Your tea's ready.

909
01:34:06,541 --> 01:34:07,974
All right, friends...

910
01:34:08,176 --> 01:34:11,839
...one of our all-time favorites:
"A Golden Dream."

911
01:34:27,829 --> 01:34:28,853
Mama?

912
01:34:30,131 --> 01:34:32,190
May I please have this dance?

913
01:34:36,204 --> 01:34:37,796
Frank Spalding...

914
01:34:38,773 --> 01:34:40,604
...I'd be most pleased.

915
01:34:53,121 --> 01:34:54,247
One...

916
01:35:18,613 --> 01:35:20,205
Twenty-five dollars.

917
01:35:20,515 --> 01:35:23,450
Miz Spalding give me $25.

918
01:35:23,851 --> 01:35:26,251
She ought not to have done that.

919
01:35:26,454 --> 01:35:30,550
She can't afford to go around...
What's the matter?

920
01:35:35,697 --> 01:35:37,289
I thought I heard something.

921
01:35:37,832 --> 01:35:40,357
Course you did. You heard me talking.

922
01:35:40,568 --> 01:35:44,265
You ought to speak with her. If
she goes around spending money...

923
01:35:44,472 --> 01:35:46,633
Moze, there's somebody out there.

924
01:35:47,442 --> 01:35:51,970
I don't expect so, but I'll go see,
just to make you feel better.

925
01:35:58,253 --> 01:36:01,120
Light's on in the barn.
Be right back.

926
01:36:44,966 --> 01:36:45,796
Get him!

927
01:36:56,044 --> 01:36:57,306
Moze!

928
01:37:01,816 --> 01:37:02,976
Hold him!

929
01:37:07,622 --> 01:37:10,853
I'm gonna hit him again.
Get hold of him for me.

930
01:37:11,059 --> 01:37:12,117
Give me him!

931
01:37:17,765 --> 01:37:21,394
- Grab him! Come on!
- Goddamn nigger son of a bitch.

932
01:37:25,406 --> 01:37:26,270
Get him!

933
01:37:27,108 --> 01:37:28,370
Moze!

934
01:37:29,544 --> 01:37:31,774
Keep out of this.
It's none of your business.

935
01:37:31,979 --> 01:37:33,970
You move away from him right now.

936
01:37:34,415 --> 01:37:37,111
Put that away, Mr. Will,
before you hurt somebody.

937
01:37:37,352 --> 01:37:38,683
Goddamn!

938
01:37:40,955 --> 01:37:41,979
Now!

939
01:38:34,809 --> 01:38:38,176
Hold it, Mr. Will. We don't have
any quarrel with you.

940
01:38:38,379 --> 01:38:41,371
Mr. Thompson, why are you
doing this to him?

941
01:38:41,883 --> 01:38:44,374
You got the wrong man.
That ain't Thompson.

942
01:38:44,819 --> 01:38:48,846
That's Mr. Thompson. I've been
selling him brooms for years.

943
01:38:49,056 --> 01:38:50,853
As sure as you're Mr. Shaw.

944
01:38:51,058 --> 01:38:54,357
And that's Mr. Simmons
over there by the barn.

945
01:38:55,396 --> 01:38:57,330
All right, boys, let's go home.

946
01:39:12,146 --> 01:39:13,545
All right, nigger.

947
01:39:14,515 --> 01:39:16,483
But I ain't through with you yet.

948
01:40:06,167 --> 01:40:07,828
- Want a Coke?
- No.

949
01:40:10,505 --> 01:40:12,473
Would you rather just go on home?

950
01:40:15,977 --> 01:40:17,569
Want to dance with me?

951
01:40:19,080 --> 01:40:20,445
I guess.

952
01:40:23,918 --> 01:40:25,146
You sure?

953
01:40:29,891 --> 01:40:32,485
- Howdy, Wayne. Margaret.
- Hi, Mr. Cheeves.

954
01:40:32,693 --> 01:40:35,685
- Good evening.
- My, don't you two look nice together.

955
01:40:35,897 --> 01:40:37,296
Thank you, ma'am.

956
01:40:44,338 --> 01:40:46,738
Been a long time
since we danced together.

957
01:40:51,512 --> 01:40:53,207
That dress sure looks pretty.

958
01:40:53,648 --> 01:40:54,979
It's new.

959
01:40:55,449 --> 01:40:57,747
The color. I really like the color.

960
01:41:05,793 --> 01:41:08,489
What do I have to do
to tell you I'm sorry?

961
01:41:30,751 --> 01:41:32,548
He's out in the shack.

962
01:41:42,096 --> 01:41:42,926
Moze!

963
01:41:46,133 --> 01:41:47,566
Yes, ma'am.

964
01:41:54,508 --> 01:41:57,033
Ma'am, I'm gonna have to be
moving along.

965
01:41:57,244 --> 01:42:01,806
Won't be long before that bunch comes
back, and I'd best be gone by then.

966
01:42:02,850 --> 01:42:04,977
What am I gonna do without you?

967
01:42:09,590 --> 01:42:13,117
I'd appreciate it if you say goodbye
to Frank and Possum for me.

968
01:42:13,427 --> 01:42:16,396
I'd soon as not have them
see me like this.

969
01:42:20,434 --> 01:42:22,902
I been making on this doll
for Possum.

970
01:42:23,104 --> 01:42:26,164
If you could give it to her,
I'd be most grateful.

971
01:42:27,008 --> 01:42:31,843
And old Frank, he had his eye on this
rabbit foot of mine for a spell...

972
01:42:32,647 --> 01:42:35,013
...so I expect he might as well
have it.

973
01:42:38,152 --> 01:42:39,141
Here.

974
01:42:40,921 --> 01:42:42,513
This is for you.

975
01:42:43,891 --> 01:42:46,689
It's a handkerchief
belonged to my mama.

976
01:42:47,094 --> 01:42:49,221
I thought maybe you could use it.

977
01:42:56,437 --> 01:43:00,498
I reckon I got a bit more attached
to this place than I intended to.

978
01:43:04,679 --> 01:43:06,340
Well, Miz Spalding...

979
01:43:11,819 --> 01:43:13,377
I'm gonna miss you.

980
01:43:23,164 --> 01:43:24,529
Yes, ma'am.

981
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:27,859
You took a no-account piece of land...

982
01:43:28,069 --> 01:43:30,697
...and people that didn't know
what they were doing...

983
01:43:30,905 --> 01:43:34,033
...and you farmed that land
better than anybody could...

984
01:43:34,241 --> 01:43:35,299
...colored or white.

985
01:43:35,976 --> 01:43:39,173
You brought in the first
bale of cotton this year.

986
01:43:40,214 --> 01:43:42,512
Don't you ever forget that.

987
01:43:43,684 --> 01:43:45,208
Yes, ma'am.

988
01:43:47,621 --> 01:43:49,384
Reckon I did that.

989
01:43:54,995 --> 01:43:56,724
I reckon I did.

990
01:44:57,124 --> 01:45:00,150
This morning we take our text
from First Corinthians...

991
01:45:00,361 --> 01:45:04,354
...the 13th chapter,
verses one through eight.

992
01:45:05,499 --> 01:45:09,196
"Though I speak with the tongues
of men and of angels...

993
01:45:09,403 --> 01:45:11,234
...and have not love...

994
01:45:11,438 --> 01:45:15,738
...I am become as a sounding brass
or a tinkling cymbal.

995
01:45:16,677 --> 01:45:18,872
Though I have the gift of prophecy...

996
01:45:19,079 --> 01:45:23,812
...and all knowledge and have not
love, I am nothing.

997
01:45:24,351 --> 01:45:29,288
And though I bestow all my goods to
feed the poor and have not love...

998
01:45:29,723 --> 01:45:32,055
...it profiteth me nothing.

999
01:45:33,060 --> 01:45:37,997
Love is patient, kind.
Love is not jealous or boastful.

1000
01:45:39,300 --> 01:45:41,768
Love never ends."

1001
01:46:03,090 --> 01:46:05,854
On the night before his crucifixion...

1002
01:46:06,060 --> 01:46:08,858
...our Lord gathered
with his disciples.

1003
01:46:10,097 --> 01:46:12,463
He broke the bread
and blessed it...

1004
01:46:12,666 --> 01:46:16,830
...saying, "Take, eat.
This is my body."

1005
01:46:17,504 --> 01:46:19,404
And he took the cup and said:

1006
01:46:19,607 --> 01:46:23,941
"Drink. This is my blood
which I shed for thee."

1007
01:46:30,918 --> 01:46:32,146
Peace of God.

1008
01:46:57,811 --> 01:46:59,210
Peace of God.

1009
01:47:34,748 --> 01:47:35,976
Peace of God.

1010
01:47:37,518 --> 01:47:38,917
Peace of God.

1011
01:47:55,402 --> 01:47:56,869
Peace of God.

1012
01:51:14,402 --> 01:51:14,869
