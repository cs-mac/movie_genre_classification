Good night.

good night.

Good night.

Here,
let me help.

554
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,815
I can do it myself.

Stop it.

556
00:41:02,659 --> 00:41:04,861
You want to sleep
in my room with me, tonight?

No.

558
00:41:12,869 --> 00:41:15,004
Don't be mad at me
about mom.

559
00:41:15,038 --> 00:41:18,141
It's not my fault.

560
00:41:18,174 --> 00:41:20,944
Don't think it's
your fault, either.

561
00:41:22,145 --> 00:41:23,947
I'm glad
she's dead.

562
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,082
You don't mean that.

563
00:41:26,115 --> 00:41:29,085
I won't
miss her at all.

564
00:41:29,118 --> 00:41:31,054
Harriet, you loved her.

565
00:41:32,989 --> 00:41:34,924
She loved you too,
very much.

00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:38,061
Sometimes, just...

567
00:41:39,262 --> 00:41:41,164
Things just

568
00:41:41,197 --> 00:41:44,033
Happen sometimes.

569
00:41:54,811 --> 00:41:55,912
Look, you don't have
to worry about

570
00:41:55,945 --> 00:41:58,047
Being an orphan,
or anything.

571
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:04,020
You got me.

Trying to tell you
something here, Harriet.

574
00:42:20,136 --> 00:42:21,204
So, um,

575
00:42:22,972 --> 00:42:25,274
I'm gonna be
your mother, now.

576
00:42:25,308 --> 00:42:27,343
What do you think
about that?

577
00:42:27,376 --> 00:42:29,145
I don't need
a mother.

578
00:42:29,178 --> 00:42:31,047
Sure you do.

579
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:34,618
My mother is in a box,
covered with dirt.

580
00:42:34,651 --> 00:42:35,619
No.

581
00:42:35,652 --> 00:42:37,253
I'm your mother.

582
00:42:42,225 --> 00:42:44,160
I had you
when I was 15.

583
00:42:50,033 --> 00:42:52,568
I was letting mom
be your mother.

584
00:42:57,206 --> 00:42:59,175
You're lying.

585
00:42:59,208 --> 00:43:01,144
No.

586
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:06,349
I'm sorry.

587
00:43:06,382 --> 00:43:09,085
I'm not.

588
00:43:15,825 --> 00:43:16,993
Go away, Gwen.

589
00:43:17,026 --> 00:43:19,963
I wish you died.

590
00:44:22,959 --> 00:44:25,361
Hey, Harriet.

591
00:44:25,394 --> 00:44:28,698
Was your mother d.O.A.?

592
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:30,199
When they pulled her out,

593
00:44:30,233 --> 00:44:31,968
She was stiff
as an ironing board,

594
00:44:32,001 --> 00:44:34,237
And flat
as a pancake,

595
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:36,105
But they couldn't
find her eyeballs.

596
00:44:36,139 --> 00:44:38,474
The impact must have
popped them

597
00:44:38,507 --> 00:44:40,810
Right out of her head.

598
00:44:52,756 --> 00:44:53,923

To page z-10.

It's in the very back,
okay?

604

605
00:45:05,401 --> 00:45:07,203
All right.

606
00:45:07,236 --> 00:45:10,039
Now, I'm gonna
start reading,

607
00:45:10,073 --> 00:45:13,142
And then if one of you
would like to read as well,

608
00:45:13,176 --> 00:45:15,711
Just raise your hand,
okay?

on me.

Now, put it on mine
very gently.

612

a question.

I'm not mad at you,
okay?

627
00:47:10,059 --> 00:47:12,195
But I want you to promise
me something.

You won't hang around
Ricky any more.

Ricky is my best friend.

He can't be, Harriet.

He's a man,
he's a grownup,

He's a retarded.

635

Hang around him long enough,
you'll start talking like him

636
00:47:36,085 --> 00:47:37,120
Or walking like him,

637
00:47:37,153 --> 00:47:39,055
Maybe even
acting like him.

638
00:47:39,088 --> 00:47:40,323
Well, at least
it'd be better

639
00:47:40,356 --> 00:47:43,592
Than walking and talking
and acting like you.

This is American slavery.
No one...

737
00:54:25,794 --> 00:54:28,397
I thought he might try to take
the bus back to San Diego,

738
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:29,865
But no one's
seen him at the station.

739

anywhere.

He might change his mind.

any idea where Ricky is,

I don't want her
to find me.

Keep kids
who make trouble.

773
00:56:28,183 --> 00:56:29,452

the same as hargrove.

01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,203
I'm sorry, Ricky.

916
01:06:50,538 --> 01:06:53,741
I'll meet you there.
I'll be right there.

917
01:06:53,775 --> 01:06:55,210
I love you.

918
01:06:55,243 --> 01:06:56,678
I sure hope you got this
out of your system,

919
01:06:56,711 --> 01:06:58,646
'Cause you're never
gonna see this place again.

920
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:00,182
That's what you think.

921
01:07:00,215 --> 01:07:02,717
What?
Nothing.

922
01:07:12,460 --> 01:07:14,662
Uh...

923
01:07:21,836 --> 01:07:24,239
Stay put.

924

Leah.

925
01:07:30,778 --> 01:07:34,349
Leah, I need
to talk to you about Ricky.

926
01:07:34,382 --> 01:07:35,750
I'm not saying
it's his fault,

927
01:07:35,783 --> 01:07:39,721
But Harriet's only
ten years old, and...

928
01:07:39,754 --> 01:07:42,524
I don't want him here.

929
01:07:42,557 --> 01:07:46,161
Ricky knows the difference
between right and wrong.

930
01:07:46,194 --> 01:07:49,131
He doesn't know anything
about what you're worried about.

931
01:07:49,164 --> 01:07:51,233
These are our
last few days together.

932
01:07:51,266 --> 01:07:53,201
I'm not made of money.

933
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:55,303
We're paid up for the week,
we're staying the week.

934

Leah.

935
01:08:04,312 --> 01:08:06,181
Harriet, go with Gwen.

936
01:08:10,285 --> 01:08:13,321
I have to know about Ricky.

937
01:08:13,355 --> 01:08:15,857
He's getting stronger.

938
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:17,459
You were right
to get help.

939
01:08:17,492 --> 01:08:19,294
I wanna see him.

940
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:21,763
No, you can't. Please.

941
01:08:21,796 --> 01:08:24,699
Go home now.

Are you gonna die soon?

944
01:08:31,773 --> 01:08:35,777
Not too soon.

945
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:37,812
Could adopt me.

946
01:08:37,845 --> 01:08:40,815
No, sweetheart.
You belong here.

947
01:08:40,848 --> 01:08:43,518
Gwen missed you very much.

948
01:08:50,258 --> 01:08:52,460
She doesn't like Ricky.

949
01:08:52,494 --> 01:08:55,430
She doesn't understand.
That's all.

950
01:08:55,463 --> 01:08:58,132
Run along.

951
01:09:10,578 --> 01:09:16,684
[Gwen]
Well, that...
that's fine.

952
01:09:16,718 --> 01:09:18,553
Mm-hmm.
Yeah. You too.

953
01:09:18,586 --> 01:09:20,788
Bye.

954
01:09:45,413 --> 01:09:46,848
That was leah.

955
01:09:46,881 --> 01:09:49,384
Ricky's just got the flu.

956
01:09:49,417 --> 01:09:51,519
Hospital's gonna
keep him another day.

957
01:09:58,893 --> 01:10:01,263
He's afraid to be alone
in the dark.

958
01:10:01,296 --> 01:10:06,401
Leah's staying with him.

959
01:10:06,434 --> 01:10:10,305
Can I go there?

960
01:10:10,338 --> 01:10:16,611
No kids.
Just immediate family.

961
01:10:16,644 --> 01:10:19,447
Somebody coming over
tonight?

962
01:10:19,481 --> 01:10:20,848
Not for a few minutes.

963
01:10:20,882 --> 01:10:22,617
You wanna sit up here
with me for a while?

964
01:10:22,650 --> 01:10:25,653
No.

965
01:10:25,687 --> 01:10:28,390
You know,
if you sit that close,
you'll get cross-eyed.

966
01:10:28,423 --> 01:10:31,693
I don't care.

967
01:10:40,034 --> 01:10:43,771
Gwen, are wives
immediate family?

968
01:10:43,805 --> 01:10:47,309
Sure.

01:10:47,342 --> 01:10:54,382

is my hair too high?

Just go sit down
over there, please.

977
01:11:11,833 --> 01:11:13,535
But we're married.

He says I am.

about this later.

was mostly upset

987
01:11:39,994 --> 01:11:43,398
That I got married before her.

988

be friends at all.

I grant you three wishes.

Okay.

1031
01:17:01,949 --> 01:17:03,350
I wanna stay here.

1032
01:17:03,384 --> 01:17:05,052
That's one. Got two more.

1033
01:17:05,086 --> 01:17:07,922
Hmm. I want my mom
to live forever.

You got one more.

a hundred more wishes!

1036

That last wish of Ricky's,
I could grant.

1041
01:17:45,059 --> 01:17:48,062
And it didn't take
any magic powers.

1042
01:17:51,132 --> 01:17:52,834
What'd you tell your mom?

1043
01:17:52,867 --> 01:17:55,770
I said I was watching TV.

1049
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:27,468
Have anything
for show and tell today?

1050
01:18:27,501 --> 01:18:29,904
Sonja.

1051
01:18:34,475 --> 01:18:35,442
Here you go, Ms. mosher.

1052

[Children murmur]

1053
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:42,449
Um, I think that everyone
should collect something,

1054
01:18:42,483 --> 01:18:44,218
So I found
a bunch of bottle caps

1055
01:18:44,251 --> 01:18:46,020
And I glued them on this.

1056
01:18:46,053 --> 01:18:49,023
Very nice.
Is there something
you can tell us

1057
01:18:49,056 --> 01:18:51,092
About these today?

1058
01:18:51,125 --> 01:18:52,927
No.
No?

1059
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:56,430
Uh, is there a reason
you collected them?

1060
01:18:56,463 --> 01:18:58,966
To bring them here.
Why else?

1061
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,236
Well, that's so
resourceful, Sonja.

1062
01:19:02,269 --> 01:19:04,138
Thank you.

1063
01:19:04,171 --> 01:19:09,076
Um, another thing we can do
with bottle caps, if we like,

1064
01:19:09,110 --> 01:19:11,879
Is, uh,
you take one bottle cap,

1065
01:19:11,913 --> 01:19:13,981
And then you collect
some pebbles,

1066
01:19:14,015 --> 01:19:16,383
And you put them
inside the bottle cap,

1067
01:19:16,417 --> 01:19:19,186
And then you get another
bottle cap,

1068
01:19:19,220 --> 01:19:20,788
And you put it on top,

1069
01:19:20,822 --> 01:19:22,523
And then you tape it
all together,

1070
01:19:22,556 --> 01:19:25,860
And, um, it makes
a little tambourine.

1071
01:19:25,893 --> 01:19:27,328
Oh, really?
Yes.

1072
01:19:27,361 --> 01:19:28,930
Well,
then you can have them.

1073
01:19:28,963 --> 01:19:32,299
Well,
thank you very much.

1074
01:19:32,333 --> 01:19:33,534
Okay.

1075
01:19:33,567 --> 01:19:38,172
Um, did anyone else
bring anything today

1076
01:19:38,205 --> 01:19:41,542
That maybe we could learn from
for show and tell?

1077
01:19:41,575 --> 01:19:44,946
Melissa,
do you have anything today?

1078
01:19:44,979 --> 01:19:47,181

1079
01:19:47,214 --> 01:19:49,183
I want to.

1080
01:19:49,216 --> 01:19:51,986
All right.
We have a guest today.

1081
01:19:52,019 --> 01:19:54,488
And he's a friend
of Harriet's

1082
01:19:54,521 --> 01:19:56,824

1083
01:19:56,858 --> 01:19:59,393

are surfers.

Well,
come on up.
