1
00:02:03,445 --> 00:02:05,918
Mister Professor!
Breakfast!

2
00:02:11,148 --> 00:02:14,843
These cigars...
everything smells.

3
00:03:56,671 --> 00:03:58,385
The old man is coming!

4
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,697
Sit down!

5
00:05:21,627 --> 00:05:25,741
Angst! Come here!

6
00:05:33,093 --> 00:05:34,045
Rub that out!

7
00:05:44,648 --> 00:05:46,906
- But, Mister Professor...
- Be quiet! Sit down!

8
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:02,983
Now, let's see
what else you learned.

9
00:06:06,029 --> 00:06:10,941
Hamlet, Act III scene 1.

10
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,027
Edmund!

11
00:06:22,396 --> 00:06:24,944
Na, na, na?

12
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:31,430
To be...?

13
00:06:35,332 --> 00:06:39,150
To be, or not to be.

14
00:06:43,517 --> 00:06:46,866
To be, or not to be...

15
00:06:47,595 --> 00:06:48,881
That is the...

16
00:06:49,503 --> 00:06:50,124
Halt!

17
00:06:50,351 --> 00:06:51,194
Wrong!

18
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:08,618
You are evidently dissatisfied with the
accepted pronunciation of the verb "the"!

19
00:07:10,115 --> 00:07:10,748
The!

20
00:07:11,368 --> 00:07:12,349
The.

21
00:07:12,941 --> 00:07:14,302
The!

22
00:07:15,877 --> 00:07:16,750
The.

23
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,294
The.

24
00:07:22,715 --> 00:07:23,617
The.

25
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:25,834
The.

26
00:07:27,745 --> 00:07:28,846
Say it out loud now.

27
00:07:34,411 --> 00:07:36,186
Goddamn lazy bum!

28
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:37,260
Sit down!

29
00:07:39,681 --> 00:07:40,806
Copy books!

30
00:07:46,512 --> 00:07:51,022
Now, gentlemen, write
the verb 'the'!

31
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:53,774
Two hundred times!

32
00:09:56,691 --> 00:09:57,565
Stempel!

33
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:12,328
Sit down!

34
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:19,577
We will talk about this later!

35
00:11:43,622 --> 00:11:44,241
Inside!

36
00:11:53,971 --> 00:11:55,131
Sit here!

37
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,714
Sit down!

38
00:12:11,027 --> 00:12:15,200
You too!
My best pupil!

39
00:12:15,324 --> 00:12:16,488
Mister Profess..

40
00:12:16,552 --> 00:12:17,277
Quiet!

41
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,596
Look at me!

42
00:12:19,184 --> 00:12:22,443
Where did you get those photos?

43
00:12:22,478 --> 00:12:24,368
I,... I don't know.

44
00:12:24,403 --> 00:12:26,258
Speak in English!

45
00:12:27,087 --> 00:12:28,827
And don't lie to me!

46
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:32,080
Where did you get those photos?

47
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:36,604
Someone must have put them
in my books.

48
00:12:37,403 --> 00:12:42,826
So,.. so, and you want me
to believe that?

49
00:12:50,731 --> 00:12:55,559
At night?
Do not go where at night?

50
00:12:56,479 --> 00:13:01,125
The whole class go every night
to the "Blue Angel".

51
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:04,103
Where?

52
00:13:04,933 --> 00:13:06,171
The "Blue Angel".

53
00:13:08,023 --> 00:13:09,836
"Blue Angel"?

54
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:11,792
"Der Blaue Engel"?

55
00:13:22,542 --> 00:13:25,091
Leave now!
We'll talk later!

56
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,388
Here!

57
00:15:57,383 --> 00:15:59,934
Come here, Lola!
Here's the cash!

58
00:16:04,609 --> 00:16:06,976
<i>Guys, tonight
I'm gonna get a man</i>

59
00:16:07,811 --> 00:16:09,587
<i>A man, a real man</i>

60
00:16:23,348 --> 00:16:27,454
Stop!
Stay where you are!

61
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,177
So, how did you like my bedroom?

62
00:17:37,177 --> 00:17:39,045
So you are...

63
00:17:39,765 --> 00:17:42,207
the artist Lola Lola?

64
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,614
Sorry, you'll have to talk my language...

65
00:17:46,914 --> 00:17:48,100
What?

66
00:17:50,043 --> 00:17:53,620
You are the actress Lola Lola?

67
00:17:54,863 --> 00:17:56,407
Police officer, huh?

68
00:17:56,987 --> 00:18:00,888
But allow me, my name is
Immanuel Rath...

69
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,033
professor
of the local school!

70
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,212
Then you ought to know enough
to take off your hat!

71
00:18:10,063 --> 00:18:14,728
I must ask you to stop undermining
the morals of my class!

72
00:18:14,955 --> 00:18:16,504
So, you have nothing else to do?

73
00:18:50,089 --> 00:18:53,744
After all, professor,
you can't blame the problem, can you?

74
00:18:57,463 --> 00:19:00,730
As a man of honor,
I'd better leave...

75
00:19:00,731 --> 00:19:02,652
I'm compromising you.

76
00:19:05,775 --> 00:19:09,280
If you behave,
you can stay.

77
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:23,745
Catch!

78
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:10,836
Well, professor, how do
you like me now?

79
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:24,174
Ha, hold your horses.

80
00:21:39,366 --> 00:21:42,534
I, huh,...
where's my hat?

81
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:49,648
If you don't want to drink,
can leave!

82
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,536
What fruit are you
hanging out with now?

83
00:21:57,952 --> 00:21:59,300
Professor?

84
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:01,461
Of English and Literature!

85
00:22:01,496 --> 00:22:03,808
Doctor Immanuel Rath!

86
00:22:03,874 --> 00:22:05,285
A real professor.
True professor.

87
00:22:06,463 --> 00:22:08,460
Not a professor like you...

88
00:22:09,647 --> 00:22:12,386
I am delighted to meet one of
the town's eminent personalities.

89
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:17,991
Why didn't you call me?
Am I the manager here or am I not?

90
00:22:21,505 --> 00:22:22,907
Call you why?

91
00:22:25,509 --> 00:22:27,465
Out!
Out to the stage!

92
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,422
Pull up your pants!

93
00:22:52,311 --> 00:22:54,204
Marvelous plan!

94
00:22:59,622 --> 00:23:00,615
How dare you!

95
00:23:01,076 --> 00:23:02,854
I came here to fight for us!

96
00:23:04,857 --> 00:23:05,901
You are harboring my students!

97
00:23:05,902 --> 00:23:07,702
Students?

98
00:23:07,703 --> 00:23:08,589
Yes, you are harboring
my students!

99
00:23:12,928 --> 00:23:17,021
Stop! Stop! Stop!
Stay where you are!

100
00:23:19,325 --> 00:23:21,176
Stop! Stop!

101
00:23:31,168 --> 00:23:33,374
Stop! Stop!

102
00:25:14,639 --> 00:25:16,659
Where did you leave
your hat this time?

103
00:26:37,604 --> 00:26:39,152
Please, sit down.

104
00:28:53,818 --> 00:28:55,469
And he didn't say a thing, huh?

105
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,841
Not a sound.
He's afraid of us.

106
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:00,728
I love you.

107
00:29:01,131 --> 00:29:02,236
Nonsense!

108
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,663
Now he's so sad.

109
00:29:07,783 --> 00:29:09,354
So sad.

110
00:29:11,265 --> 00:29:12,875
You stupid fool!

111
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,098
You ruined the whole number!

112
00:29:23,869 --> 00:29:25,875
Didn't I tell you to keep the kids out?

113
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,149
That'll do.

114
00:29:33,582 --> 00:29:34,410
He's coming!

115
00:29:34,411 --> 00:29:35,411
Who?

116
00:29:35,412 --> 00:29:36,412
The professor!

117
00:29:36,742 --> 00:29:38,901
No, no, gentlemen.
Not through the bar!

118
00:29:39,031 --> 00:29:40,021
Into the basement!

119
00:30:04,849 --> 00:30:07,641
Good evening, Professor!
What a pleasant surprise!

120
00:30:18,854 --> 00:30:20,063
Come in, Professor!

121
00:30:30,174 --> 00:30:31,891
I knew you'd come back.

122
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,415
They always come back to me.

123
00:30:38,207 --> 00:30:41,807
I,... I only need to exchange, huh...

124
00:30:44,516 --> 00:30:46,211
I forgot my hat and...

125
00:30:46,837 --> 00:30:48,794
I must have completely confused it.

126
00:30:57,687 --> 00:30:59,285
And you didn't come on my account?

127
00:31:20,586 --> 00:31:22,064
Please sit down!

128
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:47,384
I hate it the way

129
00:31:53,497 --> 00:31:54,395
Here!

130
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:10,914
How do you like my eyes?

131
00:32:13,309 --> 00:32:14,545
You don't like them, huh?

132
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,908
Oh yes, still... beautiful.

133
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,954
Your temper seems to have improved
since yesterday.

134
00:32:27,452 --> 00:32:29,426
I'm afraid I was
a little, huh,...

135
00:32:29,438 --> 00:32:31,377
...excited

136
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:33,065
Hmm, you had scared me to death!

137
00:32:42,102 --> 00:32:42,987
Pardon!

138
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:53,592
Be careful, Mister Professor,

139
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,042
don't let one over.

140
00:33:08,351 --> 00:33:10,439
Now you're entirely a mess!

141
00:33:12,431 --> 00:33:13,440
Steady!

142
00:33:21,456 --> 00:33:23,149
Come on! Let's go to work!

143
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,551
You know,...

144
00:33:40,239 --> 00:33:44,109
...you know,
you're not at all bad looking...

145
00:33:59,168 --> 00:34:00,817
O, poor baby!

146
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:02,949
Poor baby!

147
00:34:03,467 --> 00:34:06,420
Mama's little pet, oo,...

148
00:34:11,854 --> 00:34:13,127
Did I hurt you?

149
00:34:13,568 --> 00:34:15,108
Nein, euh... No.

150
00:34:15,143 --> 00:34:16,648
Feel a bit better?

151
00:34:16,901 --> 00:34:18,948
Ja, euh... Yes.

152
00:34:21,927 --> 00:34:23,481
Mama's little pet...

153
00:34:45,826 --> 00:34:46,564
Why are there no drinks
being served?

154
00:34:46,923 --> 00:34:47,573
He must be rich enough.

155
00:34:47,574 --> 00:34:49,574
What?

156
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,541
Yes, yes, yes,...
You cannot continue like this.

157
00:34:50,576 --> 00:34:53,599
There's a sailor
out there and his wallet is bursting.

158
00:34:54,103 --> 00:34:55,336
Why are you telling me?

159
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:56,543
Send Guste!

160
00:34:57,988 --> 00:35:00,230
Are you crazy? It's for you!

161
00:35:00,245 --> 00:35:02,315
Nothing doing... I'm an actor!

162
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,410
Not a champagne cooler!

163
00:35:04,558 --> 00:35:07,293
You have to
a conception of your profession.

164
00:35:25,449 --> 00:35:27,238
Good evening!

165
00:35:28,142 --> 00:35:31,385
my dear.

166
00:35:31,695 --> 00:35:34,216
Thomas, captain of the John Thomas.

167
00:35:36,209 --> 00:35:38,728
Just came in form Calcutta.

168
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:47,411
From my cargo!

169
00:35:51,044 --> 00:35:52,533
Leave me alone!

170
00:35:52,534 --> 00:35:53,927
Get out of here!

171
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:56,525
Are you crazy?
He ordered champagne.

172
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,999
But I'm not going to have you...

173
00:36:03,769 --> 00:36:05,651
Uncivilized brute! Get out!

174
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:09,911
Is it your papa?

175
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:14,659
How dare you molest this lady?

176
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:16,967
Do you have a subscription
to "this lady"?

177
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,311
But Professor,...

178
00:36:18,312 --> 00:36:19,824
Silence! Shut up!

179
00:36:20,035 --> 00:36:23,801
I'll take care of this.
Out! Out!

180
00:36:26,931 --> 00:36:28,753
But Professor! Who do
you think you are?

181
00:36:30,628 --> 00:36:31,948
Miserable procurer!

182
00:36:32,295 --> 00:36:33,502
You have no right...

183
00:36:34,085 --> 00:36:36,765
How can you throw out this customer?

184
00:36:36,766 --> 00:36:38,243
This man ordered champagne!

185
00:36:38,278 --> 00:36:40,543
I'll pay for everything!
Get out!

186
00:36:44,317 --> 00:36:47,578
He called me an uncivilized brute.

187
00:36:49,087 --> 00:36:52,698
They want to throw me out of here...!

188
00:36:56,323 --> 00:37:00,046
I only performed my duty.

189
00:37:00,081 --> 00:37:04,188
Now, don't get excited, Professor.
They didn't stay very long.

190
00:37:06,446 --> 00:37:09,094
Here's how...

191
00:37:09,469 --> 00:37:10,580
Cheers!

192
00:37:33,214 --> 00:37:35,348
Excuse me, Professor,
but the police are here.

193
00:37:35,473 --> 00:37:36,570
The police?

194
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:39,848
I think you'd better beat it, Professor.

195
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:53,934
I hope they get along
down there...

196
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,299
The gentleman claims
he was assaulted here.

197
00:38:15,805 --> 00:38:18,323
I can't understand a word.
What did he say?

198
00:38:19,514 --> 00:38:22,065
He claims someone hits somebody.

199
00:38:22,429 --> 00:38:25,191
He wanted to kill me...
kill me!

200
00:38:25,226 --> 00:38:25,964
Who did?

201
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,406
Where is he then?

202
00:38:29,747 --> 00:38:32,846
Where is that rascal?
Disappeared!

203
00:38:33,075 --> 00:38:36,180
Arrest this one, officer.
He attacked me on the stage!

204
00:38:36,641 --> 00:38:39,336
Sure. Leave me alone
with that nonsense.

205
00:38:39,725 --> 00:38:42,097
Where are you hiding,
you rascal?

206
00:38:42,231 --> 00:38:44,979
What is it you want?
You devil!

207
00:38:45,043 --> 00:38:46,720
I wasn't even here.

208
00:39:05,452 --> 00:39:08,369
I've finally got you.

209
00:39:08,961 --> 00:39:11,135
Get out of here!

210
00:39:12,158 --> 00:39:13,900
Your time has come!
Get out of here.

211
00:39:14,192 --> 00:39:15,255
You too!

212
00:39:16,379 --> 00:39:17,261
Brats!

213
00:39:19,188 --> 00:39:20,475
That's him!

214
00:39:21,144 --> 00:39:24,509
He wanted to kill me, officer!
Arrest him!

215
00:39:26,576 --> 00:39:28,144
Excuse me, Professor...

216
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:29,659
He insulted me.

217
00:39:31,591 --> 00:39:34,186
This man wants
to press charges against you.

218
00:39:34,797 --> 00:39:39,065
Very well!
I will press charges, too!

219
00:39:39,075 --> 00:39:42,440
What do you mean,
"press charges"? Arrest him!

220
00:39:42,596 --> 00:39:45,640
- Be quiet!
- Nobody'll make me shut up!

221
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:48,344
We'll see to that.
Off to the police station!

222
00:39:48,739 --> 00:39:50,340
He tried to kill me.

223
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:53,958
" Uncivilized brute", he called me!

224
00:39:55,504 --> 00:39:56,780
I won't put up with this!

225
00:40:06,267 --> 00:40:07,999
I assume you realize

226
00:40:08,112 --> 00:40:11,850
the consequences
of this incident for you.

227
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,732
Take that cigarette
out of your mouth!

228
00:40:26,421 --> 00:40:28,750
Do you hear me?
Away with that cigarette!

229
00:40:31,585 --> 00:40:34,525
Confess!
What did you come here for?

230
00:40:35,578 --> 00:40:37,492
The same as you, Professor.

231
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,761
Get out!

232
00:40:43,115 --> 00:40:45,366
You haven't heard
the last of this!

233
00:40:53,656 --> 00:40:55,516
Fine job, Professor!

234
00:40:56,622 --> 00:40:58,130
Here, have a drink!

235
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:02,330
"Garbage"!

236
00:41:07,551 --> 00:41:09,547
Miserable wretches!

237
00:41:09,846 --> 00:41:14,942
You haven't heard the last of this!
You haven't...

238
00:41:27,585 --> 00:41:29,405
For God's sake,
what's wrong, Professor?

239
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,689
I'll be all right.

240
00:41:36,813 --> 00:41:40,091
I'm better already.

241
00:41:41,263 --> 00:41:44,299
Those hooligans!
You've chosen a fine profession!

242
00:41:44,693 --> 00:41:45,869
You shouldn't get so upset.

243
00:41:55,237 --> 00:41:56,688
Damn that bell!

244
00:41:59,186 --> 00:42:00,625
What's going on here?

245
00:42:01,706 --> 00:42:04,963
The place is half empty already!

246
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,064
Quit complaining!
Who brought the Captain in?

247
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:10,926
All right, get going!

248
00:42:13,196 --> 00:42:15,010
Come on out, Professor.

249
00:42:15,764 --> 00:42:20,188
And listen.
It'll make you feel better.

250
00:42:31,517 --> 00:42:34,309
You gave me quite a punch...

251
00:42:37,237 --> 00:42:42,041
but I'm not the kind
to bear a grudge.

252
00:42:48,948 --> 00:42:55,464
Professor, I'll get you
some special medicine...

253
00:42:56,742 --> 00:42:58,708
from my personal pharmacy.

254
00:43:06,508 --> 00:43:08,016
Put this behind your necktie!

255
00:43:14,661 --> 00:43:17,582
You really think this will help?

256
00:43:17,641 --> 00:43:19,968
Of course! It'll put
some marrow in your bones!

257
00:43:20,128 --> 00:43:21,615
Really?

258
00:43:46,585 --> 00:43:48,194
Was it delicious?

259
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:49,420
Yes.

260
00:43:50,106 --> 00:43:51,723
Now you're presentable again.

261
00:43:53,553 --> 00:43:54,582
Come with me.

262
00:43:54,997 --> 00:43:55,784
Why?

263
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,211
Come out with me.

264
00:43:57,246 --> 00:43:58,323
For which reason?

265
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,922
Don't you want
to hear Lola sing?

266
00:45:03,022 --> 00:45:05,178
Ladies and gentlemen!

267
00:45:05,646 --> 00:45:09,754
It gives me great pleasure to present to you
our guest of honor,

268
00:45:09,887 --> 00:45:11,836
Dr. Immanuel Rath,

269
00:45:12,561 --> 00:45:15,993
Professor of the local high school!

270
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,816
Pleased to meet you, Professor!

271
00:45:53,528 --> 00:45:57,343
Falling in love again

272
00:45:57,604 --> 00:46:00,570
Never wanted to

273
00:46:01,176 --> 00:46:03,789
What's a girl to do?

274
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:06,351
Can't help it...

275
00:46:09,109 --> 00:46:11,678
Love's always been my game

276
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:14,954
play it how I may

277
00:46:16,111 --> 00:46:18,506
I was made that way

278
00:46:19,552 --> 00:46:21,335
Can't help it...

279
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:28,885
Men flutter to me
like moths around a flame

280
00:46:29,807 --> 00:46:35,662
and if their wings burn
I know I'm not to blame

281
00:46:37,272 --> 00:46:40,444
Falling in love again

282
00:46:40,479 --> 00:46:44,202
Never wanted to

283
00:46:49,472 --> 00:46:51,020
I just can't help it...

284
00:46:55,276 --> 00:46:58,630
Falling in love again

285
00:46:58,665 --> 00:47:02,758
Never wanted to

286
00:47:02,881 --> 00:47:03,542
what's a girl to do?

287
00:47:06,592 --> 00:47:08,383
Can't help it.

288
00:47:09,737 --> 00:47:13,589
Love's always been my game

289
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:16,708
play it how I may

290
00:47:17,583 --> 00:47:19,925
I was made that way

291
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,183
Can't help it

292
00:47:24,499 --> 00:47:30,902
Men flutter to me
like moths around a flame

293
00:47:31,767 --> 00:47:37,517
and if their wings burn,
I know I am not to blame

294
00:47:39,162 --> 00:47:43,093
Falling in love again

295
00:47:43,513 --> 00:47:46,572
never wanted to

296
00:47:47,544 --> 00:47:50,283
what's a girl to do?

297
00:47:51,538 --> 00:47:54,907
can't help it...

298
00:48:01,811 --> 00:48:02,762
"DO RIGHT AND FEAR NO ONE"

299
00:48:05,603 --> 00:48:06,254
Professor!

300
00:48:06,461 --> 00:48:07,783
Breakfast!

301
00:49:55,696 --> 00:49:57,708
Morning, Immanuel!

302
00:50:04,544 --> 00:50:08,362
Gute Morgen, huh,...
Good morning.

303
00:50:15,570 --> 00:50:18,222
Breakfast, Professor!

304
00:50:41,765 --> 00:50:43,827
Come on, darling.
The coffee gets cold.

305
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:50,725
Sit down.

306
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,844
Do you always snore, sweetheart?

307
00:51:07,667 --> 00:51:11,738
I think I drank a little bit
too much last night.

308
00:51:11,855 --> 00:51:13,707
Really? I wish I had your capacity...

309
00:51:18,044 --> 00:51:18,982
One?

310
00:51:21,423 --> 00:51:22,549
Two?

311
00:51:24,939 --> 00:51:25,589
Three.

312
00:51:26,355 --> 00:51:29,537
My, my... Sugar daddy...

313
00:51:45,485 --> 00:51:46,538
Good?

314
00:51:47,074 --> 00:51:49,520
Wunderbar... Marvelous!

315
00:51:49,775 --> 00:51:52,149
See? You could have
this every day.

316
00:51:55,348 --> 00:51:56,629
Why not?

317
00:51:58,878 --> 00:52:01,023
I'm still a bachelor.

318
00:52:25,751 --> 00:52:27,271
I have to go to school.

319
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:28,660
What did you say?

320
00:52:28,822 --> 00:52:29,824
The school!

321
00:52:54,058 --> 00:52:55,165
Hold still!

322
00:52:55,691 --> 00:52:56,476
Here you are.

323
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,316
To remember me by...

324
00:53:02,597 --> 00:53:04,544
Aren't you going to say goodbye to me?

325
00:53:07,799 --> 00:53:08,938
Give me a kiss.

326
00:53:10,057 --> 00:53:11,836
Do you love me?
Don't you?

327
00:53:11,864 --> 00:53:13,823
Yes, yes! Sure, sure!
See you!

328
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:27,907
Morning, Professor!

329
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:29,396
Good morning.

330
00:53:59,041 --> 00:53:59,744
Sit down!

331
00:54:19,368 --> 00:54:20,921
Good morning, Professor!

332
00:55:04,511 --> 00:55:09,319
I'll have you all put in jail!
Miserable brats!

333
00:55:13,768 --> 00:55:15,089
Leave the classroom!

334
00:56:39,351 --> 00:56:41,073
I'm sorry, my friend,...

335
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:46,137
...but you've left me no choice.

336
00:56:51,013 --> 00:56:53,734
I must request your resignation.

337
00:58:28,114 --> 00:58:29,199
Hello, Professor!

338
00:58:29,985 --> 00:58:32,935
Don't you have anything to do?
Why did I ever marry you!

339
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:34,808
I've asked that myself.

340
00:58:38,784 --> 00:58:41,888
Why are you standing around?
You know the way now.

341
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:08,990
Hello!

342
00:59:09,165 --> 00:59:11,607
Awfully nice of you to
come and say goodbye!

343
00:59:15,915 --> 00:59:19,703
My dear Miss Lola...

344
00:59:21,002 --> 00:59:26,413
I...

345
00:59:29,131 --> 00:59:31,651
Oh! What beautiful flowers!

346
00:59:32,363 --> 00:59:33,276
Thank you!

347
00:59:53,884 --> 00:59:55,314
Don't be so sad...

348
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:57,385
I'll be back next year.

349
00:59:57,420 --> 00:59:58,473
Young Miss Lola,
if you permit me...

350
01:00:00,987 --> 01:00:03,647
...to offer this too.

351
01:00:12,652 --> 01:00:17,834
And may I also ask you to be my wife?

352
01:00:19,730 --> 01:00:20,692
Wife?

353
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:21,794
Yes.

354
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:38,351
Oh, you're so sweet!

355
01:00:38,532 --> 01:00:43,217
I hope you realize
the importance of this hour.

356
01:01:38,404 --> 01:01:39,877
Ladies and gentlemen!

357
01:01:40,506 --> 01:01:41,856
I will permit myself...

358
01:01:42,794 --> 01:01:45,434
Won't you be quiet
for just five minutes?

359
01:01:45,668 --> 01:01:48,257
Now the tears are going to be turned on.

360
01:01:53,186 --> 01:01:56,664
Exactly like my own wedding.

361
01:01:57,409 --> 01:01:59,981
If I had only had known you then...

362
01:02:00,095 --> 01:02:03,057
instead of this 'magician'...

363
01:02:03,829 --> 01:02:06,904
perhaps I'd be the wife
of a Professor instead of...

364
01:02:08,671 --> 01:02:09,671
Now he's going to

365
01:02:11,374 --> 01:02:12,700
Sit down!
And shut up!

366
01:02:12,921 --> 01:02:15,832
All your wailing won't prevent me
from giving the professor...

367
01:02:15,933 --> 01:02:17,660
a demonstration of my art.

368
01:02:19,755 --> 01:02:21,551
Mister Professor,...

369
01:02:21,674 --> 01:02:23,396
I will now commit myself...

370
01:02:23,796 --> 01:02:26,396
to extract a few eggs
from your nose.

371
01:02:27,289 --> 01:02:29,612
You see I have nothing concealed in my hands!

372
01:02:39,016 --> 01:02:41,806
Attention please, Professor.
Watch me closely.

373
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:03,197
Sweetheart, let me have my suitcase.

374
01:04:14,185 --> 01:04:16,150
You'll never make a living that way.

375
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:37,294
What's this?

376
01:04:38,356 --> 01:04:40,603
Postcards, milord.

377
01:04:40,722 --> 01:04:42,149
Of Mrs. Professor...

378
01:04:42,944 --> 01:04:44,571
We sell them by the carload.

379
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:48,322
As long as I have a penny,

380
01:04:48,975 --> 01:04:51,400
...these postcards will not be sold!

381
01:04:56,745 --> 01:04:58,143
Pick them up anyway.

382
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:01,185
They may get dirty.

383
01:07:08,963 --> 01:07:10,010
How's the business?

384
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:15,782
Two postcards...
Cheap crowd!

385
01:07:17,181 --> 01:07:19,709
Cheap crowd?

386
01:07:20,468 --> 01:07:25,173
He's got dirt.
Let him better take a shave!

387
01:07:28,621 --> 01:07:32,381
You'd better look.
We're not at school!

388
01:07:43,616 --> 01:07:44,996
You can't blame him.

389
01:07:46,911 --> 01:07:48,796
You might get yourself cleaned up.

390
01:07:51,684 --> 01:07:56,388
Anyway, you have no cause
to call the house a cheap crowd.

391
01:07:58,510 --> 01:07:59,828
They give us a living,...

392
01:08:00,307 --> 01:08:01,842
Yeah...

393
01:08:01,875 --> 01:08:03,514
...a living...

394
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:06,013
...a fine living.

395
01:08:07,737 --> 01:08:09,283
If you don't like it,
you can go.

396
01:08:12,656 --> 01:08:17,123
I can go... I can go...
I'm through

397
01:08:20,143 --> 01:08:24,847
I know I'm through!
I can't stand it anymore!

398
01:09:16,072 --> 01:09:17,409
Get me my stockings.

399
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:04,731
Quickly, quick!
My curling iron!

400
01:10:12,763 --> 01:10:13,679
It's too hot!

401
01:11:55,448 --> 01:11:58,742
Well, Professor,
how are we today?

402
01:11:59,431 --> 01:12:00,350
How about a cigar?

403
01:12:01,085 --> 01:12:01,966
Havana...

404
01:12:04,652 --> 01:12:08,495
You seem to be in an especially
good mood today, Director.

405
01:12:08,596 --> 01:12:11,106
I am!
But you should be, too.

406
01:12:11,388 --> 01:12:12,147
Leave him alone.

407
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:13,960
Stop making fun of him!

408
01:12:14,451 --> 01:12:15,152
Be quiet!

409
01:12:15,809 --> 01:12:18,171
Your husband is to become
a big attraction!

410
01:12:19,083 --> 01:12:22,701
Here. Contract.

411
01:12:23,518 --> 01:12:24,543
Settled by wire.

412
01:12:26,262 --> 01:12:26,800
And where?

413
01:12:27,701 --> 01:12:28,813
In the "Blue Angel"!

414
01:12:32,701 --> 01:12:34,885
- "Blue Angel"?
- Yes.

415
01:12:35,243 --> 01:12:38,294
Back to your old hometown.

416
01:12:38,531 --> 01:12:42,007
Think Professor.
Professor Immanuel Rath!

417
01:12:42,146 --> 01:12:45,165
Never!
I won't go back!

418
01:12:45,233 --> 01:12:46,299
You'll change your mind.

419
01:12:46,987 --> 01:12:49,836
I'll never change my mind!

420
01:12:49,911 --> 01:12:50,613
O really?!

421
01:12:50,852 --> 01:12:54,700
For five years you've supported
that good-for-nothing...

422
01:12:55,105 --> 01:12:57,364
and now that he can make a living,

423
01:12:57,551 --> 01:12:58,477
he says no.

424
01:12:58,672 --> 01:13:00,209
Stop it! He'll go.

425
01:13:00,244 --> 01:13:01,677
I won't go!

426
01:13:02,056 --> 01:13:04,910
Tomorrow morning. 9 o'clock.
We leave!

427
01:13:05,103 --> 01:13:09,230
I can't go! I won't go!
I can't go...!

428
01:13:09,687 --> 01:13:10,614
Don't get excited.

429
01:13:11,056 --> 01:13:14,378
No! No!
Do with me what you want...!

430
01:13:15,547 --> 01:13:16,174
That's something I won't do...

431
01:13:17,105 --> 01:13:18,742
You won't have to go...

432
01:13:18,850 --> 01:13:21,310
No! No! No!
I won't go!

433
01:13:21,898 --> 01:13:24,172
I won't go!
Never!

434
01:13:48,744 --> 01:13:50,779
Personal appearance of
Professor Immanuel Rath

435
01:13:56,487 --> 01:13:59,044
Gentlemen!
Please go home quietly!

436
01:13:59,045 --> 01:14:01,030
Everything is sold out!

437
01:15:04,841 --> 01:15:09,130
This is the most important moment of
your whole career.

438
01:15:10,785 --> 01:15:14,352
If everything goes well,
you're a made man!

439
01:15:15,966 --> 01:15:18,364
Gala in Berlin,

440
01:15:18,799 --> 01:15:20,105
perhaps London,

441
01:15:22,389 --> 01:15:22,976
Tinsel!

442
01:15:24,797 --> 01:15:27,011
Hippodrome, New York!

443
01:15:27,323 --> 01:15:28,292
That's enough!

444
01:15:28,577 --> 01:15:31,210
You want to get him all worked up!
We're at the "Blue Angel".

445
01:15:31,302 --> 01:15:32,532
Don't be a killjoy!

446
01:15:32,757 --> 01:15:33,898
And what do you think you're doing?

447
01:15:33,933 --> 01:15:36,918
Do something useful...
Where's the nose?

448
01:15:36,944 --> 01:15:37,411
The nose?

449
01:15:37,698 --> 01:15:38,543
Yes, the nose!

450
01:15:39,538 --> 01:15:40,687
Where did it go?

451
01:15:41,953 --> 01:15:44,784
Chairs... more chairs!

452
01:15:46,121 --> 01:15:48,247
Chairs! Are there any more chairs?

453
01:15:48,535 --> 01:15:49,938
Standing room only!

454
01:15:50,102 --> 01:15:52,250
Don't get excited, Mister Professor!

455
01:15:52,363 --> 01:15:56,356
Don't get excited!
Be calm! Please! Oh, wonderful...

456
01:15:57,859 --> 01:15:59,630
He's right.
Keep cool like I am...

457
01:15:59,740 --> 01:16:01,243
Just don't get excited!

458
01:16:04,108 --> 01:16:06,106
Don't let yourself get nervous!

459
01:16:06,172 --> 01:16:08,214
Just watch me!
You'll be alright!

460
01:16:09,764 --> 01:16:11,020
Great night for you!

461
01:16:11,803 --> 01:16:14,173
Put it over!

462
01:16:33,354 --> 01:16:37,719
When I see a beautiful woman,
it is a moi.

463
01:16:38,632 --> 01:16:42,260
That is my reputation.

464
01:16:45,472 --> 01:16:48,678
What's wrong?
Why the long face?

465
01:16:49,896 --> 01:16:53,009
Every time I feel good
you stage upon the action!

466
01:16:53,540 --> 01:16:56,371
A little domestic affair?
Ahh...!

467
01:16:56,854 --> 01:16:59,927
Don't be sad!
Be like me!

468
01:17:00,349 --> 01:17:05,685
Adelbert Mazeppa,
the strong man.

469
01:17:07,510 --> 01:17:10,108
Better say goodnight,
that's your third cue!

470
01:17:13,517 --> 01:17:19,411
A little drink?
Voilà!

471
01:17:26,211 --> 01:17:29,384
Your husband is very crazy.
He's mad!

472
01:17:51,634 --> 01:17:53,087
Where are you hiding?

473
01:17:54,937 --> 01:17:56,211
What's wrong with you?

474
01:17:56,753 --> 01:17:58,223
Come on stage then!

475
01:18:07,417 --> 01:18:09,945
Lola, come down!

476
01:18:11,725 --> 01:18:13,829
I will not go on!

477
01:18:19,246 --> 01:18:20,140
What's wrong with you now?

478
01:18:21,115 --> 01:18:22,434
You can't cut a month of business!

479
01:18:22,953 --> 01:18:24,860
A minister first class...

480
01:18:28,405 --> 01:18:29,719
What happened to you?

481
01:18:30,076 --> 01:18:31,252
Are you mad?

482
01:18:31,570 --> 01:18:32,575
You've got to go on!

483
01:18:39,973 --> 01:18:41,568
Put on his wig!

484
01:18:44,414 --> 01:18:46,007
What do you say?
You don't want to go on?

485
01:18:46,620 --> 01:18:47,897
- Of course...
- Are you crazy altogether...?

486
01:18:47,898 --> 01:18:50,301
- Leave it to me...
- I won't have any of this stuff...

487
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:52,427
Go out!

488
01:18:52,428 --> 01:18:53,577
And quickly!

489
01:19:12,272 --> 01:19:13,476
Where's the professor?

490
01:19:18,443 --> 01:19:20,244
I can see,
Ladies and gentlemen,

491
01:19:20,702 --> 01:19:23,397
that no further
introduction is necessary...

492
01:19:23,517 --> 01:19:25,852
I will not try your patience any longer...

493
01:19:26,452 --> 01:19:29,849
I have the great honor
to present our beloved

494
01:19:29,884 --> 01:19:31,743
Professor Immanuel Rath!

495
01:19:44,109 --> 01:19:45,379
Come on, come on...!

496
01:20:33,649 --> 01:20:35,219
Ladies and gentlemen,

497
01:20:35,699 --> 01:20:37,760
may I introduce...
August,

498
01:20:38,583 --> 01:20:39,538
my best student!

499
01:20:42,183 --> 01:20:43,530
My dear Ladies and Gentlemen,

500
01:20:43,565 --> 01:20:47,736
You can plainly see that I receive
no external aid whatsoever,

501
01:20:48,155 --> 01:20:51,162
but work only with my two hands,

502
01:20:51,617 --> 01:20:52,945
my ten fingers...

503
01:20:53,332 --> 01:20:56,193
What I now show you,
my dear Ladies and Gentlemen,

504
01:20:57,073 --> 01:20:59,674
...is an ordinary top hat.

505
01:21:00,008 --> 01:21:01,285
without secret door,

506
01:21:02,508 --> 01:21:03,627
without double bottom.

507
01:21:04,178 --> 01:21:06,801
This hat...
my dear Ladies and Gentlemen,

508
01:21:07,241 --> 01:21:10,898
I will now put upon
the head of my August,

509
01:21:11,744 --> 01:21:16,600
and will permit myself to
draw out a living pigeon!

510
01:21:17,696 --> 01:21:19,368
My dear Ladies and Gentlemen,

511
01:21:19,947 --> 01:21:22,382
I know that you think

512
01:21:23,257 --> 01:21:25,762
the magician has already
clipped the pigeon into the hat...

513
01:21:27,064 --> 01:21:30,647
Oh no.
Nothing what you thought.

514
01:21:30,896 --> 01:21:34,689
Please. Empty...

515
01:21:36,156 --> 01:21:39,282
Empty. All empty!

516
01:21:45,784 --> 01:21:47,366
Another proof that the hat is empty...

517
01:21:47,774 --> 01:21:50,038
I have here an ordinary field dagger...

518
01:21:50,358 --> 01:21:51,260
One...

519
01:21:52,137 --> 01:21:53,400
Two...

520
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:55,248
Three...

521
01:21:55,298 --> 01:21:56,451
Four

522
01:22:01,479 --> 01:22:02,696
My dear Ladies and gentlemen,

523
01:22:02,870 --> 01:22:06,399
do not be startled by the gun
what you now see in my right hand.

524
01:22:10,665 --> 01:22:11,506
Hopla!

525
01:22:12,611 --> 01:22:15,835
And now has my August

526
01:22:16,250 --> 01:22:19,182
This is disgusting!
Call the police!

527
01:22:28,997 --> 01:22:32,936
Mr. Sorcerer,
My eggs are all gone...

528
01:22:33,572 --> 01:22:35,485
Would you lay a few for me...?

529
01:22:35,675 --> 01:22:38,458
Why... Of course, Director.
Of course I can. With great pleasure.

530
01:22:38,649 --> 01:22:39,949
My dear Ladies and Gentlemen,

531
01:22:39,984 --> 01:22:44,553
I will now permit myself
to extract a few eggs from the nose of...

532
01:22:51,099 --> 01:22:52,337
...my August.

533
01:22:53,414 --> 01:22:55,369
Gather your wits together, August!

534
01:22:57,085 --> 01:22:58,580
You were once a professor!

535
01:23:01,928 --> 01:23:05,862
Perhaps you're under the impression
that August has the eggs hidden in his hat.

536
01:23:06,238 --> 01:23:07,801
Quite wrong!

537
01:23:12,087 --> 01:23:12,782
Another pigeon...

538
01:23:13,001 --> 01:23:21,199
The eggs!
Where are the eggs?

539
01:23:26,089 --> 01:23:27,847
Very good,
ladies and gentlemen.

540
01:23:28,121 --> 01:23:32,042
at once, our model's
prompt service.

541
01:23:33,092 --> 01:23:36,421
One... two... three...

542
01:23:39,691 --> 01:23:41,045
An egg!

543
01:23:43,276 --> 01:23:44,779
Where's
your "Cock-a-doodle-do"?

544
01:23:45,321 --> 01:23:46,290
An egg!

545
01:23:46,447 --> 01:23:47,809
A good, fresh-laid egg!

546
01:23:49,229 --> 01:23:49,895
Please!

547
01:23:58,516 --> 01:24:02,934
Lay more eggs!
Lay more eggs!

548
01:24:04,994 --> 01:24:06,793
If you don't crow this time,
I'll break you!

549
01:24:07,877 --> 01:24:09,252
Once more.

550
01:24:10,541 --> 01:24:12,164
One... two... three...

551
01:24:12,822 --> 01:24:16,724
An egg! We think it's a real
good, freshly-laid egg!

552
01:24:19,294 --> 01:24:21,158
Crow! "Cock-a-doodle-do"

553
01:24:21,736 --> 01:24:22,739
Your "Cock-a-doodle-do"!

554
01:24:24,124 --> 01:24:25,415
"Cock-a-doodle-do"

555
01:24:25,510 --> 01:24:29,094
I'll break your neck!
"Cock-a-doodle-do"

556
01:24:37,431 --> 01:24:39,056
Cock-a-doodle-do!
You idiot!

557
01:25:33,644 --> 01:25:34,357
Don't you touch me!

558
01:25:34,788 --> 01:25:35,802
I didn't do anything...

559
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:48,073
Get on with your number!
On to the stage...!

560
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:30,220
Was that necessary?

561
01:29:06,886 --> 01:29:10,131
<i>Falling in love again</i>

562
01:29:10,248 --> 01:29:13,437
<i>Never wanted to</i>

563
01:29:13,809 --> 01:29:16,075
<i>What am I to do?</i>

564
01:29:16,911 --> 01:29:18,225
<i>Can't help it...</i>

565
01:29:20,631 --> 01:29:23,846
<i>Love's always been my game</i>

566
01:29:23,928 --> 01:29:26,281
<i>play it how I may</i>

567
01:29:27,739 --> 01:29:29,625
<i>I was made that way</i>

568
01:29:30,219 --> 01:29:31,699
<i>Can't help it...</i>

569
01:29:33,342 --> 01:29:38,885
<i>Men flutter to me
like moths around a flame</i>

570
01:29:39,497 --> 01:29:44,463
<i>and if their wings burn
I know I'm not to blame</i>

571
01:29:45,887 --> 01:29:49,076
<i>Falling in love again</i>

572
01:29:49,272 --> 01:29:52,155
<i>Never wanted to</i>

573
01:29:52,895 --> 01:29:55,788
<i>What am I to do?</i>

574
01:29:56,234 --> 01:29:58,859
<i>Can't help it...</i>

575
01:33:46,578 --> 01:33:53,578
