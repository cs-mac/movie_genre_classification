It's Princess Luna and Princess Celestia.
<SYNC Start=6125><P Class=ENCC>
They're missing!
<SYNC Start=7303><P Class=ENCC>
The Everfree Forest is... invading.
<SYNC Start=10128><P Class=ENCC>
I think I'm starting to get a pretty good idea of who we're up against.
<SYNC Start=14452><P Class=ENCC>
I'm reformed. Don't you remember?
<SYNC Start=16851><P Class=ENCC>
Why don't you ask your zebra friend?
<SYNC Start=19862><P Class=ENCC>
You can turn the potion from purple to white.
<SYNC Start=22615><P Class=ENCC>
You may see why the sky is day and night.
<SYNC Start=26364><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=27097><P Class=ENCC>
Princess Luna!
<SYNC Start=28308><P Class=ENCC>
There can only be one princess in Equestria!
<SYNC Start=31302><P Class=ENCC>
And that princess will be me!

<SYNC Start=101586><P Class=ENCC>
Luna! Think of how long you were <br>banished to the moon!
<SYNC Start=104646><P Class=ENCC>
You'll give us no choice but to send <br>you back there if you don't stop!
<SYNC Start=108382><P Class=ENCC>
Luna, I will not fight you!
<SYNC Start=110808><P Class=ENCC>
You must lower the moon! It is your duty!
<SYNC Start=114391><P Class=ENCC>
Luna?
<SYNC Start=115852><P Class=ENCC>
I am... Nightmare Moon!
<SYNC Start=119805><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=120928><P Class=ENCC>
I have but one royal duty now:
<SYNC Start=123487><P Class=ENCC>
to destroy you!
<SYNC Start=125399><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=128608><P Class=ENCC>
And where do you think you're going?
<SYNC Start=130580><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=148370><P Class=ENCC>
Celestia!
<SYNC Start=149933><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=157975><P Class=ENCC>
No... Why would Luna do this?
<SYNC Start=161376><P Class=ENCC>
Why now?
<SYNC Start=162232><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=163634><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=172478><P Class=ENCC>
You're all right.
<SYNC Start=173497><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=174371><P Class=ENCC>
You're all right!
<SYNC Start=175298><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=177650><P Class=ENCC>
Princess Celestia?
<SYNC Start=179048><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, dear sister. I am sorry,
<SYNC Start=182396><P Class=ENCC>
but you have given me no choice but to use these.
<SYNC Start=186159><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=192170><P Class=ENCC>
Are those the Elements of Harmony?
<SYNC Start=194431><P Class=ENCC>
But that's how they looked in...
<SYNC Start=196309><P Class=ENCC>
the past.
<SYNC Start=197471><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=199383><P Class=ENCC>
This is the night you banished her.
<SYNC Start=201061><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=248271><P Class=ENCC>
Nooooooo!
<SYNC Start=250339><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=266874><P Class=ENCC>
Why are you all looking at me like that?
<SYNC Start=268857><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=269680><P Class=ENCC>
It's just... you were mumblin' to yourself...
<SYNC Start=272322><P Class=ENCC>
Ooh! And don't forget the uncontrollable sobbing!
<SYNC Start=274632><P Class=ENCC>
We were really worried about you.
<SYNC Start=277070><P Class=ENCC>
I for one found it delightful.
<SYNC Start=279667><P Class=ENCC>
Sort of a one-pony theater piece, if you will.
<SYNC Start=281974><P Class=ENCC>
You should really consider taking it on the road.
<SYNC Start=284958><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=286007><P Class=ENCC>
Did you find out whose rump we need to kick...
<SYNC Start=287924><P Class=ENCC>
...and where we can find them?
<SYNC Start=289594><P Class=ENCC>
I saw something from a long time ago.
<SYNC Start=292047><P Class=ENCC>
But it didn't explain what's happening now.
<SYNC Start=294325><P Class=ENCC>
Perhaps farther back still are the answers you seek.
<SYNC Start=298113><P Class=ENCC>
Another sip of the potion will give you a peek.
<SYNC Start=302100><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=302762><P Class=ENCC>
You sure about this?
<SYNC Start=304213><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=311353><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, I do hope she breaks into a song this time!
<SYNC Start=314609><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=326919><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, this is so much fun.
<SYNC Start=330265><P Class=ENCC>
How about a game of 'Pin the Tail on the Pony'?
<SYNC Start=332526><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=335094><P Class=ENCC>
Play time is over for you, Discord.
<SYNC Start=337910><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=338619><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, I doubt that.
<SYNC Start=340388><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=342326><P Class=ENCC>
Hungry?
<SYNC Start=343367><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=346548><P Class=ENCC>
Suit yourselves.
<SYNC Start=347732><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=355080><P Class=ENCC>
Oh! What have you got there?
<SYNC Start=358026><P Class=ENCC>
The Elements of Harmony.
<SYNC Start=360360><P Class=ENCC>
With them, we shall defeat you.
<SYNC Start=362414><P Class=ENCC>
This must be when they turned Discord into stone.
<SYNC Start=364925><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=368312><P Class=ENCC>
You should see yourselves right now.
<SYNC Start=370419><P Class=ENCC>
The expressions on your face. <br>So intense. So sure of yourselves.
<SYNC Start=376261><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=379800><P Class=ENCC>
Hilarious!
<SYNC Start=381187><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=395478><P Class=ENCC>
The Tree of Harmony.
<SYNC Start=396966><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=397670><P Class=ENCC>
The Tree of Harmony?
<SYNC Start=399654><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=406301><P Class=ENCC>
My cutie mark.
<SYNC Start=407976><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=412269><P Class=ENCC>
Are you sure?
<SYNC Start=413618><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=414264><P Class=ENCC>
We have managed to discover <br>the only means by which we can...
<SYNC Start=417177><P Class=ENCC>
...defeat Discord and free the citizens of Equestria.
<SYNC Start=420707><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=421645><P Class=ENCC>
Even without these elements,
<SYNC Start=423196><P Class=ENCC>
the Tree of Harmony will possess a powerful magic.
<SYNC Start=425950><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=431247><P Class=ENCC>
As long as that magic remains,
<SYNC Start=432932><P Class=ENCC>
it will continue to control and <br>contain all that grows here.
<SYNC Start=436657><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=443867><P Class=ENCC>
So what did you find out?
<SYNC Start=445285><P Class=ENCC>
I still don't know what's happened to...
<SYNC Start=447057><P Class=ENCC>
...Princess Luna and Princess Celestia,
<SYNC Start=449136><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=449960><P Class=ENCC>
but I think I know why the Everfree <br>Forest is acting this way.
<SYNC Start=452487><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=453552><P Class=ENCC>
Something's happened to the Tree of Harmony.
<SYNC Start=455236><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=457383><P Class=ENCC>
The tree of what now?
<SYNC Start=458963><P Class=ENCC>
It's where Princess Celestia and <br>Princess Luna found the Elements.
<SYNC Start=462213><P Class=ENCC>
I think it's in danger.
<SYNC Start=463860><P Class=ENCC>
Well, all right then! Let's go save a... tree.
<SYNC Start=468134><P Class=ENCC>
Uh... where is it exactly?
<SYNC Start=470758><P Class=ENCC>
I think it's in... there.
<SYNC Start=473576><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=477078><P Class=ENCC>
Ooh-hoo! I'm going to need more popcorn!
<SYNC Start=480735><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=490754><P Class=ENCC>
Seems like only yesterday we were heading into these...
<SYNC Start=493009><P Class=ENCC>
...woods to find the Elements of Harmony.
<SYNC Start=495240><P Class=ENCC>
Seems like only yesterday I was foolish enough to...
<SYNC Start=497525><P Class=ENCC>
...think I should go after them on my own.
<SYNC Start=499755><P Class=ENCC>
I don't know what we're going to face in there.
<SYNC Start=502504><P Class=ENCC>
But whatever it is, I know we need to face it together.
<SYNC Start=506607><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=514040><P Class=ENCC>
We can use those to cross.
<SYNC Start=515489><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=523749><P Class=ENCC>
A cragadile! Run for your lives!
<SYNC Start=526169><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=545329><P Class=ENCC>
That was close.
<SYNC Start=547352><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=548320><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=548933><P Class=ENCC>
A little too close, if you ask me. <br>You sure you're all right?
<SYNC Start=552380><P Class=ENCC>
I'm fine. I just can't seem to get these new wings to do..
<SYNC Start=555754><P Class=ENCC>
...what I want them to do when I want them to do it.
<SYNC Start=558320><P Class=ENCC>
Aw, you'll figure it out eventually.
<SYNC Start=560598><P Class=ENCC>
"Eventually" isn't soon enough.
<SYNC Start=562648><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=563310><P Class=ENCC>
You have been having an awful lot <br>of trouble with those things.
<SYNC Start=566091><P Class=ENCC>
And, well, who knows what else is gonna to come after us?
<SYNC Start=570086><P Class=ENCC>
You know, maybe it wouldn't be <br>such a bad idea for Twilight...
<SYNC Start=572681><P Class=ENCC>
...to go back to Ponyville and let us look for the Tree of Harmony without her.
<SYNC Start=576251><P Class=ENCC>
What? Why?
<SYNC Start=577970><P Class=ENCC>
For starters, you just about got eaten by a cragadilly.
<SYNC Start=580921><P Class=ENCC>
We all did. He wasn't after just me.
<SYNC Start=583778><P Class=ENCC>
Sure, but... well, the rest of us aren't princesses.
<SYNC Start=588079><P Class=ENCC>
What's that got to do with anything?
<SYNC Start=590130><P Class=ENCC>
Princess Celestia and Princess Luna are gone.
<SYNC Start=593047><P Class=ENCC>
If something happened to you,
<SYNC Start=594728><P Class=ENCC>
I-I just don't think Equestria <br>can risk losing another princess.
<SYNC Start=597743><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=598285><P Class=ENCC>
Applejack does make a valid point.
<SYNC Start=600340><P Class=ENCC>
Even if we manage to save the Tree of Harmony,
<SYNC Start=602589><P Class=ENCC>
it won't necessarily mean Princess Celestia and Princess Luna will return.
<SYNC Start=606122><P Class=ENCC>
Equestria will need somepony to lead in their absence.
<SYNC Start=609329><P Class=ENCC>
But the Tree of Harmony!
<SYNC Start=610996><P Class=ENCC>
I'm the only one who has seen it <br>and knows what it looks like.
<SYNC Start=613779><P Class=ENCC>
Huge tree, cutie marks on the trunk,
<SYNC Start=616017><P Class=ENCC>
probably being attacked by something hideously awful?
<SYNC Start=618710><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah, I'm pretty sure we'll know it when we see it.
<SYNC Start=621690><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=623005><P Class=ENCC>
All of you feel this way? <br>Feel like I shouldn't be here?
<SYNC Start=627024><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=628985><P Class=ENCC>
It is probably for the best.
<SYNC Start=631041><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=641155><P Class=ENCC>
Help! Help!
<SYNC Start=644027><P Class=ENCC>
Discord!
<SYNC Start=645068><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=650112><P Class=ENCC>
You're welcome!
<SYNC Start=651828><P Class=ENCC>
Hmph. No luck finding your tree?
<SYNC Start=655713><P Class=ENCC>
We ran into some trouble.
<SYNC Start=657693><P Class=ENCC>
And my friends decided it would be best if I...
<SYNC Start=659695><P Class=ENCC>
...returned to Ponyville while they continue the search.
<SYNC Start=662024><P Class=ENCC>
Equestria will need me if Princess Celestia and Princess Luna don't return.
<SYNC Start=666194><P Class=ENCC>
I'm just surprised that you agreed to their plan.
<SYNC Start=669024><P Class=ENCC>
I never thought you'd be the kind of pony...
<SYNC Start=670610><P Class=ENCC>
...who would think she was better than everypony else.
<SYNC Start=675146><P Class=ENCC>
I don't think I'm better than anypony!
<SYNC Start=677227><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, well, how silly of me to <br>assume that you would think that.
<SYNC Start=680689><P Class=ENCC>
All you did was choose to keep your precious princess...
<SYNC Start=683970><P Class=ENCC>
...self out of harm's way while your friends thrust themselves right into it.
<SYNC Start=688803><P Class=ENCC>
I'm sure you'll all be the best of <br>pals again when they return from...
<SYNC Start=693442><P Class=ENCC>
...their terrifying yet deeply <br>bonding experience that they're having without you.
<SYNC Start=699364><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=704465><P Class=ENCC>
I never should have agreed to come back here.
<SYNC Start=706358><P Class=ENCC>
Come on, Twilight. Discord may be reformed, but he's not that reformed.
<SYNC Start=710447><P Class=ENCC>
He's just trying to get under your skin.
<SYNC Start=712683><P Class=ENCC>
Well, it's working!
<SYNC Start=714475><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=723290><P Class=ENCC>
Anypony else starting to think this is a lost cause?
<SYNC Start=726235><P Class=ENCC>
We're almost at Celestia and Luna's old castle.
<SYNC Start=729227><P Class=ENCC>
maybe whatever Twilight saw when she took that crazy potion wasn't real.
<SYNC Start=733658><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe there is no Tree of Harmony. Maybe–
<SYNC Start=735701><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe it's right down there.
<SYNC Start=737646><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=738951><P Class=ENCC>
It can't be!
<SYNC Start=740126><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=743887><P Class=ENCC>
How are we supposed to get to it?
<SYNC Start=745912><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=750176><P Class=ENCC>
Take the stairs, silly!
<SYNC Start=752535><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=753982><P Class=ENCC>
Are we there yet?
<SYNC Start=755379><P Class=ENCC>
I don't know where we are. We're lost.
<SYNC Start=758494><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=759334><P Class=ENCC>
I never should have left my friends.
<SYNC Start=761331><P Class=ENCC>
We can't just give up.
<SYNC Start=763399><P Class=ENCC>
Maybe if I get up there, I'll be able to spot 'em.
<SYNC Start=766110><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=770341><P Class=ENCC>
Well, what do you know?
<SYNC Start=772198><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=773347><P Class=ENCC>
Twilight?
<SYNC Start=774126><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=782105><P Class=ENCC>
I think it's dying!
<SYNC Start=783962><P Class=ENCC>
So let's save it already!
<SYNC Start=785890><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=789937><P Class=ENCC>
Nice try.
<SYNC Start=790724><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=795972><P Class=ENCC>
Valiant efforts on both your parts, <br>but the tree remains in jeopardy.
<SYNC Start=799718><P Class=ENCC>
And I suppose you've got a better idea?
<SYNC Start=801699><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=803533><P Class=ENCC>
That's what I thought.
<SYNC Start=804887><P Class=ENCC>
I know who would know what <br>to do. But we sent her home.
<SYNC Start=809106><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=818255><P Class=ENCC>
It was your idea, Applejack!
<SYNC Start=820677><P Class=ENCC>
We all agreed it was the best thing, Rainbow Dash!
<SYNC Start=824856><P Class=ENCC>
We were tryin' to protect her.
<SYNC Start=826543><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=833137><P Class=ENCC>
Twilight! Trouble! Help!
<SYNC Start=835362><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=849529><P Class=ENCC>
Listen here, you rabid rhododendrons!
<SYNC Start=852078><P Class=ENCC>
You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us!
<SYNC Start=854948><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=857541><P Class=ENCC>
Up here!
<SYNC Start=859311><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=862164><P Class=ENCC>
Yoo-hoo! Come and get me!
<SYNC Start=864377><P Class=ENCC>
Don't forget about me!
<SYNC Start=865874><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=873605><P Class=ENCC>
Ta-da!
<SYNC Start=874626><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=882603><P Class=ENCC>
I sure am glad you came looking for us.
<SYNC Start=884766><P Class=ENCC>
Not as glad as I am that you found me.
<SYNC Start=887054><P Class=ENCC>
The truth of it is, Twilight, <br>we're simply lost without you.
<SYNC Start=891350><P Class=ENCC>
Yeah. Equestria may need its princess...
<SYNC Start=894559><P Class=ENCC>
... But we need our friend.
<SYNC Start=897258><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=917584><P Class=ENCC>
Even without these elements,
<SYNC Start=919032><P Class=ENCC>
the Tree of Harmony will possess a powerful magic.
<SYNC Start=922417><P Class=ENCC>
As long as that magic remains,
<SYNC Start=924077><P Class=ENCC>
it will continue to control and <br>contain all that grows here.
<SYNC Start=927821><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=931442><P Class=ENCC>
I know how we can save the tree.
<SYNC Start=933324><P Class=ENCC>
We have to give it the Elements of Harmony.
<SYNC Start=936526><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=937712><P Class=ENCC>
Whoa, whoa, whoa, heh. How are <br>we supposed to protect Equestria?
<SYNC Start=942153><P Class=ENCC>
How are we meant to rein <br>Discord in if we can't use the...
<SYNC Start=944712><P Class=ENCC>
...Elements to turn him back to stone?
<SYNC Start=946809><P Class=ENCC>
Twilight... The Elements of Harmony...
<SYNC Start=948958><P Class=ENCC>
They're what keep us connected no matter what.
<SYNC Start=952045><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=953098><P Class=ENCC>
You're right about one thing, Applejack.
<SYNC Start=954847><P Class=ENCC>
The Elements of Harmony did bring us together.
<SYNC Start=957527><P Class=ENCC>
But it isn't the Elements that will keep us connected.
<SYNC Start=960233><P Class=ENCC>
It's our friendship.
<SYNC Start=961576><P Class=ENCC>
And it's more important and more powerful than any magic.
<SYNC Start=964768><P Class=ENCC>
My new role in Equestria may mean I have to take on new responsibilities,
<SYNC Start=968539><P Class=ENCC>
and our friendships may be tested,
<SYNC Start=970605><P Class=ENCC>
but it will never, ever be broken.
<SYNC Start=973507><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=974581><P Class=ENCC>
There's no time to lose. Everypony ready?
<SYNC Start=976876><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=977819><P Class=ENCC>
Ready!
<SYNC Start=978678><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1035539><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, poo.
<SYNC Start=1037606><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1060719><P Class=ENCC>
We know how difficult it must have been for...
<SYNC Start=1062625><P Class=ENCC>
...you to give up the Elements.
<SYNC Start=1064489><P Class=ENCC>
It took great courage to relinquish them.
<SYNC Start=1066927><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1092339><P Class=ENCC>
What's inside it? How am I supposed to open it?
<SYNC Start=1095367><P Class=ENCC>
Six locks, six keys.
<SYNC Start=1098304><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1100585><P Class=ENCC>
I do not know where they are.
<SYNC Start=1102732><P Class=ENCC>
But I do know that it is a mystery <br>you will not be solving alone.
<SYNC Start=1107238><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1115085><P Class=ENCC>
Bravo, ladies, bravo!
<SYNC Start=1117478><P Class=ENCC>
How ever did you save the day this time?
<SYNC Start=1119745><P Class=ENCC>
Blast the beastie with your magic <br>necklaces, I presume?
<SYNC Start=1123335><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1124549><P Class=ENCC>
Where are those little trinkets of yours?
<SYNC Start=1126586><P Class=ENCC>
You know, the ones you use to send me back to my...
<SYNC Start=1128536><P Class=ENCC>
...extremely uncomfortable stone prison?
<SYNC Start=1131605><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1132296><P Class=ENCC>
Gone.
<SYNC Start=1133292><P Class=ENCC>
Gone?
<SYNC Start=1136251><P Class=ENCC>
But our friendship remains.
<SYNC Start=1138543><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1139458><P Class=ENCC>
And if you want to remain friends,
<SYNC Start=1141268><P Class=ENCC>
you'll stop thinking whatever it...
<SYNC Start=1142812><P Class=ENCC>
...is you're thinking and help us clean up.
<SYNC Start=1144899><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1145912><P Class=ENCC>
Fine. But I don't do windows.
<SYNC Start=1149079><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1150288><P Class=ENCC>
One thing I don't get. Why did all this happen now?
<SYNC Start=1153502><P Class=ENCC>
I have no idea. Those seeds I planted should have sprouted up ages ago.
<SYNC Start=1159129><P Class=ENCC>
What did you say?!
<SYNC Start=1160761><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, why should I try to explain <br>it when you can see for yourself?
<SYNC Start=1165232><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1172639><P Class=ENCC>
Play time is over for you, Discord!
<SYNC Start=1175479><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1176213><P Class=ENCC>
Oh, I doubt that.
<SYNC Start=1178213><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1180028><P Class=ENCC>
Hungry?
<SYNC Start=1181082><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1181812><P Class=ENCC>
Well, obviously things didn't go <br>according to my original plan.
<SYNC Start=1185022><P Class=ENCC>
My plunderseeds should have stolen the magic from the...
<SYNC Start=1187943><P Class=ENCC>
...Tree of Harmony and captured Princess Celestia and...
<SYNC Start=1190820><P Class=ENCC>
...Princess Luna thousands of moons ago.
<SYNC Start=1193780><P Class=ENCC>
Alas, it seems the tree had enough <br>magic to keep the seeds from...
<SYNC Start=1198582><P Class=ENCC>
...growing up big and strong.
<SYNC Start=1201344><P Class=ENCC>
Until now, that is.
<SYNC Start=1203295><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1204712><P Class=ENCC>
You realize this is information we <br>could have used hours ago?!
<SYNC Start=1208383><P Class=ENCC>
And rob you of a valuable lesson about being princess?
<SYNC Start=1212420><P Class=ENCC>
What kind of friend do you think I am?
<SYNC Start=1215064><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
<SYNC Start=1236094><P Class=ENCC>
Citizens of Equestria,
<SYNC Start=1238117><P Class=ENCC>
it is no longer with a heavy heart but with great...
<SYNC Start=1241653><P Class=ENCC>
...joy that I raise the summer sun.
<SYNC Start=1244419><P Class=ENCC>
For this celebration now represents <br>not the defeat of Nightmare Moon,
<SYNC Start=1249449><P Class=ENCC>
but the return of my sister, Princess Luna.
<SYNC Start=1253672><P Class=ENCC>&nbsp;
