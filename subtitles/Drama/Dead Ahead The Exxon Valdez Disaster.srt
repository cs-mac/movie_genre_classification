1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,280
Legend has it that it was written by the Dark Ones.

2
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,800
Necronomicon ex Mortis,

3
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,800
roughly translated, "Book of the Dead".

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,680
The book served as a passageway to the evil worlds beyond..

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,880
It was written long ago.

6
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,000
When the seas ran red with blood.

7
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,000
It was this blood that was used to ink the book.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,080
In the year 1300 AD, the book disappeared.

9
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,880
So what's this place like?

10
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,800
Well it's a little run-down... but, uh, it's right up in the mountains.

11
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,880
Are you sure it's deserted?

12
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,000
Oh yeah... I think so.

13
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,880
So what do you think kid?

14
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,880
I love it Ash.

15
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,880
I feel funny about being here.

16
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,800
What if the people who own this place come home?

17
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,800
They're not gonna come back.

18
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,880
Even if they do we'll tell them the car
broke down or something like that.

19
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,280
With your car, they'd believe it.

20
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Hey, what do you say we have
some champagne hey baby?

21
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Sure.

22
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,200
After all, I'm a man and you're a woman,
at least last time I checked....

23
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,680
Hey! There's a... There's a tape recorder here.

24
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
See what's on it.

25
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,500
This is Professor Raymond Knowby,

26
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,000
Department of Ancient History, log entry number two.

27
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,000
I believe I have made a significant find in the Castle of Candar.

28
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,000
Having journeyed there with my wife Henrietta,

29
00:03:51,174 --> 00:03:53,474
My daughter Annie and associate professor Ed Gecki

30
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,680
It was in the rear chamber of the castle
that we stumbled upon something remarkable.

31
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Morturom Demonto, the "Book of the Dead".

32
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,880
My wife and I brought the book to this cabin where
I could study it undisturbed.

33
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,980
It was here that I began the translations.

34
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,880
The book speaks of a spiritual presence.,

35
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:29,680
A thing of evil that roams
the forests and the dark bowers of man's domain..

36
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,880
It is through the recitation of the book's passages...

37
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:40,000
that this dark spirit is given
license to possess the living.

38
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,480
Included here are the phonetic pronunciations of those passages.

39
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
"Cunda astratta montose

40
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
eargrets gutt

41
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:07,000
nos veratoos canda amantos canda".

42
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,000
It's gone. The sun's driven it away.

43
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,000
Yeah. For now.
Gotta blow out of here for now...

44
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,000
Join us.

45
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,080
Gotta, I gotta get a grip on myself..

46
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,200
How'd the expedition go?

47
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,000
Great. I found the pages of the Book of the Dead.

48
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,800
Yeah, I got your telegram. Thanks.
So what condition are they in?

49
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,000
Take a look.

50
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,080
They haven't aged a day in 3000 years.

51
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,000
Maybe longer.

52
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,080
When do we begin the translations?

53
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,880
Tonight. Is everything all set with my father?

54
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,680
Well, it should be but I haven't spoken with him in a week.

55
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,000
There's no phone in the cabin.

56
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,700
We'll take my car, it'll take us about
an hour to get there.

57
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,600
Annie you hinted in your telegram that your father was onto
something in the first part of his translations.

58
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,080
What has he found in the Book of the Dead?

59
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:07,080
Probably nothing. But just possibly, a doorway to another world?

60
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,080
Dance with me.

61
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,080
Hello lover.

62
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,680
Even now we have your darling Linda's soul.

63
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,000
She suffers in torment.

64
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,080
You're going down. Chainsaw.

65
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,600
Please Ash... please don't hurt me.

66
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,200
You swore- you swore that we'd always be together.

67
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,080
I love you.

68
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,880
Yah! Your lover is mine
and now she burns in hell

69
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,080
Oh yeah, alright... OK.

70
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,000
I'm fine... I'm fine.

71
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:47,880
I don't think so. We just cut up our girlfriend with a chainsaw.

72
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,000
Does that sound fine?

73
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:58,000
You bastards! You dirty bastards!

74
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,280
Give me back my hand!

75
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,400
Give me back my haaaaand!!

76
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,200
Excuse me. Excuse me.

77
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,200
Is this the road to the Knowby cabin?

78
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,200
That's right. And you ain't going there.

79
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,200
And why not?

80
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,280
There must be another way in.

81
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,000
There's gotta be another road or something.

82
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,200
Sure ain't no road.

83
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:31,200
Why the hell do you want to go up there for anyway?

84
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,200
None of your business.

85
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,000
Hey! I just remembered.

86
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,200
Why, yeah... that's right. There is a trail.

87
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,200
You could uh, follow Bobby Joe and me.

88
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,200
Sounds alright to me.

89
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,280
But it'll cost ya.

90
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,200
How much?

91
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:04,200
Forty fi...
Hundred bucks.

92
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,900
Tell ya what, you take my bags and you got a deal.

93
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,200
Sure.

94
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:10,280
Ah. Ah. That's right. Who's laughing now?

95
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,280
Who's laughing now?

96
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,280
Jesus H. Christ... thought all she was talking about

97
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,800
were those two Goddamn little bags.

98
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:29,280
Here's your new home.

99
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,280
Son of a....

100
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,880
Gotcha didn't I you little sucker?!

101
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,280
Old double barrel here...

102
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:17,000
blow your butts to kingdom come. See if we don't...

103
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,000
You little bastard!

104
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,400
You gonna be alright honey?

105
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,080
I-I don't know. I-I think so.

106
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:31,400
You just sit still for a minute.
You know this son of a bitch?

107
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,280
No we thought her father was going to be here.

108
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,400
That's why we decided

109
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,280
Oh my God! Where are my parents?

110
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,400
What the hell did you do to them?

111
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,280
What the hell did you do to them?

112
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,280
Annie, come here.

113
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,280
We'll throw him in there.

114
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,280
Crazy buck's gone blood seeking.

115
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,280
Wait.
I made a mistake.

116
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,400
Wait. Wait. Wait.

117
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,400
I made a mistake.

118
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,280
Damn right. Blackmail son of a bitch.

119
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,400
I hope you rot down there.

120
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:50,900
Oh shit!

121
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,580
I know it hurts baby, but everything's gonna be fine.

122
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,200
Now in about 5 minutes
I'm gonna go fetch the sheriff and bring him

123
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,000
Checked all the other rooms.

124
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,500
Folks aren't here. Maybe they never came.

125
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,100
But these are my father's things.

126
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:15,400
It's only been a few hours since I've translated
and spoken aloud the first of the demon resurrection

127
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:18,400
passages from the Book of the Dead.

128
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,280
Shhh... Listen up. This is my father's voice.

129
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,280
And now I fear that my wife has
become host to a Candarian Demon.

130
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,280
May God forgive me for what I have unleashed unto this earth.

131
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,280
Last night Henrietta tried to...

132
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,200
kill me.

133
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,880
It's now October 1st, 4:33 PM.

134
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,480
Henrietta is dead. I could not bring

135
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:56,800
myself to dismember her corpse.
But I dragged her down the steps...

136
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:04,280
and I buried her. I buried her in the cellar.

137
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:06,380
God help me,

138
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,480
I buried her in the earthen floor of the fruit cellar.

139
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,400
What the hell was that?

140
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,280
Somebody's down there with him.

141
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,079
No, can't be.

142
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,400
Let's get out of here.

143
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:33,280
Someone's in my fruit cellar.
Someone with a fresh soul!

144
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,800
Let me out! There's something down here! Ah!

145
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,000
Let him out!
It's a trick, I know it!

146
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:41,780
Let him out!!

147
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,900
Move it! Open those chains up!

148
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:46,980
Come to me.

149
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,280
Ah! Help! Help! Help me!

150
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:56,100
Come to sweet Henrietta. Ha ha ha.

151
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,400
Hurry!

152
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,400
Help! Help me please!

153
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,400
I'll swallow your soul.

154
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,400
Do something!

155
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,400
There's something out there.

156
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:44,400
That...
that witch in the cellar is only part of it.

157
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:55,000
It lives...
out in those woods, in the dark...

158
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:04,200
something...
something that's come back from the dead.

159
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,900
Plee! Please let's just get the hell out of here!

160
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,780
We're going baby. We're going to get on that trail

161
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,600
Nobody's going out that door, not till daylight.

162
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:11,400
Now you listen to me

163
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:44,600
Remember that song Annie?
I used to sing it to you when you were a baby.

164
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,400
Mother?

165
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:50,400
Unlock these chains. Quickly!

166
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,480
No.

167
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,000
You were born September 2nd, 1962.

168
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:11,400
I remember it well because it was snowing. so strange

169
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,480
it would be snowing in September.

170
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,480
That thing in the cellar is not my mother.

171
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,000
We are the things that were and shall be again.

172
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,400
Steps of the Book.

173
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,400
We want what is yours.

174
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:43,400
Life! Dead by dawn. Dead by dawn.

175
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,480
Dead by dawn. Dead by dawn.

176
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,400
Dead by dawn.

177
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,400
Dead by dawn.

178
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,400
Let me out.

179
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,480
Thirsty son-of-a-bitch.

180
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,480
Where you going? Help us you filthy coward!

181
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,880
We live, we live still!

182
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:29,480
That's funny.

183
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,400
What?

184
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,480
That trail we came in here on?

185
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,800
It just ain't there no more.

186
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:46,400
Like, like the woods just swallowed her up.

187
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,880
It's so quiet.

188
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:04,400
Maybe something trying to force its way into our world.

189
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:43,400
Hell no. You're the curious one.

190
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:10,200
Hey. I'll go with you.

191
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:09,480
Shit. I told you there weren't nothing in here no how.

192
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,480
Holy Mother o' Mercy.

193
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,190
Father?

194
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,480
Annie.

195
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:48,000
There is a dark spirit here that wants to destroy you.

196
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:52,600
Your salvation lies there.

197
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:05,480
In the pages of the book.
Recite the passages.

198
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:17,080
Dispel the evil. Save my soul. And your own lives!

199
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,600
Jake. You're holding my hand too tight.

200
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,600
Baby, I ain't holding your hand.

201
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:57,480
Hey? Where's Bobby Joe?

202
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:53,280
Hey? Where the hell is she?

203
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,600
We gotta go out there and find her.

204
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:12,280
If she went out in those woods, you can forget about her.

205
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:20,600
What's wrong?

206
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,480
Felt like someone just walked over my grave.

207
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:31,480
What's that picture?
What is that?

208
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:38,480
In 1300 AD they called this man the, ah, hero from the sky.

209
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:42,600
He was prophesied to have destroyed the Evil.

210
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:48,600
Didn't do a very good job...  Can you find it?

211
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,480
Here it is, two passages.

212
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,480
Recitation of this first passage..

213
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:07,600
will make this dark spirit manifest itself in the flesh.

214
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:12,480
Why the hell would we want to do that?

215
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:15,180
Recitation of this second passage creates

216
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,880
a kind of rift in time and space.

217
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,480
And the physical manifestation of this

218
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,800
dark spirit can be forced back into the rift.

219
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,480
At least that's the best translation that I can

220
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:35,480
That's right. I'm running the show now.

221
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:39,000
We're going to go out there in
them woods and look for Bobby Joe.

222
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,600
Once we find her we're getting the hell out of here.

223
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:45,880
No you idiot! You'll kill us all.

224
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,600
She's dead by now.

225
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,600
Don't you understand?

226
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:56,000
With these pages, at least we have a chance.

227
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,600
Bunch of mumbo jumbo bullshit.

228
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,600
These pages don't mean squat.

229
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,600
Besides, now you ain't got no choice.

230
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,480
Now move!

231
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,600
Move.

232
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:32,600
Look. You're nuts.

233
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,600
I'll blow your fucken head off.

234
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:35,600
Hey. No trail. Where to now?

235
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:01,680
You'll get us all killed!

236
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,600
Shut up!

237
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:04,680
Leave him alone!

238
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,600
Get outta here...

239
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,600
Where are you, girl?

240
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,600
You're next. Annie!

241
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:46,800
I'm sorry!

242
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:50,200
Get me another room.
Get the axe.

243
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,300
We'll kill it when it comes back.

244
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:54,300
But first, pull this damn thing out of me!

245
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:11,900
I can't breathe, I can't breathe. Hurry!

246
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:15,880
I'm trying! I'm trying!

247
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:30,400
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

248
01:02:56,800 --> 01:02:58,680
Check outside the windows.

249
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:03,680
Check the windows, he's probably right out...

250
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,680
Ahhh! Help me!

251
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:38,600
Oh God! Ahhhhh!

252
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:15,680
No! No wait!

253
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:21,680
Listen to me! I'm alright now.

254
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:23,680
That thing is gone!

255
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:39,000
Damn it! I said I was alright!

256
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:41,680
Are you listening to me?

257
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:47,680
You hear what I'm saying?
I'm alright!

258
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,680
I'm alright.

259
01:05:54,800 --> 01:06:00,280
OK, maybe you are. But for how long?

260
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:07,680
If we're going to beat this thing, we need those pages.

261
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:16,000
Then let's head down into that cellar and carve ourselves a witch.

262
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:06,680
Groovy.

263
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:52,680
Those pages are down there somewhere.

264
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:00,800
"Nos veratos alamemnon conda."

265
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:57,800
Let's go.

266
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:32,800
I'll swallow your soul. I'll swallow your soul.

267
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:27,800
Hey! I'll swallow your soul! I'll swallow your soul!

268
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:32,800
Swallow this.

269
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:05,880
I only completed the first of the passages

270
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,800
and that was to make the Evil a thing of the flesh!

271
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:18,800
Finish it!

272
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:21,200
There's still the second passage.

273
01:15:21,220 --> 01:15:22,380
The one

274
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:29,000
the one to open the rift and send the Evil back!

275
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:32,800
Well start reciting it! Now!

276
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:48,200
Don't look Annie! Finish the passages!
Get rid of it!

277
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:11,800
No!!!

278
01:17:03,780 --> 01:17:07,900
We've won. We've won. Victory is ours.

279
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:44,880
You did it kid.

280
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
By God... No!!!! For God's sake!

281
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,880
How do you stop it?

282
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:35,880
Slay the beast. It is a deadite!

283
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:45,880
Run! Back to the castle!

284
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,280
Hail he who has come from the skies

285
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:27,400
to deliver us from the terrors of the deadites!

286
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Hail! Hail! Hail!

287
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:38,880
No! No!! No!!! No!!!!!!
