1
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,970
Hey, there he is,
at one o'clock!

2
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,470
Let's get behind him!

3
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,480
Yeah.
We'll cut him off!

4
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,210
Get him!
Get him!

5
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,750
About 200 yards!

6
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,650
Clear!

7
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,000
I got it!

8
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,750
Full throttle!

9
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,000
Let it go!
Let it go!

10
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,800
Whoo-hoo!

11
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,300
Hey!

12
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,800
More throttle!
Keep it up!

13
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,900
That's it!

14
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,400
That's it.

15
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,500
[crying]

16
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:22,500
Lay it down! Keep it coming!
Lay it down!

17
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,000
Yeah, fish!

18
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,520
Yeah!

19
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,000
Yeah, fish!

20
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,530
Yeah!

21
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,530
Come on, boy!

22
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,260
Yeah!

23
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,530
Yeah, baby!

24
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,870
Yeah!

25
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:37,200
Yeah, fish!

26
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,700
Yeah!

27
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,500
Go on in there!

28
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,600
Pin it! Pin it!

29
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,000
Closing in!
Close it up!

30
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,450
Yeah!
They got him!

31
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:49,000
Yeah! Go!

32
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,530
He's not getting away!

33
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,900
Keep the others
away from him!

34
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,000
We got him!
We got him!

35
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,200
[crying]

36
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,000
Close it up!

37
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Close it up!
That's it!

38
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,300
[crying]

39
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,000
- Here goes!
- Got it!
- Whoo!

40
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,370
[crying]

41
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,980
Get him
in the middle!

42
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,600
- Go, go, go!
- Yeah!

43
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,000
Keep closin' it up!

44
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,700
Come on!
Come on!

45
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,490
[crying]

46
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,100
[crying]

47
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,100
[crying]

48
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,050
Yeah!
Back up a bit!

49
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,120
All right!
Tighten it up!

50
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,520
Yeah!

51
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:06,650
FREE WILLY

52
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,300
Excuse me. My mom dropped me off
on the way to work,

53
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,500
And she forgot
to give me bus fare.

54
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,300
Could I borrow
some money?

55
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,750
Oh, thanks, lady!
You have a good day.

56
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,400
Thanks a lot!

57
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,500
I really gotta get home, man.

58
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,500
If you could lend me
a just, like, a buck--

59
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,650
Get outta here.

60
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,750
Excuse me, lady.
Excuse me.

61
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,500
My friends and I
are having a problem.

62
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,500
You see, we spent all our money
at the natural history museum,

63
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,850
And we have to take
the ferry home.

64
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,000
Think you could
help me out?

65
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,660
I suppose.

66
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,400
A few bucks.

67
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,400
Shoot!
I'm hungry.

68
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,750
God, man.
I need some food.

69
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,250
Let's go.

70
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,000
Let's go, Jess!

71
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,550
Hey! Hey, you kids!

72
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,900
Come back here!

73
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,400
Ha ha ha!

74
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,230
Oh, cool!

75
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:42,460
Yeah!
Come on, guys.

76
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,900
Wha ha!

77
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:46,630
Whoo!

78
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,800
You know, the first time
I ever went there,

79
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,300
oh!  It was so bad.

80
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,000
My mom dropped me off when
she went to work in Houston.

81
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,600
I never saw her again.

82
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I Don't care.
I hate her anyway.

83
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,250
You know, I could eat
one of these every day.

84
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,720
Yeah,
well, I bolted.

85
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,400
- Oh!  You bolted from Cooperton?
- I did, bonehead.

86
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,850
Yeah, right.

87
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:10,300
Shut up! Bull shit!
What do you know?

88
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,350
I know they watch like you're gonna stick
a knife in their back.

89
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,450
I had to wait till some stupid foster home
losers took me, and then I slipped.

90
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,150
- Maybe you ain't
as smart as us.

91
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,750
- Oh, eat it.
- I am.

92
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,200
I just want
my own place.

93
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,700
Like an apartment
or something.

94
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,700
Yeah, right.
You and me, man,

95
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,200
We'll hook up
with someone.

96
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,600
With my brains and your
wonderful personality, we'll be rich.

97
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,210
Get outta here!
Go, go, go!

98
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:45,500
Let's split up!

99
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,750
- See you, guys!
- All right. Bye!

100
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,200
This way!

101
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Come on!

102
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,000
Go, go, go, man!

103
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,510
Go, man! This way.

104
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,610
Come on, come on!
Come on! Go!

105
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,250
Quick! Go!

106
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,900
Quick, quick, quick!
Move!

107
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,000
- Uhh!
- Down here.

108
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,550
Right here.

109
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,950
Shut it.
Quick, quick, quick!

110
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,000
Check it out, man.

111
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,820
Perry?

112
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,110
Aah!

113
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,750
What is that?

114
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,450
Wow!

115
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,900
Jesse, cops!
Run!

116
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,500
There he is!

117
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,100
Hold it, kid!

118
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,250
Heading up the stairs, Jim!

119
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,650
Hey, kid!

120
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,350
- All right.
- Hold on.

121
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,350
Let go of me!

122
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,400
Relax.

123
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,700
Calm down.

124
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,700
Unhh! Uhh! No!

125
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,620
Breakin' and enterin', malicious mischief,

126
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,660
Vandalism, resisting arrest.

127
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,120
Anything else happen
I should know about?

128
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,000
Yeah, I robbed a few banks.
Is that a problem?

129
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,730
Yeah, I'm glad you were
only out there 3 days, son.

130
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:05,400
Sit down.

131
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,950
Aw, did you miss me,
Dwight?

132
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,000
So was Perry with you
on this number?

133
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,350
Perry who?

134
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,550
Look, don't play.

135
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,300
Don't come in here
being a bonehead.

136
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,700
Now, I hate telephones,

137
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,300
and I spent 45 minutes
on a conference call...

138
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,450
with the police department
and that Adventure Park...

139
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,250
trying to keep you clean, son.

140
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,300
You know what?
We were lucky this time.

141
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,900
I kept you a little
behind out of court.

142
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:28,000
You have to clean up the mess you made
at Northwestern Adventure Park.

143
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,550
Ah, ah,..., ah!  That is your probation.
You got a problem with that?

144
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,400
- Yeah. Why should I have to clean it up?
- You know, I don't know why...

145
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,150
I fool around with
you kids in the first place.

146
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,750
You know, I don't know why
I'm working so much overtime with you.

147
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:41,750
But you split out again here,
and I am out of the picture.  Gone!

148
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,900
You'll be with Youth Authority,
court supervised and controlled.

149
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:50,500
They'll put you in baby jail. That means
a lockup in juvenile hall, son.

150
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,750
Ok, look...

151
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,600
Your placement is still on.
The greenwoods are OK.

152
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,100
They don't even care
about this...incident.

153
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,530
What's wrong with  them?

154
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,750
Oh, I see.

155
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,000
Because they want you in their home, there's
got to be something wrong with them, right?

156
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:14,450
What do you think?

157
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:20,000
I think that on paper you're still real
young, so you get some chances.

158
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:22,950
Not an infinite number of chances,
but a few.

159
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,700
A few, son.

160
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,200
You get it?

161
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:36,750
Ok, you got any questions
about, uh, any of this?

162
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,600
You hear from my mom?

163
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,850
You still want me
to hear from you mom?

164
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,400
I just want to know if she's okay.

165
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:48,150
Nobody's heard from your mom
in six years, Jesse.

166
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,330
Anytime you're ready, big guy.

167
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,650
Hi, Jesse.
Hi, Dwight.

168
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,600
- Hey, how are you doing, Annie?
- Good.  How you doing?

169
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,900
Well, It's kinda been a long day
for the both of us.

170
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,500
- Hello, Dwight.
- Hey.

171
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,900
Hey.
There he is.

172
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,000
- Can I carry your stuff for you?
- No.

173
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:40,530
Well, why don't we go inside and
wash up, and we'll have dinner?

174
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,900
Well, Glen, got a little
paperwork here for you.

175
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,800
Always got to have
the paperwork.

176
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,250
You know, I bought a new car recently.
Man, with the contracts and all, it came to 37 pages.

177
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:59,100
Well, this is a lease.
I ain't buying yet.

178
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,900
- You interested in computers, Jesse?
- No.

179
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,400
- Well, I could teach you.
I just learned last summer myself.
- I'm not into it.

180
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,700
That makes two of us.

181
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,330
Well, I wasn't, either,...

182
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:14,100
but then I decided that I wanted
a second career as a journalist.

183
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,100
I'm a teacher,

184
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:20,000
and so I'm taking
the Summer off to write.

185
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,600
A couple of weeklies have, uh,
taken a couple of my stories.

186
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,650
- I haven't earned anything yet.
- Go ahead!  Just dig right in.

187
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,250
In fact, that's how I know Dwight.
I did a story on Cooperton.

188
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,700
Dwight's a jerk.

189
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,800
So, what exactly
are you into, Jesse?

190
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,800
I'm not into talking
while I'm eating.

191
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,800
Here's your room, Jesse.

192
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:11,800
Our bedroom's downstairs,

193
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,900
buut, uh...

194
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,200
You've got the best view
in the house.

195
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,040
Go ahead. Open it.

196
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,480
It's, uh, kind
of a welcome gift.

197
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:25,480
You can open it
later, if you like.

198
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:30,000
Uh, I--I bought you
some things, some clothes.

199
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,450
Some socks, and, uh,
there's lots of blue.

200
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,400
Dwight said you like blue.

201
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,700
Anyway, uh,
try them on,

202
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:43,500
And... And if you don't like them,
we can exchange them.

203
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,550
Well, I guess we'll get outta here now.

204
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:58,000
If you need us for anything,
we'll be downstairs.

205
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,450
Good night, Jesse.

206
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:02,650
It's great to have you here, Jesse.
Good night.

207
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:47,000
Hey, Jess.  You remember that turn
right before the bridge?  That's 88th Street.

208
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,400
My garage is
straight up from there.

209
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:53,550
If you go 6 more blocks,
you'll be right at the house.

210
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,100
Think you can find it?

211
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,650
When you go inside, you're looking for
the Aquatic Theater. Ask for Randolph.

212
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,990
Yeah. Great.

213
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,700
Hey, mister.

214
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,000
Do you know where
I can find Randolph?

215
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Yeah, he lives in the cottage
right by the water.

216
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,200
Thanks.

217
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,350
Hello?

218
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,100
Randolph?

219
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,200
Randolph?

220
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,900
What's this?

221
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:50,100
Well...

222
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,500
The artist returns.

223
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,000
Well come back.

224
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,000
We've all become great admirers
of your work around here...

225
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,000
...but all good things
must come to an end.

226
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,700
Time to let your
creativity flow backwards.

227
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,450
You know what to do
with all this?

228
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,900
- Yes, I do.
- Good.  See you later.

229
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,800
Wow!

230
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,000
Hey!
Uhh!

231
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:21,500
What are you doing up here?

232
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,430
Nothing.

233
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,000
7,000 pounds, that one.

234
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Jaws powerful enough
to crush bones to oatmeal.

235
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,250
Willy gets into moods.

236
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,650
You gotta give him his space.
You know what I mean?

237
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,300
Don't bother him, he won't bother you.
You understand?

238
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,450
Sure.

239

Yes.

You are looking so beautiful.
How about a kiss?

250
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,800
You should be ashamed
of yourselves.

- I guess.

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,000
You really messed up
our observation area.

259
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:51,450
Sorry.

00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,650
- You like whales?
- I like him.

Well, he doesn't like anybody,
so you be careful around him.

See, Willy's a case.

263
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,900
A very special case.

264
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,500

Yeah.

I like to throw the ball
around once in a while.

Had this mitt ever since
I was in eighth grade.

Yeah, boy, I'm making such a great deal
on you, you wouldn't believe it.

You're
a regular cash cow, kid.

278

That, plus a million dollars, I could
probably retire by the time I'm 300 years old.

Ok?

Dwight says that I'm supposed
to make some rules for you, and....

282
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,450
Problem is, I've always been a better rule-breaker
than a rule-maker myself, and, uh....

283
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,450
So you're gonna have to tell me
what you think you need.

You're askin' me?

Yeah! Well, you're

I haven't thought about it yet.

296
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,650
Well, while you're thinking about it,
I need you in bed every night by 10:00 o'clock.

And up every morning

And I want you in the house
every night by 7:00.

299
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,900
And don't go running
around the neighborhood

00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,650
...and disappearing without
telling somebody.

That's a bad fish.
Good fish, bad fish.

323
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,500
Every day we gotta sort out what Willy can eat
from the cheap crap they buy him.

324
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:46,500
Willy's a killer whale, right?

325
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:47,650
So would he kill us?

326
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,800
No!  Orcas are just hunters.
Mostly they eat fish.

327
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:56,900
Well, sometimes they'll eat
porpoises, squid... birds...

328
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,100
...sharks...

329
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,900
What Willy really
likes is salmon.

330
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,300
That's his chocolate.

331
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:11,450
Kiss me. Kiss me. Kiss me.
Rrr...Rrr...

332
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,750
Ready to get back
to your painting?

333
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:42,250
[music]

334
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:04,300
Aah!

335
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,200
[cough]

336
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:31,350
You saved my life.

337
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:46,650
You must have something special, kid.
That's why Willy didn't eat you up.

338
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,100
- What do you mean?
- Oh, I don't know.

339
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,900
High blood, medicine roots.

340
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,550
- No way.
- Then you're one lucky white boy.

341
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,000
Like the sound
of that better?

342
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,800
Willy doesn't have a problem with me.
We appreciate each other.

343
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,650
Appreciate? Ha.

344
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:03,300
Willy saved your butt.

345
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,900
I don't know why everybody around
here has a big problem with him just because...

346
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:09,100
Willy does not like visitors
in his tank.

347
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,000
What the heck
were you doing there?

348
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:13,000
I came to say good-bye.

349
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:16,250
Job was almost up.

350
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,000
Didn't want to say good-bye.

351
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,000
Well, just maybe...

352
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:24,750
- What?
- Ahh!

353
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,650
Old Indian stuff.

354
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:35,000
Orcas.

355
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:37,900
Ever look into Willy’s eyes?

356
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,350
Those eyes discovered the stars

357
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:44,330
...long before man was even
a whisper on mother earth.

358
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,150
Could look into a man's soul
if they want.

359
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,900
Willy...

360
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:52,650
He won't look at Rae...or me.

361
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,350
Maybe he sees you.

362
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,200
Looks like your parents
are still up.

363
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,900
They're not my parents.

364
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,450
Jesse, where have you been?

365
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:16,550
You're soaked!

366
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,700
I was at work.

367
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,650
You snuck out of the house in the
middle of the night to clean up graffiti?

368
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:23,400
- That's an amazing story.
- I fell in the tank.

369
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,000
The whale tank?

370
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:28,300
Will somebody please tell me
what the heck is going on around here?

371
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,550
I slipped and fell in the tank.
It's my fault.

372
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:33,600
- Oh, right.
- Folks, my name is Randolph.

373
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,800
Randolph, how are you?
I'm Glen. This is my wife Annie.

374
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,000
Hi.

375
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,750
I've been supervising Jesse down at
the park.  He's been doing a really good job.

376
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,300
Did his cleanup, helped out in some
other areas, and made some friends.

377
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,650
The thing is, we could use him for the rest
of the summer, if that's all right with you.

378
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:52,650
Make a job of it.
Pay him a little something, too.

379
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,400
What do you say
to that?

380
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,650
Yeah! Yeah!
I want to, please!

381
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,000
Finally found something
that you're into, huh, Jess?

382
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:04,130
Well, it sounds OK, but days.
No more of this sneaking out at night.

383
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:06,000
All right.
I promise I won't.

384
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,450
Just be straight with us
from now on, all right?

385
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:11,000
If there's something
that you need, just ask us.

386
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,650
Think you can do that?

387
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,350
All right.
It's past your bedtime.

388
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,450
I think you should get in
the house, son.

389
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,650
I'm not your son.

390
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:26,300
Yeah, I know that.

391
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:48,100
[Willy crying out]

392
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,750
- Ok, easy!
- Watch it!  Watch it!

393
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,100
Watch those lines!

394
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,900
[Willy cries out]

395
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,950
Why don't you just
get out of the way?

396
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,650
I'm not in the way.

397
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,000
Look, this examination area
is completely inadequate.

398
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,750
But it's all we've got.

399
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:13,350
Holding him in this net is dangerous.  We've
told you that I don't know how many times.

400
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,850
- Could you finish the exam now?
- No. He's acting up too much.

401
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:19,700
You and Dial bought Willy
from some slimeball whale catcher.

402
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,500
He was too big and too old to be caught
in the first place.

403
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,850
Then you put him
in a dolphin tank, alone.

404
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:27,580
He's not a natural performer,
and you expect me to work miracles?

405
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,750
You're paid to train him,
not analyze him.

406
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:32,700
These are not the circumstances
described when I signed on.

407
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,300
You're a professional, right?
So make it work.

408
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,700
Dial give me a line,
and I am not gonna cross it.

409
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:43,670
This is not about crossing lines.

410
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,900
Which words don't you understand?

411
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,000
Look, if the whale was
to bring in customers...

412
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:50,000
[crying out]

413
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,900
Then we could spend
some money on him.

414
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,300
But since he's not, you're just gonna
have to make do with what you've got.

415
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,650
Easy, Willy!  Easy, son!

416
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:01,850
Untie those back lines!

417
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,650
What's going on?
Randolph, what happened?

418
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:11,650
I don't know.
The net came loose.

419
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,850
I saw what you did.

420
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:23,750
- So?
- So nothing.

421
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,000
I'm sure Willy’s grateful.

422
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,350
The whale's still not performing.
We're getting deeper into this,...

423
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,900
...and Rae keeps saying we have
to expand that tank.

424
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,700
Very nice.
This is what I get...

425
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,500
...for bringing the animal in
to boost business.

426
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:47,750
Why don't we just move him into the
Ritz-Carlton?  I can tack it onto the 5,000...

427
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,900
I just dumped into his
latest insurance premium.

428
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,100
Yeah. The whale's worth
more dead than alive.

429
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,600
It will cost at least 100,000...

430
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,410
...to expand that psychotic
malcontent's playpen.

431
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:03,400
Oh, God,
I hate that whale.

432
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,950
You got any leftover
scraps or anything...

433
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,250
...I could take your hands off?

434
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,540
Might have.

435
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,750
Well, I've got a really
special friend named Willy.

436
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:33,200
Why would he
want scraps?

437
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,550
- Well... He's a whale.
- A whale?

438
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,150
Jess, man.

439
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,000
I'll meet you all up there.

440
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,250
- What's up, man?
 - Perry.

441
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:51,250
New clothes.  New gig?

442
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:53,770
- Staying with some people.
- It's cool.

443
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:56,750
What happened to you that night, man?
I saw you get popped.

444
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:59,500
Not much.
Had to clean up all my mess.

445
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,440
I'm working there now.

446
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,150
They looking for me?

447
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,150
- Nah.
- Cool.

448
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:08,500
Yeah, it's a total drag, man.
Sorry.

449
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,200
No sweat.
Where you been staying?

450
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:12,550
Dayton set me up.

451
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:16,250
Working for him now, looking out
for cops and stuff. You know?

452
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:20,300
I mentioned you to him.
I can hook you up if you want.

453
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,000
I gotta think about that.

454
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,500
Snooze, you lose.

455
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,750
Stop by sometime, huh?

456
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,500
See you around.
I gotta bail.

457
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,650
All right, man.

458
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,650
- See ya.
- Later.

459
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,000
[music]

460
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:19,000
What's the matter, Willy?

461
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,950
Thought you liked these things.
You know?

462
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,450
Well, you know.  You're supposed
to eat it like this.

463
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,000
See?

464
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,290
No?

465
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:42,770
Oh...You want me to put it
in your mouth.

466
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,450
I'll make a deal
with you.

467
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:56,450
Don't bite my hand off, and I'll
give you the fish. Ok?

468
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,900
You like these.

469
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,600
Wow.

470
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,000
You're like... rubbery.

471
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,150
Skin peels off.

472
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,500
Still a beautiful animal, though.

473
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,950
Well, buddy, I gotta go.

474
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,450
We'll save these scraps
and fishes for later.

475
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,650
What, you want
to go with me?

476
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,000
Oh, I can do that, too.

477
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,870
You do it with the other arm?
Yeah?

478
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,000
You do it with the other arm?

479
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,800
Hey!

480
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,200
Hey, can you wave?

481
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,300
Can you dance for me?

482
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,800
Can you groove?

483
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,000
Dance?

484
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,200
Rae.

485
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,350
What?

486
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,600
Can you go in circles?

487
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,000
Hey, look.

488
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,300
Hey. You're really doing it.

489
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,510
Yeah, look at you.

490
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,750
Makes me dizzy.

491
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,080
Looks like Willy’s
got himself a soul mate.

492
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,000
Jess.

493
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Can you feed him?

494
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,750
Sure, I can feed him.

495
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,500
It's easy.

496
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,400
Want a try?

497
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,100
Come on.

498
00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:28,150
Willy and I didn't get off
to a very good start.

499
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:32,450
He thinks I'm the wicked witch or something
'cause of the medical tests I had to do on him.

500
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:38,550
You know, out in the ocean, killer whales
like Willy live in families. pods.

501
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,500
Some of them spend their whole lives with
their moms, and they never leave them.

502
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,000
Never?

503
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,950
Nope. Their social structure is
really important to them.

504
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:48,100
Over 50 orcas have been
seen traveling together.

505
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,450
Some of them stay together forever,
for their whole lives.

506
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,800
You've seen them out there?

507
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,400
Yeah. My dad was in the Navy.

508
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,400
He did sonar research
on whales.

509
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,550
I went out there all the time.

510
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,600
Well, do you do research here?

511
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,400
No. Here, I'm just a trainer, but
I want to work out on the ocean.

512
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,600
I'm going back to school
to get my PhD. in marine biology.

513
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:14,550
But if you do that, Willy will be alone.
And there'll be no one here to take care of him.

514
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:17,950
Well, Charlie's in school, so...

515
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:20,340
Who's Charlie?

516
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:22,240
My boyfriend, Charlie.

517
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:25,150
Do you have
a girlfriend?

518
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:28,550
- What makes you think I want one?
- Just guessing.

519
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:36,600
- This isn't him.
- What?

520
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:38,000
Willy. Right here.

521
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,550
- Sure, it is.
- Willy's fin is flopped over.

522
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,950
That's what happens in captivity.

523
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:44,200
Why?

524
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,330
Nobody knows.  Maybe they need
more room to really swim.

525
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:51,750
Then how come Mr. Dial
won't build Willy a bigger tank?

526
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:55,450
Because Dial thinks he can treat
a wild animals like a commodity.

527
00:44:55,550 --> 00:44:56,950
What's that?

528
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:00,650
Just a big word Dial likes to use.

529
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:08,350
Actually, It means that Dial  won't
build Willy a bigger pool...

530
00:45:08,350 --> 00:45:11,250
...unless he thinks he can make
more money off of him.

531
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,000
How'd you like
to help me with that?

532
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,600
Yeah, sure!

533
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:21,000
Most orcas love to play
around and do tricks.

534
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,600
They like the stimulation.

535
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,800
[snorts]

536
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,900
Can he see me underwater?

537
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,650
Sure, he can.  He can hear you, too,
from anywhere in this whole tank.

538
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:34,900
Now, this, young man,
is a target.

539
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:39,250
Willy's supposed
to respond to it, follow it.

540
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,570
And when we work on tricks or behaviors,
we reward him with fish.

541
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,250
Now, what we’re
gonna try to do is...

542
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:48,100
See if we can get Willy’s nose
to touch the end of this target.

543
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,100
Ok?
Ok.

544
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:51,000
Move out there.

545
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,300
You're doing pretty great.

546
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,850
Thanks.

547
00:45:56,550 --> 00:45:58,000
Thank he with a fish!

548
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:01,850
There you go, Willy.

549
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,800
He likes that fish, doesn't he?

550
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,250
Roll on over.

551
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:14,930
Orcas love to be touched, petted,
hugged, anything like that.

552
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:18,900
Oh, they love to have
their tongue stroked.

553
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:20,100
Wait a minute...

554
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:24,800
You want me to take my hand,
stick it in his mouth, and rub his tongue?

555
00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:26,200
Yeah, eventually.

556
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,700
I don't think so.

557
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,350
You'll learn to read him.
You'll be able to do it.

558
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,950
What's this?

559
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,550
Thought you might want to know
what we're dealing with here.

560
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:41,700
My father
gave it to me.

561
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,450
Thanks.

562
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:44,550
It's Haida.
What?

563
00:46:44,750 --> 00:46:47,150
"Haida" is the name of my people.

564
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,700
300 years ago, there were so many
fish in the water,

565
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,600
...my people only had to spend
one day a week gathering food.

566
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,900
And everybody ate like kings.

567
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:00,850
- What did they do the rest of the time?
- Carved and painted totems,

568
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:04,250
...made music, told stories, made babies.

569
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:07,460
Sounds good to me.

570
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,450
<i>Skaana.</i>

571
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,000
It's the Haida word
for "whale".

572
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,250
Natsaclane was a Haida who lived a long
time ago, before there were orca whales.

573
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:24,200
Hunting fish with the other warriors,
young Natsaclane lost his way

574
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,600
...and found himself all alone.

575
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:29,200
While he was searching,
a fierce storm began.

576
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:32,000
Natsaclane couldn't find
shelter anywhere.

577
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,800
The otters came and took him
way down deep under the water...

578
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,100
...where he was safe
for the night.

579
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:42,200
After the storm, Natsaclane again
searched for the braves.

580
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:45,800
But all he found was a huge log.

581
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:49,300
He began carving
a great beast on the log...

582
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,800
...and tried carrying it to the ocean.

583
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,750
Finally, he found some water,
but it wasn't the ocean.

584
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,300
The great carving sank to the bottom
of this pool and disappeared.

585
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:02,200
Natsaclane sat
and watched and waited...

586
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,750
...and said a prayer
he never heard before.

587
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:07,800
<i>Sa-la-na a-yoong I-asis.</i>

588
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
<i>Sa-la-na a-yoong I-asis.</i>

589
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:14,250
He kept saying this prayer.
It's so weird!

590
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,400
He'd never heard it before.

591
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:20,800
Then it really got crazy, because
the water started flying out,

592
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,950
...and all this commotion
started happening.

593
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:27,600
And out of the water
came the carving.

594
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:29,250
And it wasn't a carving.

595
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:31,250
It was a whale, like Willy.

596
00:48:31,250 --> 00:48:33,950
He flew all the way down
to the ocean, like a bird,

597
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:38,500
...and Natsaclane, he went after him,
down to the beach.

598
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,850
And he got on his back,
and rode him all the way home.

599
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,900
- Isn't that cool?
- That's very cool.

600
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:49,250
- What is this?
- It's an orca, like Willy.

601
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:52,150
Randolph gave it to me.
It's from his tribe.

602
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:53,650
It's beautiful.

603
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,700
Well. You get some rest.
Here.

604
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:09,800
Sweet dreams.

605
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:11,250
Night.

606
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,250
<i>Sa-la-na a-yoong I-asis.</i>

607
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:35,250
Hi, boy.

608
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:36,650
What's up?

609
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:45,200
Hi, buddy.

610
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:47,250
You like that?

611
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,450
Toot-toot-toot-toot-toot

612
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:50,550
You like that?

613
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:53,850
Boo.

614
00:49:56,550 --> 00:49:57,450
Gotcha.

615
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,000
Ho!
Ho!
Ho!

616
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,650
Hey! Hey, kid,
you took my fish!

617
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:09,100
Yeah!

618
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,000
Whoo!

619
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,000
All right!

620
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:13,250
I get your chocolate, buddy.

621
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:33,600
What's the matter?

622
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,900
What are you making
that awful noise for?

623
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:39,600
[crying]

624
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,500
Whoo!

625
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:24,000
- What you got there?
- It's a toy I made for Willy.

626
00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:31,000
Big slap!

627
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,450
One more!
Big slap, Willie!

628
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,250
One more, buddy.

629
00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:37,000
Come on, Willy!

630
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,700
Big circle, buddy, big circle!

631
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:40,750
Big circle!

632
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:43,000
Big circles, buddy.
Big circles!

633
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:55,700
Come here, boy!

634
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,000
Come on!

635
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:04,850
Come on, boy.
Here we go.

636
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,510
Whoo! Yeah!

637
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:19,500
All right!

638
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:35,000
There you go.
There you go.

639
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,850
Double "a" 675434.

640
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:07,800
Hey, Jesse, what's up?

641
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,150
Annie.  Dinner.

642
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:11,200
Oh, terrific.

643
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,850
Hold on
one second.

644
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,750
I need 2 sets of gaskets for that, too.
So, don't forget.

645
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:17,650
Bring them in first thing
in the morning?

646
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,500
All right. Thanks.

647
00:53:20,850 --> 00:53:24,450
Oh, neat car!
Check it out!

648
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:26,200
- You like that car?
- Oh, yeah.

649
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,300
That's a classic.

650
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,900
It was the love
of my life.

651
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:36,000
I spent 1 1/2 years putting that baby
together, getting it in primo condition.

652
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:38,000
And then I had to sell it.

653
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:39,000
Why?

654
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:45,750
Well, simple reason that you can't have
more than one love in your life.

655
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,000
Oh, yeah?

656
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,700
Yeah.

657
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:56,650
You and Annie...

658
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,600
Ever fight?

659
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:03,450
Yeah. We, uh...schedule one
every other month or so.

660
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:06,600
Why?

661
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,800
Just asking.

662
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:16,000
- Oh.  What's this?
- That's a picture of me and my mother.

663
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,350
Long time ago.

664
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:19,100
About your age there.

665
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,450
So where is she now?

666
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:25,120
Well...She died about 2 years ago.

667
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:29,250
Yeah, well, my mom's coming
to get me one of these days.

668
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:31,630
She is?

669
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,800
Not too long from now.

670
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:38,650
Well, that's funny.  That's, uh....
That's not what they said.

671
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,570
You don't believe me, do you?

672
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:48,800
It's not that.  I just...was
under the impression that--

673
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:52,000
I don't care what those people said.
Those people don't know anything!

674
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:57,000
Ok.
Ok.

675
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:03,900
My mom has some things to take care of,
when she's done, she's coming back for me!

676
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:06,800
Jesse?

677
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:15,450
- Hi!
- Hi.

678
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:16,350
What happened?

679
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:17,300
He wasn't at the park.

680
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:19,200
He wasn't? Well, maybe
we should call Dwight.

681
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:20,500
It's after 11:00.

682
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,700
I know what time it is!

683
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,000
I'm sorry.

684
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,500
Jesse?

685
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:28,450
Where have you been?

686
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:31,400
What do you think you're doing?
You weren't at the park.

687
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:33,300
You're supposed to let us know
where you are! Remember?

688
00:55:33,350 --> 00:55:35,450
It doesn't matter.
You want to dump me?

689
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:37,060
Go ahead. I Don't care.
I'm not living here.

690
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:39,200
I'm just staying here for a while.

691
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:46,900
[door slams]

692
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,200
How do you like that?

693
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:50,450
Just when you think you're starting
to get through,

694
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:54,000
...starting to make some sense,
starting to make a connection...

695
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:55,650
Whammo!

696
00:55:55,650 --> 00:55:58,000
Well, he's scared.
He's pushing us away.

697
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,750
I'd like to give him a
push right out the door.

698
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:01,700
Hey, don't say things
like that!

699
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:02,650
What's the matter?
Does that make you angry?

700
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:04,000
Yes, it makes me angry!  It didn't help...

701
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,250
...if you use that tone of voice
the minute he came in the door.

702
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,800
- He's driving me crazy!
- You know why you're really angry?

703
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:09,330
No. Why?

704
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:11,400
You want to know why?
Because you have feelings for him,

705
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:14,200
...and that scares you because
he reminds you of yourself.

706
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:17,400
- Ok. You're right.
- I know I'm right.

707
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,400
I don't like it.  We don't
owe anybody anything, OK?

708
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,210
We tried.  We did the best we could do.
It doesn't have to be any more than that.

709
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,000
What is this, another
one of your crusades?

710
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,550
This is not a crusade, Glen.
We're talking about a human being!

711
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:34,500
Annie, I'm happy,
just you and me.

712
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:45,500
Jesse?

713
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:46,600
Are you OK?

714
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,000
I just got scared.

715
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:02,000
What are you scared about?

716
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:07,250
I dn't know.

717
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,530
I heard you guys fighting.

718
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,110
It scared me.

719
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:22,400
Jesse, adults
argue sometimes.

720
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,350
But that doesn't mean that
anybody's gonna get hurt.

721
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:27,000
I would never hurt Annie

722
00:57:27,100 --> 00:57:28,350
...or you.

723
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:30,600
You should know that.

724
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,250
I know.

725
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,200
I see you opened
your present.

726
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:49,500
Yeah. Thanks.

727
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:54,400
Let's go outside and find the baseball.
What do you say?

728
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:55,650
Ok.

729
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:59,750
Not gonna steal this one, kid.
I should charge you double.

730
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,550
There you go.

731
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:09,450
See you, kid.

732
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:13,300
This is from me to you.
There you go, bud.

733
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:16,450
Got that with all
my pocket money. Enjoy.

734
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:25,000
- Aw, Perry, man!
- What's up, man?

735
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:28,600
What is that?

736
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,100
It's an orca.

737
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:33,250
- Awesome!
- Definitely awesome, man.

738
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:36,300
So...I'm going.

739
00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:38,400
First Sacramento, then L.A.

740
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:42,600
Dayton and I are like...
business partners, you know.

741
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,450
You can get in on it.

742
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,250
Perry, I can't do
that right now.

743
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:56,250
Aw, come on, man!
This is major stuff.

744
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:58,150
We're gonna be rich.

745
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,600
All right, fool,
be that way.

746
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:07,650
Here.
This is where we're going.

747
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:13,450
Look, if you ever get
the guts to go, look me up.

748
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:17,600
Sure.

749
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:20,100
See you, Perry.

750
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:33,900
Hey, Willy.

751
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,500
You miss your family?

752
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,350
Yeah, well,
my mom's a pain.

753
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:45,250
Couldn't take
care of me.

754
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:47,250
Couldn't even take
care of herself.

755
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:50,000
I haven't seen her
since I was a little kid.

756
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,350
But, you know, I still miss her.

757
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,600
Greenwoods, they're OK.

758
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,450
They're OK.

759
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:01,850
You know, it's rough.
I'm nervous with them.

760
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,250
That's just the way it is.

761
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,650
It could be a lot worse.

762
01:00:09,550 --> 01:00:13,000
Really. You understand?

763
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:21,840
I'm sure you miss
your family, too.

764
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:25,850
And I Hope you
find them one day.

765
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,000
I love you, Willy.

766
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:46,150
They're ready inside.

767
01:00:54,170 --> 01:00:56,200
Would you like to do
some tricks today?

768
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,600
Ok.

769
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:09,450
Ohhh!
Don't squirt me!  Go squirt everyone else.

770
01:01:09,450 --> 01:01:11,650
Go squirt them, buddy,
go squirt them.

771
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:25,500
Swimming tail slap!

772
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,000
Hey, all right!

773
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:48,000
Why don't we thank the nice people
for their applause?

774
01:01:49,350 --> 01:01:50,650
Aw, excuse yourself.

775
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:55,500
Thank them.
Thank them.

776
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:57,000
Good boy!

777
01:01:57,100 --> 01:02:00,500
Thank you.
Want to play ball?

778
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:04,200
Yeah?
Yeah, good boy!

779
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,650
Big barrel roll.

780
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:10,800
Good boy!

781
01:02:23,650 --> 01:02:28,200
All right, boy!  Come on, Willy!

782
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:36,500
Go, Willy!
Go on back down!

783
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:46,930
Yeah!

784
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,400
Now come to me!

785
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,300
Willy!

786
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,380
And that, gentlemen,
is our show!

787
01:03:12,490 --> 01:03:13,490
[blows whistle]

788
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:16,460
Yeah!

789
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:21,300
- You did it!  You did it!
- Did you see him?

790
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:26,750
So you can do all that again?

791
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:33,800
What you and Rae want
costs a lot of money.  I have to be sure.

792
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:36,000
Do dogs pee on brick walls?

793
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:40,100
Um, I mean, yes, sir.

794
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:43,000
Sure, we can do it again, anytime.

795
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:52,450
- You set it up.
- Yes.

796
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:57,100
- We may be able to turn this around after all.
- It'll cost us to set up a show.

797
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:59,800
So what?
We let the kid work up a presentation.

It catches on, and we're back
on track, just like we planned.

01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:12,000
It'll make money.

01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,800
And that, my friend,
is what we are all about.

802
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:26,450
You'll have a whale of a time
when you see me at the Willy Show!

803
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:27,650

He's not into this.
Something's wrong.

01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:55,500
Try something simple.
I'll talk.

840
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:58,600
Willy is a 12-year-old adolescent orca.

He is 22 feet long and weighs in

No.

867
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,550
Jesse, that wasn't your fault.
You didn't do anything.

868

Uhh!

I'll hold it and you kick it.

Uhh!

876
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:51,750
Jesse, it takes
a lot of courage
to do what you did,...

877
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:55,000
...to work with an animal
that's so big and strong.

878
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:57,950
Maybe that whale just doesn't want
to be a performer.

879
01:10:57,950 --> 01:10:59,200
Yeah.

880
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:04,000
Look, you gave it your best shot.
You worked real hard, and...

881
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:05,550
...you did everything you could do.

882
01:11:05,550 --> 01:11:07,500
And we're very proud of you.

883
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:12,550
You know, I'd get a little nervous, too,
if I had to do tricks in front of all those people.

884
01:11:12,550 --> 01:11:14,200
Jesse.

885
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:28,400
So what's up?

886
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:31,200
- The show wasn't--
- Screw the show, and screw the Greenwoods.

887
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:35,000
- Oh, now they're against you, too, huh?
- Just like everything else.

888
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:39,150
You know, I don't think you have such
a bad thing with the Greenwoods's schedule.

889
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:42,250
Then you go live there!
I'm sick of this place!

890
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:43,900
I'm going to find my mom.

891
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,350
You mean you're gonna go
hit the streets again.

892
01:11:46,350 --> 01:11:48,800
- No! I'm gonna find my mom.
- Yeah, right!

893
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:52,200
The state can't find your mom.  The federal
government can't find your mom, either.

894
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,800
Yeah, well, I'll find her.

895
01:11:54,100 --> 01:11:55,450
When are you gonna get it, huh?

896
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:57,700
When are you gonna get it...

897
01:11:57,700 --> 01:12:00,130
...and your mom isn't coming back?

898
01:12:00,130 --> 01:12:02,650
Forgot the day she dropped you
on our doorstep?

899
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,350
Forgot about that?
Well, I remember.

900
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:08,000
Turned around and drove away.

901
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,600
Didn't look around, didn't slow down,
didn't even look in the rearview mirror.

902
01:12:12,250 --> 01:12:15,000
That sound like
somebody's mama to you?

903
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:18,500
You got 2 people over here
Who want to be your friend.

904
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:20,500
That's more than your mother ever was.

905
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:24,860
And you could use a friend right now, son.
Because if you go off on your own,...

906
01:12:24,860 --> 01:12:27,700
...you are gonna end up losing big time.
You got that?

907
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:30,000
Dwight, shut up and leave me alone!

I feel sorry for Willy.

Me, too.

912
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:57,650
You know...

913
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,800
Animals can be unpredictable,...

914
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,000
...and they can misbehave sometimes,...

915
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,100
...just like people.

916
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:09,500
But that doesn't mean
you have to lose faith in them.

917
01:13:10,550 --> 01:13:12,550
Right?

918
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:21,300
Well...

919
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:23,740

Go on.
Get outta here.

Yeah, now you want to mess around.

925
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,200
So, what happened today?

926
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:02,600
You choked, didn't you?

927
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:08,500
Quit it.

928
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:12,450
Better stop that.

929
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:15,400
Quit it!

See this?

932
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:37,000
See this, Willy?  It's going bye-bye,
and it's never coming back!

There's a hole
in Willy’s tank.

950
01:18:47,700 --> 01:18:50,400
- They're going to kill Willy!
- Wade was with them?

Yeah, and they drop this.

It's part of the tank.

Dial's trying to collect the insurance money.
Willy's worth a million dollars.

A million dollars?

955

- Randolph!  Let's free him!
- What?

956
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:13,600
Let's free Willy!  We could take him down
to the bay and put himback in the water.

I never liked this job, anyway.

959
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:26,800
So we're putting him
back in the ocean.

960
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:29,650
- You two?
- And you!

961
01:19:29,650 --> 01:19:31,600
- And me?
- That's right, lady.

962
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,350
Just wait a minute.

963
01:19:33,350 --> 01:19:37,300
All I know is Willy’s gonna die if he's dry-docked
too long.  This tank's way beyond repair.

964
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:40,000
He's got a family out there.
I heard them.

965
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:44,400
Don't you get it?
He's homesick. That's why he acts so weird.

966
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,840
- Jesse--
- Rae, they tried to kill him!

967
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:49,900
Hand me that, Jesse.

968
01:19:50,650 --> 01:19:52,000
Randolph, did you call the police?

969
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,400
What good would that do?

970
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:56,500
If we Don't get Willy
into water soon, he's gonna die.

971
01:19:56,650 --> 01:20:00,750
Rae, either get the heck out of here,
or go turn on the number-2 pump.

972
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:42,650
Come on, boy.

973
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:46,000
Come on!  Come on, Willy.
Yes. That's it.

974
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Come on.
Come on, boy.

975
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,400
Jesse!

976
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,600
Jesse, get out of there!

977
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:22,000
Willy!

978
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Come on, Willy!
Come on now!

979
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:31,350
Please, Willy!  We're gonna get you
out of here.  Now, help us a little bit.

980
01:21:31,350 --> 01:21:32,750
Attaboy, Jess.

981
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,500
Please, Willy, please!
Just cooperate!

982
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:37,850
Come forward.

983
01:21:37,850 --> 01:21:39,300
Into the net,
boy.

Good boy!
Good boy!

985
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:45,000
Good boy, Willy.

986
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:03,450
Good boy.

987
01:22:40,150 --> 01:22:41,450
It's gonna be OK, Willy.

988

[Willy snorts]

989
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
It's gonna be
all right.

[moans]

991
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:52,000
Ok, that's good enough.

992
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:54,750
Come on up here.

993
01:23:12,050 --> 01:23:13,750
Bring him on a little bit more.

994
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:19,900
All right, come on.

995
01:23:19,900 --> 01:23:21,460
Nice and slow,
Randolph.

996
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:22,900
Watch his pecs.

997
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:24,750
Come on, boy.

998
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:30,750
You're gonna be OK, buddy.
You're gonna be OK.

999
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,500
How do you think he's doing?

1000
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:35,900
He's all right.

1001
01:23:36,200 --> 01:23:39,200
He's been moved before. As long as
we keep him wet, he's gonna be fine.

1002
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,500
How are we gonna to pull him?

1003
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:58,400
Go! Hurry! Hurry!

I'm hurrying,  I'm hurrying!

No, go! Go! Go!

Hold on one second.

1009
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:23,000
- Just now.
- Jesse's not here.  His things are gone.

1010
01:24:28,700 --> 01:24:30,000
Go take care
of Willy.

1011
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,450
What do you think?
We go straight out to Dawson's Marina?

1012
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:36,500
Yeah. It's the only
ocean access for miles.

1013
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,800
Better stick to the back roads, though.

1014
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:48,000
Jesse, this is Glen.

1015
01:24:48,150 --> 01:24:51,100
If you're there, answer me.

1016

Jesse, this is Glen.
Are you in the truck?

1017

» If you're there, answer me.

1018

» Jesse, please, answer us.

1019

» Jesse, are you there?  Jesse!

1020
01:25:06,600 --> 01:25:09,000
OK. Let's go.

1021
01:25:17,100 --> 01:25:19,000
You're gonna be OK, boy.

1022
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Jess. We won't let anything
happen to him, I promise.

1023
01:25:34,200 --> 01:25:35,450
What do you think?

1024
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:37,600
The Old Forest Road?

1025
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Yeah, that might be
the least conspicuous.

1026
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:44,000
Nobody steals a whale.

1027
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:45,850
But I'm telling you,
the whale is gone.

1028
01:25:45,850 --> 01:25:48,000
The trailer's out of there,
The forklift's been moved.

1029
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,350
That big-mouthed trainer and
the Indian must've done it.

1030
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
- This is a disaster.
- Why?

1031
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,800
Because we don't have theft insurance
on the whale.  That's why.

1032
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,100
Call Wilson. Tell him
to bring his crew down.

1033
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:23,900
You see that?

1034
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:36,000
Oh, no. What are we gonna do?

1035
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:42,200
We'll have to
back it up.

1036
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:57,750
OK.

1037
01:27:00,650 --> 01:27:02,000
Keep going.

1038
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:08,200
It's OK.

1039
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,500
Watch it, Randolph.

1040
01:27:12,750 --> 01:27:14,850
Stop! Randolph, stop!

- Jess, you're OK?
- Yes.

1043
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,250
It's OK, boy.

1044
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:24,100
It's OK.

1045
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:26,500
How's he doing?

1046
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:27,750
I don't know.

1047
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,550
He's pretty scared.

1048
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:36,800
Maybe we should try
taking it forward again.

1049
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,350
If the trailer tilts any further,
we'll lose him, Randolph.

1050
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:45,750
It's OK.

1051
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:48,750

all right.

- Hey, Glen.

- You heard anything about a stolen pickup?
- It's your?

Yup.

- The what?
- The whale?

and I gotta do what's best for him.

and a winch control...

01:46:48,500 --> 01:46:51,000
I'll never let you part...

1283
01:46:51,950 --> 01:46:54,000
For you're always...

1284
01:46:54,300 --> 01:46:58,000
In my heart.

1285
01:47:21,370 --> 01:47:23,140
{{{the end}}}
