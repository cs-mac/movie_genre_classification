the life

I went through
what I could find,

69
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,260
and so I'll just start

70
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,660
from when Larry and I first met,

71
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,580
and this is when he went away

72
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,780
to play A-ball out in Oregon.

73
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,900
Baseball didn't work out,
on account of his drinking,

74
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:56,060

76
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,180
this is, um,
when our son Clay was born.

Mark is in it, the guy who...

but I kept it

93

Thank you, Linda.

Well, this is, uh,

104
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,900
the book that I made
for my daughter Annie.

105
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,500
Most of the pictures
have my son Walter in them

106
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,940

107

they're twins, and...

108
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,100
Walter came
along with me today

109
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,900
because
I asked him to.

110

He didn't want to come.

111

Anyway, um...

112

Annie came first,

and Walter came
eight minutes later.

It was one of the few times
Walter came in second,

There is simply
no direct evidence

132
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,740
connecting Tom Friedinger
to the murder of Annie Blount.

133
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:55,980
There's no forensic evidence.

134
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,260
There's no witnesses

communication with the decedent

137
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,020
an hour before
she was abducted and killed.

138
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,420
Yes, he liked to
walk her home at night,

139
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,780
particularly when she was drunk,
which she was that night.

140
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,820
Yes, he gave her presents
and wrote her letters

141
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,420
and sent her flowers,

142
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,300
but that does not mean
that he attacked her that night.

143
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:20,660
Strong feelings
for the victim

144
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:23,380
are not enough evidence
upon which to proceed!

145
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,780
Uh, particularly when
you take into account

146
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,220
Miss Blount's
lifestyle,

147
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,580
and the number of men

in the last few years alone!

You're not helping us
in there.

173

The way you sit
in that gallery

00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,660
and glare
at Friedinger

175
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:11,780
makes Friedinger seem
even more sympathetic

176
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,980
than he already is.

177
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,700
Sympathetic?

178
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,460
Walter, he's a fat slob
with a low I.Q.

179
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:19,740
Who's never caught a break
in his life,

180
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,900
and you know
as well as I do

181
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,220
the evidence we've got

182
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,300
isn't exactly
going to fry him

183
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,300
without the jury
on our side.

184
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,700
Come to court,
just...

185
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,980

you know?

186
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:30,980
So, Mrs. Pietrysk...

187
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,060
Hi.

188
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,180
Let some steam off
before you come in.

189
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,140
Jury selection
will take

the better part
of the week.

191
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,900
Each side

to rule out

00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,980
any potential
problem jurors.

194
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,220
We'll get the right
people up there,

195
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,100
and we'll
start this thing.

196
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,100
Okay.

197
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,340
Okay?

198
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,420
Hi.

199
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,060
You're Gloria's son,
right?

200
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,380
Yeah.
Walter.

201
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,740
Walter, right.

00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,620
Oh, God...

you can't smoke

I'm here for
jury selection.

00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,860
I heard
it can take a while.

206
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,140
That's what the prosecutor
was just telling me.

207
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:18,460
There's a snack machine
on the second floor,

208
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,220
in case you get hungry.

209
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,340
Thanks.

Oh, please.
Fuck off.

222
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,140
Most survivors turn
to the criminal justice system

223
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,740
for a kind of emotional support

224

in their need to see
their loved one's assailants

00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,100
apprehended, prosecuted,

226
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,740
convicted, and punished.

227
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,820
Unfortunately,

228
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,980
the criminal
justice system

229
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,420
exists for society,

230
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,140
not for you
as an individual.

231
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,220
So whatever you believe

232
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,420
the appropriate punishment
for the murder is

233
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,300
will probably not
be doled out.

234
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,540
Even if the killer
gets the death sentence,

235
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:08,580
it ultimately will not
make you feel better.

236
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:14,460
Okay, that does it
for today.

237
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,100
Remember,
we set a date

for the charity
rummage sale,

239
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,300
and this should be
a great way

240
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,740
to let go of
those possessions

241

you've struggled
to get rid of,

as well as a good way
to raise money

243
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,940
for victims' families.

244
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,780
Good stuff.

245

Judge Wettick rejected
the defense's motions to dismiss

So, we're back to it.

I don't wish

a lot.

251
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,020
She was promiscuous.

252
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,700
She had sexual relations
with many men.

253
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,620
Consequently,

254
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,700
it gave many men
reason to react to her.

[quietly]:
That's not true...

256
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,740
She was a person

257
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,980
who put herself
into dangerous situations

with great frequency.

259
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,340
That's not true.

260
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:09,420
It has been established
in this court of law

261
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,060
that Miss Blount
was not even certain

This defense attorney
basically

00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,860
just called
my sister a wh...

Whore.

281
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:08,460
Oh, that's
not right.

282
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,620
Basically said

283
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,980
she brought it
on herself.

I'm sorry.

285
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:29,500
It's not enough that
he represents that...

286
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,260
that human
piece of crap,

287
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,860
but to call
my sister's honor

288
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:37,620
into question?

289
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,980
I wonder
what would happen

290
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,940
if we waited outside
for him later today

291
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:55,300
and beat the living shit
out of him.

292
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,220
I'd never even
been to court

293
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,900
before all of this
happened.

It's like a...

00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,300
It's like a foreign
country in there.

296
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:14,260
The words they use
and how things happen,

297
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,140
it's-- it's...

298
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,460
it's like I got
on the wrong plane

299
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:20,020
and got off in some

You don't talk much,
do you?

302
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,740
I don't know.

303
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,100
Well, so,
what were you doing

Wrestling?

307
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,260
Yeah, um,
I was in Iowa,

308

training with
the national team,

309
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,100
and then...

310
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,220
it happens,
and I came home,

311
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,780
and I stayed.

312
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,020
How old are you?

stay around here.

00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,660
Well, you were kind of just
staring at me.

331
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,900
[chuckles]

332
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,020
I'm not very good at it.

333
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,260
The other guy
who wears the suit,

334
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,220
Jose, he, like,
dances...

335
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,460
Right.

336
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,700
And flaps his arms
and stuff.

337
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,740
Right, right, right.

338
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,700
Oh, you're the one
who sits on the...

339
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,500
the edge of the window.

340
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,300
The sad chicken.

341
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,340
[sighs]

342
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,620
Well, I work over
at the community center.

343
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,780
I oversee the special events,
mostly weddings.

344
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,820
I started doing it
after Larry was killed.

345
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,380
I was just kind of

346
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:43,500
walking around
in a haze, and...

347
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,860
anyway, my girlfriend,

348
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,180
she's head of human resources
over there,

349
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,300
so, you know, that's...

350
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:55,500
that's how
I got hired.

351
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,940
Do you like it?

352
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,060
The job?

353
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,180
They don't make me wear
a chicken suit.

354
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,460
No.

355
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,140
Oh, wrestling.

356
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:17,260
Right.

357
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:21,380

Jesus, Walter.

374

What the hell
are you doing?

375
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,260
I got it.

376
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,780
Jesus Christ, Walter,
what the hell are you doing

377
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,220
pushing all that
weight around alone?

378

[sighs heavily]

379
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,260
Oh, uh, I made
an extra key for you

380
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,820
for the weight room.

381
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:04,300
Lock up
when you go.

382
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,500
Thank you.

383
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,540
Are you, uh...

384
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,860
you entering
the regional tournament?

385
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,300
No.

00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,180
What?

387
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,220
I'm not wrestling
anymore, coach.

388
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,380
What the hell

389
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:17,460
are you training
so hard for?

Come on, you too cool, buddy?

You can't talk to me?

00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,740
Want to run with me,
tough guy?

402
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,380
Want to run with me?

403
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,340
You too cool to talk
to me, big guy?

404
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,380
Come on, guy,
let's go!

405
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,180
You ride the cart into school
this morning?

406
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,940
In the back
of the yellow twinkie bus?

407

Come on, tough guy.

408

[almost inaudible]:
Come on, retard, do something.

409
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,940
Don't just stand there.

410
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,020
You got to talk
to me first, tough guy.

411
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,660
What's up?
Do something.

412
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:05,980
Let's go, retard.

413
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,060
Are you going to
fight me or not?

414
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,340
What, you can't
hear me?

415
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:09,660
What are you,
deaf or something?

416
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,700
Let's go, buddy.

417
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,700
Do something.

418
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,980

You hear what I'm saying to you?

if you want to fight me or not--

421

Hey!

422
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,180
"Special" my ass.

423
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,620
Hey, leave him
alone!

[crowd gasps]

425
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,140

You all right, man?

You all right?

429
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,340
All right,
take it easy.

430
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,460
Hey, he sucker-punched me!

431
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,980
Take it easy.

432
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,380
Hey...

00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,420
Hey!

434
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,460
I'm Walter.

435
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,940
I know your mother.

436
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,300
Give me the gun.

437
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,900
I'm serious.
Give it to me.

438
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:28,220
The gun.

439
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:34,020
Give me the gun.

440
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:41,980
Fucking pulled a gun
on me, the freak!

[muffled]: Kid starts kind of
shoving him and whatnot.

442
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,700
He put a pretty good
lickin' on him.

443
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:11,940
He, uh,
pulled out a gun.

444
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,300
Shit!

445
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,460
Shit...

[sighs]

447
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,260
I have to talk to him
for a second.

448
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,540
Will you hang around?

449
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,740
[muffled shouts from basement]

450
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,420
Are you--

451
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,300
No, you can't
have the gun back!

452
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,860
I know!

453
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:20,060
Look at me!

454
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,100
I know.

455
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:25,740
I know those kids
were teasing you.

456
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,180
Clay, you can't--

457
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,180
Clay, look--

458
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:35,060
Clay...

459
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:43,300
Would you mind
not doing that?

460
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,980
Why has he got a gun?

461
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:59,900
[sighs]

462
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,340
It was his father's.

463
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,460
No, what's he doing with it?

464
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,380
I'm not stupid, Walter.

465
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,140
I didn't give him bullets
or anything.

466
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,380
Forget it.
I'll take it away.

467
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,980
I have to now.

468
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,660
If he gets kicked out
of another school,

469
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,980
Fuck!

470
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,340
God, and the trial is starting,

471
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:21,740
and I don't know
what I'm going to do with him.

472
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:28,140
I have to
deal with this now, so...

473
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,500
[gun thuds on table]

474
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,620
Yeah.

475
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,020
Your mom told me you were
coming home soon,

476
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:13,420
so I just waited.

477
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,620
You want to go
get a beer

478
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,900
or something?

479
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:20,020
I'm not drinking.

480
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,180
I could probably
help you get a job

481
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,420
over where I'm working

482
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,460
if you wanted to,
you know,

483
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:29,460
Do something
indoors, or...

484
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:31,580
I'm okay.

485
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,220
I told you

486
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,620
about that girl
I was seeing, right?

487
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,660
Uh, yeah.

488
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,260
Grace.

489
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:41,100
She's pregnant.

490
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,940
I'm going to ask her
to marry me.

491
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,220
Okay.

492
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:54,700
And I wanted to know if,
you know,

493
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:57,500
maybe you could talk to your mom
about Annie's ring?

494
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,460
You know,
I didn't want to just...

495
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:04,780
I just thought it might
upset her, coming from me.

496
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,260
You know, and I can't afford
to buy another one.

497
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,220
But, I mean, if she
freaks out or something,

498
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:13,500
I understand.
It's cool.

499
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:35,220
[#]

500
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,580
I'm going to sell
Annie's record collection

501
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,620
in the rummage sale,

502
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,780
unless you want 'em.

503
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,780
Have you seen
my yellow sweatshirt?

504
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,020
Check the wash.

505
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,180
Which--
this wash?

506
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,540
Great, Ma.

507
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,140
Oh.

508
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,980
I let Beth help
with the laundry.

509
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:34,260
Well, now I've got to
go to the store

510
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,540
and buy another one
before work.

511
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,500
Why?

512
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,780
Because chickens
are yellow, Ma,

513
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,060
Not pink!

514
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:44,220
Maybe it's time you thought
about going back to Iowa.

515
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:48,460
Honey, Annie wouldn't want it
this way.

516
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,620
What way?

517
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:54,900
Well, you in a chicken suit
outside the Megabird, for one.

518
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:57,020
And you sitting
in that courtroom all day,

519
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:02,460
staring at Peggy Friedinger's
half-retarded son.

520
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:04,340
How would Annie
want it, Ma?

521
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,860
She'd probably
want you to be...

522
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,580
I don't know,
doing what you used to do

523
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,260
the way you used to do it.

524
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,380
Am I embarrassing you?

525
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,540
No, Honey.

526
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,060
You know what
Annie would want?

527
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,820
Annie would want it
to be made right.

528
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:20,700
She'd want it
to be fair.

529
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:25,620
I can fix you some eggs
or something.

530
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,020
By the way,
Brice stopped by.

531
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,500
He wants
Annie's ring back.

532
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,500
Oh?

533
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,660
Yeah, he got
some girl pregnant,

534
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,900
and now he wants to
give her Annie's ring.

535
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:36,860
Oh.

536
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:42,020
It's up in Beth's room,
in the dresser drawer.

537
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,580
What are you doing?

538
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,460
Nothing.

539
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,660
What are
you doing?

540
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,980
Grammy says I can stay home
from school today.

541
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,820
What are you going to do
instead?

542
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:02,980
Is that you, Walter?

543
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,140
Yeah.

544
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,140
Hi.

545
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,780
Hi.

546
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,300
Listen...

547
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:11,180
I just wanted
to come by, and...

548
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,660
Can you...

549
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,620
can you take off
that damn mask, please?

550
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,500
Yeah.

551
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,460
Thanks.

552
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,980
You know it's raining out.

553
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,020
Yeah.

554
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,700
And they make you
stand out here in the rain?

555
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,940
Yeah.

556
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,700
Want to get a coffee?

557
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,540
I don't
drink coffee.

558
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,660
I'll watch you
drink coffee.

559
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,060
Okay.

560
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:47,540
Just, I need
one second.

561
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:55,980
I just want to thank you
for helping Clay.

562
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:03,740
I'm afraid I...

563
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,260
I was bitchy.

564
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,100
So, anyway,
thanks.

565
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,220
What's going to happen with him?

566
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:22,140
Oh, the city put him
in this program.

567
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,580
What program?

568
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,020
Some genius
in the Mayor's office thinks

569
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,500
if you send a kid
to the coroner's office

570
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,980
and watch autopsies
on gunshot deaths

571
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,540
it'll change
his life.

572
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,900
Autopsies?

573
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,860
And this is a kid--

574
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,060
I mean, his father
was shot to death.

575
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,900
Listen,

576
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,500
I'm doing this wedding
Saturday night,

577
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:52,140
and I'm allowed to
bring someone...

578
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,460
Okay.

579
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,580
And it's not like
a date or anything,

580
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,660
I just need someone
to come with me.

581
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,660
Because I cr...

582
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,660
[laughs]

583
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:10,140
I cry too much at the weddings,

584
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,700
and I...

585
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,620
I just can't seem
to stop it,

586
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,740
and I just--
I think about Larry,

587
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:18,460
and I-- and I lose it, and...

588
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:21,340
anyway, so my friend is saying

589
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:25,620
maybe I shouldn't do it anymore
if I can't control my emotions,

590
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,460
so I was thinking, well,

591
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,260
maybe if I had
someone with me...

592
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,660
[sighing]

593
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:36,860
I wouldn't feel
so sorry for myself.

594
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:43,100
You know, if you want to come.

595
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:52,340
[#]

596

00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,300
Mom!

604
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,340
Oh...

605
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,620
Out.

606
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:44,380
I have to get dressed.

607
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,980
Out.

608
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,980
Hi, Walter.

609
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,420
Hey.

610
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,500
You look nice.

611
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,980
Thank you.

612
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,060
That's...
You...

613
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,060
Oh.

614
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,580
Is this weird?

615
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,620
Going to a wedding

616
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:17,020
where you don't
know anybody?

617
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,380
I guess.

618
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,780
I...

619
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,260
I just feel
kind of stupid

620
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,860
asking for
your help now.

621
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:26,140
It's okay.

622
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:29,580
I was just going to
watch TV,

623
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:32,340
so...

624
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,860
Okay.

625
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:35,860
So...

626
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:37,740
Okay.

627
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,780
Thank you.

628
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,020
So, this wedding
we're going to...

629
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,020
Yeah?

630
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,460
It's a beautiful
story, really.

631
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,340
Um, they met
in their church choir,

632
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,180
and, um, well,
her father is dead,

633
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,500
but was military,

634
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,500
and her uncle
is walking her

635
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:56,780
down the aisle,

636
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,180
and the flag

637
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,500
that was over
her father's coffin

638
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,460
is going to be placed
in an empty seat

639
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,580
in the front row.

640
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,380
Oh, and then
the bride and groom

641
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,060
are going to sing
to each other, and...

642
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:09,460
[whispering]: Oh,
and she's pregnant.

643
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:15,660
# I thought my prayers... #

644
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,020

645
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:20,460
# would never be answered #

646
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:26,220
# but I kept the faith... #

647
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:27,980
[whispers]: I'm sorry.

648
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,540
I know this is
so stupid.

649
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:38,380
# out of nothing
you made my life anew #

650
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:46,220
# I found all these things
when I found you #

651
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,900
[sobbing]

652
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,580
Will you take
this man...

653
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,940
[whispering]: You said
you didn't want to cry.

654
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,260
...for better
for worse,

655
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,980
in good times and in bad,
for richer, for poorer...

656
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,300
[sobs]

657
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,820
in sickness,
and in health,

658
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:01,100
so long as you both
shall live?

659
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:03,180
I do.

660
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,620
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

661
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,740

You're having a terrible time.

668
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:11,020
Nope.

669
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:12,380
I'm just watching.

670
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,420
Yeah.

671
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,140
They're all so happy,
aren't they?

672
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,300
Have you ever been married?

673
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:18,940
No.

674
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,700
No.
Close?

675
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:23,020
No, I've just been...

676
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,380
Wrestling, you know?

677
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,740
Mm.

678
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,140
Wrestling.

00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,300
No kids?

680
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:32,460
Sometimes I help watch
my sister's daughter.

681
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:33,780
She's five, and a half.

682
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,020
So I help with her.

683
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:35,980
Oh.

684
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:36,940
Hey, pretty lady.

Hey!

686
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:38,860
Hey, come dance
with me.

687
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:39,820
Oh, no.

688
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:40,820
That's cool
with you, right?

689
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:41,780
Come on, now.

690
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:42,740
Okay.

691
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:43,700
You arranged
all this, right?

692
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:44,740

00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,140
Yeah.
He was nice.

697
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,180
Wasn't he?

698
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:27,380
He seems like
a really nice guy.

699
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:28,380
He's the greatest guy.

700
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,460
Yeah.

701
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,540
I'm sorry
I got drunk.

Oh, that's okay.

That's...

00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,260
I'm sorry I looked at
your drawings.

Oh...

706
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,420
I don't know why
I did that.

No, it's all right.

708
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:39,420
I'm sorry
I got weird about it.

709
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,900
I liked them, though.
They're good.

710

I-I like how there
aren't any people in them.

711
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:45,100
You don't
have to say that.

712
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:46,380
No, I did.
They...

I...

714
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:48,500
There's something
about an empty room.

715
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:50,460
I don't... there's
something about...

716
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:51,540
something
interesting about

717
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:52,620
what might happen next,

718
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:55,460
because you don't know.
It could...

719
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:58,420
Yeah, I guess.

720
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,820
You just hope
it's going to be good,

721
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:02,340
though, you know?

722

For whoever
steps inside.

723
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:08,420
At least I do.

That's really nice,
Walter.

are you doing?

No, just go
the fuck home!

Just ask him.

with the rummage sale.

I'm not hanging out with you
and your support group friends.

I'm not asking you
to come, Walter.

It's nice you have a new friend.

I went to a wedding
that she was working at.

One more,
up you go!

781
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:38,220
I don't know
how to talk to you,

782
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:40,900
so I just wrote some stuff down.

783
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:42,580
This is about the team, okay?
Hey...

I like to see.

your ma to sign, all right?

Just...

Okay,
watch it!

790
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:55,100
I think you'd be good at it.

791
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:56,700
Keep those feet
together.

792
00:47:56,820 --> 00:48:00,020
At least it'll help you
work off some of that stuff.

793
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:01,100
And again.

794

Come on, pick it up!

795
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,820
Wrestling helped me a lot
when I was your age.

796
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:09,340
All right, take five.

He's going to talk to you now.

800
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:30,580
Tommy was home by 11:00.

801
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:32,340
How do you
know that?

802
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:33,780
The news just started.

803
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:35,220
We watched it together.

804
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:36,700
The 11:00 news?

805
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:37,780
That's right.

806
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:39,340
We always watch
the news together,

807
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:40,620
and then
the late show after.

808
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:43,060
So at 11:00,

809
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:44,780
at least an hour before
the coroner said

810
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:46,580
the murder took place,

811
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:50,260
your son Thomas
was home with you?

812
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:53,180
That's what I said.

813
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:55,980
No more questions.

814
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:59,460
You may step down,
Mrs. Friedinger.

815
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:20,100
Walter, hey.

816
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:24,860
Hey.

817
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:28,860
So, uh...

818
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:30,780
Grace said yes when I proposed.

819
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:35,580
Congratulations.

820
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:36,860
Thanks.

821
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:38,060
Can I get in here for a second?

822
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:39,220
Yeah, sorry.

823
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:40,780
She's not going to tell
her parents she's pregnant

824
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:41,820
until after the wedding,

825
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:43,660
so we're moving
pretty fast here.

826
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:45,900
Okay.

827
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:48,780
So we want you to be
in the wedding party.

828
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:52,620
I mean,
you and your mom

829
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,700
should be part of this,
you know?

830
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:56,260
It just
wouldn't be right

831
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:59,340
if you all weren't
part of this.

832
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:09,300
Great.

833
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:11,660
Hey...

834
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:14,500
Thank you.

835
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:21,780
Yeah.

836
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:24,140
Thanks, man.

837
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:27,580
Yeah.

838
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:42,300
[grunting with effort]

839
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:54,020
How's he doing?

840
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:55,380
Wrestling's
a lot different

841
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:57,500
than fist-fighting.

842
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:58,620
Yeah.

843
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:04,060
But he stuck it through
the whole practice,

844
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:06,540
and he's still
at it.

845
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:13,060
I'll help him.

846
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:14,220
All right, you guys!

847
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:15,420
No conditioning
tomorrow morning,

848
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:19,380
light workout
tomorrow after school.

849
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:20,660
Okay, good.

850
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:21,940
You did good.

851
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:24,260
Come on,
off you go!

852
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,860
All right, good!

853
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:29,620
Are you sure this is
going to be all right?

854
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:30,900
Yeah, deaf kids
can wrestle. He's...

855
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:32,380
Okay.

856
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:33,500
You just, uh...

857
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:34,780
You might
want to get him

858
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:35,980
<i>some Ben-Gay
or something.</i>

859
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:37,980
And tell him
to take a hot shower

860
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:39,180
Before he goes to bed,

861
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:42,620
just so he doesn't
cramp up too much.

862
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:47,500
Thanks.

863
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:01,780
[judge]: Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

864
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,620
you have heard all the evidence.

865
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,100
Now it is my duty
to instruct you

866
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,420
on the law
that applies to this case.

867
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:11,140
You must base your decision
on the facts and the law,

868
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:13,180
and you must determine
these facts

869
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:15,660
from the evidence received
in this trial,

870
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:18,900
and not from any other sources.

871
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:24,060
Hey...

872
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:25,420
Hey.

873
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:30,380
The jury's deliberating.

874
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:32,860
Oh.

875
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:36,100
Hi.

876
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:37,180
Hi.

877
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:38,380
They're breaking
until Monday.

878
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:40,580
Sometimes it takes
a few hours,

879
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,220
sometimes it takes
a few days.

880
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:47,660
Friday's not a great day
to start deliberating, so...

881
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:50,700
they'll bring something
back next week.

882
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:53,980
I'm sure of it.

883
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:01,180
So, what are you
going to do with yourself

884
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:02,140
this weekend?

885
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,020
I don't know.

886
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,100
I have another wedding
on Saturday night.

887
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:12,380
You know,
if you want to kill some time.

888
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:17,620
They met on the internet.

889
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,500
[chuckles]

890
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:20,860
He's in a wheelchair.

891
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:23,220
She's works at a gym
in South Hills

892
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,820
teaching some exercise classes.

893
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:29,580
He's a professor at, uh,
CMU, in computers.

894
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,420
She's never even
been to college.

895
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:33,340
It's crazy.

896
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:34,980
[laughs]

897
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:39,460
So, you know, something to do.

898
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:49,620
Are you going to
say anything or not?

899
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:50,620
Uh, sure.

900
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:51,620
I-I'd...

901
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:52,860
I'll come.

902
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:54,660
I'll come
with you.

903
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:55,660
Okay.

904
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:58,060
I'd like that.

905
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:00,500
Okay.

906
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,260
Oh.

907
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:05,180
They're starting up,
so...

908
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:06,460
I'll see you later.

909
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:09,660
Okay, tomorrow
at, uh, 5:00.

910
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:13,820
[#]

911
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:30,820
[#]

912
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:23,420
Oh, your friend,
um, Brice,

913
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:24,420
came in here
with his fiancee

914
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:25,540
the other day.

915
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:28,620
Guess they're using
the community center

916
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:30,300
for the wedding.

917
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:31,780
Anyway, I told them
I'd help them out.

918
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:34,300
You know,
save some money.

919
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:39,260
That's nice.

920
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:45,260
Come on, Linda.

921
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:47,980
I want you
to dance.

922
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:49,020
We'll show you,
come on.

923
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:50,300
[chuckles]:
You want to dance?

924
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:51,420
No, I don't dance.

925
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,020
No, neither did
my husband.

926
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,380
Well, I'm going to.

927
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:55,500
You don't have to,
but I'm going to.

928
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:58,300
I want everybody to dance.

929
00:55:58,380 --> 00:55:59,820
I want everybody
to have fun.

930
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:02,780
Come on, Linda.

931
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:33,500
I'm sorry.

932
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:34,580
You're working.

933
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:35,660
Yeah, but I left you
sitting in here

934
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:36,700
for, like, an hour.

935
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:37,900
It's fine.
You're working.

936
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:39,060
It's-- it's okay.

937
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:40,100
I just had to make sure
all the unused bottles

938
00:56:40,220 --> 00:56:41,140
weren't billed

939
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:42,300
and the rose petals
were put away.

940
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:43,900
You going to
close up, Linda?

941
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:47,100
Oh, yeah, go on.
I'll-- I'll do it.

942
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:51,940
Thank you
for helping.

943
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:55,420
Oh, uh, yeah.
No problem.

944
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:57,020
You know, you don't
have to keep coming

945
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,140
to these things

946
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:00,540
if it's boring
for you.

947
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:02,300
No, it's--
it's okay. It's--

948
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:03,380
You sure?

949
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:05,340
Yeah, I had fun,
so...

950
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:08,260
Yeah, in your way.

951
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:09,340
In my way?

952
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:12,300
[chuckles]:
Yeah, your...

953
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:19,700
I know I'm a lot
older than you,

954
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:22,300
and I know I'm all...

955
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:24,780
fucked up.

956
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,260
No, please don't stop.

957
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:05,220
Please keep going.

958
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:08,820
No, just, please,
before I think too much.

959
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:37,900
Hi.

960
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:40,620
Hi.

[chuckles]

962
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:49,740
I...

963
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:54,020
I want you to
hold onto this for me.

964
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:57,180
If I tell Clay

965
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,060
you're keeping it for him--

966
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:00,100
I don't want it.

967
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:01,060
He won't
argue with me.

968
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:02,100
I can't have it
around here.

969
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:03,180
I don't want it.

970
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:05,820
To Clay...

971
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:08,500
this is what he has left
of his dad.

972
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:12,700
I can't just
throw it away.

973
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:53,700
I haven't,
since Larry died,

974
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:57,380
even been able
to talk to someone,

975
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:01,540
let alone
be with someone.

976
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:29,700
Yeah, I just, um...

977
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:33,500
I think I'd better
get going.

978
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:36,060
Good night.

979
01:00:36,140 --> 01:00:38,500
Good night.

Around this time
about a year ago

1010
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:15,500
I was a couple
tournaments away

1011
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:18,220
from making
the national team.

1012
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:22,300
There was this guy, Packer,

1013
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:24,580
and this other guy
from Northeast Pennsylvania.

1014
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:27,860
Said he'd give me
a run for it, but...

1015

man, I was close.

1016
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:35,420
Then one day I'm...

1017
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:39,260
in the middle of a workout.

1018
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:43,580
One of the trainers comes in.

1019
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:46,900
I could just tell by the way
she was looking at me

1020
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:56,140
that something...
really horrible had happened.

1021
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:59,580
So I take the first bus home.

1022
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:03,060
I get there,
and everything is just a mess.

1023

My little niece is asking
where her mommy is,

1024
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:09,580

1025
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:10,740

He's in no position to take her,

1027

that killed her.

1034

I mean, am I so screwed up

about this guy?

Hey...

1339
01:28:41,540 --> 01:28:45,020
You know,
when I was eight,

1340
01:28:45,140 --> 01:28:46,300
I asked Grammy

1341
01:28:46,420 --> 01:28:47,420
if I could have
the basement.

1342
01:28:47,540 --> 01:28:50,300
Because I didn't want
to share my room

1343
01:28:50,380 --> 01:28:54,620
with a girl anymore.

1344
01:28:54,740 --> 01:28:58,140
Your mom was
pretty mad about that.

1345
01:28:58,220 --> 01:29:00,540
She used to sneak down
into my room

1346
01:29:00,620 --> 01:29:04,420
and crawl into my bed
after I fell asleep.

1347
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:09,380
Just like you.

1348
01:29:12,220 --> 01:29:15,780
So that's why Grammy
bought her this,

1349
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:20,780
to keep her company
at night.

1350
01:29:22,220 --> 01:29:25,300
It would make her
feel better.

1351
01:29:27,340 --> 01:29:30,580
So...

1352
01:29:30,660 --> 01:29:34,820
I think it's time
for you to have this.

1353
01:29:36,620 --> 01:29:38,380

1354

1358
01:30:09,900 --> 01:30:13,340

It's the key to the weight room.

1362
01:30:35,260 --> 01:30:36,380
Coach Partenheimer says

1363
01:30:36,500 --> 01:30:38,660
he thinks you'll
do well next year.

1364

If you keep at it,

1365
01:30:39,860 --> 01:30:42,220
he thinks you might
make sectionals, so...

1366
01:30:47,620 --> 01:30:50,540
you'll be all right.

1367
