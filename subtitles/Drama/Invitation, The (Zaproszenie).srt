1
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,154
Will.

2
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:00,726
Will.

3
00:01:00,728 --> 00:01:02,861
Hey. I asked
if you were okay.

4
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:04,063
Sorry.

5
00:01:07,367 --> 00:01:09,668
You know, we don't
have to do this.

6
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,869
We can just go home.

7
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:12,204
I'll be fine.

8
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:16,508
God, this thing is so...

9
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,510
Thick...

10
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:20,112
Official.

11
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:23,582
Maybe they're
overcompensating.

12
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,284
It's kind of hard
to call everybody up

13
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:26,819
out of the blue
after two years.

14
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:28,921
Nobody's seen her?

15
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:31,290
I ran into her and David
at a supermarket,

16
00:01:31,292 --> 00:01:33,892
and a little bit
after that, I heard
they disappeared.

17
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:35,461
And they met
in the grief group?

18
00:01:35,463 --> 00:01:38,197
Mm-hmm, while we
were still married.

19
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:41,200
Yeah, I guess you
could have put odds
on our divorce.

20
00:01:41,202 --> 00:01:43,001
No, people
don't think like that.

21
00:01:43,003 --> 00:01:44,002
Yes, they do.

22
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:45,003
No, they don't.

23
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:46,105
Yes, they--

24
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:50,476
oh, my god.

25
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,678
Jesus.

26
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,079
What was that?

27
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:55,547
A coyote, I think.

28
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:01,954
Just stay here.

29
00:02:08,863 --> 00:02:10,062
Oh, man.

30
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,393
You should go
back in the car.

31
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:04,383
Okay, okay.

32
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:10,789
Oh, my god.

33
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:51,396
Jesus.

34
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,140
This was your house?

35
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:44,343
A lot of money
in Eden's family.

36
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:46,712
Wasn't ever mine.

37
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:09,968
<i> Come on, Ty.</i>

38
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:13,672
<i> Dinner's ready.</i>

39
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:26,985
Hey,
you're here.

40
00:06:26,987 --> 00:06:30,589
Fucking a.
I win, see? Hi!

41
00:06:30,591 --> 00:06:32,424
Was there
a betting pool?

42
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:34,526
Uh, for entertainment
purposes only.

43
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:36,395
- Hey.
- Hey, buddy.

44
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:38,497
I am Gina.
We met at their--

45
00:06:38,499 --> 00:06:40,232
- yes.
- Nice to see you.

46
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:41,600
- Good to see you.
- God, Kira,

47
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:42,968
you look
so fucking hot
right now.

48
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,170
Will you bear
a child for us,
like, right now?

49
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:46,338
We're not kidding.

50
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:49,274
And, you, I see
you've almost shed

51
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:51,209
that dirty dishrag look
that's so concerning.

52
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:53,211
What? I have
a dirty dishrag look?

53
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:54,513
Mm, less so now.

54
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:56,114
- It's just--
- what? Come on.

55
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:58,283
He did look
like a dishrag.

56
00:06:58,285 --> 00:06:59,951
How are you?

57
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:01,386
Eh...

58
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:03,522
Is this Kira?

59
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:04,956
- That's me.
- Hi. I'm Claire.

60
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:06,258
Hi. Nice to meet you.

61
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,592
Nice to meet you, too.

62
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,561
Hey, will, I'm Ben.
Remember me?

63
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:11,296
We drove a thriving
business into
the ground together.

64
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:12,431
Never thrived.

65
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:13,632
It was thriving
like a motherfucker

66
00:07:13,634 --> 00:07:15,367
for three months,
and you know it.

67
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:18,370
Hey, wait.
Where's choi?

68
00:07:18,372 --> 00:07:20,238
Late as usual,
and I can't get

69
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,406
any reception
up here either.

70
00:07:21,408 --> 00:07:23,108
Is Eden and, uh--

71
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,309
I'm here.

72
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,454
Oh.

73
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:37,956
Let me look at you, will.

74
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:42,761
Mm, I missed you.

75
00:07:42,763 --> 00:07:43,962
You, too.

76
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:46,898
House doesn't look
very different, does it?

77
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,367
No, not--not really.

78
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:51,870
Well, we're glad
you're here.

79
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:55,373
Oh.

80
00:07:57,043 --> 00:08:00,078
You're a mess.

81
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,746
And you must be Kira.

82
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:03,181
Hi.

83
00:08:03,183 --> 00:08:05,484
Thank you
for having me.

84
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:11,156
Will, you remember David.

85
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,058
Of course. Sure.

86
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:18,730
Will, come here.

87
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:20,031
Hey.

88
00:08:21,134 --> 00:08:23,068
I'm so glad you're here.

89
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,036
I'm really glad, man.

90
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:27,172
Hey, how--how are you?

91
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,406
Oh, I'm brilliant.

92
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:30,709
I mean, we've got
a lot to talk about,

93
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:32,611
so much
to celebrate tonight.

94
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:34,045
Kira.

95
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,580
Yes.

96
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:36,982
Ah.

97
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:38,617
Oh. Okay.

98
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:40,986
Beautiful.

99
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:43,488
What can
i get you to drink?

100
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,556
No, i-I'm good.

101
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:46,024
Uh, I'd go
with the wine.

102
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,659
It's an '85 rothschild.

103
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:49,261
Are you
shitting me?

104
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:51,196
Uh, okay,
what does that mean?

105
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,998
Oh, will,
you're adorable.

106
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,934
It's, like, $8 million
a bottle, cro-mag.

107
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,804
Well,
this night is special.

108
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:01,473
We shouldn't save
these things.

109
00:09:01,475 --> 00:09:04,876
We shouldn't
put off enjoying...

110
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,344
What we have.

111
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,345
You sure?

112
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:09,080
I'm good.

113
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:10,215
Yes. Thank you.

114
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,083
Well, since
everybody's here--

115
00:09:12,085 --> 00:09:13,118
except choi.

116
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,085
Oh, fucking choi,
man.

117
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:16,021
- Fucking choi.
- All right.

118
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:17,188
Except choi, but, you know,

119
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,224
I guess we'll just have
to start without him.

120
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:22,294
Um, first of all,

121
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:27,399
welcome to our
little reunion of sorts.

122
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:30,569
You guys are all
very special to Eden,

123
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:32,871
which--which means
you're very special to me,

124
00:09:32,873 --> 00:09:36,474
and we really missed you,
and we love you.

125
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:39,644
You know, each and every one
of us is on a journey,

126
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:42,414
and we feel
that it's important

127
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:45,684
to be on that journey
with the people you love,

128
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:51,022
and it's something
we really, really
have good here.

129
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,526
We want to open up
the house again,

130
00:09:54,528 --> 00:09:58,663
give it and us
a new start, so...

131
00:09:58,665 --> 00:10:01,967
Let's raise this
ridiculously expensive
glass of wine

132
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:04,336
to new beginnings.

133
00:10:04,338 --> 00:10:05,837
Yeah.

134
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,372
- To new beginnings.
- Cheers.

135
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:09,007
- Cheers.
-<i> Salud.</i>

136
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:11,810
Hey! Save a glass for me.

137
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,747
This is Sadie.

138
00:10:15,749 --> 00:10:18,083
Sadie,
meet my friends.

139
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:20,085
Hey.

140
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:21,586
- Hey.
- Hi.

141
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:27,292
So, um...

142
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,927
How do you guys
know each other?

143
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:30,962
Um...

144
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:34,265
Just friends
in common, I guess.

145
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:35,734
We met
in Mexico.

146
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:39,838
Sadie's
staying here with us
and helping us out.

147
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,272
Yeah.

148
00:10:41,274 --> 00:10:44,175
It's fun. We have fun.

149
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:48,780
Hope you don't mind me
crashing the party.
It's awesome.

150
00:10:48,782 --> 00:10:49,881
Huh.

151
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:53,652
They've told me
so much about you.

152
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,194
We hit a coyote
on the way up here.

153
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:04,195
- What?
- What?

154
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:05,697
It just came
out of nowhere.

155
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:07,732
I mean, there was
nothing we could do.

156
00:11:07,734 --> 00:11:10,035
It was
in horrible shape.

157
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:11,703
He had to kill it.

158
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:15,774
What? How did you
not tell us this,
like, immediately?

159
00:11:15,776 --> 00:11:20,578
You killed it
with, like, what?

160
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,880
Tire iron.

161
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,315
Oh, god. What?

162
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:26,885
I don't know
how you did it, man.
That's pretty butch.

163
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:29,020
No, it was
a good thing.

164
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,522
That was mercy.

165
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:31,956
Mm-hmm.

166
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:35,026
Would you mind
if I looked around
for a little bit?

167
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,661
Of course not.

168
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,564
Thank you.

169
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:42,534
See you in a bit.

170
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,371
Can't believe it.

171
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,707
A tire iron
requires a lot of...

172
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:51,076
- Wow.
- I know.

173
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:14,399
No, you don't. No, you don't.

174
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:17,736
No, you don't.
No. No. No!

175
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:20,038
- Will.

176
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,039
Jesus.

177
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:23,975
Sorry.
You scared me.

178
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:27,145
No harm done.

179
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:30,749
You're so handsome
tonight.

180
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:32,584
You're shining.

181
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:33,918
And, Kira,

182
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,821
you're both
really beautiful.

183
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,424
Thank you.

184
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,226
Heh.

185
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:48,299
Could you help me
get those glasses, please?

186
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:55,607
Bars on windows are new.

187
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:59,711
Well, I was here
alone for a while.

188
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:02,947
It's security,
safer.

189
00:13:06,585 --> 00:13:07,919
It's nice.

190
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,922
Thank you.

191
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:12,357
We got them
in Mexico.

192
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:15,527
Is that where you've been
for the last two years?

193
00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:17,028
Some of the time.

194
00:13:20,232 --> 00:13:21,633
Did you
worry about me?

195
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,201
Did you think
about me?

196
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:24,869
Yeah.

197
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:27,338
I did.

198
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,776
Well, I'm fantastic.

199
00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:33,144
I've never
been better.

200
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:36,147
You don't have to worry
about me anymore.

201
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,449
You don't find it hard
to be in this house again?

202
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:40,084
No, not at all.

203
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:41,920
It doesn't
have to be.

204
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:43,688
That's what's
so incredible.

205
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,291
You look different, Edie.

206
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:48,026
I am different.

207
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:49,661
I'm free.

208
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:53,164
All that useless pain,

209
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,165
it's gone.

210
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:59,103
It's something
anyone can have, will,

211
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:01,206
and I want you
to have it, too.

212
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:03,641
Eden looks hot.

213
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:05,543
I can say that,
right?

214
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:07,579
We're all
consenting adults.

215
00:14:08,982 --> 00:14:12,217
It's good to see you
again, Ben.

216
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:13,017
You, too.

217
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,453
It's been
way too long.

218
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:17,488
Heh.

219
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,057
I'm just here
for the food.

220
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:21,626
What were you guys
talking about?

221
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:26,030
Not my business.

222
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,999
I was just
telling will

223
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:29,934
that pain
is optional.

224
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:32,203
It is?

225
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,372
Why didn't anyone
tell me that before now?

226
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,573
I know.

227
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:38,409
But it's actually
really simple.

228
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,979
All those
negative emotions,

229
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:43,514
grief, anger,
depression,

230
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:45,650
is all just
chemical reactions.

231
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:48,686
It's entirely physical,
and it's completely
changeable.

232
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:50,822
Kind of sound like
a pamphlet there, Eden.

233
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:55,093
You can actually expel
those emotions

234
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:59,697
from your body
and live the life
you want to live.

235
00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:02,033
So you're
shitting out your pain?

236
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,938
I can see you're
not interested.

237
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,972
I'm sorry, Eden.

238
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:10,742
It just sounds
fucking crazy.

239
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,846
Eden, what the fuck?

240
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:18,449
Until you
stop making a joke
out of everything,

241
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:19,517
you'll never
learn a thing.

242
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:23,154
That's why nobody
cares what you think.

243
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,324
Um...

244
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:28,126
Yeah. Okay.

245
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:29,060
Heh.

246
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:31,296
She fucking
gored me, man.

247
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:34,532
That was loud.

248
00:15:35,902 --> 00:15:38,269
- Oh, it's not--
- for the vegetarians.

249
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:40,271
Has she been acting
like this all night?

250
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,606
Yeah. David, too.

251
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:45,543
Look, I'm all for whatever
you gotta do to get by,

252
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:48,313
especially you two,
with what you went through,

253
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:49,981
but you didn't lose
your mind.

254
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:52,350
Oh, I didn't?

255
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,119
Not like that.

256
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:01,926
How are you?

257
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:04,329
I don't know.

258
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:07,632
I don't really know
how to act.

259
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:12,070
Well, it's not like
the good old days
anymore, you know.

260
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:13,237
No.

261
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:14,906
No, it isn't.

262
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,609
Wait. Where's Amanda?

263
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:19,711
Home with the kids.

264
00:16:19,713 --> 00:16:21,579
- Yeah?
- Pissed.

265
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,983
What? What's up?

266
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:27,919
Think we hate
each other.

267
00:16:29,621 --> 00:16:31,189
That's not good.

268
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:33,024
Yeah. I know.

269
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,260
But the sex is--

270
00:16:36,262 --> 00:16:37,962
it's so...

271
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:40,565
- Angry.

272
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:43,935
I can't get away
from it, man.

273
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,139
Um, it's good to see you.

274
00:16:48,141 --> 00:16:49,140
You, too.

275
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:50,942
Mm.

276
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,511
Hey, no one cares
what I think?

277
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:54,512
No.

278
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:55,646
Come on? Really?

279
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:56,647
No.

280
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:59,517
Ben, have
a glass of wine.

281
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,120
I've let it go
already, and
so should you.

282
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,523
I'll always
have a drink.

283
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:08,092
See?
It's gone already.

284
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:14,799
We'll be here.

285
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:16,567
Come.
Sit with me.

286
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,569
Ask me a question.

287
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,406
Okay.

288
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:26,844
Seriously,
ask me a question.

289
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:28,446
Okay. Sorry.

290
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:29,480
Um--hey, wait.

291
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:30,848
You're up for tenure,
aren't you?

292
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:31,849
Yeah. I got it.

293
00:17:31,851 --> 00:17:32,950
Come on.

294
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:34,352
A year ago.

295
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,655
Year ago? Really?

296
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:39,891
I had a party
and everything.

297
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,193
I'm... sorry.

298
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:43,561
You don't have
to be sorry.

299
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,997
You're here now.

300
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,178
It's weird to be here,
isn't it?

301
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,879
Mm.

302
00:18:07,787 --> 00:18:10,655
Maybe that's choi,
our hero.

303
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:12,957
Fucking choi.

304
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:14,492
- Hey.

305
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,864
Aha.

306
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:22,366
Yeah, look.
I'm finally here.

307
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:23,534
Yeah.

308
00:18:23,536 --> 00:18:24,969
Who's that?

309
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,474
Hey.

310
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:33,778
Um, everybody...

311
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,581
It's you.

312
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,249
Oh, darlin'.

313
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:40,651
Oh, I can't believe
you're really here.

314
00:18:40,653 --> 00:18:42,453
This is
my friend pruitt.

315
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,522
- Hey.
- Hey.

316
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:47,692
Evening.

317
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:50,761
Eden.

318
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:51,963
How are you?

319
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,166
Mm.

320
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,603
Hey. I'm Ben.

321
00:18:58,605 --> 00:18:59,837
Nice to meet you.

322
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,240
I'm gonna grab
a whiskey. Did you
want anything?

323
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:04,242
Ah, anything diet
is fine, thanks.

324
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:05,309
Okay.

325
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:08,546
Hey. I'm Tommy.
Miguel, Kira, Gina.

326
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:09,547
Nice to meet you.

327
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:10,915
I have no idea.

328
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:12,049
I'm glad
you're here,

329
00:19:12,051 --> 00:19:13,351
but frankly where
the hell is choi?

330
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:14,652
Choi?

331
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,821
Is my asshole boyfriend.

332
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:19,357
Said he was gonna be
early for once.

333
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,759
He didn't call you guys,
say he was gonna be late?

334
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:24,228
No. Come on.
I thought he was
gonna come with you.

335
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,631
- Yeah, i--
- we haven't seen him.

336
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:29,500
All right, that's it.
I'm gonna try again.

337
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:32,803
Heh. Do you guys
have service up here?

338
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:34,038
Sorry.

339
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,573
Horrible.

340
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:37,942
And the bills fell
through the cracks
while we were away.

341
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:39,343
We have to get
them up here

342
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,078
and reconnect
the landline.
I'm sorry, Gina.

343
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,181
Well, he usually calls
at least once.

344
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:44,515
You know what?
Your best bet

345
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,484
is gonna be
in the back actually.

346
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:48,586
Good luck, though.

347
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:59,630
Is everything okay,
will?

348
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:02,033
Yeah. Yeah, why didn't
you leave the key
in the door, though?

349
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:06,938
There was a home invasion
up in the canyon
about a month ago.

350
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,973
- Oh.
- This couple got terrorized.

351
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:10,975
It was really sick.

352
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:13,277
Just kinda
freaked us out.

353
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:14,579
I didn't hear about it.

354
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:17,114
Then I'm sure
it never happened.

355
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:18,783
Yeah, come on,
will.

356
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:19,850
Can't a man
put himself

357
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:20,885
in lockdown
if he wants?

358
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:22,220
This is America.

359
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:25,790
Okay, what if
there was a fire?

360
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:32,563
Okay.

361
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:39,837
There you go.

362
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:42,807
Better?

363
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:44,642
I just keep
the house a little
differently.

364
00:20:44,644 --> 00:20:46,544
That's all.

365
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:48,312
It's my house.

366
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:53,451
Will, could you
do me a favor

367
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:55,019
and go get
some more
firewood?

368
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:57,088
You know
where we keep it.

369
00:21:09,901 --> 00:21:11,936
Has he been
like this a lot,

370
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:13,838
so agitated?

371
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,242
Sometimes.

372
00:21:19,978 --> 00:21:22,613
Well, I'm glad
he has you.

373
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,181
It comforts me.

374
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:28,686
I know he wants
the best for you, too.

375
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:31,422
I'm glad
you're here, Kira.

376
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:34,492
I think
it's important.

377
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,429
Can I ask you
something?

378
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:40,564
How has he been
handling things?

379
00:21:40,566 --> 00:21:43,267
He can be
self-destructive.

380
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,272
I think he's doing
the best he can.

381
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,079
<i> You're it.</i>

382
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:56,881
<i>You're it! Come on!</i>

383
00:23:47,793 --> 00:23:49,727
Come back to us
when you're ready.

384
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,775
<i> I'm telling you.</i>

385
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:06,310
<i>Why are you doing it?</i>

386
00:24:06,312 --> 00:24:08,979
Because it's--
you're very dirty here.

387
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:10,147
- Am I?
- Yes.

388
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:14,051
And it's
attention to detail

389
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:17,321
that is
incredibly important.

390
00:24:17,323 --> 00:24:18,789
It's my credo.

391
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:20,090
It's your credo?

392
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:22,426
It's a new--
i came up with it
last night. Hey.

393
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:25,796
Why don't you go
back to bed, okay?

394
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:28,098
We'll keep--
we'll keep it down.

395
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,800
- Okay.

396
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,169
Okay. I love you.

397
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:33,704
Good night, baby.

398
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:34,572
Good night.

399
00:24:34,574 --> 00:24:36,106
I love you, too. Night.

400
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:38,142
Good night, hon.

401
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,343
Mm.

402
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:40,678
And that'll be
the time he saw

403
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,979
his gross parents
having sex.

404
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,348
We are gross.

405
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:47,351
Mmm.

406
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:53,324
Do you think
he needs a brother?

407
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,067
No! Oh, my--

408
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:05,503
they're in a cult.

409
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:07,505
No, no, stop.
We're not in a cult.

410
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:09,373
I know plenty of people
who do the invitation.

411
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:10,407
- You do?
- Yeah, yeah.

412
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:12,209
Eden, you guys
really in this?

413
00:25:12,211 --> 00:25:13,511
We are.

414
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:15,746
So that's why
you were in Mexico?

415
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:18,716
Did you get
all naked down there
in the jungle?

416
00:25:18,718 --> 00:25:19,717
Sometimes.

417
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:22,920
Well, I did.

418
00:25:23,923 --> 00:25:25,456
Yeah, you did.

419
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:27,525
But, you know,
it's just--

420
00:25:27,527 --> 00:25:30,327
it's just
a group of people
coming together.

421
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:32,796
You know, they all
have lost someone,

422
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:34,365
and then they--
they help each other.

423
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:36,901
You know,
it's really a science

424
00:25:36,903 --> 00:25:41,038
rather than, like,
some weird religious cult
or anything.

425
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,475
You know,
it's smart people
like--like us,

426
00:25:44,477 --> 00:25:47,511
here in L.A.,
New York,

427
00:25:47,513 --> 00:25:48,679
thousands of people.

428
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:50,147
You'd be surprised.

429
00:25:50,149 --> 00:25:51,682
Yeah, my boss
is into it.

430
00:25:51,684 --> 00:25:53,918
It's like a new est
or something, right?

431
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,253
Yeah, no--

432
00:25:56,255 --> 00:25:58,255
I think
it's a little more
grounded than that,

433
00:25:58,257 --> 00:26:00,624
you know,
more practical.

434
00:26:00,626 --> 00:26:02,560
And at the same time,
it's very spiritual,

435
00:26:02,562 --> 00:26:03,861
you know,
however you define that.

436
00:26:03,863 --> 00:26:07,031
Seriously,
what goes on down there?

437
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:11,101
I mean, is it
like a self-help group
thing or...

438
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:13,137
Well...

439
00:26:13,139 --> 00:26:14,538
Since you asked,

440
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,341
we have something
that we'd like
to show you.

441
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:18,375
- David.
- Oh, no.

442
00:26:18,377 --> 00:26:19,743
- Oh, no.
- Yes, yes.

443
00:26:19,745 --> 00:26:21,111
No, no.

444
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:23,380
- Perfect. Just perfect.
- Oh, no. Now I understand

445
00:26:23,382 --> 00:26:24,582
- why the doors are locked.
- My bad.

446
00:26:24,584 --> 00:26:25,749
You're gonna
convert us.

447
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,451
This is
a conversion thing,
right?

448
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:29,787
Oh, my god.
No, this is
the real reason?

449
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:31,655
I know it sounds
a little weird,

450
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:34,058
but it's actually--
it's pretty amazing stuff.

451
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,459
Indulge us, okay.

452
00:26:35,461 --> 00:26:37,795
Is this some kind
of a recruitment video?

453
00:26:37,797 --> 00:26:39,597
I really
don't want to--

454
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,999
I do. Convert me.
I am weak.

455
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:42,967
Yeah, you are.

456
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:45,803
It's nothing like that.
Promise.

457
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,505
All right, let's do this.

458
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:59,650
<i>This is our home</i>
<i>in sonora, Mexico,</i>

459
00:26:59,652 --> 00:27:03,520
<i>and it is your home, too,</i>
<i>if you choose it to be.</i>

460
00:27:03,522 --> 00:27:05,155
<i> Our home and our family</i>

461
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:07,458
<i>is open to anyone</i>

462
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:11,028
<i> with the desire</i>
<i> to help themselves.</i>

463
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:16,467
<i>The human brain has</i>
<i>a remarkable ability to heal.</i>

464
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:19,370
<i> My life's work</i>
<i> has been to discover</i>

465
00:27:19,372 --> 00:27:22,272
<i> new ways to rewire,</i>
<i> to rewrite</i>

466
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:26,510
<i>our experiences with trauma.</i>

467
00:27:26,512 --> 00:27:30,014
<i>I mean, trauma has visited...</i>

468
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:32,516
<i> All of us.</i>

469
00:27:32,518 --> 00:27:35,219
<i>We invite you</i>
<i>to a conscious existence,</i>

470
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:39,523
to a connected existence.

471
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:41,759
<i>But we take this journey,</i>

472
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:44,995
<i>all journeys side by side.</i>
<i>You are not alone.</i>

473
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:49,166
<i> Wherever you are,</i>

474
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:53,904
<i>we--we transcend, hmm?</i>

475
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:06,216
<i> How do you feel, Annie?</i>

476
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:10,187
<i>I feel loved.</i>

477
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:15,659
You are loved.

478
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:18,629
<i> You are deeply loved.</i>

479
00:28:18,631 --> 00:28:21,065
<i> Who are you</i>
<i> going to see, dear?</i>

480
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:27,104
<i> My husband...</i>

481
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:31,575
<i> James...</i>

482
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:33,744
<i> My father.</i>

483
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:36,613
<i> It's all right.</i>

484
00:28:39,518 --> 00:28:42,386
<i> They will</i>
<i> all be there.</i>

485
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:44,488
<i> I--</i>

486
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,256
<i> soon, Annie.</i>

487
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:47,925
Soon.

488
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:54,231
<i> Over soon.</i>

489
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:57,634
<i> All of the pain and</i>
<i> all of the grief,</i>

490
00:28:57,636 --> 00:28:59,536
<i> you renounced it,</i>
<i> haven't you?</i>

491
00:28:59,538 --> 00:29:01,638
<i> You've made a choice.</i>

492
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:07,745
<i> You're ready to go,</i>
<i> aren't you, honey?</i>

493
00:29:14,487 --> 00:29:15,519
<i> Come.</i>

494
00:29:15,521 --> 00:29:17,488
<i> Come. Breathe in.</i>

495
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:20,224
<i> Breathe in.</i>
<i> Breathe deeply.</i>

496
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,093
<i> You feel</i>
<i> her spirit?</i>

497
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,995
<i> I can feel it.</i>

498
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,298
<i> I can feel it.</i>

499
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:52,156
<i> She's with</i>
<i> all of us now...</i>

500
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,360
<i> And your father...</i>

501
00:29:58,363 --> 00:29:59,830
<i> And your wife...</i>

502
00:29:59,832 --> 00:30:02,399
And your son.

503
00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:04,501
<i> Don't cry.</i>

504
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:07,204
<i> There's no darkness,</i>

505
00:30:07,206 --> 00:30:09,273
<i> just reunion.</i>

506
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:14,077
<i> Annie is safe now.</i>

507
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:31,762
This is
what it's about.

508
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:36,400
We did not just
watch somebody die.

509
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,237
That was real?

510
00:30:40,239 --> 00:30:41,939
- Yes, it was.
- Yeah.

511
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,042
Why would anyone
want to watch that?

512
00:30:45,044 --> 00:30:47,978
She just wanted
to show everyone

513
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:51,582
that there's nothing
to be afraid of.
That was the point.

514
00:30:51,584 --> 00:30:53,650
She was very sick.

515
00:30:53,652 --> 00:30:54,952
With what?

516
00:30:54,954 --> 00:30:57,354
She barely looked 30.

517
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:59,556
Cancer.

518
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:01,358
Look, I get it.

519
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,926
If you
gotta go at 30,

520
00:31:02,928 --> 00:31:04,561
it's not a bad way,

521
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:06,196
surrounded by people
who love you.

522
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:07,497
On video?

523
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:10,000
It's beautiful.

524
00:31:11,337 --> 00:31:13,370
It's
a little grim.

525
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,105
She looked
at peace to me.

526
00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:17,140
- I'm not judging her.
- No, I know, babe.

527
00:31:17,142 --> 00:31:19,810
Yeah, no one's
judging her.

528
00:31:19,812 --> 00:31:21,345
I just don't understand
why you'd show

529
00:31:21,347 --> 00:31:23,413
something like that at
a dinner party, David.

530
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:26,650
- You don't get it?
- Mm-mmm.

531
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:30,220
I guess this is
not really being taken
the way we meant it.

532
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:34,725
I mean, it is
a pretty heavy thing
to drop on us, David.

533
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:36,927
But it's not heavy.

534
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:38,161
For us, it's not.

535
00:31:38,163 --> 00:31:39,763
- No.
- It's okay.

536
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:41,198
Not everybody gets it.

537
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,369
It's not about the fact
that she died. We all die.

538
00:31:45,371 --> 00:31:46,370
What's it about?

539
00:31:46,372 --> 00:31:49,039
It's about communion.

540
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:51,108
Right,
like Eden said,

541
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:53,143
she's just
trying to show you

542
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:55,078
that there's nothing
to be afraid of.

543
00:31:57,515 --> 00:32:01,919
Look at me. My pain
had turned me into
some walking cliché.

544
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:04,855
I was a coked-up,
out-of-control

545
00:32:04,857 --> 00:32:07,057
record producer,
for god's sake.

546
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:10,193
I was a slave
to my own grief,

547
00:32:10,195 --> 00:32:12,729
but not anymore.

548
00:32:12,731 --> 00:32:15,365
Dr. Joseph
freed me from that.

549
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:16,366
I just...

550
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:17,301
Phew!

551
00:32:17,303 --> 00:32:20,671
He gave me back
my center, you know?

552
00:32:20,673 --> 00:32:23,507
I don't have to be
afraid anymore.

553
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:25,542
Amen, brother.

554
00:32:28,414 --> 00:32:31,348
You know, we've all been
through horrible things,

555
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:35,052
but those things
don't have to define us.

556
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:39,056
What happened
to Eden and will--

557
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:40,257
no, don't. Don't!

558
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:41,725
David, don't.

559
00:32:41,727 --> 00:32:43,927
Finding this
saved my life.

560
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:47,064
I almost died after.

561
00:32:47,066 --> 00:32:48,632
I almost
couldn't keep on living.

562
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:49,833
You know that, will.

563
00:32:50,835 --> 00:32:52,002
But look at me now.

564
00:32:52,004 --> 00:32:54,304
I'm great. I'm happy.

565
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:58,575
I'm not angry anymore.

566
00:32:58,577 --> 00:33:02,079
And if anyone is
gonna try to take that
away from me...

567
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:08,185
My god, look at the way
you're looking at me.

568
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:14,825
If anyone is gonna try
to say that this isn't--

569
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:17,160
Edie, i--Edie--

570
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:18,862
it's just you
don't think I know?

571
00:33:18,864 --> 00:33:20,263
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

572
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:21,965
- I know!
- Let's get a drink.

573
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:23,233
It's just
that easy for you?

574
00:33:23,235 --> 00:33:25,068
Come on.
Come on. Let's
get a drink.

575
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:35,512
Yeah, we all are lost.

576
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:38,281
We can agree
on that, right?

577
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:41,018
It's just...

578
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,289
It's too big.

579
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:50,093
It's too big
for any of us alone.

580
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,164
You got to...

581
00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:02,205
That better be--

582
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:04,574
no, I've got it.
I've got it. I got it.

583
00:34:09,114 --> 00:34:10,514
David.

584
00:34:10,516 --> 00:34:12,349
Oh, sorry.

585
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:15,419
Excuse me for a second.

586
00:34:23,428 --> 00:34:24,428
Hi there.

587
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,497
- Hey.
- Hey.

588
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:28,732
Are you okay?

589
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:29,766
I-I'm sorry.

590
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:31,168
No, not you.

591
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,704
I mean, I knew it was
gonna be heavy, but...

592
00:34:34,706 --> 00:34:38,608
I was just--why choi and i
were supposed to be
here together for you.

593
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:41,445
We have to make
a better effort.
It's on us,

594
00:34:41,447 --> 00:34:44,681
and I was trying
to give you space,

595
00:34:44,683 --> 00:34:47,951
and I don't know
if that came across
like I was checked out.

596
00:34:47,953 --> 00:34:50,087
It's...

597
00:34:50,089 --> 00:34:52,689
I think
you should probably...

598
00:34:52,691 --> 00:34:54,658
Okay, hello.
I don't--

599
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:58,495
you haven't heard
a word I said, have you?

600
00:34:58,497 --> 00:34:59,930
I-I'm sorry, Gina.

601
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:04,534
Just a couple people
looking for a party on foot.

602
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:06,903
Good luck. They'll die
of dehydration.

603
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:08,105
Yeah.

604
00:35:12,277 --> 00:35:15,412
Anyway, um,
we can talk later.

605
00:35:15,414 --> 00:35:19,249
I just--i wanted you
to know that...

606
00:35:19,251 --> 00:35:21,618
I have been
thinking about you.

607
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,986
- Yeah.
- All right?

608
00:35:22,988 --> 00:35:24,855
- I love you...
- I love you, too.

609
00:35:24,857 --> 00:35:25,856
And I miss you.

610
00:35:25,858 --> 00:35:27,357
I miss you, too.

611
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:30,660
I'm gonna get a refill.

612
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:31,962
Get a--get a drink.

613
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:44,274
I feel like you guys
have to come to my house.

614
00:35:44,276 --> 00:35:47,144
I--that's all I do.
Get ice cream and...

615
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,671
Are you gonna
come and join us
at some point?

616
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:18,708
Will?

617
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:22,279
Can you tell me
what that is?

618
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,581
It is a pill, will.

619
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:26,249
I found a bunch of it
in Eden's bedroom

620
00:36:26,251 --> 00:36:27,751
- unlabeled--
- wait. What are you--

621
00:36:27,753 --> 00:36:29,386
please just look at it.

622
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,657
It's phenobarbital,
i think.

623
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:35,058
Is that dangerous?

624
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,861
Anything is dangerous if
you take too much of it.

625
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:39,162
It's a barbiturate.

626
00:36:39,164 --> 00:36:41,298
I mean, it's old-school,
but it's...

627
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,966
Not unusual to find it

628
00:36:42,968 --> 00:36:45,368
if you're rifling
through somebody's
medicine cabinet.

629
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:48,071
Hey, hey, break up
your little clique.

630
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:49,439
Come talk to us.

631
00:36:50,975 --> 00:36:53,243
Come on. Let's go.

632
00:36:53,245 --> 00:36:56,846
Apparently
v.I.P. Room
is in the kitchen.

633
00:36:56,848 --> 00:36:58,014
Guys,
guys, guys,

634
00:36:58,016 --> 00:36:59,349
join us, please.

635
00:36:59,351 --> 00:37:00,717
Just opened
another bottle.

636
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:01,885
Oh, yes.

637
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:03,453
Probably needs
a little more air.

638
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:05,755
I mean it, Miguel.
Just keep it
between us.

639
00:37:05,757 --> 00:37:06,990
Okay, snoopy.

640
00:37:06,992 --> 00:37:08,058
Ah, man.

641
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,759
Can you give this one
to Miguel?

642
00:37:09,761 --> 00:37:10,994
- Yeah.
-<i> Gracias.</i>

643
00:37:10,996 --> 00:37:12,696
<i> De nada.</i>

644
00:37:12,698 --> 00:37:13,697
Ah, smell that.

645
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:16,466
Okay.

646
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,436
<i> Salud.</i>

647
00:37:19,438 --> 00:37:20,370
<i> Salud.</i>

648
00:37:20,372 --> 00:37:21,905
Will thinks
you guys are on pills.

649
00:37:23,175 --> 00:37:24,808
Figuratively.

650
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,110
You think we're crazy?

651
00:37:27,112 --> 00:37:28,545
I never said that.

652
00:37:28,547 --> 00:37:30,547
That's okay.
I'm not offended.

653
00:37:30,549 --> 00:37:32,449
A lot of people
think we're crazy.

654
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:37,087
But I doubt they're
as happy as we are.

655
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:42,259
Where's the diet
again?

656
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:47,364
Why?

657
00:37:47,366 --> 00:37:49,032
<i> No comprendo inglés.</i>

658
00:37:49,034 --> 00:37:50,600
- Thank you.
-<i> De nada.</i>

659
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:53,169
Or don't you guys think
this is a little bit weird?

660
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:54,671
Look, will,
there is no way

661
00:37:54,673 --> 00:37:56,806
that tonight
wasn't gonna feel
a little strange...

662
00:37:57,975 --> 00:38:00,176
Or sad.

663
00:38:00,178 --> 00:38:02,312
Look, this is just
a long-overdue reunion

664
00:38:02,314 --> 00:38:05,448
between old friends

665
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:09,786
with a couple
of totally frickin'
friend weirdoes.

666
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,187
They're a little mansony.

667
00:38:11,189 --> 00:38:13,456
- "Mansonian"?
- And that skinny girl--

668
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,025
look, I'm not kidding.
Come on.

669
00:38:15,027 --> 00:38:17,627
Hey, I got you.
Look at me.

670
00:38:17,629 --> 00:38:19,929
Yeah, they're
a little weird,
but this is L.A.

671
00:38:19,931 --> 00:38:21,097
They're harmless.

672
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:23,166
Let's just get
through this night,

673
00:38:23,168 --> 00:38:24,367
give them a break.

674
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:25,835
Let's steal some more
of this wine.

675
00:38:25,837 --> 00:38:28,872
Oh, now that is
something I can
get behind. Come on.

676
00:38:28,874 --> 00:38:30,307
Hey, guys, listen!

677
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:34,144
I realize that some of you
might have found that video

678
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:37,180
a little disturbing
or off-putting,

679
00:38:37,182 --> 00:38:39,716
and I apologize for that.

680
00:38:39,718 --> 00:38:40,750
It's cool.

681
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:41,685
Nah, Gina, it's not.

682
00:38:41,687 --> 00:38:43,453
Last thing I want
you guys to think

683
00:38:43,455 --> 00:38:45,955
is that I'm trying
to force my ideas on you.

684
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:47,424
- Welcome back.
- Hey.

685
00:38:47,426 --> 00:38:50,160
You know,
it's just I want
you guys to know me.

686
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:53,563
There's this game we
used to play in Mexico
at the end of group,

687
00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:56,466
and I think
we should try it.

688
00:38:56,468 --> 00:38:58,468
What kind of game
are we talking about?

689
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,403
Like charades
or something?

690
00:39:00,405 --> 00:39:03,807
Ah, it'll be fun,
and it'll give you a sense
of what we learned, right?

691
00:39:03,809 --> 00:39:05,408
I'm in.
What is it?

692
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:08,144
Okay, it's kind of
like that game

693
00:39:08,146 --> 00:39:10,246
we played in college,
"i never."

694
00:39:10,248 --> 00:39:12,115
- Oh, yeah.
- I always lose that game.

695
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:13,516
Oh, I never do.

696
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:14,884
Except this time,
it's "i want,"

697
00:39:14,886 --> 00:39:18,254
so we take turns,

698
00:39:18,256 --> 00:39:19,823
and everybody gets
to say what they want.

699
00:39:19,825 --> 00:39:21,958
I want to hear
what Gina did in college.

700
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,259
You mean
who she did.

701
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:27,364
The point is
to be honest.

702
00:39:27,366 --> 00:39:29,599
All right? To admit
your desires.

703
00:39:29,601 --> 00:39:31,468
You know,
because anything
is possible

704
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:35,672
once you strip away
social constraints
and embarrassment

705
00:39:35,674 --> 00:39:38,375
and those negative emotions
that, you know--

706
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:40,443
the things
that hold us down.

707
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:45,048
So honesty, okay?
That's what it's about.

708
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:47,484
Want to give it a shot?

709
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,253
I'll go first.

710
00:39:50,255 --> 00:39:51,554
Wonderful.

711
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:57,794
Okay. I want...

712
00:39:58,963 --> 00:40:02,499
To tell you,
Eden, and David...

713
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:08,805
Will and Kira
and Gina,

714
00:40:08,807 --> 00:40:10,006
Miguel...

715
00:40:10,008 --> 00:40:11,641
Pack a lunch.

716
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:13,843
And Tommy--
there are so many.

717
00:40:13,845 --> 00:40:19,215
Ben, Claire, pruitt...

718
00:40:19,217 --> 00:40:21,818
I want to tell you all
that I love you.

719
00:40:23,487 --> 00:40:27,190
I know I haven't known
some of you for very long,

720
00:40:27,192 --> 00:40:31,227
but tonight I feel love.

721
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:32,662
I do.

722
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:38,234
And a lot of people
don't say that.
They're afraid.

723
00:40:38,236 --> 00:40:42,672
But--so, I love you.

724
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:49,379
- Oh.
- Mm.

725
00:40:49,381 --> 00:40:51,214
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my.

726
00:40:51,216 --> 00:40:53,183
Oh, my gosh.

727
00:40:55,654 --> 00:40:57,787
This is...

728
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:00,356
Wow.

729
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:02,325
Hi there.

730
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:03,827
You got it?

731
00:41:03,829 --> 00:41:05,628
Uh-huh.
All right.

732
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,797
Um...

733
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:10,400
I want...

734
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:14,437
Some of that coke
you used to do.

735
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:17,240
Done. I think
i might have some more.

736
00:41:17,242 --> 00:41:19,042
You keep it
in the house?

737
00:41:19,044 --> 00:41:20,710
You're
the worst rehabber
in the world.

738
00:41:20,712 --> 00:41:22,912
No, David, don't.
I was kidding.

739
00:41:22,914 --> 00:41:25,648
No, you weren't.
That's okay.

740
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:27,383
That's the point
of the game.

741
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:29,986
Okay.

742
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:31,788
I wasn't kidding.

743
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:34,057
Bust that shit out.

744
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,226
There you go.

745
00:41:36,228 --> 00:41:38,761
I like
this game.

746
00:41:38,763 --> 00:41:40,997
I want to tell you
about my wife
Margaret.

747
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,503
We were married
eight years,

748
00:41:46,505 --> 00:41:48,571
would have been 15
next month.

749
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:52,942
She was a painter, oils.

750
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:59,716
First saw her work
at this artists retreat
in Minneapolis.

751
00:41:59,718 --> 00:42:02,418
I was in love with her
before I even met her.

752
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:08,091
These abstract,
energetic landscapes...

753
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:12,896
And then I saw her.

754
00:42:13,899 --> 00:42:16,633
Wow. It was like
I'd hit the jackpot.

755
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:21,938
She was the most generous
spirit I'd ever seen,

756
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:25,775
and she was as bright
and gorgeous as...

757
00:42:27,478 --> 00:42:28,711
The morning.

758
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,549
When you surprised her,

759
00:42:32,551 --> 00:42:34,817
she had this--this laugh,

760
00:42:34,819 --> 00:42:37,854
this joyous,
guttural rumble

761
00:42:37,856 --> 00:42:40,757
that came from
way down deep inside.

762
00:42:40,759 --> 00:42:43,927
You knew you'd done
something good.

763
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:48,665
She was all light,
all light.

764
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:52,635
During times
like this, um,

765
00:42:52,637 --> 00:42:55,505
nights like
this night...

766
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,641
I think of her
quite a bit.

767
00:42:59,443 --> 00:43:01,811
Did she, uh,
pass away?

768
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,582
Yes, she did.

769
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:08,184
We had
been drinking.

770
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:12,722
I had been drinking.

771
00:43:12,724 --> 00:43:14,424
We had
just come home
from a dinner,

772
00:43:14,426 --> 00:43:16,025
and we were
in the kitchen.

773
00:43:16,027 --> 00:43:18,661
We'd fell into one
of those arguments,
you know,

774
00:43:18,663 --> 00:43:20,797
one of those
stupid fights

775
00:43:20,799 --> 00:43:22,498
that last
your whole marriage.

776
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,901
It was
about the dishes.

777
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,771
Somebody
started yelling.

778
00:43:28,773 --> 00:43:31,040
I don't
remember who.

779
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:34,611
I went to pour myself
another drink.

780
00:43:34,613 --> 00:43:37,046
She tried to stop me,
and...

781
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:40,483
Something just gave.

782
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:44,053
I turned and hit her
as hard as I could.

783
00:43:46,223 --> 00:43:49,025
Her knees buckled.

784
00:43:49,027 --> 00:43:50,226
She hit her head.

785
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:58,601
Think she was trying
to get back up.

786
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:02,005
You know, she had
her hand out,

787
00:44:02,007 --> 00:44:03,873
was staring at me.

788
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:08,478
And then
she collapsed,

789
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,580
and she was gone.

790
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,620
What the fuck?

791
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:22,258
It was a terrible,
terrible mistake.

792
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,560
It was seven years ago.

793
00:44:24,562 --> 00:44:25,628
I went to prison.

794
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:27,964
I paid that way,

795
00:44:27,966 --> 00:44:30,900
but I was still
the same person.

796
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:38,574
Finally, by accepting
the invitation...

797
00:44:39,443 --> 00:44:42,512
And looking only ahead,

798
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:45,415
destroying that
horrible part of me

799
00:44:45,417 --> 00:44:47,183
that made
that moment possible...

800
00:44:50,421 --> 00:44:51,888
I'm cured.

801
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:55,958
And I miss her.

802
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:02,365
Not a day goes by
i don't think of her.

803
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:04,767
But I don't grieve,

804
00:45:04,769 --> 00:45:06,903
and I don't
feel guilty anymore.

805
00:45:06,905 --> 00:45:09,505
I've chosen
to let that go.

806
00:45:09,507 --> 00:45:11,174
Those emotions
are useless,

807
00:45:11,176 --> 00:45:14,343
because I'm gonna be
seeing her again

808
00:45:14,345 --> 00:45:17,213
in a better place
than this.

809
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:20,316
That's what we believe.

810
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:22,118
That's what most people
have believed
for centuries.

811
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:24,187
I, for one,
can't wait to get there.

812
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:30,093
But forgiveness
doesn't have to wait.

813
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:33,596
I'm free
to forgive myself,

814
00:45:33,598 --> 00:45:36,699
and so are you.

815
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:39,769
It's a beautiful thing.

816
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:42,338
It really is.

817
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,883
What's more honorable,

818
00:45:53,885 --> 00:45:57,253
facing the truth or
hiding it to be accepted?

819
00:45:57,255 --> 00:45:58,855
And people change.

820
00:45:58,857 --> 00:46:00,723
I don't know.
This...

821
00:46:00,725 --> 00:46:02,558
Doesn't seem
very honest.

822
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,662
It feels like you're
selling us something.

823
00:46:06,664 --> 00:46:08,898
No, we aren't.

824
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,032
I want...

825
00:46:10,034 --> 00:46:12,468
Are we really
gonna keep
doing this?

826
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:14,637
- I want--
- this better be good.

827
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:15,838
I want to kiss Ben.

828
00:46:17,574 --> 00:46:20,243
I always have.

829
00:46:28,353 --> 00:46:29,619
Why the hell not?

830
00:46:29,621 --> 00:46:30,887
Bring it, sister.

831
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:32,121
Oh, my god.

832
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:34,023
I want
to kiss Ben.

833
00:46:34,025 --> 00:46:35,625
One per party.

834
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:39,362
- Um, no.
- Boom. No?

835
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:43,533
- Whoo!
- Oh!

836
00:46:43,535 --> 00:46:46,469
- Oh, yeah!
- Get it, girl!

837
00:46:47,939 --> 00:46:50,940
- Ah!
- Get it, girl.

838
00:46:50,942 --> 00:46:52,208
Go!

839
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,445
Jeez.

840
00:46:56,447 --> 00:46:59,382
I don't know
if I approve that.

841
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:03,319
And nobody
tells Amanda.

842
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:05,755
Uh, I want a blow job...

843
00:47:05,757 --> 00:47:07,390
Oh, you're
ridiculous.

844
00:47:07,392 --> 00:47:08,391
From somebody.

845
00:47:08,393 --> 00:47:09,525
Oh, I know.

846
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:12,695
What?
I'm not joking.

847
00:47:12,697 --> 00:47:13,896
I have to go.

848
00:47:13,898 --> 00:47:15,698
No, come on.
We're just having fun.

849
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:16,933
It's all right.

850
00:47:16,935 --> 00:47:19,302
This is all making me
a little uncomfortable.

851
00:47:19,304 --> 00:47:20,770
I'm sorry.

852
00:47:20,772 --> 00:47:22,638
Come on. I'll--

853
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:23,973
have a seat.
I'll get you a drink.

854
00:47:23,975 --> 00:47:24,974
We'll do
something else.

855
00:47:24,976 --> 00:47:26,609
No, no, no.
I don't want

856
00:47:26,611 --> 00:47:27,710
to spoil
anyone's fun.

857
00:47:27,712 --> 00:47:29,412
This just
isn't my thing.

858
00:47:29,414 --> 00:47:30,947
- Claire, please.
- Hey, just--

859
00:47:30,949 --> 00:47:32,882
just let her go, David.

860
00:47:32,884 --> 00:47:34,817
Why can't she just leave?

861
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:38,454
Will, I just
want her to stay

862
00:47:38,456 --> 00:47:39,889
and have a good time,

863
00:47:39,891 --> 00:47:41,657
and Eden has
planned this night
for a long time.

864
00:47:41,659 --> 00:47:42,992
We'll be
very disappointed.

865
00:47:42,994 --> 00:47:45,361
Yeah, well, just let her
do what she wants, okay?

866
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:48,097
I'm gonna leave.

867
00:47:50,634 --> 00:47:52,301
Of course.

868
00:47:52,303 --> 00:47:54,036
- Bye.
- Bye.

869
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:55,738
I'm sorry
if I've made you
feel uncomfortable.

870
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:58,040
It's--it's okay.
I'm tired.

871
00:47:58,042 --> 00:47:59,742
Claire,

872
00:47:59,744 --> 00:48:02,011
why don't you just stay
a little longer?

873
00:48:02,013 --> 00:48:04,780
I'll see you again
soon, okay?

874
00:48:04,782 --> 00:48:06,282
I'm really sorry.

875
00:48:09,253 --> 00:48:10,753
Okay, Claire.

876
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:15,358
Eden, it's okay.

877
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:16,459
I know.

878
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,896
Do you want me
to walk you to your car?

879
00:48:19,898 --> 00:48:21,964
It's, like,
40 feet, will.

880
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,100
Bye.

881
00:48:24,102 --> 00:48:25,468
- Bye, Claire.
- Bye.

882
00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:27,303
- Nice meeting you.
- Bye.

883
00:48:27,305 --> 00:48:28,738
Are you
in the prius?

884
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,306
Yeah.

885
00:48:30,308 --> 00:48:32,308
I parked
behind you.

886
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,982
Bye. Thank you, guys.

887
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:46,355
- What?
- Why did she leave?

888
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:53,863
Hey, will,
come over here,
and talk to me.

889
00:48:53,865 --> 00:48:55,298
Just give me a sec.

890
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:19,488
So what do you do?

891
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:21,824
- Okay.
- Well, I'm a nurse's assistant.

892
00:49:21,826 --> 00:49:23,826
Careful on the right.

893
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:26,829
Okay.

894
00:49:26,831 --> 00:49:28,264
Straight out.

895
00:49:28,266 --> 00:49:30,032
You're all set.

896
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,441
Oh, uh, Claire.

897
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:41,410
- Miguel.
- I save lives.

898
00:49:41,412 --> 00:49:42,411
Stop.

899
00:49:42,413 --> 00:49:45,381
Will, come on.

900
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:50,353
Can you and I talk
alone for a minute?

901
00:49:50,355 --> 00:49:51,854
It's important.

902
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:56,225
Yeah. Yeah.

903
00:49:56,227 --> 00:49:58,027
Come on.

904
00:50:00,931 --> 00:50:02,999
I'm very happy
you're here.

905
00:50:03,001 --> 00:50:06,836
It's so important
to Eden and me.

906
00:50:06,838 --> 00:50:09,939
I mean, we chose you
because you matter to us.

907
00:50:09,941 --> 00:50:11,474
You chose me?

908
00:50:11,476 --> 00:50:12,875
To be here tonight.

909
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:16,912
But I don't know, man.

910
00:50:16,914 --> 00:50:19,181
Y-you've been acting so...

911
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:21,817
Suspicious
of our hospitality.

912
00:50:21,819 --> 00:50:23,853
Frankly,
it upsets me a little.

913
00:50:23,855 --> 00:50:27,356
I lock the door,
and you have a fit about it.

914
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:30,760
Just now, my friend
wants to move his car,

915
00:50:30,762 --> 00:50:32,161
and you're standing
by the window

916
00:50:32,163 --> 00:50:34,196
like you're gonna catch him
stealing something.

917
00:50:34,198 --> 00:50:36,866
You seem very distant,
very...

918
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:40,202
Just off somehow.

919
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:44,507
I'm sorry.

920
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,412
Maybe I wasn't prepared
to be here tonight.

921
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:53,249
Okay.

922
00:50:53,251 --> 00:50:54,650
Okay.

923
00:50:54,652 --> 00:50:57,420
I appreciate your honesty.

924
00:50:57,422 --> 00:51:00,723
Look, i--i understand
that you feel

925
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:02,992
like you have to be
on the lookout.

926
00:51:02,994 --> 00:51:05,327
I know, because
that's how I felt.

927
00:51:05,329 --> 00:51:08,397
The world is unsafe
and chaotic,

928
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:10,066
and, you know,
it happened before.

929
00:51:10,068 --> 00:51:11,500
It can always
happen again.

930
00:51:11,502 --> 00:51:13,803
David, please.
I don't pretend to know

931
00:51:13,805 --> 00:51:16,205
what you went through
with your wife,

932
00:51:16,207 --> 00:51:19,909
and you don't know me.
You can't.

933
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:28,751
Hey.

934
00:51:28,753 --> 00:51:30,052
Hi.

935
00:51:30,054 --> 00:51:31,620
I tried to convince
Claire to stay.

936
00:51:31,622 --> 00:51:35,157
I felt bad about,
uh, my story
scaring her.

937
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:38,461
She seemed
to understand.

938
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:44,793
No, I swear to god,
every day.

939
00:52:44,795 --> 00:52:46,962
Every day I get an email,
and it's just I'm going,

940
00:52:46,964 --> 00:52:49,965
you know, "what is this?
Is this, like, gonna
kill my hard drive?"

941
00:52:49,967 --> 00:52:53,235
And it's usually some stupid
fricking video of, like--

942
00:52:53,237 --> 00:52:55,171
how many cat videos
has Claire sent you?

943
00:52:55,173 --> 00:52:56,872
- Oh, my god.
- Claire has sent me cat videos

944
00:52:56,874 --> 00:52:59,241
so--every day,
it's a cat video.

945
00:52:59,243 --> 00:53:01,577
I mean,
i got a cat video.
I got a penguin video.

946
00:53:01,579 --> 00:53:04,079
Oh, my god, penguins.
Penguins are overrated.

947
00:53:04,081 --> 00:53:05,881
- Overrated?
- Yeah. Yeah.

948
00:53:05,883 --> 00:53:07,416
- They are.
- Here we go.

949
00:53:07,418 --> 00:53:09,118
- Penguins?
- Yeah, they're happy,

950
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,286
and they're always like,

951
00:53:10,288 --> 00:53:11,854
"oh, my god.
They're so adorable."

952
00:54:01,939 --> 00:54:04,974
<i> You're it.</i>

953
00:54:33,671 --> 00:54:35,271
Kira.

954
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,608
Kira.

955
00:54:40,644 --> 00:54:42,678
Kira.

956
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:04,700
I need help, Tommy.

957
00:55:04,702 --> 00:55:06,635
Oh, what?

958
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:21,510
So things aren't great
with Kira, huh?

959
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:25,214
Heh. What--
why would you say that?

960
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:29,284
Just seems
like that to me.

961
00:56:29,286 --> 00:56:31,320
Seems like
she's real distant.

962
00:56:32,689 --> 00:56:33,856
No.

963
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,191
No, she's great.

964
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:43,065
Should we go
back inside?

965
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:45,300
No. I'm gonna
make a call.

966
00:56:47,837 --> 00:56:49,705
Oh, good luck.

967
00:56:49,707 --> 00:56:51,306
There's no service
up here.

968
00:56:51,308 --> 00:56:53,642
No, it goes in and out.

969
00:56:55,178 --> 00:56:56,712
I could hang with you.

970
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:03,018
You could fuck me
right here.

971
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:04,486
What?

972
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:07,756
Why should we
deny ourselves ever?

973
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:10,359
It's what it was like
in Mexico.

974
00:57:10,361 --> 00:57:12,761
Man, everyone was
just going for it.

975
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:14,396
It was awesome.

976
00:57:16,232 --> 00:57:18,500
I think you need
to go back inside.

977
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,537
You don't like me?

978
00:57:21,539 --> 00:57:22,971
I don't know you.

979
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:26,408
I could make you
like me so much.

980
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:29,812
I could
make you beg me.

981
00:57:31,214 --> 00:57:33,382
Could do it
without even
touching you...

982
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:36,985
Just with
my voice...

983
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:40,322
My breath.

984
00:57:40,324 --> 00:57:41,523
S-Sadie.

985
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,693
You can hurt me
if you want.

986
00:57:46,095 --> 00:57:47,763
I don't want
to hurt you.

987
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:54,036
I don't believe you.

988
00:58:01,678 --> 00:58:04,046
Hey. What are you
doing out here?

989
00:58:06,883 --> 00:58:08,650
I needed a break.

990
00:58:08,652 --> 00:58:10,018
Oh, really?

991
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:12,221
Heh heh. From what?

992
00:58:12,223 --> 00:58:14,957
Tommy, there's
something wrong here.

993
00:58:14,959 --> 00:58:15,824
Will--

994
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:18,126
something bad
is happening here.

995
00:58:18,128 --> 00:58:19,495
You're wrong.

996
00:58:19,497 --> 00:58:21,063
Look, and I know
what you're gonna say,

997
00:58:21,065 --> 00:58:25,033
but Claire left
because that poor girl
is sexually awkward.

998
00:58:25,035 --> 00:58:29,838
Choi is the most
unreliable Korean
in Los Angeles.

999
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:30,906
He could be anywhere.

1000
00:58:30,908 --> 00:58:32,741
And Eden...

1001
00:58:34,711 --> 00:58:36,712
I haven't seen her
for two years.

1002
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:40,482
It's crazy.

1003
00:58:42,485 --> 00:58:44,019
But we're all
trying to figure out

1004
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:45,387
how to go on,
you know.

1005
00:58:46,422 --> 00:58:47,789
This is how they do it.

1006
00:58:47,791 --> 00:58:50,492
Something doesn't
feel safe here.

1007
00:58:50,494 --> 00:58:52,661
Of course
it doesn't feel safe.

1008
00:58:52,663 --> 00:58:54,830
Took a lot of courage
for you to come here tonight,

1009
00:58:54,832 --> 00:58:57,132
but you're letting your mind
run away with things.

1010
00:58:59,669 --> 00:59:01,003
Hey...

1011
00:59:02,138 --> 00:59:03,772
I love you, will.

1012
00:59:06,009 --> 00:59:08,110
But you gotta stop acting
so fucking weird.

1013
00:59:08,112 --> 00:59:10,078
It's freaking people out.

1014
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,990
You're safe, okay?

1015
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:28,163
I'll see you back inside.

1016
00:59:55,658 --> 00:59:58,193
<i> Will, choi.</i>
<i> What's up?</i>

1017
00:59:58,195 --> 00:59:59,561
<i> Listen,</i>
<i> it's about 7:00,</i>

1018
00:59:59,563 --> 01:00:01,163
<i> and I'm pulling up</i>
<i> to Eden's house.</i>

1019
01:00:01,165 --> 01:00:03,532
<i> I forgot to pick up</i>
<i> dessert like I said</i>
<i> I would,</i>

1020
01:00:03,534 --> 01:00:04,866
<i> and I can't</i>
<i> get ahold of Gina.</i>

1021
01:00:04,868 --> 01:00:06,802
<i> Could you get some</i>
<i> on your way? I--</i>

1022
01:00:06,804 --> 01:00:08,837
<i> look,</i>
<i> I'm early, dude.</i>

1023
01:00:08,839 --> 01:00:10,606
<i> I'm actually early,</i>
<i> but honestly</i>

1024
01:00:10,608 --> 01:00:12,474
<i> I don't want to go</i>
<i> back down the hill</i>

1025
01:00:12,476 --> 01:00:14,242
<i> and look</i>
<i> for a fucking</i>
<i> patisserie.</i>

1026
01:00:14,244 --> 01:00:15,577
<i> I hope</i>
<i> you get this.</i>

1027
01:00:15,579 --> 01:00:17,379
<i> See you here</i>
<i> in a few, I guess.</i>

1028
01:00:17,381 --> 01:00:20,048
<i> I'm goin' in.</i>
<i> Okay, bye.</i>

1029
01:00:48,578 --> 01:00:50,245
There he is.

1030
01:00:50,247 --> 01:00:51,913
- See?
- Hey, buddy.

1031
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,483
All right, I want
to play "i want."

1032
01:00:54,485 --> 01:00:56,018
- I want--
- no more blow jobs.

1033
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:58,787
I like this game.
Was it obvious that
i like the game?

1034
01:00:58,789 --> 01:01:00,622
I have room.
I could do it.

1035
01:01:00,624 --> 01:01:03,025
We both enjoyed
that game.

1036
01:01:03,027 --> 01:01:04,226
We did. Heh.

1037
01:01:04,228 --> 01:01:06,628
- Oh.
- Ooh.

1038
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:08,296
I think
this is a new game.

1039
01:01:08,298 --> 01:01:10,565
- I'm scared.
- This is the next game.

1040
01:01:12,403 --> 01:01:15,537
Maybe this is one
of those guess who...

1041
01:01:15,539 --> 01:01:17,239
So pretty.

1042
01:01:17,241 --> 01:01:19,241
- So purty.
- Nice.

1043
01:01:19,243 --> 01:01:20,676
It is lovely.

1044
01:01:20,678 --> 01:01:22,077
Stop it right now.

1045
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:26,081
What is going on here?

1046
01:01:26,083 --> 01:01:27,082
Happy birthday.

1047
01:01:27,084 --> 01:01:28,316
What is this about?

1048
01:01:28,318 --> 01:01:30,619
It's not for another week.

1049
01:01:30,621 --> 01:01:32,554
It's close enough. Mwah.

1050
01:01:32,556 --> 01:01:35,157
- Okay, please, please.
- Come on.

1051
01:01:35,159 --> 01:01:36,158
But no singing.

1052
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,192
- Oh, come on.
- Come on.

1053
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:38,827
Please? Please? Thank you.

1054
01:01:38,829 --> 01:01:40,696
- It's wish time.
- All right.

1055
01:01:40,698 --> 01:01:43,131
Make it good.
Make it good.

1056
01:01:43,133 --> 01:01:44,599
Yeah.

1057
01:01:45,636 --> 01:01:48,103
You attacked
that one.

1058
01:01:48,105 --> 01:01:50,439
- Bastard.
- Well done.

1059
01:01:50,441 --> 01:01:51,907
Where's choi?

1060
01:01:51,909 --> 01:01:52,708
Excuse me?

1061
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:54,543
Where's choi?

1062
01:01:54,545 --> 01:01:55,944
I mean, where the fuck
is choi, hmm?

1063
01:01:55,946 --> 01:01:57,913
What are you
talking about, will?

1064
01:01:57,915 --> 01:01:59,314
I just got
a message from him.

1065
01:01:59,316 --> 01:02:01,783
He said he was here, that he
had gotten here at 7:00.

1066
01:02:01,785 --> 01:02:04,219
- What?
- He said he was here.

1067
01:02:04,221 --> 01:02:05,721
Eden,
is that true?

1068
01:02:05,723 --> 01:02:07,723
I haven't
seen choi tonight.

1069
01:02:07,725 --> 01:02:09,524
Edie, where is he?

1070
01:02:09,526 --> 01:02:10,892
Will, stop, please.
Just--

1071
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:13,595
no. No. I just
got a message from him.

1072
01:02:13,597 --> 01:02:14,796
He said he was here.

1073
01:02:14,798 --> 01:02:17,032
He made the call
from right outside.

1074
01:02:17,034 --> 01:02:19,000
- We haven't seen him.
- Don't fucking lie to me.

1075
01:02:19,002 --> 01:02:20,702
He called
from right outside
your front door.

1076
01:02:20,704 --> 01:02:24,272
David is not
lying to you.
Choi never got here.

1077
01:02:24,274 --> 01:02:25,640
Maybe he
turned around, man.

1078
01:02:25,642 --> 01:02:27,476
Look, he might
have forgotten
something, will.

1079
01:02:27,478 --> 01:02:28,810
You never know.

1080
01:02:28,812 --> 01:02:30,946
Yeah, why is everyone
acting so fucking polite?

1081
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:34,316
Where's choi?

1082
01:02:34,318 --> 01:02:35,851
Hey, Eden,
what's going on?

1083
01:02:35,853 --> 01:02:39,387
I have not seen
choi tonight,
Gina, I swear.

1084
01:02:39,389 --> 01:02:41,556
Something
isn't right here.

1085
01:02:41,558 --> 01:02:44,726
There is something
very strange going on here,

1086
01:02:44,728 --> 01:02:47,028
and no one
is saying anything.

1087
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:48,396
What do you think
is happening, will?

1088
01:02:48,398 --> 01:02:51,032
Hey, who are you? Hmm?

1089
01:02:51,034 --> 01:02:54,636
See, see, I don't get
why you two are here.

1090
01:02:54,638 --> 01:02:57,005
Hey, these are
my guests.

1091
01:02:57,007 --> 01:02:58,106
Yeah. Hmm.

1092
01:02:58,108 --> 01:03:01,576
Two years. We don't
see you for two years,

1093
01:03:01,578 --> 01:03:03,044
and then all of a sudden,

1094
01:03:03,046 --> 01:03:05,347
we get invited
to this lavish dinner.

1095
01:03:05,349 --> 01:03:08,717
You're all smiles,
spewing out all this jargon

1096
01:03:08,719 --> 01:03:10,085
with these two in tow.

1097
01:03:10,087 --> 01:03:12,921
Don't tell me
that this is normal,

1098
01:03:12,923 --> 01:03:15,557
- the invitation.
- It helps people.

1099
01:03:15,559 --> 01:03:16,992
Will, everybody's
allowed to have--

1100
01:03:16,994 --> 01:03:18,894
no, it's a fucking cult,
Miguel!

1101
01:03:18,896 --> 01:03:20,295
It's a fucking cult!

1102
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:21,463
Will, sit down!

1103
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:22,764
No! No, look at
the video, okay?

1104
01:03:22,766 --> 01:03:24,299
It's not about communion.

1105
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:25,934
It's not about family.
It's about fucking denial.

1106
01:03:25,936 --> 01:03:27,202
You are
out of line.

1107
01:03:27,204 --> 01:03:29,004
All right, no,
it's about denial.

1108
01:03:29,006 --> 01:03:32,174
Oh, you know what it is?
It's a fucking brainwash.

1109
01:03:32,176 --> 01:03:36,444
Our son died, Edie,
and you're trying to ignore it.

1110
01:03:36,446 --> 01:03:38,980
It meant something
when he died,

1111
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:41,216
and don't you try
to erase that.

1112
01:03:41,218 --> 01:03:43,485
Ty was real. It was rea--

1113
01:03:43,487 --> 01:03:44,820
it is real.

1114
01:03:45,621 --> 01:03:48,323
Please, please, Edie.

1115
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:56,765
Where's choi?

1116
01:03:56,767 --> 01:03:59,134
Will, she said
she doesn't know.

1117
01:03:59,136 --> 01:04:01,536
I think
this is just a big
misunderstanding.

1118
01:04:01,538 --> 01:04:02,804
Don't fucking
patronize me, David.

1119
01:04:02,806 --> 01:04:04,039
Hey, why don't you
tell me something?

1120
01:04:04,041 --> 01:04:05,507
Why are all the doors
locked, huh?

1121
01:04:05,509 --> 01:04:06,808
Oh, my god.

1122
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:08,844
Okay, why are all the bars
on the windows, hmm?

1123
01:04:08,846 --> 01:04:10,245
Why is there
a big fucking bottle

1124
01:04:10,247 --> 01:04:12,314
of phenobarbital
stashed in your bedroom?

1125
01:04:12,316 --> 01:04:13,481
Jesus Christ, will.

1126
01:04:13,483 --> 01:04:15,383
Did you go through
our things?

1127
01:04:15,385 --> 01:04:17,152
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
We should go.

1128
01:04:17,154 --> 01:04:18,353
- No. No. No.
- We should go.

1129
01:04:18,355 --> 01:04:20,255
Something very dangerous
is going on here,

1130
01:04:20,257 --> 01:04:22,123
and nobody's
talking about it.

1131
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:23,358
We're all
just ignoring it

1132
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:25,527
because David brought out
some good wine!

1133
01:04:25,529 --> 01:04:27,162
We are going, will.
We are going.

1134
01:04:27,164 --> 01:04:28,563
No, I'm not
going anywhere!

1135
01:04:28,565 --> 01:04:30,332
We are going
right now, will.

1136
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:44,713
It's all right.

1137
01:04:44,715 --> 01:04:46,548
All right.

1138
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:49,718
What's up?

1139
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:52,954
Choi?

1140
01:04:53,756 --> 01:04:56,091
I'm so sorry.

1141
01:04:56,093 --> 01:04:58,460
I was right here,
and then work called,

1142
01:04:58,462 --> 01:05:00,328
and it's so fucked up,

1143
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:03,031
'cause they can't do
anything without me.

1144
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:07,402
I called you.

1145
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:08,904
I didn't get it.

1146
01:05:11,307 --> 01:05:13,308
You okay?

1147
01:05:14,877 --> 01:05:17,345
Hi, love.
Did I miss dinner?

1148
01:05:18,547 --> 01:05:19,814
You missed more
than that, bud.

1149
01:05:19,816 --> 01:05:22,050
We have plenty.
I'll get you something.

1150
01:05:22,052 --> 01:05:23,451
I'll fix him
a plate.

1151
01:05:23,453 --> 01:05:25,487
Thank you, pruitt.

1152
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:34,062
What's going on?

1153
01:05:38,401 --> 01:05:39,868
David...

1154
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:43,071
It's okay.

1155
01:05:43,906 --> 01:05:46,207
We really should
go now, will.

1156
01:05:46,209 --> 01:05:49,044
Just give him
a minute, Kira.

1157
01:05:51,547 --> 01:05:55,016
I'm--I'm sorry, Eden.

1158
01:05:55,018 --> 01:05:57,686
I know it's hard, will,

1159
01:05:57,688 --> 01:05:59,354
but you
can't criticize us

1160
01:05:59,356 --> 01:06:01,089
for finding our own way
through this.

1161
01:06:01,091 --> 01:06:03,058
I've never done that
to you.

1162
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:05,560
I know. I know.
It's none of my business.

1163
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:08,730
I know,

1164
01:06:08,732 --> 01:06:10,966
and I'm very sorry.

1165
01:06:10,968 --> 01:06:12,867
It's okay.

1166
01:06:12,869 --> 01:06:14,336
It's okay.

1167
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:17,205
You're part
of our family, will.

1168
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:21,242
All of you are.

1169
01:06:30,252 --> 01:06:33,254
Will you--will you
excuse me for a second?

1170
01:06:37,626 --> 01:06:41,029
Choi, eat.

1171
01:06:44,066 --> 01:06:46,935
You--you got
any more of that wine?

1172
01:07:00,816 --> 01:07:03,018
Just gotta lather it up.

1173
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:06,988
Keep washing.

1174
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:10,425
10 seconds,
at least.

1175
01:07:36,852 --> 01:07:38,920
We should go.

1176
01:07:38,922 --> 01:07:40,288
Let's go, then.
Let's just--

1177
01:07:40,290 --> 01:07:41,656
let's just
get out of here.

1178
01:07:41,658 --> 01:07:42,657
I can't.

1179
01:07:42,659 --> 01:07:45,026
Kira, I'm not okay.

1180
01:07:46,328 --> 01:07:48,129
My son is dead.

1181
01:07:48,131 --> 01:07:50,398
Where do I put that?

1182
01:07:53,335 --> 01:07:54,669
I don't know.

1183
01:07:57,840 --> 01:08:01,676
It's like a scream
trapped inside me.

1184
01:08:03,879 --> 01:08:07,782
And nothing
changes the fact

1185
01:08:07,784 --> 01:08:09,451
that I should have--

1186
01:08:09,453 --> 01:08:11,419
I should have
been watching
more closely that day.

1187
01:08:11,421 --> 01:08:13,188
Now, look, you couldn't
have known, will.

1188
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:15,123
You could not have been
looking out for that.

1189
01:08:15,125 --> 01:08:16,524
It's another kid.

1190
01:08:19,495 --> 01:08:22,330
And Ty loved him.

1191
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:24,799
And they were
just playing.

1192
01:08:24,801 --> 01:08:26,568
They were
just messing around.

1193
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:28,503
I shouldn't have
let them have the bat.

1194
01:08:28,505 --> 01:08:29,904
What happened to your son

1195
01:08:29,906 --> 01:08:35,310
wasn't anything
that could be predicted
or changed or...

1196
01:08:35,312 --> 01:08:38,179
I've been waiting to die
since the moment
it happened.

1197
01:08:52,528 --> 01:08:56,531
Moving forward
is not a betrayal, will.

1198
01:08:56,533 --> 01:08:58,833
Look at Eden.

1199
01:08:58,835 --> 01:09:00,702
That's what
letting go looks like.

1200
01:09:00,704 --> 01:09:01,903
You're not
letting go of him.

1201
01:09:01,905 --> 01:09:04,973
I would never ask you to.
You know that.

1202
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:08,076
We can help
each other, will.

1203
01:09:08,078 --> 01:09:10,945
That's the only way.

1204
01:09:10,947 --> 01:09:12,981
I love you, Kira...

1205
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:16,684
But I don't think
you can help me.

1206
01:09:28,731 --> 01:09:29,731
I'm sorry.

1207
01:09:29,733 --> 01:09:31,232
Yeah, you are.

1208
01:09:46,582 --> 01:09:48,816
Mmm. Red velvet.

1209
01:09:48,818 --> 01:09:51,152
Miguel, you get
the first piece.

1210
01:09:51,154 --> 01:09:52,353
I'm excited.

1211
01:09:57,493 --> 01:09:59,294
Hi, will.

1212
01:10:02,831 --> 01:10:05,166
Can I see his room?

1213
01:10:10,839 --> 01:10:12,307
Of course.

1214
01:14:02,471 --> 01:14:04,705
<i>I know you have doubts.</i>

1215
01:14:07,409 --> 01:14:10,478
<i>Skepticism</i>
<i>can be contagious.</i>

1216
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,413
<i> I wouldn't</i>
<i> have known either</i>

1217
01:14:12,415 --> 01:14:16,050
<i>before I saw the new truth</i>
<i>and shared it with you.</i>

1218
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:18,619
<i>I wouldn't have believed,</i>

1219
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:20,988
<i> but it was revealed</i>
<i> so clearly.</i>

1220
01:14:22,024 --> 01:14:23,724
<i> Remember the reward.</i>

1221
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:27,929
<i>This beautiful moment</i>
<i>is upon us.</i>

1222
01:14:27,931 --> 01:14:31,999
<i>Tonight is the night</i>
<i>our faith is made real.</i>

1223
01:14:33,402 --> 01:14:36,504
<i> The hardest thing</i>
<i> is to start.</i>

1224
01:14:36,506 --> 01:14:39,740
<i> Just take the step.</i>

1225
01:14:39,742 --> 01:14:44,879
<i>Believe,</i>
<i>and give yourself over.</i>

1226
01:14:46,549 --> 01:14:49,016
Will, let's go.
Everybody's waiting.

1227
01:14:49,018 --> 01:14:50,618
<i> I love you.</i>

1228
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:54,889
<i>I love you so much,</i>
<i>my heart is breaking.</i>

1229
01:14:54,891 --> 01:14:56,924
<i> I'm waiting for you.</i>

1230
01:15:11,907 --> 01:15:13,541
Okay.

1231
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:45,006
Kira.

1232
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:51,439
Look at these people.

1233
01:16:52,474 --> 01:16:55,076
They're so happy
to be here with you.

1234
01:16:57,846 --> 01:16:59,547
I think
we should take a moment

1235
01:16:59,549 --> 01:17:02,016
to look at each other
and really look.

1236
01:17:05,420 --> 01:17:07,121
Please raise your glass.

1237
01:17:11,093 --> 01:17:13,628
To a better world.

1238
01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:16,697
To peace.

1239
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:19,367
Cheers.

1240
01:17:19,369 --> 01:17:21,502
Cheers.

1241
01:17:21,504 --> 01:17:23,137
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1242
01:17:23,139 --> 01:17:25,039
Don't drink it!
Don't fucking touch it!

1243
01:17:25,041 --> 01:17:26,707
- No! No!

1244
01:17:26,709 --> 01:17:28,743
- Will!
- No, don't drink!

1245
01:17:28,745 --> 01:17:30,578
- Don't drink!
- Calm down, will.

1246
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:32,480
No. No.
We are leaving now!

1247
01:17:32,482 --> 01:17:34,215
- Control yourself.
- Will, you do not
want to go this way.

1248
01:17:34,217 --> 01:17:36,751
Let's go, Kira.
We're leaving
right now!

1249
01:17:36,753 --> 01:17:38,619
- Calm down.
- No, we are leaving now!

1250
01:17:38,621 --> 01:17:41,055
You ruined it!
You ruined everything!

1251
01:17:45,293 --> 01:17:46,961
Oh, my god.

1252
01:17:49,131 --> 01:17:50,998
Oh, my god.

1253
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:51,999
Sadie.

1254
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:54,702
Sadie.

1255
01:17:55,837 --> 01:17:57,271
- Sadie.
- Oh, my god, will.

1256
01:17:57,273 --> 01:17:58,272
What did you do?

1257
01:18:00,008 --> 01:18:01,042
Don't move her.

1258
01:18:02,577 --> 01:18:04,879
Sadie.
Somebody call 911.

1259
01:18:04,881 --> 01:18:07,348
- I'm on it.
- Sadie.

1260
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:08,683
Sadie, can you hear me?

1261
01:18:09,752 --> 01:18:11,686
Do you have
a first-aid kit?

1262
01:18:12,587 --> 01:18:14,422
Sadie,
can you hear me?

1263
01:18:14,424 --> 01:18:15,823
It's okay, Sadie.

1264
01:18:15,825 --> 01:18:17,825
- She's not breathing.
- No, she's breathing.

1265
01:18:17,827 --> 01:18:19,927
- Not Sadie, Gina.
- What?

1266
01:18:19,929 --> 01:18:21,629
Gina?

1267
01:18:22,731 --> 01:18:25,499
All right, get her
to the floor.

1268
01:18:25,501 --> 01:18:26,500
Gina.

1269
01:18:26,502 --> 01:18:28,135
What's going on? Gina!

1270
01:18:29,137 --> 01:18:30,538
- Baby?
- Gina.

1271
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:31,906
- Gina.
- Gina.

1272
01:18:31,908 --> 01:18:33,107
- Can you hear me?
- Baby?

1273
01:18:33,109 --> 01:18:34,909
Starting cpr.

1274
01:18:37,412 --> 01:18:39,613
Baby, it's gonna be okay.

1275
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:41,582
- What's happening, Miguel?
- Somebody get 911?

1276
01:18:41,584 --> 01:18:42,817
I'm not getting
any reception.

1277
01:18:42,819 --> 01:18:45,352
I'm not getting
a pulse, Miguel.

1278
01:18:45,354 --> 01:18:46,987
Fucking door's locked.

1279
01:18:46,989 --> 01:18:48,355
- Gina, can you hear me?
- Gina.

1280
01:18:48,357 --> 01:18:50,357
- Come on, Gina.
- Okay, baby.

1281
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:06,834
Come on.
Go. Go. Go. Go. Go.

1282
01:20:07,702 --> 01:20:09,703
- Tommy. Tom--Tommy.

1283
01:20:09,705 --> 01:20:11,205
Come on! Let's go!

1284
01:20:11,207 --> 01:20:12,406
Tommy!

1285
01:20:19,848 --> 01:20:20,848
- Come on!
- Kira! Kira!

1286
01:20:20,850 --> 01:20:22,049
- This way.
- What?!

1287
01:20:22,051 --> 01:20:23,984
Ben, this way!

1288
01:20:23,986 --> 01:20:25,553
- Oh, my god.
- Go left. Left!

1289
01:20:25,555 --> 01:20:27,855
Oh. It's locked.

1290
01:20:27,857 --> 01:20:29,690
Will, it's locked.

1291
01:20:29,692 --> 01:20:31,525
Okay, okay.
This way. This way.

1292
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:39,133
Will! Will!

1293
01:20:52,815 --> 01:20:55,382
The door. The door.

1294
01:21:00,355 --> 01:21:01,922
Fuck. It's locked.

1295
01:21:01,924 --> 01:21:04,024
We're gonna have
to break it.

1296
01:21:05,328 --> 01:21:07,828
Shh. Kira.

1297
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:26,146
- No.
- - Please, no.

1298
01:21:37,092 --> 01:21:38,726
Will, why is
this happening?

1299
01:21:38,728 --> 01:21:41,028
Listen to me.
We are gonna get ready.

1300
01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:42,830
We're gonna do
whatever it takes.

1301
01:21:42,832 --> 01:21:44,832
Do you hear me?

1302
01:21:44,834 --> 01:21:46,767
- They are just people.
- Right.

1303
01:21:46,769 --> 01:21:48,369
- Okay?
- Okay.

1304
01:21:52,307 --> 01:21:53,741
- Okay?
- Okay.

1305
01:21:54,542 --> 01:21:56,210
- Come on.
- Okay.

1306
01:22:12,193 --> 01:22:13,527
Okay.

1307
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:47,962
You weren't
supposed to hurt
anybody like that.

1308
01:22:47,964 --> 01:22:49,697
I know.

1309
01:22:55,570 --> 01:22:58,038
- Oh, god.
- How could you do that?

1310
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:00,607
- Why would you do that?
- Don't do this.

1311
01:23:00,609 --> 01:23:04,311
We were supposed
to just go to sleep
and go there together.

1312
01:23:04,313 --> 01:23:06,246
It was supposed
to be beautiful.

1313
01:23:06,248 --> 01:23:08,482
It's gonna be quiet
in a minute.

1314
01:23:08,484 --> 01:23:09,650
We'll be there soon.

1315
01:23:09,652 --> 01:23:11,251
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

1316
01:23:11,253 --> 01:23:13,854
- That's not what he said.
- No, I know. It's just...

1317
01:23:13,856 --> 01:23:15,756
We just have
to finish now. Hey.

1318
01:23:15,758 --> 01:23:17,024
Listen to me.

1319
01:23:17,026 --> 01:23:19,393
We take it
one step at a time.
We finish.

1320
01:23:19,395 --> 01:23:20,961
- No. I can't.
- It'll be quiet,

1321
01:23:20,963 --> 01:23:22,629
and we can rest.
Yes, you can.

1322
01:23:22,631 --> 01:23:24,365
Eden,
you gotta help me.

1323
01:23:24,367 --> 01:23:25,899
You have to help me.
You can't leave me.

1324
01:23:25,901 --> 01:23:27,801
No, this is wrong.

1325
01:23:27,803 --> 01:23:30,170
Dr. Joseph said it
was gonna be hard,

1326
01:23:30,172 --> 01:23:32,573
but we'll have
to finish it now.

1327
01:23:32,575 --> 01:23:34,108
This is wrong.

1328
01:23:34,110 --> 01:23:35,843
We were chosen,
remember?

1329
01:23:35,845 --> 01:23:37,745
We were chosen.
This is the only way

1330
01:23:37,747 --> 01:23:38,846
we can leave
this hurting.

1331
01:23:38,848 --> 01:23:40,247
This is right.

1332
01:23:40,249 --> 01:23:43,784
This is the only way
we can stop hurting.

1333
01:23:43,786 --> 01:23:46,820
We can
leave all this,
all this pain,

1334
01:23:46,822 --> 01:23:49,490
all this shit
behind.

1335
01:23:49,492 --> 01:23:50,858
You can do this.

1336
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:53,260
Hey...

1337
01:23:54,662 --> 01:23:56,463
We can still
get there.

1338
01:24:00,301 --> 01:24:01,635
Come on.

1339
01:24:03,671 --> 01:24:05,539
Come on.

1340
01:24:33,935 --> 01:24:35,903
There's a door

1341
01:24:35,905 --> 01:24:38,038
- to the garage upstairs.
- Okay.

1342
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:39,406
We're going there.

1343
01:24:39,408 --> 01:24:40,407
Okay.

1344
01:24:51,687 --> 01:24:54,955
Shh. Shh.

1345
01:25:15,176 --> 01:25:16,844
Dr. Joseph...

1346
01:26:12,901 --> 01:26:13,901
Oh, my god.

1347
01:26:13,903 --> 01:26:14,935
Choi.

1348
01:26:14,937 --> 01:26:16,970
Oh, my god.

1349
01:26:16,972 --> 01:26:18,172
Oh, god.

1350
01:26:26,314 --> 01:26:27,581
No.

1351
01:26:27,583 --> 01:26:28,582
What?

1352
01:26:28,584 --> 01:26:30,284
- No.
- What?

1353
01:26:32,353 --> 01:26:35,722
No. No. There was
a door here.

1354
01:26:35,724 --> 01:26:37,558
Oh, fuck.

1355
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:39,393
We had a door here
when we lived here.

1356
01:26:39,395 --> 01:26:41,562
Fuck. Okay.

1357
01:26:41,564 --> 01:26:43,530
Okay, maybe--

1358
01:26:43,532 --> 01:26:45,032
maybe we can signal
someone outside.

1359
01:26:45,034 --> 01:26:48,068
Maybe I can signal
someone outside.

1360
01:26:48,070 --> 01:26:49,836
Come on.

1361
01:26:49,838 --> 01:26:50,837
Kira.

1362
01:26:50,839 --> 01:26:52,339
Shh.

1363
01:26:52,341 --> 01:26:54,775
Shh.

1364
01:26:54,777 --> 01:26:55,776
Kira.

1365
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:46,360
Don't be afraid.

1366
01:27:47,328 --> 01:27:50,797
There is a plan
for us, man.

1367
01:27:50,799 --> 01:27:51,798
Will.

1368
01:27:54,969 --> 01:27:57,271
Just let go. Just--

1369
01:28:00,074 --> 01:28:02,442
we'll be there soon.

1370
01:28:03,444 --> 01:28:04,878
I promise.

1371
01:28:43,785 --> 01:28:45,252
Come on.

1372
01:28:45,254 --> 01:28:46,853
Let's get out of here.

1373
01:28:58,733 --> 01:28:59,733
Eden.

1374
01:29:02,904 --> 01:29:04,871
I'm sorry, will.

1375
01:29:04,873 --> 01:29:06,606
I'm sorry, will.

1376
01:29:06,608 --> 01:29:07,708
I'm sorry.

1377
01:29:08,776 --> 01:29:10,811
I'm sorry.

1378
01:29:10,813 --> 01:29:11,812
Eden.

1379
01:29:22,457 --> 01:29:25,392
Stop it. Stop it.
Stop it.

1380
01:29:36,738 --> 01:29:38,472
Okay.

1381
01:29:42,610 --> 01:29:43,744
Will.

1382
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:47,881
We are not
gonna die like this.

1383
01:29:47,883 --> 01:29:50,717
Hey, lis--

1384
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:52,619
I'm okay.

1385
01:29:52,621 --> 01:29:54,321
Eden?

1386
01:29:54,323 --> 01:29:56,390
Get the gun.

1387
01:29:59,861 --> 01:30:01,661
Eden?

1388
01:30:03,131 --> 01:30:05,766
She shot herself, David.

1389
01:30:08,102 --> 01:30:09,569
That's good.

1390
01:30:10,371 --> 01:30:11,705
She's with them now.

1391
01:30:17,412 --> 01:30:18,945
It's empty.

1392
01:30:22,850 --> 01:30:24,418
We have a gun.

1393
01:30:25,553 --> 01:30:26,787
That's okay.

1394
01:30:30,291 --> 01:30:31,858
It's time.

1395
01:30:33,494 --> 01:30:34,895
Don't do this,
David.

1396
01:31:36,190 --> 01:31:37,924
Will.

1397
01:32:00,748 --> 01:32:02,749
I miss him.

1398
01:32:05,586 --> 01:32:08,488
I miss him so much.

1399
01:32:13,794 --> 01:32:16,229
I wanted to leave.

1400
01:32:22,803 --> 01:32:25,105
I'm sorry.

1401
01:32:32,446 --> 01:32:36,016
Will you
take me outside?

1402
01:33:10,117 --> 01:33:11,551
I hope...

1403
01:33:13,754 --> 01:33:15,622
I hope we...

1404
01:34:05,239 --> 01:34:06,706
I, uh...

1405
01:34:08,309 --> 01:34:10,410
I gotta go
get Miguel.

1406
01:34:10,412 --> 01:34:12,045
Tommy.

1407
01:34:24,091 --> 01:34:25,525
Okay.

1408
01:35:13,642 --> 01:35:15,842
Oh, my god.

1409
01:35:25,854 --> 01:35:27,754
Kira.
