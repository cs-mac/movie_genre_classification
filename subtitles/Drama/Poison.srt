1
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:18,099
Police! Open up!

2
00:00:19,099 --> 00:00:21,099
Police, ma'am! Hello?

3
00:00:22,099 --> 00:00:25,099
Open up! Come on! Come on. Open up.

4
00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:30,099
Hello?

5
00:00:36,099 --> 00:00:38,099
Miss Olsen, are you there?

6
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,098
We will have to make a forced entry...

7
00:00:40,099 --> 00:00:43,099
if you refuse or are unable to open up!

8
00:00:44,099 --> 00:00:47,099
Nancy Olsen!

9
00:00:48,099 --> 00:00:50,099
Open up! Come on!

10
00:00:51,099 --> 00:00:53,099
The door down the hall.

11
00:01:01,099 --> 00:01:02,099
My God!

12
00:01:03,099 --> 00:01:04,099
How awful!

13
00:01:07,099 --> 00:01:09,098
Look!

14
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:12,099
He went out there! Get him!

15
00:01:25,099 --> 00:01:27,098
On June 3, 1985...

16
00:01:27,099 --> 00:01:31,098
at approximately 5:58 a.m.,

17
00:01:31,099 --> 00:01:34,098
Richard Beacon, a
seven-year-old Long Island boy,

18
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:38,098
shot and killed his father
in a heated family argument.

19
00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:42,098
Felicia Beacon, the boy's
mother, astonishingly claims...

20
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:46,099
she then saw her son take off in
flight from the patio balcony.

21
00:01:48,099 --> 00:01:51,098
What really happened the night of June 3?

22
00:01:51,099 --> 00:01:54,099
Who was Richie Beacon, and where is he now?

23
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:32,098
In '44,

24
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:36,098
I was sent to Fontenal Prison
on several counts of theft.

25
00:05:36,099 --> 00:05:37,098
Name?

26
00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:39,098
Broom.

27
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:41,099
First? John.

28
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:45,098
Age?

29
00:05:45,099 --> 00:05:47,098
Thirty-one.

30
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:48,099
Date of birth?

31
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:54,099
October 29, 1913.

32
00:05:55,099 --> 00:05:58,098
Orphan? Yes.

33
00:05:58,099 --> 00:05:59,099
Where?

34
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:02,098
First...

35
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:05,098
Prison was not new to me. I'd
lived in them all my life.

36
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:07,098
Various foster homes.

37
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:11,098
In submitting to prison life, embracing it,

38
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:13,098
I could reject the world
that had rejected me.

39
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:18,098
The sexual behavior, which includes...

40
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:19,099
Hold him! Males...

41
00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:22,098
Is that correct? What?

42
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:24,099
I will bash your fucking skull in!

43
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:29,098
The state obliges us to,

44
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:33,099
inquire as to whether or
not you engaged in the...

45
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:37,098
practice of...

46
00:06:37,099 --> 00:06:39,098
that you practiced...

47
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:41,098
Yeah.

48
00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:42,099
Whatever.

49
00:06:55,099 --> 00:06:58,099
That word there, is it
written as two words?

50
00:07:28,099 --> 00:07:30,098
We're gathered here today...

51
00:07:30,099 --> 00:07:34,098
in the shadow cast by the
penal preserve of Baton...

52
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:37,098
by the trusty and loyal inmates,

53
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:40,098
Harold van Roven and John Broom,

54
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:42,098
who hereby pledge to one another...

55
00:07:42,099 --> 00:07:46,098
in the eyes of their comrades and
fellows in misery...

56
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:50,098
their loyalty and faith to
one northerly’s and soul.

57
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:52,098
The ring upon each man's finger...

58
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:55,098
will prove to them and
those in their company...

59
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:59,098
that each is betrothed to the
other for life and to love...

60
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:01,099
till death do come.

61
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:04,099
Place the rings on each finger.

62
00:08:07,099 --> 00:08:10,098
Pledge to truth and faith...

63
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:13,099
above and beyond God, the oppressor.

64
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:46,098
Ever since he was a child,

65
00:08:46,099 --> 00:08:50,099
Thomas Graves had been
hungry for knowledge.

66
00:08:52,099 --> 00:08:56,099
Hungry to discover all the
secrets of the universe.

67
00:08:59,099 --> 00:09:01,098
Science...

68
00:09:01,099 --> 00:09:04,098
man's sacred quest for truth...

69
00:09:04,099 --> 00:09:07,099
was his first and only love.

70
00:09:10,099 --> 00:09:12,098
Years of hard work and research...

71
00:09:12,099 --> 00:09:16,098
led him to the mysteries
of the sex drive...

72
00:09:16,099 --> 00:09:20,099
and its potential for the
betterment of mankind.

73
00:09:23,099 --> 00:09:26,098
At the age of 32,

74
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:28,098
Dr. Thomas Graves was called upon...

75
00:09:28,099 --> 00:09:33,098
to present his theories
to experts in his field.

76
00:09:33,099 --> 00:09:36,098
And thus, as I have demonstrated,

77
00:09:36,099 --> 00:09:38,098
I have determined that once extracted...

78
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:41,098
the application of the
hormonal equivalent...

79
00:09:41,099 --> 00:09:44,098
of the sexual instinct to
practical neurology...

80
00:09:44,099 --> 00:09:49,098
will not only provoke a dramatic
reassessment of geriatric research...

81
00:09:49,099 --> 00:09:52,099
but will end paralysis as we know it today.

82
00:09:53,099 --> 00:09:55,099
Thank you.

83
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:00,098
Why, this is ridiculous!

84
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:05,099
I ask you, are we to
take this charade seriously?

85
00:10:06,099 --> 00:10:09,098
I demand that this man be reexamined...

86
00:10:09,099 --> 00:10:12,098
by the panel on grounds of
medical incompetence!

87
00:10:12,099 --> 00:10:13,099
I agree.

88
00:10:44,099 --> 00:10:45,642
That's it.

89
00:10:46,099 --> 00:10:50,098
It's putrefacted condensation sustained,

90
00:10:50,099 --> 00:10:53,098
allowing molecular
coagulation by producing...

91
00:10:53,099 --> 00:10:57,098
bio magnetic gas.

92
00:10:57,099 --> 00:10:59,098
I did it. I did it.

93
00:10:59,099 --> 00:11:02,098
Dr. Graves? Yes. I'm Dr. Graves.

94
00:11:02,099 --> 00:11:04,098
And I've just captured the sex drive.

95
00:11:04,099 --> 00:11:06,098
That's marvelous.

96
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:09,098
It means the molecular coagulation
theory holds true.

97
00:11:09,099 --> 00:11:12,098
Molecular coag...

98
00:11:12,099 --> 00:11:16,098
How do you know that? Who are you?

99
00:11:16,099 --> 00:11:18,098
I'm Dr. Olsen.- Who?

100
00:11:18,099 --> 00:11:22,098
Dr. Olsen. Nancy Olsen?

101
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:24,098
From Boston?

102
00:11:24,099 --> 00:11:26,098
Dr. Strick recommended
me to you regarding...

103
00:11:26,099 --> 00:11:28,098
You're...

104
00:11:28,099 --> 00:11:30,099
I... I didn't expect a woman.

105
00:11:32,099 --> 00:11:35,098
I didn't expect you to.

106
00:11:35,099 --> 00:11:38,098
I've been following your
work for years, Doctor.

107
00:11:38,099 --> 00:11:42,098
Ever since Evaluations of Molecular
Sustention of Hormonal Conductivity...

108
00:11:42,099 --> 00:11:44,098
appeared in the science journal at MIT.

109
00:11:44,099 --> 00:11:48,098
Your discovery of the white cellular
clotting predominance in neurasthenia...

110
00:11:48,099 --> 00:11:51,098
completely altered my understanding of...

111
00:11:51,099 --> 00:11:53,099
conditional bioflavonoid neuropathology.

112
00:11:55,099 --> 00:11:58,098
I wrote my doctoral thesis on your
molecular coagulation theory,

113
00:11:58,099 --> 00:12:01,098
and I'm now a hormonal specialist.

114
00:12:01,099 --> 00:12:03,098
I've come here with the
hopes of assisting you.

115
00:12:03,099 --> 00:12:05,099
Well, how do you do?

116
00:12:06,099 --> 00:12:07,259
Very well, Doctor. Thank you.

117
00:12:11,099 --> 00:12:13,098
And now I really should leave
you to record your success.

118
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:17,098
But, please, feel free to call
on me anytime that you need.

119
00:12:17,099 --> 00:12:19,099
And congratulations, Doctor.

120
00:12:20,099 --> 00:12:22,099
You're making medical history.

121
00:13:01,099 --> 00:13:03,098
Molecular coagulation...

122
00:13:03,099 --> 00:13:05,099
conditional bioflavonoid neuropathology.

123
00:13:08,099 --> 00:13:11,098
Evaluations of Molecular
Sustention of Hormonal Conductivity...

124
00:13:11,099 --> 00:13:13,098
appeared in the science journal at MIT.

125
00:13:13,099 --> 00:13:15,098
Putrefacted condensation sustained...

126
00:13:15,099 --> 00:13:18,099
You're making medical history.

127
00:13:49,099 --> 00:13:52,098
The quiet residential
community of Glenville...

128
00:13:52,099 --> 00:13:56,098
was stunned to learn of the
strange death of Fred Beacon.

129
00:13:56,099 --> 00:13:58,098
It gave everybody the creeps.

130
00:13:58,099 --> 00:14:01,098
All the neighbors were afraid
to come out their door.

131
00:14:01,099 --> 00:14:03,559
It was absolutely...

132
00:14:04,099 --> 00:14:06,098
the most dreadful thing I have experienced...

133
00:14:06,099 --> 00:14:08,099
in my entire lifetime. It was awful.

134
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:11,098
It was terrible.

135
00:14:11,099 --> 00:14:14,098
You know, I heard every shot.

136
00:14:14,099 --> 00:14:17,098
You never know who your friends
are. I heard every single shot.

137
00:14:17,099 --> 00:14:20,098
You think you know people, but
you really don’t know them...

138
00:14:20,099 --> 00:14:21,299
and you live next door to them.

139
00:14:22,099 --> 00:14:23,098
You don't, till something like this happens.

140
00:14:23,099 --> 00:14:26,098
Richie Beacon's disappearance provoked...

141
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:29,099
one of the toughest missing person
investigations in Long Island history.

142
00:14:29,225 --> 00:14:32,099
Whole thing lasted at least a year.

143
00:14:33,099 --> 00:14:35,099
His face is still on milk cartons.

144
00:14:36,099 --> 00:14:37,098
What was found?

145
00:14:37,099 --> 00:14:39,098
Nothing.

146
00:14:39,099 --> 00:14:43,098
Felicia Beacon became the center
of Glenville controversy...

147
00:14:43,099 --> 00:14:47,099
following her extraordinary account
of her son's disappearance.

148
00:14:48,099 --> 00:14:51,098
I guess I just didn't...

149
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:55,099
I definitely didn’t know what he was.

150
00:14:56,099 --> 00:14:59,098
I mean, I punished him.

151
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:01,099
His father hit him, just like any kid.

152
00:15:02,099 --> 00:15:06,098
But I definitely didn’t realize...

153
00:15:06,099 --> 00:15:08,098
Realize what?

154
00:15:08,099 --> 00:15:10,099
That he was a gift from God.

155
00:15:18,099 --> 00:15:21,098
By the time I was 16 years old,

156
00:15:21,099 --> 00:15:25,099
I was notorious as a kid with
a terrific knack for theft.

157
00:15:26,099 --> 00:15:29,098
Foster homes would no longer take me,

158
00:15:29,099 --> 00:15:32,099
and I was sent to the Boys'
Reformatory of Baton.

159
00:15:35,099 --> 00:15:38,098
There, in the counterfeit
world of men among men...

160
00:15:38,099 --> 00:15:39,099
Down! Three!

161
00:15:40,099 --> 00:15:42,098
I found my true family. Four!

162
00:15:42,099 --> 00:15:43,099
Halt!

163
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:48,098
Step to the left! At Baton, I was
astounded by the discovery...

164
00:15:48,099 --> 00:15:52,098
Step to the right! That each
male had a male of his own.

165
00:15:52,099 --> 00:15:56,098
Step to the right! And that the
world of force and manly beauty...

166
00:15:56,099 --> 00:16:00,098
loved in that way within itself...

167
00:16:00,099 --> 00:16:02,098
from link to link.

168
00:16:02,099 --> 00:16:04,099
Down! Five!

169
00:16:16,099 --> 00:16:20,098
It was from then on, when
they merged in shadow,

170
00:16:20,099 --> 00:16:23,099
that each group offered me a puzzle.

171
00:16:25,099 --> 00:16:30,099
The stiff, silent males
possessed the violence of love.

172
00:16:31,099 --> 00:16:33,099
And my life's study...

173
00:16:35,099 --> 00:16:36,099
would be to find it.

174
00:16:43,099 --> 00:16:45,098
Sixteen years had passed...

175
00:16:45,099 --> 00:16:48,099
when the maximum security
prison of Fontenal...

176
00:16:49,099 --> 00:16:52,099
brought me face-to-face
with my deliverance.

177
00:16:54,099 --> 00:16:58,098
Jack Bolton. Age 28.

178
00:16:58,099 --> 00:17:00,098
175 pounds.

179
00:17:00,099 --> 00:17:03,098
Seventy-five inches.

180
00:17:03,099 --> 00:17:07,099
Formerly a captive of Baton.

181
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:10,099
Poor kid!

182
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:16,098
Somebody up there knows. Come on, pussy!

183
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:18,099
You know what? You make me want to puke!

184
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:26,098
You want to suck it, bitch? When
was the last time you saw rock?

185
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:29,098
You want to suck it! You
want to crawl for it!

186
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:32,098
Yes, you do!

187
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:33,099
Is it Jack Bolton?

188
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:37,099
You hear that? Pussy!

189
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,098
Canon!

190
00:17:40,099 --> 00:17:42,099
Here?

191
00:17:43,099 --> 00:17:45,099
Since today.

192
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,098
Coyle, Jack Bolton.

193
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:52,098
Hey, John. A friend of mine, man.

194
00:17:52,099 --> 00:17:57,099
You make me want to puke!-
Jack Bolton, Johnny Broom.

195
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:01,098
Baton? Yeah. Yeah.

196
00:18:01,099 --> 00:18:03,099
I knew it.

197
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:10,098
You swallow it by the
mouthful, don't you, Birdy?

198
00:18:10,099 --> 00:18:12,098
Jism by the jug, right?

199
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:15,098
You want it real bad, don't you, punk?

200
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:17,098
Don't you, slug? Don't you, pretty boy?

201
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:19,099
Hey, you! Shine!

202
00:18:22,099 --> 00:18:24,099
Annoying Mr. Rass?

203
00:18:25,099 --> 00:18:27,099
Not me, chief.

204
00:18:42,099 --> 00:18:44,099
That's a good boy.

205
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:46,099
That's a smart little fag.

206
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:51,099
Think fast, faggot!

207
00:18:52,099 --> 00:18:55,098
You want it real bad, don't you? Don't you?

208
00:18:55,099 --> 00:18:58,098
You want me to shoot it up your hole.
Is that it?

209
00:19:00,099 --> 00:19:03,099
Go on. Marry him. You know you love him.

210
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,099
What? Me marry him?

211
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:42,099
How's the wife shaking?
Keeping you out of trouble?

212
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:45,099
You gotta be kidding.

213
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:54,099
Looking like a dream. A bad dream.

214
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:00,220
What do you say, angel-puss?

215
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:41,098
Richie was a complicated boy.

216
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:44,098
On the one hand, very intelligent,

217
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:46,098
but at the same time,

218
00:21:46,099 --> 00:21:49,099
withdrawn.

219
00:21:51,099 --> 00:21:54,098
What's really strange, though, was,

220
00:21:54,099 --> 00:21:58,099
the amount of animosity he would induce...

221
00:21:58,851 --> 00:22:01,098
in the other children... out of nowhere.

222
00:22:01,099 --> 00:22:04,098
Like this one kid, Brad. Yeah.

223
00:22:04,099 --> 00:22:06,098
He started hitting him... Yeah.

224
00:22:06,099 --> 00:22:10,098
'Cause he didn't believe that he was
really a prince and his dad was a king.

225
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:13,098
The weird thing was that
Richie didn’t fight back.

226
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:15,098
He just sat there until... He just
sat there until the teacher came.

227
00:22:15,099 --> 00:22:17,098
And he was all bloody.

228
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:19,099
He was a perfect child.

229
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:22,099
A perfect baby.

230
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:25,098
Very independent.

231
00:22:25,099 --> 00:22:26,099
Very smart.

232
00:22:28,099 --> 00:22:29,099
Never fussed.

233
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:34,099
He always kept himself
busy with stories and coloring.

234
00:22:36,099 --> 00:22:40,098
He was always doing these private things.

235
00:22:40,099 --> 00:22:42,099
Private games.

236
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:47,099
All right, keep it moving.
There's no rec for today.

237
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,099
All inmates proceed directly to shop.

238
00:22:57,099 --> 00:23:01,098
All inmates proceed directly to shop.
No rec today.

239
00:23:01,099 --> 00:23:02,099
Move it along.

240
00:23:06,099 --> 00:23:09,099
A trip to the brig, Gecko? Is that
what you want? Move it along!

241
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:19,098
Would you fuckin' pigs shut up?

242
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:21,099
Thanks a lot, man. Forget it.

243
00:23:23,099 --> 00:23:24,099
Guy from Baton.

244
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:27,098
It's loyalty.

245
00:23:27,099 --> 00:23:30,098
Man, to a shithole. Maybe.

246
00:23:30,099 --> 00:23:32,098
Better than this one.

247
00:23:32,099 --> 00:23:33,099
No way, man.

248
00:23:34,099 --> 00:23:37,098
The guys are... They're
straight with you here, you know?

249
00:23:37,099 --> 00:23:39,099
You know what's what.

250
00:23:40,099 --> 00:23:42,099
Don't be too sure.

251
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:49,099
Hey, you got any rolls?

252
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:15,098
Thanks a lot, man.

253
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:17,099
Look, forget it, okay?

254
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:21,099
Baton.

255
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:25,099
Okay.

256
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:28,099
I'll see you later.

257
00:24:33,099 --> 00:24:36,098
Bolton's reemergence in my life...

258
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:40,098
contradicted any memory I
had of him as a child.

259
00:24:40,099 --> 00:24:44,098
At Baton, he was sullen and small.

260
00:24:44,099 --> 00:24:45,098
Even I picked on him.

261
00:24:45,099 --> 00:24:47,099
Stay out of my way, Bolton.

262
00:24:51,099 --> 00:24:52,099
You hear me?

263
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:58,099
**

264
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:04,099
Something about my memory
of Bolton disturbed me.

265
00:25:05,099 --> 00:25:07,099
But I couldn't put my
finger on what it was.

266
00:25:10,099 --> 00:25:12,098
All night long I built an imaginary life...

267
00:25:12,099 --> 00:25:14,098
of which he was the center.

268
00:25:14,099 --> 00:25:17,098
And I always gave that life...

269
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:22,098
which was begun over and over
and transformed a dozen times...

270
00:25:22,099 --> 00:25:24,099
a violent end.

271
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:45,098
Hello.

272
00:25:45,099 --> 00:25:47,098
Hello. Dr. Graves?

273
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:51,099
This is Dr. Olsen. Nancy Olsen?

274
00:25:52,099 --> 00:25:56,098
I've been trying to reach
you for quite some time now.

275
00:25:56,099 --> 00:25:57,099
Are you...

276
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,098
Is everything all right?

277
00:26:01,099 --> 00:26:03,099
Yes, I'm fine.

278
00:26:04,099 --> 00:26:07,099
Good. I'm relieved to hear that.

279
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:10,099
I didn't know what happened.

280
00:26:12,099 --> 00:26:17,098
I thought maybe you had
decided against the internship,

281
00:26:17,099 --> 00:26:20,099
that perhaps I had interrupted you at
such a critical moment that...

282
00:26:22,099 --> 00:26:23,779
It's just that after your terrific success,

283
00:26:24,099 --> 00:26:26,099
I wanted to be the first to
congratulate you.

284
00:26:28,099 --> 00:26:30,098
Hello?

285
00:26:30,099 --> 00:26:32,098
Hello. Dr. Graves?

286
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:33,099
Hello!

287
00:26:34,099 --> 00:26:35,099
Hello?

288
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:39,099
Dr. Graves?

289
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,099
Dr. Graves, this is Dr. Olsen.

290
00:26:45,099 --> 00:26:47,099
Dr. Graves, I know you're in there.

291
00:26:52,601 --> 00:26:54,099
Dr. Graves.

292
00:26:55,099 --> 00:26:57,099
What happened to your face?

293
00:26:58,099 --> 00:27:01,099
Do I... look lascivious?

294
00:27:02,099 --> 00:27:06,098
Like the pitiful, decrepit result...

295
00:27:06,099 --> 00:27:09,098
of some hideous indulgence?

296
00:27:12,099 --> 00:27:14,098
Well,

297
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:18,098
take a good look, Miss Dr. Olsen.

298
00:27:18,099 --> 00:27:21,099
Because that's exactly...

299
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,099
what I am.

300
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:38,098
Dr. Graves... Please, call me Tom.

301
00:27:38,099 --> 00:27:40,098
Tom.

302
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:41,098
What happened?

303
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:46,098
I... accidentally ingested...

304
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:48,098
The serum? Yes.

305
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:51,099
God! All of it?

306
00:27:54,099 --> 00:27:55,099
What are you going to do?

307
00:27:56,099 --> 00:27:59,098
There's nothing l can do.

308
00:27:59,099 --> 00:28:03,098
You know as well as I the hormonal
system is self-perpetuating.

309
00:28:03,099 --> 00:28:05,851
The bio magnetic field is irreversible.

310
00:28:08,099 --> 00:28:10,098
I'm a monster.

311
00:28:10,099 --> 00:28:13,098
No, you're not.

312
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:15,099
Then look at me.

313
00:28:22,099 --> 00:28:23,099
Now...

314
00:28:24,099 --> 00:28:26,099
kiss me.

315
00:28:31,099 --> 00:28:34,099
Sorry. That was uncalled for.

316
00:28:38,099 --> 00:28:40,099
No.

317
00:28:43,099 --> 00:28:46,099
I have the greatest respect for you, Doctor.

318
00:28:49,099 --> 00:28:52,099
And of all the people this
could happen to...

319
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:57,099
why it had to be you, I just don't know.

320
00:29:04,099 --> 00:29:05,099
The fact is...

321
00:29:09,099 --> 00:29:12,099
it doesn't disgust me in the slightest.

322
00:29:16,099 --> 00:29:18,099
On the contrary.

323
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:22,099
It breaks my heart.

324
00:29:44,099 --> 00:29:45,099
Don't.

325
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:02,099
He was a meek soul.

326
00:30:03,099 --> 00:30:05,309
People pick on meek souls.

327
00:30:07,099 --> 00:30:08,379
It's something in human nature...

328
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:13,098
something very sad about human nature.

329
00:30:13,099 --> 00:30:17,098
We have to pick on those that
are weaker than us.

330
00:30:17,099 --> 00:30:20,098
And that's exactly what
started happening at Park Street.

331
00:30:20,099 --> 00:30:21,976
During the two and half years...

332
00:30:22,099 --> 00:30:24,098
that Richie attended Park
Street Elementary School,

333
00:30:24,099 --> 00:30:28,098
he allegedly made 47 visits
to the nurse's office.

334
00:30:28,099 --> 00:30:31,098
His mother was called as many as 25 times,

335
00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:35,098
and Richie met with the
principal at least 10.

336
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:38,098
Twelve classmates were
suspended, and three expelled.

337
00:30:38,099 --> 00:30:40,098
He was a little kid,

338
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:44,098
and I remember having to pull him out
of a few fights in the cafeteria...

339
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:46,098
and even in the playground.

340
00:30:46,099 --> 00:30:48,098
For a little kid, he was noticeable.

341
00:30:48,099 --> 00:30:50,098
Well, some people felt sorry for him,

342
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:53,098
but most of them wanted
to hit him and stuff.

343
00:30:53,099 --> 00:30:55,098
It was weird,

344
00:30:55,099 --> 00:30:59,098
'cause he's just a person that
you want to see get creamed.

345
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:02,098
Once I was right in the middle of
giving him an injection...

346
00:31:02,099 --> 00:31:04,098
and he called me "fatso."

347
00:31:04,099 --> 00:31:08,099
You know, I mean, I could
have hurt him or something. I...

348
00:31:10,099 --> 00:31:12,099
I just... I... I think he was evil.

349
00:31:14,099 --> 00:31:17,099
If it wasn't a bloody nose,
it was a sprained ankle.

350
00:31:18,099 --> 00:31:20,098
If it wasn't... I don't know...

351
00:31:20,099 --> 00:31:24,098
skinned knees, it was somebody put
something in his milk.

352
00:31:26,099 --> 00:31:31,098
Once, unfortunately, I discovered
him and a slightly older boy,

353
00:31:31,099 --> 00:31:34,098
Gregory Lazar, in the equipment room.

354
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:35,099
And,

355
00:31:36,099 --> 00:31:38,098
Gregory had the poor kid over his knee...

356
00:31:38,099 --> 00:31:42,098
and was apparently,
really giving it to him.

357
00:31:42,099 --> 00:31:46,098
Everything the principal said about
it was completely a lie.

358
00:31:46,099 --> 00:31:48,099
I didn't attack Richie Beacon at all.

359
00:31:49,099 --> 00:31:52,098
He just...

360
00:31:52,099 --> 00:31:56,099
kept bugging me, kept
bothering me every second.

361
00:31:57,099 --> 00:32:01,099
He... He... He made me.

362
00:32:05,099 --> 00:32:06,220
I got this when I was a kid.

363
00:32:12,099 --> 00:32:16,099
This guard was always just calling
me "pretty boy," right?

364
00:32:17,099 --> 00:32:19,099
"Pretty boy."

365
00:32:22,099 --> 00:32:23,099
Until I caught him.

366
00:32:30,099 --> 00:32:33,099
This is a tough one though. Look at this.

367
00:32:35,099 --> 00:32:37,099
I mean, that looks tough, right?

368
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:40,099
Yeah.

369
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:47,099
You're a kid, you get something like that,
you think you’re gonna die, you know?

370
00:32:51,099 --> 00:32:52,099
This one...

371
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:56,098
I was crashing in church.

372
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:59,098
You know, you should never
crash in churches.

373
00:32:59,099 --> 00:33:01,098
It's just bad luck.

374
00:33:01,099 --> 00:33:03,099
I told Nick.

375
00:33:08,099 --> 00:33:10,099
This one over here...

376
00:33:14,099 --> 00:33:16,099
You can't really see it.

377
00:33:17,099 --> 00:33:19,099
But it's...

378
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:22,099
it's right there.

379
00:33:26,099 --> 00:33:28,099
It's the pink, see?

380
00:33:35,099 --> 00:33:38,099
I got it in... in LaSalle.

381
00:33:41,099 --> 00:33:43,099
Nah, in Leden, I think.

382
00:33:46,099 --> 00:33:48,099
Anyway...

383
00:33:59,099 --> 00:34:03,098
There's nothing wrong with
being out in the world, Tom.

384
00:34:03,099 --> 00:34:05,099
I don't know why you’re so nervous about it.

385
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:11,098
People come down with all
sorts of conditions.

386
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:13,099
This is just one of them.

387
00:34:36,099 --> 00:34:37,099
Hello.

388
00:35:48,099 --> 00:35:49,099
Just ignore them.

389
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:56,098
* Reach up to me

390
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:58,098
**

391
00:35:58,099 --> 00:36:00,099
Don't!

392
00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:05,099
Why?

393
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:08,098
I can't.

394
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:10,099
Well, I can't do this.

395
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:13,098
Not now.

396
00:36:13,099 --> 00:36:14,099
But, Tom...

397
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:17,099
I'm in love with you.

398
00:36:19,099 --> 00:36:21,098
Look at me, Nancy.

399
00:36:21,099 --> 00:36:23,099
Think about what you're
saying and look at me!

400
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,098
Tom!

401
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:28,099
Tom! Tom!

402
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:35,099
Well, Richie was extremely gifted.

403
00:36:36,099 --> 00:36:38,099
Imaginative.

404
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:41,098
Always telling these elaborate stories.

405
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:43,099
He was a chronic liar...

406
00:36:45,099 --> 00:36:49,098
and, would often engage the
other classmates...

407
00:36:49,099 --> 00:36:51,099
in these stories of his.

408
00:36:52,099 --> 00:36:53,139
And they'd get very angry.

409
00:36:55,099 --> 00:36:59,098
He liked controlling people...

410
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:01,098
and watching them boil over.

411
00:37:01,099 --> 00:37:05,098
I was back one day in the garden...

412
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:07,098
I think it was a Sunday.

413
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:11,098
And all of a sudden I
saw something coming running...

414
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:13,098
from the Beacons' house over here.

415
00:37:13,099 --> 00:37:18,098
And I thought it was a deer
at first... a little deer.

416
00:37:18,099 --> 00:37:20,098
But then, as it came towards me,

417
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:23,098
I saw it was a little
boy, about five or six.

418
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:25,099
And he was naked.

419
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:29,098
And he came running closer,

420
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:32,098
and he was exhibiting
himself right in front of me.

421
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:36,099
As he got closer to me, he squatted down...

422
00:37:37,099 --> 00:37:39,098
and...

423
00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:43,099
and he made a B.M.right in front of me.

424
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:46,098
He turned Ar... He got up.
He turned around...

425
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:50,098
and he ran away just like a wild animal.

426
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:53,098
I didn't know what he'd do, so I just...

427
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:55,098
came into the house and closed my door.

428
00:37:55,099 --> 00:37:57,099
I just was so shocked.

429
00:38:16,099 --> 00:38:18,099
Pus-sy.

430
00:38:19,099 --> 00:38:21,099
Like a lookee!

431
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:24,099
Like a, like a lookee!

432
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:31,098
Like a, like a lookee!

433
00:38:31,099 --> 00:38:33,601
Like a, like a lookee!

434
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:37,098
Like a, like a lookee.

435
00:38:37,099 --> 00:38:39,098
Like a, like a lookee.

436
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:41,098
Like a, like a lookee.

437
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:42,099
Pus-sy.

438
00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:03,099
Every time I do a job...

439
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:06,099
I get stiff.

440
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:11,099
Every single time.

441
00:39:14,099 --> 00:39:18,098
'Cause you were doing them
with... What's his name?

442
00:39:18,099 --> 00:39:20,098
Nick.

443
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:23,098
That goof of yours.

444
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:25,098
What?

445
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:28,099
I do my jobs solo, man. You can't
do them with somebody else.

446
00:39:30,099 --> 00:39:31,099
That's not what I heard.

447
00:39:34,099 --> 00:39:36,098
Well, what you hear? Hey! Hey, Diego!

448
00:39:36,099 --> 00:39:37,098
Nothing. What?

449
00:39:37,099 --> 00:39:40,098
Bitch! Got a present for you.

450
00:39:40,099 --> 00:39:42,098
Nothing.

451
00:39:42,099 --> 00:39:43,098
What?

452
00:39:43,099 --> 00:39:47,099
Just that you and Nick were
partners or something.

453
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:52,098
Who said that? Don't remember.

454
00:39:52,099 --> 00:39:55,098
Who?

455
00:39:55,099 --> 00:39:56,099
Look, I don't remember.

456
00:40:08,099 --> 00:40:10,099
What do you think you’re looking at?

457
00:40:12,099 --> 00:40:14,099
You fucking queer.

458
00:40:15,099 --> 00:40:17,099
Fucking scum.

459
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:22,099
You think Nick gives a
shit what people think?

460
00:40:24,099 --> 00:40:26,098
You know what Nick would do?

461
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:30,098
Man, he's busted into a joint.

462
00:40:30,099 --> 00:40:32,099
He'd fucking piss all over it.

463
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:38,099
But first he'd do it up, you know. He'd...

464
00:40:39,099 --> 00:40:42,099
He'd drink or eat...

465
00:40:43,099 --> 00:40:45,099
and take a bath.

466
00:40:46,099 --> 00:40:48,099
Screw.

467
00:40:51,099 --> 00:40:54,098
I'm telling you, that guy...

468
00:40:54,099 --> 00:40:58,099
One time, we were in this bankers'
joint, right? In Orleans.

469
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:01,099
We? What?

470
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:08,098
Listen, don't you
fucking start with me, man.

471
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:10,098
I mean that. Hey.

472
00:41:10,099 --> 00:41:12,099
I mean that. Don't you start with me.
Bolton.

473
00:41:13,099 --> 00:41:16,098
So what? So we did shit together.
We got busted.

474
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:18,098
Big fucking deal!

475
00:41:18,099 --> 00:41:20,098
And who the fuck are you anyway?

476
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:24,099
You know, you walk around... You
try to act like a big shot.

477
00:41:25,099 --> 00:41:27,098
Who are you kidding?

478
00:41:27,099 --> 00:41:30,098
You are the biggest fucking
fruit in this joint.

479
00:41:30,099 --> 00:41:31,099
Hey!

480
00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:40,098
It was only a matter of time...

481
00:41:40,099 --> 00:41:43,098
before Bolton would be
accepted by the big shots.

482
00:41:43,099 --> 00:41:45,098
Go ahead.

483
00:41:45,099 --> 00:41:47,099
And nothing threatened our friendship more.

484
00:41:49,099 --> 00:41:52,098
I could tell Rass, the group's kingpin,

485
00:41:52,099 --> 00:41:55,099
had an eye for him from day one.

486
00:42:22,099 --> 00:42:24,098
I still could not take lightly...

487
00:42:24,099 --> 00:42:27,099
the idea that people made love without me.

488
00:43:12,099 --> 00:43:16,099
All over his forehead and
coming down like a...

489
00:43:17,099 --> 00:43:19,099
all pussy on his cheek like a...

490
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,183
Hey. Hey, lady.

491
00:43:24,099 --> 00:43:26,098
My goodness. And in such a hurry.

492
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:28,099
La-di-dah.

493
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:56,183
Yeah.

494
00:43:57,099 --> 00:43:58,099
Sugar.

495
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:06,099
Tom.

496
00:44:22,099 --> 00:44:23,099
Vodka, tonic.

497
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:26,099
Tom.

498
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:31,098
How'd you find me?

499
00:44:31,099 --> 00:44:33,099
Never mind.

500
00:44:39,099 --> 00:44:43,099
Tom, come home.

501
00:44:49,976 --> 00:44:52,098
We belong together.-
How can you say that?

502
00:44:52,099 --> 00:44:54,098
I know what I'm saying.

503
00:44:54,099 --> 00:44:57,099
I don't belong with anyone!

504
00:45:00,099 --> 00:45:02,099
You're wrong.

505
00:45:09,099 --> 00:45:13,098
The search is still on for the leper
murderer of Priscilla Monroe...

506
00:45:13,099 --> 00:45:17,098
and possibly four other
unidentified leper victims.

507
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:20,098
Already, the venomous cancer
has spread to hundreds...

508
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:22,098
of innocent men, women and children,

509
00:45:22,099 --> 00:45:26,098
and counts of sexual violence
are also on the rise.

510
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:28,098
Be on the lookout for a dark-haired man...

511
00:45:28,099 --> 00:45:32,098
with intense eyes and a
badly infected mouth.

512
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:34,099
You don't know anything about
that, do you, Tom?

513
00:45:36,099 --> 00:45:37,225
Tom?

514
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:40,099
Do you?

515
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:46,099
It's you, isn't it?

516
00:45:47,099 --> 00:45:49,098
Remain calm...

517
00:45:49,099 --> 00:45:51,340
You're the leper they've all
been talking about.-

518
00:45:54,099 --> 00:45:57,098
Why didn't you tell me you were contagious?

519
00:45:57,099 --> 00:45:59,098
When were you going to tell me this?

520
00:45:59,099 --> 00:46:02,098
I was...

521
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:05,098
I was scared that I would frighten you away.

522
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:08,098
You're all l have left, Nancy.

523
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:12,098
What makes you so certain that
I'm safe with you?

524
00:46:12,099 --> 00:46:14,098
Nancy.

525
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:15,099
I love you.

526
00:46:34,099 --> 00:46:35,099
Tom.

527
00:46:41,099 --> 00:46:43,099
I have to think.

528
00:46:46,099 --> 00:46:49,099
Tom, I need some time alone to think.

529
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:52,098
Nancy... I'm sorry.

530
00:46:52,099 --> 00:46:54,099
I'll call you.

531
00:46:55,099 --> 00:46:57,099
Please.

532
00:46:58,099 --> 00:46:59,098
Nancy.

533
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:01,099
Nancy.

534
00:51:26,099 --> 00:51:29,098
In mid-November of 1984,

535
00:51:29,099 --> 00:51:32,098
Richie Beacon was treated at
Cloyfield Medical Center...

536
00:51:32,099 --> 00:51:35,098
for injuries to the thighs and lower back.

537
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:38,098
His parents claimed he’d been
hurt by the other kids at school,

538
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:40,099
but, well, frankly, I doubted it.

539
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:42,098
Why?

540
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:46,098
I felt they were
being purposefully vague with me.

541
00:51:46,099 --> 00:51:50,098
There were other strange
circumstances surrounding the case.

542
00:51:52,099 --> 00:51:54,098
I found an infectious discharge.

543
00:51:54,099 --> 00:51:57,098
It was genitally secreted.

544
00:51:57,099 --> 00:51:59,098
Sharp yellow color.

545
00:51:59,099 --> 00:52:01,099
What did you guys used to do?

546
00:52:02,099 --> 00:52:05,098
Just stupid junk.

547
00:52:05,099 --> 00:52:06,099
Like what?

548
00:52:07,099 --> 00:52:11,098
He'd go, like,"You're the
dad, and you're really mad,

549
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:13,099
and I'm, you know, the son.

550
00:52:14,099 --> 00:52:16,099
"I just did this thing or something."

551
00:52:18,099 --> 00:52:21,098
It was just some stupid game.

552
00:52:21,099 --> 00:52:23,098
What kind of game? He just
totally forced me to do it.

553
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:28,099
I mean, it's like he got into
trouble or something.

554
00:52:29,099 --> 00:52:30,726
Well... Well...

555
00:52:31,099 --> 00:52:34,098
If I didn't do it, he'd just,
like, sit there and laugh,

556
00:52:34,099 --> 00:52:37,098
and I'd get so mad I'd just
finally do what he said...

557
00:52:37,099 --> 00:52:42,099
totally spank him... just
to make him shut up.

558
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:47,098
It's very odd,

559
00:52:47,099 --> 00:52:49,098
but...

560
00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:54,098
Mrs. Beacon's account of
Richie's disappearance...

561
00:52:54,099 --> 00:52:57,099
you know, him killing his
father and flying away...

562
00:52:59,099 --> 00:53:02,099
came directly from one of his stories.

563
00:53:41,099 --> 00:53:42,099
Nancy?

564
00:53:42,934 --> 00:53:46,098
Stop it! Piece of trash! Hear me, you slut?

565
00:53:46,099 --> 00:53:48,099
Let go of me!

566
00:53:49,099 --> 00:53:51,098
Slut! Slut!

567
00:53:51,099 --> 00:53:54,099
You're hurting me! You are a pig!

568
00:53:56,099 --> 00:53:58,098
What did you just call me?

569
00:53:58,099 --> 00:54:00,099
Nancy? What did you just
call me, you little tramp?

570
00:54:02,099 --> 00:54:04,098
Just go, you rotten filth.

571
00:54:04,099 --> 00:54:06,098
Good for nothing!

572
00:54:06,099 --> 00:54:07,299
What did you just call me?

573
00:55:27,099 --> 00:55:29,099
Nancy.

574
00:55:47,099 --> 00:55:49,099
Nancy!

575
00:55:50,099 --> 00:55:52,099
Nancy!

576
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:55,099
Nancy!

577
00:56:10,099 --> 00:56:12,099
Nancy.

578
00:56:21,099 --> 00:56:24,099
God. No.

579
00:56:36,099 --> 00:56:38,099
Tom.

580
00:56:42,099 --> 00:56:45,099
Atmospheric toxins...

581
00:56:46,099 --> 00:56:49,099
changed the magnetic field.

582
00:56:51,099 --> 00:56:53,099
That's what caused it to spread.

583
00:56:57,099 --> 00:56:59,099
Don't blame yourself.

584
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:17,099
Nancy.

585
00:57:43,099 --> 00:57:44,099
I love you, Nancy.

586
00:57:59,099 --> 00:58:01,099
Now it begins.

587
00:58:09,099 --> 00:58:11,098
Hello, ma'am.

588
00:58:11,099 --> 00:58:13,098
Miss Olsen?

589
00:58:13,099 --> 00:58:15,099
Better open it up in here.

590
00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:19,099
Open up! Come on! Come on. Open up.

591
00:58:44,099 --> 00:58:45,099
So...

592
00:58:50,099 --> 00:58:51,099
Hey.

593
00:58:55,099 --> 00:58:56,142
Shit. I gotta go.

594
00:58:58,099 --> 00:58:59,099
Go ahead.

595
00:59:07,099 --> 00:59:09,099
You want a drag, pal?

596
00:59:24,099 --> 00:59:27,098
You're a slut, you know that?
Anyone ever tell you that?

597
00:59:27,099 --> 00:59:30,098
And your little man, he can
ride my fucking prick.

598
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:31,159
What the fuck are you talking about?

599
00:59:31,183 --> 00:59:34,099
Hey, smile. Take your cap off.

600
00:59:34,309 --> 00:59:37,098
Look, John, get lost, would you?

601
00:59:37,099 --> 00:59:39,098
Got my hands in my pockets.

602
00:59:39,099 --> 00:59:42,098
If they see us together, they're
gonna start bullshitting about me.

603
00:59:42,099 --> 00:59:44,099
Why? I don't know. Just get lost.

604
00:59:45,099 --> 00:59:46,099
Why?

605
00:59:48,099 --> 00:59:49,099
They think you’re a...

606
00:59:52,099 --> 00:59:55,099
Look, I tried to tell 'em that you're okay.

607
00:59:58,099 --> 00:59:59,099
Come on. Let go, man!

608
01:00:10,099 --> 01:00:12,099
You're my man.

609
01:00:19,099 --> 01:00:21,098
Bolton's friendship with
Rass and the others...

610
01:00:21,099 --> 01:00:25,098
filled me with jealousy but
instigated a transformation.

611
01:00:25,099 --> 01:00:30,098
I felt myself growing mean, icy, stiff,

612
01:00:30,099 --> 01:00:32,099
gleaming like a sword blade.

613
01:00:37,099 --> 01:00:39,267
Hey, you! Stop there! Come on.
Let's go around.

614
01:00:48,099 --> 01:00:50,099
Halt! I said halt!

615
01:00:53,099 --> 01:00:57,099
We'll get you!- Get outta here!

616
01:00:58,099 --> 01:01:00,099
Get outta here!

617
01:01:11,099 --> 01:01:14,098
Well, I don't know what
kind of shouting they heard,

618
01:01:14,099 --> 01:01:17,098
but, yes, we were fighting.

619
01:01:17,099 --> 01:01:21,099
Fred was under a lot of
stress, and I was busy.

620
01:01:22,099 --> 01:01:23,099
Richie kept getting hurt.

621
01:01:23,684 --> 01:01:27,098
It was a bad period of time in general.

622
01:01:27,099 --> 01:01:31,098
Did your arguments have
mostly to do with Richie?

623
01:01:31,099 --> 01:01:32,099
No. Not at all.

624
01:01:33,099 --> 01:01:35,099
Fred was angry at me.

625
01:01:37,099 --> 01:01:39,098
He thought that I wasn't
spending enough time with Richie,

626
01:01:39,099 --> 01:01:44,098
and he had to know where I was every second.

627
01:01:44,099 --> 01:01:47,099
A neighbor claimed she saw him ripping
up your flower beds one night.

628
01:01:49,099 --> 01:01:51,099
He was just angry.

629
01:01:53,099 --> 01:01:57,098
He'd fired our gardener,
this Spanish kid, Jose,

630
01:01:57,099 --> 01:02:01,098
and... he was just very angry at me,

631
01:02:01,099 --> 01:02:05,099
so he tore up my flowers.

632
01:02:10,099 --> 01:02:12,099
I know that I was wrong.

633
01:02:14,099 --> 01:02:17,099
But my child was watching over me.

634
01:02:20,099 --> 01:02:22,099
My child was an angel of judgment,

635
01:02:24,099 --> 01:02:26,099
and I sinned against the Lord.

636
01:04:00,099 --> 01:04:02,098
We are at 69 Gold Street,

637
01:04:02,099 --> 01:04:06,098
the residence of Dr. Thomas Graves,
the notorious leper murderer...

638
01:04:06,099 --> 01:04:10,098
who has been the cause of countless
deaths in the Centerville area alone.

639
01:04:10,099 --> 01:04:12,099
Local authorities have the
premises surrounded...

640
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:16,098
and police are presently escorting all
other tenants out of the building...

641
01:04:16,099 --> 01:04:18,098
which is considered highly contaminated.

642
01:04:18,099 --> 01:04:21,098
To think I've been living next
door to him for three years,

643
01:04:21,099 --> 01:04:23,098
not so much as suspecting what he did.

644
01:04:23,099 --> 01:04:25,098
I knew something was odd about him.

645
01:04:25,099 --> 01:04:28,098
I'll never forget the first
time I laid eyes on him.

646
01:04:28,099 --> 01:04:30,098
Get your Dr. Graves mask right here.

647
01:04:30,099 --> 01:04:33,099
Authentic mask of the leper murderer.

648
01:04:43,684 --> 01:04:49,098
I have no doubt that we’ll be able to
seize this menace to the community...

649
01:04:49,099 --> 01:04:53,099
and stop the spread of
this despicable contagion.

650
01:04:58,099 --> 01:05:01,098
About a week before the 3rd,

651
01:05:01,099 --> 01:05:04,098
Richie had sprained his wrist at school.

652
01:05:04,099 --> 01:05:10,098
He twisted it, and this teacher
that lives near here drove him home.

653
01:05:10,099 --> 01:05:13,098
It was about 1:15 or something.

654
01:05:13,099 --> 01:05:17,099
I had no idea that he would
be coming home when he did.

655
01:05:19,099 --> 01:05:24,099
So he walked in on me with this kid...

656
01:05:25,099 --> 01:05:28,099
Jose, the gardener.

657
01:06:01,099 --> 01:06:03,099
Hey, Broom, what's up?

658
01:06:11,099 --> 01:06:13,099
What's wrong with you?

659
01:06:34,099 --> 01:06:36,098
All right, Dr. Thomas Graves,

660
01:06:36,099 --> 01:06:39,098
this is Deputy Hansen of Centerville County.

661
01:06:39,099 --> 01:06:41,098
I'm required by law to tell you...

662
01:06:41,099 --> 01:06:44,099
that you are under arrest. Get your Dr.
Graves masks here!

663
01:06:44,142 --> 01:06:49,098
This time we have you
completely surrounded,

664
01:06:49,099 --> 01:06:51,099
and there is no chance of escape.

665
01:06:58,099 --> 01:07:01,098
The apartment is surrounded,

666
01:07:01,099 --> 01:07:06,099
and you are ordered to
make yourself visible.

667
01:07:11,099 --> 01:07:15,099
Dr. Thomas Graves, you are under arrest.

668
01:07:16,099 --> 01:07:17,098
Come to the window.

669
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:20,099
The apartment is surrounded.

670
01:07:21,099 --> 01:07:23,099
Why? Make yourself visible.

671
01:07:26,099 --> 01:07:27,098
Why?

672
01:07:27,099 --> 01:07:32,099
Dr. Thomas Graves, come to
the window and show yourself.

673
01:07:45,099 --> 01:07:50,098
All I could remember thinking was, "God.
It's Richie."

674
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:56,098
But when I saw his face, it reminded
me of this time years before...

675
01:07:56,099 --> 01:08:00,098
when Fred was spanking Richie...

676
01:08:00,099 --> 01:08:02,099
and I was watching.

677
01:08:03,099 --> 01:08:05,098
And I swear...

678
01:08:05,099 --> 01:08:08,099
he looked at me with the
exact same expression.

679
01:08:12,099 --> 01:08:16,098
It was like some... oath...

680
01:08:16,099 --> 01:08:20,099
in some other language.

681
01:08:22,099 --> 01:08:24,099
His face was so weird.

682
01:08:25,099 --> 01:08:27,099
It made me feel ashamed.

683
01:09:25,099 --> 01:09:27,099
My God.

684
01:11:39,099 --> 01:11:42,099
Still, I did you.

685
01:11:43,099 --> 01:11:44,099
You just don’t think.

686
01:11:45,099 --> 01:11:49,099
It's the same. I shot.

687
01:11:50,099 --> 01:11:52,099
And I'll do it whenever I want.

688
01:12:13,099 --> 01:12:14,099
God!

689
01:12:28,099 --> 01:12:29,098
Don't worry.

690
01:12:29,099 --> 01:12:31,099
Come on.- Let's get that open.

691
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:35,099
Don't worry.

692
01:12:37,099 --> 01:12:39,099
Open your mug.

693
01:12:40,059 --> 01:12:41,099
Open your mug!

694
01:12:42,099 --> 01:12:44,099
Shorty, play Jacobs. Yeah.

695
01:12:49,099 --> 01:12:51,098
You're dead. We're gonna fuck you up.

696
01:12:51,099 --> 01:12:52,099
Open it up, cocksucker.

697
01:12:54,099 --> 01:12:56,099
I said open your fuckin'
mug. Open your fuckin' mug.

698
01:13:00,099 --> 01:13:02,098
Yeah.

699
01:13:02,099 --> 01:13:03,642
Cocksucker.- All the way.

700
01:13:04,099 --> 01:13:05,099
Open it up.

701
01:13:10,099 --> 01:13:12,099
Lookee, lookee.

702
01:13:21,099 --> 01:13:23,099
Chanchi. Chanchi.

703
01:13:27,099 --> 01:13:29,099
You keep that mouth open, bitch.

704
01:13:38,099 --> 01:13:39,098
All right, Shorty.

705
01:13:39,099 --> 01:13:41,098
Yeah!

706
01:13:41,099 --> 01:13:43,098
Go get him. Go on.

707
01:13:43,099 --> 01:13:45,098
Open. Wider.

708
01:13:45,099 --> 01:13:47,099
Keep your fuckin' mug open.

709
01:13:51,099 --> 01:13:53,099
Yeah!

710
01:15:16,099 --> 01:15:21,098
Science tells us there is
always a reason why...

711
01:15:21,099 --> 01:15:25,098
a star forms or a body is ill.

712
01:15:25,099 --> 01:15:28,099
And religion does the same.

713
01:15:31,099 --> 01:15:37,099
This is the story of one
man's quest into darkness.

714
01:15:38,099 --> 01:15:41,099
True or false?

715
01:15:44,099 --> 01:15:46,099
Both.

716
01:15:59,099 --> 01:16:01,098
There he is.

717
01:16:01,099 --> 01:16:03,099
I'll tell you something.

718
01:16:09,099 --> 01:16:10,099
My God!

719
01:16:12,099 --> 01:16:13,099
Don't jump!

720
01:16:14,099 --> 01:16:16,098
We'll talk. Wait.

721
01:16:16,099 --> 01:16:17,099
Let's talk.

722
01:16:23,099 --> 01:16:25,099
You think I'm scum.

723
01:16:27,099 --> 01:16:30,098
You think I'm dirt, don't you?

724
01:16:30,099 --> 01:16:31,099
Don't you?

725
01:16:36,099 --> 01:16:37,099
Well...

726
01:16:39,099 --> 01:16:41,099
I'll tell you something.

727
01:16:49,099 --> 01:16:52,099
Every one of you down
there is exactly the same.

728
01:16:54,099 --> 01:16:56,099
Only you’ll never know it.

729
01:16:58,099 --> 01:17:01,099
You'll... You'll never know it...

730
01:17:03,099 --> 01:17:08,099
'cause you'll never know what pride is!

731
01:17:09,099 --> 01:17:13,099
'Cause pride is the only thing...

732
01:17:14,099 --> 01:17:16,098
that lets you stand up to misery.

733
01:17:16,099 --> 01:17:19,099
And not this kind of misery...

734
01:17:21,099 --> 01:17:26,099
but the kind of misery the whole
stinking world is made of!

735
01:17:54,099 --> 01:17:55,309
Nothing, Doctor.

736
01:17:56,099 --> 01:17:58,099
He's gone. He's gone.

737
01:18:00,099 --> 01:18:02,099
Doctor?

738
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:11,099
I can hear the angels...

739
01:18:13,018 --> 01:18:15,099
farting on the ceiling.

740
01:18:32,099 --> 01:18:34,098
We'll head him off at the north wall!

741
01:18:34,099 --> 01:18:37,098
Load up and go stand at the north wall!

742
01:18:37,099 --> 01:18:39,099
It's the North Tower.

743
01:18:43,099 --> 01:18:45,098
Bolton! He just told us to shoot!

744
01:18:45,099 --> 01:18:47,098
Fire on escapee. Fire!

745
01:18:47,099 --> 01:18:49,099
Bolton!

746
01:18:50,099 --> 01:18:52,098
Three days later,

747
01:18:52,099 --> 01:18:56,099
Rass took Bolton with him on an
attempted escape from Fontenal.

748
01:18:57,099 --> 01:19:00,098
Rass made it as far as Orleans.

749
01:19:00,099 --> 01:19:02,099
Bolton was shot by a prison guard.

750
01:19:06,099 --> 01:19:10,098
After Fred heard about everything...
Leave me alone! Will you stop?

751
01:19:10,099 --> 01:19:13,098
He bought this gun. I told you!

752
01:19:13,099 --> 01:19:14,098
I told you!

753
01:19:14,099 --> 01:19:19,098
And he came home one day and he just
started going totally crazy with it.

754
01:19:19,099 --> 01:19:22,098
You tell me who else knows.
Richie. Richie, go away.

755
01:19:22,099 --> 01:19:25,098
Just go in your room. No! Leave it.

756
01:19:25,099 --> 01:19:27,098
Go on. Get outta here. Just go...

757
01:19:27,099 --> 01:19:28,098
Don't hit him. You shut the fuck up!

758
01:19:28,099 --> 01:19:33,099
You know, he's swinging it all over the
place and he's showing it to Richie.

759
01:19:34,099 --> 01:19:36,099
So when he fell asleep on the couch later,

760
01:19:36,350 --> 01:19:39,099
I put the gun away in the drawer.

761
01:19:40,099 --> 01:19:42,098
But sometime in the middle of the night,

762
01:19:42,099 --> 01:19:45,098
he got up and he just started in again.

763
01:19:45,099 --> 01:19:49,098
He was smacking me around
and screaming his head off,

764
01:19:49,099 --> 01:19:52,098
and, of course, it woke up Richie.

765
01:19:52,099 --> 01:19:54,099
I wanna know! But Fred
was like some crazy man.

766
01:19:55,099 --> 01:19:57,099
He just kept coming at me and coming at me,

767
01:19:58,099 --> 01:20:02,098
and he just throws the lamp at me,

768
01:20:02,099 --> 01:20:03,100
which knocked me down.

769
01:20:07,099 --> 01:20:10,098
How many times did you fuck him in my bed?

770
01:20:10,099 --> 01:20:13,098
Fuck him in my bed?
Listen! Listen!

771
01:20:13,099 --> 01:20:16,098
Bring some fucking spic in my bed?

772
01:20:16,099 --> 01:20:18,099
Tell me! Tell me.

773
01:20:22,099 --> 01:20:23,934
How many people know?
What do you want from me?

774
01:20:24,099 --> 01:20:25,098
I just wanna know the goddamn truth!

775
01:20:25,099 --> 01:20:30,098
I just remember him coming
at me around the throat...

776
01:20:30,099 --> 01:20:35,098
and me trying to hold his arms
down, but he was like steel,

777
01:20:35,099 --> 01:20:38,099
and I just thought, "This is it."

778
01:20:39,099 --> 01:20:42,099
And then, all of a sudden,

779
01:20:43,099 --> 01:20:45,099
I hear this explosion.

780
01:20:46,099 --> 01:20:48,098
It was like a bomb.

781
01:20:48,099 --> 01:20:52,098
And then another.

782
01:20:52,099 --> 01:20:55,099
And then Fred just collapses on top of me.

783
01:20:59,099 --> 01:21:02,099
I look up, and Richie's
standing there with the gun.

784
01:21:05,099 --> 01:21:07,098
I think he looked at me...

785
01:21:07,099 --> 01:21:11,098
and then sort of took
off toward the window.

786
01:21:11,099 --> 01:21:13,099
I was pulling Fred off of me...

787
01:21:14,099 --> 01:21:16,099
when I saw him standing on the ledge.

788
01:21:18,099 --> 01:21:21,559
And I screamed. I thought
he was gonna jump.

789
01:21:23,099 --> 01:21:25,099
And then, all of a sudden, he did.

790
01:21:27,099 --> 01:21:31,098
He just jumped off the ledge and went up...

791
01:21:31,099 --> 01:21:34,098
like a wind or something had come and
taken him 'cause he was so light,

792
01:21:34,099 --> 01:21:37,098
but it wasn't the wind.

793
01:21:37,099 --> 01:21:38,099
He just took off.

794
01:21:39,099 --> 01:21:41,098
It was so weird.

795
01:21:41,099 --> 01:21:45,099
When I ran and watched him go up,

796
01:21:45,183 --> 01:21:48,099
he just flew up.

797
01:21:50,099 --> 01:21:53,098
And I called to him,

798
01:21:53,099 --> 01:21:57,099
and he sort of tilted my way...

799
01:21:59,099 --> 01:22:03,099
before he kind of rolled out of sight.

800
01:22:05,099 --> 01:22:07,099
My little boy.
