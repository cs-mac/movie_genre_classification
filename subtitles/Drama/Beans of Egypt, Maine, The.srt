You run like mules.

71
00:08:05,267 --> 00:08:10,387
- Hey, Rameses, how'd you like your face carved on a wall?
- Someday, yes.

72
00:08:10,422 --> 00:08:13,147
How about now?

73
00:08:16,565 --> 00:08:17,832
You almost killed me!

74
00:08:17,867 --> 00:08:20,227
Oh, come on.
Where's your sense of fun?

75
00:08:20,262 --> 00:08:23,012
Oh, it's fun you want?

76
00:08:24,102 --> 00:08:27,067
Whoa!

77
00:08:29,747 --> 00:08:32,667
Whoa! Aah!

78
00:08:36,107 --> 00:08:38,027
Ohh. Moses?

79
00:08:38,062 --> 00:08:41,187
Whoa!

80
00:08:44,347 --> 00:08:47,947
Whoo!

81
00:08:50,827 --> 00:08:52,747
Whoo!

82
00:08:55,907 --> 00:08:58,752
Come on, you.
Whoa!

83
00:08:58,787 --> 00:09:01,787
Come on, Moses. Admit it.
You've always looked up to me.

84
00:09:01,822 --> 00:09:04,427
Yes, but it's
not much of a view.

85
00:09:05,391 --> 00:09:08,104
Hyah! Whoo!

86
00:09:10,219 --> 00:09:11,071
Hey!

87
00:09:11,707 --> 00:09:15,147
- Second born, second place.
- Not for long.

88
00:09:25,707 --> 00:09:27,227
Whoa!

89
00:09:31,587 --> 00:09:35,427
- Whoa!
- Aah! Aaah!

90
00:09:52,704 --> 00:09:54,235
Jump!

91
00:10:31,267 --> 00:10:34,227
Whoo!

92
00:10:36,572 --> 00:10:38,907
You don't think we'll
get in trouble for this, do you?

93
00:10:38,942 --> 00:10:40,787
No, not a chance.

94
00:10:41,753 --> 00:10:43,947
Why do the gods torment me...

95
00:10:43,982 --> 00:10:46,872
with such reckless,
destructive,

96
00:10:46,907 --> 00:10:49,467
- blasphemous sons?
- Father, hear what I...

97
00:10:49,502 --> 00:10:52,067
Be still!
Pharaoh speaks.

98
00:10:53,347 --> 00:10:55,912
I seek to build an empire,

99
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:58,747
and your only thought
is to amuse yourselves...

100
00:10:58,782 --> 00:11:00,592
by tearing it down.

101
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:02,512
Have I taught you nothing?

102
00:11:02,547 --> 00:11:06,547
You mustn't be so hard on yourself, Your
Majesty. You're an excellent teacher.

103
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:09,547
It's not your fault
your sons learned nothing.

104
00:11:09,582 --> 00:11:11,467
- They learned blasphemy.
- True.

105
00:11:11,502 --> 00:11:14,512
Father, the fault is mine.

106
00:11:14,547 --> 00:11:17,547
I goaded Rameses on,
and so I am responsible.

107
00:11:17,582 --> 00:11:20,032
Hmm.
Responsible.

108
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:23,067
And do you know the meaning
of that word, Rameses?

109
00:11:23,102 --> 00:11:24,912
I understand, Father.

110
00:11:24,947 --> 00:11:28,987
And do you understand the task for which
your birth has destined you?

111
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,312
The ancient traditions.

112
00:11:31,347 --> 00:11:33,552
When I pass
into the next world,

113
00:11:33,587 --> 00:11:36,592
then you will be
the morning and evening star.

114
00:11:36,627 --> 00:11:39,307
One damaged temple does not
destroy centuries of tradition.

115
00:11:39,342 --> 00:11:42,427
But one weak link
can break the chain...

116
00:11:42,462 --> 00:11:46,307
of a mighty dynasty!

117
00:11:53,987 --> 00:11:56,467
You have my leave to go.

118
00:11:56,502 --> 00:11:58,387
Father.

119
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:13,032
Father?

120
00:12:14,311 --> 00:12:16,267
You know it was
really my fault.

121
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:19,392
Must you be so hard on him?

122
00:12:19,427 --> 00:12:23,187
Moses, you will never
have to carry a burden...

123
00:12:23,222 --> 00:12:26,192
like the crown
I will pass to Rameses.

124
00:12:26,227 --> 00:12:31,147
He must not allow himself
to be led astray,

125
00:12:31,182 --> 00:12:33,947
not even by you, my son.

126
00:12:35,467 --> 00:12:38,807
All he cares about is...
is your approval.

127
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:42,147
I know he will live up
to your expectations.

128
00:12:42,182 --> 00:12:44,627
He only needs the opportunity.

129
00:12:44,662 --> 00:12:47,427
Maybe. Maybe so.

130
00:12:48,947 --> 00:12:52,147
Go now. I shall
see you both tonight.

131
00:13:05,787 --> 00:13:08,627
- Well, that went well.
- Just go away.

132
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,472
Could have been worse.

133
00:13:10,507 --> 00:13:14,067
"The weak link in the chain."
That's what he called me.

134
00:13:16,027 --> 00:13:18,952
Well, you are rather pathetic.

135
00:13:18,987 --> 00:13:21,912
Irresponsible,
ignorant of the traditions.

136
00:13:21,947 --> 00:13:24,867
He practically accused me
of bringing down the dynasty.

137
00:13:24,902 --> 00:13:27,507
Yeah, I can see it now.
There go the pyramids!

138
00:13:29,112 --> 00:13:30,752
You can laugh about it.

139
00:13:30,787 --> 00:13:34,352
Statues cracking and toppling over.
The Nile drying up.

140
00:13:34,387 --> 00:13:39,227
Single-handedly, you will manage to bring
the greatest kingdom on Earth to ruin.

141
00:13:39,262 --> 00:13:40,480
Tell me this, Moses.
Tell me this.

142
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,191
Why is it that every time
you start something,

143
00:13:43,215 --> 00:13:46,107
I'm the one
who ends up in trouble?

144
00:13:46,142 --> 00:13:48,872
Ah, man! Oh.

145
00:13:48,907 --> 00:13:52,807
- Ah, it's Rameses. You're in trouble, young man.
- Get down here!

146
00:13:52,842 --> 00:13:56,707
- I think you owe us an apology.
- Oh, my new thing!

147
00:13:56,742 --> 00:13:59,432
- I am so upset!
- You might as well.

148
00:13:59,467 --> 00:14:01,987
- You'll pay for this.
- We're gonna tell the Pharaoh!

149
00:14:05,067 --> 00:14:09,067
- Oh, look at me. I'm drenched again.
- Hey. I figured it out.

150
00:14:09,102 --> 00:14:11,592
- You know what your problem is, Rameses?
- What?

151
00:14:11,627 --> 00:14:15,507
- You care too much.
- And your problem is, you don't care at all.

152
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:18,347
Oh, in that case, I suppose
you care a lot more than I do...

153
00:14:18,382 --> 00:14:22,067
that we're late for the banquet,
for example.

154
00:14:24,506 --> 00:14:25,232
I'm done for.

155
00:14:25,267 --> 00:14:28,107
- Father will kill me.
- Don't worry.

156
00:14:28,142 --> 00:14:30,947
Nobody will even
notice us coming in.

157
00:14:35,427 --> 00:14:38,787
"Nobody will
even notice."

158
00:14:41,016 --> 00:14:43,672
Ah, the young princes.

159
00:14:43,707 --> 00:14:46,632
Rameses, you were just
named prince regent.

160
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:50,907
You are now responsible
for overseeing all the temples.

161
00:14:50,942 --> 00:14:53,627
I suggest you get over there...

162
00:14:53,662 --> 00:14:56,264
and thank your father.

163
00:14:57,009 --> 00:14:58,583
Apparently, Moses,

164
00:14:58,618 --> 00:15:00,832
someone thought he...

165
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:03,827
just needed the opportunity.

166
00:15:06,556 --> 00:15:07,728
My lord Pharaoh.

167
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,187
I propose that the high priests
offer tribute...

168
00:15:10,222 --> 00:15:12,032
to their new regent.

169
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:14,667
An excellent idea.
Hotep! Huy!

170
00:15:15,186 --> 00:15:16,432
- Huy.
- Hmm?

171
00:15:16,764 --> 00:15:19,022
- The Midian girl.
- That's a good idea!

172
00:15:19,182 --> 00:15:21,067
Go get her.

173
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,752
By the power of Ra,

174
00:15:23,787 --> 00:15:27,427
we present for your
delectation and delight...

175
00:15:27,462 --> 00:15:31,067
an exotic apparition
stolen from a faraway land.

176
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:43,005
We offer you this
delicate desert flower.

177
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:51,707
Let us inspect
this... desert flower.

178
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,672
More like a desert cobra.

179
00:15:55,707 --> 00:15:58,467
Not much of a snake
charmer, are you?

180
00:15:58,502 --> 00:16:00,712
That's why I give her to you.

181
00:16:00,747 --> 00:16:04,347
- No, that's generous, but...
- I won't be given to anyone.

182
00:16:04,382 --> 00:16:07,464
Especially an arrogant,
pampered palace brat!

183
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:10,472
Are you going to
let her talk to you like that?

184
00:16:10,507 --> 00:16:13,587
You will show the proper respect
for a prince of Egypt.

185
00:16:13,622 --> 00:16:16,997
But I am showing you
all the respect you deserve:

186
00:16:17,113 --> 00:16:18,316
none!

187
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,672
No. Wait!

188
00:16:20,707 --> 00:16:22,363
- Be still.
- Untie this rope!

189
00:16:22,464 --> 00:16:24,907
- I demand you set me free!
- Be still.

190
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:27,947
- Let go!
- As you wish.

191
00:16:40,713 --> 00:16:41,672
You there!

192
00:16:41,707 --> 00:16:43,632
Have her dried off...

193
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:47,072
and sent to
Prince Moses' chambers.

194
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:50,867
If it pleases you,
Father, my first act as regent...

195
00:16:50,902 --> 00:16:53,173
is to appoint Moses...

196
00:16:53,322 --> 00:16:57,387
as royal chief architect.

197
00:17:24,531 --> 00:17:25,929
Well...

198
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:28,187
Right.

199
00:17:42,867 --> 00:17:45,747
Shh. Come on.

200
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,465
Guards.

201
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,270
Prince Moses.

202
00:18:01,986 --> 00:18:04,066
Uh...

203
00:18:04,587 --> 00:18:07,187
there's a... a man
tied up in my room.

204
00:18:08,427 --> 00:18:11,147
- Well, look into it.
- Right away, sire.

205
00:18:24,987 --> 00:18:26,869
Please, I need water.

206
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,746
- I have a long journey ahead of me.
- May God protect you.

207
00:18:30,782 --> 00:18:33,147
Thank you.

208
00:18:34,787 --> 00:18:36,707
Hut-hut.

209
00:18:48,496 --> 00:18:51,987
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I...

210
00:18:52,022 --> 00:18:54,312
Oh, please forgive me. I...

211
00:18:54,347 --> 00:18:57,787
I didn't expect
to see... you...

212
00:18:57,822 --> 00:18:59,459
here, of all places,

213
00:18:59,521 --> 00:19:01,952
at-at-at our door.

214
00:19:01,987 --> 00:19:05,211
- Mmm, at last!
- At last?

215
00:19:05,257 --> 00:19:08,906
Didn't I tell you, Aaron? Didn't I tell you? I
knew he would return to us when he was ready.

216
00:19:08,945 --> 00:19:10,104
Miriam, do you want us flogged?

217
00:19:10,139 --> 00:19:11,952
I knew you cared
about our freedom.

218
00:19:11,987 --> 00:19:14,387
- Miriam!
- Freedom? Why would I care about that?

219
00:19:14,422 --> 00:19:18,227
Because you're...
well, you're our brother.

220
00:19:18,262 --> 00:19:20,067
- What?
- Be...

221
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:26,627
- They never told you?
- Who never told me what?

222
00:19:28,665 --> 00:19:30,952
But you're here.
You must know.

223
00:19:30,987 --> 00:19:33,720
- Be careful, slave!
- Oh, my good prince.

224
00:19:33,782 --> 00:19:36,867
Um, she's... she's exhausted
from the day's work.

225
00:19:36,902 --> 00:19:38,298
Uh, not that it was too much.

226
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:39,985
We... We quite
enjoyed it.

227
00:19:40,016 --> 00:19:43,427
But... But she's confused
and knows not to whom she speaks.

228
00:19:43,462 --> 00:19:47,187
I know to whom I speak, Aaron.
I know who you are.

229
00:19:47,493 --> 00:19:49,512
- And you are not a prince of Egypt.
- Miriam.

230
00:19:49,547 --> 00:19:52,207
- What did you say?
- Your Highness, pay her no heed.

231
00:19:52,242 --> 00:19:54,694
C... Come, Miriam.
May I discuss something with you?

232
00:19:54,729 --> 00:19:57,112
No, Aaron. No!
Please, Moses, you must believe!

233
00:19:57,147 --> 00:19:59,627
- That's enough.
- You were born of my mother, Yocheved.

234
00:19:59,662 --> 00:20:01,712
- Stop it.
- You are our brother!

235
00:20:01,747 --> 00:20:04,627
Now you go too far.
You shall be punished.

236
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:07,832
No! Please, uh,
Your Highness.

237
00:20:07,867 --> 00:20:10,747
She's ill. She's very ill.
We beg your forgiveness.

238
00:20:10,782 --> 00:20:12,912
- Please, Miriam, let us go.
- No, Aaron.

239
00:20:12,947 --> 00:20:16,067
Our mother set you adrift
in a basket to save your life!

240
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,112
Save my life?
From who?

241
00:20:18,147 --> 00:20:20,307
Ask the man
that you call "Father".

242
00:20:21,707 --> 00:20:25,232
- How dare you?
- God saved you to be our deliverer.

243
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:29,147
- Enough of this.
- And you are, Moses. You are the deliverer.

244
00:20:29,182 --> 00:20:30,947
I said, enough!

245
00:20:32,587 --> 00:20:34,987
You will regret this night.

They might have risen
against us.

278
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:53,547
Father, tell me
you didn't do this.

279
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:56,152
Moses,

280
00:25:56,187 --> 00:26:00,307
sometimes,
for the greater good,

281
00:26:00,342 --> 00:26:03,587
sacrifices must be made.

282
00:26:10,267 --> 00:26:12,227
Sacrifices?

283
00:26:15,187 --> 00:26:17,792
Oh, my son.

284
00:26:18,522 --> 00:26:21,067
They were only slaves.

285
00:26:38,347 --> 00:26:41,112
Moses?

286
00:26:41,147 --> 00:26:43,832
Is this where you found me?

287
00:26:43,867 --> 00:26:47,387
Moses, please try
to understand.

288
00:26:50,387 --> 00:26:54,407
So... So everything
I thought,

289
00:26:54,442 --> 00:26:58,427
everything I am, is a lie.

290
00:26:58,462 --> 00:27:00,192
No.

291
00:27:00,227 --> 00:27:03,787
You are our son,
and we love you.

292
00:27:05,227 --> 00:27:07,787
Why did you choose me?

293
00:27:08,447 --> 00:27:10,869
We didn't, Moses.

294
00:27:10,904 --> 00:27:13,292

Last night, the gods
granted me a vision.

304
00:28:06,547 --> 00:28:10,747
I'm not merely going to restore
this temple, I will make it more grand,

305
00:28:10,782 --> 00:28:14,107
more splendid
than any other one in Egypt.

306
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:38,336
- Get up!
- Aah!

307
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:46,752
Moses! Look.

308
00:28:46,787 --> 00:28:50,907
Fate has turned our little misadventure
into a great opportunity.

309
00:28:50,942 --> 00:28:53,547
- Get up, old man!
- Father will be so pleased...

310
00:28:53,582 --> 00:28:57,587
Put your back into it!

311
00:28:57,622 --> 00:29:00,312
Faster!

312
00:29:00,347 --> 00:29:02,312
And this is just the beginning.

313
00:29:02,347 --> 00:29:06,067
A gateway will open to an entire
new city of white limestone,

314
00:29:06,102 --> 00:29:08,284
more dazzling than the sun.

315
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:10,467
And here, a statue of Hapi.

316
00:29:10,502 --> 00:29:12,272
I said, hurry!

317
00:29:12,307 --> 00:29:14,992
- ...two great column halls.
- Stop it!

318
00:29:15,027 --> 00:29:17,347
- Somebody's got to stop this!
- There's nothing we can do.

319
00:29:28,827 --> 00:29:30,712
Stop it.

320
00:29:30,747 --> 00:29:32,632
Stop. Stop it!

321
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:36,187
- Leave that man alone!
- Moses!

322
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:50,467
Out of my way.
Out of my way. Move!

323
00:29:50,993 --> 00:29:52,311
Who did this?

324
00:29:53,081 --> 00:29:57,041
Up there! It's him.
Up there.

325
00:30:09,138 --> 00:30:10,578
Moses!

326
00:30:21,227 --> 00:30:24,187
Moses, what's going on?
Moses!

327
00:30:31,907 --> 00:30:34,467
Moses!

328
00:30:35,987 --> 00:30:37,932
- Moses!
- Let me go!

329
00:30:37,979 --> 00:30:42,067
- No, wait.
- You saw what happened. I just killed a man.

330
00:30:42,102 --> 00:30:44,592
We can take care of that.

331
00:30:44,627 --> 00:30:46,792
I will make it
so it never happened.

332
00:30:46,827 --> 00:30:50,007
Nothing you can say
can change what I've done.

333
00:30:50,042 --> 00:30:52,974
I am Egypt, the morning
and the evening star.

334
00:30:53,009 --> 00:30:55,907
If I say day is night,
it will be written,

335
00:30:55,942 --> 00:30:58,747
and you will be
what I say you are.

336
00:30:58,782 --> 00:31:00,832
I say you are innocent.

337
00:31:00,867 --> 00:31:04,467
What you say does not matter.
You don't understand.

338
00:31:05,251 --> 00:31:06,783
I can't stay here any longer.

339
00:31:06,827 --> 00:31:08,637
- Moses!
- No!

340
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:12,728
All I've ever known
to be true is a lie.

341
00:31:14,307 --> 00:31:16,625
I'm not who you think I am.

342
00:31:16,695 --> 00:31:19,165
What are you talking about?

343
00:31:19,427 --> 00:31:23,067
Go ask the man
I once called "Father".

344
00:31:25,747 --> 00:31:28,707
Moses?

345
00:31:30,478 --> 00:31:32,358
Please.

346
00:31:38,467 --> 00:31:40,907
Good-bye, brother.

347
00:31:45,627 --> 00:31:47,587
Moses!

348
00:31:48,707 --> 00:31:50,627
Moses!

349
00:34:02,478 --> 00:34:04,187
Hey, wait.

350
00:34:05,747 --> 00:34:07,707
Please.

351
00:34:30,147 --> 00:34:32,032
What are you doing?

352
00:34:32,067 --> 00:34:35,027
- Help!
- Let our sheep drink!

353
00:34:35,062 --> 00:34:37,987
Leave us alone!
Get away!

354
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,352
Stop it!

355
00:34:42,387 --> 00:34:44,807
My father's
the high priest of Midian.

356
00:34:44,842 --> 00:34:47,227
You're going to be
in big trouble.

357
00:34:47,262 --> 00:34:50,152
- Aah!
- Hey, you.

358
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:53,670
Aren't these your camels?

359
00:34:54,027 --> 00:34:56,667
- Hut-hut!
- No, no! No, no!

360
00:34:56,702 --> 00:34:58,987
- Wait!
- Wait, stop!

361
00:35:05,427 --> 00:35:07,347
Whoa!

362
00:35:15,111 --> 00:35:16,512
What are you girls doing?

363
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:19,027
We're trying to get the funny man
out of the well.

364
00:35:19,062 --> 00:35:21,624
Trying to get the funny man
out of the well.

365
00:35:21,659 --> 00:35:24,683
Well, that's one
I've never heard before.

366
00:35:24,718 --> 00:35:27,707
Oh, my.
Oh, uh, don't worry down there!

367
00:35:27,742 --> 00:35:29,827
Uh, we'll get you out.
Hold on!

368
00:35:35,113 --> 00:35:36,207
You.

369
00:35:47,507 --> 00:35:51,547
That's why Papa says
she'll never get married.

370
00:35:55,147 --> 00:35:59,187
You don't have to do this. Ladies,
please, I'm really... I'm really quite...

371
00:35:59,222 --> 00:36:01,139
No, not there, please.

372
00:36:01,185 --> 00:36:04,226
That tickles. Ladies,
you've cleaned every inch of me.

373
00:36:04,262 --> 00:36:06,312
Whoa, I... I was wrong.

374
00:36:06,347 --> 00:36:10,027
Let me through. Let me through.
I want to see him.

375
00:36:10,062 --> 00:36:13,872
Ah! You are most welcome.

376
00:36:13,907 --> 00:36:16,467
You should not be
a stranger in this land.

377
00:36:16,502 --> 00:36:18,912
You have been sent
as a blessing.

378
00:36:18,947 --> 00:36:22,147
And tonight, you shall
be my honoured guest.

379
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:27,947
My father, Jethro,
High Priest of Midian.

380
00:36:36,847 --> 00:36:39,107
Psst. Sit with me.

381
00:36:39,142 --> 00:36:41,827
Um, all right.

382
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:47,032
Psst. Not yet.

383
00:36:47,067 --> 00:36:50,513
- Oh, sorry.
- My children,

384
00:36:50,576 --> 00:36:53,907
let us give thanks
for this bountiful food.

385
00:36:55,027 --> 00:36:57,632
And let us also give thanks
for the presence...

386
00:36:57,667 --> 00:37:01,467
of this brave, young man
whom we honour here tonight.

387
00:37:03,259 --> 00:37:05,592
Please, sir, I wish you wouldn't.

388
00:37:05,627 --> 00:37:08,707
I've done nothing in my life
worth honouring.

389
00:37:12,307 --> 00:37:15,632
First, you rescue Tzipporah
from Egypt,

390
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:18,667
then you defend my younger
daughters from brigands.

391
00:37:18,702 --> 00:37:21,752
You think that is nothing?

392
00:37:21,787 --> 00:37:25,267

476
00:44:01,579 --> 00:44:04,267
<i>I shall teach you what to say.</i>

477
00:44:04,302 --> 00:44:07,312
<i>Let my people go!</i>

478
00:44:07,347 --> 00:44:09,472
But I was their enemy.

479
00:44:09,507 --> 00:44:13,947
I was the prince of Egypt, the son of
the man who slaughtered their children.

480
00:44:13,982 --> 00:44:16,484
You've... You've chosen
the wrong messenger.

481
00:44:16,519 --> 00:44:18,987
H... How can I even speak
to these people?

482
00:44:19,022 --> 00:44:21,552
<i>Who made man's mouth?</i>

483
00:44:21,587 --> 00:44:25,467
<i>Who made the deaf, the mute,
the seeing or the blind?</i>

484
00:44:25,502 --> 00:44:28,307
<i>Did not I?
Now go!</i>

485
00:44:40,467 --> 00:44:43,472
<i>Oh, Moses,</i>

486
00:44:43,507 --> 00:44:48,267
<i>I shall be with you when you
go to the king of Egypt.</i>

487
00:44:48,302 --> 00:44:50,907
<i>But Pharaoh will not listen.</i>

488
00:44:54,547 --> 00:44:57,747
<i>So I will stretch out
My hand...</i>

489
00:44:57,782 --> 00:45:00,224
<i>and smite Egypt...</i>

490
00:45:00,259 --> 00:45:02,667
<i>with all My wonders.</i>

491
00:45:06,467 --> 00:45:10,747
<i>Take the staff
in your hand, Moses.</i>

492
00:45:10,782 --> 00:45:12,672
<i>With it,</i>

493
00:45:12,707 --> 00:45:16,627
<i>you shall do My wonders.</i>

494
00:45:20,787 --> 00:45:23,587
<i>I shall be with you, Moses.</i>

495
00:45:25,239 --> 00:45:27,307
<i>Moses.</i>

496
00:45:28,787 --> 00:45:30,907
<i>Moses.</i>

497
00:46:47,307 --> 00:46:49,312
But, Moses,

498
00:46:49,347 --> 00:46:52,147
you are just one man.

499
00:46:55,578 --> 00:46:57,418
Tzipporah,

500
00:46:59,067 --> 00:47:01,747
please.

501
00:47:08,347 --> 00:47:10,787
Look at your family.

502
00:47:13,467 --> 00:47:16,232
They are free.

503
00:47:16,267 --> 00:47:18,312
They have a future.

504
00:47:18,347 --> 00:47:20,952
They have hopes and dreams...

505
00:47:20,987 --> 00:47:24,067
and the promise
of a life with dignity.

506
00:47:26,467 --> 00:47:29,467
That is what I want
for my people.

507
00:47:30,707 --> 00:47:33,267
And that is why
I must do the task...

508
00:47:33,302 --> 00:47:36,427
that God has given me.

509
00:47:47,883 --> 00:47:50,323
I'm coming with you.

510
00:49:14,995 --> 00:49:16,800
Rameses.

511
00:49:17,546 --> 00:49:20,866
Moses?
Is it really?

512
00:49:25,743 --> 00:49:26,868
Moses!

513
00:49:26,972 --> 00:49:29,372
- Rameses!
- Where have you been? I took you for dead.

514
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:34,592
Look at you!
Pharaoh.

515
00:49:34,627 --> 00:49:38,067
Well, look at you.
What on earth are you dressed as?

516
00:49:39,387 --> 00:49:42,707
Oh, Rameses,
it's so good to see you.

517
00:49:42,742 --> 00:49:44,552
Excuse me, Your Majesty.

518
00:49:45,368 --> 00:49:49,827
We are compelled to remind you this man
committed a serious crime against the gods.

519
00:49:49,862 --> 00:49:51,454
We are loathe
to bring it up, mind you.

520
00:49:51,506 --> 00:49:54,444
Yet the law clearly states
the punishment for such a crime:

521
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,667
- Death!
- We hesitate to say it.

522
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:59,947
Be still.
Pharaoh speaks.

523
00:50:00,907 --> 00:50:03,947
I am the morning
and the evening star.

524
00:50:03,981 --> 00:50:05,324
Rameses.

525
00:50:05,364 --> 00:50:07,952
It shall be as I say.

526
00:50:07,987 --> 00:50:12,387
I pardon forever all crimes
of which he stands accused...

527
00:50:12,422 --> 00:50:14,827
and will have it known
that he is...

528
00:50:14,862 --> 00:50:16,964
our brother Moses,

529
00:50:16,999 --> 00:50:19,067
the prince of Egypt.

530
00:50:23,067 --> 00:50:24,987
Rameses,

531
00:50:25,987 --> 00:50:28,887
in my heart,
you are my brother,

532
00:50:28,922 --> 00:50:31,787
but things cannot be
as they were.

533
00:50:31,822 --> 00:50:34,027
I see no reason why not.

534
00:50:35,427 --> 00:50:40,227
You know I am a Hebrew, and the God
of the Hebrews came to me.

535
00:50:40,809 --> 00:50:42,552
What?

536
00:50:42,587 --> 00:50:45,227
He commands that you
let His people go.

537
00:50:49,914 --> 00:50:52,554
Commands?

538
00:50:56,107 --> 00:50:59,827
Behold... the power of God.

539
00:51:14,483 --> 00:51:17,107
Well, uh, impressive.

540
00:51:17,142 --> 00:51:19,472
Hmm.

541
00:51:19,507 --> 00:51:23,747
Very well, Moses.
I'll play along.

542
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:26,072
Hotep. Huy.

543
00:51:26,107 --> 00:51:30,219
Give this snake charmer
our answer.

544

All right, Moses.
I know you.

601
00:54:42,662 --> 00:54:45,387
What's this really about?

602
00:54:46,894 --> 00:54:49,694
Rameses, look.

603
00:54:50,377 --> 00:54:53,142
What do you see?

604
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:59,227
A greater Egypt
than that of my father.

605
00:54:59,262 --> 00:55:01,792
That is not what I see.

606
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:06,232
Moses, I cannot
change what you see.

607
00:55:06,267 --> 00:55:09,707
I have to maintain
the ancient traditions.

608
00:55:09,742 --> 00:55:12,884
I bear the weight
of my father's crown.

609
00:55:13,114 --> 00:55:16,222
Do you still not understand
what Seti was?

610
00:55:16,475 --> 00:55:19,565
He was a great leader.

611
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:22,707
His hands bore the blood
of thousands of children.

612
00:55:22,742 --> 00:55:24,280
Hmph.
Slaves.

613
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:26,152
My people.

614
00:55:26,187 --> 00:55:30,387
And I can no longer hide
in the desert while they suffer...

615
00:55:30,422 --> 00:55:32,507
at your hands.

616
00:55:35,307 --> 00:55:37,792
So...

617
00:55:37,827 --> 00:55:40,447
you have returned...

618
00:55:40,825 --> 00:55:43,410
only to free them.

619
00:55:53,187 --> 00:55:55,467
I'm sorry.

620
00:56:03,467 --> 00:56:05,427
Yes.

621
00:56:06,907 --> 00:56:09,827
I had hoped...

622
00:56:23,587 --> 00:56:25,547
I do not know this god.

623
00:56:26,587 --> 00:56:28,627
Neither will I
let your people go.

624
00:56:29,185 --> 00:56:31,204
Rameses, please,
you must listen...

625
00:56:31,239 --> 00:56:33,747
I will not be the weak link!

626
00:56:41,107 --> 00:56:43,927
Tell your people as of today...

627
00:56:43,962 --> 00:56:46,747
their workload
has been doubled,

628
00:56:46,782 --> 00:56:48,627
thanks to your god.

629
00:56:50,539 --> 00:56:52,827
Or is it thanks...

630
00:56:52,862 --> 00:56:54,707
to you?

631
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:03,230
It's Moses.

632
00:57:04,107 --> 00:57:06,367
Moses! Ohh.

633
00:57:07,370 --> 00:57:08,592
So, Moses,

634
00:57:08,627 --> 00:57:12,067
how does it feel when you
get struck to the ground?

635
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:16,267
I didn't mean
to cause you more pain.

636
00:57:16,302 --> 00:57:19,072
I'm just trying to do
as God told me.

637
00:57:19,107 --> 00:57:22,712
God? When did God start
caring about any of us?

638
00:57:23,114 --> 00:57:26,832
In fact, Moses, when did you start
caring about slaves?

639
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:29,267
Was it when you found out
that you were one of us?

640
00:57:29,302 --> 00:57:31,512
Don't listen to him.

641
00:57:31,551 --> 00:57:34,272
No, he's...
He's right.

642
00:57:34,307 --> 00:57:38,192
I did not see because
I did not wish to see.

643
00:57:38,227 --> 00:57:41,072
Oh, you didn't see because
you didn't wish to see.

644
00:57:41,107 --> 00:57:44,147
Ah! Well, that makes everything
fine then, doesn't it?

645
00:57:44,182 --> 00:57:45,719
Aaron!

646
00:57:45,776 --> 00:57:48,216
You shame yourself.

647
00:57:50,227 --> 00:57:53,267
Miriam.

648
00:57:55,147 --> 00:57:57,747
I'm so sorry.

649
00:58:06,479 --> 00:58:08,232
Moses,

650
00:58:08,267 --> 00:58:10,592
hear what I say.

651
00:58:10,627 --> 00:58:12,947
I have been a slave...

652
00:58:12,982 --> 00:58:14,912
all my life,

653
00:58:14,947 --> 00:58:18,939
and God has never
answered my prayers until now.

654
00:58:19,011 --> 00:58:20,955
God saved you from the river,

655
00:58:21,027 --> 00:58:23,872
He saved you
in all your wanderings,

656
00:58:23,907 --> 00:58:27,067
and even now He saves you
from the wrath of Pharaoh.

657
00:58:27,906 --> 00:58:30,751
God will not abandon you,

658
00:58:31,227 --> 00:58:33,667
so don't you abandon us.

659
00:59:04,987 --> 00:59:07,427
Miriam.
Where are you going?

660
00:59:07,462 --> 00:59:09,347
M-Miriam.

661
00:59:22,643 --> 00:59:25,187
The ball disappears.
Where is it? In his hand.

662
00:59:28,467 --> 00:59:30,347
Rameses!

663
00:59:31,968 --> 00:59:34,728
Let my people go!

664
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:39,107
Still gnawing away
at that bone, are we?

665
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:40,592
Carry on.

666
00:59:40,627 --> 00:59:42,752
You cannot keep ignoring us.

667
00:59:42,787 --> 00:59:46,947
Enough! I will hear no more
of this Hebrew nonsense.

668
00:59:46,982 --> 00:59:48,787
Bring him to me.

669
00:59:50,547 --> 00:59:52,627
- Moses!
- No!

670
01:00:05,532 --> 01:00:09,492
<i>Take the staff
in your hand, Moses.</i>

671
01:00:37,192 --> 01:00:38,312
Father.

672
01:00:38,347 --> 01:00:40,447
- It's...
- Blood!

673
01:00:40,482 --> 01:00:42,547
Blood! Oh, blood!

674
01:00:52,907 --> 01:00:56,552
Hotep! Huy!
Explain this to me!

675
01:00:57,024 --> 01:00:59,032
- Ah!
- Rest assured, Your Majesty.

676
01:00:59,067 --> 01:01:01,987
Uh, yes, we were going to
demonstrate the superior might...

677
01:01:02,022 --> 01:01:03,827
of our gods.

678
01:01:03,862 --> 01:01:05,347
Uh.

679
01:01:06,987 --> 01:01:09,867
By the power of Ra!

680
01:01:24,907 --> 01:01:27,827
Abandon this futile mission,
Moses.

681
01:01:28,385 --> 01:01:31,164
I've indulged you long enough.

682
01:01:31,199 --> 01:01:34,467
This must now be finished.

683
01:01:36,467 --> 01:01:38,632
No, Rameses.

684
01:01:38,667 --> 01:01:40,912
It is only beginning.

685
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:44,067
But, Moses, d-didn't you
see what happened?

686
01:01:44,102 --> 01:01:46,712
The priests did the same thing.

687
01:01:46,747 --> 01:01:49,667
Pharaoh still has the power
over our lives.

688
01:01:52,147 --> 01:01:55,587
Yes, Aaron, it's true.
Pharaoh has the power.

689
01:01:57,335 --> 01:02:02,085
He can take away your food,
your home, your freedom.

690
01:02:02,156 --> 01:02:06,640
He can take away
your sons and daughters.

691
01:02:06,704 --> 01:02:08,794
With one word,

692
01:02:08,947 --> 01:02:11,907
Pharaoh can take away
your very lives.

693
01:02:13,747 --> 01:02:17,627
But there is one thing
he cannot take away from you:

694
01:02:17,662 --> 01:02:19,467
your faith.

695
01:02:21,707 --> 01:02:23,592
Believe,

696
01:02:23,627 --> 01:02:26,387
for we will see God's wonders.

01:05:47,787 --> 01:05:49,832
Rameses?

751
01:05:49,867 --> 01:05:51,827
Oh. Let me guess.

752
01:05:53,347 --> 01:05:55,650
You want me to...

753
01:05:55,704 --> 01:05:58,289
let your people go.

754
01:06:01,267 --> 01:06:03,667
I hoped I would find you here.

755
01:06:03,702 --> 01:06:06,067
Get out!

756
01:06:07,587 --> 01:06:12,187
Rameses, we must
bring this to an end.

757
01:06:16,947 --> 01:06:20,087
Rameses, please, talk to me.

758
01:06:20,512 --> 01:06:23,617
We could always talk here.

759
01:06:32,107 --> 01:06:34,027
This place.

760
01:06:35,467 --> 01:06:37,427
So many memories.

761
01:06:40,627 --> 01:06:43,192
I remember the time you...

762
01:06:43,227 --> 01:06:46,667
switched the heads of the gods
of the temple of Ra.

763
01:06:50,307 --> 01:06:52,192
If I recall correctly,

764
01:06:52,227 --> 01:06:56,587
you were there switching heads
right along with me.

765
01:06:57,427 --> 01:06:59,834
No, it was you.
I didn't do that.

766
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:00,779
Oh, yes, you did.

767
01:07:00,866 --> 01:07:03,701
You put the hippo on the crocodile,
and the crocodile...

768
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:06,312
- On the falcon.
- Yes!

769
01:07:06,346 --> 01:07:09,362
And the priest thought it was a horrible
omen and fasted for two months.

770
01:07:09,486 --> 01:07:12,651
Father was furious. You were
always getting me into trouble.

771
01:07:19,638 --> 01:07:21,598
But then...

772
01:07:23,472 --> 01:07:26,592
you were always there to...

773
01:07:26,822 --> 01:07:29,907
get me out of trouble again.

774
01:07:29,942 --> 01:07:31,747
Hmph.

775
01:07:36,027 --> 01:07:39,427
Why can't things be
the way they were before?

776
01:07:40,827 --> 01:07:42,472
Father.

777
01:07:43,451 --> 01:07:45,371
It's so dark.

778
01:07:46,495 --> 01:07:48,815
I'm frightened.

779
01:07:49,251 --> 01:07:51,091
Why is he here?

780
01:07:54,347 --> 01:07:57,267
Isn't that the man
who did all this?

781
01:07:58,987 --> 01:08:01,352
Yes.

782
01:08:01,387 --> 01:08:04,307
But one must wonder...

783
01:08:04,342 --> 01:08:06,072
why.

784
01:08:06,575 --> 01:08:11,032
Because no kingdom should be made
on the backs of slaves.

785
01:08:11,066 --> 01:08:15,113
Rameses, your stubbornness
is bringing this misery upon Egypt.

786
01:08:15,161 --> 01:08:18,384
It would cease if only you
would let the Hebrews go.

787
01:08:18,419 --> 01:08:21,044
I will not be dictated to.
I will not be threatened.

788
01:08:21,083 --> 01:08:24,992
I am the morning
and the evening star. I am Pharaoh.

789
01:08:25,027 --> 01:08:28,935
Something else is coming. Something
much worse than anything before.

790
01:08:28,989 --> 01:08:32,144
Please, let go of
your contempt for life...

791
01:08:32,179 --> 01:08:34,366
before it destroys
everything you hold dear.

792
01:08:34,429 --> 01:08:36,468
Think of your son!

793
01:08:37,142 --> 01:08:38,952
I do.

794
01:08:38,987 --> 01:08:41,992
You Hebrews have been
