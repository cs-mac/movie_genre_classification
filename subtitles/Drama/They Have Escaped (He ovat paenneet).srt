1
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:39,122
The following is a true story.

2
00:00:39,207 --> 00:00:45,045
I present it as it happened,
without adornment.

3
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:51,885
AT THIS SITE

4
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:54,930
UNDER GERMAN OCCUPATION,

5
00:00:55,014 --> 00:00:57,390
10,000 MEN SUFFERED,

6
00:00:57,475 --> 00:01:00,477
VICTIMS OF THE NAZIS.

7
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:03,271
7,000 PASSED AWAY.

8
00:01:14,617 --> 00:01:19,746
A MAN ESCAPED

9
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:22,207
OR

10
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:27,128
THE WIND BLOWS WHERE IT WISHES

11
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:31,216
Based on the Narrative by

12
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:35,887
Script and Dialogue by

13
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:40,892
Cinematography by

14
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:25,098
Thank you, Officers.

15
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:40,864
Stay here.

16
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,964
Damned dog!

17
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:01,217
We forbid you to make
another escape attempt!

18
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:03,261
Let's go!

19
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:15,773
This will teach you to stay
nice and quiet for a few days!

20
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,782
I could feel
I was being watched.

21
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,700
I didn't dare budge.

22
00:06:32,643 --> 00:06:35,603
Nothing broken, but I probably
wasn't a pretty sight.

23
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,401
I wiped myself off as best I could.

24
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:46,281
The charges against me were so severe
and I'd aggravated them so clearly.

25
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:48,491
Why hadn't they shot me?

26
00:06:48,576 --> 00:06:51,578
While waiting in the courtyard,
I'd gotten used to the idea of death.

27
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:54,163
I would have preferred
an immediate execution.

28
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:07,510
The tapping of my neighbor
was of no help.

29
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:11,180
I even lost courage
for a moment and cried.

30
00:07:14,852 --> 00:07:18,438
I slept so deeply that the guards
had to wake me at daybreak.

31
00:07:26,405 --> 00:07:28,072
Get up.

32
00:07:29,408 --> 00:07:31,075
Get up!

33
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:40,043
Instinctively, I pretended
not to be able to get up

34
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:43,296
and made a show
of tremendous effort just to sit up.

35
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:57,060
Did I owe my life
to this meager deception?

36
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,811
That's enough.

37
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:10,323
They beat me back with feet and fists
and I found myself alone.

38
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:18,414
My cell was hardly nine feet by six feet.

39
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:20,667
The furnishings were rudimentary.

40
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:24,295
A wood frame supporting
the mattress and two blankets.

41
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:33,096
In a recess near the door
was a slop pail.

42
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:36,015
Finally, fixed to the wall
was a stone shelf.

43
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:42,021
I managed to climb onto this shelf
to reach the window.

44
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:55,743
In the small courtyard
that extended before me

45
00:08:55,828 --> 00:08:58,121
three comfortably dressed
and clean shaven men were walking

46
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:00,206
apparently without supervision.

47
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,385
Pay close attention.
I'll be back.

48
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:31,821
- Your name?
- Fontaine.

49
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,239
I'm Terry.

50
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,324
Any way to send word out?

51
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:37,368
I have a way.

52
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,915
Nonetheless,
I knew I had to be wary.

53
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,593
Catch.

54
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,772
Now that a stranger
had told me "I have a way,"

55
00:10:05,856 --> 00:10:08,357
everything had changed for me.

56
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:20,578
Out.

57
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:24,332
Out! Come!

58
00:10:31,507 --> 00:10:33,674
In spite of my handcuffs,
I was able to wash up

59
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,593
and clean my wounds.

60
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,643
Out!

61
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,242
Soon, I'd managed to communicate
with my neighbor.

62
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,118
A young worker at a bronze foundry,

63
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:03,204
he had killed a German soldier
during a quarrel.

64
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:06,123
He was to be executed any day.
He was 19.

65
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:17,051
With the string they'd given me
and my handkerchief,

66
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,470
I fashioned a kind of a sack.

67
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,104
Tomorrow give me your letters.

68
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:58,175
May 2nd, Dear Mother,
I'm in prison...

69
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,596
To reassure my family
and give them a hope I did not possess.

70
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,472
Yes, and especially to warn my superiors

71
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:05,600
that the post transmitter
I was in charge of

72
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:08,394
was aiding the Germans
as they'd cracked the code.

73
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,771
I was determined to run the risk.

74
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:12,690
And what a risk.

75
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,444
Trusting my letters to a stranger

76
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:20,281
could mean the end for me
as well as the recipients.

77
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:28,414
We could also be seen in the courtyard
or interrupted at any moment.

78
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:36,797
Got a safety pin?

79
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:38,674
A safety pin?

80
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,259
Wait.

81
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:45,097
He walked off toward the building
that housed the women.

82
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:12,458
This is from them.

83
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:26,931
On the paper, written in a feminine hand,
was the word "courage."

84
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,642
There was also a safety pin.

85
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,565
My neighbor had taught me the method.

86
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:39,819
But it didn't work right away
and I hardly believed it would.

87
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:44,532
PRESS, PULL OUT,
KEYHOLE, MECHANISM

88
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,422
I could finally relax
my stiff arms and wrists.

89
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:02,174
I felt a sudden sense of victory.

90
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,263
As a special exception,

91
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:10,307
the head guard allowed Terry
to see his daughter on certain days.

92
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:12,059
I wasn't aware of it until much later.

93
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:15,604
I was far from suspecting the danger
to himself and to her.

94
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:19,191
When she returned home, the letters were
sealed, stamped and dropped in the box.

95
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:23,529
Your letters went out yesterday.
They should have arrived by now.

96
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:24,697
Thank you.

97
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:44,133
You've done your duty.
That will help you hold out.

98
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,468
Look.

99
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,640
Be careful.

100
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:10,326
Well, Lieutenant Fontaine.

101
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:14,330
Have you come to terms
with your defeat?

102
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:21,837
I'll be frank. In your place,
I would've jumped out of the car myself.

103
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:27,051
But now you'll give me your word
that you won't try to escape again.

104
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:29,887
I give you my word.

105
00:15:31,223 --> 00:15:32,848
Who were we kidding?

106
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,767
He certainly didn't believe me.

107
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:38,187
As for myself, I was determined
to escape at the first opportunity.

108
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:51,826
Did he hope to see a starving man
throw himself onto his meager scraps?

109
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:06,048
My first meal in four days.

110
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:10,678
My visits to the window
grew longer and longer.

111
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:13,722
I could see the courtyard,
the walls and the infirmary yard.

112
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,766
I unconsciously prepared myself.

113
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:31,282
I knew they conducted executions
within the prison compound.

114
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:33,367
A crazy thought crossed my mind.

115
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:44,461
He was there.

116
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:49,049
I stayed up into the night teaching him
the Bataillonaire's march he'd asked for.

117
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:51,760
What does it matter? Who cares?
All young guys who never had much luck.

118
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:54,013
It was the only help
I could give him.

119
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,268
The next day
the head guard came for me.

120
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:14,617
Jacket.

121
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:18,954
Towel.

122
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:28,023
I had left the ground floor for good.
I was now in cell 107 on the top floor.

123
00:18:47,836 --> 00:18:50,045
Everyone out!

124
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:52,047
Everyone out!

125
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:06,228
Nobody to my right.
The cell was empty.

126
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:09,481
To my left, a neighbor
who hadn't replied.

127
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:48,604
I tried to read on their faces
what kind of men they might be.

128
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,856
I also studied the walls.

129
00:19:56,446 --> 00:19:57,780
Get in yesterday?

130
00:19:57,864 --> 00:19:59,907
I was downstairs for 15 days...

131
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:00,949
or 15 years!

132
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:02,701
You get used to it.

133
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,788
Yes, I assure you.

134
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:08,248
The name's Hbrard.

135
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,292
No talking!

136
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:12,044
I'm Fontaine.

137
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,482
Time to empty our slop pails
and run a little water over our faces,

138
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:36,235
then back to our cells for the entire day.

139
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,683
With nothing to do, no news
and in terrible solitude,

140
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:10,727
we were 100 unfortunates
awaiting our fate.

141
00:21:10,812 --> 00:21:13,605
I had no illusions about my own.

142
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,774
If I could only escape, run away.

143
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:22,448
It was chance or idleness
that gave me my first break.

144
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:25,868
I often sat across from my door

145
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:28,871
with nothing better to do
than let my gaze wander.

146
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:38,213
It was made of two panels
of six oak boards

147
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:40,424
held within a frame
of the same thickness.

148
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:45,220
In the gap between two boards,
I saw that the joining wood was not oak,

149
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:47,639
but wood of another color,
beech or poplar.

150
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:51,602
There would surely be a way
to take the door apart.

151
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:07,451
To get an iron spoon...

152
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:10,037
tin or aluminum
being too soft or too brittle...

153
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:12,623
I had to wait through
several meals.

154
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:39,775
I made a kind of chisel from it.

155
00:22:53,122 --> 00:22:56,166
No, the boards weren't joined
by mortise and tenon joints

156
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:57,751
carved into the oak itself,

157
00:22:57,835 --> 00:23:01,296
but by strips of soft wood
my tool could easily tackle.

158
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:05,968
I estimated that it would take four
or five days to make it through a strip

159
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:08,720
by cutting or chipping the wood.

160
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:19,481
But every evening at the same time,
I also had to get some air.

161
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:42,254
Progress was slow
due to my fear of making noise

162
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:44,923
and the constant threat
of being taken by surprise.

163
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,481
Moreover, I had to keep
brushing under the doorway

164
00:24:01,566 --> 00:24:04,401
with a bit of straw
torn from the cell broom.

165
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:34,556
Fontaine, are you there?

166
00:24:38,895 --> 00:24:40,562
Is that you, Terry?

167
00:24:41,314 --> 00:24:43,815
We meet again.
How I've missed you.

168
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:46,902
I'm leaving.

169
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,071
Are they releasing you?

170
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:51,114
They're taking me away,
lord knows where.

171
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:59,331
How he could evade surveillance
and come to my door, I'd never know.

172
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:04,002
My neighbor downstairs?

173
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:07,297
Executed day before yesterday.

174
00:25:07,382 --> 00:25:09,049
Good-bye.

175
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:16,431
Terry's departure and the death
of a comrade I had never seen

176
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:18,850
left me in distress.

177
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:25,065
Nevertheless, I carried on with my work.
It prevented me from thinking.

178
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:29,528
The door just had to open.
I had no plans for afterwards.

179
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,657
A new arrival, the Pastor de Leyris

180
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:36,410
would earn my trust,
fulfill my need for companionship.

181
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:39,788
They arrested me yesterday right
at the pulpit. No time to take a thing.

182
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,623
Nothing?

183
00:25:41,708 --> 00:25:45,335
I always wanted time alone
with my Bible someday, for meditation.

184
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,504
I don't have a Bible,
but I've got a pencil.

185
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:52,634
That's huge.

186
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:57,264
You need to keep busy.
Write, keep your mind sharp.

187
00:25:58,808 --> 00:26:00,308
I keep myself busy.

188
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:13,196
Three boards should make
a big enough opening.

189
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:44,519
Across from me in 108,
someone kept lookout,

190
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:46,563
which made my work much easier.

191
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:58,074
On the other hand,
my neighbor's silence troubled me.

192
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:12,798
We can speak openly.
They're all downstairs on the other side.

193
00:27:16,636 --> 00:27:18,637
Are you afraid?

194
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:23,809
I knew he was there.
I was sure of it.

195
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:52,796
My neighbor worried me so much
I no longer dared touch my door.

196
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:57,551
I settled for plugging the holes
with paper I blackened on the ground.

197
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:05,327
He threw us a distraught gaze.

198
00:29:06,162 --> 00:29:09,331
And that night at the window, Blanchet...
that was his name...

199
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:15,086
For some dollars, Mr. Blanchet?
Did they belong to you?

200
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:17,672
No, to a Jewish woman.
I'd never seen her before.

201
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:20,216
She gave them to me
the day she was captured.

202
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:21,801
And how did they find out?

203
00:29:21,886 --> 00:29:24,054
From a letter in a bag of laundry.

204
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:25,889
They'll release you.

205
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:26,556
No.

206
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:30,226
- What can I do for you?
- Nothing.

207
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:32,145
There's always something.

208
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:36,900
If you want to help me, stop carving.
You'll get the whole floor punished.

209
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:05,470
After three weeks of effort
making as little noise as possible,

210
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:08,640
I'd managed to separate
three boards along the sides.

211
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:11,476
But they were held in the frame
at the top and the bottom

212
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,771
by joints which bent
the handle of my spoon.

213
00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:46,261
To break apart the edge of the frame,
I'd need to find another spoon.

214
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:48,680
Only then would I have
enough leverage.

215
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:54,269
The Bible.

216
00:30:56,689 --> 00:30:58,064
I'm in luck.

217
00:30:58,149 --> 00:30:58,982
A miracle!

218
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:01,776
Everything has changed
since yesterday.

219
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:04,195
Quiet! No talking!

220
00:31:07,116 --> 00:31:09,034
I'm in luck myself.

221
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:07,425
The frame broke,
but over a bigger area than I'd expected.

222
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:41,835
I was able to put the pieces
back in place and make them stick.

223
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:18,830
Why bother?

224
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:22,500
To fight. To fight the walls,
to fight myself, to fight the door.

225
00:33:23,002 --> 00:33:25,420
You, too, Mr. Blanchet,
should fight and hope.

226
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,172
Hope for what?

227
00:33:27,256 --> 00:33:28,756
To go home, to be free.

228
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:29,966
Free?

229
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:32,594
- Somebody waiting for you?
- Nobody.

230
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:34,012
A friend?

231
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:35,597
I don't have friends.

232
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:38,266
Fight anyway.
Fight for everyone here.

233
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,393
Plus, it helps.
If you only look out for yourself...

234
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:41,895
What else are you doing?

235
00:33:41,979 --> 00:33:44,022
I think of you, Mr. Blanchet,
and it gives me courage.

236
00:33:44,106 --> 00:33:46,774
For me, real courage
would be to kill me.

237
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:49,652
I tried. I made a noose with my laces.
The nail broke.

238
00:33:51,822 --> 00:33:53,156
And then?

239
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,908
I heard tapping on the wall.

240
00:33:54,992 --> 00:33:57,911
That was me when I arrived.
Why didn't you respond?

241
00:33:57,995 --> 00:33:59,996
Why?

242
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:17,972
I was afraid they would open
or close my door forcefully.

243
00:34:18,933 --> 00:34:21,392
Fortunately,
it was up to me to handle it.

244
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:35,490
Okay?

245
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:36,908
Okay.

246
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:48,962
His wife turned him in.
Betrayed him.

247
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,464
These things happen...

248
00:34:52,675 --> 00:34:53,800
In life.

249
00:34:56,053 --> 00:34:57,720
That's horrible.

250
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,265
She doesn't stand much of a chance.

251
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:02,183
He didn't kill her?

252
00:35:02,268 --> 00:35:03,518
He nearly did.

253
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,186
When he got here,
we thought he'd go mad.

254
00:35:05,271 --> 00:35:07,230
And now he's just another man.

255
00:35:07,982 --> 00:35:11,484
His face shows neither hatred
nor even suffering anymore.

256
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:13,653
He's called Orsini.

257
00:35:20,494 --> 00:35:22,161
Talking about me, Pastor?

258
00:35:22,246 --> 00:35:24,497
I was saying you're
the bravest man alive.

259
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:55,361
A month of patient work
and the door was open.

260
00:36:42,618 --> 00:36:45,953
It took a lot of time to put it
back in place and camouflage it.

261
00:36:58,509 --> 00:37:01,010
Inside the building,
no patrols, no guards.

262
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:22,240
Getting into the hallway
wasn't that big of a deal.

263
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:38,840
But I also had a goal.

264
00:38:01,655 --> 00:38:07,368
NO EATING, NO EXIT

265
00:38:07,453 --> 00:38:08,953
What's that?

266
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:13,875
It's me, cell 107.

267
00:38:14,543 --> 00:38:16,461
Impossible.

268
00:38:16,545 --> 00:38:19,297
Hold out. If I have to,
I'll come back tomorrow.

269
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:26,637
His surprise pleased me.

270
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:38,065
That night I went to sleep
less miserable.

271
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,779
That was you in the hallway.
Don't deny it.

272
00:38:43,864 --> 00:38:44,864
It was me.

273
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:47,742
You're leaving.
How will you do it?

274
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:50,328
I don't have the slightest idea.

275
00:39:48,971 --> 00:39:52,223
The head guard and the sergeant
slept on the second floor.

276
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:02,733
The corporal slept on the ground floor
near the door to which he had the key.

277
00:40:02,818 --> 00:40:05,319
This door remained locked
throughout the night.

278
00:40:13,662 --> 00:40:16,581
I visualized every possibility
and even what was impossible.

279
00:40:17,082 --> 00:40:19,584
I devised a thousand plans,
but acted on none.

280
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:24,422
Read and pray.
God will save you.

281
00:40:26,008 --> 00:40:28,676
He'll save us
if we give him the chance.

282
00:40:29,553 --> 00:40:30,553
You never pray?

283
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:32,346
Sometimes.

284
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:34,098
When things get bad?

285
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:35,016
Yes.

286
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:38,060
- That's easy.
- Too easy.

287
00:40:39,271 --> 00:40:42,106
It would be too easy
if God saw to everything.

288
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,360
Fontaine, you're the only one
even thinking of escape.

289
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:49,363
The only one because it's impossible.

290
00:40:49,448 --> 00:40:51,115
Take me.

291
00:41:37,746 --> 00:41:39,580
You won't get through.

292
00:41:39,665 --> 00:41:42,750
I have to. In military terms,
it's called reconnaissance.

293
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,544
Be careful.

294
00:41:47,381 --> 00:41:50,049
If I'm not in the hallway by 10:00...

295
00:41:53,053 --> 00:41:55,388
At 10:00 I was under the skylight.

296
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:25,876
I was certain of disaster.

297
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:38,139
The exit route from the building
and how to dismantle your door.

298
00:42:47,482 --> 00:42:49,525
Read it carefully and tear it up.

299
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:52,445
You can count on me,
but I'm not the "bravest man alive."

300
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:56,657
You're able to forgive and forget.
That's something.

301
00:42:56,742 --> 00:42:59,702
I think about it,
but it's like it happened to someone else.

302
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:02,413
Don't worry. Everything will go well.

303
00:43:17,846 --> 00:43:22,475
40 feet of rope strong enough
to hold a man is what I needed.

304
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:50,461
The netting from the bed frame supplied
about 120 feet of flexible and sturdy wire.

305
00:44:05,894 --> 00:44:08,771
I made my first segment of rope
with materials from my pillow.

306
00:44:09,815 --> 00:44:12,650
The little horsehair it contained
went into the mattress.

307
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:37,258
I folded the fabric
I obtained in quarters

308
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:40,678
turning the edges inward
to prevent fraying.

309
00:44:52,482 --> 00:44:54,316
I twisted it tightly.

310
00:45:00,323 --> 00:45:02,783
By wrapping a wire
in the opposite direction

311
00:45:02,868 --> 00:45:04,743
I was able to maintain the tension.

312
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:15,170
Your door?

313
00:45:15,255 --> 00:45:16,589
I'll try again.

314
00:45:17,757 --> 00:45:20,092
Try, Orsini. Try again.

315
00:45:20,176 --> 00:45:22,887
Tomorrow I'll tell you if we should
split up or stick together.

316
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:24,638
What's wrong?

317
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:27,057
Too long, too complicated.

318
00:45:27,142 --> 00:45:28,309
All of it.

319
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:29,768
But it's the only way.

320
00:45:30,395 --> 00:45:31,896
There's another way.

321
00:45:33,523 --> 00:45:34,565
Tell me.

322
00:46:10,352 --> 00:46:13,020
During the walk
with two ropes and two hooks.

323
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:15,773
- What hooks?
- He didn't say.

324
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:19,693
- And the guards in the walkway?
- He waits until they've gone past.

325
00:46:19,778 --> 00:46:21,445
Where does he wait?

326
00:46:21,529 --> 00:46:25,074
On the roof of the bathroom.
He climbs the drainpipe and stays hidden.

327
00:46:25,158 --> 00:46:27,493
By day, he'll be seen from the building.

328
00:46:27,577 --> 00:46:29,495
His plan isn't good.

329
00:46:34,292 --> 00:46:37,628
The next day, I couldn't talk to Orsini.
They took him in for interrogation.

330
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:53,602
The interrogation?

331
00:46:53,687 --> 00:46:56,647
They put you at ease. They threaten you.
You know the system.

332
00:46:56,731 --> 00:46:58,816
Orsini is happy.

333
00:47:02,988 --> 00:47:05,322
- You okay?
- Fine.

334
00:47:05,407 --> 00:47:07,324
You need to keep cool.

335
00:47:07,826 --> 00:47:09,827
- You quitting?
- They'll set me free.

336
00:47:09,911 --> 00:47:11,829
- You believe them?
- Yes.

337
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:16,083
You're right.

338
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:17,668
No talking!

339
00:47:17,752 --> 00:47:20,754
It's always the same.
Can't you keep your mouth shut?

340
00:47:29,431 --> 00:47:31,640
Don't shoot.

341
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:39,982
Orsini.

342
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:46,405
I was so closely watched
for eight days, we lost contact.

343
00:47:54,956 --> 00:47:57,041
What was he doing?
I couldn't make sense of it.

344
00:49:33,555 --> 00:49:35,222
What's the matter?

345
00:49:36,558 --> 00:49:38,725
Where's Orsini?

346
00:49:40,228 --> 00:49:42,146
My God, let him succeed.

347
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:44,148
No talking!

348
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:55,636
Will they shoot me?

349
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,388
Hang in there, Orsini.
Surely not.

350
00:51:00,058 --> 00:51:02,559
My rope broke on the second wall.

351
00:51:03,728 --> 00:51:05,395
You'll need hooks, Fontaine.

352
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:10,400
What hooks? How? With what?

353
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:14,821
The lantern frame.

354
00:51:20,662 --> 00:51:21,828
Careful.

355
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,743
Don't blame yourself.
You couldn't have stopped him.

356
00:52:01,828 --> 00:52:03,495
He couldn't wait any longer.

357
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:05,080
Why not? Out of despair?

358
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:07,708
Too much hope for a new life.

359
00:52:09,043 --> 00:52:10,711
A new life?

360
00:52:10,795 --> 00:52:12,504
Perhaps that's what Christ meant.

361
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:14,840
"Unless one is born again..."

362
00:52:14,924 --> 00:52:16,591
I copied out the passage for you.

363
00:52:18,428 --> 00:52:20,345
These are his words to Nicodemus.

364
00:52:22,015 --> 00:52:24,891
"Nicodemus said unto him,
'How can a man be born when he is old?

365
00:52:24,976 --> 00:52:27,185
Can he enter a second time
into his mother's womb and be born?

366
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:30,564
Jesus answered, 'Do not marvel that
I said to you, You must be born again.

367
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:32,607
The wind blows where it wishes,
and you hear the sound of it,

368
00:52:32,692 --> 00:52:35,027
but cannot tell where it comes from
and where it goes.'"

369
00:52:35,111 --> 00:52:38,280
- You hear me?
- I'm listening.

370
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:40,615
Fire!

371
00:52:44,245 --> 00:52:46,747
- It was him.
- Are you sure?

372
00:52:46,831 --> 00:52:48,040
Sure?

373
00:52:48,124 --> 00:52:50,792
Can you be sure of anything here?

374
00:54:26,681 --> 00:54:28,682
I emptied everything into the drain.

375
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:53,290
The terrace of our building
as well as the compound walls

376
00:54:53,374 --> 00:54:55,459
must have the same ledge.

377
00:55:40,755 --> 00:55:43,006
I had to wait.
I was close to my goal,

378
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:45,425
and the smallest error
could prove fatal.

379
00:55:48,596 --> 00:55:50,430
It’s there.

380
00:55:50,515 --> 00:55:51,515
I see.

381
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:55,602
I knew it was dangerous to descend into
the walkway and climb the second wall.

382
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:56,937
My strength had diminished.

383
00:55:57,021 --> 00:55:59,272
I run a line between the two walls
and I cross over like a monkey

384
00:55:59,357 --> 00:56:01,191
hanging by my hands and feet.

385
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:04,861
Just for that, you need two hooks,
three in total. You have them?

386
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:06,863
I will have them.

387
00:56:06,948 --> 00:56:09,950
Orsini had to blow it
so you could succeed.

388
00:56:10,034 --> 00:56:11,660
That's amazing.

389
00:56:11,744 --> 00:56:13,662
I'm not telling you anything new.

390
00:56:13,746 --> 00:56:18,416
Yes. What's amazing
is that you're the one saying it.

391
00:56:33,641 --> 00:56:37,978
I made the third hook
with the two shortest bars.

392
00:56:38,062 --> 00:56:41,565
It was every bit as sturdy
and functional as the others.

393
00:56:50,157 --> 00:56:52,325
Still using the wire,
I fashioned three loops

394
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:54,911
which I attached
to the foot of each hook.

395
00:57:08,009 --> 00:57:12,178
My tests showed that strong leverage
would not damage the hooks or the loops.

396
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:35,410
Everyone to the courtyard!

397
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:37,329
Everyone to the courtyard!

398
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:48,715
I just saw three of our comrades executed
for smuggling letters out.

399
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:52,427
I've been instructed to tell you that whoever
sends letters will face the same fate.

400
00:57:53,429 --> 00:57:56,389
Those who have a pencil
may turn it in tonight at mealtime.

401
00:57:56,474 --> 00:57:58,308
Starting tomorrow,
we will search the cells

402
00:57:58,392 --> 00:58:00,560
and whoever is found
in possession of a pencil

403
00:58:00,645 --> 00:58:02,604
will immediately
be put against the wall and shot.

404
00:58:05,107 --> 00:58:06,775
Is that understood?

405
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:09,944
Back, march!

406
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:21,247
You turning yours in?

407
00:58:22,041 --> 00:58:23,541
It's better that way.

408
00:58:23,626 --> 00:58:25,669
No talking!

409
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:37,847
Pencil?

410
00:58:37,932 --> 00:58:39,599
No pencil.

411
00:58:45,356 --> 00:58:46,815
What foolishness.

412
00:58:46,899 --> 00:58:48,566
And only in order not to give in.

413
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:54,948
The next day, the thought
of a search paralyzed me.

414
00:59:08,045 --> 00:59:09,713
Package.

415
00:59:36,949 --> 00:59:37,949
A package.

416
00:59:38,033 --> 00:59:40,827
Is this what saved me?
Perhaps.

417
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:42,579
And what a resource!

418
00:59:45,416 --> 00:59:47,250
Too bad. It had to be done.

419
01:00:02,183 --> 01:00:05,852
I made braids just like I'd seen
my mother make with my sister's hair.

420
01:00:15,863 --> 01:00:18,198
Nothing was spared
except for one handkerchief.

421
01:00:23,788 --> 01:00:26,956
With the string,
I made the connections.

422
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:40,094
I would throw this rope from
the compound wall to the exterior wall.

423
01:00:40,179 --> 01:00:41,846
It had to be supple and consistent.

424
01:00:41,931 --> 01:00:43,556
The wire wasn't suitable.

425
01:00:43,641 --> 01:00:45,809
Besides, I had exhausted my supply.

426
01:00:53,734 --> 01:00:57,403
With the blanket Blanchet gave me,
I had enough to finish the other rope.

427
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:12,085
We only went out now
in small groups of about 15.

428
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:13,670
The prison was filling up.

429
01:01:13,754 --> 01:01:16,756
It wasn't uncommon
to see two prisoners per cell.

430
01:01:22,513 --> 01:01:25,431
Others appeared
and disappeared like ghosts.

431
01:01:25,516 --> 01:01:28,017
I even saw one of them
dressed for a wedding.

432
01:01:34,692 --> 01:01:37,193
If Fontaine can go, now's the time.

433
01:01:37,862 --> 01:01:39,529
His case isn't good.

434
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:43,700
- He's a snitch.
- What if he's right?

435
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:46,619
Fontaine talked too much.
He's reckless.

436
01:01:50,374 --> 01:01:52,208
Not too tough, Father?

437
01:01:52,293 --> 01:01:54,544
They put me in with the pastor.

438
01:01:55,296 --> 01:01:57,297
He's a good companion.

439
01:02:07,975 --> 01:02:09,642
You must warn him.

440
01:02:09,727 --> 01:02:12,520
What's going to happen will happen.
There's nothing we can do.

441
01:02:12,605 --> 01:02:13,897
He can.

442
01:02:13,981 --> 01:02:15,648
That's what he says.

443
01:02:20,154 --> 01:02:22,071
Nobody believes it anymore.
You're drawing it out.

444
01:02:22,156 --> 01:02:23,489
Drawing it out?

445
01:02:23,574 --> 01:02:25,491
You're thinking too much.
You keep fiddling.

446
01:02:25,576 --> 01:02:26,868
Me?

447
01:02:26,952 --> 01:02:29,495
Do you really need a second?

448
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:31,539
I'm waiting for an answer.

449
01:02:31,624 --> 01:02:32,624
Who?

450
01:02:32,708 --> 01:02:35,585
Across the way, 110.
He stands up to them. He's got guts.

451
01:02:54,688 --> 01:02:57,357
Your plan is a fairy tale.

452
01:03:02,321 --> 01:03:04,197
After three months,
you're not as strong.

453
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:06,449
You're stronger.
You adapt and adjust.

454
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:08,201
It's a blessing.

455
01:03:08,285 --> 01:03:09,786
Or a trap.

456
01:03:11,288 --> 01:03:13,206
Think you can really make it?

457
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:14,207
I'm ready.

458
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:16,250
Then don't wait too long.

459
01:03:22,591 --> 01:03:24,300
You would follow me.

460
01:03:24,385 --> 01:03:26,052
If I could change my body.

461
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:27,971
We'll meet again.

462
01:03:28,055 --> 01:03:29,722
Maybe in another life.

463
01:03:29,807 --> 01:03:32,266
In this one.
You have to believe it.

464
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:36,020
Believe in your hooks and ropes,
and in yourself. You have doubts.

465
01:03:37,690 --> 01:03:39,774
The hard part is to set out.

466
01:03:53,789 --> 01:03:55,331
Come.

467
01:04:42,629 --> 01:04:45,965
The investigation of your case
has been concluded, Lt. Fontaine.

468
01:04:46,467 --> 01:04:52,305
The charges of espionage and planning
a bomb attack are punishable by death.

469
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:54,891
Accordingly, you will be
executed by firing squad.

470
01:04:56,935 --> 01:04:58,436
Let's go.

471
01:04:59,772 --> 01:05:02,273
Were they taking me back to the prison?

472
01:05:02,357 --> 01:05:04,192
It was a painful journey.

473
01:05:18,165 --> 01:05:20,583
Would I return to the same cell?

474
01:06:09,967 --> 01:06:12,468
I broke into nervous laughter
that relieved me.

475
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:18,724
Then, a bit later, I once again feared
that all my efforts would be for nothing.

476
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:31,154
Dressed half as French soldier,
half as German soldier,

477
01:06:31,238 --> 01:06:33,281
he was disgustingly filthy.

478
01:06:33,365 --> 01:06:35,867
He seemed barely 16.

479
01:06:37,953 --> 01:06:38,703
Are you German?

480
01:06:40,205 --> 01:06:41,873
French?

481
01:06:41,957 --> 01:06:43,749
What's your name?

482
01:06:43,834 --> 01:06:46,669
Jost. Franois Jost.

483
01:06:46,753 --> 01:06:48,087
Was he a stool pigeon?

484
01:06:48,922 --> 01:06:52,258
Did they think I'd talk,
shaken up by my verdict?

485
01:06:55,929 --> 01:06:57,597
Give me your hand, Jost.

486
01:06:59,683 --> 01:07:01,517
There's not much space.

487
01:07:04,605 --> 01:07:07,940
They caught me, brought me back
and convicted me of desertion.

488
01:07:08,025 --> 01:07:09,025
You believe me?

489
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:11,194
Yes.

490
01:07:11,278 --> 01:07:14,155
I believed him, but at the same time
I felt a horrible uneasiness.

491
01:07:15,991 --> 01:07:19,118
It was for France.
Why else would I sign up?

492
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:23,873
France is your khaki pants and leggings.
That's all that's left of it.

493
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:25,625
How could I know?

494
01:07:25,709 --> 01:07:27,501
You should have known.

495
01:07:27,586 --> 01:07:29,962
I hadn't finished my sentence
and they sent me to the rail road.

496
01:07:30,047 --> 01:07:32,715
I stopped the French passengers
from getting on the railway carriages.

497
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:33,799
Which ones?

498
01:07:33,884 --> 01:07:35,885
The ones reserved for their troops.
Carriage guard.

499
01:07:35,969 --> 01:07:38,512
That's how I arrived three days ago.

500
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:48,522
Stand in front of the door.
When it opens, ask for an extra mattress.

501
01:07:54,988 --> 01:07:57,990
His request was granted
and he even received a blanket.

502
01:07:59,743 --> 01:08:01,244
The two of you were drunk?

503
01:08:01,328 --> 01:08:03,829
We did nothing wrong.
We tried out my gun and shot in the air.

504
01:08:03,914 --> 01:08:05,581
It wasn't only in the air.

505
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:07,792
Was the cop French?

506
01:08:07,876 --> 01:08:08,918
Yes.

507
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:10,169
You saw him fall down?

508
01:08:10,254 --> 01:08:13,172
I don't know. We took off running.
Exactly what we shouldn't have done.

509
01:08:13,257 --> 01:08:15,508
Fifteen minutes later,
we were in a cell at St. Paul.

510
01:08:16,301 --> 01:08:18,344
They came looking for me.

511
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:20,596
- Why?
- To change prison.

512
01:08:23,809 --> 01:08:25,601
What about you?

513
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:28,271
It's time to be quiet now.

514
01:08:36,863 --> 01:08:37,863
You can finish it.

515
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:51,711
Go to bed and sleep.

516
01:09:07,644 --> 01:09:11,689
The timing of his arrival with the reading
of my sentence struck me.

517
01:09:11,773 --> 01:09:14,692
There was no time to lose.
I'd have to make a choice.

518
01:09:14,776 --> 01:09:17,236
Either bring Jost with me
or do away with him.

519
01:09:17,321 --> 01:09:20,406
In that case, my heaviest hook
would be an effective weapon.

520
01:09:21,074 --> 01:09:24,076
But would I have the courage
to kill this kid in cold blood?

521
01:09:28,415 --> 01:09:29,915
Wash up.

522
01:09:41,595 --> 01:09:43,846
Get going. Don't wait any longer.

523
01:09:53,607 --> 01:09:55,107
Not alone anymore?

524
01:09:59,613 --> 01:10:01,447
Watch out, Fontaine.

525
01:10:10,791 --> 01:10:13,125
You don't talk?

526
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:14,835
I'm not in the habit.

527
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:17,088
I know why you're here.

528
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:19,340
Say it.

529
01:10:20,342 --> 01:10:22,218
You're here because
you blew up a bridge.

530
01:10:23,178 --> 01:10:24,136
I swear...

531
01:10:24,221 --> 01:10:25,971
I would've loved that job.

532
01:10:26,056 --> 01:10:27,390
That job?

533
01:10:27,474 --> 01:10:30,976
But, Jost, when you blow up a bridge,
they're well guarded,

534
01:10:31,061 --> 01:10:33,145
you sometimes pay with your life.

535
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:35,272
You can't be a chicken or fainthearted.

536
01:10:35,357 --> 01:10:37,483
I'm no chicken or fainthearted.

537
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:39,318
You can't serve two masters.

538
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:41,821
You chose to wear this uniform.

539
01:10:41,905 --> 01:10:43,572
I didn't choose a thing.

540
01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:46,909
Does my jacket bother you?

541
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:50,329
No point.
That won't change a thing.

542
01:10:50,414 --> 01:10:52,748
You are what you are.

543
01:10:52,833 --> 01:10:54,750
What am I?

544
01:10:54,835 --> 01:10:57,128
Stay in your filth.
Hang onto your lice.

545
01:10:58,255 --> 01:10:59,505
I bet you're covered in them.

546
01:11:00,507 --> 01:11:01,715
Maybe a few.

547
01:11:03,051 --> 01:11:04,760
Really?

548
01:11:18,692 --> 01:11:20,401
You just had to come here.

549
01:11:21,570 --> 01:11:23,279
They're all gone.

550
01:11:45,552 --> 01:11:47,803
What's the matter?

551
01:11:55,395 --> 01:11:57,104
Nothing.

552
01:11:58,023 --> 01:12:00,232
You think they'll hold me
for a long time?

553
01:12:00,317 --> 01:12:01,942
You're asking me?

554
01:12:02,027 --> 01:12:03,068
A very long time.

555
01:12:03,153 --> 01:12:04,778
Weeks, months,

556
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:06,489
a year, two years maybe.

557
01:12:06,573 --> 01:12:08,741
Locked up in here?

558
01:12:08,825 --> 01:12:10,451
Or only a few days.

559
01:12:10,535 --> 01:12:12,870
That depends on
how useful you are to them.

560
01:12:12,954 --> 01:12:14,330
Useful?

561
01:12:15,457 --> 01:12:17,416
Watch out, Jost.

562
01:12:17,501 --> 01:12:19,418
The war will end someday
and they'll lose it.

563
01:12:19,503 --> 01:12:23,464
- They won't lose the war.
- They will, and they'll leave.

564
01:12:24,633 --> 01:12:27,760
They aren't much protection.
They'll leave you behind in your country,

565
01:12:27,844 --> 01:12:30,429
with nobody to defend you.

566
01:12:30,514 --> 01:12:31,972
And there will be no pity.

567
01:12:32,057 --> 01:12:33,557
What should I fear at my age?

568
01:12:33,642 --> 01:12:35,684
No pity for your age.

569
01:12:36,645 --> 01:12:38,103
Think it over.

570
01:12:38,188 --> 01:12:40,064
Think what over?

571
01:12:40,148 --> 01:12:41,607
It's too late anyway.

572
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:43,734
Too late?

573
01:12:43,818 --> 01:12:47,404
- Do you believe in luck?
- I used to. It didn't work out.

574
01:12:48,073 --> 01:12:50,241
Maybe you're the one who blew it.

575
01:12:50,325 --> 01:12:51,825
Why did you leave home?

576
01:12:52,494 --> 01:12:54,495
Why not? Something to do.

577
01:12:56,164 --> 01:12:57,456
What did your father say?

578
01:12:58,083 --> 01:12:59,583
He didn't give a damn.

579
01:13:00,252 --> 01:13:03,003
- And your mother?
- She followed me to the station.

580
01:13:03,505 --> 01:13:06,340
I shook her off
and managed to take the train.

581
01:13:07,342 --> 01:13:08,801
She must really have loved you.

582
01:13:08,885 --> 01:13:11,804
More than my brothers,
even more than my sister.

583
01:13:11,888 --> 01:13:15,391
- You've got a sister?
- She was little, but pretty, beautiful.

584
01:13:15,475 --> 01:13:17,184
My mother was pretty too.

585
01:13:17,936 --> 01:13:19,436
Don't you want to see them again?

586
01:13:20,105 --> 01:13:22,773
Yes, but I don't see how.

587
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:39,999
What are you writing?

588
01:13:49,092 --> 01:13:50,593
Come see.

589
01:14:04,816 --> 01:14:07,985
It's our pencil.
It's yours too if you need it.

590
01:14:08,653 --> 01:14:09,695
Why hide it?

591
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:12,865
It's forbidden.
If they find it, they shoot us.

592
01:14:12,949 --> 01:14:14,992
Shot for a pencil?

593
01:14:32,802 --> 01:14:36,138
The evening meal was served
without me telling Jost any more.

594
01:15:02,248 --> 01:15:04,041
The night was dark.

595
01:15:04,125 --> 01:15:06,585
The following night
would be darker still.

596
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:08,671
It had to be tomorrow.

597
01:15:12,175 --> 01:15:14,426
But would I have to kill him?

598
01:15:19,641 --> 01:15:21,308
Wake up, Jost.

599
01:15:48,753 --> 01:15:51,547
My last wishes if I fail.
If you would please...

600
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:55,718
I promise.

601
01:16:16,197 --> 01:16:17,156
My God.

602
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:20,576
I wrote down all I've done
and what I still have to do to escape.

603
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:22,953
I'd like it to be known.

604
01:16:23,913 --> 01:16:26,081
Pray for me, Father.

605
01:16:26,708 --> 01:16:28,208
You too.

606
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:32,212
Good-bye.

607
01:16:50,690 --> 01:16:53,150
I would never have that chance.

608
01:16:53,234 --> 01:16:54,693
What if you did?

609
01:16:54,778 --> 01:16:57,488
For example,
on the way to interrogation.

610
01:16:57,572 --> 01:16:59,031
What would you do?

611
01:16:59,115 --> 01:17:00,991
I'd make use of it and escape.

612
01:17:01,075 --> 01:17:02,284
You think so?

613
01:17:02,368 --> 01:17:03,035
Yes.

614
01:17:06,873 --> 01:17:08,457
Sometimes it's easier with two.

615
01:17:08,541 --> 01:17:10,417
We help each other out.

616
01:17:11,252 --> 01:17:13,837
It's not only on the way
to interrogation.

617
01:17:15,089 --> 01:17:16,757
What do you mean?

618
01:17:18,051 --> 01:17:20,761
I mean if you agree to help me,

619
01:17:20,845 --> 01:17:21,845
we might be able...

620
01:17:22,680 --> 01:17:24,348
To get out of here?

621
01:17:24,432 --> 01:17:26,058
Are you out of your mind?

622
01:17:32,732 --> 01:17:34,733
Have you seen those walls?

623
01:17:35,735 --> 01:17:37,653
And those bars?

624
01:17:38,321 --> 01:17:40,322
Come on, Fontaine.
Think about it.

625
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:43,659
You gonna laugh?

626
01:17:43,743 --> 01:17:45,244
I don't laugh.

627
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:57,297
I've thought it all through,
calculated everything.

628
01:17:57,382 --> 01:18:00,592
From getting out of the building
to crossing over the walkway.

629
01:18:02,512 --> 01:18:06,139
There are still unforeseen factors.
We might have surprises.

630
01:18:08,268 --> 01:18:10,644
I say "we" because now...

631
01:18:15,316 --> 01:18:17,442
And believe me, Jost,
all the odds are in my favor.

632
01:18:17,527 --> 01:18:19,278
I'm absolutely sure
of the tools I've made,

633
01:18:19,362 --> 01:18:21,738
sure of myself,
sure of my luck and yours.

634
01:18:21,823 --> 01:18:23,490
You won't regret following me.

635
01:18:23,992 --> 01:18:25,617
Once we're out,
I'll take care of you.

636
01:18:25,702 --> 01:18:27,953
I'll help you make the most
of your freedom, I swear.

637
01:18:28,037 --> 01:18:30,372
Quite a job you've done.

638
01:18:31,207 --> 01:18:32,207
It's tempting.

639
01:18:32,292 --> 01:18:33,792
Tempting?

640
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:39,131
Jost, it's not up to you now.
You must understand.

641
01:18:40,300 --> 01:18:42,426
I'm free to say yes or no.

642
01:18:42,510 --> 01:18:44,303
Now you know everything.

643
01:18:44,387 --> 01:18:46,054
I know everything?

644
01:18:46,139 --> 01:18:47,264
Enough.

645
01:18:47,348 --> 01:18:50,475
I warn you not to shout,
not to sound the alarm.

646
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:53,478
If you report me,
or if we're caught because of you...

647
01:18:53,563 --> 01:18:55,647
Who do you take me for, Fontaine?

648
01:18:55,732 --> 01:18:57,232
Is that yes?

649
01:18:59,319 --> 01:19:00,652
Yes.

650
01:19:32,685 --> 01:19:34,436
I emptied my mattress into Jost's

651
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:36,772
and cut the cloth
following the markings.

652
01:20:03,466 --> 01:20:05,592
In less than two hours,
the rope was ready and tested,

653
01:20:05,677 --> 01:20:07,719
the cell was organized and swept.

654
01:20:25,571 --> 01:20:27,489
You'll tap?

655
01:20:27,573 --> 01:20:29,074
I will.

656
01:20:30,535 --> 01:20:32,202
Good-bye, my friend.

657
01:20:44,966 --> 01:20:46,466
First heel,

658
01:20:47,301 --> 01:20:49,302
then toe.

659
01:20:51,097 --> 01:20:52,764
We had made four bundles.

660
01:20:52,849 --> 01:20:54,933
One with our shoes tied together,

661
01:20:55,018 --> 01:20:56,476
another with our jackets,

662
01:20:56,561 --> 01:20:59,396
a third with the big rope
and its hooks

663
01:20:59,480 --> 01:21:02,524
and the fourth with the softer rope
for the walkway.

664
01:23:17,493 --> 01:23:20,662
The gravel crunched under our feet.
We had to stop.

665
01:24:36,656 --> 01:24:38,156
It took us more than 20 minutes

666
01:24:38,241 --> 01:24:40,909
to reach the end of the terrace
over the small courtyard.

667
01:24:58,177 --> 01:25:02,013
What was that creaking
we heard at regular intervals?

668
01:25:02,098 --> 01:25:04,766
I couldn't imagine what it was.

669
01:25:35,381 --> 01:25:37,757
He was armed with a tommy gun.

670
01:25:37,842 --> 01:25:39,843
I could make out the grenades
hanging from his belt

671
01:25:39,927 --> 01:25:42,637
and the bayonet
sticking out of its sheath.

672
01:26:04,827 --> 01:26:06,661
The bells struck midnight.

673
01:26:13,169 --> 01:26:15,420
Then 1:00 a.m.

674
01:26:46,535 --> 01:26:48,370
Their movements were identical.

675
01:26:48,454 --> 01:26:50,121
They went back and forth along the walls

676
01:26:50,206 --> 01:26:53,208
rarely reaching the corner,
never passing it.

677
01:27:00,674 --> 01:27:02,133
By descending on the other side,

678
01:27:02,218 --> 01:27:06,429
I could hide in the corner
and wait for the right moment.

679
01:27:07,098 --> 01:27:09,474
This man had to disappear.

680
01:28:28,262 --> 01:28:29,429
Your turn. Go down.

681
01:29:57,935 --> 01:30:01,604
I let go of the iron hook.
It didn't seem a sure weapon.

682
01:30:05,484 --> 01:30:08,152
I had to act but couldn't.

683
01:30:08,237 --> 01:30:10,905
With both hands I restrained
the beating of my heart.

684
01:30:24,587 --> 01:30:26,254
Was he sitting down?

685
01:30:26,338 --> 01:30:28,339
Was he lighting a cigarette?

686
01:30:41,020 --> 01:30:42,854
He wasn't coming any closer to me.

687
01:31:08,714 --> 01:31:11,549
He was right there, very close,
about a meter away from me.

688
01:31:11,634 --> 01:31:13,343
He made a half-turn.

689
01:32:18,117 --> 01:32:20,118
He'd forgotten our jackets
and shoes on the roof,

690
01:32:20,202 --> 01:32:22,203
but I didn't say a thing.

691
01:33:01,994 --> 01:33:04,245
Alone, I might have remained there.

692
01:34:07,684 --> 01:34:09,519
All I knew about the guard system

693
01:34:09,603 --> 01:34:12,438
is that there was a sentry booth
positioned at each corner.

694
01:34:13,398 --> 01:34:15,817
Was it occupied or not?

695
01:34:17,986 --> 01:34:19,487
It wasn't.

696
01:34:46,932 --> 01:34:48,599
He's alone.

697
01:34:59,695 --> 01:35:01,529
Cut the electrical wire.

698
01:35:01,613 --> 01:35:03,281
How?

699
01:35:43,572 --> 01:35:44,989
Quickly.

700
01:36:42,881 --> 01:36:43,923
The hook.

701
01:36:51,598 --> 01:36:53,349
Jost trembled.
Perhaps I did as well.

702
01:37:08,490 --> 01:37:09,991
I hesitated.

703
01:37:34,599 --> 01:37:36,726
The bells struck 4:00.

704
01:37:47,904 --> 01:37:51,240
Time passed.
Our chances got slimmer.

705
01:39:01,353 --> 01:39:02,853
Jost.

706
01:39:02,938 --> 01:39:04,772
If only my mother could see me.
