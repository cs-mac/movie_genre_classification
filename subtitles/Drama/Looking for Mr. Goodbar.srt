1
00:03:36,606 --> 00:03:40,631
Next June you're supposed to be
graduating college... not high school.

2
00:03:40,731 --> 00:03:45,109
You were supposed to write an essay
about personal conflict.

3
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:47,647
Obviously, most of you never hoped
to write anything more literate...

4
00:03:47,747 --> 00:03:49,442
than a personal cheque.

5
00:03:49,542 --> 00:03:51,673
This paper is an exception.

6
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,773
At least, it's legible.

7
00:03:54,754 --> 00:03:56,754
May I?

8
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:00,497
'The last time I went to confession
I was fifteen.'

9
00:04:00,597 --> 00:04:02,486
'The booth was dark and hot.'

10
00:04:02,586 --> 00:04:05,336
'Of the seven deadly sins
I was guilty of three:'

11
00:04:05,436 --> 00:04:07,664
'Envy and lust for my sister's fault.'

12
00:04:07,764 --> 00:04:11,546
'I envied her beauty and
lusted for her boyfriends.'

13
00:04:11,646 --> 00:04:14,448
'I was afraid to confess and afraid not to.'

14
00:04:14,548 --> 00:04:17,492
'I felt no contrition, not even shame.'

15
00:04:17,592 --> 00:04:19,537
'I still felt the same lust.'

16
00:04:19,637 --> 00:04:21,471
'Was it in my mind...'

17
00:04:21,571 --> 00:04:23,571
'... or my body?'

18
00:04:57,702 --> 00:05:00,002
Miss Dunn. Miss Dunn.

19
00:05:00,456 --> 00:05:01,603
You're alright?

20
00:05:01,703 --> 00:05:03,703
It's my back.

21
00:05:04,544 --> 00:05:08,114
Oh, it's nothing, professor Engle. Really.

22
00:05:09,405 --> 00:05:10,645
For your next assignment...

23
00:05:10,745 --> 00:05:16,015
Describe an irrepressable temptation
and what you did about it.

24
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,410
Yeah?

25
00:05:30,178 --> 00:05:32,178
It's me.

26
00:05:32,338 --> 00:05:33,421
Bullshit.

27
00:05:33,521 --> 00:05:35,836
Why can't you take him
to the Christmas play?

28
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:37,936
He's your son, too.

29
00:05:42,487 --> 00:05:44,612
It's always an emergency.

30
00:05:45,224 --> 00:05:47,514
No. No, no. What you really mean is...

31
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:52,034
a doctor's indispensable,
a teacher is ridiculous.

32
00:05:52,942 --> 00:05:55,060
And you... You want to be a teacher?

33
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,124
- Yes.
- It's ridiculous.

34
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:58,356
I like kids.

35
00:05:58,456 --> 00:06:00,099
Why not? You don't have any.

36
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:02,978
Why do you want to waste your time
correcting the drivel of other students?

37
00:06:03,078 --> 00:06:04,805
It can't be for the wages I pay.

38
00:06:04,905 --> 00:06:07,240
Practically every girl in class wants this job.

39
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,340
Without pay. Just to b... be here.

40
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,990
But I chose you. You know why?

41
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:14,158
Because you're the only girl in class...

42
00:06:14,258 --> 00:06:17,419
who knows syntax and grammar,
and can spell.

43
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:19,814
And that's the only reason.

44
00:06:42,058 --> 00:06:43,759
That bad?

45
00:06:43,859 --> 00:06:46,452
- You should've told me.
- Isn't it obvious?

46
00:06:46,552 --> 00:06:48,711
Nothing about you is obvious.

47
00:06:48,811 --> 00:06:51,534
Till this morning I didn't know
that you were catholic...

48
00:06:51,634 --> 00:06:53,409
or that you had a sister...

49
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:58,406
or that you were a dragon lady
filled with envy and lust.

50
00:06:58,506 --> 00:07:00,606
So... your back.

51
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,399
How'd it happen?

52
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:07,033
Car accident?

53
00:07:08,415 --> 00:07:10,615
Polio, when I was six.

54
00:07:11,802 --> 00:07:14,436
It left me with a limp till I was eleven.

55
00:07:14,536 --> 00:07:17,835
That's when they operated
to straighten my spine.

56
00:07:17,935 --> 00:07:19,935
Scoliosis, they said.

57
00:07:21,788 --> 00:07:23,788
From the polio.

58
00:07:25,966 --> 00:07:27,966
Poppa...

59
00:07:28,552 --> 00:07:30,552
Poppa...

60
00:07:31,658 --> 00:07:33,658
After that...

61
00:07:43,823 --> 00:07:46,798
I came home wearing a plaster cast.

62
00:07:47,548 --> 00:07:50,523
They put me on a bed, downstairs...

63
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,395
in our living-room...

64
00:07:53,495 --> 00:07:55,875
where everyone can watch.

65
00:07:56,092 --> 00:07:58,092
Day and night.

66
00:07:58,294 --> 00:08:01,014
For one whole year and two days.

67
00:08:03,108 --> 00:08:04,777
They prayed a lot.

68
00:08:04,877 --> 00:08:07,342
It was God's will, they said.

69
00:08:09,787 --> 00:08:12,566
I never did understand what
terrible thing I did, you know...

70
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,706
to make God so angry?

71
00:08:14,776 --> 00:08:16,698
- Poor little baby...
- No.

72
00:08:16,798 --> 00:08:19,518
No... I hate people being sorry.

73
00:08:19,795 --> 00:08:22,077
I was only trying to comfort you.

74
00:08:22,177 --> 00:08:25,322
I'd rather be seduced than comforted.

75
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:30,572
A perfect opening to your essay
on temptation.

76
00:08:30,672 --> 00:08:32,797
'How I Lost My Virginity'

77
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,963
Despite the sexual revolution...

78
00:08:46,063 --> 00:08:49,362
not all married men are swingers.

79
00:08:51,987 --> 00:08:53,987
Sex...

80
00:08:54,163 --> 00:08:56,968
between teacher and student...

81
00:08:58,102 --> 00:09:00,102
is improper...

82
00:09:01,595 --> 00:09:03,595
immoral...

83
00:09:04,523 --> 00:09:06,523
illegal...

84
00:09:06,855 --> 00:09:09,320
and unbelievably tempting.

85
00:09:11,982 --> 00:09:14,382
So easy to yield...

86
00:09:32,561 --> 00:09:34,944
- How many lovers have you...
- Does it matter?

87
00:09:35,044 --> 00:09:36,640
Right.

88
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,474
Confession might be good for the soul...

89
00:09:39,574 --> 00:09:40,982
but it's bad for sex.

90
00:09:41,082 --> 00:09:43,382
Oh, my God... Oh, my...

91
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,330
Oh... dear God...

92
00:10:03,425 --> 00:10:05,425
Don't.

93
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:07,505
Don't... It's ugly.

94
00:10:13,754 --> 00:10:16,254
I love you... oh, I love you.

95
00:10:20,622 --> 00:10:23,256
I'm not sure that aspirin
is the remedy for your problem.

96
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:25,357
God, no...

97
00:10:55,687 --> 00:10:58,287
- Did I hurt you?
- No. no.

98
00:11:40,363 --> 00:11:42,363
Well-why did you stop?

99
00:11:42,517 --> 00:11:44,517
Did you...?

100
00:11:46,036 --> 00:11:48,036
Is it over?

101
00:11:48,544 --> 00:11:50,924
I'll be late for class.

102
00:11:51,094 --> 00:11:52,486
It was... just...

103
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,457
so nice...

104
00:11:54,557 --> 00:11:56,557
Next time fireworks.

105
00:11:56,885 --> 00:12:00,123
This time it was a little premature.

106
00:12:00,223 --> 00:12:02,076
Was it me?

107
00:12:02,176 --> 00:12:04,041
Was it my fault? Did I...

108
00:12:04,141 --> 00:12:05,876
do something wrong? Or something...

109
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:07,976
It's just...

110
00:12:08,214 --> 00:12:10,849
I never had a virgin before.

111
00:12:11,552 --> 00:12:13,847
You are now a fallen woman.

112
00:12:15,566 --> 00:12:17,566
Thank God.

113
00:12:19,215 --> 00:12:20,371
Hi, Tom.

114
00:12:20,471 --> 00:12:21,840
Hi. Katherine's come home.

115
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,065
More beautiful than ever.

116
00:12:25,576 --> 00:12:27,993
- Why can't she be home for Christmas?
- Oh, you stop that.

117
00:12:28,093 --> 00:12:29,656
- A family should be together.
- She'll be in Puerto Rico...

118
00:12:29,756 --> 00:12:31,429
- Your sister's home.
- On business.

119
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:33,565
- What kind of business?
- Stewardess business.

120
00:12:33,665 --> 00:12:35,601
- What the hell else?
- She flies Chicago-NY-Chicago...

121
00:12:35,701 --> 00:12:36,923
What's in Puerto Rico?

122
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:39,878
Look... For God sake's.
Would somebody answer that telephone?

123
00:12:39,978 --> 00:12:41,567
Katherine told you and I told you...

124
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:43,416
it's a charter flight.

125
00:12:43,516 --> 00:12:45,791
- Wha... What the hell happened?
- Hello?

126
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:47,524
Are you deaf?

127
00:12:47,624 --> 00:12:48,692
That's the FBI.

128
00:12:48,792 --> 00:12:52,051
Cleaning up the scum of the earth.
Get them surrounded most of the time...

129
00:12:52,151 --> 00:12:53,723
Brigid.

130
00:12:53,823 --> 00:12:55,061
What's keeping your sister?

131
00:12:55,161 --> 00:12:58,026
In a minute, Poppa.
You oughtta see her underware.

132
00:12:58,126 --> 00:13:00,126
Katherine. Phone.

133
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:01,955
Did you see the presents she brought?

134
00:13:02,055 --> 00:13:04,435
Yeah... generous poor thing.

135
00:13:04,809 --> 00:13:06,899
How can you drink before driving?

136
00:13:06,999 --> 00:13:08,500
Like this.

137
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,281
- Can you baby-sit tonight?
- I got a class tonight.

138
00:13:11,381 --> 00:13:13,673
- Who is it?
- It's Dennis O'Brian.

139
00:13:13,773 --> 00:13:15,222
Not now.

140
00:13:15,322 --> 00:13:17,069
I said hang up.

141
00:13:17,169 --> 00:13:18,360
Dennis the menace...

142
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,516
- He's her husband.
- Was, woman, was.

143
00:13:20,616 --> 00:13:23,081
- No divorce for us.
- Annulled.

144
00:13:28,834 --> 00:13:30,551
Do you have any Valium? Cody?

145
00:13:30,651 --> 00:13:32,199
Aspirin?

146
00:13:32,299 --> 00:13:38,164
Oh. If I don't take something soon
I'm gonna soon jump out of my skin.

147
00:13:38,825 --> 00:13:41,545
Why did you and Dennis break up?

148
00:13:42,743 --> 00:13:47,425
Dennis? Oh, there was nothing
he wouldn't do for me. Nothing.

149
00:13:47,525 --> 00:13:49,121
But he drove me crazy, I mean...

150
00:13:49,221 --> 00:13:52,215
I just wanted to scream
all the time, he was...

151
00:13:52,315 --> 00:13:54,515
so dull and... boring.

152
00:13:55,163 --> 00:13:57,628
His eyes were always begging.

153
00:13:58,695 --> 00:14:01,330
It can't get annulled for that.

154
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:04,233
So...

155
00:14:04,999 --> 00:14:06,999
So you lie and...

156
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:12,115
I'm a mess.

157
00:14:12,162 --> 00:14:14,915
Whatever I do,
nothing turns out right.

158
00:14:15,015 --> 00:14:17,900
Oh, except you, Katherine...
Oh, you... you're perfect.

159
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,402
You've perfect hair, perfect teeth,
perfect legs...

160
00:14:21,502 --> 00:14:24,441
You name it, you got it.
You got everything.

161
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:27,586
Look, you 747 in here, packed
in gifts like Santa Claus and...

162
00:14:27,686 --> 00:14:29,726
Maybe... I'm in trouble.

163
00:14:30,364 --> 00:14:32,764
I'm in real... trouble.

164
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,625
For the past six, seven months...

165
00:14:36,746 --> 00:14:39,551
I've been living with a man...

166
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,089
well, actually two men.

167
00:14:42,752 --> 00:14:45,727
One in Chicago and one in New York.

168
00:14:47,421 --> 00:14:50,583
The real problem is...
that I'm pregnant.

169
00:14:50,683 --> 00:14:51,951
Oh, Kathy...

170
00:14:52,051 --> 00:14:54,736
I don't even know if it was
Chicago or New York.

171
00:14:54,836 --> 00:14:57,301
You'll be late for the plane.

172
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:04,635
Anyway, I'm getting rid of it in Puerto Rico.

173
00:15:04,926 --> 00:15:07,391
There's a place the girls go.

174
00:15:08,194 --> 00:15:10,283
I told Pa I had to work a charter.

175
00:15:10,383 --> 00:15:15,226
- If he ever found out, he'd kill me.
- He'd never believe it.

176
00:15:15,326 --> 00:15:18,471
Oh, I'm sorry to lay all this on you.

177
00:15:22,483 --> 00:15:26,138
You're my Rock of Gibraltar,
you really are.

178
00:15:26,214 --> 00:15:31,550
Ever since the polio. The whole family
gave up, even Father Timothy...

179
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,650
But you...

180
00:15:33,913 --> 00:15:36,633
you never even cry. Not once.

181
00:15:37,742 --> 00:15:39,742
You're the rock, baby.

182
00:15:40,544 --> 00:15:45,044
Ma, Pa, Brigid... they all think
I pee perfume.

183
00:15:48,797 --> 00:15:51,942
Well, you know, I'm a little fleak...

184
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,537
and you never blame me.

185
00:15:58,046 --> 00:16:01,446
We all need somebody who won't blame us.

186
00:16:06,614 --> 00:16:08,614
Do I look... okay?

187
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,567
Perfect.

188
00:16:16,262 --> 00:16:18,520
When teaching a deaf child,
you must always remember...

189
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:22,615
not to have the light shining in their face.

190
00:16:22,888 --> 00:16:25,604
Always remember to speak to the
children in a normal tone of voice...

191
00:16:25,704 --> 00:16:27,223
and face them.

192
00:16:27,323 --> 00:16:31,992
Never allow yourself to become impatient
or angry with the children.

193
00:16:32,092 --> 00:16:34,727
How do you get their attention?

194
00:16:35,323 --> 00:16:38,614
By tapping on the table, and
if you are at a distance...

195
00:16:38,714 --> 00:16:40,924
by blinking the lights.

196
00:17:22,137 --> 00:17:24,602
Superb. Perfection. Poetry in motion.

197
00:17:24,702 --> 00:17:26,702
But... do you love me?

198
00:17:59,655 --> 00:18:01,655
Don't do that.

199
00:18:01,964 --> 00:18:04,927
People who tiptoe and not being
considerate are begging for attention.

200
00:18:05,027 --> 00:18:07,027
Damn.

201
00:18:07,734 --> 00:18:10,624
There's some last minute shopping.

202
00:18:11,648 --> 00:18:13,748
Merry Christmas.

203
00:18:14,448 --> 00:18:16,448
It's a... a pipe.

204
00:18:17,037 --> 00:18:19,769
Christmas? It's commercialized crap.

205
00:18:19,869 --> 00:18:24,071
If you want to celebrate the birth
of Jesus, do it at church.

206
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:26,466
See you after the holidays.

207
00:18:28,598 --> 00:18:30,598
Ciao.

208
00:18:32,638 --> 00:18:35,738
1975 has just become history.

209
00:18:36,997 --> 00:18:41,771
It was only five years ago that
10000 women marched for liberation.

210
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:43,262
They carried books, science...

211
00:18:43,362 --> 00:18:45,081
and babies.

212
00:18:45,181 --> 00:18:46,556
They called for free abortion...

213
00:18:46,656 --> 00:18:50,074
equal education, equal job and
pay opportunities.

214
00:18:50,174 --> 00:18:52,174
And... sexual freedom.

215
00:18:52,729 --> 00:18:56,329
This was to be 'The decade of the Dames'

216
00:19:05,224 --> 00:19:06,823
Hello?

217
00:19:06,923 --> 00:19:08,589
Hello?

218
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,689
Katherine?

219
00:19:11,858 --> 00:19:15,591
Nobody's home. They all went
to the Knight of Columbus Party.

220
00:19:15,691 --> 00:19:17,691
Where are you?

221
00:19:19,806 --> 00:19:21,453
Honeymoon?

222
00:19:21,553 --> 00:19:23,553
You're married?

223
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:26,750
I thought you went for an abortion.

224
00:19:29,364 --> 00:19:32,364
Yeah... I'm sure he's terrific but
if you just met him on the plane...

225
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:35,064
two days ago?

226
00:19:36,922 --> 00:19:39,890
Of course, I'm happy.
If you're happy, I'm happy.

227
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,990
Is he nice?

228
00:19:42,129 --> 00:19:44,339
Is he also catholic?

229
00:19:46,282 --> 00:19:50,957
Then you'd better break the news
to Poppa yourself?

230
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:56,824
Happy New Year to you, too.
Both of you.

231
00:19:57,006 --> 00:19:59,006
Hey. What's his name?

232
00:19:59,329 --> 00:20:01,329
Hello? Katherine...?

233
00:20:05,944 --> 00:20:07,944
Happy New Year.

234
00:20:34,173 --> 00:20:37,272
You wanna be my fella? Do you?

235
00:20:58,887 --> 00:20:59,627
- Hello?
- Martin?

236
00:20:59,727 --> 00:21:00,447
- Yeah.
- Happy New...

237
00:21:00,547 --> 00:21:02,577
Hello? Hello?

238
00:21:03,158 --> 00:21:04,887
How could you make such a call?

239
00:21:04,987 --> 00:21:07,034
What, were you drunk? Goofed up?

240
00:21:07,134 --> 00:21:09,511
What the hell were you thinking of?

241
00:21:09,611 --> 00:21:12,403
Nothing. Nothing... nothing
ever happened between us.

242
00:21:12,503 --> 00:21:13,510
And if it does again...

243
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,612
it still never happened.
Do you understand?

244
00:21:15,712 --> 00:21:17,502
I will not be compromised.

245
00:21:17,602 --> 00:21:19,332
Not here on campus, not at my home...

246
00:21:19,432 --> 00:21:21,432
not at work.

247
00:21:21,577 --> 00:21:23,702
I will not leave my wife.

248
00:21:27,872 --> 00:21:30,762
I will not allow her to be hurt...

249
00:21:31,071 --> 00:21:34,471
by an occasional afternoon roll...

250
00:21:35,983 --> 00:21:38,533
It might be better for...

251
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:41,819
both of us, all around, if...

252
00:21:42,223 --> 00:21:44,773
if we forgot we ever...

253
00:21:45,001 --> 00:21:47,001
if we never again...

254
00:21:50,191 --> 00:21:52,191
Christ.

255
00:21:54,645 --> 00:21:57,245
Oh, yes... yes... yes.

256
00:22:07,495 --> 00:22:09,955
They're here.
Patrick, put on your coat.

257
00:22:10,055 --> 00:22:13,030
They're here. Katherine and... him.

258
00:22:13,324 --> 00:22:15,939
- He don't look Jewish...
- You can always tell by the nose.

259
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:17,910
What's he driving?

260
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:20,010
Mercedes Benz.

261
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:21,852
Jewish.

262
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:23,977
- Wait till you see her fur coat.
- They're out of church wedding...

263
00:22:24,077 --> 00:22:26,014
- Mink. Down to here.
- They're living in sin.

264
00:22:26,114 --> 00:22:28,239
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

265
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,170
Oh. Poppa. I love you.
Be nice to him?

266
00:22:35,932 --> 00:22:37,932
Get the phone.

267
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:45,654
Hello? Who is it?

268
00:22:57,482 --> 00:22:59,351
Happy Easter.

269
00:22:59,451 --> 00:23:00,765
Happy Pass Over.

270
00:23:00,865 --> 00:23:02,905
- You must be...
- Theresa.

271
00:23:05,163 --> 00:23:07,163
Must be married...

272
00:23:07,658 --> 00:23:10,563
Honey, when a guy won't give his name...

273
00:23:10,663 --> 00:23:12,663
Mrs. Dunn.

274
00:23:17,615 --> 00:23:18,859
Hi, Ma.

275
00:23:18,959 --> 00:23:20,665
Mr. Dunn.

276
00:23:20,765 --> 00:23:23,315
Just don't ever call me 'Dad'.

277
00:23:26,766 --> 00:23:28,766
Where?

278
00:23:29,868 --> 00:23:31,868
When?

279
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:49,761
Baby. Baby.

280
00:23:49,925 --> 00:23:51,925
How'd you get away?

281
00:24:24,542 --> 00:24:27,971
I wonder... why is it after we make love...

282
00:24:28,071 --> 00:24:30,137
we never talk... or touch...

283
00:24:30,237 --> 00:24:32,237
or, anything?

284
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:35,199
Now you're angry.

285
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:37,849
- I am not angry.
- Disappointed?

286
00:24:38,649 --> 00:24:40,649
I'm not disappointed.

287
00:24:43,054 --> 00:24:48,494
I just can't stand a woman's company
right after I've fucked her.

288
00:25:50,773 --> 00:25:52,773
Good Morning.

289
00:25:54,977 --> 00:25:56,977
You alright?

290
00:25:57,762 --> 00:25:59,802
Nothing wrong at school?

291
00:26:00,189 --> 00:26:01,843
Guess what?

292
00:26:01,943 --> 00:26:05,428
I'm pregnant again.
Number two on the way.

293
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:09,305
My mother had four.
All boys, all perfect.

294
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,844
Five, Poppa...

295
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,786
You always forget Aunt Maureen.

296
00:26:12,886 --> 00:26:15,889
- God rest her soul and forgive her.
- Forgive what?

297
00:26:15,989 --> 00:26:17,989
What'd she do? Poppa?

298
00:26:18,016 --> 00:26:20,755
How the hell you expect me
to eat runny eggs?

299
00:26:20,855 --> 00:26:24,425
I can't even stand the look at runny eggs.

300
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,348
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

301
00:26:44,341 --> 00:26:46,341
Thank you.

302
00:26:47,326 --> 00:26:49,241
Theresa, will you interpret today?

303
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:51,341
Oh, okay.

304
00:26:54,693 --> 00:26:55,962
So, it's good-bye.

305
00:26:56,062 --> 00:26:59,207
At least, until summer school begins.

306
00:26:59,423 --> 00:27:01,760
I envy your first teaching experience.

307
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:05,380
If those children are going to learn to read...

308
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,945
to write, to understand...

309
00:27:08,613 --> 00:27:10,738
maybe even to speak...

310
00:27:11,564 --> 00:27:14,199
you're their only real hope.

311
00:27:14,963 --> 00:27:17,683
If you can teach a deaf child...

312
00:27:18,047 --> 00:27:20,087
you have touched God.

313
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:24,441
To Joe and Sylvia,
married this afternoon.

314
00:27:24,541 --> 00:27:25,541
Congratulations.

315
00:27:25,641 --> 00:27:27,727
Where are you going on your honeymoon?

316
00:27:27,827 --> 00:27:31,057
- Las vegas.
- Don't lose too much money.

317
00:27:33,374 --> 00:27:36,434
Yes, dear. It'll all fit in the car.

318
00:27:37,229 --> 00:27:40,286
I hate summer vacations,
I hate fishing, I hate the beach.

319
00:27:40,386 --> 00:27:43,411
Reference books
dictionnary, notes...

320
00:27:43,511 --> 00:27:46,571
carbon paper. Cheque. Cheque.

321
00:27:46,684 --> 00:27:51,359
Your last cheque, paid in full,
except for my gratitude.

322
00:27:55,879 --> 00:27:57,879
When do I see you?

323
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,970
Ever?

324
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:05,250
Never.

325
00:28:07,231 --> 00:28:09,025
Who's taking my place?

326
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:13,044
No one can take your place.
You're the most dedicated...

327
00:28:13,144 --> 00:28:15,144
most efficient...

328
00:28:15,157 --> 00:28:17,762
Just the same, you'll find someone else.

329
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,545
There's always...

330
00:28:19,645 --> 00:28:21,645
someone else.

331
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:26,291
Who?

332
00:28:26,983 --> 00:28:28,983
Rhoda...?

333
00:28:29,348 --> 00:28:31,032
Now that you fucked her...

334
00:28:31,132 --> 00:28:33,015
you probably can't stand her either.

335
00:28:33,115 --> 00:28:36,617
It's not very sporting from a mistress
of a married man to be jealous.

336
00:28:36,717 --> 00:28:38,717
I can't help it.

337
00:28:40,922 --> 00:28:43,158
And who ever said that love is a sport?

338
00:28:43,258 --> 00:28:45,558
Yes... Love.

339
00:28:50,271 --> 00:28:52,278
What happened? What did I do?

340
00:28:52,378 --> 00:28:54,458
- Nothing.
- Is my breath bad?

341
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:56,356
- Do I use the wrong toothpaste?
- Stop it.

342
00:28:56,456 --> 00:28:58,592
Is my sex too straight?
Tell me what you want.

343
00:28:58,692 --> 00:29:00,692
Nothing.

344
00:29:01,707 --> 00:29:03,147
It's over, that's all.

345
00:29:03,247 --> 00:29:05,884
We had a long, fine thing together.

346
00:29:05,984 --> 00:29:09,214
Now it's time we moved on. Both of us.

347
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:55,186
- Blood pressure dropping.
- Anybody notified the family?

348
00:29:55,286 --> 00:29:56,683
- On the way.
- It's her spine.

349
00:29:56,783 --> 00:29:57,886
- Immediate surgery.
- Without X-rays?

350
00:29:57,986 --> 00:29:58,943
No time.

351
00:29:59,043 --> 00:30:00,259
- Don't touch her.
- I love her...

352
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:02,882
- Show him out. He's contaminating.
- It's my fault, all my fault.

353
00:30:02,982 --> 00:30:04,047
Poor thing...

354
00:30:04,147 --> 00:30:05,716
- I told you.
- It was God's will.

355
00:30:05,816 --> 00:30:08,159
Is she covered by insurance,
Blue Cross or hard cash?

356
00:30:08,259 --> 00:30:09,757
I want a catholic doctor.

357
00:30:09,857 --> 00:30:12,332
Congratulations, your daughter
has a beautiful body.

358
00:30:12,432 --> 00:30:13,670
Runs in the family.

359
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,750
My mother had four. All boys.
All perfect.

360
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:18,721
Perfect.

361
00:30:18,821 --> 00:30:20,454
- Is she in pain?
- Not yet.

362
00:30:20,554 --> 00:30:23,115
- She's only two months pregnant.
- No.

363
00:30:23,215 --> 00:30:25,215
Yes... Love.

364
00:30:48,071 --> 00:30:49,891
Hey, baby.

365
00:30:49,991 --> 00:30:52,116
Still in the first grade?

366
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:54,352
I graduate this day.

367
00:31:17,445 --> 00:31:19,122
- Who is it?
- Katherine?

368
00:31:19,222 --> 00:31:21,262
Oh, hi, hon. Come on up.

369
00:31:22,999 --> 00:31:25,974
- Police?
- No, it's my 'sick-easter'.

370
00:31:26,187 --> 00:31:29,162
Hey, hey... That's expensive grass.

371
00:31:32,581 --> 00:31:35,641
Gang, I want you to meet real class.

372
00:31:36,239 --> 00:31:38,702
Theresa, a teacher for deaf kids.

373
00:31:38,802 --> 00:31:40,410
How do you like the place?

374
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:42,276
It's beautiful. You're all beautiful.

375
00:31:42,376 --> 00:31:43,845
- A drag of the best?
- Oh... no...

376
00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:46,395
Katy said she couldn't live
any place else but here...

377
00:31:46,495 --> 00:31:49,820
Well, I can't live without her.
But the place wasn't for rent.

378
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,904
So, we bought the whole damned building.

379
00:31:53,004 --> 00:31:55,424
So, if you ever need an
unfurnished department...

380
00:31:55,524 --> 00:31:56,941
or a brilliant lawyer...

381
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:58,337
Yeah... I'll rob a bank.

382
00:31:58,437 --> 00:32:01,824
No, no, no... For schoolteachers
named Terry, half price.

383
00:32:01,924 --> 00:32:03,766
Oh, I like that, hon.

384
00:32:03,866 --> 00:32:05,483
'Saint Theresa' by day and...

385
00:32:05,583 --> 00:32:07,793
'Swing Terry' by night.

386
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:12,349
To Terry... hmm... by night.

387
00:32:12,923 --> 00:32:14,923
Like old movies?

388
00:32:14,991 --> 00:32:16,211
Yes, I love them.

389
00:32:16,311 --> 00:32:18,776
Let's watch the kiddies play.

390
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,420
Katherine?

391
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:29,912
Well, so you're alive, are you?
All in one piece, are you?

392
00:34:30,012 --> 00:34:32,244
Where the hell have you been
all night? Well?

393
00:34:32,344 --> 00:34:34,469
- Katherine's place.
- Liar.

394
00:34:34,626 --> 00:34:38,007
She's away for the summer.
Do you want me to call her?

395
00:34:38,107 --> 00:34:40,107
Do you?

396
00:34:40,601 --> 00:34:44,530
Liar. I called Brigid. I called the
police. I called the hospitals.

397
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:48,041
You're so damned busy whoring around
you can't spare one minute to call?

398
00:34:48,141 --> 00:34:50,767
- I should have. But I couldn't.
- Yeah. But you didn't.

399
00:34:50,867 --> 00:34:52,867
I couldn't.

400
00:34:53,067 --> 00:34:55,708
He was afraid something happened.

401
00:34:55,808 --> 00:34:59,038
Not knowing what to do, where to go...

402
00:34:59,548 --> 00:35:01,548
You're alright?

403
00:35:02,446 --> 00:35:04,433
- I'll fix breakfast.
- Ma...

404
00:35:04,533 --> 00:35:08,358
I'm sorry for all the trouble.
I didn't think.

405
00:35:08,465 --> 00:35:09,747
Well, you think of this, then:

406
00:35:09,847 --> 00:35:12,447
As long as you live in this house,
you'll live by the rules of this house.

407
00:35:12,547 --> 00:35:14,016
You understand?

408
00:35:14,116 --> 00:35:16,816
- Do you understand?
- Yes, Poppa.

409
00:35:17,701 --> 00:35:20,081
Go on, go. Go fix breakfast.

410
00:35:22,548 --> 00:35:25,613
All right now, before I'm accused of
being a tyrant, or...

411
00:35:25,713 --> 00:35:28,646
by the way, I'm not breaking
any of the rules of the woman's...

412
00:35:28,746 --> 00:35:30,953
- Holy crusade to burn the brassieres?
- No, Poppa.

413
00:35:31,053 --> 00:35:31,859
Fine, allright.

414
00:35:31,959 --> 00:35:34,289
Because I walked to school.

415
00:35:34,689 --> 00:35:37,515
I worked in a coal yard
every day after school.

416
00:35:37,615 --> 00:35:39,615
And all day Saturday.

417
00:35:40,278 --> 00:35:42,318
Twelve dollars a week...

418
00:35:42,676 --> 00:35:45,022
out of which I kept two cents a day
to put in the poor bags, on Sunday.

419
00:35:45,122 --> 00:35:46,635
- The rest of the money...
- You gave your mother.

420
00:35:46,735 --> 00:35:49,775
That's right. Which is more
than I ever asked you to do.

421
00:35:49,875 --> 00:35:52,340
But you, it's been food free.

422
00:35:52,563 --> 00:35:54,603
Thread and clothes free.

423
00:35:54,781 --> 00:35:57,246
Medicine free. TV. Telephone.

424
00:35:57,707 --> 00:36:00,813
What the hell is this supposed to mean?

425
00:36:00,913 --> 00:36:02,546
You're right.

426
00:36:02,646 --> 00:36:04,594
I can't live here by your rules...

427
00:36:04,694 --> 00:36:06,912
And I can't... so it's time I went.

428
00:36:07,012 --> 00:36:09,450
Went? Went where? With who? On what?

429
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:12,045
Alone. My place. My money. My rules.

430
00:36:12,145 --> 00:36:13,977
Aww... alone in magger's paradise.

431
00:36:14,077 --> 00:36:17,004
Well, that's great. Now, we can worry
about you day and night.

432
00:36:17,104 --> 00:36:19,169
Make sense girl. Be yourself.

433
00:36:19,269 --> 00:36:21,274
I can't stay here and be myself.

434
00:36:21,374 --> 00:36:23,012
Your own mucky self, is it?

435
00:36:23,112 --> 00:36:25,506
If it wasn't yourself, what the hell
have you been around here?

436
00:36:25,606 --> 00:36:27,470
What you wanted me to be.

437
00:36:27,570 --> 00:36:31,106
You're not Katherine, you know?
Not by a long shot.

438
00:36:31,206 --> 00:36:33,206
Momma...

439
00:36:36,764 --> 00:36:38,764
Bye, Poppa.

440
00:36:40,746 --> 00:36:43,041
You'll never make it alone.

441
00:36:44,414 --> 00:36:46,116
She's here now.

442
00:36:46,216 --> 00:36:49,135
Yeah, yeah... last night, too. We had...

443
00:36:49,235 --> 00:36:51,235
We had sort of a party.

444
00:36:52,029 --> 00:36:55,325
Well, of course she'll pay her own rent.

445
00:36:55,425 --> 00:36:57,890
Pa... would I lie to you?

446
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:02,000
Her teaching job starts next week.

447
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:04,980
Summer school...

448
00:37:05,506 --> 00:37:07,620
Yeah, of course,
I'll keep an eye on her.

449
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,270
Yeah, I love you too. Bye-bye.

450
00:37:11,776 --> 00:37:13,776
First month's rent.

451
00:37:15,173 --> 00:37:17,893
What you need, first and most...

452
00:37:19,067 --> 00:37:20,604
is a bed.

453
00:37:20,704 --> 00:37:23,424
A bed big enough for everything.

454
00:37:44,582 --> 00:37:45,891
Now...

455
00:37:45,991 --> 00:37:48,626
some signs look alike but...

456
00:37:48,893 --> 00:37:50,894
enjoy... hands open.

457
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:53,739
Enjoy.

458
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,839
Sorry...

459
00:37:59,481 --> 00:38:01,481
Hungry...

460
00:38:06,047 --> 00:38:08,047
Wish...

461
00:38:20,566 --> 00:38:22,766
Class dismissed.

462
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:25,865
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

463
00:39:25,965 --> 00:39:27,965
My name is Miss Dunn.

464
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,120
Yes.

465
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:36,968
Thank you. Once again, please, and speak.

466
00:39:37,068 --> 00:39:39,068
My name is Daniel.

467
00:39:40,261 --> 00:39:42,261
Very good, Daniel.

468
00:39:43,669 --> 00:39:45,285
And... your name?

469
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:47,385
My name is Bonnie.

470
00:39:48,598 --> 00:39:50,598
Thank you, Bonnie.

471
00:39:52,554 --> 00:39:54,554
I am Daniel Tu.

472
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:59,100
Excelent. But 'too' is spelled 'T-O-O'.

473
00:40:06,979 --> 00:40:09,379
Your family name is 'Tu'...

474
00:40:09,671 --> 00:40:11,250
I'm sorry, I apologize.

475
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:13,650
Daniel Tu, right?

476
00:40:17,846 --> 00:40:19,846
No name? No name?

477
00:40:20,693 --> 00:40:22,501
Maybe she's dumb.

478
00:40:22,601 --> 00:40:25,236
Oh, no, no, no. Deaf, not dumb.

479
00:40:25,873 --> 00:40:27,594
Dumb means stupid.

480
00:40:27,694 --> 00:40:31,264
You, all of you, are very bright students.

481
00:40:33,411 --> 00:40:35,411
Oh, thank you. Amy?

482
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:39,600
Now, every name has a special meaning.

483
00:40:40,902 --> 00:40:43,402
Daniel means 'judge'.

484
00:40:44,592 --> 00:40:47,592
Bonnie means 'very good'.

485
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:51,413
And Amy, means...

486
00:40:53,153 --> 00:40:55,952
'beloved'. That means...

487
00:40:56,047 --> 00:40:59,022
that everyone loves that person.

488
00:41:02,236 --> 00:41:04,236
One minute, wait.

489
00:41:05,553 --> 00:41:08,273
Did you forget your hearing aid?

490
00:41:10,579 --> 00:41:13,554
Okay, well, use the school's, okay?

491
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,740
Right. Very good, Bonnie, very good.

492
00:41:21,703 --> 00:41:24,997
After we see how good you are
at spelling, then we'll play...

493
00:41:25,097 --> 00:41:27,562
a game with numbers. Okay?

494
00:41:31,932 --> 00:41:33,610
I like your name.

495
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:36,010
You don't have to write it...

496
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:38,309
but, please?

497
00:41:42,842 --> 00:41:45,333
Okay, everybody, it's time to go.

498
00:41:45,433 --> 00:41:47,433
Bye bye.

499
00:41:47,537 --> 00:41:50,036
You forgot, Daniel.

500
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:09,226
- Let's go.
- Are you Amy's brother? I'm...

501
00:42:09,326 --> 00:42:11,326
I don't read that mess.

502
00:42:27,486 --> 00:42:29,486
Wonderful, Amy.

503
00:42:29,659 --> 00:42:31,659
I love you too.

504
00:42:36,313 --> 00:42:38,313
Let's go.

505
00:43:43,805 --> 00:43:45,805
And say it.

506
00:43:46,158 --> 00:43:48,158
Mul-ti-ply...

507
00:43:49,269 --> 00:43:52,329
That's better... that's pretty good.

508
00:43:52,535 --> 00:43:55,255
We're going to try again, now...

509
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,230
That's very good, okay. Now...

510
00:44:08,868 --> 00:44:11,468
mul-ti-ply...

511
00:45:24,089 --> 00:45:26,299
Yeah, I've seen the movie.

512
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:28,944
Al Pacino is something?

513
00:45:35,624 --> 00:45:36,827
You alone?

514
00:45:40,018 --> 00:45:41,319
Come here a lot?

515
00:45:46,374 --> 00:45:48,374
You're okay.

516
00:45:48,961 --> 00:45:52,419
With most of the others you never talk,
you know, but you're okay.

517
00:45:58,947 --> 00:46:01,433
I'm gonna make you an offer
you can't refuse.

518
00:46:01,533 --> 00:46:03,064
Ha. Oh, really?

519
00:46:03,164 --> 00:46:06,564
- You'd want me in your bed, right?
- Yeah?

520
00:46:06,623 --> 00:46:08,663
Why can't I refuse?

521
00:46:10,511 --> 00:46:14,931
Well, you'd be passing up
the best fuck of your life.

522
00:46:16,654 --> 00:46:18,654
Okay, well...

523
00:46:19,127 --> 00:46:21,127
in that case...

524
00:46:30,987 --> 00:46:32,987
Hey, Frankie.

525
00:46:33,074 --> 00:46:35,199
Hey, man, how's business?

526
00:46:37,347 --> 00:46:39,347
I'll catch you later.

527
00:46:41,494 --> 00:46:44,809
- See you in September.
- Bye-bye, Daniel.

528
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,300
Bye, Erin.

529
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,489
- Have a nice summer.
- Happy vacation to you.

530
00:46:51,589 --> 00:46:54,564
- See you after Labor Day.
- Oh, okay.

531
00:46:57,936 --> 00:47:00,736
Amy, these are cookies, for you.

532
00:47:10,876 --> 00:47:13,177
My name is Miss Dunn.

533
00:47:17,859 --> 00:47:19,859
My name is Miss Dunn.

534
00:47:23,824 --> 00:47:26,623
Yeah, you did it. You spoke.

535
00:47:26,712 --> 00:47:28,681
That's wonderful, Amy.
That's wonderful.

536
00:47:28,781 --> 00:47:30,821
Now, let's try it again.

537
00:47:40,201 --> 00:47:42,201
She did it. She spoke.

538
00:47:43,325 --> 00:47:44,998
Let's go.

539
00:47:45,098 --> 00:47:46,933
This afternoon, do you think
she could stay with me?

540
00:47:47,033 --> 00:47:51,198
Today is... sort of a special day,
for both of us.

541
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:55,371
Thanks.

542
00:48:05,702 --> 00:48:07,236
- Rules. Rules, Mrs. Jackson.
- I'm late.

543
00:48:07,336 --> 00:48:09,634
When you and the children live on welfare...

544
00:48:09,734 --> 00:48:11,926
- Animals in the zoo live better.
- Is not enough for the three of you.

545
00:48:12,026 --> 00:48:13,699
- So your man friend has to leave.
- The man stays.

546
00:48:13,799 --> 00:48:14,961
They'll cut off your welfare...

547
00:48:15,061 --> 00:48:16,652
and without welfare,
you cannot support your children.

548
00:48:16,752 --> 00:48:17,866
You try to raise two kids.

549
00:48:17,966 --> 00:48:20,453
Their father went someplace...
I don't know where are the rules.

550
00:48:20,553 --> 00:48:23,046
You try working all day and
half the night out there...

551
00:48:23,146 --> 00:48:24,526
with your damn rules.

552
00:48:24,626 --> 00:48:27,967
Now, I got a right to something.
And that something is that man.

553
00:48:28,067 --> 00:48:30,067
And that man stays.

554
00:48:30,598 --> 00:48:32,458
Honey, where've you been?

555
00:48:32,558 --> 00:48:34,731
You scared your momma half to death.

556
00:48:34,831 --> 00:48:36,345
Oh, you got a pretty thing...

557
00:48:36,445 --> 00:48:38,200
- Mrs. Jackson, I'm...
- Now what?

558
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,425
She's the teacher, Momma.

559
00:48:41,253 --> 00:48:43,653
My boy said she talked.

560
00:48:45,044 --> 00:48:48,444
See, honey? Somebody up there loves you.

561
00:48:48,513 --> 00:48:52,168
We'll have a nice long talk in the morning.

562
00:48:55,183 --> 00:48:56,758
Mrs. Jackson, excuse me...

563
00:48:56,858 --> 00:48:59,465
If... if Amy had her own hearing aid,
I know they're very expensive...

564
00:48:59,565 --> 00:49:01,692
but at school, she'd learn so much faster.

565
00:49:01,792 --> 00:49:03,773
And at home, she wouldn't be shut out.

566
00:49:03,873 --> 00:49:06,723
Can you imagine what it'd be like
for her to hear laughter?

567
00:49:06,823 --> 00:49:08,749
Ain't heard it lately myself.

568
00:49:08,849 --> 00:49:11,488
Hey, you're a nice lady.
But you heard the man...

569
00:49:11,588 --> 00:49:13,187
He pulls the plug.

570
00:49:13,287 --> 00:49:15,922
No welfare. No school. Nothing.

571
00:49:16,016 --> 00:49:17,705
Him?

572
00:49:17,805 --> 00:49:19,805
Him.

573
00:49:21,271 --> 00:49:23,034
Well, Mrs. Jackson's got a lover...

574
00:49:23,134 --> 00:49:25,301
so what? You and your welfare got
something against...

575
00:49:25,401 --> 00:49:26,924
I don't care if she's got fifty lovers...

576
00:49:27,024 --> 00:49:28,911
but if one of them starts
living off her welfare...

577
00:49:29,011 --> 00:49:30,511
Little Amy goes down the drain, right?

578
00:49:30,611 --> 00:49:33,925
- Look, why are you hanging this on me?
- Because you're pulling the strings.

579
00:49:34,025 --> 00:49:35,439
Love will find a way, right?

580
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:36,738
You care about Amy?

581
00:49:36,838 --> 00:49:38,835
- Why do you think I work in welfare?
- Okay, okay, why?

582
00:49:38,935 --> 00:49:40,979
Because I'm a lousy liberal,
I want to save the world.

583
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:42,628
Oh, come on, screw the world.
Save Amy.

584
00:49:42,728 --> 00:49:44,790
- I don't make the rules.
- You make the report?

585
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:46,984
- Yeah, but I report the truth.
- All right, then, lie.

586
00:49:47,084 --> 00:49:49,318
The end justifies the means, right?

587
00:49:49,418 --> 00:49:51,418
If it means Amy stays in school, yes.

588
00:49:51,518 --> 00:49:54,578
Miss? I'd like to see you again.

589
00:49:54,766 --> 00:49:56,766
What for?

590
00:50:05,014 --> 00:50:07,014
Hello?

591
00:50:09,609 --> 00:50:11,609
Where are you?

592
00:50:23,442 --> 00:50:26,077
Oh... I don't feel very well...

593
00:50:26,506 --> 00:50:28,631
I couldn't drive anymore.

594
00:50:28,824 --> 00:50:30,864
Is it cold? I'm so cold.

595
00:50:34,494 --> 00:50:36,619
Oh. My Rock of Gibraltar.

596
00:50:38,546 --> 00:50:41,673
You know, the last time I was a mess...

597
00:50:41,773 --> 00:50:48,063
but this doctor was supposed to be
the best safecracker in the business.

598
00:50:50,135 --> 00:50:53,661
Isn't that a perfect name for an abortionist?

599
00:50:53,761 --> 00:50:55,449
Did you tell Barney?

600
00:50:55,549 --> 00:50:58,864
- No...
- But he's crazy in love with you.

601
00:50:58,913 --> 00:51:00,953
He doesn't even know me.

602
00:51:02,204 --> 00:51:04,754
Oh, it started out just great.

603
00:51:05,259 --> 00:51:06,554
No matter what we did...

604
00:51:06,654 --> 00:51:08,694
everything was great.

605
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:11,130
Every day was special.

606
00:51:12,956 --> 00:51:16,056
And then... one day...

607
00:51:17,267 --> 00:51:18,630
we couldn't talk.

608
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:22,640
We couldn't talk or...
even look at each other.

609
00:51:23,301 --> 00:51:26,001
So, we... we joined the crowd.

610
00:51:27,278 --> 00:51:30,423
Booze, happy dust, uppers, downers...

611
00:51:31,611 --> 00:51:34,511
Last night, I woke up...

612
00:51:36,175 --> 00:51:39,275
in a room full of naked asses.

613
00:51:42,164 --> 00:51:44,164
Mine was one of them.

614
00:51:47,108 --> 00:51:50,168
I guess that's all I've ever been...

615
00:51:50,772 --> 00:51:52,982
Just another piece of ass.

616
00:51:55,284 --> 00:51:56,973
- Married?
- No.

617
00:51:57,073 --> 00:51:59,198
- Presently living with a man?
- No.

618
00:51:59,298 --> 00:52:00,844
How frequently do you have intercourse?

619
00:52:00,944 --> 00:52:04,057
- Does it matter?
- Yes. There are several methods...

620
00:52:04,157 --> 00:52:07,906
- Diaphragm, IUD, pill...
- I just wanna make sure of one thing.

621
00:52:08,006 --> 00:52:09,506
No kids.

622
00:52:09,606 --> 00:52:11,607
- Permanently?
- Yes.

623
00:52:12,008 --> 00:52:14,008
- May I ask why?
- No.

624
00:52:15,247 --> 00:52:18,746
- Good morning, class.
- Good morning, Miss Dunn.

625
00:52:18,846 --> 00:52:20,886
Good morning, Miss Dunn.

626
00:52:24,728 --> 00:52:27,376
Oh. It's a wonderful morning, Amy.

627
00:52:27,476 --> 00:52:30,366
It's a wonderful morning. Come on.

628
00:52:32,081 --> 00:52:33,549
Good evening.

629
00:52:33,649 --> 00:52:35,631
How's little Amy Jackson?

630
00:52:35,731 --> 00:52:37,098
Oh. Hey.

631
00:52:37,198 --> 00:52:39,352
All she needed was a chance
and your lie gave it to her.

632
00:52:39,452 --> 00:52:41,705
Well, I didn't exactly lied.
Just didn't tell the whole truth.

633
00:52:41,805 --> 00:52:44,077
I don't know, I just don't know,
a new hearing aid...

634
00:52:44,177 --> 00:52:46,797
I don't know how you got it or where
but really... thanks a lot.

635
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:49,533
- Thank Child Welfare.
- Yeah, well, so...

636
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:51,315
So... how about dinner?

637
00:52:51,415 --> 00:52:52,733
I'm taking you, okay?

638
00:52:52,833 --> 00:52:57,083
Listen, we'd better move it.
They eat by the clock.

639
00:53:22,884 --> 00:53:25,851
I know he was a catholic.
He studied for the priesthood.

640
00:53:25,951 --> 00:53:28,387
Gave it up when his father died...

641
00:53:28,487 --> 00:53:30,837
to support his sickly mother.

642
00:53:30,937 --> 00:53:33,657
They all live in the same house.

643
00:53:33,896 --> 00:53:35,169
Family.

644
00:53:35,269 --> 00:53:37,080
If he got to Notre Dame...

645
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:39,900
he could have been canonized.

646
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:41,950
Yeah...

647
00:53:42,034 --> 00:53:44,525
- Your father is an incredible character.
- Yup.

648
00:53:44,625 --> 00:53:46,775
Your mother's a fabulous cook.
I bet you're a great cook.

649
00:53:46,875 --> 00:53:48,429
I hate cooking.
I hate baseball, basketball...

650
00:53:48,529 --> 00:53:50,259
and specially, Notre Dame football.

651
00:53:50,359 --> 00:53:52,375
I hate jokes. Irish, polish, italian...

652
00:53:52,475 --> 00:53:53,950
I hate jokes, period.

653
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:56,783
- Are you upset?
- No. I'm not upset.

654
00:53:56,883 --> 00:53:58,375
What is it? Me?

655
00:53:58,475 --> 00:54:00,946
Something I said? Something I did?

656
00:54:01,046 --> 00:54:03,046
- What?
- Nothing.

657
00:54:03,091 --> 00:54:05,714
I know someone else who said
the same thing once.

658
00:54:05,814 --> 00:54:08,619
I just realized how funny it was.

659
00:54:29,123 --> 00:54:31,123
Looking for me?

660
00:54:33,393 --> 00:54:35,393
Tony Lo Panto.

661
00:54:36,529 --> 00:54:39,329
Sonja Katerina Raskolnikov.

662
00:54:42,447 --> 00:54:43,801
Well, that's okay.

663
00:54:43,901 --> 00:54:45,519
I knew a secretary once, named...

664
00:54:45,619 --> 00:54:48,254
named... Sonia... something.

665
00:54:50,397 --> 00:54:52,807
She used to cry all the time,
even when she was happy.

666
00:54:52,907 --> 00:54:55,435
Yeah? I never cry, even when I'm sad.

667
00:54:55,535 --> 00:54:58,255
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it's a God's truth.

668
00:54:58,859 --> 00:55:00,831
Nobody tells the truth. Ever.

669
00:55:00,931 --> 00:55:03,426
Well, maybe it's better that way.

670
00:55:03,526 --> 00:55:06,841
- Yeah, that's the friggin' truth.
- Yeah.

671
00:55:13,841 --> 00:55:16,561
What is this? You a Bible freak?

672
00:55:16,779 --> 00:55:20,604
It was a different book the last time we met.

673
00:55:21,889 --> 00:55:24,014
- When we met where?
- Here.

674
00:55:24,519 --> 00:55:26,854
Here. Well, I mean, not exactly...

675
00:55:26,954 --> 00:55:29,079
'met'. You were...

676
00:55:29,499 --> 00:55:32,302
you were with a blonde.

677
00:55:32,402 --> 00:55:34,527
- You noticed?
- Yeah...

678
00:55:35,048 --> 00:55:37,513
You were... you were doing...

679
00:55:37,823 --> 00:55:39,823
you were doing that.

680
00:55:41,749 --> 00:55:43,211
What? Are you putting me on?

681
00:55:43,311 --> 00:55:45,311
Oh, no, no...

682
00:55:46,608 --> 00:55:49,413
No, I'm just feeling really good.

683
00:55:50,697 --> 00:55:53,199
- Does the wine don't hurt either?
- No...

684
00:55:53,299 --> 00:55:55,299
The wine don't hurt.

685
00:56:12,982 --> 00:56:15,277
You said there was a party.

686
00:56:16,518 --> 00:56:18,643
So where's the party?

687
00:56:19,735 --> 00:56:21,735
Here.

688
00:56:23,708 --> 00:56:25,708
Right...

689
00:56:25,748 --> 00:56:27,748
here.

690
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:05,469
- You liked that?
- Yeah.

691
00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:11,132
Man is a...

692
00:58:11,232 --> 00:58:13,633
a wonderful thing. Yeah.

693
00:58:20,144 --> 00:58:22,144
God.

694
00:58:24,395 --> 00:58:26,395
It... it's still hard.

695
00:58:28,776 --> 00:58:30,776
Why did you stop?

696
00:58:31,653 --> 00:58:33,653
What's the hurry?

697
00:58:35,016 --> 00:58:37,016
How can you hold back?

698
00:58:40,187 --> 00:58:42,482
What are you doing? What...

699
00:58:58,206 --> 00:59:00,926
Oh, very clever books, you know.

700
00:59:02,646 --> 00:59:05,366
Myself, I care for poems.

701
00:59:08,706 --> 00:59:11,399
Guys always make passes
at girls with bare asses.

702
00:59:11,499 --> 00:59:13,499
More.

703
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,990
You'll never have a nack
till you make it with a black.

704
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,576
Where did you read that?

705
00:59:21,676 --> 00:59:23,676
In the subway toilette.

706
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:57,158
Kill the light.

707
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:00,670
Off.

708
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:49,980
Scare you?

709
01:00:52,809 --> 01:00:55,189
Turns you on, too, don't it?

710
01:00:55,581 --> 01:00:57,183
Knowing you can't stop it, knowing...

711
01:00:57,283 --> 01:00:59,283
you can't run.

712
01:00:59,916 --> 01:01:02,466
Just waiting for it to happen.

713
01:01:02,613 --> 01:01:05,758
Heart pumping a mile a minute, right?

714
01:01:05,997 --> 01:01:07,997
Damn right.

715
01:01:08,675 --> 01:01:10,506
Have you killed anybody?

716
01:01:10,606 --> 01:01:12,606
Sure.

717
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:15,419
In Vietnam.

718
01:01:16,053 --> 01:01:18,433
Is that where you got these?

719
01:01:19,953 --> 01:01:22,284
Where do you think? Miami Beach?

720
01:01:22,384 --> 01:01:24,934
- It's a rotten thing.
- Naahh...

721
01:01:25,059 --> 01:01:27,059
Got me out of the war.

722
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:31,285
You don't get enough?

723
01:01:34,685 --> 01:01:35,991
- Hey, what's that?
- What?

724
01:01:36,091 --> 01:01:38,896
- Why? Does it bother you?
- No, no.

725
01:01:45,217 --> 01:01:47,217
Cheek to cheek.

726
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:49,780
You like that?

727
01:02:00,173 --> 01:02:02,553
- In case we fell asleep.
- So?

728
01:02:03,772 --> 01:02:06,322
So you'd leave before morning.

729
01:02:06,398 --> 01:02:08,224
Oh, what's that? A house rule?

730
01:02:08,324 --> 01:02:09,820
The only one.

731
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:13,235
- So, what happens in the morning?
- Work.

732
01:02:13,431 --> 01:02:15,431
Oh, yeah? Who is he?

733
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:17,832
- Husband?
- Right.

734
01:02:18,024 --> 01:02:20,999
- Can be... milkman...
- Right, right.

735
01:02:21,452 --> 01:02:23,832
Some guy that pays the rent?

736
01:02:24,936 --> 01:02:26,936
Comes daylight work.

737
01:02:27,132 --> 01:02:29,132
I gotta be alone.

738
01:02:31,303 --> 01:02:33,513
Nothing... nothing personal.

739
01:02:34,561 --> 01:02:36,601
Who said I want to stay?

740
01:02:39,855 --> 01:02:43,340
You expect me to believe that alone crap?

741
01:02:43,617 --> 01:02:45,657
Work... What kinda work?

742
01:02:47,354 --> 01:02:49,354
I'm a teacher.

743
01:02:54,175 --> 01:02:56,175
School?

744
01:02:57,488 --> 01:02:59,488
First grade.

745
01:02:59,744 --> 01:03:01,744
I don't believe it.

746
01:03:02,822 --> 01:03:04,822
I don't believe it.

747
01:03:05,924 --> 01:03:09,266
Teacher of little kids
cruising crummy bars?

748
01:03:09,366 --> 01:03:10,587
Jesus Christ.

749
01:03:10,687 --> 01:03:14,087
No wonder this country's all screwed up.

750
01:03:14,782 --> 01:03:16,782
But you liked it?

751
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:18,900
You're the greatest.

752
01:03:25,705 --> 01:03:27,705
I'll keep in touch.

753
01:03:28,975 --> 01:03:31,015
Sunday night, six sharp.

754
01:03:31,907 --> 01:03:33,909
You just be here.

755
01:03:34,266 --> 01:03:36,266
Okay? Sonja...'Bologna'

756
01:03:36,615 --> 01:03:38,216
Hey, hey...

757
01:03:38,316 --> 01:03:40,316
Your fly is open.

758
01:03:40,603 --> 01:03:43,748
Of course... I gotta go to work, too.

759
01:03:45,439 --> 01:03:47,639
God. I don't believe it.

760
01:03:49,061 --> 01:03:51,526
I don't... I don't believe it.

761
01:03:52,467 --> 01:03:53,833
Paw.

762
01:03:53,933 --> 01:03:55,381
Plenty.

763
01:03:55,481 --> 01:03:56,901
Please.

764
01:03:57,001 --> 01:03:58,057
Pow.

765
01:03:58,157 --> 01:04:01,457
Those letters make air rush out.

766
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:04,422
Now, say it.

767
01:04:12,667 --> 01:04:13,816
Very good.

768
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:16,181
I want you to think of words...

769
01:04:16,281 --> 01:04:18,712
that make the air rush out.

770
01:04:18,812 --> 01:04:21,712
Punch. Punch. Punch.

771
01:04:25,706 --> 01:04:28,671
No, no, no...
Too much 'punch, punch, punch.'

772
01:04:28,771 --> 01:04:30,896
I want you to try 'help'.

773
01:04:30,951 --> 01:04:34,051
- Help. Help. Help.
- Yeah... better.

774
01:04:35,032 --> 01:04:37,838
And then, this perfect little gentleman...

775
01:04:37,938 --> 01:04:40,988
- Comes out with the word 'fuck'.
- That must have burst the baloon.

776
01:04:41,088 --> 01:04:44,644
So I told him to find another word.
Then he said that he tried 'love'.

777
01:04:44,744 --> 01:04:48,234
- But 'love' wouldn't move the baloon.
- Never has.

778
01:04:48,334 --> 01:04:50,879
So, I told him 'happy'
would move the baloon. He said...

779
01:04:50,979 --> 01:04:52,938
is 'happy' the same as 'fuck'?

780
01:04:53,038 --> 01:04:54,582
Not with my husband.

781
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:56,682
Oh, ha ha, I see...

782
01:04:56,743 --> 01:04:59,575
Anyway, it is over. Finished. The end.

783
01:04:59,675 --> 01:05:01,186
Tonight, Acapulco...

784
01:05:01,286 --> 01:05:03,618
- Tomorrow, I am free.
- Does Poppa know?

785
01:05:03,718 --> 01:05:06,154
Oh, yeah. Naturally,
he blamed it on Barney.

786
01:05:06,254 --> 01:05:09,852
As for a catholic getting divorced,
he said I wasn't married in church...

787
01:05:09,952 --> 01:05:12,908
so it wasn't a marriage in the first place.

788
01:05:13,008 --> 01:05:14,760
How did Barney take it?

789
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:18,005
Barney? Oh. Barney took it real hard.

790
01:05:18,278 --> 01:05:21,317
He's already shagged up with
a teeny bopper with a maxi mouth...

791
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:23,209
a mini brain, dirty feet.

792
01:05:23,309 --> 01:05:25,519
Oh, yes. They also have...

793
01:05:25,772 --> 01:05:27,799
his and her towels, his and her...

794
01:05:27,899 --> 01:05:31,044
hairdryers, his and her vibrators.

795
01:05:38,787 --> 01:05:40,787
Here lies love.

796
01:05:40,847 --> 01:05:43,312
And lies and lies and lies...

797
01:05:45,337 --> 01:05:47,547
- Taxi.
- I'll be right down.

798
01:05:48,869 --> 01:05:51,249
Listen. Anything you want...

799
01:05:52,173 --> 01:05:53,763
Take it, just...

800
01:05:53,863 --> 01:05:55,247
take it all.

801
01:05:55,347 --> 01:05:57,347
Stay loose, baby.

802
01:06:49,507 --> 01:06:51,507
Hello?

803
01:06:53,035 --> 01:06:55,035
James who?

804
01:06:56,220 --> 01:07:00,725
Of course, I've been keeping busy.
I'm busy right now.

805
01:07:01,466 --> 01:07:05,631
Frankly, I haven't even had time
to think of food.

806
01:07:05,949 --> 01:07:07,949
Well...

807
01:07:08,419 --> 01:07:10,401
Can you call back in ten minutes?

808
01:07:10,501 --> 01:07:13,221
No, wait. Better make it twenty.

809
01:07:15,886 --> 01:07:17,886
Shit...

810
01:07:47,272 --> 01:07:49,272
Hey, Chuck.

811
01:07:49,512 --> 01:07:52,480
- What's up there, man? Got any shit?
- You got any bread?

812
01:07:52,580 --> 01:07:54,580
I got the bread, baby.

813
01:07:54,869 --> 01:07:56,287
Let me look at it.

814
01:07:56,387 --> 01:07:57,768
Let me smell it.

815
01:07:57,868 --> 01:07:59,321
Smells good.

816
01:07:59,421 --> 01:08:01,031
It is good.

817
01:08:01,131 --> 01:08:03,681
Hey, Chuck. Got any shit, man?

818
01:08:03,831 --> 01:08:06,976
Hey, baby. You look full of it, baby.

819
01:08:31,914 --> 01:08:33,860
- Come on in, baby.
- Oh, Jesus.

820
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:35,472
Calling for me?

821
01:08:35,572 --> 01:08:37,244
I was just looking for the ladies room.

822
01:08:37,344 --> 01:08:39,344
Where's the ladies?

823
01:08:43,787 --> 01:08:47,348
You looking for this shit,
white lady named Bernice.

824
01:08:47,448 --> 01:08:49,448
- Got a dime?
- A dime?

825
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:52,740
Yes... a dime, here.

826
01:09:06,212 --> 01:09:08,212
One dope enough?

827
01:09:08,796 --> 01:09:10,796
Yes... yes.

828
01:09:15,653 --> 01:09:18,118
In case you gotta call Jesus.

829
01:09:54,477 --> 01:09:55,777
Me on TV.

830
01:09:55,877 --> 01:09:58,208
Me in the mirror. Me, the star.

831
01:09:58,308 --> 01:10:01,350
That's why everybody goes there.
Everybody gets to be somebody.

832
01:10:01,450 --> 01:10:03,500
- Like that girl?
- She was a terrific kisser?

833
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,719
- She's a nice girl.
- Yeah, big dancer, I'll say that.

834
01:10:05,819 --> 01:10:09,413
She's like a lot of girls. Alone,
cruises the bars alone. It's pretty sad.

835
01:10:09,513 --> 01:10:11,493
Cheer up. They don't always leave alone.

836
01:10:11,593 --> 01:10:13,513
You've never been in that bar before.

837
01:10:13,613 --> 01:10:15,613
Right?

838
01:10:15,779 --> 01:10:17,711
- Right. Right.
- So, why did you wanna go?

839
01:10:17,811 --> 01:10:20,224
- It makes me feel good.
- You didn't know anybody there.

840
01:10:20,324 --> 01:10:22,348
It's better that way, you know?
You drink and you dance...

841
01:10:22,448 --> 01:10:25,081
none of that awkward small talk.

842
01:10:25,181 --> 01:10:27,321
Hey. We didn't have dinner yet.

843
01:10:27,421 --> 01:10:30,296
I'm a great cook. I fry an egg.
I fry a hot-dog.

844
01:10:30,396 --> 01:10:32,759
- Well... school tomorrow, so...
- Saturday.

845
01:10:32,859 --> 01:10:36,854
- Saturday.
- Yeah... you better call first, okay?

846
01:10:57,681 --> 01:10:59,681
Out.

847
01:11:01,073 --> 01:11:05,628
How did you get in here?
What'd you do? Picked the lock?

848
01:11:05,728 --> 01:11:07,389
I knew it. A burglar.

849
01:11:07,489 --> 01:11:09,489
Just get out...

850
01:11:13,975 --> 01:11:16,545
Hey, wait, wait a minute, what is this?

851
01:11:16,645 --> 01:11:19,439
- You said six o'clock, didn't you?
- So?

852
01:11:19,539 --> 01:11:21,738
So... beat it. Out.

853
01:11:23,773 --> 01:11:27,003
Tony gonna tell you what is out about.

854
01:11:38,030 --> 01:11:40,394
Hey, what's your name? Terry Out?

855
01:11:40,494 --> 01:11:43,809
Where did you get the arty-farty porno?

856
01:11:44,538 --> 01:11:49,298
Where did you get that sudden
five-finger licking accent?

857
01:11:49,476 --> 01:11:51,413
Mick Jagger has one, Joe Cocker...

858
01:11:51,513 --> 01:11:53,426
Elton John, The Beatles.

859
01:11:53,526 --> 01:11:55,494
Peter Frampton, Rod Stewart...

860
01:11:55,594 --> 01:11:59,334
Black is mean, mean is bread,
bread is flash.

861
01:12:02,075 --> 01:12:04,774
Volare... wo-oh...

862
01:12:05,872 --> 01:12:08,167
Cantare... woh-oh-woh-oh...

863
01:12:09,836 --> 01:12:11,606
Hey, who's the blonde?

864
01:12:11,706 --> 01:12:13,092
Looks good enough to eat.

865
01:12:13,192 --> 01:12:15,572
Out. Before I call the cops.

866
01:12:34,453 --> 01:12:36,453
No. No. It's late.

867
01:12:54,422 --> 01:12:56,802
Right. I knew it. I knew it.

868
01:12:57,140 --> 01:13:00,200
A burglar and a junkie. Just... Out.

869
01:13:04,878 --> 01:13:09,468
Come on, teach... Pull this one
over me from the start.

870
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:12,340
'Snow', baby.

871
01:13:12,467 --> 01:13:13,837
'Dime-bag'.

872
01:13:13,937 --> 01:13:16,937
'White Lady'.'Bernice'.

873
01:13:17,587 --> 01:13:19,219
You're a coke head.

874
01:13:19,319 --> 01:13:21,185
No.

875
01:13:21,285 --> 01:13:23,285
- Yeah.
- No. No.

876
01:13:24,252 --> 01:13:26,951
Well, I said... cocaine...

877
01:13:27,676 --> 01:13:29,676
cocaine...

878
01:13:29,996 --> 01:13:33,226
burn all around, pop in my brain...

879
01:13:36,744 --> 01:13:41,419
- Where did you get this stuff?
- You'll never believe it.

880
01:13:44,008 --> 01:13:45,863
Ten dollars for that?

881
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:47,963
Thirty, for good stuff.

882
01:13:48,167 --> 01:13:50,167
Hey, come here quick.

883
01:13:50,636 --> 01:13:53,679
Cocaine gonna make your bo bo so sick.

884
01:13:53,779 --> 01:13:56,263
All around, my heart, my brain...

885
01:13:56,363 --> 01:13:58,746
What's this do? What does it do?

886
01:13:58,846 --> 01:14:01,141
It makes America beautiful.

887
01:14:01,434 --> 01:14:03,734
Okay... okay...

888
01:14:05,830 --> 01:14:09,230
- Now, the other one.
- Yeah. Okay... okay.

889
01:15:58,639 --> 01:16:00,639
Don't stop.

890
01:16:00,848 --> 01:16:02,848
Don't... stop...

891
01:16:03,982 --> 01:16:05,982
Oh, I want...

892
01:16:06,595 --> 01:16:08,597
What? What do you want?

893
01:16:09,497 --> 01:16:11,497
Everything.

894
01:16:39,927 --> 01:16:41,927
Volare...

895
01:16:45,974 --> 01:16:47,975
Cantare...

896
01:17:04,992 --> 01:17:07,217
What's so important about
that ridiculous box?

897
01:17:07,317 --> 01:17:10,251
- How can you watch that when you know...
- That box keeps me company...

898
01:17:10,351 --> 01:17:11,953
even when I'm sleeping.

899
01:17:12,053 --> 01:17:15,344
That's the only box I don't have to
screw all the time to keep it happy.

900
01:17:15,444 --> 01:17:17,777
God. You're crude. You're crude bastard.

901
01:17:17,877 --> 01:17:20,838
You're vain, vulgar, you're a liar...
God knows what you are.

902
01:17:20,938 --> 01:17:22,410
Yeah... the perfect gentleman.

903
01:17:22,510 --> 01:17:24,267
Where... where are you going?

904
01:17:24,367 --> 01:17:26,480
- Business.
- Two, three in the morning?

905
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:28,558
What? I don't understand.
What kind of business?

906
01:17:28,658 --> 01:17:30,196
Is it woman business? Woman?

907
01:17:30,296 --> 01:17:32,008
- Take these.
- No.

908
01:17:32,108 --> 01:17:34,108
- No.
- Take it.

909
01:17:35,995 --> 01:17:38,380
Look, you wanna climb walls all night?

910
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:41,392
Wanna drag like shit at school?
Is that what you want?

911
01:17:41,492 --> 01:17:42,465
- What is it?
- Take it.

912
01:17:42,565 --> 01:17:43,947
- What is it?
- Lude.

913
01:17:44,047 --> 01:17:46,047
- Oh. Nice.
- Quaalude.

914
01:17:46,116 --> 01:17:48,116
Brings it down fast.

915
01:17:49,850 --> 01:17:52,060
- I'll keep in touch.
- When?

916
01:17:52,352 --> 01:17:53,623
Whenever.

917
01:17:53,723 --> 01:17:56,868
- If you're late again...
- Kiss my ass.

918
01:17:58,281 --> 01:18:00,281
I did.

919
01:18:27,011 --> 01:18:29,011
Oh, no. No.

920
01:18:39,918 --> 01:18:41,918
Explain it to them.

921
01:18:52,292 --> 01:18:54,292
Stop.

922
01:19:09,235 --> 01:19:11,235
Be quiet.

923
01:19:11,779 --> 01:19:13,779
Sit.

924
01:19:18,681 --> 01:19:20,681
I'm sorry.

925
01:19:20,894 --> 01:19:22,578
I apologize.

926
01:19:22,678 --> 01:19:24,678
I'm late.

927
01:19:25,105 --> 01:19:27,400
Last night I took a pill...

928
01:19:27,566 --> 01:19:29,566
to help me sleep.

929
01:19:30,688 --> 01:19:32,813
The pill was so strong...

930
01:19:34,169 --> 01:19:36,889
- That I...
- I don't believe it.

931
01:19:38,192 --> 01:19:40,192
I don't believe it...

932
01:19:57,229 --> 01:19:58,721
- I gotta go home.
- How is he?

933
01:19:58,821 --> 01:20:00,480
I gotta go home. I gotta see the baby.

934
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:02,950
I've been here since last night.

935
01:20:03,050 --> 01:20:04,860
- Why didn't you call me?
- I did.

936
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:06,535
Nobody home.

937
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:08,422
Later... busy, busy, busy.

938
01:20:08,522 --> 01:20:10,000
I called the operator and say 'cut in'

939
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:12,176
She tells me the phone is off the hook.

940
01:20:12,276 --> 01:20:15,676
I called this morning,
still nobody home.

941
01:20:16,351 --> 01:20:18,351
Stay with Mom?

942
01:20:29,614 --> 01:20:32,759
- How is he? Momma...?
- In God's hands.

943
01:20:33,369 --> 01:20:35,241
Can I see him please?

944
01:20:35,341 --> 01:20:38,486
Well, Theresa, it's been a long time.

945
01:20:38,671 --> 01:20:42,122
Before the operation, we had
a nice chat, your father and I.

946
01:20:42,222 --> 01:20:43,876
He told me the good news...

947
01:20:43,976 --> 01:20:46,655
about that wondrous
young man of yours.

948
01:20:46,755 --> 01:20:49,645
It seems you picked the right man.

949
01:20:50,527 --> 01:20:53,050
- I tried to reach you...
- Do they know?

950
01:20:53,150 --> 01:20:55,700
- Twenty four hours.
- Know what?

951
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:57,851
Know what?

952
01:20:59,667 --> 01:21:01,476
What?

953
01:21:01,576 --> 01:21:03,676
It is malignant.

954
01:21:12,606 --> 01:21:14,426
Can I give you a ride home, Mrs. Dunn?

955
01:21:14,526 --> 01:21:17,429
If it's not too much trouble,
I'd like to go to church first.

956
01:21:17,529 --> 01:21:19,883
You're something, you know?
You're really something.

957
01:21:19,983 --> 01:21:22,679
How did you manage? Jesus.
You practically one of the family.

958
01:21:22,779 --> 01:21:25,825
Apple of my father's eye, buddies,
my mother's son she never had...

959
01:21:25,925 --> 01:21:27,965
- I wanted to help.
- Why?

960
01:21:28,367 --> 01:21:30,503
Why is it when there's trouble
you're always Johnny-On-The-Spot?

961
01:21:30,603 --> 01:21:32,890
Is that how you get your kicks?
Feeding off the crippled?

962
01:21:32,990 --> 01:21:34,264
You're upset, I understand...

963
01:21:34,364 --> 01:21:36,771
- You're worried and you're lonely.
- Alone.

964
01:21:36,871 --> 01:21:39,072
I'm alone. Not lonely.

965
01:21:39,196 --> 01:21:41,199
And depressed.
And you're depressing me.

966
01:21:41,299 --> 01:21:43,339
Can you understand that?

967
01:21:45,650 --> 01:21:48,455
This place isn't like you at all.

968
01:21:51,567 --> 01:21:53,230
Not at all.

969
01:21:53,330 --> 01:21:55,045
It's exactly like me.

970
01:21:55,145 --> 01:21:57,145
Especially this.

971
01:22:00,457 --> 01:22:02,506
You ever had a woman that way?

972
01:22:02,606 --> 01:22:04,094
You got a woman?

973
01:22:04,194 --> 01:22:06,379
How about one of those
welfare cases of yours?

974
01:22:06,479 --> 01:22:11,324
All those scared trembling women
begging for favors...

975
01:22:12,014 --> 01:22:15,831
- I'm going to the hospital tomorrow.
- Of course you will.

976
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:17,716
Hey.

977
01:22:17,816 --> 01:22:20,196
I want you here. Right here.

978
01:22:20,976 --> 01:22:22,709
Or maybe you don't like women.

979
01:22:22,809 --> 01:22:25,104
- Maybe you go to...
- Shut up.

980
01:22:31,047 --> 01:22:35,382
You don't like to hurt people,
so, why do you do it?

981
01:22:42,885 --> 01:22:45,775
I'll pick you up at six, tomorrow.

982
01:22:46,007 --> 01:22:48,007
Good night.

983
01:23:26,267 --> 01:23:28,468
What? Malignant?

984
01:23:28,552 --> 01:23:30,552
Me? No...

985
01:23:30,681 --> 01:23:32,528
That's rumours, sweetheart.

986
01:23:32,628 --> 01:23:35,486
That's all it is. Doctors mambo-jambo.

987
01:23:35,586 --> 01:23:38,731
Yeah, I'll be back at work in a week.

988
01:23:40,017 --> 01:23:43,077
Katherine, love, would I lie to you?

989
01:23:43,187 --> 01:23:46,601
No affliction's gonna bury me
before my time.

990
01:23:46,701 --> 01:23:50,611
Gland tubes or prostate
or any other state?

991
01:24:18,801 --> 01:24:20,901
Hello? Tony?

992
01:24:21,427 --> 01:24:23,428
Tony? Hello?

993
01:24:23,655 --> 01:24:25,655
Are you still there?

994
01:24:26,119 --> 01:24:28,500
Yes, yes, you sound under water too.

995
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:30,600
I can't...

996
01:24:31,933 --> 01:24:33,933
You're gurgling.

997
01:24:35,138 --> 01:24:36,550
What? Am I what?

998
01:24:36,650 --> 01:24:38,691
No, no, I'm fine, I'm fine...

999
01:24:38,791 --> 01:24:41,545
but the phone practically drowned.

1000
01:24:41,645 --> 01:24:44,096
Don't go away. Don't you go away.

1001
01:24:44,196 --> 01:24:46,236
Okay... can you hear me?

1002
01:24:46,678 --> 01:24:48,678
Tony? Hey.

1003
01:24:50,541 --> 01:24:52,921
Tony, just... don't go away.

1004
01:24:58,282 --> 01:25:00,481
No. Just... just barely...

1005
01:25:01,338 --> 01:25:03,338
Yeah. Barely.

1006
01:25:03,547 --> 01:25:06,862
Well, Why don't you come on over?

1007
01:25:07,005 --> 01:25:09,005
No, no. It's James.

1008
01:25:09,104 --> 01:25:11,104
Oh, yuck.

1009
01:25:29,727 --> 01:25:31,727
Hey, Steve.

1010
01:25:37,049 --> 01:25:39,447
Hey. Excuse me.

1011
01:25:46,820 --> 01:25:48,823
Tony Lo Panto, seen him around?

1012
01:25:48,923 --> 01:25:50,426
Gomer man.

1013
01:25:50,526 --> 01:25:54,011
Must be two, three weeks now.
Another one?

1014
01:25:59,184 --> 01:26:01,184
Michael?

1015
01:26:01,377 --> 01:26:03,377
Martin.

1016
01:26:03,433 --> 01:26:06,153
Oh... A professor needs a beard.

1017
01:26:06,830 --> 01:26:08,930
Ex... professor.

1018
01:26:10,029 --> 01:26:12,135
Teaching is a waste of time.

1019
01:26:12,235 --> 01:26:14,506
- I'm writing a novel.
- Isn't everybody?

1020
01:26:14,606 --> 01:26:18,346
- I'm getting divorced, too.
- Isn't everybody?

1021
01:26:18,856 --> 01:26:20,856
To...

1022
01:26:20,999 --> 01:26:22,398
old times.

1023
01:26:22,498 --> 01:26:25,823
Oh, God, no.

1024
01:26:26,521 --> 01:26:29,921
I think about you, us... a lot.
Too much.

1025
01:26:30,158 --> 01:26:32,137
You were my one true love.

1026
01:26:32,237 --> 01:26:33,918
Yes...

1027
01:26:34,018 --> 01:26:36,018
love.

1028
01:26:37,114 --> 01:26:41,534
Forgive me not, but please,
oh please, forget me not.

1029
01:26:43,499 --> 01:26:45,654
My parted lover sayeth this writ...

1030
01:26:45,754 --> 01:26:48,955
Oh, darling, thou art still a shit.

1031
01:26:51,780 --> 01:26:53,780
Ciao.

1032
01:26:57,355 --> 01:26:58,434
That's wrong.

1033
01:26:58,534 --> 01:27:00,534
- Hello.
- Hey...

1034
01:27:01,881 --> 01:27:03,881
Everyone, look at me.

1035
01:27:04,670 --> 01:27:06,859
- This is Mr...
- No, hold it, hold it.

1036
01:27:06,959 --> 01:27:09,259
My name is...

1037
01:27:10,183 --> 01:27:13,483
J-A-M-E-S.

1038
01:27:15,646 --> 01:27:17,686
- James.
- Very, very good.

1039
01:27:18,063 --> 01:27:19,687
It took me four days to learn that.

1040
01:27:19,787 --> 01:27:21,471
Maybe sign language would keep us
from fighting?

1041
01:27:21,571 --> 01:27:23,588
I'd be surprised.
Haven't you had enough?

1042
01:27:23,688 --> 01:27:26,795
- I mean, I've been so awful and...
- You're charming, intelligent...

1043
01:27:26,895 --> 01:27:29,412
affectionate, sensual...
You're the ideal...

1044
01:27:29,512 --> 01:27:31,016
bitch.

1045
01:27:31,116 --> 01:27:33,830
You'd better learn to read Braille.
You're blind as a bat.

1046
01:27:33,930 --> 01:27:36,331
- Saturday.
- You'll be sorry.

1047
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:41,897
It's funny...
I don't remember buying any candy.

1048
01:27:41,997 --> 01:27:43,881
That's right.

1049
01:27:43,981 --> 01:27:45,840
- And the pens.
- Right.

1050
01:27:45,940 --> 01:27:48,502
- That's stealing.
- Yeah... That's right.

1051
01:27:48,602 --> 01:27:54,212
- It would've been easier to pay for it.
- Yeah, but not as much fun.

1052
01:27:54,973 --> 01:27:56,413
You got roaches.

1053
01:27:56,513 --> 01:27:58,167
Poor hungry little buggers.

1054
01:27:58,267 --> 01:28:00,891
Is that why you don't wash the dishes?
Cause the roaches are hungry?

1055
01:28:00,991 --> 01:28:02,991
Why else?

1056
01:28:03,028 --> 01:28:05,028
Why else...

1057
01:28:08,121 --> 01:28:10,753
Most guys, first time out they try
to score, they expect it.

1058
01:28:10,853 --> 01:28:13,243
And some of them get pretty nasty
if they don't get it.

1059
01:28:13,343 --> 01:28:16,586
So by the 2nd or 3rd time, it's either
fuck, fight it or forget it.

1060
01:28:16,686 --> 01:28:19,860
But you, we've seen each other, what?
Five or six times...

1061
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:23,105
you haven't even tried to kiss me.

1062
01:28:23,694 --> 01:28:25,694
Your wine, madam.

1063
01:28:25,998 --> 01:28:27,998
In here, please.

1064
01:28:36,107 --> 01:28:37,580
Just a second...

1065
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:40,551
My hands are very soapy here.

1066
01:28:40,651 --> 01:28:42,651
I'm sorry...

1067
01:28:44,163 --> 01:28:46,564
Mmmmm... Nice... Mmmm...

1068
01:28:49,508 --> 01:28:51,508
Thank you.

1069
01:28:52,036 --> 01:28:54,036
You're welcome.

1070
01:29:01,063 --> 01:29:03,379
Why did you wanna be a priest?

1071
01:29:03,479 --> 01:29:05,479
My father wanted it.

1072
01:29:05,790 --> 01:29:07,475
Didn't you?

1073
01:29:07,575 --> 01:29:08,690
Naaaahhh...

1074
01:29:08,790 --> 01:29:11,034
If he hadn't died,
that's what you'd be.

1075
01:29:11,134 --> 01:29:13,266
- I don't know if he's dead.
- What?

1076
01:29:13,366 --> 01:29:16,807
I just say he's dead.
It stops the questions.

1077
01:29:16,907 --> 01:29:18,489
My mother drank.

1078
01:29:18,589 --> 01:29:20,799
She doesn't drink anymore.

1079
01:29:22,524 --> 01:29:26,094
I was twelve years old when that happened.

1080
01:29:26,968 --> 01:29:30,113
One night I heard my mother laughing.

1081
01:29:30,379 --> 01:29:33,099
My mother had a beautiful laugh.

1082
01:29:33,781 --> 01:29:35,991
The bedroom door was open.

1083
01:29:36,156 --> 01:29:38,876
She was lying on the bed, naked.

1084
01:29:39,095 --> 01:29:41,393
Except for a black garter belt.

1085
01:29:41,493 --> 01:29:43,838
My father was standing over her.

1086
01:29:43,938 --> 01:29:45,938
She was teasing him.

1087
01:29:46,333 --> 01:29:50,460
'Hey, what's the matter big boy?
Can't you get it up?'

1088
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:52,560
My father hit her.

1089
01:29:53,042 --> 01:29:56,272
But my mother just kept on laughing...

1090
01:29:56,775 --> 01:29:59,510
And he kept hitting her,
and hitting her...

1091
01:29:59,610 --> 01:30:02,433
and she kept laughing,
and laughing.

1092
01:30:02,533 --> 01:30:05,170
There was blood all over the bed...

1093
01:30:05,270 --> 01:30:07,650
blood all over my mother.

1094
01:30:08,972 --> 01:30:11,524
My father walked right past me...

1095
01:30:11,624 --> 01:30:15,279
walked down the stairs and out the door.

1096
01:30:43,983 --> 01:30:45,686
I love you.

1097
01:30:45,786 --> 01:30:47,986
Don't love me...

1098
01:30:49,466 --> 01:30:51,466
just... make love.

1099
01:31:00,174 --> 01:31:02,469
Mmmm... let me... let me...

1100
01:31:19,603 --> 01:31:23,102
Is this supposed to protect me or you?
Oh, God.

1101
01:31:23,202 --> 01:31:24,719
Oh Go... I'm sorry.

1102
01:31:24,819 --> 01:31:27,002
Oh, I'm very sorry.
That wasn't very funny.

1103
01:31:27,102 --> 01:31:30,502
It's just... I've never seen one of these.

1104
01:31:31,563 --> 01:31:33,674
Oh, God... Go ahead. Go ahead. Hit me.

1105
01:31:33,774 --> 01:31:35,524
Fight back. Break something.

1106
01:31:35,624 --> 01:31:37,624
I'm... I'm sorry...

1107
01:31:47,599 --> 01:31:49,323
You're wrong...

1108
01:31:49,423 --> 01:31:51,423
it's funny.

1109
01:31:58,590 --> 01:32:01,990
The story about my mother and my father?

1110
01:32:02,122 --> 01:32:04,122
It never happened.

1111
01:32:05,967 --> 01:32:07,967
I'm sorry.

1112
01:32:18,264 --> 01:32:20,264
I gotta get outta here.

1113
01:32:45,170 --> 01:32:46,989
Excuse me. Excuse me...

1114
01:32:47,089 --> 01:32:48,785
I'm looking for Jesus.

1115
01:32:48,885 --> 01:32:50,486
Well, ain't you heard, baby?

1116
01:32:50,586 --> 01:32:52,586
The pigs got him.

1117
01:32:53,488 --> 01:32:55,868
Never fear, the man is here.

1118
01:32:55,915 --> 01:32:57,915
Two dime-bags?

1119
01:33:38,006 --> 01:33:40,675
So, I'm back working for the airlines
but not like before.

1120
01:33:40,775 --> 01:33:42,405
Desk job, public relations.

1121
01:33:42,505 --> 01:33:46,447
No more wedding doors in a plane
loaded of drunken ass-grabbers.

1122
01:33:46,547 --> 01:33:48,203
Nobody flies me ever again except...

1123
01:33:48,303 --> 01:33:50,306
if I want it and only if I want it.

1124
01:33:50,406 --> 01:33:54,070
I've quitted that too.
The booze, the pill, the grass...

1125
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:55,853
the fifty dollar an hour analyst...

1126
01:33:55,953 --> 01:33:58,817
I am through with the whole
mind-fucking scene.

1127
01:33:58,917 --> 01:34:01,387
Everybody's taking something or
they'll never make it till morning.

1128
01:34:01,487 --> 01:34:02,947
Well, I am into group therapy.

1129
01:34:03,047 --> 01:34:04,945
It is very in.

1130
01:34:05,045 --> 01:34:07,747
Oh, yeah, yeah... Is that where
you all sit around in a circle...

1131
01:34:07,847 --> 01:34:09,585
and peak each other apart?

1132
01:34:09,685 --> 01:34:11,761
No. It's where you find out
the mess you're in.

1133
01:34:11,861 --> 01:34:13,398
How you got into it...

1134
01:34:13,498 --> 01:34:15,322
and maybe, how to get out of it.

1135
01:34:15,422 --> 01:34:18,874
Oh, we all hurt someplace and
we're all looking for a painkiller.

1136
01:34:18,974 --> 01:34:22,373
Well... to the painkillers.

1137
01:35:15,717 --> 01:35:17,717
Hello? Theresa.

1138
01:35:19,085 --> 01:35:20,732
Hello? Is this 777-4490?

1139
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:22,832
Yes, James.

1140
01:35:22,924 --> 01:35:25,386
You know, I was thinking about us.

1141
01:35:25,486 --> 01:35:27,781
- Am I interrupting you?
- No.

1142
01:35:28,553 --> 01:35:30,654
I just got home church.

1143
01:35:30,725 --> 01:35:34,975
You know, whenever I've a problem
I go to church...

1144
01:35:39,716 --> 01:35:41,707
So I found myself with this
out-of-towner, here for...

1145
01:35:41,807 --> 01:35:44,537
I don't know, a furniture convention
or something, anyway...

1146
01:35:44,637 --> 01:35:47,523
He won't come to my place and
we won't go to his fancy hotel.

1147
01:35:47,623 --> 01:35:52,824
It's gotta be, for Christ sake's,
a motel, and only this kind of motel.

1148
01:35:52,924 --> 01:35:55,304
First thing, on with the TV.

1149
01:35:55,596 --> 01:35:57,155
Next... Nothing.

1150
01:35:57,255 --> 01:36:00,522
Just sits there on the bed,
watching the porno movie.

1151
01:36:00,622 --> 01:36:04,290
Honest to God, I expect he's gonna
bring out a bag of pop corn.

1152
01:36:04,390 --> 01:36:06,770
So, finally, the big moment.

1153
01:36:07,399 --> 01:36:09,737
He doesn't even take off his pants.

1154
01:36:09,837 --> 01:36:12,072
And all the time he's doing it to me...

1155
01:36:12,172 --> 01:36:14,832
he's watching them do it on TV.

1156
01:36:14,932 --> 01:36:18,714
Is this hysterical, right?
No, wait, wait, wait...

1157
01:36:18,814 --> 01:36:20,470
When I come out again...

1158
01:36:20,570 --> 01:36:23,098
Scarlett and Butcher are still
cranking it out on TV...

1159
01:36:23,198 --> 01:36:27,193
and my furniture freak
is gone with the wind.

1160
01:36:27,935 --> 01:36:31,250
He left this: 'Honey, you're terrific'.

1161
01:36:31,927 --> 01:36:33,927
And this.

1162
01:36:35,833 --> 01:36:37,833
Wild?

1163
01:36:37,921 --> 01:36:41,066
Anyhow, this night I met with this...

1164
01:36:41,616 --> 01:36:43,913
detective, and we end up in my place...

1165
01:36:44,013 --> 01:36:49,283
we smoke a little, laugh a little,
you know, real nice time.

1166
01:36:49,286 --> 01:36:50,763
I come out of the bathroom, and...

1167
01:36:50,863 --> 01:36:53,664
guess what? Away.

1168
01:36:54,633 --> 01:36:56,633
- Not again.
- Right.

1169
01:36:56,702 --> 01:37:00,075
Dick Tracy disappeared with my
20 dollars. Talk about amateur...

1170
01:37:00,175 --> 01:37:06,210
played for a hooker by a square
and ripped off as a sucker by a dick.

1171
01:38:21,376 --> 01:38:23,939
Me, queer? Jesus, I'm a married man.

1172
01:38:24,039 --> 01:38:26,970
I got two kids and
a very expensive mistress.

1173
01:38:27,070 --> 01:38:29,741
- I'm an animal.
- That's why you go to gay bars.

1174
01:38:29,841 --> 01:38:31,531
Two kids.

1175
01:38:31,631 --> 01:38:33,865
- Jesus. Who's that?
- Me, when I need a fix.

1176
01:38:33,965 --> 01:38:35,491
What the hell. You're a juicer?

1177
01:38:35,591 --> 01:38:37,026
I'm a junkie.

1178
01:38:37,126 --> 01:38:39,571
- Yeah? What are you hooked on?
- Anything I can get.

1179
01:38:39,671 --> 01:38:41,700
You got something to drink?

1180
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:44,860
- Something sweet?
- How about me?

1181
01:38:49,993 --> 01:38:55,263
I'm not complaining, but, you know,
you're not very big.

1182
01:38:56,149 --> 01:38:58,149
Neither are you.

1183
01:38:58,187 --> 01:39:00,687
- Coming up, up, up.
- Oh, yeah.

1184
01:39:26,069 --> 01:39:27,562
Jesus.

1185
01:39:27,662 --> 01:39:33,017
My God... I knew it. I knew it.
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.

1186
01:39:36,668 --> 01:39:38,226
- Who the hell are you?
- Who? Me?

1187
01:39:38,326 --> 01:39:39,805
- Yeah, you.
- Me?

1188
01:39:39,905 --> 01:39:43,135
- Yeah, you. Are you a deaf faggot?
- Me?

1189
01:39:43,547 --> 01:39:45,547
Go on, get outta here.

1190
01:39:55,630 --> 01:39:57,630
Hello.

1191
01:39:57,729 --> 01:39:59,777
- You live up there, mama?
- Theresa?

1192
01:39:59,877 --> 01:40:03,872
- Theresa, are you alright?
- She's taking a dump.

1193
01:40:08,878 --> 01:40:12,873
Before you start, I forgive you.
So relax, okay?

1194
01:40:13,051 --> 01:40:15,051
So, how've you been?

1195
01:40:15,590 --> 01:40:17,590
You missed me?

1196
01:40:25,407 --> 01:40:27,407
Why so silent, babe?

1197
01:40:31,063 --> 01:40:34,633
Bette Davis on a little oldie show, right?

1198
01:40:36,414 --> 01:40:40,095
You know, you oughtta get into
one of'em TV game shows.

1199
01:40:40,195 --> 01:40:42,195
Come on down, Terry.

1200
01:40:46,364 --> 01:40:48,236
You'd scream and jump up and down.

1201
01:40:48,336 --> 01:40:51,589
You'd win twenty five grand.
A car and hundred suitcases...

1202
01:40:51,689 --> 01:40:53,752
and a trip to the Honolulu Hilton.

1203
01:40:53,852 --> 01:40:56,572
Hula-hula. Hallelujah. Oh, Lord.

1204
01:40:57,589 --> 01:41:00,649
What the hell is this? Caller house?

1205
01:41:03,377 --> 01:41:06,017
Well, maybe she don't wanna talk to you.

1206
01:41:06,117 --> 01:41:08,624
- What the fuck kinda language is that?
- Give me that.

1207
01:41:08,724 --> 01:41:10,452
Katherine?

1208
01:41:10,552 --> 01:41:12,677
No... No, no problem.

1209
01:41:13,544 --> 01:41:15,544
I'll call you back.

1210
01:41:15,548 --> 01:41:17,065
- You wanna know where I've been?
- No.

1211
01:41:17,165 --> 01:41:18,834
Miami.

1212
01:41:18,934 --> 01:41:20,187
Lost a bundle at the track...

1213
01:41:20,287 --> 01:41:23,576
Been strutting around a fat jew broad
till her little man showed up.

1214
01:41:23,676 --> 01:41:25,876
Miami. Tough asshole.

1215
01:41:26,961 --> 01:41:28,634
Scrounge my way back up here.

1216
01:41:28,734 --> 01:41:31,588
They cut off my welfare, which
I'm told by some nigger clerk.

1217
01:41:31,688 --> 01:41:33,314
Give me a beer, will you, hon?

1218
01:41:33,414 --> 01:41:35,575
So, I need a bed till I get something going.

1219
01:41:35,675 --> 01:41:37,110
Not here.

1220
01:41:37,210 --> 01:41:39,011
What, four or five days.

1221
01:41:39,111 --> 01:41:41,636
- Even you got a mother.
- She said no.

1222
01:41:41,736 --> 01:41:43,861
Go set the world on fire.

1223
01:41:45,689 --> 01:41:47,534
What, on a couple of lousy dollars?

1224
01:41:47,634 --> 01:41:49,634
Find a smaller world.

1225
01:41:49,659 --> 01:41:53,517
Hey, hey, relax, come on.
It's Tony you're talking. Remember?

1226
01:41:53,617 --> 01:41:56,932
You're still my girl.
Mine, mine, right?

1227
01:41:59,618 --> 01:42:01,635
Get this into one of your two heads.

1228
01:42:01,735 --> 01:42:04,619
The only one that can think.
I am my own girl.

1229
01:42:04,719 --> 01:42:06,499
I belong to me. Now, get out of here.

1230
01:42:06,599 --> 01:42:08,800
Leave. Go. Go.

1231
01:42:09,954 --> 01:42:11,427
- I don't believe it.
- Believe it.

1232
01:42:11,527 --> 01:42:13,992
- You're throwing me out?
- Yes.

1233
01:42:14,944 --> 01:42:19,619
You and my mother...
The two biggest cunts in the world.

1234
01:42:38,028 --> 01:42:40,028
Theresa.

1235
01:42:40,488 --> 01:42:42,488
You. Son of a... bitch.

1236
01:42:46,851 --> 01:42:48,851
Theresa?

1237
01:42:49,152 --> 01:42:51,152
Theresa.

1238
01:42:57,191 --> 01:42:59,592
Oh, my God.

1239
01:42:59,788 --> 01:43:03,018
- I'm... fine...
- What did he do to you?

1240
01:43:03,562 --> 01:43:05,772
Come here. Come, sit down.

1241
01:43:06,121 --> 01:43:08,539
- Oh, Jesus.
- My teeth... my teeth...

1242
01:43:08,639 --> 01:43:12,464
Let me look at... Oh, my God.
I'll get some ice.

1243
01:43:13,993 --> 01:43:16,545
How did that creep get in here?
What happened?

1244
01:43:16,645 --> 01:43:18,334
It doesn't matter what happened.

1245
01:43:18,434 --> 01:43:20,585
Let the cops get their hands on
that mother grabber.

1246
01:43:20,685 --> 01:43:24,051
That's it. He's only trying
to hurt his mother.

1247
01:43:24,151 --> 01:43:27,587
What are you talking about?
What do you have to do with his mother?

1248
01:43:27,687 --> 01:43:30,067
Well, we're both...

1249
01:43:31,024 --> 01:43:32,976
- It's cold.
- Just hold it, hold it.

1250
01:43:33,076 --> 01:43:35,076
We're both cunts.

1251
01:43:51,955 --> 01:43:56,205
Oh, God. The cockroaches are
taking over the world.

1252
01:45:02,891 --> 01:45:04,283
Give me that coat.

1253
01:45:04,383 --> 01:45:06,050
- Tony. Tony, no...
- Ole. Ole.

1254
01:45:06,150 --> 01:45:08,133
I'm... Don't do that. Give me that...

1255
01:45:08,233 --> 01:45:09,307
This is not funny.

1256
01:45:09,407 --> 01:45:11,381
Oh, I don't know... It's gonna
cost you 300 now, instead of two.

1257
01:45:11,481 --> 01:45:13,315
- First, I haven't got it.
- You get it.

1258
01:45:13,415 --> 01:45:15,238
- Second, I wouldn't give it to you.
- You wanna bet?

1259
01:45:15,338 --> 01:45:17,199
Not three hundred, not three nothing.

1260
01:45:17,299 --> 01:45:19,765
Oh, well, I'd hate to see it
in the newspapers, you know.

1261
01:45:19,865 --> 01:45:22,265
Virgin schoolteacher, bar hopping slut.

1262
01:45:22,365 --> 01:45:24,975
Pill popper, coke head, doobee-doo.

1263
01:45:25,075 --> 01:45:27,075
All right, Miss Dunn.

1264
01:45:27,959 --> 01:45:33,824
Oh, you don't need Tony anymore.
You got yourself a nigger stud, here.

1265
01:45:53,843 --> 01:45:55,133
Hello?

1266
01:45:55,233 --> 01:45:57,868
- You asked for it, bitch.
- Tony?

1267
01:46:49,036 --> 01:46:51,036
- Found it.
- Found it.

1268
01:47:04,559 --> 01:47:09,344
Telephone tip, from a mysterious
informer, led to a secret life...

1269
01:47:09,444 --> 01:47:11,561
of drugs, bar hopping and sorted sex.

1270
01:47:11,661 --> 01:47:15,061
Ms. Dunn was fired, when she admitted...

1271
01:47:47,894 --> 01:47:49,894
You are really sick.

1272
01:47:51,281 --> 01:47:53,281
Oh, shit...

1273
01:47:56,571 --> 01:47:58,696
Weren't you ever in love?

1274
01:48:01,633 --> 01:48:04,863
That is even more unbearable than you.

1275
01:48:06,891 --> 01:48:08,891
Quit, will ya?

1276
01:48:10,335 --> 01:48:12,335
Will you please quit?

1277
01:48:12,874 --> 01:48:15,974
- Merry Christmas.
- Oh, no...

1278
01:48:19,644 --> 01:48:21,644
What is it? Geez.

1279
01:48:23,499 --> 01:48:25,499
This is fantastic.

1280
01:48:26,827 --> 01:48:28,852
- What made you think of this?
- You.

1281
01:48:28,952 --> 01:48:32,600
Light and dark, on and off,
Now I see you, now I don't.

1282
01:48:32,700 --> 01:48:36,900
To all the lonely people,
on Christmas Eve?

1283
01:48:37,449 --> 01:48:39,449
With love.

1284
01:48:40,216 --> 01:48:43,616
Oh, no... I... I don't want that ring.

1285
01:48:45,446 --> 01:48:48,332
I don... I don't wanna be in love,
not the way you mean.

1286
01:48:48,432 --> 01:48:50,198
You wanna be married,
I don't wanna be married.

1287
01:48:50,298 --> 01:48:53,798
- You wanna have kids, I don't want kids.
- Who said anything about marriage?

1288
01:48:53,898 --> 01:48:57,507
It's Christmas.
Christmas makes me feel good.

1289
01:48:57,607 --> 01:48:59,639
At the end of the year,
you think about the future.

1290
01:48:59,739 --> 01:49:02,289
I don't believe in the future.

1291
01:49:03,247 --> 01:49:05,247
What do you believe in?

1292
01:49:07,497 --> 01:49:09,391
Now. What happens now.

1293
01:49:09,491 --> 01:49:12,798
- That's what I believe in.
- What have you got now? This place?

1294
01:49:12,898 --> 01:49:14,450
- Yeah...
- Look at it.

1295
01:49:14,550 --> 01:49:18,595
What's here when you come home?
Anything that means anything to you?

1296
01:49:18,695 --> 01:49:20,895
Family? A dog? A cat?

1297
01:49:21,163 --> 01:49:23,772
Friends? You have one woman friend
you can talk to?

1298
01:49:23,872 --> 01:49:26,378
Last election, did you even fucking vote?

1299
01:49:26,478 --> 01:49:28,764
You got one thing. Me.

1300
01:49:28,864 --> 01:49:31,496
That's what you've got. And
to hold on to me. It's got to be me.

1301
01:49:31,596 --> 01:49:33,596
And only me.

1302
01:49:33,723 --> 01:49:35,174
- Where are you going?
- Out.

1303
01:49:35,274 --> 01:49:37,274
- Away from you.
- Where?

1304
01:49:51,895 --> 01:49:53,895
Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.

1305
01:50:01,299 --> 01:50:03,834
I don't want your Merry Christmas.

1306
01:50:03,934 --> 01:50:07,063
I don't want the Saint Judas kiss
you give to James.

1307
01:50:07,163 --> 01:50:09,133
Not man enough for you, was he?

1308
01:50:09,233 --> 01:50:12,718
Not man enough for our
kinky Miss America.

1309
01:50:13,126 --> 01:50:17,100
I don't understand you.
I don't understand your crazy world.

1310
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:19,203
I don't understand your crazy talk.

1311
01:50:19,303 --> 01:50:21,938
Freedom this. And freedom that.

1312
01:50:23,521 --> 01:50:25,628
Free to leave your family?

1313
01:50:25,728 --> 01:50:27,768
Free to quit the church?

1314
01:50:28,440 --> 01:50:31,755
Free love? Free to abort your own kids.

1315
01:50:33,323 --> 01:50:35,323
Free to go to hell.

1316
01:50:36,523 --> 01:50:38,774
Will you tell me,
for the love of Christ...

1317
01:50:38,874 --> 01:50:42,145
how can you give no life
to them deaf kids?

1318
01:50:42,245 --> 01:50:44,880
Teach'em, love'em, care for'em?

1319
01:50:45,231 --> 01:50:47,304
When you won't give birth
to your own? Why?

1320
01:50:47,404 --> 01:50:48,559
You know why.

1321
01:50:48,659 --> 01:50:49,890
- You're afraid.
- Yes.

1322
01:50:49,990 --> 01:50:53,560
- Of what? Of labor pain?
- Scoliosis, Poppa.

1323
01:50:53,802 --> 01:50:56,582
You know about scoliosis, don't you?

1324
01:50:56,682 --> 01:50:58,949
Curvature of the spine? A crooked back?

1325
01:50:59,049 --> 01:51:00,531
Paralitic scoliosis?

1326
01:51:00,631 --> 01:51:03,932
Inflammatory, myopathic and
ocular scoliosis?

1327
01:51:04,032 --> 01:51:07,234
The kind you get from rickets
and reumatism and my kind.

1328
01:51:07,334 --> 01:51:09,823
- Congenital. The kind you're born with.
- You got polio.

1329
01:51:09,923 --> 01:51:11,597
- Never.
- Ask the hospital.

1330
01:51:11,697 --> 01:51:14,536
- I did. Congenital. In the blood.
- Polio.

1331
01:51:14,636 --> 01:51:16,761
- Your blood, Poppa.
- Liar.

1332
01:51:17,046 --> 01:51:18,746
- Katherine's clean.
- Lucky.

1333
01:51:18,846 --> 01:51:20,601
- Brigid's clean.
- Lucky.

1334
01:51:20,701 --> 01:51:23,348
- The healthy kids...
- Suppose mine are not healthy.

1335
01:51:23,448 --> 01:51:26,526
My mother had four. All...

1336
01:51:26,626 --> 01:51:28,626
boys.

1337
01:51:30,738 --> 01:51:32,738
All perfect.

1338
01:51:42,075 --> 01:51:44,075
All but one.

1339
01:51:50,319 --> 01:51:52,319
Little Maureen.

1340
01:51:58,461 --> 01:52:02,796
More love in that poor...
twisted little body than...

1341
01:52:07,076 --> 01:52:09,371
in her perfect brothers.

1342
01:52:11,341 --> 01:52:14,040
False as sounding brass.

1343
01:52:15,467 --> 01:52:17,468
Ashamed of her.

1344
01:52:26,099 --> 01:52:28,099
She took her own life.

1345
01:52:35,304 --> 01:52:37,304
Freedom.

1346
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:42,760
Tell me, girl, how do you get free
of the terrible truth?

1347
01:52:48,568 --> 01:52:51,059
Happy New Year from
Times Square in New York.

1348
01:52:51,159 --> 01:52:53,199
It's good-bye to 1976...

1349
01:52:54,390 --> 01:52:56,390
and hello '77.

1350
01:52:56,532 --> 01:52:58,190
- Who is it?
- Telegram.

1351
01:52:58,290 --> 01:53:00,290
Telegram?

1352
01:53:03,598 --> 01:53:06,605
- Your thing is glib.
- That's the story of my life.

1353
01:53:06,705 --> 01:53:08,459
Happy New Year.

1354
01:53:08,559 --> 01:53:12,724
- Meet Robert, 'The Mad Mugger'.
- Mad, Robert, mad.

1355
01:53:12,814 --> 01:53:14,938
Mascarade party. Do you wanna come?

1356
01:53:15,038 --> 01:53:16,528
- No.
- You sure?

1357
01:53:16,628 --> 01:53:17,794
Yeah...

1358
01:53:17,894 --> 01:53:20,851
Whatever you do,
you shouldn't be alone. I mean...

1359
01:53:20,951 --> 01:53:24,436
Nobody oughtta be alone
on New Year's Eve.

1360
01:53:25,859 --> 01:53:28,059
- Be happy, baby.
- Okay...

1361
01:54:08,416 --> 01:54:10,663
Hey. What the hell is the idea?

1362
01:54:10,763 --> 01:54:12,763
Open up.

1363
01:54:14,557 --> 01:54:17,085
Open up, bitch. I know you're in there.

1364
01:54:17,185 --> 01:54:19,185
Hey, Sonia Bologna.

1365
01:54:19,417 --> 01:54:21,149
Pretty night tonight, right?

1366
01:54:21,249 --> 01:54:25,993
You and me, we'll drink out the old
year and blow in the new one, okay?

1367
01:54:26,093 --> 01:54:28,445
Quieres tomar una copa?
[Do you want to have a drink? ]

1368
01:54:28,545 --> 01:54:31,629
Hey, come on, honey, come on.
You got me all worked up.

1369
01:54:31,729 --> 01:54:33,580
Oh. Too late...

1370
01:54:33,680 --> 01:54:35,975
Come on, come on, hurry up.

1371
01:54:38,811 --> 01:54:44,506
Look, you think this lousy toilette
chain is gonna keep me out?

1372
01:54:47,294 --> 01:54:48,755
Operator?

1373
01:54:48,855 --> 01:54:50,603
Get me the police.

1374
01:54:50,703 --> 01:54:52,913
Yes. This is an emergency.

1375
01:54:54,481 --> 01:54:56,481
That does it, coño.

1376
01:54:56,859 --> 01:55:00,059
Finito. You are dead.

1377
01:55:51,754 --> 01:55:53,754
Hey... no tits.

1378
01:56:48,596 --> 01:56:50,596
- Did they hurt you?
- No.

1379
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:52,994
Don't you ever ask me to wear this...

1380
01:56:53,094 --> 01:56:56,239
this crap again. Never. You hear?

1381
01:56:57,820 --> 01:57:01,027
I'm not goddam girl,
you oughtta know that.

1382
01:57:01,127 --> 01:57:02,722
Christ. Look at us.

1383
01:57:02,822 --> 01:57:05,077
You know what we are? Look at us.

1384
01:57:05,177 --> 01:57:07,190
We're a couple of freaks.

1385
01:57:07,290 --> 01:57:09,790
- We're freaks.
- I'm sorry...

1386
01:57:09,990 --> 01:57:11,990
Sorry... Shit.

1387
01:57:12,268 --> 01:57:14,059
I had it with you.

1388
01:57:14,159 --> 01:57:16,858
The fancy pad, the shirts, the shoes...

1389
01:57:16,958 --> 01:57:18,998
I'm cutting out of here.

1390
01:57:19,075 --> 01:57:21,075
Don't go...

1391
01:57:21,339 --> 01:57:23,339
Please, don't go.

1392
01:57:24,742 --> 01:57:26,742
Please, don't go.

1393
01:57:29,604 --> 01:57:32,862
- Where are you gonna go?
- Anywhere away from you.

1394
01:57:32,962 --> 01:57:34,781
Will you be back?

1395
01:57:34,881 --> 01:57:36,881
I don't know...

1396
01:57:37,223 --> 01:57:40,198
I'll wait for you at the apartment.

1397
01:57:40,587 --> 01:57:42,238
You'll need some money.

1398
01:57:42,338 --> 01:57:44,837
- Shove it.
- I'll wait for you.

1399
01:57:45,614 --> 01:57:49,012
Right, well you then do it, not me.
I'm a pitcher, not a catcher.

1400
01:57:49,112 --> 01:57:52,087
And don't you ever forget, ya hear?

1401
01:58:02,996 --> 01:58:06,043
This is it. The last night cruising bars.

1402
01:58:06,143 --> 01:58:07,542
Something serious?

1403
01:58:07,642 --> 01:58:10,445
Well, when your night life
interferes with your day life...

1404
01:58:10,545 --> 01:58:12,086
Can I buy you a drink?

1405
01:58:12,186 --> 01:58:13,823
Not even one for luck?

1406
01:58:13,923 --> 01:58:15,338
Confidentially, with me?

1407
01:58:15,438 --> 01:58:18,653
One's too many and a million's not enough.

1408
01:58:18,753 --> 01:58:21,473
I got the same problem with men.

1409
01:58:57,387 --> 01:58:59,256
Nice way to fly.

1410
01:58:59,356 --> 01:59:02,247
They say it prolongues sex
almost indefinitely.

1411
01:59:02,347 --> 01:59:04,846
It makes me absolutely wild.

1412
01:59:06,039 --> 01:59:08,039
Hi, I'm Arthur.

1413
01:59:10,281 --> 01:59:12,281
Where did you do that?

1414
01:59:12,467 --> 01:59:14,467
That must really...

1415
01:59:16,172 --> 01:59:18,134
You think I'm queer, don't you?

1416
01:59:18,234 --> 01:59:20,534
Please, I... I never said...

1417
01:59:20,666 --> 01:59:22,666
No, but you thought it.

1418
01:59:22,782 --> 01:59:24,782
Didn't you?

1419
01:59:25,575 --> 01:59:27,575
I'm sorry... I'm sorry.

1420
01:59:29,168 --> 01:59:31,168
Freak.

1421
02:00:00,285 --> 02:00:02,053
Excuse me, could we talk together...

1422
02:00:02,153 --> 02:00:03,708
for a moment? Just a moment.

1423
02:00:03,808 --> 02:00:06,085
There's a guy back there that
won't let me alone.

1424
02:00:06,185 --> 02:00:08,185
Probably watching us.

1425
02:00:12,663 --> 02:00:15,463
- That one?
- Yeah.

1426
02:00:16,644 --> 02:00:18,944
- Seems okay.
- Kinda scary.

1427
02:00:19,567 --> 02:00:21,368
Why'd you pick me?

1428
02:00:21,468 --> 02:00:24,373
- You seem...
- What?

1429
02:00:25,429 --> 02:00:27,324
I don't know. Friendly.

1430
02:00:27,424 --> 02:00:29,424
You got a nice smile.

1431
02:00:30,129 --> 02:00:32,934
If you smile maybe he'll go away.

1432
02:00:34,766 --> 02:00:36,766
Then what?

1433
02:00:37,721 --> 02:00:39,622
Midnight in San Francisco.

1434
02:00:39,722 --> 02:00:41,722
Happy New Year.

1435
02:00:44,475 --> 02:00:46,475
Happy New Year.

1436
02:01:00,724 --> 02:01:04,124
- Thanks for seeing me home.
- I knew it...

1437
02:01:04,554 --> 02:01:08,054
I knew it... Yes, indeed.

1438
02:01:08,436 --> 02:01:10,436
Home, sweet home.

1439
02:01:10,902 --> 02:01:12,402
Hey...

1440
02:01:12,502 --> 02:01:14,712
You need a drink real bad.

1441
02:01:16,178 --> 02:01:19,391
Room Service? Sir, bring us up
a bottle of 'Wild Turkey'?

1442
02:01:19,491 --> 02:01:21,871
And make it fast. Thank you.

1443
02:01:23,009 --> 02:01:25,409
It's nice... real nice.

1444
02:01:26,266 --> 02:01:27,720
Before you move in?

1445
02:01:27,820 --> 02:01:31,446
One drink, okay? One?
Then good night? Okay?

1446
02:01:31,546 --> 02:01:35,201
Say, that... friend in the bar,
bugging you?

1447
02:01:37,661 --> 02:01:39,761
I got the same problem.

1448
02:01:39,824 --> 02:01:41,864
Regular leech, you know?

1449
02:01:42,134 --> 02:01:44,431
All the time, crying and spying...

1450
02:01:44,531 --> 02:01:47,081
hanging on... Won't let go.

1451
02:01:48,438 --> 02:01:51,158
Day and night. Love me. Love me.

1452
02:01:51,359 --> 02:01:56,156
I can't even go to the can without
'what you doing, honey?'

1453
02:01:56,256 --> 02:01:58,256
Love...

1454
02:01:58,364 --> 02:02:01,302
Shit. You know, I practically OD'ed on love.

1455
02:02:01,402 --> 02:02:04,706
Wasted, you know? I'd like
to black out for a week.

1456
02:02:04,806 --> 02:02:06,461
How long you married?

1457
02:02:06,561 --> 02:02:09,562
What the hell kinda crack is that?
I hate...

1458
02:02:09,662 --> 02:02:12,127
I actually hate this... person.

1459
02:02:13,485 --> 02:02:15,877
I have to be crazy to go back there tonight.

1460
02:02:15,977 --> 02:02:18,527
Been a crazy night. All night.

1461
02:02:19,565 --> 02:02:24,240
When I got into town, broke,
no job, no place to stay...

1462
02:02:24,342 --> 02:02:25,831
all I'm looking for is...

1463
02:02:25,931 --> 02:02:29,476
get out of the cold, a place
to flop for the night, right?

1464
02:02:29,576 --> 02:02:31,845
Well... we boozed it up pretty good.

1465
02:02:31,945 --> 02:02:34,446
You know, one thing or another...

1466
02:02:34,546 --> 02:02:37,951
Anyhow, we've been shagged up
ever since.

1467
02:02:38,962 --> 02:02:40,962
Sometimes...

1468
02:02:43,508 --> 02:02:48,247
Sometimes I think, honest to God,
I was better off in prison.

1469
02:02:48,347 --> 02:02:50,557
Were you really in prison?

1470
02:02:50,775 --> 02:02:52,775
Yes, ma'am. Twice.

1471
02:02:52,892 --> 02:02:54,892
What for?

1472
02:02:55,364 --> 02:02:56,822
This and that.

1473
02:02:56,922 --> 02:03:00,887
Don't people hold it against you?
Being a convict?

1474
02:03:00,987 --> 02:03:04,686
Oh, yes, ma'am. They certainly do.

1475
02:03:07,029 --> 02:03:10,429
- Not you, though. You're different.
- Yeah.

1476
02:03:10,874 --> 02:03:13,437
Well, a con gets to know things.

1477
02:03:13,537 --> 02:03:16,837
Who cares, who don't. And you...

1478
02:03:17,790 --> 02:03:21,870
you really care.
Not a mean bone in your body.

1479
02:03:22,888 --> 02:03:25,268
Oh, you're a con man, right.

1480
02:03:31,284 --> 02:03:34,004
I thought you were wasted.

1481
02:03:35,215 --> 02:03:36,845
Wait.

1482
02:03:36,945 --> 02:03:38,945
Wait, wait...

1483
02:03:39,043 --> 02:03:41,253
First, I'd better... yeah.

1484
02:04:18,627 --> 02:04:20,627
What you got here?

1485
02:04:52,530 --> 02:04:54,995
We all carry scars someplace.

1486
02:04:55,389 --> 02:04:58,024
They say we're all born in sin.

1487
02:04:59,821 --> 02:05:01,821
Well, lucky thing?

1488
02:05:05,266 --> 02:05:07,267
Now. Okay, now...

1489
02:05:14,150 --> 02:05:17,125
You have a... very nice body...

1490
02:05:18,370 --> 02:05:20,920
I admire people keeping shape.

1491
02:05:23,108 --> 02:05:25,148
I work out all the time.

1492
02:05:34,408 --> 02:05:36,408
In my neighborhood...

1493
02:05:37,235 --> 02:05:39,640
if you didn't fight, you were fruit.

1494
02:05:39,740 --> 02:05:41,274
In prison...

1495
02:05:41,374 --> 02:05:45,029
if you didn't fight,
you were spared ass.

1496
02:05:57,958 --> 02:06:00,205
I shouldn't have drunk so much.

1497
02:06:00,305 --> 02:06:02,305
Hey... hey...

1498
02:06:03,162 --> 02:06:05,162
I'm not ready.

1499
02:06:05,782 --> 02:06:07,782
Damn it. I'm not ready.

1500
02:06:08,051 --> 02:06:10,091
M-maybe-maybe it's me...

1501
02:06:10,684 --> 02:06:14,934
Whatever, it's not your fault.
It happens.

1502
02:06:15,875 --> 02:06:17,875
Goddamn women.

1503
02:06:17,971 --> 02:06:22,035
All you got to do is lay there,
a guy's got to do all the work.

1504
02:06:22,135 --> 02:06:24,135
You think that's funny?

1505
02:06:27,152 --> 02:06:30,278
I think of the odd way to start the new year.

1506
02:06:30,378 --> 02:06:32,401
What's the hurry? We got all night.

1507
02:06:32,501 --> 02:06:34,044
No. Some other time.

1508
02:06:34,144 --> 02:06:36,524
I'll call a cab to... Hey...

1509
02:06:37,629 --> 02:06:40,699
Listen, don't go to sleep, está bem?
Hein? Come on...

1510
02:06:40,799 --> 02:06:42,839
Will you please get out? You can't...
You can't stay here...

1511
02:06:42,939 --> 02:06:44,781
If you wanna get laid, okay, later.

1512
02:06:44,881 --> 02:06:47,061
- I want you out of here. Now.
- No.

1513
02:06:47,161 --> 02:06:49,108
What... What are you trying to prove?

1514
02:06:49,208 --> 02:06:52,277
Prove? Prove what?
I don't need to prove nothing to you.

1515
02:06:52,377 --> 02:06:54,643
You think I'm somekind of a flamin' faggot.

1516
02:06:54,743 --> 02:06:57,071
Goddammit. I'm married to a girl that
makes you look like shit.

1517
02:06:57,171 --> 02:07:00,266
She's down in Florida, with a belly
up to here with my kid.

1518
02:07:00,366 --> 02:07:02,366
Mine.

1519
02:07:02,654 --> 02:07:06,224
How's that for a proof?
You, candle fucker.

1520
02:07:09,128 --> 02:07:11,328
Katherine. Katherine.

1521
02:07:48,847 --> 02:07:50,847
Shut up.

1522
02:08:35,484 --> 02:08:37,249
I'm ready now.

1523
02:08:37,349 --> 02:08:39,559
You want it, right, bitch?

1524
02:08:45,363 --> 02:08:48,348
That's what you wanted, right?
That's what you wanted, right?

1525
02:08:48,448 --> 02:08:52,273
- That's what you wanted, right?
- Do it. Do it.

1526
02:08:58,612 --> 02:09:00,612
Bitch.

1527
02:09:00,981 --> 02:09:02,981
Oh, God.

1528
02:09:04,335 --> 02:09:06,335
Right?

1529
02:09:12,819 --> 02:09:14,819
Right?
