1
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:50,274
(woman) You don't know
where you're going.

2
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,217
Yes, I do.

3
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:57,620
- You don't know where you are.
- Yes, I do. I'm in hell.

4
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,923
Just get in the car.
You cannot walk the entire way to...

5
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:07,158
- This was your choice.
- This was not my choice, Mom.

6
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:11,761
What, to live with some old bitch
that you can't even stand that I don't even know?

7
00:01:11,838 --> 00:01:14,602
You wanted me out of your life,
I'm out of your life, Mom.

8
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:17,074
You're impossible. You are impossible.

9
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:19,338
If you weren't such a nutcase,

10
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:22,870
we could have flown here
like normal people and been done with this shit.

11
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:26,407
You won, OK? You won.
I'm out of your life.

12
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:29,546
- No one has won.
- I'm out of your life.

13
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:32,750
Now if you please would just get out of mine.

14
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:35,556
- Go. Get out.
- All right, fine.

15
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:11,997
(truck radio playing)

16
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:35,446
(music stops)

17
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,089
(man) Hello?

18
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,536
- (screams)
- Hey! Whoa!

19
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:03,275
Whoa, whoa! Hey, hey, hey!

20
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:06,011
Who are you?

21
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:08,553
Hey, I didn't mean nothing.
Just calm down.

22
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:12,079
My God, are you one of those
back... country sodomy boys?

23
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,820
I didn't mean any harm.

24
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:18,227
Can you help me up, please?

25
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,296
- Are you crazy?
- No.

26
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,233
I'm Rachel.

27
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:27,000
- Harlan Wilson.
- (dog barks)

28
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:29,837
You got yourself a nice feel there,
didn't you, Harlan Wilson?

29
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:33,242
- Hey, that wasn't my intention.
- What were your intentions?

30
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:36,111
- To see if you were dead.
- (honks horn)

31
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:38,173
(dog barks)

32
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:40,843
Car trouble, Harlan?

33
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:44,547
Hey, I had one of these.
Till I crashed it. Can I drive?

34
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:48,060
- Beg your pardon?
- I found her sleeping by the side of the road.

35
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:50,857
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

36
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,330
- Says her name's Rachel.
- Yeah?

37
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:57,199
If she turns out to be sane...
you know, she's all yours.

38
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,535
- I gotta get back to work.
- Hey.

39
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:04,634
Is for horses. Better for cows.
Pigs don't eat it 'cause they don't know how.

40
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,908
- What's your name?
- Simon.

41
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:08,913
Hmm.

42
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,682
- I wasn't really going anywhere.
- That's where I'm going.

43
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:13,878
- Where?
- Anywhere.

44
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:17,116
- I was going there alone.
- Now you're not. Consider yourself lucky.

45
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,718
- I would if you weren't here.
- Mm. Consider yourself stuck.

46
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,527
(starts engine/drives off)

47
00:04:27,233 --> 00:04:30,964
- (Simon) I don't like to talk.
- (Rachel) Perfect. I don't like to listen.

48
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:36,635
(sighs)

49
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:45,147
- Would you put your legs back in my car?
- Changing the rules?

50
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:49,678
There were no rules.
Other than no parts of your body outside my car.

51
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:52,782
- Well, then, can I talk to you?
- Put your legs down.

52
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:55,794
You didn't say "Simon says," Simon.

53
00:04:58,164 --> 00:05:02,191
- I'm only going as far as Hull.
- Hull, Idaho? That's where I'm staying.

54
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:04,395
My luck.

55
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,837
Now, do you need to call someone,
or are you a surprise?

56
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:13,106
I would. My mother cut my phone service off.
She's a gem.

57
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:50,939
Nuh... uh. Ace is only low.
Not high. Georgia rule.

58
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:54,009
Everybody else plays the right way.
Why can't we?

59
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:59,286
So if everybody took a poop in the middle of Main
Street you'd do it too? 'Cause they said it was right?

60
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,953
- Probably.
- My leg is numb.

61
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,462
Hey, no quitting.

62
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,158
I got pains from my gluteus
shooting up and out my eyes

63
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:10,259
from sitting on the floor
with two boneless children.

64
00:06:10,336 --> 00:06:13,203
Quitting?
Did you hear me say "quitting"?

65
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,135
(dog barking)

66
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:26,982
Rummy.

67
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,578
- Uhh.
- (knock on door)

68
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:33,022
- Mom?
- Wait. No, we can't go. I'm winning.

69
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:37,751
- Hello. You're not Mom.
- Hello.

70
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,264
Lilly. Come on in.

71
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:49,797
- Come on, boys. Erect me.
- She has gluten pains shooting out her eyeballs.

72
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:59,482
Where's Rachel?

73
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:05,548
I thought this drive would be good for us.
That we could talk, at least tolerate each other.

74
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:09,025
Where is my granddaughter?

75
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,427
She bolted from the car.

76
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:19,402
You look really nice, anyway, Lilly.

77
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:22,236
I should have put her on a plane.

78
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,640
- Still smoke?
- No.

79
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:29,947
Did I ask if you still dye your hair? I haven't had
a drink in years, in case you wanted to know.

80
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:33,247
- It's none of my business.
- Yeah? Heh... heh.

81
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:35,378
I brought you a gift.

82
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,424
- Oh, it's lovely.
- How do you know?

83
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:42,621
The ribbon and the paper. How's she gonna
find me? She's only been here once.

84
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:45,721
13 years ago. Same as you.

85
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:50,565
Rachel is very resourceful.
She'll find you when she needs you.

86
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,695
Why are children in your house?

87
00:07:52,772 --> 00:07:57,141
They're my friends. Here, guys.
I watch them till their mom gets home.

88
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,235
This is Sam. This is Ethan.

89
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,179
- Nice to meet you.
- This is my daughter Lilly.

90
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:03,476
Hi.

91
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:10,355
Traveled all the way from San Francisco, California,
smelling of smoke. But she doesn't smoke.

92
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:12,254
OK, Mother, caught me.

93
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,522
Save the lies for something
more important than cancer.

94
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:18,689
Why don't you go get the bags, you two?

95
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:22,894
Oh, um, you know what?
Everything but the Louis Vuittons.

96
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:26,200
They have "LV" written all over 'em.

97
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:32,867
- You travel with luggage you don't use?
- Oh, I'm just staying a minute.

98
00:08:32,945 --> 00:08:37,678
I have friends. They're begging me
to come down to Salt Lake City and visit.

99
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,184
Good friends?

100
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,778
We keep in touch.

101
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,323
Well, it's worth the drive, then.

102
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:50,729
Bringing up the girl's bags.

103
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:53,128
I think they got rocks in 'em.

104
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:59,127
(chirps)

105
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:02,800
Everything's exactly the same,
except for the bird.

106
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:08,641
It's a glass... bedpan?

107
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,979
Heh... heh. Crystal bowl. It's classy.

108
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:16,250
- I thought of one for my mantel.
- Take this one, then.

109
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:18,950
It's a gift, Mother.

110
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,660
It's just there's so much on my mantel.

111
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:26,061
Well, look around,
because I'm not taking it back.

112
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,497
Thank you.

113
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,968
It's lovely. Nice, thanks.

114
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:36,932
- Well, this is Hull.
- Just drop me in town. Nice to know you, Simon.

115
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,671
- You don't know me, kid.
- I know you.

116
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,906
You do?

117
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:45,879
I had my dress hiked and my legs up,
and you didn't look once.

118
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:48,546
Not even for a second.

119
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,816
So now you know me?

120
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:54,792
No marriage ring.
What are you, 30? 40?

121
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,352
You're gay.

122
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:06,838
- All right, get out.
- I already asked you to let me out.

123
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:11,843
- I'm telling you.
- What? You can't tell me what I've already asked.

124
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:14,744
Get out. Just get out.

125
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:21,152
I want my panties back
when you're done with them.

126
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:27,057
Harlan found her sleeping
by the side of the road.

127
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:30,562
- Do you buy that?
- He's a wonderful doctor.

128
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,791
(starts engine)

129
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:51,814
- Thanks for the sandwich.
- You won't make it to your friends' before dark.

130
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:56,184
- That wasn't really my goal.
- Accidents mostly happen at dusk.

131
00:10:56,255 --> 00:11:00,191
- I would guess morning.
- Well, you'd be wrong.

132
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:02,659
All in God's hands.

133
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:05,561
- That's what your father always used to say.
- Uh... huh.

134
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:08,065
Everybody's hands but his own.

135
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:12,127
You never said anything bad about him
when he was alive.

136
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:15,332
Well, if I did, why would I say it to you?

137
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:21,739
Why say anything? Your granddaughter
takes off when she doesn't get her way.

138
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:24,647
She's easy to find, though.
Just listen for a scream.

139
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:30,713
If she doesn't show up in the next few hours,
call me on my cellphone, I'll turn around.

140
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:35,192
Thank you for taking her.

141
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:38,155
I hope it does her some good.

142
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,698
Did it do you any good?

143
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:49,663
(starts engine)

144
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:54,571
(music) Beyond the horizon

145
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,083
(music) Behind the sun

146
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,751
(music) At the end of the rainbow

147
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:07,793
(music) Life has already begun

148
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:14,428
(music) In the long hours of twilight

149
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,264
(music) 'Neath the stardust above

150
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:21,662
(music) Beyond the horizon

151
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,172
(music) It is easy to love

152
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,345
- (sighs)
- (sighs)

153
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:41,553
- Ahem. You don't look evil.
- Makeup helps.

154
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:45,996
- Hmm. Where's my mom?
- Had to see friends.

155
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:47,794
Oh, right.

156
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:53,601
Did you hear the one where she's stopped smoking,
drinking and hating herself, too?

157
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,871
(sighs) Rachel...

158
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,416
I'm hungry.
Got anything with sugar?

159
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:10,887
You're five hours late.

160
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:14,653
My mother dumped me 20 miles out.
I had to walk the whole way.

161
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:17,628
We eat at six. No exceptions.

162
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:20,221
You'll have to wait for breakfast.

163
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,132
Oh, there's apples on the table.

164
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:28,972
Mm. Can I tell you what's really going on?
So we don't get lost in what this really is.

165
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,874
I'd like to know.

166
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:37,115
My mother and stepfather don't like my life.
Maybe because I have one, who knows?

167
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:40,744
Anyway, I was stupid enough
to graduate high school in January.

168
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:46,452
I got into a trouble a few times while I was waiting to
go to college in the fall. So they had to get rid of me.

169
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:49,187
Banished for the summer in Idaho.

170
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:53,163
Locked up with the one person on earth
my mother can't jerk around.

171
00:13:53,232 --> 00:13:55,257
That's why I'm here.

172
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,928
Try and jerk me around, Grandma.

173
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:08,875
Go fuck yourself.

174
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,542
No good night kiss?

175
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:16,946
OK.

176
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,755
(bell dings)

177
00:15:11,777 --> 00:15:15,907
You know, the only picture
I've ever seen of you is with me in it.

178
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:18,677
Holding this dog.

179
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:22,881
I got it for you so you wouldn't be afraid
at your grandfather's funeral.

180
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,185
You named it Grandpa.

181
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:29,421
I was four. Couldn't you have helped me
pick a name that made some sense?

182
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:32,089
It made sense to you.

183
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:36,792
My stepfather promised
to buy me a new car for school.

184
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:40,100
You know, if I can survive up here,
stay sane.

185
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:43,801
Oh. So your time here
won't be a complete waste.

186
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:46,242
Well, I'll miss my friends.

187
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:51,511
Oh, cheer up. Most friends, in time,
become as useless as relatives.

188
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:11,226
So, I brought seven novels. If I read them slowly,
that should kill two of the ten weeks that I'm here.

189
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,539
Oh, my God, what is that?

190
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,572
I don't want you
to take the Lord's name in vain.

191
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:22,102
The f... you lady won't let me say "Oh, my God"?
Got any sugar?

192
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,741
I will not tolerate blasphemy.

193
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:28,379
And the next time,
I want you to sleep upstairs.

194
00:16:28,454 --> 00:16:32,254
- What if I want to take a nap?
- Upstairs. Georgia rule.

195
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,519
God, lady, you are weird.

196
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:38,558
I will wash your mouth out next time.

197
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,865
No wonder Mom hates you.

198
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:49,207
I'm glad you're here, Rachel.

199
00:16:54,213 --> 00:17:00,345
So, do you guys have anything better
around here than Harlan Wilson?

200
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,583
Keep your dress on. I got you a job.

201
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,654
- A what?
- It starts Monday.

202
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:09,751
Just a brisk walk from here.
I'll wake you at seven.

203
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:12,661
- I'm not working.
- One more rule.

204
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:16,724
- You live here, you work.
- OK...

205
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:21,830
I know that you pulled your "Georgia rule" bullshit
with my mother before she fled.

206
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:25,172
But I'm not her.
And you can't tell me what to do.

207
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:27,974
Rachel rule.

208
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,345
Wash your dishes.

209
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,611
Are you asking or telling?

210
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:35,551
You finished, wash your dishes.

211
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,757
I've never really washed a dish before.

212
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:53,597
(music) Oh, I see a sunny sky

213
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,341
(music) Every time I look into...

214
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:01,004
Morning. How are you?
Have you been practicing?

215
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,311
(music)... my friend

216
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:07,580
(music) Stayin' together till the end

217
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:11,953
(music) It's gonna be a lovely day

218
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:13,855
(music) It's gonna be...

219
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:17,157
I don't know if I can afford this one.
It's for Izzy.

220
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:20,596
I'm trying to find something easier on his back.
I saw something...

221
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:25,694
(music) It's gonna be a lovely day

222
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:29,632
Hey.

223
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,970
- Morning.
- Morning.

224
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:37,277
- Morning.
- Morning.

225
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:38,816
(music)... a lovely day

226
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:44,754
(music) It's gonna be a lovely day

227
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:47,951
Surprise.
Saddling up your truck?

228
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:51,962
I had it figured
that you'd done away with Simon,

229
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,864
buried his body and taken off for the city
with his cash and car.

230
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:58,095
And leave you alive?

231
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,938
Just how disturbed are you?

232
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:03,634
I prefer "unique."

233
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:06,678
- How old are you, anyway?
- Old enough.

234
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,170
- Old enough for what?
- To disturb you.

235
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,683
You're a dangerous girl, aren't you?

236
00:19:14,753 --> 00:19:17,119
It depends on what you consider dangerous.

237
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,817
Safer to get thrown from a horse.

238
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:24,955
Well, you don't have to brush or feed me
after riding me.

239
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,021
(bell chiming)

240
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:34,272
- I got a girl.
- (dog barks)

241
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,441
Have a good day, cowboy.

242
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,502
(drums beating)

243
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,846
Fourth of July picnic this Saturday.

244
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,320
Bring the family.

245
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:54,189
- Mandy, stop us.
- Mark time. March.

246
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:57,558
- Who is that?
- I don't know.

247
00:19:57,629 --> 00:20:00,530
Not from around here.
Move us.

248
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:02,692
Forward, march.

249
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:05,066
Fourth of July picnic this Saturday.

250
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:08,163
Music and games.
Petting zoo for the kids.

251
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,676
Pet a cow. Squeeze a pig.
Milk a goat.

252
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:13,734
(dog barks)

253
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:18,644
Hello?

254
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:22,209
Hi. I'm here to tell you
that I won't be working here.

255
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:26,485
Oh, Georgia called me about you.

256
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:30,722
- Well, aren't you a pretty little thing?
- Fern. Fern.

257
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:36,766
I'Il just be a moment, dear.
If you'll stay with the phone...

258
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:43,601
Very good, Violet. We don't want any accidents,
it confuses the animals. Come along.

259
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:47,441
The bathroom's right in here,
you know that, Violet.

260
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:48,877
(man) I'm all right.

261
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,415
No lifting, Izzy.
I'm telling you, I mean it.

262
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:54,577
You're not a weightlifter.
(gibberish)

263
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:56,382
- How do you say?
- (Izzy laughs)

264
00:20:56,455 --> 00:21:00,414
Hearing the Basque language makes me feel better,
especially when I'm in pain.

265
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:05,794
Hear me as your doctor. I'm telling you, no lifting.
No feedbags, no hay bales, no more cows.

266
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:09,459
- I have to lift. I'm Basque.
- You're a Basque with a hernia.

267
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:12,560
- No lifting, not even your own hat.
- All right...

268
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:16,438
Ahem. Hi. I'm the new office girl.

269
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:19,500
You're Lilly's daughter?

270
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:24,948
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I am Istegui Argitalexei Sarronainda.

271
00:21:26,184 --> 00:21:29,119
- But you can call me Izzy.
- Mm.

272
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:31,587
- Better.
- And you?

273
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:34,421
- I'm Rachel. From California.
- Ah...

274
00:21:34,493 --> 00:21:36,620
California...
the land of fruits and nuts.

275
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:38,026
(chuckles)

276
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:41,691
- Signing out.
- I mean it. Let Harlan do your lifting.

277
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:45,993
- You know Harlan?
- Yes. Hardest worker I've ever had.

278
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,266
He lifts like a Basque.

279
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:54,438
You tell Harlan that if he's up for a little danger,
then I'd really love a ride.

280
00:21:58,116 --> 00:21:59,777
OK.

281
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:03,446
I will do that. Nice to meet you, Rachel.
Simon.

282
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,513
- Slowly.
- Slowly, slowly...

283
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:12,796
- You are the anti... Christ.
- (door closes)

284
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:16,960
Violet Seymoure
is in the examination room for you, Doctor.

285
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:19,230
- Isn't she a beauty?
- Well...

286
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:21,272
- Same as Lilly.
- Sure.

287
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,137
Yeah, mm... hmm.

288
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:28,243
- He treats people?
- Unofficially.

289
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:32,977
Oh, this is such a relief,
knowing Simon won't be alone.

290
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:36,714
He's a veterinarian.
It's illegal, what he does.

291
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:39,646
They'd yank his license.

292
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:43,559
- What's that you're reading?
- Oh, just a book of poetry.

293
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:51,128
"The hounds of the crimson sky gave tongue,
but never a cry gave he."

294
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:54,764
- That's Ezra Pound, the poet.
- Born right here in Idaho.

295
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,105
Oh, but you probably
wouldn't know about that.

296
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:01,577
I'll be back the first Tuesday in August.

297
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:04,945
- In August?
- (phone rings)

298
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:15,987
Ethan, Sam, this is Rachel, my...

299
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:19,189
granddaughter.

300
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:22,233
- Do we have to like her?
- How old is she?

301
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,894
No, and forget about it.

302
00:23:25,537 --> 00:23:28,700
I was just asking a question.

303
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:34,503
You could offer us some.

304
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,911
The kids are thirsty, too.

305
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:40,717
Want a sip?

306
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:43,880
I gotta finish here.

307
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:51,121
- How was work?
- I should have his license pulled.

308
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:55,257
We saw a pit bull and a peeing woman
all in the same day.

309
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:02,002
Are you anywhere near ashamed,
making these little boys work like this?

310
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:03,506
- Let me do it.
- No.

311
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,805
- I'm trying to help you.
- I can do it.

312
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:07,811
- Just let me...
- I'll do it.

313
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:10,006
Tell him to let me...

314
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:13,448
- Get him off of me. Brat.
- Hey.

315
00:24:14,352 --> 00:24:16,343
Stop. (whistles)

316
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:19,686
- No fighting.
- Get him off of me. I didn't start it, he did.

317
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:21,658
- You started it.
- Shut up.

318
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:24,695
Punch her, Sam. Pull her hair.

319
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:28,392
- Gather your senses.
- Oh, my God.

320
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,231
Oh, my God. You're hard.

321
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,795
You had ample warning
about the Lord's name.

322
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:39,207
Dude, it was a fight.
You don't pull a boner in a battle.

323
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:44,112
Go back and hit her, Sam.

324
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,147
- In your mouth.
- What?

325
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:54,249
Are you serious? The kid gets stiff on my leg,
and I can't use the Lord's name?

326
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:58,729
- You cannot use the Lord's name...
- She's trying to get me to eat soap.

327
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:03,825
No, give it to someone else. You guys
want some soap? She's giving out free soap.

328
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:05,130
Bye.

329
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:09,498
Ah, she was raised in California.

330
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:20,179
No, no. Honey, honey, don't, no.

331
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:26,248
Fingers are for holding the fork,
the fork is for feeding your mouth. Georgia rule.

332
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:48,275
Happy?

333
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,013
Paula Richards,
Rachel Wilcox my granddaughter.

334
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:58,282
Mm.

335
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:01,917
Georgia's been so excited about your visit.

336
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,954
What now, Grandma?

337
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:08,397
You can take it out.
Grab a chair.

338
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:11,199
Thanks.

339
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:14,739
(Rachel spits and coughs)

340
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:19,567
Hey.

341
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,344
I'm done.
May I be excused?

342
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,077
Yeah.

343
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:31,786
Would you go out and get us some ice cream?
There's money in the jar.

344
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:36,816
- Rachel is working for Simon.
- So I heard. That's great.

345
00:26:36,895 --> 00:26:39,295
So, is he queer, or what?

346
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,200
Simon is Paula's brother.

347
00:26:44,703 --> 00:26:49,299
He lost his wife and son in a car accident
three years ago, and it takes time.

348
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:57,946
For a smart girl, you're good at stupid.

349
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:11,526
- Dog comes up out of nowhere.
- OK. Yeah. Rachel...

350
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:15,727
I would have shot him,
if he hadn't taken a piece of me.

351
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,497
Please, don't shoot a dog.
I'd have to deal with that.

352
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:23,234
You'll be all right soon.
Bring a cushion to the barbecue, though.

353
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:26,800
- The peeing lady's back.
- Every week.

354
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:30,507
My... Georgia wants me to help her out for the
Fourth of July barbecue tomorrow,

355
00:27:30,582 --> 00:27:32,641
so I'm gonna take off.

356
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:36,278
First, there's some gauze in my office.
Will you bring that to me?

357
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:39,721
- Yeah. Sorry.
- That should do.

358
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:41,652
(man) All right.

359
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:49,331
Is it in there? Harold, can you
get that tape started?

360
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:52,564
- I'm having trouble with that.
- I can't find the end of it.

361
00:27:52,637 --> 00:27:56,300
Me, neither. Both of us need glasses.

362
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:58,069
- Find it?
- Yeah.

363
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:02,477
(Harold) I used to have 20... 20.
See anything in the dark.

364
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:05,546
(Harold) Is that gonna scar?

365
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:07,414
(Simon) Uh... yeah.

366
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:09,476
(band plays)

367
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:19,153
(applause)

368
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,221
(band plays new tune)

369
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:28,501
- Peach, cherry or apple?
- Which one would you like, Troy?

370
00:28:28,573 --> 00:28:32,168
- I'll try the peach.
- Yeah!

371
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:34,404
(vendor) Hamburgers, hot dogs!

372
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:37,937
Mrs. Seymoure,
is the music too loud for you?

373
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,712
You wanna move back, over...?
No?

374
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:42,847
(woman) Hi, Bonnie.

375
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:44,912
(man speaks Spanish)

376
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,922
- Nice shot.
- Yeah.

377
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:50,187
(man yells)

378
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:52,252
- See you later, Simon.
- Bye.

379
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,321
She'd be cute for you.

380
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,334
She just likes me
'cause I just neutered her dog.

381
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,836
That's nice.

382
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,270
What about the music teacher?

383
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:06,208
No, she's my landlord.
I can't date my landlord.

384
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:11,381
Georgia sent over a plate
and some pie for you.

385
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:14,714
You didn't alter it?
Poison it?

386
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:21,216
That's Bach. She's playing Bach.
I was expecting some ass... kicking country music.

387
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:24,056
We have our cultural side.

388
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:27,098
Couldn't tell from Harlan.

389
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:37,232
In a few months, he's going on a mission
for the Mormon Church.

390
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:40,641
- I'm not stopping him.
- No, but you could.

391
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:46,506
- Are you one?
- My sister and nephews are.

392
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:49,052
I'm taking a little break.

393
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,385
- And Georgia?
- Not a Mormon.

394
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,119
But she pushes a lot of their family values.

395
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:58,185
People do what they wanna do.

396
00:29:58,263 --> 00:30:00,959
Sometimes what they don't.

397
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:06,467
I'm not sure Harlan could survive you.

398
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:12,900
Ach, come on. Don't preach to me
about what I can and can't do.

399
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,309
Or I will poison you.

400
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,748
Anybody can do anything to anyone.

401
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:23,346
Can't stop what's done to you.
Can only survive it.

402
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:25,446
Oh, please.

403
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:27,286
You're 17.

404
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:32,796
So you're a prisoner of Idaho. I feel for you.
You don't have a clue about surviving.

405
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:37,525
And you invented it, didn't you?

406
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:39,627
We can all tell.

407
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:41,797
The survivor.

408
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:47,140
You wear it so well in your walk,
in your face, in your eyes.

409
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,004
You've got a dead wife
and a dead baby.

410
00:30:51,082 --> 00:30:54,745
And we're all so proud
you're still even here.

411
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:04,526
Do you know I was 12 years old when
my stepfather first started having sex with me?

412
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:08,726
I loved him.
He was nice to me.

413
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,030
We can all survive, Simon.

414
00:31:11,102 --> 00:31:14,663
You just don't have to be
so damn sad doing it.

415
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:28,914
Hey, Rachel. Take a shot.

416
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:32,151
Three, two, one.

417
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,714
Good shot, Rachel.

418
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:40,822
Sorry, we're out of peach.
How about some rhubarb?

419
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:45,999
My girl's name is June.

420
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:49,162
(tune playing over iPod)

421
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:56,905
- Whoa. What? Huh?
- Her name's June.

422
00:31:58,983 --> 00:32:01,144
Is she pretty?

423
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,180
I've known her all my life.

424
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,781
I've never thought of
what you might think of her.

425
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:11,625
We'd said we'd get married
back in sixth grade,

426
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:14,563
and we will.

427
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:19,467
Simon says you might be
going on a mission for the Mormons.

428
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:23,098
Yeah. I'm looking forward to it.

429
00:32:23,174 --> 00:32:26,143
I'm not looking forward
to cutting all my hair off.

430
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:29,509
It's gotta be above the ears for the mission.

431
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,141
Your hair will grow back.
How long do you have to go for?

432
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:35,845
Two years.

433
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,547
Long time.

434
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:42,150
- Can you have sex on a mission?
- (chuckles)

435
00:32:42,226 --> 00:32:43,921
No.

436
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:47,261
Not until you're married.

437
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:52,327
So are you saying
you've never even had sex before?

438
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:55,462
You're a virgin, aren't you?

439
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,474
Have you?

440
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:59,737
(chuckles)

441
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:02,006
That's funny.

442
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:07,846
(quacking)

443
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,716
(dog barks)

444
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:13,582
Are you allowed to look?

445
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,183
Pardon me?

446
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:24,261
Look, I think we better
get back on... get on back.

447
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:30,063
- Have you ever looked?
- Yeah, in a magazine, I suppose.

448
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:32,541
It's getting pretty late.

449
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:35,437
- Would you like to see?
- Better not.

450
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:38,073
Is there a law against looking?

451
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:48,418
You can touch, if you like.

452
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:23,117
My turn.

453
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:28,128
- I think we should stop.
- Hey, that's no fair.

454
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,978
(barks)

455
00:34:42,046 --> 00:34:44,037
(train horn blowing)

456
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:51,877
(sighs)

457
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:59,786
- I don't apologize for anything.
- OK.

458
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:04,499
Hello? Are you gonna invite me in?

459
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,666
No.

460
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:10,764
- Should I be at work tomorrow?
- Why not?

461
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:15,140
I don't know.
I guess what I said about your wife and kid.

462
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:18,446
You were right.
They're dead, and it shows on me.

463
00:35:25,356 --> 00:35:30,350
I just wanted to tell you that all that junk
that I said about my stepfather, I made it all up.

464
00:35:30,428 --> 00:35:32,760
- Sympathy vote.
- You did?

465
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:36,131
I needed to make a point.
I lie if it helps make the point.

466
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,192
I talked to your grandmother
about what you told me.

467
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,738
- Why?
- I didn't have any choice.

468
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,434
- You stupid ass.
- Don't hit me with fish.

469
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:48,275
Can't you tell what the truth is?
Everybody knows I lie. Nobody believes me.

470
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:51,509
- I believe you.
- Well, you don't count.

471
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:56,884
God, I cannot believe that you would do that.
You are such an idiot.

472
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:00,514
(dog barking)

473
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,028
(Georgia) Oh, Rachel...

474
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:16,402
I went fishing with Harlan.
I'm gonna put these in the freezer.

475
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:17,771
Rachel...

476
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,809
I'm gonna ask you once.

477
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:32,789
I'll know whether you're telling me the truth,
because you are a part of me.

478
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:36,850
I don't understand you at all,
but I understand me.

479
00:36:36,928 --> 00:36:38,725
I'll know.

480
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:41,264
I'm really tired.

481
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:43,823
Did Arnold molest you?

482
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,805
If he did, he'd be dead.

483
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:11,795
- You'll be late.
- (phone ringing)

484
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:13,625
Late...

485
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:16,826
- is only relative...
- Mm... hmm.

486
00:37:17,535 --> 00:37:21,130
...to what causes you to become it.

487
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:30,139
If it's not one thing, it's the other. Leave your name
and number, I'll call you back when it's neither.

488
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:36,017
I can hang up and call again,
hang up and call again if that'll help.

489
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,823
- Tact is not one of her gifts.
- Heh... heh.

490
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:49,562
(ringing)

491
00:37:53,671 --> 00:37:55,935
- If it's not one thing, it's the other...
- Sorry.

492
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:58,999
...your name and number,
I'll call you back when it's neither.

493
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:04,170
What?

494
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:12,011
What?

495
00:38:24,435 --> 00:38:27,802
So, what was all the commotion about?

496
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,810
What?

497
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:40,740
(horn blows/bell dinging)

498
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:48,651
- Harlan. Good morning.
- Good morning, Ms. Randall.

499
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:51,024
- Hey, how are ya?
- Your paper.

500
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:52,119
Oh, thanks.

501
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:55,563
- Is Rachel around?
- I think she's still asleep.

502
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:57,624
If I could wait, I'd appreciate it.

503
00:38:58,402 --> 00:39:01,303
Hey, thanks for the fish.

504
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:04,535
Do you think June's pretty?

505
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:08,601
Well, I think I prefer the fall, actually...
September, October...

506
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:12,137
- No, I mean my girl. June Smith.
- Oh.

507
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:14,914
Oh...

508
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:20,389
Yeah, I think those Smith girls
are quite striking. Yeah.

509
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:23,350
Not like Rachel.

510
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:27,022
- Well, no one's like Rachel.
- Harlan?

511
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:31,828
- Pancakes?
- Not now.

512
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:33,529
Wha...?

513
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:37,631
I'm driving to talk to June at her school.
I'd like you to come with me.

514
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:40,905
- Why?
- The only way outta this I see is to marry you.

515
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:42,843
- What?
- What?

516
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:45,245
I gotta tell June in person.

517
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:49,685
- Why'd you let him in?
- I think this is the only way God'll forgive me.

518
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:53,121
Oh, Harlan, I gave you a blow job.

519
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:55,385
It wasn't even a date.

520
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:57,859
I'll wait for you in the truck.

521
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:03,362
Thank you very, very much for breakfast,
Ms. Randall.

522
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:07,268
You know, no good deed goes unpunished.
I gotta change.

523
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:16,143
Meditation is the pathway
to your silent energy,

524
00:40:16,213 --> 00:40:20,843
and by harnessing your silent energy
you will overcome your fear of flying.

525
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:25,912
This is John Gordon. I wanna let you know
that each day you can fuel up with silent energy

526
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:32,088
to improve your health, increase your energy,
reduce your stress and enhance your happiness.

527
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:39,592
So take a few deep breaths, relax and
allow silent energy to recharge and renew you.

528
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:43,333
Remember, you're too blessed
to be stressed.

529
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:58,782
Maybe I was just looking for someone to say no,
and I thought you were it.

530
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:04,890
But you touched me, and, you see,
that gives me the right to do anything.

531
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:09,989
- You were supposed to be religious.
- I should have said no.

532
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:12,535
If you could just... I have to repent.

533
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:17,063
- Repent for what? That's retarded.
- If you could just forgive me, everything...

534
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:20,110
OK. Harlan, you're forgiven.

535
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:21,838
Forgiven.

536
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:23,436
Better now?

537
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:25,948
Abracadabra. I forgive you.

538
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:40,226
(dogs barking)

539
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:47,562
- Lilly.
- She's a liar.

540
00:41:48,739 --> 00:41:51,765
- You drove all the way here to tell me that?

541
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,332
- Rachel!

542
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,435
Out, with a friend.

543
00:41:55,513 --> 00:42:01,816
She was smoking crank in the ninth grade,
K and X, sneaking off to raves.

544
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:04,354
Do you have any idea
what I am talking about?

545
00:42:04,421 --> 00:42:09,085
I knew something was going on,
and she lied about it all the time.

546
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:11,992
She's a destructive liar.

547
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:17,625
- Why are you here, Lilly?
- Arnold denied it. I asked him flat out.

548
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,794
Never happened. Never happened.

549
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:23,863
She's paying me back for banishing her out here.
It's as simple as that.

550
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:27,900
- Then why are you here?
- I'm here to choke the truth out of her.

551
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:31,345
Why do you think I'm here?
Where would you be?

552
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:34,578
She's supposed to be leaving for college,
but who knows now,

553
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:37,177
'cause she lied about sending
the application papers to Vassar,

554
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:41,918
so she's got nowhere to stay
at the damn college.

555
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:44,358
You hungry?

556
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:48,525
(music) Count your many blessings,
name them one by one...

557
00:42:52,603 --> 00:42:56,369
So, you don't drink?

558
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:00,240
Don't do drugs? Don't smoke?

559
00:43:00,311 --> 00:43:02,302
You don't have sex?

560
00:43:02,379 --> 00:43:05,871
Not until I'm married.
Well, you know, hopefully.

561
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:11,081
I don't get it. Why belong to something
so strict and boring?

562
00:43:11,155 --> 00:43:13,715
Well, because it's true.

563
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,259
How can you know anything is true?

564
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:19,160
You choose to believe it's true is what I think.

565
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:22,096
You've gotta have faith in something.

566
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:26,694
I didn't say I didn't have faith
in anything, but I don't.

567
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:28,534
Yeah, I know.

568
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:33,669
(music) Count your many blessings,
see what God has done

569
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:37,805
(blows note) One, two, three...

570
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:43,820
(singing new hymn)

571
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:46,219
(mouths)

572
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:59,565
- Maybe I’Il just say we kissed.
- Great idea.

573
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:03,767
No reason in hurting her feelings
if we're not even getting married.

574
00:44:03,841 --> 00:44:06,901
No, no, we're not getting married.
I don't think so.

575
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:09,605
- Oh, is that her?
- Harlan?

576
00:44:10,748 --> 00:44:12,477
Hey.

577
00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:14,881
- Surprise.
- I'll say.

578
00:44:14,952 --> 00:44:18,752
I only have a minute.
I have to get back to choir practice.

579
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:21,552
- Hello there. Hi.
- Hi.

580
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:26,324
June, I want you to meet my friend Rachel.
She works for Dr. Ward across the street.

581
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:33,269
And, well, you know Mrs. Randall over on Hillview.
This is her granddaughter visiting from California.

582
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:37,171
Rachel Wilcox.
She's going to Vassar in the fall, in New York.

583
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:40,071
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

584
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:42,635
I kissed Harlan.

585
00:44:44,548 --> 00:44:48,040
- That's what this is about, actually.
- On the mouth?

586
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:51,281
No. I wouldn't do that. Not on the mouth.

587
00:44:52,556 --> 00:44:55,616
What does this mean, Harlan?

588
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:57,354
Nothing.

589
00:44:57,428 --> 00:45:02,832
That's what this means. June, I just wanted to
come down and be 110%/ honest about all of this...

590
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:09,464
Just... Listen, the truth is, I took advantage of him,
OK? He had nothing to do with it.

591
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:15,035
I mean, I kissed him. And he wanted to make sure
that nothing came between the two of you.

592
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:18,741
And now it's over and done with,
and we're just friends.

593
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:22,513
- And that's all that happened?
- Yeah, that's it.

594
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:30,359
She, uh, gave me oral sex.

595
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:33,219
He's lying.

596
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,931
But we didn't kiss.

597
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:40,427
June.

598
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:42,165
Juniper.

599
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,900
I mean...

600
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:44,998
June bug.

601
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:48,135
(chiming)

602
00:45:56,453 --> 00:46:01,015
When Dad was dying, nearly dead,
did you ever miss a meal?

603
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:03,924
Eat late? Eat early?

604
00:46:03,994 --> 00:46:06,258
No. Same time.

605
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:09,492
Alone.

606
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:12,160
I could turn the radio on.

607
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:13,635
((music) classical)

608
00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:17,572
You're a minute late. Enjoy your meal.
I'm gonna go wait for Rachel.

609
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:22,071
Life is much less of a surprise
when it's all timed down.

610
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:29,609
This isn't a surprise, Mother.
This is a damn lie.

611
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:41,587
((music) rock playing over radio)

612
00:46:51,742 --> 00:46:53,607
Hey.

613
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:55,668
Come on, we're here.

614
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:03,378
So, the deal is, I can't see you,
talk to you or be anywhere near you?

615
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:08,052
I wasn't exactly in the bargaining position.

616
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:13,023
It's not fair.

617
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:19,193
She's gonna have everyone she knows
watching me from now on.

618
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:24,532
You're my only friend.

619
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:30,572
OK, fine.

620
00:47:33,383 --> 00:47:34,350
Rachel...

621
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:42,148
OK, well...

622
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:44,888
...bye.

623
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,530
Enjoy yourself?

624
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:04,371
Have fun?

625
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:08,312
Mom, what are you doing here?
Where's Grandma?

626
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,683
Went to bed. I waited up for you.

627
00:48:11,488 --> 00:48:13,319
I have been sitting here for hours

628
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:18,350
thinking how is it that I'm ever
gonna be able to forgive you?

629
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:20,794
Sometimes I think the same thing
about you.

630
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:29,796
And then it occurred to me a while ago
that the only weapon I have left...

631
00:48:31,108 --> 00:48:33,440
I've used every other...

632
00:48:37,447 --> 00:48:39,608
is my love for you.

633
00:48:39,683 --> 00:48:42,481
You could have phoned it in, Mom.

634
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:46,545
- I love you.
- Did you practice that in the mirror?

635
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:48,318
Wait.

636
00:48:48,392 --> 00:48:54,388
He thinks of you as his own daughter.
That's what I don't understand. He loves you.

637
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:57,900
The question is, does he love you
how he loves me?

638
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:04,433
- I want the truth.
- That's why you're here?

639
00:49:04,508 --> 00:49:06,533
Yeah, say it. Say it!

640
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:09,773
He must have said it to you.
Why drive ten hours to hear it again?

641
00:49:09,846 --> 00:49:12,679
He did say it, and I believe him.

642
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:16,276
I want you to say it.

643
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:18,082
Rachel!

644
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:25,761
I don't think you know the difference anymore,
what's right or wrong,

645
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:28,525
what is a lie and what is the truth.

646
00:49:30,267 --> 00:49:33,259
Yeah, OK, that is my fault.

647
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:37,467
I just... I didn't wanna be like my mother,

648
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:39,873
with her good and bad and her rules...

649
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:43,674
- Tell me what you want me to say.
- He never touched you.

650
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:46,375
He never touched me.

651
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:48,281
He never climbed on top of me,

652
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:52,880
never put his hand on my thigh
when your head was turned at the table at dinner.

653
00:49:52,956 --> 00:49:56,756
He never put his mouth on my body.
Never, Mom.

654
00:49:57,794 --> 00:49:59,785
I said it.

655
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:45,399
- I can't...
- (dog barks)

656
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,229
(knock on door)

657
00:51:25,982 --> 00:51:27,973
Not right now, Grandma.

658
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:31,510
I'm proud of you.

659
00:51:41,832 --> 00:51:45,393
Yes, such a happy morning.

660
00:51:45,469 --> 00:51:49,735
Yes, I have to cut your nails. Yes, I do.

661
00:51:49,806 --> 00:51:53,139
They're getting a little long.
(coos)

662
00:51:57,647 --> 00:51:59,080
(door closes)

663
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:16,964
When did it start?

664
00:52:17,033 --> 00:52:19,934
- When I was 12.
- When did it stop?

665
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:25,832
When a friend of mine
threatened to kill him.

666
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:28,343
That's when I was 14.

667
00:52:28,411 --> 00:52:33,940
He bought me the Mustang on the condition
that I start again, so I crashed it.

668
00:52:34,017 --> 00:52:36,781
Rachel? Ha...

669
00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:41,589
Ham and cheese. One's for Simon.

670
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,649
Here you go.

671
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:47,620
Yeah, have a nice day.

672
00:52:55,172 --> 00:53:00,132
If you're not in for breakfast in 15 minutes,
you'll have to wait for lunch.

673
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:05,704
(chirping)

674
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:20,855
Let's go, kids. It's open.

675
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:24,526
Go like this. Ready? Hold my hand.

676
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:29,163
You go like this. A circle.
You can use other colors.

677
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:31,673
- Good. That's pretty.
- Thanks so much, Rachel.

678
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:36,940
- Oh, you're welcome.
- We will not bite Mommy's ear again, will we? No.

679
00:53:37,013 --> 00:53:39,777
- Bye. Thanks.
- Bye. Good to see you.

680
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:44,746
- Thanks, Mr. Wells. I'm sure we'll see you again.
- Thank you, Doc.

681
00:53:44,821 --> 00:53:46,618
Hello.

682
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:48,920
That is $25, sir.

683
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:51,984
No. Doc usually just sends me a bill
now and then.

684
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:56,260
Unless you've made prior arrangements,
then it's $25, today.

685
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:01,064
- Where's Fern?
- She's on vacation. I'm not really sure.

686
00:54:01,137 --> 00:54:02,798
Cash or check?

687
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:08,071
- This is not the way we usually do it around here.
- Well, I'm new.

688
00:54:08,144 --> 00:54:10,339
It shows.

689
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:13,780
I've written "paid in full" on your receipt.

690
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:19,880
I'll let you take these as a reminder.
They're copies of your previous unpaid bills.

691
00:54:19,956 --> 00:54:22,447
- When's Fern coming back?
- No idea.

692
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:25,858
- I'll send you a weekly reminder until they're paid.
- Thank you.

693
00:54:25,929 --> 00:54:28,659
- Welcome.
- I'm not happy, Andy.

694
00:54:28,732 --> 00:54:30,723
Have a good day.

695
00:54:31,701 --> 00:54:38,072
Amazing. I haven't got a nickel out of him
in four years, and you get $25 in two minutes.

696
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:39,631
I'm good at getting.

697
00:54:40,243 --> 00:54:42,575
- I'll be right with you, Mr. Lynwood.
- (squawks)

698
00:54:42,646 --> 00:54:44,773
((music) guitar)

699
00:54:48,418 --> 00:54:51,285
How long have you been doing that for?

700
00:54:52,255 --> 00:54:54,280
Since college.

701
00:54:54,357 --> 00:54:56,985
It relaxes me. I just play for myself.

702
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:01,861
- Have you dated since your wife passed away?
- Hasn't entered my mind.

703
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:03,990
(plucks strings)

704
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:07,525
- You know, I used to date your mother.
- I know.

705
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:12,005
In fact, I was crazy about her.

706
00:55:12,776 --> 00:55:15,677
Why didn't you marry her,
save us all the trouble?

707
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:19,977
Things don't always work out
the way you think they should.

708
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:22,314
But you know about that.

709
00:55:22,385 --> 00:55:26,617
Wait. That's weird.
So you could have been my dad.

710
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:28,885
Your dad had a car. I had a cow.

711
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:32,416
Huh. It's always about a car.
Pizza's ready.

712
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:36,155
(phone ringing)

713
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:44,431
At least talk to him long enough
to tell him you're not talking to him.

714
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,372
Just pick up and hang up.

715
00:55:46,443 --> 00:55:49,810
Pick up and hang up,
pick up and hang up and so on.

716
00:55:49,879 --> 00:55:53,212
Do you have anything this size

717
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:55,683
that's serrated, hmm?

718
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:58,880
He's got thick skin.

719
00:55:58,955 --> 00:56:00,217
(scoffs) Hmm?

720
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:07,496
You know what's hysterical about all this?

721
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:10,763
I signed a prenuptial.

722
00:56:10,834 --> 00:56:13,428
I'm going to end up back here

723
00:56:13,503 --> 00:56:19,203
with nothing and no one,
living in a place I am not welcome.

724
00:56:19,275 --> 00:56:22,073
Who says you're not welcome?

725
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:24,608
Your face.

726
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:30,417
At least he'll be in prison.

727
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:33,320
Arnold is one of the best
criminal defense lawyers

728
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,881
in California, Mother.

729
00:56:35,959 --> 00:56:42,364
He's not gonna end up anywhere but free,
happy, laughing and playing golf.

730
00:56:45,435 --> 00:56:47,426
Go with this one.

731
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:57,535
So, did you know my real dad?

732
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:03,345
He was exactly what you wouldn't want
a daughter to marry.

733
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:07,789
Lilly was angry with everybody, even me,
when she left with him.

734
00:57:07,857 --> 00:57:11,725
- How could you even stand her?
- She reminds me of you.

735
00:57:11,795 --> 00:57:13,786
I know.

736
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,425
There.

737
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:21,432
- Do you wanna hear something weird?
- Probably not.

738
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:25,699
When Arnold held me, I hated the sex.

739
00:57:27,143 --> 00:57:31,546
But then, sometimes before,
when he just held me,

740
00:57:33,516 --> 00:57:36,246
I felt loved.

741
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:39,254
And I... I mean, how can that be true?

742
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:45,024
Maybe the holding part was love, Rachel.
I'm not sure.

743
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:49,193
But I know everything else was a lie.

744
00:57:54,604 --> 00:57:57,835
I'm gonna show you the top to this stupid thing
so we can finish it.

745
00:57:57,907 --> 00:57:58,999
- I won't look.
- Here.

746
00:57:59,075 --> 00:58:00,804
I'm not looking.

747
00:58:00,877 --> 00:58:04,643
How can you do a puzzle,
if you don't know what it looks like?

748
00:58:04,714 --> 00:58:10,414
It's like telling you how your life will end.
It makes everything in between killing time.

749
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:13,513
- Go home.
- I don't wanna go home.

750
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:16,388
You can't stay here. Good night.

751
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:28,095
(clock chiming)

752
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,335
Time for bed.

753
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:41,573
(dog barking)

754
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:44,610
(footsteps, running)

755
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:06,134
I found these in the closet.

756
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:10,568
- I thought they'd be safer there.
- (giggles)

757
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:17,644
Most people dig out presents they don't like
when the person that gave them comes to visit.

758
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:21,417
I don't keep flowers in the house.

759
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:25,728
It's two past ten, Mother. Go to bed.

760
00:59:32,135 --> 00:59:33,397
(gasps)

761
00:59:35,104 --> 00:59:36,765
Oh, come on.

762
00:59:38,041 --> 00:59:41,772
There was a time you'd have dragged me
by hair for drinking.

763
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:45,473
I'm too old. So's your hair.

764
00:59:45,548 --> 00:59:48,517
(snickers) That's good.

765
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:50,576
(water running)

766
00:59:53,156 --> 00:59:55,488
These go here.

767
00:59:55,558 --> 00:59:56,957
Here. There.

768
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:05,558
(Lilly) Oh.

769
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:07,664
(Lilly) Whoo.

770
01:00:08,972 --> 01:00:12,237
- Whoo... ooh... ooh.
- Come here. Let me take you to bed.

771
01:00:12,308 --> 01:00:17,007
You don't get second chances.
Don't try and save me. I'm not savable.

772
01:00:17,080 --> 01:00:19,674
Everybody's savable. That's the rule.

773
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:25,619
Screw your rules. I begged you, "Please, Mommy"
for help at Daddy's funeral.

774
01:00:25,688 --> 01:00:30,990
And that's when I needed saving, Mother,
but, no, you wouldn't give me a cent.

775
01:00:31,060 --> 01:00:35,622
- You were drinking.
- I was alone with a four year old. I was scared.

776
01:00:35,698 --> 01:00:39,156
Arnold saved us. Arnold saved me.

777
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:41,863
I wanted you to stay.

778
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:44,805
I wanted you to die.

779
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:54,447
Not really.

780
01:00:54,517 --> 01:00:56,178
Just a little.

781
01:00:57,286 --> 01:00:59,686
Why do you need to hurt her?

782
01:01:01,224 --> 01:01:03,590
Because you slept with my husband.

783
01:01:10,867 --> 01:01:13,358
- Rachel... Aah!
- (glass shatters)

784
01:01:13,436 --> 01:01:15,631
Mom?

785
01:01:15,705 --> 01:01:18,037
Grandma. I need help.

786
01:01:18,107 --> 01:01:19,972
- I'll handle it.
- I didn't touch her.

787
01:01:20,043 --> 01:01:22,341
- Don't touch me.
- Go to your room.

788
01:01:22,412 --> 01:01:27,782
- Why did you let her start again?
- I can handle it. Leave me with her. Go.

789
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:32,844
Let me look.

790
01:01:35,425 --> 01:01:38,724
- Careful of the glass. Can you get up?
- Mm... hmm.

791
01:01:38,795 --> 01:01:42,060
- I am getting up. Where we going?
- I'm gonna put you in bed...

792
01:01:42,131 --> 01:01:44,599
and I'm gonna give you an aspirin.

793
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:48,262
I'm good. I'm gonna make this. OK.

794
01:01:48,337 --> 01:01:51,738
I'm gonna...
I'm good...

795
01:01:51,808 --> 01:01:55,039
- Whoa, I'm gonna throw up.
- Not on the rug.

796
01:01:55,111 --> 01:01:58,979
Let me help. I've done this before.
Come on, Mom.

797
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:05,286
This is good. This is good.
(giggles)

798
01:02:05,354 --> 01:02:09,791
Lilly, can you make it upstairs
without throwing up, please?

799
01:02:09,859 --> 01:02:11,850
((music) harmonica)

800
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:23,428
I am fishing.

801
01:02:23,506 --> 01:02:26,566
It's just me and my dog.

802
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:31,479
And Rachel's not here,
and I'm not happy about it.

803
01:02:33,816 --> 01:02:36,011
The doctor won't hurt you. It's OK.

804
01:02:46,229 --> 01:02:49,255
I don't know, Melody.
He seems like a pretty calm pig.

805
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:55,100
Yeah, right now, but then, suddenly, he gets
all jumpy, starts running around and squealing,

806
01:02:55,171 --> 01:02:57,662
and he disrupts the other pigs.

807
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:00,334
- You think it's stress?
- Pig stress?

808
01:03:12,855 --> 01:03:14,846
Slut.

809
01:03:15,525 --> 01:03:17,356
Slut!

810
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:40,577
I gotta get to work.
I got that lasso in for you.

811
01:03:41,684 --> 01:03:46,678
- He doesn't think I'm pretty. He doesn't like me.
- No, he likes Trouble, on the bench over there.

812
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:51,283
(water runs)

813
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:02,299
Where's Rachel?

814
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:04,362
- At Simon's.
- Goody.

815
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:07,807
I told her to go there till you're better.
Where you going?

816
01:04:07,877 --> 01:04:12,143
- I'm going for a drive.
- You're not dressed for a drive.

817
01:04:12,215 --> 01:04:14,683
I'm thirsty, OK? I'm dying of thirst.

818
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:19,881
I'm waking up, I can't stand the feeling.
I'm gonna go buy booze, busybody.

819
01:04:20,456 --> 01:04:24,688
- It wasn't a question.
- No more drinking in the house. Georgia rule.

820
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:29,220
Mother, let me go.
I don't care about your rules. Fuck off.

821
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:32,592
Get off me. Get off me!

822
01:04:36,138 --> 01:04:39,369
All right, all right.

823
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:46,645
I called Arnold last night,
and I asked him for a divorce.

824
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:50,208
OK, Mother?

825
01:04:52,788 --> 01:04:54,551
You lost your...

826
01:04:57,193 --> 01:04:59,184
My mind?

827
01:05:00,496 --> 01:05:02,293
I'll get the booze.

828
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:04,356
Go inside.

829
01:05:10,806 --> 01:05:12,797
Thank you.

830
01:05:18,447 --> 01:05:20,642
Have a nice party, Georgia.

831
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:33,425
"A in Science" for $2,000, please...

832
01:05:33,496 --> 01:05:39,867
- Thanks for letting me stay over tonight.
- Well, Georgia thought it might be a good idea.

833
01:05:40,636 --> 01:05:42,501
What's an Allosaurus?

834
01:05:42,571 --> 01:05:46,302
- I think it's a good idea.
- "Heraldic Beasts", $400, please.

835
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:49,242
I found some perfume under the sink.

836
01:05:50,313 --> 01:05:52,611
I didn't think you'd mind it.

837
01:05:53,582 --> 01:05:58,076
- I forgot I still had that.
- It's next to your stash of toilet paper.

838
01:05:58,154 --> 01:06:01,646
- Every time you change a roll, you see it.
- What's the Loch Ness Monster?

839
01:06:01,724 --> 01:06:05,387
- No. Doug?
- What's an elephant?

840
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:08,897
- Do you ever smell it?
- No, I try not to.

841
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:11,866
Do you think she'd want you to?

842
01:06:11,934 --> 01:06:13,925
- Erika?
- Who is Ginsberg?

843
01:06:14,003 --> 01:06:15,766
"Poets" for $1200, please.

844
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:21,299
Poem containing the line "Perched upon
a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door."

845
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:23,607
- What is "The Raven?"
- Right.

846
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:27,206
- "Poets," $1600, please.
- Can I ask you a favor?

847
01:06:27,283 --> 01:06:29,342
During the commercial.

848
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,911
Can I hold on to you?

849
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:37,017
- Hold on to me?
- Just lean against you.

850
01:06:39,128 --> 01:06:42,655
I just like to feel somebody next to me.

851
01:06:42,732 --> 01:06:46,498
- "Beasts" for $1200.
- This animal is on the Lopez family coat of arms,

852
01:06:46,569 --> 01:06:50,767
probably because the name Lopez
comes from the Latin for it.

853
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,570
- What is a wolf?
- Kathleen. Yes.

854
01:06:53,642 --> 01:06:55,837
Can I ask you another favor?

855
01:06:56,746 --> 01:06:58,304
What?

856
01:06:58,381 --> 01:07:00,372
Relax.

857
01:07:04,987 --> 01:07:09,481
I'm gonna go to bed.
There are blankets and pillows in the closet.

858
01:07:11,827 --> 01:07:13,761
(knock on door)

859
01:07:13,829 --> 01:07:16,354
You're gonna have to eat something sometime.

860
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:21,196
I'm gonna open the door.

861
01:07:29,512 --> 01:07:34,108
- Oh, you cut your hair.
- It was getting in the way of my drinking.

862
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:41,622
All I remember are Dad's hugs,

863
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:43,419
his laugh.

864
01:07:43,492 --> 01:07:47,121
After all of it, just good things.

865
01:07:47,196 --> 01:07:49,187
Well, good.

866
01:07:49,265 --> 01:07:53,463
Why did you try so hard
to take that away from me?

867
01:07:53,536 --> 01:07:56,096
- Did I?
- Little things.

868
01:07:56,172 --> 01:07:59,539
We loved to watch TV together,
so you took it away.

869
01:07:59,608 --> 01:08:03,442
Television was a distraction.
Your grades were slipping.

870
01:08:03,512 --> 01:08:07,039
Were you afraid how much
Daddy and I were alike?

871
01:08:07,116 --> 01:08:11,450
How much he relied on me?
How little he wanted from you?

872
01:08:12,388 --> 01:08:17,382
You know, mostly... I was afraid
you'd run off and marry an idiot,

873
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:21,692
lose everything you had a chance at,
just like me.

874
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:25,629
I blamed you for his drinking.

875
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:28,828
Oh. For yours, too?

876
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:31,337
Yeah.

877
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:38,679
You know what I don't understand,
along with all the rest of it?

878
01:08:38,747 --> 01:08:40,738
I haven't got a clue.

879
01:08:41,851 --> 01:08:45,343
- If you ever really loved me.
- (scoffs)

880
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:46,911
Don't be ridiculous.

881
01:08:46,989 --> 01:08:51,551
No, I mean, just ever.
It wouldn't have to include right now.

882
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:53,686
What do you think the rules were?

883
01:08:53,762 --> 01:08:59,132
Why would I waste my time
on somebody that I didn't care about?

884
01:09:00,336 --> 01:09:07,071
Yeah. I can't ever remember
you saying it.

885
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:09,634
Well, my parents never said it.

886
01:09:09,712 --> 01:09:12,476
So how do you know if they did?

887
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:15,773
I don't.

888
01:09:25,928 --> 01:09:30,991
I hate that you bought me so many.

889
01:09:32,735 --> 01:09:35,329
You gonna drink the rest of them?

890
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:37,164
No.

891
01:10:05,067 --> 01:10:07,228
How could I not love you?

892
01:10:28,023 --> 01:10:28,887
Rachel?

893
01:10:29,358 --> 01:10:31,417
It's just Dr. Ward today.

894
01:10:32,928 --> 01:10:38,764
- She just needs a little more exercise, more walks.
- You hear that, Bertha?

895
01:10:38,834 --> 01:10:42,270
Come on. Hey.
Just have to cut out on the snacking.

896
01:10:44,306 --> 01:10:46,433
Tell her she's fat.

897
01:10:46,508 --> 01:10:48,373
You are fat.

898
01:10:48,444 --> 01:10:53,040
See what I told you?
He's a doctor. It's not just me saying it.

899
01:10:53,115 --> 01:10:55,106
- Thanks, Dr. Ward.
- Sure.

900
01:10:58,621 --> 01:11:01,112
You look great with short hair.

901
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:09,530
- Where's Rachel?
- It's Saturday. I gave her the day off.

902
01:11:09,598 --> 01:11:11,998
She went fishing with Harlan.

903
01:11:15,337 --> 01:11:18,170
I need to stop drinking.

904
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:21,266
I'm in no hurry.

905
01:11:22,244 --> 01:11:26,044
- How can I help?
- She's pregnant, is all.

906
01:11:28,484 --> 01:11:32,113
Why don't you wait in the office?
This'll take a second.

907
01:11:32,187 --> 01:11:34,178
(radio playing)

908
01:11:37,326 --> 01:11:40,295
She's got that California tan.

909
01:11:40,362 --> 01:11:44,731
- You think it's real or a spray... on?
- I don't know.

910
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:50,934
- It's risky being my friend.
- Well, that's what I was coming around to is...

911
01:11:51,006 --> 01:11:54,271
maybe we could be more than friends, you know,

912
01:11:54,343 --> 01:11:57,244
if you thought you could ever sort of...

913
01:11:58,247 --> 01:11:59,976
I don't know...

914
01:12:00,049 --> 01:12:01,914
love me?

915
01:12:06,789 --> 01:12:08,950
I'm kicking men, Harlan.

916
01:12:10,526 --> 01:12:15,122
No, really. So I guess that's what
I was trying to say... kicking men.

917
01:12:15,197 --> 01:12:19,531
Yeah, well, I'll be gone for two years
on this mission.

918
01:12:20,869 --> 01:12:23,463
You can't kick forever, can you?

919
01:12:25,507 --> 01:12:27,168
I promise I'll write.

920
01:12:27,876 --> 01:12:32,438
I think they're going. Get on the cellphone.
Call the girls. Let's follow her.

921
01:12:35,551 --> 01:12:39,851
More kittens.
As if this town needs more cats.

922
01:12:39,922 --> 01:12:41,913
And that was my last patient.

923
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:47,685
- (clock chiming)
- Remember the clock tower?

924
01:12:47,763 --> 01:12:50,994
- I do. Do you?
- Like it was yesterday.

925
01:12:51,066 --> 01:12:53,159
We changed the clock back.

926
01:12:53,836 --> 01:12:56,168
Yeah, yeah.

927
01:12:56,238 --> 01:13:01,039
And the whole day,
the whole town was just a mess.

928
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:04,410
Except you. You weren't a mess.

929
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:07,040
Anyway, um...

930
01:13:07,116 --> 01:13:09,448
I need Antabuse.

931
01:13:10,819 --> 01:13:13,447
That makes you violently ill if you drink.

932
01:13:13,522 --> 01:13:15,717
I already am violently ill.

933
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:21,857
I'm going to Rexburg later.
I'll pick some up.

934
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:23,921
Thanks.

935
01:13:25,634 --> 01:13:27,625
Is that all you need?

936
01:13:29,838 --> 01:13:32,500
How did I miss what I missed?

937
01:13:34,877 --> 01:13:36,970
People get busy.

938
01:13:37,045 --> 01:13:42,449
Too busy to notice
what your husband is doing to your daughter?

939
01:13:42,518 --> 01:13:44,509
I don't know how you missed that.

940
01:13:46,488 --> 01:13:48,683
You always tell me the truth.

941
01:13:49,825 --> 01:13:51,816
Thank you.

942
01:14:24,693 --> 01:14:27,025
- What was that?
- I'm sorry.

943
01:14:28,430 --> 01:14:29,522
No...

944
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:33,332
Thank you. Thank you.

945
01:14:34,036 --> 01:14:36,027
I gotta go.

946
01:15:01,463 --> 01:15:04,159
How long do we have to sit here for?

947
01:15:05,267 --> 01:15:07,258
Smells like rain.

948
01:15:08,937 --> 01:15:11,667
OK. Let's do it. Mandy, get ready.

949
01:15:15,777 --> 01:15:18,075
Give us a break, Grace.

950
01:15:18,146 --> 01:15:20,137
Let's go.

951
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:23,750
Car won't start.

952
01:15:27,122 --> 01:15:28,316
Whoa. Oh.

953
01:15:30,959 --> 01:15:34,520
- She's gonna ram us.
- Oh, my God. Get out. Go.

954
01:15:35,397 --> 01:15:37,763
(truck radio blasting)

955
01:15:56,818 --> 01:16:00,379
Hi. Want to introduce myself.
Rachel Wilcox. Nice to meet you.

956
01:16:00,455 --> 01:16:03,151
- Grace Cunningham.
- Howdy, girls. How you doing?

957
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:08,663
Look, I just drove over to tell you
that Harlan and I, we're just friends now.

958
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:12,063
Nothing's gonna happen again.
I promise. Scout's honor.

959
01:16:12,134 --> 01:16:16,537
So you guys can go and do whatever it is you do,
have your summer fun.

960
01:16:16,605 --> 01:16:20,041
And tell June that we're apart,
even if we're not,

961
01:16:20,108 --> 01:16:22,702
'cause nothing's gonna happen,
and whatever's happened has happened already,

962
01:16:22,778 --> 01:16:25,269
so that's the end of it.

963
01:16:25,347 --> 01:16:29,306
Fine. Then why don't you just go home
and leave us all alone?

964
01:16:29,885 --> 01:16:34,413
OK, I tried to be nice. Let me put this a different way,
'cause you're not getting it.

965
01:16:34,489 --> 01:16:38,255
If you call me a name,
if you throw something at me ever again,

966
01:16:38,327 --> 01:16:43,162
if I see you talking to Harlan, yelling at Harlan,
having anything at all to do with Harlan,

967
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:47,634
I will find all of your boyfriends,
and I will fuck them stupid.

968
01:16:49,871 --> 01:16:52,601
OK? Get it?

969
01:16:53,141 --> 01:16:55,609
Thanks for your time.
Have a good summer.

970
01:16:56,878 --> 01:17:00,871
- I am gonna pray for her.
- (thunder crashes)

971
01:17:02,117 --> 01:17:03,141
Harlan.

972
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:17,928
(music) People on the street now

973
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,991
(music) Faces long and grim

974
01:17:21,503 --> 01:17:23,562
(music) Souls are feeling heavy and

975
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:24,731
(dog barks)

976
01:17:24,806 --> 01:17:27,502
(music) Faith is growing thin

977
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:30,407
(music) Fears are getting stronger

978
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:33,141
(music) You can feel them on the rise

979
01:17:34,216 --> 01:17:37,049
(music) Hopelessness got some by the throat

980
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:40,418
(music) You can see it in their eyes

981
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:43,424
(music) I said, "How come?"

982
01:17:47,029 --> 01:17:49,827
(music) I said, "How come?"

983
01:17:53,301 --> 01:17:54,393
(rings doorbell)

984
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:56,596
(music) How come?

985
01:17:59,374 --> 01:18:01,569
Hi. I'm looking for my wife.

986
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:11,083
- Whose Ferrari is that?
- My stepfather's here.

987
01:18:22,497 --> 01:18:24,192
Hey, nice car.

988
01:18:24,266 --> 01:18:25,927
- (dog barks)
- Rachel...

989
01:18:28,103 --> 01:18:32,403
Just how badly do you hate me
to have to live with this lie?

990
01:18:32,474 --> 01:18:34,408
I don't hate you.

991
01:18:37,112 --> 01:18:40,138
- You're on private property.
- Hi, Georgia. I'm...

992
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:42,782
Just give me a moment, OK?

993
01:18:46,621 --> 01:18:49,089
I shouldn't have agreed to pass you off

994
01:18:49,157 --> 01:18:52,320
to someone who you don't know
because I didn't have the patience.

995
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:56,922
I should've taken the time.
I should've been there.

996
01:18:56,998 --> 01:18:59,023
What are you doing here?

997
01:19:02,170 --> 01:19:04,331
- What am I doing here?
- Yeah.

998
01:19:04,406 --> 01:19:08,934
You called me to tell me you're leaving me,
and then you hang up?

999
01:19:09,010 --> 01:19:11,740
And you wanna know what I'm doing here?

1000
01:19:13,181 --> 01:19:18,084
If I had touched my daughter,
I wouldn't be here, would I?

1001
01:19:19,955 --> 01:19:22,947
Come on, honey. Please. You...

1002
01:19:24,693 --> 01:19:27,457
You know me better than anyone on earth.

1003
01:19:27,529 --> 01:19:31,260
- She told me...
- What did she tell you? Huh?

1004
01:19:31,333 --> 01:19:35,793
That she wasn't using drugs
when you found LSD in her room? Huh?

1005
01:19:35,871 --> 01:19:40,899
That she wasn't stealing from you
when I found your emerald ring in a pawn shop?

1006
01:19:40,976 --> 01:19:44,935
Or that she hadn't been drinking
when she crashed her car?

1007
01:19:46,081 --> 01:19:48,140
How many lies have I told?

1008
01:19:48,216 --> 01:19:51,117
Oh, please. You're a lawyer.

1009
01:19:51,853 --> 01:19:54,981
I am fighting for my life, goddammit.

1010
01:19:55,056 --> 01:19:57,547
Don't speak to her like that.

1011
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:05,429
OK.

1012
01:20:07,402 --> 01:20:13,830
If this was something I couldn't change...
an accident, an illness... I'd accept it.

1013
01:20:13,909 --> 01:20:17,003
She would not lie
about something like this.

1014
01:20:18,213 --> 01:20:20,272
Would I?

1015
01:20:22,217 --> 01:20:24,014
I don't know.

1016
01:20:24,085 --> 01:20:26,815
Honey, please. Please.

1017
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:32,324
Put this in your mouth,
get in your car, and drive.

1018
01:20:32,394 --> 01:20:36,455
I love your daughter, and I love Rachel,
and I would never do anything...

1019
01:20:36,531 --> 01:20:39,796
- What are you doing?
- You do not take the Lord's name in vain.

1020
01:20:39,868 --> 01:20:42,701
You do not fool around
with little girls. Drive.

1021
01:20:42,771 --> 01:20:45,069
I'm not moving.
I am staying right here.

1022
01:20:47,576 --> 01:20:51,569
- Swear to God, I never touched her.
- Save it for the appeal.

1023
01:20:51,646 --> 01:20:56,310
If you don't put that in your mouth soon,
I'm gonna dismantle your car.

1024
01:20:56,384 --> 01:20:58,352
OK.

1025
01:20:59,821 --> 01:21:02,119
I'm leaving. All right?

1026
01:21:05,427 --> 01:21:10,831
I'll be here until Lilly's ready
to come home to San Francisco, OK?

1027
01:21:28,817 --> 01:21:30,785
What if he's innocent?

1028
01:21:30,852 --> 01:21:34,015
Well, it felt really good anyway.

1029
01:21:42,197 --> 01:21:42,891
Rachel...

1030
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:45,328
Rachel...

1031
01:21:46,868 --> 01:21:50,133
- Can I talk to you?
- No.

1032
01:21:50,205 --> 01:21:52,435
Can you talk to me?

1033
01:21:55,777 --> 01:21:56,505
Rachel.

1034
01:22:01,049 --> 01:22:06,180
I'm at the only motel in this town,
next to the Halfway House Cafe.

1035
01:22:06,688 --> 01:22:09,521
Lil, just hear me out, please.

1036
01:22:10,558 --> 01:22:15,621
Rachel will get over her anger and take back this lie
one day, but where will you and I be?

1037
01:22:15,697 --> 01:22:20,225
What kind of life will we have led
until that happens?

1038
01:22:20,302 --> 01:22:23,169
I just don't want you to regret not believing me.

1039
01:22:23,238 --> 01:22:27,766
But I need you here with me, now.

1040
01:22:33,515 --> 01:22:35,449
I don't know who to believe.

1041
01:22:37,118 --> 01:22:41,282
You have to believe that
I wanted her to go to rehab, but, uh...

1042
01:22:41,356 --> 01:22:47,625
you said no, remember? You said
you didn't wanna get into your own demons, right?

1043
01:22:49,898 --> 01:22:52,526
That's true.

1044
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:57,670
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thank you.

1045
01:22:57,739 --> 01:22:59,866
Nothing? No baked potato special...

1046
01:22:59,941 --> 01:23:02,171
- You're just gonna sit there?
- It's fine.

1047
01:23:02,243 --> 01:23:05,041
I'll take care of you. Thank you.

1048
01:23:08,149 --> 01:23:12,984
I'll do anything
to show you how much I love you

1049
01:23:13,054 --> 01:23:16,820
and how easy it is for me
to forgive her. OK?

1050
01:23:18,626 --> 01:23:22,687
We'll find our way through this.
I know we can.

1051
01:23:22,764 --> 01:23:24,459
Rachel. Oh...

1052
01:23:26,101 --> 01:23:28,899
I didn't know where you were.
Are you OK?

1053
01:23:30,305 --> 01:23:32,773
I'm fine, Grandma.

1054
01:23:34,509 --> 01:23:39,708
I want you to stay there at Simon's.
And I think probably your mom's gonna call.

1055
01:23:39,781 --> 01:23:43,376
- OK?
- Yeah. OK, I'll talk to you later.

1056
01:23:44,185 --> 01:23:47,586
I have to go. I'm cooking Simon dinner.

1057
01:23:47,655 --> 01:23:49,646
I love you, sweetie.

1058
01:23:51,393 --> 01:23:53,293
(music) Can you count on me?

1059
01:23:53,361 --> 01:23:55,022
(music) I won't let you down...

1060
01:23:55,096 --> 01:23:56,028
(knock on door)

1061
01:23:56,097 --> 01:23:58,691
(music)... woman is so sensational

1062
01:23:58,767 --> 01:24:01,099
(music) No, you can count on me...

1063
01:24:01,302 --> 01:24:02,997
- Hello?
- (knocking)

1064
01:24:03,938 --> 01:24:06,406
- Who is it?
- Me.

1065
01:24:11,379 --> 01:24:13,438
Hi.

1066
01:24:13,515 --> 01:24:16,848
- I need a bathroom.
- OK. Are you OK?

1067
01:24:18,386 --> 01:24:21,355
This way. Make a left.
Right here on the left.

1068
01:24:21,423 --> 01:24:23,414
(coughs/throws up)

1069
01:24:25,827 --> 01:24:27,658
I'll get you water.

1070
01:24:36,471 --> 01:24:37,460
(music stops)

1071
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:40,701
Here you go.

1072
01:24:40,775 --> 01:24:42,402
I...

1073
01:24:43,178 --> 01:24:47,877
It's always so much easier to believe what you need
than what you know.

1074
01:24:47,949 --> 01:24:49,940
I need Arnold.

1075
01:24:51,186 --> 01:24:55,680
He has me convinced.
And you have me convinced.

1076
01:24:58,626 --> 01:25:01,288
He finally got his Ferrari, huh?

1077
01:25:07,969 --> 01:25:10,301
Help me understand.

1078
01:25:11,406 --> 01:25:17,936
I need to just tell you what I feel,
because all I saw was how much you loved him.

1079
01:25:18,012 --> 01:25:20,480
How much he loved you.

1080
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:24,316
How much he loves me.

1081
01:25:27,455 --> 01:25:30,515
And I thought, "How lucky we are."

1082
01:25:31,392 --> 01:25:38,457
I just can't fit what he's done
with who I always thought he was.

1083
01:25:41,569 --> 01:25:43,799
I came to tell you I believe you.

1084
01:25:46,274 --> 01:25:48,208
I like your hair short.

1085
01:25:48,276 --> 01:25:52,007
And that none of this is your fault.

1086
01:25:53,381 --> 01:25:55,906
None of this is your fault.

1087
01:26:04,392 --> 01:26:06,986
I really did just say it to make a point.

1088
01:26:10,698 --> 01:26:12,529
What?

1089
01:26:14,702 --> 01:26:18,297
Simon believed me.
Grandma believed me.

1090
01:26:20,375 --> 01:26:23,276
Mom, I just wanted to see if you did.

1091
01:26:32,921 --> 01:26:35,014
Oh, please...

1092
01:26:37,559 --> 01:26:39,823
I screwed up with Vassar.

1093
01:26:39,894 --> 01:26:44,263
I screwed it all up, and I knew
I wasn't ever coming home again.

1094
01:26:44,732 --> 01:26:47,929
And I wanted both of you
to pay for my mistakes.

1095
01:26:50,171 --> 01:26:54,972
You can be mad at me if you want.
And tell him I'm sorry.

1096
01:26:57,178 --> 01:27:00,045
He's not even angry with you.

1097
01:27:00,114 --> 01:27:02,412
He's ready to forgive you.

1098
01:27:11,726 --> 01:27:14,320
I might need a little time.

1099
01:28:19,694 --> 01:28:21,662
(music) I can wait, I can wait

1100
01:28:21,729 --> 01:28:24,960
(music) I can sit wondering what in the world

1101
01:28:25,033 --> 01:28:27,558
(music) You think about

1102
01:28:27,635 --> 01:28:31,503
(music) I don't think
I'm ever gonna figure it out

1103
01:28:31,572 --> 01:28:33,938
(music) After all the alcohol

1104
01:28:34,008 --> 01:28:36,977
(music) The pretty words
that devolve down to slurs

1105
01:28:37,045 --> 01:28:40,139
(music) And drunken shouts

1106
01:28:40,214 --> 01:28:43,547
(music) I don't think I'm ever gonna figure it out

1107
01:28:44,886 --> 01:28:48,788
(music) Like some wild last frontier

1108
01:28:48,856 --> 01:28:52,223
(music) You never know what kind of fight's
goin' on up here

1109
01:28:52,293 --> 01:28:54,625
(music) Once begun, can't be won

1110
01:28:54,696 --> 01:28:57,722
(music) Started out losing already and go

1111
01:28:57,799 --> 01:29:00,529
(music) All ten rounds

1112
01:29:00,601 --> 01:29:04,731
(music) I don't think I'm ever gonna figure it out

1113
01:29:04,806 --> 01:29:08,708
(music) I don't think I'm ever gonna figure it out

1114
01:29:08,776 --> 01:29:13,270
(music) I don't think I'm ever gonna figure it out

1115
01:29:13,848 --> 01:29:15,941
It was good. Thank you.

1116
01:29:16,017 --> 01:29:17,917
You're welcome.

1117
01:29:17,985 --> 01:29:23,423
When my mom was too drunk to cook, I used to
take whatever was in the fridge and put it in a pot.

1118
01:29:28,062 --> 01:29:29,962
What's going on?

1119
01:29:31,399 --> 01:29:33,390
Same old thing.

1120
01:29:36,104 --> 01:29:39,301
Your mom called.
She wants to say good night.

1121
01:29:41,275 --> 01:29:43,869
I'm here, home, at Grandma's.

1122
01:29:44,545 --> 01:29:47,412
- Would you come over?
- No.

1123
01:29:48,015 --> 01:29:49,448
OK.

1124
01:29:50,818 --> 01:29:52,308
Well, good night, then.

1125
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:55,049
Please come back to San Francisco.

1126
01:29:56,157 --> 01:29:58,284
No, Mom, not right now.

1127
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:02,896
We can't leave it like this.
We have to talk.

1128
01:30:02,964 --> 01:30:06,024
Can you call me in the morning?

1129
01:30:06,768 --> 01:30:08,998
Yeah, OK.

1130
01:30:10,671 --> 01:30:11,729
OK.

1131
01:30:11,806 --> 01:30:13,831
OK.

1132
01:30:14,442 --> 01:30:16,501
- Goodbye.
- (dial tone)

1133
01:30:25,486 --> 01:30:29,445
(music) Across an ocean of tears

1134
01:30:29,524 --> 01:30:33,119
(music) For a bottle of sand

1135
01:30:33,194 --> 01:30:36,925
(music) I shut my eyes and my ears

1136
01:30:36,998 --> 01:30:39,432
(music) And never reach dry land

1137
01:30:41,035 --> 01:30:43,731
(music) Another day in the trenches

1138
01:30:44,939 --> 01:30:47,669
(music) Here for the fight

1139
01:30:47,742 --> 01:30:53,612
(music) In these days of darkness
in the Great Divide

1140
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:58,142
(music) No one else sees the story

1141
01:30:58,219 --> 01:31:01,814
(music) All the pain you had

1142
01:31:03,558 --> 01:31:07,255
(music) Too late to run...

1143
01:31:07,328 --> 01:31:11,992
(music) Someone reached in
and healed a broken sky

1144
01:31:12,066 --> 01:31:14,364
You need help, Rachel.

1145
01:31:15,403 --> 01:31:17,337
That's why I'm here.

1146
01:31:17,405 --> 01:31:20,772
You nearly destroyed your mother
with all this, you know.

1147
01:31:20,842 --> 01:31:22,537
I'll pay for your therapy.

1148
01:31:22,610 --> 01:31:24,840
Too late.

1149
01:31:24,912 --> 01:31:32,512
All right, I'll tell you what. I'll leave my Ferrari here,
we'll drive your mother's car back to San Francisco,

1150
01:31:32,587 --> 01:31:37,217
and you can have mine for telling her the truth.
How's that sound?

1151
01:31:38,426 --> 01:31:40,690
I'm uncomfortable with you in my room.

1152
01:31:40,761 --> 01:31:43,525
(man on TV) And Gonzales
will have himself a base hit.

1153
01:31:43,598 --> 01:31:45,657
As Garrett Randall steps in...

1154
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:49,303
OK, here's the deal.

1155
01:31:50,037 --> 01:31:55,168
If Mom goes back with you, loves being with you,
can't live without you, blah... blah... blah,

1156
01:31:55,243 --> 01:31:57,268
then that's the end of it.

1157
01:31:57,345 --> 01:31:58,835
That's the plan?

1158
01:31:58,913 --> 01:32:04,078
Well, if she decides that I'm lying about lying,
then you owe me.

1159
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:07,911
Owe you what?

1160
01:32:10,691 --> 01:32:13,353
- I'm not gonna take you to court or anything.
- Oh...

1161
01:32:13,427 --> 01:32:16,419
I won't sue you. No newspapers.

1162
01:32:17,031 --> 01:32:20,797
Just write her a letter
saying you're sorry about what you did to me.

1163
01:32:20,868 --> 01:32:23,769
- That's it, huh?
- And a check for ten million.

1164
01:32:24,238 --> 01:32:28,402
Hmm. Oh. Right. That. Of course.

1165
01:32:28,476 --> 01:32:33,778
You always bragged about how much you were
worth while we had our "father... daughter time."

1166
01:32:33,848 --> 01:32:36,840
Like that would impress me enough
to think it was all OK.

1167
01:32:36,918 --> 01:32:40,319
I really hope you weren't lying.
I hope you're worth 20 million.

1168
01:32:40,388 --> 01:32:44,757
Because if she decides you're a piece of shit,
which you are, she gets ten.

1169
01:32:46,127 --> 01:32:47,924
OK.

1170
01:32:48,329 --> 01:32:50,695
I'll see you in court.

1171
01:32:53,467 --> 01:32:56,027
Along with the videotape.

1172
01:32:57,238 --> 01:32:59,297
What are you talking about?

1173
01:33:01,475 --> 01:33:05,844
- You know, I hate this smell.
- What are you talking about?

1174
01:33:05,913 --> 01:33:09,371
Remember Tommy?
The one that stuck the gun to your head?

1175
01:33:09,450 --> 01:33:12,248
What are you, wired?
You have a tape on, is that it?

1176
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:14,720
No, nothing. Honest.

1177
01:33:16,524 --> 01:33:19,425
All right, that's enough, Rachel.

1178
01:33:22,964 --> 01:33:27,526
The thing is, I had him record us.
He has a videotape of us.

1179
01:33:27,602 --> 01:33:29,467
Oh, really?

1180
01:33:29,537 --> 01:33:35,134
You, you're all sweaty and grunting and pushing.
And me, I'm 14.

1181
01:33:35,776 --> 01:33:37,471
Right.

1182
01:33:38,045 --> 01:33:44,075
Look, as long as my mother's happy,
you win everything. I won't even hold it against you.

1183
01:33:44,919 --> 01:33:47,217
- Keep my mother happy, OK?
- OK.

1184
01:33:57,832 --> 01:33:59,595
You were thinking?

1185
01:33:59,667 --> 01:34:01,464
I have a little money saved.

1186
01:34:01,535 --> 01:34:07,201
I'd be glad to pay Rachel's way through college,
you know, if that's ever a problem.

1187
01:34:08,275 --> 01:34:10,903
Or if she doesn't need it,
I could let you have it.

1188
01:34:10,978 --> 01:34:15,005
Use it for a down payment on a house,
if that's ever a problem.

1189
01:34:18,853 --> 01:34:21,822
Mom, I'm leaving in the morning with Arnold.

1190
01:34:28,295 --> 01:34:30,286
Thank you.

1191
01:35:31,459 --> 01:35:32,551
(sighs)

1192
01:35:37,398 --> 01:35:39,593
Go back to the couch.

1193
01:35:40,167 --> 01:35:42,260
I love you.

1194
01:35:44,872 --> 01:35:47,067
- Please, Simon.
- No.

1195
01:35:48,509 --> 01:35:50,909
It's not like you're family.

1196
01:35:50,978 --> 01:35:54,106
I'm never gonna have sex with you,
all right? Ever.

1197
01:35:54,181 --> 01:35:56,308
No.

1198
01:35:56,383 --> 01:36:00,615
It's not like I haven't thought about it.
You know, it's hard not to.

1199
01:36:00,688 --> 01:36:04,146
You're good at it, this attracting men thing.

1200
01:36:04,225 --> 01:36:07,820
And you're beautiful and funny and bright.
Goddamn him for this!

1201
01:36:07,895 --> 01:36:09,624
This has nothing to do with him.

1202
01:36:09,697 --> 01:36:13,827
He tried to take away all the things
that would let you love me like a friend or a father.

1203
01:36:13,901 --> 01:36:16,699
This has everything to do with him.

1204
01:36:19,540 --> 01:36:25,843
This is about knowing the difference between
right and wrong, between the truth and a lie.

1205
01:36:25,913 --> 01:36:28,177
He took that from you.

1206
01:36:28,249 --> 01:36:32,185
And if you can't tell the difference,
then you can't trust anyone.

1207
01:36:34,789 --> 01:36:37,349
And if you can't trust, you can't love.

1208
01:36:41,896 --> 01:36:44,797
What's it like to be so sure of yourself?

1209
01:36:44,865 --> 01:36:46,958
It's good.

1210
01:36:51,572 --> 01:36:53,938
Tell me about your wife.

1211
01:36:54,008 --> 01:36:56,101
Describe it for me.

1212
01:37:00,681 --> 01:37:02,342
Describe what?

1213
01:37:03,751 --> 01:37:05,912
How you loved her.

1214
01:37:07,221 --> 01:37:12,989
When I touched her,
I felt the best part of me being touched.

1215
01:37:15,930 --> 01:37:19,024
It's just a different kind of love, Rachel.

1216
01:37:19,867 --> 01:37:22,734
Do you think you'll ever have it again?

1217
01:37:23,904 --> 01:37:25,371
No.

1218
01:37:26,407 --> 01:37:28,500
Maybe. I don't know.

1219
01:37:29,677 --> 01:37:31,508
Maybe.

1220
01:37:33,814 --> 01:37:36,612
Thanks. For saying no.

1221
01:37:43,090 --> 01:37:45,718
(dog barking)

1222
01:37:54,101 --> 01:37:56,035
Where's your car?

1223
01:37:56,103 --> 01:37:58,071
Around the corner.

1224
01:37:58,806 --> 01:38:00,535
For safety reasons.

1225
01:38:02,443 --> 01:38:06,072
If I could lock the windows and doors
and keep her from you, I would.

1226
01:38:06,146 --> 01:38:08,239
I'll wait for her right here.

1227
01:38:13,921 --> 01:38:16,014
You know I know.

1228
01:38:16,090 --> 01:38:18,558
Come on, Georgia.

1229
01:38:18,993 --> 01:38:23,555
I don't care what Rachel says. I know.
And that must eat at you.

1230
01:38:24,732 --> 01:38:27,826
Having something that disgusting, criminal,

1231
01:38:28,702 --> 01:38:31,762
known out here, exposed,
out in the open.

1232
01:38:34,408 --> 01:38:39,471
If my daughter wasn't in love with you,
I would kill you.

1233
01:38:44,818 --> 01:38:48,754
I've been calling Rachel for over an hour.
It's still busy.

1234
01:38:48,822 --> 01:38:50,653
Thank you.

1235
01:38:50,724 --> 01:38:56,822
Would you give this to her? I didn't seal it.
You can read it if you want to.

1236
01:39:01,201 --> 01:39:03,431
I don't want you to go.

1237
01:39:10,044 --> 01:39:12,376
I'll call you when I get home.

1238
01:39:12,446 --> 01:39:15,677
I noticed the glass bedpan on your mantel.

1239
01:39:16,283 --> 01:39:18,342
Yeah, I found room for it.

1240
01:39:18,919 --> 01:39:20,477
Thank you.

1241
01:39:33,367 --> 01:39:35,494
Hey, boys.

1242
01:39:35,569 --> 01:39:37,901
Come say goodbye to Lilly.

1243
01:39:40,574 --> 01:39:42,132
- Bye.
- Bye, Lilly.

1244
01:39:42,209 --> 01:39:44,837
Goodbye. Goodbye.

1245
01:39:53,220 --> 01:39:54,983
(starts engine)

1246
01:40:10,137 --> 01:40:12,264
(knock on door)

1247
01:40:12,339 --> 01:40:14,705
- Who is it?
- (knocking)

1248
01:40:14,775 --> 01:40:16,834
Coming.

1249
01:40:19,913 --> 01:40:22,746
Why didn't you answer the phone?

1250
01:40:22,816 --> 01:40:24,647
I just woke up.

1251
01:40:24,718 --> 01:40:28,154
Simon's at work already.
Did they leave yet?

1252
01:40:31,658 --> 01:40:34,752
I thought I could let it go, but I can't.

1253
01:40:34,828 --> 01:40:37,422
Rachel, you lied to her.

1254
01:40:38,632 --> 01:40:42,466
I put together a puzzle
without looking at the box.

1255
01:40:42,536 --> 01:40:44,265
- Look at me.
- Why?

1256
01:40:44,338 --> 01:40:47,364
Look at me. You have to tell her the truth.

1257
01:40:48,442 --> 01:40:52,606
Simon says I don't know the difference
between the truth and a lie.

1258
01:40:52,679 --> 01:40:55,648
- Can a lie ever be right?
- No.

1259
01:40:57,217 --> 01:40:59,378
And what happens if I tell the truth?

1260
01:40:59,953 --> 01:41:02,444
We're gonna press criminal charges.

1261
01:41:02,523 --> 01:41:05,515
But it's gonna take the three of us.
Come on, get dressed.

1262
01:41:05,592 --> 01:41:08,425
- What makes you think we'll catch them?
- Well, we'll try.

1263
01:41:08,495 --> 01:41:11,328
Simon and Harlan are in the truck.
She gave me this for you.

1264
01:41:11,398 --> 01:41:13,593
- No, no. Go get dressed.
- OK.

1265
01:41:13,667 --> 01:41:15,464
You can read this on the way. Hurry.

1266
01:41:15,536 --> 01:41:20,564
- What makes you think she'll believe me now?
- We'll make her, you and I.

1267
01:41:24,044 --> 01:41:25,272
(door closes)

1268
01:41:25,379 --> 01:41:26,038
(honking horn)

1269
01:41:30,551 --> 01:41:35,750
- Maybe I should've driven myself.
- Then I would've been tailgating you.

1270
01:41:37,858 --> 01:41:39,291
(horn blares)

1271
01:41:40,394 --> 01:41:42,419
What's your hurry?

1272
01:41:47,367 --> 01:41:50,928
Sending someone back
for your car is ridiculous.

1273
01:41:51,004 --> 01:41:54,940
I might not even do that.
It's all too much trouble.

1274
01:41:55,542 --> 01:41:59,034
Can't leave your car parked
on some side street in Idaho.

1275
01:41:59,113 --> 01:42:03,777
Pull over. You know you want to.
It's the right thing to do.

1276
01:42:05,152 --> 01:42:07,484
Rachel can have it if she wants.

1277
01:42:09,523 --> 01:42:11,047
- Rachel?
- Mm... hmm.

1278
01:42:12,793 --> 01:42:17,355
You love that car.
You waited eight months for that car.

1279
01:42:17,431 --> 01:42:22,459
I don't hold any of this against her, honey.
I want her to know that.

1280
01:42:23,137 --> 01:42:26,436
(honks horn)

1281
01:42:26,507 --> 01:42:29,237
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

1282
01:42:34,148 --> 01:42:36,116
Pull over.

1283
01:42:36,183 --> 01:42:39,243
What? What's the matter?
You sick or something?

1284
01:42:39,319 --> 01:42:42,880
Did you think your Ferrari
would be payment enough for her?

1285
01:42:42,956 --> 01:42:47,086
- What? That's not what this is about.
- Get me outta here. Pull over.

1286
01:42:47,161 --> 01:42:50,790
- Come on, honey. Please.
- Pull over right now!

1287
01:42:50,864 --> 01:42:53,264
All right, all right! I'm off. Stop it!

1288
01:42:53,333 --> 01:42:59,795
Honey, stop. Lilly, stop it!
All right, I'm doing it! I'm pulling over!

1289
01:43:06,413 --> 01:43:08,381
Goddammit, Lilly.

1290
01:43:09,283 --> 01:43:10,910
Talk to me.

1291
01:43:12,553 --> 01:43:14,851
Will you please turn around?

1292
01:43:16,089 --> 01:43:18,387
Turn around!

1293
01:43:19,026 --> 01:43:21,551
All right, fine. Keep walking.

1294
01:43:24,798 --> 01:43:26,823
There's your life.

1295
01:43:26,900 --> 01:43:30,301
Back in Idaho. With your mother.

1296
01:43:37,010 --> 01:43:39,069
She seduced me.

1297
01:43:46,186 --> 01:43:47,778
(screams)

1298
01:43:47,854 --> 01:43:49,481
Naah!

1299
01:43:51,458 --> 01:43:53,119
You lying son of a bitch!

1300
01:43:53,193 --> 01:43:57,527
What did you expect me to do
while you were in your drunken stupor?

1301
01:43:57,598 --> 01:43:59,259
And guess what.

1302
01:43:59,333 --> 01:44:01,096
She enjoyed it.

1303
01:44:04,671 --> 01:44:09,973
You wanna take this to trial?
You go right ahead. I welcome it.

1304
01:44:10,043 --> 01:44:13,410
You're going to jail, you sick bastard.

1305
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:15,471
(starts engine)

1306
01:44:18,785 --> 01:44:21,447
You can bet on it, pervert.

1307
01:44:32,833 --> 01:44:40,035
"Dear Rachel, my mother always told me the
hardest things to do in life are to trust, to have faith,

1308
01:44:40,107 --> 01:44:42,268
and to forgive."

1309
01:44:42,909 --> 01:44:48,404
"So I want you to hear the strength in my voice
when I say I forgive you,

1310
01:44:48,482 --> 01:44:50,814
because I love you."

1311
01:44:50,884 --> 01:44:53,478
"That simple and that complicated."

1312
01:44:53,553 --> 01:44:59,116
"To forgive is to move forward.
Georgia rule. Love, Mom."

1313
01:45:46,073 --> 01:45:48,268
I'm sorry, Mommy.

1314
01:45:49,643 --> 01:45:52,237
Oh, bunny. Oh, bunny.

1315
01:45:53,847 --> 01:45:55,940
I love you.

1316
01:45:59,286 --> 01:46:01,345
I'm so sorry.

1317
01:46:06,193 --> 01:46:08,559
Ms. Randall.

1318
01:46:08,628 --> 01:46:12,758
I think you should know
that I'm in love with your granddaughter.

1319
01:46:12,833 --> 01:46:18,430
And, well, when I get back from my mission,
I fully intend to marry her.

1320
01:46:18,505 --> 01:46:20,234
OK.

1321
01:46:40,694 --> 01:46:43,094
(music) Where you're going

1322
01:46:43,163 --> 01:46:46,257
(music) No one knows and

1323
01:46:46,333 --> 01:46:48,494
(music) Strangers in you

1324
01:46:48,568 --> 01:46:51,867
(music) Will guide you through and

1325
01:46:51,938 --> 01:46:54,372
(music) What you know and

1326
01:46:54,441 --> 01:46:57,501
(music) No one goes there

1327
01:46:57,577 --> 01:47:02,071
(music) Strangers in you will take you to it

1328
01:47:02,149 --> 01:47:07,416
(music)And we listen low to the voice of the wind

1329
01:47:07,487 --> 01:47:12,652
(music) And we come to the place
that is waiting there within

1330
01:47:12,726 --> 01:47:18,596
(music) And if you channel the wind,
and you put it in a song

1331
01:47:18,665 --> 01:47:27,972
(music) It will carry us all, it will carry us all

1332
01:47:28,041 --> 01:47:30,475
(music) And it goes on

1333
01:47:31,978 --> 01:47:38,816
(music) Ooh... ooh

1334
01:47:39,719 --> 01:47:41,710
((music) "Extraordinary" by Mandy Moore)

1335
01:47:42,689 --> 01:47:45,180
(music) I was a bay tree

1336
01:47:45,258 --> 01:47:47,852
(music) Quiet and unseen

1337
01:47:47,928 --> 01:47:53,025
(music) I lived in stories, but inside,
I kept a mystery

1338
01:47:53,099 --> 01:47:55,795
(music) I was a starling

1339
01:47:55,869 --> 01:47:58,463
(music) Nobody's darling

1340
01:47:58,538 --> 01:48:03,805
(music) Flying in perfect circles
just for company

1341
01:48:03,877 --> 01:48:06,277
(music) And now I'm ready

1342
01:48:06,346 --> 01:48:09,042
(music) And now I'm ready

1343
01:48:09,115 --> 01:48:15,384
(music) And now I'm ready to be extraordinary

1344
01:48:24,831 --> 01:48:27,425
(music) A midnight airplane

1345
01:48:27,501 --> 01:48:30,163
(music) A window blowing

1346
01:48:30,237 --> 01:48:35,539
(music) I know I am another sparkle in the sky

1347
01:48:35,609 --> 01:48:37,975
(music) I shine on copper

1348
01:48:38,044 --> 01:48:40,672
(music) Still undiscovered

1349
01:48:40,747 --> 01:48:46,014
(music) But you must see me
in the corner of your eye

1350
01:48:46,086 --> 01:48:48,714
(music)And now I'm ready

1351
01:48:48,788 --> 01:48:51,382
(music) And now I'm ready

1352
01:48:51,458 --> 01:48:57,954
(music) And now I'm ready to be extraordinary

1353
01:49:07,307 --> 01:49:12,438
(music) Waking up to wake up someday

1354
01:49:12,512 --> 01:49:16,175
(music) I am my own prey

1355
01:49:17,684 --> 01:49:22,621
(music) Stopping off at a sidewalk cafe

1356
01:49:22,689 --> 01:49:25,157
(music) Wind is playing in the trees

1357
01:49:25,225 --> 01:49:27,853
(music) Kicking up confetti leaves

1358
01:49:27,928 --> 01:49:31,887
(music) Seems as if it's all to say

1359
01:49:33,633 --> 01:49:36,193
(music) And now I'm ready

1360
01:49:36,269 --> 01:49:38,829
(music) Yeah, now I'm ready

1361
01:49:38,905 --> 01:49:44,172
(music) And now I'm ready to be

1362
01:49:44,244 --> 01:49:46,769
(music) And now I'm ready

1363
01:49:46,846 --> 01:49:49,440
(music) And now I'm ready

1364
01:49:49,516 --> 01:49:56,718
(music) And now I'm ready to be extraordinary

1365
01:49:58,091 --> 01:50:01,754
(music) Extraordinary
