1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,832
Cain and Abel

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,832
Episode 19

3
00:00:06,794 --> 00:00:12,428
<i>Did Sun Woo oppa's tumor get worse?</i>

4
00:00:30,367 --> 00:00:31,691
<i>Lee Sun Woo,</i>

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,291
just tell me you're sorry,

6
00:00:35,406 --> 00:00:36,553
that you made a mistake.

7
00:00:36,706 --> 00:00:38,046
Just say that one thing.

8
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:41,473
Then, we can turn everything back.

9
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,257
Because I wanted to be
Lee Sun Woo's little brother,

10
00:00:45,465 --> 00:00:51,252
Lee Jong Min's child,
and Na Hye Joo's son.

11
00:00:51,755 --> 00:00:52,964
Sun Woo hyung.

12
00:00:53,132 --> 00:00:55,241
"Cho In... "

13
00:00:55,756 --> 00:00:57,744
"my little brother,"

14
00:00:57,933 --> 00:00:59,843
"I'm sorry."

15
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,484
Just say that one thing for me.

16
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:04,726
Just that one thing.

17
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:07,230
No.

18
00:01:07,966 --> 00:01:10,521
I can't say it.

19
00:01:12,067 --> 00:01:18,480
Because my little brother Lee Cho In
already died in China.

20
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:27,700
Episode 19

21
00:01:53,076 --> 00:01:55,368
Since when was it?

22
00:01:55,522 --> 00:01:59,855
When did Lee Sun Woo
develop a tumor?

23
00:02:00,088 --> 00:02:01,500
He said he relapsed.

24
00:02:03,732 --> 00:02:04,971
What?

25
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,115
Seven years ago when he cut off contact in America,

26
00:02:09,336 --> 00:02:13,148
that's when they first discovered it.

27
00:02:18,368 --> 00:02:21,421
<i>I wanted to get acknowledgement from Father.</i>

28
00:02:21,692 --> 00:02:25,319
<i>I wanted to fix the heart of the girl I loved.</i>

29
00:02:25,504 --> 00:02:29,444
<i>I gave up on my previous
specialty of thoracic surgery</i>

30
00:02:29,535 --> 00:02:31,765
<i>and transferred to neurology.</i>

31
00:02:31,937 --> 00:02:33,194
<i>A mother's embrace...</i>

32
00:02:33,388 --> 00:02:35,404
<i>I, not ever having experienced it, I too...</i>

33
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:37,275
I too lived.

34
00:02:37,397 --> 00:02:41,299
The things I can't have
no matter how hard I tried,

35
00:02:42,602 --> 00:02:44,900
you got them way too easily.

36
00:02:46,601 --> 00:02:48,487
<i>"My little brother," </i>

37
00:02:48,858 --> 00:02:49,840
<i>"I'm sorry." </i>

38
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,000
<i>Say it for me!</i>

39
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:19,647
You can send the results of the test
immediately through PACS, right?

40
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:20,631
Yes.

41
00:03:19,648 --> 00:03:23,900
{\a6}PACS = Imaging storage and transmission system
that connects all medical images in the hospital.

42
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,500
What are you doing?

43
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,000
Director...

44
00:03:29,387 --> 00:03:31,400
Who told you to do this?

45
00:03:34,095 --> 00:03:37,276
Who told you to take a CT of my brain?

46
00:03:37,386 --> 00:03:39,423
You were brought to the Emergency Room,

47
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:42,617
so Dr. Lee Cho In ordered it.

48
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,200
[Lee Sun Woo]

49
00:03:53,248 --> 00:03:55,552
Delete the results.

50
00:03:55,793 --> 00:03:56,968
Excuse me?

51
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:04,809
Delete the results immediately
and don't upload it onto PACS.

52
00:04:05,263 --> 00:04:08,039
Don't you hear me?

53
00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:10,713
Delete it immediately!

54
00:04:10,975 --> 00:04:14,042
Ah, yes.

55
00:04:27,721 --> 00:04:30,210
Dr. Shin Sang Su,

56
00:04:31,076 --> 00:04:36,520
don't tell anyone about
what happened today.

57
00:04:36,715 --> 00:04:40,665
That includes Cho In and everyone else.

58
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,027
Do you understand?

59
00:04:43,292 --> 00:04:47,405
Y... yes, I understand.

60
00:04:55,092 --> 00:04:57,687
Dr. Shin, is it really okay to delete it?

61
00:04:57,767 --> 00:04:59,293
Won't it become a problem then?

62
00:04:59,398 --> 00:05:02,405
He himself wants it deleted.

63
00:05:28,724 --> 00:05:38,347
Cho In, can't you treat Sun Woo oppa?

64
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,802
Kim Seo Yeon,

65
00:05:41,835 --> 00:05:47,336
you know what Lee Sun Woo did to me,

66
00:05:47,552 --> 00:05:49,768
so how can you ask me that?

67
00:05:49,831 --> 00:05:51,754
<i>But what can we do?</i>

68
00:05:51,922 --> 00:05:55,446
He's your hyung, and your family.

69
00:05:55,626 --> 00:05:59,720
He's the hyung you lived
with for over 30 years.

70
00:05:59,905 --> 00:06:01,497
<i>No...</i>

71
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:06,514
I don't have anything like an older brother.

72
00:06:11,624 --> 00:06:16,143
Then, are you going to let
Sun Woo oppa die like that?

73
00:06:16,377 --> 00:06:19,334
Lee Cho In, can you do that?

74
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,138
Can you?

75
00:06:21,377 --> 00:06:22,997
Why?

76
00:06:23,346 --> 00:06:26,210
You think I can't?

77
00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:47,475
Oppa, are you okay?

78
00:06:47,627 --> 00:06:49,873
<i>Are you okay?</i>

79
00:06:50,257 --> 00:06:51,843
What about the CT?

80
00:06:52,057 --> 00:06:54,346
The results are probably out.

81
00:06:54,518 --> 00:06:57,100
Should we go look together?

82
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:02,760
Kim Seo Yeon, you can go back now.

83
00:07:06,223 --> 00:07:07,381
<i>Lee Sun Woo,</i>

84
00:07:07,563 --> 00:07:10,598
I told you not to do this to me.

85
00:07:11,114 --> 00:07:13,209
Lee Sun Woo...

86
00:07:15,565 --> 00:07:17,617
<i>Lee Sun Woo!</i>

87
00:07:59,268 --> 00:08:02,084
This can't be.

88
00:08:02,557 --> 00:08:05,873
How can it in that amount of time?

89
00:08:57,009 --> 00:08:58,964
Director Lee Sun Woo said to delete them,

90
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,067
but due to the hospital's regulations,

91
00:09:01,195 --> 00:09:03,890
I left them on the hard drive.

92
00:09:11,178 --> 00:09:13,426
Lee Sun Woo.

93
00:09:23,226 --> 00:09:25,211
<i>Father...</i>

94
00:09:25,718 --> 00:09:28,747
did you know?

95
00:09:29,229 --> 00:09:34,828
Lee Sun Woo is sick.

96
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:37,309
<i>With a straight face,</i>

97
00:09:37,599 --> 00:09:40,834
he tried to kill me,

98
00:09:41,106 --> 00:09:44,240
and now he says he's sick.

99
00:09:46,422 --> 00:09:49,811
If he tried to kill his brother,

100
00:09:50,046 --> 00:09:52,782
he shouldn't be sick

101
00:09:52,946 --> 00:09:56,406
and live until the end.

102
00:10:37,884 --> 00:10:40,974
<i>Young Ji, why would you be bad?</i>

103
00:10:41,121 --> 00:10:44,928
<i>I'm so grateful for you.</i>

104
00:10:45,154 --> 00:10:46,724
Do you like it?

105
00:10:53,989 --> 00:10:55,866
Doctor.

106
00:10:56,157 --> 00:10:58,916
Young Ji, what are you doing?

107
00:10:59,385 --> 00:11:01,884
With the make up you
gave me in Cheong Ju,

108
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:05,306
I was giving myself a massage.

109
00:11:05,508 --> 00:11:09,918
Young Ji, do you want
to see this hospital fail?

110
00:11:10,074 --> 00:11:11,552
What do you mean?

111
00:11:11,719 --> 00:11:13,573
I mean,

112
00:11:13,608 --> 00:11:16,911
without massages, there's a rumor
saying how pretty you are,

113
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:19,296
<i>so all the young doctors are drooling.</i>

114
00:11:19,403 --> 00:11:21,859
If you do massages and get prettier,

115
00:11:21,918 --> 00:11:23,343
what are you going to do then?

116
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:25,212
<i>Huh?</i>

117
00:11:26,276 --> 00:11:28,914
Don't do that.

118
00:11:30,542 --> 00:11:32,598
What's this?

119
00:11:32,778 --> 00:11:35,964
It's a notebook.

120
00:11:36,105 --> 00:11:37,871
A notebook?

121
00:11:37,967 --> 00:11:41,666
I think Father didn't like that notebook.

122
00:11:41,881 --> 00:11:44,743
He threw it and broke it.

123
00:11:44,822 --> 00:11:48,933
Wow! Did he get better that fast?

124
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:54,616
Young Ji, sometimes when I look at you,
you really seem stupid.

125
00:11:55,219 --> 00:11:56,603
<i>You're so cute.</i>

126
00:11:56,823 --> 00:11:59,025
Don't do that.

127
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:03,244
Young Ji, please take it to his room.

128
00:12:03,996 --> 00:12:05,085
It's a request.

129
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,497
Don't worry.

130
00:12:06,528 --> 00:12:12,256
I'll explain to your father
about this computer.

131
00:12:13,312 --> 00:12:15,975
Oh, there's something on your face.

132
00:12:16,086 --> 00:12:19,108
<i>Close your eyes.</i>

133
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:28,874
I'll get going.

134
00:12:39,224 --> 00:12:41,734
Let's go together.
This is nice.

135
00:12:41,849 --> 00:12:43,357
What about people?

136
00:12:43,465 --> 00:12:45,073
So what if others see?

137
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,434
A lot of younger people link arms now.

138
00:12:49,357 --> 00:12:52,562
Oh, who's this?
Lee Cho In.

139
00:12:52,796 --> 00:12:55,858
Emergency Center founding director,

140
00:12:55,951 --> 00:12:57,382
Director Kim Hyun Joo.

141
00:12:57,597 --> 00:12:59,921
Dr. Lee Cho In.

142
00:13:00,326 --> 00:13:02,933
Okay.
Let's hug.

143
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,324
I heard the detectives that
you were cleared of the charges.

144
00:13:08,481 --> 00:13:09,284
<i>I was worried.</i>

145
00:13:09,377 --> 00:13:11,725
Congratulations.

146
00:13:13,935 --> 00:13:16,716
Thank you for believing in me.

147
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,816
My arms are about to fall off.

148
00:13:19,011 --> 00:13:20,040
Let's hug.

149
00:13:20,126 --> 00:13:21,295
Good work.

150
00:13:21,653 --> 00:13:22,842
Good work.

151
00:13:23,043 --> 00:13:25,912
Oh, Jin Keun sunbae,
did you drink?

152
00:13:26,094 --> 00:13:27,614
How can I not drink?

153
00:13:27,823 --> 00:13:30,300
Hey, the Emergency Center
was decided upon,

154
00:13:30,301 --> 00:13:32,100
and you were cleared of charges,
so I had to drink.

155
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,212
Do I smell a lot?

156
00:13:34,566 --> 00:13:37,022
There are a lot of troubles ahead, Chief

157
00:13:37,261 --> 00:13:39,217
...no, Director.

158
00:13:39,386 --> 00:13:41,483
Yeah, there's so much to do.

159
00:13:41,658 --> 00:13:43,792
It looks like a thorny path from the start.

160
00:13:43,914 --> 00:13:47,677
Now what is a thorny path?
It's all done. Why are you fussing?

161
00:13:47,806 --> 00:13:51,192
The decision made by the board
hasn't officially been announced yet.

162
00:13:51,306 --> 00:13:53,918
They're going to start the
Neurology Center somehow,

163
00:13:54,109 --> 00:13:58,929
so the Vice President is holding
this decision until the next meeting.

164
00:13:59,100 --> 00:13:59,869
Oh.

165
00:13:59,947 --> 00:14:01,800
I'll take care of that,

166
00:14:01,985 --> 00:14:07,217
So, Director, can you make the decision for
the center's first day and the blueprint?

167
00:14:07,321 --> 00:14:10,513
Well, that's something I've always
talked to the President about,

168
00:14:10,693 --> 00:14:12,370
so that's no problem.

169
00:14:12,535 --> 00:14:15,661
Okay, let's start from there.

170
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:18,386
Then, please take care of this request.

171
00:14:18,387 --> 00:14:19,787
Okay. See you later.

172
00:14:19,922 --> 00:14:21,900
Work hard.

173
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:38,784
Father, try moving it.

174
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:42,721
<i>What do you think?</i>

175
00:14:42,898 --> 00:14:46,897
Don't you think this computer is
more comfortable than the other one?

176
00:14:47,036 --> 00:14:50,391
I'll also tell you the steps for writing.

177
00:14:50,597 --> 00:14:53,624
Then, try using it once.

178
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,925
[Oh Young Ji]

179
00:15:05,932 --> 00:15:12,239
Father...,
you still remembered my name?

180
00:15:15,105 --> 00:15:16,429
Thank you.

181
00:15:16,527 --> 00:15:18,807
Thank you very much.

182
00:15:19,445 --> 00:15:25,034
Now,  try writing what you want to write.

183
00:15:29,526 --> 00:15:33,595
[Miss Oh Young Ji right now]

184
00:15:43,131 --> 00:15:46,205
[the letter I'm writing...]

185
00:15:55,531 --> 00:15:56,925
Vice President.

186
00:15:57,196 --> 00:16:00,983
What is it that you have to say
about Dr. Lee Sun Woo?

187
00:16:01,204 --> 00:16:03,052
I'm sure you already know,

188
00:16:03,153 --> 00:16:07,080
Dr. Lee Sun Woo's condition
is very bad right now.

189
00:16:12,202 --> 00:16:13,544
Sun Woo...

190
00:16:13,744 --> 00:16:15,649
<i>To tell you the truth,</i>

191
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:21,532
<i>the linear accelerator we used last time
caused reverse effect only.</i>

192
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:21,433
{\a6}linear accelerator = a high tech cancer treatment using
the energy from accelerating an electron

193
00:16:21,786 --> 00:16:23,457
<i>If we just leave him like this,</i>

194
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:25,115
<i>curing him is definite,</i>

195
00:16:25,396 --> 00:16:28,652
<i>though whether it be a month or a week,</i>

196
00:16:28,802 --> 00:16:32,082
no one can know how long he'll have to live.

197
00:16:34,988 --> 00:16:37,084
Then,

198
00:16:38,547 --> 00:16:41,422
what do you think we should do?

199
00:16:41,786 --> 00:16:44,605
We should perform surgery
right away and extract the tumor

200
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:48,443
and have him go through chemotherapy.

201
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:52,917
Then will that save Sun Woo?

202
00:16:53,117 --> 00:16:58,995
No, it'll prevent him
from getting worse.

203
00:16:59,116 --> 00:17:06,351
Even if we do surgery,
he'll live for at most two years.

204
00:17:09,232 --> 00:17:12,271
He should do it, right?

205
00:17:15,249 --> 00:17:23,082
If we can have him live one more day,
he should get surgery, right?

206
00:17:23,297 --> 00:17:25,010
Yes.

207
00:17:25,255 --> 00:17:31,090
Do whatever you have to do
to save Sun Woo.

208
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,765
Do you understand?

209
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,664
Yes, I do.

210
00:17:53,709 --> 00:17:55,823
Why are you here?

211
00:17:56,024 --> 00:17:57,860
You're not even going to ask to me sit?

212
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:59,920
What do you want?

213
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,292
This is the list of equipment
for the emergency center.

214
00:18:06,521 --> 00:18:13,664
The decision the board made about
the Emergency Center, please announce it today.

215
00:18:13,931 --> 00:18:16,661
What do you mean do it?

216
00:18:18,449 --> 00:18:21,880
Did you just order me to do it?

217
00:18:22,093 --> 00:18:24,943
Did you hear it as an order?

218
00:18:25,109 --> 00:18:28,153
Then, you should follow it.

219
00:18:28,523 --> 00:18:29,855
What?

220
00:18:29,917 --> 00:18:31,592
And...

221
00:18:31,793 --> 00:18:33,679
Lee Sun Woo,

222
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,311
you should discharge him
from the hospital.

223
00:18:36,552 --> 00:18:38,826
What do you mean discharge?

224
00:18:38,926 --> 00:18:40,862
What are you saying right now?!

225
00:18:41,004 --> 00:18:44,579
For someone who has a grade 4
tumor to hold a scalpel,

226
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,873
don't you know what that means?

227
00:18:41,074 --> 00:18:47,774
{\a6}WHO grade 4 =  Classification for tumors is
from grade 1, benign, to grade 4, most malignant.

228
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:52,846
Someone who assisted with murder and
the person who murdered are the same!

229
00:18:54,228 --> 00:18:57,143
Wasn't enough to try to kill me?

230
00:18:57,368 --> 00:18:59,782
Who are you trying to kill now?

231
00:18:59,949 --> 00:19:07,053
No, Lee Sun Woo might die first.

232
00:19:07,481 --> 00:19:12,769
Lee Cho In, are you threatening me?

233
00:19:12,938 --> 00:19:18,525
Do you hear this as a threat?

234
00:19:22,044 --> 00:19:24,129
Alright.

235
00:19:25,584 --> 00:19:27,530
Tomorrow, I will contact the office
of the board of trustees.

236
00:19:27,607 --> 00:19:33,907
No, do it right now.

237
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:55,718
Connect me to the office
of the board of trustees.

238
00:19:56,717 --> 00:19:59,131
Director of the Board,
it's me, the Vice President.

239
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:04,406
Announce the decision
of the board right now.

240
00:20:08,168 --> 00:20:14,918
I will send you the organization of the
Emergency Center, so announce it together.

241
00:20:16,037 --> 00:20:17,796
Is that all?

242
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:22,870
No, it's just the start.

243
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:27,672
So, I'll be going.

244
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:33,808
There's someone waiting outside to meet you.

245
00:20:46,373 --> 00:20:48,872
General Manager,

246
00:20:52,905 --> 00:20:54,374
what is this?

247
00:20:54,591 --> 00:20:56,870
Director Lee Sun Woo,

248
00:20:57,082 --> 00:21:02,569
no ... he's just Doctor now, isn't he?

249
00:21:03,692 --> 00:21:09,213
It's an ethics committee meeting
for Dr. Lee Sun Woo.

250
00:21:11,516 --> 00:21:14,305
Ethics committee meeting?

251
00:21:22,921 --> 00:21:23,705
It's real!

252
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,858
It's real!

253
00:21:27,288 --> 00:21:29,202
The expansion of the Emergency Center.

254
00:21:29,439 --> 00:21:32,515
The Center's director is Chief Kim Hyun Joo.

255
00:22:01,846 --> 00:22:05,588
You're going to make Dr. Lee Sun Woo
stand in front of an ethics committee,

256
00:22:05,753 --> 00:22:08,253
and have a witch hunt right now?

257
00:22:08,437 --> 00:22:09,706
Vice President,

258
00:22:09,895 --> 00:22:14,114
I don't think this is a situation
you can cope with emotionally.

259
00:22:14,206 --> 00:22:15,470
What did you say?

260
00:22:15,549 --> 00:22:16,725
Since the case conference,

261
00:22:16,838 --> 00:22:19,077
you know that the number of patients
coming to the Neurology Center

262
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:21,038
has decreased tremendously, right?

263
00:22:21,158 --> 00:22:24,818
On top of that, the admitted patients
are saying they'll transfer hospitals,

264
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:27,715
and the number of patients
refusing treatment is increasing.

265
00:22:27,891 --> 00:22:29,085
If it continues like this,

266
00:22:29,221 --> 00:22:34,825
the Neurology Center that President Lee Jung Min
was insistent on making will collapse.

267
00:22:34,975 --> 00:22:36,850
Also,

268
00:22:37,044 --> 00:22:41,468
if Dr. Lee Sun Woo's sickness is found out,

269
00:22:41,637 --> 00:22:49,285
then you will have to take
the responsibility for that.

270
00:22:53,591 --> 00:23:00,577
Did Lee Cho In, that bastard,
tell you to say this?

271
00:23:00,716 --> 00:23:07,814
I'm asking if that bastard Lee Cho In
told you, General Manager, to tell me this!

272
00:23:08,015 --> 00:23:14,337
I'm the Consultation General Manager.

273
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:21,346
I know this much too, Vice President.

274
00:23:22,398 --> 00:23:24,421
Get out.

275
00:23:24,693 --> 00:23:29,202
Get out of my sight immediately.

276
00:23:29,447 --> 00:23:33,545
Then, have a good day.

277
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:52,244
How did my Sun Woo come this far.

278
00:23:52,966 --> 00:23:55,291
Do you know how he got here?

279
00:23:55,384 --> 00:23:57,745
Those bastards.

280
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:01,255
Those bastards.

281
00:24:08,665 --> 00:24:10,648
Are you not going to get ready
to treat the patients?

282
00:24:10,806 --> 00:24:12,370
Director,

283
00:24:12,507 --> 00:24:16,223
we want to continue working here
at the Bosung University Hospital,

284
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:18,260
but we no longer can.

285
00:24:18,494 --> 00:24:22,455
Dr. Nam Yong Tae,
what are you saying right now?

286
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:29,316
As you know Director, there are
no admitted patients as well as no outpatients.

287
00:24:29,572 --> 00:24:32,671
<i>We, the residents, want to
further our skills by seeing patients,</i>

288
00:24:32,825 --> 00:24:35,676
but we no longer have the chance to do that.

289
00:24:35,857 --> 00:24:36,947
On top of that,

290
00:24:37,165 --> 00:24:41,100
the Neurology Center has been cancelled.

291
00:24:41,473 --> 00:24:43,322
We're sorry,

292
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,001
but Director, make a decision.

293
00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:54,231
Are you telling me to give up the
Director's position and leave right now?

294
00:24:54,379 --> 00:24:57,199
If that's what it takes to save the patients
and our Neurology Center...

295
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,268
Did you just say "save the patients"?

296
00:25:00,478 --> 00:25:07,358
Do you think you have the talent
to tell me to make a decision?

297
00:25:07,596 --> 00:25:14,476
If you're going to disobey me,
do so after you have the talent to do so!

298
00:25:14,861 --> 00:25:18,390
Then, I'll take what you have
to say into consideration.

299
00:26:18,053 --> 00:26:23,354
<i>It's an ethics committee meeting request, Director.</i>

300
00:26:47,287 --> 00:26:58,851
Lee Cho In, are you trying
to take my doctor's license?

301
00:26:59,153 --> 00:27:01,007
Since you suddenly disappeared, Oh Young Ji,

302
00:27:01,185 --> 00:27:05,120
do you know how harsh the complaints
we got from the Chinese tourists were?

303
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:07,483
I'm sorry, Director.

304
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,096
At least Yang Dong Mi was
able to resolve the situation.

305
00:27:11,224 --> 00:27:13,795
<i>There could have been a big problem.</i>

306
00:27:13,941 --> 00:27:16,173
I'm very sorry.

307
00:27:16,356 --> 00:27:19,561
Since it's the first time,
I'll let it go with this.

308
00:27:19,772 --> 00:27:21,056
Go in and do your work.

309
00:27:21,148 --> 00:27:22,899
Yes.

310
00:27:32,023 --> 00:27:33,105
Young Ji...

311
00:27:33,225 --> 00:27:34,219
Congratulations.

312
00:27:34,423 --> 00:27:35,834
What do you mean?

313
00:27:35,979 --> 00:27:39,230
The board decided on the Emergency Center.

314
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,833
The Emergency Center?

315
00:27:41,054 --> 00:27:44,889
It's the Emergency Center
that Dr. Lee Cho In wanted.

316
00:27:45,099 --> 00:27:46,814
Is that so?

317
00:27:47,011 --> 00:27:51,361
Then, does that mean something
good happened to my doctor?

318
00:27:51,506 --> 00:27:57,022
What kind of person,
who came in with help, doesn't know?

319
00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:02,616
Young Ji.

320
00:28:03,137 --> 00:28:05,227
Doctor.

321
00:28:05,436 --> 00:28:06,845
Let's go eat.

322
00:28:07,521 --> 00:28:08,952
Doctor,

323
00:28:09,245 --> 00:28:12,428
I heard you have good news.
Is that true?

324
00:28:12,676 --> 00:28:17,438
Yes. I can now have
my father's wish come true.

325
00:28:17,748 --> 00:28:21,621
That's great.
That's very great.

326
00:28:21,894 --> 00:28:24,705
You know about father...

327
00:28:24,942 --> 00:28:26,920
<i>Lee Cho In.</i>

328
00:28:33,696 --> 00:28:36,777
Young Ji, just wait a little bit.
I'll be right back.

329
00:28:36,851 --> 00:28:42,071
No. You two should slowly talk.

330
00:28:42,807 --> 00:28:46,304
I'll be done soon.
Wait for me.

331
00:28:46,528 --> 00:28:48,330
Okay.

332
00:28:51,102 --> 00:28:53,978
Lee Cho In,

333
00:28:55,388 --> 00:28:59,088
are you the one who's trying
to take off my doctor's coat?

334
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,857
You have no right to be a doctor.

335
00:29:02,242 --> 00:29:03,275
What?

336
00:29:03,397 --> 00:29:12,814
The tumor on your left lob is 4.7 cm,
but you've continued doing surgery.

337
00:29:12,977 --> 00:29:14,660
That's something I'll take care of on my own.

338
00:29:14,768 --> 00:29:17,410
A patient's life's on the line,
so how can it be your problem?

339
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:19,303
With a tumor in your head,

340
00:29:19,447 --> 00:29:23,166
if you go into surgery and have a seizure,

341
00:29:23,326 --> 00:29:25,814
what are you going to do then?

342
00:29:26,219 --> 00:29:27,999
To you,

343
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:32,895
is a patient's life that worthless?

344
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:40,550
Now that I think about it,
it must be worthless.

345
00:29:40,752 --> 00:29:47,660
That's why you killed your brother, right?

346
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:57,183
Are you doing this, not knowing
how important the Neurology Center is to me?

347
00:29:57,293 --> 00:29:59,115
I'm doing this because I know.

348
00:29:59,291 --> 00:30:01,831
Don't you get it?

349
00:30:02,038 --> 00:30:04,085
You brat.

350
00:30:07,219 --> 00:30:11,565
There's no strength in your right hand?

351
00:30:11,773 --> 00:30:17,207
Are you already suffering from flaccid paralysis?

352
00:30:17,408 --> 00:30:22,608
{\a6}flaccid paralysis = Muscles have no response
no matter how much they are stimulated.

353
00:30:22,849 --> 00:30:25,384
You don't have the right to be a doctor.

354
00:30:25,567 --> 00:30:27,865
You take off your gown on your own.

355
00:30:27,943 --> 00:30:33,025
No, I can't even if I die.

356
00:30:33,325 --> 00:30:37,881
I won't give up being a doctor, even if I die.

357
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:46,857
Then, clarify justly at the
ethics committee meeting.

358
00:31:04,958 --> 00:31:05,927
Young Ji.

359
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,777
Doctor.

360
00:31:08,018 --> 00:31:09,343
I'm hungry.

361
00:31:09,408 --> 00:31:11,781
What should we eat?

362
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:47,542
Doctor, is the Emergency Center that important?

363
00:31:48,903 --> 00:31:55,602
Isn't it because of the Center that your relationship
with Dr. Lee Sun Woo is so bad?

364
00:31:56,065 --> 00:32:02,157
It's all done, so you don't have
to worry about it, okay?

365
00:32:02,369 --> 00:32:06,166
I'm still worried though.

366
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:12,005
Isn't he your only hyung in this world?

367
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:16,629
I'm thankful you're worried,

368
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:22,276
but when we're together,
let's only talk about us.

369
00:32:22,672 --> 00:32:24,980
Okay.

370
00:32:27,276 --> 00:32:30,324
And, let's touch like this.

371
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:32,169
Doctor.

372
00:32:32,853 --> 00:32:37,222
What?
You said you love me.

373
00:32:37,377 --> 00:32:39,296
What?

374
00:32:40,115 --> 00:32:42,643
You said that last time.

375
00:32:42,896 --> 00:32:45,180
You don't?

376
00:32:49,675 --> 00:32:55,052
Young Ji, last time we couldn't
see the nightlife, right?

377
00:32:55,317 --> 00:32:57,424
Do you want to go tonight?

378
00:32:57,666 --> 00:33:00,243
Today?

379
00:33:01,959 --> 00:33:03,955
Yes.

380
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:25,302
Are you okay?

381
00:33:25,573 --> 00:33:27,491
I'm fine.

382
00:34:00,564 --> 00:34:02,552
<i>Father...</i>

383
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:06,246
Trying to win you over,

384
00:34:08,915 --> 00:34:12,224
I never wanted that.

385
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:17,796
I wanted to be like you.

386
00:34:19,944 --> 00:34:24,730
So I ran after you,
looking at your back.

387
00:34:26,996 --> 00:34:30,896
If this is what you want,

388
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:37,620
then I'll have to follow, right?

389
00:34:40,763 --> 00:34:43,853
But Father,

390
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:52,641
my gown being taken off
by someone else's hands,

391
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:56,000
I can never see that.

392
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:58,850
<i>Instead,</i>

393
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:04,377
I'd rather die.

394
00:35:42,094 --> 00:35:44,691
Father...

395
00:35:46,959 --> 00:35:50,290
Just a little...

396
00:35:52,011 --> 00:36:00,520
why didn't you hold me
just a little earlier?

397
00:36:00,986 --> 00:36:03,827
Just a little...

398
00:36:04,581 --> 00:36:07,592
earlier...

399
00:36:29,993 --> 00:36:32,075
<i>Father.</i>

400
00:36:36,147 --> 00:36:38,066
<i>Doctor,</i>

401
00:36:38,226 --> 00:36:41,008
<i>in Ahngyeongdo where I used to live,</i>

402
00:36:41,209 --> 00:36:45,968
<i>the lights would all be off
at night, so it'd be black.</i>

403
00:36:46,198 --> 00:36:48,272
<i>But here in Seoul,</i>

404
00:36:48,429 --> 00:36:53,541
even when it's night
the lights are lit,

405
00:36:53,746 --> 00:36:56,084
so it's very pretty.

406
00:36:56,243 --> 00:37:03,590
People probably lit all those lights, right?

407
00:37:03,726 --> 00:37:11,663
Those people who lost family, right?

408
00:37:11,882 --> 00:37:15,213
When we become a family,

409
00:37:15,447 --> 00:37:20,112
do you think we can
become like those lights?

410
00:37:20,758 --> 00:37:26,727
I wonder what kind of people your family is.

411
00:37:26,948 --> 00:37:32,505
Those people are probably
very plain people, right?

412
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:38,209
They care about each other
and love each other.

413
00:37:41,786 --> 00:37:45,143
I'll find out when I meet them.

414
00:37:45,665 --> 00:37:49,768
What does that mean?

415
00:37:50,195 --> 00:37:55,064
I'm searching for your parents.

416
00:37:55,243 --> 00:38:01,868
We can probably hear good news soon.

417
00:38:02,275 --> 00:38:03,805
Doctor.

418
00:38:04,071 --> 00:38:08,797
Don't be touched yet.

419
00:38:11,437 --> 00:38:13,004
<i>Young Ji,</i>

420
00:38:13,246 --> 00:38:15,531
<i>just because you meet your real family,</i>

421
00:38:15,759 --> 00:38:19,186
you can't push me away, okay?

422
00:38:22,821 --> 00:38:26,577
How could I do that to you?

423
00:38:26,701 --> 00:38:29,583
<i>Even if you told me to,</i>

424
00:38:29,792 --> 00:38:34,988
I'd hold on tight and never let go.

425
00:38:35,247 --> 00:38:38,440
Never.

426
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:46,630
<i>I throw away but our memories that are still left</i>

427
00:38:46,889 --> 00:38:54,070
<i>Even with my eyes closed I look for you</i>

428
00:38:54,294 --> 00:39:01,354
<i>I call you and call you whose sick</i>

429
00:39:01,576 --> 00:39:09,154
<i>You hold onto me, whose unsteady</i>

430
00:39:09,407 --> 00:39:11,455
<i>Stop</i>

431
00:39:11,619 --> 00:39:17,599
<i>trying to hide those tears</i>

432
00:39:17,835 --> 00:39:23,819
<i>that keep flowing down my cheeks</i>

433
00:39:24,051 --> 00:39:26,299
<i>Stop</i>

434
00:39:26,458 --> 00:39:32,326
<i>the lies that left me hurt</i>

435
00:39:32,576 --> 00:39:38,379
<i>Today I swallow to end them</i>

436
00:39:38,565 --> 00:39:42,309
<i>In the end, I will forget</i>

437
00:39:42,566 --> 00:39:45,706
<i>It will end</i>

438
00:39:45,985 --> 00:39:48,972
<i>Yeah, it's not a big deal</i>

439
00:39:49,162 --> 00:39:53,030
<i>It'll become okay like this</i>

440
00:39:53,251 --> 00:39:56,678
<i>See, even if you're not here</i>

441
00:39:56,847 --> 00:40:00,753
<i>I'll still able to live</i>

442
00:40:00,971 --> 00:40:04,748
<i>I am</i>

443
00:40:07,945 --> 00:40:11,451
<i>Even though the tears have dried</i>

444
00:40:11,641 --> 00:40:17,896
<i>I still don't have the confidence</i>

445
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:23,258
<i>I don't</i>

446
00:40:59,226 --> 00:41:01,360
Should I try calling him?

447
00:41:01,595 --> 00:41:03,177
Yeah.

448
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:10,701
Where is Dr. Lee Sun Woo right now?

449
00:41:10,923 --> 00:41:12,579
What?

450
00:41:13,264 --> 00:41:14,991
Alright.

451
00:41:15,255 --> 00:41:18,752
<i>They said Dr. Lee Sun Woo
didn't come today.</i>

452
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:24,296
Dr. Lee Cho In, it seems like
Dr. Lee Sun Woo didn't come today.

453
00:41:24,485 --> 00:41:25,942
Would you still like to go ahead?

454
00:41:26,068 --> 00:41:31,673
No, let's wait for him
to do this at another time.

455
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:34,499
That's okay, right?

456
00:41:36,175 --> 00:41:38,130
Thank you.

457
00:41:44,176 --> 00:41:50,443
<i>When you hear the beep, leave a message.
After the message, press the # key.</i>

458
00:41:50,629 --> 00:41:54,221
Lee Sun Woo, where are you right now?

459
00:41:54,609 --> 00:41:57,499
Are you hiding cowardly?

460
00:41:57,607 --> 00:42:02,476
You were so confident,
but why are you hiding now?

461
00:42:02,621 --> 00:42:04,059
Come out.

462
00:42:04,283 --> 00:42:09,440
There's nowhere in the world you can hide.

463
00:42:25,145 --> 00:42:28,149
- Ahjumma.
- Oh, Seo Yeon.

464
00:42:28,437 --> 00:42:33,187
I couldn't get in touch with Sun Woo oppa,
so I thought maybe something was wrong.

465
00:42:33,329 --> 00:42:35,021
He's not contacting you either?

466
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:36,360
Then..

467
00:42:37,575 --> 00:42:39,153
Vice President.

468
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:42,060
What happened?
Have you found Sun Woo?

469
00:42:42,288 --> 00:42:44,030
We were just contacted by the police.

470
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:46,853
They found his car.

471
00:42:47,114 --> 00:42:48,560
Where?

472
00:42:48,708 --> 00:42:50,848
They found it near Gangwondo.

473
00:42:50,926 --> 00:42:53,185
<i>Gangwondo?</i>

474
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:57,234
Then, perhaps Belly Button Villa?

475
00:42:57,576 --> 00:42:59,303
What do you mean "Belly Button Villa"?

476
00:42:59,507 --> 00:43:01,514
<i>You know Ahjussi's villa.</i>

477
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,499
It's in the center of Korean land,

478
00:43:03,668 --> 00:43:09,079
so Oppa and Cho In call it Belly Button Villa.

479
00:43:09,808 --> 00:43:13,095
I'll go.
I'll go and contact you.

480
00:43:13,253 --> 00:43:15,770
Will you do that?

481
00:43:28,489 --> 00:43:30,812
Dr. Kang Seok Hun.

482
00:43:35,347 --> 00:43:38,036
Dr. Lee Sun Woo's condition,

483
00:43:38,733 --> 00:43:41,472
how bad is it?

484
00:43:50,727 --> 00:43:53,400
<i>He received a treatment of 50 linear acceleration,</i>

485
00:43:53,401 --> 00:43:56,689
<i>but an irregularity is forming by his tumor.</i>

486
00:43:57,151 --> 00:43:58,741
<i>If he doesn't have surgery right away,</i>

487
00:43:58,956 --> 00:44:02,517
<i>no one can know how much longer he has.</i>

488
00:44:02,636 --> 00:44:05,526
<i>You're trying to ruin my doctor's license?</i>

489
00:44:05,615 --> 00:44:08,693
<i>I spent 17 hours of everyday, without fail,</i>

490
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,231
<i>trudging around the OR.</i>

491
00:44:11,487 --> 00:44:13,821
<i>Father did not acknowledge me,</i>

492
00:44:14,081 --> 00:44:16,489
<i>and did not give me a chance.</i>

493
00:44:16,653 --> 00:44:20,116
<i>It may be "no more than" to you,
who monopolized Father's love,</i>

494
00:44:20,377 --> 00:44:22,899
<i>but not to me.</i>

495
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:28,904
<i>Because you were the brother I loved
more than anyone in the world.</i>

496
00:44:29,118 --> 00:44:30,888
Because you were my idol!

497
00:44:30,995 --> 00:44:34,123
Because you were like a god to me!

498
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:41,298
Because my little brother Lee Cho In
already died in China.

499
00:44:43,483 --> 00:44:51,086
<i>Lee Sun Woo, then your sins are not forgiven.</i>

500
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,672
Cho In...

501
00:45:29,217 --> 00:45:32,385
Cho In, this is the sound of my heart.

502
00:45:32,581 --> 00:45:33,850
Do you hear it?

503
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:36,574
Yeah. I hear it.

504
00:45:36,726 --> 00:45:41,141
Lee Cho In, until the day
this heart stops beating,

505
00:45:41,353 --> 00:45:44,036
I will protect you.

506
00:45:44,334 --> 00:45:45,654
Just like today,

507
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,108
if anyone bothers you again,

508
00:45:48,202 --> 00:45:50,318
I'll protect you.

509
00:45:50,543 --> 00:45:53,191
I won't let you suffer by yourself again.

510
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:55,664
I promise.

511
00:46:13,984 --> 00:46:15,950
<i>Do you remember?</i>

512
00:46:16,154 --> 00:46:22,647
In our childhood, when I went
around smiling all the time?

513
00:46:23,015 --> 00:46:25,605
"What are you so happy about?",

514
00:46:25,877 --> 00:46:29,423
Mother would chide.

515
00:46:29,848 --> 00:46:32,294
Back then,

516
00:46:32,698 --> 00:46:35,855
I really wasn't happy at all.

517
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,479
Lee Sun Woo, you...

518
00:46:39,784 --> 00:46:44,000
I loved you more than anyone in the world.

519
00:46:45,376 --> 00:46:48,914
<i>It's been three years, and you came back.</i>

520
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:50,591
It's like a dream.

521
00:46:50,655 --> 00:46:52,358
You and I were so happy,

522
00:46:52,455 --> 00:46:53,822
we hugged.

523
00:46:53,902 --> 00:46:57,321
Sun Woo hyung, where are you hiding?

524
00:46:57,582 --> 00:46:58,331
I miss you.

525
00:46:58,532 --> 00:47:05,132
<i>{\a6}No matter how much I close my eyes</i>

526
00:46:58,526 --> 00:47:01,561
Dear Sun Woo

527
00:47:01,681 --> 00:47:05,040
happy birthday.

528
00:47:05,636 --> 00:47:11,620
<i>{\a6}No matter how much I hold a grudge</i>

529
00:47:06,357 --> 00:47:09,358
It's been four years since I've seen you.

530
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:11,684
I miss you.

531
00:47:11,797 --> 00:47:14,197
Hurry come back here.

532
00:47:11,798 --> 00:47:13,998
<i>{\a6}I just call you</i>

533
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:17,598
<i>{\a6}I just look for you</i>

534
00:47:14,583 --> 00:47:17,741
I regret it,

535
00:47:17,742 --> 00:47:23,842
<i>{\a6}Even though you make me cry</i>

536
00:47:17,901 --> 00:47:20,428
Cho In.

537
00:47:26,648 --> 00:47:32,075
<i>{\a6}My heart that only knows you</i>

538
00:47:24,026 --> 00:47:32,063
Enough to die. I regret it.

539
00:47:33,977 --> 00:47:39,163
<i>Stopping the deeply impressed memories</i>

540
00:47:39,321 --> 00:47:42,695
<i>I can't forget</i>

541
00:47:42,879 --> 00:47:47,288
<i>I can't forget</i>

542
00:47:47,673 --> 00:47:54,222
<i>I wander looking for you</i>

543
00:47:55,271 --> 00:47:59,199
<i>{\a6}I hug you and love you</i>

544
00:47:59,462 --> 00:48:03,384
<i>{\a6}and live in my dreams</i>

545
00:48:01,485 --> 00:48:03,385
Stupid.

546
00:48:03,485 --> 00:48:06,585
<i>{\a6}At that one word let's separate</i>

547
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:09,719
<i>{\a6}My heart just breaks</i>

548
00:48:03,398 --> 00:48:06,803
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?

549
00:48:09,943 --> 00:48:13,284
<i>How can I forget you</i>

550
00:48:13,456 --> 00:48:16,644
<i>when I'm not ready yet?</i>

551
00:48:16,834 --> 00:48:20,565
<i>My heart that only looked at you</i>

552
00:48:20,816 --> 00:48:24,178
<i>All those promises</i>

553
00:48:24,393 --> 00:48:26,017
<i>Hurt</i>

554
00:48:26,289 --> 00:48:29,492
<i>I only see you</i>

555
00:48:29,694 --> 00:48:31,430
<i>What do I do?</i>

556
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:40,025
<i>Is there a love that's not yours?</i>

557
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:44,004
<i>Even if you leave and forget me,</i>

558
00:48:44,209 --> 00:48:47,132
<i>even if you love again,</i>

559
00:48:47,369 --> 00:48:51,040
<i>my heart that can't have you,</i>

560
00:48:51,212 --> 00:48:54,350
<i>even if a burn mark is left,</i>

561
00:48:54,551 --> 00:48:58,152
<i>the person I am waiting for</i>

562
00:48:58,337 --> 00:49:01,481
<i>is only you.</i>

563
00:49:01,683 --> 00:49:05,392
<i>Your love is the only one</i>

564
00:49:05,514 --> 00:49:10,604
<i>that can make me better</i>

565
00:49:11,601 --> 00:49:14,930
<i>My heart</i>

566
00:49:25,353 --> 00:49:28,415
Sun Woo oppa, where are you?

567
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:33,813
Can you come get me?

568
00:49:33,959 --> 00:49:35,970
Yeah. Where are you?

569
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,429
Where are you?

570
00:49:39,334 --> 00:49:46,696
Can you take me and go to Seoul?

571
00:49:46,841 --> 00:49:49,160
Just wait a little.
I'll be there.

572
00:49:49,292 --> 00:49:51,519
Just wait.

573
00:50:45,071 --> 00:50:46,238
Oppa!

574
00:50:46,632 --> 00:50:48,244
Oppa.

575
00:50:49,564 --> 00:50:51,615
Oppa.

576
00:50:55,362 --> 00:50:56,498
You're okay....

577
00:50:56,707 --> 00:50:58,793
You're okay, Oppa.

578
00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:00,932
You'll be okay soon.

579
00:51:01,123 --> 00:51:03,388
You're okay.

580
00:51:06,294 --> 00:51:12,095
Sun Woo oppa, can you hear me?

581
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:14,850
I'm right here.

582
00:51:15,051 --> 00:51:20,626
Seo Yeon isn't going anywhere
and here by your side.

583
00:51:31,869 --> 00:51:34,422
Oppa...

584
00:51:35,219 --> 00:51:41,319
It's been 7 years since
I've received my heart.

585
00:51:41,572 --> 00:51:44,657
Because of you and Lee Cho In,

586
00:51:44,869 --> 00:51:47,081
you brothers,

587
00:51:47,215 --> 00:51:50,234
I've been through so much pain,

588
00:51:50,426 --> 00:51:54,381
so I don't know how much
more I can take.

589
00:51:55,634 --> 00:52:03,754
I don't want to take someone
else's heart to live.

590
00:52:03,918 --> 00:52:09,549
I don't want to wait
for someone I love.

591
00:52:11,058 --> 00:52:14,080
So, Oppa...

592
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:18,745
whether it be two months or two years,

593
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:21,857
let's get treatment.

594
00:52:22,425 --> 00:52:25,204
Let's get up soon,

595
00:52:25,815 --> 00:52:32,424
and go to Cho In
and beg for forgiveness,

596
00:52:32,646 --> 00:52:37,103
and live with me, okay?

597
00:52:37,334 --> 00:52:40,775
Now hold my hand

598
00:52:40,953 --> 00:52:43,342
and go for walks

599
00:52:43,573 --> 00:52:47,213
and read me books.

600
00:52:47,608 --> 00:52:53,599
You have to let me wear a dress.

601
00:52:54,361 --> 00:52:56,870
You have to get up

602
00:52:57,076 --> 00:53:00,919
and tell me you love me.

603
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:04,887
Right?

604
00:53:14,706 --> 00:53:17,065
You're up?

605
00:53:20,566 --> 00:53:23,154
I'm sorry.

606
00:53:25,594 --> 00:53:29,190
I can only do this much.

607
00:53:29,423 --> 00:53:35,560
I'm really sorry to you.

608
00:53:37,499 --> 00:53:39,378
Lee Sun Woo.

609
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:42,102
Lee Sun Woo.

610
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:54,437
Seo Yeon, can you take me to Seoul?

611
00:53:54,723 --> 00:53:58,322
... to Cho In?

612
00:53:58,892 --> 00:54:01,605
Will you take me?

613
00:54:02,804 --> 00:54:06,224
Yeah. Let's go.

614
00:54:06,934 --> 00:54:09,688
Let's go to Cho In.

615
00:54:26,731 --> 00:54:29,941
[Lee Cho In]

616
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:40,161
[My son]

617
00:54:40,304 --> 00:54:43,828
[I'm leaving this...]

618
00:54:49,466 --> 00:54:51,424
- Hello.
- Good morning.

619
00:54:54,909 --> 00:54:56,836
Good morning.

620
00:54:57,269 --> 00:54:58,869
You came?

621
00:54:59,047 --> 00:55:02,028
Lee Sun Woo still didn't come?

622
00:55:27,793 --> 00:55:29,867
<i>- Isn't that Dr. Lee Sun Woo?
- Right?</i>

623
00:55:29,924 --> 00:55:31,950
<i>I heard he didn't come to the ethics hearing.</i>

624
00:55:31,951 --> 00:55:33,369
Did he finally show up?

625
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:36,291
<i>Then, does that mean Dr. Lee
is going to lose his license?</i>

626
00:55:36,425 --> 00:55:38,075
<i>Don't you think his body looks a bit weird?</i>

627
00:55:38,177 --> 00:55:41,228
<i>Maybe he really does have a tumor.</i>

628
00:55:53,628 --> 00:55:55,496
Seo Yeon,

629
00:55:55,749 --> 00:55:57,700
from here,

630
00:55:57,977 --> 00:56:01,286
will you let me walk on my own?

631
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:06,906
Yeah, go safely.

632
00:56:53,012 --> 00:56:55,492
Lee Cho In...

633
00:57:01,109 --> 00:57:02,805
Why?

634
00:57:03,327 --> 00:57:06,120
Are you scared because you're dying?

635
00:57:06,377 --> 00:57:12,046
Is that why you put aside
your pride and came?

636
00:57:12,224 --> 00:57:15,325
Trying to do whatever to live?

637
00:57:16,496 --> 00:57:21,371
Yeah, that's why I came.

638
00:57:21,865 --> 00:57:27,699
Lee Cho In, you perform my surgery.

639
00:57:31,496 --> 00:57:32,443
What?

640
00:57:32,519 --> 00:57:35,433
Whether I live or die,

641
00:57:35,662 --> 00:57:37,192
you decide.

642
00:57:37,331 --> 00:57:40,057
Why do I have to do that?

643
00:57:44,036 --> 00:57:46,708
Someone who's dying on his own,

644
00:57:46,912 --> 00:57:48,709
someone who tried to kill me,

645
00:57:48,994 --> 00:57:52,079
why do I, with my hands, have to save him?

646
00:57:52,162 --> 00:57:55,233
If I die, I want to by your hands.

647
00:57:55,409 --> 00:57:58,905
If I live, I want to by your hands.

648
00:57:59,194 --> 00:58:04,807
Lee Cho In, you do the surgery.

649
00:58:05,211 --> 00:58:07,266
I'm not doing the surgery.

650
00:58:07,447 --> 00:58:12,816
I won't and while
you regret it until you die,

651
00:58:13,034 --> 00:58:16,980
little by little...,
slowly...,

652
00:58:17,196 --> 00:58:20,964
I'm going to watch you die.

653
00:58:33,249 --> 00:58:35,534
- Dr. Kim,
- Yes?

654
00:58:35,718 --> 00:58:40,818
Cho In, do you think he'll perform
Lee Sun Woo's surgery?

655
00:58:41,099 --> 00:58:43,643
What do you mean do you think?
He has to.

656
00:58:43,802 --> 00:58:45,662
He's still his hyung.

657
00:58:45,806 --> 00:58:47,982
That's what's worrying me more.

658
00:58:48,143 --> 00:58:49,802
Looking at Cho In lately,

659
00:58:49,926 --> 00:58:54,994
I don't think he'll blink an eye even
if he heard Lee Sun Woo is dying.

660
00:58:55,370 --> 00:58:58,073
Well, now that you said that,
that's true.

661
00:58:58,293 --> 00:59:00,347
Is that true?

662
00:59:02,325 --> 00:59:08,798
<i>Dr. Lee Cho In refused to perform
Dr. Lee Sun Woo's surgery, is that true?</i>

663
00:59:08,952 --> 00:59:11,328
<i>The news has spread all
throughout the hospital.</i>

664
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:13,593
<i>I didn't see Dr. Lee Cho In like that,</i>

665
00:59:13,734 --> 00:59:16,257
<i>but I guess he's very harsh.</i>

666
00:59:21,683 --> 00:59:23,442
Should I help you?

667
00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:25,825
No, I'll do it.

668
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:28,466
Okay.

669
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:51,250
It was my everything.

670
00:59:57,464 --> 00:59:59,051
Oppa...

671
01:00:01,426 --> 01:00:03,374
Oppa...
Oppa..

672
01:00:03,553 --> 01:00:05,474
Oppa...
Sun Woo oppa...

673
01:00:05,743 --> 01:00:08,533
Is someone there?
Someone help.

674
01:00:12,370 --> 01:00:14,179
Oppa...

675
01:00:16,525 --> 01:00:19,002
Dr. Lee Sun Woo...
When did he get like this?

676
01:00:19,138 --> 01:00:22,381
<i>He got like this five minutes before, Doctor.</i>

677
01:00:27,344 --> 01:00:28,325
<i>His brain pressure is increasing!</i>

678
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:30,339
<i>Take him to the emergency CT scan
and get an operation room ready.</i>

679
01:00:30,478 --> 01:00:31,063
<i>Yes.</i>

680
01:00:31,187 --> 01:00:32,708
<i>Cho In...</i>

681
01:00:33,468 --> 01:00:35,298
<i>Cho In...</i>

682
01:00:35,505 --> 01:00:39,284
Dr. Lee Sun Woo, stay still.

683
01:00:48,259 --> 01:00:50,843
Lee Cho In.

684
01:01:07,608 --> 01:01:09,011
Oppa...
Oppa...

685
01:01:09,113 --> 01:01:10,861
What are you doing?
Move him to the CT room.

686
01:01:10,994 --> 01:01:12,091
- Yes.
- Oppa

687
01:01:12,204 --> 01:01:14,114
<i>Move him to the CT room now.</i>

688
01:01:14,115 --> 01:01:14,750
<i>Yes.</i>

689
01:01:28,253 --> 01:01:29,874
<i>If he doesn't have surgery right away,</i>

690
01:01:30,062 --> 01:01:35,362
<i>no one can know how much longer he has.</i>

691
01:01:37,051 --> 01:01:42,618
<i>How could a brother kill a brother?!</i>

692
01:01:45,131 --> 01:01:47,108
<i>I thought when I returned from the States,</i>

693
01:01:47,377 --> 01:01:50,457
<i>that my Neurology Center would be established.</i>

694
01:01:50,659 --> 01:01:53,162
<i>But, what was waiting for me</i>

695
01:01:53,364 --> 01:01:55,103
<i>was just your name</i>

696
01:01:55,302 --> 01:01:58,489
<i>on a lousy "Gift Agreement" piece of paper.</i>

697
01:01:58,583 --> 01:01:59,821
<i>And Father,</i>

698
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:02,190
<i>rather than choosing me,</i>

699
01:02:02,350 --> 01:02:05,802
<i>had chose you, Lee Cho In!</i>

700
01:02:12,263 --> 01:02:14,959
<i>If I die, I want to by your hands.</i>

701
01:02:15,196 --> 01:02:18,582
<i>If I live, I want to by your hands.</i>

702
01:02:18,924 --> 01:02:24,191
Lee Cho In, you do the surgery.

703
01:02:31,259 --> 01:02:33,845
Dr. Lee Cho In.

704
01:02:50,864 --> 01:02:53,851
<i>Dr. Lee Cho In, where are you?</i>

705
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:58,423
The CT results from the emergency room
are here and there is internal bleeding.

706
01:02:58,601 --> 01:03:02,649
What's more urgent is that the bigger tumor
has internal bleeding and a lot of swelling.

707
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:04,365
<i>If he doesn't have surgery right now,</i>

708
01:03:04,446 --> 01:03:07,098
<i>I don't know what's going to
happen to Dr. Lee Sun Woo.</i>

709
01:03:07,296 --> 01:03:10,461
Cho In, are you listening?

710
01:03:10,606 --> 01:03:12,590
<i>Dr. Lee Cho In.</i>

711
01:03:25,789 --> 01:03:28,137
Lee Sun Woo...

712
01:03:28,385 --> 01:03:30,552
just...

713
01:03:31,614 --> 01:03:33,077
die...

719
01:03:49,178 --> 01:03:50,879
<i>Then close his head back up
after just reducing the pressure?</i>

720
01:03:50,944 --> 01:03:53,203
<i>We need to stop the internal hemorrhage
and remove the tumor, don't we?!</i>

721
01:03:53,390 --> 01:03:54,588
Unstable.
Let's hurry.

722
01:03:54,651 --> 01:03:56,625
What about Cho In?
Where is Cho In?

723
01:03:56,788 --> 01:03:59,506
<i>Sun Woo said if it isn't Cho In,
he won't get surgery from anyone.</i>

724
01:03:59,697 --> 01:04:00,993
<i>Dr. Kang Seok Hun, call him again.</i>

725
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:03,136
<i>You just went in,
but why are you out?</i>

726
01:04:03,308 --> 01:04:04,176
<i>He couldn't...</i>

727
01:04:04,270 --> 01:04:05,773
<i>Do you think that too, Young Ji?</i>

728
01:04:05,834 --> 01:04:07,179
<i>For my one and only brother</i>

729
01:04:07,318 --> 01:04:09,340
<i>I won't perform surgery,
so that I'm a bad person?</i>

730
01:04:09,413 --> 01:04:11,634
<i>I know how you feel, Doctor.</i>

731
01:04:11,702 --> 01:04:16,915
<i>I know that compared to doing surgery,
not doing it is much harder.</i>

732
01:04:17,066 --> 01:04:18,253
<i>This...</i>

733
01:04:18,254 --> 01:04:20,126
<i>I will do as I wish.</i>
