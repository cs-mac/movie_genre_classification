No. I mean, yes. She's
had a seizure before.

No, the doctors never found anything.

335
00:17:03,753 --> 00:17:06,789
Well, we'll, uh, let
you have some time alone.

336
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:08,624
- You don't have to go.
- No, it's okay.

337
00:17:08,626 --> 00:17:11,660
We were just leaving.
We've been here a while.

338
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,131
I guess I'll see you in a couple weeks.

339
00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:18,801
Yeah, I'll see you there.

340
00:17:36,202 --> 00:17:39,187
We've all been there.

341
00:17:39,189 --> 00:17:42,992
It usually happens first few
months after being on the job.

342
00:17:42,994 --> 00:17:47,362
Right now you have
nothing to compare it to.

343
00:17:47,364 --> 00:17:50,416
But you will.

344
00:17:50,418 --> 00:17:53,535
The longer you work,
the more good you do...

345
00:17:53,537 --> 00:17:55,054
you'll be able to take days like this,

346
00:17:55,056 --> 00:17:58,007
put them into context,
and then move forward.

347
00:17:58,009 --> 00:18:01,310
It's just that afterwards, I'm...

348
00:18:01,312 --> 00:18:03,545
I'm looking at Mouch telling stories

349
00:18:03,547 --> 00:18:06,565
and Cruz playing video games.

350
00:18:09,486 --> 00:18:11,553
I don't know how they do it.

351
00:18:11,555 --> 00:18:13,155
Everybody has their own way

352
00:18:13,157 --> 00:18:15,724
in how they deal with things.

353
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:21,396
You will get on the
other side of this, Peter.

354
00:18:21,398 --> 00:18:22,698
You know what?

355
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,034
Take the rest of the shift off.

356
00:18:25,036 --> 00:18:27,870
Go easy.

357
00:18:27,872 --> 00:18:29,538
I'm serious, though. Talk to someone.

358
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,540
Counselor's available. So am I.

359
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:34,426
So is your Lieutenant.

360
00:18:34,428 --> 00:18:37,262
Okay?

361
00:18:37,264 --> 00:18:40,432
Okay.

362
00:18:43,553 --> 00:18:45,604
[Chuckling] Oh, yeah, it stays with me.

363
00:18:45,606 --> 00:18:47,106
For sure.

364
00:18:47,108 --> 00:18:48,774
Thank you, dude.

365
00:18:48,776 --> 00:18:51,860
My buddy Eddie over at 61,

366
00:18:51,862 --> 00:18:53,562
"sworn to secrecy."

367
00:18:53,564 --> 00:18:56,098
Uh, the Canadians?
Guess where they're from.

368
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,432
Canada.

369
00:18:57,434 --> 00:18:59,768
- Cleveland.
- What?

370
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,788
Herrmann put 'em up to it.

371
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:05,824
Oh, that sneaky son of a bitch.

372
00:19:05,826 --> 00:19:08,377
He's the only one I confided
to about me and Canada.

373
00:19:08,379 --> 00:19:09,712
And this is what he does to me?

374
00:19:09,714 --> 00:19:11,463
I don't know what Herrmann's end game is

375
00:19:11,465 --> 00:19:12,748
in this prank,

376
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:16,468
but if you're asking me,
I say we beat him to it.

377
00:19:18,722 --> 00:19:20,723
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

378
00:19:20,725 --> 00:19:25,094
- Yeah.
- Yes. All right.

379
00:19:25,096 --> 00:19:27,479
Hey, Shay. You got a visitor again.

380
00:19:27,481 --> 00:19:29,464
Ugh. Clarice again?

381
00:19:29,466 --> 00:19:32,434
Her husband.

382
00:19:32,436 --> 00:19:34,486
Nice to see you.

383
00:19:34,488 --> 00:19:37,639
I'm looking for my wife and my unborn son.

384
00:19:37,641 --> 00:19:39,358
Would you be kind enough to point me

385
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,859
in the right direction?

386
00:19:40,861 --> 00:19:44,312
Yeah. She's been staying
with me a couple days.

387
00:19:44,314 --> 00:19:47,116
So, in light of the fact that you have

388
00:19:47,118 --> 00:19:49,585
zero boundaries, I will tell you now

389
00:19:49,587 --> 00:19:51,370
very directly that if you think that I'm...

390
00:19:51,372 --> 00:19:53,839
Daniel, you might want
to bring it down a peg,

391
00:19:53,841 --> 00:19:55,257
because this is your problem.

392
00:19:55,259 --> 00:19:56,992
Right, you... you have
nothing to do with it.

393
00:19:56,994 --> 00:20:00,012
She came to me as a friend
needing a place to stay.

394
00:20:00,014 --> 00:20:01,847
So I, as a friend, took her in.

395
00:20:01,849 --> 00:20:04,800
I sympathize with what
you're going through,

396
00:20:04,802 --> 00:20:06,268
and I wish I hadn't been brought into this,

397
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:08,336
but if you keep coming at
me like you're coming at me,

398
00:20:08,338 --> 00:20:12,191
I'm gonna tell you to
kiss my ass in two seconds.

399
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:17,062
[Sighs]

400
00:20:17,064 --> 00:20:19,347
What can I do?

401
00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:23,068
This is my family we're talking about.

402
00:20:29,492 --> 00:20:33,028
I can't get it out of my head.

403
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,713
Just... I can't get it out of my head.

404
00:20:34,715 --> 00:20:38,417
There was a time when your
father couldn't either.

405
00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:42,888
And his way of fixing it
was to just shove it down.

406
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:48,143
And then that turned into
shutting off a part of himself.

407
00:20:48,145 --> 00:20:51,313
It's the part that makes us human.

408
00:20:51,315 --> 00:20:53,982
Then what do I do?

409
00:20:53,984 --> 00:20:57,436
Walk away.

410
00:20:57,438 --> 00:20:58,804
You come back to the restaurant.

411
00:20:58,806 --> 00:21:01,607
I don't want you to become a block of ice.

412
00:21:01,609 --> 00:21:04,193
I mean, having seen that in your father,

413
00:21:04,195 --> 00:21:07,412
believe me, you don't
want that for yourself.

414
00:21:09,532 --> 00:21:11,566
It's not who you are.

415
00:21:11,568 --> 00:21:13,919
Hmm?

00:21:13,921 --> 00:21:15,237
Just...

417
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:16,955
come home.

418
00:21:21,244 --> 00:21:23,929
Anna. Hey. It's me.

419
00:21:23,931 --> 00:21:27,415
Look, um, I need a refill...

420
00:21:27,417 --> 00:21:30,185
uh, somewhat urgently.

421
00:21:30,187 --> 00:21:33,388
I know, I know, I know. I just... I...

422
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:36,591
can you please just help me out?

423
00:21:36,593 --> 00:21:40,362
I can't. I... I don't have the time.

424
00:21:40,364 --> 00:21:44,233
I could... I could pay you
for them, if that's easier.

425
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:49,938
Anna?

426
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:52,958
Hello?

Oh, she's pissed.

Hey, Kendra. Thanks for doing this.

430
00:22:09,969 --> 00:22:11,302
I thought I was done.

431

Ah, well, you know...

432
00:22:12,889 --> 00:22:15,306
Anything on Grace Wilkinson?

433

[Keys clacking]

434
00:22:19,429 --> 00:22:21,795
Yeah, she accidentally
swallowed some turpentine.

435
00:22:21,797 --> 00:22:23,981
Her mom told us she had Celiac disease.

436
00:22:23,983 --> 00:22:26,901
Uh, mom told us she was doing some painting

437
00:22:26,903 --> 00:22:28,936
and left the turpentine out by mistake.

438
00:22:28,938 --> 00:22:30,187
We pumped the girl's stomach,

439
00:22:30,189 --> 00:22:32,273
then moved her upstairs for observation.

440
00:22:32,275 --> 00:22:35,142
She didn't want to take
her to Chicago U, remember?

441
00:22:35,144 --> 00:22:37,111
Could be hospital jumping to hide abuse.

442
00:22:37,113 --> 00:22:40,164
Abuse that she's causing for attention.

443
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:41,749
It fits.

444
00:22:41,751 --> 00:22:43,284
That would explain the mom's behavior,

445
00:22:43,286 --> 00:22:45,536
the inconsistent symptoms
that Grace is having,

446
00:22:45,538 --> 00:22:47,255
that smell that she was talking about...

447
00:22:47,257 --> 00:22:48,923
Munchausen by proxy?

448
00:22:48,925 --> 00:22:50,291
It's quite rare.

449
00:22:50,293 --> 00:22:52,043
I don't really care what you call it.

450
00:22:52,045 --> 00:22:53,794
That woman is poisoning her own kid.

451
00:22:53,796 --> 00:22:56,631
I want this reported to D.C.F.S.

452
00:22:56,633 --> 00:23:00,017
Right now. Will you back us up?

453
00:23:00,019 --> 00:23:03,521
Dinner, Friday... on me.

454
00:23:03,523 --> 00:23:05,856
I'll get the number.

455
00:23:07,643 --> 00:23:11,028
Four years ago, my old partner and I

456
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,563
reported this girl with cigarette burns

457
00:23:12,565 --> 00:23:15,232
all over her arms and legs to D.C.F.S.,

458
00:23:15,234 --> 00:23:17,702
and the investigation
was a mess of red tape

459
00:23:17,704 --> 00:23:19,287
from beginning to end.

460
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:22,740
They eventually sent the
girl back to her father.

461
00:23:22,742 --> 00:23:24,542
And that same week,

462
00:23:24,544 --> 00:23:29,213
she died of a brain bleed
from a beating he gave her.

That ain't happening again.

Chief Boden's office is this way?

Yeah.

468
00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:41,475
How's Peter doing?

469
00:23:41,477 --> 00:23:43,227
He saw a girl cut to pieces today.

I believe you all did.

it's been a long time.

Yes, it has.

Peter's not like Henry.

00:24:12,842 --> 00:24:14,342
No one expects him to be.

480

He does.

481
00:24:16,879 --> 00:24:18,629
And Peter's got this whole idea

482
00:24:18,631 --> 00:24:21,599
of living up to his father's memory.

483
00:24:21,601 --> 00:24:24,635
But that is not the life I want for him.

484

Peter's not coming back to 51.

If that's what he decides...

I'll abide by it. You have my word.

You're not hearing me.

I told you after your suspension hearing

I'm calling my lawyer.

You should call your doctor,

What you do when you have
a hothead for a partner

is you talk them out of

00:33:20,768 --> 00:33:22,151
I'll start an I.V. in the rig

663
00:33:22,153 --> 00:33:24,353
and get an order to push bicarb.

She's gonna be okay, Grace.

666
00:33:33,112 --> 00:33:37,332
You wanted to see me, Chief?

667
00:33:37,334 --> 00:33:38,534
That time you put

668
00:33:38,536 --> 00:33:41,203
all that hot sauce in Hadley's burger,

669
00:33:41,205 --> 00:33:42,504
that was funny.

670
00:33:42,506 --> 00:33:44,423
Oh, I can't take credit for that, Chief.

671

<i>I got that from Dumb & Dumber.</i>

672
00:33:45,676 --> 00:33:47,509
And the other time you put the blowup doll

673
00:33:47,511 --> 00:33:49,428
in Herrmann's bunk, that was equally funny.

674
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:51,797
That was all me.

675
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:55,634
Today that was not funny.

676
00:33:55,636 --> 00:33:57,970
I mean, breaking balls is one thing.

677
00:33:57,972 --> 00:34:00,338
But those men...

678
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:03,358
they did not pay their own way

679
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,445
and drive ten hours to come here

680
00:34:06,447 --> 00:34:07,696
to be the butt of a joke.

681
00:34:07,698 --> 00:34:09,314
When we have a guest in this house,

682
00:34:09,316 --> 00:34:11,149
you will treat them as such.

683
00:34:11,151 --> 00:34:13,018
Do you understand me?

684
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,236
Yes, Chief.

685
00:34:14,238 --> 00:34:15,854
So now you're gonna walk back out there

686
00:34:15,856 --> 00:34:17,039
like the man I know you to be.

687
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:18,523
You're gonna look 'em in the eye,

688
00:34:18,525 --> 00:34:20,125
shake their hand, and apologize,

689
00:34:20,127 --> 00:34:21,460
because when they go back home

690
00:34:21,462 --> 00:34:23,495
and their men ask them
what the C.F.D. were like,

691
00:34:23,497 --> 00:34:26,698
they will be able to say we are stand-up.

692
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,969
[Door opens] Chief.

693
00:34:30,971 --> 00:34:35,641
You need to get to Lakeshore.

694
00:34:35,643 --> 00:34:39,561
That'll be all.

695
00:34:39,563 --> 00:34:41,730
And she couldn't get
into the United States,

696
00:34:41,732 --> 00:34:44,349
so I agreed to meet her in Toronto.

697
00:34:44,351 --> 00:34:47,986
An immigration attorney
there was going to facilitate

698
00:34:47,988 --> 00:34:50,405
her American citizenship.

699
00:34:50,407 --> 00:34:54,559
I gave her the five grand for his fees...

700
00:34:56,529 --> 00:34:58,830
never saw either one of them again.

701
00:34:58,832 --> 00:34:59,948
Well, yeah, but if she was Russian,

702
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:02,618
why hate on Canada?

703
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:06,421
Two extra weeks I'm up
there getting the runaround

704
00:35:06,423 --> 00:35:09,240
from various government agencies.

705
00:35:09,242 --> 00:35:14,546
I end up at the Canadian
anti-fraud centre.

706
00:35:14,548 --> 00:35:18,249
Want to know what they said?

707
00:35:18,251 --> 00:35:20,602
Buyer beware.

708
00:35:20,604 --> 00:35:23,639
And didn't the weasel behind the counter

709
00:35:23,641 --> 00:35:26,808
get a little chuckle at my expense?

710
00:35:29,062 --> 00:35:32,447
Mouch, on behalf of the
commonwealth of Canada,

711
00:35:32,449 --> 00:35:34,700
we apologize.

712
00:35:34,702 --> 00:35:37,268
I appreciate that.

713

714
00:35:44,911 --> 00:35:47,496
Listen, I don't want to get
in anyone's business here,

715

- but if I may...
- Please.

716
00:35:49,633 --> 00:35:53,251
Only because I was recently
in Peter's situation.

717
00:35:53,253 --> 00:35:57,422
Uh, I received a call that involved...

718
00:35:57,424 --> 00:35:59,791
an infant mortality.

719
00:35:59,793 --> 00:36:03,428
And, uh, it really got to me.

720

Uh, but our Lieutenant at the time...

721
00:36:06,734 --> 00:36:11,269
he did something that really helped us out.

722
00:36:11,271 --> 00:36:13,138
She's on a ventilator now,

723
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:16,141
and dialysis to help clear the doxepin.

724
00:36:16,143 --> 00:36:20,078
We just have to wait and see.

Are you Gabriela Dawson?

You're the one who accused
Nina of poisoning our daughter?

I want to show you something.
