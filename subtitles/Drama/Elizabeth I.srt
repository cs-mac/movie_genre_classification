2
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,501
Why do you go
among the people, Majesty?

3
00:03:13,448 --> 00:03:15,882
I tell you plainly,
you will be murdered.

4
00:03:15,848 --> 00:03:18,612
Every Catholic in England
is a potential assassin!

5
00:03:18,568 --> 00:03:20,968
Be warned
by the atrocities in France.

6
00:03:20,936 --> 00:03:23,837
We know the Catholics
take their orders from Spain.

7
00:03:23,784 --> 00:03:26,651
The Spanish speak
openly of Mary Stuart

8
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:28,499
as Queen of England
in waiting.

9
00:03:28,486 --> 00:03:30,511
Their loyalty is to
the Pope in Rome!

10
00:03:30,503 --> 00:03:33,631
How many Catholics
are there in England, sir?

11
00:03:33,575 --> 00:03:35,065
Lmmense numbers,
Majesty.

12
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:39,277
Half the nation cling
to the old superstitions.

13
00:03:39,206 --> 00:03:41,538
What would you have me do?

14
00:03:41,511 --> 00:03:45,413
Hang half the people of England
or just imprison them?

15
00:03:45,317 --> 00:03:47,751
We must act, Majesty.

16
00:03:47,718 --> 00:03:50,551
Our inaction is perceived
as weakness.

17
00:03:50,565 --> 00:03:54,001
If my people break the law,
they shall be punished.

18
00:03:53,926 --> 00:03:56,224
Until that day,
they shall be protected.

19
00:03:56,197 --> 00:03:59,689
Majesty, we have proven reason to fear
every Catholic in the...

20
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,612
Fear creates fear.

21
00:04:02,565 --> 00:04:06,592
I am not ignorant
of the dangers, sir.

22
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,197
But I will not punish my people
for their beliefs.

23
00:04:10,115 --> 00:04:12,413
Only for their deeds.

24
00:04:12,387 --> 00:04:15,948
I am assured
that the people of England
love their Queen.

25
00:04:15,971 --> 00:04:18,735
My constant endeavor
is to earn that love.

26
00:04:46,144 --> 00:04:47,702
My Queen.

27
00:05:03,968 --> 00:05:06,266
Our friends write
to give us hope.

28
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,765
Soon England's
true believers will rise up

29
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:11,363
against the bastard
usurper Elizabeth

30
00:05:11,327 --> 00:05:13,090
and slit her throat.

31
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,714
That's enough!

32
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:20,450
Slit her throat? Please.

33
00:05:20,383 --> 00:05:25,514
And when that bastard
usurper is dead,
my lady will be queen.

34
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:34,644
Your bishops are preaching
that God is showing
his displeasure

35
00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:36,784
because the Queen
is still unmarried,

36
00:05:36,765 --> 00:05:39,199
some rudely
suggesting infertile.

37
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:41,213
What nonsense.

38
00:05:41,245 --> 00:05:43,270
Dangerous nonsense.

39
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,854
Mary Stuart has a son.

40
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,983
Why does everyone
torment me with Mary Stuart?

41
00:05:48,925 --> 00:05:51,223
It's not her fault
she's next in line
to the throne.

42
00:05:51,197 --> 00:05:52,186
Don't hide your face.

43
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,812
So long as you
have no issue.

44
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,253
If you were
to produce an heir,

45
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:57,124
there'd be no more talk
of Mary, Queen of Scots.

46
00:05:57,116 --> 00:06:00,574
I've heard it's customary
to obtain a husband
before producing an heir.

47
00:06:02,204 --> 00:06:04,434
We shall have to hunt
out a husband
for you soon, Bess.

48
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,741
Not too soon,
my lady.

49
00:06:05,755 --> 00:06:07,279
There are husbands
to be had.

50
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:08,690
You don't want
to be married?

51
00:06:08,698 --> 00:06:10,097
I'll want to be married
if I want the man...

52
00:06:10,106 --> 00:06:11,733
Austria. France.

53
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:14,708
Turkey. Turkey has a sultan.
China has an emperor.

54
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,118
I confine myself
to the possible.

55
00:06:17,082 --> 00:06:19,744
That's where you and I
differ, Walsingham.

56
00:06:19,706 --> 00:06:22,539
I find the impossible
far more interesting.

57
00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:26,981
What kind of man
would you want?

58
00:06:27,001 --> 00:06:29,970
An honest man
with friendly eyes.

59
00:06:29,913 --> 00:06:32,347
And good legs.
And sweet breath.

60
00:06:32,312 --> 00:06:34,507
So you can kiss him
without choking.

61
00:06:37,656 --> 00:06:39,453
There must be
any amount of princes

62
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:41,849
in the undiscovered lands
across the sea.

63
00:06:44,344 --> 00:06:46,073
Find me an honest one
of those.

64
00:07:02,454 --> 00:07:05,287
Since when do we discuss
private matters
in public spaces?

65
00:07:05,238 --> 00:07:07,365
I ask Your Majesty's
forgiveness.

66
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:11,616
Have my doctors
confirm that the Queen
is still fertile.

67
00:07:11,925 --> 00:07:13,290
The people need
to be reassured.

68
00:07:13,302 --> 00:07:14,326
I care
for your safety.

69
00:07:14,358 --> 00:07:16,656
The threats to your
person are real.

70
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,188
You know very well
if I fall,

71
00:07:18,198 --> 00:07:21,190
you'll all come
tumbling down after me.

72
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:23,234
The sea wall at Dover
is cracking, Francis.

73
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,348
We have no money
to rebuild our defenses.

74
00:07:26,292 --> 00:07:28,692
Turn your mind
to that threat.

75
00:07:42,387 --> 00:07:46,756
May we have wisdom
not to fear shadows
in the night.

76
00:07:48,563 --> 00:07:53,125
And courage when the day
of danger truly dawns.

77
00:08:25,553 --> 00:08:27,851
My time has come,
Majesty.

78
00:08:28,912 --> 00:08:32,177
Send me back to England
to begin God's work.

79
00:08:53,134 --> 00:08:54,601
Your Majesty.

80
00:09:12,237 --> 00:09:14,432
Guards!
Take hold of him!

81
00:09:16,716 --> 00:09:19,184
A puddle in the way,

82
00:09:19,723 --> 00:09:21,088
Majesty.

83
00:09:26,091 --> 00:09:27,888
A puddle.

84
00:09:50,121 --> 00:09:51,315
Puddle.

85
00:09:58,025 --> 00:10:00,016
You'll have to see
the Lord Chamberlain, sir.

86
00:10:00,008 --> 00:10:01,236
Which one is he?

87
00:10:01,256 --> 00:10:03,053
He's over there.

88
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,741
You can't come in.

89
00:10:04,777 --> 00:10:07,245
So how am I to see him
if you won't let me through?

90
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,267
You must wait for him
to come out.

91
00:10:09,256 --> 00:10:10,245
And when will he
come out?

92
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,440
There's no way
of knowing that.

93
00:10:11,463 --> 00:10:15,024
I had less trouble
than this boarding
a Spanish ship.

94
00:10:16,904 --> 00:10:21,000
What if enemy ships
should sail up the Thames,
can the docks be closed?

95
00:10:20,903 --> 00:10:23,030
Not closed, Majesty.
But the gun positions...

96
00:10:23,015 --> 00:10:24,710
Spanish...

97
00:10:29,158 --> 00:10:30,819
Ambassador.

98
00:10:32,871 --> 00:10:34,805
King Eric of Sweden,
Majesty.

99
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:36,088
Not again.

100
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:37,195
Still madly in love with you.

101
00:10:37,222 --> 00:10:38,314
Still mad, you mean.

102
00:10:38,341 --> 00:10:41,401
Lvan, Tsar
of all the Russias.

103
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,817
Where's Bess?

104
00:10:42,854 --> 00:10:45,914
Known as
"lvan the Terrible," Majesty.

105
00:10:52,645 --> 00:10:53,839
Late.

106
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:56,159
I beg
Your Majesty's forgiveness.

107
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:58,254
Given.

108
00:11:01,156 --> 00:11:03,021
Once.

109
00:11:03,012 --> 00:11:06,140
The Archduke
Charles of Austria, Majesty.

110
00:11:09,891 --> 00:11:12,451
The puddle man
is outside, Majesty.

111
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:13,545
My suitors.

112
00:11:13,571 --> 00:11:17,098
Younger brother
to Maximilian II,
Holy Roman Emperor.

113
00:11:17,028 --> 00:11:19,553
Cousin of Philip of Spain.
Wealthy.

114
00:11:19,522 --> 00:11:22,150
He's rather handsome.

115
00:11:24,387 --> 00:11:25,411
How old is he?

116
00:11:25,443 --> 00:11:27,911
Young,
I believe, Majesty.

117
00:11:29,217 --> 00:11:31,515
An Austrian alliance
would keep France quiet.

118
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:33,787
And put Philip on a leash.

119
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:35,695
I've become
almost enthusiastic.

120
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:39,545
Send for him.

121
00:11:39,712 --> 00:11:40,872
<i>Danke schön.</i>

122
00:11:41,953 --> 00:11:45,445
How much longer
do you think I can play
this game, Francis?

123
00:11:45,377 --> 00:11:48,403
Virginity is an asset
that holds its value well.

124
00:11:48,352 --> 00:11:50,286
Walter Raleigh, Majesty.

125
00:11:52,064 --> 00:11:55,192
Your Majesty, this man
is a notorious pirate.

126
00:11:55,136 --> 00:12:00,005
Spanish gold stolen
from Spanish ships,
attacked without provocation.

127
00:12:03,487 --> 00:12:07,082
Well, sir, what do you want?

128
00:12:07,006 --> 00:12:10,169
I have just returned
from the New World, Majesty.

129
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,739
I have claimed
the fertile coast
in your name

130
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:15,433
and called it Virginia

131
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,824
in honor
of our Virgin Queen.

132
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,621
Virginia?

133
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:23,380
And when I marry,
will you change
the name to Conjugia?

134
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,308
I ask your gracious
permission, Majesty,

135
00:12:26,302 --> 00:12:28,998
to return to the New World
with your royal warrant

136
00:12:28,957 --> 00:12:31,926
to found a colony
under the laws
and protections of England.

137
00:12:31,869 --> 00:12:33,131
He wants money.

138
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:35,413
Who are they?

139
00:12:35,389 --> 00:12:37,789
Natives of the
Americas, Majesty.

140
00:12:41,341 --> 00:12:43,036
Have they no ruler
of their own?

141
00:12:43,036 --> 00:12:45,834
None to match
England's Queen.

142
00:12:45,789 --> 00:12:47,279
These gentlemen
are welcome.

143
00:12:47,292 --> 00:12:49,123
See that they
are treated well.

144
00:12:49,116 --> 00:12:51,107
I also come
bearing gifts
for Your Majesty.

145
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,662
These gifts, Majesty,
are the fruits of piracy,

146
00:12:55,547 --> 00:12:57,811
the true property
of the realm of Spain.

147
00:12:57,787 --> 00:13:01,348
Let's see, shall we?
What have you brought me?

148
00:13:09,434 --> 00:13:12,301
<i>Patata, Majesty.</i>

149
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:15,310
You eat it.
Very nourishing.

150
00:13:34,521 --> 00:13:36,113
Tobacco.

151
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:40,308
You breathe its smoke.

152
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,408
Very stimulating.

153
00:13:53,527 --> 00:13:54,926
Gold.

154
00:13:55,574 --> 00:13:59,203
Courtesy of a Spanish ship
that found itself unable
to complete its journey.

155
00:13:59,126 --> 00:14:01,185
Forgive me, Majesty.

156
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:04,906
I find the air
has become stale.

157
00:14:04,821 --> 00:14:08,348
I am sensitive
to the smell
of open sewers.

158
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:19,048
I cannot accept
the fruits of piracy,
Mr. Raleigh.

159
00:14:18,933 --> 00:14:22,733
Philip of Spain is no friend
of England, Majesty.

160
00:14:22,645 --> 00:14:27,014
The more gold I take from him,
the safer you will be.

161
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,425
Well, well.

162
00:14:29,396 --> 00:14:31,330
A political pirate.

163
00:14:31,316 --> 00:14:35,218
And Your Majesty's
most loyal subject.

164
00:14:35,347 --> 00:14:39,215
Welcome home, Mr. Raleigh.
Lord Howard, the docks.

165
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,888
Master Raleigh.

166
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:47,783
You eat it...

167
00:15:09,584 --> 00:15:11,677
You traitor!

168
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:13,550
Judas!

169
00:15:14,096 --> 00:15:16,087
You're Walsingham's pawn!

170
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,804
Don't do this!
I didn't say anything!

171
00:15:20,624 --> 00:15:23,320
You're a
Protestant traitor!

172
00:15:24,111 --> 00:15:25,738
Don't do it! Don't!

173
00:15:35,406 --> 00:15:36,634
Don't!
Hold his head!

174
00:15:36,655 --> 00:15:39,180
You Judas! You Judas!
Stop!

175
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,481
You Judas!

176
00:16:06,444 --> 00:16:09,311
The traitor's dead.
We must act!

177
00:16:13,484 --> 00:16:16,920
Why do we not strike?
What are we waiting for?

178
00:16:19,723 --> 00:16:22,783
You wait for my order.

179
00:16:25,707 --> 00:16:30,440
Walsingham knows
too much already.
One traitor is dead.

180
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:33,988
Who can I trust now?

181
00:16:40,842 --> 00:16:43,242
There's a visitor
waiting, sir.

182
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,988
William.

183
00:16:51,881 --> 00:16:53,849
Hello, Francis.

184
00:16:53,832 --> 00:16:57,324
You've always
been a fellow who
delighted in surprises.

185
00:16:57,256 --> 00:16:59,156
You look well,
Francis.

186
00:16:59,176 --> 00:17:03,169
Well, you look dreadful.
They're not feeding
you in Paris.

187
00:17:03,111 --> 00:17:06,547
You can't learn
the secrets of the universe
on an empty stomach.

188
00:17:06,888 --> 00:17:10,722
<i>Then she my heart beguiled</i>

189
00:17:10,632 --> 00:17:15,092
Mary. William.
Supper is ready.

190
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:18,408
William.

191
00:17:18,407 --> 00:17:19,897
Have you spoken
to the Queen?

192
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:21,037
I speak
with the Queen daily.

193
00:17:21,063 --> 00:17:22,997
You work too hard.
You're a sick man.

194
00:17:22,982 --> 00:17:24,609
William,
come over here
and sit by me.

195
00:17:24,614 --> 00:17:26,013
William, if we are not
allowed to sin,

196
00:17:26,022 --> 00:17:27,216
maybe we could
talk theology.

197
00:17:27,238 --> 00:17:30,139
You have done enough.
No man could do more.

198
00:17:30,086 --> 00:17:32,316
I can't leave
the court yet, Ursula.
She needs me.

199
00:17:32,294 --> 00:17:33,989
Never listens to me.
Not a thought for his health.

200
00:17:33,989 --> 00:17:35,388
So you talk to him,
he's your brother.

201
00:17:35,397 --> 00:17:39,299
William, what do they say
in Paris about the Pope's
call for holy war?

202
00:17:39,206 --> 00:17:40,230
Many welcome it.

203
00:17:40,261 --> 00:17:41,990
Why must we talk
about war?

204
00:17:41,989 --> 00:17:44,184
Tell us your nice
news, William.

205
00:17:44,165 --> 00:17:46,292
Are you married yet?
Not yet.

206
00:17:46,277 --> 00:17:48,541
Mary, would you leave
William alone, please?

207
00:17:48,517 --> 00:17:51,281
Sweet, sit.

208
00:17:52,484 --> 00:17:53,644
Grace?

209
00:17:54,756 --> 00:17:56,747
Oh, Lord,
provider of all things,

210
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,731
we offer Thee
our humble thanks.

211
00:17:58,724 --> 00:18:01,625
In the name
of the Holy Trinity, amen.

212
00:18:01,571 --> 00:18:02,697
Amen.

213
00:18:11,107 --> 00:18:14,167
More lines on my face.

214
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,322
Where do they come from?

215
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:20,433
Smile lines, my lady.

216
00:18:20,417 --> 00:18:22,715
Smile lines?

217
00:18:23,714 --> 00:18:26,444
When do I ever smile?

218
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,871
Now you have
smile lines, too.

219
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:42,687
<i>The beauty of Your Majesty</i>

220
00:18:42,528 --> 00:18:46,897
<i>is dazzling to my eyes.</i>

221
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:57,742
I am overwhelmed.

222
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:01,099
I am conquered.

223
00:19:01,023 --> 00:19:03,583
I die.

224
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:06,577
Only your love,

225
00:19:06,527 --> 00:19:09,155
<i>my stattlich Elizabeth,</i>

226
00:19:09,118 --> 00:19:11,245
can restore me into life.

227
00:19:12,254 --> 00:19:15,314
Your Highness
does me great honor.

228
00:19:23,485 --> 00:19:25,680
Oh, Elizabeth.

229
00:19:25,821 --> 00:19:31,157
How blessed am I
to stand in your
fabled presence.

230
00:19:32,189 --> 00:19:34,680
Ah, Elizabeth.

231
00:19:34,652 --> 00:19:36,916
To speak your name
is to hear celestial music.

232
00:19:40,476 --> 00:19:43,968
May that sweet sound

233
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,700
guide me through my life
to come, Elizabeth.

234
00:19:48,731 --> 00:19:53,395
I have traveled here
to this illustrious court

235
00:19:53,403 --> 00:19:57,339
in the hope that
our two great nations

236
00:19:58,427 --> 00:20:00,827
might be
joined in love.

237
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:16,162
He interests me.

238
00:20:18,266 --> 00:20:20,325
Talk to him.

239
00:20:20,312 --> 00:20:23,509
Him, my lady?

240
00:20:23,448 --> 00:20:24,608
Him.

241
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:33,005
I adore the natives
you brought. I don't suppose
you could get one for me.

242
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,353
They're not
dangerous, are they?

243
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,191
That depends
on what you propose
to do with them.

244
00:20:36,184 --> 00:20:38,652
I'd dress him up
in mulberry
colored silk,

245
00:20:38,615 --> 00:20:41,550
and have him walk
behind me,
carrying my cloak.

246
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:51,670
I have a secret,
my dear.

247
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,963
I pretend there's
a pane of glass,

248
00:20:55,926 --> 00:20:59,885
<i>eine Glasscheibe
between me and them.</i>

249
00:21:01,622 --> 00:21:05,183
They can see me,
but they cannot touch me.

250
00:21:07,062 --> 00:21:09,189
You should try it.

251
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,941
Majesty, I am...

252
00:21:23,508 --> 00:21:25,373
It is something,
after all,

253
00:21:25,364 --> 00:21:30,802
to take a blank on the map
and build there
a shining city.

254
00:21:30,643 --> 00:21:34,204
Which you will no doubt
name after yourself.

255
00:21:34,131 --> 00:21:35,598
No doubt.

256
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,635
May I ask
a question in return?

257
00:21:44,626 --> 00:21:45,650
Of course.

258
00:21:45,682 --> 00:21:47,946
How am I to win
the Queen's favor?

259
00:21:47,922 --> 00:21:49,389
Why should I tell you that?

260
00:21:49,394 --> 00:21:52,727
I've little enough to offer,
but whatever I have to give,

261
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:56,584
ask, and it's yours.

262
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:01,874
Say what you mean to say
as plainly as possible.

263
00:22:02,481 --> 00:22:06,110
All men flatter the Queen
in hope of advancement.

264
00:22:08,209 --> 00:22:10,643
Pay her the compliment
of truth.

265
00:22:10,608 --> 00:22:12,439
I don't even know
your name.

266
00:22:12,976 --> 00:22:14,000
Elizabeth Throckmorton.

267
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:16,000
A second
Elizabeth?

268
00:22:15,985 --> 00:22:18,215
Everyone calls me Bess.

269
00:22:18,191 --> 00:22:23,185
Your most serene Majesty,
bright star of our firmament,

270
00:22:23,056 --> 00:22:27,959
we present our humble masque
of the heavenly spheres.

271
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:33,375
His Highness is tired
after his long journey.

272
00:22:33,326 --> 00:22:36,386
No man
can become tired

273
00:22:36,334 --> 00:22:40,202
in the presence of
so lovely a queen.

274
00:23:11,788 --> 00:23:16,487
His Highness, the Archduke
informs me that my charms
overwhelm him.

275
00:23:16,363 --> 00:23:20,129
He will retire
to his private chambers
to rest.

276
00:23:27,914 --> 00:23:31,281
I don't want him hurt
by your schemes.

277
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:33,804
So how should
we proceed?

278
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:36,000
Perhaps we should
all retire.

279
00:23:38,473 --> 00:23:42,637
I suspect him of being
a professional charmer.

280
00:23:42,537 --> 00:23:43,697
Am I right?

281
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:46,656
He is certainly
charming, my lady.

282
00:23:47,017 --> 00:23:49,986
Well, there are
duller professions.

283
00:23:50,984 --> 00:23:52,849
You like him, don't you?

284
00:23:52,841 --> 00:23:55,332
He's a man
that lives in a world
far beyond the court.

285
00:23:56,872 --> 00:23:59,340
It's refreshing.

286
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:01,067
Well.

287
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:03,191
We shall let him
come again.

288
00:24:04,328 --> 00:24:05,420
Blue.

289
00:24:11,175 --> 00:24:14,338
<i>Can you imagine
what it is to cross an ocean?</i>

290
00:24:15,015 --> 00:24:20,214
For weeks, you see nothing
but the horizon,
perfect and empty.

291
00:24:21,542 --> 00:24:24,511
You live in the grip of fear.

292
00:24:24,677 --> 00:24:26,201
Fear of storms.

293
00:24:27,238 --> 00:24:29,638
Fear of sickness on board.

294
00:24:30,501 --> 00:24:33,061
Fear of the immensity.

295
00:24:34,085 --> 00:24:37,521
So you must drive
that fear down deep
into your belly.

296
00:24:38,533 --> 00:24:40,433
Study your charts.

297
00:24:41,092 --> 00:24:42,992
Watch your compass.

298
00:24:43,653 --> 00:24:45,746
Pray for a fair wind.

299
00:24:46,884 --> 00:24:49,182
And hope,

300
00:24:50,212 --> 00:24:51,372
pure,

301
00:24:51,972 --> 00:24:53,439
naked,

302
00:24:54,019 --> 00:24:55,748
fragile

303
00:24:56,707 --> 00:24:58,572
hope.

304
00:25:00,675 --> 00:25:03,109
Majesty, the Archduke
and court are waiting.

305
00:25:03,075 --> 00:25:04,975
Let them wait.

306
00:25:06,306 --> 00:25:08,365
Go on, Mr. Raleigh.

307
00:25:09,794 --> 00:25:12,354
You were hoping.

308
00:25:12,547 --> 00:25:15,914
At first,
it's no more than
a haze on the horizon.

309
00:25:20,898 --> 00:25:22,798
So you watch.

310
00:25:25,537 --> 00:25:27,266
You watch.

311
00:25:31,393 --> 00:25:33,452
Then it's a smudge,

312
00:25:35,136 --> 00:25:38,105
a shadow on the far water.

313
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,937
For a day.

314
00:25:41,761 --> 00:25:43,661
For another day.

315
00:25:45,407 --> 00:25:51,004
The stain slowly spreads
along the horizon taking form,

316
00:25:52,064 --> 00:25:56,933
until on the third day,
you let yourself believe.

317
00:25:58,335 --> 00:26:01,031
You dare to whisper
the word.

318
00:26:02,271 --> 00:26:03,898
Land.

319
00:26:06,494 --> 00:26:07,893
Land.

320
00:26:08,574 --> 00:26:10,064
Life.

321
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:13,127
Resurrection.

322
00:26:14,013 --> 00:26:16,675
The true adventure.

323
00:26:17,373 --> 00:26:20,365
Coming out of
the vast unknown,

324
00:26:20,318 --> 00:26:22,513
out of the immensity,

325
00:26:23,452 --> 00:26:25,784
into new life.

326
00:26:28,412 --> 00:26:29,743
That,

327
00:26:30,844 --> 00:26:33,870
Your Majesty,
is the New World.

328
00:26:43,387 --> 00:26:46,788
I like
your immensities.

329
00:26:46,715 --> 00:26:53,052
Your ocean is an image
of eternity, I think.

330
00:26:52,858 --> 00:26:57,318
Such great spaces
make us small.

331
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:01,010
Do we discover
the New World,
Mr. Raleigh,

332
00:27:00,922 --> 00:27:04,414
or does the New World
discover us?

333
00:27:04,345 --> 00:27:07,178
You speak like
a true explorer.

334
00:27:08,537 --> 00:27:10,505
I like you,
Mr. Raleigh.

335
00:27:14,201 --> 00:27:16,567
And I like you.

336
00:27:23,256 --> 00:27:27,784
You know, of course,
that when I like a man,
I reward him.

337
00:27:27,672 --> 00:27:30,937
I have heard that.

338
00:27:30,904 --> 00:27:32,769
And what have you
to say about it?

339
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:35,125
Reward my mission,
Majesty, not me.

340
00:27:35,095 --> 00:27:37,393
Is the mission
not the man?

341
00:27:37,367 --> 00:27:40,302
Then you leave me free
to like you in return.

342
00:27:46,103 --> 00:27:47,798
Go on.

343
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:52,535
I think it must be hard
for so great a queen

344
00:27:52,502 --> 00:27:56,404
to know the simple pleasure
of being liked for herself.

345
00:28:02,324 --> 00:28:04,383
Now you grow dull.

346
00:28:39,891 --> 00:28:41,358
Come on!

347
00:29:07,056 --> 00:29:08,648
Mine.

348
00:29:10,127 --> 00:29:12,254
You have
the stronger horse.

349
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,105
Yours carries
the lighter load.

350
00:29:14,096 --> 00:29:15,529
No.

351
00:29:16,815 --> 00:29:19,113
The Queen does not
give way to others.

352
00:29:20,463 --> 00:29:22,226
Whoa! Whoa!

353
00:29:28,911 --> 00:29:32,779
Forgive me, Majesty.
My horse doesn't seem
to know his place yet.

354
00:29:34,318 --> 00:29:37,287
Have you ever
known your place,
Mr. Raleigh?

355
00:29:41,101 --> 00:29:43,035
Oh, come on!

356
00:30:13,259 --> 00:30:14,817
It's from her.

357
00:30:15,691 --> 00:30:19,354
Mary Stuart
is the heart and soul
of our enterprise.

358
00:30:31,593 --> 00:30:34,426
Make sure she
and only she reads this.

359
00:30:34,761 --> 00:30:36,820
We wait for her order.

360
00:30:38,408 --> 00:30:40,876
The order
must be given clearly.

361
00:30:49,544 --> 00:30:51,409
The jailer, madam.

362
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,339
My noble jailer.

363
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:02,197
Am I a danger to England
even when I pray?

364
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:05,416
As always, ma'am,
my concern
is for your safety.

365
00:31:08,486 --> 00:31:10,920
I pray for
my cousin Elizabeth.

366
00:31:13,478 --> 00:31:15,878
Do you think
she prays for me?

367
00:31:23,686 --> 00:31:25,153
Is it true

368
00:31:26,693 --> 00:31:30,527
that I've never known
the pleasure of being
liked for myself?

369
00:31:32,773 --> 00:31:36,072
I hope you believe
I like you for yourself,
my lady.

370
00:31:38,116 --> 00:31:43,019
Is anyone ever liked
simply for themselves?
I doubt it.

371
00:31:43,876 --> 00:31:45,639
Are you?

372
00:31:47,044 --> 00:31:51,208
Men like you
because you're pretty,

373
00:31:52,963 --> 00:31:56,455
and because you have
the ear of the Queen.

374
00:31:56,419 --> 00:31:58,887
No doubt.

375
00:32:00,098 --> 00:32:02,191
Him, too.

376
00:32:04,803 --> 00:32:07,499
He likes you because
he wants my favor.

377
00:32:10,402 --> 00:32:13,303
You do realize that.

378
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:17,161
Yes, my lady.

379
00:32:18,849 --> 00:32:21,943
And the other thing,
too, of course.

380
00:32:21,889 --> 00:32:23,754
But then,
all men want that.

381
00:32:23,745 --> 00:32:27,078
Male desire
confers no distinction.

382
00:32:28,512 --> 00:32:31,106
Oh, I envy you, Bess.

383
00:32:34,081 --> 00:32:37,608
You're free to have
what I cannot have.

384
00:32:39,295 --> 00:32:41,092
You're my adventurer.

385
00:33:29,532 --> 00:33:31,124
Thank you for coming.

386
00:33:31,131 --> 00:33:33,725
You mustn't send
letters to the palace.

387
00:33:33,692 --> 00:33:35,387
You know
what would happen
if I was caught.

388
00:33:35,387 --> 00:33:37,287
I need your help.

389
00:33:38,395 --> 00:33:40,659
More money?
No.

390
00:33:41,915 --> 00:33:43,906
My father doesn't
want to hide
like this anymore.

391
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:44,888
Of course.

392
00:33:44,923 --> 00:33:47,221
We both want to get
back into favor
with the court.

393
00:33:47,194 --> 00:33:48,718
That's impossible.

394
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:50,788
You know that
you're Papists.

395
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:52,175
Why impossible?

396
00:33:52,187 --> 00:33:54,781
Everyone at court
has a Papist somewhere
in their family.

397
00:33:54,746 --> 00:33:56,179
Francis.
Just as you have.

398
00:33:56,185 --> 00:33:59,154
Speak to the Queen.
You are her favorite.

399
00:33:59,098 --> 00:34:02,659
My father and I
will embrace the new faith.

400
00:34:02,586 --> 00:34:03,746
Cousin Bess.
No.

401
00:34:03,769 --> 00:34:05,760
We have known
each other
all our lives.

402
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:08,846
I would do nothing
to harm you.

403
00:34:09,432 --> 00:34:12,196
Why can't you help us?
They will kill us!

404
00:34:24,152 --> 00:34:28,486
Oh. Do not tease me,
Mr. Raleigh.

405
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:30,741
There's nothing
I'd like to do more.

406
00:34:30,711 --> 00:34:31,973
So why don't you?

407
00:34:33,943 --> 00:34:36,571
All right, then. I will.

408
00:34:38,615 --> 00:34:40,776
You see? You lie.

409
00:34:40,758 --> 00:34:43,784
You don't want me
on your ship at all.
You're a liar.

410
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:49,205
Bess. Would you
like to go to sea?

411
00:34:49,206 --> 00:34:50,798
I'm afraid
that's not possible.

412
00:34:50,805 --> 00:34:53,638
Women bring bad luck
on board ship.

413
00:34:53,589 --> 00:34:54,851
Do they?

414
00:34:54,869 --> 00:34:57,269
Lock up a hundred men
in a space smaller
than this room

415
00:34:57,237 --> 00:34:59,501
for months at a time.

416
00:34:59,477 --> 00:35:00,739
Men have needs.

417
00:35:00,757 --> 00:35:03,487
A beautiful woman
would drive us all mad.

418
00:35:04,212 --> 00:35:06,373
Men have needs?

419
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:13,511
Let them stay on land
and see to their needs.

420
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:18,005
Mr. Raleigh
is eager to sail away
to his maiden colony.

421
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:23,004
We must persuade him
to stay a little longer.
Mustn't we, ladies?

422
00:35:38,641 --> 00:35:40,074
Bess?

423
00:35:44,657 --> 00:35:45,646
No!

424
00:35:45,937 --> 00:35:49,668
Wait! What do you want?
Who are you?

425
00:35:49,585 --> 00:35:53,351
Let me go, damn it!
Who the hell are you?

426
00:36:18,799 --> 00:36:23,259
If you won't assist me,
perhaps your father will.

427
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,742
No.

428
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,620
Enough.

429
00:36:31,598 --> 00:36:33,259
Enough.

430
00:36:34,285 --> 00:36:35,946
Enough.

431
00:36:36,877 --> 00:36:38,276
Yes?

432
00:36:40,077 --> 00:36:43,535
You cannot
save England now.

433
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:46,760
The Enterprise
has begun.

434
00:36:50,317 --> 00:36:52,581
Ambassador?

435
00:36:54,252 --> 00:36:55,981
What do you know
of the Enterprise
of England?

436
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,175
The Enterprise?
Forgive me, Majesty,
I'm not familiar...

437
00:36:58,156 --> 00:37:01,592
Two armies landing
on the coasts
of Sussex and Norfolk.

438
00:37:01,516 --> 00:37:04,451
Mary Stuart is to be
set free and placed
on the English throne,

439
00:37:04,395 --> 00:37:06,192
and I am to be
assassinated.

440
00:37:06,187 --> 00:37:07,620
Does any of this
sound familiar?

441
00:37:07,627 --> 00:37:08,855
I know nothing
of any invasion plans...

442
00:37:08,875 --> 00:37:11,036
Well, I refer to
this plan as the
Enterprise of England,

443
00:37:11,019 --> 00:37:13,988
<i>it should more
accurately be called
la Empresa de Inglaterra</i>

444
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,727
because it is
a Spanish plan.

445
00:37:15,722 --> 00:37:17,622
The plan of my
one-time brother-in-law,

446
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:19,476
your king,
to attack my country.

447
00:37:19,466 --> 00:37:23,596
Your country?
It is my country
that is under attack.

448
00:37:24,586 --> 00:37:27,646
<i>Your so-called piratas,
your pirates attack
our merchant ships daily.</i>

449
00:37:27,593 --> 00:37:31,927
And you...
You think we don't know
where the orders come from?

450
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:34,614
The whole world knows
these pirates sail up
the Thames,

451
00:37:34,569 --> 00:37:38,369
all the way
to your royal bed.

452
00:37:46,184 --> 00:37:50,518
You will leave
my presence, sir.

453
00:37:50,408 --> 00:37:53,241
Go back to your rat hole.

454
00:37:53,255 --> 00:37:58,591
Tell Philip I fear
neither him, nor his priests,
nor his armies.

455
00:37:58,439 --> 00:38:00,805
Tell him if he wants to shake
his little fist at us,

456
00:38:00,774 --> 00:38:02,002
we're ready to give him
such a bite,

457
00:38:02,023 --> 00:38:03,820
he'll wish he'd kept his hands
in his pockets.

458
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:07,875
You see a leaf fall
and you think you know
which way the wind blows.

459
00:38:07,783 --> 00:38:12,516
Well, there is
a wind coming, madam,

460
00:38:12,389 --> 00:38:14,687
that will sweep away
your pride.

461
00:38:20,645 --> 00:38:23,170
I, too, can command
the wind, sir!

462
00:38:23,141 --> 00:38:27,669
I have a hurricane in me
that will strip Spain bare
if you dare to try me!

463
00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:51,070
What are you staring at?

464
00:38:51,042 --> 00:38:54,637
Lower your eyes.
I am the Queen!

465
00:38:55,394 --> 00:38:58,625
You are not my equal, sir,
and you never will be!

466
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:17,812
<i>The alignments of the planets
is most unusual this year.</i>

467
00:40:18,812 --> 00:40:20,780
Mars is due to take
the ascendant

468
00:40:20,763 --> 00:40:24,859
three days
after the anniversary
of Your Majesty's birth.

469
00:40:24,764 --> 00:40:28,200
And also on that day,
there is a full moon,

470
00:40:28,124 --> 00:40:33,289
which governs
the fortune of all princes
of the female gender.

471
00:40:33,147 --> 00:40:35,240
Princes of the
female gender.

472
00:40:35,227 --> 00:40:39,926
I mean to say,
a prince who is
also a woman.

473
00:40:39,803 --> 00:40:43,239
Yes, Dr. Dee,
I am following you.

474
00:40:43,162 --> 00:40:45,323
What does it mean?

475
00:40:45,307 --> 00:40:52,179
It means the rise
of a great empire, Majesty,
and the fall of another.

476
00:40:52,634 --> 00:40:54,067
Convulsions.

477
00:40:57,401 --> 00:41:01,565
Which empire is to rise
and which is to fall?

478
00:41:01,465 --> 00:41:03,695
That I cannot say,
Majesty.

479
00:41:03,673 --> 00:41:07,734
Astrology is,
as yet, more an art
than a science.

480
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,074
Nothing more, Dr. Dee?

481
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,668
No more specific calamities
we can guard against?

482
00:41:12,632 --> 00:41:17,035
He means,
will I be assassinated?

483
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,821
Walsingham, would you
leave us for a moment?

484
00:41:26,295 --> 00:41:31,699
And the private life
of this prince
of the female gender,

485
00:41:31,542 --> 00:41:33,703
what do the stars
foretell there?

486
00:41:33,686 --> 00:41:36,484
These are matters
of state, Majesty.

487
00:41:36,439 --> 00:41:40,569
Surely the stars
foretell matters
of state, Dr. Dee.

488
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:45,908
For such a prediction
I must look
in a different chart.

489
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:56,670
Wonderful.

490
00:41:57,716 --> 00:41:59,877
Such strength.

491
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:03,953
You will need
all your strength
in the days to come.

492
00:42:04,596 --> 00:42:08,623
But you doubt yourself,
my child.

493
00:42:08,916 --> 00:42:12,682
I have not seen
fear in your face
for such a long time.

494
00:42:12,883 --> 00:42:14,077
Have I reason to fear?

495
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:16,329
Something has
weakened you.

496
00:42:17,842 --> 00:42:21,005
There are
hard days coming.

497
00:42:24,787 --> 00:42:27,085
But I am no prophet.

498
00:42:27,634 --> 00:42:31,070
I see no more
than the shadows
of ghosts.

499
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:36,898
Visitor, sir.

500
00:42:48,048 --> 00:42:49,276
Sorry to come
aboard your ship

501
00:42:49,296 --> 00:42:51,457
without permission,
Mr. Raleigh.

502
00:43:00,975 --> 00:43:03,068
Welcome aboard.

503
00:43:03,759 --> 00:43:05,886
The Queen wishes
to see you.

504
00:43:08,494 --> 00:43:09,756
She asks me
to assure you...

505
00:43:09,775 --> 00:43:11,868
I need
no assurances, Bess.

506
00:43:13,135 --> 00:43:15,729
I'm no courtier.
Never have been.

507
00:43:15,694 --> 00:43:18,185
Then you should
say so in person.

508
00:43:25,614 --> 00:43:27,878
This is
my life, Bess.

509
00:43:29,198 --> 00:43:31,098
This is where
I belong.

510
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:36,944
It seems to be
a lonely life.

511
00:43:36,908 --> 00:43:40,810
Sometimes.
But it's the life
I've chosen.

512
00:43:43,981 --> 00:43:46,006
I understand.

513
00:44:00,843 --> 00:44:03,368
You ask permission to go.

514
00:44:03,339 --> 00:44:05,307
Yes, Majesty.

515
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:08,748
You plan to return
to your colony

516
00:44:08,682 --> 00:44:13,142
for two, maybe three,
four years.

517
00:44:13,034 --> 00:44:16,470
If Your Majesty grants me
your royal warrant.

518
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:19,690
That is a long time.

519
00:44:19,658 --> 00:44:22,957
There's nothing
for me here.

520
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:26,326
At sea,
I know what I'm to do.
I know the risks.

521
00:44:26,248 --> 00:44:28,580
Here...
No. You're wrong.

522
00:44:28,553 --> 00:44:31,989
You're needed here.

523
00:44:31,912 --> 00:44:33,709
As captain of my
personal guard.

524
00:44:33,705 --> 00:44:35,002
Captain of your guard?

525
00:44:35,016 --> 00:44:36,005
Kneel.

526
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,530
Majesty.

527
00:44:37,544 --> 00:44:39,944
I said, kneel.

528
00:44:44,391 --> 00:44:46,985
Sir Walter Raleigh.

529
00:44:51,207 --> 00:44:56,941
Well, you may express
your gratitude.

530
00:44:59,014 --> 00:45:02,142
This is too great an honor.

531
00:45:02,726 --> 00:45:06,457
If it's so great an honor,
why are you staring
at your boots?

532
00:45:07,014 --> 00:45:08,675
You know why.

533
00:45:09,797 --> 00:45:11,856
Now you stare
at the wall.

534
00:45:11,846 --> 00:45:14,178
Am I so hideous
you can't even look
me in the face?

535
00:45:14,148 --> 00:45:15,172
Why do you speak
like a fool

536
00:45:15,204 --> 00:45:18,264
when you are anything
but a fool?

537
00:45:18,213 --> 00:45:19,805
Fool?

538
00:45:21,957 --> 00:45:25,484
Yes, I am a vain
and foolish woman.

539
00:45:25,412 --> 00:45:28,472
And you, you...
You come here

540
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:31,753
as if from another time.
And I've...

541
00:45:33,636 --> 00:45:38,300
You have real adventures.
You go where the maps end.
And I'd...

542
00:45:38,948 --> 00:45:42,941
I would follow you there
if I could. Believe me.

543
00:45:52,866 --> 00:45:56,632
The storm clouds
are gathering.
You are needed here.

544
00:45:57,954 --> 00:46:00,013
You cannot leave England.

545
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:33,271
"For he that will
save his life
will lose it.

546
00:46:33,279 --> 00:46:37,375
<i>"And he that will
lose his life for my sake
shall find it. "</i>

547
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:41,330
Lord be with us
as the end approaches.

548
00:46:43,326 --> 00:46:46,887
We will not fear the coming
of the shadow of death.

549
00:47:05,404 --> 00:47:08,635
Sorry, I didn't mean
to disturb you.

550
00:47:08,573 --> 00:47:10,973
I thought I prayed
in silence.

551
00:47:10,941 --> 00:47:12,169
You did.

552
00:47:21,148 --> 00:47:24,606
Excuse me, sir.
I must go to the Queen.

553
00:47:24,539 --> 00:47:27,736
The man who was
hanged today...

554
00:47:27,675 --> 00:47:30,200
He was your cousin.

555
00:47:33,082 --> 00:47:34,879
Yes.

556
00:47:34,874 --> 00:47:36,842
I'm sorry.

557
00:47:43,322 --> 00:47:45,483
The last time
I saw him,

558
00:47:47,193 --> 00:47:49,093
he needed my help.

559
00:47:51,097 --> 00:47:52,792
I did nothing.

560
00:47:52,792 --> 00:47:54,487
What could
you have done?

561
00:47:55,801 --> 00:47:57,928
I don't know.

562
00:47:58,648 --> 00:48:01,048
Now he's dead.

563
00:48:01,016 --> 00:48:05,885
I keep seeing his face.
I keep seeing his eyes.

564
00:48:05,752 --> 00:48:08,949
Believe me, there's nothing
that you could have done
that would have spared him.

565
00:48:08,888 --> 00:48:10,480
I'm so afraid.

566
00:48:10,488 --> 00:48:12,615
We're all human, Bess.

567
00:48:13,719 --> 00:48:16,415
We do what we can.

568
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:06,920
<i>Your laundress
was found to be carrying
letters in her washing.</i>

569
00:49:07,763 --> 00:49:09,754
Not her job, I think.

570
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:11,976
How am I to send
my intimate letters?

571
00:49:11,954 --> 00:49:14,582
Through me.
And you will read them.

572
00:49:14,547 --> 00:49:17,516
With respectful
admiration.

573
00:49:17,491 --> 00:49:20,085
Am I to have
no privacy?

574
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:21,074
No.

575
00:49:21,106 --> 00:49:22,733
You disappoint me, sir.

576
00:49:23,602 --> 00:49:26,196
The Queen orders
these measures
for your protection.

577
00:49:26,162 --> 00:49:27,595
The Queen?

578
00:49:27,602 --> 00:49:29,661
I am a queen.

579
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,216
They call her
the Virgin Queen.

580
00:49:45,489 --> 00:49:47,116
Why is that, sir?

581
00:49:48,273 --> 00:49:51,174
Can it be that no man
will have her?

582
00:51:20,584 --> 00:51:23,109
Let him
throw you round.

583
00:51:23,081 --> 00:51:25,845
Be bold. Come on,
you can trust him.

584
00:51:25,801 --> 00:51:27,632
And jump.

585
00:51:27,624 --> 00:51:31,116
When I bend like this,
you take a leap
into the air.

586
00:51:32,296 --> 00:51:34,230
The Volta.

587
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:36,650
I require all my ladies
to learn it.

588
00:51:37,447 --> 00:51:40,245
You see
how fearless Bess is?

589
00:51:40,199 --> 00:51:42,895
You like your ladies
to jump at your command.

590
00:51:42,887 --> 00:51:43,911
Do you think
that wrong?

591
00:51:43,943 --> 00:51:47,140
No. You are the Queen.
You are to be obeyed.

592
00:51:47,974 --> 00:51:50,272
To tell you
the truth,

593
00:51:50,246 --> 00:51:52,476
I'm very, very tired
of always being
in control.

594
00:51:52,455 --> 00:51:54,446
Nonsense.

595
00:51:54,438 --> 00:51:56,736
What?

596
00:51:56,710 --> 00:52:00,510
You eat and
drink control.

597
00:52:00,422 --> 00:52:03,118
Is that so?

598
00:52:05,638 --> 00:52:06,969
Bess.

599
00:52:06,981 --> 00:52:09,279
You should try a dance
with Sir Walter.

600
00:52:09,253 --> 00:52:11,551
He's eager
to show us his skill.

601
00:52:11,525 --> 00:52:15,188
No skill at all, Majesty.
I don't know the steps.

602
00:52:15,109 --> 00:52:17,304
Come now.

603
00:52:22,565 --> 00:52:25,591
You stand
like this,

604
00:52:25,541 --> 00:52:29,033
with your hands here.

605
00:52:28,963 --> 00:52:30,521
And when she jumps,

606
00:52:30,531 --> 00:52:34,058
on the fifth step,

607
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:36,638
you lift her.

608
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:38,476
What could be simpler?

609
00:52:41,826 --> 00:52:44,624
Take your position,
Sir Walter.

610
00:52:46,242 --> 00:52:47,641
I am to be obeyed.

611
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:52,120
As Your Majesty
wishes.

612
00:52:54,242 --> 00:52:57,473
Hold her firmly.
I don't want her dropped.

613
00:53:04,737 --> 00:53:06,705
Play.

614
00:53:06,752 --> 00:53:08,083
Six counts.

615
00:53:08,096 --> 00:53:11,361
One, two, three,
and lift, down.

616
00:53:46,525 --> 00:53:48,891
Leave us.

617
00:53:50,237 --> 00:53:52,535
I want both of them
left alone.

618
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,033
Madam.

619
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:15,831
I must reply.

620
00:55:17,846 --> 00:55:19,677
"If our forces
are in readiness,

621
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:23,003
"both within and without
the realm,

622
00:55:22,935 --> 00:55:28,771
"then your Queen commands you
to set the gentlemen to work."

623
00:55:28,597 --> 00:55:30,428
I think we have it.

624
00:55:37,205 --> 00:55:38,604
Yes.

625
00:55:43,892 --> 00:55:46,554
Let God's
work begin.

626
00:55:59,604 --> 00:56:00,662
Where have you been?

627
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:03,319
I met up
with some old friends.

628
00:56:03,283 --> 00:56:05,581
From Paris, no doubt.

629
00:56:05,555 --> 00:56:07,489
We haven't
seen you for days.

630
00:56:07,475 --> 00:56:09,067
Yes.

631
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:11,042
Now you're back.

632
00:56:15,730 --> 00:56:20,394
Do you know,
I can still remember
the day you were born.

633
00:56:22,321 --> 00:56:25,256
I was 11 years old.

634
00:56:26,705 --> 00:56:30,436
And you,
this helpless bundle.

635
00:56:30,385 --> 00:56:32,250
I looked at you
in your crib,

636
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:35,403
with your little,
wrinkled face,

637
00:56:35,344 --> 00:56:37,676
and I loved you
from the first.

638
00:56:39,632 --> 00:56:42,123
I've failed you,
haven't I?

639
00:56:43,087 --> 00:56:46,352
Forgive me
if I haven't
loved you enough.

640
00:56:56,143 --> 00:56:59,169
Did you imagine
I wouldn't know?

641
00:57:04,814 --> 00:57:07,282
Your blessing,
Majesty. My little one.

642
00:57:07,246 --> 00:57:08,873
Your blessing?

643
00:57:17,581 --> 00:57:19,412
Walk on.

644
00:57:35,563 --> 00:57:38,361
The Queen is at her prayers.

645
00:57:47,019 --> 00:57:48,714
Go!

646
00:57:49,643 --> 00:57:54,137
Elizabeth is a whore!
Mary Stuart is our
true queen!

647
00:57:55,978 --> 00:57:58,446
Elizabeth!

648
00:58:01,097 --> 00:58:03,224
Whore!

649
00:59:11,428 --> 00:59:13,089
You bring news?

650
00:59:17,349 --> 00:59:19,874
The Queen
has been attacked.

651
00:59:21,571 --> 00:59:24,267
The assassin seized.

652
00:59:28,995 --> 00:59:30,462
The Queen

653
00:59:32,451 --> 00:59:34,078
unharmed.

654
00:59:35,202 --> 00:59:36,226
Unharmed?

655
00:59:36,258 --> 00:59:41,491
And you, ma'am,
are to be tried
for treason.

656
00:59:47,362 --> 00:59:49,262
Me?

657
00:59:51,137 --> 00:59:54,595
What has any of this
to do with me?

658
01:00:00,256 --> 01:00:03,384
That's the trouble
with intrigues, isn't it?

659
01:00:03,329 --> 01:00:04,489
With so many secrets,

660
01:00:04,512 --> 01:00:08,175
you can never quite be sure
who's on whose side
till the game ends.

661
01:00:16,672 --> 01:00:20,108
Walsingham has every
letter you've written.

662
01:00:24,479 --> 01:00:26,379
Traitor.

663
01:00:32,542 --> 01:00:35,067
Traitors!

664
01:01:11,803 --> 01:01:14,271
Ready to die,
I see, Jesuit.

665
01:01:14,235 --> 01:01:16,601
I have done what
I was sent to do.

666
01:01:17,818 --> 01:01:20,252
Why was the gun
not loaded?

667
01:01:37,401 --> 01:01:40,234
I need your help.

668
01:01:43,801 --> 01:01:46,793
I, too,
have failed, brother.

669
01:01:47,448 --> 01:01:49,416
What was the Jesuit
sent to do?

670
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:52,130
I told you everything I know.

671
01:01:53,048 --> 01:01:54,913
So kill me.

672
01:01:57,112 --> 01:01:59,876
There's a better world
waiting for me.

673
01:02:02,775 --> 01:02:05,608
We'll all be judged
in the end, brother.

674
01:02:06,870 --> 01:02:08,462
Even you.

675
01:02:09,175 --> 01:02:12,736
William, you're
not a martyr.

676
01:02:14,327 --> 01:02:16,795
You weren't even
much of a murderer.

677
01:02:21,174 --> 01:02:23,904
I'm going to have you
taken to France.

678
01:02:25,142 --> 01:02:27,610
No one will know.

679
01:02:28,981 --> 01:02:31,882
You must never let me
hear of you again.

680
01:02:35,285 --> 01:02:37,685
Francis.

681
01:02:37,652 --> 01:02:39,176
Francis!

682
01:02:39,188 --> 01:02:40,883
Francis.

683
01:02:43,029 --> 01:02:45,361
I've never seen her
so distressed.

684
01:02:45,332 --> 01:02:48,824
She's been alone
in her room since morning.
She'll see no one.

685
01:02:48,755 --> 01:02:49,847
Has she asked for me?

686
01:02:49,875 --> 01:02:50,967
No.

687
01:02:50,995 --> 01:02:53,429
But she needs you.
I know she does.

688
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:57,688
Go to her.

689
01:02:57,650 --> 01:03:00,312
Please.

690
01:03:17,937 --> 01:03:21,668
Are you here
to tell me I must
murder a queen?

691
01:03:22,449 --> 01:03:25,816
I would
never presume to tell
my Queen what to do.

692
01:03:25,808 --> 01:03:28,276
Only you know
where your duty lies.

693
01:03:31,825 --> 01:03:34,988
Was it my father's duty
to murder my mother?

694
01:03:36,112 --> 01:03:39,138
She was a queen
for a time.

695
01:03:40,208 --> 01:03:44,235
Oh, I would be
loath to die
so bloody a death.

696
01:03:48,014 --> 01:03:50,915
Since when were you
so afraid?

697
01:03:54,191 --> 01:03:56,386
I'm always afraid.

698
01:03:58,382 --> 01:04:01,977
Kill a queen,
and all queens are mortal.

699
01:04:06,989 --> 01:04:10,049
We mortals have
many weaknesses.

700
01:04:09,997 --> 01:04:11,988
We feel too much.

701
01:04:11,981 --> 01:04:14,313
Hurt too much.

702
01:04:14,285 --> 01:04:17,254
All too soon we die.

703
01:04:18,061 --> 01:04:21,497
But we do have
the chance of love.

704
01:04:25,964 --> 01:04:27,932
Do we?

705
01:04:34,859 --> 01:04:37,987
I have given
England my life.

706
01:04:38,859 --> 01:04:41,987
Must she also
have my soul?

707
01:04:42,251 --> 01:04:44,378
<i>Mary Stuart must die!</i>

708
01:04:44,458 --> 01:04:47,859
Must? Mary Stuart must die?

709
01:04:47,786 --> 01:04:51,051
Where is it written?
Who says so?
Have I ordered it?

710
01:04:50,986 --> 01:04:53,614
Majesty, this is
no time for mercy.

711
01:04:53,579 --> 01:04:55,945
Don't preach at me,
old man!

712
01:04:57,002 --> 01:04:59,766
Look at you.
You can hardly stand.

713
01:05:01,546 --> 01:05:04,572
Go home to your wife
and your bed.

714
01:05:05,768 --> 01:05:08,965
The law must
have its way.

715
01:05:11,049 --> 01:05:14,541
By whose authority
do you condemn me?

716
01:05:15,336 --> 01:05:17,395
God is my only judge.

717
01:05:18,024 --> 01:05:22,393
The law
is for common men.
Not for princes.

718
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:28,109
The law, Your Majesty,
is for the protection
of your people.

719
01:05:35,751 --> 01:05:37,582
Leave me.

720
01:05:41,831 --> 01:05:44,493
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.

721
01:05:51,334 --> 01:05:57,034
<i>You know
neither who you are
or what you do.</i>

722
01:05:58,341 --> 01:06:01,139
I know who I am.

723
01:06:01,093 --> 01:06:05,655
And if I die,
it shall be
as I have lived.

724
01:06:07,876 --> 01:06:10,401
As a queen,

725
01:06:10,373 --> 01:06:15,538
trusting in the mercy
of God, my Father.

726
01:06:54,592 --> 01:06:56,924
At which hour?

727
01:06:56,897 --> 01:06:57,921
At 8:00.

728
01:06:59,841 --> 01:07:02,002
Tomorrow morning.

729
01:08:04,699 --> 01:08:06,564
It must be stopped!

730
01:08:07,963 --> 01:08:10,022
I want it stopped!

731
01:09:04,759 --> 01:09:08,195
I forgive you
with all my heart.

732
01:11:15,981 --> 01:11:18,211
<i>Forgive me, Majesty.</i>

733
01:11:20,044 --> 01:11:22,638
I have failed you.

734
01:11:22,668 --> 01:11:25,637
How have you failed me?

735
01:11:25,932 --> 01:11:27,866
What am I
to forgive you for?

736
01:11:27,851 --> 01:11:29,819
Philip of Spain
is a God-fearing man

737
01:11:29,803 --> 01:11:32,738
who cannot declare war
without a just cause.

738
01:11:34,571 --> 01:11:38,200
I intercepted
every letter Mary Stuart
secretly dispatched,

739
01:11:39,498 --> 01:11:43,730
but failed to see that Spain
knew I was reading them.

740
01:11:45,227 --> 01:11:47,161
They waited for her
to write the words

741
01:11:47,146 --> 01:11:50,638
that would, in my eyes,
confirm her treason.

742
01:11:52,138 --> 01:11:54,402
Forgive me.

743
01:11:54,378 --> 01:11:57,176
I am trapped
in my own web.

744
01:11:59,465 --> 01:12:02,923
And I ordered
Mary's execution.

745
01:12:04,521 --> 01:12:08,514
I murdered God's
anointed Queen.

746
01:12:10,024 --> 01:12:15,792
And now God's most dutiful son
makes holy war to punish me.

747
01:12:46,853 --> 01:12:49,117
We are at war.

748
01:12:49,093 --> 01:12:52,324
Who knows when
we will meet again?

749
01:12:52,517 --> 01:12:55,008
If we will meet again.

750
01:12:56,388 --> 01:13:01,519
If England falls,
my last days will be
in a Spanish prison.

751
01:13:02,564 --> 01:13:05,158
To die far from home.

752
01:13:05,124 --> 01:13:06,785
That is the
loneliest death.

753
01:13:06,787 --> 01:13:08,448
Never.

754
01:13:10,339 --> 01:13:12,899
My thoughts
turn dark.

755
01:13:16,802 --> 01:13:18,827
What do you do
in a storm

756
01:13:18,818 --> 01:13:20,718
when you're facing
your death?

757
01:13:22,050 --> 01:13:24,541
The closer
I come to death,

758
01:13:24,547 --> 01:13:26,640
the more
I want to live,

759
01:13:26,626 --> 01:13:29,060
the hungrier
I am for life.

760
01:13:29,026 --> 01:13:33,429
Yes. To live
right to the end.

761
01:13:33,314 --> 01:13:35,908
Why be afraid
of tomorrow when today
is all we have?

762
01:13:35,873 --> 01:13:37,738
I wish...

763
01:13:39,489 --> 01:13:42,754
I have never known
a woman like you.

764
01:13:45,856 --> 01:13:49,952
In some other world,
in some other time,

765
01:13:51,904 --> 01:13:54,805
could you have
loved me?

766
01:13:55,680 --> 01:13:58,513
I know only
one world.

767
01:13:59,328 --> 01:14:03,128
And in this world,
I have loved you.

768
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:13,454
There's something
you could do for me,

769
01:14:14,846 --> 01:14:20,148
something I
have not known
for a very long time.

770
01:14:22,463 --> 01:14:25,523
If you felt
so inclined.

771
01:14:26,109 --> 01:14:30,011
But it's not to be
spoken of afterward.

772
01:14:31,102 --> 01:14:34,071
It must be forgotten.

773
01:14:35,581 --> 01:14:38,015
But just for now...

774
01:14:41,053 --> 01:14:42,748
A kiss?

775
01:15:16,281 --> 01:15:17,771
I die.

776
01:15:39,704 --> 01:15:40,728
I've given
Drake the orders

777
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:42,387
to prepare the fleet
to defend the Channel.

778
01:15:42,393 --> 01:15:43,758
How soon can you
join him?

779
01:15:43,767 --> 01:15:46,634
We're waiting for supplies.
We can move as soon
as we're ready and armed.

780
01:15:46,584 --> 01:15:47,710
Good.

781
01:15:51,543 --> 01:15:52,942
Bess.

782
01:15:53,559 --> 01:15:55,857
I have something
to tell you.

783
01:15:56,342 --> 01:15:59,573
I ask for nothing.
Is that understood?

784
01:16:01,175 --> 01:16:03,837
Your life is your own.
Nothing will change.

785
01:16:03,798 --> 01:16:05,493
What is this?

786
01:16:08,469 --> 01:16:10,699
I am...
You're with child.

787
01:16:11,382 --> 01:16:14,749
No one knows.
My plans are made.

788
01:16:14,677 --> 01:16:17,441
I shall ask the Queen
for permission
to leave court.

789
01:16:17,397 --> 01:16:18,489
Where will you go?

790
01:16:18,518 --> 01:16:20,748
To my
mother's house.

791
01:16:20,725 --> 01:16:23,387
I'm a ward of the Queen.
I can't court a man
without her permission.

792
01:16:23,348 --> 01:16:25,441
I can't marry
without her permission.

793
01:16:25,429 --> 01:16:28,262
As for having a child,

794
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:30,607
your child...

795
01:16:32,244 --> 01:16:36,146
All I know
is nothing's as it should be.

796
01:16:36,051 --> 01:16:37,780
Please, listen.

797
01:16:37,812 --> 01:16:41,009
You once said to me,
"Whatever I have to give,
ask and it's yours."

798
01:16:40,948 --> 01:16:41,937
Do you remember?

799
01:16:41,970 --> 01:16:43,460
Of course, I remember.

800
01:16:43,475 --> 01:16:45,375
I ask that you
forget me.

801
01:16:45,363 --> 01:16:48,890
Go to your ship.
Do your duty.

802
01:16:48,819 --> 01:16:51,185
Forget me.
Bess!

803
01:16:51,187 --> 01:16:53,587
We're summoned.
Coming.

804
01:17:01,649 --> 01:17:07,349
This Spanish Armada
is at sea with an army
of 10,000 men?

805
01:17:07,185 --> 01:17:09,710
And Philip's friend,
the Duke of Parma,

806
01:17:09,681 --> 01:17:13,014
has 15,000 men
on the French coast.

807
01:17:13,937 --> 01:17:17,737
They plan to cross
the Channel in barges
and sail into the Thames.

808
01:17:17,648 --> 01:17:20,276
They don't have
enough barges yet.
We have a little time.

809
01:17:20,241 --> 01:17:25,201
And our forces
defend the mouth of
the Thames at Tilbury with...

810
01:17:25,072 --> 01:17:29,099
What? How...
Four thousand men?

811
01:17:29,424 --> 01:17:32,825
Three thousand.
Possibly.

812
01:17:32,751 --> 01:17:35,151
If the Spanish fleet
unites the barges,

813
01:17:35,119 --> 01:17:37,587
their combined strength
will overwhelm us.

814
01:17:38,703 --> 01:17:41,638
Then we shall
engage them at sea,

815
01:17:41,582 --> 01:17:43,812
before they have
the chance to unite.

816
01:17:44,142 --> 01:17:45,575
Your Majesty,

817
01:17:45,582 --> 01:17:50,110
this vast Armada
will surely smash through
our naval defenses

818
01:17:49,998 --> 01:17:51,590
and overrun
us on land.

819
01:17:52,909 --> 01:17:55,878
We must prepare
for the worst.

820
01:18:34,155 --> 01:18:36,385
I need air.

821
01:18:37,514 --> 01:18:39,448
<i>With this ring,
I thee wed.</i>

822
01:18:39,434 --> 01:18:42,130
<i>With this ring,
I thee wed.</i>

823
01:18:42,090 --> 01:18:45,150
<i>With my body,
I thee worship.</i>

824
01:18:45,097 --> 01:18:48,498
<i>With my body,
I thee worship.</i>

825
01:18:48,425 --> 01:18:51,690
And with all
my worldly goods,
I thee endow.

826
01:18:51,625 --> 01:18:55,391
And with all
my worldly goods,
I thee endow.

827
01:18:55,305 --> 01:18:58,138
In the name
of the Father

828
01:18:58,089 --> 01:19:03,789
and of the Son,
and of the
Holy Ghost, amen.

829
01:19:08,328 --> 01:19:10,990
Bess!

830
01:19:13,095 --> 01:19:15,586
Bess!

831
01:19:15,559 --> 01:19:18,619
Bess Throckmorton!

832
01:19:23,271 --> 01:19:25,034
Here, my lady.

833
01:19:25,031 --> 01:19:27,465
Tell me,
is it true?

834
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:30,194
Are you with child?

835
01:19:30,917 --> 01:19:32,851
Are you with child?

836
01:19:32,998 --> 01:19:35,592
Yes, my lady.

837
01:19:35,557 --> 01:19:38,025
You traitress.

838
01:19:37,990 --> 01:19:40,424
You dare to keep
secrets from me?

839
01:19:40,389 --> 01:19:43,256
You ask my permission
before you rut!

840
01:19:43,205 --> 01:19:44,399
Before you breed!

841
01:19:44,421 --> 01:19:47,652
My bitches
wear my collars!
Do you hear me?

842
01:19:47,589 --> 01:19:48,954
Do you hear me?

843
01:19:48,964 --> 01:19:52,092
Majesty! Please,
dignity. Mercy.

844
01:19:52,036 --> 01:19:54,334
This is no time
for mercy, Walsingham.

845
01:19:54,308 --> 01:19:55,536
You go to your
traitor brother

846
01:19:55,557 --> 01:19:57,855
and leave me
to my business.

847
01:19:57,829 --> 01:19:59,820
Is it his?

848
01:19:59,811 --> 01:20:03,338
Tell me. Say it.
Is the child his?
Is it his?

849
01:20:03,268 --> 01:20:05,259
Yes.

850
01:20:05,252 --> 01:20:10,349
My lady, it is
my husband's child.

851
01:20:12,642 --> 01:20:14,166
You bitch!

852
01:20:14,179 --> 01:20:15,806
Majesty.

853
01:20:16,739 --> 01:20:20,140
This is not the Queen
I love and serve.

854
01:20:25,442 --> 01:20:28,377
This man has seduced
a ward of the Queen.

855
01:20:28,321 --> 01:20:31,950
And she has married
without royal consent.

856
01:20:31,873 --> 01:20:35,900
These offenses
are punishable by law.
Arrest him!

857
01:20:35,809 --> 01:20:37,777
Go!

858
01:20:42,208 --> 01:20:45,735
You no longer have
the Queen's protection.

859
01:20:45,665 --> 01:20:48,327
As you wish,
Majesty.

860
01:20:48,288 --> 01:20:49,653
Get out.

861
01:20:49,696 --> 01:20:52,631
Get out! Get out!

862
01:20:55,904 --> 01:20:58,896
Get out!

863
01:21:21,598 --> 01:21:25,500
The fall of an empire,
you told me.

864
01:21:25,405 --> 01:21:27,032
Did you mean
the English empire?

865
01:21:27,038 --> 01:21:30,269
Because, by God,
England will not fall
while I am Queen.

866
01:21:30,204 --> 01:21:32,672
If that is
your prophecy, sir,
you prophesy again.

867
01:21:32,637 --> 01:21:34,127
You want me to tell
Your Majesty

868
01:21:34,140 --> 01:21:35,937
only what Your Majesty
chooses to hear.

869
01:21:35,933 --> 01:21:38,231
I will not be a toy
of the fates!

870
01:21:38,204 --> 01:21:41,002
Have I not faced
an assassin's bullet
and lived?

871
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:47,676
Just tell me
there's no certainty.

872
01:21:48,795 --> 01:21:50,160
That any outcome
is possible.

873
01:21:50,171 --> 01:21:53,402
The shadow of ghosts,
you said.

874
01:21:53,499 --> 01:21:57,367
Please, just
give me hope.

875
01:21:57,274 --> 01:22:00,903
The forces that shape
our world are greater
than all of us, Majesty.

876
01:22:00,826 --> 01:22:04,455
How can I promise
that they'll conspire
in your favor,

877
01:22:04,379 --> 01:22:06,574
even though
you are the Queen?

878
01:22:09,242 --> 01:22:11,972
But this much
I know.

879
01:22:11,929 --> 01:22:17,890
When the storm breaks,
each man acts in accordance
with his own nature.

880
01:22:17,721 --> 01:22:20,246
Some are dumb
with terror.

881
01:22:20,217 --> 01:22:23,516
Some flee. Some hide.

882
01:22:23,449 --> 01:22:26,282
And some

883
01:22:26,232 --> 01:22:30,794
spread their wings
like eagles and soar
on the wind.

884
01:22:37,751 --> 01:22:41,084
You are a wise man,
Dr. Dee.

885
01:22:41,016 --> 01:22:44,213
And you, madam,
are a very great lady.

886
01:22:50,295 --> 01:22:52,855
Light the beacon!

887
01:23:42,258 --> 01:23:44,249
My lords,

888
01:23:45,202 --> 01:23:48,501
I can offer you
no words of comfort.

889
01:23:49,874 --> 01:23:53,173
This Armada
that sails against us,

890
01:23:53,106 --> 01:23:56,542
carries in its bowels
the Inquisition.

891
01:23:56,465 --> 01:23:58,990
God forbid it succeeds,

892
01:23:58,961 --> 01:24:02,419
for then there will be
no more liberty in England

893
01:24:02,354 --> 01:24:05,016
of conscience or of thought.

894
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:10,409
We cannot be defeated.

895
01:24:11,376 --> 01:24:14,106
The bells are to ring
from every tower.

896
01:24:14,065 --> 01:24:18,058
Laborers are to
leave the fields,
and take up arms.

897
01:24:17,968 --> 01:24:20,027
The harvest must wait.

898
01:24:21,296 --> 01:24:25,562
All prisoners
are to be released.

899
01:24:26,255 --> 01:24:28,655
England is their country, too.

900
01:24:44,717 --> 01:24:47,845
And release Raleigh.

901
01:24:51,118 --> 01:24:53,643
He is forgiven.

902
01:24:56,301 --> 01:24:58,633
As I, too,
long to be forgiven.

903
01:25:05,771 --> 01:25:09,332
Let the fleet know
we're on our way,
Mr. Calley!

904
01:25:10,124 --> 01:25:12,888
Fire broadside
from the bow!

905
01:25:13,963 --> 01:25:16,022
Run out the prime!

906
01:25:16,267 --> 01:25:19,634
From the starboard bow,
number one gun!

907
01:25:19,564 --> 01:25:22,158
On my mark!

908
01:25:22,123 --> 01:25:24,182
Discharge! Two!

909
01:25:24,170 --> 01:25:27,537
Three! Four!

910
01:25:51,465 --> 01:25:55,026
Majesty, the enemy
has been engaged.

911
01:25:56,328 --> 01:25:57,317
What news?

912
01:25:57,353 --> 01:26:00,584
A brave action,
Your Majesty.

913
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:02,454
Two ships lost.

914
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:04,101
With what gain?

915
01:26:04,103 --> 01:26:06,628
The enemy continue
to advance.

916
01:26:14,246 --> 01:26:17,443
Tighten the buntlines
on the foresail!

917
01:26:18,374 --> 01:26:20,535
Another four
ships lost.

918
01:26:20,583 --> 01:26:24,041
We must continue
to engage and harass
the enemy.

919
01:26:24,934 --> 01:26:28,802
We're outgunned,
Drake. Decisively.

920
01:26:29,926 --> 01:26:34,386
We're losing too many ships.
We must fall back
and defend the coast.

921
01:26:36,358 --> 01:26:37,620
If the wind
is with us, Walter,

922
01:26:37,637 --> 01:26:39,605
we can attack them
with fire ships.

923
01:26:39,590 --> 01:26:42,525
Six fire ships
into the Spanish formation,

924
01:26:42,469 --> 01:26:44,300
that may force
them to scatter.

925
01:26:44,292 --> 01:26:45,987
We can't get
anywhere near them.

926
01:26:45,988 --> 01:26:49,253
We have to break
their formation.
That's our only chance.

927
01:26:52,164 --> 01:26:54,689
The Spanish
are barely
a day away, Majesty.

928
01:26:54,659 --> 01:26:57,321
We must withdraw
to safe ground.

929
01:26:57,283 --> 01:27:02,812
I beg you to appreciate
the gravity of the situation.
There is very little time.

930
01:27:37,377 --> 01:27:40,471
My loving people.

931
01:27:42,816 --> 01:27:45,649
We see the sails
of the enemy approaching.

932
01:27:46,816 --> 01:27:50,513
We hear the Spanish guns
over the water.

933
01:27:51,999 --> 01:27:57,494
Soon now,
we will meet them
face to face.

934
01:27:59,647 --> 01:28:02,673
I am resolved in the midst
and heat of the battle

935
01:28:02,622 --> 01:28:06,285
to live or die
amongst you all!

936
01:28:10,046 --> 01:28:15,450
While we stand together,
no invader shall pass.

937
01:28:15,293 --> 01:28:19,161
Let them come
with the armies of hell!
They will not pass!

938
01:28:21,469 --> 01:28:25,030
And when this day
of battle is ended,

939
01:28:26,173 --> 01:28:28,641
we meet again in heaven

940
01:28:30,108 --> 01:28:33,771
or on the field of victory.

941
01:29:15,673 --> 01:29:18,733
Thomas! Get up!
Get up, man! Get up!

942
01:29:26,009 --> 01:29:29,308
Help me!
Somebody, help me!

943
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:31,208
Help me!

944
01:30:13,749 --> 01:30:15,444
They've dropped anchor.

945
01:30:15,444 --> 01:30:18,572
These Spanish monsters
can't handle
our English seas.

946
01:30:19,283 --> 01:30:22,446
We have the wind
in our favor.

947
01:30:22,388 --> 01:30:24,015
Do we go?

948
01:30:26,452 --> 01:30:28,420
We go.

949
01:30:28,818 --> 01:30:30,911
Godspeed, my friend.

950
01:30:32,979 --> 01:30:34,708
Walter?

951
01:30:34,707 --> 01:30:36,572
Don't forget to jump.

952
01:30:51,794 --> 01:30:53,489
Calley!

953
01:30:53,521 --> 01:30:56,149
Enough tar!
Clear the deck!

954
01:30:57,073 --> 01:30:59,871
If that cannon's primed,
set the fuse!

955
01:31:02,353 --> 01:31:06,187
Get everybody
off the ship, now!

956
01:31:10,703 --> 01:31:12,796
Get off the ship!
Off the ship!
Go!

957
01:31:12,784 --> 01:31:15,082
Get over there!

958
01:31:15,056 --> 01:31:17,650
Come on, boys!
Get going!

959
01:32:11,755 --> 01:32:13,723
The Spanish
continue to advance.

960
01:32:13,707 --> 01:32:16,141
Just five of their ships
are burning.

961
01:32:20,011 --> 01:32:22,275
Not enough.

962
01:36:36,247 --> 01:36:38,511
Amen.

963
01:37:39,507 --> 01:37:42,032
Francis?

964
01:38:00,049 --> 01:38:05,146
I have served Your Majesty
in all things.

965
01:38:06,704 --> 01:38:08,797
I know it.

966
01:38:10,991 --> 01:38:13,824
You won't need me anymore.

967
01:38:26,734 --> 01:38:28,725
You rest here,

968
01:38:32,750 --> 01:38:34,615
old friend.

969
01:39:11,851 --> 01:39:14,684
Elizabeth has a son.

970
01:39:16,555 --> 01:39:19,251
You must be proud.

971
01:39:19,210 --> 01:39:21,110
Very.

972
01:39:21,098 --> 01:39:23,658
And fulfilled.

973
01:39:23,626 --> 01:39:26,220
As any man can be.

974
01:39:27,338 --> 01:39:31,866
Do you still dream
of your shining city
in the New World?

975
01:39:32,905 --> 01:39:34,770
Always.

976
01:39:56,872 --> 01:39:59,966
I'd like to give
your son my blessing.

977
01:40:01,063 --> 01:40:03,054
I'd be honored.

978
01:41:03,171 --> 01:41:06,231
<i>I am called
the Virgin Queen.</i>

979
01:41:07,617 --> 01:41:09,812
<i>Unmarried,</i>

980
01:41:09,793 --> 01:41:12,387
<i>I have no master.</i>

981
01:41:13,410 --> 01:41:15,776
<i>Childless,</i>

982
01:41:15,778 --> 01:41:19,509
<i>I am mother to my people.</i>

983
01:41:19,969 --> 01:41:25,339
<i>God give me strength
to bear this mighty freedom.</i>

984
01:41:27,775 --> 01:41:30,608
<i>I am your Queen.</i>

985
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,798
<i>I am myself.</i>
