00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
who made the plan ?

200
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,150
Hey Anthony !

201
00:46:28,175 --> 00:46:30,175
think about it that 'What happend'?

202
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,200
you didnt know anything

203
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:37,225
what ?

204
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:42,250
money was in casioand
in casino, you kept the money

205
00:46:58,075 --> 00:47:00,075
if I say, Kirti took the money,
then what happen ?

206
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:08,100
in casino, bag belongs to you

207
00:47:08,125 --> 00:47:10,125
you hide the money

208
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:19,150
We need to trust each other

209
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:27,175
So, we will tell boss that,
we got the blank bag,
just made something wrong

210
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,200
You totally Out of mind !

211
00:48:03,225 --> 00:48:05,225
if we tell to boss
then what will he do ?

212
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:11,250
money was in bag,
everybody watched that

213
00:48:13,275 --> 00:48:15,275
We have to return 5 cr. right ?

214
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,300
To call it flop its need more two cards

215
00:48:36,325 --> 00:48:38,325
We behave like this that
We have the jackpot

280
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:21,300
He put CCTV camera everywhere

281
01:02:05,325 --> 01:02:07,325
Only 5 people know about it

282
01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:10,350

286
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:32,450
What are she talking about ?

287
01:02:39,475 --> 01:02:41,475
Everyone knows that you won the
5 Crs Jackpot

288
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,500
Everyone also knows that it was gone

i have lost 5 crs and 10 Lakhs

291
01:03:01,575 --> 01:03:03,575
But time has not yet come to unfold

292
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:07,600
Wait for the next card
you will get your turn

293
01:03:37,625 --> 01:03:39,625
In casino, maximum people lost their money

294
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:55,650
Who made the last deal of competition, Kirti ?

295
01:04:02,675 --> 01:04:04,675
Dealership is changing through table to table

296
01:04:49,700 --> 01:04:51,700
In two days, two Friends
 How you feel ?

297
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:58,725
They were not friends just familiar

298
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:02,750
Where is the Jackpot ?

299
01:05:03,775 --> 01:05:05,775
Bag was Hijacked

300
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:25,800
Is it a crime step up idle ?

301
01:05:32,850 --> 01:05:34,850
Where were you Last night ?

302
01:05:33,875 --> 01:05:35,875
He was in house

303
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:39,900
any more witness ?

304
01:05:41,925 --> 01:05:43,925
Yes ...
- Who ?

305
01:05:44,950 --> 01:05:46,950
Mother Marry & Jesus

306
01:05:57,825 --> 01:05:59,825
If that, you half goa is idle

307
01:05:59,975 --> 01:06:01,975
What is in garden ?

308
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
guess..

309
01:06:15,025 --> 01:06:18,025
who take the risk only he knows its benefits

310
01:06:38,050 --> 01:06:40,050
But why 5 crs ?

311
01:06:40,075 --> 01:06:42,075
you can put 1 cr, 5 lakh or 25 lakh

312
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:52,100
i never played a silly game

313
01:06:55,125 --> 01:06:57,125
if i leave, then ?

314
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,880
Didnt got that ?

315
01:07:55,175 --> 01:07:57,175
This game seems too dangerous

316
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:00,200
anyone can lose or win the game ...

317
01:08:01,225 --> 01:08:03,225
but casino gets its benefits

318
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:11,250
You cant go outside of Goa

319
01:08:17,275 --> 01:08:19,275
What about our deal ?

320
01:08:18,300 --> 01:08:20,300
Which deal ?

321
01:09:08,325 --> 01:09:13,325
FUCK !

322
01:09:15,350 --> 01:09:17,350
What does it means ?

323
01:09:26,375 --> 01:09:28,375
it means he leaved

324
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,400
its time to tie the tie to cats neck

325
01:10:39,425 --> 01:10:41,425
to make Disney land, we need to convince investor

326
01:11:11,450 --> 01:11:13,450
Do you have any idea about me ?

327
01:11:16,475 --> 01:11:18,475
i give the permission for all land

328
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:23,500
without my permission no one make a deal in Goa

329
01:11:28,525 --> 01:11:30,525
How was that ?

330
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:03,550
Boss is so clever

331
01:12:02,575 --> 01:12:04,575

332
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,600
