1
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:22,829
Armando,

2
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:27,844
why do you care for the calf,
when all of our money is in the herd?

3
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:34,840
Esteban, one day my father's ranch
will be passed on to my brother and I.

4
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:39,754
We will want this calf and many more like it.

5
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:44,960
I still say you care more
for the baby cow than for a woman.

6
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:49,265
Yes, it's true, Manuel,

7
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:52,895
but only because
I have not found the right woman.

8
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:32,033
I propose a contest.

9
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:34,908
Let's race back to the house!

10
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:41,480
I hope nothing bad happens
on the way home!

11
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:45,383
I'm riding a horse!

12
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,394
Get down.

13
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,445
This is not good.

14
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,273
He's a drug dealer!

15
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:14,009
We should ride down and help this man.

16
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:15,780
And get killed?

17
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,616
Maybe he just wants to talk to him.

18
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,628
Holy mother.

19
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,901
Praying will not help that man.

20
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:37,334
Perhaps praying is all we can do.

21
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:48,012
What are we doing here?

22
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,418
Your brother may already be home!

23
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:55,452
Fuck, yeah!

24
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:57,017
Quiet.

25
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:10,533
Come in.

26
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,536
Father, is this a good time?

27
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,114
What do you want?

28
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:20,150
Pardon, nothing, sir. I was just...

29
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:22,049
Where have you been?

30
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:26,213
We were taking the cattle
to a new pasture as you asked.

31
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,284
What took you so long? There is much work
to do around here, Armando!

32
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:31,953
Is there something wrong, Father?

33
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,491
Leave me alone.

34
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:38,530
Armando.

35
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:40,034
Yes, Father?

36
00:07:40,726 --> 00:07:41,727
Come over here.

37
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:47,940
Armando, forgive me.

38
00:07:49,735 --> 00:07:52,511
I have many worries.

39
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:56,076
Please let me help, Father.

40
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,750
You are so much like your mother.

41
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:03,489
She had such a good heart.

42
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,154
And I know your heart is in the right place,

43
00:08:06,219 --> 00:08:09,393
but like your mother, you are not smart.

44
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:11,833
You have never been smart.

45
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:13,029
But I am smart, Father.

46
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:15,698
Yes, of course, Armando.

47
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:20,335
For my trouble,
I need someone who is very smart.

48
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,879
If you were truly smart,

49
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,507
you would know that you are dumb.

50
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,944
Look at your fat head.

51
00:08:28,941 --> 00:08:30,147
Raul!

52
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,311
Raul, your brother.

53
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,249
It's Raul.

54
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:39,859
You arrange everything with the Japanese
and then give them the merchandise.

55
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,692
- Raul!
- Brother!

56
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,902
We are close brothers.

57
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:50,998
We have shared so much, man.

58
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:53,133
Raul!

59
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,269
Papa!

60
00:08:56,836 --> 00:09:00,807
Finally, the one with brains has returned!

61
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:05,520
You're the son I've always loved!

62
00:09:12,852 --> 00:09:15,059
Fuck, I almost forgot.

63
00:09:16,155 --> 00:09:17,600
Sweetheart.

64
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:23,397
May I introduce to you Miss Sonia Lopez?

65
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:43,122
Sonia Lopez.

66
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:45,628
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

67
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:46,686
It's nice to meet you.

68
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,130
Let me look at you.

69
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:51,168
You look amazing.

70
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:53,867
You must be Armando.

71
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:57,135
Armando Alvarez, Miss Lopez.

72
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:59,231
Welcome to our house.

73
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,904
Thank you, but please call me Sonia.

74
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:04,915
And I can call you Armando?

75
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,349
I would like that, Sonia.

76
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:11,216
Esteban de los Santos Escobar Chavez.

77
00:10:20,586 --> 00:10:21,724
Sir.

78
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,791
Thank you, Esmeralda.

79
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:26,200
You're welcome.

80
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,532
Sir.

81
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,771
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

82
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,368
Thank you, sweetheart.

83
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:39,678
Raul, you have brought so much happiness
to our father.

84
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:41,685
I am an Alvarez, no?

85
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:46,879
If only we could keep the drug dealers
off the ranch.

86
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:50,449
Just this morning,
I was out with Manuel and Esteban,

87
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:52,689
and we came across a killing.

88
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:55,130
Why was I not told?

89
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:58,331
I saw that you had many worries.

90
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,468
They killed a man.

91
00:11:01,527 --> 00:11:03,700
I believe it was by the Onza.

92
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,100
The Onza?

93
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,743
Miss Lopez. Sonia.

94
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,075
How nice to see you.

95
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,276
It's a pleasure that you're here,

96
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,977
because here...

97
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:20,047
Armando has never done anything
with a woman.

98
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,922
It seems like he's not interested in women.

99
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,619
Is this true, Armando?

100
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,721
Do you have no interest in women?

101
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:30,233
I would not say that, Miss Lopez.

102
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:33,600
I just have not found the woman for me.

103
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,434
What would this woman be like?

104
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:45,573
My woman, Miss Lopez,

105
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:50,351
must love the land as I do.

106
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:55,086
More than all the gold in the world,

107
00:11:55,147 --> 00:12:00,119
she must find pleasure
in the scent of the cactus flower.

108
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,933
She would sleep beneath the stars

109
00:12:04,957 --> 00:12:10,737
and let the wild west wind caress her body

110
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:13,276
and blanket her soul.

111
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:18,244
Her passions would be my passions,

112
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,681
her dreams, my dreams.

113
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:25,889
And our love would be a great song,

114
00:12:26,011 --> 00:12:28,787
and the song would be true.

115
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,461
Armando is
a ridiculously hopeless romantic!

116
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:46,599
What woman would sleep
in the dirt with him, please?

117
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,174
Sonia.

118
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:49,910
Come over here.

119
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:57,149
Sonia.

120
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:03,724
Father, I...

121
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:10,029
Excuse me. Miss Lopez, Sonia and I,

122
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:14,730
would like to ask your permission
to be married.

123
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,167
To get married?

124
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:20,676
You two? What a delight!

125
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:27,842
The Lord has blessed the Alvarez house.

126
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:30,075
Thank you!

127
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:34,047
For Raul and for Sonia.

128
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:35,558
Much happiness.

129
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:36,786
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

130
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:39,089
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

131
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:40,687
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

132
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,461
- For you, brother, cheers
- Cheers.

133
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:00,842
So it's true?

134
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,710
It says here that Raul is getting married
to this woman.

135
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,051
It's true.

136
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:11,586
She is the most beautiful woman
I have ever seen.

137
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,960
She is very pretty.

138
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:18,967
You don't sound happy, Armando.

139
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:22,397
Are you jealous of your brother?

140
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:24,099
Jealous?

141
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:28,669
No, Manuel, I could never be jealous of Raul.

142
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:35,416
Maybe I love him too much,
and I am concerned.

143
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:36,851
Concerned?

144
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:39,084
I don't know.

145
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:41,522
He has changed.

146
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,459
I think you are jealous.

147
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:46,359
I am jealous.

148
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:49,830
If I had a woman like this...

149
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:52,267
I would never get out of bed.

150
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:13,780
Can I not share in your joke?

151
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:19,124
I'm afraid not, Miss Lopez.

152
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,288
The joke was about you.

153
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,332
Do you ride?

154
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,460
I haven't in a long time,

155
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:27,900
but I would like to.

156
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,407
Esteban, please check on the herd.

157
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:34,410
- I shall meet you there later.
- Of course.

158
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,337
You ride well, Miss Lopez.

159
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,943
Good control, nice poise.

160
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:17,146
That is a difficult horse.

161
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:18,788
You have ridden before.

162
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:22,424
From the time I could walk,
my father put me on the back of a horse.

163
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,256
I see.

164
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:28,431
When I was nine,
my father was murdered in his bed.

165
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,933
They took me to the city
to live with my uncle.

166
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,196
Interesting.

167
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:34,362
My uncle was very mean.

168
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:39,569
He drank rubbing alcohol, and he hit me
and burned me with his cigarettes.

169
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:40,837
Interesting.

170
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:44,471
I ran away from him when I was 12.

171
00:16:46,238 --> 00:16:49,879
But he found me, and beat me, and said
he would marry me when I was grown up.

172
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:51,319
Interesting.

173
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:54,452
And your uncle?

174
00:16:55,647 --> 00:16:58,457
I have not seen him in a long time.

175
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,555
I have to ask you something.

176
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:03,360
Do you love Raul?

177
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:10,171
<i>Raul has been very good to me,</i>
<i>and I have been good to him.</i>

178
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,401
Do you love him?

179
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:14,978
I must know.

180
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:22,041
A race. I will show you how well I ride!
Giddy up!

181
00:17:23,275 --> 00:17:25,118
Not if I can help it!

182
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,547
This is beautiful.

183
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,184
What is this place?

184
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:00,755
It is called

185
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:04,386
The Pond of the Seven Tears.

186
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:10,125
I swam here as a boy.

187
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:16,204
It is the most beautiful spot
I have seen in all my life.

188
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:19,740
How did you know to ride here?

189
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:22,942
The wind told me.

190
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:26,115
Sometimes the wind talks to me.

191
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:31,979
This is the place my mother was killed.

192
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:34,714
This was her favorite place.

193
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,431
I have much work to do.

194
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,867
Go then. I am only drying my hair.

195
00:18:45,924 --> 00:18:47,631
Okay, but do not be long.

196
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,604
There are bandits in these hills.

197
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:52,039
Armando will protect me.

198
00:18:52,097 --> 00:18:53,440
Yes.

199
00:18:56,869 --> 00:18:58,348
My son,

200
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:00,576
this was my father's rifle.

201
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:04,152
He passed it on to me when I was a boy,

202
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:06,780
and today I am giving it to you.

203
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:12,322
Go. You must build our ranch.

204
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,266
Armando.

205
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:26,303
What do you want?

206
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:27,867
Armando, give me the gun.

207
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:30,140
Boy, give me the gun!

208
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,675
No! Let me go! No!

209
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:38,383
Go! Don't touch me!

210
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:56,698
She loved coming here.

211
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,274
I am sorry.

212
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:02,278
It was a long time ago.

213
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:06,111
I could stay here forever.

214
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,849
I doubt that very much.

215
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:12,253
Why is that?

216
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,816
There is nothing to buy.

217
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,418
No shops,

218
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:20,394
no expensive clothes,

219
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:22,363
no fancy shoes.

220
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:26,428
This is not Dallas.

221
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:28,334
Is that what you think of me?

222
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:31,203
Someone who needs fancy shoes?

223
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:35,301
It does not matter what I think of you.

224
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:40,172
You think I'm some kind of cheap woman
who is only interested in Raul's money?

225
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,741
Are you?

226
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:50,290
You never answered my question.

227
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,290
What question?

228
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,888
Do you love my brother?

229
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:56,557
Take me back, now!

230
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,659
Answer the question!

231
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:00,894
Bongos!

232
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:02,063
- Congas?
- Guns.

233
00:21:02,127 --> 00:21:03,401
Where?

234
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:04,839
Over that hill.

235
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:05,897
Hunters?

236
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:07,739
Those are not hunters.

237
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,038
Perhaps someone is hurt.

238
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,979
It is not our concern.

239
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:15,710
You are a coward. A coward!

240
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:18,577
Sonia!

241
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,752
No!

242
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:37,238
Sir? Sir?

243
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,842
Please... God forgive me.

244
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,512
Easy. We'll take you to the hospital.

245
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,379
Let him die.

246
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,612
He is missing a hand.

247
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,613
Give me your water, Armando.

248
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:54,150
Waste water on that?

249
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:57,720
In the trunk. It's in the trunk.

250
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,029
Take it...

251
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:05,766
Here, take this.

252
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:13,009
I know you.

253
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,635
You are Sonia.

254
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,373
I found some drugs!

255
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:19,780
Armando, please help me put him
on the horse.

256
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:23,319
He is coming.

257
00:22:23,408 --> 00:22:24,716
The Onza.

258
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:31,122
Maybe God will be merciful.

259
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,123
He is dead!

260
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:40,497
He was dead a long time ago.

261
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:45,202
It looks like these belong to you now.

262
00:22:45,263 --> 00:22:47,504
You are a rich woman.

263
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,911
Don't you want them?

264
00:22:53,972 --> 00:23:00,389
Perhaps as a wedding present
from an old dying friend?

265
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:05,826
You have answered my question.

266
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,328
You do not love my brother.

267
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:16,005
Let me go. You're hurting me.

268
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,701
I don't think you hurt so easily.

269
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:22,644
I know the kind of woman you are.

270
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:25,204
You know nothing about me.

271
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:29,582
I know that you will not marry Raul
if I can help it.

272
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:34,919
Do you think Raul is so innocent?

273
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:36,990
You lie!

274
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:41,965
You stupid rancher.

275
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:45,001
Your brother is a drug dealer!

276
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:48,936
You have done this!

277
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:52,806
So help me God, if it is true,

278
00:23:52,864 --> 00:23:55,435
and my brother is involved in drugs,

279
00:23:55,534 --> 00:24:00,608
you shall never have the name Alvarez!

280
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:04,351
I'll take care of my family.

281
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:07,947
Let the devil take care of you.

282
00:24:22,093 --> 00:24:27,338
Are you so sure
that Raul is involved with drugs?

283
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:29,470
I don't know, Manuel.

284
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:33,710
I have sensed something since his return,

285
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:36,810
and this morning with Sonia...

286
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:40,448
Perhaps she is lying. Bitches are liars.

287
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:44,050
It is true. Bitches are liars.

288
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:46,721
But Miss Lopez is no bitch.

289
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:50,925
I like bitches.

290
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:15,047
You two wait here
while I go and talk to Raul.

291
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:33,902
It is true, Raul?

292
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:36,742
What are you speaking of, Armando?

293
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,815
You are in the drug business.

294
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:43,150
I am in business in Mexico, Armando.

295
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,949
What's the difference?

296
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:50,082
Raul, you have brought shame to our family.

297
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:54,153
No, Armando. I am here to save this family.

298
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,220
There's a difference.

299
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:58,131
You are taking this family to hell!

300
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:06,768
Armando, Little Armando, listen.

301
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:10,035
Yes.

302
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:11,773
Sol move drugs over the border.

303
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:13,975
So why do you care?

304
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,110
I do not sell drugs to my people.

305
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,380
I sell it to the Americans.

306
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:20,753
I don't sell drugs to our people. No, no, no.

307
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:24,021
I sell the Americans drugs, but I'd sell them
chocolates if they wanted them.

308
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:25,685
But they don't!

309
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:30,863
This is not the America
our father held in such high esteem.

310
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:34,033
This is a country of babies.

311
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:36,995
They buy houses with no money.

312
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:39,770
TVs and cars with no money.

313
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:45,004
They stuff their faces like monsters

314
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:50,051
with shit burgers and grease.

315
00:26:50,542 --> 00:26:54,149
It's irresponsible to feed candy to babies.

316
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:56,818
No, they are not babies, Armando.

317
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:59,919
They are all adults, and they are crazy.

318
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:03,922
They only cry like babies.

319
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:07,196
The damn Mexicans are coming!

320
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:10,171
They are going to fuck us up
and kill us with their drugs!

321
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:11,639
Fuck them!

322
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:16,207
Fuck their drug-addicted children!

323
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,046
Fuck them all.

324
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:22,449
Fuck their heroin-addicted wives
who stuff themselves non-stop with pasta.

325
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:26,249
Fuck their pot smoking doctors
from California.

326
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,654
Fuck them!

327
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:31,491
If they can't stop themselves
from shoving bags of shit up their nose,

328
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:33,586
then let's make a buck while we can,
Little Armando.

329
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:36,297
Yes, yes. If it was so simple.

330
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:40,234
But instead we have been infected
with greed.

331
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:42,737
We will all kill each other

332
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:48,039
feeding the shit-eating
crazy monster babies.

333
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:53,577
Look, Armando, this country will be strong

334
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:56,414
from America's weakness.

335
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:59,047
Sons of bitches.

336
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,258
What's up?

337
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,327
You are Raul?

338
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,672
You know very well who I am.

339
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:20,634
And I know very well who you are.

340
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,308
Onza.

341
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,273
Onza.

342
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:28,883
The Onza.

343
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:36,418
So, Raul, what the hell are you doing here?

344
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:41,223
I am here visiting my family.

345
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:44,562
I am here because...

346
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,740
This is my land.

347
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:01,076
You motherfucker,
you think you're a big boy?

348
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:02,948
He's really funny. Isn't he, Armando?

349
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:04,987
Look, Raul.

350
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,787
I don't believe you.

351
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:14,558
You have already taken my woman,

352
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:17,395
and I think you are here for something more.

353
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:20,098
The woman was never yours.

354
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:22,160
- Oh, no?
- No.

355
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,331
And I repeat.

356
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:26,074
I am here...

357
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:29,101
...because...

358
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:34,342
...this is my land.

359
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:43,459
Armando.

360
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:45,324
Yes?

361
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:48,193
Can I call you Little Armando?

362
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,321
I'd like that.

363
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,596
Do you know what your brother is doing?

364
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:58,071
Do you know what business he is in?

365
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:05,678
It's very dangerous for you

366
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:07,910
and very dangerous for him.

367
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:13,049
And it's very dangerous for your family.

368
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,188
Easy, ea$Y

369
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:22,595
Not all dirty, little ranchers
like Canadian Slims.

370
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:24,394
Yes, I like them.

371
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:28,798
All right then,

372
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,464
I only came to bring you this.

373
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:32,701
I think it belongs to you.

374
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:35,210
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

375
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:39,511
Raul.

376
00:30:40,972 --> 00:30:43,282
This is going to get very ugly.

377
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:45,350
That's okay.

378
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,350
Goodbye.

379
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:48,947
See you around.

380
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:51,183
See you later.

381
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:53,187
Bye.

382
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:57,960
'BYE bye.
- Bye.

383
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:29,063
It does not seem
as if this Onza wants to follow your plan.

384
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:36,566
Armando, go home.

385
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:42,738
Mexico is no place for cowards.

386
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:53,285
<i>I five my fife on earth</i>

387
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:57,188

00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:59,411
<i>How can I know anything?</i>

405
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,889
<i>What is there to know?</i>

406
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:04,483

423
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:24,330
<i>Is love</i>

424
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:58,200
Look at that.

425
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:04,837
Holy Mary, a white cat.

426
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:07,079
This is a rare thing.

427
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,986
Let me kill it.

428
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:14,789
You cannot kill this.

429
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,859
He is here for a reason.

430
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:21,556
Yes, so that I can shoot him.

431
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:24,190
I do not know the reason,

432
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:27,429
but I believe it has something to do with me.

433
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:48,854
Look at this country.

434
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:52,361
Always such beauty.

435
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:56,190
Why is there so much pain?

436
00:35:57,588 --> 00:36:00,364
Esteban slept on a rock last night.

437
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:04,764
I slept on a bottle of tequila.

438
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:11,974
What is this?

439
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:13,037
I do not know.

440
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:20,885
I don't like this.

441
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:21,946
FEDERAL POLICE

442
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,856
You two stay here.

443
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:27,456
Be careful.

444
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:39,340
Armando Alvarez?

445
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:42,205
Yes. That is my name.

446
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:44,340
I am Vincent Blancardo.

447
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:48,276
I was friend of your father's in the old days.

448
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,042
You were the one who found my mother.

449
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:53,815
Yes, many years ago.

450
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:58,388
Armando, these men are from America.

451
00:36:58,449 --> 00:37:00,451
They are with the DEA.

452
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:03,122
Yes, how can I help you?

453
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,303
No, sir.

454
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,402
I don't speak American.

455
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:23,608
Armando, I need you to help me.

456
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:24,812
Of course.

457
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:29,857
We know that your brother is a drug dealer.

458
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:36,922
We also know that he is here
to take over the territory of the Onza.

459
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:43,197
I don't think I can help you, Mr...

460
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,672
Parker.

461
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,639
The name is Parker.

462
00:37:47,632 --> 00:37:51,341
I think you can help me.

463
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,821
Listen, you piece of shit.

464
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:06,828
I make one call,

465
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:08,989
and I can get 10 helicopters

466
00:38:09,086 --> 00:38:11,862
to come up over that hill

467
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:14,061
and turn your ranch

468
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,866
into a lit fart.

469
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:19,033
So you think about that.

470
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,950
It is better this way, Armando.

471
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:37,321
Talk to Raul.

472
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:40,328
Find out for this man.

473
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,159
Now go find out.

474
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,560
Ladies and gentlemen,

475
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:25,698
I want to thank you all for coming today.

476
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:29,871
Tomorrow will be a great day
for the Alvarez family.

477
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:33,507
It's a pleasure to share it with all of you.

478
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:38,050
My sister, Carmen,
has come from Guadalajara.

479
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:41,880
My other sister, Margarite,
has come from Puerto Vallarta.

480
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,057
My cousin, Hernan, and his wife, Doleta.

481
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:47,255
My friends for life.

482
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:52,194
Of course, Sheila from Atlanta!

483
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:01,639
Tomorrow will be a double celebration.

484
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:06,546
The return of my son, Raul, to his land.

485
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:10,074
Also, he brought home this precious woman

486
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:12,951
with whom he gets to have sex.

487
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,421
I propose a toast to Sonia.

488
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:16,151
For Sonia! Friends.

489
00:40:16,647 --> 00:40:18,524
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

490
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:19,583
For Sonia.

491
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:20,924
Cheers!

492
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:24,865
I'd also like to propose a toast

493
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:27,926
and thank those who have come from so far.

494
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:32,803
But I would like to specially thank someone,

495
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:36,310
someone who many of you have often
called stupid, imbecile, fat head,

496
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:40,144
but he's a guy with a big heart.

497
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:42,309
I propose a toast

498
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:44,353
for my brother.

499
00:40:44,408 --> 00:40:46,388
For your happiness, Armando.

500
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:55,890
Well, Armando?

501
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:59,924
You aren't going to toast
to your brother's happiness?

502
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:04,967
Yes.

503
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:09,775
To Raul's happiness.

504
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:13,213
May you enjoy all of life's pleasure.

505
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:17,283
Even if it means the destruction
of this family!

506
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:18,676
Stop, Armando!

507
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,691
Please!

508
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:29,059
It hurts me to say it,

509
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,659
but tomorrow I do not wish
for you to be at your brother's wedding.

510
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:36,000
Do you understand me? Get out!

511
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:40,235
As you wish.

512
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:41,640
- Armando...
- Let him go!

513
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:47,805
Armando!

514
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:49,783
Let me talk to him.
You stay with your guests.

515
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:57,187
Armando.

516
00:41:57,281 --> 00:41:59,192
Go back inside, Sonia.

517
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:00,694
Go back to your people.

518
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:03,391
Don't make trouble, Armando.

519
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:06,628
Do you think I like
that Raul is mixed up in this business?

520
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,102
It is your business too.

521
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:10,661
We can change him.

522
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:12,730
But I need your help.

523
00:42:12,796 --> 00:42:14,332
Armando,

524
00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:17,311
there's something you need to know.

525
00:42:18,769 --> 00:42:21,978
What is it that I must know?

526
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:25,919
This drug dealer they call the Onza.

527
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:30,083
He is my uncle.

528
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:31,626
I understand.

529
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:36,621
He will never stop until
he has what he wants.

530
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:40,362
You come from trouble,
and you carry it with you.

531
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:43,964
Then save us.

532
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,029
Save your brother.

533
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:46,472
Save your family.

534
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:49,568
Save me.

535
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:55,010
Some things are beyond saving.

536
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,913

Father.

549
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:46,881
Raul, who did this? Was it Armando?

550
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:48,048
Easy, Dad, don't talk.

551
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,189
Don't die on me.

552
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:58,027
Armando was right.

553
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,627
He was dead the day we came to his house.

554
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:05,970
Hold on, Papa...
Hold on, you're gonna be fine.

555
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:08,509
It has his fingerprints all over it!

556
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:09,634
What?

557
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,441
It had to be Armando!

558
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:13,482
How the hell could it be Armando, Papa?

559
00:46:47,271 --> 00:46:48,716
Hello, Blancardo...

560
00:46:48,772 --> 00:46:50,547
The deed is done.

561
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:53,487
<i>Sonia?</i>

562
00:46:53,577 --> 00:46:56,524
She is alive, just as you wanted.

563
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:57,923
Good.

564
00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:59,187
Raul?

565
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:03,129
Raul still lives.

566
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:05,167
So let me get this right...

567
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:09,795
I'm paying the police to protect me.

568
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:13,034
Do the police not honor
their obligations anymore?

569
00:47:13,096 --> 00:47:14,473
<i>Don't worry.</i>

570
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:18,535
He will come to you now.

571
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:22,149
We must figure out how to bring him back.

572
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:25,645
The woman.

573
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:28,313
His woman.

574
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:30,324
Sonia.

575
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:32,085
Little Sonia.

576
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:35,229
My little niece.

577
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:36,628
Fine. Thank you.

578
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:52,840
Whoa, stop! Hey, Armando!

579
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:54,712
Esteban, my friend.
Why are you in such a hurry?

580
00:47:54,771 --> 00:47:56,011
They shot your father!

581
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:57,074
What?

582
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:59,120
The wedding! Gunmen shooting!

583
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,210
Raul?

584
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:01,449
Raul and the woman are safe.

585
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:05,391
Your father, Armando.
Your father is dying.

586
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:06,587
Let's go!

587
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:08,091
Fast!

588
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:26,213
Armando, come.

589
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:27,913
Yes, Father?

590
00:48:27,971 --> 00:48:29,712
It is me.

591
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:34,080
Do you remember your mother?

592
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:35,656
Yes.

593
00:48:35,712 --> 00:48:37,521
I remember her a little.

594
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:41,095
She was a very beautiful woman.

595
00:48:41,184 --> 00:48:44,757
She was a beautiful woman.

596
00:48:44,821 --> 00:48:48,200
The most beautiful in all of Mexico.

597
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:51,762
You know, you have her eyes.

598
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:55,275
You have told me that many times.

599
00:48:55,365 --> 00:48:59,836
The eyes of a small chicken.

600
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,849
Little chicken...

601
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:06,550
I have been very mean to you.

602
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:10,390
Calling you stupid all the time,

603
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:15,021
comparing you to donkeys and pigs,

604
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:18,996
laughing at the way you speak.

605
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:25,336
Giving you to the circus.

606
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:32,642
Perhaps I have never forgiven you

607
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:36,045
for the accident.

608
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:39,283
For this, I am very sorry.

609
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:42,450
I was hoping,

610
00:49:42,512 --> 00:49:47,222
when I see your mother in heaven,

611
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:50,956
I could tell her that her home,

612
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:56,061
and her family are well.

613
00:49:57,394 --> 00:50:00,932
What will I say now, Armando?

614
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:07,440
You must tell her a lie.

615
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:13,617
Tell her Raul has married
a beautiful woman,

616
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:17,648
and that she will have children

617
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:22,527
and the Alvarez family is known

618
00:50:22,586 --> 00:50:27,934
throughout Mexico as an honorable family.

619
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:34,334
I will tell her a lie.

620
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:42,712
Because I am ashamed
of the truth, Armando.

621
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:51,488
I am ashamed.

622
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:01,328
Father...

623
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:05,864
Father...

624
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:15,674
I will kill the motherfucker
responsible for it.

625
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:18,953
He was not killed by any man.

626
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:22,513
He died of shame.

627
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:25,055
It's Sonia.

628
00:51:25,148 --> 00:51:27,128
She has taken one of the horses.

629
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:33,128
Find Esteban and look for her, Armando.

630
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:34,225
Please.

631
00:51:35,292 --> 00:51:38,569
I can help you look for your woman.

632
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:42,838
But after she has been found,
dead or alive,

633
00:51:42,899 --> 00:51:45,209
that is the last you will see of me.

634
00:53:10,587 --> 00:53:16,594
Do you think the water will
wash off your shame?

635
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:20,330
Leave me alone, Armando.

636
00:53:20,397 --> 00:53:24,140
I forbid you to swim in this place.

637
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:27,444
It is sacred to me.

638
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:30,576
Swim?

639
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:31,812
No.

640
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:35,646
I cannot swim.

641
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:38,591
No one ever taught me how to swim.

642
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,799
Sonia...

643
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:10,590
Sonia!

644
00:54:18,955 --> 00:54:22,232
Please, Armando, I don't want to live.

645
00:54:22,392 --> 00:54:24,429
You would kill yourself?

646
00:54:24,527 --> 00:54:28,475
You are a fool!

647
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:30,169
I cannot live.

648
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:33,578
Don't you know there is no escape for me?

649
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:40,521
You knew what you were getting into
when you came with Raul.

650
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:44,949
Yes. Yes, I knew.

651
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:47,256
He talked of living on this ranch,

652
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:52,528
and said everything would be different.

653
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:54,466
And you believed him?

654
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:55,831
Yes.

655
00:54:55,892 --> 00:54:56,893
No.

656
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,271
I don't know...

657
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:03,675
Please, Armando...

658
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:07,814
Leave me alone.
Raul does not need me.

659
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:12,115
I have not come for Raul.

660
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:14,582
I have come for you.

661
00:55:14,744 --> 00:55:16,417
Armando...

662
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:19,949
I am no good!

663
00:55:20,016 --> 00:55:23,691
I am no better!

664
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:17,876
Look at them.

665
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:21,541
So peaceful.

666
00:57:27,377 --> 00:57:32,292
I thought you said this was Raul's woman?

667
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:34,362
She does not look like Raul's woman to me.

668
00:57:34,417 --> 00:57:36,419
This is Raul's woman.

669
00:57:36,486 --> 00:57:39,956
Sonia, why are you sleeping
with this dirty rancher?

670
00:57:40,056 --> 00:57:41,535
Please, Uncle...

671
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:43,969
Well, whatever makes you happy.

672
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:46,973
Maybe Raul has no dick.

673
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:52,073
Lately I've been enjoying
all these dick jokes.

674
00:57:53,636 --> 00:57:55,638
What is it that you want?

675
00:57:55,705 --> 00:57:58,914
This is the land of my father.

676
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:01,046
You are trespassing.

677
00:58:01,110 --> 00:58:03,420
No, we aren't trespassing.

678
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:09,522
It is you who is trespassing
on your brother's woman.

679
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:11,960
<i>That's a good one too!</i>

680
00:58:12,021 --> 00:58:15,025
Leave us alone.

681
00:58:15,758 --> 00:58:18,432
No.

682
00:58:18,628 --> 00:58:19,902
Take her.

683
00:58:19,963 --> 00:58:23,103
We will see if Raul wants her back.

684
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:27,405
Stay away!

685
00:58:27,604 --> 00:58:29,982
Or I'll beat you with these hands!

686
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:34,121
No, no, no. I didn't come to fight.

687
00:58:34,244 --> 00:58:36,451
Kill him.

688
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:41,720
It is fitting that you should die
where your mother died.

689
00:58:41,784 --> 00:58:44,264
If you had only let me rape her,

690
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:46,698
she would not have died that day.

691
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:51,261
You.

692
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:53,773
Kiss your mother for me, Armando.

693
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:00,913
You coward!

694
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:02,677
Hold on, the gun is still hot.

695
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:04,446
Shut up!

696
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:09,656
No.

697
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:12,886
Let the coyotes take him.

698
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:17,895
We must save our bullets for the brother.

699
00:59:29,332 --> 00:59:31,744
Let's go.

700
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:42,985
Do not underestimate Raul.

701
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:50,659
Raul was foolish to come into my territory.

702
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:54,793
He will lose everything,

703
00:59:54,857 --> 00:59:57,497
including you.

704
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:55,912
I am Yik'in Chan Kwawiil.

705
01:01:55,978 --> 01:01:58,356
The one that darkens the sky.

706
01:01:58,414 --> 01:02:01,122
The Jaguar King of the mountain.

707
01:02:01,184 --> 01:02:04,188
You know me as the Onza.

708
01:02:04,253 --> 01:02:07,234
Your journey has only now just begun.

709
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:10,362
It is the time for your vision!

710
01:02:20,470 --> 01:02:23,940
<i>Mexico is no place for cowards.</i>

711
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:25,644
<i>Save your brother.</i>

712
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:26,982
<i>Save your family.</i>

713
01:02:27,043 --> 01:02:28,716
<i>Save me.</i>

714
01:02:41,157 --> 01:02:43,694
<i>Kiss your mother for me.</i>

715
01:03:01,644 --> 01:03:04,716
I have hidden inside the mountains,

716
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:09,287
and you have hidden inside yourself.

717
01:03:09,352 --> 01:03:12,925
The hiding place is irrelevant

718
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:18,063
when the hidden hide for no reason.

719
01:03:39,549 --> 01:03:42,689
I will not be struck!

720
01:03:42,752 --> 01:03:47,326
By man or beast!

721
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:49,529
I am Armando Alvarez!

722
01:03:49,592 --> 01:03:50,798
Again!

723
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:53,602
I am Armando Alvarez!

724
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:55,006
One more time.

725
01:03:55,064 --> 01:03:58,238
I am Armando Alvarez!

726
01:03:58,301 --> 01:04:00,542
Good.

727
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:03,307
I am

728
01:04:03,372 --> 01:04:05,909
Armando Alvarez.

729
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:18,688
He has Sonia.

730
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:22,366
Good. I knew you would go with me.

731
01:04:22,425 --> 01:04:23,597
No, Raul.

732
01:04:23,659 --> 01:04:25,161
I'll go alone for her.

733
01:04:25,962 --> 01:04:28,135
Little Armando...

734
01:04:30,233 --> 01:04:32,235
Don't be a fool.

735
01:04:34,136 --> 01:04:37,242
I have been a fool for too long.

736
01:04:49,252 --> 01:04:51,163
Hello, this is the Onza.
How can I help you?

737
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:52,995
He has assembled a small army.

738
01:04:53,589 --> 01:04:55,125
Let him come.

739
01:04:55,191 --> 01:04:57,068
I am ready for him.

740
01:04:57,126 --> 01:05:00,505
Just keep the Americans away.

741
01:05:00,596 --> 01:05:03,236
They want nothing to do with this.

742
01:05:03,299 --> 01:05:05,108
They want you to kill each other.

743
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:07,408
Good.

744
01:05:07,470 --> 01:05:09,177
After I kill Raul,

745
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:12,219
I will kill those fucking Americans.

746
01:05:12,275 --> 01:05:13,413
Okay?

747
01:05:13,476 --> 01:05:14,477
All right.

748
01:05:14,543 --> 01:05:16,284
Bye.

749
01:05:20,483 --> 01:05:22,861
This Onza is such a fucking coward!

750
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:26,059
Does he think he can come
into my house uninvited?

751
01:05:26,122 --> 01:05:28,534
Does he think he can take any woman?

752
01:05:28,591 --> 01:05:30,195
No!

753
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:34,469
I'm not going to let him kill
any more of my own flesh and blood!

754
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:38,374
This is the end of that fucking Onza!

755
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:39,742
You know what?

756
01:05:39,802 --> 01:05:42,612
We won't allow him to fuck it up again!

757
01:05:43,472 --> 01:05:47,010
This fucking Onza is done!

758
01:05:56,886 --> 01:06:03,861
You will see that your uncle can provide you
with all that Raul promised,

759
01:06:03,926 --> 01:06:08,068
and much more.

760
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,474
You're so beautiful.

761
01:06:10,533 --> 01:06:12,774
Thank you.

762
01:06:15,037 --> 01:06:16,710
Bitch!

763
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:21,854
No one is coming for you.

764
01:06:21,911 --> 01:06:23,219
He will come.

765
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:24,758
And he will kill you.

766
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:27,795
Raul?

767
01:06:27,883 --> 01:06:29,988
I do not speak of Raul.

768
01:06:33,689 --> 01:06:36,431
Are you referring to that filthy rancher?

769
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:37,562
Yes.

770
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:41,172
Little niece, you are a fool.

771
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:43,232
I told you a million times, I killed him.

772
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:45,404
He is dead.

773
01:06:45,468 --> 01:06:49,917
The wind tells me he is not.

774
01:08:46,355 --> 01:08:48,335
I'm jumping!

775
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:57,638
The one they call the Onza.

776
01:08:57,700 --> 01:09:00,044
My name is Armando Alvarez.

777
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:03,777
I am talking to you, Onza!

778
01:09:03,873 --> 01:09:05,546
I'm surprised to see you alive.

779
01:09:05,608 --> 01:09:08,054
I want the girl.

780
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:10,647
Let her go and the two of us will leave.

781
01:09:13,716 --> 01:09:15,718
I can kill you now with one shot.

782
01:09:15,784 --> 01:09:19,163
I am only giving you this one chance.

783
01:09:19,255 --> 01:09:23,499
Release the woman and I will let you live.

784
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:39,285
Armando, stay there.

785
01:10:25,354 --> 01:10:28,392
Do you have a cigarette?

786
01:10:28,457 --> 01:10:31,404
Yes.

787
01:10:36,765 --> 01:10:40,212
What the fuck, Armando?

788
01:10:40,269 --> 01:10:42,647
You never learned how to roll a cigarette.

789
01:10:42,705 --> 01:10:45,151
I am sorry.

790
01:10:53,515 --> 01:10:58,589
Damn it. I'm dying
and you're giving me this piece of shit?

791
01:11:01,857 --> 01:11:04,997
I'm sorry.

792
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:06,061
Brother.

793
01:11:06,128 --> 01:11:08,904
Yes?

794
01:11:08,998 --> 01:11:12,536
She loves you.

795
01:11:13,869 --> 01:11:15,940
I just realized this.

796
01:11:16,005 --> 01:11:19,817
Go and get her.

797
01:11:20,009 --> 01:11:24,151
Damn, our father would have loved
to have seen that.

798
01:11:24,213 --> 01:11:25,715
Go. Go get her.

799
01:11:29,018 --> 01:11:31,123
It's over.

800
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:32,357
I'm going to meet father now.

801
01:11:32,421 --> 01:11:33,422
Stay here.

802
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:34,490
No.

803
01:11:34,556 --> 01:11:35,557
Please.

804
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:41,574
Mexico will be a better place without me.

805
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:43,974
It's time.

806
01:12:44,993 --> 01:12:47,769
I am Armando Alvarez.

807
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:50,174
I have come for your life.

808
01:12:50,232 --> 01:12:52,712
How dare you come in like that.

809
01:12:52,768 --> 01:12:55,977
Just like that, without an invitation?

810
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:58,416
You invited me when you took my woman.

811
01:12:58,474 --> 01:13:00,420
You want her?

812
01:13:00,476 --> 01:13:01,682
Here you go!

813
01:13:34,610 --> 01:13:37,181
And now,

814
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:38,953
you both shall die!

815
01:13:39,515 --> 01:13:40,960
Armando!

816
01:14:23,091 --> 01:14:27,267
Oh, damn it.

817
01:14:27,362 --> 01:14:31,606
I always thought that

818
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:34,671
when this moment arrived

819
01:14:34,736 --> 01:14:39,185
there would be a lot of people.

820
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:42,346
A lot of TV networks.

821
01:14:42,511 --> 01:14:44,991
Police.

822
01:14:45,047 --> 01:14:49,928
The army, the president, and everything...

823
01:14:50,953 --> 01:14:56,767
I won't be there, I won't be able to see it.

824
01:15:02,364 --> 01:15:03,866
Oh, shit.

825
01:15:57,519 --> 01:15:58,930
Armando Alvarez.

826
01:15:58,987 --> 01:16:01,866
You are under arrest for murder

827
01:16:01,924 --> 01:16:03,961
and the trafficking of illegal drugs.

828
01:16:04,026 --> 01:16:07,166
You will be extradited to the United States,

829
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:08,799
where you will stand trial.

830
01:16:08,864 --> 01:16:11,071
No, Mr. Blancardo,

831
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:13,236
there will be no trial.

832
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:15,681
- For my mother.
- You son of a bitch!

833
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:46,542
You are out of luck, wetback.

834
01:16:54,810 --> 01:17:01,056
Not all Americans are bad, Armando.

835
01:17:06,188 --> 01:17:11,069
Not all Mexicans are drug dealers.

836
01:17:13,495 --> 01:17:14,872
Are you ready, Sonia?

837
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:16,204
Yes.

838
01:17:16,264 --> 01:17:18,540
Let's go home.

839
01:17:20,702 --> 01:17:21,874
Bye.

840
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:24,784
Bye.

841
01:17:35,484 --> 01:17:37,395
Do you want to walk?

842
01:19:08,777 --> 01:19:11,849
<i>With every season comes a change</i>

843
01:19:11,913 --> 01:19:16,362
<i>A season ends and a new one comes</i>

844
01:19:17,452 --> 01:19:20,763
<i>But now a season has come to us</i>

845
01:19:20,822 --> 01:19:25,100
<i>It's a no good season</i>

846
01:19:26,394 --> 01:19:30,001
<i>A bird has wings so he can fly</i>

847
01:19:30,065 --> 01:19:34,571
<i>His home is up in the sky</i>

848
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:39,543
<i>His home is where his heart can sing</i>

849
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:43,750
<i>Unless he has a broken wing</i>

850
01:19:46,915 --> 01:19:51,261
<i>My whole life has been a struggle</i>

851
01:19:51,319 --> 01:19:55,961
<i>I've chased a dream within a bubble</i>

852
01:19:56,024 --> 01:19:59,631
<i>And now that dream is fading slow</i>

853
01:19:59,694 --> 01:20:06,236
<i>I've made a world only I can know</i>

854
01:20:09,404 --> 01:20:12,908
<i>Is this the end of what we are?</i>

855
01:20:13,775 --> 01:20:17,621
<i>What we were is long ago</i>

856
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:22,485
<i>I will not let this come to pass</i>

857
01:20:22,551 --> 01:20:27,159
<i>My name is Armando Alvarez</i>

858
01:20:27,856 --> 01:20:31,360
<i>Is there a world where love is free?</i>

859
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:36,031
<i>A world where love was meant for me</i>

860
01:20:36,097 --> 01:20:42,480
<i>Must I always fight for love?</i>

861
01:21:20,108 --> 01:21:23,317
<i>I will save my family</i>

862
01:21:24,246 --> 01:21:27,750
<i>From this greed and tyranny</i>

863
01:21:28,917 --> 01:21:32,421
<i>God will help me from above</i>

864
01:21:32,621 --> 01:21:36,125
<i>Must I always</i>

865
01:21:37,158 --> 01:21:40,332
<i>I will definitely</i>

866
01:21:41,363 --> 01:21:48,372
<i>Fight for love!</i>

01:21:57,812 --> 01:21:59,758
