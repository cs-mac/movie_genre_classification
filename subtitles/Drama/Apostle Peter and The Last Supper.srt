1
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,161
<i>You know, I told him</i>

2
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,494
<i>This shelf smells
like a privy.</i>

3
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:56,034
<i>I will treat it as such.</i>

4
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:59,904
Captain, reporting
with a new prisoner.

5
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,674
Signed by
the emperor.

6
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,042
Shut your mouth.

7
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:15,714
<i>Looks like we've caught
quite a fish today.</i>

8
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,689
Mystical insurrection
against the empire.

9
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,089
You, dirty old beggar?

10
00:01:21,148 --> 00:01:24,129
<i>Sir, he's of The Way.</i>

11
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:25,458
Martinian, is it?

12
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:26,793
Yes, sir.

13
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:28,730
What way? Say what
you mean, guardsman.

14
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:31,030
He's a follower of the one
they call "Jesus the Christ. "

15
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:35,403
<i>Jesus the Christ,
a religious fanatic.</i>

16
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:39,239
Is that all we get
here these days?

17
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:51,213
Name?

18
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:52,552
What is his name?

19
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,251
Simon Peter of Galilee.

20
00:01:54,314 --> 00:01:56,055
They call him
"the fisherman. "

21
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,390
<i>He knew Jesus.</i>

22
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:58,930
Enough!

23
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,302
Take him to the box.

24
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,969
Let him convert, relax.

25
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:25,690
Father,

26
00:02:28,582 --> 00:02:35,522
thank you for this chance
to suffer for you.

27
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:45,343
Thy will be done.

28
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,693
<i>When do you think
they will pass his sentence?</i>

29
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,962
<i>Do you really think
he knew this Jesus?</i>

30
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,197
<i>We should question him.</i>

31
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:18,710
<i>Maninian, you'd rather look
at some old fool than your wife?</i>

32
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:20,039
<i>Go home.</i>

33
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,374
<i>Calm yourself.</i>

34
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:23,915
<i>You'll be ﬁne by yourself?</i>

35
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,247
<i>I think I can
handle watching a door.</i>

36
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:31,255
<i>Right, well,
I'll see you in the morning.</i>

37
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,611
Is it you, Lord?

38
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:01,553
Ask your God
to save us.

39
00:04:05,278 --> 00:04:08,919
Are you afraid
he'll deny you?

40
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:16,352
Am I to be judged silently
by an assassin's blade

41
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:21,161
in the night?

42
00:05:25,725 --> 00:05:27,966
No...

43
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:31,840
that face has
never seen murder,

44
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:35,175
<i>much less committed it.</i>

45
00:05:35,235 --> 00:05:38,216
I'm not supposed
to give you this.

46
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:44,713
<i>So were you
a priest or a prophet?</i>

47
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:47,258
I am a fisherman.

48
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:58,735
Lord Jesus,
thank you for this food,

49
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:03,673
<i>bless it to my body
and body to your service.</i>

50
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:08,201
Thank you
for my captors.

51
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:12,648
<i>I pray for their hearts
to be open to you.</i>

52
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,516
<i>Amen.</i>

53
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,985
So-

54
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,686
what is your price?

55
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,024
What?

56
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:31,661
<i>What do you seek in
payment for this forbidden meal?</i>

57
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:38,700
Just a-just a chat,
something to pass the hours.

58
00:06:41,768 --> 00:06:45,409
Yeah right,
it's my wife, my Novella.

59
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:48,612
She's heard about these
Christians and their Way.

60
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:49,949
And your Messiah,
this Jesus,

61
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,854
she's insatiably
curious about him.

62
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,551
<i>I've warned her
repeatedly to be careful,</i>

63
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:58,687
<i>but you know women,</i>

64
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,858
or perhaps you don't.

65
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:06,871
<i>Here I am with one of the most
famous Christians in my charge.</i>

66
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,931
There's no harm to
ask him a few questions,

67
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:13,102
for her sake.

68
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:17,774
Ask, and it shall
be given to you;

69
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:20,374
seek,
and ye shall find.

70
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,977
<i>What, did he say that?</i>

71
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:26,047
Your God, your Jesus?

72
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:31,221
He said, "Come to me,

73
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:37,235
"all those who are weary
and heavy laden,

74
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,238
"and I will give you rest,

75
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:45,902
peace.

76
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:49,277
Do you want peace?

77
00:07:49,336 --> 00:07:51,748
Don't get any ideas.

78
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,149
The gods are
good enough for me.

79
00:07:54,207 --> 00:07:59,486
<i>And what of
the life after this one?</i>

80
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:01,492
Are you prepared
for that?

81
00:08:01,548 --> 00:08:03,824
<i>You really
think you could convert me</i>

82
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,863
to living a life
of persecution?

83
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,925
<i>No, to
living a life of hope</i>

84
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:13,767
with an inheritance that can

85
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:18,799
never perish,
spoil, nor fade.

86
00:08:22,535 --> 00:08:24,446
<i>Is that so?</i>

87
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:28,213
Do you care to make
a wager on that?

88
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:33,451
If you can convert me,
I'M set you free.

89
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:37,461
That wager would not
be fair for you.

90
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:41,021
Well, we will talk then,

91
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,294
and you will tell me
of your God,

92
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,132
and you will
meet your match, Simon Peter.

93
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,138
<i>If that is your wish,</i>

94
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:52,165
but I thought it was your
wife who was interested.

95
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,829
Processus.

96
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,235
Don't think you'll
get away with that easily.

97
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,704
I don't know what
you're talking about.

98
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,399
Fraternizing
with a prisoner.

99
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:24,737
It was merely
an interrogation.

100
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:26,072
On whose orders?

101
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:27,907
My own.

102
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:31,073
I should report this.

103
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:32,673
Are we to open
Pandora's Box

104
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,377
and report each
other's transgressions,

105
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:37,183
dear Processus?

106
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:41,749
Should I report
the gambling?

107
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:43,795
The women?

108
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:46,694
The missing wife?

109
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,734
The lightened coffers?

110
00:09:52,792 --> 00:09:56,638
I was wondering when
you might grow a backbone.

111
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:59,040
Why is he so important
to you, anyway?

112
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,373
He's a famous man.

113
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,741
I've never met
a famous man.

114
00:10:01,801 --> 00:10:04,372
I'm curious.

115
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,974
Don't get
too attached.

116
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,884
His sentence?

117
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:35,773
<i>There's no reward
waiting for you in the Kingdom.</i>

118
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:40,682
<i>My master can free you
from this suffering</i>

119
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,415
<i>and provide great riches.</i>

120
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,947
All you need do
is deny him,

121
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,584
<i>as you did before.</i>

122
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:52,425
<i>That was long ago!</i>

123
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:56,433
<i>I have been forgiven.</i>

124
00:10:56,489 --> 00:11:02,269
<i>Do not speak to me about your
temporary earthly riches.</i>

125
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:08,301
<i>I now have
everlasting riches</i>

126
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:10,974
<i>beyond anything
that you can provide.</i>

127
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:14,484
Have you?

128
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:18,717
Has your Father
told you that.

129
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:23,056
<i>My master
told me a secret.</i>

130
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:26,620
Perhaps he will
tell you too,

131
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,359
<i>when you meet him.</i>

132
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:31,129
That I shall die
in 3 days?

133
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,233
<i>Be gone, demon!</i>

134
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:40,836
Three days,
Simon Peter,

135
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,313
<i>three days,
and you're mine.</i>

136
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,816
<i>In the name of Jesus,</i>

137
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,318
I cast you out!

138
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:52,051
Did you hear that?

139
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:54,648
<i>A shriek in the cells?
What of it?</i>

140
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,250
Well, perhaps
we should check.

141
00:11:56,316 --> 00:11:59,195
Perhaps you
should relax.

142
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:11,401
Ah, that-
that's disgusting.

143
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:13,341
You'll get
used to it,

144
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,673
<i>the screams,</i>

145
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,112
the filth.

146
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:22,049
So what do you
think of the gods?

147
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:24,088
Ugh!

148
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,285
You are boring!

149
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:30,453
Is this what happens
when you marry?

150
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:32,587
What if they're right?

151
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:35,758
What if their one God
is greater than the Olympians?

152
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:37,893
So join them.

153
00:12:37,957 --> 00:12:40,699
I have a cell
just your size ready.

154
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,070
No...

155
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:45,040
No, I will not endanger
my wife like that,

156
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:50,070
but still I'm troubled
with what we're doing.

157
00:12:55,608 --> 00:13:00,580
<i>They say these Christians
go quietly to their deaths.</i>

158
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:07,326
Makes my job easier.

159
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:10,231
I mean, it's amazing
they get any converts at all.

160
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,099
What could this cult
possibly offer a man

161
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:14,229
for him to risk his
freedom and his life?

162
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:18,743
Who cares, as long as there's
coin in rounding them up?

163
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,744
Your heart is as
black as this place.

164
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,780
Thank you.

165
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,783
I will find out more.

166
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:29,115
I didn't see a thing.

167
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:35,620
<i>Did you really know him?</i>

168
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:39,596
<i>The one they call
the King of the Jews?</i>

169
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:45,295
You truly mean to hear
my story, don't you?

170
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,770
I do.

171
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:51,502
<i>Did he really rise
from the dead?</i>

172
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:56,104
<i>The story
begins long before that day.</i>

173
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,614
I have time.

174
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,514
Tell me everything.

175
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,519
You may have time;

176
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:06,284
however, I have but
3 days left to my life.

177
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,348
<i>Who told you that?</i>

178
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,189
How do you know that?

179
00:14:10,249 --> 00:14:14,459
<i>If the forces
that surround me frighten you,</i>

180
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,023
then this is not
a tale for your ears.

181
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,195
I want to know,
I need to know.

182
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,636
Your one God, is he
greater than all the rest?

183
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:25,506
<i>There
is only one true God.</i>

184
00:14:25,565 --> 00:14:27,545
But how do you know?

185
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,424
<i>Jesus himself said,</i>

186
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:47,329
<i>"I am the way,
the truth, and the life.</i>

187
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:53,201
<i>No one comes to the
Father, but through me. "</i>

188
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:59,241
He had power
over the storms,

189
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:02,279
made the lame walk
and the blind see.

190
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:05,441
<i>He healed the lepers</i>

191
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:09,009
and made the dead rise.

192
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,282
So you were friends
with this Jesus?

193
00:15:11,344 --> 00:15:14,416
A prophet?
A living God?

194
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,926
What of us, if we're
to put you to death?

195
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:18,462
Peace.

196
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:27,628
I will tell you
of Jesus, our Lord.

197
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:34,412
First...

198
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:37,414
I knew him
as a man.

199
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,216
<i>Brother</i>

200
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,551
Hurry, Simon!

201
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,284
He called to us!

202
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,952
There, there,
I can see him,

203
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:51,723
I can see him!

204
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,092
Come on, brother!
Hurry up!

205
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:55,928
He is this way!

206
00:15:55,988 --> 00:16:00,562
<i>We have to get
home and tend to Mother!</i>

207
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,606
There, Simon, hurry!

208
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:04,005
He is there!
Come on!

209
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:05,599
Andrew!

210
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,469
Andrew.

211
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:44,438
<i>As I gazed upon him,</i>

212
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:48,041
<i>I was afraid-
not of him.</i>

213
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:51,316
<i>His presence was like
all the light and love</i>

214
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,482
<i>and goodness of the world.</i>

215
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:58,052
<i>No, I was afraid for myself}
for I knew at that moment</i>

216
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:03,226
<i>that my life would now
become about him.</i>

217
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:06,793
<i>But what was I,
a simple ﬁsherman,</i>

218
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:11,831
<i>strong enough
to face such a life?</i>

219
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:19,543
You are Simon,
son of John.

220
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:22,586
You will be called Peter.

221
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:31,017
<i>Tell me, brothers,
who do people say that I am?</i>

222
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:39,333
There are those that say you
are John the Baptist or Elijah,

223
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:44,501
but mostly people
say you are a prophet,

224
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:48,341
but they don't
know for sure.

225
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,779
And what about you?

226
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:55,286
<i>Who do you say I am?</i>

227
00:17:55,341 --> 00:18:00,347
You are the Christ,
the Son of the living God.

228
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:05,522
<i>Then Jesus
walked with us to our home by the sea,</i>

229
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:09,863
<i>where my wife's
mother lay dying.</i>

230
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:13,631
Her sickness was deep.

231
00:18:13,693 --> 00:18:18,073
<i>It was the kind
no remedy could cure,</i>

232
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:21,543
<i>but Jesus reached
out his hand.</i>

233
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:48,568
<i>Before my eyes,
he had banished the sickness.</i>

234
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:53,475
<i>This was but one of many
miracles he performed,</i>

235
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:57,003
<i>seen by many witnesses.</i>

236
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:06,586
That is quite a story,

237
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:09,490
if any of it's true.

238
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:12,530
Why would I be false?

239
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:15,088
What would I gain?

240
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,327
<i>You have nothing
I want.</i>

241
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,835
Not even freedom?

242
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:23,101
<i>As I said,
you have nothing I want.</i>

243
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,039
<i>Even if I believe you,</i>

244
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:26,940
<i>I've already
made up my mind.</i>

245
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,945
You are clearly insane.

246
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,844
In what respect?

247
00:19:30,903 --> 00:19:32,280
Well, any man who
wishes good health

248
00:19:32,338 --> 00:19:34,614
upon his
mother-in-law is-

249
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,312
mad.

250
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,850
Your wits are
sharp, soldier.

251
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,483
What is your name?

252
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,528
Martinian.

253
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:50,291
Would you hear
more of Jesus

254
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:54,896
and accept what
I say is the truth?

255
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:56,235
I will listen well.

256
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:04,307
It's only a rooster.

257
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,408
<i>The sound
offends you?</i>

258
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:09,453
It reminds me.

259
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:15,992
<i>Reminds you of what?</i>

260
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:20,758
I denied my Lord.

261
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:25,326
I denied him,
not once,

262
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:28,861
but three times.

263
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:34,707
You sinned
against your Lord?

264
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:37,338
I denied him.

265
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:42,284
<i>You were not cast
out from his fellowship?</i>

266
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:48,314
Man can be weak
in the heart and mind.

267
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,733
Our Lord knew this.

268
00:20:59,592 --> 00:21:01,037
<i>I say to you,</i>

269
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:04,370
anyone who
commits any sin

270
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:08,207
<i>is a slave to sin,</i>

271
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:12,215
and a slave does not
remain in the house forever.

272
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:16,083
The Son remains forever.

273
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:19,783
<i>So if the Son
sets you free,</i>

274
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:24,316
you will be
free indeed.

275
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,059
<i>The emperor can forgive.</i>

276
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,757
<i>A magistrate can forgive.</i>

277
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:30,095
Beg for their forgiveness.

278
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:33,262
Deny your Lord,
and you could go free.

279
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:35,236
I am already free.

280
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,137
What, even in chains?

281
00:21:37,196 --> 00:21:39,574
You are the one
in chains, Martinian,

282
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,134
<i>not I.</i>

283
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,237
Free yourself.

284
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,441
So you will do nothing?

285
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:49,919
You will sit here
and wait for death?

286
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,251
With Christ,

287
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,019
death is only
a beginning.

288
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:58,085
<i>And what
of me, Simon Peter,</i>

289
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,686
and my question?

290
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:02,289
Let's say you're right.

291
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:06,268
Who would forgive my sin,
being your jailer,

292
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,362
jailer to the personal
friend of God?

293
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:12,671
<i>Forgiveness
is only found in Jesus,</i>

294
00:22:12,731 --> 00:22:15,712
our Lord.

295
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,130
So, I should, uh-

296
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:40,799
Yeah.

297
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,134
Home to your wife.

298
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:46,336
Leave a real soldier
to do his job.

299
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,835
Forgiven?

300
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:15,338
You?

301
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:21,106
You are a fool to die.

302
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:25,342
Christ has forsaken you.

303
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:28,044
God has forsaken you.

304
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:30,053
You are alone!

305
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:33,056
I am not alone!

306
00:23:33,112 --> 00:23:39,085
Jesus says, "I will neither
leave you nor forsake you. "

307
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:45,531
Nothing better to do
than rile at the rabble

308
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:48,572
with talk of gods?

309
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:55,809
How could you follow
a leader like that?

310
00:23:55,868 --> 00:24:00,408
King of the Jews, right?

311
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:04,249
We were more like soldiers
following our General.

312
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:09,282
<i>Can't you imagine the
different kind of leader,</i>

313
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:13,296
<i>one where the lower
soldier is as important</i>

314
00:24:13,352 --> 00:24:16,890
as the highest general?

315
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:20,130
You mean I would have the
same stature as the officers?

316
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:23,139
Why would any general
agree to that?

317
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:30,135
There is a difference between
leading and love of your people,

318
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:33,979
versus having
the love of power,

319
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:38,351
<i>the greed of leadership.</i>

320
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:42,085
Man was born with
the desire to rule.

321
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,253
What if your
general loved you

322
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:51,434
and felt that all men
were created equal?

323
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:56,997
<i>Jesus was that
kind of a general.</i>

324
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:59,633
<i>My brother Andrew and I</i>

325
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:02,770
<i>were among the
ﬁrst of the disciples,</i>

326
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:06,282
<i>captains, you might say.</i>

327
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,612
You're mistaken,
Brother.

328
00:25:07,673 --> 00:25:09,277
The Master clearly
called me first.

329
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,615
You are mistaken.

330
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:13,020
I told you that
we found the Messiah.

331
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:14,785
I was in the boat
when Jesus called,

332
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,121
"Come, follow me. "

333
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,455
We were in the
boat together.

334
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,018
He called to us
at the same time.

335
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:22,065
Yes, yes, but I was
closer to the shore.

336
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:27,862
<i>There was
John and James, the sons of Zebedee,</i>

337
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:30,167
<i>whom Jesus cherished.</i>

338
00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:31,970
Mother wanted me to sit
on Jesus rig ht hand.

339
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:33,305
And you on the left.

340
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,901
Why am I to be
on the left?

341
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:36,241
Mother has
no say in this.

342
00:25:36,302 --> 00:25:38,475
You be on the left.
I will be on the right.

343
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:41,177
James, Jesus loves me
better than you.

344
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,242
Hmph, we will see
about that.

345
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:49,419
<i>There was
Philip, Nathaniel, and Thomas,</i>

346
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:52,587
<i>James, the son of Alpheus;</i>

347
00:25:52,651 --> 00:25:54,528
<i>Thaddeus;</i>

348
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:57,260
<i>Simon, the Canaanite;</i>

349
00:25:57,323 --> 00:26:02,102
<i>Matthew the tax collector;</i>

350
00:26:02,161 --> 00:26:07,907
<i>and, of course,
there was Judas.</i>

351
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:11,937
<i>But Jesus knew what
was in our hearts.</i>

352
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:25,362
<i>The Master spoke of giving
power beyond comprehension.</i>

353
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:30,196
Heal the sick,

354
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:33,532
cleanse the lepers,

355
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,232
raise the dead,

356
00:26:36,295 --> 00:26:39,401
<i>drive out demons.</i>

357
00:26:39,465 --> 00:26:41,911
<i>Freely you have received;</i>

358
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:45,414
therefore, give freely.

359
00:26:45,471 --> 00:26:48,941
<i>Suppose it
doesn't work, Lord?</i>

360
00:26:49,008 --> 00:26:54,117
<i>Suppose I rebuke a demon,
and it refuses to leave?</i>

361
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:58,321
<i>There are times
when it will be more work.</i>

362
00:26:58,384 --> 00:27:03,356
Some can only be driven out
by prayer and fasting.

363
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,830
Witchcraft and magic.

364
00:27:07,893 --> 00:27:10,737
That is not
what I speak of.

365
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:16,075
<i>I speak of
the true power,</i>

366
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:18,741
which can only
come from God.

367
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:21,148
<i>Not
very nice of you.</i>

368
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:24,653
Your Lord gives you powers,
yet you deny him three times?

369
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:28,089
You have much
anger in you.

370
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:34,098
<i>You have a wish for
true love in your life,</i>

371
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:37,999
peace, happiness.

372
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:40,332
Show me these
powers of yours.

373
00:27:40,392 --> 00:27:41,996
<i>Prove it.</i>

374
00:27:42,061 --> 00:27:45,531
You are not ill.

375
00:27:45,597 --> 00:27:47,770
<i>You are not
beset by demons.</i>

376
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:51,474
<i>What would you
have me do?</i>

377
00:27:52,938 --> 00:27:55,441
<i>Hmph, ﬁgures.</i>

378
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,509
<i>I would have you
be crucified</i>

379
00:27:57,576 --> 00:28:00,557
and die
a rebel's death.

380
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,849
<i>Oh, did no one
tell you?</i>

381
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:05,953
Now, I've gone and
spoiled the surprise.

382
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:07,656
It cannot be
that way.

383
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:10,996
<i>Let's see how quickly
your knees turn to water.</i>

384
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:14,230
<i>You misunderstand</i>

385
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:20,141
I am not worthy to die
in the same manner

386
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,179
as blessed Jesus.

387
00:28:22,234 --> 00:28:23,804
What?

388
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:28,181
You think it's some
kind of honor?

389
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,220
You're insane.

390
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:02,943
Martinian,
you will come with me.

391
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:04,851
You got me.

392
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,220
You will come
with me now!

393
00:29:23,462 --> 00:29:24,941
What's this all about?

394
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:27,375
An agent with the seal of the
emperor wants to question you

395
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,242
about your talks with
this Christian rebel.

396
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,603
Martinian-

397
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:57,399
Martinian,
what's wrong?

398
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:04,514
What are you
doing here?

399
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:06,310
This is no
place for you.

400
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:07,748
Is he
really here?

401
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,080
Is who here?

402
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:10,415
Simon Peter,
of course.

403
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:14,082
The one they call
the Prince of the apostles.

404
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:16,752
He is here.

405
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,351
Why did you not
mention it?

406
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:21,364
Must I tell you of every
prisoner now, Wife?

407
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,161
Do not attempt that
tone with me, Husband.

408
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:26,794
You'll only
embarrass yourself.

409
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:28,860
Yes, he's here.

410
00:30:28,927 --> 00:30:32,534
I've even spoken to him,
asked him questions.

411
00:30:32,598 --> 00:30:34,942
Well, you've asked him
all the wrong questions.

412
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,638
You don't even know
what I've asked.

413
00:30:36,702 --> 00:30:39,273
I know you've asked
the wrong thing.

414
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,782
And what would be
the correct question?

415
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,614
Ask him for a
blessing, of course,

416
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,154
for my womb, so I may
bear you a child.

417
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,520
That is
dangerous talk.

418
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:49,286
I know your interest
in these Christians,

419
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:51,123
but better not
go further.

420
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,628
It doesn't,
does it?

421
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,129
No, of course not.

422
00:30:54,186 --> 00:30:55,460
I'm serious.

423
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,124
I will not lose you
to this cult.

424
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:58,463
I hear you.

425
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,504
You have made
yourself clear.

426
00:31:04,096 --> 00:31:07,339
I'm also curious
about this man,

427
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:09,504
but I will not ask
for his blessing.

428
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:13,015
That crosses
the line.

429
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:14,641
I will ask him
one question.

430
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,312
Will that suffice?

431
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:18,912
Now; if you need
time to think-

432
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:23,426
I- I want to know
how Jesus really died,

433
00:31:23,482 --> 00:31:25,018
and the days
leading up to his death,

434
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:27,495
and-

435
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,930
Well, ask him that,

436
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:33,959
and you shall be allowed
to sleep in the bed tonight.

437
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:41,009
<i>All right,
I have a question.</i>

438
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:43,675
Not so circumspect today.

439
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,545
Are you eager to hear
tales of my Master?

440
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:50,052
There is one tale
in particular I would hear:

441
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:51,678
the death of your Lord.

442
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,745
<i>How did it come about?</i>

443
00:31:53,812 --> 00:31:56,520
That is a tale
both sad and glorious.

444
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,528
<i>I'm surprised you do not
know the answer already.</i>

445
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:03,862
<i>I know some
whispers, rumors.</i>

446
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:07,699
I would hear the truth of
it from one who lived it.

447
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,534
<i>They say he
was betrayed?</i>

448
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,198
Yes, he was.

449
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,209
<i>Who was it?
Why did he do it?</i>

450
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:14,608
<i>Please, I must hear.</i>

451
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:16,407
I have to be sure.

452
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:18,880
<i>If your Master
is the true Son of God,</i>

453
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:23,044
and you are his
right hand, I will be-

454
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:26,248
I fear for my soul.

455
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:30,657
Ilf I tell you this story,
and you know my words are true,

456
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:36,631
<i>will you then accept
Jesus as your Lord?</i>

457
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:40,659
I will listen well.
I promise nothing more.

458
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,677
<i>Where shall I begin?</i>

459
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:52,977
<i>It was on the night
of the Passover feast.</i>

460
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:56,747
<i>Jesus summoned us
all to dine with him.</i>

461
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,412
<i>There was an inn.</i>

462
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:02,755
<i>There was an upper room
away from all eyes.</i>

463
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:07,126
<i>There was a table
set for 13.</i>

464
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:09,631
<i>I had walked
with Jesus,</i>

465
00:33:09,688 --> 00:33:15,036
<i>seen many wondrous
and terrible things.</i>

466
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:20,634
<i>I thought I had become wise
and learned of the world,</i>

467
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:23,441
<i>burl was not prepared
to hear the secrets</i>

468
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:28,474
<i>this room would reveal.</i>

469
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:34,013
Brother, join me.

470
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:36,787
Who would've thought that
two fishermen from Galilee

471
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:41,194
would be here
in this room?

472
00:33:41,253 --> 00:33:44,723
My hands have lost
their roughness.

473
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:49,170
As have mine.

474
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:52,572
Do you miss it?

475
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:55,635
We're still
fishermen, Brother.

476
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,840
Now we cast our
nets for the Lord.

477
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,655
Who's supposed
to wash our feet?

478
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,565
Philip, you didn't arrange
for servants to wash our feet?

479
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:21,365
The Master did not tell me
to provide for servants.

480
00:34:21,426 --> 00:34:24,100
Must you be
told everything?

481
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:25,766
Should we wash
our own feet?

482
00:34:25,830 --> 00:34:27,867
Well, I'm not.

483
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:32,510
Well, where do we sit?

484
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:35,074
We should wait for the Master
to assign places of honor.

485
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,414
Well, why wait then?

486
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:37,748
The order is
always the same.

487
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:39,584
Judas, welcome.

488
00:34:39,644 --> 00:34:41,351
<i>Are the others
far behind?</i>

489
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,393
They come.

490
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:47,130
It's been decided we'd wait
for the Master before we sit.

491
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:48,459
You can wait.

492
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,431
I've walked all day.

493
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:52,866
<i>As have I.</i>

494
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:09,984
<i>And so we
sat, we talked, and we laughed,</i>

495
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:15,787
<i>even persecuted,
even hunted as we were.</i>

496
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:20,387
<i>We laughed because
Jesus was still with us.</i>

497
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:35,741
And then he entered,

498
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,907
<i>and then there
was no more laughter,</i>

499
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:43,680
<i>not for a long,
long time.</i>

500
00:35:43,742 --> 00:35:49,090
I have greatly desired
to eat this Passover with you

501
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,650
before I suffer;

502
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:55,186
for I tell you,
I will not eat it again

503
00:35:55,253 --> 00:36:01,169
until it finds its fulfillment
in the kingdom of God.

504
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:27,028
Blessed are you,
O Lord, our God,

505
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:29,224
King of the universe,

506
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:31,289
<i>who chose
and sanctified us</i>

507
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:34,064
<i>with your commandments</i>

508
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:39,700
<i>and who gave us appointed times
for happiness: festivals.</i>

509
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:44,804
<i>And times for joy,
the day of this festival, Lord;</i>

510
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,645
<i>the festival of matzah.</i>

511
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:52,155
<i>He spoke
the prayer of joy and of thanks,</i>

512
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,690
<i>but there was no
joy in the room.</i>

513
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:58,319
<i>He was still a beacon
of love and light,</i>

514
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:04,197
<i>but over the rest of us
a shadow fell.</i>

515
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:18,079
Take and eat.

516
00:37:18,136 --> 00:37:24,109
This is my body,
which is broken for you.

517
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:32,695
Do this in
remembrance of me.

518
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:14,592
Drink from this cup,
all of you,

519
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:19,074
for this is my blood
of the new covenant,

520
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:23,442
which is shed for many
for the forgiveness of sins.

521
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:28,348
Do this in
remembrance of me.

522
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:16,225
So what did it mean,
the drinking of the wine

523
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:19,325
and the eating
of the bread?

524
00:39:19,391 --> 00:39:21,200
This is the symbol
of the new covenant

525
00:39:21,259 --> 00:39:25,571
<i>in remembrance
of his death.</i>

526
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:31,308
<i>You are those who
stood by me in all my trials,</i>

527
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:35,476
<i>and I confer
on you a kingdom,</i>

528
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:42,253
even as my Father
conferred his kingdom upon me.

529
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:44,088
Pete r-

530
00:39:44,149 --> 00:39:50,031
<i>Satan intends to sift
you like wheat,</i>

531
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:51,658
but I have prayed
for you, Peter,

532
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:55,034
that your faith
may not fail.

533
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:58,836
And when you have
turned back, I say to you,

534
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:01,503
you will encourage
your brothers.

535
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:04,740
<i>Lord, I am prepared to go
with you to prison and to death!</i>

536
00:40:04,803 --> 00:40:09,252
<i>I tell you Peter,
before the rooster crows today,</i>

537
00:40:09,307 --> 00:40:15,189
you will disown me
three times.

538
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:30,940
<i>No wonder you hate to
hear the crowing of the rooster.</i>

539
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:32,736
I was a fool.

540
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:34,276
But you said
he forgave you.

541
00:40:34,332 --> 00:40:38,747
<i>Yes, later,
not that I deserved it.</i>

542
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:42,216
<i>So Jesus
became the sacrifice.</i>

543
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:45,743
Yes, he was ushering
in the new covenant

544
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:49,087
<i>that his death
would symbolize.</i>

545
00:40:49,147 --> 00:40:52,424
Do you understand?

546
00:40:52,484 --> 00:40:56,227
Not really.

547
00:40:56,287 --> 00:41:01,100
<i>In time, you will.</i>

548
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:04,766
So what happened next?

549
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:14,779
What does he do now?

550
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:17,820
I don't know.

551
00:41:23,348 --> 00:41:26,022
<i>He prepared a
wash basin like a servant?</i>

552
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:29,065
But why?

553
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:36,935
it was to be-

554
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:43,037
one of his
last lessons to us.

555
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:49,143
<i>If only I had
known it,</i>

556
00:41:49,207 --> 00:41:55,886
<i>I would not
have hesitated</i>

557
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:08,967
Lord?

558
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:13,567
You do not understand now,
but later you will understand

559
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:17,636
<i>why I am doing this.</i>

560
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:22,208
No Lord, you will
never wash my feet.

561
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:37,165
If I do not
wash your feet,

562
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:41,499
then you will have
no place in me.

563
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:39,485
He washed your feet?

564
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,052
<i>That's madness!</i>

565
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,463
Your Master,
your so-called living God,

566
00:43:43,521 --> 00:43:47,936
why would he lower himself
to the duties of a slave?

567
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:53,965
No, no leader would lower
himself in his men's eyes.

568
00:43:54,899 --> 00:43:59,780
But Jesus did
lower himself.

569
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:05,084
I do not understand.

570
00:44:05,143 --> 00:44:08,090
Explain this to me.

571
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:13,118
<i>Jesus was talking
about spiritual cleansing.</i>

572
00:44:13,184 --> 00:44:17,826
<i>While we were arguing
about who was the greatest,</i>

573
00:44:17,889 --> 00:44:22,963
<i>Jesus showed us
what loving,</i>

574
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:26,839
humble service
looks like.

575
00:44:26,898 --> 00:44:30,812
But if we are
to love one another,

576
00:44:30,868 --> 00:44:34,941
<i>then how could one
of your own betray Jesus?</i>

577
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:38,453
What you speak of-

578
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:39,783
is the devil.

579
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:43,153
<i>The devil?</i>

580
00:44:43,214 --> 00:44:44,488
<i>What is this?</i>

581
00:44:44,549 --> 00:44:47,496
<i>A dark serpent, Satan.</i>

582
00:44:47,552 --> 00:44:49,828
<i>He works
against God's light,</i>

583
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:51,560
<i>cloaking the world
in violence,</i>

584
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:56,037
<i>hate, and distrust,
turning men against one another.</i>

585
00:44:56,093 --> 00:44:58,004
Sol am damned
as a soldier.

586
00:44:58,062 --> 00:45:00,633
You have a choice,
Martinian.

587
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:03,975
<i>The Lord has given
you a choice;</i>

588
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:09,075
<i>for God wills that
all men should be saved</i>

589
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:11,984
It's not so easy.

590
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:13,989
The devil was
in your ranks.

591
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:15,486
Who was it?

592
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:17,321
<i>How did it happen?</i>

593
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:24,356
After the washing of
feet, the darkness was revealed to us.

594
00:45:25,256 --> 00:45:30,899
<i>I have washed your
feet as an example to you.</i>

595
00:45:30,962 --> 00:45:37,402
<i>Now that you know it,
blessed are you if you do it.</i>

596
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:44,283
<i>A person who has taken a bath
needs only to wash his feet.</i>

597
00:45:44,342 --> 00:45:47,585
<i>His whole body
is clean.</i>

598
00:45:47,645 --> 00:45:51,024
You are clean.

599
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:56,122
But I am not speaking
about all of you.

600
00:45:56,187 --> 00:46:00,795
<i>I know those
who I have chosen,</i>

601
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:05,034
but all this is to bring about
what the Scripture said.

602
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:11,479
Even my close friend,

603
00:46:11,536 --> 00:46:15,985
<i>he who shared my bread,</i>

604
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,281
<i>has lifted up
his heel against me.</i>

605
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:21,323
What does this
mean, Lord?

606
00:46:21,379 --> 00:46:27,421
I am telling you now,
and I tell you the truth.

607
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:35,403
One of you
will betray me.

608
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:40,237
<i>What is he saying?</i>

609
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:41,572
<i>That is impossible!</i>

610
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:42,906
It cannot be!

611
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:44,241
<i>A traitor amongst us?</i>

612
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:47,112
Find the traitor! Tell me,
tell me who it is, Lord!

613
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:01,929
One of the twelve,

614
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:08,028
<i>he who dips his hand
with me in the dish.</i>

615
00:47:08,092 --> 00:47:15,067
Here at this table,
sitting among us as a friend,

616
00:47:16,267 --> 00:47:20,374
<i>is a man
who will betray me.</i>

617
00:47:25,176 --> 00:47:27,952
<i>And
as I looked around the table,</i>

618
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:32,483
<i>I saw the weakness
that lies in all men,</i>

619
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:38,364
even us,
the twelve chosen by God.

620
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:41,403
<i>We were not
above fear.</i>

621
00:47:41,459 --> 00:47:44,838
<i>It was the worst
kind of fear:</i>

622
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:51,039
<i>not fear from without,
but fear from within.</i>

623
00:47:51,102 --> 00:47:54,572
<i>So one by one,
I looked at them,</i>

624
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:58,143
<i>and I saw their fear.</i>

625
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:02,648
<i>No one was
closer to Jesus.</i>

626
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:05,990
<i>No one stood with cleaner
hands before him;</i>

627
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:12,524
<i>and yet, even he was
vulnerable to sin and fear,</i>

628
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:14,729
<i>as any of us.</i>

629
00:48:14,792 --> 00:48:17,102
A traitor?

630
00:48:17,161 --> 00:48:20,665
How can that be?

631
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,871
I know that I have
no such inclination.

632
00:48:23,935 --> 00:48:26,176
Am I not
above reproach?

633
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:29,582
I have been promised
a throne in your kingdom.

634
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,280
How could I betray the Master
who's dedicated his life

635
00:48:32,343 --> 00:48:35,256
to love and unselfishness?

636
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:39,089
At times, my temper
has bested me.

637
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:42,029
James and I would have
called down fire from heaven

638
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:43,690
to smite the Samaritans,

639
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:48,203
so enraged were we
at their disrespect.

640
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:54,107
Will my pride
cause me to stumble?

641
00:48:54,165 --> 00:49:00,309
My intolerance,
my bigotry?

642
00:49:00,371 --> 00:49:03,750
Is it me, Lord?

643
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:13,658
<i>There was
James, the other son of Zebedee,</i>

644
00:49:13,718 --> 00:49:18,792
<i>so ferociously certain
that he could never fail Jesus;</i>

645
00:49:18,856 --> 00:49:24,568
<i>now so afraid
that he could.</i>

646
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:26,574
Show me this traitor.

647
00:49:26,631 --> 00:49:28,838
Bring him to me, that I may
lay down mighty judgment

648
00:49:28,899 --> 00:49:30,572
on his head!

649
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:37,479
You can sometimes
be too kind,

650
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:40,317
too forgiving.

651
00:49:40,378 --> 00:49:43,757
I'm not encumbered
by such.

652
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:49,992
<i>Some even see your mercy
as a sign of weakness.</i>

653
00:49:50,054 --> 00:49:53,661
It cannot be me
you speak of.

654
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:56,933
I'm sure of it.

655
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:59,338
Am I not one
of the sons of thunder?

656
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:06,876
Is my father not
an influential man?

657
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:09,110
I have been promised
a seat at your table,

658
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:10,982
along with
my brother, too.

659
00:50:11,042 --> 00:50:13,613
<i>How could either
of us betray you?</i>

660
00:50:13,678 --> 00:50:17,683
<i>I was there
on the mountain.</i>

661
00:50:17,748 --> 00:50:20,354
I saw you transfigured.

662
00:50:20,418 --> 00:50:23,627
John and I heard
the very voice of God.

663
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:29,300
Only three of us
can claim that.

664
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:35,470
Oh Lord, will my
righteous fury unbalance me?

665
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:40,642
<i>Will I strike out to hurt,
rather than to heal?</i>

666
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:43,617
Is it me, Lord?

667
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:52,323
<i>Thomas,
my friend, must you forever</i>

668
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:57,059
<i>second-guess
yourself and him?</i>

669
00:50:57,121 --> 00:51:01,263
I knew this
would happen.

670
00:51:01,325 --> 00:51:03,737
I saw it from
the first.

671
00:51:03,794 --> 00:51:06,365
I tried to tell them
this would not end well.

672
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:10,173
Now they argue over
the identity of the betrayer.

673
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:14,614
What difference
does it make?

674
00:51:14,672 --> 00:51:17,881
Every act has been
carved in stone

675
00:51:17,942 --> 00:51:21,185
long before
we drew first breath.

676
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:27,218
All our efforts
and dreams are nothing.

677
00:51:28,285 --> 00:51:31,289
Where has it
brought us?

678
00:51:31,355 --> 00:51:35,929
To the brink of ruin.

679
00:51:35,993 --> 00:51:39,463
What if his end
is somehow,

680
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:43,068
someway
a new beginning,

681
00:51:43,134 --> 00:51:46,809
and it's my doubts,
my pessimism that will hinder

682
00:51:46,871 --> 00:51:50,284
the coming
of this new world?

683
00:51:50,341 --> 00:51:56,314
What if it's the darkness of my
own mind that signals his end?

684
00:51:59,383 --> 00:52:01,886
It cannot be.

685
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:12,870
Is it me, Jesus?

686
00:52:17,735 --> 00:52:20,341
<i>Poor Philip.</i>

687
00:52:20,404 --> 00:52:24,580
<i>That was the one time
I couldn't cover him.</i>

688
00:52:24,642 --> 00:52:29,785
<i>The fear was his
to face on his own.</i>

689
00:52:29,847 --> 00:52:34,660
<i>It's probably me.</i>

690
00:52:34,718 --> 00:52:37,130
I'm sure I will make another
mistake along the way

691
00:52:37,187 --> 00:52:38,962
or ask another
foolish question,

692
00:52:39,023 --> 00:52:44,996
and that somehow will
cause all of this to end.

693
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:49,273
Why did Jesus pick me?

694
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:51,370
Is the Lord allowing me
to be such a misfit,

695
00:52:51,435 --> 00:52:55,611
knowing that my foolish ways
will bring upon his demise?

696
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:58,483
<i>But I can think of no other
reason Jesus would invite me</i>

697
00:52:58,542 --> 00:52:59,816
into his kingdom.

698
00:52:59,877 --> 00:53:04,519
I am not worthy of it.

699
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:07,994
Is it me, Lord?

700
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:15,332
You knew the hearts
of all these men so intimately.

701
00:53:15,392 --> 00:53:17,133
<i>They were my brothers</i>

702
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:20,801
<i>together in our love
of Christ.</i>

703
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:25,074
<i>We lived, suffered
through many trials.</i>

704
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:28,981
And what of your
actual brother, Andrew?

705
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:32,020
His heart I knew
best of all.

706
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:41,261
He loved Jesus,
wanted so badly to please him.

707
00:53:43,287 --> 00:53:47,201
Lord?

708
00:53:47,257 --> 00:53:51,069
The traitor
cannot be me.

709
00:53:51,128 --> 00:53:54,439
I am the first.

710
00:53:54,498 --> 00:54:01,473
You-you saw me, and you
called to me, didn't you?

711
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:08,749
<i>I saw you, and I knew you
were the Messiah right away.</i>

712
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:11,793
I brought you
my brother.

713
00:54:11,849 --> 00:54:15,126
Yes, he is talented in
swaying the hearts of men,

714
00:54:15,186 --> 00:54:17,894
but I am a firstborn.

715
00:54:17,955 --> 00:54:22,734
I am the first chosen.

716
00:54:22,793 --> 00:54:27,333
I deserve my place
of honor, don't I?

717
00:54:30,668 --> 00:54:37,643
Or am I only to be known for
being Peters older brother,

718
00:54:39,209 --> 00:54:45,182
<i>destined to live in the
shadow of one greater than I?</i>

719
00:54:46,317 --> 00:54:50,663
Do I have a place in heaven only
because I am Peter's brother?

720
00:54:50,721 --> 00:54:56,899
Will I come to resent it and
thereby fall by the wayside?

721
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:03,036
Will that be my
downfall and yours?

722
00:55:05,669 --> 00:55:08,946
Is it me, Lord?

723
00:55:13,377 --> 00:55:16,017
<i>And what
of you, Simon Peter?</i>

724
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:22,189
Was your mind so full of
dark thoughts and suspicions?

725
00:55:22,252 --> 00:55:27,099
<i>More than
I would have imagined.</i>

726
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:33,506
<i>I felt the same fear</i>

727
00:55:33,564 --> 00:55:38,775
<i>I did on that hilltop</i>

728
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:43,808
<i>the day I ﬁrst saw him.</i>

729
00:55:46,377 --> 00:55:48,323
<i>There can't be a traitor.</i>

730
00:55:48,378 --> 00:55:50,051
It's impossible.

731
00:55:50,114 --> 00:55:54,119
I won't believe it.

732
00:55:54,184 --> 00:56:01,159
But you say there is,
so it must be true.

733
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:09,406
<i>More than likely,
it's Matthew or Simon.</i>

734
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:12,242
I should say something.

735
00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:19,277
Yes, I will stand
and accuse them both.

736
00:56:20,644 --> 00:56:23,557
What am I saying?

737
00:56:23,614 --> 00:56:28,825
Matthew and Simon, they love
you with all of their hearts.

738
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:35,268
<i>Maybe Nathaniel or Philip.</i>

739
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:39,102
Yes, most certainly Philip,
it has to be.

740
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:43,201
Why didn't! see it before?

741
00:56:43,267 --> 00:56:48,580
No, poor simple Philip
has the faith of a child.

742
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:51,620
He would be the
last to betray you.

743
00:56:51,675 --> 00:56:55,680
<i>Who then?</i>

744
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:59,751
Surely not I.

745
00:56:59,817 --> 00:57:02,354
Am I not the rock?

746
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:07,266
<i>Did I not walk
on the water?</i>

747
00:57:07,324 --> 00:57:11,795
And did I not sink
like a rock into the sea

748
00:57:11,862 --> 00:57:17,835
when I lost my faith
and became afraid?

749
00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:23,507
What if it is me?

750
00:57:27,811 --> 00:57:31,619
Is it me, Lord?

751
00:57:44,028 --> 00:57:47,066
Thirty pieces of silver.

752
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,269
Did you know that,
Teacher?

753
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:52,746
The price of a slave.

754
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:58,310
That's all they
think you're worth.

755
00:57:58,375 --> 00:58:01,413
I'm afraid.

756
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:06,587
Am I to be the villain only
because I saw through you?

757
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:09,756
Am I to be punished because
I'm the only one of the twelve

758
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:14,792
who did not
believe your lies?

759
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:21,101
You call yourself
a Savior;

760
00:58:21,165 --> 00:58:25,136
then save yourself.

761
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:32,286
If you will not,
nothing will change.

762
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:38,315
Your life will be meaningless
and your death will be in vain.

763
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:45,999
It appears our Messiah
needs a Messiah.

764
00:58:46,056 --> 00:58:51,369
Who will save you,
Jesus?

765
00:58:51,428 --> 00:58:55,399
Who can save you?

766
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:02,143
It was me, Lord.

767
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:39,243
I will not sit for this!

768
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:44,281
<i>The Master accuses
and then says nothing.</i>

769
00:59:46,683 --> 00:59:50,654
I will not sit for it.

770
00:59:55,926 --> 00:59:57,906
Lord?

771
00:59:59,529 --> 01:00:03,500
Hurry and do
what you must do.

772
01:00:12,976 --> 01:00:14,250
Where is he going?

773
01:00:14,311 --> 01:00:15,756
Teacher,
what is happening?

774
01:00:15,812 --> 01:00:18,793
Is Judas
the betrayer, Lord?

775
01:00:19,783 --> 01:00:26,758
Now is the
Son of man glorified.

776
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,566
<i>Why did he do it?</i>

777
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,473
What could he gain?

778
01:00:35,532 --> 01:00:42,507
Satan the deceive!
had entered into him.

779
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:47,617
<i>He was promised
great rewards.</i>

780
01:00:47,678 --> 01:00:50,284
And did Jesus order
you to go after him?

781
01:00:50,347 --> 01:00:54,625
<i>Jesus
forgave Judas his deed.</i>

782
01:00:54,685 --> 01:00:56,926
I don't understand
this forgiveness.

783
01:00:56,987 --> 01:01:00,366
If a man plots to betray you,
or strikes you,

784
01:01:00,424 --> 01:01:02,267
or steals from you,

785
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:06,796
I mean, how could you
forgive such a man?

786
01:01:06,863 --> 01:01:11,642
Only the
Son of God can.

787
01:01:11,701 --> 01:01:15,615
Jesus-

788
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:18,278
he is the way,

789
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:21,288
the truth,

790
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:23,324
the life.

791
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:29,395
<i>I tell you, do not
resist an evil person.</i>

792
01:01:29,453 --> 01:01:33,333
<i>If someone strikes you
on the right cheek,</i>

793
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:36,030
<i>turn to him the
other cheek, also.</i>

794
01:01:36,093 --> 01:01:39,540
And if someone wants to
sue you and take your shirt,

795
01:01:39,596 --> 01:01:42,076
let him have
your coat, as well.

796
01:01:42,132 --> 01:01:45,477
If someone forces you
to go 1 mile,

797
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:47,845
go with him 2 mile.

798
01:01:47,904 --> 01:01:50,646
Give to the one
who asks you

799
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:52,243
and do not turn away
from the one

800
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:55,847
who wants to
borrow from you.

801
01:01:57,214 --> 01:02:02,357
Again,
I see his wisdom.

802
01:02:02,419 --> 01:02:08,802
Are your eyes
beginning to be opened?

803
01:02:11,161 --> 01:02:13,835
So what happened
to Judas?

804
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:15,740
<i>Judas fled.</i>

805
01:02:46,963 --> 01:02:49,739
<i>Jesus forgave Judas,</i>

806
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,713
<i>but the betrayer
could not forgive himself</i>

807
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:57,081
<i>nor accept Jesus
gift of forgiveness,</i>

808
01:02:57,140 --> 01:03:01,054
<i>so he took
his own life.</i>

809
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:03,489
Easy death
for a traitor.

810
01:03:03,546 --> 01:03:05,219
Some have said so.

811
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:09,253
So then after the supper,
then Jesus was captured?

812
01:03:09,319 --> 01:03:14,632
Yes, though
the hour was late,

813
01:03:14,691 --> 01:03:17,900
<i>Jesus led us out
into the country</i>

814
01:03:17,961 --> 01:03:22,800
<i>to a garden
called Gethsemane.</i>

815
01:03:25,902 --> 01:03:30,578
This night,
you will all fall away.

816
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,814
My friends,

817
01:03:33,877 --> 01:03:39,623
<i>if the world hates you,</i>

818
01:03:39,683 --> 01:03:43,825
know that it
hated me first.

819
01:03:43,887 --> 01:03:47,164
<i>Remember what
I taught you.</i>

820
01:03:47,224 --> 01:03:51,695
No servant is greater
than his master.

821
01:03:51,762 --> 01:03:56,768
<i>If they persecuted me,
they will persecute you also.</i>

822
01:03:56,833 --> 01:04:02,784
<i>Indeed, the day is coming
when anyone who kills you</i>

823
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:05,342
<i>will think he
is pleasing God.</i>

824
01:04:05,408 --> 01:04:06,853
Lord, there's
danger here.

825
01:04:06,910 --> 01:04:08,184
Let us depart.

826
01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:11,316
Listen to my words.

827
01:04:11,381 --> 01:04:14,624
The time is coming when
you will weep and lament,

828
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:18,393
<i>but the world will rejoice;
but I promise you,</i>

829
01:04:18,455 --> 01:04:24,337
your sorrow will
turn into joy.

830
01:04:30,133 --> 01:04:33,239
My Father,

831
01:04:33,303 --> 01:04:36,978
the time has come.

832
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:40,647
Glorify your Son,

833
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:44,089
so that I may
glorify you.

834
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:53,061
<i>As you sent me
into the world,</i>

835
01:04:53,123 --> 01:04:55,433
so I send these

836
01:04:55,492 --> 01:04:59,998
who you have
given to me,

837
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:02,669
into the world.

838
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:06,839
<i>Sit here while
I go and pray.</i>

839
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:08,849
Pete r,

840
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,248
John,

841
01:05:10,307 --> 01:05:11,877
James,

842
01:05:11,941 --> 01:05:14,512
come.

843
01:05:47,844 --> 01:05:52,850
Remain here and keep
watch while I pray.

844
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:18,118
What is the purpose
of this night?

845
01:06:18,174 --> 01:06:21,451
<i>The Lord ﬁlls our minds
with moments of death,</i>

846
01:06:21,511 --> 01:06:26,358
betrayal, sorrow,
and rejoice.

847
01:06:26,416 --> 01:06:30,023
<i>He bring us here to Gethsemane
in the dark of night to pray?</i>

848
01:06:30,086 --> 01:06:36,059
He's going to his Father
to seek his will.

849
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:40,030
<i>He is sorely troubled</i>

850
01:06:40,096 --> 01:06:42,599
Have we not done enough
to lighten his load?

851
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:45,373
<i>See how he suffers.</i>

852
01:06:45,435 --> 01:06:46,709
<i>Shall we go to him?</i>

853
01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:48,807
He bid us only
to stay and watch.

854
01:06:48,872 --> 01:06:50,442
Watch for what?

855
01:06:50,507 --> 01:06:52,714
<i>Only us twelve know
about this secret place.</i>

856
01:06:52,776 --> 01:06:54,687
<i>That is
what unsettles me.</i>

857
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:57,281
We are twelve
no longer.

858
01:06:57,347 --> 01:07:00,658
One of us
is a betrayer.

859
01:07:00,717 --> 01:07:06,690
Why then would he choose
us three to accompany him?

860
01:07:14,431 --> 01:07:16,638
I feel that I cannot
stay awake.

861
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:18,543
I feel it, too.

862
01:07:18,601 --> 01:07:21,582
A warm night
makes me weary.

863
01:07:21,638 --> 01:07:23,640
We will watch
in shifts.

864
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:26,744
Peter, you stay awake
and watch our Lord.

865
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:28,721
Stay awake with me,
brothers.

866
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:31,657
<i>What if this is how
the betrayal happens,</i>

867
01:07:31,715 --> 01:07:35,686
that we fail our Master's
command and fall asleep?

868
01:07:35,752 --> 01:07:37,527
I'll stay-

869
01:07:44,494 --> 01:07:46,735
I will not
fail you, Lord.

870
01:07:46,796 --> 01:07:50,334
<i>I will stay awake
all night,</i>

871
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:52,380
keep watch.

872
01:08:00,744 --> 01:08:02,223
What?

873
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:09,428
<i>Could you not
watch with me for 1 hour?</i>

874
01:08:09,486 --> 01:08:11,193
Forgive me, Lord.

875
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:12,858
<i>I failed you.</i>

876
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:19,635
The spirit is willing,
but the flesh is weak.

877
01:08:19,696 --> 01:08:23,803
Watch and pray so that you
will not enter into temptation.

878
01:08:23,866 --> 01:08:25,311
Yes.

879
01:09:20,323 --> 01:09:21,597
The betrayal
is at hand!

880
01:09:21,658 --> 01:09:22,966
Brother.

881
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:36,611
<i>Put down your weapon.</i>

882
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:37,946
<i>Remember what
I taught you.</i>

883
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:40,954
He who lives by the sword
will die by the sword.

884
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:43,616
<i>Put down your weapon.</i>

885
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:09,642
Who is it
that you seek?

886
01:10:09,706 --> 01:10:12,708
Jesus of Nazareth.

887
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:22,560
I am he.

888
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:48,620
Lord!

889
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:05,365
<i>This is a
tale for the ages.</i>

890
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:07,908
<i>You swear it all
happened as you say?</i>

891
01:11:07,964 --> 01:11:10,604
Every word.

892
01:11:10,667 --> 01:11:13,546
So they took
Lord Jesus-

893
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:14,980
<i>your Lord Jesus-</i>

894
01:11:15,038 --> 01:11:16,779
and they crucified him?

895
01:11:16,839 --> 01:11:19,547
<i>Tell me of that.</i>

896
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:22,556
it was-

897
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:25,821
witnessed by many.

898
01:11:25,882 --> 01:11:31,161
<i>Jesus our Lord
was crucified</i>

899
01:11:31,221 --> 01:11:34,464
just as it
was prophesied.

900
01:11:34,524 --> 01:11:37,971
<i>He had to die.</i>

901
01:11:38,027 --> 01:11:39,734
I don't understand.

902
01:11:39,796 --> 01:11:41,742
<i>Why did he die?</i>

903
01:11:41,798 --> 01:11:43,937
Why did he not call
his angels to save him,

904
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,412
use his power to come
down from the cross,

905
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:49,245
anything to avoid the
horror of crucifixion?

906
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:52,081
<i>A t
last, we come to it.</i>

907
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:55,145
You are clever,
Martinian.

908
01:11:55,211 --> 01:11:57,589
<i>Your thoughts, we!-</i>

909
01:11:57,647 --> 01:12:02,653
Think back to all that
I have told you of Jesus.

910
01:12:07,757 --> 01:12:11,933
<i>So Jesus said he
would be gloriﬁed in death,</i>

911
01:12:11,995 --> 01:12:15,772
<i>so he must have planned
on being betrayed.</i>

912
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:21,680
So his death was a sacrifice,
but a sacrifice of what?

913
01:12:21,737 --> 01:12:24,843
We were speaking
of sin,

914
01:12:24,908 --> 01:12:27,946
so the sacrifice
was for a sin,

915
01:12:28,011 --> 01:12:29,649
<i>but what sin?</i>

916
01:12:29,712 --> 01:12:32,784
<i>He was pure
and had none.</i>

917
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:37,662
So he died for a sin
that was not his own.

918
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,700
<i>Go on.</i>

919
01:12:45,962 --> 01:12:48,875
Since we've sinned,

920
01:12:48,931 --> 01:12:52,902
he must have died
for our sins.

921
01:12:57,473 --> 01:13:00,750
So when he died,

922
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:05,316
he sacrificed himself
for all our sins.

923
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:08,555
Martinian,
you do understand.

924
01:13:08,618 --> 01:13:11,326
<i>No-</i>

925
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:14,664
No, I-

926
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:17,705
<i>I don't know</i>

927
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:21,333
I think it was better when
I didn't know any of this.

928
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:23,775
I don't think
I'm ready.

929
01:13:23,833 --> 01:13:25,506
If I become
a follower of Jesus,

930
01:13:25,568 --> 01:13:29,175
<i>I might be persecuted
and die like you.</i>

931
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:31,184
How are you not
afraid to die?

932
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:34,687
I do not want to die,

933
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:38,282
<i>burl am not
afraid of death.</i>

934
01:13:38,348 --> 01:13:42,524
This life is temporary.

935
01:13:42,585 --> 01:13:46,863
Just as Christ was raised
from the dead into life,

936
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:51,133
<i>I, and all
who believe in him,</i>

937
01:13:51,194 --> 01:13:54,198
will be raised
from the dead.

938
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:58,575
<i>Don't forget,
I saw the risen Christ.</i>

939
01:13:58,635 --> 01:13:59,909
I know he died.

940
01:13:59,969 --> 01:14:03,610
I saw the empty tom b.

941
01:14:03,673 --> 01:14:07,246
<i>But more than this,</i>

942
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:11,452
I saw the risen Lord.

943
01:14:11,514 --> 01:14:14,222
I walked with him,

944
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:17,890
and talked with him,

945
01:14:17,954 --> 01:14:21,527
and ate with him.

946
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:30,770
<i>I must think on this.</i>

947
01:14:30,833 --> 01:14:34,804
I must speak
to my wife.

948
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:57,766
My love,
what news?

949
01:14:57,827 --> 01:14:59,135
What?

950
01:14:59,195 --> 01:15:00,868
Have you gone mad?

951
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:02,432
You haven't left
this spot.

952
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:03,772
You must go home.

953
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:05,176
You've been here
the entire night!

954
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:07,305
I wait to hear
Simon Peter's answer.

955
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:09,782
Why did you make me
ask that question?

956
01:15:09,839 --> 01:15:11,216
You are a man grown.

957
01:15:11,274 --> 01:15:12,548
You may do
as you wish.

958
01:15:12,608 --> 01:15:17,114
You make threats
I can't ignore.

959
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:20,218
No, I was
as curious as you.

960
01:15:20,283 --> 01:15:24,231
I've gone too far,
and now I am unsure.

961
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:26,198
Unsure? Of what?

962
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:27,825
Everything.

963
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:33,033
The gods, the world,
the afterlife, myself.

964
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:35,075
And I will not endanger you
by accepting this faith.

965
01:15:35,131 --> 01:15:36,405
Martinian-

966
01:15:36,466 --> 01:15:38,309
No, you are
my wife.

967
01:15:38,368 --> 01:15:39,642
I am your husband.

968
01:15:39,702 --> 01:15:41,306
Martinian- It is my
duty to protect you!

969
01:15:41,371 --> 01:15:42,645
I am putting
my foot down.

970
01:15:42,705 --> 01:15:44,207
We will hear no more
of these Christians.

971
01:15:44,273 --> 01:15:48,244
My love, I am already
a Christian.

972
01:15:51,113 --> 01:15:53,354
H ow?

973
01:15:53,416 --> 01:15:56,363
How did this happen?

974
01:15:56,419 --> 01:16:00,697
There was a slave
who told me of Jesus,

975
01:16:00,757 --> 01:16:05,206
a girl from the market,

976
01:16:05,261 --> 01:16:08,003
told me
the words of Christ.

977
01:16:08,064 --> 01:16:13,742
I met her in secret,
and we talked many times.

978
01:16:13,803 --> 01:16:15,840
When she took ill,
I tended her death bed.

979
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:18,545
My love, she-

980
01:16:18,608 --> 01:16:23,182
she had no fear
of dying.

981
01:16:23,246 --> 01:16:29,720
<i>She had a peace
that was indescribable.</i>

982
01:16:29,785 --> 01:16:32,789
<i>She was meek,
gentle, kind.</i>

983
01:16:32,855 --> 01:16:36,962
<i>She was the least,
and she shall stand ﬁrst</i>

984
01:16:37,026 --> 01:16:40,371
<i>next to Christ
in heaven.</i>

985
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:44,536
<i>When death took her,
she smiled,</i>

986
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:51,245
<i>as if she could
already see his face.</i>

987
01:16:51,307 --> 01:16:53,548
I have that same
peace, Martinian.

988
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:59,389
If I were to die tomorrow,
I have such rest in my heart.

989
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:04,761
My beloved Martinian, do you
not desire to have that same-

990
01:17:04,821 --> 01:17:08,268
that same rest
in your heart?

991
01:17:08,324 --> 01:17:09,928
Call to Jesus
in prayer.

992
01:17:09,992 --> 01:17:11,266
Ask him to
forgive your sins.

993
01:17:11,327 --> 01:17:17,005
Ask him to be your Savior
from sin and punishment.

994
01:17:17,066 --> 01:17:19,068
I do not believe
my ears.

995
01:17:19,135 --> 01:17:22,947
I am married
to an outlaw!

996
01:17:23,005 --> 01:17:26,145
Do you love me?

997
01:17:26,209 --> 01:17:30,180
You know I do
with all my heart.

998
01:17:30,246 --> 01:17:35,025
Then you must choose,
for my path is with Christ.

999
01:17:35,084 --> 01:17:38,258
Where does
your path lead?

1000
01:17:38,321 --> 01:17:39,595
I don't know.

1001
01:17:39,655 --> 01:17:43,034
You have taken counsel
with Simon Peter himself.

1002
01:17:43,092 --> 01:17:46,596
You have heard
the truth from his lips.

1003
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:52,203
What more do you
need to hear?

1004
01:17:54,537 --> 01:17:57,143
Nothing.

1005
01:17:57,206 --> 01:18:02,280
I need nothing more.

1006
01:18:02,344 --> 01:18:06,952
Do you still
seek his blessing?

1007
01:18:07,016 --> 01:18:08,996
Wait here.

1008
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:21,701
<i>Time's up, ﬁsherman.</i>

1009
01:18:21,764 --> 01:18:24,540
<i>Third day breaks.</i>

1010
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:29,049
<i>You are mine.</i>

1011
01:18:29,105 --> 01:18:32,052
I fear no evil.

1012
01:18:32,108 --> 01:18:35,317
Christ has victory
over you.

1013
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:44,687
My fate is
sealed by Christ.

1014
01:18:56,566 --> 01:19:00,446
I just have one
last question.

1015
01:19:00,503 --> 01:19:04,212
<i>Where did you find the strength
to become the man that you are,</i>

1016
01:19:04,273 --> 01:19:08,016
from an ordinary fisherman
to a great apostle?

1017
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:12,355
<i>People line up just so that
your shadow might fall on them.</i>

1018
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:14,621
<i>What caused
this transformation?</i>

1019
01:19:14,684 --> 01:19:18,894
It was all God.

1020
01:19:18,955 --> 01:19:21,868
<i>Jesus chose me.</i>

1021
01:19:21,924 --> 01:19:25,701
He walked with me
and taught me.

1022
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:31,768
He gave me the
Holy Spirit to guide me,

1023
01:19:31,834 --> 01:19:36,806
<i>and God has a plan
for you, too.</i>

1024
01:19:41,877 --> 01:19:44,551
The wager is yours,
Simon Peter.

1025
01:19:44,614 --> 01:19:46,423
<i>You have won.</i>

1026
01:19:46,482 --> 01:19:48,393
<i>I have decided.</i>

1027
01:19:48,451 --> 01:19:51,728
I will stand with you
and as Christ is my Lord.

1028
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:53,494
Now come, I will
take you out of here

1029
01:19:53,556 --> 01:19:56,594
before the shift changes.

1030
01:19:56,659 --> 01:20:00,607
Jesus Christ
welcomes you

1031
01:20:00,663 --> 01:20:05,271
with honor and love,
Martinian,

1032
01:20:05,334 --> 01:20:07,905
but I cannot
go with you.

1033
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:10,450
<i>That would only
endanger you.</i>

1034
01:20:10,506 --> 01:20:11,917
I will die.

1035
01:20:11,974 --> 01:20:13,248
Oh, cursed on that.

1036
01:20:13,309 --> 01:20:15,653
I thought you
would say that.

1037
01:20:15,711 --> 01:20:17,190
Hold on.

1038
01:20:36,165 --> 01:20:37,439
What have you done?

1039
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:38,774
You would not
come to her.

1040
01:20:38,834 --> 01:20:40,711
What else
was I to do?

1041
01:20:40,770 --> 01:20:43,273
This is dangerous.

1042
01:20:43,339 --> 01:20:46,650
<i>Simon Peter,
apostle of Christ,</i>

1043
01:20:46,709 --> 01:20:51,681
I beg you,
give me your blessing.

1044
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:59,056
<i>Novella, is your
life given over to Jesus?</i>

1045
01:20:59,121 --> 01:21:04,161
<i>Do you claim him to be
your Lord and salvation?</i>

1046
01:21:04,226 --> 01:21:06,228
<i>Yes.</i>

1047
01:21:06,295 --> 01:21:10,903
Then you shall
be blessed as you desire.

1048
01:21:10,966 --> 01:21:15,415
<i>Accept this blessing in the
glorious name of the Father,</i>

1049
01:21:15,471 --> 01:21:18,315
His Son Jesus Christ,

1050
01:21:18,374 --> 01:21:19,682
and the Holy-

1051
01:21:20,710 --> 01:21:23,691
<i>Processus.</i>

1052
01:21:24,547 --> 01:21:25,992
<i>Processus,
what are you doing?</i>

1053
01:21:26,048 --> 01:21:27,322
Do you like
persecution so much

1054
01:21:27,383 --> 01:21:28,987
that you want
to partake of it?

1055
01:21:29,051 --> 01:21:30,997
You heard his words,
as well as I.

1056
01:21:31,053 --> 01:21:35,160
Did you not hear
the truth in them?

1057
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:37,761
They were just stories.

1058
01:21:37,826 --> 01:21:40,500
What of Christ,
the man himself?

1059
01:21:40,563 --> 01:21:43,100
His words, his followers are
spreading across the land,

1060
01:21:43,165 --> 01:21:44,940
fulfilling prophecies,
performing miracles,

1061
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,173
risen from the dead,
that is no story!

1062
01:21:47,236 --> 01:21:49,011
He was a rebel,
and his followers are outlaws!

1063
01:21:49,071 --> 01:21:50,607
That is what
the emperor says.

1064
01:21:50,673 --> 01:21:52,380
What do you think?

1065
01:21:52,441 --> 01:21:55,388
Am I an outlaw?
My wife?

1066
01:21:55,444 --> 01:21:56,787
Would you see us
tortured and killed?

1067
01:21:56,845 --> 01:21:58,449
<i>You're asking
me to disobey my command!</i>

1068
01:21:58,514 --> 01:22:00,687
I'm asking you
to think for your soul,

1069
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:02,251
the part of you that
will live forever.

1070
01:22:02,318 --> 01:22:03,592
Stop confusing me!

1071
01:22:03,652 --> 01:22:05,723
Let go of your anger,
your distrust.

1072
01:22:05,788 --> 01:22:08,268
How dare you
talk down to me.

1073
01:22:08,324 --> 01:22:09,598
I am arresting you!

1074
01:22:09,658 --> 01:22:11,262
Let him into
your heart.

1075
01:22:11,327 --> 01:22:12,601
Shut your mouth!

1076
01:22:12,661 --> 01:22:13,935
Save yourself!

1077
01:22:13,996 --> 01:22:15,304
I said shut up!

1078
01:22:15,598 --> 01:22:16,906
Martinian!

1079
01:22:22,204 --> 01:22:23,547
Strike me
all you want.

1080
01:22:23,606 --> 01:22:25,142
I am your friend
and I love you.

1081
01:22:25,207 --> 01:22:27,278
Christ our Lord
loves you.

1082
01:22:48,731 --> 01:22:52,508
Come Process us.

1083
01:22:52,568 --> 01:22:59,247
Receive Jesus as your Savior
and be free of all your sins.

1084
01:23:24,166 --> 01:23:30,981
God the Father,
you have given us salvation.

1085
01:23:31,040 --> 01:23:36,046
Touch these hearts,
as today they recognize

1086
01:23:36,111 --> 01:23:39,285
their need for you,

1087
01:23:39,348 --> 01:23:43,728
<i>and they wish to accept
Jesus as Lord.</i>

1088
01:23:43,786 --> 01:23:45,629
Processus,

1089
01:23:45,688 --> 01:23:48,168
<i>Martinfan,</i>

1090
01:23:48,224 --> 01:23:52,001
<i>pray with me.</i>

1091
01:23:52,061 --> 01:23:56,009
<i>"Lord, I accept
Jesus as my Savior,</i>

1092
01:23:56,065 --> 01:24:02,209
<i>and I thank you
for the forgiveness of sin. "</i>

1093
01:24:02,271 --> 01:24:07,220
<i>Lord,
I accept Jesus as my Savior,</i>

1094
01:24:07,276 --> 01:24:10,849
<i>and I thank you
for the forgiveness of sin.</i>

1095
01:24:11,947 --> 01:24:14,587
<i>Amen.</i>

1096
01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:16,129
Amen.

1097
01:24:19,388 --> 01:24:21,368
Amen.

1098
01:24:22,658 --> 01:24:27,630
Novella, you seek
the blessing of Christ.

1099
01:24:33,435 --> 01:24:35,073
May I ask?

1100
01:24:35,137 --> 01:24:39,552
We are without child.

1101
01:24:39,608 --> 01:24:45,354
"I will withhold no good
thing from those who love me,

1102
01:24:45,414 --> 01:24:49,521
says the Lord.

1103
01:24:49,585 --> 01:24:52,259
Go in peace.

1104
01:24:52,321 --> 01:24:54,597
<i>Thank you.</i>

1105
01:25:11,807 --> 01:25:13,548
<i>How many times
have I told the guards?</i>

1106
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:17,216
<i>Political prisoners on the left,
religious fanatics on the right.</i>

1107
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:20,385
Do I have to do everything
myself around here?

1108
01:25:20,449 --> 01:25:23,658
You two,
where's your prisoner?

1109
01:25:23,719 --> 01:25:26,563
It is past dawn,
you great louts.

1110
01:25:26,622 --> 01:25:28,226
He is to be crucified.

1111
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:29,564
Bind him and take him.

1112
01:25:29,625 --> 01:25:32,071
We need the cell for another.
Who is it?

1113
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:35,597
Sir, another
Christian, Saul of Tarsus.

1114
01:25:35,664 --> 01:25:36,938
They're crawling
out of the walls,

1115
01:25:36,999 --> 01:25:40,606
these Christians!

1116
01:25:52,314 --> 01:25:56,558
This is gonna be the hardest
thing I've ever done.

1117
01:26:17,206 --> 01:26:19,686
Is it time?

1118
01:26:19,741 --> 01:26:21,652
It's time,
Simon Peter.

1119
01:26:21,710 --> 01:26:24,520
The cell is required
for another Christian prisoner,

1120
01:26:24,580 --> 01:26:27,891
a certain
Saul of Tars us.

1121
01:26:27,950 --> 01:26:31,921
Paul, my old friend.

1122
01:26:35,757 --> 01:26:38,135
Teacher,
I cannot do this.

1123
01:26:38,193 --> 01:26:39,467
I cannot do this.

1124
01:26:39,528 --> 01:26:41,838
For all that you've done for
the sake of Christ our Lord,

1125
01:26:41,897 --> 01:26:43,672
let us escort you
to safety.

1126
01:26:43,732 --> 01:26:45,507
<i>My dear Maninian,</i>

1127
01:26:45,567 --> 01:26:49,640
that is exactly
where I'm going.

1128
01:26:49,705 --> 01:26:52,652
<i>What! told you
in the darkness,</i>

1129
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:56,815
speak in the light.

1130
01:26:56,878 --> 01:27:01,190
What I whispered
in your ear,

1131
01:27:01,250 --> 01:27:06,222
proclaim from
the rooftops.

1132
01:27:08,290 --> 01:27:10,270
We must go.

1133
01:27:17,266 --> 01:27:20,247
Then take me to Jesus

1134
01:27:20,302 --> 01:27:23,283
<i>and be quick about it.</i>

1135
01:27:23,338 --> 01:27:27,787
I can't bear to be away
from him a moment longer.

1136
01:27:41,857 --> 01:27:45,430
<i>Peace, I leave you.</i>

1137
01:27:45,494 --> 01:27:49,442
<i>My peace I give you;</i>

1138
01:27:49,498 --> 01:27:51,068
<i>not as the world
gives peace,</i>

1139
01:27:51,133 --> 01:27:55,946
<i>for in this world
you will have many troubles.</i>

1140
01:27:56,004 --> 01:27:58,211
<i>But take heart,</i>

1141
01:27:58,273 --> 01:28:02,221
<i>for! have
overcome this world.</i>

1142
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:05,884
<i>I am the way.</i>

1143
01:28:05,948 --> 01:28:08,724
<i>I am the truth.</i>

1144
01:28:08,784 --> 01:28:13,255
<i>I am the life.</i>

1145
01:28:13,321 --> 01:28:18,930
<i>No one comes to the Father,
except through me.</i>

1146
01:28:18,994 --> 01:28:22,498
<i>Everyone who asks
will receive.</i>

1147
01:28:22,564 --> 01:28:24,100
<i>He who seeks will ﬁnd,</i>

1148
01:28:24,166 --> 01:28:29,411
<i>and to him who knocks
the door will be opened.</i>

1149
01:28:29,471 --> 01:28:32,850
Do not let your hearts
be troubled.

1150
01:28:32,908 --> 01:28:36,481
Do not be afraid.

1151
01:28:36,545 --> 01:28:41,255
Remain in my love.

1152
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:47,289
Again I say,
remain in my love;

1153
01:28:48,357 --> 01:28:54,672
and surely,
I am with you always

1154
01:28:54,729 --> 01:28:58,700
to the very end
of the age.

1155
01:28:59,580 --> 01:30:50,360
