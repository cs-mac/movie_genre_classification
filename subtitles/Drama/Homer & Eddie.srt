Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:12:57,845 --> 00:13:00,075
See, this car goes
anywhere I want it to go.

171
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,310
I just get behind
the wheel and it goes.

172
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:03,754
Take you to Oregon,
we'll find these guys,

173

and we'll get my $87
back, huh?

174

Yeah. I haven't

So what do you do
for work?

178
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:25,206

179
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,235
Yeah.
Oh, really?

Right by my house.

in your pocket there.

No. They got that
malted milk stuff
and that caramel in it.

Homer like you hit

You know, I've had pizza
from all around the world,

243
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:37,244
but I think I like
Arizona pizza the best.

244
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:38,437
Absolutely the best.

245
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:41,238
You know, this is really
a nice restaurant, Eddie.

246
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:42,341
You sure you can afford this?

247
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,442
Oh, yeah. I figured
it was the least I could do

248
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:46,084
since I bashed your fuckin'
head into the car.

249
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:49,179
Oh, that's ok.
I've been--I've been hit
a lot worse than that.

250
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,582
I was hit with a baseball
one time.

251

Oh.

252

Yeah. That's why
I'm the way I am.

They all say that.

258
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,695
It's because
when the ball hit me,

259
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:08,337
it knocked my brainstems
loose or something like that.

260

is a brainstem?

even heard of it.

up to the top

wants to fall down
into your neck.

been the same since.

271
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,164
Well, so what happened?

272

Well, they tell me

273

third base, right?

no attention, I guess--

whacked the ball
real hard

00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,400
and I got beaned
right in my ear.

Get outta here.

328
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:37,749
Yeah. The bank
turned me down.

329
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,290
Yeah.
Really?

330
00:18:39,386 --> 00:18:40,416
Well, you know,
you ain't a man

331
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,450
till you got
a credit card.

332
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:43,094
I don't know what
I would do without mine.

333
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,430
Well, I'm not gonna
go back there

334
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:47,255
and ask 'em for yours.

335
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,630
Nosirree.

00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:49,758
Ha ha ha ha ha!

337
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:52,132
Well, shit,
it's the computer's
fault, anyway.

338
00:18:52,232 --> 00:18:53,472
I mean, the computer
is the worst--

339
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:56,236
I don't know,
it's the worst thing
ever created.

340
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:57,236
Yeah.

341
00:18:57,337 --> 00:18:58,507
I mean, it's worse
that the clap.

342
00:18:58,605 --> 00:19:00,765
It's worse than cops.
It's damn near as bad
as shrinks, man,

343
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,113
[belches]
I'm telling you.

344
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,310
Damn, homer.

[Belches]

346
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:08,778
Yeah, well, how come
you hit me back there, Eddie?

347
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:09,781
Huh?

348
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:10,852
How come you hit me
back there?

349
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,190
I mean...

I don't know.
I don't know.

351
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,650
I just--i felt
like it, I guess.

352
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:16,524
I--i know, but don't
do that no more, ok?

353
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:18,193
'Cause it really hurts
like the dickens.

354
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:21,831
Well, homer, I mean,
I can't make any promises.

355
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:22,828
God.

356
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:24,729
I thought we was friends.

357
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:27,531
Friends? No, man,
I'm just using you

358
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:29,804
to get my $87 back.

359
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,272
Well...

360
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:33,241
Well, don't do it no more,
anyway, ok?

361
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,310
'Cause I just can't
take a punch like I used to

362
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:38,679
when I was
in the golden gloves.

363
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:41,208
You were never
in no golden--

Golden gloves.
No!

366
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:46,146
No, I knocked out
about 600 guys.

367
00:19:46,253 --> 00:19:47,153
[Laughing]

368
00:19:47,254 --> 00:19:48,224
Yes.

369
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:51,191
Yeah, I only lost one fight
in my whole career.

370
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,161
And I got screwed on that one.

371
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,160
You are so full of--

372
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:55,431
no, I was in Guatemala
and those...

373
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,368
I should've never
went down there.
The refs were murder.

374
00:19:58,465 --> 00:20:00,165
Eddie: You are so full of shit.

375
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:01,527
You go down
to the hall of records

376
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:03,674
and you look it up
and it's there.

377
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,940
[Continues indistinct]

378
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:33,372
Homer.

379
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:36,696
Come on, where the fuck
are you? Huh? Huh?

380
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:39,013
God damn it.

381
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:44,484
I packed an extra toothbrush.

382
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:47,877
So, I'll let you borrow mine
if you promise

383
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,280
that you'll wash it off
real good.

384
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:52,394
Fuck that.

385
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:53,385
All right.

386
00:20:53,486 --> 00:20:55,216
But you don't want
all that plaque and tarter

387
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:56,362
to build up on your choppers.

388
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:58,756
My dentist says
that once you get it on there,

389
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:00,888
it takes a blowtorch
to get it off.

390
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:04,463
Is that all you
think about is plaque
and fuckin' tarter?

00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:08,544
Well, in the morning
and after meals, yes.

00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,842
Do you know
what's out there?

393
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:13,608
Besides your car?

394
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:15,336
There are lawyers,

395
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:16,912
there are shrinks,

396
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:19,349
there are nuns!

00:21:27,354 --> 00:21:28,254
What?

400
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:29,685
It's the big one.

[Rumbling gets louder]

It's an earthquake.

403

I don't think I can get
this brush clean.

That wasn't it.

408
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,440
That wasn't it.

409
00:21:49,542 --> 00:21:50,582
Where was I?

410
00:21:50,677 --> 00:21:53,947
You was talkin' about
murderers, rapists, and lawyers.

411
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:54,946
Yes.

412

There's--there's lawyers...

There's people out there
starving.

They don't have anyplace to go.
There's no food for them.

419

And there's hurricanes
and there's all kinds
of weather

and there's pestilence.
God made pestilence.

And that's what
he put down on people.
He made pestilence.

And he made diseases.

There's diseases that
they don't even have a cure for.

It doesn't even matter
how much rich--
how much rich you are,

425

and it doesn't matter to them
because they can't cure it.

426

It doesn't matter what you do.
They don't have the money
to cure it.

once at the indy 500.

Homer, you never
drove no indy car.

859
00:41:32,624 --> 00:41:37,204
Yes, I did. In 1976, I had
lapped Mario andretti 3 times.

00:41:37,295 --> 00:41:39,525
And a.J. Foyt,
well, he cracked into me.

00:41:39,631 --> 00:41:42,731
And his car went over the wall
and killed 200 racing fans.

So, I can't--
homer, let go

giving me a headache
with your bullshit.

You can look it up
in the hall of records.

Yeah.
I mean, I picked them

898

of my eyes.

before, Eddie.

Not even when
you were a kid?

Especially when
I was a kid.

972
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:49,327
What about your folks?
Didn't they like you?

973
00:47:49,434 --> 00:47:50,874
Oh, yeah. Sure.

974
00:47:50,969 --> 00:47:53,499
You know, when I got
my brain stems crunched

975
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:55,044
by that baseball?
Uh-huh.

976
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:57,240
Well, they sent me
all the way across
the country,

977
00:47:57,342 --> 00:48:01,252
just so I can get
the best care possible.

978

979
00:48:02,981 --> 00:48:04,621
Oh, yeah. Well,
they brought me back

980
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:07,485

for Christmas, you know.

But then my dad,
his business went sour.

983
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:14,092
And so, instead of spending
the money on plane tickets,

984
00:48:14,192 --> 00:48:17,602
they said I should stay
in the hospital at cedar crest.

they didn't want you?

No. Oh, no.

So, when was
the last time you saw them?

996
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:48,533

really went sour.

I mean, they send me
money sometimes,

1001
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:02,370
but I don't really
cash the check,
because his business

1002
00:49:02,473 --> 00:49:05,613
is still
really, really sour.
