1
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,158
Somebody's coming, Ben.

2
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,355
Yeah, how many?

3
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,351
Don't know, couldn't tell.

4
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,548
Just one.

5
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,318
I think i know him.

6
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,679
Hello, J.D.

7
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,915
Ben.

8
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,273
How've you been?

9
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,429
So-so.

10
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,429
You?

11
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,473
Can't complain.

12
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,916
You with them, Lightfoot,
or just passing through?

13
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,230
If i told you once, J.D.,
I've told you a dozen times.

14
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,152
My name is Chief Lightfoot.

15
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,038
And i'm a bona fide war chief
of the Comanche nation.

16
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,793
- And you and l...
- You didn't answer my question.

17
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,359
I'll make it plain.

18
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,556
Do i have to shoot you or not?

19
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,676
Stopped by for a cup of coffee.

20
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,599
Very good cup.

21
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,511
You figure i owe you anything, Ben?

22
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,669
Nope.

23
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,878
I got a warrant for the three of you and...

24
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,553
Pee Wee Simser.

25
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,756
- That's you over at the left, Pee Wee?
- That's right, J.D.

26
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,319
That's me.

27
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,190
And Joe Meehan,i see you.

28
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,436
Any of you want to surrender?

29
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,873
Now, what did you say?

30
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,554
I said, "Any of you want to surrender?"

31
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,191
Five of us and one of you?

32
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,875
I'll say one thing for you, J.D.

33
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,038
You got style.

34
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,390
Yes, sir, you got style.

35
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,032
Oh, no, you ain't.

36
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,599
You ain't gonna get me today,
you dirty, beady-eyed little sons.

37
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,229
Little Pee Wee ain't gonna die today,
you filthy scavengers.

38
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,151
Oh, shut up, Simser.

39
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,438
Buzzard bites you,
he'd never eat meat again.

40
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,155
J.D.?

41
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,518
I can hear. You don't have to shout.
What do you want?

42
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,717
J.D., i'm suffering the tortures
of the damned back here.

43
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,793
- Now, my leg is killing me. Can't we just...
- Don't start crybabying, Pee Wee.

44
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,792
I know the sound
of that old Spencer of yours.

45
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,277
You put a slug in the meaty part
of my left shoulder.

46
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:13,591
You knowed damn well
I've been shot there twice before.

47
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,268
You knowed.

48
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,639
Damn it, J.D.

49
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,073
These things is too tight.

50
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,277
There ain't no reason to chain us up
like a bunch of dogs.

51
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,395
Meehan!

52
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,758
Dad-blast it, J.D.

53
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,593
You ain't gonna sleep
with that Greener on cock, are you?

54
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,079
That's right.

55
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,279
If you even twitch your finger by accident,
you could blow our heads off.

56
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,999
If you call the tune, you pay the piper.

57
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,229
Meaning, if you don't like the treatment...

58
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,038
don't rob the banks.

59
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,954
Billy Joe!

60
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,832
Billy Joe Cahill!

61
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,119
Coming, Denver!

62
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,918
Make it mighty damn pronto.

63
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,911
It's time you was in bed.

64
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,479
There you are.

65
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,229
I don't know
what's got into you boys lately.

66
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,114
This morning i sent your brother
into town with Struther...

67
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,272
and he ain't back yet.
Now i can't get you to go to bed.

68
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,510
- I'm going.
- Damn right you are.

69
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,313
This is the last trip that Danny makes
with that Struther.

70
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,709
I told your pa it was a mistake to hire him.

71
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,631
Would the marshal listen to me? No.

72
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,632
He rides off and leaves me
with everything to worry about.

73
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,835
Denver?

74
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,991
I'm awful tired. Can i go to bed now?

75
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,116
Sooner the better. Get plenty of rest...

76
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,158
cause we got a lot of darn work
to do tomorrow.

77
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,157
All right, the plates.

78
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,553
Whoa, boy.

79
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,468
Giddyup!

80
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,918
Get out of here.

81
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,998
That's all right.

82
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,154
Mr. Grady.

83
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,675
Can you spare one of them cigars?

84
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,669
Pay you back as soon as I get out.

85
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,672
How old are you, boy?

86
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,113
Seventeen...

87
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,159
going on 18.

88
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,358
Is that right, Struther?

89
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,158
He was 17 last week.

90
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,879
But he's a man full-grown, if you ask me.

91
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,510
And capable of making up
his own mind about...

92
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,272
cigars or whatever.

93
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,759
Ain't that right, Danny?

94
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,558
Yes, sir, you betcha.

95
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,037
His old man is gonna kick you
from here to California...

96
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,112
when he finds out how you've been
watching out over his boy.

97
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,714
I told you he was a man.
We're friends, is all.

98
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,552
I ain't watching over him.

99
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,153
Well, you should be.

100
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,312
I knew J.D. was wrong
when he took custody of you.

101
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,877
Promised the judge
you'd never use that knife again.

102
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,918
- You're nothing but a two-bit little...
- Sheriff?

103
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,315
Jimmy Kane's bringing in Charlie Smith,
and drunk as usual.

104
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,231
What's wrong, Charlie?
You're not due here till Thursday next.

105
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,753
I don't know.

106
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,873
Sheriff, the Devil called...

107
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,512
And i come running.

108
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,637
Fire in the Simpson stable, Sheriff!

109
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,598
- God Almighty. That place will go up...
- I'm coming, Sheriff!

110
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,955
No, you're not.
You'd fall asleep and get roasted.

111
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,951
Now get in your cell!

112
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,559
Fire!

113
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,271
Sure get excited about...

114
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,793
a little fire.

115
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,751
That's what we've heard.

116
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,836
Come on, she's burning fast!

117
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,273
Pull harder!

118
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,513
All right. Get her moving.

119
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,111
Don't i know you, boy?

120
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,431
Danny Cahill, Mr. Smith.

121
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,313
J.D. 's boy?

122
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,268
Yes, sir.

123
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,309
I don't want to be inquisitive...

124
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,710
but what are you in here for?

125
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,272
Drunk and disorderly.

126
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,110
I heard about it. Yeah.

127
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,150
You busted up the Liberty Saloon
real good.

128
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,235
Did $37 damage.

129
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,109
Your pa's knowed around some, ain't he?

130
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,358
I reckon he's been knowed around
a few campfires and public hangings.

131
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,633
That old worn-out drunk
sure puts rust on the blade for us.

132
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,790
He could swallow his tongue.

133
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,789
What?

134
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,632
A lot of boozers I've knowed...

135
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,518
just kinda swallowed their tongue
and never woke up.

136
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,279
I can put a pillow over the dog's head
and smother him.

137
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,474
Fraser!

138
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,469
What you talking about?

139
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,755
We said nobody would get hurt,
and nobody is.

140
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,230
That old coot ain't even gonna wake up
until outhouse call in the morning.

141
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,992
Yeah, that's right.

142
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:54,832
Danny, it's gonna take more than
old Charlie there to mess up our plans.

143
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,553
Give them to me.

144
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,519
Denver's madder than hell, Danny.

145
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,353
I'm thinking we oughta change our minds
while we still can.

146
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,750
Now, Billy Joe,
that just ain't no Christian attitude...

147
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,471
That's your privilege.

148
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,716
Plain fact is that you're both...

149
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,915
young.

150
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,629
If you're gonna go backwatering on me,
I ain't going to hold it against you.

151
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,597
He's flimflamming us, Danny.

152
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,319
He thinks that being young
is the same as being stupid.

153
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,038
You go whichever way you want...

154
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,192
but that barn out there
ain't gonna burn forever.

155
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,676
Give him the keys, Billy Joe.

156
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,036
Kinda hate to set ourselves against Pa.

157
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,189
Pa?

158
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,716
That cranky old cowhand Denver
has been more of a pa to you than J.D.

159
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,711
Ain't that right, Danny?

160
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,356
The hell with J.D. Cahill.

161
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,559
Let's go rob ourselves a bank, Billy Joe.

162
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,872
Give me the keys.

163
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,588
Struther!

164
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,799
Come on!

165
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,835
Move it. Watch what you're doing!

166
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,831
Move that bucket.

167
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,033
Pump faster!

168
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,834
Get that water on the roof!

169
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,953
Now get at it!

170
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,473
All right, move.

171
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,273
Throw the water!

172
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,916
Come on. Get it over where the fire is!
A little bit lower.

173
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,632
Keep pumping there!

174
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,148
Sheriff!

175
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,153
Come on, now!

176
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,912
- The bank's being robbed.
- What?

177
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,560
The bank's being robbed.

178
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,868
Sheriff!

179
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,397
Gordine, stay on the fire. Jim, the bank.

180
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,592
Get on the pumps. Go!

181
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,670
All right, pour it on there!

182
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,995
Get water on that roof there!

183
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,873
- Remember, nobody's to get hurt!
- Get back.

184
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,234
Sheriff!

185
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,433
Sheriff Grady.

186
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,354
Come on.

187
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,194
Oh, Danny.

188
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,109
All right.

189
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,799
Get on inside.

190
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,628
Not you!

191
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,512
Now, where's that boy?

192
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,472
I seen it, Danny.

193
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,198
I seen them both killed.

194
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,475
There's nothing i could do. I tried.

195
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,835
- Boy, you listen to me!
- Hey!

196
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,750
You do what you're supposed to do.

197
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,832
You hide that money just like we agreed,
and you just wait.

198
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,195
That's all you do. You just wait...

199
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,795
if you ever want to see your big brother
alive again. Do you understand me?

200
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,711
- You understand me?
- Yes, sir.

201
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,711
And you, you listen, too.

202
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,194
You betray us...

203
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,955
You betray us even with a look,
and as sure as there's a Devil in Hell...

204
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,952
either me, or Brownie, or Struther,
or one of our friends...

205
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,873
of which there are many, will kill that boy.

206
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,311
We know what to do with betrayers...

207
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,356
and we'll kill him for sure.

208
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,833
You hear me?

209
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,949
Say it!

210
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,714
I hear!

211
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,359
Now get inside!

212
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,153
- Marshal.
- Albert.

213
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,879
- I sure am glad you're back.
- I'm glad to be back.

214
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,999
There's three more of them in there.
One of them needs Dr. Jones real bad.

215
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,680
I'd appreciate it if you'd see to him
and the horses.

216
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,593
- Yes, sir. Marshal, I wanted to...
- And Tom Howard.

217
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,672
- The undertaker?
- I got a couple of customers for him, too.

218
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,239
But, Marshal, i wanted to...

219
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,629
Tell that old bandit not to get extravagant.

220
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,631
The State of Texas is paying for this.

221
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,153
Yes, but, Marshal...

222
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,515
Albert, have you heard one word i've said?

223
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,114
Yes, but I wanted to tell you
about Sheriff Grady.

224
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,919
- Tell me later.
- But you haven't...

225
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,752
It's the marshal.

226
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,629
Hank?

227
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,232
No way to run a jail.

228
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,749
Be my guest.

229
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,877
- J.D., these handcuffs...
- Get used to them.

230
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,959
Charlie...

231
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,394
what are you doing in here?
It ain't Thursday.

232
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,074
A man's got a right to change his mind.

233
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,754
Besides, it's gonna rain on Thursday.

234
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,751
Now, drinking in the rain...

235
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,750
it's bad for your health.

236
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,073
It's getting so a man
can't get a decent night's sleep...

237
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,196
without some marshal...

238
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,989
All right, Struther, you can come out
from under that Stetson.

239
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,433
What is it this time?

240
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,795
Hope you haven't been stealing
any more horses...

241
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,394
No, J.D., i'm hung over something terrible.

242
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,436
I can't hardly remember a thing.

243
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,919
You can't...

244
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,434
Daniel?

245
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,669
Daniel.

246
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,835
What the hell is he doing in here?

247
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,117
- Drunk and disorderly.
- Yeah! Drinking and fighting.

248
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,074
With them.

249
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,639
Looks like you were kind of overmatched.

250
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,671
It was a friendly fight.

251
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,270
I've never been in one of them.

252
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,915
What are you doing in town, you...

253
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,798
Come here.

254
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,031
All right. I know where you are.

255
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,872
Where's your kid brother?

256
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,313
He's around.

257
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,509
Around?

258
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,511
Isn't he going to school?

259
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,796
- Sometimes.
- Sometimes?

260
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,429
How's he gonna get a proper education
going to school "sometimes"?

261
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,830
Instead of raising Ned, you ought
to be raising that brother of yours.

262
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,639
Ain't you got no sense of responsibility?

263
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,076
Your mother, God rest her soul...

264
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,674
seen to it you could read and write...

265
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,512
could do your ciphers proper.

266
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,239
The least you could do
is the same for your kid brother.

267
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,309
Why?

268
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,435
Why?

269
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,599
I ain't his pa.

270
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,676
Yeah.

271
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,197
Marshal, you should have seen...

272
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,679
You're fired.

273
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,119
Billy Joe.

274
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,958
Where you going?

275
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,239
Come here.

276
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,753
Hello, Budger.

277
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,674
Hello, Pa.

278
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,437
You're bleeding again.

279
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,309
Yeah.

280
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,914
Seems like every time you show up,
you been bleeding.

281
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,069
Yeah.

282
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,077
Only sometimes it's hard to remember
when the last time you showed up was.

283
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,470
I'll admit it's been a while.

284
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:42,875
J.D.

285
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,910
Hello, Hank. You have a good rest?

286
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,433
Where did you come from?

287
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,397
Where the hell is Grady?

288
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,230
What's the matter?
Did i say something wrong?

289
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,993
Come on, Hank, if Grady's drunk,
it won't be the first time.

290
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,556
Grady's been killed, J.D.

291
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,512
For the first time.

292
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,360
Marshal, good to see you, but I...

293
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,634
Any luck?

294
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,914
No, sir.

295
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,275
I brought you a couple of guests.

296
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:32,035
The sheriff from Dawson City
will pick them up in a day or so.

297
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,350
I'm awfully sorry about Sheriff Grady.
I know he was a friend of yours.

298
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,509
Yeah.

299
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,118
I'm not gonna...

300
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,959
mourn for him.

301
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,032
He lived a good life.

302
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,159
Guess there's no good way to die, so...

303
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,679
Tell me what happened.

304
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,113
Pretty sketchy.

305
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,875
All Kane said before he died was,
"Four men wearing yellow slickers."

306
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,229
Grady got shotgunned,
and I pulled a knife out of Jim Kane.

307
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,073
They broke in the back door of the bank
with sledgehammers.

308
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,151
We rode a 30-mile circumference...

309
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,515
with a 20-man posse,
including two Apaches.

310
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,715
No tracks.

311
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,792
That's impossible,
unless they're still in town.

312
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,950
No, sir, Mr. Cahill. No strangers.

313
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,270
Some local ranchers, some cowboys...

314
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,591
maybe not as sweet as scrubbed angels...

315
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,678
but in public view when it happened,
no strangers.

316
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,439
How about them?

317
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,670
They was in jail when it happened.

318
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,432
That right, Daniel?

319
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,433
That's right.

320
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,309
Pity.

321
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,430
Mr. Gordine,
when will you let us out of here?

322
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,829
Drunk and disorderly
is usually about 24 hours.

323
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,717
I guess now is a good a time as any.

324
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,075
I'm gonna make a little trip.
Take a day or two.

325
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,957
Will you hold them till I get back?

326
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,996
I can't do that, Marshal.

327
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,308
No cause.

328
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,189
Suit yourself.

329
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,474
Daniel.

330
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,149
- Yes, sir.
- Gonna deputize you.

331
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,389
No pay.

332
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,909
That figures.

333
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,877
Hold up your right hand.

334
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,637
Do you swear to uphold the law
of Baird, Texas...

335
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,278
United States of America?

336
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,357
And I ain't gonna forget
your taking care of Billy Joe, either.

337
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,193
He's a lot younger than my other boarders.

338
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,669
But it'll be nice to have
a young boy around again.

339
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,398
I sure appreciate it.

340
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,076
And if he stays, it'll be the first Cahill
I've been able to keep under my roof.

341
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,438
If he causes you any trouble,
you just sit right down on him.

342
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,919
And as for you, Billy Joe...

343
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,911
What the hell are you whispering about?

344
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,275
Don't you know
that whispering ain't polite...

345
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,590
except in church, or a courtroom?

346
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,517
What he's saying ain't private, Pa.

347
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,990
Billy Joe was thinking you ought
to let the doctor see your shoulder.

348
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,196
It's been took care of, bandaged, and...

349
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,635
- By whom, J.D.?
- By what?

350
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,755
Whom?

351
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,434
That's the correct way of asking
who done it.

352
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,748
I took care of it.

353
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,398
Purified it with whiskey.

354
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,755
Yeah, a quart and a half. He drunk it.

355
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,909
You're scared.

356
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,150
You're scared of Dr. Jones is what you are.

357
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,470
They say the last time
you was in his office...

358
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,120
they could hear you yelling
from Austin to El Paso.

359
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,156
- Get the horses.
- Billy Joe's right.

360
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,915
They say he's hit notes
music publishers ain't heard.

361
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,797
Get the horses, Daniel.

362
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,117
Austin to El Paso?

363
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,830
Thought I yelled louder than that.

364
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,989
Hetty.

365
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,394
Goodbye.

366
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,072
Come on. Let's go in.

367
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,639
Where are we going?

368
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,393
First we'll pick ourselves up a tracker.

369
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,153
That 'breed Comanche
over by the Goldicks' place?

370
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,959
The one thing i hate
more than a Comanche is half of one.

371
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,598
His name is Lightfoot.

372
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,592
I wouldn't call him 'breed to his face,
were i you.

373
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,035
Not if you want to reach maturity.

374
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,030
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

375
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:36,037
Didn't take that Struther long
to make new friends.

376
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,831
Papa, a stranger's coming.

377
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,394
I see him.

378
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,550
Good morning, my dear Chief.

379
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,194
I hope all goes well in your lives.

380
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,318
How about a cigar?

381
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:31,429
Chief?

382
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,669
Cigar?

383
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,676
What the hell do you want, J.D.?

384
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,113
I ain't got no money.

385
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,156
My horse is on his last legs.

386
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,630
And my genuine bearskin overcoat,
I lost in a crap game.

387
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,151
Need a tracker, Lightfoot.

388
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,713
That's better.

389
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,518
How long would you say?

390
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,397
Two days, maybe three.

391
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,155
It's...

392
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,196
cold up in them mountains.

393
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,479
That's a fact.

394
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,552
First day, $5.

395
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,551
$2 a day thereafter.

396
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,194
That's agreeable.

397
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,349
I'll track.

398
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,759
Any killing, you do it.

399
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,353
Might be friends of mine.

400
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,998
That's suitable.

401
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,509
Ma'am.

402
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,798
Morning, gentlemen.

403
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,474
Daniel.

404
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,990
I don't tip my hat to a squaw.

405
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,151
Ain't no squaw's gonna...

406
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,078
My apologies, ma'am.

407
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,708
Slight negligence in his upbringing.

408
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,955
Ma'am?

409
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,472
What you bringing us up here for?

410
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,754
Don't you know?

411
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,398
If i knowed i wouldn't ask.

412
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,311
What are you walking on?

413
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,039
Rock face.

414
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,031
That's right, rock face.

415
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:48,148
Starts back there out of Valentine,
climbs all the way up...

416
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,798
to Heaven, so the...

417
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,553
Comanches say.

418
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:55,114
Now, nobody just disappears, Daniel.

419
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:58,312
If the men that killed Ben Grady
ain't in town...

420
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,796
and didn't leave tracks
that two Apaches could read...

421
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,110
then they're up here somewhere.

422
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,430
And if they are, I'll find them.

423
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,233
Yes, sir, Daniel.

424
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,073
That's the truth you can bank on
in Denver.

425
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,192
If they're up here...

426
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,753
I'll find them.

427
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,359
Been smelling smoke.

428
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,078
Half a mile down the ridge.

429
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,388
How many?

430
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,551
Hired on as a tracker.

431
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,599
Stay here, Daniel.

432
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,272
I'll have a look.

433
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,317
Something on your mind?

434
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,958
Just thinking...

435
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:42,989
if you wasn't J.D. 's boy,
what a good time i'd have right now.

436
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,310
What I'd like to do to you
brings back fond memories.

437
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,430
I don't know what you're talking about.

438
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,112
I don't like you.

439
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,395
That's what i'm talking about.

440
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,874
Let me tell you something, half-breed.

441
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,357
- I don't care what you have to say about...
- You don't care about anything.

442
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,753
The difference between you
and J.D. Cahill.

443
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,712
Even them that hates him,
admire him for that.

444
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,074
He cares.

445
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,879
He doesn't care about Billy Joe and me.

446
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,873
Kid, i've had buffalo brains
that's got more going for them than you.

447
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,229
You got a bad feeling about your pa
'cause he ain't home every night...

448
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,436
to powder your butt and tuck you in.

449
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,034
What business is it of yours, anyway?

450
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,072
I've ridden with him.

451
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,032
And i've sweat with him.

452
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,031
And i've froze with him.

453
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,517
And i've tracked for him.

454
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,511
And i've cooked for him.

455
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,474
And i've covered
even two dozen gunfights...

456
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,993
Here he comes.

457
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,232
And what's more...

458
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:59,757
I've set near about every bone in his body
that's decent enough to talk about.

459
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:07,189
They're out there, all right,
camped in the shelter of some trees.

460
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,554
Daniel...

461
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,908
get your rifle.

462
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,399
You taking him with you?

463
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,515
Yeah.

464
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,749
J. D...

465
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,712
give me my $5.

466
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,429
You get shot tonight, I disappear.

467
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,551
I'll come back and bury you.

468
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,552
Mumble something Christian
over your grave.

469
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:28,351
Lightfoot, your kindness overwhelms me.

470
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,829
It might not be them out there, Pa.

471
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,872
Let's go ask them.

472
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,356
- The fire's dying out.
- Let it.

473
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,909
I'd think a long time
before I did anything rash.

474
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,674
Cahill.

475
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,237
United States Marshal.

476
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,837
- Pa!
- Hold it!

477
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,512
Mister, I ain't got a bigoted bone
in my body.

478
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,312
You don't drop that axe...

479
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,710
I'll blast you to Hell
as quick as I would a white man.

480
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,473
Come on in.

481
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,399
All right. Let's get rid of the hardware.

482
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,709
Boy.

483
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,070
I ain't got no knife, mister.

484
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,868
Friend...

485
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,554
you look like a hideaway man to me.

486
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,069
What is it?

487
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,037
Derringer or a palm gun?

488
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,914
Lightfoot.

489
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,069
Yeah?

490
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,677
Are they friends of yours?

491
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,795
Nope.

492
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,192
You know them at all?

493
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,189
Nope.

494
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,989
Daniel?

495
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,479
I don't know them.

496
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,553
That ought to do about as much damage
to a bank door as a sledgehammer.

497
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,596
Wouldn't you say, Daniel?

498
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,839
New money.

499
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,278
Where'd you get it?

500
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:14,592
Where'd you get it?

501
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,679
Don't, Pa!

502
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,958
Ben Grady leaves a wife
and two little boys.

503
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,232
I asked you a question.

504
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,834
You may gather i'm a little impatient.

505
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,916
Where'd you get that money?

506
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,992
We took it from a Mormon drover
in New Mexico.

507
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,794
We had a lot less than we needed...

508
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,711
and he had a lot more than he needed.

509
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,950
Mormon drover in New Mexico?

510
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,468
Yes, sir.

511
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,871
That's the God's truth.

512
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,834
How old are you, boy?

513
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,069
He's 16.

514
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,991
Just turned 16, is all.

515
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,793
Belong to you?

516
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,233
My grandson.

517
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,956
Mister, you ain't gonna put those on me.

518
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,998
- Daniel, get their horses.
- You ain't going to!

519
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:11,196
Either that or i'll kill you.

520
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,192
I don't think they did it, Pa.

521
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,794
That's for the jury to say, not me.

522
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,231
I don't think they did it.

523
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,760
Son, if you know something I don't...

524
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,150
I'd be obliged to hear about it.

525
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,630
Otherwise, go get their horses.

526
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,038
- Five pounds of tea.
- Golden tips, ma'am?

527
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,839
No, Oongal or Black Oolong, Mr. Campbell.

528
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,229
And a 140-pound sack
of Ceylon java coffee.

529
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,796
Five pounds of Wilbur's Breakfast Cocoa.

530
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,036
One pound of black pepper.

531
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,270
Five pounds of mustard powder.

532
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,672
And three quarts
of medicinal blackberry brandy.

533
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:34,154
Look who's got his nose in the candy.

534
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,718
He can have two.

535
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,959
There's two...

536
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,117
and two more for good luck, Billy Joe.

537
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,519
Thank you!

538
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,554
And six two-pound tins of plum pudding.

539
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,878
And i want...
Now, Billy Joe, put that down.

540
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,350
- That's much too heavy for you.
- No, ma'am. Not at all.

541
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,275
And...

542
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,669
a dozen Crosse & Blackwell mixed jerky.

543
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,068
The money wasn't
where it was supposed to be.

544
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,271
It wasn't where we told you to put it.

545
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,715
And we looked, but it just wasn't there.

546
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,190
We is some disappointed in you, boy.

547
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:59,477
Struther practically being a father to you,
and all.

548
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,477
And him taking your betrayal of us
real personally...

549
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,391
he wanted to come into town
and cut you up real bad.

550
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,716
But i told him that wasn't necessary.

551
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,995
There must be
some kind of misunderstanding...

552
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,991
cause you is a good boy.

553
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,599
A good boy...

554
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,076
who wouldn't betray his friends.

555
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:23,869
No, sir. I just wouldn't believe
that you'd do anything so...

556
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,794
foolish.

557
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,952
Where's the money?

558
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,428
Struther.

559
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,679
Where's the money?

560
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:41,633
- I hid it.
- Where? You hid it where?

561
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,792
I ain't telling. I ain't.

562
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,678
Why in the hell not, you little son of a...

563
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,719
Why not?
Would you explain it to me, please?

564
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,110
Because me and mine
don't like to be threatened...

565
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,350
and chased and told what to do.

566
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,438
If you kill me,
you ain't never gonna find that money.

567
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:05,635
Never!

568
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,791
Pick him up. We gotta take him
where nobody will hear him scream.

569
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,791
- Come here.
- Let me down!

570
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,352
- Damn you.
- Get him!

571
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,912
Watch out! Damn wire!

572
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,630
Where the hell did he get to?

573
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,153
Trouble, J.D.

574
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,234
I see them.

575
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,398
They look nasty, Pa.

576
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:33,795
Yeah.

577
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,155
Friends of Ben Grady, I guess.

578
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,549
Yeah.

579
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,113
There's that.

580
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,311
But mostly, it's money.

581
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:45,993
Bank gets robbed, town goes broke.

582
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:50,149
Most people think
all that money belongs to the bankers.

583
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:52,148
It don't.

584
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,351
It's the little folks' savings.

585
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,959
What about us?

586
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,869
Yeah.

587
00:47:58,040 --> 00:47:59,553
What about you?

588
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:21,470
We'll take them from here on, J.D.

589
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,119
Just like that?

590
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,199
Just like that.

591
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:28,518
Lightfoot, how far away
would you say they are?

592
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,591
About 10, 12 feet.

593
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,640
Make a good pattern for this buckshot.

594
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,396
There's no use potting around.

595
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,675
I'm willing to die trying to keep them.

596
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:41,877
The question is, are you willing to die
trying to take them?

597
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,150
Now, I'm cold and hungry, and...

598
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,035
wet and tired and short-tempered.

599
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,038
So get on with it.

600
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:03,997
Hell, get out of my way!

601
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,079
- J.D.!
- Hank.

602
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,474
Your littlest boy's come down
with something.

603
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,195
Bad?

604
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,398
That's the word.

605
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:45,674
Cock it.

606
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,229
Howdy.

607
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,070
Go on, I'll take care of it.

608
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,110
Where is he?

609
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,555
- He's in with the doctor, J.D.
- Which room?

610
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:31,235
The doctor doesn't want anybody in there
until he's finished with the boy.

611
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,949
Now, you can just wait right here.

612
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:38,915
Women.

613
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,548
Things seem to happen to you two
when I'm...

614
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:49,909
not around.

615
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,753
Like the time Gordine's horse kicked you...

616
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,592
- And broke your leg...
- Pa?

617
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,352
And the time Billy Joe...

618
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:58,829
- Got poison ivy all over his face and...
- Pa?

619
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:02,671
You ain't never around.

620
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:08,397
You're dead right, Daniel.
I can't argue that.

621
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:13,235
I've been gone a lot of times
when you kids really needed me.

622
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,036
And I've missed a lot, too.

623
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,475
Missed watching you two grow up.

624
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,958
I think about it a lot...

625
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,513
on every job...

626
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:27,796
about how, when it's over...

627
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:31,589
I'll come home and the three of us
will get to know one another.

628
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:34,959
But even before that job was finished...

629
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,630
another one always seemed...

630
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:38,869
to crop up.

631
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:42,793
Another bank robbed, another murder.

632
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:48,629
I don't want what I'm saying
to sound like I'm making excuses.

633
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,555
There's no excuse for negligence.

634
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,915
No excuse for a man ignoring his...

635
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,159
duty, either.

636
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,875
Your mother...

637
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,518
God bless her...

638
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,272
when she was dying...

639
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,914
the last thing she said on earth was:

640
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,518
"Go get them, J.D."

641
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:14,477
And I've been going...

642
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,950
and getting them ever since...

643
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,954
till it's no longer just my job.

644
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,878
It's part of my life.

645
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,870
And that's what I want you
to try and understand, Son.

646
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,552
Your old man's life.

647
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,871
Will you give it a try?

648
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,276
Yeah, Pa. I'll try.

649
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,599
I'm glad...

650
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:45,074
'cause even grown men
need understanding.

651
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,355
I'll be by tomorrow, Billy Joe.

652
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:51,875
Doc.

653
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:55,151
He has a high fever, J.D.

654
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,468
How high?

655
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:57,994
A hundred and three.

656
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:01,231
- A hundred and three...
- But it's not climbing, it's leveled off.

657
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,191
The boy has a touch of pneumonia.

658
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:06,669
- Just pneumonia?
- But he's young.

659
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,150
Proper bed rest, good care...

660
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:10,548
he'll be as good as new.

661
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:11,834
You sure, Doc?

662
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,992
I'd bet my brand-new, Chicago-made...

663
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:16,798
leg amputator on it.

664
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,112
He's worried about one thing, though.

665
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,235
What's that?

666
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:21,514
Your shoulder.

667
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,591
He wants me to take a look at it.

668
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,715
Forget it.

669
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:25,915
Thanks, Doc.

670
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,594
- Can we...
- Go right ahead.

671
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,319
Hello, Budger.

672
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,593
How are you?

673
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,519
I'm all right, Pa.

674
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:44,239
Sure you're all right, you're a Cahill.

675
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:48,070
Cahills have survived floods,
earthquakes, pestilence...

676
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,550
every natural disaster known to man.
Not to mention...

677
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,878
a few unnatural ones.

678
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,758
Can I get you anything?
You hungry or thirsty?

679
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:58,909
No.

680
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,116
I'm just a little tired, Pa.

681
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,709
All right, Son. You get some sleep.

682
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:07,553
Get some rest.

683
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,795
When you get back on your feet...

684
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,393
me and you and...

685
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,152
old Daniel there...

686
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,189
gonna get to know each other better.

687
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:20,871
- It sounds like a promise.
- You can believe it, Son.

688
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,072
- Pa?
- Yes.

689
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,789
You never told me a promise before.

690
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:35,475
No...

691
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,438
I guess I never.

692
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,919
Hetty, I...

693
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,752
I'll be back.

694
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,270
I gotta check on some prisoners.

695
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,157
I'll sit with him now.

696
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,989
You look done in yourself, Daniel.

697
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:07,229
No.

698
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,198
Only on the outside.

699
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,157
Tried to kill me, Danny.

700
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,835
I hid the money
and wouldn't tell him where...

701
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,593
because I thought
we might wanna give it back.

702
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:36,110
And they tried to kill me.
I been afeard to sleep, Danny.

703
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,955
You go to sleep, Billy Joe Cahill.

704
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,871
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

705
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,238
- Danny!
- Sit down!

706
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,236
Now, I'm gonna ask you
one more time, boy.

707
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,959
- And if you don't answer...
- Close the window.

708
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,792
- What'd you say?
- Close the window.

709
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,348
My brother's sick.
You want him to catch his death?

710
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,032
Where's the money?

711
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:03,472
We killed two men to get it.
You gotta understand, boy...

712
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:06,916
we ain't gonna hang any longer
or be any deader if we kill two more.

713
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,319
Where's our money?

714
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,912
Tell him, Billy Joe.

715
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:15,755
Let him have the money and get.
We'll give ourselves up and confess.

716
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:19,710
I never meant for four innocent men
to hang for something I did, anyway.

717
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,918
Tell him, Billy Joe.

718
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:31,834
I can't.

719
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:34,235
You don't believe I'll kill you?

720
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,358
It was pitch-dark.

721
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,749
And I was scared near outta my pants.

722
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:42,229
I went this way and that way, and...

723
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,069
well...

724
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,038
I know where it is.

725
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:49,350
But I can't tell you where it is.

726
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,637
I kinda have to find it again,
if you can understand?

727
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:57,919
Get him dressed.

728
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,195
- He's got pneumonia.
- I don't give a...

729
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,669
- What'd you say?
- I said, he's got pneumonia.

730
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:06,309
Even if you kill me and take him,
he won't live an hour out in that rain.

731
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:18,349
When did the doctor say
he'd be on his feet again?

732
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:19,759
Didn't say.

733
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:24,634
When he is, you know where we'll be.

734
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:26,315
Yeah.

735
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,474
You swear.

736
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:46,999
You swear on your brother's life
and on his everlasting spirit...

737
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:50,959
may it rot in Hell for time eternal
if you break your oath to me.

738
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:55,435
You swear you'll bring that money to me
within a fortnight.

739
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:58,557
And that you won't tell anybody,
anybody at all...

740
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,153
about what you've done.

741
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:02,956
Or what we done before you.

742
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:05,188
Swear it.

743
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,309
I swear.

744
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,879
On your brother's life and eternal spirit.

745
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:18,474
On my brother's life and eternal spirit.

746
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:48,873
Funny thing.

747
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,350
I keep thinking about my mama.

748
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,635
She said I was born to be hung.

749
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,752
But to be hung for something I didn't do.

750
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,758
Of all the bad things I've done.

751
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:04,718
I killed my first man
when I was 12 years old.

752
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:06,512
Now to be hung...

753
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:12,071
- You know who's going to do it?
- That kid, I guess.

754
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,312
He's acting sheriff.

755
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,069
Sure hope he knows what he's doing.

756
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,716
I seen a man choke-hung once.

757
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,876
Didn't break his neck proper.

758
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,078
It was five minutes
before he stopped kicking.

759
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,678
Did they shoot him?

760
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:31,309
No.

761
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:34,314
It wasn't a lynching, you understand.

762
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:37,075
It was a legal, proper hanging.

763
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:40,592
And they don't shoot you
at legal, proper hangings.

764
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,439
Dirty bastards.

765
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,039
Good morning.

766
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:07,272
There's some makings.

767
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:12,075
- You the one that chews?
- Yes, sir.

768
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,713
Thank you kindly.

769
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:18,597
They made up their minds yet?

770
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:23,432
Wednesday morning.

771
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:31,034
Two days.

772
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:43,274
Marshal?

773
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:48,232
This damn animal...

774
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,152
keeps taking in air.

775
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:53,354
Looks pretty grim
for them fellows in there.

776
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:54,475
Yeah.

777
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:57,154
Mr. Cahill, you think they did it?

778
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,839
Jury said they did. Judge sentenced them.

779
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,838
What I'm asking is,
do you think they did it?

780
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,950
I think they're guilty as hell...

781
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:10,958
of robbing a Mormon drover
in New Mexico.

782
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,073
And I gotta hang them.

783
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,312
Goes with the badge.

784
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,709
Anytime you boys want to come back,
you're welcome, and don't you forget that.

785
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:42,076
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Thanks for taking care of me, too.

786
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:44,674
I was glad to do anything I could, Billy Joe.

787
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,955
You kinda like our pa, don't you?

788
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,596
Now, what makes you say that?

789
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,910
You look at him funny sometimes.

790
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:54,918
Maybe there's a lot of words
being spoke inside your head...

791
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,911
that nobody can hear except you.

792
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,390
Billy Joe, I'll talk to you
about that in 10 or 15 years.

793
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:06,315
That sound gives me the shivers.

794
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:09,870
I wonder what it's doing
to those who're waiting for it.

795
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,717
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Bye.

796
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:15,149
Bye.

797
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:50,510
Things didn't work out
like we planned, did they, Danny?

798
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:52,913
No, they didn't.

799
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:57,917
And I ain't blaming
that no-good Struther, neither.

800
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:02,633
It was like the Lord and the Devil
was having a tug of war in my gut.

801
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:04,473
The Devil won.

802
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:07,595
Seems like the Devil always wins.

803
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:10,953
Maybe that's why so many people
are on his side.

804
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:12,075
Yeah.

805
01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:13,952
But I ain't really.

806
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:17,518
I just wanted to get back at Pa
for never being around.

807
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:19,397
Pa ain't so bad, Danny.

808
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:23,070
Let's tell him about the whole thing
and be done with it.

809
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:24,754
We can't.

810
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:28,074
Figure we don't know him
well enough yet?

811
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:30,112
No, that ain't it.

812
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:34,470
If Pa gets himself into something,
he gets himself out.

813
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:36,636
And that's what we gotta do.

814
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,958
Get ourselves out
without Fraser killing us.

815
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:45,670
Sure is hard, acting like a man.

816
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:52,989
- Almost didn't find you.
- Hell, J. D...

817
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:54,991
I left a trail a blind man could follow.

818
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:56,593
- They didn't go home?
- Nope.

819
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:58,796
- Where are they?
- Right there.

820
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:02,309
- What are they doing?
- Just sitting.

821
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:05,630
- They pick up the money?
- Nope.

822
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:09,994
Fishing.

823
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:12,551
Just sitting and fishing.

824
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:15,919
Four men are gonna hang
for something they didn't do...

825
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,468
and they're just sitting and fishing.

826
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,433
There they go.

827
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:38,794
Lightfoot.

828
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,754
Amy and me tried for a lot of years...

829
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:45,032
to have children.

830
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:46,675
But...

831
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,479
maybe they came along too late in my life.

832
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:54,594
- Yeah?
- There ain't nothing too late...

833
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:56,919
if you love it.

834
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:30,596
Danny!

835
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:32,554
I'm here.

836
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:03,389
Here.

837
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:14,914
Come on.

838
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:32,874
Come on.

839
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:45,235
Where'd you bury it, Billy Joe?

840
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:49,558
It was pitch-black. I didn't have a lantern.

841
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:50,789
I...

842
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,672
can't quite remember.

843
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:02,595
There.

844
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:04,348
Hold this.

845
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:20,310
You're making enough noise
to wake the dead.

846
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:22,834
It wouldn't hurt
to be a little quiet and careful.

847
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:23,989
For what?

848
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:26,275
To take candy away from babies?

849
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:33,794
Why do you suppose
they wouldn't tell me?

850
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:36,838
Didn't they know
if they confided in me, I'd...

851
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:40,157
Give them a chance, J.D.

852
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:43,118
Probably got it worked out
in some kids' way.

853
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:44,235
Kids?

854
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:45,759
Bank robbers.

855
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:57,395
God!

856
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:59,755
Some poor soul leaving his mortal body.

857
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:03,276
- I knowed! I know it!
- I think it's just an old hoot owl.

858
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:06,468
You sure?

859
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:08,549
Nope.

860
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:19,757
Did you see them bank robbers
jump out of their pants...

861
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:21,519
when that old owl hooted?

862
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:25,309
I am now gonna give them a scare
they ain't never gonna forget.

863
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:29,354
While their pants are down,
I'll give them a little parental guidance.

864
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:35,591
- Found something?
- I hope it's the right something.

865
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:40,796
- They got the money.
- Yeah.

866
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:45,314
Come on.

867
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,153
Holy Christmas!

868
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,360
Like taking candy away from babies?

869
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:26,954
Very funny.

870
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:33,196
I'll tell you something funnier.

871
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:35,436
- What's that?
- My leg's broke.

872
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:45,397
We're gonna have to straighten it
and splint it.

873
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:52,068
I thought an Indian didn't show pain.

874
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:55,551
Especially a bona fide
Comanche war chief.

875
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:58,957
Who in the hell ever told you that,
a damn white man?

876
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:03,118
This is gonna hurt.
Here's something to bite on.

877
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:05,593
Thank you, J.D.

878
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,711
This knothead of yours...

879
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,429
almost ran my butt into the ground.

880
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,558
Couldn't find mine.

881
01:12:37,680 --> 01:12:39,750
Must've headed for the barn.

882
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:44,390
I hope you're enjoying my cigar.

883
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:46,794
Not bad.

884
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,033
How's the leg?

885
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:52,676
If you're asking me as a war chief
of the Comanche nation...

886
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:54,478
I don't feel a thing.

887
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:58,350
If you're asking the white part of me,
it hurts like hell.

888
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:05,315
- That's the white man groaning, I take it?
- You're damn right.

889
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:19,879
I'll need that bottle of whiskey you've got.

890
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:24,116
When you're finished with this thing,
if you should come out alive...

891
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:26,794
you can come
and do some hunting for me.

892
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,996
I'll be stove up all spring.

893
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:35,912
Yeah. You might bring
a box of them cigars, too.

894
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,831
You ain't finished yet.

895
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:40,556
- Ain't finished?
- That's right.

896
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:43,633
What the hell are you talking about?
My leg's broke.

897
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:45,836
I'm going home. That's what I'm gonna do.

898
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:48,957
- No, you ain't. You're gonna finish the job.
- Why?

899
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,830
Because you're a better tracker than I am.

900
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:54,195
And there's no time for mistakes.

901
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:57,072
So start tracking.

902
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:20,316
You just stay where you are.

903
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:22,716
MacDonald, this is Cahill.

904
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:24,833
How are you?

905
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:26,149
Fine.

906
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:29,552
Leastwise, ain't no one tried
to hang me lately.

907
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:34,829
Well?

908
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:36,958
There's the gate.

909
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:44,519
I'm in trouble.

910
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:46,999
I need a horse.

911
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:50,952
I'm willing to pay.

912
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:53,358
In back of you.

913
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:54,555
Thanks.

914
01:15:56,200 --> 01:15:57,713
That's no horse.

915
01:15:58,040 --> 01:15:59,473
It's a horse.

916
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:03,673
Leastways, as much of a horse
as you'll find within 20 miles of here.

917
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:11,112
I got an old McClellan.
I'll throw that in, $50.

918
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:13,113
$50?

919
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:15,712
You want them or not?

920
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,514
Your feet.

921
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:24,079
Get the McClellan.

922
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:31,072
Stay with him, J.D.!

923
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,433
Stay with him!

924
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,116
Might be faster if you walked.

925
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:47,472
More comfortable, too.

926
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:50,030
Seeing as we're in such a hurry.

927
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:55,478
Of course, $50 ain't too much to pay for...

928
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:58,348
a spirited, well-bred animal like that.

929
01:16:58,600 --> 01:16:59,953
Lightfoot...

930
01:17:00,160 --> 01:17:03,197
I never heard a bona fide war chief
talk so much.

931
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:30,200
How much further you calculate, Danny?

932
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:32,032
About an hour.

933
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:31,514
Stay here, Billy Joe.

934
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:34,876
- No, sir, I can't...
- I said, you stay here, Billy Joe.

935
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:45,789
Fraser!

936
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:52,598
Abe Fraser!

937
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,592
Nobody's in there.

938
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:10,235
No...

939
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:12,434
Billy Joe?

940
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:17,274
You shouldn't oughta treat me like a baby.

941
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:20,477
- I'm near 13 years old.
- You're only 11, and that's all you are!

942
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:24,189
Eleven going on 12,
and you ain't grown no brains yet at all.

943
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:26,312
That's your excuse.

944
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:27,795
I'm 17.

945
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:32,633
I must've lost any brains I ever had
to get us into a mess like this.

946
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:39,274
Those men are gonna hang because of us.

947
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:42,110
I can't get it off my mind.

948
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:45,632
If Fraser don't get here quick,
it'll be too late.

949
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:54,474
You calculate that they'll kill us
if they can, don't you, Danny?

950
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:18,319
Don't like it.

951
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:20,118
Don't like it at all.

952
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,389
There ain't no easy way to do this.

953
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:27,317
So let's go find out.

954
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:50,555
Damn!

955
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:53,554
Lightfoot!

956
01:23:14,640 --> 01:23:16,835
Well, don't break out in tears.

957
01:23:18,680 --> 01:23:21,240
You've seen dying men before, ain't you?

958
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:31,039
I want a cigar.

959
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:35,231
Won't do you much good...

960
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:37,391
coughing the way you are.

961
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:40,036
Won't do me no harm, neither.

962
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:08,632
You don't have to worry about your family
while I'm alive.

963
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:10,312
Hell, I know that.

964
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:15,796
I always loved these things.

965
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:18,511
Never could afford them.

966
01:25:29,640 --> 01:25:31,596
You got a nice bright fire.

967
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:33,033
Signal fire.

968
01:25:34,680 --> 01:25:37,638
Except there's nobody to signal to.
Ain't that right, Brownie?

969
01:25:37,720 --> 01:25:40,029
I told you I took care of things.

970
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:43,038
Where's your brother?

971
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:44,712
Where's Billy Joe?

972
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:47,551
Right here, Mr. Fraser.

973
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:53,034
Boy, you better put that thing down.

974
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:56,596
Billy Joe, that ain't necessary.
We're all friends here.

975
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:02,996
Boy, this is old Abe Fraser.

976
01:26:03,680 --> 01:26:06,194
Danny, tell him that ain't necessary.

977
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:19,956
There's your share of the money,
Mr. Fraser.

978
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:22,156
Three-fifths. About $12,000.

979
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:25,993
That ain't right, Danny.

980
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:29,231
The usual way, the proper way,
is for the leader to make the split.

981
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:33,472
It all works out the same way
but one likes to observe the proprieties.

982
01:26:33,560 --> 01:26:34,993
You understand.

983
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:39,150
- You got the rest of the money with you?
- No, we don't.

984
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:41,077
That money's well hid.

985
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:43,709
We didn't come here
to get our throats slit.

986
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,911
You'd just best take your share and go.

987
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,468
You're a hard case, ain't you,
just like your old man?

988
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:49,754
No, I ain't!

989
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:53,628
If it was him, he'd shoot you
while he had the chance. Right now.

990
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:57,159
You'd best take that money
and get while you still can.

991
01:26:57,240 --> 01:26:58,389
No.

992
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:00,479
No, I won't.

993
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:02,315
You won't?

994
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,868
Not till I've had my say
and cleared my name.

995
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:06,229
Fraser!

996
01:27:06,320 --> 01:27:08,595
We played fair and square with you.

997
01:27:08,680 --> 01:27:12,468
In spite of your youth and inexperience,
we agreed to share equally with you.

998
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:13,879
And we have.

999
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:16,116
You agree to that, don't you?

1000
01:27:19,080 --> 01:27:20,877
And you, Billy Joe...

1001
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:25,831
who was it let you stay in bed
so you'd get well?

1002
01:27:27,240 --> 01:27:30,630
Of course we had some disagreement,
on account of you changing your mind.

1003
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:31,835
Not us.

1004
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:35,788
I was gonna invite you
to come to my sister's with us.

1005
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:38,440
And take you under my wing, as it were.

1006
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:43,635
But I see that ain't your wish. So I'll...

1007
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:45,392
say goodbye to you.

1008
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:49,913
I offer you my hand in friendship
and in parting.

1009
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,231
I sure hope you won't shame me
by refusing to take it.

1010
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:01,398
Goodbye, Mr. Fraser.

1011
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:02,439
They'll be waiting for us,
won't they, Danny?

1012
01:29:02,520 --> 01:29:04,750
Better now than in the daylight.

1013
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:44,669
Pa!

1014
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:49,557
- Am I ever glad to see you.
- Still got the money?

1015
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:52,832
- Part of it.
- Fraser's taken his share already?

1016
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:55,029
Yes.

1017
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:56,673
Where's yours?

1018
01:29:57,240 --> 01:29:59,470
- We buried it. L...
- Go dig it up.

1019
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:03,709
Just back them up and go around it.

1020
01:30:06,040 --> 01:30:07,632
You ain't leaving?

1021
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:11,473
Four innocent men
are gonna get hung in the morning.

1022
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:13,516
I'm going back to stop it.

1023
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:19,712
- Take Billy Joe with you.
- Just do as you're told.

1024
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:23,316
Don't you understand?
They're gonna be there waiting for us!

1025
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:29,313
J.D. Cahill.

1026
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:33,230
Doesn't give a damn about us.

1027
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:36,909
Back.

1028
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:48,433
Danny, look out!

1029
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:11,196
I gave you your chance.
You gotta give me that.

1030
01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:14,477
- I held out my hand in friendship and...
- In a pig's eye, you did.

1031
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:16,994
You was gonna kill us
the first chance you got.

1032
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:20,231
The trouble with you, boy,
is that you got no grace.

1033
01:32:20,440 --> 01:32:23,000
You should allow a man his illusions.

1034
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:33,635
Danny!

1035
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:44,229
Fraser!

1036
01:33:08,840 --> 01:33:10,512
Danny, are you dead?

1037
01:33:11,480 --> 01:33:13,471
Got the wind knocked out of me.

1038
01:33:13,560 --> 01:33:16,757
Boy, you really had me scared,
lying there like that.

1039
01:33:22,760 --> 01:33:25,194
- Give me that horse.
- We got the money.

1040
01:33:25,480 --> 01:33:26,674
I want him.

1041
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:29,593
And I want them two boys,
and I want them bad.

1042
01:33:32,360 --> 01:33:34,157
You staked us out, Pa.

1043
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:37,238
Before you form any lasting judgment
on me...

1044
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:40,393
it was the only way
I could get Fraser out into the open.

1045
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,198
We almost got killed.

1046
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:45,597
You could have got killed
robbing that bank, too.

1047
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:50,719
Are they gone?

1048
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:52,273
We can't worry about them.

1049
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:54,749
We have to get back to town
before morning.

1050
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,956
What's gonna happen to us?

1051
01:33:57,720 --> 01:33:59,153
I don't know.

1052
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:02,029
We'll get a fair trial, won't we?

1053
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:04,760
Lots of men get a fair trial and hang.

1054
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:08,192
We were gonna give back
our share of the money.

1055
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:09,998
I know you were, Son.

1056
01:34:10,600 --> 01:34:11,999
And confess.

1057
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:14,036
And we did try to stop the killing.

1058
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:16,236
- I know, Daniel. I wish...
- Pa!

1059
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:52,671
I'll get the money, Pa.

1060
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:56,278
Here, Billy Joe.

1061
01:34:58,200 --> 01:34:59,394
Hold it.

1062
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:21,116
You'd even shoot a dead man!

1063
01:35:21,240 --> 01:35:24,152
No, and I ain't gonna let him
shoot me, neither.

1064
01:35:24,280 --> 01:35:25,429
Get up.

1065
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:28,313
Get me a rope.

1066
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:46,589
Budger.

1067
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:50,196
You're bleeding again, Pa.

1068
01:35:51,360 --> 01:35:53,396
I guess it goes with the badge.

1069
01:35:53,480 --> 01:35:55,391
- You got a kerchief?
- Yeah.

1070
01:35:57,560 --> 01:36:00,358
Jam it in this hole. It'll stop the bleeding.

1071
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:04,912
Here, I'll do it.

1072
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:13,233
Thank you, Pa.

1073
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,911
Here's the money, all of it.

1074
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:18,075
Good.

1075
01:36:19,840 --> 01:36:21,114
I hope...

1076
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:25,635
Now what's gonna happen to us?

1077
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:29,078
They're gonna be
a little short of witnesses.

1078
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:33,510
And I can sure testify
that you got the town its money back.

1079
01:36:34,720 --> 01:36:37,792
Do you think
that it'll be reason enough maybe...

1080
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:40,394
for the judge to put us in your custody?

1081
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:42,038
I don't know, Son.

1082
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:43,468
He might.

1083
01:36:43,760 --> 01:36:45,398
But we can't depend on it.

1084
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:50,514
If he does, does that mean
you'll be staying around home more?

1085
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:53,390
If you'll promise me one thing:

1086
01:36:58,240 --> 01:36:59,798
Don't rob banks.

1087
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:07,311
Let's go stop a hanging.

1088
