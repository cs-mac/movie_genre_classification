1
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:33,273
<i>It looks like a paradise, but it is the
most treacherous desert in the world:</i>

2
00:00:33,484 --> 00:00:36,920
<i>The Kalahari.
After the short rainy season...</i>

3
00:00:37,086 --> 00:00:40,282
<i>...there are many water holes,
and even rivers.</i>

4
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:45,391
<i>But after a few weeks, the water sinks
away into the deep Kalahari sand.</i>

5
00:00:45,593 --> 00:00:48,389
<i>The water holes dry,
and the rivers stop flowing.</i>

6
00:00:48,927 --> 00:00:51,690
<i>The grass fades to a beautiful
blond colour...</i>

7
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:53,888
<i>...that offers excellent grazing for the animals.</i>

8
00:00:54,065 --> 00:00:57,431
<i>But for the next nine months,
there'll be no water to drink.</i>

9
00:00:57,601 --> 00:01:02,230
<i>So most of the animals move away,
leaving the blond grass uneaten.</i>

10
00:01:03,071 --> 00:01:08,405
<i>Humans avoid the Kalahari like the
plague because man must have water.</i>

11
00:01:08,574 --> 00:01:12,236
<i>So the beautiful landscapes
are devoid of people.</i>

12
00:01:12,845 --> 00:01:17,405
<i>Except for the little people
of the Kalahari.</i>

13
00:01:22,751 --> 00:01:27,153
<i>Pretty, dainty, small and graceful,
the Bushmen.</i>

14
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:30,786
<i>Where any other person
would die of thirst in a few days...</i>

15
00:01:30,956 --> 00:01:34,619
<i>...they live quite contentedly
in this desert.</i>

16
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,354
<i>They know where to dig for roots
and bugs and tubers...</i>

17
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,588
<i>...and which berries and pods
are good to eat.</i>

18
00:01:56,642 --> 00:01:59,110
<i>Of course they know what to do
about water.</i>

19
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,938
<i>In the early morning,
you can collect dewdrops...</i>

20
00:02:02,113 --> 00:02:05,774
<i>...from leaves that were carefully
laid out the previous evening.</i>

21
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:13,446
<i>Or a plume of grass
can be a reservoir.</i>

22
00:02:13,653 --> 00:02:18,317
<i>If you have the know-how, a clump
of twigs can tell you where to dig...</i>

23
00:02:18,491 --> 00:02:21,754
<i>...and you come to light
with an enormous tuber.</i>

24
00:02:25,062 --> 00:02:29,656
<i>You scrape shavings off it with a stick
that is split for a sharp edge.</i>

25
00:02:29,832 --> 00:02:34,529
<i>You take a handful of the shavings, point
your thumb at your mouth and squeeze.</i>

26
00:02:42,774 --> 00:02:45,674
<i>They must be the most
contented people in the world.</i>

27
00:02:45,843 --> 00:02:49,369
<i>They have no crime, no punishment,
no violence, no laws...</i>

28
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:52,980
<i>...no police, judges, rulers or bosses.</i>

29
00:02:55,082 --> 00:03:00,576
<i>They believe that the gods put only good
and useful things on the earth for them.</i>

30
00:03:00,853 --> 00:03:03,720
<i>In this world of theirs,
nothing is bad or evil.</i>

31
00:03:05,823 --> 00:03:07,882
<i>Even a poisonous snake is not bad.</i>

32
00:03:08,358 --> 00:03:10,883
<i>You just have to keep away
from the sharp end.</i>

33
00:03:13,662 --> 00:03:17,529
<i>Actually, a snake is very good.
In fact, it's delicious.</i>

34
00:03:17,732 --> 00:03:20,097
<i>And the skin makes a fine pouch.</i>

35
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:25,369
<i>They live in the vastness of the
Kalahari in small family groups.</i>

36
00:03:25,537 --> 00:03:29,438
<i>One family of Bushmen might meet up
with another once in a few years.</i>

37
00:03:29,607 --> 00:03:32,871
<i>But for the most part,
they live in complete isolation...</i>

38
00:03:33,042 --> 00:03:35,805
<i>...unaware there are other people
in the world.</i>

39
00:03:36,078 --> 00:03:41,515
<i>In the deep Kalahari, there are Bushmen
who have not heard of civilized man.</i>

40
00:03:41,682 --> 00:03:45,447
<i>Sometimes they hear a thundering
sound when there are no clouds.</i>

41
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:50,552
<i>They assume the gods have eaten too
much and their tummies are rumbling.</i>

42
00:03:50,755 --> 00:03:54,884
<i>Sometimes they can even see
the evidence of the gods' flatulence.</i>

43
00:03:55,391 --> 00:03:57,916
<i>Their language has
an idiosyncrasy of its own.</i>

44
00:03:58,127 --> 00:04:01,583
<i>It seems to consist
mainly of clicking sounds.</i>

45
00:04:07,367 --> 00:04:09,232
<i>They're very gentle people.</i>

46
00:04:09,401 --> 00:04:12,336
<i>They'll never punish a child
or even speak harshly to it.</i>

47
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:18,202
<i>So the kids are extremely well-behaved.
Their games are cute and inventive.</i>

48
00:04:26,713 --> 00:04:28,202
<i>When the family needs meat...</i>

49
00:04:28,381 --> 00:04:31,872
<i>...the hunter dips his arrow
in a brew that acts as a tranquilliser.</i>

50
00:04:32,084 --> 00:04:35,574
<i>When he shoots a buck, it feels
a sting and the arrow drops out.</i>

51
00:04:35,786 --> 00:04:38,447
<i>The buck runs away,
but soon it gets drowsy...</i>

52
00:04:38,621 --> 00:04:40,645
<i>...and it stops running.</i>

53
00:04:42,591 --> 00:04:45,616
<i>After a while, it goes to sleep.</i>

54
00:04:48,895 --> 00:04:55,162
<i>The hunter apologizes. He explains
that his family needs the meat.</i>

55
00:04:56,801 --> 00:05:01,463
<i>The characteristic which really makes
them different from all other races...</i>

56
00:05:01,637 --> 00:05:04,606
<i>...is that they have
no sense of ownership at all.</i>

57
00:05:05,006 --> 00:05:07,473
<i>Where they live,
there's nothing you can own.</i>

58
00:05:07,642 --> 00:05:10,234
<i>Only trees and grass and animals.</i>

59
00:05:10,444 --> 00:05:14,072
<i>These Bushmen have never seen
a stone or a rock in their lives.</i>

60
00:05:14,246 --> 00:05:17,476
<i>The hardest things they know
are wood and bone.</i>

61
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:24,079
<i>They live in a gentle world, where nothing
is as hard as rock, steel or concrete.</i>

62
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:30,823
<i>Only 600 miles to the south,
there's a vast city.</i>

63
00:05:34,193 --> 00:05:37,320
<i>And here you find civilized man.</i>

64
00:05:59,978 --> 00:06:03,209
<i>Civilized man refused
to adapt himself to his environment.</i>

65
00:06:03,414 --> 00:06:06,041
<i>Instead he adapted his environment
to suit him.</i>

66
00:06:06,216 --> 00:06:09,116
<i>So he built cities, roads,
vehicles, machinery.</i>

67
00:06:09,518 --> 00:06:13,543
<i>And he put up power lines
to run his labour-saving devices.</i>

68
00:06:13,787 --> 00:06:15,618
<i>But he didn't know when to stop.</i>

69
00:06:15,823 --> 00:06:18,916
<i>The more he improved his
surroundings to make life easier...</i>

70
00:06:19,058 --> 00:06:21,321
<i>...the more complicated he made it.</i>

71
00:06:21,527 --> 00:06:25,359
<i>Now his children are sentenced to
10 to 15 years of school, to learn...</i>

72
00:06:25,563 --> 00:06:28,861
<i>...how to survive in this complex
and hazardous habitat.</i>

73
00:06:29,532 --> 00:06:33,126
<i>And civilized man, who refused
to adapt to his surroundings...</i>

74
00:06:33,302 --> 00:06:35,792
<i>...now finds he has to adapt
and re-adapt...</i>

75
00:06:36,004 --> 00:06:39,938
<i>...every hour of the day
to his self-created environment.</i>

76
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,068
<i>For instance, if it's Monday...</i>

77
00:06:42,308 --> 00:06:47,040
<i>...and 7:30 comes up, you have to dis-
adapt from your domestic surroundings...</i>

78
00:06:47,212 --> 00:06:51,045
<i>...and re-adapt yourself to an
entirely different environment.</i>

79
00:06:58,486 --> 00:07:02,012
<i>8:00 means everybody
has to look busy.</i>

80
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:09,887
I've got a good story
about handicapped children.

81
00:07:10,061 --> 00:07:15,190
<i>Handicapped children? No! You don't
recommend stuff you don't...</i>

82
00:07:15,364 --> 00:07:20,390
Sorry. I'll only print sweetness and light,
even if it bores the pants off them.

83
00:07:20,769 --> 00:07:24,760
<i>10:30 means you can stop looking
busy for 15 minutes.</i>

84
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:29,668
<i>And then,
you have to look busy again.</i>

85
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:32,607
- Hi, Kate.
- Hi, Pete.

86
00:07:32,776 --> 00:07:35,768
Can you use this about the
teacher shortage in Botswana?

87
00:07:35,978 --> 00:07:37,275
- Good story?
- Yeah.

88
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:39,845
They'll take anybody
who can read and write.

89
00:07:40,014 --> 00:07:43,574
I don't know. I got bawled out
for writing a story on mugging.

90
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:48,049
My page should be sweet and light,
like Liberace and Jackie Onassis.

91
00:07:48,621 --> 00:07:51,748
<i>Your day is chopped into pieces.
In each segment of time...</i>

92
00:07:51,923 --> 00:07:56,086
<i>- ...you adapt to new circumstances.
- May I share a table?</i>

93
00:07:56,259 --> 00:07:59,285
<i>No wonder some people go
off the rails a bit.</i>

94
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,757
Does the noise in my head
bother you?

95
00:08:06,033 --> 00:08:07,523
No.

96
00:08:07,734 --> 00:08:11,134
Still got that story about
the teacher shortage in Botswana?

97
00:08:11,303 --> 00:08:14,738
- Yeah. You gonna use it?
- No. Maybe they can use me.

98
00:08:15,907 --> 00:08:20,866
<i>In the Kalahari, it's always Tuesday,
or Thursday if you like. Or Sunday.</i>

99
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:24,944
<i>No clocks or calendars tell you
to do this or that.</i>

100
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,109
<i>Lately, strange new things
sometimes appeared in the sky.</i>

101
00:08:29,282 --> 00:08:33,013
<i>Noisy birds that flew
without flapping their wings.</i>

102
00:08:45,661 --> 00:08:49,026
<i>One day, something fell from the sky.</i>

103
00:09:03,473 --> 00:09:06,567
<i>Xi had never seen anything
like this in his life.</i>

104
00:09:06,942 --> 00:09:11,605
<i>It looked like water, but it was harder
than anything else in the world.</i>

105
00:09:11,846 --> 00:09:15,804
<i>He wondered why the gods
had sent this thing down to the earth.</i>

106
00:09:20,085 --> 00:09:23,610
<i>It was the strangest and most
beautiful thing they had ever seen.</i>

107
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,051
<i>They wondered why the gods
had sent it to them.</i>

108
00:09:32,861 --> 00:09:37,558
<i>Pabo got his finger stuck in the thing and
the children thought he was very funny.</i>

109
00:09:48,571 --> 00:09:54,974
<i>Xi tried the thing out to cure thongs.
It had the right shape and weight.</i>

110
00:09:55,176 --> 00:09:59,305
<i>It was also beautifully smooth
and ideal for curing snakeskin.</i>

111
00:10:03,781 --> 00:10:07,079
<i>And Pabo discovered
you could make music on it.</i>

112
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,715
<i>And every day they discovered
a new use for the thing.</i>

113
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:18,587
<i>It was harder and heavier and smoother
than anything they'd ever known.</i>

114
00:10:18,725 --> 00:10:22,023
<i>It was the most useful thing
the gods had ever given them.</i>

115
00:10:22,194 --> 00:10:24,321
<i>A real labour-saving device.</i>

116
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:29,462
<i>But the gods had been careless.
They had sent only one.</i>

117
00:10:29,633 --> 00:10:33,534
<i>Now, for the first time, here was a
thing that could not be shared...</i>

118
00:10:33,736 --> 00:10:35,727
<i>...because there was only one of it.</i>

119
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:45,041
<i>Suddenly, everybody needed it
most of the time.</i>

120
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:48,338
<i>A thing they had never needed before
became a necessity.</i>

121
00:10:48,512 --> 00:10:51,413
<i>And unfamiliar emotions
began to stir.</i>

122
00:10:51,615 --> 00:10:55,345
<i>A feeling of wanting to own,
of not wanting to share.</i>

123
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:09,490
<i>Other new things came.
Anger, jealousy, hate and violence.</i>

124
00:11:26,005 --> 00:11:27,768
<i>Xi was angry with the gods.</i>

125
00:11:27,941 --> 00:11:30,875
<i>He shouted, "Take back your thing!
We don't want it!</i>

126
00:11:31,076 --> 00:11:32,838
<i>Look at the trouble it brought. "</i>

127
00:11:33,144 --> 00:11:34,771
<i>The gods did not take it back.</i>

128
00:11:35,012 --> 00:11:38,741
<i>He shouted, "You must be crazy
to send us this thing! Take it back!"</i>

129
00:11:39,014 --> 00:11:41,346
<i>Then he shouted,
"Look out! Look out!"</i>

130
00:11:43,185 --> 00:11:47,677
<i>But he spoke too late and
the thing felled his daughter Dani.</i>

131
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:08,599
<i>Xi carried the thing away
from the shelter and buried it.</i>

132
00:12:22,045 --> 00:12:26,275
<i>That evening, there was no laughter
and no chatter around the family fire.</i>

133
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:30,975
<i>A strange feeling of shame
had come over the family...</i>

134
00:12:31,218 --> 00:12:33,742
<i>...and they were very quiet.</i>

135
00:12:37,321 --> 00:12:42,258
<i>Xi said, "I have buried the thing.
It will not make us unhappy again. "</i>

136
00:12:57,703 --> 00:13:01,900
<i>That night, a hyena smelled the blood
on the thing, and dug it up.</i>

137
00:13:06,409 --> 00:13:12,346
<i>A bad-tempered warthog chased the
hyena away and it dropped the thing.</i>

138
00:13:16,516 --> 00:13:18,506
<i>The next day, Dani found it.</i>

139
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:33,753
<i>Her brother Toma heard her playing on it
and said, "Let me try. Let me try too."</i>

140
00:14:12,122 --> 00:14:15,249
<i>That night the family was very unhappy.</i>

141
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:27,060
<i>They began to talk about this thing.
They did not have a name for it.</i>

142
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:29,825
<i>They called it the "evil thing."</i>

143
00:14:35,806 --> 00:14:38,534
<i>Gaboo said, "Perhaps the gods
were absent-minded...</i>

144
00:14:38,707 --> 00:14:41,369
<i>...when they dropped
the evil thing on the earth.</i>

145
00:14:41,543 --> 00:14:46,706
<i>They've always sent only good things,
like rain, trees, roots and berries to eat.</i>

146
00:14:46,913 --> 00:14:53,281
<i>We are their children and they love us.
But now they've sent this evil thing. "</i>

147
00:14:57,853 --> 00:15:01,220
<i>Xi said, "The thing does not
belong on the earth.</i>

148
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:05,188
<i>Tomorrow I will take it to the end
of the earth and throw it off. "</i>

149
00:15:06,693 --> 00:15:10,491
<i>Gobo said, "I think the end of the earth
must be very far.</i>

150
00:15:10,662 --> 00:15:14,154
<i>I think you'll have to walk
for 20 days. Perhaps 40. "</i>

151
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:19,399
<i>Xi said,
"I will start walking tomorrow."</i>

152
00:15:52,692 --> 00:15:55,819
<i>Two thousand miles to the north
in the state of Birani...</i>

153
00:15:56,027 --> 00:15:58,085
<i>...trouble was brewing.</i>

154
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:06,961
It's 35 million to combat erosion
in the valley.

155
00:16:07,136 --> 00:16:11,571
- And 6 million for improvement of the...
- Hold it, minister. We can't expect...

156
00:16:49,665 --> 00:16:51,928
Get out. We need the car.

157
00:17:12,381 --> 00:17:16,406
That was Sam Boga's gang.
You said they were in Cabinda.

158
00:17:16,584 --> 00:17:19,779
- That's what I thought.
- How many got away?

159
00:17:19,952 --> 00:17:22,750
There were two jeeps.
Four got away.

160
00:17:22,922 --> 00:17:24,411
- Sam Boga was there?
- No.

161
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:30,685
This time, he's got to die.
Find him and kill him yourself.

162
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:37,454
Bring him here.

163
00:17:45,903 --> 00:17:47,962
Where is Sam Boga?

164
00:17:50,841 --> 00:17:53,309
Where is your hideout?

165
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:59,140
Bring the one in the corridor.

166
00:18:00,348 --> 00:18:01,905
Bring that one.

167
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:13,914
Where is Sam Boga?
Where is your hideout?

168
00:18:14,058 --> 00:18:15,648
Take them...

169
00:18:17,493 --> 00:18:19,825
...to the helicopter.

170
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:29,332
They went south.

171
00:18:29,502 --> 00:18:32,231
- I'll direct you from the helicopter.
- Yes, sir.

172
00:18:43,945 --> 00:18:45,571
Gas guzzler.

173
00:18:45,813 --> 00:18:48,474
<i>Four of the eight assassins
got away in two jeeps.</i>

174
00:18:48,648 --> 00:18:52,640
<i>The other four were shot in the
Cabinet room by the security guards.</i>

175
00:18:52,818 --> 00:18:55,752
<i>- Bastards.
- The assassins wore brown T-shirts...</i>

176
00:18:55,952 --> 00:18:58,182
<i>...the trademark
of the terrorist gang...</i>

177
00:18:58,355 --> 00:19:00,254
<i>...led by the notorious Sam Boga.</i>

178
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:05,948
<i>However, eyewitnesses state Sam Boga
did not take part in the assassination.</i>

179
00:19:06,093 --> 00:19:11,053
<i>It is assumed that he masterminded the
attack, some distance from the capital.</i>

180
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,664
<i>Sources announced
that the assassins killed...</i>

181
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:17,700
<i>...the ministers of education,
public works and agriculture.</i>

182
00:19:17,869 --> 00:19:22,361
<i>The president, who survived the hail
of bullets with only a flesh wound...</i>

183
00:19:22,572 --> 00:19:25,404
<i>...will be addressing the nation
in a few moments.</i>

184
00:19:31,011 --> 00:19:35,504
We did it! We did it! We got the
president, and five of his ministers!

185
00:19:35,681 --> 00:19:37,978
You didn't, you know. That's him.

186
00:19:38,116 --> 00:19:40,913
It was the will of the Almighty
that I was spared.

187
00:19:41,084 --> 00:19:43,244
We mourn the deaths
of three members...

188
00:19:43,486 --> 00:19:46,249
<i>...of my Cabinet.
We extend our deepest sympathies...</i>

189
00:19:46,421 --> 00:19:49,014
He's lying. We got six.
I saw them go down.

190
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:53,215
You killed three and wounded five.

191
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:55,856
And you lost four.

192
00:19:56,194 --> 00:19:59,788
Why do I have to work with
amateurs? Did you get away clean?

193
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:04,023
Yes, we were in and out in two
minutes. They will never find us.

194
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:28,449
Attention.

195
00:20:33,821 --> 00:20:36,914
- What happened?
- We ran out of gas.

196
00:20:37,223 --> 00:20:40,555
- How long ago?
- About 15 minutes, sir.

197
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:42,727
Okay, let's go!

198
00:20:48,565 --> 00:20:50,464
Now, you tell me.

199
00:20:52,401 --> 00:20:54,300
Where is Sam Boga?

200
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,762
Where is your hideout?

201
00:21:04,676 --> 00:21:07,405
Next time you're going
to be a bit higher.

202
00:21:07,578 --> 00:21:11,138
I'll tell you, I'll tell you!
The banana forest at Dumgaze.

203
00:21:12,349 --> 00:21:16,909
I'll tell you, I'll tell you! I'll show you.
The banana forest at Dumgaze.

204
00:21:17,186 --> 00:21:19,448
I'll tell you. I'll show you where.

205
00:21:19,654 --> 00:21:22,053
<i>- Do you hear me?
- Right here, general.</i>

206
00:21:22,189 --> 00:21:25,680
<i>- Banana forest at Dumgaze. Follow me.
- Right, general.</i>

207
00:21:25,924 --> 00:21:30,758
The man we want is the president,
not the bloody minister of education.

208
00:21:31,362 --> 00:21:35,297
Understand? I'll come with you.
We'll get him in his bed.

209
00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:38,125
Cover up! Cover up!

210
00:21:41,469 --> 00:21:45,165
Come on. Mount the bazooka.
Move it, move it!

211
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,198
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up!

212
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,701
Now take cover. You, you go there.

213
00:21:52,876 --> 00:21:55,504
Not there, you bloody fool.
Get out of there.

214
00:22:02,317 --> 00:22:05,012
- Well?
- They're there. They're there.

215
00:22:05,185 --> 00:22:08,119
You cannot see them,
but they're there.

216
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:12,286
Okay.

217
00:22:21,463 --> 00:22:23,124
You see, there they are.

218
00:22:30,136 --> 00:22:32,467
Okay. No, hold it.

219
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,547
Okay. Shit.

220
00:22:54,887 --> 00:22:56,547
Cut it out, man!

221
00:22:58,022 --> 00:22:59,421
Okay.

222
00:23:18,736 --> 00:23:21,136
- Born to be our champion.
- You showed them.

223
00:23:21,272 --> 00:23:23,136
- Beautiful, man.
- Hey.

224
00:23:23,274 --> 00:23:24,763
Quiet.

225
00:23:27,042 --> 00:23:28,736
Stand by.

226
00:23:45,254 --> 00:23:46,688
Let's go.

227
00:24:39,627 --> 00:24:43,288
<i>The most inquisitive creature
in Africa is the baboon.</i>

228
00:25:03,076 --> 00:25:05,908
<i>Xi said,
"That is a very evil thing you've got.</i>

229
00:25:06,513 --> 00:25:10,242
<i>You better give it back so I can
take it and throw it off the earth.</i>

230
00:25:10,447 --> 00:25:13,905
<i>It brought unhappiness to my family.
If you don't give it to me...</i>

231
00:25:14,084 --> 00:25:16,916
<i>...it'll bring grief to you
and your family too. "</i>

232
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,813
<i>He spoke long and earnestly until
the baboon began to pay attention.</i>

233
00:25:25,425 --> 00:25:28,359
<i>He must have convinced it,
and it dropped the thing.</i>

234
00:25:28,593 --> 00:25:31,926
<i>And Xi said,
"You have done a very wise thing."</i>

235
00:25:53,444 --> 00:25:59,813
<i>- So you want to go to Botswana?
- I want to get away from all this.</i>

236
00:25:59,982 --> 00:26:01,472
<i>But in the Kalahari?</i>

237
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:05,642
<i>Mom, it's not in the Kalahari.
Botswana isn't all desert.</i>

238
00:27:02,092 --> 00:27:08,086
Get in there. Why do they put the
nuts where you can't get at them?

239
00:27:08,297 --> 00:27:11,891
Right in my bloody face.

240
00:27:13,934 --> 00:27:17,869
Every year I have to lay here
on my back.

241
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:23,339
Keep it down a bit, Mpudi.
I'm trying to tune the scanner.

242
00:27:26,209 --> 00:27:27,903
Okay, Mpudi. Go ahead.

243
00:27:28,077 --> 00:27:32,945
Every year you come here with a bigger
and better tent and equipment.

244
00:27:33,114 --> 00:27:38,448
And every year, you turn up with this
and I have to work my ass off.

245
00:27:40,753 --> 00:27:45,245
That's funny. This elephant's dung
shows a complete lack of boron.

246
00:27:54,862 --> 00:27:57,728
Hello, Reverend.
What are you doing on a horse?

247
00:27:57,898 --> 00:28:00,890
I hit a rock with my crankcase.
Cracked it wide open.

248
00:28:01,066 --> 00:28:04,592
The trouble is, I have to meet the
new schoolteacher at Mabula.

249
00:28:04,769 --> 00:28:07,896
You can have that one,
but she's in a terrible shape.

250
00:28:08,072 --> 00:28:10,698
We've been knocking around
in the Hamadulas.

251
00:28:10,873 --> 00:28:15,900
I promised Mpudi that I'd work here,
so he could have a week to patch it.

252
00:28:16,077 --> 00:28:17,566
Here, Reverend.

253
00:28:17,745 --> 00:28:20,577
- Thank you.
- Get in there, you bloody...

254
00:28:20,747 --> 00:28:22,544
Morning, Mpudi.

255
00:28:22,982 --> 00:28:24,381
Morning, Mpudi.

256
00:28:24,583 --> 00:28:27,450
- Morning.
- Will this make it to Mabula and back?

257
00:28:27,618 --> 00:28:30,416
She's gonna be a bastard to start.
Sorry, Reverend.

258
00:28:30,588 --> 00:28:35,354
- I put in new rings and they're tight.
- But will she make it?

259
00:28:35,491 --> 00:28:37,481
You said I could have a whole week.

260
00:28:37,659 --> 00:28:42,152
This is an emergency. We want to know
if she'll make it to Mabula and back.

261
00:28:42,396 --> 00:28:45,159
I haven't looked at the brakes
or steering gear.

262
00:28:45,364 --> 00:28:47,229
- Mpudi.
- Okay, she'll make it.

263
00:28:47,566 --> 00:28:51,796
As soon as I connect the steering
rack, but she'll be a bastard to start.

264
00:28:52,002 --> 00:28:54,799
There we are, Reverend.
Then she'll be all yours.

265
00:28:55,405 --> 00:28:59,601
I don't think I can handle her.
I hear Mpudi calls her the antichrist.

266
00:28:59,808 --> 00:29:03,140
Well, she is a thing.

267
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:08,679
I was hoping...I was ho...

268
00:29:14,885 --> 00:29:18,877
- I was hoping you could go.
- I'm very awkward around women.

269
00:29:19,021 --> 00:29:21,511
- Yes, aren't we all?
- No, it's not like that.

270
00:29:21,691 --> 00:29:26,387
When I'm in the presence of a lady,
my brain switches off or something.

271
00:29:26,527 --> 00:29:29,586
- I turn into an idiot.
- You ought to meet more women.

272
00:29:29,761 --> 00:29:34,094
- It only gets worse.
- But you will do this for me?

273
00:29:43,204 --> 00:29:46,036
Come on, Prince. Come on. Go, boy.

274
00:29:46,274 --> 00:29:49,765
Come on, boy.
Come on, come on. Okay.

275
00:29:50,677 --> 00:29:52,303
Okay.

276
00:29:54,012 --> 00:29:57,708
Son of a...
Choke. Choke, choke, choke, choke.

277
00:30:01,451 --> 00:30:04,476
You tried to murder me,
you son of a...

278
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,521
Don't switch her off or let her stall.
You'll never start her.

279
00:30:08,689 --> 00:30:11,180
Don't park on a slope.
You got no hand brake.

280
00:30:11,358 --> 00:30:12,985
Now you tell me.

281
00:30:13,226 --> 00:30:14,557
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Andrew.

282
00:30:14,728 --> 00:30:17,524
- Take care, now. Goodbye.
- Bye, Mpudi.

283
00:30:27,669 --> 00:30:32,071
<i>One day, a very noisy animal rushed
past where Xi was sleeping.</i>

284
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:39,805
<i>It left very peculiar tracks, as if two
enormous snakes had slithered past.</i>

285
00:37:13,252 --> 00:37:15,345
Everybody lie down on the ground.

286
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,283
All of you, lie down!

287
00:37:18,455 --> 00:37:20,616
Come on, lie down, you and you!

288
00:37:20,791 --> 00:37:22,621
Everybody lie down!

289
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:26,753
Hey, you! Didn't you hear me?
Lie down!

290
00:37:32,465 --> 00:37:33,830
He can't hear you, sir.

291
00:37:34,034 --> 00:37:35,523
- He's deaf.
- Shut up!

292
00:38:32,308 --> 00:38:35,400
Hey, wake up!
Come and give us petrol here.

293
00:38:35,576 --> 00:38:37,168
Did two jeeps pass here?

294
00:38:37,344 --> 00:38:39,811
Yes, sir. They took half my stock.

295
00:38:39,979 --> 00:38:43,277
They took a big can of petrol,
and they made me to lie down.

296
00:38:43,415 --> 00:38:46,349
If you find them, ask them.
They must pay me my money.

297
00:38:46,517 --> 00:38:48,177
It's a lot of stuff they took.

298
00:39:01,929 --> 00:39:03,919
Morning.

299
00:39:12,702 --> 00:39:14,498
- Miss Thompson?
- Yes.

300
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:16,900
- My name...
- How do...?

301
00:39:17,072 --> 00:39:20,700
My name...My name is...

302
00:39:21,042 --> 00:39:23,339
My name...

303
00:39:35,318 --> 00:39:37,547
My name is Andrew Steyn.

304
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:39,846
How do you do?

305
00:39:40,021 --> 00:39:44,821
The Reverend cracked his crankcase,
so he asked me to...

306
00:39:57,833 --> 00:40:00,631
Thank you.

307
00:40:23,352 --> 00:40:26,286
How far do we have to go?

308
00:40:26,921 --> 00:40:29,649
How far do we have to go?

309
00:40:29,856 --> 00:40:30,914
How...?

310
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:32,557
Oh, sorry.

311
00:40:38,796 --> 00:40:39,887
Hello, Andrew.

312
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:41,552
Hello, Phineas.

313
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:44,131
- Good morning, madam.
- Good morning.

314
00:40:44,366 --> 00:40:46,766
- I'm sorry, madam. Sorry.
- It's all right.

315
00:40:46,934 --> 00:40:49,164
Here. I'm truly sorry,
madam. Sorry.

316
00:40:49,403 --> 00:40:50,734
It's all right.

317
00:40:56,308 --> 00:40:58,673
What are you doing?

318
00:41:08,416 --> 00:41:11,578
What...? What...? What are you...?
Your brakes are shot.

319
00:41:11,752 --> 00:41:13,275
- Yes.
- What are you doing?

320
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:16,618
I'm opening the gate.

321
00:41:19,958 --> 00:41:21,618
How do I get out of here?

322
00:41:21,826 --> 00:41:24,760
No, it's all right. I...

323
00:41:29,964 --> 00:41:31,192
Now I just...

324
00:41:39,472 --> 00:41:45,932
- Oh, this is too weird. I'm getting out.
- No, it's okay. I just have to...

325
00:41:47,176 --> 00:41:50,667
- What are you doing now?
- I'm closing the gate. But don't worry.

326
00:41:50,912 --> 00:41:54,347
Are you crazy? It has no brakes!
Do you wanna get me killed?

327
00:41:54,515 --> 00:41:57,608
- Are you crazy?
- All right, it'll come back.

328
00:41:57,817 --> 00:42:00,842
- What?
- The Land Rover, it'll come back.

329
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:04,420
- What do you mean, it'll come back?
- It's all right.

330
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:08,354
- I suppose you think it was funny.
- I'm sorry. The brakes don't work.

331
00:42:08,525 --> 00:42:10,823
I noticed.

332
00:42:34,043 --> 00:42:36,704
<i>Xi saw a strange-looking person,
and greeted him.</i>

333
00:42:36,879 --> 00:42:39,573
<i>But the man didn't hear him.</i>

334
00:42:46,251 --> 00:42:50,653
<i>Xi said, "This is a funny stick.
Did it grow on a tree?"</i>

335
00:43:08,267 --> 00:43:10,393
<i>He couldn't understand
why he ran away.</i>

336
00:43:10,568 --> 00:43:14,026
<i>He realized the man must've seen
the evil thing he was carrying.</i>

337
00:43:14,204 --> 00:43:15,693
<i>That's what made him run.</i>

338
00:43:35,386 --> 00:43:38,411
- She stopped.
- I noticed.

339
00:43:38,588 --> 00:43:40,851
Can you start her again?

340
00:43:41,023 --> 00:43:44,719
No. We gave her new rings,
and they're very tight.

341
00:43:45,693 --> 00:43:49,183
- How far are we from the mission?
- About 30 miles.

342
00:43:49,362 --> 00:43:51,988
- Will we get there before dark?
- I don't know.

343
00:43:52,131 --> 00:43:55,929
- This thing has stopped.
- I noticed.

344
00:43:56,099 --> 00:43:58,000
Are you sure you can't start her?

345
00:43:58,201 --> 00:44:01,260
Yes. This morning it took a horse
and three men.

346
00:44:01,437 --> 00:44:03,371
- So now what?
- I can make a fire.

347
00:44:03,538 --> 00:44:06,631
And there's some food
and a sleeping bag.

348
00:44:06,874 --> 00:44:08,034
Spend the night?

349
00:44:08,208 --> 00:44:10,142
I'm afraid so.

350
00:44:10,311 --> 00:44:12,106
You sure this thing's stopped?

351
00:44:12,277 --> 00:44:15,269
Yes. Didn't you notice?

352
00:44:18,616 --> 00:44:22,210
I can carry you across.
Then you don't have to...

353
00:44:22,385 --> 00:44:24,648
Okay.

354
00:44:32,726 --> 00:44:34,783
Watch it! Be careful!

355
00:44:36,895 --> 00:44:39,158
Thank you.

356
00:44:40,097 --> 00:44:43,827
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

357
00:44:45,634 --> 00:44:48,603
- I'm sorry.
- Look at my dress! I lost my shoes!

358
00:44:48,770 --> 00:44:51,761
- Your what?
- My shoes.

359
00:44:54,641 --> 00:44:55,665
I'm sorry.

360
00:44:55,842 --> 00:44:57,536
Well, watch it, buster.

361
00:44:59,411 --> 00:45:01,310
I'm sorry.

362
00:45:01,479 --> 00:45:04,447
- Sorry. I'll fetch your bags.
- No! You'll drop them!

363
00:45:04,615 --> 00:45:07,105
I'll get them myself.

364
00:45:08,583 --> 00:45:11,746
I'm all right. I'm okay.

365
00:45:23,662 --> 00:45:26,687
Leave that one. I don't need it.

366
00:45:37,137 --> 00:45:39,434
Idiot.

367
00:46:05,791 --> 00:46:09,953
What are you doing?
Leave me alone! Don't you dare!

368
00:46:10,494 --> 00:46:12,654
- Go away!
- It's all right. She's gone!

369
00:46:12,862 --> 00:46:15,455
Keep away! You keep away from me!

370
00:46:15,665 --> 00:46:18,132
No, I wasn't...There was this warthog.

371
00:46:18,632 --> 00:46:20,532
- What warthog?
- She's gone, but...

372
00:46:20,701 --> 00:46:22,726
Keep away.

373
00:46:22,903 --> 00:46:24,596
- I wasn't...
- Go away!

374
00:46:26,972 --> 00:46:29,133
I wasn't...

375
00:46:30,174 --> 00:46:32,335
I didn't...

376
00:46:32,542 --> 00:46:32,677
<i>Half a mile away, Xi was fixing dinner
when he was rudely interrupted.</i>

377
00:46:32,677 --> 00:46:36,372
<i>Half a mile away, Xi was fixing dinner
when he was rudely interrupted.</i>

378
00:46:39,047 --> 00:46:42,744
<i>The rhino is the self-appointed
fire-prevention officer.</i>

379
00:46:42,983 --> 00:46:47,249
<i>When he sees a fire,
he rushes in and stamps it out.</i>

380
00:47:02,063 --> 00:47:07,658
- Do you work here in Botswana?
- Yes, l...Yes. Yes.

381
00:47:07,834 --> 00:47:09,733
And what do you do?

382
00:47:09,903 --> 00:47:13,997
l...I collect manure. l...

383
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:16,503
Get away from...Get away from...

384
00:47:17,407 --> 00:47:19,898
Leave me alone!

385
00:47:46,694 --> 00:47:48,093
Miss Thompson?

386
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:52,523
Miss Thompson?

387
00:47:55,034 --> 00:47:57,024
Miss Thompson!

388
00:47:57,235 --> 00:48:01,364
Miss Thompson!
Oh, it's all right. He's gone.

389
00:48:01,538 --> 00:48:03,528
- Who's gone?
- The rhinoceros.

390
00:48:03,706 --> 00:48:05,366
What bloody rhinoceros?

391
00:48:05,874 --> 00:48:08,434
Didn't you see him?
He stamped out the fire.

392
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,610
You stamped out the fire.
I saw you.

393
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:14,177
No, he did it first.
I didn't want him to come back, so...

394
00:48:14,314 --> 00:48:16,282
- But didn't you see?
- Keep away.

395
00:48:17,682 --> 00:48:22,415
Miss Thompson, if you make a fire,
and a rhinoceros sees it...

396
00:48:22,619 --> 00:48:24,449
...he comes and stamps it out.

397
00:48:25,187 --> 00:48:28,952
Rhinos do that.
It's a most interesting phenomenon.

398
00:48:29,124 --> 00:48:32,786
You get sudden urges, and come
up with warthogs and rhinoceroses.

399
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:37,452
All right, I'll show you.
I'll make another fire.

400
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:42,460
Think I'm lying. I'll show you.

401
00:48:47,971 --> 00:48:50,939
You see how I'm making another fire?

402
00:48:51,106 --> 00:48:54,006
You'll see he'll come back.
Think I'm a liar.

403
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,414
Maybe it's too far away.

404
00:49:05,716 --> 00:49:07,342
Maybe it's upwind.

405
00:49:22,928 --> 00:49:25,226
Mr. Steyn.

406
00:49:39,873 --> 00:49:43,603
Ask them. They'll tell you
rhinoceroses always stamp out fires.

407
00:49:43,776 --> 00:49:45,539
I don't speak the language.

408
00:49:45,744 --> 00:49:48,337
Okay, I'll ask them.

409
00:49:55,018 --> 00:49:56,507
- See?
- I noticed.

410
00:49:56,684 --> 00:50:01,621
They're Tswanas. They always shake
their heads when they mean to say yes.

411
00:50:31,075 --> 00:50:33,134
What are you doing?

412
00:50:34,212 --> 00:50:36,202
I'm making coffee.

413
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:53,055
Some people didn't show
me their passports.

414
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:56,787
They smashed the barrier.
They've got guns. This is Frank.

415
00:50:56,927 --> 00:50:58,861
<i>- Were they in two jeeps?
- Yes, sir.</i>

416
00:50:59,028 --> 00:51:01,723
<i>They're being followed by
armoured cars. Can you see them?</i>

417
00:51:01,897 --> 00:51:04,229
Excuse me, sir.

418
00:51:06,934 --> 00:51:08,924
<i>- Yes, sir. I can see one.
- Stop them!</i>

419
00:51:09,102 --> 00:51:10,433
Yes, sir.

420
00:51:10,704 --> 00:51:13,069
Stop! Stop, stop, stop! Stop!

421
00:51:16,207 --> 00:51:17,901
<i>Frank?</i>

422
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:21,077
<i>Frank? Frank, what was that noise?</i>

423
00:51:21,744 --> 00:51:24,041
<i>Frank?</i>

424
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,711
I stopped them, sir.

425
00:51:26,915 --> 00:51:30,213
<i>Right. Explain that they cannot cross
our border under arms.</i>

426
00:51:30,384 --> 00:51:33,750
<i>We cannot allow them to violate
our territorial integrity.</i>

427
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,685
Request permission to cross
your border in hot pursuit of Sam Boga.

428
00:51:38,856 --> 00:51:42,518
<i>Sorry. We cannot allow an armed force
to come into Botswana.</i>

429
00:51:42,692 --> 00:51:45,387
I gotta get Sam Boga.
He shot up half our Cabinet.

430
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:49,621
<i>Our police will track him down and
hand him over to you, dead or alive.</i>

431
00:51:59,271 --> 00:52:03,138
Bye. Bye. Can't they help us?

432
00:52:03,339 --> 00:52:05,637
They'll take a message to the river.

433
00:52:05,842 --> 00:52:08,708
I think I can get the thing
out of the river.

434
00:52:08,877 --> 00:52:12,277
There's an electric winch on the front.

435
00:53:25,764 --> 00:53:27,924
Mr. Steyn?

436
00:53:28,099 --> 00:53:30,659
Mr. Steyn!

437
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:36,032
- Miss Thompson?
- Could you help me, please?

438
00:53:36,205 --> 00:53:38,434
Don't look.

439
00:53:38,606 --> 00:53:43,200
That's a watape tree. You mustn't go
near a watape tree. They grab you.

440
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:47,708
Could you hand me my gown, please?
It's in the suitcase.

441
00:53:53,918 --> 00:53:56,009
The pink one with the white edging.

442
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:08,691
Ow! Thank you.

443
00:54:11,663 --> 00:54:13,823
Sorry.

444
00:54:24,472 --> 00:54:26,735
Sorry.

445
00:54:35,079 --> 00:54:37,171
Sorry.

446
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:01,152
Thank you very much. Thank you.

447
00:55:33,353 --> 00:55:37,880
<i>That morning, Xi saw the ugliest
person he'd ever come across.</i>

448
00:55:38,257 --> 00:55:41,885
<i>She was as pale as something
that had crawled out of a rotting log.</i>

449
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:43,720
<i>Her hair was quite gruesome...</i>

450
00:55:43,894 --> 00:55:46,987
<i>...long and stringy and white,
as if she was very old.</i>

451
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:48,527
<i>She was very big.</i>

452
00:55:48,697 --> 00:55:52,996
<i>You'd have to dig the whole day
to find enough food to feed her.</i>

453
00:55:59,237 --> 00:56:01,034
Go away.

454
00:56:04,242 --> 00:56:07,074
<i>Although it was a hot day,
she was wearing skins...</i>

455
00:56:07,244 --> 00:56:10,905
<i>...that looked as if they
were made from cobwebs.</i>

456
00:56:15,048 --> 00:56:17,573
<i>She was doing strange
and magical things.</i>

457
00:56:17,751 --> 00:56:20,116
<i>It struck him that she must be
one of the gods.</i>

458
00:56:20,286 --> 00:56:22,618
<i>He wondered what she
was doing on earth.</i>

459
00:56:22,788 --> 00:56:25,778
<i>He was glad he met her.
He'd give her the evil thing...</i>

460
00:56:25,957 --> 00:56:27,924
<i>...and go home to his family.</i>

461
00:56:28,092 --> 00:56:32,424
<i>He said tactfully that he didn't need
the thing, and she could have it back.</i>

462
00:56:32,594 --> 00:56:36,325
<i>But she was very rude,
and she walked away.</i>

463
00:56:40,534 --> 00:56:43,933
- That's a Bushman. How'd he get here?
- I don't know. He's rude.

464
00:56:44,269 --> 00:56:46,828
<i>There was another god.
He had a fire inside him.</i>

465
00:56:47,038 --> 00:56:49,768
<i>The smoke came out
through his mouth and nostrils.</i>

466
00:56:50,107 --> 00:56:53,473
<i>Xi said politely, "It was kind of you
to send us this thing...</i>

467
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:56,473
<i>...but it made my family unhappy.
Please take it. "</i>

468
00:56:56,644 --> 00:56:58,805
<i>Sorry, no sabe.</i>

469
00:56:59,613 --> 00:57:01,080
Where's the truck?

470
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:18,087
I'll try and get it down.

471
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:22,787
<i>There was a peculiar sound, and Xi saw
a most amazing animal approaching.</i>

472
00:57:22,996 --> 00:57:25,463
<i>Its legs went around
instead of up and down.</i>

473
00:57:25,631 --> 00:57:28,156
<i>And there was
a weird-looking god on its back.</i>

474
00:57:28,334 --> 00:57:31,063
<i>He wore blue skin on his head
and red on his body.</i>

475
00:57:31,201 --> 00:57:33,102
<i>And hair grew on his face.</i>

476
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:37,138
What the hell happened?
Where have you been?

477
00:57:37,306 --> 00:57:39,774
<i>The funny thing was
that they couldn't speak.</i>

478
00:57:39,941 --> 00:57:41,670
<i>They made sounds like monkeys.</i>

479
00:57:41,977 --> 00:57:46,071
- Hi.
- What happened? Where's the antichrist?

480
00:57:48,982 --> 00:57:52,576
What the hell did you do that for, huh?

481
00:57:52,783 --> 00:57:55,274
I'll tell you later. Let's get it down.

482
00:57:55,452 --> 00:57:58,512
And the little Bushman?
What's he doing in these parts?

483
00:57:58,721 --> 00:58:01,815
I don't know. He was trying
to tell me something.

484
00:58:03,491 --> 00:58:06,152
- You speak Bushman?
- Yeah.

485
00:58:09,629 --> 00:58:12,222
<i>The hairy one could speak.</i>

486
00:58:17,401 --> 00:58:20,392
He says, "Thanks for the bottle,
but you can have it back."

487
00:58:20,603 --> 00:58:22,092
I didn't give it to him.

488
00:58:22,538 --> 00:58:26,473
- Well, he don't want the bottle.
- Then he'd better throw it away.

489
00:58:27,542 --> 00:58:32,136
<i>The hairy one said, "We don't want it.
You'll have to throw it away yourself. "</i>

490
00:58:32,478 --> 00:58:34,241
<i>Xi was very disappointed.</i>

491
00:58:34,413 --> 00:58:37,813
<i>It was unfair of the gods to make him
throw it off the earth.</i>

492
00:58:37,982 --> 00:58:42,884
<i>In fact, he began to doubt
whether they really were gods.</i>

493
00:58:53,927 --> 00:58:56,895
Get out! Get out!
Get out! Get in there.

494
00:58:57,062 --> 00:59:00,224
Get in there! Move it! Move it!

495
00:59:00,398 --> 00:59:04,231
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

496
00:59:30,852 --> 00:59:34,446
Yes, yes, yes. Here comes
the great white hunter to the rescue.

497
00:59:34,689 --> 00:59:36,178
Miss Thompson, I presume.

498
00:59:36,357 --> 00:59:39,847
Hello, Steyn. How would you like
to travel in style for a change?

499
00:59:40,025 --> 00:59:42,516
Yes, thank you.

500
00:59:43,661 --> 00:59:47,096
How do you open this thing?
With a can opener?

501
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:53,600
Quaint. Milady?

502
00:59:53,768 --> 00:59:57,258
- Thank you very much, Mr. Steyn, for...
- Bye-bye, Steyn.

503
00:59:57,438 --> 00:59:58,699
Goodbye, Miss Thompson.

504
00:59:58,871 --> 01:00:00,463
By the way, I am Jack Hind.

505
01:00:00,673 --> 01:00:03,698
The Reverend's worried.
He got to me on the short-wave...

506
01:00:03,875 --> 01:00:07,037
...so I offered to look for you.
That was very sweet of me.

507
01:00:07,211 --> 01:00:09,735
- It sure was.
- Would you like to sit over there?

508
01:00:09,913 --> 01:00:11,107
Sure.

509
01:00:11,281 --> 01:00:14,078
Thank you, Mr. Steyn.

510
01:00:15,049 --> 01:00:17,483
See you, Steyn. See you, Mpudi.

511
01:00:52,143 --> 01:00:54,610
I don't want to talk about it.

512
01:00:56,145 --> 01:00:59,137
She thinks I'm a lunatic,
and I don't blame her.

513
01:00:59,314 --> 01:01:04,478
You know, she asks me what do I do,
and I say I collect manure.

514
01:01:04,652 --> 01:01:07,915
I don't tell her I analyse it
for my doctoral thesis.

515
01:01:08,086 --> 01:01:11,418
I bet you she thinks I shovel the stuff.

516
01:01:14,024 --> 01:01:15,287
Was it rough?

517
01:01:15,459 --> 01:01:18,120
I'd rather not talk about it.

518
01:01:18,295 --> 01:01:19,727
That rough.

519
01:01:19,862 --> 01:01:23,024
It won't be long now,
and your suffering will be over.

520
01:01:23,298 --> 01:01:26,960
When you get there, you'll have to
stand there and look beautiful...

521
01:01:27,134 --> 01:01:30,261
...while the whole tribe sings
their welcome song at you.

522
01:01:30,469 --> 01:01:33,460
Then you can relax, have a bath
and a nice breakfast.

523
01:01:34,039 --> 01:01:37,667
Is it true that when a rhino sees a fire,
he stamps it out?

524
01:01:37,875 --> 01:01:41,934
Where did you hear that one?
Did Steyn tell you?

525
01:01:42,144 --> 01:01:43,940
Why would he tell you that?

526
01:01:44,279 --> 01:01:46,769
I'd rather not talk about it.

527
01:01:46,946 --> 01:01:50,939
- Here. This'll put hair on your chest.
- That's all I need.

528
01:01:54,752 --> 01:01:58,279
She wouldn't believe me about
the warthog and the rhinoceros.

529
01:01:58,455 --> 01:02:01,288
- What bloody rhinoceros?
- I don't want to talk about it.

530
01:02:01,458 --> 01:02:04,323
So how did this thing get up the tree?

531
01:02:04,492 --> 01:02:08,359
She got stuck in a watape tree
and I had to...

532
01:02:08,529 --> 01:02:12,055
You know she's got flowers
on her panties?

533
01:02:13,032 --> 01:02:15,397
So that's how this thing got up the tree.

534
01:02:15,635 --> 01:02:17,692
Yes.

535
01:02:57,664 --> 01:02:59,858
Don't I wave or take a bow
or something?

536
01:03:00,032 --> 01:03:01,692
No.

537
01:03:19,579 --> 01:03:22,911
<i>Notorious Communist guerrilla leader
Sam Boga and his band...</i>

538
01:03:23,081 --> 01:03:25,310
<i>...have crashed through into Botswana.</i>

539
01:03:25,449 --> 01:03:28,542
<i>- They are heading for Mozambique.
- Well, how many?</i>

540
01:03:28,718 --> 01:03:30,413
Not even 300.

541
01:03:30,587 --> 01:03:32,917
I told you bastards,
don't waste ammunition!

542
01:03:33,122 --> 01:03:35,419
Now we can't even fight back anymore.

543
01:03:35,590 --> 01:03:39,957
All of you switch your guns over
from automatic to single-fire.

544
01:03:40,394 --> 01:03:43,954
<i>Anyone withholding information
which could lead to their capture...</i>

545
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:46,756
That's automatic. That's single.

546
01:03:46,965 --> 01:03:50,331
<i>Citizens are warned that Sam Boga
is a dangerous person...</i>

547
01:03:50,466 --> 01:03:55,027
<i>...and that he and his gang
are well-armed. So it'll be unwise...</i>

548
01:03:55,204 --> 01:03:56,965
And why are you so beautiful?

549
01:03:57,138 --> 01:03:59,402
I'm going to the school
to give her these.

550
01:03:59,573 --> 01:04:01,233
You gonna look like that?

551
01:04:01,409 --> 01:04:03,137
- Like what?
- Like it's a funeral.

552
01:04:03,343 --> 01:04:05,935
You've gotta smile
and tell her she looks good.

553
01:04:06,111 --> 01:04:07,941
How are you an expert on women?

554
01:04:08,112 --> 01:04:10,137
I got seven wives. How many you got?

555
01:04:10,348 --> 01:04:13,646
- Why aren't you at home with them?
- I know how to marry them.

556
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:18,046
- Nobody knows how to live with them.
- So, what did you marry them for?

557
01:04:18,219 --> 01:04:22,847
Someday I have to tell you
the facts of life.

558
01:04:28,093 --> 01:04:31,926
"And yet we all agree
that every plate we break...

559
01:04:32,096 --> 01:04:34,724
...was cracked by Mr. Nobody.

560
01:04:34,898 --> 01:04:38,628
'Tis he who tears our books, who..."

561
01:04:56,579 --> 01:04:57,944
Come in.

562
01:04:58,448 --> 01:05:01,245
Good morning, Mr. Steyn.

563
01:05:02,616 --> 01:05:04,083
Morning, class.

564
01:05:04,686 --> 01:05:06,914
Good morning, Mr. Steyn.

565
01:05:07,621 --> 01:05:10,315
l...I brought...

566
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:37,531
Please, just leave it.

567
01:05:39,677 --> 01:05:42,975
I brought you your shoes.

568
01:05:49,416 --> 01:05:50,906
Come in.

569
01:05:57,989 --> 01:05:59,615
Come in.

570
01:06:02,793 --> 01:06:05,158
Shoe.

571
01:06:24,741 --> 01:06:27,175
You don't want to talk about it, huh?

572
01:06:30,311 --> 01:06:32,210
Shame.

573
01:06:46,991 --> 01:06:49,823
<i>The animals looked ridiculous
but good to eat...</i>

574
01:06:49,993 --> 01:06:51,323
<i>...and he was hungry.</i>

575
01:07:24,383 --> 01:07:27,250
<i>Suddenly a young boy made
chattering noises at Xi.</i>

576
01:07:27,419 --> 01:07:30,215
<i>So he said, "I shot
one of those animals.</i>

577
01:07:30,387 --> 01:07:33,878
<i>It'll go to sleep soon,
and then we can eat it. "</i>

578
01:07:34,523 --> 01:07:39,391
<i>But the boy ran away, maybe to call
his family to join in the feast.</i>

579
01:08:00,641 --> 01:08:02,074
<i>There was a weird sound...</i>

580
01:08:02,243 --> 01:08:06,041
<i>...and another of those strange animals
with the round legs appeared.</i>

581
01:08:09,614 --> 01:08:13,243
<i>The young boy and a grownup got
out of it, and seemed very excited.</i>

582
01:08:13,450 --> 01:08:16,782
<i>Xi said, "Come, sit down.
There's enough meat for all of us. "</i>

583
01:08:21,556 --> 01:08:25,013
<i>But the man was rude and greedy.
He took the whole animal.</i>

584
01:08:28,094 --> 01:08:30,118
<i>He said, "You have very bad manners.</i>

585
01:08:30,295 --> 01:08:34,287
<i>If you eat the whole thing,
I'll have to shoot another for myself. "</i>

586
01:08:37,434 --> 01:08:40,163
<i>The man shouted,
but he didn't want anything to do...</i>

587
01:08:40,336 --> 01:08:43,566
<i>...with such an uncouth person,
so he ignored him.</i>

588
01:08:44,672 --> 01:08:46,571
<i>Suddenly there was a thunderclap.</i>

589
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:50,402
<i>The animals ran away, and he ran
after them. He was very hungry.</i>

590
01:09:08,689 --> 01:09:10,246
Do you speak English?

591
01:09:10,423 --> 01:09:13,789
You are free to remain silent
until you have seen your lawyer.

592
01:09:13,959 --> 01:09:18,189
If you speak now, whatever you say will
be taken down as evidence against you.

593
01:09:35,141 --> 01:09:37,369
And why are you so beautiful?

594
01:09:37,576 --> 01:09:39,373
I got to go to court.

595
01:09:39,577 --> 01:09:41,101
What did you do?

596
01:09:41,278 --> 01:09:45,337
The cops were here. They say they
caught a little Bushman for stock theft.

597
01:09:45,981 --> 01:09:49,472
They say all he can speak is "Xixo,"
so they want me to interpret.

598
01:09:49,651 --> 01:09:49,817
Xixo.

599
01:09:49,817 --> 01:09:53,082
Xixo.

600
01:09:56,789 --> 01:09:59,848
<i>They brought Xi into a place
with several people.</i>

601
01:10:00,026 --> 01:10:03,892
<i>He smiled at them in greeting,
but nobody smiled back.</i>

602
01:10:14,502 --> 01:10:16,470
Interpreter.

603
01:10:23,841 --> 01:10:28,106
You, Xixo, are hereby charged with
wrongfully and unlawfully slaughtering...

604
01:10:28,245 --> 01:10:32,703
...one goat on the 21st of September,
1980, in Oniamatokwe.

605
01:10:32,914 --> 01:10:35,643
How plead you?
Guilty or not guilty?

606
01:10:36,483 --> 01:10:39,645
<i>Mpudi found it difficult to interpret
because, in his language...</i>

607
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:41,843
<i>...there was no word for "guilty."</i>

608
01:10:44,556 --> 01:10:47,888
Finally he asked,
"Did you shoot an animal?"

609
01:10:48,058 --> 01:10:52,926
<i>Xi said, "Yes, I did, but that man took it.
He did not want to share it with me. "</i>

610
01:10:53,162 --> 01:10:56,562
- Well, what does he plead?
- Not guilty.

611
01:10:56,731 --> 01:11:01,167
- They gave him the death sentence.
- For killing a goat? No.

612
01:11:01,334 --> 01:11:06,269
Three months in jail, same thing.
He gonna die for sure.

613
01:11:06,504 --> 01:11:09,563
He never seen a wall.
Now, he got walls all around him.

614
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:11,866
But didn't you explain to them?

615
01:11:12,042 --> 01:11:16,272
- They said, "Silence in court."
- Yeah, but surely they ought to know.

616
01:11:17,279 --> 01:11:19,906
Nobody knows the Bushmen.

617
01:11:20,680 --> 01:11:23,047
Nobody ever goes
into the deep Kalahari.

618
01:11:23,216 --> 01:11:25,843
How come you know so much
about them?

619
01:11:26,018 --> 01:11:30,716
When Botswana belonged to the British,
I hit a policeman for insulting my father.

620
01:11:30,888 --> 01:11:33,947
So I fled, right into the Kalahari.

621
01:11:34,157 --> 01:11:36,852
I died, you know. Dehydration.

622
01:11:37,026 --> 01:11:39,858
Some of those little buggers
found me, and buried me.

623
01:11:40,028 --> 01:11:41,358
Only my head stuck out.

624
01:11:41,528 --> 01:11:44,725
For two weeks, they pushed water
and food into my mouth.

625
01:11:44,898 --> 01:11:47,296
And when they dug me up,
I was nearly white.

626
01:11:47,466 --> 01:11:48,797
Like you.

627
01:11:49,102 --> 01:11:53,537
I lived with them for three years.
They're the sweetest little buggers.

628
01:11:53,704 --> 01:11:56,035
He gonna die for sure.

629
01:12:08,314 --> 01:12:11,112
Can I go to Mahadi tomorrow?

630
01:12:11,283 --> 01:12:13,750
You wanna go and see
little what's his name?

631
01:12:13,918 --> 01:12:16,112
I want to get him out.

632
01:12:16,286 --> 01:12:18,310
Now, don't do anything silly.

633
01:12:18,488 --> 01:12:20,581
They got to let him out.

634
01:12:21,690 --> 01:12:24,124
Maybe if we explain to them.

635
01:12:24,626 --> 01:12:27,889
- You coming too?
- Yes.

636
01:12:48,275 --> 01:12:51,402
Says he's sorry.
He try to eat the food tomorrow.

637
01:12:51,577 --> 01:12:55,479
- Has he eaten anything? It's been a week.
- No.

638
01:12:58,349 --> 01:13:00,908
Of course we're worried.
We can't force-feed him.

639
01:13:01,084 --> 01:13:03,916
- You've got to let him out.
- He's got 11 weeks to go.

640
01:13:04,086 --> 01:13:07,817
Well, is there no way?
Can't we buy him out or something?

641
01:13:07,990 --> 01:13:11,515
Well, if somebody wants to employ
him as a convict-labourer.

642
01:13:11,725 --> 01:13:14,250
But he has no experience,
no qualifications.

643
01:13:14,426 --> 01:13:16,155
He got qualifications.

644
01:13:16,328 --> 01:13:19,353
He can teach you things
about plants and animals.

645
01:13:19,532 --> 01:13:23,761
Yes. We want to employ him
as an ecological expert.

646
01:13:33,107 --> 01:13:35,870
He will have to remain in your employ
for the full 11 weeks.

647
01:13:36,042 --> 01:13:39,738
If he leaves, we will hunt him down
and lock him up for a long time.

648
01:13:39,878 --> 01:13:41,640
Okay, thanks.

649
01:13:57,157 --> 01:13:59,021
We can't put him inside.

650
01:13:59,192 --> 01:14:00,853
No, you're right.

651
01:14:45,357 --> 01:14:48,884
I understand the words,
but the meaning...

652
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:53,358
Talks about a bad thing,
an evil thing.

653
01:14:53,529 --> 01:14:55,588
And about the end of the world.

654
01:14:55,798 --> 01:15:00,063
Well, explain to him he has
to stay with us for the full 11 weeks.

655
01:15:00,235 --> 01:15:04,431
- He doesn't know from weeks.
- We'll tell him when it's okay to go.

656
01:15:12,243 --> 01:15:14,733
- Hello, Andrew. Mpudi.
- Hello, Jack.

657
01:15:14,912 --> 01:15:17,004
I hear a Bushman's working for you.

658
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:19,204
Yeah, his name is Xi.

659
01:15:19,381 --> 01:15:22,076
- Are they good trackers?
- Best in the world.

660
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:23,615
Mind if I borrow him?

661
01:15:23,817 --> 01:15:26,547
One of my guests wounded a cougar.
My trackers can't find it.

662
01:15:33,391 --> 01:15:35,449
This is where we lost him.

663
01:15:56,407 --> 01:15:58,704
You'll see, he'll find him.

664
01:16:12,451 --> 01:16:14,748
Hey! Hey!

665
01:16:29,063 --> 01:16:30,997
Scram, go away!

666
01:16:32,265 --> 01:16:33,663
Get!

667
01:16:37,635 --> 01:16:39,125
Go away!

668
01:16:52,513 --> 01:16:56,744
- I'm sorry, I didn't realise...
- I don't want to talk about it.

669
01:17:07,824 --> 01:17:09,381
What do you want?

670
01:17:10,591 --> 01:17:13,457
Hurry up. Hurry up.
Get them out.

671
01:17:14,628 --> 01:17:16,892
Come on. Get him.
Hurry up, man.

672
01:17:29,772 --> 01:17:31,966
You can drop those guns.

673
01:17:39,913 --> 01:17:41,312
Bastard.

674
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:43,409
You want me to let fly?

675
01:17:47,017 --> 01:17:50,110
Now get out.
With your hands up.

676
01:17:56,291 --> 01:17:58,121
Bring out all the kids.

677
01:18:01,494 --> 01:18:04,792
Sergeant, I'm going to walk due east
from here to Motambe...

678
01:18:04,997 --> 01:18:07,192
...and I'm taking
all these kids with me.

679
01:18:07,365 --> 01:18:10,527
If I see one truck or one aeroplane
or one policeman...

680
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:13,190
...or one soldier or one person...

681
01:18:13,370 --> 01:18:15,929
...we'll mow these kids down.

682
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:18,334
- Have you got shortwave in there?
- Yes.

683
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:24,300
Now get on to headquarters, and tell them
I want a corridor 10 miles wide.

684
01:18:24,477 --> 01:18:28,138
The army and the police
better clear out everybody.

685
01:18:28,313 --> 01:18:31,679
And they've got to put down food
and water every 20 miles.

686
01:18:31,849 --> 01:18:36,011
And then get the hell out of the way
before we get there. Tell them that.

687
01:18:37,386 --> 01:18:41,321
All right, get them into a circle.
I want a big circle around me.

688
01:18:41,489 --> 01:18:44,946
Leave the small ones. It's miles
to Motambe. They'll never make it.

689
01:18:49,094 --> 01:18:50,526
Okay, now buzz off.

690
01:18:50,696 --> 01:18:52,685
Clear out the people from this end...

691
01:18:52,864 --> 01:18:55,991
...because I want to start marching
in two hours.

692
01:18:59,401 --> 01:19:02,666
And I warn you,
you better clear out everybody.

693
01:19:07,006 --> 01:19:08,473
Clutch.

694
01:19:13,912 --> 01:19:15,707
Brake. Brake.

695
01:19:16,747 --> 01:19:18,771
Clutch. Clutch!

696
01:19:23,017 --> 01:19:25,746
I'm teaching him to drive.
Just for the hell of it.

697
01:19:25,919 --> 01:19:28,386
Nothing else to do around here anyhow.

698
01:19:28,555 --> 01:19:31,580
- Still mooning about the schoolmarm?
- Sort of.

699
01:19:31,757 --> 01:19:35,123
I want to move up to Nioko for a
few days so we can do a game count.

700
01:19:35,293 --> 01:19:38,749
- How will this get us through the jungle?
- We strip it down.

701
01:19:54,306 --> 01:19:57,035
Come on, Xi. Come on!

702
01:20:01,745 --> 01:20:03,803
He don't know from doors.

703
01:20:39,838 --> 01:20:42,169
Stop playing that bloody game.

704
01:20:42,340 --> 01:20:44,637
Okay, it's time. Let's go.
Move them.

705
01:20:44,808 --> 01:20:46,173
Come on. Everybody up.

706
01:20:46,343 --> 01:20:49,310
Come on, let's go.
Keep them going.

707
01:20:49,478 --> 01:20:51,275
Keep them in a circle around me.

708
01:20:51,446 --> 01:20:53,936
Move them!
Don't leave any stragglers.

709
01:20:54,315 --> 01:20:56,475
- Keep your paws to yourself!
- Shut up.

710
01:20:57,917 --> 01:21:00,407
Get them into a circle.
A circle, a circle!

711
01:21:02,254 --> 01:21:05,188
- Stop yelling at them.
- That's not a bloody circle.

712
01:21:05,356 --> 01:21:07,915
- Can't you do anything right?
- I can't get them into a circle.

713
01:21:08,091 --> 01:21:09,819
They keep coming up in a square.

714
01:21:09,992 --> 01:21:12,688
Then, make it a square.
Let them walk in a square.

715
01:21:12,862 --> 01:21:15,796
Keep them going.
Don't let them straggle.

716
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:19,162
Who says they'll come this way?

717
01:21:19,499 --> 01:21:22,797
He says he wants a corridor
10 miles wide.

718
01:21:23,068 --> 01:21:27,697
I'm sorry. We'll have to get out of the way
for now until he passes this point.

719
01:21:27,872 --> 01:21:29,805
Where can I find Andrew Steyn?

720
01:21:29,974 --> 01:21:32,806
You'd better warn him too.
He's five miles that way.

721
01:21:32,976 --> 01:21:34,442
You turn right at the...

722
01:21:34,610 --> 01:21:36,600
Damn it, I'll come and show you.

723
01:21:37,477 --> 01:21:39,969
Johnny, will you take them to Machadi?

724
01:21:56,158 --> 01:22:00,184
Tell them to sing.
Come on, everybody. Sing, sing!

725
01:23:24,353 --> 01:23:25,718
Wouldn't you know?

726
01:23:25,887 --> 01:23:27,445
Now where do we find him?

727
01:23:32,759 --> 01:23:34,658
They left this morning.

728
01:23:35,927 --> 01:23:37,394
Come on!

729
01:24:06,249 --> 01:24:07,715
They went through.

730
01:24:07,883 --> 01:24:09,816
They'll meet up with Boga for sure.

731
01:24:09,985 --> 01:24:13,613
- Is there a way around this?
- It's a hell of a long way.

732
01:24:13,787 --> 01:24:15,482
Well, let's go.

733
01:24:47,310 --> 01:24:48,800
Mpudi.

734
01:25:07,725 --> 01:25:13,252
One, two, three, four, five...

735
01:25:13,429 --> 01:25:15,521
...six adult oryx.

736
01:25:19,533 --> 01:25:22,365
He says there are people
things down there.

737
01:25:22,535 --> 01:25:24,594
- Where?
- Down there.

738
01:25:35,344 --> 01:25:37,811
Army truck. Unloading something.

739
01:25:39,881 --> 01:25:41,974
I wonder what they're up to.

740
01:25:45,284 --> 01:25:48,651
Looks like food.
Cooking pots and stuff.

741
01:25:49,287 --> 01:25:50,878
Maybe it's a picnic.

742
01:25:52,556 --> 01:25:54,387
Funny. They're going away.

743
01:25:56,859 --> 01:26:01,294
- They went away and left their stuff.
- Yeah, funny.

744
01:26:04,130 --> 01:26:05,154
Oh, well.

745
01:26:05,332 --> 01:26:07,857
One, two, three, four, five, six...

746
01:26:29,048 --> 01:26:31,015
You've got to let them rest.

747
01:26:31,183 --> 01:26:33,673
The smaller ones can't keep up.

748
01:26:33,852 --> 01:26:36,012
They can rest
when they get to the food.

749
01:26:36,186 --> 01:26:39,485
- You're driving them too hard.
- It's a long way to Motambe.

750
01:26:39,656 --> 01:26:42,818
You said 20 miles.
They can't walk 20 miles without eating.

751
01:26:42,991 --> 01:26:44,423
Halt!

752
01:26:52,198 --> 01:26:53,893
Look at that!

753
01:26:54,066 --> 01:26:57,933
I told you,
stop playing that bloody game!

754
01:27:02,438 --> 01:27:04,929
You've got to let
the little ones turn back.

755
01:27:05,107 --> 01:27:06,937
Nobody turns back.

756
01:27:07,108 --> 01:27:10,702
Next thing,
everybody's gonna get sore feet.

757
01:27:10,877 --> 01:27:13,709
Next one drops out, I shoot him!

758
01:27:14,079 --> 01:27:17,741
You, you, help her.
If you got to carry her, carry her.

759
01:27:18,249 --> 01:27:21,911
If I catch you playing again,
by God...

760
01:27:22,419 --> 01:27:23,943
March!

761
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:27,112
They can't march 20 miles.
They're not soldiers!

762
01:27:27,322 --> 01:27:31,053
If they want to eat,
they'd better march 20 miles!

763
01:27:31,226 --> 01:27:36,594
Are you scared it'll spoil your image
if you admit you made a mistake?

764
01:27:37,929 --> 01:27:40,396
Halt!

765
01:27:47,103 --> 01:27:49,570
You! Come here!

766
01:27:55,142 --> 01:27:57,701
See that hill over there?

767
01:27:58,210 --> 01:28:01,975
Go to the top, and wave this thing
until the army people see you.

768
01:28:02,147 --> 01:28:08,278
Then you go down to them, and
tell them Sam Boga made a mistake.

769
01:28:11,953 --> 01:28:14,978
Now I want them to leave food
every 10 miles.

770
01:28:15,156 --> 01:28:16,884
- Understand?
- Yes.

771
01:28:17,056 --> 01:28:19,047
Now, get going. Move!

772
01:28:23,094 --> 01:28:25,153
March!

773
01:28:25,363 --> 01:28:27,592
One ostrich and four, five...

774
01:28:27,764 --> 01:28:30,357
...six, seven, eight...

775
01:28:41,074 --> 01:28:44,474
A lot of children. The food
must have been left there for them.

776
01:28:44,644 --> 01:28:47,076
- What the hell? They've got guns.
- The kids?

777
01:28:47,244 --> 01:28:51,509
No. There are men down there
with guns. It's no picnic.

778
01:28:51,981 --> 01:28:54,245
I think those kids are hostages.

779
01:28:54,417 --> 01:28:57,111
What was that on the news
about Sam Boga?

780
01:29:02,255 --> 01:29:06,451
That man said I must go to the top,
and I must wave my conga.

781
01:29:12,796 --> 01:29:14,786
So Miss Kate said 20 miles
is too much.

782
01:29:14,964 --> 01:29:17,296
- Is she down there?
- Yes.

783
01:29:28,674 --> 01:29:30,937
We'll have to immobilise them.

784
01:29:31,542 --> 01:29:34,408
- Are Bushmen good stalkers?
- Best in the world.

785
01:29:34,544 --> 01:29:36,478
Let him have a look at them.

786
01:29:43,685 --> 01:29:45,049
All right.

787
01:29:45,219 --> 01:29:50,120
Explain to him that the men with the guns
are bad. We have to put them to sleep.

788
01:29:56,359 --> 01:29:59,123
He want to know how did
those people get in there?

789
01:29:59,295 --> 01:30:01,956
No, no, they're not...

790
01:30:02,998 --> 01:30:04,487
You explain.

791
01:30:04,665 --> 01:30:06,656
One hour, then we move!

792
01:30:06,834 --> 01:30:09,062
I'm gonna have a snooze.

793
01:30:33,952 --> 01:30:35,249
"Dear Miss Thompson:

794
01:30:35,454 --> 01:30:39,980
Your abductors have been injected
with an immobiliser.

795
01:30:40,491 --> 01:30:43,720
When they go to sleep,
you must disarm them."

796
01:30:44,593 --> 01:30:48,255
Tell him he must give her the note
only after he's shot all the men.

797
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:55,827
When he shoots, he must
pull back on the thread quickly...

798
01:30:56,002 --> 01:30:59,994
...so the man can think it was a horsefly
or a wasp that stung him.

799
01:31:09,777 --> 01:31:11,608
He's fast. It'll work.

800
01:31:11,778 --> 01:31:14,474
He must dip the needle each time.

801
01:31:49,538 --> 01:31:52,005
I can't see the little bugger.

802
01:31:52,273 --> 01:31:54,070
Yeah, I see him.

803
01:32:13,522 --> 01:32:14,954
Now, look at that.

804
01:32:15,590 --> 01:32:17,615
Yeah, he's clever.

805
01:33:23,504 --> 01:33:25,368
Nothing's happening down there.

806
01:33:25,572 --> 01:33:27,369
It takes time.

807
01:33:33,479 --> 01:33:35,309
Who are you?

808
01:34:18,610 --> 01:34:22,374
Some of those guys are down.
She'll need help when they wake up.

809
01:34:24,413 --> 01:34:27,974
Hey, wake up, man.
You gotta wake up.

810
01:34:28,150 --> 01:34:31,915
Come on, you can't sleep now.
Come on.

811
01:34:55,936 --> 01:34:58,732
We need some rope.
There's plenty in the Land Rover.

812
01:34:58,904 --> 01:35:01,634
He can fetch it.
I didn't teach him for nothing.

813
01:35:06,776 --> 01:35:09,005
Says he don't understand the gears.

814
01:35:10,778 --> 01:35:13,679
- Told him he can drive in any gear.
- Let's go!

815
01:35:13,848 --> 01:35:15,543
And you take that one.

816
01:35:15,716 --> 01:35:17,945
And you, that one.

817
01:35:18,151 --> 01:35:19,174
And I'll take...

818
01:35:20,886 --> 01:35:23,353
There's only six.
There should be eight.

819
01:35:32,461 --> 01:35:35,726
Maybe they're asleep as well.
I don't know.

820
01:35:39,567 --> 01:35:40,964
All right.

821
01:35:41,400 --> 01:35:44,528
I want you to circulate
among the children.

822
01:35:44,702 --> 01:35:48,228
Quietly. And tell them that
when we grab the guns...

823
01:35:48,406 --> 01:35:52,067
...they must run fast into that crevice
behind us and take cover.

824
01:35:52,241 --> 01:35:54,402
Okay? Good.

825
01:36:06,451 --> 01:36:09,284
Ready? Go!

826
01:36:15,557 --> 01:36:17,047
Come on!

827
01:36:25,064 --> 01:36:27,259
No! Get down, get down!

828
01:36:28,233 --> 01:36:29,996
And stay there!

829
01:36:34,437 --> 01:36:36,428
Get back! All of you!

830
01:36:38,507 --> 01:36:40,236
- Hey, watch it!
- Sorry.

831
01:36:52,083 --> 01:36:56,416
We've got to outflank them.
You go around. I'll keep you covered.

832
01:37:18,168 --> 01:37:20,159
Get back! Get back!

833
01:37:21,037 --> 01:37:22,799
Hurry up!

834
01:37:35,047 --> 01:37:36,536
- You okay?
- Yep.

835
01:37:36,748 --> 01:37:38,510
- Who are they shooting at?
- I don't know.

836
01:37:43,285 --> 01:37:45,515
Four, five, six.

837
01:37:45,687 --> 01:37:47,051
Two are missing.

838
01:37:47,255 --> 01:37:49,950
This one here, and I heard
shots from over there.

839
01:37:59,530 --> 01:38:00,554
Look.

840
01:38:16,809 --> 01:38:18,469
Roll over.

841
01:38:20,278 --> 01:38:22,006
Mpudi, hold him.

842
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:50,540
What's happened?

843
01:39:50,974 --> 01:39:52,941
Have you got water in there?

844
01:39:53,377 --> 01:39:55,105
Hold these for me.

845
01:39:59,848 --> 01:40:02,644
- Get up.
- But what happened, man?

846
01:40:02,850 --> 01:40:04,749
Oh, it's a long story.

847
01:40:05,251 --> 01:40:08,083
What happened to those guys?
Are they all dead?

848
01:40:09,754 --> 01:40:11,120
Did you kill them?

849
01:40:11,289 --> 01:40:12,916
They've been immobilised.

850
01:40:13,457 --> 01:40:15,356
Where's Kate and the kids?

851
01:40:15,492 --> 01:40:18,255
They're hiding back there.
They can come out now.

852
01:40:18,427 --> 01:40:20,088
Oh, my God. Mpudi.

853
01:40:21,863 --> 01:40:23,922
Keep that guy covered.

854
01:40:30,969 --> 01:40:35,268
Kate! It's okay.
You can come out now!

855
01:40:38,740 --> 01:40:41,573
We've got everything under control.
You can come out!

856
01:40:41,743 --> 01:40:44,734
- Jack?
- Hi there. The marines have landed.

857
01:40:44,912 --> 01:40:47,244
It's okay. You can all come out.

858
01:40:48,181 --> 01:40:50,741
All right, come on. Come on.

859
01:41:07,162 --> 01:41:08,185
You're safe now.

860
01:41:08,395 --> 01:41:12,330
Better collect those men before
they wake up. You were right.

861
01:41:12,497 --> 01:41:15,489
- Did you fix him good?
- Yeah, get up.

862
01:41:17,268 --> 01:41:18,895
Walk.

863
01:41:28,276 --> 01:41:30,800
Boy, you had a tough time, huh?

864
01:41:31,545 --> 01:41:32,603
Watch out!

865
01:41:32,778 --> 01:41:34,405
Stop fooling around, Steyn.

866
01:41:35,548 --> 01:41:37,606
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

867
01:41:54,661 --> 01:41:56,150
I'm sorry.

868
01:41:56,329 --> 01:41:58,796
It's all right, Steyn. Move.

869
01:42:07,436 --> 01:42:09,300
Milady.

870
01:42:11,139 --> 01:42:15,131
Sergeant, get on the radio and organise
some buses to take the kids home.

871
01:42:15,675 --> 01:42:17,871
How come suddenly he the big hero?

872
01:42:19,012 --> 01:42:21,808
We'd better get back to our equipment.

873
01:42:32,687 --> 01:42:35,952
Says thank you, goodbye and
hopes you have lots of children.

874
01:42:36,089 --> 01:42:38,853
- Tell him thanks. I'll miss him.
- He can't use that.

875
01:42:39,026 --> 01:42:41,357
- I have to...
- Bushmen don't know about money.

876
01:42:41,660 --> 01:42:44,651
- What can I give him?
- There's nothing here he can use.

877
01:42:44,828 --> 01:42:48,662
- Bushmen don't need things.
- He's gotta take the money. It's the law.

878
01:42:55,771 --> 01:42:58,738
He's going the wrong way.
The Kalahari's that way.

879
01:43:02,207 --> 01:43:05,040
Says he got to find the
evil thing and get rid of it.

880
01:43:05,344 --> 01:43:07,004
I don't know.

881
01:43:07,879 --> 01:43:11,507
- I'm going to miss the little bugger.
- Yeah, me too.

882
01:43:11,681 --> 01:43:14,171
- You gonna look like that forever?
- Like what?

883
01:43:14,350 --> 01:43:16,340
Like Jack Hind is better than you.

884
01:43:16,519 --> 01:43:19,919
- No, I'm going to talk to her.
- Tell her you were the big hero.

885
01:43:20,087 --> 01:43:21,714
No, I can't do that.

886
01:43:21,922 --> 01:43:24,082
But I do want to talk to her.

887
01:43:24,290 --> 01:43:25,847
I'll tell her...

888
01:43:26,258 --> 01:43:29,124
I'll say, "Look, Miss Thompson...

889
01:43:29,560 --> 01:43:31,494
...I know you think I'm an idiot...

890
01:43:31,629 --> 01:43:33,892
...but normally I'm quite normal.

891
01:43:34,064 --> 01:43:37,056
It's only when I'm in the presence
of a lady that I...

892
01:43:37,232 --> 01:43:40,723
It's really just an interesting
psychological phenomenon.

893
01:43:40,902 --> 01:43:45,564
If a man who is susceptible to a type
of para-Freudian syndrome like this...

894
01:43:45,772 --> 01:43:48,239
...encounters a nubile
female, what happens?"

895
01:43:48,874 --> 01:43:51,273
I suppose another big word happens.

896
01:43:51,876 --> 01:43:54,867
- Too erudite?
- Yeah, whatever that means.

897
01:43:55,112 --> 01:43:57,875
Okay. I'll put it more simply. I'll say:

898
01:43:58,748 --> 01:44:00,544
"Look, Miss Thompson.

899
01:44:01,283 --> 01:44:04,080
Kate. Kate.

900
01:44:04,318 --> 01:44:07,616
It's really only an interesting
psychological phenomenon."

901
01:44:07,787 --> 01:44:10,584
She'll understand that bit.
She's a schoolteacher.

902
01:44:10,789 --> 01:44:13,655
I'll say, "When there's no lady present...

903
01:44:13,825 --> 01:44:16,259
...I can catch an insect
without hurting it."

904
01:44:16,427 --> 01:44:19,417
If she knew me better, she'd
see I'm not a stumblebum.

905
01:44:19,595 --> 01:44:24,122
- All I need is a little practise. If I...
- Wait for me. You need moral support.

906
01:44:45,147 --> 01:44:46,614
There she is.

907
01:44:50,851 --> 01:44:53,842
You better do your thing
before the pupils come.

908
01:44:54,153 --> 01:44:55,677
Yeah.

909
01:45:02,059 --> 01:45:03,548
Morning.

910
01:45:04,359 --> 01:45:06,122
Morning, Miss Thompson.

911
01:45:06,495 --> 01:45:08,121
Morning.

912
01:45:08,363 --> 01:45:10,592
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks. How are you?

913
01:45:10,764 --> 01:45:12,458
Fine, thanks, and how are you?

914
01:45:13,433 --> 01:45:15,196
I'm fine, thank you.

915
01:45:18,103 --> 01:45:19,797
Kate...

916
01:45:20,072 --> 01:45:22,334
...I know you think I'm an idiot...

917
01:45:22,572 --> 01:45:25,335
...but I'm not really like that. It's...

918
01:45:25,608 --> 01:45:27,575
...only when I'm around wom...

919
01:45:28,644 --> 01:45:31,009
Around you. I'm sorry.

920
01:45:31,646 --> 01:45:34,078
Normally, I'm quite normal.

921
01:45:34,281 --> 01:45:37,147
But whenever I'm
in the presence of a lady...

922
01:45:37,316 --> 01:45:42,513
...my fingers turn into thumbs,
my brain switches off.

923
01:45:43,087 --> 01:45:44,486
Watch it!

924
01:45:49,091 --> 01:45:50,456
It's flour.

925
01:45:50,659 --> 01:45:52,091
I noticed.

926
01:45:52,794 --> 01:45:54,657
It's actually...

927
01:45:58,999 --> 01:46:03,696
Actually, it's really only an interesting
psychological phenomenon.

928
01:46:03,868 --> 01:46:06,700
Perhaps it's some Freudian syndrome.

929
01:46:07,237 --> 01:46:10,103
When I brought you your shoes,
I came to apologise...

930
01:46:10,239 --> 01:46:13,366
...for the stupid things I did
when I met you at Mabula.

931
01:46:13,608 --> 01:46:16,098
To explain that I'm not as stupid as that.

932
01:46:16,343 --> 01:46:18,607
But then, of course, I blew it, and I...

933
01:46:18,846 --> 01:46:21,507
So I don't blame you if you think...

934
01:46:21,881 --> 01:46:25,212
But it's really only an
interesting psychological...

935
01:46:27,185 --> 01:46:31,678
When you get to know me better, you'll
see that I'm not always stumbling.

936
01:46:38,860 --> 01:46:42,260
It's really just an interesting
psychological phenomenon.

937
01:46:42,428 --> 01:46:46,022
Yes, you are a very interesting
psychological phenomenon.

938
01:46:46,199 --> 01:46:48,131
And I think you're very sweet.

939
01:47:18,020 --> 01:47:21,419
<i>Xi was beginning to think he'd
never find the end of the earth.</i>

940
01:47:21,589 --> 01:47:24,364
<i>And one day, suddenly, there it was.</i>
