154
00:07:38,641 --> 00:07:40,233
Jimmy.

155
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,199
What the fuck?

156
00:08:20,883 --> 00:08:23,181
<i>They entered a tenement</i>
<i>at 186th and Audubon.</i>

157
00:08:23,352 --> 00:08:25,843
<i>For the purpose of?</i>
- <i>Responding to shots fired.</i>

158
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:29,721
Two were DOA at the scene,
Officer Cavanaugh pronounced en route.

159
00:08:29,892 --> 00:08:31,985
My last guy Lonnie Mercer's
up in surgery now.

160
00:08:32,161 --> 00:08:34,186
All right. Where are we on task force?

161
00:08:34,363 --> 00:08:36,228
Being assembled. Smitty's on point.

162
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,026
All right. I want the best men available.

163
00:08:38,201 --> 00:08:42,297
The severity of the situation
is such I want cops we can trust.

164
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:50,777
Don't beat yourself up here, Franny.
There's no blame in this.

165
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,609
There's not a goddamned thing
any one of us could've done.

166
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,577
My cops, my command, Pop.

167
00:08:55,751 --> 00:08:59,050
We lose officers in the line, Francis.
It's not your fault.

168
00:08:59,222 --> 00:09:03,022
Forty years wading through shit like this,
watching our guys die.

169
00:09:03,192 --> 00:09:04,284
You keep the rage.

170
00:09:05,094 --> 00:09:07,460
You cut the rest of it loose.

171
00:09:26,515 --> 00:09:27,539
Any word?

172
00:09:33,689 --> 00:09:34,951
Pop's here.

173
00:09:35,124 --> 00:09:37,957
<i>Dr. King, please call the operating room.</i>

174
00:09:38,728 --> 00:09:39,786
Excuse me.
- I'm sorry...

175
00:09:39,962 --> 00:09:42,396
Let me go! I wanna see
my fucking husband.

176
00:09:42,565 --> 00:09:45,295
I can't let you back here.
There's nothing I can do.

177
00:09:45,468 --> 00:09:47,265
I wanna see my fucking husband!

178
00:09:47,436 --> 00:09:50,234
Trish.
- I wanna see my fucking husband!

179
00:09:50,406 --> 00:09:53,273
I wanna see his face.

180
00:09:53,442 --> 00:09:55,501
I'm sorry, Trish. I'm so sorry.

181
00:09:57,346 --> 00:10:00,406
Oh, my God.

182
00:10:33,949 --> 00:10:35,541
Hey, kiddo.

183
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,015
Hey, Pop.

184
00:10:37,186 --> 00:10:39,086
Hell of a thing, huh?

185
00:10:43,859 --> 00:10:45,588
Good you came.

186
00:10:46,128 --> 00:10:47,993
You were there for Lonnie at least, huh?

187
00:10:48,798 --> 00:10:50,231
Yeah.

188
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,768
I sat down with Bill Avery and Armstrong.
We're gearing up task force.

189
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:59,235
Yeah, well, everyone's gonna
want in on that.

190
00:10:59,675 --> 00:11:01,302
You're gonna get all the oranges.

191
00:11:01,477 --> 00:11:04,241
How about you throw your hat in the ring?
Make a phone call.

192
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,812
Me?

193
00:11:08,117 --> 00:11:10,244
No. No, definitely not.

194
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,387
Don't you think it's time you got back...

195
00:11:12,555 --> 00:11:15,217
...after two years on the tit
feeling sorry for yourself?

196
00:11:15,391 --> 00:11:17,951
I don't feel sorry for myself.
I'm just not up for that.

197
00:11:18,127 --> 00:11:21,927
How about Lonnie? You feel sorry for him?
His wife, his kids?

198
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:25,295
- You guys came up together.
- Oh, come on. Don't lay that on me, okay?

199
00:11:25,468 --> 00:11:27,800
- If it was you, he'd be all over this.
- Yeah.

200
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,200
- Be the first one signing up.
- I know that.

201
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:35,003
Not a goddamn thing I can do
for Lonnie now, Pop.

202
00:11:35,177 --> 00:11:37,372
I held his hand
in the back of that ambulance...

203
00:11:37,546 --> 00:11:39,707
...and even that didn't do any good.

204
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:43,274
He died looking into the face
of a friend, Raymond.

205
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,079
Yeah.

206
00:11:49,658 --> 00:11:52,593
You're too smart not to know
that you're wasting your talent...

207
00:11:52,762 --> 00:11:54,286
...in goddamn Missing Persons.

208
00:11:54,463 --> 00:12:00,026
- For you, it's a fucking dumping ground.
- Yeah, well, it doesn't bother me.

209
00:12:00,202 --> 00:12:01,931
It bothers you.

210
00:12:03,172 --> 00:12:04,639
Yeah, look.

211
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,468
Pop, it's been a shitty night, okay?

212
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,837
I just wanna get out
of these fucking clothes...

213
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:11,070
...and wash this whole day off.
I'll see you.

214
00:12:11,247 --> 00:12:13,238
Don't turn your back on me, Raymond.

215
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:17,546
You're my kid, my blood, but you
might as well be a fucking Martian.

216
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,678
Okay.

217
00:12:20,923 --> 00:12:23,892
I'm gonna say what I'm gonna say,
and then I'm out of here.

218
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:26,755
I'm walking out, and it's over.

219
00:12:27,596 --> 00:12:29,063
I want you on the task force.

220
00:12:29,532 --> 00:12:31,591
I want you on the task force.

221
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:35,134
But fuck if I'm gonna go after
a favor and have you run from it.

222
00:12:35,304 --> 00:12:38,205
Now, the men who were killed
were under your brother's command.

223
00:12:38,374 --> 00:12:42,504
You could be a benefit here and show you're
worth all that early praise and promise.

224
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:45,738
Show everybody that gives a shit
that you haven't abandoned them.

225
00:12:45,915 --> 00:12:49,078
Now, Raymond, do me a favor.
Forget the past.

226
00:12:49,251 --> 00:12:51,219
Forget Mott Haven, all that shit.

227
00:12:51,387 --> 00:12:54,845
Now is now. I know it's a hell of a thing
to break back in on...

228
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:58,721
...but you worked those streets. You know
the neighborhoods up and down. Yes?

229
00:12:58,894 --> 00:13:00,623
Yeah, I worked those streets, Pop.

230
00:13:00,796 --> 00:13:02,889
Okay, so you take the task-force spot...

231
00:13:03,065 --> 00:13:05,863
...and you go at it
with all the gifts God gave you.

232
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,537
Cops died here, Raymond.

233
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,472
Four cops.

234
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:21,113
And no matter what we've forsaken
of ourselves, we can't forsake them.

235
00:13:22,618 --> 00:13:24,984
Don't sit on your hands here, kiddo.

236
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,180
Don't sit on your hands here.

237
00:13:36,332 --> 00:13:38,766
<i>I knew you couldn't stay away</i>
<i>from all this forever.</i>

238
00:13:38,934 --> 00:13:40,333
<i>Yeah, don't get used to it.</i>

239
00:13:40,503 --> 00:13:43,336
So, what do we got?
Crime Scene process these tracks?

240
00:13:43,506 --> 00:13:44,837
Yeah, it's done.

241
00:13:45,007 --> 00:13:48,773
They get anything off the canvass?
- Uh-uh. Still pending, bro.

242
00:13:48,944 --> 00:13:50,411
So they found our guy up there?

243
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,912
Yeah, Gillick.
Must've went up when it popped off.

244
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,847
Got hit halfway up,
fell back on the landing.

245
00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:00,352
Wait, they're still calling this a 911, right?
Shots-fired call?

246
00:14:00,523 --> 00:14:02,457
Yeah. Why?

247
00:14:02,892 --> 00:14:05,918
Well... I mean...

248
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,730
I don't know, man.
How you figure this went down?

249
00:14:08,898 --> 00:14:12,561
I mean, our guys go in, maybe they
take down the guy right inside the door.

250
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:16,671
Then the whole thing touches off and you
got a lot of firing, very close quarters.

251
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:20,605
So that shooter, I mean, wherever he is,
he could've split, but he didn't.

252
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,767
He dug in, shot it out.

253
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,311
I mean, maybe he
surprised them somehow.

254
00:14:25,481 --> 00:14:27,176
Maybe.

255
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,415
Somebody hit him.

256
00:14:29,585 --> 00:14:33,419
He comes out,
catches Gillick coming up the stairs.

257
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:36,285
Then he comes down,
he's dumping blood all over the place.

258
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,154
And he splits for the street.
Then he does what?

259
00:14:39,328 --> 00:14:42,092
He didn't hail a cab.
He have a car waiting?

260
00:14:42,264 --> 00:14:45,290
Go.
- Could've jacked somebody.

261
00:14:47,736 --> 00:14:50,261
Whoever he was, he was no amateur.

262
00:14:50,439 --> 00:14:53,101
No, he's just a lucky
motherfucking perp, man.

263
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,074
Maybe.

264
00:14:58,047 --> 00:14:59,912
What's up, Ray?

265
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,646
Is that you?

266
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,519
No.

267
00:15:06,689 --> 00:15:08,384
Is that yours?

268
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,186
Where is that?

269
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:15,227
I got it, I got it.
- No, no, don't touch that. Don't touch that.

270
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,237
You got a bag?

271
00:15:32,247 --> 00:15:34,647
All right. All right, listen up.
Here's what we got.

272
00:15:34,817 --> 00:15:37,479
We ran the stamp name on the smack
recovered at the scene.

273
00:15:37,653 --> 00:15:39,177
It's called WMD.

274
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:43,223
Six hits, six names.
Their sheets and mug shots are inside.

275
00:15:43,392 --> 00:15:47,123
Not a big group, so we should be able to
iso these fuckers and close them out.

276
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:49,025
So I'm gonna say it again.

277
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,393
Share your information. Anything.

278
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,997
Hints, hunches,
any scrap or shred of information.

279
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:58,503
I don't care if it goes off the back
of a matchbook, a strung-out CI.

280
00:15:58,674 --> 00:16:01,541
Put it inside the fives, get it in print
and get it to me.

281
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,007
- Where's our list?
- I got it.

282
00:16:03,178 --> 00:16:04,975
Anybody speak Spanish?

283
00:16:05,147 --> 00:16:08,378
- Yeah, I'm all right. What's up?
- I need some help with an interview.

284
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,211
Hey, vouch that and do a dump on it.

285
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,718
- See how quick they can turn it around.
- All right.

286
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,378
- What's up?
- Got a kid inside...

287
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:18,219
...who might have seen something, but
I can't understand a word they're saying.

288
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,123
And <i>papi's</i> giving me a hard time.

289
00:16:20,295 --> 00:16:23,753
- Yeah, all right. I'll give it a shot.
- All right.

290
00:16:41,984 --> 00:16:43,008
Yeah, all of it.

291
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,455
That's right. Take it easy.
You hit the calm button, all right?

292
00:16:47,623 --> 00:16:51,354
If I gotta put an arm on you, you're
gonna spend Christmas in central booking.

293
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,020
He's just a little boy.
You don't understand.

294
00:17:28,197 --> 00:17:30,062
No, I know, I know.

295
00:17:30,232 --> 00:17:33,793
I just need him to point me
in the right direction. Please.

296
00:17:34,436 --> 00:17:38,429
Come on, now. We really need
your help here. Just five minutes, okay?

297
00:17:42,177 --> 00:17:46,477
Whoa, whoa, whoa. My man, calm down.
It's the fucking holidays.

298
00:18:05,134 --> 00:18:06,692
It's Manny?

299
00:18:12,574 --> 00:18:14,838
- You speak English okay, Manny?
- Uh-huh.

300
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,570
Okay. This is gonna be easy. Okay.

301
00:18:18,113 --> 00:18:19,740
So...

302
00:18:20,649 --> 00:18:22,014
Now, you remember last night?

303
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,277
There was some loud noises
across the street.

304
00:18:24,453 --> 00:18:26,080
Guns?

305
00:18:26,255 --> 00:18:28,689
Yeah, there were guns.
You know what guns sound like?

306
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:31,621
I hear them lots of times.

307
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,123
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

308
00:18:36,732 --> 00:18:40,259
Okay, so when you heard the guns,
where were you?

309
00:18:40,435 --> 00:18:42,995
Were you over by the door
in your daddy's shop?

310
00:18:43,172 --> 00:18:44,196
Uh-huh.

311
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,638
Yeah? Could you see out onto the street?
Did you have a good view of the street?

312
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,038
Mm-hm.

313
00:18:49,244 --> 00:18:52,441
Okay. Now, when the guns
stopped shooting...

314
00:18:52,614 --> 00:18:57,916
...do you remember if a man ran out
from behind that building?

315
00:18:58,086 --> 00:18:59,485
Uh-huh.

316
00:18:59,755 --> 00:19:02,087
And did he get into a car?

317
00:19:02,257 --> 00:19:04,691
- Uh-huh.
- He did.

318
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,488
Okay, now,
I want you to think for a second.

319
00:19:07,663 --> 00:19:09,597
Did that man look like
he was hurt to you?

320
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:14,031
In the leg, he was bleeding.

321
00:19:14,203 --> 00:19:16,603
In the leg, he was bleeding.

322
00:19:17,339 --> 00:19:20,740
- In the belly, he was...
- In his belly?

323
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,035
Uh-huh.

324
00:19:22,311 --> 00:19:26,975
Okay. Manny, that's the guy
that I'm looking for. Okay?

325
00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:32,348
So I'm gonna show you some pictures.
Just a couple pictures of people.

326
00:19:32,521 --> 00:19:37,015
And if you see the guy that you saw,
the guy who got in that car, you tell me.

327
00:19:37,192 --> 00:19:38,523
Manny.

328
00:19:42,865 --> 00:19:44,457
Okay? All right.

329
00:19:45,567 --> 00:19:47,398
How about this guy?

330
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:49,835
Is that him?

331
00:19:55,477 --> 00:19:57,240
How about him?

332
00:19:58,146 --> 00:19:59,443
No?

333
00:20:02,484 --> 00:20:04,179
How about him?

334
00:20:05,754 --> 00:20:07,415
How about that one?

335
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,220
That's the man?

336
00:20:13,228 --> 00:20:15,253
That's the man that you saw?

337
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:16,954
Mm-hm.

338
00:20:17,933 --> 00:20:18,957
You sure?

339
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:23,704
Do you remember
what color that car was?

340
00:20:23,872 --> 00:20:27,535
- Um. White.
- White.

341
00:20:27,709 --> 00:20:29,870
- <i>You sound pretty sure about that.</i>
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>

342
00:20:30,712 --> 00:20:32,304
<i>It was a cab.</i>

343
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,949
<i>But not the yellow kind.</i>

344
00:20:35,117 --> 00:20:37,142
<i>Manny, you're good, man.</i>

345
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,516
<i>You don't remember if it had two doors</i>
<i>or four doors, do you?</i>

346
00:20:40,689 --> 00:20:43,249
<i>Um... Four.</i>

347
00:20:43,425 --> 00:20:45,586
<i>You have a great memory.</i>

348
00:20:45,761 --> 00:20:49,219
<i>Anything else?</i>
<i>You remember anything else?</i>

349
00:20:49,398 --> 00:20:51,389
<i>He looked scared.</i>

350
00:20:51,566 --> 00:20:54,467
<i>Who? Who looked scared?</i>

351
00:20:54,636 --> 00:20:57,901
<i>The man driving the car.</i>

352
00:20:58,874 --> 00:21:01,104
<i>He looked really scared.</i>

353
00:21:23,332 --> 00:21:25,061
What do we got?

354
00:21:26,268 --> 00:21:30,034
It's the fucking cabbie. Tezo must've
whacked him and had someone pick him up.

355
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,763
He's a fucking <i>que pasó,</i> Jimmy.

356
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:35,137
Fucking termite choking on splinters,
had a run of good fucking luck.

357
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,005
No one's that fucking lucky, Kenny.

358
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:40,842
Tezo got tipped off our boys were
coming through that door to get him.

359
00:21:41,016 --> 00:21:42,813
Christ.

360
00:21:43,151 --> 00:21:45,244
You gotta give
the little fuck credit, though.

361
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:48,981
On the fly, under pressure?
It's a fucking tight piece of work here.

362
00:21:49,157 --> 00:21:52,183
We gotta find this guy, Jimmy.
We gotta kill this prick.

363
00:21:52,361 --> 00:21:53,453
These guys were... Jesus.

364
00:21:53,628 --> 00:21:55,823
Hey, do me a big favor, all right?
All of you.

365
00:21:55,998 --> 00:21:59,229
Say nothing about this I don't already
know. It's a waste of fucking words.

366
00:22:00,602 --> 00:22:03,935
They're dead. Our money's missing. There's
only one of those things we can get back.

367
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,170
Yeah, we all loved those guys.

368
00:22:07,342 --> 00:22:10,903
It was a shitty way to punch out,
so pray they died quick and leave it alone.

369
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:13,070
First things first, we got handed up.

370
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,682
By who, we're gonna find out
real quick. Get the can.

371
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:17,751
We gotta pull the pin on this fuck now.

372
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,355
- The rat squad gets an angle on this...
- They'll blow our shit sky-high.

373
00:22:21,523 --> 00:22:22,820
What about Casado?

374
00:22:22,991 --> 00:22:26,290
What about him? Still wants Tezo
taken out. Nothing's changed.

375
00:22:26,461 --> 00:22:28,486
How do we know Tezo
didn't jet out of town?

376
00:22:28,663 --> 00:22:30,756
Because his fucking juice is here.

377
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:34,834
Goes somewhere else speaking next to no
English, he's fucking washing dishes.

378
00:22:36,304 --> 00:22:37,464
Get it good, Kenny.

379
00:22:37,639 --> 00:22:41,871
We leave nothing for them. We stay out
in front of the task force on this.

380
00:22:42,044 --> 00:22:45,104
You got a gun, you got passport
to wherever this prick's holed up.

381
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,847
Toss every block in the five boroughs
till we find this piece of shit.

382
00:23:33,128 --> 00:23:35,062
I'm sorry, Mr. Tezo.

383
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,891
I'm sorry.

384
00:23:40,035 --> 00:23:41,593
Baby.

385
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:46,871
Bring me a potato.

386
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,200
I'm sorry.

387
00:23:49,377 --> 00:23:51,208
Damn it. Fuck, I don't like that.

388
00:24:06,595 --> 00:24:11,464
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.
It hurts. I am sorry.

389
00:24:12,968 --> 00:24:13,992
Hello?

390
00:24:21,943 --> 00:24:24,434
Oh, you think?
- Shh. Shh. Shh.

391
00:24:25,113 --> 00:24:27,479
I'm gonna fucking cut you, doc.

392
00:24:28,316 --> 00:24:32,810
Okay, we are done.
That should do it for us.

393
00:24:34,289 --> 00:24:38,453
We need money for this <i>mamañé,</i>
this bullshit <i>dagabanza.</i>

394
00:24:43,431 --> 00:24:45,296
Oh, very good.

395
00:24:47,869 --> 00:24:49,029
Thank you.

396
00:24:49,204 --> 00:24:51,104
Thank you, Mr. Tezo.

397
00:24:59,714 --> 00:25:00,738
Hey, doc.

398
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,922
Hey, who's this?

399
00:25:41,089 --> 00:25:43,250
Hey, Filk, it's Ray Tierney.

400
00:25:43,425 --> 00:25:46,724
Yeah. Hey, can you
check something out for me?

401
00:25:46,995 --> 00:25:50,192
That perp who was right inside the door,
the one who had his coat on?

402
00:25:50,365 --> 00:25:53,095
Yeah, see if he got processed
that afternoon.

403
00:25:53,735 --> 00:25:55,396
Yeah.

404
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:57,531
Hang on.

405
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,576
It's Lupa. L-U-P-A. Sam...

406
00:26:02,744 --> 00:26:04,837
Son of a bitch.

407
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:09,375
I got water in my bedroom.
Don't ask.

408
00:26:09,718 --> 00:26:12,983
Sammy Lupa. Yeah.
It's not on his sheet, but look at the...

409
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:14,849
Look at those photos. He's got...

410
00:26:15,023 --> 00:26:17,651
He's got no laces in his shoes,
he's got no belt on.

411
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,226
I mean, what does that say to you?

412
00:26:20,528 --> 00:26:23,190
Well, that's why I thought so.

413
00:26:24,065 --> 00:26:25,930
All right, let me know.

414
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:29,834
Yeah. Merry Christmas. Bye.

415
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,004
Shit.

416
00:27:11,813 --> 00:27:13,007
Hey.

417
00:27:13,181 --> 00:27:15,308
You weren't gonna knock or anything?

418
00:27:16,518 --> 00:27:18,042
Yeah, I wasn't sure...

419
00:27:19,754 --> 00:27:21,984
I thought you'd be out, anyway.

420
00:27:22,157 --> 00:27:24,682
Figured you were out
doing your last-minute shopping...

421
00:27:24,859 --> 00:27:26,690
...tearing around, you know.

422
00:27:26,861 --> 00:27:30,661
I found that a while ago.
I've been meaning to give it to you.

423
00:27:32,434 --> 00:27:34,334
Thanks.

424
00:27:36,504 --> 00:27:38,028
You gonna go your mom's?

425
00:27:38,807 --> 00:27:41,469
- No, they're coming here.
- Oh.

426
00:27:41,776 --> 00:27:43,573
My sister's in town with the kids.

427
00:27:44,779 --> 00:27:46,770
Good. Good.

428
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,142
I miss them. Give them my love, okay?

429
00:27:51,886 --> 00:27:55,913
You? You going over to your parents'?

430
00:27:56,524 --> 00:27:57,991
No.

431
00:27:58,793 --> 00:28:02,957
We're gonna get everybody
over at Fran and Abby's this year.

432
00:28:03,531 --> 00:28:07,661
Just better. You know?

433
00:28:07,836 --> 00:28:09,133
How is she?

434
00:28:11,306 --> 00:28:12,830
She's the same.

435
00:28:13,007 --> 00:28:14,770
Franny, how's he holding up?

436
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,103
He's okay, I guess.

437
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,311
He doesn't talk that much about it.

438
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:24,450
But we had a bad couple days.

439
00:28:26,888 --> 00:28:28,685
You heard?

440
00:28:29,758 --> 00:28:31,749
Yeah, I heard.

441
00:28:32,927 --> 00:28:36,863
I know how close you and Lonnie were,
and I'm really sorry, Ray.

442
00:28:37,031 --> 00:28:39,295
Would it have killed you to call me?

443
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,828
- We can't keep doing this.
- Doing what?

444
00:28:45,006 --> 00:28:48,100
It's Christmas morning.
You're leaving presents on my stoop. Why?

445
00:28:48,276 --> 00:28:49,800
You're my wife for another month.

446
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:52,674
I can't leave you a Christmas present?
Are we down to that?

447
00:28:52,847 --> 00:28:55,145
We have tried and we have tried, Ray.

448
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:57,113
We went over it and we went over it...

449
00:28:57,285 --> 00:28:59,549
...and we keep coming up
against the same wall.

450
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:01,618
Come on. Come on.

451
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:05,226
No. No. That's not true.

452
00:29:06,494 --> 00:29:10,123
- Tash, if you knew how much...
- I know.

453
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,930
I feel the same way, Ray.

454
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:21,737
But I'm doing what I have to do.

455
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:25,245
This is what I need to do for me.

456
00:29:31,152 --> 00:29:32,744
Okay.

457
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:40,091
Have a merry Christmas, okay?

458
00:29:40,261 --> 00:29:42,786
Yeah, you too. You too.

459
00:29:43,465 --> 00:29:46,366
Okay. Okay, okay.

460
00:29:56,978 --> 00:29:58,775
Whole thing's fucked.

461
00:29:58,947 --> 00:30:00,244
Tezo's gone with the wind...

462
00:30:00,415 --> 00:30:04,078
...and we're out here doing this shit
on Christmas fucking morning.

463
00:30:04,252 --> 00:30:06,743
Hey, fucko, you forget
four of our guys got killed?

464
00:30:08,256 --> 00:30:11,589
Tezo was out of control. He was dishing
on the street, dealing his shit.

465
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:14,990
The cocksucker was a fucking liability.

466
00:30:15,163 --> 00:30:17,597
Lived by it, now he's
gonna fucking die by it.

467
00:30:17,765 --> 00:30:19,494
Think Casado's any better?

468
00:30:19,667 --> 00:30:21,430
Casado knows.

469
00:30:21,603 --> 00:30:24,800
Keep it inside, man,
behind closed doors.

470
00:30:24,973 --> 00:30:28,704
Out of sight, out of mind.
And the fucking envelope's on time.

471
00:30:28,977 --> 00:30:30,842
The way it was.

472
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,736
Just the way it was.

473
00:30:41,155 --> 00:30:44,147
You gotta keep your head up.
We're not paying the piper on this.

474
00:30:44,325 --> 00:30:47,317
There's no way.
We're not going to fucking jail. Okay?

475
00:30:47,495 --> 00:30:50,521
Family seeing us behind glass, fuck that.

476
00:30:51,366 --> 00:30:53,231
Fuck that.

477
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,960
Fuck it. Come on.

478
00:30:56,137 --> 00:30:58,697
Let's go pay Pepe a visit.

479
00:31:22,196 --> 00:31:24,824
Let me get a couple AA batteries, bro.

480
00:31:26,267 --> 00:31:28,201
Angel Tezo. You know him, right?

481
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:30,132
No, I don't.

482
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,234
- Angel Tezo, you know the cocksucker?
- No.

483
00:31:33,408 --> 00:31:35,933
- You don't know Angel Tezo?
- No, I don't.

484
00:31:36,444 --> 00:31:39,641
- Aah!
- Fucking liar.

485
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:42,078
Try to be a fucking gentleman.
Get on your knees.

486
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,444
Get on your fucking knees!

487
00:31:43,618 --> 00:31:45,142
- Tezo, where is he?
- I don't know.

488
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,949
You think I don't know you're running
drugs here for him, you greasy fuck?

489
00:31:49,123 --> 00:31:51,523
- Angel, you work for him? You feel that?
- Yes, I do.

490
00:31:51,693 --> 00:31:54,127
- You do. Where is he?
- I don't know. I don't know.

491
00:31:54,295 --> 00:31:58,163
You tell me where he is and you live.
- I don't know. I'm telling you, I don't know.

492
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,267
- I know you're hooked up.
- I don't know.

493
00:32:00,435 --> 00:32:01,459
Where?
- I don't know!

494
00:32:01,636 --> 00:32:05,094
I'm gonna put a bullet right in your head.
You're gonna die for that shit.

495
00:32:05,273 --> 00:32:07,673
I'm gonna count to three,
then I'm gonna shoot you.

496
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:10,208
Where the fuck is he? Where is he? One.

497
00:32:10,378 --> 00:32:12,676
I swear to God, I don't know!

498
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,508
- Where the fuck is he?
- I don't know!

499
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:15,876
One.
- Eddie!

500
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,711
- He knows where he is!
- I don't know!

501
00:32:17,885 --> 00:32:22,185
- Eddie. Eddie, he doesn't know where he is.
- He fucking knows! Back off! Two. Three!

502
00:32:23,658 --> 00:32:25,523
- Eddie, what the fuck, bro?
- Ha-ha-ha.

503
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:28,355
I'm fucking with you, man. See? See?

504
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:29,757
Get up. Get up. Get up.

505
00:32:29,931 --> 00:32:32,627
Look at your fucking nose, bro.
What the fuck?

506
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,791
Tell you what.
I'm coming back tomorrow.

507
00:32:34,969 --> 00:32:37,233
I want you to find out
where that motherfucker is.

508
00:32:37,405 --> 00:32:39,873
Hey, we're still friends, right?
We're friends, right?

509
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,065
Let's get out of here.

510
00:32:41,242 --> 00:32:44,109
Tomorrow, I'm gonna have bullets
in my gun, though. All right?

511
00:32:44,278 --> 00:32:47,111
Clean up your nose, man.
<i>Feliz Navidad,</i> brother.

512
00:32:47,281 --> 00:32:48,805
Let's go.

513
00:32:51,953 --> 00:32:53,147
I'm not playing!

514
00:32:54,689 --> 00:32:57,317
Think that's right to do that?
- Yep.

515
00:32:57,492 --> 00:33:00,984
That is not right to do that, Bailey.
I'll have you...

516
00:33:01,162 --> 00:33:04,154
- It is not right to do that.
- I could have you in cuffs.

517
00:33:04,332 --> 00:33:08,132
That's silly. I know what's gonna
happen next, you'll jump me.

518
00:33:14,876 --> 00:33:17,936
- How you doing?
- I'm good to go.

519
00:33:18,112 --> 00:33:19,773
You all right?

520
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:24,646
- Last chance to slip out the back.
- Not a chance.

521
00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:26,411
All right.

522
00:33:26,954 --> 00:33:29,218
What are you gonna do?
Yeah, that's a good...

523
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:30,914
Bailey.
- Yeah?

524
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,219
You wanna come help Mo-Mo
bake some Christmas cookies?

525
00:33:33,394 --> 00:33:34,452
Uh-huh.

526
00:33:34,629 --> 00:33:38,326
Oh, good. We got stars, we got snowmen,
we got Santa Clauses...

527
00:33:38,499 --> 00:33:42,663
- If you forfeit the game, you lose.
- I didn't forfeit the game, I won.

528
00:33:42,837 --> 00:33:47,501
And for you, mister, we got no more
of this. Come on, give me the drink.

529
00:33:47,675 --> 00:33:48,937
- No, no.
- Give me the drink.

530
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,737
- You've had enough for a while.
- No.

531
00:33:50,912 --> 00:33:52,243
- You've had enough.
- My dear.

532
00:33:52,413 --> 00:33:53,812
I know.

533
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:24,401
What have you done?

534
00:34:27,181 --> 00:34:29,342
You gotta open it up to find out.

535
00:34:58,045 --> 00:34:59,273
Is?

536
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:02,509
Gaelic.

537
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:04,708
What does it say?

538
00:35:04,886 --> 00:35:08,117
It says <i>"Mo Cion Daonnan."</i>

539
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:14,761
- What does that mean?
- It means "My love eternal."

540
00:35:52,033 --> 00:35:54,831
They can go. They can eat them.
- You got it, sweetheart?

541
00:35:57,338 --> 00:36:00,171
- Merry Christmas! Hello?
- Hey, Grandma.

542
00:36:00,808 --> 00:36:02,503
Oh, here they come, Mo-Mo.

543
00:36:02,677 --> 00:36:04,645
- Look who's here.
- Aunt Megan! Aunt Megan!

544
00:36:04,812 --> 00:36:06,780
Sorry I'm late.
Uncle Jimmy's got presents.

545
00:36:06,948 --> 00:36:08,609
There he is. There's Pop-Pop.

546
00:36:08,783 --> 00:36:11,411
Can we open presents now?
- Merry Christmas. Not yet.

547
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:12,644
Merry Christmas, chief.

548
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,583
- Hey, Ma.
- Merry Christmas.

549
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:17,280
There's my girl. How are you, buddy?

550
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:18,652
- You get good stuff?
- Yeah.

551
00:36:18,826 --> 00:36:21,192
I heard Santa Claus
comes out of the chimney.

552
00:36:21,362 --> 00:36:23,159
Whoa, it's a ball!

553
00:36:23,331 --> 00:36:24,798
- What is that?
- What about mine?

554
00:36:24,966 --> 00:36:27,799
No opening, not yet. We don't open yet.

555
00:36:27,969 --> 00:36:30,767
- Oh, look who's here.
- Ma, can we open the presents now?

556
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:33,372
Yes.
- Yeah, presents!

557
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:35,736
Okay. You can open the presents.

558
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:38,344
- Hey there.
- Merry Christmas.

559
00:36:38,512 --> 00:36:43,245
Merry Christmas. You look so beautiful.
Doesn't she look beautiful?

560
00:36:43,417 --> 00:36:45,317
All right, Christmas time. Presents.

561
00:36:45,486 --> 00:36:47,681
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.
You look beautiful.

562
00:36:47,855 --> 00:36:48,879
Thank you so much.

563
00:36:49,056 --> 00:36:51,286
Come on, Dad.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.

564
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,188
All right, kids. Gifts. Gifts, gifts.

565
00:36:53,361 --> 00:36:56,296
- Hi, handsome.
- Hey.

566
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,125
How you doing?

567
00:36:58,299 --> 00:37:02,759
- I'm okay, you know.
- Yeah? Did you see her?

568
00:37:03,037 --> 00:37:04,868
Yeah, I went by this morning.

569
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:06,666
And?

570
00:37:07,742 --> 00:37:10,233
It's the same.

571
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,837
- Holy smokes.
- One more.

572
00:37:14,015 --> 00:37:15,141
Rescue gear.

573
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:18,752
What's going on? Talk to me.
- Nothing. We ain't got shit.

574
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,251
What do you know about Tezo?

575
00:37:20,421 --> 00:37:22,753
He's a lowlife dealer.
He operates a couple blocks.

576
00:37:22,924 --> 00:37:24,858
So you're telling me we're in the clear?

577
00:37:25,026 --> 00:37:27,586
Franny, I was with Jack Gillick
last week at the range...

578
00:37:27,762 --> 00:37:29,525
- He didn't say anything?
- Not a word.

579
00:37:29,697 --> 00:37:30,857
Are you sure about that?

580
00:37:31,032 --> 00:37:33,227
My guys were doing something,
I'd know about it.

581
00:37:33,401 --> 00:37:36,097
- We gotta get this guy.
- Give me a couple days. Let me ask.

582
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:38,465
- And we'll find out. Trust me.
- All right. Yeah.

583
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:41,506
Come on, we're missing Christmas.
Come on.

584
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,406
All right, who wants ham?

585
00:37:45,046 --> 00:37:48,072
I need a knife.
- Hot stuff.

586
00:37:48,382 --> 00:37:51,317
Where's?
- Megan, this is...

587
00:37:51,485 --> 00:37:53,976
All right.
- There you are.

588
00:37:54,155 --> 00:37:55,918
Franny.

589
00:37:57,091 --> 00:37:59,559
- Last but not least.
- Oh, potatoes.

590
00:37:59,727 --> 00:38:02,423
They don't want the
Brussels sprouts. That's a little big.

591
00:38:02,596 --> 00:38:03,927
So we got sweet potatoes.

592
00:38:04,932 --> 00:38:06,923
Do these kids need any sweet potatoes?

593
00:38:07,101 --> 00:38:10,537
- Only Monday of next week.
- Monday?

594
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:14,232
Well, yeah. It wasn't just today, right?
I bring back souvenirs...

595
00:38:14,408 --> 00:38:16,501
Didn't that happen with Jimmy Jr?

596
00:38:16,677 --> 00:38:19,805
We went to the Poconos.
That was the first time we ever took a trip.

597
00:38:19,981 --> 00:38:22,211
I'd like to go on a great vacation.

598
00:38:22,917 --> 00:38:24,509
What are you talking about?

599
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:29,887
Wait three years and I'll take you
anywhere you want, sweetie pie.

600
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:39,632
So how you finding being back?

601
00:38:41,602 --> 00:38:45,663
Good. I mean, I wish it was a better
circumstance, but we've got a good team.

602
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,502
- Guys treating you all right?
- I worked with these guys.

603
00:38:48,676 --> 00:38:50,610
- You remember Chris Miller?
- Yeah, yeah.

604
00:38:50,778 --> 00:38:52,973
- I was on some cases with him.
- He's a good guy.

605
00:38:53,147 --> 00:38:55,877
Yeah.
- It's just like riding a bicycle.

606
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:58,109
You never forget to ride a bicycle.

607
00:38:58,285 --> 00:38:59,411
It's just like him.

608
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:03,455
Look how happy you made the old man.
It's the best Christmas present.

609
00:39:03,624 --> 00:39:08,391
- Caught a lucky break with that kid.
- There's nothing lucky about it.

610
00:39:08,562 --> 00:39:11,554
You have the instinct for it.
You have the talent for it.

611
00:39:11,732 --> 00:39:14,292
You can see everything
when they're kids.

612
00:39:14,468 --> 00:39:16,368
I could see him when he was a kid.
- Mm-hm.

613
00:39:17,071 --> 00:39:20,438
He was the brains. He was the thinker.

614
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:22,371
He solved problems.

615
00:39:22,543 --> 00:39:26,172
And that's what he does now as an adult,
he solves problems.

616
00:39:26,347 --> 00:39:28,372
And he was always a leader.

617
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,778
He was a leader of men,
and people listened to Franny.

618
00:39:32,353 --> 00:39:34,583
He has a personality.

619
00:39:35,189 --> 00:39:40,217
He's gonna be a full inspector
before you know it, Abby.

620
00:39:40,394 --> 00:39:44,057
And then there's my little baby girl there.

621
00:39:44,398 --> 00:39:47,731
And she was always just
the way she is right now.

622
00:39:47,902 --> 00:39:50,735
She had a heart
as big as the whole world.

623
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:53,631
As big as the whole world.

624
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:58,302
And that's why... That's what she is now.
That's why she's a nurse.

625
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,344
My kids.

626
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:06,747
That's my kids.
Most important thing in the world.

627
00:40:06,921 --> 00:40:10,379
That's a pretty high bar we set,
me and Mo-Mo, huh?

628
00:40:10,558 --> 00:40:11,991
Pretty high bar we set.

629
00:40:12,927 --> 00:40:15,020
You're okay, old man.

630
00:40:15,796 --> 00:40:17,991
You're not bad yourself.

631
00:40:35,049 --> 00:40:36,641
Shit.

632
00:40:37,952 --> 00:40:39,613
Lisette.

633
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,724
Fuck, man! I fucking...

634
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,004
10-13, 10-13...

635
00:41:13,988 --> 00:41:15,250
Okay, this is what we got.

636
00:41:15,422 --> 00:41:17,287
Number one's got a bullet in the head.

637
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:19,949
You're looking at an exit wound.
Went out the window.

638
00:41:20,127 --> 00:41:23,961
Number two put his arm up, bullet went
through the arm and into the head.

639
00:41:24,131 --> 00:41:27,498
Number three back here, he's been here
a couple days. He's a little ripe.

640
00:41:27,668 --> 00:41:29,363
Took one to the back of the head.

641
00:41:29,537 --> 00:41:33,166
And we don't really know
where the fuck he fits in just yet.

642
00:41:41,715 --> 00:41:45,742
We're thinking that's the way he took off,
through that fucking window.

643
00:41:47,321 --> 00:41:49,186
You wanna see the witness?

644
00:41:49,456 --> 00:41:50,753
- Yeah.
- Look at me.

645
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,086
She's back here.
- Hey, Lisette.

646
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,524
Now, fuck this
you-don't-understand-me bullshit.

647
00:41:55,696 --> 00:41:57,357
Steve.

648
00:41:59,066 --> 00:42:01,933
Want you to meet Ray Tierney
from the task force.

649
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:04,036
- Hey, Ray.
- Hey. Ray.

650
00:42:04,205 --> 00:42:05,934
How you doing?

651
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:08,040
So, what do you got?

652
00:42:08,209 --> 00:42:09,540
Well, she's pretty scattered.

653
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:12,577
About half a gram of coke, some hypos,
two decks of heroin...

654
00:42:12,746 --> 00:42:14,145
...you know, out of her purse.

655
00:42:14,315 --> 00:42:16,340
- Why he didn't just waste her...
- Yeah.

656
00:42:16,517 --> 00:42:17,541
What'd she say?

657
00:42:17,718 --> 00:42:20,744
Nothing I can understand.
It's all ghetto shit.

658
00:42:20,921 --> 00:42:22,388
- Can I have a few minutes?
- Yeah.

659
00:42:22,556 --> 00:42:24,524
- Get a crack at it?
- Yeah, sure.

660
00:42:33,734 --> 00:42:35,258
Lisette.

661
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:06,259
Is that your little girl?

662
00:43:08,802 --> 00:43:11,532
You're gonna lose her.
We're gonna bust you for possession.

663
00:43:11,705 --> 00:43:13,969
Child Services is gonna
take her away from you.

664
00:43:14,141 --> 00:43:17,406
Is that what you want to happen?
Is that what you want?

665
00:43:17,978 --> 00:43:19,673
Wait a minute, what is that?

666
00:43:20,147 --> 00:43:22,980
What's this? What is this?

667
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,651
What happened there?

668
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:31,180
He do that to you?
Did Tezo do that to you?

669
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:35,461
Did he, Lisette?
Did he put that gun to your head?

670
00:43:40,067 --> 00:43:41,728
What happened?

671
00:43:55,482 --> 00:43:58,747
- Has anybody looked at her?
- There's a bus on its way.

672
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:02,878
Okay. Look, I wanna help you, okay?

673
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,184
But you gotta give me something.

674
00:44:08,762 --> 00:44:11,230
I know you got something.
Give me something.

675
00:44:15,169 --> 00:44:16,568
Who?

676
00:44:17,204 --> 00:44:19,035
Sandy.

677
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:25,440
Sandy helped him escape. Who's Sandy?

678
00:44:41,362 --> 00:44:42,852
What?

679
00:44:48,569 --> 00:44:50,901
She talking about us?
- No. Shh. Shh.

680
00:44:53,374 --> 00:44:55,842
Hey, look at me. Look at me.

681
00:44:57,644 --> 00:44:58,975
Sandy's <i>policía?</i>

682
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:01,706
Tezo's friend's a cop?

683
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:10,616
If you're lying to me...

684
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:13,521
...I'm gonna take your fucking kid
away from you.

685
00:45:16,096 --> 00:45:19,122
She's bugging out.
She doesn't know what she's saying.

686
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:21,563
I tell you what, do me a favor.

687
00:45:21,735 --> 00:45:24,795
Hold on to her till she gets straight.
I'll meet you at the house.

688
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:26,496
- All right.
- Nobody talks to her.

689
00:45:26,673 --> 00:45:27,697
- All right.
- Okay?

690
00:45:27,875 --> 00:45:30,173
- I'll handle it.
- Thanks.

691
00:46:15,956 --> 00:46:19,119
Why does a man choose
to be a police officer?

692
00:46:19,293 --> 00:46:23,957
What kind of man gets up in the morning,
showers, shaves, and goes to work...

693
00:46:24,131 --> 00:46:27,897
...not knowing whether he'll be alive
at the end of the day?

694
00:46:28,602 --> 00:46:33,335
What kind of man has the courage
to stand at the door of the temple...

695
00:46:33,507 --> 00:46:38,945
...and say to those who seek to corrupt,
rob and harm our citizens:

696
00:46:39,112 --> 00:46:43,606
"Not on my watch.
You will not harm one of mine"?

697
00:46:44,451 --> 00:46:46,817
Lonnie Mercer was that kind of man.

698
00:46:47,821 --> 00:46:50,187
As we commit his body to the earth...

699
00:46:50,357 --> 00:46:53,622
...we ask God to take Lonnie's soul
into everlasting light.

700
00:46:54,962 --> 00:46:57,556
May his soul rest in peace.

701
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:59,596
Amen.

702
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:08,006
Present arms.

703
00:47:41,408 --> 00:47:42,875
Hey.

704
00:47:43,043 --> 00:47:44,635
Franny.

705
00:47:45,812 --> 00:47:47,541
Hey, Ray.
- Hey.

706
00:47:48,682 --> 00:47:51,116
- How you doing?
- I'm okay.

707
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,344
- Hey, you did good.
- You think so?

708
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,112
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

709
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,984
Yeah.

710
00:47:57,524 --> 00:47:58,821
Wanna get a cup of coffee?

711
00:47:58,992 --> 00:48:03,019
I gotta go home and see Abby and the kids.
Wanna spend the day with them, you know?

712
00:48:03,196 --> 00:48:06,359
Sure, yeah. Listen, I gotta talk to you
about some things.

713
00:48:06,533 --> 00:48:08,467
Okay. What's up?

714
00:48:09,236 --> 00:48:13,434
You and Jimmy coming up with anything
about why your guys were in that building?

715
00:48:13,907 --> 00:48:15,966
No, Ray. They were just
being cops, you know?

716
00:48:17,244 --> 00:48:20,611
Are you sure your guys didn't run
a plant-and-bust on Tezo that day?

717
00:48:21,181 --> 00:48:23,979
It feels like they popped that guy
on nickel-and-dime shit...

718
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,142
...so they could use him on a door knock.

719
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:29,922
I know these SNEU guys.
They'll go around a warrant doing that.

720
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:32,115
I need to know
if you were giving them that.

721
00:48:32,292 --> 00:48:35,159
Wait a minute. What are you saying?
Did I miss something here?

722
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:38,594
Did you already catch the scumbag
that killed four of my guys? Did you?

723
00:48:38,765 --> 00:48:39,993
Listen to me. Listen.

724
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:44,001
We found a cell phone outside
of that apartment. It was Tezo's.

725
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:47,106
We dumped it. Somebody called him
right before our guys went in.

726
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:50,609
Now, I checked it against the trace
on that 911 call.

727
00:48:50,777 --> 00:48:53,109
It's the same number, Fran.

728
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:57,446
And you know where the call came from?
It came from Coney Island.

729
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:01,483
How are shots fired in Washington Heights
heard in Brooklyn?

730
00:49:01,655 --> 00:49:03,646
- I don't know. You tell me.
- Tell me that.

731
00:49:03,824 --> 00:49:06,622
Half your guys were at that
football game, okay?

732
00:49:06,793 --> 00:49:09,489
If you were gonna pull a sting,
that would be a good time.

733
00:49:09,663 --> 00:49:12,894
Look, I'm not trying to put you on the spot.
I'm helping. I'm trying...

734
00:49:13,066 --> 00:49:15,626
Do you wanna help me?
Do you wanna fucking help me?

735
00:49:15,802 --> 00:49:18,066
You find that scumbag
that killed four of my guys.

736
00:49:18,238 --> 00:49:20,001
Yeah. Hey, hey, that's what I'm doing.

737
00:49:20,173 --> 00:49:23,768
Listen to me. Listen to me.
I talked to this broad Lisette.

738
00:49:24,077 --> 00:49:28,309
She says that a friend of his called him
and tipped him that our guys were coming.

739
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:33,319
She says it was a cop, Franny.
She said, <i>"La policía."</i>

740
00:49:33,487 --> 00:49:36,115
She said it was someone named Sandy.

741
00:49:36,289 --> 00:49:39,258
You got any cops in your precinct
named Sandy?

742
00:49:39,426 --> 00:49:40,757
No.

743
00:49:41,261 --> 00:49:42,285
No nicknames, nothing?

744
00:49:42,462 --> 00:49:45,727
- I said I don't know anyone named Sandy.
- Okay, okay, listen.

745
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:48,197
I have not shared this around, Franny.

746
00:49:48,368 --> 00:49:52,361
It is not gonna take peerless detective work
for someone else to connect these dots.

747
00:49:52,539 --> 00:49:54,598
I know you're trying to protect your guys...

748
00:49:54,775 --> 00:49:58,973
...but you gotta get...
- Protect? Protect? They're gone, Raymond.

749
00:49:59,312 --> 00:50:03,112
Freddie, Jack, Billy, Lonnie.
They're all dead.

750
00:50:03,283 --> 00:50:05,683
What the fuck do I gotta
protect them from now, huh?

751
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:10,188
Fran. I'm trying to protect you.

752
00:50:11,158 --> 00:50:14,924
You know, these questions are gonna come,
Fran. We gotta start dealing with it.

753
00:50:17,798 --> 00:50:20,824
Find fucking Tezo, Ray,
all right? Do me a favor.

754
00:50:31,645 --> 00:50:33,579
Anybody in?

755
00:50:33,747 --> 00:50:35,214
Yeah.

756
00:50:39,486 --> 00:50:41,852
- Hey.
- Hey.

757
00:50:42,022 --> 00:50:43,580
Come on in.

758
00:50:46,059 --> 00:50:47,686
What happened?

759
00:50:49,196 --> 00:50:52,893
My carpet. What happened to the carpet?

760
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:57,230
You're supposed to fix the leaks before you
put the carpet down, Pop. You know that?

761
00:50:57,404 --> 00:50:58,666
Oh...

762
00:50:59,172 --> 00:51:02,835
Boats leak, Raymond.
It's the nature of things.

763
00:51:05,212 --> 00:51:06,543
Close the door, will you?

764
00:51:12,686 --> 00:51:14,176
There you go.

765
00:51:14,788 --> 00:51:18,747
- Have a few nips this evening, Pop?
- Had a glass of Scotch, officer.

766
00:51:18,925 --> 00:51:20,017
Just one, huh?

767
00:51:20,761 --> 00:51:22,388
I used the same glass, yeah.

768
00:51:24,064 --> 00:51:26,225
Let me put on a pot of coffee.

769
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:31,296
Oh, boy.

770
00:51:32,606 --> 00:51:35,040
Got some memories in this tub.

771
00:51:35,208 --> 00:51:37,108
Here. Drink that.

772
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:41,013
It's nice and warm.

773
00:51:43,817 --> 00:51:45,910
Your brother called me.

774
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,715
Oh, yeah? Did he get something?

775
00:51:48,889 --> 00:51:51,414
Ears to the ground,
but they're getting blanked.

776
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,189
He said you came at him a little bit.

777
00:51:57,330 --> 00:51:59,890
Asking about his boys,
how they were operating.

778
00:52:00,066 --> 00:52:02,899
I ran up against some shit
didn't feel right.

779
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:06,466
I went to see if Franny and Jimmy
could clear it up for me.

780
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:09,939
But it didn't file?
You didn't put it down in the fives?

781
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:12,578
No, I didn't put it in the fives yet.

782
00:52:12,746 --> 00:52:14,213
But some of it, Pop, I gotta.

783
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:17,214
Raymond, you got
something case-pertinent...

784
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:20,979
...help us catch this cocksucker,
by all means, share.

785
00:52:21,154 --> 00:52:22,985
But you start looking for loose ends...

786
00:52:23,156 --> 00:52:26,557
...where your brother's boys
are concerned, where's that gonna fall?

787
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:29,854
You think I'm not thinking about that?
This isn't loose ends.

788
00:52:31,097 --> 00:52:33,895
Pop, I got the shooter's girl saying...

789
00:52:34,701 --> 00:52:37,192
Saying that he got tipped off.

790
00:52:37,370 --> 00:52:39,634
And she says it was a cop
that made the call.

791
00:52:44,544 --> 00:52:46,876
Are you telling me
we're gonna suppress that?

792
00:52:47,147 --> 00:52:48,944
Not suppress, Raymond.

793
00:52:49,115 --> 00:52:52,346
Sit on, for the moment,
anything that might go sideways on us.

794
00:52:52,519 --> 00:52:54,043
Oh, come on. It's the same thing.

795
00:52:54,221 --> 00:52:56,587
You know what position
that's gonna put me in?

796
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:59,020
Raymond, eight years
as a Major Case narc...

797
00:52:59,192 --> 00:53:02,650
...and you never let something settle
before you put it in print?

798
00:53:02,829 --> 00:53:05,798
Made sure it wasn't gonna come back,
bite you, jam you up?

799
00:53:05,966 --> 00:53:08,491
I'm not looking to jam anybody up,
not intentionally.

800
00:53:08,668 --> 00:53:10,795
Intentionally, unintentionally.
Doesn't matter.

801
00:53:10,971 --> 00:53:13,963
Anything that makes cops look culpable
is no good, Raymond.

802
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:18,302
What do you want me to do with it?

803
00:53:19,012 --> 00:53:21,344
- You want me to spell it out for you?
- Yeah.

804
00:53:21,514 --> 00:53:25,644
Stay on point. Keep your focus
on finding the fuck who killed our guys.

805
00:53:25,819 --> 00:53:28,151
And if you find anything else
that seems off...

806
00:53:28,321 --> 00:53:32,348
...you come to me
and we deal with it. Okay?

807
00:53:32,525 --> 00:53:34,493
If you say so.

808
00:53:37,397 --> 00:53:39,331
I say so.

809
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,495
Okay.

810
00:53:50,343 --> 00:53:52,243
- Hey, Lou, you still here?
- Yes, boss.

811
00:53:52,412 --> 00:53:55,381
No one goes downstairs.
- You got it, boss.

812
00:54:05,292 --> 00:54:07,089
Hey, Sandy.

813
00:54:09,296 --> 00:54:12,993
Hey, boss.
What are you doing here this late?

814
00:54:14,935 --> 00:54:16,596
Come here.

815
00:54:22,375 --> 00:54:25,037
Hey, guys. Clear it out.

816
00:54:25,478 --> 00:54:28,641
Zach, take it upstairs.

817
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:37,322
What's up?

818
00:54:38,992 --> 00:54:41,017
I'm gonna ask you this one time, Sandy.

819
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:42,786
Okay.

820
00:54:43,229 --> 00:54:46,665
And if your first impulse is to lie,
you better fucking resist like hell.

821
00:54:46,833 --> 00:54:48,858
Boss, what are you talking about?

822
00:54:50,503 --> 00:54:52,061
Angel Tezo.

823
00:54:53,807 --> 00:54:55,297
Yeah?

824
00:54:56,409 --> 00:54:59,276
This girl they hauled in
up in the Bronx, Lisette Rivera...

825
00:55:00,814 --> 00:55:02,873
...she was the last one with him.

826
00:55:03,249 --> 00:55:06,980
She said a cop tipped Tezo off
to the Washington Heights raid.

827
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:10,316
She said this cop
went by the name Sandy.

828
00:55:11,091 --> 00:55:13,753
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

829
00:55:14,627 --> 00:55:16,390
Well, shit, I don't know no...

830
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:17,723
You set them up to die?

831
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:19,296
- Your own men!
- I didn't know.

832
00:55:19,466 --> 00:55:23,334
- You let them walk into that?
- I didn't know! Jesus Christ, cap, please.

833
00:55:23,503 --> 00:55:27,132
He was... I've known him since we
were kids. He was my ex-wife's cousin.

834
00:55:27,307 --> 00:55:29,036
You fucking piece of shit!

835
00:55:29,209 --> 00:55:32,667
I told him to get out, they were coming.
I didn't know he'd stay.

836
00:55:32,846 --> 00:55:34,040
You didn't know he'd stay?

837
00:55:34,214 --> 00:55:36,444
I swear, I didn't know
it would end up like that!

838
00:55:36,616 --> 00:55:38,447
What did you think would happen, Sandy?

839
00:55:38,618 --> 00:55:41,849
They were going in there to kill him.
Egan said for them to kill him.

840
00:55:42,022 --> 00:55:43,580
What...? What?

841
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:45,622
Jimmy? Jimmy Egan said what?

842
00:55:45,792 --> 00:55:48,317
He wanted Tezo dead.
He sent them in there to do him...

843
00:55:48,495 --> 00:55:49,553
...take his money.

844
00:55:49,729 --> 00:55:52,755
Are you fucking telling me Jimmy Egan
was going after drug money?

845
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:57,096
Kill Tezo, steal his shit,
get into business with Casado.

846
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:59,329
That was the deal.

847
00:56:06,413 --> 00:56:09,610
You're telling me the fucking SNEU team
was going after drug dealers?

848
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:13,549
That Jimmy Egan was fucking putting hits
out on people for fucking money?

849
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:16,018
- That's what you were doing on the street?
- Yeah.

850
00:56:16,189 --> 00:56:18,783
And you dealt with that
by setting up your own crew?

851
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:20,755
By sending them into a fucking ambush?

852
00:56:20,927 --> 00:56:23,828
You don't call me?
You don't fucking come to me, Sandy?

853
00:56:23,997 --> 00:56:27,023
- I'm your fucking CO!
- I didn't know they'd die.

854
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:30,931
And I thought you knew.
Everybody knew.

855
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:41,113
Hey, get out of here.

856
00:56:41,281 --> 00:56:43,044
Get the fuck out of here!

857
00:56:54,227 --> 00:56:56,525
You're done. Tonight.

858
00:56:57,263 --> 00:56:59,493
Turn in your gun, shield, ID card.

859
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:03,693
And if I see you around here, Sandy,
I will shit-can your pension for good.

860
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:06,032
This is all I got.

861
00:57:08,108 --> 00:57:10,372
Well, you don't got this anymore.

862
00:59:00,053 --> 00:59:01,680
Fuck!

863
00:59:01,854 --> 00:59:04,823
Aah! Whoo!

864
00:59:07,227 --> 00:59:08,421
Ready?
- Yeah.

865
00:59:08,595 --> 00:59:09,619
Four.
- Hut-hut.

866
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:10,956
Hike.

867
00:59:14,334 --> 00:59:15,733
There's nothing wrong with...

868
00:59:15,902 --> 00:59:17,961
That means we're gonna have,
what, four kids?

869
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:21,038
Four kids? I can't afford that shit.
Four kids?

870
00:59:21,207 --> 00:59:22,799
This one.

871
00:59:23,343 --> 00:59:24,401
You think that's fun?

872
00:59:24,577 --> 00:59:27,307
It's definitely time for hot chocolate
and marshmallows.

873
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:28,811
Do you have ice in your boot?

874
00:59:31,384 --> 00:59:34,376
Okay. There we go, baby. Whoo!

875
00:59:35,255 --> 00:59:37,815
- All right, honey, boots.
- Okay.

876
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:39,920
- Ow, ow, ow.
- Oh, I'm sorry, pumpkin.

877
00:59:40,093 --> 00:59:41,424
- I'm okay.
Okay.

878
00:59:42,762 --> 00:59:46,528
Oh, who's that?
Who is that? Let's go get the door.

879
00:59:50,036 --> 00:59:51,833
What's up, guy?

880
00:59:52,472 --> 00:59:54,531
Hi there.
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Egan.

881
00:59:54,707 --> 00:59:56,334
Is Jimmy home?

882
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:57,874
Yeah. I'm sorry, who are you?

883
00:59:58,044 --> 01:00:00,569
- I'm a old friend of his.
- You're an old friend of his?

884
01:00:00,747 --> 01:00:03,716
Baby, I got it. Jimmy, come here.
Come here. Get inside.

885
01:00:03,883 --> 01:00:07,319
- Get some hot chocolate. I got it.
- He's an old friend.

886
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:11,548
What the fuck you doing here,
Casado? Get around back. Now.

887
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:15,088
Who's that, baby?

888
01:00:15,261 --> 01:00:17,229
Nobody. He's out of here in five minutes.

889
01:00:17,397 --> 01:00:20,560
- Where do you know him from?
- From work. He shouldn't be here.

890
01:00:20,733 --> 01:00:22,462
So why is he here?

891
01:00:22,902 --> 01:00:24,096
I'm gonna get rid of him.

892
01:00:24,270 --> 01:00:26,500
Kiss for me? Rah!

893
01:00:27,006 --> 01:00:29,338
- I love you, Daddy.
- I love you too.

894
01:00:29,609 --> 01:00:31,201
You too, Mommy.

895
01:00:31,678 --> 01:00:33,543
Do you have any juice?

896
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:36,238
Jimmy, Franny's called you
like a thousand times today.

897
01:00:36,416 --> 01:00:39,817
- You gonna call him back or what?
- Yeah, Bobby's going on vacation.

898
01:00:40,987 --> 01:00:44,184
Probably wants me to cover.
I'll talk to him tonight.

899
01:00:52,165 --> 01:00:54,429
You know how many cops
I got as neighbors, moron?

900
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:55,760
I figured that.

901
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:57,994
What got into your head,
you come to my home?

902
01:00:58,171 --> 01:01:02,267
Well, I call you on your jack
and it's disconnected.

903
01:01:02,442 --> 01:01:05,969
You could have caught a tail. They could
have eyes and ears on us right now.

904
01:01:06,145 --> 01:01:09,205
Better slow down how you talking to me.
I'll smack fire out you.

905
01:01:09,382 --> 01:01:11,509
And I don't give a fuck
if you a cop or no cop.

906
01:01:11,684 --> 01:01:13,879
- Understand me?
- Listen, you fucking cocksucker.

907
01:01:14,053 --> 01:01:17,511
I don't care how much jack you think
you got, who's backing your play.

908
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:21,285
You come to my house, you try to
press me in front of my kids, my wife...

909
01:01:21,461 --> 01:01:23,429
...it's a fucking mistake.

910
01:01:23,596 --> 01:01:27,464
- Yeah, laugh, you fucking scumbag.
- You hard as fuck, Jimmy, wow.

911
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:31,258
But you slipping, J. You slipping.

912
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:34,895
- Why is this motherfucker still breathing?
- We on a buzzer beater with you?

913
01:01:35,074 --> 01:01:37,065
- Is this a clock?
- Might as well be.

914
01:01:37,243 --> 01:01:41,043
I give you money,
and this shit ain't handled?

915
01:01:41,214 --> 01:01:44,115
You fucking with old boy,
you should be fucking with me, Jimmy.

916
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:47,514
- What's the problem? What's the problem?
- You glance at a TV lately?

917
01:01:47,687 --> 01:01:48,813
- Yeah.
- What'd you see?

918
01:01:48,988 --> 01:01:52,890
Your boys been getting blasted lately,
but I don't give a shit about that.

919
01:01:53,059 --> 01:01:56,620
I just wanna know, are we straight?
Are we straight, Jimmy?

920
01:01:56,796 --> 01:01:58,161
Did I make the arrangement?

921
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:00,933
- Did I take the money?
- You took the money.

922
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:03,068
- What does that say?
- That don't say shit...

923
01:02:03,236 --> 01:02:05,932
Listen to me. Listen.
Do not fucking shout in my doghouse.

924
01:02:06,105 --> 01:02:08,266
- You need to slow the fuck down.
- Listen.

925
01:02:08,441 --> 01:02:11,376
- Listen to me, you motherfucker. Listen up.
- What you gonna say?

926
01:02:11,544 --> 01:02:13,671
When he's dead, it's done.

927
01:02:14,113 --> 01:02:15,876
If I see you come around here again...

928
01:02:16,048 --> 01:02:19,176
...anywhere near my house,
anywhere near my fucking family...

929
01:02:19,352 --> 01:02:24,016
...if you even mention a word about my
kids and my wife again, I will kill you.

930
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:27,918
Stop. Give me that.

931
01:02:33,433 --> 01:02:39,201
- Get the fuck out of my house.
- You fucked up, Jimmy. You fucked up.

932
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:45,366
Get that fucking dirty-ass fucking
monkey language out of my fucking yard.

933
01:02:45,545 --> 01:02:48,605
Get that fucking monkey language out of
my fucking yard.

934
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,249
Don't. Give me it.

935
01:02:56,422 --> 01:02:58,856
Say goodbye to the family for me, okay?

936
01:03:39,732 --> 01:03:41,529
Kenny.

937
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:44,028
I'm in here, baby.

938
01:03:45,004 --> 01:03:48,064
Yeah, okay. Hold on.

939
01:03:52,311 --> 01:03:54,279
Okay. I'll be right there.

940
01:03:54,447 --> 01:03:56,881
- Hey, Jimmy, what's up?
<i>Where the fuck is everybody?</i>

941
01:03:57,049 --> 01:03:59,540
<i>Calling Eddie, Sandy.</i>
<i>No one's picking up.</i>

942
01:03:59,719 --> 01:04:02,483
Eddie's sleeping off Christmas.
I don't know where Sandy is.

943
01:04:02,655 --> 01:04:07,115
<i>I got some intel from a guy in Heida.</i>
<i>You remember Coco Dominguez?</i>

944
01:04:07,293 --> 01:04:11,821
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Tezo's lieutenant.
- <i>Yeah, Tezo's lieutenant. He fucked up.</i>

945
01:04:11,998 --> 01:04:15,525
<i>Back in town from the D.R.</i>
<i>He came in to see his kids for the holidays.</i>

946
01:04:15,701 --> 01:04:17,931
<i>He's not gonna give him up.</i>

947
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:19,696
<i>No way Coco's gonna talk, Jimmy.</i>

948
01:04:23,042 --> 01:04:24,771
Hey, Coco.

949
01:04:28,481 --> 01:04:30,210
- Where is he?
- Get down. Get the kids down.

950
01:04:30,383 --> 01:04:32,783
- He gone, you motherfucker. Gone.
- Gone where, Coco?

951
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:36,547
Gone, nigga. Now, do your fucking job
and find him, motherfucker.

952
01:04:45,197 --> 01:04:48,633
If you let me get out of this shit,
I'm gonna come back and stab you... Aah!

953
01:04:49,235 --> 01:04:52,671
- Deranged motherfucker.
- You're gonna tell me where he is.

954
01:04:52,838 --> 01:04:55,306
- You're gonna tell me.
- I'll tell you where he is.

955
01:04:55,474 --> 01:04:57,965
I'll tell you.
He's up your mama's ass, bitch!

956
01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:00,203
Please.
- Angelique, put the boy back!

957
01:05:00,379 --> 01:05:03,246
Angelique, put the boy back in!
Push that nigga back!

958
01:05:03,416 --> 01:05:07,079
Angelique, get the boy back in the room
now! Push that nigga back, Angelique!

959
01:05:07,253 --> 01:05:09,847
Angelique, get the boy back in!
Put the baby back in!

960
01:05:10,022 --> 01:05:12,115
- Put the baby back in the room!
- Ugh!

961
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:17,991
Shut up. Do you understand me?
You speak English?

962
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:22,225
Shut up! Shut your fucking...
Shut your mouth. Shut it.

963
01:05:25,371 --> 01:05:28,033
Still up my mother's ass? Huh?

964
01:05:29,442 --> 01:05:31,103
Talk to me.

965
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:35,943
Kenny, put in a call to ACS.

966
01:05:36,716 --> 01:05:40,379
Tell them they gotta take an infant.
First-degree burns over most of its body.

967
01:05:40,553 --> 01:05:44,182
- Tell them the baby's face is disfigured.
- Sure thing, Jimmy.

968
01:05:45,257 --> 01:05:47,316
Use your phone, <i>muchacho?</i> Hm?

969
01:05:57,169 --> 01:05:58,261
Angel Tezo.

970
01:05:59,672 --> 01:06:02,869
Fuck you, Jimmy. Kiss my fucking ass.

971
01:06:06,912 --> 01:06:09,813
Wait, wait! He's up in Morrisania
in the Bronx at the bitch's place.

972
01:06:09,982 --> 01:06:12,746
- Where? Where? You talk to him?
- At his bitch's place.

973
01:06:12,918 --> 01:06:14,215
- Who? Who?
- Esther, Esther!

974
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:18,824
Esther fucking what?
You better fucking tell me! Esther what?

975
01:06:18,991 --> 01:06:20,151
You tell him where he is!

976
01:06:20,326 --> 01:06:22,556
- Esther fucking what?
- Kane. Kane, nigga! Kane!

977
01:06:22,728 --> 01:06:27,222
Esther-motherfucking-Kane, nigga!
Now, put the baby down, nigga!

978
01:06:31,537 --> 01:06:33,198
Please.
- Come here. You're okay.

979
01:06:33,372 --> 01:06:35,966
Oh, no! Please, please, officer.

980
01:06:42,581 --> 01:06:44,173
- Oh, God.
- He's beautiful.

981
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:57,252
You breathe a word of this,
and I come back here.

982
01:06:58,698 --> 01:07:02,532
I'll slit your throat, fuck your wife
and kill your kid.

983
01:07:02,768 --> 01:07:04,326
Look at me.

984
01:07:04,503 --> 01:07:07,597
You tip Angel off,
I'll make it even worse.

985
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:12,570
I'll send an ambulance over.

986
01:07:45,578 --> 01:07:47,409
Oh, shit.

987
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:49,741
Go, go, go!

988
01:07:57,389 --> 01:07:58,754
Hey, Took.

989
01:07:58,924 --> 01:08:01,688
- Oh, no, no, no.
- No, come on. Leave me alone, bro!

990
01:08:01,861 --> 01:08:04,329
- Come on, Took.
- I didn't do nothing.

991
01:08:05,297 --> 01:08:07,595
- Where you going?
- Leave me alone, yo!

992
01:08:07,767 --> 01:08:09,826
Come here, dipshit. Come here.
- Come on.

993
01:08:10,002 --> 01:08:12,766
You run on me? You running
from me? Get up against the wall.

994
01:08:12,938 --> 01:08:14,200
- All right!
- Shut up.

995
01:08:14,373 --> 01:08:16,000
- All right.
- You got a demo in here?

996
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:18,939
- If I cut my hand, I'm gonna get...
- In my pocket. My pocket.

997
01:08:19,111 --> 01:08:22,308
- What pocket?
- The other pocket, bro. The other one.

998
01:08:22,481 --> 01:08:25,973
You been smoking too much of this
devil's shit. It's messing with your mind.

999
01:08:26,152 --> 01:08:28,416
Your friend come to check up on you,
you bug out?

1000
01:08:28,587 --> 01:08:30,919
I haven't seen you in a long time.
What you expect?

1001
01:08:31,090 --> 01:08:33,957
I just came to talk.
We're gonna have a little talk, okay?

1002
01:08:34,126 --> 01:08:36,526
- You chill? You gonna chill out?
- I'm chill, B.

1003
01:08:36,695 --> 01:08:39,425
- Okay, you don't look chill.
- I'm chill, yo. I'm chill.

1004
01:08:39,598 --> 01:08:41,293
What you expect, bro?
You scared me, man.

1005
01:08:41,467 --> 01:08:44,493
Whoa! What is this, the fucking airport?
Give it over. Give it.

1006
01:08:44,670 --> 01:08:46,934
What do you want from me?
- You know how it works.

1007
01:08:47,106 --> 01:08:49,540
Come on. We help each other out,
just like old times.

1008
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:50,732
- Okay?
- Why?

1009
01:08:50,910 --> 01:08:53,310
Give me some good skank,
I'll give you your cook-up.

1010
01:08:53,479 --> 01:08:55,208
- What?
- Okay? I want Angel Tezo.

1011
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:58,043
You and every other cop in the city's
asking that shit, B.

1012
01:08:58,217 --> 01:09:01,277
- I don't know shit, B.
- Oh, yeah? You weren't steering for him?

1013
01:09:01,453 --> 01:09:03,921
Getting cracked out with his cousin?
Don't shine me.

1014
01:09:04,089 --> 01:09:07,889
I swear on everything I love, yo.
He'll smoke me if I talk to you, yo. Chill.

1015
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:11,188
If I pop you for this, you're dodging
dicks in Rikers before Friday.

1016
01:09:11,363 --> 01:09:12,523
- Come on.
- Take your pick.

1017
01:09:12,698 --> 01:09:14,222
- Give me my shit.
- Want your shit?

1018
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,527
- I pick my shit. Come on.
- Want your shit?

1019
01:09:16,702 --> 01:09:18,169
No, stop.
- There's your shit.

1020
01:09:18,337 --> 01:09:20,965
Stop playing, Tierney! Man!
Tierney, come on, yo.

1021
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:23,233
- What is this, a charity I'm running?
- No, no.

1022
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:25,741
We're here to trade.
You gotta sell me something.

1023
01:09:25,911 --> 01:09:28,436
- Nothing?
- No, no, no!

1024
01:09:28,614 --> 01:09:30,377
- No!
- Too bad. Last one.

1025
01:09:30,549 --> 01:09:32,608
- Stop playing. Chill. No.
- A little bit.

1026
01:09:32,785 --> 01:09:34,446
- Come on, please.
- What do you think?

1027
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:36,713
- What do you think? Got something?
- All right.

1028
01:09:36,889 --> 01:09:38,720
Where's he at? Who's helping him?

1029
01:09:38,891 --> 01:09:41,655
No, Ray, no, no, last one. All right.
All right. All right.

1030
01:09:47,399 --> 01:09:50,994
Miller, I got a line on Tezo.
I got a line on Tezo. Send backup.

1031
01:09:51,170 --> 01:09:55,266
I'm on my way there right now.
433 Central Avenue, Morrisania.

1032
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:58,740
Yeah, no, I know. I know,
but we missed it. We missed it, okay?

1033
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:02,369
Just... I'll see you there.
I'll explain it there.

1034
01:10:10,389 --> 01:10:12,084
Come on.

1035
01:11:35,207 --> 01:11:37,732
Audubon 6 to Central,
I got shots fired. Shots fired.

1036
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:41,175
433 Central Avenue in the Bronx.
I need backup.

1037
01:11:48,087 --> 01:11:51,056
I'm going in. I need backup forthwith.

1038
01:12:19,184 --> 01:12:20,913
Shit.

1039
01:12:38,103 --> 01:12:39,866
Go away.

1040
01:12:46,111 --> 01:12:47,840
Get him up, man!

1041
01:12:48,013 --> 01:12:50,641
Pig! Get the fuck off me!

1042
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:53,880
Fuck you!

1043
01:13:02,094 --> 01:13:04,085
Open his fucking mouth.

1044
01:13:12,404 --> 01:13:14,269
Give me something.

1045
01:13:15,674 --> 01:13:16,698
Give me something.

1046
01:13:16,875 --> 01:13:17,933
Fucking answer.

1047
01:13:20,712 --> 01:13:23,010
I want a fucking name.

1048
01:13:27,352 --> 01:13:28,910
Sandy.

1049
01:13:29,088 --> 01:13:30,851
Finish him.

1050
01:13:32,291 --> 01:13:33,417
Jimmy.

1051
01:13:34,259 --> 01:13:35,624
Hey, no, no! It's Ray!

1052
01:13:35,794 --> 01:13:38,922
- Ray? Ray, we got him.
- Jimmy, what the fuck is going on here?

1053
01:13:39,098 --> 01:13:40,122
- We got him.
- What?

1054
01:13:40,299 --> 01:13:42,699
- We got him.
- What are you guys even doing here?

1055
01:13:42,868 --> 01:13:44,392
- What is he...?
- It's handled, Ray.

1056
01:13:44,570 --> 01:13:47,130
What do you mean, it's handled?
What are you...? Come on!

1057
01:13:47,306 --> 01:13:49,035
Hey. Enough. Enough.

1058
01:13:49,208 --> 01:13:50,732
- Oh, my God.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1059
01:13:50,909 --> 01:13:52,672
- Don't fucking take it out!
- Hey, hey.

1060
01:13:52,845 --> 01:13:54,369
- Motherfucker.
- Don't take it out.

1061
01:13:54,546 --> 01:13:56,946
- Take your hands off of me.
- Ray, put the gun away.

1062
01:13:57,116 --> 01:13:59,016
Put your hand on me again, asshole.

1063
01:14:04,256 --> 01:14:05,985
Oh, my God.

1064
01:14:06,158 --> 01:14:09,753
- Fuck him, he's done.
- He's not done. He's alive.

1065
01:14:12,631 --> 01:14:14,360
Jesus.

1066
01:14:15,334 --> 01:14:17,165
Jesus.

1067
01:14:21,740 --> 01:14:23,230
He's dead.

1068
01:14:24,409 --> 01:14:25,433
Jimmy.

1069
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:29,772
Good work, Ray.

1070
01:14:30,249 --> 01:14:31,944
Good work.

1071
01:14:38,790 --> 01:14:42,351
You motherfucker! You motherfucker!
What the fuck are you thinking?

1072
01:14:42,528 --> 01:14:44,257
- Get back.
- Have you lost your mind?

1073
01:14:44,429 --> 01:14:45,896
Ray.

1074
01:14:48,433 --> 01:14:52,699
I fucking love you, Ray.
You know I do. You're family.

1075
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:55,806
Your backup's coming.

1076
01:14:56,108 --> 01:14:57,803
So here's what happened.

1077
01:14:57,976 --> 01:15:00,843
Now, you got here first. He resisted.

1078
01:15:01,613 --> 01:15:03,740
You had to put three in him.

1079
01:15:04,716 --> 01:15:05,978
It was a clean shoot.

1080
01:15:07,219 --> 01:15:10,780
- You have lost your fucking mind.
- You're a cop, Ray.

1081
01:15:11,056 --> 01:15:12,387
Just like us.

1082
01:15:12,858 --> 01:15:14,951
You're a fucking cop.

1083
01:15:17,029 --> 01:15:21,090
- Get your fucking hands off me. Get off me.
- Let him go. Let him go. Let him go.

1084
01:15:21,333 --> 01:15:23,631
He knows what he's
gotta do here, right, Jimmy?

1085
01:15:24,503 --> 01:15:26,403
Yeah. It's gonna be all right.

1086
01:15:42,554 --> 01:15:44,852
You talk to him?
- No. Look, Ray...

1087
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:48,857
- What are you doing here? Talk to him.
- Calm down. We're gonna figure this out.

1088
01:15:49,027 --> 01:15:52,292
Was there static on the line?
Did you hear what I fucking said?

1089
01:15:52,464 --> 01:15:57,094
Jimmy executed him. He took my fucking
gun off me, Francis, and shot him.

1090
01:15:57,269 --> 01:15:59,965
What the fuck is going on here?
Did you send him in there?

1091
01:16:00,138 --> 01:16:03,301
- What did you know? Were you in on this?
- No, I didn't know, Ray.

1092
01:16:03,475 --> 01:16:04,635
You didn't know like
you didn't know about Sandy?

1093
01:16:06,699 --> 01:16:10,726
I come to you and I asked you if you had
a cop in your precinct named Sandy.

1094
01:16:10,904 --> 01:16:13,395
A nickname, I said.
Tell me you weren't lying to me.

1095
01:16:13,573 --> 01:16:16,440
I needed to find out for myself.
You've been gone a long time.

1096
01:16:16,609 --> 01:16:19,544
Come on.
I came to you to try to help you.

1097
01:16:19,712 --> 01:16:23,671
Do you have any idea what Jimmy's been
doing under your roof? Do you even care?

1098
01:16:23,850 --> 01:16:25,181
I'm doing my best. All right?

1099
01:16:25,351 --> 01:16:29,048
I'm in the hospital all day with my wife,
who's fucking dying.

1100
01:16:31,624 --> 01:16:35,116
Look, I know Jimmy's out of control.
Believe me, I'm gonna take care of him.

1101
01:16:35,295 --> 01:16:38,423
But you and I, we gotta keep
our heads up here, Ray.

1102
01:16:38,598 --> 01:16:41,294
We gotta handle this so no one else
gets hurt. You hear me?

1103
01:16:41,468 --> 01:16:42,765
We're not gonna handle this.

1104
01:16:42,936 --> 01:16:46,372
What do you think? You think we're
gonna go with Pop and smooth this over?

1105
01:16:46,539 --> 01:16:50,031
That is not gonna happen. This isn't
Mott Haven. I won't stand up for that.

1106
01:16:50,210 --> 01:16:53,145
You know, it's not Mott Haven.
This is not about the department.

1107
01:16:53,313 --> 01:16:57,773
This is about me. My command.
All this shit falls on me, Ray.

1108
01:16:57,951 --> 01:17:01,409
So, what do you wanna do? You wanna
cut me off at the fucking knees?

1109
01:17:01,588 --> 01:17:03,488
You wanna watch me go down in flames?

1110
01:17:03,656 --> 01:17:06,489
Is that gonna satisfy your sense
of right and wrong?

1111
01:17:07,293 --> 01:17:09,557
We got an out here, Ray.

1112
01:17:12,665 --> 01:17:14,997
Jesus, Francis.

1113
01:17:19,472 --> 01:17:21,633
I know this is fucked up, okay?

1114
01:17:21,808 --> 01:17:23,776
But I need you.

1115
01:17:26,079 --> 01:17:28,673
This is fucking you and me.

1116
01:17:30,550 --> 01:17:33,610
When we were kids,
all we ever talked about was being cops.

1117
01:17:34,487 --> 01:17:38,287
How the fuck did we end up at this?

1118
01:17:45,565 --> 01:17:47,590
What are you gonna do, Ray?

1119
01:17:49,602 --> 01:17:51,160
I don't know.

1120
01:17:52,138 --> 01:17:55,039
I don't know.
I'm gonna get this fucking blood off me.

1121
01:17:56,342 --> 01:17:57,866
Ray.

1122
01:18:14,394 --> 01:18:17,795
<i>You were gone a long time.</i>
<i>Where were you?</i>

1123
01:18:17,964 --> 01:18:19,431
Uh...

1124
01:18:20,266 --> 01:18:21,824
I just...

1125
01:18:22,702 --> 01:18:25,432
I just had to talk to Ray
about something.

1126
01:18:25,939 --> 01:18:27,930
What is it, Francis?

1127
01:18:28,107 --> 01:18:30,268
Is everything okay?

1128
01:18:34,714 --> 01:18:36,944
You know, Ab, it's not.

1129
01:18:38,451 --> 01:18:39,645
What's going on?

1130
01:18:42,488 --> 01:18:44,479
Oh, fuck, Abby.

1131
01:18:44,657 --> 01:18:48,058
Oh, Francis, talk to me.

1132
01:18:48,227 --> 01:18:51,788
I mean, don't not tell me
something which is...

1133
01:18:55,168 --> 01:18:57,102
Because...

1134
01:19:01,874 --> 01:19:04,104
Those men, Abby.

1135
01:19:06,546 --> 01:19:08,741
Those four cops.

1136
01:19:11,351 --> 01:19:13,945
I am right in the middle of something...

1137
01:19:15,588 --> 01:19:18,216
...and I don't know
how to get out of it.

1138
01:19:21,327 --> 01:19:24,524
And I am really fucking scared.

1139
01:19:39,879 --> 01:19:41,642
Can...

1140
01:19:42,448 --> 01:19:44,382
...you see how to...

1141
01:19:46,352 --> 01:19:48,616
...make it right?

1142
01:19:54,394 --> 01:19:56,123
Not without...

1143
01:19:57,797 --> 01:20:04,361
Not without ruining everything
I've been working for.

1144
01:20:07,674 --> 01:20:10,165
You're a good man, Francis.

1145
01:20:10,610 --> 01:20:12,578
I don't know how...

1146
01:20:13,046 --> 01:20:14,570
How...

1147
01:20:16,149 --> 01:20:18,310
How you got yourself...

1148
01:20:21,387 --> 01:20:24,948
I trust you with my children.

1149
01:20:25,425 --> 01:20:29,452
I need you to be that man.

1150
01:20:33,933 --> 01:20:36,299
Do you hear what I'm saying?

1151
01:20:37,904 --> 01:20:39,394
Yeah.

1152
01:20:49,515 --> 01:20:51,813
I got your back, Abby.

1153
01:20:54,454 --> 01:20:56,979
<i>A neighbor says she saw</i>
<i>three men she can't identify...</i>

1154
01:20:57,156 --> 01:21:00,614
...get out of a yellow, possibly gold,
'80s Monte Carlo or Grand Prix...

1155
01:21:00,793 --> 01:21:04,160
...and enter the building where
Angel Tezo was later found shot dead.

1156
01:21:04,330 --> 01:21:06,389
EMT on the scene confirmed,
off the record...

1157
01:21:06,566 --> 01:21:09,000
...that the victim suffered
a crushed larynx.

1158
01:21:09,168 --> 01:21:12,103
- At the coroner's office...
- Hey, Carlos, you have a call on one.

1159
01:21:12,271 --> 01:21:13,295
Who is it?
- Won't say.

1160
01:21:13,473 --> 01:21:15,407
<i>killed after exchanging gunfire with...</i>

1161
01:21:15,575 --> 01:21:19,409
The coroner's office has yet
to release a copy of the autopsy report...

1162
01:21:19,579 --> 01:21:21,774
...nor have they returned
any of my phone calls.

- Do I know...? Hey, who is this?

1167
01:21:35,695 --> 01:21:39,654
All right. Okay, slow down.
Slow down. Slow down.

1168
01:21:39,999 --> 01:21:43,230
All right. You have to give me some...

1169
01:21:43,402 --> 01:21:45,461
You have to give me something small.

1170
01:21:49,642 --> 01:21:51,075
Uh-huh.

1171
01:21:56,182 --> 01:21:59,674
Okay. And, look, I'm gonna need a name.

1172
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:48,633
Are you alone?

1173
01:22:48,801 --> 01:22:50,792
Yeah.
- Don't fuck with me, man.

1174
01:22:50,970 --> 01:22:54,929
- I swear to God, don't fuck with me.
- I'm not, man. I'm being straight.

1175
01:22:55,107 --> 01:22:57,735
Nobody knows I'm here,
nobody knows you're here.

1176
01:23:03,549 --> 01:23:05,540
You recording this?

1177
01:23:05,985 --> 01:23:07,543
Do you want me to?

1178
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:08,846
You got a recorder?

1179
01:23:09,021 --> 01:23:10,045
No.

1180
01:23:11,724 --> 01:23:14,352
Then I don't want you to record it.

1181
01:23:14,627 --> 01:23:16,060
Okay.

1182
01:23:18,331 --> 01:23:21,323
All right, look, you could just...
You just talk, all right?

1183
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:24,628
Tell me anything you wanna say,
I won't interrupt you. Say whatever.

1184
01:23:24,804 --> 01:23:27,534
So you can get my story, right?
So you can fuck me.

1185
01:23:27,707 --> 01:23:30,904
- Turn my name to shit, is that it?
- Hey, Sandy. You called me.

1186
01:23:31,077 --> 01:23:33,568
I'm not a priest, I'm a writer.

1187
01:23:34,747 --> 01:23:39,411
I came down here to freeze my ass off
sitting in this fucking car. I did my part.

1188
01:23:42,855 --> 01:23:45,483
I gotta get this out of me.

1189
01:23:47,026 --> 01:23:49,961
- I gotta get this out.
- What?

1190
01:23:50,563 --> 01:23:52,531
We're all dirty.

1191
01:23:54,066 --> 01:23:58,264
We sold our shields off,
highest bidder, murder for hire.

1192
01:24:00,039 --> 01:24:04,203
Stole drugs off dead men, planted shit...

1193
01:24:05,544 --> 01:24:06,636
...beat suspects.

1194
01:24:06,812 --> 01:24:09,747
We robbed and...

1195
01:24:16,756 --> 01:24:20,658
We condemned four of our own to die.

1196
01:24:21,761 --> 01:24:24,025
- What are you talking about?
- Washington Heights.

1197
01:24:24,931 --> 01:24:27,229
We sent them into a slaughter.

1198
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:32,360
- Who? Who, Sandy? Who sent those men?
- I fucking told you, no names!

1199
01:24:32,538 --> 01:24:35,598
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1200
01:24:38,277 --> 01:24:40,507
I can't undo it now.

1201
01:24:41,447 --> 01:24:43,608
There's no atoning.

1202
01:24:44,417 --> 01:24:47,318
I'm gonna burn, man.
I'm gonna fucking burn.

1203
01:24:47,486 --> 01:24:49,920
No, no, no. No, this is...
We can work this out, okay?

1204
01:24:50,089 --> 01:24:53,286
No, no, no.
- Look, I'm gonna call my city desk.

1205
01:24:53,459 --> 01:24:55,893
All right? I'm gonna call my editor.
All right?

1206
01:24:56,062 --> 01:24:59,031
To save space for your story, okay?
Your story.

1207
01:25:00,232 --> 01:25:01,756
Okay?

1208
01:25:03,302 --> 01:25:05,270
Becoming a cop...

1209
01:25:08,174 --> 01:25:10,642
...the respect that earned us...

1210
01:25:14,647 --> 01:25:16,274
...the pledge we took...

1211
01:25:17,483 --> 01:25:20,213
...to uphold something honest...

1212
01:25:20,953 --> 01:25:25,185
Being in the blue, wearing that shield...

1213
01:25:29,795 --> 01:25:32,263
...the pride that I felt...

1214
01:25:34,633 --> 01:25:36,726
...the fucking glory...

1215
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:43,400
We let it all go out from under us.

1216
01:25:52,218 --> 01:25:54,550
I was a good man once.

1217
01:26:51,644 --> 01:26:53,703
Who is it?

1218
01:26:53,879 --> 01:26:55,346
It's Kenny.

1219
01:26:55,514 --> 01:26:56,879
What does he want?

1220
01:26:57,049 --> 01:26:59,711
I just got up.
How the fuck should I know?

1221
01:27:03,355 --> 01:27:05,721
Jesus Christ.

1222
01:27:09,261 --> 01:27:11,354
We're about to get fucked.

1223
01:27:11,530 --> 01:27:13,225
He's dead. Jimmy, he's fucking dead.

1224
01:27:13,399 --> 01:27:14,923
Sandy fucking killed himself.

1225
01:27:15,101 --> 01:27:16,830
Shh. Come on.

1226
01:27:17,002 --> 01:27:18,128
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1227
01:27:18,938 --> 01:27:22,271
...it is with sorrow
and a deep sense of regret...

1228
01:27:22,441 --> 01:27:25,137
...that I appear before you today.

1229
01:27:26,212 --> 01:27:27,975
At 10:30 p.m. last night...

1230
01:27:28,414 --> 01:27:33,010
...Officer Ruben Santiago of the
31 st Precinct in Washington Heights...

1231
01:27:33,752 --> 01:27:35,310
...took his own life.

1232
01:27:35,488 --> 01:27:37,820
Officer Santiago...

1233
01:27:37,990 --> 01:27:41,949
...along with the four officers slain
in Washington Heights...

1234
01:27:42,128 --> 01:27:45,495
...had formed an illicit criminal cabal.

1235
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:49,225
Working in collusion
and under the aegis of the N.Y.P. D...

1236
01:27:49,401 --> 01:27:53,360
...these officers undertook all manner
of criminal misdeed.

1237
01:27:53,539 --> 01:27:56,736
Investigators from Internal Affairs
have isolated the involvement...

1238
01:27:56,909 --> 01:27:59,469
Where the hell have you been?
- of this rogue unit...

1239
01:27:59,645 --> 01:28:01,840
...to the deceased men.
- Yeah, we need to talk.

1240
01:28:02,014 --> 01:28:05,506
- No other officer in 31 st Precinct...
- Yeah, okay. Tonight.

1241
01:28:05,684 --> 01:28:07,879
...has been found culpable of...
- You be there.

1242
01:28:08,053 --> 01:28:11,045
...or in any way linked
to this criminal conspiracy.

1243
01:28:11,223 --> 01:28:13,020
Francis.

1244
01:28:15,327 --> 01:28:17,158
Francis.

1245
01:28:18,130 --> 01:28:19,620
What the hell is going on here?

1246
01:28:19,798 --> 01:28:23,734
- I can't talk, Pop, I gotta go.
- What the hell is going on here, Francis?

1247
01:28:24,069 --> 01:28:26,230
How involved are you?

1248
01:28:27,873 --> 01:28:29,465
Look at me.

1249
01:28:29,642 --> 01:28:31,405
Look at me.

1250
01:28:35,214 --> 01:28:36,909
Did you know what they were doing?

1251
01:28:38,017 --> 01:28:39,951
I knew enough.

1252
01:28:44,590 --> 01:28:48,219
Dad, come on, man. All those years,
you never got jammed up?

1253
01:28:48,394 --> 01:28:51,454
- It never came down on top of you?
- No.

1254
01:28:51,964 --> 01:28:53,397
Because I kept my head up.

1255
01:28:53,566 --> 01:28:56,228
All I took was a check cut by the city.
That's all I took.

1256
01:28:56,402 --> 01:28:58,870
I didn't take any money.
I didn't take a fucking cent.

1257
01:28:59,038 --> 01:29:02,166
Then what? What did you do?

1258
01:29:04,810 --> 01:29:08,211
- I gotta go. I'm sorry.
- Francis, sit down. Let's talk.

1259
01:29:08,380 --> 01:29:11,781
- I'm here to help you, Franny.
- I can't do this now, Pop. I gotta go.

1260
01:29:11,951 --> 01:29:15,751
I gotta do this my way, all right?
I'm sorry.

1261
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:35,586
Happy New Year!

1262
01:29:50,136 --> 01:29:53,230
Happy fucking New Year!

1263
01:29:54,273 --> 01:29:55,968
Taxi!

1264
01:30:08,621 --> 01:30:10,316
Thanks.

1265
01:30:31,010 --> 01:30:32,034
Fuck!

1266
01:30:32,211 --> 01:30:33,940
Move, I'll break it off.

1267
01:30:34,113 --> 01:30:35,239
Who are you?

1268
01:30:35,415 --> 01:30:38,248
Bragon, Carlos Bragon.
I'm a reporter, for chrissake!

1269
01:30:39,052 --> 01:30:41,885
- You know me, Tierney.
- Shut up, shut up!

1270
01:30:42,055 --> 01:30:44,649
You know me, Tierney. You know me.

1271
01:30:46,359 --> 01:30:48,224
Yeah, I know you, you fucking hack.

1272
01:30:48,394 --> 01:30:51,488
What the fuck are you doing following me?
What do you want?

1273
01:30:51,964 --> 01:30:53,727
I'm writing a story.

1274
01:30:53,900 --> 01:30:56,835
I got two versions,
I wanna run them by you.

1275
01:30:57,003 --> 01:30:58,800
First one goes like this:

1276
01:30:58,971 --> 01:31:02,566
Hero detective captures cop killer.
Kills him in self-defense.

1277
01:31:02,742 --> 01:31:04,369
Yeah, what else?

1278
01:31:04,544 --> 01:31:07,570
The other one is key witness
in a cop-corruption case...

1279
01:31:07,747 --> 01:31:11,148
...dies mysteriously in the presence
of cops from the 31 st Precinct.

1280
01:31:11,317 --> 01:31:14,115
- Which one sounds better?
- Whatever sells more papers, right?

1281
01:31:14,287 --> 01:31:17,222
Yeah, I know cops from the 31
were there before you, Ray.

1282
01:31:17,390 --> 01:31:19,483
That's your brother's house, isn't it?

1283
01:31:21,794 --> 01:31:26,788
Sources are telling me that Angel Tezo
was tortured and was executed.

1284
01:31:26,966 --> 01:31:30,299
He had half his teeth shoved down
to his belly, splinters in his throat.

1285
01:31:30,470 --> 01:31:33,234
- You carry a stick?
- Keep pushing me, you're gonna find out.

1286
01:31:33,406 --> 01:31:37,069
I'm trying to help you. Be smart.

1287
01:31:37,744 --> 01:31:39,712
I can be writing a story
about Ray Tierney.

1288
01:31:39,879 --> 01:31:41,972
But I should be writing a story
about the 31.

1289
01:31:45,351 --> 01:31:48,582
You were there. Here's your opportunity
to set it straight right now.

1290
01:31:48,888 --> 01:31:51,152
I don't like my odds with you.

1291
01:31:51,457 --> 01:31:53,982
Last cop you talked to
blew his brains out in your car.

1292
01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:57,254
Last time I saw you, you were
feeding bullshit to the grand jury.

1293
01:31:57,430 --> 01:32:00,888
I was only sitting there
because of your hard-on to crucify cops.

1294
01:32:01,067 --> 01:32:04,127
I do. Because they were protecting
their own and burying the truth.

1295
01:32:04,303 --> 01:32:08,296
Don't talk to me about the truth. You got
no idea what it takes to do what we do.

1296
01:32:08,474 --> 01:32:10,806
- You weren't there.
- You wanna know what I know?

1297
01:32:10,977 --> 01:32:13,411
I know you took a bullet in the face
during the raid.

1298
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:17,179
I know Kareem Aldovise, a 19-year-old
kid, went off that roof and died.

1299
01:32:17,350 --> 01:32:18,374
Everybody knows that.

1300
01:32:18,551 --> 01:32:21,782
Yeah, and I know a witness
saw him surrender before they did it.

1301
01:32:22,488 --> 01:32:25,457
He had no priors, he had no gun.

1302
01:32:26,425 --> 01:32:29,326
You wanna bullshit the grand jury, fine.
Don't do it to me.

1303
01:32:29,495 --> 01:32:33,431
Well, in case you didn't hear, they cleared
us two years ago, okay? Case closed.

1304
01:32:33,599 --> 01:32:37,035
So don't get in my face because you're
skeeved about losing your Pulitzer.

1305
01:32:37,203 --> 01:32:39,296
But you know what?
I don't really think about it that much.

1306
01:32:51,684 --> 01:32:54,653
Wake up, all right? Come on.

1307
01:32:59,492 --> 01:33:01,119
Jimmy!

1308
01:33:01,294 --> 01:33:02,727
Jimmy!

1309
01:33:02,895 --> 01:33:04,157
Help.

1310
01:33:04,330 --> 01:33:06,764
Help me, Jimmy.

1311
01:33:17,910 --> 01:33:19,639
Hey, boss.

1312
01:33:21,247 --> 01:33:22,305
Where is he?

1313
01:33:59,151 --> 01:34:01,676
Have you lost your fucking mind?

1314
01:34:02,154 --> 01:34:06,750
Mayor goes on TV, moans the loss, gives us
a clean bill of health. What's the problem?

1315
01:34:06,926 --> 01:34:10,191
I asked you point-blank, "Were you
involved in this?" What did you say?

1316
01:34:10,363 --> 01:34:11,921
I said what you wanted to hear.

1317
01:34:12,098 --> 01:34:14,566
- I wanted the fucking truth.
- What truth?

1318
01:34:14,734 --> 01:34:18,966
Truth about the money we were getting?
The dirty cops you preside over?

1319
01:34:19,138 --> 01:34:21,606
You knew. All you cared about
was your promotion.

1320
01:34:21,774 --> 01:34:23,639
- I knew what was fucking going on?
- Yeah.

1321
01:34:23,809 --> 01:34:26,801
I gave you room to get the job done.
If you took a little here...

1322
01:34:26,979 --> 01:34:29,106
...I wasn't looking.
But you crossed the line.

1323
01:34:29,282 --> 01:34:32,479
What, you think because you didn't
take an envelope, it absolves you?

1324
01:34:32,652 --> 01:34:34,882
Silk hat, same pig.

1325
01:34:35,054 --> 01:34:37,716
Crimes down, collars up.
It's what you wanted.

1326
01:34:37,890 --> 01:34:40,324
End justifies the means, buddy boy.

1327
01:34:40,493 --> 01:34:42,893
Let me tell you something, Jimmy.

1328
01:34:43,062 --> 01:34:47,590
You think you can set Ray up for this?
You are dead fucking wrong.

1329
01:34:47,767 --> 01:34:51,066
We took you in.
You were a fucking brother to us.

1330
01:34:51,237 --> 01:34:54,729
My sister's your wife, your family's my
family, and you jam us up like this?

1331
01:34:54,907 --> 01:34:58,570
I jam you? I saved you. It's a lay-up, Fran.

1332
01:34:58,744 --> 01:35:01,076
Oh, yeah? How's that, Jimmy?
Run that by me.

1333
01:35:01,247 --> 01:35:04,182
- Ray sticks to the story, he's a hero.
- That's not gonna happen.

1334
01:35:04,350 --> 01:35:07,046
- You're gonna make this right, or I swear...
- Or what?

1335
01:35:07,219 --> 01:35:09,653
What the fuck are you gonna do, Franny?

1336
01:35:09,822 --> 01:35:13,622
You gonna burn down your own house?
Blow up everything you worked for?

1337
01:35:14,460 --> 01:35:16,223
All Ray's gotta do is walk into IAB...

1338
01:35:16,395 --> 01:35:19,762
...say what needs to be said,
end of fucking story.

1339
01:35:19,932 --> 01:35:23,265
- We go home, we go to sleep at night.
- You think this ends that simply?

1340
01:35:23,436 --> 01:35:27,372
We all go to sleep at night. Let me tell you,
what we've done does not get forgiven.

1341
01:35:27,540 --> 01:35:29,974
Here we go with the
Sister Mary Margarets.

1342
01:35:30,142 --> 01:35:31,871
Someone says you're dirty, who cares?

1343
01:35:32,044 --> 01:35:34,239
They say you're fucking corrupt.
Fuck them.

1344
01:35:34,413 --> 01:35:36,404
Do they know how these animals live?

1345
01:35:36,582 --> 01:35:39,050
We tour the sewers, Franny!

1346
01:35:39,218 --> 01:35:42,244
I will not apologize for doing what I do.
I earn 65 grand a year.

1347
01:35:42,421 --> 01:35:46,380
Some fuck like Tezo wipes his ass
with that shit in a week.

1348
01:35:47,994 --> 01:35:50,224
We're in this together, Franny.

1349
01:35:51,063 --> 01:35:54,430
- What the fuck is that?
- It's your cut. I've been keeping it for you.

1350
01:35:54,900 --> 01:35:57,130
Take the fucking money, Franny.

1351
01:35:59,071 --> 01:36:00,902
Take the fucking money, Franny.

1352
01:36:01,974 --> 01:36:04,135
You were my brother, Jimmy.

1353
01:36:04,577 --> 01:36:07,068
Franny. Take...

1354
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:22,320
Fuck.

1355
01:36:42,214 --> 01:36:44,182
Yeah, Tierney.

1356
01:36:47,386 --> 01:36:50,014
Whoa, whoa, whoa. IAB?

1357
01:36:54,260 --> 01:36:57,252
Well, no, no,
but I thought I'd have some time.

1358
01:36:59,465 --> 01:37:01,660
<i>Detective, let me start</i>
<i>by saying we're aware...</i>

1359
01:37:01,834 --> 01:37:04,564
<i>... of your outstanding service record...</i>

1360
01:37:04,737 --> 01:37:07,604
<i>... and we wanna thank you</i>
<i>for your role in solving this case.</i>

1361
01:37:07,773 --> 01:37:11,004
<i>We're gonna make this as brief as possible,</i>
<i>gonna get you out of here.</i>

1362
01:37:11,177 --> 01:37:15,341
<i>We need a statement detailing</i>
<i>your participation in the incident on record.</i>

1363
01:37:15,514 --> 01:37:19,041
<i>Now, you declined to give a
<i>statement at the scene of the shooting.</i>

1364
01:37:19,218 --> 01:37:21,482
- <i>Is that correct?</i>
- <i>That's right.</i>

1365
01:37:21,654 --> 01:37:25,750
Mr. Tezo was tried and sentenced
in a bathroom in the Bronx.

1366
01:37:26,225 --> 01:37:28,159
<i>But you're prepared to give us one now?</i>

1367
01:37:28,327 --> 01:37:29,658
Far removed from a jury.

1368
01:37:29,829 --> 01:37:32,093
- Far removed from a judge.
- <i>I'm gonna do my best.</i>

1369
01:37:32,264 --> 01:37:36,496
<i>Far removed from our basic rights</i>
<i>endowed on all men by our Constitution.</i>

1370
01:37:36,936 --> 01:37:38,597
This march will commence at noon.

1371
01:37:38,771 --> 01:37:42,036
<i>Can you explain how your</i>
<i>investigation led to the apprehension of Tezo?</i>

1372
01:37:42,208 --> 01:37:44,608
- and end up on the steps
of the 31 st Precinct.

1373
01:37:44,777 --> 01:37:48,338
<i>Angel Tezo was identified by</i>
<i>witnesses at the scene of the shooting.</i>

1374
01:37:48,514 --> 01:37:50,982
<i>I sought information</i>
<i>regarding his whereabouts...</i>

1375
01:37:51,150 --> 01:37:53,414
<i>... from a former confidential informant.</i>

1376
01:37:53,586 --> 01:37:56,783
<i>He directed me to the location in question</i>
<i>in Morrisania...</i>

1377
01:37:56,956 --> 01:37:58,617
<i>... and I followed that lead.</i>

1378
01:37:58,791 --> 01:38:03,091
The reverend reiterated
that this planned march is about peace...

1379
01:38:03,262 --> 01:38:08,791
<i>... and is not intended as a condemnation</i>
<i>of the entire N.Y.P.D.</i>

1380
01:38:08,968 --> 01:38:11,493
<i>His target: the 31 st Precinct...</i>

1381
01:38:11,670 --> 01:38:15,401
...and the officers involved in the
Angel Tezo killing.

1382
01:38:15,574 --> 01:38:17,371
The investigation is continuing.

1383
01:38:17,543 --> 01:38:20,979
- Now, did you pursue this lead alone?
- No.

1384
01:38:21,313 --> 01:38:24,373
I called the task force.
I spoke to my colleague, Detective Miller.

1385
01:38:24,550 --> 01:38:28,418
I told him where I was going.
I requested backup, and he initiated that.

1386
01:38:28,587 --> 01:38:30,782
But you arrived on the location alone.

1387
01:38:30,956 --> 01:38:33,481
I arrived before the rest of the team, yes.

1388
01:38:34,727 --> 01:38:36,388
Okay.

1389
01:38:38,664 --> 01:38:42,964
Now, could you describe for us what
transpired at the location in question...

1390
01:38:43,135 --> 01:38:46,400
...leading up to you having to
discharge your weapon?

1391
01:38:56,415 --> 01:38:57,746
Detective?

1392
01:39:13,599 --> 01:39:15,999
This isn't gonna go how you want it to.

1393
01:39:17,203 --> 01:39:18,431
Excuse me?

1394
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:25,704
I know what you guys want me to say...

1395
01:39:26,212 --> 01:39:27,577
...but it's not gonna happen.

1396
01:39:27,746 --> 01:39:31,443
No one's looking for you to say anything
except your version of what happened.

1397
01:39:31,617 --> 01:39:33,812
- Really?
- All we need is a full accounting...

1398
01:39:33,986 --> 01:39:35,851
...of what happened,
then we can go home.

1399
01:39:36,021 --> 01:39:38,046
Yeah, I know what you need.

1400
01:39:38,857 --> 01:39:42,315
But I can't give it to you,
because I didn't shoot him.

1401
01:39:42,494 --> 01:39:45,952
Are you aware that ballistics
has confirmed that the perp was killed...

1402
01:39:46,131 --> 01:39:48,929
<i>... by three bullets fired from your gun</i>
<i>at close range?</i>

1403
01:39:49,101 --> 01:39:50,329
<i>I am.</i>

1404
01:39:50,502 --> 01:39:52,470
<i>But you maintain</i>
<i>that you didn't shoot him?</i>

1405
01:39:52,638 --> 01:39:54,105
<i>I do.</i>

1406
01:39:54,273 --> 01:39:56,798
<i>Could you elaborate on that?</i>
- <i>No, I would not care to.</i>

1407
01:39:56,976 --> 01:39:59,069
<i>What are you saying, detective?</i>

1408
01:39:59,245 --> 01:40:01,679
<i>From here on out, nothing.</i>

1409
01:40:01,847 --> 01:40:04,941
<i>I respectfully refuse</i>
<i>to answer any further questions.</i>

1410
01:40:05,117 --> 01:40:08,177
<i>Are you denying that you</i>
<i>were involved in the Angel Tezo killing?</i>

1411
01:40:08,354 --> 01:40:12,916
<i>I respectfully refuse</i>
<i>to answer any more questions.</i>

1412
01:40:13,092 --> 01:40:15,492
<i>If you don't start answering,</i>
<i>this is gonna go bad.</i>

1413
01:40:15,661 --> 01:40:17,128
<i>We can do this all afternoon...</i>

1414
01:40:17,296 --> 01:40:20,959
<i>... but I have nothing more to say</i>
<i>in this matter.</i>

1415
01:40:22,401 --> 01:40:25,962
<i>This wasn't like Ray. He's not that guy.</i>

1416
01:40:26,138 --> 01:40:28,402
<i>He's a fucking good cop.</i>

1417
01:40:29,441 --> 01:40:31,375
<i>He's a good man.</i>

1418
01:40:32,044 --> 01:40:34,877
<i>He said something about Lonnie Mercer,</i>
<i>"Lonnie and I."</i>

1419
01:40:35,047 --> 01:40:38,710
<i>I remember that they were close.</i>
<i>They were partners.</i>

1420
01:40:38,884 --> 01:40:42,479
<i>Lonnie Mercer, one of the</i>
<i>officers killed in the Washington Heights raid?</i>

1421
01:40:42,655 --> 01:40:43,849
<i>That's right.</i>

1422
01:40:44,023 --> 01:40:45,991
<i>What happened next?</i>

1423
01:40:46,458 --> 01:40:48,187
<i>I tried to revive Mr. Tezo.</i>

1424
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:51,056
<i>I didn't know if he'd had a heart attack...</i>

1425
01:40:51,230 --> 01:40:53,562
<i>... or if he was still alive.</i>
<i>I tried to revive him.</i>

1426
01:40:53,732 --> 01:40:56,599
<i>I checked for a pulse,</i>
<i>I couldn't find a fucking pulse.</i>

1427
01:40:56,769 --> 01:40:58,168
<i>He looked pretty fucking dead.</i>

1428
01:40:59,371 --> 01:41:02,534
<i>So I did some fucking CPR.</i>

1429
01:41:02,708 --> 01:41:07,771
<i>After I tried to revive him,</i>
<i>I was still kneeling over the body.</i>

1430
01:41:10,716 --> 01:41:12,980
<i>That's when the shots went off.</i>

1431
01:41:17,790 --> 01:41:19,553
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

1432
01:41:19,725 --> 01:41:21,420
<i>Who was shot?</i>

1433
01:41:21,593 --> 01:41:24,721
- <i>Mr. Tezo was shot?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1434
01:41:24,897 --> 01:41:27,730
<i>Yeah, he was shot. Yeah, he was shot.</i>

1435
01:41:27,900 --> 01:41:31,165
<i>Got what he fucking deserved.</i>
<i>Got what he fucking deserved.</i>

1436
01:41:31,704 --> 01:41:33,831
<i>Who shot Mr. Tezo?</i>

1437
01:41:37,276 --> 01:41:39,938
<i>I would've done the same thing myself.</i>

1438
01:41:40,112 --> 01:41:43,411
<i>Who shot Angel Tezo, Sergeant Egan?</i>

1439
01:41:49,188 --> 01:41:51,247
<i>Detective Tierney.</i>

1440
01:41:52,825 --> 01:41:55,316
<i>Detective Raymond Tierney?</i>

1441
01:42:01,266 --> 01:42:02,631
<i>Yes.</i>

1442
01:42:13,278 --> 01:42:15,007
Listen, Frank...

1443
01:42:15,180 --> 01:42:20,675
...I know how this must feel,
and I wish I knew what to say.

1444
01:42:21,787 --> 01:42:26,622
But you should know that these officers
are all prepared to testify at a grand jury.

1445
01:42:27,459 --> 01:42:30,257
So what's critical now,
from here on out...

1446
01:42:30,429 --> 01:42:34,490
...is that we handle this thing quietly,
with as little incident as possible.

1447
01:42:34,666 --> 01:42:37,134
He's not capable of that.

1448
01:42:37,736 --> 01:42:39,601
I know my son. He's not capable of that.

1449
01:42:39,772 --> 01:42:43,071
Frank, we're gonna have to bring Ray in.

1450
01:42:50,849 --> 01:42:52,407
You okay?

1451
01:42:53,051 --> 01:42:54,712
Hey.

1452
01:42:59,958 --> 01:43:01,892
I'm proud of you.

1453
01:43:03,629 --> 01:43:05,722
Call me when it's done.

1454
01:43:06,598 --> 01:43:10,591
<i>They wanna take you in,</i>
<i>put "arrest pending" in the press tomorrow.</i>

1455
01:43:10,769 --> 01:43:13,602
I'm sitting there on my ass,
watching this fucking testimony.

1456
01:43:13,772 --> 01:43:15,797
You believe that shit
that Jimmy's spinning?

1457
01:43:15,974 --> 01:43:20,070
- You gonna tell me you believe that?
- Of course not. That's not the point.

1458
01:43:20,245 --> 01:43:23,772
I told you to run everything through me
and that we would handle it.

1459
01:43:23,949 --> 01:43:27,112
And then you sit down
with the goddamn IAB...

1460
01:43:27,286 --> 01:43:28,685
...and don't give me a heads up?

1461
01:43:28,854 --> 01:43:31,118
No fucking phone call?
You don't talk to me, Ray.

1462
01:43:31,290 --> 01:43:33,258
I'm here. I'm telling you now, okay?

1463
01:43:33,425 --> 01:43:36,622
Listen to me. Jimmy is a drug dealer, Pop.

1464
01:43:36,795 --> 01:43:40,128
He murdered that guy, and Fran is in it.
Pop, he's in up to his neck.

1465
01:43:40,299 --> 01:43:44,463
Now, I tried. I tried to talk to Fran,
and when I sat in there with those guys...

1466
01:43:44,636 --> 01:43:48,367
...I gave them nothing.
I said as little as I could say.

1467
01:43:48,540 --> 01:43:53,477
But if Jimmy's gonna box me in, I gotta tell
them what I know. I got no fucking choice.

1468
01:43:53,645 --> 01:43:55,772
The fuck you got no choice.

1469
01:43:55,948 --> 01:43:58,610
You could've taken that lay-up
that they were handing you.

1470
01:43:58,784 --> 01:44:01,582
- Oh, no. No, Pop.
- And saved us a fucking mess.

1471
01:44:01,753 --> 01:44:03,516
Come on. What good would it have done?

1472
01:44:03,689 --> 01:44:07,523
Jimmy's a scumbag. Jesus.
We'll take care of him.

1473
01:44:07,693 --> 01:44:11,754
But we got a hole that needs
to get plugged up...

1474
01:44:11,930 --> 01:44:14,160
...before it takes down
half the department.

1475
01:44:14,833 --> 01:44:16,130
It's too late, Pop.

1476
01:44:17,002 --> 01:44:19,334
We protect our own, Ray.

1477
01:44:19,505 --> 01:44:23,168
That is all I know. We protect our own.
You gotta show me some fucking loyalty.

1478
01:44:23,342 --> 01:44:27,904
No. Don't use that word with me. It doesn't
mean shit to me anymore, you know that?

1479
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:29,980
I done your loyalty. It cost me too much.

1480
01:44:30,148 --> 01:44:33,311
- What did it cost you?
- It cost me everything!

1481
01:44:33,919 --> 01:44:36,513
It cost me the woman that I love.

1482
01:44:38,123 --> 01:44:40,853
Because she told me that we were wrong
on Mott Haven.

1483
01:44:41,026 --> 01:44:42,391
She told me. I didn't listen.

1484
01:44:42,561 --> 01:44:45,496
Look, you said you weren't sure about
what you saw. I heard it.

1485
01:44:45,664 --> 01:44:48,360
You heard what you wanted to hear.
Don't bullshit me.

1486
01:44:48,534 --> 01:44:51,867
It was a lie to protect a bad cop,
and you knew it, and I knew it.

1487
01:44:52,037 --> 01:44:54,733
And I got up there and said it
in front of the grand jury.

1488
01:44:54,907 --> 01:44:56,602
- I got it.
- I'm not gonna do this.

1489
01:44:56,775 --> 01:44:58,640
- Not for you.
- I'm responsible, huh?

1490
01:44:58,810 --> 01:45:03,008
- This is my responsibility, this shit?
- No. We did wrong. I wanna hear you say it.

1491
01:45:03,181 --> 01:45:04,580
Both of you, stop the yelling.

1492
01:45:04,750 --> 01:45:06,877
- Get out of here, Mo.
- No. Stop it.

1493
01:45:07,052 --> 01:45:08,747
- Get out of here.
- I am not leaving.

1494
01:45:08,921 --> 01:45:10,411
- This is not for you.
- No, no.

1495
01:45:10,589 --> 01:45:12,853
- I am not leaving.
- I don't want you hearing this.

1496
01:45:13,025 --> 01:45:14,549
Hey, hey, hey. Dad, take it easy.

1497
01:45:14,726 --> 01:45:17,456
- Don't yell at her.
- Get upstairs.

1498
01:45:18,497 --> 01:45:19,691
This is too much.

1499
01:45:38,283 --> 01:45:41,480
Now, you listen to me,
and you listen good.

1500
01:45:41,653 --> 01:45:43,712
This is not just about the department.

1501
01:45:43,889 --> 01:45:46,483
That's not what we're talking about here.

1502
01:45:46,658 --> 01:45:49,286
This is family. This is our way of life.

1503
01:45:49,461 --> 01:45:50,928
Jimmy is married to your sister.

1504
01:45:51,096 --> 01:45:54,896
He's the father of her children,
for chrissake.

1505
01:45:55,067 --> 01:45:59,401
And your brother is in a bad hour here,
and the only way through this is you.

1506
01:45:59,571 --> 01:46:01,835
You're the only door.

1507
01:46:02,474 --> 01:46:06,274
Jimmy is gonna take back his story.
I'll see to that.

1508
01:46:06,445 --> 01:46:09,539
And you just follow the crumbs
like they're laid out for you.

1509
01:46:09,715 --> 01:46:11,979
Take a deep breath
and say what needs to be said.

1510
01:46:12,150 --> 01:46:16,678
Like you believe it with every bone of your
body, and then we move through this thing.

1511
01:46:16,855 --> 01:46:20,018
- And that's what you're gonna do.
- No.

1512
01:46:20,726 --> 01:46:23,160
No, he's not gonna do that, Pop.

1513
01:46:25,397 --> 01:46:29,561
- Franny, listen.
- Ray is not getting hung out for what I did.

1514
01:46:29,735 --> 01:46:30,929
What I did.

1515
01:46:31,603 --> 01:46:33,594
He'll get a slap on the wrist,
nothing more.

1516
01:46:33,772 --> 01:46:36,639
- You're not thinking clearly, Franny.
- Yeah, I am.

1517
01:46:36,808 --> 01:46:42,178
Listen to me, Pop. This shit ends now.

1518
01:46:42,347 --> 01:46:44,212
Tonight.

1519
01:46:46,318 --> 01:46:49,651
And if that means
I can't be a cop anymore...

1520
01:46:50,689 --> 01:46:52,384
...I'm okay with that.

1521
01:47:09,841 --> 01:47:11,274
What do you want me to do?

1522
01:47:12,744 --> 01:47:16,202
We're gonna get Jimmy.
That's what we're gonna do.

1523
01:47:17,215 --> 01:47:19,376
Yeah. Okay.

1524
01:47:35,367 --> 01:47:37,801
Just gonna make a stop over here.

1525
01:47:38,170 --> 01:47:39,967
Real quick.

1526
01:47:41,673 --> 01:47:43,470
What are you doing?

1527
01:47:43,809 --> 01:47:45,333
I gotta pick something up.

1528
01:47:45,510 --> 01:47:47,978
Picking up what?
Whoa, whoa, what the fuck is that?

1529
01:47:48,146 --> 01:47:51,343
- I gotta make a collection.
- A collection with a gun? Jesus, come on.

1530
01:47:51,516 --> 01:47:53,950
Jimmy told us to lay low.
Stay under the radar.

1531
01:47:54,119 --> 01:47:57,418
- You know what? Fuck Jimmy.
- Fuck Jimmy? What are you talking about?

1532
01:47:57,589 --> 01:48:00,387
- Jimmy's looking out for us.
- Jimmy ain't looking out for me!

1533
01:48:00,559 --> 01:48:05,223
He ain't paying my fucking rent! I got no
fucking money in my pocket. I'm broke!

1534
01:48:05,397 --> 01:48:08,195
- Jeez, you coming with me or not?
- No, I'm not coming, Eddie.

1535
01:48:08,366 --> 01:48:11,358
- Do what you wanna do. Stay here.
- I will fucking stay here.

1536
01:48:17,576 --> 01:48:19,271
Yo, bro.

1537
01:48:36,828 --> 01:48:40,195
No, I'm not a fucking cop anymore.
Get the fuck out of here.

1538
01:48:43,068 --> 01:48:45,263
You gotta do this every time?

1539
01:48:46,738 --> 01:48:49,468
Let's fucking go, Eddie. Let's go.

1540
01:48:51,943 --> 01:48:53,467
- Shit, Eddie!
- Get down. get down.

1541
01:48:53,645 --> 01:48:56,170
Eddie, fucking... Eddie.

1542
01:48:56,348 --> 01:48:58,111
I see how it is.

1543
01:48:58,283 --> 01:49:02,515
Out of the store. I'm a cop. Out of the
fucking store. Get the fuck out of the store!

1544
01:49:02,687 --> 01:49:05,212
Give me the fucking gun.
Give me the fucking gun now.

1545
01:49:05,390 --> 01:49:10,191
Get down! Get the fuck down!
Out now! Go.

1546
01:49:10,362 --> 01:49:12,887
He got a gun, man.
- You! You!

1547
01:49:13,899 --> 01:49:17,357
- You!
- Oh, shit.

1548
01:49:17,536 --> 01:49:19,367
Yo, that's that nigga right there.

1549
01:49:28,013 --> 01:49:29,446
<i>That's what I said.</i>
- You sure?

1550
01:49:29,614 --> 01:49:31,605
<i>Yes, I'm sure.</i>

1551
01:49:31,850 --> 01:49:34,785
No, I can't talk right now, Megan.

1552
01:49:36,087 --> 01:49:38,146
I know it, I'm with him.

1553
01:49:39,191 --> 01:49:41,284
No, we'll call you soon.

1554
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:42,886
Okay.

1555
01:49:45,897 --> 01:49:48,127
He's at Irish Eyes.

1556
01:49:50,969 --> 01:49:53,699
You motherfucker, unlock that door!

1557
01:49:53,872 --> 01:49:58,468
You stupid, stupid idiot, Eddie.
You fucking...

1558
01:50:02,180 --> 01:50:04,876
How do I get out of here?

1559
01:50:05,050 --> 01:50:06,574
Is there another way out of here?

1560
01:50:06,751 --> 01:50:08,810
Tell me.
Is there another way out of here?

1561
01:50:15,460 --> 01:50:18,327
- Back door.
- Fucking show me. Show me!

1562
01:50:18,496 --> 01:50:20,088
Goddamn it. Go right or left?

1563
01:50:20,265 --> 01:50:21,857
Left.

1564
01:50:24,536 --> 01:50:27,437
Oh, shit! Is there another fucking exit?

1565
01:50:27,606 --> 01:50:29,335
No, fuck it. Don't talk.

1566
01:50:29,507 --> 01:50:32,135
<i>Callback, Central.</i>
- <i>Stand by, units.</i>

1567
01:50:34,746 --> 01:50:36,509
- Tierney.
<i>We got a 10-30 on Audubon.</i>

1568
01:50:36,681 --> 01:50:40,139
- I know. It's coming over the radio.
- <i>That ain't the problem, I got a riot.</i>

1569
01:50:40,318 --> 01:50:42,843
Wait, man, slow down.
I can't understand you. What?

1570
01:50:43,021 --> 01:50:45,683
<i>Looks like it's two guys from</i>
<i>your command. Two SNEU guys.</i>

1571
01:50:46,224 --> 01:50:47,782
Who?

1572
01:50:49,761 --> 01:50:51,558
I'm on my way.

1573
01:50:52,197 --> 01:50:53,687
It's Dugan and Carbone.

1574
01:50:53,865 --> 01:50:56,095
<i>I'm gonna need units for crowd control.</i>

1575
01:50:56,268 --> 01:50:57,565
You gotta go.

1576
01:50:57,736 --> 01:50:59,863
I'll get Jimmy.

1577
01:51:00,038 --> 01:51:01,699
Destroy that piece of shit!

1578
01:51:13,551 --> 01:51:16,247
I fucking told you not to do it.

1579
01:51:24,796 --> 01:51:27,663
Chief Tierney,
I'm Captain Lavier from Internal Affairs.

1580
01:51:27,832 --> 01:51:30,960
Have a warrant for your son's arrest.
We'd like him to come with us.

1581
01:51:31,136 --> 01:51:33,229
What makes you think he's here?

1582
01:51:33,805 --> 01:51:34,999
Car's outside.

1583
01:51:35,840 --> 01:51:38,001
Got a message? I'll tell him.

1584
01:51:38,176 --> 01:51:41,634
- How about if I come in myself and tell him?
- No, you're not invited.

1585
01:51:41,813 --> 01:51:45,305
Now, get the hell off my porch
and take your boys with you.

1586
01:51:46,484 --> 01:51:47,917
Let's go.

1587
01:51:48,086 --> 01:51:50,486
You can tell your superiors I said so.

1588
01:51:51,756 --> 01:51:52,950
Let's go.

1589
01:51:57,696 --> 01:52:00,961
They got the fucking place surrounded.
Just get down here, Jimmy.

1590
01:52:02,634 --> 01:52:04,465
We'll meet back here.

1591
01:52:15,680 --> 01:52:18,342
What's going down in there? Pepe okay?

1592
01:52:18,883 --> 01:52:21,317
I hope Pepe killed 20
of you motherfuckers.

1593
01:52:21,486 --> 01:52:23,454
Let's go. Move back.

1594
01:52:24,322 --> 01:52:26,517
Do you believe this shit?

1595
01:52:26,691 --> 01:52:30,252
- We got any communication established?
- I requested Hostage Negotiation, sir.

1596
01:52:30,428 --> 01:52:32,726
They give you an ETA?
- Not yet, sir.

1597
01:52:32,897 --> 01:52:36,492
All right.
I want this perimeter pushed back.

1598
01:52:36,668 --> 01:52:39,637
Big Stevie, Ponch, you're my shooters.

1599
01:52:42,073 --> 01:52:43,768
I'm going in.

1600
01:52:44,275 --> 01:52:45,799
Boss.

1601
01:52:45,977 --> 01:52:48,070
These are my guys.

1602
01:52:48,380 --> 01:52:49,813
I'm going in.

1603
01:53:00,725 --> 01:53:03,319
Where is everybody? Get over there!

1604
01:53:03,495 --> 01:53:05,326
Let's go, move it!

1605
01:53:05,497 --> 01:53:08,261
Fuck, man. Come on, hurry up.

1606
01:53:13,738 --> 01:53:17,105
They knocked my tooth out. Black and blue.
My whole family disrespected.

1607
01:53:17,275 --> 01:53:19,402
These motherfuckers!

1608
01:53:27,652 --> 01:53:30,519
Whoa. Whoa, man, easy.

1609
01:53:30,688 --> 01:53:32,849
Kenny, easy.

1610
01:53:33,024 --> 01:53:34,924
Let's not lose our heads here.

1611
01:53:35,093 --> 01:53:36,617
I'm gonna fucking kill him, boss.

1612
01:53:36,795 --> 01:53:40,128
Kenny, just keep it calm, all right?
It's just me.

1613
01:53:40,498 --> 01:53:42,762
Get them motherfuckers out of here!
It's on.

1614
01:53:43,368 --> 01:53:46,860
I swear to Jesus Christ,
I will fucking kill him, Franny.

1615
01:53:52,610 --> 01:53:55,238
In about two minutes,
we got everybody showing up here.

1616
01:53:55,413 --> 01:53:59,144
You do not want that to happen. You do not
want me to lose control of this scene.

1617
01:53:59,317 --> 01:54:01,842
Do not fucking play me, Franny.

1618
01:54:02,020 --> 01:54:05,649
There's no play here, Kenny.
There's no fucking play.

1619
01:54:06,391 --> 01:54:09,326
You wanna talk to me or
you wanna talk to a stranger?

1620
01:54:11,563 --> 01:54:12,587
Kenny.

1621
01:54:13,131 --> 01:54:14,962
Open the door.

1622
01:54:46,664 --> 01:54:49,690
Police. I want everyone
out of this bar right now.

1623
01:54:52,837 --> 01:54:54,634
You too, Mac.

1624
01:55:16,394 --> 01:55:19,522
You got anything you wanna say to me
about what you've done?

1625
01:55:21,032 --> 01:55:23,364
You left me no choice, Ray.

1626
01:55:23,868 --> 01:55:26,928
Push to shove, it's me and mine.
It's Megan and the kids.

1627
01:55:27,272 --> 01:55:29,763
After that, it's every swinging dick
for himself.

1628
01:55:30,008 --> 01:55:32,670
You broke our fucking hearts, Jimmy.

1629
01:55:35,413 --> 01:55:37,711
Lot of hearts broken, Ray.

1630
01:55:39,984 --> 01:55:41,679
There's a lot of hearts broken.

1631
01:55:50,094 --> 01:55:52,289
So how do you think this ends?

1632
01:55:56,067 --> 01:55:57,261
You gonna take me in?

1633
01:55:58,603 --> 01:56:00,901
Take your gun out and put it on the bar.

1634
01:57:26,858 --> 01:57:28,849
Turn on me, Ray!

1635
01:57:29,027 --> 01:57:33,430
- I'm so fucking tired.
- Fuck you. Fuck you.

1636
01:58:12,136 --> 01:58:16,436
I'm gonna send in a crew! Open it up!
Let's go, let's go!

1637
01:58:52,910 --> 01:58:54,935
Back! Everybody step back.

1638
01:58:58,716 --> 01:59:00,411
You gotta push these guys back.

1639
01:59:29,313 --> 01:59:31,247
Ray. Ray.
- Shut up, Jimmy.

1640
01:59:31,416 --> 01:59:33,509
- Move. Move.
- Ray.

1641
01:59:35,253 --> 01:59:37,380
That's him. That's that nigga Egan. Go.

1642
01:59:37,555 --> 01:59:39,216
- Get behind me.
- Take the cuffs off.

1643
01:59:39,390 --> 01:59:41,483
- Shut up. Get behind me.
- Yo, that's him!

1644
01:59:41,659 --> 01:59:45,891
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Right there. Police
officer. Stay back. This man's under arrest.

1645
01:59:46,063 --> 01:59:48,327
Take the cuffs off, give me my gun.
- Shut up.

1646
01:59:48,499 --> 01:59:50,467
We want Egan, not you.
Walk away, you live.

1647
01:59:50,635 --> 01:59:52,330
Fuck you! Stay back.

1648
01:59:52,503 --> 01:59:54,471
- I'm not kidding.
- You gonna kill everybody?

1649
01:59:54,639 --> 01:59:56,504
Try me.
- They're gonna tear us apart.

1650
01:59:56,674 --> 02:00:00,132
- This ain't your fight.
- That nigga's dead. Give me that stick.

1651
02:00:00,311 --> 02:00:02,575
You walk out with me right now.
Let's go.

1652
02:00:05,249 --> 02:00:06,409
Jimmy!

1653
02:00:09,353 --> 02:00:10,843
Let him be. Let him be.

1654
02:00:11,022 --> 02:00:12,455
- You motherfuckers!
- Back off!

1655
02:00:12,623 --> 02:00:13,851
Jimmy!
- Back the fuck off!

1656
02:00:14,025 --> 02:00:15,424
Jimmy!
Back off!

1657
02:00:15,593 --> 02:00:17,618
Back off! Nigga's mine.
This nigga's mine!

1658
02:00:17,795 --> 02:00:21,731
Get off of me, you motherfuckers!
You motherfuckers!

1659
02:00:22,233 --> 02:00:25,293
No! Don't you do it!
Don't you fucking do it!

1660
02:00:26,237 --> 02:00:27,727
Tell her I love her.

1661
02:00:27,905 --> 02:00:30,874
Don't you fucking do it! No! Jimmy!

1662
02:00:31,042 --> 02:00:33,806
No! No! Don't fucking do it!

1663
02:00:33,978 --> 02:00:35,275
Don't you do it!

1664
02:00:38,416 --> 02:00:39,474
Jimmy.

1665
02:01:17,121 --> 02:01:19,954
Detective Tierney. Your CO's my brother.

1666
02:01:20,124 --> 02:01:21,921
You all right?
- Yeah. I'm all right.

1667
02:01:22,093 --> 02:01:23,856
- You sure?
- I'm all right.

1668
02:01:58,029 --> 02:02:00,964
You go find him, I got the brief.
- Okay. Great job, boss.

1669
02:02:01,132 --> 02:02:02,622
Thanks.

1670
02:02:03,367 --> 02:02:07,736
Hi, chief. Couple of my suspended guys
were involved in this 30...

1671
02:02:28,726 --> 02:02:30,557
The fuck happened to you?

1672
02:02:31,896 --> 02:02:33,329
What?

1673
02:02:34,799 --> 02:02:35,823
Where's Jimmy?

1674
02:02:41,839 --> 02:02:42,897
Let's go home.
