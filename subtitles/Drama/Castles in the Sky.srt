1
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:22,041
One. Two. Three. Ah, that's equal.

2
00:00:22,641 --> 00:00:24,441
One. Two. Three.

3
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:27,641
That's you... Ah...
What is this here?

4
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:30,201
Uncle Robert!

5
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:32,761
Making the invisible visible!

6
00:00:32,801 --> 00:00:34,881
- Lunch is ready.
- Ah... Perfect!

7
00:00:34,921 --> 00:00:36,361
Thank you, Aunty Margaret.

8
00:00:36,401 --> 00:00:38,881
Ooh, what's going on here?

9
00:00:38,921 --> 00:00:40,641
Making invisible things appear.

10
00:00:40,681 --> 00:00:43,321
And then disappear.
Like sandwiches.

11
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:41,121
No one comes in.

12
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,481
Even if the building's on fire.

13
00:02:43,521 --> 00:02:45,041
No one.

14
00:02:50,961 --> 00:02:52,801
This shows that the Germans
are working night and day!

15
00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:55,561
So if tension should rise
and if conflict -

16
00:02:55,601 --> 00:02:58,481
As I have been saying for some time now,
it's not a question of 'if', Mr Tizard,

17
00:02:58,521 --> 00:03:00,041
it's a question of 'when'.

18
00:03:00,081 --> 00:03:01,121
I don't think that necessarily...

19
00:03:01,161 --> 00:03:03,641
We have to work night and day
to build up our own reserves and weapons.

20
00:03:03,681 --> 00:03:06,001
Even if we had enough money
we'd still never catch up.

21
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,201
We have to overtake them.

22
00:03:10,081 --> 00:03:12,401
We have to build a death ray.

23
00:03:13,001 --> 00:03:14,161
'A death ray'?

24
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:18,441
A ground-based weapon system
that focuses radio waves on enemy aircraft

25
00:03:18,481 --> 00:03:22,321
and boils the pilots to death
in their cockpits in a matter of seconds.

26
00:03:22,881 --> 00:03:25,241
Is such a thing possible?

27
00:03:25,281 --> 00:03:28,921
I think these things, you pick
the right people, then they build it.

28
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:30,841
We can make anything happen.

29
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:32,961
Let's see who has got some ideas, sir.

30
00:03:33,001 --> 00:03:34,961
I'll put out some feelers.

31
00:03:35,001 --> 00:03:38,361
We'll have to disguise it somehow,
keep a lid on it.

32
00:03:38,401 --> 00:03:40,401
No need to alarm anyone.

33
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:42,361
I will continue to put
pressure on the director

34
00:03:42,441 --> 00:03:46,121
to let me set up a new committee
for aerial weapon development.

35
00:03:46,201 --> 00:03:48,641
As we know, there is a
limited pot of money available

36
00:03:48,681 --> 00:03:53,321
and the pacifists in the cabinet continue to...
- Sorry, Professor Lindemann...

37
00:03:53,361 --> 00:03:55,721
I am afraid
that committee already exists...

38
00:03:57,601 --> 00:03:59,561
- Excuse me?
- I'm sorry.

39
00:04:00,801 --> 00:04:03,081
Who is chairing this committee?

40
00:04:07,241 --> 00:04:09,001
I see.

41
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:13,521
I rather wish
I'd done the washing now.

42
00:04:14,601 --> 00:04:16,921
I was told it was going to rain.

43
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:20,841
It does look like there's a change in the air.
- How can you tell?

44
00:04:20,881 --> 00:04:25,281
Studying the clouds,
watching how they are moving,

45
00:04:25,321 --> 00:04:26,441
barometric pressure...

46
00:04:26,481 --> 00:04:27,801
Excuse me.

47
00:04:27,841 --> 00:04:28,961
- Hello, Skip!
- Hi.

48
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:31,601
Sorry to disturb on your day off an' all...

49
00:04:32,401 --> 00:04:34,081
We've had a telegram...

50
00:05:09,121 --> 00:05:10,961
You asked the impossible.

51
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:13,201
By using radio waves only

52
00:05:13,241 --> 00:05:16,641
could we raise the temperature
of eight pint glasses of water

53
00:05:16,681 --> 00:05:19,281
to one hundred and five
degrees Fahrenheit?

54
00:05:19,321 --> 00:05:20,601
You... did it?

55
00:05:20,641 --> 00:05:21,601
Indeed.

56
00:05:21,641 --> 00:05:24,641
We were forced to make one or two slight
alterations to the test conditions...

57
00:05:24,681 --> 00:05:26,161
Very slight alterations.

58
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:27,601
Such as?

59
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:32,081
To achieve the desired outcome we reduced
the distance originally proposed.

60
00:05:32,121 --> 00:05:34,201
And neither did you use radio waves.

61
00:05:35,161 --> 00:05:39,041
Forgive me for being a little...
reductive here

62
00:05:39,081 --> 00:05:44,121
but would it be fair to say that in your
experiment you essentially... boiled a kettle?

63
00:05:55,361 --> 00:05:57,321
We failed in our objective...

64
00:05:57,361 --> 00:06:01,721
But we stumbled across
something all together different!

65
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:04,401
By transmitting high-energy waves

66
00:06:04,441 --> 00:06:09,761
we think it may be possible
to deafen laboratory rats.

67
00:06:22,481 --> 00:06:25,081
Hello, yes, right,
I know what you are up to.

68
00:06:25,121 --> 00:06:28,041
You're worried about the Germans.

69
00:06:29,921 --> 00:06:31,641
Eight pints of water
equal eight pints of blood.

70
00:06:31,681 --> 00:06:33,521
The distance and height
you specified - an aeroplane.

71
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:36,041
Ergo - you're wanting
some kind of a weapon

72
00:06:36,081 --> 00:06:40,161
that will vaporise pilots
in their cockpits, aren't you?

73
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:42,681
Sorry!

74
00:06:42,721 --> 00:06:46,281
I haven't slept since I received
your telegram, barely stopped work!

75
00:06:46,321 --> 00:06:48,881
Goodness knows
what my wife must think!

76
00:06:49,761 --> 00:06:51,441
I'm Robert Watson-Watt!

77
00:06:51,481 --> 00:06:53,081
You told your wife about this?

78
00:06:53,801 --> 00:06:55,601
Should I have?

79
00:06:55,641 --> 00:06:57,961
Will you begin your
presentation, please?

80
00:06:58,001 --> 00:07:00,841
The thing you propose doesn't work.

81
00:07:00,881 --> 00:07:04,041
It never will work.
No one will ever get it to work.

82
00:07:04,081 --> 00:07:07,001
Probably cause more damage
to the operator than the enemy.

83
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:10,321
So you're here to...?
Offer you something that will.

84
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:14,521
Now, I have an idea
for a listening device...

85
00:07:14,561 --> 00:07:17,041
Listening devices don't work,
we've already built sound mirrors...

86
00:07:17,081 --> 00:07:18,041
This isn't a sound mirror!

87
00:07:18,081 --> 00:07:20,841
As Baldwin said,
'the bomber will always get through'.

88
00:07:20,881 --> 00:07:25,241
How exciting would it be
to prove him wrong?

89
00:07:27,401 --> 00:07:29,641
It's night-time, you're in the woods.

90
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:34,441
The enemy is out there somewhere
but you don't know exactly where

91
00:07:34,481 --> 00:07:38,561
so you tie a length of fishing line...

92
00:07:39,121 --> 00:07:41,201
between two trees...

93
00:07:43,321 --> 00:07:46,081
and then you hang a bell off of it.

94
00:07:46,121 --> 00:07:50,281
The enemy comes along, touches the line,
which rings the bell...

95
00:07:51,801 --> 00:07:53,521
and we know where he is.

96
00:07:54,601 --> 00:07:58,281
So we use fishing line and bells
to enable us to hear our enemies.

97
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:00,641
Jolly good.

98
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:02,641
Good. Thank you for your time, Mr...

99
00:08:02,681 --> 00:08:06,921
But instead of trees we have antennae!

100
00:08:06,961 --> 00:08:09,481
And if I may, thank you very much.

101
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:13,161
So we have radio antennae.

102
00:08:15,921 --> 00:08:18,441
Now, they send out pulses

103
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:22,321
which are like a fishing line.

104
00:08:22,361 --> 00:08:26,081
And then if something comes along

105
00:08:27,401 --> 00:08:30,801
the waves will bounce off

106
00:08:32,281 --> 00:08:38,241
and that rings the bell here
and then we can see them.

107
00:08:50,521 --> 00:08:53,201
- He's an idiot.
- Perhaps.

108
00:08:54,001 --> 00:08:56,801
But out of all the ideas
we've heard today...

109
00:08:57,681 --> 00:09:01,561
His is the... least idiotic?

110
00:09:02,481 --> 00:09:04,681
We have to do something.

111
00:09:05,481 --> 00:09:07,881
Get him to give you
a field demonstration.

112
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:11,401
I thought you said
it would be a clear day?

113
00:09:11,441 --> 00:09:13,201
That's weather for you!

114
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:14,801
Indeed.

115
00:09:14,841 --> 00:09:15,921
We are going again!

116
00:09:18,161 --> 00:09:19,641
It's not budging!

117
00:09:29,521 --> 00:09:32,361
This... This is fine!

118
00:09:32,921 --> 00:09:35,721
Come on. Let's get the equipment!
We've got forty minutes!

119
00:09:46,001 --> 00:09:46,921
Who are you?

120
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,321
I'm his chief assistant.

121
00:09:50,721 --> 00:09:54,281
So we are tuned in
on the 50 metre wavelength

122
00:09:54,321 --> 00:09:57,721
waiting for 6Mhz transmission
from Daventry

123
00:09:57,761 --> 00:10:00,281
with at least 10kw of power...

124
00:10:01,241 --> 00:10:04,041
This man appears to be living
in cloud cuckoo land.

125
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:06,721
You have absolutely
no faith in him, have you?

126
00:10:06,761 --> 00:10:10,481
He's building a washing line...
in the rain.

127
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:16,041
That is going to terrify the Luftwaffe.

128
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,081
We have two aerials...

129
00:10:23,121 --> 00:10:24,761
one in front and one behind.

130
00:10:24,801 --> 00:10:28,481
We have a BBC transmitter sending out...
Where's the transmitter?

131
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:30,601
Er, over there, in Daventry.

132
00:10:30,641 --> 00:10:36,441
Now, that's sending out pulses
which get reflected down off an aircraft.

133
00:10:36,481 --> 00:10:39,441
These pulses are in effect like our trap.

134
00:10:40,601 --> 00:10:42,841
The fishing line in the woods.
Exactly!

135
00:10:43,521 --> 00:10:48,081
So now we wait for something to hit it
and ring the bell, so to speak?

136
00:10:48,121 --> 00:10:49,201
Yes.

137
00:10:59,841 --> 00:11:00,841
Nothing.

138
00:11:01,201 --> 00:11:03,961
The receiver is tuned
to Daventry, isn't it?

139
00:11:07,481 --> 00:11:09,001
What are you doing?
Well, if...

140
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:11,761
Just leave it, will you!
Come on...

141
00:11:12,521 --> 00:11:14,001
It's there.

142
00:11:14,761 --> 00:11:17,161
It's... actually... there.

143
00:11:21,241 --> 00:11:25,721
We saw you! We - saw - YOU!

144
00:11:31,361 --> 00:11:34,321
I need to get out of this field
and find a telephone.

145
00:11:43,601 --> 00:11:46,321
We didn't see it
till it was right on top of us.

146
00:11:46,361 --> 00:11:49,281
But we saw it. We saw a plane.

147
00:11:50,201 --> 00:11:52,241
Unfortunately we can't prove it.

148
00:11:52,281 --> 00:11:54,841
The trace recorder failed.
Oh no.

149
00:11:55,561 --> 00:11:59,761
Well, we'll just have to do it all over
again and hope it records next time.

150
00:12:00,601 --> 00:12:02,681
It did work, didn't it?

151
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:04,881
I mean, we didn't imagine it? Did we?

152
00:12:04,921 --> 00:12:06,721
Now we'll have to build
our own transmitter.

153
00:12:06,761 --> 00:12:08,801
This was just a test.

154
00:12:08,841 --> 00:12:10,881
There are a million and one
things against us, Rob.

155
00:12:10,921 --> 00:12:13,641
And we will overcome them all.

156
00:12:26,561 --> 00:12:31,521
Despite your lack of appropriate
qualifications I've spoken with the ministry.

157
00:12:31,561 --> 00:12:34,961
And we have recognised
the success of the test.

158
00:12:35,361 --> 00:12:37,801
And we would like to proceed
to the next stage of development.

159
00:12:39,281 --> 00:12:44,801
In order to move forward, we require
you to sign the Official Secrets Act.

160
00:12:48,921 --> 00:12:49,921
Thank you.

161
00:12:50,841 --> 00:12:53,761
I trust the idiot boy is still
in the dark about all of this?

162
00:12:53,801 --> 00:12:55,481
He's not an idiot.

163
00:12:55,521 --> 00:12:57,521
He doesn't know what
you're doing though, does he?

164
00:12:57,561 --> 00:12:58,641
No.

165
00:12:58,681 --> 00:12:59,681
Good.

166
00:13:00,441 --> 00:13:01,441
The fewer the better.

167
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:07,241
You only need to read that the penalty for even
the slightest deviation from secrecy is...

168
00:13:07,281 --> 00:13:10,281
'To be hanged by the neck
until life is extinct'.

169
00:13:10,321 --> 00:13:11,321
Indeed.

170
00:13:24,841 --> 00:13:26,881
Rather a nice pen.

171
00:13:26,921 --> 00:13:28,521
Keep it.

172
00:13:28,561 --> 00:13:29,561
Please.

173
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:43,841
Someone's cheery!

174
00:13:46,641 --> 00:13:48,161
Why, thank you!

175
00:13:49,321 --> 00:13:50,801
I take it you had a good day?

176
00:13:50,841 --> 00:13:54,601
An excellent day, Mag,
a thoroughly excellent day!

177
00:13:54,641 --> 00:13:56,281
I just need to finish this.

178
00:13:56,321 --> 00:13:58,401
I've been struggling with this
for quite some time.

179
00:13:58,441 --> 00:14:01,521
Could you hold this
while I fasten this clip?

180
00:14:01,561 --> 00:14:05,121
Can you hold this piece here?

181
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:08,241
Got it... Ok.

182
00:14:11,441 --> 00:14:12,561
You genius!

183
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,681
Well, here's hoping.

184
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:15,721
SQ?

185
00:14:16,281 --> 00:14:18,521
Tell me all about your excellent day.

186
00:14:18,561 --> 00:14:21,521
You've barely uttered a word
about your work lately.

187
00:14:23,001 --> 00:14:24,481
I'm sorry... I can't.

188
00:14:26,321 --> 00:14:27,681
It's a secret.

189
00:14:27,721 --> 00:14:29,081
A secret?

190
00:14:29,601 --> 00:14:30,801
You're a weatherman!

191
00:14:30,841 --> 00:14:31,881
Not just a weatherman.

192
00:14:31,921 --> 00:14:34,281
Oh no, no... You fix broach clips too.

193
00:14:34,321 --> 00:14:36,241
And bicycle chains.

194
00:14:36,281 --> 00:14:37,961
The list is endless!

195
00:14:38,001 --> 00:14:41,761
So, pray do tell, what's so secret?

196
00:14:42,401 --> 00:14:45,441
Are we going to have a hot summer?
Should we panic-buy sun hats and the like?

197
00:14:48,361 --> 00:14:50,161
I'm working for the Air Ministry.

198
00:14:53,081 --> 00:14:54,441
No, I am.

199
00:14:55,001 --> 00:14:56,921
No. I'm not joking, stop.

200
00:14:57,401 --> 00:15:00,921
There's a threat
and I've been asked to help.

201
00:15:00,961 --> 00:15:03,921
The Government have asked you?

202
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:05,881
Really?

203
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:12,841
- You're serious?
- Quite serious.

204
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,401
What exactly is this 'threat'?

205
00:15:18,601 --> 00:15:20,561
I'm not allowed to say.

206
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:23,401
I'm sorry, Mag.

207
00:15:28,001 --> 00:15:29,321
I'm sorry.

208
00:15:55,361 --> 00:15:56,721
Good morning.

209
00:15:57,441 --> 00:15:58,921
Morning, Professor.

210
00:15:58,961 --> 00:16:01,001
You seem... jolly?

211
00:16:01,441 --> 00:16:04,161
Perhaps I too should
whistle a happy tune?

212
00:16:04,201 --> 00:16:06,921
After all, we have
nothing to worry about.

213
00:16:06,961 --> 00:16:09,281
Aside from Hitler announcing conscription,

214
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:12,201
secretly practising war manoeuvres
and building aeroplanes.

215
00:16:12,241 --> 00:16:14,401
Or perhaps the lightness of your mood

216
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:17,121
is related to some success
by your little committee?

217
00:16:17,161 --> 00:16:18,721
We're... making progress.

218
00:16:18,761 --> 00:16:19,841
With the death ray?

219
00:16:19,881 --> 00:16:23,601
The system we're developing
may help us build a defence that...

220
00:16:23,641 --> 00:16:25,681
Hitler will crush.

221
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:31,361
Yes, you're right,
you're absolutely right.

222
00:16:32,001 --> 00:16:33,561
Good clay, Professor.

223
00:16:40,441 --> 00:16:42,521
Certainly not, Professor.

224
00:16:42,561 --> 00:16:43,681
Ooh.

225
00:16:43,721 --> 00:16:47,041
Well, in that case it's a direct order.

226
00:16:48,401 --> 00:16:51,401
Tell me who Tizard's committee have met.

227
00:16:51,441 --> 00:16:52,961
That's classified.

228
00:16:53,001 --> 00:16:54,161
Oh.

229
00:16:58,641 --> 00:17:01,921
I am sorry. I apologise for my manner.

230
00:17:02,361 --> 00:17:05,361
We're all working in
very difficult circumstances.

231
00:17:06,961 --> 00:17:08,561
I feel...

232
00:17:08,601 --> 00:17:11,121
May I trouble you for a glass of water?

233
00:17:11,761 --> 00:17:13,721
Won't be a moment.

234
00:17:41,681 --> 00:17:43,481
I am afraid our hands are tied.

235
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:44,961
How so?

236
00:17:45,521 --> 00:17:47,441
The secret nature of the project

237
00:17:47,481 --> 00:17:50,721
does prevent us from taking out
an advertisement in the Times.

238
00:17:50,761 --> 00:17:56,321
Well you better tell Mr Tizard
that we're going to need more time.

239
00:17:56,961 --> 00:17:59,081
There's only two of us here.

240
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:00,641
Close the door.

241
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:04,681
You detected a plane
a few hundred yards away in a field.

242
00:18:04,721 --> 00:18:07,161
That won't protect Britain.

243
00:18:10,681 --> 00:18:12,681
You need to think bigger.

244
00:18:13,161 --> 00:18:15,881
I'm going to make some calls
to Oxford and Cambridge,

245
00:18:15,921 --> 00:18:18,081
see who we can drum up.

246
00:18:18,121 --> 00:18:20,081
No, I'd like to use men
from the weather lab.

247
00:18:21,641 --> 00:18:23,361
My dear man, if we want this to work

248
00:18:23,401 --> 00:18:26,041
we will require the very best
physicists and mathematicians

249
00:18:26,081 --> 00:18:28,561
and we find those gentlemen
not at the weather lab

250
00:18:28,601 --> 00:18:30,401
but at our oldest universities.

251
00:18:30,441 --> 00:18:31,841
You don't think
Weathermen are good enough

252
00:18:31,881 --> 00:18:34,321
because they don't wear
the right tie and all that?

253
00:18:34,361 --> 00:18:36,841
Some of your lot don't
wear ties at all, do they?

254
00:18:38,361 --> 00:18:40,241
Look, your little Weathermen friends
are all well and good

255
00:18:40,281 --> 00:18:42,321
and I'm sure they're perfectly harmless

256
00:18:42,361 --> 00:18:45,841
but they simply do not have the expertise
with this particular technology

257
00:18:45,881 --> 00:18:47,441
our best professors do.

258
00:18:47,801 --> 00:18:49,801
They also do what they're told.

259
00:18:49,841 --> 00:18:51,161
Really?

260
00:18:52,721 --> 00:18:55,681
Cavendish... Shall we?

261
00:19:01,121 --> 00:19:04,521
Yes, er, Cambridge 2443, please.

262
00:19:04,561 --> 00:19:07,441
The Cavendish Laboratory,
Cambridge University.

263
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:10,681
They'll do what they're told?

264
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:15,881
Is that Sir James Thomson?

265
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:19,081
Yes. Sorry to bother you, sir,
I'm calling from the Post Office.

266
00:19:19,121 --> 00:19:20,961
Just a wee check on the line.

267
00:19:21,001 --> 00:19:24,721
Do you happen to have a container
of water near to your telephone?

268
00:19:24,761 --> 00:19:27,401
A sink perhaps?
Or maybe a bucket.

269
00:19:27,441 --> 00:19:30,081
A fish tank! Yes, that will suffice.

270
00:19:30,121 --> 00:19:33,361
Now, could you please
pop your telephone into it?

271
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:36,321
Yes, into the fish tank...

272
00:19:36,361 --> 00:19:40,961
It's the only way we can fully ensure that your
equipment is compatible with the new system.

273
00:19:41,801 --> 00:19:44,361
That's excellent, sir.

274
00:19:48,281 --> 00:19:50,161
PHONE LINE HISSES

275
00:19:52,321 --> 00:19:54,721
But most folk call me Taffy.

276
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:57,721
I don't know why.
Swansea's miles away from the River Taff.

277
00:19:57,761 --> 00:19:59,841
I was born in Cockett, you see.

278
00:20:01,681 --> 00:20:03,321
Perhaps as well they call me Taffy, eh?

279
00:20:06,321 --> 00:20:09,401
I graduated from Swansea University
with first class Honours

280
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:13,081
erm, MSc the year after that and
completed my doctorate at King's College

281
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:16,001
and I've been at the station
in Slough ever since.

282
00:20:17,521 --> 00:20:20,441
So you're an untried PhD student?

283
00:20:21,121 --> 00:20:22,641
Can I ask you

284
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:24,761
will I be working for you or for him?

285
00:20:24,801 --> 00:20:25,801
Oh, him.

286
00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:27,881
In that case

287
00:20:27,921 --> 00:20:32,281
thanks for the tie, Rob.
And er... I will take the post. Thanks.

288
00:20:33,121 --> 00:20:34,961
Welcome to the team.

289
00:20:37,241 --> 00:20:39,321
Are you sure these men
are the right ones for the job?

290
00:20:39,361 --> 00:20:41,041
I'm positive.

291
00:20:41,081 --> 00:20:46,361
We need free-thinkers,
rule breakers, men without ties.

292
00:20:47,961 --> 00:20:51,081
These men will strive
to make this thing work.

293
00:20:51,121 --> 00:20:52,281
KNOCKS

294
00:20:52,321 --> 00:20:55,081
Higgy. Very pleased
you are going to join us.

295
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:57,641
Sorry, I knocked but, erm...
That's alright, come on in.

296
00:20:57,681 --> 00:20:59,801
I'll pop back later,
if you still want me?

297
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,881
Mr Tizard is on his way over.

298
00:21:01,921 --> 00:21:05,361
Since you won't listen to me, perhaps
you could discuss your 'team' with him?

299
00:21:07,481 --> 00:21:09,161
Sorry, sir. Sorry.

300
00:21:15,881 --> 00:21:20,761
I don't want to be fobbed off with a bunch
of Oxford academics I've never even met.

301
00:21:20,801 --> 00:21:24,241
These are all people I've
worked with before, I trust them.

302
00:21:24,281 --> 00:21:26,961
It's your team, I'm happy
for you to choose who you want.

303
00:21:28,481 --> 00:21:30,121
Thank you.

304
00:21:52,121 --> 00:21:56,041
Our intelligence says that
Hitler has built three thousand planes.

305
00:21:56,721 --> 00:21:58,401
Passenger planes?

306
00:21:58,441 --> 00:21:59,881
Two-seaters.

307
00:21:59,921 --> 00:22:04,321
By the time the world wakes up to the noise
that's building in Germany it will be too late.

308
00:22:05,441 --> 00:22:09,801
Your theories, experiments, tests,
are all well and good Robert

309
00:22:09,841 --> 00:22:13,161
but you need to understand
that, very soon

310
00:22:13,201 --> 00:22:16,121
German planes may well be
dropping bombs onto our homes.

311
00:22:17,681 --> 00:22:20,721
There are others in the Ministry
who want to channel all our efforts

312
00:22:20,761 --> 00:22:23,481
into striking Germany hard and fast.

313
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,441
There's opposition to what we're doing?

314
00:22:26,481 --> 00:22:31,041
I've managed to get you a little funding
and a base to test and experiment.

315
00:22:31,081 --> 00:22:36,481
I'm backing you every step of the way but
we don't yet know if this thing will work.

316
00:22:37,401 --> 00:22:38,721
It Will.

317
00:22:38,761 --> 00:22:40,561
It has to, Robert.

318
00:22:41,841 --> 00:22:43,281
It has to.

319
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:02,001
Are you alright Uncle Robert?

320
00:23:03,241 --> 00:23:06,001
What? Er, yes. Sorry.

321
00:23:07,961 --> 00:23:10,041
I just fell asleep with my eyes open!

322
00:23:10,081 --> 00:23:11,841
It's time I took you home.

323
00:23:11,881 --> 00:23:13,321
I'll get my stuff.

324
00:23:15,201 --> 00:23:16,801
You look tired.

325
00:23:19,881 --> 00:23:21,961
I've got to go away for a while.

326
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:23,241
Work.

327
00:23:24,161 --> 00:23:26,041
The secret thing?

328
00:23:27,561 --> 00:23:29,561
You'll be away from home.

329
00:23:29,601 --> 00:23:31,721
- For how long?
- I don't know.

330
00:23:32,241 --> 00:23:35,281
As long as it takes me
to mess it up and get fired, I expect.

331
00:23:35,321 --> 00:23:37,481
I'm sure that won't happen.

332
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,441
I'm not.

333
00:23:39,801 --> 00:23:41,561
Is there anything I can do to help?

334
00:23:41,601 --> 00:23:43,361
I don't think so.

335
00:23:44,481 --> 00:23:45,841
You could visit.

336
00:23:46,241 --> 00:23:50,361
Not at work of course,
but we could sneak away to a wee hotel.

337
00:23:50,401 --> 00:23:52,201
We can be together,
every other weekend or so.

338
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:58,961
I'm your wife, this is our home.

339
00:23:59,001 --> 00:24:01,641
You finish work at
the same time every day

340
00:24:01,681 --> 00:24:05,441
you come home, we have dinner,
we listen to the wireless, we go to bed.

341
00:24:05,481 --> 00:24:07,321
That's what we do,
that's who we are.

342
00:24:07,361 --> 00:24:12,921
You are not a secret Government employee
and I am not some girl who visits hotels.

343
00:24:16,641 --> 00:24:21,081
We'll be together, here,
when you finish your work.

344
00:24:22,681 --> 00:24:23,841
Ok.

345
00:24:42,201 --> 00:24:43,721
Professor?

346
00:24:44,241 --> 00:24:46,081
You're in my office.

347
00:24:46,121 --> 00:24:49,881
Tell me what Tizard and
this weatherman are up to.

348
00:24:50,441 --> 00:24:52,121
Tell me.
They're researching a project.

349
00:24:52,161 --> 00:24:54,401
That much I know.
These are my private papers.

350
00:24:54,441 --> 00:24:56,441
What exactly is the project?

351
00:24:57,001 --> 00:24:59,161
Rowe! What is the project?

352
00:25:00,961 --> 00:25:03,841
It's weather related hocus-pocus.
All very dull.

353
00:25:03,881 --> 00:25:06,441
Are your loyalties with me
or with Henry Tizard?

354
00:25:06,961 --> 00:25:09,601
Are we not all on
the same side, Professor?

355
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,041
Hmm.

356
00:25:19,761 --> 00:25:23,041
SINGING Oh, I do like to walk
along the prom prom prom

357
00:25:23,081 --> 00:25:26,801
where the brass band play
tiddly-om-pom-pom.

358
00:25:26,841 --> 00:25:30,721
Oh, I do like to be beside the seaside

359
00:25:30,761 --> 00:25:34,401
I'll be beside myself with glee

360
00:25:34,441 --> 00:25:38,561
and there's lots of girls beside
that I'd like to be besides

361
00:25:38,601 --> 00:25:41,801
beside the seaside, beside the sea.

362
00:25:47,361 --> 00:25:49,241
This can't be it.

363
00:25:49,561 --> 00:25:51,241
I've stayed in worse.

364
00:25:51,281 --> 00:25:52,761
I've lived in worse.

365
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,721
No. This can't be it.

366
00:26:27,241 --> 00:26:29,241
Alright, lads, are we all ready?

367
00:26:29,281 --> 00:26:30,881
- Oh, come on!
- Gently.

368
00:26:31,561 --> 00:26:34,121
We've got to get the pulses strong enough
to detect further away.

369
00:26:34,441 --> 00:26:36,241
We need more power.

370
00:26:36,841 --> 00:26:40,041
We need our pulses to go further.
Pass us that, will you?

371
00:26:40,081 --> 00:26:41,201
Equalise the power.

372
00:26:44,521 --> 00:26:46,201
Keep your fingers crossed.

373
00:27:43,521 --> 00:27:45,361
We're picking something up.

374
00:27:45,401 --> 00:27:47,081
Our new transmitter is working!

375
00:27:47,121 --> 00:27:48,521
I wouldn't call it new.

376
00:27:48,561 --> 00:27:50,801
Our 'cobbled together
with bits of string' transmitter.

377
00:27:50,841 --> 00:27:51,961
But it works!

378
00:27:52,001 --> 00:27:53,161
Barely.

379
00:27:54,281 --> 00:27:56,721
And we're detecting
a plane out there, right?

380
00:27:56,761 --> 00:27:58,401
Estimated at a mile away.

381
00:27:58,441 --> 00:28:00,561
A mile away, Mr Rowe!

382
00:28:00,601 --> 00:28:02,601
I assume you know
this is not good enough?

383
00:28:03,721 --> 00:28:06,441
Yes, it works, well done.

384
00:28:06,961 --> 00:28:11,441
Now, let's pretend you've
located an enemy bomber.

385
00:28:12,161 --> 00:28:13,401
One. Two.

386
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:14,601
One. Two.

387
00:28:14,641 --> 00:28:17,881
And let's also pretend
it's headed in our direction.

388
00:28:19,041 --> 00:28:23,881
A modern bomber flying at two hundred miles an
hour would cover the distance of a mile in...

389
00:28:23,921 --> 00:28:26,761
what... twenty seconds?

390
00:28:28,601 --> 00:28:31,521
You really think that is enough time
to pass on the information

391
00:28:31,561 --> 00:28:33,361
and get our pilots airborne?

392
00:28:33,401 --> 00:28:36,481
Nineteen. Twenty.

393
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:41,081
Exactly.

394
00:29:03,681 --> 00:29:05,161
Mags!

395
00:29:05,841 --> 00:29:08,281
I caught the train,
thought I'd surprise you.

396
00:29:10,481 --> 00:29:12,001
How nice.

397
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:19,401
I struggled to find a little music on the
wireless with all the talk of Germany...

398
00:29:20,081 --> 00:29:21,521
Yes.

399
00:29:22,521 --> 00:29:25,201
It's a nice little place, isn't it?

400
00:29:26,441 --> 00:29:27,481
The hotel.

401
00:29:28,481 --> 00:29:30,081
Yes, it is.

402
00:29:32,441 --> 00:29:34,521
Can you help me with this?

403
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:36,121
Right...

404
00:29:43,001 --> 00:29:46,441
Your nephew's called round almost
every clay hoping you'd be back.

405
00:29:46,481 --> 00:29:48,521
He's really missing you.

406
00:29:48,561 --> 00:29:50,001
As am I.

407
00:29:51,361 --> 00:29:53,201
S'why I had to come here.

408
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:55,721
To see you.

409
00:30:00,561 --> 00:30:02,481
To be with you.

410
00:30:04,161 --> 00:30:05,961
That's got it.

411
00:30:10,001 --> 00:30:15,921
I'll just pop this away and then
we can spend some time together...

412
00:30:16,961 --> 00:30:19,681
Yes, erm...

413
00:30:20,361 --> 00:30:22,001
After I have done this...

414
00:30:23,361 --> 00:30:28,361
Look, why don't you go downstairs
and order a spot of dinner...

415
00:30:28,401 --> 00:30:29,841
What about you?

416
00:30:29,881 --> 00:30:31,401
You can order for me.

417
00:30:31,441 --> 00:30:32,881
You know what I like.

418
00:30:32,921 --> 00:30:35,801
And, er... I'll be with you
the moment I've finished.

419
00:30:37,281 --> 00:30:40,121
- And then...
- Yes.

420
00:31:37,601 --> 00:31:40,001
They're sending some supper up for you.

421
00:31:40,041 --> 00:31:42,361
Oh, sorry.

422
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:44,721
So am I.

423
00:31:51,921 --> 00:31:54,081
This is the future.

424
00:31:54,121 --> 00:31:56,881
Soup warmed with a
high-powered transmitter.

425
00:31:56,921 --> 00:31:59,121
Can I have your attention, please?

426
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:02,241
Sorry, sir!

427
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:10,441
Now, we have shown we can detect a plane
when it is flying right overhead.

428
00:32:10,481 --> 00:32:12,961
But we need to go much further.

429
00:32:13,001 --> 00:32:15,121
How do we do this?

430
00:32:15,161 --> 00:32:19,521
It's obvious we have to go
back to the drawing board...

431
00:32:21,361 --> 00:32:27,121
This is the drawing board...
The first obstacle will be power.

432
00:32:28,001 --> 00:32:30,761
We need more power
to transmit our pulses.

433
00:32:30,801 --> 00:32:33,241
And more power allows us
to reach a higher frequency

434
00:32:33,281 --> 00:32:35,361
higher frequency improves accuracy.

435
00:32:35,401 --> 00:32:37,001
To increase frequency
and get the range we need

436
00:32:37,041 --> 00:32:38,841
we need to increase power.

437
00:32:38,881 --> 00:32:41,321
It's like inventing a chicken
and an egg at the same time.

438
00:32:41,361 --> 00:32:45,801
But if we solve one the other will fall into
place! So concentrate on cracking power.

439
00:32:45,841 --> 00:32:47,441
We'll need better valves.
We haven't got better valves.

440
00:32:47,481 --> 00:32:50,321
But the ones we got aren't up to it,
they keep blowing.

441
00:32:50,361 --> 00:32:52,201
You don't have to put
your hand up, Higgy. You just...

442
00:32:52,241 --> 00:32:55,841
Sorry. The equipment,
if you don't mind me saying, sir...

443
00:32:55,881 --> 00:32:58,761
it's stuff left over from the Stone Age. I
think we're going to struggle, that's all.

444
00:32:58,801 --> 00:33:02,321
We should have been in the navy.
They're awash with cash, that lot.

445
00:33:02,361 --> 00:33:04,241
Boatloads of equipment
that they'll never use!

446
00:33:04,281 --> 00:33:06,601
Well, I'm sorry we haven't got
the funding we need

447
00:33:06,641 --> 00:33:09,521
but if we show that this can work
then that will change.

448
00:33:09,561 --> 00:33:11,441
We can't show that it'll work
without the better equipment.

449
00:33:11,481 --> 00:33:12,481
Chicken and egg.

450
00:33:12,521 --> 00:33:13,881
We have to be canny and clever.

451
00:33:13,921 --> 00:33:16,841
It's up to us to prove that this can work.
No one else can.

452
00:33:16,881 --> 00:33:18,041
So, I've got faith in you.

453
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:21,001
And if we work together,
as a team, we will do this!

454
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:25,761
Crack power and let's make
the invisible viisible.

455
00:33:38,601 --> 00:33:40,561
I've got a bad feeling about this.

456
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:42,201
Couldn't we have just
asked them for the equipment?

457
00:33:42,241 --> 00:33:43,401
Oh, yes...

458
00:33:43,441 --> 00:33:46,481
Excuse me, we hear you have some much larger
valves in your stores than we've got.

459
00:33:46,521 --> 00:33:47,801
Please could we have some?

460
00:33:47,841 --> 00:33:50,441
We'd have to fill requests in triplicate,
have them signed, countersigned...

461
00:33:50,481 --> 00:33:51,921
We'd all be dead by the time
they approved it.

462
00:33:51,961 --> 00:33:53,321
If they approved it.

463
00:33:53,361 --> 00:33:55,001
Why have I got to do all the talking?

464
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:57,081
Nobody would believe a Welshy!
Or a Yorkie.

465
00:33:57,121 --> 00:33:59,441
Yorkshire men are reliable,
unlike the Welsh.

466
00:33:59,481 --> 00:34:01,841
Ridiculous.
We pronounce it 'ridiculous'.

467
00:34:01,881 --> 00:34:03,441
I'm gonna belt you after this.

468
00:34:05,401 --> 00:34:06,921
- Evening.
- Pass.

469
00:34:08,801 --> 00:34:13,361
The ministry have contacted you four times
in the last week without acknowledgement...

470
00:34:13,401 --> 00:34:15,321
We don't need a pass.
No, what we need...

471
00:34:15,361 --> 00:34:17,081
No entry without a pass.

472
00:34:17,121 --> 00:34:18,961
FAUX POSH We're here under
direct orders from the Ministry

473
00:34:19,001 --> 00:34:21,681
to find listening equipment
planted by the German agents.

474
00:34:32,921 --> 00:34:36,841
Stand in our way and I'll have you
arrested for treason, understood?

475
00:34:41,841 --> 00:34:43,041
Thank you.

476
00:34:50,561 --> 00:34:51,841
What's the paperwork?

477
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:54,001
Just some old radio
transmitter technical plans.

478
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:55,041
Oh.

479
00:35:03,001 --> 00:35:04,601
This stuff is amazing!

480
00:35:04,641 --> 00:35:07,241
We're not out of the woods yet.

481
00:35:15,121 --> 00:35:16,961
Er, this paperwork...

482
00:35:17,001 --> 00:35:18,401
- Ah, yes... Thank you.
- Err...

483
00:35:18,441 --> 00:35:22,161
Ssh... Don't! Just don't!

484
00:35:26,081 --> 00:35:27,081
Ok?

485
00:35:27,561 --> 00:35:29,001
I think so.

486
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:30,361
Fingers crossed.

487
00:35:37,281 --> 00:35:38,641
It's working!

488
00:35:38,681 --> 00:35:39,761
What is?

489
00:35:39,801 --> 00:35:41,201
Better valves. More power.

490
00:35:41,241 --> 00:35:42,841
- New valves.
- New valves?

491
00:35:42,881 --> 00:35:45,401
Aye, new valves
that arrived this morning.

492
00:35:45,441 --> 00:35:46,561
From where?

493
00:35:46,601 --> 00:35:49,721
From friends... in the navy.

494
00:35:50,921 --> 00:35:52,481
The navy sent us these?

495
00:35:52,521 --> 00:35:54,441
Well, they didn't really 'send' them.

496
00:35:55,001 --> 00:35:56,041
No...

497
00:35:57,081 --> 00:35:58,881
We had to pick them up.

498
00:36:01,121 --> 00:36:03,481
Hey! We're building up to
350 kilowatts of peak power!

499
00:36:03,521 --> 00:36:05,281
I wouldn't celebrate just yet.

500
00:36:05,321 --> 00:36:08,082
Even with more efficient valves,
we're not getting the power output...

501
00:36:13,121 --> 00:36:15,161
Have you not got it yet?

502
00:36:16,921 --> 00:36:18,721
Have you not realised
what's at stake here?

503
00:36:18,761 --> 00:36:21,321
Tizard and the committee
are coming at the end of the week

504
00:36:21,361 --> 00:36:22,721
and we have to show progress...

505
00:36:22,761 --> 00:36:25,161
Hey... We're flogging our guts out here.

506
00:36:25,201 --> 00:36:27,881
It looks like it!
All day, everyday.

507
00:36:27,921 --> 00:36:29,721
On something that'll
probably never work anyway!

508
00:36:29,761 --> 00:36:32,761
If that's what you think,
you may as well go.

509
00:36:32,801 --> 00:36:36,161
I mean it - go. Go on!
That applies to all of you!

510
00:36:47,801 --> 00:36:49,041
Robert!

511
00:36:49,721 --> 00:36:51,761
Robert Watson-Watt!

512
00:36:51,801 --> 00:36:54,361
You're happy to talk aren't you,
but not as happy to listen!

513
00:36:54,401 --> 00:36:56,681
That bunch of men back there
are working til they drop.

514
00:36:56,721 --> 00:36:57,761
- D'you...
- No!

515
00:36:57,801 --> 00:37:00,361
You don't get to speak here,
you've done enough talking - you listen!

516
00:37:00,401 --> 00:37:04,441
You said we were working together
and we are - you're not!

517
00:37:04,481 --> 00:37:07,641
We are, we're not 'your' team,
you're part of it!

518
00:37:07,681 --> 00:37:10,001
And it's high time you rolled up
your sleeves and mucked in, instead of...

519
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:11,041
You think I'm not working?

520
00:37:11,081 --> 00:37:13,881
You think I'm not rolling up my sleeves
and getting to work. I am!

521
00:37:13,921 --> 00:37:15,361
Yeah, from upstairs maybe.

522
00:37:15,401 --> 00:37:17,081
Behind closed doors,
away from the shop floor!

523
00:37:17,121 --> 00:37:18,681
I'm dealing with everything else!

524
00:37:18,721 --> 00:37:20,321
The ministry, Tizard, Rowe...

525
00:37:20,361 --> 00:37:24,641
All this strife, they're trying to get me to
magic a giant rabbit out of a tiny wee hat!

526
00:37:24,681 --> 00:37:27,321
They are going to come down here,
the ministry, and ask what is going on

527
00:37:27,361 --> 00:37:29,121
and what progress we're making.
I am going mad with it

528
00:37:29,161 --> 00:37:30,761
and I can't tell Margaret or anyone

529
00:37:30,801 --> 00:37:33,401
because I am supposed to be in charge
and know what I'm doing!

530
00:37:33,441 --> 00:37:37,841
Talk to me. Talk to me, Rob.
Look, we are all in the same boat.

531
00:37:39,041 --> 00:37:42,401
You can't do this on your own,
you're part of a team.

532
00:37:42,441 --> 00:37:43,921
Our team.

533
00:38:06,441 --> 00:38:11,601
I'd like... to apologise to you,

534
00:38:13,321 --> 00:38:15,161
to everybody.

535
00:38:16,001 --> 00:38:18,881
And... I'm sorry.

536
00:38:47,321 --> 00:38:48,641
Taff?

537
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,441
What is that game called?

538
00:38:54,281 --> 00:38:55,881
Yes!

539
00:38:55,921 --> 00:38:57,361
Catch it!

540
00:38:58,641 --> 00:39:01,321
Jesus! He couldn't
catch a cold, that one.

541
00:39:02,681 --> 00:39:04,001
Here y'are, Rob!

542
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:06,241
SINGING
Feed me now and ever more!

543
00:39:11,681 --> 00:39:13,281
You trying to take my head off?
If I wanted to I would have done!

544
00:39:13,321 --> 00:39:14,601
Oh yeah?

545
00:39:15,361 --> 00:39:16,361
Yeah.

546
00:39:18,681 --> 00:39:20,521
Howzat!

547
00:39:20,561 --> 00:39:21,641
No. No.

548
00:39:22,601 --> 00:39:24,081
Come on, Taffy! Back to the Valleys!

549
00:39:24,121 --> 00:39:25,961
SINGING Heigh-Ho!

550
00:39:26,001 --> 00:39:27,401
Come on!

551
00:39:27,441 --> 00:39:28,801
I'm going to bloody kill you!

552
00:39:29,321 --> 00:39:31,641
I'm going to bloody kill you!

553
00:39:31,681 --> 00:39:34,001
Lads! Lads!

554
00:39:34,041 --> 00:39:36,041
Taff... Calm down.

555
00:39:38,561 --> 00:39:40,121
Where are you gonna go?

556
00:39:41,201 --> 00:39:42,961
We should start a sweep.

557
00:39:45,401 --> 00:39:46,401
Come on!

558
00:39:49,641 --> 00:39:51,201
Pace yourself, Taff!

559
00:39:54,281 --> 00:39:56,201
Are you alright there, Taff?

560
00:39:59,121 --> 00:40:00,561
What's he doing?

561
00:40:02,361 --> 00:40:03,521
Taff!

562
00:40:03,561 --> 00:40:04,881
Bell!

563
00:40:06,961 --> 00:40:08,241
Bell!

564
00:40:10,761 --> 00:40:14,161
Our transmitter's five
thousand volts, yeah?

565
00:40:14,201 --> 00:40:17,361
It produces 350kw of peak power.

566
00:40:17,401 --> 00:40:18,641
Aye.

567
00:40:18,681 --> 00:40:20,241
I have never understood cricket.

568
00:40:20,281 --> 00:40:22,321
We can't exceed that.
Blows the valves.

569
00:40:22,361 --> 00:40:24,641
Cos its constantly running.
It's in constant use!

570
00:40:24,681 --> 00:40:28,081
But... if we do quick bursts

571
00:40:28,121 --> 00:40:31,161
- like sprinting...
- Recover.

572
00:40:31,201 --> 00:40:32,841
- Sprint...
- Recover.

573
00:40:32,881 --> 00:40:35,121
The valves have time to recover...
Don't they?

574
00:40:36,961 --> 00:40:39,401
Aye... Yes!

575
00:40:43,761 --> 00:40:45,561
Let's get to it!

576
00:40:59,441 --> 00:41:02,441
The PM will never spend
enough to catch up.

577
00:41:02,481 --> 00:41:05,481
We have to invest all our resources
in building a death ray

578
00:41:05,521 --> 00:41:07,321
and take the fight to them.

579
00:41:07,361 --> 00:41:12,641
That's not going to happen while Tizard's
radio-locator is being considered.

580
00:41:13,081 --> 00:41:16,561
We may be able to push
for our own defence committee.

581
00:41:16,601 --> 00:41:18,281
Above Tizard?

582
00:41:18,761 --> 00:41:20,641
Naturally.

583
00:41:20,681 --> 00:41:23,081
Will Baldwin listen to you?

584
00:41:23,361 --> 00:41:24,921
He will.

585
00:41:25,361 --> 00:41:26,961
He certainly will

586
00:41:27,001 --> 00:41:32,561
when you tell him what Tizard's merry
band of Weathermen are actually doing.

587
00:41:32,601 --> 00:41:36,721
I have a man on the inside, Winston.
One of the weatherman's team.

588
00:41:36,761 --> 00:41:38,441
A saboteur?

589
00:41:38,481 --> 00:41:43,481
No, he simply reports back
what developments they have made.

590
00:41:43,521 --> 00:41:44,681
And?

591
00:41:44,721 --> 00:41:46,761
Precious few, Winston.

592
00:41:50,961 --> 00:41:53,041
I'll call Baldwin.

593
00:41:55,041 --> 00:41:57,401
And you keep talking to your mole.

594
00:42:01,161 --> 00:42:03,161
Aargh! Bell's secret recipe.

595
00:42:03,881 --> 00:42:07,441
I call it Problem Solver.
It sparks the mind, you see.

596
00:42:07,481 --> 00:42:09,081
Ooh, it is strong, that!

597
00:42:09,121 --> 00:42:11,121
It's got to be strong,
to keep the chill off.

598
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:13,881
You could just wear
normal clothes like me.

599
00:42:19,361 --> 00:42:20,761
Take it off him.

600
00:42:28,241 --> 00:42:29,641
No more for you!

601
00:42:29,681 --> 00:42:31,041
Mr Rowe?

602
00:42:31,081 --> 00:42:33,081
SINGING Row row row your boat...

603
00:42:33,121 --> 00:42:33,761
Ssh!

604
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:36,081
SINGING Gently down the stream!
- Ssh!

605
00:42:36,121 --> 00:42:38,641
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily...

606
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:41,961
Mr Rowe, what are you doing here?
life is but a dream.

607
00:42:42,001 --> 00:42:45,721
I've been sent to ensure that everything
will be in place for the demonstration.

608
00:42:45,761 --> 00:42:47,881
What, may I ask, are you celebrating?

609
00:42:47,921 --> 00:42:51,401
Life!
Er, progress Mr Rowe, progress!

610
00:42:51,441 --> 00:42:53,281
You've built the thing and it works?

611
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:55,001
Er, not exactly...

612
00:42:55,041 --> 00:42:56,521
But we're well on our way.

613
00:42:56,561 --> 00:42:58,201
- Oh yes!
- Any minute now!

614
00:42:58,241 --> 00:43:02,681
And the power.
We've, erm, solved the power.

615
00:43:02,721 --> 00:43:05,721
Although we've still got
range to deal with.

616
00:43:07,881 --> 00:43:10,641
So there's no improvement in
how far you can send your pulses?

617
00:43:11,681 --> 00:43:13,561
There's quite a large team
coming up from Whitehall

618
00:43:13,601 --> 00:43:16,841
who need convincing of the
worthiness of the radio locator.

619
00:43:16,881 --> 00:43:19,641
If they don't have proof it works
they will pull the plug.

620
00:43:19,681 --> 00:43:22,801
I think we should call it a night.

621
00:43:22,841 --> 00:43:24,721
- Agreed.
- Gentlemen, good night.

622
00:43:25,681 --> 00:43:27,601
- Taff!
- Come on, big boy.

623
00:43:31,481 --> 00:43:33,881
You cannot let this Whitehall...
Here you go Rob.

624
00:43:33,921 --> 00:43:35,881
I don't want it.

625
00:43:37,761 --> 00:43:42,081
You cannot allow the Whitehall lot
to see this backstage nonsense

626
00:43:42,121 --> 00:43:45,601
the strings, the smoke and mirrors.

627
00:43:45,641 --> 00:43:48,841
They need to be dazzled with magic.

628
00:43:49,401 --> 00:43:50,561
Right.

629
00:44:39,721 --> 00:44:41,641
PHONE RINGS

630
00:44:45,361 --> 00:44:46,201
Yes?

631
00:44:46,241 --> 00:44:47,681
Robert. It's me.

632
00:44:48,481 --> 00:44:49,201
What?

633
00:44:49,241 --> 00:44:51,081
Oh... are you in
the middle of something?

634
00:44:51,561 --> 00:44:54,201
Yes, erm... Is everything alright?

635
00:44:54,241 --> 00:44:58,001
Yes, sorry. I won't keep you, I just
wanted to talk to you about the weekend.

636
00:44:58,041 --> 00:44:59,361
The weekend?

637
00:45:00,001 --> 00:45:02,881
You are still planning on
coming home? Aren't you?

638
00:45:03,521 --> 00:45:05,081
I'm sorry, Mag. I can't.

639
00:45:06,001 --> 00:45:07,761
Oh well...

640
00:45:08,121 --> 00:45:09,961
Would you like me
to come to the hotel?

641
00:45:10,561 --> 00:45:12,561
Look, I'm really tied up with work...

642
00:45:12,601 --> 00:45:14,641
I don't think it's... erm...

643
00:45:14,681 --> 00:45:16,521
I have got some very
important people coming down

644
00:45:16,561 --> 00:45:18,841
to see a demonstration
of something I cannot do.

645
00:45:19,641 --> 00:45:21,761
What should I do, Mags?

646
00:45:23,481 --> 00:45:25,361
Look to the sky.

647
00:45:25,401 --> 00:45:28,321
Isn't that what you always do,
when you're struggling...

648
00:45:28,361 --> 00:45:30,481
Look to the sky, Robert.

649
00:45:31,041 --> 00:45:32,641
I'd better go.

650
00:45:32,681 --> 00:45:34,041
Yes...

651
00:45:35,521 --> 00:45:36,881
Goodbye.

652
00:45:38,321 --> 00:45:39,561
Bye.

653
00:45:42,121 --> 00:45:44,001
I love you.

654
00:47:04,961 --> 00:47:06,201
The ionosphere?

655
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:10,121
It's a layer of the earth's atmosphere -
a band of charged electrons, and...

656
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:12,121
- Yes, I know what it is.
- Oh.

657
00:47:12,161 --> 00:47:13,721
Well, I named it, you know.

658
00:47:13,761 --> 00:47:16,441
Yes, yes - what about it?
Well, we're going to use it.

659
00:47:16,921 --> 00:47:19,761
Ok, imagine... Excuse me.

660
00:47:20,601 --> 00:47:23,481
Imagine this is the ionosphere...

661
00:47:23,521 --> 00:47:25,921
Right? And... Can you hold that?

662
00:47:25,961 --> 00:47:27,761
And my head is the earth.

663
00:47:27,801 --> 00:47:30,321
So instead of sending pulses
from the earth

664
00:47:30,361 --> 00:47:33,201
that go up and across the earth.

665
00:47:33,241 --> 00:47:37,321
We're sending pulses up from the earth
and bouncing them off the ionosphere

666
00:47:37,361 --> 00:47:39,681
back to earth, ionosphere,
earth, ionosphere...

667
00:47:39,721 --> 00:47:42,321
Bouncing makes our pulses go further.

668
00:47:42,361 --> 00:47:47,201
Like skimming stones across water,
or water with a ceiling.

669
00:47:48,201 --> 00:47:51,921
A swimming pool.
A swimming pool with a low ceiling.

670
00:47:51,961 --> 00:47:56,121
Or throwing a bottle across wet grass,
or a ping-pong ball...

671
00:47:56,161 --> 00:47:59,321
Anyway, that, in a nutshell,
is what we're planning to do today.

672
00:47:59,361 --> 00:48:01,081
Send a pulse up to the ionosphere?

673
00:48:01,121 --> 00:48:04,721
We did it yesterday. We bounced it
off the ionosphere sixty miles!

674
00:48:04,761 --> 00:48:06,441
Sixty miles - can you imagine that?

675
00:48:06,481 --> 00:48:09,161
And your pulse hit something?
You detected aircraft?

676
00:48:09,201 --> 00:48:10,921
Not exactly, no.

677
00:48:10,961 --> 00:48:12,001
Exactly?

678
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:13,761
- At all.
- Right.

679
00:48:13,801 --> 00:48:16,081
But there may not
have been anything in the air

680
00:48:16,121 --> 00:48:18,841
on that particular frequency
at a particular time.

681
00:48:18,881 --> 00:48:22,321
Don't worry, I've arranged for an aeroplane
to be flying through our net today

682
00:48:22,361 --> 00:48:24,441
so fingers crossed this works.

683
00:48:24,481 --> 00:48:25,521
'Fingers crossed'?

684
00:48:34,761 --> 00:48:36,001
Here you go.

685
00:48:37,761 --> 00:48:39,721
Er, gentlemen.

686
00:48:40,401 --> 00:48:44,321
Apologies for the condition of this hut.

687
00:48:44,801 --> 00:48:47,881
Erm, we have built a new transmitter

688
00:48:47,921 --> 00:48:50,881
which has given us
increased power and efficiency

689
00:48:50,921 --> 00:48:56,001
and also increases our potential of
detecting aircraft from greater distances.

690
00:48:56,641 --> 00:48:59,641
We've also used our extensive
knowledge of weather systems

691
00:48:59,681 --> 00:49:04,161
to send a radio pulse further
than science could ever have imagined.

692
00:49:04,201 --> 00:49:06,561
All of this on a shoestring budget.

693
00:49:08,721 --> 00:49:09,521
So...

694
00:49:09,561 --> 00:49:10,921
Where's the plane?

695
00:49:10,961 --> 00:49:12,001
I don't know...

696
00:49:12,041 --> 00:49:15,561
Any of your Oxbridge chums know
anything about weather systems?

697
00:49:15,601 --> 00:49:16,681
God no!

698
00:49:17,481 --> 00:49:20,041
But they do know how
to mix a decent martini.

699
00:49:20,561 --> 00:49:23,761
This bunch of barbarians
think a martini is a Greek Island.

700
00:49:23,801 --> 00:49:26,441
Funding. Always a tricky thing.

701
00:49:26,481 --> 00:49:30,121
I understand the pressures but
its chicken... Chicken and egg.

702
00:49:30,161 --> 00:49:31,641
Chicken and egg.

703
00:49:31,681 --> 00:49:35,601
If we want more eggs,
we need more chickens.

704
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:38,161
Which is funding.

705
00:49:41,361 --> 00:49:44,241
It's better not talking about
the chickens and the eggs.

706
00:49:45,001 --> 00:49:48,481
So, this is quite a thing. Erm...

707
00:49:49,521 --> 00:49:51,201
Just do something.

708
00:49:51,241 --> 00:49:52,361
You do something!

709
00:49:52,401 --> 00:49:54,041
Ok...

710
00:49:54,481 --> 00:49:57,281
Erm... So...

711
00:49:58,041 --> 00:50:00,601
Ah... Ah! Can you see this?

712
00:50:01,481 --> 00:50:05,361
If I could just listen there.
Thank you, Higgy...

713
00:50:05,401 --> 00:50:08,161
That is a bounce.

714
00:50:09,241 --> 00:50:12,001
Yes, that... that is a bounce.

715
00:50:12,041 --> 00:50:13,601
Thank you. That is a bounce!

716
00:50:13,641 --> 00:50:18,241
We are detecting
a bounce of our pulse

717
00:50:19,281 --> 00:50:23,201
that is bouncing of the ionosphere
and across the earth!

718
00:50:23,241 --> 00:50:25,321
How many miles is that?

719
00:50:25,361 --> 00:50:28,001
Er... Sixty miles...

720
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:30,801
Sixty miles. Sixty miles!

721
00:50:31,401 --> 00:50:38,361
If that was an enemy aircraft, that would
give us about a 20-minute warning!

722
00:50:38,401 --> 00:50:42,081
So, there, as you can see...

723
00:50:42,121 --> 00:50:43,401
Help me out, lads!

724
00:50:43,961 --> 00:50:46,001
Er, this is astonishing!

725
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:47,681
Please, come.

726
00:50:47,721 --> 00:50:49,241
Do... Yes... Absolutely...

727
00:50:49,281 --> 00:50:52,201
Higgy, punch it up on the oscilloscope will you?
- Come for a closer look.

728
00:50:54,041 --> 00:50:55,081
'Punch it up?'

729
00:50:55,121 --> 00:50:57,961
It's not the most attractive of set-ups

730
00:50:58,001 --> 00:51:00,521
but there is a lot of substance,
a lot of sophistication.

731
00:51:05,721 --> 00:51:08,241
AEROPLANE OVERHEAD

732
00:51:17,281 --> 00:51:19,521
Thank you.

733
00:51:24,441 --> 00:51:27,041
They all seemed suitably impressed
with your theatrics.

734
00:51:27,081 --> 00:51:28,521
So we'll get the money?

735
00:51:28,561 --> 00:51:32,001
Getting money for this project was hard
enough when MacDonald was Prime Minister.

736
00:51:32,041 --> 00:51:34,121
And now Baldwin's PM...?

737
00:51:35,001 --> 00:51:37,321
What's going on, Henry?

738
00:51:37,361 --> 00:51:40,921
I mean, something's going on, otherwise
we wouldn't be having this conversation.

739
00:51:42,201 --> 00:51:44,721
Churchill's clawing his way in
from the back benches.

740
00:51:44,761 --> 00:51:48,801
He's persuaded the PM to let him
chair a new research group

741
00:51:48,841 --> 00:51:51,841
and has installed his main advisor -
Professor Lindemann -

742
00:51:51,881 --> 00:51:53,961
on a sub-committee, above us.

743
00:51:54,001 --> 00:51:58,361
Lindemann wants to direct our funding
to build a strike force to hit Germany.

744
00:51:58,401 --> 00:52:02,481
It's early days for Churchill
and Lindemann but they're waiting...

745
00:52:03,201 --> 00:52:07,001
The slightest of hiccups,
they'll seize on it and shut us down.

746
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:08,681
PHONE RINGS

747
00:52:09,681 --> 00:52:11,081
Hello?

748
00:52:14,521 --> 00:52:15,761
Yes.

749
00:52:17,001 --> 00:52:19,761
The Air Ministry were impressed?

750
00:52:22,121 --> 00:52:26,601
Well, it would appear that Watson-Watt
has a cunning streak of his own...

751
00:52:28,041 --> 00:52:29,761
Yes, thank you.

752
00:52:29,801 --> 00:52:31,681
Keep me informed of
any further developments.

753
00:52:31,721 --> 00:52:32,721
Sir.

754
00:52:35,401 --> 00:52:38,361
Yesterday wasn't a success.

755
00:52:38,401 --> 00:52:41,281
We proved we can bounce
a signal over long distances

756
00:52:41,321 --> 00:52:46,001
but we failed to detect an aeroplane
flying right over our heads.

757
00:52:46,561 --> 00:52:48,161
Why?

758
00:52:48,201 --> 00:52:49,761
Calculation error?

759
00:52:49,801 --> 00:52:51,081
Not a chance.

760
00:52:51,121 --> 00:52:53,081
Range and target?
We've got something now!

761
00:52:53,121 --> 00:52:54,241
What?

762
00:52:56,801 --> 00:52:59,041
Aircraft.
Why couldn't we see this yesterday?

763
00:52:59,081 --> 00:53:01,561
The equipment's not good enough.

764
00:53:01,601 --> 00:53:03,441
It's the same as it was yesterday.

765
00:53:03,481 --> 00:53:05,241
But now it's working.

766
00:53:07,921 --> 00:53:10,841
Thank you. Thank you very much.

767
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:22,601
The Air Station has confirmed
our blip is one of their aircraft...

768
00:53:22,641 --> 00:53:26,201
We've got a moving target
and it was seventeen miles away!

769
00:53:27,521 --> 00:53:30,601
And we could tell where it's going
and how fast! We've gotta celebrate!

770
00:53:30,641 --> 00:53:32,801
Before we get too
carried away with our success

771
00:53:32,841 --> 00:53:36,481
we have to get this working
all the time, every time.

772
00:53:36,521 --> 00:53:39,801
Whenever the Germans
fly their aeroplanes through our pulses.

773
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:42,201
That's the problem, right there, isn't it?

774
00:53:42,721 --> 00:53:45,681
Our pulse works in
a range of seventeen miles

775
00:53:46,521 --> 00:53:49,761
but we've got thousands of miles
of coastline, not just seventeen.

776
00:53:49,801 --> 00:53:53,161
One station can't protect
the entire country.

777
00:54:17,481 --> 00:54:19,321
Are you alright? You look awful.

778
00:54:23,881 --> 00:54:25,241
We're ready for you.

779
00:54:28,041 --> 00:54:35,041
The Nazis have passed a law
for 'the protection of German blood'.

780
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:39,961
It is the act of a megalomaniac!

781
00:54:41,481 --> 00:54:44,041
A man who will wage war

782
00:54:44,521 --> 00:54:48,961
and systematically destroy
everyone and everything in his path.

783
00:54:49,001 --> 00:54:55,001
They are churning out planes
day and night, whilst you lot...

784
00:54:56,401 --> 00:55:01,241
are sat with your thumbs up your arses
building a castle in the bloody sky!

785
00:55:01,281 --> 00:55:03,801
That may or may not work.

786
00:55:03,841 --> 00:55:08,561
And now, you tell us
that one castle is not enough.

787
00:55:09,361 --> 00:55:13,681
I've been entrusted with
overseeing your operation.

788
00:55:14,401 --> 00:55:18,001
It is my neck on the block here.

789
00:55:19,481 --> 00:55:22,801
You've had money
to develop this thing

790
00:55:22,841 --> 00:55:26,921
and now you would like a lot more money

791
00:55:26,961 --> 00:55:32,481
to build a lot more things
that may or may not work.

792
00:55:34,201 --> 00:55:41,281
You wouldn't try to protect our entire
country with just one castle, would you?

793
00:55:45,001 --> 00:55:46,961
One castle...

794
00:55:47,001 --> 00:55:51,041
Our enemies would side-step it,
they would go around it.

795
00:55:51,601 --> 00:55:55,041
So what I am proposing, if I may...

796
00:55:56,761 --> 00:56:00,721
are a series of castles

797
00:56:01,281 --> 00:56:05,281
twenty miles apart,
stretched out along the coastline.

798
00:56:05,721 --> 00:56:07,161
Now, each...

799
00:56:10,081 --> 00:56:15,681
each castle sends out a fishing line

800
00:56:16,201 --> 00:56:18,361
which individually is not that effective

801
00:56:18,401 --> 00:56:21,601
but together it is like casting a net

802
00:56:21,641 --> 00:56:26,961
all working together as a group
to identify enemy aircraft

803
00:56:27,001 --> 00:56:30,001
pin-pointing where they are
and where they're heading.

804
00:56:30,481 --> 00:56:32,401
This gives us time.

805
00:56:32,841 --> 00:56:39,241
Time to prepare our men,
deploy our planes and build our defence.

806
00:56:39,281 --> 00:56:44,801
I suggest we abandon this project
and channel our resources into attack.

807
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:47,641
We must build more bombers.

808
00:56:47,681 --> 00:56:49,721
We'll never match the Luftwaffe
in terms of numbers!

809
00:56:49,881 --> 00:56:52,801
I think we are all agreed
our resources are limited.

810
00:56:52,841 --> 00:56:56,641
So limited, in fact, that some of your men
took it upon themselves

811
00:56:56,681 --> 00:56:59,681
to steal equipment from a naval base.

812
00:57:00,441 --> 00:57:02,561
Or were they just following your orders?

813
00:57:02,601 --> 00:57:04,081
I know nothing about that.

814
00:57:04,121 --> 00:57:05,881
Of course not.

815
00:57:05,921 --> 00:57:09,761
I believe that we should use
our limited funds on defence.

816
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:11,481
Attack is the best form of defence!

817
00:57:11,521 --> 00:57:14,001
People will die.
That's what happens in war!

818
00:57:14,041 --> 00:57:15,721
People die!

819
00:57:15,761 --> 00:57:20,401
You can't reasonably think to wage
a war where no one dies, Henry!

820
00:57:20,441 --> 00:57:23,601
Given... recent history

821
00:57:24,481 --> 00:57:27,361
and what each and every one of us
here in this room have witnessed

822
00:57:29,041 --> 00:57:31,681
what would be so wrong in trying?

823
00:57:34,041 --> 00:57:38,401
We are already building
as many more new planes

824
00:57:38,441 --> 00:57:40,521
as the government will stomach.

825
00:57:42,201 --> 00:57:46,401
We can try to build a few more still.

826
00:57:48,961 --> 00:57:52,601
Or... we build this.

827
00:57:54,801 --> 00:57:57,441
If this thing works

828
00:57:57,481 --> 00:58:02,041
the planes we do have
will become much more effective.

829
00:58:03,001 --> 00:58:07,001
It will give us a huge
advantage over the Germans.

830
00:58:07,041 --> 00:58:08,841
A crucial advantage.

831
00:58:08,881 --> 00:58:10,961
But what if it doesn't?

832
00:58:13,241 --> 00:58:15,961
For the time being

833
00:58:16,401 --> 00:58:23,201
we will invest our money,
our faith and our prayers

834
00:58:25,681 --> 00:58:28,041
in your castles in the sky.

835
00:58:32,281 --> 00:58:33,961
Now...

836
00:58:34,721 --> 00:58:37,521
Go and see if you can get
the bloody thing to work.

837
00:58:39,561 --> 00:58:42,641
Lindemann knew about the navy equipment.

838
00:58:43,161 --> 00:58:44,481
HOW?

839
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,281
I don't know...

840
00:58:53,521 --> 00:58:55,521
Careful with that, lads.

841
00:59:10,761 --> 00:59:12,441
This is a step up...

842
00:59:18,001 --> 00:59:21,081
Gentlemen, welcome to Bawdsey Manor!

843
00:59:32,241 --> 00:59:33,641
We're starting again?

844
00:59:36,361 --> 00:59:39,441
We have a whole new set of challenges.

845
00:59:39,481 --> 00:59:42,641
We need to develop five stations.

846
00:59:43,081 --> 00:59:46,881
A chain of stations stretching from here
all the way down to Sussex

847
00:59:46,921 --> 00:59:48,281
covering the approach to London.

848
00:59:48,321 --> 00:59:50,441
- Five stations?
- To begin with.

849
00:59:50,481 --> 00:59:52,401
But we haven't got one
working consistently.

850
00:59:52,441 --> 00:59:54,681
You know that one is not enough.
But it won't work!

851
00:59:54,721 --> 00:59:57,481
Not unless all of the stations are in sync

852
00:59:57,521 --> 01:00:00,001
communicating with each other,
sending out the same pulses.

853
01:00:00,961 --> 01:00:02,121
Ok.

854
01:00:07,001 --> 01:00:10,081
No. We're not ready for all that!
We've got to be.

855
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:13,121
People are depending on us -
not just Ministry people.

856
01:00:13,161 --> 01:00:15,521
Our people. I mean our loved ones...

857
01:00:16,201 --> 01:00:19,841
Hitler is creating a force
that will vastly outnumber ours...

858
01:00:19,881 --> 01:00:21,481
If Britain is ever attacked

859
01:00:21,521 --> 01:00:25,161
our system may be the only chance
of levelling the playing field.

860
01:00:25,201 --> 01:00:26,881
This is real.

861
01:00:26,921 --> 01:00:28,841
I mean this is very real.

862
01:00:29,041 --> 01:00:32,361
And we few in this room may be
the only people in the country

863
01:00:32,401 --> 01:00:34,561
who can do something about this.

864
01:00:36,441 --> 01:00:37,801
Scale.

865
01:00:37,841 --> 01:00:39,761
You gotta put scale up there.

866
01:00:40,841 --> 01:00:44,521
And range. You think you've
solved range but you haven't.

867
01:00:44,561 --> 01:00:48,161
And what happens if the aircraft
flies perpendicular to our pulses?

868
01:00:48,201 --> 01:00:50,441
What if there is a formation
of small planes?

869
01:00:50,481 --> 01:00:54,561
How do we identify the target if we have
spikey noise returns on the display?

870
01:01:24,001 --> 01:01:25,281
Robert!

871
01:01:25,321 --> 01:01:27,601
The first round is on me
but that's your lot.

872
01:01:27,641 --> 01:01:29,561
I wasn't going to ask you that.

873
01:01:30,121 --> 01:01:32,601
Just after you left, your wife called.

874
01:01:32,641 --> 01:01:34,921
She said to wish you
a happy anniversary.

875
01:01:42,961 --> 01:01:45,201
WIRELESS

876
01:01:46,641 --> 01:01:52,641
<i>by force, in such a way
as to threaten British Independence...</i>

877
01:01:53,161 --> 01:01:54,481
Come on!

878
01:02:03,241 --> 01:02:04,881
It's going well!

879
01:02:05,361 --> 01:02:08,561
Wahey, Taff!
You know what you have to do!

880
01:02:08,601 --> 01:02:11,121
Come on, Taff! Here we go, come on!

881
01:02:13,001 --> 01:02:15,001
Fellas... Keep it down!

882
01:02:16,601 --> 01:02:20,121
<i>The distribution of gas masks
began tonight in all areas.</i>

883
01:02:20,161 --> 01:02:21,681
<i>The Home Office, in announcing this...</i>

884
01:02:22,001 --> 01:02:23,921
Where's Rob?
He's in the doghouse.

885
01:02:25,041 --> 01:02:27,601
His wife called,
he missed their anniversary.

886
01:02:27,641 --> 01:02:29,801
PHONE RINGS

887
01:02:44,561 --> 01:02:46,641
Did you make it up to Margaret?

888
01:02:46,681 --> 01:02:48,801
I don't know where she is.

889
01:02:50,001 --> 01:02:54,001
I should be there,
at home, not here.

890
01:02:56,041 --> 01:02:58,521
This is a waste of time.

891
01:02:58,561 --> 01:03:00,641
Not for them, it's not.

892
01:03:00,681 --> 01:03:03,601
Their first night out in weeks,
a couple of pints...

893
01:03:03,641 --> 01:03:06,081
Not this here, tonight, all of it.

894
01:03:07,121 --> 01:03:09,121
Rowe was right.

895
01:03:09,161 --> 01:03:12,561
They should have professors
tasked to do this, not us.

896
01:03:12,601 --> 01:03:14,801
I should be at home with Margaret

897
01:03:14,841 --> 01:03:18,521
eating dinner, listening to
the wireless, going to bed...

898
01:03:18,561 --> 01:03:21,121
Waiting for the bombs to drop?
We can't do this!

899
01:03:21,161 --> 01:03:25,961
People will die because of us
and our bloody-minded pride

900
01:03:26,001 --> 01:03:28,401
and our ineptitude and our stupidity!

901
01:03:28,441 --> 01:03:30,001
This will not work!

902
01:03:30,041 --> 01:03:32,001
Don't say this won't work!

903
01:03:35,961 --> 01:03:38,601
You are not allowed to give up!

904
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:41,401
We are - you're not!

905
01:03:42,521 --> 01:03:46,321
Something will shift, something will
happen and we'll get our answers.

906
01:03:47,081 --> 01:03:49,361
Don't you ever give up.

907
01:03:55,041 --> 01:03:56,681
We just don't have time.

908
01:03:56,721 --> 01:04:01,041
It's like trying to catch
a shoal of fish with one line.

909
01:04:01,081 --> 01:04:02,921
We need a net, a big net.

910
01:04:03,561 --> 01:04:05,401
Multiple stations.

911
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:07,921
And that way we will solve range.

912
01:04:09,641 --> 01:04:11,721
That will solve range.

913
01:04:13,001 --> 01:04:15,921
We need to cover every inch of coastline.

914
01:04:16,361 --> 01:04:18,801
Am I building two for now?

915
01:04:20,321 --> 01:04:21,921
Then five.

916
01:04:21,961 --> 01:04:24,081
If we can make two work.

917
01:04:24,961 --> 01:04:27,081
Five will be easy?

918
01:04:28,481 --> 01:04:29,761
Easy?

919
01:04:31,001 --> 01:04:32,201
Easier...

920
01:04:38,801 --> 01:04:40,841
You are bloody annoying, you know!

921
01:04:40,881 --> 01:04:42,841
Margaret always says that.

922
01:04:47,001 --> 01:04:48,441
Ta.

923
01:04:48,881 --> 01:04:52,681
Something shifts. Something happens.

924
01:05:15,761 --> 01:05:17,961
They've come to see
five stations working together.

925
01:05:18,001 --> 01:05:20,561
And we only have two...
They don't know that.

926
01:05:20,601 --> 01:05:21,881
Exactly.

927
01:05:35,921 --> 01:05:37,641
You think this will work?
I hope so, sir.

928
01:05:37,681 --> 01:05:39,161
All five stations?

929
01:05:41,321 --> 01:05:43,721
There are five? Correct?

930
01:05:51,201 --> 01:05:55,081
We will show you how two stations
communicating together

931
01:05:55,121 --> 01:05:58,441
can detect planes at greater distances.

932
01:05:58,481 --> 01:06:02,281
The planes for today's demonstration
are already in the air.

933
01:06:02,321 --> 01:06:05,481
Due to the obvious
time constraints, gentlemen

934
01:06:05,521 --> 01:06:10,161
we have decided to go for quality
rather than quantity.

935
01:06:10,201 --> 01:06:14,921
All our energies are being thrown
into showing and demonstrating

936
01:06:14,961 --> 01:06:22,361
the capabilities of this particular station,
linked to a second station just along the coast.

937
01:06:23,481 --> 01:06:26,601
So I think the time is just about right.

938
01:06:28,321 --> 01:06:34,801
Our two stations are now sending out
pulses across the coast, like so...

939
01:06:38,481 --> 01:06:44,001
And waiting for an echo back
from something out there.

940
01:06:44,961 --> 01:06:47,401
Something out there...

941
01:06:47,441 --> 01:06:50,881
A formation of aircraft are right now
just turning towards us

942
01:06:50,921 --> 01:06:53,121
and heading back in our direction.

943
01:06:53,161 --> 01:06:57,201
They will be called the invading force -
bombers, gentlemen!

944
01:06:57,241 --> 01:07:00,081
Which we shall detect,
heading our way

945
01:07:00,121 --> 01:07:05,441
ready to drop their deadly cargo
upon our heads...

946
01:07:11,921 --> 01:07:13,881
Just waiting here...

947
01:07:16,761 --> 01:07:20,001
The invading force should
be due any minute.

948
01:07:23,161 --> 01:07:25,641
AIRCRAFT OVERHEAD

949
01:07:25,681 --> 01:07:27,481
Red leader, in position.

950
01:07:33,001 --> 01:07:35,681
We've got 'em.
We've already heard them.

951
01:07:35,721 --> 01:07:37,481
With our ears.

952
01:07:37,521 --> 01:07:40,641
The 'invading Force'
have dropped their deadly cargo.

953
01:07:41,401 --> 01:07:43,481
We are all dead.

954
01:07:49,921 --> 01:07:51,121
As you can see, gentlemen

955
01:07:51,161 --> 01:07:55,121
we're having a slight technical issue
with our first demonstration.

956
01:07:55,161 --> 01:07:59,481
So if you'd like to avail yourselves
of the light refreshments we've laid on

957
01:07:59,521 --> 01:08:03,641
and we'll commence with the second
demonstration in forty-five minutes.

958
01:08:03,681 --> 01:08:05,161
Thank you.

959
01:08:09,681 --> 01:08:11,281
Second demonstration?

960
01:08:11,321 --> 01:08:13,121
I couldn't leave you hanging there,
I had to say something.

961
01:08:13,161 --> 01:08:14,441
We're going to fail twice?

962
01:08:14,481 --> 01:08:16,121
I've got a plan.

963
01:08:25,161 --> 01:08:29,041
I've had concerns for some time
about this radio locator.

964
01:08:29,081 --> 01:08:31,481
Yes of course, of course,
there are benefits

965
01:08:31,921 --> 01:08:34,201
if it is proven to work

966
01:08:34,241 --> 01:08:35,921
but as we've just seen...

967
01:08:35,961 --> 01:08:38,361
We didn't have time to test
our beautiful new receiver

968
01:08:38,401 --> 01:08:40,121
I don't think it works.

969
01:08:40,161 --> 01:08:41,801
What are you doing?

970
01:08:43,241 --> 01:08:44,641
Old faithful!

971
01:08:44,681 --> 01:08:46,001
Shouldn't take long.

972
01:08:46,041 --> 01:08:48,121
- Will it work?
- Honest answer?

973
01:08:52,801 --> 01:08:56,281
How is it that Lindemann is
up to speed on everything we do?

974
01:08:56,321 --> 01:09:00,081
He asked about the five stations,
straight away, the moment he arrived.

975
01:09:00,801 --> 01:09:05,881
Lindemann has been up to speed
on every problem we have ever had.

976
01:09:07,401 --> 01:09:12,361
And why is it that the first person to point
out the flaws in whatever we are doing...

977
01:09:13,001 --> 01:09:16,001
always Higgy?

978
01:09:18,201 --> 01:09:20,521
It's like he's looking for problems.

979
01:09:25,841 --> 01:09:27,961
Do us a favour will you, lad?

980
01:09:28,001 --> 01:09:30,881
Go fetch a roll of cable. Might as well
wire up the new one just in case.

981
01:09:31,201 --> 01:09:33,841
- Covering all bases?
- Aye.

982
01:09:46,561 --> 01:09:47,801
We know.

983
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:49,601
What?

984
01:09:50,721 --> 01:09:52,601
That you've been spying on us.

985
01:09:53,481 --> 01:09:55,801
I don't know what you're talking about.

986
01:09:56,641 --> 01:09:57,801
It's treason.

987
01:09:58,481 --> 01:10:00,561
They will hang you.

988
01:10:02,441 --> 01:10:03,961
Lindemann said nothing would happen!

989
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:06,561
He said I had to do it

990
01:10:07,721 --> 01:10:10,041
that the safety of the nation
depended on it!

991
01:10:10,081 --> 01:10:12,681
You compromised the safety of the nation!

992
01:10:12,721 --> 01:10:13,881
Rob. They're only in there.

993
01:10:13,921 --> 01:10:15,481
I trusted you!

994
01:10:15,521 --> 01:10:16,761
I want this to work as much as you.

995
01:10:16,801 --> 01:10:17,801
No, you don't!

996
01:10:17,841 --> 01:10:20,641
You go on about the problems,
how it's not going to work -

997
01:10:20,681 --> 01:10:23,321
And if I hadn't we might not have found
the faults with it until it was too late!

998
01:10:23,361 --> 01:10:25,001
I want to help you build it, Rob!

999
01:10:25,041 --> 01:10:27,321
You report everything
back to Lindemann!

1000
01:10:27,361 --> 01:10:29,441
You promised the impossible.

1001
01:10:30,281 --> 01:10:33,281
Did you really think they'd just
leave you to get on with it?

1002
01:10:33,681 --> 01:10:35,641
What is going on?
We can all hear a row.

1003
01:10:35,681 --> 01:10:37,561
Did you put a spy in my camp?

1004
01:10:37,601 --> 01:10:38,521
Excuse me?

1005
01:10:38,561 --> 01:10:41,121
Is this just Lindemann
or are you in on it too?

1006
01:10:41,641 --> 01:10:43,641
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1007
01:10:43,681 --> 01:10:46,881
How much longer do you expect
the Air Chief Marshall to wait?

1008
01:10:48,241 --> 01:10:49,561
I'm sorry, sir.

1009
01:10:49,601 --> 01:10:50,881
We'll be with you in just a moment.

1010
01:10:50,921 --> 01:10:52,441
Two minutes.

1011
01:10:55,841 --> 01:10:57,521
Let us make this thing work!

1012
01:10:58,241 --> 01:10:59,361
NOT you!

1013
01:11:00,681 --> 01:11:01,881
Your time is over.

1014
01:11:03,201 --> 01:11:05,041
Goodbye.

1015
01:11:09,481 --> 01:11:10,721
Chaps?

1016
01:11:27,281 --> 01:11:30,521
I am in favour of anything
that helps us win this war.

1017
01:11:30,561 --> 01:11:32,441
Your failure helps no one.

1018
01:12:28,281 --> 01:12:30,281
If you'll excuse us, gentlemen

1019
01:12:30,321 --> 01:12:32,921
it's time we were
heading back to London.

1020
01:12:34,961 --> 01:12:37,001
We've got a trace.
Clear signal on visual display.

1021
01:12:37,721 --> 01:12:40,321
What range?
How far away are the aircraft?

1022
01:12:40,361 --> 01:12:41,441
Sixty three miles!

1023
01:12:43,041 --> 01:12:44,041
It's working?

1024
01:12:44,081 --> 01:12:45,201
It's working.

1025
01:12:45,241 --> 01:12:47,641
We can see them,
sixty three miles away.

1026
01:12:47,681 --> 01:12:49,401
Our sister base have
confirmed the sighting...

1027
01:12:49,441 --> 01:12:52,041
five aircraft sixty three miles out,
heading in our direction.

1028
01:12:52,081 --> 01:12:56,721
That gives us twenty one minutes
to scramble our aircraft and intercept!

1029
01:12:56,761 --> 01:13:01,281
Gentlemen - we have a castle in the sky.

1030
01:13:08,401 --> 01:13:10,121
Air Chief Marshall!

1031
01:13:14,161 --> 01:13:16,281
You must be very pleased?

1032
01:13:16,321 --> 01:13:18,281
I am indeed. Overwhelmed.

1033
01:13:19,561 --> 01:13:22,521
Thank you, Swingate, track 165.
Five aircraft heading north.

1034
01:13:22,561 --> 01:13:23,721
Congratulations!

1035
01:13:23,761 --> 01:13:27,321
Track 165. Range fifty eight
miles and closing.

1036
01:13:30,801 --> 01:13:31,921
Robert...

1037
01:13:33,921 --> 01:13:37,041
We are rather pleased
your radio-locator is working.

1038
01:13:37,081 --> 01:13:40,121
Despite your efforts
gathering information against us?

1039
01:13:41,401 --> 01:13:45,001
Your mole, Higgy?

1040
01:13:45,041 --> 01:13:46,641
We don't need him anymore.

1041
01:13:46,681 --> 01:13:49,241
Neither do I.
He's quite dispensable.

1042
01:13:52,881 --> 01:13:56,321
Our radio locator is imperfect,
as you know.

1043
01:13:56,361 --> 01:13:58,921
It's range is limited and unreliable

1044
01:13:58,961 --> 01:14:01,881
and the system's not yet
proven at low altitude.

1045
01:14:02,401 --> 01:14:03,561
We're working on that.

1046
01:14:03,601 --> 01:14:06,161
Germany is building new aeroplanes -

1047
01:14:06,201 --> 01:14:09,561
smaller, lighter aircraft
that can fly lower.

1048
01:14:09,601 --> 01:14:12,841
They might just get under your net.

1049
01:14:12,881 --> 01:14:15,561
You have to prepare
for such eventualities.

1050
01:14:16,001 --> 01:14:20,481
If you don't feel quite up to it,
we can call in the right people.

1051
01:14:20,521 --> 01:14:23,201
There's no shame in handing it over.

1052
01:14:23,921 --> 01:14:25,521
For the good of the country.

1053
01:14:28,761 --> 01:14:30,961
You've done your bit, Robert.

1054
01:14:33,201 --> 01:14:34,841
Have a think.

1055
01:14:59,561 --> 01:15:00,761
Robert?

1056
01:15:02,201 --> 01:15:08,481
We have to develop equipment that can
detect aircraft at lower altitudes.

1057
01:15:09,481 --> 01:15:11,961
Equipment that's smaller -
small enough to be mobile.

1058
01:15:12,001 --> 01:15:15,561
You've seen what we're working with -
it's the size of a kitchen.

1059
01:15:15,601 --> 01:15:17,041
We have to shrink it,
there's no other way.

1060
01:15:17,081 --> 01:15:20,481
We can't shrink it! Just look at
the size of the valves we're using!

1061
01:15:20,521 --> 01:15:23,521
We'll have to build smaller valves.

1062
01:15:24,121 --> 01:15:25,281
HOW?

1063
01:15:28,001 --> 01:15:29,281
I don't know yet.

1064
01:15:55,561 --> 01:15:57,841
PHONE RINGS

1065
01:16:01,801 --> 01:16:03,441
- Hello?
- Robert.

1066
01:16:04,161 --> 01:16:05,321
Is everything alright?

1067
01:16:05,361 --> 01:16:07,561
Everything's fine... yes...

1068
01:16:07,601 --> 01:16:13,121
I'm calling because I'm alone,
listening to the wireless

1069
01:16:13,161 --> 01:16:15,481
and AI Bowlly just came on

1070
01:16:15,521 --> 01:16:20,241
and the you not being here-ness
just hit me like a wave.

1071
01:16:20,281 --> 01:16:22,441
I'm listening to it.

1072
01:16:22,481 --> 01:16:23,841
You can hear it too?

1073
01:16:23,881 --> 01:16:25,401
Yes, my darling.

1074
01:16:26,041 --> 01:16:27,201
Dance with me.

1075
01:16:27,241 --> 01:16:28,761
Dance with you?

1076
01:16:29,961 --> 01:16:34,081
Yes, it'll feel like we're together again.

1077
01:16:35,801 --> 01:16:40,641
Come on, close your eyes and imagine.

1078
01:16:44,161 --> 01:16:46,401
You're a magician aren't you?

1079
01:16:46,441 --> 01:16:48,521
Make the invisible visible?

1080
01:16:52,841 --> 01:16:55,281
I remember dancing
like this with you once.

1081
01:16:55,321 --> 01:16:56,681
Our wedding.

1082
01:16:56,721 --> 01:16:59,561
All of them around us in a circle.

1083
01:16:59,601 --> 01:17:03,081
All of them there yet
none of them there, just you and me...

1084
01:17:07,721 --> 01:17:09,801
I need you to hold me, Robert.

1085
01:17:10,841 --> 01:17:13,121
I need you with me.

1086
01:17:13,161 --> 01:17:14,961
Come home.

1087
01:17:18,721 --> 01:17:20,281
Please.

1088
01:17:20,321 --> 01:17:23,761
When all of this is over,
when all your work is done.

1089
01:17:23,801 --> 01:17:26,281
Come home, Robert.

1090
01:17:27,401 --> 01:17:31,121
Yes, I promise Mags.

1091
01:17:33,681 --> 01:17:35,761
<i>WIRELESS

Oxford 143 please.

1099
01:18:03,161 --> 01:18:04,881
- Yes?
- Professor...

1100
01:18:05,841 --> 01:18:07,641
I need your help.

1101
01:18:08,081 --> 01:18:09,561
Yes.

1102
01:18:31,561 --> 01:18:33,281
What is this about?

1103
01:18:33,321 --> 01:18:34,681
I don't know.

1104
01:18:46,441 --> 01:18:47,241
Hello.

1105
01:18:47,281 --> 01:18:49,841
Now, last night...

1106
01:18:50,641 --> 01:18:52,961
I was thinking of walking away

1107
01:18:53,001 --> 01:18:55,921
handing the whole project over to
Lindemann and just going home.

1108
01:18:56,521 --> 01:19:01,081
And then I heard on the wireless
an advertisement

1109
01:19:01,121 --> 01:19:06,241
for these very expensive,
but wondrous televisions.

1110
01:19:07,681 --> 01:19:09,161
And...

1111
01:19:14,401 --> 01:19:22,401
they have engineered for television
very small valves.

1112
01:19:23,281 --> 01:19:26,481
Smaller valves means smaller equipment

1113
01:19:26,521 --> 01:19:31,361
and they have also been designed for a
higher frequency on a shorter wavelength

1114
01:19:31,401 --> 01:19:35,961
which means we'll be able to stop

Ah! My pen, isn't it?

1141
01:24:16,841 --> 01:24:17,841
Now, if you wouldn't mind...

1142
01:24:17,881 --> 01:24:22,321
No. I do have to see
if the system actually works!
