1
00:00:15,826 --> 00:00:16,796
Are you afraid?

2
00:00:17,237 --> 00:00:19,630
No, I'm not afraid.

3
00:00:33,311 --> 00:00:40,809
Express 290 with destination Germany
now arriving on Track One.

4
00:00:40,954 --> 00:00:45,809
Departure time 21:00

5
00:01:02,872 --> 00:01:04,944
Your attention please!

6
00:01:05,095 --> 00:01:11,206
Express 290 for Germany
arriving on Track One.

7
00:01:26,952 --> 00:01:28,609
You here again?

8
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,460
What are you doing here
night after night?

9
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,413
I dreamt about him last night.

10
00:01:57,555 --> 00:02:00,611
He seemed bigger than the other times.

11
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,249
Come on!

12
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:11,643
LANDSCAPE IN THE MIST

13
00:03:12,064 --> 00:03:16,055
a film by Theo Angelopoulos

14
00:05:27,978 --> 00:05:29,434
Go to sleep!

15
00:05:30,513 --> 00:05:32,526
When are we going away?

16
00:05:33,397 --> 00:05:34,569
Go to sleep!

17
00:05:34,717 --> 00:05:38,909
- Will you tell me the story? <br />
- Again?

18
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:48,882
In the beginning was the darkness...
and then there was light.

19
00:05:49,097 --> 00:05:52,675
And the light was divided
from the darkness...

20
00:05:52,814 --> 00:06:02,669
and the earth from the sea...
and the rivers, the lakes...

21
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:09,511
and the mountains were made
And then the flowers and the trees...

22
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:13,925
the animals... the birds...

23
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,740
It's Mummy!

24
00:06:17,094 --> 00:06:19,664
This story will never finish.

25
00:06:19,804 --> 00:06:22,540
She keeps coming
and stopping us all the time.

26
00:08:00,295 --> 00:08:02,236
Hello Seagull!

27
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,127
Seagull!

28
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,122
Hello, Seagull!

29
00:08:31,141 --> 00:08:36,412
It's going to rain
and my feathers will get wet.

30
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,087
I'm going away.

31
00:08:38,435 --> 00:08:39,678
Where are you going?

32
00:08:39,825 --> 00:08:41,803
To Germany.

33
00:08:42,742 --> 00:08:45,205
Every day you go away to Germany.

34
00:08:45,348 --> 00:08:47,882
Alexander, we're late!

35
00:08:48,022 --> 00:08:49,124
Goodbye!

36
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:55,281
What's Germany like?

37
00:09:03,063 --> 00:09:06,462
In three minutes
Express 290 will be leaving

38
00:09:06,606 --> 00:09:13,333
for Germany on Track One.

39
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:42,765
Come on!

40
00:10:10,508 --> 00:10:11,681
We made it!

41
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:18,911
We made it!

42
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,171
Dear father,

43
00:11:22,064 --> 00:11:26,613
We are writing because we have
decided to come and find you.

44
00:11:27,483 --> 00:11:31,225
We have never seen you
and we miss you.

45
00:11:32,407 --> 00:11:35,593
We talk about you all the time.

46
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,036
Mummy will be upset
that we've gone.

47
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:43,979
Deep down inside we love her,
don't think we don't...

48
00:11:44,114 --> 00:11:46,956
but she doesn't understand anything...

49
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,722
We don't know what you look like...

50
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,049
Alexander says all sorts of things...

51
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:02,070
He dreams about you.
We miss you so much.

52
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,013
Sometimes on my way home
from school...

53
00:12:05,033 --> 00:12:08,124
I think I hear footsteps
behind me...

54
00:12:08,264 --> 00:12:11,213
your footsteps...

55
00:12:11,424 --> 00:12:16,588
and when I turn to look...
there is no one.

56
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,644
Then I feel very lonely.

57
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:24,657
We don't want to be
a burden to you...

58
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:30,244
we just want to get to know you
and then we'll go away again.

59
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,295
If you send us a reply...

60
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,484
Do it with the sound of the train...

61
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:45,111
tatan... tatan... tatan... tatan...

62
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,232
here I am...
I am waiting for you...

63
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,548
tatan... tatan...

64
00:13:06,885 --> 00:13:09,206
Tickets please!

65
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:33,234
Hey, tickets!

66
00:13:35,751 --> 00:13:38,249
Have you got tickets?

67
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:45,827
I don't know what you're going to do...
just sort things out.

68
00:15:22,363 --> 00:15:23,748
Sit down.

69
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:27,354
Where are you coming from?

70
00:15:34,938 --> 00:15:36,288
Orchomenos?

71
00:15:36,986 --> 00:15:39,828
Clear the track for the 290.

72
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:46,533
Announcing the arrival of Express 290.

73
00:15:47,581 --> 00:15:50,174
Yes, yes, yes.

74
00:15:59,044 --> 00:16:01,472
At least tell me
where you're going.

75
00:16:02,865 --> 00:16:05,955
Cat got your tongues.

76
00:16:08,353 --> 00:16:12,450
Hell, I'm not going to do
the cops' work for them.

77
00:16:17,732 --> 00:16:19,745
We're going to our uncle.

78
00:16:21,831 --> 00:16:23,975
So you've decided to speak.

79
00:16:26,728 --> 00:16:28,777
Good girl!

80
00:16:32,738 --> 00:16:34,159
Well?

81
00:17:52,561 --> 00:17:54,218
How did you get here?

82
00:17:56,556 --> 00:17:58,426
And is that Alexander?

83
00:18:00,481 --> 00:18:01,488
What's up?

84
00:18:01,628 --> 00:18:04,197
They were found without tickets
on the express for Germany.

85
00:18:04,337 --> 00:18:05,829
They said they were coming
to find you...

86
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:08,954
Difficult children.
I had to pry every word out of them.

87
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:13,157
Come here, come here and
tell me what's going on.

88
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,178
Fine then, everything's settled
you don't need me any more.

89
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,386
Just a moment!

90
00:18:34,176 --> 00:18:35,976
Look here...

91
00:18:37,718 --> 00:18:42,574
I can't get involved.
I'm not getting involved.

92
00:18:44,145 --> 00:18:50,422
- Aren't you their uncle?
- Yes... I am their mother's

93
00:18:50,571 --> 00:18:53,236
brother... but we've been
out of touch for years.

94
00:18:58,026 --> 00:19:04,304
I can't take the responsibility.
The whole thing's my sister's fault.

95
00:19:07,544 --> 00:19:11,121
Did she have to tell them that
their father's in Germany?

96
00:19:11,539 --> 00:19:13,480
What father? What Germany?

97
00:19:13,623 --> 00:19:15,174
She doesn't know
who their father is!

98
00:19:15,325 --> 00:19:18,511
There is no father...
there is no Germany.

99
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,838
The whole thing's a big lie.

100
00:19:25,815 --> 00:19:27,165
And for what reason?

101
00:19:28,142 --> 00:19:31,778
Because she didn't want to
tell them they're illegitimate.

102
00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:34,949
- And this is the result!
- But why Germany?

103
00:19:35,089 --> 00:19:36,119
How should I know?

104
00:19:36,271 --> 00:19:38,450
So that they have something
to dream about.

105
00:19:38,598 --> 00:19:41,475
Look here... don't get me
involved in this.

106
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,277
Notify their mother.

107
00:19:48,012 --> 00:19:51,162
You're lying! You're lying!

108
00:19:51,312 --> 00:19:55,268
Our father is in Germany!
You're lying!

109
00:19:55,410 --> 00:20:00,609
Our father is in Germany!
You're lying!

110
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:37,842
Wait here!

111
00:21:12,442 --> 00:21:13,934
It's snowing!

112
00:21:27,865 --> 00:21:29,487
It's snowing!

113
00:21:49,193 --> 00:21:50,472
It's snowing!

114
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,500
He tied the rope...

115
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:17,729
He tied the rope...

116
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,428
He tied the rope...

117
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,134
Dear father,

118
00:24:14,632 --> 00:24:17,582
How were we able to wait so long?

119
00:24:18,453 --> 00:24:22,302
We've been traveling like a leaf...
blowing in the wind.

120
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:26,261
What a strange world!

121
00:24:27,867 --> 00:24:32,131
Suitcases...
freezing railway stations...

122
00:24:32,278 --> 00:24:35,878
words and gestures
we don't understand...

123
00:24:36,064 --> 00:24:38,598
and the night which scares us!

124
00:24:40,684 --> 00:24:46,239
But we are happy.
We are moving on.

125
00:27:10,304 --> 00:27:12,104
Damn!

126
00:28:16,882 --> 00:28:18,433
He's dying.

127
00:29:15,794 --> 00:29:16,860
He's dead.

128
00:31:06,412 --> 00:31:07,999
Hello there!

129
00:31:11,241 --> 00:31:13,290
What are you doing
in this wilderness?

130
00:31:13,429 --> 00:31:15,016
The town's still a long way off.

131
00:31:20,515 --> 00:31:23,109
There's lots of room back there.

132
00:32:03,657 --> 00:32:05,351
I don't eat children.

133
00:33:04,064 --> 00:33:07,013
You haven't told me
where you're going.

134
00:33:11,671 --> 00:33:13,198
Far away.

135
00:33:14,241 --> 00:33:18,338
Okay, I'll drop you off in town.

136
00:33:28,656 --> 00:33:34,862
They're stage costumes.
And that one there's mine.

137
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:36,536
What do you do?

138
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:46,301
I make people laugh...

139
00:33:49,782 --> 00:33:51,368
and cry.

140
00:33:54,124 --> 00:33:56,303
D'you know how difficult that is?

141
00:33:58,084 --> 00:33:59,742
What d'you play?

142
00:34:08,575 --> 00:34:09,889
My part.

143
00:34:19,412 --> 00:34:21,697
Seven knocks on the stage...

144
00:34:23,754 --> 00:34:25,590
then three...

145
00:34:28,548 --> 00:34:30,277
and the curtain goes up

146
00:34:32,717 --> 00:34:35,488
The accordion player plays
the overture...

147
00:35:02,728 --> 00:35:04,385
and I enter.

148
00:35:08,112 --> 00:35:11,097
The day dawned and Pleiades
shone in the sky.

149
00:35:11,238 --> 00:35:12,825
What's Pleiades?

150
00:35:12,976 --> 00:35:18,175
It is the morning star...

151
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:21,683
the dawn star... which goes out
just before daybreak.

152
00:36:09,873 --> 00:36:13,058
Let her rest... you must have
walked a long way.

153
00:36:13,937 --> 00:36:16,673
Want to see something?
Come on!

154
00:36:42,247 --> 00:36:44,461
- D'you like it?
- Is it yours?

155
00:36:45,617 --> 00:36:47,523
There they are!
They're coming!

156
00:37:56,223 --> 00:37:56,945
What happened?

157
00:37:57,091 --> 00:37:58,263
Nothing...

158
00:37:58,411 --> 00:38:01,076
We couldn't get theatre...
Do something!

159
00:38:01,224 --> 00:38:02,574
Orestes,

160
00:38:03,621 --> 00:38:08,335
grandfather will die
if we don't find a theatre.

161
00:38:08,484 --> 00:38:11,397
Do something!
Okay, I'll go to the Pantheon.

162
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,933
I'll meet you back here, okay?

163
00:38:18,071 --> 00:38:19,243
Did you see them?

164
00:38:19,391 --> 00:38:24,211
- They're sad.
- Times have changed.

165
00:38:27,103 --> 00:38:33,143
Everything's changed.
And ravaged by time they wander

166
00:38:33,286 --> 00:38:37,691
stubbornly all over Greece...
always performing the same play.

167
00:38:45,895 --> 00:38:47,316
I've got something to do.

168
00:38:56,941 --> 00:38:58,706
Let her sleep...

169
00:38:59,512 --> 00:39:01,347
I'll be back.

170
00:39:03,158 --> 00:39:05,373
Is your name Orestes?

171
00:40:51,905 --> 00:40:53,846
A sandwich please...

172
00:40:53,989 --> 00:40:55,339
D'you have money?

173
00:40:55,483 --> 00:40:57,697
No, but I'm hungry.

174
00:40:58,157 --> 00:41:03,463
Yes, you're hungry, but you know...
to eat you need money!

175
00:41:03,784 --> 00:41:06,520
Even I pay when I'm hungry.

176
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:10,580
Yes, but I don't have
any money and I'm hungry.

177
00:41:10,836 --> 00:41:12,186
I understand.

178
00:41:14,691 --> 00:41:17,806
Listen, if you want to
earn money for your food...

179
00:41:17,957 --> 00:41:21,699
you can clear all the tables
you see in here...

180
00:41:21,847 --> 00:41:25,660
you'll work a little and then
you'll eat. Agreed?

181
00:41:44,495 --> 00:41:45,524
All of them?

182
00:41:46,995 --> 00:41:48,346
Clear them up.

183
00:43:14,688 --> 00:43:17,258
Hey, what's going on here?

184
00:44:55,253 --> 00:44:56,781
Seagull!

185
00:44:58,518 --> 00:45:00,353
Seagull!

186
00:45:02,235 --> 00:45:04,035
Seagull!

187
00:45:07,133 --> 00:45:08,269
Where have you been?

188
00:45:17,866 --> 00:45:20,080
It's flying away. It didn't see me.

189
00:45:20,645 --> 00:45:22,930
Where have you been so long?

190
00:45:23,528 --> 00:45:27,555
See... I earned it for you...
I worked.

191
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,514
You're funny kids, you know that?

192
00:46:17,248 --> 00:46:20,303
It's as if you don't care
about time going by...

193
00:46:20,443 --> 00:46:23,534
and yet I know that you are
in a hurry to leave.

194
00:46:24,577 --> 00:46:30,262
It's as if you're going nowhere...
and yet you're going somewhere.

195
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:32,177
You do know where you're going,
don't you?

196
00:46:32,323 --> 00:46:34,467
You're funny too.

197
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:37,838
Me?

198
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:42,845
I'm a snail slithering away
into nothingness...

199
00:46:43,022 --> 00:46:44,716
I don't know where I'm going.

200
00:46:46,808 --> 00:46:49,271
Once I thought I knew.

201
00:46:51,081 --> 00:46:54,409
Where am I going?

202
00:46:57,089 --> 00:46:59,517
The only thing I know for sure
is that in a few days...

203
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:01,282
I'll be going into the army...
to do my military service.

204
00:47:16,299 --> 00:47:17,613
What is it?

205
00:47:41,691 --> 00:47:43,562
Can't see anything.

206
00:47:44,713 --> 00:47:46,407
Look carefully.

207
00:47:48,534 --> 00:47:50,085
Nothing.

208
00:47:51,764 --> 00:47:53,150
Can't you see?

209
00:47:54,022 --> 00:48:03,047
Behind the mist... in the distance...
can't you see a tree?

210
00:48:03,575 --> 00:48:05,339
No.

211
00:48:07,291 --> 00:48:10,276
Me neither. I was kidding.

212
00:48:11,251 --> 00:48:13,750
- Will you give it to me?
- It's yours.

213
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:52,620
Where are we?

214
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:09,486
Good morning!

215
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:22,300
Good morning!

216
00:49:27,393 --> 00:49:33,576
In the meantime the Turks
took Afion Karahisar...

217
00:49:33,714 --> 00:49:35,241
It was in August of l922.

218
00:49:35,682 --> 00:49:37,411
After the Germans left...
in the autumn of l944...

219
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:41,585
the front began to break...
...the British marched into Athens...

220
00:49:41,726 --> 00:49:44,295
The first government of
National Unity was formed.

221
00:49:44,435 --> 00:49:48,462
There were rallies... enthusiasm.

222
00:49:48,603 --> 00:49:52,452
Because everyone had
believed in the liberation...

223
00:49:52,599 --> 00:49:57,668
and in alliances
and in the Allies.

224
00:49:57,809 --> 00:50:02,037
I'm your partner

225
00:50:03,748 --> 00:50:07,112
Come child...
let me comb your hair...

226
00:50:08,056 --> 00:50:12,213
That's no way for the hair of
a pretty child like you to look.

227
00:50:14,483 --> 00:50:17,811
Who'll do the train?

228
00:50:18,685 --> 00:50:22,985
...and seeing the Nazi collaborators...

229
00:50:23,131 --> 00:50:26,009
free and rearmed by the British...

230
00:50:26,154 --> 00:50:28,688
We felt betrayed.

231
00:50:29,106 --> 00:50:32,399
We were notified to
stage a demonstration.

232
00:50:32,545 --> 00:50:37,164
I was arrested at the end of l947.

233
00:50:38,763 --> 00:50:42,470
After the Germans left...
in the autumn of l944...

234
00:50:42,619 --> 00:50:45,947
the British marched into Athens.

235
00:50:46,092 --> 00:50:49,182
The first government of
National Unity was formed.

236
00:50:49,322 --> 00:50:52,543
There were rallies.
There was enthusiasm.

237
00:50:52,692 --> 00:50:56,813
Because everyone believed in
alliances and in the Allies.

238
00:50:56,964 --> 00:50:59,108
I keep forgetting the beginning.

239
00:50:59,257 --> 00:51:00,986
Let's figure out
how must we lost

240
00:51:01,133 --> 00:51:07,895
...events intervened, sounds,

241
00:51:08,045 --> 00:51:10,852
...ships intervened
from the raging open sea...

242
00:51:10,998 --> 00:51:14,575
People are calling out...
my breast...

243
00:51:14,714 --> 00:51:16,585
the factories...

244
00:51:16,938 --> 00:51:18,879
October 1917.

245
00:51:19,022 --> 00:51:21,071
October '17. l936...

246
00:51:21,210 --> 00:51:23,839
December 1944.

247
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:26,830
For this I will keep on
wearing the rags I wore...

248
00:51:26,976 --> 00:51:29,605
when the French revolution bore me...
when you bore me

249
00:51:29,755 --> 00:51:32,870
Mother Spain...

250
00:51:33,021 --> 00:51:35,757
a dark conspirator.

251
00:51:35,903 --> 00:51:37,182
Here we go

252
00:52:01,122 --> 00:52:04,521
The play that we are going to
perform for you tonight...

253
00:52:04,665 --> 00:52:07,780
is Spyridon Peresiades'
immortal love story...

254
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:12,122
Golfo, the Shepherdess...

255
00:52:12,272 --> 00:52:15,292
with a select company
of famous actors,

256
00:52:15,433 --> 00:52:17,647
young and not so young.
Golfo's tragic love...

257
00:52:17,795 --> 00:52:21,916
will touch the depths of
your heart... and all...

258
00:52:26,653 --> 00:52:29,874
I'm sorry you people...
it's out of the question.

259
00:52:30,022 --> 00:52:33,942
They want the auditorium for
a dance and paying big money.

260
00:52:34,086 --> 00:52:36,928
This era is really terrible

261
00:52:37,074 --> 00:52:39,916
We've worked together
for so many years, but...

262
00:52:40,582 --> 00:52:44,017
I'm sorry!

263
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:50,820
Orestes, take me to town.

264
00:52:51,177 --> 00:52:53,675
Let's go find some place else

265
00:54:45,089 --> 00:54:49,210
I dreamt of him again last night.

266
00:55:23,042 --> 00:55:24,664
I can't walk any further

267
00:56:19,002 --> 00:56:19,973
Where are you going?

268
00:56:20,114 --> 00:56:21,535
Up north.

269
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:23,112
Come on!

270
00:57:01,484 --> 00:57:02,656
Are you hungry?

271
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:22,981
For three...

272
00:57:29,864 --> 00:57:31,699
and wine, honey.

273
00:57:57,930 --> 00:57:59,660
Are you going very far north?

274
00:58:00,362 --> 00:58:01,534
Why?

275
00:58:03,315 --> 00:58:04,558
I've come!

276
00:58:05,919 --> 00:58:07,305
Are you new?

277
00:58:08,525 --> 00:58:10,076
Can't you tell?

278
00:58:18,494 --> 00:58:20,886
Where are you going?

279
00:58:21,829 --> 00:58:25,536
- Up north.
- Up north where?

280
00:58:25,685 --> 00:58:27,342
I've come again.

281
00:58:28,637 --> 00:58:30,650
I'm coming too.

282
00:58:35,063 --> 00:58:36,650
Dude

283
00:58:40,586 --> 00:58:42,800
The garden is private.

284
00:58:44,964 --> 00:58:47,072
Pay attention to the gladiolus!

285
00:58:49,166 --> 00:58:50,824
Did you hear me?

286
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:03,779
I'm busy anyway

287
00:59:26,182 --> 00:59:27,733
Got it

288
00:59:44,453 --> 00:59:46,218
Take them with you.

289
01:01:17,824 --> 01:01:19,659
I'm going in the back
to get a little sleep.

290
01:02:21,669 --> 01:02:23,125
Come here a minute.

291
01:02:26,219 --> 01:02:28,019
Come with me I'm telling you.

292
01:03:45,813 --> 01:03:47,164
Voula!

293
01:03:59,681 --> 01:04:01,338
Voula!

294
01:04:04,163 --> 01:04:05,857
Voula!

295
01:04:08,971 --> 01:04:10,498
Voula!

296
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:03,982
Dear father,

297
01:08:05,413 --> 01:08:07,911
How far away you are!

298
01:08:09,650 --> 01:08:15,797
Alexander says that in his dream
you seemed very close...

299
01:08:18,334 --> 01:08:22,456
if he stretched out his hand
he would have touched you.

300
01:08:29,241 --> 01:08:32,083
We are traveling continually.

301
01:08:33,063 --> 01:08:35,171
Everything goes by so fast...

302
01:08:36,015 --> 01:08:37,921
cities...

303
01:08:38,412 --> 01:08:40,555
people...

304
01:08:42,094 --> 01:08:45,801
but sometimes we get so tired...

305
01:08:46,192 --> 01:08:48,265
too tired to think about you.

306
01:08:49,180 --> 01:08:54,320
We lose our orientation.

307
01:08:54,669 --> 01:08:56,291
Then we get lost.

308
01:08:57,933 --> 01:09:00,361
Alexander has grown up a lot.

309
01:09:00,504 --> 01:09:02,517
He has become very serious.

310
01:09:03,283 --> 01:09:05,533
He gets dressed all by himself.

311
01:09:05,992 --> 01:09:09,462
He says things you wouldn't expect...

312
01:09:10,126 --> 01:09:16,818
I have been very ill the past few days.
I was burning up...

313
01:09:17,421 --> 01:09:20,333
now I'm slowly getting better.

314
01:09:21,137 --> 01:09:26,443
But it's such a long way to Germany!

315
01:09:47,051 --> 01:09:51,599
Yesterday I even thought
we should give it up...

316
01:09:52,816 --> 01:09:55,871
What is the use of carrying on...

317
01:09:56,012 --> 01:09:58,712
that we shall never get there.

318
01:09:59,242 --> 01:10:05,141
Then Alexander got mad...
the way grown-ups get mad...

319
01:10:05,287 --> 01:10:07,915
and he told me I was betraying him.

320
01:10:08,517 --> 01:10:10,044
I was ashamed.

321
01:10:17,501 --> 01:10:19,231
D'you miss Mummy?

322
01:10:42,963 --> 01:10:45,876
We each write to you the same things

323
01:10:46,714 --> 01:10:50,184
and we both fall silent
before each other...

324
01:10:50,813 --> 01:10:53,927
looking at the same world...

325
01:10:55,259 --> 01:11:02,377
the light... and the darkness... and you.

326
01:15:00,266 --> 01:15:02,693
That's it! I know it!

327
01:15:22,809 --> 01:15:24,230
We were on the train...

328
01:15:24,963 --> 01:15:29,997
and the train stopped...
and the police came on...

329
01:15:30,138 --> 01:15:33,608
and we ran all the way here...
and here we found more policemen.

330
01:15:33,751 --> 01:15:36,901
You must help us get away.

331
01:16:25,148 --> 01:16:26,699
We got away!

332
01:16:26,850 --> 01:16:28,271
The sea!

333
01:16:45,572 --> 01:16:48,273
Didn't I say you were funny kids?

334
01:16:59,293 --> 01:17:03,450
And now hold tight.
We're taking off!

335
01:17:24,338 --> 01:17:25,616
Are you scared?

336
01:17:25,762 --> 01:17:27,870
No...

337
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:31,075
- I don't want it ever to end.
- What?

338
01:17:31,216 --> 01:17:32,672
This.

339
01:18:04,076 --> 01:18:06,220
If it was summer we could swim.

340
01:18:06,369 --> 01:18:08,026
Yeah

341
01:18:09,599 --> 01:18:10,842
I'm thirsty...

342
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:12,470
Come on!

343
01:18:24,570 --> 01:18:28,277
A beer and two orange drinks.

344
01:18:54,270 --> 01:18:56,733
Where are we going afterwards?

345
01:18:56,875 --> 01:19:00,096
To Thessaloniki, remember?

346
01:19:00,244 --> 01:19:03,750
Didn't I tell you that night...
that in a few days...

347
01:19:03,891 --> 01:19:07,491
I would leave the company
and go into the army?

348
01:19:07,643 --> 01:19:09,621
How about you?

349
01:19:10,353 --> 01:19:14,996
I'm not asking.
I realize I mustn't ask.

350
01:19:15,180 --> 01:19:16,802
The only thing you gave me
to understand...

351
01:19:16,952 --> 01:19:19,131
is that you must
catch a train at all costs.

352
01:19:29,943 --> 01:19:31,637
Shall we dance?

353
01:19:35,154 --> 01:19:37,297
I don't know how to dance.

354
01:19:43,282 --> 01:19:44,869
I'll show you.

355
01:21:29,227 --> 01:21:31,098
Let's leave her alone...

356
01:21:32,458 --> 01:21:36,342
Today's she's discovered
something very great!

357
01:21:36,591 --> 01:21:38,497
We must leave her alone.

358
01:22:36,598 --> 01:22:40,447
Our journey ends here. <br />
At least mine does.

359
01:22:51,291 --> 01:22:52,748
Don't leave go yet!

360
01:22:56,711 --> 01:23:00,418
What?
Aren't you leaving?

361
01:23:02,790 --> 01:23:04,175
Not yet.

362
01:23:08,452 --> 01:23:11,080
Aren't you catching the train?

363
01:23:12,238 --> 01:23:15,672
In the evening.
Not yet.

364
01:23:29,293 --> 01:23:34,528
So we don't have to leave
until evening

365
01:23:41,659 --> 01:23:44,466
I'm insane, too
for I feel excited

366
01:23:53,157 --> 01:23:54,329
Let's go

367
01:24:07,225 --> 01:24:08,503
Let's go

368
01:24:48,733 --> 01:24:50,390
What are you doing?

369
01:24:55,818 --> 01:24:57,547
Have you gone mad?

370
01:24:58,388 --> 01:25:00,981
You're selling off the costumes?

371
01:25:01,966 --> 01:25:03,660
Who decided it?

372
01:25:11,345 --> 01:25:13,394
Where's grandfather?

373
01:25:15,479 --> 01:25:20,477
He's not well... understand?
He doesn't want to come out.

374
01:25:29,130 --> 01:25:30,444
These are the ones.

375
01:25:41,809 --> 01:25:44,474
Some day I'll open my mouth...

376
01:25:44,622 --> 01:25:52,048
the gardens will fill with waterfalls...
in the same courtyards... the arsenals.

377
01:26:38,463 --> 01:26:40,927
I don't like funerals.

378
01:26:43,256 --> 01:26:44,535
Goodbye.

379
01:26:57,047 --> 01:26:58,504
'Bye.

380
01:35:48,997 --> 01:35:55,202
If I were to shout,
who would hear me...

381
01:35:55,353 --> 01:35:58,303
out of the armies of angels?

382
01:38:31,846 --> 01:38:33,196
D'you want it?

383
01:38:42,753 --> 01:38:44,031
How much?

384
01:38:46,644 --> 01:38:48,266
How much are you giving?

385
01:38:58,872 --> 01:39:00,920
It makes me sick to have to sell it.

386
01:39:33,885 --> 01:39:34,914
Okay.

387
01:39:38,123 --> 01:39:39,887
Got a cigarette?

388
01:39:54,206 --> 01:39:58,197
I'll bring it round tomorrow.
Tonight I need it.

389
01:40:12,650 --> 01:40:17,056
What we just did... is what we
in the theatre call the final act.

390
01:40:18,521 --> 01:40:20,735
Shall we go have something to drink?

391
01:40:27,448 --> 01:40:29,841
Didn't you ask for an orange drink?

392
01:40:36,340 --> 01:40:38,662
What's taking him so long?

393
01:40:46,866 --> 01:40:48,488
You stay here.

394
01:43:24,119 --> 01:43:25,469
Is he asleep?

395
01:43:30,718 --> 01:43:32,304
What's the matter with you?

396
01:43:33,184 --> 01:43:34,321
Nothing.

397
01:43:37,562 --> 01:43:38,011
Get some rest.

398
01:43:38,152 --> 01:43:39,644
I'll be back.

399
01:44:54,916 --> 01:44:56,680
You forgot your bag.

400
01:45:20,828 --> 01:45:22,320
You're going to miss the train.

401
01:45:25,483 --> 01:45:27,732
I wouldn't like us to part like this

402
01:45:28,366 --> 01:45:31,244
To hell with everything else.
I don't care.

403
01:45:32,709 --> 01:45:35,586
I wouldn't like us
to part like this...

404
01:45:36,077 --> 01:45:38,813
We had agreed I was to
take you to the railway station.

405
01:45:38,961 --> 01:45:41,838
I wouldn't like us to part like this.

406
01:46:55,067 --> 01:46:59,094
Little loner, that's the way
it is the first time...

407
01:47:06,458 --> 01:47:09,751
that's the way it is the first time...

408
01:47:13,370 --> 01:47:18,226
your heart beats
so you think it will break.

409
01:47:18,372 --> 01:47:21,949
That's the way it is
the first time, little loner.

410
01:47:24,173 --> 01:47:25,760
Your feet tremble...

411
01:47:31,954 --> 01:47:34,098
you want to die...

412
01:50:03,612 --> 01:50:06,489
How much does the ticket
for the border cost?

413
01:50:12,087 --> 01:50:14,716
We'll be expelled again

414
01:50:14,935 --> 01:50:16,664
What's the border?

415
01:50:17,749 --> 01:50:19,478
Money's not enough

416
01:50:34,874 --> 01:50:38,025
When's the last train?

417
01:51:53,968 --> 01:51:57,024
Will you let me have 385 drachmas?

418
01:55:02,108 --> 01:55:03,386
What's your name?

419
01:55:11,660 --> 01:55:14,610
I've said something dumb again.

420
01:56:33,359 --> 01:56:42,491
Your attention please! Passengers
for Germany are kindly requested...

421
01:56:45,796 --> 01:56:55,069
to have their passports ready
for the border inspection.

422
01:58:06,346 --> 01:58:11,274
Beyond the river lies Germany.

423
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:52,906
A boat!

424
01:59:27,183 --> 01:59:28,947
Are you afraid?

425
01:59:29,093 --> 01:59:32,243
No, I'm not afraid.

426
02:00:12,304 --> 02:00:13,477
Stop

427
02:00:46,207 --> 02:00:48,492
Wake up, it's light.

428
02:00:48,709 --> 02:00:50,817
We're in Germany!

429
02:01:30,530 --> 02:01:32,508
I'm afraid.

430
02:01:33,448 --> 02:01:36,504
Don't be afraid.
I'll tell you the story.

431
02:01:43,139 --> 02:01:47,853
In the beginning was the darkness...

432
02:01:51,407 --> 02:01:53,835
in the beginning was the darkness...

433
02:02:04,849 --> 02:02:06,993
and then there was light.
