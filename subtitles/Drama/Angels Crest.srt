1
00:00:07,674 --> 00:00:08,800
Whoa, look at Rachel's balloon.

2
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,385
Look at that balloon.

3
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:12,137
All right, she's gonna let it go on three.

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:16,600
One, two, three.

5
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,102
Oh, I got attacked by a balloon.

6
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:24,691
What's up with that?

7
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:30,739
Hey, Nate, you got a cake nose!

8
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,823
Dadda?

9
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:15,993
Daddy, wake up.

10
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,787
I wet my bed.

11
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:24,835
Okay.

12
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,173
Okay.

13
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:33,844
It's all right.

14
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,972
There we go.

15
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:40,559
Okay.

16
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:43,770
Is that okay?

17
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,440
Go back to sleep.

18
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:52,487
It's bed time, okay?

19
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,497
Is Dadda awake?

20
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:08,211
No, Dadda not awake.

21
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,589
Dadda, there's snow.

22
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:13,925
- Snow?
- Come see!

23
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,470
- Where?
- Over there.

24
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:20,724
Is it getting you?

25
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,893
Snow.

26
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,145
It's getting snow all over.

27
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,480
Do that again.

28
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,939
- Hey, buddy.
- Yeah.

29
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,232
- You wanna go outside?
- Yeah.

30
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:30,734
Want to build a snowman?

31
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,903
- Yeah.
- Then let's go.

32
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,238
Seven...

33
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,074
11...

34
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,827
aren't ya?

35
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,705
Who's my little guy? All right, I got you. Two arm.

36
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:47,501
Love you.

37
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,252
- Hey, you know what?
- What?

38
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,088
I think Charlie might be a little cold in the snow.

39
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,257
- Should we leave Charlie behind?
- Yeah.

40
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,592
- Bye, Charlie.
- Bye, Charlie.

41
00:02:55,634 --> 00:02:56,760
Bye-bye, Charlie.

42
00:02:56,843 --> 00:03:02,391
- Yeah.
- Bye-bye, Charlie.

43
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,434
- Are we gonna make a snowman?
- Yeah.

44
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:05,769
- Are we gonna go sledding?
- Yeah.

45
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,062
Oh, it's really cold, Nate.

46
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,980
Are you gonna sit beside me?

47
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,066
I can't. Daddy's gotta drive.

48
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:17,114
Let's put your little arm through. There.

49
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,837
Is Charlie okay?

50
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,884
I'm sure Charlie's just fine.

51
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,761
Are you sleeping?

52
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:43,515
You wake me up, and now you're going to sleep?

53
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,393
Look, there's Angie.

54
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:52,441
Hey, Ethan.

55
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,406
Get your blanket, here.

56
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,451
There you go.

57
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,286
What do we want for dinner tonight, huh?

58
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:10,333
Pizza.

59
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:24,556
Look at that huge mountain.

60
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,975
There's a dump truck.

61
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:32,981
Vroom, vroom!

62
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:55,712
Look at that.

63
00:04:55,754 --> 00:05:00,717
What do you think, champ?

64
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:06,765
Nate, hey. Buddy, wake up.

65
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:47,365
Shit.

66
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:55,206
Nate.

67
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:08,386
Nate!

68
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,847
Nate!

69
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:16,895
Come on, buddy! Let's go!

70
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:31,451
Nate!

71
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,371
Can I get you anything else, Frank?

72
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,957
No, I'm just gonna sit here and avoid the weather.

73
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,750
Don't blame you a bit. Paul?

74
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,251
Tabasco.

75
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:44,381
How could I forget?

76
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:50,428
Angie's, you got her.

77
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,698
I'm late for work again.

78
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,200
It's the second time this week.

79
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,994
We need to keep last night to ourselves.

80
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:17,580
You think?

81
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,583
Jane's gonna kill me.

82
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:26,589
Hmm.

83
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,925
Hey, maybe we should keep this
morning to ourselves as well.

84
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,720
I'm not gonna fall for that, Rusty.

85
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,430
Come here.

86
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:39,477
Come here.

87
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:43,064
Cindy!

88
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,441
- Cindy.
- What?

89
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,568
Maybe you should put some panties on first.

90
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,903
Oh, shit.

91
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:54,951
- Cindy, it's Angie.
- I'm coming.

92
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,578
Hey, Angie.

93
00:08:56,661 --> 00:09:02,667
Cindy, I need you to get dressed.

94
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,178
How far did you track that deer?

95
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,721
100 yards, maybe half a mile...

96
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,973
- I don't know.
- Which direction?

97
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,476
North. Northeast, towards the ravine.

98
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,478
And how long were you gone?

99
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,271
10 minutes, maybe.

100
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:24,773
Maybe?

101
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:27,525
No more than 20.

102
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,862
I want the dogs all over that trail, go.

103
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,823
Now, Charlie!

104
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:35,450
Hey, heard over the radio.

105
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,535
Gotta talk to Bill. Where's Rusty?

106
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:43,541
Rusty... haven't seen him since Trevor's last night.

107
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,295
Come on. Come on.

108
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:53,301
Fuck me. Come on.

109
00:09:55,553 --> 00:10:01,518
Come back to Daddy now.

110
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,818
I guess I'm not going in to work.

111
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:12,195
Got a good excuse now.

112
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,197
This radio work?

113
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,784
Yeah, sure.

114
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,619
♪ If you're happy and you know it ♪

115
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,704
♪ Then your face will surely show it ♪

116
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:26,584

117
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:31,506
Nate.

118
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:35,176
Nate!

119
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,220
- Hey, Rusty.
- Hey, Charlie.

120
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,973
- What's going on? Where's Ethan?
- He's up in the woods.

121
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,225
- Okay, where? What direction?
- No, no, no, no, no.

122
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,228
I need you to check in right there, right now. Go.

123
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,064
All right. You fucking believe this?

124
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:51,568
- Rusty.
- Hey, Bill.

125
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,695
Nate!

126
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:57,907
I need some help!

127
00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:00,034
Fucking...

128
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:03,580
- Ethan.
- Where were you?

129
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,999
Fuck, man, I didn't have my phone on.

130
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,500
Where you heading?

131
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:09,919
Northeast part of the trail, by the old campsite.

132
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:11,713
I already hit it once. Mabe I missed something.

133
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,506
Okay, I'll head south. We'll meet back here

134
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:15,216
- in two hours, okay?
- Yeah.

135
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:16,926
Hey. Cindy?

136
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:22,974
Angie's with her.

137
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:26,728
How old's Rosie now?

138
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:31,024
Um, she's coming up on three and a half.

139
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,775
She's a Pisces, right?

140
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:38,781
Pisces? No. She's a Libra.

141
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:47,290
Natey!

142
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:53,338
Natey!

143
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,858
Excuse me, ma'am.

144
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,319
Volunteers can report to Officer Parks right over here.

145
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,154
Okay, we're not volunteers.

146
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:20,782
- This is Cindy Mills.
- You know, the mother.

147
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,618
Oh, would you like some coffee or something?

148
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,371
Coffee? I don't want coffee. I want to talk to Ethan.

149
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,248
We should talk to Bill first, find out what's going on.

150
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,832
Where is he?

151
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,085
You...

152
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,797
son of a bitch!

153
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,009
- You motherfucking son of a bitch.
- Cindy.

154
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:42,178
- You went and fucking lost him?
- Cindy, calm down.

155
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,764
- All right, look...
- No, I don't want to calm down!

156
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:48,977
- I wanna know where my son is!
- We all do!

157
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,604
- Don't make this about you, Cindy.
- If he's dead...

158
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,273
Now don't fucking...

159
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,024
If he's dead, I will kill you.

160
00:12:55,066 --> 00:12:57,694
If he's that, I'll save you the trouble.

161
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:01,197
Get her out of here please.

162
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:06,744
Oh, God.

163
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,371
Nate?

164
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:14,419
Nate!

165
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,383
Nate!

166
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:24,554
Why is nobody screaming his name?

167
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,389
Back to work.

168
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,559
- I mean, he's gone, right?
- We don't know that yet.

169
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:33,062
I can take myself.

170
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:34,564
How many rangers do we have out here?

171
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,065
We have enough. We have all we can manage.

172
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:37,859
We need to get more people out here.

173
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,861
Go home and put on a warmer coat.

174
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:44,282
When it gets dark, he won't survive it.

175
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,243
We know that, Jane. We're doing everything we can.

176
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:49,704
Just... just hang tight.

177
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,414
- Nate!
- Tom.

178
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:57,420
Tom, I need a report on grid four.

179
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:25,031
Here, drop me here.

180
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,869
Oh, please, God. Please, please, please.

181
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:17,125
Please, please, God, don't take him away from me.

182
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,586
Please.

183
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:24,173
Come on, let's go.

184
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,426
Ethan.

185
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,010
- Ethan, I'm so sorry.
- What's going on?

186
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,263
- Bill says it's getting dark.
- What the hell is going on?

187
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:34,517
- So he thinks...
- What, everyone's leaving now?

188
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,311
Hey. What's going on?

189
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,855
You're sending people home now?

190
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,315
I'm sorry, Ethan, we just can't
keep this up in the dark.

191
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,192
What the fuck? My son is still out there.

192
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:45,570
I know that, but it's just not safe

193
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,071
for the search teams any more.

194
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,365
Not safe for the search teams? He's three years old.

195
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:50,867
I can't risk anyone else.

196
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,161
Fuck your risk. Nobody goes home.

197
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,705
You, stop. We're not shutting down.

198
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,206
Put the tent... put the stuff down,

199
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,708
and put the tent back up.

200
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,669
Pack it up, Charlie.

201
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,005
You listen to me, you put the fucking tent back up.

202
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,382
- Ethan! Ethan.
- What?

203
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:08,217
Gotta let Bill do his job.

204
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,470
Rusty, Bill's job is to help me find Nate

205
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,889
while there's still time.

206
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:16,225
And there's still time, right?

207
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:19,479
- Right?
- Yes.

208
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,689
Yes, Ethan, there's still time.

209
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,484
Now, I gotta send these other people home,

210
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:28,237
but... but I'm staying,

211
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:30,156
and we're gonna take turns searching,

212
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:31,657
and we're gonna search all night.

213
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,993
That's right.

214
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,329
Okay? Ethan?

215
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:42,376
Yeah. Yeah.

216
00:16:56,265 --> 00:17:00,686
You really think those shoes are the best choice?

217
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:06,734
I wasn't really thinking.

218
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:15,117
- Hey.
- What?

219
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,347
I'm getting you all wet.

220
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,266
Always.

221
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,850
That's not what I meant.

222
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:45,898
Mmm, then that's too bad.

223
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,152
You should have seen Ethan, Rox.

224
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:54,448
- He was devastated.
- Yeah, well.

225
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:58,160
- What?
- He lost his kid.

226
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,830
It's a natural reaction in the scheme of things.

227
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:04,250
- He should feel devastated.
- Should?

228
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,460
What do you want me to say, Jane?

229
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,713
Just say what you think, Rox. You always do.

230
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,132
Fine. Ethan shouldn't have left Nate in the truck.

231
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,675
It was stupid and careless,

232
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,552
and what the fuck was he thinking?

233
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,179
It's his own fault.

234
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,015
You could have some compassion.

235
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:25,021
I do. I do have compassion, a truckload of it, for Nate.

236
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:45,708
That'll be $4.86.

237
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:51,505
Shit.

238
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,049
It's basic.

239
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:57,553
You think medium would taste better?

240
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,305
- Hey.
- Yeah?

241
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,182
You still buddies with Ethan?

242
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,392
Yeah. So?

243
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:06,354
Yeah, well, he owes me.

244
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,564
Wanna spot me some beer?

245
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,608
She'll probably give you a blowjob for it, man.

246
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:16,697
I can fucking hear you!

247
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:27,416
You're a good man.

248
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:48,938
Come on, Nate. Nate.

249
00:19:54,151 --> 00:20:00,116
All right.

250
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,877
Come on, Nate.

251
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:17,925
Come on.

252
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:37,004
Nate!

253
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,361
Hey, hey.

254
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,946
Nate, it's Daddy.

255
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,447
Hey, hey.

256
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:09,495
Hey.

257
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,611
Take care, Brian.

258
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,363
- You, too.
- See you, man.

259
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,531
District attorney Jack Craft will be holding

260
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,952
a press conference later this morning in Angels Crest.

261
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,871
It's expected that Mr. Craft will address the case

262
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:17,873
of three-year-old Nathan Denton,

263
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:20,292
who was found frozen to death last week

264
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:26,298
after his father Ethan Denton had left him in the truck.

265
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:55,035
I told them not to let anyone in yet, but... you okay?

266
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:57,287
Yeah. It's smaller than I remember.

267
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,165
- What?
- The coffin.

268
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,251
- You went to the funeral?
- No. I'll... I'll be fine.

269
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,752
Maybe we should just postpone.

270
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:05,254
No, no, no. How much time do we have?

271
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:11,260
- 10 minutes.
- 10 minutes.

272
00:25:11,969 --> 00:25:14,263
- Jack.
- Yes.

273
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,598
District Attorney, any comment on the accusations?

274
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,268
Mr. Craft, can you separate this
case from your own past?

275
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,437
The state is filing charges against Ethan Denton

276
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,772
for the death of his son Nathan Denton.

277
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:26,108
Now, we are not claiming that Ethan Denton

278
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,943
deliberately killed his son.

279
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:30,404
However, his decision to leave the boy

280
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,865
alone in a truck during a blizzard

281
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,409
directly led to his death, and therefore constitutes

282
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,036
an act of criminal negligence.

283
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:39,455
Jack, are you the right man to be prosecuting?

284
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,750
- Thank you.
- Jack, Jack, without being personal...

285
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:48,797
Jack, any correlation between this case...

286
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:04,813
I'm so sorry.

287
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:14,740
Ethan, we need to talk.

288
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:20,788
Okay.

289
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,462
You keep in mind that I have never

290
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:33,342
hated my job more than I do right now.

291
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:37,763
- Okay.
- I gotta take you in.

292
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:41,016
For what?

293
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:47,022
Now, you'll be able to get a lawyer.

294
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,944
Right now?

295
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:57,991
- Right now.
- Okay. Okay.

296
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:10,671
- Did you see Bill, Angie?
- Yeah.

297
00:27:10,754 --> 00:27:13,215
Has everybody lost their minds completely?

298
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,259
- It was an accident.
- Calm down, Jane.

299
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,344
- Nobody's saying it wasn't.
- Ethan is a great kid.

300
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:20,222
Why am I the only person who's angry about this?

301
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,766
He just should have taken better care is all.

302
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:25,018
Hey, sweetheart.

303
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:31,024
I'm so sorry Mommy took such a long time.

304
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:50,836
♪ I wish I had a dime ♪

305
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:56,884
♪ For every bad time... ♪

306
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:15,152
Hi. I'm Jane Childs. I don't believe we've met.

307
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,529
I'm Joanne Mills.

308
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:21,450
It's nice to meet you. Are you a friend of...

309
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,619
I'm Cindy's mother.

310
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,622
Oh, oh. I didn't realize Cindy had...

311
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:30,250
I mean, of course I realized she
had a mother, but I just...

312
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:33,629
It's so good to meet you. It's so good you're here.

313
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,130
For Cindy.

314
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:37,090
Can I get you anything?

315
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:43,138
Do you know where Cindy is?

316
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:50,479
What's that?

317
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,439
It's medicine.

318
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:56,193
You have a tummy ache?

319
00:28:56,276 --> 00:29:00,989
Yeah, something like that.

320
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:02,824
So, you gonna go to the bathroom or what?

321
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:07,412
- I know how to go myself.
- Good for you.

322
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,414
I left Paul Jr. In the car once overnight

323
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,916
when he was about Nate's age.

324
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,542
Really?

325
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,169
Crying like a banshee the next morning,

326
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:16,338
but no worse for the wear.

327
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:19,174
- Never told Donna.
- Smart.

328
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:21,009
Of course, it was summertime.

329
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:22,844
Wouldn't have left him out there in the winter.

330
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:25,555
Yeah, so long as it was summertime.

331
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,933
You poor thing. What you must be going through...

332
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,476
I can just imagine.

333
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,228
But you rest assured,

334
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:35,357
Nate is in a better place.

335
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,985
Cindy, Cindy. I'm very sorry.

336
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,403
- She's just not herself.
- Oh, God!

337
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:45,450
Sit down.

338
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,336
You came, huh?

339
00:29:56,378 --> 00:30:02,384
I missed the funeral because
you gave me the wrong time.

340
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:11,935
You have very nice friends here.

341
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:15,647
The woman sewing coffee, she introduced herself.

342
00:30:15,689 --> 00:30:18,692
She was very nice.

343
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,235
Jane?

344
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:25,073
- Yes, Jane.
- She's a dyke.

345
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:26,992
Jane says we need some more napkins.

346
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:32,748
I'm getting them. I'm getting them.

347
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,666
Hey, hey, whoa.

348
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:36,585
I'll help, okay? It's cool.

349
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,879
It's not cool.

350
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:42,299
I've been trying to call Ethan's dad
for days, leaving messages,

351
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,926
and I just don't understand why he's not here.

352
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,595
Ethan needs someone.

353
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,513
No, Ethan doesn't need his dad right now.

354
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:51,725
- How do you know?
- I know Ethan.

355
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,728
Look, maybe it's you that needs someone.

356
00:30:54,811 --> 00:31:00,776
All right.

357
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:20,837
What?

358
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:26,885
I've gotta go.

359
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:31,223
Rose?

360
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,724
Rosie?

361
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:34,643
Guess what.

362
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,812
I washed my hands.

363
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,398
Good, baby. Good, sweetheart.

364
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,358
Oh.

365
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:43,235
Hey, what's this?

366
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,320
What's this you're wearing?

367
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:47,697
I thought it was a wedding.

368
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,908
Oh.

369
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,994
Yeah, baby, it's...

370
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:59,042
it's not a wedding.

371
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:27,571
You still play ball?

372
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:31,199
That's too bad. You were good.

373
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:33,660
Oh, thanks, man.

374
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:36,288
We got a softball league.

375
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,707
Play against the fire department.

376
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,252
It's not real or anything, but, you know, it's something.

377
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,880
Right.

378
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:48,592
You ever think of a career in law enforcement?

379
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:54,639
We could use an arm like yours.

380
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,058
Ethan Denton made bail this morning

381
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,561
after pleading not guilty to the charges against him

382
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:04,566
- for his role in the death...
- Not guilty, my ass!

383
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:09,613
I hope that jury fucking puts him away.

384
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:13,074
Whatever happens, it's in the hands of the Lord now.

385
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:17,287
That's supposed to be comforting?

386
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:20,373
What are you doing with my beer?

387
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,792
You've had enough, Cindy.

388
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:28,840
You have your god, I have mine.

389
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:32,135
Denton will not be making a statement at this time.

390
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:33,762
When will he be ready to make a statement?

391
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,890
Hey, hey, hey.

392
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:42,938
We're on your side, Ethan. Come on, just give us...

393
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,408
Ethan.

394
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:59,704
Hey, hold up. Come on... Ethan.

395
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:05,752
Shit.

396
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:43,123
Hey, man.

397
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:47,669
Where you heading?

398
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,547
Nowhere.

399
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,550
You can crash at my place if you want

400
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,218
or at the garage.

401
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,470
We're closed down for the week.

402
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,389
Whose idea was that?

403
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,725
Mine.

404
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:04,436
- Hungry?
- No.

405
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:10,483
- I can pick you something up...
- Where were you that morning?

406
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,529
What you talking about, man?

407
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:17,157
Come on, where were you? Don't be stupid.

408
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,993
You know what I'm talking about.

409
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,494
Come on.

410
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:22,996
You come on. Where were you?

411
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,706
You know where I was. I was with a girl.

412
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,125
- Yeah? What girl?
- Come on, man.

413
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,377
No, come on. What girl?

414
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:31,254
Give me a break, man. Come on.

415
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:32,964
Tell me what girl.

416
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:34,716
You don't know her, all right?

417
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:36,217
- What girl?
- Stop it.

418
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:39,220
- What girl?
- Stop it. Come on.

419
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:44,392
What girl?

420
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:50,440
Say it. Say it!

421
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:54,569
Cindy.

422
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:58,573
- Cindy, all right?
- Cindy.

423
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:03,244
You know how close Nate was to the truck?

424
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:09,292
Less than a quarter-mile.

425
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,615
- Dude, are you looking at my screen?
- I never, ever...

426
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:25,243
You were looking at my screen, man.

427
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:31,291
Beer.

428
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:36,004
Think they let you game in prison?

429
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:39,591
I'm just saying, I mean, no work, no bills,

430
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,677
just you and the console.

431
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:44,179
For five years?

432
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,181
Some games take five years, man.

433
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:51,227
Maybe I'll get lucky and they'll let me out after three.

434
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:55,356
For good behavior?

435
00:37:55,398 --> 00:38:01,404
- You want me to pause it?
- Yeah, pause it.

436
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:10,955
- Fuck. Fuck.
- Oh, shit!

437
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:13,374
You crazy bitch!

438
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:16,377
Get the fuck out of here!

439
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:21,049
Get out of here!

440
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:24,803
Yeah, come on.

441
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:30,850
Come on.

442
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:38,900
Not guilty, my ass!

443
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:14,203
Is your dad alive?

444
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,831
No.

445
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:18,666
I bet he was a good dad, though, right,

446
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:21,002
when he was alive?

447
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,379
You being a lawyer and all,

448
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:29,385
I imagine he'd be real proud.

449
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:33,556
Something like that.

450
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:36,768
My dad's not dead.

451
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:41,147
He's not proud, either.

452
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:47,195
As a matter of fact, he's not even here.

453
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:51,908
I don't blame him.

454
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:55,828
He probably doesn't even know.

455
00:40:55,870 --> 00:41:01,876
That's why he's not here.

456
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:11,928
My dad is a shit dad.

457
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:16,766
But if he knew,

458
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:20,353
I know he'd be right here,

459
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:23,731
digging up this grave with his fingernails,

460
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:26,901
lifting Nate

461
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:29,112
out from the earth,

462
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,613
giving him mouth-to-mouth.

463
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:34,492
He'd try and bring him back to me.

464
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:39,247
He would.

465
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,332
Because what dad could just stand there

466
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:47,338
and watch a boy live through this?

467
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:54,846
I'm very sorry for your loss.

468
00:41:55,638 --> 00:42:01,644
What are you doing here?

469
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:19,954
- Here you go, number 21.
- That was fast.

470
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:26,002
Smells good.

471
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:28,421
What can I get for you?

472
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:30,590
What's the special?

473
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:32,800
It's open-faced turkey sandwich

474
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:34,302
with mashed potatoes and gravy.

475
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,803
That sounds good.

476
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:39,182
- To go?
- No.

477
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:43,061
I'd recommend it.

478
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:45,688
Well, actually I was hoping to
speak to you, Ms. Manning.

479
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:48,149
One turkey.

480
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:51,360
- I'm busy. To go.
- Well, maybe another time.

481
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:57,408
Oh, I'm always busy.

482
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:03,998
Here you go, Frank.

483
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,084
Sir.

484
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,086
Yeah.

485
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:14,092
You have any kids?

486
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:20,139
Once upon a time, yeah.

487
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:35,571
Jane.

488
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,077
- Hi.
- Hi.

489
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:47,125
Come in.

490
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:56,134
This is my partner Roxanne.

491
00:43:56,175 --> 00:44:02,056
- This is Melody.
- Hi.

492
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:04,392
Hey.

493
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:08,146
Good to meet you.

494
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:14,193
Mel.

495
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:24,328
Okay, so, uh, let me show you up to your room.

496
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:28,249
I got it.

497
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:32,003
Okay, okay.

498
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:38,050
Right up the stairs here.

499
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:45,725
These are Roxie's paintings, all of them.

500
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:48,895
- You're reading too much into it.
- Yeah, right.

501
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:51,063
Well, what do you want me to say, Roxanne?

502
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:52,607
He was raised by my ex-husband.

503
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,443
Oh, you know me, bean pole.

504
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:58,404
- I'm just venting.
- Yeah, thanks for the support.

505
00:44:58,487 --> 00:44:59,947
What? I'm hungry. I want that.

506
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:01,616
- Not for us.
- What?

507
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,367
I'll be back before you know it.

508
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:06,204
Oh, no. No, you're not leaving me here alone.

509
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:09,248
You're not leaving me here to
babysit your homophobic son

510
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:10,750
and his knocked-up little girlfriend.

511
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:15,880
- Bye.
- Jane.

512
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:21,928
Hey.

513
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:27,600
Hey.

514
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:30,144
Hi.

515
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:36,192
Why don't you take a little break,
let me fix you something to eat?

516
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:41,822
You know, I locked the door when I got out.

517
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:47,870
- I locked the truck.
- Of course you did.

518
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:53,125
And I had the heat on high.

519
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,544
I closed the door really fast

520
00:45:55,586 --> 00:46:01,592
when I got out s-so that it w-would stay warm.

521
00:46:02,927 --> 00:46:08,933
He was still warm when I left him.

522
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:13,104
He didn't know how to get out of his seat.

523
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:17,233
That's the thing... he didn't...
didn't know how to do that.

524
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:19,318
- I know, baby.
- You know?

525
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:25,366
I know.

526
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:35,042
I know.

527
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:42,425
It's not your fault.

528
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:48,472
It's not your fault.

529
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:03,612
What are you doing here?

530
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:07,199
I don't know.

531
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:09,910
I couldn't think of anywhere else to go.

532
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:13,622
Rosie's fast asleep.

533
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:19,670
- How about I get you a cup of coffee?
- Yeah.

534
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,141
I was with Cindy that morning.

535
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:34,685
I know.

536
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:40,733
I saw you there.

537
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:50,743
Thanks.

538
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:53,329
Oh, so you think that if you hadn't been there,

539
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:59,377
maybe things would have been different.

540
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:09,387
That DA came by here.

541
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:11,597
The thing is,

542
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,600
I never thought that Ethan

543
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:19,063
was that great of a dad.

544
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,524
No?

545
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:26,445
No. I mean, I know he loved Nate and all,

546
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:28,364
but there were always little things,

547
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:31,659
like he would let him out of his
sight for a moment too long

548
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:36,247
or he would drink beer in the truck.

549
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:40,501
And I never said anything.

550
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:46,549
Never.

551
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:14,076
Oh, Jesus Christ.

552
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:15,911
They're young.

553
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:18,581
I'd better not have to fucking listen
to that every other night.

554
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:23,127
We won't. They're leaving soon.

555
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:27,214
He just wants money.

556
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:29,592
Yeah, well,

557
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:33,679
what did you expect... love?

558
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:35,598
You left him when he was 10 years old.

559
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:41,645
I know.

560
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:52,508
Can I help you?

561
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:56,845
Uh, I was just gonna take a closer look.

562
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:59,765
That's why we have display models.

563
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:02,434
I'm sorry. I'll put it back.

564
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:05,938
Here, let me do that.

565
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:08,315
Hey, you haven't had a recall

566
00:51:08,357 --> 00:51:10,359
on this item or anything, have you?

567
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:12,861
We wouldn't be selling it if there was a recall.

568
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,864
Do you get many complaints?

569
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:19,201
Like about... see this part, like the...

570
00:51:19,243 --> 00:51:21,662
Or this, the latch, not staying buckled?

571
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,163
- Not that I know of.
- Anything?

572
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:25,374
Look, why don't you just go online

573
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:29,420
and look at some consumer reviews or something?

574
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:35,467
You know, that's a real good idea. Thanks.

575
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:40,639
Can I have a price check for Similac

576
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:46,687
on aisle three, please?

577
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,570
I just need just a little bit of clarity here,

578
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,530
because I'm trying to figure out what's happening.

579
00:51:56,572 --> 00:51:59,074
The insurance claim was denied?

580
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:02,995
- We don't actually know.
- I think so, yeah.

581
00:52:03,078 --> 00:52:07,583
Ethan and Nate stayed with you guys, correct?

582
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:10,419
Yeah, the water damage destroyed the kitchen.

583
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:14,256
It was inconvenient for them to
stay there during construction,

584
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:16,425
so, yeah, they stayed with us.

585
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:18,427
- Well, who paid for the construction?
- Ethan did.

586
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:19,928
He worked overtime to pay for it.

587
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,430
He's a very hard worker.

588
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,974
Because the insurance claim was denied?

589
00:52:24,016 --> 00:52:28,270
I'm not actually sure.

590
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:30,439
Of course it was denied.

591
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:36,487
The faucet in the tub was left on
for hours. It was negligence.

592
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:41,325
Thank you.

593
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:43,202
- What?
- Nothing.

594
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:46,830
What? Speak your mind for once, please.

595
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,707
- It's not really the time.
- Why not?

596
00:52:48,749 --> 00:52:51,919
Who gives a fuck what this guy thinks? Say it.

597
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,629
Ever since I told you George was coming,

598
00:52:53,712 --> 00:52:55,547
you've been a total cunt.

599
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:58,676
Well, just give me one more question, you guys,

600
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:00,427
and I'll get out of your hair.

601
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:02,971
How long did Ethan and Nate stay with you guys

602
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:05,641
after Ethan flooded the house?

603
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:07,434
Ethan didn't flood the house. He wasn't even there.

604
00:53:07,476 --> 00:53:13,482
Cindy was.

605
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:28,455
- You like it black?
- I do, thank you.

606
00:53:28,497 --> 00:53:30,708
Okay.

607
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:32,751
Oh, I'm sorry if I woke you.

608
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:34,670
Let me introduce myself. I'm Jack Craft.

609
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:37,548
- This is the district attorney.
- Nice to meet you.

610
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:43,178
I need coffee.

611
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,597
I had her when I was very young.

612
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:51,645
Clearly.

613
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,023
Miss Mills, I don't know if you're aware of this,

614
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:59,194
but the state is prosecuting Ethan Denton

615
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:01,572
for his role in Nate's death.

616
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:03,574
It's Cindy.

617
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:08,120
And I know all about the trial.

618
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:11,039
I was wondering if you'd be willing to help me.

619
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:13,041
Like what? Testify?

620
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,419
No, no, no. That's getting way ahead of ourselves.

621
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:19,381
I was just trying to get some background information.

622
00:54:19,423 --> 00:54:21,258
Like what?

623
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:25,387
Like, you know, what kind of father Ethan was,

624
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:27,055
you know, from your perspective.

625
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:32,686
- My perspective?
- Yeah.

626
00:54:32,728 --> 00:54:37,232
You may not be aware of this, but...

627
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,859
Fuck.

628
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:42,488
But I have an itsy bitsy problem with alcohol.

629
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:48,535
That's why Nate lived with Ethan in the first place.

630
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:55,584
You're not the one that's on trial here; Ethan is.

631
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:57,544
You may be an alcoholic,

632
00:54:57,586 --> 00:55:00,339
but you're not the one who chose to drive your son

633
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:01,840
into the woods in a snowstorm.

634
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:04,134
You didn't, totally sober,

635
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:07,012
make the decision to leave Nate in a truck

636
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:09,348
to track a deer...

637
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:13,519
a fucking deer.

638
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,729
Excuse me.

639
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:18,774
Ethan's actions would be more understandable...

640
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:21,276
not less negligent, but more understandable,

641
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:24,029
had he been drunk at the time.

642
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:26,532
That's a twisted fucking argument.

643
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:31,995
Now, maybe he chose an inappropriate babysitter.

644
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:34,790
Maybe he's done a lot of fucked-up
things during his life.

645
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:38,085
Maybe this isn't the first time that he chose hunting

646
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:44,132
over taking care of his son.

647
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:49,471
All I'm asking is for you to think about it, all right?

648
00:55:49,513 --> 00:55:53,809
If something comes to you, if you remember anything,

649
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:56,603
you simply write it down.

650
00:55:56,645 --> 00:55:59,565
I've taken too much of your time.

651
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:01,066
Not at all.

652
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:07,114
You ladies have a good morning.

653
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:13,996
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

654
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:20,043
God be with you.

655
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:32,931
He seems really smart, doesn't he?

656
00:56:32,973 --> 00:56:34,725
I guess.

657
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:37,102
I think he's gonna put Ethan away.

658
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:43,150
Maybe.

659
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:54,036
Why didn't you give Nathan the
birthday present I sent him?

660
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:55,704
I... I was going...

661
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:58,665
I didn't have a chance. I was going to.

662
00:56:58,707 --> 00:57:01,835
Just, uh... I saw it in the closet and I wondered.

663
00:57:01,877 --> 00:57:07,883
- I was going to.
- I believe you.

664
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:13,263
What did you give him?

665
00:57:13,305 --> 00:57:19,311
Made to order.

666
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:22,731
Oh, best thing I ever put in my mouth.

667
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:27,444
- You want some?
- I don't do dick.

668
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:29,613
- Hey, Ange.
- Hey, Rusty.

669
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:33,367
Can you take some food over to the garage for me,

670
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,035
for Ethan?

671
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,828
Oh, now's not really a good time.

672
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:41,416
No? Okay, I'll have Rox take it over for me.

673
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:47,464
So, can I get you guys anything else?

674
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:57,391
- Ethan.
- Hi. Hi.

675
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:00,060
- What are you doing here?
- I got...

676
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:02,813
Oh, this is Melody. She's the uh...

677
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:06,942
Knocked-up little girlfriend of Jane's homophobic son.

678
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,610
Yeah.

679
00:58:08,652 --> 00:58:10,278
Hey, that's a cute seat.

680
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,280
I was thinking of getting one.

681
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:13,907
It's a piece of shit.

682
00:58:13,949 --> 00:58:19,955
So, Ange wanted me to drop off some food for you.

683
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:32,551
I'll be right back.

684
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:39,516
- What do you use?
- Bolt action, 30-30.

685
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,728
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

686
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,563
Can I buy you a cup of coffee?

687
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:47,691
Not in this lifetime.

688
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:53,739
Just a heads up then... you'll be getting a subpoena.

689
00:58:57,492 --> 00:59:01,496
All right.

690
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:06,251
I'm not testifying against Ethan.

691
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:08,754
You were with him when he found Nate.

692
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:10,505
All I expect you to do

693
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,841
is describe that experience, that's it.

694
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:15,385
- I can do that.
- All right.

695
00:59:15,427 --> 00:59:18,346
I can tell about how I never saw
a person so wrecked as Ethan

696
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:22,225
when he dug up his son from the snow.

697
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:26,605
I can tell the jury how much bullshit this trial is

698
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:28,190
and how losing your own kid

699
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:30,358
doesn't give you license to shit on the rest of us.

700
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:34,613
I'll ask you how Nate was found, what he was wearing,

701
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:37,699
how he looked when you saw him,

702
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:40,035
the state of his toes, color of his skin,

703
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:41,536
how low the temperature got.

704
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:47,542
You answer all my...

705
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:03,183
Hey, man.

706
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:09,231
Hey.

707
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:13,610
I... I just came by to say... I'm sorry.

708
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:17,948
You know, I'm just really sorry.

709
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:19,866
For what?

710
01:00:19,908 --> 01:00:23,870
For not being there when you called.

711
01:00:23,912 --> 01:00:25,997
For Cindy.

712
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:30,252
It doesn't matter.

713
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:36,299
It really doesn't matter.

714
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:42,264
What you doing there?

715
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:45,142
I can't figure the goddamn thing out.

716
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:47,769
I read online all these complaints about it, right?

717
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:50,814
Like, this one woman, she said that
the buckle would just come undone.

718
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:52,315
Like, it would just pop open

719
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:53,650
after she buckled her kid in.

720
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:56,486
So I kept taking the damn thing apart

721
01:00:56,528 --> 01:00:59,781
and putting it back together, and I can't find the glitch.

722
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:02,284
What glitch?

723
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:04,161
You know, the glitch... the glitch that,

724
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:09,082
you know, makes the buckle come undone.

725
01:01:09,124 --> 01:01:12,669
Okay.

726
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:15,046
I have to... I have to get this kind of evidence,

727
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:18,008
you know, because...

728
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:24,055
Huh?

729
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:28,894
Hey, why don't you come crash
at my place for a while?

730
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:30,395
No, no, no.

731
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:33,815
No. I'm really fine here. I'm fine.

732
01:01:33,857 --> 01:01:36,443
Yeah, yeah, you know, I can see that,

733
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:39,279
but, you know, I thought maybe

734
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:41,281
you could use a fresh pair of eyes, you know.

735
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:47,287
We can bring the car seat, work on it together.

736
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:51,124
You'd work on it with me?

737
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:53,293
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

738
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:56,379
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

739
01:01:56,421 --> 01:02:00,508
Come on. We'll go get some food,

740
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,385
camp out at my place.

741
01:02:02,427 --> 01:02:04,679
It'll be great.

742
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:07,349
- I don't know, man.
- Dude...

743
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:10,060
this place reeks anyway, man, you know?

744
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:12,520
Man, come on. I don't even know
what this is, you know?

745
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:16,483
It was once upon a time bacon, but now...

746
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:22,530
Jeez.

747
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:30,247
All right. Thanks, man.

748
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:34,167
All right. I'll get the seat.

749
01:02:34,209 --> 01:02:40,215
- You got it?
- Oh, yeah.

750
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:42,884
So, when'd you last take a shower?

751
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:45,387
- I don't know. It's been a while.
- Oh, yeah?

752
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:47,514
First thing I'm gonna do is take a hose

753
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:49,933
to that skinny-ass body of yours.

754
01:02:50,016 --> 01:02:55,939
- I just gotta lock up.
- Okay.

755
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:12,580
See you there.

756
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:24,426
Whiskey?

757
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:26,344
- Hey, Cindy.
- Hey.

758
01:03:26,386 --> 01:03:28,722
What are you doing here?

759
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:32,434
Same thing as you, I guess.

760
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:34,853
Have you seen Ethan?

761
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:37,272
Not really.

762
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:39,274
I thought you two were close.

763
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:44,654
No, Jane's the one.

764
01:03:44,696 --> 01:03:47,824
But you used to take care of...

765
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:52,704
Sometimes, yeah.

766
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:56,333
Was he good for you?

767
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:59,377
- The best.
- Good.

768
01:03:59,419 --> 01:04:03,840
He was a good baby, too. He didn't cry too much.

769
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:05,383
We'd build forts in the living room

770
01:04:05,425 --> 01:04:06,885
with pillows and blankets and shit.

771
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:11,639
He loved that. Yeah.

772
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:15,101
That must have been fun.

773
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:17,645
No, not really. I'd set the pillows up,

774
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,898
he'd pull them down, throw them all over the place,

775
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:22,025
then want me to set them up all the fuck over again,

776
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:28,073
but it was fun for him.

777
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:32,744
It's on me.

778
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:35,455
To know that Jesus is your savior,

779
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:38,166
but he's also your friend.

780
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:44,214
You can put your trust in Him.

781
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:46,674
Let us pray to the Lord.

782
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:48,593
Can you hear me, O Lord?

783
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:52,389
♪ Can you hear me? ♪

784
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:54,808
When I ask You to be my friend.

785
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:57,852
♪ Be my friend... ♪

786
01:04:57,894 --> 01:05:03,858
There's only one way to come to Jesus...

787
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:06,986
Where have you been?

788
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:11,866
At work, I told you that.

789
01:05:11,908 --> 01:05:15,745
I was listening to that.

790
01:05:15,787 --> 01:05:20,291
My house, my rules, your words.

791
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:24,712
What's wrong with you?

792
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:27,966
What's wrong with me?

793
01:05:28,049 --> 01:05:32,053
What do you think?

794
01:05:32,095 --> 01:05:34,514
I defrosted a casserole for dinner.

795
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:36,850
I don't want a fucking casserole.

796
01:05:36,933 --> 01:05:39,310
Then what would you like to eat?

797
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:40,645
I don't want anything to eat.

798
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:42,480
I want you to just stop fucking doing

799
01:05:42,522 --> 01:05:48,528
my fucking laundry any more, either!

800
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:54,200
You ungrateful shit.

801
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:56,119
Slut.

802
01:05:56,202 --> 01:06:02,167
Look at the way you live.

803
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:16,014
My baby's dead.

804
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:25,773
You were Nate's mother,

805
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:30,445
and you let that boy take him away.

806
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:32,071
No, that's not my fault.

807
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:34,991
You let that boy take him away
and let him freeze to death.

808
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:38,203
- That's not my fault.
- It was your choice.

809
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:40,622
In what universe was it my choice?
I wasn't even there.

810
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:45,919
It was your choice to let Ethan have him.

811
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:51,382
What did you want me to do?

812
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:57,430
What was I supposed to do?!

813
01:07:00,183 --> 01:07:06,189
You should have let me have him.

814
01:07:39,639 --> 01:07:43,685
Cindy?

815
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:49,732
Cindy?

816
01:07:55,863 --> 01:07:59,701
Hey. Wanna wear this?

817
01:07:59,784 --> 01:08:03,204
That was Ethan's, Angie.

818
01:08:03,246 --> 01:08:09,252
- I'm sorry.
- Let me see it.

819
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:13,756
It used to smell like him.

820
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:19,804
Oh, God, I miss him so much.

821
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:26,102
We all miss Nate.

822
01:08:26,185 --> 01:08:28,938
No, not Nate.

823
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:34,986
Ethan.

824
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:40,450
- Try my tea.
- No.

825
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:45,538
- Do it.
- No, no.

826
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:48,583
Hey, stop it.

827
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:54,672
Oh, I know. Rachel.

828
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:04,223
Ethan.

829
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:07,477
- Hey, how are you?
- Good.

830
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,271
Paul, I haven't seen you in a while.

831
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:13,358
- Good to see you.
- Thanks, man. You, too.

832
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:17,945
Ethan, I am terribly sorry...

833
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:23,576
but we have no more turkey.

834
01:09:23,618 --> 01:09:25,703
- Uh...
- We got ham.

835
01:09:25,745 --> 01:09:27,747
- You got ham?
- Ham it is.

836
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:30,958
- Ham.
- One ham!

837
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,002
Put it in.

838
01:09:33,044 --> 01:09:35,046
Put the poop and pee in.

839
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:37,548
Okay, now mix it up.

840
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:39,467
There's poop and pee in it.

841
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:41,594
- Oh!
- We're pretending.

842
01:09:41,636 --> 01:09:44,305
May we have French fries please?

843
01:09:44,347 --> 01:09:46,265
All right, then, little ladies.

844
01:09:46,307 --> 01:09:47,767
You'll have to sit behind the counter

845
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:52,772
and take your order like regular customers.

846
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:54,273
Someone's in here.

847
01:09:54,315 --> 01:09:57,318
It's me. You okay?

848
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,529
Trying to take a shit in peace.

849
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:05,576
Sorry.

850
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:26,723
Whoo! Can Nate play?

851
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:28,683
No.

852
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:30,518
Why not?

853
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:32,729
He's not here.

854
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:38,776
Is he at your house?

855
01:10:40,027 --> 01:10:45,533
- Where is he?
- I don't know, okay?

856
01:10:45,616 --> 01:10:50,830
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm not mad at you.

857
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:54,625
Nate's just on a trip.

858
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:56,127
Okay?

859
01:10:56,210 --> 01:11:02,175
I want to go on a trip.

860
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:08,473
It's too cold. Come on.

861
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:18,524
Why don't you get in the car seat over there?

862
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:21,277
- Can we get some biscuits and gravy?
- Yeah, that's fine.

863
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,446
Not too tight, is it?

864
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:29,494
- Nope.
- No? All right.

865
01:11:29,827 --> 01:11:32,538
Hey, sweetie. Where's Rosie?

866
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:35,124
We can go on an adventure.

867
01:11:35,166 --> 01:11:39,086
Yeah, we're going on an adventure.

868
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:41,506
Rosie!

869
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:43,132
Rosie?

870
01:11:43,174 --> 01:11:49,138
Hey, Ethan, stop!

871
01:11:49,847 --> 01:11:51,307
What?

872
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:52,892
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

873
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:54,727
What the hell were you thinking
taking Rosie without asking me?

874
01:11:54,769 --> 01:11:56,813
We're just going for a drive. We're not going far.

875
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:58,773
The hell you are. You're not going
anywhere. Come on, Rosie.

876
01:11:58,856 --> 01:12:01,484
Come on out, baby. Get out of the truck.

877
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:03,361
Calm down.

878
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:09,325
- She's like my sister.
- Well, Nate was your son.

879
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:14,997
Rosie, come on, come on.

880
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:17,416
- She can do that?
- Do what?

881
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:20,127
Unbuckle herself, get out of her seat like that?

882
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:23,214
- Yeah.
- For how long?

883
01:12:23,297 --> 01:12:26,259
How long has she been able to
get out of the seat by herself?

884
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:32,306
I don't know. A while!

885
01:13:13,973 --> 01:13:15,933
Fly away!

886
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:21,939
Look how high it's going!

887
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:57,433
What's wrong, Mommy?

888
01:13:57,516 --> 01:14:03,481
Nate's gone. That's what's wrong.

889
01:14:04,315 --> 01:14:06,067
Come in.

890
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:07,568
Cindy Mills is here to see you.

891
01:14:07,610 --> 01:14:10,029
Oh, good. Cindy, how are you?

892
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:12,198
Have a seat.

893
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:14,492
- I wanted to give you this.
- Good.

894
01:14:14,575 --> 01:14:17,036
I bet this is gonna be great. Thank you.

895
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:20,456
- Read it.
- All right.

896
01:14:20,539 --> 01:14:22,750
"Didn't go to birth class at hospital."

897
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:26,754
"Drove drunk while baby was in the car."

898
01:14:26,837 --> 01:14:29,340
"Drank vodka while breastfeeding."

899
01:14:29,423 --> 01:14:31,592
"Smoked heavily around baby."

900
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:34,136
It's all I could come up with.

901
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:40,184
Well...

902
01:15:42,621 --> 01:15:48,419
Go away, Rusty. Go.

903
01:15:48,502 --> 01:15:53,716
Oh, God.

904
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:58,637
Fuck.

905
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:04,685
Rusty knows how to work the dryer, right?

906
01:16:31,378 --> 01:16:37,301
You were right to take Nate from me.

907
01:16:37,968 --> 01:16:43,933
I'm a shit mom.

908
01:16:44,141 --> 01:16:50,106
And now you're a shit dad, too.

909
01:17:18,092 --> 01:17:23,472
Please stay.

910
01:17:23,514 --> 01:17:29,520
Stay.

911
01:17:47,788 --> 01:17:53,752
Cindy?

912
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:05,681
I'm so, so sorry.

913
01:18:33,959 --> 01:18:37,463
Hi. Celina Cervantes please.

914
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:41,050
It's Ethan Denton.

915
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:43,344
- What's going on? Am I late?
- No, no.

916
01:18:43,427 --> 01:18:45,346
- Cervantes just called.
- Uh-huh.

917
01:18:45,429 --> 01:18:49,516
Denton boy wants to change his plea to guilty.

918
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:51,018
He wants to change his plea.

919
01:18:51,101 --> 01:18:53,646
- It's good news, right?
- No.

920
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:57,316
Okay, would you mind if I left a little early?

921
01:18:57,399 --> 01:18:59,860
Yeah, I would. I would, actually.

922
01:18:59,902 --> 01:19:01,695
My son's got a game.

923
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:05,074
Well, take it off, then. Go ahead.

924
01:19:05,157 --> 01:19:06,242
- Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

925
01:19:06,283 --> 01:19:12,289
Thank you.

926
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:28,681
Where are you going?

927
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:31,392
Home.

928
01:19:31,475 --> 01:19:35,813
Before you go...

929
01:19:35,896 --> 01:19:41,694
can you tell me something about him?

930
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:47,700
Just one thing?

931
01:19:50,494 --> 01:19:53,539
He'd carry his walkie-talkie around all the time,

932
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:56,583
like it was his cell phone.

933
01:19:56,625 --> 01:20:02,631
He was always expecting a call.

934
01:21:44,066 --> 01:21:46,193
This is Ranger Bear

935
01:21:46,276 --> 01:21:50,531
calling Ranger Pup.

936
01:21:50,614 --> 01:21:54,326
Do you read me?

937
01:21:54,368 --> 01:22:00,374
Do you read me?

938
01:22:28,485 --> 01:22:32,739
Hey.

939
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:34,533
Hey.

940
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:38,662
Rusty said you moved back home.

941
01:22:38,745 --> 01:22:40,706
It was time.

942
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:42,583
Is George still around?

943
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:44,418
No, they left.

944
01:22:44,501 --> 01:22:49,423
- I'm sorry.
- Me, too.

945
01:22:49,506 --> 01:22:52,634
Rox says they'll be back, but I don't know.

946
01:22:52,676 --> 01:22:55,304
He came to you when he was in trouble, right?

947
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:56,930
Yeah.

948
01:22:56,972 --> 01:23:02,936
He'll get in trouble again.

949
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:06,773
Thanks.

950
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:12,321
You know what?

951
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:17,117
I think Judge McKay is gonna be lenient.

952
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:18,952
Yeah.

953
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:22,122
Yeah, that's what...

954
01:23:22,164 --> 01:23:24,625
what Celina says.

955
01:23:24,708 --> 01:23:29,630
She's guessing 30 days and community service.

956
01:23:29,713 --> 01:23:31,632
That's not so bad.

957
01:23:31,715 --> 01:23:35,969
It's okay, right?

958
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:38,597
I'll just see you later at the diner.

959
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:44,645
- Okay, I'll see you then.
- Okay.

960
01:23:52,152 --> 01:23:56,114
Ethan, this is Celina again.

961
01:23:56,156 --> 01:23:59,368
We need to go over your statement before tomorrow.

962
01:23:59,451 --> 01:24:01,620
What you say to the judge might very well have

963
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:07,668
a direct effect on your sentencing.
