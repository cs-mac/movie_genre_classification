1
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,429
We all come from the sea...

2
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,514
...but we are not all of the sea.

3
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:06,857
Those of us who are,
we children of the tides...

4
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:10,360
...must return to it
again and again.

5
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:37,679
4 a thousand. 5 a thousand.

6
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:41,183
6 a thousand.
7 a thousand.

7
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,976
8 a thousand.

8
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,603
9 a thousand.

9
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:49,691
1 a thousand.
2 a thousand.

10
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:52,861
3 a thousand.
4 a thousand.

11
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,154
5 a thousand.

12
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:56,281
6 a thousand.

13
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,325
7 a thousand.
8 a thousand.

14
00:01:58,493 --> 00:01:59,910
Go. Ball. Go over there!

15
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,745
Pick it up, pick it up,
pick it up.

16
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,539
10 a thousand.
Come on!

17
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:06,208
11 a thousand.

18
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,377
Come on, Jay, let's go!
We're gonna get wet.

19
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,878
Man, did you see that?

20
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,381
lt's building!

21
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,883
That was the longest one yet.

22
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:18,428
1 a thousand.
2 a thousand.

23
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,014
Oh.
3 a thousand.

24
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,349
4 a thousand.

25
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,226
5--
Sophie, no!

26
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,445
Jay, no! Look out!

27
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,576
Jay!

28
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,976
Oh, yeah, you're smiling now, big shot.

29
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:51,146
But if l hadn't paddled around the Point
at that exact moment....

30
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,232
lt's a miracle, that's what it is.

31
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,692
And l don't believe in miracles.
How old are you?

32
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,527
What, 6, 7?

33
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:58,737
8.

34
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,322
And 3 quarters, sir.

35
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,158
Well, you just used up your entire
allotment of dumb luck.

36
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,577
Here's a novel idea.

37
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,622
On your next little date,
why don't you go to the arcade...

38
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,249
...or pee-wee golfing.

39
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,834
Or something that doesn't
involve getting you killed.

40
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:15,754
Because he likes to time the waves.
Shh.

41
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,714
What? You do.

42
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,424
What do you mean,
time the waves?

43
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:24,972
Um, to see if the swell
is building or dropping.

44
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,182
The more seconds
between them...

45
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,686
...each wave in a set,
it means it's getting bigger.

46
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,479
Who taught you that?

47
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,314
Nobody, sir.

48
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,441
Just figured it out.

49
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,486
You just figured that out
on your own?

50
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:43,198
Okay.

51
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:55,377
Thanks. Bye.

52
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,170
Bye. Okay.
Bye.

53
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,131
Go straight inside,
all right?

54
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,259
Close the door.

55
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,022
What now?

56
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:17,482
How big you reckon
that wave was, sir?

57
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,026
lt's a small world, kid...

58
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:22,070
...but how they gauge the size
of waves, well, that differs...

59
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:25,365
...from place to place,
so, hard to say.

60
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,951
So it might be bigger
somewhere else?

61
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,747
Look...

62
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,623
...it was definitely
big enough, okay?

63
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:49,431
Like l said, kid, small world.

64
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:55,437
l appreciate you
saving Sophie, Jay.

65
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,607
One of the bravest things
l've ever seen.

66
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:40,982
Mom?

67
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,668
Hi, baby.

68
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:03,171
Unh. Sorry, Mama's not feeling
so good.

69
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,342
Don't worry...

70
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,512
...Dad will change his mind.

71
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,183
There are hot dogs
in the fridge.

72
00:07:58,436 --> 00:07:59,936
Hey.

73
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,064
Hey.
Need a hand?

74
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,942
Heh. What with,
the coffee or the cupboard?

75
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,448
Uh, you just missed
Roque again.

76
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,451
Just put her down.

77
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,245
Ahem. Yeah.

78
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:21,124
l had to help a friend out after work.
Mm-hm.

79
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,627
l'll go in, l'll give her a kiss.

80
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,924
Kiss would be nice.

81
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:32,427
Conversation every
once in a while, maybe nicer.

82
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,768
Time to wake up, Jay.

83
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,730
Okay.

84
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,023
How do l look?

85
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,942
You look awesome.

86
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:51,488
l have an interview at Sears.

87
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:55,033
So, l'm coming home at 12:00
and we are going to get school supplies.

88
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,493
Good luck.

89
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:57,786
Thank you.

90
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,357
Excuse me. Ma'am?

91
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:11,443
Hi.
Your husband home?

92
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,070
Uh, well, depends on who's asking.

93
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:16,364
l'm Jay Moriarity, ma'am.

94
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,617
He saved my life
down at 3 Mile yesterday.

95
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,869
Oh, sweetie, l'm sorry,
l think you're mistaken...

96
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:24,039
...because Frosty was up
in Scott's Valley laying roof yesterday.

97
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:26,875
No, ma'am. He was surfing
the exact same time...

98
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:28,877
...l used up my allotment
of dumb luck.

99
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,463
ls that so?

100
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:35,050
Frosty is actually
down at The Point right now...

101
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:38,887
...but is there anything that l can
help you with, Jay Moriarity?

102
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:44,976
Well, l seem to be missing parts
on the bottom of my board.

103
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,814
Okay.

104
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,983
Fins, fins, fins.

105
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,821
Where does he keep them? Oh.
Wow.

106
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,993
They call that thing a gun.

107
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,081
lt's for riding
the really big monsters.

108
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,124
Like that.

109
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,168
Where is that?

110
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,920
You should ask
Frosty yourself.

111
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,254
Thanks.

112
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,538
Beat it, little trash.

113
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:27,305
Blondie,
what are you doing?

114
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,226
Hey, man,
you got to go in.

115
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,560
You're bleeding.

116
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:33,770
l can't.

117
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:36,105
Not until l get up.

118
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,608
Dude, believe me,
nobody gets up their first time.

119
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,529
Okay, okay. l'm only doing this
because you're gonna...

120
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,823
...start attracting sharks
with all that blood.

121
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,076
When l say "now,"
you paddle as hard as you can...

122
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,203
...towards shore, you got it?

123
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:55,917
Now?
No.

124
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,420
Now?
Yeah! Paddle, paddle, paddle!

125
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:25,446
Will l wake up?
Some dream l made up?

126
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:32,120
No, l guess it's reality

127
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:37,792
What will change us?
Or will we mess up

128
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:44,757
Our only chance
To connect with a dream?

129
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:50,638
Say a prayer for me
Say a prayer for me

130
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:54,851
Say a prayer for me
For me, for me

131
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:59,439
Say a prayer for me
Say a prayer for me

132
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:04,944
I'm buried by the sound

133
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,578
Hey, paddle.
Paddle, paddle, paddle! Now!

134
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,538
Go, go, go!

135
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,540
Yeah!

136
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:20,293
You stealing a page out
of my playbook there?

137
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,463
Couldn't help myself, Blondie.

138
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,214
lt's always been a keeper.

139
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,554
Hey, little trash.

140
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:34,182
Got a question for you.
Yeah.

141
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,768
What exactly are you trying
to compensate for...

142
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,853
...with this long board of yours?
Huh?

143
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,940
l was about to ask you
the same thing about that bat.

144
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,694
Y'all come back now,
you hear?

145
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,575
Come on, let's go!
Okay, okay, we're coming.

146
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,285
Sometime today, please.

147
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,374
Hey, Kim.
Hi!

148
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,750
How was it out there?

149
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:05,004
Feels good. Feels like the swell is building.
Yeah? Did you time it?

150
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,173
Kimmy, come on, we got to go.

151
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:10,134
Um, all right, well,
maybe l'll see you out there.

152
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,388
Later. Whoo!

153
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,936
Let her be, dude.

154
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,355
She's too old for you.

155
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,776
Get out! Get out of my house! Aah!

156
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,027
Get down!
Mom!

157
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:31,197
And you stay down there!
l'm tired of this! Get off me! Okay?

158
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,699
Mom!
l'm not going anywhere!

159
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,033
Jay.

160
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:38,246
Easy, kid. This is about back rent!
She tried grabbing me!

161
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,623
All l did--
He owes us money!

162
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,084
Get off me! Unh!
No!

163
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,585
Take it easy, kid!

164
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,587
Jay! No!
Jay!

165
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,256
Jay, stop, stop! Jay!

166
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,719
Cops! Cops!

167
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,095
They're coming!
Come on!

168
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,807
Hey, hey! Break it up! Break it up!

169
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,935
Get off me!

170
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,860
This is Victor-1-2. We're on the scene.

171
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,878
Offshore buoys
are reporting seas of 25 feet at 16 seconds.

172
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,634
Coming from the west
northwest at 295 degrees.

173
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:17,595
Northwest winds are
forecasted at 15 to 20 knots.

174
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,598
Swells are expected
to reach up to 28 feet...

175
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,017
...at 17 seconds near shore.

176
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,427
Morning, Frank.
Careful out there, son.

177
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,618
Hey, buddy.
What's up?

178
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,081
Next level out
there today, boys.

179
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,167
25 at 16.

180
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,878
Let's rock and roll.

181
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,254
Right.

182
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,423
Let's do it.

183
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:57,064
Yeah, Frosty!

184
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,908
Now, we'll agree to forget
how you got up here...

185
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:13,080
...but as far as most are concerned, that
wave's a myth. Like a Loch Ness monster.

186
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:16,834
The 4 of us who surf there
want to keep it that way. ls that clear?

187
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:22,965
Buoys reporting swells of 28 feet
at 17 seconds coming from--

188
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:34,018
How big was that wave?
Did you hear what l just said?

189
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,229
Yes, sir.

190
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:38,939
Loch Ness monster.

191
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:53,746
How's it going over there?

192
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:56,374
Mom's not renting out
the back anymore.

193
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,417
Means l get my own room.

194
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:01,045
But l got to double-up
my shifts at Pleasure Pizza.

195
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,256
And your father?

196
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:09,136
He wrote me a letter a few years
back from his base in Panama.

197
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,139
So what'd he say?

198
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,267
l don't know.

199
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,354
Never opened it.

200
00:23:22,442 --> 00:23:23,776
All right, well...

201
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:26,654
...l got to get out of here.
Got to get to work.

202
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:32,660
Hey, sir, l want
to ride that wave.

203
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,328
l want to take that drop.

204
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:35,704
Not gonna happen.

205
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:37,331
Why not?

206
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,708
Because untrained boys
don't step in the ring...

207
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,502
...with Mike Tyson,
that's why.

208
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,837
l can handle it.

209
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,005
You don't just do it.

210
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:47,675
Buddy, l've been surfing
that break for 20 years.

211
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,511
You have any idea how much
strength and know-how you need...

212
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,179
...to survive a break like that?

213
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:55,766
Frosty, l'm getting stronger by the day.
l'll hold my own.

214
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,894
Stronger by the day, huh?
Yeah.

215
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:01,272
Okay, give me your hand.

216
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,066
Now resist me.

217
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,526
Okay, that all you got?

218
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,280
ls that it? ls that it?

219
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,198
Ow! Ow, ow, ow.

220
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:14,201
Okay. You ain't strong enough.

221
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,247
Right now, l'm surfing
every single day, right?

222
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,082
So, if l--
Shut up, all right?

223
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,002
Now, l know how good you are.

224
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,129
l've seen you out there.

225
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,506
You surf circles around
those other kids.

226
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,551
But those are normal waves.

227
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:33,721
Surfing normal waves
is about how you perform...

228
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,681
...when everything goes right.

229
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,976
Now, big-wave surfing,
that's a different ball game.

230
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:41,896
That's about how you perform
when everything goes wrong.

231
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:45,357
One bump off the face
of that wave...

232
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:48,652
...and you're hitting the water
like concrete at 50 miles an hour.

233
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,739
And you got a thousand tons of
water coming down on top of you.

234
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,575
lt's knocking you senseless,
ripping you apart...

235
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,161
...and pushing you down
to a place that is so deep...

236
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:00,623
...and so dark, you don't
want to be there.

237
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,084
So why do it?

238
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:10,424
Heh. Come on, get out of here.
l got work to do.

239
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:15,262
Train me, then. Train me to ride it.
Did you hear what l said?

240
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,431
Go on, get.

241
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,152
You don't get it, do you?

242
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:37,535
What?

243
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:42,540
There are all kinds of sons,
Frosty, you know?

244
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:46,460
Some are born to you
and some just occur to you.

245
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:50,297
Jay has looked up to you
his entire life.

246
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:52,591
l mean, can't you see
how much he needs you?

247
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,843
You want me to teach
him to surf that wave?

248
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,637
He's a kid.

249
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,223
You made me promise
l wouldn't even surf that--

250
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,809
Yeah, and you break that promise
every chance you get.

251
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,311
You think l don't know
where you were this morning?

252
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:07,106
l heard the message on the machine.
"25 at 16"? Come on.

253
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:09,233
l don't know
where you're going with this.

254
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,278
That boy's gonna surf that wave
anyway. You know that, right?

255
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,863
Even if he dies trying.

256
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,866
l mean, wouldn't you?

257
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,349
She's the one that keeps the dream alive

258
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:46,270
Okay, 2 Hawaiians, 2 Santa Barbara...

259
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,397
...1 pepperoni and 1 cheese.
All right.

260
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:49,815
Thank you.

261
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:52,568
Well, it's a brimful of asha

262
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:54,236
Dude. Dude.

263
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:57,698
lt goes, first sauce,
then cheese, then toppings.

264
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:00,159
lt's not rocket science.

265
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:03,495
You all right? You haven't been here
since you got here, man.

266
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:06,290
You ever see something
and you think...

267
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,835
...like, it's the reason you were put here?
l mean, like, on this earth?

268
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,879
Sure, man.

269
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,756
Every time l turn on Baywatch.

270
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:21,972
Right, keep it moving.
Pleasure Pizza. Okay.

271
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,558
Hey, Blond, l'll be right back.
Hold on, hold on.

272
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,310
Hey, dude,
where are you going now?

273
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,562
l'll be right back.
You're killing me here!

274
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,106
Hi, sir.
Okay, here's the deal.

275
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:34,401
l'm gonna train you for one thing
and for one thing only:

276
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:38,530
To survive that wave. All right?
You want to know why?

277
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:42,743
Because l don't want it
on my conscience. That's it.

278
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,995
No questions, no arguing,
end of story.

279
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,915
l teach you what you need
to know, and it's over.

280
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,416
You got it?

281
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:50,959
Got it.
Now, the reason...

282
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:53,671
...no one knows about this wave...

283
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,340
...is because it only happens
on big northwest swells.

284
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:59,593
And the window for those swells
closes in 12 weeks.

285
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,220
So you got 12 weeks.

286
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:05,933
Meet me in my shed
tomorrow morning, 6:30 a.m.

287
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,102
Not 6:31 or 6:32.

288
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,317
Yes! Yes! Yes!

289
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,411
Hey. Ooh.

290
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:28,539
Don't bother with that.
We're not surfing.

291
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,043
Paddleboards.

292
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,045
All right. Unh.

293
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:38,382
A few things we need to
establish before we begin.

294
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,259
First...

295
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:45,431
...thou shalt not ding Frosty's board
or damage thy neighbor's car.

296
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:46,974
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

297
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:50,477
Second,
this little, uh, program...

298
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:53,772
...is all about building
what l like to call...

299
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:59,069
...the 4 pillars of a solid
human foundation. Understand?

300
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:00,904
Yes, sir.
How could you?

301
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:03,323
l haven't even
told you what they are.

302
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,411
Steady rhythm.

303
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,079
Drive and glide.

304
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:23,177
The 4 pillars
of the human foundation...

305
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:28,682
...are the physical, the mental,
the emotional and the spiritual.

306
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:32,352
Though l admit to being a little
bit wobbly in that department.

307
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,521
l'm not sure l understand, sir.

308
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,649
You know what a thesis is?

309
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,693
Uh, an idea.
Exactly.

310
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:43,030
An idea which attempts
to explain something.

311
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,032
Lays it out to be
proved or disproved.

312
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,034
So here's our thesis:

313
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,828
lt's 36 miles across the bay
from Santa Cruz to Monterey.

314
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:55,709
The day that you can paddle that far will be
the day you're ready to surf Mavericks.

315
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,586
Not a moment sooner.

316
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:00,506
Frosty, that's impossible.
Oh, more so than you know.

317
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:05,552
So the physical will represent the sheer
strength needed to make the paddle.

318
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,263
So you're gonna be doing this
from now on, everyday...

319
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:09,932
...12 weeks.

320
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,433
And the mental will be...

321
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,852
...tied to your own research.

322
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,104
The calculation
of the tides and swells...

323
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:18,732
...and, of course, your ability
to navigate them all.

324
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:24,404
So, Monterey equals Mavericks.
Deal?

325
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,324
Deal.
Good.

326
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:31,745
All l need is for your mom to sign me
a permission slip accepting responsibility...

327
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,206
...for anything that's
gonna happen along the way.

328
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,250
Whoa. Frosty.

329
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:39,419
Hey, Frosty, what if
she doesn't sign it?

330
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:44,424
Deep breaths, steady rhythm.
Drive and glide.

331
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,395
Hey, Sophie. What's up, girl?

332
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:58,772
Come here, Sophie.
Shh.

333
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,774
Sophie. What are you--?

334
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,025
What are you doing here?

335
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,235
My parents are asleep.

336
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,780
Can you sign me a permission slip
with my mom's signature on it?

337
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,615
My handwriting blows.

338
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:12,119
Heh. A permission slip?
For what?

339
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:17,165
Okay, l haven't told this to anyone,
so you have to promise to keep it a secret.

340
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,126
Okay, promise.

341
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:24,715
lt's Mavericks. l mean, it's real.
Maybe the biggest wave in the world.

342
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,467
l've seen it with my own eyes,
it's right up the coast.

343
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,970
Frosty's gonna train me
to surf it.

344
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:32,806
Mavericks?
No one believes that.

345
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,309
l swear, it's like nothing
you've ever seen before.

346
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,144
And if l ask my mom
for permission...

347
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:41,398
...it'll just give her an excuse to act like my
mom for once and she'll probably say no.

348
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,235
You look great.

349
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,321
Thanks.

350
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:49,156
l would've asked you at school,
but l know you don't like...

351
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,908
...being seen in public
with younger men, so....

352
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,713
Hey, Blondie.

353
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:20,687
All right, fellas.

354
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,192
Come on,
race you to the pool.

355
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:36,370
You gotta keep 'em separated

356
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:38,538
Ow!

357
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:47,089
Yeah! Sick!

358
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:55,013
Get some!

359
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:59,476
Whoo! Yeah!
Aah!

360
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,520
Yeah, man, get up.

361
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:03,855
Yeah.
Hey.

362
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:06,400
Hollybra's having a party
tonight. You clowns going?

363
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:09,069
Yeah, sounds good to me.
Jay?

364
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,529
No, l got school and stuff.

365
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,406
Dude.

366
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,409
We all got school, dude. That's no excuse.
Heard that.

367
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,411
Haven't been to class all week.
Yeah.

368
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:20,664
The dude actually wonders why
he's a second-year sophomore!

369
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:24,835
So what kind of stuff
you got going?

370
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:28,088
Just trying to make sense
of everything.

371
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:30,090
We're in high school, dude.

372
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:33,010
Man, you disrespecting me?
Take him out

373
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,345
You gotta keep 'em separated

374
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,098
Hey, Frosty.

375
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,267
Hey.

376
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,814
lt's 20 to 4.

377
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:47,774
You told me to
be here at 4.

378
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,109
Exactly.

379
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:51,945
So, we ready to go?

380
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,572
Does it look like it?

381
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:59,578
Tell you what,
we'll be ready...

382
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,621
...when you clean up
that driveway.

383
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:04,791
That's what you get for
being 20 minutes early.

384
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,553
Deep breaths.

385
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,306
You got to stretch
out those lungs.

386
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:23,393
A wave like Mavericks will hold
you down for minutes at a time...

387
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,103
...while it pounds
you to a pulp.

388
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,730
lf you can't
hold your breath...

389
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,566
...for at least 4 minutes
under normal circumstances...

390
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,736
...then you may as well
not even paddle out.

391
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,166
How long was that?

392
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:51,838
You know what, l'm not even gonna
acknowledge that just happened.

393
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:13,568
Hey.

394
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,613
Where'd you find that?

395
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:21,409
ln the dresser that you
moved into the baby's room.

396
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:27,124
Hm. God, you're so beautiful.

397
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,793
Mm.

398
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:41,221
Look, um,
l know that surfing is...

399
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:44,724
...your passion and your life,
your escape.

400
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:46,476
l get it.

401
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,230
But l need you to
make me a promise.

402
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,942
And l'm serious this time.

403
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:00,907
That you're not gonna put
the rush of a 30-foot drop...

404
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:03,285
...in front of the future
of your 2 children.

405
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,754
l promise.

406
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:19,092
God, you're a good man.

407
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:22,762
Okay.

408
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,431
Jay's waiting for you.

409
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,441
Mom!

410
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,067
Mom, you got to get up
right now!

411
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:37,277
You got a 6:00 shift!

412
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:40,822
You're gonna lose
your job again! Mom!

413
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,574
Oh, no.

414
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,786
Mom, get up! Come on!
l'm getting up!

415
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:21,905
Hey.

416
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:27,160
You're 11 minutes late.
Yeah, sorry, Frosty. You know, my mom--

417
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,329
She had to write
my permission slip, so....

418
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,965
Your mother's got
nice handwriting.

419
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,759
She take much convincing?

420
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:46,346
No.

421
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,556
Not much.

422
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:50,600
Good.

423
00:37:58,484 --> 00:37:59,734
That your breakfast?

424
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,361
Hm? Yeah.

425
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:08,410
You want to be an athlete,
you got to eat like one. Take this.

426
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:13,123
Go on, take it.
You're gonna need it more than me.

427
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:15,709
Thanks.

428
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,877
Winds out of the south, southeast...

429
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:20,213
...at 15 knots,
gusting to 20 knots.

430
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,382
That's the Weather Radio, huh?

431
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,050
You use it to follow big surf?

432
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:26,011
Kind of like you timing the waves.

433
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:28,054
Only this thing's
a little more accurate.

434
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:41,234
There's no way
to paddle out there...

435
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,028
...especially with long boards.

436
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:45,864
Oh, there's a way, all right.

437
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:49,492
So let's see if you're
worth your salt, chief.

438
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,626
Okay, back to baking.

439
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,837
Let's go.

440
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:46,508
So you made it
all of 30 yards.

441
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:49,177
lf you want to get out there,
you got to make it...

442
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,304
...through more than half
a mile of this...

443
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,306
...just to get in position
of Mavericks.

444
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:57,143
So you've got to conserve
all the energy you've got.

445
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,896
All right.

446
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,315
Now let's take a look
at what you missed.

447
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,819
Now, for some reason,
you decided...

448
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:09,322
...to paddle straight out
into that mess.

449
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,325
Now, take a look
at the rocks over there.

450
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:15,120
See what's happening
with the current?

451
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:17,705
lt's got nowhere to go.

452
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:18,998
Nowhere to go but where?

453
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:24,170
Back out?
Exactly, back out.

454
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:25,672
To a waterman...

455
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,509
...it's a conveyor belt.

456
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,344
Watch this.

457
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:01,040
So today's lesson...

458
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:03,751
...was about the power
of observation.

459
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:06,379
Simple fact
is you got 2 choices.

460
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,298
You can fight
things head-on...

461
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,259
...or you can observe
the laws of nature.

462
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,553
Because if you
look hard enough...

463
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,597
...there's always
a way through it.

464
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:18,933
Make sense?
Yes, sir.

465
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:20,310
Good man.

466
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,229
Because you're going to
write me an essay about it.

467
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:27,233
3 pages,
typewritten, single-space.

468
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:31,070
Devil's in the details
of whatever you observe.

469
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:34,449
Time to start building
your mental pillar, chief.

470
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,958
Hey, Kimmy.

471
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:47,212
Oh, my gosh!
Are you okay?

472
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:48,421
Yeah.

473
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:50,048
Oh, man.

474
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:53,843
What are you doing?
Uh, l just got off work.

475
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,094
You?

476
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:57,347
Oh, um, l was just trying
to go for a swim...

477
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,474
...but l guess they close
early on Sundays.

478
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,267
You want to go swimming
at night...

479
00:42:01,435 --> 00:42:03,102
...you got to use
the back entrance.

480
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:06,564
Hey, this isn't so bad.

481
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:15,740
Okay, so how do we get down?

482
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:17,909
There's only one way l know of.

483
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:21,037
What? No.
Are you serious?

484
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,580
No.

485
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:24,165
Jay.
Hey.

486
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:28,169
l saw your bike.
You didn't tell me.

487
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:32,257
So she know the rules?

488
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:33,424
No.

489
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:35,009
Clear it. Clear it.
Excuse me.

490
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:36,761
lt's kind of like
figure skating.

491
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,680
Points based on a combination...

492
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:41,641
...of style, execution
and difficulty.

493
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:45,144
For example, l'm going to start
with a standing one and a half.

494
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:49,148
High, l repeat,
high level of difficulty.

495
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,985
Because l got to clear
the pool deck.

496
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:55,655
Hit that,
you're immediately DQ'd.

497
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,782
No. Wait, wait, wait.
You guys aren't serious.

498
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,450
Really? No!

499
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,330
Oh....
Oh!

500
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,166
And the judges say....

501
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:08,835
Oh, my gosh.
Nice one, Blondie.

502
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:12,088
The only thing that can top that
is a reverse back tuck.

503
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,173
Because of the blind entry.
No.

504
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:16,843
l can't watch this.
You have to.

505
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,219
You're the only judge.

506
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:20,763
No, Jay!
Whoo!

507
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:23,349
I wanna love somebody

508
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,603
I hear you need somebody to love

509
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,271
Whoo!

510
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:30,189
Look at this! Yeah!

511
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:35,862
I hear you're looking for someone to love

512
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:39,574
And the judge turned competitor
ties it with Moriarity.

513
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,242
No.
No, no, no!

514
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:43,202
To see who the real
champion will be...

515
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:46,456
...we're down to a final sprint. Whoo!

516
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:50,835
Back in the arms of a girlfriend

517
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:56,799
I didn't know nobody

518
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:01,220
And then I saw you coming my way

519
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:03,848
Ooh!
Hey, you cheater!

520
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,058
Ooh.
You are disqualified.

521
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:06,225
Why?

522
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:07,727
Because you pulled my ankle!

523
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,395
l would have won that!

524
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:10,772
Whatever.

525
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:16,986
40.

526
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:20,907
What are you doing?

527
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:24,410
4 pillars
of a solid human foundation.

528
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:26,746
50.
Mm-hm.

529
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,581
l made you coffee,
your clothes are in the dryer.

530
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:39,926
l'm swallowing water.

531
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,427
Well, you better grow gills.

532
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:43,888
You got 2 more minutes.

533
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:54,482
Yo, dude!

534
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,609
3 pages.

535
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:41,070
Congratulations.

536
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,906
You eaten?

537
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,673
lt's good.

538
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:13,311
Oh. Thank you.

539
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:15,062
You're welcome.

540
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:19,150
ls this some sort of a joke?

541
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:23,112
No, sir.

542
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,822
So l ask you to write an essay...

543
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:27,450
...and you observe a girl.

544
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:34,373
You never told me what to observe.
Oh, come on, Jay. Really?

545
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:38,795
l'm training you to survive
Mavericks, not some, uh...

546
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:40,838
...silly teen crush.
Roque, go to bed.

547
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,967
Good night, Daddy.

548
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:49,096
l just thought--
What did you think?

549
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:50,932
What did you think, Jay?

550
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:56,896
Nothing.
lf you didn't think, you're wasting my time.

551
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,064
Frosty.
Okay?

552
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,733
And that's not something
l got a lot of these days.

553
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:02,610
You know what?
lt's not your fault.

554
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:05,071
You're 15. You're just a kid.

555
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,241
Jay, um, will you
excuse us for a moment?

556
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:16,749
For heaven's sake, Frosty, not everyone
sees the world through your eyes.

557
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:20,044
Okay? He chose to examine something
that meant the world to him.

558
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,421
Something personal...

559
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:25,758
...which he opened up
and shared with you, entrusted...

560
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:27,093
...to you.

561
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,428
Brenda, l'm not concerned
with his feelings.

562
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:32,265
l'm concerned
with the objective.

563
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:35,226
The point of writing an essay
is to put your thoughts...

564
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,937
...down on paper
and see the gaps and reflect.

565
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:40,189
And did he accomplish that
or not?

566
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,946
l don't know. l--

567
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:51,450
My old man, he didn't even--
Shh, shh, shh.

568
00:47:58,333 --> 00:47:59,959
lt just takes patience.

569
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:02,420
You owe yourself that much.

570
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,797
Okay?

571
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:07,049
Okay.

572
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,011
l don't hear Lake.

573
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:17,852
Hey.

574
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,813
He just needed to be held, l think.

575
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:23,316
Don't we all sometimes?

576
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,699
All right, chief, sit down.

577
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:38,831
From now on, let's stick
to the subject at hand.

578
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:42,209
First off, l want you
to rewrite this essay...

579
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:45,338
...but you can observe
an actual break.

580
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:46,797
As in surf break.

581
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:49,342
Mr. Lopez.
Here.

582
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:51,510
Miss Mirkin.
Here.

583
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:53,095
Mr. Moriarity.

584
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:56,974
Mr. Moriarity.

585
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:15,826
Mavericks. November 10th, 9:13 a.m.

586
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:18,037
Swell westerly,
approximately 12 feet...

587
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:20,164
...at 16-second intervals...

588
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:24,961
...25 to 30-foot faces.

589
00:49:26,838 --> 00:49:29,465
One of Frosty's crew
heading out solo.

590
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:34,762
Looking like the best way out
is to ride the current inside the rocks.

591
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:39,350
Wind remains side-shore,
maybe 10 knots.

592
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:44,105
Set suddenly shifting
with no warning.

593
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:48,567
Large and northerly,
at least double the size.

594
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,746
Come on, come on.

595
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:38,511
Hey, man.
Hey, Brenda.

596
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:40,346
How's it going?
lt's good.

597
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:43,099
Yeah? l'm curious to hear
how it is from the one...

598
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,809
...on the other end of the whip.

599
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:47,144
You know, he's keeping me on my toes.

600
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:48,771
Not being too hard
on you, is he?

601
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:51,857
No. No, l feel like it's
the other way around, maybe.

602
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:54,318
How so?

603
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:59,240
Sometimes, when you've been
through a lot in life...

604
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:02,368
...you know, sometimes
you're hard on yourself.

605
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:06,455
That's the way it is with
my mom, at least, you know?

606
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,917
You sure you're only
in high school?

607
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:12,044
Yeah.

608
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:14,713
Bye.

609
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:18,342
See you.
See you guys. Take it easy.

610
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,896
Looks like your girlfriend is
keeping tabs on you.

611
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:32,898
Ha, ha.
Yo, who's that?

612
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:35,234
Oh, he's cool. All right, later.

613
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:42,074
What's this?

614
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:45,035
You my keeper
all of a sudden? Heh.

615
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:48,372
You having this conversation with me
or your conscience, Blond?

616
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:53,002
l just wanted to tell you,
it's your turn to lock up.

617
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,627
Jay?

618
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:52,853
Aah! Oh, my God.
1:46.

619
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:55,147
Almost 2 full minutes.

620
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:02,321
Jay, can l talk to you?

621
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:03,822
Uh, hold on.

622
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:11,330
Come in.

623
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:12,831
Hey.
Hey.

624
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:15,709
Hey, your uniform is, um....
lt's in the dryer.

625
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:18,671
Oh. Thank you. Thanks.
Okay.

626
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:21,924
Um, listen, l was wondering
if l could borrow $15.

627
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:24,927
l got a parking ticket, and...

628
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,680
...you know, if you
don't pay them, it's....

629
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,141
Yeah.

630
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:41,944
l'm gonna pay you back.

631
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:44,863
l promise.

632
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:47,741
Thanks.

633
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,810
Hey. You heading out, Blond?

634
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,562
Like you care.

635
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,522
Sonny!

636
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:20,399
Outside!

637
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,451
Ah!

638
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:36,582
Boy can get it done.

639
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:43,088
lf that's what you call snaking
someone's wave, man, you're right.

640
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:47,843
Guess we can't all be
as perfect as you, can we, Jay?

641
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:50,262
Blond, you're better than that.

642
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:53,891
All right? Let's go get some.

643
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:05,694
Mikey got with Sharon
Sharon got Cherise

644
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:09,073
She was sharin' Sharon's outlook
On the topic of disease

645
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:11,742
Mikey had a facial scar
And Bobby was a racist

646
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:15,120
They were all in love with dying
They were doing it in Texas

647
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:18,082
All in love with dying
They were drinking from a fountain

648
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:21,210
That was pouring like an avalanche
Coming down the mountain

649
00:56:21,378 --> 00:56:27,132
I don't mind the sun sometimes
The images it shows

650
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:32,971
I can taste you on my lips
And smell you in my clothes

651
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:38,977
Cinnamon and sugary
And softly spoken lies

652
00:56:39,145 --> 00:56:45,275
You never know just how to look
Through other people's eyes

653
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:08,757
I don't mind the sun sometimes
The images it shows

654
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:15,013
I can taste you on my lips
And smell you in my clothes

655
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:21,019
Cinnamon and sugary
And softly spoken lies

656
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:27,317
You never know just how you look
Through other people's eyes

657
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:19,077
Whoo!

658
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:20,746
Yeah!

659
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:52,653
Hey.

660
00:58:58,576 --> 00:59:00,077
You're back early.

661
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:01,745
What you doing?

662
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:05,123
You know, it's, uh--
He wanted to surprise you.

663
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,006
Well, he succeeded.

664
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:16,593
Carry on.

665
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:19,638
You're the worst! You're the worst!

666
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:24,351
Hey, did you see that big
outside set? lt was firing today!

667
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:30,440
Careful, man. He's wasted.

668
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:32,651
Uh, yeah, let me get a, um--

669
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:35,112
A hot dog, extra chili.

670
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,115
Ahem. No, check that.
Make it a jelly donut.

671
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:40,450
All we got is pizza, bro.

672
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:44,705
Hey, little trash...

673
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:47,291
...why are you always smiling
all the time, huh?

674
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:48,834
Oh, there you go again.

675
00:59:49,002 --> 00:59:51,503
You see, when you smile,
you look like a little wuss.

676
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:54,381
When you look like a little wuss,
you don't get no respect.

677
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:56,675
Sure got it today.

678
00:59:58,511 --> 01:00:01,513
Hey! Hey! Hey, get off!

679
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:07,519
Come on! Get off me, man!
You throw a punch...

680
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:10,522
...you better pray l don't make it
back up, you little punk.

681
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:14,526
Yeah, you think you're better
than the rest of us, don't you?

682
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:17,613
l see you paddling out there
every morning with Frosty.

683
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,656
Come on, man, let's get out of here.

684
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:22,826
Paddle, paddle, paddle, little grom.
Let's go, bro.

685
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:24,661
Let's get out of here.

686
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:33,003
Looks like you
dropped something.

687
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:48,226
l read your essay.

688
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:50,395
What do you think?

689
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:52,981
l think that's what l expected
from you all along.

690
01:00:57,111 --> 01:00:58,362
You done good, chief.

691
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:04,409
And now the lion sleeps.

692
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:08,580
The wave is gonna break behind us
where the reef falls...

693
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:11,541
...from about 40 feet
to about 1,500 feet.

694
01:01:11,709 --> 01:01:14,211
Here's what you want
to avoid: Firstly...

695
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:15,712
...see those rocks
over there?

696
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,130
They call that
the Boneyard.

697
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:19,966
Whatever you do,
do not let the current push you in there.

698
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:21,927
lt'll smash you to pieces.

699
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:26,515
So where do you set?
What you got to do is triangulate.

700
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:30,977
You draw a line between
yourself and that dish...

701
01:01:31,145 --> 01:01:33,980
...and that mushroom rock
over there.

702
01:01:34,148 --> 01:01:37,401
The biggest treachery of all
is what lies underneath.

703
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,162
Most waves break on reefs...

704
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:52,290
...less than 20 feet
beneath the surface.

705
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:55,085
Depth is doubled out here.

706
01:01:57,296 --> 01:02:00,298
Meaning, when it's firing,
you got twice the water mass...

707
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:01,883
...twice the wave energy...

708
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:06,012
...and twice the IikeIihood
of drowning.

709
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:56,229
Don't worry. l got your back, kid.

710
01:03:02,653 --> 01:03:04,488
What happened?
What do you mean?

711
01:03:04,655 --> 01:03:06,364
l just saw a 15-foot shark.

712
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:10,535
l'm sure it scared the piss out of you, but
that wasn't what l asked. Why'd you panic?

713
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:16,082
Just fear, l guess.
All right, well, one thing you got to know...

714
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:19,252
...fear and panic
are 2 separate emotions.

715
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:22,297
Fear is healthy, panic is deadly.

716
01:03:22,673 --> 01:03:24,883
Because when this
place is firing...

717
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:27,886
...and l'm talking
about 30, 40-foot waves...

718
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:32,599
...it's all about fear. But you panic
out there, like you just did...

719
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:33,809
...you die.

720
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:38,146
Well, if you're scared to death,
how do you not panic?

721
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:42,234
By identifying the fear
and what it is you're afraid of.

722
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:44,027
Not just out there, but in life.

723
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:47,989
Welcome to your next essay.

724
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:06,800
All right, guys, listen up.
Uh, homework assignment, okay?

725
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:09,427
Put your pencils down.
Don't write until l'm done.

726
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:12,264
Gotta listen first, okay?
Here we go.

727
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:15,183
Name the 4 sophila
of arthropods.

728
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:18,562
Which sophila is thought
to be the eldest?

729
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:22,107
Which sophila
is thought to be the eldest? Number one.

730
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:26,736
Number two: Compare complete
and incomplete metamor--

731
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:30,615
There he goes again.

732
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:44,629
Hey.
Hey.

733
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:47,757
l was hoping l'd see you here.

734
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:51,803
Um, we're doing a bonfire
down at the cove.

735
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:56,099
You want to stop by after work?
Oh, thanks. You know, but l got to....

736
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:58,226
Where's the action?

737
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:00,312
l want to party!

738
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:07,485
You know, come on.
l got a better idea.

739
01:05:07,653 --> 01:05:10,697
Yeah, okay, that's $14.56.

740
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:16,745
Dude, no. What?
l'll owe you forever, Blond.

741
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,788
What's up?
l promise.

742
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:25,837
Oh, hey.
Dude, you dropped your, uh....

743
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:46,775
Hey.
You're home.

744
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:49,819
Yeah, l finished up early,
so l thought l'd get back.

745
01:05:50,446 --> 01:05:54,574
ls Roque in her room?
Yeah, she's getting ready for bed.

746
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:57,452
What's in the bag?
Oh.

747
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:00,830
My old man used to read
to me as a kid...

748
01:06:00,998 --> 01:06:03,124
...and l thought...

749
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:04,334
...you know, maybe...

750
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:08,213
...maybe l would start
reading to Roque.

751
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:10,882
Okay.

752
01:06:18,182 --> 01:06:19,432
Roque?

753
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:21,017
Hi, Daddy.

754
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:24,604
l take it this isn't
your first time here.

755
01:06:24,772 --> 01:06:27,107
lt's my first time
with anyone else.

756
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:39,160
Look, you see that?

757
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:42,163
That's the seventh brightest
star in the sky, Rigel.

758
01:06:42,581 --> 01:06:45,750
Right above it, on either side,
that's Betelgeuse and Bellatrix.

759
01:06:45,918 --> 01:06:47,377
lt's the shoulders
of Orion.

760
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,632
What?
Ha, ha.

761
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,760
How'd you know that?
l learned it from my dad.

762
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:58,847
He started teaching me
about the stars...

763
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:01,808
...when l was maybe,
like, 3 or 4.

764
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:04,769
There are 88 constellations...

765
01:07:04,937 --> 01:07:07,605
...but l never got a chance
to learn them all.

766
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:17,115
Come on.

767
01:07:17,283 --> 01:07:18,783
Follow me.

768
01:07:20,494 --> 01:07:25,457
Fade into you

769
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,377
Whoa!

770
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:32,714
Strange you never knew

771
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:35,300
Paddle, paddle, paddle! Come on, Kimmy!

772
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,010
Yeah!

773
01:07:37,803 --> 01:07:39,637
Kimmy, give me your hand.
Get over here.

774
01:07:39,805 --> 01:07:42,223
Kimmy, come on. Come on.
Ha-ha-ha.

775
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:44,142
Ow!
No!

776
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:52,817
Fade into you

777
01:07:58,032 --> 01:07:59,532
Frost, l saw you were counting...

778
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:02,368
...on your fingers when we were
diving at Mavericks.

779
01:08:02,536 --> 01:08:05,830
The longer you're down there,
the more your mind unspools.

780
01:08:06,874 --> 01:08:09,209
You mark each minute
with a finger.

781
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:11,753
Run out of fingers...

782
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:13,254
...and you know
you're in trouble.

783
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:21,805
Feel the water getting colder?

784
01:08:22,348 --> 01:08:25,350
Yeah.
Because of what lies beneath us.

785
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:29,187
lt's the Monterey Trench,
5,280 feet deep.

786
01:08:29,355 --> 01:08:33,441
Current drops in here,
heads east until it hits the Southern Wall.

787
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:36,569
Creating what?
lt's a back eddy.

788
01:08:36,737 --> 01:08:40,573
You know, the day you hit that eddy is
the day you'll be more than halfway there.

789
01:08:40,991 --> 01:08:43,827
Where'd you learn all that stuff anyway?
From you.

790
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:46,329
l mean, from books and maps.

791
01:08:46,497 --> 01:08:50,041
You told me to study
the currents and the tides.

792
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:51,501
Yeah, l guess l did, didn't l?

793
01:08:55,881 --> 01:09:00,301
Used to come out here and just
paddle out to the deepest part.

794
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:03,930
Used to bob up and down
like a cork just....

795
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:06,141
Just to feel it.

796
01:09:09,061 --> 01:09:10,311
To feel what?

797
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:13,273
The abyss.

798
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:21,573
The tide is really strong today.

799
01:09:22,616 --> 01:09:25,827
That's because of
tropical hurricanes from Japan.

800
01:09:26,203 --> 01:09:29,747
Making their way across the Pacific.
Really?

801
01:09:29,915 --> 01:09:34,711
Only happens once
every seven to 10 years.

802
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:38,173
Last El Nino was '83.

803
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:39,591
Brought waves into Mavericks...

804
01:09:39,758 --> 01:09:43,261
...the size
of 5-story buildings.

805
01:09:44,471 --> 01:09:46,764
Oh, yeah.
El Nino.

806
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:49,225
Do you think it'll
happen again this year?

807
01:09:49,393 --> 01:09:51,102
l don't know.

808
01:09:52,062 --> 01:09:55,815
But if it does,
you'd better be ready.

809
01:09:56,483 --> 01:09:58,735
Because that wave of ours...

810
01:09:58,903 --> 01:10:00,945
...ain't gonna be
a secret anymore.

811
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:04,240
So, girl, I want you to know

812
01:10:04,408 --> 01:10:08,745
That wherever you go
I won't be far away

813
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:13,208
Because as I kiss your lips
While you swing your hips

814
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:17,670
You just see me say
She's my honey baby

815
01:10:17,838 --> 01:10:19,505
Yeah, yeah, yeah

816
01:10:22,801 --> 01:10:25,136
Nice.
Thank you, ladies.

817
01:10:26,513 --> 01:10:28,640
All right, l gotta
go get some wood.

818
01:10:28,807 --> 01:10:31,226
No.
l got to keep you ladies warm.

819
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:33,645
Why don't you go help Daddy?
Bye.

820
01:10:33,812 --> 01:10:36,105
Oh, no. You're leaving.
Yeah, swing shift calls.

821
01:10:36,273 --> 01:10:40,318
No. Oh, good to see you.

822
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:45,323
So, wait,
where did you guys meet?

823
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:46,574
You're looking at it.

824
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:47,909
Really?

825
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:50,536
Yeah. This is where we
went on our first date.

826
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:54,832
He asked me out to dinner,
and before l know it, he's...

827
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,710
...you know, spearing
a fish and cooking it...

828
01:10:57,878 --> 01:11:00,505
...over a campfire like
a caveman, and l'm just...

829
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:03,967
...sitting there in my white
taffeta dress and my pearls...

830
01:11:04,134 --> 01:11:06,552
...you know, wondering
where my cutlery is.

831
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:12,350
ls all of his family here?

832
01:11:12,518 --> 01:11:13,768
No, we're his only family.

833
01:11:14,853 --> 01:11:17,522
Frosty lost both his folks
when he was young.

834
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:21,234
He doesn't really talk about it much.
Kind of carries it on the inside.

835
01:11:22,069 --> 01:11:23,528
Always has.

836
01:11:24,488 --> 01:11:26,614
Somehow, it's just...

837
01:11:28,033 --> 01:11:31,369
...made him feel unfit. Heh.

838
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:34,163
l don't know. lt just--
lt breaks my heart.

839
01:11:41,630 --> 01:11:44,048
You take care of that boy,
you hear?

840
01:11:45,092 --> 01:11:46,968
Yeah, l will.
Okay.

841
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:48,803
l mean, we're just friends...

842
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:50,722
...but l'll take care of him.
Just friends?

843
01:11:50,889 --> 01:11:52,473
Hey, hey.
Wow. Nice catch!

844
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:54,809
Anybody want to kiss a fish?
Not me.

845
01:11:55,185 --> 01:11:57,145
Eh? Yeah.
No! No! Jay, no!

846
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:59,230
No! Do not get that
near me! No!

847
01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:00,898
No!

848
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:09,866
Hey.

849
01:12:10,868 --> 01:12:13,619
What's up? Hey. How are you?

850
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:32,638
Oh....

851
01:12:33,265 --> 01:12:34,640
Well, well.

852
01:12:34,808 --> 01:12:36,476
Glad you showed up.

853
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:39,228
We came to see
the Mavericks man.

854
01:12:42,274 --> 01:12:43,691
What are they doing here?

855
01:12:44,818 --> 01:12:46,611
What are you, like,
Neighborhood Watch?

856
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:50,406
So, what's the deal, little trash?
You gonna slay that dragon...

857
01:12:50,574 --> 01:12:53,076
...by yourself, or is your
rent-a-dad gonna help?

858
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:01,459
"From a distance,
l watched and realized...

859
01:13:01,627 --> 01:13:05,421
...that along with rare beauty
comes constant scrutiny.

860
01:13:05,589 --> 01:13:08,716
Like being the lead
in a school play."

861
01:13:12,262 --> 01:13:14,097
That's poetic, man.

862
01:13:16,642 --> 01:13:19,519
lt's a shame she laughs at you
behind your back, though.

863
01:13:19,686 --> 01:13:21,979
But, l mean, you already
knew that, right?

864
01:13:22,147 --> 01:13:24,857
lt's kind of obvious since
she won't be seen with you.

865
01:13:36,954 --> 01:13:40,331
Paddle, paddle, paddle,
little grom.

866
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:42,667
Paddle, paddle, paddle.

867
01:14:19,163 --> 01:14:20,746
l'm not doing it again.

868
01:14:22,916 --> 01:14:26,711
Okay, well, you know the deal.

869
01:14:27,045 --> 01:14:29,380
You want to walk,
that's your choice.

870
01:14:29,548 --> 01:14:32,842
Why are you doing this to me?
Because l want the truth.

871
01:14:34,011 --> 01:14:35,720
l want to know
what you're afraid of.

872
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:39,932
l don't know.
You don't know?

873
01:14:41,226 --> 01:14:43,561
Or you don't wanna know?
l don't know.

874
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:46,564
Well, you better ask yourself...

875
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:48,983
...what do you want
to leave behind?

876
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:52,904
The truth of who you really are
or just some words on a page?

877
01:14:53,238 --> 01:14:56,407
All that stuff that's burning
deep down inside of you, what is that?

878
01:14:57,618 --> 01:15:00,786
That stuff you can't even look at
because it scares you so much...

879
01:15:00,954 --> 01:15:02,830
...that the same thing
in that letter?

880
01:15:02,998 --> 01:15:04,916
That letter that you can't open--
Don't.

881
01:15:05,083 --> 01:15:06,542
But you can't even throw away.
Don't do this!

882
01:15:06,710 --> 01:15:11,422
Don't do what? lf you don't even have
the courage to open that letter...

883
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:13,341
...then how can you
take on that wave?

884
01:15:13,509 --> 01:15:16,427
Stop it! l don't know, okay?
l said l don't know.

885
01:15:20,807 --> 01:15:23,059
Dad, quick, Mommy's sick.

886
01:15:28,273 --> 01:15:29,440
Brenda.

887
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:30,942
Mommy?

888
01:15:31,985 --> 01:15:35,363
Jay. Call 911 .
l'm here, sweetheart.

889
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:37,406
l'm right here. Hurry.

890
01:15:37,574 --> 01:15:40,284
Mommy. Mommy!

891
01:15:40,452 --> 01:15:41,953
Yeah, yeah, we have an emergency.

892
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:43,204
Babe, l'm with you.

893
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:44,956
l need you to send an ambulance, please.

894
01:15:45,123 --> 01:15:46,874
Jay, tell them
she's having a stroke.

895
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:49,126
l think she's having
a stroke. She can't talk.

896
01:15:49,294 --> 01:15:50,378
Just breathe, baby.

897
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:52,838
l don't know. l don't know. She fell....
Mommy!

898
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:55,007
Mommy!
She's not moving.

899
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:58,469
Okay, babe. Baby, l got you.

900
01:15:58,637 --> 01:16:02,557
We're at 311 38th Street, in Pleasant Point.

901
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:30,376
Hi.

902
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:31,752
How could this happen?

903
01:16:35,757 --> 01:16:37,633
Jay, can we talk?

904
01:16:37,801 --> 01:16:39,635
Please?

905
01:16:40,512 --> 01:16:43,180
Are you okay?
No.

906
01:16:45,058 --> 01:16:46,517
l need to go.

907
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:48,019
Okay.

908
01:17:09,207 --> 01:17:10,833
Go away.

909
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:31,646
My grandchildren are wondering
where their father is.

910
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:36,067
No, they're wondering
where their mother is, sir.

911
01:17:36,902 --> 01:17:38,569
Then tell them.

912
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:42,073
l don't know what to say.
Tell them the truth.

913
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,909
She's at the side of God
in heaven.

914
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:50,456
Well, l'm not sure
l believe that right now.

915
01:17:57,130 --> 01:17:58,506
Maybe....

916
01:18:00,175 --> 01:18:02,677
Maybe we'll take the kids
for a couple of days.

917
01:18:06,431 --> 01:18:07,765
Yeah.

918
01:18:09,476 --> 01:18:12,061
Those 2 children
have lost their mother.

919
01:18:13,438 --> 01:18:16,357
Now, don't deny them
the comfort of their father.

920
01:18:17,401 --> 01:18:19,527
Now, come inside.

921
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:53,811
Why did he leave us, Mom?

922
01:19:01,111 --> 01:19:03,154
He didn't leave us.

923
01:19:03,321 --> 01:19:05,030
He left me.

924
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:18,794
Frosty?

925
01:19:20,672 --> 01:19:22,465
Frost.

926
01:19:22,632 --> 01:19:24,633
Hey, Frosty?

927
01:19:29,681 --> 01:19:31,932
Show Daddy the soft baby rabbit.

928
01:19:32,517 --> 01:19:33,726
Say, "Hi."

929
01:19:34,644 --> 01:19:36,145
Say, "I love you, Daddy."

930
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:41,192
Can you show Daddy?

931
01:19:41,359 --> 01:19:42,860
Show Daddy the soft baby rabbit.

932
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:45,029
Say, "Hi." Can you say,
"I love you, Daddy."

933
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:47,198
Frost?
Hi, Daddy.

934
01:19:47,365 --> 01:19:48,699
She said, "Da!"

935
01:19:48,867 --> 01:19:50,493
She said "Daddy."

936
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:52,036
That's good.

937
01:19:52,204 --> 01:19:55,372
Should we read a story to Daddy?
Should we read a story....

938
01:20:04,299 --> 01:20:05,549
Deep breaths.

939
01:20:05,717 --> 01:20:07,551
Steady rhythm.

940
01:20:07,719 --> 01:20:09,470
Drive and glide.

941
01:20:18,021 --> 01:20:20,022
Frosty!

942
01:20:28,865 --> 01:20:30,032
Deep breaths.

943
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:31,742
Steady rhythm.

944
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:33,410
Drive and glide.

945
01:20:35,747 --> 01:20:41,043
Frosty!

946
01:20:57,227 --> 01:20:59,728
The current.

947
01:20:59,896 --> 01:21:01,313
He floated with the current.

948
01:21:22,335 --> 01:21:24,044
Frosty, what are you doing?

949
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:27,631
What are you doing? You can't just
walk away from everything!

950
01:21:27,799 --> 01:21:31,135
Why not? Huh? Why not?

951
01:21:37,976 --> 01:21:40,311
She's all l had, Jay.

952
01:21:40,478 --> 01:21:42,438
She's all l ever knew.

953
01:21:44,482 --> 01:21:47,276
All l know, Frost,
is what you told me.

954
01:21:47,444 --> 01:21:50,279
lf you look hard enough,
there's always a way through it.

955
01:21:50,947 --> 01:21:52,907
But what if l don't
have the strength, Jay?

956
01:21:55,827 --> 01:21:57,661
Which pillar do l lean on then?

957
01:21:59,456 --> 01:22:00,497
The fifth one.

958
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:03,500
Which one is that?

959
01:22:04,336 --> 01:22:05,794
lt's me.

960
01:22:08,214 --> 01:22:10,257
Come on.

961
01:22:10,842 --> 01:22:12,718
That's enough of this.

962
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:15,930
Come on. lt's time to go.

963
01:22:17,974 --> 01:22:19,475
Hey, Jay.

964
01:22:19,643 --> 01:22:21,435
You're going the wrong way.

965
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:23,687
l felt the back eddy, Frost.

966
01:22:24,064 --> 01:22:26,065
That means we're more than
halfway across the bay.

967
01:22:26,232 --> 01:22:28,734
Closer to what's in front of us
than what's behind.

968
01:22:38,036 --> 01:22:39,536
Paddle, Frosty.

969
01:23:15,156 --> 01:23:16,573
Good morning.

970
01:23:19,744 --> 01:23:21,412
Did you forget what day it is?

971
01:23:24,582 --> 01:23:29,545
Oh. And this is all of the money
that l borrowed from you.

972
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:32,715
Plus some interest.

973
01:23:38,513 --> 01:23:40,139
Mom, where did you get this?

974
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:43,892
l was made the shift manager,
because l'm so punctual.

975
01:23:47,731 --> 01:23:50,524
All right. Open your present.

976
01:24:01,619 --> 01:24:05,372
Frosty said that you might be
needing that to follow the swells.

977
01:24:08,043 --> 01:24:11,879
And he said there is
a very big one coming.

978
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:14,798
lt was hard to figure out what
he was talking about, but...

979
01:24:14,966 --> 01:24:18,761
...they're calling it El Nino,
which means "the boy."

980
01:24:20,305 --> 01:24:23,557
You know that because you got a C
in Spanish. Heh.

981
01:24:24,476 --> 01:24:26,060
You knew about this
the whole time.

982
01:24:27,312 --> 01:24:31,899
Yeah. Frosty's no dummy,
and my handwriting is not that good.

983
01:24:44,412 --> 01:24:45,954
Happy birthday.

984
01:25:15,819 --> 01:25:18,195
Yes! Ha!

985
01:25:23,034 --> 01:25:25,410
Nice weather we're having,
eh, ladies?

986
01:25:25,578 --> 01:25:28,622
Hey. How's it going, Bob?
How you holding up?

987
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:30,624
Yeah, yeah. Good.

988
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:35,712
This is Jay.
Bob Pearson. Heard a lot about you, kid.

989
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:37,881
Thank you, sir.
Follow me.

990
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:40,676
How's it cooking?
Catching any waves?

991
01:25:40,844 --> 01:25:44,638
No, l'll never surf anymore. l'm making
too many boards for all you guys.

992
01:25:44,806 --> 01:25:47,391
That's the way l like to keep it.

993
01:25:52,730 --> 01:25:56,400
You want to slay a giant,
you need a sacred spear.

994
01:25:57,193 --> 01:25:59,695
Happy birthday, Jay.

995
01:26:03,241 --> 01:26:05,075
Can l...?

996
01:26:05,243 --> 01:26:06,869
Yeah. She's all yours.

997
01:26:20,967 --> 01:26:24,511
l don't know what to say.
Just stay low, go fast.

998
01:26:25,138 --> 01:26:26,263
Yeah. Yeah.

999
01:26:44,199 --> 01:26:46,325
There. There he is.

1000
01:26:57,462 --> 01:26:59,379
Yeah, he can take a beating.

1001
01:26:59,547 --> 01:27:01,506
But can he surf?

1002
01:27:01,674 --> 01:27:03,508
Like nothing
you've ever seen.

1003
01:27:06,304 --> 01:27:08,764
You ever seen anyone that
can tread water like that...

1004
01:27:08,932 --> 01:27:10,682
...for 45 minutes
without drowning?

1005
01:27:14,979 --> 01:27:16,730
He's got a point.

1006
01:27:18,024 --> 01:27:20,484
Good, l'll take that as
2 yeses.

1007
01:27:26,699 --> 01:27:29,284
Just make sure he doesn't
drop in on me, all right?

1008
01:27:31,204 --> 01:27:33,163
Strong El Nino induced winter storms...

1009
01:27:33,331 --> 01:27:35,207
...are queued up
in the Gulf of Alaska...

1010
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:37,584
...and progressing eastward
towards California.

1011
01:27:37,752 --> 01:27:41,338
The burst is producing 55-knot
winds and seas to 40 feet.

1012
01:27:41,506 --> 01:27:44,132
Large ocean swells
are expected to arrive...

1013
01:27:45,468 --> 01:27:47,844
...resulting in large breaking waves
with heights to 35 feet.

1014
01:27:56,062 --> 01:27:58,522
Hey. lt's pouring out there.

1015
01:28:03,069 --> 01:28:04,111
How you been?

1016
01:28:05,863 --> 01:28:06,863
Good.

1017
01:28:13,579 --> 01:28:15,539
Kim...

1018
01:28:16,165 --> 01:28:17,416
...what's wrong?

1019
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:21,878
We've been friends forever.
You don't have to do this. Just tell me.

1020
01:28:22,046 --> 01:28:25,340
lt's just complicated.

1021
01:28:25,508 --> 01:28:27,050
Not from where l'm sitting.

1022
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:31,346
That's because you only see
the good in everything.

1023
01:28:33,057 --> 01:28:34,641
Most of us spend
all of our time...

1024
01:28:34,809 --> 01:28:38,478
...dwelling on all the what ifs
and just looking for...

1025
01:28:38,646 --> 01:28:40,981
...all the reasons why things
could never work out.

1026
01:28:41,941 --> 01:28:43,650
And what if you're wrong?

1027
01:28:45,695 --> 01:28:48,905
Then you show up to a pizza parlor...

1028
01:28:49,073 --> 01:28:50,824
...late one night, in the rain.

1029
01:28:55,705 --> 01:28:59,333
Ever since we were
little kids, Jay...

1030
01:29:00,877 --> 01:29:04,629
...l've just had this feeling
deep down inside...

1031
01:29:06,591 --> 01:29:07,966
...that you're the one...

1032
01:29:08,926 --> 01:29:12,304
...and l'm gonna spend
the rest of my life with you.

1033
01:29:14,891 --> 01:29:16,266
What?

1034
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:19,603
What's wrong?

1035
01:30:47,150 --> 01:30:50,527
Be advised, there is
an extremely high surf advisory in effect.

1036
01:30:50,695 --> 01:30:52,988
Buoys reporting
32 feet at 18 seconds.

1037
01:30:57,493 --> 01:30:58,660
Hey.

1038
01:30:58,828 --> 01:31:02,581
Hey, Frosty, l just heard,
32 at 18.

1039
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:05,876
Okay.

1040
01:31:06,043 --> 01:31:08,003
Okay, l'll call Kim.

1041
01:31:14,969 --> 01:31:19,389
Are you sure you don't wanna come?
l just want you to come home.

1042
01:31:24,896 --> 01:31:26,938
You sure you got everything?

1043
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:30,400
Yeah.
All right, then.

1044
01:31:30,568 --> 01:31:31,776
Because of that...

1045
01:31:31,944 --> 01:31:35,405
...there'll be a lot of cowboys out there
today trying to prove themselves.

1046
01:31:36,199 --> 01:31:37,949
Some of them are gonna get hurt.

1047
01:31:38,117 --> 01:31:42,245
So keep your distance
and keep your focus, all right?

1048
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:52,672
So a swell with this much west...

1049
01:31:52,840 --> 01:31:54,382
...means sets will be shifting.

1050
01:31:56,219 --> 01:31:58,053
So you better be prepared.

1051
01:32:01,098 --> 01:32:04,476
Pull over. Pull over.

1052
01:32:36,968 --> 01:32:38,843
Let's keep you warm, okay?
Okay.

1053
01:32:39,011 --> 01:32:40,595
All right.

1054
01:32:46,686 --> 01:32:48,478
l'll catch up with you.

1055
01:32:50,147 --> 01:32:51,898
Hey.
Hey.

1056
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:55,277
Coast looks pretty scary.

1057
01:32:55,444 --> 01:32:57,612
Never seen it this big before.

1058
01:33:00,283 --> 01:33:02,492
l've been thinking
about a lot of things lately.

1059
01:33:03,578 --> 01:33:05,203
You taught me to surf.

1060
01:33:06,122 --> 01:33:07,664
l never thanked you for that.

1061
01:33:09,625 --> 01:33:11,293
l'll be watching you, man.

1062
01:33:23,973 --> 01:33:26,600
End of an innocence, my brother.

1063
01:33:32,023 --> 01:33:33,440
How you feeling, kid?

1064
01:33:33,608 --> 01:33:35,233
You ready?

1065
01:33:35,401 --> 01:33:37,736
Suit up.
We'll paddle out together.

1066
01:33:40,531 --> 01:33:42,449
What about you, Frost?

1067
01:33:44,994 --> 01:33:47,996
l made a promise
a long time ago, chief.

1068
01:33:59,258 --> 01:34:01,801
That isn't El Nino, boys.

1069
01:34:01,969 --> 01:34:03,970
That's El Jefe right there.

1070
01:34:07,808 --> 01:34:09,059
You gotta be kidding me.

1071
01:34:10,728 --> 01:34:13,063
lt's too big for the kid.

1072
01:34:22,782 --> 01:34:24,240
Jay, are you sure about this?

1073
01:34:24,950 --> 01:34:27,077
l mean, really, really sure?

1074
01:34:27,411 --> 01:34:28,745
Because l'm not.

1075
01:34:34,251 --> 01:34:35,460
l am.

1076
01:34:48,474 --> 01:34:52,060
l know what you're
gonna say, so don't.

1077
01:34:52,228 --> 01:34:54,062
That wasn't the deal.

1078
01:34:54,230 --> 01:34:55,271
Remember?

1079
01:34:55,898 --> 01:34:57,774
No questions, no arguing.

1080
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:08,326
l just wanted to tell you something
l should've told you long ago.

1081
01:35:09,787 --> 01:35:11,746
Which is, it doesn't matter.

1082
01:35:12,665 --> 01:35:16,793
Whether you decide to
paddle out or take that drop...

1083
01:35:18,462 --> 01:35:21,131
...l love you no matter what.

1084
01:35:27,722 --> 01:35:29,264
Frost.

1085
01:35:50,870 --> 01:35:52,370
Come on.

1086
01:36:33,204 --> 01:36:35,705
Hey, get us closer!

1087
01:36:35,873 --> 01:36:37,624
Closer!

1088
01:36:58,729 --> 01:36:59,979
Let's do it!

1089
01:37:00,147 --> 01:37:02,440
Whoo!
Go time!

1090
01:37:52,992 --> 01:37:54,284
Ah....

1091
01:38:05,921 --> 01:38:08,673
Get out of here!
Sets are shifting!

1092
01:38:08,841 --> 01:38:11,092
Swing wide! Outside!

1093
01:38:11,260 --> 01:38:12,802
Kid, paddle, paddle, paddle!

1094
01:38:16,599 --> 01:38:17,640
Go, go, go!

1095
01:38:30,613 --> 01:38:32,405
Get your boats out of here now!

1096
01:38:46,170 --> 01:38:47,837
Go, Jay, get out!

1097
01:38:48,005 --> 01:38:50,006
Paddle, paddle, paddle!

1098
01:39:03,979 --> 01:39:06,272
Somebody's gonna die out there.

1099
01:41:06,018 --> 01:41:09,604
He'll be okay, as long as
he can still climb up the leash.

1100
01:41:57,402 --> 01:42:14,502
Come on, Jay.

1101
01:42:32,521 --> 01:42:33,896
There he is!

1102
01:43:01,383 --> 01:43:03,092
Grab ahold!

1103
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:06,387
No, no, no! Give me my board!

1104
01:43:08,974 --> 01:43:10,850
You heard him!

1105
01:43:16,607 --> 01:43:18,107
Thanks.

1106
01:43:24,448 --> 01:43:25,823
Wait a minute. What's he doing?

1107
01:43:33,790 --> 01:43:36,209
He came to surf Mavericks.

1108
01:43:38,295 --> 01:43:41,255
Set it up, man. Set it up.

1109
01:43:41,423 --> 01:43:42,965
Take it.
l got it.

1110
01:43:43,133 --> 01:43:44,383
Thanks.

1111
01:43:45,052 --> 01:43:46,385
Hold on, hold on.

1112
01:43:47,679 --> 01:43:49,513
Got it?
Yeah.

1113
01:44:10,118 --> 01:44:12,828
Come on, man,
you don't have to surf it.

1114
01:44:12,996 --> 01:44:15,831
Came this far, you at least need to feel it.
No.

1115
01:44:17,292 --> 01:44:19,460
Think l've felt enough
for one day.

1116
01:44:25,592 --> 01:44:27,843
Kill it.

1117
01:44:37,396 --> 01:44:39,021
Dear Frosty....

1118
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:41,691
Truth is that I am afraid.

1119
01:44:42,609 --> 01:44:44,485
l'm afraid I'll never
see my dad again...

1120
01:44:44,653 --> 01:44:46,862
...and that my mom
will never find happiness.

1121
01:44:48,365 --> 01:44:49,865
I'm afraid of losing Kim...

1122
01:44:50,409 --> 01:44:52,326
...because she's
the love of my life.

1123
01:44:52,536 --> 01:44:54,787
And, of course,
I'm afraid of losing you.

1124
01:44:56,248 --> 01:44:58,374
I'm not sure what you think
fathers are supposed to be...

1125
01:44:58,542 --> 01:45:01,168
...but now I know
what they should be.

1126
01:45:06,633 --> 01:45:09,093
Glad to see you made it, kid.

1127
01:45:10,137 --> 01:45:11,721
I finally read my dad's letter...

1128
01:45:11,888 --> 01:45:14,515
...which was Iike
my last essay to you.

1129
01:45:14,683 --> 01:45:16,183
Just a bunch of words on a page.

1130
01:45:32,743 --> 01:45:34,160
This one's all you, charger.

1131
01:45:35,203 --> 01:45:36,537
I know this sounds strange...

1132
01:45:36,705 --> 01:45:39,749
...but I've always felt like
I wouldn't be around for very long...

1133
01:45:39,916 --> 01:45:42,293
...which is why
I want to take that drop.

1134
01:45:43,045 --> 01:45:45,171
Because once l Iook down
over the edge...

1135
01:45:45,339 --> 01:45:48,632
...and I catch it,
I'll become a part of it.

1136
01:45:49,343 --> 01:45:52,094
And in that moment,
I'll know that l'm alive.

1137
01:47:53,258 --> 01:47:55,092
Jay became famous that day...

1138
01:47:55,260 --> 01:47:56,677
...not for riding giants...

1139
01:47:56,845 --> 01:48:00,181
...but for the courage of a boy
who dared the impossible.

1140
01:48:00,724 --> 01:48:03,434
Over the years, he rose to
the peak of the surfing world...

1141
01:48:03,602 --> 01:48:06,645
...his prowess matched
only by his joy.

1142
01:48:07,189 --> 01:48:09,940
The true prince
amidst a sport of kings.

1143
01:48:10,108 --> 01:48:13,611
He married his chiIdhood sweetheart
and swore himself true.

1144
01:48:29,753 --> 01:48:31,754
As for the rest...

1145
01:48:35,592 --> 01:48:39,261
...all l will say is, the ones
who push the limits discover...

1146
01:48:41,306 --> 01:48:44,308
...the limits sometimes push back.

1147
01:49:27,894 --> 01:49:29,311
To Jay!

1148
01:49:37,028 --> 01:49:38,779
To Jay!

1149
01:49:39,823 --> 01:49:42,157
To Jay!

1150
01:49:43,493 --> 01:49:45,619
Yeah!

1151
01:49:59,175 --> 01:50:01,135
We all come from the sea...

1152
01:50:01,303 --> 01:50:04,305
...but we're not all of the sea.

1153
01:50:04,472 --> 01:50:07,891
Those of us who are,
we children of the tides...

1154
01:50:08,059 --> 01:50:11,604
...must return to it
again and again...

1155
01:50:11,771 --> 01:50:13,897
...until the day
we don't come back...

1156
01:50:14,065 --> 01:50:15,524
...leaving behind only that...

1157
01:50:15,692 --> 01:50:18,360
...which was touched
along the way.

1158
01:50:19,195 --> 01:50:21,447
You just got to appreciate everything.

1159
01:50:21,615 --> 01:50:25,492
Um, l think that's one of
the most important things in life...

1160
01:50:25,660 --> 01:50:27,536
...is just really appreciating it...

1161
01:50:27,704 --> 01:50:30,789
...because, you know,
we only get to do this once.

1162
01:50:30,957 --> 01:50:35,544
And it's not for a long time,
so enjoy it.

1163
01:50:36,713 --> 01:50:37,713
Yeah.

1164
01:50:47,724 --> 01:50:51,226
l need a lift, I need a shake

1165
01:50:51,394 --> 01:50:54,772
l need to find another chance
That I can take

1166
01:50:54,939 --> 01:50:58,400
I need a fight, I need an energy

1167
01:50:58,568 --> 01:51:01,904
I need something that will
Take me quickly

1168
01:51:02,072 --> 01:51:14,541
I gotta just let go, whoa

1169
01:51:17,587 --> 01:51:20,964
It's all that l know

1170
01:51:21,132 --> 01:51:24,551
It's all that l see

1171
01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:30,516
It's all that's been here
Controlling me

1172
01:51:31,726 --> 01:51:35,145
It's all that l know

1173
01:51:35,313 --> 01:51:42,277
It's all that l see

1174
01:51:48,284 --> 01:51:51,620
l need a lift, I need a shake

1175
01:51:51,788 --> 01:51:55,249
l need to find another chance
That I can take

1176
01:51:55,417 --> 01:51:58,752
I need a fight, I need an energy

1177
01:51:58,920 --> 01:52:02,297
I need something that will
Take me quickly

1178
01:52:02,465 --> 01:52:29,199
I gotta just let go, whoa

1179
01:52:29,367 --> 01:52:36,165
Whoa, I gotta just let go, whoa

1180
01:52:38,042 --> 01:52:57,853
I gotta just let go, whoa
