00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:38,601
This is Harvey Milk speaking
on Friday, November 18th.

2
00:02:39,973 --> 00:02:44,433
This is only to be played in the 
event of my death by assassination.

3
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:50,615
During one of my 
early campaigns,

4
00:02:50,684 --> 00:02:56,589
I began to open speeches with a line and 
it became kind of a signature.

5
00:02:57,257 --> 00:03:00,420
<i>My name is Harvey Milk</i>
<i>and I want to recruit you.</i>

00:03:00,494 --> 00:03:01,654
(ALL CHEERING)

7
00:03:02,195 --> 00:03:06,723
If I was speaking to a slightly 
hostile audience

8
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,861
or a mostly straight one, I might 
break the tension with a joke.

9
00:03:11,371 --> 00:03:13,771
I know. I know I'm not 
what you expected,

10
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,432
but I left my high heels at home.

11
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:16,771
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

12
00:03:18,945 --> 00:03:24,349
I fully realize that a person who 
stands for what I stand for,

13
00:03:24,417 --> 00:03:25,884
an activist, a gay activist.

14
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,748

<i>for someone who is insecure,</i>

15

<i>terrified, afraid</i>
<i>and disturbed themselves.</i>

16
00:03:35,028 --> 00:03:39,556
It's a very real
possibility you see,
because in San Francisco,

17
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:43,433
we have broken a dam
of major prejudice
in this country.

20

As President of the
Board of Supervisors,

21
00:03:53,413 --> 00:03:55,847
it's my duty to
make this announcement.

22
00:03:56,783 --> 00:04:00,617
Both Mayor Moscone and
Supervisor Harvey Milk

23
00:04:01,655 --> 00:04:03,885
have been shot and killed.

24

(PEOPLE EXCLAIMING)

25
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:11,988
I wish
I had time to explain
all the things that I did.

26
00:04:12,065 --> 00:04:15,000
Almost everything was done
with an eye on the gay
movement.

27
00:04:24,544 --> 00:04:26,034
HARVEY: Hey. Hey.

Today's my birthday.

32
00:04:35,121 --> 00:04:38,818
No, hey, actually
it is my birthday.
At midnight.

33
00:04:38,892 --> 00:04:39,950
Really?

34
00:04:40,794 --> 00:04:43,490
And, believe it or not,
I don't have any plans.

35
00:04:44,965 --> 00:04:47,433
Some people took
me out after work.

36
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:53,097
Hmm. And that would
be at, let me guess,
Ma Bell or AT&T.

you think is the cause of
all the evil in the world,

You left out bad breath.

You're not gonna let me
spend my birthday all
by myself, are you?

45
00:05:19,766 --> 00:05:21,165
Listen, Harvey,

46
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:24,460
you're pretty cute,

47
00:05:24,537 --> 00:05:26,505
but I don't
date guys over 40.

48

Well, then, this
is my lucky night.

Why is that?

50

I'm still 39.

You can't respond to just

It's too dangerous.

Hmm, now you tell me.

64
00:06:52,992 --> 00:06:54,721
The New York Police
are the toughest.

65
00:06:54,794 --> 00:06:56,523
They're arrogant
and they're everywhere.

I'll show you all
the cruising spots,

to be very careful,
little Scotty-san.

(CHUCKLES) Are you on
some uppers or something?

69

No. This is
just plain me.

70
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,869
And you're scared
of the cops?

71
00:07:09,676 --> 00:07:12,201
I'm just discreet.
I know a lot of people.

72
00:07:12,278 --> 00:07:14,178
If they see me,
I could lose my job.

Oh, you're one of those.

74
00:07:18,651 --> 00:07:22,747
Well, I think you need
to find a new scene.
Some new friends.

75
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,920
I need a change.
I know.

76
00:07:29,262 --> 00:07:30,889
Yeah, you're 40 now.

77
00:07:30,964 --> 00:07:31,953
Oh.

78
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,565
Forty years old
and I haven't done
a thing I'm proud of.

79
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,632
You keep eating this cake
and you're going to be
fat by the time you're 50.

Just a little shop

Not too much work.

118
00:10:26,739 --> 00:10:28,707
HARVEY: Yeah. Like,
you know, I would like

119
00:10:28,775 --> 00:10:32,677
to join the, what's it called,
The Eureka Valley Merchants
Association.

I'm not an interloper.

A Jew, perhaps, but I
hope you'll forgive that.

If you open
those doors,

the Merchants Association

your license.

Under what law?

125

Excuse me?

126
00:10:44,757 --> 00:10:47,817
There's man's law and
there's God's law in

SCOTT:
You know,
we pay taxes.

129

The San Francisco police
force is happy to
enforce either.

Have a good day.

HARVEY: We'll form our
own business association.

137
00:11:38,211 --> 00:11:40,406
We'll start with
the gay businesses.

138
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,382
We'll get the addresses of
every customer that comes in
the store for a roll of film

139
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:47,817
and we'll ask
them what they want,
what they need changed.

140
00:11:47,887 --> 00:11:51,050
We'll get some
money rolling in here.
Revitalize the neighborhood.

Can I come in now?

142
00:11:53,693 --> 00:11:55,285
One more minute.

143
00:11:57,597 --> 00:11:59,394
And I can go to
the neighborhood banks.

144
00:11:59,465 --> 00:12:01,365
They must have
some gay customers.

145
00:12:01,434 --> 00:12:05,097
Look, Harvey,
what's with all this
political activist crap?

146
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:07,731
I mean, I thought you
were a goddamn Republican.

147
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,741
I'm a businessman, Scott.

148
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:13,108
And businesses should be
good to their customers.

149
00:12:13,679 --> 00:12:15,977
Even if their
customers are gay.

150
00:12:16,049 --> 00:12:18,040
For God's sake,
it's San Francisco!

151
00:12:18,117 --> 00:12:20,950
SCOTT: Yeah.
Well, it's just like any
other city in the country.

152
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,544
They hate us.
Real surprise.

153
00:12:22,622 --> 00:12:25,455
We should have
at least one block
in one city, right?

154
00:12:25,525 --> 00:12:29,256
We start there and then
we'll take over the
neighborhood.

155
00:12:29,328 --> 00:12:30,659
Maybe.

156
00:12:31,964 --> 00:12:33,192

00:21:19,658 --> 00:21:22,786
But what I'm talking about
is that we can change Phoenix.

304
00:21:23,262 --> 00:21:25,457
But we have to
start with our street.

305
00:21:27,132 --> 00:21:32,229
Police abuse, rent control,
pot, parks, seniors issues.

306
00:21:32,304 --> 00:21:34,204
Good luck
with all that.

307
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,866
Good luck.

You know what I think,

gonna get somewhere
if you keep talking.

00:21:41,513 --> 00:21:43,743
No.
I think you should
do what you do well.

311
00:21:43,816 --> 00:21:45,340
You should
be a prick.

312
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:49,513
But come with us and be
a prick. Fight City Hall.
Fight the cops.

313
00:21:49,588 --> 00:21:52,113
Fight the people
that made you come
here to do what you do.

314
00:21:52,191 --> 00:21:55,058
Sorry, old man, I'm leaving
for Spain tomorrow. Europe.

all the gay money,
the real money,

318
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:12,775

behind Feinstein

and all
the straight candidates
they consider "gay-friendly.' '

320
00:22:14,446 --> 00:22:16,277
Who cares about
those old queens?

321
00:22:16,348 --> 00:22:17,474
JIM: Well, you need
them to get elected.

322
00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:20,347
Why isn't my campaign
manager leading this
meeting?

323

these so-called
gay leaders anyway?

326

Who appointed them?
What are you suggesting, Jim?

327
00:22:29,028 --> 00:22:31,223
That I go down there and
solicit their endorsement?

328

to help people on the streets.
Where are they?

00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,695
Yeah, I know, but...
You need an
endorsement, Harvey.

330
00:22:36,769 --> 00:22:38,031
Take this.

331
00:22:38,103 --> 00:22:39,400
Checking the exposure.

332

They're nice pictures.

Sort of.

They probably wrote it.
Look, think of it this way.

342

If they try to kill me,
I'll get the sympathy vote.

343
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,172
That might be
just the push we need.

344
00:23:17,242 --> 00:23:19,938
You think this is funny?
Look at it.

345
00:23:22,648 --> 00:23:23,910
It's a total joke.

346
00:23:23,982 --> 00:23:27,076
I mean,
it's got no rhythm,
no humor. It's insulting.

347
00:23:30,823 --> 00:23:31,847
Don't do that.

348
00:23:31,924 --> 00:23:33,551
No, if you put it away,
you put it in a drawer,

00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:35,593
it just gets
bigger and scarier.

We see it every day.
It can't get us.

Gonna spend

For something you're
not gonna even win?

(WATER SPLASHING)

361
00:24:04,223 --> 00:24:06,623
DAVID:
I worked for a financial
institution in New York.

362
00:24:06,692 --> 00:24:08,216
I was very discreet.

363
00:24:08,293 --> 00:24:10,352
One night I went to
the Metropolitan Opera,

364
00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:12,397
<i>II Trovatore,</i> Verdi.

365
00:24:12,464 --> 00:24:14,830
I was
sitting in a box,
next to my lover.

366
00:24:15,634 --> 00:24:18,398
Someone spotted us.
Next day I was fired.

367
00:24:19,738 --> 00:24:21,569
So I decided to do
something about it.

368
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,507
Came out here
to San Francisco,
I bought <i>The Advocate.</i>

369
00:24:24,943 --> 00:24:29,812
I use my money and my
influence, in very subtle and
quiet ways, to do what I can.

370
00:24:30,616 --> 00:24:32,379
So you
think that backing
straight candidates

371
00:24:32,451 --> 00:24:33,645
is the best
way to help us?

372
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:35,687
Yeah, if they're
friendly to our cause.

373
00:24:35,754 --> 00:24:37,688
Supervisor is
a citywide office.

374
00:24:37,756 --> 00:24:39,485
Political alliances
have to be built.

375
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:43,688
You can't just move here from
across the country and run
for that office.

376
00:24:43,762 --> 00:24:45,229
But I am running for office.

377
00:24:45,297 --> 00:24:46,594
I'm on the ballot.

378

I have the union rank

(CHUCKLES)

381
00:24:53,172 --> 00:24:56,107
Harvey, we're like
the Catholic church.

382
00:24:56,175 --> 00:24:59,702
We welcome converts, but
we don't make them Pope
the same day.

383
00:24:59,778 --> 00:25:01,871
HARVEY:
Why haven't
you run yet?

384
00:25:01,947 --> 00:25:04,916
Too early.
Especially from the Castro.

385
00:25:06,385 --> 00:25:07,818
What's wrong
with the Castro?

386

DAVID: Nobody works there.
It's all about sex and
drugs and more sex.

387
00:25:10,889 --> 00:25:13,187
David, we need one
of our own in office.

388
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:19,163
Harvey,
you can't demand
acceptance overnight.

389
00:25:19,231 --> 00:25:20,357
HARVEY: Why not?

390
00:25:20,432 --> 00:25:23,128
The more
"out" you make us,
the more you incite them.

391
00:25:23,202 --> 00:25:26,103
Harvey,
step back
and quiet down.

392
00:25:26,171 --> 00:25:28,332
You're suggesting
we should go back
in the closet?

393
00:25:28,407 --> 00:25:29,806
Is that what
you're saying?

394
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:32,844
I spent more years
in the closet than
I care to remember.

395
00:25:32,911 --> 00:25:34,538
Let's go, Scott.
SCOTT: Yeah.

396
00:25:34,613 --> 00:25:36,046
I don't need your
magazine's endorsement.

397
00:25:36,114 --> 00:25:39,208
And I'm not asking for
anyone's acceptance.
I don't have time.

398
00:25:39,785 --> 00:25:42,811
DAVID: For you,
politics is a game, a lark.

399
00:25:42,888 --> 00:25:45,721
It's like putting on
a rock festival
or staging a love-in.

400
00:25:45,791 --> 00:25:47,884
You're too old to be
a hippie, Harvey Milk.

401
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,895
I am not a candidate.
I am part of a movement.

402
00:25:50,963 --> 00:25:53,989
The movement
is the candidate.
There is a difference.

403
00:25:54,066 --> 00:25:56,000
You don't see it,
but I do.

404
00:25:58,136 --> 00:26:00,229
Sorry, I, uh,
pissed in the pool.

405
00:26:01,907 --> 00:26:07,004
So, on election day,
out of 32 candidates
vying for six seats,

406
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:10,378
<i>we came in tenth.</i>
<i>We lost.</i>

407

of my becoming the first

409
00:26:21,326 --> 00:26:23,351
<i>to be elected</i>
<i>to public office.</i>

410
00:26:24,496 --> 00:26:27,624
So we decided to
try it again in 1975.

411
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:31,493
<i>Only this time,</i>
<i>with a few adjustments.</i>

412

SCOTT: No.
No, not cute.
I hate the shoes.

413
00:26:37,676 --> 00:26:39,507
I hate the hair.
You're not fooling anybody.

414
00:26:39,578 --> 00:26:41,842
I'm not
gonna let those little
Pacific Heights biddies

415
00:26:41,914 --> 00:26:44,712
write me off anymore
because of a ponytail.
I like it.

416
00:26:44,783 --> 00:26:49,345
No more bathhouses,
no more pot, for me
and my little poo.

417
00:26:51,323 --> 00:26:52,654
Speak for yourself.
Come on.

418
00:26:52,724 --> 00:26:59,892
We ran and lost
the supervisor's race
for the second time in 1975,

419
00:26:59,965 --> 00:27:02,957
but with
more votes
than ever before.

420
00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:08,902
So in 1976,
against everyone's advice,

421
00:27:08,974 --> 00:27:12,171
<i>I really pissed off</i>
<i>the political power houses</i>

422
00:27:12,244 --> 00:27:15,304
<i>in the Democratic party</i>
<i>by running against</i>
<i>their man,</i>

423
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:18,975
<i>Art Agnos, who was part</i>
<i>of their political machine.</i>

424
00:27:19,051 --> 00:27:22,111
<i>And this time,</i>
<i>not for supervisor,</i>
<i>but for a bigger job,</i>

425
00:27:22,187 --> 00:27:23,984
<i>for the California</i>
<i>State Assembly.</i>

426
00:27:24,056 --> 00:27:27,321
I don't think that
State Assembly seats
should be the reward

427
00:27:27,392 --> 00:27:29,257
for service to the
Democratic party machine.

428
00:27:29,328 --> 00:27:31,922
Machines run on
oil and grease.
They're dirty.

429
00:27:32,464 --> 00:27:36,457
They're dehumanizing.
And they tend to be
entirely unresponsive

430
00:27:36,535 --> 00:27:39,561
to the needs of anybody,
but those of their operator.

431
00:27:40,005 --> 00:27:43,634
Mr. Milk, I've been
a social worker in

something, Mr. Agnos,
right here in the Castro,

435

He was stabbed 15 times.

The last

Why then does your

How long were
you a fireman, Dan?

906
00:58:15,205 --> 00:58:16,604
A couple of years.

907
00:58:16,673 --> 00:58:18,698
And you were a police
officer before that?

You got something
against cops, Harv?

909

No, no. They tend
to against me though.

910
00:58:22,913 --> 00:58:25,347
But firefighters,
they're the true heroes.

911
00:58:25,415 --> 00:58:28,179
They supported me
on my last campaign.
I fully support them.

912

Those are kids in there.
You're asking them to
lose their families.

If their families don't
love them for who they are,

then they should
lose them.

HARVEY:
What are you
working on, Dan?

1345
01:22:59,388 --> 01:23:00,855
If you have something
to discuss, Harvey,

1346
01:23:00,922 --> 01:23:04,153
you can have your aide make
an appointment with my aide.

1347
01:23:04,226 --> 01:23:07,252
Dan, I know you're upset
about the psychiatric center.

1348
01:23:09,231 --> 01:23:11,165
What else do you
have coming up?

1349
01:23:11,233 --> 01:23:12,962

something from me.

me to support the queers
against Prop 6, is that it?

1352
01:23:17,839 --> 01:23:20,330
We prefer the term gay, Dan.

1353
01:23:20,409 --> 01:23:24,368
Just as I'm sure you prefer
the term Irish-American
instead of mick.

1354
01:23:24,980 --> 01:23:28,575
Harvey, a society can't
exist without the family.

1355
01:23:28,650 --> 01:23:30,345
We're not against that.
You're not?

1357
01:23:32,254 --> 01:23:33,243
No.

we keep trying.

Dan, we both have

We can't do that.

No, you asked for something.

Introduce pay raises,
'cause I can't take care
of my family on our salaries.

going to say that.

you just gotta get out there.

relationships in my life.

1434
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:15,697
And three of them have
tried to commit suicide.
And that's my fault,

1435
01:28:15,770 --> 01:28:19,171
because I kept them hidden
and quiet, because I was
closeted and weak.

You see what I'm saying?
Yes.

Dan, look,
you made a decision.

You know,
you made the decision.
