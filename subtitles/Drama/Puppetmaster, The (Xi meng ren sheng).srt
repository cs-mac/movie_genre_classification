1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:06,120
I know that you're working hard so
I can go back to the way I was before.

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,540
<i>I don't want you to work so hard.</i>

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:10,760
<i>Can't you think of a way
to let yourself off?</i>

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:14,440
Even an abnormal woman
needs to be loved.

5
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,460
<i>Even though I'm hurting now,
as long as you're by my side</i>

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,440
<i>I'll have the strength to keep going.</i>

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,880
Flower vase, you lost your sense
of taste, not your sense of beauty!

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,160
I don't even know where my heart is.

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,040
<i>She wants you by her side.</i>

10
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:32,010
Now the number of people I have to
say sorry to has increased by one.

11
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:35,730
I just want stand behind Ah Jie
and silently protect him.

12
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:37,960
Today, we're going to do
some practical exercises

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:40,140
<i>to see if it'll help your sense of taste.</i>

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,680
<i>I should take care of these things</i>

15
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,100
<i>because this is the only way
I can pay her back.</i>

16
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,320
I want you to be the head chef
at my restaurant.

17
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,160
<i>If you want to have a stable life</i>

18
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,100
I think you should seriously
consider a partner like me.

19
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,010
I've already practiced for so many days.

20
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:59,890
Kai Qi, let Le Xuan take
a break this afternoon.

21
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:09,220

<i>[Love Myself or You]
Episode 19</i>

23
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,980
What are you so happy about?

24
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,780
Ah Jie agreed to go out with me later.

25
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,680
Oh, then I'll come along with Kai Qi.

26
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,640
- Why?
- Why?

27
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,360
Because I'm a family member of
the victim and Fallback Guy number one.

28
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,140
What are you talking about?

29
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,300
Let's go, Du Kai Qi.

30
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,730
Don't stretch yourself out this way.

31
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:04,680
Sometimes you need to forgive yourself.

32
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,380
Let's go.

33
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,480
Look over there!

34
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,600
Wait for me here. I'll go buy some.

35
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:40,600
I just wanted to say that
there's a lot of people there.

36
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,180
Wait a bit.

37
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,930
Thank you.

38
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,600
- Here, try some and see how it tastes.
- Thank you.

39
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:16,450
Sorry. It's fine if you
can't taste anything.

40
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:19,440
It's good to just cool down by eating it.

41
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,660
When did you go to France?

42
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,410
In high school.

43
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,410
Do you want to know when I went to France?

44
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,800
When?

45
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,130
In college.

46
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,540
Do you want to know what
my major was in college?

47
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,760
What was your major?

48
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,720
Culinary arts.

49
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,720
Kai Qi.

50
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,580
You have such bad luck.

51
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,160
What?

52
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,280
No matter what you're doing,
something is always not in your favor.

53
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,720
At least my cooking career has
been going very smoothly.

54
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,380
Oh, that's right.

55
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,810
Just look at Nobel.

56
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:27,820
The person he loved
didn't love him and died

57
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,620
so that's why he was so accomplished.

58
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,460
How about this?

59
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,480
Love and all that can go to hell.

60
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,200
Let's unite and make the restaurant
the headquarters for 'going to hell.'

61
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,661
We'll make big bucks
every year on

62
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:41,690
February 14 and July 7
(Chinese Valentine's Day).

63
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,100
What do you think?

64
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,970
- Nothing much.
- Ouch! It hurts! My hand!

65
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,800
If nothing much, then nothing much!
Let go! Let go!

66
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,520
You're even hitting me.

67
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,450
Fiona! (Shrek's wife)

68
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,730
Remember to tell me if you're tired.

69
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,100
Are you also this careful with Kai Qi?

70
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,740
What?

71
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,340
Are you afraid that she'd get
hurt or be uncomfortable

72
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,100
so you'd protect her from everything?

73
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,970
Kai Qi? Kai Qi doesn't need it.

74
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,650
The more I want to protect her,
the more constrained she'll feel.

75
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,530
The best way is to tell her directly

76
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:21,260
the thing you want is
a hundred meters ahead.

77
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,240
Hurry! Hurry and run!

78
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,340
Be careful.

79
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,440
I'll go wash my hands.

80
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,320
- Then I'll...
- It's okay!

81
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,730
I'll go by myself.

82
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:44,920
I'm going to go see if Le Xuan is okay.

83
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,420
Here's some water to rinse your hands with.

84
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,010
What are you daydreaming about?

85
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:14,240
Ah Jie isn't curious about me at all.

86
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,010
But he cares about you.

87
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:22,360
But I want him to care more about me.

88
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,490
Only caring is so serious.

89
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,300
He's so careful around me.

90
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,080
I don't know how to interact with him.

91
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:35,080
Du Kai Qi knows how to interact with him.

92
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,880
Hey! Whose brother are you?

93
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:45,740
Should I tell you the secret to succeed?

94
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,860
What is it?

95
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:52,280
You see, Fu Zi Jie likes
taking care of people.

96
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,380
But when he overdoes it,
Kai Qi pushes him away

97
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,260
and tells him 'step aside!'

98
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,610
Why don't you give it a try?

99
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,610
Ah Jie... step aside!

100
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:11,340
Otherwise, you should just be
patient about his friendliness.

101
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:14,040
Wasn't that the reason why you liked him?

102
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,380
Why is Le Xuan taking so long?

103
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,900
I'll go look for her.

104
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,250
It's raining.

105
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,040
Kai Qi.

106
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,520
Let's go over there to get out of the rain.

107
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,720
- What's wrong?
- Wait.

108
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,170
I lost my contacts.

109
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,650
Even if you find it now, you can't use it.

110
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,880
Since you can't see, just trust me.

111
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,850
Give me your hand.

112
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,890
<i>Trust that I will give you my hand
at your most critical times.</i>

113
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:09,040
<i>Whenever you need me, I'll be there.</i>

114
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,840
Hao Wei, what are you doing?

115
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,120
Since we're already soaked, let's
just run straight home, okay?

116
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,140
But Ah Jie...

117
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,240
He has hands and feet.
He can get home on his own.

118
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,410
- Let's go.
- Hao Wei!

119
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,900
- Le Xuan...
- Hao Wei...

120
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,180
You first.

121
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,900
Hao Wei said he left.

122
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,080
Le Xuan too.

123
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,110
It stopped raining.

124
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:34,010
Then let's go.

125
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:10,910
Du Kai Qi, give me a day.

126
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,280
Don't be Kai Qi for today.

127
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,880
I won't be Fu Zi Jie.

128
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,400
Let's go back to when you were
the secondary chef and I was the intern.

129
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,800
Okay?

130
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:34,590
For one day, can you not think about
other people and think only of me?

131
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:00,800
Intern, I can't see the path clearly.

132
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,200
Oui.

133
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:09,199
What are you laughing at?

134
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,119
Now you look more like the intern.

135
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:27,809
You have to wear this to look
more like the secondary chef.

136
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:29,909
You want to die?

137
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:40,149
Ah Jie! Ah Jie!

138
00:14:41,119 --> 00:14:43,299
What?

139
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:53,429
Ta-da! 2014's newest
Egyptian style intern uniform.

140
00:14:57,699 --> 00:15:00,629
I'll go try it on right now.

141
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:22,999
I'll cook today, so I'll
choose the ingredients.

142
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,399
When did we agree to have you cook?

143
00:15:27,329 --> 00:15:28,799
We were so compatible just now.

144
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:31,679
You were like this to me,
so I was like this to you.

145
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:34,549
So then you were like this.

146
00:15:34,549 --> 00:15:37,519
Who's compatible with you? Go away!

147
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,519
When I had just arrived in France, I
loved shopping at the big supermarkets.

148
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,399
While looking at the ingredients

149
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:46,599
I would recite the signs
to learn the vocabulary.

150
00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:53,639
Veal... veau, veau.

151
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:57,459
Butter... beurre, beurre.

152
00:15:57,459 --> 00:16:00,069
Rabbit - lapin.

153
00:16:00,069 --> 00:16:02,289
Rabbit?

154
00:16:02,289 --> 00:16:04,629
You know, French people
eating rabbit makes me...

155
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:06,289
Don't say anymore.

156
00:16:06,289 --> 00:16:09,349
Okay, let's not say anymore.

157
00:16:13,109 --> 00:16:17,479
I've always wanted to help
my girlfriend cook something

158
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:21,459
go across the Seine River with her

159
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:24,839
and then have a picnic
near the Eiffel Tower.

160
00:16:25,539 --> 00:16:31,759
Oh, so you want
a foreigner as a girlfriend?

161
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,759
Why do you always jump to
such weird conclusions?

162
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:39,537
Although the Eiffel Tower
was constructed to celebrate

163
00:16:39,537 --> 00:16:41,909
the centennial of the
French Revolution.

164
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:47,879
the architect Eiffel made it
as a memorial for his wife.

165
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:52,479
Don't you think using steel
to make a landmark

166
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,829
gives an unswerving kind of feeling?

167
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:57,489
Oh please.

168
00:16:57,489 --> 00:17:01,729
If you don't use steel to make an iron
tower, what else would you use?

169
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:06,799
You are a woman without
a single romantic cell in you.

170
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,449
Can you eat romance?

171
00:17:08,449 --> 00:17:11,559
If it's edible, I can cultivate some.

172
00:17:13,169 --> 00:17:16,119
Leave! Leave! I don't
want to see you. Move aside.

173
00:17:25,829 --> 00:17:28,289
<i>Having a picnic underneath the Eiffel Tower</i>

174
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:31,169
<i>her eating what I cooked</i>

175
00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:34,579
<i>getting a friendly compliment or two</i>

176
00:17:34,579 --> 00:17:38,919
<i>having Mom, Dad,
and Zi Xiang there with us</i>

177
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:40,999
<i>and everyone smiling.</i>

178
00:17:40,999 --> 00:17:46,259
<i>And then Mom would say, 'Ah Jie,
we're finally seeing you truly happy.'</i>

179
00:17:46,259 --> 00:17:51,259
<i>That would be such happiness.</i>

180
00:18:05,379 --> 00:18:08,289
Yeah! Time to dig in!

181
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:10,209
Wait.

182
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,549
What is this?

183
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:22,579
Love is stronger than gold.

184
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:24,879
I just bought it.

185
00:18:28,449 --> 00:18:31,459
Aren't you being a little ridiculous?

186
00:18:34,449 --> 00:18:35,999
Let's dig in then.

187
00:18:35,999 --> 00:18:37,589
Not yet.

188
00:18:37,589 --> 00:18:39,539
What now?

189
00:18:40,439 --> 00:18:43,359
You have to give me two compliments.

190
00:18:50,289 --> 00:18:52,079
Okay.

191
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,759
Awesome! So amazing! Two compliments.

192
00:18:58,849 --> 00:19:00,479
Aren't you being too stingy?

193
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:03,359
You were the one
who said two compliments.

194
00:19:07,509 --> 00:19:11,959
Okay, fine.
I'm the luckiest guy in the world.

195
00:19:24,819 --> 00:19:26,719
Dig in.

196
00:19:37,199 --> 00:19:39,989
- How is it?
- It's good.

197
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:42,839
That's good then.

198
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:44,679
What are you smiling about?

199
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:47,029
I'm really happy.

200
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:53,279
So full.

201
00:20:00,739 --> 00:20:02,549
Ah Jie.

202
00:20:04,209 --> 00:20:06,899
Can you promise me something?

203
00:20:06,899 --> 00:20:08,839
What?

204
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:15,039
After today

205
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,909
don't be like this anymore, okay?

206
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,959
Don't come when Le Xuan
and I are doing special trainings.

207
00:20:26,769 --> 00:20:31,239
Don't make excuses, like you did today.

208
00:20:35,249 --> 00:20:37,649
Starting tomorrow

209
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:41,319
just treat me

210
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:46,319
like a friend that you'd
greet on the streets.

211
00:20:48,369 --> 00:20:55,159
Nanny's daughter,
Secondary Chef, and all that...

212
00:20:57,989 --> 00:21:00,719
Forget about all of that.

213
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:03,029
I don't want to.

214
00:21:07,829 --> 00:21:10,719
Le Xuan still hasn't recovered.

215
00:21:11,509 --> 00:21:15,089
We don't know when
your brother will wake up.

216
00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:20,439
I can't bear the burden of too much hope.

217
00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:24,759
Then what about me?

218
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:28,849
Because you can't bear it,
I should be alone?

219
00:21:41,199 --> 00:21:44,929
Why can't I be unruly
and selfish for once?

220
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:47,239
So what if someone else cries?

221
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:49,809
I have the right to be happy.

222
00:21:50,879 --> 00:21:54,369
From now on, I'm only going
to care about my own feelings.

223
00:21:54,369 --> 00:21:57,479
I'll do whatever I want.

224
00:21:57,479 --> 00:22:01,039
If I want to see you,
I'll come and see you.

225
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:05,039
If I want to get close to you,
I'll get close to you.

226
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:12,039
You're not someone who can be selfish.

227
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:15,959
It's your nature to treat others well.

228
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,529
When you do something wrong to others

229
00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:25,349
you get extremely stressed.

230
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:30,019
You already feel so guilty about
what happened with your brother.

231
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:35,539
Now, we're adding
Le Xuan on top of that.

232
00:22:35,539 --> 00:22:39,939
As soon as there's
some hope, it dies out.

233
00:22:40,849 --> 00:22:45,189
I really don't want to
feel this way anymore.

234
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:51,829
So after today

235
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:55,569
let's just be regular friends.

236
00:22:55,569 --> 00:22:58,389
Let's not contact each other too often.

237
00:22:58,389 --> 00:23:00,979
Let's not meet each other too often.

238
00:23:03,409 --> 00:23:05,509
I don't want to.

239
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:08,419
Ah Jie.

240
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,189
I don't agree.

241
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:13,699
Why should I listen to you?

242
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,169
Let's have a contest.

243
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:26,839
If I win, you can't say things like

244
00:23:26,839 --> 00:23:30,359
'starting tomorrow, forget everything.'

245
00:23:33,489 --> 00:23:35,909
Fine. What kind of contest?

246
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,910
I don't agree.

247
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:13,230
Why should I listen to you?

248
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,940
Let's have a contest.

249
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:26,570
If I win, you can't say things like

250
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:29,830
'starting tomorrow, forget everything.'

251
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,010
Fine. What kind of contest?

252
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,740
A brawn contest.

253
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:57,280
Get ready.

254
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:01,190
Start.

255
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:25,240
I won.

256
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,730
- But...
- Ah Jie.

257
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:32,590
Stop being unruly.

258
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:42,940
At least today isn't over yet.

259
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:48,650
Just for today

260
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:52,570
let me continue to be unruly.

261
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,480
Du Kai Qi, you're so slow.

262
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,000
Who's slow?

263
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,630
Tortoise, hurry up.

264
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:01,510
The tortoise beat
the hare in the end, okay?

265
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:04,710
Oh please! The hare
didn't give it its all, okay?

266
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:08,870
I'm not trying to brag, but my nickname
in high school was Leaping Hare.

267
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:12,380
My nickname was
The Tortoise Who Smashed The Hare.

268
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:14,590
What's that?

269
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,940
I don't know either.

270
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:24,440
Oh yeah, you and Cheng Hao Wei...

271
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,860
Are friends.

272
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:32,380
Then why do I always see you guys together,
discussing things and eating together?

273
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:35,690
Because I still haven't
paid back what I owe him.

274
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,140
- What do you owe him?
- Money. What else?

275
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:48,090
Now I really wish that
you owe me money too.

276
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:51,910
Then I could go see you every month.

277
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:57,830
Du Kai Qi, you have to pay up this month.

278
00:26:57,830 --> 00:27:01,210
What are you going to
pay me with this month?

279
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:04,070
Such an unscrupulous businessman!

280
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,890
Whoever smiles first loses.

281
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:13,000
Today, I'll teach you
the meaning of 'poker face.'

282
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,280
Du Kai Qi, you are despicable.

283
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:38,910
Fine. Do you want to play a fiercer game?

284
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:43,430
Do I look like I'd tremble at that?

285
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:47,500
Wait for me. I'll be right back.

286
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,800
There's just one rule in this game.

287
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:59,130
Whoever has the shortest
stick remaining wins.

288
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:02,090
Simple.

289
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:10,630
Aren't we supposed to be using hands?

290
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:19,580
Who's afraid? Come at me.

291
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:40,390
What? Are you scared now?

292
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:43,350
You haven't seen what I can do yet.

293
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:19,100
You lost.

294
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:22,330
There's none left.

295
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:25,290
This is the best result
of the game. Yay! I win!

296
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:26,780
- You!
- Yay!

297
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:31,780
What?

298
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:50,460
It would be great if morning never came.

299
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:58,910
Since it's not morning yet,
can I ask you for a favor?

300
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,770
What?

301
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:07,510
Can you pat my head

302
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:11,190
and tell me that I did well?

303
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:14,590
Can you?

304
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:22,470
Because I've never
thrown a tantrum before.

305
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,740
I always thought that it would be great

306
00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:32,740
if the person I like could
do that for me one day.

307
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:48,510
You did very well, Du Kai Qi.

308
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,990
You did really well.

309
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,550
I'm going to work at
Hao Wei's restaurant.

310
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,540
This is?

311
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:38,110
Soy sauce, mustard, and wine vinegar.

312
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,770
Now tell me the proportions.

313
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:45,930
<i>Why does Ah Jie have such
different attitudes towards us?</i>

314
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:48,460
<i>Is it because Kai Qi is more independent?</i>

315
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,890
<i>But I'm not that dependent.</i>

316
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:55,070
<i>Could it be that Ah Jie finds it cute
that Kai Qi tries to be brave?</i>

317
00:31:55,070 --> 00:32:00,070
<i>Huh? Du Kai Qi... cute?</i>

318
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:05,070
Cheng Le Xuan! Proportions!

319
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:07,160
Proportions.

320
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:14,870
He's so careful around me.
I don't know how to interact with him.

321
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:18,220
Du Kai Qi knows how to interact with him.

322
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:23,220
What do you like about Ah Jie?

323
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:31,240
What is he to you?

324
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:34,360
We've known each other
for so long at the restaurant.

325
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,950
You've never gotten close to anyone.

326
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:41,950
How did Ah Jie get so close
to you in just one month?

327
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:47,500
Because he's brazen.

328
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,500
You won't do it unless I tell you?

329
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,940
Ah Jie

330
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:16,670
is like the sun.

331
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:19,390
Even if you want to reject it

332
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:22,410
you'll still feel its warmth.

333
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:27,500
I used to think that

334
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:31,270
<i>it was fine living on my own
and depending on myself.</i>

335
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:35,960
<i>But Ah Jie thought of himself
as my childhood sweetheart.</i>

336
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:40,520
He'd always show up by my side.

337
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:46,090
At that time, my nephew
came to live with me.

338
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:48,270
I was at my wits' end

339
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:51,210
because I've never taken
care of kids before.

340
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:53,820
Ah Jie was very patient.

341
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,910
He'll smile and keep you company.

342
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:58,870
He'll listen to you.

343
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:02,220
He'll appear when you need him.

344
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:07,220
Because of him, I learned
to get along with others.

345
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:13,710
What I used to think of
as my responsibility

346
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:20,040
slowly became a relationship
that I couldn't live without.

347
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:25,530
He made me realize that
compared to living alone

348
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:30,330
living with another has its benefits.

349
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:33,740
Having someone to share your happiness with

350
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,230
and being happy on your own

351
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,440
are both forms of happiness.

352
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:43,190
But I feel very at ease when I see him.

353
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:46,310
It's like the whole world gets brighter.

354
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:53,190
Living isn't stressful
and isn't a heavy burden

355
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:58,460
but a happiness worth looking forward to.

356
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:12,220
At ease? You don't feel nervous at all?

357
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,010
Why should I feel nervous?

358
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:19,100
It's great to be able to
interact freely and effortlessly.

359
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:24,750
But don't you always want
to show him the best of you?

360
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:26,810
How long can you keep that up?

361
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:31,810
The real you isn't only the best of you.

362
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:36,120
If he's able to tolerate you even
when you look your worst

363
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:40,190
that's how you can keep a relationship.

364
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:45,850
Flower vase, you lost your sense
of taste, not your sense of beauty!

365
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:48,220
No! Where's your house?

366
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:51,880
Do you know how much Flower Vases
boosted others' morale?

367
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,870
And yet you made yourself like this.

368
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:57,770
In any case

369
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:01,270
Ah Jie and I are a thing of the past.

370
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:05,420
You must be tired from
practicing all morning.

371
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:07,390
Rest and eat something.

372
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:10,040
I'll come back later.

373
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:30,310
Le Xuan.

374
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:32,090
Ah Jie, you're here.

375
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:34,570
Kai Qi just left. Did you see her?

376
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:36,510
No.

377
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:44,630
This is what Kai Qi made
you practice with today?

378
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,340
Guess what this is.

379
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,570
What is it?

380
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:54,390
This thing is a lot of fun. Look.

381
00:36:54,390 --> 00:36:56,090
This is rouge.

382
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:58,700
This is lip balm.

383
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,080
And this is foundation.

384
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,720
It's very unique.

385
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:06,790
Of course. I thought of these.

386
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,910
Have you eaten yet? Let's eat together.

387
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,930
Okay.

388
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,530
You're here to see Le Xuan?

389
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:24,680
Yes, we just ate together.

390
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,790
You treat Le Xuan really well.

391
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:28,780
You don't hold back on the care
you should be showing.

392
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:32,670
And you are stingy with the gentleness
you shouldn't be showing.

393
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,830
Hao Wei.

394
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,860
You're treating my sister so well so that

395
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:41,450
she can turn her frustration
from losing her sense of taste

396
00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:44,070
into a dependence on you.

397
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,750
But if this continues

398
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:51,880
do you really think this is a
good thing for you or Le Xuan?

399
00:37:55,500 --> 00:38:00,500
I don't know what else I can do
except to treat Le Xuan well.

400
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:11,660
<i>Ah Jie treating me well is only
because I lost my sense of taste.</i>

401
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:15,180
<i>He feels guilty.</i>

402
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:18,860
<i>There has never been anything else.</i>

403
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:25,180
Ah Jie.

404
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:29,030
You forgot your cell phone.

405
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:31,500
Thank you.

406
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,760
Did you know that tomorrow is my birthday?

407
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,290
I didn't know.

408
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:41,430
Well now you do. Will you
celebrate my birthday with me?

409
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:45,580
Okay, then it's settled.

410
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:50,200
I want to celebrate at the restaurant
tomorrow night. Is that okay?

411
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,550
Yes.

412
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:54,150
Thank you.

413
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:56,520
Then I'll get going now.

414
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,220
Bye bye.

415
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:09,770
Cheng Le Xuan, what are you doing?

416
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:15,310
Is this Kai Qi?
Don't come over this afternoon.

417
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:17,790
I need to go research something.

418
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:19,990
I want to practice at
the restaurant tomorrow.

419
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:21,670
It'll be like a mid-term exam.

420
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:24,570
If I do well, I'll be more
confident to continue.

421
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:28,360
Okay, see you tomorrow.

422
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:33,710
Cheng Le Xuan, what are you trying to do,
bringing them together at the restaurant?

423
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:41,560
I want to take a gamble with my love.

424
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,330
Is this your birthday feast? Not bad.

425
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:01,080
Seems like you've gotten back eighty
percent of your chef's attitude.

426
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,320
You've definitely improved.

427
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:10,410
Ah Jie, help me taste this.

428
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:17,130
How is it?

429
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:20,300
The mint taste is strong and
the butter taste isn't too strong.

430
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:22,350
Eighty points.

431
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:27,350
You've been so kind to me.

432
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,680
I should. You're a good girl.

433
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,950
Everyone should be kind to you.

434
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:45,740
Weird. Why are the lights on?

435
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:52,780
What? Don't just suddenly
shout at someone from behind!

436
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:55,480
Do you want to scare someone to death?

437
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:00,640
Isn't it a holiday for everyone at the
restaurant today? Why are you here?

438
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:03,660
The restaurant seems to
be missing money lately.

439
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:07,790
I suspect there's a thief,
so I came to look at the security cameras.

440
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:10,000
Thief?

441
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:14,320
Even though it's a holiday,
I still worry about the restaurant.

442
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:18,010
You must tell General Manager
that I'm a model employee.

443
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:20,940
Who should I tell?

444
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:25,560
Oh right! I forgot that you
and General Manager already...

445
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:29,980
Then what's an ex-employee doing here?

446
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:32,190
Don't tell me you're...

447
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:34,990
I'm here for Le Xuan's
cooking mid-term exam.

448
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:37,210
Le Xuan? Just you two?

449
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:39,390
What else?

450
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:45,850
Chief, why are you here?

451
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,790
Hi.

452
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:52,990
Didn't you say there would
just be the two of you?

453
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:58,110
I'm the only one hurt.

454
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,640
You guys continue what you were doing.

455
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,560
Chief, I...

456
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,640
The soup is fine.

457
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,900
The thyme taste on the roast
chicken is a bit strong.

458
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:50,010
It's stronger than the taste of
the chicken's natural sweetness.

459
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:53,310
The mint paste for the lamb chop is not bad

460
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:57,960
but the lamp chop wasn't sautéed
in the white wine for long enough

461
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:02,280
so it doesn't harmonize
well with the mint paste.

462
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,530
We'll talk about the mid-term exam later.

463
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:09,790
Today is my birthday.

464
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:27,850
Happy birthday.

465
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:29,930
Thank you.

466
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,150
Kai Qi.

467
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,360
Can I also get a birthday present from you?

468
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:55,870
- What present?
- Answer a question.

469
00:44:57,550 --> 00:44:59,960
What question?

470
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:04,830
You and Ah Jie being together

471
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:09,240
is no longer possible, right?

472
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:26,330
Ah Jie, you think so too, right?

473
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:35,470
- Let's not talk about this right now.
- But I want to.

474
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,920
If you guys can't be together

475
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:50,880
then I will confess
my feelings for Ah Jie.

476
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:01,150
Kai Qi.

477
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:04,990
Can I?

478
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:12,010
What does this have to do with me?

479
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:14,830
You should ask him.

480
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:16,920
Du Kai Qi!

481
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:22,750
Ah Jie, can I like you?

482
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:28,190
My answer is still the same as before.

483
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:31,630
But I still feel the same way
about you as before.

484
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:34,940
- Le Xuan.
- I like you! I like you!

485
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:37,130
I like you!

486
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:22,480
Le Xuan.

487
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,630
Don't be like this.

488
00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:50,400
Cheng Le Xuan!

489
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:43,040
Give it up, Ji Yong Qian.

490
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,350
She's getting along really well with
the general manager right now.

491
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:53,040
- Le Xuan?
- I'm an idiot!

492
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:56,350
What happened?

493
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:03,440
I wanted to test Ah Jie.

494
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,640
So I told Kai Qi to come here too.

495
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,400
I know that Ah Jie loved Kai Qi.

496
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,830
I thought that

497
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:20,040
if I stayed by his side long enough

498
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:25,040
he would come to like me too.

499
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:30,160
But the longer I stay by his side

500
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,680
the more he hides his feelings.

501
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:37,950
So I decided to go all out.

502
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:41,530
I wanted to force his true feelings out.

503
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,570
Le Xuan, are you okay?

504
00:49:46,570 --> 00:49:49,120
I don't want him to see me like this.

505
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:51,740
What should I do, Chief?

506
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:16,320
Is Le Xuan okay?

507
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:20,000
I don't know. She won't come out.

508
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,500
Just now, you shouldn't have...

509
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,740
You know how I feel

510
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:27,640
so don't say anything
that will make me angry.

511
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:35,320
Le Xuan.

512
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:40,140
General Manager, Le Xuan's
legs suddenly gave out.

513
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:42,490
Conveniently, my mom is a doctor,
she can take a look at her.

514
00:50:42,490 --> 00:50:44,560
So I'm going to take her home.

515
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:46,830
- I'll go too.
- No need.

516
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:50,110
General Manager, please
close the doors later.

517
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:53,360
I'll take care of Le Xuan.
Please don't worry.

518
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,800
What's that noise?

519
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,950
It can't be the thief that
Chief was talking about!

520
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:27,530
What thief?

521
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:30,080
I'll go take a look.

522
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:33,240
Du Kai Qi!

523
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:38,240
Du Kai Qi!

524
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,480
Du Kai Qi!

525
00:53:15,314 --> 00:53:17,404
You thief!

526
00:53:21,834 --> 00:53:24,754
- Xiao Shu?
- Kai Qi?

527
00:53:24,754 --> 00:53:26,514
- What are you doing here?
- I...

528
00:53:26,514 --> 00:53:28,654
- What are you doing with
the common fund box?

529
00:53:28,654 --> 00:53:30,814
I'm putting in money.

530
00:53:30,814 --> 00:53:33,164
Why are you putting in money?

531
00:53:34,224 --> 00:53:37,244
Because it's missing money.

532
00:53:37,244 --> 00:53:39,694
How did you know that
it was missing money?

533
00:53:45,154 --> 00:53:47,394
When did it happen?

534
00:53:48,314 --> 00:53:52,654
How long have you been
taking money and returning it?

535
00:53:54,274 --> 00:53:59,744
If my grandparents needed it,
I'd come here and borrow it.

536
00:54:02,734 --> 00:54:05,104
I'll pretend that I didn't
see anything today.

537
00:54:05,104 --> 00:54:09,134
You know that this is the wrong
way to show filial piety.

538
00:54:09,134 --> 00:54:10,674
Kai Qi.

539
00:54:10,674 --> 00:54:14,334
Clean this place up to the way
it was originally and leave.

540
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:19,794
Also, if you do this again,
you won't get away with it.

541
00:54:45,804 --> 00:54:47,993
What are you doing?
Aren't you afraid of the dark?

542
00:54:48,019 --> 00:54:49,324
What did you come in here for?

543
00:54:49,324 --> 00:54:52,044
What's wrong with you?
Aren't you afraid of danger?

544
00:54:52,044 --> 00:54:55,694
Do you think you're superhuman?
What if the thief hurt you?

545
00:54:55,694 --> 00:55:00,694
Seriously! You didn't even think about
the people who worry about you.

546
00:55:00,694 --> 00:55:04,194
Okay. I'm fine.

547
00:55:04,194 --> 00:55:07,484
I'm sorry for making you worried.

548
00:55:07,484 --> 00:55:10,574
There's no thief. Something just fell.

549
00:55:10,574 --> 00:55:13,744
Let's go. I'll take you outside.

550
00:55:30,394 --> 00:55:32,154
What's wrong with your hand?

551
00:55:32,154 --> 00:55:35,694
Nothing, I accidentally
bumped into it just now.

552
00:55:35,694 --> 00:55:37,274
Do you need to see a doctor?

553
00:55:37,274 --> 00:55:39,854
No, it's not that serious.

554
00:55:39,854 --> 00:55:42,194
But...

555
00:55:45,864 --> 00:55:47,954
Hello?

556
00:55:54,114 --> 00:55:57,114
Okay, I'll be there soon.

557
00:55:58,954 --> 00:56:01,694
Ah Jie, something came up. I'm leaving now.

558
00:56:01,694 --> 00:56:02,974
I'll take you there.

559
00:56:02,974 --> 00:56:05,714
It's okay. I rode my motorcycle here.

560
00:56:09,084 --> 00:56:11,634
Your keys.

561
00:56:21,434 --> 00:56:23,564
Any questions? If not, sign here.

562
00:56:23,564 --> 00:56:26,314
Let me take another look.

563
00:56:26,314 --> 00:56:28,064
What's wrong with you?

564
00:56:28,064 --> 00:56:30,064
It isn't enough that you ruined Kai Hui?

565
00:56:30,064 --> 00:56:32,514
You have to ruin Kai Qi too?

566
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:34,684
How can you kidnap someone?

567
00:56:34,684 --> 00:56:36,654
I was deceived that day!

568
00:56:36,654 --> 00:56:39,084
They told me I was transporting things.

569
00:56:39,084 --> 00:56:41,714
Didn't you say we had to move things?

570
00:56:41,714 --> 00:56:45,034
Move what? Wear this.

571
00:56:45,034 --> 00:56:48,544
- What's this?
- Don't ask so many questions.

572
00:56:50,944 --> 00:56:53,424
He's coming out.

573
00:56:53,424 --> 00:56:55,504
Who's coming out?

574
00:56:55,504 --> 00:56:57,754
Then why did you just
throw him by the road?

575
00:56:57,754 --> 00:56:59,424
What do you mean throw him by the road?

576
00:56:59,424 --> 00:57:02,074
Look at how injured he was!

577
00:57:02,074 --> 00:57:05,214
Ah Biao and Mosquito were chasing after me!

578
00:57:05,214 --> 00:57:08,444
If they caught up to me,
they'd beat him to death.

579
00:57:14,334 --> 00:57:15,834
Bro!

580
00:57:15,834 --> 00:57:18,124
If you're here, who's looking after him?

581
00:57:18,124 --> 00:57:20,194
It's fine, he's asleep.
He can't run away.

582
00:57:20,194 --> 00:57:21,954
My stomach suddenly really hurts.

583
00:57:21,954 --> 00:57:25,034
- Go over there!
- Okay

584
00:57:25,034 --> 00:57:29,404
Mosquito, we've been on
the run for a few days.

585
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:31,854
We can't keep going on like this.

586
00:57:31,854 --> 00:57:34,414
Do you have a better idea?

587
00:57:35,194 --> 00:57:39,504
I think we should let him go.

588
00:57:39,504 --> 00:57:42,364
What's wrong with your brain?

589
00:57:47,804 --> 00:57:52,684
What are you staring it?
Hurry and go after him!

590
00:57:52,684 --> 00:57:54,764
I'll drive.

591
00:58:16,864 --> 00:58:20,154
Brat! How dare you run away?

592
00:58:20,154 --> 00:58:22,864
I'm going to strangle you
and then collect the money!

593
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:34,284
Hey! What's going on?

594
00:58:54,284 --> 00:58:59,284
If I didn't leave him the phone so he'd
have the chance to call for help

595
00:58:59,284 --> 00:59:02,714
who would know to save him?

596
00:59:04,364 --> 00:59:06,304
I don't believe you.

597
00:59:06,304 --> 00:59:10,624
Miss, he really wasn't
the mastermind behind it.

598
00:59:10,624 --> 00:59:13,084
Not long after Fu Zi Xiang
was sent to the hospital

599
00:59:13,084 --> 00:59:15,344
Du Qing Shi came and turned himself in.

600
00:59:15,344 --> 00:59:17,824
Because he was willing to be the bait

601
00:59:17,824 --> 00:59:20,194
we were able to catch the two kidnappers.

602
00:59:20,194 --> 00:59:23,834
Did you hear that? I'm not that evil.

603
00:59:23,834 --> 00:59:26,464
Couldn't you have a conscience earlier?

604
00:59:26,464 --> 00:59:28,834
Do you know that you
dragged your daughter down?

605
00:59:28,834 --> 00:59:31,834
I didn't do it on purpose.

606
00:59:31,834 --> 00:59:37,664
I'm her father! How could I
deliberately try to ruin my daughter?

607
00:59:39,504 --> 00:59:42,014
Okay, let's go.

608
01:00:06,014 --> 01:00:07,634
Dad.

609
01:00:10,704 --> 01:00:13,374
Was what you just said true?

610
01:00:20,704 --> 01:00:22,674
Kai Qi.

611
01:00:24,714 --> 01:00:29,324
The only good thing I've done in my life

612
01:00:30,594 --> 01:00:33,724
is fathering you and your sister.

613
01:00:34,734 --> 01:00:37,134
Whether or not it's true

614
01:00:37,914 --> 01:00:40,314
just think about it on your own.

615
01:00:40,314 --> 01:00:42,574
I just hope that

616
01:00:44,844 --> 01:00:49,844
when I come out in the future

617
01:00:51,484 --> 01:00:54,844
I can eat

618
01:00:54,844 --> 01:00:57,904
a meal that you cooked for me.

619
01:02:04,464 --> 01:02:06,494
Kai Qi.

620
01:02:20,834 --> 01:02:22,844
Kai Qi.

621
01:02:24,464 --> 01:02:26,874
What's wrong?

622
01:02:31,084 --> 01:02:34,814
I really need a friend right now.

623
01:02:34,814 --> 01:02:37,504
Can I lean on you?

624
01:03:27,125 --> 01:03:29,575
Can I lean on you?

625
01:04:14,905 --> 01:04:17,015
Okay.

626
01:04:17,015 --> 01:04:20,775
I need someone to talk to right now.

627
01:04:20,775 --> 01:04:22,825
I'm right here.

628
01:04:22,825 --> 01:04:24,885
Are you hungry?

629
01:04:29,415 --> 01:04:32,935
So your dad actually saved Fu Zi Xiang?

630
01:04:35,675 --> 01:04:38,085
Well, we can't say saved

631
01:04:38,085 --> 01:04:42,455
since he is somewhat responsible
for things turning out this way.

632
01:04:43,785 --> 01:04:47,455
But the police said that
if it weren't for him

633
01:04:47,455 --> 01:04:50,475
they wouldn't have
found Zi Xiang so quickly.

634
01:04:52,715 --> 01:04:55,205
Knowing that he still has a conscience

635
01:04:55,205 --> 01:05:00,055
and didn't allow Zi Xiang
to get hurt even more.

636
01:05:01,845 --> 01:05:04,245
I really...

637
01:05:04,245 --> 01:05:07,485
I really heaved a sigh of relief.

638
01:05:18,695 --> 01:05:22,885
Shouldn't Fu Zi Jie be the first person
you share this good news with?

639
01:05:26,955 --> 01:05:28,925
I won't tell him.

640
01:05:32,005 --> 01:05:34,845
Even though you don't want to be with him

641
01:05:34,845 --> 01:05:39,225
letting him know that you're dad isn't
a bad person is a good thing.

642
01:05:39,225 --> 01:05:42,295
You see, Fu Zi Jie really
wants to be with you

643
01:05:42,295 --> 01:05:45,515
but at the same time, he feels
like he's betraying his brother.

644
01:05:45,515 --> 01:05:48,475
Don't you think this feeling
is very hard to bear?

645
01:05:52,125 --> 01:05:54,475
That's why I won't tell him.

646
01:05:55,015 --> 01:05:57,625
So what if I tell him?

647
01:05:59,975 --> 01:06:02,855
Even if Ah Jie likes me

648
01:06:02,855 --> 01:06:07,855
Mr. and Mrs. Fu can't not mind it.

649
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:14,215
Besides, Zi Xiang is still in the hospital.

650
01:06:15,435 --> 01:06:18,425
They're all good people.

651
01:06:18,425 --> 01:06:21,325
I don't want to hurt them.

652
01:06:26,045 --> 01:06:30,955
It wasn't easy to start interacting
with Ah Jie as regular friends.

653
01:06:30,955 --> 01:06:33,335
This is good.

654
01:06:34,775 --> 01:06:37,285
You must not tell him.

655
01:06:39,775 --> 01:06:45,405
Du Kai Qi, you little tormentor

656
01:06:46,885 --> 01:06:49,275
What are you saying?

657
01:06:50,405 --> 01:06:52,235
I'm saying what's in Fu Zi Jie's heart.

658
01:06:52,235 --> 01:06:58,235
The pitiful and suffering Fu Zi Jie,
whom you kept going back and forth.

659
01:06:58,235 --> 01:06:59,965
Hey, you!

660
01:06:59,965 --> 01:07:02,445
Okay, I got it.

661
01:07:02,445 --> 01:07:06,395
You're not telling him, so he wouldn't
a hard time on both sides.

662
01:07:10,205 --> 01:07:12,925
What do you plan on doing now?

663
01:07:14,795 --> 01:07:19,645
Focus on my work. I will make
your restaurant very popular.

664
01:07:22,615 --> 01:07:24,935
One for all.

665
01:07:27,245 --> 01:07:29,655
All for one.

666
01:07:32,375 --> 01:07:35,975
Oh right, why did you
come looking for me?

667
01:07:35,975 --> 01:07:40,085
I wanted to ask you how
Le Xuan's mid-term exam went.

668
01:07:40,085 --> 01:07:44,235
She seems to have decided
to do something extreme.

669
01:07:53,515 --> 01:07:56,025
She's really...

670
01:08:00,855 --> 01:08:02,905
Let her tell you herself

671
01:08:02,905 --> 01:08:05,195
if she wants to tell you.

672
01:08:34,295 --> 01:08:36,075
What's wrong with your hand?

673
01:08:36,075 --> 01:08:37,385
Nothing.

674
01:08:37,385 --> 01:08:39,895
Do you need to see a doctor?

675
01:09:12,585 --> 01:09:15,995
<i>Ah Jie, thank you.</i>

676
01:09:15,995 --> 01:09:18,525
<i>Even though we can't be together</i>

677
01:09:18,525 --> 01:09:25,495
<i>meeting you was the best thing
to have happened to me.</i>

678
01:09:52,875 --> 01:09:55,865
- What would you like to drink?
- Coffee.

679
01:09:57,095 --> 01:10:00,025
Why did you suddenly want to see me?

680
01:10:00,025 --> 01:10:03,805
Did you know that they've already
captured your brother's kidnappers?

681
01:10:03,805 --> 01:10:06,955
Yes, the police notified us.

682
01:10:07,915 --> 01:10:11,955
Then did you know that Kai Qi's
father actually saved your brother?

683
01:10:12,845 --> 01:10:15,705
- Thank you.
- What do you mean?

684
01:10:17,725 --> 01:10:20,475
Your brother was injured
because he tried to run away.

685
01:10:20,475 --> 01:10:24,825
In a moment of desperation,
Kai Qi's father saved your brother.

686
01:10:24,825 --> 01:10:27,285
But because your brother's
injuries were very serious

687
01:10:27,285 --> 01:10:29,725
Kai Qi's father didn't know what to do.

688
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:33,465
So he dropped him off in
front of a rural hospital.

689
01:10:33,465 --> 01:10:36,725
He purposefully left his cell phone
so that someone could find him.

690
01:10:36,725 --> 01:10:39,785
So it's not Kai Qi's father's fault
that my brother is like this.

691
01:10:39,785 --> 01:10:41,305
That's right.

692
01:10:41,305 --> 01:10:43,305
Then Kai Qi and I...

693
01:10:47,545 --> 01:10:50,215
Even though it has nothing
to do with Kai Qi's father

694
01:10:50,215 --> 01:10:52,985
she won't let herself off that lightly.

695
01:10:54,005 --> 01:10:56,365
Because ZI Xiang is still in the hospital

696
01:10:56,365 --> 01:10:59,675
Kai Qi must still think it's her fault.

697
01:10:59,675 --> 01:11:03,435
So we have to think of a way
to change the way Kai Qi thinks.

698
01:11:03,435 --> 01:11:06,005
You have a plan?

699
01:11:08,905 --> 01:11:12,985
But we can take a gamble.

700
01:11:12,985 --> 01:11:14,475
Gamble what?

701
01:11:14,475 --> 01:11:17,815
We'll take a gamble and see
if Du Kai Qi really likes you.

702
01:11:21,415 --> 01:11:24,105
Find a famous French restaurant
to compete with us.

703
01:11:24,105 --> 01:11:26,775
If you win, you'll get magazine coverage.

704
01:11:26,775 --> 01:11:30,905
If I win, you have to start over with me.

705
01:11:30,905 --> 01:11:35,015
Du Kai Qi, this time it's your
turn to chase after me.

706
01:11:35,015 --> 01:11:37,365
I don't know what Ah Jie likes to eat.

707
01:11:37,365 --> 01:11:39,195
Kai... Kai Qi.

708
01:11:39,195 --> 01:11:42,125
Do you want to...

709
01:11:44,195 --> 01:11:45,625
What?

710
01:11:45,625 --> 01:11:47,915
Play a game with me?

711
01:11:47,915 --> 01:11:52,915
