1
00:00:00,578 --> 00:00:02,667
Previously on Cardinal...

2
00:00:02,695 --> 00:00:03,844
They found a body.

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,422
It's not my department anymore.

4
00:00:05,445 --> 00:00:06,590
It's a child.

5
00:00:06,813 --> 00:00:08,278
They think it might be her.

6
00:00:08,587 --> 00:00:11,125
We're gonna throw everything
we have at this, Dorothy.

7
00:00:11,282 --> 00:00:12,889
You said that before.

8
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:14,436
Then you gave up.

9
00:00:14,452 --> 00:00:16,025
If I make you the lead on this,

10
00:00:16,056 --> 00:00:18,288
I need to know that
you're not gonna drift.

11
00:00:18,525 --> 00:00:19,849
Now her right eye,

12
00:00:20,133 --> 00:00:21,179
four abrasions,

13
00:00:21,179 --> 00:00:22,414
two upper, two lower.

14
00:00:22,414 --> 00:00:23,890
They could be from a speculum

15
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:25,108
to keep her eyes open.

16
00:00:25,671 --> 00:00:28,110
Katie Pine wasn't this
guy's first victim.

17
00:00:28,186 --> 00:00:29,210
He stalked her.

18
00:00:29,218 --> 00:00:31,026
And who does that?

19
00:00:31,179 --> 00:00:32,219
A repeater.

20
00:00:32,718 --> 00:00:34,435
I should come home.

21
00:00:35,023 --> 00:00:36,242
Catherine.

22
00:00:38,533 --> 00:00:40,466
Why so much this time?

23
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:45,332
I mean, there's a rumour

24
00:00:45,332 --> 00:00:46,925
our department's under investigation.

25
00:00:46,949 --> 00:00:48,430
It's gotta be a dirty cop

26
00:00:48,436 --> 00:00:49,725
or we'd handle it internally.

27
00:00:49,858 --> 00:00:51,545
You'll know the name Kyle Corbett,

28
00:00:51,584 --> 00:00:53,809
controls the bulk of the
drug trade north of Toronto.

29
00:00:53,817 --> 00:00:56,778
Someone from our side is
feeding Corbett information.

30
00:00:56,817 --> 00:00:58,410
Find the link

31
00:00:58,504 --> 00:01:00,458
between Cardinal and Corbett.

32

Listen, we don't know
Cardinal's done anything wrong.

39
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,760
That's right.

40
00:02:17,236 --> 00:02:18,595
If he's dirty,

41
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:20,163
I'm not getting in your way

42
00:02:20,198 --> 00:02:21,759
but right now,

43
00:02:21,807 --> 00:02:23,181
this nightmare...

44
00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:26,911
whatever else Musgrave has you doing,

45
00:02:26,945 --> 00:02:27,945
this is your priority.

46
00:02:28,881 --> 00:02:29,881
Clear?

47
00:02:37,322 --> 00:02:39,780
I need to go to Toronto for the autopsy.

48
00:02:40,292 --> 00:02:41,292
I'll come with you.

49
00:02:41,727 --> 00:02:42,727
It's not necessary.

50
00:02:44,162 --> 00:02:45,162
You've been up all night.

51
00:02:46,064 --> 00:02:47,064
You could use a co-pilot.

52
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,104
We leave in half an hour.

53
00:02:53,572 --> 00:02:54,538
Okay.

54
00:02:54,573 --> 00:02:55,573
What do I tell your mom?

55
00:02:55,607 --> 00:02:56,607
She keeps calling.

56
00:02:57,142 --> 00:02:58,109
I can't go.

57
00:02:58,143 --> 00:02:59,377
I won't be back in time.

58
00:02:59,411 --> 00:03:01,245
All right. Just the
whole clan will be there.

59
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,246
She made that clear.

60
00:03:02,281 --> 00:03:03,119
All the cousins.

61
00:03:03,144 --> 00:03:04,248
I know.

62
00:03:04,283 --> 00:03:06,117
Sugar shack, sing-alongs, mulled wine.

63
00:03:08,954 --> 00:03:10,154
We don't drink mulled wine.

64
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:13,691
So what do I tell her?

65
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,660
Tell her

66
00:03:15,994 --> 00:03:17,929
someone's murdering children.

67
00:03:17,954 --> 00:03:19,992
It's my job to stop them.

68
00:03:20,026 --> 00:03:21,432
Busy at work.

69
00:03:21,466 --> 00:03:22,466
I'll let her know.

70
00:03:25,437 --> 00:03:27,438
Since when do you want to see my family?

71
00:03:27,472 --> 00:03:28,906
I don't know. It's been a while.

72
00:03:28,941 --> 00:03:30,408
It might do you some good.

73
00:03:30,442 --> 00:03:32,276
- Me?
- And me. Us.

74
00:03:34,279 --> 00:03:35,479
Speaking of which,
shouldn't we know something?

75
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:39,150
Oh. Sorry.

76
00:03:40,052 --> 00:03:42,153
I-I should have told you.

77
00:03:42,187 --> 00:03:43,187
Um, no.

78
00:03:44,356 --> 00:03:45,790
No. I found out a couple days ago.

79
00:03:47,693 --> 00:03:48,693
So we keep trying.

80
00:03:51,196 --> 00:03:54,098
As tortuous as that process is for me.

81
00:03:57,836 --> 00:04:00,037
It's not mulled wine.

82
00:04:00,072 --> 00:04:01,072
It's got whiskey in it.

83
00:04:02,564 --> 00:04:03,641
It's called caribou.

84
00:04:06,645 --> 00:04:08,446
- Bye.
- Bye.

85
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,355
So your daughter lives
in Toronto, right?

86
00:04:21,593 --> 00:04:22,560
That's gotta be hard,

87
00:04:22,594 --> 00:04:23,828
being so far apart.

88
00:04:23,862 --> 00:04:24,829
She grew up there.

89
00:04:24,863 --> 00:04:25,863
She wanted to stay.

90
00:04:27,532 --> 00:04:28,532
You didn't?

91
00:04:29,868 --> 00:04:31,249
Algonquin Bay's my home.

92
00:04:33,171 --> 00:04:34,839
Yeah but I mean you spent, what,

93
00:04:34,873 --> 00:04:37,074
ten years over there.

94
00:04:37,109 --> 00:04:38,909
Decorated big city detective.

95
00:04:38,944 --> 00:04:40,044
That's a lot to leave behind.

96
00:04:40,078 --> 00:04:41,078
It was easy.

97
00:04:46,585 --> 00:04:47,585
What does your wife do?

98
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,891
Hey. If you don't
want to talk, suits me.

99
00:04:56,228 --> 00:04:58,229
Or I could tell you what
day Katie Pine was killed.

100
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:04,935
I was thinking about it last night.

101
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:07,538
The coroner said the petechial
hemorrhaging was preserved

102
00:05:07,572 --> 00:05:09,240
because the tissue was frozen

103
00:05:09,274 --> 00:05:11,609
but we know from the melt water that

104
00:05:11,643 --> 00:05:14,211
it was above zero when Katie was dumped.

105
00:05:14,246 --> 00:05:17,248
So it must have snapped
cold soon after within

106
00:05:17,282 --> 00:05:20,618
three days or the tissue
would have degraded.

107
00:05:20,652 --> 00:05:23,421
I checked the weather
records starting October 29th,

108
00:05:23,455 --> 00:05:25,689
the date she went missing.

109
00:05:25,724 --> 00:05:29,034
It dropped below freezing
on the eleventh of November.

110
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,760
So sometime between the
eighth and the eleventh

111
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,544
Katie was killed and dumped.

112
00:05:40,405 --> 00:05:42,433
He had her a week before he killed her.

113
00:05:44,976 --> 00:05:45,976
Uh huh.

114
00:05:54,152 --> 00:05:55,352
Are both your parents French?

115
00:05:56,588 --> 00:05:57,588
Interesting.

116
00:05:57,989 --> 00:05:58,989
Hmm?

117
00:06:00,292 --> 00:06:01,592
Rule of thumb.

118
00:06:01,626 --> 00:06:04,662
If I ask a guy five questions
before he asks one back,

119
00:06:05,597 --> 00:06:06,564
well then he's a douche

120
00:06:06,598 --> 00:06:08,926
and you just squeaked in under the wire.

121
00:06:14,506 --> 00:06:16,136
What is your rule about answering?

122
00:06:18,343 --> 00:06:19,343
Both French.

123
00:06:22,047 --> 00:06:23,514
You want a coffee?

124
00:06:23,548 --> 00:06:24,548
Yeah, black.

125
00:06:25,617 --> 00:06:26,617
There.

126
00:06:26,985 --> 00:06:28,185
That's two questions that I asked.

127
00:07:08,369 --> 00:07:10,194
I forgot money.

128
00:07:10,228 --> 00:07:11,228
Hmm?

129
00:07:12,397 --> 00:07:13,364
Yeah, right.

130
00:07:35,187 --> 00:07:36,253
Lise Delorme,

131
00:07:36,288 --> 00:07:37,755
Dr. Len Torres.

132
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:38,789
Nice to meet you.

133
00:07:39,791 --> 00:07:40,791
What happened there?

134
00:07:42,294 --> 00:07:43,661
I was fixing a frozen pipe

135
00:07:43,695 --> 00:07:45,327
and I smacked my head.

136
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,401
This way. They're just pulling up.

137
00:07:53,271 --> 00:07:55,439
You know that's not an
issue anymore, right?

138
00:07:55,473 --> 00:07:56,740
Frozen pipes?

139
00:07:56,775 --> 00:07:59,076
Something the modern world has solved.

140
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,244
I had a raccoon

141
00:08:00,278 --> 00:08:02,793
in my crawl space and it
tore out the insulation.

142
00:08:04,496 --> 00:08:06,584
Now you're just making my point for me.

143
00:08:31,643 --> 00:08:33,043
We leave them wrapped

144
00:08:33,078 --> 00:08:35,646
so we catch anything that
might still be in the material,

145
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,647
bullet fragments,

146
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:38,048
weapons.

147
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,316
This is Dr. Torres.

148
00:08:39,351 --> 00:08:42,586
Preliminary scan of subject 20089.

149
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:44,755
Multiple fractures to the seventh,

150
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:47,725
fifth and fourth ribs.

151
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:50,894
Fractures of the ulna
and the wrist bone.

152
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:52,563
They look like defensive wounds.

153
00:08:52,597 --> 00:08:53,597
Did you get this?

154
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,389
Open fracture to the left collarbone.

155
00:08:59,771 --> 00:09:00,771
Hmm.

156
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,174
Foreign objects

157
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:05,309
entering the parietal bone,

158
00:09:05,343 --> 00:09:08,512
penetrating clear down
and out the temporal.

159
00:09:10,427 --> 00:09:12,419
Blunt force trauma to the skull.

160
00:09:12,784 --> 00:09:14,018
Multiple blows.

161
00:09:16,971 --> 00:09:18,122
What is this?

162
00:09:22,494 --> 00:09:23,894
Your guess is as good as mine.

163
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,699
You okay?

164
00:09:29,134 --> 00:09:30,134
Yeah.

165
00:09:31,736 --> 00:09:33,837
It gets worse from here.

166
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,640
I'll be fine.

167
00:09:52,815 --> 00:09:56,393
Lacerations on the thigh and
upper leg on the right side.

168
00:09:56,428 --> 00:09:59,730
Could be the work of
pliers or wire cutters.

169
00:09:59,764 --> 00:10:01,532
Some of this was frenzy violence but

170
00:10:01,566 --> 00:10:03,528
some if it was purposeful.

171
00:10:03,568 --> 00:10:04,568
He was experimenting.

172
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:16,780
A spike in his head,

173
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:18,549
pounded in, broken off.

174
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,420
Excuse me.

175
00:10:40,438 --> 00:10:41,438
Audio tape.

176
00:10:58,473 --> 00:11:00,141
My first time here

177
00:11:00,175 --> 00:11:02,176
was a subway jumper,

178
00:11:02,211 --> 00:11:03,211
woman in her fifties.

179
00:11:05,013 --> 00:11:06,013
She got

180
00:11:06,481 --> 00:11:09,617
corkscrewed up under the wheels.

181
00:11:09,651 --> 00:11:10,618
Legs backward,

182
00:11:10,652 --> 00:11:14,622
her whole side sheared off.

183
00:11:14,656 --> 00:11:16,490
Are you trying to settle my stomach?

184
00:11:18,695 --> 00:11:21,963
I gutted my way through
the autopsy like a champion

185
00:11:21,997 --> 00:11:22,997
until

186
00:11:25,334 --> 00:11:26,734
we found a piece of litter,

187
00:11:28,837 --> 00:11:32,039
one of those orange juice caps that

188
00:11:32,074 --> 00:11:33,908
pops when you, when you open it.

189
00:11:36,178 --> 00:11:37,979
It had been

190
00:11:38,013 --> 00:11:41,054
driven through her cheek

191
00:11:41,984 --> 00:11:45,486
so it was half in, half...

192
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,520
half out of her mouth.

193
00:11:49,797 --> 00:11:51,659
And that's, uh, that's when I lost it.

194
00:11:54,229 --> 00:11:56,063
Then you got sick?

195
00:11:56,098 --> 00:11:57,531
Oh, I passed out,

196
00:11:57,566 --> 00:11:59,066
hit the floor.

197
00:11:59,101 --> 00:12:00,101
You didn't.

198
00:12:00,736 --> 00:12:01,869
Ask Len.

199
00:12:01,904 --> 00:12:03,371
Woke up with him

200
00:12:03,405 --> 00:12:04,405
flicking water in my face.

201
00:12:10,178 --> 00:12:13,347
Listen. We can't do
the internal work, uh,

202
00:12:13,382 --> 00:12:16,584
until the body's thawed so you
should go back to the hotel and

203
00:12:16,618 --> 00:12:18,052
get some sleep.

204
00:12:18,086 --> 00:12:19,086
And what about you?

205
00:12:20,088 --> 00:12:21,088
Oh. I uh,

206
00:12:22,224 --> 00:12:23,903
daughter hotline.

207
00:12:24,793 --> 00:12:27,795
She's-she's found some
time in her busy schedule.

208
00:12:39,035 --> 00:12:41,208
Are you here to see me or a dead body?

209
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:42,710
Why not both?

210
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,913
- Hi.
- Mm.

211
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,583
Let's have a look.

212
00:12:49,618 --> 00:12:50,685
Can we not here? Really?

213
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:51,919
Let me see. Let me see.

214
00:12:58,427 --> 00:12:59,427
Happy?

215
00:13:00,295 --> 00:13:01,295
I'm fine. Seriously.

216
00:13:03,598 --> 00:13:04,598
You hungry?

217
00:13:04,633 --> 00:13:05,633
Uh, yeah.

218
00:13:06,802 --> 00:13:08,636
When do you think she'll get out?

219
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,804
Soon.

220
00:13:09,838 --> 00:13:10,805
You don't,

221
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:12,940
you don't need to worry about that.

222
00:13:12,975 --> 00:13:14,642
You know, she was feeling, uh,

223
00:13:14,676 --> 00:13:16,744
a little out of balance
but she caught it in time.

224
00:13:16,778 --> 00:13:18,779
We're just-we're just being careful.

225
00:13:20,415 --> 00:13:22,383
She called me, you know.

226
00:13:22,417 --> 00:13:25,052
A couple weeks ago before she went in.

227
00:13:25,087 --> 00:13:26,821
She called the school
in the middle of the day

228
00:13:26,855 --> 00:13:28,923
and they pulled me out of class.

229
00:13:28,957 --> 00:13:31,459
Thought it was an emergency but

230
00:13:31,493 --> 00:13:34,962
she just wanted to talk
about plans for the spring,

231
00:13:34,997 --> 00:13:37,631
a hike she wanted to take and

232
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:39,632
some mural she wants to paint?

233
00:13:40,469 --> 00:13:41,669
She was all over the place.

234
00:13:44,506 --> 00:13:46,340
I should have known
that she was in trouble.

235
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:49,477
That's not her.

236
00:13:49,511 --> 00:13:50,511
Yeah, I know.

237
00:13:51,847 --> 00:13:53,280
She won't even remember making the call.

238
00:13:56,618 --> 00:13:57,985
I don't know how you stay so patient.

239
00:14:02,524 --> 00:14:04,458
They got something off the audio tape.

240
00:14:04,493 --> 00:14:05,493
I'll pick you up.

241
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:12,466
Is that your new partner?

242
00:14:13,668 --> 00:14:14,668
Yeah.

243
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,670
Dad, she's hot.

244
00:14:17,906 --> 00:14:19,840
That's... she's-she's-

245
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:20,875
Hi.

246
00:14:23,311 --> 00:14:26,313
Uh Kelly, this is Delorme.

247
00:14:26,848 --> 00:14:29,016
- Lise.
- Lise. Nice to meet you.

248
00:14:29,051 --> 00:14:30,051
My pleasure.

249
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,453
- Okay.
- Yeah.

250
00:14:32,487 --> 00:14:33,487
Bye.

251
00:14:35,802 --> 00:14:37,358
Hey, you should start running again.

252
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,560
Why?

253
00:14:40,595 --> 00:14:41,595
'Cause you like it.

254
00:14:43,999 --> 00:14:44,999
Okay bye.

255
00:14:48,236 --> 00:14:49,437
There's a male's voice on the tape.

256
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:52,039
They think it's the killer.

257
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:54,742
Why do they think that?

258
00:14:56,545 --> 00:14:58,179
There's a young girl's voice too.

259
00:15:10,192 --> 00:15:11,192
He's taking pictures.

260
00:15:12,394 --> 00:15:13,994
An SLR. Film.

261
00:15:14,029 --> 00:15:15,029
Not digital.

262
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,700
Please.

263
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,410
What is that? What's that noise?

264
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:32,580
Just let me go.

265
00:15:33,915 --> 00:15:35,116
Look at me, Katie.

266
00:15:36,218 --> 00:15:37,418
Look right here.

267
00:15:37,986 --> 00:15:39,420
Please don't...

268
00:15:39,454 --> 00:15:40,654
trying to be nice.

269
00:15:47,896 --> 00:15:48,896
That's all we got.

270
00:15:53,235 --> 00:15:54,235
It gives us his voice.

271
00:15:55,937 --> 00:15:56,937
It connects the killings.

272
00:15:59,341 --> 00:16:00,341
Why would he do that?

273
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:05,179
Maybe a mistake.

274
00:16:05,347 --> 00:16:06,580
He didn't think we'd recover it.

275
00:16:07,115 --> 00:16:08,115
Uh...

276
00:16:10,785 --> 00:16:11,785
or he's escalating.

277
00:16:12,821 --> 00:16:13,821
He wants to flaunt it.

278
00:16:22,664 --> 00:16:24,498
My wife has bipolar disorder.

279
00:16:26,768 --> 00:16:27,868
That's why we moved back.

280
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,670
I thought the slower pace
would be good for her.

281
00:16:32,107 --> 00:16:33,357
You were asking before.

282
00:16:35,255 --> 00:16:36,777
I'm sorry. I had no idea that-

283
00:17:47,082 --> 00:17:48,649
When Todd Curry went missing,

284
00:17:48,683 --> 00:17:50,985
he said he was going to visit his uncle

285
00:17:51,019 --> 00:17:52,753
but the uncle down in Hamilton said

286
00:17:52,787 --> 00:17:54,154
there was no such arrangement,

287
00:17:54,189 --> 00:17:55,921
hadn't talked to Curry in months.

288
00:17:57,726 --> 00:17:58,810
Why the lie?

289
00:17:58,841 --> 00:18:01,061
The officer in charge
was Detective Peters.

290
00:18:01,096 --> 00:18:03,097
If he knows then he didn't
put it in his report.

291
00:18:07,902 --> 00:18:08,902
We'll have to ask him.

292
00:18:10,205 --> 00:18:11,672
He was classic runaway material.

293
00:18:11,706 --> 00:18:13,741
I mean, drugs,

294
00:18:13,775 --> 00:18:14,742
troubles in school,

295
00:18:14,776 --> 00:18:16,043
no mom in the house.

296
00:18:16,077 --> 00:18:17,278
Yeah but if you're running away,

297
00:18:17,312 --> 00:18:18,693
why make up a story?

298
00:18:20,842 --> 00:18:22,053
How do you mean?

299
00:18:23,118 --> 00:18:25,886
The cover story about
going to his uncle's.

300
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,122
If the plan is not to come back,

301
00:18:28,156 --> 00:18:29,256
you don't need a cover story.

302
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:30,291
You just go.

303
00:18:30,825 --> 00:18:32,416
Tell me your name again.

304
00:18:34,296 --> 00:18:35,296
Lise Delorme.

305
00:18:36,164 --> 00:18:37,865
Well Lise,

306
00:18:37,899 --> 00:18:40,301
maybe he wanted to buy some
time to get out of town.

307
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,404
Yeah.

308
00:18:43,438 --> 00:18:45,739
Or maybe he wasn't planning
on being gone for long

309
00:18:45,774 --> 00:18:47,708
but he was doing something
he wasn't supposed to

310
00:18:47,742 --> 00:18:48,742
so he lied.

311
00:18:50,578 --> 00:18:51,578
What were his interests?

312
00:18:51,946 --> 00:18:52,913
Concert in Toronto?

313
00:18:52,947 --> 00:18:53,947
Out of town girlfriend?

314
00:18:56,151 --> 00:18:58,527
Lucky for everyone involved
you're on the case now.

315
00:19:06,995 --> 00:19:09,997
Detective Peters didn't
have any details about

316
00:19:10,031 --> 00:19:11,031
how Todd was killed.

317
00:19:12,967 --> 00:19:14,904
Well we're just learning that.

318
00:19:16,671 --> 00:19:17,971
Yep, but I mean,

319
00:19:18,006 --> 00:19:19,440
you must have some indication.

320
00:19:19,474 --> 00:19:21,108
You're-you're the one
who found him, right?

321
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,510
Yes.

322
00:19:25,046 --> 00:19:27,527
Detective, don't make
me fill in the blanks.

323
00:19:32,187 --> 00:19:34,295
Early indications are that your son

324
00:19:37,459 --> 00:19:39,432
was harmed before he died.

325
00:19:41,229 --> 00:19:42,721
What does that mean? Harmed?

326
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:46,834
There are signs that...

327
00:19:51,206 --> 00:19:52,206
Mr. Curry,

328
00:19:53,742 --> 00:19:54,808
it's easy to believe

329
00:19:54,843 --> 00:19:58,645
that these details will
help you to move forward but

330
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,847
that's not always the case.

331
00:19:59,881 --> 00:20:01,227
That's not for you to decide.

332
00:20:03,752 --> 00:20:06,620
I'm just suggesting
that until we know more,

333
00:20:06,654 --> 00:20:08,522
- you take the time...
- Listen to me.

334
00:20:08,556 --> 00:20:09,757
You tell me what you know.

335
00:20:10,992 --> 00:20:11,992
You tell me right now.

336
00:20:13,395 --> 00:20:14,395
He was tortured

337
00:20:16,852 --> 00:20:17,898
and beaten

338
00:20:18,933 --> 00:20:19,933
and degraded.

339
00:20:25,707 --> 00:20:27,674
We don't know the precise cause of death

340
00:20:27,709 --> 00:20:30,598
because your son
received so many injuries.

341
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,024
If you're taking off for good,

342
00:20:46,227 --> 00:20:47,227
you bring your laptop.

343
00:20:49,898 --> 00:20:52,833
I'm telling you this
kid didn't run away;

344
00:20:52,867 --> 00:20:53,867
he went to do something.

345
00:20:54,903 --> 00:20:55,903
Or meet someone.

346
00:20:57,739 --> 00:20:58,739
Pack it up. Yeah.

347
00:21:03,578 --> 00:21:04,578
Thanks.

348
00:21:05,647 --> 00:21:07,080
I used to be good at that,

349
00:21:08,716 --> 00:21:10,390
talking to people about their dead.

350
00:21:43,651 --> 00:21:46,386
The killer got Katie
Pine out to Windigo Island

351
00:21:46,421 --> 00:21:47,788
before the lake froze.

352
00:21:47,822 --> 00:21:49,122
So Hannam,

353
00:21:49,157 --> 00:21:50,891
check the marinas, all right?

354
00:21:50,925 --> 00:21:51,892
Maybe he owns a boat.

355
00:21:51,926 --> 00:21:52,894
More likely

356
00:21:52,951 --> 00:21:54,328
he wouldn't use his own so,

357
00:21:54,362 --> 00:21:56,763
something stolen, rentals.

358
00:21:56,798 --> 00:21:58,298
Ask around see what pops up.

359
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,333
McLeod,

360
00:22:00,301 --> 00:22:03,337
pathology reports on Pine and Curry.

361
00:22:03,371 --> 00:22:06,106
I want you to handle ViCLAS personally.

362
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:07,474
Compare it to past cases,

363
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:09,142
anything with a torture element.

364
00:22:09,177 --> 00:22:10,611
Start provincial then widen out,

365
00:22:10,645 --> 00:22:11,986
going back twenty years.

366
00:22:12,714 --> 00:22:13,714
Twenty?

367
00:22:13,815 --> 00:22:14,848
Twenty.

368
00:22:14,883 --> 00:22:17,484
This guy's tech is
old so maybe he is too.

369
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:19,420
Could be this isn't his first foray.

370
00:22:21,222 --> 00:22:22,189
Last piece.

371
00:22:22,223 --> 00:22:24,124
Uh, the audio guys pulled more detail

372
00:22:24,158 --> 00:22:25,792
out of the Katie Pine tape.

373
00:22:25,827 --> 00:22:27,261
They've isolated the chirping

374
00:22:27,295 --> 00:22:29,763
of a seeing impaired traffic signal.

375
00:22:29,797 --> 00:22:31,632
Delorme and I are on that.

376
00:22:31,666 --> 00:22:32,666
Now listen,

377
00:22:33,401 --> 00:22:34,668
two victims,

378
00:22:34,702 --> 00:22:36,169
one from out of town,

379
00:22:36,204 --> 00:22:37,437
one local,

380
00:22:37,472 --> 00:22:38,805
no indication they knew each other,

381
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,674
but somehow they were chosen.

382
00:22:41,843 --> 00:22:42,809
Right?

383
00:22:42,844 --> 00:22:44,678
So no clue too small.

384
00:22:44,712 --> 00:22:45,946
Anywhere these kids might have gone,

385
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,681
anyone they might have talked to,

386
00:22:47,715 --> 00:22:48,682
let's write it down,

387
00:22:48,716 --> 00:22:49,783
stick it on the board

388
00:22:49,817 --> 00:22:51,952
so we can find some crossover.

389
00:22:51,986 --> 00:22:52,953
Late night, Fox?

390
00:22:52,987 --> 00:22:53,807
Hmm?

391
00:22:53,885 --> 00:22:57,291
Uh, sorry sir. Kid's got croup.

392
00:22:57,325 --> 00:22:58,926
Yeah. Well keep it in here.

393
00:23:00,562 --> 00:23:02,195
And that goes for the rest of us.

394
00:23:03,097 --> 00:23:04,865
All right? Out there,

395
00:23:04,899 --> 00:23:06,166
no yawning, no laughing,

396
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,989
no checking Facebook on your break.

397
00:23:09,904 --> 00:23:11,204
These people are grieving

398
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:12,539
and they're scared

399
00:23:12,574 --> 00:23:13,980
and they're looking to us.

400
00:23:16,544 --> 00:23:18,211
So let's be the cops they need to see.

401
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:28,106
I need you to go downtown

402
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,875
and get a map of all the
seeing impaired traffic signals.

403
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,477
- Yeah.
- Uh...

404
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:33,511
Lise?

405
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,379
- Hey.
- Hey.

406
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,414
What are you doing here?

407
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:40,852
Uh, I had a meeting in the area.

408
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:42,720
Thought I'd take a chance,
see if you were free?

409
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,556
I'm on my way out.

410
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:49,068
Um, Josh, John Cardinal.

411
00:23:49,103 --> 00:23:51,065
Ah. The new partner.

412
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,940
I gotta say I had a
different picture in my mind.

413
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,008
Oh yeah?

414
00:23:55,042 --> 00:23:56,542
Lise said that you seemed
older than your years,

415
00:23:56,577 --> 00:23:59,045
but I don't know, you
don't look that old.

416
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:00,079
Cheers.

417
00:24:01,882 --> 00:24:03,716
I'll walk you out.
I'll just grab my coat.

418
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,423
Yeah. I used to come

419
00:24:10,457 --> 00:24:11,858
visit her at work all the time

420
00:24:11,892 --> 00:24:13,359
when we first started dating.

421
00:24:13,394 --> 00:24:14,761
Yeah. I'd bring her
lunches, like hot lunches

422
00:24:14,795 --> 00:24:15,862
in those tiffin carriers.

423
00:24:15,896 --> 00:24:16,863
- You know those things?
- No.

424
00:24:16,897 --> 00:24:17,964
Like the-like those stacking,

425
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,432
like metal tins from India? No?

426
00:24:21,268 --> 00:24:23,036
Well, uh, I-I was learning how to cook

427
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,070
and she's my best client.

428
00:24:24,638 --> 00:24:25,638
You're a,

429
00:24:26,273 --> 00:24:27,407
a chef?

430
00:24:27,441 --> 00:24:28,408
No, no, no, no.

431
00:24:28,442 --> 00:24:29,442
Hydrologist.

432
00:24:31,111 --> 00:24:33,046
So how'd you end up partners anyway?

433
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,714
Did you decide that?

434
00:24:34,748 --> 00:24:36,481
No. That, uh,

435
00:24:36,617 --> 00:24:37,832
that comes from above.

436
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:41,854
Ah, nice meeting you, John.

437
00:24:42,823 --> 00:24:43,823
And you.

438
00:24:53,133 --> 00:24:54,734
I noticed him when I was cooking dinner.

439
00:24:54,768 --> 00:24:55,768
Didn't think much of it

440
00:24:55,803 --> 00:24:57,503
but then I looked half an hour later,

441
00:24:57,538 --> 00:24:59,105
he was still standing here.

442
00:24:59,139 --> 00:25:00,139
Where exactly?

443
00:25:00,507 --> 00:25:01,507
Right there.

444
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:02,542
Right about there.

445
00:25:03,811 --> 00:25:04,777
That's when I realized

446
00:25:04,812 --> 00:25:06,946
he was staring into Dorothy's window.

447
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,448
I didn't want to worry her with it

448
00:25:08,482 --> 00:25:10,316
but I thought with
everything I should call you.

449
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,754
Did you get a look at his face?

450
00:25:14,788 --> 00:25:15,755
When I came out,

451
00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:17,323
he got on his machine and took off.

452
00:25:17,357 --> 00:25:18,640
He was pulling a sled.

453
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,360
Should we tell Dorothy?

454
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:30,002
I'll take care of it.

455
00:25:30,037 --> 00:25:31,037
Okay. Thank you.

456
00:25:37,678 --> 00:25:39,378
Hey. We're going to grab a bite to eat.

457
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:40,446
You in?

458
00:25:40,481 --> 00:25:41,681
I can't go until he does.

459
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:43,983
Well, that could take a while.

460
00:25:44,017 --> 00:25:46,428
Home life can't be real
enticing for him these days.

461
00:25:48,388 --> 00:25:49,956
And you know about that?

462
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,357
Yeah. I was there.

463
00:25:51,391 --> 00:25:53,559
Call came in, ADP down at Memorial,

464
00:25:53,594 --> 00:25:54,794
a couple weeks ago.

465
00:25:54,828 --> 00:25:56,863
I pull up expecting to see
some old lady in a robe,

466
00:25:56,897 --> 00:25:58,498
instead it's Catherine Cardinal.

467
00:25:58,532 --> 00:25:59,499
Nice clothes,

468
00:25:59,533 --> 00:26:00,533
hair brushed but not well.

469
00:26:02,389 --> 00:26:03,703
What kind of not well?

470
00:26:05,005 --> 00:26:06,038
Delusional,

471
00:26:06,073 --> 00:26:07,039
agitated,

472
00:26:07,074 --> 00:26:09,842
not making any sense and,

473
00:26:09,877 --> 00:26:10,877
not happy to see me.

474
00:26:12,045 --> 00:26:13,379
Did you bring her in?

475
00:26:13,413 --> 00:26:14,380
No, are you kidding?

476
00:26:14,414 --> 00:26:15,548
No. I called Cardinal

477
00:26:15,582 --> 00:26:17,917
and I tried to keep her off
the ice till he got there.

478
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:20,953
He had to put her in a bear
hug to get her in the car.

479
00:26:22,389 --> 00:26:23,389
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

480
00:26:25,058 --> 00:26:27,513
He asked me to keep
this off the books so...

481
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:31,931
I got a bottle of scotch
out of the deal anyway.

482
00:27:14,608 --> 00:27:15,608
What's this?

483
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:19,278
Uh, your mom dropped that by.

484
00:27:19,646 --> 00:27:21,647
Yeah, why did my mom
bring us a teddy bear?

485
00:27:26,152 --> 00:27:27,720
I might have let it slip

486
00:27:27,754 --> 00:27:28,754
we're trying.

487
00:27:29,089 --> 00:27:30,489
She was coming at me, Lise.

488
00:27:30,524 --> 00:27:32,258
She was guilting me out
about never visiting.

489
00:27:32,292 --> 00:27:33,459
You know how she is, I panicked.

490
00:27:33,493 --> 00:27:34,927
I just wanted the encounter to end.

491
00:27:36,463 --> 00:27:37,930
Everyone's gonna know now.

492
00:27:37,965 --> 00:27:39,732
Yeah, well is that the
worst thing in the world?

493
00:27:39,766 --> 00:27:41,400
What if it doesn't work?

494
00:27:41,435 --> 00:27:44,303
Now we have to have that
conversation twenty-five times.

495
00:27:44,338 --> 00:27:45,338
It'll work.

496
00:27:46,173 --> 00:27:47,473
This isn't your thing, Josh.

497
00:27:47,507 --> 00:27:49,342
You don't make the
decisions on your own.

498
00:27:51,612 --> 00:27:52,612
Seriously? You're leaving?

499
00:27:52,946 --> 00:27:53,946
Yeah. I need some air.

500
00:27:54,781 --> 00:27:55,781
Dee, come on.

501
00:28:10,998 --> 00:28:12,198
Where you off to, Ronnie?

502
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,400
Hey.

503
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:18,632
I just keep seeing her face

504
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,136
staring up out of that ice.

505
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,079
I dream about her too.

506
00:28:28,982 --> 00:28:31,017
Except then she's moving and

507
00:28:31,051 --> 00:28:32,251
trying to claw her way out.

508
00:28:35,155 --> 00:28:36,155
Like she's angry.

509
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:41,661
How's her mom do it, Jerry?

510
00:28:41,695 --> 00:28:43,789
How does she survive a thing like that?

511
00:28:46,533 --> 00:28:48,289
Well, she's already
been through hell, Ron.

512
00:28:50,704 --> 00:28:52,421
You need to respect her space.

513
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,010
I just,

514
00:28:58,045 --> 00:28:59,045
I don't know.

515
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:04,100
I want to keep an eye on her, you know?

516
00:29:06,053 --> 00:29:07,453
I want to see her live through it.

517
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,708
You've already met Katie's spirit.

518
00:29:14,061 --> 00:29:16,097
You need to honour her other half.

519
00:29:18,765 --> 00:29:19,765
The girl she was.

520
00:29:28,018 --> 00:29:29,608
This is soil

521
00:29:29,643 --> 00:29:30,964
from the fairgrounds,

522
00:29:33,246 --> 00:29:35,162
the last place where she was seen alive.

523
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:37,650
I want you to keep it.

524
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,219
Go.

525
00:30:59,244 --> 00:31:00,533
Yeah, sorry Sergeant.

526
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,334
I wouldn't have called
if it wasn't important.

527
00:31:02,369 --> 00:31:03,369
Just talk, Delorme.

528
00:31:04,638 --> 00:31:05,604
Well our favourite detective

529
00:31:05,639 --> 00:31:07,640
is running some kind of two a.m. errand

530
00:31:08,675 --> 00:31:09,675
and I'm tailing him.

531
00:31:10,343 --> 00:31:11,477
Why?

532
00:31:11,511 --> 00:31:13,512
I couldn't sleep. I was out driving.

533
00:31:13,547 --> 00:31:14,814
I just saw him go by.

534
00:31:14,848 --> 00:31:15,881
Okay, where are you?

535
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:18,784
Uh, travelling north on Highway 12.

536
00:31:18,819 --> 00:31:19,819
We just passed Tilden Lake.

537
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:22,455
He's alone.

538
00:31:22,489 --> 00:31:23,489
What should I do?

539
00:31:25,092 --> 00:31:26,092
Back off.

540
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,394
Stop the car and turn around.

541
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,395
It's too risky.

542
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,663
What?

543
00:31:30,697 --> 00:31:31,864
A single person tailing
a trained detective.

544
00:31:31,898 --> 00:31:32,865
He'll spot you.

545
00:31:32,899 --> 00:31:34,533
You're gonna tank the investigation.

546
00:31:36,069 --> 00:31:37,470
Sergeant.

547
00:31:37,504 --> 00:31:38,704
Stop the car and turn around, Delorme.

548
00:31:38,738 --> 00:31:39,839
Those are your orders.

549
00:31:39,873 --> 00:31:40,873
Yes, sir.

550
00:33:36,289 --> 00:33:37,289
Hi.

551
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,358
The guy who was just here,

552
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:42,194
he was making eyes at me all night.

553
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:43,862
Do you see him in here often?

554
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:45,531
I'm not supposed to
talk about the clientele.

555
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:46,565
Gotcha.

556
00:33:48,201 --> 00:33:50,669
He kept calling me his lucky charm.

557
00:33:50,704 --> 00:33:52,771
I'm not here to be any arm candy,

558
00:33:52,806 --> 00:33:53,806
I'm here to win.

559
00:33:54,341 --> 00:33:55,341
So just tell me this,

560
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:57,910
I'm up two thousand dollars tonight.

561
00:33:59,713 --> 00:34:01,547
Is he walking out of
here with more than that?

562
00:34:02,849 --> 00:34:03,882
'Fraid so.

563
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:04,917
By quite a bit.

564
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:07,720
Did you want to cash out?

565
00:34:09,356 --> 00:34:10,356
Thanks.

566
00:34:22,825 --> 00:34:24,606
I couldn't have been clearer.

567
00:34:24,631 --> 00:34:26,496
I know, sir. I'm sorry.

568
00:34:26,535 --> 00:34:27,387
I made a call.

569
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:29,497
Five years of my life I've
been going after Corbett.

570
00:34:29,531 --> 00:34:30,498
When I started

571
00:34:30,532 --> 00:34:31,499
my kid couldn't walk.

572
00:34:31,533 --> 00:34:33,201
- Now she rides a bike.
- I understand.

573
00:34:33,235 --> 00:34:34,502
So for you to just parachute in

574
00:34:34,536 --> 00:34:36,170
and jeopardize the whole goddamn thing,

575
00:34:36,205 --> 00:34:37,521
it displeases me.

576
00:34:40,376 --> 00:34:41,914
Do you have a cigarette?

577
00:34:43,012 --> 00:34:44,912
- I don't smoke.
- Bull.

578
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,907
I have a good nose.

579
00:34:50,486 --> 00:34:51,753
It did pay off, though.

580
00:34:55,858 --> 00:34:59,642
Last night, it shows how
Cardinal launders his rat money.

581
00:34:59,861 --> 00:35:01,561
He buys black market chips,

582
00:35:01,596 --> 00:35:02,562
cashes them in.

583
00:35:02,597 --> 00:35:03,563
It's good!

584
00:35:03,598 --> 00:35:05,432
Without a connection to Corbett,

585
00:35:05,466 --> 00:35:06,500
it's nothing.

586
00:35:06,534 --> 00:35:07,942
- No...
- It's zero.

587
00:35:12,161 --> 00:35:13,874
Why didn't you tell
me his wife was sick?

588
00:35:15,109 --> 00:35:16,410
What difference does it make?

589
00:35:16,444 --> 00:35:18,445
I don't know. I'm trying
to get in the guy's head.

590
00:35:20,532 --> 00:35:21,581
His bank deposits,

591
00:35:21,616 --> 00:35:22,683
it could help. Did you look?

592
00:35:22,717 --> 00:35:23,717
No, not an option.

593
00:35:24,735 --> 00:35:25,662
The timing could help.

594
00:35:25,693 --> 00:35:26,954
Let's get a warrant, check his accounts.

595
00:35:26,988 --> 00:35:27,988
Delorme, no warrants!

596
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:31,992
I'll manage the case.

597
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:33,860
Stick to your job.

598
00:35:36,798 --> 00:35:38,131
I gotta go.

599
00:35:38,166 --> 00:35:39,299
Cardinal is waiting for me.

600
00:35:39,334 --> 00:35:40,300
Oh good, you can,

601
00:35:40,335 --> 00:35:41,668
I don't know, talk to him.

602
00:35:41,703 --> 00:35:44,004
Make him your pal, Delorme.

603
00:35:44,038 --> 00:35:45,005
Open him.

604
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:46,440
- Do you understand?
- Hey. Yes.

605
00:35:46,474 --> 00:35:48,211
Do you understand how big this is?

606
00:35:49,243 --> 00:35:50,243
I do.

607
00:35:59,581 --> 00:36:00,654
Look,

608
00:36:03,314 --> 00:36:04,424
if this goes well,

609
00:36:06,088 --> 00:36:07,289
it's gonna be good for you.

610
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:11,459
Hm.

611
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:13,628
I'll see to it.

612
00:36:17,748 --> 00:36:19,234
- Hey.
- Hey.

613
00:36:19,268 --> 00:36:20,669
I don't know what your secret is.

614
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,437
What do you mean?

615
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:24,272
Cardinal. You've
turned him right around.

616
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,896
He called you a
promising young detective.

617
00:36:29,946 --> 00:36:30,946
He did?

618
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,516
No, but he said you're not
a complete waste of a badge.

619
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,585
It's a shame you're
only here temporarily.

620
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,820
We could use more like you.

621
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,500
Struck by inspiration?

622
00:36:51,968 --> 00:36:52,968
I was thinking about it.

623
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:55,503
You should come over
to our place one night.

624
00:36:55,538 --> 00:36:56,972
Josh is a pretty good cook.

625
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,006
This is your car.

626
00:36:59,308 --> 00:37:00,308
Yeah.

627
00:37:01,477 --> 00:37:02,595
Why?

628
00:37:02,643 --> 00:37:05,438
You're gonna want to remove
all the identifying features.

629
00:37:06,954 --> 00:37:08,616
You make enemies in this job.

630
00:37:08,651 --> 00:37:09,851
You don't want anything on your car

631
00:37:09,885 --> 00:37:11,086
might catch somebody's eye.

632
00:37:12,588 --> 00:37:13,588
Do you mean that?

633
00:37:15,558 --> 00:37:17,192
My whole league has those.

634
00:37:17,226 --> 00:37:18,626
You see them everywhere.

635
00:37:18,661 --> 00:37:20,685
Why'd you leave Financial Crimes?

636
00:37:23,499 --> 00:37:24,699
You never did tell me.

637
00:37:25,668 --> 00:37:26,668
Just grew out of it.

638
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:32,640
You won't see much of
your team this season.

639
00:37:32,675 --> 00:37:34,509
You're gonna have to
clear your calendar.

640
00:37:37,747 --> 00:37:38,747
Understood.

641
00:37:40,282 --> 00:37:41,282
'Cause he won't stop,

642
00:37:42,118 --> 00:37:43,151
Delorme.

643
00:37:43,185 --> 00:37:44,185
Not until we stop him.

644
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,058
Nothing else matters.

645
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:51,519
Thanks.

646
00:39:22,014 --> 00:39:23,314
Is that your guitar?

647
00:39:23,573 --> 00:39:24,983
Yeah.

648
00:39:25,017 --> 00:39:26,217
- You play it?
- Yeah.

649
00:39:28,253 --> 00:39:30,463
Of course you do.
Sorry. Stupid question.

650
00:39:32,925 --> 00:39:34,547
He's not interested, mutt.

651
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,367
Hey dude, come on.

652
00:39:37,596 --> 00:39:38,858
Oh, you are interested?

653
00:39:39,631 --> 00:39:40,631
My mistake.

654
00:39:43,202 --> 00:39:44,402
What is that on your face?

655
00:39:49,708 --> 00:39:50,875
Is that some kind of burn?

656
00:39:50,909 --> 00:39:52,759
Hey man, mind your own business.

657
00:39:53,946 --> 00:39:54,946
All right.

658
00:39:56,248 --> 00:39:57,548
You're awfully concerned about her man,

659
00:39:57,583 --> 00:39:59,584
maybe you should be more
worried about yourself.

660
00:40:01,693 --> 00:40:02,904
Could be contagious.

661
00:40:03,482 --> 00:40:04,842
Look, nobody was talking to you.

662
00:40:11,296 --> 00:40:14,298
All right. Okay. Come on.

663
00:40:16,135 --> 00:40:17,568
Have a good night, kids.

664
00:40:31,183 --> 00:40:32,151
Thank you.

665
00:40:33,852 --> 00:40:36,054
I seem to bring it out in people.

666
00:40:36,088 --> 00:40:38,122
No, don't blame yourself,

667
00:40:38,157 --> 00:40:39,357
that guy was a head case.

668
00:40:40,926 --> 00:40:41,926
Have a good night.

669
00:40:56,275 --> 00:40:57,475
Can I ask you a favour?

670
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,344
I don't want to be here anymore.

671
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,180
Could you walk me home?

672
00:41:04,049 --> 00:41:05,049
Ah...

673
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:06,984
I don't feel safe with
that guy out there.

674
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,620
I-I just...

675
00:41:10,155 --> 00:41:11,938
My place isn't far.

676
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,561
I just ordered this drink. I'm sorry.

677
00:41:17,463 --> 00:41:19,063
I could call you a cab if you want.

678
00:41:21,467 --> 00:41:22,983
Don't bother.

679
00:41:50,229 --> 00:41:51,229
Where's your friend?

680
00:41:55,334 --> 00:41:56,868
You thought he was gonna walk you home

681
00:41:56,902 --> 00:41:57,902
like a gentleman.

682
00:41:59,438 --> 00:42:01,462
Is that impossible to imagine?

683
00:42:04,009 --> 00:42:05,579
You're asking the wrong questions.

684
00:42:06,745 --> 00:42:08,212
It doesn't matter how nice he is.

685
00:42:08,247 --> 00:42:09,313
It matters to me.

686
00:42:09,348 --> 00:42:10,348
It shouldn't.

687
00:42:12,017 --> 00:42:13,017
It can't.

688
00:42:17,356 --> 00:42:18,556
Did you give it to him?

689
00:42:21,426 --> 00:42:23,594
While you were insulting me.

690
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:25,930
We can still drive away,

691
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,199
leave him behind.

692
00:42:30,802 --> 00:42:31,769
Is that what you want?

693
00:42:39,711 --> 00:42:40,711
We're doing this.

694
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:44,578
