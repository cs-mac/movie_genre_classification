1
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,957
He's lying.

2
00:00:18,368 --> 00:00:22,202
This son of a bitch
has been playing us the whole time.

3
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:25,571
- No. No, wait.
- You really think we're that dumb? Huh?

4
00:00:25,642 --> 00:00:27,906
- No, I didn't say
- Easy. I didn't say-

5
00:00:27,977 --> 00:00:30,002
No! No!

6
00:00:38,488 --> 00:00:42,356
<i>Dream, send me a sign</i>

7
00:00:42,425 --> 00:00:44,484
<i>Turn back the clock</i>

8
00:00:44,561 --> 00:00:47,189
<i>Give me some time</i>

9
00:00:47,263 --> 00:00:50,391
<i>I need to break out</i>

10
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:53,027
<i>Make a new name</i>

11
00:00:53,103 --> 00:00:55,264
<i>Let's open our eyes</i>

12
00:00:55,338 --> 00:00:59,570
<i>To the brand-new day</i>

13
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:07,711
Expenses and overtime are two areas
we should really take a look at.

14
00:01:07,784 --> 00:01:10,947
And we should consider changing
our company investments portfolio.

15
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:15,749
- You've started dating again, haven't you? Yeah.
- Oh, stop it, Cal. Right now.

16
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:19,226
- Right. Um, stockbroker?
Money manager? Banker?

17
00:01:19,295 --> 00:01:21,229
Oh, I thought you wanted to have some fun.

18
00:01:21,297 --> 00:01:23,231
- Oh, I'm having fun. Don't you worry.
- Oh, yeah?

19
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:25,130
Yes, Torres?

20
00:01:25,201 --> 00:01:28,932
Uh, there's a visitor in your office.
Sally Robinson from London.

21
00:01:31,474 --> 00:01:33,442
What?

22
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,774
- Whoa. Sally who?
- Uh, Robinson.

23
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,779
High school sweetheart or something?

24
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:41,078
- In my office?
- Uh-huh.

25
00:01:46,055 --> 00:01:49,115
Gotcha!

26
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:52,719
- God Almighty.
- Yeah, but my mates still call me Terry.

27
00:01:52,796 --> 00:01:55,526
Come here.

28
00:01:55,598 --> 00:01:59,557
Sally Robinson, eh? Hello.
Is that a canoe in your pocket there, Cal?

29
00:01:59,636 --> 00:02:02,070
- Nicely played there, Mia.
- Ria.

30
00:02:02,138 --> 00:02:04,003
- Oh, well. Thank you anyway.
- Mm-hmm.

31
00:02:04,073 --> 00:02:07,907
Excuse his manners.
Terry Marsh, his ex-partner in crime.

32
00:02:07,977 --> 00:02:11,105
- In a manner of speaking.
- Gillian Foster, current partner in crime.

33
00:02:11,181 --> 00:02:12,842
- Nice to meet you, Terry.
- You too.

34
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:16,374
All right. That's enough of that.
Good-bye, Dr. Foster.

35
00:02:16,452 --> 00:02:18,750
Wow, Cal, that is so charming.

36
00:02:18,822 --> 00:02:20,483
Well, it's been 22 years, hasn't it?

37
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23,424
Listen, Jill, you fancy
meeting us for a drink later?

38
00:02:23,493 --> 00:02:26,155
It's Gillian, actually. And she's busy.

39
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:29,289
- I'll take it.
- Call me if you need me.

40
00:02:29,365 --> 00:02:31,026
- Listen-
- Oil

41
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,091
Yes.

42
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:35,603
Who we drinking to?

43
00:02:35,672 --> 00:02:38,800
Um, how 'bout Sally Robinson,
wherever she may be?

44
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:41,036
You wanker.

45
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:49,576
- You all right there, Terry?
- Don't start that bollocks with me, Cal.

46
00:02:49,652 --> 00:02:52,815
- What?
- With the eyes, like you're reading my fortune.

47
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:55,756
I'm just pleased to see you, really.

48
00:02:57,794 --> 00:03:00,490
Though a touch curious as to why now.

49
00:03:00,563 --> 00:03:04,659
Well, truth be told, I've thought twice
about looking you up loads of times.

50
00:03:04,734 --> 00:03:07,703
Terry Marsh thinking twice.
Well, that's a first, innit?

51
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,967
- Come on.
- Come on where?

52
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,009
I tell you what, Cal.
I'll do a deal with you.

53
00:03:14,077 --> 00:03:17,240
What's past is past. What's done is done.

54
00:03:17,313 --> 00:03:21,511
It's just all...
water under the bridge. Fair?

55
00:03:24,754 --> 00:03:27,655
Uh- Water under the bridge then.

56
00:03:38,735 --> 00:03:40,669
Oh. Hello, lovely lady.

57
00:03:40,737 --> 00:03:43,205
- I'm Terry.
- Hi.

58
00:03:43,273 --> 00:03:47,573
- You should say hello to my dad.
- Hi, Dad. I'm Kara.

59
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,771
- This is Alice.
- Stage names?

60
00:03:49,846 --> 00:03:52,041
Oh, down, Dad, down. Forgive him.

61
00:03:56,352 --> 00:03:59,287
Right?

62
00:03:59,355 --> 00:04:02,256
Oh, feast your eyes. Hey, Cal.

63
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,350
No. Not that way.

64
00:04:06,095 --> 00:04:08,029
Over there, son.

65
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:13,701
- I don't play cards anymore.
- Look at me very carefully, Cal.

66
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,102
I did not get this jailbird for nothing.

67
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:18,106
Don't make me say it.

68
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:21,143
I owe you my life.
There you go. I said it.

69
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:24,737
Do this for me tonight,
and then we're all square.

70
00:04:26,215 --> 00:04:29,912
- How much do you owe 'em?
- Twelve large.

71
00:04:29,986 --> 00:04:31,851
- Twelve grand?
- It'll be like the old days, you know?

72
00:04:31,921 --> 00:04:34,321
- I'll do all the talking, and you do the-
- Yeah, yeah, science. Yeah.

73
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:38,224
Yeah, well- It's Texas hold 'em, no limit...

74
00:04:38,294 --> 00:04:41,320
and this is my last two grand
in the world.

75
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:47,731
- Right.
- Cheers. Come on.

76
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:52,306
I think I've had
a bit too much to drink for this, Terry.

77
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,707
Yeah. Well, that's rubbish. But nice try.

78
00:04:56,946 --> 00:05:00,279
Hey, Terry.
You're feeling' luckier tonight?

79
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:03,808
Hey, gents. An old mate of mine,
Harry Sloan from N.Y.C.

80
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:05,820
How you doin'?

81
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,524
Hey, Foster. Have you seen Lightman?

82
00:05:09,592 --> 00:05:11,253
He's taking a personal day.

83
00:05:11,327 --> 00:05:13,795
Yeah, he's with a man who's on
a Scotland Yard watch list...

84
00:05:13,863 --> 00:05:16,889
which means when he's over here,
he's on an F.B.I. watch list.

85
00:05:16,966 --> 00:05:19,230
It's part of the special relationship
with the Brits.

86
00:05:19,302 --> 00:05:20,963
What's Terry done wrong?

87
00:05:21,037 --> 00:05:24,029
Nothing recently. Watch lists
are more precautionary than anything else.

88
00:05:24,107 --> 00:05:26,940
Yet your tone is telling me
it's more than just a heads-up.

89
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:30,502
Then it should also be telling you that
I'm not at liberty to discuss this any further.

90
00:05:33,016 --> 00:05:36,213
"G.B.H. Grievous Bodily Harm. "
Twenty-two years ago?

91
00:05:36,285 --> 00:05:39,152
They want you to dig into
Lightman's past with Terry?

92
00:05:39,222 --> 00:05:42,487
Let's just say it's his immediate future
I'm more worried about.

93
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:51,462
Thousand.

94
00:05:51,534 --> 00:05:53,195
I fold.

95
00:05:55,571 --> 00:05:57,505
Call.

96
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:05,580
Thousand.

97
00:06:09,085 --> 00:06:11,019
You okay, Terry?

98
00:06:12,722 --> 00:06:15,190
I'm good for it, Lance. You know I am.

99
00:06:15,258 --> 00:06:19,217
I know you are. We're all gentlemen here.
Someone get this man a drink.

100
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,160
Thanks.

101
00:06:23,933 --> 00:06:26,197
Call.

102
00:06:44,087 --> 00:06:45,748
All in.

103
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:00,729
- I said-
- I heard you the first time.

104
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,307
Call.

105
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:17,943
Ten high.

106
00:07:22,825 --> 00:07:24,793
You called me on a jack high?
That's ridiculous.

107
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,920
Apparently not.

108
00:07:26,996 --> 00:07:31,057
Gentlemen, it's been a pleasure.

109
00:07:31,134 --> 00:07:33,898
Listen, could we have, um,
a little break, please?

110
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,302
Just a minute, huh?

111
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:39,102
Why not? Order up some eggs.

112
00:07:40,176 --> 00:07:41,837
Cheers.

113
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,320
Do you mind?

114
00:08:08,137 --> 00:08:11,334
Harry Sloan from
New York City? You're out of your bloody mind.

115
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,739
Quiet!

116
00:08:13,809 --> 00:08:15,470
I could hardly say you're Dr. Lightman...

117
00:08:15,545 --> 00:08:18,139
the lie expert and the reader
of faces, now could I?

118
00:08:18,214 --> 00:08:21,706
So the 12 grand was just a teaser
to get me in the game, is that it?

119
00:08:21,784 --> 00:08:26,847
How much do you owe this psychopath? Oil

120
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,187
- How much?
- Ninety-five.

121
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:31,055
- Ninety-five grand?
- Yeah.

122
00:08:31,127 --> 00:08:33,891
You expect me to take that kind of money
off these men...

123
00:08:33,963 --> 00:08:35,931
instead of just walking out of here
while I still can?

124
00:08:35,998 --> 00:08:37,693
- 'Scuse me.
- Hey. No, no, no, no.

125
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:41,066
Cal. You know exactly
what's gonna happen to me if you walk away.

126
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:51,407
So is this a prank
or a serious death threat?

127
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,540
Very soon now, you will all be sorry.

128
00:08:55,885 --> 00:09:01,255
It's all gonna end this week.
The pain will stop.

129
00:09:01,324 --> 00:09:03,656
Uniforms. Private school?

130
00:09:03,726 --> 00:09:05,387
Uh, college preparatory.

131
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,526
You the only one this video was sent to,
Mr. Anders?

132
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:14,229
As far as I know. It was, uh, left
on my desk during the lunch hour...

133
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,237
in an envelope marked
"Headmaster. Urgent. "

134
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,296
Has anyone else seen the tape?

135
00:09:18,374 --> 00:09:20,604
Just the F.B.I.- and now you.

136
00:09:20,676 --> 00:09:23,577
- Have you closed the school?
- School’s out for the rest of today.

137
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,843
- My first piece of advice to you, close the school.
- For how long?

138
00:09:28,517 --> 00:09:31,213
Until we determine who made this.

139
00:09:31,287 --> 00:09:34,188
So indefinitely.

140
00:09:34,257 --> 00:09:38,057
Dr. Foster, do you realize what that would
do to us? That would ruin our school.

141
00:09:38,127 --> 00:09:40,186
So this is about money?

142
00:09:40,263 --> 00:09:44,029
From handwriting analysis
on the envelopes, student files...

143
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,160
locker searches and security camera tapes...

144
00:09:47,236 --> 00:09:51,434
agents on site were able to make a preliminary
list of students who might fit the profile.

145
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:54,965
Twenty-five names?
Fit the profile for what?

146
00:09:55,044 --> 00:09:58,377
- Homicidal intent.
- Oh, God.

147
00:09:58,447 --> 00:10:01,075
First of all, hands up,
who's heard of the Lightman Group?

148
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:04,916
All right. Well, we are scientists
who interpret human emotions.

149
00:10:04,987 --> 00:10:06,648
And this morning, with your help...

150
00:10:06,722 --> 00:10:09,282
I'm gonna run an experiment,
which should be quite informative.

151
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:13,124
So rather than listen to me drone on all day,
let's just get started, shall we?

152
00:10:21,337 --> 00:10:25,740
Very soon now, you will all be sorry.

153
00:10:25,808 --> 00:10:30,177
It's all gonna end this week.
The pain will stop.

154
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:47,855
No one's that good.
You two are working together.

155
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,990
Who is he, Terry? You cheating me?

156
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:55,026
'Cause I will put a bullet in your head.

157
00:10:55,104 --> 00:10:59,268
There's 105 grand there.
You and Terry are even now.

158
00:10:59,342 --> 00:11:01,833
You keep the change.

159
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,776
We're all gentlemen here.

160
00:11:03,846 --> 00:11:06,440
At least for now,
with all those witnesses in the next room.

161
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:12,680
I said he keeps the change.

162
00:11:26,369 --> 00:11:28,894
Mate, say something.

163
00:11:28,971 --> 00:11:31,963
You're welcome. Don't mention it.

164
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:34,509
I love you, Cal. Don't forget that.

165
00:11:34,577 --> 00:11:36,636
Yeah. I'll see you in another 22 years.

166
00:11:37,913 --> 00:11:39,847
Mount Vernon Square.

167
00:11:46,489 --> 00:11:49,515
Rough night, huh?

168
00:11:49,592 --> 00:11:52,959
- Yup. No rest for the wicked.
- Yeah.

169
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:55,053
Something tells me you already know that.

170
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,792
You want to know what else I know?

171
00:11:56,866 --> 00:11:58,527
You know your buddy, Terry Marsh?

172
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:00,535
Spent three years
in Belmarsh Prison in England-

173
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:03,401
'87 to '90- for assault and battery.

174
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,372
Yeah. It was a long time ago.

175
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:07,966
And he's gone now, and I'm tired...

176
00:12:08,043 --> 00:12:10,102
and I'm hung over,
and it's none of your business.

177
00:12:10,179 --> 00:12:12,374
No. You made it my business
when you spent the night...

178
00:12:12,448 --> 00:12:14,109
at the penthouse suite at the Park Hotel...

179
00:12:14,183 --> 00:12:17,380
where there were prostitutes
and illegal gambling.

180
00:12:17,453 --> 00:12:19,318
Those women were prostitutes?

181
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:23,450
How did you know?

182
00:12:23,526 --> 00:12:26,359
Did you follow us? That's interesting.

183
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:34,897
There. Surprise and shame
in less than a second, then nothing.

184
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,904
Pulling down the mask.
Put her on the list.

185
00:12:36,972 --> 00:12:39,532
- Hey.
- Hey.

186
00:12:39,608 --> 00:12:42,076
Oh. Go back a few seconds, would you?

187
00:12:42,144 --> 00:12:44,305
There you go. Right. See this girl?

188
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:47,110
Same girl. She glances at the teacher.
There you go. See?

189
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,946
And he catches her eye. Yeah?

190
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:50,713
He's got his eye on her for some reason.

191
00:12:50,786 --> 00:12:52,947
So does this girl here. Look.

192
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,685
Then she looks over at that guy.

193
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,627
Nice one, Loker.

194
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:05,391
Soon you'll be asking me for a raise,
which I've been assured that we can't afford.

195
00:13:05,468 --> 00:13:07,834
So... stand down.

196
00:13:07,903 --> 00:13:10,963
Right. Well, keep watching the tape then.

197
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,065
- Be back in a minute.
- You look awful.

198
00:13:13,142 --> 00:13:15,440
And yet, I feel so much worse.

199
00:13:26,188 --> 00:13:29,589
I said 22 years, not 22 minutes.

200
00:13:29,658 --> 00:13:32,821
We're in a lot of trouble, Cal.

201
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,227
They know who you are and what you do...

202
00:13:35,297 --> 00:13:37,959
- and they ain't happy.
- What do they want?

203
00:13:38,033 --> 00:13:40,968
They want to see you saw a girl in half.
What do you think they want?

204
00:13:41,036 --> 00:13:43,834
They want you to be their magic man...

205
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,067
and they're waiting for you
around the corner, in a van.

206
00:13:46,141 --> 00:13:49,838
And if you don't come now,
then... I'm done.

207
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,044
As in "dead" done.

208
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:03,350
- Yeah, I'll see what I can find out from him.
- Hey.

209
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:06,656
Hey. Your buddy's lost his F.B.I. tail.

210
00:14:06,729 --> 00:14:10,631
- Now, do you have any clue on where he could be right now?
- Yeah. Come with me.

211
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,598
- He's in my office.
- He's in your office?

212
00:14:17,673 --> 00:14:19,664
- Yep.
- What the hell is he doin' in there?

213
00:14:19,742 --> 00:14:23,075
- I've got a major bloody problem here.
- You're damn right, you do.

214
00:14:23,145 --> 00:14:26,876
You do understand that Terry's involved
with an extremely dangerous criminal, right?

215
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,509
- Lance McClellan.
- Lance McClellan. Exactly.

216
00:14:29,585 --> 00:14:32,520
He's a new-school crime boss- educated,
well connected, hidden in plain sight.

217
00:14:32,588 --> 00:14:34,249
This ends now.

218
00:14:34,323 --> 00:14:36,848
Look, Terry's family to me. There's no way
I'm gonna let him hang himself.

219
00:14:36,926 --> 00:14:39,417
- I'm not gonna let him hang you, either.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

220
00:14:39,495 --> 00:14:42,259
- What's McClellan’s game?
- It depends.

221
00:14:42,331 --> 00:14:44,765
Which means you don't know, right?

222
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:47,996
That means that you're gonna help me
help Terry to help you.

223
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,867
If anyone's helping anyone here...

224
00:14:49,939 --> 00:14:52,965
it's gonna be you helping to bring down
McClellan and Terry.

225
00:14:53,042 --> 00:14:55,909
And I know he's your friend,
but those guys are bad sons of bitches.

226
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:59,209
Look, McClellan sent Terry for me, which
means he needs something from me, right?

227
00:14:59,281 --> 00:15:00,942
And whatever it is, he needs it quick.

228
00:15:01,016 --> 00:15:03,951
If you're suggesting what I think you're
suggesting, you can forget it, okay?

229
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:05,680
You're not a trained undercover agent.

230
00:15:05,754 --> 00:15:08,154
- Knock it off. I'm doing this.
- Not if I arrest you, you're not.

231
00:15:08,223 --> 00:15:10,054
- You're gonna arrest me?
- Yeah.

232
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,956
I won over a hundred grand
in cards last night.

233
00:15:12,027 --> 00:15:14,928
- I know a bluff when I see one.
You're not arresting me.

234
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,625
And you keep Foster out of this, all right?

235
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:20,794
- Okay.
- Her focus needs to be 100% on that school.

236
00:15:20,869 --> 00:15:23,337
And I'm banking on you
to have my back for this.

237
00:15:23,405 --> 00:15:26,772
- Oh, you mean like a real F.B.I. agent.
- Something like that, yeah.

238
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,503
Hey. So we're meeting
in the conference room.

239
00:15:28,577 --> 00:15:30,875
- Torres is in there with three kids from the school.
- All right.

240
00:15:30,946 --> 00:15:35,576
- So... what's wrong?
- Nothing.

241
00:15:35,651 --> 00:15:38,711
Look, Reynolds was just
telling me what a bad seed Terry was...

242
00:15:38,787 --> 00:15:40,448
and it came as a bit of a shock...

243
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,581
'cause there was I,
thinking that he was a choirboy.

244
00:15:48,497 --> 00:15:50,158
All right.

245
00:15:50,232 --> 00:15:53,133
Stand up. Stand up. Stand up.

246
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,760
All right. When'd you make the video?

247
00:15:54,837 --> 00:15:55,929
- What? I-
- What's your name again?

248
00:15:56,005 --> 00:15:57,836
- I didn't make it.
- Exploding buildings.

249
00:15:57,906 --> 00:16:01,103
- That was news footage, right? Your name is-
- Stacey.

250
00:16:01,176 --> 00:16:04,111
- Stacey.
- I-I don't know. Probably. I couldn't-

251
00:16:04,179 --> 00:16:06,079
I'm the one who made that video.

252
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:10,346
- Jared?
- Jared Rollins is my name.

253
00:16:10,419 --> 00:16:12,080
I made the video.

254
00:16:12,154 --> 00:16:15,282
Get your hands out of your pockets.

255
00:16:15,357 --> 00:16:19,987
So what's the plan, eh?
This a bombing or a shooting or what?

256
00:16:21,296 --> 00:16:23,264
'Cause you know
there always is a plan, right?

257
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,128
You tell me.

258
00:16:31,106 --> 00:16:34,007
So when did you make the video, Jared?

259
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:37,136
- What does it matter? - Well, I-I thought
it would've mattered a great deal to you.

260
00:16:37,212 --> 00:16:39,976
I made the video.
That's all you need to know.

261
00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:42,108
Well, who did you send it to?

262
00:16:42,184 --> 00:16:44,709
What?

263
00:16:44,787 --> 00:16:47,813
That stall right there?
He's Lying. He didn't make it.

264
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:50,552
Jared, why would you lie
about making that video?

265
00:16:50,626 --> 00:16:54,392
Because maybe they all deserve to die,
or at least worry about it.

266
00:16:54,463 --> 00:16:57,728
- Who?
- They know who they are.

267
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,030
If he didn't make the video,
he sure wishes he had.

268
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:04,402
His face, body language-
That's homicidal intent, right?

269
00:17:04,473 --> 00:17:06,464
Yeah.

270
00:17:09,211 --> 00:17:10,872
- Your name is-
- Stacey.

271
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,675
Stacey. That was news footage?

272
00:17:12,748 --> 00:17:14,909
I- I don't know. Probably.

273
00:17:14,983 --> 00:17:18,384
- I'm the one who made the video.
- Jared?

274
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,082
Jared Rollins is my name.

275
00:17:21,156 --> 00:17:23,147
Okay. When he said he made the video...

276
00:17:23,225 --> 00:17:25,989
he deliberately interrupted Stacey.

277
00:17:26,061 --> 00:17:27,995
Yeah. She's relieved.

278
00:17:29,398 --> 00:17:31,389
He's covering for her.
He's protecting her.

279
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,204
Oh, nice shirt. Help yourself?

280
00:17:41,276 --> 00:17:43,005
I thought you'd fallen in.

281
00:17:43,078 --> 00:17:45,546
Right now, that'd be a quality problem.
How's your hand?

282
00:17:45,614 --> 00:17:48,845
Ah, it's all right.

283
00:17:48,917 --> 00:17:52,580
I don't normally approve of torture,
but in your case, as it's personal-

284
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:55,885
What's going on, Terry?
Eh? What's going on?

285
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,449
You all right? You all right?

286
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,426
You remember those, uh-

287
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,728
- the property flips we used to do back in London?
- Yeah.

288
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,861
I only broke in and sold
the wrong man's Miami mansion.

289
00:18:08,937 --> 00:18:10,768
But it turns out-

290
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,205
he was connected.

291
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:17,677
Answer the question, all right? All right?

292
00:18:17,746 --> 00:18:19,714
- What you draggin' me into?
- I don't-

293
00:18:19,782 --> 00:18:24,549
- Huh? Eh?
- I don't know. I swear to God, Cal. I do not know.

294
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:31,453
Well, come on then.

295
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,462
Thank you.

296
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,964
Oh, shut up.

297
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,057
So the video...

298
00:18:39,134 --> 00:18:41,568
even though you didn't make it,
does speak to your needs.

299
00:18:41,637 --> 00:18:46,165
And which is partly
why you took false credit.

300
00:18:46,241 --> 00:18:49,733
And you say they deserve to die,
but you're clearly scared to name them.

301
00:18:51,413 --> 00:18:54,348
Loker, take Jared
back to the conference room.

302
00:18:54,416 --> 00:18:56,441
I need to talk to Stacey now.

303
00:18:57,853 --> 00:18:59,616
We're done.

304
00:19:05,527 --> 00:19:07,256
Where's Lightman?

305
00:19:07,329 --> 00:19:09,991
He's not in his office. We keep calling,
but it's going straight to voice mail.

306
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,397
Where could he be? That's not like him.

307
00:19:12,467 --> 00:19:14,128
- Will you keep trying?
- Yeah.

308
00:19:16,505 --> 00:19:19,804
All right. Let's go.

309
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,638
Hold up till we get the door.

310
00:19:26,215 --> 00:19:27,876
Straight ahead.

311
00:19:30,219 --> 00:19:34,656
Dr. Lightman. Good of you to come.

312
00:19:37,893 --> 00:19:41,056
- I warn you, I'm not cheap.
- Oh. Terry's life cover it?

313
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,255
Barely.

314
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:47,131
We have a deal then.

315
00:19:47,202 --> 00:19:49,762
I like to think
of all of my people as family...

316
00:19:49,838 --> 00:19:54,172
but one of these three has been informing
on me to the government.

317
00:19:54,243 --> 00:19:58,407
Now you're going to tell me
for certain which one is the rat.

318
00:20:00,148 --> 00:20:03,413
- What, so you can kill the man?
- Three minutes, Dr. Lightman.

319
00:20:07,556 --> 00:20:09,217
All right then.

320
00:20:15,197 --> 00:20:17,495
All right, boys?

321
00:20:25,874 --> 00:20:27,865
Well, you're right.

322
00:20:29,912 --> 00:20:32,437
There is a liar in the room.

323
00:20:33,849 --> 00:20:35,783
Liar's you.

324
00:20:35,851 --> 00:20:38,718
What are you doing?

325
00:20:38,787 --> 00:20:41,119
- Now's not the time to play
the comedian, all right?

326
00:20:42,524 --> 00:20:45,459
- Get up.
- Just give him one more chance.

327
00:20:45,527 --> 00:20:47,995
He won't let you down. Will you?

328
00:20:48,063 --> 00:20:51,555
None of these men is an informer!

329
00:20:51,633 --> 00:20:56,229
But you already knew that, didn't you? Eh?

330
00:20:56,305 --> 00:20:58,796
Good.

331
00:20:58,874 --> 00:21:00,865
Yeah. Told you he was the best, didn't I?

332
00:21:00,943 --> 00:21:04,470
Yeah. What I want to know is
when you told him that, Terry?

333
00:21:04,546 --> 00:21:07,276
Was it last night?
Last week? Last month?

334
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,340
Quiet, ladies.

335
00:21:10,652 --> 00:21:12,677
Nice one, Terry.

336
00:21:15,924 --> 00:21:19,587
Stacey, are you and- and Jasmine friends?

337
00:21:21,063 --> 00:21:25,056
The exact same look she showed
for Jasmine in class- contempt.

338
00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:28,500
She's mean to me- in P.E...

339
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:31,130
in the locker room.

340
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:35,336
But she's not the only one. I hate P.E.

341
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,241
Well, did you tell your teacher?

342
00:21:37,312 --> 00:21:39,075
He knows.

343
00:21:41,249 --> 00:21:43,513
Stacey, I wish I didn't
have to ask you this...

344
00:21:43,585 --> 00:21:49,182
but do you ever wish Jasmine, or any of
the other kids who were mean to you, harm?

345
00:21:49,257 --> 00:21:52,852
Harm? Like-

346
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:57,262
You think I made
that video, and that it was-

347
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,627
I may have thought about revenge, but...

348
00:22:02,637 --> 00:22:04,696
I don't want them to die.

349
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,539
She's telling the truth.
She doesn't want to harm anyone.

350
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:13,443
Please don't tell Jasmine I told on her.

351
00:22:13,515 --> 00:22:15,346
Oh, sweetie, uh-

352
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,510
Maybe she is the one who made the video...

353
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,885
and all this is her fantasy revenge.

354
00:22:20,956 --> 00:22:22,617
Uh, who's the P.E. teacher?

355
00:22:22,691 --> 00:22:24,522
- Why?
- It's not you, is it?

356
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,824
Yeah, but I would never
turn a blind eye to bullying if I saw it.

357
00:22:27,896 --> 00:22:30,330
Did you know that these kids
were picking on Stacey?

358
00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:32,993
Well, I could see
she wasn't the most popular.

359
00:22:33,068 --> 00:22:37,528
- Is Jasmine popular?
- Yeah, I'd say so. Very, actually.

360
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:40,473
It's always the popular ones
who think they can get away with murder.

361
00:22:40,542 --> 00:22:43,909
- Spoken like a true scientist.
- Trust me. I just know.

362
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:48,381
We should get Jasmine in there now.

363
00:22:50,252 --> 00:22:53,380
So, you two go back a ways.

364
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:55,821
Well, I'm sure Terry's
told you all about it.

365
00:22:55,891 --> 00:22:58,121
Property scams.

366
00:22:58,193 --> 00:23:00,354
You picked out the easy marks.

367
00:23:00,429 --> 00:23:02,158
Terry took 'em for everything they had.

368
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,755
Yeah. If that's how Terry remembers it.

369
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:07,734
I remember you were the business
at picking out just the right mark.

370
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:11,500
I mean, he was
the absolute bloody business. I swear.

371
00:23:11,573 --> 00:23:16,909
Hmm. Terry tells me that you owe him
your life, Dr. Lightman. Tell me about that.

372
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,615
I thought it was water under the bridge.

373
00:23:21,683 --> 00:23:25,016
Even so. While we're waiting.

374
00:23:25,087 --> 00:23:29,183
Well, suffice to say, we were, um,
West Ham supporters at a Millwall game.

375
00:23:29,257 --> 00:23:32,693
He saved you from soccer hooligans.

376
00:23:32,761 --> 00:23:36,424
- Manner of speaking.
- Or... were you two the hooligans?

377
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,966
Not guilty, Your Honor.

378
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:45,103
You see that look, Terry?

379
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:48,939
That look says that your time
on this planet is running out.

380
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,444
Yeah. Put a cork in it, Cal,
all right? That's enough.

381
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:55,574
See, it's always the same, the criminal mind,
you know? Never sees the end of the road.

382
00:23:55,650 --> 00:24:00,383
Forever hoping, often actually believing
that there'll be just one more corner to turn.

383
00:24:00,455 --> 00:24:02,719
Not his fault.

384
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:05,726
He's not the only one.
I'm basically wired the same way.

385
00:24:05,794 --> 00:24:07,557
Right.

386
00:24:07,629 --> 00:24:10,621
They're on their way. Five minutes out.

387
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,599
- Who?
- The man that you're gonna meet with...

388
00:24:12,667 --> 00:24:15,602
see if he's on the level or not
before I do business with him.

389
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:18,400
- Call him back. Cancel it.
- Excuse me?

390
00:24:18,473 --> 00:24:21,408
- What?
- Look out the window.

391
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:26,113
Right. There's an F.B.I. tail out there.

392
00:24:26,181 --> 00:24:28,741
They've been on Terry
like a cheap suit since he landed.

393
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:36,319
Don't play games, Professor.

394
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,416
You can thank me later.

395
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:42,929
Show me.

396
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:47,967
- See it?
- The blue one.

397
00:24:48,036 --> 00:24:50,470
No, not- not the blue one. The other one.

398
00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:53,337
The one over from it.
The red one. The red station wagon.

399
00:24:55,443 --> 00:24:58,708
Might as well have had a blue light
flashing on top, know what I mean?

400
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,941
Call back. Change the meet
to the warehouse.

401
00:25:02,217 --> 00:25:03,878
Get up!

402
00:25:03,952 --> 00:25:08,616
A lot of people think that it's just
the victims of bullies who get hurt.

403
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:12,148
But the bullies pay a price too.

404
00:25:13,528 --> 00:25:15,393
You know, maybe not physically, but-

405
00:25:15,463 --> 00:25:17,693
We were just joking around at first.

406
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,563
Yeah? About what? Stacey's weight?

407
00:25:19,634 --> 00:25:22,467
That and-

408
00:25:22,537 --> 00:25:27,907
Uh- I can't explain.
It got out of control.

409
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:32,242
- I'm so sorry.
- Are you, though?

410
00:25:34,082 --> 00:25:38,348
It wasn't just me. There are others.

411
00:25:39,554 --> 00:25:43,251
If that video means what I think it means...

412
00:25:43,325 --> 00:25:45,623
then it's all coming to an end.

413
00:25:45,694 --> 00:25:50,063
The pain- her pain, mine. I wish it would.

414
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:54,864
I hate myself for what I did to Stacey,
but I couldn't stop.

415
00:25:54,936 --> 00:25:58,235
- He didn't want us to.
- "He" meaning you.

416
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:00,171
- Hmm?
- And you still mean to tell me...

417
00:26:00,242 --> 00:26:01,903
you had no idea this was going on?

418
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,535
I can't be everywhere all the time.

419
00:26:03,612 --> 00:26:05,671
Ducks the question
while grabbing for an excuse.

420
00:26:05,747 --> 00:26:07,339
Yeah. Classic deflection.

421
00:26:07,415 --> 00:26:11,249
If Stacey made that video,
it's because of me.

422
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,289
- Where's Stacey?
- She went to the bathroom.

423
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:19,918
- How long ago?
- Few minutes.

424
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,587
More like 10, I think.

425
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,597
Stacey?

426
00:26:25,033 --> 00:26:26,728
Stacey!

427
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:30,335
Stacey. Come on. Open up now, please.

428
00:26:37,045 --> 00:26:38,945
- Stacey.
- I can't find a pulse.

429
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,743
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

430
00:26:40,815 --> 00:26:42,544
I missed it. It wasn't homicidal intent.

431
00:26:42,617 --> 00:26:46,109
I misread the sadness.
It was suicidal intent.

432
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:47,916
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, I need an ambulance.

433
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:52,719
Bring her around the alley!

434
00:27:03,738 --> 00:27:06,468
All right. Let's go.
But stay three cars behind.

435
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:26,360
Dr. Powers, I. C. U.-

436
00:27:26,428 --> 00:27:29,261
- The parents have been contacted, right?
- It's been taken care of.

437
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,599
Tell me she's gonna be okay.

438
00:27:34,669 --> 00:27:37,433
- Wait out here.
- Monitor's on the way.

439
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,772
She's gonna be okay.

440
00:28:01,396 --> 00:28:03,057
Go!

441
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:13,832
Stay here. Talk amongst yourselves.

442
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:25,075
- Was there really an F.B.I. tail?
- Yep.

443
00:28:25,153 --> 00:28:27,121
- And you just ditched them?
- Yeah. To earn his trust.

444
00:28:27,188 --> 00:28:29,156
Oh, well, that worked like a charm, Cal.

445
00:28:29,224 --> 00:28:30,987
We got blindfolds and locked doors.

446
00:28:32,761 --> 00:28:36,197
Are we even yet, Terry?

447
00:28:36,264 --> 00:28:38,027
Are we ever gonna be even in your eyes?

448
00:28:38,099 --> 00:28:40,693
You think that's what this is about-
it's about who's even with who?

449
00:28:40,769 --> 00:28:42,532
That's a bit rich coming from you, mate.

450
00:28:42,604 --> 00:28:46,335
Oi, mate. I did three years
in prison, saving your ass.

451
00:28:46,408 --> 00:28:48,433
So what have I gotta do?
Die to save yours?

452
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:51,445
You should've come to me in the first place.
You should've been honest with me.

453
00:28:51,513 --> 00:28:53,447
You should've said,
"Cal, I'm in a bit of bother...

454
00:28:53,515 --> 00:28:56,006
could use some help from
a friend I know I can count on. "

455
00:28:56,084 --> 00:28:58,917
- And you would've done what?
- I don't know. I'd have done something!

456
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,717
- Anything's better than this.
- I haven't heard from you in over 20 years, mate.

457
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,451
Over 20 years!

458
00:29:05,093 --> 00:29:06,958
Why was that?

459
00:29:09,864 --> 00:29:13,459
Let's just face it here. You wanted
the past dead, and me along with it.

460
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:19,796
Apology accepted, by the way.

461
00:29:39,327 --> 00:29:41,659
Where the hell is Lightman?

462
00:29:45,567 --> 00:29:48,730
My financial adviser, Harry Sloan.

463
00:29:48,803 --> 00:29:50,794
How do you do?

464
00:29:51,906 --> 00:29:53,999
I see you two already know each other.

465
00:29:54,075 --> 00:29:56,600
Well, any-
any friend of Terry's is a friend of mine.

466
00:29:56,678 --> 00:29:59,613
So, pleasantries out of the way.

467
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:01,649
Let's get down to the heart of the matter,
shall we?

468
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:06,415
The merchandise, Mr. Jones. You say
it is the best ever- flawless, in fact.

469
00:30:06,488 --> 00:30:08,683
I gave you my word. Man to man.

470
00:30:08,756 --> 00:30:10,417
See, now, that's why I'm here.

471
00:30:10,492 --> 00:30:13,359
- Yes or no questions, they only go so far.
- Uh-huh?

472
00:30:13,428 --> 00:30:17,592
So... how flawless is the merchandise?

473
00:30:17,665 --> 00:30:20,657
The currency is perfect.

474
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,966
There's a flicker of doubt there...

475
00:30:24,038 --> 00:30:26,268
but that might just be
about the deal in general.

476
00:30:26,341 --> 00:30:28,935
I mean, "perfect counterfeit currency. "

477
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:31,376
That's an oxymoron
if ever I heard one, right?

478
00:30:31,446 --> 00:30:33,812
What is this sideshow, huh?

479
00:30:33,882 --> 00:30:36,942
He's telling the truth, though,
when he says that the counterfeit's perfect.

480
00:30:37,018 --> 00:30:41,785
He truly- He does believe that.
But then again, he's just, uh-

481
00:30:41,856 --> 00:30:45,451
He's what's-his-name, uh,
down at the U.N. all over again, right?

482
00:30:45,527 --> 00:30:47,688
Uh, excuse me?

483
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:53,394
That guy, he truly did believe
all that W. M.D. nonsense.

484
00:30:53,468 --> 00:30:58,701
So, cleverly, they sent him off
down to the U.N. to sell it.

485
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,468
Rest is history.

486
00:31:00,542 --> 00:31:02,339
No one sent me here.

487
00:31:04,812 --> 00:31:09,044
The currency... is flawless.

488
00:31:10,251 --> 00:31:12,276
Nah. Uh-

489
00:31:12,353 --> 00:31:16,255
I mean, I'm sorry,
but it's not good enough.

490
00:31:16,324 --> 00:31:18,588
Who is this ass, huh?

491
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:21,220
Screw him. Let's go.

492
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,992
We're not done yet.

493
00:31:27,201 --> 00:31:30,364
- No! You swore to me that you wouldn't-
- Hey, hey!

494
00:31:30,438 --> 00:31:33,202
Is he telling the truth,
Dr. Lightman? Yes or no?

495
00:31:33,274 --> 00:31:36,175
Yes! Well, he believes that he is, yes.

496
00:31:36,244 --> 00:31:39,577
Good. So do we have a deal or not, huh?

497
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:45,213
Is this the best you got,
Professor Lightman?

498
00:31:45,286 --> 00:31:47,220
Because so far, I'm underwhelmed.

499
00:31:47,288 --> 00:31:48,949
Or is there more?

500
00:31:49,023 --> 00:31:51,856
Right. Well, you put me in front
of the actual counterfeiter...

501
00:31:51,926 --> 00:31:55,089
with the bank notes in his hands...

502
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:57,563
and I'll know
just how good his product is.

503
00:32:05,273 --> 00:32:09,710
Just you. Terry can stay here.

504
00:32:09,777 --> 00:32:11,904
No. Terry's with me.

505
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,675
It's not negotiable.

506
00:32:14,749 --> 00:32:17,047
- No. I'll be all right.
- Don't be daft.

507
00:32:17,118 --> 00:32:20,019
- You need to be thinking about yourself right now.
- Yeah, now you tell me.

508
00:32:20,088 --> 00:32:21,749
It's not negotiable.

509
00:32:30,298 --> 00:32:32,095
Come on!

510
00:32:35,336 --> 00:32:37,998
Say nothin', Terry. Not a word.

511
00:32:41,009 --> 00:32:44,240
This is him?
It's your counterfeiter, right?

512
00:32:44,312 --> 00:32:48,442
The best there is.
Fifty thousand Euros, right there.

513
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,420
Bloody hell.

514
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:59,489
- How many containers you got?
- That is not your concern.

515
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,994
Put it back.

516
00:33:03,331 --> 00:33:06,494
All right, um- What's your name?

517
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:09,127
- He doesn't need to know that.
- I've got to establish a baseline here-

518
00:33:09,203 --> 00:33:10,966
easy answers to easy questions.

519
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:14,270
- Then I can get to the bigger questions.
- Otto.

520
00:33:15,376 --> 00:33:19,073
- Hammil.
- Otto.

521
00:33:19,147 --> 00:33:20,808
What's your real last name?

522
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,017
- Frankel.
- Yeah.

523
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,948
- How many kids you got?
- None.

524
00:33:27,021 --> 00:33:28,682
- How long you been married?
- I'm not married.

525
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:30,485
- Where you from?
- Chicago.

526
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:33,026
Hey, get on with it, please, will you?

527
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:36,962
All right. Um, these notes
are counterfeit, right?

528
00:33:37,031 --> 00:33:40,159
- Yes.
- How good are they?

529
00:33:40,234 --> 00:33:44,068
We already tested a modest amount
without detection.

530
00:33:44,138 --> 00:33:47,801
- Well, Dr. Lightman?
- What?

531
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:51,207
Well, he hasn't answered my question yet.

532
00:33:53,414 --> 00:33:55,473
Easy, fellas. It's taken care of.

533
00:33:56,751 --> 00:33:59,845
He was right. F.B.I.

534
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:06,549
- Okay.
- I don't think I can do this.

535
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:09,528
I'll be right here
the whole time. Don't worry.

536
00:34:10,765 --> 00:34:12,699
Just take your time, Stacey.

537
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:23,438
You knew what they were
doing to me, Mr. Fitzgerald.

538
00:34:23,511 --> 00:34:26,912
You didn't just ignore it...

539
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,915
you started it all.

540
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:32,077
- Oh, Stacey-
- You kept telling me...

541
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:35,611
I was fat and lazy in front of them.

542
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:38,284
- The-That's not true.
- Your hands and eyes say otherwise.

543
00:34:38,359 --> 00:34:40,554
So do I.

544
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:44,221
I'm so sorry, Stacey.

545
00:34:44,298 --> 00:34:47,631
You know, I had a coach like you once...

546
00:34:47,702 --> 00:34:50,432
who had it in
for one of the kids on the team.

547
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:54,965
Constant verbal abuse
disguised as authority.

548
00:34:55,042 --> 00:35:00,036
Eddie, Eddie Johnston. And nothin' that
Eddie ever did was ever good enough.

549
00:35:00,114 --> 00:35:03,811
- You're out of line.
- And the example that that coach set for the rest of us...

550
00:35:03,885 --> 00:35:06,718
just like you did for Jasmine
and all of her buddies...

551
00:35:06,788 --> 00:35:11,657
we thought it gave us the license
to make Eddie an outcast.

552
00:35:11,726 --> 00:35:14,388
I never touched a hair on her head.

553
00:35:14,462 --> 00:35:17,989
Right. Because we did it for you.

554
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:23,626
I wanted you to have to live
the rest of your life-

555
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:28,300
knowing that what you did to me made me-

556
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:37,347
You knew what this
was really about all the time.

557
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:42,447
I know, because I sent you a video too.

558
00:35:42,523 --> 00:35:46,926
Which you, uh,
neglected to mention, Mr. Fitzgerald.

559
00:35:46,994 --> 00:35:48,825
Making you guilty
of obstruction of justice.

560
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:52,593
And if this keeps you
away from kids forever, I'll take it.

561
00:35:52,667 --> 00:35:54,601
Right, Stacey?

562
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:56,864
Yeah.

563
00:35:56,938 --> 00:36:00,635
Wait a minute. One kid has a-
has a psychological breakdown...

564
00:36:00,708 --> 00:36:03,677
an illness, and I'm to blame?

565
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,683
- Come on. We need to-
- I don't-

566
00:36:14,455 --> 00:36:16,389
Thank you.

567
00:36:18,192 --> 00:36:20,660
Well, there's a whitening
of the skin around the eyes...

568
00:36:20,728 --> 00:36:24,687
which is a dead giveaway for the kind
of fear that we try to hide when we lie.

569
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:28,223
And, uh, slight rotation of the right arm...

570
00:36:28,302 --> 00:36:31,203
which is what we call in the trade
a shrug fragment, which means...

571
00:36:31,272 --> 00:36:33,035
he's got zero confidence
in what he just said.

572
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:37,567
The eyes of a cheat...

573
00:36:37,645 --> 00:36:39,306
who thinks he has all the cards...

574
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:43,646
but who knows I'm telling the truth.

575
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,221
Well, he's Lying.

576
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,695
This son of a bitch has been
playin' us the whole time.

577
00:36:56,764 --> 00:36:58,425
Whoa. Easy. No, I didn't say-

578
00:36:58,499 --> 00:37:01,491
- You really think we're that dumb?
- Easy. No, I didn't say-

579
00:37:01,569 --> 00:37:03,264
No, no!

580
00:37:03,337 --> 00:37:05,669
F.B.I.! Nobody move!

581
00:37:07,775 --> 00:37:09,743
Anybody else?

582
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,835
Down on your knees! Now!

583
00:37:11,913 --> 00:37:14,040
Move! Move! Down!

584
00:37:14,115 --> 00:37:16,083
On your knees! Do it!

585
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,791
How'd you do that?

586
00:37:37,138 --> 00:37:39,299
- Blanks.
- Blanks?

587
00:37:39,373 --> 00:37:42,308
No, no, I mean with your eyes.
How do you do that?

588
00:37:42,376 --> 00:37:44,105
Oh, it was... just practice.

589
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,544
What's going on?

590
00:37:46,614 --> 00:37:49,378
- Get up.
- Oh, blimey.

591
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:51,077
Put your hands behind your back.

592
00:37:51,152 --> 00:37:53,985
I swear, I'm gettin'
too old for this, Terry. I really am.

593
00:37:54,055 --> 00:37:58,651
F.B.I. have been onto you
and McClellan for a while now.

594
00:37:58,726 --> 00:38:01,092
- Special Agent Hutton.
- Oh, nice to meet you.

595
00:38:01,162 --> 00:38:04,825
You too. Superior work, Agent Reynolds.

596
00:38:04,899 --> 00:38:07,561
Likewise, my friend.
So, how's that for having your back?

597
00:38:07,635 --> 00:38:09,933
Just like a real F.B.I. agent.

598
00:38:10,004 --> 00:38:12,165
- Thanks a lot, Cal.
- What?

599
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:15,265
So, uh- When'd you first
realize I was undercover, Dr. Lightman?

600
00:38:15,343 --> 00:38:17,334
Back at the poker table.

601
00:38:17,411 --> 00:38:21,871
You were angry and fearful,
but on my behalf.

602
00:38:24,785 --> 00:38:26,446
- Really?
- Yeah.

603
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,613
Come on. Let's go.

604
00:38:28,689 --> 00:38:31,920
Ben? Hold on a sec.

605
00:38:31,993 --> 00:38:34,985
I tell you what.
Terry walks for his part in this.

606
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:38,520
- What?
- And then we're evens.

607
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:41,193
You know I couldn't
have done this without him.

608
00:38:46,307 --> 00:38:49,242
He goes from here to the airport,
and he doesn't come back.

609
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:50,971
- Suits me.
- Ever.

610
00:38:51,045 --> 00:38:52,979
You know, you're one lucky son of a bitch.

611
00:38:53,047 --> 00:38:56,949
Hey. Hey, um- Can I borrow him
for a minute? Just personal stuff.

612
00:38:57,018 --> 00:38:58,883
Yeah. Just- Just make it-

613
00:38:58,953 --> 00:39:00,944
quick.

614
00:39:01,022 --> 00:39:03,855
I knew you were up to something
the moment you walked into my office!

615
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:07,382
Then I had to sit there and watch you play
me like one of those yuppies back in London!

616
00:39:07,461 --> 00:39:09,326
McClellan had me
by the short and curliest, Cal.

617
00:39:09,397 --> 00:39:12,161
- My best mate!
- Oh, come on! You think I wanted to do it?

618
00:39:12,233 --> 00:39:13,996
You were in on this from the start, Terry!

619
00:39:14,068 --> 00:39:17,401
They knew who I was before I even sat down
at that poker table.

620
00:39:17,471 --> 00:39:19,962
What was that?
That was just some little test run.

621
00:39:20,041 --> 00:39:21,736
- So what do you call this, eh?
- That?

622
00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:26,212
A couple of broken fingers
for a slice of that pie? Do me a favor.

623
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,874
And you can stop treating me
like a bloody moron now.

624
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:31,213
Yeah, well, maybe I just
came to resent you, Cal.

625
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:35,221
Hate me, more like. Eh?
Years will do that, Terry.

626
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:38,850
You saw all the way through it, didn't you?
You saw right through it from the start.

627
00:39:40,428 --> 00:39:44,091
Still helped me though,
didn't you? You know why?

628
00:39:44,165 --> 00:39:49,432
'Cause you always have been
and you always will be my best mate.

629
00:39:49,503 --> 00:39:53,030
Don't count on it, all right?

630
00:39:53,107 --> 00:39:55,166
I'll tell you what.

631
00:39:55,242 --> 00:39:59,178
My debt is now paid in full.

632
00:39:59,246 --> 00:40:02,340
No. Wait a sec. Wait a sec.
You owe me now.

633
00:40:02,416 --> 00:40:06,011
Yeah, I saved your bacon,
and I covered your ass with the F.B.I.

634
00:40:06,087 --> 00:40:07,884
I'm a very lucky man.

635
00:40:07,955 --> 00:40:09,889
Yeah.

636
00:40:12,226 --> 00:40:15,684
Well, all luck is earned, in the end.

637
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:19,530
Well, go on, then. Off you go.

638
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:33,442
Don't you dare look back!

639
00:40:50,798 --> 00:40:52,629
Hi.

640
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,635
- Have a seat.
- Why?

641
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:58,900
- This is an intervention.
- What?

642
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:03,976
All right. So I had a, you know,
few drinks with a mate.

643
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:08,242
- Yeah, well- More than a few, actually.
- This isn't about drinking.

644
00:41:08,315 --> 00:41:12,615
Well, then if it's about poker,
I won a hundred grand.

645
00:41:12,686 --> 00:41:16,053
- Hundred grand?
- Uh, hundred and five, actually.

646
00:41:16,123 --> 00:41:18,114
It's not about gambling either.

647
00:41:18,192 --> 00:41:20,183
- What is it about then?
- It's about you trusting us.

648
00:41:20,261 --> 00:41:23,128
You were in trouble,
and you never came to us.

649
00:41:23,197 --> 00:41:25,324
- Wait a minute.
- No, you wait.

650
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:28,664
We're a team, and you risked your life
without letting us help you.

651
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:33,173
Look, I wouldn't be here at all
if it wasn't for Terry Marsh.

652
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,140
Fine. So where does that leave us?

653
00:41:35,209 --> 00:41:39,942
- That leaves you all fired.
- You gotta be kidding.

654
00:41:40,014 --> 00:41:42,448
- I didn't even want to do this intervention thing.
- Just you then.

655
00:41:42,516 --> 00:41:44,848
Just you are fired- for having no spine.

656
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:48,150
- I don't believe this.
- Good. 'Cause I'm lying'.

657
00:41:48,222 --> 00:41:50,122
Oh, what? You didn't spot that?

658
00:41:50,191 --> 00:41:53,991
Oh, did your emotions get in the way?
You should really work on that.

659
00:41:54,061 --> 00:41:57,792
Well, this has been terrific.

660
00:41:57,865 --> 00:41:59,628
Really fantastic.

661
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:01,429
Quite the intervention.

662
00:42:01,502 --> 00:42:04,494
We should do this again soon, very soon.

663
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:11,541
The intervention was my idea.

664
00:42:22,923 --> 00:42:27,053
My mum died when I was young,
and my dad was long gone by then.

665
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:32,064
Terry and his family, they took me in, even
though there was no room, even less money.

666
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:36,091
And one day, um, Terry and I got into
a little bit of trouble with the police.

667
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:40,732
Not your concern.
But... they were on their way...

668
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:43,174
and there was no way
we could get out of it...

669
00:42:43,244 --> 00:42:46,042
without one of us
acting as a decoy for the other.

670
00:42:46,113 --> 00:42:48,911
- So Terry took the fall for you?
- Yeah, he did.

671
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:51,144
He said that, uh...

672
00:42:51,218 --> 00:42:53,209
"You're supposed to use
that brain of yours for something...

673
00:42:53,287 --> 00:42:56,552
not be dragged down into the muck
by stupid bastards like me. "

674
00:42:57,958 --> 00:43:00,017
- He was right.
- Yeah, he was.

675
00:43:01,362 --> 00:43:04,388
Yeah. Cost him three years of his life.

676
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:09,530
So anyone who wants to compete
for my loyalty with Terry Marsh...

677
00:43:10,537 --> 00:43:12,198
not really in a fair fight.

678
00:43:16,644 --> 00:43:18,305
Night, love.
