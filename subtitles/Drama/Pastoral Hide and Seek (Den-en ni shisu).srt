1
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,036
That's funny.

2
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,470
I could've sworn
I saw a little girl

3
00:01:57,568 --> 00:02:00,084
by the name
of Emily come in here.

4
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:01,745
Come out, come out,

5
00:02:01,848 --> 00:02:04,560
wherever you are...

6
00:02:04,659 --> 00:02:07,142
Could she be hiding
in the closet?

7
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,229
I wonder where she could be.

8
00:02:21,651 --> 00:02:24,776
Maybe my eyes
have deceived me.

9
00:02:24,877 --> 00:02:28,220
I'm invisible, Mommy.

10
00:02:28,327 --> 00:02:30,080
Well, if you're invisible...

11
00:02:31,553 --> 00:02:34,994
...then how could I... do this?!

12
00:02:38,356 --> 00:02:40,142
Did you know where I was?

13
00:02:40,241 --> 00:02:41,068
Not a clue.

14
00:02:42,988 --> 00:02:44,871
You want Alex?

15
00:02:53,752 --> 00:02:56,235
What is it?

16
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,654
I love you more
than anything else in the world.

17
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,544
You know that, don't you?

18
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,018
I love you, too.

19
00:03:14,258 --> 00:03:15,597
Good night, sweetheart.

20
00:03:17,228 --> 00:03:18,818
Make the face.

21
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:23,160
Please.

22
00:03:27,066 --> 00:03:29,810
- Now, go to sleep.
- Okay.

23
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,536
Mommy!

24
00:03:40,641 --> 00:03:42,394
Sorry.

25
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:47,309
Good night.

26
00:03:59,454 --> 00:04:01,523
You coming to bed?

27
00:04:01,626 --> 00:04:04,239
In a little while.

28
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,534
Something you want to talk about?

29
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:14,713
Some things are beyond therapy, David.

30
00:05:05,795 --> 00:05:07,614
Honey?

31
00:06:40,308 --> 00:06:42,443
I should've seen it coming.

32
00:06:42,543 --> 00:06:44,678
All the signs were there.

33
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,622
The ones closest to you
are the hardest to judge.

34
00:06:47,718 --> 00:06:48,731
No, but I...

35
00:06:48,836 --> 00:06:50,839
I could've prevented it.

36
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,436
David, it's not your fault.

37
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:56,495
How long have
we known each other?

38
00:06:56,598 --> 00:06:59,495
Trust me when I tell you this.

39
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,985
As difficult
as it may seem, you're...

40
00:07:02,092 --> 00:07:04,575
you're gonna have to try
and start over.

41
00:07:04,678 --> 00:07:07,608
We're gonna move.

42
00:07:07,713 --> 00:07:09,085
Upstate.

43
00:07:09,182 --> 00:07:10,293
The country.

44
00:07:13,431 --> 00:07:15,979
That's not exactly what
I meant by "starting over."

45
00:07:18,126 --> 00:07:19,585
What about Emily?

46
00:07:19,691 --> 00:07:22,021
This is a traumatic time for her.

47
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:24,667
I think it's important she stays
here and works through this.

48
00:07:24,769 --> 00:07:26,141
No, here, she's
flooded with memories.

49
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:29,081
I need to expose her
to a new environment,

50
00:07:29,178 --> 00:07:30,484
new things to do...

51
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,368
She'd be losing another person
she depends on.

52
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,167
It's only an hour away.

53
00:07:36,268 --> 00:07:39,611
And... you're always welcome
to come and see her.

54
00:07:39,718 --> 00:07:43,737
And right now, I need to do
what's right for Emily.

55
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,071
I need to be
a full-time dad.

56
00:07:53,836 --> 00:07:57,604
I have a surprise for you.

57
00:08:07,825 --> 00:08:11,648
When I was your age,
my mom gave me one just like that.

58
00:08:11,754 --> 00:08:14,880
And whenever I was feeling sad,

59
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:18,323
I would open the lid,
and all my sorrows went away.

60
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,150
Do you like it?

61
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:23,375
Give me a hug.

62
00:08:32,772 --> 00:08:34,492
You're going to like it there.

63
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,831
All right, let's go.

64
00:10:35,073 --> 00:10:36,477
Come on.

65
00:10:36,574 --> 00:10:38,294
Let's take a look.

66
00:10:45,517 --> 00:10:47,423
Right on time.

67
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,501
Dr. Callaway...

68
00:10:49,605 --> 00:10:51,097
Mr. Haskins.

69
00:10:51,203 --> 00:10:52,477
Hello.

70
00:10:52,576 --> 00:10:53,882
This is Sheriff Hafferty.

71
00:10:53,982 --> 00:10:54,995
Sheriff.

72
00:10:55,099 --> 00:10:56,657
He routinely checks
on the houses up here

73
00:10:56,761 --> 00:10:58,318
to make sure things
run smoothly.

74
00:10:58,422 --> 00:10:59,402
I see. Well, this is

75
00:10:59,507 --> 00:11:01,293
my daughter, Emily.
This is Sheriff Hafferty.

76
00:11:01,392 --> 00:11:02,568
Emily.

77
00:11:02,669 --> 00:11:05,120
How are you?

78
00:11:05,225 --> 00:11:07,010
This is Mr. Haskins.

79
00:11:07,109 --> 00:11:08,894
He found us the house.

80
00:11:08,994 --> 00:11:11,444
Well, hello there, Emily.

81
00:11:11,549 --> 00:11:14,859
Think your dad did a good job
picking the house?

82
00:11:17,075 --> 00:11:18,894
She's still deciding.

83
00:11:20,908 --> 00:11:22,693
Well, she sure is pretty.

84
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:23,935
Thank you.

85
00:11:24,038 --> 00:11:25,530
As I mentioned,

86
00:11:25,635 --> 00:11:26,942
Woodland Estates
is mainly

87
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,966
a summer community.

88
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:30,480
May be a little quiet
up here till then.

89
00:11:30,586 --> 00:11:32,045
Hope that's not a problem.

90
00:11:32,151 --> 00:11:33,904
- Not at all.
- Great.

91
00:11:34,003 --> 00:11:35,462
Let me show you
around the back.

92
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,712
You ever spent

93
00:11:36,814 --> 00:11:38,186
much time in the country?

94
00:11:38,283 --> 00:11:39,426
Not much.

95
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:41,348
I used to camp
when I was little,

96
00:11:41,445 --> 00:11:43,514
but I was always scared
of the woods.

97
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,154
Nothing to be scared of
in these woods.

98
00:11:47,259 --> 00:11:48,434
Picked a nice spot.

99
00:11:48,537 --> 00:11:50,192
Biggest house on the lake.

100
00:11:50,293 --> 00:11:53,386
Sheriff, if you'd like
to do the honors:

101
00:11:53,488 --> 00:11:56,036
let Dr. Callaway
into his new home.

102
00:11:56,138 --> 00:11:57,597
Figure out which key...

103
00:11:57,703 --> 00:12:00,796
Did you see where
my daughter went?

104
00:12:00,898 --> 00:12:02,270
Emily!

105
00:12:04,347 --> 00:12:06,285
Emily!

106
00:12:07,605 --> 00:12:09,358
Emily!

107
00:12:19,678 --> 00:12:21,747
Honey?

108
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,473
You okay?

109
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:28,360
Come on.
Let's go back.

110
00:12:28,462 --> 00:12:30,662
Come on.

111
00:12:30,763 --> 00:12:32,353
Come on.

112
00:12:37,406 --> 00:12:40,880
Mr. Haskins, Sheriff...
we'll take it from here.

113
00:12:55,037 --> 00:12:57,488
Spaghetti and meatballs
is your favorite dish.

114
00:12:57,593 --> 00:12:59,977
You're not hungry?

115
00:13:14,297 --> 00:13:16,181
I'd like to go to bed now.

116
00:13:23,497 --> 00:13:25,947
I'll come up
and kiss you good night.

117
00:13:37,966 --> 00:13:39,588
Oh, that's funny.

118
00:13:39,691 --> 00:13:41,825
I could have sworn
I saw a little girl

119
00:13:41,927 --> 00:13:44,442
by the name of Emily
come in here.

120
00:13:44,546 --> 00:13:46,713
I wonder...

121
00:13:46,814 --> 00:13:50,069
where she's hiding.

122
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:54,153
Could she be...
could she be...

123
00:13:54,255 --> 00:13:55,660
under the bed?!

124
00:13:55,756 --> 00:13:57,444
No.

125
00:13:57,546 --> 00:13:59,582
Could she be...

126
00:13:59,685 --> 00:14:02,549
hiding...

127
00:14:02,656 --> 00:14:06,805
Let's see, where
could she be hiding?

128
00:14:06,904 --> 00:14:09,387
Could she be
hiding in the... closet!

129
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:27,016
Okay...

130
00:14:27,122 --> 00:14:29,191
since it's the first night
in a new house,

131
00:14:29,294 --> 00:14:32,517
I thought it would be a good
time to start a new diary.

132
00:14:32,616 --> 00:14:33,988
Each day you
can write down

133
00:14:34,085 --> 00:14:35,577
your feelings
and thoughts,

134
00:14:35,683 --> 00:14:36,957
and then, one day,
you can look back

135
00:14:37,056 --> 00:14:38,330
and see
how much they've changed.

136
00:14:44,786 --> 00:14:47,301
I love you more than anything
else in the world, sweetheart.

137
00:14:47,405 --> 00:14:49,060
You know that.

138
00:14:49,161 --> 00:14:52,222
That's what Mommy said.

139
00:14:54,048 --> 00:14:57,751
Before she killed herself.

140
00:15:00,852 --> 00:15:02,791
Sweetheart,
she meant what she said.

141
00:15:02,896 --> 00:15:06,850
And so do I.

142
00:15:08,805 --> 00:15:09,948
You want me to put this

143
00:15:10,051 --> 00:15:11,870
over here?

144
00:15:11,967 --> 00:15:15,060
Okay.

145
00:15:15,162 --> 00:15:17,329
All right.

146
00:15:17,429 --> 00:15:19,085
Good night.

147
00:15:28,641 --> 00:15:31,287
Good night, Alex.

148
00:17:17,846 --> 00:17:21,701
Emily? Emily!

149
00:17:21,807 --> 00:17:23,560
Em?

150
00:17:32,283 --> 00:17:34,069
Emily?

151
00:17:34,168 --> 00:17:35,376
Oh, there you are.

152
00:17:35,478 --> 00:17:37,133
Come on, sweetheart.

153
00:17:37,234 --> 00:17:40,360
We're going into town.
We have some errands to do.

154
00:17:45,923 --> 00:17:47,349
Hello.

155
00:17:47,455 --> 00:17:48,827
Hi... Hi, there.

156
00:17:48,925 --> 00:17:51,189
l-I'm Laura.
I live next door.

157
00:17:51,288 --> 00:17:53,041
Oh, I'm David.
How are you?

158
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:55,340
Uh, here.
These are for you.

159
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,063
Oh, thank you very much.

160
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,550
My husband and I made
the preserves ourselves.

161
00:17:59,656 --> 00:18:01,377
Oh, well...

162
00:18:01,477 --> 00:18:04,156
I didn't even realize
anyone else lived up here.

163
00:18:04,256 --> 00:18:06,456
Well, it does get pretty quiet
in the off season.

164
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:09,776
Oh, this is my
daughter, Emily.

165
00:18:09,878 --> 00:18:12,295
Emily, say hello to Laura.

166
00:18:12,401 --> 00:18:13,413
She's our neighbor.

167
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:14,923
Isn't she adorable?

168
00:18:15,021 --> 00:18:17,122
You going to say hi?

169
00:18:19,588 --> 00:18:20,763
Well, she gets a little shy

170
00:18:20,866 --> 00:18:21,878
around new faces.

171
00:18:21,983 --> 00:18:23,257
I understand.

172
00:18:23,356 --> 00:18:26,351
It's going to be a real treat
having both of you here.

173
00:18:29,649 --> 00:18:31,620
Oh, you're on your way out.

174
00:18:31,725 --> 00:18:33,064
I won't keep you.

175
00:18:33,163 --> 00:18:35,493
Um, if you need anything,
don't hesitate to stop by.

176
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:36,571
Same here.

177
00:18:36,676 --> 00:18:38,266
And thank you
for all the preserves.

178
00:18:38,369 --> 00:18:39,959
The peach and apricot preserves.

179
00:18:40,062 --> 00:18:41,401
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

180
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,601
I'm gonna put this inside.

181
00:18:52,614 --> 00:18:54,367
Amy, don't swing so high.

182
00:18:57,341 --> 00:18:59,574
I'm going
to tell your mom.

183
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:16,019
Would you listen to me?

184
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,548
Hi.

185
00:19:31,646 --> 00:19:33,715
Hi.

186
00:19:33,818 --> 00:19:36,911
I have, uh,
a daughter the same age.

187
00:19:38,226 --> 00:19:39,500
She's in the car.

188
00:19:42,186 --> 00:19:44,190
I'm Elizabeth.

189
00:19:44,294 --> 00:19:46,711
Elizabeth Young.

190
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:49,148
Hi.
David Callaway.

191
00:19:49,245 --> 00:19:50,258
- How are you?
- Good.

192
00:19:50,363 --> 00:19:51,605
Nice to meet you.

193
00:19:51,705 --> 00:19:53,044
Are you visiting?

194
00:19:53,142 --> 00:19:55,505
Just moved up
from the city.

195
00:19:55,602 --> 00:19:57,028
Oh, usually it's
the other way around.

196
00:19:57,135 --> 00:19:58,790
I know.

197
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:02,564
She your kid?

198
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,250
Oh, no. No.

199
00:20:04,354 --> 00:20:05,911
She's my sister's kid.

200
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,735
I'm the honorary baby-sitter.

201
00:20:07,835 --> 00:20:09,262
Watch.

202
00:20:09,368 --> 00:20:11,121
Amy, be careful.

203
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,191
Amy...

204
00:20:16,587 --> 00:20:18,471
- Amy.
- She all right?

205
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:21,018
Amy, Jesus,
are you all right?

206
00:20:23,486 --> 00:20:25,489
That's very funny.

207
00:20:25,594 --> 00:20:27,118
Oh, my God, you're
going to make me nuts,

208
00:20:27,223 --> 00:20:28,203
you know that?

209
00:20:30,513 --> 00:20:32,037
Is your daughter
this crazy?

210
00:20:40,191 --> 00:20:41,367
Where's Alex?

211
00:20:41,469 --> 00:20:43,832
I don't like her anymore.

212
00:20:45,525 --> 00:20:47,725
Did I just hear
what I think I heard?

213
00:20:47,825 --> 00:20:49,415
Are you mad, Daddy?

214
00:20:49,518 --> 00:20:51,108
No, I'm not mad at all, honey.

215
00:20:51,211 --> 00:20:52,137
I think it's great.

216
00:20:52,233 --> 00:20:53,158
You do?

217
00:20:53,255 --> 00:20:54,529
Yeah.

218
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:56,480
Good.

219
00:20:56,577 --> 00:20:59,354
Because I have a new friend.

220
00:20:59,451 --> 00:21:02,413
A new friend? Okay.

221
00:21:02,517 --> 00:21:05,163
Let me guess.
Is it, um...

222
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:06,375
Veronica?

223
00:21:06,479 --> 00:21:08,166
No.

224
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,434
Uh, is it, uh, Patty?

225
00:21:12,515 --> 00:21:13,310
Is it...

226
00:21:13,409 --> 00:21:14,487
He's not a doll.

227
00:21:16,348 --> 00:21:17,328
He's...

228
00:21:17,434 --> 00:21:19,797
Not a doll.

229
00:21:19,894 --> 00:21:21,233
He.

230
00:21:21,331 --> 00:21:23,465
Okay, well,

231
00:21:23,567 --> 00:21:26,050
if he's not a doll,
then who is he?

232
00:21:26,154 --> 00:21:27,842
He doesn't want me
to talk about him.

233
00:21:27,942 --> 00:21:29,053
Doesn't want you
to talk about him?

234
00:21:29,156 --> 00:21:30,430
No.

235
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,705
Well, what if I promise

236
00:21:31,808 --> 00:21:33,332
to keep it a secret,
could you tell me then?

237
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:40,396
So, what's his name?

238
00:21:40,495 --> 00:21:42,792
He told me to call him Charlie.

239
00:21:42,891 --> 00:21:45,569
Charlie? Oh, that's
an interesting name.

240
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,325
Charlie.

241
00:21:47,427 --> 00:21:49,245
When did you meet Charlie?

242
00:21:49,343 --> 00:21:50,290
Today.

243
00:21:50,397 --> 00:21:52,248
When we went to town?

244
00:21:52,345 --> 00:21:54,512
It was before that.

245
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:57,063
Before that. Huh.

246
00:21:57,169 --> 00:22:01,667
Is he... here right now?

247
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,154
I think he's sleeping.

248
00:22:09,146 --> 00:22:10,420
Okay.

249
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,458
Well, in that case,

250
00:22:12,563 --> 00:22:14,796
we better not wake him, hmm?

251
00:22:14,895 --> 00:22:16,997
It's not unusual

252
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,583
for a traumatized child
to create imaginary friends.

253
00:22:19,686 --> 00:22:22,267
I know, I just wish
she'd confide in me

254
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:23,861
instead of using fantasy.

255
00:22:23,966 --> 00:22:25,241
Trauma causes pain.

256
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,150
Eventually the mind
will find a way to release it.

257
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:29,422
No kidding.

258
00:22:29,524 --> 00:22:31,376
Don't forget: I'm the one
who taught you that stuff.

259
00:22:31,473 --> 00:22:33,444
As a matter of fact, you did, yes.

260
00:22:33,549 --> 00:22:35,552
Just have fun with her, David.

261
00:22:35,658 --> 00:22:36,899
Play with her.

262
00:22:36,999 --> 00:22:38,970
That's what she needs.

263
00:23:14,241 --> 00:23:16,986
These are beginner rods.

264
00:23:21,811 --> 00:23:24,740
Let's see... two rods,

265
00:23:24,846 --> 00:23:27,296
$41.50 each...

266
00:23:40,017 --> 00:23:41,640
Plus bait and tackle...

267
00:23:46,278 --> 00:23:47,704
Sheriff.

268
00:23:51,772 --> 00:23:54,865
You parked in a handicap zone.

269
00:23:57,074 --> 00:23:58,282
Oh, I didn't even realize.

270
00:23:58,384 --> 00:24:00,289
Could you give me a break?
I didn't realize.

271
00:24:02,216 --> 00:24:04,100
Enjoy your day.

272
00:24:10,905 --> 00:24:12,146
Eh, so much for

273
00:24:12,246 --> 00:24:13,585
small town
hospitality, honey.

274
00:24:13,684 --> 00:24:15,208
- Shut the door.
- We broke the law.

275
00:24:15,313 --> 00:24:17,164
I know we broke the law.

276
00:24:17,261 --> 00:24:18,502
Shut the door.

277
00:24:23,106 --> 00:24:24,990
The Loch Ness Monster.

278
00:24:25,086 --> 00:24:26,197
What?

279
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,640
You know what that is?

280
00:24:27,737 --> 00:24:29,937
It's in Scotland.

281
00:24:32,368 --> 00:24:34,405
This is a good spot, huh?

282
00:24:58,336 --> 00:25:00,372
Honey, what are you doing?

283
00:25:03,767 --> 00:25:05,967
You think that's a good idea?

284
00:25:09,069 --> 00:25:12,924
Emily, we have bait.

285
00:25:16,447 --> 00:25:18,515
See?

286
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:21,777
All right.

287
00:25:25,582 --> 00:25:27,237
Did you have
a nice time today?

288
00:25:27,339 --> 00:25:28,710
It was okay.

289
00:25:28,808 --> 00:25:30,714
Just okay?

290
00:25:32,545 --> 00:25:35,158
Well, then, what could we
have done to make it better?

291
00:25:38,646 --> 00:25:40,137
What if Charlie was there?

292
00:25:40,243 --> 00:25:41,964
Would he have made it better?

293
00:25:42,063 --> 00:25:45,352
He's a lot of fun.

294
00:25:45,449 --> 00:25:46,691
Fun like how?

295
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:52,119
Fun like Mommy.

296
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:01,411
It's a little stuffy in here.

297
00:26:19,275 --> 00:26:20,701
It's stuck.

298
00:26:22,181 --> 00:26:24,000
It's okay, Daddy.

299
00:26:24,098 --> 00:26:26,428
It just...

300
00:26:38,184 --> 00:26:41,342
...three, two, one...

301
00:26:41,441 --> 00:26:44,055
Happy New Year!

302
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:04,509
Emily, why would you do this?

303
00:28:04,615 --> 00:28:06,139
I didn't do it.

304
00:28:06,245 --> 00:28:07,769
What do you mean,
you didn't do it?

305
00:28:07,873 --> 00:28:09,081
There's nobody here but us.

306
00:28:09,183 --> 00:28:10,773
It wasn't me.

307
00:28:12,568 --> 00:28:14,986
This is your writing,
and these are your crayons, honey.

308
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,343
It's all right. Just tell me.

309
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:19,524
You don't have to lie to me.

310
00:28:19,627 --> 00:28:20,967
I'm not lying.

311
00:28:21,065 --> 00:28:22,971
Okay, well,
if you didn't do it,

312
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:24,667
then who did?

313
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:28,471
It was Charlie.

314
00:28:33,075 --> 00:28:34,672
She thinks I'm responsible

315
00:28:34,672 --> 00:28:35,847
She thinks I'm responsible

316
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,158
for Alison's death.

317
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:40,320
It's Charlie
that holds you responsible.

318
00:28:40,421 --> 00:28:41,629
Use him, David.

319
00:28:41,731 --> 00:28:43,516
Use him to get through to her.

320
00:28:43,615 --> 00:28:45,206
He's the key.

321
00:28:45,308 --> 00:28:47,889
l-I have to go, I...

322
00:28:47,991 --> 00:28:49,995
I think I found her
a real friend.

323
00:28:50,099 --> 00:28:51,438
Really? That's great.

324
00:28:51,536 --> 00:28:52,646
Call me if you need me, okay?

325
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,274
- Bye.
- Okay, bye.

326
00:28:56,168 --> 00:28:58,204
Hi.

327
00:28:58,308 --> 00:28:59,233
- Hi.
- Hi.

328
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:00,277
Hi, Amy.

329
00:29:02,429 --> 00:29:03,953
Glad you came.

330
00:29:04,057 --> 00:29:07,117
Em... we have guests.

331
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,039
Emily?

332
00:29:14,981 --> 00:29:16,539
This is Elizabeth.

333
00:29:16,642 --> 00:29:17,622
Hi, Emily.

334
00:29:17,728 --> 00:29:18,969
Emily, this is Amy.

335
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,790
Hi.

336
00:29:22,423 --> 00:29:24,524
Hi.

337
00:29:24,627 --> 00:29:27,077
Coffee-maker
has a mind of its own.

338
00:29:27,183 --> 00:29:28,674
Oh, God...

339
00:29:34,337 --> 00:29:37,016
Thank you.

340
00:29:39,416 --> 00:29:41,267
So, is that your wife?

341
00:29:45,644 --> 00:29:47,136
She passed away.

342
00:29:50,052 --> 00:29:51,642
I'm sorry.

343
00:29:51,745 --> 00:29:55,699
No matter how many times I say it,
it still sounds so strange.

344
00:29:55,801 --> 00:29:57,554
Must be hard on Emily.

345
00:29:57,653 --> 00:30:00,267
Have you ever been married?

346
00:30:00,369 --> 00:30:01,927
Actually, I just got divorced.

347
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,815
I'm living with my sister

348
00:30:03,914 --> 00:30:07,224
and her husband till I can
figure out my next move.

349
00:30:09,185 --> 00:30:12,756
Best way to get over the past
is to start something new.

350
00:30:12,858 --> 00:30:15,787
That's why we're here.

351
00:30:17,457 --> 00:30:19,210
...baby, wrap it up

352
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,801
in toilet paper,
put it in the incubator.

353
00:30:20,906 --> 00:30:22,845
What shall it be?

354
00:30:22,951 --> 00:30:25,815
Oh! By the way,
this is Penelope.

355
00:30:25,921 --> 00:30:27,479
Thanks.

356
00:30:27,582 --> 00:30:29,880
You're gonna like it here.

357
00:30:29,978 --> 00:30:32,146
It's a lot of fun.

358
00:30:32,246 --> 00:30:34,478
Well, it's not always fun,

359
00:30:34,577 --> 00:30:37,887
but there are lots
of fun things to do.

360
00:30:41,444 --> 00:30:43,862
She's beautiful.

361
00:30:45,246 --> 00:30:46,705
What's her name?

362
00:30:50,804 --> 00:30:53,101
Well, you don't talk much,
do you?

363
00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:56,357
You shouldn't be here.

364
00:30:56,457 --> 00:30:57,731
Why not?

365
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,615
You could get hurt.

366
00:31:09,042 --> 00:31:10,893
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

367
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:14,431
So, um... so,
you have my number.

368
00:31:14,535 --> 00:31:16,158
I'll talk to you soon.

369
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,241
Okay...

370
00:31:17,346 --> 00:31:19,317
I guess I should go.

371
00:31:19,422 --> 00:31:20,696
- Yeah.
- Okay.

372
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:21,971
- Bye.
- Bye.

373
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,365
Bye, Emily.

374
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:39,760
So... what'd you
think of Amy?

375
00:31:39,865 --> 00:31:42,543
Did you like her?

376
00:31:42,644 --> 00:31:45,540
I don't need any more friends.

377
00:32:34,611 --> 00:32:35,885
Good, good.

378
00:32:35,984 --> 00:32:36,997
There.

379
00:32:37,102 --> 00:32:38,245
Perfect.

380
00:32:38,348 --> 00:32:39,458
Hi.

381
00:32:39,562 --> 00:32:40,966
Hey. Sorry.

382
00:32:41,063 --> 00:32:42,718
I didn't mean to intrude.

383
00:32:43,937 --> 00:32:44,950
I'm Steven.

384
00:32:45,055 --> 00:32:46,166
Laura's husband from next door.

385
00:32:46,269 --> 00:32:47,282
Oh, yeah. Hi.

386
00:32:47,387 --> 00:32:48,759
It's David, right?

387
00:32:48,857 --> 00:32:50,414
Yes, it's David.

388
00:32:50,518 --> 00:32:52,423
Just wanted to say hi.

389
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:54,664
Nice to...
nice to meet you, Steven.

390
00:32:54,766 --> 00:32:55,974
Figured, you know...

391
00:32:56,075 --> 00:32:58,144
gonna be neighbors,
you might as well be neighborly, right?

392
00:32:58,247 --> 00:32:59,935
Right.

393
00:33:00,036 --> 00:33:02,878
Uh... well, you're gonna have
to excuse us, Steven.

394
00:33:02,974 --> 00:33:03,921
We have a busy day

395
00:33:04,028 --> 00:33:06,674
ahead of us.
Honey, come on.

396
00:33:08,053 --> 00:33:09,872
Emily...

397
00:33:09,969 --> 00:33:12,202
let's go.

398
00:33:14,442 --> 00:33:16,826
Bye.

399
00:33:19,743 --> 00:33:21,147
Listen, you need anything,

400
00:33:21,245 --> 00:33:22,769
just give a shout, will you?

401
00:33:22,873 --> 00:33:25,650
Okay. Thank you.
See you around.

402
00:33:25,748 --> 00:33:26,826
David?

403
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:28,106
Yeah?

404
00:33:30,795 --> 00:33:33,789
You're very lucky to have
such a beautiful daughter.

405
00:33:33,893 --> 00:33:36,703
Thank you.

406
00:33:47,468 --> 00:33:49,091
You remember
what I told you

407
00:33:49,192 --> 00:33:50,978
about not talking
to strangers?

408
00:33:51,077 --> 00:33:52,319
He's not a stranger.

409
00:33:52,418 --> 00:33:53,365
What do you mean?

410
00:33:53,473 --> 00:33:54,649
He's our neighbor.

411
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,917
As far as I'm concerned,
he's a stranger, honey.

412
00:33:57,018 --> 00:33:58,902
Don't walk away
when I'm talking to you.

413
00:33:58,998 --> 00:34:00,109
I'm telling you something.

414
00:34:00,212 --> 00:34:02,183
I'm sorry, Daddy.
Weren't you finished?

415
00:34:02,289 --> 00:34:03,269
No, I wasn't finished.

416
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,159
What I'm saying is,
it's very important

417
00:34:05,259 --> 00:34:07,165
for you to listen
when I tell you something.

418
00:34:07,271 --> 00:34:08,251
Okay.

419
00:34:08,357 --> 00:34:09,816
Okay?

420
00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:50,644
What are you doing,
sweetheart?

421
00:34:50,743 --> 00:34:51,755
Nothing.

422
00:34:51,861 --> 00:34:53,069
What's so funny?

423
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:55,784
Is Charlie here?

424
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,224
He just left.

425
00:34:57,323 --> 00:34:58,814
Where'd he go?

426
00:35:06,681 --> 00:35:08,271
Did you open that?

427
00:35:08,374 --> 00:35:10,279
I thought you did.

428
00:35:43,605 --> 00:35:45,456
I want to talk to Charlie.

429
00:35:45,553 --> 00:35:47,077
What would you like
to talk about?

430
00:35:47,182 --> 00:35:49,698
I'd like to talk to him
about all sorts of things.

431
00:35:49,801 --> 00:35:50,781
Like what?

432
00:35:50,887 --> 00:35:54,938
Like, uh... well,
what makes him happy...

433
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:58,197
what makes him sad...

434
00:35:58,298 --> 00:35:59,311
So, what do you say?

435
00:35:59,415 --> 00:36:02,028
You think you can introduce us?

436
00:36:02,131 --> 00:36:04,232
I don't think that's going to work.

437
00:36:04,334 --> 00:36:05,315
Why's that?

438
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:08,098
He doesn't like you very much.

439
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:11,455
Oh, why doesn't he
like me very much?

440
00:36:11,553 --> 00:36:14,896
Does it have something
to do with Mommy?

441
00:36:15,002 --> 00:36:16,973
Honey?

442
00:36:18,995 --> 00:36:21,924
What does he tell you?

443
00:36:39,022 --> 00:36:41,254
...three, one thousand,

444
00:36:41,354 --> 00:36:42,562
four, one thousand,

445
00:36:42,663 --> 00:36:44,667
five, one thousand,

446
00:36:44,771 --> 00:36:46,198
six, one thousand,

447
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:47,579
seven, one thousand,

448
00:36:47,677 --> 00:36:49,201
eight, one thousand,

449
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:50,766
nine, one thousand,

450
00:36:50,872 --> 00:36:52,276
ten, one thousand.

451
00:36:52,373 --> 00:36:56,838
Ready or not, here I come.

452
00:37:18,629 --> 00:37:21,657
Charlie...

453
00:37:23,036 --> 00:37:25,682
Charlie...

454
00:37:50,442 --> 00:37:53,186
Charlie...

455
00:37:56,542 --> 00:38:00,496
Come out, come out
wherever you are.

456
00:39:07,866 --> 00:39:09,935
Charlie?

457
00:39:10,038 --> 00:39:12,107
Is that you?

458
00:39:18,214 --> 00:39:19,772
Emily!

459
00:39:21,313 --> 00:39:22,456
Emily!

460
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,312
Emily!

461
00:39:35,527 --> 00:39:36,801
Where are you?

462
00:39:39,648 --> 00:39:40,628
What happened?

463
00:39:40,733 --> 00:39:41,778
Why are you down here?

464
00:39:41,883 --> 00:39:44,660
Emily, talk to me.

465
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,609
He was hiding.

466
00:39:46,706 --> 00:39:47,566
Who was hiding?

467
00:39:47,665 --> 00:39:48,939
In the dark.

468
00:39:56,991 --> 00:39:59,953
Can I go to bed now?

469
00:40:17,273 --> 00:40:18,612
Hi.

470
00:40:18,711 --> 00:40:20,682
Hi.

471
00:40:20,787 --> 00:40:22,606
Do you have a minute?

472
00:40:22,704 --> 00:40:25,993
Yeah. Oh, sure.
Come on in.

473
00:40:26,089 --> 00:40:28,638
Thank you. Thank you.

474
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:34,487
I wanted to apologize

475
00:40:34,585 --> 00:40:35,663
for my husband.

476
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:37,673
He said he had a...
awkward moment

477
00:40:37,779 --> 00:40:39,402
yesterday
with you and Emily.

478
00:40:39,504 --> 00:40:40,713
That's all right.
Don't worry about it.

479
00:40:40,814 --> 00:40:42,752
He's harmless, really.
He wouldn't hurt a fly.

480
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:44,829
That's fine.

481
00:40:44,934 --> 00:40:46,905
It's just that...

482
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:50,615
we lost a child recently-
a girl...

483
00:40:50,715 --> 00:40:55,278
and in some ways,
Emily reminds us of her.

484
00:40:55,379 --> 00:40:58,537
I see.

485
00:40:58,636 --> 00:41:01,631
He was just... reaching out. Hmm?

486
00:41:05,535 --> 00:41:09,271
There is nothing worse
in this world than losing a child.

487
00:41:51,495 --> 00:41:52,899
Here, taste this.

488
00:41:52,996 --> 00:41:54,902
I think it may be too salty.

489
00:41:55,008 --> 00:41:56,021
Oh. Okay.

490
00:41:58,649 --> 00:41:59,630
- Not bad.
- Really?

491
00:41:59,735 --> 00:42:01,706
- Not bad.
- Oh, good.

492
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:03,531
Really good.

493
00:42:05,324 --> 00:42:08,319
Wow! You look so pretty.

494
00:42:08,423 --> 00:42:11,417
You didn't have to get
all dressed up for me.

495
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:14,232
Honey, would you go upstairs

496
00:42:14,332 --> 00:42:16,085
and change
into something else, please?

497
00:42:16,185 --> 00:42:18,417
Don't you like it?

498
00:42:18,516 --> 00:42:21,162
Not for dinner, no.

499
00:42:21,263 --> 00:42:22,438
Why not?

500
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:24,196
You know why.

501
00:42:24,297 --> 00:42:26,781
She looks so pretty.
Let's just eat.

502
00:42:26,885 --> 00:42:30,195
I think you look
really beautiful.

503
00:42:42,535 --> 00:42:45,377
Did Daddy tell you
that my mommy died?

504
00:42:48,444 --> 00:42:50,513
Yes, he did.

505
00:42:50,617 --> 00:42:51,662
And I'm very sorry.

506
00:42:51,766 --> 00:42:53,258
Did he tell you
how she died?

507
00:42:53,364 --> 00:42:56,489
Honey, I don't think Elizabeth
really wants to hear

508
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:57,733
how that happened,
okay?

509
00:42:57,835 --> 00:42:58,881
She killed herself
in our bathtub.

510
00:42:58,985 --> 00:43:00,389
- Emily...
- Slit her wrists with a razor.

511
00:43:00,487 --> 00:43:02,458
Emily.

512
00:43:02,562 --> 00:43:05,404
That's enough.

513
00:43:10,261 --> 00:43:12,297
Emily, I brought you something.

514
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,817
Your dad asked me to bring over

515
00:43:14,923 --> 00:43:16,295
some of Amy's books.

516
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:18,299
These were some
of my favorites

517
00:43:18,405 --> 00:43:20,289
when I was your age.

518
00:43:20,386 --> 00:43:22,292
Oh, that's great.

519
00:43:22,398 --> 00:43:24,979
Give you a chance to see
what the other kids are reading

520
00:43:25,081 --> 00:43:26,028
before you get started.

521
00:43:26,135 --> 00:43:28,552
You gonna say thanks?

522
00:43:31,533 --> 00:43:33,733
Emily...

523
00:43:36,324 --> 00:43:39,101
Emily... Emily, stop it.
That's enough.

524
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:40,538
Do you like her, Daddy?

525
00:43:40,636 --> 00:43:42,094
- Stop this.
- Charlie says you do.

526
00:43:42,201 --> 00:43:44,020
- Go to your room.
- He says you like her

527
00:43:44,117 --> 00:43:45,641
- As much as Mommy.
- Go to your room. To your room.

528
00:43:45,746 --> 00:43:47,914
If you're going to behave
this way, go to your room.

529
00:43:49,292 --> 00:43:51,427
Let's hope you don't
wind up like her.

530
00:44:03,123 --> 00:44:04,908
I'm sorry.

531
00:44:05,007 --> 00:44:05,899
Who's Charlie?

532
00:44:05,997 --> 00:44:08,513
Oh, he's her imaginary friend.

533
00:44:08,617 --> 00:44:10,272
Her only friend.

534
00:44:15,004 --> 00:44:19,665
I always wanted her to have
a better childhood than I had.

535
00:44:19,764 --> 00:44:21,419
Now look.

536
00:44:26,439 --> 00:44:28,258
Drive safely.

537
00:44:54,739 --> 00:44:56,840
Attention, please!

538
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:03,771
Maybe after
a few more martinis...

539
00:46:19,382 --> 00:46:21,201
Charlie did it.

540
00:46:22,257 --> 00:46:24,163
You do believe me,
don't you, Daddy?

541
00:46:24,269 --> 00:46:26,566
Why are you looking at me
like that?

542
00:46:46,021 --> 00:46:47,034
Mr. Callaway.

543
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:48,662
I didn't mean to disturb you.

544
00:46:50,492 --> 00:46:52,790
Thought you might
be needing these.

545
00:47:00,841 --> 00:47:02,365
Those are the keys
for the, uh,

546
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:04,441
different rooms in the house.

547
00:47:04,546 --> 00:47:06,930
I forgot to give them
to you earlier.

548
00:47:07,038 --> 00:47:08,595
I apologize.

549
00:47:10,583 --> 00:47:13,099
It's a little late to be
delivering keys, isn't it?

550
00:47:13,202 --> 00:47:15,848
Well, I thought I could slip
them under the door.

551
00:47:15,949 --> 00:47:18,333
Wife and I are going

552
00:47:18,441 --> 00:47:20,640
to Canada first thing
in the morning.

553
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:23,702
We've got a little cabin
tucked away in the woods.

554
00:47:23,806 --> 00:47:26,997
Good place to clear the mind.

555
00:47:29,428 --> 00:47:30,986
Everything all right?

556
00:47:35,497 --> 00:47:37,827
Well, enjoy.

557
00:48:24,621 --> 00:48:27,463
What's for breakfast?

558
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:42,692
Honey, why would Charlie
do such a horrible thing?

559
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:48,699
Is it because of Elizabeth?

560
00:48:52,058 --> 00:48:54,258
Charlie needs to understand
something, honey.

561
00:48:54,359 --> 00:48:57,071
Elizabeth is not trying
to take Mommy's place.

562
00:48:57,169 --> 00:48:58,661
Does he understand that?

563
00:49:01,226 --> 00:49:02,173
Honey, I can't help you

564
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,131
if you don't talk to me.

565
00:49:07,103 --> 00:49:09,368
Why doesn't he like Elizabeth?

566
00:49:09,466 --> 00:49:11,372
Because she likes you.

567
00:49:11,478 --> 00:49:12,818
And?

568
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:15,758
He doesn't want you to be happy.

569
00:49:18,857 --> 00:49:20,926
Honey...

570
00:49:21,029 --> 00:49:23,359
you know this has nothing
to do with Charlie.

571
00:49:23,457 --> 00:49:24,731
You do know that.

572
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:28,173
It's about you, honey.

573
00:49:28,279 --> 00:49:29,837
And that's okay.

574
00:49:31,889 --> 00:49:33,642
Charlie doesn't exist.

575
00:49:33,742 --> 00:49:36,159
You shouldn't say that.

576
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:37,278
Why not?

577
00:49:39,747 --> 00:49:41,337
You're going to make him mad.

578
00:49:41,439 --> 00:49:43,736
Oh, well, so what?

579
00:49:43,835 --> 00:49:45,077
I'll get him mad.

580
00:49:45,176 --> 00:49:47,212
Let him come out
and yell at me. Good.

581
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:49,168
I want to see him.
Where is he?

582
00:49:49,265 --> 00:49:51,715
You want to see him?

583
00:50:09,963 --> 00:50:12,957
Who's that supposed to be?

584
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:15,228
Charlie and Mommy.

585
00:50:15,328 --> 00:50:16,700
She would have liked him.

586
00:50:16,798 --> 00:50:18,965
No, trust me, honey.

587
00:50:19,065 --> 00:50:21,428
Mommy wouldn't like Charlie.

588
00:50:21,525 --> 00:50:24,867
That's not what he says.

589
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:29,696
What do you mean?

590
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,257
What do you mean?
What does he say?

591
00:50:35,355 --> 00:50:37,968
What does he say?

592
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:39,344
What does Charlie say?

593
00:50:39,444 --> 00:50:41,196
Talk to me.
What does he say?

594
00:50:41,296 --> 00:50:43,680
He says he would
have satisfied her.

595
00:50:46,662 --> 00:50:47,740
Who told you to say that?

596
00:50:47,845 --> 00:50:49,184
Charlie did.

597
00:50:49,281 --> 00:50:51,252
No, who...
who told you that?

598
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:52,217
Charlie did.

599
00:50:52,316 --> 00:50:53,971
There is no Charlie.
Who said it?

600
00:50:54,073 --> 00:50:55,019
Charlie did!

601
00:50:55,127 --> 00:50:56,052
He did not. Who said it?

602
00:50:56,149 --> 00:50:58,533
Charlie! Charlie!

603
00:50:58,641 --> 00:51:01,025
Charlie! Charlie!

604
00:51:01,131 --> 00:51:02,112
Charlie! Charlie!

605
00:51:02,218 --> 00:51:04,962
Charlie! Charlie!

606
00:51:14,611 --> 00:51:15,786
Hey, sweetheart.

607
00:51:15,889 --> 00:51:17,064
I'm so happy you came.

608
00:51:17,166 --> 00:51:19,202
It's so good to see you.

609
00:51:21,701 --> 00:51:23,454
Want to show me the house?

610
00:51:23,554 --> 00:51:24,501
Yeah.

611
00:51:24,608 --> 00:51:26,329
Okay.

612
00:51:26,429 --> 00:51:28,248
Hey, David.
How are you?

613
00:51:28,346 --> 00:51:29,423
Good.
Good to see you.

614
00:51:29,527 --> 00:51:30,670
Good to see you, too.

615
00:51:30,772 --> 00:51:32,972
Glad you could come.

616
00:51:35,468 --> 00:51:37,123
Do you like it here?

617
00:51:37,224 --> 00:51:38,879
I'm having a lot of fun.

618
00:51:38,982 --> 00:51:42,107
You are?

619
00:51:42,208 --> 00:51:45,998
Tell me about
your friend Charlie.

620
00:51:46,104 --> 00:51:48,848
He doesn't like me
to talk about him.

621
00:51:48,947 --> 00:51:51,398
I'm sure he wouldn't mind
if you told me.

622
00:51:54,345 --> 00:51:56,675
Tell me, what do you
guys do together?

623
00:51:56,773 --> 00:51:58,199
Play games.

624
00:51:58,305 --> 00:51:59,797
What kind of games?

625
00:51:59,903 --> 00:52:02,038
Hide and seek.

626
00:52:02,138 --> 00:52:03,793
That's our favorite.

627
00:52:03,896 --> 00:52:07,370
Sounds like Charlie's
a lot of fun.

628
00:52:12,583 --> 00:52:14,042
So what do you guys talk about?

629
00:52:14,148 --> 00:52:15,074
I don't know.

630
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:16,728
Bunch of things.

631
00:52:16,831 --> 00:52:20,054
Sometimes he even
talks about you.

632
00:52:23,187 --> 00:52:24,810
Really.

633
00:52:24,912 --> 00:52:26,470
And what does he say?

634
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:31,523
You can tell me.

635
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:34,778
He's afraid you're
going to get in the way.

636
00:52:34,878 --> 00:52:37,622
In the...
In the way of what?

637
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:39,985
Our game.

638
00:52:40,084 --> 00:52:42,284
What game is that?

639
00:52:42,383 --> 00:52:45,160
Upsetting Daddy.

640
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,768
Isn't she pretty?

641
00:52:53,882 --> 00:52:56,398
David, I'd like
to bring Emily back with me.

642
00:52:56,502 --> 00:52:58,832
At least for a little while,
so she can be evaluated.

643
00:52:58,929 --> 00:53:02,882
I'm just worried bringing her back
will make her worse.

644
00:53:02,986 --> 00:53:03,966
She's not well.

645
00:53:04,071 --> 00:53:05,279
I know that.

646
00:53:05,381 --> 00:53:07,036
And she's not your patient.

647
00:53:07,138 --> 00:53:09,980
I know that, too.

648
00:53:10,076 --> 00:53:11,284
She thinks it's a game.

649
00:53:11,386 --> 00:53:13,324
She's using Charlie
to get to you.

650
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:14,377
I know things

651
00:53:14,484 --> 00:53:16,140
haven't gone
as well as we hoped, but...

652
00:53:16,241 --> 00:53:18,441
do you really think
bringing her back to New York

653
00:53:18,541 --> 00:53:20,425
is going to make
that much of a difference?

654
00:53:20,521 --> 00:53:22,045
It's worth a try.

655
00:53:25,249 --> 00:53:26,294
All right, look.

656
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:28,849
I'll give it two more weeks,

657
00:53:28,954 --> 00:53:30,641
and if there's no improvement,
I'll bring her back.

658
00:55:11,196 --> 00:55:13,135
What are you doing, Daddy?

659
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,612
Nothing.

660
00:55:14,709 --> 00:55:17,486
What were you looking at?

661
00:55:17,584 --> 00:55:20,546
No, I was just getting
ready to tuck you in.

662
00:55:31,606 --> 00:55:32,749
Good night.

663
00:55:42,051 --> 00:55:43,477
Daddy?

664
00:55:45,277 --> 00:55:47,062
Yeah, sweetheart?

665
00:55:47,162 --> 00:55:49,100
Can you close the door?

666
00:55:51,282 --> 00:55:52,457
You don't want the light?

667
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:55,685
I don't need it anymore.

668
00:55:59,555 --> 00:56:00,632
Okay.

669
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,862
Hi.

670
00:57:24,964 --> 00:57:27,447
Hello. David.

671
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:29,751
I thought I'd return the favor.

672
00:57:29,851 --> 00:57:33,074
Oh, thank you.

673
00:57:34,323 --> 00:57:35,913
Mmm! Apple!

674
00:57:36,015 --> 00:57:37,736
My favorite!

675
00:57:37,836 --> 00:57:39,655
You can make yourself at home.

676
00:57:39,753 --> 00:57:40,765
I'll be back in a second.

677
00:57:40,871 --> 00:57:41,851
Thank you.

678
00:58:21,084 --> 00:58:22,707
You must think
we're pretty crazy

679
00:58:22,809 --> 00:58:24,627
keeping all these toys around.

680
00:58:26,993 --> 00:58:28,615
It's, um...

681
00:58:28,718 --> 00:58:32,573
It's hard to find the right
place for them, you know?

682
00:58:43,315 --> 00:58:45,831
I'm sorry.

683
00:58:45,934 --> 00:58:47,426
No, you have nothing
to be sorry about.

684
00:58:47,531 --> 00:58:49,763
It's just, I...

685
00:58:49,863 --> 00:58:52,444
I've had no one to talk to.

686
00:58:52,546 --> 00:58:55,029
You know that
I am a psychologist.

687
00:58:55,133 --> 00:58:57,430
I've dealt with many people

688
00:58:57,529 --> 00:58:59,119
in similar
circumstances,

689
00:58:59,221 --> 00:59:01,105
and if you
and your husband

690
00:59:01,202 --> 00:59:03,782
would like to talk about this,
it might help.

691
00:59:03,885 --> 00:59:06,335
He's... been having...

692
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:08,378
a tough time
this past couple of weeks.

693
00:59:09,761 --> 00:59:13,367
In-ln... wh-what sense?

694
00:59:15,415 --> 00:59:17,931
You have no idea
how painful it can be.

695
00:59:18,034 --> 00:59:19,787
How painful

696
00:59:19,887 --> 00:59:22,338
he can make it.

697
00:59:27,425 --> 00:59:29,755
I'm sorry.

698
00:59:29,853 --> 00:59:31,540
I've already said too much.

699
00:59:31,642 --> 00:59:32,567
Please, I can...

700
00:59:32,663 --> 00:59:34,253
Listen to me.
Please, I can help you.

701
00:59:34,357 --> 00:59:35,848
No, he'll be back any moment.

702
00:59:35,953 --> 00:59:38,088
You just talk to me.
I can help you.

703
00:59:38,189 --> 00:59:39,681
No.

704
00:59:39,786 --> 00:59:41,028
You have to go.

705
00:59:41,127 --> 00:59:42,074
Wha...?

706
01:00:13,452 --> 01:00:15,685
Hello?

707
01:00:15,783 --> 01:00:18,081
David?

708
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,604
Emily?

709
01:00:53,250 --> 01:00:55,351
Hello?

710
01:00:58,009 --> 01:00:59,414
David?

711
01:01:02,258 --> 01:01:03,716
Emily?

712
01:01:08,614 --> 01:01:10,781
Emily, are you in here?

713
01:01:14,938 --> 01:01:16,909
Didn't you hear me calling?

714
01:01:17,014 --> 01:01:19,497
Daddy's not here.

715
01:01:19,601 --> 01:01:22,912
Well, actually, it was you
that I came to see.

716
01:01:24,935 --> 01:01:27,483
Would you mind
if we talked for a moment?

717
01:01:30,429 --> 01:01:33,206
I brought you some daisies.

718
01:01:34,933 --> 01:01:36,621
I wasn't sure which one
was your favorite color,

719
01:01:36,721 --> 01:01:38,986
so I just...
got all kinds.

720
01:01:42,694 --> 01:01:45,340
Thanks.

721
01:01:48,859 --> 01:01:50,166
Emily, I'm really sorry

722
01:01:50,264 --> 01:01:52,594
about what happened
the other night.

723
01:01:52,692 --> 01:01:54,859
I want you to know
that I'm not trying

724
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,386
to come between
you and your dad.

725
01:01:56,492 --> 01:01:59,389
Do you think maybe
we could start over?

726
01:01:59,495 --> 01:02:03,285
We could be friends?

727
01:02:03,392 --> 01:02:06,104
Do you like games?

728
01:02:06,203 --> 01:02:08,719
I love games.

729
01:02:08,822 --> 01:02:12,231
Would you like to play one?

730
01:02:12,335 --> 01:02:15,842
I'm already playing.

731
01:02:15,945 --> 01:02:18,722
What game are you playing?

732
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:21,466
Hide and seek.

733
01:02:22,971 --> 01:02:24,975
Don't you need another person
to play that game?

734
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:27,019
He's hiding.

735
01:02:27,124 --> 01:02:30,946
Who's hiding?

736
01:02:31,053 --> 01:02:33,024
Charlie.

737
01:02:35,205 --> 01:02:37,306
Charlie's hiding.

738
01:02:37,409 --> 01:02:39,228
Where's he hiding?

739
01:02:52,229 --> 01:02:54,712
You stay here.

740
01:02:58,203 --> 01:03:00,468
Charlie...

741
01:03:00,566 --> 01:03:03,408
Come out, come out,
wherever you are...

742
01:03:05,773 --> 01:03:06,883
No!

743
01:03:22,126 --> 01:03:23,911
Emily?

744
01:03:24,011 --> 01:03:26,972
Em?

745
01:04:02,659 --> 01:04:04,543
Emily?

746
01:04:07,993 --> 01:04:09,844
What are you doing?

747
01:04:10,995 --> 01:04:13,130
What are you drawing, honey?

748
01:04:31,597 --> 01:04:32,937
What happened?

749
01:04:33,034 --> 01:04:34,177
Emily,

750
01:04:34,281 --> 01:04:35,587
what happened?

751
01:04:54,179 --> 01:04:55,160
Oh, hello, Sheriff.

752
01:04:57,278 --> 01:04:59,641
Mind if I come in
for a minute?

753
01:05:03,857 --> 01:05:05,676
HAFFERTY:
Afraid I have some bad news.

754
01:05:05,774 --> 01:05:07,048
There's been an accident.

755
01:05:07,147 --> 01:05:10,142
I found Elizabeth Young's car
crashed on the side of the road.

756
01:05:10,246 --> 01:05:11,389
Is she okay?

757
01:05:11,492 --> 01:05:12,504
I don't know.

758
01:05:12,610 --> 01:05:13,720
She wasn't inside.

759
01:05:13,823 --> 01:05:14,836
I spoke to her niece Amy.

760
01:05:16,027 --> 01:05:17,933
She told me
she came up here to see you.

761
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:19,117
You seen her?

762
01:05:19,221 --> 01:05:20,496
No, I haven't seen her.

763
01:05:20,594 --> 01:05:22,761
No.

764
01:05:22,862 --> 01:05:25,279
Would you mind...

765
01:05:25,385 --> 01:05:26,659
I had a glass of water?

766
01:05:26,759 --> 01:05:27,869
Sure, uh...

767
01:05:27,973 --> 01:05:29,018
Just want, uh,

768
01:05:29,122 --> 01:05:30,843
- Water, uh...?
- Yeah.

769
01:05:30,943 --> 01:05:33,012
Sure.

770
01:05:37,108 --> 01:05:38,480
At first, I thought

771
01:05:38,577 --> 01:05:41,158
she might have crashed
on the way up.

772
01:05:44,454 --> 01:05:46,011
But taking a second look.

773
01:05:47,169 --> 01:05:49,434
I seen the tire tracks
leading down the hill.

774
01:05:51,769 --> 01:05:54,001
So, she must have
at least stopped by.

775
01:05:56,113 --> 01:05:58,018
Well, maybe she
forgot something,

776
01:05:58,125 --> 01:05:59,170
or turned around, or

777
01:05:59,274 --> 01:06:00,320
I don't know,
but, uh...

778
01:06:00,425 --> 01:06:02,526
Maybe, uh...
Maybe Emily's seen her.

779
01:06:02,629 --> 01:06:04,033
No, that couldn't be.

780
01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:05,654
Emily was here upstairs.

781
01:06:05,759 --> 01:06:07,316
Could you call her?

782
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:08,661
Sure. I...

783
01:06:08,761 --> 01:06:09,904
I can call her, yeah.

784
01:06:10,007 --> 01:06:11,053
I can ask her.

785
01:06:11,157 --> 01:06:12,235
Emily...

786
01:06:13,616 --> 01:06:15,468
Emily?

787
01:06:17,481 --> 01:06:20,345
Em?

788
01:06:20,452 --> 01:06:22,303
Honey...

789
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:24,339
Come on down.
Come on.

790
01:06:27,255 --> 01:06:29,074
Hello, Emily.

791
01:06:33,068 --> 01:06:36,096
Emily, you know
Elizabeth Young?

792
01:06:39,968 --> 01:06:43,539
You seen her come by
in the last few hours?

793
01:06:47,793 --> 01:06:51,082
If I stepped away for a minute,

794
01:06:51,178 --> 01:06:54,043
you sure there's nothing
you'd want to tell your daddy?

795
01:06:56,034 --> 01:06:58,037
I'm sure.

796
01:07:00,729 --> 01:07:03,026
Good girl.

797
01:07:03,124 --> 01:07:05,541
You can go on up to your room
and play.

798
01:07:14,144 --> 01:07:15,222
Cute kid.

799
01:07:15,325 --> 01:07:16,371
Thank you.

800
01:07:16,476 --> 01:07:18,577
If you hear anything,
you'll give me a call?

801
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:20,051
I will, Sheriff.

802
01:07:20,149 --> 01:07:22,795
I will, and you can do the same.

803
01:07:22,895 --> 01:07:25,509
I want to check
around the neighborhood.

804
01:07:25,611 --> 01:07:27,016
You and Emily gonna be here?

805
01:07:27,112 --> 01:07:28,702
We'll be here.

806
01:07:28,805 --> 01:07:31,865
Just making sure.

807
01:07:34,075 --> 01:07:35,480
Thanks for the water.

808
01:07:35,576 --> 01:07:37,428
You're welcome.

809
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:46,044
Emily?

810
01:07:46,148 --> 01:07:47,934
Emily?!

811
01:07:50,908 --> 01:07:52,596
- Emily,

812
01:07:52,696 --> 01:07:53,622
where is she?

813
01:07:53,719 --> 01:07:54,764
Where is Elizabeth?

814
01:08:19,048 --> 01:08:21,084
Oh, God.

815
01:08:21,188 --> 01:08:22,396
What did you do?

816
01:08:22,498 --> 01:08:23,673
What did you do?

817
01:08:23,775 --> 01:08:25,299
- I didn't do anything!
- Who did it?

818
01:08:25,404 --> 01:08:27,157
- Who did it, then?
- Charlie.

819
01:08:27,256 --> 01:08:29,108
- Don't say Charlie.
- I'm telling you...

820
01:08:31,792 --> 01:08:33,066
What is going on?

821
01:08:33,166 --> 01:08:33,764
Charlie.

822
01:08:33,868 --> 01:08:35,426
Who is Charlie?
Where is he?

823
01:08:35,529 --> 01:08:37,468
Just, please, help me understand
what's happening here.

824
01:08:37,574 --> 01:08:39,065
I can't. I can't.

825
01:08:39,171 --> 01:08:40,281
Help me!

826
01:08:40,384 --> 01:08:42,268
I can't.

827
01:08:45,303 --> 01:08:47,056
Did you have a part in this?

828
01:08:47,156 --> 01:08:49,704
Did you have a part
in this?!

829
01:08:49,807 --> 01:08:52,006
He made me help him.

830
01:08:52,106 --> 01:08:54,491
He made me...

831
01:08:55,620 --> 01:08:56,633
He made me.

832
01:08:56,738 --> 01:08:58,524
This is him? Is this Charlie?

833
01:08:58,622 --> 01:08:59,602
I can't tell you.

834
01:08:59,709 --> 01:09:00,634
Who is this?!

835
01:09:00,730 --> 01:09:02,134
Please, I can't.

836
01:09:02,232 --> 01:09:03,158
I'm sorry.

837
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:07,148
You stay right here.

838
01:09:07,246 --> 01:09:08,836
- Don't move.
- Oh, please don't leave me.

839
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:09,952
Do not move.
You stay right here.

840
01:09:11,622 --> 01:09:14,932
You can't stop him, Daddy!

841
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:10,645
Hello?

842
01:10:10,745 --> 01:10:11,953
Emily?

843
01:10:12,054 --> 01:10:13,960
Emily, what's happening?

844
01:10:14,066 --> 01:10:16,102
I don't want to play
with Charlie anymore.

845
01:10:16,207 --> 01:10:18,951
Emily, where's your father?

846
01:10:19,050 --> 01:10:20,640
Daddy can't save me now.

847
01:10:20,742 --> 01:10:21,950
Emily?

848
01:10:23,393 --> 01:10:24,765
Emily, sweetie, are you there?

849
01:10:24,862 --> 01:10:26,550
- Are you okay?

850
01:10:45,624 --> 01:10:47,476
He just left.

851
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:52,928
Where is he?

852
01:10:53,035 --> 01:10:54,853
He's hiding!

853
01:10:54,951 --> 01:10:56,159
Where are you?!

854
01:10:56,261 --> 01:10:58,232
Where are you?!

855
01:11:17,853 --> 01:11:19,672
You.

856
01:11:22,356 --> 01:11:24,076
You. What are you doing here?

857
01:11:24,176 --> 01:11:25,352
I heard some noises.
I saw you come out

858
01:11:25,454 --> 01:11:27,207
of the woods with a shovel.
Everything all right?

859
01:11:27,307 --> 01:11:28,994
No.

860
01:11:29,096 --> 01:11:31,612
Emily all right?

861
01:11:31,715 --> 01:11:33,534
You stay away.

862
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:34,839
I want to see her.

863
01:11:34,941 --> 01:11:36,912
You stay away.
I'm gonna call the cops.

864
01:11:37,017 --> 01:11:38,193
I want to see her now.

865
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:39,274
You sick fuck.

866
01:11:39,381 --> 01:11:40,459
- I want to see her.
- Uh, stay away.

867
01:12:14,228 --> 01:12:15,502
Daddy?

868
01:12:15,601 --> 01:12:17,898
Honey... stay upstairs.

869
01:12:17,997 --> 01:12:18,944
Stay upstairs.

870
01:12:19,051 --> 01:12:20,031
Upstairs.

871
01:12:38,631 --> 01:12:39,905
You stay away!

872
01:12:40,004 --> 01:12:42,139
You stay away!

873
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:43,579
You get out of here!

874
01:12:48,564 --> 01:12:49,545
It's okay, sweetheart.

875
01:12:49,650 --> 01:12:50,793
Charlie's gone.

876
01:12:50,896 --> 01:12:51,974
- He'll come back.
- No.

877
01:12:52,077 --> 01:12:53,123
I know he will.

878
01:12:53,227 --> 01:12:55,166
No, he's gone.
He's gone.

879
01:12:55,272 --> 01:12:57,918
Please don't make me
see Charlie, Daddy.

880
01:12:58,018 --> 01:13:01,656
Please don't make me
see Charlie.

881
01:13:01,755 --> 01:13:03,378
I'm so sorry
I didn't believe you.

882
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:04,852
I'm so sorry, honey.

883
01:13:04,950 --> 01:13:06,834
Please don't
leave me again.

884
01:13:06,930 --> 01:13:09,544
Please don't leave me again.
Not again.

885
01:13:28,937 --> 01:13:32,063
Please don't make me see Charlie.

886
01:14:15,347 --> 01:14:18,690
Is Charlie here right now?

887
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:24,002
I think he's sleeping.

888
01:15:06,229 --> 01:15:09,518
Come out, come out,

889
01:15:09,615 --> 01:15:10,823
wherever you are.

890
01:15:54,620 --> 01:15:57,070
Can you see now, Daddy?

891
01:16:17,170 --> 01:16:19,076
It's okay.

892
01:16:21,417 --> 01:16:23,323
Daddy's gone now.

893
01:16:34,897 --> 01:16:36,781
Dr. Callaway?

894
01:16:38,794 --> 01:16:41,538
Anybody home?

895
01:16:53,167 --> 01:16:54,277
Hello?

896
01:17:17,378 --> 01:17:19,578
Hello?

897
01:17:32,486 --> 01:17:35,164
Emily? Hey...

898
01:17:35,265 --> 01:17:37,846
where's your dad?

899
01:17:39,833 --> 01:17:40,846
Neighbor called.

900
01:17:40,950 --> 01:17:43,085
Said there was a problem.

901
01:17:43,186 --> 01:17:44,231
Everything all right?

902
01:17:47,243 --> 01:17:48,734
What you drawing there?

903
01:17:52,130 --> 01:17:54,678
You. Dying.

904
01:18:00,594 --> 01:18:01,770
Emily?

905
01:18:19,854 --> 01:18:22,631
Marco...

906
01:18:22,729 --> 01:18:24,830
Hello?

907
01:18:38,955 --> 01:18:40,098
Dr. Callaway?

908
01:18:40,201 --> 01:18:42,368
Marco...

909
01:19:21,149 --> 01:19:22,934
Polo.

910
01:20:32,856 --> 01:20:36,842
I can't help but sense
a certain tension between us.

911
01:20:42,278 --> 01:20:44,641
What's the matter?
Don't you want to play anymore?

912
01:20:44,737 --> 01:20:46,589
Don't you want to have fun?

913
01:20:49,976 --> 01:20:52,426
You want your daddy back?
Is that it?

914
01:20:55,725 --> 01:20:57,826
You like him more than me,
don't you?

915
01:20:57,930 --> 01:20:59,301
No.

916
01:20:59,398 --> 01:21:01,336
Oh, oh, liar.

917
01:21:01,443 --> 01:21:03,130
I'm not.

918
01:21:03,231 --> 01:21:05,267
Liar, liar...

919
01:21:05,371 --> 01:21:07,604
You're a big fat liar.

920
01:21:12,430 --> 01:21:14,630
You killed Mommy.

921
01:21:26,133 --> 01:21:28,016
One, one thousand...

922
01:21:28,113 --> 01:21:30,280
Two, one thousand...

923
01:21:32,042 --> 01:21:34,459
Three, one thousand...

924
01:21:34,565 --> 01:21:36,569
Four, one thousand...

925
01:21:36,673 --> 01:21:38,557
Five, one thousand...

926
01:21:55,710 --> 01:21:57,681
Hello?

927
01:22:23,946 --> 01:22:26,461
Hello?

928
01:22:50,393 --> 01:22:53,551
Oh, God, David, you scared me.

929
01:22:56,877 --> 01:22:58,815
David?

930
01:23:36,195 --> 01:23:38,232
That's funny.

931
01:23:39,869 --> 01:23:42,102
I could've sworn
I saw a little girl

932
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:45,261
by the name of Emily
come in here.

933
01:23:46,257 --> 01:23:47,749
Emily.

934
01:23:48,749 --> 01:23:50,568
I wonder...

935
01:23:50,665 --> 01:23:54,336
where she could be.

936
01:23:54,434 --> 01:23:58,649
Could she be hiding
under the bed?

937
01:23:58,746 --> 01:24:00,150
No...

938
01:24:00,248 --> 01:24:03,754
Could she be hiding
under this bed?

939
01:24:04,911 --> 01:24:06,369
No.

940
01:24:08,775 --> 01:24:11,192
Could she be...

941
01:24:11,298 --> 01:24:15,252
hiding in the closet?

942
01:25:31,023 --> 01:25:32,069
Emily?

943
01:25:35,526 --> 01:25:37,497
Emily?

944
01:25:48,590 --> 01:25:50,245
Emily, open up for Daddy.

945
01:25:59,322 --> 01:26:00,629
Mommy misses you.

946
01:26:36,853 --> 01:26:38,344
Emily?

947
01:26:58,413 --> 01:27:01,506
Emily!

948
01:27:07,771 --> 01:27:10,870
Emily!

949
01:27:32,238 --> 01:27:37,727
Emily... your daddy's
looking for you.

950
01:29:07,134 --> 01:29:08,060
Katherine.

951
01:29:09,339 --> 01:29:11,026
Charlie?

952
01:29:11,127 --> 01:29:13,359
No, it's-it's me. It's David.

953
01:29:13,459 --> 01:29:14,667
Where is Emily?

954
01:29:14,768 --> 01:29:15,748
Katherine, I...

955
01:29:15,855 --> 01:29:16,780
- Emily!
- It's all right.

956
01:29:16,876 --> 01:29:18,183
I just want to explain
to you what it is...

957
01:29:18,281 --> 01:29:19,805
- Stay right there.
- You were right.

958
01:29:19,911 --> 01:29:21,369
- Emily!
- You were right.

959
01:29:21,476 --> 01:29:22,586
I never should've
brought her up here.

960
01:29:22,690 --> 01:29:23,615
It was a mistake.

961
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:25,618
I mean, Emily's not

962
01:29:25,724 --> 01:29:28,566
the person who's... not well.

963
01:29:28,663 --> 01:29:30,187
It's me.

964
01:29:30,291 --> 01:29:33,863
And you said it...

965
01:29:33,964 --> 01:29:36,861
"Trauma causes pain,"
and you were right.

966
01:29:38,053 --> 01:29:40,699
We're going to get you
some help, okay?

967
01:29:41,822 --> 01:29:42,748
I'm sorry.

968
01:30:01,881 --> 01:30:03,666
Dad!

969
01:30:17,947 --> 01:30:20,811
There you are.

970
01:30:20,917 --> 01:30:22,159
Don't...

971
01:30:22,259 --> 01:30:24,394
What?

972
01:30:24,495 --> 01:30:27,686
Don't hurt her.

973
01:30:27,785 --> 01:30:29,756
Why?

974
01:30:30,915 --> 01:30:32,886
She's my friend.

975
01:30:37,718 --> 01:30:40,430
I thought I was your friend.

976
01:30:40,530 --> 01:30:43,176
Please, Charlie.

977
01:31:05,315 --> 01:31:06,142
Hide and seek.

978
01:31:25,853 --> 01:31:27,411
It's okay. It's okay.

979
01:31:27,514 --> 01:31:30,291
You're safe now.

980
01:31:58,011 --> 01:31:59,830
Time for school, sweetheart.

981
01:31:59,927 --> 01:32:01,582
Okay.

982
01:32:17,974 --> 01:32:19,313
Have you got your homework?

983
01:32:19,412 --> 01:32:20,358
Yes.

984
01:32:20,465 --> 01:32:22,186
Did you brush your teeth?

985
01:32:22,286 --> 01:32:23,397
Yes.

986
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:24,447
Great.
