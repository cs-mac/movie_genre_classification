1
00:00:01,203 --> 00:00:03,422
My name is H.G. Wells.

2
00:00:03,539 --> 00:00:05,969
My friend John is Jack the Ripper.

3
00:00:05,994 --> 00:00:08,430
He's escaped from 1893
in my time machine,

4
00:00:08,455 --> 00:00:10,671
and I'm the only one who can catch him.

5
00:00:11,773 --> 00:00:14,029
I'm going to kill one
person every day...

6
00:00:14,054 --> 00:00:15,648
- Jane?
- ... until I get the time machine

7
00:00:15,673 --> 00:00:17,045
with the key.

8
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,240
Where's Jane?

9
00:00:18,265 --> 00:00:19,812
Key, or Jane dies.

10
00:00:19,837 --> 00:00:21,671
She is his only leverage over you.

11
00:00:21,696 --> 00:00:22,718
Why would he kill her?

12
00:00:22,743 --> 00:00:24,877
He will kill her just to get back at me.

13
00:00:24,902 --> 00:00:26,568
Let her go, John.

14
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:27,687
Slide it to me.

15
00:00:31,828 --> 00:00:33,527
Damn it, Wells.

16
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:37,484
You truly are a ray
of light, Miss Walker.

17
00:00:37,509 --> 00:00:39,309
You got to start calling me Jane.

18
00:00:39,334 --> 00:00:40,726
Right.

19
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:46,171
- Are you following me?
- Man, I don't know you.

20
00:01:40,443 --> 00:01:42,277
Authorities suspect arson

21
00:01:42,279 --> 00:01:45,013
in an overnight apartment fire...

22
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:56,435
Microwave on high, three minutes.

23
00:01:58,796 --> 00:02:02,230
I think that's a microwave.

24
00:02:29,735 --> 00:02:33,429
In other news, police continue
to search for the Key Killer,

25
00:02:33,454 --> 00:02:34,929
who murdered a young woman

26
00:02:34,931 --> 00:02:37,932
outside the popular
nightclub Utopia last week.

27
00:02:37,934 --> 00:02:40,538
It appears two more
attacks may be related.

28
00:02:40,563 --> 00:02:42,469
Both victims survived.

29
00:02:42,494 --> 00:02:44,439
NYPD are currently following all...

30
00:02:52,736 --> 00:02:54,036
Who are you?

31
00:02:54,178 --> 00:02:56,063
John. Who are you?

32
00:02:56,088 --> 00:02:57,554
I live here.

33
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,345
Oh, yes, Bella's roommate.

34
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,689
Yes, she said you were away on...

35
00:03:01,714 --> 00:03:02,924
on business.

36
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:04,548
Now I'm back.

37
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,353
Where's Bella?

38
00:03:06,378 --> 00:03:07,911
She's in bed.

39
00:03:09,986 --> 00:03:11,853
Is that my suit?

40
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:15,009
Yes. Yeah, it's a little snug,

41
00:03:15,034 --> 00:03:16,934
but otherwise, a nice fit.

42
00:03:17,767 --> 00:03:19,377
What the hell?

43
00:03:20,302 --> 00:03:21,935
Bella?

44
00:03:22,853 --> 00:03:24,463
Bella?

45
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:59,011

46
00:04:04,066 --> 00:04:05,737
Were you up all night with the movers?

47
00:04:05,762 --> 00:04:07,167
Did you get any sleep?

48
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:08,826
There's just no time.

49
00:04:08,851 --> 00:04:10,308
John has threatened to
kill someone every day

50
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,519
until he gets what he wants.

51
00:04:11,544 --> 00:04:13,564
There are no reports of any new victims.

52
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:16,230
And the time machine is
safe here at my house.

53
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:18,816
- All right.
- So now, can you fix it?

54
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:21,620
Uh, yes.

55
00:04:21,645 --> 00:04:23,253
I believe so.

56
00:04:23,278 --> 00:04:24,401
It'll take some time,

57
00:04:24,426 --> 00:04:27,145
but it was worth it to
keep John from escaping.

58
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,303
What's that?

59
00:04:28,328 --> 00:04:29,746
Some type of crystal.

60
00:04:29,771 --> 00:04:32,426
That is an alexandrite gemstone.

61
00:04:32,451 --> 00:04:34,738
It focuses the light
into a specific wavelength

62
00:04:34,763 --> 00:04:36,809
that allows the machine to
breach the fourth dimension.

63
00:04:36,834 --> 00:04:39,129
It is the very heart and
soul of the time machine.

64
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,820
Well, the important
thing is that we find John

65
00:04:40,845 --> 00:04:42,598
as soon as possible.

66
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,551
I have my team out looking.

67
00:04:45,527 --> 00:04:47,088
Morning.

68
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:52,512
Hello.

69
00:04:52,843 --> 00:04:53,875
Hi.

70
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,324
You look lovely.

71
00:04:55,349 --> 00:04:56,649
Thank you.

72
00:04:56,674 --> 00:04:58,840
Doug picked up some of my
things from my apartment.

73
00:04:58,864 --> 00:04:59,863
Oh.

74
00:04:59,888 --> 00:05:02,214
Ms. Anders, thank you so
much for letting me stay here.

75
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:04,191
- Your home is spectacular.
- You're welcome.

76
00:05:04,216 --> 00:05:06,111
The most important thing
is that we keep you safe

77
00:05:06,136 --> 00:05:07,472
until this is over.

78
00:05:07,497 --> 00:05:09,920
- I'll look into what we talked about.
- Yes. Thank you.

79
00:05:12,466 --> 00:05:14,862
- So, how are you holding up?
- I'm good.

80
00:05:14,887 --> 00:05:16,486
Although, the museum's pretty freaked

81
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:18,370
that Vanessa moved the whole exhibit.

82
00:05:18,395 --> 00:05:19,794
They have no idea what's going on.

83
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,452
I hope I didn't put
your job in jeopardy.

84
00:05:21,477 --> 00:05:22,573
No.

85
00:05:22,598 --> 00:05:25,683
My boss is scared that Vanessa
will sue for negligence,

86
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,722
so I told her that
Vanessa needed me here

87
00:05:27,747 --> 00:05:30,331
working on an inventory
for the insurance claim.

88
00:05:30,356 --> 00:05:31,456
Oh.

89
00:05:31,481 --> 00:05:33,706
Remember, H.G. Wells
is my responsibility.

90
00:05:33,731 --> 00:05:35,581
Oh, I am?

91
00:05:36,441 --> 00:05:38,495
Yes, you are.

92
00:05:40,576 --> 00:05:42,964
- The exhibit, that is.
- Right.

93
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:46,144
Listen, um...

94
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,737
with everything you've been through,

95
00:05:48,762 --> 00:05:51,294
if at any point you want out,

96
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,177
you tell me. I'll understand.

97
00:05:53,202 --> 00:05:54,301
Yeah.

98
00:05:54,489 --> 00:05:57,435
It's been pretty intense
the past couple days.

99
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,626
But I want to see this through.

100
00:05:59,628 --> 00:06:01,061
I want to help you.

101
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,464
Oh.

102
00:06:04,466 --> 00:06:06,154
Hello, this is Jane.

103
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:09,592
Hello, Miss Walker. How
lovely to hear your voice.

104
00:06:13,007 --> 00:06:15,108
Well, I can't say the same.

105
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,296
Well, that hurts...

106
00:06:16,321 --> 00:06:18,655
especially after spending
such quality time together.

107
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,880
- I remember it rather fondly.
- What do you want?

108
00:06:21,016 --> 00:06:22,983
I want the key and the
time machine... now.

109
00:06:22,985 --> 00:06:25,101
What do you plan on doing with it?

110
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,108
Hello, H.G.

111
00:06:27,598 --> 00:06:28,630
Well, I don't know.

112
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:29,954
Perhaps I'll go somewhere

113
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:32,812
that would allow me the
opportunity to change...

114
00:06:32,837 --> 00:06:34,303
be a good little boy.

115
00:06:34,783 --> 00:06:37,493
You see, I'm on a personal
journey of self-enlightenment,

116
00:06:37,518 --> 00:06:39,995
thanks to the eye-opening Miss Walker.

117
00:06:40,456 --> 00:06:42,212
Very well. Come and get it.

118
00:06:42,237 --> 00:06:43,642
I don't think so.

119
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:45,716
I shall call you with
the exact location,

120
00:06:45,741 --> 00:06:47,333
and you will have precisely five minutes

121
00:06:47,358 --> 00:06:50,319
to travel to me with
the machine and the key.

122
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,661
You want me to bring
the time machine to you?

123
00:06:52,686 --> 00:06:53,794
Yes.

124
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:55,885
I won't fall into one
of your traps, H.G.

125
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,076
You won't fool me again.

126
00:06:57,101 --> 00:06:58,419
Well, I can't oblige, John,

127
00:06:58,444 --> 00:07:00,144
because the time machine is broken.

128
00:07:00,475 --> 00:07:01,669
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

129
00:07:01,694 --> 00:07:04,075
- He's telling the truth, John.
- John?

130
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,033
Are we on a first-name basis?

131
00:07:06,328 --> 00:07:09,177
I like that, Jane.

132
00:07:09,904 --> 00:07:11,838
You saw me sabotage it yourself.

133
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,306
I saw some smoke and loose wires...

134
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,308
nothing the father of
time travel can't remedy.

135
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,088
I will give you 12
hours to fix the machine.

136
00:07:17,113 --> 00:07:18,645
Please don't hurt anyone.

137
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,213
I granted you life once, Jane,

138
00:07:20,215 --> 00:07:21,963
due to my growing affection for you,

139
00:07:21,988 --> 00:07:23,654
but it won't happen again.

140
00:07:23,853 --> 00:07:25,985
You know how the saying goes...

141
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,421
one step forward, two steps back.

142
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,157
You have 12 hours before I kill again.

143
00:07:32,294 --> 00:07:33,826
The clock starts now.

144
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,428
But I can't, J...

145
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,829
John?

146
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,197
John?

147
00:07:56,828 --> 00:07:59,899
H.G., Jane, this is Martin Scott.

148
00:07:59,924 --> 00:08:01,983
He works in the innovation
division at my company.

149
00:08:02,008 --> 00:08:03,015
Mr. Scott.

150
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,506
I asked Vanessa to find someone
to assist me in navigating

151
00:08:05,531 --> 00:08:09,030
some of the, uh, finer points
of 21st-century technology.

152
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:11,221
Mr. Wells, my background
is in theoretical physics

153
00:08:11,246 --> 00:08:13,013
- and quantum mechanics.
- Oh.

154
00:08:13,374 --> 00:08:16,138
It is a mind-blowing
honor to meet you, sir.

155
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,773
I've read every book you've written

156
00:08:17,775 --> 00:08:19,642
and seen every movie based on your work,

157
00:08:19,644 --> 00:08:21,401
my favorite being "The Invisible Man"...

158
00:08:21,426 --> 00:08:23,356
the Claude Rains 1933 version.

159
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,815
Movies, as in moving pictures?

160
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,416
In your time, it was a
kinetoscope cinematic device.

161
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:29,987
- Ah.
- It's evolved a lot since then.

162
00:08:30,012 --> 00:08:32,379
Ms. Anders, your appointment is waiting.

163
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,213
I'll leave you to it, then.

164
00:08:34,238 --> 00:08:35,561
Thank you.

165
00:08:35,586 --> 00:08:38,192
Mr. Scott, this key...

166
00:08:38,217 --> 00:08:40,153
currently controls where
the time machine returns

167
00:08:40,178 --> 00:08:41,356
after a journey.

168
00:08:41,381 --> 00:08:42,865
I would like you to help me change that.

169
00:08:42,867 --> 00:08:44,793
I wish to ensure the
time machine returns

170
00:08:44,818 --> 00:08:48,014
directly to this ballroom
once John Stevenson is inside.

171
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:49,672
Can I see your control board?

172
00:08:49,674 --> 00:08:52,019
Yes, you, uh, you may.

173
00:08:53,644 --> 00:08:55,283
- Hi.
- Hey, baby.

174
00:08:58,003 --> 00:09:00,716
- You look nervous.
- No, not at all.

175
00:09:02,245 --> 00:09:03,714
Okay, maybe a little bit.

176
00:09:03,739 --> 00:09:05,175
You're so cute.

177
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,467
Well, I'm still not used
to giving interviews.

178
00:09:07,492 --> 00:09:08,667
I thought you said
this was a fluff piece.

179
00:09:08,692 --> 00:09:10,236
It is, but this reporter

180
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:12,556
has a reputation for
being somewhat of a snake.

181
00:09:12,581 --> 00:09:15,511
- Well, if it's good for the campaign...
- No, I know. But...

182
00:09:15,536 --> 00:09:18,034
I signed up for this. You didn't.

183
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:20,501
It means a lot to me
that you're doing this.

184
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:22,104
And you mean a lot to me.

185
00:09:22,106 --> 00:09:23,872
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

186
00:09:23,874 --> 00:09:25,307
She's waiting for us.

187
00:09:26,877 --> 00:09:29,886
I'm so excited you both
agreed to this interview.

188
00:09:29,911 --> 00:09:31,534
Well, we love your magazine.

189
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:33,690
I'll start with a question
on everyone's mind...

190
00:09:33,715 --> 00:09:35,573
after two years of dating,

191
00:09:35,598 --> 00:09:37,347
any talk of formalizing things?

192
00:09:37,372 --> 00:09:39,206
Somebody's looking for a scoop.

193
00:09:39,231 --> 00:09:41,377
One of the most powerful
businesswomen in the world

194
00:09:41,402 --> 00:09:43,969
and a decorated war
veteran running for senator.

195
00:09:43,971 --> 00:09:45,899
It could be the wedding of the year.

196
00:09:45,924 --> 00:09:48,813
We don't really think of
ourselves as a power couple.

197
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,008
But you are.

198
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,376
Your mutually beneficial partnership

199
00:09:51,378 --> 00:09:53,412
has certainly lifted
your public profile.

200
00:09:53,414 --> 00:09:56,188
Well, that's not why
Griffin and I are together.

201
00:09:56,213 --> 00:09:58,116
Well, let's talk about something else.

202
00:09:58,118 --> 00:10:00,465
- Like Vanessa's philanthropy.
- Yes.

203
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,526
And you do so with
very little publicity.

204
00:10:03,551 --> 00:10:05,901
Why maintain such a low profile?

205
00:10:05,926 --> 00:10:08,560
Well, I've always been a private person.

206
00:10:08,562 --> 00:10:11,613
I believe our actions
speak for themselves.

207
00:10:12,465 --> 00:10:13,799
The equations you used

208
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:15,600
to calculate the
subatomic compression rate

209
00:10:15,602 --> 00:10:17,436
necessary to breach the fourth dimension

210
00:10:17,438 --> 00:10:19,862
were... super complicated,

211
00:10:19,887 --> 00:10:22,948
but I think I've got them all
inputted into the computer.

212
00:10:22,973 --> 00:10:26,160
So much information at the
very touch of your fingertips.

213
00:10:26,336 --> 00:10:28,783
I never could've imagined such a device.

214
00:10:28,808 --> 00:10:30,619
But you did.

215
00:10:30,644 --> 00:10:33,301
You called it a "world brain,"

216
00:10:33,387 --> 00:10:35,320
- a "world Encyclopedia" or...
- Ah, ah.

217
00:10:35,345 --> 00:10:37,422
He hasn't written the "World Brain" yet.

218
00:10:37,447 --> 00:10:38,490
Sorry.

219
00:10:38,492 --> 00:10:41,259
Well, perhaps this is the
exact moment I got the idea.

220
00:10:41,284 --> 00:10:43,307
Shall we test out the machine?

221
00:10:45,132 --> 00:10:47,265
Would you like to do the honor?

222
00:10:53,348 --> 00:10:54,848
Brilliant.

223
00:10:54,873 --> 00:10:57,209
That's brilliant. John will think the
key still controls the time machine.

224
00:10:57,211 --> 00:10:58,977
Let's have a go, then, shall we?

225
00:10:59,471 --> 00:11:00,737
What are you doing?

226
00:11:01,139 --> 00:11:02,440
I'm not going anywhere.

227
00:11:02,465 --> 00:11:05,285
This is just a test to see
if it's still functional.

228
00:11:17,082 --> 00:11:18,996
What's wrong now?

229
00:11:28,715 --> 00:11:31,176
Is that normal?

230
00:11:36,795 --> 00:11:38,221
What is that?

231
00:11:38,246 --> 00:11:40,355
- Excuse me for a second.
- No, I'll go.

232
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,387
No, you stay here with Chase.

233
00:11:45,394 --> 00:11:47,292
- What happened?
- He was testing the ignition.

234
00:11:47,294 --> 00:11:48,527
Are you all right?

235
00:11:48,529 --> 00:11:50,118
I'm fine, I'm fine.

236
00:11:54,236 --> 00:11:55,397
Oh.

237
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:00,915
What's wrong?

238
00:12:00,917 --> 00:12:04,385
This gem is the heart of the
temporal-distortion generator.

239
00:12:04,387 --> 00:12:07,361
The surplus energy from the
power surge has cracked it.

240
00:12:07,386 --> 00:12:09,174
You can fix it, though, right?

241
00:12:09,214 --> 00:12:10,837
No. I can't.

242
00:12:10,862 --> 00:12:12,195
It's destroyed.

243
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:15,204
We'll never meet John's deadline now.

244
00:13:07,884 --> 00:13:09,173
Oh, ah.

245
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:10,884
- Oh.
- So sorry.

246
00:13:10,909 --> 00:13:12,296
No, it's okay.

247
00:13:12,321 --> 00:13:14,290
It's not your fault.
I have carpal tunnel.

248
00:13:14,332 --> 00:13:15,656
Ah.

249
00:13:15,681 --> 00:13:17,188
Let me take a look at that for you.

250
00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:18,634
Oh.

251
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,235
It's tender,

252
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,093
but everything's structurally in order.

253
00:13:24,118 --> 00:13:25,854
Well,

254
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:28,766
I suppose I just need to
stay off the computer, right?

255
00:13:29,115 --> 00:13:31,891
So, are you a doctor
or a yoga instructor?

256
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,821
Surgeon, actually.

257
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:38,579
I knew you were too good to be true.

258
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,110
Beg your pardon?

259
00:13:44,096 --> 00:13:47,765
Looks, accent, charm, and a surgeon?

260
00:13:47,767 --> 00:13:49,532
Oh, I know your type.

261
00:13:49,557 --> 00:13:52,792
Brotherhood of the
Insufferable Hero Complex.

262
00:13:52,826 --> 00:13:54,924
Slice first, ask questions later.

263
00:13:55,705 --> 00:13:58,010
Mm. That sounded much
more charming in my head.

264
00:13:58,035 --> 00:14:00,643
Hi. I'm Brooke. I'm a neuropathologist.

265
00:14:00,668 --> 00:14:03,830
Obviously, I'm still trying to
figure out my own brain damage.

266
00:14:03,855 --> 00:14:05,260
Neurology?

267
00:14:05,285 --> 00:14:07,854
I've always been fascinated.

268
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:10,719
It's an underrepresented
speciality where I'm from.

269
00:14:10,744 --> 00:14:12,744
Well, there's still so
much we have to discover.

270
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,125
And so little we can do
to fix what goes wrong.

271
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,571
- Hmm.
- But of course,

272
00:14:16,573 --> 00:14:18,109
great advancements have been made.

273
00:14:18,134 --> 00:14:19,617
No, you were right the first time.

274
00:14:19,642 --> 00:14:21,932
But I'm working on it.

275
00:14:22,123 --> 00:14:24,784
Well, I fear humanity
must wait a bit longer.

276
00:14:24,979 --> 00:14:27,682
I would be honored to buy you a drink.

277
00:14:31,777 --> 00:14:33,667
Can't we just get another one?

278
00:14:33,692 --> 00:14:36,761
The alexandrite was mined in
the Ural Mountains in the 1600s.

279
00:14:36,786 --> 00:14:38,456
It was rare in 1893.

280
00:14:38,481 --> 00:14:40,972
And it must be this exact size and cut.

281
00:14:40,997 --> 00:14:42,917
It might not even exist now.

282
00:14:42,942 --> 00:14:44,809
How does this stone
allow for time travel?

283
00:14:44,834 --> 00:14:47,433
The facets of the gemstone
have been carefully cut

284
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:48,778
to reflect a beam of light

285
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,915
that allow the machine to
pierce the very fabric of time.

286
00:14:51,917 --> 00:14:54,990
You created the laser all
the way back in the 1890s.

287
00:14:56,745 --> 00:14:58,888
There's a gemologist I
met through the museum.

288
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,058
We've used him to appraise
antique jewelry for us.

289
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:03,126
If anyone can find an
extinct Russian rock,

290
00:15:03,151 --> 00:15:04,394
it's him.

291
00:15:04,715 --> 00:15:06,189
The clock is ticking.

292
00:15:06,214 --> 00:15:07,994
Doug, any word on John Stevenson?

293
00:15:08,019 --> 00:15:09,686
He's using burner
phones, then tossing them.

294
00:15:09,688 --> 00:15:10,769
Impossible to trace.

295
00:15:10,794 --> 00:15:12,499
I'm following the police investigation.

296
00:15:12,524 --> 00:15:14,316
They don't have much yet.

297
00:15:23,201 --> 00:15:25,134
Sam?

298
00:15:28,172 --> 00:15:29,925
Sam?

299
00:15:32,384 --> 00:15:34,752
Sam's gone for groceries.

300
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,962
Where's my tea?

301
00:15:38,633 --> 00:15:40,433
No, not Sam.

302
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:41,857
It's me.

303
00:15:41,882 --> 00:15:43,595
It's Chad...

304
00:15:43,761 --> 00:15:45,468
your son.

305
00:15:45,493 --> 00:15:48,343
Mom, you know me.

306
00:15:50,405 --> 00:15:55,146
Chad, you've come to see me.

307
00:15:55,171 --> 00:15:56,566
Just for a few minutes.

308
00:15:56,591 --> 00:15:58,311
Sam can't find me here.

309
00:15:58,336 --> 00:16:01,264
Sam... h-he's getting groceries.

310
00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:02,757
And he'll be back soon.

311
00:16:02,782 --> 00:16:04,340
But I had to see you.

312
00:16:04,342 --> 00:16:05,441
It's happening.

313
00:16:05,443 --> 00:16:07,410
What's happening?

314
00:16:07,786 --> 00:16:10,587
The time machine. H.G. Wells.

315
00:16:12,017 --> 00:16:14,450
H.G. Wells.

316
00:16:14,452 --> 00:16:15,952
He's in New York.

317
00:16:15,954 --> 00:16:19,368
He's here now. He came
in his time machine.

318
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,311
Are you sure it's really him?

319
00:16:24,912 --> 00:16:27,622
- Did he bring the Ripper with him?
- Yes.

320
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,509
They're both here.

321
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:33,256
It's all real, Mom, just as you said.

322
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:36,039
Then you can stop them.

323
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,319
There's still time.

324
00:16:37,344 --> 00:16:39,142
Don't let them go back.

325
00:16:39,144 --> 00:16:41,733
You can stop this all from happening.

326
00:16:41,758 --> 00:16:43,342
Please, stop.

327
00:16:44,758 --> 00:16:47,279
Okay, Mom, I will.

328
00:16:47,435 --> 00:16:48,875
Just breathe.

329
00:16:59,194 --> 00:17:00,601
I have to go, Mom.

330
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:03,433
It's important you not
tell Sam I was here.

331
00:17:06,414 --> 00:17:08,516
I love you, Mom.

332
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:28,253
Excuse me, sir, can I help you?

333
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:31,289
I was just, uh, wondering
what all the noise was earlier.

334
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,613
Griffin. I was afraid you left.

335
00:17:33,638 --> 00:17:36,168
No, no. The reporter left...

336
00:17:36,193 --> 00:17:38,152
very confused. I'm still here.

337
00:17:38,177 --> 00:17:39,784
I'm so sorry.

338
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:43,572
You've been apologizing a lot lately.

339
00:17:43,597 --> 00:17:46,504
Instead, how about you
tell me what's going on?

340
00:17:46,506 --> 00:17:48,464
Ever since George arrived,

341
00:17:48,489 --> 00:17:50,496
you've been canceling plans,

342
00:17:50,521 --> 00:17:51,609
- making excuses...
- No.

343
00:17:51,611 --> 00:17:53,652
...you rush off in the
middle of an interview

344
00:17:53,677 --> 00:17:55,957
I-it took my staff weeks to set up.

345
00:17:55,982 --> 00:17:58,049
- I'll call to reschedule.
- No, that's not the point.

346
00:17:58,051 --> 00:18:01,017
I didn't ask you to give
that interview. You offered.

347
00:18:01,042 --> 00:18:03,142
If you don't want to be
a part of my campaign,

348
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:04,255
that's fine, just tell me.

349
00:18:04,257 --> 00:18:06,097
- That's not it.
- Then what is it?

350
00:18:06,122 --> 00:18:09,058
Why can't you share with me what's
really going on in your life?

351
00:18:09,292 --> 00:18:11,329
I want to explain all of this to you,

352
00:18:11,331 --> 00:18:13,331
but right now, I just
need you to trust me.

353
00:18:13,441 --> 00:18:16,100
Trust that I am making the
right decisions for both of us.

354
00:18:16,102 --> 00:18:17,836
I've been trusting you,

355
00:18:17,838 --> 00:18:20,003
especially since George got here.

356
00:18:20,028 --> 00:18:22,284
So, when are you gonna
start trusting me, Vanessa?

357
00:18:22,309 --> 00:18:24,589
- I do trust you, Griffin.
- Baby...

358
00:18:26,964 --> 00:18:28,884
what was it you said back there...

359
00:18:28,909 --> 00:18:31,049
"Our actions speak for themselves"?

360
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,757
It's not that I don't
see the appeal of surgery,

361
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:42,427
I just figured out very early
on that I'd be terrible at it.

362
00:18:42,429 --> 00:18:43,795
Oh, nonsense.

363
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,941
You have a surplus of talent.

364
00:18:45,966 --> 00:18:48,343
The rest is just practice, repetition.

365
00:18:48,368 --> 00:18:49,913
Oh, no.

366
00:18:50,249 --> 00:18:51,380
No way.

367
00:18:51,405 --> 00:18:53,599
What you do is a form of performance.

368
00:18:53,624 --> 00:18:56,457
With my work, I spend
most of my time thinking.

369
00:18:56,482 --> 00:18:58,510
I wander in 1,000 different directions,

370
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:02,080
and then, only when I'm
as ready as I'll ever be,

371
00:19:02,082 --> 00:19:03,559
then I test.

372
00:19:03,584 --> 00:19:06,453
Yes, but if you don't like how it goes,

373
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,313
you test a different way.

374
00:19:08,338 --> 00:19:09,504
Step and repeat.

375
00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:10,845
I don't get that luxury.

376
00:19:10,861 --> 00:19:13,915
No, but you're completely in the moment.

377
00:19:14,118 --> 00:19:15,993
You have a human being
lying in front of you...

378
00:19:16,018 --> 00:19:17,970
their body open, their heart beating.

379
00:19:17,995 --> 00:19:19,173
It's...

380
00:19:20,894 --> 00:19:24,072
Yes, you have your talent...

381
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:25,767
and your training,

382
00:19:25,792 --> 00:19:27,759
but it's your instinct,

383
00:19:28,338 --> 00:19:30,829
your courage of precision.

384
00:19:30,854 --> 00:19:33,454
Mm. Surgery is primal.

385
00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:37,277
I guess there is an
addictive quality to it,

386
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:39,241
knowing that a life is in you hands.

387
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:41,928
There it is,

388
00:19:41,953 --> 00:19:44,452
the hero complex I was talking about.

389
00:19:44,477 --> 00:19:46,632
Sometimes I fear the
drive to do what I do

390
00:19:46,657 --> 00:19:49,382
doesn't always come
from a place of heroism.

391
00:19:49,936 --> 00:19:51,671
Where does it come from?

392
00:19:51,696 --> 00:19:53,788
It's about power, isn't it?

393
00:19:54,347 --> 00:19:55,905
Control.

394
00:19:56,162 --> 00:19:58,169
Who lives, who dies.

395
00:19:58,194 --> 00:19:59,708
Whoo.

396
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:02,942
Forgive me.

397
00:20:02,967 --> 00:20:05,606
Hey, I know a lot of surgeons.

398
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:08,239
At least you're honest about it.

399
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:11,676
Most are too egotistical
to truly see themselves.

400
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:14,500
The only reason our
brains tell us we're flawed

401
00:20:14,525 --> 00:20:16,925
is so that we find a way to be better.

402
00:20:17,203 --> 00:20:18,578
Besides...

403
00:20:18,947 --> 00:20:21,547
there's nothing wrong
with the occasional...

404
00:20:21,572 --> 00:20:23,219
evil thought.

405
00:20:28,593 --> 00:20:30,294
Somewhere you have to be?

406
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:32,922
More like a deadline
I've promised to keep.

407
00:20:33,675 --> 00:20:35,820
Oh. Well...

408
00:20:36,773 --> 00:20:38,592
thanks for the drink.

409
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:41,554
Leaving so soon?

410
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:43,805
You just said you have a deadline.

411
00:20:44,459 --> 00:20:46,878
Something tells me I'm going to make it.

412
00:20:53,597 --> 00:20:55,530
This isn't your fault.

413
00:20:55,532 --> 00:20:57,644
Yes, it is... all of it.

414
00:20:57,867 --> 00:20:59,222
I brought John here.

415
00:20:59,247 --> 00:21:00,964
Every person he harms, it's my fault.

416
00:21:00,989 --> 00:21:02,699
How were you supposed to
know he was Jack the Ripper?

417
00:21:02,724 --> 00:21:04,277
That's not the point.

418
00:21:04,302 --> 00:21:06,753
He keeps killing people,
and I can't stop him.

419
00:21:06,778 --> 00:21:08,611
Every person he kills alters the future.

420
00:21:08,636 --> 00:21:10,821
These people... they're
not supposed to die now.

421
00:21:10,846 --> 00:21:13,355
There's no telling the damage
it's caused or what it's destroyed.

422
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,863
But you're here.

423
00:21:14,888 --> 00:21:16,554
Aren't you altering the timeline?

424
00:21:16,585 --> 00:21:18,018
Yes, and I shouldn't be.

425
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,420
Time travel is meant
for observation only.

426
00:21:21,124 --> 00:21:23,636
How can you be so sure of that?

427
00:21:24,646 --> 00:21:27,229
We can talk science all day, but...

428
00:21:27,254 --> 00:21:30,503
I don't think you could
take fate and destiny

429
00:21:30,528 --> 00:21:32,182
out of the equation.

430
00:21:33,478 --> 00:21:36,947
I think you were always
supposed to come to New York.

431
00:21:37,877 --> 00:21:40,374
You and I were always supposed to meet.

432
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,424
Because if this is just a
mistake in the fabric of time,

433
00:21:43,449 --> 00:21:45,360
well, that would just suck.

434
00:21:47,655 --> 00:21:49,329
That would suck.

435
00:21:50,985 --> 00:21:53,243
I'm sorry, I am babbling so much.

436
00:21:53,268 --> 00:21:55,649
No. No, no, no, never.

437
00:21:56,632 --> 00:21:59,503
When I met you, um, I must admit,

438
00:21:59,528 --> 00:22:02,024
I was first drawn to your beauty,

439
00:22:02,766 --> 00:22:05,390
the way you light up by merely being.

440
00:22:05,415 --> 00:22:06,634
And then, it was your kindness

441
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,032
that emerged as your
most luminous feature.

442
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:13,087
But now I see that you
are the sum of many parts,

443
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,876
with your mind leading the way.

444
00:22:18,528 --> 00:22:22,364
I am completely blinded
by you, Miss Walker...

445
00:22:22,389 --> 00:22:23,717
Jane.

446
00:22:27,716 --> 00:22:29,246
Sorry. Phone.

447
00:22:29,364 --> 00:22:31,059
Yes, I see that.

448
00:22:32,189 --> 00:22:33,771
It's my friend Paul.

449
00:22:33,796 --> 00:22:35,896
He may be able to help us.

450
00:23:15,326 --> 00:23:17,716
If Paul is right and he
has the gemstone we need,

451
00:23:17,741 --> 00:23:19,966
we should be back at the
time machine within the hour.

452
00:23:19,991 --> 00:23:21,356
I have long been fascinated

453
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,042
by mechanically propelled vehicles.

454
00:23:23,067 --> 00:23:25,334
Turn left at the next light.

455
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:27,059
And it talks, too?

456
00:23:28,232 --> 00:23:30,130
This is amazing.

457
00:23:30,966 --> 00:23:32,323
I gather that the speed of the vehicle

458
00:23:32,325 --> 00:23:34,449
is controlled by that
first foot lever, there.

459
00:23:34,474 --> 00:23:35,907
It's called a gas pedal.

460
00:23:35,932 --> 00:23:38,372
The other one is the
brake, for stopping.

461
00:23:38,794 --> 00:23:41,114
Tell me, Doug, how long
have you worked for Vanessa?

462
00:23:41,139 --> 00:23:42,365
13 years.

463
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:45,411
I was head of security at
her company for eight years,

464
00:23:45,436 --> 00:23:48,737
then moved over to her personal
detail for the last five.

465
00:23:48,981 --> 00:23:50,981
Before that, I was an army boy.

466
00:23:51,006 --> 00:23:52,691
Impressive.

467
00:24:03,829 --> 00:24:05,420
I'll wait here.

468
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:07,473
You have my cell if you need me.

469
00:24:07,498 --> 00:24:09,524
- Thank you, Doug.
- Thank you.

470
00:24:24,808 --> 00:24:26,811
Jane, how are you?

471
00:24:27,739 --> 00:24:30,090
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

472
00:24:30,115 --> 00:24:32,615
Um, Paul, this is my friend
George. George, this is Paul.

473
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,865
- Hi, there.
- Pleasure.

474
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,412
Everyone's gone for
the night. It's just me.

475
00:24:36,437 --> 00:24:37,771
This way.

476
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:50,695
Sorry to bother you, but I
didn't know who else to call.

477
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,922
No problem.

478
00:24:51,947 --> 00:24:53,961
I was hoping to hear from you someday.

479
00:24:53,986 --> 00:24:56,959
- May I ask... what is this place?
- It's the Gemology Institute.

480
00:24:56,984 --> 00:24:58,290
Paul is a gemologist.

481
00:24:58,315 --> 00:25:00,531
Well, I mainly work in trade now...

482
00:25:00,556 --> 00:25:02,576
rare rocks and gemstones.

483
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:04,953
You know, Coldplay was
at the Garden last week.

484
00:25:04,955 --> 00:25:06,836
I thought about you.

485
00:25:06,861 --> 00:25:09,158
- Really, Coldplay?
- What is Coldplay?

486
00:25:09,183 --> 00:25:10,740
Coldplay is a band.

487
00:25:10,765 --> 00:25:13,054
They have this one album
that we both really like.

488
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:14,857
You don't know Coldplay?

489
00:25:14,882 --> 00:25:16,205
No, I'm sorry.

490
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,639
George is from London.

491
00:25:17,664 --> 00:25:19,202
So is Coldplay.

492
00:25:20,147 --> 00:25:22,273
So, you have the alexandrite gemstone?

493
00:25:22,298 --> 00:25:23,903
Yeah. It's right up here.

494
00:25:23,944 --> 00:25:26,108
You know, Jane, you look really good.

495
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:28,522
Thank you. So do you.

496
00:25:28,814 --> 00:25:29,947
Crossfit.

497
00:25:29,972 --> 00:25:31,947
I've really been working
my core, you know,

498
00:25:31,949 --> 00:25:33,649
upping my game at the gym.

499
00:25:35,554 --> 00:25:37,335
Shall we continue?

500
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,043
Yeah.

501
00:25:57,027 --> 00:25:58,852
I don't have many for
you to choose from,

502
00:25:58,877 --> 00:26:01,736
but please put the gloves on
before you touch the stones.

503
00:26:01,761 --> 00:26:02,870
Take a look at what's here.

504
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:05,761
There may be a few more in the safe.

505
00:26:08,011 --> 00:26:10,604
- Is that the right size?
- Uh...

506
00:26:11,065 --> 00:26:14,948
well, it needs to be type
1 with high clarity...

507
00:26:15,182 --> 00:26:16,658
like these.

508
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,300
Knock yourself out.

509
00:26:20,464 --> 00:26:22,518
So, are you still at the museum?

510
00:26:22,573 --> 00:26:24,032
I took a couple weeks off.

511
00:26:24,057 --> 00:26:26,589
I'm doing some consulting at
Vanessa Anders' foundation.

512
00:26:26,614 --> 00:26:27,964
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

513
00:26:27,989 --> 00:26:29,675
- Is that what this is about?
- Yeah.

514
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,347
- She's gonna cover all the costs.
- Great.

515
00:26:33,323 --> 00:26:36,311
So, uh, you and, um...

516
00:26:37,948 --> 00:26:40,776
- George.
- George, yes...

517
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,259
... a thing?

518
00:26:42,284 --> 00:26:44,347
I'll stop flirting with you if it is.

519
00:26:44,372 --> 00:26:46,021
Oh, I doubt that.

520
00:26:46,023 --> 00:26:47,322
Excuse me?

521
00:26:47,324 --> 00:26:49,104
George and I are...

522
00:26:49,985 --> 00:26:52,073
- friends.
- Thought so.

523
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:56,965
Uh, Paul, I am looking for
something with a level-six tone.

524
00:26:56,967 --> 00:26:59,352
Level six, got it.

525
00:26:59,377 --> 00:27:00,928
I'll check the safe.

526
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,797
If it's not too much trouble.

527
00:27:08,508 --> 00:27:10,112
I'm sorry about that.

528
00:27:10,114 --> 00:27:12,281
Paul and I went out on a few dates.

529
00:27:12,283 --> 00:27:13,969
I should've mentioned that before.

530
00:27:13,994 --> 00:27:15,516
You went out with him?

531
00:27:15,916 --> 00:27:17,582
You seem surprised.

532
00:27:18,221 --> 00:27:21,039
He... he doesn't seem your type.

533
00:27:21,227 --> 00:27:22,624
Really?

534
00:27:22,875 --> 00:27:24,575
And what is my type?

535
00:27:24,788 --> 00:27:27,040
Someone, uh,

536
00:27:27,065 --> 00:27:29,867
a little less congratulatory.

537
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,039
Ignore him. He's just being a guy.

538
00:27:33,064 --> 00:27:35,531
He completely lacks subtlety.

539
00:27:35,806 --> 00:27:37,825
Well, perhaps it's all that crossfit.

540
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:48,519
We went out a couple times
and nothing came out of it.

541
00:27:48,544 --> 00:27:49,918
No sparks.

542
00:27:50,241 --> 00:27:51,582
"Sparks?"

543
00:27:51,973 --> 00:27:53,223
You know...

544
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:56,036
that electricity between two people.

545
00:27:56,309 --> 00:27:59,903
That undefinable spark of attraction.

546
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,426
You must have felt it
before. You've been married.

547
00:28:03,667 --> 00:28:06,520
Yes, uh, I was married...

548
00:28:06,567 --> 00:28:08,355
"was" being the operative word.

549
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,004
What went wrong?

550
00:28:10,582 --> 00:28:14,216
Uh, Isabel never really understood me.

551
00:28:14,218 --> 00:28:16,059
My passions to explore and discover,

552
00:28:16,084 --> 00:28:18,151
they... they held no interest to her.

553
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:22,012
And we both knew it wasn't right.

554
00:28:24,356 --> 00:28:26,897
And how does one find the right person?

555
00:28:28,765 --> 00:28:30,900
Or do they find us?

556
00:28:32,469 --> 00:28:34,952
Perhaps fate does indeed play a hand.

557
00:28:36,473 --> 00:28:38,774
So, now you do believe in fate.

558
00:28:42,123 --> 00:28:43,923
I know you had a lot
on your plate today.

559
00:28:43,948 --> 00:28:45,614
I really appreciate you coming back.

560
00:28:45,639 --> 00:28:47,272
This is where I want to be, Vanessa.

561
00:28:47,297 --> 00:28:50,389
I just... I want to know
what's going on with you.

562
00:28:53,368 --> 00:28:54,961
- Vanessa...
- This isn't easy, Griffin.

563
00:28:54,986 --> 00:28:57,180
Nothing about our
relationship has been easy,

564
00:28:57,205 --> 00:28:58,371
but I love you.

565
00:28:58,396 --> 00:29:00,352
Whatever it is, I can handle it.

566
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:04,291
What if I told you that George...

567
00:29:04,316 --> 00:29:06,525
is really H.G. Wells,

568
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,720
who traveled here in that time machine

569
00:29:08,745 --> 00:29:11,045
that is now sitting in my ballroom?

570
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:17,942
I would say, "You've
lost your damn mind."

571
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:23,510
Oh, my God, you're serious.

572
00:29:23,535 --> 00:29:25,888
Y-you can't possibly believe this.

573
00:29:25,913 --> 00:29:27,613
This is why I haven't told you.

574
00:29:27,638 --> 00:29:29,653
Sweetheart, this guy is
obviously playing you.

575
00:29:29,678 --> 00:29:31,700
Are you giving him money?

576
00:29:31,725 --> 00:29:33,607
This is a DNA and genealogy test.

577
00:29:33,632 --> 00:29:35,131
I had it done on both of us.

578
00:29:35,156 --> 00:29:36,693
The results are conclusive...

579
00:29:36,718 --> 00:29:38,708
we are related.

580
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,513
You are a very wealthy woman.

581
00:29:40,538 --> 00:29:43,068
People know about your
preoccupation with H.G. Wells

582
00:29:43,093 --> 00:29:44,364
and that you own the exhibit.

583
00:29:44,389 --> 00:29:47,075
Now you have some punk
pretending to be Wells

584
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,553
living in your home.

585
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,910
He's taking you for a ride.

586
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:53,983
- I'm gonna take care of this.
- Don't.

587
00:29:54,008 --> 00:29:56,575
I'm not gonna sit back and
watch him make a fool of you.

588
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,530
I trusted you with this.
Now I need you to trust me.

589
00:29:59,555 --> 00:30:03,053
Vanessa, I'm really
worried about you right now.

590
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,420
I don't know if I can.

591
00:30:14,191 --> 00:30:16,132
I know why you're single.

592
00:30:16,157 --> 00:30:17,991
Oh, yeah?

593
00:30:18,294 --> 00:30:21,684
It's because you're a goddess
searching for your equal,

594
00:30:21,709 --> 00:30:24,317
and you'll settle for no less.

595
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:31,145
Mm.

596
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:34,733
Uh-oh.

597
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:36,879
Too intimate?

598
00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:39,844
Did I discover another
one of your issues?

599
00:30:41,029 --> 00:30:42,590
Perhaps you did.

600
00:30:42,778 --> 00:30:45,877
Well, then I guess I won't be
asking you to stay the night.

601
00:30:45,902 --> 00:30:47,836
Were you going to?

602
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:52,364
It would be out of
character for me, but...

603
00:30:53,844 --> 00:30:55,333
yes.

604
00:30:55,837 --> 00:30:57,770
I was going to...

605
00:30:58,239 --> 00:31:01,083
if your intimacy issues can handle it.

606
00:31:01,233 --> 00:31:04,825
Well, I think they can handle it.

607
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:07,151
I'm gonna go make a drink.

608
00:31:07,176 --> 00:31:08,457
Would you like one?

609
00:31:08,459 --> 00:31:11,348
No, I'm good, but you help yourself.

610
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,606
I think I have what you're looking for.

611
00:31:59,809 --> 00:32:01,787
Ah, thank you.

612
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,571
This is exactly what we need.

613
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,870
You just need to sign for
it. Let me get the papers.

614
00:32:13,895 --> 00:32:15,261
Thank you.

615
00:32:23,299 --> 00:32:26,892
Well... your friend
has redeemed himself.

616
00:32:26,917 --> 00:32:28,617
Oh, good.

617
00:32:37,677 --> 00:32:39,277
Did you hear that?

618
00:32:39,766 --> 00:32:42,200
Paul? Is everything all right?

619
00:32:49,377 --> 00:32:51,095
Paul!

620
00:32:53,268 --> 00:32:54,801
Follow me, this way.

621
00:32:54,826 --> 00:32:56,193
Go, go, go.

622
00:33:10,963 --> 00:33:12,547
This way.

623
00:33:16,987 --> 00:33:19,213
I know you're in here!

624
00:33:27,931 --> 00:33:30,501
I know who you are, H.G. Wells.

625
00:33:30,526 --> 00:33:33,376
I know all about your time machine.

626
00:33:35,071 --> 00:33:37,400
I know about the Ripper, too.

627
00:33:37,425 --> 00:33:39,454
Go, go, go, go, go.

628
00:34:15,245 --> 00:34:16,383
Ow.

629
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,852
No, no, no.

630
00:34:44,493 --> 00:34:45,740
Doug.

631
00:34:45,742 --> 00:34:47,601
Who's the guy? I heard gunshots.

632
00:34:47,626 --> 00:34:49,085
I-I don't know, but I
have seen this man before.

633
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,109
He was following me.

634
00:34:50,111 --> 00:34:52,679
You two need to get
out of here. I got this.

635
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,934
Thank you.

636
00:35:03,572 --> 00:35:05,246
Paul will cooperate.

637
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:07,595
I'll pay for the damage,
and he'll keep quiet.

638
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,437
Paul's a good guy. We can trust him.

639
00:35:09,462 --> 00:35:10,509
I still do not understand

640
00:35:10,534 --> 00:35:12,516
why that man was trying to kill me.

641
00:35:12,541 --> 00:35:14,227
How did he know me and the Ripper?

642
00:35:14,252 --> 00:35:15,684
All these years, I
thought I was the only one

643
00:35:15,709 --> 00:35:17,613
who knew you'd come to New York.

644
00:35:17,638 --> 00:35:19,437
Could he be someone I
have yet to encounter?

645
00:35:19,439 --> 00:35:21,584
Perhaps I met him in
my future, but his past.

646
00:35:21,609 --> 00:35:23,998
That wouldn't explain why
he wanted to shoot you.

647
00:35:24,023 --> 00:35:26,068
Doug has a contact at
the police department.

648
00:35:26,093 --> 00:35:27,678
He'll call when they ID the body.

649
00:35:29,481 --> 00:35:30,915
It's Martin.

650
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,948
He's ready for you to
install the new gemstone.

651
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,526
Initiating remote
activation sequence now.

652
00:35:51,551 --> 00:35:53,480
Set the calibration to
bring the time machine back

653
00:35:53,505 --> 00:35:56,059
to this very location a
second after it launches

654
00:35:56,084 --> 00:35:58,553
in order to prevent another
break in the time-space continuum.

655
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,809
Vanessa?

656
00:36:02,015 --> 00:36:04,926
I believe everyone here knows Griffin.

657
00:36:05,277 --> 00:36:07,573
Actions speak for themselves.

658
00:36:07,598 --> 00:36:09,220
Well, watch this.

659
00:36:15,889 --> 00:36:18,390
All the power levels are
ready to accept the parameters.

660
00:36:42,421 --> 00:36:44,246
No way.

661
00:36:44,271 --> 00:36:45,723
How?

662
00:36:45,725 --> 00:36:47,286
It's incredible.

663
00:36:48,854 --> 00:36:51,188
So, that's it? The trap is ready?

664
00:36:51,544 --> 00:36:53,849
John can get in, set
whatever date he wants.

665
00:36:53,874 --> 00:36:55,505
He's only gonna go
where we want him to go.

666
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:56,796
Great.

667
00:36:57,184 --> 00:36:58,989
Good evening, H.G.

668
00:36:59,222 --> 00:37:01,633
I'm sending you a movie.

669
00:37:01,658 --> 00:37:03,180
Not one you're going
to enjoy, I'm afraid,

670
00:37:03,205 --> 00:37:06,039
but I hope you'll at least
appreciate my clever application

671
00:37:06,064 --> 00:37:07,891
of modern technology.

672
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,553
Though, unfortunately,

673
00:37:10,578 --> 00:37:12,750
I'm unable to honor our deadline.

674
00:37:12,752 --> 00:37:16,087
I met a fascinating woman.

675
00:37:16,089 --> 00:37:18,305
In her company, I've...

676
00:37:18,624 --> 00:37:21,883
begun to feel all too... human.

677
00:37:22,894 --> 00:37:26,656
But as we both know, what I truly am...

678
00:37:26,805 --> 00:37:28,305
is an animal.

679
00:37:28,330 --> 00:37:31,148
There is no redemption for my soul,

680
00:37:31,547 --> 00:37:33,404
no matter the cost.

681
00:37:36,234 --> 00:37:39,242
Then, I must be true to my nature.

682
00:37:39,612 --> 00:37:43,430
But perhaps, it will
bring you satisfaction

683
00:37:43,455 --> 00:37:44,945
to know that...

684
00:37:46,408 --> 00:37:48,352
I will feel regret.

685
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,426
Hmm.

686
00:37:59,892 --> 00:38:01,132
It's late...

687
00:38:02,574 --> 00:38:04,602
... to have music on.

688
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:10,019
Oh, how do you still have the energy?

689
00:38:10,044 --> 00:38:11,861
You inspire me.

690
00:38:36,297 --> 00:38:38,009
What did you do?

691
00:38:40,806 --> 00:38:42,455
Delete.

692
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:48,705
It's about time.

693
00:38:50,166 --> 00:38:52,736
I was beginning to
think you'd gone soft.

694
00:38:52,761 --> 00:38:54,142
What have you done?

695
00:39:03,516 --> 00:39:05,688
Ooh, blimey.

696
00:39:06,547 --> 00:39:08,999
Look at it. It's bursting with energy.

697
00:39:09,001 --> 00:39:10,672
It's fully live and operational,

698
00:39:10,697 --> 00:39:12,547
but John hasn't called.

699
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,656
Do you think he's gonna kill again?

700
00:39:17,157 --> 00:39:18,977
We shall catch him.

701
00:39:19,574 --> 00:39:23,000
Today, when that man had
his gun pointed at you...

702
00:39:23,164 --> 00:39:24,883
that was real...

703
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:27,492
too real.

704
00:39:29,699 --> 00:39:31,652
- You want out.
- No.

705
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,707
I want in.

706
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,254
Yes, today was scary,

707
00:39:36,279 --> 00:39:38,329
but it proved something...

708
00:39:38,902 --> 00:39:40,871
that I want to do this.

709
00:39:40,964 --> 00:39:44,433
Because somehow, I think
I'm supposed to be here.

710
00:39:44,941 --> 00:39:46,904
You asked me if I believe in fate.

711
00:39:46,906 --> 00:39:48,770
Well, Jane, I believe...

712
00:39:48,795 --> 00:39:50,975
there are certain moments
in one's life that...

713
00:39:50,977 --> 00:39:52,977
defy understanding.

714
00:39:52,979 --> 00:39:56,542
Moments that are rare and special...

715
00:39:58,184 --> 00:40:00,084
...and precious.

716
00:40:00,863 --> 00:40:02,720
And this moment?

717
00:40:02,722 --> 00:40:04,321
Oh, I believe very much so

718
00:40:04,323 --> 00:40:06,528
that this moment was destined to happen.

719
00:40:11,863 --> 00:40:13,297
Did that just happen?

720
00:40:13,299 --> 00:40:14,746
Well, it's merely a thermionic emission

721
00:40:14,771 --> 00:40:16,761
- of electrons from the, uh...
- Right.

722
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,734
All good here.

723
00:40:35,759 --> 00:40:37,246
Worked like a charm.

724
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:39,976
I now have access to the time machine.

725
00:40:41,259 --> 00:40:43,164
But there's a problem...

726
00:40:44,101 --> 00:40:46,195
someone else knows about Wells.

727
00:40:46,499 --> 00:40:49,164
We have to find out
who else is out there.

728
00:41:01,613 --> 00:41:04,031
Good evening, Dr. Stevenson...

729
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:06,664
or do you prefer Jack the Ripper?

730
00:41:09,687 --> 00:41:11,304
Who are you?

731
00:41:11,499 --> 00:41:14,577
I'm someone who's been waiting
a very long time to meet you.

732
00:41:19,241 --> 00:41:21,140
Shh.

733
00:41:25,677 --> 00:41:29,782
