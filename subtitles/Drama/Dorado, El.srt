1
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,599
# Our glorious city

2
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,762
# Was built by the divinities

3
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:41,201
# By gods who saw fit

4
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,639
# To bestow

5
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:50,727
# The gift of a paradise

6
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:57,001
# Peaceful and harmonious upon

7
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:01,009
# Us mere mortals below

8
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,290
# And made El Dorado

9
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:11,279
# The magnificent and golden

10
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:14,845
# One thousand years ago

11
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:20,566
# El Dorado, El Dorado

12
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:28,528
# El Dora-a-a-a-do #

13
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:41,846
Today, we sail
to conquer the New Worid.

14
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:46,600
For Spain, for glory, for gold!

15
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,323
Viva Cortes!

16
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:56,046
Altivo, eyes forward.

17
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,687
- Seven!
- All right!

18
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:04,528
- Yes!
- Partner! Hee-hee!

19
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:08,358
- # Tons of gold for you!
- # Tons of gold for me! Hey!

20
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:10,878
# Tons of gold for we! Hey! #

21
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,285
One more roll!

22
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:15,525
Uh, guys, you're broke!

23
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,563
- You got nothin' to bet with!
- Oh, yeah? I got this!

24
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,919
- A map?
- A map!

25
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:25,087
A map of the wonders
of the New Worid.

26
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:28,327
Wow! Let's have a look.

27
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,325
Uh, Tulio!

28
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:37,329
- Excuse us, for one moment, please.
- Tulio, look!

29
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,009
El Dorado, the city of gold.

30
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,803
This could be our destiny, our fate.

31
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:47,446
Miguel, if I believed in fate,
I wouldn't need loaded dice.

32
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,845
Not with the face.
No, no, no.

33
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:52,609
No, no, no, no, no!

34
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:55,039
I said one more roll!

35
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,399
My map against your cash.

36
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,247
Hmm?

37
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:03,078
- All right, peewee. You're on!
- Not with those!

38
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:07,567
This time we use my dice.
Got a problem with that?

39
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,124
No.

40
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,923
I'm going to kill you.

41
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,885
Come on, baby.
Papa needs that crappy map.

42
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,360
Stop that!

43
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:30,527
Show me seven!

44
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,285
- Seven!
- All right!

45
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,286
Seven!

46
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,925
There it is!
Nice doing business with you!

47
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,688
I knew it!

48
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,522
Your dice are loaded!

49
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:02,169
What? You gave me loaded dice?!

50
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:09,086
He gave me loaded dice!

51
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:13,885
- Guard, arrest him!
- You dare to impugn my honour?

52
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:19,243
He was the one who was cheating!
Arrest him! He tricked these sailors!

53
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,326
- Now I'm the thief?
- Yes.

54
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,201
Look in the mirror, pal!

55
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,559
You return that money or I'll...

56
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:28,204
- En garde!
- En garde, yourself.

57
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,925
I will give you
the honour of a quick death.

58
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:35,087
But not with that.
I fight fairly. A-ha!

59
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,722
- Well, any last words?
- I'll cut you to ribbons, fool!

60
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,649
Such mediocrity.
Let your sword do the talking.

61
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:48,000
I will. It will be loquacious
to a fault!

62
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,644
- Ha! Take that!
- Ha ha!

63
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,601
Ha ha ha!

64
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:57,246
- You mincing, fencing, twit.
- You fight like my sister!

65
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,929
I fought her, that's a compliment.

66
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,040
- Blackguard!
- Heathen!

67
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,405
Not the face! Not the face!

68
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:12,880
- Ladies and gentlemen, it's a draw.
- Thank you all for coming.

69
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,524
- You've been great. See you soon.
- Adiós!

70
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:20,207
- Congratulations. Very good!
- No, you...

71
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,042
- We should've kept our swords.
- Yeah.

72
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:30,126
I've got a plan.

73
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:33,924
- What is it?
- Er, well... you... pet him...

74
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,564
- Yeah?
- And I'll...

75
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,289
...RUN!

76
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,446
Well, thanks a lot!

77
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,520
There they are!

78
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:57,165
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

79
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,728
Bye! Thank you!

80
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,681
Olé!

81
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,888
Whoa!

82
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,482
Oh!

83
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,847
- I bet we can make that.
- There!

84
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:25,439
- Two pesetas says we can't.
- You're oooon!

85
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:31,159
You lose!

86
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:35,284
Whoa! What's happening?

87
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:40,563
We're both in barrels.
That's the extent of my knowledge.

88
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,445
OK, Miguel, on three,
we jump for the dock.

89
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:57,086
- Good, good. Excellent.
- One, two, THREE...

90
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,405
Th-three!

91
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,647
Three! Ohh!

92
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,521
Three!

93
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:15,162
You ready?
OK. One more. Let's go.

94
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:19,840
One... two... three!

95
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:25,079
- Excuse us.
- We're outta here.

96
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:28,600
- Who ordered the, uh... pickles?
- Yeah.

97
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,289
Cortes!

98
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:40,563
My crew was as carefully chosen
as the disciples of Christ.

99
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:45,126
And I will not tolerate stowaways.

100
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,161
You will be flogged.

101
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:52,238
And when we put into Cuba,
God willing, you'll be flogged more,

102
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:57,842
then enslaved on the plantations
for the rest of your miserable lives.

103
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:02,361
- To the brig.
- All right! Cuba!

104
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,207
- Hah!
- Ugh!

105
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:18,130
Hey, Altivo. Ah-ta-ta, not for you!

106
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:21,003
Half rations - orders from Cortes.

107
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:34,967
So, um, how's the escape plan coming?

108
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,726
All right. All right, wait!

109
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:41,568
- I'm getting something.
- Yeah

110
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,807
OK!

111
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:51,923
Here's the plan -
dead of night, we grab provisions,

112
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,359
hijack one of those longboats,

113
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:59,200
and then we row back to Spain
like there's no mañana!

114
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,286
- Back to Spain?
- Yeah.

115
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,446
- In a rowboat.
- You got it!

116
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:06,607
Great. Th-that's your plan, is it?

117
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:09,608
- That's pretty much it.
- I like it.

118
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:13,006
- So, how do we get on deck?
- Hmm.

119
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:18,329
Dead of night, we grab provisions,
hijack one of those longboats...

120
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:21,442
- Great.
- What's your idea, smart guy?

121
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:25,608
Don't ask me! You've got the plans!

122
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:30,087
Wait, I have an idea.
Uh, c'mon, give me a boost.

123
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:33,725
Hey, Altivo. Altivo!

124
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:38,167
You want a nice apple?
Come and get it.

125
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,849
But you have to do a trick first.

126
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,886
Huh?

127
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:45,160
All you do is find a pry bar.

128
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:50,278
A long piece of iron
with a hooky thing at the end, yeah?

129
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:53,561
- Miguel, you're talking to a HORSE!
- Shh!

130
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,408
That's it, Altivo, find the pry bar.

131
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:59,123
Yes, the pry bar.

132
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:02,162
He can't understand "pry bar"!

133
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:05,008
He's a dumb horse, there's no way...

134
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:12,485
Well, it's NOT a pry bar.

135
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:31,289
Oh, Altivo.
Oh, thank you, old boy.

136
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:35,209
Listen, if we can
ever return the favour...

137
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:39,084
For Pete's sake,
he's a warhorse, not a poodle.

138
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:42,600
- C'mon before he licks you to death.
- Adiós.

139
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,723
- Shh, quiet.
- What's the matter?

140
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,362
He wants his apple.

141
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:54,482
Give it to him
before he wakes the ship!

142
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,289
- Fetch!
- Huh?

143
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,282
Hmm?

144
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,242
Huh?

145
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,967
- Altivo!
- Huh? Miguel!

146
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,480
- Altivo, coming!
- Miguel!

147
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,805
Hang on! I'm here, old boy!

148
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,444
- Have you lost your mind?
- I'm coming!

149
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,845
Oh!

150
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,767
Ho-o-ly ship!

151
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,721
Whoa!

152
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,886
- Loop the rope under the horse!
- Yes!

153
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:52,523
On three, pull back on the rope!

154
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:54,447
- What?
- Three!

155
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,401
Pull!

156
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,682
Tulio! Hey, it worked!

157
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,403
Did any of the supplies make it?

158
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:16,163
Well... yes and no.

159
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,767
Ohhh, great!

160
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:25,359
Be positive.
At least things can't get wor...

161
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:28,641
Excuse me.
Were you going to say "worse"?

162
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,322
- No.
- You sure?

163
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,407
Absolutely,
I've revised that whole thing.

164
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:37,921
- We're at least in a rowboat.
- Exactly. You miss nothing.

165
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,041
Whoaaaa!

166
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:34,204
Tulio, did you ever imagine
it would end like this?

167
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,445
The horse is a surprise.

168
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:41,199
Any... regrets?

169
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,845
Besides dying? Yeah.

170
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,803
I never... had enough...

171
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:51,000
...gold.

172
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:56,124
My regret, besides dying, is...

173
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,879
our greatest adventure
is over before it began

174
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:03,286
and no one will even remember us.

175
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:06,959
Well, if it's
any consolation, Miguel,

176
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:10,286
you... made my life...

177
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:12,446
... an adventure.

178
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,766
And if it's any consolation, Tulio...

179
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:19,809
...you made my life... rich.

180
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,280
- Is it?
- Hmm.

181
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,446
- It is! It's...
- It's...

182
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,606
It's land!

183
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,723
All in favour of the boat say "aye."

184
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,079
- Aye!
- Aye! Go!

185
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:14,884
Hey, Miguel!
I could use a little help!

186
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,405
Miguel! Hello!

187
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:20,088
Tulio! We've done it!

188
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:23,918
- What's that? The map?
- It's all right here!

189
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:26,404
You still have the map?

190
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:28,406
Whistling rock! The stream!

191
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:32,602
- You kept the map but no food?
- Even those mountains.

192
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:36,928
You said so yourself -
it could be possible. And it is!

193
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:40,889
It really is the map to El Dorado!

194
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:45,802
- You drank the seawater.
- Oh, come on!

195
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:51,243
I'm not coming on! I wouldn't enter
that jungle for a million pesetas!

196
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:55,363
- How about a hundred million?
- What?

197
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:59,961
- Since El Dorado's the city of gold.
- What's your point?

198
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:04,959
Dust, nuggets, a temple
where you pluck gold from the walls.

199
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:08,320
But you won't go,
so let's get into the boat

200
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:11,601
and row back to Spain -
it worked last time

201
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:16,360
Wait! Mmm. Wait a minute. New plan.

202
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:20,608
We find the city of gold,
we take the gold...

203
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:24,325
- THEN we go back to Spain.
- And buy Spain! Yeah!

204
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,962
That's the spirit!

205
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:30,925
- Come on! We'll follow that trail!
- What trail?

206
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:34,963
The trail that we blaze!

207
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:41,638
THAT trail that we blaze!

208
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:43,646
Phewee.

209
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,926
Oh, no, you don't.

210
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:51,325
Yeow! Your horse
bit me in the butt!

211
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:59,038
# Look out New Worid here we come

212
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:02,287
- # Brave, intrepid... #
- Charge!

213
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,366
# And then some

214
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:09,686
# Pioneers of maximum audacity

215
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:14,281
# Whose résumés
show that we are just the team

216
00:17:14,330 --> 00:17:16,446
# To live where others
merely dream... #

217
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:21,245
- What are you looking at?
- # Building up our head of steam

218
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,850
# On the trail we blaze

219
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:31,439
# Changing legend into fact

220
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:33,685
# We shall ride into history

221
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:36,608
# Turning myth into truth

222
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:43,522
# We shall surely gaze
on the sweet unfolding

223
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,765
# Of an antique mystery

224
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:48,563
# All will be revealed

225
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:52,444
# On the trail we blaze... #

226
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,845
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

227
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:57,688
# On the trail we blaze #

228
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:00,688
- Dinner is served.
- Hello.

229
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:04,848
# Paradise is close at hand

230
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,563
# Shangri-La

231
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:11,444
# The promised land

232
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,721
# Seventh heaven on demand

233
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:17,000
# Quite unusual nowadays

234
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:20,008
# Virgin vistas undefiled

235
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:23,247
# Minds and bodies running wild

236
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:26,248
# In the man behold a child

237
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,520
# On the trail we blaze

238
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,845
# On the trail we blaze

239
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:36,802
# The trail we blaze

240
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,920
# Is road uncharted

241
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:44,647
# Through terra incognita
to a golden shrine

242
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,841
# No place for the traveller

243
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:51,485
# To be fainthearted

244
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:56,206
# We are part
of a sumptuous grand design

245
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,923
# Changing legend into fact

246
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:02,280
# We shall ride into history

247
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,560
# Turning myth into truth

248
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:07,727
# We shall surely gaze

249
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:10,842
# On the sweet unfolding

250
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,927
# Of an antique mystery

251
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:16,245
# All will be revealed... #

252
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,606
# On the trail we blaze #

253
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:55,161
Hmm.

254
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:01,679
Miguel. Miguel, wake up. We're there.

255
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:04,244
- We found it?
- Oh, we found it.

256
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,929
- Fantastic! How far?
- Here.

257
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:10,360
- Where? Behind the rock?
- No, no. This is it.

258
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:13,726
Give me that! This ca... What?

259
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:17,126
Apparently, "El Dorado"
is native for...

260
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:20,407
..."great, big ROCK"!

261
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:24,159
ROCK-ROCK-ROCK...

262
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:29,000
Tell you what, I'm feeling generous,
so YOU can have MY share.

263
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:32,326
You don't think Cortes
beat us here and...

264
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:35,726
And what? Took all
the really big rocks? Scoundrel!

265
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,886
We have to think about this.

266
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:43,687
- We've come all this way, and we...
- Get on the horse!

267
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:50,601
No, no, not with the face. Stop.

268
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:54,723
Looks like
a pass right over there.

269
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:56,920
Oh!

270
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,888
Oh!

271
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,159
Hyah!

272
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:29,006
Heh. I've...

273
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:31,684
Uh, hello. This your rock?

274
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:35,564
Sorry, just looking.
We're, um... tourists!

275
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:39,279
We lost our group. May we go now?

276
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:42,648
- Ah!
- Heh-heh. Spears.

277
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:58,160
Hey! Hey!

278
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:58,721
Oh, my...

279
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,207
It's-It's...

280
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,844
El Dorado!

281
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:36,927
Oh!

282
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:13,565
Mmm. Ah!

283
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:25,202
Well, it was nice
working with you, partner.

284
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:29,528
Tulio... I'm sorry about
that girl in Barcelona.

285
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:32,368
- So, you... You...
- Behold!

286
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:34,799
As the prophecies foretold,

287
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:38,365
the time of judgement is now!

288
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:48,440
Citizens! Did I not predict
that the gods would come to us?

289
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,442
Hmm.

290
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:55,846
My lords, I am Tzekel-Kan,

291
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:59,644
your devoted high priest,
speaker for the gods.

292
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:01,965
Hey.

293
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:06,288
I am Chief Tannabok.
What names may we call you?

294
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:10,006
Hm? I am Miguel.

295
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,280
And I am Tulio.

296
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:15,764
And they call us Miguel and Tulio!

297
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:21,203
Your arrival has greatly anticipated.
My lords, how long will you stay?

298
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:26,119
Aha! You've captured this thief.

299
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:29,401
- How would you punish her?
- Oh, no, no, no!

300
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:31,486
My lord, I am not a thief.

301
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:37,526
See, the gods sent me a vision
to bring tribute to guide them here.

302
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:42,041
My only wish is to serve the gods.

303
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:49,684
Release her, don't ya think?

304
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:55,965
Then you will begin by returning this
to its rightful place.

305
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:01,406
My lords, why now
do you choose to visit us?

306
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:04,408
Enough! You do not question the gods!

307
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,964
That's right, do not question us,

308
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:11,606
or we shall have to unleash
our awesome and terrible power!

309
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:13,641
And you don't want that!

310
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,248
Well, yes! We do!

311
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:18,362
- You do?
- Of course we do.

312
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:23,279
Visit your wrath upon this
non-believer. Prove your divinity!

313
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,844
Divinity! One moment.

314
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:33,442
You know that voice that tells
people to quit when they're ahead?

315
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:34,969
You don't have one!

316
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,399
- I got carried away!
- Way away!

317
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:41,966
- Maybe we should tell the truth.
- We'd be butchered alive!

318
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:45,798
They're suspicious.
We need a mega-cosmic event...

319
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:51,758
I'm trying. These distractions!

320
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:54,802
- You, horse...
- Think-think-think.

321
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:57,284
I'm on the verge of... STOP!

322
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:59,719
STOP-STOP-STOP...

323
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:29,289
Don't make me start it up again,
cos I will.

324
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:37,122
Oh, mighty lords!

325
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,923
Come. Let me show you to your temple.

326
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:42,040
All right! Temple.

327
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,321
Step aside.

328
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:32,846
To commemorate your arrival, I
propose a reverent ceremony at dawn.

329
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:38,522
Ah, then perhaps I could prepare
a glorious feast for you tonight.

330
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:41,164
Which would you prefer?

331
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:44,407
- Both?
- Both.

332
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:46,406
Both is good.

333
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:49,965
- My lords.
- My lords.

334
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:56,365
And so dawns the Age of the Jaguar.

335
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,279
Happy New Year.

336
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:08,765
- Hey!
- Hey hey.

337
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:18,680
Tulio. Tulio, they actually
think we're gods.

338
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:21,887
It's an entire city
of suckers!

339
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:27,763
We'll just keep it up long enough
to get the gold and get the hell out!

340
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:30,324
Tulio, we'll live like kings!

341
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:33,009
- Miguel and Tulio!
- Tulio and Miguel!

342
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:35,883
- Mighty and powerful gods.
- Hello.

343
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,567
Ahhh!

344
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:44,485
Depart, mortal, before we
strike you with a lightning bolt.

345
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:49,088
Beware the wrath
of the gods! Be gone!

346
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:52,167
Save it for the high priest.
You're gonna need it.

347
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:54,770
Miguel, it's not working.

348
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:56,926
Miguel! We've been caught.

349
00:29:57,010 --> 00:30:02,164
Oh, don't worry about me, boys.
"My only wish is to serve the gods."

350
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:04,929
- Remember?
- How?

351
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:08,883
You guys want the gold
but not to get caught, right?

352
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:12,764
- You'll need my help.
- What makes you think so?

353
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:15,641
Are you serious?

354
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:20,889
I... What... We... OK.

355
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:24,639
- So, uh, who are you?
- Yeah, what's your angle?

356
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:28,365
- No angle. I want in.
- In?

357
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:30,401
On the scam.

358
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:34,400
There's no scam!
Why would you think... Why?

359
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:36,441
So I can get out.

360
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:41,006
- I thought she wanted in?
- She wants in so she can get out.

361
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:44,838
Aha! Got it... Why?

362
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:49,600
Think only you dream of
better things? Of adventure?

363
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:53,245
You've got your reasons
and I've got mine.

364
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:55,804
Let's not make it personal, OK?

365
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:59,126
- It's just business.
- Oh.

366
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:02,321
So when you guys
are ready to go back to...

367
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:05,840
wherever you came from,
I'm going with you.

368
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:10,805
No, don't think so.

369
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:13,410
All right. Fine.

370
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:18,649
I'm sure you know proper rituals,
the holiest days on the calendar,

371
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:22,649
oh, and of course you know
all about Xibalba.

372
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:25,523
OK? Good luck.

373
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:29,486
See you at the execution.

374
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:33,600
Wait! Hold it.

375
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:40,643
- Deal?
- Hmm.

376
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:44,319
- Deal.
- Not yet! Let's see if it works out.

377
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:48,488
Uh-huh. Well, then I suppose
you'll want these back?

378
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:53,403
- How'd you get those?
- Where was she keeping them?

379
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:59,082
- Call me, Chel, your new partner.
- Uh, that's partner-in-training.

380
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:00,882
Now, put these on.

381
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:03,165
Your public's waiting.

382
00:32:03,810 --> 00:32:06,324
Do you mind?

383
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:08,167
No.

384
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:12,249
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Right. Uh, excuse me.

385
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:15,368
Bye.

386
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:21,565
Mm-mm! Maybe they should call
this place "Chel Dorado."

387
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:23,726
She's whoo...

388
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:26,330
- Whoa, she's trouble!
- What?

389
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:31,398
The little voice - remember it?
For a second imagine you have one.

390
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,089
What would it be saying about Chel?

391
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:39,163
No... listen. We are partners.

392
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:41,963
- Partners.
- We have a plan, remember?

393
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:46,765
- Get the gold. Go back to Spain.
- Yes! And we're playing gods.

394
00:32:46,810 --> 00:32:49,643
Now, put Chel in. Hear the voice?

395
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:51,760
Listen carefully.

396
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:56,281
Chel is off-limits, hmm?

397
00:32:56,330 --> 00:33:00,323
Bravo! Chel is off-limits!
Shake on it.

398
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:03,123
- Off-limits. Mm, mm.
- Mmm.

399
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:07,561
Besides, we're supposed to be gods.
We must avoid temptation.

400
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:11,967
Gods. Oh. This is
gonna be tougher than I thought.

401
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:17,801
Tulio, relax! All you have to do is
smile, act godly and follow my lead.

402
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:23,567
Big smile. Like you mean it.

403
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:25,601
A- one, two, three.

404
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:33,844
# I hardly think I'm qualified

405
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:36,802
# To come across all sanctified

406
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:40,445
# I just don't cut it
with the cherubim... #

407
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:43,050
- Ow!
- What're you talking about?

408
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:45,968
# There again they're on their knees

409
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:48,570
# Being worshipped is a breeze

410
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:52,523
# Which rather suits us
in the interim

411
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:55,209
# Interim, interim, it's me and him

412
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:58,367
# Oh, my God! It's tough to be a god

413
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:02,244
# Tread where mortals have not trod

414
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:08,445
# Be deified
when really you're a sham

415
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:10,720
# Be an object of devotion

416
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:14,319
# Be the subject of psalms

417
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:17,203
# It's a rather touching notion

418
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:20,401
# All those prayers and those salaams

419
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:23,567
# And who am I to bridle

420
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:25,999
# If I'm forced to be an idol

421
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:29,122
# If they say that I'm a god

422
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:31,320
# That's what I am

423
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:34,601
# What's more if we don't comply

424
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:36,641
# With the locals' wishes

425
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:41,684
# I can see us being
sacrificed or stuffed! #

426
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,448
You have a point there.

427
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:46,687
# So let's be gods,
the perks are great

428
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:49,608
- # El Dorado on our plates... #
- Thank you.

429
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:53,120
# Local feelings
should not be rebuffed

430
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:55,638
# I never rebuff a local feeling

431
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:57,362
# No, my friend

432
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:59,446
# It's tough to be a god

433
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:02,800
# But if you get the people's nod

434
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,364
# Count your blessings,
keep 'em sweet

435
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:09,005
- # That's our advice! #
- It's great advice!

436
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:12,008
# Be a symbol of perfection

437
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:15,087
# Be a legend, be a cult

438
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:17,724
# Take their praise,
take a collection

439
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:20,608
# As the multitudes exalt

440
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:23,767
# Don a supernatural habit

441
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:26,927
- # We'd be crazy not to grab it... #
- You got it!

442
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:31,885
# So sign on two new gods
for paradise

443
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:35,969
# Par-a-dise... #

444
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:05,249
- Ahh!
- Good morning, my lords!

445
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:09,044
- He's back!
- Oh, no.

446
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:14,240
And now it's my turn!

447
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:21,925
The gods have awakened!

448
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:24,328
Whoa! Ooh.

449
00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:26,201
Mm-hmm.

450
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:35,006
Thank you.

451
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:37,610
This city is given a great blessing!

452
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:42,201
And what have we done
to show our gratitude?

453
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:45,447
A meagre celebration.

454
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:49,722
The gods deserve a proper tribute!

455
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:58,086
The beginning of a new era,
the dawning of a new age...

456
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:01,048
demands...

457
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:03,439
sacrifice!

458
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:12,802
- I don't like this.
- We must do something.

459
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:24,084
STOP!

460
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:26,280
Hmm?

461
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:30,724
This is not a proper tribute!

462
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:34,729
- You do not want the tribute?
- No, we want tribute.

463
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:38,479
Uh, it's just that, um...
Tulio, tell him.

464
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:44,609
The stars are not in position
for this tribute!

465
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:47,250
Like he says, the stars...

466
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:49,281
Can't do it.

467
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:50,888
Not today.

468
00:37:55,290 --> 00:37:59,806
Ah. Perhaps it is possible
I misread... the heavens.

469
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:03,923
Don't worry about it.
To err is human, to forgive...

470
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:08,600
My lords, may the people of El Dorado
offer you our tribute.

471
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:17,569
Ooohhh.

472
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:21,643
My lords, does this please you?

473
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:26,319
- Very nice. Certainly acceptable.
- It'll do.

474
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:29,043
The gods have chosen!

475
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:31,046
To Xibalba?

476
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:33,968
- Xibalba!
- No, no!

477
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:36,365
To Xibalba!

478
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:38,241
Oh, great.

479
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:55,127
Hey, Chel, um,
what are they doing?

480
00:38:55,170 --> 00:39:00,039
They're sending it to Xibalba,
the spirit worid.

481
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:03,719
- The spirit worid.
- I'll take care of it.

482
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:09,640
Um, excuse me, Chief?
The gods have changed their minds.

483
00:39:12,010 --> 00:39:16,686
They wish to bask in the reverence
that has been shown them.

484
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:19,039
STOP!

485
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:25,399
They wish to bask!

486
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:28,562
Take the tribute to the gods' temple!

487
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:33,246
Nice going.

488
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:44,920
Smile while you can.

489
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:57,008
Well, well, well.

490
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:01,484
What have we here?

491
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:06,278
# Tons of gold for you, hah!

492
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:09,879
- # Tons of gold for me!
- # Tons of gold for we! #

493
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:12,808
- Not bad for a day's work.
- Not at all.

494
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:16,320
We just became richer
than the king of Spain.

495
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:21,763
Speaking of kings, the chief and
high priest seem a bit, uh, tense.

496
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:23,881
Buenos días!

497
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:26,205
Listen, all we have to do

498
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:30,249
is keep playing
the one against the other.

499
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:33,362
Do a god dance,
chant some mumbo jumbo,

500
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:35,924
then get the hell back to Spain!

501
00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:40,760
Um, Tulio, how are we gonna
get all this back to Spain?

502
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:42,846
Ummm...

503
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:45,482
- A boat?
- Yeah.

504
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:50,843
We really hate to be ascending so
soon but urgent business has come up.

505
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:53,120
- Family matters...
- Family.

506
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:55,081
Badda-bing... You know.

507
00:40:55,130 --> 00:41:00,921
Oh, we expected you to be staying
for the next... thousand years.

508
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:03,165
As we say in the spirit worid,

509
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:06,520
there's your plan
and then the gods' plan.

510
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:08,561
Our plan calls for a boat,

511
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:12,159
cos we'll ascend in a
kinda horizontal pattern first.

512
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:15,885
Then we'll go vertical
further out to sea.

513
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:19,002
To build a boat
large and glorious enough

514
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:21,689
would take about a week.

515
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,846
- A week?
- Um...

516
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:27,326
I wonder how long
it would take Tzekel-Kan.

517
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:31,045
B- But for the gods... three days.

518
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:32,967
Uh...

519
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:35,689
Well, if that's the best you can do.

520
00:41:35,770 --> 00:41:39,809
Oh, if you were not burdened
with so MUCH tribute,

521
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:41,727
you could leave sooner.

522
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:44,523
- Hmm?
- Hmm? I like it here. Miguel?

523
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:47,562
Yep, yep. Three days is just fine.

524
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:49,999
No, three days is not fine.

525
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:52,848
- This is a real...
- Mmm.

526
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:56,007
- These. These are the ones.
- Thank you.

527
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:57,688
Problem.

528
00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:00,722
Miguel, how are we gonna
keep this up?

529
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:02,681
You worry too much.

530
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:08,009
No, I worry exactly the right amount.
You can never worry too much.

531
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:10,723
We just have to lie low.

532
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:16,003
But, Tulio, this place is amazing!
I mean, I wonder what's...

533
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:18,405
No! Don't even move!

534
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:20,281
- Tulio.
- You're moving!

535
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:22,127
- A little, but -
- Hey!

536
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:24,206
- C'mon.
- Bup-bup. Stay!

537
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:28,721
- I just...
- Just stand there!

538
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:32,319
For three days?

539
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:34,600
Yes! Exactly.

540
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:38,359
Three days.
Don't even breathe. All right?

541
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,521
All right. We lie low.

542
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:43,561
Nah, ah, ah, ah. Promise?

543
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:45,487
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

544
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:48,840
Great! Good. OK.

545
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:53,162
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to gloat over my gold.

546
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:59,200
Oh, yum, yum, yum.

547
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:04,568
- It's beautiful, isn't it?
- Yeah!

548
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:07,841
- You really shouldn't miss it.
- I know.

549
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:10,125
But l-I couldn't.

550
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:13,003
Go ahead. I'll cover for you.

551
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:15,245
Oh, good. Thanks.

552
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:20,127
- What happened to Altivo?
- I don't know.

553
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:22,843
# Tulio goes for paradise #

554
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:26,246
- Hey, what happened to Miguel?
- I don't know.

555
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:27,888
Oh, my God!

556
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:32,367
He's gone! Miguel's gone!
He's loose! What am I gonna do?

557
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:35,607
Oh, no, no!

558
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:39,120
Oh, Miguel is right.
You worry too much.

559
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:44,008
Oh. Ooh.

560
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:46,843
Oh, yeah. Oh, down, down, down.

561
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:51,043
No! No! Big trouble.

562
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:53,564
Whoa!

563
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:56,647
Look, sweetheart,
we're in a con here,

564
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:58,965
walking the razor's edge.

565
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:01,285
On the one hand, gold!

566
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:05,807
On the other hand,
painful, agonising failure!

567
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:09,809
Ahem. I can't afford
any tempta... distractions.

568
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:13,007
So, I'm sorry.
SO sorry.

569
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:16,645
But perhaps another time?

570
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:19,921
Too bad. I'm free now.

571
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,999
I'm... not really sure I trust you.

572
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:27,928
I'm not really
asking you to trust me.

573
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:31,042
- Am I?
- Whoo.

574
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:33,684
OK.

575
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:36,722
Ooh, yeah.

576
00:44:58,330 --> 00:45:00,685
Excuse me. Excuse me?

577
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:04,443
Hey, where is everybody?

578
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:09,883
They've been cleared so the city
can be cleansed, as you ordered.

579
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:11,966
- Cleansed?
- Yes.

580
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:15,889
So the Age of the Jaguar
can begin, as you ordered.

581
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:19,127
- Get back in!
- Hey, stop that!

582
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:21,001
- Move!
- Stop!

583
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:23,245
What are you doing? Stop that!

584
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:28,159
But those who disobey your orders
are punished, as you ordered.

585
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:31,247
Seems I've been giving
a lot of orders.

586
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:35,966
- Tzekel-Kan has told your commands.
- Really?

587
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:39,286
- Here's an order. Take the day off.
- Huh?

588
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:43,760
Are you all right?

589
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:45,607
Here.

590
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:50,767
Oh, no!
It's all right. Please.

591
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:06,846
Hey, Altivo. There you are.

592
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:13,887
Oh.

593
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:31,049
# The more I learn

594
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:33,843
# The more I see

595
00:46:35,570 --> 00:46:40,086
# The less the worid impassions me

596
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:44,486
# The hungry heart

597
00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:47,566
# The roving eye

598
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:51,039
# Have come to rest

599
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:53,206
# Do not apply

600
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:58,086
# The frantic chase

601
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:02,048
# The crazy ride

602
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:05,799
# The thrill has gone

603
00:47:05,850 --> 00:47:08,887
# I step aside

604
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:12,240
# I'd believe in anything

605
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,560
# Were it not for you

606
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:19,166
# Showing me by just existing

607
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:22,168
# Only this is true

608
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:24,405
# I love you

609
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:28,489
# I love you

610
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:31,249
# Without question

611
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:32,928
# I love you

612
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:36,280
# I'd believe in anything

613
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:38,161
# Were it not for you

614
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:45,202
# Showing me by just existing
only this is true

615
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:48,686
# Oh, I love you #

616
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:17,758
Hmm. This is not what I expected.

617
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:21,364
Perhaps Lord Tulio will enlighten me.

618
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:29,008
- How do I look?
- Oh, uh... Well, you...

619
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:30,483
Oh, shut up.

620
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,600
Oh! Whoa!

621
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:36,926
My lord? Hello?

622
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:38,801
- The high priest.
- Ow!

623
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:42,445
What'll he think if he
finds a god here with me?

624
00:48:42,490 --> 00:48:44,401
Uh, lucky god?

625
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:46,805
Just-just-just...

626
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:48,681
- Hello?
- Whoa!

627
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:53,808
Oh, Tzekel-Kan! What brings you here?

628
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:57,923
L- l-I humbly request
an audience with you, my lord.

629
00:48:57,970 --> 00:48:59,801
Lord yes, what can I do?

630
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:03,160
I've seen Lord Miguel
out among the people.

631
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:04,609
Really?

632
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,244
If I may offer some advice?

633
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:09,758
- All right. Shoot.
- Ahem.

634
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:14,281
- My lord, you are perfect.
- Oh, well. Go on.

635
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:19,358
But in your perfection, you cannot
know how imperfect humans are.

636
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:24,404
Like snakes they are.
Spineless and slippery.

637
00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:30,525
They are as untrustworthy as rats -
stealing, cheating, with no remorse.

638
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:34,768
Spinning webs of lies, like spiders!

639
00:49:34,810 --> 00:49:37,449
Stop it! That's disgusting.

640
00:49:37,490 --> 00:49:42,006
- They're beyond disgusting!
- Yeah, yeah, way beyond.

641
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:45,645
Then we agree.
I'll begin the preparations.

642
00:49:45,690 --> 00:49:50,206
Now, your victims -
bound to an altar or free-range?

643
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:51,444
Sheez.

644
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:55,642
Will you devour their essence whole
or piece by piece?

645
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:58,079
Tzek, you've lost me.

646
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:02,009
My lord, they won't respect you
without fearing you.

647
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:04,439
We'll make them fear us by...

648
00:50:04,490 --> 00:50:07,004
A sacrifice, as is prophesised.

649
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:09,928
The history will be written in...

650
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:12,768
- Ink?
- Blood!

651
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:15,449
Of course! I should tell Lord Miguel.

652
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:22,686
I should discuss the entire, uh,
blood issue right away.

653
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:25,568
Excuse us, won't you?

654
00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:29,728
Finally... we're connecting.

655
00:50:39,690 --> 00:50:41,521
This way.

656
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:49,248
Ooh.

657
00:50:49,290 --> 00:50:53,363
- What do you think you're doing?
- Lying low.

658
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:55,878
Look, change of plans.

659
00:50:55,930 --> 00:51:00,003
- We have to grab what we can and go.
- What? Why?

660
00:51:00,050 --> 00:51:02,245
Cos the high priest is nuts!

661
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:04,724
- This is unacceptable!
- Yeah.

662
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:08,126
The gods should not
be playing ball like this!

663
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:12,721
- Well, exactly!
- This is how gods should play ball!

664
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:19,048
- Well, don't blame me.
- I blame you.

665
00:51:20,730 --> 00:51:26,202
- What is the object of this game?
- Knock the ball through the hoop.

666
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:28,206
- What hoop?
- That hoop.

667
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:33,119
- That's impossible! We'll lose!
- Gods don't lose.

668
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,841
Heep-ha!

669
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:42,769
The Chief's warriors,
finest players in the city.

670
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:46,723
15 mere mortals against two gods.

671
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:52,648
It's uneven but I hope they
challenge you enough to make it...

672
00:51:52,690 --> 00:51:54,328
interesting.

673
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:56,679
Play ball!

674
00:51:59,330 --> 00:52:03,721
- Crush them into the dust. Enjoy!
- Go! Go! Go!

675
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:12,206
Ahh!

676
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:14,923
D'oh. D'oh.

677
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:22,367
My lords, were you not supposed
to put the ball into play?

678
00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:26,039
Oh! Ha. Well, no, no, no, no, no...

679
00:52:26,090 --> 00:52:29,446
We were demonstrating
the traditional...

680
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:31,720
first avoidance manoeuvre.

681
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:36,446
Ah. I've never heard
of such a thing.

682
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:41,723
Excuse me. Who invented this game?

683
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:46,048
Why, the gods! Of course!

684
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:49,366
I'm warning you,
don't push your luck.

685
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:53,119
But, Tulio, we're the gods.

686
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:00,600
Tulio! The hip! The hip!

687
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:07,365
This is impossible.

688
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:10,123
Yaaa!

689
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:12,764
Excuse me?

690
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:15,165
Heep... haaa!

691
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:20,048
Heep-ha! Heep-ha!

692
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:31,445
Foul! That was a foul!

693
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:35,765
Ah!

694
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:39,166
New ball!

695
00:53:41,090 --> 00:53:46,084
- How long does this go on?
- Until the shadow touches this line.

696
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:49,202
- We need a miracle.
- No, we need to cheat.

697
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:07,483
Yes!

698
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:12,520
- Huh?
- Ooh!

699
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:14,648
Hey!

700
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:17,158
Whoo-hoo!

701
00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:21,325
Olé!

702
00:54:27,970 --> 00:54:29,005
Huh?

703
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:31,449
Hmm.

704
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:33,929
Yes!

705
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:36,165
- Who's the god?
- You da god.

706
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:38,929
- No, you the god.
- You da god. Fine.

707
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:41,086
Yeah! Yeah!

708
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:53,808
Guys, it's here! It's here with me!

709
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:25,559
I love this game!

710
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:28,448
Yes!

711
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:31,129
- Yes! Woo!
- Well done, partner.

712
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:34,606
- Yes! Yes!
- My lords, congratulations.

713
00:55:34,690 --> 00:55:37,682
Now, you will wish to have
the losing team...

714
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:40,119
...sacrificed to your glory.

715
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:45,799
- Not again. Look, Tzekel-Kan!
- Uh, Miguel?

716
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:48,648
- Forget the sacrifices.
- Miguel.

717
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:51,290
We don't want any sacrifices.

718
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:55,926
Sacred writings say you'll
devour the wicked and unrighteous.

719
00:55:55,970 --> 00:55:58,723
No one here fits that description.

720
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:06,199
As speaker for the gods, it would be
my privilege to point them out.

721
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:09,003
The gods speak for themselves now!

722
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:13,521
This city and these people
have no need for you any more!

723
00:56:15,890 --> 00:56:18,484
There will be no sacrifices!

724
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:21,840
Not now, not ever!

725
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:24,761
Now get out!

726
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:29,523
Oh!

727
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:40,607
Mmm. As the...

728
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:44,199
gods... command.

729
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:48,239
Whoa! Who-o-oa!

730
00:56:48,290 --> 00:56:51,680
Hey, not bad for
my first commandment, huh?

731
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:56,008
Miguel, the little voice...
Yeah, fine.

732
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:02,646
Do you know why
the gods demand blood?

733
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:05,045
I don't know.

734
00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:08,560
Because gods don't bleed.

735
00:57:11,810 --> 00:57:15,405
It's time to take the future
into my own hands,

736
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:17,924
and this city will be cleansed.

737
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:20,478
Even if I have to do it myself.

738
00:57:20,530 --> 00:57:22,521
Uh, how?

739
00:57:22,850 --> 00:57:26,525
There are dark magics here...

740
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:29,038
and power... and...

741
00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:31,923
Ooh. My, my, my, my, my.

742
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:35,849
It's not called
the Age of the Jaguar for nothing.

743
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:44,324
This will be a delightful way
to bid the false gods... goodbye.

744
00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:58,441
Hmm.

745
00:57:58,490 --> 00:58:00,640
Adiós, muchacho!

746
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:11,288
Mmm!

747
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:19,086
- Well, it's, um, uh, nice.
- Nice?

748
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:20,848
- Yes, nice.
- But?

749
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:25,327
Um, but, uh,
is it really fit for the gods?

750
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:26,883
My lord.

751
00:58:26,930 --> 00:58:30,809
I have been around boats, believe me,

752
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:36,368
and that, um, the pointy, tall, um,
the-the long up and down thing...

753
00:58:36,450 --> 00:58:39,522
- The mast?
- Mast, yes. Mast is good.

754
00:58:39,610 --> 00:58:45,048
Well, look at it. There's not
nearly enough, uh... rope.

755
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:48,048
- Rope?
- Yes, rope. Exactly my point.

756
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:51,924
Vertical ascension requires
a lot more... rope.

757
00:58:51,970 --> 00:58:55,963
- My lord.
- And look at this.

758
00:58:56,010 --> 00:58:59,241
This doesn't look at all secure.

759
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:04,318
Chief, I'm sorry, but
all in all, it is a complete do-over.

760
00:59:08,490 --> 00:59:10,003
Hmm.

761
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:14,280
You know, Lord Miguel,

762
00:59:14,330 --> 00:59:16,764
if you wish to stay,

763
00:59:16,850 --> 00:59:19,045
you only need to say so.

764
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:22,319
You mean... forever?

765
00:59:22,370 --> 00:59:23,928
Of course.

766
00:59:27,770 --> 00:59:32,685
Oh, no, I can't. I have to go back
with Tulio. We're... partners.

767
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:36,284
Big plans in the other worid, huh?

768
00:59:37,690 --> 00:59:39,840
Yep. Big plans.

769
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:44,281
Well, then, I'd better
go get some more rope, huh?

770
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:47,288
Oh, Chief, um,
forget about the rope.

771
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:49,082
Um, my mistake.

772
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:52,247
Hey, to err is human.

773
01:00:04,610 --> 01:00:06,123
HALF?

774
01:00:08,130 --> 01:00:10,769
Ha ha. I don't think so.

775
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:14,644
Tell you what.
I'll let you come back to Spain,

776
01:00:14,690 --> 01:00:20,481
like you wanted, and, yeah, I can see
throwing you, mmm, ten per cent?

777
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:24,523
You know, maybe I won't go
to Spain and take a third.

778
01:00:24,610 --> 01:00:28,046
Ohh! Like you
don't wanna go to Spain.

779
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:31,844
Oh, like you don't want me
to want to go to Spain.

780
01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:34,643
- I want you to want...
- Hmm?

781
01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:38,524
- What you want.
- Mm-hmm. Go on.

782
01:00:38,610 --> 01:00:42,125
All right. Cards on the table.

783
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:45,845
Uh, I want you to come to Spain
with me and Miguel.

784
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:48,245
Mostly me. Especially me.

785
01:00:48,290 --> 01:00:50,281
Only me. Forget Miguel.

786
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:54,881
Well... as long as
that's what you want.

787
01:00:55,850 --> 01:00:58,364
- Me too.
- OK.

788
01:00:58,450 --> 01:01:00,759
Deal?

789
01:01:00,810 --> 01:01:03,722
Deal. Mmm.

790
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:13,767
"Forget Miguel"? Well, forget Tulio.

791
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:32,689
Well, is it ready yet?

792
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:40,161
Ooh.

793
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:43,561
Ah!

794
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:46,849
Ahh! Hmm.

795
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:49,882
It seems to be missing something.

796
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:53,121
Ah, that's it.

797
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:57,242
It needs more... body.

798
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:23,123
Ah!

799
01:02:24,130 --> 01:02:25,848
Ah!

800
01:02:28,730 --> 01:02:33,087
Do... as I command!

801
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:43,645
- The gods deserve a proper tribute.
- Stop! There will be no sacrifices!

802
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:47,524
Ha ha! That kid does you
better than you do.

803
01:02:47,570 --> 01:02:50,004
Some send-off, huh?

804
01:02:50,050 --> 01:02:53,884
We're at the "go back and
live like kings" part.

805
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:01,405
Yoo-hoo.

806
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:06,843
Well, isn't king
kind of a step down from god?

807
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:12,084
What? Wh-Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Miguel, we can't stay here.

808
01:03:12,170 --> 01:03:14,126
We have a plan, remember?

809
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:19,608
How about...
we forget the plan? Hmm?

810
01:03:19,650 --> 01:03:22,118
What?

811
01:03:29,330 --> 01:03:34,040
Now everyone will know
the truth of your "divinity"!

812
01:03:51,490 --> 01:03:53,287
I'm OK!

813
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:55,161
I'm still OK!

814
01:03:55,210 --> 01:03:57,849
Come on! Get on!

815
01:04:03,850 --> 01:04:05,841
Altivo, hyah!

816
01:04:09,010 --> 01:04:10,602
Whoa!

817
01:04:14,370 --> 01:04:16,600
- No!
- ARGH!

818
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:23,521
Tulio!

819
01:04:23,570 --> 01:04:27,802
Hey, over here,
you big Tzekel-Kan cat creep!

820
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:30,760
Altivo, get Chel out of here.

821
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:45,001
Duck!

822
01:04:53,410 --> 01:04:55,366
Who-o-o-oa!

823
01:05:01,850 --> 01:05:03,568
Move! Move!

824
01:05:06,410 --> 01:05:08,844
Jump!

825
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:22,768
Who-o-o-a!

826
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:31,566
I know what you are,
and I know what you are not!

827
01:05:31,650 --> 01:05:34,528
And you are not gods!

828
01:05:37,450 --> 01:05:40,010
Y... You're not a god?

829
01:05:40,050 --> 01:05:41,768
You lied to me?

830
01:05:45,890 --> 01:05:49,326
- How dare you!
- Hey, it was his stupid plan!

831
01:05:49,370 --> 01:05:50,769
- What?
- Oh, oh...

832
01:05:50,810 --> 01:05:54,166
My plan was that we should lie low!

833
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:59,370
But your plan was to run off and be
all "Oh, look at me, I'm a god."

834
01:05:59,410 --> 01:06:03,961
- Not true!
- No? You're buying your own con!

835
01:06:04,010 --> 01:06:05,921
At least I'm not dating mine.

836
01:06:05,970 --> 01:06:10,407
I... Ooh, low blow.
Listen, mister high and mighty.

837
01:06:10,450 --> 01:06:15,399
We'd be sailing with a mountain
of gold if you had listened to me!

838
01:06:15,450 --> 01:06:20,399
Well, you've got the precious gold
and Chel. What do you need me for?

839
01:06:20,450 --> 01:06:23,123
Well, maybe I DON'T need you.

840
01:06:23,170 --> 01:06:28,119
Well, go back to Spain, I'll stay,
and we'll both get what we want!

841
01:06:28,170 --> 01:06:31,287
- That's fine with me, pal!
- Me, too!

842
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:33,082
- Fine!
- OK!

843
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:36,486
All right!

844
01:06:36,530 --> 01:06:38,441
Tie him up!

845
01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:40,446
What?

846
01:06:40,490 --> 01:06:42,481
Whoa.

847
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:46,047
Jump!

848
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:57,439
No-o-o-o-o!

849
01:07:20,850 --> 01:07:22,841
Ah!

850
01:07:26,090 --> 01:07:28,081
My lord.

851
01:07:33,610 --> 01:07:36,602
Where did you get this?

852
01:07:40,170 --> 01:07:44,288
That was good, huh?

853
01:08:03,970 --> 01:08:06,359
Hey, a little help, please?

854
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:09,647
Chief Tanni! Chief Tanni!

855
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:15,209
- I've decided to stay.
- Oh, this is wonderful news!

856
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:17,844
What a glorious day for El Dorado.

857
01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:21,599
Lord Miguel has decided
to live among us!

858
01:08:22,290 --> 01:08:24,121
Tulio!

859
01:08:24,170 --> 01:08:26,161
Is everything OK?

860
01:08:31,210 --> 01:08:34,600
Everything is... fine.

861
01:08:55,970 --> 01:08:57,722
# There isn't much

862
01:08:57,770 --> 01:08:59,806
# I haven't shared

863
01:09:01,010 --> 01:09:04,969
# With you along the road

864
01:09:05,010 --> 01:09:09,401
# And through it all
there'll always be

865
01:09:09,450 --> 01:09:12,328
# Tomorrow's episode

866
01:09:13,410 --> 01:09:17,164
# Suddenly that isn't true

867
01:09:17,210 --> 01:09:21,886
# There's another avenue

868
01:09:21,930 --> 01:09:25,479
# Beckoning the great divide

869
01:09:25,530 --> 01:09:27,919
# Ask no questions

870
01:09:27,970 --> 01:09:30,404
# Take no side

871
01:09:30,450 --> 01:09:34,363
# Who's to say who's right or wrong

872
01:09:34,410 --> 01:09:37,607
# Whose course is braver run

873
01:09:38,690 --> 01:09:42,205
# All I know is all we had

874
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:47,529
# Is over, said and done

875
01:09:51,690 --> 01:09:56,002
# Friends never say goodbye

876
01:10:00,890 --> 01:10:05,168
# Never say goodbye... #

877
01:10:08,570 --> 01:10:10,959
Ha!

878
01:10:18,690 --> 01:10:21,727
Ahhh! Whew!

879
01:10:33,570 --> 01:10:37,006
# Friends never say goodbye... #

880
01:10:39,730 --> 01:10:42,722
- We'll miss you!
- Thank you!

881
01:10:42,770 --> 01:10:46,365
# Never say goodbye #

882
01:10:47,490 --> 01:10:49,321
Eww.

883
01:11:06,610 --> 01:11:10,523
# Friends never say goodbye

884
01:11:13,610 --> 01:11:15,168
# Friends

885
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:19,761
# Never say goodbye... #

886
01:11:21,570 --> 01:11:23,800
Well, good luck.

887
01:11:24,890 --> 01:11:27,279
Yeah. You too.

888
01:11:29,650 --> 01:11:35,805
# Never say goodbye #

889
01:11:47,650 --> 01:11:49,641
Whoa, boy, what is it?

890
01:11:57,330 --> 01:12:00,561
- Cortes.
- My lord, what is it?

891
01:12:00,610 --> 01:12:03,283
Chief Tanni! Chief Tanni!

892
01:12:03,330 --> 01:12:08,085
Approaching the city...
is an army of strangers.

893
01:12:08,130 --> 01:12:12,408
We are safe here. They'll never
find the gate to the city.

894
01:12:12,450 --> 01:12:16,523
But, sire, they are being led
by Tzekel-Kan.

895
01:12:16,570 --> 01:12:20,529
He survived?
Warriors, prepare for battle!

896
01:12:21,850 --> 01:12:24,728
Chief, you cannot fight them!

897
01:12:24,770 --> 01:12:26,840
Then how can we stop them?

898
01:12:26,890 --> 01:12:28,881
We can't.

899
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:37,041
Hmm.

900
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:40,440
Uh, one moment, please!

901
01:12:43,610 --> 01:12:46,841
- OK, here's the gate. And the boat.
- And?

902
01:12:46,890 --> 01:12:49,324
- The gate. The boat.
- And?

903
01:12:49,370 --> 01:12:52,043
- Well, the goat. The bate.
- Tulio!

904
01:12:52,090 --> 01:12:53,523
Ah!

905
01:12:56,890 --> 01:13:01,042
Ah! That's it! We'll
crash the boat into the pillars.

906
01:13:01,090 --> 01:13:04,526
That's it? I mean... But...

907
01:13:04,570 --> 01:13:07,323
- What about the gold?
- Well...

908
01:13:08,610 --> 01:13:10,760
Chief! Ahem...

909
01:13:10,810 --> 01:13:12,846
Chief!

910
01:13:12,890 --> 01:13:14,687
I've got a plan.

911
01:13:24,850 --> 01:13:28,445
Hold the line steady!
They're almost in place!

912
01:13:32,170 --> 01:13:35,958
It better be there, for your sake.

913
01:13:53,090 --> 01:13:56,799
OK, Chief, on my signal!

914
01:13:58,370 --> 01:14:01,168
Ready! Hit the pillars!

915
01:14:01,210 --> 01:14:04,088
Now!

916
01:14:15,330 --> 01:14:19,289
- They're breaking too fast!
- Tulio, the sail!

917
01:14:20,610 --> 01:14:22,805
It's stuck!

918
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:35,447
They're not gonna make it. ALTIVO!

919
01:14:39,690 --> 01:14:41,248
Ah!

920
01:14:45,410 --> 01:14:47,287
Are you crazy?

921
01:14:59,850 --> 01:15:01,408
Aaagh!

922
01:15:03,490 --> 01:15:06,129
Get off! You won't see
the city again!

923
01:15:06,170 --> 01:15:10,049
I know. I'm not gonna
let you have all the fun.

924
01:15:10,090 --> 01:15:13,400
Come on, we've got a wave to catch!

925
01:15:23,330 --> 01:15:25,400
Whoa!

926
01:15:36,090 --> 01:15:38,968
- Get out of the way!
- Huh?

927
01:15:40,410 --> 01:15:42,366
Hold on!

928
01:15:58,650 --> 01:16:01,767
We're gonna have to hit it broadside!

929
01:16:01,810 --> 01:16:04,927
That's your plan? But the gold!

930
01:16:04,970 --> 01:16:10,044
I know! Just turn the boat!

931
01:16:10,130 --> 01:16:13,520
On impact, everybody jump!

932
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:49,807
We made it. It worked.
It worked! Ha ha ha!

933
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:52,609
- Quiet. Get down!
- Ouch. Ow!

934
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:55,323
There they are.

935
01:17:13,490 --> 01:17:14,809
No.

936
01:17:22,450 --> 01:17:26,728
You lying heathen.
There is nothing here at all.

937
01:17:26,770 --> 01:17:29,238
No. Wait. Wait.

938
01:17:31,810 --> 01:17:34,370
- Men, seize him!
- What?

939
01:17:34,410 --> 01:17:39,325
There is no El Dorado here.
Onward, men!

940
01:17:39,370 --> 01:17:40,769
Agh!

941
01:17:47,530 --> 01:17:50,124
Wait! No, wait!

942
01:17:50,210 --> 01:17:52,770
WAIT!

943
01:18:03,970 --> 01:18:06,848
Now, THAT was an adventure.

944
01:18:06,930 --> 01:18:09,524
Yes. Yes, it was. And, um...

945
01:18:09,570 --> 01:18:12,687
It was so much gold!

946
01:18:18,770 --> 01:18:21,728
- I'm fine.
- Good.

947
01:18:21,770 --> 01:18:24,045
Let's go.

948
01:18:29,930 --> 01:18:31,921
Partner.

949
01:18:34,850 --> 01:18:36,647
Partner.

950
01:18:36,690 --> 01:18:41,525
Hey, guys, come on! You don't wanna
stay here forever, do you?

951
01:18:41,570 --> 01:18:45,279
- But we don't have a map.
- We don't have a plan.

952
01:18:45,330 --> 01:18:47,446
That's why it's interesting!

953
01:18:47,490 --> 01:18:50,880
- You're right!
- What are we waiting for?

954
01:18:50,930 --> 01:18:52,841
Let's follow that trail!

955
01:18:52,890 --> 01:18:55,450
Hyah!

956
01:18:55,490 --> 01:18:58,288
# Oh, the sweet unfolding

957
01:18:58,330 --> 01:19:01,766
# Of an antique mystery

958
01:19:01,810 --> 01:19:04,961
# All will be revealed... #

959
01:19:05,010 --> 01:19:09,162
Chel, we're not on the horse!

960
01:19:09,210 --> 01:19:11,929
# On the trail we blaze #

961
01:19:21,570 --> 01:19:24,562
# Here comes the night

962
01:19:24,610 --> 01:19:27,363
# Here come the memories

963
01:19:27,410 --> 01:19:30,208
# Lost in your arms

964
01:19:30,250 --> 01:19:32,844
# Down in the foreign fields

965
01:19:32,890 --> 01:19:36,326
