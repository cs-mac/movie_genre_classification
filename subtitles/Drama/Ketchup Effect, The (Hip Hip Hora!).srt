1
00:00:45,278 --> 00:00:46,404
Let's get to work.

2
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:53,180
We make the perfect team!
Just remember.

3
00:01:00,293 --> 00:01:01,419
You stay here. I'll go alone.

4
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,528
Why?

5
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:04,755
Dangerous work is a man's job.

6
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,059
Let me take care of it.

7
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:55,485
Lila was my third partner in the
"Anti-vampire League"

8
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:57,885
She was the only one I loved.

9
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,918
Because I didn't want my heart
broken any more,

10
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,029
I decided not to fall in love
with my partner again.

11
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,950
Master, do you really like this place?

12
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:41,118
It's really not bad...

13
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,319
I see! You're his boss!
You really have good taste!

14
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:45,794
When do you want to start the lease?

15
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:49,929
You can only talk to me.

16
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:50,864
Then, I'll talk to my master.

17
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:52,970
Do you understand?

18
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,239
Yes, sir.

19
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,567
Mr. Prada, when would you like

20
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:59,210
to start the lease?

21
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:02,209
I don't want to rent.

22
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:03,975
You think we can't afford to buy it?

23
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:10,515
Take it home and count it.

24
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:12,146
Tell me if it's a penny short.

25
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,048
Prada, watch them.

26
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:45,349
I've told you,
we are members of the royal family.

27
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,391
We should behave well!

28
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:52,230
Remember, we drink blood,
but we don't suck blood.

29
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:53,854
We are different!

30
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:59,237
Sir, we're still vampires.

31
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:01,100
Even if we can bear to
live in a church,

32
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,867
it's still not a good idea.

33
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:09,071
Prada, don't be so retro!

34
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:13,948
We're new age vampires!
Let's move with the times, okay?

35
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:27,755
- Take a seat, please.
- Thank you.

36
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,841
Isn't it a bit crowded?

37
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,341
Excuse me!

38
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:42,943
As this lady said,
this place is a bit crowded for us.

39
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:44,481
Can you ask these people

40
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,050
to move to other seats?

41
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:50,785
I don't think we can do that, sir...

42
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:53,915
That's all right. I've got money.

43
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:58,524
I'll give them $5,000 each,
what do you think?

44
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,925
I'll try, sir.

45
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:01,761
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.

46
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,862
Ken, you're incredible!

47
00:15:05,804 --> 00:15:08,864
Sir, that gentleman wants
to give you back $50,000!

48
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,943
Bobo, I have to tell you something.

49
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,384
I'm taking a big risk

50
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:25,717
having dinner with you.

51
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,325
You mean you're still afraid of...

52
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:31,125
Don't mention her name! She's scary!

53
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,527
Once you say her name, she'll appear!

54
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:37,261
It happens all the time!

55
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,904
But you can't keep avoiding Helen!

56
00:15:48,681 --> 00:15:49,943
Miss...

57
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:01,317
What did you promise me?

58
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,958
What was it?

59
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:08,596
First, you won't stop loving me

60
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,826
before I stop loving you.

61
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,134
What does that mean?

62
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:14,936
Put simply,

63
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:17,901
only I can dump you.

64
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:24,006
Secondly,
when you choose another girlfriend,

65
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,878
she must be better than me.

66
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:27,746
That's right!

67
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:30,047
Come on! Show Helen your figure!

68
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:35,050
Where you go in, she goes out.

69
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:37,219
Where you go out, she goes in.

70
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:40,332
Where you're flat, she's round.

71
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:42,829
I've kept my promise!

72
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,928
I was just kidding!

73
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:48,501
It's okay!

74
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:53,069
May I borrow your knife?

75
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:56,810
It's okay! Take them all!

76
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:07,152
You promised me that
if you were not loyal to me,

77
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:09,688
you have to cut something off.

78
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:10,795
Sir, should I call the police?

79
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:12,260
No!

80
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:18,193
If I cut it off, are we quits?

81
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:20,435
That's right.

82
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,039
Okay!

83
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:25,443
This is to pay you back
for your wronged love!

84
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:41,592
Take it.

85
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:53,736
Let me drink this.

86
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:55,804
You can't drink this wine.
Let's order something else.

87
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:59,339
Hey, please open a bottle of finest
red wine for this lady, on me!

88
00:17:59,478 --> 00:18:00,536
Why can't I drink this wine?

89
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:01,543
How can you drink this glass of wine?

90
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,738
Prada!

91
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,314
This is just my personal opinion.

92
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:24,430
Don't cry!

93
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,563
I didn't cry!

94
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:36,740
When I knew that guy,

95
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:39,146
he was 130 lbs.

96
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:43,280
When his weight reached 160,

97
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:46,922
I had no more feeling for him.

98
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:54,296
But, I respected him;
I didn't break up with him.

99
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:02,238
How can he cheat on me?

100
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,177
He doesn't respect me at all!

101
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:10,477
I'm happy to break up with him.

102
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:43,573
Is your name Helen?

103
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,911
Can we be friends?

104
00:19:47,052 --> 00:19:49,885
I'm Kazaf.
I just got back from abroad.

105
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:54,183
9877, try to call me.

106
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:08,405
I can't find her! You got anything?

107
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,371
We've made hundreds of calls, sir!

108
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,944
I think she's just messing with you!

109
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:19,546
You can't trust human beings, sir.
Especially woman.

110
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,653
They're always having mood swings!

111
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,119
Did you notice that?

112
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:27,157
She cried and then she laughed!
She's crazy!

113
00:20:32,197 --> 00:20:37,328
I just love that! I think she's great!

114
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:39,264
Have you ever seen a vampire
like that before?

115
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:41,668
Sir, even if you can find her,

116
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:44,742
human beings may not accept us.

117
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:48,836
It's better to date a female vampire.

118
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:51,609
After looking at her,
look at yourself.

119
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:56,217
Then, she'll come forward!
It's rather simple!

120
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:59,990
I want something more!

121
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:04,219
Something more?
You want to fall in love with food?

122
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:07,025
Men don't fall in love with food!

123
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:08,132
Have you seen someone

124
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,202
fall in love with a piece of salmon?

125
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:14,032
When you're hungry, you eat it!

126
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:19,735
I like her, so I won't suck her blood.

127
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:24,110
Anyway,
my father sends me blood every week.

128
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:51,540
Hello?

129
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:53,838
Hello? Is Helen there?

130
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:54,944
Speaking.

131
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,844
Is that you?
I'm the guy you met in the restaurant!

132
00:21:58,283 --> 00:22:00,808
Are you crazy?
Do you know what time it is?

133
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:11,319
Show me how to send a picture, please.

134
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:44,790
My idol!

135
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,190
It's you!

136
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:48,459
Why do you have my picture?

137
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,465
Well, it's because you're my idol.

138
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:51,431
When I joined the League,

139
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:53,127
I heard many things about you.

140
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:55,034
I'm so happy to learn from my hero!

141
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:58,104
When did you come out?
I didn't see you!

142
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,301
I wanted to watch you waiting for me,

143
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:03,038
so I took an early flight.

144
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:05,641
Really?

145
00:23:06,284 --> 00:23:08,081
I've heard so much about you!

146
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,812
You joined the League 5 years ago.

147
00:23:10,021 --> 00:23:12,751
You've killed 123 vampires.

148
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:15,086
You're the best vampire killer
in the League.

149
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,426
You really did your homework.

150
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,620
Let me help you!

151
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,030
I've got it.

152
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,229
Thank you.

153
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:31,575
From now on,
let me handle this stuff, okay?

154
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,337
As my assistant,
you have to remember two things.

155
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:35,571
Just follow my orders...

156
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:37,944
...without argument.

157
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:40,045
That means I just have to follow you?

158
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:42,176
That's right,
just like Batman and Robin.

159
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:44,478
We ordinary people
can't fight vampires.

160
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:47,353
So, we have to use vampire blood
to upgrade our power.

161
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,287
It doesn't taste good!

162
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,919
If it lets us beat vampires,
we shouldn't mind the taste!

163
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:54,122
The effect of the vampire blood,

164
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,598
only lasts for one and a half hours.

165
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,793
If we don't take the antidote by then,

166
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,437
we'll become vampires for real.

167
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:01,798
So, in that case...

168
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:03,372
If one of us becomes a vampire,

169
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:04,805
what do we do?

170
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:07,942
Even though it seems cruel,

171
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:09,205
Kill without mercy!

172
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:11,777
What antidote do we need?

173
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:15,578
This is the antidote.

174
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:18,287
Banana essence?

175
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:21,587
Smart, eh? This is just a cover.

176
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:24,055
There isn't any banana flavor.

177
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:25,693
It's just for disguising it.

178
00:24:38,243 --> 00:24:39,574
What is it?

179
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:47,009
Let me introduce you guys.
This is my new partner, Gypsy.

180
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,710
This is my sister, Helen.

181
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,823
Stop!

182
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:55,483
I'll sleep with you!

183
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,929
Would you please show me some respect?

184
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:01,457
She sleeps in my room,

185
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,931
you sleep here
and I'll sleep outside, okay?

186
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:04,633
All right, you take my room,

187
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:06,202
she sleeps here
and I'll sleep outside.

188
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:13,507
You told me that your sister is nice

189
00:25:13,645 --> 00:25:14,942
and easy to get along with.

190
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,344
Well, everyone has their own way
to express their feelings.

191
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:19,177
She's really very nice.

192
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:22,417
What's up?

193
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:27,087
Come on! I only used a little!

194
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,453
How could she tell?

195
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:32,919
Okay. Anyway, you can use my stuff,

196
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:34,554
but never touch any of her things,
okay?

197
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,850
I wanted to keep you.

198
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:57,586
But you look too much like
that fat bastard!

199
00:25:58,723 --> 00:25:59,985
I just want to dump all you fat guys!

200
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,578
What are you doing with my stuff?

201
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:33,524
You threw it away.
I just wanted to take a look at it.

202
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:35,592
I didn't throw it away!
I just put it there!

203
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:37,792
You're being ridiculous!

204
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,487
So what if I am? Give it back!

205
00:29:36,474 --> 00:29:37,498
Stop!

206
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:41,873
What are you fighting about?

207
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:52,513
What are you doing?

208
00:29:52,657 --> 00:29:53,646
You!

209
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:58,389
Is that any of my business?

210
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:01,965
Why didn't you tidy up
after the fight?

211
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:13,608
- Hello.
- Hello!

212
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,580
Is that you? Are you looking for me?

213
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:19,145
I just want to know whether your phone
is out of battery or not.

214
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:22,014
No, it's full!

215
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,381
So what?

216
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:26,589
From the sound of your voice,
I can tell you're bored.

217
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:29,859
I'm not in the mood!

218
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:31,355
What's the matter?

219
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:34,926
None of your business!

220
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:38,562
Let me tell you a joke!

221
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:15,099
Okay, see you at noon
the day after tomorrow, okay? Bye!

222
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:19,999
Sir, did you make a date
to meet her at noon?

223
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:21,839
Yes. What's the problem?

224
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:24,479
The sun!

225
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,849
Oh yes! The sun!

226
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:29,647
It will kill you!

227
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:31,448
What should I do then?

228
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:34,314
Make it at night,
12 midnight instead, okay?

229
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:37,484
No,
I promised her to go, so I must go.

230
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,851
Your report had been sucessfully sent.

231
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:43,022
Don't worry! We can get him!

232
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:45,459
I'm not worried
about getting him or not.

233
00:32:45,596 --> 00:32:48,258
Actually, these European vampires
seldom appear in Asia,

234
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:49,593
When I got my orders this morning,

235
00:32:49,734 --> 00:32:50,996
I thought the League made a mistake.

236
00:32:51,669 --> 00:32:54,570
I think this is related to my orders.

237
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,537
Only one prince is left after the
assassination of the entire royal family

238
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:01,042
The vampire King
and five of the princes were killed!

239
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:02,837
Is that an internal conflict within
the royal family of the vampires?

240
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:26,603
My dear son, the Duke has revolted
against the royal family.

241
00:33:26,771 --> 00:33:31,470
Your father has already escaped,
he asks you to take care of yourself.

242
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:36,474
He wants you to protect this book.

243
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:37,740
"Day for night".

244
00:33:37,882 --> 00:33:40,009
Five princes were killed
and their blood essence stolen.

245
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:42,218
I think this is related to this book,
"Day for night".

246
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:43,786
Day for night?

247
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:46,650
What's it about?

248
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,853
It's the bible of
the royal family of the vampires.

249
00:33:49,994 --> 00:33:52,326
It's a family treasure heirloom.
You mustn't lose it.

250
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,228
"Day for night",
a holy scripture of the vampires.

251
00:33:57,402 --> 00:33:58,528
Within it, there is

252
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,295
the blood of the Ultimate Vampire.

253
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:02,234
If any vampire drinks it,

254
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,738
he'll be able to move
freely in daytime.

255
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,810
What's that got to do
with the death of the princes?

256
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:08,404
Its said that

257
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:09,877
the only key to open the scripture,

258
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:12,005
is found in the blood
of those princes.

259
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,514
So, he is the last key
to open the treasure.

260
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:20,720
That's right,
we must find him as soon as possible.

261
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:22,018
I heard that a vampire

262
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,287
tried this method before.

263
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:27,796
2000 years ago,
Sir Nicolas tried it in Poland,

264
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:29,798
What did he use?

265
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,760
As recorded in an ancient book,
he had a kind of sun cream.

266
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:35,565
After putting some on his body,
he could walk in daytime.

267
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,901
He could swim too.

268
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:41,739
Where can I find this kind
of sun cream?

269
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:44,871
Well, it's not for sale,
but I think we can make some.

270
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:49,546
First, add two drops of absinth juice.

271
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,951
Then, add some refined olive oil.

272
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:55,882
Mix with red wine.

273
00:34:58,162 --> 00:35:01,689
Then, add some refined sesame paste.

274
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:07,794
With some potassium.

275
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:10,738
Then, add some face cream into it.

276
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:13,006
Is it just a test?

277
00:35:13,211 --> 00:35:15,304
All scientific achievements
are the result of tests.

278
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:19,047
That's right! Okay, go ahead.

279
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:24,919
After diluting it,

280
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:27,783
Put in an oven for 3 hours,

281
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:29,620
then put under the sun.

282
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,886
For how long?

283
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:32,188
For 300 years.

284
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:33,729
300 years!

285
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:35,761
The longer its under the sun,
the better it'll work.

286
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,595
Perhaps you can try putting it
under the sun for 3 hours.

287
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:39,292
It may not have quite the same effect.

288
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:41,638
Have you tried it?

289
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:43,296
Of course not! You think I'm crazy?

290
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,639
I bet some vampires
have tried it before.

291
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:49,006
I think Sir Nicolas tried it.

292
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,310
Helen, Helen!

293
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,192
Who are you?

294
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,421
I'm Kazaf!

295
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:12,862
Well, you look great!

296
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:14,004
Really?

297
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:15,899
Aren't you happy?

298
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,971
If you don't want to date me,

299
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:19,667
just say so! I hate your look!

300
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:21,706
But you said it was great!

301
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,746
I was being sarcastic!

302
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:28,183
Let me be honest.
I've had a blood problem since birth.

303
00:36:28,386 --> 00:36:30,047
I can't go out in the sun.

304
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:32,416
I'm risking my life
going out like this.

305
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:39,396
You should have just changed
the time for our date!

306
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:41,823
A man should keep his word.

307
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:49,262
- Hello.
- Welcome!

308
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:51,404
Sorry we're late. It's his fault.

309
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:55,069
He's going to a fancy
dress party later!

310
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,477
- I'm sorry.
- And you two are...

311
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:01,813
Where are lvy and Jackie?

312
00:37:01,953 --> 00:37:03,648
They're over there!
Please help yourself.

313
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:04,846
Okay.

314
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,218
Do you always gatecrash
this kind of thing?

315
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:09,155
Don't you think joining
a wedding party is warm and happy?

316
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:10,089
Thank you.

317
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,456
Jackie, congratulations!

318
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:15,123
Wait! Even though I look so smart,

319
00:37:15,266 --> 00:37:20,260
I'm not the groom. He is.

320
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:21,405
Congratulations!

321
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:22,766
Thank you...

322
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,238
I've never got married before.
I'm so nervous!

323
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,105
Son, just calm down!
You have nothing to worry about!

324
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:30,075
When I was shooting a penalty kick
in a soccer match,

325
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:31,704
I felt great pressure!

326
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:32,941
But I wasn't afraid!

327
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,016
Did you score?

328
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:35,880
- Jackie, lvy's gone!
- The ball flew into the grandstand.

329
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,488
Even though I failed, I wasn't afraid.

330
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:40,121
- Well, my son...
- Yes?

331
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,122
Where is your wife?

332
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,248
I am looking for her too.

333
00:37:42,393 --> 00:37:43,792
Would you please
take care of yourselves?

334
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:44,986
- Okay.
- Thank you.

335
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,159
Is he your boyfriend?

336
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:49,490
Yes.

337
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:50,862
Why is he so oily!

338
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,293
Where is my wife?

339
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,630
She's drinking!

340
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:55,802
It's great!

341
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,773
Honey, why are you drinking already?

342
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,071
I learned a new drinking game.

343
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:02,270
Let me show you.

344
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:03,380
One, two, three!

345
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:04,742
Stallone...

346
00:38:04,882 --> 00:38:06,179
Bruce Lee...

347
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:08,114
Jackie Chan...

348
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,146
Isn't it fun?

349
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,414
Honey, how much have you guys drunk?

350
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:12,613
Just two cases of wine! Not much!

351
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:13,985
What? That's much too much!

352
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:17,219
I told my father that you're a lady!

353
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:19,988
A lady? Oh yes! I just forgot!

354
00:38:21,098 --> 00:38:22,690
Don't embarrass me, okay?

355
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:24,061
Okay! I really love you!

356
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:25,293
Don't go.

357
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:29,370
My husband is giving me
a 4-karat ring.

358
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:31,507
I'm so happy!

359
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:32,939
I just want her to be happy.

360
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:34,544
Jackie,
would you come here for a moment?

361
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:35,475
Take care of her please.

362
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:36,841
Take care of her!

363
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,015
- Jackie
- What's the matter?

364
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,710
We've been friends for ages,

365
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:44,081
I am so proud

366
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:46,212
I introduced you to lvy!

367
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:47,324
And I really

368
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,187
appreciate that.

369
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,521
You're welcome.

370
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,595
So, if I make

371
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,788
a mistake today,

372
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:55,228
please forgive me.

373
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,533
What's up?

374
00:38:57,768 --> 00:38:59,235
Well, it's no big deal!

375
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:01,235
I just lost your 4-karat ring.

376
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:05,640
You're kidding, right?

377
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:08,006
No, I really lost it.

378
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:12,475
Calm down.

379
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,209
Have you searched everywhere?

380
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:18,550
I did! Did I give it to you?

381
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:20,120
No.

382
00:39:20,758 --> 00:39:21,656
I'm doomed!

383
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:23,191
You're really doomed!

384
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:26,556
No matter what,
you have to find it for me.

385
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,460
Don't worry,
I already asked someone to find it.

386
00:39:28,766 --> 00:39:30,495
One more thing, don't let her know.

387
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,065
I've already searched
every inch of this place.

388
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:38,471
You really dropped me in it this time!
Are you crazy?

389
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:40,770
How can you lose something
so precious?

390
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:45,141
May I take a picture of you two?

391
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:46,340
- Sure!
- Okay.

392
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:51,420
One, two, three.

393
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:54,486
- All right!
- Okay.

394
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:10,765
Let's eat.

395
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:13,708
What do you want to eat?

396
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:16,642
Eat whatever you like! It's free!

397
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:21,583
Don't you want to eat?
You're hungry, aren't you?

398
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:26,916
Bananas!

399
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:28,689
Just bananas?

400
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:31,087
Yes, I love eating bananas.

401
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:33,125
- You love bananas?
- Yes, they're delicious.

402
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:37,194
Take a bunch, then! It's free.

403
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,630
I just heard something exciting!

404
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:43,399
The groom lost the wedding ring!

405
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:45,735
What? Does lvy know?

406
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,308
Welcome! Thank you being here today.

407
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,606
Let's give a big hand
to the bride and the groom!

408
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:55,042
Jackie and lvy have known each other
for seven years.

409
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:58,778
They met on this same day

410
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:00,686
of seven years ago.

411
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:02,290
So, they chose

412
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:05,395
this day to get married.

413
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:08,327
To bring them the greatest joy
and happiness.

414
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:13,233
Now, may I have everyone's attention?

415
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:14,632
May I borrow it?

416
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,067
I bet all of you want to see

417
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:17,936
how gorgeous the wedding ring is...

418
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:20,043
It took the groom 2 years
to save up for it...

419
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:22,338
What's up?

420
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:23,445
Just take it.

421
00:41:23,581 --> 00:41:25,446
- It's time to change the rings.
- Just take it.

422
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,226
What is it?

423
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:42,525
It's a bat ring.

424
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,395
Are you kidding?

425
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:46,160
I'll give you the 4-karat ring later.

426
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,100
Just wait a while, okay?

427
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:50,001
It's time for the toast!

428
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,971
- Cheers!
- Time's up!

429
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:53,743
Honey, stop it! No more wine.

430
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:55,277
- Please.
- I want to drink it.

431
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,781
So what?

432
00:42:03,821 --> 00:42:06,984
Please! Don't drink it.

433
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:08,113
Give it to me!

434
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:09,453
No!

435
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:12,858
No!

436
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:16,091
I want to drink it!
It hurts!

437
00:42:16,267 --> 00:42:18,394
Honey, I'm sorry, you...

438
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:20,059
No!

439
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:26,506
Honey, are you crazy?

440
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:29,169
I'm sorry. I shouldn't yell at you!

441
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:33,943
Ivy! Don't marry him. Come with me!

442
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:36,577
Ivy!

443
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:49,488
How dare you ruin my wedding party?

444
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:56,264
Daddy!

445
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,704
Great! Son,
you're got yourself a great gal there!

446
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:02,505
- Honey, you're the best!
- Honey!

447
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:15,586
Hey, you're burning!

448
00:43:15,726 --> 00:43:17,284
Burning again?

449
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,726
Oh no!
My sun cream doesn't work any more.

450
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:21,023
Let's go!

451
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:39,479
Why are you staring at my back?

452
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:40,976
Nothing.

453
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:43,512
Well, it's just attractive.

454
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:44,949
Really?

455
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:46,654
Is it that why you...

456
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,621
ask your partner

457
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:49,987
to follow you everywhere?

458
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:51,824
Of course not!

459
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:56,831
Let me ask you one thing,
why did you call me your idol?

460
00:43:57,167 --> 00:44:00,261
Vampires killed my parents.

461
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:03,232
So I swore,

462
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:05,875
I would kill them
all to avenge my parents.

463
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:09,307
You are the greatest vampire killer.

464
00:44:09,446 --> 00:44:11,346
So that makes you my idol.

465
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:16,616
Do you believe me?

466
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:19,652
I just made it up!

467
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:28,890
Actually, its just because you're
the most handsome guy in the League.

468
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,028
That's it?

469
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:34,102
Girls are always so naive!

470
00:44:37,641 --> 00:44:39,040
I made that up, too!

471
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,077
Why do you keep lying?

472
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:46,180
All your former partners say
you're a sentimental person.

473
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:48,982
I just lied to them.

474
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:58,023
You stay here! I'll handle this.

475
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:13,824
Let me do it!

476
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:38,021
Let me do it!

477
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:39,247
It's gone.

478
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:41,289
I said it's gone!

479
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:44,822
It's really gone!

480
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:47,225
Really?

481
00:47:48,265 --> 00:47:49,129
Where is the antidote?

482
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:50,062
I thought you had it?

483
00:47:50,234 --> 00:47:51,462
You brought it. Give it to me.

484
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:52,828
I brought it?

485
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:55,438
Oh, yes!

486
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:06,975
- Banana flavor?
- I feel so good!

487
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:10,783
Does yours taste of banana?

488
00:48:10,921 --> 00:48:13,253
No. You said it was just a cover.

489
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:16,758
So there's no banana flavor.

490
00:48:19,162 --> 00:48:21,824
That bat has almost starved to death.

491
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:23,896
If we don't find some blood,

492
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:26,058
we'll starve to death too.

493
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:31,432
I've told you so many times!
I don't know how to suck blood.

494
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:35,135
You know, but you won't do it.

495
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:43,717
Hello?

496
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:53,261
How did you know I was here?

497
00:48:53,397 --> 00:48:55,422
I followed you, that's how.

498
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:58,033
Do you always follow people?

499
00:48:58,702 --> 00:48:59,828
Don't you like it?

500
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:01,529
Okay, I won't follow you again.

501
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:05,498
Why do you live in a church?

502
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:11,643
Are you a Christian?
Are you a devout Christian?

503
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:15,546
I made a banana cake for you!

504
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:17,083
I bet you haven't eaten yet.

505
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,111
Neither my master nor l
have eaten yet.

506
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:20,382
Prada, no!

507
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:21,650
Master.

508
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:22,850
No!

509
00:49:22,993 --> 00:49:26,656
Are you hungry?
Come on! Take a bite! It's delicious!

510
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:27,957
Don't bother him!

511
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:39,107
Why is there a coffin here?

512
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:41,040
That's my bed.

513
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:42,936
You sleep in a coffin?

514
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,574
My family runs funeral business.

515
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:48,275
I'm trying some new designs.

516
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:49,945
You designed this?

517
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:51,145
That's right.

518
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:54,824
Really? It's beautiful!

519
00:49:56,693 --> 00:49:58,558
Can I take a look at it?

520
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:01,186
Sure!

521
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,403
You're really talented!

522
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:16,744
Can I try it out?

523
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:28,855
I love the lighting! It's great!

524
00:50:29,993 --> 00:50:31,654
Yes, it's great!

525
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:37,962
Did someone say he was hungry?

526
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:39,895
Yes.

527
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:45,808
Eat it.
It's banana flavor. You'll love it.

528
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:51,645
Don't worry. There's plenty more.

529
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:55,546
No! We've lost the antidote!

530
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,154
- Wait!
- What?

531
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:00,688
- Can you smell that?
- What is it?

532
00:51:00,824 --> 00:51:02,223
Bananas.

533
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:09,322
Why did you use
banana flavor as a cover?

534
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:10,865
My sister hates the smell of ba...

535
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:13,903
What's the matter? What are you doing?

536
00:51:15,705 --> 00:51:17,764
It must be the vampire blood...

537
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:20,337
Take it.

538
00:51:21,478 --> 00:51:22,877
If I become a vampire,

539
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:24,571
Kill me, understand?

540
00:51:27,484 --> 00:51:29,384
The cake must be full of antidote!

541
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:30,679
That's right.

542
00:51:30,987 --> 00:51:32,113
Eat it.

543
00:51:32,322 --> 00:51:33,721
Eat this one too.

544
00:51:41,865 --> 00:51:43,730
How do you feel?

545
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:46,834
I feel much better.

546
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:48,195
Do you want water?

547
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:52,699
Thank you!

548
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:58,979
What's up? Do I look ugly?

549
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,640
No! Not ugly at all.

550
00:52:05,097 --> 00:52:07,793
Any more cakes? Hand them over!

551
00:52:19,178 --> 00:52:21,578
Make it quick!
You're driving me crazy!

552
00:52:30,022 --> 00:52:31,546
I've forgotten to tell you one thing,

553
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:34,215
If I get vampire teeth, remember,

554
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:35,553
Kill me at once!

555
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:36,683
At once.

556
00:53:58,243 --> 00:54:02,270
No! No!

557
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:42,578
Don't die!

558
00:54:43,355 --> 00:54:45,346
Don't leave me alone!

559
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:50,359
I promise, I'll be your best partner.

560
00:54:51,363 --> 00:54:56,323
I'll listen to you!
I won't fight with your sister again.

561
00:54:57,302 --> 00:54:59,429
Wake up, please!

562
00:55:00,872 --> 00:55:03,306
Do you want me to tell you everything?

563
00:55:04,609 --> 00:55:07,169
I really love you!

564
00:55:11,249 --> 00:55:13,479
Can you hear me?

565
00:55:21,593 --> 00:55:26,587
I'm alive!
But I don't know what you just said.

566
00:55:27,966 --> 00:55:30,560
What? What is it?

567
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:40,406
I said... I am not that easy to kill.

568
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:42,873
I couldn't hear what you said.

569
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:45,016
It's just too noisy.

570
00:55:45,584 --> 00:55:50,521
Okay, I'll shut up!
Let's take a rest now.

571
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,427
Your cake is really delicious.

572
00:56:03,668 --> 00:56:05,727
Your coffin is so comfortable.

573
00:56:06,204 --> 00:56:07,262
Bye!

574
00:56:09,107 --> 00:56:10,665
Are you looking for trouble?

575
00:56:10,942 --> 00:56:12,375
That kiss was okay,

576
00:56:12,544 --> 00:56:13,704
but you're not allowed
to kiss me again.

577
00:56:42,574 --> 00:56:48,308
What you said before...

578
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:50,741
I heard everything!

579
00:56:58,557 --> 00:56:59,990
Is anyone home?

580
00:57:01,226 --> 00:57:02,784
Miss Momoko,
what a coincidence to see you here.

581
00:57:02,928 --> 00:57:05,556
Mr. Prada,
I've brought you some papers to sign.

582
00:57:05,697 --> 00:57:07,028
And I've brought you something else.

583
00:57:07,666 --> 00:57:08,724
Please wait.

584
00:57:10,268 --> 00:57:12,361
This is the last chance!
I'll bite her neck.

585
00:57:12,504 --> 00:57:13,562
And you can choose
any position you like.

586
00:57:13,705 --> 00:57:15,900
Pulse, or inner thigh, or an armpit.

587
00:57:16,041 --> 00:57:18,737
Let's bite her together,
and then suck her blood.

588
00:57:20,178 --> 00:57:23,670
I told you many times! I don't suck.

589
00:57:27,552 --> 00:57:30,612
Okay, I'll suck her blood
and put it into a jar.

590
00:57:30,755 --> 00:57:33,189
I'll serve you
with a glass of it, okay?

591
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:35,588
You used to serve it like that to me.

592
00:57:41,199 --> 00:57:42,791
But that's all over now.

593
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:47,768
Forget the past!

594
00:57:49,941 --> 00:57:54,401
I'm telling you for the last time.
I won't suck blood.

595
00:57:57,048 --> 00:58:00,017
I see! You have fallen for that girl.

596
00:58:00,418 --> 00:58:02,909
Tell me, you think

597
00:58:03,088 --> 00:58:04,953
you're fit to be a vampire?

598
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:06,921
Have you got
what it takes to be a prince?

599
00:58:07,058 --> 00:58:09,049
Are you qualified
to succeed the throne?

600
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:10,218
Are you giving me a lecture?

601
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:11,852
Try to tell her tomorrow,
tell her that you're a vampire.

602
00:58:11,997 --> 00:58:14,397
See if she's generous enough
to give you her blood.

603
00:58:20,372 --> 00:58:22,306
Why are you looking at me like that?
Is it urgent?

604
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:29,647
I want to tell you what I am.

605
00:58:31,616 --> 00:58:36,144
Don't turn your back to me.
I'll get angry.

606
00:58:37,923 --> 00:58:40,915
Let me be frank.
I am not a human being.

607
00:58:41,993 --> 00:58:44,120
You're certainly not acting like one!

608
00:58:44,429 --> 00:58:46,363
How can you talk to me like that?

609
00:58:49,267 --> 00:58:50,825
I'm a vampire.

610
00:58:50,969 --> 00:58:52,459
So?

611
00:58:52,604 --> 00:58:54,299
Look at my eyes.

612
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:58,967
Cool!
Where did you get those contact lens?

613
00:59:05,283 --> 00:59:07,012
What are you yelling about?

614
00:59:07,152 --> 00:59:08,676
See? I want to suck your blood!

615
00:59:10,288 --> 00:59:13,621
That's not the right way to suck.
Suck like this.

616
00:59:16,461 --> 00:59:18,486
Let me go! Off!

617
00:59:22,701 --> 00:59:24,498
I know what you're doing!

618
00:59:24,636 --> 00:59:27,036
You want to dump me, right?

619
00:59:27,405 --> 00:59:29,771
I'm a vampire!

620
00:59:29,908 --> 00:59:31,637
Do you want
to fall in love with a vampire?

621
00:59:33,678 --> 00:59:35,168
So what's a vampire?

622
00:59:35,347 --> 00:59:37,281
Can a vampire brush
his girl off like this?

623
00:59:38,249 --> 00:59:42,686
I know! You think I'm too sassy.

624
00:59:43,254 --> 00:59:44,482
But most of the girls

625
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:46,750
in Hong Kong are sassy!

626
00:59:47,726 --> 00:59:50,354
Don't you believe me?
Go find another one.

627
00:59:51,896 --> 00:59:53,488
If you dare!

628
00:59:58,336 --> 01:00:02,966
I have some dogs at home.

629
01:00:03,708 --> 01:00:06,268
I don't mind having a vampire.

630
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:12,573
The only problem is
that my brother may not like you!

631
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:15,047
I am a vampire,

632
01:00:15,954 --> 01:00:19,720
and a useless vampire, too.

633
01:00:23,428 --> 01:00:25,157
What do you mean?

634
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:30,597
I haven't eaten for days!

635
01:00:34,205 --> 01:00:35,229
What are you doing?

636
01:00:35,373 --> 01:00:36,772
I am taking you to find food.

637
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:53,722
You stay here!
It's better for me to go alone.

638
01:00:56,127 --> 01:00:57,355
Be careful!

639
01:02:11,836 --> 01:02:13,235
It's time to eat.

640
01:02:13,371 --> 01:02:15,339
Something's wrong, let's run!

641
01:02:15,473 --> 01:02:17,566
Did you get caught?

642
01:02:18,476 --> 01:02:19,875
Can you hear that?

643
01:02:20,044 --> 01:02:21,306
What is it?

644
01:02:21,479 --> 01:02:22,741
Bats.

645
01:02:22,914 --> 01:02:26,077
If there are bats around,
it means vampires are around, too.

646
01:02:26,217 --> 01:02:27,241
Let's run!

647
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:28,039
Why is the hospital alarm ringing?

648
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:29,677
Has there been a robbery?

649
01:03:29,814 --> 01:03:30,974
I think it's just a mistake.

650
01:03:31,149 --> 01:03:32,377
I don't think any thief would be
stupid enough to steal from a hospital.

651
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:35,247
Who knows? Thieves are everywhere.

652
01:03:35,386 --> 01:03:37,320
Your car could even get stolen.

653
01:03:40,325 --> 01:03:41,349
Speak of the devil!

654
01:03:41,492 --> 01:03:42,618
What's the matter?

655
01:03:43,294 --> 01:03:44,921
Who are you?

656
01:03:45,129 --> 01:03:47,063
I am so glad to see you again!
I saved you last time.

657
01:03:47,198 --> 01:03:48,756
Would you help us now?

658
01:03:50,068 --> 01:03:51,467
Your friend is dying!

659
01:03:51,603 --> 01:03:53,434
That's right! I think he's dying!

660
01:03:53,571 --> 01:03:56,369
He has to get to another hospital!
Please take him there now.

661
01:03:56,507 --> 01:03:57,496
But I have to take
something to the hospital.

662
01:03:57,642 --> 01:03:59,041
The "something"
you have to take is him.

663
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:01,610
Take him there now, or he'll die!

664
01:04:01,813 --> 01:04:03,542
Come on! Hurry!

665
01:04:03,715 --> 01:04:05,307
Let's go! Please!

666
01:04:19,731 --> 01:04:21,494
Are you feeling bad?

667
01:04:21,633 --> 01:04:23,533
Do you want to suck my blood?

668
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:26,464
Of course not!

669
01:04:26,604 --> 01:04:28,435
I can treat your teeth
like mosquitoes!

670
01:04:29,007 --> 01:04:31,305
If you don't eat, you'll die!

671
01:04:53,631 --> 01:04:55,895
Jackie, driver faster please.

672
01:04:56,768 --> 01:04:57,928
What's up?

673
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:01,564
Who are these guys?

674
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:24,189
Help!

675
01:06:00,064 --> 01:06:01,395
Be careful!

676
01:06:02,633 --> 01:06:04,897
I don't know how to drive!

677
01:06:11,876 --> 01:06:13,707
Hold the wheel tightly!

678
01:06:27,959 --> 01:06:29,824
This is bad!

679
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:07,220
Are you okay?

680
01:07:09,834 --> 01:07:11,495
What the hell are you?

681
01:07:11,769 --> 01:07:13,259
This is terrible! I ran someone over!

682
01:07:13,404 --> 01:07:15,895
Vampires! They are vampires!

683
01:07:16,841 --> 01:07:17,830
Vampires?

684
01:07:21,646 --> 01:07:22,670
He can fly!

685
01:09:36,914 --> 01:09:38,176
Come on up!

686
01:10:10,781 --> 01:10:12,248
- Throw me another bag of blood!
- Okay!

687
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:16,246
It's working! This is type AB.

688
01:10:39,510 --> 01:10:41,205
Are there really vampires?

689
01:10:52,857 --> 01:10:53,949
It works!

690
01:10:59,997 --> 01:11:01,259
What did you give them?

691
01:11:01,399 --> 01:11:03,367
It's a kind of tranquilizer.
It should calm them down.

692
01:11:03,668 --> 01:11:05,226
They ate so much!

693
01:11:05,369 --> 01:11:07,701
It's making them go crazy!
Turn on the music now.

694
01:11:31,262 --> 01:11:32,524
Drink it.

695
01:11:36,634 --> 01:11:40,730
Come on! I brought it for you!

696
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:45,172
Do you feel better?

697
01:11:53,384 --> 01:11:54,351
Well...

698
01:11:59,724 --> 01:12:01,316
Jackie asked me to return it to you.

699
01:12:32,323 --> 01:12:33,620
What does this mean?

700
01:12:36,127 --> 01:12:41,963
The ring is too tight!
I can't get it off.

701
01:13:14,131 --> 01:13:15,325
Good morning.

702
01:13:17,601 --> 01:13:18,659
Good morning!

703
01:13:45,896 --> 01:13:49,730
You help my brother
to iron his clothes?

704
01:13:50,301 --> 01:13:52,360
I'll iron them from now on.

705
01:13:54,538 --> 01:13:58,474
Congratulations!
You've found someone you can love.

706
01:13:58,609 --> 01:13:59,633
Haven't you fallen in love
with someone too?

707
01:13:59,777 --> 01:14:03,736
He's great. He's just terrific.

708
01:14:04,615 --> 01:14:08,813
But sometimes,
he's not that good to me...

709
01:14:08,953 --> 01:14:12,116
The harder it is to fall in love
with him, the more I love the feeling!

710
01:14:13,524 --> 01:14:18,461
Anyway, there is something missing!
So I just couldn't fall in love.

711
01:14:19,430 --> 01:14:20,863
What's missing?

712
01:14:22,666 --> 01:14:24,998
That is...

713
01:14:25,135 --> 01:14:26,466
What is it?

714
01:14:26,604 --> 01:14:29,266
Something is missing...

715
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:34,341
He is the "thing" you
and my brother hate most.

716
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:41,178
Have you fallen in love
with a vampire?

717
01:14:44,788 --> 01:14:46,688
But he's a good vampire!

718
01:14:46,924 --> 01:14:48,721
Vampires suck blood and kill people!
How can that be good?

719
01:14:48,859 --> 01:14:51,760
He'd rather starve than suck blood.

720
01:14:51,896 --> 01:14:53,454
He is really nice!

721
01:14:54,865 --> 01:15:00,303
Could you say something on our behalf?

722
01:15:01,605 --> 01:15:04,005
Your brother and l
are vampire hunters.

723
01:15:05,910 --> 01:15:11,507
Please help us! Please.

724
01:15:12,683 --> 01:15:14,514
I beg you to help us!

725
01:15:14,685 --> 01:15:16,277
My dear sister-in-law!

726
01:15:17,488 --> 01:15:20,514
Come on! Please help me,
"my dear sister-in-law"!

727
01:15:24,695 --> 01:15:26,526
We are a family!

728
01:15:28,365 --> 01:15:33,268
Family! As your sister-in-law,
I'll help you, right?

729
01:15:34,371 --> 01:15:37,204
I always said my brother is lucky!

730
01:15:37,341 --> 01:15:38,831
At the first sight,

731
01:15:38,976 --> 01:15:43,003
I could tell you were really nice
as well as pretty.

732
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:47,240
Hey,
how did you win my brother's heart?

733
01:15:48,953 --> 01:15:50,181
Watch this!

734
01:15:50,487 --> 01:15:52,045
Superstar!

735
01:15:56,060 --> 01:15:56,958
Can you do that?

736
01:15:57,094 --> 01:15:58,493
It's terrible!

737
01:15:58,696 --> 01:16:00,960
But your brother likes it.

738
01:16:01,098 --> 01:16:04,966
No way! He's got special tastes!

739
01:16:05,102 --> 01:16:08,560
He likes trashy girls,
but they must be simple.

740
01:16:08,706 --> 01:16:12,267
Besides being simple,
she must be ordinary.

741
01:16:12,543 --> 01:16:13,976
Do you have any better suggestions?

742
01:16:18,515 --> 01:16:19,709
Does it work?

743
01:16:22,753 --> 01:16:24,414
How about this?

744
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:29,619
Can you do that again?

745
01:16:30,728 --> 01:16:32,218
My dear sister-in-law!

746
01:16:38,569 --> 01:16:40,469
Do you have a date?

747
01:16:40,838 --> 01:16:41,998
What do you think?

748
01:16:43,641 --> 01:16:44,938
You put on perfume!

749
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:06,994
We can go now.

750
01:17:08,632 --> 01:17:10,031
Do you like it?

751
01:17:19,343 --> 01:17:23,245
How pathetic to find
a vampire living here,

752
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:25,348
in a church!

753
01:17:31,488 --> 01:17:35,049
Now, where is the fifth prince?

754
01:17:51,642 --> 01:17:52,666
This is for you.

755
01:17:52,876 --> 01:17:53,865
What is it?

756
01:17:55,045 --> 01:17:56,239
Why is it black?

757
01:17:56,980 --> 01:17:58,914
Vampires wear black wedding gowns.

758
01:17:59,049 --> 01:18:00,016
Really?

759
01:18:27,244 --> 01:18:28,336
Well, you search over there,

760
01:18:28,512 --> 01:18:30,139
and I'll check over here.

761
01:18:39,056 --> 01:18:40,648
Why should I go there?

762
01:18:47,231 --> 01:18:48,926
What are you doing? Let go!

763
01:18:49,066 --> 01:18:50,192
Don't you love me?

764
01:18:50,768 --> 01:18:52,167
Why did you let them go?

765
01:18:52,302 --> 01:18:54,361
They're in love!

766
01:18:55,873 --> 01:18:58,000
That's my sister,
and that's a vampire!

767
01:18:58,142 --> 01:18:59,200
What did we swear

768
01:18:59,343 --> 01:19:00,469
before joining the League?

769
01:19:00,644 --> 01:19:01,508
When I took my oath,

770
01:19:01,678 --> 01:19:02,702
I didn't fall in love.

771
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:04,404
Now, I know what love is!

772
01:19:04,581 --> 01:19:06,071
Once you love a person,
you won't care about anything.

773
01:19:06,250 --> 01:19:07,877
You can tell that from
what I'm wearing.

774
01:19:14,224 --> 01:19:17,091
Didn't you promise
you'd do anything for me?

775
01:19:47,624 --> 01:19:49,285
I've got it! I'll wait for you here!

776
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:21,653
Reeve,
right where you are least expected!

777
01:20:22,192 --> 01:20:24,717
Good to see you again, old friend.

778
01:21:08,171 --> 01:21:09,570
This is my room.

779
01:21:13,043 --> 01:21:14,169
This is my bed.

780
01:21:16,246 --> 01:21:18,111
May I lie down?

781
01:21:19,216 --> 01:21:20,581
Just for sleeping?

782
01:21:24,821 --> 01:21:27,949
Go ahead,
well, it's good to take a nap.

783
01:21:28,892 --> 01:21:32,487
Our beds are not just for sleeping.

784
01:21:32,629 --> 01:21:35,723
See, it's bigger than yours.

785
01:21:36,633 --> 01:21:38,294
Are there other ways to use it?

786
01:21:38,835 --> 01:21:40,564
Such as?

787
01:21:42,239 --> 01:21:46,198
Well, chatting!
Many people love chatting in bed.

788
01:21:46,543 --> 01:21:49,842
Haven't you ever heard of
"pillow talk"?

789
01:21:51,114 --> 01:21:53,582
No. Shall we try now?

790
01:21:54,685 --> 01:21:55,709
Sure!

791
01:22:04,861 --> 01:22:06,192
Why don't you talk?

792
01:22:07,898 --> 01:22:09,160
What's up?

793
01:22:09,433 --> 01:22:10,593
Someone's here!

794
01:22:14,104 --> 01:22:16,038
My dear sister-in-law, you're home!

795
01:22:19,609 --> 01:22:21,201
Come with me now!

796
01:22:22,279 --> 01:22:23,246
What's up?

797
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:24,711
Your brother is in trouble!

798
01:22:26,616 --> 01:22:28,811
He's the only one person
who can save your brother.

799
01:22:47,504 --> 01:22:51,873
Kazaf, how long have I waited
for this moment?

800
01:22:55,278 --> 01:22:59,214
I didn't come for you. Let Reeve go.

801
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:02,842
You still dare to act like royalty?

802
01:23:04,955 --> 01:23:08,118
Bow to me,
and I may grant you an easy death.

803
01:23:09,126 --> 01:23:11,287
You still need my blood,

804
01:23:11,461 --> 01:23:12,723
If I spill it myself,

805
01:23:12,863 --> 01:23:14,592
it's worthless to you,

806
01:23:14,798 --> 01:23:16,265
Let him go.

807
01:23:16,566 --> 01:23:18,033
Why should l?

808
01:23:18,168 --> 01:23:20,932
Your friends have already
gone to rescue Reeve.

809
01:23:23,473 --> 01:23:28,342
Perhaps,
I should free this one instead?

810
01:24:18,128 --> 01:24:19,356
Reeve!

811
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:53,493
Drop the knife and he shall be free.

812
01:24:55,332 --> 01:24:58,426
No chance! Release him!

813
01:25:09,613 --> 01:25:11,308
No...

814
01:25:17,654 --> 01:25:19,087
Let him go!

815
01:26:16,479 --> 01:26:17,810
Reeve!

816
01:26:21,084 --> 01:26:23,109
Reeve! It's me!

817
01:26:27,090 --> 01:26:30,218
I'm your sister, Helen!

818
01:26:49,179 --> 01:26:52,273
So I see you are
stronger than your brothers!

819
01:28:47,731 --> 01:28:49,062
Reeve!

820
01:30:33,403 --> 01:30:35,064
Reeve!

821
01:34:13,489 --> 01:34:14,478
Gypsy!

822
01:43:02,718 --> 01:43:06,154
In this world,
there are still some vampires.

823
01:43:06,388 --> 01:43:09,380
And there are
three more vampire hunters.

824
01:43:09,658 --> 01:43:11,216
One of them is me.

825
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:14,386
One is my sister-in-law,
who's now become a semi-vampire.

826
01:43:14,530 --> 01:43:18,364
And the other one
is a sentimental vampire!

827
01:44:05,414 --> 01:44:07,382
I've brought you something to eat.

828
01:44:09,151 --> 01:44:10,448
Come on, try some!

829
01:44:15,591 --> 01:44:17,582
I really love to eat!

830
01:44:19,061 --> 01:44:21,461
So, go ahead.

831
01:44:25,267 --> 01:44:28,327
I've brought you some papers.

832
01:44:28,937 --> 01:44:30,802
Take a look, see whether
you've got any questions.

833
01:44:30,973 --> 01:44:32,440
I can do the amendments for you.

834
01:44:33,375 --> 01:44:35,240
I think something is wrong.

835
01:44:36,412 --> 01:44:40,712
What's the problem? Just tell me.

836
01:44:41,317 --> 01:44:43,251
You're disgusting!

837
01:44:53,896 --> 01:44:55,761
I feel so itchy!

838
01:45:15,184 --> 01:45:17,152
Do you always act like that?

839
01:45:19,088 --> 01:45:21,079
Do you always act like that?

840
01:45:22,324 --> 01:45:24,383
I haven't tried that before.

841
01:45:29,465 --> 01:45:30,762
Honey, I told daddy that

842
01:45:30,899 --> 01:45:33,060
you're "dickson"...

843
01:45:33,202 --> 01:45:34,999
It should be decent.

844
01:45:35,237 --> 01:45:37,034
You're "dickson"

845
01:45:37,172 --> 01:45:39,834
I just wanted to speak faster.
I am sorry.

846
01:45:39,975 --> 01:45:41,033
Decent.

847
01:45:43,078 --> 01:45:44,602
Again.

848
01:45:44,780 --> 01:45:46,645
No way, I have to deliver
something to the hospital.

849
01:45:46,782 --> 01:45:48,306
Look at his hand!

850
01:45:48,917 --> 01:45:50,316
His hand is right here.

851
01:45:50,686 --> 01:45:51,812
No!

852
01:45:51,954 --> 01:45:52,852
I said that's you,

853
01:45:52,988 --> 01:45:54,819
you don't have to move like that.

854
01:45:54,957 --> 01:45:56,618
I don't know.

855
01:45:57,393 --> 01:45:59,224
You can just put it here.
