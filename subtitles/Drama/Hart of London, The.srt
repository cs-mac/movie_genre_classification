1
00:00:01,646 --> 00:00:05,881
<i>Harley Wilkes was your father.
He left you his practice.</i>

2
00:00:05,882 --> 00:00:06,949
We are
at your engagement party.

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:08,751
You know how difficult
this is for me.

4
00:00:08,752 --> 00:00:10,352
Difficult never stopped me.

5
00:00:10,353 --> 00:00:12,054
<i>ON:
This needs to stop;
I can't handle it.</i>

6
00:00:12,055 --> 00:00:13,956
I'm trying to move on,
a-and you won't let me.

7
00:00:13,957 --> 00:00:15,824
<i>OE:
Judson-- he broke up with me.</i>

8
00:00:15,825 --> 00:00:18,325
Yeah, I heard. There
was a town pool-- when
y'all would break up--

9
00:00:18,326 --> 00:00:21,395
and I had, I had 100 bucks
on tonight.

10
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,697
I was trying to
get over someone,

11
00:00:22,698 --> 00:00:24,732
and I shouldn't have
dated, but I wanted to

12
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,233
<i>- because I liked you.
- No one knows
what's gonna happen</i>

13
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:27,669
<i>between two people.</i>

14
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,272
<i>Until yesterday
I was having such a good time.</i>

15
00:00:36,343 --> 00:00:38,078
Good morning,
Zoe Hart.

16
00:00:41,449 --> 00:00:43,483
You, uh, want
some coffee?

17
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:50,222
I get it, you're probably trying
to cut back on the caffeine.

18
00:00:50,223 --> 00:00:52,157
You seemed a little wired
recently, Doc.

19
00:00:52,158 --> 00:00:54,159
What's that?

20
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,997
Oh, corn flakes.

21
00:00:57,998 --> 00:01:00,299
Yeah, oh, they
do look good.

22
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,500
I'll have some, too.

23
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:03,703
I love me some corn flakes.

24
00:01:03,704 --> 00:01:04,936
You do?

25
00:01:04,937 --> 00:01:05,937
You love corn flakes?

26
00:01:05,938 --> 00:01:07,005
I do, yeah.

27
00:01:07,006 --> 00:01:09,140
Great.

28
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,814
Oops.

29
00:01:15,815 --> 00:01:17,749
Oh, here, enjoy
your breakfast.

30
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:21,184
So I take it you're
still mad at me

31
00:01:21,185 --> 00:01:24,521
for the whole breaking
you and Judson up thing?

32
00:01:29,794 --> 00:01:32,596
So Agnes is baking us a bunch
of sample wedding cakes.

33
00:01:32,597 --> 00:01:34,431
She's going to bake us
caramel chocolate cake,

34
00:01:34,432 --> 00:01:35,666
a chocolate
sour cream cake.

35
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:37,533
Wait a minute, I thought
you wanted lemon cake.

36
00:01:37,534 --> 00:01:39,502
Honey, I know how much
you like your chocolate.

37
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,142
You would give up
your signature fruit for me?

38
00:01:46,143 --> 00:01:48,277
George Tucker, I'd give
up anything for you.

39
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,313
Thank you.

40
00:01:51,314 --> 00:01:53,081
Give me that-- no, I'm okay.

41
00:01:53,082 --> 00:01:54,716
So, what are
you doing today?

42
00:01:54,717 --> 00:01:57,953
Ooh, I am driving to
Mobile to pick out fabrics

43
00:01:57,954 --> 00:01:59,821
for the bridesmaids' dresses,
I'm meeting with the caterer,

44
00:01:59,822 --> 00:02:01,890
I'm going to reconfirm our
block of rooms at the inn,

45
00:02:01,891 --> 00:02:03,224
and I'm gonna find
Pete Terwilliger

46
00:02:03,225 --> 00:02:04,392
and get him to fix that
wedding invitation typo.

47
00:02:04,393 --> 00:02:05,527
Okay, okay,
you know what?

48
00:02:05,528 --> 00:02:07,529
That-That's, that's
way too much stuff.

49
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,963
Why don't,
why don't you go ahead

50
00:02:08,964 --> 00:02:11,966
and save that for Saturday,
and I can go with you?

51
00:02:11,967 --> 00:02:15,435
And, I don't know,
you can take today off.

52
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:17,404
I cannot take the day off.

53
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:19,406
Lemon, now that I know what
you've been dealing with--

54
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:22,009
finding your mother
with another family and...

55
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,045
I get why you've
been stressed out,

56
00:02:24,046 --> 00:02:28,081
but, baby, let's face it, you
need to blow off some steam,

57
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:30,449
so...

58
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,319
I... guess I can
use a break.

59
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,954
So why don't you go ahead
and give me that to-do list

60
00:02:34,955 --> 00:02:35,955
that I know you got
in your ourse?

61
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:39,258
Your list,
the one in your purse.
I don't...

62
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:40,826
I know there's one
in there.
That's weird, it's not there.

63
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,061
You got a list in there--
I know you do.

64
00:02:42,062 --> 00:02:44,596
All right...
great, great.

65
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:46,665
Okay, as of right now...

66
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,567
the only thing
on this list...

67
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:53,271
...is to relax
and have fun.

68
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:58,442
Yes, relax, have
fun-- I can do that.

69
00:02:58,443 --> 00:03:00,044
All right, I love you, babe.

70
00:03:00,045 --> 00:03:01,278
Love you.

71
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:04,182
She's gonna blow.

72
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:06,017
Any minute.

73
00:03:07,485 --> 00:03:09,620
It worked this morning.

74
00:03:09,621 --> 00:03:11,989
Huh, mm.

75
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,990
Ain't that
always the way?

76
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:15,826
Something seems to be
working perfectly,

77
00:03:15,827 --> 00:03:19,196
then all of a sudden,
it's not.

78
00:03:19,197 --> 00:03:22,799
One minute, you and the
volcano are rock solid.

79
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,301
The next minute, the volcano
won't even return your calls.

80
00:03:25,302 --> 00:03:26,837
Okay, Lavon,

81
00:03:26,838 --> 00:03:29,438
so far today I have heard you
compare Didi to a volcano,

82
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:32,007
a bowl of grits, and Dash's
pet cockatoo Pickles.

83
00:03:32,008 --> 00:03:34,043
No, no, no,
I said Didi

84
00:03:34,044 --> 00:03:35,410
wasn't like Pickles
because Pickles knows

85
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:37,346
how to use a damn phone.

86
00:03:37,347 --> 00:03:38,680
I just don't get it.

87
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:40,549
Things were finally going well
with me and Didi.

88
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:44,586
Then she runs out,
won't return my calls.

89
00:03:44,587 --> 00:03:46,487
Well, at least you didn't take
your girl out line dancing,

90
00:03:46,488 --> 00:03:48,556
only to have her escape
out the bathroom window.

91
00:03:48,557 --> 00:03:50,792
And I'm a good dancer.

92
00:03:50,793 --> 00:03:52,994
Joelle climbed
out the bathroom window?

93
00:03:52,995 --> 00:03:54,695
When did that happen?

94
00:03:54,696 --> 00:03:55,797
Last night at
Tricky Rick's.

95
00:03:55,798 --> 00:03:58,532
Women-- why are they
so confusing?

96
00:03:58,533 --> 00:03:59,667
What we need...

97
00:03:59,668 --> 00:04:00,635
Hmm.

98
00:04:00,636 --> 00:04:01,701
...is some insight.

99
00:04:01,702 --> 00:04:03,036
Zoe.

100
00:04:03,037 --> 00:04:04,371
What, are you kidding me?

101
00:04:04,372 --> 00:04:06,240
She's the most confounding one
of 'em all.

102
00:04:06,241 --> 00:04:07,875
Still isn't talking to me just
'cause I put a little wager

103
00:04:07,876 --> 00:04:10,844
on her breaking up with, uh--
what's his name?

104
00:04:10,845 --> 00:04:12,212
Judson.
Yeah.

105
00:04:13,347 --> 00:04:14,414
Hello, Lavon.

106
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:18,017
Lavon, I'll see you later.

107
00:04:18,018 --> 00:04:21,053
Bye.

108
00:04:21,054 --> 00:04:22,855
Listen, Zoe,
I, I need a favor.

109
00:04:22,856 --> 00:04:24,123
Anything.
Well,

110
00:04:24,124 --> 00:04:27,693
as you may know, uh,
Didi and I had a...

111
00:04:27,694 --> 00:04:29,095
romantic encounter

112
00:04:29,096 --> 00:04:30,997
after the
Sweetie Pie dance.

113
00:04:30,998 --> 00:04:32,131
Then, all of a sudden,
she said

114
00:04:32,132 --> 00:04:34,499
she wasn't feeling well
and she left.

115
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,834
Now she won't answer
the phone.

116
00:04:35,835 --> 00:04:37,269
Well, did you do something
to make her angry?

117
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,004
Can you find out for me?

118
00:04:39,005 --> 00:04:42,941
Well, you know, relationships
aren't really my forte.

119
00:04:42,942 --> 00:04:44,042
Just ask Judson.

120
00:04:44,043 --> 00:04:45,811
Please.

121
00:04:45,812 --> 00:04:49,546
For you, my best friend
in BlueBell, I will try.

122
00:04:49,547 --> 00:04:50,647
Ah, thank you.

123
00:04:50,648 --> 00:04:52,183
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

124
00:04:52,184 --> 00:04:54,218
I will take you to the Rammer
Jammer tonight to thank you.

125
00:04:54,219 --> 00:04:56,120
You take me to the Rammer
Jammer almost every night.

126
00:04:56,121 --> 00:04:59,423
Yes, but tonight
I will let you pay.

127
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,590
Ooh.

128
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:01,425
<i>AN:
Come experience</i>

129
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,295
the wonders of science.

130
00:05:04,296 --> 00:05:05,361
Mr. Sunberg.

131
00:05:05,362 --> 00:05:07,163
George.
Hey.

132
00:05:07,164 --> 00:05:08,865
Who are you today?

133
00:05:08,866 --> 00:05:10,066
Y-You-You're
Copernicus.

134
00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:11,567
You're Galileo.

135
00:05:11,568 --> 00:05:13,402
Hey, stick around,
you might relearn something.

136
00:05:14,905 --> 00:05:16,272
Gather round, everyone,

137
00:05:16,273 --> 00:05:18,708
gather round,
for I have a rather

138
00:05:18,709 --> 00:05:21,844
weighty subject
that I'd like to discuss.

139
00:05:21,845 --> 00:05:24,079
I am speaking, of
course, about...

140
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,048
gravity.

141
00:05:26,049 --> 00:05:29,117
Mr. Sunberg,
Dash Dewitt for the Blawker,

142
00:05:29,118 --> 00:05:31,253
BlueBell's number one
online gossip site.

143
00:05:31,254 --> 00:05:32,554
<i>We did The Odd Couple
together, Dash,</i>

144
00:05:32,555 --> 00:05:33,621
I know who you are.

145
00:05:33,622 --> 00:05:35,023
Right.

146
00:05:35,024 --> 00:05:37,391
Well, I just have a few
questions about this experiment

147
00:05:37,392 --> 00:05:38,559
that you and your
wife are conducting

148
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,760
later on tonight
in the town square.

149
00:05:39,761 --> 00:05:41,229
I understand

150
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,698
that you're attempting
to communicate with aliens.

151
00:05:45,834 --> 00:05:47,668
Uh, that's really none
of your business, Dash

152
00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:49,470
The experiment we're
conducting is personal.

153
00:05:49,471 --> 00:05:50,537
It doesn't
concern you.

154
00:05:50,538 --> 00:05:52,106
Oh, really?

155
00:05:52,107 --> 00:05:56,843
A teacher who believes he talks
to aliens doesn't concern me?

156
00:05:56,844 --> 00:05:57,978
Well, uh,

157
00:05:57,979 --> 00:05:59,612
my beliefs are not relevant.

158
00:05:59,613 --> 00:06:02,048
If you're telling the aliens
to touch down in BlueBell,

159
00:06:02,049 --> 00:06:03,917
I think the people have
a right to know.

160
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:05,685
Look, Dash,
I am not talking to the aliens.

161
00:06:05,686 --> 00:06:06,953
They are talking to me!

162
00:06:09,822 --> 00:06:12,291
Say what?

163
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I just can't
believe it.

164
00:06:21,001 --> 00:06:22,234
I mean, the man
seriously thinks

165
00:06:22,235 --> 00:06:24,669
that aliens are really trying
to talk to him.

166
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:26,704
Yeah, well, I can't say
it surprises me.

167
00:06:26,705 --> 00:06:28,072
Man's been two bricks
short of a load

168
00:06:28,073 --> 00:06:30,508
ever since he married
that crazy-pants wife of his.

169
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:31,842
Yeah.

170
00:06:31,843 --> 00:06:33,278
Women sure do have a way
of ruining things,

171
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:35,246
don't they?

172
00:06:35,247 --> 00:06:36,647
I guess that depends
on the woman.

173
00:06:36,648 --> 00:06:38,349
Speaking of which...

174
00:06:39,785 --> 00:06:44,654
Oh, hey, Joelle, you are
looking lovely today.

175
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:46,924
I'll, uh, talk to
you later, Wade.

176
00:06:49,127 --> 00:06:50,460
What are you doing
here, Joelle,

177
00:06:50,461 --> 00:06:52,095
looking for another window
to climb out?

178
00:06:52,096 --> 00:06:54,932
I know you're mad, okay,
but I had a real good reason

179
00:06:54,933 --> 00:06:56,266
for jumping out that
window last night.

180
00:06:56,267 --> 00:06:57,900
Oh, do tell.

181
00:06:57,901 --> 00:06:58,667
I'm on the run.

182
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,236
From who?

183
00:07:00,237 --> 00:07:01,503
My ex-boyfriend Ed.

184
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,439
See, things
didn't exactly

185
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,143
end well between us, and I
sort of set his lawn on fire.

186
00:07:07,144 --> 00:07:08,978
You, you sort of set
his lawn on fire?

187
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:10,346
I didn't mean to,

188
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,747
but, you know, with the
dry season and all...

189
00:07:11,748 --> 00:07:13,514
Anyway,

190
00:07:13,515 --> 00:07:17,685
Ed got his pal the sheriff to
issue a warrant for my arrest,

191
00:07:17,686 --> 00:07:19,020
so I hightailed
it to Georgia,

192
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,288
which is where I'm
supposed to be right now.

193
00:07:20,289 --> 00:07:22,857
So why do you have
to leave?

194
00:07:22,858 --> 00:07:24,759
'Cause last night Ed
came into Tricky Rick's,

195
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,527
and I think he saw me,

196
00:07:26,528 --> 00:07:28,129
so now that he's
on my trail again,

197
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:31,598
he's not gonna stop till he
finds me and puts me in jail.

198
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,233
I'm sorry, Wade.

199
00:07:33,234 --> 00:07:35,135
I really thought we could
have been something.

200
00:07:35,136 --> 00:07:37,271
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
now hold on a minute, hold on.

201
00:07:37,272 --> 00:07:39,073
If he only caught
a glimpse of you,

202
00:07:39,074 --> 00:07:40,574
he can't be sure
what he saw,

203
00:07:40,575 --> 00:07:43,210
so all we got to do is
find the guy and, uh,

204
00:07:43,211 --> 00:07:44,845
convince him
it wasn't you.
Sweetie,

205
00:07:44,846 --> 00:07:46,412
you don't want to get
mixed up in this.

206
00:07:46,413 --> 00:07:47,713
Ed finds out you're
involved with me

207
00:07:47,714 --> 00:07:49,115
and he will be
all over you.

208
00:07:49,116 --> 00:07:51,050
Trust me, okay,
look, just, uh,

209
00:07:51,051 --> 00:07:52,918
just go back
over to my place,

210
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:55,621
hide out,
and I'll figure this out.

211
00:07:58,658 --> 00:07:59,592
Okay.
Okay.

212
00:07:59,593 --> 00:08:00,593
Thanks, Wade.

213
00:08:00,594 --> 00:08:01,593
All right.

214
00:08:01,594 --> 00:08:03,295
Mmm.

215
00:08:09,402 --> 00:08:11,403
Lemon is set
on having dinner served,

216
00:08:11,404 --> 00:08:13,338
but then people got
to wait for their food

217
00:08:13,339 --> 00:08:15,140
and there's not enough time
for dancing.

218
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:16,108
Know what I mean?

219
00:08:16,109 --> 00:08:18,009
It's true, dancing is fun.

220
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,610
Yeah, but then, you know,
if we have a buffet,

221
00:08:19,611 --> 00:08:21,645
then people-- they got,
they got to wait in line,

222
00:08:21,646 --> 00:08:22,613
so...

223
00:08:22,614 --> 00:08:24,015
People hate lines.

224
00:08:24,016 --> 00:08:25,149
Yeah, they...

225
00:08:26,684 --> 00:08:28,952
Oh, hey, Zoe, what
are you doing here?

226
00:08:28,953 --> 00:08:30,287
Uh, well,
since Addy and Brick

227
00:08:30,288 --> 00:08:32,289
are doing
a mobile vaccine clinic,

228
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,290
Tom Long is filling in
at the reception desk.

229
00:08:35,592 --> 00:08:37,394
This has to be the
highlight of his year.

230
00:08:37,395 --> 00:08:39,396
That's exactly what he wrote
in his e-mail to me.

231
00:08:39,397 --> 00:08:41,697
Well, you are more than
welcome to hide out here

232
00:08:41,698 --> 00:08:44,034
as long as you need to.

233
00:08:44,035 --> 00:08:46,269
Thanks, pal,
I appreciate the safe haven.

234
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:49,571
George, George,
school board just fired me.

235
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:51,040
All the man did
was tell the truth.

236
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:54,576
He is a vehicle for
extraterrestrial contact.

237
00:08:54,577 --> 00:08:56,245
Don't worry, Dotty,
George is gonna fix this.

238
00:08:56,246 --> 00:08:57,179
Aren't you,
George?

239
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,580
Uh, y-yeah.

240
00:08:58,581 --> 00:09:01,083
Yeah, I'm going to,
I'm going to do my...

241
00:09:01,084 --> 00:09:02,884
You know what? This
is probably a talk

242
00:09:02,885 --> 00:09:04,619
we should have
in my office.

243
00:09:11,626 --> 00:09:16,163
It's always interesting
around here.

244
00:09:16,164 --> 00:09:17,164
You know
what's interesting?

245
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:23,236
This Kardashian sister.

246
00:09:23,237 --> 00:09:24,538
Yep.

247
00:09:24,539 --> 00:09:26,506
She finally connects
with someone,

248
00:09:26,507 --> 00:09:29,977
thinks things are going great
when suddenly...

249
00:09:29,978 --> 00:09:32,045
he doesn't call her.

250
00:09:32,046 --> 00:09:33,345
Poor Kardashian.

251
00:09:33,346 --> 00:09:35,715
Actually, Khloe is
very happily married,

252
00:09:35,716 --> 00:09:38,284
but I see
your point.

253
00:09:38,285 --> 00:09:40,787
Okay, I have to
tell someone.

254
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,255
Yes, I'm
ignoring Lavon,

255
00:09:43,256 --> 00:09:45,058
but you would, too, if
you knew what I know.

256
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:46,992
Please don't tell me it's
some weird, kinky sex thing.

257
00:09:46,993 --> 00:09:49,561
It's worse.

258
00:09:49,562 --> 00:09:53,131
I found this hidden
under his desk.

259
00:09:53,132 --> 00:09:56,468
Under his desk?
Hidden.

260
00:09:56,469 --> 00:09:57,836
He told me recently
that he's hung up

261
00:09:57,837 --> 00:10:00,171
on someone, and I think
that someone is Lemon.

262
00:10:00,172 --> 00:10:01,974
Shh.
What should I do?

263
00:10:01,975 --> 00:10:03,540
Should I
tell George?

264
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:06,077
That poor, sweet man is
planning their wedding.

265
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:09,313
Wait, don't tell
anyone anything, okay?

266
00:10:09,314 --> 00:10:11,983
I'm sure that there's a
logical explanation for this.

267
00:10:13,485 --> 00:10:15,519
I'm gonna find out
what it is.

<i>AN:
Look, I'd be perfectly willing</i>

270
00:10:34,503 --> 00:10:36,503
to write
the grant proposal myself,

271
00:10:36,504 --> 00:10:39,206
but time is running out.

272
00:10:39,207 --> 00:10:41,374
Okay, okay, so we'll call
an emergency session

273
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,644
of the town council
and have it approved.

274
00:10:43,645 --> 00:10:45,145
I'm sure we can
get that...
Lavon!

275
00:10:45,146 --> 00:10:46,146
Oh.

276
00:10:46,147 --> 00:10:49,249
Hi, um, can I have a quick word?

277
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,317
Zoe, I'm in a meeting.

278
00:10:50,318 --> 00:10:51,584
It's important.

279
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:53,285
It's about that fruit problem
we're having.

280
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:56,856
Our oranges,
especially our Lemons.

281
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:03,029
Uh, I'll be
right back.

282
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,798
What do you mean
talking about lemons?

283
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:07,265
Didi has been

284
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,567
avoiding me because
she found this...

285
00:11:09,568 --> 00:11:11,870
hidden under your desk.

286
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:14,640
Oh, my God.

287
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,708
I forgot that
was under there.

288
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,110
What was it doing there, Lavon?

289
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:19,611
Please tell me
it doesn't mean

290
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:22,114
what I think it might.

291
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:24,682
Look, Zoe, just
forget you saw this...

292
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:28,019
Forget? You have a picture
of Lemon hidden in your office,

293
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,954
which indicates more than
a mayoral relationship.

294
00:11:29,955 --> 00:11:31,922
And I don't hear any denials.

295
00:11:31,923 --> 00:11:34,224
I-It's over.

296
00:11:34,225 --> 00:11:36,527
"It's over"?

297
00:11:36,528 --> 00:11:37,928
Wait, you mean, like,

298
00:11:37,929 --> 00:11:39,595
<i>it was not over?
It was a thing?</i>

299
00:11:39,596 --> 00:11:40,664
You and Lemon?

300
00:11:41,999 --> 00:11:43,166
Oh, my God.

301
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:44,834
Does George know?

302
00:11:44,835 --> 00:11:47,871
No. And he can't know.

303
00:11:47,872 --> 00:11:50,406
No one can ever know.
But Didi already does.

304
00:11:50,407 --> 00:11:53,409
Mayor... Mayor Hayes,
we've got a deadline.

305
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,777
Right. I'm-I'm sorry.
I'm coming.

306
00:11:54,778 --> 00:11:56,178
All right.

307
00:11:57,413 --> 00:11:59,447
Okay, l-look, Zoe, I'm...

308
00:11:59,448 --> 00:12:01,717
I am gonna tell you everything,
I want to tell you everything,

309
00:12:01,718 --> 00:12:04,286
but right now you have got
to cover with Didi. Please.

310
00:12:04,287 --> 00:12:06,588
I can't just lie to her.
This gets out,
it will hurt

311
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:08,123
a whole lot of good
people, myself included.

312
00:12:08,124 --> 00:12:09,958
I'm sorry for putting
you in this position,

313
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:11,192
but you have got
to keep this secret.

314
00:12:11,193 --> 00:12:13,594
You don't know what
you're asking me.

315
00:12:13,595 --> 00:12:15,462
Zoe, as your friend,
I'm begging you. Please.

316
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,300
Okay.

317
00:12:20,736 --> 00:12:22,170
Thank you.

318
00:12:24,073 --> 00:12:25,807
Okay, uh...

319
00:12:27,241 --> 00:12:29,176
<i>IC:
Look, George, I know</i>

320
00:12:29,177 --> 00:12:31,644
this may sound crazy, and
I don't blame you for being

321
00:12:31,645 --> 00:12:34,414
a nonbeliever-- I was a
nonbeliever before I met Dotty.

322
00:12:34,415 --> 00:12:37,584
But a year ago, I convinced him
to come to Roswell with me

323
00:12:37,585 --> 00:12:39,052
and participate
in this experiment...

324
00:12:39,053 --> 00:12:40,987
And the very next night
I had a dream

325
00:12:40,988 --> 00:12:42,788
that I was taken up into space.

326
00:12:42,789 --> 00:12:44,156
<i>He thought
he had a dream.</i>

327
00:12:44,157 --> 00:12:45,524
And then about
a month later,

328
00:12:45,525 --> 00:12:46,726
I started having
these episodes

329
00:12:46,727 --> 00:12:48,660
where I would lose
control of my tongue,

330
00:12:48,661 --> 00:12:50,529
like somebody was trying
to talk through me,

331
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:52,198
and my arms
would go numb.

332
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:54,200
It's like they're trying
to talk to us in code.

333
00:12:54,201 --> 00:12:55,968
Okay.

334
00:12:55,969 --> 00:12:57,236
Have you...

335
00:12:57,237 --> 00:12:59,137
considered
a medical explanation?

336
00:12:59,138 --> 00:13:02,874
Of course. I've been
to Mobile, and I went
to doctor after doctor,

337
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:05,076
but no one could find
the explanation

338
00:13:05,077 --> 00:13:07,045
as to what was
happening with me.
Eric can't

339
00:13:07,046 --> 00:13:10,048
really be fired
for his beliefs, can he?

340
00:13:10,049 --> 00:13:12,416
If he kept them to himself,

341
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:14,318
no, he couldn't be.

342
00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:15,953
But unfortunately,

343
00:13:15,954 --> 00:13:18,021
he talked about them
at an official school function.

344
00:13:18,022 --> 00:13:21,658
George, you know
what teaching means to me.

345
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:24,027
There has to be

346
00:13:24,028 --> 00:13:25,729
something you can do.

347
00:13:36,473 --> 00:13:38,808
Hey, sweetheart.
Almost finished?

348
00:13:38,809 --> 00:13:40,309
I'm sorry to have
to do this to you, baby,

349
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:42,044
but I'm gonna have
to cancel dinner tonight.

350
00:13:42,045 --> 00:13:43,813
I've got to mount an entire
defense to the school board

351
00:13:43,814 --> 00:13:45,347
for Eric Sunberg
by 10:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

352
00:13:45,348 --> 00:13:47,849
Oh, it's okay.
Don't you worry about me.

353
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,217
Okay.

354
00:13:49,218 --> 00:13:51,586
How's the day of fun going?

355
00:13:51,587 --> 00:13:54,689
<i>So good.
I'm having the best time.</i>

356
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:55,824
Ah.

357
00:13:55,825 --> 00:13:57,225
Right.

358
00:13:57,226 --> 00:13:59,060
What are you doing right now?

359
00:14:00,296 --> 00:14:02,264
Picking bridesmaids' fabrics.

360
00:14:02,265 --> 00:14:03,831
Lemon!

361
00:14:03,832 --> 00:14:06,600
Oh, Lemon,
I am disappointed, okay?

362
00:14:06,601 --> 00:14:09,069
You were supposed
to be relaxing.

363
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:11,071
Fine, George, fine.

364
00:14:11,072 --> 00:14:15,442
Next time you see me,
I will be so relaxel,

365
00:14:15,443 --> 00:14:18,545
you'll just think that
I've joined a reggae band.

366
00:14:21,048 --> 00:14:25,018
So, did you talk to Lavon?

367
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:27,053
I didn't need to.

368
00:14:27,054 --> 00:14:29,189
Look, Didi,

369
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:32,959
the truth is...
the picture's mine.

370
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,460
I-I took it
from Lemon's house

371
00:14:34,461 --> 00:14:36,428
when I was trying
to be a Belle.

372
00:14:36,429 --> 00:14:38,063
Yours?

373
00:14:38,064 --> 00:14:40,866
Well, why didn't you say
so in the first place?

374
00:14:40,867 --> 00:14:44,303
Because...
I was embarrassed.

375
00:14:44,304 --> 00:14:47,005
Thank you. I've been wanting
to fit in to BlueBell,

376
00:14:47,006 --> 00:14:50,042
and I figured Lemon,
queen of this town, was key.

377
00:14:50,043 --> 00:14:53,510
And if I studied her--
the way she did her hair

378
00:14:53,511 --> 00:14:56,247
and how she dressed-- then
maybe I could fit in, too.

379
00:14:56,248 --> 00:14:58,316
You haven't done anything
at all to be like her.

380
00:14:58,317 --> 00:15:00,417
I tried.

381
00:15:00,418 --> 00:15:02,286
In my house,

382
00:15:02,287 --> 00:15:03,855
by myself.

383
00:15:03,856 --> 00:15:05,756
Then I realized
it was futile,

384
00:15:05,757 --> 00:15:07,757
you know, because Lemon...

385
00:15:07,758 --> 00:15:09,625
well, she's perfect,

386
00:15:09,626 --> 00:15:11,328
and I could never achieve

387
00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:12,863
that level of wonderfulness.

388
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:16,499
'Cause, you know,

389
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,701
she's so pretty
with that blonde hair.

390
00:15:18,702 --> 00:15:22,405
But why'd you hide the
picture under Lavon's desk?

391
00:15:22,406 --> 00:15:24,340
Well...

392
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:27,642
I was looking at it,
like I do, in Lavon's study

393
00:15:27,643 --> 00:15:29,845
when I thought I
heard someone coming.

394
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,881
So I hid it.

395
00:15:31,882 --> 00:15:34,917
Because, you know, I don't
want anyone to know--
especially Lemon.

396
00:15:34,918 --> 00:15:37,819
Because of what I said--
you know, she's so perfect,

397
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,120
so pretty.

398
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,857
I think I get it.

399
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,225
This happened

400
00:15:44,226 --> 00:15:47,295
with my cousin Donna
and her gym teacher.

401
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:50,098
And I am so glad

402
00:15:50,099 --> 00:15:51,900
you feel you could
confide in me.

403
00:15:53,068 --> 00:15:54,568
Thank you.

404
00:15:54,569 --> 00:15:56,469
I'm just so relieved!
Now things can

405
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,305
finally get back to normal--
'cause I didn't know

406
00:15:58,306 --> 00:16:00,107
how I was gonna keep
working at that office

407
00:16:00,108 --> 00:16:03,043
knowing this terrible secret
about George's fiancée.

408
00:16:03,044 --> 00:16:06,146
Yeah, that would've been hard.
He's the sweetest
man I've ever known.

409
00:16:06,147 --> 00:16:07,714
Besides Lavon.
And I don't think

410
00:16:07,715 --> 00:16:10,650
I could've lived with myself
had I kept it from him.

411
00:16:10,651 --> 00:16:14,186
You know?
Well, lucky for you,
you don't have to.

412
00:16:14,187 --> 00:16:16,655
Hey, you two.
Hey,

413
00:16:16,656 --> 00:16:17,990
George!
You still
hiding out

414
00:16:17,991 --> 00:16:18,990
from, uh, Tom?

415
00:16:18,991 --> 00:16:20,491
Yeah.

416
00:16:20,492 --> 00:16:22,093
I should get back, though.

417
00:16:22,094 --> 00:16:23,728
It was good to see you.
Good-bye.

418
00:16:25,064 --> 00:16:27,532
Okay. See ya.

419
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,940
Oh, yeah.

420
00:16:41,446 --> 00:16:45,149
YOGA TEACHER
In Warrior pose.

421
00:16:48,219 --> 00:16:49,686
No.

422
00:16:49,687 --> 00:16:52,188
No, the seafood option
should be local.

423
00:16:52,189 --> 00:16:54,090
YOGA TEACHER
Cartwheel down...

424
00:16:54,091 --> 00:16:56,625
into Plank pose.

425
00:16:59,863 --> 00:17:01,764
Ugh!

426
00:17:01,765 --> 00:17:04,100
Lemon, what is wrong with you?

427
00:17:10,139 --> 00:17:13,908
It is just so great
to finally see you in action.

428
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:16,011
Doing your doctor thing.

429
00:17:16,012 --> 00:17:17,779
Just restocking
the shelves.

430
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,648
Uh, yeah, well, you're
doing it super awesomely.

431
00:17:20,649 --> 00:17:22,650
You think

432
00:17:22,651 --> 00:17:26,187
<i>I'm doing a good job?
Well, yeah,
sure, I guess.</i>

433
00:17:26,188 --> 00:17:29,423
You're answering the
phones, and you got me
that coffee that I wanted.

434
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:31,492
Oh... oh, I forgot.

435
00:17:31,493 --> 00:17:34,295
Uh, you missed a phone call
from George Tucker

436
00:17:34,296 --> 00:17:35,729
a while ago.
What?

437
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,431
What did you tell him?

438
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:40,300
That... you...
weren't here.

439
00:17:40,301 --> 00:17:41,501
Oh, good.

440
00:17:41,502 --> 00:17:42,902
That is good.

441
00:17:42,903 --> 00:17:43,836
Whew!
Always tell George

442
00:17:43,837 --> 00:17:46,139
that I'm not here, okay?

443
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,108
Zoe Hart left the building.

444
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,379
Hey, Zoe? Um,

445
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,514
this is... this is
Eric and Dotty Sunberg,

446
00:17:54,515 --> 00:17:57,849
and... we have a little bit
of a situation here.

447
00:18:01,754 --> 00:18:05,057
The board refused to drop
the charges, but I figure

448
00:18:05,058 --> 00:18:07,226
if I can prove that there's
a medical explanation for it,

449
00:18:07,227 --> 00:18:09,361
I might be able
to get him his job back.

450
00:18:09,362 --> 00:18:12,163
I'll get a history on him
and I'll run some tests.

451
00:18:12,164 --> 00:18:13,898
Call you later.
Or better yet, e-mail.

452
00:18:13,899 --> 00:18:16,534
I-I know Mr. Sunberg can
be a little bit kooky,

453
00:18:16,535 --> 00:18:19,803
but he made a major
impact on my life.

454
00:18:19,804 --> 00:18:22,573
So I... just want to
thank you for doing this.

455
00:18:22,574 --> 00:18:24,409
I knew I could
count on you.

456
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,676
You're a... you're
a really great friend.

457
00:18:27,845 --> 00:18:30,313
You, too. I'm
sure that you have
a ton of work to do,

458
00:18:30,314 --> 00:18:33,016
so I'll see you around.
Oh, don't worry about me--
I'm gonna be here

459
00:18:33,017 --> 00:18:34,317
until we find out
what's wrong with him.

460
00:18:37,188 --> 00:18:38,621
Okay.

461
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:48,026
The initial test
results are in,

462
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:50,394
and everything confirms what
the doctors in Mobile found.

463
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:53,030
Mr. Sunberg
is perfectly healthy.

464
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:55,967
Even the mental evaluation
didn't raise any flags.

465
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,035
Yeah, you see, George?
No earthly explanation.

466
00:18:58,036 --> 00:19:00,604
Am I the only one
who just got chills?

467
00:19:00,605 --> 00:19:03,374
Dr. Hart, can we have just a...
just a quick word?

468
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,541
I'd rather we didn't.
What?

469
00:19:04,542 --> 00:19:07,410
What? Nothing.

470
00:19:07,411 --> 00:19:09,079
So what's our
next step here?

471
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,048
I mean, CT scan
or an MRI or...?

472
00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:14,284
Well, he's already had all
those tests done in Mobile.

473
00:19:14,285 --> 00:19:17,354
Maybe you should consider
that Mr. Sunberg made
the whole thing up.

474
00:19:17,355 --> 00:19:19,122
Why would he make it up?
Maybe the story

475
00:19:19,123 --> 00:19:21,590
<i>makes him a celebrity
at Star Trek conventions.</i>

476
00:19:21,591 --> 00:19:22,758
I don't know, George.

477
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:24,894
Sometimes people just lie.

478
00:19:24,895 --> 00:19:27,930
Even the people we think
we know and like.

479
00:19:29,732 --> 00:19:31,600
Th-Th-The aliens are talking.

480
00:19:38,974 --> 00:19:41,209
Right pupil is nonreactive.

481
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:44,345
You can't fake
nonreactive pupils.

482
00:19:44,346 --> 00:19:45,914
<i>So I guess he's not lying.</i>

483
00:19:48,417 --> 00:19:50,184
<i>DE:
No, Joelle,</i>

484
00:19:50,185 --> 00:19:52,353
you do not have
to shave your head.

485
00:19:53,654 --> 00:19:55,355
Or leave town.

486
00:19:55,356 --> 00:19:58,425
Look, just let me
figure this out, okay?

487
00:19:58,426 --> 00:20:00,193
Bartender?

488
00:20:00,194 --> 00:20:02,662
I will have a mint julep,
please.

489
00:20:05,733 --> 00:20:08,668
What? It's a perfectly
respectable drink.

490
00:20:08,669 --> 00:20:10,937
Yeah. If you're a hundred.

491
00:20:10,938 --> 00:20:12,905
Lemon...

492
00:20:12,906 --> 00:20:15,141
what are you doing here,
middle of the day?

493
00:20:15,142 --> 00:20:17,843
Shouldn't you be off,
you know, bossing someone
around somewhere?

494
00:20:19,179 --> 00:20:21,780
I... took the day off.

495
00:20:21,781 --> 00:20:23,615
Day off from what?

496
00:20:23,616 --> 00:20:25,216
Very funny.

497
00:20:26,352 --> 00:20:28,219
George made me.

498
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,288
"Relax, have fun,"
he said, you know?

499
00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:32,290
But I couldn't,
Wade, I couldn't.

500
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:35,126
Lying there doing
nothing just made my
brain go into hyper-drive,

501
00:20:35,127 --> 00:20:38,729
and it just made me
more stressed out
than I already was.

502
00:20:41,066 --> 00:20:43,567
Oh, I didn't order this.
Yeah, well,

503
00:20:43,568 --> 00:20:46,203
mint julep won't
cure what ails you.

504
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:49,106
Lemon, you know
how to have fun.

505
00:20:49,107 --> 00:20:52,142
All you got to do is,
you know... let go.

506
00:20:52,143 --> 00:20:53,777
Can't.

507
00:20:53,778 --> 00:20:56,847
Turns out Lemon Breeland
is just as anal and uptight

508
00:20:56,848 --> 00:20:58,747
as everyone thinks.

509
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:03,052
Well, then...

510
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:06,922
maybe you should stop being
Lemon Breeland for a night.

511
00:21:14,698 --> 00:21:15,931
Wade.

512
00:21:15,932 --> 00:21:17,132
Wade!
Hmm?

513
00:21:17,133 --> 00:21:18,601
Wade!
What?

514
00:21:21,436 --> 00:21:24,305
No one's ever gonna
believe I'm Joelle.

515
00:21:24,306 --> 00:21:26,407
Look at me.

516
00:21:26,408 --> 00:21:28,309
I am.

517
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:30,612
You look exactly
like Joelle.

518
00:21:30,613 --> 00:21:32,046
Damn, woman, you're hot!

519
00:21:32,047 --> 00:21:33,214
Shut up.

520
00:21:33,215 --> 00:21:34,516
I will not.

521
00:21:34,517 --> 00:21:35,517
Come on, let's go.

522
00:21:36,684 --> 00:21:38,552
Mmm! Rrr! Mmm!

523
00:21:44,859 --> 00:21:46,393
Hey, Zoe...

524
00:21:46,394 --> 00:21:48,395
Didi came over and apologized.

525
00:21:48,396 --> 00:21:49,863
We're back together.

526
00:21:49,864 --> 00:21:51,398
Fantastic.

527
00:21:51,399 --> 00:21:52,698
Hey, Zoe,
um... Oh.

528
00:21:52,699 --> 00:21:54,199
Sorry, I didn't...

529
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,068
realize you had company.
Hey, Lavon.

530
00:21:56,069 --> 00:21:58,004
I'll just...

531
00:21:58,005 --> 00:22:00,873
And George--
you remember George, right?

532
00:22:00,874 --> 00:22:02,675
Sweetest man in town?
Look, Zoe,

533
00:22:02,676 --> 00:22:04,844
um...

534
00:22:04,845 --> 00:22:07,246
I'd like to tell you everything.

535
00:22:07,247 --> 00:22:08,980
Can we please just

536
00:22:08,981 --> 00:22:11,716
take a walk and talk?

537
00:22:11,717 --> 00:22:13,484
I'm not in the mood to talk.

538
00:22:13,485 --> 00:22:16,855
I've already lied to Didi,
I'm lying to George.

539
00:22:16,856 --> 00:22:19,090
You've put me
in a terrible position.

540
00:22:22,261 --> 00:22:23,562
Thanks, Lavon.

541
00:22:23,563 --> 00:22:25,262
Thanks a lot.

542
00:22:36,567 --> 00:22:37,868
Anything?

543
00:22:37,869 --> 00:22:38,769
Unfortunately, no.

544
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,270
Zoe, come on.

545
00:22:40,271 --> 00:22:41,071
Hello!

546
00:22:41,072 --> 00:22:42,640
I brought snacks.

547
00:22:42,641 --> 00:22:45,976
In honor of our Zoe's
cultural heritage... bagels!

548
00:22:45,977 --> 00:22:47,677
Or biscuits with
the middle cut out.

549
00:22:47,678 --> 00:22:48,511
Well, it looks
delicious,

550
00:22:48,512 --> 00:22:49,612
Tom, thank you so much.

551
00:22:52,883 --> 00:22:54,917
You really are a nice
guy, aren't you?

552
00:22:54,918 --> 00:22:56,285
Honey, you should

553
00:22:56,286 --> 00:22:57,887
eat and drink something, too,
what with all that blood

554
00:22:57,888 --> 00:22:59,122
they took.

555
00:22:59,123 --> 00:23:00,389
Dotty, you got to get going

556
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,624
if you're gonna conduct
the experiment.

557
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:02,824
I'll be back

558
00:23:02,825 --> 00:23:04,760
as soon as I get
the data we need.

559
00:23:04,761 --> 00:23:05,994
But drink your juice.

560
00:23:05,995 --> 00:23:07,763
All right.

561
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:13,769
Mr. Sunberg, do you
drink juice often?

562
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:15,170
I do.

563
00:23:15,171 --> 00:23:17,572
May I?

564
00:23:17,573 --> 00:23:21,575
That tattoo, it's fading.

565
00:23:21,576 --> 00:23:22,943
Where did you get it?

566
00:23:22,944 --> 00:23:24,378
Well, I got that
on my wedding day.

567
00:23:24,379 --> 00:23:26,346
We were down in this
tiny town in Mexico.

568
00:23:26,347 --> 00:23:28,282
You know, it seemed
like the thing to do.

569
00:23:28,283 --> 00:23:30,718
Actually kind of gives me a
tough-guy rep with the kids,

570
00:23:30,719 --> 00:23:31,919
which is cool.

571
00:23:33,722 --> 00:23:36,489
I have a feeling it may have
given you more than that.

572
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,491
I think your tattoo may have
given you lead poisoning.

573
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,401
Stop, stop, stop.

574
00:23:48,402 --> 00:23:49,569
This is a bad idea.

575
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,803
We're gonna get found out.

576
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,237
We're gonna get
ourselves killed.

577
00:23:52,238 --> 00:23:54,973
Lemon, you've watched too
many Patrick Swayze movies.

578
00:23:54,974 --> 00:23:56,241
Now, you were
the one who said

579
00:23:56,242 --> 00:23:57,743
you didn't want to be
Lemon for a night.

580
00:23:57,744 --> 00:23:59,178
Well, this is your chance.

581
00:24:01,047 --> 00:24:02,447
Lemon,

582
00:24:02,448 --> 00:24:04,717
we're in Fairhope; nobody
knows who you are.

583
00:24:04,718 --> 00:24:06,018
They don't?

584
00:24:06,019 --> 00:24:07,518
You know, I don't like
the sound of that.

585
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:08,920
I bet they've heard of me, okay?

586
00:24:08,921 --> 00:24:10,988
No. Look, all we
need to do is find

587
00:24:10,989 --> 00:24:13,457
this Ed guy, and then convince
him that you were the one

588
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:15,093
who was here with
me last night, okay?

589
00:24:15,094 --> 00:24:17,161
Then you can go home
and you can make lists

590
00:24:17,162 --> 00:24:18,395
and you can order
people around

591
00:24:18,396 --> 00:24:20,431
or whatever it is that
you do to have fun.

592
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,600
No, no, what, what...

593
00:24:23,601 --> 00:24:24,901
Lemon, Lemon.

594
00:24:24,902 --> 00:24:26,136
What?

595
00:24:26,137 --> 00:24:27,971
You are no longer
uptight Lemon Breeland.

596
00:24:27,972 --> 00:24:29,773
You are super fun

597
00:24:29,774 --> 00:24:31,507
Roxy Rumley.
Yeah, who
apparently isn't

598
00:24:31,508 --> 00:24:34,144
scared of getting hepatitis.

599
00:24:34,145 --> 00:24:36,479
Yo, Bobby, beer me.

600
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,714
Sure thing, Ed, my boy.

601
00:24:42,585 --> 00:24:44,686
And, uh, we'll take two
down here.

602
00:24:44,687 --> 00:24:49,058
Hey, weren't you
in here last night

603
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:50,893
with a girl named Joelle?

604
00:24:50,894 --> 00:24:54,596
Well, you're right that I was
here, uh, last night, but, uh...

605
00:24:54,597 --> 00:24:56,197
But my sugar lips
was with me.

606
00:24:56,198 --> 00:24:57,198
Hm?

607
00:24:57,199 --> 00:24:58,299
And my name is Roxy.

608
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,168
Yes, it is.

609
00:25:00,169 --> 00:25:01,502
Roxy.

610
00:25:01,503 --> 00:25:02,403
Mm-hmm.

611
00:25:05,174 --> 00:25:07,142
My mistake.

612
00:25:07,143 --> 00:25:09,043
Y'all have a good night now.

613
00:25:09,044 --> 00:25:10,844
It happens; take it easy.

614
00:25:13,848 --> 00:25:15,715
Sugar lips?

615
00:25:15,716 --> 00:25:17,885
Oh, my God, just tried to
think of, like, something

616
00:25:17,886 --> 00:25:19,552
I would never say
in a million years,

617
00:25:19,553 --> 00:25:21,255
and "sugar lips"
just kind of came right out.

618
00:25:21,256 --> 00:25:22,656
It was just so spontaneous!

619
00:25:22,657 --> 00:25:24,992
Just so exciting.

620
00:25:24,993 --> 00:25:26,359
The good news is,
I think he bought it.

621
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:27,426
We can split.

622
00:25:27,427 --> 00:25:29,328
Wait.

623
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:30,997
You know what else Lemon
really would never do?

624
00:25:30,998 --> 00:25:32,832
I really don't want to know.

625
00:25:32,833 --> 00:25:34,233
Shots with Wade Kinsella.
Bobby!

626
00:25:34,234 --> 00:25:35,534
Line them up!

627
00:25:38,005 --> 00:25:42,008
The chelation challenge
confirms it.

628
00:25:42,009 --> 00:25:43,208
Lead poisoning.

629
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:44,642
You are so smart.

630
00:25:44,643 --> 00:25:46,044
How did you know?

631
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:49,214
Well, juice can have
traces of lead.

632
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:50,949
For most people,
it's no problem.

633
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:53,551
But for someone whose body is
already filled with toxins

634
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,821
from a lead tattoo, it can

635
00:25:55,822 --> 00:25:57,355
exacerbate the symptoms.
Say it again.

636
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:03,027
The good news is that lead
poisoning is easily treatable,

637
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:04,962
so, Mr.Sunberg,
you should be fine.

638
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:06,130
The good news

639
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:07,631
for you is that lead can cause

640
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:09,433
any number
of neurological symptoms.

641
00:26:09,434 --> 00:26:11,936
Like making you believe that you
were being controlled by aliens.

642
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:12,769
Wait, what?
Look,

643
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:14,138
all we got to do is tell

644
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:16,706
the school board that you
had a medical condition.

645
00:26:16,707 --> 00:26:20,310
And as long as you promise not
to talk about UFOs and the like

646
00:26:20,311 --> 00:26:21,444
at any school functions,

647
00:26:21,445 --> 00:26:23,980
then we're gonna get
you your job back.

648
00:26:23,981 --> 00:26:26,082
So, you're telling me
that there is no chance at all

649
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:29,352
that my spells were caused
by extraterrestrials?

650
00:26:29,353 --> 00:26:31,453
You are 100% alien-free.

651
00:26:33,622 --> 00:26:35,824
Zoe, thank you so much.

652
00:26:35,825 --> 00:26:37,926
Yeah.

653
00:26:39,628 --> 00:26:40,996
I'm gonna go get some dinner,

654
00:26:40,997 --> 00:26:43,631
and then I will be back
in a while to check on you.

655
00:26:43,632 --> 00:26:46,034
George, I'm sure you
have to hurry off

656
00:26:46,035 --> 00:26:48,569
and go write some torts
or briefs or something.

657
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:49,636
See you.

658
00:26:56,979 --> 00:26:58,612
Hey, Zoe.

659
00:26:58,613 --> 00:27:00,181
Hey, wait up.

660
00:27:00,182 --> 00:27:01,382
Hey!

661
00:27:01,383 --> 00:27:03,049
Jeez, I didn't realize
how fast you walked

662
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,284
with those little
legs of yours.

663
00:27:04,285 --> 00:27:07,254
Oh, you know us New Yorkers.

664
00:27:07,255 --> 00:27:09,189
Hey, George, I got
your Save the Date.

665
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,423
I'll see you there.
Oh. Great.

666
00:27:10,424 --> 00:27:12,725
I'll see you there.

667
00:27:12,726 --> 00:27:15,262
So, your Save the
Dates went out, huh?

668
00:27:15,263 --> 00:27:17,697
That's why you've been acting
so strange today, isn't it?

669
00:27:17,698 --> 00:27:18,964
What?

670
00:27:18,965 --> 00:27:20,366
You didn't get a
Save the Date.

671
00:27:20,367 --> 00:27:21,901
Um, I am so sorry.

672
00:27:21,902 --> 00:27:24,003
Oh, yeah, that's-that's
why I've been weird.

673
00:27:24,004 --> 00:27:25,504
Look, Zoe.

674
00:27:25,505 --> 00:27:28,640
I really want you to know that
I do consider you a friend.

675
00:27:28,641 --> 00:27:30,910
It's just, the wedding,
you know, is...

676
00:27:30,911 --> 00:27:34,313
I just want that to be
Lemon's special day.

677
00:27:34,314 --> 00:27:35,914
I hope you understand.

678
00:27:35,915 --> 00:27:38,783
So, you guys are doing
well, then, huh?

679
00:27:38,784 --> 00:27:40,818
Yeah, we're doing great.

680
00:27:40,819 --> 00:27:42,520
Actually, I mean,

681
00:27:42,521 --> 00:27:44,655
we had a rough patch after
the holidays, but she finally

682
00:27:44,656 --> 00:27:46,590
told me about some things
that had been going on.

683
00:27:46,591 --> 00:27:47,825
Really?

684
00:27:47,826 --> 00:27:49,193
She told you some things?

685
00:27:49,194 --> 00:27:52,796
Yeah. Yeah, she had, um...

686
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:54,398
some problems with her family.

687
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,800
And, you know, she'd
been dealing with that,

688
00:27:56,801 --> 00:27:58,435
but then she finally
decided to tell me,

689
00:27:58,436 --> 00:28:00,270
and now that she has,

690
00:28:00,271 --> 00:28:01,939
it's brought us
a lot closer, you know,

691
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:04,174
and being a lawyer, I see
people split up all the time,

692
00:28:04,175 --> 00:28:06,176
you know, because they can't
be open with their partners.

693
00:28:06,177 --> 00:28:08,911
So, it feels good, to know that
we're gonna walk down the aisle

694
00:28:08,912 --> 00:28:10,846
without a secret
between us, you know?

695
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:16,284
I'm really happy for you.

696
00:28:16,285 --> 00:28:19,521
Oh, sorry.

697
00:28:19,522 --> 00:28:22,023
Wade.

698
00:28:22,024 --> 00:28:23,325
Hi, Wade.

699
00:28:24,794 --> 00:28:26,862
Wait, who's-who's Roxy?

700
00:28:26,863 --> 00:28:27,896
Wait, what are
you talking...

701
00:28:27,897 --> 00:28:29,431
What? No, don't, just...

702
00:28:29,432 --> 00:28:30,998
You just, you stay there.

703
00:28:30,999 --> 00:28:33,434
You st... I'll be right there!
I'm sorry, I got to go.

704
00:28:33,435 --> 00:28:35,402
Uh, we'll talk
tomorrow? Yeah?

705
00:28:35,403 --> 00:28:36,170
Okay.
Okay.

706
00:28:58,892 --> 00:29:01,728
This is George Tucker;
please leave a message.

707
00:29:01,729 --> 00:29:04,997
Hey, George, it's Zoe.

708
00:29:04,998 --> 00:29:07,033
Can you call me
when you have a chance?

709
00:29:07,034 --> 00:29:09,768
There's something
I need to tell you.

710
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,394
Okay, you know, time to go.

711
00:29:37,395 --> 00:29:38,796
Why? This is so fun.

712
00:29:38,797 --> 00:29:40,497
I'm having so much fun.

713
00:29:40,498 --> 00:29:41,865
Lemon, you're drunk, okay?

714
00:29:41,866 --> 00:29:42,966
Who's Lemon?

715
00:29:42,967 --> 00:29:44,167
My name is Roxy.

716
00:29:44,168 --> 00:29:46,169
And Roxy wants
one more dance.

717
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:50,106
You get one more dance, one
more, and then we're leaving.

718
00:29:50,107 --> 00:29:51,141
All right?

719
00:29:51,142 --> 00:29:52,308
Thank you, sugar lips.

720
00:29:52,309 --> 00:29:53,910
Whatever.

721
00:29:59,448 --> 00:30:01,583
How are you feeling?

722
00:30:01,584 --> 00:30:03,718
De-alienated.

723
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:05,754
Hey, can I ask you a favor?

724
00:30:05,755 --> 00:30:06,989
Sure.

725
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:08,690
Well, if my wife asks,

726
00:30:08,691 --> 00:30:10,025
don't tell her that
it was the tattoo

727
00:30:10,026 --> 00:30:11,459
that gave me lead poisoning.

728
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:14,195
I don't have to tell her
anything you don't want me to.

729
00:30:14,196 --> 00:30:15,462
But why?

730
00:30:15,463 --> 00:30:17,431
I'm going to tell her
that it was

731
00:30:17,432 --> 00:30:19,533
an extraterrestrial
implantation device

732
00:30:19,534 --> 00:30:20,835
that gave me
lead poisoning,

733
00:30:20,836 --> 00:30:22,036
and that you
removed it

734
00:30:22,037 --> 00:30:23,704
and gave it to
the authorities.

735
00:30:23,705 --> 00:30:25,439
Why would you do that?

736
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,142
Dr. Hart, I know
our beliefs may sound silly.

737
00:30:28,143 --> 00:30:32,245
They sounded silly to me...
before I met Dotty.

738
00:30:32,246 --> 00:30:34,747
And then she sold me.

739
00:30:34,748 --> 00:30:37,550
Believing something
else is out there--

740
00:30:37,551 --> 00:30:39,352
it's what makes

741
00:30:39,353 --> 00:30:41,387
Dotty and me us.

742
00:30:41,388 --> 00:30:43,824
We're happy.

743
00:30:43,825 --> 00:30:47,426
So, if a little lie
keeps us going,

744
00:30:47,427 --> 00:30:48,427
you know,
who's to say that's wrong?

745
00:30:53,533 --> 00:30:57,970
You know, you should be
real thankful you got Roxy

746
00:30:57,971 --> 00:30:59,138
and not Joelle.

747
00:30:59,139 --> 00:31:01,240
'Cause that girl is crazy.

748
00:31:01,241 --> 00:31:04,742
I was all set to
propose and everything,

749
00:31:04,743 --> 00:31:07,278
and then she saw me talking
to my female neighbor,

750
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,314
talking, and that crazy girl

751
00:31:09,315 --> 00:31:11,049
set my clothes on fire.

752
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:13,818
But you got a keeper
here, my friend.

753
00:31:13,819 --> 00:31:15,586
To Roxy!

754
00:31:15,587 --> 00:31:17,421
To Roxy.

755
00:31:25,864 --> 00:31:28,732
Thank you, Lemon.

756
00:31:28,733 --> 00:31:32,002
You were... You went
above and beyond.

757
00:31:34,571 --> 00:31:36,005
You deserve better, you know.

758
00:31:36,006 --> 00:31:38,607
What are you talking about?

759
00:31:38,608 --> 00:31:40,843
I'm talking about Joelle.

760
00:31:40,844 --> 00:31:43,846
Burning a man's clothes
'cause she was jealous?

761
00:31:43,847 --> 00:31:45,982
Yeah, she's real
classy with a K.

762
00:31:45,983 --> 00:31:49,752
Well, thank you, uh,
but you're drunk.

763
00:31:49,753 --> 00:31:51,819
I am.

764
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:56,524
But drunk or not,
Wade, I know you.

765
00:31:56,525 --> 00:31:59,727
We were friends once,
in high school.

766
00:31:59,728 --> 00:32:04,032
I always thought that you'd
rise above your upbringing

767
00:32:04,033 --> 00:32:07,067
and have a life as
big as your heart.

768
00:32:07,068 --> 00:32:11,071
I believe that
you deserve better,

769
00:32:11,072 --> 00:32:13,340
even if you think you don't.

770
00:32:20,081 --> 00:32:22,415
Oh, what?

771
00:32:22,416 --> 00:32:25,785
"Achy Breaky Heart" look out!

772
00:32:25,786 --> 00:32:27,320
Whoo!

773
00:32:42,468 --> 00:32:44,502
You have got to help me.

774
00:32:44,503 --> 00:32:46,671
Okay? I cannot get her
off the dance floor .
I bet.

775
00:32:46,672 --> 00:32:49,408
And she's, no, she's
gonna blow our cover.

776
00:32:49,409 --> 00:32:50,475
George, just remember
to call her...

777
00:32:50,476 --> 00:32:52,844
Roxy. Roxy, I got it.

778
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:55,579
Oh, Georgie!

779
00:32:57,782 --> 00:32:59,984
Roxy, I think it's time
about time to go home.

780
00:32:59,985 --> 00:33:01,419
Let's just go, let's go.
Oh, come on.

781
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,154
Just do one dance with me.

782
00:33:03,155 --> 00:33:05,756
Hey, everyone, this
is my fiancé, George!

783
00:33:05,757 --> 00:33:08,259
Wait. I thought
she's with you.

784
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,126
Well, see that's an
interesting question.

785
00:33:10,127 --> 00:33:11,727
Uh, it's-it's a
bit complicated.

786
00:33:11,728 --> 00:33:13,496
Wait a minute.
You're George Tucker.

787
00:33:13,497 --> 00:33:17,033
You defended my cousin
last year for tax evasion.

788
00:33:17,034 --> 00:33:18,768
Uh...

789
00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:21,704
Yeah. Nice
to see you.

790
00:33:21,705 --> 00:33:23,539
See, my fiancé-- he's a genius.

791
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,841
Okay?

792
00:33:24,842 --> 00:33:26,375
You should come to our wedding!
Shouldn't he?

793
00:33:26,376 --> 00:33:27,943
I mean, y'all should come
to our wedding.

794
00:33:27,944 --> 00:33:28,743
What? Wedding?

795
00:33:28,744 --> 00:33:30,346
Yeah.

796
00:33:30,347 --> 00:33:31,180
Oh, you lying
son of a...

797
00:33:31,181 --> 00:33:32,314
Okay, run! Run!

798
00:33:32,315 --> 00:33:33,849
Run! Run! Run!
Come on, come on!

799
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,755
Okay, look, you can tell
whoever you want to,

800
00:33:40,756 --> 00:33:44,025
but please, first,
let me explain.

801
00:33:44,026 --> 00:33:46,861
I'm not sure I want to hear
the sordid details, Lavon.

802
00:33:46,862 --> 00:33:48,696
It wasn't sordid.

803
00:33:50,032 --> 00:33:51,565
We were in love.

804
00:33:52,767 --> 00:33:55,336
You were in love?

805
00:33:55,337 --> 00:33:58,138
At least I was.

806
00:33:58,139 --> 00:34:01,941
It started
around Christmas

807
00:34:01,942 --> 00:34:04,044
last year.

808
00:34:04,045 --> 00:34:05,945
Lemon was going
through a hard time,

809
00:34:05,946 --> 00:34:07,946
George was in New York,

810
00:34:07,947 --> 00:34:10,483
and I was just trying
to be a good friend.

811
00:34:10,484 --> 00:34:12,651
But then,
something happened.

812
00:34:12,652 --> 00:34:14,853
We just...

813
00:34:14,854 --> 00:34:16,855
ran to each other
like it was home.

814
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:21,093
We would, uh, just

815
00:34:21,094 --> 00:34:23,061
get in the car
and just drive,

816
00:34:23,062 --> 00:34:24,896
no idea where we were going.

817
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:26,664
Sometimes we'd end up
at the beach,

818
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:28,799
sometimes the woods,
sometimes

819
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,202
some small town.

820
00:34:31,203 --> 00:34:33,905
<i>For the first
and only time</i>

821
00:34:33,906 --> 00:34:36,774
in my life I was in love,
and, uh...

822
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:39,709
I saw a future
with us together.

823
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,912
So, what happened?

824
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:46,550
Six weeks in,
George came home...

825
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:49,386
unexpectedly,

826
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:51,088
and I was

827
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,990
sure she was gonna
tell him the truth,

828
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:57,693
that things were over
between them.

829
00:34:57,694 --> 00:35:00,296
But she didn't.

830
00:35:00,297 --> 00:35:02,365
He proposed,

831
00:35:02,366 --> 00:35:06,902
and she chose George...
instead of me.

832
00:35:06,903 --> 00:35:08,637
I'm sorry.

833
00:35:08,638 --> 00:35:10,439
And my heart broke.

834
00:35:11,974 --> 00:35:13,208
My God.

835
00:35:13,209 --> 00:35:15,444
Yeah, I don't know.
I mean, maybe, uh,

836
00:35:15,445 --> 00:35:17,512
she made the right decision.

837
00:35:17,513 --> 00:35:20,782
I mean, they-they...
they seem happy together.

838
00:35:20,783 --> 00:35:23,618
They do.

839
00:35:25,688 --> 00:35:30,124
Okay, look, if you... if you
need to tell George the truth...

840
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:31,959
I'll understand.

841
00:35:33,795 --> 00:35:36,029
Do whatever
you think is right.

842
00:35:50,043 --> 00:35:51,744
Hello.

843
00:35:51,745 --> 00:35:54,847
Hey, Zoe. Um, sorry it took me
so long to get back to you.

844
00:35:54,848 --> 00:35:56,516
What was it
you needed to tell me?

845
00:35:56,517 --> 00:35:58,283
Yeah, George, um...

846
00:36:01,221 --> 00:36:03,922
If Mrs. Sunberg asks,

847
00:36:03,923 --> 00:36:05,957
can you tell her

848
00:36:05,958 --> 00:36:09,461
the lead poisoning came
from an alien implant?

849
00:36:11,464 --> 00:36:13,632
Well, okay, then.

850
00:36:15,867 --> 00:36:18,636
I'll see you tomorrow.

851
00:36:18,637 --> 00:36:20,538
Okay.

852
00:36:20,539 --> 00:36:22,373
Bye.

853
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,308
How'd it go?

854
00:36:35,309 --> 00:36:36,976
Did you find Ed?

855
00:36:36,977 --> 00:36:38,644
Yeah. Yeah, I found him.

856
00:36:38,645 --> 00:36:41,481
Had a nice little chat, too.

857
00:36:43,584 --> 00:36:47,519
Tell me again why you, uh,
why you burned his lawn?

858
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,288
What did he tell you?
Enough.

859
00:36:49,289 --> 00:36:52,357
Look, Joelle, I...

860
00:36:52,358 --> 00:36:54,426
I think maybe you ought to, uh,

861
00:36:54,427 --> 00:36:56,995
head back to Georgia after all.

862
00:36:56,996 --> 00:36:58,863
You're breaking up with me?

863
00:36:58,864 --> 00:37:01,499
Yup.

864
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,634
Yeah, I am.

865
00:37:03,635 --> 00:37:05,236
Just need a little less crazy
in my life right now.

866
00:37:05,237 --> 00:37:06,370
Crazy?!

867
00:37:06,371 --> 00:37:07,838
Um...

868
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:09,673
I'll show you crazy!
Now, now, hold on.

869
00:37:09,674 --> 00:37:10,808
That might not have
been the word I was...

870
00:37:10,809 --> 00:37:12,143
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.
Do not...

871
00:37:12,144 --> 00:37:13,377
Oh, my God.

872
00:37:13,378 --> 00:37:14,678
You... No.

873
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:16,747
No, do not smash that!

874
00:37:16,748 --> 00:37:18,248
Oh, I'm not
gonna smash it.

875
00:37:18,249 --> 00:37:20,050
Don't worry.
Put the lighter down.

876
00:37:20,051 --> 00:37:21,251
- Say good-bye!
- Lighter down!

877
00:37:21,252 --> 00:37:23,020
I'd love for you
to try...

878
00:37:23,021 --> 00:37:24,955
That's my favorite...
Don't you call me crazy!

879
00:37:24,956 --> 00:37:26,657
Maybe we should
go help him?

880
00:37:26,658 --> 00:37:29,359
No, I think Wade can
take care of himself.

881
00:37:31,429 --> 00:37:32,929
What about you?
How you feeling?

882
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:34,597
You need, uh...
you need aspirin?

883
00:37:34,598 --> 00:37:36,398
Mm, no, I feel great.

884
00:37:36,399 --> 00:37:38,034
Oh.
Feel electric.

885
00:37:38,035 --> 00:37:39,301
Oh. Oh.

886
00:37:39,302 --> 00:37:41,104
Okay.

887
00:37:41,105 --> 00:37:43,172
My God, it has been so long

888
00:37:43,173 --> 00:37:45,274
since I have just
let loose like that.

889
00:37:45,275 --> 00:37:47,977
I had no idea
how much I needed it.

890
00:37:50,212 --> 00:37:51,680
Thank you.

891
00:37:51,681 --> 00:37:53,581
Oh, no, don't thank me.

892
00:37:53,582 --> 00:37:56,484
I just really simply
said, uh, "Relax."

893
00:37:56,485 --> 00:37:59,254
I didn't say, "Get sloppy
drunk and go dancing

894
00:37:59,255 --> 00:38:02,190
under a fake name at a
roadhouse with Wade Kinsella."

895
00:38:03,459 --> 00:38:04,892
Well, you know me.

896
00:38:04,893 --> 00:38:08,462
I never do anything halfway.

897
00:38:08,463 --> 00:38:10,798
Yeah.

898
00:38:10,799 --> 00:38:14,669
Well, I guess, tomorrow,
it's back to real life.

899
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,707
I guess so.

900
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:27,013
Well, I, for one,

901
00:38:27,014 --> 00:38:30,684
am not ready to say good-bye
to Roxy Rumley just yet.

902
00:38:30,685 --> 00:38:32,418
Hmm.

903
00:38:32,419 --> 00:38:34,453
What are you
thinking about?

904
00:38:34,454 --> 00:38:39,024
Well, why don't you follow me
and find out?

905
00:38:55,741 --> 00:38:57,842
Hey, Dr. Hart!

906
00:38:57,843 --> 00:38:59,844
Thanks for all
your help.

907
00:38:59,845 --> 00:39:01,879
Too bad the Feds
showed up so soon

908
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,981
and took that device away.

909
00:39:03,982 --> 00:39:06,350
I know. Damn Feds!

910
00:39:24,602 --> 00:39:25,868
Hey.

911
00:39:27,037 --> 00:39:28,904
Hey.

912
00:39:31,141 --> 00:39:34,777
You know, I realize
that I can never presume

913
00:39:34,778 --> 00:39:36,712
to know what makes
a couple tick.

914
00:39:36,713 --> 00:39:41,149
Maybe George and Lemon
will live happily ever after,

915
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,951
and the secret
will never come out.

916
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:47,288
All I know is,
it's not my place to tell him.

917
00:39:52,427 --> 00:39:54,796
I'm sorry I ever put you
in this position.

918
00:39:54,797 --> 00:39:57,364
You're in a tough position, too.

919
00:39:57,365 --> 00:39:58,732
Yeah.

920
00:39:58,733 --> 00:40:01,769
Can't be easy to see
the two of them together.

921
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:03,804
No.

922
00:40:03,805 --> 00:40:06,306
Do you still love her?

923
00:40:07,508 --> 00:40:09,843
Sometimes I think I might.

924
00:40:12,147 --> 00:40:14,380
Sometimes I think I'm over it.

925
00:40:16,784 --> 00:40:19,485
All I know--
I... I'm just trying to move on.

926
00:40:48,713 --> 00:40:51,248
Oh, this is
the best day ever!

927
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:54,618
I didn't think
about anything.

928
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:56,253
I just was totally
in the moment.

929
00:40:56,254 --> 00:40:57,988
I just went where
the day took me.

930
00:40:57,989 --> 00:40:59,990
I wish every day
could be like this.

931
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:03,059
Oh, George,
we're not even 30 years old.

932
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,862
We have the whole world right
in... right in front of us.

933
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:07,997
Why don't we just be
running hell-bent towards it?

934
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:10,033
We shouldn't be sitting here,
waiting and planning.

935
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:11,367
That's not life, George.

936
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:12,936
This is life.

937
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:14,637
You and me, right here,

938
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,672
right now.

939
00:41:16,673 --> 00:41:19,007
What are you saying?

940
00:41:19,008 --> 00:41:22,044
Let's elope.

941
00:41:24,714 --> 00:41:26,281
Really?

942
00:41:26,282 --> 00:41:27,850
Yeah.

943
