1
00:01:03,458 --> 00:02:14,999
Cows!

2
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,499
Donkeys!

3
00:03:53,292 --> 00:04:06,916
No doggies!

4
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,624
No.

5
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,124
Mummy!

6
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,124
Güera.

7
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:53,707
Moon.

8
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,207
Home.

9
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,999
Eleazar.

10
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:56,624
Daddy.

11
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:58,749
Rut. Eleazar.

12
00:07:04,417 --> 00:07:05,791
My mummy.

13
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:05,332
Mummy!

14
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,124
Hello, dear. Good morning.

15
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,582
Softly, darling.
Eleazar's still sleeping.

16
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:11,166
..nimals.

17
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,166
Animals?

18
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,249
Did you dream of animals?

19
00:18:19,792 --> 00:18:23,041
- Was it the giraffe, your favourite?
- Yes.

20
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:26,416
- Or was it cows, my love?
- Out.

21
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,249
Do you want to come out, sweetie?

22
00:18:29,792 --> 00:18:31,791
Let me just pick up this mess.

23
00:18:38,042 --> 00:18:40,082
Mummy.

24
00:18:40,167 --> 00:18:42,041
What's Mummy's name, darling?

25
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:45,582
Natalia.

26
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,457
Come on. Look who's sleeping there.

27
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:51,624
- Who?
- Who's sleeping there?

28
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:56,582
- Who?
- Who's sleeping there? Who is he?

29
00:18:56,667 --> 00:18:58,082
- Who is he?
- Who?

30
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,041
Shall we wake him up?

31
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:05,416
No. No.

32
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:09,124
- Don't you want to wake him up?
- No.

33
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,582
Here I am!

34
00:19:13,667 --> 00:19:16,916
Look who's here! Eleazar.

35
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:19,457
Eleazar is here, dear.

36
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,707
Did you see that?

37
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:24,291
Naughty boy.

38
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,124
Wake up! Wake up!

39
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,749
Eleazar.

40
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,207
What's the matter
with this noisy family?

41
00:19:32,292 --> 00:19:34,707
Now you're getting a good tickling!

42
00:19:34,792 --> 00:19:36,541
Stop it! Stop it!

43
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,957
My little meatball!

44
00:19:39,042 --> 00:19:42,207
Did you sleep well?

45
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,082
Do you want a crane?

46
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:55,041
You're getting an extra tickling.

47
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,041
Stop it! Stop it!

48
00:20:02,042 --> 00:20:04,957
- Do you want it in a cup?
- No, no, in a bottle.

49
00:20:05,042 --> 00:20:06,999
Hang on, let me explain.

50
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,207
Mum didn't prepare any bottles.

51
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,874
Cos... Cos sometimes I do this...

52
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,791
I want water.

53
00:20:23,708 --> 00:20:26,957
- Good morning, Jarro!
- Good morning, Juan.

54
00:20:27,042 --> 00:20:31,082
Jarrito, can I borrow your camera again?
I need to take...

55
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:32,499
Bela, Güera!

56
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,291
Come here, dogs! Bela!

57
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,207
Let me come over, Juan.

58
00:20:38,292 --> 00:20:40,332
Apple! Hurry up!

59
00:20:40,417 --> 00:20:41,999
Bela!

60
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,041
Come here, dogs. Bela, come here.

61
00:20:45,917 --> 00:20:47,666
Where were you?

62
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:48,999
Güera.

63
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,291
Apple...

64
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,332
I was calling you and you didn't come.

65
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:57,832
And you? I didn't see you all night.

66
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,707
You too, naughty.

67
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,124
Naughty, both of you.

68
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:08,707
Fuck...

69
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:10,916
Not again. Who did that?

70
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,124
Who was it?

71
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,707
Was it you, Martita?

72
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,624
Keep still! Keep still!

73
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:19,957
Keep still!

74
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,874
Why did you do that? Fucking bitch!

75
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:24,791
Don't bite me! Fucking dog!

76
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:26,082
Why d'you do that?

77
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,082
Keep still! Keep still, don't move!

78
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:31,499
Don't bite me, damn it!

79
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,082
You dirty bitch!

80
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,041
Why did you do that?

81
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,041
Don't move.

82
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,374
Don't bite me again!

83
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,082
Keep still!

84
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:45,332
Here!

85
00:21:50,292 --> 00:21:51,666
Stop it, Juan!

86
00:21:55,833 --> 00:21:56,999
Stop!

87
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,624
Just a second, Jarro.

88
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,082
OK, Juan.

89
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,166
Just some exercise with the dogs, son.

90
00:22:18,167 --> 00:22:19,416
Eleazar!

91
00:22:22,792 --> 00:22:24,541
Come here, my little cockroach!

92
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:27,916
You wretch, why do you run away?

93
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,082
I have to chase you
all around the house.

94
00:22:30,167 --> 00:22:31,707
Let's go see Jarro.

95
00:22:31,792 --> 00:22:33,124
Damned dogs!

96
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:34,749
They're so naughty.

97
00:22:35,292 --> 00:22:36,541
Listen,

98
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:40,916
I want to borrow your camera again.
The photos were all dark.

99
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,541
- Your camera is crap, man.
- That's odd.

100
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:45,916
It's a good camera. Three megapictures.

101
00:22:46,042 --> 00:22:48,832
- No way!
- Megapictures!

102
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:51,332
He got it in a cereal box.

103
00:22:51,417 --> 00:22:52,916
His... can you see?

104
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,541
Did you see the hummingbirds
this morning?

105
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,916
I did. They're beautiful.

106
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,916
There's birds everywhere.
Well, back to work and remember the...

107
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,291
- The camera. Bring it over.
- I'll go get it.

108
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:06,957
OK, thanks.

109
00:23:07,042 --> 00:23:08,749
Time for breakfast, little worm.

110
00:23:09,917 --> 00:23:11,541
Good afternoon, brothers.

111
00:23:11,625 --> 00:23:13,999
My name is Daniel Colorado.

112
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:17,749
Many of you know me as R2-D2.

113
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:24,624
I want to tell you about the harm
that I have caused to my family

114
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:29,957
as I led my nephew
when he was only ten years old

115
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:31,332
into alcoholism.

116
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,416
I've made the mistake of...
How do l say this?

117
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:41,749
Getting him wasted,
forcing him to drink.

118
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:43,416
I know that's wrong.

119
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,916
It's harmed the whole family.

120
00:23:48,542 --> 00:23:50,457
But, well, in a talk I'll give later,

121
00:23:50,542 --> 00:23:56,416
I'll give you more details
about how the AA group

122
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:00,291
can help us to correct...

123
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:03,749
..to correct this young man's...

124
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:08,374
..this young man's path.

125
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:12,166
Now that I've led him... astray.

126
00:24:13,042 --> 00:24:16,832
But as I said, I'll tell you
about that another time.

127
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:26,624
R2-D2, thanks for so kindly
sharing your experience with us.

128
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,832
Let's hear from The Toad
about his experience.

129
00:24:32,917 --> 00:24:34,541
Let's see what he says.

130
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:41,499
Good afternoon, everyone.
My name is José Luis Martínez Jiménez.

131
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:46,416
I fix and install
curtains, paint, plaster.

132
00:24:47,542 --> 00:24:49,624
My nickname is The Toad.

133
00:24:52,292 --> 00:24:54,874
I'm an honest worker.

134
00:24:54,958 --> 00:24:57,499
I make my money
with the sweat of my brow.

135
00:24:57,583 --> 00:24:59,832
I have to work hard to earn it.

136
00:24:59,917 --> 00:25:02,666
It's a shame that I waste it...

137
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,874
I waste it on...

138
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:12,374
..on prostitutes!

139
00:25:22,375 --> 00:25:25,666
And I think... I'm making progress, yes.

140
00:25:27,667 --> 00:25:31,249
Bit by bit, I'm leaving my vices behind,

141
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:35,874
such as alcohol, weed, coke,

142
00:25:35,958 --> 00:25:38,124
thanks to this group.

143
00:25:40,625 --> 00:25:46,291
I want to tell you
that I've earned my living honestly,

144
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:50,749
working as an ironsmith,
doing curtains, painting, plastering,

145
00:25:50,833 --> 00:25:52,499
even as a bricklayer.

146
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:54,374
But I've never seen my money.

147
00:25:54,458 --> 00:25:56,666
I always wake up without a cent.

148
00:25:59,083 --> 00:26:01,124
Thank you.

149
00:26:01,208 --> 00:26:02,624
Thanks, brother.

150
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:04,749
Who's next? Let's see...

151
00:26:04,833 --> 00:26:06,791
You, Seven!

152
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,124
Good afternoon, brothers.

153
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:15,207
Well, all of you know me already.

154
00:26:15,292 --> 00:26:17,041
They call me Seven.

155
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:21,666
Today, I brought a friend with me.

156
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,874
A guest, I suppose.

157
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:26,749
He's a friend of mine.
Well, he was my boss.

158
00:26:26,875 --> 00:26:28,999
Now I think of him as a friend...

159
00:26:29,083 --> 00:26:32,166
But... Well, I did some work
in his house.

160
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:36,166
I took care of the plumbing,
the electricity,

161
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:39,207
I installed plenty of cables,
only the best.

162
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:42,666
The best pipes.

163
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,374
Just Condumex, Nacobre.

164
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:49,541
He had installed a submersible
Grundfos pump, 1/2 hp,

165
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:51,374
Rexolite brand CPVC only

166
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:57,624
Plica tube, Liquatite tube,
RD26 for gas plumbing, L class.

167
00:26:57,708 --> 00:27:02,332
He also had PAR bulbs installed,
economy bulbs in his main patio,

168
00:27:02,417 --> 00:27:05,666
three-way switches,
three-phase contacts,

169
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,666
and LED bulbs so... Well...

170
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,916
So everything is well done
from start to finish!

171
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:18,041
Today he's joined us because he's got...
some worries, or he has... a problem.

172
00:27:18,125 --> 00:27:20,166
I invited him to come to the sessions.

173
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,541
He agreed to come
because he's interested.

174
00:27:23,292 --> 00:27:26,374
Everyone in the village knows him
or has seen him.

175
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:31,582
Juanito, a good guy
who wants to meet you all.

176
00:27:31,667 --> 00:27:35,707
Good morning.

177
00:27:35,792 --> 00:27:36,832
Good morning, sir.

178
00:27:38,125 --> 00:27:39,541
See you on Thursday.

179
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:41,416
- Goodbye, brothers.
- Goodbye.

180
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,749
- What do you think then, Juan?
- Let's wait till they leave...

181
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,666
See you tomorrow at seven!

182
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:51,457
Wait a sec, Juan. What?

183
00:27:51,542 --> 00:27:53,291
Tomorrow at seven!

184
00:27:53,417 --> 00:27:54,999
Yes, at seven.

185
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,832
OK, let's go now...

186
00:28:01,167 --> 00:28:02,957
No, sit down for a while.

187
00:28:10,667 --> 00:28:12,249
Sit down, Juan.

188
00:28:12,667 --> 00:28:14,166
What's up?

189
00:28:15,375 --> 00:28:17,041
So do you lend them this house?

190
00:28:18,208 --> 00:28:20,707
When I came up here,

191
00:28:20,792 --> 00:28:22,999
they lent me the land and I built it,

192
00:28:23,083 --> 00:28:24,791
but now I lend it to them.

193
00:28:24,875 --> 00:28:27,041
I don't make any money off it
or anything.

194
00:28:27,125 --> 00:28:30,374
- It's just to help them out.
- And now? Where do you live?

195
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:34,124
I've got a better house.
I just lived here when I arrived.

196
00:28:34,208 --> 00:28:35,957
How did you end up here?

197
00:28:37,458 --> 00:28:40,999
It's a long story, man,
but I'll make it short.

198
00:28:41,083 --> 00:28:42,166
Tell me, tell me...

199
00:28:43,292 --> 00:28:50,707
When I was a boy, about 13,
It was just another day in my house.

200
00:28:50,792 --> 00:28:55,624
I was sitting on the sofa watching TV,
and I heard noises from another room.

201
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:58,499
So I peeped in.

202
00:28:58,583 --> 00:29:01,999
There was my dad
and my 15-year-old sister having sex.

203
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:05,374
He was a fucking alcoholic.

204
00:29:05,458 --> 00:29:08,207
He left us, my mum, my brothers.

205
00:29:08,292 --> 00:29:10,749
He fucked off. They had a family.

206
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:14,457
I did everything I could
to fuck the idiot up,

207
00:29:14,542 --> 00:29:16,166
but I only fucked myself up.

208
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:19,332
I ended up on drugs, alcohol.

209
00:29:19,417 --> 00:29:21,041
I was a thief, too.

210
00:29:22,042 --> 00:29:23,749
Total fucking mess, my friend.

211
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,624
I also had a family.

212
00:29:27,708 --> 00:29:30,624
Haven't seen them since. I had kids.

213
00:29:30,708 --> 00:29:32,541
How come you didn't see them again?

214
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:37,082
I battered my wife, kids. I was cruel.

215
00:29:37,167 --> 00:29:40,749
I was alright,
but I was an alcoholic, a drug addict.

216
00:29:41,458 --> 00:29:43,541
They forced me into a clinic.

217
00:29:45,917 --> 00:29:47,832
I was there six, seven months.

218
00:29:48,708 --> 00:29:50,666
I don't know where they are now.

219
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:53,957
There was nothing left in the house,
not even a light bulb.

220
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:56,791
So I ended up here.

221
00:29:56,875 --> 00:29:58,916
Then I met these people and...

222
00:30:00,708 --> 00:30:04,166
..with the help of my godfather,
the group and God,

223
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,041
I hope to see them again one day.

224
00:30:19,417 --> 00:30:21,499
So what's your problem, Juanito?

225
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:26,249
Mine's not really a problem
compared to what I've just heard.

226
00:30:26,333 --> 00:30:30,166
Mine's just something small.
Have you ever heard of the internet?

227
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:33,249
That load of shit
of email and Bluetooth?

228
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:37,582
Yeah. You can find a lot of information
there, whatever you want.

229
00:30:37,667 --> 00:30:40,582
Even pornography. A lot of it.

230
00:30:40,667 --> 00:30:43,916
So, I got hooked
watching it at night.

231
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,416
Before going to sleep,
I have to go watch some,

232
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,749
otherwise I can't sleep
and can't even screw the wife, man.

233
00:30:50,833 --> 00:30:52,624
But it can be cured. Let's go now.

234
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:54,624
I'll walk you to your car.

235
00:30:54,708 --> 00:30:57,541
I've been doing this for eight years
and I've seen a lot.

236
00:30:57,625 --> 00:30:59,791
How long does each of
the 12 steps take?

237
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:01,374
C'mon, dogs!

238
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:03,791
One or two years.

239
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:06,582
What step are you on?

240
00:31:06,667 --> 00:31:08,416
To be honest, I'm on the first.

241
00:31:09,542 --> 00:31:10,874
Jesus, Seven!

242
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:47,207
No, girls, be careful!

243
00:32:49,875 --> 00:32:52,332
Careful! Don't point it at people!

244
00:32:52,417 --> 00:32:54,541
- Cheers!
- Cheers, cousin.

245
00:32:54,625 --> 00:32:58,291
Have you seen the coat
Achito's son's wearing?

246
00:32:58,375 --> 00:33:01,499
It's a little coat down to here.
It's blue. Fucking cool.

247
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:04,416
Business is bad, like everything else.

248
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,749
- Don't tell me...
- I do tell you.

249
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:09,749
Nothing is happening.
We're just sitting and waiting.

250
00:33:10,458 --> 00:33:11,832
Impatiently.

251
00:33:11,917 --> 00:33:15,166
Do you have a lighter
for the firecrackers?

252
00:33:15,292 --> 00:33:17,207
- No!
- But we'll get you one.

253
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:20,999
Hey, Lore.

254
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,874
Lorena has grown so much!

255
00:33:23,958 --> 00:33:25,082
- Hello!
- Uncle.

256
00:33:25,167 --> 00:33:28,124
Dude. How are you all? Merry Christmas.

257
00:33:28,208 --> 00:33:29,332
It's been ages!

258
00:33:29,417 --> 00:33:31,166
How are you?

259
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,791
It's been six months.

260
00:33:34,417 --> 00:33:36,582
- How are you, Uncle?
- Good. Good.

261
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,749
Eleazar!

262
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:41,749
- Hello.
- How are you?

263
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:44,707
- You're growing fast, man.
- Eleazar.

264
00:33:44,792 --> 00:33:47,582
- How are you?
- Where's your sister?

265
00:33:47,667 --> 00:33:50,249
- Rut!
- Where did you leave her?

266
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,166
Rut! Come here!

267
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:56,041
Hello, how are you, darling?
So nice to see you!

268
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:59,124
Eleazar and Rut, have you said hello
to great-grandma yet?

269
00:33:59,208 --> 00:34:00,332
- No.
- No.

270
00:34:00,417 --> 00:34:02,041
Well, go and say hello!

271
00:34:02,167 --> 00:34:03,332
Go say hello.

272
00:34:15,875 --> 00:34:17,832
What's up, Eleazar?

273
00:34:17,917 --> 00:34:18,957
Rut!

274
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:27,249
Aldrete family.

275
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:28,707
Who's next?

276
00:34:28,792 --> 00:34:33,707
Hey, children! Get together
according to you families.

277
00:34:33,792 --> 00:34:36,624
Very good, keep studying hard,

278
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:42,749
so you can grow up to be
a great businessman!

279
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:47,207
What do you want to do
when you grow up?

280
00:34:47,292 --> 00:34:48,832
I don't know.

281
00:34:48,917 --> 00:34:52,207
Start thinking! Use your head.

282
00:34:52,292 --> 00:34:54,166
Give Great-Grandma a kiss!

283
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:55,416
Bravo!

284
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:00,707
I'll split.

285
00:35:00,792 --> 00:35:02,374
For the three of us.

286
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,166
For Blas.

287
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,874
Here. For Lucas.

288
00:35:07,792 --> 00:35:10,207
We're rich now. Rich!

289
00:35:10,292 --> 00:35:11,791
I caught you!

290
00:35:11,917 --> 00:35:13,291
You too, you too!

291
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:18,291
Have you started ruining the table?

292
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:21,874
Something's missing... half a baguette!

293
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:25,582
Rut, you're eating already?

294
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:27,749
And you, too?

295
00:35:33,458 --> 00:35:35,291
Come here with your grandmother.

296
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,374
Do you like this music, my dear?

297
00:36:29,667 --> 00:36:33,999
It's understandable
that the school expelled him.

298
00:36:34,083 --> 00:36:36,166
Come on, two computers!

299
00:36:36,292 --> 00:36:40,166
For God's sake, all children
go through destructive phases.

300
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,499
Well, I don't know.

301
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:46,666
Within a fortnight, nobody will remember
the computers or the boy.

302
00:36:46,792 --> 00:36:49,207
Because the boy
will be up to something else.

303
00:36:49,292 --> 00:36:51,791
He's been getting into mischief
for centuries.

304
00:36:51,917 --> 00:36:54,791
Didn't he split
his cousin's head open?

305
00:36:54,875 --> 00:36:56,707
- Of course!
- That's right!

306
00:36:56,792 --> 00:36:59,291
He's been doing the same thing
for six years now.

307
00:36:59,375 --> 00:37:01,749
It was about time
the school said enough!

308
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:04,457
Cousins, after hearing
you talk for half an hour...

309
00:37:05,167 --> 00:37:08,707
You reminded me of a passage
from War and Peace

310
00:37:08,792 --> 00:37:11,916
where Tolstoy talks about Pierre,
the former millionaire

311
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,041
who becomes a pariah
when the French invade Moscow.

312
00:37:16,125 --> 00:37:17,666
It goes something like this:

313
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:23,124
"Pierre felt for the first time
that strange yet pleasant feeling

314
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:27,666
as he suddenly understood
that wealth, power, life,

315
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,832
everything that men fight for
and defend so eagerly,

316
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:36,416
are worth no more than the pleasure
one feels when they abandon you."

317
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:39,416
Juan, it looks like the countryside
is getting to you!

318
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,916
New Age architecture
isn't doing you any good.

319
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,999
I don't see anything funny
in going around breaking things.

320
00:37:45,083 --> 00:37:46,582
Honestly, me neither.

321
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:49,874
What a load of bullshit.

322
00:37:49,958 --> 00:37:51,166
These cousins...

323
00:37:51,292 --> 00:37:52,832
Are you still going on

324
00:37:52,917 --> 00:37:57,124
with your, "It's been a long time.
Ah, it's so nice to see you!"?

325
00:37:57,208 --> 00:38:00,041
What an asshole you are! You know what?

326
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:01,957
Take your shit somewhere else!

327
00:38:02,042 --> 00:38:04,624
You've been drunk since you got here.

328
00:38:04,708 --> 00:38:05,999
Go to sleep!

329
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,624
Listen, people! I honestly think
that Dostoyevsky is far better.

330
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:14,541
Tolstoy is... too intense!

331
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:17,874
And the truth is that
the greatest is Chekhov.

332
00:38:17,958 --> 00:38:20,541
Or do you only read modern books?

333
00:38:34,292 --> 00:38:35,874
Suck him off!

334
00:38:49,917 --> 00:38:51,457
Harder up his ass.

335
00:38:59,542 --> 00:39:01,041
Fuck him in the ass!

336
00:39:02,208 --> 00:39:03,374
Push! Push!

337
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,416
Go on, fuck his hole!

338
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:24,707
Do it harder! Harder!

339
00:39:46,042 --> 00:39:48,499
We need two guys... Two men.

340
00:39:51,625 --> 00:39:53,457
We need two!

341
00:39:53,542 --> 00:39:55,374
Come on, come on!

342
00:40:07,542 --> 00:40:10,541
Harder!

343
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:22,624
Shall we go?

344
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:35,874
Excuse me, we're looking
for the Duchamp room.

345
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:37,332
Yes, it's right here.

346
00:40:39,417 --> 00:40:42,166
- Where are you from?
- Mexico.

347
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:45,832
- Is this your first time here?
- Yes, we'll see how it goes.

348
00:40:45,917 --> 00:40:48,249
- You speak good French.
- Well, more or less...

349
00:40:48,375 --> 00:40:50,541
Would you like a cigarette
before you go in?

350
00:40:50,625 --> 00:40:52,332
No, thanks, we don't smoke.

351
00:40:55,667 --> 00:40:57,291
You're right, it's expensive.

352
00:40:57,375 --> 00:40:59,582
- Yes, it is.
- Very expensive, actually.

353
00:40:59,667 --> 00:41:00,957
What, then?

354
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:04,041
The kid's holidays are longer...

355
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:06,374
- Close the door, Natalia.
- Yes, Juan.

356
00:41:10,042 --> 00:41:12,041
We're looking for the Duchamp room.

357
00:41:13,333 --> 00:41:14,749
This room is Hegel.

358
00:41:14,833 --> 00:41:19,124
Duchamp is next door,
through the metal door.

359
00:41:19,833 --> 00:41:23,207
- So, this one is Hegel?
- Yes.

360
00:41:23,292 --> 00:41:26,166
- It's this door, through here.
- The metal one?

361
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,624
You go in first.

362
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:33,832
Goodbye.

363
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:35,624
Come in.

364
00:41:45,917 --> 00:41:48,332
- Hello.
- Hello.

365
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,041
I'm glad we came here, man.

366
00:42:36,458 --> 00:42:37,957
You have beautiful skin.

367
00:42:44,125 --> 00:42:46,416
I also want her. I want her for me.

368
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,666
You're so beautiful.

369
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:55,291
Gently, sir!

370
00:43:02,417 --> 00:43:04,916
- She's good-looking.
- Yes, she is.

371
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:09,541
Not so quickly!

372
00:43:09,625 --> 00:43:11,124
Go on, Valerie.

373
00:43:17,458 --> 00:43:19,374
You're beautiful.

374
00:43:21,458 --> 00:43:23,791
Don't worry, everything will be OK.

375
00:43:25,458 --> 00:43:28,291
- What's your name?
- Natalia.

376
00:43:30,417 --> 00:43:31,957
Everything will be fine.

377
00:43:37,208 --> 00:43:39,249
Would you like to be in her place?

378
00:43:39,833 --> 00:43:41,874
I'd prefer to have her for myself!

379
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,499
Are you OK?

380
00:43:45,583 --> 00:43:46,832
Yes.

381
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:53,249
It's fine. Relax...

382
00:43:58,875 --> 00:44:01,416
Just enjoy it.

383
00:44:02,167 --> 00:44:03,707
OK.

384
00:44:03,792 --> 00:44:06,374
Your body is made for this.

385
00:44:06,458 --> 00:44:08,249
You must let go.

386
00:44:10,417 --> 00:44:12,207
Do you feel better now?

387
00:44:13,042 --> 00:44:14,707
Yes.

388
00:44:14,792 --> 00:44:16,041
Are you sure?

389
00:44:17,167 --> 00:44:18,749
I... I love this.

390
00:44:24,417 --> 00:44:26,249
How does that feel?

391
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:29,832
It's coming.

392
00:45:12,917 --> 00:45:15,541
They all want you
because you're beautiful.

393
00:45:19,375 --> 00:45:20,999
Yes.

394
00:45:25,958 --> 00:45:27,541
Thank you.

395
00:45:29,958 --> 00:45:32,791
This is a pleasure for me, Natalia.

396
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,541
You're late.

397
00:46:33,625 --> 00:46:34,832
Glove.

398
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,666
Seven.

399
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,041
This is the tree.

400
00:46:41,708 --> 00:46:44,166
It's a big one, isn't it?

401
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:45,832
That'll teach 'em.

402
00:46:47,125 --> 00:46:49,124
It'll make a hell of a noise.

403
00:46:49,208 --> 00:46:53,624
Shit! Do the branches first.
That's what I'm paying you for.

404
00:46:53,708 --> 00:46:55,041
You're the boss.

405
00:46:56,375 --> 00:46:57,999
For fuck's sake!

406
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:01,999
Stop it, you bastards!

407
00:47:07,875 --> 00:47:09,916
Fucking dogs!

408
00:47:11,833 --> 00:47:13,374
Let's get to work!

409
00:47:14,792 --> 00:47:17,166
I turn my back for a second
and you steal my place?

410
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:18,832
That's how it is, man.

411
00:47:18,958 --> 00:47:20,791
I want you to use an axe.

412
00:47:20,875 --> 00:47:23,124
Screw the chainsaw and the noise.

413
00:47:23,208 --> 00:47:25,416
I'll have to do it at night
so nobody sees me.

414
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,124
Would you prefer 9am
with a coffee and a sandwich?

415
00:47:31,167 --> 00:47:33,124
For fuck's sake.

416
00:47:39,667 --> 00:47:41,749
What are you going to do here, Glove?

417
00:47:42,542 --> 00:47:45,582
I'm going to sow my corn.
This land is great!

418
00:47:45,667 --> 00:47:48,707
- It'll take really well.
- And what will your sister say?

419
00:47:48,792 --> 00:47:51,332
I don't give a shit!
She says she'll get me first,

420
00:47:51,417 --> 00:47:54,457
but I've already bought the gun
to kill the stupid bitch!

421
00:47:54,542 --> 00:47:57,166
So why do you want
to take the tree down, then?

422
00:47:57,250 --> 00:48:01,332
To annoy her! She thinks trees
talk amongst themselves,

423
00:48:01,417 --> 00:48:05,124
that they're alive, that they
fuck each other! The damned trees!

424
00:48:05,208 --> 00:48:08,249
Just imagine the mess
it would make on my field!

425
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:14,582
Here on the field,
what a fucking mess!

426
00:48:14,667 --> 00:48:16,791
Sure, avocado trees
drop loads of leaves.

427
00:48:22,542 --> 00:48:26,832
I'll shoot her on sight
even if it's in the back.

428
00:48:28,333 --> 00:48:32,291
She's done that, the bitch.
Who knows how many she's killed?

429
00:48:32,375 --> 00:48:34,332
And she always shoots 'em in the back.

430
00:48:37,542 --> 00:48:39,791
I don't want to go just yet.

431
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:42,374
I'm still young
and what would my children say?

432
00:48:42,458 --> 00:48:45,291
That I let myself
be slaughtered like a pig?

433
00:48:46,833 --> 00:48:51,041
I won't let those shits down, even
though they've stopped speaking to me.

434
00:48:51,125 --> 00:48:53,041
Still, they're my kids.

435
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,707
Assholes!

436
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:02,749
Why do you quarrel so much, Glove?

437
00:49:02,833 --> 00:49:05,499
Look, Seven, I don't quarrel.

438
00:49:05,583 --> 00:49:08,374
Who gives a shit
about that bitch's life?

439
00:49:08,458 --> 00:49:09,666
Anyway...

440
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:13,207
I won't even have to go hide in the US.

441
00:49:13,292 --> 00:49:16,374
I'll just chop down the tree
and don't want any trouble.

442
00:49:16,458 --> 00:49:20,249
That's all I asked for.
I'm just telling you my stuff.

443
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:23,957
So if you don't like it,
go fuck yourself! Asshole.

444
00:49:39,833 --> 00:49:41,999
I'll pay you when you're done, Seven.

445
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,082
Fine, Glove.

446
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:47,332
Green! Coloured lights!

447
00:50:48,417 --> 00:50:50,749
Green! White! Red!

448
00:50:51,375 --> 00:50:53,124
And blue!

449
00:50:54,792 --> 00:50:56,624
And pink!

450
00:50:58,292 --> 00:51:01,082
Green again and now red!

451
00:51:06,708 --> 00:51:07,874
Cheers, Seven!

452
00:51:07,958 --> 00:51:10,791
Are you drinking water?
This one's for you.

453
00:51:11,583 --> 00:51:14,624
- Get him a special one.
- It's rum, man!

454
00:51:16,625 --> 00:51:18,374
Seriously, rum?

455
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:19,957
But I have a bad hangover.

456
00:51:20,042 --> 00:51:21,666
This'll help you, then!

457
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,541
You're right, it's rum.

458
00:51:28,833 --> 00:51:30,332
It's good.

459
00:51:33,542 --> 00:51:34,707
One beer?

460
00:51:38,208 --> 00:51:39,499
Mexicans.

461
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:44,249
Mexicans are stupid shits
in your opinion, whitey?

462
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:46,166
- No.
- No.

463
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:47,541
The Mexican...?

464
00:51:47,625 --> 00:51:48,791
I'm Mexican.

465
00:51:48,875 --> 00:51:51,499
- So am I.
- So are we.

466
00:51:51,583 --> 00:51:53,832
Maybe even more than you!

467
00:51:54,417 --> 00:51:56,916
We Mexicans have our traditions.

468
00:51:58,208 --> 00:51:59,541
Sure.

469
00:51:59,625 --> 00:52:01,124
Go on, tell us about them.

470
00:52:01,208 --> 00:52:04,374
- Tell us about them!
- Which one do you want?

471
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:06,082
The 12th of December?

472
00:52:06,167 --> 00:52:11,666
I get wasted to honour...
my Lady of Guadalupe.

473
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:13,291
My name is Natalia.

474
00:52:13,375 --> 00:52:16,624
Pleased to meet you, Nati.

475
00:52:16,708 --> 00:52:18,082
Can I call you "Nati"?

476
00:52:18,167 --> 00:52:21,749
- With all due respect?
- Sure, Nati is OK.

477
00:52:21,833 --> 00:52:23,624
My love, I'm leaving.

478
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:26,832
They're starting to get a little drunk.

479
00:52:26,917 --> 00:52:28,749
Take the kids. I'll be home soon.

480
00:52:28,833 --> 00:52:30,541
If you really live nearby,...

481
00:52:31,958 --> 00:52:36,291
..you're welcome to my poor home
on the 12th of December.

482
00:52:36,375 --> 00:52:38,041
In my poor home which is yours.

483
00:52:38,125 --> 00:52:40,332
- Thank you!
- And we'll have a beer.

484
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:14,916
IIai, son!

485
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:23,207
Is the sea rough, Rut?

486
00:54:26,792 --> 00:54:29,374
Rutilia, why do you get me wet?

487
00:54:29,458 --> 00:54:30,832
Eleazar.

488
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:36,707
How's the water, my girl?

489
00:54:40,542 --> 00:54:42,374
Give me one of those, lvan.

490
00:54:49,917 --> 00:54:51,166
Do you like it, love?

491
00:54:52,667 --> 00:54:54,416
Bitter as hell!

492
00:54:59,125 --> 00:55:00,874
But you said they were flying.

493
00:55:00,958 --> 00:55:03,582
I mean, swimming, not flying.

494
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:04,957
They're flying fish!

495
00:55:05,042 --> 00:55:07,457
Don't you know anything about fish,
Eleazar?

496
00:55:07,542 --> 00:55:08,999
Actually, I don't but...

497
00:55:09,667 --> 00:55:11,332
I suppose... they are...

498
00:57:58,583 --> 00:58:00,249
Have you got two?

499
00:58:00,333 --> 00:58:01,791
That was quick!

500
00:58:01,875 --> 00:58:03,291
Come, sit with us.

501
00:58:03,375 --> 00:58:04,832
Have dinner here.

502
00:58:04,917 --> 00:58:06,916
Tell your sister to sit with us.

503
00:58:08,083 --> 00:58:09,332
Here you come.

504
00:58:10,417 --> 00:58:11,624
Come here!

505
00:58:15,292 --> 00:58:18,624
Where were you?
How about dinner? Put her plate here.

506
00:58:18,708 --> 00:58:20,457
Everyone sits next to Daddy.

507
00:58:22,333 --> 00:58:24,166
Do you want more cheese?

508
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:26,749
Rut? You, too?

509
00:58:26,833 --> 00:58:29,832
Which do you prefer,
the big one or the small one?

510
00:58:29,917 --> 00:58:31,207
The small one!

511
00:58:31,292 --> 00:58:33,374
That's the present they gave us.

512
00:58:33,458 --> 00:58:35,832
- Do you want bread?
- lt's good.

513
00:58:35,917 --> 00:58:37,499
Do you want a grapefruit, love?

514
00:58:39,667 --> 00:58:42,332
Yes, please.
And pass the strawberries.

515
00:58:46,125 --> 00:58:47,874
That cheese is great, eh?

516
00:58:50,042 --> 00:58:54,332
Orange... Orange... Orange...

517
00:58:56,625 --> 00:58:58,499
Orange... Here's one!

518
00:59:01,583 --> 00:59:05,207
Here you go.
I will cut it. In Rut's plate.

519
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:07,666
Chelita, please get Eleazar's bed ready.

520
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:08,957
Yes, ma'am.

521
00:59:09,042 --> 00:59:10,666
And one for you.

522
00:59:12,292 --> 00:59:14,374
What about the quesadillas?

523
00:59:15,625 --> 00:59:18,999
This is for you. Finish your egg.
I'll get your quesadilla.

524
00:59:19,083 --> 00:59:21,332
I don't want my egg.

525
00:59:21,417 --> 00:59:23,124
You need to eat, love.

526
00:59:31,250 --> 00:59:33,541
- A half will do.
- OK, love.

527
00:59:33,625 --> 00:59:35,999
There's Buzz Lightyear.

528
00:59:40,083 --> 00:59:42,124
She's not your love.

529
00:59:42,583 --> 00:59:44,374
I'm gonna screw you tonight.

530
00:59:45,375 --> 00:59:47,499
Which burned tortilla?

531
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:50,457
That's not a burned tortilla.

532
00:59:53,625 --> 00:59:55,082
So?

533
00:59:55,208 --> 00:59:56,666
Sure, but remember...

534
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:58,916
I have that infection.

535
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,874
What's the back door for, then?

536
01:00:02,833 --> 01:00:06,707
- Here are the dishes, ma'am.
- Thank you, Chelita.

537
01:00:06,792 --> 01:00:10,624
Take the girl and change her.
I'll be there in a sec.

538
01:00:10,708 --> 01:00:12,332
Goodnight, my little one.

539
01:00:13,458 --> 01:00:16,166
- Can you take her, Chelita?
- Yes. Let's go, dear.

540
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:17,416
- Hey!
- Goodnight!

541
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:19,332
- Move over for dad!
- Goodnight!

542
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:24,791
- Goodnight!
- Say goodnight to your sister!

543
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:27,874
You didn't say goodnight.

544
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:29,832
- I know where.
- Yeah?

545
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:31,666
- Where?
- Here!

546
01:00:33,125 --> 01:00:34,666
It's beautiful, isn't it?

547
01:00:41,292 --> 01:00:43,374
Let me change your nappy.

548
01:00:43,458 --> 01:00:48,332
I want a story about planets.

549
01:00:48,417 --> 01:00:49,999
- Planets?
- Yeah.

550
01:00:50,708 --> 01:00:52,499
Mercury.

551
01:00:53,833 --> 01:00:56,124
Saturn, Chelita!

552
01:00:56,208 --> 01:00:57,666
Mars, eh?

553
01:00:57,750 --> 01:01:00,624
- Not Mars!
- Come, Rut!

554
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:05,249
There was a long tail.

555
01:01:05,333 --> 01:01:07,832
It was long, long, long...

556
01:01:07,917 --> 01:01:12,999
- So then, people got scared!
- Really?

557
01:01:13,083 --> 01:01:16,666
So they started running but... but...

558
01:01:19,667 --> 01:01:26,374
..somebody dressed up as a T-rex

559
01:01:26,458 --> 01:01:29,457
cos they wanted to scare people.

560
01:01:30,833 --> 01:01:33,582
But they were all...

561
01:01:37,875 --> 01:01:39,541


..running.

562
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:45,499
At that moment, they saw...

563
01:01:48,167 --> 01:01:51,166
- ..Peter Parker arrived!
- Yeah, sure.

564
01:01:59,625 --> 01:02:04,249
I don't think the vet
really believed the story.

565
01:02:04,375 --> 01:02:11,916
I saw him again today and... and...
I think he's very suspicious of me.

566
01:02:13,375 --> 01:02:15,916
I'm going to sit down.
I'm exhausted. But tell me.

567
01:02:22,375 --> 01:02:23,957
Poor dog, love.

568
01:02:25,250 --> 01:02:30,249
I know. And I always hurt...
the one I love most.

569
01:02:30,375 --> 01:02:32,666
Cos she's the most intelligent one,
Juan.

570
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,541
You have to help me stop doing that.

571
01:02:37,667 --> 01:02:39,999
Please help me. I feel awful.

572
01:02:40,875 --> 01:02:42,041
OK, love.

573
01:02:49,625 --> 01:02:53,749
Driving to the city was worth it, love.
I saw some wonderful fabrics.

574
01:02:53,833 --> 01:02:55,874
I still don't know
what you want them for.

575
01:02:55,958 --> 01:02:58,707
I insist that curtains
should always be white.

576
01:02:58,792 --> 01:03:00,999
As simple as possible.

577
01:03:07,208 --> 01:03:09,416
If you overdo them,
they ruin everything.

578
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:12,082
They don't look good
and they ruin the house.

579
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,291
Fine.

580
01:03:18,375 --> 01:03:21,541
What do you mean, "fine"?
What do you think?

581
01:03:21,625 --> 01:03:23,749
You kill my enthusiasm.
Nothing suits you!

582
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:26,541
Nothing suits me?
I was only talking about curtains!

583
01:03:26,667 --> 01:03:28,332
I never said I didn't like them.

584
01:03:38,417 --> 01:03:41,957
- Do you want to eat something, love?
- Not today. I'm too tired.

585
01:03:42,042 --> 01:03:43,666
What is there to eat?

586
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:47,374
There's eggs, fruit, quiche...

587
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:49,416
What do you want?

588
01:03:49,542 --> 01:03:52,582
- Leftovers?
- Don't know.

589
01:03:56,625 --> 01:03:59,999
Go to bed. You're tired.
We can fuck tomorrow.

590
01:04:00,083 --> 01:04:02,249
I'm not tired! I have a headache.

591
01:04:02,333 --> 01:04:04,124
You talk too much.

592
01:04:04,208 --> 01:04:05,332
Oh, fuck.

593
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,374
I'll go feed the dogs.

594
01:04:08,458 --> 01:04:09,832
I'll catch you later.

595
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:17,791
What is it now? Don't start crying!

596
01:04:17,875 --> 01:04:19,374
I'm not crying.

597
01:04:19,875 --> 01:04:22,791
We can't talk.
You twist everything I say!

598
01:04:22,917 --> 01:04:24,499
Calm down. Talk quietly.

599
01:04:24,583 --> 01:04:28,916
Always talking about acceptance
but always telling others what to do.

600
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:31,332
That's not true.

601
01:04:31,417 --> 01:04:33,207
If I say so, there must be a reason.

602
01:04:39,875 --> 01:04:42,999
I don't want to talk.
That's enough! I can't.

603
01:04:43,833 --> 01:04:45,291
Yes, sir! I'll shut up.

604
01:04:50,708 --> 01:04:52,791
I'm sorry. I got carried away.

605
01:04:54,542 --> 01:04:57,082
OK, but why? Why do you act like that?

606
01:04:57,167 --> 01:04:58,457
It's not all my fault.

607
01:04:58,542 --> 01:05:01,249
You cause trouble
by bringing up little details,

608
01:05:01,333 --> 01:05:03,999
and in the end,
I'm always the bad guy.

609
01:05:04,083 --> 01:05:05,874
I know we're both to blame...

610
01:05:05,958 --> 01:05:07,707
You avoid everything sexual.

611
01:05:07,792 --> 01:05:09,916
I have to masturbate every damn night!

612
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,166
You're always sleepy or something hurts!

613
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:14,791
That's not true! Today, I felt fine.

614
01:05:14,875 --> 01:05:17,666
I'm not talking about today,
but in general.

615
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:19,749
Besides, today, you were not fine!

616
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:22,082
At supper, I proposed
we had sex in the ass.

617
01:05:22,167 --> 01:05:25,416
- You avoided the subject.
- Not true! I said yes.

618
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,791
You said yes
after I insisted three times!

619
01:05:35,083 --> 01:05:37,457
Let's discuss it later at the beach.

620
01:05:37,542 --> 01:05:39,999
I can't live like this any longer.

621
01:05:40,083 --> 01:05:42,749
The same old story again?
You want to leave it all.

622
01:05:44,583 --> 01:05:47,374
You always want to leave
at the slightest setback

623
01:05:47,458 --> 01:05:49,374
and won't try to work things through.

624
01:05:49,458 --> 01:05:51,332
Don't you see we have two kids?

625
01:05:51,458 --> 01:05:53,082
Two kids that love us together?

626
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,041
Don't you see that I love you?

627
01:05:57,125 --> 01:05:59,457
Don't you see
that we can be happy together?

628
01:05:59,542 --> 01:06:01,791
But we have to work at it, that's all.

629
01:06:03,167 --> 01:06:04,707
Where's the radio?

630
01:06:08,292 --> 01:06:09,916
Jarro, Jarro!

631
01:06:13,333 --> 01:06:14,624
Jarro!

632
01:06:46,167 --> 01:06:47,416
Güera.

633
01:06:50,167 --> 01:06:52,916
The family guardian.

634
01:09:58,708 --> 01:10:00,707
I didn't do it on purpose.

635
01:10:08,917 --> 01:10:10,832
Don't worry.

636
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:15,457
It's early. We've got time.

637
01:10:15,542 --> 01:10:18,332
I left it on the terrace,
next to the stairs.

638
01:10:26,583 --> 01:10:28,749
Thanks, love. I'm sorry.

639
01:10:30,833 --> 01:10:33,874
Let's hope the kids don't wake up.

640
01:10:36,333 --> 01:10:37,791
Let's hope not.

641
01:10:41,833 --> 01:10:44,041
You can go, then.

642
01:10:46,417 --> 01:10:48,291
I think so.

643
01:10:50,583 --> 01:10:52,166
Do you want some of this?

644
01:10:52,583 --> 01:10:59,207
- It looks spicy.
- It's good! Have a bit. Try it.

645
01:11:00,542 --> 01:11:02,582
Mine is good, too.

646
01:11:02,667 --> 01:11:04,916
It's hot, but it's good.

647
01:11:09,208 --> 01:11:12,124
What's up, Jarro?
You should be at the house!

648
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:13,916
Hello, Juan!

649
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,291
My mother-in-law got diabetes
and almost went blind!

650
01:11:17,375 --> 01:11:19,791
I had to take her to the doctor's.

651
01:11:20,667 --> 01:11:23,916
Wait for me here then, love,
and I'll be right back.

652
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,041
OK, my love.

653
01:11:25,125 --> 01:11:27,374
Jarro, don't leave
the house unattended.

654
01:11:27,458 --> 01:11:31,291
Many people know we're going away
for a few days. OK?

655
01:11:31,375 --> 01:11:33,874
Don't worry, Juan,
I'll take care of everything.

656
01:11:36,958 --> 01:11:39,624
- See you then, love.
- OK.

657
01:11:39,708 --> 01:11:42,582
- Good day, how do you do?
- Look after my family!

658
01:11:42,667 --> 01:11:44,582
Are you the one with diabetes,
madam?

659
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:45,874
- Yes.
- How are you?

660
01:11:45,958 --> 01:11:48,624
- So, so.
- OK, enjoy.

661
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:49,999
Thank you!

662
01:11:50,083 --> 01:11:51,291
What do you want to eat?

663
01:11:52,417 --> 01:11:53,749
What would you like?

664
01:12:14,958 --> 01:12:16,291
I'll be quick, dogs!

665
01:14:10,417 --> 01:14:11,957
Seven!

666
01:14:12,042 --> 01:14:13,791
What the hell are you doing?

667
01:14:17,292 --> 01:14:20,082
Put that down, Seven.
I won't say a word.

668
01:14:20,167 --> 01:14:22,124
This faggot will rat on us.

669
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:24,332
You keep out of this,
you fat bastard!

670
01:14:25,167 --> 01:14:26,957
What's your problem, Seven?

671
01:14:27,083 --> 01:14:29,749
Who do you think you are?
Go fuck your mother!

672
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,041
Give me my gun!

673
01:14:33,125 --> 01:14:34,874
Shut up, asshole.

674
01:14:47,875 --> 01:14:49,582
Drop that. Someone's coming!

675
01:14:57,958 --> 01:14:59,749
Jarro! Jarro!

676
01:15:00,958 --> 01:15:02,624
Is that you?

677
01:15:08,625 --> 01:15:13,082
Don Juan!

678
01:17:27,042 --> 01:17:29,249
Put the cover here to hide it away.

679
01:17:32,083 --> 01:17:34,082
To the right as usual.

680
01:17:34,167 --> 01:17:35,707
Always aim on the outside.

681
01:17:35,792 --> 01:17:38,624
Pass me some cartridges, son.

682
01:17:38,750 --> 01:17:40,582
Look for them.

683
01:17:40,667 --> 01:17:42,624
Pass me two green ones, please.

684
01:17:44,208 --> 01:17:45,249
There you go.

685
01:17:46,583 --> 01:17:48,207
Give your sister a couple.

686
01:17:59,375 --> 01:18:01,332
Pay attention and stay hidden.

687
01:18:02,708 --> 01:18:06,207
Easy does it. Keep an eye...

688
01:18:06,292 --> 01:18:07,666
On the outside.

689
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:09,499
They're coming. Get down!

690
01:18:19,542 --> 01:18:21,041
Shoot now, honey! Shoot!

691
01:18:25,375 --> 01:18:30,041
Many things are changing,
people are retiring.

692
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:36,957
But barter helps,
fresh produce, trips...

693
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:41,916
The obsolescence of money...

694
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,166
I will take it back.

695
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:46,332
How's that?

696
01:18:46,458 --> 01:18:48,499
Do whatever you want.

697
01:18:48,583 --> 01:18:51,416
I'm fixing you a joint
and we'll see how it goes.

698
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:54,916
But it will not make you less stupid.

699
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,041
Do you know what?

700
01:18:58,542 --> 01:19:00,416
I will not play that move.

701
01:19:01,417 --> 01:19:04,957
I haven't let go of the piece.
So just wait.

702
01:19:05,042 --> 01:19:09,416
Don't be stubborn, we can start again.
I offer you a draw.

703
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:11,666
Damn it, I'm burning!

704
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:16,541
I offer you a defeat...
because you're going to lose.

705
01:19:17,917 --> 01:19:20,957
- You're stubborn.
- You always lose.

706
01:19:21,042 --> 01:19:24,624
Have it your way.
We can play another game.

707
01:19:24,708 --> 01:19:27,749
Let's play another one.
Can you do that?

708
01:19:27,833 --> 01:19:30,291
Or are you tired?
If you are, that's too bad.

709
01:19:30,375 --> 01:19:32,332
We can play something else.

710
01:19:32,875 --> 01:19:34,666
Fucking chess!

711
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:39,332
- You think you're gonna win?
- You're as stubborn as a mule!

712
01:19:39,417 --> 01:19:41,291
I showed you on the first game...

713
01:19:41,375 --> 01:19:45,291
You thought you had it,
then I thrashed you.

714
01:19:45,375 --> 01:19:48,832
I let you have it. Checkmate!

715
01:19:48,958 --> 01:19:52,249
OK, OK. You're the best.

716
01:19:53,250 --> 01:19:54,624
Actually, that's not it.

717
01:19:54,708 --> 01:19:58,291
You're not so good, I'm an idiot.
It's not the same thing.

718
01:19:58,375 --> 01:20:01,124
But you're more stupid than me.

719
01:20:01,208 --> 01:20:04,666
You think you're cool
but you didn't win: I lost!

720
01:20:04,750 --> 01:20:06,249
That's the difference.

721
01:20:06,333 --> 01:20:08,291
It's not great. It's sad.

722
01:20:08,375 --> 01:20:09,832
Intense...

723
01:20:09,917 --> 01:20:11,541
That's it, intense.

724
01:20:13,375 --> 01:20:15,041
Some weed?

725
01:20:15,125 --> 01:20:16,541
Get the joint.

726
01:20:19,875 --> 01:20:21,041
Damn it!

727
01:20:21,125 --> 01:20:22,707
You can barter this.

728
01:20:22,792 --> 01:20:24,874
We could trade this joint as well.

729
01:20:26,083 --> 01:20:28,291
But, of course,
you're a good builder.

730
01:20:28,375 --> 01:20:31,874
You could exchange some dope
for your work.

731
01:20:31,958 --> 01:20:34,166
I didn't ruin the wall. That's your job.

732
01:20:34,250 --> 01:20:37,416
That's not my business.

733
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:41,124
- ..then it turns into energy...
- You're destroying things.

734
01:20:41,208 --> 01:20:42,457
How's that?

735
01:20:42,542 --> 01:20:48,124
Even if it's alternative technology,
it must be... well made.

736
01:20:48,208 --> 01:20:52,207
Lean on it, go on.
You need support in life.

737
01:20:53,625 --> 01:20:55,749
Everybody does.

738
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:00,249
Now listen.

739
01:21:01,208 --> 01:21:03,082
You're on the verge of defeat, eh?

740
01:21:05,542 --> 01:21:10,666
At this point, I'll check you,
just to get started.

741
01:21:10,750 --> 01:21:12,457
Nice one!

742
01:21:14,375 --> 01:21:15,874
Then we'll see.

743
01:21:17,958 --> 01:21:21,332
David, how is Juan doing?

744
01:21:21,417 --> 01:21:22,999
No idea, man.

745
01:21:23,083 --> 01:21:27,749
Giacomo! Do you know
how Juan is doing?

746
01:21:27,917 --> 01:21:31,832
I've heard he's getting better.
Losing part of a lung.

747
01:21:31,917 --> 01:21:35,207
It doesn't heal easily, you know.

748
01:21:35,292 --> 01:21:36,874
So he's better, then?

749
01:21:37,583 --> 01:21:40,749
I've heard he's started
to see people.

750
01:21:40,833 --> 01:21:44,041
His closest friends, I imagine.

751
01:21:44,125 --> 01:21:45,874
What are you talking about?

752
01:21:45,958 --> 01:21:49,082
Well, you come to my place
and clean for half a day

753
01:21:49,167 --> 01:21:51,916
and I give you a sausage
in exchange.

754
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,082
That's how the world survives!

755
01:21:54,167 --> 01:21:57,916
But your sausage
is not worth 100 pesos.

756
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:02,416
You're worse than my ex.
You put everything down.

757
01:22:06,625 --> 01:22:10,416
You're the one who wants
to put her down!

758
01:22:17,792 --> 01:22:19,207
Rut!

759
01:22:19,958 --> 01:22:22,916
- What?
- Come down.

760
01:22:24,792 --> 01:22:26,041
Down?

761
01:23:48,250 --> 01:23:50,166
Turn on the light.

762
01:23:50,250 --> 01:23:53,749
Turn on... the... light.

763
01:23:53,833 --> 01:23:55,666
I want to see.

764
01:23:56,333 --> 01:23:58,082
Hello, my love.

765
01:23:58,167 --> 01:24:00,249
How are you feeling?

766
01:24:00,333 --> 01:24:02,082
I'll turn the light on, OK?

767
01:24:03,250 --> 01:24:04,957
Take this off me.

768
01:24:05,792 --> 01:24:07,582
How's your head?

769
01:24:07,667 --> 01:24:09,457
How are you three?

770
01:24:09,542 --> 01:24:11,249
Very well. They had a great time.

771
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:15,332
Your temperature's gone down.
You're getting better.

772
01:24:21,833 --> 01:24:23,124
Look who's here.

773
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:26,666
The big worm of the family.

774
01:24:28,750 --> 01:24:29,791
He's going to fly.

775
01:24:31,417 --> 01:24:34,374
You worm! Come here.

776
01:24:35,417 --> 01:24:37,082
Where did you go?

777
01:24:37,167 --> 01:24:41,124
Be careful with me.
Remember that I'm ill.

778
01:24:41,208 --> 01:24:43,707
Tell me where you went.
Were you climbing?

779
01:24:45,375 --> 01:24:47,291
Did you go up a rock?

780
01:24:47,375 --> 01:24:49,416
It's bigger than my hand.

781
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:52,249
What about you, my princess?
Did you go as well?

782
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:55,374
Princess!

783
01:24:58,250 --> 01:25:01,207
Will you be better soon, Daddy?

784
01:25:01,292 --> 01:25:04,207
- Dad?
- Very soon, my love.

785
01:25:04,333 --> 01:25:06,457
- Can you help me up?
- Yeah.

786
01:25:06,542 --> 01:25:08,832
- You want us to play together again?
- Yeah.

787
01:25:08,917 --> 01:25:10,999
You can climb up alone, honey.

788
01:25:11,583 --> 01:25:14,749
I was in the forest.

789
01:25:14,875 --> 01:25:17,166
- Who with?
- Nobody.

790
01:25:33,917 --> 01:25:35,416
I love you, my girl.

791
01:25:40,167 --> 01:25:41,707
Look at your dad.

792
01:25:49,875 --> 01:25:51,541
Yes.

793
01:25:51,625 --> 01:25:53,957
You're so beautiful, my girl.

794
01:25:59,625 --> 01:26:01,374
You're not well, love.

795
01:26:02,042 --> 01:26:04,124
I'm just tired of being here.

796
01:26:05,417 --> 01:26:07,541
I think I'd better call the doctor.

797
01:26:12,042 --> 01:26:13,874
Play us a song instead.

798
01:26:15,667 --> 01:26:17,457
Today I just want to listen.

799
01:26:18,042 --> 01:26:19,624
Yes.

800
01:26:23,208 --> 01:26:26,124
My children, do you want
Mum to sing us a song?

801
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:28,791
Yeah, one.

802
01:26:32,458 --> 01:26:34,166
What do you want me to play?

803
01:26:37,333 --> 01:26:39,832
- My love?
- Neil Young again.

804
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:42,791
OK.

805
01:27:25,917 --> 01:27:29,416
Where are the chochitos?

806
01:27:30,708 --> 01:27:32,999
I don't have any today.

807
01:27:39,042 --> 01:27:43,082
Can I go watch The Pink Panther, Dad?

808
01:27:44,125 --> 01:27:45,332
Sure.

809
01:27:45,417 --> 01:27:48,291
Can I go watch The Pink Panther?

810
01:27:49,333 --> 01:27:52,166
- You also want The Pink Panther?
- Yes.

811
01:27:52,250 --> 01:27:55,207
- Daddy!
- Careful, darling.

812
01:28:00,083 --> 01:28:03,457
Little worm.

813
01:28:03,542 --> 01:28:05,582
Look after your sister.

814
01:28:05,667 --> 01:28:07,041
Eleazar!

815
01:28:35,250 --> 01:28:38,749
Go ahead, kids.
Ask Chelita to start the internet.

816
01:28:38,833 --> 01:28:41,249
- Yeah.
- I'll be there in a second.

817
01:30:40,917 --> 01:30:42,499
Natalia.

818
01:30:50,542 --> 01:30:53,041
Today I felt as I did
when I was a child.

819
01:31:00,333 --> 01:31:03,082
I felt the grass of Cuernavaca
under my feet.

820
01:31:05,667 --> 01:31:08,207
How it pushed between my toes.

821
01:31:09,667 --> 01:31:11,582
I could feel every blade.

822
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:17,541
It was so cold at dusk.

823
01:31:22,292 --> 01:31:24,207
And the red terrazzo floor,...

824
01:31:27,583 --> 01:31:30,041
..made of sand
and pieces of marble...

825
01:31:35,125 --> 01:31:37,749
I looked at them one by one,
lying on the ground.

826
01:31:40,833 --> 01:31:43,707
Each one had its own shape
and reflections.

827
01:31:46,042 --> 01:31:47,957
I could tell each one apart.

828
01:31:52,208 --> 01:31:55,416
I heard the room
where I slept with my cousins.

829
01:31:57,708 --> 01:31:59,749
It had a special echo.

830
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:09,999
There was a poster of a cow
that said "Catalan Pyrenees".

831
01:32:15,958 --> 01:32:17,707
When we opened the drawers.

832
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:20,374
It smelled of damp sheets and wood.

833
01:32:28,875 --> 01:32:33,082
I would fall asleep,
licking the metal headboard,...

834
01:32:36,833 --> 01:32:39,957
..listening to the song of crickets
I've never heard since.

835
01:32:41,375 --> 01:32:43,582
I don't know if they are extinct now

836
01:32:43,667 --> 01:32:45,791
or if I simply stopped hearing them.

837
01:32:51,583 --> 01:32:54,791
In the distance, I heard my parents
and family laughing.

838
01:32:57,875 --> 01:33:00,041
All I had to do was exist.

839
01:33:03,083 --> 01:33:05,499
Now it's Rut's and Eleazar's turn.

840
01:33:11,792 --> 01:33:14,332
But I didn't feel the usual nostalgia.

841
01:33:16,458 --> 01:33:18,374
Today, I felt love for all things.

842
01:33:20,875 --> 01:33:22,124
A chair.

843
01:33:22,667 --> 01:33:24,416
Glass.

844
01:33:24,542 --> 01:33:26,874
Machines.

845
01:33:26,958 --> 01:33:28,291
Wheels.

846
01:33:30,917 --> 01:33:33,791
Even the loud music
that we hear from the village.

847
01:33:36,167 --> 01:33:38,082
I saw how everything is alive,...

848
01:33:39,708 --> 01:33:41,791
..shining,...

849
01:33:43,458 --> 01:33:45,082
..all of the time.

850
01:33:50,333 --> 01:33:53,082
I felt like a newly bathed baby.

851
01:33:55,083 --> 01:33:56,749
Clean and dry.

852
01:34:19,875 --> 01:34:23,291
I know I've been sick
at the end of my life.

853
01:34:23,958 --> 01:34:26,166
I can see it clearly now.

854
01:34:31,417 --> 01:34:33,666
Go with the kids, love.

855
01:34:33,750 --> 01:34:35,582
But bring me the dogs first.

856
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:43,332
Have you thought about talking
to the police, love?

857
01:34:46,208 --> 01:34:48,332
I still don't remember who it was.

858
01:36:37,792 --> 01:36:39,624
Thanks, man!

859
01:38:07,083 --> 01:38:09,082
- Let's go with Mum.
- Yes.

860
01:38:09,875 --> 01:38:12,666
- You've really grown up, my girl!
- Yes, Daddy!

861
01:38:18,708 --> 01:38:20,207
Duncan.

862
01:38:21,208 --> 01:38:22,249
Duncan!

863
01:38:47,292 --> 01:38:48,832
Samanta.

864
01:38:52,625 --> 01:38:54,832
I'm only here for the children's sake.

865
01:38:57,208 --> 01:38:58,874
How did you find me?

866
01:39:05,167 --> 01:39:07,082
Samanta!

867
01:39:08,417 --> 01:39:11,999
Someone has been trying to find us
on behalf of your boss.

868
01:39:15,625 --> 01:39:16,874
Don Juan?

869
01:39:21,625 --> 01:39:23,332
On behalf of Juan?

870
01:39:25,125 --> 01:39:26,749
I guess so.

871
01:39:35,958 --> 01:39:37,874
Please stay here.

872
01:39:41,833 --> 01:39:43,874
I will sort everything out.

873
01:40:25,833 --> 01:40:28,332
Mission accomplished!

874
01:40:42,125 --> 01:40:46,124
Put some water here.

875
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:48,624
Lend me the hose.

876
01:40:48,708 --> 01:40:50,749
Hello, Eleazar. Hello, Rut.

877
01:40:52,792 --> 01:40:55,082
Sister!

878
01:40:57,333 --> 01:41:00,332
You got me all wet!

879
01:41:02,083 --> 01:41:03,416
Eleazar!

880
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:05,749
What are you doing on your own?

881
01:41:05,833 --> 01:41:08,582
- Hello, Seven.
- Where's your dad?

882
01:41:08,667 --> 01:41:12,749
Come play with us
cos Dad has died already.

883
01:41:14,708 --> 01:41:16,541
Playing...

884
01:41:18,792 --> 01:41:20,374
The Lantern!

885
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:21,957
Playing...

886
01:41:23,833 --> 01:41:26,749
I'm going to play with the bulldozer.

887
01:41:26,833 --> 01:41:31,207
Where is my bulldozer? Where?

888
01:41:31,292 --> 01:41:35,041
The bulldozer. Here! Bring it over!

889
01:41:42,125 --> 01:42:04,374
Samanta!

890
01:42:09,875 --> 01:42:11,707
Merari!

891
01:42:11,792 --> 01:42:13,541
Duncan!
