1
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:38,698
<i>The gates are opening</i>

2
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,239
<i>Amen</i>

3
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:55,045
<i>The gates are opening</i>

4
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:29,719
<i>The gates are opening</i>

5
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,386
Are your parents late?

6
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:03,012
No.

7
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,451
Who's coming?

8
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:08,390
Your papa?

9
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:11,091
He's working.

10
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,426
Your mother?

11
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:17,827
Mama's not feeling well.

12
00:02:19,005 --> 00:02:20,336
An uncle?

13
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,100
An aunt?

14
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,416
Come with me.

15
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,562
Don't worry.
There are less costly ones.

16
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:55,800
There are all kinds
of models for infants.

17
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:14,825
There is lining all around the coffin.

18
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:20,899
Sarah will look beautiful
shrouded in white.

19
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:25,332
All you'll see is her pretty face.

20
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:39,382
Iris, careful.

21
00:03:40,787 --> 00:03:43,449
Sarah's been sleeping all morning.

22
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:45,749
Go wake her, I want to go inside.

23
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,551
Wait for Mama to say so.

24
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,628
- Why is Sarah sleeping?
- Because she's a baby.

25
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,566
- I want to come in!
- Not now.

26
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,329
Let me in or I'll tell my father!

27
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:12,746
Hello, Mama.

28
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:17,552
Mr. Chauke says he'll come
for Sarah at 1:00...

29
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:21,825
...and that you shouldn't worry,
it will be a beautiful funeral.

30
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,860
Tell him not to come.

31
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,925
We can't afford it.

32
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,590
- But...
- The money's gone.

33
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,895
- What?
- Someone stole it.

34
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:01,898
I heard about Sarah.

35
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:03,863
So sad.

36
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:07,272
Jonah! It's Chanda.

37
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:13,403
He beat himself with a rock,
to chase out the demons.

38
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:14,876
Not hard enough!

39
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,415
You're funny!

40
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:24,652
Mr. Chauke is coming for Sarah
at 1:00.

41
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,521
One o'clock!

42
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,364
What are you doing?

43
00:05:37,904 --> 00:05:39,701
It's to bury Sarah.

44
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,940
Hey! Give that back!

45
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,738
Give that money back!

46
00:06:15,007 --> 00:06:19,205
Look who decided to come to school!

47
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,516
Chanda!

48
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:30,451
Where were you this morning?

49
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,619
It's my little sister.

50
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:43,130
She passed away.

51
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:47,602
I'm sorry.

52
00:06:48,307 --> 00:06:50,138
Stay home a few days.

53
00:06:52,945 --> 00:06:55,209
Becca! Calm down!

54
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,116
Esther!

55
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:11,361
Don't look at me like that!

56
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:14,455
You skip classes, so do I.

57
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,328
What is it?

58
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:30,641
Sarah?

59
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,813
I'm sorry.

60
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,890
Really sorry.

61
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:45,528
Hello, Mrs. Tafa.

62
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,859
Can I phone Mama's family?

63
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:55,531
I came by this morning,
but nobody answered.

64
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:57,940
I'm sorry.

65
00:07:58,377 --> 00:07:59,401
It's Sarah.

66
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,210
I heard.

67
00:08:06,285 --> 00:08:09,686
Hey, you!
Go play somewhere else!

68
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,289
Now!

69
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:18,423
Mama doesn't want them to know.

70
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,694
Your mother is a wise woman.

71
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,359
Can I call the family from your house?

72
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:30,433
It's your mama
who should do the calling.

73
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:39,979
The funeral is Thursday.

74
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:42,515
Yes.

75
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,152
Please let them know, Mr. Kamwendo.

76
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,322
Goodbye.

77
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:57,597
Sarah's death is so sad.

78
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:00,770
Just like my Emmanuel's.

79
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,601
At least they died pure.

80
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:10,480
Everyone knows
Sarah died of influenza...

81
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:15,015
...and that my Emmanuel was killed
during that awful robbery.

82
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:19,214
No one can spread rumors
or point fingers.

83
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:22,120
You understand what I'm saying?

84
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,923
Do you?

85
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:27,898
Do you or don't you?

86
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:31,386
Mama. Will Grandma recognize me?

87
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:34,597
Sure, when she sees those cheeks!

88
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:37,792
- What about my cheeks?
- Let's see.

89
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:39,595
That's for sure.

90
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,009
The bus from Tiro is here!

91
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:22,714
I'm the only one who could come.

92
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,745
I'm sick of being bounced about
all day.

93
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:31,581
I've had enough.

94
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:32,849
Hello.

95
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:38,262
Are these two from the new husband?

96
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:40,622
Jonah.

97
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:46,431
Hey, are you going to help me,
or just stand there looking lazy?

98
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:53,376
Chanda is always helping.
She's very good in school.

99
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:57,212
My back is killing me!

100
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,214
"My back is killing me!"

101
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:03,615
Cheeky! You're your mother's son!

102
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:14,021
Sarah is hiding. We have to find her.

103
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,666
How do we find her?

104
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,734
You have to know where to look.

105
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,401
I know all her hiding places.

106
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,711
I want to search too.

107
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,569
You're too little.

108
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:31,943
I have special eyes.
Nothing can hide from me.

109
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:36,080
You can scrub
but that dirt won't come out.

110
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:37,846
We'll see.

111
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:40,253
Lillian is always cleaning.

112
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:43,485
Ever since the day I put her up
with her late husband...

113
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:45,357
...it's always spotless.

114
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:48,231
- You put them up?
- Yes.

115
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,425
Mrs. Tafa is a real friend.

116
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:56,265
Remember when you rented
this place, how we fixed it up?

117
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:59,171
"God loves a cheerful giver."

118
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:05,042
Those bracelets.
How does she manage to wear them?

119
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:07,646
And her skirt!

120
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:12,519
It's so short,
if she bends over, all the neighbors...

121
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:14,454
...will see her panties!

122
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:19,096
Don't you worry,
I'm not wearing any panties.

123
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:20,926
What did she say?

124
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:26,135
This girl's always been a wild one!

125
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,806
And you tell me
she's Chanda's friend?

126
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:31,701
She helps us, at least.

127
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:38,808
Let me just tell you,
watch out for this Esther.

128
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,213
You feel sorry for her...

129
00:13:41,387 --> 00:13:44,220
...since her parents died,
but if she isn't careful...

130
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:47,256
...she'll meet a bad end like them.

131
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:51,890
I hope she burned their sheets!

132
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:17,983
Jonah.

133
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:22,492
Lillian!

134
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:25,388
Open up!

135
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,068
Open up, woman!

136
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,537
Let me in, you devil!

137
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,490
Leave him.

138
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:57,385
Open up.

139
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:05,793
Auntie Ruth is here.

140
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:08,906
Go watch the children.

141
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,281
You poisoned Sarah.

142
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,818
You're drunk!

143
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:29,092
You poisoned her with your milk.

144
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:30,728
Shut up!

145
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:32,292
You make me feel ashamed.

146
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:36,296
I'm sorry, Lillian.

147
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,801
Our little Sarah.

148
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:41,132
Papa!

149
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:43,868
My darlings.

150
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:49,276
- Papa loves you so much.
- Papa's not feeling well.

151
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:52,712
- He needs rest.
- Come play, Papa.

152
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:56,553
Go for a walk.

153
00:15:58,724 --> 00:15:59,952
No!

154
00:16:00,726 --> 00:16:04,958
Come home with me,
I have lots of candy.

155
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:10,866
Leave me alone!

156
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:14,869
Papa said you made Sarah sick.

157
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,476
- When?
- Just now, when he was yelling.

158
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,776
Sarah's on a trip. That's all.

159
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:23,574
Will you give us away too?

160
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,378
How could you think that?

161
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:29,312
You want us to go to Auntie Ruth's.

162
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:34,249
- Are you going to get rid of us?
- Not in your life.

163
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,750
So why can't we stay?

164
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,498
Papa is resting.

165
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:48,403
I promised Auntie Ruth
that you'd stay with her.

166
00:16:50,876 --> 00:16:53,276
Just a few days.
Then you can come home.

167
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:55,777
Okay?

168
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:59,908
Come to your Auntie Ruth's.
I have plenty of nice things.

169
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:05,580
Ice cream, sweets,
everything you want.

170
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:47,289
"They who believe in me...

171
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,258
...believe in God...

172
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:55,065
...and will live for eternity."

173
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:39,343
I'll always be your friend, you know.

174
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,379
Even if people say bad things
about your family.

175
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:46,882
I'll always be your friend.

176
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:48,416
What would they say?

177
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,053
I don't know.

178
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:53,183
But if that should happen...

179
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:58,423
...and they say things
about your family...

180
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,294
...I'll still be your friend.

181
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,931
Don't talk nonsense.
It's bad luck.

182
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:07,537
You'll stay my friend or what?

183
00:20:13,145 --> 00:20:15,978
Yes. I'll stay your friend.

184
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:18,382
Your best friend.

185
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:25,613
I knew you'd say that.

186
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:28,456
We're friends for life.

187
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:31,820
You won't let me down.

188
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,827
I know that.

189
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:05,359
Sorry about your little sister.

190
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:07,498
Thank you, Sipho.

191
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:18,002
Lillian...

192
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:21,844
...you can sew for our church.

193
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,214
We will support you...

194
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,118
...and help you get through this.

195
00:21:31,823 --> 00:21:33,017
Thank you, Rose.

196
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:17,964
Lillian...

197
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:21,736
...I'm going to find work...

198
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,908
...and look after you.

199
00:22:26,712 --> 00:22:28,236
Please, forgive me.

200
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,451
Forgive me, Lillian.

201
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:05,239
We're glad you came.

202
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,247
I know my duty.

203
00:23:09,955 --> 00:23:13,550
Don't bother waiting with me.

204
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,666
Your Sarah paid a terrible price.

205
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:28,732
What?

206
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:33,571
As you sow, so shall you reap, sister.
The sins are visited on the children.

207
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,637
Repent.

208
00:24:02,507 --> 00:24:04,099
What is it?

209
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:07,474
What did she mean?

210
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:21,083
Tell me.

211
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,021
Why do they hate you?

212
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:31,298
They'll never forgive me.

213
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:37,931
They'd arranged for me
to marry someone from Tiro.

214
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:43,309
But your papa and I...

215
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:45,982
...loved each other so much...

216
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:48,379
...that we stood up...

217
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:52,554
...to our families.

218
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:06,603
Your father was a good man.

219
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:11,899
May he rest in peace.

220
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,400
Jonah?

221
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,141
Look who's here!

222
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:37,577
What have you brought me?

223
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,454
Superb!

224
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,725
Your mother does the best work.

225
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:48,930
How is she?

226
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:54,238
She's been resting at the house...

227
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,931
...since Sarah went away.

228
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,300
She works hard.

229
00:28:03,081 --> 00:28:06,676
Good work should be rewarded.

230
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,921
See you on Sunday.

231
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:32,370
Where's Jonah?

232
00:28:33,111 --> 00:28:34,601
That idiot?

233
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:36,713
I haven't seen him in months.

234
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:38,711
Why are you wearing his jacket?

235
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:40,611
Jonah owes me money.

236
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:43,010
He gave it to me.

237
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:45,652
I haven't seen him in ages.

238
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:48,121
That's the truth, girl.

239
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,291
I don't believe you!

240
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:21,951
You shouldn't have washed
Soly's sheets.

241
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:27,528
You didn't see his face,
so ashamed.

242
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,668
It was nothing.

243
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,799
From Mr. Pheto.

244
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,505
He asked how you were.

245
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:41,344
- More gossip.
- No.

246
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:42,639
He meant well.

247
00:29:46,384 --> 00:29:48,579
It hurts all over.

248
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:54,091
It hurts all the time.

249
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:58,725
Except when I look at you.

250
00:30:04,202 --> 00:30:06,193
I ran into Dudu.

251
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:09,032
That good-for-nothing!

252
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,636
She says Jonah is in Jo'burg.

253
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:22,583
Away for three months
without a word!

254
00:30:22,787 --> 00:30:25,278
- What are you doing?
- He can go to hell.

255
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:28,755
- What if he comes back?
- He's a liar!

256
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,552
Nothing but promises!

257
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:37,265
What are you doing
with Papa's things?

258
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:41,332
- He asked for them.
- What for?

259
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:45,470
He's going to Jo'burg.

260
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:49,337
- When will he come back?
- I don't know.

261
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:52,749
I want Papa to come home. Now!

262
00:30:58,423 --> 00:30:59,754
Iris!

263
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,346
- What are you doing?
- I'm playing with Sarah.

264
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:27,040
- What?
- Sarah lives here.

265
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:29,116
That's impossible.

266
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:31,185
Why?

267
00:31:33,491 --> 00:31:39,191
Because she's an angel.
She doesn't want you playing here.

268
00:31:39,364 --> 00:31:40,831
How would you know?

269
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:45,128
You and Mama don't love her
anymore, not like me and Papa.

270
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:46,999
Jonah?

271
00:31:47,171 --> 00:31:50,663
He'd be with us
if he loved us so much.

272
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:53,504
He loves Soly and me, not you.

273
00:31:53,711 --> 00:31:57,374
You're jealous because
he's not your father.

274
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:01,682
You'll be sorry when he comes home.

275
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,392
You should stay with us.

276
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,365
Esther is waiting for me.

277
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:58,742
You should see less of her.

278
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:01,173
I don't understand.

279
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:08,483
- I like Esther, she's nice...
- I don't care what people say.

280
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:13,687
Chanda, I don't think
she's a suitable friend.

281
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:19,886
You understand?
I say this because I worry about you.

282
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:22,760
Worry?
Is this you talking, or her?

283
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:27,365
How dare you!
I saw her sell herself to truckers.

284
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:30,132
- That's a lie!
- It's God's truth!

285
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:34,576
- Chanda.
- Let her go, Lillian.

286
00:33:53,931 --> 00:33:57,492
- Why don't you go in?
- They took my key.

287
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:04,739
You want to see my new room?

288
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:09,472
- You sleep here?
- They think I'm dirty.

289
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:11,513
They're crazy!

290
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:22,117
A good thing my sister and brothers
are at our uncle's.

291
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:25,319
Otherwise they'd live like me.

292
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:32,667
Sorry your mother is sick.

293
00:34:33,504 --> 00:34:35,062
Who says that?

294
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:41,300
Nobody. You miss school a lot.

295
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:44,037
Looking after a family is hard.

296
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:47,250
And I saw her with a cane.

297
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:53,253
Not a cane, a walking stick,
to avoid stumbling at the cemetery.

298
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,059
You're my best friend.

299
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,495
- I do love you.
- What do you mean?

300
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:02,462
- She's very thin.
- She's fine!

301
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:06,167
You may be clever,
but you can be so stupid.

302
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:09,864
- Talk like that is stupid!
- My parents said so too.

303
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:14,000
- So what?
- You think she's different?

304
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:16,772
- Will your aunt care for you?
- Shut up, Esther!

305
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,212
- It's just that...
- That's enough!

306
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:35,825
Forgive me. I'm sorry.

307
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,025
Esther, it's not...

308
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:43,007
Forgive me. I'm sorry, Esther.

309
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,779
Mama.

310
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,018
You still think about Papa?

311
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:43,734
It was hard, darling.

312
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:46,300
The family abandoned us.

313
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,429
You were already on the way.

314
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:52,841
I know you don't like Mrs. Tafa...

315
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,445
...but she was there
for your father and me.

316
00:36:57,114 --> 00:36:59,173
She helped us a lot.

317
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:05,155
It's not her.
It's you who worked so hard.

318
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:13,956
I was naive, my darling.

319
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:16,994
I was in love.

320
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:20,599
A village girl.

321
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:23,865
I didn't know what would happen...

322
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:30,007
...if I disobeyed.

323
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:32,646
I was courageous...

324
00:37:35,052 --> 00:37:37,145
...but I was too ignorant...

325
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:42,349
...to manage...

326
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,222
...to do what I wanted to do.

327
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,489
But you, my darling...

328
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:51,659
...you're smarter...

329
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:54,928
...than I was.

330
00:37:56,173 --> 00:37:58,437
You amaze me.

331
00:38:43,888 --> 00:38:45,321
She's resting.

332
00:38:45,923 --> 00:38:49,154
- I have to speak to your mother.
- She has a headache.

333
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:56,998
When my Emmanuel was killed,
I slept all the time.

334
00:38:57,201 --> 00:39:00,398
But life goes on.
The headache will go away.

335
00:39:00,604 --> 00:39:02,231
Hello!

336
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:06,272
- We are fine!
- Fine.

337
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:08,776
Tell her I have a plan.

338
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,084
I won't budge until then!

339
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,822
Tell her I have a plan.

340
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:35,062
You're going to love Dr. Chilume.

341
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:37,673
He's a genius.

342
00:39:39,276 --> 00:39:41,210
He has six degrees.

343
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:43,880
They're hanging on the walls...

344
00:39:44,081 --> 00:39:47,778
...framed with gold seals
and red ribbons.

345
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:50,512
He can cure anything.

346
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:55,352
Cancer, colitis, TB.
He knows everything.

347
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:59,553
This other thing too.
He has a secret potion.

348
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:05,896
I wonder if his potion
can also cure farting.

349
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,128
Do you remember?

350
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:15,808
My father built that.

351
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:40,963
If he's so rich,
it's because he's the best.

352
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:43,470
So smarten up.

353
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:51,076
Breathe. Again.

354
00:40:54,819 --> 00:40:56,377
Again.

355
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:05,355
You're suffering from insomnia...

356
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:08,891
...depression and rheumatism.

357
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:10,658
Can you help me?

358
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,126
Yes. I have all sorts of remedies.

359
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:19,566
Before long,
you'll be feeling better.

360
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:23,839
And you'll quickly be back
to your normal life.

361
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:27,183
Doctor, how much will it cost?

362
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:33,186
Six hundred rands.

363
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:38,551
- I can't afford that.
- You can't afford not to.

364
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:44,490
Dr. Chilume,
are these your degrees?

365
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:46,863
Yes, indeed.

366
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:50,231
All your medicine
comes from Herbatex?

367
00:41:52,243 --> 00:41:55,235
You seem like a well-educated girl.

368
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:58,904
That's true.
She reads my mail to me.

369
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:00,277
She's clever.

370
00:42:00,451 --> 00:42:02,476
Scholarship material.

371
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:04,553
Should I read them to you?

372
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:11,118
I think I can offer an alternative
remedy for your mother.

373
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:14,957
Doctor, will it be just as good?

374
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,624
And cheaper?

375
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,128
Chanda! How rude!

376
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,432
No, it's okay.

377
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:27,509
That I can guarantee.

378
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:37,718
Your daughter's loyalty and
intelligence really touch me.

379
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:42,257
I've decided to give you
a month's free treatment.

380
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:48,420
You've got nerve interrupting
the doctor like that.

381
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:50,732
Is that how you raised her?

382
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,966
Mrs. Tafa, she did well for us.

383
00:43:35,212 --> 00:43:38,375
Lillian, the garments are so beautiful.

384
00:43:39,316 --> 00:43:41,978
It's good to see you at church again.

385
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:45,421
- Lillian!
- You're looking good.

386
00:44:42,279 --> 00:44:46,682
- I need money.
- Go back to school.

387
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,681
It's only 100 rands an hour.

388
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:51,446
No, go away. Get lost.

389
00:44:57,961 --> 00:44:59,895
What are you looking at?

390
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:04,290
Go back to your hallelujahs.
Get lost.

391
00:45:06,737 --> 00:45:08,500
What are you doing?

392
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:10,936
They all think I'm doing it anyway.

393
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:13,109
This way, I make money.

394
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:16,411
- You don't need to.
- What are you doing here?

395
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:19,242
Go away! We don't want kids here!

396
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:21,916
Go away!

397
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,712
She's right. Go home.

398
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:30,587
- I want to help you.
- You turned your back on me.

399
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:35,560
Come here, baby. Over here.

400
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:43,998
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, sure.

401
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:48,405
Don't bother. Go home, I need to work.

402
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,142
Don't play with your food.

403
00:46:27,518 --> 00:46:28,712
Sorry.

404
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,318
Finish eating.

405
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:42,229
Take me to the bedroom.

406
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:52,706
You're feverish.
You must go to the hospital.

407
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:57,540
- So the neighbors can gossip?
- No, because you need help.

408
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:04,080
I just need to rest...

409
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:06,347
...then I'll be fine.

410
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,052
It's nothing.

411
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:16,198
It's just a bruise.

412
00:47:23,273 --> 00:47:24,831
Don't say that, Mama.

413
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:32,272
You should see a doctor.

414
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,350
A real doctor.

415
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:42,517
To examine you.

416
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,798
To be tested.

417
00:47:54,738 --> 00:47:56,365
What, Chanda?

418
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,369
What are you saying?

419
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:02,442
Nothing.

420
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,038
I didn't say anything.

421
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:11,743
It's just that... Let me take you.

422
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:14,682
Please, Mama.

423
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,824
You worry too much.

424
00:48:24,601 --> 00:48:25,795
That's enough.

425
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:29,502
I just need to rest.

426
00:49:21,825 --> 00:49:24,055
- Is your mother here?
- She's lying down.

427
00:49:24,494 --> 00:49:27,224
- I must talk to her.
- She's sleeping.

428
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:29,194
I've brought Jonah back.

429
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:31,800
- What?
- He was staying with us.

430
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:36,795
- He was with you?
- Yes, he seems to be going mad.

431
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:38,501
He's a drunk!

432
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:42,071
We don't have all day here!

433
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:45,871
- Go inside!
- Call your mama.

434
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:48,074
- Get out!
- I don't want to.

435
00:49:50,187 --> 00:49:51,415
Get out, I tell you!

436
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:58,986
Kill me, but don't leave me here.
I'd rather die.

437
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:02,425
Get out!

438
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:07,897
Sorry, Chanda.
We can't keep him anymore.

439
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:15,678
Her milk killed my daughter.

440
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:21,078
My blood is good, my seed too.

441
00:50:22,886 --> 00:50:24,444
You put a curse on me.

442
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:38,063
We have children.
Forgive me, brother.

443
00:50:49,646 --> 00:50:51,045
Listen to me.

444
00:50:52,816 --> 00:50:54,283
We'll find you a doctor.

445
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:56,112
A doctor?

446
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:58,284
I don't want your doctor.

447
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:01,323
You did this to me.

448
00:51:15,921 --> 00:51:17,252
Dudu?

449
00:51:18,824 --> 00:51:20,382
Is that you?

450
00:51:21,827 --> 00:51:23,522
Help me.

451
00:51:24,363 --> 00:51:28,129
I don't know you.
You're a dead man, a skeleton.

452
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:31,428
- I don't know you!
- But you and me...

453
00:51:31,603 --> 00:51:33,935
Shut up! Don't talk to me!

454
00:51:36,308 --> 00:51:38,674
Leave me alone! Shut up!

455
00:51:48,053 --> 00:51:49,281
Go back to your homes.

456
00:51:55,561 --> 00:51:59,998
Jonah, I'm sorry. Forgive me.

457
00:52:02,734 --> 00:52:06,363
You can stay here
or come into the house.

458
00:52:07,473 --> 00:52:12,843
Either way, we'll bring you
some water or clothing.

459
00:52:23,822 --> 00:52:28,521
I'm going to the hospital to get help.

460
00:52:30,562 --> 00:52:31,654
There is no help.

461
00:52:55,954 --> 00:52:58,946
Number 325, 325?

462
00:53:00,259 --> 00:53:02,921
- I need an ambulance!
- Get in line!

463
00:53:03,128 --> 00:53:04,527
It's an emergency!

464
00:53:04,730 --> 00:53:06,391
Everybody has an emergency!

465
00:53:06,598 --> 00:53:07,690
Wait your turn!

466
00:53:16,542 --> 00:53:18,476
There's a man who was beaten up.

467
00:53:19,745 --> 00:53:22,407
He's under a cart.

468
00:53:23,549 --> 00:53:25,414
You have to bring him here.

469
00:53:30,989 --> 00:53:33,617
The doctors don't make house calls.

470
00:53:34,159 --> 00:53:36,423
If he is hurt, call the police.

471
00:53:37,296 --> 00:53:39,890
- Maybe they will bring him.
- They won't.

472
00:53:42,267 --> 00:53:46,363
They won't touch him.
They won't even get close to him.

473
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:49,840
Nobody will.

474
00:53:52,844 --> 00:53:54,709
He's very thin.

475
00:53:57,282 --> 00:53:58,749
I think...

476
00:54:01,687 --> 00:54:03,780
I think he's got...

477
00:54:23,141 --> 00:54:24,369
Where is Jonah?

478
00:54:25,811 --> 00:54:27,210
He's gone.

479
00:54:27,713 --> 00:54:28,805
Is he dead?

480
00:54:30,649 --> 00:54:32,276
Did somebody
do something to him?

481
00:54:34,186 --> 00:54:38,179
He left on his own.
He wanted to go.

482
00:54:40,125 --> 00:54:41,615
Mrs. Tafa told me.

483
00:55:06,118 --> 00:55:10,578
An evil wind blows from the north,
from a village.

484
00:55:10,822 --> 00:55:13,086
- Do we agree?
- Yes, we agree.

485
00:55:13,258 --> 00:55:14,520
I see...

486
00:55:15,961 --> 00:55:20,557
I see a raven.
It's hopping on one foot.

487
00:55:20,732 --> 00:55:24,327
Lillian's sister has a club foot.
She came to Sarah's funeral.

488
00:55:24,536 --> 00:55:26,163
- Do we agree?
- Yes, we agree.

489
00:55:27,572 --> 00:55:29,039
Death.

490
00:55:29,541 --> 00:55:31,236
Death.

491
00:55:32,277 --> 00:55:34,745
It took something from your home.

492
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:37,241
I see a demon in you.

493
00:55:37,449 --> 00:55:39,280
I see a demon.

494
00:55:41,853 --> 00:55:44,413
A demon in your body.

495
00:55:57,269 --> 00:55:59,032
Go back to your village.

496
00:56:00,305 --> 00:56:02,899
Cleanse yourself.
Someone took a part of you.

497
00:56:03,742 --> 00:56:06,233
Go home if you want to be cured.

498
00:56:06,578 --> 00:56:08,978
- Do we agree?
- Yes, we agree.

499
00:56:13,218 --> 00:56:15,152
Thank you, Mrs. Gulubane.

500
00:56:15,387 --> 00:56:18,413
Amazing. A miracle.

501
00:56:19,891 --> 00:56:21,791
A miracle!

502
00:56:29,668 --> 00:56:32,831
I must return to Tiro.
This house is bewitched.

503
00:56:33,705 --> 00:56:36,265
- You can't believe that.
- I can't?

504
00:56:36,508 --> 00:56:38,203
Then why did my baby die?

505
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:40,970
Why is my body so sore?
Why does my head ache?

506
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:43,047
Mama, stay.

507
00:56:44,116 --> 00:56:46,641
Mrs. Tafa will help you
with Soly and Iris.

508
00:56:46,818 --> 00:56:49,651
- Don't go.
- I left money for the rent.

509
00:56:51,723 --> 00:56:54,283
- And for food.
- Stay, Mama.

510
00:57:00,065 --> 00:57:04,468
I have to go.
I'm doing it for you, Soly and Iris.

511
00:57:07,139 --> 00:57:08,663
You know I'm right.

512
00:57:10,742 --> 00:57:12,232
I must go.

513
00:57:41,072 --> 00:57:43,563
How long does it take
to break a spell?

514
00:57:44,976 --> 00:57:49,242
As long as it takes
to recover what was taken from me.

515
00:57:50,015 --> 00:57:52,449
Mrs. Gulubane said it would be quick.

516
00:57:52,851 --> 00:57:55,183
Mrs. Gulubane knows everything.

517
00:57:57,122 --> 00:58:00,922
That's right.
She helped solve our problem.

518
00:58:02,928 --> 00:58:05,761
If the neighbors ask, what do you say?

519
00:58:07,299 --> 00:58:09,733
That everything's fine.

520
00:58:40,332 --> 00:58:41,629
I love you.

521
00:58:48,807 --> 00:58:50,502
Come back soon.

522
01:00:51,563 --> 01:00:54,123
Soly and Iris are here,
they're eating mealie pap.

523
01:00:54,332 --> 01:00:55,731
Mama called.

524
01:00:58,036 --> 01:00:59,503
She called?

525
01:01:00,505 --> 01:01:04,737
- Did you speak to her?
- No, I called her.

526
01:01:06,077 --> 01:01:08,341
Mama says everything's fine.

527
01:01:09,981 --> 01:01:11,608
Do you want some pap?

528
01:01:12,717 --> 01:01:14,548
Did she say when she'd call back?

529
01:01:15,787 --> 01:01:19,746
No, but don't worry,
I'll give her your message.

530
01:01:22,894 --> 01:01:25,192
Thanks, but I need to speak to her.

531
01:01:26,531 --> 01:01:32,527
I don't know when she'll call back,
but if you're home I'll call you.

532
01:01:34,072 --> 01:01:35,596
Don't look so sad.

533
01:01:37,175 --> 01:01:39,973
The Lesoles are having a party. Go.

534
01:01:46,618 --> 01:01:49,712
Don't worry, I'll take care of them.

535
01:01:52,590 --> 01:01:55,423
You don't want people to think
you have problems.

536
01:01:57,262 --> 01:01:58,854
Your mother wouldn't want that.

537
01:02:01,699 --> 01:02:03,132
She wouldn't.

538
01:02:05,303 --> 01:02:06,998
Would she?

539
01:02:13,945 --> 01:02:15,970
I'm glad you came.

540
01:02:18,049 --> 01:02:21,951
- Is your mother still up north?
- Yes.

541
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,584
They want her to stay a while.

542
01:02:25,390 --> 01:02:28,985
- That's good news.
- Your mother's lucky.

543
01:02:29,227 --> 01:02:31,127
Enjoy yourself.

544
01:03:42,634 --> 01:03:44,568
I like your smile.

545
01:03:45,904 --> 01:03:49,533
- Really?
- Can I come study at your place?

546
01:03:56,548 --> 01:03:58,982
If you come, we won't study.

547
01:03:59,184 --> 01:04:03,143
Then maybe after exams?

548
01:04:21,139 --> 01:04:23,232
Chanda. Chanda!

549
01:04:25,243 --> 01:04:26,733
Chanda.

550
01:04:30,248 --> 01:04:31,738
Who's there?

551
01:04:32,951 --> 01:04:34,248
Esther.

552
01:04:38,022 --> 01:04:40,149
Don't look at me.

553
01:04:42,694 --> 01:04:44,855
- Come in.
- I can't.

554
01:04:45,363 --> 01:04:47,593
- Your mother?
- Don't worry.

555
01:04:48,132 --> 01:04:49,463
Mama's not here.

556
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:57,799
We have to get you to a hospital.

557
01:04:58,643 --> 01:05:01,908
I've been.
The doctors were busy.

558
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:04,548
A nurse sewed me up.

559
01:05:09,587 --> 01:05:11,316
They should've kept you.

560
01:05:11,956 --> 01:05:15,357
They had no free beds.
To them I'm just a whore.

561
01:05:21,566 --> 01:05:23,898
That's not true.

562
01:05:24,702 --> 01:05:28,263
You're my friend. My best friend.

563
01:05:37,248 --> 01:05:39,716
It was a BMW.

564
01:05:42,487 --> 01:05:44,250
When I got in...

565
01:05:46,791 --> 01:05:48,986
...they beat me.

566
01:05:50,328 --> 01:05:52,057
Then one of them said...

567
01:05:53,998 --> 01:05:58,435
...he had AIDS,
that he'd give it to me.

568
01:06:01,906 --> 01:06:03,464
After that...

569
01:06:05,543 --> 01:06:07,340
...I don't remember.

570
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:11,546
I woke up in a ditch.

571
01:06:22,327 --> 01:06:24,295
How long were you there?

572
01:06:24,495 --> 01:06:27,623
- Who found you?
- The police.

573
01:06:29,567 --> 01:06:33,401
All they said was...

574
01:06:36,574 --> 01:06:40,874
...that I was a whore,
that it served me right.

575
01:06:51,656 --> 01:06:53,681
My little darlings!

576
01:06:54,158 --> 01:06:56,718
You know what? Esther is here.

577
01:06:58,830 --> 01:07:01,958
- Esther Macholo?
- Yes. She fell off her bike.

578
01:07:02,834 --> 01:07:05,268
She's staying in Mama's room.

579
01:07:09,073 --> 01:07:12,565
- Is this a joke?
- Esther has problems.

580
01:07:13,378 --> 01:07:14,845
I bet she does.

581
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:21,482
I'd like to use your phone
to call the shop in Tiro to tell Mama.

582
01:07:22,887 --> 01:07:25,378
- Don't upset her.
- I won't!

583
01:07:41,906 --> 01:07:43,601
Hey, watch it!

584
01:07:57,388 --> 01:08:01,722
We sent someone to your home.
They didn't find anyone.

585
01:08:04,829 --> 01:08:06,490
He's gone.

586
01:08:09,734 --> 01:08:13,170
I'm sorry. Really sorry.

587
01:08:15,339 --> 01:08:17,273
Don't apologize, child.

588
01:08:18,776 --> 01:08:21,836
You look troubled. What is it?

589
01:08:27,251 --> 01:08:28,684
I have a friend.

590
01:08:31,155 --> 01:08:32,850
I think maybe...

591
01:08:33,424 --> 01:08:34,857
...she might have...

592
01:08:38,196 --> 01:08:41,165
She might have AIDS.

593
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:47,962
And also...

594
01:08:50,308 --> 01:08:53,675
...a friend's mother is sick.

595
01:08:55,780 --> 01:08:57,179
Very sick.

596
01:08:58,182 --> 01:09:00,446
Bring her in to be tested.

597
01:09:01,285 --> 01:09:04,118
If it turns out positive...

598
01:09:04,489 --> 01:09:09,256
...we'll put her on our list
for treatment.

599
01:09:13,130 --> 01:09:16,156
- Is there a chance?
- A chance?

600
01:09:16,367 --> 01:09:18,801
There's always a chance.

601
01:09:27,545 --> 01:09:29,410
I need to use your phone.

602
01:09:34,218 --> 01:09:35,685
Think your mother wants you...

603
01:09:35,853 --> 01:09:38,413
...living with that whore?
- She'll understand.

604
01:09:38,589 --> 01:09:41,888
She'd want me to get her babies
away from her.

605
01:09:42,059 --> 01:09:44,027
Like they took away Esther's family?

606
01:09:44,228 --> 01:09:46,753
I don't care if she sleeps in a pigsty!

607
01:09:46,931 --> 01:09:48,626
She's staying!

608
01:09:49,333 --> 01:09:52,427
- And Soly and Iris are too!
- You think you're so smart?

609
01:09:52,670 --> 01:09:54,934
Satan is speaking
through your mouth!

610
01:09:55,106 --> 01:09:58,735
Let me call my mother.
She'll say if it's Satan or me!

611
01:09:58,910 --> 01:10:04,041
As long as that slut is in your house
you won't speak to your mother!

612
01:10:04,248 --> 01:10:06,148
Then I'll buy my own phone.

613
01:10:06,317 --> 01:10:09,753
- With what?
- I'll tell Mama everything you said.

614
01:10:09,954 --> 01:10:14,357
That I have to do what Esther does
to buy my own phone.

615
01:10:14,559 --> 01:10:15,992
I'll tell everyone.

616
01:10:20,097 --> 01:10:24,261
One night with her,
and look how you talk!

617
01:10:24,735 --> 01:10:25,963
Jezebel!

618
01:10:26,137 --> 01:10:30,938
Use the phone, and go to the devil!
See how far you get!

619
01:10:42,219 --> 01:10:43,914
Mr. Kamwendo?

620
01:10:44,422 --> 01:10:45,889
It's Chanda.

621
01:10:46,891 --> 01:10:48,119
Yes.

622
01:10:48,993 --> 01:10:50,654
May I speak to my mother?

623
01:10:55,566 --> 01:10:57,158
Could you give her a message?

624
01:10:57,768 --> 01:10:59,827
Ask her to call me back.

625
01:11:00,271 --> 01:11:02,296
I need to speak to her.

626
01:11:08,913 --> 01:11:12,849
Come home. Dinner's ready.

627
01:11:15,453 --> 01:11:18,889
- Where's Iris?
- I left her there.

628
01:11:20,591 --> 01:11:23,355
Iris! Iris!

629
01:11:26,797 --> 01:11:29,891
Soly, you dummy,
you left without any candy.

630
01:11:30,768 --> 01:11:33,703
Come here. Come when I call you.

631
01:11:34,372 --> 01:11:37,000
I'll come when I want. Or not at all.

632
01:11:38,376 --> 01:11:41,812
Stop that right now!
Do as you're told!

633
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:45,644
- Now, you listen to me.
- Leave me alone.

634
01:11:46,183 --> 01:11:47,650
You're not my mother!

635
01:11:48,185 --> 01:11:51,154
I want to stay with Papa! I hate you!

636
01:12:51,615 --> 01:12:53,344
Come, sit down.

637
01:13:05,629 --> 01:13:09,190
Look, give it your best shot.

638
01:13:11,102 --> 01:13:13,127
You'll get a second chance.

639
01:13:37,294 --> 01:13:40,627
- You're not at Mrs. Tafa's?
- She's busy.

640
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:46,136
- Seen Iris?
- She must be at Mrs. Tafa's.

641
01:13:46,337 --> 01:13:50,865
- Soly says Mrs. Tafa is busy.
- And your exam?

642
01:14:00,518 --> 01:14:02,349
What's the matter?

643
01:14:05,256 --> 01:14:07,349
I've disappointed everyone.

644
01:14:09,627 --> 01:14:11,993
Not me.

645
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:16,031
You'll get another chance.

646
01:14:16,767 --> 01:14:18,132
I'm sure you'll pass.

647
01:14:21,872 --> 01:14:24,568
Chanda! Chanda.

648
01:14:26,210 --> 01:14:30,014
There's been an accident.
Come quick!

649
01:14:34,051 --> 01:14:37,145
- Hello, ma'am.
- She's the girl's sister.

650
01:14:37,354 --> 01:14:43,020
Apparently they all drank beer
and they fell into that hole.

651
01:14:43,194 --> 01:14:45,924
Jacob! What happened?

652
01:14:46,096 --> 01:14:51,398
Iris was leaning over the hole
speaking to Sarah.

653
01:14:51,602 --> 01:14:53,331
Paulo wanted to see Sarah.

654
01:14:53,537 --> 01:14:55,937
They lowered him on a rope.

655
01:14:56,106 --> 01:14:57,767
And he fell in.

656
01:14:58,008 --> 01:14:59,999
Iris sent us to get help.

657
01:15:00,244 --> 01:15:03,236
Iris! Iris! Iris!

658
01:15:04,381 --> 01:15:06,281
Let them do their job.

659
01:15:30,975 --> 01:15:32,442
Chanda!

660
01:15:46,724 --> 01:15:47,884
Where are you going?

661
01:15:56,433 --> 01:15:57,798
What are you doing?

662
01:15:58,569 --> 01:16:00,560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

663
01:16:00,771 --> 01:16:02,739
I won't be bad again.

664
01:16:07,478 --> 01:16:10,447
I know. I know.

665
01:16:10,981 --> 01:16:12,608
We found him!

666
01:16:24,995 --> 01:16:27,520
You're alive, I was so frightened!

667
01:16:28,098 --> 01:16:30,089
Something cushioned his fall.

668
01:16:31,035 --> 01:16:33,503
Now move back, all of you.

669
01:17:17,247 --> 01:17:19,374
Why didn't Mama come?

670
01:17:20,551 --> 01:17:22,542
She wanted to say goodbye.

671
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:25,786
Then why isn't she here?

672
01:17:29,526 --> 01:17:31,892
Maybe she didn't get the message.

673
01:17:37,368 --> 01:17:39,836
It's a crying shame.

674
01:17:41,472 --> 01:17:43,940
He was still so young.

675
01:17:45,342 --> 01:17:46,934
A horrible accident!

676
01:17:48,379 --> 01:17:50,438
Imagine falling into a hole like that?

677
01:17:50,681 --> 01:17:52,672
He never stood a chance!

678
01:18:16,206 --> 01:18:17,901
Mama should have been here.

679
01:18:18,475 --> 01:18:20,204
I don't see why.

680
01:18:21,345 --> 01:18:24,246
- She loved him.
- That cheater?

681
01:18:24,448 --> 01:18:28,908
That useless drunk
who put her to shame?

682
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:31,110
His accident won't change anything.

683
01:18:35,993 --> 01:18:37,426
It was no accident.

684
01:18:38,295 --> 01:18:39,592
What do you mean?

685
01:18:39,763 --> 01:18:44,063
Jonah either fell or was pushed
because he had AIDS.

686
01:18:46,136 --> 01:18:48,900
If you say that Jonah had the bug...

687
01:18:49,106 --> 01:18:51,336
...people will say
your mama has it too.

688
01:18:51,508 --> 01:18:55,467
- They're already saying it.
- No one's saying it.

689
01:18:58,715 --> 01:19:00,615
- You sure?
- They think your mother...

690
01:19:00,784 --> 01:19:02,115
...was bewitched...

691
01:19:02,286 --> 01:19:04,811
...and that Jonah had an accident.
The truth.

692
01:19:05,289 --> 01:19:08,747
- It's not true.
- It's what they think!

693
01:19:08,926 --> 01:19:11,486
That lie made my mother leave.

694
01:19:11,962 --> 01:19:15,056
- Your lies!
- My lies?

695
01:19:17,868 --> 01:19:23,238
You convinced Mama to leave
because you're scared of the bug.

696
01:19:23,407 --> 01:19:25,432
And scared of what folks will say.

697
01:19:25,642 --> 01:19:27,109
Why shouldn't we be?

698
01:19:27,311 --> 01:19:32,010
Your mother never meant
to come home. She's gone for good!

699
01:19:44,128 --> 01:19:48,497
When I get home I'll pack my bags.
I'm going to Tiro to fetch Mama.

700
01:19:49,233 --> 01:19:53,294
- I won't let you go.
- Try stopping me!

701
01:19:58,709 --> 01:20:01,200
Fine, go ahead and break
your mama's heart...

702
01:20:01,411 --> 01:20:04,574
...and your own while you're at it!

703
01:20:39,850 --> 01:20:41,112
Here's 500 rands.

704
01:20:42,619 --> 01:20:45,087
It was to bring back
my brothers and sister.

705
01:20:46,223 --> 01:20:48,885
It's not enough. Take it.

706
01:20:50,294 --> 01:20:51,591
I can't take it.

707
01:20:52,129 --> 01:20:57,726
- Why? Because it's from whoring?
- Of course not.

708
01:20:59,603 --> 01:21:01,366
You saved my life.

709
01:21:02,706 --> 01:21:05,800
If you hadn't taken me in, I'd be dead.

710
01:21:07,711 --> 01:21:09,303
Please.

711
01:22:07,504 --> 01:22:09,438
Mr. Kamwendo.

712
01:22:11,008 --> 01:22:12,305
I'm Chanda.

713
01:22:13,043 --> 01:22:14,271
Look at you.

714
01:22:14,478 --> 01:22:19,245
Last time I saw you, you were so high.
How you've grown.

715
01:22:25,889 --> 01:22:31,350
I'm sorry to hear
about your stepfather.

716
01:22:31,895 --> 01:22:35,387
- You came to see your grandmother?
- No.

717
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:37,728
I came to see Mama.

718
01:22:40,837 --> 01:22:45,797
I called last week.
I asked you to leave a message.

719
01:22:47,678 --> 01:22:50,670
- Is something wrong?
- No, child.

720
01:22:51,882 --> 01:22:53,713
But she's not here.

721
01:22:54,651 --> 01:23:00,214
I passed your message on,
but your Aunt Lizbet said...

722
01:23:00,424 --> 01:23:02,915
...your mother had left.

723
01:23:04,528 --> 01:23:09,932
- I don't understand.
- Your grandma came...

724
01:23:10,167 --> 01:23:13,659
...and left a message for Mrs. Tafa.

725
01:23:13,837 --> 01:23:17,534
- Didn't you get it?
- No.

726
01:23:22,913 --> 01:23:27,543
Your grandmother
lives over that way.

727
01:23:27,751 --> 01:23:30,242
It's shorter
if you cut through the fields.

728
01:23:34,124 --> 01:23:35,716
Thank you.

729
01:23:52,709 --> 01:23:54,267
Hello?

730
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:58,209
It's Chanda.

731
01:24:01,952 --> 01:24:03,385
What are you doing here?

732
01:24:03,587 --> 01:24:06,420
- I came to see Mama.
- She left.

733
01:24:06,923 --> 01:24:11,360
I called last week.
Mr. Kamwendo told me she left.

734
01:24:12,429 --> 01:24:14,454
She didn't come home.
Where is she?

735
01:24:14,931 --> 01:24:17,229
In Polokwane, with friends.

736
01:24:17,601 --> 01:24:19,091
Their car broke down.

737
01:24:19,302 --> 01:24:21,930
She'll be back when it's fixed.
Maybe a week.

738
01:24:22,105 --> 01:24:24,903
How'd you find out? Did she call?

739
01:24:25,075 --> 01:24:27,009
Are you calling me a liar?

740
01:24:29,646 --> 01:24:31,079
Get in here!

741
01:24:32,249 --> 01:24:35,446
- Where's Mama?
- Go home, she'll be back soon.

742
01:24:35,619 --> 01:24:37,814
I don't believe you.
I'm going to the police!

743
01:24:37,988 --> 01:24:40,513
You're trouble. Like your mother.

744
01:24:40,690 --> 01:24:43,955
She defied God,
she dishonored her family...

745
01:24:44,161 --> 01:24:46,629
...and now the ancestors
have disowned her.

746
01:24:46,797 --> 01:24:49,459
- Is she dead?
- She has the disease.

747
01:24:49,966 --> 01:24:51,456
Divine punishment.

748
01:24:51,635 --> 01:24:55,628
It's no more punishment
than your club foot.

749
01:24:56,973 --> 01:24:58,668
What sin did you commit?

750
01:25:00,410 --> 01:25:02,776
- It's God's wrath!
- What do you know?

751
01:25:03,980 --> 01:25:05,607
Lizbet!

752
01:25:06,516 --> 01:25:07,744
Enough.

753
01:25:09,219 --> 01:25:10,709
That's enough.

754
01:25:11,888 --> 01:25:16,518
She has the disease.
We kept her for a while.

755
01:25:16,693 --> 01:25:18,661
But she's very sick.

756
01:25:18,829 --> 01:25:22,287
We hid her where the illness
won't harm the family.

757
01:25:24,534 --> 01:25:27,662
She's always shamed the family,
even in death.

758
01:25:27,871 --> 01:25:29,805
Where is she?

759
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:05,531
Mama!

760
01:27:06,102 --> 01:27:07,569
Mama!

761
01:27:09,039 --> 01:27:10,529
Mama!

762
01:28:02,826 --> 01:28:04,487
Don't worry, Mama.

763
01:28:05,395 --> 01:28:07,056
I'm with you.

764
01:28:16,206 --> 01:28:18,106
I'm with you.

765
01:28:29,252 --> 01:28:30,981
Chanda.

766
01:28:35,258 --> 01:28:36,919
I'm lost.

767
01:28:37,927 --> 01:28:42,387
Don't worry. I've come to get you.

768
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:45,691
We're going home.

769
01:29:41,558 --> 01:29:43,116
Mrs. Tafa.

770
01:29:44,561 --> 01:29:46,495
How are you today?

771
01:30:34,978 --> 01:30:37,640
Easy does it.

772
01:31:31,668 --> 01:31:33,135
Thank you.

773
01:32:14,344 --> 01:32:16,437
You're bringing us trouble.

774
01:32:20,383 --> 01:32:22,374
You're bringing us trouble.

775
01:32:29,459 --> 01:32:32,724
It's her fault.
The curse is that slut's fault!

776
01:32:35,865 --> 01:32:39,096
You're bringing trouble to us all!

777
01:34:13,229 --> 01:34:14,662
Welcome back.

778
01:34:18,568 --> 01:34:24,165
I don't know what you're doing here.
I've come to greet my friend Lillian.

779
01:34:32,015 --> 01:34:33,414
You have a problem with that?

780
01:34:40,990 --> 01:34:43,424
I know what goes on
behind your doors.

781
01:34:45,228 --> 01:34:47,890
This is the best family here.

782
01:34:49,399 --> 01:34:54,063
If any of you disagree,
I'd be happy to share your secrets.

783
01:34:59,909 --> 01:35:02,901
Lillian needs your prayers.
Will you pray for her?

784
01:35:25,435 --> 01:35:26,663
We'll pray for her.

785
01:35:28,237 --> 01:35:30,705
We're glad you're back.

786
01:35:30,940 --> 01:35:32,237
It's true.

787
01:35:53,563 --> 01:35:55,497
May I see your mother?

788
01:36:38,975 --> 01:36:40,636
Forgive me.

789
01:36:48,618 --> 01:36:53,146
Your mother and I
wanted to protect you from shame.

790
01:37:01,497 --> 01:37:04,728
- I know.
- No.

791
01:37:05,968 --> 01:37:07,560
You don't know.

792
01:37:13,042 --> 01:37:15,704
I only thought of myself.

793
01:37:22,218 --> 01:37:24,709
Letting her die like that.

794
01:37:25,254 --> 01:37:27,586
People know we're friends.

795
01:37:37,700 --> 01:37:39,759
When the ambulance arrived...

796
01:37:41,671 --> 01:37:43,332
...I went and hid.

797
01:37:45,508 --> 01:37:46,907
I prayed.

798
01:37:49,712 --> 01:37:50,940
I prayed.

799
01:37:54,584 --> 01:37:58,213
But it was for my son.

800
01:37:59,522 --> 01:38:00,580
Why is that?

801
01:38:03,593 --> 01:38:07,029
My son wasn't killed in a robbery.

802
01:38:12,935 --> 01:38:16,336
He was so afraid
people wouldn't love him anymore.

803
01:38:18,441 --> 01:38:19,772
That's just crazy.

804
01:38:22,645 --> 01:38:24,306
You think so?

805
01:38:27,950 --> 01:38:32,353
I dishonored his death with a lie.

806
01:38:51,407 --> 01:38:53,500
What a daughter you have.

807
01:38:54,810 --> 01:38:56,607
What a daughter.

808
01:39:22,004 --> 01:39:25,531
<i>The gates are opening</i>

809
01:39:38,321 --> 01:39:41,848
<i>The gates are opening</i>

810
01:39:54,203 --> 01:39:57,036
<i>We come from suffering</i>

811
01:39:58,007 --> 01:40:00,373
<i>And we confessed our sins</i>

812
01:40:01,344 --> 01:40:04,074
<i>And they repented</i>

813
01:40:25,234 --> 01:40:29,000
<i>The gates of heaven are open</i>
