00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:58,009

00:01:59,913 --> 00:02:02,489
No, no that's not true,

12
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:05,219
You're the one that wanted him
to go to a private school, not me.

13
00:02:05,606 --> 00:02:08,037
Then put Knuckles on the phone.

14
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,839
Then tell him it's a two-way street,
I call him, he's gotta call me.

15
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:17,440
Oh, he's my son now?

16
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,261
Because you want him to go to...

You call me at 7 o'clock
in the morning in Orlando

19
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,224
to shake me down for
fuckin' money. That's great.

20
00:02:32,224 --> 00:02:34,735
Does he even wanna go
to the fuckin' school?

21
00:02:38,152 --> 00:02:39,563

I'll be in Atlanta and I meet him.

23
00:02:45,592 --> 00:02:46,973
How am I a liar?

24
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:50,283
Yeah, but how does that make me a liar?

25
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:52,653

00:07:02,971 --> 00:07:04,922
Don't pick-up.

86
00:07:10,407 --> 00:07:11,807
<i>Hello?</i>

87
00:07:12,338 --> 00:07:14,401
Hi, it's Nic, do you have any?

88
00:07:17,227 --> 00:07:18,185
Cute.

89
00:07:18,185 --> 00:07:20,626
Hey baby, come here, how are you?

90
00:07:20,891 --> 00:07:23,798
It's good to see you.
Nicole, this is Tiki Pot.

91
00:07:23,798 --> 00:07:26,666
Tiki is my partner in this new series,
he knows a lot of porn.

92
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:27,942
Look, I have two grams.

93
00:07:27,942 --> 00:07:30,636
We are putting the narrative
back in the porn, baby, and...

94
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:33,093
Desdemona.

95
00:07:33,093 --> 00:07:36,201
You could totally play Desdemona.
Look at you. You're perfect.

96
00:07:36,201 --> 00:07:38,356
Fuck yeah, you're perfect.
Let's... beautiful.

She do anal, 2000 one hour.

98
00:07:40,595 --> 00:07:42,595
Alright, I don't do porn, Kip.

99
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,655
- Okay, listen.
– Just... let me see the "h".

100
00:07:44,655 --> 00:07:45,910
– It's an Othello theme, okay,

101
00:07:46,128 --> 00:07:48,671
the Moor comes in, finds you
in bed upon his nurses...

102
00:07:48,671 --> 00:07:50,717
And he fucks me in the ass, huh?

103
00:07:50,717 --> 00:07:52,766
College student. Very clean. Brett?

104
00:07:52,766 --> 00:07:55,118
Wait, we're puttin' a whole new spin on
"The beast with two backs", baby.

105
00:07:55,118 --> 00:07:56,291
In fact, that's what it's called,

106
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,698
"The beast with two backs"...
– Is that why you told me

107
00:07:57,698 --> 00:08:00,315
you had somebody handling it.
– .. or "Hole-thello", or "Butt-hole thello".

108
00:08:00,315 --> 00:08:02,546
Show her the pipe, huh?

109
00:08:04,742 --> 00:08:06,540
Tiki, that's your name?

110
00:08:07,798 --> 00:08:10,991
Why n'you shove that in your ass
and you call me in the morning?

111
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,695
Hey, Nicole.
Nicole!

112
00:08:13,517 --> 00:08:16,249
Hey slow down. Slow down!
Nic, I am sorry. Alright? We're tweaked.

113
00:08:16,249 --> 00:08:17,502
Okay, I am sorry.

114
00:08:17,502 --> 00:08:19,602
Just stick around, it's not a big deal,

115
00:08:19,602 --> 00:08:22,125
you gonna take some
stills for me or something.

116
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,928
What's going on with you?
I thought you were clean?

117
00:08:24,928 --> 00:08:28,553
And now you're... you're
like freaking out on me.

118
00:08:29,224 --> 00:08:30,597
Com'on.

119
00:08:30,813 --> 00:08:32,271
Don't cry.

120
00:08:32,522 --> 00:08:33,642
I...

121
00:08:33,965 --> 00:08:36,326
I just want to get faded, Kip.

122
00:08:37,343 --> 00:08:40,786
I have a hundred, please.
– No, keep it, keep it.

123
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:42,661
I don't want it, okay?

124
00:08:43,009 --> 00:08:44,778
Listen.

125
00:08:45,027 --> 00:08:46,733
This is the 'Taliban', okay?

126
00:08:47,245 --> 00:08:49,858
Very heavy, okay?
– I can handle it.

127
00:08:50,231 --> 00:08:53,033
I don't want you shooting this shit,
it's too heavy, alright?

128
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,482
I won't. I promise.

129
00:08:57,286 --> 00:09:00,807
I'm just gonna smoke it out.
I haven't... used needles in weeks.

130
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:05,115
Okay. No needles.
And if you get a little too low...

131
00:09:05,115 --> 00:09:07,546
you just do a little coke, okay,
get yourself back up.

132
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:10,905
Right where you need to be. Alright?

133
00:09:10,905 --> 00:09:13,826
– Yeah... Thanks.
– Okay baby.

134
00:09:13,826 --> 00:09:16,737
<i>.. and that all your carry-on items are
safely stored in the overhead bin,</i>

135
00:09:16,737 --> 00:09:18,459

136
00:09:18,459 --> 00:09:21,797
<i>Also all electronic devices must
be turned off at this time.</i>

137
00:09:21,797 --> 00:09:24,877
Our flight time to Atlanta
is approximately 52 minutes,

138
00:09:24,877 --> 00:09:27,164
flight attendants, take your seat.

139
00:09:29,463 --> 00:09:32,427
So what'd you do last night?
I crashed and went straight to bed.

140
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,447
All right, here we go.

141
00:09:37,075 --> 00:09:39,150
Engine instruments, sir in the green.

142
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,721
Air speed's alive both side,

143
00:09:41,721 --> 00:09:43,579
80 knots, crosscheck.

144
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:45,506
It's like a video game, right?

145
00:09:48,723 --> 00:09:54,553
Nothin' like a little... 30 knot cross
wind to exercise the ol' sphincter muscle.

146
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:56,281
E1...

147
00:09:56,772 --> 00:09:58,773
and rotate.

148
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:03,095
We're to positive rate.

149
00:10:03,388 --> 00:10:04,612
Gear up.

150
00:10:05,776 --> 00:10:08,812
Yeehaw! Ride ‘em cowboy.

Then I suggest to stretch out and relax,

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,426
Okay. On the count at three,
I want you to pull it up,

311
00:20:44,426 --> 00:20:46,376
turn it clockwise, push it back down.

312
00:20:46,376 --> 00:20:49,651
Ready?
One, two, three.

313
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:54,329
That's okay, it's okay.

314
00:20:54,725 --> 00:20:56,977
Aah, come on!

315
00:20:57,668 --> 00:21:00,418
Right, okay.
Okay, it goes up.

316
00:21:01,439 --> 00:21:02,559
Shit!

317
00:21:04,238 --> 00:21:06,512
Cami! Cami!

318
00:21:08,294 --> 00:21:09,458
Margaret!

319
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:13,376
Oh, Lord. We're coming under 7000,
I see nothing but houses!

320
00:21:13,376 --> 00:21:14,619
Evans, listen to me.

321
00:21:14,619 --> 00:21:17,768
When I say, I want you to retract
the flaps, retract the gears,

322
00:21:17,768 --> 00:21:21,039
trim us nose down, okay, whatever
you think's, gonna be the opposite,

323
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,045
so make sure you trim us nose down.

324
00:21:23,045 --> 00:21:24,326
I trim down, what you gonna do?

325
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:26,959
Margaret. When I tell you,
I want you to push this forward.

326
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:28,614
Full power, full throttle,
can you do that?

327
00:21:28,614 --> 00:21:29,933
– Yeah. Okay.
– Okay. When I tell you.

328
00:21:29,933 --> 00:21:31,933
Wait, wait sir. What do we do,
and why would I trim down?

329
00:21:31,933 --> 00:21:34,479
– We're gonna roll it. Okay?
– What do you mean, rolling?

330
00:21:34,479 --> 00:21:36,112
We gotta do something to stop this dive.

331
00:21:36,112 --> 00:21:38,135
Margaret, what's your son's name?

332
00:21:38,135 --> 00:21:38,852
Trevor.

333
00:21:38,852 --> 00:21:40,178
– Say "I love you, Trevor".
– What?

334
00:21:40,178 --> 00:21:41,541
The black box, say "I love you Trevor".

335
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:44,608
I love you Trevor, you be a good boy.
Mommy loves you.

336
00:21:44,608 --> 00:21:46,650
Okay, here we go.
I've got control.

337
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:50,884
Oh, Lord Jesus!

338
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,957
– Alright Evans, flaps.
– Flaps!

339
00:21:54,957 --> 00:21:56,884
– Speed brakes.
– Speed brakes!

340
00:22:06,084 --> 00:22:08,451
Margaret. Power!

341
00:22:10,686 --> 00:22:13,015
– Gear up.
– Gear up!

342
00:22:32,581 --> 00:22:34,578
Oh Lord Jesus, we're inverted!

343
00:22:34,578 --> 00:22:37,394
Good flying lesson. We’re level,
we can maintain altitude like this.

344
00:22:37,765 --> 00:22:40,219
<i>SouthJet 2-2-7, Atlanta Center,
I see your position</i>

345
00:22:40,219 --> 00:22:41,950
<i>4 and a half miles
southeast of the airport,</i>

346
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:43,371
<i>descending out of 1,800. Are you OK?</i>

347
00:22:43,371 --> 00:22:45,959
Atlanta Center, this is SouthJet 2-2-7,

348
00:22:45,959 --> 00:22:48,646
we are inverted, I repeat we are inverted.

349
00:22:48,646 --> 00:22:51,175
<i>SoutJet 2-2-7, did you say inverted?</i>

350
00:22:51,175 --> 00:22:53,592
We're losing oil pressure,
pump failure both engines!

351
00:22:53,592 --> 00:22:54,955
We're alright, we're flying.

352
00:23:05,431 --> 00:23:06,543
– Fire in the left engine!

353
00:23:06,543 --> 00:23:08,544
– Fire in the left engine!
– Put it out.

354
00:23:10,951 --> 00:23:13,699
I'm right with you. Look at me,
I'm right with you. Okay?

355
00:23:13,699 --> 00:23:16,528
Atlanta, SouthJet 2-2-7,
where's that airport?

356
00:23:16,528 --> 00:23:19,278
<i>2-2-7, it is one O'clock, three miles.</i>

357
00:23:19,278 --> 00:23:21,814
Alright, we're not gonna make that,
our engines are burning up.

358
00:23:21,814 --> 00:23:25,381
I see a field and a road ahead of us,
we're gonna set it down there.

359
00:23:25,381 --> 00:23:26,832
<i>Roger, 2-2-7.</i>

360
00:23:26,832 --> 00:23:28,440
Oh no, fire in the right, now!

361
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,151
Margaret, we're coming back around.

362
00:23:30,151 --> 00:23:33,539
Margaret, I want you to hit full power,
full throttle, you understand?

363
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:35,272
Here we go.

364
00:23:35,537 --> 00:23:37,146
Evans, speed brakes.

365
00:23:37,498 --> 00:23:38,767
Speed brakes!

366
00:23:38,767 --> 00:23:40,920
– Flaps full.
– Flaps full.

367
00:23:58,339 --> 00:23:59,909
We're losing the left engine.

368
00:23:59,909 --> 00:24:03,840
<i>SouthJet 2-2-7, I see you descending
through 1000, do you concur?</i>

369
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,056
Margaret, full power.

370
00:24:16,382 --> 00:24:17,856
We lost the left engine!

371
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:18,731
– Let it go.

372
00:24:18,731 --> 00:24:20,692
– Let it go.
– We're losing power in the right!

373
00:24:22,935 --> 00:24:24,805
We lost all power!

374
00:24:24,805 --> 00:24:26,399
<i>TOO LOW TERRAIN</i>

375
00:24:26,821 --> 00:24:28,196
<i>TOO LOW TERRAIN</i>

376
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:30,454
<i>TOO LOW TERRAIN</i>

377
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:32,953
Are we gliding?

378
00:24:33,962 --> 00:24:36,422
We're in glide. Pitch for glide.

379
00:24:42,654 --> 00:24:44,654
<i>One hundred.</i>

380
00:24:50,025 --> 00:24:51,241
<i>Fifty.</i>

381
00:24:53,703 --> 00:24:54,823
<i>Forty.</i>

382
00:24:55,124 --> 00:24:56,244
<i>Thirty.</i>

383
00:24:56,731 --> 00:24:57,656
<i>Twenty.</i>

384
00:24:57,656 --> 00:24:59,416
<i>– Brace.
- Ten.</i>

385
00:24:59,628 --> 00:25:01,162
Brace for impact.

386
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,493
I got the pilot.

387
00:25:17,493 --> 00:25:19,797
Somebody, give me a hand here.

388
00:25:20,446 --> 00:25:23,545
Ooh, god, god.

389
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:34,149
Charlie Anderson?

390
00:27:40,651 --> 00:27:42,430
How you feelin', Whip?

391
00:27:44,841 --> 00:27:48,436
Initial reports look like you pulled
some kind of move up there, man.

392
00:27:48,814 --> 00:27:50,552
You saved a lot of lives.

393
00:27:51,671 --> 00:27:53,071
How many?

394
00:27:53,872 --> 00:27:55,737
On the 102 souls on board,

395
00:27:55,737 --> 00:27:58,733
including the flight crew,
96 of them survived the crash.

396
00:28:01,281 --> 00:28:05,438
Six people died.
Two crew, four passengers.

397
00:28:07,408 --> 00:28:09,638
Who... who on the crew?

398
00:28:14,627 --> 00:28:16,757
– Listen. The protocol is-
– Who in the crew, Charlie?

399
00:28:17,193 --> 00:28:19,359
The protocol is that the NTSB has to be

400
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:21,476
the first to make contact
with you, I can't...

401
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:24,709
And their agent's here, so...

402
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:27,924
Let me go get him, it's a bit of a show.

403
00:28:28,193 --> 00:28:31,899
So there's... half
a dozen of them. Alright.

404
00:28:35,139 --> 00:28:37,949
Hey Craig. Morning.

405
00:28:50,691 --> 00:28:53,420
Captain William Whitaker?

406
00:28:53,916 --> 00:28:56,589
Nod if you can hear me and understand me.

407
00:28:57,109 --> 00:28:59,927
I'm Craig Matson of the NT... NTSB,

408
00:28:59,927 --> 00:29:02,419
and I am required as
the lead on the Go Team

409
00:29:02,419 --> 00:29:04,096
to make initial contact with you,

410
00:29:04,096 --> 00:29:07,221
after a major incident
like the one you had today.

411
00:29:08,487 --> 00:29:11,385
You are in a hospital,
in South Atlanta.

412
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:17,104
Are you aware that the plane
you were piloting went down?

413
00:29:19,933 --> 00:29:22,931
I have a doctor here who can
explain the medical situation.

414
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:27,974
I'm Dr. Kenan. And the good news is,
you're in good condition.

415
00:29:28,385 --> 00:29:30,094
You did suffer concussion,

416
00:29:30,094 --> 00:29:32,735
you have numerous lacerations
around your left eye,

417
00:29:32,735 --> 00:29:35,913
we're going to keep the patch on just
for a few days, just as a precaution.

418
00:29:35,913 --> 00:29:38,283
Your eye seems to be okay.

419
00:29:38,283 --> 00:29:40,708
Now the MRI’s show that you
have some strained tendons

420
00:29:40,708 --> 00:29:45,041
in your left knee and ankle,
and you have no broken bones,

421
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:47,859
but you have some deep bruising
in your left thigh, and some

422
00:29:47,859 --> 00:29:51,205
torn ligaments in your
left wrist. Nothing serious.

423
00:29:51,205 --> 00:29:53,480
So, as soon as we clear your concussion,

424
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,791
and you feel well enough,
you can go home.

425
00:29:55,791 --> 00:30:00,026
That may take a day, maybe three.
Okay?

426
00:30:03,987 --> 00:30:08,025
I won’t ask too much of you
tonight, but as I said,

427
00:30:08,025 --> 00:30:11,984
the NTSB is required
to make initial contact.

428
00:30:13,419 --> 00:30:16,849
How much do you remember about the flight?

429
00:30:18,847 --> 00:30:20,932
Uh, I remember...

430
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,080
I remember everything up to the crash.

431
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,588
Okay... Mr. Whitaker, that’s fine.

432
00:30:30,413 --> 00:30:34,795
I am required to inform you that this
incident did result in the loss of life.

433
00:30:36,676 --> 00:30:41,861
The current information states that
of the 102 souls on board, we lost 6.

434
00:30:42,268 --> 00:30:44,516
Two crew members, and four passengers.

435
00:30:45,061 --> 00:30:47,177
59 people were treated and released.

436
00:30:47,177 --> 00:30:48,549
37 people remain-

437
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:50,282
– Who died on the crew?

438
00:30:50,607 --> 00:30:56,236
The two flight attendants...
Camelia Satou and Katerina Marquez.

439
00:30:58,592 --> 00:31:02,816
The rep from your Pilot’s Union,
Mr. Anderson, will be our contact for you,

440
00:31:02,816 --> 00:31:07,587
it’s important that you follow your
Union’s guidance on press and media.

441
00:31:08,211 --> 00:31:11,372
The pilot’s union works
closely with the NTSB.

442
00:31:11,674 --> 00:31:16,641
So... I’m gonna head out.
Good luck, Mr. Whitaker.

443
00:31:29,582 --> 00:31:32,619
I knew Trina Marquez, she was...

444
00:31:33,822 --> 00:31:35,681
We spent some time together.

445
00:31:35,932 --> 00:31:38,449
Yeah, apparently she was not strapped in.

446
00:31:39,608 --> 00:31:42,564
Survivor reported
she was assisting a kid.

447
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:45,425
And Margaret Thomason, how's she doing?

448
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:49,970
Broken collarbone. Just, um, cuts,
I mean she's banged up, but she’s...

449
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:52,134
she's here too, she's fine.

450
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,671
And Ken Evans, your copilot, he-he...

451
00:31:55,671 --> 00:31:58,057
he took a bad shot to the head.

452
00:31:58,392 --> 00:32:01,926
And now they’re keepin’ him in a coma
just to let the brain swelling go down,

453
00:32:01,926 --> 00:32:05,101
but we feel good about him.
He’s gonna be okay.

454
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:10,814
What are you doing here, Charlie?

455
00:32:12,042 --> 00:32:13,655
I’m flying a desk now.

456
00:32:14,203 --> 00:32:16,196
I’m a rep for the pilot's Union.

457
00:32:16,613 --> 00:32:18,191
You’re the rep for the pilots’?

458
00:32:18,191 --> 00:32:21,550
Yeah, I'm the one, and when your plane
went down, all the reps got a page

459
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:25,260
and I just shot up my hand cause
I know you and said I wanted to

460
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,940
come and be the first face you’d see.

461
00:32:28,511 --> 00:32:30,188
I'm glad you're here.

462
00:32:30,466 --> 00:32:33,096
The Union's gonna release
a statement on your behalf.

463
00:32:33,456 --> 00:32:36,004
Condolences to the families
who lost their loved ones,

464
00:32:36,004 --> 00:32:38,835
gratitude to the brave men
and women of the flight crew.

465
00:32:39,386 --> 00:32:41,577
That's-you don't have to worry about that.

466
00:32:42,636 --> 00:32:45,141
And I know you and Deana have
been divorced for a while now,

467
00:32:45,141 --> 00:32:46,778
but maybe she and your son Will gonna-

468
00:32:46,778 --> 00:32:48,654
Yes, Knuckles...

469
00:32:50,952 --> 00:32:52,684
How old is he now?

470
00:32:52,684 --> 00:32:54,415
Too old. Fifteen.

471
00:32:54,891 --> 00:32:57,020
– Fiteen? Wow.
– Yeah.

472
00:32:57,911 --> 00:33:00,332
When we flew out for Delta,
you were not even married.

473
00:33:00,965 --> 00:33:03,588
We're dinosaurs, Whip.

474
00:33:06,273 --> 00:33:08,731
Do you want me to reach out to Deana?

475
00:33:09,047 --> 00:33:11,717
And see if... she and Will
want to come down or...?

476
00:33:11,717 --> 00:33:13,195
No, I don't want.

477
00:33:13,797 --> 00:33:15,166
I’ll call her.

478
00:33:15,629 --> 00:33:17,560
Well, speaking of which, I got your phone.

479
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:21,193
And the whole bunch of your
personnal effect from the plane.

480
00:33:21,193 --> 00:33:23,052
Your clothes are toast.

481
00:33:24,954 --> 00:33:26,844
Uh, do you...

482
00:33:27,191 --> 00:33:30,634
Do you need me to...
to get you some stuff?

483
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:32,725
Nah, 'bout okay.

484
00:33:33,086 --> 00:33:35,492
Charlie, I'm uh...

485
00:33:37,376 --> 00:33:39,661
Damn, I'm glad you came.

486
00:33:40,105 --> 00:33:42,065
Okay, too.
I'm happy to be here.

487
00:33:43,943 --> 00:33:48,144
Well, I'm...
I'll let you get some rest and...

488
00:33:48,144 --> 00:33:50,193
but I'll come back, I mean,
you will see plenty of me.

489
00:33:50,193 --> 00:33:51,630
Sure you will.

490
00:33:53,753 --> 00:33:55,821
The plane was fucked, Charlie.

491
00:33:55,821 --> 00:33:57,344
It was doomed.

492
00:33:57,999 --> 00:33:59,720
I know.

493
00:34:00,603 --> 00:34:03,953
The way you landed that plane
was nothing short of a miracle.

494
00:34:04,328 --> 00:34:05,728
You know that.

495
00:34:08,542 --> 00:34:10,241
Alright, Captain.

496
00:34:10,241 --> 00:34:12,552
– Good night.
– Good night.

497
00:35:03,386 --> 00:35:06,203
I'm on the list, baby girl.
Mr. Mays...

498
00:35:07,018 --> 00:35:09,021
Harling.

499
00:35:13,262 --> 00:35:15,797
If this is gonna turn into a sponge bath,
I’ll come back later.

500
00:35:15,797 --> 00:35:16,942
Sir...

501
00:35:17,343 --> 00:35:20,551
It's alright, honey. I'm on the list.
Harling Mays.

502
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:22,722
Some say they Harling knew me.

503
00:35:22,969 --> 00:35:26,801
Honey, could you hustle us a couple
of daiquiris, and a cocktail weenie?

504
00:35:26,801 --> 00:35:29,378
On second thought just bring the
booze, I brought my own weenie.

505
00:35:29,378 --> 00:35:31,475
Ah, well she's offended
and she should be.

506
00:35:31,475 --> 00:35:33,708
I’m a pig.
And I hate me.

507
00:35:33,708 --> 00:35:37,744
That’s what we have in common
Nurse Ratched. We both hate me.

508
00:35:39,484 --> 00:35:40,575
Harling Mays.

509
00:35:40,919 --> 00:35:45,005
Whip, what the fuck my man?

510
00:35:45,697 --> 00:35:49,657
They’re sayin’, “Sweet Jesus,
what a stud that pilot is.”

511
00:35:49,657 --> 00:35:50,806
You’re a hero, man.

512
00:35:51,009 --> 00:35:54,327
You will never pay for
another drink as long as you live.

513
00:35:54,327 --> 00:35:56,596
There is all kind o' those
crazy news people out here,

514
00:35:56,596 --> 00:35:58,359
it's a fucking circus, man.

515
00:35:58,359 --> 00:36:00,866
Come on, check this shit out,
man, it's all for you.

516
00:36:01,604 --> 00:36:03,359
Look at this shit.

517
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:05,647
Classic hero worship shit.

518
00:36:05,647 --> 00:36:09,936
You're a rock star, man.
Oh, check out this video.

519
00:36:09,936 --> 00:36:12,166
This's outside your condo.
It's a zoo.

520
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:14,054
It crowded with reporters.

521
00:36:14,054 --> 00:36:15,098
Let's see, check this out.

522
00:36:15,098 --> 00:36:16,459
<i>Let's see, check this out.
So you do know Captain Whitaker,</i>

523
00:36:16,459 --> 00:36:17,061
<i>- you were friends?
– Com'on.</i>

524
00:36:17,061 --> 00:36:17,846
<i>Oh yeah.</i>

525
00:36:17,846 --> 00:36:18,977
<i>Yes, he's my brother.</i>

526
00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:20,113
<i>Yes, he's my brother.
– That's me.</i>

527
00:36:20,113 --> 00:36:23,026
And that‘s Mark Mellon, you know
that douchey talking haircut from

528
00:36:23,026 --> 00:36:25,427
local Atlanta channel 12?
I said a few words,

529
00:36:25,427 --> 00:36:27,200
you know most of ‘em straight talk.

530
00:36:27,779 --> 00:36:28,899
Oh!

531
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:30,506
You okay, Captain Whitaker?

532
00:36:30,506 --> 00:36:32,928
The meds they’re giving me,
they're messing me up, I’m all...

533
00:36:32,928 --> 00:36:35,405
shaky and dried out, I can’t sleep good.

534
00:36:35,405 --> 00:36:37,575
Yeah. What the hell kind
of meds they give you?

535
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,637
Alprazolam.

536
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:43,963
That's generic Xanax. Hydroconon,
that's generic Vicodin. It's shit.

537
00:36:43,963 --> 00:36:46,770
Prolly Canadian.
We don't want this shit.

538
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:50,491
We want the premium stuff, blue label.
Not this fucking well shit.

539
00:36:50,491 --> 00:36:52,853
I mean, where's the...
where’s the dihydromorphinone?

540
00:36:52,853 --> 00:36:55,009
Or at least some fucking
Palladone, for Christ sake,

541
00:36:55,009 --> 00:36:57,875
is this amateur architect doctor in here
you just saved some 100 people-

542
00:36:57,875 --> 00:36:59,979
Harling!

543
00:36:59,979 --> 00:37:01,456
You bring my smokes?

544
00:37:01,456 --> 00:37:04,990
Yes I did, I got your fucking message,
and yes I got your fucking smokes.

545
00:37:05,213 --> 00:37:07,889
Right here...
Here's a fresh carton.

546
00:37:08,189 --> 00:37:09,966
You smoke your nuts off, champion.

547
00:37:09,966 --> 00:37:12,599
Hell if I was you, I'd fire a brat
here in this goddamn room.

548
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:15,753
Here. I got you a pint of vodka,
I got you some Red Bull,

549
00:37:15,753 --> 00:37:17,498
you know what I'm saying,
I know my customer.

550
00:37:17,498 --> 00:37:18,680
Take the vodka with you.

551
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,428
What? Take the vodka,
what d'you-

552
00:37:20,428 --> 00:37:22,092
I'm not drinking anymore,
take it with you.

553
00:37:22,092 --> 00:37:23,199
Are you ins... I'll just tuck-

554
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,231
– Take the fucking vodka with you.

555
00:37:24,231 --> 00:37:25,112
– Take the fucking vodka with you.
– Okay.

556
00:37:25,512 --> 00:37:27,955
Listen mate, you got to
come to get me tomorrow.

557
00:37:27,955 --> 00:37:29,210
Okay?

558
00:37:31,963 --> 00:37:34,516
I want you to go by my condo...

559
00:37:35,017 --> 00:37:38,819
pick me up some clothes,
and uh, my phone charger.

560
00:37:38,819 --> 00:37:42,949
Look in my refridgerator, and pick up
a package that says "veal" on it.

561
00:37:42,949 --> 00:37:44,324
– It's marked. Veal.

562
00:37:44,324 --> 00:37:44,947
– It's marked. Veal.
– Veal.

563
00:37:44,947 --> 00:37:46,395
In the freezer's, marked veal.

564
00:37:46,395 --> 00:37:48,212
Done and done.
What time you want me here?

565
00:37:48,212 --> 00:37:49,931
– I call you.
– Okay. You give me mayday,

566
00:37:49,931 --> 00:37:52,000
and you’re outta here in 7 minutes.
Oh!

567
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:54,949
Oh, almost forgot,
I got you some stroke mags,

568
00:37:54,949 --> 00:37:57,064
I've been in a hospital before,
I know what you need,

569
00:37:57,064 --> 00:37:59,814
I got Juggs, Hot MILFS in heat,
Assmasters,

570
00:37:59,814 --> 00:38:01,985
you just stroke it all day,
you're a hero.

571
00:38:01,985 --> 00:38:06,193
If I was here, I'd just lay here
pullin'on that thing all day long,

572
00:38:06,193 --> 00:38:10,014
you know what I'm saying,
there's a smile... yessir.

573
00:39:11,528 --> 00:39:14,162
Devious minds think alike.

574
00:39:15,734 --> 00:39:17,512
Don't go.

575
00:39:18,929 --> 00:39:21,019
I'll be quiet, it is...

576
00:39:21,764 --> 00:39:26,232
nice to... just sit and
smoke with somebody.

577
00:39:32,434 --> 00:39:34,329
Were you on that plane?

578
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:36,545
Yeah, why?

579
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:38,135
You?

580
00:39:39,368 --> 00:39:41,633
You must have been sittin' at the back.

581
00:39:44,543 --> 00:39:46,789
Yeah... by the back.

582
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,360
<i>Tobacco's but an Indian weed,</i>

583
00:39:49,602 --> 00:39:51,750
<i>Grows green in the morn, cut down at eve</i>

584
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:54,598
<i>It shows our decay, we are but clay.</i>

585
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:58,925
Ah, I love the smell
of nicotine in the mornin'!

586
00:40:00,392 --> 00:40:01,983
It smells like victory!

587
00:40:02,968 --> 00:40:04,788
Can't buy more.

588
00:40:08,449 --> 00:40:10,293
I should quit.

589
00:40:10,897 --> 00:40:13,797
My cancer might get cancer.

590
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:19,327
In the plane crash?

591
00:40:19,327 --> 00:40:20,652
You are...

592
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:25,689
Holy shit, man!
You're the fucking pilot!

593
00:40:26,722 --> 00:40:29,243
Huh, what happened out there?

594
00:40:30,117 --> 00:40:32,126
Okay.
Yeah, I-hmm...

595
00:40:32,355 --> 00:40:34,344
Tough deal, man, but you, uh...

596
00:40:34,685 --> 00:40:37,258
You walked away.
You limped away.

597
00:40:37,714 --> 00:40:41,094
Yeah, I'm lucky.
Goin’ home tomorrow.

598
00:40:41,094 --> 00:40:42,348
Home...

599
00:40:42,613 --> 00:40:44,228
Home for me is the basement...

600
00:40:44,228 --> 00:40:46,462
They keep cancer treatment
in the basement.

601
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,658
What kind of cancer you have?

602
00:40:48,658 --> 00:40:52,037
Fibro-mixzoid sarcoma.
Soft tissue sarcoma.

603
00:40:52,037 --> 00:40:54,427
Very rare. God chose me.

604
00:40:55,179 --> 00:40:57,219
You believe in Him?

605
00:40:57,753 --> 00:41:01,300
Fuck yeah bitch, you’re a stupid
fucker if you don’t believe in God.

606
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:04,008
Once you realize all the
random events in your life are God,

607
00:41:04,008 --> 00:41:06,531
you will live a much easier life.

608
00:41:06,925 --> 00:41:10,258
You spend all your time trying to control
all these things that happen to us.

609
00:41:10,258 --> 00:41:11,219
Bullshit.

610
00:41:11,574 --> 00:41:14,330
The plane you’re flying goes down?
Out of your control.

611
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:17,059
God gives you cancer.
I got no control over that.

612
00:41:17,441 --> 00:41:20,845
Did God give me cancer?
You bet your ass God gave me cancer.

613
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:23,922
You know, you think God would have
given me cancer if I had asked for it?

614
00:41:23,922 --> 00:41:27,810
Well I don't think so, cause I begged him
to take it away, and guess what?

615
00:41:29,166 --> 00:41:31,751
No control over that either.

616
00:41:32,854 --> 00:41:34,422
What are you doing here, honey?

617
00:41:34,633 --> 00:41:36,583
You're beautiful, you know that?

618
00:41:37,806 --> 00:41:39,821
Do I scare you?

619
00:41:40,888 --> 00:41:44,761
People either are drawn to me,
or they pretend that they can’t see me.

620
00:41:46,499 --> 00:41:47,619
It’s a trip...

621
00:41:47,619 --> 00:41:49,566
They think that because I'm
getting close to the other side,

622
00:41:49,566 --> 00:41:51,570
I got some sort of power or wisdom.

623
00:41:51,797 --> 00:41:53,351
Like I got all the answers.

624
00:41:53,351 --> 00:41:55,413
I don't know, maybe I do.

625
00:41:56,422 --> 00:41:58,575
Death gives you perspective.

626
00:41:58,575 --> 00:42:00,239
It all makes sense somehow.

627
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:03,113
And I just can’t get over
how beautiful you are!

628
00:42:04,621 --> 00:42:06,254
I can see your arm.

629
00:42:06,254 --> 00:42:07,950
You're an addict?

630
00:42:09,692 --> 00:42:10,425
Yeah.

631
00:42:11,416 --> 00:42:12,993
What's your name?

632
00:42:14,112 --> 00:42:15,620
Nicole.

633
00:42:16,485 --> 00:42:18,513
What d'you do in the world, Nicole?

634
00:42:18,834 --> 00:42:20,234
Not much.

635
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:23,634
I was a photographer and
then I was a masseuse,

636
00:42:23,634 --> 00:42:26,999
and now I... I sometimes
wash hair at a salon.

637
00:42:26,999 --> 00:42:28,874
Oh yeah? Where is it?

638
00:42:29,291 --> 00:42:32,984
I will come by, I’m really easy,
you just wash my head.

639
00:42:35,067 --> 00:42:37,045
You think you’re gonna die?

640
00:42:48,665 --> 00:42:50,354
Don’t you just love her?

641
00:42:51,303 --> 00:42:52,538
I don't know her.

642
00:42:52,538 --> 00:42:55,152
Bullshit. I do.

643
00:42:56,274 --> 00:42:58,169
Random Act of God?

644
00:42:58,396 --> 00:43:00,216
I don’t think so.

645
00:43:00,574 --> 00:43:04,529
You survive a plane crash and meet
a beautiful woman in a stairwell...

646
00:43:05,506 --> 00:43:07,833
Fuck you, man.

647
00:43:10,556 --> 00:43:12,301
Probably looking for me.

648
00:43:13,139 --> 00:43:14,683
My family just flew in from Utah.

649
00:43:14,683 --> 00:43:16,942
You know it’s bad when
they start flying in.

650
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:21,337
It is a trip.

651
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,157
With every morning special now.

652
00:43:24,642 --> 00:43:26,702
I am greateful for that.

653
00:43:26,907 --> 00:43:29,397
I wish I could bottle
this feelin' that I have...

654
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:32,877
about how beautiful
every last breath of life is.

655
00:43:37,216 --> 00:43:39,315
Yeah, I get one more just for the road?

656
00:43:39,315 --> 00:43:41,908
Here. Take the pack.

657
00:43:46,602 --> 00:43:47,844
Thank you.

658
00:43:47,844 --> 00:43:50,159
I’ll pass these out in the cancer ward.

659
00:43:51,262 --> 00:43:52,510
Nicole...

660
00:43:52,927 --> 00:43:54,143
you’re gonna be okay.

661
00:44:01,014 --> 00:44:03,023
Chemo brain...

662
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:06,128
It makes you pretty foggy.

663
00:44:06,128 --> 00:44:07,102
Oh, yeah?

664
00:44:07,334 --> 00:44:09,074
They call it chemo brain.

665
00:44:09,629 --> 00:44:12,974
My mom, she used to slur
her words and get all chatty.

666
00:44:14,002 --> 00:44:15,754
Your mom had cancer?

667
00:44:16,649 --> 00:44:19,064
Breast cancer, she was only 54.

668
00:44:20,485 --> 00:44:22,687
Is that why you think you gonna die?

669
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:28,583
Heroin addicts who're usin' needles,
they tend to die.

670
00:44:29,271 --> 00:44:33,132
Especially women for some reason,
I have read in a pamphlet.

671
00:44:34,591 --> 00:44:38,446
A woman from AA, she just came
to see me while I was in rea.

672
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:43,181
That guy was a trip, uh?

673
00:44:43,449 --> 00:44:44,376
– Yeah.

674
00:44:44,825 --> 00:44:47,272
He made it feel like, I dunno...

675
00:44:48,099 --> 00:44:51,885
like you and me were
the last people left on this planet.

676
00:44:53,292 --> 00:44:57,047
And together we'll... save the world.

677
00:45:09,265 --> 00:45:11,179
Where d'you live, Nicole?

678
00:45:11,179 --> 00:45:14,459
Why, you wanna come to visit me?
It's luxurious.

679
00:45:15,242 --> 00:45:17,501
I live in Bankhead, near the bus station.

680
00:45:18,004 --> 00:45:19,329
I'll come to visit you.

681
00:45:19,541 --> 00:45:20,452
You're sweet.

682
00:45:20,452 --> 00:45:21,855
I will.

683
00:45:22,589 --> 00:45:24,136
What’s your address?

684
00:45:25,651 --> 00:45:29,028
I live at the Georgian Terraces...
on Taylor street.

685
00:45:29,028 --> 00:45:30,175
Okay.

686
00:45:30,852 --> 00:45:34,059
You say you're a masseuse.
What kind of masseuse?

687
00:45:34,792 --> 00:45:37,804
I've been every kind of masseuse there is.

688
00:45:40,685 --> 00:45:42,339
Good luck, Nicole.

689
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:52,136
I couldn't find any suitcases.
I put all your shit in garbage bags.

690
00:45:52,136 --> 00:45:53,381
No, thanks.

691
00:45:56,309 --> 00:45:59,052
You’re stayin’ with me
down on University, right?

692
00:45:59,052 --> 00:46:03,927
Hey it’s nice... A lotta young people...
Good vibe.

693
00:46:04,992 --> 00:46:07,575
No, I’m gonna go to the farm.

694
00:46:08,384 --> 00:46:10,288
The farm?

695
00:46:10,592 --> 00:46:12,910
I can’t stay at my condo.

696
00:46:13,432 --> 00:46:15,429
I thought you sold your Dad's place.

697
00:46:15,429 --> 00:46:16,933
Not yet.

698
00:46:18,957 --> 00:46:21,256
I’m not sure I wanna stay at the farm.

699
00:46:21,462 --> 00:46:25,029
You’re not. You're gonna drive me
to the airport so I can pick-up my car.

700
00:46:26,359 --> 00:46:27,408
Veal?

701
00:46:27,909 --> 00:46:29,029
Really?

702
00:47:44,314 --> 00:47:48,536
<i>Captain Whitaker, this is Jim Court,

705
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:51,366

706
00:50:51,366 --> 00:50:53,729

713
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:19,362
<i>Look, I'm back in town and... I
stopped by at the hospital tonight,</i>

714
00:51:19,362 --> 00:51:23,721
<i>but, uh... they said you'd gone home,
so you must be feeling pretty good.</i>

715
00:51:24,251 --> 00:51:27,756
Uh... Listen, I went, uh... at your condo

716
00:51:27,756 --> 00:51:30,155
and the manager said
you had not returned, so...

717
00:51:30,433 --> 00:51:32,638
you maybe with relatives,
which I understand,

718
00:51:32,638 --> 00:51:35,756
but I know you have a doctor's appointment
early in the morning for your eye,

719
00:51:35,756 --> 00:51:38,770
and I was just hoping that
you could meet us for breakfast,

720
00:51:39,196 --> 00:51:42,686
'bout ten o'clock at St Regis,
there is an executive buffet there,

721
00:51:42,686 --> 00:51:46,230
And we'll be covering some
pretty important stuff, so...

722
00:51:46,638 --> 00:51:48,518
it'd be nice to have you there.

723
00:51:48,745 --> 00:51:50,703
Alright. Be good.

724
00:52:16,731 --> 00:52:20,042
Oh, there he is. Hey Whip,
hey buddy. Man, you loog good!

725
00:52:20,042 --> 00:52:21,814
I feel-Thanks for coming,
I'm glad you got my message.

726
00:52:21,814 --> 00:52:23,515
How is your eye?
– Good. Goog, good.

727
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:25,624
Here's Hugh Lang,
he's an attorney from Chicago.

728
00:52:25,624 --> 00:52:27,347
– Pleasure to meet you, Captain.
– My pleasure.

729
00:52:27,347 --> 00:52:29,638
– Sit down. You wanna coffee?
– Uh, yes I do.

730
00:52:29,638 --> 00:52:31,749
Could we have some fresh coffee?

731
00:52:32,048 --> 00:52:35,375
We were just talking about
your copilot’s wife.

732
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:38,150
She told a newspaper
that “God landed that plane”.

733
00:52:38,385 --> 00:52:40,755
Yeah? God?

734
00:52:40,963 --> 00:52:42,406
Well, I too believe God landed the plane,

735
00:52:42,406 --> 00:52:45,538
same way I believe God should hit the
buffet, the turkey sausage is excellent.

736
00:52:45,867 --> 00:52:47,981
No, I’m fine with coffee, thank you.

737
00:52:48,275 --> 00:52:50,550
So Len Caldwell really wanted
to get here this morning,

738
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:52,023
Len's the president of the pilots’ union,

739
00:52:52,023 --> 00:52:54,000
he wanted to be here to
meet with us, and you,

740
00:52:54,299 --> 00:52:56,415
but they needed him at the crash site.

741
00:52:56,415 --> 00:52:58,370
So as you know, when a plane goes down,

742
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:01,730
the NTSB sends a “go team”
to the crash site immediately.

743
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:03,442
They find the flight data recorders?

744
00:53:03,442 --> 00:53:07,099
– They did, it's perfectly intact.
- Oh, great, then that solves everything.

745
00:53:07,474 --> 00:53:10,731
So. Why do we need a lawyer from Chicago?

746
00:53:10,731 --> 00:53:14,449
Well... Hugh specializes
in criminal negligence.

747
00:53:14,449 --> 00:53:16,316
– Criminal negligence?
– Hmm-hmm.

748
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:18,505
Death demands responsibility.

749
00:53:18,505 --> 00:53:20,887
Six dead on that plane,
someone has to pay.

750
00:53:20,887 --> 00:53:23,274
Yeah, but that's a plane
that fell apart at...

751
00:53:23,274 --> 00:53:25,138
think it fell apart at 30 thousand feet.

752
00:53:25,339 --> 00:53:27,729
And the airline will try to
prove equipment failure.

753
00:53:27,729 --> 00:53:30,740
Which is gonna make the manufacturer
responsible, the manufacturer in turn

754
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:33,543
is gonna try and prove poor maintenance
of the equipment by the airline.

755
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:34,871
Or pilot error.

756
00:53:37,004 --> 00:53:39,966
I flew the plane inverted,
that means upside down, Hugh.

757
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:43,803
You get the picture? A hundred people
upside down, 500 feet off the ground.

758
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:45,707
You have any idea what that's like?

759
00:53:45,707 --> 00:53:48,691
I do. I, uh... heard the
black box recordings last night.

760
00:53:48,691 --> 00:53:50,645
Oh you heard. So you're a pilot?

761
00:53:50,856 --> 00:53:51,786
No, no.

762
00:53:51,786 --> 00:53:53,356
Then you know what the fuck
you're talking about, do you?

763
00:53:53,356 --> 00:53:54,486
Hugh's on our team, Whip.

764
00:53:54,486 --> 00:53:55,423
– Is he?
– Yeah, he is,

765
00:53:55,423 --> 00:53:56,530
– He didn' act like he gonna
– obviously...

766
00:53:56,530 --> 00:53:57,851
– have to imagine me questions
– well, he is, yeah but...

767
00:53:57,851 --> 00:53:59,101
– like a fucking pilot,
– Listen to me,

768
00:53:59,101 --> 00:54:00,374
– and that he knows something.
– it's the NTSB's ball game.

769
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:04,185
They run the investigation, and
they will ultimately rule on the cause.

770
00:54:04,185 --> 00:54:06,201
And that's why we need him.
– Well, they...

771
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:08,848
interview the entire flight
crew, they...

772
00:54:09,530 --> 00:54:12,512
interview the passengers,
they... hold public hearings.

773
00:54:12,898 --> 00:54:15,825
Hey, let's cut to the chase, what...
just tell me what I need to know, Charlie.

774
00:54:15,825 --> 00:54:21,185
The NTSB 'go-team' also collects
blood, hair, and skin samples

775
00:54:21,185 --> 00:54:25,250
from the entire flight crew for the
purposes of a toxicological report.

776
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:28,072
Okay... When do they want to do that?

777
00:54:28,072 --> 00:54:30,635
They've already done that.
In the hospital.

778
00:54:30,635 --> 00:54:32,927
That's the first thing they do.

779
00:54:33,888 --> 00:54:36,215
You don't remember having your
blood drawn the night of the crash?

780
00:54:36,215 --> 00:54:37,637
– No.
– No?

781
00:54:42,743 --> 00:54:45,201
They get the results of these...
these tests?

782
00:54:45,201 --> 00:54:46,782
Yeah, they do.

783
00:54:47,829 --> 00:54:49,256
Anything else for you, gentlemen?

784
00:54:49,256 --> 00:54:52,980
Yeah, uh... you have warm
cinnamon bums over there.

785
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:55,230
Could you give me one of those, please.
In fact give me only two bums.

786
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:56,651
– Yes sir, comin'up.
– Thank you, sweetie.

787
00:54:56,651 --> 00:54:57,959
Now...

788
00:54:58,315 --> 00:55:00,687
An initial report shows that...

789
00:55:00,687 --> 00:55:05,614
you had alcohol in your system...
uh, at a level of .2 4.

790
00:55:05,614 --> 00:55:07,784
Now...
in the good old U.S.,

791
00:55:07,784 --> 00:55:11,049
a very one of the most lenient
drunk driving countries in the world,

792
00:55:11,049 --> 00:55:14,738
you go to jail for driving
with anything above .0 8.

793
00:55:14,738 --> 00:55:17,646
And by driving, I mean a car.

794
00:55:18,355 --> 00:55:20,261
Thank you.
Well...

795
00:55:20,261 --> 00:55:22,807
so that was... don't mean anything,

796
00:55:22,807 --> 00:55:24,745
a couple of beers the
night before the flight,

797
00:55:24,745 --> 00:55:26,440
would that make the tail
of the plane explode?

798
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,852
– Couple of beers?
– Yeah, couple of beers.

799
00:55:29,085 --> 00:55:30,611
You know, I need a lawyer, Charlie.

800
00:55:30,611 --> 00:55:32,252
– Hugh is your lawyer.
– I need a bigger lawyer.

801
00:55:32,252 --> 00:55:34,948
I need a layer that understands that
someone put me on a broken plane,

802
00:55:34,948 --> 00:55:37,909
without me up there, there
would be a 102 funerals, not six.

803
00:55:37,909 --> 00:55:39,714
We're not talking about
funeral right now, Captain.

804
00:55:39,714 --> 00:55:40,251
– Well then, what are we talking about?

805
00:55:40,251 --> 00:55:41,906
– Well then, what are we talking about?
– We're talking about prison time.

806
00:55:42,767 --> 00:55:43,991
– What?
– Lawsuits.

807
00:55:45,088 --> 00:55:45,608
Somebody has to pay.

808
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:46,981
Somebody has to pay.
– What, I write a check?

809
00:55:46,981 --> 00:55:49,078
I'ts not gonna be me, I promise you that.

810
00:55:49,078 --> 00:55:51,624
As long as they're writing checks,
tell them they write one for me too.

811
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:55,649
Because someone put me in a broken plane.
I'd love a check, Charlie.

812
00:55:55,649 --> 00:55:58,716
This toxicology report states
that you were drunk.

813
00:55:58,716 --> 00:56:01,184
And high on cocaine.

814
00:56:01,184 --> 00:56:03,914
Felony's punishable by up
to 12 years in prison.

815
00:56:03,914 --> 00:56:07,238
And if it is proven that your intoxication
was the cause of the death

816
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:10,373
of four passengers, now we're gonna
look at four counts of manslaughter.

817
00:56:11,153 --> 00:56:13,464
That could be life in prison.

818
00:56:13,972 --> 00:56:17,206
Now can I please do my job your behalf...

819
00:56:18,161 --> 00:56:20,652
and kill this tox report?

820
00:56:25,055 --> 00:56:26,623
He's gonna get it done, Whip.

821
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:28,666
He'll get it done, it's what
his whole life's about,

822
00:56:28,666 --> 00:56:30,810
trust me, trust him.

823
00:56:32,927 --> 00:56:35,146
You don't have to worry,
you'll walk away from this-

824
00:56:35,146 --> 00:56:36,643
I am not worried, Charlie.

825
00:56:38,077 --> 00:56:40,197
I promise you that I'm not worried.

826
00:56:40,197 --> 00:56:43,457
No one could have landed
that plane like I did.

827
00:56:44,714 --> 00:56:46,241
No one.

828
00:56:52,574 --> 00:56:54,263
– Thanks for coming.
- Yeah.

829
00:56:54,263 --> 00:56:56,163
Excuse me.

830
00:56:57,844 --> 00:56:59,591
– Excuse me.
– Yeah?

831
00:56:59,591 --> 00:57:03,076
Yeah, let me have a...
orange juice, large orange juice.

832
00:57:03,437 --> 00:57:05,215
Just orange juice?

833
00:57:05,676 --> 00:57:07,075
Yeah, uh...

834
00:57:07,075 --> 00:57:08,856
No. Uh...

835
00:57:10,025 --> 00:57:11,350
Double Stoli.

836
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:12,948
Neat.

837
00:57:13,225 --> 00:57:17,323
<i>.. to me anyway, of a real American hero.
Is that your reading of it?</i>

838
00:57:17,323 --> 00:57:22,173
<i>Absolutely. However, remember
every situation is different.</i>

839
00:57:22,173 --> 00:57:25,442
<i>And the actions of the pilots
of SouthJet 2-2-7</i>

840
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,161
<i>will be heavily scrutinized.</i>

841
00:57:27,161 --> 00:57:30,508
<i>Are you suggesting that there may
be more to this that leans behind?</i>

842
00:57:30,508 --> 00:57:34,593
<i>They're all answers. We don't have all of
the answers, we have a lot of questions.</i>

843
00:57:34,593 --> 00:57:38,124
<i>We're gonna have to wait until
some of those answers come in before...</i>

844
00:58:23,323 --> 00:58:26,056
The next morning...

845
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:29,531
They're not gonna shot me...

846
00:58:30,708 --> 00:58:33,604
Aah, Taylor street.

847
00:59:22,754 --> 00:59:23,572
<i>Get out.</i>

848
00:59:23,572 --> 00:59:26,845
<i>The guy in Unit 1 just told me
you stayed here last night!</i>

849
00:59:29,431 --> 00:59:32,083
<i>What about my rent?
You owe me money, bitch.</i>

850
00:59:32,083 --> 00:59:34,043
– Don't touch me, Fran.
– Listen, I'm gonna...

851
00:59:34,043 --> 00:59:37,088
– Fuck, you will listen to me...
– Fran, get off me Frankie, you're...

852
00:59:37,712 --> 00:59:39,795
.. the fuck are you doin'?
Fuck off, man.

853
00:59:39,795 --> 00:59:42,410
Keep your fucking hands off her!

854
00:59:47,170 --> 00:59:49,178
Are you okay?

855
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:52,818
Sorry, is this... is this
all the rest of your stuff?

856
00:59:53,187 --> 00:59:54,117
Uh, yeah.

857
00:59:54,117 --> 00:59:56,133
She still owe me 1100 dollars.

858
00:59:56,133 --> 00:59:58,323
Plus damages...
– Get out!

859
01:00:00,257 --> 01:00:02,177
What, you wanna sue her?

860
01:00:02,177 --> 01:00:05,544
Spend a 1000 bucks, or you wanna make
a cash deal with me? Make up your mind.

861
01:00:06,327 --> 01:00:07,800
Make up your mind!

862
01:00:09,051 --> 01:00:11,478
I take 700 cash.

863
01:00:12,490 --> 01:00:14,597
You're a hairy little creep, aren't you?

864
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:17,100
Baseball bat bullshit.

865
01:00:21,358 --> 01:00:24,868
700 my ass. Here's 400 cash.

866
01:00:24,868 --> 01:00:27,040
Now be a good boy.

867
01:00:27,269 --> 01:00:29,907
Grab that box, put it in her car.

868
01:00:29,907 --> 01:00:32,343
Uh... but my car don’t run.

869
01:00:32,343 --> 01:00:35,296
It didn't start this morning,
I'm taking all this with me.

870
01:00:35,701 --> 01:00:37,503
– Your car doesn't run?
– Hmm-hmm.

871
01:00:38,596 --> 01:00:40,593
Well, what you're gonna do?

872
01:00:41,352 --> 01:00:42,752
Well I...

873
01:00:43,968 --> 01:00:46,420
I don't know what I was gonna do.

874
01:01:12,527 --> 01:01:14,351
What's your name?

875
01:01:14,804 --> 01:01:15,983
Whip.

876
01:01:20,671 --> 01:01:22,465
What?

877
01:01:23,415 --> 01:01:25,608
That's funny?

878
01:01:31,659 --> 01:01:32,967
Thank you.

879
01:01:34,101 --> 01:01:35,680
Captain Whip.

880
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:52,577
You Okay?

881
01:01:52,882 --> 01:01:54,997
– Yeah. And you?
– Yeah.

882
01:01:55,243 --> 01:01:57,688
– You wan' a drink?
– No, thanks.

883
01:02:00,248 --> 01:02:02,753
Sure it's alright that I stay here?

884
01:02:02,753 --> 01:02:05,844
– Yes, it's alright that you stay here.

885
01:02:06,189 --> 01:02:08,366
I want you to stay.

886
01:02:10,642 --> 01:02:12,296
That knee hurtin' you?

887
01:02:13,046 --> 01:02:15,700
Yes is it.
Yes, sweetie.

888
01:02:22,521 --> 01:02:24,834
Thank you, Doctor.

889
01:02:26,925 --> 01:02:29,491
– It’s throbbing within...
– Yeah.

890
01:02:29,491 --> 01:02:33,069
Cos it's having a hard time
getting back to your heart.

891
01:02:41,764 --> 01:02:43,964
That's good though.

892
01:04:00,849 --> 01:04:03,177
You gonna shoot me?

893
01:04:03,177 --> 01:04:05,596
Or can I come inside?

894
01:04:05,596 --> 01:04:08,603
Yeah, come on inside, I shoot you inside.

895
01:04:11,370 --> 01:04:15,477
Listen, I... I thought we'd take a ride,
there's some I need to show you.

896
01:04:17,673 --> 01:04:19,073
I'm good.

897
01:04:24,771 --> 01:04:26,768
There it is.

898
01:04:28,063 --> 01:04:32,678
You can see... on initial impact,
the left wing hit the ground.

899
01:04:33,178 --> 01:04:34,880
I think if it would have
sheared off completely,

900
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:36,617
everybody would have walked
away from this plane.

901
01:04:37,379 --> 01:04:39,854
Wing snapped off and it jaw opened the...

902
01:04:40,419 --> 01:04:44,362
engine cowling into the... rear fuselage.

903
01:04:44,362 --> 01:04:45,521
Yeah.

904
01:04:45,521 --> 01:04:48,440
If you were sitting in the last
six or seven rows it was...

905
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:50,229
like being hit by a train.

906
01:04:51,546 --> 01:04:52,599
Who are they?

907
01:04:52,599 --> 01:04:55,517
The John the Baptist Pentecoastal Mission.

908
01:04:55,517 --> 01:04:57,628
They helped pull survivors
out of the wreckage.

909
01:04:57,628 --> 01:04:59,982
Now they come out here every day.

910
01:05:08,612 --> 01:05:11,831
And that is Ellen Block.

911
01:05:12,353 --> 01:05:14,162
She is the head of the NTSB investigation.

912
01:05:14,162 --> 01:05:17,197
She's the one that's gonna be
asking you the tough questions.

913
01:05:17,721 --> 01:05:20,461
I night the night before the flight.
I drank that morning too,

914
01:05:20,461 --> 01:05:22,924
I used cocaine to help
straighten myself up.

915
01:05:23,775 --> 01:05:26,336
I know.
It's in the toxicology report.

916
01:05:26,336 --> 01:05:29,083
And it's not the reason why this happened.

917
01:05:29,639 --> 01:05:31,319
No, it's not.

918
01:05:32,473 --> 01:05:33,593
Listen.

919
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:37,430
Clearly there was a mechanical
issue with the plane.

920
01:05:37,430 --> 01:05:39,834
– Clearly.
– Yeah. But what you and I know...

921
01:05:40,615 --> 01:05:42,911
This was an "Act of God".

922
01:05:44,054 --> 01:05:47,024
And I'm gonna fight to get
the NTSB to add "Act of God"

923
01:05:47,024 --> 01:05:49,903
as one of the probable causes.

924
01:05:49,903 --> 01:05:52,706
Who’s God would do this?

925
01:06:03,888 --> 01:06:07,838
Here’s the deal. Avington Carr,
is the owner of the airline,

926
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:11,534
He's on our side.
He's got big friends in Washington too.

927
01:06:12,357 --> 01:06:15,286
He wants to have a sit down with us
tomorrow morning at ten o'clock.

928
01:06:15,964 --> 01:06:17,784
– Really?
– Yeah.

929
01:06:18,389 --> 01:06:20,356
You can't drink, Captain.

930
01:06:21,947 --> 01:06:25,400
You're under the microscope right now.
You can't be seen buy a liquor.

931
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:28,234
That means no bars... no drugs.

932
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:30,516
– I understand. I won't drink,
I promise you.

933
01:06:31,227 --> 01:06:32,951
– Look, we can get you help...
– I don't need help-

934
01:06:32,951 --> 01:06:34,802
I won't drink, I promise you.

935
01:06:34,802 --> 01:06:37,701
I can stop. On my own.

936
01:06:38,262 --> 01:06:40,082
– Okay.
– Okay.

937
01:06:44,211 --> 01:06:46,374
– So ten O'clock-
– Ten O'clock, I got it.

938
01:06:46,374 --> 01:06:48,245
Avington Car.

939
01:06:48,746 --> 01:06:51,251
I never wanted that fucking airline.

940
01:06:51,251 --> 01:06:54,441
Neither did my brother.
It was my father that wanted it.

941
01:06:54,441 --> 01:06:55,929
I like baseball.

942
01:06:55,929 --> 01:06:57,249
– Oh, I like baseball.
– Everyone likes to watch baseball.

943
01:06:57,249 --> 01:06:58,927
Everybody enjoys to like baseball.

944
01:06:58,927 --> 01:07:00,238
– The whole country likes baseball.

945
01:07:00,238 --> 01:07:01,511
– The whole country likes baseball.
– Cut the crap.

946
01:07:02,716 --> 01:07:05,229
So... what's the deal, Lenny?

947
01:07:05,229 --> 01:07:07,831
Is your union gonna survive this one?

948
01:07:08,127 --> 01:07:11,499
More importantly, how big a check
you think I’m gonna have to write?

949
01:07:11,499 --> 01:07:14,071
Well, you had six fatalities
on board your aircraft.

950
01:07:14,071 --> 01:07:16,928
No no, it's four, Lenny.
The two crew members don't count.

951
01:07:19,534 --> 01:07:20,859
I don't mean they don't count.

952
01:07:20,859 --> 01:07:23,022
They don't get settlements
like the passengers.

953
01:07:23,022 --> 01:07:26,202
Yeah, that’s a workman’s comp claim,
part of the union contract.

954
01:07:26,645 --> 01:07:29,722
They do dangerous job, they know it.

955
01:07:30,276 --> 01:07:32,281
You’re the lawyer for the pilots’ union?

956
01:07:32,281 --> 01:07:35,654
No sir, this is Hugh Lang, he's
the attorney we brought on

957
01:07:35,654 --> 01:07:38,238
to handle the criminal side of
Captain Whitaker’s situation.

958
01:07:40,220 --> 01:07:43,119
Yes, and what is Mr. Whitaker's situation?

959
01:07:43,511 --> 01:07:47,469
NTSB is up my ass with a flashlight,
we had to give them access to everything.

960
01:07:47,772 --> 01:07:49,820
Everbody's curious about Captain Whitaker.

961
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:53,032
Well I flew with him in the Navy
and he is a great pilot.

962
01:07:53,259 --> 01:07:54,379
Huh.

963
01:07:55,621 --> 01:07:57,017
Is he a drunk?

964
01:08:01,046 --> 01:08:03,708
He's a heavy drinker.
But maybe I should bring in him?

965
01:08:03,708 --> 01:08:05,132
In a minute.

966
01:08:05,785 --> 01:08:08,224
Alright, so let’s get down to it, Lenny.

967
01:08:08,652 --> 01:08:12,384
What does the union plan to do
about this blood test saying

968
01:08:12,621 --> 01:08:15,243
Whitaker was high on booze and coke?

969
01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:17,032
This guy’s a real peach.

970
01:08:17,248 --> 01:08:19,425
I'm gonna kill the toxicology report.

971
01:08:20,489 --> 01:08:23,391
The testing was done incompetently.

972
01:08:23,391 --> 01:08:28,472
The toxicology equipment they used
was last calibrated in June of 2009.

973
01:08:28,472 --> 01:08:31,202
It's already 18 months past code.

974
01:08:31,476 --> 01:08:35,599
Their log that should clearly state
who labeled the blood vials and when,

975
01:08:35,599 --> 01:08:39,559
is very incomplete, and they used a
preservative in the blood

976
01:08:39,559 --> 01:08:42,371
that has been known to cause fermentation,

977
01:08:42,611 --> 01:08:45,689
and in some cases register
higher in an alcohol test.

978
01:08:45,689 --> 01:08:49,332
Now, I have done all this, I've
only been here a few days. So...

979
01:08:49,332 --> 01:08:51,606
I wouldn't worry about it too much,
I can handle this.

980
01:08:52,103 --> 01:08:53,525
I like this guy, Lenny.

981
01:08:53,736 --> 01:08:56,720
Makes me wanna go out
sniff a few lines and fly a jet.

982
01:08:57,112 --> 01:08:58,228
Mr. Carr,

983
01:08:58,228 --> 01:09:02,203
we’re gonna fight to push all the fault
on the manufacturer, Jackson Ridgefield.

984
01:09:02,203 --> 01:09:05,815
And you think they’re gonna just open
their check book and buy us all lunch?

985
01:09:06,159 --> 01:09:07,845
Good fucking luck.

986
01:09:08,538 --> 01:09:10,008
What’s my exposure Jim?

987
01:09:11,384 --> 01:09:14,077
Well, the awards to the
families could kill the airline.

988
01:09:14,077 --> 01:09:15,237
Fuck the airline.

989
01:09:15,237 --> 01:09:17,359
The insurance companies
can have the goddamm airline.

990
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:19,593
I just don’t want them come
sniffing in my other pockets.

991
01:09:19,593 --> 01:09:23,857
Speaking for the pilots’ union, sir,
we don’t want to see your airline go away.

992
01:09:23,857 --> 01:09:25,765
We enjoy the contract you have with us.

993
01:09:26,110 --> 01:09:29,498
We gonna protect Captain Whitaker,
and in turn we gonna protect your airline.

994
01:09:30,520 --> 01:09:34,133
Does... Whitaker know he's goin' to jail?

995
01:09:34,803 --> 01:09:36,873
My client isn't goin' to jail, Mr. Carr.

996
01:09:36,873 --> 01:09:39,712
Oh, he's goin' to jail.
He belongs in jail.

997
01:09:39,712 --> 01:09:42,562
Bet your ass he's goin' to jail,
the only question is...

998
01:09:42,562 --> 01:09:44,652
is he gonna die in jail?

999
01:09:44,652 --> 01:09:46,686
You are wrong, Mr. Carr.

1000
01:09:47,049 --> 01:09:50,271
Last time I checked, six counts
of manslaughter, it's life in prison.

1001
01:09:50,999 --> 01:09:52,590
Life in prison...

1002
01:09:53,028 --> 01:09:56,246
What we in Georgia call “all day long”.

1003
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:06,412
I hear you're some kind o' pilot.

1004
01:10:33,164 --> 01:10:36,021
Theeere she is, there she is.

1005
01:10:36,021 --> 01:10:40,083
Back to the meet?
Had a nice meeting?

1006
01:10:43,097 --> 01:10:45,483
I know, it's okay, uh?

1007
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:50,487
It's okay...

1008
01:10:51,254 --> 01:10:53,136
Yup, that's it.

1009
01:10:59,593 --> 01:11:00,713
Me?

1010
01:11:02,757 --> 01:11:04,157
That's it.

1011
01:11:05,278 --> 01:11:07,676
Am I-No.
Yeah, no.

1012
01:11:17,556 --> 01:11:20,475
<i>You wanna run the boy, you wanna be
a quarterback, let me see you run it back!</i>

1013
01:11:20,749 --> 01:11:23,280
<i>So say "Dowdow", say "Kwakwa"!</i>

1014
01:12:53,886 --> 01:12:56,348
– Good morning.
– Hello.

1015
01:13:01,378 --> 01:13:03,633
You were in really
bad shape last night.

1016
01:13:03,633 --> 01:13:06,836
Yeah, true...
just tired.

1017
01:13:09,555 --> 01:13:12,216
Drank a little bit too much.

1018
01:13:12,436 --> 01:13:13,556
A bit?

1019
01:13:15,144 --> 01:13:17,837
What, you won't count the fucking beers?

1020
01:13:17,837 --> 01:13:19,514
I threw ‘em out.

1021
01:13:20,616 --> 01:13:22,441
They're in the garbage, vodka too.

1022
01:13:24,421 --> 01:13:26,000
Is that okay with you?

1023
01:13:26,244 --> 01:13:27,464
More than okay.

1024
01:13:32,448 --> 01:13:35,321
I’ve been watching the sky
change as the sun rises.

1025
01:13:37,419 --> 01:13:39,002
Beautiful.

1026
01:13:39,869 --> 01:13:42,782
I went out there, I took some great shots.

1027
01:13:47,545 --> 01:13:50,299
It's just so beautiful here.

1028
01:13:51,113 --> 01:13:52,744
You grew up here?

1029
01:13:52,978 --> 01:13:55,093
No, Dad did.

1030
01:13:58,108 --> 01:14:00,277
It's my grandfather's farm.

1031
01:14:03,147 --> 01:14:04,176
Was.

1032
01:14:05,965 --> 01:14:10,455
Dad was a pilot, he was a...
332nd airbone. He was a...

1033
01:14:10,705 --> 01:14:13,353
Tuskee, he built that
landing strip out there.

1034
01:14:15,038 --> 01:14:20,098
Crop dustin'. EPA shut him down, he...
traded the crop duster for...

1035
01:14:20,836 --> 01:14:24,201
that old Cesna sittin'
out there in the barn.

1036
01:14:26,352 --> 01:14:30,013
He flew that damn thing
all over the place.

1037
01:14:32,695 --> 01:14:36,310
He died... I got divorced, and...

1038
01:14:39,027 --> 01:14:41,540
been trying to sell the place ever since.

1039
01:14:43,927 --> 01:14:45,698
What about your mom?

1040
01:14:46,207 --> 01:14:47,534
Dead.

1041
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:51,767
You? What about your Dad?

1042
01:14:52,546 --> 01:14:55,348
Well, I'm pretty sure he...
lives in Colorado.

1043
01:14:55,348 --> 01:14:56,617
Yeah?

1044
01:14:57,885 --> 01:14:59,359
No relationship?

1045
01:15:00,232 --> 01:15:02,343
It was my mom that raised me.

1046
01:15:02,343 --> 01:15:03,871
She was incredible.

1047
01:15:05,344 --> 01:15:08,998
She held it together for so long,
I couldn’t tell how sick she was.

1048
01:15:11,629 --> 01:15:14,971
We spent those last seven months
together like we were teenagers.

1049
01:15:17,316 --> 01:15:21,459
We traded stories about
boys and... whatever.

1050
01:15:24,752 --> 01:15:26,633
Oh, she loved me.

1051
01:15:44,050 --> 01:15:45,696
My name's Trevor.

1052
01:15:46,188 --> 01:15:48,510
You saved my mom.

1053
01:16:00,631 --> 01:16:02,100
– It's great to see you, Whip.

1054
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:03,972
– It's great to see you, Whip.
– It's good to see you too.

1055
01:16:10,098 --> 01:16:11,838
The service was so nice.

1056
01:16:11,838 --> 01:16:14,644
I mean, all those people
who wanted to say goodbye.

1057
01:16:16,685 --> 01:16:19,870
And Trina looked so beautiful in there.
Don't you think you?

1058
01:16:20,567 --> 01:16:24,213
I mean, like she was gonna...
wake up and smile!

1059
01:16:24,517 --> 01:16:27,905
I didn’t go in, Margaret.
I... I just couldn’t.

1060
01:16:29,328 --> 01:16:30,419
Trevor...

1061
01:16:31,122 --> 01:16:34,325
Find daddy, baby.
He's over there with Mr. Benton.

1062
01:16:41,381 --> 01:16:43,659
You really should come
to the counseling group.

1063
01:16:43,659 --> 01:16:45,963
The Union has great
people for us to talk to.

1064
01:16:45,963 --> 01:16:48,322
I can't.
Really I...

1065
01:16:49,354 --> 01:16:50,474
I will.

1066
01:16:53,874 --> 01:16:55,905
– Yeah. Well...
– Margaret.

1067
01:16:57,695 --> 01:16:58,797
– You take care, okay, Whip?

1068
01:16:58,797 --> 01:16:59,669
– You take care, okay, Whip?
– Okay.

1069
01:17:00,325 --> 01:17:02,513
Listen, Margaret, I have a...

1070
01:17:04,424 --> 01:17:06,776
You know, I'm in
the middle of this, uh...

1071
01:17:07,799 --> 01:17:11,352
investigation. The NTSB
is investigating the crash.

1072
01:17:11,352 --> 01:17:13,032
Yeah, I'm gonna talk to ‘em next week.

1073
01:17:13,032 --> 01:17:16,836
Yeah. Well, I-I-
I'm a little nervous because...

1074
01:17:18,043 --> 01:17:21,793
I was out the night
before the crash, the diner-

1075
01:17:21,793 --> 01:17:22,760
Yeah. With Katerina.

1076
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:27,357
Right. And I had two glasses of wine,
and they're probably gonna ask you

1077
01:17:27,357 --> 01:17:30,018
about my condition that morning, or

1078
01:17:30,018 --> 01:17:32,819
whether you thought
I had anything to drink.

1079
01:17:36,365 --> 01:17:37,812
What?

1080
01:17:40,949 --> 01:17:42,892
I've known you eleven years, Whip.

1081
01:17:42,892 --> 01:17:43,833
Right.

1082
01:17:44,115 --> 01:17:48,547
You want to tell me that you and Trina went
to diner and you had two glasses of wine,

1083
01:17:48,547 --> 01:17:50,600
sounds like a nice restaurant,
now which one was it?

1084
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:53,534
You have to say that it was
an ordinary day, Margaret.

1085
01:17:53,534 --> 01:17:57,104
I mean, it was an ordinary day.
You know me, I was in shape to fly.

1086
01:18:02,007 --> 01:18:04,114
You have a problem saying that?

1087
01:18:05,851 --> 01:18:08,638
It's a lie, Whip... It's a lie.

1088
01:18:08,638 --> 01:18:11,282
Trina told me you two
hadn't been to sleep.

1089
01:18:11,282 --> 01:18:13,874
Well, the... my lack of
sleep had nothing to do

1090
01:18:13,874 --> 01:18:16,007
with that plane falling apart, Margaret.

1091
01:18:16,403 --> 01:18:18,875
I'm just trying to get these things
straight, now you think any other pilot

1092
01:18:18,875 --> 01:18:20,830
could have landed that plane
and saved more lives?

1093
01:18:20,830 --> 01:18:21,765
I didn't say that, Whip,

1094
01:18:21,765 --> 01:18:22,901
– Alright, then...
– I can't imagine another pilot...

1095
01:18:22,901 --> 01:18:27,287
Imagine your son Trevor in this
church looking at you in that box,

1096
01:18:27,287 --> 01:18:30,575
or my son visiting me in prison,
and for the next forty years-

1097
01:18:30,575 --> 01:18:32,873
Please, Whip, enough.
Enough, Whip.

1098
01:18:32,873 --> 01:18:35,082
Don't you think we've all had enough?

1099
01:18:42,887 --> 01:18:44,650
I need this, Margaret.

1100
01:18:52,167 --> 01:18:54,126
What d'you want me to say?

1101
01:18:56,070 --> 01:18:57,497
I just...

1102
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:00,748
It was an ordinary day.

1103
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:06,934
The storm... after we took off...

1104
01:19:07,245 --> 01:19:09,238
was very severe.

1105
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:13,497
But as far as the flight crew
is concerned, it was a...

1106
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:16,520
a perfectly ordinary day.

1107
01:19:42,974 --> 01:19:44,323
You okay?

1108
01:19:44,323 --> 01:19:46,042
Uh yeah, yeah.

1109
01:19:46,841 --> 01:19:47,591
So?

1110
01:19:48,456 --> 01:19:51,156
Well, I got through the first day,
they didn-t fire me,

1111
01:19:51,156 --> 01:19:52,619
so...
– Then?

1112
01:19:52,839 --> 01:19:55,774
And they need someone to work
the night shift, and they asked me,

1113
01:19:55,774 --> 01:19:57,954
it’s time and a half so...

1114
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:01,370
I got a vest...

1115
01:20:02,183 --> 01:20:04,417
and a... well, name tag,
I got you something.

1116
01:20:04,417 --> 01:20:06,337
– Yeah?
– Yeah.

1117
01:20:06,337 --> 01:20:07,831
Thank you.

1118
01:20:10,583 --> 01:20:11,566
– It is a P-51 mustang.

1119
01:20:11,566 --> 01:20:13,003
– It is a P-51 mustang.
– I know it's a P-51.

1120
01:20:13,003 --> 01:20:13,731
– Your daddy fly one of these?

1121
01:20:13,731 --> 01:20:14,744
– Your daddy fly one of these?
– Yes, he did.

1122
01:20:16,132 --> 01:20:18,075
It cause for celebration.

1123
01:20:18,075 --> 01:20:21,317
Oh well, I promised Sheila that
I'd go to this AA meeting now.

1124
01:20:21,761 --> 01:20:23,584
She's my sponsor, the one
that's been helping me,

1125
01:20:23,584 --> 01:20:25,014
can we celebrate tomorrow night?

1126
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,099
Yeah.

1127
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:29,685
Yeah sure, why not?

1128
01:20:33,496 --> 01:20:36,450
You know, you can come with me...
to the meeting.

1129
01:20:36,691 --> 01:20:39,323
It's an open meeting,
meaning that anyone can come.

1130
01:20:40,225 --> 01:20:41,266
Even you!

1131
01:20:43,075 --> 01:20:45,432
So the cops got a flashlight on
me behind the dumpster, I'm...

1132
01:20:45,432 --> 01:20:47,150
I'm wearing nothing but
my girlfriend’s panties,

1133
01:20:47,150 --> 01:20:49,224
I got vomitin' on the
front of my chest,

1134
01:20:50,076 --> 01:20:53,857
and I say to him:
"Uh... I might have had two beers."

1135
01:21:00,918 --> 01:21:03,437
So that's why I get the nickname:
"Two-Beer Barry".

1136
01:21:06,324 --> 01:21:08,993
I'm getting the, uh... the
stink eye from Ed over here,

1137
01:21:08,993 --> 01:21:10,595
have I gone off format?

1138
01:21:11,893 --> 01:21:14,218
My name is Barry and I'm an alcoholic.

1139
01:21:14,218 --> 01:21:15,625
Hi Barry.

1140
01:21:15,625 --> 01:21:18,767
Are there any other alcoholics present?

1141
01:21:24,077 --> 01:21:27,167
I always love a meeting where
we all have to identify the tab,

1142
01:21:27,167 --> 01:21:30,665
because it forces me to be
honest about who I really am.

1143
01:21:32,302 --> 01:21:36,855
And I never told the truth out there,
obviously I lied about everything.

1144
01:21:38,356 --> 01:21:41,395
I was told in these rooms that
I was never sober if I kept lying,

1145
01:21:41,395 --> 01:21:43,148
but that's what I was best at.

1146
01:21:45,855 --> 01:21:48,142
If I knew anything in this
world, it was how to lie,

1147
01:21:48,142 --> 01:21:51,468
especially about my drinking.
But...

1148
01:21:51,678 --> 01:21:54,901
whatever, I would lie about
the name of my dog,

1149
01:21:54,901 --> 01:21:58,165
I'd lie about the color of my
own hair right to your face.

1150
01:21:59,841 --> 01:22:05,065
My whole life just became... a series
of lies, strung together by me,

1151
01:22:05,065 --> 01:22:06,466
I gotta go.

1152
01:22:06,872 --> 01:22:07,992
Sure.

1153
01:22:08,465 --> 01:22:11,103
Oh yeah, Sheila, she can
give me a ride, does she?

1154
01:22:11,782 --> 01:22:12,902
I'm Sheila.

1155
01:22:33,185 --> 01:22:36,878
<i>I’ve been speaking to some people who
are very close to the NTSB investigation,</i>

1156
01:22:36,878 --> 01:22:40,167
<i>and they are confident they will
soon be able to determine exactly</i>

1157
01:22:40,167 --> 01:22:41,768
<i>what brought this plane down.</i>

1158
01:22:41,768 --> 01:22:44,344
<i>I'm sure they will, sir.</i>

1159
01:22:44,344 --> 01:22:47,365
<i>Well, Ken and Vicki Evans,
thank you very much.</i>

1160
01:22:47,365 --> 01:22:50,262
<i>Thank you sir. God bless you.</i>

1161
01:23:02,564 --> 01:23:04,820
How you feeling, Ken?

1162
01:23:06,583 --> 01:23:08,292
I'm happy to be alive.

1163
01:23:08,292 --> 01:23:10,564
Blessed... to be alive.

1164
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:15,850
I'm Captain Whitaker, I was...
flying the-

1165
01:23:15,850 --> 01:23:17,247
I know who you are.

1166
01:23:18,696 --> 01:23:22,006
Excuse me. Can you give us
some privacy, please?

1167
01:23:22,006 --> 01:23:23,590
Thank you.

1168
01:23:35,007 --> 01:23:37,114
So, uh...

1169
01:23:37,372 --> 01:23:39,192
How long have you been out of the...

1170
01:23:39,555 --> 01:23:41,395
– Out of the coma?
– Yeah.

1171
01:23:42,212 --> 01:23:43,607
Two days.

1172
01:23:48,355 --> 01:23:51,977
Well, uh, look, I don't wanna...
disrupt your whole day,

1173
01:23:52,908 --> 01:23:57,749
God knows you've been...
swamped by interviews, and...

1174
01:23:59,304 --> 01:24:02,239
You looked brillant on the CNN,
by the way.

1175
01:24:02,809 --> 01:24:06,472
Both my legs are crushed.
My pelvis is snapped.

1176
01:24:07,372 --> 01:24:11,875
I'll probably never walk again.
Al least not without a walker or braces.

1177
01:24:12,961 --> 01:24:15,162
I'll certainly never fly again.

1178
01:24:16,371 --> 01:24:17,967
I'm very sorry, Ken.

1179
01:24:18,693 --> 01:24:21,925
That plane was doomed
the moment you sat in that cockpit.

1180
01:24:22,677 --> 01:24:25,719
You reeked like gin or somethin’.

1181
01:24:26,144 --> 01:24:28,944
I called Vicki from the plane
before we took off.

1182
01:24:30,361 --> 01:24:32,873
That’s when the rain kicked up.

1183
01:24:34,247 --> 01:24:38,299
Well, I don’t know how much
you remember, but...

1184
01:24:38,923 --> 01:24:40,491
that plane...

1185
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:42,796
it started falling apart, Ken.

1186
01:24:42,796 --> 01:24:45,639
I remember everything until the crash.

1187
01:24:45,924 --> 01:24:47,529
I know what went wrong.

1188
01:24:49,904 --> 01:24:52,917
What are you trying to say, Ken?
What do we talk?

1189
01:24:53,852 --> 01:24:57,099
I do not know, Captain Whitaker.
What are we talking about?

1190
01:24:57,099 --> 01:25:00,372
I'm just trying to get a sense from you...

1191
01:25:01,373 --> 01:25:05,175
about what you thought caused the crash.

1192
01:25:06,474 --> 01:25:10,471
Was it the fact that you got on the
plane still drunk from the night before?

1193
01:25:12,319 --> 01:25:16,348
The NTSB is coming back tomorrow
to finish taking a deposition from me...

1194
01:25:17,554 --> 01:25:19,403
about the events on that flight.

1195
01:25:19,835 --> 01:25:23,973
Do you think you... be alive
if I wasn't flying that plane?

1196
01:25:25,233 --> 01:25:26,238
No.

1197
01:25:27,266 --> 01:25:28,923
We'd all be dead.

1198
01:25:29,688 --> 01:25:33,545
But you gonna argue with me
that your physical state was tip-top?

1199
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:40,350
Wait.

1200
01:25:40,999 --> 01:25:42,184
Sit...

1201
01:25:42,957 --> 01:25:44,271
Please.

1202
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:52,856
I never shared my opinion
about your physical state...

1203
01:25:53,263 --> 01:25:55,090
the morning of the flight.

1204
01:25:56,097 --> 01:25:57,524
I never said a word.

1205
01:26:00,057 --> 01:26:02,274
That crash was pre-ordained.

1206
01:26:03,679 --> 01:26:05,559
I prayed on it, Captain.

1207
01:26:05,559 --> 01:26:07,786
Vicky and I both prayed on it.

1208
01:26:08,626 --> 01:26:10,090
There's only one judge, sir.

1209
01:26:10,090 --> 01:26:11,543
Praise Jesus!

1210
01:26:11,755 --> 01:26:13,862
And he's got a higher plan for you.

1211
01:26:14,949 --> 01:26:19,143
This event... although it's
tragic in his loss of life...

1212
01:26:21,127 --> 01:26:23,430
it's also a celebration of life.

1213
01:26:24,441 --> 01:26:27,321
Nothing happens in the kingdom
of the Lord by mistake, sir.

1214
01:26:27,321 --> 01:26:28,937
Praise Jesus!

1215
01:26:28,937 --> 01:26:30,342
Captain...

1216
01:26:31,575 --> 01:26:33,034
Will you pray with us?

1217
01:26:45,385 --> 01:26:49,435
Jesus, our Savior, we thank you
for blessing Captain Whitaker.

1218
01:26:49,435 --> 01:26:52,813
For guiding his hand
on that fateful morning.

1219
01:26:54,055 --> 01:26:55,732
– Bye.
– It's on the right.

1220
01:26:55,732 --> 01:26:57,724
– Thanks for the ride.
– Okay.

1221
01:27:21,955 --> 01:27:23,479
Oh hey, look.

1222
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:25,866
Great, ain't it?

1223
01:27:25,866 --> 01:27:27,054
It's kind of beautiful.

1224
01:27:27,054 --> 01:27:28,838
It is beautiful, I know, like you.

1225
01:27:28,838 --> 01:27:31,096
– Does it work?
– Yes it works.

1226
01:27:31,096 --> 01:27:33,459
I learned how to fly on this baby.

1227
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:37,185
Me and my friend Holling, we...
we flew to Jamaica.

1228
01:27:37,185 --> 01:27:38,608
– Jamaica, in this?

1229
01:27:38,608 --> 01:27:40,054
– Jamaica, in this?
– Yeah, in this.

1230
01:27:40,327 --> 01:27:42,824
We went on a overnight fishing trip about

1231
01:27:43,027 --> 01:27:45,410
two hours south to here,
and next thing you know,

1232
01:27:45,755 --> 01:27:47,293
Bethel, Jamaica.

1233
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:50,322
– You're insane.
– Yes, I am.

1234
01:27:50,599 --> 01:27:53,339
It was beautiful, just like a... postcard,

1235
01:27:53,339 --> 01:27:56,610
you know, one of those
gipsy postcards with...

1236
01:27:56,610 --> 01:28:00,315
white sand, beautiful... sky, blue sea.

1237
01:28:01,642 --> 01:28:03,538
It's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.

1238
01:28:05,380 --> 01:28:08,072
Was the water warm?

1239
01:28:08,072 --> 01:28:09,500
Yes, that was very warm.

1240
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:10,722
That’s my kind of place.

1241
01:28:12,469 --> 01:28:13,656
Let's go.

1242
01:28:14,602 --> 01:28:15,919
Sure, why not.

1243
01:28:17,287 --> 01:28:18,745
Yeah, let's go tomorrow.

1244
01:28:19,367 --> 01:28:20,359
Oh, you're serious?

1245
01:28:20,359 --> 01:28:23,576
I'm very serious. We go in the morning.
You know, let's just get out of here.

1246
01:28:23,990 --> 01:28:25,355
To start over.
– Wait, we can't-

1247
01:28:25,355 --> 01:28:28,399
Yes we can, it will be beautiful,

1248
01:28:28,399 --> 01:28:30,265
these light bright sand beaches, it's-

1249
01:28:30,265 --> 01:28:31,927
– I'm worried about you.
– It's paradise.

1250
01:28:31,927 --> 01:28:33,913
Don't worry about me, I'm fine, thank you.

1251
01:28:33,913 --> 01:28:36,284
– Whip, you're not, you're really not.
– Yes I am...

1252
01:28:36,284 --> 01:28:37,419
I am.
– You need help.

1253
01:28:38,872 --> 01:28:40,611
You need rehab, Whip.

1254
01:28:42,798 --> 01:28:46,592
Is it-I mean, so you go to two
AA meetings and I need...?

1255
01:28:47,108 --> 01:28:48,022
Okay.

1256
01:28:48,022 --> 01:28:51,523
Hey look, I won't-Jesus Christ,
don't worry about me, okay?

1257
01:28:51,523 --> 01:28:54,440
You just worry about yourself,
don't worry about me.

1258
01:28:54,711 --> 01:28:56,700
– We're the same, you and me.
– No, we're not the same,

1259
01:28:56,700 --> 01:28:58,075
– Yeah we are.
– we are not the same,

1260
01:28:58,075 --> 01:28:59,747
I don't suck dick to get high, okay?

1261
01:28:59,747 --> 01:29:02,090
Don't give me that "your mother died..."
– I never...

1262
01:29:02,090 --> 01:29:03,682
– and your father...
– I never in my life...

1263
01:29:03,682 --> 01:29:05,728
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

1264
01:29:05,728 --> 01:29:06,694
Is that why you shot dope?

1265
01:29:06,694 --> 01:29:07,509
Is that why you shot dope?
– That's not fair.

1266
01:29:07,509 --> 01:29:08,930
That's why you get high?

1267
01:29:08,930 --> 01:29:11,077
There’s a whole lot of people
out there whose mother died,

1268
01:29:11,077 --> 01:29:12,037
they don't fucking drink.

1269
01:29:12,037 --> 01:29:12,608
they don't fucking drink.
– You're sick.

1270
01:29:12,608 --> 01:29:15,296
Yeah, well I'll die and brace it, shit!

1271
01:29:16,414 --> 01:29:18,097
– I choose to drink.
– You do?

1272
01:29:18,097 --> 01:29:19,515
– Yes I do.
– You choose it, well

1273
01:29:19,515 --> 01:29:21,174
I don't see a whole lot
of choice going on here.

1274
01:29:21,174 --> 01:29:24,854
I choose to drink, and I blame myself.
I'm happy to.

1275
01:29:25,570 --> 01:29:28,688
And you know why?
Because I choose to drink.

1276
01:29:29,367 --> 01:29:32,708
I got an... ex-wife and
a son I never talk to.

1277
01:29:33,548 --> 01:29:36,873
And you know why?
Because I choose to drink!

1278
01:29:38,749 --> 01:29:39,869
Nicole.

1279
01:29:57,234 --> 01:29:58,974
Hey. Listen.

1280
01:30:03,393 --> 01:30:04,727
Alright, look...

1281
01:30:07,335 --> 01:30:11,098
I was loaded when... the plane crashed.

1282
01:30:12,124 --> 01:30:14,340
With this investigation, I don't
know what's gonna happen,

1283
01:30:14,340 --> 01:30:16,403
I could go to jail
for the rest of my life.

1284
01:30:17,997 --> 01:30:19,956
I gotta get outta here.

1285
01:30:22,165 --> 01:30:24,232
And I want you to come with me.

1286
01:30:25,834 --> 01:30:26,954
Whip.

1287
01:30:32,003 --> 01:30:34,728
I'm afraid that I'm going
to use again, d'you understand?

1288
01:30:34,728 --> 01:30:36,275
Then come with me.

1289
01:30:36,976 --> 01:30:39,505
Just come with me.
I need help. I do.

1290
01:30:40,812 --> 01:30:42,114
I'd like it if you got help.

1291
01:30:42,114 --> 01:30:45,629
I'll get help, we go straight to Jamaica,
we go to right to the local hospital.

1292
01:30:45,629 --> 01:30:47,060
I'll do it.

1293
01:30:47,377 --> 01:30:49,882
For you, I'll do anyting.
Anything you want.

1294
01:30:53,811 --> 01:30:55,402
I don't want to use again.

1295
01:30:56,915 --> 01:31:00,122
I can't. I... won’t
make it back, Whip.

1296
01:31:01,964 --> 01:31:03,493
I won't force you to stay.

1297
01:31:03,769 --> 01:31:06,282
If you don't like it,
if I'm not sober or whatever,

1298
01:31:06,282 --> 01:31:09,437
then you leave,
I promise you you can leave.

1299
01:31:13,410 --> 01:31:17,368
We can leave before noon.
I’m a great pilot.

1300
01:31:17,626 --> 01:31:20,629
So many beautiful things you get to see.

1301
01:31:22,147 --> 01:31:25,284
I just want you to come with me.

1302
01:32:25,173 --> 01:32:27,286
Everything okay, sweetie?

1303
01:33:10,227 --> 01:33:12,560
<i>You’ve reached the Whitaker
Crop Dusting Company.</i>

1304
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:15,129
<i>Please leave a message
and it will be returned.</i>

1305
01:33:16,365 --> 01:33:17,966
<i>Hey Whip, if you're there, pick up.</i>

1306
01:33:17,966 --> 01:33:19,795
<i>It's Charlie, I've got some good news.</i>

1307
01:33:53,016 --> 01:33:55,240
Aah, there's our man!

1308
01:33:55,240 --> 01:33:56,373
Hey!

1309
01:33:58,037 --> 01:33:59,857
Captain Whitaker.

1310
01:34:00,345 --> 01:34:02,811
Let me be the first
to say congratulations.

1311
01:34:02,811 --> 01:34:04,652
It's a good day. We've won.

1312
01:34:05,116 --> 01:34:07,385
Yeah, this is what we call
in my profession a "walk-over".

1313
01:34:07,889 --> 01:34:09,925
Yeah, they sheduled the
hearing, it's ten days away,

1314
01:34:09,925 --> 01:34:11,804
I can be tough, but
you just got to be sharp,

1315
01:34:11,804 --> 01:34:14,093
stay focused, answer
the questions correctly.

1316
01:34:14,093 --> 01:34:15,669
That's right, then we're good.

1317
01:34:15,669 --> 01:34:17,916
Right, I successfully
had an “Act of God”

1318
01:34:17,916 --> 01:34:20,309
added to the NTSB's list
of probable causes,

1319
01:34:20,309 --> 01:34:22,080
we've shifted suspicion away from you.

1320
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:25,605
It's no longer a question of your
condition, but the condition of the plane.

1321
01:34:26,210 --> 01:34:28,535
That's what I've been
trying to tell everybody.

1322
01:34:29,134 --> 01:34:30,300
Broken plane.

1323
01:34:30,300 --> 01:34:32,011
That's right.

1324
01:34:32,261 --> 01:34:35,156
About the... the toxocologiy report?

1325
01:34:35,156 --> 01:34:36,984
Oh, I killed that.

1326
01:34:37,952 --> 01:34:40,939
There is no physical proof that
you were intoxicated on that plane,

1327
01:34:40,939 --> 01:34:42,257
and no eyewitnesses.

1328
01:34:42,257 --> 01:34:45,140
Why we're here?
We're good!?

1329
01:34:45,687 --> 01:34:48,727
Uh... Because there is a...
a small problem.

1330
01:34:48,727 --> 01:34:51,466
Because of the turbulence,
there was no drink service on the flight.

1331
01:34:52,079 --> 01:34:56,128
But they did find two empty
vodka bottles in the galley trash.

1332
01:34:56,457 --> 01:34:57,857
And... uh...

1333
01:34:58,294 --> 01:35:00,645
And there's no physical
evidence on the bottles,

1334
01:35:00,645 --> 01:35:03,481
no DNA, no fingerprints to link
them to anyone, but

1335
01:35:03,481 --> 01:35:05,163
they were uncapped and empty.

1336
01:35:05,374 --> 01:35:08,457
And the only people who would
have had access to those bottles

1337
01:35:08,682 --> 01:35:10,156
would be the flight crew.

1338
01:35:10,399 --> 01:35:14,084
Now Margaret Evans and Camelia Satou,

1339
01:35:14,390 --> 01:35:18,332
they all had clean tox reports.
So that only leaves you,

1340
01:35:18,332 --> 01:35:19,754
– and, uh...
– Trina Marquez.

1341
01:35:19,754 --> 01:35:21,744
Right, Trina Marquez.

1342
01:35:23,699 --> 01:35:24,819
Okay.

1343
01:35:26,326 --> 01:35:28,964
Okay, I see where we're going here.

1344
01:35:29,844 --> 01:35:32,873
That's funny tough, you know,
that they only found two bottles.

1345
01:35:32,873 --> 01:35:33,787
– Why's that?

1346
01:35:33,787 --> 01:35:35,074
– Why's that?
– I drank three.

1347
01:35:36,665 --> 01:35:38,482
One's missing.

1348
01:35:40,376 --> 01:35:42,780
You know, when I first met you,

1349
01:35:42,780 --> 01:35:46,326
I couldn't believe what a drunk
arrogant scumbag you were.

1350
01:35:46,326 --> 01:35:47,224
– Oh really?
– Yeah.

1351
01:35:47,224 --> 01:35:48,026
Oh, thank you, you-

1352
01:35:48,026 --> 01:35:50,106
But I did the research, Captain Whitaker.

1353
01:35:50,106 --> 01:35:51,992
I heard the expert analyzes

1354
01:35:51,992 --> 01:35:54,063
and I got to tell you,
I’m in awe of what you did.

1355
01:35:54,985 --> 01:35:59,412
The FAA and the NTSB took ten pilots,
placed them in simulators,

1356
01:35:59,412 --> 01:36:02,799
recreated the events that led to
this plane falling out of the sky.

1357
01:36:03,085 --> 01:36:06,028
Do you know how many of them
were able to safely land the planes?

1358
01:36:06,443 --> 01:36:07,349
Not one.

1359
01:36:07,755 --> 01:36:09,833
Every pilot crashed the aircraft.

1360
01:36:10,047 --> 01:36:11,459
Killed everybody on board.

1361
01:36:11,459 --> 01:36:12,981
You're the only one who could do it.

1362
01:36:13,420 --> 01:36:14,206
Great.

1363
01:36:15,795 --> 01:36:16,741
I'm going home.

1364
01:36:16,741 --> 01:36:17,480
I'm going home.
– Hey.

1365
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:19,281
Captain Whitaker, I'm telling you right now,
– Whip, Whip, you can't...

1366
01:36:19,281 --> 01:36:21,055
– you walk away, you're going to prison.
– Listen man.

1367
01:36:21,055 --> 01:36:22,652
I'm trying to save your fucking life.

1368
01:36:22,652 --> 01:36:23,980
What fucking life?

1369
01:36:24,528 --> 01:36:27,010
Uh? Don’t kill yourself
on my account, Hugh!

1370
01:36:27,010 --> 01:36:31,028
Captain Whitaker, this NTSB hearing
is a federal agency hearing.

1371
01:36:31,028 --> 01:36:31,554
Do you understand that?

1372
01:36:31,554 --> 01:36:32,700
Do you understand that?
– Yes, I understand that.

1373
01:36:32,700 --> 01:36:35,398
Okay, well we can't play
around with these people.

1374
01:36:35,717 --> 01:36:38,378
Now we walk in there
like this, with this...

1375
01:36:38,699 --> 01:36:39,978
we're done.

1376
01:36:39,978 --> 01:36:42,409
Everything we've done
goes right out the window.

1377
01:36:43,300 --> 01:36:47,141
I have no more moves, alright?
It's all on you right now.

1378
01:36:50,754 --> 01:36:53,503
Ok, Charlie, just get him
to the church on time.

1379
01:36:53,753 --> 01:36:55,828
Get him to the church on time.

1380
01:36:55,828 --> 01:37:00,619
Yeah Charlie, just keep him nice and
sober, so he can save your fucking union.

1381
01:37:00,619 --> 01:37:05,005
Uh? And that fucking airline.
Fuck you Charlie, fuck you.

1382
01:38:07,424 --> 01:38:08,682
It's him.

1383
01:38:09,088 --> 01:38:10,908
Yeah. I's him already.

1384
01:38:17,839 --> 01:38:19,239
How're you doin'?

1385
01:38:20,070 --> 01:38:21,401
What are you doing here?

1386
01:38:22,841 --> 01:38:25,213
It's good to see you too, Deana.
May I come in?

1387
01:38:27,464 --> 01:38:29,564
I just thought I'd come by and...

1388
01:38:30,128 --> 01:38:32,243
see how you and Will were doing.
Will?

1389
01:38:32,243 --> 01:38:33,618
Knuckles?

1390
01:38:34,543 --> 01:38:36,947
I'd like-you know, we
haven’t talked in a while,

1391
01:38:36,947 --> 01:38:40,321
so with this whole thing happenin' I just
thought I'd come by and we'd... talk.

1392
01:38:41,581 --> 01:38:43,859
You know that I prefer
that you call us.

1393
01:38:43,859 --> 01:38:46,403
Right, right, to call you, but I mean...

1394
01:38:47,774 --> 01:38:50,685
Not like anybody around here calls me...

1395
01:38:50,685 --> 01:38:53,637
the last three years only
to ask for some money.

1396
01:38:54,709 --> 01:38:56,300
Have you been drinking?

1397
01:38:56,620 --> 01:38:58,120
Well, that didn't take long, did it?

1398
01:38:58,120 --> 01:39:01,965
Hey... 17 seconds...
Yeah, exactly 17 seconds.

1399
01:39:01,965 --> 01:39:04,089
– Ladies and gentlemen, it took exactly
– Fucking hell, could you just leave!

1400
01:39:04,089 --> 01:39:07,941
17 seconds before my ex-wife Deana
Coleman asked me if I was drinking,

1401
01:39:07,941 --> 01:39:09,142
what the hell.
– Just leave!

1402
01:39:09,142 --> 01:39:11,655
A world record. Leave the house
that I pay for.

1403
01:39:11,655 --> 01:39:13,569
Is that you want me to do?
– Oh. I'll call the police.

1404
01:39:13,569 --> 01:39:14,530
Call the police.

1405
01:39:14,933 --> 01:39:15,938
– I'm telling you-
– Will!

1406
01:39:15,938 --> 01:39:17,883
Whitaker Jr! How're you doing, son?

1407
01:39:18,126 --> 01:39:20,992
Man of the house.
Thanks for calling me back.

1408
01:39:20,992 --> 01:39:23,240
I'm telling you to leave.

1409
01:39:24,296 --> 01:39:25,696
Are you?

1410
01:39:26,171 --> 01:39:27,535
You're the man of the house now.

1411
01:39:27,535 --> 01:39:29,709
You upset my mother.
You gotta go.

1412
01:39:30,199 --> 01:39:31,801
Well, I’m your father, tough guy.

1413
01:39:31,801 --> 01:39:32,746
You're a drunk.

1414
01:39:34,407 --> 01:39:36,968
I'm a drunk?
You don't know who the fuck I am.

1415
01:39:36,968 --> 01:39:39,312
I sure don't!
Won't you tell me!

1416
01:39:39,312 --> 01:39:41,568
Who the fuck are you, uh?
Who are you?

1417
01:39:42,435 --> 01:39:44,151
Get the fuck out.

1418
01:39:46,842 --> 01:39:47,988
Stop it! Stop it!

1419
01:39:47,988 --> 01:39:49,402
Stop it! Stop it!

1420
01:39:49,402 --> 01:39:51,019
– I love you son.
– Get the fuck out!

1421
01:39:51,394 --> 01:39:54,258
– Get the fuck out!
– Get out now!

1422
01:39:55,231 --> 01:39:57,142
I know where I'm not wanted.

1423
01:39:58,227 --> 01:40:01,219
Captain Whitaker, a lot of people are
working to keep you out of the media,

1424
01:40:01,219 --> 01:40:02,335
are you hiding something?

1425
01:40:02,335 --> 01:40:04,414
Leave my family some room, please.

1426
01:40:04,414 --> 01:40:09,318
This is not the appropriate time.
At the appropriate time, I will, uh...

1427
01:40:09,631 --> 01:40:11,699
tell my story, and uh...

1428
01:40:11,699 --> 01:40:13,831
now is the time for grieving.

1429
01:40:14,594 --> 01:40:16,414
<i>And uh...</i>

1430
01:40:16,662 --> 01:40:18,535
<i>taking care of the injured. Thank you.</i>

1431
01:40:19,354 --> 01:40:22,154
<i>.. questions remain about the flight,
but they won't be answered today,</i>

1432
01:40:22,154 --> 01:40:26,196
<i>as Captain Whitaker politely asked
that we give his familly some peace.</i>

1433
01:40:26,196 --> 01:40:30,383
<i>A reasonable request from a quiet
heroic man, who’s been through-</i>

1434
01:40:30,383 --> 01:40:31,773
Hey Charlie.

1435
01:40:35,229 --> 01:40:37,596
Look, it's just that I just
couldn't find a safe place, uh,

1436
01:40:37,596 --> 01:40:39,658
Amanda was kind enough
to let me in, and-

1437
01:40:39,658 --> 01:40:40,596
– Yeah.
– Thank you.

1438
01:40:40,596 --> 01:40:42,043
Are you sure I can't get you something...

1439
01:40:42,043 --> 01:40:43,694
No. We're trough.

1440
01:40:43,694 --> 01:40:46,148
But thank you.
Thank you very much.

1441
01:40:48,076 --> 01:40:49,683
Now what the hell is wrong with you?

1442
01:40:50,394 --> 01:40:51,425
Really...

1443
01:40:52,077 --> 01:40:55,254
Hugh just called me, apparently
you went to your ex-wife's house,

1444
01:40:55,254 --> 01:40:57,877
drunk as a skunk, the news crew showed up,

1445
01:40:57,877 --> 01:40:59,653
and then the police escort you out!

1446
01:40:59,653 --> 01:41:01,668
It’s okay, though.
I’ve been watching, it’s okay.

1447
01:41:01,668 --> 01:41:04,074
Oh yeah, no, Hugh checked
all the media outlet that covered,

1448
01:41:04,074 --> 01:41:06,228
you come off-you come off fine,
so I guess we're good.

1449
01:41:06,228 --> 01:41:08,312
Good, ok, here's the deal. I-

1450
01:41:08,312 --> 01:41:10,688
No Whip, Whip, there's no deal.
Sorry, look at you.

1451
01:41:10,688 --> 01:41:14,540
I got no idea what you’re gonna do
or say, ever. You’re all over the place.

1452
01:41:14,540 --> 01:41:17,015
I was the one guy in your court.
The one guy.

1453
01:41:17,219 --> 01:41:20,052
I was your defender and
your apologist, but no more!

1454
01:41:20,267 --> 01:41:21,529
Charlie, I can do this.

1455
01:41:21,529 --> 01:41:24,435
You're about to be questioned
by a Federal agency about

1456
01:41:24,435 --> 01:41:28,755
piloting an airliner drunk, an airliner
that crashed, and you continue to drink!

1457
01:41:28,755 --> 01:41:31,311
And stumble around. What kind
of crazy ya have to be to do that?

1458
01:41:31,311 --> 01:41:33,692
I'm afraid of you.
– Ok alright, let me stay with you.

1459
01:41:33,937 --> 01:41:36,044
Let me stay with you, they're
staking out all my houses anyway,

1460
01:41:36,044 --> 01:41:37,845
I'll stay with you, until...

1461
01:41:37,845 --> 01:41:41,041
you know un-
until the hearing.

1462
01:41:41,382 --> 01:41:43,309
I won't leave the house.

1463
01:41:46,122 --> 01:41:48,412
I won't.

1464
01:41:49,767 --> 01:41:50,956
– You cannot drink in my house.

1465
01:41:50,956 --> 01:41:52,117
– You cannot drink in my house.
– I won't, I won't, I won't.

1466
01:41:52,117 --> 01:41:53,711
Whip, you can't have a drink.

1467
01:41:54,961 --> 01:41:56,361
I won't.

1468
01:42:02,839 --> 01:42:04,720
– Officer Edmonds.
– Yes sir.

1469
01:42:05,338 --> 01:42:07,390
Whip, this is officer Edmonds,
he'll be staying here tonight.

1470
01:42:07,390 --> 01:42:09,093
Any problems, he’ll handle it.

1471
01:42:13,064 --> 01:42:15,093
Captain Whitaker.
You...

1472
01:42:15,757 --> 01:42:17,850
you look great.
I mean that.

1473
01:42:18,189 --> 01:42:20,038
Thank you. Thank you very much.
I feel good.

1474
01:42:20,481 --> 01:42:22,674
Charlie tells you haven't
had a drink in eight days.

1475
01:42:22,674 --> 01:42:26,221
Nine days. Two hours, 26 minutes,
but who's counting?

1476
01:42:26,221 --> 01:42:28,945
Okay. Right here.

1477
01:42:30,429 --> 01:42:33,093
So yeah, we want to make this
as easy as possible...

1478
01:42:33,093 --> 01:42:34,695
on you, I hope this is okay.

1479
01:42:34,695 --> 01:42:36,914
Maybe just relax, and get some rest,

1480
01:42:36,914 --> 01:42:38,952
order up a steak, get a movie.

1481
01:42:39,430 --> 01:42:44,713
I made a copy of the entire...
investigation, my file on you.

1482
01:42:45,805 --> 01:42:49,326
I was trying to anticipate what kinds of
questions they might ask you under oath,

1483
01:42:49,326 --> 01:42:52,481
and I wrote some
non-damaging responses, so...

1484
01:42:52,481 --> 01:42:56,297
It's all in there. You know,
it's photos, and... interviews,

1485
01:42:56,297 --> 01:42:58,001
there's some testimony in there.

1486
01:42:58,602 --> 01:43:01,392
Called Ellen Block, told her
you're here, you're all tucked in.

1487
01:43:02,466 --> 01:43:04,073
She got the knife out for me?

1488
01:43:06,355 --> 01:43:09,641
Well, look. She's not happy that
I killed the tox report, but

1489
01:43:09,641 --> 01:43:13,815
this isn't a trial. So she's very limited
in the kinds of questions she can ask you.

1490
01:43:13,815 --> 01:43:15,552
You know. You're gonna be fine.

1491
01:43:15,552 --> 01:43:19,824
Yeah. The hearing's at ten,
so uh... just downstairs, so

1492
01:43:19,824 --> 01:43:22,667
we'll figure we can meet here at nine
for breakfast in our room,

1493
01:43:22,933 --> 01:43:24,485
and, uh...

1494
01:43:24,905 --> 01:43:26,391
take it from there.

1495
01:43:27,382 --> 01:43:29,466
Alright, captain Whitaker.
See you in the morning.

1496
01:43:29,466 --> 01:43:32,292
Thank you, and thank you...
for letting me stay in your house,

1497
01:43:32,292 --> 01:43:34,016
you have a beautiful home,
beautiful family, and-

1498
01:43:34,016 --> 01:43:35,155
You did great. I'm happy.

1499
01:43:35,155 --> 01:43:36,342
I needed it. I needed it.

1500
01:43:36,819 --> 01:43:38,960
– It's alright.
– I'm happy we did it.

1501
01:43:40,024 --> 01:43:40,785
– Alright,
– Okay.

1502
01:43:40,785 --> 01:43:42,115
– see you in the morning.
– Yes.

1503
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:52,807
Looks like fine...

1504
01:46:13,823 --> 01:46:14,943
Hello?

1505
01:46:36,586 --> 01:46:37,706
Hello?

1506
01:48:58,607 --> 01:48:59,592
– How's our man?

1507
01:48:59,592 --> 01:49:01,175
– How's our man?
– Not a peep.

1508
01:49:09,192 --> 01:49:11,371
Maybe he overslept.

1509
01:49:12,611 --> 01:49:14,960
Didn't let any girls in there
last night, did you?

1510
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:16,252
No sir.

1511
01:49:16,651 --> 01:49:19,977
Not a soul, no one came in or
out outside of... room service.

1512
01:49:25,490 --> 01:49:26,911
You have a key?

1513
01:49:27,668 --> 01:49:29,043
Hey Whip.

1514
01:49:29,824 --> 01:49:32,181
Hey buddy?
Whip!

1515
01:49:32,502 --> 01:49:33,622
Shit.

1516
01:49:36,782 --> 01:49:39,764
Where the fucking fuck is he?
Oh Jeez.

1517
01:49:39,764 --> 01:49:41,865
Where is he?
Where is he, where is he?

1518
01:49:41,865 --> 01:49:42,618
I don't know.

1519
01:49:42,618 --> 01:49:44,618
Did he fucking walk away?
Son of a bitch!

1520
01:49:44,618 --> 01:49:45,841
Hugh. Hugh.

1521
01:49:45,841 --> 01:49:46,594
Whip!

1522
01:49:47,978 --> 01:49:49,122
– Get a med.
– Yak, damnit!

1523
01:49:49,122 --> 01:49:50,944
– Oh no, is he dead?
– I don't know.

1524
01:49:50,944 --> 01:49:52,444
– Is he dead?
– I don't know!

1525
01:49:52,444 --> 01:49:53,762
Yeah, I'm dead, yeah!

1526
01:49:53,762 --> 01:49:55,512
Do you want me to get an ambulance?

1527
01:49:55,512 --> 01:49:56,518
No, no no.

1528
01:49:56,518 --> 01:49:57,550
No, no no.

1529
01:49:57,550 --> 01:49:58,760
Look, uh...

1530
01:49:58,760 --> 01:50:00,709
Let's just get the bed.

1531
01:50:00,709 --> 01:50:03,139
– Come on. Come on.
– It's alright, that's alright.

1532
01:50:03,807 --> 01:50:06,414
That's it, Charlie.
Ok, that's it, we're fucked, man.

1533
01:50:06,414 --> 01:50:08,872
Your guy is just fucked,
your guy is just fucked, Charlie!

1534
01:50:08,872 --> 01:50:11,520
Alright. You just get on the front door,
make sure nobody comes in.

1535
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:12,597
Put that on your head, you...

1536
01:50:12,597 --> 01:50:13,732
can't go, man.
– Get there, hey!

1537
01:50:13,732 --> 01:50:14,797
What time is it?

1538
01:50:14,797 --> 01:50:16,354
– We got 45 minutes, okay?

1539
01:50:16,354 --> 01:50:17,905
Well, how much grace you think we got?

1540
01:50:17,905 --> 01:50:21,232
Grace? Ellen Block?
We're gonna get some fucking grace?

1541
01:50:21,232 --> 01:50:24,237
Well, we probably got an hour before
we really gotta get him downstairs.

1542
01:50:24,237 --> 01:50:27,029
Okay great, but let's just get a wheelchair,
and wheel his ass into the hearing.

1543
01:50:27,029 --> 01:50:28,180
Call Harling Mays, man.

1544
01:50:28,180 --> 01:50:29,375
Call Harling, he's got a wheelchair?

1545
01:50:29,375 --> 01:50:31,735
He got cocaine, isn' it?

1546
01:50:32,001 --> 01:50:33,254
Cocaine?

1547
01:50:38,437 --> 01:50:39,343
Hey bro.

1548
01:50:40,188 --> 01:50:42,967
Harling Mays. I'm on the list.

1549
01:50:42,967 --> 01:50:44,259
Well.

1550
01:50:45,786 --> 01:50:47,542
What's the deal, buddy?

1551
01:50:47,542 --> 01:50:50,072
You look like you're hurt, for certain.

1552
01:50:50,072 --> 01:50:52,674
– Thanks for com-
– Do not touch the merch, motherfucker!

1553
01:50:56,842 --> 01:50:58,679
Take one step back, please.

1554
01:51:00,898 --> 01:51:04,599
C-Lo, I need you outside guarding
the door please, thank you very much.

1555
01:51:06,959 --> 01:51:08,464
– It's alright.
– Yeah.

1556
01:51:09,025 --> 01:51:10,118
Alright gentlemen.

1557
01:51:10,118 --> 01:51:13,697
I need that table cleared, placed in
front of Whip, with the chair behind it.

1558
01:51:14,365 --> 01:51:15,815
Now please!

1559
01:51:18,302 --> 01:51:23,401
I need a glass of water, I need a credit
card, I need a hundred dollar bill.

1560
01:51:23,695 --> 01:51:24,936
– I got a 20.

1561
01:51:24,936 --> 01:51:26,217
– I got a 20.
– She'll do.

1562
01:51:27,883 --> 01:51:29,825
Whip, being unable to come!?

1563
01:51:29,825 --> 01:51:31,823
And I need a coco puff.

1564
01:51:32,534 --> 01:51:33,578
A what?

1565
01:51:34,578 --> 01:51:38,904
Just take the tinyest little bit of tobacco
out of the top of a cigarette, please.

1566
01:51:39,131 --> 01:51:41,372
Damn. Amateur, man.

1567
01:51:42,587 --> 01:51:44,998
We're almost home, okay baby.

1568
01:51:45,591 --> 01:51:47,284
We're gonna do....

1569
01:51:48,081 --> 01:51:49,901
two small whiffs first...

1570
01:51:52,134 --> 01:51:54,499
One on each side.

1571
01:51:54,499 --> 01:51:57,811
Just a little primer, to get it started.

1572
01:51:59,629 --> 01:52:01,588
"Coco Puff".

1573
01:52:12,697 --> 01:52:14,330
Good boy, atta boy, head back.

1574
01:52:14,330 --> 01:52:17,000
Swallow. Water.
Water, now! Chief, you.

1575
01:52:30,647 --> 01:52:32,808
Little coco puff, buddy.

1576
01:52:34,103 --> 01:52:35,694
Who's the banana man?

1577
01:52:35,694 --> 01:52:38,085
– You.
– Who's the banana man, alright.

1578
01:52:38,297 --> 01:52:40,044
Now focus up, big dog.

1579
01:52:45,974 --> 01:52:47,190
– There's a train coming to you.

1580
01:52:47,190 --> 01:52:49,191
– There's a train coming to you.
– Yeah.

1581
01:52:49,497 --> 01:52:51,213
Keep it down, big dog.

1582
01:52:52,489 --> 01:52:54,596
Banana boat's coming.
Where's banana boat?

1583
01:52:54,596 --> 01:52:55,991
– Banana boat is here.

1584
01:52:55,991 --> 01:52:57,406
– Banana boat is here.
– Alright.

1585
01:53:01,118 --> 01:53:03,014
Nothing keeps you down dog.

1586
01:53:03,903 --> 01:53:06,076
Nothing keeps that big dog down.

1587
01:53:09,248 --> 01:53:10,613
Guy, you're up.

1588
01:53:12,562 --> 01:53:13,272
– Oh, uh-

1589
01:53:13,272 --> 01:53:14,534
– Oh, uh-
– I don't, uhm...

1590
01:53:15,292 --> 01:53:16,404
That won't do any help, thank you.

1591
01:53:16,404 --> 01:53:18,438
That won't do any help, thank you.
– Shit, I'm taking that with you.

1592
01:53:27,242 --> 01:53:28,507
Thank you, brother.

1593
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:30,879
– Shit, I'm back.
– Aha baby.

1594
01:53:31,328 --> 01:53:32,848
– I love you.
– I love you.

1595
01:53:40,151 --> 01:53:43,781
Alright. Which of one you gentlemen
is flowing in this enterprise?

1596
01:53:44,441 --> 01:53:45,509
Alright.

1597
01:53:45,509 --> 01:53:48,641
It's 500 bucks, I got...
you know, I got like 80 bucks on me.

1598
01:53:49,525 --> 01:53:50,702
I just need...

1599
01:53:50,702 --> 01:53:52,897
How much you got?
– I got it, I got it.

1600
01:53:52,897 --> 01:53:54,560
Alright.
– Here.

1601
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:55,685
– Just...
– What the...

1602
01:53:55,685 --> 01:53:57,679
– You pay him.
– Pay him?

1603
01:53:57,679 --> 01:53:59,918
Thank you.
Okay.

1604
01:54:00,756 --> 01:54:02,495
There's a gram in here.

1605
01:54:02,718 --> 01:54:06,270
You take it, you've paid for it,
he's gonna need it later.

1606
01:54:07,698 --> 01:54:09,797
My work here is finished.

1607
01:54:12,752 --> 01:54:15,212
See you all on the dark side of the moon.

1608
01:54:15,212 --> 01:54:17,301
<i>?Feeling alright...</i>

1609
01:54:19,659 --> 01:54:21,887
<i>?I'm not feeling that good myself...</i>

1610
01:54:25,815 --> 01:54:27,594
<i>?Feeling alright...</i>

1611
01:54:30,664 --> 01:54:33,044
<i>?I'm not feeling that good myself...</i>

1612
01:55:05,853 --> 01:55:07,413
I'll go ahead and tell ‘em we're here.

1613
01:55:07,694 --> 01:55:08,593
You’re gonna make it.

1614
01:55:08,593 --> 01:55:10,553
Remember, if they ask about your drinking,

1615
01:55:10,553 --> 01:55:12,812
it’s totally acceptable
to say, “I don’t recall.”

1616
01:55:12,812 --> 01:55:15,922
Hey, don't tell me how
to lie about my drinking, okay?

1617
01:55:16,481 --> 01:55:20,129
I’m gonna lie about my drinking, I've been
lying about my drinking my whole life.

1618
01:55:37,602 --> 01:55:39,443
Those are difficult images to watch.

1619
01:55:39,443 --> 01:55:42,670
For the record, I'm Ellen Block,
Hearing Officer for this hearing.

1620
01:55:42,670 --> 01:55:44,464
Captain Whitaker, good morning.

1621
01:55:44,464 --> 01:55:46,362
Morning.
Morning.

1622
01:55:46,578 --> 01:55:51,198
What that video captures is that the
aircraft was in a relatively stable glide

1623
01:55:51,198 --> 01:55:53,213
just prior to the moment of impact.

1624
01:55:53,555 --> 01:55:57,884
However, according to the data we retreived
from the cockpit flight data recorders,

1625
01:55:57,884 --> 01:56:02,581
at exactly 9:34, after flying
27 minutes without incident,

1626
01:56:02,581 --> 01:56:08,872
the transponder recorded a loss in
altitude in excess of 4800 feet per minute

1627
01:56:08,872 --> 01:56:12,643
in what is considered a
“full pitch nose down” attitude.

1628
01:56:12,889 --> 01:56:17,254
Then, at 9:42, according
to the data recorders,

1629
01:56:17,254 --> 01:56:20,736
a decision was made to
invert the aircraft.

1630
01:56:20,736 --> 01:56:25,328
The NTSB has created animated simulation
that I would like to play at this point.

1631
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:27,617
<i>- We gonna roll it, okay?</i>

1632
01:56:27,617 --> 01:56:28,784
<i>- We gonna roll it, okay?
– What do you mean, roll it?</i>

1633
01:56:28,784 --> 01:56:30,870
<i>We gotta do something to stop this dive.</i>

1634
01:56:30,870 --> 01:56:32,769
<i>Margaret. What's your son's name?</i>

1635
01:56:32,769 --> 01:56:33,878
<i>Trevor.</i>

1636
01:56:33,878 --> 01:56:34,807
<i>- Say "I love you, Trevor".</i>

1637
01:56:34,807 --> 01:56:35,408
<i>- Say "I love you, Trevor".
– What?</i>

1638
01:56:35,408 --> 01:56:36,399
<i>- Black box. Say "I love you Trevor".</i>

1639
01:56:36,399 --> 01:56:37,308
<i>- Black box. Say "I love you Trevor".
– "I love you Trevor".</i>

1640
01:56:37,308 --> 01:56:39,474
<i>You be a good boy.
Mommy loves you.</i>

1641
01:56:39,474 --> 01:56:42,246
<i>Okay, here we go. I've got control.</i>

1642
01:56:42,246 --> 01:56:45,277
<i>Oh good Lord.
Jesus!</i>

1643
01:56:46,256 --> 01:56:47,581
<i>- Flaps out.
– Flaps out!</i>

1644
01:56:47,581 --> 01:56:49,652
<i>- Speed brakes.
– Speed brakes!</i>

1645
01:56:50,506 --> 01:56:52,386
<i>Margaret.
Power!</i>

1646
01:56:52,658 --> 01:56:54,194
<i>- Gear up.
– Gear up!</i>

1647
01:56:54,194 --> 01:56:56,296
<i>Oh, Lord Jesus, we're inverted!</i>

1648
01:56:56,296 --> 01:56:59,037
<i>Good flying lesson... We’re leve...
...maintain alt... like this.</i>

1649
01:56:59,037 --> 01:57:03,999
<i>Atlan... 2-2-7... we are inverted,
I... we are... verted.</i>

1650
01:57:03,999 --> 01:57:07,394
<i>Southj... 2... 7... did you say inverted?</i>

1651
01:57:08,771 --> 01:57:11,714
That audio is tragic and compelling.

1652
01:57:11,714 --> 01:57:13,918
I chose to play that part
of the cockpit recording

1653
01:57:13,918 --> 01:57:17,673
to highlight a key moment
onboard flight 2-2-7,

1654
01:57:17,673 --> 01:57:22,786
wherein you say “We’re gonna roll it,
here we go, I’ve got control.”

1655
01:57:22,998 --> 01:57:26,667
You made a very conscious
decision to invert the aircraft,

1656
01:57:26,667 --> 01:57:29,647
to roll the plane upside down.
Is that correct?

1657
01:57:32,446 --> 01:57:36,552
I'm not sure if it was
conscious, but uh...

1658
01:57:37,156 --> 01:57:38,981
it was more like instinct.

1659
01:57:39,929 --> 01:57:41,763
What led to that decision?

1660
01:57:46,292 --> 01:57:47,660
I don't recall.

1661
01:57:48,151 --> 01:57:50,055
Let me quote from an
investigative summary

1662
01:57:50,055 --> 01:57:54,430
”From 9:34 until 9:42
the events on the aircraft are”,

1663
01:57:54,430 --> 01:57:57,512
again I quote, “bold and remarkable”.

1664
01:57:58,054 --> 01:58:01,845
“By inverting the plane, Captain
Whitaker arrested the descent,

1665
01:58:01,845 --> 01:58:04,335
and allowed the aircraft to level off,

1666
01:58:04,335 --> 01:58:08,633
enabling him to glide the aircraft
away from any populated areas,

1667
01:58:08,633 --> 01:58:12,825
and allowing him to execute
a forced landing in an open field.

1668
01:58:22,433 --> 01:58:24,821
I heard a loud metallic bang.

1669
01:58:25,712 --> 01:58:27,524
We pitched nose down.

1670
01:58:29,407 --> 01:58:30,342
No control.

1671
01:58:30,342 --> 01:58:33,881
Yeah. First Officer Evans
testimony confirms the same.

1672
01:58:36,923 --> 01:58:38,241
I want to show you something.

1673
01:58:43,036 --> 01:58:44,877
Nothing's happening, uh...

1674
01:58:45,674 --> 01:58:49,141
Its remote control isn't working,
apologies, I can do this manually.

1675
01:59:00,506 --> 01:59:03,949
This is the jackscrew on the
tail assembly that articulates

1676
01:59:03,949 --> 01:59:07,794
the horizontal stabilizer...
also known as the elevator.

1677
01:59:08,166 --> 01:59:12,602
As you can see, the threads on
this screw are almost entirely gone.

1678
01:59:13,175 --> 01:59:19,040
This part was suggested as a maintenance
replacement in January of 2011.

1679
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:20,668
It was never replaced.

1680
01:59:20,895 --> 01:59:24,970
It had an additional 1200 hours
of flight on it. It finally failed.

1681
01:59:25,343 --> 01:59:30,177
Our investigators have concluded
that the jackscrew snapped

1682
01:59:30,177 --> 01:59:34,004
and the elevator was frozen
in a fixed position,

1683
01:59:34,362 --> 01:59:39,250
locking the elevator in a down position
which forced the plane into a dive.

1684
01:59:39,517 --> 01:59:43,389
The loss of the elevator was,
and I quote our report,

1685
01:59:43,389 --> 01:59:47,106
“a catastrophic event, from
which recovery was improbable

1686
01:59:47,106 --> 01:59:49,559
and stable flight, impossible.”

1687
01:59:53,215 --> 01:59:54,335
Mr. Whitaker...

1688
01:59:55,307 --> 01:59:59,984
I want to talk about the days leading
and the hours leading up to the accident.

1689
01:59:59,984 --> 02:00:03,102
But before I do, I want to
remind you that you are under oath,

1690
02:00:03,102 --> 02:00:06,610
and that any testimony you'll give here
today will be considered admissable

1691
02:00:06,610 --> 02:00:09,343
in any subsequent hearings
or criminal proceedings.

1692
02:00:09,343 --> 02:00:11,663
Do you understand what that means?

1693
02:00:13,704 --> 02:00:17,217
Captain Whitaker, for the record
I need you to verbalize your answer.

1694
02:00:18,234 --> 02:00:20,661
Uh, I'm sorry.
Yes, I understand.

1695
02:00:21,455 --> 02:00:25,234
On the three days leading up
to the accident: Tuesday, October 11th,

1696
02:00:25,234 --> 02:00:28,780
Wednesday, October 12th
or Thursday, October 13th,

1697
02:00:28,780 --> 02:00:33,040
did you consume any alcohol
or other intoxicating elements?

1698
02:00:34,101 --> 02:00:35,465
No, I did not.

1699
02:00:35,785 --> 02:00:39,642
On the morning of the accident,
Friday, October 14th,

1700
02:00:39,642 --> 02:00:45,050
did you consume any alcohol,
or ingest any chemicals or drugs

1701
02:00:45,050 --> 02:00:48,613
that may have impaired your
ability to perform your job?

1702
02:00:49,246 --> 02:00:50,716
No, I did not.

1703
02:00:51,793 --> 02:00:55,963
Mr. Whitaker, do you now or
have you ever had a problem

1704
02:00:55,963 --> 02:01:00,172
with alcohol dependency,
alcoholism or drug addiction?

1705
02:01:00,172 --> 02:01:01,509
No.

1706
02:01:03,833 --> 02:01:06,346
Okay, Mr. Whitaker, we’re about done.

1707
02:01:13,175 --> 02:01:17,873
Due to the severe turbulence in the
early part of the flight, you asked

1708
02:01:17,873 --> 02:01:21,413
the flight crew to suspend the beverage
service on the plane, is that correct?

1709
02:01:21,662 --> 02:01:25,226
Yes, That's correct, I suspended
the drink service on the plane.

1710
02:01:25,226 --> 02:01:30,022
Are you aware that our investigators
found two single-service vodka bottles

1711
02:01:30,022 --> 02:01:31,471
in the galley trash bin?

1712
02:01:33,985 --> 02:01:35,912
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

1713
02:01:36,559 --> 02:01:38,970
There were five crew members on board

1714
02:01:38,970 --> 02:01:41,611
that who would have had access
to the beverage trolley.

1715
02:01:41,945 --> 02:01:43,916
Less than an hour after the accident,

1716
02:01:43,916 --> 02:01:47,005
blood was taken from each
of these crew members, yourself,

1717
02:01:47,501 --> 02:01:52,108
first officer Evans, flight
attendant Margaret Thomason...

1718
02:01:52,505 --> 02:01:57,901
and posthumously from Camelia
Satou, and Katerina Marquez.

1719
02:01:59,044 --> 02:02:02,262
A toxicology analysis was performed and...

1720
02:02:02,950 --> 02:02:05,047
three of these tests came back negative,

1721
02:02:05,047 --> 02:02:09,115
one was disqualified for
technical reasons, and one...

1722
02:02:09,619 --> 02:02:14,648
tested positive for alcohol.
It registered a .17 blood alcohol level.

1723
02:02:14,648 --> 02:02:16,146
Are you aware of that?

1724
02:02:17,166 --> 02:02:19,056
Yeah. I'm aware of it now.

1725
02:02:25,806 --> 02:02:29,897
Miss Marquez was not only a colleague,
but you knew her outside of work,

1726
02:02:29,897 --> 02:02:31,979
is that correct?

1727
02:02:32,982 --> 02:02:34,662
Outside of work...

1728
02:02:35,584 --> 02:02:36,865
No, not really.

1729
02:02:36,865 --> 02:02:39,643
Did you know Miss Marquez
had a drinking problem?

1730
02:02:40,746 --> 02:02:41,959
No, I did not.

1731
02:02:41,959 --> 02:02:44,393
Did you ever see her drink to excess?

1732
02:02:46,912 --> 02:02:48,378
No, I did not.

1733
02:02:48,378 --> 02:02:51,332
Were you aware that she was
twice treated for alcohol addiction,

1734
02:02:51,332 --> 02:02:55,365
the last time was 16 months ago
and paid for by SouthJet Airlines?

1735
02:02:56,821 --> 02:02:58,221
No, I did not.

1736
02:03:08,588 --> 02:03:15,148
Is it your opinion... that Katerina
Marquez... drank on that flight?

1737
02:03:26,759 --> 02:03:28,554
Could you repeat the question?

1738
02:03:29,308 --> 02:03:33,868
Is it your opinion that Katerina
Marquez drank on that flight?

1739
02:03:45,961 --> 02:03:47,244
I’m sorry. My what?

1740
02:03:47,244 --> 02:03:48,497
Your opinion, Captain.

1741
02:03:48,728 --> 02:03:51,960
Since her toxicology report
is the only toxicology report

1742
02:03:51,960 --> 02:03:56,498
that is admissable in this hearing, and
she in fact tested positive for alcohol,

1743
02:03:56,498 --> 02:04:00,403
is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez

1744
02:04:00,403 --> 02:04:04,128
drank those 2 bottles
of vodka on the plane?

1745
02:04:15,679 --> 02:04:18,895
I’m sorry Mr. Whitaker, I couldn’t
hear you. What did you say?

1746
02:04:21,707 --> 02:04:23,673
I said, "God, help me."

1747
02:04:24,444 --> 02:04:27,293
Yes, well. However, is it your opinion-

1748
02:04:27,293 --> 02:04:28,738
It's my opinion...

1749
02:04:28,997 --> 02:04:30,817
Trina did not...

1750
02:04:31,168 --> 02:04:32,720
drink that Vodka.

1751
02:04:33,389 --> 02:04:34,642
Excuse me, Mr. Whitaker?

1752
02:04:34,642 --> 02:04:36,228
She saved the boy’s life, that's-

1753
02:04:36,228 --> 02:04:37,942
Could you speak louder, Captain Whitaker?

1754
02:04:37,942 --> 02:04:40,491
Trina Marquez did not drink the vodka.

1755
02:04:42,076 --> 02:04:44,183
Because I drank the vodka.

1756
02:04:47,162 --> 02:04:48,339
Objection!

1757
02:04:49,251 --> 02:04:51,167
Please be seated sir. This-

1758
02:04:52,097 --> 02:04:53,217
Sir.

1759
02:04:53,217 --> 02:04:54,245
– I drank the vodka bottles-

1760
02:04:54,245 --> 02:04:55,842
– I drank the vodka bottles-
– Did you hear what I said, I object!

1761
02:04:55,842 --> 02:04:58,373
Please be seated sir,
this is not a court room.

1762
02:04:58,373 --> 02:04:59,893
Well, I object anyway!

1763
02:05:01,379 --> 02:05:03,658
I drank the vodka bottles on the plane.

1764
02:05:05,559 --> 02:05:10,206
Captain Whitaker. On the three nights
before the accident, October 11-

1765
02:05:10,206 --> 02:05:15,308
October 11, October 12 and 13th
and 14th, I was intoxicated.

1766
02:05:15,308 --> 02:05:18,301
I drank all of those days, I drank...

1767
02:05:18,911 --> 02:05:20,311
in excess.

1768
02:05:21,741 --> 02:05:24,613
– On the morning of the accident-
– I was drunk.

1769
02:05:32,675 --> 02:05:34,126
I'm drunk now.

1770
02:05:40,661 --> 02:05:42,386
I'm drunk right now...

1771
02:05:43,020 --> 02:05:44,543
Miss Block...

1772
02:05:51,450 --> 02:05:53,135
because I'm alcoholic.

1773
02:06:19,020 --> 02:06:20,454
That was it.

1774
02:06:24,090 --> 02:06:25,572
I was finished.

1775
02:06:27,532 --> 02:06:28,967
I was done.

1776
02:06:31,959 --> 02:06:37,699
It was as if I had reached
my life long limit... for lies.

1777
02:06:38,982 --> 02:06:41,988
I could not tell one more lie.

1778
02:06:45,514 --> 02:06:47,238
And maybe I'm a sucker.

1779
02:06:49,325 --> 02:06:51,775
Because if I had told just one more lie,

1780
02:06:52,265 --> 02:06:54,830
I could have walked away
from all that mess...

1781
02:06:55,539 --> 02:06:59,118
kept my wings, kept my
false sense of pride...

1782
02:07:01,762 --> 02:07:06,650
and most importantly, I could have avoided
being locked up in here with all of you,

1783
02:07:07,372 --> 02:07:10,244
nice folks for the last 13 months.

1784
02:07:13,859 --> 02:07:15,364
But I'm here.

1785
02:07:16,354 --> 02:07:18,354
And I'll be here for at least the...

1786
02:07:19,034 --> 02:07:21,586
next four or five years.
And that's fair.

1787
02:07:25,467 --> 02:07:28,371
I betrayed the public trust. I did.

1788
02:07:28,371 --> 02:07:32,745
That’s what the judge explained to me.
I had betrayed the public trust.

1789
02:07:34,533 --> 02:07:37,672
The FAA, they took away
my pilot's license.

1790
02:07:39,642 --> 02:07:40,929
And that's fair.

1791
02:07:41,902 --> 02:07:45,493
My chances of ever flying
again are slim to none.

1792
02:07:47,532 --> 02:07:49,178
And I accept that.

1793
02:07:52,003 --> 02:07:55,071
I got a lot of time to think
about it, the all of it.

1794
02:07:57,732 --> 02:07:58,948
Doing some writing.

1795
02:08:00,917 --> 02:08:04,950
I wrote letters to each of the
families that had lost loved ones.

1796
02:08:08,192 --> 02:08:10,213
Some of ‘em were able
to hear my apology...

1797
02:08:12,411 --> 02:08:13,861
some of ‘em never will.

1798
02:08:15,695 --> 02:08:18,224
I also apologized to...

1799
02:08:19,435 --> 02:08:23,964
all the people that tried to help me...
along the way, but I...

1800
02:08:25,643 --> 02:08:28,297
couldn't or wouldn't listen.

1801
02:08:31,605 --> 02:08:33,493
People like my wife...

1802
02:08:37,230 --> 02:08:38,891
My ex-wife...

1803
02:08:43,281 --> 02:08:44,771
My son.

1804
02:08:48,066 --> 02:08:51,174
And again like I said, you know,
some of them will...

1805
02:08:53,587 --> 02:08:56,116
never forgive me, some of them won't...

1806
02:08:58,555 --> 02:09:00,435
But at least I'm sober.

1807
02:09:03,053 --> 02:09:06,309
I thank God for that,
I’m grateful for that.

1808
02:09:09,136 --> 02:09:11,040
And this is gonna sound really stupid

1809
02:09:11,040 --> 02:09:13,672
coming from a man who’s
locked up in prison...

1810
02:09:16,084 --> 02:09:18,222
but for the first time in my life...

1811
02:09:19,732 --> 02:09:21,285
I’m free.

1812
02:09:34,824 --> 02:09:37,611
Whitaker.
You got a visitor.

1813
02:10:15,085 --> 02:10:17,416
– You have 40 minutes.
– Okay.

1814
02:10:27,888 --> 02:10:29,687
Look at you, boy.

1815
02:10:30,289 --> 02:10:31,495
How you doing?

1816
02:10:31,818 --> 02:10:33,370
– Good.
– You look good.

1817
02:10:34,676 --> 02:10:36,502
Com'on, sit down.

1818
02:10:38,172 --> 02:10:41,128
This is a surprise.
Did you get that gift I sent you?

1819
02:10:41,128 --> 02:10:41,799
– Yeah.
– Yeah?

1820
02:10:41,799 --> 02:10:43,088
– Yeah, I got it.
– You like it?

1821
02:10:43,088 --> 02:10:44,209
– Yeah.
– Good...

1822
02:10:46,658 --> 02:10:49,774
– How's your mom?
– Fine. She's alright.

1823
02:10:51,540 --> 02:10:55,405
My College counselor wanted
me to come in... interview you.

1824
02:10:56,460 --> 02:10:57,475
Me?

1825
02:10:57,475 --> 02:11:00,971
Yeah. I'm writing essays
for College applications.

1826
02:11:00,971 --> 02:11:02,154
Good.

1827
02:11:02,480 --> 02:11:03,946
I need your help.

1828
02:11:04,259 --> 02:11:05,659
So you got it.

1829
02:11:06,905 --> 02:11:11,748
And then... this essay.
The essay that I have to write...

1830
02:11:13,550 --> 02:11:19,985
it's called... “the most fascinating
person... that I’ve never met.”

1831
02:11:30,756 --> 02:11:32,434
So...

1832
02:11:36,998 --> 02:11:38,465
Who are you?

1833
02:11:47,572 --> 02:11:49,109
That's a good question.
