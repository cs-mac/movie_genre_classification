Could you tell me on your own words
what you know about that?

102
00:06:43,972 --> 00:06:46,486
Well, Heather wanted
to leave home, see,

103
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:49,222
and she'd been knocking about
with this girl with a red mini.

And we were pretty sure
she was a lesbian, like,

106
00:06:55,235 --> 00:06:58,165
so me and Rose said, "Hang on a sec,

107
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,040
you'd better think about this, girl,
you know, give it a night, at least."

108
00:07:02,075 --> 00:07:04,447
So next morning come up and...

109
00:07:05,254 --> 00:07:06,778
she looked real rough.

110
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,740
She'd been crying and...

111
00:07:09,775 --> 00:07:12,080
So Rose says, "Let her go."

112
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,434
She said, "I'll go to the bank and
draw out 600 pounds,

113
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:18,194
she can have that and go".

114
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,640
So, Rose goes off and I'm left in the
hall with Heather and her suitcase.

115
00:07:23,675 --> 00:07:27,680
She's got her hands on her hips, you
know, the big lady, like...

116
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,720
I say, "How about
you get a flat up the road?

117
00:07:32,755 --> 00:07:34,765
You can have girlfriends up there."

118
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,720
And she said, "If you don't let me
fucking go...

119
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,400
I'll give all the kids acid."

120
00:07:40,435 --> 00:07:42,165
That's LSD, like.

121
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,440
"And they'll jump off the church roof
and kill their selves."

122
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,885
And I said, "Well, that ain't very
nice, girl,

123
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,160
you threatening to do that
to your own brothers and sisters."

124
00:07:53,195 --> 00:07:56,400
And she's got this smile on her face,
like a sort of smirk,

125
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:58,885
like, "Try me and I'll do it".

126
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,420
So I just lunged at her
like that and then

127
00:08:01,455 --> 00:08:03,921
I grabbed her by the throat,
like that,

128
00:08:03,956 --> 00:08:04,956
and held her there for...

129
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,525
I don't know how long
but it was real quick because...

130
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,320
It's surprising how long you can hold
someone by the throat until they...

131
00:08:13,355 --> 00:08:15,405
until they...

132
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,022
But I can't even remember to that
extent what happened next, but

133
00:08:19,594 --> 00:08:21,240
the next minute she's gone blue.

134
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,760
And I'm looking at her from head to foot.
You know, what the heck's gone wrong?

135
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,000
I put her on the floor and I'm blowing
in her mouth, pumping her chest,

136
00:08:31,035 --> 00:08:34,017
but she kept on getting bluer
and I didn't know what to do.

137
00:08:34,052 --> 00:08:36,965
I hadn't meant to hurt her
and Rose is due back any minute.

138
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,797
I'm thinking, jeez, I've got to do
something and...

139
00:08:39,082 --> 00:08:40,286
I was scared.

140
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,840
So I was going to put her
in the Wendy house.

141
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,645
Then I thought I'd put her
in the dustbin,

142
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,564
but I couldn't get her in there, so...

143
00:08:49,351 --> 00:08:50,830
I get this ice saw.

144
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,600
You know, with the two prongs at the
top and the serrated edges,

145
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:56,255
you use them for

146
00:08:56,308 --> 00:08:57,825
cutting blocks of ice

147
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,200
and I cut her legs off, and...

148
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,906
I mean, that was...

149
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,571
unbearable.

150
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,160
Yeah, I can still hear
that in my sleep.

151
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,125
And then I cut her head off, and...
Well, I closed her eyes first, cos

152
00:09:15,952 --> 00:09:18,360
well, you're not going to take a
saw to your own daughter

153
00:09:18,395 --> 00:09:20,800
when she's sat there
looking at you, are you?

154
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,660
And then she fit
neatly in the bin, so

155
00:09:25,174 --> 00:09:28,161
I push it down the end of the garden,

156
00:09:28,196 --> 00:09:28,697
behind the Wendy House.

157
00:09:28,732 --> 00:09:30,165
Then I take her suitcase

158
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,400
and stuck it behind the vet's on St
Michael's Square where everyone
chucks their rubbish.

159
00:09:34,435 --> 00:09:37,546
Then I got Heather from behind
the Wendy house and...

160
00:09:38,124 --> 00:09:39,370
buried her.

161
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,843
And I been meaning to come down here
and get all this sorted out before,

162
00:09:44,475 --> 00:09:46,400
but I never got round to it.

163
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,680
Can I ask if the appropriate adult's
all right?

164
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,280
Oh, quite all right, thank you.

165
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,045
DC SAVAGE: Let's get this clear.

166
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,560
- You're saying you killed your
daughter. - But not intentionally.

167
00:10:04,595 --> 00:10:06,685
DC LAW: What sort of grave are we
looking for?

168
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,400
Just a hole about four foot square.
SAVAGE: And what's in this hole?

169
00:10:10,435 --> 00:10:12,845
- Well, Heather.
- How many pieces?

170
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,200
Three pieces, two legs,
a head and a body.

171
00:10:15,235 --> 00:10:16,885
LAW: That's four pieces.

172
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,040
Are you happy to come to the house
and point out where she is?

173
00:10:20,075 --> 00:10:21,445
Yeah.

174
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,920
Why didn't you tell us all this
before, Fred?

175
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,165
I wasn't ready.

176
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,920
Or is it cos we're carrying out a search
and you were afraid we might find her?

177
00:10:30,955 --> 00:10:31,981
No.

178
00:10:32,481 --> 00:10:35,846
You see, all this is causing
stress to Rose and I don't want that,

179
00:10:35,881 --> 00:10:38,520
and the thing I'd like
to make clear is that Rose,

180
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:40,640
knew nothing about any of this.

181
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,900
The time is 17:08 by my watch
and the interview is ended

182
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:51,080
whilst arrangements are made
to visit 25 Cromwell Street.

183
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,480
This notice explains
what happens to the tapes.

184
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,040
-Can I have a word?
- Yeah, sure.

185
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,000
- Is Rose here?
- No.

186
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,680
- I've a feeling she's in the building.
- She's not here.

187
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,200
I just wanted to make sure you're OK.

188
00:11:12,235 --> 00:11:14,520
Er... Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

189
00:11:14,555 --> 00:11:16,480
(SHOUTING)

190
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,040
She is here.

191
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,880
I thought they were taking her
straight to Cheltenham.

192
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,880
- This way, Mrs West.
- You're unbelievable, you lot.

193
00:11:29,915 --> 00:11:31,840
You're fucking unbelievable!

194
00:11:32,106 --> 00:11:35,880
(RINGING TONE)

195
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,765
- Hello.
- Oh, hi, love, it's me.

196
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,120
Is everything all right?
JOSH: Yeah.

197
00:11:41,155 --> 00:11:43,520
- Have you had tea?
- Sort of.

198
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,324
You might have to put Jade to bed.

199
00:11:46,989 --> 00:11:48,113
Where are you?

200
00:11:48,115 --> 00:11:50,165
I told you, I'm at the police
station.

201
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,840
I'm helping the police with an
investigation.

202
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,205
What investigation?

203
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,720
Yeah, the press office
are working on it now.

204
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,480
I can't talk about it. I'm really
sorry, love, I've got to go.

205
00:12:01,515 --> 00:12:03,440
I'll see you later, all right? Bye.

206

(FRED'S VOICE)

207

DC LAW: What, overalls?

208
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,560
FRED: Standard police issue, are
they? Nothing but the best.

209
00:12:12,595 --> 00:12:14,597
Damn stuff drive you mad, it does.

210
00:12:14,632 --> 00:12:16,600
- What's that, then?
- Fibreglass.

211
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,320
Been spraying this bloke's loft over
Stroud way.

212
00:12:20,355 --> 00:12:23,080
We don't have back-scratchers
in the station, Fred.

213
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,240
- Is the car ready?
- Don't I know you from somewhere?

214
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,800
- Erm... I'm sure you don't.
- You don't half look familiar.

LAW: I'll be in the first car with
Mr West and his solicitor Mr Ogden.

217
00:12:39,115 --> 00:12:41,480
Ain't just Heather
I buried in that garden.

218
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,520
- There's more.
- More?

219
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,445
You wouldn't believe it.

220
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,240
Not that you can let on to the
police I told you that, eh?

221
00:12:50,275 --> 00:12:52,805
You have got to keep everything I
say in confidence.

222
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,440
But you're a good appropriate adult,
you'll already know that.

223
00:12:56,475 --> 00:12:58,040
DC SAVAGE: Mrs Leach.

224
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,481
OK?

225
00:13:00,869 --> 00:13:02,075
All ready?

226
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,434
Let's go.

227
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,834
Right arm, please, Fred.

228
00:13:30,119 --> 00:13:33,039
- Where's Rose? - On her way to
Cheltenham Police Station.

229
00:13:33,074 --> 00:13:34,759
She's also under arrest.

230
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,439
- That's a waste of her time and yours.
- Come on.

231
00:14:18,439 --> 00:14:20,399
The work I put into this place!

232
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:24,079
Knocking through here
and building on there.

233
00:14:25,319 --> 00:14:27,804
Years of back-break
to get it looking tickety-boo.

234
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,999
I need to remind you you are under
caution, Fred, you understand?

235
00:14:31,639 --> 00:14:33,684
Yes, thank you, Hazel.

236
00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:36,796
Now you show us where you buried
your daughter Heather.

237
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:01,799
The problem is remembering
what you did when...

238
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,599
I'd try there.

239
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:26,719
- Is Bernard still around?
- He's gone home.

240
00:15:26,754 --> 00:15:28,719
- Get him back.
- We need a pathologist.

241
00:15:28,754 --> 00:15:30,759
See there?

242
00:15:30,794 --> 00:15:32,719
What?

243
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,199
And there?

244
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,804
What am I supposed to be looking at?

245
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,650
OK, we're going to get a forensic
team to start examining that area.

246
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:47,679
We'll go back to the station now,
apply for an extension of custody

247
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:49,724
and resume our interview tomorrow.

248
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,839
Is there anything else
you wish to say?

249
00:15:52,367 --> 00:15:54,078
Yes. Will the appropriate adult
be present?

250
00:15:55,239 --> 00:15:56,759
Can you attend?

251
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,522
Erm...

252
00:15:59,111 --> 00:16:01,514
Yeah, if you want me.

253
00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:03,444
That's sorted, then.

254
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:05,119
She's been very helpful so far.

that's not right.

What a mess,

261
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,880
I'm having to re-skim it all. I told them,
I said, "This'll take weeks."

Gloucester Police Station,
the date is 26th February 1994.

- Your full name, please.
- Frederick Walter Stephen West.

- And your legal representative...
- Howard Ogden.

271
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:03,479
- And acting as your appropriate adult...
- Janet Leach.

272
00:18:03,514 --> 00:18:06,004
I've to remind that you are still
under caution. Do you understand?

273
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:09,044
- Yes and me and him just had an
argument. - Discussion.

274
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:12,601
I'm telling you now what I just told
him. Heather is not in that garden.

275
00:18:15,399 --> 00:18:18,719
She's alive and well and possibly at
this moment in Bahrain.

276
00:18:19,719 --> 00:18:23,439
She's been recruited to work
for a drugs cartel as a drugs runner.

277
00:18:23,474 --> 00:18:25,399
They treat her like a queen.

278
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:29,119
She gets in touch now and again
to tell me she's all right.

279
00:18:29,154 --> 00:18:31,164
She's using a false name.

280
00:18:31,199 --> 00:18:34,479
I have no idea what that is
and I will not let her tell me.

that is entirely up to you.

you won't,

And I don't care how much money and
time you waste, cos you wasted mine.

285
00:18:46,994 --> 00:18:50,076
- Not just now but in the past.
- There were previous allegations.

286
00:18:50,111 --> 00:18:53,159
- There was nothing in them.
- Rape and buggery of your children.

287
00:18:53,194 --> 00:18:55,884
- Which was never proven.
- You had me in prison,

288
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,933
spat at by other prisoners,
my younger kids put into care,

where they still are, poor lambs,

00:19:00,001 --> 00:19:01,964
trying to force me to admit
that I assaulted them...

291
00:19:01,999 --> 00:19:05,599
- Trying to get to the truth, Fred.
- You turned my house upside down.

292
00:19:05,634 --> 00:19:08,519
- And we'll do so again and the garden.
- 3,000 pounds that cost me...

293
00:19:08,554 --> 00:19:11,204
And we'll keep on searching
until we find Heather.

294
00:19:11,239 --> 00:19:14,079
All because of some remark
about her being under the patio!

295
00:19:14,114 --> 00:19:16,044
A remark made by your own daughter.

296
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:18,644
-Anne Marie said it was a family joke.
- A jopke. There you are!

297
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:22,119
To social workers who, like me,
have had concerns about your family

298
00:19:22,154 --> 00:19:23,524
for a considerable time.

299
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:25,898
You're the beautifulest woman in
Gloucester when you're angry, Hazel.

300
00:19:27,274 --> 00:19:30,039
I'm just trying to get to the truth
this time, Fred.

301
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:34,084
- You're being personal and vindictive.
- I'm being neither.

302
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:35,378
Against me and my Rose,

303
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:39,840
who loves our family,
who'd do anything for them.

304
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,439
Why are you saying this now, Fred?

305
00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:46,919
Last night you took us to the house
with Mr Ogden and this lady,

306
00:19:46,954 --> 00:19:48,879
and you showed us a grave.

307
00:19:50,479 --> 00:19:52,524
You inconvenienced me.

308
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,199
So, are you trying to inconvenience
DC Savage to get back at her?

309
00:19:56,234 --> 00:19:59,199

then, Helen, I...

all in one place?

- You didn't scatter any of her body
around the garden? - No.

344

Cos they found another body part
in another part of the garden.

have got there.

What, are you suggesting
it wasn't part of Heather?

It must have been.

348
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:50,124
It was a thigh bone.

They've already found
two thigh bones.

Heather didn't have
three legs, did she?

Well... do you have any knowledge

could have got there, Fred?

she was gonna tell Rose and...

there was a bit of an argument,

00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,280
- Sorry about that.
- It's all right.

468
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,840
Look, have a seat, I'll get you a
glass of water.

469
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,200
Occupational hazard,
I'm afraid, that kind of abuse.

470
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,740
It's not that.

471
00:32:32,775 --> 00:32:34,760
What is it, then?

472
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,120
Things have happened
and been said that I hadn't expected.

473
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,880
What things?

474
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,240
Has Fred said anything privately
to you about any of this?

475
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:59,040
I can't tell you.
I owe a duty of confidence.

476
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,205
Of course.

477
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,880
But if he does try and give you
information privately,

478
00:33:06,915 --> 00:33:08,977
you can advise him to speak to me.

479
00:33:09,012 --> 00:33:11,040
I know, I've done the training.

480
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,960
You'd better get home.

481
00:33:48,608 --> 00:33:51,188
What are you doing? It's Sunday.

482
00:33:51,223 --> 00:33:53,768
I know. They need me to go in again.

483
00:33:53,803 --> 00:33:55,773
What?

484
00:33:55,808 --> 00:33:57,813
The police.

485
00:33:57,848 --> 00:33:59,808
Bloody hell, Janet.

486
00:34:01,008 --> 00:34:02,088
(PHONE RINGS)

487
00:34:08,848 --> 00:34:10,893
Hello.

488
00:34:10,928 --> 00:34:12,928
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I'm just going in now.

489
00:34:14,328 --> 00:34:16,368
Coping? Of course I'm coping.

490
00:34:16,403 --> 00:34:18,328
Who says I'm not?

491
00:34:21,048 --> 00:34:23,008
Pull out? No!

492
00:34:25,768 --> 00:34:28,608
So, you're saying if I carry on,
you won't support me?

493
00:34:30,888 --> 00:34:32,848
OK, fine!

494
00:34:40,648 --> 00:34:42,733
(CHATTER)

495
00:34:42,768 --> 00:34:46,018
I want that statement on my desk first
thing in the morning, you understand?

496
00:34:47,083 --> 00:34:48,050
Excuse me.

497
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:51,034
Can I ask? Have you said
something to her?

498
00:34:51,069 --> 00:34:52,303
What?

499
00:34:52,688 --> 00:34:55,528
The organiser of the
appropriate adult register.

500
00:34:55,563 --> 00:34:56,888
Yes, yes, I have.

501
00:34:57,648 --> 00:35:00,048
Did you tell her that
I wasn't up to this?

502
00:35:00,083 --> 00:35:01,453
No, I did not.

503
00:35:01,488 --> 00:35:04,408
Cos she rang me and asked me
if I wanted to pull out.

504
00:35:04,443 --> 00:35:07,205
I explained it was a very difficult
and distressing case.

505
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,968
She's perfectly entitled
to give you that opportunity.

506
00:35:10,003 --> 00:35:11,408
Well, I won't.

507
00:35:12,168 --> 00:35:14,728
Are you quite sure
you still feel able to carry on?

508
00:35:15,728 --> 00:35:16,910
Yeah, absolutely.

509
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,482
Very well.

510
00:35:18,568 --> 00:35:21,648
Janet! There's been a development.

511
00:35:21,683 --> 00:35:22,653
What?

512
00:35:22,688 --> 00:35:24,966
Fred's indicated that there's
another body in the garden.

513
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:28,271
- Who?
- A girl called Alison Chambers.

514
00:35:28,306 --> 00:35:30,858
I suspect he's told us
cos we'll find the body anyway.

515
00:35:31,279 --> 00:35:34,541
I want him to point out the grave.
Can you come to the house?

516
00:35:35,043 --> 00:35:36,968
Er... Yeah, of course.

517
00:35:39,728 --> 00:35:41,688
(CLANGING)

518
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:45,568
(KEYS JANGLING)

519
00:35:56,688 --> 00:36:00,288
So, here, Fred,
this here's where we found bones

520
00:36:00,323 --> 00:36:03,888
that you say may belong
to Shirley Robinson.

521
00:36:05,688 --> 00:36:07,648
Where did you bury Alison Chambers?

522
00:36:08,848 --> 00:36:10,808
Well, now...

523
00:36:11,208 --> 00:36:13,648
- Now you're asking.
- Yes, I am asking, Fred.

524
00:36:15,928 --> 00:36:17,368
Let's see.

525
00:36:37,168 --> 00:36:39,488
No. I don't think I can get it.

526
00:36:41,848 --> 00:36:43,808
Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on.

527
00:36:45,648 --> 00:36:47,608
I'm picking something up.

528
00:36:57,648 --> 00:36:59,568
- Yeah, that's her.
- Alison?

529
00:37:01,808 --> 00:37:04,088
Yeah, she's trying
to tell me something.

530
00:37:04,123 --> 00:37:06,048
What's she trying to tell you, Fred?

531
00:37:08,048 --> 00:37:10,008
Where she is, but I...

532
00:37:10,888 --> 00:37:13,888
I don't think I can understand
what she's trying to...

533
00:37:16,048 --> 00:37:18,008
Yeah, hold on, hold on. Erm...

534
00:37:36,008 --> 00:37:37,968
Yeah. Try there.

535
00:37:39,248 --> 00:37:41,408
Now that's your lot,
you'll find no more.

536
00:37:43,728 --> 00:37:44,634
What about...

537
00:37:45,582 --> 00:37:47,097
Rena?

538
00:37:48,006 --> 00:37:50,408
- Rena?
- Your first wife.

539
00:37:52,008 --> 00:37:53,568
And what about Charmaine?

540
00:37:55,488 --> 00:37:58,293
- Charmaine?
- Why are you looking at me like that?

541
00:37:58,328 --> 00:38:01,928
Rena had a daughter Charmaine,
who became your step-daughter.

542
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:05,053
Where are they?

543
00:38:05,088 --> 00:38:07,408
Well, you lose... you lose
track of people, don't you?

544
00:38:07,443 --> 00:38:09,174
You said you'd lost track of Heather,

545
00:38:09,209 --> 00:38:12,773
but you killed her
and buried her, in this garden.

546
00:38:12,808 --> 00:38:16,268
And you did the same to Shirley
Robinson and Alison Chambers.

547
00:38:16,303 --> 00:38:19,728
You won't find Rena and
Charmaine here, and that I swear.

548
00:38:21,528 --> 00:38:24,608
And even if you don't believe me,
I know the appropriate adult does,

549
00:38:24,643 --> 00:38:27,328
cos she understands me
in a way that you lot don't.

550
00:38:28,448 --> 00:38:30,493
Isn't that so?

551
00:38:30,528 --> 00:38:33,328
How could I understand you?
You've killed people.

552
00:38:34,128 --> 00:38:37,248
Because you're a woman
who can see beneath the surface.

553
00:38:37,283 --> 00:38:39,768
And a woman who knows remorse
when she sees it.

554
00:38:42,648 --> 00:38:44,608
Not like you lot.

555
00:38:45,808 --> 00:38:48,439
The police have found two more
bodies in the garden in Gloucester

556
00:38:48,474 --> 00:38:50,621
where the remains of the
missing schoolgirl Heather West

557
00:38:50,656 --> 00:38:52,102
were discovered on Saturday.

558
00:38:52,654 --> 00:38:54,495
Her father is charged
with her murder.

559
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:57,293
The two new bodies
are thought to be of adults

560
00:38:57,328 --> 00:38:59,728
but police say identification
will be difficult.

561
00:38:59,763 --> 00:39:02,093
They're checking registers of
missing people.

562
00:39:02,128 --> 00:39:04,689
Our West Of England reporter Steve
Scott has the details...

563
00:39:04,724 --> 00:39:08,248
Can I use that table?
I can't concentrate in there.

564
00:39:08,283 --> 00:39:10,293
Oh, yeah.

565
00:39:10,328 --> 00:39:13,328
..the city's biggest-ever
criminal investigation.

566
00:39:14,048 --> 00:39:16,253
Is this the thing
you're involved with?

567
00:39:16,288 --> 00:39:19,728
Forensic teams have unearthed
three sets of human remains...

568
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:23,048
It is, isn't it?

569
00:39:24,728 --> 00:39:26,648
It obviously is, Josh.

570
00:39:27,208 --> 00:39:29,168
She can't talk about it.

571
00:39:30,848 --> 00:39:32,893
Do you think there are more bodies?

572
00:39:32,928 --> 00:39:35,733
I bet there are more, though,
most people do.

573
00:39:35,768 --> 00:39:39,528
Police have confirmed the man's wife
has been released without charge.

574
00:39:39,563 --> 00:39:43,528
Indications are that the police
operation at 25 Cromwell Street

575
00:39:43,563 --> 00:39:45,488
could go on for many more days yet.

576
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,928
What's that number again, please?

577
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,853
DC SAVAGE: Jacqui will show you out.

578
00:39:55,888 --> 00:39:59,282
I know this is distressing but that
information could be really useful.

579
00:40:03,048 --> 00:40:05,368
We'll be in touch if we
have any news at all.

580
00:40:08,688 --> 00:40:10,370
- Ready for another session?
- Yeah.

581
00:40:10,828 --> 00:40:11,937
Who was that?

582
00:40:12,087 --> 00:40:13,721
Mr and Mrs Gough.

583
00:40:13,888 --> 00:40:17,328
Gloucester couple whose daughter
lodged with the Wests 20 years ago.

584
00:40:17,363 --> 00:40:20,648
We found some belongings in the
house we think may be hers.

585
00:40:20,683 --> 00:40:23,248
You think she could be
another victim? - Yup.

586
00:40:23,283 --> 00:40:24,968
Where's this going to end?

587
00:40:25,568 --> 00:40:29,008
There are three bodies and that's
it. I said I'm willing to sort all
that out.

588
00:40:29,043 --> 00:40:32,128
I know I'll never go home again
but I want my garden reinstated

589
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:33,893
and I want Rose and
the kids back home.

590
00:40:33,928 --> 00:40:36,928
- She can't go back home!
- Why not? You've released Rose.

591
00:40:36,963 --> 00:40:39,234
She's with Mae and Stephen,
the younger kids are in care.

592
00:40:39,269 --> 00:40:41,667
We're still searching the property

593
00:40:41,702 --> 00:40:44,065
and the fact that
we've released Rose

594
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:45,768
doesn't mean that
we belive she's innocent.

595
00:40:45,803 --> 00:40:47,728
This is all wrong, see.

596
00:40:50,128 --> 00:40:52,728
Did Rose know about your
relationship with Shirley Robinson?

597
00:40:52,763 --> 00:40:54,093
No, she didn't.

598
00:40:54,128 --> 00:40:57,208
Living under the same roof? Rose
must have known she was pregnant.

599
00:40:57,243 --> 00:41:00,928
- She didn't know I was the father.
- I suggest that she did.

600
00:41:02,008 --> 00:41:03,968
I suggest she was jealous.

601
00:41:05,408 --> 00:41:07,328
I suggest she helped you to kill her.

602
00:41:08,808 --> 00:41:10,585
- We've found Shirley's body, Fred.
- I know.

603
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,865
It was me who
showed you where it was.

604
00:41:12,523 --> 00:41:16,928
So, can you explain
why the baby wasn't inside her?

605
00:41:18,185 --> 00:41:19,062
What?

606
00:41:19,808 --> 00:41:23,128
The baby has not been left
intact in the abdomen.

607
00:41:41,368 --> 00:41:43,328
I need to take a break.

608
00:41:47,488 --> 00:41:50,288
DC LAW: The time is 11:45,
the interview has ended.

609
00:41:52,168 --> 00:41:54,928
- Back in a minute, Fred.
- Can you sign this off, Mrs Leach?

610
00:41:56,288 --> 00:41:59,688
I need to speak to you.
DC SAVAGE: Yes, Mr Ogden, of course.

611
00:41:59,723 --> 00:42:01,448
I need to see that report.

612
00:42:06,486 --> 00:42:08,202
That would have been Rose.

613
00:42:10,555 --> 00:42:11,727
What would?

614
00:42:13,055 --> 00:42:14,426
The baby.

615
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:23,314
Are you saying that Rose removed the
baby from Shirley's womb?

616
00:42:25,914 --> 00:42:27,062
Oh, no, no.

617
00:42:28,786 --> 00:42:31,661
No, no, Rose is a mother,
she'd never do a thing like that.

618
00:42:35,288 --> 00:42:36,888
I can't do this.

619
00:42:39,048 --> 00:42:41,008
Don't go, please.

620
00:42:42,008 --> 00:42:44,928
Give me one good reason
why I should listen to this crap.

621
00:42:44,963 --> 00:42:47,373
- I know you've suffered.
- What?

622
00:42:47,408 --> 00:42:50,158
- You don't know anything about me.

they need to know. The girls'

That's it, "approx".

669
00:46:17,182 --> 00:46:20,782
He made this admission following
a conversation with Mrs Leach.

670
00:46:22,062 --> 00:46:24,022
I also got him to draw a map.

671
00:46:24,862 --> 00:46:28,702
He said some bodies are in the garden,
some are under the cellar floor

672
00:46:28,737 --> 00:46:30,747
and there's a body in a field.

673

It's all a bit vague.
Others to be identified.

We've made a start,
trying to identify who they might be.

675

It's a huge breakthrough, sir.

676
00:46:39,302 --> 00:46:41,307
Why did he come out with all of this?

677
00:46:41,342 --> 00:46:44,902
I told him that if he didn't start
telling the truth,

678
00:46:44,937 --> 00:46:46,867
then I wouldn't help him any more.

679
00:46:46,902 --> 00:46:49,387
That could be seen as
putting him under duress.

How?

681
00:46:50,814 --> 00:46:52,422
I was just being honest

682
00:46:52,457 --> 00:46:55,481
and I told him it was you
he should tell, not me,

683
00:46:55,516 --> 00:46:59,862
because what he tells me I have
to keep in private, confidential.

684
00:46:59,897 --> 00:47:01,942
You've done exactly the right thing.

685
00:47:02,742 --> 00:47:04,787
I won't have to go to court, will I?

686
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:09,062
Oh, I doubt that very much, Mrs
Leach, you're the appropriate adult.

You're here to assist Mr West.

See, the problem I have down here,

689
00:47:21,942 --> 00:47:23,987
is the high water table.

690

No matter how much concrete you put
down, you still get seepage.

reaching out to me but...

... I'm getting the same message from
all of them.

they're better off where they are.

or there aren't.

He'd better not have come up
with those nine to impress you.

703
00:48:43,817 --> 00:48:46,819

- Be wary of getting pally with him.

704
00:48:46,854 --> 00:48:49,822
I'm not getting pally with him,
I'm just trying to help.

Dig the floor up. Take the house
apart brick by brick if you have to.

706

- How much was it?

780
00:54:08,102 --> 00:54:09,694
It's just immaculate.

781
00:54:09,711 --> 00:54:12,714
The bloke I bought it from,
he's a Jag specialist.

782
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:14,102
How much was it?

783
00:54:15,142 --> 00:54:17,827
- Nine grand.
- 9,000?

784
00:54:17,862 --> 00:54:20,262
You can't spend
that kind of money on a car.

785
00:54:20,297 --> 00:54:22,307
It's fine, I got it on HP.

786
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:25,827
We don't even need another car.
What is going on in here?

787
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:29,862
We've got a new TV and a new video,
too. Even better deal than the car.

788
00:54:30,342 --> 00:54:33,638
I got this new unit to put them on, but
they haven't supplied enough fixings...

789
00:54:33,673 --> 00:54:36,742
Mike, Mike, this is ridiculous,
we're...

790
00:54:36,777 --> 00:54:38,307
- Mike, Mike!
- What?

791
00:54:38,342 --> 00:54:40,862
We're not getting
a new TV or a new car.

792
00:54:40,897 --> 00:54:43,079
Have you been taking your lithium?

793
00:54:43,114 --> 00:54:45,262
- Yeah, of course, yeah.
- Are you sure?

794
00:54:51,022 --> 00:54:53,467
No, you haven't,
you've been missing days.

795
00:54:53,502 --> 00:54:55,258
You can't afford to miss
any days, you know that.

796
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:57,962
Right, kids, upstairs. Go on. Go!

797
00:55:01,942 --> 00:55:05,622
Mike, the car is going back,
and the TV and the video.

798
00:55:05,657 --> 00:55:07,867
- Why?
- Just sit down. Just sit down.

799
00:55:07,902 --> 00:55:10,462
- No. Why?
Just sit down, go and sit down.

800
00:55:10,497 --> 00:55:12,422
Come on, love.

801
00:55:12,822 --> 00:55:14,782
Come on.

802
00:55:20,502 --> 00:55:23,002
I'm going to have to get you into
the hospital.

803
00:55:23,037 --> 00:55:25,502
I'm going to go and
call them now, all right?

804
00:55:29,062 --> 00:55:31,462
- I warned you.
- Just stay out of this, Josh.

805
00:55:31,942 --> 00:55:34,982
None of this would have happened
if you'd been thinking of us.

806
00:55:36,862 --> 00:55:39,222
You'd far rather spend time
with that murderer.

807
00:55:39,257 --> 00:55:41,182
Just leave it, will you, Josh?

808
00:55:45,502 --> 00:55:49,587
Oh, hello, yeah, my name's Janet Leach
and I'm calling about my partner.

809
00:55:49,622 --> 00:55:54,022
Yeah, he's bi-polar and he's going into
a high and I need to bring him in urgently.

810
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:13,912
He's finally dropped off.

811
00:56:17,032 --> 00:56:19,752
He's clearly got very
over-stimulated, though.

812
00:56:21,032 --> 00:56:25,152
It could take days, maybe weeks,
to get him fully stabilised again.

813
00:56:26,232 --> 00:56:27,290
I see.

814
00:56:28,144 --> 00:56:30,918
- Do you need me to stay?
- No.

815
00:56:31,312 --> 00:56:34,992
Would it be all right if I came back
this afternoon about half-four?

816
00:56:35,027 --> 00:56:36,432
Fine.

817
00:56:44,872 --> 00:56:48,085
(ON TAPE) ROSE: I'm admitting nothing
cos I've got fucking nothing to admit.

818
00:56:48,201 --> 00:56:51,592
MAE: So it's all Dad.
That's what I'm saying, Mae.

819
00:56:51,627 --> 00:56:53,637
I'm as shocked about this as you are.

820
00:56:53,672 --> 00:56:56,597
DC LAW: Rose has denied it to us,
and to her daughter.

821
00:56:56,632 --> 00:57:00,032
We've got nothing else on her.
So, unless Fred drops her in it...

822
00:57:00,067 --> 00:57:00,992
Janet.

823
00:57:02,312 --> 00:57:05,717
- Ready to crack on?
- Yeah, but erm...

824
00:57:05,752 --> 00:57:09,192
- I need to leave at four, I've got
an urgent family matter. - That's Fine.

825
00:57:13,112 --> 00:57:16,672
Did you engage them in
sadomasochistic acts?

826
00:57:16,707 --> 00:57:18,689
They were adventurous young girls.

827
00:57:18,724 --> 00:57:20,672
So, how did you end up killing them?

828
00:57:21,632 --> 00:57:23,517
You even got the killing wrong.

829
00:57:23,552 --> 00:57:27,272
You're trying to make out that I just
went out and blatantly killed people.

830
00:57:27,307 --> 00:57:30,209
It weren't like that.
Enjoyment turned to disaster.

831
00:57:30,244 --> 00:57:33,112
We're all having difficulty
understanding this.

832
00:57:33,672 --> 00:57:40,632
Especially how these things can have
gone on without Rose's knowledge.

833
00:57:40,667 --> 00:57:43,072
- Rose was out.
- Out where?

834
00:57:43,107 --> 00:57:44,712
Shopping.

835
00:57:45,392 --> 00:57:47,672
Whilst you had sex,
murdered and buried them?

836
00:57:47,707 --> 00:57:49,952
She must have had
an awful lot of shopping to do!

837
00:57:49,987 --> 00:57:52,232
She does.
It's a fair old walk to Tesco.

838
00:57:56,112 --> 00:57:58,112
Mary Bastholme.

839
00:57:58,147 --> 00:58:00,112
Carol Cooper.

840
00:58:00,872 --> 00:58:02,632
Lucy Partington.

841
00:58:04,192 --> 00:58:05,717
Shirley Hubbard.

842
00:58:05,752 --> 00:58:07,637
Those women didn't
stay at your house.

843
00:58:07,672 --> 00:58:09,569
I don't believe they were
known to you,

844
00:58:09,604 --> 00:58:11,466
they just disappeared
from local bus stops.

845
00:58:11,872 --> 00:58:13,917
(INTERROGATION FADES OUT)

846
00:58:13,952 --> 00:58:16,592
- Do you know where you were, then?
- One more time...

847
00:58:16,627 --> 00:58:18,992
Did Rose know about
these sexual encounters?

848
00:58:19,712 --> 00:58:21,272
Did she participate in them?

849
00:58:22,952 --> 00:58:26,272
- Did Rose kill Charmaine?
- Rose didn't kill no-one.

850
00:58:27,352 --> 00:58:30,392
I killed Charmaine when
I come out of Leyhill Prison.

851
00:58:30,427 --> 00:58:32,952
For the last time,
Rose had no part of this.

852
00:58:32,987 --> 00:58:34,912
Your loyalty's very touching.

853
00:58:36,592 --> 00:58:38,792
Do you think she feels
the same about you?

854
00:58:40,632 --> 00:58:42,357
- Rose loves me.
- You're so confident about that

855
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:44,089
you didn't mind her
having sex with other men?

856
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,302
- That's correct.
- So long as you knew about it.

857
00:58:46,676 --> 00:58:50,552
- I always knew about it. - So you knew
she was seeing male clients

858
00:58:50,587 --> 00:58:52,432
at another premises in Gloucester?

859
00:58:53,272 --> 00:58:55,192
- What?
- 22 Sunderland Street.

860
00:58:59,032 --> 00:59:02,952
- That's rubbish! - We spoke to men
who met her there for sex.

861
00:59:02,987 --> 00:59:04,912
Do you find that upsetting, Fred?

862
00:59:06,232 --> 00:59:09,992
There were things in Rose's life
you didn't know about.

863
00:59:11,432 --> 00:59:14,010
Sexual relationships
she kept to herself.

864
00:59:14,306 --> 00:59:16,869
- No, I don't, cos you're making it up.
- No, I'm not Fred.

865
00:59:17,027 --> 00:59:18,952
I bloody well know you are!

866
00:59:22,992 --> 00:59:24,992
Rose is all mine,
she always has been.

867
00:59:25,672 --> 00:59:28,592
And I would know,
I'd know here if that ever changed.

868
00:59:31,072 --> 00:59:34,792
Rose is my love, that was she is, and
I ain't having you lot telling me otherwise.

869
00:59:34,827 --> 00:59:38,232
- Sit down, please, Fred.
- Fred, you're not helping yourself.

870
00:59:47,032 --> 00:59:50,272
The interview is ended
at 15:47 by my watch.

871
00:59:52,712 --> 00:59:56,992
This suggestion that Rose West was
seeing men without Mr West's knowledge,

872
00:59:57,027 --> 00:59:58,682
any further disclosure about that?

873
00:59:58,717 --> 01:00:02,472
- You'd better come to the office.
- I want to be giving the correct advice.

874
01:00:02,507 --> 01:00:04,392
- Don't rush off, Janet.
- I have to.

875
01:00:06,152 --> 01:00:09,272
That's bullshit about Rose seeing other
fellas in some place I don't know about.

876
01:00:09,307 --> 01:00:11,592
I'm afraid I can't stay
and discuss it now.

877
01:00:13,712 --> 01:00:15,952
A man needs to know
his wife has no secrets.

878
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:18,157
Would you keep secrets
from your husband?

879
01:00:18,192 --> 01:00:21,272
- I'm not married. - There's
a lucky fella in your life. I can tell.

880
01:00:21,307 --> 01:00:24,352
- Mind your own bloody business.
- Please don't go. Please.

881
01:00:25,792 --> 01:00:28,792
There's something I want to tell you.
It's about Rose.

882
01:00:30,632 --> 01:00:32,592
What about her?

883
01:00:33,792 --> 01:00:35,752
She was involved.

884
01:00:49,112 --> 01:00:50,792
In how many of them?

885
01:00:50,827 --> 01:00:52,312
Lots.

886
01:00:54,472 --> 01:00:58,272
The things I could tell you about
what she done to some of them girls.

887
01:00:58,307 --> 01:01:00,232
I may have started it, but...

888
01:01:02,192 --> 01:01:04,632
..she took over
and did whatever she liked.

889
01:01:06,392 --> 01:01:10,312
I mean it. She did took that baby
out of Shirley's body, not me.

890
01:01:12,152 --> 01:01:13,501
That's the kind of woman she is.

891
01:01:14,232 --> 01:01:17,290
If all that is true, how can you
hold that back from the police?

892
01:01:17,325 --> 01:01:18,478
For the sake of the family.

893
01:01:18,952 --> 01:01:20,461
I don't understand.

894
01:01:20,619 --> 01:01:24,232
We made a pact, see, that I would
take all the blame to myself.

895
01:01:25,272 --> 01:01:27,552
On the day the police
come with the warrant,

896
01:01:27,587 --> 01:01:29,557
I was out, Rose called me to warn me.

897
01:01:29,592 --> 01:01:33,112
When I got home, the police give us
five minutes alone and we agreed then

898
01:01:33,147 --> 01:01:35,197
that I'd tell them it was all me.

899
01:01:35,232 --> 01:01:36,267
And I know you think it's wrong

900
01:01:36,302 --> 01:01:39,628
that Rose gets away with it
and I pay the price, but

901
01:01:40,072 --> 01:01:41,677
that's the plan we made.

902
01:01:41,712 --> 01:01:45,312
So she could look after the family
and that plan is working, Anna.

903
01:01:46,672 --> 01:01:49,712
- Why did you just call me Anna?
- Sorry. Janet.

904
01:01:52,592 --> 01:01:54,597
I get confused.

905
01:01:54,632 --> 01:01:56,592
My mind's spinning with all this...

906
01:01:58,392 --> 01:02:00,352
I'm losing everything.

907
01:02:01,432 --> 01:02:02,694
my family, my wife...

908
01:02:02,986 --> 01:02:03,917
home.

909
01:02:06,153 --> 01:02:07,245
And you,

910
01:02:07,698 --> 01:02:10,894
you're helping me through
the most terrible time in my life.

911
01:02:11,872 --> 01:02:13,392
You're my only friend.

912
01:02:14,912 --> 01:02:16,832
- I'm not your friend, Fred.
- You are.

913
01:02:19,392 --> 01:02:21,632
We're going on
a journey together, Janet.

914
01:02:23,552 --> 01:02:26,272
Neither of us knows
where it's going to end but...

915
01:02:27,552 --> 01:02:29,512
... we're on it together.

916
01:02:41,152 --> 01:02:42,474
I have to go.

917
01:02:50,026 --> 01:02:51,110
Mrs Leach.

918
01:02:51,586 --> 01:02:52,470
Yeah?

919
01:02:53,472 --> 01:02:55,512
We won't be needing you any more.

920
01:02:55,547 --> 01:02:56,837
What?

921
01:02:56,872 --> 01:02:59,792
Your services on the inquiry
are no longer required.

922
01:03:00,512 --> 01:03:02,752
- Why?
- I'm not obliged to give reasons.

923
01:03:03,872 --> 01:03:06,632
You can't just drop me
without any explanation.

924
01:03:06,667 --> 01:03:08,992
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't, not now.

925
01:03:12,712 --> 01:03:14,272
What do you mean, not now?

926
01:03:15,352 --> 01:03:17,437
I can't answer that.

927
01:03:17,472 --> 01:03:19,977
Well, clearly you found
all this very distressing but

928
01:03:20,012 --> 01:03:21,514
thank you for your help.

929
01:03:52,232 --> 01:03:55,202
I tell you, I'm sick of this, the
fucking trouble your father caused me

930
01:03:55,237 --> 01:03:58,182
and those fucking police,
yammering on at me.

931
01:03:58,217 --> 01:04:01,501
What I done when, what your dad done
when, who stayed in the fucking house.

932
01:04:01,536 --> 01:04:05,112
Well, I'm not taking the blame
for fucking nothing.

933
01:04:06,712 --> 01:04:10,472
What you believe don't matter, Hazel.
It's what you can prove that matters.

934
01:04:10,507 --> 01:04:12,752
(SHOUTING)
I need you, Janet. Please.

935
01:04:12,787 --> 01:04:14,792
I thought I'd frightened you off.

936
01:04:14,827 --> 01:04:16,597
What are you doing?

937
01:04:16,632 --> 01:04:19,832
I get the feeling that there's more
that he wants to tell me.

938
01:04:19,867 --> 01:04:21,877
I think there are more bodies.

939
01:04:21,912 --> 01:04:24,432
I didn't kill Anna.
Believe me, Janet.

940
01:04:24,557 --> 01:04:26,347
She guided me through you.

941
01:04:26,655 --> 01:04:28,514
I don't know what
you're talking about.

942
01:04:32,472 --> 01:04:36,192
- Rose isn't even here.
- No, but she's in here. She's in here.

943
01:04:36,227 --> 01:04:38,152
For your own peace of mind, stop.

944
01:04:39,552 --> 01:04:41,512
I can't.
