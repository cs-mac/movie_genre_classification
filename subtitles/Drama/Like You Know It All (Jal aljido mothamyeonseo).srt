1
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,740
That's him!

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,610
What do you mean?

3
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:14,940
what do you mean with him?

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,610
Who? Him? Joon Hee?

5
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:18,140
You! Don't just keep silent!

6
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,150
Let's her hand go!

7
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:28,890
Hey!

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,360
Get out!!

9
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,030
What's going on?

10
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:41,830
Why?

11
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:42,970
Omo! Omo! Omo!

12
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:44,840
- You still don't want to let go?
- Hey! Seo Joon Hee!

13
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,840
- Hey!
- Ohmygosh! What's this?

14
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:48,740
What's happen?

15
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,580
What's going on?
-= Episode 3 =-

16
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,140
What do you want a$$hole!
-= Episode 3 =-

17
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:51,510
What do you want a$$hole!

18
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,240
Shut up!

19
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,850
- Why do act like that?
- Shut up!

20
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,580
What's happen with you actually?

21
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:57,050
Let's talk outside!

22
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,320
Hyeong, do you know him?

23
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,260
Where do you know him?

24
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,720
He's my friend.

25
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,390
What? Friend?

26
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,260
So you're much younger than me.

27
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,730
Oh, you're so young.
What are you looking at?

28
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:16,140
I won't just let him go today.

29
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:17,870
What's actually happening?

30
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,210
Why are you like this?

31
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:22,270
Hey, what's going on?

32
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:23,540
I'll explain later.

33
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:24,540
Shit.

34
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,220
- Nothing?
- Nothing.

35
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:36,490
Where are they going?
They're not outside too.

36
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,820
What's actually going on?

37
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,830
I'll tell you later.

38
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:42,560
Why should...

39
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,760
Tsk, really!

40
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,100
Don't clean it up.
Just go into your room and change your clothes.

41
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,370
You're coming out with this kind of style
is weird enough.

42
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:54,710
Doing a thing that you never did.

43
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,970
Aigoo, really....

44
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,780
What's going on?
Explain it hurry!

45
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,320
You need to explain even you want to punch each other.

46
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,790
hat's happen with both of you?

47
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,450
<i>Ahhh i'm going crazy.</i>

48
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,590
Hey, ai'm gointg crazy too.

49
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,660
Jin Ah tell me that she like him.

50
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,130
The person she likes is here.

51
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,730
What?

52
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,460
Hyeong, he's my friend.

53
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,400
I'm also surprised.

54
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,800
Hey, what does it means?

55
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,400
<i>Don't just stay silent you bastard!</i>

56
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,870
I already warned you to get lost that day, right?

57
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:31,680
Are you Yoon Jin Ah's stalker?

58
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,350
Are you tired of your life already?

59
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,610
Bastard!

60
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,820
What did you say?

61
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,490
Hyeong what? Stalker?

62
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,760
This bastard dated two girls at one time.

63
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:51,230
Therefore she broke up with him.

64
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,970
He's a bastard!

65
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,840
- Hyeong, did you cheat?
- No, no.

66
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,510
This is...

67
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:04,440
It's not only me who's cheating.
Jin Ah is also having an affair, with him.

68
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,840
I've said it already, right?

69
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,780
She even told your parents
that she like him.

70
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,110
She said that just now.

71
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,190
Go away!

72
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,120
Seung Ho...

73
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,260
I told you to go!

74
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,390
Before my friend ... not ...
Before I kill you you better go away.

75
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:22,730
You didn't hear it?

76
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,730
You bastard! I told you to go!

77
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,070
You do not believe me?

78
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,140
Okay, just look at it later.

79
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,540
One day you will be sorry 
because of this bastard.

80
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,350
<i>That stupid Yoon Jin Ah, really</i>

81
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,030
Hey, since when did you know?

82
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,090
You should told me if you knew it already.

83
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:59,160
The way you talk sounds like
you really care about your Sis.

84
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,170
Shit!

85
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,240
If only I knew it earlier,
I'll throw him down.

86
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,440
Don't butt in!

87
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,310
By seeing it you should know.

88
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,180
Ahh.. i'm going crazy.

89
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,320
Yoon Jin Ah said that she likes you.

90
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,180
His mind is crazy or what?

91
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,340
<i>What happened?</i>

92
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,740
<i>Did you guys fight?</i>

93
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:46,350
Lee Gyoo Min is cheating.

94
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,350
Then?

95
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,880
Do not talk about it first.
Joon Hee you why--

96
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,820
Mom!

97
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,220
Because Lee Gyoo Min is always bothering me,

98
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,490
I ask Joon Hee for help

99
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:00,960
pretends to be my boyfriend
to get rid of it.

100
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,160
Why did you say that you like him or what?

101
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,760
I just talk whatever

102
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,630
To get rid of him.

103
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,830
At least listen to my explanations first.

104
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,640
That's because you always talk nonsense.

105
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,040
You know how shocked I am?

106
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,110
Why did you angry to the kids?

107
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,240
The one is wrong is someone else.

108
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,850
Nonetheless thank you, Joon Hee.

109
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,710
It is okay.

110
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,380
Sorry for creating trouble.

111
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,450
<i>You don't have to be sorry.</i>

112
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:28,320
<i>We are the one who should be sorry</i>

113
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,720
Yoon Jin Ah you're really embarrassing!

114
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,730
How old are you to be cheated.

115
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,130
Do not date again next time

116
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,460
<i>Ah you're noisy!</i>

117
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,930
<i>Time to eat.</i>

118
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,470
No.

119
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,070
I'll be back
later when the atmosphere is calmer.

120
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,300
Come here!

121
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,300
Tell me everything!

122
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,100
Is it true that Gyoo Min cheating?

123
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,040
You're not really like Joon He, are you?

124
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,570
Mom, what do you mean?

125
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,380
Aigoo, don't you feel ashamed in front of
Jun Hee?

126
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,110
He is your brother's best friend.

127
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,710
What will other people think?

128
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,710
You ruin your own relationship.

129
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:29,980
Surely people will think like that.

130
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,650
What about Seung Ho?

131
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,050
His friend had to intervene.

132
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,520
You're not embarrassed?

133
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,390
Why are you so useless?

134
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,060
So why did you invite him without I asked?

135
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,660
Why ask Lee Gyoo Min to come here?

136
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,260
Want it thirty or twenty one
I was always told to get married.

137
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,270
Do you think marriage is a kids play?

138
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,130
You still have another reason?

139
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,670
If you're good enough,
how could Gyoo Min do this?

140
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,010
How many time did i tell you?

141
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:57,540
Mom!

142
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,480
Aigoo, you're the only one left in our neighborhood.

143
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,880
Other's daughter
is already married.

144
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,020
Once when the time comes they date 
and then get married.

145
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,750
Where is the problem?

146
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,020
You're old
but why not get married too?

147
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:11,160
Because I'm not that great
like other's daughter.

148
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,020
Because I am your daughter
that's why I'm so useless.

149
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,290
This girl...

150
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,030
Stop it!

151
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:50,200
I'm here to get a beer.
It turns out that the owner is at home.

152
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,540
Looks like you're a bit depressed.

153
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,600
Who are you fighting with?

154
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,010
I'm a little tired.

155
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,010
I'm right.

156
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,410
A good person like you
rarely get mad.

157
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,680
Is it exciting fighting each other?

158
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:09,080
I'll take a bath first.

159
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,480
- Want to have a beer?
- Nope..

160
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,750
It looks like a real fight.

161
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:20,690
It's up to her want to marry or
want to become old just like that.

162
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:21,830
I do not want to know anymore!

163
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,760
Is it my fault?

164
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,500
I say like so for the sake of other people?

165
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,100
It's all for her.

166
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,300
Get some sleep.

167
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,370
How can I sleep now?

168
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,300
How could I sleep, my heart is burning!

169
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,510
Jin Ah will do it better next time.

170
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,250
You too!
You're not good at anything

171
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,710
Never fought anything.
Indifferent.

172
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:45,920
In the new office your rank rose to the leader
then left immediately.

173
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,520
Uh, why do you have to bring up
this problem again?

174
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,520
Why can't I?

175
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,330
If you stay longer in that possition,

176
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:56,190
how could something like this happen Jin Ah?

177
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:59,660
It's all because other people underestimate us.

178
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,420
Sorry.

179
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,490
No need to apologize to me.

180
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:28,030
You guys are not fighting out there, are you?

181
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,630
Joon Hee was about to hit him.

182
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,700
He hit him?

183
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,770
Almost.

184
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,310
If you want to find a substitute boyfriend 
at least find someone more appropriate.

185
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:43,110
Lee Gyoo Min does not flinch because he's my friend.

186
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,580
Your brain is a little slow huh?

187
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:50,120
Then... what did you talk about outside?

188
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:51,650
What talk..

189
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:54,120
I told him that he have to go before
me and Joon Hee start to punch him.

190
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,060
Why is your life so great?

191
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:03,060
I've scolded enough.

192
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,400
Now you want to scold me too?

193
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,360
It's late, why are you here?

194
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:42,890
Because of the smell of alcohol,
so i'm here.

195
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:43,830
It turns out...

196
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,360
You...

197
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,830
But why did you know...

198
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,570
Ah, you didn't find me so you're going up here?

199
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,640
Yes, i rang your door but no answer.

200
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,440
I knew it you're here.

201
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,370
I'm here stealing the beer.

202
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:59,180
Come on! Where's Joon Hee?

203
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,850
He's home since before.

204
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,510
But went out again

205
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:03,776

I'm really bored.
You're my savior.

251
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,080
Where did Joon Hee go?

252
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,220
Dunno.

253
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,420
Seems like he had a fight with someone.

254
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,090
He's so emotional when reached home.

255
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,900
He didn't answer when i ask.

256
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,960
He refused when i ask to have a drink too.

257
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:56,230
He's fine from the outside
but i don't think so for his mind.

258
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,970
Maybe his heart is stuffy.
Seems like he's upset

259
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,710
Maybe it's too stuffy so he went outside.

260
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:07,580
Honestly, when Joon Hee's mood is bad
i also become a bit awry.

261
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:12,380
As a man, he has no father figure
or brothers as a place to complain on.

262
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:15,850
Also do not have a mother who
standing by his side.

263
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,520
It's me only.

264
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,060
My ability is very limited.

265
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,460
That's why sometimes these days
I like to scold him.

266
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:27,800
Looks like you're here not for a drink.

267
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,870
W--Why?
Here I drink again!

268
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:31,470
Let's drink!

269
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:33,200
Why are there so many problems?

270
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,140
Tell me, quick.

271
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:39,940
This girl has no problem whatsoever.

272
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,880
Come on!

273
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,150
- Just sleep here then go home.
- Hmm.

274
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,560
That happy?

275
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Still alive?

276
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:41,670
#*&$%# Really...!

277
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,210
Why?

278
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,680
Just kidding!
Why are you so angry?

279
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,420
Have a taste.

280
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:56,020
This is a new product.

281
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,560
You come to work so early?

282
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,630
Yes, pretty early.

283
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,030
Last night...

284
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,500
Really, thank you very much...

285
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,770
So unexpected.

286
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:16,240
I thought I was going to be scold because of
make a scene.

287
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,580
What?

288
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,180
It's late!

289
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:19,910
Go in.

290
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,670
What do you mean just now?

291
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:52,340
Why do you think I will get angry?

292
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,950
Well...

293
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:58,280
I messed up your plan to be back together with your ex.

294
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,490
Do you think I'm trying to get back with him?

295
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,220
If not, how could you
dress up excitedly?

296
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,760
Then invite him to your house?

297
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,760
yeah, right.

298
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,370
I did that, ofc you could missunderstand.

299
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,770
But...

300
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,700
That's because there's other reason.

301
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,970
Of course there is.

302
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,840
It was not me who invite him to the house.

303
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,110
According to your logic, does this make sense?

304
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:29,980
Is it possible for me to do that?

305
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,520
No matter who invited him,

306
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,120
if your attitude is firm,

307
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,120
No matter who invited him
he will not come.

308
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,520
That's common sense.

309
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,660
Nothing else, is it?

310
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,400
I went down first.

311
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,420
Deputy Yoon, come here for a while!

312
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,230
What happened to that store in Gasan?


313
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,630
I'm asked you to take care of it.

314
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:22,970
You instead create a content certificate?

315
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:25,770
Do you know how Isa-nim scold me?

316
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,510
Is this how you work?

317
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:30,980
What have you done?

318
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,780
The store owner in Gasan comes to the headquarters.

319
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:37,050
Why are you still standing here?

320
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:37,780
Solve this problem immediately !

321
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,980
If you can not fix this problem,

322
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,720
we will all be fired.
All of us!

323
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,990
Just because of you Deputy Yoon.

324
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,030
May I come in?

325
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:21,690
Hmm.

326
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,970
You go in first.

327
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,510
You sit here.

328
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,920
Okay.

329
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,190
Are you okay?

330
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:48,050
Yes.

331
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:39,170
I do it this because
I have no other way.

332
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,970
The head office did not give me any more discounts.

333
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:45,380
I was told the i can't sell milk again?

334
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,710
You think based on you logic,
Does this make sense?

335
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,720
What kind of logic is that?

336
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,520
Ah!

337
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,050
Sorry.

338
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:58,860
I'm really depressed.

339
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,660
Therefore...

340
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,800
Certificate of content you send,

341
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,930
that means you will fight till the end, right?

342
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,130
Ahh.. even rabbits will bite when it's frightened.

343
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,670
I can not always be passive
and accept all requirements.

344
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,140
Of course.

345
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:17,340
If it always like that, then I can not live.

346
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,140
Right.

347
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:22,880
Then fight till the end.

348
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,550
Try keep walking till the end.

349
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,420
If every day just act half hearted,

350
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,820
better not doing it at all.
It's also inappropriate.

351
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,820
Yes, right?

352
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,960
This is something that should not be
spoken by people from headquarters.

353
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:38,560
I'm planning to resign.

354
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,500
I can not keep on with this job anymore.

355
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:47,240
Always sandwiched between companies
with the franchisor.

356
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,840
I'm also pretty sick of it.

357
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,780
You are likely to
take the legal route, right?

358
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:58,850
f necessary I can testify for you.

359
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:03,450
Uhm ... you will resign?

360
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:05,520
Then what do you plan to do?

361
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:08,330
I never told you huh?

362
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:11,530
My father is retired and always travelling.

363
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,600
I plan to go with him.

364
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,600
Do you want to come with us?

365
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,620
Just pulled the collar,
why are you sick already?

366
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,020
Wake up for a while.

367
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:38,020
Aigoo, aigoo...

368
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,030
Let me see.

369
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:48,770
Aigoo...

370
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:52,440
You're old.

371
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,040
That's why you're always so careless

372
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,380
What to do?

373
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:03,250
You eat the meds i bought first.

374
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,580
Then just sleep again,
maybe able to recover soon.

375
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,650
You need to eat rice first.

376
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:11,120
Standing may be difficult for you.

377
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,720
You better keep seated.

378
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,730
I'll cook for you.

379
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:17,600
Maybe it would be better to eat porridge?

380
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,530
You really have done a big thing,
big things.

381
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:40,550
Hyeong Jeong?

382
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:41,150
Yes?

383
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,350
Have you check the service desk?

384
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,950
- Yes, I checked it just now.
- Welcome.

385
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:45,490
Hello!

386
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:46,960
Hello, what kind of drink do you want?

387
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,560
I am from head office.

388
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,030
My name is Kang Se Yeong.

389
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,770
Are you Jeonju?
[Jeonju - franchise shop owner]

390
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:56,970
Yes.

391
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,500
What do you need?

392
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,040
No, nothing.

393
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,240
I happen to be passing by so 
i just want to greet you.

394
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:08,850
I heard that you're 
Deputy Yoon Jin Ah's friend.

395
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:09,710
Yes.

396
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,380
I heard alot about you from her.

397
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:16,720
Then you are Seo Joon Hee's sister?

398
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,720
Yes.

399
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:23,390
I've met him once
through Deputy Yoon Jin Ah.

400
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,200
Ah, so it's like that.

401
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,470
Since you're here,
want a cup of coffee?

402
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,730
May be inspection too?

403
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:33,140
You are very humorous.

404
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:38,010
Of course, I want.
But the coffee is on my personal expenses please.

405
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:43,150
The coffee ... maybe next time?

406
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:57,160
All of the total sales
must be returned to the head office.

407
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:02,900
The rest will be returned.
Must contact the recycling plant.

408
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,770
Wonder!
Why the hell you people really impatient?

409
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:12,240
Uhm... of course it must be stopped immediately.
You can save little by little.

410
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,450
This is for your sake.

411
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:20,250
What did I say?
Of course I am very happy it's for the sake of me.

412
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,590
Just say it.
Why is it so extreme?

413
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,990
Really!

414
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,730
Because my life is meaningless.

415
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:42,140
Life is ... why it's so complicated?

416
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:47,880
Stop! Your life is still long.
What are you talking about?

417
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,880
Do you think that being young will ensure
that everything will go smoothly?

418
00:24:55,420 --> 00:25:03,960
Betrayed, hurt and then looking
consolation somewhere.

419
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:10,170
Trying to collect the passion
and then feel frustrated again.

420
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:17,640
Even so, never stop looking for hope
and trying climbing up with all of your might.

421
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:23,650
Everything is like this.
Exactly the same way of thinking.

422
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,120
<i>I know, it's all for the sake of living.</i>

423
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:34,120
<i>Be strong!</i>

424
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:41,670
Be strong!

425
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,940
You're going to stay up again tonight?

426
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,810
Why you're so dedicated suddenly?

427
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:57,410
I'm like this from the beginning!

428
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:58,150
Hello!

429
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,750
You're not full team today?

430
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:04,150
Oh, Deputy Yoon Daeri is around here
soon--

431
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:05,560
She went on a date.

432
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:07,960
<i>That's not ossible.</i>

433
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,030
I'm witness it.
I saw his boyfriend.

434
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:14,030
Oh Jeon Hee, I went to your sister's store.

435
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,430
Ah, yes..

436
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:19,100
Then one person goes on a date,
where are the remaining three will be going?

437
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,840
Of course going home.

438
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,440
I still don't know yet.

439
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,240
<i>I thought you have a plan.</i>

440
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,510
Just about to make a plan.

441
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:29,710
Joon Hee, when are we going to have fun
in an exciting nightclub?

442
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,250
Now is okay.

443
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:37,390
Hey, you stay up late ... 
Apparently you mean going to stay up like this.

444
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:38,320
I'll take my bag first.

445
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,120
Me too.

446
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:42,260
Are we seriously going to a club?
My dress is not quite right!

447
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,460
If I knew it I'll  wear a sparkly shirt.

448
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,460
You pretty familiar with a club!

449
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:49,870
Deputy Geum...
You do not want to come, do you?

450
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:52,940
Just follow us! Just look around
like me.

451
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:55,410
Okay, if so...

452
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:03,680
What did you say? Yoon Jin Ah has another man?
Are you kidding me?

453
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:09,350
I've seen it several times.
Don't you know it?

454
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:13,220
If so, now way i don't know it?

455
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:16,560
But since I do not know,
it means nothing.

456
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,960
Then it means she lied.

457
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,830
Hey!

458
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:33,240
I saw him at her home.
In front of her parents.

459
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,510
She said it was the man she liked.

460
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,050
Hey, but do you know what's more silly?

461
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:50,330
That's he's Seung Ho's friend.
His brother's friend.

462
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:53,460
You ... do you mean the one in front of the office building?

463
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,330
The man who brought Jin Ah away?

464
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:59,270
<i>Uhh! You know it right?
Why did you tell me that you don't know?</i>

465
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,940
Hey, this moron do you asked to be beat?

466
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:13,150
How could he knew our meeting place?

467
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:17,350
Is there any other place around your shop
besides this one?

468
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:18,290
<i>Ah!</i>

469
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:23,090
Kyeong Seon, please go out now.

470
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,980
Your mood is like you're going to war too today.

471
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:41,380
Where did you fight before you come here?

472
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:44,250
People who provoked me is
not just one or two.

473
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:48,990
Pathetic.
But he's really stupid.

474
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:50,850
He thought there was something between
you and Joon Hee.

475
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:54,390
He said he met him at youre house.
Why did you not tell me?

476
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:58,530
Oh, I plan to tell you later.

477
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:02,200
Because i even feel annoyed to tell
you the story.
How annoying.

478
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,730
Is there such a situation?

479
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:08,870
I'm totally lazy to bring it up about that person  
that's why I disn't tell you.

480
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:14,550
Yeah, I know what you mean.
But can you do it well?

481
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:17,280
If not, i have to die.

482
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,480
If it's like this I trust you.

483
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,020
I hope you keep the fighting.

484
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:31,360
-= Ye Eun =-

485
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:31,400
-= Ye Eun =-
-= Deputy, come here! =-

486
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,360
 -= Deputy, come here! =-

487
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,580
Hey, Lee Gyoo Min!

488
00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:55,780
Where are you going? My house?
Are you crazy?

489
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,850
I'm not crazy ... I'm being blamed.

490
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:01,720
I'm the only one who is considered as a trash.
I'm going crazy.

491
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,060
I want to meet your parents.
I want to tell them you're not much better than me.

492
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,990
- Because of it you have to apologize to me!
- Hey!

493
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,190
That moron too!

494
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:12,930
That Seung Ho's friend!
I want him to kneel in front of me and apologize.

495
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:16,200
Are you really this crazy?

496
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:18,140
- How bout you?
- You are such a lowly person?

497
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:23,740
Houw bout you? How great are you?
Does your education higher than me or does your family rich?

498
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:33,750
You forced me to be like this.

499
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:19,400
I told her we're here.
But Deputy Yoon can not be reached.

500
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,330
Do not mind her.

501
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:38,550
I'm going to die.

502
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:40,820
Just die!

503
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,290
Do you think I'm lying?

504
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,890
Yes, you lie.

505
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,490
You are really...

506
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:53,030
Hey! You really hate me that much?
You don't even care if i die?

507
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:55,700
Why can not I die?

508
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,770
How many times have I convinced you?

509
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,170
Because of that idiot?

510
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:03,570
Don't say this idot that idot

511
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:06,440
He's not a man that you can curse as you please.

512
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:10,050
It's not because of anyone.

513
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:13,120
Because I myself have been disgusted.

514
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,390
I'm the one who's stupid who has been thinking of you
as the center of my life ...

515
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:18,320
I was disgusted, as simple as that.

516
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:26,860
Gyoo Min, don't let us hate each other.

517
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:29,200
Live your life well, okay?

518
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:30,930
Be careful.

519
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:39,140
I will not give up!

520
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:42,680
I'll make you change your mind.

521
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,090
What is it?

522
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,690
What are you doing Deputy?

523
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:57,760
Did you dance the most popular move lately?

524
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,300
I saw you keep dancing
when did you have time taking these pics?

525
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,030
Who's keep dancing?

526
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:07,570
- When we leave Deputy Geum seems like being forced 
but it turns out she's the craziest.
- Yup, exactly!

527
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:11,370
I am a highly capable person to
dissolves in the situation.

528
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:12,380
<i>Good morning!</i>

529
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,050
Deputy, last night I sent a message to you.

530
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:17,050
Everything went smoothly after meeting with boyfriend?

531
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,980
Where did you know?

532
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:24,050
<i>That's not important.
What's important is you're back with him or not?</i>

533
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:25,590
<i>So, how?</i>

534
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:29,660
It's practically ended.

535
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:34,000
<i>I really want to contact you again
but your Joon Hee does not allow it.</i>

536
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,200
Yes, Boss?

537
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:46,680
The store at Gasan did really gives me a headache.
But Yoon Jin Ah manages to finish it.

538
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:52,820
Looks like the store owner wants us to close
our eye so that he protest against us.

539
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:57,350
Not only that, but most likely
is a feeling of dissatisfaction.

540
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:01,420
But if we let it go, everyone will
follow in his footsteps.

541
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,360
Better to cut it right to the root.

542
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,030
In such circumstances it is somewhat 
not a good move.

543
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:09,100
You're right.
The main focus of our priority is

544
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,030
we have to make the store can maintain
the operational well.

545
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:15,240
In short let Yoon Jin Ah finish it
and make the store recover as before.

546
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,370
At this stage, execute the company thightly

547
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:19,180
is the best solution.

548
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,980
Have you eat?

549
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,450
Oh ya, Deputy Yoon...

550
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:35,390
Regarding the using of personal cost for promotional merchandize
for new outlets opening ...

551
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:38,860
Ah, thst's...
I will try to finish it as soon as possible.

552
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:46,540
No, i think it would be a bit heavy
for an employee.

553
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:52,140
Let it be paid by the company.
I've done it. Just to know.

554
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:56,680
Isa-nim, I really do not think you are
pay that much attention to employees, I really respect you.

555
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:57,950
Nothing.

556
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:01,420
Yoon Daeri what are you waiting for?
Lower your head and say thank you Quick. 

557
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:05,290
Why? No need.

558
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,560
Thank you, Isa-nim.

559
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,770
Is it the work of you Director, right?

560
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:22,970
Remove the personal funds issue.

561
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:26,040
I'm not that great.

562
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,580
I just finished it accordingly
with company procedures.

563
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:31,310
How many years have I been working here.

564
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:33,520
Arguably I still have the ability 
to judge like this.

565
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,190
Before other people who also have the ability
to judge people knows..

566
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:38,050
You'd better get to work right away.

567
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:41,790
Thank you for always helping me.

568
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:44,390
I'm not just helping you.

569
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,600
So for a while you don't have to go to the office?

570
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:52,070
Yes, I have to work in the field.

571
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:52,740
Therefore...

572
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:57,140
the person in charge of this store
will be replaced with Kang Se Yeong.

573
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,880
I know who she is.

574
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,340
When Lee Gyoo Min's time came yesterday

575
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,680
she happened to be here to introduce herself.

576
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:05,150
How fast.

577
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,080
What?

578
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:08,080
Uh? Nothing

579
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,220
She works so fast.

580
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:12,890
In terms of work it should not be
causing any discomfort.

581
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:14,290
In terms of work?

582
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:15,860
Except this is for another period?

583
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,060
I mean if...

584
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,370
Oh!

585
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,370
You're worried I'll get closer to her?

586
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:27,370
So you're jealous already?

587
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,770
No, Mama.

588
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,510
I am hungry.
Let's go to eat!

589
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,440
I treat you.

590
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:36,450
Next time.
Today is the anniversary of mother's death.

591
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:39,320
Ah, it turns out today huh?
I forgot.

592
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,920
Even so it's okay.

593
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,450
Hey, do you want to accompany me shopping?

594
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:44,390
- I took my bag first.
- Okay

595
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:51,590
Time passed by.
It's been 10 years.

596
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:55,600
Yeah, right after Joon Hee's high school exams
she died.

597
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,800
It was really cold.

598
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,340
That's right, it's very cold.

599
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:08,010
About Father ... no news at all?

600
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:09,880
I'm more afraid if there's news from him.

601
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,150
I'm afraid if he said that his households
has gone again.

602
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:13,480
And invite me to live together.

603
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,620
Seeing you like this I feel that
You're cruel.

604
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,420
Because I'm cruel today is exist.

605
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,960
Hey, when I was left alone with Joon Hee

606
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,160
how do you think we can
survive?

607
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:33,970
Later after i met again 
with my mother in heaven ...

608
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,910
I have to file a super expensive
demand letter.

609
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:39,910
I will tell her if I am
raising my mother's son very well.

610
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,250
Do you think I have a right to do that or not?

611
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,580
Still need to be questioned?

612
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:45,980
You raised him so well.

613
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,720
Although I do not know what kind of woman he'll meet
and how Joon Hee will live his life,

614
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,390
but I want to be a vicious sis in law.

615
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,530
I could not bear to see him seeing
other people's faces everyday.

616
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:59,800
I have to pressed her from the beginning.

617
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:03,000
Hey, by hearing it only already makes me
feel scared.

618
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,740
Interesting, right? You just watch 
from the side.

619
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,210
Yeah, right.

620
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:11,540
Is it really ober between
You and Lee Gyoo Min?

621
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:12,740
Let's just talk other things!

622
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,540
Hey, one more question.

623
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,150
No matter how stupid he is,

624
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,080
how could he say there's something
between you and Joon Hee?

625
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,480
In which world is there a comedy like this?

626
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,950
Don't you think it's ridiculous?

627
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,890
That's why.

628
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,170
The evening crowd is not over yet.

629
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:37,900
Wonder if we can get a taxi
or not.

630
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,100
Joon Hee says he can pick us up.

631
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:08,200
Jin Ah, you're just going to go home.

632
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,930
No need.
I'll just go back from here.

633
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:11,070
It's not that far.

634
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,070
We'll just drive you home.

635
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,870
You hurry up and get the food ready.

636
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,470
I'll get the cart back.

637
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:16,740
Hey!

638
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,410
Hey, even if it's just for manners

639
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:23,080
at least you offer her.

640
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,610
<i>She's already said no?</i>

641
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:25,650
Really!

642
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,230
<i> You're still angry since a few
days ago?</i>

643
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:40,430
<i>What's wrong?
What's makes you upset?</i>

644
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:42,170
Upset what...?

645
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:47,440
Jin Ah Noona stopped by your shop?

646
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,640
Yeah, for this time being she has to go somewhere else
and worked as a temporary manager.

647
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:53,310
Just before almost spit out of words like
trash stores or something.

648
00:40:53,310 --> 00:40:55,310
Maybe because she does not have the heart
so she decide didn't do it.

649
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,650
She is.. really!

650
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:58,980
She did not broke upe with Lee Gyoo Min
firmly,

651
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:01,120
may be understandable.

652
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:04,990
She said you went to Jin Ah's house.
Why didn't tell me?

653
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:08,730
I was there just for an hour.

654
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:11,430
She told you this?

655
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,330
Nope.

656
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:15,060
Lee Gyoo Min came looking for me.

657
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:17,530
Really gave me a headache.

658
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,940
Looking for her? When?

659
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,070
Yesterday.

660
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:26,540
With employees from head office ...
What's her name then?

661
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,280
Ah, Kang Se Yeong.

662
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,210
I was talking to her...

663
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:31,880
He suddenly went inside.

664
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,620
Yoon Jin Ah also chases him inside.

665
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,290
Maybe they had a big fight yesterday.

666
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:38,560
Jin Ah looks as if
she'll have a duel with him.

667
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:43,360
It makes people feel uneasy.

668
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,830
I really hope Jin Ah can stay
near my house.

669
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:50,100
When you get angry, went home then went out again that day ...

670
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,300
I went to your house for a beer.

671
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:53,900
I heard there's people who rang the door bell
so I opened.

672
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,640
Apparently it's Jin Ah who stood in front of the door.

673
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,710
My house?

674
00:41:57,110 --> 00:42:00,240
She said because I'm not home,
so she thinks I'm at your house.

675
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,310
Hey, hey, turn right!

676
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,720
<i>What are you thinking about?</i>

677
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:15,260
<i>I'm home</i>

678
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,130
Yes.

679
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:25,540
Why buy so many fruits?

680
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,870
From Kyeong Seon.

681
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:31,010
Today is the KyeongSeon's mother's death anniversary,
so we're shopping together.

682
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:32,610
She asked me to take this for Eomma.

683
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,950
That's why I often say if
she is my eldest daughter.

684
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:40,480
Hey, sit here for a while.

685
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,820
- What is wrong?
- Sit down first.

686
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:46,820
You and Gyoo Min are really over?

687
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:47,560
Mom!

688
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:50,760
Yes, this is Gyoo Min's fault.

689
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:53,860
I know he did something inappropriate.

690
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57,900
What part of him that makes you
fall for him?

691
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:01,570
Because of his education is high?
Or because he's a rich kid's son?

692
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:04,510
What do you think I am?

693
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:06,180
One day, i don't care anyone you met,

694
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,780
I hope you can find
someone who's better than him.

695
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:12,120
Do not just look at his appearance only.
Already fall into a hole, then unable to go out alone.

696
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:15,180
There will be no such thing.

697
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,990
You promised me.

698
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:20,460
Eomma wait for me?

699
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:10,570
Eomma how do you look us?

700
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,710
My daughter is great.

701
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:17,580
My son... is super handsome.

702
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:22,850
Yoon Jin Ah loves to eat this.

703
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:24,850
If I know, I'll take her here.

704
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:28,180
Anyone who hears must have thought
she is your daughter.

705
00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:33,060
Sometimes I feel like she's
my daughter.

706
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,530
And I'm like his mother.

707
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:39,730
At the time Dad married again and
we live alone,

708
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:42,530
whose shoulder do you think that i could
lean my head on?

709
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:47,600
After all you are my little brother.

710
00:45:48,670 --> 00:45:53,010
Jin Ah was the one who wipes my tears
and wiped my nose.

711
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:56,350
Even for a siblings,
there may not be such a bond.

712
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:06,660
I still have two dreams.
You guessed it.

713
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:16,070
One, whatever that is
but that must have something to do with me.

714
00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:18,700
The other one I do not know.

715
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:22,310
Jin Ah finds a good husband.

716
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:27,110
Ah, because of talking about her
I miss her already.

717
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:31,320
What's that kid doing again?

718
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:44,790
Hey, what are you doing?

719
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:50,200
Tidying up the past?
Delete memory?

720
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:56,710
What?

721
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:58,940
Want to throw it all away?

722
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:01,080
You're wasting money again?

723
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:03,210
That's a show, a show.

724
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:07,420
Hey, what sins does your clothes have?

725
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:14,620
I Know.

726
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:18,960
Yes.

727
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:38,840
You...

728
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:40,710
Why are you here?

729
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:43,580
She said you came to my house.

730
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:48,450
Why did you go there?

731
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,260
Kyeong Seon just say this?

732
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:56,330
Why did she talk only a half?
Really.

733
00:48:56,330 --> 00:48:57,660
Why just say this?

734
00:48:58,190 --> 00:49:02,130
I went to Kyeong Seon's house
but she is there.

735
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:06,000
I have a feeling that she's in your house,
so I went there.

736
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,670
You're there to
meet my sis?

737
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:14,010
If Not... who else?

738
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,320
I want to ask, were you there looking for me?

739
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:23,620
That...

740
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:31,560
Yeah, I went there looking for you.

741
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:33,630
I feel guilty.

742
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:35,560
I also want to thank you.

743
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:40,640
But when i hear you talk
about logic and common sense ...

744
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:43,370
I'm glad that day i did not meet you.

745
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:45,840
If I hear that
in front of Kyeong Seon,

746
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,110
how embarrassed I am.

747
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:48,440
Why embarrassed?

748
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:50,380
Nothing wrong with my words.

749
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:58,920
Why are you ... suddenly here just to scold me? 
Do you think I'm an easy person?

750
00:49:58,920 --> 00:49:59,960
<i>That's right.</i>

751
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:02,060
Why do you have to show if
you are easy?

752
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:04,060
So that you meet a situation like this?

753
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:07,200
Dragged around by people who's
no one at all.

754
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,800
Who's dragged by whom?

755
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:12,540
You're ... really funny.

756
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:13,670
Really funny.

757
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:16,210
You're not laughing at all.
What is so funny?

758
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:22,610
Okay, just think of everything you
say is true.

759
00:50:22,610 --> 00:50:23,950
Nothing else you want to say?
Satisfied?

760
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:24,810
<i> I'm not done talking yet.</i>

761
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:31,890
What's about the umbrella?

762
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,160
I have a feeling it'll be raining tonight
so i bring it with me.

763
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:38,960
Why?

764
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,700
Did you say you want to tidying up 
your past?

765
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,030
You said you want to throw it all away.

766
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,300
What do you mean by this?

767
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,040
Then give it to me.
Let me throw it away.

768
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,770
Why should it be thrown away?
I struggled to pick it up again.

769
00:50:58,510 --> 00:50:59,520
Looks like you really like that umbrella.

770
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:01,250
Shit, you bas ...

771
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:04,250
Then keep it well.

772
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:05,320
Come here!

773
00:51:07,660 --> 00:51:08,990
Do you think i'm easy? 

774
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:11,060
Try it if you dare.

775
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:14,130
Are you angry?

776
00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:39,960
You can not not go home huh?

777
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:42,890
Then where should i go?

778
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:48,500
Just what is on your mind?

779
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:51,900
Nothing.

780
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:55,840
Why? What is wrong?

781
00:51:56,510 --> 00:51:57,310
Nothing.

782
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,310
Let's get out!

783
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:04,310
Okay.

784
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:10,650
What do you want to eat?

785
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:11,850
Ah, no need.

786
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,390
Why? How about Cola?

787
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:15,990
I feel guilty again.

788
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:17,530
I don't bring any money.

789
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:20,200
If you do not have me, you do not have the fare home.
You can not go home!

790
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,330
Ah, got again.

791
00:52:22,330 --> 00:52:23,530
I have to exploit it.

792
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,730
Then let's just say the Cola
is a service from me.

793
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:27,940
If so, popcorn too please!

That's mine

00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:11,310
What?

841
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:14,720
Oh...

842
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:33,940
That movie is bad.

843
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:36,170
So the one you watched was not a movie.

844
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:39,810
I think you watch the same thing
as mine. 

845
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:40,810
No way!

846
00:53:43,610 --> 00:53:44,750
Are you hungry?

847
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,350
Yes I'm hungry!

848
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:50,820
Try saying "please treat me a yummy meal!"

849
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:52,490
You want to die?

850
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:54,160
Give it to me.

851
00:53:55,890 --> 00:53:57,490
What? You want to buy me a meal?

852
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,630
You're gonna treat, right?

853
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,110
Seems so exciting.

854
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,990
Even so do not praise it in front of me.

855
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:28,790
Ah, okay okay.

856
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:30,460
I do not understand how to read a situation.

857
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,530
I'm provoking me to get beyond that.

858
00:54:48,010 --> 00:54:49,350
Seems a bit too far.

859
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:09,370
The model really ...

860
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:06,420
When will it be done?

861
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,160
So tired.

862
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:10,960
Less prominent features or something like that.

863
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:12,690
Nothing special.

864
00:56:12,690 --> 00:56:14,700
Stop it.

865
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:16,330
I am done.

866
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:17,370
Let me see!

867
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:21,370
Where's my pay?

868
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,370
I told you I did not bring money.

869
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:26,240
Have to be money?

870
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:27,840
So what do you want?

871
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:31,110
I did not bring anything.

872
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:35,120
Oh, there it is!

873
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:35,980
What?

874
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:38,720
Great facial expression.

875
00:56:40,490 --> 00:56:41,090
Here!

876
00:56:42,930 --> 00:56:43,790
Wow!

877
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:50,330
This is my look?

878
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,270
<i>Exactly!</i>

879
00:56:53,270 --> 00:56:55,740
Wow, exactly as if it's photographed.

880
00:56:56,370 --> 00:56:58,540
Does my body looks like this?

881
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,840
Yes, your body is small.

882
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:05,810
Hey, but it does not seem as small as it is.

883
00:57:05,810 --> 00:57:06,880
It does though.

884
00:57:07,220 --> 00:57:09,080
Nuna is small and adorable.

885
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:13,620
Adorable?

886
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:17,230
How old I am, really.

887
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:23,130
It depends on who sees it.

888
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:27,170
Hmm... okay.

889
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,470
Ah, still.

890
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:32,710
I'm now way past the age where
people call me adorable.

891
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:37,310
When I was in my 20s, I often did
hear people say so.

892
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,450
Ah I really know Nuna's past.

893
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:43,190
It's not till that much.

894
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,660
Yeah right, you know my past.

895
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:48,060
If not, that's ok.

896
00:57:51,330 --> 00:57:53,060
Ah, after I think about it
it seems yes.

897
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:55,260
True, quite adorable.

898
00:57:56,530 --> 00:57:58,400
Like a movie star.

899
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,470
Today let's just walk and eat until satisfied.

900
00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:05,670
I'll find a time to
get it back to you 10 times.

901
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:07,610
You have to get ready for it!

902
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:08,410
I won't be shy.

903
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:09,810
I'll finish you.

904
00:58:10,810 --> 00:58:12,750
Just leave my clothes alone.

905
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:13,780
This woman, really.

906
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:16,750
It seems like you like a 
porn joke?

907
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:19,720
I'm just kidding.

908
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:27,760
You said you wanted to
fix your past.

909
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:32,370
Then I'm one of your past,
is that like that?

910
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:35,300
What's that like?

911
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,840
No.. what does that mean?

912
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:41,980
How could you have any thoughts
to throw it away?

913
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,450
What do you mean throw it away?

914
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:47,980
It's because i accidentally take it out.
That's why i keep holding it.

915
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:51,320
You said that you're affraid it'll be raining
that's why you take it with you?

916
00:58:52,590 --> 00:58:56,790
Well, if it's raining, i'll use it.
If it's not raining then all is good.

917
00:58:56,790 --> 00:58:58,590
What other purpose does Umbrella have?

918
00:58:58,590 --> 00:59:00,260
Why do you insist to have a meaning behind it?

919
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:05,930
No, it's not like that.

920
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,670
But still do not throw it away.

921
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:13,080
Who said I will throw it away?

922
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:15,480
What if you throw it away?

923
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:17,880
I won't for sure.

924
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:20,150
Why for sure?
*gosh he's teasing her so hard XD*

925
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:24,820
You forced me again to think strange things.

926
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:26,360
What do you want?

927
00:59:27,290 --> 00:59:28,820
Take care of it carefully.

928
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:31,090
I will.
*awww ^3^*

929
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:57,190
I am home.

930
00:59:57,990 --> 00:59:59,250
What are you gonna do upstairs?

931
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:02,320
Ha?

932
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:04,530
Sleep right away?

933
01:00:06,730 --> 01:00:08,130
Not right away

934
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:10,730
Why? What do you want?
*please think the same thing as me :p*

935
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:14,800
What are you going to do?
*kidnap you and put you on my bed UwU*

936
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:18,410
I do not know.. what do you want to do?

937
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:24,010
Want to join?
*=^3^=*

938
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:30,090
How about this?
*kay won't spazz again from now on, sorry /bows/*

939
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:33,760
Not yet, not yet.

940
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,430
Where am I supposed to go? Come here?

941
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:42,960
Nuna I will find you.
You wait for me there.

942
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,300
Have you found it? Have you found it?

943
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:49,300
Follow me.

944
01:00:50,370 --> 01:00:52,170
Okay, you wait for me.

945
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:05,590
You come with me, right?

946
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:41,750
How long will you be placed in the Gasan store?

947
01:02:41,750 --> 01:02:42,850
Don't know.

948
01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:44,220
Please take good care of my other shops.

949
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:45,950
Later after I return
I will buy you a good food.

950
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:48,020
We'll wait for it.

951
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:49,490
Then I go out first.

952
01:02:49,490 --> 01:02:51,630
Hmm, sorry has troubled you.

953
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:56,730
Deputy Geum's location is slightly far.

954
01:02:56,730 --> 01:02:59,100
That's why I only gave you two locations.

955
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:01,770
Want me to thank you?

956
01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:04,570
What's with her?

957
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:07,440
Deputy Yoon Daeri is not on purpose
do not want to work.

958
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:12,050
So? Nothing special with
shop in Suseo?

959
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:15,250
The one that the shop owner need is
might be something like personal taste.

960
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:16,380
Why ask her?

961
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:18,390
Just ask your brother right away.

962
01:03:20,990 --> 01:03:23,120
Geum Bo Ra's really have a brain.

963
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:26,360
Later do not forget to treat me to eat a good food!

964
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:29,130
Yes

965
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:31,270
It should be her who treat you, isn't it?

966
01:03:31,270 --> 01:03:33,500
Looks like after taking over the store
in Suseo you're so happy.

967
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,800
Working happily, of course I'm happy.

968
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:37,670
I'm not talking about work.

969
01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:41,340
She wants to have developments with
Seo Joon Hee.

970
01:03:41,340 --> 01:03:44,210
Ye Eun, why you don't want them
to get along?

971
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,620
Not only don't like it.

972
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:48,750
If Deputy Kang is dating your brother,

973
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:50,090
what do you think you'll do?

974
01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:50,890
My brother?

975
01:03:50,890 --> 01:03:51,690
Yes

976
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:54,420
That's ridiculous.
What are you talking about?

977
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:55,220
See that.

978
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:58,090
Seo Joon Hee is your friend's brother.

979
01:03:58,090 --> 01:04:00,700
'It's not much different from your brother?

980
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:08,570
Yeah, right.
But my brother is my brother.

981
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:12,840
Friend's brother with my own brother
How could it be the same?

982
01:04:16,410 --> 01:04:17,710
Any coffee in the office?

983
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:22,450
I go first.

984
01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:30,330
Gosh, so fresh!
It's so good.

985
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:31,860
Really?

986
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:33,930
I just brewed it carelessly.

987
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:35,660
Careless brewed coffee is already this good?

988
01:04:36,430 --> 01:04:38,400
Good coffee is different.

989
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:58,020
Who did this exactly? Really!

990
01:05:03,020 --> 01:05:06,760
Lately there is a series of actions that destroy the goods.

991
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:08,630
It's hard to get noticed.

992
01:05:09,300 --> 01:05:11,230
Why do not we have something special?

993
01:05:11,230 --> 01:05:14,700
For example a kind of mason and wizard.

994
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:16,500
Bricklayer? Wizard?

995
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:17,770
Classic!

996
01:05:18,170 --> 01:05:20,640
It's the same that Seo Joon Hee once talked about before, right?

997
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:22,640
It seems so.

998
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:28,120
Are not you feeling well?

999
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:35,260
I slightly nauseous also got a headache.

1000
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:37,130
All day not feeling well.

1001
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:39,660
Try eating this.

1002
01:05:40,330 --> 01:05:41,600
Yes...

1003
01:05:42,330 --> 01:05:44,800
If you're sick better go to the hospital.

1004
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,400
All right, then I'll be right there.

1005
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:01,620
He just said that he's a bit not 
feeling well.

1006
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:03,690
Yes.

1007
01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:15,630
I can take a taxi there.

1008
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:17,430
You're so busy.
You skip work, right?

1009
01:06:17,430 --> 01:06:18,500
Nope...

1010
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:20,440
I'm going out after the meeting is over.

1011
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:22,100
<i>I'm very competent.</i>

1012
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:24,570
Without me our company won't be
able to operate.

1013
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:27,780
Oh, that's great?
How come I don't think it's like that?

1014
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:29,240
Don't you think?

1015
01:06:29,510 --> 01:06:31,910
Noona is not very smart
in judging guys.

1016
01:06:31,910 --> 01:06:34,580
Huh, are you a man?

1017
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:39,720
I'm just a metaphor.

1018
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,320
Why should it be clarified?

1019
01:06:44,330 --> 01:06:47,000
I do not mean to ensure anything.

1020
01:06:48,330 --> 01:06:49,400
You are a man.

1021
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:50,730
It's true You are a man.

1022
01:06:51,930 --> 01:06:52,930
What are you talking about?

1023
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,200
What time are you going back?

1024
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:56,000
Later?

1025
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,410
Officially starting to work tomorrow.

1026
01:06:59,410 --> 01:07:01,940
I can go out anytime at Night.
Why?

1027
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:03,950
I'll pick you up.

1028
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:05,480
Really?

1029
01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:07,820
Ah, what's for.

1030
01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:10,890
Can I?

1031
01:07:12,020 --> 01:07:13,420
<i>Aigoo, really.</i>

1032
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:15,490
Starting tomorrow we'll start earlier.

1033
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:17,560
You should not drink beer.
Have to sleep earlier, kay?

1034
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:20,300
I'll make a PO for all the ingredients 
which still in deficit.

1035
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:22,760
Aigoo seems to be the host and guest role is twisted.

1036
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:25,700
Either I may or may not torture employees from headquarters.

1037
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:27,240
It is a luxury to pay attention to the heart right now.

1038
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:29,370
Aja-aja hwaiting!
Lots of profit!

1039
01:07:29,770 --> 01:07:30,910
Hwaiting.

1040
01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:35,180
But ... you suddenly turned so cheerful.

1041
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:37,180
Me? Really?

1042
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:38,980
It feels like two different people.

1043
01:07:39,710 --> 01:07:41,650
Due to the person waiting outside?

1044
01:07:45,650 --> 01:07:47,320
I'll go home first!

1045
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:48,320
Have a good time.

1046
01:08:42,110 --> 01:08:43,610
Noona, that..

1047
01:08:47,650 --> 01:08:48,850
I mean if...

1048
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:53,250
If what?

1049
01:08:56,890 --> 01:08:58,060
If I...

1050
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:01,660
You what?

1051
01:09:04,730 --> 01:09:05,730
I mean not me...

1052
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:08,870
Noona, I...

1053
01:09:09,340 --> 01:09:10,470
I...

1054
01:09:13,070 --> 01:09:19,810
Ask you to treat me tomorrow,
will you do that?

1055
01:09:23,850 --> 01:09:25,820
Did not I ever treat you?

1056
01:09:26,350 --> 01:09:28,690
Of course you can,
treat you to eat until you are full.

1057
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:34,360
Seriusly?

1058
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:36,760
Ofc!

1059
01:09:38,430 --> 01:09:39,370
Alright.

1060
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:42,550
So soon?

1061
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:44,490
Yeah!

1062
01:12:46,020 --> 01:12:47,560
Today I feel good.

1063
01:12:50,490 --> 01:12:52,090
Can be more exciting if you want to.

1064
01:12:53,290 --> 01:12:54,960
It's not only today...

1065
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:56,930
Isn't it?

1066
01:13:00,770 --> 01:13:01,970
- In that case...
- Yeah.

1067
01:13:01,970 --> 01:13:02,900
I went home first..?

1068
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:10,850
= The door is already open. =

1069
01:13:11,910 --> 01:13:13,310
You go home.

1070
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:56,180
It's a service for you.

1071
01:13:56,180 --> 01:13:57,380
thanks.

1072
01:13:57,840 --> 01:13:59,850
Now is not the afternoon drinking time, but here still many guests huh?

1073
01:13:59,850 --> 01:14:02,110
It seems that Deputy and Jeonju-nim are very cohesive.

1074
01:14:02,110 --> 01:14:04,250
Your tone sounds a little strange.

1075
01:14:04,250 --> 01:14:06,450
I mean you meet at the right time.

1076
01:14:06,450 --> 01:14:08,450
The relationship between men and women also depends on the timing factor.

1077
01:14:08,450 --> 01:14:10,190
Mostly it's because the guy is blind.

1078
01:14:10,190 --> 01:14:11,720
It's so easy to mess things up.

1079
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:13,790
Yes

1080
01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:16,600
I feel this way too.

1081
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:18,660
But what if the timing goes wrong?

1082
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:20,330
Wait until the timing is right?

1083
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:23,470
If not dead by age,
it would be die because of weakness.

1084
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:25,540
If you keep testing until things become clear,

1085
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:27,340
it will be game over.

1086
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:30,740
Why?
At least both know that they like each other.

1087
01:14:30,940 --> 01:14:33,550
Knew it, but it feels like almost dying because of short of breath.

1088
01:14:33,550 --> 01:14:35,950
Suddenlt there come a hunter who
immediately shot to the target.

1089
01:14:35,950 --> 01:14:38,480
It feels good and fresh.

1090
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:40,350
He will be taken immediately.

1091
01:14:42,750 --> 01:14:44,490
Looks like the timing is really important.

Got one serving!

1104

Hit it?

1105
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:15,720
Good! Perfect!

Daebak! Daebak!

Hey, it's your turn.

Got it! got it!

1117
01:15:53,430 --> 01:15:54,760
Clear this place.

1118
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:55,690
Yes, Yes.

1119
01:15:57,760 --> 01:15:59,430
Boss,we really got a ribeye steak!

1120
01:16:05,370 --> 01:16:06,970
<i> Tonight I have to go back to the office.</i>

1121
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:17,320
<i>You're still working?</i>

1122
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:21,050
<i>My team dinner will be over soon.</i>

1123
01:16:22,390 --> 01:16:23,720
<i>Until when do you plan to stay there?</i>

1124
01:16:26,660 --> 01:16:27,930
<i>There are still unfinished jobs.</i>

1125
01:16:27,930 --> 01:16:29,390
<i> It looks like it will be long.</i>

1126
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:31,800
<i>Who do you texting with religiously?</i>

1127
01:16:32,860 --> 01:16:34,730
Oh, my friend.

1128
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:36,800
From Suseo shop?

1129
01:16:37,140 --> 01:16:38,940
I mean Joon Hee's sister.

1130
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:42,070
No, another friend.

1131
01:16:45,740 --> 01:16:48,150
Ah ... it's done!

1132
01:16:48,150 --> 01:16:49,150
Hungry.

1133
01:16:49,150 --> 01:16:50,480
Let's go eat outside!

1134
01:16:51,150 --> 01:16:52,680
You have to treat me.

1135
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:58,160
I ... there is still something to be done.

1136
01:16:59,490 --> 01:17:01,830
What else other than activity reports?

1137
01:17:03,430 --> 01:17:04,760
Clearly finished.

1138
01:17:05,230 --> 01:17:06,370
What is it?

1139
01:17:06,370 --> 01:17:07,970
You do not want to treat me to eat huh?

1140
01:17:08,430 --> 01:17:10,300
Come on, I treat you.

1141
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:17,240
thanks.

1142
01:17:21,180 --> 01:17:23,080
The second round is next time?

1143
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:23,720
What do you mean?

1144
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:24,920
It's not you who pay this.

1145
01:17:25,450 --> 01:17:29,190
You're planning to force people
eat to death?

1146
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:33,090
Hey, that's...

1147
01:17:33,090 --> 01:17:33,990
The pretty one from the coffee company.

1148
01:17:33,990 --> 01:17:34,730
Where are you going?

1149
01:17:34,930 --> 01:17:35,990
Yes, true.

1150
01:17:37,930 --> 01:17:38,730
Noona!

1151
01:17:39,260 --> 01:17:40,870
Hello!

1152
01:17:42,130 --> 01:17:43,300
Where are you going?

1153
01:17:43,300 --> 01:17:45,200
We just want to eat.

1154
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:46,670
You guys just have a company dinner?

1155
01:17:46,670 --> 01:17:49,540
Yeah, just a few people.

1156
01:17:49,540 --> 01:17:50,810
Where do you want to eat?

1157
01:17:50,810 --> 01:17:52,610
Around here.

1158
01:17:52,610 --> 01:17:53,950
We're still looking too.

1159
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:59,480
But Joon Hee, if you just have company dinner 
you should have done eating, right?

1160
01:18:00,220 --> 01:18:05,360
Ah, we want to go have a drink.

1161
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:06,430
There's nothing to eat.

1162
01:18:06,430 --> 01:18:08,630
If we go together ... is it okay?

1163
01:18:08,630 --> 01:18:11,360
I do not know ...

1164
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:12,960
We also do not plan on eating.

1165
01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:18,700
<i>Really a lot of people who think
like that.</i>

1166
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:20,970
<i>But I'm not at all.</i>

1167
01:18:20,970 --> 01:18:23,910
I have a little experience on relationship.

1168
01:18:24,910 --> 01:18:26,980
Deputy Yoon Daeri is far more experienced than me.

1169
01:18:27,850 --> 01:18:29,050
<i>Oh really?</i>

1170
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:31,250
<i>What then?</i>

1171
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:33,850
What kind of guy do you like?

1172
01:18:35,190 --> 01:18:36,790
Well...

1173
01:18:37,190 --> 01:18:39,060
Who makes me feel comfortable is enough.

1174
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:41,990
Ah, you hate bad guys.

1175
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:43,160
Then Seo Joon Hee is not qualified.

1176
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:45,200
<i>You're dead!Go home, go home.</i>

1177
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:48,130
Joon Hee, you a naughty guy type?

1178
01:18:49,130 --> 01:18:50,800
They talk nonsense.

1179
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,270
What nonsense?

1180
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:53,270
Yes, okay.

1181
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:54,870
Then just think as if you are not.

1182
01:18:54,870 --> 01:18:56,880
How many time did you fail when chasing 
a girl?

1183
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:58,140
<i>Never, right?</i>

1184
01:18:58,140 --> 01:18:59,650
<i>This means...?</i>

1185
01:18:59,950 --> 01:19:01,210
<i>The time you determine your mind,</i>

1186
01:19:01,210 --> 01:19:03,820
the girl you want
Definitely--

1187
01:19:03,820 --> 01:19:04,950
You want to die?

1188
01:19:04,950 --> 01:19:07,550
You mean the success rate
is 100%?

1189
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:13,090
No, 99%.

1190
01:19:14,830 --> 01:19:16,500
What's one percent left?

1191
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:20,570
This means there is one girl who failed 
to be conquered by Seo Joon Hee.

1192
01:19:20,570 --> 01:19:21,570
Who?

1193
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:23,500
Who is it?

1194
01:19:34,380 --> 01:19:35,380
Let's drink! Drink!

1195
01:19:57,740 --> 01:20:00,810
Do you know who's the lady that
Joon Hee mention?

1196
01:20:02,410 --> 01:20:04,080
How could I know?

1197
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:09,610
It should a woman younger than us.

1198
01:20:10,750 --> 01:20:13,690
We're not that old, okay?

1199
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:18,820
Don't know who claims that she is old
and having trouble getting up early.

1200
01:20:18,820 --> 01:20:22,160
That's because .... so tired so
body condition is not good.

1201
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:26,360
How great is the woman?

1202
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:28,370
How could Seo Joon Hee
failed to get her?

1203
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:36,240
But you ... why have you been smiling by yourself?

1204
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:38,440
Me?

1205
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:40,050
i didn't though!

1206
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:44,580
For sure, he has someone.

1207
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:49,050
But no progress at all
with that person, right?

1208
01:20:51,190 --> 01:20:53,990
If attack at a time like this,
victory will side with me.

1209
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:59,530
I have to speed up the progress.

1210
01:21:00,870 --> 01:21:02,130
Must be more passionate.

1211
01:21:10,340 --> 01:21:12,410
<i>Hey, but actually because of what </i>

1212
01:21:12,410 --> 01:21:14,210
<i>until such an expert hesitates.</i>

1213
01:21:14,210 --> 01:21:16,410
There must be some fatal reason behind it.

1214
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,490
Just ... afraid there is an 'if'.

1215
01:21:21,020 --> 01:21:21,950
<i>What's that?</i>

1216
01:21:22,350 --> 01:21:23,890
You mean you're not sure?

1217
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:25,360
No.

1218
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:29,760
I'm sure I have.

1219
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:30,900
She's not sure?

1220
01:21:34,030 --> 01:21:36,600
I have not opened my mouth and asked her out.

1221
01:21:38,770 --> 01:21:40,770
You also can be nervous?

1222
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:43,710
Why? You're affraid she reject you?

1223
01:21:43,710 --> 01:21:45,840
That's why I say fear there is "if".

1224
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:49,920
Does that girl knows you did
trash stuff like this?

1225
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:53,150
Trash? What about me?

1226
01:21:53,150 --> 01:21:54,190
<i>Aigoo...</i>

1227
01:21:55,990 --> 01:21:57,590
Looks like you like her a lot.

1228
01:21:57,590 --> 01:21:59,890
You really like her till you feel you're going to die.

1229
01:22:00,330 --> 01:22:01,730
Ah, where...

1230
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:05,000
Come on, change topic! Change topic!

1231
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:10,000
What's important for now is you
still have not take any decision.

1232
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:11,740
Is that right?

1233
01:22:18,940 --> 01:22:24,420
For now ... you can say so.

<i>That's because you do not know how important it is
timings between men and women.</i>

1237
01:23:02,450 --> 01:23:04,790
<i>So are we dating?</i>

1238
01:23:04,790 --> 01:23:06,320
<i>You're beautiful.</i>

<i>Are you crazy?</i>

1240

<i> I'm crazy.
Crazy because of someone.</i>

1241

<i>Do you want to play my house?</i>

1242

<i>But ... is this really okay?</i>

1243

<i>You set yourself right.</i>

pay attention to this all?</i>

<i>I ... should not hold your hand.</i>
