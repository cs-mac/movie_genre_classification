FLASH OF GENIUS (2008)

2
00:00:56,269 --> 00:00:57,497
<i>On the Maryland Giant,</i>

3
00:00:57,571 --> 00:01:01,132
<i>I'm the Fryman in the morning,
and it's time for sports!</i>

4
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:04,473
<i>The Orioles continue to
shoot skyward like a Saturn V.</i>

5
00:01:04,544 --> 00:01:06,171
<i>Having locked up the
pennant over a week ago,</i>

6
00:01:06,246 --> 00:01:09,340
<i>last night in Municipal
Stadium in front of over 19,000.</i>

7
00:01:18,024 --> 00:01:21,152
Excuse me, sir. Can I speak
with one of your passengers?

8
00:01:21,228 --> 00:01:22,559
Sure. Go ahead.
Go in back.

9
00:01:22,629 --> 00:01:24,859
I'll go back there now. Thanks.

10
00:01:29,269 --> 00:01:30,759
Robert Kearns?

11
00:01:33,473 --> 00:01:34,872
Dr. Kearns?

12
00:01:36,476 --> 00:01:37,465
Yes?

13
00:01:37,544 --> 00:01:40,411
<i>Sir, your family's very
concerned about you.</i>

14
00:01:42,682 --> 00:01:44,707
<i>Why don't you
come with us?</i>

15
00:01:44,785 --> 00:01:47,982
The Vice President asked
me to come to Washington.

16
00:01:49,423 --> 00:01:51,357
Yes, sir,
we understand.

17
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,059
You should
come with us.

18
00:01:58,765 --> 00:02:00,426
I suppose I could.

19
00:02:02,636 --> 00:02:03,694
Hmm.

20
00:02:09,176 --> 00:02:11,076
I'll take that
for you.

21
00:02:12,078 --> 00:02:13,477
Be careful.

22
00:02:14,314 --> 00:02:15,941
<i>That's for my kids.</i>

23
00:02:16,016 --> 00:02:19,110
<i>Don't you worry, sir.
We'll take good care of it.</i>

24
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:28,321
<i>Scott, you and Louise want to come
to our place for dinner tonight?</i>

25
00:02:28,395 --> 00:02:29,760
<i>Well, what about
the Pistons game?</i>

26
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:32,094
No, I gave my tickets to my kids.

27
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:34,230
Prices where they are, you
gotta be kidding. Hiya, Bob.

28
00:02:34,301 --> 00:02:36,292
<i>Hey.
How's the teaching going?</i>

29
00:02:36,369 --> 00:02:38,064
Oh, good.

30
00:02:38,138 --> 00:02:41,130
How many Kearns kids
are there now? 13?

31
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:43,267
I can divine it.
Oh, you can divine it.

32
00:02:43,343 --> 00:02:46,244
What Scott here divines is that
the Knicks have two guys out

33
00:02:46,313 --> 00:02:47,905
with ankle injuries,
right, Bob?

34
00:02:47,981 --> 00:02:50,279
Mmm. You talking
about basketball?

35
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,376
Kearns, you probably mean that.

36
00:02:55,422 --> 00:02:56,548
I do.

37
00:03:16,076 --> 00:03:19,603
As I look out over this
sea of familiar faces,

38
00:03:20,413 --> 00:03:22,938
I see men from
G.M., A.M.C.,

39
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:25,908
Ford, Chrysler,
Jeep and Dodge

40
00:03:25,986 --> 00:03:28,511
all under one roof,
as it should be.

41
00:03:29,022 --> 00:03:31,183
And it brings to
mind the apostles.

42
00:03:31,258 --> 00:03:36,025
What was it that brought these
very different men together as one?

43
00:03:38,865 --> 00:03:41,095
Father Rooney was good
today, huh? He was funny.

44
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:43,294
He was great.
He really was.

45
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,394
Can I pinch you?

46
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:46,371
No, dipshit. Mom, make
him stop calling me...

47
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:47,599
What did you just say?

48
00:03:47,674 --> 00:03:50,142
<i>Dipstick. It's an automotive term, Mom.</i>

49
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,610
Well, say that one more time and
I will have your chassis waxed.

50
00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:55,239
<i>Okay? That's an automotive term, too.</i>

51
00:03:56,182 --> 00:03:58,173
Look at this.

52
00:03:58,251 --> 00:04:02,654
<i>I turn this thing off, 10
seconds later, I can't see.</i>

53
00:04:02,722 --> 00:04:03,848
<i>I can't see, either.</i>

54
00:04:03,924 --> 00:04:05,858
So you turn it back on,

55
00:04:07,027 --> 00:04:09,427
<i>and now the
windshield's clean,</i>

56
00:04:09,496 --> 00:04:10,929
But the wipers
are dragging.

57
00:04:10,997 --> 00:04:12,430
You hear that, that
screeching? Mmm-hmm.

58
00:04:12,499 --> 00:04:14,797
<i>Yeah, I hear it, I hear
it. Yeah, it's annoying.</i>

59
00:04:14,868 --> 00:04:17,837
<i>All right, so it's raining
and I turn it back off.</i>

60
00:04:17,904 --> 00:04:20,065
But now I can
barely see.

61
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,971
<i>I can't... I can't see anything,
sweetie. I can't, either.</i>

62
00:04:22,042 --> 00:04:23,634
<i>Sweetie, turn them on. Right
now, I can't see a thing.</i>

63
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,371
<i>If I don't turn this thing on
right now, we'll hit somebody.</i>

64
00:04:25,445 --> 00:04:26,434
Turn it on, honey. Please.

65
00:04:26,513 --> 00:04:27,775
Look at this!

66
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:30,541
<i>Okay, that's
not funny at all.</i>

67
00:04:30,617 --> 00:04:31,743
Whoa. All right.
All right. All right.

68
00:04:31,818 --> 00:04:33,547
Ten thousand engineers
in Detroit,

69
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,645
<i>you'd think they'd know
how to design an automobile.</i>

70
00:04:45,632 --> 00:04:47,532
What are you doing?

71
00:04:47,601 --> 00:04:50,229
Oh, I was thinking
about how eyes work.

72
00:04:51,638 --> 00:04:54,732
<i>We blink about every four, six seconds,
and there's this lachrymal fluid and...</i>

73
00:04:54,808 --> 00:04:56,070
Really?

74
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,643
Interesting.

75
00:05:02,248 --> 00:05:04,443
And what are you
thinking about?

76
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,748
<i>I'm thinking we should make another kid.</i>

77
00:05:11,491 --> 00:05:13,925
Gotcha.
Yeah.

78
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:18,891
<i>Oh, that's good.
You're funny.</i>

79
00:05:32,812 --> 00:05:34,109
<i>I'm gonna be
right back.</i>

80
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,670
Huh? Huh?
Yeah.

81
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:19,455
Spell "giant. "

82
00:06:19,526 --> 00:06:21,585
<i>G- I... G- I-A-N-T.
It's so easy.</i>

83
00:06:21,661 --> 00:06:24,095
<i>Is your name Kathy? Is it
your test? I don't think so.</i>

84
00:06:24,164 --> 00:06:25,392
<i>It's Kathy's test. Kathy,
what's the next one?</i>

85
00:06:25,465 --> 00:06:26,489
Puppy.

86
00:06:26,566 --> 00:06:29,057
<i>Puppy or science? Puppy's
too easy. Do science.</i>

87
00:06:29,135 --> 00:06:31,899
Hi, poop.
Okay. S-C-I-E-N-C-E.

88
00:06:31,971 --> 00:06:33,802
<i>Six minutes, you guys. Come
on, let's really hustle.</i>

89
00:06:33,873 --> 00:06:35,397
S- C-I-E-N-C-E.

90
00:06:35,475 --> 00:06:36,965
<i>When is
Calvin's sleepover?</i>

91
00:06:37,043 --> 00:06:38,533
Friday. I have to call
his mom. Can I go...

92
00:06:38,611 --> 00:06:40,010
<i>"Police described the
badly decomposed body... "</i>

93
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,638
<i>I don't think so today,
sweetie. I don't know.</i>

94
00:06:41,715 --> 00:06:43,512
<i>"... as one of the most
gruesome crimes... " What time?</i>

95
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,073
What is that?
My current event.

96
00:06:45,151 --> 00:06:46,880
<i>I thought we agreed we weren't
doing murders for a while.</i>

97
00:06:46,953 --> 00:06:48,511
Mom, what
about after school?

98
00:06:48,588 --> 00:06:50,351
Honey, good morning.
Hey.

99
00:06:50,423 --> 00:06:51,890
<i>You tired?
No, I'm fine.</i>

100
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,152
What time did
you come to bed?

101
00:06:53,226 --> 00:06:55,660
<i>I don't really know. Are
you substituting today?</i>

102
00:06:55,729 --> 00:06:57,629
Yeah, fourth grade.
Eat something.

103
00:06:57,697 --> 00:06:59,631
No, no. I'll get something at
school. That seems like a lot.

104
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:00,996
<i>No, they called.
It's at Pat's school,</i>

105
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:02,364
and so I can pick
them up after anyway.

106
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:04,164
<i>Well, who's gonna watch him?
And I'm gonna take him to the...</i>

107
00:07:04,237 --> 00:07:06,137
<i>Don't worry about it. Eat
something, honey. Okay. Hey.</i>

108
00:07:06,206 --> 00:07:07,195
Bye, kids.
All right?

109
00:07:07,273 --> 00:07:08,865
See you, Dad.
Bye, Dad.

110
00:07:08,942 --> 00:07:10,273
<i>Bye, Dad. Don't use your wipers today.</i>

111
00:07:10,343 --> 00:07:11,537
Bob, what?

112
00:07:11,611 --> 00:07:13,545
Yeah, I needed
the motor.

113
00:07:13,613 --> 00:07:14,841
Honey, what
if it rains?

114
00:07:14,914 --> 00:07:17,007
<i>No, no. It's
not gonna rain.</i>

115
00:07:29,262 --> 00:07:31,856
Good morning, everybody.
I want to welcome you all

116
00:07:31,931 --> 00:07:36,425
to the first day of the quarter
for Applied Electrical Engineering.

117
00:07:36,503 --> 00:07:38,198
My name is Dr. Robert Kearns

118
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:41,604
<i>and I'd like to start by
talking to you about ethics.</i>

119
00:07:41,674 --> 00:07:45,872
<i>I can't think of a job or a career
where the understanding of ethics</i>

120
00:07:45,945 --> 00:07:47,970
is more important
than engineering.

121
00:07:48,047 --> 00:07:51,107
Who designed the artificial
aortic heart valve?

122
00:07:53,686 --> 00:07:55,483
An engineer did that.

123
00:07:56,256 --> 00:07:59,589
And who designed the gas
chambers at Auschwitz?

124
00:08:01,294 --> 00:08:03,524
An engineer did that, too.

125
00:08:03,596 --> 00:08:07,532
One man was responsible for helping
save tens of thousands of lives,

126
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,364
another man
helped kill millions.

127
00:08:10,436 --> 00:08:13,872
<i>Now, I don't know what any of you
are gonna end up doing in your lives,</i>

128
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,239
but I can guarantee you
that there will come a day

129
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:19,710
where you have
a decision to make,

130
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:25,217
<i>and it won't be as easy as deciding
between a heart valve and a gas chamber.</i>

131
00:08:25,285 --> 00:08:27,719
Everything we do
in this classroom

132
00:08:28,087 --> 00:08:32,148
ultimately comes back to
that notion. All right?

133
00:08:33,793 --> 00:08:35,055
Grades count, too.

134
00:08:48,608 --> 00:08:50,633
Hi, Jerry.
Dr. Kearns.

135
00:08:51,211 --> 00:08:54,339
<i>I'm gonna make a donut
run. Are you interested?</i>

136
00:08:54,581 --> 00:08:56,981
<i>Mmm, you can't do
it mechanically.</i>

137
00:08:57,217 --> 00:08:58,809
<i>Can't do what?</i>

138
00:08:58,885 --> 00:09:03,083
<i>That's the pause between
wipes. That was my mistake.</i>

139
00:09:03,156 --> 00:09:06,785
<i>Can't do it mechanically. You might
be able to do it electronically.</i>

140
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,829
Oh, probably.
You want a donut?

141
00:09:12,398 --> 00:09:13,729
No, thanks.

142
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,992
Okay.

143
00:09:18,538 --> 00:09:22,804
Dennis, stop it. Timmy!
Cut it out. Get over here.

144
00:09:25,478 --> 00:09:27,742
Okay, Dennis,
problem again?

145
00:09:27,814 --> 00:09:29,475
To make it pause
between sweeps.

146
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:31,449
Good.
And solution?

147
00:09:31,684 --> 00:09:34,312
Well, I guess we could
change the speed. Yeah.

148
00:09:34,387 --> 00:09:38,153
<i>Yeah, except it would be the wrong
approach and it wouldn't work.</i>

149
00:09:38,224 --> 00:09:39,486
What do I
always say?

150
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:40,958
<i>"Who farted?"</i>

151
00:09:41,027 --> 00:09:42,517
Besides that.

152
00:09:42,862 --> 00:09:44,625
Uh, look for
the unobvious.

153
00:09:44,697 --> 00:09:47,791
Yeah. So you do listen. All
right. Well, we're just looking

154
00:09:47,867 --> 00:09:49,095
for a measured,
consistent pause.

155
00:09:49,168 --> 00:09:50,760
Like your eye, right there. See that?

156
00:09:50,837 --> 00:09:52,964
The way it blinks
away a tear?

157
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,270
And we could try
a bimetallic timer

158
00:09:56,342 --> 00:09:58,503
that responds
to heat changes.

159
00:09:58,578 --> 00:10:01,376
But then, of course, what
do we do on a cold day?

160
00:10:01,447 --> 00:10:02,914
Put the ball down.
Sit down here.

161
00:10:02,982 --> 00:10:04,745
I want you to
put this together.

162
00:10:04,817 --> 00:10:08,514
I want you to solder this, all right?
Dennis, help him out. Get over here.

163
00:10:08,588 --> 00:10:12,080
Here we go. Here we go.
We got Team Kearns here!

164
00:10:12,425 --> 00:10:15,519
Yeah, this is hot, this is
hot. So, careful, all right?

165
00:10:15,595 --> 00:10:19,156
<i>That's got a transistor and a
capacitor, and resistors in there.</i>

166
00:10:19,232 --> 00:10:23,066
<i>That's as simple as I can get it.
That's when you get real beauty.</i>

167
00:10:23,136 --> 00:10:24,398
When less is more.

168
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,528
Will it work?

169
00:10:25,605 --> 00:10:26,902
It works up here
perfectly.

170
00:10:26,973 --> 00:10:30,568
We got resistors, each one
rated at a different tolerance.

171
00:10:30,643 --> 00:10:34,773
And each one should work in a wiper
motor. Where are the meter cords?

172
00:10:34,847 --> 00:10:36,712
Uh, just over there.

173
00:10:36,783 --> 00:10:40,082
<i>Of course, there's a thousand
different combinations.</i>

174
00:10:40,386 --> 00:10:42,820
Our job is to find
the one that works.

175
00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:45,619
And there is one
that'll work in theory.

176
00:10:46,626 --> 00:10:48,924
You know, Marconi spent seven
years trying to perfect the radio.

177
00:10:50,263 --> 00:10:52,629
Timmy, stop with
the ball, please!

178
00:11:07,413 --> 00:11:09,574
Well, what do you
know about that?

179
00:11:09,782 --> 00:11:11,545
One, two,
three, now!

180
00:11:12,151 --> 00:11:13,982
Wow!
One, two...

181
00:11:14,053 --> 00:11:16,783
<i>Honey, it's so great. It really works.</i>

182
00:11:16,856 --> 00:11:18,756
Two, three, now!

183
00:11:18,825 --> 00:11:20,588
<i>That's it,
it's going.</i>

184
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,288
<i>It's alive!</i>

185
00:11:23,596 --> 00:11:25,757
It moves!

186
00:11:25,832 --> 00:11:28,562
It pauses!

187
00:11:28,634 --> 00:11:32,695
<i>It's alive! Alive!
Alive! Alive!</i>

188
00:11:32,772 --> 00:11:34,535
What do you think?

189
00:11:34,607 --> 00:11:36,939
<i>Let's go out and
celebrate in real style.</i>

190
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,602
Really?
Yeah.

191
00:11:38,845 --> 00:11:40,938
<i>I'm gonna
buy a diamond ring.</i>

192
00:11:41,014 --> 00:11:42,675
Thank you, Peggy.
You're only six.

193
00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:45,047
You got a little ways to go,
sweetie. I got the burger, right?

194
00:11:45,118 --> 00:11:46,585
Can I have
some more Pepsi?

195
00:11:46,652 --> 00:11:47,676
Uh, me, too, please.

196
00:11:47,754 --> 00:11:48,914
<i>Sure, if your parents
say it's okay.</i>

197
00:11:48,988 --> 00:11:51,422
All right this time.
Did you get a pickle?

198
00:11:51,491 --> 00:11:53,118
You know why I wanted so many kids?

199
00:11:53,192 --> 00:11:56,628
Because I had six in my
family and you loved my family?

200
00:11:56,696 --> 00:11:59,130
True. I missed that growing up.

201
00:11:59,198 --> 00:12:01,598
I think you're
all caught up.

202
00:12:02,668 --> 00:12:05,193
Hey. Hey. Listen up!
Look at him. Look.

203
00:12:05,271 --> 00:12:07,705
<i>There's 20 million cars built
in this country every year,</i>

204
00:12:07,774 --> 00:12:09,241
and every one of them
is gonna need our wiper.

205
00:12:09,308 --> 00:12:10,605
Wow!
Huh?

206
00:12:10,676 --> 00:12:12,701
<i>And guess who's gonna
manufacture those.</i>

207
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:13,803
Who, Dad?

208
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,040
Us.

209
00:12:15,114 --> 00:12:16,274
We are?

210
00:12:16,349 --> 00:12:18,010
Yeah, we are.
In fact, here you go.

211
00:12:18,084 --> 00:12:22,180
I want to toast to the
Kearns Corporation right here

212
00:12:23,923 --> 00:12:26,016
And its board
of directors.

213
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,223
<i>Lou Galin's two weeks late
on that glass shipment.</i>

214
00:12:29,295 --> 00:12:30,387
What do you
want me to do?

215
00:12:30,463 --> 00:12:32,795
<i>Well, why don't you give
him a call? He's your buddy.</i>

216
00:12:32,865 --> 00:12:35,527
Did you pay him?
Yeah. Half.

217
00:12:36,102 --> 00:12:37,501
I'll call him.

218
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,670
<i>Well, that's the
damnedest thing.</i>

219
00:12:48,748 --> 00:12:49,908
Yeah.

220
00:12:49,982 --> 00:12:53,509
<i>Get this, it's also possible to build
a timing control into the wiper column</i>

221
00:12:53,586 --> 00:12:55,816
so that you could adjust
the time between movements.

222
00:12:55,888 --> 00:12:56,946
Well, why?

223
00:12:57,023 --> 00:12:59,583
Well, because it obviously rains
at different intensity levels.

224
00:12:59,659 --> 00:13:01,092
Yeah.
Right.

225
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,492
<i>That's part of
the whole idea.</i>

226
00:13:03,563 --> 00:13:04,825
What do you want
to do with it?

227
00:13:04,897 --> 00:13:06,558
Well, Bob wants
to manufacture it.

228
00:13:06,632 --> 00:13:09,294
So from our end, we just put
up the dough for the patents,

229
00:13:09,368 --> 00:13:11,529
research and development, all
of which goes through Kearns,

230
00:13:11,604 --> 00:13:14,334
and we also seed the
money for manufacturing.

231
00:13:14,407 --> 00:13:16,068
And I could be ready
to go very soon.

232
00:13:16,142 --> 00:13:18,770
<i>Yeah, it's a pretty
simple deal. The fact is,</i>

233
00:13:18,845 --> 00:13:22,941
if we can nail a quarter of cars
in America at, what, 50 bucks a pop?

234
00:13:23,015 --> 00:13:24,073
Think about it.

235
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:27,051
Just curious, do you have any
manufacturing experience, Mr. Kearns?

236
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,918
Inventing, with all due respect,
is one thing, but building is...

237
00:13:29,989 --> 00:13:32,287
<i>Well, Bob's background's in
engineering, so I don't see how...</i>

238
00:13:32,358 --> 00:13:34,451
<i>Gil, Gil, let Bob talk,
for Christ's sake.</i>

239
00:13:34,527 --> 00:13:37,360
Right, right. Bob?
Yeah, um...

240
00:13:38,764 --> 00:13:41,790
Well, no actual experience, no, not yet.

241
00:13:41,868 --> 00:13:45,599
<i>But, uh... Look, I know I'm
not your ordinary businessman.</i>

242
00:13:45,671 --> 00:13:46,660
<i>I don't have
an MBA, but...</i>

243
00:13:46,739 --> 00:13:48,969
No apologies, Bob.
You're doing great.

244
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,565
We'll hold his hand
the whole time.

245
00:13:50,643 --> 00:13:53,237
<i>It's not gonna be a
problem. Yeah, it's a bet.</i>

246
00:13:53,312 --> 00:13:56,543
But so was the kidney
machine that keeps Dad alive.

247
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:59,851
Barely alive. What
are you gonna call it?

248
00:14:00,653 --> 00:14:02,883
The Kearns Blinking
Eye Wiper.

249
00:14:04,757 --> 00:14:08,386
<i>Yeah. Well, I'm not
sure about the name.</i>

250
00:14:10,062 --> 00:14:11,723
You look sensational, hon.

251
00:14:11,797 --> 00:14:13,094
Thanks.

252
00:14:13,866 --> 00:14:15,629
You're a little
nervous, huh?

253
00:14:15,701 --> 00:14:17,100
<i>Aren't you?</i>

254
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,228
No.

255
00:14:24,944 --> 00:14:26,844
Welcome, ma'am.
Thanks.

256
00:14:28,014 --> 00:14:29,504
Welcome, sir.

257
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:32,008
Sir? Here you go.

258
00:14:35,454 --> 00:14:37,388
Funny, we've never been
inside here before.

259
00:14:37,456 --> 00:14:39,583
Oh, yeah. I never
thought about it.

260
00:14:39,659 --> 00:14:41,524
Well, start thinking
about it.

261
00:14:41,594 --> 00:14:44,085
I want to be able to take
you to more places like this.

262
00:14:44,163 --> 00:14:45,425
Okay.

263
00:14:45,498 --> 00:14:48,865
No, really. This is a big
deal. Start of a new life.

264
00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:52,060
You gonna quit teaching?

265
00:14:52,838 --> 00:14:54,601
You think I should?

266
00:14:54,907 --> 00:14:57,671
I think you should take
it a step at a time.

267
00:14:57,743 --> 00:14:59,438
<i>Oh, so you're saying
it's not gonna last.</i>

268
00:14:59,512 --> 00:15:02,003
<i>No! I'm saying I'll love you either way.</i>

269
00:15:02,081 --> 00:15:04,345
<i>Which is French for
"be prepared to fail. "</i>

270
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:05,907
Robert!
No.

271
00:15:05,985 --> 00:15:08,180
I just want to do
something important.

272
00:15:08,254 --> 00:15:09,585
You will.

273
00:15:10,423 --> 00:15:11,788
Will you love me
more if I do?

274
00:15:11,857 --> 00:15:14,519
No. I'll love you
more if you're rich.

275
00:15:15,962 --> 00:15:19,363
I married a gold digger.
What do you know about that?

276
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:22,667
Oh, I just...
They're driving me crazy.

277
00:15:22,735 --> 00:15:25,169
<i>They don't want to go to
the rec center anymore,</i>

278
00:15:25,238 --> 00:15:28,036
and at least when school starts,
that takes care of four of them.

279
00:15:28,107 --> 00:15:31,599
And then we've just got
the two little ones at home,

280
00:15:31,677 --> 00:15:33,542
but we have fun.

281
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,578
Well, ours are up at Harbor
Springs. They just love it up there.

282
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:39,140
<i>Oh, I bet! But you don't go with them?</i>

283
00:15:39,218 --> 00:15:41,982
<i>Well, that's the problem. It's
just hard to find time to get away.</i>

284
00:15:42,054 --> 00:15:44,284
<i>Right, Bob? They think it's
like summer camp up there.</i>

285
00:15:44,357 --> 00:15:45,824
<i>I don't even think they
notice we're not there.</i>

286
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:46,949
Mmm.

287
00:15:49,996 --> 00:15:52,726
<i>Do you see Robert's eye?
Yeah, is that bothering you?</i>

288
00:15:52,798 --> 00:15:55,062
<i>No. Do you know the
story of Robert's eye?</i>

289
00:15:55,134 --> 00:15:57,068
Oh, Phyll, Phyll, forget it.
The story of our wedding night?

290
00:15:57,136 --> 00:15:59,468
<i>It's such a funny
story, honey!</i>

291
00:16:00,172 --> 00:16:01,662
<i>So, it's our
wedding night,</i>

292
00:16:01,741 --> 00:16:04,266
<i>and I'm getting ready in the bathroom</i>

293
00:16:04,343 --> 00:16:05,537
and putting on my
little negligee.

294
00:16:05,611 --> 00:16:07,203
Okay, okay, okay!

295
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,875
<i>And Robert's in the next room,
opening a bottle of champagne.</i>

296
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:12,542
<i>Well, I'd never
opened one before.</i>

297
00:16:12,618 --> 00:16:15,178
Figures. Bob had never opened a bottle
of champagne before his wedding night.

298
00:16:15,254 --> 00:16:19,384
So I had it down between my
legs, and I look down and, pow!

299
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,358
Cork goes off
right in my eye,

300
00:16:21,427 --> 00:16:23,793
and I fall back on the
sheets. I was bleeding.

301
00:16:23,863 --> 00:16:24,921
I come out and
start screaming.

302
00:16:24,997 --> 00:16:26,862
<i>Screaming bloody murder, Phyllis.
I don't know what's happened.</i>

303
00:16:26,932 --> 00:16:28,263
But it all
turned out okay

304
00:16:28,334 --> 00:16:29,460
and he made it
up to me later.

305
00:16:29,535 --> 00:16:30,593
Hey, hey!

306
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,365
<i>Good evening, everyone.
My name is Joe Warwick,</i>

307
00:16:32,438 --> 00:16:34,303
<i>and I'm the guy who leaned
on you to come out tonight.</i>

308
00:16:34,373 --> 00:16:36,238
<i>And I'm glad I did.</i>

309
00:16:36,409 --> 00:16:39,003
<i>I want you to give yourselves
a big hand, because tonight,</i>

310
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:42,047
<i>we raised $11,000 for
the Children's Hospital.</i>

311
00:16:42,782 --> 00:16:46,980
<i>Now, let's do some more dancing
to the sound of the Telegraph Five!</i>

312
00:16:48,821 --> 00:16:50,482
<i>Hey, let's dance.
No.</i>

313
00:16:50,556 --> 00:16:52,581
<i>It's okay, it's okay, come
on. No, Phyllis. Phyllis.</i>

314
00:16:52,658 --> 00:16:53,852
Come on.

315
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:06,102
Hey. Say, Bob. Phyllis, you look lovely.

316
00:17:06,172 --> 00:17:09,835
Would you mind if Gil and I dragged
Bob outside for some business chat?

317
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:11,968
Where we can hear
ourselves think.

318
00:17:12,044 --> 00:17:13,238
Go on.

319
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:18,881
We've got some real
interesting news for you.

320
00:17:20,219 --> 00:17:22,153
Paul, when are they gonna
fix that seventeenth green?

321
00:17:22,221 --> 00:17:23,210
<i>I'm tired of playing
on that temporary green.</i>

322
00:17:23,289 --> 00:17:25,985
<i>I'm on it, I'm on it. I took it to
the board. It'll get taken care of.</i>

323
00:17:26,058 --> 00:17:27,787
<i>Bob, you don't play
golf, do you?</i>

324
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,487
Uh, no, no.

325
00:17:30,896 --> 00:17:34,024
So, Bob, we got some really
good feedback on the feelers

326
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,567
we put out for
the Blinking Eye.

327
00:17:35,634 --> 00:17:38,194
<i>Yeah, it turns out the concept
isn't as unique as we first thought.</i>

328
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,431
The Big Three have assigned
their windshield wiper teams

329
00:17:40,506 --> 00:17:42,337
to come up with an
intermittent wiper.

330
00:17:42,408 --> 00:17:45,275
<i>That's what they call it.
The Intermittent Wiper.</i>

331
00:17:45,344 --> 00:17:48,211
The Intermittent Wiper.
I'll be damned.

332
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,977
<i>No, it's fine. More than anything,
now we know there's a demand for it.</i>

333
00:17:52,051 --> 00:17:54,576
Until now, your wiper
seemed like a clever gadget.

334
00:17:54,653 --> 00:17:58,646
<i>But they want it. And more importantly,
they haven't cracked it yet.</i>

335
00:17:58,724 --> 00:18:02,057
<i>Mercury's been working on one for over
a year and they still haven't beaten it.</i>

336
00:18:02,128 --> 00:18:03,959
So we want to set up
a demonstration.

337
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:06,088
Now, Ford is very interested
in seeing what we have.

338
00:18:06,165 --> 00:18:07,291
Ford?

339
00:18:09,668 --> 00:18:10,930
<i>You didn't mention
anything about...</i>

340
00:18:11,003 --> 00:18:12,527
Are you ready?

341
00:18:13,372 --> 00:18:14,805
Wow, Ford. Wow.

342
00:18:14,874 --> 00:18:17,274
<i>I don't know. I mean,
it needs some more work.</i>

343
00:18:17,343 --> 00:18:18,367
More consistency.

344
00:18:18,444 --> 00:18:21,242
<i>I can assure you we won't
sell it if we don't show it.</i>

345
00:18:21,313 --> 00:18:24,680
Yeah, but should we be showing them ours if
they're already working on their own version?

346
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,774
<i>Well, that's
up to you.</i>

347
00:18:25,851 --> 00:18:29,309
<i>But maybe it's a good reason
to show it sooner than later.</i>

348
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:31,518
<i>I don't know, Gil.</i>

349
00:18:32,191 --> 00:18:35,251
<i>Kearns, I'd hate to see
you if you got bad news.</i>

350
00:18:35,594 --> 00:18:37,061
We're not gonna let
anybody take it apart,

351
00:18:37,129 --> 00:18:38,756
especially after the money
we've put into the patents.

352
00:18:38,831 --> 00:18:42,232
We'll just give them a
peek. Cat stays in the bag.

353
00:18:54,046 --> 00:18:55,707
<i>Now, Paul's real
excited about this.</i>

354
00:18:55,781 --> 00:18:58,409
<i>In fact, I haven't seen him
quite like that in a long time.</i>

355
00:18:58,484 --> 00:19:00,349
Well, I got
a lot to do.

356
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:03,650
No, I know, know. By
the way, this is yours.

357
00:19:05,958 --> 00:19:07,186
Mine?

358
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:09,659
For now. No more
aquariums, Bob.

359
00:19:10,196 --> 00:19:13,324
Just throw the unit in
here and take it to Ford.

360
00:19:14,934 --> 00:19:15,992
Sal!

361
00:19:16,469 --> 00:19:18,767
Sal here'll help
you put it in.

362
00:19:19,505 --> 00:19:22,065
Just tell us what you want, Mr. Kearns.

363
00:19:22,675 --> 00:19:23,664
Okay.

364
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,483
He'll be here.

365
00:20:06,552 --> 00:20:08,986
We're very busy
here, Mr. Previck.

366
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:13,217
This is him, yeah?
Yeah.

367
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,463
Hiya, Bob.
Hey, Gil.

368
00:20:24,136 --> 00:20:26,195
Frank Sertin, Vice President
of Research and Development,

369
00:20:26,272 --> 00:20:27,261
meet Bob Kearns,

370
00:20:27,339 --> 00:20:29,705
the inventor of the
Intermittent Windshield Wiper.

371
00:20:29,775 --> 00:20:31,675
Oh, we'll see. We'll see.

372
00:20:31,744 --> 00:20:34,008
<i>It's a real pleasure.
Good. Thank you.</i>

373
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:35,842
<i>All right, Bob, let's see what you got.</i>

374
00:20:35,915 --> 00:20:37,007
All right.
And, Bob!

375
00:20:37,082 --> 00:20:38,481
We want you to do it
with the engine running.

376
00:20:38,551 --> 00:20:43,250
We've found that the heat can play havoc
with some of the systems we've tried.

377
00:20:45,157 --> 00:20:46,522
Right now?

378
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:48,458
Right now.

379
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,935
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where... Where's he going?</i>

380
00:21:03,008 --> 00:21:05,340
<i>Bob's real
big on security.</i>

381
00:21:07,746 --> 00:21:09,111
Okay.

382
00:21:09,582 --> 00:21:12,676
Okay, Bob!
Come on, let her rip!

383
00:21:40,512 --> 00:21:42,776
<i>What's going on?
I don't know.</i>

384
00:21:44,049 --> 00:21:45,175
Okay.

385
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,342
Bob?

386
00:21:46,418 --> 00:21:47,715
<i>I don't know.</i>

387
00:21:52,691 --> 00:21:53,749
Okay.

388
00:21:55,961 --> 00:21:57,223
Bob!
Yeah?

389
00:21:57,296 --> 00:21:59,287
<i>Oh, here! It's a fuse.</i>

390
00:21:59,365 --> 00:22:01,424
<i>It's the fuse.
It's a fuse!</i>

391
00:22:02,635 --> 00:22:04,330
Yeah, we're good.

392
00:22:13,979 --> 00:22:17,210
It'll do that all day,
engine running or not.

393
00:22:18,384 --> 00:22:20,545
Well, that is...

394
00:22:22,988 --> 00:22:24,580
<i>That's good.</i>

395
00:22:24,657 --> 00:22:26,716
<i>We call this
"variable speed. "</i>

396
00:22:26,792 --> 00:22:28,316
Variable speed.

397
00:22:37,036 --> 00:22:38,594
<i>"Variable dwell. "</i>

398
00:22:39,805 --> 00:22:41,796
That is very
impressive.

399
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,966
Gil, how about giving us a
little look under the hood, huh?

400
00:22:45,044 --> 00:22:47,308
<i>Sorry, Frank,
we can't do that.</i>

401
00:22:48,147 --> 00:22:50,615
<i>He's not doing that manually, is he?</i>

402
00:22:54,019 --> 00:22:56,044
Bob? Bob!

403
00:22:57,389 --> 00:22:59,448
Uh, would you get
out of the car?

404
00:22:59,525 --> 00:23:02,460
They think you might be
manipulating the controls.

405
00:23:02,528 --> 00:23:03,995
Well, I am.

406
00:23:14,306 --> 00:23:15,534
That is very
good, Bob.

407
00:23:15,607 --> 00:23:17,097
That is very,
very good.

408
00:23:17,176 --> 00:23:19,508
I think we should get
you a copy of our specs.

409
00:23:19,578 --> 00:23:22,046
But I can tell you this, though.
At a minimum, at a minimum,

410
00:23:22,114 --> 00:23:23,775
<i>it's gonna have to run a
million and a half cycles</i>

411
00:23:23,849 --> 00:23:25,214
under real-time
conditions.

412
00:23:25,284 --> 00:23:27,149
And operate...
Uh, excuse me.

413
00:23:27,219 --> 00:23:29,244
<i>What's the maximum
temperature under the hood?</i>

414
00:23:29,321 --> 00:23:31,789
It's, uh... Two hundred
and seventy degrees.

415
00:23:31,857 --> 00:23:33,085
Mmm-hmm.

416
00:23:34,326 --> 00:23:37,955
If it operates in the
field like it did here...

417
00:23:38,731 --> 00:23:39,925
<i>Where'd you get
your degree?</i>

418
00:23:39,998 --> 00:23:41,625
Uh, Case Western.

419
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:43,794
<i>I'm gonna look
under the hood.</i>

420
00:23:43,869 --> 00:23:44,893
<i>Sorry, we'd rather not.</i>

421
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:48,963
<i>It's nothing against Ford, sir. I've
admired the company my whole life.</i>

422
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:50,065
No problem.

423
00:23:50,142 --> 00:23:52,508
But I'll get to work right away,
just as soon as I get the specs.

424
00:23:52,578 --> 00:23:53,567
Okay, good, good.

425
00:23:53,645 --> 00:23:56,136
Listen, I know that we are
gonna be in touch with you.

426
00:23:56,215 --> 00:23:58,080
Yes, sir.
Very good. Gil.

427
00:23:58,150 --> 00:23:59,344
Frank.

428
00:24:00,886 --> 00:24:03,480
Dr. Kearns?
Case Western.

429
00:24:03,555 --> 00:24:05,989
<i>That's a...
That's a good school.</i>

430
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:25,503
Get out of the car.
Get out of the car.

431
00:24:30,716 --> 00:24:32,980
You did a hell
of a job, pal.

432
00:24:34,186 --> 00:24:35,915
Hell of a job.

433
00:24:36,355 --> 00:24:37,617
Thank you.

434
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:40,014
I'll see you.

435
00:24:46,131 --> 00:24:47,462
<i>Well, there's
a difference between</i>

436
00:24:47,533 --> 00:24:49,330
a good idea and
a good product.

437
00:24:49,401 --> 00:24:51,494
I've had a lot
of good ideas.

438
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:54,505
<i>Just nothing that's quite
clicked, you know?</i>

439
00:24:54,973 --> 00:24:58,067
It makes you wonder what it
is makes a man successful.

440
00:24:58,143 --> 00:24:59,337
Brains?

441
00:25:00,045 --> 00:25:01,273
Talent?

442
00:25:01,847 --> 00:25:06,284
<i>Of course, there's a lot of unsuccessful
talents running around out there.</i>

443
00:25:08,053 --> 00:25:09,918
Maybe this is the one.

444
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:14,623
Maybe this'll get you where
you want to be, you know?

445
00:25:15,327 --> 00:25:16,624
Yeah.

446
00:25:17,262 --> 00:25:21,221
<i>But I don't know. I look at you
and I look at us and I just think</i>

447
00:25:23,735 --> 00:25:26,568
<i>you're a success.
Don't you feel that way?</i>

448
00:25:28,507 --> 00:25:30,304
<i>Maybe it's some
other thing.</i>

449
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:33,037
Like luck, timing.

450
00:25:36,014 --> 00:25:38,278
Some intangible
thing like that.

451
00:25:40,252 --> 00:25:42,117
It haunts me a little.

452
00:25:46,658 --> 00:25:48,285
<i>I'm gonna get some more
tea. Do you want anything?</i>

453
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,453
<i>No, I'm good.
No? Okay.</i>

454
00:25:53,999 --> 00:25:56,627
I explained it to her,
and then she just, like...

455
00:25:56,702 --> 00:25:58,294
Patrick, come on
with that paper!

456
00:25:58,370 --> 00:25:59,997
<i>I'm good,
I got it!</i>

457
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,641
<i>Okay, it's Tuesday,
"Cold, clear and sunny.</i>

458
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:07,074
<i>"Wednesday,
clear and warmer. "</i>

459
00:26:07,145 --> 00:26:08,669
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, give it back!

460
00:26:08,747 --> 00:26:09,771
Let him have it.

461
00:26:09,848 --> 00:26:11,611
Okay, "Thursday, clear.

462
00:26:11,683 --> 00:26:16,017
<i>"Friday, partly cloudy and
colder, and a clearing on Sunday. "</i>

463
00:26:16,154 --> 00:26:17,712
Well, we
need some rain.

464
00:26:17,789 --> 00:26:20,451
Maybe instead of grace, we
should say a prayer, Dad.

465
00:26:20,525 --> 00:26:22,550
<i>Didn't we just say grace already? Yeah.</i>

466
00:26:22,628 --> 00:26:25,825
<i>No, no, that's okay. That's
okay. Let's do that. Come on.</i>

467
00:26:25,898 --> 00:26:29,356
<i>Let's do a little prayer here, huh? When you
say a prayer, you're supposed to fold your hands.</i>

468
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:33,268
Dear God, thank you for all the
sunshine you've been sending.

469
00:26:33,972 --> 00:26:36,099
We know in your
infinite wisdom,

470
00:26:36,174 --> 00:26:39,666
you managed to create the elasticity
of rain water different than tap.

471
00:26:39,745 --> 00:26:41,042
If you could see it
in your good graces

472
00:26:41,113 --> 00:26:44,549
to, you know,
send us some rain

473
00:26:44,616 --> 00:26:47,346
so that we can test the Blinking
Eye in real-life conditions,

474
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:49,649
<i>we'd appreciate it.
Amen.</i>

475
00:26:49,888 --> 00:26:50,912
Amen.

476
00:26:50,989 --> 00:26:52,684
Do you think he heard you, Daddy?

477
00:26:52,758 --> 00:26:54,350
<i>My luck,
he's a G.M. Man.</i>

478
00:26:57,496 --> 00:26:58,724
Go, go, go!

479
00:26:58,797 --> 00:27:02,198
Careful! Dennis, in the
back! Maureen, be careful!

480
00:27:14,813 --> 00:27:17,247
<i>And it's working, too.
Watch that, watch that.</i>

481
00:27:18,884 --> 00:27:21,648
I can adjust the speed,
too. I can adjust it.

482
00:27:43,575 --> 00:27:44,906
Look at that.
Yeah.

483
00:27:44,977 --> 00:27:46,467
Perfect.
That was awesome.

484
00:27:46,545 --> 00:27:48,843
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, you see
that car across the street?

485
00:27:48,914 --> 00:27:51,405
<i>Oh, yeah. Look at the driver.
He's staring right at us.</i>

486
00:27:51,483 --> 00:27:54,316
<i>He thinks I'm turning the wiper on
and off here. You think he can tell?</i>

487
00:27:54,386 --> 00:27:56,820
Look at this. No, no!
Look here.

488
00:27:56,888 --> 00:28:01,222
<i>Look at that, mister. No hands! He's
wondering what the heck's going on!</i>

489
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,752
<i>How's he doing that?</i>

490
00:28:02,828 --> 00:28:04,489
No hands.
Hi.

491
00:28:04,563 --> 00:28:06,997
How the heck are
they doing that?

492
00:28:09,501 --> 00:28:11,969
<i>We got ourselves a winner here, I'd say.</i>

493
00:28:12,971 --> 00:28:14,461
Ford Motor Company.
How can I help you?

494
00:28:14,539 --> 00:28:15,699
<i>What's the deal?</i>

495
00:28:15,774 --> 00:28:18,641
<i>Well, he's got it, and
it really seems to work.</i>

496
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,337
And you've gone
through it completely?

497
00:28:20,412 --> 00:28:22,539
As close as we could
from a distance.

498
00:28:22,614 --> 00:28:24,605
<i>He hasn't actually
let us do any surgery.</i>

499
00:28:24,683 --> 00:28:25,843
Why not?

500
00:28:25,917 --> 00:28:27,714
<i>He's nervous about
people getting too close.</i>

501
00:28:27,786 --> 00:28:30,880
Mack, he is a particular kinda guy.

502
00:28:31,623 --> 00:28:33,853
Well, whatever. We gotta
get this puppy moving.

503
00:28:33,925 --> 00:28:37,258
<i>The marketing department's all over me.
They think they can sell the shit out of it.</i>

504
00:28:37,329 --> 00:28:38,921
<i>What's he want?</i>

505
00:28:40,198 --> 00:28:41,392
To build it.

506
00:28:41,466 --> 00:28:43,457
He wants to manufacture it? Himself?

507
00:28:43,535 --> 00:28:45,867
<i>Apparently, that's
his dream, yeah.</i>

508
00:28:45,937 --> 00:28:48,838
Okay, well, we'll deal with that later.

509
00:28:48,907 --> 00:28:51,603
Right now we need
to get him on board.

510
00:28:52,144 --> 00:28:53,270
Okay.

511
00:28:57,315 --> 00:29:00,216
Come on in, guys.
Bob, Dick Gordon.

512
00:29:00,285 --> 00:29:02,344
There you go.
Nice to see you again.

513
00:29:04,389 --> 00:29:06,584
Gil, nice to
see you again.

514
00:29:06,658 --> 00:29:08,387
You, too, Macklin.

515
00:29:09,628 --> 00:29:11,095
This is
Dr. Bob Kearns.

516
00:29:11,163 --> 00:29:14,655
Bob Kearns, winner of the
wiper competition. Congrats.

517
00:29:14,733 --> 00:29:18,794
Bob, I've been going over the reports on your
Intermittent. It looks like you cracked it.

518
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:20,030
Have you worked up
a unit price yet?

519
00:29:20,105 --> 00:29:22,471
<i>No. Not yet.
I'm hoping to...</i>

520
00:29:22,541 --> 00:29:24,441
Good. And you do want
to manufacture it?

521
00:29:24,509 --> 00:29:27,239
Yes, sir. I want to
come through for Ford.

522
00:29:27,312 --> 00:29:30,475
<i>And we like that. So let's
get a unit price, then.</i>

523
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:33,416
Frank, have you sent a
working unit to Washington?

524
00:29:33,485 --> 00:29:37,387
<i>No, Mack, we haven't. Bob's...
He's not comfortable with that.</i>

525
00:29:37,456 --> 00:29:38,650
Really?

526
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,949
Now, Bob, you do understand
this is a safety device.

527
00:29:41,026 --> 00:29:44,427
And before we can install any
safety device on any of our cars,

528
00:29:44,496 --> 00:29:46,555
we have to submit it to
Washington for approval.

529
00:29:46,631 --> 00:29:48,792
And that means we're gonna
need a working unit from you.

530
00:29:48,867 --> 00:29:52,667
I understand that. And I understand
I'll need your cars for my wipers.

531
00:29:53,872 --> 00:29:55,703
But I thought that,
uh, if we had a...

532
00:29:55,774 --> 00:29:57,639
We like to work closely
with our people, Bob.

533
00:29:57,709 --> 00:29:59,768
<i>That's...
That's the deal.</i>

534
00:29:59,845 --> 00:30:01,642
<i>Nothing else would make sense.
I'm sure Gil will tell you that</i>

535
00:30:01,713 --> 00:30:04,273
we have a very close relationship
with Previck Automotive.

536
00:30:04,349 --> 00:30:07,147
<i>Bob knows that. That's
why we came here first.</i>

537
00:30:07,219 --> 00:30:09,312
<i>He's right, though, Bob.
It does need to be approved.</i>

538
00:30:09,387 --> 00:30:12,584
We're interested in offering the
Intermittent as an option on at least

539
00:30:12,657 --> 00:30:16,423
one model next year. From there, our
plan is to expand it to the entire line.

540
00:30:16,495 --> 00:30:19,931
Now, that means we're working
under a serious deadline.

541
00:30:19,998 --> 00:30:23,490
So we're gonna need a unit
from you as fast as possible.

542
00:30:23,702 --> 00:30:26,762
Okay. Yeah,
I can do that.

543
00:30:26,838 --> 00:30:27,930
Great.

544
00:30:28,006 --> 00:30:29,439
<i>Let's get started on
the legal right away.</i>

545
00:30:29,508 --> 00:30:30,497
Right, gentlemen?
Absolutely.

546
00:30:30,575 --> 00:30:32,907
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

547
00:30:32,978 --> 00:30:35,538
I'll get my demo and
research over to Mr. Sertin.

548
00:30:35,614 --> 00:30:39,311
<i>Excellent. This is what it's all
about, Bob. Corporate "can do. "</i>

549
00:30:39,384 --> 00:30:40,976
How about that?

550
00:30:44,289 --> 00:30:47,986
<i>Now, remember. There's a right way
and a wrong way to do this, okay?</i>

551
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:50,391
<i>Whatever you do, don't let
them think that it's perfect.</i>

552
00:30:50,462 --> 00:30:51,690
But what if it is?

553
00:30:51,763 --> 00:30:52,923
Hey, listen to
your father now.

554
00:30:52,998 --> 00:30:54,932
<i>Here, you wanna take him?
No, I'm serious about this.</i>

555
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,558
Be very careful
what you say, okay?

556
00:30:56,635 --> 00:30:59,729
The moment they think they got a
sucker in the line, you're dead.

557
00:30:59,804 --> 00:31:01,465
Here he comes.

558
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:04,441
Just everybody take it easy. Let
him come to us a little bit, okay?

559
00:31:04,509 --> 00:31:06,602
We'll be fine.
Let me do the talking.

560
00:31:06,678 --> 00:31:07,702
<i>What's
new about that?</i>

561
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:09,906
Hey! No back talk.
Come here.

562
00:31:10,649 --> 00:31:11,946
Michael?
Hi.

563
00:31:12,017 --> 00:31:13,951
How are you? Bob Kearns.
Nice to meet you, Bob.

564
00:31:19,024 --> 00:31:20,048
How big is it?

565
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:21,592
Thirty thousand
square feet.

566
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:24,652
Structurally, this is as sound as
any building you'll find in Detroit.

567
00:31:24,729 --> 00:31:27,789
The loading ramps are more than
ample for any job you may have.

568
00:31:27,866 --> 00:31:29,493
Sure looks like it
needs a lot of work.

569
00:31:29,568 --> 00:31:32,002
We're concerned about the
price. Is it the best you can do?

570
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:35,369
Well, we can probably work out an eight
cents per foot improvement, Mrs. Kearns.

571
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,135
What do you think, guys?
How much is it?

572
00:31:37,209 --> 00:31:38,972
Fifty cents
a square foot.

573
00:31:39,044 --> 00:31:42,013
No. No, we were figuring
on a lot less than that.

574
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,571
I think the owners
might come down a bit.

575
00:31:44,649 --> 00:31:47,379
Well, we'll have to think about it. Hey!

576
00:31:47,452 --> 00:31:49,511
You hear that echo?
This place is solid!

577
00:31:49,588 --> 00:31:53,388
<i>It's perfect, Michael.
Absolutely perfect! I love it.</i>

578
00:31:58,964 --> 00:31:59,988
<i>It's such
a simple idea.</i>

579
00:32:00,065 --> 00:32:03,330
<i>I'm amazed no one's cracked it
before. Where did you do your research?</i>

580
00:32:03,401 --> 00:32:04,891
My basement.

581
00:32:05,604 --> 00:32:08,698
So, these S.D. 25s
are fixed costs?

582
00:32:08,773 --> 00:32:11,742
Yes, we can do a discount
after 400,000 units.

583
00:32:12,344 --> 00:32:15,939
I assume you'll put the Ford contracts up
against costs. They're backing it, right?

584
00:32:16,014 --> 00:32:19,074
Oh, yeah. We're down the road on
all that. My biggest concern is

585
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,515
that you'll be able
to provide us with

586
00:32:20,585 --> 00:32:23,349
the necessary transistors
and circuits that we need.

587
00:32:23,421 --> 00:32:27,118
Mr. Kearns, Motorola is the biggest
electronics manufacturer in the world.

588
00:32:27,192 --> 00:32:30,628
I think if we can supply the
Pentagon, we can supply you.

589
00:32:30,695 --> 00:32:32,219
The who?
The...

590
00:32:32,864 --> 00:32:35,526
<i>That's a good one.</i>

591
00:32:45,076 --> 00:32:46,566
Hiya, Bob.
Hi.

592
00:32:47,212 --> 00:32:51,706
The gentleman at Motorola put me in
touch with their finance department.

593
00:32:51,783 --> 00:32:53,614
Yeah. Yeah. Bob?

594
00:32:53,685 --> 00:32:56,449
<i>No, I'm serious about this. We
should talk about cash flows...</i>

595
00:32:56,521 --> 00:32:57,954
Want me to take your order? Yes.

596
00:32:58,023 --> 00:33:00,218
Actually, do you mind
giving us a second?

597
00:33:00,292 --> 00:33:01,919
Sure.
Thanks, hon.

598
00:33:01,993 --> 00:33:03,790
<i>Sorry, I'm starving.</i>

599
00:33:07,766 --> 00:33:09,290
They want out, Bob.

600
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:11,130
Who wants out?
Ford.

601
00:33:14,105 --> 00:33:15,094
What?

602
00:33:15,173 --> 00:33:17,198
They're just not
interested anymore.

603
00:33:17,275 --> 00:33:21,143
Wait, wait, what... What do
you mean? Well... What happened?

604
00:33:21,212 --> 00:33:22,406
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

605
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,538
Well, who did
you talk to?

606
00:33:23,615 --> 00:33:25,606
Tyler. Yeah.
Macklin?

607
00:33:25,684 --> 00:33:27,015
What did he
say exactly?

608
00:33:27,085 --> 00:33:28,518
Like I said,
they want out.

609
00:33:28,586 --> 00:33:29,575
Out?

610
00:33:29,654 --> 00:33:32,384
They're not ready yet, and they're
not gonna make a move until they are.

611
00:33:32,457 --> 00:33:35,893
<i>They gave me a line like, you
know, "It's not the Ford style. "</i>

612
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,928
Out, or ready, Gil?
Which one is it?

613
00:33:37,996 --> 00:33:40,464
<i>Hang on a second.
I'm in this, too.</i>

614
00:33:43,001 --> 00:33:44,093
They have the unit.

615
00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:45,602
We'll get it back.
When?

616
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:46,659
<i>I don't know.</i>

617
00:33:46,738 --> 00:33:48,467
I closed on the
operating loan.

618
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,667
<i>Well, don't forget, I thought
you should slow down on that.</i>

619
00:33:50,742 --> 00:33:51,766
They're loading
in transistors.

620
00:33:51,843 --> 00:33:54,107
We're gonna figure this out. All
we gotta do is take it to another...

621
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:55,441
Bullshit.

622
00:34:00,085 --> 00:34:02,519
Listen. Chrysler,
A.M.C., G. M...

623
00:34:02,587 --> 00:34:05,055
<i>My kids. It's my kids.</i>

624
00:34:05,357 --> 00:34:09,088
Ford was our best bet. We both
know that. But we're not done.

625
00:34:09,594 --> 00:34:12,427
Okay, but they... They strung us
along, and they looked at my work.

626
00:34:12,497 --> 00:34:13,691
I know.

627
00:34:14,499 --> 00:34:15,761
I know.

628
00:34:15,834 --> 00:34:17,301
We had a deal.

629
00:34:18,036 --> 00:34:19,765
I think they might be
negotiating here, Gil.

630
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:21,430
No. They're not.

631
00:34:22,207 --> 00:34:24,141
You sure? Because I haven't... Yeah.

632
00:34:24,209 --> 00:34:26,074
<i>It's dead there, Bob.</i>

633
00:34:29,013 --> 00:34:30,207
My God.

634
00:34:53,338 --> 00:34:57,900
All the boxes are going in the
cage until you know where they go!

635
00:35:23,701 --> 00:35:26,226
Professor Kearns.
Find what you want?

636
00:35:26,738 --> 00:35:28,603
Yes, Louis, thanks.

637
00:35:28,673 --> 00:35:31,369
<i>"State Highway System:
History and Facts. "</i>

638
00:35:31,443 --> 00:35:32,501
This for one of
your classes?

639
00:35:32,577 --> 00:35:36,877
<i>No, I'm just doing some work for the
state, analyzing pavement erosion.</i>

640
00:35:36,981 --> 00:35:38,039
Nothing too exciting.

641
00:35:38,116 --> 00:35:40,016
Yeah, but they're paying
you to come up with stuff.

642
00:35:40,084 --> 00:35:44,384
<i>Sounds pretty good to me. You know,
I'm sort of a amateur idea man myself.</i>

643
00:35:44,456 --> 00:35:47,220
<i>A few of us even have
an inventors' club.</i>

644
00:35:47,292 --> 00:35:49,852
Maybe I can call you sometime,
ask you some questions.

645
00:35:49,928 --> 00:35:51,293
Absolutely.

646
00:36:39,611 --> 00:36:43,172
Hey, you guys are late. Take
it around the back entrance.

647
00:37:09,007 --> 00:37:12,272
Have your invitations
out and ready, please.

648
00:37:12,944 --> 00:37:15,071
Hey, folks,
welcome to Ford.

649
00:37:17,916 --> 00:37:21,147
Got your invitation, sir?
Yeah. Right here.

650
00:37:21,219 --> 00:37:22,481
There are
tons of options.

651
00:37:22,554 --> 00:37:25,318
<i>Excuse me, sir. Please
don't touch the car.</i>

652
00:37:27,926 --> 00:37:29,951
It comes with Select Air air
conditioning in all the models,

653
00:37:30,028 --> 00:37:31,052
and many options
are available.

654
00:37:31,129 --> 00:37:32,289
What about the tires?

655
00:37:32,363 --> 00:37:34,854
Oh, beautiful
Magnum 500 wheels...

656
00:37:37,936 --> 00:37:39,665
<i>Go, go, go, go!</i>

657
00:37:39,737 --> 00:37:41,466
<i>Come on and fly with me</i>

658
00:37:41,539 --> 00:37:43,473
<i>Go, go, go, go!</i>

659
00:37:43,541 --> 00:37:45,065
<i>And take a drive with me</i>

660
00:37:45,143 --> 00:37:46,974
<i>Go, go, go, go!</i>

661
00:37:47,045 --> 00:37:51,004
<i>And try a Ford with me
Don't stop! Don't stop!</i>

662
00:37:51,082 --> 00:37:52,606
<i>Go, go, go, go!</i>

663
00:37:52,684 --> 00:37:53,912
<i>Go, go, go, go!</i>

664
00:37:53,985 --> 00:37:56,010
<i>Our Fords
are bright tonight</i>

665
00:37:56,087 --> 00:37:57,850
<i>Go, go, go, go!</i>

666
00:37:57,922 --> 00:37:59,651
<i>They're outta sight tonight</i>

667
00:37:59,724 --> 00:38:01,453
<i>Go, go, go, go!</i>

668
00:38:01,526 --> 00:38:05,587
<i>They're really right tonight
Don't stop! Don't stop!</i>

669
00:38:05,663 --> 00:38:07,290
<i>Go, go, go, go, go!</i>

670
00:38:07,365 --> 00:38:10,027
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
members of the Ford family.</i>

671
00:38:10,101 --> 00:38:12,968
<i>Introducing the new, the
redesigned, the finest</i>

672
00:38:13,037 --> 00:38:16,234
<i>Ford Mustang in the history
of the Ford Motor Company.</i>

673
00:38:16,307 --> 00:38:18,741
<i>With more options
than ever before.</i>

674
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:21,210
<i>Stereo, rear window defroster</i>

675
00:38:21,279 --> 00:38:25,773
<i>and the brand-new electronic Intermittent
Windshield Wiper. Let's give it a hand!</i>

676
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:35,985
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, have you seen
anything that's sexier than that?</i>

677
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:39,427
<i>And I'm talking about the car
now, not the Mustang girls,</i>

678
00:38:39,497 --> 00:38:42,864
<i>who, by the way, know these
automobiles inside out.</i>

679
00:38:42,934 --> 00:38:46,461
<i>Don't hesitate to ask them any
questions you have, and remember,</i>

680
00:38:46,537 --> 00:38:50,769
<i>in the main auditorium we have
all of next year's exciting buys!</i>

681
00:39:02,153 --> 00:39:04,678
Excuse me, sir. Could
I see your invitation?

682
00:39:04,756 --> 00:39:07,486
<i>Uh, I'm with,
uh, Mr. Tyler.</i>

683
00:39:07,558 --> 00:39:09,253
<i>Why don't we talk
about it outside?</i>

684
00:39:09,327 --> 00:39:10,419
<i>No, I'm with Mr...</i>

685
00:39:10,495 --> 00:39:11,484
Mr. Tyler!

686
00:39:11,562 --> 00:39:13,621
Sir, please.
Right this way.

687
00:39:14,832 --> 00:39:15,821
Mr. Tyler!

688
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,458
Right this way, sir.

689
00:39:18,569 --> 00:39:20,434
Sir, outside.
Thank you.

690
00:39:22,473 --> 00:39:23,804
Okay. Easy.

691
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:25,240
Step outside.
Easy!

692
00:39:26,277 --> 00:39:27,938
Their story is that they
went with another design,

693
00:39:28,012 --> 00:39:29,536
one they had in the
works before ours.

694
00:39:29,614 --> 00:39:30,706
Yeah, and that's...
Or yours.

695
00:39:30,782 --> 00:39:32,215
<i>...just what it is.
It's a story.</i>

696
00:39:32,283 --> 00:39:33,545
<i>It's a goddamn lie.</i>

697
00:39:33,618 --> 00:39:36,212
Come on. No, no, I took apart
one of their motors, Gil.

698
00:39:36,287 --> 00:39:39,984
You know what I found inside? Transistors,
capacitors, variable resistors.

699
00:39:40,058 --> 00:39:41,958
Now, that is my design!

700
00:39:44,028 --> 00:39:47,156
<i>What about the patents?
Aren't they worth anything?</i>

701
00:39:47,231 --> 00:39:49,290
<i>Legally, they're
Previck's patents.</i>

702
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:50,561
What is that
supposed to mean?

703
00:39:50,635 --> 00:39:53,001
<i>Nothing. It's
a technical term.</i>

704
00:39:53,705 --> 00:39:55,366
<i>Barney's putting together
another letter. It's tougher.</i>

705
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,771
<i>You can take a look at
it once it's drafted.</i>

706
00:39:56,841 --> 00:39:58,138
Another letter?

707
00:39:58,209 --> 00:40:00,302
A letter? Gil, they
stole this from us!

708
00:40:00,378 --> 00:40:03,313
<i>Whoa! Let's be careful
with our language.</i>

709
00:40:03,381 --> 00:40:04,814
<i>Let's not use words
like "steal. "</i>

710
00:40:04,882 --> 00:40:06,907
Who the hell is this guy? Huh?

711
00:40:06,984 --> 00:40:08,849
<i>Bob... Who the hell are
you? What's your angle?</i>

712
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:12,321
Bob! We gotta be really
strategic about this. Methodical.

713
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:15,120
And whatever you say
reflects on all of us.

714
00:40:15,193 --> 00:40:18,094
So we're gonna fight it, but
we're gonna do it the right way.

715
00:40:18,162 --> 00:40:19,959
How long is it gonna
take to get an answer?

716
00:40:20,031 --> 00:40:22,761
<i>First, this is Ford.
It won't be quick.</i>

717
00:40:23,801 --> 00:40:27,168
Second, patents. Christ,
they're a minefield.

718
00:40:27,238 --> 00:40:30,537
Not to mention, the patent
courts are totally jammed.

719
00:40:30,942 --> 00:40:32,500
<i>It's gonna take
some time.</i>

720
00:40:32,577 --> 00:40:36,809
Well, whatever it takes. The point
is, this is all gonna be okay.

721
00:40:39,016 --> 00:40:43,510
<i>Good. And in the meantime, let's
go a little softer on the language.</i>

722
00:40:47,425 --> 00:40:52,829
So, a lot of these formulas work
in opposition with one another.

723
00:40:52,897 --> 00:40:56,731
So that a capacitive
reactance,

724
00:40:58,035 --> 00:41:03,769
uh, varies inversely
with the product

725
00:41:05,176 --> 00:41:06,734
of both...

726
00:41:07,812 --> 00:41:09,245
Uh, frequency?

727
00:41:09,313 --> 00:41:11,213
Yeah. Did I
call on you?

728
00:41:12,049 --> 00:41:13,243
Sorry.

729
00:41:14,118 --> 00:41:17,986
Frequency, yes. And
capacitance. Make a note of it.

730
00:41:21,325 --> 00:41:23,225
<i>I'm gonna take
a quick break.</i>

731
00:41:25,096 --> 00:41:27,587
<i>Mr. Previck would appreciate
your patience in this matter.</i>

732
00:41:27,665 --> 00:41:31,999
<i>Yes, well, I'd appreciate it if Mr.
Previck could return my phone call.</i>

733
00:42:06,604 --> 00:42:09,232
<i>Who is it?
It's Mr. Kearns.</i>

734
00:42:09,874 --> 00:42:11,136
Come in, Mr. Kearns.

735
00:42:11,209 --> 00:42:13,268
Oh, hi, Wade.
Hi.

736
00:42:13,344 --> 00:42:14,834
Wade, did you
ask who it was?

737
00:42:14,912 --> 00:42:16,641
He did, Jean. Hi.

738
00:42:16,714 --> 00:42:18,944
<i>Hi. Bob!
What's going on?</i>

739
00:42:19,016 --> 00:42:21,007
Uh, is Gil here?

740
00:42:21,085 --> 00:42:24,054
<i>It's not really a great time
right now. You should have called.</i>

741
00:42:24,121 --> 00:42:27,022
Jean, hon, do you mind
getting me a refill?

742
00:42:27,091 --> 00:42:28,285
Sure, hon.

743
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,227
Thanks, hon.
I'll just be a second.

744
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,728
Okay.

745
00:42:34,565 --> 00:42:36,658
<i>I'm sorry. I...
Hang on a second.</i>

746
00:42:36,734 --> 00:42:39,066
I thought we were gonna stay
in communication here, so...

747
00:42:39,136 --> 00:42:41,366
<i>Don't you think it's a little outta
line, you coming over like this?</i>

748
00:42:41,439 --> 00:42:44,431
<i>Okay, well, you haven't
returned my calls in six days.</i>

749
00:42:44,508 --> 00:42:46,066
<i>I'm not sure
I like your tone.</i>

750
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:48,737
<i>I'm through waiting. I'm not
gonna sit around and do nothing.</i>

751
00:42:48,813 --> 00:42:50,303
You're not
doing nothing.

752
00:42:50,381 --> 00:42:53,043
You called the lawyer, you
pulled Taylor out of a mock trial.

753
00:42:53,117 --> 00:42:54,584
You're on everybody.

754
00:42:54,652 --> 00:42:57,052
<i>You even called my father,
for crying out loud. He's sick!</i>

755
00:42:57,121 --> 00:43:00,113
Tell me one thing. Are
you backing out of this?

756
00:43:01,025 --> 00:43:02,652
<i>What I'm doing is
looking at our options</i>

757
00:43:02,727 --> 00:43:05,161
like any sensible
person would.

758
00:43:05,229 --> 00:43:07,060
Of course they're stonewalling
us. What do you expect?

759
00:43:07,131 --> 00:43:09,156
So then we take
them to court!

760
00:43:09,233 --> 00:43:10,359
Is that right?

761
00:43:10,434 --> 00:43:14,700
This is Detroit, Bob. I did $17
million in business last year.

762
00:43:15,506 --> 00:43:16,734
<i>You want to guess what
I'm gonna do next year</i>

763
00:43:16,807 --> 00:43:18,240
if I start taking my
customers to court?

764
00:43:18,309 --> 00:43:21,403
This is not about money. This is
about right and wrong, and you know it.

765
00:43:21,479 --> 00:43:22,946
<i>For Christ's sake,
you're my friend!</i>

766
00:43:23,014 --> 00:43:25,209
<i>That's right. I am.</i>

767
00:43:25,716 --> 00:43:27,775
Did you ask to be involved in this deal?

768
00:43:27,852 --> 00:43:29,843
You need some
perspective.

769
00:43:30,288 --> 00:43:34,884
You need to take a hard look at reality
and realize what we're up against.

770
00:43:34,959 --> 00:43:36,392
<i>It's not your
only good idea.</i>

771
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:40,226
You've been coming up with stuff
like this since you were 14.

772
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:46,727
Now, I need to get back to my
dinner, so we'll continue this later.

773
00:43:48,072 --> 00:43:49,903
I'll go it alone.

774
00:43:49,974 --> 00:43:52,670
No. Leave it
alone. Bob?

775
00:43:54,478 --> 00:43:56,139
<i>It's not over yet.</i>

776
00:44:08,526 --> 00:44:10,517
<i>I'm not gonna
back off of this.</i>

777
00:44:11,028 --> 00:44:14,555
<i>We don't have the money to
bring in lawyers right now,</i>

778
00:44:14,632 --> 00:44:16,327
so we're gonna have to do the
legwork ourselves, and then...

779
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,833
Are you talking about
suing Gil Previck?

780
00:44:17,902 --> 00:44:19,802
No. No, we're gonna go
after the Ford Motor Company.

781
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:21,132
They're the ones that screwed us. What?

782
00:44:21,205 --> 00:44:22,604
Gil just let me down.

783
00:44:22,673 --> 00:44:23,765
Robert, slow down.
We're...

784
00:44:23,841 --> 00:44:25,570
No, no, we're gonna have
to dig up everything

785
00:44:25,643 --> 00:44:27,838
<i>that's ever been written about me. Okay?</i>

786
00:44:27,912 --> 00:44:30,039
Character stuff,
everything.

787
00:44:30,114 --> 00:44:34,175
<i>This is my number one priority,
Phyllis. Whatever it's gonna take.</i>

788
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:37,587
<i>Josh, I'm gonna need at
least 10 new wiper motors.</i>

789
00:44:37,655 --> 00:44:39,316
And some of the earlier versions, too.

790
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:40,789
Sure, Professor.
Not a problem.

791
00:44:40,858 --> 00:44:42,416
Good. And
circuit boards.

792
00:44:42,493 --> 00:44:44,484
Yeah, they just trash
the test models anyway.

793
00:44:44,562 --> 00:44:46,860
All right, um, where
are we gonna do this?

794
00:44:46,931 --> 00:44:50,128
I'll meet you at the first
lab on the second floor.

795
00:44:50,201 --> 00:44:51,361
Okay.

796
00:44:53,137 --> 00:44:54,729
<i>Where's the
itemization file?</i>

797
00:44:54,805 --> 00:44:57,273
All the files
are in here, hon.

798
00:44:57,341 --> 00:44:58,603
You should see a doctor.

799
00:44:58,676 --> 00:45:00,974
<i>Oh, I'm fine.
Let's keep going.</i>

800
00:45:01,045 --> 00:45:03,741
Previck Automotive
Legal Affairs.

801
00:45:03,814 --> 00:45:07,580
Something to bring their attention
that various automotive manufacturers

802
00:45:07,651 --> 00:45:11,052
are considering using
electronic intermittent wiper...

803
00:45:11,122 --> 00:45:12,146
<i>I don't have it yet.</i>

804
00:45:12,223 --> 00:45:15,056
Considering using electronic
intermittent wiper control...

805
00:45:15,126 --> 00:45:16,491
Do you want to list who?
Yes.

806
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,223
And that these are in direct
violation of patents jointly held

807
00:45:20,297 --> 00:45:23,266
by both Previck and
Kearns Corporation.

808
00:45:23,334 --> 00:45:26,326
As the inventor of the
Intermittent Wiper, I ask, no...

809
00:45:26,404 --> 00:45:28,804
I demand that they take
immediate legal action.

810
00:45:28,873 --> 00:45:31,740
<i>"Demand" is too strong.
They're our friends.</i>

811
00:45:31,809 --> 00:45:33,071
What difference
does it make?

812
00:45:33,144 --> 00:45:35,112
They're not gonna
read it anyway.

813
00:45:35,179 --> 00:45:36,168
Then why are
we doing this?

814
00:45:36,247 --> 00:45:37,714
Because it makes
me feel better.

815
00:45:37,782 --> 00:45:38,840
Does it?

816
00:45:39,417 --> 00:45:43,410
What is this file?
What is this?

817
00:45:45,956 --> 00:45:49,551
Kathy won it in the swim
meet. She wanted you to see it.

818
00:45:55,566 --> 00:45:58,433
This is a bad
case of psoriasis.

819
00:45:58,502 --> 00:46:01,437
Now, Phyllis, I want you to take
care of yourself. Use the medication.

820
00:46:01,505 --> 00:46:03,336
<i>Here's the sample.
Thanks.</i>

821
00:46:03,407 --> 00:46:05,534
<i>And I'm going to write
you a prescription.</i>

822
00:46:05,609 --> 00:46:07,099
How long do I
take that for?

823
00:46:07,178 --> 00:46:09,009
Well, just a month.

824
00:46:10,147 --> 00:46:14,277
<i>I don't know what's going on with you,
Phyllis, but this is all stress-related.</i>

825
00:46:14,351 --> 00:46:17,184
You understand me? You have to
take the stress level way down.

826
00:46:17,254 --> 00:46:18,346
I'll be fine.

827
00:46:31,669 --> 00:46:33,227
Hello, Jean.
Phyllis.

828
00:46:33,304 --> 00:46:35,135
How are the kids?
Good.

829
00:46:37,341 --> 00:46:38,672
Phyllis.

830
00:46:40,678 --> 00:46:42,475
Why is Bob
doing this?

831
00:46:43,747 --> 00:46:45,578
<i>He can't stand
being called a liar.</i>

832
00:46:45,649 --> 00:46:48,049
<i>Well, nobody's
saying that he is.</i>

833
00:46:48,552 --> 00:46:49,883
They might as well be.

834
00:46:49,954 --> 00:46:53,754
<i>Oh, for God's sake, Phyllis,
it's Ford. He can't win.</i>

835
00:46:54,859 --> 00:46:56,486
Take care, Jean.

836
00:47:11,008 --> 00:47:12,839
Oh! God!

837
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:15,811
Yeah. Med school gives them to us.

838
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:17,780
We use them
for crash tests.

839
00:47:17,848 --> 00:47:19,816
You should see it when we
drop them down elevator shafts.

840
00:47:19,884 --> 00:47:21,784
<i>It's very instructive.</i>

841
00:47:21,852 --> 00:47:24,912
I'll try that sometime.
Did you get the boards?

842
00:47:26,157 --> 00:47:27,385
What the hell is this?

843
00:47:27,458 --> 00:47:30,791
<i>I know, it's just motors. I
couldn't get any circuit boards.</i>

844
00:47:30,861 --> 00:47:31,919
Why not?

845
00:47:31,996 --> 00:47:35,591
<i>They didn't have any extras. Didn't
have any complete units. I don't know.</i>

846
00:47:35,666 --> 00:47:37,190
These are nothing.

847
00:47:37,268 --> 00:47:38,758
Hey, man, this is
the best I could do.

848
00:47:38,836 --> 00:47:40,497
<i>This doesn't
help me, Josh!</i>

849
00:47:40,571 --> 00:47:41,663
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

850
00:47:41,739 --> 00:47:43,969
What does that mean?

851
00:47:46,744 --> 00:47:48,268
Wait a minute.

852
00:47:49,647 --> 00:47:51,547
Did somebody
talk to you?

853
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:56,012
Did you have a conversation about me?

854
00:47:56,487 --> 00:47:57,579
What?

855
00:47:59,023 --> 00:48:00,991
Are you working
with them?

856
00:48:02,193 --> 00:48:03,626
Huh? You even know
who they are?

857
00:48:03,694 --> 00:48:05,218
Man, I gotta go.

858
00:48:05,296 --> 00:48:06,354
They're the...

859
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:08,990
<i>They're the ones who don't
give a shit about you!</i>

860
00:49:58,142 --> 00:50:00,110
Hey! Hey!

861
00:50:01,779 --> 00:50:03,041
Come on!

862
00:50:04,081 --> 00:50:07,141
What the hell are you doing? Hey! Hey!

863
00:52:04,401 --> 00:52:07,700
Look at this lady. She had
five babies at the same time.

864
00:52:09,306 --> 00:52:12,173
<i>That's quintuplets,
that's what they're called.</i>

865
00:52:18,582 --> 00:52:19,606
Hello.

866
00:52:19,683 --> 00:52:20,877
<i>Is this
Mrs. Robert Kearns?</i>

867
00:52:20,951 --> 00:52:21,975
Yes.

868
00:52:22,052 --> 00:52:24,612
<i>Mrs. Kearns, this is Trooper Dale with
the Maryland State Police Department.</i>

869
00:52:24,688 --> 00:52:27,316
<i>Yes. We've located your husband, ma'am.</i>

870
00:52:27,391 --> 00:52:28,483
Is he okay?

871
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:30,151
<i>Well, he was found on a bus
outside of Brunswick.</i>

872
00:52:30,227 --> 00:52:33,685
A bus? Where is he? May
I speak to him, please?

873
00:52:33,764 --> 00:52:35,561
<i>Uh, no, ma'am,
he's not here.</i>

874
00:52:35,632 --> 00:52:38,032
<i>He's being transported to a
hospital facility in Rockville.</i>

875
00:52:38,101 --> 00:52:39,534
What happened?

876
00:52:39,603 --> 00:52:43,198
<i>Sorry, I don't know exactly, but you'll
hear from the hospital when he arrives.</i>

877
00:52:43,273 --> 00:52:44,262
<i>Will you be at
this number?</i>

878
00:52:44,341 --> 00:52:46,104
Yes, we'll be here.
Thank you so much.

879
00:52:46,176 --> 00:52:47,370
<i>Thank you, Mrs. Kearns.</i>

880
00:52:47,444 --> 00:52:48,934
<i>Thank you.
Bye.</i>

881
00:53:08,131 --> 00:53:09,792
Hey, Bob.

882
00:53:14,238 --> 00:53:16,069
Chair or couch today?

883
00:53:16,139 --> 00:53:17,538
Your choice.

884
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:21,506
<i>How's it going?
Okay,</i>

885
00:53:22,112 --> 00:53:23,511
I guess.
Good.

886
00:53:25,182 --> 00:53:28,208
<i>I don't feel like I need
to talk about it today.</i>

887
00:53:29,086 --> 00:53:30,178
Okay.

888
00:53:36,593 --> 00:53:38,686
It is hard getting past it.

889
00:53:38,996 --> 00:53:40,554
<i>I'm sure it is.</i>

890
00:53:45,536 --> 00:53:47,868
Did you write any
of these books?

891
00:53:48,405 --> 00:53:52,432
<i>I did. There's a thesis and several
binders full of journal articles.</i>

892
00:53:52,509 --> 00:53:57,708
How would you feel if another
doctor took credit for those?

893
00:53:58,448 --> 00:54:02,782
Just came along and
put his name on there.

894
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:04,881
I take your point.

895
00:54:04,955 --> 00:54:08,550
But at the same time, if getting
my name back on those articles

896
00:54:08,625 --> 00:54:10,957
overwhelmed my responsibilities
here at the hospital,

897
00:54:11,028 --> 00:54:13,360
or kept me from
creating new work,

898
00:54:13,864 --> 00:54:17,231
<i>would that be worth it? Would
it be healthy? I don't know.</i>

899
00:54:17,301 --> 00:54:19,292
<i>I can't answer that.</i>

900
00:54:19,369 --> 00:54:21,860
Do you want to
continue fighting this?

901
00:54:21,939 --> 00:54:22,963
No.

902
00:54:25,676 --> 00:54:27,234
No. No, I don't.

903
00:54:48,532 --> 00:54:50,090
Thank you.
Mmm-hmm.

904
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:01,372
Who is that?

905
00:55:04,615 --> 00:55:06,412
Come on, you
guys. Tim?

906
00:55:19,863 --> 00:55:21,797
Come here, you. How
you doing? Hi, Daddy.

907
00:55:21,865 --> 00:55:23,355
Hi, how are you guys?
Daddy, I made you a picture

908
00:55:23,433 --> 00:55:24,661
Daddy!
I'll get the bag.

909
00:55:24,735 --> 00:55:26,464
No, I got
the bag. Tim, let go!

910
00:55:26,536 --> 00:55:28,731
<i>You look good.
Where's Dennis?</i>

911
00:55:28,839 --> 00:55:31,273
<i>You okay? He's coming
later. He's just late.</i>

912
00:55:31,341 --> 00:55:32,467
How are you, buddy?
You okay?

913
00:56:06,309 --> 00:56:07,298
Hey.

914
00:56:12,215 --> 00:56:16,379
What do you say we round up the
board of directors and go for a ride?

915
00:56:19,723 --> 00:56:21,623
Kearns Corporation.
Mmm.

916
00:56:23,927 --> 00:56:25,394
<i>No, I'm fine.</i>

917
00:56:48,285 --> 00:56:49,946
<i>Let's see here.</i>

918
00:56:51,822 --> 00:56:54,256
Mmm-hmm.
Mmm-hmm.

919
00:56:54,825 --> 00:56:57,885
How do you pronounce
your name? Kee-urns?

920
00:56:57,961 --> 00:56:58,950
Kearns.

921
00:56:59,029 --> 00:57:00,587
Mr. Kearns.

922
00:57:01,031 --> 00:57:03,659
An inventor.
Mmm-hmm.

923
00:57:03,967 --> 00:57:06,094
What have you invented?

924
00:57:06,236 --> 00:57:07,635
A lot of things.

925
00:57:07,704 --> 00:57:10,229
Yeah, my brother-in-law
does a lot of that.

926
00:57:10,307 --> 00:57:14,539
<i>Never sold anything, though.
He's actually in pest control.</i>

927
00:57:14,945 --> 00:57:17,140
You really a doctor?

928
00:57:17,214 --> 00:57:18,238
Ph. D.

929
00:57:18,315 --> 00:57:19,475
Uh-huh.

930
00:57:20,951 --> 00:57:24,352
Well, Doctor, take a look
at your information.

931
00:57:24,421 --> 00:57:27,219
<i>Make sure it's correct.
Sign at the bottom.</i>

932
00:57:29,192 --> 00:57:31,786
You'll probably get your
first check in about six weeks.

933
00:57:31,862 --> 00:57:34,160
Proceed to the third
window on your left.

934
00:57:34,231 --> 00:57:35,493
Thank you.

935
00:57:35,966 --> 00:57:37,263
Move forward.

936
00:57:52,015 --> 00:57:53,073
Hi.

937
00:57:56,219 --> 00:57:57,846
Can I talk to you
for a second?

938
00:57:57,921 --> 00:57:59,411
Am I in trouble?

939
00:57:59,723 --> 00:58:00,781
No.

940
00:58:12,502 --> 00:58:17,064
I know you're mad at me. Is
it because I embarrassed you?

941
00:58:19,176 --> 00:58:20,666
Because I got sick?

942
00:58:20,744 --> 00:58:22,177
<i>I don't like
you like this.</i>

943
00:58:22,245 --> 00:58:24,805
<i>Okay. Well, that's why
I want to talk to you.</i>

944
00:58:24,881 --> 00:58:27,782
<i>I didn't like it like
it was before, either.</i>

945
00:58:28,885 --> 00:58:30,978
<i>I didn't do
anything wrong.</i>

946
00:58:31,488 --> 00:58:35,356
<i>Look, Dennis, if I don't fight
back, if I don't do something,</i>

947
00:58:35,425 --> 00:58:37,825
<i>I'm afraid I'm gonna start
feeling like I did before.</i>

948
00:58:37,894 --> 00:58:39,794
<i>And I can't
handle that.</i>

949
00:58:42,165 --> 00:58:44,895
<i>I got a lawyer. And
it's gonna be difficult.</i>

950
00:58:44,968 --> 00:58:46,333
<i>And it's gonna be
tough on your mom.</i>

951
00:58:46,403 --> 00:58:49,702
And I may not be around as
much. And I need your help.

952
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:53,899
You're just starting this all
over again. No, this is different.

953
00:58:58,415 --> 00:59:00,542
Is that all you
have to say?

954
00:59:00,917 --> 00:59:01,975
Yeah.

955
00:59:10,727 --> 00:59:13,662
<i>And I'll tell you something.
Now, I'm old-fashioned.</i>

956
00:59:13,730 --> 00:59:18,064
<i>I'm not out for the quick score. This
firm is in this for the long haul.</i>

957
00:59:18,268 --> 00:59:21,499
<i>That's why I'm very glad that
you're here today, Mrs. Kearns.</i>

958
00:59:21,571 --> 00:59:24,438
From several phone calls with
Bob, I think I understand now

959
00:59:24,507 --> 00:59:25,769
what his level
of commitment is.

960
00:59:25,842 --> 00:59:28,242
But this is part
of your life, too.

961
00:59:28,845 --> 00:59:30,904
<i>I'd like to know where
you stand on this.</i>

962
00:59:30,981 --> 00:59:34,109
I want to understand
exactly what this would be.

963
00:59:34,217 --> 00:59:35,275
What it would
mean for us.

964
00:59:35,352 --> 00:59:36,410
Well, as long as
you know that

965
00:59:36,486 --> 00:59:40,183
suing one of the most powerful
corporations in the world is...

966
00:59:40,423 --> 00:59:43,984
<i>It's not something you take on lightly.
I mean, let's be clear about this.</i>

967
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:45,584
Ford is just the first.

968
00:59:45,662 --> 00:59:48,460
We're gonna be bringing suits
against every automobile company

969
00:59:48,531 --> 00:59:50,658
<i>that's infringed on your
husband's patents.</i>

970
00:59:50,734 --> 00:59:52,429
<i>But Ford's number one.</i>

971
00:59:52,502 --> 00:59:56,165
<i>Once they decided to put your
husband's invention on their car,</i>

972
00:59:56,239 --> 00:59:59,731
they gave a green light to
every auto company in the world.

973
00:59:59,809 --> 01:00:02,004
<i>"To hell with your
husband," is what they said.</i>

974
01:00:02,078 --> 01:00:05,912
Let me tell you something, Mrs.
Kearns. I believe in what I do.

975
01:00:06,483 --> 01:00:08,781
I believe in a little
thing called justice.

976
01:00:08,852 --> 01:00:11,719
These bastards think they can
walk all over anybody they want.

977
01:00:11,788 --> 01:00:15,656
But we're here to tell them that
they can't, that it stops right here.

978
01:00:15,725 --> 01:00:17,192
<i>And I don't want you
to worry that this</i>

979
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:20,593
<i>is gonna take over your time or
your life, because that's my job.</i>

980
01:00:20,664 --> 01:00:23,292
<i>All right? That's why
I went to law school.</i>

981
01:00:23,366 --> 01:00:26,199
Lan, this is Dr. Bob Kearns
and his wife, Phyllis.

982
01:00:26,269 --> 01:00:27,634
This is Ian Meillor.
How do you do?

983
01:00:27,704 --> 01:00:29,262
<i>He's gonna be working
on this with me.</i>

984
01:00:29,339 --> 01:00:31,364
I just want to
thank both of you

985
01:00:31,441 --> 01:00:33,375
for giving us the opportunity
to really make a difference here.

986
01:00:33,443 --> 01:00:36,003
<i>One of the first items on our
agenda's gonna be discovery.</i>

987
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:38,411
Yeah, I cannot wait to see
what they've got in those files.

988
01:00:38,481 --> 01:00:41,814
We're gonna jump right into
it starting this afternoon.

989
01:00:42,585 --> 01:00:44,450
Thank you very much.

990
01:00:45,255 --> 01:00:47,985
<i>And one other thing, I'd like to
stay as involved in this as possible.</i>

991
01:00:48,058 --> 01:00:51,186
Of course. Of course, Dr. Kearns,
your help will be invaluable.

992
01:00:51,261 --> 01:00:52,990
In fact, we have to
get... What is it?

993
01:00:53,063 --> 01:00:55,623
Previck Auto. Yeah. We have
to get them on board ASAP.

994
01:00:55,699 --> 01:00:57,257
Think you can do
any good there?

995
01:00:57,334 --> 01:00:58,426
I'll see.

996
01:00:58,501 --> 01:00:59,525
Very good to meet you.
Thanks for coming in.

997
01:00:59,602 --> 01:01:01,194
Thank you so much. We're
relieved. Thank you.

998
01:01:01,271 --> 01:01:05,435
<i>I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob,
it's just a windshield wiper.</i>

999
01:01:05,508 --> 01:01:11,344
<i>To you, maybe. To that bartender up
there. But to me it's the Mona Lisa.</i>

1000
01:01:11,414 --> 01:01:16,215
Well, you know what I mean. But I
just thought that when you got back,

1001
01:01:16,286 --> 01:01:18,379
<i>you'd have a different perspective.</i>

1002
01:01:18,455 --> 01:01:20,753
<i>I do. I'm handling
it differently.</i>

1003
01:01:21,358 --> 01:01:23,451
<i>Maybe you are.
I don't know.</i>

1004
01:01:26,129 --> 01:01:27,187
So what are
you gonna do?

1005
01:01:27,263 --> 01:01:31,700
<i>I don't know. Maybe
I'm out of options.</i>

1006
01:01:36,006 --> 01:01:37,803
<i>Why don't you sue me?</i>

1007
01:01:37,874 --> 01:01:41,810
<i>Kearns versus Previck.
Got a nice sound to it.</i>

1008
01:01:41,878 --> 01:01:43,846
<i>Well, then
why wouldn't you?</i>

1009
01:01:43,913 --> 01:01:46,643
<i>You've sued everybody else.
What's wrong with me?</i>

1010
01:01:46,716 --> 01:01:49,981
Nothing. Other than that
I've known you for 25 years.

1011
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:52,720
Maybe you ought
to think about it.

1012
01:01:53,390 --> 01:01:56,382
Get your lawyer to draft a
letter threatening to sue us.

1013
01:01:56,459 --> 01:02:00,054
If we're lucky, we'll get a
quick settlement. You understand?

1014
01:02:03,233 --> 01:02:05,497
Then you can have
your damn patents.

1015
01:02:08,038 --> 01:02:09,164
Okay.

1016
01:02:09,239 --> 01:02:12,538
Okay, but, Bob, you gotta forget
my name when it comes to Ford.

1017
01:02:12,609 --> 01:02:15,806
We're not gonna testify against
them. We're not gonna appear.

1018
01:02:15,879 --> 01:02:18,040
I mean it.
Well, say it.

1019
01:02:18,748 --> 01:02:21,911
<i>You won't testify. Previck
won't be involved in any way.</i>

1020
01:02:24,888 --> 01:02:27,619
All right.

1021
01:02:29,826 --> 01:02:31,657
<i>Dear Dr. Kearns,</i>

1022
01:02:31,728 --> 01:02:33,889
<i>Previck Automotive has
received your demand letter</i>

1023
01:02:33,963 --> 01:02:36,796
<i>concerning the Kearns
Blinking Eye Wiper.</i>

1024
01:02:36,866 --> 01:02:40,233
<i>While Previck has acted in accordance
with the terms of our agreement,</i>

1025
01:02:40,303 --> 01:02:42,066
<i>in order to avoid litigation,</i>

1026
01:02:42,138 --> 01:02:46,768
<i>we have decided to assign to you
our rights to the registered patents.</i>

1027
01:02:46,843 --> 01:02:49,277
<i>You will now be the sole
owner of the patents.</i>

1028
01:02:49,345 --> 01:02:51,575
<i>Best regards, Gil Previck.</i>

1029
01:02:54,284 --> 01:02:56,411
No, you had back
there a nice bread

1030
01:02:56,486 --> 01:02:58,044
<i>that's all twisted up with
salt on it. I don't know.</i>

1031
01:02:58,121 --> 01:02:59,383
Yeah, we could
do that.

1032
01:02:59,456 --> 01:03:01,822
No, wait, there they are!
There they are. Phyllis, hi.

1033
01:03:01,891 --> 01:03:03,222
Hi. So good to see you.
Hello, Bob.

1034
01:03:03,293 --> 01:03:06,262
Thank you, Jimmy. And would
you bring us a bottle of Mot?

1035
01:03:06,329 --> 01:03:07,353
Sure.

1036
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:10,126
Sit down, sit down.
Sounds like good news.

1037
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:13,761
<i>I'd say it is. In fact, you could
call this a celebration dinner.</i>

1038
01:03:13,837 --> 01:03:15,532
This is exciting.

1039
01:03:16,339 --> 01:03:19,797
Would you like to know who
called me on the phone today?

1040
01:03:20,076 --> 01:03:21,543
Charlie Defao.

1041
01:03:22,212 --> 01:03:23,975
Well, you may not
know that name,

1042
01:03:24,047 --> 01:03:27,574
<i>but he's the man Macklin Tyler
calls when it's closing time.</i>

1043
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:31,776
<i>And he's not a man to waste
his time on trivial matters.</i>

1044
01:03:32,489 --> 01:03:37,188
<i>Bob, Phyllis, I'm very
pleased to report to you</i>

1045
01:03:38,061 --> 01:03:41,553
that Ford has offered
to settle for $250,000.

1046
01:03:43,366 --> 01:03:46,529
Two hundred and fifty
thousand dollars. Oh, my gosh.

1047
01:03:46,603 --> 01:03:49,299
Settle? Now, what does that
mean in practical terms?

1048
01:03:49,372 --> 01:03:50,896
<i>'Cause I thought we
weren't gonna pursue that.</i>

1049
01:03:50,974 --> 01:03:52,703
No, that was
our agreement.

1050
01:03:52,775 --> 01:03:55,972
<i>And we didn't do anything
to seek this settlement.</i>

1051
01:03:56,446 --> 01:03:57,913
<i>This is Ford's offer.</i>

1052
01:03:59,149 --> 01:04:00,639
And, frankly, we're
a little surprised.

1053
01:04:00,717 --> 01:04:03,584
We're goddamned shocked,
excuse the language.

1054
01:04:03,653 --> 01:04:04,847
Happily shocked,
though.

1055
01:04:04,921 --> 01:04:09,483
Okay, but in this offer, do
they admit it was my invention?

1056
01:04:09,559 --> 01:04:11,151
That they lied about it.

1057
01:04:11,227 --> 01:04:12,785
In a settlement
like this,

1058
01:04:12,862 --> 01:04:15,831
<i>it's customary that both sides
are enjoined from commenting.</i>

1059
01:04:15,899 --> 01:04:18,424
<i>What that means is, they don't
say it wasn't your invention.</i>

1060
01:04:18,501 --> 01:04:21,595
<i>No, absolutely not. No. No, no,
no, no. We wouldn't allow that.</i>

1061
01:04:21,671 --> 01:04:23,298
<i>But they won't say
they stole it.</i>

1062
01:04:23,373 --> 01:04:26,240
No, but if they're
offering $250,000,

1063
01:04:26,309 --> 01:04:28,834
I think we can see
$350,000. Maybe four.

1064
01:04:28,912 --> 01:04:31,938
<i>That's wonderful, I think
we'd like to think about it.</i>

1065
01:04:32,015 --> 01:04:33,539
Sure, of course.

1066
01:04:33,616 --> 01:04:37,609
<i>Phyllis is right. You should think
it over. It's been a rough 15 rounds.</i>

1067
01:04:37,687 --> 01:04:40,485
<i>No, there's nothing to
think about. Tell them no.</i>

1068
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:47,891
<i>Bob, let's take a bird's
eye view for a moment, okay?</i>

1069
01:04:48,398 --> 01:04:53,097
First off, if you're really thinking
of turning this down and going to court,

1070
01:04:53,169 --> 01:04:55,637
<i>that's a very
expensive proposition.</i>

1071
01:04:55,705 --> 01:04:58,196
<i>It's not a good...
It's not a good play.</i>

1072
01:04:58,274 --> 01:05:00,708
<i>I'm not talking about
play, Mr. Lawson.</i>

1073
01:05:01,377 --> 01:05:03,777
Let me just tell you something
for future reference, Bob.

1074
01:05:03,846 --> 01:05:06,906
<i>I don't appreciate the
way you're talking to me.</i>

1075
01:05:07,984 --> 01:05:10,475
<i>You don't have the most
charming personality.</i>

1076
01:05:10,553 --> 01:05:13,784
And at least four times a
week, I get a call from you

1077
01:05:13,856 --> 01:05:15,187
telling me what
the law is.

1078
01:05:15,258 --> 01:05:18,091
You're not a lawyer,
Dr. Kearns.

1079
01:05:18,161 --> 01:05:24,566
Now, from a real lawyer, from a 45-year
member of the bar, I can tell you,

1080
01:05:25,201 --> 01:05:28,762
this firm has spent more time on
your case than you can comprehend.

1081
01:05:28,838 --> 01:05:31,534
Maybe. But you're getting
money for this case.

1082
01:05:31,608 --> 01:05:32,836
Only if we settle.

1083
01:05:32,909 --> 01:05:35,434
<i>Bob, think it over.
It's essential.</i>

1084
01:05:35,511 --> 01:05:39,880
<i>Three, maybe $400,000, it's
enough to change your whole life.</i>

1085
01:05:39,949 --> 01:05:41,007
<i>I'm sure it would.</i>

1086
01:05:41,084 --> 01:05:42,381
It certainly seems
like a lot.

1087
01:05:42,452 --> 01:05:43,441
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

1088
01:05:43,519 --> 01:05:46,386
<i>Look, I'm sure you men think
this is a bunch of hogwash,</i>

1089
01:05:46,456 --> 01:05:48,856
but this is about
more than money.

1090
01:05:49,425 --> 01:05:51,552
I always thought I was put here
on this earth for a purpose.

1091
01:05:51,628 --> 01:05:55,394
I thought it was to be an
engineer. Or maybe an inventor.

1092
01:05:55,465 --> 01:05:57,956
<i>But that's not it. And
now I know what it is.</i>

1093
01:05:58,034 --> 01:06:00,468
God put you here to sue
the Ford Motor Company?

1094
01:06:00,536 --> 01:06:04,097
Look, I brought these here, thinking
that you had different ideas.

1095
01:06:04,173 --> 01:06:07,142
Edwin Armstrong
invented the FM radio.

1096
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:08,837
Somehow R.C.A. Ended
up with the patent.

1097
01:06:08,911 --> 01:06:12,608
He jumped out a 13-story
window. This was a good man!

1098
01:06:12,682 --> 01:06:16,448
He was an inventor. And, look,
I have letters from people.

1099
01:06:16,519 --> 01:06:18,919
People who've had their
ideas taken from them.

1100
01:06:18,988 --> 01:06:22,048
They've heard about us. They're in
their backyards and their garages,

1101
01:06:22,125 --> 01:06:24,525
and they're counting on me.
Please, just look at this.

1102
01:06:24,594 --> 01:06:26,858
<i>Thank you very much. I really don't
need to look at these right now.</i>

1103
01:06:26,929 --> 01:06:29,295
<i>Let's just get to
the point. Okay?</i>

1104
01:06:29,365 --> 01:06:32,459
This settlement offer
is very, very generous.

1105
01:06:32,535 --> 01:06:34,662
And if we did get
this before a jury,

1106
01:06:34,737 --> 01:06:36,364
if we prevailed,

1107
01:06:36,439 --> 01:06:40,205
if the jury gave you the
recognition you so obviously crave...

1108
01:06:40,276 --> 01:06:41,334
<i>That's insulting.</i>

1109
01:06:41,411 --> 01:06:43,879
...it is doubtful that
you would do any better

1110
01:06:43,946 --> 01:06:45,880
than you would right now
with this settlement.

1111
01:06:45,948 --> 01:06:49,281
And whatever happened to this little
thing called justice you talked about?

1112
01:06:49,352 --> 01:06:52,947
This is justice, Bob. This is how
justice is dispensed in this country.

1113
01:06:53,022 --> 01:06:54,182
With checkbooks.

1114
01:06:54,257 --> 01:06:57,488
There are no brass bands, you know.
There are no ticker tape parades.

1115
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:59,653
<i>The mayor doesn't give
you the key to the city</i>

1116
01:06:59,729 --> 01:07:01,629
and call you a hero.
You get a check.

1117
01:07:01,698 --> 01:07:05,634
And that check makes the lives of
you and your family a little easier.

1118
01:07:05,702 --> 01:07:08,398
<i>A little more pleasant.
It's that simple.</i>

1119
01:07:08,471 --> 01:07:11,804
Well, I'll make it simple,
too. Forget the check.

1120
01:07:12,442 --> 01:07:15,809
Get an admission that they stole it
and give me the right to manufacture

1121
01:07:15,878 --> 01:07:19,041
my wipers and
this'll all be over.

1122
01:07:19,382 --> 01:07:24,445
Bob, since I bought this wasted champagne,
just indulge me for a moment, okay?

1123
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:28,217
Just think about
this scenario.

1124
01:07:28,291 --> 01:07:31,556
Your lawsuit is over.
But you know what?

1125
01:07:31,627 --> 01:07:34,027
You're no longer
a young man. Why?

1126
01:07:34,097 --> 01:07:36,998
Because you're fighting a
corporation that, that does not

1127
01:07:37,066 --> 01:07:40,058
know the meaning
of years. Or money.

1128
01:07:41,104 --> 01:07:45,268
They'll bury you with motions,
injunctions, countersuits.

1129
01:07:45,341 --> 01:07:49,573
They'll drown you in so many irrelevant
documents that you'll wake up,

1130
01:07:49,645 --> 01:07:52,239
with cold sweats.

1131
01:07:52,315 --> 01:07:54,909
<i>And five years from now,
you won't be any closer</i>

1132
01:07:54,984 --> 01:07:57,817
to seeing the inside of a
courtroom than you are right now.

1133
01:07:57,887 --> 01:08:00,014
Your hair will turn gray.

1134
01:08:00,089 --> 01:08:02,649
Life will pass you by.
And for what?

1135
01:08:03,659 --> 01:08:07,060
Go home and talk about this with
your lovely wife. Sleep on it.

1136
01:08:08,231 --> 01:08:12,463
And then make your decision. And if you
make the decision that I hope you will,

1137
01:08:12,869 --> 01:08:14,962
this'll all be over
in a few days.

1138
01:08:18,741 --> 01:08:20,675
I'll show you what we got here
in the stacks on patent law,

1139
01:08:20,743 --> 01:08:23,769
<i>but there's a load more over
at the university library.</i>

1140
01:08:24,213 --> 01:08:25,976
And here you go.

1141
01:08:26,883 --> 01:08:29,943
<i>Oh, so it's all this?</i>

1142
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:32,283
Nope, and those shelves, too.

1143
01:08:32,355 --> 01:08:37,190
And that one there. And
half of that one, I think.

1144
01:08:38,961 --> 01:08:40,223
Thanks, Louis.

1145
01:08:40,696 --> 01:08:41,993
You're welcome.

1146
01:08:50,706 --> 01:08:52,503
<i>I'm sorry it's so late.</i>

1147
01:08:52,575 --> 01:08:55,066
<i>Uh-huh. I couldn't sleep.</i>

1148
01:08:56,446 --> 01:08:59,415
Well, no turning into me.

1149
01:09:03,619 --> 01:09:05,086
No turning into me.

1150
01:09:06,022 --> 01:09:08,013
Honey, I think we
should take the deal.

1151
01:09:10,493 --> 01:09:13,394
Well, I know you do.
But I don't.

1152
01:09:14,730 --> 01:09:16,698
<i>Robert, it's gone on
long enough now.</i>

1153
01:09:16,766 --> 01:09:18,131
We could really use the money.

1154
01:09:18,201 --> 01:09:19,691
Since when has this
been about money?

1155
01:09:19,769 --> 01:09:22,203
<i>It's not just about the money.
It's about our family.</i>

1156
01:09:22,271 --> 01:09:24,466
<i>Well, why do you
think I'm doing this?</i>

1157
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:27,100
How am I supposed to teach my
kids about doing the right thing

1158
01:09:27,176 --> 01:09:28,700
if I let these guys
get away with this?

1159
01:09:28,778 --> 01:09:30,746
<i>I'm not sure that's exactly
what we're teaching them.</i>

1160
01:09:30,813 --> 01:09:32,781
They like this. The kids
like being involved in it.

1161
01:09:32,849 --> 01:09:36,649
<i>No, they just don't want to let you
down. I don't want to let you down.</i>

1162
01:09:41,724 --> 01:09:42,986
We're fine.

1163
01:09:46,562 --> 01:09:50,123
<i>It's like he said. They
have all the time. We don't.</i>

1164
01:09:51,133 --> 01:09:53,658
We're gonna be fine.

1165
01:10:16,259 --> 01:10:18,591
Is that the Journal?
Yeah, 1949.

1166
01:10:18,661 --> 01:10:20,822
<i>Gerald Reed vs.
Lansing Tech.</i>

1167
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:22,590
Seems relevant, huh?

1168
01:10:22,665 --> 01:10:24,155
Seems like it to me.

1169
01:10:24,834 --> 01:10:27,894
<i>Dr. Kearns, I'm really
glad you're doing this.</i>

1170
01:10:28,104 --> 01:10:32,097
<i>The truth is, if you don't fight, the
rest of us will never stand a chance.</i>

1171
01:10:41,951 --> 01:10:42,975
Hey.
Hey.

1172
01:10:47,957 --> 01:10:49,618
How you doing?

1173
01:10:49,992 --> 01:10:51,789
Good. Mr. Lawson called.

1174
01:10:52,862 --> 01:10:55,854
Okay. Where are the kids?

1175
01:10:55,932 --> 01:10:57,456
I took them to Deb's.

1176
01:11:02,572 --> 01:11:05,166
<i>Okay. I'm gonna grab a...</i>

1177
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:11,869
Phyllis...

1178
01:11:11,948 --> 01:11:13,245
I wrote you a letter.

1179
01:11:15,952 --> 01:11:18,546
<i>And I threw it away, 'cause
I don't know what to say.</i>

1180
01:11:19,388 --> 01:11:21,913
<i>It's just become
so destructive.</i>

1181
01:11:21,991 --> 01:11:25,449
Okay, listen. I heard
everything you said last week,

1182
01:11:25,528 --> 01:11:27,894
<i>and I agree with it.
I'm trying to change...</i>

1183
01:11:27,964 --> 01:11:30,728
No, I know.
I know you want to change.

1184
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,927
<i>I don't think you know how.</i>

1185
01:11:33,035 --> 01:11:34,434
You can't.
This is just how it has to be.

1186
01:11:34,503 --> 01:11:35,492
Phyllis...

1187
01:11:35,571 --> 01:11:36,731
<i>I'm leaving.
No.</i>

1188
01:11:36,806 --> 01:11:40,401
Because I think this is the
right thing. Please understand.

1189
01:11:40,676 --> 01:11:43,839
This has overwhelmed us.
Goddamn it, I need you right now!

1190
01:11:43,946 --> 01:11:46,710
You've stopped supporting
me ever since I got home!

1191
01:11:46,782 --> 01:11:49,751
<i>You don't believe in this case
anymore. It's not, this isn't fair.</i>

1192
01:11:49,819 --> 01:11:51,980
<i>It's not fair!
It's not fair to me.</i>

1193
01:11:52,088 --> 01:11:55,785
<i>There are seven other people in this
house, and you just don't get it.</i>

1194
01:11:55,858 --> 01:11:58,986
We're close. We're so close.
They're calling us right now!

1195
01:11:59,061 --> 01:12:02,189
Honey. No.
Phyllis, no, Phyllis.

1196
01:12:02,331 --> 01:12:04,822
Come here.
We're okay.

1197
01:12:07,436 --> 01:12:09,336
<i>I can't do it without you.</i>

1198
01:12:09,405 --> 01:12:11,032
You're gonna be fine.

1199
01:12:11,941 --> 01:12:13,169
I can fix it.

1200
01:12:14,510 --> 01:12:20,107
Okay. You fix it.
And then we'll see, okay?

1201
01:12:21,684 --> 01:12:23,675
For now, this is best.

1202
01:12:24,086 --> 01:12:25,485
You still love me?

1203
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:29,355
I love you.

1204
01:12:38,634 --> 01:12:39,726
What did Lawson say?

1205
01:12:39,802 --> 01:12:44,171
He officially
resigned the case.

1206
01:13:47,870 --> 01:13:49,895
<i>Yeah, so, I'm going
back to my room real quick,</i>

1207
01:13:49,972 --> 01:13:51,030
and then I'll meet
you at the library.

1208
01:13:51,107 --> 01:13:52,404
Dennis?

1209
01:13:54,176 --> 01:13:55,234
Dad.

1210
01:13:57,012 --> 01:13:58,673
I'll catch up with you guys.

1211
01:13:58,748 --> 01:14:00,477
Yeah, see you later.

1212
01:14:02,852 --> 01:14:05,480
<i>Hey. What's going on?</i>

1213
01:14:05,554 --> 01:14:07,351
Can we get
a cup of coffee?

1214
01:14:08,758 --> 01:14:10,350
Sure. Yeah.

1215
01:14:13,596 --> 01:14:14,585
<i>It's a long article, Dad.</i>

1216
01:14:14,663 --> 01:14:16,688
Just keep reading.

1217
01:14:16,766 --> 01:14:18,063
Where?
Well, down here.

1218
01:14:18,134 --> 01:14:19,465
Look. Okay?

1219
01:14:20,636 --> 01:14:22,160
<i>"Among other things,
the new courts are</i>

1220
01:14:22,238 --> 01:14:24,229
<i>"designed to free up
the logjam of patent cases</i>

1221
01:14:24,306 --> 01:14:25,933
<i>"that have been clogging
the federal courts. "</i>

1222
01:14:26,008 --> 01:14:29,239
Do you know what that means?
We can actually get to court.

1223
01:14:30,045 --> 01:14:33,742
They've been waiting me out. They're
waiting for my patents to expire.

1224
01:14:33,816 --> 01:14:37,047
And if we can get them to court
soon, they lose a very big advantage.

1225
01:14:37,119 --> 01:14:40,816
How soon?
Months. Months, not years.

1226
01:14:43,192 --> 01:14:44,853
<i>That's great, Dad.</i>

1227
01:14:46,495 --> 01:14:49,293
<i>Well, I'm not ready yet.</i>

1228
01:14:49,365 --> 01:14:51,697
<i>And I can't do this by myself.</i>

1229
01:14:53,836 --> 01:14:55,235
Hey.

1230
01:14:55,304 --> 01:14:57,534
We used to talk about the Kearns
Corporation. You remember that?

1231
01:14:57,606 --> 01:14:58,937
That was a joke, Dad.

1232
01:14:59,008 --> 01:15:02,273
Not to me.
That was never a joke.

1233
01:15:02,344 --> 01:15:04,835
<i>We weren't a corporation.
We were a family.</i>

1234
01:15:05,314 --> 01:15:07,339
<i>We haven't even been that.</i>

1235
01:15:07,817 --> 01:15:13,756
I need help, Dennis. I submitted
a request to Ford for one document.

1236
01:15:14,924 --> 01:15:19,725
They sent me back 357 pages. I had to read
through every one to find the relevant page.

1237
01:15:21,297 --> 01:15:25,893
<i>That is all you care about. That's
all you ever cared about, Dad.</i>

1238
01:15:27,236 --> 01:15:30,137
Thanks for the coffee.
I gotta get to class.

1239
01:15:32,007 --> 01:15:34,134
<i>Okay. I'm fine.</i>

1240
01:15:34,276 --> 01:15:37,370
<i>Go ahead. Go to your class.
I don't need the help.</i>

1241
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:06,264
Can I help you?

1242
01:16:06,842 --> 01:16:08,070
I hope so.

1243
01:16:09,445 --> 01:16:13,347
Bob Kearns?
My name is Charlie Defao.

1244
01:16:14,350 --> 01:16:15,840
What do you want?

1245
01:16:15,985 --> 01:16:20,752
<i>A conversation. We tried calling, but
you don't answer your phone much, do you?</i>

1246
01:16:21,957 --> 01:16:23,117
Who are you?

1247
01:16:23,192 --> 01:16:25,626
<i>I'm here at the request
of the Ford Motor Company.</i>

1248
01:16:25,694 --> 01:16:28,356
You think we could go inside
and discuss a few things?

1249
01:16:28,430 --> 01:16:30,557
Discuss what?

1250
01:16:30,633 --> 01:16:32,863
How about putting
all this behind you?

1251
01:16:33,602 --> 01:16:35,160
So you can move
on with your life.

1252
01:16:35,237 --> 01:16:39,003
And so, frankly, Ford can stop
devoting so much time to your concerns.

1253
01:16:40,109 --> 01:16:41,872
Well, they can if they want.

1254
01:16:41,944 --> 01:16:43,070
They want.

1255
01:16:43,145 --> 01:16:46,444
And to prove it, they've authorized me
to come here and offer you a lot of money.

1256
01:16:46,515 --> 01:16:48,813
On top of your legal expenses.

1257
01:16:51,353 --> 01:16:52,342
I accept.

1258
01:16:53,689 --> 01:16:55,384
Excellent.

1259
01:16:55,457 --> 01:16:56,856
On one condition.

1260
01:16:58,127 --> 01:17:02,325
<i>As long as Ford takes out an
ad in the Detroit Free Press,</i>

1261
01:17:02,398 --> 01:17:04,059
<i>saying that they stole
Robert Kearns' invention,</i>

1262
01:17:04,133 --> 01:17:07,432
and have done everything they
can to deny me my day in court.

1263
01:17:09,004 --> 01:17:10,904
The only problem with that

1264
01:17:12,741 --> 01:17:14,834
<i>is that it'd
be a lie. Huh?</i>

1265
01:17:16,011 --> 01:17:18,206
To say they stole your
invention would be an insult.

1266
01:17:18,280 --> 01:17:21,647
To every engineer, stockholder, every
single man and woman at the company.

1267
01:17:21,717 --> 01:17:25,517
Bob, Ford is genuinely sorry
if you've ever felt mistreated.

1268
01:17:26,555 --> 01:17:29,353
And to resolve the situation, they're
willing to take the first step.

1269
01:17:29,425 --> 01:17:31,290
A big step.
Frankly, an amazing step.

1270
01:17:32,394 --> 01:17:33,918
A million dollar step.

1271
01:17:36,298 --> 01:17:39,392
I have work to do and
you're keeping me from it.

1272
01:17:40,402 --> 01:17:43,030
I hate to use these words,
but in this case,

1273
01:17:43,105 --> 01:17:45,665
this actually is a take
it or leave it offer.

1274
01:17:49,011 --> 01:17:51,741
<i>Bob, you don't want
this in court, okay?</i>

1275
01:17:54,116 --> 01:17:57,051
<i>Going to the law library's not
gonna make you a lawyer, Bob.</i>

1276
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:00,987
<i>Look, I'm gonna leave you my card,
okay? I've put my home number on it.</i>

1277
01:18:01,223 --> 01:18:04,192
So I want you to call
me anytime. Day or night.

1278
01:18:05,461 --> 01:18:06,758
<i>Doesn't matter.</i>

1279
01:18:07,663 --> 01:18:10,632
Just call me. I'll be waiting
for your call, Bob, okay?

1280
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,932
Just not for long.

1281
01:18:16,071 --> 01:18:17,060
Asshole.

1282
01:18:21,210 --> 01:18:22,199
Asshole.

1283
01:18:23,645 --> 01:18:26,045
There he is. Hey, Dad!

1284
01:18:26,148 --> 01:18:28,013
Hi, honey.

1285
01:18:29,351 --> 01:18:30,511
Hey, Dennis.

1286
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:33,247
Hey, Dad.

1287
01:18:33,322 --> 01:18:34,812
You want to come in?

1288
01:18:35,624 --> 01:18:38,252
No, I'll see you, okay?

1289
01:18:38,727 --> 01:18:41,855
Okay. How are you?

1290
01:18:42,097 --> 01:18:43,587
<i>I'm good.
Yeah?</i>

1291
01:18:43,699 --> 01:18:45,189
How you doing?

1292
01:18:45,734 --> 01:18:47,497
Dennis, hold up!

1293
01:18:51,673 --> 01:18:53,038
Hey.
Hey.

1294
01:18:54,643 --> 01:18:56,474
Thanks for bringing
Kathy over.

1295
01:18:56,545 --> 01:18:58,035
You're welcome.

1296
01:18:58,414 --> 01:19:01,850
Yeah. Thanks for bringing
her over the last time, too.

1297
01:19:01,917 --> 01:19:03,179
You know?

1298
01:19:05,621 --> 01:19:08,215
I know you've carried a pretty
big load for the family, Dennis.

1299
01:19:08,290 --> 01:19:10,781
<i>It's okay, Dad.</i>

1300
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:14,158
I just want you to know
you're pretty good at it.

1301
01:19:15,097 --> 01:19:17,588
You're better than
most guys I know.

1302
01:19:17,766 --> 01:19:19,666
Thank you.

1303
01:19:23,372 --> 01:19:24,600
I'll see you.

1304
01:19:25,641 --> 01:19:26,630
See you.

1305
01:19:29,244 --> 01:19:31,041
Everything all right?

1306
01:19:31,413 --> 01:19:33,881
What do you want to do?

1307
01:19:33,949 --> 01:19:36,349
<i>Don't you have a lot of work?
I just figured I'd help out.</i>

1308
01:19:36,418 --> 01:19:38,613
Hey, you work too much.

1309
01:19:39,755 --> 01:19:42,519
Too much typing.
Let's, go have some fun.

1310
01:19:43,692 --> 01:19:47,492
<i>I hear there's a... There's a
car show at the Historical Museum.</i>

1311
01:19:47,563 --> 01:19:48,928
We could...

1312
01:19:48,997 --> 01:19:51,022
Wow! That is something
different.

1313
01:19:51,133 --> 01:19:52,259
<i>Oh, that's very funny.</i>

1314
01:20:46,221 --> 01:20:47,347
Hey, Dad.

1315
01:20:47,422 --> 01:20:48,411
Oh!

1316
01:20:50,425 --> 01:20:52,359
You scared the hell out of me.

1317
01:20:52,961 --> 01:20:54,326
Sorry.

1318
01:20:55,063 --> 01:20:56,223
Yeah.

1319
01:21:00,469 --> 01:21:04,530
I got some coffees for us.
Looks like a long night.

1320
01:21:08,544 --> 01:21:12,446
Thank you.
Uh, yeah, son.

1321
01:21:15,150 --> 01:21:16,310
Right. Okay.

1322
01:21:16,552 --> 01:21:20,545
Mr. Finley, Dr. Kearns,
please step up into the well.

1323
01:21:21,790 --> 01:21:26,056
<i>Civil action, Robert Kearns vs. The Ford
Motor Company, will begin on August 14th.</i>

1324
01:21:26,128 --> 01:21:30,087
United States District Court for
the Eastern District of Michigan.

1325
01:21:30,165 --> 01:21:34,158
<i>So, Dr. Kearns, I'm not
sure why, since you seem like</i>

1326
01:21:34,236 --> 01:21:38,263
a reasonable man, but I understand
you'll be representing yourself.

1327
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:43,134
Yes, sir. My son Dennis
will be helping me out.

1328
01:21:43,712 --> 01:21:48,615
<i>Okay, then if you're up for it, let's make
it a good clean fight, shall we, gentlemen?</i>

1329
01:21:49,284 --> 01:21:51,218
Of course we will, Your Honor.

1330
01:21:52,254 --> 01:21:53,778
<i>I don't understand.</i>

1331
01:21:53,855 --> 01:21:56,153
<i>It's just an expression,
Dr. Kearns.</i>

1332
01:21:57,192 --> 01:21:59,820
August 14th.
We'll see you then.

1333
01:21:59,995 --> 01:22:03,831
Thank you very much,
Your Honor.

1334
01:22:07,669 --> 01:22:09,000
<i>How's Mom?</i>

1335
01:22:09,638 --> 01:22:10,798
<i>She's fine.</i>

1336
01:22:12,841 --> 01:22:14,274
You want the dates on these?

1337
01:22:16,545 --> 01:22:17,534
Yeah.

1338
01:22:17,613 --> 01:22:18,807
Quit your bitching.
You're only carrying one.

1339
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:19,869
Tough.

1340
01:22:19,948 --> 01:22:21,813
Hey, put those by the wall.
There you go.

1341
01:22:21,883 --> 01:22:23,646
Is it Chrysler?
Hell if I know.

1342
01:22:23,719 --> 01:22:27,348
Watch your language. She'll
be coming to the trial, right?

1343
01:22:27,723 --> 01:22:30,487
Look, Dad, I told you not to
get your hopes up about Mom.

1344
01:22:30,559 --> 01:22:33,926
Well, what does that mean?

1345
01:22:34,363 --> 01:22:36,194
You know what that means.

1346
01:22:37,132 --> 01:22:39,760
No, I really don't.

1347
01:22:40,402 --> 01:22:42,962
<i>She's busy. She's doing
a lot of substituting.</i>

1348
01:22:49,144 --> 01:22:51,009
Is she seeing someone?

1349
01:22:52,748 --> 01:22:55,148
<i>It's been four years, Dad.</i>

1350
01:22:55,217 --> 01:22:57,447
<i>Well, that's not
an answer, Kath.</i>

1351
01:23:00,522 --> 01:23:06,119
<i>Well, anyway, it's okay. Just
let her know. It'd be nice.</i>

1352
01:23:06,228 --> 01:23:07,388
Mmm.

1353
01:23:17,239 --> 01:23:18,536
What a piece of crap.

1354
01:23:18,607 --> 01:23:20,040
<i>It's perfect.</i>

1355
01:23:32,087 --> 01:23:36,990
<i>Hi, Phyllis. Um, I know it's
late. The kids are asleep,</i>

1356
01:23:38,593 --> 01:23:42,393
and I think I've been putting off
this call hoping you would be, too.

1357
01:23:42,831 --> 01:23:48,064
I just wanted you to know
that the trial starts tomorrow.

1358
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:54,401
Okay. Good-bye.

1359
01:24:10,025 --> 01:24:11,117
Hey, Dad!

1360
01:24:11,193 --> 01:24:13,161
Hey, Dad wait up!

1361
01:24:13,228 --> 01:24:14,661
Hey. How are you?

1362
01:24:14,730 --> 01:24:16,061
Good. How are you?
Hello, Patrick.

1363
01:24:16,131 --> 01:24:18,224
<i>Hey.
I'm doing pretty good.</i>

1364
01:24:21,002 --> 01:24:23,163
You get some rest?
Oh, a little bit.

1365
01:24:23,338 --> 01:24:28,037
Most of the testimony you'll be hearing at
this trial will be highly technical in nature.

1366
01:24:28,110 --> 01:24:32,137
Although you may have noticed a
less technical piece of evidence

1367
01:24:32,247 --> 01:24:34,772
in the form of half
of an automobile.

1368
01:24:35,817 --> 01:24:39,048
The plaintiff in this case
is Dr. Robert Kearns.

1369
01:24:39,121 --> 01:24:44,024
Dr. Kearns charges that the Ford Motor
Company infringed five patents that he holds.

1370
01:24:44,126 --> 01:24:47,391
<i>If you decide in Dr. Kearns'
favor, you will also decide</i>

1371
01:24:47,496 --> 01:24:50,556
what damages, if any,
are due to Dr. Kearns.

1372
01:24:51,266 --> 01:24:55,498
Dr. Kearns has voluntarily chosen
to represent himself at this trial.

1373
01:24:55,604 --> 01:25:00,041
You are not to draw any inferences
either for or against Dr. Kearns,

1374
01:25:00,308 --> 01:25:04,210
simply because he is representing
himself. Yes, Dr. Kearns?

1375
01:25:05,514 --> 01:25:10,213
I just wanted to thank you for
allowing me to represent myself

1376
01:25:10,285 --> 01:25:12,446
and introduce my son,
Dennis Kearns.

1377
01:25:15,891 --> 01:25:17,984
Is that all, Dr. Kearns?

1378
01:25:18,493 --> 01:25:22,088
I appreciate the jury giving their
time to the community like this.

1379
01:25:22,564 --> 01:25:25,465
The jury is the
conscience of the community.

1380
01:25:28,770 --> 01:25:30,397
Are you finished?

1381
01:25:30,705 --> 01:25:34,072
<i>You might be more comfortable
seated, don't you think?</i>

1382
01:25:35,143 --> 01:25:39,079
Please keep in mind you're not to discuss
what you hear at this trial with anyone else.

1383
01:25:39,181 --> 01:25:41,615
Not amongst yourselves, not in the
jury room, not in the hallway...

1384
01:25:41,683 --> 01:25:46,347
Now, this array of electronic parts
and this combination of circuitry

1385
01:25:46,421 --> 01:25:50,619
has been used by American auto
manufacturers since the 1950s.

1386
01:25:50,959 --> 01:25:53,723
Obviously since Ford
engineers designed it,

1387
01:25:53,795 --> 01:25:56,423
they had knowledge of it long before
their first meeting with Dr. Kearns...

1388
01:25:56,498 --> 01:25:59,126
Would you agree that Dr. Kearns
was the first person in the world,

1389
01:25:59,201 --> 01:26:00,930
to your knowledge,
to propose that combination?

1390
01:26:01,002 --> 01:26:04,836
<i>I believe it's possible that
it was Motorola and Ranco.</i>

1391
01:26:05,273 --> 01:26:06,399
<i>They may have.
The motor makes one</i>

1392
01:26:06,475 --> 01:26:09,535
<i>revolution to get one wipe out
of 360 degrees. It's very simple.</i>

1393
01:26:09,611 --> 01:26:11,010
<i>We worked on that
for two weeks.</i>

1394
01:26:11,079 --> 01:26:14,310
<i>Well, certainly it is important to
understand that within the Ford organization,</i>

1395
01:26:14,382 --> 01:26:15,713
<i>it takes some time
to get written...</i>

1396
01:26:15,784 --> 01:26:18,719
<i>Well, when you start the car, the
transistors come on automatically</i>

1397
01:26:18,787 --> 01:26:21,415
<i>and supply 50 times
as much current.</i>

1398
01:26:21,723 --> 01:26:25,853
To reiterate, you've worked in the
automobile industry for well over 20 years

1399
01:26:25,927 --> 01:26:29,795
and you've been an executive at the company
for a number of those years, correct?

1400
01:26:29,865 --> 01:26:31,457
<i>That's correct.</i>

1401
01:26:31,666 --> 01:26:36,000
Mr. Tyler, to be clear,
did you ever tell Mr. Kearns

1402
01:26:36,071 --> 01:26:39,302
<i>that he had, quote,
"Won the wiper competition"?</i>

1403
01:26:40,175 --> 01:26:45,203
<i>It doesn't sound much like me, so, no, I
really don't recall making that comment.</i>

1404
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:48,740
I mean, I certainly tried to be encouraging
to Mr. Kearns. I respected the man.

1405
01:26:48,817 --> 01:26:52,309
Hell, I still do, but to say
that there was a competition

1406
01:26:52,387 --> 01:26:55,481
is, I think,
pretty big stretch.

1407
01:26:55,557 --> 01:26:58,048
<i>I should also point out that
Mr. Kearns's apparent intention</i>

1408
01:26:58,126 --> 01:27:00,390
was to manufacture
his device himself.

1409
01:27:00,896 --> 01:27:03,126
That simply would have
been impossible for us.

1410
01:27:03,198 --> 01:27:06,565
<i>So, to be clear, there's no
chance that Ford would have ever</i>

1411
01:27:06,635 --> 01:27:11,231
entertained the notion of Mr. Kearns
manufacturing his own windshield wiper?

1412
01:27:11,306 --> 01:27:13,103
No chance.

1413
01:27:13,174 --> 01:27:17,076
Ford putting its name in the
hands of an inexperienced supplier?

1414
01:27:17,946 --> 01:27:20,073
That would have been a
disaster waiting to happen.

1415
01:27:20,148 --> 01:27:22,776
Thank you, Mr. Tyler.

1416
01:27:25,654 --> 01:27:28,179
Dr. Kearns?
Your witness.

1417
01:27:38,333 --> 01:27:41,860
Mr. Tyler, did you ever
ask Dr. Kearns to

1418
01:27:41,937 --> 01:27:45,270
come up with a cost
unit basis for his wiper?

1419
01:27:45,874 --> 01:27:48,707
<i>I don't recall specifically
everything I asked him.</i>

1420
01:27:48,777 --> 01:27:50,608
I may have asked him.

1421
01:27:50,679 --> 01:27:53,910
Well, why would you
have asked for that?

1422
01:27:53,982 --> 01:27:58,646
If I did, it would have been because Mr.
Kearns was going on and on about manufacturing,

1423
01:27:59,020 --> 01:28:02,285
and I would have been trying
to point out the impossibility.

1424
01:28:02,524 --> 01:28:04,651
<i>Well, wouldn't asking a
question like that...</i>

1425
01:28:04,726 --> 01:28:08,856
Unless you have a document to hand to
the witness please stay at the lectern.

1426
01:28:09,531 --> 01:28:12,967
Uh, what...

1427
01:28:13,034 --> 01:28:17,971
<i>Well, wouldn't asking a question
like that imply a contract or a,</i>

1428
01:28:18,039 --> 01:28:19,939
an agreement of some sort?

1429
01:28:20,008 --> 01:28:23,944
<i>No, not really. Uh, I'd say it's no
more a commitment to buy his wipers</i>

1430
01:28:24,012 --> 01:28:28,244
<i>than I would be committed to buy someone's
tie if I asked him how much it cost.</i>

1431
01:28:30,452 --> 01:28:33,421
Did you ever ask Dr. Kearns
how much his tie cost?

1432
01:28:34,222 --> 01:28:37,714
<i>No, not that I recall, and I'm
not sure he was even wearing one.</i>

1433
01:28:37,792 --> 01:28:40,556
But you did ask him how
much his wiper cost, right?

1434
01:28:40,629 --> 01:28:43,894
Like I said, in a rhetorical
way, it may have been possible.

1435
01:28:44,299 --> 01:28:47,029
<i>So it's not the same as
a tie at all, is it?</i>

1436
01:28:48,003 --> 01:28:49,470
<i>I'm sorry. What?</i>

1437
01:28:49,537 --> 01:28:50,629
Thank you.

1438
01:28:53,575 --> 01:28:56,669
You have a Ph. D in electronic
engineering, is that correct?

1439
01:28:56,745 --> 01:28:59,646
<i>Uh, that's correct. I've taught
for the past several years...</i>

1440
01:28:59,714 --> 01:29:02,308
<i>No, that's fine, sir. Your credentials
are already part of the record.</i>

1441
01:29:02,384 --> 01:29:07,344
<i>Now, when you said earlier that Mr.
Kearns didn't create anything new,</i>

1442
01:29:07,422 --> 01:29:09,322
could you explain what
you meant by that?

1443
01:29:09,391 --> 01:29:11,484
Yes. As you can see,

1444
01:29:11,626 --> 01:29:14,823
<i>Dr. Kearns's basic
unit consists of a capacitor</i>

1445
01:29:14,896 --> 01:29:17,421
a variable resistor
and a transistor.

1446
01:29:17,565 --> 01:29:20,193
Now, these are basic building
blocks in electronics.

1447
01:29:20,268 --> 01:29:23,169
You can find them
in any catalog.

1448
01:29:23,238 --> 01:29:27,971
All Mr. Kearns did was to arrange
them in a new pattern, you might say.

1449
01:29:28,043 --> 01:29:33,208
<i>And that, that's not the same thing
as inventing something new, however.</i>

1450
01:29:33,348 --> 01:29:35,714
Did Mr. Kearns
invent the transistor?

1451
01:29:36,184 --> 01:29:37,811
No, sir, he did not.

1452
01:29:37,886 --> 01:29:40,252
Did Mr. Kearns
invent the capacitor?

1453
01:29:40,321 --> 01:29:42,255
Again, no, he did not.

1454
01:29:42,323 --> 01:29:44,450
Did Mr. Kearns invent
the variable resistor?

1455
01:29:44,526 --> 01:29:46,460
No, he did not.
Thank you, Professor.

1456
01:29:46,528 --> 01:29:48,257
You may step
down, Professor Chapman.

1457
01:29:48,329 --> 01:29:50,058
We will resume
testimony after lunch.

1458
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:54,792
Dr. Kearns, your
cross-examination, please.

1459
01:29:56,838 --> 01:29:57,827
Dr. Kearns.

1460
01:29:57,906 --> 01:29:59,396
Yes, sir.

1461
01:30:06,448 --> 01:30:07,608
Oh.

1462
01:30:15,590 --> 01:30:19,526
<i>I have here a book.
It's by Charles Dickens.</i>

1463
01:30:19,594 --> 01:30:21,755
<i>It's called
A Tale of Two Cities.</i>

1464
01:30:22,564 --> 01:30:24,122
Have you, have you
ever read this book?

1465
01:30:24,199 --> 01:30:26,326
<i>Objection, Your Honor.
It's not relevant.</i>

1466
01:30:26,401 --> 01:30:28,301
Your Honor, please,
if I could just continue?

1467
01:30:28,369 --> 01:30:30,269
How long will it take to
get to the point, Doctor?

1468
01:30:30,338 --> 01:30:31,737
Not very long at all.

1469
01:30:31,806 --> 01:30:33,933
<i>Okay. Let's see
what happens.</i>

1470
01:30:34,776 --> 01:30:35,936
Have you ever read this?

1471
01:30:36,010 --> 01:30:38,877
Yes. Read it in high
school. Very good book.

1472
01:30:39,047 --> 01:30:43,677
<i>Yes, it is. I'd like to read you
the first, few words, if I may.</i>

1473
01:30:43,752 --> 01:30:47,210
<i>"It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times,</i>

1474
01:30:47,288 --> 01:30:51,554
<i>"it was the age of wisdom, it
was the age of foolishness. "</i>

1475
01:30:51,926 --> 01:30:54,053
<i>Let's start with the
first word, "It. "</i>

1476
01:30:54,129 --> 01:30:56,324
Did Charles Dickens
create that word?

1477
01:30:56,464 --> 01:30:58,489
No.

1478
01:30:58,566 --> 01:31:00,124
No.
What about "was"?

1479
01:31:00,235 --> 01:31:03,466
Your Honor, is Mr. Kearns gonna
go through the whole dictionary?

1480
01:31:03,538 --> 01:31:06,735
Please, if I could just
continue. I do have a point.

1481
01:31:08,877 --> 01:31:10,708
You may answer the question.

1482
01:31:10,779 --> 01:31:11,939
No.

1483
01:31:12,013 --> 01:31:13,241
<i>"The"?</i>

1484
01:31:13,314 --> 01:31:14,645
<i>No.
"Best"?</i>

1485
01:31:14,716 --> 01:31:16,411
<i>No.
"Times"?</i>

1486
01:31:16,785 --> 01:31:19,015
Look. I got a dictionary here.

1487
01:31:19,187 --> 01:31:21,781
<i>I haven't checked,
but I would guess that</i>

1488
01:31:21,856 --> 01:31:24,916
<i>every word that's in this book
can be found in this dictionary.</i>

1489
01:31:24,993 --> 01:31:26,722
<i>Well, I suspect that's
probably true.</i>

1490
01:31:26,795 --> 01:31:29,355
<i>Okay, so then you agree
that there's not,</i>

1491
01:31:29,430 --> 01:31:32,695
probably a single
new word in this book.

1492
01:31:33,101 --> 01:31:36,195
<i>Well, I don't know,
but that's probably true.</i>

1493
01:31:36,704 --> 01:31:40,970
<i>All Charles Dickens did was arrange them
into a new pattern, isn't that right?</i>

1494
01:31:42,010 --> 01:31:45,537
Well, I admit I haven't,
thought about it in that way.

1495
01:31:45,847 --> 01:31:48,611
<i>But Dickens did create
something new, didn't he?</i>

1496
01:31:48,683 --> 01:31:50,116
By using words.

1497
01:31:50,185 --> 01:31:53,848
The only tools that
were available to him.

1498
01:31:56,591 --> 01:32:01,153
Just as almost all inventors in
history have had to use the tools that

1499
01:32:01,229 --> 01:32:03,789
were available to them.

1500
01:32:03,865 --> 01:32:06,959
Telephones, space satellites
all of these were made from

1501
01:32:07,035 --> 01:32:09,868
parts that already existed,
correct, Professor?

1502
01:32:10,371 --> 01:32:12,862
Parts that you might buy
out of a catalog.

1503
01:32:13,508 --> 01:32:14,998
<i>Technically that's true,
yes, but that does...</i>

1504
01:32:15,076 --> 01:32:17,067
No further questions.

1505
01:32:17,145 --> 01:32:19,340
You may step
down, Professor Chapman.

1506
01:32:21,783 --> 01:32:24,581
Dad, how old do you
think that Finley guy is?

1507
01:32:24,819 --> 01:32:26,286
<i>I don't know.</i>

1508
01:32:26,354 --> 01:32:27,582
Hey, Dr. Kearns?

1509
01:32:27,655 --> 01:32:28,883
I brought some guys
from the inventors club.

1510
01:32:28,957 --> 01:32:31,755
<i>Oh, that's great, Louis.
See you in there.</i>

1511
01:32:32,894 --> 01:32:33,883
Hey, Dad!

1512
01:32:33,962 --> 01:32:35,827
Oh, there you are.
Hey.

1513
01:32:36,297 --> 01:32:37,855
How you guys doing?
Hey. Good. How are you doing?

1514
01:32:37,932 --> 01:32:39,092
Hi, Dad.
Good.

1515
01:32:39,167 --> 01:32:40,634
Hey.

1516
01:32:41,402 --> 01:32:42,391
How are you?

1517
01:32:42,470 --> 01:32:43,937
Yeah, good. Good.

1518
01:32:44,005 --> 01:32:46,735
I guess I should be thinking
about going to law school.

1519
01:32:46,808 --> 01:32:48,571
<i>They said it's been
going great. I'm glad.</i>

1520
01:32:48,643 --> 01:32:50,770
Yeah. Thank you for coming.

1521
01:32:51,179 --> 01:32:53,340
Sure.
Go. Go.

1522
01:32:53,414 --> 01:32:54,540
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll see you.

1523
01:32:54,616 --> 01:32:55,708
A minute, Dennis.

1524
01:32:55,783 --> 01:32:58,809
Okay. Bye, sweets. Okay.
Okay. Bye, Mom, see you later.

1525
01:33:00,321 --> 01:33:02,312
<i>All right, let's go.</i>

1526
01:33:02,390 --> 01:33:04,551
<i>Dr. Kearns
is our next witness.</i>

1527
01:33:04,759 --> 01:33:07,751
Because Dr. Kearns is
representing himself,

1528
01:33:07,829 --> 01:33:11,094
he is obligated to proceed
in a question and answer form.

1529
01:33:11,699 --> 01:33:15,328
It may seem a little odd, but
you must carefully distinguish

1530
01:33:15,403 --> 01:33:18,668
between the question being
asked and the answer being given.

1531
01:33:19,007 --> 01:33:20,497
Dr. Kearns?

1532
01:33:20,575 --> 01:33:22,133
Thank you, Your Honor.

1533
01:33:22,277 --> 01:33:24,040
<i>Dad, don't forget the jury.</i>

1534
01:33:31,452 --> 01:33:34,717
Could you please state your
name and tell us where you live?

1535
01:33:38,092 --> 01:33:41,550
My name is Dr. Robert Kearns
and I live in Detroit, Michigan.

1536
01:33:42,130 --> 01:33:44,030
Do you need my address?

1537
01:33:47,135 --> 01:33:50,366
<i>No, that won't be necessary,
but we would like a...</i>

1538
01:33:50,438 --> 01:33:53,373
<i>Dr. Kearns. Why don't
you just have a seat?</i>

1539
01:33:53,441 --> 01:33:55,841
Relax and do your
examination from there.

1540
01:34:01,983 --> 01:34:03,075
Thank you.

1541
01:34:05,887 --> 01:34:09,482
<i>Dr. Kearns, was the Intermittent
Wiper your first invention?</i>

1542
01:34:10,625 --> 01:34:13,116
No, it was not, but it
was probably my best.

1543
01:34:13,194 --> 01:34:16,186
<i>Objection, Your Honor.
Counsel's leading the witness.</i>

1544
01:34:16,698 --> 01:34:20,691
What? Overruled. Proceed.

1545
01:34:21,135 --> 01:34:25,572
<i>Thank you. Uh, could you describe
for the court your first invention?</i>

1546
01:34:27,075 --> 01:34:29,305
My first invention
was in college.

1547
01:34:29,377 --> 01:34:32,938
Back then, uh, yellow margarine,
because of the dairy lobby,

1548
01:34:33,014 --> 01:34:36,882
<i>couldn't be sold in stores, because
it would look like, like butter.</i>

1549
01:34:38,853 --> 01:34:44,223
So I came up with a bag, basically a
plastic bag, with a little seal on the top,

1550
01:34:44,292 --> 01:34:47,261
and you would insert
a tab of yellow dye

1551
01:34:47,328 --> 01:34:49,796
in order to make the margarine
appear to look like butter.

1552
01:34:49,864 --> 01:34:50,922
Dr. Kearns.

1553
01:34:50,999 --> 01:34:52,432
But it wasn't.
It was margarine.

1554
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:54,764
Could we move on to the reason
why we're all here? The wiper?

1555
01:34:54,836 --> 01:35:00,297
<i>Yes. Yes. Yes. Could you, Dr.
Kearns, please explain your concept</i>

1556
01:35:00,375 --> 01:35:02,400
<i>for the Intermittent Wiper?</i>

1557
01:35:02,844 --> 01:35:06,712
In 1941, the Supreme Court
came up with the notion that,

1558
01:35:06,781 --> 01:35:11,616
somewhere in the process of inventing, the
inventor must experience some sort moment.

1559
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:17,419
<i>What they called "a flash of genius,"
in order to qualify for a patent.</i>

1560
01:35:18,426 --> 01:35:22,487
And I probably owe
my flash to my honeymoon.

1561
01:35:24,232 --> 01:35:28,134
I was very much in love, and my
wife Phyllis and I were at a hotel.

1562
01:35:28,269 --> 01:35:32,035
And I was opening a bottle of
champagne and not paying attention.

1563
01:35:33,574 --> 01:35:35,940
I was probably thinking
how lucky I was.

1564
01:35:36,444 --> 01:35:39,971
And popped the cork and it
went off, hit me in the eye.

1565
01:35:40,048 --> 01:35:42,073
This one right here.
About knocked me out.

1566
01:35:42,150 --> 01:35:46,484
I was bleeding everywhere and
they operated on me that night.

1567
01:35:46,687 --> 01:35:51,351
And they saved my eye. And the first
thing I saw the next morning was Phyllis.

1568
01:35:52,994 --> 01:35:56,486
<i>Yeah. I'm legally
blind in my left eye,</i>

1569
01:35:56,564 --> 01:36:00,022
and I've thought about the human
eye because of that ever since.

1570
01:36:02,837 --> 01:36:07,103
And years ago, I was riding back
from church with my family and

1571
01:36:07,175 --> 01:36:09,575
it was drizzling outside,
and I had a thought.

1572
01:36:09,644 --> 01:36:14,240
<i>Why couldn't a wiper
work like an eyelid?</i>

1573
01:36:17,318 --> 01:36:19,718
<i>Why couldn't it blink?</i>

1574
01:36:22,723 --> 01:36:24,623
<i>That's how I came up with it.</i>

1575
01:36:29,197 --> 01:36:31,825
Hello, jury.

1576
01:36:32,300 --> 01:36:35,326
Why are you here?
What are you doing here?

1577
01:36:35,870 --> 01:36:38,668
What am I doing here?
What are we all doing here?

1578
01:36:40,508 --> 01:36:43,534
<i>I'm here because my mother
and father and their</i>

1579
01:36:45,146 --> 01:36:46,272
mother and father and
Uncle Wiggly and...

1580
01:36:51,686 --> 01:36:54,746
Good evening, Dennis.
My name is Charlie Defao.

1581
01:36:55,056 --> 01:36:56,956
I know who you are.

1582
01:36:57,024 --> 01:36:59,515
Right. May I come in?

1583
01:37:00,728 --> 01:37:02,093
Let him in, son.

1584
01:37:08,436 --> 01:37:10,768
Hello, Bob.
Mr. Defao.

1585
01:37:12,306 --> 01:37:13,534
Good evening.

1586
01:37:18,779 --> 01:37:22,044
Bob, what do you say,

1587
01:37:22,116 --> 01:37:26,576
<i>we take the guesswork and the anxiety out
of the situation, for everybody's sake?</i>

1588
01:37:27,488 --> 01:37:28,785
Can we do that?

1589
01:37:28,856 --> 01:37:29,982
<i>What's going on?</i>

1590
01:37:30,057 --> 01:37:31,456
No, just...

1591
01:37:31,993 --> 01:37:36,089
Bob, $30 million.

1592
01:37:36,164 --> 01:37:38,132
Thirty million?
Yep.

1593
01:37:38,199 --> 01:37:42,158
<i>I'm here tonight to offer your father,
essentially this family, that much money.</i>

1594
01:37:42,236 --> 01:37:44,431
<i>The trial goes away.
We don't leave this to a jury.</i>

1595
01:37:44,505 --> 01:37:46,996
We settle this here tonight.

1596
01:37:47,141 --> 01:37:50,269
But no statement
of my invention?

1597
01:37:50,344 --> 01:37:52,574
Or, or the time or energy,
my ruined reputation...

1598
01:37:52,647 --> 01:37:54,376
And more money than you
can have ever imagined.

1599
01:37:54,448 --> 01:37:57,781
Bob, I am telling you, if you
trust this to a Detroit jury,

1600
01:37:57,852 --> 01:38:00,013
you could walk
away with nothing.

1601
01:38:00,188 --> 01:38:02,748
Okay? Now, look
at these guys.

1602
01:38:02,823 --> 01:38:06,259
Can you imagine what that
would mean for their future?

1603
01:38:14,602 --> 01:38:17,628
What do you kids think?
I've put you through all this.

1604
01:38:19,907 --> 01:38:23,468
You've certainly earned the right
to say anything you want to say.

1605
01:38:28,216 --> 01:38:29,205
Timmy?

1606
01:38:30,251 --> 01:38:32,776
<i>I don't know, Dad.
It's a shitload of money.</i>

1607
01:38:35,356 --> 01:38:36,983
<i>Don't do it, Dad.</i>

1608
01:38:38,693 --> 01:38:40,991
Hell with it, Dad.
We've come this far.

1609
01:38:42,296 --> 01:38:44,730
<i>Well, Mr. Defao, you don't
have much luck in this house.</i>

1610
01:38:44,799 --> 01:38:46,289
Bob, let me ask...

1611
01:38:46,367 --> 01:38:50,064
No. I'll see you tomorrow.

1612
01:38:51,739 --> 01:38:57,075
This is insane. I mean 20 years of
litigating, this family takes the cake.

1613
01:39:03,985 --> 01:39:06,385
<i>Well, gentlemen, I'm looking
forward to your final arguments.</i>

1614
01:39:06,454 --> 01:39:08,012
Dr. Kearns, Mr. Finley.

1615
01:39:08,089 --> 01:39:11,320
The defense would like to recall
a witness to the stand, Your Honor.

1616
01:39:11,392 --> 01:39:13,155
Mr. Robert Kearns.

1617
01:39:13,294 --> 01:39:15,694
No! Is that procedure?

1618
01:39:15,763 --> 01:39:16,991
Is this really necessary?

1619
01:39:17,064 --> 01:39:18,998
I have to say that I certainly
think it is, Your Honor.

1620
01:39:19,066 --> 01:39:21,899
We'll be brief,
but it is quite pertinent.

1621
01:39:21,969 --> 01:39:23,960
<i>Your Honor, I'm ready for
my summary right now.</i>

1622
01:39:24,038 --> 01:39:26,097
Well, it'll have
to wait, Dr. Kearns.

1623
01:39:26,173 --> 01:39:27,765
Please take the stand.

1624
01:39:35,283 --> 01:39:38,514
Please keep in mind you're
still under oath, Dr. Kearns.

1625
01:39:42,390 --> 01:39:46,019
Mr. Kearns, you have
testified here that Mr. Tyler

1626
01:39:46,127 --> 01:39:50,291
<i>told you that you had, quote,
"won the wiper competition. "</i>

1627
01:39:51,432 --> 01:39:52,490
Yes.

1628
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:56,026
<i>And you firmly believe that
that's the truth, don't you?</i>

1629
01:39:56,103 --> 01:39:57,764
Yes, I do.

1630
01:39:57,838 --> 01:40:01,706
<i>It couldn't have been
something that misheard?</i>

1631
01:40:02,643 --> 01:40:03,735
Something that
you imagined?

1632
01:40:03,811 --> 01:40:04,800
No.

1633
01:40:05,713 --> 01:40:10,616
Do you recall being removed from a bus
in Maryland by police four years ago?

1634
01:40:13,387 --> 01:40:14,376
Yes.

1635
01:40:14,455 --> 01:40:17,583
And do you remember what you
told the officers at the time?

1636
01:40:17,658 --> 01:40:20,286
That you were on your way to
Washington, D.C. And

1637
01:40:20,361 --> 01:40:22,226
that it was at the request
of the White House?

1638
01:40:22,296 --> 01:40:24,287
Do you remember
that, Mr. Kearns?

1639
01:40:26,133 --> 01:40:27,327
Yes. And at that time...

1640
01:40:27,401 --> 01:40:28,800
Just answer the
questions please.

1641
01:40:28,869 --> 01:40:31,394
Was it at the request
of the Vice President?

1642
01:40:33,974 --> 01:40:35,066
No, it was not.

1643
01:40:35,142 --> 01:40:38,111
And were you subsequently treated
for a nervous breakdown and

1644
01:40:38,179 --> 01:40:40,477
confined to the Rockville
State Mental Facility?

1645
01:40:40,548 --> 01:40:41,606
Yes.

1646
01:40:41,682 --> 01:40:44,708
And that was because you
were mentally unstable, right?

1647
01:40:45,219 --> 01:40:47,380
I was seeking medical
treatment at the time.

1648
01:40:47,455 --> 01:40:49,719
But you were convinced
that the White House

1649
01:40:49,790 --> 01:40:52,759
<i>wanted you to come to
Washington, D.C., weren't you?</i>

1650
01:40:53,060 --> 01:40:54,118
Yes.

1651
01:40:54,261 --> 01:40:59,426
Just as you were convinced that Mr. Tyler
told you that you won the wiper competition.

1652
01:41:00,835 --> 01:41:03,531
Thank you, Mr. Kearns.
No further questions.

1653
01:41:09,844 --> 01:41:13,473
<i>I'm gonna get a soda or something.
You guys want anything? Dad?</i>

1654
01:41:20,421 --> 01:41:22,150
Fuck Charlie Defao.

1655
01:41:28,596 --> 01:41:32,157
<i>I took some time off yesterday
and went to my mother's for dinner.</i>

1656
01:41:33,234 --> 01:41:35,634
On the way over there,
I thought back to

1657
01:41:35,770 --> 01:41:39,171
how when I was a kid my mother
used to make lemon meringue pie.

1658
01:41:39,273 --> 01:41:41,639
But not just any old
lemon meringue pie.

1659
01:41:42,076 --> 01:41:45,341
The best lemon meringue
pie in the world.

1660
01:41:45,479 --> 01:41:47,413
See, she had one of
those hand squeezers,

1661
01:41:47,481 --> 01:41:51,474
and she would crank out that
lemon juice, all for that pie.

1662
01:41:53,687 --> 01:41:56,656
After I finished school and I started
making my own way in the world,

1663
01:41:56,724 --> 01:42:01,286
one of the first things I did is I went out
and I bought my mother an electric juicer.

1664
01:42:01,729 --> 01:42:03,629
And you know what?

1665
01:42:03,998 --> 01:42:06,364
She still makes the best lemon
meringue pie in the world.

1666
01:42:06,434 --> 01:42:11,428
And it would never occur to me,
to claim credit for that pie.

1667
01:42:13,707 --> 01:42:16,141
<i>And that's what this
case is all about.</i>

1668
01:42:17,812 --> 01:42:20,178
Who really baked
that lemon pie?

1669
01:42:21,148 --> 01:42:24,709
And there is no question,
what the evidence shows.

1670
01:42:24,785 --> 01:42:28,243
Who engineered,
designed and tested

1671
01:42:28,355 --> 01:42:33,224
windshield wipers with the
self-parking features back in the 1940s?

1672
01:42:33,294 --> 01:42:35,455
Ford Motor Company.

1673
01:42:35,529 --> 01:42:39,932
Who engineered, tested, produced
and sold windshield wipers

1674
01:42:40,034 --> 01:42:43,663
<i>with what was called "depressed
park" back in the 1940s?</i>

1675
01:42:43,871 --> 01:42:46,203
Ford Motor Company.

1676
01:42:46,273 --> 01:42:51,734
Now, I am truly proud of a system where
a layman, a dedicated college professor,

1677
01:42:51,812 --> 01:42:56,647
who has taught for many years, can
come in here and state his case.

1678
01:42:57,952 --> 01:43:00,944
Unfortunately, as we
have proven earlier,

1679
01:43:01,021 --> 01:43:04,821
he sometimes confuses
reality with fiction.

1680
01:43:06,660 --> 01:43:09,925
Fortunately, he has sought
professional help in those cases.

1681
01:43:12,199 --> 01:43:16,295
But the sad fact of the matter
is that Robert Kearns,

1682
01:43:16,370 --> 01:43:20,568
a good and decent man, has
dragged us all into this courtroom

1683
01:43:20,708 --> 01:43:24,337
over patents that have
been proven invalid.

1684
01:43:25,112 --> 01:43:30,209
<i>Invalid. And that's what
this case is all about.</i>

1685
01:43:31,852 --> 01:43:35,652
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
for your time and attention.

1686
01:43:36,924 --> 01:43:41,657
Oh, and you want to know who really
baked that lemon meringue pie?

1687
01:43:44,131 --> 01:43:48,500
Ford Motor Company.
Thank you.

1688
01:43:50,404 --> 01:43:52,235
Dr. Kearns.

1689
01:43:56,644 --> 01:43:59,374
<i>Okay, Dad, let's go.</i>

1690
01:44:04,552 --> 01:44:07,612
<i>One of Mr. Finley's
facts is undeniable,</i>

1691
01:44:08,556 --> 01:44:11,354
I never baked a lemon meringue
pie in my entire life.

1692
01:44:20,134 --> 01:44:21,795
<i>Why are we here?</i>

1693
01:44:23,337 --> 01:44:25,532
<i>I am asking why
you and I are here.</i>

1694
01:44:29,577 --> 01:44:31,374
<i>Why have our lives crossed?</i>

1695
01:44:36,250 --> 01:44:38,150
<i>Well, one thing
I can tell you.</i>

1696
01:44:38,218 --> 01:44:40,618
We are not here
because of anything

1697
01:44:40,721 --> 01:44:44,248
<i>Ford did or didn't do
back in the 1940s.</i>

1698
01:44:47,027 --> 01:44:50,087
Mr. Finley over here has made it
an art out of talking about all

1699
01:44:50,164 --> 01:44:51,995
<i>the things that
I didn't invent.</i>

1700
01:44:53,634 --> 01:44:56,899
But what Mr. Finley
has a very hard time

1701
01:44:56,971 --> 01:44:59,769
talking about are
the things I did invent.

1702
01:45:01,208 --> 01:45:04,769
<i>And why is that? Because
he can't, that is why.</i>

1703
01:45:08,515 --> 01:45:13,475
But we are here because
the Ford Motor Company,

1704
01:45:14,722 --> 01:45:21,491
used their influence, and their
money, and all their corporate power

1705
01:45:21,562 --> 01:45:23,587
to take advantage
of the situation.

1706
01:45:24,331 --> 01:45:28,062
Ladies and gentlemen, what
they did was downright wrong.

1707
01:45:29,203 --> 01:45:31,933
<i>They claimed another
man's work for their own.</i>

1708
01:45:33,374 --> 01:45:39,108
And now, all these years
later, after getting caught,

1709
01:45:41,448 --> 01:45:44,611
they have the arrogance to sit
here and look you in the eye

1710
01:45:44,685 --> 01:45:48,587
<i>and say, "No, no, no, the Ford, Ford
Company didn't do anything wrong. "</i>

1711
01:45:49,490 --> 01:45:52,288
No, they knew it all along.

1712
01:45:52,393 --> 01:45:55,885
They, had everything they
needed to build this invention.

1713
01:45:57,665 --> 01:46:03,160
They knew it already. But I can tell
you that they did not know everything.

1714
01:46:04,238 --> 01:46:07,537
They did not know everything
on that hot summer day

1715
01:46:07,608 --> 01:46:11,237
that I showed up in their parking
lot with my partner, Gil Previck,

1716
01:46:11,512 --> 01:46:15,175
and an early version of what I
called the Kearns Blinking Eye Motor.

1717
01:46:17,184 --> 01:46:19,880
And now, with all these great
impressive lawyers over here,

1718
01:46:19,953 --> 01:46:23,286
they're trying to tell you
that my patents were expired.

1719
01:46:23,357 --> 01:46:25,825
That the patent office
made a mistake,

1720
01:46:25,893 --> 01:46:30,296
not one time, not two times,
but five times

1721
01:46:30,364 --> 01:46:32,298
when they issued
me my patents.

1722
01:46:33,133 --> 01:46:35,158
And now they're trying
to make you believe

1723
01:46:35,235 --> 01:46:37,795
that they're worthless,
that they're nothing.

1724
01:46:38,138 --> 01:46:41,574
<i>That my life's work
is nothing.</i>

1725
01:46:41,642 --> 01:46:45,100
They want you to believe that,
because that is what they believe.

1726
01:46:52,753 --> 01:46:55,654
Well, I want you, uh...

1727
01:47:00,961 --> 01:47:03,794
I want you to know something.

1728
01:47:04,031 --> 01:47:05,692
When I walked into
this courtroom,

1729
01:47:05,766 --> 01:47:08,462
I was wearing a
badge right here.

1730
01:47:08,569 --> 01:47:12,505
<i>You couldn't see it.
It said I was an inventor.</i>

1731
01:47:13,240 --> 01:47:14,969
A contributor to society.

1732
01:47:16,877 --> 01:47:19,675
<i>And I know that you couldn't
see this when I walked in here.</i>

1733
01:47:19,747 --> 01:47:22,682
And right now there are
people still in this courtroom

1734
01:47:22,750 --> 01:47:24,012
<i>who can't see that badge.</i>

1735
01:47:24,084 --> 01:47:28,384
<i>Mr. Finley, well,
he can't see that badge.</i>

1736
01:47:28,956 --> 01:47:31,151
None of the men
at that table can.

1737
01:47:32,092 --> 01:47:35,550
<i>But I'd like to believe that
after everything that you've heard,</i>

1738
01:47:37,097 --> 01:47:40,726
and everything that you've listened
to for these past few weeks,

1739
01:47:40,801 --> 01:47:43,326
that you can see it,
you can see this badge.

1740
01:47:47,474 --> 01:47:49,237
<i>That's what I hope.</i>

1741
01:47:56,717 --> 01:47:58,344
I can see you're tired.

1742
01:47:59,286 --> 01:48:01,811
<i>And I'm tired, too.</i>

1743
01:48:01,922 --> 01:48:04,117
<i>So I'm not gonna sit up
here and try and interpret</i>

1744
01:48:04,191 --> 01:48:06,989
everything you've heard
for these past few weeks.

1745
01:48:07,127 --> 01:48:09,425
<i>I'm just gonna ask you
to use your memory</i>

1746
01:48:09,496 --> 01:48:10,986
and your good sense

1747
01:48:14,201 --> 01:48:15,725
to do the right thing.

1748
01:48:15,803 --> 01:48:17,896
<i>That's all I could
ask of anybody.</i>

1749
01:48:22,476 --> 01:48:26,344
Yeah. Thank you.
Thank you.

1750
01:48:29,750 --> 01:48:33,277
Thank you, Dr. Kearns.
Thank you, Mr. Finley.

1751
01:49:04,885 --> 01:49:06,978
Has the jury
reached a verdict?

1752
01:49:07,221 --> 01:49:08,711
We have, Your Honor.

1753
01:49:09,423 --> 01:49:11,323
Would you please read it?

1754
01:49:11,792 --> 01:49:14,659
<i>In the Robert Kearns vs.
The Ford Motor Company,</i>

1755
01:49:14,728 --> 01:49:18,095
we find that the Ford Motor
Company did infringe on...

1756
01:49:25,038 --> 01:49:28,201
...did infringe on patents
held by Robert Kearns.

1757
01:49:28,275 --> 01:49:31,767
In consideration of these
non-willful infringements,

1758
01:49:31,879 --> 01:49:36,043
we award the plaintiff
$10,100,000.

1759
01:49:48,462 --> 01:49:51,863
<i>I can't believe we won.
We really did it.</i>

1760
01:49:51,932 --> 01:49:54,526
<i>That's amazing!
We won, Daddy.</i>

1761
01:49:54,768 --> 01:49:57,202
Bob. Congratulations.

1762
01:49:57,271 --> 01:49:59,603
<i>Hell, you earned it.
I'm really happy for you.</i>

1763
01:49:59,673 --> 01:50:01,368
Thank you, Gil.

1764
01:50:16,623 --> 01:50:19,854
Phyllis? Phyllis!

1765
01:50:27,901 --> 01:50:29,664
Congratulations, Robert.

1766
01:50:31,471 --> 01:50:35,339
You finally got everything
you wanted. And you deserve it.

1767
01:50:36,777 --> 01:50:39,940
Well, not everything.

1768
01:50:40,013 --> 01:50:41,810
<i>I don't get the last
12 years back.</i>

1769
01:50:43,083 --> 01:50:45,210
I suppose not.

1770
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:47,787
<i>But it's over.</i>

1771
01:50:48,055 --> 01:50:51,684
<i>I don't
think so. No.</i>

1772
01:50:52,459 --> 01:50:55,519
It'll never be over. There'll
always be another battle.

1773
01:50:55,595 --> 01:50:57,290
<i>That's just you.</i>

1774
01:50:58,899 --> 01:51:00,127
Yeah,

1775
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:01,827
I've been thinking
about that.

1776
01:51:02,903 --> 01:51:04,803
<i>I don't know if I can
go through this again.</i>

1777
01:51:04,871 --> 01:51:07,066
Dr. Kearns?
Dr. Kearns!

1778
01:51:08,175 --> 01:51:09,437
Oh.
Wow!

1779
01:51:10,310 --> 01:51:11,709
Louis...
Wow!

1780
01:51:11,812 --> 01:51:12,972
We just wanted to
congratulate you.

1781
01:51:13,046 --> 01:51:14,138
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

1782
01:51:14,214 --> 01:51:16,705
A bunch of us, we got
together and we got you this.

1783
01:51:16,783 --> 01:51:18,045
Oh...

1784
01:51:20,053 --> 01:51:21,611
<i>You were just excellent in
there. I mean, I don't think</i>

1785
01:51:21,688 --> 01:51:23,679
they know what hit them back there.
We were just talking about it.

1786
01:51:23,757 --> 01:51:25,691
Like, we were talking about
it as the whole thing happened.

1787
01:51:25,759 --> 01:51:28,626
That was something else.
Thank you. Thank you.

1788
01:51:28,695 --> 01:51:30,492
<i>It's just great.
Wow!</i>

1789
01:51:38,238 --> 01:51:40,297
There was like,
19 reporters there.

1790
01:51:40,374 --> 01:51:41,841
Yeah, I saw
a guy from CNN.

1791
01:51:41,908 --> 01:51:43,375
There were some other
television studios, too.

1792
01:51:43,443 --> 01:51:45,411
<i>Well, that's what I meant.</i>

1793
01:51:45,479 --> 01:51:46,605
I had chocolate.

1794
01:51:46,680 --> 01:51:47,942
Oh, thanks.
I had strawberry.

1795
01:51:48,015 --> 01:51:49,744
I know, you guys, I know. We know.

1796
01:51:49,816 --> 01:51:51,613
Might I be able to get
a hamburger, too?

1797
01:51:51,852 --> 01:51:53,319
I think we can work
on that for you, sure.

1798
01:51:53,387 --> 01:51:54,615
Thanks.

1799
01:51:54,688 --> 01:51:57,851
<i>So, uh, anyone see Kathy kiss up to
that guy from the Washington Post?</i>

1800
01:51:57,924 --> 01:51:58,948
Oh, yeah.

1801
01:51:59,026 --> 01:52:01,790
<i>He wasn't from there. He
was from Channel 7, actually.</i>

1802
01:52:01,862 --> 01:52:04,353
Exactly. Did you get your
face up in there, big enough?

1803
01:52:04,431 --> 01:52:06,126
<i>No, I don't
think I did actually.</i>

1804
01:52:06,199 --> 01:52:07,598
<i>Uh, I don't
have a spoon.</i>

1805
01:52:07,667 --> 01:52:09,157
Well, you could have
mine but I just used it.

1806
01:52:10,504 --> 01:52:11,835
There was a guy
from England, too.

1807
01:52:11,905 --> 01:52:13,566
<i>Uh, The London Times, actually.</i>
