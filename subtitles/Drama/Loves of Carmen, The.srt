1
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,320
When a man loves a woman

2
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,920
Can't keep his mind
on nothin' else

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,280
He'll trade the world for
the good thing he's found

4
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,360
If she is bad he can't see it

5
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,080
She can do no wrong

6
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,280
Turn his back
on his best friend

7
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,360
If he put her down

8
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,760
When a man loves a woman

9
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,480
Spend his very last dime

10
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:55,520
Tryin' to hold on
to what he needs

11
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,680
He'll give up all his comforts

12
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,560
And sleep out in the rain

13
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,200
- If she said that's the way it ought to be
- Hey, that looks good.

14
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,040
That sandwich. Looks good.
You on your lunch hour?

15
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:17,280
When a man loves a woman

16
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,920
- Any news in the paper?
- Would you like to read a section of this?

17
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,160
No, thanks. I, uh,
actually read for a living.

18
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,920
- So, the last thing I want to be doing
on my lunch hour... - Oh, excuse me. - Hey!

19
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,920
- Sorry. Excuse me, miss.
- Yeah.

20
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,880
Baby, please don't treat me bad

21
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,000
- Okay?
- Yeah.

22
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,120
When a man loves a woman

23
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,680
- What?
- Where you going after this?

24
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,960
- Why would you be asking that?
- Ah, I am a pilot.

25
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,600
And I'm gonna barely make
my flight to Seattle-Tacoma...

26
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,120
and I haven't had a chance
to pick up my laundry.

27
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,640
- And?
- I thought you could pick it up for me.

28
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,840
Oh, I'd give you the money
and everything.

29
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,640
Here's the receipt and $30.
That should cover it.

30
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,720
What do you propose that I do with
your laundry after I pick it up?

31
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,640
Good question.

32
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,240
Here's the keys to my place.

33
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,560
The address is on the,
uh, little thing.

34
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,880
And I will be there
at about 12:30 and...

35
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,800
- you can bring it by then.
- After midnight?

36
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,760
- Uh, excuse me., Actually, sir, I was...
- No, no, hold on one second, one second, one second.

37
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,320
- If I could impose one further question.
- Okay.

38
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,240
Why wouldn't I drop off your
laundry at my convenience...

39
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,160
since I have your key?

40
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,360
Because then I wouldn't be able
to thank you properly.

41
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,280
Oh, I see.
And how would you do that?

42
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,640
I would give you something...

43
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,480
that you can take away with you.

44
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,880
- And what might that be?
- Oh, you want to know up front?

45
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,560
Oh, yeah.

46
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,200
Excuse me.

47
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,040
I bake.

48
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,560
You bake?

49
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,840
You bake!

50
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,480
You like... chocolate.

51
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,360
I'm allergic... to chocolate.

52
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,720
Do you like carrot cake?

53
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,640
Very much.

54
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,440
Well, then?

55
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,840
Cream cheese frosting?

56
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,720
My specialty.

57
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,600
- Check it out.
- Look.

58
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,360
She's so lucky.

59
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,520
- Jesus!
- Whoa.

60
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,560
Cable guy come this morning?

61
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,320
No? That's three weeks those kids
are without adult movies.

62
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,240
What a fuckin' world.

63
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,000
Hey, that looks good.

64
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,920
Is that Chablis?

65
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,080
Does anyone have, like,
a towel or something?

66
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,520
Now, this is you, inside.

67
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,320
Not inside the dress,
inside the body.

68
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,840
- How did I get in there?
- That's a whole other set of videos.

69
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,520
And they won't
let you watch those.

70
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,000
- Give me this.
- There you are.

71
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,240
Why wasn't your
real daddy there?

72
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,720
- You say the dumbest things.
- I'm four years old.

73
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,240
- Guys!
- Mom, can you tell her?

74
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,560
Oh! I married your daddy...

75
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,240
because he made me a cake
with cream cheese frosting.

76
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,160
That's how much he wanted me.

77
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,320
How come Daddy wanted you?

78
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,160
God, woman, just look at her.

79
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,320
Oop, late!
Second team, take over.

80
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:35,400
Porsche. Jesus, one more time.
Amy?

81
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,800
Jess has to do her homework tonight so
she doesn't leave it for the weekend.

82
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,400
Let's go. Amy, did you get that?

83
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,640
Which part were you
afraid I missed?

84
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,680
- Amy?
- Sorry.

85
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,600
Happy anniversary.

86
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,920
It's a press-on tattoo!

87
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,240
It says, "If found naked,
please return to Alice Green. "

88
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,960
It's to wear on trips so that the
stewardesses know you're spoken for.

89
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,720
- Flight attendants.
- Flight attendants, whatever.

90
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,720
Very thoughtful.

91
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,320
- I went over the 20 bucks.
- Oh, hey, I didn't go over the 20 bucks.

92
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,920
- Really?
- Yeah.

93
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,600
You rat.

94
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,880
That's incredible.

95
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,640
Now I'm gonna have to do
that thing to you tonight.

96
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,360
I think she wants you, baby.

97
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,760
- Hello, how're you doing?
- Fine.

98
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,280
- Mm, you're a good dancer.
- Thank you.

99
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,320
Ooh! Thanks.

100
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,600
- How was he?
- He was great!

101
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,560
Happy anniversary.

102
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,000
- Oh!
- What?

103
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,160
- Porsche again.
- Oh, honey.

104
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,480
Come here. No, no, no. Alice?

105
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,360
- Honey.
- Goddamn it.

106
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,120
Hey, it's 1:00 in the morning.
People are trying to have sex up here!

107
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,640
Alice, there's nobody down there.
You're talking to a car.

108
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,560
Goddamn it!

109
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,720
Alice.

110
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,440
- Alice.
- What a piece of shit. Damn it.

111
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,160
- Alice.
- Goddamn it. Shut up!

112
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,880
- Alice! Alice!
- Goddamn it!

113
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,040
- Alice, am I gonna like this?
- Here.

114
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,600
Shut up!

115
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,800
Shit!

116
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,120
Fucking foreign car!

117
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,320
Okay, batter up!

118
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,920
Right here! Hey, batter, batter,
batter, batter, batter, batter!

119
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,280
Right here. Come on,
baby. Let's go.

120
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,160
I'll start your shower.

121
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,160
You're not suggesting
I go to work?

122
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,080
Yes.

123
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,280
Okay. You promise
no one will be loud?

124
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,640
Six hundred kids? Sure.

125
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,800
Go on.

126
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,360
Get dressed, sugar.
We're runnin' late.

127
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,920
See, I'm not sure that
Matthew Wasserman's...

128
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,760
glance at your breasts rises to
the level of sexual harassment.

129
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,160
Well, what if he said,
"You know you want it. "

130
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,400
- Did he?
- No.

131
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,320
- But what if he did?
- Well, that would be closer.

132
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,600
I think if we can get him to lift up
your dress, we can put him away.

133
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,560
So, uh...

134
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,040
what is the deal with cutting
language lab... Shit!

135
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,200
Another self-mutilation day.

136
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,040
I'm checking on availability
for end-of-the-day wind-down.

137
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,080
Oh, come on. My problem's gotta
be more sordid than Shannon's.

138
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,680
Okay, a quick one.
Michael's got a trip.

139
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,480
Yes.

140
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:28,040
- Hi. - Hey. -
Where's Alice?

141
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,200
That's right, where's Alice?
Bye.

142
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,560
Amy! Amy! Amy, Amy, Amy, Amy,
Amy, Amy.

143
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,720
Listen, I, uh, got a trip.

144
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,360
I'm late, and Wayne's supposed to
meet me. I've got no way to call him.

145
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,040
He's waiting at my Lamaze class.
I just can't not show up. I...

146
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,280
Amy, Amy, uh, this is important.
I got a trip.

147
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,920
You're not saying my life
is less important?

148
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,960
Of course not.

149
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,760
I didn't think so. Bye.

150
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,840
She didn't come home.

151
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,440
I did notice that.

152
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,960
- I have a trip.
- What if she doesn't get back?

153
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,000
Well, I'll just go down to the corner
and offer the first person I see...

154
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,480
- five bucks to stay with you.
- Michael.

155
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,480
Okay, ten bucks.

156
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,920
You're so pretty.

157
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,840
Twenty minutes, lights out.

158
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,760
- Okay?
- Okay.

159
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,080
You're okay.

160
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,760
I've called everyone we know.

161
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,320
Hospitals, the school.

162
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,160
- You're up.
- I'm supposed to be up.

163
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,200
I'm just supposed to be
doing it in Chicago.

164
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,320
Hey! Stop that.

165
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,120
You got a trip.

166
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,160
Really?

167
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,880
I better get a move on.

168
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,800
I forgot that. I'm sorry.
I owe you a trip.

169
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,720
What happened?

170
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,440
- We went for a drink.
- Pam? - Yeah, Pam.

171
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,720
My friend. She needed me.
She needed to talk.

172
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,520
She needed me 'cause
Joe is an asshole.

173
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,720
I'm glad she needed you 'cause
she's the one who got you.

174
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,680
- Nobody else got a fucking phone call.
- We were just talking.

175
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,120
She was crying and, and, uh...

176
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,680
Ah, when I looked at the time,
I just figured you were asleep.

177
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,360
So, uh...

178
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,160
I- I-I don't know how
I forgot the trip.

179
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,520
I don't know either.

180
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:34,200
Christ, Michael.

181
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,640
You don't know what I go through.
You don't have a fucking clue.

182
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,760
- What do you go through?
- My job, for one.

183
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,560
The girls and,
and running this place...

184
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,960
and I know a lot of women
go through the same thing...

185
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,040
but their husbands
aren't gone half the time.

186
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,920
I miss you...

187
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:00,120
when you go.

188
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,680
You got pressures,
you come to me.

189
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,320
Why do that to you? What are you
supposed to do with all that?

190
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,880
You let me worry about that.

191
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,480
I'm gonna trade Ed Buckley for a trip to
Mexico for a week and we're gonna disappear.

192
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,400
Would you like that?

193
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,800
Would you like to disappear?

194
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,600
Go get some candy from Grandpa.

195
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,840
And Mama Andretti.

196
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,520
Hello, Casey, Casey!
How are you?

197
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,600
Look what I got for you. See?

198
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:56,480
- I'm not staying with her.
- Hey, it's gonna be okay, honey.

199
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,080
Yeah, but she doesn't
care about us.

200
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,600
Listen, she's crazy about you,
and she's gonna spoil you rotten.

201
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,640
- Hi, Mom. How are you? Thanks for coming.
- Hello, Michael, dear.

202
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,000
- She still puts you down, and I don't like it.
- Hey.

203
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,000
You're gonna have to cut Grandma a little
bit of slack. She hasn't had the easiest life.

204
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,800
Jessica.

205
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:18,920
- How's my sweet angel?
- Oh, just fine, Mom.

206
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,400
- How are you?
- Have you lost weight?

207
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,360
- No. No.
- I guess you're just tired.

208
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,560
- Hello, Jessie.
- I wish I had time to be tired.

209
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,840
- Give me a smile. Come on. Give me a big smile!
- Walter!

210
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,320
- Don't let Michael carry all those bags in by himself!
- I'm sorry.

211
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,000
It's all right, Ma.
It's only two bags.

212
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,200
Give him the small one.
He likes to feel useful.

213
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,800
I got it, I got it.

214
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,400
Mom, can I get you anything before we
fly off and leave you with the kids?

215
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,200
The best thing you can do for me is just
have the grandest time in the world...

216
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,600
and come home rested, please?

217
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,720
- Hello. - Hey,
Dad! - You know what?

218
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,480
When Mama comes home, we're gonna
have a big surprise for her.

219
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,040
We're gonna have
the whole house clean.

220
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,600
Won't that be nice, huh?

221
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,760
- Thanks, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, girl.
- Bye.

222
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,680
- Thanks. Bye. Thanks.
- Bye. Have fun.

223
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,680
Safe trip.

224
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,720
- Bye, Mom. I love you! -
Bye, bye. - Love you! Bye!

225
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,640
- Okay, let's go.
- Don't clean too hard.

226
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,800
It's a press-on tattoo.

227
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,160
Just in case. You never know
what might happen in Mexico.

228
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,360
Found a guy at the beach
who'll watch us have sex.

229
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,440
Ooh.

230
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,360
- A local?
- Mm-hmm.

231
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,840
- Come on, honey.
- Ooh. Okay.

232
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,600
Come on.

233
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,560
Baby, gotta tell you something.

234
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,480
Listen.

235
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,280
I think we should do this
more often.

236
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,440
I do... because...

237
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,040
they paid you to fly here,
I got a pass...

238
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,960
the hotel
is a remarkable discount.

239
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,360
There are meals, as you've
said before, Johnny.

240
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,640
You gotta eat anyway,
so we can afford this.

241
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,240
- Not unless they comp the drinks.
- Ah.

242
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,880
What's that supposed
to mean, hmm?

243
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,960
- Hey. - You lookin' for a
fight, buster? - No, I'm not.

244
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,120
- Buster, buster. Wait, wait, wait. I got a bruise here.
- Sit down, Alice. Alice, please.

245
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,240
- Hey! Alice!
- If you wanna fight, I can give you...

246
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,000
- all the trouble you can handle.
- Sit down. Okay, great. I know you can.

247
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,600
Alice, sit down. Sit!

248
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,800
- Sit.
- Woof.

249
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,720
Alice! Alice!

250
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,040
I'm waiting for my spanking.

251
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,200
I know we have pressures.

252
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,600
And we need to have fun.

253
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:15,240
But wringing you out at the end of an
evening is less fun than it used to be.

254
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,280
And thinking back, it's been going on
for quite a while, Alice.

255
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,480
What's wrong, baby?

256
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,720
Can you talk about it?

257
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,240
You scared me last night.

258
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,240
Didn't you scare you?

259
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,760
Huh? What's gonna happen?

260
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,680
I'm gonna stop drinking
so much.

261
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,200
Last night was the best thing that
could've happened to straighten my ass out.

262
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,160
I promise you.

263
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,440
I promise me.

264
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,360
- Hey!
- Jessie! Ow!

265
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,800
- Pinatas!
- They're here!

266
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,400
- Oh, honey, don't get dirty.
- Casey!

267
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,040
- Hi... Hey!
- Someone's getting married.

268
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,440
Hi, pretty girl.

269
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,160
- Hi, Casey, honey.
- You look wonderful.

270
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,720
- Hey.
- Oh, my God, I hope those pinatas aren't full of candy.

271
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,960
- Let me take this for you, darling.
- Hi. Hi, Daddy.

272
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,320
- Hi. Wow, man. - Good to see
ya. - Hey, Pops, how are you?

273
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,800
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, honey.

274
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,640
- I smell Murphy's Oil.
- Yes, I used it a lot.

275
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,760
Shit!

276
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,640
Well, everything's fine
on the curb.

277
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,840
Garbage compulsion.
I feel much better now.

278
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,240
Come on, baby, it's late.

279
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,360
Casey.

280
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,160
You're not going to Dana's.

281
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:10,560
Case, I think we're gonna have to fill out
one of these homicide reports for Felicia.

282
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,240
- She's soaking off her make-up.
- Oh.

283
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,600
- Did I miss something?
- She didn't do her book report, so she can't go to Dana's.

284
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:34,240
- It's not due till Monday.
- I told you last night not to save it for the weekend...

285
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,280
- to make sure that you did it on...
- Good morning. Good morning.

286
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,680
Good morning. Good morning,
the first words out of our mouths.

287
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,840
I think we have all we can handle right
now with our coffee and our little spoon.

288
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:58,440
So, you go to Dana's, and the report
gets done first thing Saturday...

289
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,960
- and not last thing Sunday, okay?
- What's the difference?

290
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,960
The difference between me
helping you do it...

291
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,480
and me pulling your lungs out
through your belly button.

292
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,400
- Sorry I'm late.
- That's okay.

293
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,320
Um, Casey's taking a nap...

294
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,760
and Jess is teaching Samantha
how to use a computer.

295
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,920
- You all right?
- I... Whoa.

296
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,880
I had lunch at this Thai place,
and, uh...

297
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,960
something in the oil,
maybe, but...

298
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,920
I'll be fine. See you tomorrow.

299
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,720
Uh, Alice, um, I can call my mom. I'm
sure I can stay and make some supper.

300
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,480
I said, see you tomorrow.

301
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,920
- Alice, I think you should...
- Ah, ah, Amy.

302
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,600
Go home.

303
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,400
Okay?

304
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,640
Please!

305
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,840
Go home.

306
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,000
You get some rest.

307
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,120
And I'll call you
a little later.

308
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:58,320
Mom, look. Samantha drew
a Buick on the computer.

309
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,520
- It's green.
- Do your homework.

310
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,080
Mom?

311
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,600
Mom?

312
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,800
- Mom, are you sick?
- I said...

313
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,720
do your homework!

314
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,040
Mom, are you sick?

315
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,360
I did my homework!
That's all I wanted to tell you!

316
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,480
Good girl.

317
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,280
Jess!

318
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,480
Mom?

319
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,760
Mom?

320
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,760
Is there a Michael Green?
Michael Green?

321
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,040
- Switchboard tracking you down, I guess.
- Thank you.

322
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,280
Hello.

323
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,720
Jess, what's the matter, honey?

324
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,560
- Mommy died.
- What?

325
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,160
She just fell through
the shower door and...

326
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,800
all the glass is all shattered
and on the floor...

327
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,240
and she's laying
in the middle of it.

328
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,920
Jess, listen to me. I'm gonna have
somebody over there right away.

329
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,560
- You understand?
- Okay.

330
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,400
- Okay? And I'm gonna call you right back.
- Okay.

331
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,400
I need an outside line.

332
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:25,880
- I need an outside line!
- Sir.

333
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,440
Hi.

334
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,920
You're all right.

335
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,840
Doctor says.

336
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,080
How's Jess?

337
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,200
She's really happy you're okay.

338
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,280
I hit her hard, Michael.

339
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,240
- I hit her so hard.
- It's all right.

340
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,160
She's fine.

341
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,360
We're gonna get you better
so it doesn't happen again.

342
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,280
All right?

343
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,920
- God, just don't hate me.
- Mmm.

344
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,200
Because I'll die if you do.

345
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,080
That thought would
never enter my mind.

346
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,160
I start at 4:00 in the morning,
and it goes all day.

347
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,280
I drink in the john, I drink...

348
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:08,240
in the closet, and I drink in
the kids' room when they're not there.

349
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,880
You know how when we...
go out to the car...

350
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,480
- and I have to go back
inside for a second? - Mm-hmm.

351
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,400
I have to be high
to do anything.

352
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,200
And I'm scared all the time.

353
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:34,640
- I drank for Casey's goddam birthday party.
- So did I.

354
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,760
I drink a quart a day.

355
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,120
It's vodka, so you
couldn't smell it.

356
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,760
How come I didn't see this?

357
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,680
Because I hid it.

358
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,000
You were scared.

359
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,000
- What am I gonna do?
- We'll figure it out.

360
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,840
I don't want you
to worry about it.

361
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,320
I'm gonna find you
the best treatment...

362
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,200
the best in the fucking world.

363
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,960
You're not alone, honey. Never.

364
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,560
Never.

365
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:52,640
- Okay, girls, I'll see you later.
- Bye.

366
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,800
- Mommy. - Amy. - Oh, I'll
just wait in the kitchen.

367
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,160
Okay.

368
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,040
So...

369
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,360
we'll talk on the phone
and you'll come see me.

370
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,680
- And then I'll be home.
- And we'll go to the beach?

371
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:23,960
- Are you gonna take care of your sister?
- I'm gonna take care of Daddy.

372
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,600
Sorry, baby.

373
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,080
It will never happen again.

374
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,520
Mommy loves you.

375
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,760
- That's us.
- Hi.

376
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,440
Uh, we're Alice Green.

377
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,640
Hi. Welcome.

378
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,520
Alice, before we check you in,
I need to look through your bag.

379
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,000
Is that all right with you?
It's strictly routine.

380
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,920
We've got all your
paperwork, so...

381
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:49,520
everything's ready.
Um, sorry.

382
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,080
So, come on, Alice,
and we'll get you checked in.

383
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,040
Just Alice.

384
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,920
Give me a minute.

385
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,520
I'll call you tonight.

386
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,360
- I'm sorry. There's no phone calls.
- Excuse me, uh...

387
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,000
She's my wife. She can call me
whenever she needs to call me.

388
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,360
She'll be in detox
until Tuesday...

389
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,400
and she'll be busy getting well.

390
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,040
She'll call you as soon
as she can after that.

391
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,920
I love you.

392
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,440
I love you.

393
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,400
I can hear her heart beat

394
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:13,040
From a thousand miles

395
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,520
Yeah, the heavens open

396
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,680
Every time she smiles

397
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,320
And when I come to her

398
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,960
That's where I belong

399
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:31,120
And I'm runnin' to her

400
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,800
Like a love song

401
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:38,000
She gimme love, love, love, love

402
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,760
Crazy love

403
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,880
She gimme love, love, love, love

404
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,800
Crazy love

405
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:52,080
She gimme love, love, love, love

406
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,280
Crazy love

407
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,040
Jess?

408
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,680
It's 6:00 in the morning.

409
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,640
Kids are unbelievable.

410
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,000
First she wants French toast,
then she wants tuna.

411
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,240
And then she wants
a cucumber sandwich.

412
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,760
Case!

413
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,920
Wanna know what
she finally eats?

414
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,520
- She ate fruit.
- She ate fruit.

415
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,680
Right.

416
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,560
My hair hurts.

417
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,920
Casey, is that you?

418
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,280
- Oh! God.
- I did her hair.

419
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:35,360
Oh, I like it.
Let's see that hairdo.

420
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:39,080
Ooh, that's a little tight there.
Let me see that.

421
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,840
- Ow!
- Ooh, sorry!

422
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:44,360
- Mommy does it better.
- Oh, Mommy does everything better.

423
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:47,840
She cooks better, she looks better,
she kisses better.

424
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:50,480
Mommy's a better person.

425
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,520
You know, I bet you have
a lot of questions...

426
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,000
things you're feeling
about Mommy.

427
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,920
We could talk about that.

428
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,960
See, like if you're sad or
scared or angry or something...

429
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,360
- you could just...
- What's a alcoholic?

430
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:13,840
Someone with a bad habit, you know, like
if you drank stuff that made you sick.

431
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,760
But you really liked it, so you kept
drinking it and it kept making you sick.

432
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,480
Wouldn't you want
to learn how to stop?

433
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,200
- What's a alcoholic?
- It's why she does all that stuff.

434
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:32,080
When she does all that stuff,
like when she talks like she's sleepy...

435
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:36,520
forgets stuff,
and when she's sad.

436
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,440
When she cries?

437
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:43,080
She cries in the bathroom.

438
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,720
She, she did that a lot,
I bet, huh?

439
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,240
Your hair is so pretty.

440
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:13,520
You know, Mommy can't wait
to get back just to brush it?

441
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,000
I got it. Alice?

442
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:31,120
I'm Dr Mendez.
I'm a counsellor.

443
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,600
You know you're supposed
to be in community now?

444
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,040
Your nurse said you've
got a problem?

445
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,160
No problem.
I don't have any problems.

446
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,080
- You think I have a problem?
- Yeah, at least.

447
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:47,040
I just want to make a phone call. I just
want to make a phone call to my husband.

448
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:50,040
If you wanted to make a phone call to your
husband, would you call that a problem?

449
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,680
 No, but I'm not in detox
 dealing with an addiction.

450
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:56,200
- Look, we'll let you make a phone call, as soon as...
- Now!

451
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:59,680
- Now is when I want to call him! Now! Can you understand that?
- Alice...

452
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:04,120
- Alice, look...
- Can you understand fucking anything?

453
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,040
Yeah.

454
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,960
I can.

455
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,520
Two more days, hon.
You can do this.

456
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,640
Hang in.

457
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,640
Come on.

458
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,960
Hello.

459
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,560
- Michael.
- Alice?

460
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,680
- Alice?
- Yeah.

461
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,600
You can call.

462
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,760
Yeah. What do you know?
They let me use the phone.

463
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,160
How was detox?

464
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,840
It was nifty, you know.

465
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:20,520
- I threw up like a good girl.
- Great.

466
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,880
Hard part's over, baby.

467
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:30,400
Yeah, the hard part's over.
Party time.

468
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,800
Well, so, uh...

469
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,960
basically, I just, uh,
sit around and...

470
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,880
think of you naked because,
you know, you have this...

471
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,800
amazing body.

472
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,640
You still do, don't you?

473
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,200
State of the art.

474
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,600
So, you'd be, what,
65 pounds now?

475
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,600
Honey.

476
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,520
Alice.

477
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,520
Honey, you there?

478
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,800
Alice.

479
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:24,080
Yeah.

480
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,440
Everyone here is
pulling for you.

481
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,840
Alice, they say they tear
you down the first two weeks...

482
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,120
so they can build you back up.

483
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,600
- Alice.
- God, I'm sorry, baby.

484
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,880
It's just so hard.

485
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:58,160
- Honey, are you there?
- Yeah.

486
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,080
I'm here, baby.

487
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,440
I love you.

488
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,480
I miss you.

489
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,920
Listen, I'll see you, um,
I'll see you on Sunday.

490
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,120
- Okay?
- The kids are so excited to see you.

491
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,400
I can't talk for too long
because there's, um...

492
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,800
one phone and a whole line
of people, so...

493
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:27,120
Can you bring
my grey sweatsuit?

494
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,040
Yes.

495
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,200
I'm just, uh, running down
my list...

496
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,600
of dumb things to say
right now.

497
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,320
Good for you.

498
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,080
You're supposed to wrap it.

499
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:02,360
- What?
- In a newspaper or a paper bag.

500
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,760
So nobody sees it or something.

501
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,040
Mommy tell you that?

502
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,600
Hey.

503
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:45,680
You wanna do one?

504
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,360
Come on. Take your pick.

505
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,440
Vodka, huh?

506
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,520
All right.

507
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,880
Let me see.

508
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,600
Now if Mommy cries
when she sees you...

509
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,800
it's because
you're beautiful.

510
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,840
Okay?

511
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,760
Piggyback?

512
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:05,280
Oh, the purse. Ready?

513
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,040
- Where is she?
- I don't know. We'll see.

514
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,120
She said she'd be out here.

515
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,600
There she is.
Do you see her in the hat?

516
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:26,080
Mommy! Mommy!

517
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,720
Mommy.

518
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,480
Mommy.

519
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,840
Hi, baby.

520
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,760
Hey.

521
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:50,880
Say hi to Mommy.

522
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:56,360
- Hi, beautiful girl. Hi.
- Hi.

523
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,560
You want to take 'em for a walk
and I'll catch up later?

524
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,760
- Hmm? Bye-bye.
- Thank you.

525
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:08,640
- Okay.
- Come on, you guys. Let's go.

526
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,920
Art Braun left alone.

527
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,880
- Nice shot.
- Excuse me. Can you get some coffee in here?

528
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,720
What do I look like,
a fuckin' waitress?

529
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:25,520
Try the striped in the side.

530
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,600
Hey! I saw you with Alice.

531
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,600
You're her significant other.

532
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,880
Good to meet you, man.
Your wife's amazing. Malcolm.

533
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,080
- Oh, uh, Michael.
- Yeah, Michael.

534
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,840
- Good to know... Come on in.
- How are ya? No, I got the kids outside.

535
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,760
- Uh-uh. That's okay. This is Earl.
- Hey, I'm Earl.

536
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,680
- Hi, Earl. Michael.
- Hiya. Watch the game.

537
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,760
- No, I-I got the kids outside. Okay.
- Have a seat, man.

538
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:48,880
- Myers shooting at 50% tonight.
- Well, there's that middleman.

539
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,040
- Blalock is still on him. - Hi.
How ya doin'? - Good. How are ya?

540
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,400
...moved up the lane,
opened up that soft spot.

541
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,720
It's clear
on the other side there...

542
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:06,320
- Come on, Malcolm.
- Been a while since you watched a game without a beer?

543
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:09,000
- Me?
- You.

544
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:12,400
Actually, uh, I don... I don...
I don't, uh, drink much.

545
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,200
Can you believe that, man?

546
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:23,280
I been there, man. Denial.

547
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,720
- Jesus.
- Ain't just a river in Egypt.

548
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,160
- Hey, shut up!
- Cork it, Danny.

549
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:31,000
Are you guys sayin' that
this dude don't drink?

550
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:35,760
- I'm sayin' shut the fuck up, man!
- Fellas. Fellas, my fault.

551
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:39,040
Hey. It's a cunning,
baffling disease, man.

552
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,120
The man doesn't have a problem,
pecker-face. You do!

553
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,400
Cunning and baffling disease.

554
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,560
- Save it for group, man. Save it for group.
- Yeah!

555
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:50,600
- Nah, not in group, Earl.
- Save it for group, all right? Yo, Earl, man.

556
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:53,440
- I like your new friends.
- Oh, d'you meet Malcolm?

557
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,880
- Big black guy.
- Cokehead.

558
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,840
- We hit it off.
- The girls are with him.

559
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:03,440
Right now?

560
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:07,320
Oh, come on, Michael.
He's not a child molester.

561
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,240
He's an armed robber.

562
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:21,920
What?

563
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:27,640
Well.

564
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:31,280
Whatever you think of these people,
Michael, think that of me, because it fits.

565
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:40,000
- I thought you'd quit.
- I did.

566
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,280
Malcolm and I, um...

567
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:48,680
really talk, you know?

568
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:51,080
Talk about everything.

569
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:54,280
Everything.

570
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:58,120
We have a lot in common, and the
truth is that right... right now...

571
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:00,520
I really need these people.

572
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:05,160
I'm glad you have 'em.

573
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,800
And when you come home,
you'll have me.

574
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:16,800
What's wrong, Alice?

575
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,200
Hmm? You were fine when the kids
were around. What's wrong?

576
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,400
Long day.

577
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,840
- Hey.
- Hi.

578
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,320
Gary, this is Michael.

579
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,080
Hi.

580
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,080
- Feel like I know you.
- Oh, yeah?

581
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:42,960
Yeah. Your wife's
a very comforting person.

582
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,720
- Yes.
- Very.

583
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:48,680
Do you mind if I talk
to her for a second?

584
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:51,240
- No.
- I just need... Just for a second.

585
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,360
- I'll just be one second. What's the matter?
- Okay.

586
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,560
Uh...

587
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:57,840
I'm sorry.

588
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:12,440
Sheila... called me.

589
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,040
Bob. Bobby!

590
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:59,320
No, that's not what I said. I have never
turned the company down in an emergency before.

591
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,640
- This is a first. Bob! Bob, I...
- Give me it! Give me it!

592
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:06,720
I am not gonna leave my kids for four days with
Alice gone! I mean, ah, well, I'm certainly...

593
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,640
not gonna bring Alice's mother into the
picture at this point in their lives.

594
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,840
- They have enough grief already. Amy!
- Give me it! Give me it!

595
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,240
- What?
- Come on! Give me it!

596
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:17,440
Roll-backs?
Will you settle down? Amy!

597
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:20,760
- Amy! Amy! Hello?
- No!

598
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,800
What do roll-backs have
to do with this, Bob?

599
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,040
Oh, Bobby. Why don't you just
save the little subtle threats.

600
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:30,480
It's making me embarrassed
for you. Amy! Listen, hold...

601
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,520
Can you hold on a second?
Hold on.

602
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:41,240
Hey! Hey! What is this? What is this?
Huh? Get up! Get up right now!

603
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,760
- She bit me. She bit me hard.
- Did you bite her?

604
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,680
- Yeah.
- Well, that's no excuse!

605
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:48,960
This is your baby sister, and you could
hurt her. Huh? You're much bigger than her.

606
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:51,240
You should be loving each other,
you understand me?

607
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,760
- Now who spilled this Coke?
- She did it. - She did it.

608
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,080
- Who? - She did
it! - She did it!

609
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,640
Right.
In bed, right now.

610
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,880
Ah, don't you hear
those kids fighting?

611
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:11,520
I haven't eaten all day.
It's 10:00.

612
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:16,200
- Why don't you put 'em to bed?
- I did. They just keep poppin' back up.

613
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,760
They miss their mother, Michael.
They're out of control.

614
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:21,480
They spilled
some Coke, Amy.

615
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:25,160
- I'll get it in a minute.
- In a minute? It is soaking into the rug!

616
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:27,960
Don't yell at me. I am workin'
overtime to help you out.

617
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:29,880
Okay.

618
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,520
Where are the paper towels?

619
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,000
There are no paper towels.

620
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:41,600
Jesus Christ, I am in a crisis here.
I need some help.

621
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,800
I need someone that can look around the
house, and when there are no paper towels...

622
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:49,040
they go to the goddam store
and buy some paper towels.

623
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:51,680
I mean, how many goddam stores do you
pass on the way home from school...

624
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,520
that are filled
with paper towels?

625
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:57,160
I need someone to use a little
common sense around here.

626
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:04,160
Why don't you get
somebody else?

627
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:13,080
Amy. Amy. Amy.

628
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:17,320
Amy, I-I wa... Amy, I didn't... I
was kidding. I... Amy, I might have...

629
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:24,520
Oh, no.

630
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:29,480
Oh, no. No.

631
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:38,480
- Bob. ... make a call,
please hang up and try again.

632
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:45,520
- I'm not gonna do it.
- I don't have another choice, Jess.

633
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:50,560
- This isn't fair.
- Well, you know, sometimes life isn't fair.

634
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,680
- Hi, Lisa.
- Hi, Gigi.

635
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:55,720
I told you, Jess, they're tryin'
to get rid of the experienced pilots.

636
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:58,880
- They wanna bring in kids.
- Kids can't fly planes.

637
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:02,440
Not kid kids.
Men kids.

638
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:05,480
- I'm not living with her, and you can't make me.
- It's four days, Jess.

639
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:08,760
- Four days.
- Well, why can't we live with Amy? She loves us.

640
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,840
I tried that.
She won't talk to me.

641
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,440
- Well, whose fault is that?
- Look now, this is not a vote.

642
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:16,960
- I am your father. I'm asking...
- No, you're not.

643
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:20,120
Oh, yes, I am. I am the only
father you've got, little girl.

644
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:25,720
- Okay, here it is.
- I know things are tough, Jess.

645
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:27,640
But Mommy's sick...

646
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:32,040
and I'm all alone,
and we need to pitch in.

647
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:34,200
It's time
you understand that.

648
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:37,640
I'm gonna go to my dad.

649
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:41,480
Your dad calls you from Oregon
maybe twice a year.

650
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:47,880
Plenty of times. All the time.
And you don't know!

651
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,280
- I'm sorry, babe. I didn't mean that.
- I'm gonna go to my mom!

652
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,640
Shit!

653
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:58,880
- Jess. Jess.
- I'm goin' to my mom!

654
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:01,560
- Jess.
- I want her.

655
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,880
- I want my mom!
- I know. I know, sweetie.

656
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,760
Let go of me.
Stop it!

657
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,320
- Stop it! Let me...
- I know. It's okay.

658
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:12,640
- Let me go! I want my mom!
- We'll work it out. Okay, we'll work it out.

659
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,560
We'll work it out.

660
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,920
- I want my mom.
- I want your mom too.

661
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:32,000
What's wrong?

662
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:35,840
It's no fun to eat shit.

663
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,600
So don't.

664
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:40,520
Then you'd be
stuck with Grandma.

665
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:47,400
Let's go in.

666
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:52,240
Come on.

667
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,840
Wait for me here.

668
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:10,240
You.

669
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:12,160
Me?

670
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:16,440
What did you just say
about me?

671
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:19,440
That you were the one
with the paper towels.

672
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:27,600
Guilty. I'm very sorry
I did that.

673
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:30,080
Can I talk to you a second
in the kitchen or someplace?

674
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,960
Don't bother. Nobody speaks English,
except my cousin Vu.

675
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:35,960
And I'd love to hear this.

676
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,520
Uh, okay.

677
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:47,160
I got a trip.

678
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:49,720
If I don't go,
I get fired.

679
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:52,040
I don't wanna leave Jess
with her grandma.

680
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,440
Why is this my problem?

681
01:04:58,280 --> 01:05:01,480
Actually, it's not.

682
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:04,360
So, you're
basically begging?

683
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:11,920
Well, it worked.

684
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,560
You gonna leave
without saying goodbye?

685
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:30,760
It's okay. You don't
have to tell me nothin'.

686
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:35,840
Ready to go, huh?

687
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:40,920
I don't know.

688
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:45,160
I don't know how I'm gonna
do anything any more.

689
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,760
You know, you're supposed
to give me an answer here.

690
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:59,200
You're supposed to say something very
encouraging. This is why you get those big bucks.

691
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:01,400
No, no.

692
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,320
They tried to tell me that shit
when I first went home...

693
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:06,200
and it never did me
a damn bit of good.

694
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,920
- When you first went home?
- Yeah, that's right.

695
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:13,000
Two-time loser.

696
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:19,520
I know you're scared shitless,
'cause I sure as hell was.

697
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:24,840
There's no easy way
through it.

698
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,280
You just gotta
do the work.

699
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:34,160
I'm gonna disappoint him.

700
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,800
This is not the person
that he married.

701
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:40,600
I don't know who
this is supposed to be now.

702
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,760
Well, who was
the other person?

703
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:47,560
Well, every now and then, let's face it,
she was... she was a blast.

704
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,080
A- And I'm not
gonna be fun.

705
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:59,280
Mm-hmm. That's exactly
what happened to me...

706
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,200
when I first went home.

707
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:03,240
Exactly.

708
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:07,840
So everything turned out
okay in the end, right?

709
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:11,080
No. We got divorced.

710
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:42,840
Oh, sacred place
It's with my soul and body

711
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:45,160
There's a rainbow above me

712
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:49,200
That the storm clouds hide
and calm

713
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:52,880
We will never die

714
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,400
But the magic, it comes

715
01:07:55,520 --> 01:07:58,840
Springs from above

716
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:03,760
Love

717
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,880
Love

718
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:25,840
We laugh sometimes but it's
a little word like love

719
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:30,440
Make our earthly home
heaven above

720
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:35,600
And there is no sorrow
heaven cannot heal

721
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:37,880
A fire within

722
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,120
No cross, no crown

723
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:49,280
Runnin' from mercy
heavin' and cold

724
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:54,080
Swim in our sleep
down in oceans of joy

725
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:58,880
Died in the arms
of a natural life

726
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:03,520
Wakin' our happiness
drowning in life

727
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:08,040
Wakin' our happiness
drowning in life

728
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:09,960
Ooh-ooh

729
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:15,440
Ooh-ooh

730
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:19,000
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

731
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:23,920
Ooh-ooh

732
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:28,680
Wake 'em up.

733
01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:34,760
Come on. Wake 'em up.
You're dyin' to wake 'em up.

734
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:37,960
I promised them.

735
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:47,720
Mommy.

736
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:49,720
- Hi.
- Michael...

737
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:52,680
you said
you'd wake me up.

738
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:55,800
Mommy.

739
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:59,360
- Casey.
- Jessie, shh-shh-shh.

740
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,280
Casey, it's Mom.

741
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,520
Casey.

742
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:10,080
Mommy.

743
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:55,320
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

744
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:57,640
- Stop! Stop it!
- Give me it!

745
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:00,560
- Give me it!
- Hold it! Hold it, both of you.

746
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:03,000
- She said I could use it.
- Yeah, but she's breaking it!

747
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:06,040
- Mine's already broken.
- Give me it!

748
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:09,960
- Now it's mine. Come here.
- Hey, hey, hey. Ho, ho, ho, what's the baby problems?

749
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:13,360
First guy to say one word loses,
okay? Whatever this is...

750
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:15,520
you don't need to
bother Mommy about it.

751
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:18,280
- Michael, we'll be okay.
- All short guys, upstairs.

752
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:20,840
- Because we were just... We were just sorting out...
- I'll be up in two minutes.

753
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:22,760
- Upstairs.
- We were just...

754
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:27,800
Did you hear me? Go!

755
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:30,680
Yes. Go.

756
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:35,960
We were ju... We were
just workin' it out.

757
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:40,240
Sounded like it. Finish your work.
I'll settle their hash.

758
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:42,760
We've been doin'
Walkman wars all month.

759
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:49,080
See, Michael, I would rather
handle their fights lately.

760
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:52,760
- That's all you need, babe.
- Oh. Well, what does that mean? I'm not up to it?

761
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:56,200
Oh, no. No, Mr District Attorney.
My wife is perfect.

762
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:58,760
She's really perfect.
You hear me?

763
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:03,680
Thank you for
the vote of confidence.

764
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,760
What, I'm being,
uh, overly, uh...

765
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,200
- Attentive. A little bit. Yeah.
- Attentive.

766
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:12,320
Like I'm pregnant or psychotic
or like I'm made of glass.

767
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:15,440
You're handling play dates...

768
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:18,760
polishing toilets,
shopping up a storm.

769
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:20,880
- A storm.
- Yeah, have you looked in the freezer lately?

770
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,280
Because there's like 83 cans
of frozen orange juice in there...

771
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:26,360
if you can see past
all the frozen waffles.

772
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:31,040
- The kids like 'em now.
- Ah. Oh. "Now. "

773
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:33,960
The post shameful
incarceration era.

774
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:37,640
That's what
we like to call it.

775
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:44,800
Sorry.

776
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:51,640
So, I was thinking...

777
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:59,000
about this weekend.

778
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:08,440
I call Ed and trade him
for the Mexico route.

779
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,840
- I spoke to Amy.
- Amy, yeah.

780
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:19,480
Michael, don't you think this is all
just a little bit inappropriate?

781
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:21,400
What?

782
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:25,720
I mean maybe I should learn to live in reality
before I start trying to escape from it again.

783
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:40,600
I mean, Rachel was in my group. She... She's
46. She taught Russian history at Berkeley.

784
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:42,920
She has two kids. Sh...
Her family has money...

785
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:46,920
and she was living under a bench in
Golden Gate park for three years...

786
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:49,640
before her sister
found her there.

787
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:51,920
Do you think that
can't happen to me?

788
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:03,080
Ask me how much
I want a drink right now.

789
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:15,920
How come we haven't
talked about this?

790
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:19,720
How come we haven't talked
about a lot of things?

791
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,720
I think... I think maybe
we should see someone.

792
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:27,120
A- At the place, they said
that sometimes it's good...

793
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:30,160
for a couple to see someone
who knows about this stuff.

794
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:34,240
You mean like
a licensed contractor?

795
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:40,080
You would do that?

796
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,600
Only if you were
incredibly grateful.

797
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:57,720
And this is ever since
you've been back?

798
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,120
Mm-hmm.

799
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:02,040
Mm-hmm. The... I'm, uh...

800
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,920
just agitated
and pissed off...

801
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,920
and it seems unreasonable to me,
and I... And it's...

802
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:14,920
I feel like I'm, uh,
being unfair, and, uh...

803
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:19,480
I... J... Especially to Michael, because he's
been trying to be sweet, and he's really...

804
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:22,440
He really... You know, he just
wants to be there for me.

805
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:28,320
So you're saying that there's a problem
in your marriage and that it's your fault.

806
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,800
No, I don't think that's
what she said at all.

807
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:33,760
- I'm sorry, Alice. Is that what you meant to say?
- What I heard was that...

808
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:35,560
- she's irritated and she can't get a handle on it.
- No, I didn't mean to say that...

809
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:37,640
and, Michael,
I can talk for myself.

810
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:43,360
So, how do you feel
right now?

811
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:45,960
I'm irritated.
I'm irritated.

812
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:50,520
Because he does this sometimes.
He just does this. He just...

813
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:53,440
Like he... I was trying to settle
a fight between the two girls...

814
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:57,120
and he kind of came in
and he took over.

815
01:15:57,200 --> 01:16:00,520
And it pissed me off, you know?
It just pissed me off.

816
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,600
This is since
you've been back.

817
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:04,520
Yeah. Well...

818
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:11,600
No, he's al...
He's always done that.

819
01:16:11,720 --> 01:16:14,480
- Like?
- Like the time that...

820
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:18,280
Jess wouldn't do her homework, so I said
she couldn't go to her girlfriend's house...

821
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:22,760
and he came into the kitchen,
and he took over again...

822
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:25,000
and erased
everything I did.

823
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:29,160
Belittled me
in front of them.

824
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:33,560
When was this?

825
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:40,560
When you told me I had all I could
handle with my coffee and my little spoon.

826
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:47,480
What was that about, Michael?

827
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:49,480
It was a joke,
to begin with.

828
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:52,720
And...

829
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:58,440
she was very hung over,
and I was trying to help.

830
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:04,880
So, Michael,
how do you feel?

831
01:17:08,360 --> 01:17:12,360
- Manipulated. Irritated.
- Why?

832
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:15,400
Because we're here to...
to be closer to one another.

833
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:21,000
And talking over your problems
isn't getting closer?

834
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:31,360
Michael, have you ever thought
about going to an Al-Anon meeting?

835
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:34,240
A meeting for families
of alcoholics?

836
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:45,040
Why that face, Michael?

837
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:47,200
It's the only face
I have, Janet.

838
01:18:20,160 --> 01:18:22,080
A little slutty.

839
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:24,000
- Slutty.
- Yeah.

840
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:31,520
Amish.

841
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:35,880
Not Amish enough.

842
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:39,240
It's her first boy-girl dance, Michael.
We should let her go as a girl.

843
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:50,280
It's like... yee-ha!

844
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:52,560
- Did you put that together?
- No.

845
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:55,800
That's a sad
little ensemble.

846
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:58,880
Oh, well. I forgot how good
you were at this, Michael.

847
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:04,760
It's just that I know 8- year-old boys,
and they only have one thing on their minds.

848
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:07,560
Mmm, yeah,
14-year-old girls.

849
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:13,280
I feel like
an eight-year-old right now.

850
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:15,240
You look like
a 14-year-old.

851
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:23,560
- That's sweet, right?
- Yeah.

852
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:47,800
Oh, because, you know...

853
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:50,920
- Gary, there's so much truth coming out of you.
- It is. This is the depth.

854
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:55,080
I think I'm gonna share
this tonight, if I may.

855
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:57,120
You gonna go to
the meeting tonight?

856
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:02,920
Hey. Honey, you remember
Gary, right?

857
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:06,360
Sure.

858
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:08,680
- How's it goin'?
- Good.

859
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:11,880
It's really good.
How you doin'?

860
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,200
You got a great house.
You really do.

861
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:17,120
It's her, yeah.

862
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:23,240
Excuse me.

863
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:33,560
- I'm sorry. I'm gonna go. No, I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

864
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:44,600
Tell him I'm, uh, sorry if
I inconvenienced anything.

865
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:47,680
- You know?
- Hey, hey. It's not about you, okay?

866
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,320
- I know. Okay. You take care.
- I'm sorry.

867
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:54,920
- Slow down. I love you.
- Thank you so much. Okay.

868
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,600
- I'll talk to you later.
- All right. About 3:00, I'm free, so...

869
01:20:57,680 --> 01:21:00,040
- Okay.
- Okay, good night.

870
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:21,520
Why would you suppose
he dashed off like that?

871
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:26,440
I don't know, Michael.
Could it have been your face?

872
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:29,400
You looked like
we were naked or something.

873
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:41,800
- Do you wanna ask me something?
- No.

874
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:44,200
You think this thing
with Gary is romantic?

875
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,920
I don't know what
to think about anything.

876
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,960
Well, I'm glad
to hear you say that.

877
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:57,960
We haven't sat close like that
since I can remember, Alice.

878
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:05,280
Not since I'm back,
and if you think about it...

879
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:07,320
not since a while
before that.

880
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:23,880
Gary needs me,
and that feels good.

881
01:22:25,080 --> 01:22:28,160
A- And when I'm scared,
he can't help...

882
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:30,280
and he doesn't pretend
that he can.

883
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:36,880
And it's not just Gary, Michael.
The people that I really lean on...

884
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,760
are the ones at my meetings,
and you never even ask me about them.

885
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:44,200
Don't you wonder who they are
or what we talk about?

886
01:22:44,280 --> 01:22:48,360
- I do now.
- So why don't you ask me?

887
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,880
Come on, Michael.
Let's talk about it. Okay?

888
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:00,440
I'll tell ya anything
you want to know.

889
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:08,080
Do they know how
this got started?

890
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:12,240
How I became an alcoholic?

891
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:16,400
No. They don't know that.
Nobody seems to know that.

892
01:23:18,640 --> 01:23:20,680
My dad's drinking didn't help.

893
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:22,840
The way my mother
made me feel like nothing.

894
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:26,080
Or maybe it's genetic
or I...

895
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:30,160
Nobody knows.

896
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:33,200
Did you think
this was about you?

897
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:36,840
- Why would you say that?
- Well, I don't know. You seem a little defensive.

898
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:41,400
Wh-Why would I be defensive?
Is somebody attacking me?

899
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:44,680
No. Nobody's attacking you.

900
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:51,720
Michael, I am just
hanging on here.

901
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:58,120
The girls need me really badly. I am trying
to reestablish a little credibility at school.

902
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:03,720
- I'm trying to make my meetings. - So that kind
of tells me my-my place in the batting order...

903
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:05,640
of what you need.

904
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:15,160
I'm so tired
of all this shit.

905
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:19,200
I don't wanna be angry any more.
I don't wanna...

906
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:21,960
I don't wanna feel...

907
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,840
guilty or...

908
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:30,760
sad or depressed
or frustrated...

909
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:33,160
or confused or...

910
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:36,840
Just once, for five minutes,
I wanna feel good.

911
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:49,800
- My name is Joanna.
- Hi, Joanna.

912
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:54,440
I am so grateful for Maria's topic,
uh, emotional abuse.

913
01:24:54,560 --> 01:24:56,360
Until I came to Al-Anon...

914
01:24:56,480 --> 01:25:01,320
I was not even aware of how cruelly
I was abused by my alcoholic husband...

915
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:05,880
because I did not
own my own feelings.

916
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,160
Every waking hour was about
my husband's feelings.

917
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:11,080
When he was down,
I was lower.

918
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:15,360
When he was happy,
I thought I was too.

919
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:17,280
Every day I walked
in that door...

920
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:19,640
waiting to see
what shape he was in...

921
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:21,840
so I could find out
how I was gonna feel.

922
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:25,000
Now, thanks
to this programme...

923
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,800
I not only have
my own feelings...

924
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:32,640
but I have feelings
about my feelings.

925
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:36,200
And I am so grateful.

926
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:38,920
Anyway, thanks.

927
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:41,720
Thank you, Joanna.

928
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:44,240
All right, as you know,
we have no dues or fees...

929
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:48,400
so we're gonna continue sharing
as Bob passes the basket around.

930
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:10,440
- Hi.
- Hi.

931
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:23,440
- You okay?
- Never better.

932
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:27,360
What happened?
Somethin' at A.A.?

933
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:33,960
Uh, I'll be okay.
It's just a really bad day.

934
01:26:34,040 --> 01:26:36,520
You wanna tell me
what's wrong?

935
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:40,040
- Somethin' I can do?
- Thank you, but...

936
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:42,440
Can't fix it unless
we know it's broke.

937
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:50,120
How was your meeting?

938
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:53,640
First time.
I'll get used to it.

939
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:01,960
There was a lot of people there
feeling sorry for themselves.

940
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:04,720
It's like an alcoholic has ruined their lives,
and they'd rather... rather be a victim...

941
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:07,720
than try and fix it.

942
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:15,760
Fix it, huh?

943
01:27:18,640 --> 01:27:20,440
What'd I do now, Alice?

944
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:24,120
Nothing, Michael.
Nothing.

945
01:27:26,240 --> 01:27:28,120
I'm talking about some losers
at my meeting.

946
01:27:28,240 --> 01:27:30,040
You're takin' it personally.

947
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:35,520
The trouble with all these losers
at your meeting...

948
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:38,920
is that they're not perfect
like some people.

949
01:27:39,040 --> 01:27:41,720
They're married to alcoholics
who are bouncing off the walls...

950
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:44,040
and they don't know
what the fuck to do.

951
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:46,480
So you might have to be
a little tolerant...

952
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:50,920
give them the benefit of your
expertise in problem solving.

953
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:56,760
Good meeting, huh?
You guys drop acid or something?

954
01:27:58,440 --> 01:28:00,840
Like I said...

955
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:03,240
I'm having
a really bad day...

956
01:28:03,360 --> 01:28:06,120
and I don't mean
to take it out on you.

957
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:08,520
What is it? You want
a drink real bad?

958
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:13,800
That wouldn't distinguish it
from any other day, Michael.

959
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:17,200
- One of your friends fall off the wagon?
- Nothing happened, Michael.

960
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:20,760
Nothing has to happen for me to have a bad
day. That's the thrilling part of all this.

961
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:25,440
It just comes and hits and runs me over
like a goddam freight train.

962
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:29,360
Okay, when's the next freight train
comin' through? You got a printed schedule?

963
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:34,120
'Cause I could plan around
these things, you know, and...

964
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:38,520
give you the space so you can,
you know, smoke.

965
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:51,720
Maybe you shouldn't
have to, Michael.

966
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:54,640
One of the women at my meetings
is going to a halfway house...

967
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:57,800
because she... she's not making it
in her home environment, and I...

968
01:28:57,880 --> 01:28:59,720
What?

969
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:04,840
- You're actually thinking about this.
- Oh, now wait.

970
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:07,720
Don't start jumping
to conclusions.

971
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:10,240
What?

972
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:13,360
Excuse me for taking
my life personally, Alice.

973
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:16,960
What is wrong
with our home?

974
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:18,880
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

975
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:21,160
You said it. It was something.
What is it? Huh?

976
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:23,120
Is it the couch?

977
01:29:23,240 --> 01:29:28,640
Is it an area rug? Or is it
possibly, Alice... Alicia... me?

978
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:31,400
- Is it me?
- It's not your problem.

979
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:34,560
No, it's not my problem!
It's just my fucking fault!

980
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:37,200
Everything is my fault!

981
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:40,880
My sick wife is not making it in
her home environment! Why, exactly?

982
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:45,200
I mean I am not
your problem.

983
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:50,280
I am not
your problem to solve!

984
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:53,840
It was so much more fun in the old days,
wasn't it, Michael?

985
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:56,680
I'd get drunk, I'd pass out,
and you'd put me back together.

986
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:59,800
That was the best, huh?

987
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:01,720
That made you feel good.

988
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:04,840
And that's what hurts.

989
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:22,400
- Okay.
- Oh, fuck that!

990
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:27,200
Fuck making it better, Michael!
It's not getting better!

991
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:31,760
I don't know how to make it better,
and I swear to God, you don't either.

992
01:30:31,880 --> 01:30:34,000
Baby...

993
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:35,960
Every time you say that...

994
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:40,040
every time you look at me
like that, Michael...

995
01:30:40,160 --> 01:30:42,280
I wanna come
right out of my skin.

996
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:48,080
You make me feel like
a stupid, worthless...

997
01:30:48,200 --> 01:30:50,000
weak animal.

998
01:30:57,720 --> 01:30:59,600
I don't know how
to try any more.

999
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:02,840
Not giving up.
Sticking together.

1000
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:04,760
Isn't that what we're
supposed to be trying for?

1001
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:06,680
No, Michael.

1002
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:09,640
We're supposed
to try to be real.

1003
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:14,920
And when you feel alone, you are
not together, and that is real.

1004
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:18,120
And when you don't know,
you just don't know.

1005
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,320
I think I could
love you again...

1006
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:32,200
if you could just for once say,
"I don't know. "

1007
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:43,640
I don't know.

1008
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:54,600
Didn't work, did it?

1009
01:31:57,200 --> 01:31:59,640
I'll go pack some stuff.

1010
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:02,600
- Michael, I didn't ask you to do that.
- No, Alice?

1011
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:04,840
- No. No.
- No?

1012
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:08,520
Come on.
Let's be real.

1013
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:15,240
You're clean. You stay
hopeless and confused.

1014
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:19,120
Keep polishing those skills,
and I'll take the heat...

1015
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:21,280
'cause I got some needs
of my own.

1016
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:23,240
When I touch someone...

1017
01:32:23,360 --> 01:32:25,880
I like it better when
their skin doesn't crawl.

1018
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,960
- That's not what I meant.
- My wife hurts.

1019
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:31,240
I need to say:

1020
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:34,240
"What's wrong, honey?
Somethin' I can do?"

1021
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:37,960
And "I love you. "

1022
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:41,480
So fuck me.

1023
01:33:07,720 --> 01:33:09,560
Hey.

1024
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:12,840
What's the matter, baby?

1025
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:20,040
You guys were really loud.

1026
01:33:20,160 --> 01:33:21,960
Oh.

1027
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:24,560
Where's Michael?

1028
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:27,600
He's out.
So, are you...

1029
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:31,160
Are you getting all excited
about Ashley's sleep-over?

1030
01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:33,480
I'm not going.

1031
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:37,920
You're not going? Why?
What changed your mind?

1032
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,400
I didn't get to be invited.

1033
01:33:43,600 --> 01:33:45,440
Everybody hates me.

1034
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:52,600
Oh. Hey, sweetheart,
that's not possible.

1035
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:55,600
Is this Ashley Barrows?

1036
01:33:56,760 --> 01:33:58,760
Ashley Canter?
Ashley Goodrich?

1037
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:01,280
- No.
- Ashley Whipsnade?

1038
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:05,280
- There is no Ashley Whipsnade.
- There is too. I can prove it.

1039
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:21,040
Michael moved out.

1040
01:34:21,160 --> 01:34:22,960
For a while.

1041
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:27,880
But I'm here,
and we're gonna be fine.

1042
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:34,520
He left us?

1043
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:40,240
- Don't blame him.
- But how could he leave us?

1044
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:44,480
You blame me.
I messed up, baby.

1045
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:50,680
But I'm fighting my way back,
so, you help me...

1046
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:53,280
and don't you blame him.

1047
01:34:53,360 --> 01:34:55,200
Not ever.

1048
01:35:09,600 --> 01:35:12,000
Hey. Double trouble.

1049
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:14,840
- Where have you been?
- I've been on a trip.

1050
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:17,400
- Are you ready for the beach?
- Where you been?

1051
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:20,040
I told 'em you were
staying with Peter.

1052
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:26,720
It's only until
Mommy feels better.

1053
01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:28,800
Mommy feels better already.

1054
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:32,840
See how well it's working?

1055
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:37,000
Are you guys
getting a divorce?

1056
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:41,840
Hey. Don't be silly, baby.

1057
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:45,680
You guys go have
a great time.

1058
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:51,880
Let's go.
Up you go.

1059
01:35:57,160 --> 01:35:58,960
- Bye.
- Bye.

1060
01:36:12,120 --> 01:36:14,600
When your day is long

1061
01:36:17,720 --> 01:36:19,680
And the night

1062
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:22,640
The night is yours alone

1063
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:30,400
And you're sure
you've had enough

1064
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:34,120
Of this life

1065
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,800
Hang on

1066
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:45,760
Don't let yourself go

1067
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:52,240
'Cause everybody cries

1068
01:36:56,640 --> 01:37:00,400
Everybody hurts

1069
01:37:01,680 --> 01:37:04,320
Sometimes

1070
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:10,720
Sometimes
everything is wrong

1071
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:18,120
Now it's time
to sing along

1072
01:37:18,240 --> 01:37:22,120
- When your day is night alone
- Hold on

1073
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:25,640
Hold on

1074
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:29,000
- If you feel like lettin' go
- Hold on

1075
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,600
If you think
you've had too much

1076
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:40,440
Of this life

1077
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:43,880
Hang on

1078
01:37:47,880 --> 01:37:52,040
'Cause everybody hurts

1079
01:37:55,160 --> 01:37:58,480
Take comfort
in your friends

1080
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:07,600
'Cause everybody hurts

1081
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:13,000
Take comfort
in your friends

1082
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:16,080
- Hi. I'm Michael.
- Hi, Michael.

1083
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:20,600
I've been coming here for...

1084
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:24,640
four months.

1085
01:38:24,720 --> 01:38:26,600
This is the first time
I've talked.

1086
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:31,840
My wife is an alcoholic,
and we're separated.

1087
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:35,400
And she's doing great.

1088
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:40,120
She has her life, uh, back.
She seems to have her life back.

1089
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:45,960
I, on the other hand,
I'm not doin' so good...

1090
01:38:46,040 --> 01:38:47,880
which is funny, I guess.

1091
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:56,440
I miss my wife.

1092
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:59,920
And I miss my daughters.

1093
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:03,720
And things at work...

1094
01:39:05,080 --> 01:39:06,920
Basically everywhere...

1095
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:13,960
I can't get
a handle on things.

1096
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:24,640
Everything's loose and...

1097
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:26,560
fuzzy.

1098
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:33,920
I look at her now when I
drop off the kids at the house...

1099
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:38,440
and I see what a wonderful job she's
doin' with the kids, and I wonder why.

1100
01:39:40,680 --> 01:39:42,600
That maybe she never
really needed me...

1101
01:39:42,680 --> 01:39:45,360
as much as I thought
she needed me.

1102
01:39:47,480 --> 01:39:50,000
She thinks the girls
need more watching after.

1103
01:39:53,160 --> 01:39:56,040
Especially Casey.
She's our youngest.

1104
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,920
You think they're growin' up fine
on automatic pilot.

1105
01:40:04,200 --> 01:40:08,520
But, uh, you really have to watch them
closely because, you know, y... They just...

1106
01:40:10,320 --> 01:40:13,080
They're always hiding stuff,
even from themselves.

1107
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:21,160
Anyway...

1108
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:25,240
I like coming here.

1109
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:29,000
Thank you, Michael.

1110
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:06,920
Oh, you did? Really?

1111
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:19,440
Well, it's, um... Yeah,
I guess it's a speech.

1112
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:23,400
At my meetings, when you have six
months, you stand up and tell your story.

1113
01:41:24,680 --> 01:41:26,760
That's all.

1114
01:41:26,840 --> 01:41:28,880
And it's, uh,
a week from Saturday.

1115
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:32,640
And I'd really
like you to come.

1116
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:40,200
What? I'm not gonna say
bad stuff about you.

1117
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:42,120
Oh, you're gonna lie, huh?

1118
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:46,600
I'm gonna accept
responsibility.

1119
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:48,720
That's what it's for.

1120
01:41:48,840 --> 01:41:51,840
No wonder I'm confused.

1121
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:55,760
- I'd really like you to come.
- Well, I'll sleep on you... it.

1122
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:04,280
- You wanna go home with me, huh?
- Never entered my mind.

1123
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:06,320
- Enters mine.
- Really?

1124
01:42:06,440 --> 01:42:11,080
Yeah, all the time.
I just don't know...

1125
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:15,440
what it would be like, because I'm really
afraid of that roller coaster thing.

1126
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:17,960
- Oh, I hate that.
- You know, when people break up and then they make up...

1127
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:20,360
- and they break up and they make up, and the very thing...
- People can be so immature.

1128
01:42:20,440 --> 01:42:23,880
that attracts them is the reason
that they shouldn't be together.

1129
01:42:23,960 --> 01:42:26,440
And I can't do that,
Michael.

1130
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:28,840
I can't do that any more.

1131
01:42:47,480 --> 01:42:49,720
I'm moving to Denver.

1132
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:56,360
They're talking about roll-backs
in this domicile, and if I...

1133
01:42:56,480 --> 01:42:59,880
take the transfer, I have a...
I have a better chance to keep flying.

1134
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:11,640
It's either that or change airlines, and
I'd have to start from the bottom scale.

1135
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:15,080
So I told 'em that I'd have
to talk to you first...

1136
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:17,000
before I could commit.

1137
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:30,000
Well, you've worked a lot of years
to just start at... at the bottom.

1138
01:43:40,520 --> 01:43:42,560
I can bid for
the San Francisco route.

1139
01:43:44,480 --> 01:43:46,720
And with passes and
everything, I can s...

1140
01:43:52,200 --> 01:43:54,920
This accepting responsibility stuff
is really fun.

1141
01:44:04,080 --> 01:44:06,200
I better go home.

1142
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:09,800
- I-I...
- Don't go yet.

1143
01:44:09,880 --> 01:44:11,720
- I gotta go.
- Don't go.

1144
01:44:37,360 --> 01:44:40,400
Hey, partner.
Can I see that?

1145
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:45,040
Thought Mom was gonna pick me up
after movement class.

1146
01:44:45,160 --> 01:44:47,320
She is. I'm just here
for a visit.

1147
01:44:48,280 --> 01:44:50,120
It's a bug box.

1148
01:44:51,560 --> 01:44:54,280
Just wanna see it.
Ooh.

1149
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:59,080
I like a name that
tells you what it is.

1150
01:45:01,160 --> 01:45:03,720
How come you're here?

1151
01:45:07,320 --> 01:45:09,160
Come here.

1152
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:17,680
I came to say I'm sorry.

1153
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:23,560
I'm sorry for the fight we had the
other day at the park. That was my fault.

1154
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,920
And I'm sorry for not making it
better when Mommy was away.

1155
01:45:30,120 --> 01:45:31,920
Wasn't so bad.

1156
01:45:35,480 --> 01:45:38,200
I'm really sorry for
almost leaving you with Grandma.

1157
01:45:43,120 --> 01:45:46,680
But mostly I'm sorry for the
kind of daddy I was or wasn't...

1158
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:48,840
all the time
since I've known you.

1159
01:45:51,800 --> 01:45:53,640
Why are you saying this?

1160
01:46:01,720 --> 01:46:04,120
I'm leaving
for Denver tonight.

1161
01:46:07,480 --> 01:46:09,320
I'm moving there.

1162
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:14,720
You and Mommy are
getting divorced.

1163
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:17,800
No, no one's even
talked about that.

1164
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:20,000
And if that were
to ever happen...

1165
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:24,280
I'd get lots of free passes,
and I'd call you all the time...

1166
01:46:24,400 --> 01:46:26,920
and I'd come to visit
all the time.

1167
01:46:33,040 --> 01:46:35,080
'Cause Casey will
still be your daughter?

1168
01:46:35,160 --> 01:46:39,400
No. 'Cause you're
my daughter...

1169
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:42,720
and I will always
come back to see you.

1170
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:46,640
I will always come back.

1171
01:46:52,840 --> 01:46:55,040
Not like my dad?

1172
01:46:55,120 --> 01:46:58,320
I love you so much.
Just like your real daddy.

1173
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:03,680
But I'm really scared.
I'm really scared.

1174
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:05,760
I'm scared that you
don't know how much I love you...

1175
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:09,880
and so I'll always have to be
doing stuff so you'll know.

1176
01:47:13,640 --> 01:47:15,560
I'll try to do stuff too.

1177
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:22,880
You have to go there, huh?

1178
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:27,320
Yeah.

1179
01:47:35,200 --> 01:47:37,000
Oh.

1180
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:46,160
I'm gonna miss you
so much.

1181
01:47:48,920 --> 01:47:50,760
I'm sorry, baby.

1182
01:47:52,280 --> 01:47:54,120
You can do it.

1183
01:47:54,200 --> 01:47:58,120
You can do it.
You can do it.

1184
01:47:58,240 --> 01:48:00,040
You can do it.

1185
01:48:07,120 --> 01:48:10,280
Hey there, buster.

1186
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:12,320
You goin' on a trip?

1187
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:18,600
Boo. Bad decision.

1188
01:48:20,480 --> 01:48:22,280
Cat got your tongue?

1189
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:28,440
It's a long trip this time.

1190
01:48:28,560 --> 01:48:30,600
Like Mommy's trip?

1191
01:48:30,680 --> 01:48:34,800
Maybe longer, but I'm
gonna call ya every day.

1192
01:48:34,920 --> 01:48:39,360
Every day. And I'll be back
every chance I get.

1193
01:48:39,440 --> 01:48:41,280
And when I can't...

1194
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:44,360
you'll come visit me.

1195
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:46,280
Like Mommy?

1196
01:48:47,480 --> 01:48:51,520
- Yeah.
- Will there be swans?

1197
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:54,680
Swans?
Swans are possible.

1198
01:49:03,560 --> 01:49:05,880
- Bye, baby.
- Bye, baby.

1199
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:31,720
Thank you for
the fan appreciation, folks.

1200
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:34,600
It was a lot less dramatic
than it looked.

1201
01:49:34,680 --> 01:49:38,480
For those of you connecting out of Denver,
please check your monitors for any delays...

1202
01:49:38,600 --> 01:49:40,520
and for the rest of you...

1203
01:49:44,200 --> 01:49:46,000
welcome home.

1204
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:54,800
Hi, I-I'm Alice,
um, alcoholic.

1205
01:49:54,920 --> 01:49:56,720
Hi, Alice!

1206
01:49:56,840 --> 01:49:59,960
I've been sober
for 184 days.

1207
01:50:07,160 --> 01:50:09,920
I- I drank my first beer
when I was nine years old.

1208
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:14,440
My dad's an alcoholic, so my mother
liked to blame my lapse on his example.

1209
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:17,080
That way she could hurt
both of us at once.

1210
01:50:18,720 --> 01:50:21,720
Anyway, I liked my beer,
and the ones that followed.

1211
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:25,680
And about a year ago
I got drunk.

1212
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:27,600
I couldn't stop getting drunk.

1213
01:50:27,720 --> 01:50:31,240
It had never really happened quite
like that, and I still don't know why.

1214
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:35,720
I've lied to everyone
that I know...

1215
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:38,880
everyone I love, and, uh...

1216
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:42,120
I was ashamed and terrified
and humiliated every day.

1217
01:50:44,720 --> 01:50:49,040
Uh, one day I...
got out of the shower...

1218
01:50:49,160 --> 01:50:52,360
grabbed a towel and decided
to go get the paper.

1219
01:50:52,480 --> 01:50:55,160
And nobody saw me go out
the front door or at the curb...

1220
01:50:55,280 --> 01:51:00,440
which was a very good thing because I was
holding the towel just folded in my hand.

1221
01:51:06,080 --> 01:51:08,400
I know how lucky I've been...

1222
01:51:08,520 --> 01:51:13,160
because there were times when I drove my
little girls around just ripped out of my mind.

1223
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:15,400
One Saturday I took
my baby girl on errands...

1224
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:17,320
and when I got home...

1225
01:51:18,600 --> 01:51:20,400
I realized
she wasn't with me.

1226
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:24,880
I had left her someplace.

1227
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:28,880
And since I couldn't remember
where I'd been...

1228
01:51:29,000 --> 01:51:30,920
I had no idea where, so...

1229
01:51:37,240 --> 01:51:40,560
I spent the next few hours
calling every shop I'd ever been to...

1230
01:51:40,680 --> 01:51:43,960
until finally the tile guy
rang my front doorbell.

1231
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:47,080
They had found my address
on a check.

1232
01:51:49,040 --> 01:51:50,920
I rewarded him,
of course, you know...

1233
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:52,840
by never going back
to his store.

1234
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,520
My bottom was 184 days ago...

1235
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:02,560
when my, uh,
my little girl...

1236
01:52:02,640 --> 01:52:06,800
watched me wash down
aspirin with vodka.

1237
01:52:08,720 --> 01:52:10,560
And then I hit her.

1238
01:52:13,680 --> 01:52:16,840
And when I passed out,
she was alone with me...

1239
01:52:16,920 --> 01:52:18,760
and she thought I was dead.

1240
01:52:23,680 --> 01:52:28,000
And all of my life I will
never know what that did to her.

1241
01:52:31,880 --> 01:52:34,160
And I know I have to
forgive myself for that.

1242
01:52:37,480 --> 01:52:40,360
And I have to forgive myself for
what I've done to my husband.

1243
01:52:42,280 --> 01:52:45,920
It's horrifying how much you can hate
yourself for being low and weak...

1244
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:48,560
and he couldn't save me from that,
so I turned it on him.

1245
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:52,640
I tried to empty it onto him,
but there was always more, you know?

1246
01:52:54,280 --> 01:52:56,080
When he tried to help,
I told him that...

1247
01:52:56,200 --> 01:52:59,200
he made me feel small
and worthless.

1248
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:04,280
But nobody makes us
feel that, man.

1249
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:06,200
We do that for ourselves.

1250
01:53:08,440 --> 01:53:10,320
I shut him out because...

1251
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:14,600
I knew if he ever really saw...

1252
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:16,560
who I was inside...

1253
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:19,600
that he wouldn't love me.

1254
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:25,720
And we're separated now.

1255
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:30,520
He's moved away, and it was
so hard not to beg him to stay.

1256
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:39,240
And I don't know if I'm gonna get a
second chance, but I have to believe...

1257
01:53:39,320 --> 01:53:41,200
that I deserve one.

1258
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:44,400
Because we all do.

1259
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:07,000
Thank you, Alice. Everyone,
let's take a 15-minute coffee break.

1260
01:54:08,360 --> 01:54:10,160
Thanks.

1261
01:54:11,120 --> 01:54:13,200
Just so beautiful.

1262
01:54:13,320 --> 01:54:15,120
I just hope I can do it too.

1263
01:54:15,240 --> 01:54:17,040
How do you feel?
Like a cigarette?

1264
01:54:17,160 --> 01:54:18,760
- Yes. Thank you, Sponsor.
- You're welcome.

1265
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:20,760
- That was wonderful.
- Thanks for letting me talk.

1266
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:23,480
Alice, you really made me cry.

1267
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:25,720
Me too.

1268
01:54:32,360 --> 01:54:34,160
Me too.

1269
01:54:37,360 --> 01:54:39,160
My wife is an alcoholic.

1270
01:54:41,720 --> 01:54:43,560
Best person I ever met.

1271
01:54:47,120 --> 01:54:49,360
She has 600 different
kinds of smiles.

1272
01:54:50,680 --> 01:54:52,520
They can light up your life.

1273
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:57,640
They can make you laugh
out loud just like that.

1274
01:54:59,480 --> 01:55:01,680
They can even make you cry
just like that.

1275
01:55:04,680 --> 01:55:06,520
That's just with her smiles.

1276
01:55:08,680 --> 01:55:11,240
You'd have to see her
with her kids.

1277
01:55:11,320 --> 01:55:13,200
You'd have to see
how they look at her...

1278
01:55:15,200 --> 01:55:17,320
when she's not looking.

1279
01:55:20,480 --> 01:55:22,600
To think of all the things
she lived through...

1280
01:55:22,680 --> 01:55:24,520
and I couldn't help her.

1281
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:29,560
- Maybe helping wasn't your job.
- The hell it wasn't.

1282
01:55:29,680 --> 01:55:31,720
See, I love her.

1283
01:55:34,480 --> 01:55:36,840
And I tried everything.

1284
01:55:36,920 --> 01:55:39,160
Except really listening.

1285
01:55:39,280 --> 01:55:41,320
Really listening.

1286
01:55:41,400 --> 01:55:43,320
And that's how
I left her alone.

1287
01:55:46,360 --> 01:55:49,080
I'm so ashamed of that...

1288
01:55:49,200 --> 01:55:51,960
and I couldn't even tell her.

1289
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:53,880
Maybe if I tell her,
she'd love me anyway.

1290
01:55:54,920 --> 01:55:57,360
Oh, more.

1291
01:55:58,640 --> 01:56:00,600
She would have loved you
even more.

1292
01:56:08,080 --> 01:56:10,560
I think you should tell
all this stuff to your wife.

1293
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:25,600
Hold me, love

1294
01:57:27,560 --> 01:57:31,240
I can't sleep again

1295
01:57:31,360 --> 01:57:34,960
Ooh, I have
to kiss your lips

1296
01:57:35,080 --> 01:57:39,600
I wanna lay here
next to you

1297
01:57:39,720 --> 01:57:41,560
Oh

1298
01:57:42,680 --> 01:57:46,280
I remember

1299
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:48,320
Walkin' in the rain

1300
01:57:50,200 --> 01:57:53,320
Rain was falling
on my head

1301
01:57:53,440 --> 01:57:57,840
I don't wanna live
through that again

1302
01:57:57,960 --> 01:57:59,760
No

1303
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,840
Outside

1304
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:08,600
It oughta get dark now

1305
01:58:08,720 --> 01:58:11,160
Love is walkin'
in the park now

1306
01:58:12,680 --> 01:58:14,480
Children singin' songs

1307
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:18,960
One day we'll make
all our dreams come true

1308
01:58:19,080 --> 01:58:21,920
I will love you

1309
01:58:23,720 --> 01:58:25,800
It only takes love

1310
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:31,400
Love is a healing thing

1311
01:58:31,480 --> 01:58:34,240
When you give everything

1312
01:58:36,080 --> 01:58:38,160
You love in the world

1313
01:58:38,280 --> 01:58:42,280
The world gives you love
to hold on to

1314
01:58:43,440 --> 01:58:45,520
Remember me

1315
01:58:47,120 --> 01:58:51,880
When sorrow is over

1316
01:58:54,840 --> 01:58:58,760
- Somewhere
- Just give me many chances

1317
01:58:58,840 --> 01:59:01,960
- Oh, no
- I'll see you through, my love

1318
01:59:02,040 --> 01:59:06,760
- The memories
- Just give me time to learn, to grow

1319
01:59:10,280 --> 01:59:13,920
Just give me many chances

1320
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:17,480
I'll see you through, my love

1321
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:21,560
Just give me time
to learn, to grow

1322
01:59:25,040 --> 01:59:28,720
Just give me many chances

1323
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:32,360
I'll see you through, my love

1324
01:59:32,480 --> 01:59:36,480
Just give me time
to learn, to grow

1325
01:59:38,640 --> 01:59:40,920
In September

1326
01:59:42,640 --> 01:59:46,160
When the rain comes

1327
01:59:46,280 --> 01:59:49,440
And the wind blows

1328
01:59:49,520 --> 01:59:52,840
I will see you walking
in your coat

1329
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:54,640
Oh

1330
01:59:54,760 --> 01:59:58,280
Just give me many chances

1331
01:59:58,360 --> 02:00:01,720
I'll see you through, my love

1332
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:05,840
Just give me time
to learn, to grow

1333
02:00:06,920 --> 02:00:10,240
Time to learn, to grow

1334
02:00:10,320 --> 02:00:13,480
Time to learn,
to grow
