1
00:00:18,967 --> 00:00:21,772
It's alright.

2
00:00:22,207 --> 00:00:23,926
He's just for show.

3
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,606
What are you looking for?

4
00:00:30,293 --> 00:00:32,915
A Volvo 940.

5
00:00:33,316 --> 00:00:36,657
- What's it look like?
- Like a Volvo 940.

6
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:38,876
Alright clever dick.

7
00:00:50,934 --> 00:00:54,383
Yes! Look, a Volvo 940.

8
00:00:55,665 --> 00:00:58,055
Looks like any other car to me.

9
00:00:58,115 --> 00:01:00,498
Well you don't see them often.

10
00:01:02,859 --> 00:01:04,914
They don't buckle easily in a smash.

11
00:01:13,015 --> 00:01:14,752
You want some of this?

12
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:20,025
Right, you keep a lookout yeah?

13
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,630
- I don't like this place.
- I'll be one minute.

14
00:01:41,104 --> 00:01:44,480
Come on. I know somewhere where we
can get some money for some drink.

15
00:01:44,718 --> 00:01:46,003
What?

16
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,728
I know somewhere where we can
get some money for some drink.

17
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:51,304
Alright.

18
00:02:01,613 --> 00:02:03,213
I got it.

19
00:02:04,971 --> 00:02:06,990
You brought me luck today you did.

20
00:02:07,278 --> 00:02:10,234
Come on then, let's get wasted.

21
00:02:16,085 --> 00:02:19,155
Hold on.
That's it, stand up.

22
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:23,878
Fucking hell.

23
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:14,251
- Getcha!
- Get down.

24
00:03:17,525 --> 00:03:20,585
Get off me! Get off me!
Get down!

25
00:03:21,385 --> 00:03:24,498
- You're no fun.
- I'm supposed to be at work.

26
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:27,627
What you after?

27
00:03:28,434 --> 00:03:31,660
- We need some money.
- Oh yeah?

28
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:36,749
- You drunk?
- No.

29
00:03:38,473 --> 00:03:39,946
Can I have a fiver?

30
00:03:40,006 --> 00:03:42,094
It's my job to throw
drunks out you know?

31
00:03:42,095 --> 00:03:45,684
- Oh come off it.
- Look, i've got no money on me.

32
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:51,446
Look how skinny this boy is.

33
00:03:51,506 --> 00:03:53,577
We're starving, we need food.

34
00:03:53,637 --> 00:03:55,295
I'll pay you back.

35
00:04:09,945 --> 00:04:13,094
- I'm not a bloody kid you know!
- I know that.

36
00:05:03,042 --> 00:05:06,378
- Is there any dinner?
- It's a bit late for that now?

37
00:05:06,438 --> 00:05:08,554
What do you think this is, a café?

38
00:05:27,109 --> 00:05:29,793
<i>Thailand, anger?
I don't think so.</i>

39
00:05:29,794 --> 00:05:32,843
<i>Japan, anger? No!
Russia...</i>

40
00:05:49,517 --> 00:05:52,863
- You still got my camera?
- You want it?

41
00:05:53,847 --> 00:05:55,790
As long as it's safe.

42
00:05:56,848 --> 00:05:58,278
It's safe.

43
00:06:07,138 --> 00:06:09,142
You going out with that boy then?

44
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:13,724
Why?

45
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:19,039
- He looked a bit old for you.
- He's 19.

46
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,124
She's never had a boyfriend.

47
00:06:24,925 --> 00:06:27,062
Just fucked him upstairs actually.

48
00:06:27,122 --> 00:06:28,600
That's nice.

49
00:06:30,736 --> 00:06:32,438
You can talk.

50
00:06:33,765 --> 00:06:37,403
- Shall we go to bed?
- Yeah.

51
00:06:40,615 --> 00:06:43,294
Come on to bed Sleeping Beauty.

52
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:53,781
It's about your new school,
you get to stay there.

53
00:06:53,782 --> 00:06:56,663
You can fuck as many ASBO
boys as you like now.

54
00:07:14,756 --> 00:07:16,369
That was clever.

55
00:07:16,951 --> 00:07:18,047
I ain't going.

56
00:07:18,107 --> 00:07:20,380
That place might
teach you some manners.

57
00:07:20,538 --> 00:07:22,602
It's nothing to do with you, is it?.

58
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,910
- You need sorting out you do.
- So you keep saying.

59
00:07:27,943 --> 00:07:31,145
But you're nothing to me
so why should I listen?

60
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:05,028
<i>I can't believe it.</i>

61
00:08:07,282 --> 00:08:10,302
<i>Oh my God, he's
just so easy going.</i>

62
00:08:17,536 --> 00:08:21,102
<i>I knew it when I
saw him, I just knew.</i>

63
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,962
Oh fuck off, as if I am.

64
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,142
No i'm not.

65
00:08:28,202 --> 00:08:30,659
You know they're only
good for one thing,

66
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,837
and he is fucking excellent at that!

67
00:08:35,466 --> 00:08:37,257
I know.

68
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,344
I know, I know, don't worry
babe, you'll meet someone.

69
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,335
Yeah, of course.

70
00:08:46,749 --> 00:08:49,344
Are you going to
Anne-Marie's thing tonight?

71
00:08:50,445 --> 00:08:52,340
9, right?

72
00:08:53,415 --> 00:08:57,704
Alright then babes, see you later!

73
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:05,187
<i>You have one new message.</i>

74
00:09:05,361 --> 00:09:09,312
<i>This is a message for Mia
Williams, you sent us your video.</i>

75
00:09:09,372 --> 00:09:12,192
<i>We wondered if you'd like to
come in for an audition next week?</i>

76
00:09:12,425 --> 00:09:16,986
<i>Give us a call back
on 01708 665 001.</i>

77
00:09:17,046 --> 00:09:18,512
<i>Oh, it's Val by the way.</i>

78
00:11:29,983 --> 00:11:31,892
Put your arm round me.

79
00:11:32,235 --> 00:11:35,342
Hang on, the other arm.

80
00:11:38,926 --> 00:11:41,901
- Up the stairs, that's it.
- My baby...

81
00:11:42,151 --> 00:11:44,910
- I bloody love you.
- I know.

82
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:49,413
I'm going to sleep. You'll
be around in the morning?

83
00:11:49,473 --> 00:11:53,451
Be a big girl, i'll be around in the morning.

84
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,131
- You promise me yeah?
- I promise you.

85
00:12:46,731 --> 00:12:49,915
- You're up late?
- I've been busy.

86
00:12:57,693 --> 00:13:00,697
- Are you my friend now?
- What?

87
00:13:02,717 --> 00:13:05,305
You seemed a bit funny with
me the last few days.

88
00:13:05,306 --> 00:13:07,861
You've been funny with me.

89
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,689
Have I?

90
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:13,927
Maybe.

91
00:13:25,468 --> 00:13:28,962
- Your mum's passed out.
- She does that.

92
00:13:33,398 --> 00:13:36,476
You all love your booze
in this family don't you?

93
00:13:43,588 --> 00:13:45,591
Your hair looks nice down.

94
00:13:45,971 --> 00:13:49,827
Better than the
ponytail you usually have.

95
00:13:53,534 --> 00:13:57,516
- I've got myself an audition.
- Good girl.

96
00:14:00,016 --> 00:14:01,990
No surprise in that one.

97
00:14:05,489 --> 00:14:07,717
I borrowed one of your CDs.

98
00:14:08,201 --> 00:14:11,781
- What sound did you pick?
- "California Dreamin'".

99
00:14:12,225 --> 00:14:15,095
The one you put on in the car.

100
00:14:15,378 --> 00:14:18,087
That's my favourite song ever.

101
00:14:21,713 --> 00:14:25,177
- Do you want to show me?
- No way!

102
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:28,909
Come on, if you can't do
it in front of me now,

103
00:14:29,231 --> 00:14:32,166
how are you gonna do it in
front of all those people?

104
00:14:32,383 --> 00:14:36,094
Anyway, I think you're great already.
You know that?

105
00:14:37,147 --> 00:14:39,146
I only worked it out tonight.

106
00:14:40,013 --> 00:14:42,481
- It ain't ready really.
- Alright.

107
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:44,734
Just thought I could help.

108
00:14:48,707 --> 00:14:50,245
It's your call.

109
00:17:07,942 --> 00:17:10,019
That's all i've got so far.

110
00:17:12,501 --> 00:17:13,938
Come here.

111
00:17:20,826 --> 00:17:22,173
Come here.

112
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:34,843
That was really good.

113
00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:41,300
- You're just saying that.
- No, i'm serious.

114
00:17:42,221 --> 00:17:45,130
If it was up to me
i'd give you the job.

115
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:37,549
I bet it doesn't feel liek this
with that boy of yours does it?

116
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:38,950
No.

117
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,692
Is his cock this big?

118
00:20:34,157 --> 00:20:35,833
I'm pissed.

119
00:20:40,727 --> 00:20:42,511
That was all avoidable.

120
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:45,087
No it weren't.

121
00:20:56,133 --> 00:20:58,535
We have to keep this
between you and me.

122
00:20:59,999 --> 00:21:01,558
Yeah, I know.

123
00:21:31,771 --> 00:21:33,725
I'd better get off to bed.

124
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,565
I'm wasted.

125
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,481
We'll talk tomorrow, yeah?

126
00:22:34,715 --> 00:22:36,444
Connor's gone.

127
00:23:11,382 --> 00:23:13,208
Connor!

128
00:23:16,576 --> 00:23:17,934
Connor!

129
00:23:34,825 --> 00:23:37,047
Did I tell you I nearly had you aborted?

130
00:23:39,922 --> 00:23:42,019
I even made an appointment.

131
00:23:54,415 --> 00:23:56,496
Are you gonna phone him?

132
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:04,116
- He won't come back.
- You don't know nothing.

133
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:06,652
I know what you did,
i'm telling mum.

134
00:24:06,712 --> 00:24:08,582
I don't care what you do.

135
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:22,411
<i>This is Connor, leave us a
message and i'll get back to you.</i>

136
00:24:26,686 --> 00:24:29,192
<i>This is Connor, leave us a message...</i>

137
00:24:34,532 --> 00:24:36,684
<i>118118, how can I help you?</i>

138
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,764
<i>- Hello, Wickes in Barking please.
- One moment please.</i>

139
00:24:39,765 --> 00:24:41,942
<i>- Shall I put you through?
- Yeah.</i>

140
00:24:45,473 --> 00:24:46,811
Mia!

141
00:24:47,034 --> 00:24:50,553
<i>- I was just coming to look for you.
- Wickes, Barking, how may I help you?</i>

142
00:24:50,554 --> 00:24:53,573
Hello, can I speak to Connor
please, he works on security.

143
00:24:53,574 --> 00:24:56,999
<i>- Where you going?
- Connor O'Varner? he's nnot in this week.</i>

144
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,046
<i>- When will he be back?
- Not until next Friday.</i>

145
00:25:00,047 --> 00:25:02,689
<i>- When?
- Next Friday.</i>

146
00:25:06,699 --> 00:25:10,970
- D'you know how I can get to Tilbury?
- Yeah A13, that way.

147
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:14,130
I'll come with you.

148
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:17,431
No, i've got some personal shit
to deal with, i'll see you later.

149
00:25:55,632 --> 00:25:57,822
Excuse me, Danton Road?

150
00:25:57,882 --> 00:26:01,655
- Straight there, down there on the new
estate, it's on the right. - Thanks.

151
00:27:22,952 --> 00:27:26,029
Jesus Christ!
Come on!

152
00:27:26,976 --> 00:27:28,196
Come on!

153
00:27:31,535 --> 00:27:34,883
Look, I don't know how you found
me here but this isn't a good idea.

154
00:27:35,251 --> 00:27:38,584
- You're not answering your phone.
- My battery's dead.

155
00:27:40,887 --> 00:27:44,277
- I was gonna call you.
- You ain't even got my number.

156
00:27:48,895 --> 00:27:52,805
- You know I like you Mia.
- Well why did you leave then?

157
00:27:58,431 --> 00:28:00,613
You know why.

158
00:28:01,926 --> 00:28:03,979
Mia, you're 15 years old!

159

Where's your horse?

00:50:52,421 --> 00:50:53,966
She was sick.

236
00:50:54,955 --> 00:50:56,403
We had to shoot her.

237
00:51:40,518 --> 00:51:42,653
She was 16.

238
00:51:44,456 --> 00:51:45,792
It was her time.

239
00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:48,923
Alright.

240
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:11,110

out the motor on a long run.

241
00:52:11,618 --> 00:52:15,299
- Yeah?

246
00:53:19,210 --> 00:53:21,767
- You can have my place.
