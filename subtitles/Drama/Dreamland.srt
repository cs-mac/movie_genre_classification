Hey.

167
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:37,457
I don't want to wake anybody
up.

168
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:39,726
So, imaginary ball, you know.

169
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,729
That's sweet.

170
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,835
Hey, Dreamer, find anything
tonight?

171
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:49,870
Not yet. I'll let you know.

Does he ever find any?

175
00:12:55,943 --> 00:12:57,177
Sometimes.

176
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,450
Have you ever seen
that episode
of Jerry Springer where...

177
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:06,186
That woman goes into labour
on air?

178
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:07,687
I... I think so.

179
00:13:07,754 --> 00:13:10,390
Well, she used to live here.
Isn't that funny?

180
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,960
Well, it's not really funny.
It's actually kind of sad.

181
00:13:13,026 --> 00:13:15,795
Or at least it's sad for
the baby because it,
it's doomed, right?

182
00:13:15,863 --> 00:13:18,098
And it's kind of sad for us
because it kind of...

183
00:13:18,165 --> 00:13:21,969
Reinforces that whole
trailer park trash
stereotype thing.

I'm sorry, I'm babbling.

185
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,706
I knew a guy who was
on "Cops" once.

186
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:29,542
-Oh, really?
-Yeah. I played little
league baseball

187
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:32,179
with a guy who got pulled over
in a stolen car on "Cops."

188
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:34,381
Wait. Was he wearing a shirt?

189
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:35,983
Was he wearing a shirt when
he got pulled over?

190
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:37,317
Oh, I...

191
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:39,519
I don't think he was.

192
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:41,288
Because he had stuffed
his weed down his shorts,

193
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:43,756
so you could see
the little baggy sticking out.

194
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,192
That's incredible.

195
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:47,494
The criminals are always
topless on that show.
That's perfect.

196
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,096
Yeah, they are.

197
00:13:50,898 --> 00:13:51,965
His name is Mookie.

198
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:53,800
Mookie?

199
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:56,303
He's from Las Vegas.
He's apparently really good
at basketball.

200
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:58,638
Graduated last year and
he was going to play for UNLV.

201
00:13:58,705 --> 00:14:00,073
That's nice.

202
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,209
Yeah, but, he blew out
his knee and lost his spot,

203
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:05,312
so he's been rehabbing
all year.
Now they have an opening.

204
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:07,747
So he's gonna go back and
train with them at the end
of the summer,

205
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:09,716
and see if it's healed up.

206
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,418
What else did you find out
about him?

207
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:12,920
Does he have a girlfriend?

208
00:14:14,021 --> 00:14:15,322
I don't know.

00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:37,877
That's him.

213
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:41,181
He's dreamy.

214
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:44,017
Maybe he'll let you wear
his lettermen jacket.

215
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:46,753
You could take his picture,
put it up in your locker

216
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:49,522
and then all the girls
on the A-list will invite you
to their slumber parties.

217

I'm already on the A-list.

That's an excellent choice,
but cherry's better.

219
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:58,165
I think cherry is better
than lemon,
that's just my opinion.

Because I'd be Miss Venezuela.

And then everyone in
the country would know who
I was.

You'd get to star on one
of those Spanish soap operas.

255

I'd date, like,
a Brazilian soccer star.

who is a bruja.

the rain forest and she'd give
me this

That's why she came here,

And then I'll relate it to
my disease.

will appreciate

00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,383
I picked up the
lovely Lissa Stevens in...

323
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,486
In his mom's
'68 green Mustang.

324
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:56,456
Not green. Sea foam Mustang.

325
00:20:56,523 --> 00:21:00,293
She loved that car.
It was a great car.

326
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,230
Took her to see a, 8:00 p.m
showing of
Breakfast at Tiffany's

327
00:21:04,297 --> 00:21:05,398
at the Paramount.

328
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:07,567
I waited until
old Holly Golightly

329
00:21:07,634 --> 00:21:09,502
went looking for her cat
in the rain...

330
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:12,872
Before I reached over and
grabbed her hand.

331
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:17,644
That's got to be the sweetest
goddamn movie they ever made.

332
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:21,514
After we left the theatre,
it was raining cats and dogs.

333
00:21:21,581 --> 00:21:25,585
-Lissa was jumping through
puddles...
-She was a puddle-dancer.

334
00:21:25,652 --> 00:21:28,821
We sat in the car and let our
clothes dry.

335
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:33,726
I forgot my bowl, so we smoked
weed out of an old beer can
she found on the backseat.

336
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:35,061
It was perfect.

337
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:39,432
Just chilly and perfect.

338
00:21:41,167 --> 00:21:45,472
We took that old long cut home
and listened to some tapes...

339
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:48,875
And I walked her right up into
her dorm room.

340
00:21:50,276 --> 00:21:51,411
We almost kissed.

341
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,515
Remember this, girls,
the only thing better

342
00:21:55,582 --> 00:21:58,084
than kissing on a first date

343
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,553
is almost kissing on
a first date.

344
00:22:04,223 --> 00:22:06,659
Their courtship lasted
42 kisses.

345
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:08,395
And then they eloped.

346
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:10,196
42 kisses.

347
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:14,333
Number 43 was in a makeshift
wedding chapel down
in Roswell.

348
00:22:14,401 --> 00:22:17,003
I can still taste
that kiss.

349
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,705
Number 43.

350
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:20,407
To this very day.

351
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,878
All right, guys...

352
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:29,416
Don't stay up too late.
We've got a barbecue to go to
tomorrow.

353
00:22:29,482 --> 00:22:30,617
Good night.

354
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:31,784
Good night.

355
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,984
What do you want?
Meat or tofu?

356
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:41,721
How in the hell do you kill
a tofu?

357
00:23:42,989 --> 00:23:44,190
You got me.

358
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,960
Medium-well, por favor.

359
00:23:48,027 --> 00:23:51,097
I hear you want to be
Miss America, is that right?

360
00:23:51,163 --> 00:23:56,469
-I pray for it every night.
Like I really pray.
-That's cool.

361
00:23:56,536 --> 00:24:00,707
God, I'm almost 40 and
I still don't know what I want
to be when I grow up.

362
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:04,276
How about a travel agent?

363
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:05,878
No.

364
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,379
No?

365
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,081
A princess?

366
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:12,318
I don't think so.

367
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:15,187
A princess spy?

368
00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:17,023
That's kind of interesting.

369
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:19,659
See, I used to want to be that
and then I decide I should
give it up

370
00:24:19,726 --> 00:24:21,528
'cause I want to be
Miss America more.

371
00:24:21,594 --> 00:24:26,132
Although princess spy,
kind with secret cameras
under the tiara, kind of hot.

372
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:30,503
So, what can you tell me about
my new hometown?

373
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:35,274
Well, unfortunately,
I don't get out much.

374
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:37,476
Ever, really. I get these...

375
00:24:37,544 --> 00:24:39,111
Attacks when I try to leave.

376
00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:42,882
I couldn't even attend
Audrey's graduation ceremony.

377
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:45,585
That's a shame.

378
00:24:45,652 --> 00:24:48,755
So Herb's really, uh, likes
to do dad things, huh?

379
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:50,690
Yeah, he does.
But he's not my dad though,

380
00:24:50,757 --> 00:24:52,224
he's my mom's boyfriend.

381
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,695
No, it's cool.
I mean it's for real.

382
00:24:55,762 --> 00:24:58,264
They just haven't gotten
around to getting married.

383
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,000
I love him. He's a cool guy.

384
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:04,336
He's got this neat office,
it... It smells like Pez.

385
00:25:05,638 --> 00:25:07,239
Oh, that's neat.

386
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:08,908
Shut up.

387
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:12,879
Cool I mean. Nice office.

388
00:26:47,974 --> 00:26:49,842
His cool place...

389
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:53,145
Blue eye make-up...
A red bed...

390
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:55,481
An urge to fall into
the picture void...

391
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:57,950
Where it's always lazy
and summer...

392
00:26:58,718 --> 00:27:01,153
Drunk on sugary juice...

393
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,356
I'll drive away on this
delicate trip ...

394
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:05,892
Like a woman .

395
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,228
I like it.

396
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:10,529
Thanks.

397
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:15,167
Cool place, that's Mookie's,
huh?

398
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,605
Yep.

399
00:27:19,672 --> 00:27:22,074
The narrator isn't Calista,
is it?

400
00:27:25,611 --> 00:27:26,746
No.

401
00:27:26,813 --> 00:27:27,914
Yeah, I thought so.

00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,698
And it's a beautiful thing,
isn't it?

405
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,188
Come on.

406
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:10,456
Where are we going?

407
00:28:11,758 --> 00:28:12,825
The fence.

408
00:28:12,892 --> 00:28:13,893
The what?

409
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:15,962
The electric fence.

410
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,263
What's that?

411
00:28:18,898 --> 00:28:20,399
I'll show you.

412
00:28:25,905 --> 00:28:29,175
-People come out here
to be healed.
-What do you mean?

413
00:28:29,241 --> 00:28:32,244
People with all sorts
of ailments come out here.

414
00:28:32,311 --> 00:28:34,847
You know,
like arthritis and stuff.

415
00:28:34,914 --> 00:28:37,249
And they grab onto the fence
for as long as possible

416
00:28:37,316 --> 00:28:39,151
because the currents
will heal them.

417
00:28:43,422 --> 00:28:46,358
I've never been here alone.

418
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:48,961
I mean, without Audrey.

419
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,698
Does it work?

420
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:54,733
Of course.

I got a story in here.

00:29:41,047 --> 00:29:43,115
About these kids that invented
this shrinking formula...

426
00:29:43,182 --> 00:29:47,319
And then they form this
utopian society inside
Jerry Garcia's beard.

427
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,521
Pretty cool.

433

Hey, do I have any puke

No.

You don't have any puke

Yeah, good,

437
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,388
because...

438
00:30:22,454 --> 00:30:24,423
That would kind of suck.

439
00:30:28,895 --> 00:30:31,163
Listen, can I ask your advice?

440
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:34,033
Calista showed me something
this morning...

441
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,168
I kind of want to do
something special for her.

442
00:30:36,235 --> 00:30:40,506
Do you think you can help me
think of something
really special?

443
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:44,010
-Yeah. I'll think of
something.
-Cool. Thank you.

444
00:30:49,048 --> 00:30:52,284
She really likes
barbeque sauce on her
French fries.

And don't forget
the berry blast,
that's her favourite dessert.

446
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,923
That's sweet.
She's gonna love that.

447
00:30:56,989 --> 00:30:59,458
Thank you. You, you're sweet.

448
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:02,294
Yeah. Whatever.

00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,438
Seriously?

453
00:31:12,504 --> 00:31:14,206
I have a boy toy.

454
00:31:14,273 --> 00:31:16,608
What? You have a boy toy?

455
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:17,743
Yeah.
That dude?

456

No, he's a sweetheart.

Listen, I was talking
to Calista the other day,

460
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,628
and she was telling me all
the stuff you do for her.

461
00:31:36,695 --> 00:31:40,832
How she'd lie in bed all day
if it weren't for you.

462
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:44,670
And I just think
that's pretty amazing what
you do for her.

463
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,139
Yeah, well, she's my
best friend.

464
00:31:47,673 --> 00:31:48,774
Yeah.

465
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,845
What's going to happen
when you go away?

466
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:57,249
I'm not going anywhere.

467
00:31:57,316 --> 00:32:00,319
No, I mean when you go
to college or whatever.

468
00:32:01,687 --> 00:32:03,522
I'm not going anywhere.

469
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:05,857
Calista says
you're like a genius,
so I just thought...

470
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:09,561
Well, I'm not a genius and
I don't need a degree
or anything.

471
00:32:09,628 --> 00:32:12,831
I want to be a writer.
Emily Dickinson is one
of the greatest poets ever

472
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:14,633
and she never went to college.

473
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:17,836
She never left her room.

474
00:32:17,903 --> 00:32:19,005
Okay.

475
00:32:20,172 --> 00:32:21,340
Sorry.

and beyond...

00:32:31,483 --> 00:32:33,585
I water the dream garden...

478
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:36,755
But wither in the bone
dry soil...

479

a fairy tale...

Oh, and barbecue sauce.

in a long while.

Was that the wrong answer?

No.

That's the right answer.

I hope it's ready
in two weeks.

500

How about you?
How, how you been feeling?

501
00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:05,977
I'm good.
I mean, I have bad days.

But I have more good days
than bad days for now.

I think you're brave.

I think you feel sorry for me.

No... I... I'm just...

506
00:34:20,926 --> 00:34:22,994
It's just kind of scary,
you know.

507
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,131
It's like this story
I once read about this guy

508
00:34:25,197 --> 00:34:28,434
who was playing a pick-up game
with Larry Bird...

509
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,336
And Larry Bird jammed
his finger.

510
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,704
And he asked the guy
to pull it out.

511
00:34:32,771 --> 00:34:35,073
The guy was just afraid
to do it, you know,

512
00:34:35,141 --> 00:34:38,310
'cause he like...
What if he messed up and...

513
00:34:38,377 --> 00:34:42,714
Did more damage to one of
the best fingers to ever touch
a basketball.

514
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:46,452
So I guess I just don't know
how I'd react if...

515
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:49,455
You ask me to pull your finger
out for you.

516
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:51,523
Does that make any sense?

517
00:34:53,892 --> 00:34:54,960
Yes.

I don't know about that,
but...

were just singing...

I haven't heard
anything like that,
even on the radio.

She's done it all, Audrey.

534
00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:25,210
She played bass
in a real romper stomper

and beer punk band.

536

And then after that...

537
00:37:29,415 --> 00:37:31,950
After that,
she had a couple of
really big hits in Finland...

538
00:37:32,017 --> 00:37:34,586
with a band called Horse.

I don't know.
Yeah, he gets silly.

540
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,056
And then she broke about
a million hearts

541
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:40,191
with her folks songs and
her guitar.

00:37:57,343 --> 00:37:58,777
She could only play
if she got really loaded,

550
00:37:58,844 --> 00:38:01,947
so, she says she'll only play
for me and Herb from now on.

who writes really cool poems,

Can I read some of your poems
sometime?

I don't know.
I, don't really like

566
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:44,390
to let people read them until
they're ready.

567

How do you know they're
really ready unless

568
00:38:46,525 --> 00:38:48,494
you let people read them?

But we're this pattern moving
through space.

641
00:43:25,303 --> 00:43:27,639
We are time moving
through time,
that's all we are.

642
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:34,479
It's a pattern,
it's just a pattern.

643
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:36,481
It's like a coil on top
of itself...

644
00:43:36,547 --> 00:43:38,616
Like a slinky.
And that's all we are.

647

What time is it?

648
00:43:45,657 --> 00:43:47,693
There is no time.
That's what I'm saying.

649
00:43:47,759 --> 00:43:51,029
You know, you and I,
we are time, that's it.

650
00:43:53,198 --> 00:43:54,565
Calista...

651
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:58,603
Calista is time. Everything
you know, that's time.

652
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:02,207

are time, animals are time.

653
00:44:02,273 --> 00:44:04,142

654

655
00:44:26,965 --> 00:44:28,366
I know. I screwed up.

656
00:44:31,302 --> 00:44:34,039
She was really scared.
She had killer spasms today.

657
00:44:34,105 --> 00:44:36,274
And when she found out
you weren't around,

658
00:44:36,341 --> 00:44:38,009
she just kind of freaked.

659
00:44:38,076 --> 00:44:39,978
And it got worse.

660
00:44:40,045 --> 00:44:42,948
I didn't mean to.
I just got lost.

661

Mookie's leaving.

662
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:51,356
He's too good for Dreamland.

663
00:44:52,991 --> 00:44:55,727
He's going to go somewhere
far, far away.

664
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:00,866
I just, I feel it
all unraveling, you know?

665
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,169
I know how it feels.

666
00:45:07,072 --> 00:45:08,306
I don't.

667
00:45:10,776 --> 00:45:13,178
You and Calista have always
been the unravelers.

668
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:17,048
I'm a raveler, you know?

669
00:45:17,115 --> 00:45:18,750
You have raveled.

670
00:45:21,953 --> 00:45:24,089
I just don't wanna face her.

671
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:27,993
I don't want to deal with
her all...

672
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:29,394

673
00:45:30,328 --> 00:45:31,429
Yeah.

674
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,367

675
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:41,506
Baby, you're asking advice
from a guy

676
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:44,742

of a trailer park
in two years.

677
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:48,646
I'm no good at raveling.

678
00:45:56,054 --> 00:45:57,388
Will you miss me?

679
00:45:57,455 --> 00:45:58,723
Of course I will miss you.

680
00:45:59,624 --> 00:46:00,892
How much?

681
00:46:04,529 --> 00:46:06,231
This much.

682
00:46:06,297 --> 00:46:08,299
No, you won't.

683
00:46:08,366 --> 00:46:12,370
-You're going to forget all
about me.
-What are you talking about?

684
00:46:12,437 --> 00:46:15,941
One week away
from Dreamland...

685
00:46:16,007 --> 00:46:18,143
You're just gonna
hook-up with some
basketball groupie

686
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:20,745
and forget all about
your sickly girlfriend.

687
00:46:20,812 --> 00:46:22,814
I won't forget about you.

688
00:46:29,054 --> 00:46:30,822
I'm sorry.

689
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:32,423
Don't sweat it.

690
00:46:33,658 --> 00:46:35,326
Well, you know.
How'd it go?

691
00:46:35,393 --> 00:46:38,830
I still tune out all that
medical mumble-jumbo...

692
00:46:38,897 --> 00:46:40,832
So I guess I don't really know
for sure...

But, he had a nice smile.

694
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,503
Not too comforting
or anything, so,

695
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:47,472
I guess that's good, right?

696
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:48,907
I was selfish, I'm sorry.

697
00:46:48,974 --> 00:46:51,176
I said don't sweat it, okay?

698
00:46:51,242 --> 00:46:52,610
Thank you, Mookie
for stepping in.

699
00:46:52,677 --> 00:46:55,613
Come on, Mookie, we only have
one more night.

700
00:47:46,932 --> 00:47:47,999
Hey.

701
00:47:51,169 --> 00:47:52,670
I like this spot.

702
00:47:52,737 --> 00:47:54,205
How did you find it?

703
00:47:56,341 --> 00:47:58,309
It's a really nice spot.

704
00:47:59,277 --> 00:48:01,379
Have you been spying on me?

705
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:06,617
Maybe. Metaphysically, maybe.

706
00:48:06,684 --> 00:48:09,054
I guess it's kind
of impossible to keep secrets

707
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,821

708
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,557
You'd be surprised.

709
00:48:14,993 --> 00:48:17,462
It is nice though, isn't it?
Isn't it cool?

710
00:48:17,528 --> 00:48:18,930
Herb helped me build it.

711
00:48:18,997 --> 00:48:20,031
Herb's awesome.

712
00:48:20,098 --> 00:48:21,066
Yeah, he is.

713
00:48:23,268 --> 00:48:26,237
He's gonna be my official Dad.
How about that?

714
00:48:26,304 --> 00:48:28,073
He and Mom are getting married
tomorrow night.

715
00:48:28,139 --> 00:48:30,575
Well, tonight, I guess,
when we get to Vegas.

716
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:31,642
For real?

717
00:48:31,709 --> 00:48:33,979
They're going all out too.

718
00:48:34,045 --> 00:48:37,748
We're staying at some place
called the American Motel.

719
00:48:37,815 --> 00:48:41,519
Because I guess that's where
Mom was when she wrote
Herb's favourite song.

720
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:45,890

sad girl and then it ends.

Good, then let me read it.

00:58:38,015 --> 00:58:39,349
That's your wedding ring.

802
00:58:40,918 --> 00:58:43,053
Yeah.

803
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:46,657
That's so great.
Um, congratulations.

804
00:58:48,192 --> 00:58:50,928
This is your wedding night
I'm interrupting.

805
00:58:50,995 --> 00:58:52,029
I'm so sorry.

806
00:58:52,096 --> 00:58:53,430
I'm looking for Mookie.

807
00:58:54,164 --> 00:58:55,199
He went back.

808
00:58:56,601 --> 00:58:57,802
He went back where?

809
00:58:59,103 --> 00:59:00,337
To be with Calista.

810
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:04,742
(SIGHS)
You don't know.

811
00:59:06,811 --> 00:59:08,045
There's been an accident.

812
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:11,315
Calista's been in an accident.

813
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:14,418
Come on, you'll stay with us
tonight. We'll go back
tomorrow. It's okay.

814
00:59:31,702 --> 00:59:34,071
HENRY:
How is she?
What are they saying?

815
00:59:34,138 --> 00:59:35,840
Is she going to be all right?

816
00:59:35,906 --> 00:59:37,675
AUNT SADIE:
I don't know.
She's been hurt pretty bad.

817
00:59:37,742 --> 00:59:40,577
She's going to be here for
at least a couple of weeks.

818
00:59:40,645 --> 00:59:44,448
They're still running scans
in her neck and
she's in a lot of pain.

819
00:59:45,149 --> 00:59:46,917
Goddamn.

820
00:59:46,984 --> 00:59:49,053
Henry, Audrey's really got to
get down here.

821
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,554
Have you found her yet?

822
00:59:50,621 --> 00:59:52,556
She's not going to be back
till tomorrow night.

823
00:59:52,623 --> 00:59:54,091
Can you come down here then?

824
00:59:54,158 --> 00:59:56,861
I have to get back
to the plant.
I can't leave her alone.

825
00:59:57,695 --> 00:59:59,229
Come on, Henry, please?

826
00:59:59,296 --> 01:00:00,798
No, I, I can't.

827
01:00:00,865 --> 01:00:01,966
Why not?

828
01:00:02,633 --> 01:00:04,534
Because I just, I can't.

829
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:07,838
-There's nobody else
I can call on, Henry.
-I'm sorry, okay?

830
01:00:07,905 --> 01:00:09,173
Calista needs you now...

833
01:01:49,673 --> 01:01:51,241
Hey, baby.
Henry?

834
01:01:51,909 --> 01:01:52,910
How you doing?

835
01:01:54,478 --> 01:01:56,046
I'm so glad you're here.

836
01:02:07,024 --> 01:02:08,926
Juanita dumped Mauricio.

837
01:02:12,529 --> 01:02:14,698
Well, now, that sucks.

838
01:02:14,765 --> 01:02:17,234
No, it doesn't. It's cool.

839
01:02:17,301 --> 01:02:19,970
You know,
'cause she did it for him.

840
01:02:20,037 --> 01:02:22,506
'Cause she knows that
he really loves Rosa.

841
01:02:23,373 --> 01:02:25,009
You know, it was sad.

842
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:26,944
But it was really
beautiful too,

843
01:02:27,011 --> 01:02:28,879
because she loves him so much.

844
01:02:31,715 --> 01:02:33,050
What can I do for you, baby?

845

Give me the pill...

846
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:45,629
That's good stuff.

847
01:02:47,998 --> 01:02:50,000
Easy. Open up. Easy.

848
01:02:50,634 --> 01:02:51,735
Okay.

849
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:55,272
All right, just don't
move now.

850
01:02:55,339 --> 01:02:56,807
Oh, shit. My bad.

851
01:03:00,277 --> 01:03:02,212
There you go. It's all right.

852
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:05,315
I guess what I have to
look forward to...

853
01:03:05,382 --> 01:03:07,617
Sad people wiping drool
off my chin.

854
01:03:11,021 --> 01:03:13,423
You're going to...

855
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:15,392
You're going to be all right.
You'll recover.

856
01:03:16,326 --> 01:03:17,394
You didn't.

857
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:21,665
You lost your lover
and you never recovered.

858

And mine just stopped
loving me.

(SOBBING)

863
01:04:57,261 --> 01:04:58,895
I was going after you.

864
01:04:59,997 --> 01:05:01,465
That's what I was doing.

865
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,768
I know.

866
01:05:04,834 --> 01:05:07,537
I was going to seduce you.

867
01:05:07,604 --> 01:05:12,009
I was going to be
weepy and sexy,
and seduce you.

868
01:05:14,211 --> 01:05:16,846
And I was even maybe going to
let you get me pregnant...

869
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:20,517
and I didn't care if that
made me ineligible for
Miss America.

870
01:05:23,387 --> 01:05:25,255
I don't...

871
01:05:25,322 --> 01:05:27,724
I don't want to lie to you.
I don't know what's going on.

872
01:05:31,228 --> 01:05:35,465
It's like I'm handling
the ball on a fast break,
you know...

873
01:05:35,532 --> 01:05:38,969
And all I got to do is
pull up and just take
a little jump shot and...

874
01:05:39,036 --> 01:05:43,640
Hey, Mookie,
I'm just a little too doped up
right now for basketball talk.

875
01:05:44,808 --> 01:05:46,510
Can you just be here?

876
01:05:47,244 --> 01:05:48,245
Just be here.

877
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:49,946
Yeah.

878
01:06:13,703 --> 01:06:15,039
Hey. Hi. Hi.

879
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:22,979
How is she?

880
01:06:24,214 --> 01:06:25,449
She's all right.

881
01:06:25,515 --> 01:06:27,117
I mean, you know,
she'll be okay.

882
01:06:28,685 --> 01:06:29,953
Can I see her?

883
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:31,988
She doesn't want
to see you right now...

884
01:06:32,556 --> 01:06:34,158
So, no, not now.

885
01:06:37,561 --> 01:06:39,963
Has she been here
alone all night?

886
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:42,132
No. Henry came by.

887
01:06:42,199 --> 01:06:44,534
-He was here for
a little while.
-My Dad was here?

888
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,712
What are you doing?
What is this?

889
01:06:56,613 --> 01:06:57,914
Why don't you tell me, baby?

890
01:06:57,981 --> 01:07:00,317
How can you ask me that?
What kind of question is that?

891
01:07:00,384 --> 01:07:02,552
These big ones,
they mean that you got in.
Do you know that?

892
01:07:02,619 --> 01:07:04,121
Yes, I know that.

893
01:07:05,155 --> 01:07:06,390
Let's talk about it.

894
01:07:06,456 --> 01:07:08,225
No.
You had no right to do this.

895
01:07:08,292 --> 01:07:10,294
Okay, you're right.
I didn't, but now I know.

896
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:12,462
Look, smoke another fatty
and forget about it.

897
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:13,630
Hey, baby...

898
01:07:13,697 --> 01:07:15,732
I really don't want to
hear this right now!

899
01:07:15,799 --> 01:07:18,135
Well, you're going to hear it.
I'm proud of you.

900
01:07:18,202 --> 01:07:20,304
I want to help you do
whatever you got to do.

901
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:22,272
I want you to leave me alone.

902
01:07:23,006 --> 01:07:24,408
What?
Audrey!

903
01:07:24,474 --> 01:07:26,576
Okay, come on,
let's hear it, Dad.

904
01:07:26,643 --> 01:07:28,312
Let's hear the
I'm-your-father speech

905
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:30,046
you've been rehearsing
for three years.

906
01:07:30,114 --> 01:07:31,981
How can you do this
to me right now?

907
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:35,452
Doing what? I'm
trying to help you figure out
what you want to do.

908
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:38,622
Maybe what I want to do
is just stay in
Dreamland forever,

909
01:07:38,688 --> 01:07:42,226
nursing your hangovers and
peddling cigarettes
at the convenience store.

910
01:07:42,292 --> 01:07:45,662
Maybe I want to drink this
beer and sit in the hot tub.
Maybe that's what I want.

911
01:07:45,729 --> 01:07:49,533
You deserve so much
more than that, baby.

912
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:52,402
Maybe I should have
crashed a motorcycle
a long time ago.

(SOBBING)

914
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:54,798
You okay?

915
01:08:56,099 --> 01:08:57,901
Uh...

916
01:09:02,071 --> 01:09:03,240
What's the matter?

917
01:09:03,307 --> 01:09:04,441
I couldn't sleep, so,

918
01:09:05,209 --> 01:09:06,943
I was watching Baywatch.

919
01:09:07,010 --> 01:09:09,145
These two kids,
they were drowning.

920
01:09:09,213 --> 01:09:12,616
And David Hasselhoff could
only save one of them.

921
01:09:12,682 --> 01:09:16,019
So then David Hasselhoff
had to go tell
the dead kid's dad

922
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:18,087
that his kid was dead.

923
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:22,192
And then, I don't know,
during this like,
huge emotional scene...

924
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:25,495
David Hasselhoff was like
sucking his stomach in
the whole time.

925
01:09:28,732 --> 01:09:31,067
And, I don't know,
it really made me sad.

926
01:09:32,936 --> 01:09:35,872
I must be losing it.

927
01:09:35,939 --> 01:09:38,775
You know there's
a fine line between
losing it and getting it.

928
01:09:40,644 --> 01:09:42,712
What's that supposed to mean?

929
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:44,714
-I don't know,
I just made it up.
-(LAUGHS)

930
01:09:46,316 --> 01:09:48,218
Thanks for spending
the nights with me.

931
01:09:48,285 --> 01:09:51,455
That's really, really
helped me feel better,
so, thank you.

932
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:52,522
Good.

933
01:09:56,460 --> 01:09:58,027

wants to come visit.

934
01:10:01,398 --> 01:10:03,933
Maybe later, but, not now.

935
01:10:06,403 --> 01:10:07,404
Okay.

936
01:10:14,077 --> 01:10:15,078
How does that feel?

937
01:10:16,112 --> 01:10:17,547
Does it hurt?

938
01:10:17,614 --> 01:10:19,516
No. That feels wonderful.

939
01:10:20,784 --> 01:10:22,352
We need to talk about us.

940
01:10:26,356 --> 01:10:28,258
I want you to know that I...

941
01:10:28,325 --> 01:10:30,560
That I really care about you.

942
01:10:30,627 --> 01:10:32,796
And that I think you're
an amazing person.

943
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:34,631
You are too.

944
01:10:37,267 --> 01:10:39,969
And that I will always
care about you.

945
01:10:41,905 --> 01:10:44,841
You know? But you're leaving.

946
01:10:44,908 --> 01:10:47,311
So I just don't...

947
01:10:48,945 --> 01:10:51,381
I just don't know.

948
01:10:51,448 --> 01:10:54,651
I think we should just
be friends, Mookie.

949
01:10:54,718 --> 01:10:55,752
Yeah.

950
01:10:57,654 --> 01:10:59,022
No, please don't stop.

951
01:11:00,424 --> 01:11:02,058
Please don't stop.

01:11:03,293 --> 01:11:04,794

01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:22,546
Morning, baby.

What?

You. You look great.

Thanks. I feel good.

Not getting as many headaches
and, you know...

01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:46,870
I didn't realize how shallow
my breathing had gotten.

960
01:11:48,405 --> 01:11:50,474
The type of thing I stopped
noticing.

961
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,141
How about you?

962
01:11:53,943 --> 01:11:56,179
I just want to see her.

963
01:11:56,245 --> 01:11:57,814
She's getting better every
day, she really is.

964
01:11:57,881 --> 01:11:59,849
She's not though.

965
01:11:59,916 --> 01:12:03,420
I mean, she's going to
recover from this but she's
never going to be okay.

966
01:12:03,487 --> 01:12:05,822
Her neurons are going
to keep getting attacked
and...

967
01:12:05,889 --> 01:12:07,791
They're eventually just going
to break down.

968
01:12:07,857 --> 01:12:10,794
And she's going to get weak
and tired and that's just the
way it is.

969
01:12:15,264 --> 01:12:16,299
Well, you never know.

970
01:12:22,939 --> 01:12:25,008
(PHONE RINGING)

971
01:12:32,516 --> 01:12:33,517
Hello?

972
01:12:34,518 --> 01:12:35,519
CALISTA: Hey.

973
01:12:36,586 --> 01:12:38,622
Calista?

974
01:12:38,688 --> 01:12:41,958
Hi, um, I was just wondering
what you were doing
the day after tomorrow?

975
01:12:44,594 --> 01:12:47,030
I don't... I don't know. Why?

976
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:49,232
I'm coming home.

977
01:12:50,867 --> 01:12:53,503
I'm... That's great.

978
01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:56,706
So if, you know, if you're
not doing anything...
I mean if you're around,

979
01:12:56,773 --> 01:13:00,410
I just thought, you know,
you could just be there
when I get back.

980
01:13:01,511 --> 01:13:02,512
Of course.

981
01:13:03,947 --> 01:13:05,815
I've missed you.

982
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:09,052
Well, um, I'll see you in
a couple days, okay?

983
01:13:09,118 --> 01:13:10,420
Okay.

984
01:13:10,487 --> 01:13:12,756
Splendid. Goodnight, crazy.

985
01:13:12,822 --> 01:13:13,823
Goodnight.

986
01:13:16,693 --> 01:13:17,694
(PHONE BEEPS)

987
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:45,121
Hey.

988
01:13:45,955 --> 01:13:47,190
Hey.

989
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:48,892
Dreamer said you'd
be out here.

990
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:49,959
I was just leaving.

991
01:13:51,027 --> 01:13:52,328
Come on.
I'll walk back with you.

992
01:13:53,563 --> 01:13:54,898
Did Calista call you?

993
01:13:54,964 --> 01:13:56,332
Did she tell you she's
coming back?

994
01:13:56,399 --> 01:13:57,767
Uh, yeah.

995
01:13:57,834 --> 01:14:00,770
I talked to her yesterday and
she said she's coming home.

996
01:14:00,837 --> 01:14:02,706
Yeah.

997
01:14:02,772 --> 01:14:03,773
Did she tell you she broke
up with me?

998
01:14:04,708 --> 01:14:05,709
She broke up with you?

999
01:14:07,343 --> 01:14:08,812
Yeah.

1000
01:14:08,878 --> 01:14:10,980
It's okay, we both knew
it wasn't going to work.

1001
01:14:13,082 --> 01:14:14,651
Why not?

1002
01:14:14,718 --> 01:14:15,719
You know why not.

1003
01:14:18,855 --> 01:14:20,724
I can't stop thinking
about you.

1004
01:14:22,492 --> 01:14:24,193
Calista is my best friend.

1005
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:27,497
I know, but this isn't
about Calista, Audrey,
this is about you.

1006
01:14:27,564 --> 01:14:28,565
Why are you doing this?

1007
01:14:30,333 --> 01:14:34,103
Because I couldn't leave
without telling you how
I feel.

1008
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:37,641
It doesn't matter anyway,
because you're leaving
and I'm going to be here.

1009
01:14:37,707 --> 01:14:40,777
You can't stay here forever
taking care of other people.

1010
01:14:40,844 --> 01:14:42,478
So what do you want
me to do?

1011
01:14:42,546 --> 01:14:44,447
Abandon them?

1012
01:14:44,514 --> 01:14:46,983
For what? So I can sit in
a classroom and talk
about poems?

1013
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:48,184
They need me.

1014
01:14:48,251 --> 01:14:50,119
They love you more than
they need you.

1015
01:14:50,186 --> 01:14:51,855
You don't know anything.

1016
01:14:51,921 --> 01:14:52,922
I know you want more
than this.

1017
01:15:30,393 --> 01:15:31,828
Let me take care of you.

1018
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:27,016
I'm so proud of you, baby.

1019
01:16:27,884 --> 01:16:28,885
I'm proud of you too.

1020
01:16:29,853 --> 01:16:31,855
Tell me all about it.

1021
01:16:31,921 --> 01:16:34,624
Well, I'm going to be
in customer relations in

1022
01:16:34,691 --> 01:16:37,060
the product distribution
division.

1023
01:16:37,126 --> 01:16:38,494
Hey, they gave me a company
car.

1024
01:16:38,561 --> 01:16:41,197
Yeah.
Smooth.

1025
01:16:41,264 --> 01:16:44,200
It's just going to keep
getting better and better,
you know that?

1026
01:16:44,267 --> 01:16:46,903
You'll be Miss America
one day. I know it.

1027
01:16:46,970 --> 01:16:48,171
You know, I don't know.

1028
01:16:50,039 --> 01:16:52,308
I don't know if I want
to be Miss America
anymore.

1029
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:55,712
How about Miss Dreamland?

1030
01:16:57,914 --> 01:16:58,915
It's got a nice ring to it.

1031
01:17:00,684 --> 01:17:01,685
Hmm.

1032
01:17:15,031 --> 01:17:16,032
(CAR DOOR CLOSING)

1033
01:18:04,247 --> 01:18:05,248
Hello.

1034
01:18:07,817 --> 01:18:12,421
That first night when
I was in the hospital...

1035
01:18:12,488 --> 01:18:17,326
I had this moment.
I had woken up in
the middle of the night...

1036
01:18:17,393 --> 01:18:22,265
And Mookie was there,
and he was asleep,
and I didn't...

1037
01:18:22,331 --> 01:18:24,367
I didn't believe it at first.

1038
01:18:24,433 --> 01:18:26,702
You know, and then I looked
at him, and he was just

1039
01:18:26,770 --> 01:18:29,906
so cute, and kind,
and, um...

1040
01:18:30,974 --> 01:18:32,375
Kind of like an angel.

1041
01:18:33,376 --> 01:18:34,844
And that's when I knew it.

1042
01:18:36,179 --> 01:18:37,180
What?

1043
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:40,449
That it was over.

1044
01:18:40,516 --> 01:18:43,219
I mean, not like over, but
that it was over between us.

1045
01:18:44,921 --> 01:18:45,922
Like, I...

1046
01:18:47,423 --> 01:18:49,926
I didn't want him there.

1047
01:18:49,993 --> 01:18:54,764
Like I didn't want him at my
bedside dreaming about me.

1048
01:18:54,831 --> 01:18:55,832
Not like that.

1049
01:18:56,966 --> 01:18:58,835
Yeah, but that's weird, huh?

1050
01:18:58,902 --> 01:19:00,069
'Cause I always want
people dreaming about me.

1051
01:19:00,136 --> 01:19:01,504
(BOTH LAUGH)

1052
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:03,172
Of course.

1053
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:06,142
I tried to close my eyes
and make it go away,

1054
01:19:06,209 --> 01:19:08,311
like that feeling,
and I couldn't.

1055
01:19:08,377 --> 01:19:10,479
It just kept getting bigger.

1056
01:19:10,546 --> 01:19:14,350
And all those other things,
like those other feelings
of love,

1057
01:19:14,417 --> 01:19:15,985
they just kind of faded out.

1058
01:19:17,921 --> 01:19:19,455
And I wasn't afraid anymore.

1059
01:19:22,826 --> 01:19:23,827
You know what I mean?

1060
01:19:29,098 --> 01:19:30,099
I don't know.

1061
01:19:31,167 --> 01:19:32,168
But...

1062
01:19:33,669 --> 01:19:36,505
I know that you're beautiful.

1063
01:19:36,572 --> 01:19:40,810
And that I'll never, ever,
ever meet anyone else
like you

1064
01:19:40,877 --> 01:19:42,011
for the rest of my life.

1065
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:48,451
I have candy.

1066
01:19:50,586 --> 01:19:51,821
Do you want some.

1067
01:19:51,888 --> 01:19:52,889
Sure.

1068
01:19:54,891 --> 01:19:55,892
All right.

1069
01:19:57,961 --> 01:20:00,696
Uh, pick one.
Not that one.

1070
01:20:18,047 --> 01:20:19,048
I love this one.

1071
01:20:20,884 --> 01:20:22,351
Check out the look on her
face.

1072
01:20:25,721 --> 01:20:26,722
She's lovely.

1073
01:20:28,757 --> 01:20:31,627
Yeah, she was always lovely,

1074
01:20:31,694 --> 01:20:34,363
but right here she looks like
she's going to take
on the world, huh?

1075
01:20:43,706 --> 01:20:45,141
Have you come to a decision?

1076
01:20:49,278 --> 01:20:50,279
Yeah.

1077
01:20:53,249 --> 01:20:54,250
I'm going.

1078
01:21:06,930 --> 01:21:07,931
Mmm-hmm.

1079
01:22:20,836 --> 01:22:23,306
All right. Packed and
ready to go.

1080
01:22:23,706 --> 01:22:24,707
Thanks.

1081
01:22:25,541 --> 01:22:26,542
You're all set.

1082
01:22:28,544 --> 01:22:29,979
I'm going to miss you.

1083
01:22:30,046 --> 01:22:31,047
I'll miss you too.

1084
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:19,928
Really?

1085
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:20,996
Yeah.

1086
01:23:21,797 --> 01:23:22,798
Yeah?

1087
01:23:25,901 --> 01:23:29,905
The blanket of smoke
and candy lies crumpled
on the bed...

1088
01:23:29,972 --> 01:23:33,542
Drenched in perfume,
unraveled by desire...

1089
01:23:33,609 --> 01:23:36,412
But strong as spider silk...

1090
01:23:36,479 --> 01:23:39,115
It falls away while
I stretch...

1091
01:23:39,182 --> 01:23:41,617
Brush the diamonds from
my eyes and wake up.

1092
01:23:45,121 --> 01:23:47,022
(INAUDIBLE)

1093
01:23:49,158 --> 01:23:50,159
(BUZZING)

1094
01:24:14,917 --> 01:24:15,851
That's beautiful.
