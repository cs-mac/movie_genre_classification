1
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:21,420
<i>Is this our new house?</i>

2
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:25,324
<i>No, this isn't our new house, bud, this
belongs to one of Mommy's yoga clients.</i>

3
00:00:25,326 --> 00:00:27,259
<i>Yeah, we couldn't</i>
<i>afford this house,</i>

4
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:29,361
<i>- but we're happy to stay here.</i>
- <i> Tim... Tim...</i>

5
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:30,829
<i>This is like a nice</i>
<i>hotel house.</i>

6
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:34,199
- <i> Are you gonna be a D-O-U-C-H-E?
- </i> -<i> No, no, no.</i>

7
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:35,868
<i>Okay, good.</i>

8
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:39,004
<i>It's gonna be a really super
fun vacation for our family.</i>

9
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:40,873
- <i> Oh!</i>
- -<i> Yeah!</i>

10
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:42,274
- <i> Are you excited?</i>
- -<i> Yeah.</i>

11
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:44,576
All right, Jude, it's time.

12
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:47,825
He's going first, for sure.

13
00:00:50,016 --> 00:00:51,417
Okay, thank you.

14
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:55,587
- All right.

15
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:58,057
Guys, swimming pool.

16
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:04,463
- Good, right?
- Yeah, it's great.

17
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:09,034
- I'm really glad we're doing this.
- Me too.

18
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:10,702
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

19
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:13,806
- It's gonna be fun.
- We'll build a fire.

20
00:01:13,808 --> 00:01:15,140
What do you think, buddy?

21
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:16,475
Good.

22
00:01:20,113 --> 00:01:21,513
- Fun.
- Yeah.

23
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:28,320
For me now, okay? Perfect.

24
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:32,491
Oh, yeah. That's called Child's Pose.
You can put your head down right there.

25
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:36,662
That's a resting pose. Yeah.

26
00:01:36,664 --> 00:01:40,499
It's like a really, really
sweet resting pose.

27
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:45,771
Okay, and then you're gonna
come up on your hands.

28
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:48,907
Up. Stay there.
Now we're gonna pretend...

29
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:52,544
We're gonna come up a little bit,
come up where you just were.

30
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:56,448
Right here. Okay, now we're
gonna pretend we're a cow.

31
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,217
- We're gonna go like this.
- Okay.

32
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:59,985
- We go like this.
- A cow.

33
00:01:59,987 --> 00:02:02,154
A cow. And we're gonna
kind of arch our...

34
00:02:02,156 --> 00:02:03,856
Yeah, that's perfect, buddy.

35
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:06,658
And then we're gonna pretend
we're a cat and go like this.

36
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:25,144
Left leg,
which is your left leg?

37
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:27,479
This one.

38
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,349
This one? This one's your right leg.
This one's your left leg.

39
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:33,152
Okay, you're gonna fold
this one in right here,

40
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:36,822
and now you're gonna bend over your left
leg and touch your toes with your fingers.

41
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,024
Can you do that one?

42
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,601
<i>You're gonna straighten</i>
<i>your legs,</i>

43
00:02:49,603 --> 00:02:53,338
and you're gonna touch your toes like this.
Can you do it like that?

44
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,340
Yeah.

45
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,876
- Wow, you sure can, and then you're
gonna fold your head right over there.

46
00:02:57,878 --> 00:02:59,638
God bless you, God bless you.

47
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,781
Gesundheit.

48
00:03:02,783 --> 00:03:06,424
We're gonna go like this, and you're gonna put
your head down for a second, like, down here.

49
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:08,153
- <i> How does that feel?</i>
- -<i> Good.</i>

50
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:10,989
<i>It feels good?
Do you feel like a nice stretch in here?</i>

51
00:03:32,279 --> 00:03:34,246
Here, you want some of this?

52
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:46,191
Hey, Lee, look what I
found on the hill.

53
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:49,761
So I was just digging around here, I
wanted to see where that sprinkler went,

54
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,363
and I started kicking
around and I found this.

55
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:52,798
- Can I touch it?
- Yes.

56
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,800
And then this bone, Lee,
was, like, back in the hill.

57
00:03:54,802 --> 00:03:57,502
That's a bone? Let me see that.
I wanna touch that.

58
00:03:57,504 --> 00:03:58,704
I feel like we gotta
know whatever...

59
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:01,173
I mean, are you trying
to think like "pow pow"?

60
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:02,808
- Mom?
- -Yes.

61
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:07,946
I think at some point, somebody put this...
And if we go deep in here...

62
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:09,514
Oh, God. No, no, no.

63
00:04:09,516 --> 00:04:12,451
And I feel like we should
probably find out what it is.

64
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:13,552
Why?

65
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:23,061
See, now you know what happens to my brain, because
now my brain thinks there's like 20 bodies...

66
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:25,097
There could be.

67
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:28,033
- There absolutely could be.
- -It's my skin.

68
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:31,436
All right. Okay.

69
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:36,675
Great. So if I find it myself
then I'll call, for sure.

70
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:39,811
It's ridiculous. Absolutely.

71
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:43,382
Okay, thank you.
Yeah, goodbye. Thank you.

72
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,286
That was a joke.

73
00:04:47,288 --> 00:04:52,190
Uh, the L.A.P.D. just said that it's not
their job to dig out somebody else's trash,

74
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:54,626
and to call
if we find the body,

75
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,495
but in the meantime, there's
nothing they could do.

76
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:58,897
And she had a tone with me, like
I was doing something wrong.

77
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,833
Good.

78
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:05,037
And I told her about the gun and
I told her about the bone, so...

79
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,571
So, what are you gonna do?

80
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,407
I'm gonna dig out the body.

81
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:11,176
- Or I'm gonna at least get closer to that.
- No, I think we're gonna leave it.

82
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:13,011
Lee, we can't leave it.

83
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:16,214
Tim, I was just putting down Jude and
he was like, "Where's the bone?"

84
00:05:16,216 --> 00:05:17,883
Fine, we don't tell Jude.
I'm fine with that.

85
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:20,485
I told Jude, and he said, "What was
it?" And I said it was just pretend.

86
00:05:20,487 --> 00:05:23,188
- It was probably a bone from a coyote.
- So let's find out if it's pretend.

87
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,456
Why?

88
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,458
'Cause there might be
a dead body on our hill.

89
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,093
It's not our hill.

90
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:30,395
Fine, of the hill
of this person.

91
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:34,199
Of my client,
of my livelihood, my job,

92
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:37,002
And I can't have them come home after
shooting a movie in Budapest and say,

93
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,870
"Oh, guess what. And by the
way, while you're out of town,"

94
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:42,140
"my husband decided to, like,
excavate your hillside,"

95
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:45,777
"and we found remains of a body,
and we think it's conn..."

96
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:48,547
I mean, what? Connected to what?
Where is it gonna go?

97
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:51,516
Well, obviously, I don't know the end of the
mystery at the beginning of the mystery.

98
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,585
Right, if there's a mystery.

99
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:58,357
I mean, my guess is that it's an animal
bone and it just happened to be...

100
00:05:58,359 --> 00:06:01,059
- Some other animal shot it?
- Yeah.

101
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:03,729
- Come on, Lee. Come on.
- You come on.

102
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:06,631
Let's not make this a crazy drama.
Let's just enjoy this place.

103
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:08,300
Okay.

104
00:06:08,302 --> 00:06:10,302
- That was just way too easy.
- I was thinking.

105
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:12,003
No, you said, "Okay."

106
00:06:12,005 --> 00:06:14,639
And then I did see you think like,
"Okay, I'm gonna appease my wife"

107
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:17,609
- "and then I'm gonna keep digging." -No.
I won't dig.

108
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:19,531
- No more digging?
- No more digging.

109
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:23,615
Let's go enjoy this place.

110
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:29,721
And if you want
a little bit more of a stretch,

111
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,491
you could push
your foot up to the ceiling.

112
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:35,861
Nice.

113
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:41,700
Tell me if this is too much.

114
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,336
Ready? Ooh-hoo!

115
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:46,104
All right, good.
We made up a new game.

116
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:47,506
- Oh!
- Great!

117
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:51,042
You're gonna arch
your back and look up.

118
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,046
Then we're gonna
round our backs

119
00:06:55,048 --> 00:06:58,150
and kind of, like, tighten
right in here, right in here.

120
00:06:58,152 --> 00:07:03,088
No, don't get me! Don't get me, buddy!
Don't get me!

121
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:07,325
What? Aah! Full wipe-out!

122
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:09,661
<i>It's cheesy to say, but really,</i>

123
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:14,065
and people say this all the time, but they
really were, like, glowing when they came back,

124
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:15,734
- and they seemed...
- Yeah.

125
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:18,804
Maybe this is just how I feel about
Ken, but he seemed a lot nicer.

126
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:20,172
- Yeah.
- Okay.

127
00:07:20,174 --> 00:07:22,607
You know, like, they really...
It's something that it's like...

128
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:25,357
I think you owe it to
yourself to do it, you know?

129
00:07:25,383 --> 00:07:26,044
- Mmm.

130
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:27,546
Yeah, I mean, honestly...

131
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:30,048
I mean, I've always wanted
to go to India, like...

132
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,384
- literally forever.
- So do it, fucking do it.

133
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:35,287
You know, once you have kids, it's
like you can't, I just can't...

134
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:38,824
That kid came into your life,
it wasn't the other way around.

135
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:41,393
He came in to your home. Take
your kid with you, you know?

136
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:43,195
Don't let that limit you,
you know?

137
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:44,329
Ugh, yeah.

138
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:46,097
- No, it's not...
- When we have kids,

139
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:48,366
we're not, you know,
it's not gonna limit us.

140
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:50,502
- No.
- -Mm-hmm.

141
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:52,404
What time was it
when you looked at your phone?

142
00:07:52,406 --> 00:07:55,407
It was uh... 5:30.

143
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:57,809
I have to get home
and make the sweet pea dinner.

144
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,077
- Oh.
- Yeah.

145
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,712
Have a fantastic time.

146
00:08:00,714 --> 00:08:05,554
- Thank you so much for this beautiful
session today. -You guys practice.

147
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:32,711
You don't have
regular milk, do you?

148
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:35,046
Um, we have raw milk.

149
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:38,783
Do you have
regular milk, though?

150
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:45,924
Um, today we have goat's milk, uh, coconut
milk, almond milk, cashew milk, um, soy milk,

151
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:49,594
and then there's hemp and flax milk
actually in the dry goods section.

152
00:08:49,596 --> 00:08:51,630
So no just regular milk?

153
00:08:51,931 --> 00:08:53,131
Not today.

154
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:58,637
I can't believe the poopies
go in the ground.

155
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:00,872
- That's where dogs and cats go poopie,
in the ground. -Jude, Jude, Jude...

156
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:04,876
Let's have dinner. It's not nice to talk
about poopies at the dinner table, okay?

157
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,211
- Okay.
- Okay.

158
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:07,979
- But guess what.
- But I love you.

159
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:10,515
- And your daddy needs to do the
taxes this weekend... -Yeah.

160
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:14,753
Because I'm gonna have a nervous breakdown if I
eat dinner on this table like this one more time.

161
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:17,622
You got it. Hey, Jude, can I ask
you a question about the taxes?

162
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:19,558
Uh, did you take
a poopie today?

163
00:09:20,026 --> 00:09:21,860
I didn't.

164
00:09:21,862 --> 00:09:22,894
What?

165
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,530
- Tim, I'm not joking.
- Okay, yeah.

166
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:28,667
We love you so much.
You're such a good boy.

167
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:32,037
- Aw.
- All right.

168
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:34,239
- See? You make me the bad guy.
- How do I...

169
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:35,907
Because you have to do this.

170
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,325
And them I'm getting...
I'm turning into this.

171
00:09:37,351 --> 00:09:38,109
Okay, how about this?

172
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:41,680
You can go play. You can do whatever
you want, buddy boy. Is that okay?

173
00:09:41,682 --> 00:09:43,734
- I'll do the taxes. I'm sorry.
- No, but see?

174
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,716
You see what happens?

175
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:47,619
And then I'm...
And then I'm the bad guy.

176
00:09:47,621 --> 00:09:50,689
Come here. Come here.

177
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:53,058
- Just do it. This weekend.
I know. -Okay.

178
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:58,196
<i>I don't wanna take</i>

179
00:09:58,198 --> 00:10:01,166
your mom and your step-dad's
money in this moment.

180
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:05,403
And I don't think there's anything wrong with that
'cause we're talking about a three-year-old boy.

181
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:06,738
Mm-hmm.

182
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,274
If this conversation was
about college and it was...

183
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,509
- college or no college, then...
- They say, they say...

184
00:10:11,511 --> 00:10:17,215
They say, they say that preschool now is
more important in getting into college

185
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:18,950
- than, like, high school.
- Stop it. I don't...

186
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,152
- It is! They say development
is... -Who the fuck is "they"?

187
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:25,423
The experts, whatever.
All the stuff that I read.

188
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:31,930
Yeah, and then we read another thing about
preschools where, uh, the one that was all dirt

189
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:33,865
and they play in the dirt
all the time

190
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:36,201
- and they raise those turtles.
- Yeah, I read that article.

191
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:41,506
And you spend $12,000 for three months and
you need to pay for every extra activity.

192
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:43,008
And there's...

193
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,510
Yeah, but, here's the thing,
you wouldn't be paying for it.

194
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:47,879
That's the thing. That's the
thing that I'm talking about.

195
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:50,882
How about our son goes to school
in the neighborhood he lives in?

196
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:54,019
Yeah, how about
that school is a six?

197
00:10:54,887 --> 00:10:57,689
How about he's in preschool?

198
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:59,824
It's not a good preschool.

199
00:10:59,826 --> 00:11:02,794
Let them run around and figure
out problems on their own.

200
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:04,663
And so if one kid
bites another kid,

201
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:07,999
- well then, the biter hangs out
with the bitee... -Oh, stop. Stop.

202
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:12,604
And they have to figure out what they did wrong, and
they talk it out for $10,000 over three months.

203
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:16,287
You're making me mad. I'm reading this.
You're making me mad.

204
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,310
- Do you want some of this?
- No.

205
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:22,180
- "Love and Foreplay Aren't
Blind." -Yeah, right.

206
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,748
My favorite chapter.

207
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:26,351
What does that even mean?

208
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,275
Hi, Mom, it's me. Can you give
me a call when you get this?

209
00:11:50,277 --> 00:11:55,246
I, uh, was thinking about coming
down for the weekend with Jude.

210
00:11:55,248 --> 00:12:00,452
And maybe asking if you'd babysit for
me so I can have a night out to myself.

211
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:04,589
I just... Tim's got a lot to
of stuff to do this weekend

212
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:07,459
and I just need a break
to be honest with you.

213
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:09,461
I love you. Call me back. Bye.

214
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:29,614
You're on the hook
for next time.

215
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:31,816
Okay. Have fun.

216
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:34,085
- Don't have too much fun.
- I won't.

217
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,720
Okay, say hi to everybody.

218
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:36,988
Yes, I will.

219
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,957
- Love you guys.
- We love you, Daddy.

220
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,992
- Bye.
- -Bye.

221
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:43,995
Okay, bud, you're ready to
go see Grandma and Pop-pop?

222
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:45,096
Yeah.

223
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,865
Don't forget the taxes.

224
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:48,500
Don't forget the taxes.

225
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:50,802
I won't.

226
00:12:50,804 --> 00:12:53,772
Why don't I come to you? Because I
haven't seen the kids in so long.

227
00:12:53,774 --> 00:12:58,176
That would be so nice, and then
we'll just do it from there.

228
00:12:58,178 --> 00:12:59,811
Cool?

229
00:12:59,813 --> 00:13:03,848
All right, get ready, baby. We are
gonna have a fun Saturday night.

230
00:13:10,524 --> 00:13:12,590
- Mama?
- -Yeah?

231
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:14,659
Why isn't Daddy here?

232
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:20,165
Because Daddy had to stay home and do
some things that Mommy wanted him to do.

233
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,768
Because Daddy
has some responsibilities.

234
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:27,672
Oh, what is a responsibility?

235
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:30,441
- What's a responsibility?
- Yeah.

236
00:13:30,443 --> 00:13:35,780
Sometimes mommies want daddies to
pitch in and help out and do things,

237
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:37,448
and those are called
responsibilities.

238
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:41,719
And if you don't do them,
then Mommy comes after you

239
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:47,125
and goes, "Rawr! Why didn't you do
everything I wanted you to do?"

240
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:49,260
- You don't like when Mommy
gets like that. -No.

241
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:51,229
No. I don't like it
either, actually.

242
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,365
So Daddy is at home
doing his homework.

243
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:56,968
- Right?
- Yeah.

244
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,145
Yeah!

245
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,722
- Hey, man.
- -Hey, man.

246
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,056
- How are you?
- -Good.

247
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,491
Can you believe it?

248
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:56,227
This is very strange.

249
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:59,163
Very unusual for people like me
to be at a place like this.

250
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:01,432
- It's the best, right?
- Yeah. Thanks for having me.

251
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,067
Yeah, you got it.

252
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,236
I'm just griling out, man.
Check it out.

253
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,572
Explore the place.
This is all ours tonight.

254
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,540
There's a pool, there's a hill.

255
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:10,909
Yeah?

256
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,246
I think I am gonna walk around.
This whole place is hers?

257
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,915
Everything.

258
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,316
Hey, would you grab some buns?

259
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:21,619
Yeah, yeah.

260
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:25,590
I'm gonna pee in each of the
bathrooms, is that okay?

261
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:28,793
<i>So then the lesson is, "Hopefully
you get a really lucky,</i>"

262
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:32,063
and your grandmother marries a
man who's got a lot of money,

263
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:34,198
and then therefore you get
to go to private school,

264
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,234
"but your parents couldn't
have sent you there."

265
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:37,669
Yeah.

266
00:15:37,671 --> 00:15:40,805
And so then you're essentially
alienated from your own surroundings.

267
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:42,974
Right.

268
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:45,810
Yeah, I mean, there's
pros and cons to both.

269
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:49,681
I think the optimistic choice is
sending them to public school

270
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:50,949
because we teach
at public school.

271
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,650
That's right. That's right.

272
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:54,452
If we don't believe that you can
send your kids to public school.

273
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,587
- Then what am I doing?
- That's right. What are we...

274
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:57,855
Yeah, what are we doing?

275
00:15:57,857 --> 00:15:59,791
Yeah, what is that lesson then?

276
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:02,460
I teach there,
but my kid doesn't go.

277
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,095
- Very cynical.
- Yes.

278
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:05,997
I'm very cynical.

279
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:08,399
Mind you, I teach gym.

280
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:12,337
We would start constructing the
fire when there was still light.

281
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:14,072
- That's right.
- So we, you know,

282
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:16,174
we could do it right,
the tepee.

283
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:17,709
No, I'm good, thanks.

284
00:16:17,711 --> 00:16:19,243
Here you go, Paul.

285
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:21,012
When we told her, you know...

286
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:23,047
So we were with the cat and it's
like, "We don't believe in anything."

287
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:24,882
We don't believe
you're going to cat heaven."

288
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:28,686
So it's like we're just telling her, like,
"We appreciate that you were alive."

289
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:32,190
- Oh, jeez. -Like it's just so...
It's devastating.

290
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:35,760
You know what, though, having someone come
over and put the cat out of its misery,

291
00:16:35,762 --> 00:16:38,696
way better
than taking an animal in.

292
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:42,266
'Cause the last thing they'll remember
is all this panic and fear in the car.

293
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:44,002
- You shouldn't take them in.
- No.

294
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:46,738
I think you have to put
them down at the house.

295
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,741
I think it's funny
'cause it's just like...

296
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:55,346
Cremation versus burial is such a
no-brainer when I think about it.

297
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,882
It's like crem...
Everyone should be cremated.

298
00:16:57,884 --> 00:16:59,450
Why is it a no-brainer?

299
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:01,219
Because there's too many people
on the earth, there's no space.

300
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:03,588
- Oh, you mean practically?
- Yeah.

301
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,526
So no one got it. All right.

302
00:17:08,894 --> 00:17:10,194
150!

303
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,800
That was a nice toss, though.

304
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:17,602
Oh, yeah, thanks.

305
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:19,037
- Okay.
- -Perfect.

306
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,474
350 to 280 to 120. One hundred!

307
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,707
<i>420 to 180 to 130.</i>

308
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:10,655
Hey, uh...

309
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:13,524
Sorry, um...

310
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:17,195
Did I get the wrong house?
I'm looking for a Tim guy.

311
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:19,197
Oh, yeah, Tim's in the kitchen.

312
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:20,865
Hey, man!

313
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:22,066
Whoa!

314
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:23,835
Look at this guy!

315
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:26,070
- What's up, homie?
- Yes, man!

316
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:27,271
- You made it.
- Look at this guy.

317
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:29,207
Look at this beautiful face.

318
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:32,310
And the fucking bod!

319
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:35,113
- Hey, man.
- -I'm so glad you came, man.

320
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:37,248
- Good, I'm so glad to be here,
- I miss you.

321
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,617
What are you guys doing,
dick-sucking-cock fest over here?

322
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,752
- What's happening?
- No. Hey, let's get a beer.

323
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:45,189
- What's going on?
- -You fucking made it, man!

324
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:50,194
The Weight Watchers points just on the
hamburger bun is like 12-13 points.

325
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:51,863
No hamburger.

326
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,834
Ray, you want one of these?

327
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:58,536
So they were literally I'd say about
three feet apart from each other.

328
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:00,104
Any more people
coming to the...

329
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:03,241
I found this, which I
don't know what that is.

330
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:05,276
And then I found that, man.

331
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:07,578
What the fuck?

332
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,679
Grab it. Yeah.

333
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:10,715
Wow.

334
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:13,117
- That was in the...
- That was in the... Yeah.

335
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:16,420
I mean, that was probably a foot and a half in the
ground and that's on the hill, but check it out.

336
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:18,422
I mean, the land is crazy.

337
00:19:18,424 --> 00:19:21,926
- That's beautiful, look at that.
- That's pretty awesome, man.

338
00:19:21,928 --> 00:19:25,930
Tim, you want a peanut butter
and boysenberry sandwich?

339
00:19:25,932 --> 00:19:29,267
Well, what do we... Let's go down
there and let's dig this shit up.

340
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:31,235
I did. Well, I got
this out there,

341
00:19:31,237 --> 00:19:32,937
Well, let's keep digging.

342
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:34,572
- Why don't we keep digging?
- Yeah.

343
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:37,074
I think we're gonna
just sort of hang here.

344
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:38,676
- I'm in.
- Yeah.

345
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,411
Let's do this.

346
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:42,373
Let's hold it down. You
guys, let's hang here...

347
00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:43,318
Come on. Let's go.

348
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,283
Okay, that's you.

349
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:47,251
All right.

350
00:20:04,437 --> 00:20:05,903
Come on, it's gonna be fun.

351
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:07,271
Yeah?

352
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,177
This is great.

353
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:15,880
What are you doing?
Watch your steps right here, guys.

354
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:20,985
That's it, down there.

355
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:25,590
So this is where
I found the bone, guys.

356
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:29,260
And then right here I dug a little
bit deeper, if you see that hole,

357
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:31,028
this is where the gun was.

358
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:34,365
So, Adam, you wanna jump up there?
You mind taking the lead?

359
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:36,133
Paul, you wanna get in there?
Yeah, awesome.

360
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:37,468
Actually, leave that light.

361
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,503
Yeah, and then if we
just get in here...

362
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:41,906
- Ray, you wanna... You and
me can work this. -Yeah.

363
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:44,942
Uh, and Phil, just, you know, I mean,
like, whatever you want, buddy.

364
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:58,723
You can't just dig up someone's yard.
I think it's illegal.

365
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:04,562
Holy shit!

366
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:11,068
Dudes, a license plate.
Nevada. 5752673.

367
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,304
- Wow.
- That's like, wow!

368
00:21:14,506 --> 00:21:16,707
It's just gar...
There's garbage in the ground.

369
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:19,110
If you dig far enough
you'll find a landfill.

370
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:22,413
Stop, Phil. Stop, man. This
is really fucking exciting.

371
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:24,081
- That's a great find, dude.
- Thanks, man.

372
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,616
I think this is a good area.

373
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,985
- So that was right here? -Yeah,
let's stick around here then.

374
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:29,820
Look, if you don't wanna dig,

375
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:32,590
how about some hookers?

376
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:36,694
No, no, I, uh... That's sort of
an illogical jump you just made.

377
00:21:36,696 --> 00:21:40,231
You went from digging
in the yard to hookers?

378
00:21:40,233 --> 00:21:43,968
That seems sort of irrational.

379
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,803
I was having a great time.

380
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,171
You wanna play 500?

381
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:48,873
Yeah, we could play 500.

382
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:51,409
Guys, stop fighting, stop it.
Let's just enjoy...

383
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:53,204
I'm not fighting. I'm
actually being inquisi...

384
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,512
I'm really asking
a real question.

385
00:21:54,514 --> 00:21:57,815
Let's just enjoy the moment. There
could be a dead body right beneath us.

386
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:00,685
You know, it's pretty
fucking exciting, Phil.

387
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,487
- It could be any...
- Well, I mean, you know,

388
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:04,922
if Phil doesn't
wanna dig, that's cool.

389
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:07,792
I'm not gonna judge him
He doesn't have to dig.

390
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:10,761
But I'm just saying,
is there an alternative

391
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,132
to digging? Do you have
another alternative?

392
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:17,468
Because I'm game.
I'm open to ideas.

393
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,270
- Go to a bar or something?
- What the fuck is that?

394
00:22:19,272 --> 00:22:20,471
It was right there.

395
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:22,406
- You just found it?
- Yeah.

396
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:25,142
Hold on, let me see that.
Are you kidding me, dude?

397
00:22:25,144 --> 00:22:26,577
It was right there.

398
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:33,250
This is too weird for me, man.

399
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:36,153
Wow, this is for real.

400
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:37,455
Admit it, Phil.

401
00:22:37,457 --> 00:22:39,557
It's strange. That's strange.

402
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:43,060
Let me see that. Look at that.

403
00:22:43,062 --> 00:22:45,296
- All right. -That's some
real <i> Quest for Fire...</i>

404
00:22:45,298 --> 00:22:47,288
- We gotta go deep. We
gotta go all the way out.

405
00:22:47,314 --> 00:22:48,466
<i>- ...2001</i> shit, right there.

406
00:22:48,468 --> 00:22:51,828
For a cadaver, they're
worth a lot of money.

407
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:52,970
I know.

408
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:55,272
No. I mean, I know that,
I think, from like...

409
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:56,841
I'm gonna get a beer.

410
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,910
Yes, please.

411
00:22:59,912 --> 00:23:04,048
But I do know that for a fact
because I think back in the '60s...

412
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,083
- Holy shit.
- You okay?

413
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:07,151
Phil, are you all right?

414
00:23:07,153 --> 00:23:09,387
I think I'll be
all right long-term.

415
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:11,622
Aah!

416
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:13,724
- You're sure? -No, I'll be all right.
I'll be all right.

417
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:16,227
I think we should call it
a night, don't you think?

418
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:18,362
So it's on. It's happening?

419
00:23:18,364 --> 00:23:19,964
What's happening, brother?

420
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:22,833
It's on. Billy T's coming.
He's bringing these two broads.

421
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:24,201
Tango is coming here?

422
00:23:24,203 --> 00:23:26,270
Yeah, he's bringing some fucking tarts.
I don't know...

423
00:23:26,272 --> 00:23:27,471
It's gonna be awesome.

424
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:29,340
Who's Billy T?

425
00:23:29,342 --> 00:23:31,308
Tango. Tango. Yeah.

426
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,177
He's coming now.

427
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:35,446
He's coming now. Right now.

428
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:37,148
Timmy, we should, uh...

429
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:40,151
We should talk this out, right?

430
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:43,721
Tango is coming, man.
It's gonna be beautiful.

431
00:23:43,723 --> 00:23:45,990
Yeah, I, uh...

432
00:23:45,992 --> 00:23:48,826
We should probably check
before the evening changes.

433
00:23:50,195 --> 00:23:52,897
Don't break that.
Jude loves it.

434
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:57,067
Are you, are you okay? Do you need me?
You need me here?

435
00:23:57,069 --> 00:24:01,238
I don't know. Not unless you wanna come.
I mean, if you wanna stay, stay.

436
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:05,676
No, I'm gonna go. I just want
you to know I'm here for you.

437
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:08,145
- Yeah, I'm good.
- Okay.

438
00:24:08,147 --> 00:24:11,081
- You're okay? -I'm gonna go.
Yeah, no, it's good.

439
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,520
I'm gonna put you in.
Put your legs in.

440
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:17,655
Really nice to meet you.

441
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:19,457
There we go. There we go.

442
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:21,325
- Hey!
- Hello!

443
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:22,860
Hey, come on!

444
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:26,664
- Hey, what's up, man?
- -Yeah!

445
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:28,199
- What's going on?
- -Tango!

446
00:24:28,201 --> 00:24:30,134
We're doing it? We're doing it?

447
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:32,770
What's up, man?

448
00:24:32,772 --> 00:24:34,672
- It's good to see you, bro.
- It's good to see you.

449
00:24:34,674 --> 00:24:37,808
Hello. Hi. That was
the ride of my life.

450
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,276
I think we should
do it for America.

451
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:40,644
Tango?

452
00:24:41,613 --> 00:24:44,014
Girls, want a hit or something?

453
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:46,584
Hi. Thank you so much
for having us over.

454
00:24:46,586 --> 00:24:48,486
- Hey, thanks for coming.
- That's so nice.

455
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:51,358
Cougars are getting younger.
Like, when I was...

456
00:24:51,384 --> 00:24:52,823
Like, MILFs were like...

457
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:55,359
- Now the MILFs are like 28, right?
- -Yeah.

458
00:24:55,361 --> 00:24:57,094
And the cougars are like...

459
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:59,630
Can we go in the house,
is that okay?

460
00:24:59,632 --> 00:25:02,032
- Is it cool if we go in the house?
- Yeah.

461
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:04,235
I'm gonna make the girls
squirt tonight.

462
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:06,871
Easy, easy.

463
00:25:06,873 --> 00:25:08,572
- Check you out. -Use
a condom, at least.

464
00:25:08,574 --> 00:25:10,841
- What do you think of the other one?
You like the other one? -Beautiful.

465
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,344
Yeah. I mean, I'd do anything but
we gotta give him first dibs.

466
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:15,141
- No. You guys fuckin'...
Are you kidding me?

467
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:16,780
You... Fuck you, fuck you.
- Come on, man.

468
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:19,216
You know what his wife said?

469
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:21,318
You're crazy, man.

470
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,653
Who do you want, man?

471
00:25:22,655 --> 00:25:24,588
No, but I want you to be happy.

472
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:27,458
What the fuck is this, man?
Peanut butter and jelly?

473
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:31,428
It's kind of nice to just hang out.
And I actually miss seeing you, man.

474
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,097
You don't want
a little side action?

475
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:34,331
- I miss you too.
- Yeah.

476
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:36,300
Hey, man,
you got some coke on your...

477
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:40,738
- Speak of the devil.
- Yeah.

478
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,673
It's crazy having a kid.

479
00:25:42,675 --> 00:25:44,742
It fucking changes...

480
00:25:44,744 --> 00:25:48,312
I've been wanting to talk to you about this. I
have these conversations with you in my head.

481
00:25:48,314 --> 00:25:50,614
No sleep. No sleep.

482
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,616
No sleep.

483
00:25:52,618 --> 00:25:54,418
That's part of it.

484
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:57,121
I couldn't do it.
No sleep, man.

485
00:25:57,123 --> 00:26:00,524
- Yeah, the sleeples...
- How do you, how do you sleep?

486
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:02,293
Yeah, yeah.

487
00:26:02,295 --> 00:26:05,062
I can't do it.
I gotta sleep, man.

488
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,397
Also, there's a person...

489
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:08,032
I mean, I'm not...

490
00:26:08,034 --> 00:26:11,602
I can't do that. I can't...
I gotta sleep, man.

491
00:26:11,604 --> 00:26:13,871
The lack of sleep
fucks with you, man, but...

492
00:26:13,873 --> 00:26:16,607
You know, there's, like, this human
being just looking up to me to be...

493
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:18,642
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

494
00:26:18,644 --> 00:26:21,011
- Jesus!
- Is your wife cool?

495
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:28,152
Is she cool? I mean, does she let you hang out? Does
she let you have some time and be free and be cool?

496
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:30,020
Can you hang out?

497
00:26:30,022 --> 00:26:32,489
She's great, you know,
all bullshit aside.

498
00:26:32,491 --> 00:26:34,792
- You're not trapped?
- No.

499
00:26:34,794 --> 00:26:37,194
- No, you know... -I can't
fucking handle that, man.

500
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:39,363
You know, I can't fucking...

501
00:26:39,365 --> 00:26:42,845
I can't handle being trapped,
man, you know what I mean?

502
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:49,640
- Whoo!
- I did it, I did it, I did it!

503
00:26:49,642 --> 00:26:51,008
Just give me one good thing.

504
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,110
Ray-ray!

505
00:26:56,182 --> 00:26:57,381
Oh!

506
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:10,728
Whoa!

507
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,096
What are you doing?

508
00:27:12,098 --> 00:27:14,298
Uh...

509
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,733
Just digging for something.

510
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:17,534
- Cool.
- Yeah.

511
00:27:17,536 --> 00:27:20,904
For something?
What kind of something?

512
00:27:20,906 --> 00:27:22,539
- What's that?
- What?

513
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:26,744
I just found uh, some stuff earlier.
I found like a bone and...

514
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:29,380
Yeah.

515
00:27:29,382 --> 00:27:31,635
You're amazing. Look at you.
What are you, Fred Astaire?

516
00:27:31,661 --> 00:27:33,651
You're gonna tap dance for
me, you fucking poopie?

517
00:27:33,653 --> 00:27:39,490
You gonna fucking... Get in the pool and
fucking do a tap dance, motherfucker.

518
00:27:39,492 --> 00:27:43,560
It's not... This isn't my house, so
I'm not moving it all out I'm just...

519
00:27:43,562 --> 00:27:45,229
- This isn't?
- No.

520
00:27:45,231 --> 00:27:48,932
My wife and I are staying
here for a few weeks.

521
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:51,301
- Sweet.
- Yeah.

522
00:27:51,303 --> 00:27:53,303
- That's a good deal.
- It's a great deal.

523
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:54,872
Yeah.

524
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:03,893
I wanna help you find the body.

525
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:07,051
Well, there's a shovel
right there.

526
00:28:07,053 --> 00:28:09,613
Great, that's all
I needed to hear.

527
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,856
<i>Chica! Chica! Chica!</i>

528
00:28:13,925 --> 00:28:16,126
Yeah, where is that<i> chica?</i>

529
00:28:16,128 --> 00:28:17,194
I don't know.

530
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:18,495
Get that<i> chica</i> over here.

531
00:28:18,497 --> 00:28:20,631
- Hey, hey, hey. Hey!
- Hey.

532
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:42,352
- Yeah, that's nice.
- You're bringing it, huh?

533
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:44,054
I could do this.

534
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:45,456
I got it.

535
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:54,398
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?

536
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:04,633
- Oh, it's colder than I thought!
- Hey, man!

537
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,310
Don't try and have sex with me.

538
00:29:06,312 --> 00:29:09,446
Oh, I didn't know
it was time to show off.

539
00:29:18,057 --> 00:29:20,417
Oh, that wasn't funny.

540
00:29:47,887 --> 00:29:49,186
Where's<i> chica?</i>

541
00:30:09,675 --> 00:30:11,241
Hey, give me that...

542
00:30:17,715 --> 00:30:19,149
Hey.

543
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:25,222
I gotta show this to Ray.
He's gonna lose his shit.

544
00:30:25,224 --> 00:30:27,424
- What did you find?
- Ray, I found a shoe, buddy!

545
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:30,160
- A what?
- -Ray! Ray!

546
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,462
Ray! Ray.

547
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:35,165
Ray, I found a shoe.

548
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,567
Hey, man, that's awesome.

549
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:38,936
Dude, I found a shoe.
It was right by the gun, so...

550
00:30:38,938 --> 00:30:40,470
- That's great. Let me check it out, man.
- Yeah, man.

551
00:30:40,472 --> 00:30:42,239
- It's unbelievable.
- That's awesome, bro.

552
00:30:42,241 --> 00:30:45,776
Yeah, that was prob...
Oh, no, no, no! No.

553
00:30:45,778 --> 00:30:47,611
Oh, man, Ray.

554
00:30:47,613 --> 00:30:51,148
- What do you got there?
You got a joint? -Yeah.

555
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:53,250
You threw the shoe
in the pool, man.

556
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:55,986
Oh, man.

557
00:30:55,988 --> 00:30:57,754
- How's it doing?
- Yeah, it's good.

558
00:30:57,756 --> 00:31:00,057
- Smoting... Smoking up marijuana...
- Smoting?

559
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:03,927
I think if there's any clue that says that
there's somebody out there, Ray, it's this.

560
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:06,029
Smoke the dutchie often,
if you know what I mean.

561
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,432
Who would just throw this...

562
00:31:08,434 --> 00:31:10,067
It's fucking nuts.

563
00:31:10,069 --> 00:31:13,203
I can't even understand
what you're saying anymore.

564
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,245
All right,
I'm gonna hit the sack.

565
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:20,143
All right, guys.

566
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:21,411
All right,
good night, everybody.

567
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:23,714
It's like you got Jekyll
and then you got Hyde.

568
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:25,468
And then you got Jekyll,
and then you get Hyde.

569
00:31:25,494 --> 00:31:27,184
Stay as long as you want.
Enjoy the night.

570
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:29,419
- You know what I mean? You punk rock?
- I don't wanna look at it.

571
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:31,622
Oh, shit.

572
00:31:31,624 --> 00:31:36,059
- I'm gonna fucking...
- I will whip this at you!

573
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:44,134
- Okay, okay, okay.

574
00:33:08,854 --> 00:33:10,787
- This is a crossroads.
- -Mm-hmm.

575
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:13,757
- This is a very important...
- It's not a crossroads.

576
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:15,492
The kid's three years old.

577
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:18,829
- But, darling...
- -It's not the crossroads of his life.

578
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:20,497
- Right.
- -Yes.

579
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:24,434
You think the best education he could
possibly get is in a public school?

580
00:33:24,436 --> 00:33:29,206
No, actually, I don't. But sometimes
I think it's a compromise.

581
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:31,308
What? No. It doesn't
have to be a compromise.

582
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,210
- It is. Marriage is a compromise.
- Why?

583
00:33:33,212 --> 00:33:34,945
- Well, life's a compromise.
- Yes, but...

584
00:33:34,947 --> 00:33:38,015
- Life's a compromise. -Can we
stop talking in platitudes?

585
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:39,783
- Life's a compromise.
- Please? Look.

586
00:33:39,785 --> 00:33:43,887
We think it's important for him to have
the best education that he can have

587
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:45,322
- and I know you do too.
- Mm-hmm.

588
00:33:45,324 --> 00:33:47,557
And so now you're under
the cover of your marriage.

589
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,459
- And Tim does too.
- I...

590
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:53,630
Tim is prejudiced because he works
in the public school system

591
00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:54,931
and that's the difference.

592
00:33:54,933 --> 00:33:56,666
That's kind of harsh.
I don't think he's prejudiced.

593
00:33:56,668 --> 00:33:58,435
- He just believes in the pu...
- It's not harsh, it's the truth.

594
00:33:58,437 --> 00:34:00,464
I feel like the voices
are getting really...

595
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:00,971
- Mama!

596
00:34:00,973 --> 00:34:03,807
- I'm sorry, buddy. Yeah?
- I'm sorry.

597
00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:06,576
Oh, wait. I think I know
what I need to do.

598
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:08,412
I know what I need to do.

599
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:16,887
I think I have 15 blueberries
and you have 14.

600
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:20,390
No, I have 15 too.

601
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:21,792
- You do?
- Yeah.

602
00:34:21,794 --> 00:34:23,760
Look, I have 16.

603
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:27,763
We're getting a lot
of anti-oxidants.

604
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:31,134
Okay.

605
00:34:47,985 --> 00:34:50,220
- <i> Knock, knock.</i>
- -<i> Who's there?</i>

606
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:52,522
<i>- Orange.</i>
<i>- Orange who?</i>

607
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:54,257
<i>- Knock, knock.</i>
<i>- Who's there?</i>

608
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:55,992
<i>- Banana.</i>
<i>- Banana who?</i>

609
00:34:55,994 --> 00:34:57,894
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

610
00:34:57,896 --> 00:34:59,563
- Banana.
- Banana who?

611
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:03,633
Didn't you glad I didn't say...

612
00:35:03,635 --> 00:35:04,935
Orange?

613
00:35:04,937 --> 00:35:06,670
I'm just waiting
to get my life back.

614
00:35:06,672 --> 00:35:08,305
What does that mean?

615
00:35:08,307 --> 00:35:12,943
When did it come back?
When do you go from being...

616
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:16,246
I mean, you know, it's the
great joy of my life to be...

617
00:35:16,248 --> 00:35:18,882
- I did it. -I know you did.
Thank you, buddy.

618
00:35:18,884 --> 00:35:20,283
To be mom.

619
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:23,019
But when am I mom and...
All right, you wanna step in?

620
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:24,988
I'm gonna do this one.
All right, step in.

621
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:28,692
I'm asking you when did you feel
like you got back to yourself?

622
00:35:28,694 --> 00:35:31,061
When I divorced your father.

623
00:35:31,063 --> 00:35:33,096
I knew you were gonna say that.

624
00:35:33,098 --> 00:35:34,397
Can you zip these up?

625
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:36,833
No, I'm not
recommending divorce.

626
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:39,503
No, I thought you were gonna say, "I'm not
kidding." I'm like, I know you're not.

627
00:35:39,505 --> 00:35:41,705
Can you zip these up for me?
You know how to do that part.

628
00:35:41,707 --> 00:35:47,577
But there was something truthful
about my having my own life again.

629
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:50,413
Doing pretty good
for an old man.

630
00:35:50,415 --> 00:35:53,283
- I feel like an old man.

631
00:35:53,285 --> 00:35:54,651
<i>It's hard to have</i>
<i>a separate life.</i>

632
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:57,587
- You do, though?
- Yeah, I feel like I do.

633
00:35:57,589 --> 00:36:00,056
But I think it's the hardest
thing, somehow, getting married.

634
00:36:00,058 --> 00:36:05,262
It's like, well am I a couple or
am I still the person, you know?

635
00:36:05,264 --> 00:36:07,130
It's really...

636
00:36:07,132 --> 00:36:13,370
It's key to remain the person that
brought something to a relationship.

637
00:36:13,372 --> 00:36:15,639
And being in love,
man, we being in love.

638
00:36:15,641 --> 00:36:20,911
What is that? Getting what you want or
is it giving somebody what they want?

639
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:25,382
Sacrificing, if you
want to call it that.

640
00:36:25,384 --> 00:36:26,883
<i>Two, three.</i>

641
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:28,451
- Cheese!
- Cheese!

642
00:36:28,453 --> 00:36:30,287
Okay, you wanna come down?

643
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:31,521
Uh...

644
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,423
Here, you want me
to give you a push?

645
00:36:33,425 --> 00:36:35,959
Okay, I'll give you
a little push.

646
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:39,596
Whoa, oh, whoa!

647
00:36:39,598 --> 00:36:44,201
Can I take a picture of you
with Grandma and Pop-pop?

648
00:36:44,203 --> 00:36:47,504
No? I gotta take a picture
for Daddy.

649
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:17,934
All right.

650
00:37:39,024 --> 00:37:41,591
- Hey, neighbor.
- Oh, hey.

651
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:45,228
- Sorry, I should have called.
- No. Stop. How are you?

652
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,664
I'm good, I just brought
something up for Lee.

653
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:49,966
Oh, she and the boy
are gone for the weekend.

654
00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:52,369
- Oh, they are?
- Yeah. Oh, okay.

655
00:37:52,371 --> 00:37:54,604
Wanna get a cup of coffee or something?
You wanna come in?

656
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:57,440
Uh, I don't wanna be
any trouble.

657
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,509
Better than not doing anything.

658
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:02,012
Here you go, my friend.

659
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:04,247
That's all I get?

660
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:07,617
- That's all that's left?
- Yeah, that's all that...

661
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,120
- I mean, it's yours if you
want it, but... -Nah.

662
00:38:10,122 --> 00:38:12,389
Sorry about that, it's my friend's.
I don't do cocaine, actually.

663
00:38:12,391 --> 00:38:14,491
- I don't either.
- Yeah, I'm a weed guy.

664
00:38:14,493 --> 00:38:18,395
You know, if you need a little bit of help
digging your swimming pool down there,

665
00:38:18,397 --> 00:38:20,363
I got a brother-in-law
that does that business.

666
00:38:20,365 --> 00:38:22,666
Oh, no, the... Last night.

667
00:38:22,668 --> 00:38:25,035
No, we were just
goofing around, just...

668
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:27,637
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I uh...

669
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:30,006
I'd found... I'd been doing a
little gardening for Julia

670
00:38:30,008 --> 00:38:33,043
and I found some stuff and,
you know, it was interesting.

671
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:37,881
Doing some Indiana Jones
stuff, I guess.

672
00:38:37,883 --> 00:38:41,685
Well, a lot of weird shit
happened around here.

673
00:38:41,687 --> 00:38:43,153
Man, you said it.

674
00:38:43,155 --> 00:38:44,921
That's the stuff
I like to get into.

675
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:46,956
Oh, really?

676
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:49,426
Yeah, it's fun.

677
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,996
Well, sometimes
not so much fun.

678
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:57,334
You want all those spirits to come
up here and join your family?

679
00:38:57,336 --> 00:38:59,788
Well, that's interesting.
That was kind of the debate.

680
00:38:59,814 --> 00:39:01,438
'Cause Lee said not
to mess with it.

681
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,506
- Yeah. -She said it was kind
of none of my business.

682
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:05,002
But my thought is like,
there's something in me,

683
00:39:05,028 --> 00:39:06,343
and I don't know if you
can relate to this,

684
00:39:06,345 --> 00:39:11,147
but there's something, if there's something down
there, part of me has got to know what it is.

685
00:39:11,149 --> 00:39:17,087
Well, I know what it is, but there ain't
no way I'm gonna go digging down there.

686
00:39:17,089 --> 00:39:21,891
- Right? Have all that shit
come back on my family.

687
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:25,253
You don't wanna find anything
down there, believe me.

688
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:32,435
Yeah, I know.

689
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:36,106
The Chicano Hall of Fame
is down there.

690
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:41,277
Okay. Thanks for stopping by.

691
00:41:06,598 --> 00:41:09,299
<i>And I keep thinking the older I
get the more I'm gonna know,</i>

692
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:13,903
and I don't, I'm just getting older and
fatter, and, like, more broken down.

693
00:41:16,073 --> 00:41:17,474
And that's true.

694
00:41:17,476 --> 00:41:19,509
You know when you talk to like
an old man, or at least for me,

695
00:41:19,511 --> 00:41:22,745
you know, they'll say like, "It's weird
when we talk because I feel your age,"

696
00:41:22,747 --> 00:41:24,814
and then I look
in the mirror and I'm not.

697
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:27,517
- That's starting to happen.
- Oh, really?

698
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:32,388
With... I'm like... This is... I was with two
16-year-old boys and we were, like, goofing around,

699
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:33,756
Why were you with
two 16-year-old boys?

700
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:35,625
- It was a work thing. I'm a teacher.
- Oh, okay.

701
00:41:35,627 --> 00:41:39,095
But we were, like, having fun, and,
like, laughing and doing bits.

702
00:41:39,097 --> 00:41:42,165
We were doing like, "Ooh, kill 'em, kill
'em." and they're like, "You don't..."

703
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:44,033
And we were like, all laughing.

704
00:41:44,035 --> 00:41:47,804
And I saw the reflection of
this, like, of the car in the

705
00:41:47,806 --> 00:41:50,406
and I was so old,
and they were so...

706
00:41:50,408 --> 00:41:54,077
And I had that thought
of like, wow!

707
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,747
But I didn't feel different
when we were having fun.

708
00:41:57,749 --> 00:42:00,917
And that made me feel like,
I am gonna die.

709
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:40,490
- Hey!
- Yeah?

710
00:42:40,492 --> 00:42:42,425
I found something!
I found something!

711
00:42:42,427 --> 00:42:43,760
Ooh!

712
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:46,095
Holy shit.

713
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,968
I just found a bag of bones.

714
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:54,237
Oh, my God.

715
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:56,072
So somebody had bones...

716
00:42:56,074 --> 00:42:59,675
Chopped them up, put them
in a bag, put them in here.

717
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:03,079
Yeah, here.
It's an awesome find.

718
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:07,850
This is so cool. It's like, the
most weird Easter egg hunt.

719
00:43:07,852 --> 00:43:10,186
- Oh, God.
- Good job, good find.

720
00:43:10,188 --> 00:43:11,654
Thank you.

721
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:13,089
Mom?

722
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,772
Mom?

723
00:43:40,986 --> 00:43:43,119
Okay, give me a kiss. Mwah.

724
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:46,389
- All right, you're gonna play with
Grandma and Grandpa, okay? -Okay.

725
00:43:46,391 --> 00:43:48,625
- I love you.
- I love you too.

726
00:43:48,627 --> 00:43:51,060
Have fun!

727
00:43:51,062 --> 00:43:52,495
Bye, Grandma.

728
00:44:03,408 --> 00:44:04,741
Hi.

729
00:44:04,743 --> 00:44:06,843
- Hey. Are you Lee?
- I am.

730
00:44:06,845 --> 00:44:08,945
Oh, good.
I'm so glad I found you.

731
00:44:08,947 --> 00:44:13,316
- The GPS took me... -I know. It always goes
up Deerpath and then you can't get through.

732
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:15,018
I know, I'm sorry.

733
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:16,619
So am I.

734
00:44:16,621 --> 00:44:18,254
Where are you going?

735
00:44:18,256 --> 00:44:20,736
- Big Brackwood. I'll tell you
how to get there. -Oh, awesome.

736
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,630
Was that your house?

737
00:44:27,632 --> 00:44:30,333
No, no. I mean, I wish.

738
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:33,903
Well, I don't know if I wish.
I mean, it was my mom's house.

739
00:44:33,905 --> 00:44:36,172
- It's really nice.
- It is really nice.

740
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:38,508
My house is not very nice.

741
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:39,642
No.

742
00:44:39,644 --> 00:44:41,344
No. We live on the east side.

743
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:42,979
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah, Atwater Village.

744
00:44:42,981 --> 00:44:44,514
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I know where that is.

745
00:44:44,516 --> 00:44:48,151
Yeah, we don't even live in a house.
We live in a duplex.

746
00:44:48,153 --> 00:44:50,517
That's still nice. You can
pretend to have a house.

747
00:44:50,543 --> 00:44:51,654
Yeah, I know, right?

748
00:44:51,656 --> 00:44:54,390
Sort of. I think we thought we were
gonna move out of it and get a house

749
00:44:54,392 --> 00:44:57,126
several years ago,
but it hasn't panned out yet.

750
00:44:57,128 --> 00:44:58,995
I kind of like
driving around over here

751
00:44:58,997 --> 00:45:02,498
because I can sort of pretend that I
live in one of these giant houses.

752
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,567
Right?

753
00:45:04,569 --> 00:45:07,503
But I always wonder if I would be happier if I
lived in one of these, instead of an apartment?

754
00:45:07,505 --> 00:45:11,674
I think I read this study, or my
husband told me about this study,

755
00:45:11,676 --> 00:45:13,509
because we talk about
this stuff a lot,

756
00:45:13,511 --> 00:45:18,047
that they did for Harvard or something
where they said you actually,

757
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:22,285
people with money actually are
happier, live marginally happier,

758
00:45:22,287 --> 00:45:26,823
and then it kind of plateaus and
they're as unhappy as everybody else,

759
00:45:26,825 --> 00:45:30,626
but they are
a little bit happier.

760
00:45:30,628 --> 00:45:34,230
Where are my two
favorite munchkins?

761
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:36,199
- Hi.
- Hi.

762
00:45:36,201 --> 00:45:38,901
- How are you doing, darling?
- Hi, Lee. Good.

763
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:40,803
- So good to see you.
- Hey, guys, you remember Lee?

764
00:45:40,805 --> 00:45:44,373
Oh, my God, you're all wet.
I can't even hug you.

765
00:45:44,375 --> 00:45:45,875
High-five. Two hands.

766
00:45:45,877 --> 00:45:47,643
You remember Auntie Lee?

767
00:45:47,645 --> 00:45:49,846
On the side. In the hole.

768
00:45:49,848 --> 00:45:51,080
You've got soul.

769
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:53,683
- Hi, how are you?
- Good. Good to see you.

770
00:45:53,685 --> 00:45:55,318
- Good to see you too.
- Oh, this is Lucy.

771
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,554
- Hi, I'm Lucy. Nice to meet you.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

772
00:45:58,556 --> 00:46:00,690
- It's amazing.
- Wow.

773
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,795
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

774
00:46:05,797 --> 00:46:07,296
- Cheers, you guys.
- -Cheers.

775
00:46:07,298 --> 00:46:11,334
I have been counting the
minutes to this reunion.

776
00:46:11,336 --> 00:46:12,668
You wanna cheers me or no?

777
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:14,337
- Yeah, cheers.
- Okay.

778
00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:18,174
You, if you would give
that to me, I would win too.

779
00:46:18,176 --> 00:46:20,810
- Okay.
- I win!

780
00:46:20,812 --> 00:46:22,678
- How is he doing?
- He's so good.

781
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,347
I wanna eat him every day.

782
00:46:24,349 --> 00:46:25,548
You could have bought him.

783
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:27,950
You know he needs some time
with Grandma and Pop-pop,

784
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:30,920
and Mommy needs some time too.

785
00:46:30,922 --> 00:46:32,789
- How old is he now?
- Three.

786
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:35,258
- Oh.
- Yeah, it goes fast.

787
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:37,360
- Yeah, it's been a long time.
- Yeah.

788
00:46:37,362 --> 00:46:42,899
I mean, part of me wishes we could have
someone, you know, full-time, live-in...

789
00:46:42,901 --> 00:46:46,035
You could do it. I mean,
we just found her, you know?

790
00:46:46,037 --> 00:46:49,639
Um, she knew
somebody from work, so...

791
00:46:49,641 --> 00:46:52,341
Do you mind if I ask
how much you pay her?

792
00:46:52,343 --> 00:46:54,110
- Very little.
- Yeah.

793
00:46:54,112 --> 00:46:56,813
But lives in the guest house
it's kind of a big draw.

794
00:46:56,815 --> 00:46:59,949
There's kind of a deal.
She's like an actress,

795
00:46:59,951 --> 00:47:02,952
and she is auditioning.
We're kind of flexible.

796
00:47:02,954 --> 00:47:05,621
It's not...
It's an interesting...

797
00:47:05,623 --> 00:47:08,691
I think she's great. I think she fits
in really well. The kids love her.

798
00:47:08,693 --> 00:47:12,895
Here's the, here's the thing.
Tell me how you feel about this.

799
00:47:12,897 --> 00:47:18,034
We are gonna go to Costa Rica
on a family vacation.

800
00:47:18,036 --> 00:47:19,602
It was gonna be us
and the kids.

801
00:47:19,604 --> 00:47:22,338
- It's still gonna be us and the kids.
- I'm excited about it.

802
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:26,909
But suddenly, Bob thinks
that Lucy should come.

803
00:47:26,911 --> 00:47:29,412
- No. Okay, here's what happened.
- For the whole time.

804
00:47:29,414 --> 00:47:31,480
Here's what happened.
Squitch says...

805
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:37,253
- What do you think about
Costa Rica, right? -Uh-huh.

806
00:47:37,255 --> 00:47:40,756
We penciled in Costa Rica,
starting on the 10th,

807
00:47:40,758 --> 00:47:43,626
because that was the week that
seemed like it was gonna be open.

808
00:47:43,628 --> 00:47:45,995
Everybody agreed to the 10th.

809
00:47:45,997 --> 00:47:48,464
- My schedule doesn't work like your
schedule works. -The 10th is good.

810
00:47:48,466 --> 00:47:50,501
I know what it is three,
four months in advance.

811
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:52,535
I started planning... Well, it does.
It can.

812
00:47:52,537 --> 00:47:53,870
It can, it can
if you want it to.

813
00:47:53,872 --> 00:47:56,339
- It can't. It can't.
- It can if you want it to.

814
00:47:56,341 --> 00:47:58,374
- Okay, sure, if I wanna call the client...
- If you communicate...

815
00:47:58,376 --> 00:48:01,310
and say, "We're gonna drop the account.
Sorry, we're not ready",

816
00:48:01,312 --> 00:48:03,379
"and I'm going to Costa Rica."

817
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:06,282
If you communicate and you talk to me when
you find out that it's not a good date,

818
00:48:06,284 --> 00:48:07,917
you tell me then,
so I can change things.

819
00:48:07,919 --> 00:48:09,218
So I have a project,
that went over,

820
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,320
and we've got a lot of options.

821
00:48:11,322 --> 00:48:14,557
One of the options is, we can
postpone the trip and we can go...

822
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:18,294
Why don't you have just like a nice
night and have some, like, you time

823
00:48:18,296 --> 00:48:21,631
- and, like, read a, read a book...
- What does that mean?

824
00:48:21,633 --> 00:48:26,068
I feel so shitty. I don't even
know what I'm saying to you.

825
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:28,304
You're saying
you don't wanna go out.

826
00:48:28,306 --> 00:48:30,973
- I'm saying I can't, I can't.
- I know, I know.

827
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:34,010
I was really
looking forward to tonight.

828
00:48:34,012 --> 00:48:38,314
Like, on a level that I can't
even describe to you, but...

829
00:48:38,316 --> 00:48:40,950
<i>You sure you can't do it?</i>
<i>You can't push it?</i>

830
00:48:40,952 --> 00:48:43,183
<i>I know, and I'm supposed to
just let you off the hook,</i>

831
00:48:43,209 --> 00:48:45,454
<i>but I'm being so selfish and
just pushing for my needs.</i>

832
00:48:45,456 --> 00:48:49,725
<i>I was so excited to see you and
I wanted to be able to do it,</i>

833
00:48:49,727 --> 00:48:53,029
<i>but I haven't done anything</i>
<i>for like two months.</i>

834
00:48:53,031 --> 00:48:54,630
<i>Maybe you need to get out.</i>

835
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:01,771
- Hey.
- Hey.

836
00:49:01,773 --> 00:49:04,340
- What do you say we call it?
- Call it?

837
00:49:04,342 --> 00:49:06,575
Yeah. I'll buy you some dinner
as a thank you.

838
00:49:07,377 --> 00:49:10,179
- Yeah.
- You in?

839
00:49:10,181 --> 00:49:12,381
My clothes are
pretty dirty, though.

840
00:49:12,383 --> 00:49:14,083
I'll find you
some clean clothes.

841
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:16,839
- Okay.
- Okay.

842
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:19,408
- Good.
- Good.

843
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:42,111
I want...

844
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:50,019
Whoa.

845
00:49:51,288 --> 00:49:53,589
- What's up, Timmy?
- Hey, Phil, my boy.

846
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:55,958
- How are you?
- How are you?

847
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,260
- Good. -How was the
rest of the night?

848
00:49:58,262 --> 00:50:00,830
- Great, and Tango came
by, it was fun. -Yeah?

849
00:50:00,832 --> 00:50:02,665
What you up to?
What are you doing?

850
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:06,335
Just, uh, I was just in the neighborhood,
heading to soccer practice.

851
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:08,838
- You're dressed like Ray.
- -Hey, Tim?

852
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:10,439
These don't fit.

853
00:50:10,441 --> 00:50:12,808
I don't wanna go
in the closet, but...

854
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:14,250
Let's get you
something else to wear.

855
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:15,745
Okay.

856
00:50:15,747 --> 00:50:17,380
- Hi.
- Hi there.

857
00:50:17,382 --> 00:50:19,382
- Thank you.
- -Yeah.

858
00:50:34,998 --> 00:50:36,265
<i>Take anything you want.</i>

859
00:50:36,267 --> 00:50:37,666
- Just whatever? Uh...
- Honestly.

860
00:50:37,668 --> 00:50:39,935
Yeah, just grab anything
and I'll meet you downstairs.

861
00:50:39,937 --> 00:50:41,737
- Anything?
- Anything.

862
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,074
Thank you.

863
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:03,692
- Tim.
- What's up, man?

864
00:51:03,694 --> 00:51:05,661
Listen, I got to uh...
Just talk to me for a second.

865
00:51:05,663 --> 00:51:08,330
Phil, I want to clean off that table
so I won't have to do it later.

866
00:51:08,332 --> 00:51:11,801
Listen, I wanna talk to you because
you're not yourself right now,

867
00:51:11,803 --> 00:51:13,636
you're like in this
other head space,

868
00:51:13,638 --> 00:51:16,806
and, uh, I just wanna
talk to you about, like...

869
00:51:16,808 --> 00:51:19,341
I feel like we should jut go out for
dinner, like, just drop these guys.

870
00:51:19,343 --> 00:51:21,644
I have plans, man. I'm
going out with my friend.

871
00:51:21,646 --> 00:51:23,779
- No, but it would be fun It would
be just you and me. -Yeah.

872
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:27,783
And we can kind of shed this because I feel
like you're, whoo, you know what I mean?

873
00:51:27,785 --> 00:51:31,420
You're just in this other place
and I just wanna bring you back.

874
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:34,223
What do you think is going on here?
What are you implying, Phil?

875
00:51:34,225 --> 00:51:37,560
- I don't know what's going on. -I made a
friend and I'm going out to eat with her.

876
00:51:37,562 --> 00:51:41,464
Yeah, I'm not involved with this.
As a matter of fact, when...

877
00:51:41,466 --> 00:51:44,533
I'm friends with your wife.
I know your kid.

878
00:51:44,535 --> 00:51:49,338
Phil, Phil. You're a good dude.
But I've known you for two years.

879
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:53,008
- Relax. I'm fine. I'm a man.
Okay? -I'm just saying...

880
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:58,247
I'm just saying, for when I'm out with your
wife and, you know, when we're on double dates,

881
00:51:58,249 --> 00:52:00,116
I don't wanna be
an accomplice to this.

882
00:52:00,118 --> 00:52:01,817
There's not... Okay, stop.

883
00:52:01,819 --> 00:52:06,789
Your... That coat looks ridiculous,
it doesn't even button properly.

884
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:09,246
And the hat, you know, it's
practically the summer.

885
00:52:09,272 --> 00:52:10,426
You're gonna be boiling.

886
00:52:10,428 --> 00:52:12,962
<i>By the time we actually</i>

887
00:52:12,964 --> 00:52:15,831
got the divorce itself,
it was over, so...

888
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:18,134
Were you devastated?

889
00:52:18,136 --> 00:52:21,804
Oh, I was, I was a fucking mess.
I was, you know,

890
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:23,973
sobbing into the sink
every morning.

891
00:52:23,975 --> 00:52:27,076
You know, like,
it was, it was just terrible.

892
00:52:27,078 --> 00:52:33,215
But, um, since then it's been,
you know, revelatory, you know.

893
00:52:33,217 --> 00:52:36,719
And life is someplace
where I never found it before.

894
00:52:36,721 --> 00:52:43,225
You know, you live a whole... You grow up with your
parents, and you have roommates, and you do all this stuff

895
00:52:43,227 --> 00:52:47,930
and all of a sudden you're, you're
exactly what you wanna be, sort of.

896
00:52:47,932 --> 00:52:50,733
- Now.
- Now. Really, it's uh...

897
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:56,238
It's pretty amazing, you know?
No compromises.

898
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,274
No compromises.

899
00:52:58,276 --> 00:53:03,879
Nothing that really requires
anything but your own desires.

900
00:53:03,881 --> 00:53:06,615
The thing is, you just gotta
figure out what they are.

901
00:53:51,596 --> 00:53:53,662
<i>When you decide</i>
<i>what you're interested in</i>

902
00:53:53,664 --> 00:53:56,632
and it's, if you're not
seeking, then there's no part,

903
00:53:56,634 --> 00:53:59,435
and you are in a moment of your
life where you are seeking.

904
00:53:59,437 --> 00:54:02,271
- Mm-hmm. -So something
like taking ayahuasca,

905
00:54:02,273 --> 00:54:04,406
which would be
really scary for me right now,

906
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:06,976
is really exciting
and really scary.

907
00:54:06,978 --> 00:54:11,313
Because if it shifts everything up for
you, well, this is the time to do it.

908
00:54:11,315 --> 00:54:14,750
Well, I'm not set in anything right now.
You're like set in your thing.

909
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:19,822
I think what is, is everything
that excites me is what he's doing

910
00:54:19,824 --> 00:54:23,859
and not how I'm reacting to it, and
not how it's affecting my brain.

911
00:54:23,861 --> 00:54:27,329
It feels like what's happening to
me and what's happening to my wife

912
00:54:27,331 --> 00:54:28,964
kind of doesn't matter.

913
00:54:28,966 --> 00:54:32,868
- Mm-hmm. -And there's a bit of
a loss that happens between us

914
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:35,871
because our thing,
our connection, our love,

915
00:54:35,873 --> 00:54:40,676
and I know it's wrong and I know we always like... We
have, like, rules of, like, make sure we always connect,

916
00:54:40,678 --> 00:54:45,014
it's just so much more exciting
to put everything into that kid,

917
00:54:45,016 --> 00:54:48,183
in their love, in their
development, in their thought,

918
00:54:48,185 --> 00:54:51,687
and, you know,
you lose yourself in that.

919
00:54:52,255 --> 00:54:53,822
All right?

920
00:54:54,858 --> 00:54:57,059
Hi. Can I just sit at the bar?

921
00:54:57,061 --> 00:54:59,061
- Yeah, please.
- Thank you.

922
00:55:01,031 --> 00:55:03,332
- How you doing?
- Good, good, thank you.

923
00:55:03,334 --> 00:55:04,733
Want a drink?

924
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:08,904
Do you need help?

925
00:55:08,906 --> 00:55:13,709
Oh, no, thank you. Um, I'll
have a martini with a twist.

926
00:55:13,711 --> 00:55:17,146
Wait, I haven't seen this in so
long, I eat here all the time.

927
00:55:17,148 --> 00:55:18,814
What are you gonna get?

928
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:22,818
- I was thinking about...
- Uh...

929
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:25,321
- Do you guys have burgers?
- Yeah, we do.

930
00:55:25,323 --> 00:55:27,022
I don't see it on the menu.
Awesome.

931
00:55:27,024 --> 00:55:28,757
- Here you go.
- Perfect.

932
00:55:28,759 --> 00:55:30,225
You have beautiful eyes.

933
00:55:30,227 --> 00:55:32,336
Thank you. I'm just
gonna scoot over here.

934
00:55:32,362 --> 00:55:33,562
What color are they?

935
00:55:33,564 --> 00:55:37,800
Um, I think they're hazel. I think that's
what it says on my driver's license.

936
00:55:45,276 --> 00:55:46,675
Hey.

937
00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:52,648
Uh-oh.

938
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,050
Brian, what are you doing, man?

939
00:55:55,052 --> 00:55:57,353
- I'm just coming... She was
telling me about... -You good?

940
00:55:57,355 --> 00:55:58,954
No, I'm good. Yeah.

941
00:55:58,956 --> 00:56:02,024
What, are these chips?
Why did you get chips?

942
00:56:02,026 --> 00:56:04,560
- I'm enjoying some chips.
Do you want some? -Yeah.

943
00:56:05,328 --> 00:56:07,129
Eat some chips.

944
00:56:07,131 --> 00:56:08,630
Did you eat enough tonight?

945
00:56:09,933 --> 00:56:12,601
- No?
- A little. I, uh...

946
00:56:12,603 --> 00:56:14,470
Maybe one too many
to drink, huh?

947
00:56:14,472 --> 00:56:15,804
I don't think so.

948
00:56:15,806 --> 00:56:17,406
Mmm, leave some.

949
00:56:18,808 --> 00:56:20,142
What are you doing?

950
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:23,445
I'm just texting my husband.

951
00:56:23,447 --> 00:56:25,948
- Wait, those are haz... You're married?
- Mm-hmm.

952
00:56:26,649 --> 00:56:27,750
Since when?

953
00:56:29,352 --> 00:56:32,654
Since 2004.

954
00:56:32,656 --> 00:56:34,656
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

955
00:56:34,658 --> 00:56:36,825
Let's go, bud. Come
on outside, let's go.

956
00:56:36,827 --> 00:56:38,327
Excuse me.

957
00:56:38,329 --> 00:56:41,130
- Nice meeting you.
- Nice to meet you too.

958
00:56:41,132 --> 00:56:43,699
She's really not interested.
Come on, let's go.

959
00:56:43,701 --> 00:56:45,689
Brian, it's time to leave.
It's time to leave.

960
00:56:45,715 --> 00:56:47,169
No. Please, please. Seriously.

961
00:56:47,171 --> 00:56:49,471
- Really? -It's time to leave.
Let's go.

962
00:56:49,473 --> 00:56:51,540
Come on, out the door.
Brian, I'm serious. Relax.

963
00:56:51,542 --> 00:56:52,941
No, no, man, I'm serious.

964
00:56:52,943 --> 00:56:53,942
Listen, dude.

965
00:56:53,944 --> 00:56:55,844
- Why are you doing this?
- Because...

966
00:56:59,049 --> 00:57:01,383
- Oh, fuck!
- Oh, my God.

967
00:57:01,385 --> 00:57:03,452
- You!
- -Fuck you.

968
00:57:03,454 --> 00:57:05,287
- Would you just go home?
- -No.

969
00:57:05,289 --> 00:57:07,089
Fuck!

970
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:10,659
Fucking loser.

971
00:57:10,661 --> 00:57:12,928
- You okay, dude?
- Honey, will you just

972
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:15,597
- get him a cab or something?
- Yeah.

973
00:57:16,232 --> 00:57:18,033
I apologize. Sorry.

974
00:57:18,635 --> 00:57:20,335
Here you go.

975
00:57:20,337 --> 00:57:25,007
Thank you. Okay. I feel like this is
gonna hurt a little bit. Can I see it?

976
00:57:25,009 --> 00:57:26,742
- Can you take this away?
- It's gonna be fine.

977
00:57:26,744 --> 00:57:29,278
- Can you just take it for a second?
- Sure.

978
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:32,047
Okay. Oh, yeah,
yeah, yeah. Okay.

979
00:57:32,049 --> 00:57:34,783
This is like a total...

980
00:57:34,785 --> 00:57:37,519
It's fine, honestly.
It's really not a big deal.

981
00:57:37,521 --> 00:57:39,254
- And you're gonna need stitches.
- No, I'm not.

982
00:57:39,256 --> 00:57:41,048
Oh, yes. Yes, you are.
No, you really are.

983
00:57:41,074 --> 00:57:41,757
No, I'm not.

984
00:57:41,759 --> 00:57:43,764
I'm not going to a hospital.
I hate hospitals.

985
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:44,660
I fucking hate them.

986
00:57:44,662 --> 00:57:46,929
- Ow. Okay.
- Oops, sorry, sorry.

987
00:57:52,503 --> 00:57:55,737
Yeah, you're gonna need
some stitches.

988
00:57:55,739 --> 00:57:59,541
You know what we'll do, I have a friend, she's
a medical student. We'll go to her place.

989
00:57:59,543 --> 00:58:01,402
Yeah, I don't care who does
it but you really need to...

990
00:58:01,428 --> 00:58:02,511
Alicia, she's great. She's...

991
00:58:02,513 --> 00:58:04,213
- Okay.

992
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:18,427
<i>No, don't.</i>

993
00:58:18,429 --> 00:58:21,797
I feel good.
I feel great about it too.

994
00:58:21,799 --> 00:58:23,499
I'm a little hungover,
so I'm just gonna get the...

995
00:58:23,501 --> 00:58:25,267
- You're hungover? Perfect.
- Get the shakes out.

996
00:58:25,269 --> 00:58:27,369
What were you doing?

997
00:58:27,371 --> 00:58:29,571
Just, I don't know, I don't remember much.
I was at somebody's house or something.

998
00:58:29,573 --> 00:58:32,708
But do you want me to walk you
through it as I'm doing it,

999
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:34,176
- or just do it?
- -No, just do it.

1000
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:35,911
Okay, it's gonna take
a couple of deep breaths.

1001
00:58:35,913 --> 00:58:38,347
Should we do that together?
- Yeah, okay.

1002
00:58:38,349 --> 00:58:39,681
Okay.

1003
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:44,453
- How many times have you done this?
- -Plenty.

1004
00:58:44,455 --> 00:58:46,989
Plenty?
Well, like on cadavers or something?

1005
00:58:46,991 --> 00:58:49,458
No, no. I got it. I'm just
not usually in my bathroom.

1006
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:51,493
- Don't make it a thing.
- No, no. It's not a thing.

1007
00:58:51,495 --> 00:58:54,363
This is gonna be really easy.
It's just your face.

1008
00:58:54,365 --> 00:58:56,899
What have you
been getting up to?

1009
00:58:56,901 --> 00:59:00,168
- My mom was here until a
couple of days ago. -Your mom?

1010
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,871
Hold still, please.

1011
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:06,108
Right, this cotton's
itching on my face.

1012
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:09,578
Why did your mom come?
Are your parents still together?

1013
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:11,813
No, no. Are yours?

1014
00:59:11,815 --> 00:59:13,081
No.

1015
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:17,753
You know, it's funny.
I actually feel like...

1016
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:24,426
This weird thing with my friends when
their parents are together, like...

1017
00:59:24,428 --> 00:59:27,296
- You can't relate.
- Yeah, I guess.

1018
00:59:27,298 --> 00:59:31,800
It's almost like I feel like they're
inherently more naive than me or something.

1019
00:59:31,802 --> 00:59:35,237
Not like in a judgy way,
just like...

1020
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:37,673
If it hasn't happened
to your parents, you don't...

1021
00:59:37,675 --> 00:59:40,876
You don't really understand that
it can happen to you or something.

1022
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:42,611
Mmm.

1023
00:59:42,613 --> 00:59:44,646
Just not like
taking it for granted.

1024
00:59:44,648 --> 00:59:47,182
- Can you please hold still?
- -I'm trying.

1025
00:59:47,184 --> 00:59:48,951
- But...
- -Okay, get comfortable.

1026
00:59:48,953 --> 00:59:50,686
It's in your fucking face
right now, so if you want...

1027
00:59:50,688 --> 00:59:54,923
- I'm getting comfortable, but this...
- I want a break anyway, okay.

1028
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:56,925
The toilet is more uncomfortable
than that needle.

1029
00:59:56,927 --> 01:00:00,529
- Okay, okay.
- Okay, I'm good.

1030
01:00:00,531 --> 01:00:02,831
- You ready to start again?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

1031
01:00:02,833 --> 01:00:05,067
- Okay.
- -Okay.

1032
01:00:05,069 --> 01:00:07,836
I'm so grateful for this, by the way.
Did I tell you that already?

1033
01:00:07,838 --> 01:00:09,871
- Yeah, you did.
- Okay, good.

1034
01:00:09,873 --> 01:00:11,440
You might not be
when you see it.

1035
01:00:11,442 --> 01:00:13,709
- Really? Can you please make it look good?
- Please just stay still.

1036
01:00:13,711 --> 01:00:15,243
I need one of those sexy scars.

1037
01:00:17,547 --> 01:00:21,149
- So you have to come back and see
me in seven to ten days... -Okay.

1038
01:00:21,151 --> 01:00:25,020
- ...so I can take out the stitches.
- Okay.

1039
01:00:26,522 --> 01:00:28,256
Lee, how are you?

1040
01:00:28,258 --> 01:00:30,158
Good. Hungry.

1041
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:32,761
Hungry?

1042
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:34,963
Yeah, I'm starving.

1043
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:36,365
- You have anything?
- -No.

1044
01:00:36,367 --> 01:00:38,000
We'll go get something.

1045
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:46,742
- <i> Can't find your...</i>
- -<i> One week.</i>

1046
01:00:46,744 --> 01:00:49,244
- It was nice to meet you.
- You too.

1047
01:00:49,246 --> 01:00:50,545
Sorry I didn't have any food.

1048
01:00:51,715 --> 01:00:54,316
Okay.

1049
01:00:56,653 --> 01:00:58,086
All right.

1050
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:05,340
Fingers crossed.

1051
01:01:46,603 --> 01:01:48,370
Hah!

1052
01:01:48,372 --> 01:01:49,604
No, don't shoot!

1053
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:08,724
No!

1054
01:02:08,726 --> 01:02:11,727
Shit! Shit!

1055
01:02:16,866 --> 01:02:18,100
No!

1056
01:02:24,742 --> 01:02:26,174
How do you like your steak?

1057
01:02:26,976 --> 01:02:28,477
Medium well.

1058
01:02:28,479 --> 01:02:31,146
Medium well. Medium well.

1059
01:02:59,476 --> 01:03:01,843
So I go on in what turns out
to be a bit of a boys' trip.

1060
01:03:01,845 --> 01:03:04,028
I was thinking it was
the last thing I need,

1061
01:03:04,054 --> 01:03:06,114
but I end up on this
big boy's trip and...

1062
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:09,317
Meaning that you were going to
get all drunk and everything.

1063
01:03:09,319 --> 01:03:12,087
- We would get all drunk and get into all
sorts of trouble. -This is really good.

1064
01:03:12,089 --> 01:03:14,823
Is it? It's not overcooked?

1065
01:03:14,825 --> 01:03:16,258
It's perfect.

1066
01:03:52,229 --> 01:03:57,265
I think I have an easier time with
spiritual desire than earthly desire.

1067
01:03:57,267 --> 01:03:58,533
Is that possible?

1068
01:04:00,269 --> 01:04:03,104
- Yeah, of course.
- That I'm more comfortable...

1069
01:04:03,106 --> 01:04:05,407
- With earthly desire, with
spiritual desire... -No.

1070
01:04:05,409 --> 01:04:08,276
Yeah, of course. Well, you would be
because that's what we aspire to.

1071
01:04:08,278 --> 01:04:12,080
The earthly desires lead to
spiritual desires hopefully.

1072
01:04:12,082 --> 01:04:14,416
- You can start... -But I think
I'm trying to bypass it.

1073
01:04:14,418 --> 01:04:17,919
- Do you? -Yeah, I think I
try to not experience...

1074
01:04:17,921 --> 01:04:19,754
I think you should
experience them.

1075
01:04:19,756 --> 01:04:22,624
Like, I think my appetite
is so ravenous.

1076
01:04:22,626 --> 01:04:23,758
Mm-hmm.

1077
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,460
- Why?
- I love that.

1078
01:04:25,462 --> 01:04:31,867
Oh. I think it is that maybe I think
it might, like, overwhelm the system.

1079
01:04:31,869 --> 01:04:36,571
Your appetite is so ravenous. Well, it was
certainly the way you attacked that steak.

1080
01:04:36,573 --> 01:04:38,306
Well, it was a big steak.

1081
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:57,092
<i>Boy, she is a beautiful girl.</i>

1082
01:04:57,094 --> 01:04:59,261
<i>You gonna smack that hippy ass?</i>

1083
01:04:59,263 --> 01:05:00,829
Hey, what are you doing here?

1084
01:05:00,831 --> 01:05:03,698
Hey, dude, she's fine,
fine as wine.

1085
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:05,333
Get out of here. Come here.

1086
01:05:05,335 --> 01:05:06,334
Hey, get out of town.

1087
01:05:06,336 --> 01:05:09,204
- Get out of here.
- -Hey! Get high.

1088
01:05:09,206 --> 01:05:11,172
- Where are you going? Come on.
- Oh, no.

1089
01:05:11,174 --> 01:05:13,742
Okay, hey, I'm gonna go...
Max, one sec, come back.

1090
01:05:13,744 --> 01:05:15,310
I might crash out
on that hammock.

1091
01:05:15,312 --> 01:05:18,513
Find me in a couple of hours.
The hammock's perfect.

1092
01:05:18,515 --> 01:05:20,148
- Max.
- Yes.

1093
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:23,285
- Please do not tell me
you're leaving. -Yeah.

1094
01:05:23,287 --> 01:05:25,754
This has been nice.
We are having a blast.

1095
01:05:25,756 --> 01:05:28,690
Hey, Tim, what's going on?
Hey! Hey!

1096
01:05:28,692 --> 01:05:30,959
I'll just have one beer
and I'll get out of your hair.

1097
01:05:30,961 --> 01:05:33,895
- Hey, I'm gonna get rid of him.
- You look great in that dress.

1098
01:05:33,897 --> 01:05:35,530
- What? -I'm gonna
get rid of him.

1099
01:05:35,532 --> 01:05:37,132
- It's not about him. -Then
we can keep hanging.

1100
01:05:37,134 --> 01:05:38,400
- It's not even about him.
- I know.

1101
01:05:38,402 --> 01:05:40,201
<i>That felt like</i>
<i>an accusation of sorts.</i>

1102
01:05:40,203 --> 01:05:43,738
No, why are you here? Where's Tim?
What's he doing?

1103
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:47,175
Um... Hopefully,
he's doing our taxes.

1104
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:51,947
I don't know what he's doing.
Probably has some guys over.

1105
01:05:51,949 --> 01:05:54,349
Eating pizza, drinking beers.

1106
01:05:54,351 --> 01:05:57,185
We're house-sitting in this amazing house.
He may be swimming in the pool.

1107
01:05:57,187 --> 01:05:59,087
<i>Well, hey,</i>
<i>if you're really gonna go,</i>

1108
01:05:59,089 --> 01:06:01,122
do you mind if I get
the dress back?

1109
01:06:01,124 --> 01:06:02,891
But she looks great in it.

1110
01:06:02,893 --> 01:06:05,493
- I know, you look beautiful, I
just need it back. -Thank you.

1111
01:06:05,495 --> 01:06:06,928
Can I just wear it for
one more night?

1112
01:06:06,930 --> 01:06:10,765
No, obviously, you know,
my wife will be here.

1113
01:06:10,767 --> 01:06:12,667
That would be tough to explain.

1114
01:06:12,669 --> 01:06:15,603
I don't... Honestly, I don't even wanna
deal with it, you know what I mean?

1115
01:06:15,605 --> 01:06:17,305
Oh, yeah.

1116
01:06:17,307 --> 01:06:20,141
<i>Like, I'm really</i>
<i>nervous right now.</i>

1117
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:22,811
Like, just talking on the subject,
and I don't even know you.

1118
01:06:22,813 --> 01:06:24,980
- I have that effect on people.
- And I'll never see you again.

1119
01:06:24,982 --> 01:06:26,414
- Really?
- Yeah.

1120
01:06:26,416 --> 01:06:28,616
- Oh, you're so sure?
- I've already committed to that.

1121
01:06:28,618 --> 01:06:30,285
Ray, why did you do that?

1122
01:06:30,287 --> 01:06:32,387
I was just trying to help you out, man.
Did I embarrass you?

1123
01:06:32,389 --> 01:06:34,155
It's a fucking dick move, man.

1124
01:06:34,157 --> 01:06:36,257
Sorry, was it? You're showing
off in front of the broad?

1125
01:06:36,259 --> 01:06:39,361
I wasn't showing off. We were having fun.
It was kind of a dick move, dude.

1126
01:06:39,363 --> 01:06:41,896
It's, like, funny when Tango was here.
It wasn't funny right now.

1127
01:06:41,898 --> 01:06:46,868
Sometimes you gotta know when to not
do the fucking, you know, Ray Show.

1128
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:48,636
- That's very liberating.
- What?

1129
01:06:48,638 --> 01:06:50,238
Well, we're never gonna see
each other again.

1130
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:52,140
- It is, right?
- Yeah, I love that.

1131
01:06:52,908 --> 01:06:54,075
Mm-hmm.

1132
01:06:54,077 --> 01:06:55,610
That I can embrace.

1133
01:06:55,612 --> 01:06:56,778
<i>Good night.</i>

1134
01:06:56,780 --> 01:06:58,613
Goodbye, Mrs. Ray.

1135
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:02,817
What's that from?

1136
01:07:02,819 --> 01:07:06,254
How much do I have to pay you to
please leave my fucking house?

1137
01:07:06,822 --> 01:07:08,323
A lot of money.

1138
01:07:08,325 --> 01:07:10,892
I love you, man.
I just wanna hang out, dude.

1139
01:07:10,894 --> 01:07:12,727
I just wanna hang out, come on.

1140
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:15,030
Come on, bro.

1141
01:07:15,032 --> 01:07:17,432
Oh, my-fucking-God.

1142
01:07:17,434 --> 01:07:21,436
What's wrong? What, are you uptight?
What do you got over there, taxes?

1143
01:07:21,438 --> 01:07:24,105
- You gotta decide whether...
- Shut up, Ray!

1144
01:07:24,107 --> 01:07:26,641
Shut up? No!
I'm not gonna shut up!

1145
01:07:26,643 --> 01:07:29,644
You shut up! Fuck you, man!

1146
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:36,618
You want me outta here,
I'll get the fuck outta here.

1147
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:37,900
Fuck you.

1148
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:07,849
I think I know people
that are happy.

1149
01:08:09,018 --> 01:08:11,719
The qualifier of insanely

1150
01:08:11,721 --> 01:08:15,723
is the one that's a little
tricky, you know what I mean?

1151
01:08:18,227 --> 01:08:20,662
- Just everyday happy.
- Hmm?

1152
01:08:20,664 --> 01:08:23,731
Just everyday happy,
forget the "insanely" bit.

1153
01:08:23,733 --> 01:08:26,034
Be consistently happy.

1154
01:08:26,036 --> 01:08:27,368
Mm-hmm.

1155
01:08:31,974 --> 01:08:36,377
You've thought about it, undoubtedly.
Or dealing with it, unable to.

1156
01:08:38,814 --> 01:08:40,148
Um...

1157
01:09:47,483 --> 01:09:49,817
Thank you
for a really good night.

1158
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:51,853
Sorry about your...

1159
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:53,721
Thank you.

1160
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:00,380
- You wanna take this with you?
- No.

1161
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:56,411
Oh!

1162
01:12:36,885 --> 01:12:38,052
Huh.

1163
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:51,733
Oh, fuck me.

1164
01:13:20,162 --> 01:13:21,562
Oh.

1165
01:13:42,786 --> 01:13:46,287
Oh, care... Care...
The tide's coming in.

1166
01:13:46,289 --> 01:13:47,822
- Hey!
- I know.

1167
01:13:47,824 --> 01:13:52,360
Sorry. Come here.
Do you wanna see something?

1168
01:13:52,362 --> 01:13:55,029
- Yeah. -I mean, I know I
don't know you, but...

1169
01:13:56,698 --> 01:13:59,467
You gotta...
Have you seen Saturn?

1170
01:13:59,469 --> 01:14:01,437
Okay, wait, wait. Did you
ever look through...

1171
01:14:01,463 --> 01:14:03,237
Just don't touch it
because it's lined up,

1172
01:14:03,239 --> 01:14:07,475
and just look through the, just look
through there and see what you can see.

1173
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:10,972
Can you see?

1174
01:14:12,247 --> 01:14:15,883
- Oh, my God!
- -Right?

1175
01:14:15,885 --> 01:14:17,785
- Yeah.
- And you can see the rings.

1176
01:14:17,787 --> 01:14:19,067
I know.

1177
01:14:20,255 --> 01:14:22,190
Which one is it?

1178
01:14:22,192 --> 01:14:26,294
I know, you can't even see, but then you
just look through there and there it is.

1179
01:14:26,296 --> 01:14:28,329
I mean, this is like...

1180
01:14:28,331 --> 01:14:31,566
Isn't it just
the most perfect...

1181
01:18:16,559 --> 01:18:18,259
I think we should get
a telescope.

1182
01:18:18,261 --> 01:18:19,593
Oh, that could be neat.

1183
01:18:19,595 --> 01:18:21,295
- Right?
- Yeah.

1184
01:18:24,466 --> 01:18:26,734
I might wanna try
ayahuasca together.

1185
01:18:27,235 --> 01:18:28,836
Really?

1186
01:18:29,805 --> 01:18:32,039
I think we should go
pick up our child.

1187
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:34,608
Me too. But can we get breakfast
first, just the two of us?

1188
01:18:34,610 --> 01:18:38,145
Oh, yeah, let's get breakfast first.
Let me just text my mom.

1189
01:18:38,147 --> 01:18:40,014
He'll be okay
with Grandma and Pop-pop.

1190
01:18:40,016 --> 01:18:42,883
He'll be great.
They'll spoil him.

1191
01:18:42,885 --> 01:18:45,486
Did you guys miss me at all or
did you guys just had a blast?

1192
01:18:45,488 --> 01:18:47,555
No, we did. I missed you.

1193
01:18:47,557 --> 01:18:48,856
- I missed you too.
- Oh, yeah.

1194
01:18:48,858 --> 01:18:50,291
I'm not the same
without you guys.

1195
01:18:50,293 --> 01:18:54,061
- Yeah, me neither. I've discovered.
- Good.

1196
01:18:54,063 --> 01:18:58,499
Can we be bad parents and
let Jude watch cartoons?

1197
01:18:58,501 --> 01:19:00,501
Climb back in bed.

1198
01:19:00,503 --> 01:19:02,623
I think I'm gonna open a
bottle of wine at about noon.

1199
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:05,606
I love you.

1200
01:19:05,608 --> 01:19:07,041
I love you too.
