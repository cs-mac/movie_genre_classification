1
00:00:40,789 --> 00:00:44,453
When do you stop
looking at each other?

2
00:00:45,334 --> 00:00:48,001
Shouldn't there be a warning?

3
00:00:48,183 --> 00:00:49,430
Shouldn't somebody say to us,

4
00:00:49,527 --> 00:00:52,308
"Hey, watch out, pay attention"?

5
00:00:52,404 --> 00:00:54,915
Because you can be thinking,

6
00:00:55,251 --> 00:00:58,224
"I'm okay, we're okay,
we're good."

7
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,980
Then you turn around and...
a distance between you.

8
00:01:58,707 --> 00:01:59,839
Zorany! Miro!

9
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:08,480
I've got a little job for you.

10
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:19,950
The Speed Merchants?

11
00:02:20,045 --> 00:02:21,963
I'm sorry, I apologize.
Traffic.

12
00:02:22,068 --> 00:02:24,657
Yeah, bad traffic
for three days?

13
00:02:24,753 --> 00:02:25,807
Hi, Bea.

14
00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:27,727
Hi, Dad.

15
00:02:28,044 --> 00:02:29,251
Very exciting.

16
00:02:36,203 --> 00:02:37,134
Okay, Bea.

17
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:38,573
- No, I want...
- Stop with the balloon.

18
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:40,030
No, stop, stop.

19
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,185
Who's that?

20
00:02:44,106 --> 00:02:45,296
- That's one of the cleaners.
- Yeah.

21
00:02:45,391 --> 00:02:46,321
It's the cleaner, yeah.

22
00:02:46,418 --> 00:02:47,338
Yeah, you know her...
Erika.

23
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:48,335
She's staggering.

24
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,774
Staggering.
Why do you have a picture

25
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,376
of one of the cleaners
on your computer?

26
00:02:51,472 --> 00:02:52,747
I was just experimenting
with my camera.

27
00:02:52,843 --> 00:02:54,253
I was just, um, you know,

28
00:02:54,348 --> 00:02:57,244
"Can I just?
Oh, that's good."

29
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:06,824
Come on.

30
00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:08,972
It's all right for you, mate,

31
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:09,931
you've got a gorgeous,
Swedish wife.

32
00:03:10,028 --> 00:03:10,891
Girlfriend.

33
00:03:10,988 --> 00:03:12,108
Half Swedish.

34
00:03:12,205 --> 00:03:16,021
You cannot say girlfriend
after ten years.

35
00:03:17,968 --> 00:03:19,253
You all right?

36
00:03:26,475 --> 00:03:27,501
I mean, isn't that true?

37
00:03:27,596 --> 00:03:29,264
You've been there,

38
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:30,856
are you gassed in Sweden
if you're ugly?

39
00:03:30,952 --> 00:03:32,526
Or maybe just given a penis,

40
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:35,143
because some of the men
can be very ugly,

41
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,878
but I've never seen
an ugly Swedish woman.

42
00:03:36,974 --> 00:03:38,720
Jesus, look at Liv.

43
00:04:08,622 --> 00:04:10,281
Oh, I love this space.

44
00:04:10,377 --> 00:04:14,960
We do. We think it's
a steal. Thanks for coming.

45
00:05:40,742 --> 00:05:42,718
That's us. Let's go!

46
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:44,409
Are we crazy?

47
00:06:45,665 --> 00:06:46,720
No.

48
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:48,515
About what?

49
00:06:48,803 --> 00:06:50,010
King's Cross.

50
00:06:50,404 --> 00:06:52,129
Sandy still thinks we're
crazy to move there.

51
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:54,124
It's so... the area.

52
00:06:54,334 --> 00:06:55,773
It's a great office, isn't it?

53
00:06:55,869 --> 00:06:57,020
And it was a...

54
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,853
It's a great project,
it was a great night.

55
00:06:58,948 --> 00:06:59,812
I don't know.

56
00:06:59,907 --> 00:07:01,345
It's all great.

57
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:03,427
Thank you for making
an effort tonight.

58
00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:04,837
The launch,
I know it's not your...

59
00:07:04,932 --> 00:07:06,496
but it really helped.

60
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,839
It's okay. It's fine.

61
00:07:07,934 --> 00:07:09,525
Was it an effort?

62
00:07:11,262 --> 00:07:12,854
What? That's her.

63
00:07:13,382 --> 00:07:14,437
That's Bea.

64
00:07:14,724 --> 00:07:15,712
No, that's a fox.

65
00:07:15,808 --> 00:07:17,217
No, it's her,
she was exhausted.

66
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:21,092
They're taking over London.
I hate that noise.

67
00:07:21,188 --> 00:07:22,473
It's so late.

68
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,301
How can she just not sleep?

69
00:07:27,325 --> 00:07:29,569
I don't think going
to her always...

70
00:07:29,665 --> 00:07:31,555
I don't know if that helps.

71
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,319
I know you don't.

72
00:07:33,664 --> 00:07:35,323
Let's go back and see someone.

73
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:38,008
I've seen too many someones.

74
00:07:38,593 --> 00:07:39,648
Sorry.

75
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:41,153
I'm sorry.

76
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:45,824
Listen, what you're doing,
the whole project, for London,

77
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,114
the office, everything...
it's wonderful.

78
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:52,344
I think it can genuinely
be something...

79
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:53,371
Rubbish.

80
00:07:53,468 --> 00:07:56,411
- Terrible.
- ...genuinely rubbish-like.

81
00:07:56,506 --> 00:07:57,561
Crap.

82
00:08:01,532 --> 00:08:02,970
I'll come back.

83
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:12,551
Down, hold...

84
00:08:14,842 --> 00:08:16,282
one, two, three.

85
00:08:18,363 --> 00:08:20,338
Turn, one, two, three.

86
00:08:23,742 --> 00:08:26,620
Bea, darling, it's 3:30
in the morning.

87
00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:27,838
We have to stop this.

88
00:08:27,934 --> 00:08:28,989
One, two...

89
00:08:32,574 --> 00:08:33,629
Hello?

90
00:08:33,984 --> 00:08:37,342
Yeah, well, no, I mean,
I'm his partner, so...

91
00:08:37,437 --> 00:08:38,491
Yes, I am.

92
00:08:38,971 --> 00:08:40,025
What?!

93
00:08:40,381 --> 00:08:41,436
Hi.

94
00:08:42,202 --> 00:08:43,449
Officer, this place
is my business.

95
00:08:43,546 --> 00:08:44,638
Go on, go ahead.

96
00:08:44,735 --> 00:08:45,942
- My partner's in there already.
- Okay.

97
00:08:46,049 --> 00:08:50,527
I had everything on that laptop,
my life is on that laptop.

98
00:08:50,623 --> 00:08:51,707
I'm very sorry, sir.

99
00:08:51,802 --> 00:08:52,858
Will! Will!

100
00:08:52,953 --> 00:08:55,350
All the computers, my laptop,
the petty cash...

101
00:08:55,446 --> 00:08:56,539
Well, how did they get in?

102
00:08:56,635 --> 00:08:57,661
Through the roof.

103
00:08:57,756 --> 00:08:59,225
- What about the alarm?
- They turned it off.

104
00:08:59,322 --> 00:09:00,607
Well, how do they know
the code?

105
00:09:00,702 --> 00:09:01,784
I wasn't here.
I don't know.

106
00:09:01,881 --> 00:09:02,974
- Jesus Christ.
- Do you have cleaners?

107
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,729
It's not the cleaners.

108
00:09:04,825 --> 00:09:07,108
This is covered in glass.

109
00:09:07,222 --> 00:09:08,987
It's not the cleaners.

110
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:10,590
I know it's...
I know the cleaners.

111
00:09:10,685 --> 00:09:12,957
How can we have a break-in
on our first day?

112
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:18,251
Unless the cleaners have turned
into a bunch of acrobats.

113
00:09:21,465 --> 00:09:22,328
Who is it?

114
00:09:22,424 --> 00:09:24,322
It's Zoran and Miro.

115
00:09:36,788 --> 00:09:37,997
- Hey.
- Hey.

116
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:45,055
How's my best nephew, hmm?

117
00:09:45,275 --> 00:09:46,522
- Dragan.
- Huh?

118
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,670
See my hands? See his?

119
00:09:50,905 --> 00:09:51,767
Uh-huh.

120
00:09:51,863 --> 00:09:54,376
His dad had the big brains.

121
00:09:54,684 --> 00:09:56,583
I had the big hands.

122
00:09:57,177 --> 00:10:00,379
Your dad had hands
like a girl's.

123
00:10:02,066 --> 00:10:04,273
And the girls loved him.

124
00:10:05,175 --> 00:10:06,489
It's the same with you two.

125
00:10:06,585 --> 00:10:08,943
My son is the clumsy one.

126
00:10:15,733 --> 00:10:17,248
This is for you.

127
00:10:18,456 --> 00:10:19,819
Wipe everything.

128
00:10:20,374 --> 00:10:21,622
You know how to do that?

129
00:10:21,718 --> 00:10:22,706
Erase everything?

130
00:10:22,811 --> 00:10:25,044
They'll be delivering
new computers,

131
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:29,496
and then you can go back in,
my little monkey.

132
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,138
Hi, Mom.

133
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,120
How was school?

134
00:10:51,226 --> 00:10:52,357
It was okay.

135
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,131
Lots of homework?

136
00:10:54,227 --> 00:10:55,589
No, not really.

137
00:10:56,116 --> 00:10:57,171
Not really?

138
00:10:59,953 --> 00:11:01,007
Mirsad,

139
00:11:01,813 --> 00:11:04,307
you've not been
at school for weeks.

140
00:11:04,402 --> 00:11:06,003
They sent another letter.

141
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:07,442
It's a mistake... half the time

142
00:11:07,537 --> 00:11:12,199
they don't know who's there
and who's not there.

143
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,232
Now we have
to go back to see people

144
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:19,381
at the Social Services.

145
00:11:19,861 --> 00:11:20,916
We survived.

146
00:11:22,642 --> 00:11:24,234
Do you understand?

147
00:11:25,806 --> 00:11:26,862
We survived,

148
00:11:27,409 --> 00:11:29,308
and that's not free.

149
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,120
I didn't ask to survive.

150
00:11:31,216 --> 00:11:32,962
Imagine your father.

151
00:11:33,844 --> 00:11:36,117
If we could offer him
just one day,

152
00:11:36,212 --> 00:11:38,110
one hour... imagine...

153
00:11:38,771 --> 00:11:41,102
You have a life and you are
throwing it away.

154
00:11:41,198 --> 00:11:42,897
I don't even remember him.

155
00:11:42,992 --> 00:11:44,968
I don't remember him.

156
00:11:45,591 --> 00:11:47,105
Where do you go?

157
00:11:47,317 --> 00:11:48,784
Where do you go every day?

158
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,031
I'm working, I'm earning money.

159
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:51,469
You have to go to school.

160
00:11:51,574 --> 00:11:52,918
That's what we promised,

161
00:11:53,014 --> 00:11:54,193
with police and the court.

162
00:11:54,288 --> 00:11:55,794
Otherwise, they'll
put you in prison.

163
00:11:55,891 --> 00:11:57,395
I'll be 16 in three months.

164
00:11:57,492 --> 00:11:58,547
Mirsad...

165
00:12:00,369 --> 00:12:01,423
You're a clever boy.

166
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,379
You're clever,
you've got a brain.

167
00:12:03,476 --> 00:12:05,519
I have to go. I'm late.

168
00:12:05,615 --> 00:12:08,338
If somebody,
if one of his family,

169
00:12:08,434 --> 00:12:10,322
if any of our people are
leading you, I'm telling you,

170
00:12:10,418 --> 00:12:12,557
if anyone of them is,
I'll kill them!

171
00:12:12,653 --> 00:12:14,553
And I wouldn't care!

172
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:57,572
We've never really
had a proper diagnosis,

173
00:12:57,803 --> 00:13:00,047
but I've always known
Bea was special.

174
00:13:00,142 --> 00:13:01,198
Yeah!

175
00:13:01,773 --> 00:13:04,555
She's double happy, double sad,
double excited, double awake,

176
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:09,004
double needy... well, no,
triple needy, actually.

177
00:13:11,728 --> 00:13:12,907
I know even...

178
00:13:13,003 --> 00:13:14,412
even when Bea
was ten months old,

179
00:13:14,509 --> 00:13:17,932
she, she was... already
distressed by noise.

180
00:13:18,027 --> 00:13:21,452
Sh-She would only sleep with
a particular blanket next to her

181
00:13:21,547 --> 00:13:24,462
or-or eat
with a particular spoon.

182
00:13:24,558 --> 00:13:27,789
Lately it's been getting worse
and she can't sleep at all.

183
00:13:27,886 --> 00:13:30,543
She can't manage at school,
where, uh...

184
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,762
all of us, just completely
at our wits' end.

185
00:13:34,924 --> 00:13:37,822
I can't, I'm sorry, I'm late.

186
00:13:49,866 --> 00:13:51,592
...eat foods of a certain color.

187
00:13:51,688 --> 00:13:52,744
Sorry.

188
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,535
Sorry.

189
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:01,816
I'm Rosemary McCloud.

190
00:14:02,476 --> 00:14:03,725
Hi, Rosemary.
I'm Will.

191
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,951
Where's Bea?

192
00:14:05,066 --> 00:14:06,351
Oh, no, Bea...

193
00:14:06,476 --> 00:14:08,461
No, the structure is
that before I begin

194
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:09,996
any sort of diagnosis,

195
00:14:10,091 --> 00:14:12,134
I'd like to meet
the parents first, alone.

196
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,361
Right, great.

197
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:16,938
So I'm just, uh,
finishing with Liv.

198
00:14:17,035 --> 00:14:18,089
Um...

199
00:14:18,349 --> 00:14:21,388
Well, I'd like to, uh, listen
to these documentaries.

200
00:14:21,483 --> 00:14:23,430
I must have heard them
in the past.

201
00:14:23,527 --> 00:14:25,158
Uh, no, they're mostly
World Service.

202
00:14:25,263 --> 00:14:28,101
Liv explained that she's going
to semi-retire until Bea gets...

203
00:14:28,197 --> 00:14:29,098
That's not true.

204
00:14:29,194 --> 00:14:31,112
- Effectively.
- Will...

205
00:14:31,207 --> 00:14:33,384
It's, it's either
Bea's gymnastics,

206
00:14:33,481 --> 00:14:34,343
Bea's art therapy,

207
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,629
Bea's music therapy,

208
00:14:35,725 --> 00:14:37,164
it's a sacrifice
is all I'm saying.

209
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:39,944
Liv won prizes for the work
she did, did she tell you that?

210
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:42,314
It's a big sacrifice
is all I'm saying, hmm.

211
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,753
I was just explaining
to Rosemary...

212
00:14:43,848 --> 00:14:45,259
She's up all night.

213
00:14:45,353 --> 00:14:48,902
...that, um, in these past few
months, that Bea's gotten worse.

214
00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:50,284
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

215
00:14:50,831 --> 00:14:55,413
And, uh, she's not sleeping,
and... it's intense.

216
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,475
Yes.

217
00:14:58,090 --> 00:14:59,461
Hav-Have either
of you... therapy...

218
00:14:59,557 --> 00:15:00,842
have either of you considered

219
00:15:00,938 --> 00:15:02,884
ever-ever thought
about doing that or?

220
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,198
I did see someone.

221
00:15:04,294 --> 00:15:05,348
When?

222
00:15:05,512 --> 00:15:08,773
For a while,
'cause I can get low sometimes.

223
00:15:08,869 --> 00:15:10,661
- I just go into low...
- Wow.

224
00:15:10,758 --> 00:15:12,426
Um, my father died
and my mother died

225
00:15:12,522 --> 00:15:13,865
- and my sister died and...
- Hmm.

226
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,962
It's family with
a short life expectancy.

227
00:15:17,068 --> 00:15:19,273
And a grandmother of 93.

228
00:15:19,465 --> 00:15:21,738
And a grandmother
of 93.

229
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:27,337
But some days the cup is empty
and some days its 93% full.

230
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,227
Were you, um, were you
brought up in Sweden or?

231
00:15:33,322 --> 00:15:37,637
Oh, my father was American,
and I went to university there.

232
00:15:37,733 --> 00:15:38,693
- Uh-huh.
- Chicago.

233
00:15:38,788 --> 00:15:40,304
Addicted to cold.

234
00:15:41,225 --> 00:15:42,280
No.

235
00:15:45,348 --> 00:15:48,245
Uh, are you concerned about Bea?

236
00:15:48,868 --> 00:15:51,533
Sure, you know, but Liv is...

237
00:15:53,002 --> 00:15:57,097
Liv worries so much, there's,
there's not much room... for...

238
00:15:57,192 --> 00:15:59,014
You know,
but a 13-year-old girl

239
00:15:59,109 --> 00:16:00,836
who collects batteries,

240
00:16:00,931 --> 00:16:06,207
doesn't sleep, doesn't let us
sleep, won't eat anything,

241
00:16:06,792 --> 00:16:08,901
spends all day wanting
to do somersaults, I mean,

242
00:16:08,997 --> 00:16:10,310
yeah, sure, I'm concerned.

243
00:16:10,407 --> 00:16:11,586
Of course I'm concerned.

244
00:16:11,682 --> 00:16:15,959
Liv says that you're wrapped up
in your work.

245
00:16:16,294 --> 00:16:18,423
Wrapped up?
Wrapped up?

246
00:16:19,392 --> 00:16:20,524
That's fair.

247
00:16:21,157 --> 00:16:22,691
I love how working hard,
working really hard,

248
00:16:22,787 --> 00:16:24,744
becomes wrapped up,
becomes something selfish.

249
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:25,702
I love that.

250
00:16:25,797 --> 00:16:28,225
When you say that you love it,

251
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,753
do you mean
that you don't love it?

252
00:16:33,508 --> 00:16:34,688
Let's just back up.

253
00:16:34,783 --> 00:16:35,916
We love Bea.

254
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:39,070
It's not a competition to see
who loves her the most.

255
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:42,916
If it were a competition,
I would happily let Liv win.

256
00:16:43,011 --> 00:16:44,067
You win.

257
00:16:48,861 --> 00:16:51,326
It says here your father
died, your husband,

258
00:16:51,423 --> 00:16:52,478
your sister.

259
00:16:53,927 --> 00:16:55,901
This was where? Sarajevo?

260
00:16:56,006 --> 00:16:59,325
Um, Miro and I left
with the Red Cross.

261
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:02,864
My husband stayed
behind and was, uh,

262
00:17:03,391 --> 00:17:06,143
he stayed behind
and was murdered.

263
00:17:06,239 --> 00:17:07,447
You're Serbs?

264
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,891
My husband was Serb.
I'm Muslim.

265
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:12,645
Uh, it's complicated.

266
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:15,234
We're Bosnian,
we're all Bosnian...

267
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:16,673
It's complicated.

268
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,686
Do you have
relatives in Britain?

269
00:17:18,783 --> 00:17:20,604
My husband's family.

270
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,872
His brother, sisters and aunt.

271
00:17:26,273 --> 00:17:28,353
Was a time when
a smack around the ear

272
00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:30,971
or my auntie would
give me a thump.

273
00:17:31,076 --> 00:17:33,762
Matter of fact, she punctured
my eardrum at one point,

274
00:17:33,858 --> 00:17:35,038
but you knew where you were.

275
00:17:35,133 --> 00:17:36,285
Simple, we're all simple.

276
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,739
What about you, Sonny Jim?

277
00:17:38,979 --> 00:17:41,252
What have you been up to while
you've not been at school?

278
00:17:41,348 --> 00:17:44,474
Back thieving,
stealing again? Hmm?

279
00:17:46,017 --> 00:17:48,348
See, things are not things.

280
00:17:48,444 --> 00:17:51,725
Things are always
somebody's things.

281
00:17:51,935 --> 00:17:54,754
Car is Jack's car,
'cause he worked for it.

282
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:57,315
Your Prada jacket is little
Kevin's Prada jacket,

283
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,700
before it was his... I can see
your little brain ticking over.

284
00:18:00,797 --> 00:18:03,645
His Prada jacket
belonged to Mr. Prada.

285
00:18:03,741 --> 00:18:05,793
What about before that?

286
00:18:06,272 --> 00:18:07,328
Before what?

287
00:18:07,807 --> 00:18:10,241
Before it was Mr. Prada's?

288
00:18:11,105 --> 00:18:13,724
Did it belong to the women
who made it?

289
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,722
'Cause my mom does that...
makes clothes for other people,

290
00:18:17,817 --> 00:18:19,391
slaves for other people.

291
00:18:19,487 --> 00:18:21,184
Or like when prisoners
make trains.

292
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,418
Next time you're going down.

293
00:18:23,514 --> 00:18:24,705
We'll catch you,

294
00:18:24,801 --> 00:18:26,689
and then you can discuss
who owns the trains

295
00:18:26,784 --> 00:18:28,607
with your cell mates.

296
00:18:28,703 --> 00:18:30,295
Back in a minute.

297
00:18:37,372 --> 00:18:39,424
Sorry I'm late again,
but everything is here.

298
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,633
- All the Macs. Everything
- It's okay.

299
00:18:40,728 --> 00:18:42,588
- Excellent. Thank you.
- Thank you.

300
00:18:42,683 --> 00:18:43,998
Excuse me.
You dropped this.

301
00:18:44,094 --> 00:18:45,685
Oh, thanks, Erika.

302
00:18:52,312 --> 00:18:55,161
Oh, please, come up, Erika.
It is Erika, isn't it?

303
00:18:55,257 --> 00:18:57,080
- Yes, sir.
- Sandy.

304
00:19:03,418 --> 00:19:05,088
We set the alarm, sir.

305
00:19:05,183 --> 00:19:06,621
I did it myself.

306
00:19:06,717 --> 00:19:07,744
You have my word.

307
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:09,019
I'm not accusing you.

308
00:19:09,116 --> 00:19:11,129
The police have already
called my mobile phone,

309
00:19:11,225 --> 00:19:12,376
asking me questions.

310
00:19:12,471 --> 00:19:13,335
Yeah, that is normal.

311
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,782
About this thing
and then that thing.

312
00:19:14,878 --> 00:19:15,740
I'm so sorry.

313
00:19:15,837 --> 00:19:16,700
It was like Kafka.

314
00:19:16,796 --> 00:19:17,918
"Where did you get your car?"

315
00:19:18,014 --> 00:19:19,837
"Why are you ordering takeaway?"

316
00:19:19,932 --> 00:19:21,688
You know, we try
to do a good job.

317
00:19:21,783 --> 00:19:24,411
You-you do, you do do
a very good job.

318
00:19:24,506 --> 00:19:25,715
Erika, listen.

319
00:19:26,395 --> 00:19:29,081
We have to have a new code
for the alarm.

320
00:19:29,176 --> 00:19:30,903
Now, we're going to give you
your own code,

321
00:19:30,999 --> 00:19:32,312
You're going to choose it,
not us,

322
00:19:32,408 --> 00:19:33,655
so there's absolutely no way

323
00:19:33,751 --> 00:19:35,286
of you being wrongly accused
of anything.

324
00:19:35,381 --> 00:19:37,079
- Is that a deal?
- Okay, thanks.

325
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:38,229
Oh, listen.

326
00:19:38,326 --> 00:19:41,528
I had your picture
on my computer.

327
00:19:42,621 --> 00:19:44,156
What would the burglar
make of that?

328
00:19:44,253 --> 00:19:45,460
My photograph?

329
00:19:45,595 --> 00:19:47,704
Yeah. Well, from when I was,
um, trying my camera out,

330
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:49,017
if you remember.

331
00:19:49,113 --> 00:19:51,607
So, the burglar, someone
who didn't know the context,

332
00:19:51,704 --> 00:19:54,810
would think you were
a friend or a girlfriend.

333
00:19:54,906 --> 00:19:56,795
I mean, someone standing over
there who couldn't hear us,

334
00:19:56,891 --> 00:19:58,934
what would he make of this?

335
00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:00,247
Well, apart from my uniform.

336
00:20:00,343 --> 00:20:01,686
Of course apart
from the uniform, yeah.

337
00:20:01,782 --> 00:20:06,644
But say, if we were too far away
to see the uniform.

338
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,630
Y-You know? And I could give you
this book, and you know,

339
00:20:08,726 --> 00:20:10,490
for all matey-boy over there
knows, that's a collected works

340
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:11,575
of Franz Kafka,
that's your birthday...

341
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:14,566
- Or the Bible.
- Or the Bible.

342
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,284
Uh...

343
00:20:39,192 --> 00:20:40,852
The model hasn't changed.

344
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:41,811
Of course I know.

345
00:20:41,906 --> 00:20:42,865
Because we'd have to plant...

346
00:20:42,972 --> 00:20:43,891
Why isn't she moving?

347
00:20:43,988 --> 00:20:45,810
You can't take a fish
out of the water.

348
00:20:45,906 --> 00:20:47,027
I have 50 e-mails.

349
00:20:47,123 --> 00:20:48,313
- Why isn't she moving?
- She's dead.

350
00:20:48,409 --> 00:20:50,106
You can't take
a fish out of the water.

351
00:20:50,202 --> 00:20:51,670
- Okay, put her down.
- Darling, listen to Mommy.

352
00:20:51,765 --> 00:20:53,816
No, no, you can't take
a fish out of the water.

353
00:20:53,913 --> 00:20:55,159
No, no, don't
put her back in.

354
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:56,695
You can't take
a fish out of water!

355
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:57,816
She needs water.

356
00:20:57,913 --> 00:20:59,734
Sandy, no, I can't
get to the office.

357
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,527
If you can get
to the office for me.

358
00:21:01,623 --> 00:21:02,899
Well, I can't because
I'm needed here.

359
00:21:02,994 --> 00:21:04,471
You're right, you
can't take a fish out.

360
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:06,073
You can't, but she's dead.
See? She's dead.

361
00:21:06,168 --> 00:21:08,087
You can go? Okay,
that's great. Thank you.

362
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:09,208
- It's okay. We'll bury her.
- I'll speak later.

363
00:21:09,304 --> 00:21:10,772
Okay, this is what
we're going to do.

364
00:21:10,867 --> 00:21:12,565
We're going to put her
in a little box.

365
00:21:12,661 --> 00:21:14,647
Oh, don't cry, darling.

366
00:21:14,743 --> 00:21:15,798
Don't cry.

367
00:21:16,057 --> 00:21:20,257
Come on, we're going
to put her in a box...

368
00:21:28,082 --> 00:21:30,058
New code.
Two, one...

369
00:21:31,353 --> 00:21:32,485
seven, eight.

370
00:21:33,845 --> 00:21:35,974
It's my date of birth.

371
00:22:16,242 --> 00:22:18,370
Now what are you doing?

372
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:20,626
Let's go! Leave it.

373
00:22:22,964 --> 00:22:24,711
Come on, let's go!

374
00:22:25,268 --> 00:22:26,322
Come on!

375
00:22:27,022 --> 00:22:28,230
Get the door!

376
00:22:30,293 --> 00:22:31,345
Oh!

377
00:22:31,663 --> 00:22:32,795
Jesus Christ!

378
00:22:34,003 --> 00:22:35,135
Fucking hell.

379
00:22:39,728 --> 00:22:40,783
Oh...

380
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:56,050
This is brilliant.

381
00:22:56,145 --> 00:22:57,776
You're really going
to do all this, I mean,

382
00:22:57,873 --> 00:22:59,120
put a canal right
through the middle?

383
00:22:59,215 --> 00:23:00,270
Yeah.

384
00:23:01,325 --> 00:23:02,687
It's brilliant.

385
00:23:03,597 --> 00:23:05,572
I'm Bruno Fella, CID.

386
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:06,857
Are you Sandy or Will?

387
00:23:06,963 --> 00:23:07,827
- I'm Will.
- Hello, Will.

388
00:23:07,923 --> 00:23:09,707
- Hi.
- You know what?

389
00:23:09,802 --> 00:23:13,101
I was born right there,
just about there.

390
00:23:13,196 --> 00:23:14,318
I'd have drowned.

391
00:23:14,414 --> 00:23:15,469
Mm.

392
00:23:15,757 --> 00:23:16,620
I love it.

393
00:23:16,716 --> 00:23:17,838
I think it's really nice.

394
00:23:17,935 --> 00:23:21,041
This is Sandy, um,
Hoffman, my partner.

395
00:23:21,136 --> 00:23:22,192
- Sandy.
- Hello.

396
00:23:22,288 --> 00:23:23,151
Detective Bruno Fella, CID.

397
00:23:23,246 --> 00:23:24,303
Hi, Bruno.

398
00:23:24,399 --> 00:23:26,576
I'm just saying this
is a fabulous building.

399
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:27,600
I think it's brilliant.

400
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:28,751
Thank you.

401
00:23:28,848 --> 00:23:30,383
Was it you had
the scrape with the villains?

402
00:23:30,478 --> 00:23:31,946
No, I wouldn't say
it was a scrape.

403
00:23:32,042 --> 00:23:33,068
Well, they scraped my car.

404
00:23:33,164 --> 00:23:34,890
No, I was running late
for the first break-in.

405
00:23:34,986 --> 00:23:36,270
I wasn't quite
prepared for the second.

406
00:23:36,365 --> 00:23:37,325
Well, I get it, completely.

407
00:23:37,421 --> 00:23:39,406
You know,
completely get it, you know?

408
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:40,587
You're, um, disgruntled.

409
00:23:40,682 --> 00:23:42,802
I would be, you know,
putting all that effort

410
00:23:42,897 --> 00:23:44,364
into making such a fabulous
building, you know,

411
00:23:44,459 --> 00:23:45,965
in an off-style community.

412
00:23:46,062 --> 00:23:47,787
You know, you don't
need the grief, do you?

413
00:23:47,883 --> 00:23:49,130
Well, it's no fun, Bruno.

414
00:23:49,226 --> 00:23:50,319
You know, financially
it's a disaster.

415
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:51,883
The insurance is gonna be
through the roof.

416
00:23:51,979 --> 00:23:53,100
You know your problem, Sandy?

417
00:23:53,197 --> 00:23:54,760
What's my problem?

418
00:23:54,865 --> 00:23:55,757
King's Cross.

419
00:23:55,853 --> 00:23:57,004
Is what?
What is it?

420
00:23:57,099 --> 00:23:58,989
I mean... that's you there.

421
00:23:59,085 --> 00:24:00,781
You got a British
Library over there

422
00:24:00,877 --> 00:24:02,537
with Eurostar,
and bang in the middle

423
00:24:02,632 --> 00:24:04,551
you got crack village
with a load of Somalians

424
00:24:04,656 --> 00:24:05,673
walking about with machetes.

425
00:24:05,769 --> 00:24:07,083
It's an area in flux.

426
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:09,805
Oh, they left
a computer disk, the burglars.

427
00:24:09,901 --> 00:24:11,397
Did you know that?
With my photographs.

428
00:24:11,502 --> 00:24:12,847
Oh. What do you mean? Where?

429
00:24:12,942 --> 00:24:14,601
Sorry, they returned it.

430
00:24:14,698 --> 00:24:16,748
More than that, they downloaded
my personal photographs

431
00:24:16,845 --> 00:24:18,542
off my laptop, that they
stole the first time,

432
00:24:18,637 --> 00:24:19,529
and they brought it back.

433
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:20,517
Well, can we see it?

434
00:24:20,623 --> 00:24:21,678
Yeah.

435
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:23,750
Lovely.

436
00:24:27,183 --> 00:24:29,102
So they got compassion.

437
00:24:29,197 --> 00:24:30,693
I won't go that far.

438
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,869
Well, I'm not saying you gotta
show them compassion.

439
00:24:32,966 --> 00:24:35,594
You know, you're just like
my girlfriend, my ex-girlfriend.

440
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:38,922
They're the criminals,
they're the bad guys.

441
00:24:39,018 --> 00:24:40,610
Can I have a go?

442
00:24:41,892 --> 00:24:43,821
There...
Don't you just love a Mac?

443
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:44,973
Sweet, huh?

444
00:24:45,098 --> 00:24:46,824
And what do you say
to your girlfriend?

445
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,205
I'm the Old Bill,
Will, you know?

446
00:24:48,301 --> 00:24:50,439
I've been on the beat,
undercover, in a suit,

447
00:24:50,534 --> 00:24:51,724
you know, it's the law.

448
00:24:51,819 --> 00:24:54,438
It's, uh, Einstein's
law of relativity.

449
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:57,162
What does that mean,
exactly, sir? Relativity?

450
00:24:57,257 --> 00:24:59,751
Well, relatively speaking, um,
it means, if me and Sandy here

451
00:24:59,846 --> 00:25:02,791
break the law, you know, we're
gonna get a decent lawyer.

452
00:25:02,887 --> 00:25:03,750
Hmm.

453
00:25:03,846 --> 00:25:05,130
Now these guys
who broke in here,

454
00:25:05,226 --> 00:25:09,273
they go straight to jail.
"Do not pass Go."

455
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:12,716
One law for us, one for them.

456
00:25:12,812 --> 00:25:14,853
Except we haven't
broken the law.

457
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:17,309
Everyone's broken the law.

458
00:25:17,895 --> 00:25:19,180
Our vision for King's Cross,

459
00:25:19,276 --> 00:25:20,235
for the public spaces

460
00:25:20,331 --> 00:25:22,373
of King's Cross,
starts with the premise

461
00:25:22,468 --> 00:25:27,081
that we acknowledge an urban
landscape is a built landscape.

462
00:25:27,177 --> 00:25:30,054
It starts as an argument
with society's

463
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,816
phony love affair with nature.

464
00:25:34,312 --> 00:25:37,411
We are against the mistaking
of grass for nature,

465
00:25:37,516 --> 00:25:39,337
of green for nature.

466
00:25:39,434 --> 00:25:42,091
King's Cross is
an area of North London

467
00:25:42,186 --> 00:25:46,922
associated with poverty,
crime, vice and urban decay.

468
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:52,457
Our job is to
transform the landscape,

469
00:25:52,554 --> 00:25:55,142
not decorate it with green...

470
00:25:55,525 --> 00:25:58,690
because how we feel about
ourselves, how we behave,

471
00:25:58,786 --> 00:26:01,866
is directly affected
by the space around us.

472
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:03,495
How we design
the outdoors of our city

473
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:07,791
is as important
as how we design the indoors.

474
00:26:07,906 --> 00:26:10,313
We're gonna take the canal,
and use it like calligraphy,

475
00:26:10,409 --> 00:26:14,225
like ink, to write
around the development.

476
00:26:20,065 --> 00:26:21,159
We think it's the cleaners.

477
00:26:21,254 --> 00:26:22,146
What about the cleaners?

478
00:26:22,242 --> 00:26:23,106
Breaking in.

479
00:26:23,202 --> 00:26:25,024
They don't even clean properly.

480
00:26:25,129 --> 00:26:25,993
It's true.
They don't.

481
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:27,267
They never empty
the dishwasher...

482
00:26:27,364 --> 00:26:28,447
or load it,
for that matter.

483
00:26:28,552 --> 00:26:30,145
They bring their kids,
their boyfriends.

484
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,650
- Come on.
- They do.

485
00:26:31,746 --> 00:26:33,031
And to be honest, Will,

486
00:26:33,127 --> 00:26:34,307
it's getting
a little traumatic.

487
00:26:34,403 --> 00:26:36,291
I'm staying late
at the office and worrying

488
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:38,430
that the place is gonna be
ransacked while I'm in it.

489
00:26:38,536 --> 00:26:40,291
Look, they're cleaners
and they're not clean.

490
00:26:40,388 --> 00:26:41,443
Okay.

491
00:26:41,635 --> 00:26:42,766
Good, thanks.

492
00:26:43,044 --> 00:26:44,866
Thanks for the tea,
thanks for the theory.

493
00:26:44,962 --> 00:26:46,468
I'm sorry, but what
does that mean?

494
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:49,028
It means your boyfriend's
been to the office, Ruby,

495
00:26:49,124 --> 00:26:50,303
and yours, Wei Ping,

496
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,588
and yours, actually, Joe,

497
00:26:51,684 --> 00:26:53,822
so where do the rules say
we can have boyfriends,

498
00:26:53,928 --> 00:26:56,000
but the cleaners can't?

499
00:26:56,096 --> 00:26:56,959
Or kids.

500
00:26:57,055 --> 00:26:59,653
And... explain this
to me, please.

501
00:26:59,749 --> 00:27:02,050
How the cleaners are
getting up onto the roof

502
00:27:02,147 --> 00:27:05,024
then swinging through the
roof line, and why they are,

503
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:09,243
when they've already
got the keys and codes?

504
00:27:10,049 --> 00:27:10,912
All right.

505
00:27:11,008 --> 00:27:12,062
Hi.

506
00:27:12,418 --> 00:27:14,278
I've just been trying
to defend our cleaners.

507
00:27:14,374 --> 00:27:15,428
Uh-huh.

508
00:27:15,621 --> 00:27:18,909
Well, I've just spoken
to the alarm company.

509
00:27:19,006 --> 00:27:22,746
Whoever broke in used
the cleaners' code.

510
00:27:25,315 --> 00:27:27,549
What do we actually do
if we see a burglar?

511
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:30,159
Call the police?
Kill them?

512
00:27:30,341 --> 00:27:31,712
There's a weird ecology,

513
00:27:31,807 --> 00:27:34,396
of course, to these break-ins.

514
00:27:34,493 --> 00:27:36,314
The new computers,
they're upgrades,

515
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,600
you know, they're new models.

516
00:27:37,696 --> 00:27:39,519
You could argue that...

517
00:27:39,615 --> 00:27:41,436
a break-in every,
oh, say, six months,

518
00:27:41,531 --> 00:27:42,721
it's good business, isn't it?

519
00:27:42,816 --> 00:27:44,351
Just not every six days.

520
00:27:44,447 --> 00:27:48,160
I wish they would steal
this car, for instance.

521
00:27:48,255 --> 00:27:49,463
42,000 miles.

522
00:27:53,952 --> 00:27:56,416
I've got the criminal mind.

523
00:27:56,512 --> 00:27:58,947
Lots of wanting to be bad.

524
00:28:00,222 --> 00:28:02,890
See an ass, want to bite it.

525
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,025
I just never do.

526
00:28:06,907 --> 00:28:07,962
Good.

527
00:28:08,988 --> 00:28:10,043
Good.

528
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:12,413
What you've done,
there is you strayed

529
00:28:12,509 --> 00:28:14,521
from the moral to the criminal,

530
00:28:14,627 --> 00:28:15,739
and you crossed
the moral-criminal divide.

531
00:28:15,836 --> 00:28:17,533
Wanting to bite an ass
is a moral issue,

532
00:28:17,628 --> 00:28:19,326
and then only if the ass
belongs to someone

533
00:28:19,422 --> 00:28:20,477
who objects to the idea.

534
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:23,297
Criminal would be biting
the ass without permission.

535
00:28:23,392 --> 00:28:24,256
You're such a lawyer.

536
00:28:24,351 --> 00:28:25,406
Yeah.

537
00:28:25,953 --> 00:28:27,545
Anyway, then what?

538
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:28,571
Then what, what?

539
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:31,255
You bite the ass, then what?

540
00:28:32,223 --> 00:28:34,891
Well, then... they bite yours.

541
00:28:35,198 --> 00:28:36,483
Is the theory.

542
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:41,373
It's so long since
I've bitten or been bit...

543
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:44,769
It's good to talk about that.

544
00:28:44,864 --> 00:28:45,918
Mm.

545
00:28:46,081 --> 00:28:50,974
The problem is, you find out
we're all so miserable.

546
00:28:54,684 --> 00:28:55,816
Hello, hello.

547
00:28:56,382 --> 00:28:58,041
He doesn't look happy.

548
00:28:58,137 --> 00:28:59,287
Do you recognize him?

549
00:28:59,394 --> 00:29:01,676
Uh... no.
I don't know.

550
00:29:02,749 --> 00:29:05,214
God, I wish I could lip-read.

551
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,365
Hang on.

552
00:29:08,187 --> 00:29:09,213
I think I can.

553
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:11,745
"I don't like you anymore.

554
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,825
"I like Sandy.

555
00:29:13,951 --> 00:29:17,049
"He's everything
I want in a man.

556
00:29:17,145 --> 00:29:19,868
"And stop burgling
his bloody office."

557
00:29:19,963 --> 00:29:21,018
God.

558
00:29:25,823 --> 00:29:26,685
Hello.

559
00:29:26,781 --> 00:29:27,914
Got a light?

560
00:29:28,671 --> 00:29:29,879
We don't smoke. Sorry.

561
00:29:29,975 --> 00:29:32,641
But there is the car lighter.

562
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,709
All right.

563
00:29:35,805 --> 00:29:36,859
So is it?

564
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,174
'Course it is.

565
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,163
I don't believe it.

566
00:29:39,258 --> 00:29:40,313
Okay.

567
00:29:44,023 --> 00:29:47,303
I've got nothing on
under my coat.

568
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,911
Well, this,
this might warm you up.

569
00:29:51,005 --> 00:29:52,060
Christ.

570
00:29:52,281 --> 00:29:53,335
Oh, God.

571
00:29:54,074 --> 00:29:55,129
Okay?

572
00:29:55,224 --> 00:29:56,895
Have a good night.

573
00:30:02,812 --> 00:30:03,704
Christ.

574
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:05,621
Can I get inside?
It's cold.

575
00:30:05,717 --> 00:30:07,548
Sorry. Come on, this is a car.

576
00:30:07,643 --> 00:30:09,235
It's not a community
cent... Jesus Christ.

577
00:30:09,341 --> 00:30:10,550
Hey. Come on.

578
00:30:16,477 --> 00:30:17,340
- Um...
- So what are

579
00:30:17,435 --> 00:30:19,545
- you guys looking for?
- Huh?

580
00:30:19,641 --> 00:30:20,983
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

581
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,682
Are you spying on us?

582
00:30:22,778 --> 00:30:23,736
- No.
- Not at all.

583
00:30:23,831 --> 00:30:25,299
- Who's this?
- It's insulting.

584
00:30:25,405 --> 00:30:26,393
- No, we're...
- Seriously, we've been...

585
00:30:26,488 --> 00:30:27,380
Did you not trust us.

586
00:30:27,476 --> 00:30:28,570
This your girlfriend?

587
00:30:28,665 --> 00:30:29,653
No, she's not my girlfriend.

588
00:30:29,748 --> 00:30:32,088
Trust... if you have to say it,
it means there is none.

589
00:30:32,183 --> 00:30:33,336
Use a condom.

590
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:34,746
That's my answer to trust.

591
00:30:34,841 --> 00:30:36,759
Sure, I trust you...
use a condom.

592
00:30:36,855 --> 00:30:38,130
One minute you're nice to me,

593
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:39,866
the next you're spying on me.

594
00:30:39,961 --> 00:30:42,167
No, Erika. Erika, listen.

595
00:30:43,798 --> 00:30:44,853
Erika.

596
00:30:45,208 --> 00:30:46,195
Uh-oh.

597
00:30:46,292 --> 00:30:47,576
Please, please,
can you just listen? Please.

598
00:30:47,673 --> 00:30:50,262
50 pounds, whatever you want.

599
00:30:53,972 --> 00:30:55,162
What's your name?

600
00:30:55,259 --> 00:30:56,312
Except talk.

601
00:30:57,818 --> 00:30:58,998
What if I want to talk?

602
00:30:59,094 --> 00:31:00,369
Call the Samaritans.

603
00:31:00,474 --> 00:31:01,531
Oh, please.

604
00:31:02,297 --> 00:31:03,927
You know, I don't
have time for this.

605
00:31:04,024 --> 00:31:05,078
Humans.

606
00:31:06,066 --> 00:31:06,996
Chat, chat, chat, chat, chat.

607
00:31:07,093 --> 00:31:08,147
We talk.

608
00:31:08,694 --> 00:31:09,682
Why?

609
00:31:09,778 --> 00:31:10,967
I don't know.

610
00:31:11,062 --> 00:31:13,584
Animals don't talk,
because they don't lie.

611
00:31:13,689 --> 00:31:14,744
Erika!

612
00:31:15,924 --> 00:31:17,517
A ridiculous idea.

613
00:31:20,403 --> 00:31:21,400
That was good?

614
00:31:21,496 --> 00:31:23,088
You really helped.

615
00:31:24,153 --> 00:31:25,428
We should, uh...

616
00:31:25,524 --> 00:31:27,384
We need,
we, we need to lock up.

617
00:31:27,481 --> 00:31:28,344
You work here?

618
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,302
Yeah.

619
00:31:29,398 --> 00:31:30,261
Yes.

620
00:31:30,358 --> 00:31:32,563
Bad place for an office.

621
00:31:39,285 --> 00:31:41,645
What's your project about?

622
00:31:41,846 --> 00:31:43,284
I don't really know.

623
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:46,611
A place I'd like to live in...
or run through.

624
00:31:46,707 --> 00:31:49,834
I would love
to jump, you know...

625
00:31:49,969 --> 00:31:51,733
Chik, chik, chik...
jump from...

626
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:55,338
building to building.
Chika-chik, chik.

627
00:31:55,664 --> 00:31:56,566
This is amazing.

628
00:31:56,662 --> 00:31:57,717
But what?

629
00:31:58,225 --> 00:32:00,509
No buts. Is that amazing?

630
00:32:01,458 --> 00:32:02,512
Yeah.

631
00:32:03,346 --> 00:32:04,525
But dangerous.

632
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:05,686
Oh.

633
00:32:06,742 --> 00:32:07,797
No buts.

634
00:32:08,497 --> 00:32:10,087
You see the city?

635
00:32:11,028 --> 00:32:12,544
What is it like?

636
00:32:14,548 --> 00:32:15,603
Better.

637
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:22,738
Did my dad just
not want to come with us?

638
00:32:22,834 --> 00:32:24,196
Uh... He, um...

639
00:32:27,829 --> 00:32:29,037
He loved you,

640
00:32:30,227 --> 00:32:32,509
but, uh, he was engineer.

641
00:32:33,172 --> 00:32:34,456
He was needed.

642
00:32:35,981 --> 00:32:38,877
Every bridge was blown up. So...

643
00:32:39,184 --> 00:32:40,239
Anyway,

644
00:32:40,911 --> 00:32:42,885
it's more complicated.

645
00:32:43,988 --> 00:32:47,038
No story from Sarajevo
is simple.

646
00:32:49,043 --> 00:32:50,097
No! No!

647
00:32:52,878 --> 00:32:54,469
I don't want to.

648
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:56,820
No! No!

649
00:33:36,714 --> 00:33:38,306
There's no bread.

650
00:33:38,575 --> 00:33:42,314
No bread, no butter,
no flour, no dairy.

651
00:33:42,928 --> 00:33:44,203
Nor last night.
You didn't notice.

652
00:33:44,299 --> 00:33:45,355
I did.

653
00:33:45,614 --> 00:33:46,668
Hmm.

654
00:33:47,474 --> 00:33:49,373
We're trying a diet.

655
00:33:50,254 --> 00:33:51,598
How's the chicken?

656
00:33:51,693 --> 00:33:52,749
Chicken's good.

657
00:33:52,844 --> 00:33:53,899
Good.

658
00:33:54,129 --> 00:33:55,720
Ice cream is dairy.

659
00:33:55,817 --> 00:33:57,561
Ice cream is dairy,

660
00:33:58,089 --> 00:33:58,952
That's right.

661
00:33:59,048 --> 00:34:00,008
Sweetie, try the chicken.

662
00:34:00,113 --> 00:34:01,197
Try the chicken first.

663
00:34:01,293 --> 00:34:03,958
This is a diet just for you.

664
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:07,113
Bea, put those
things back, now.

665
00:34:07,564 --> 00:34:08,743
Have some chicken.

666
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:10,480
Rosemary suggested
we try this.

667
00:34:10,575 --> 00:34:11,497
- Where is it?
- Remember her?

668
00:34:11,592 --> 00:34:12,743
- Where is it?
- Therapist Rosemary.

669
00:34:12,848 --> 00:34:14,507
What have you done
with the ice cream?

670
00:34:14,603 --> 00:34:15,466
There's amazing stuff

671
00:34:15,562 --> 00:34:18,191
about the affect
of food on mood,

672
00:34:18,287 --> 00:34:19,438
on the brain.

673
00:34:19,534 --> 00:34:20,396
Rosemary.

674
00:34:20,491 --> 00:34:21,355
I chose it!

675
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:22,736
She said that?

676
00:34:23,369 --> 00:34:24,328
Wow.

677
00:34:24,425 --> 00:34:25,287
It's not fair!

678
00:34:25,393 --> 00:34:26,793
Every time I say
something in this house,

679
00:34:26,888 --> 00:34:28,106
it gets repeated
back as a question.

680
00:34:28,203 --> 00:34:29,227
You know I like ice cream!

681
00:34:29,322 --> 00:34:30,734
If I say "good morning,"
people ask me

682
00:34:30,829 --> 00:34:32,297
what makes me think
it's a good morning.

683
00:34:32,392 --> 00:34:33,545
- What?
- No ice cream!

684
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,760
I'm trying to hold
this family together, Will.

685
00:34:35,855 --> 00:34:36,938
There's no ice cream, Mama.

686
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:38,406
Who are "people"?
Who are these mysterious people?

687
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:40,237
I feel a fool
with my sun box, I do,

688
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:42,413
but it's the only sun
you can rely on in this house.

689
00:34:42,509 --> 00:34:44,429
- I want the ice cream!
- No, Liv... Hey, Liv, come on.

690
00:34:44,525 --> 00:34:46,030
- What are you talking about?
- Why have you taken it away?!

691
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:46,989
I wanted a slice of bread.

692
00:34:47,084 --> 00:34:47,947
You know what? Really?

693
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,223
Can we, can we just try this?

694
00:34:49,319 --> 00:34:50,700
Can we try this
as a family, please?

695
00:34:50,796 --> 00:34:52,072
Just as a family for a week?

696
00:34:52,167 --> 00:34:54,181
Don't say try together
if we don't decide together.

697
00:34:54,287 --> 00:34:55,369
Well, don't take
a side together,

698
00:34:55,465 --> 00:34:56,358
if we don't cook together

699
00:34:56,454 --> 00:34:57,797
or talk together
or do anything together.

700
00:34:57,902 --> 00:34:59,369
- It's not fair!
- We don't do anything together.

701
00:34:59,465 --> 00:35:00,453
- There we are.
- Exercise...

702
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:01,478
- Exercise...
- "There we are" what?

703
00:35:01,574 --> 00:35:02,437
- Stop that.
- Exercise. Exercise...

704
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:03,751
You don't even hear it, Will.

705
00:35:03,847 --> 00:35:05,450
- You don't even hear it.
- Exercise, exercise...

706
00:35:05,546 --> 00:35:06,409
Eat your chicken first!

707
00:35:06,504 --> 00:35:07,751
- No!
- Stop yelling.

708
00:35:07,847 --> 00:35:09,227
Chicken?
I'm a vegetarian.

709
00:35:09,323 --> 00:35:11,308
- Don't you yell at me.
- You don't eat vegetables.

710
00:35:11,404 --> 00:35:12,871
- It's disgusting!
- You don't eat vegetables.

711
00:35:12,967 --> 00:35:16,632
- Disgusting! Disgusting!
- Will you stop?

712
00:35:17,034 --> 00:35:20,774
No, it's disgusting!
No, leave me alone!

713
00:35:20,907 --> 00:35:23,430
Now, what we know is,
if we smash things

714
00:35:23,527 --> 00:35:25,388
and we scream and we shout,
we get our own way.

715
00:35:25,482 --> 00:35:27,852
That's what we know.
Or run away.

716
00:35:27,948 --> 00:35:29,233
Great... Great.

717
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,609
That's great.

718
00:35:35,561 --> 00:35:36,616
Liv.

719
00:35:40,933 --> 00:35:42,063
Liv, darling.

720
00:35:46,762 --> 00:35:47,817
Liv!

721
00:35:48,844 --> 00:35:50,282
Or we just say nothing!

722
00:35:50,378 --> 00:35:51,817
Because God forbid we ever...

723
00:35:51,912 --> 00:35:53,639
we ever say
what we actually meant!

724
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:57,014
No, just let
the shutter come down!

725
00:35:59,239 --> 00:36:00,294
Anyway...

726
00:36:01,579 --> 00:36:05,396
I really have
to get back to the office.

727
00:36:39,909 --> 00:36:43,076
Bea, my car keys.
Where's the battery? Bea.

728
00:36:43,171 --> 00:36:44,965
Hey, I need the battery.

729
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,624
We're human.
Don't punish us.

730
00:36:46,729 --> 00:36:47,907
We get fed up.

731
00:36:48,004 --> 00:36:50,976
Fed up.
Is that about the diet?

732
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,741
No. It means upset.
I don't know why.

733
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:54,210
It's a metaphor, remember?
We spoke about those.

734
00:36:54,305 --> 00:36:56,098
"Cried your eyes out" doesn't
mean your eyeballs fall out.

735
00:36:56,194 --> 00:36:57,345
Metaphors. "Fed up."

736
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,563
It's nothing to do with food.

737
00:36:58,658 --> 00:36:59,617
Where's my battery, Bea?

738
00:36:59,713 --> 00:37:01,286
- It's in my box.
- Where's your box?

739
00:37:01,382 --> 00:37:02,820
It's my box.
You can't go in my box.

740
00:37:02,917 --> 00:37:04,162
- Well, you go get the battery.
- Bea.

741
00:37:04,258 --> 00:37:05,888
It's all right.
We're working it out.

742
00:37:05,984 --> 00:37:08,958
Bea, go and get
Will's battery.

743
00:37:13,666 --> 00:37:15,181
"Will's battery"?

744
00:37:15,652 --> 00:37:16,928
Can you explain to me

745
00:37:17,023 --> 00:37:18,720
why you suddenly need
to go to the office?

746
00:37:18,817 --> 00:37:20,101
- You know why.
- You're not the police.

747
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,664
No, and the police
are not night watchmen.

748
00:37:21,759 --> 00:37:23,073
Nor are you.
Most wives would worry

749
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:24,895
if their husbands went
cruising in King's Cross

750
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,526
- every night.
- Come on.

751
00:37:26,623 --> 00:37:28,099
Hire a security company, Will.

752
00:37:28,195 --> 00:37:29,604
Most wives are married

753
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,551
to their husbands, as we're
being so accurate tonight.

754
00:37:31,647 --> 00:37:34,401
Dads, wives, Will's battery.
Thanks for that.

755
00:37:34,496 --> 00:37:37,027
I don't see the real father
around much.

756
00:37:37,123 --> 00:37:39,205
I love your sun box,
whatever the fuck

757
00:37:39,301 --> 00:37:40,480
it's supposed to do.

758
00:37:40,577 --> 00:37:43,703
I keep hoping
it'll warm you up.

759
00:38:05,346 --> 00:38:07,006
Skinny cup, extra shot, right?

760
00:38:07,101 --> 00:38:08,156
Right.

761
00:38:11,072 --> 00:38:12,126
Thanks.

762
00:38:16,289 --> 00:38:18,109
Oh. I brought a CD.

763
00:38:18,589 --> 00:38:19,932
I've got some CDs.

764
00:38:20,028 --> 00:38:21,343
No. For dancing.

765
00:38:21,438 --> 00:38:22,820
I like to dance.

766
00:38:22,916 --> 00:38:23,970
In cars?

767
00:38:24,766 --> 00:38:26,971
Inside, outside, upside down.

768
00:38:27,067 --> 00:38:29,186
I can dance on your lap,
but it's not

769
00:38:29,282 --> 00:38:30,970
- for free.
- Absolutely.

770
00:38:31,066 --> 00:38:33,665
I still make you come,
but not inside me.

771
00:38:33,761 --> 00:38:36,801
Some guys think
that's not cheating.

772
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:37,952
Hmm?

773
00:39:10,778 --> 00:39:11,833
That's good.

774
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:13,148
You are. You're very good.

775
00:39:13,243 --> 00:39:14,451
You're great.

776
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,705
That's okay. It's fine.

777
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:25,210
What do you mean?

778
00:39:25,307 --> 00:39:26,362
It's okay.

779
00:39:46,396 --> 00:39:47,450
Hi.

780
00:39:52,956 --> 00:39:54,010
I'm sorry.

781
00:39:55,638 --> 00:39:57,538
You smell of perfume.

782
00:39:59,102 --> 00:40:01,309
I don't know how I do.

783
00:40:01,692 --> 00:40:02,747
Nor do I.

784
00:40:04,472 --> 00:40:05,527
I love you.

785
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,768
Is that an answer?

786
00:40:09,402 --> 00:40:10,841
It's the truth.

787
00:40:12,279 --> 00:40:13,525
What do you need?

788
00:40:13,621 --> 00:40:15,002
What do you want ever?

789
00:40:15,098 --> 00:40:17,658
I feel as if I'm
tapping on a window.

790
00:40:17,754 --> 00:40:19,796
You're somewhere
behind the glass,

791
00:40:19,892 --> 00:40:21,082
but you can't hear me.

792
00:40:21,178 --> 00:40:22,741
Even when you're
angry, like now,

793
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,436
it's like someone a long, long
way away is angry with me.

794
00:40:25,531 --> 00:40:29,655
Well, glass is better than ice,
which is where we were earlier.

795
00:40:29,751 --> 00:40:33,846
Sweden, ice, depression,
the high rate of suicide?

796
00:40:33,943 --> 00:40:34,996
Mm-hmm.

797
00:40:35,352 --> 00:40:38,363
I never got close to anybody who
didn't want to talk about that.

798
00:40:38,458 --> 00:40:40,433
- Mm.
- Or free love.

799
00:40:41,019 --> 00:40:42,516
- Liv Ullmann.
- Liv Ullmann.

800
00:40:42,611 --> 00:40:45,200
Who's Norwegian, by the way.

801
00:40:46,236 --> 00:40:48,596
Well, there are no other
Swedes to talk about?

802
00:40:48,692 --> 00:40:49,948
Nobody lives there.

803
00:40:50,044 --> 00:40:52,182
You could drive for hours
before you pass another Volvo.

804
00:40:52,278 --> 00:40:53,334
Abba.

805
00:40:54,359 --> 00:40:56,949
Let's face it.
It's a sad old list.

806
00:40:57,045 --> 00:40:58,387
What about the English?

807
00:40:58,483 --> 00:41:00,026
You brought us what? Sarcasm?

808
00:41:00,123 --> 00:41:02,328
- Mm.
- And the Beatles.

809
00:41:05,043 --> 00:41:06,098
Lager louts.

810
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,287
No. You invented lager.

811
00:41:07,383 --> 00:41:08,792
Excuse me. The Danes.

812
00:41:08,888 --> 00:41:10,585
Yeah, same difference.

813
00:41:10,681 --> 00:41:11,736
No, no, no.

814
00:41:19,225 --> 00:41:20,895
I love your laugh.

815
00:41:21,786 --> 00:41:23,455
I love your laugh.

816
00:41:23,705 --> 00:41:27,156
I'd like to gather up all your
laughs and lock them in a box,

817
00:41:27,253 --> 00:41:31,760
like Bea's, and nobody
would be allowed the key.

818
00:41:35,509 --> 00:41:36,728
Where are you going?

819
00:41:36,824 --> 00:41:37,878
The shower.

820
00:41:38,425 --> 00:41:39,767
Or to kill that fucking fox.

821
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:41,224
Come back here.

822
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:19,920
- Mama?
- I'll take you.

823
00:42:20,016 --> 00:42:21,877
- I'm taking you.
- Mom takes me.

824
00:42:21,972 --> 00:42:23,602
No, no. It's okay. It's okay.

825
00:42:23,699 --> 00:42:25,972
I'm taking Bea. I want to.
Go back to sleep.

826
00:42:26,067 --> 00:42:26,930
Mom takes me.

827
00:42:27,026 --> 00:42:28,974
Daddy will take you today.

828
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:30,641
It's fine. It's fine.

829
00:42:30,736 --> 00:42:31,946
See? I'm up.

830
00:42:34,353 --> 00:42:35,408
It's okay.

831
00:42:36,118 --> 00:42:37,480
Seat belt, Bea.

832
00:42:46,541 --> 00:42:47,673
What's that?

833
00:42:48,497 --> 00:42:49,524
Is that a CD?

834
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:50,578
Yeah.

835
00:42:50,674 --> 00:42:52,142
Yes, it's a CD.

836
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:53,101
Is it yours?

837
00:42:53,198 --> 00:42:54,252
N... Yes.

838
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:57,963
Shut up!

839
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,850
"Shut up" is good, isn't it?

840
00:43:00,946 --> 00:43:02,001
Excellent.

841
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:17,105
I did it!

842
00:43:17,614 --> 00:43:19,214
I did it! I did it!

843
00:43:19,311 --> 00:43:22,820
You watch, I'm going
to do it again.

844
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,402
Paul?
Paul, are you ready?

845
00:43:24,497 --> 00:43:25,784
Are you ready?

846
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:38,318
Sweetie, you're still wet.

847
00:43:38,414 --> 00:43:39,277
You're dripping.

848
00:43:39,373 --> 00:43:40,236
Yellow towel.

849
00:43:40,332 --> 00:43:41,904
It's not yellow.
Is it yellow?

850
00:43:42,001 --> 00:43:43,342
Yellow stitching.

851
00:43:43,438 --> 00:43:44,493
Oh.

852
00:43:45,068 --> 00:43:46,699
You have to dry yourself.

853
00:43:46,794 --> 00:43:49,538
I did. I used the hair dryer.

854
00:43:49,739 --> 00:43:51,819
Well, how about my sweater?

855
00:43:51,915 --> 00:43:53,776
It's kind of a towel.

856
00:43:53,872 --> 00:43:55,694
Is it a good color?

857
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:58,956
It's a good color,
and it's a sort of towel.

858
00:43:59,051 --> 00:44:00,336
But you'll be cold.

859
00:44:00,432 --> 00:44:04,249
No. If I get cold,
I'll wear the towel.

860
00:44:13,033 --> 00:44:16,772
Hey, look.
Those guys... they're amazing.

861
00:44:27,533 --> 00:44:29,048
I want a lesson.

862
00:44:41,102 --> 00:44:42,158
Oh!

863
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:44,172
Mom, are you okay?

864
00:44:44,268 --> 00:44:45,860
You okay? Get up.

865
00:44:49,743 --> 00:44:51,085
Oh, you're soaked.

866
00:44:51,181 --> 00:44:53,772
Excuse me. We would like
to donate our towel.

867
00:44:53,868 --> 00:44:55,373
No, I'm fine, thanks.

868
00:44:55,469 --> 00:44:56,810
Really, we hate our towel.

869
00:44:56,907 --> 00:44:58,566
We hate our towel.
We do. We hate it.

870
00:44:58,671 --> 00:45:00,493
It's looking for a new home.

871
00:45:00,589 --> 00:45:01,644
Thank you.

872
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:04,062
Come on, lovey.

873
00:45:05,998 --> 00:45:06,986
That was good.

874
00:45:07,081 --> 00:45:08,453
You should join the circus.

875
00:45:08,558 --> 00:45:09,614
Get off me!

876
00:45:18,025 --> 00:45:19,080
It's cold.

877
00:45:19,627 --> 00:45:21,217
It's a bit cold.

878
00:45:21,389 --> 00:45:22,733
Why wind down the window?

879
00:45:22,828 --> 00:45:24,344
To get some air.

880
00:45:24,487 --> 00:45:25,544
Why?

881
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:27,049
You know.

882
00:45:27,145 --> 00:45:29,197
Quite a strong perfume.

883
00:45:29,676 --> 00:45:31,719
- Actually...
- It's my job.

884
00:45:31,814 --> 00:45:33,444
I got you a present.

885
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:36,140
In return for the CD,
the coffees...

886
00:45:36,236 --> 00:45:37,577
It's good, I think.

887
00:45:37,674 --> 00:45:41,184
My wife uses it.
She says it's good.

888
00:45:41,931 --> 00:45:43,275
That's fucked up.

889
00:45:43,370 --> 00:45:44,655
What man wants

890
00:45:45,509 --> 00:45:47,235
to be with a girl
that smells like his wife?

891
00:45:47,341 --> 00:45:49,604
No, I didn't say I wanted
to be with a girl.

892
00:45:49,699 --> 00:45:50,956
You think I like
to smell like this?

893
00:45:51,052 --> 00:45:52,778
You think I like to wear panties
which cut my pussy in half?

894
00:45:52,874 --> 00:45:53,641
I didn't mention your...

895
00:45:53,736 --> 00:45:55,405
Men are incredible!

896
00:46:02,281 --> 00:46:03,335
Thank you.

897
00:46:11,238 --> 00:46:12,293
Ow!

898
00:46:14,538 --> 00:46:17,482
So what, you clean this area up?

899
00:46:17,578 --> 00:46:18,852
- Is that the plan?
- Not exactly.

900
00:46:18,949 --> 00:46:22,305
If you work with nature,
why are you so against nature?

901
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:26,687
Well, A: I'm not,
and B: I'm absolutely not.

902
00:46:28,002 --> 00:46:29,958
The fox in your garden.

903
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:31,848
What about the fox in my garden?

904
00:46:31,943 --> 00:46:34,820
The one wild thing in your life
and it makes you crazy.

905
00:46:34,916 --> 00:46:37,093
You know, turn the whole world
into a park,

906
00:46:37,188 --> 00:46:38,723
- like Disneyland.
- That's not what we do.

907
00:46:38,819 --> 00:46:40,352
- With flowers...
- Oh, that's ironic,

908
00:46:40,449 --> 00:46:41,928
because that's the
opposite of what we do.

909
00:46:42,023 --> 00:46:42,886
Go ahead, clean up,

910
00:46:42,981 --> 00:46:44,257
because we will move
to another alley,

911
00:46:44,362 --> 00:46:45,637
and we'll take
the foxes with us.

912
00:46:45,734 --> 00:46:46,376
Good.

913
00:46:46,472 --> 00:46:48,936
Because this is the human heart.

914
00:46:49,032 --> 00:46:51,592
This is the world.
It's light and dark.

915
00:46:51,688 --> 00:46:54,729
They're putting fortune cookies
in with the crack now, are they?

916
00:46:54,825 --> 00:46:56,704
This is what, the human heart?
This is the world?

917
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:57,663
This is shit.

918
00:46:57,768 --> 00:46:58,920
You're talking shit.

919
00:46:59,014 --> 00:47:00,645
I have to charge you.

920
00:47:00,741 --> 00:47:02,687
- Huh?
- No, I have to charge you.

921
00:47:02,784 --> 00:47:03,973
You crossed the line.

922
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:05,921
- What do you mean?
- We have chit chat, it's free.

923
00:47:06,016 --> 00:47:08,451
I keep warm, I buy coffee.

924
00:47:09,247 --> 00:47:10,533
It's a trade.

925
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,710
You abuse me, that's business.

926
00:47:12,805 --> 00:47:13,726
How did I abuse you?

927
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,162
Men abuse me, I get paid.
50 pound.

928
00:47:16,258 --> 00:47:17,763
No way am I giving you
50 pounds.

929
00:47:17,859 --> 00:47:18,627
50 pound.

930
00:47:18,722 --> 00:47:19,874
I'm not giving you 50 pounds.

931
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:20,900
50 pounds!

932
00:47:20,996 --> 00:47:21,926
No.

933
00:47:22,023 --> 00:47:23,230
- Fuck!
- Oh.

934
00:47:23,365 --> 00:47:24,418
Uh-oh.

935
00:47:26,213 --> 00:47:28,102
- He's like a monkey.
- I've got to call the police.

936
00:47:28,198 --> 00:47:29,215
What? To say what?

937
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,184
To say what?!

938
00:47:30,279 --> 00:47:32,540
There's a man
breaking into my building!

939
00:47:32,646 --> 00:47:34,402
It's not a man, it's a boy.

940
00:47:34,498 --> 00:47:37,031
I've got a special thing,
a code,

941
00:47:37,126 --> 00:47:38,430
four-three, uh...

942
00:47:38,527 --> 00:47:40,223
No, I'm Hoff...
Yes, I'm Hoff...

943
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:41,441
Well, my partner's Hoffman.

944
00:47:41,537 --> 00:47:43,138
Where am I?!
I'm in my car!

945
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:44,606
I'm looking at him!

946
00:47:44,701 --> 00:47:45,833
I'm... four!

947
00:47:46,688 --> 00:47:47,742
Hey!

948
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,535
Wait!

949
00:47:50,629 --> 00:47:51,683
Come here!

950
00:48:00,094 --> 00:48:01,148
Fuck.

951
00:48:08,609 --> 00:48:09,665
Hey!

952
00:48:21,948 --> 00:48:23,263
We're getting out of here.

953
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:24,643
What about Miro?

954
00:48:24,739 --> 00:48:26,179
What about Miro?

955
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:29,884
What happened to your hand?

956
00:49:29,979 --> 00:49:30,872
Forgot my keys.

957
00:49:30,977 --> 00:49:32,416
You're bleeding.

958
00:49:36,953 --> 00:49:38,007
No.

959
00:49:41,594 --> 00:49:43,415
I didn't fall, Mom.

960
00:49:44,096 --> 00:49:45,179
Why can't you do it?

961
00:49:45,275 --> 00:49:46,791
You're a tailor.

962
00:50:25,658 --> 00:50:26,713
Dad!

963
00:50:27,164 --> 00:50:28,219
Dad! Dad!

964
00:50:28,794 --> 00:50:30,262
I'm too old to chase robbers.

965
00:50:30,358 --> 00:50:31,931
Dad!
All right, hey.

966
00:50:32,026 --> 00:50:34,491
Oh. Hey, what are you
crying about?

967
00:50:34,586 --> 00:50:36,246
Where the hell
have you been?

968
00:50:36,343 --> 00:50:38,394
We've been worried sick.

969
00:50:38,491 --> 00:50:39,545
Why is Mommy crying?

970
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,396
Why aren't you in bed?

971
00:50:41,502 --> 00:50:43,612
I near... I could've caught him.
I nearly caught him.

972
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,722
The police weren't
going to get here,

973
00:50:45,817 --> 00:50:46,997
so I followed him.

974
00:50:47,093 --> 00:50:48,981
I mean, I imagine,
it's just a boy.

975
00:50:49,077 --> 00:50:50,554
What did the police
do with my car?

976
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:51,639
The police?

977
00:50:51,734 --> 00:50:54,008
They were here for probably
about a minute.

978
00:50:54,103 --> 00:50:55,732
So what are you telling me?

979
00:50:55,828 --> 00:50:57,459
Somebody's stolen my car?

980
00:50:57,564 --> 00:50:58,773
- Eh?
- Oh...

981
00:50:59,482 --> 00:51:00,662
My bag's in there,
the wallet, my keys.

982
00:51:00,758 --> 00:51:01,621
Oh, Jesus Christ, Will.

983
00:51:01,716 --> 00:51:03,156
You left the car open?

984
00:51:03,252 --> 00:51:05,044
Yeah, well, I was
chasing a thief, Liv.

985
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:08,113
Did you get a look at this boy?

986
00:51:09,427 --> 00:51:10,424
No, not really.

987
00:51:10,521 --> 00:51:11,575
Hey, hey...

988
00:51:12,274 --> 00:51:13,331
it's okay.

989
00:51:25,365 --> 00:51:27,638
Reminds me of when
I first met you,

990
00:51:27,735 --> 00:51:29,018
driving around,

991
00:51:29,144 --> 00:51:31,253
trying to get her
to sleep in the back.

992
00:51:31,349 --> 00:51:33,325
You in your nightgown.

993
00:51:35,704 --> 00:51:36,758
Remember?

994
00:51:40,019 --> 00:51:41,151
So beautiful.

995
00:51:51,192 --> 00:51:52,659
Will, a boy can still stab you.

996
00:51:52,755 --> 00:51:54,231
Now, what if you'd
caught up with him?

997
00:51:54,327 --> 00:51:55,612
I don't know.

998
00:51:59,161 --> 00:52:00,915
Anyway, he's not going
to come back.

999
00:52:01,011 --> 00:52:03,523
It's probably all over now.

1000
00:52:06,324 --> 00:52:07,379
Zoran...

1001
00:52:07,475 --> 00:52:08,608
Zoran, watch.

1002
00:52:12,309 --> 00:52:14,360
Hey, did you see that?

1003
00:52:14,486 --> 00:52:16,049
Did you see that?
I just landed it.

1004
00:52:16,144 --> 00:52:17,659
Yeah, yeah, nice.

1005
00:52:25,111 --> 00:52:28,006
You're in the wrong place, man.

1006
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:43,024
I telephoned earlier
about my jacket.

1007
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,175
Yes.

1008
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:47,475
This is strange.
You probably don't remember,

1009
00:52:47,571 --> 00:52:49,842
we bumped into each
other the other day

1010
00:52:49,939 --> 00:52:50,927
at the sport center.

1011
00:52:51,022 --> 00:52:52,625
We gave you our towel.

1012
00:52:52,721 --> 00:52:54,313
Oh, that's right.

1013
00:52:54,927 --> 00:52:57,899
So, I've, uh, I tore my jacket.

1014
00:52:58,224 --> 00:53:00,507
Oh, I can't repair that.

1015
00:53:01,524 --> 00:53:05,486
Well, I can, but...
you'd always see the tear.

1016
00:53:05,591 --> 00:53:07,824
I don't think, the cost,
I don't think is worth doing.

1017
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:08,975
Really?

1018
00:53:10,289 --> 00:53:14,490
It's a favorite.
I'd hate to throw it away.

1019
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:17,548
I can try.

1020
00:53:18,162 --> 00:53:19,677
Come back Friday.

1021
00:53:20,272 --> 00:53:21,298
Great. Friday.

1022
00:53:21,394 --> 00:53:23,090
Good, I'll see you on Friday.

1023
00:53:23,187 --> 00:53:24,242
Friday.

1024
00:53:31,501 --> 00:53:33,784
- Excuse me!
- Excuse me!

1025
00:53:34,772 --> 00:53:35,827
Your wallet.

1026
00:53:36,019 --> 00:53:37,870
It was in your jacket.

1027
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:39,921
Oh, thank you.
It's new.

1028
00:53:40,017 --> 00:53:41,484
I've already lost
one wallet this week.

1029
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:42,577
Thank you.

1030
00:53:42,673 --> 00:53:44,802
I was rude, I'm sorry.

1031
00:53:45,483 --> 00:53:46,347
This city, you know,

1032
00:53:46,443 --> 00:53:48,044
you see someone in one place,

1033
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:49,329
and then another,
it makes you very...

1034
00:53:49,425 --> 00:53:50,288
Sure.

1035
00:53:50,384 --> 00:53:53,587
- I have to get back.
- All right.

1036
00:53:54,029 --> 00:53:55,084
Can you...

1037
00:53:55,601 --> 00:53:58,728
if I, if I brought a suit, can...

1038
00:53:59,889 --> 00:54:02,766
I lost some weight... if I
brought it tomorrow, say?

1039
00:54:02,861 --> 00:54:03,887
I'm out tomorrow.

1040
00:54:03,983 --> 00:54:05,037
Friday then?

1041
00:54:06,131 --> 00:54:07,185
Okay.

1042
00:54:08,875 --> 00:54:09,929
Okay.

1043
00:54:11,856 --> 00:54:13,602
Thank you for this.

1044
00:54:21,743 --> 00:54:23,489
Will, she's asleep.

1045
00:54:24,553 --> 00:54:26,414
- Huh?
- It's a miracle.

1046
00:54:26,509 --> 00:54:27,632
I can't believe it.

1047
00:54:27,727 --> 00:54:29,397
That's great, huh?

1048
00:54:32,014 --> 00:54:34,603
Why are you trying on suits?

1049
00:54:35,054 --> 00:54:36,521
Nothing really fits me.

1050
00:54:36,617 --> 00:54:37,902
It looks fine.

1051
00:54:42,093 --> 00:54:44,365
Can I say "Rosemary says"?

1052
00:54:44,461 --> 00:54:46,667
Absolutely.
What does Rosemary say?

1053
00:54:46,762 --> 00:54:47,818
She says...

1054
00:54:49,515 --> 00:54:51,818
Well, you know, it's:
Bea says "I need."

1055
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:53,351
I say "I'm here,"
she says, "I need,"

1056
00:54:53,447 --> 00:54:54,857
I say "I'm here."

1057
00:54:54,953 --> 00:54:57,610
I'm not talking about going
to work tomorrow, I'm just...

1058
00:54:57,706 --> 00:55:00,649
thinking about
going back to work.

1059
00:55:00,745 --> 00:55:01,801
Good.

1060
00:55:03,239 --> 00:55:05,829
And start thinking about you.

1061
00:55:06,826 --> 00:55:07,881
About us.

1062
00:55:08,303 --> 00:55:11,198
Bea can come
with me sometimes.

1063
00:55:11,688 --> 00:55:13,386
She can dig, make a mess.

1064
00:55:13,481 --> 00:55:15,726
No, that's great,
but you're busy and distracted.

1065
00:55:15,822 --> 00:55:16,875
And?

1066
00:55:17,192 --> 00:55:18,190
Go on.

1067
00:55:18,285 --> 00:55:19,340
And...

1068
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:21,545
she's not my daughter.

1069
00:55:21,642 --> 00:55:24,682
And right now
when she's such a, she's so...

1070
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:28,594
you can't trust me
to take care of her.

1071
00:55:29,391 --> 00:55:32,287
If you were measuring how far...

1072
00:55:32,489 --> 00:55:36,391
away from where we need to be,
you and me...

1073
00:55:36,487 --> 00:55:38,309
is that a long way?

1074
00:55:40,649 --> 00:55:44,551
I don't think you can ask
a question like that. It's...

1075
00:55:44,648 --> 00:55:47,851
Put on a suit,
sound like a suit.

1076
00:55:51,657 --> 00:55:55,014
It feels a long,
long way right now...

1077
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:57,546
from where it needs to be.

1078
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:00,749
I wish we could
unsay and unhurt

1079
00:56:01,286 --> 00:56:03,570
back to wherever that is,

1080
00:56:04,231 --> 00:56:05,668
and start again.

1081
00:56:06,791 --> 00:56:08,384
And how far back?

1082
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:12,939
I remember you bit me.

1083
00:56:13,035 --> 00:56:14,731
You were angry with me
and you bit me.

1084
00:56:14,826 --> 00:56:16,803
I don't remember why.

1085
00:56:18,923 --> 00:56:22,441
I don't know why either,
but I remember I bit you.

1086
00:56:22,538 --> 00:56:24,206
You really bit me.

1087
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:30,747
And I thought
we were very close.

1088
00:56:31,753 --> 00:56:32,809
We were.

1089
00:56:48,612 --> 00:56:51,202
Yeah, but that's just teeth.

1090
00:57:06,469 --> 00:57:08,454
It's not invisible, but...

1091
00:57:08,551 --> 00:57:09,912
That's amazing.

1092
00:57:11,810 --> 00:57:13,403
Astonishing, great.

1093
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:16,933
- Shall I put it on?
- Yes.

1094
00:57:17,028 --> 00:57:18,151
Is there, somewhere?

1095
00:57:18,246 --> 00:57:19,300
Uh, yeah, my son's room.

1096
00:57:19,397 --> 00:57:20,259
Just there.

1097
00:57:20,355 --> 00:57:21,410
Is he in?

1098
00:57:21,544 --> 00:57:23,751
No, no, he's at school.

1099
00:57:46,469 --> 00:57:48,578
Your son, is he studying
to be an architect?

1100
00:57:48,675 --> 00:57:50,343
No, he's only 15.

1101
00:57:50,535 --> 00:57:52,586
It's a school project.

1102
00:57:57,190 --> 00:57:58,753
I'm an architect...

1103
00:57:58,850 --> 00:57:59,904
of sorts.

1104
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:01,629
Hmm.

1105
00:58:06,982 --> 00:58:08,036
Funny.

1106
00:58:08,736 --> 00:58:10,481
Your son's project.

1107
00:58:13,158 --> 00:58:14,021
We use those figures.

1108
00:58:14,117 --> 00:58:15,009
They're scale figures.

1109
00:58:15,105 --> 00:58:15,997
They're from Japan.

1110
00:58:16,102 --> 00:58:17,598
Hard to find in London.

1111
00:58:17,694 --> 00:58:18,749
Oh.

1112
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:21,617
He must get them from school.

1113
00:58:23,429 --> 00:58:25,020
Uh, your trousers?

1114
00:58:33,315 --> 00:58:34,908
You have, uh, children?

1115
00:58:35,013 --> 00:58:36,931
Oh, you were with a little girl.

1116
00:58:37,026 --> 00:58:38,589
- My daughter.
- Uh-huh.

1117
00:58:38,686 --> 00:58:40,048
I remember her.

1118
00:58:41,668 --> 00:58:44,641
This will take
a week, at least.

1119
00:58:44,737 --> 00:58:45,859
I'll have to remove the lining.

1120
00:58:45,955 --> 00:58:47,087
That's fine.

1121
00:58:47,259 --> 00:58:50,846
I'll write you a bill
for the jacket.

1122
00:58:55,229 --> 00:58:57,721
Should I just write "repairs"?

1123
00:58:57,826 --> 00:58:58,882
Yeah.

1124
00:59:04,444 --> 00:59:05,575
What's this?

1125
00:59:06,812 --> 00:59:08,558
A practice keyboard.

1126
00:59:08,730 --> 00:59:10,073
No space for piano up here.

1127
00:59:10,178 --> 00:59:12,730
You can play electric
or electronic keyboard?

1128
00:59:12,827 --> 00:59:15,491
Um, no, I'm happy with this.

1129
00:59:15,836 --> 00:59:17,660
You know, I imagine.

1130
00:59:18,427 --> 00:59:19,635
You know, so.

1131
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:25,313
Not a good place to make noises.

1132
00:59:25,408 --> 00:59:28,228
You could always use headphones.

1133
00:59:32,897 --> 00:59:38,095
I'm fixing this and I, um,
should mind my own business.

1134
00:59:41,950 --> 00:59:45,883
People like me from my country,
we... I'm Bosnian...

1135
00:59:45,978 --> 00:59:50,486
we think it's dangerous
not to be able to hear.

1136
01:00:09,339 --> 01:00:12,464
Tell your son
if he's interested,

1137
01:00:12,925 --> 01:00:17,530
he can come and see our office,
you know, to look around.

1138
01:00:17,625 --> 01:00:18,621
We're very close.

1139
01:00:18,718 --> 01:00:19,830
King's Cross.

1140
01:00:19,926 --> 01:00:21,441
I might do that.

1141
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:25,786
Will Francis is your name?

1142
01:00:25,883 --> 01:00:27,013
- Mm.
- Hmm.

1143
01:01:05,048 --> 01:01:07,712
She'll never be his daughter.

1144
01:01:08,114 --> 01:01:12,393
You wish Bea was
Will's daughter, is that it?

1145
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:16,698
I wish she was.

1146
01:01:18,261 --> 01:01:19,603
I wish she was.

1147
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:22,443
Then maybe we'd all be happy.

1148
01:01:26,164 --> 01:01:27,506
I don't want to be cold.

1149
01:01:27,611 --> 01:01:29,242
I don't want to be sad.

1150
01:01:29,339 --> 01:01:33,386
I don't want to be angry
with him anymore.

1151
01:01:38,171 --> 01:01:39,543
I have this light box.

1152
01:01:39,639 --> 01:01:40,721
What kind of light box?

1153
01:01:40,827 --> 01:01:42,112
For depression.

1154
01:01:42,361 --> 01:01:43,416
The doctor prescribed it

1155
01:01:43,512 --> 01:01:45,402
and I sit in front of it
for hours.

1156
01:01:45,498 --> 01:01:48,757
It's supposed to stop me
from getting down.

1157
01:01:48,854 --> 01:01:54,358
Give me an image of that change
that you hope for in Will.

1158
01:01:54,713 --> 01:01:56,535
He's looking at me.

1159
01:01:59,863 --> 01:02:00,755
Sugar?

1160
01:02:00,851 --> 01:02:02,135
Uh, no, thank you.

1161
01:02:02,232 --> 01:02:04,666
I think you'll want sugar.

1162
01:02:06,039 --> 01:02:07,093
Okay.

1163
01:02:15,379 --> 01:02:16,818
Are you unhappy?

1164
01:02:19,829 --> 01:02:21,200
What makes you say that?

1165
01:02:21,296 --> 01:02:26,033
You always seem, when you
come here, I don't know.

1166
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:28,653
I'm happy enough.

1167
01:02:30,032 --> 01:02:31,164
Happy enough.

1168
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:32,785
So English.

1169
01:02:48,502 --> 01:02:52,176
I think it was
the happiest day, really...

1170
01:02:52,273 --> 01:02:53,940
when Bea was born.

1171
01:02:54,928 --> 01:02:57,517
And then sometimes I think...

1172
01:02:58,831 --> 01:03:01,958
sometimes I think
Bea was punished

1173
01:03:02,446 --> 01:03:06,254
because I left my husband
and I left Sweden.

1174
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:09,935
And then I met Will,
and he was kind.

1175
01:03:14,482 --> 01:03:16,880
And we were happy,
we really were.

1176
01:03:16,976 --> 01:03:21,521
But then I just push him away,
I don't know why.

1177
01:03:21,616 --> 01:03:24,360
I just push him away from me.

1178
01:03:30,381 --> 01:03:33,653
Oh, this is, um, this is going
to sound really stupid.

1179
01:03:33,749 --> 01:03:35,215
I forgot the shirt.

1180
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:37,842
I was going to bring a shirt

1181
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:39,982
for you, you to copy and...

1182
01:03:40,078 --> 01:03:41,296
I forgot, I forgot it.

1183
01:03:41,392 --> 01:03:42,676
Um, all right.

1184
01:03:43,252 --> 01:03:44,719
Should I go back and get it?

1185
01:03:44,816 --> 01:03:45,842
I can go back and get it now.

1186
01:03:45,937 --> 01:03:47,952
And I'd be, like, two seconds.

1187
01:03:48,047 --> 01:03:48,978
Okay.

1188
01:03:49,073 --> 01:03:50,676
Or perhaps when you come
for the suit?

1189
01:03:50,770 --> 01:03:52,362
It's a bad time?

1190
01:03:52,755 --> 01:03:55,192
You mean without the shirt?

1191
01:03:55,413 --> 01:03:59,535
Right, that doesn't make
any sense, does it?

1192
01:04:00,561 --> 01:04:01,617
Uh...

1193
01:04:01,741 --> 01:04:03,468
I'm going to the supermarket.

1194
01:04:03,563 --> 01:04:04,905
- Right.
- I have to go to work.

1195
01:04:05,012 --> 01:04:06,930
How do you get
the shopping home?

1196
01:04:07,026 --> 01:04:08,080
Uh, bus.

1197
01:04:08,435 --> 01:04:09,930
I'm practically driving a bus.

1198
01:04:10,027 --> 01:04:12,530
My car's stolen,
so I have a company van.

1199
01:04:12,626 --> 01:04:13,805
It's electric.

1200
01:04:13,901 --> 01:04:14,831
You could probably walk faster.

1201
01:04:14,928 --> 01:04:16,941
Pedestrians will overtake us.

1202
01:04:17,037 --> 01:04:20,394
Say yes, and what's the worst
thing that could happen?

1203
01:04:20,499 --> 01:04:21,554
Yes.

1204
01:04:32,745 --> 01:04:34,605
Tell me about your son.

1205
01:04:34,701 --> 01:04:36,370
- Mirsad?
- Mirsad?

1206
01:04:37,137 --> 01:04:38,191
It's, um...

1207
01:04:40,618 --> 01:04:41,673
He hates his name,

1208
01:04:41,769 --> 01:04:45,807
but was a name for
Sarajevo, not for London.

1209
01:04:45,903 --> 01:04:47,802
Now his name's Miro.

1210
01:04:50,353 --> 01:04:52,462
But I think
he should love his name.

1211
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:53,873
You know, names in my country,

1212
01:04:53,968 --> 01:04:55,714
they're like flags.

1213
01:04:56,049 --> 01:04:59,942
You can live or die
because of your name.

1214
01:05:00,269 --> 01:05:02,024
Mirsad... it's a Muslim name.

1215
01:05:02,129 --> 01:05:04,651
It should be Serbian
because of his father,

1216
01:05:04,747 --> 01:05:07,624
but, you know,
I can be stubborn sometimes.

1217
01:05:07,719 --> 01:05:08,583
You what?

1218
01:05:08,689 --> 01:05:10,280
Stubborn sometimes.

1219
01:05:11,538 --> 01:05:13,033
But that name saved his life.

1220
01:05:13,129 --> 01:05:16,255
When we,
when we were getting out

1221
01:05:16,743 --> 01:05:21,355
of Sarajevo, we came out with
Red Cross, leaving the siege.

1222
01:05:21,452 --> 01:05:25,643
The guards, the Serbs, stopped
us at one of the checkpoints,

1223
01:05:25,739 --> 01:05:27,849
and they took him,
they took my son,

1224
01:05:27,946 --> 01:05:30,025
and they said what's your name?

1225
01:05:30,121 --> 01:05:33,354
And he said, "Mirsad, my name
is Mirsad," his Muslim name.

1226
01:05:33,450 --> 01:05:36,576
Well, if he told
his family name,

1227
01:05:37,543 --> 01:05:39,049
the Serbian name, "Simic,"

1228
01:05:39,146 --> 01:05:43,730
they might have taken him
as a son of a traitor.

1229
01:05:44,075 --> 01:05:49,042
Anyway, since then, I don't
think he's ever really...

1230
01:05:49,542 --> 01:05:51,595
He-he gets in trouble.

1231
01:05:51,882 --> 01:05:53,444
That's another story.

1232
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:57,904
I can't talk about siege
in supermarket, sorry.

1233
01:06:09,958 --> 01:06:11,703
We had a break-in.

1234
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:16,394
Several, actually,
in our office.

1235
01:06:18,886 --> 01:06:19,913
Something gets smashed,

1236
01:06:20,008 --> 01:06:23,518
I mean, I mean,
not just the windows.

1237
01:06:26,826 --> 01:06:29,033
But not all breaking's bad,
is it, you know?

1238
01:06:29,128 --> 01:06:31,238
I mean, you break habits.

1239
01:06:31,334 --> 01:06:35,150
Maybe, maybe before
you repair the window,

1240
01:06:35,716 --> 01:06:38,306
you should smash a few more.

1241
01:06:39,044 --> 01:06:41,673
That's all I do, you see,
in my job, I tidy up.

1242
01:06:41,768 --> 01:06:44,769
There's a mess between
buildings, and we come in.

1243
01:06:44,874 --> 01:06:48,538
Squeeze in bits of green,
like dressing.

1244
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:50,427
Like lipstick,

1245
01:06:50,916 --> 01:06:51,971
like pretty.

1246
01:06:55,146 --> 01:06:59,192
Anyway, that's a roundabout way
of saying...

1247
01:07:01,515 --> 01:07:02,886
the shape of your mouth,

1248
01:07:02,981 --> 01:07:06,185
I could probably
draw it by heart.

1249
01:07:12,198 --> 01:07:14,058
What are you thinking?

1250
01:07:14,154 --> 01:07:18,247
I was thinking,
uh, that was a roundabout way

1251
01:07:18,344 --> 01:07:20,166
of saying you're married,
which I know,

1252
01:07:20,262 --> 01:07:21,931
and I was thinking

1253
01:07:22,795 --> 01:07:25,699
Bosnian men would say less,
but, uh...

1254
01:07:25,796 --> 01:07:27,233
would want more.

1255
01:07:28,931 --> 01:07:32,162
They love to talk, they love
talk, believe me, but, uh,

1256
01:07:32,257 --> 01:07:36,162
talk for them is politics,
women for them is not talk.

1257
01:07:36,258 --> 01:07:37,697
That's crushing.

1258
01:07:40,774 --> 01:07:42,826
I didn't mean it bad.

1259
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,594
She's going to be
disappointed, but okay.

1260
01:07:54,690 --> 01:07:58,582
Yeah. I have to take
the boys to cricket.

1261
01:08:01,096 --> 01:08:02,152
Here's Mom.

1262
01:08:02,343 --> 01:08:04,087
Dad can't make it.

1263
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:05,345
Aw...

1264
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:06,399
But here's what
we're going to do.

1265
01:08:06,496 --> 01:08:07,263
It's okay.
Look, sweet...

1266
01:08:07,358 --> 01:08:08,481
Why can't Dad come?

1267
01:08:08,576 --> 01:08:10,274
Because he's working.
He can't make it in time.

1268
01:08:10,370 --> 01:08:11,233
He never comes.

1269
01:08:11,329 --> 01:08:12,613
We have the videos,
video, video, video.

1270
01:08:12,708 --> 01:08:13,764
Hey! Hoopla.

1271
01:08:14,244 --> 01:08:16,641
Stop. That stop there
is very good.

1272
01:08:16,738 --> 01:08:18,406
I know. I realize.

1273
01:08:19,777 --> 01:08:20,908
Again, again.

1274
01:08:21,062 --> 01:08:22,577
- Again?
- Again.

1275
01:08:24,677 --> 01:08:26,346
What do you think?

1276
01:08:26,499 --> 01:08:27,843
- She's great, eh?
- Great.

1277
01:08:27,939 --> 01:08:28,964
It's good, too,

1278
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:31,678
because the batteries
are back in the remote.

1279
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:34,085
It's a mystery how these
batteries finally went home

1280
01:08:34,181 --> 01:08:36,223
just when we need them.

1281
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:37,373
Big mystery.

1282
01:08:38,976 --> 01:08:42,237
Mystery two:
How did you video this

1283
01:08:42,333 --> 01:08:43,810
and be in the picture
at the same time?

1284
01:08:43,905 --> 01:08:44,930
Paul was cameraman.

1285
01:08:45,027 --> 01:08:46,398
- Paul?
- Bea's trainer.

1286
01:08:46,493 --> 01:08:47,683
You've met him a hundred times.

1287
01:08:47,778 --> 01:08:48,959
Paul loves Mom.

1288
01:08:49,056 --> 01:08:50,800
No, Paul loves Bea.

1289
01:08:52,163 --> 01:08:53,216
But...

1290
01:08:54,779 --> 01:08:56,448
does Paul love me?

1291
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:17,767
If you could do anything
right now, what would it be?

1292
01:09:18,179 --> 01:09:20,318
I have to work,
I have to get back.

1293
01:09:20,413 --> 01:09:21,546
Oh, come on.

1294
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:25,124
Let me think.
I don't know, uh...

1295
01:09:25,630 --> 01:09:28,412
Change everything up
until this moment.

1296
01:09:28,508 --> 01:09:31,404
Uh, not my son, everything else.

1297
01:09:31,835 --> 01:09:34,195
I can't do that for you.

1298
01:09:34,942 --> 01:09:37,724
You didn't say
what could you do.

1299
01:09:37,819 --> 01:09:39,546
What would I do is what you
said, not what you could do.

1300
01:09:39,641 --> 01:09:41,157
What could I do?

1301
01:09:44,571 --> 01:09:45,626
Why?

1302
01:09:46,557 --> 01:09:48,705
I-I-I don't understand.

1303
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:51,235
I don't understand, either.

1304
01:09:56,155 --> 01:09:59,482
If I had a magic
wand, I don't know,

1305
01:09:59,578 --> 01:10:01,851
persuade my son to come
to Sarajevo with me,

1306
01:10:01,947 --> 01:10:03,539
start a new life.

1307
01:10:07,385 --> 01:10:10,944
And you, if you could
do anything right now,

1308
01:10:11,039 --> 01:10:12,709
what would you do?

1309
01:10:17,532 --> 01:10:19,124
I'm sorry. Sorry.

1310
01:10:19,392 --> 01:10:20,448
I'm sorry.

1311
01:10:58,998 --> 01:11:01,128
Hey, are you waking up?

1312
01:11:01,914 --> 01:11:02,844
Mm-hmm.

1313
01:11:02,940 --> 01:11:04,147
I made bread.

1314
01:11:04,886 --> 01:11:06,478
I can smell them.

1315
01:11:07,993 --> 01:11:09,662
It's hot. Careful.

1316
01:11:16,346 --> 01:11:17,555
You're happy.

1317
01:11:19,673 --> 01:11:21,420
Is that so strange?

1318
01:11:23,578 --> 01:11:25,688
Put on the telly;
it might be on the news.

1319
01:11:25,784 --> 01:11:29,753
Ha! You are not so big
I can sit on you.

1320
01:11:32,574 --> 01:11:33,628
Mm...

1321
01:11:34,165 --> 01:11:35,220
Ah, Miro.

1322
01:11:36,475 --> 01:11:37,531
Hmm...

1323
01:11:39,285 --> 01:11:42,066
We should go home this
summer to Sarajevo.

1324
01:11:42,172 --> 01:11:44,607
I think you would love it.

1325
01:11:45,116 --> 01:11:48,214
Tanja says there are
flights for a few pounds.

1326
01:11:48,309 --> 01:11:49,365
Maybe.

1327
01:11:50,554 --> 01:11:51,609
Hmm.

1328
01:11:53,555 --> 01:11:54,610
Maybe.

1329
01:11:56,538 --> 01:11:59,895
Your grandmother
would cry for weeks.

1330
01:12:00,182 --> 01:12:01,236
Great.

1331
01:12:39,444 --> 01:12:40,576
What's this?

1332
01:12:41,687 --> 01:12:43,509
Oh, uh, I-I forgot.

1333
01:12:44,305 --> 01:12:45,907
- I put it in your room.
- Where'd you get it?

1334
01:12:46,002 --> 01:12:47,095
It's a customer.

1335
01:12:47,192 --> 01:12:48,056
I sewed his jacket.

1336
01:12:48,152 --> 01:12:49,234
He's an architect.

1337
01:12:49,330 --> 01:12:50,999
He said, uh, you could go
and look at his office.

1338
01:12:51,094 --> 01:12:52,629
What's the matter?

1339
01:12:52,725 --> 01:12:53,588
I have to go out.

1340
01:12:53,684 --> 01:12:54,547
What did you say to him?

1341
01:12:54,643 --> 01:12:56,849
Wh-Wh-What do you mean?

1342
01:12:57,175 --> 01:12:58,133
Did he go in my room?!

1343
01:12:58,228 --> 01:13:00,147
No. Just to try some trousers.

1344
01:13:00,244 --> 01:13:01,874
Why do people have
to go into my room?!

1345
01:13:01,969 --> 01:13:03,859
Miro, dushma, he's a good
person, he's a good man.

1346
01:13:03,955 --> 01:13:05,077
He was just trying to help.

1347
01:13:05,173 --> 01:13:06,514
You think everyone is good.

1348
01:13:06,610 --> 01:13:08,049
No one is good.

1349
01:13:13,458 --> 01:13:14,820
What are you...

1350
01:13:16,565 --> 01:13:17,620
What is it?

1351
01:13:18,224 --> 01:13:19,893
I'm in such shit.

1352
01:13:29,013 --> 01:13:31,151
She's taken back the laptop.

1353
01:13:31,248 --> 01:13:32,303
She what?

1354
01:13:32,534 --> 01:13:34,547
She's taken back the laptop.

1355
01:13:34,643 --> 01:13:36,619
That is so fucked up.

1356
01:13:38,957 --> 01:13:40,204
She says they're friends.

1357
01:13:40,310 --> 01:13:42,612
Yeah, but that's like,
"Hello, my son did it.

1358
01:13:42,708 --> 01:13:43,916
Lock him up."

1359
01:13:44,559 --> 01:13:48,624
She says she's going to talk
to him, do some sort of deal.

1360
01:13:48,721 --> 01:13:49,775
Papa.
Papa.

1361
01:13:59,758 --> 01:14:00,660
Will!

1362
01:14:00,755 --> 01:14:01,676
What?

1363
01:14:01,773 --> 01:14:03,670
Lady looking for you.

1364
01:14:03,987 --> 01:14:05,042
What?

1365
01:14:05,427 --> 01:14:07,862
A lady is looking for you.

1366
01:14:24,816 --> 01:14:25,997
Are you okay?

1367
01:14:26,093 --> 01:14:27,405
What is it you want from me?

1368
01:14:27,502 --> 01:14:28,719
Nothing, I don't want anything.

1369
01:14:28,816 --> 01:14:30,638
Because you don't just walk
into someone's life

1370
01:14:30,733 --> 01:14:32,557
and knock on their door
and kiss them.

1371
01:14:32,652 --> 01:14:33,842
- You cannot do that.
- I know that.

1372
01:14:33,937 --> 01:14:35,442
What? What-what's the matter?

1373
01:14:35,538 --> 01:14:36,785
You used me;
you have someone else.

1374
01:14:36,882 --> 01:14:38,253
- Oh, you mean Liv?
- Promise me, promise me.

1375
01:14:38,348 --> 01:14:39,375
That's the last thing I want,
believe...

1376
01:14:39,471 --> 01:14:40,651
Promise you what?

1377
01:14:40,746 --> 01:14:42,002
Promise you I'm not flirting?

1378
01:14:42,099 --> 01:14:43,440
- I know what that is.
- I don't believe you.

1379
01:14:43,536 --> 01:14:44,687
I know what that is,

1380
01:14:44,783 --> 01:14:46,125
- and this is not what it is.
- I don't believe you.

1381
01:14:46,222 --> 01:14:47,276
I don't...

1382
01:14:50,058 --> 01:14:51,822
I can't talk anymore.

1383
01:14:51,918 --> 01:14:54,507
I want to go somewhere
and not talk.

1384
01:14:54,603 --> 01:14:55,658
Not talk.

1385
01:14:58,929 --> 01:15:01,613
I have a friend;
she... she works.

1386
01:15:01,710 --> 01:15:04,529
Maybe she would lend her place.

1387
01:15:04,912 --> 01:15:06,024
It's close to here.

1388
01:15:06,121 --> 01:15:07,175
Call her.

1389
01:15:07,473 --> 01:15:08,651
It's not a hotel,
it's not a palace

1390
01:15:08,747 --> 01:15:09,804
Call her.

1391
01:15:11,626 --> 01:15:13,294
What's her number?

1392
01:16:42,538 --> 01:16:46,584
The clothes under my
clothes, they're not...

1393
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:51,860
I've always wanted to
make something in silk.

1394
01:16:57,450 --> 01:17:00,270
I'm, uh, giving myself to you.

1395
01:17:00,932 --> 01:17:03,904
I want it to be worth something.

1396
01:17:06,090 --> 01:17:07,145
Come here.

1397
01:18:54,054 --> 01:18:55,110
- Hi.
- Hi.

1398
01:18:56,834 --> 01:19:01,477
I'm, uh, I never met somebody
when I was already in their bed.

1399
01:19:01,572 --> 01:19:02,628
I'm Will.

1400
01:19:02,973 --> 01:19:04,028
Thank you.

1401
01:19:04,995 --> 01:19:06,051
I'm Tanja.

1402
01:19:06,491 --> 01:19:08,612
It's good to have
a man in my bed.

1403
01:19:08,707 --> 01:19:10,837
I hope it's contagious.

1404
01:19:12,831 --> 01:19:14,576
I'll get my, uh...

1405
01:19:38,301 --> 01:19:41,821
"'Don't kill the boy,'
Brave Benoit said,

1406
01:19:41,917 --> 01:19:43,432
"but Dai replied,

1407
01:19:43,739 --> 01:19:47,421
"'Why not? I come
from the Isle of Wight.

1408
01:19:47,517 --> 01:19:49,531
"We eat young boys a lot.'

1409
01:19:49,627 --> 01:19:52,447
"But secretly, Dai had a heart.

1410
01:19:53,023 --> 01:19:55,074
"He kept it in a jar.

1411
01:19:55,419 --> 01:19:57,625
"He hadn't seen
that jar for years.

1412
01:19:57,722 --> 01:19:59,965
He found it in his car."

1413
01:20:00,062 --> 01:20:01,269
Great reading.

1414
01:20:01,443 --> 01:20:03,936
That's not reading,
that's knowing by heart.

1415
01:20:04,032 --> 01:20:05,375
There's a metaphor.

1416
01:20:05,470 --> 01:20:06,525
Where?

1417
01:20:06,813 --> 01:20:08,405
To know by heart.

1418
01:20:09,498 --> 01:20:15,233
"'Forgive, forget, and eat more
jam,' the jar said on the lid.

1419
01:20:16,096 --> 01:20:19,528
"Dai ate some jam
and thought a lot,

1420
01:20:19,673 --> 01:20:21,955
"and in the end, he did.

1421

it's tricky.

"There is a moral to this tale:

1424

Jam makes fingers sticky."

1425
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:39,063
Well done.

1426
01:20:39,159 --> 01:20:40,214
Sticky jam.

1427
01:20:41,432 --> 01:20:42,947
Okay, my sweetie.

1428
01:20:44,059 --> 01:20:47,186
It is now time
for you and bunny

1429
01:20:47,359 --> 01:20:49,027
to get some sleep.

1430
01:21:00,698 --> 01:21:02,654
You're a monkey,
be a wise monkey.

1431
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:06,012
Somebody asks you a question,
you know nothing,

1432
01:21:06,107 --> 01:21:07,449
you see nothing,

1433
01:21:07,545 --> 01:21:09,061
you hear nothing.

1434
01:21:09,694 --> 01:21:11,516
I'm not a monkey for sure.

1435
01:21:11,612 --> 01:21:14,460
Your mother's a Muslim dog.
They have loose tongues.

1436
01:21:14,556 --> 01:21:17,048
Are you my brother's son,
or your mother's?

1437
01:21:17,145 --> 01:21:18,583
We'll find out.

1438
01:21:19,735 --> 01:21:20,982
And you don't come
to the car wash.

1439
01:21:21,087 --> 01:21:23,291
You don't come to our house...

1440
01:21:23,388 --> 01:21:27,195
If the police find anything,
we're all going to prison...

1441
01:21:27,291 --> 01:21:28,346
Hurry up!

1442
01:21:42,971 --> 01:21:46,020
You're a thief... I'll kill you!

1443
01:21:46,557 --> 01:21:47,516
Go ahead, dent the dents.

1444
01:21:47,612 --> 01:21:49,587
Get away from my boy!

1445
01:21:49,884 --> 01:21:54,622
It's no wonder my brother
was fucking someone else.

1446
01:21:59,061 --> 01:22:00,567
I don't want you
in this house!

1447
01:22:00,664 --> 01:22:03,330
- Sure, whatever.
- Understand?

1448
01:22:07,673 --> 01:22:08,730
Mirsad.

1449
01:22:14,647 --> 01:22:16,565
Why didn't you give it back?

1450
01:22:16,660 --> 01:22:18,099
I will, I will.

1451
01:22:19,163 --> 01:22:20,851
I will give it back.

1452
01:22:20,946 --> 01:22:22,423
I don't get it.

1453
01:22:22,519 --> 01:22:24,082
He knows, doesn't he?

1454
01:22:24,178 --> 01:22:27,612
Why doesn't he just
tell the police?

1455
01:22:28,082 --> 01:22:29,597
I don't get it.

1456
01:22:58,098 --> 01:22:59,153
Will?

1457
01:22:59,632 --> 01:23:00,688
Yeah.

1458
01:23:03,190 --> 01:23:04,369
You should come and see this.

1459
01:23:04,465 --> 01:23:06,901
- What?
- Come... come see.

1460
01:23:14,199 --> 01:23:15,562
Just left here.

1461
01:23:16,502 --> 01:23:17,939
Keys are inside.

1462
01:23:43,477 --> 01:23:44,944
What does that mean?

1463
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:46,326
I don't know.

1464
01:23:47,821 --> 01:23:51,792
Will, is there something
going on with you?

1465
01:23:52,243 --> 01:23:53,528
I don't know.

1466
01:23:58,006 --> 01:23:59,635
Something's going on with me.

1467
01:23:59,732 --> 01:24:01,937
Erika, you know, Erika...

1468
01:24:02,321 --> 01:24:05,065
...forgave me, and, uh, well...

1469
01:24:06,225 --> 01:24:08,976
It's early doors, but you know,

1470
01:24:09,072 --> 01:24:12,122
you know,
lattes have been drunk.

1471
01:24:14,261 --> 01:24:15,468
That's great.

1472
01:24:16,303 --> 01:24:18,739
Sandy, can we go somewhere?
Can we drive somewhere now?

1473
01:24:18,836 --> 01:24:20,303
- Will...
- Anywhere?

1474
01:24:20,399 --> 01:24:22,068
Don't tell me
you're fooling around, okay?

1475
01:24:22,164 --> 01:24:23,985
I'm just entering fidelity;
don't exit.

1476
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:25,520
It's not about fooling around.

1477
01:24:25,616 --> 01:24:28,666
It's always
about fooling around.

1478
01:24:31,187 --> 01:24:32,319
Fucking hell.

1479
01:24:42,897 --> 01:24:45,409
Will, I've, I've got to...

1480
01:24:45,581 --> 01:24:47,097
and so have you.

1481
01:25:04,109 --> 01:25:05,163
Oi!

1482
01:25:06,026 --> 01:25:07,754
Where do you
think you're going?

1483
01:25:07,850 --> 01:25:09,068
Get on the back.

1484
01:25:09,163 --> 01:25:10,286
I'm late for school.

1485
01:25:10,381 --> 01:25:13,228
Yeah, two years late...
get on the back.

1486
01:25:13,324 --> 01:25:16,374
You're in a lot of trouble, son.

1487
01:25:17,544 --> 01:25:21,514
Put your helmet on;
it makes you invisible.

1488
01:25:22,924 --> 01:25:25,035
And don't stab me
while I'm driving.

1489
01:25:25,130 --> 01:25:26,646
You'll fall off.

1490
01:25:32,362 --> 01:25:33,609
Everybody's chasing around
looking for evidence...

1491
01:25:33,704 --> 01:25:35,153
fingerprints, DNA.

1492
01:25:35,248 --> 01:25:36,494
I just look at the buildings

1493
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:38,863
and I know it's you.
I know.

1494
01:25:38,959 --> 01:25:41,549
Someone's doing very well,
and you're not.

1495
01:25:41,645 --> 01:25:44,809
I mean, what do you earn,
a few quid, pair of trainers?

1496
01:25:44,904 --> 01:25:47,369
You're the bit
you spit out to your friends...

1497
01:25:47,465 --> 01:25:49,479
whoever they are...
and I know who they are.

1498
01:25:49,575 --> 01:25:51,274
They're not your friends.

1499
01:25:51,369 --> 01:25:52,462
How long are we staying?

1500
01:25:52,558 --> 01:25:54,302
Ah... she's lovely.

1501
01:25:58,734 --> 01:26:01,226
They should tip London on its
side and let a few million

1502
01:26:01,322 --> 01:26:02,636
people slide right off, you see?

1503
01:26:02,732 --> 01:26:04,171
There's no air.

1504
01:26:05,772 --> 01:26:08,208
There's no air in a cell.

1505
01:26:08,717 --> 01:26:09,770
None.

1506
01:26:10,508 --> 01:26:13,934
And that's where
you're going, no question,

1507
01:26:14,030 --> 01:26:16,005
and that's a tragedy.

1508
01:26:27,723 --> 01:26:30,534
Which of us is lying the most?

1509
01:26:30,630 --> 01:26:31,685
About what?

1510
01:26:33,037 --> 01:26:36,230
That's not even
the right question.

1511
01:26:36,327 --> 01:26:39,175
Which of us is lying
to themselves the most?

1512
01:26:39,270 --> 01:26:40,325
What?

1513
01:26:40,939 --> 01:26:41,993
About this.

1514
01:26:44,103 --> 01:26:45,465
I'm not lying.

1515
01:26:49,607 --> 01:26:50,816
I have, um...

1516
01:26:52,139 --> 01:26:53,271
a photograph.

1517
01:26:54,125 --> 01:26:55,486
What photograph?

1518
01:26:55,879 --> 01:26:56,936
Of us.

1519
01:26:57,741 --> 01:26:58,795
It's, uh...

1520
01:26:59,428 --> 01:27:02,506
incriminating is-is
the right the word.

1521
01:27:02,602 --> 01:27:04,808
I don't know
if it's the right word,

1522
01:27:04,904 --> 01:27:07,368
unless I know
what you're talking about.

1523
01:27:07,465 --> 01:27:08,902
It took me a...

1524
01:27:09,804 --> 01:27:13,122
a little while to make
sense of the jacket.

1525
01:27:13,228 --> 01:27:16,353
You suddenly
appearing at my door.

1526
01:27:16,871 --> 01:27:19,998
That you'd been
following my son.

1527
01:27:20,938 --> 01:27:22,529
You must know that mothers

1528
01:27:22,635 --> 01:27:26,500
will do anything to protect
their children.

1529
01:27:26,595 --> 01:27:29,186
Why-Why would you
take a photograph?

1530
01:27:29,291 --> 01:27:32,647
Was that when your
friend came back?

1531
01:27:33,539 --> 01:27:35,074
Why would you do that?

1532
01:27:35,170 --> 01:27:37,222
Why would you do this?

1533
01:27:38,755 --> 01:27:41,863
You steal someone's heart;
that's a real crime.

1534
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:44,520
And then what?
You call the police?

1535
01:27:44,616 --> 01:27:45,671
No.

1536
01:27:46,150 --> 01:27:47,972
I don't know... No!

1537
01:27:48,355 --> 01:27:50,561
Did you know how long...

1538
01:27:56,104 --> 01:28:00,381
Do you know how long
since anybody touched me?

1539
01:28:00,639 --> 01:28:03,431
I should have told you, I know.
I should have said something.

1540
01:28:03,527 --> 01:28:05,195
It wasn't a plan.

1541
01:28:05,732 --> 01:28:09,952
It wasn't a plan...
it was you, that's the truth.

1542
01:28:10,048 --> 01:28:11,553
I have to get out.

1543
01:28:11,648 --> 01:28:13,414
Is that why you come
to bed with me?

1544
01:28:13,510 --> 01:28:15,111
For what, a photograph?

1545
01:28:15,208 --> 01:28:16,262
How squalid.

1546
01:28:19,494 --> 01:28:21,162
The water is cold.

1547
01:28:22,274 --> 01:28:23,838
But what about?
But it...

1548
01:28:23,944 --> 01:28:24,932
It doesn't make any sense.

1549
01:28:25,027 --> 01:28:26,015
What about today?

1550
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:27,166
Or now?

1551
01:28:28,095 --> 01:28:29,860
Look, a lie, that's
right. That's my...

1552
01:28:29,956 --> 01:28:31,778
That's me...
I lie, I lie.

1553
01:28:31,874 --> 01:28:34,271
Can't we drawn a line and
say no more lies between us?

1554
01:28:34,368 --> 01:28:35,576
No more lies.

1555
01:28:35,873 --> 01:28:38,404
No, I have to ask you to lie,
to continue to lie.

1556
01:28:38,501 --> 01:28:41,926
I have to beg you
not to report my son.

1557
01:28:42,021 --> 01:28:44,763
That's what this is: A bribe.

1558
01:28:46,337 --> 01:28:47,469
If you like.

1559
01:28:56,608 --> 01:28:58,689
I'm, um... not stopping.

1560
01:28:58,785 --> 01:29:01,527
Old Bill's been at our place.

1561
01:29:02,150 --> 01:29:05,535
He says he's going to
try and charge my dad.

1562
01:29:05,631 --> 01:29:07,109
You shouldn't be here.

1563
01:29:07,205 --> 01:29:09,285
What if they followed you?
Then what?

1564
01:29:09,381 --> 01:29:13,216
So? There's nothing for them
to find here, is there?

1565
01:29:13,313 --> 01:29:14,531
They've been down
the car wash, as well,

1566
01:29:14,627 --> 01:29:15,490
making out with
all this evidence.

1567
01:29:15,585 --> 01:29:19,173
They've got nothing.
Trust me, nothing.

1568
01:29:22,749 --> 01:29:23,804
Hey!

1569
01:29:23,939 --> 01:29:25,529
Zoran! The laptop!

1570
01:29:25,951 --> 01:29:28,080
They'll find my laptop!

1571
01:29:29,156 --> 01:29:30,210
Oi!

1572
01:29:32,732 --> 01:29:33,787
Up there!

1573
01:29:34,659 --> 01:29:35,714
Come on!

1574
01:29:40,319 --> 01:29:42,293
Get to the other end.

1575
01:29:42,495 --> 01:29:44,470
- Come on!
- Come on!

1576
01:29:49,984 --> 01:29:50,819
Don't do it!

1577
01:29:50,916 --> 01:29:51,970
Hey!

1578
01:29:55,834 --> 01:29:57,120
Little bastards are going

1579
01:29:57,216 --> 01:30:01,953
through Eastern Avenue,
Eastern Avenue, on their way!

1580
01:30:12,828 --> 01:30:13,883
The towpath!

1581
01:30:17,593 --> 01:30:18,649
Miro!

1582
01:30:18,754 --> 01:30:20,730
- Miro!
- I'll head him off.

1583
01:30:20,826 --> 01:30:21,879
Miro!
Miro!

1584
01:30:25,151 --> 01:30:27,280
Don't, don't move him.

1585
01:30:28,028 --> 01:30:28,862
Come on!

1586
01:30:28,958 --> 01:30:30,011
Don't move!

1587
01:31:50,550 --> 01:31:51,603
I'm sorry.

1588
01:32:01,751 --> 01:32:03,448
You going to be okay?

1589
01:32:03,543 --> 01:32:04,570
Uh-huh.

1590
01:32:04,666 --> 01:32:06,296
Show Mommy she can go
to her work,

1591
01:32:06,392 --> 01:32:07,829
we can do ours.

1592
01:32:08,281 --> 01:32:09,335
Hmm?

1593
01:32:10,649 --> 01:32:12,779
Wei Ping, can you just?

1594
01:32:12,952 --> 01:32:14,227
Exactly as it says
on the model.

1595
01:32:14,332 --> 01:32:15,541
Number nine needs to go left.

1596
01:32:15,637 --> 01:32:16,691
All right, take it back, please.

1597
01:32:16,787 --> 01:32:17,650
Yeah, way left.

1598
01:32:17,755 --> 01:32:19,270
To the very end.

1599
01:32:19,606 --> 01:32:22,234
At least three feet to the left.

1600
01:32:22,330 --> 01:32:23,290
The model's not bad.

1601
01:32:23,385 --> 01:32:24,315
Number nine is.

1602
01:32:24,411 --> 01:32:25,207
Way back!

1603
01:32:25,302 --> 01:32:26,194
- Will?
- Yeah?

1604
01:32:26,291 --> 01:32:27,153
A couple colleagues of mine.

1605
01:32:27,259 --> 01:32:28,697
This is Erin and Lorna,
this is Mr. Francis.

1606
01:32:28,794 --> 01:32:29,656
- Hello.
- Hello.

1607
01:32:29,753 --> 01:32:31,507
Was a fair result all
around on the burglary,

1608
01:32:31,604 --> 01:32:34,711
and the DNA matched, and we got
most of your stolen goods back.

1609
01:32:34,805 --> 01:32:37,750
Yes, Sandy said, um,
he's a young boy?

1610
01:32:37,847 --> 01:32:38,834
Yeah, he's 15.

1611
01:32:38,930 --> 01:32:39,985
He's been in and out of trouble.

1612
01:32:40,090 --> 01:32:41,653
You know, final warning.

1613
01:32:41,748 --> 01:32:42,804
He's going to prison.

1614
01:32:42,899 --> 01:32:44,723
If he gets
convicted he will, yes.

1615
01:32:44,818 --> 01:32:46,391
He'll go to Youth
Detention Center.

1616
01:32:46,487 --> 01:32:47,925
Is this your computer, Will?

1617
01:32:48,021 --> 01:32:49,268
It's got all your files on it.

1618
01:32:49,363 --> 01:32:50,772
Well, then it must be.
Great.

1619
01:32:50,869 --> 01:32:52,787
Well, I'm afraid
we're going to have to keep it

1620
01:32:52,882 --> 01:32:54,100
just until the case
comes to court.

1621
01:32:54,196 --> 01:32:55,406
Bea? Bea, no!

1622
01:32:56,442 --> 01:32:57,524
- Bea!
- Wei Ping, could you just?

1623
01:32:57,620 --> 01:32:58,550
I'm okay, I'm fine.

1624
01:32:58,647 --> 01:33:00,248
Darling, stay with Wei Ping.

1625
01:33:00,344 --> 01:33:01,687
This is a hollow victory for us,
ain't it, girls?

1626
01:33:01,783 --> 01:33:02,675
It is, yeah.

1627
01:33:02,771 --> 01:33:04,056
I mean, he's just
the little runt

1628
01:33:04,152 --> 01:33:05,263
who's done all the dirty work.

1629
01:33:05,369 --> 01:33:07,537
We can't make a case
against the adults.

1630
01:33:07,634 --> 01:33:09,206
They're the real villains.

1631
01:33:09,302 --> 01:33:10,194
Yeah, it's hollow.

1632
01:33:10,289 --> 01:33:11,479
Well, you may find it hollow,

1633
01:33:11,574 --> 01:33:13,329
we find it whatever
is the opposite of hollow.

1634
01:33:13,424 --> 01:33:14,480
Of course, we understand.

1635
01:33:14,585 --> 01:33:15,927
Because actually, it's been
like a siege, okay?

1636
01:33:16,024 --> 01:33:18,450
We have felt under siege,
and worse than that,

1637
01:33:18,547 --> 01:33:20,369
innocent people have been
wrongly accused, our cleaners,

1638
01:33:20,465 --> 01:33:21,585
you know, it's very degrading.

1639
01:33:21,682 --> 01:33:22,871
It's because we know the boy,
you know?

1640
01:33:22,967 --> 01:33:24,271
I mean, there's nothing wrong
with him.

1641
01:33:24,376 --> 01:33:26,390
Nothing wrong? He's a thief,
that's what's wrong with him.

1642
01:33:26,486 --> 01:33:27,349
Well, there's no question.

1643
01:33:27,445 --> 01:33:30,878
Will, all this
is about some court...

1644
01:33:31,348 --> 01:33:33,966
- It's not a court.
- Conciliation court.

1645
01:33:34,072 --> 01:33:36,431
Whereby, if we go along
to meet the boy...

1646
01:33:36,527 --> 01:33:37,294
What is it?

1647
01:33:37,399 --> 01:33:38,770
Explain, it's a Camden thing.

1648
01:33:38,866 --> 01:33:40,180
He gets let off, hooray.

1649
01:33:40,277 --> 01:33:41,456
It's not a court.

1650
01:33:41,552 --> 01:33:43,346
Me and Lorna, we work
on the Youth Offenders team,

1651
01:33:43,442 --> 01:33:45,905
and we encourage the offenders
to face their victims.

1652
01:33:46,001 --> 01:33:48,082
Right, so we go to the court,
arrange to meet him...

1653
01:33:48,178 --> 01:33:49,712
Not a court, sorry,
whatever court it is,

1654
01:33:49,809 --> 01:33:51,124
and he might not go to prison?

1655
01:33:51,219 --> 01:33:52,082
Yeah, that's right, yeah.

1656
01:33:52,178 --> 01:33:53,846
The law's an ass.

1657
01:33:54,546 --> 01:33:56,176
Look, he's a boy.

1658
01:33:56,272 --> 01:33:57,711
The last thing he needs
is prison.

1659
01:33:57,806 --> 01:34:01,326
You know he's a Bosnian
boy, and his mom, well,

1660
01:34:01,423 --> 01:34:02,669
well, they're refugees,

1661
01:34:02,774 --> 01:34:04,558
and his mom's,
his mom's in pieces.

1662
01:34:04,654 --> 01:34:06,419
Mr. Francis,
what do you think?

1663
01:34:06,515 --> 01:34:07,790
You've been very quiet.

1664
01:34:07,886 --> 01:34:12,049
I just, I want to draw a line
under the whole thing.

1665
01:34:12,144 --> 01:34:13,200
Bea!

1666
01:34:20,180 --> 01:34:22,319
Somebody call an ambulance!

1667
01:34:22,414 --> 01:34:24,237
I'm so sorry! I am so sorry!

1668
01:34:24,333 --> 01:34:25,263
All right, don't move.

1669
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:26,548
It's gonna be all right.

1670
01:34:26,644 --> 01:34:28,543
I'm here, I'm here.

1671
01:34:32,877 --> 01:34:34,163
I'm so sorry.

1672
01:34:44,271 --> 01:34:45,230
Hi, sweetie.

1673
01:34:45,324 --> 01:34:46,639
My fibula's broken, two places.

1674
01:34:46,734 --> 01:34:47,790
Ouch.

1675
01:34:47,981 --> 01:34:50,474
And they have to put wires in
to fix it.

1676
01:34:50,581 --> 01:34:51,443
Oh.

1677
01:34:51,538 --> 01:34:53,610
The doctor said, she said what?

1678
01:34:53,715 --> 01:34:56,402
She said that I'd be up
and climbing again in no time.

1679
01:34:56,498 --> 01:34:58,608
Hmm. We've got an X-ray
if you want to see.

1680
01:34:58,703 --> 01:34:59,499
Definitely.

1681
01:34:59,594 --> 01:35:00,649
Sorry.

1682
01:35:01,579 --> 01:35:02,730
Oh, sweetie, don't be sorry.

1683
01:35:02,826 --> 01:35:03,785
I'm sorry.

1684
01:35:03,891 --> 01:35:05,099
I'm sorriest.

1685
01:35:05,425 --> 01:35:07,698
- Daddy cried.
- I did not.

1686
01:35:07,793 --> 01:35:09,261
I laughed on the wrong
side of my face.

1687
01:35:09,356 --> 01:35:11,794
- Is it hurting?
- It did.

1688
01:35:12,945 --> 01:35:14,316
We had painkillers.

1689
01:35:14,412 --> 01:35:15,658
Bea had two, daddy had four.

1690
01:35:15,753 --> 01:35:16,885
You did not.

1691
01:35:17,232 --> 01:35:20,559
So, listen, Mommy's going
to stay, okay?

1692
01:35:20,655 --> 01:35:21,585
And I brought everything.

1693
01:35:21,681 --> 01:35:23,196
I brought Stuffy.

1694
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:25,870
This hospital's very peculiar.

1695
01:35:25,967 --> 01:35:27,050
They don't understand
color, do they?

1696
01:35:27,146 --> 01:35:28,969
Tried to put us
in a yellow room.

1697
01:35:29,075 --> 01:35:30,284
I need to speak to Mommy.

1698
01:35:30,379 --> 01:35:31,588
Mommy's here.

1699
01:35:32,498 --> 01:35:33,994
I need to speak
to Mommy by myself.

1700
01:35:34,090 --> 01:35:35,144
Will?

1701
01:35:36,141 --> 01:35:37,197
Okay.

1702
01:35:42,346 --> 01:35:44,782
You have four new messages.

1703
01:35:46,125 --> 01:35:47,880
Hello, Will, it's Amira.

1704
01:35:47,976 --> 01:35:49,039
I need to see you.

1705
01:35:49,135 --> 01:35:51,054
Uh, call me. Thank you.

1706
01:35:51,150 --> 01:35:53,893
Hello, Will, it's Amira. Uh...

1707
01:36:00,424 --> 01:36:01,479
I'm sorry.

1708
01:36:03,464 --> 01:36:07,126
First of all, I want
to give you this,

1709
01:36:07,597 --> 01:36:09,648
which are the pictures.

1710
01:36:13,638 --> 01:36:15,211
I wish, I wish
they hadn't caught him.

1711
01:36:15,306 --> 01:36:17,743
I wish I hadn't hurt you.

1712
01:36:18,952 --> 01:36:20,007
Truly.

1713
01:36:20,744 --> 01:36:21,895
Then help me. Help him.

1714
01:36:21,991 --> 01:36:23,046
I can't.

1715
01:36:24,975 --> 01:36:27,631
This meeting with Miro and
police, if you came, it would...

1716
01:36:27,726 --> 01:36:29,164
I really can't.

1717
01:36:29,807 --> 01:36:31,629
He'll go to prison.

1718
01:36:33,902 --> 01:36:35,178
He's agreed, Miro.

1719
01:36:35,274 --> 01:36:37,929
If you help him, he'll come
back with me to Sarajevo.

1720
01:36:38,026 --> 01:36:39,972
He won't say anything in court
except he's sorry,

1721
01:36:40,078 --> 01:36:41,229
I promise you.

1722
01:36:41,324 --> 01:36:44,078
You're a good person;
I know you.

1723
01:36:44,173 --> 01:36:46,408
- Don't do that. Don't do that.
- Please.

1724
01:36:46,503 --> 01:36:47,654
- Don't do that.
- Please.

1725
01:36:47,750 --> 01:36:49,515
Amira, I can't,
I can't do what you want.

1726
01:36:49,610 --> 01:36:50,665
How can I?

1727
01:36:50,828 --> 01:36:53,483
If I meet your son, it will come
out that I know you,

1728
01:36:53,580 --> 01:36:54,952
how I know you.

1729
01:36:55,047 --> 01:36:55,978
Please, help me.

1730
01:36:56,074 --> 01:36:58,539
I can't help you.
I can't help you.

1731
01:36:58,635 --> 01:36:59,910
I can't.
I'm sorry.

1732
01:37:00,006 --> 01:37:01,290
Please! Please!

1733
01:37:01,636 --> 01:37:04,425
Listen, I really tried
to get him out of trouble.

1734
01:37:04,522 --> 01:37:06,729
They've got too much evidence.

1735
01:37:06,824 --> 01:37:08,493
Come on. I can't.

1736
01:37:08,810 --> 01:37:09,863
Please, please, please,
I'm begging you.

1737
01:37:09,959 --> 01:37:10,822
I can't.

1738
01:37:10,918 --> 01:37:13,767
- I beg you. I beg you.
- Amira, please.

1739
01:37:13,863 --> 01:37:15,656
I beg you!
I beg you!

1740
01:37:15,752 --> 01:37:17,499
Please, please help.

1741
01:37:17,604 --> 01:37:19,347
I can't. I can't.

1742
01:38:22,882 --> 01:38:25,921
I was determined
not to blame you.

1743
01:38:26,017 --> 01:38:28,645
And I know it wasn't your fault,
I know it wasn't this afternoon.

1744
01:38:28,742 --> 01:38:31,944
I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, I'm sorry.

1745
01:38:32,424 --> 01:38:36,165
No, it's me
who should be saying sorry.

1746
01:38:42,464 --> 01:38:45,132
I've been looking for love...

1747
01:38:46,436 --> 01:38:47,490
out there.

1748
01:38:50,663 --> 01:38:53,637
I thought I might have found it.

1749
01:38:57,252 --> 01:38:58,383
And did you?

1750
01:39:00,167 --> 01:39:04,597
I think I might have lost
the love I did have.

1751
01:39:04,894 --> 01:39:06,794
The love of my life.

1752
01:39:11,877 --> 01:39:12,931
Did I?

1753
01:39:20,095 --> 01:39:21,859
Liv, I need to tell you
everything.

1754
01:39:21,955 --> 01:39:25,312
I need to tell you
what I've done.

1755
01:40:03,681 --> 01:40:05,570
I thought you were going.

1756
01:40:05,667 --> 01:40:06,798
I can't go.

1757
01:40:09,694 --> 01:40:11,286
I slept with her.

1758
01:40:12,446 --> 01:40:15,036
It was hard enough
to tell you that last night.

1759
01:40:15,132 --> 01:40:17,826
That was bad enough
without saying it in public,

1760
01:40:17,921 --> 01:40:20,203
without hurting you twice.

1761
01:40:25,278 --> 01:40:29,938
When you hurt this much,
you can't be hurt twice.

1762
01:40:30,523 --> 01:40:32,652
I was looking at you...

1763
01:40:34,235 --> 01:40:39,203
and I was thinking how long
since I'd looked at you.

1764
01:40:39,778 --> 01:40:43,211
I don't even know how
to be honest.

1765
01:40:43,327 --> 01:40:45,657
Maybe that's why
I like metaphors.

1766
01:40:45,763 --> 01:40:50,423
Because what I want to say
is there's a circle...

1767
01:40:50,585 --> 01:40:54,250
yours and Bea's...
and I'm not in it.

1768
01:40:57,433 --> 01:41:01,662
But that's just to justify it,
because there's a part of me

1769
01:41:01,758 --> 01:41:05,653
so dark,
that sees that circle as a cage.

1770
01:41:20,189 --> 01:41:21,245
Thanks.

1771
01:41:21,369 --> 01:41:22,425
Will.

1772
01:41:23,257 --> 01:41:24,389
You made it.

1773
01:41:34,651 --> 01:41:36,626
Come in and sit down.

1774
01:41:38,679 --> 01:41:40,347
I'm sorry, there, um...

1775
01:41:40,443 --> 01:41:42,265
th-this is, there's
been a big mistake.

1776
01:41:42,361 --> 01:41:43,897
- Mistake?
- Yeah, um...

1777
01:41:43,992 --> 01:41:46,390
Yeah. This boy is definitely
not the burglar.

1778
01:41:46,495 --> 01:41:49,113
I know him, and I know
his... I know his mother.

1779
01:41:49,209 --> 01:41:51,099
What do you mean
you know them?

1780
01:41:51,194 --> 01:41:53,621
They came to our office.
They came to the office.

1781
01:41:53,726 --> 01:41:54,743
Well, how can that be?

1782
01:41:54,839 --> 01:41:55,797
You were told their names,

1783
01:41:55,892 --> 01:41:56,919
yet you never said
you recognized them.

1784
01:41:57,015 --> 01:41:59,220
I don't remember you
saying the name "Simic."

1785
01:41:59,325 --> 01:42:00,727
You definitely
didn't say "Simic."

1786
01:42:00,823 --> 01:42:01,820
Miro and I know each other.

1787
01:42:01,916 --> 01:42:03,660
Actually, very well.

1788
01:42:04,284 --> 01:42:05,242
Um, Miro is,

1789
01:42:05,339 --> 01:42:07,381
um, interested in architecture.

1790
01:42:07,478 --> 01:42:08,532
Mrs. Simic?

1791
01:42:09,213 --> 01:42:10,269
He is, yes.

1792
01:42:10,461 --> 01:42:12,531
No, I'm asking is it true
that you and Mr...

1793
01:42:12,637 --> 01:42:13,692
Um, Francis.

1794
01:42:14,459 --> 01:42:16,818
Francis... know each other?

1795
01:42:18,813 --> 01:42:22,677
Mr. Francis is, um,
I've done some work for him,

1796
01:42:22,774 --> 01:42:24,154
adjusting his suit.

1797
01:42:24,251 --> 01:42:26,676
I think this Mrs... Mrs., um,

1798
01:42:26,773 --> 01:42:29,130
Amira is being... discreet.

1799
01:42:31,576 --> 01:42:34,013
What do you mean, discreet?

1800
01:42:36,151 --> 01:42:41,656
Amira is being discreet about
the nature of our relationship,

1801
01:42:41,818 --> 01:42:44,849
which was not
an appropriate one,

1802
01:42:44,954 --> 01:42:47,793
and I think she's trying to
save me from embarrassment,

1803
01:42:47,899 --> 01:42:51,515
from the embarrassment
of myself and my family.

1804
01:42:51,611 --> 01:42:55,802
And that's why she, um,
that's why she's not saying

1805
01:42:55,897 --> 01:42:57,978
sh-she came to the office
with Miro.

1806
01:42:58,074 --> 01:43:02,034
I remember it, though; it was
the day of the last burglary.

1807
01:43:02,130 --> 01:43:03,089
And Miro cut his hand,

1808
01:43:03,185 --> 01:43:05,142
and that's obviously
where the, uh,

1809
01:43:05,238 --> 01:43:09,438
well, that's where the
DNA confusion occurred.

1810
01:43:10,867 --> 01:43:11,922
Mr. Hoffman?

1811
01:43:12,564 --> 01:43:14,386
Mr. Hoffman, do you know
anything about this?

1812
01:43:14,482 --> 01:43:16,994
No. No, I can't say I do.

1813
01:43:17,398 --> 01:43:18,452
Is this some sort of...

1814
01:43:18,548 --> 01:43:20,534
I mean, are we supposed
to believe this?

1815
01:43:20,629 --> 01:43:23,889
Actually, I've met
both of them at the office.

1816
01:43:23,986 --> 01:43:25,040
Yes.

1817
01:43:26,613 --> 01:43:30,392
And I-I dressed
the boy's cut, didn't I?

1818
01:43:30,488 --> 01:43:31,543
Yeah.

1819
01:43:32,856 --> 01:43:35,023
Wai... hang on a minute.

1820
01:43:35,119 --> 01:43:37,075
We recalled a computer,
which you claimed

1821
01:43:37,171 --> 01:43:38,611
had been stolen.

1822
01:43:40,404 --> 01:43:41,534
Yeah, I lent

1823
01:43:41,717 --> 01:43:43,635
I lent Mrs. Simic my laptop

1824
01:43:43,730 --> 01:43:46,416
sometime when we
were, um, together.

1825
01:43:46,512 --> 01:43:48,411
She takes photographs,

1826
01:43:48,690 --> 01:43:50,482
and I was showing her
how to store them,

1827
01:43:50,578 --> 01:43:54,856
um, what to do with them,
how to delete them.

1828
01:43:56,208 --> 01:43:59,719
I'd completely
forgotten; I was, um...

1829
01:44:01,330 --> 01:44:02,691
I was confused.

1830
01:44:06,517 --> 01:44:07,572
I'm sorry.

1831
01:44:11,763 --> 01:44:12,895
Really sorry.

1832
01:45:22,642 --> 01:45:24,848
What you did back there,

1833
01:45:25,260 --> 01:45:28,310
you gave that boy back
his life.

1834
01:45:36,364 --> 01:45:37,574
Stop the car.

1835
01:45:39,050 --> 01:45:40,105
What?

1836
01:45:40,306 --> 01:45:41,198
Liv, what are you doing?

1837
01:45:41,295 --> 01:45:43,375
You just don't get it,
do you?

1838
01:45:43,472 --> 01:45:44,525
- What?
- Oh, God.

1839
01:45:44,621 --> 01:45:46,222
We just go home, right?

1840
01:45:46,319 --> 01:45:47,883
We just go home, nothing
happened, nothing happened.

1841
01:45:47,978 --> 01:45:49,033
Liv?

1842
01:45:49,225 --> 01:45:51,181
- Go, go to Bosnia, go!
- I can't hear you.

1843
01:45:51,278 --> 01:45:53,128
Get back in the car, Liv.

1844
01:45:53,233 --> 01:45:54,365
Just go, go.

1845
01:45:56,235 --> 01:45:57,808
Why were you looking for love?

1846
01:45:57,903 --> 01:45:59,496
Ask yourself. Why?

1847
01:45:59,755 --> 01:46:02,286
Why weren't you looking for me?

1848
01:46:02,381 --> 01:46:03,532
Liv, get back in the car.

1849
01:46:03,628 --> 01:46:06,669
No. I don't want you
in the house!

1850
01:46:06,765 --> 01:46:08,366
I don't want you in the house!

1851
01:46:08,462 --> 01:46:09,516
God!

1852
01:46:10,122 --> 01:46:12,174
God, you drive me out.

1853
01:46:12,366 --> 01:46:13,584
You marry me then!

1854
01:46:13,680 --> 01:46:14,889
No, I don't want a husband!

1855
01:46:14,984 --> 01:46:16,039
I want a good night's sleep.

1856
01:46:16,145 --> 01:46:17,352
No. Marry me.

1857
01:46:17,610 --> 01:46:18,569
- No.
- Marry me.

1858
01:46:18,666 --> 01:46:19,663
- I'm sorry.
- No!

1859
01:46:19,759 --> 01:46:20,747
I want you back.

1860
01:46:20,844 --> 01:46:22,310
- Then win me back.
- How?

1861
01:46:22,417 --> 01:46:23,337
I don't know.

1862
01:46:23,433 --> 01:46:24,526
How? What will I do?
What do I do?

1863
01:46:24,621 --> 01:46:27,307
- I don't know!
- I've been such an idiot.

1864
01:46:27,402 --> 01:46:28,773
Just tell me what I have to do.

1865
01:46:28,879 --> 01:46:30,164
I don't know!

1866
01:46:30,701 --> 01:46:32,295
Look, I love you.

1867
01:46:32,592 --> 01:46:33,645
I love you.

1868
01:46:36,589 --> 01:46:38,469
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

1869
01:46:38,575 --> 01:46:39,860
I'm so sorry.

1870
01:47:04,525 --> 01:47:05,580
Mirsad.

1871
01:47:07,085 --> 01:47:08,523
We never met, did we;
I'm Will.

1872
01:47:08,619 --> 01:47:09,675
Hi.

1873
01:47:10,087 --> 01:47:11,469
So you're off to Sarajevo?

1874
01:47:11,564 --> 01:47:13,032
You wanted to say something,
right?

1875
01:47:13,128 --> 01:47:15,180
I just wanted to say
that I'm sorry.

1876
01:47:15,276 --> 01:47:16,292
- And...
- Wait.

1877
01:47:16,398 --> 01:47:19,140
Sandy, have you got
a minute?

1878
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:30,121
I just wanted to say
that I was sorry

1879
01:47:30,216 --> 01:47:31,818
and thanks for what you did.

1880
01:47:31,913 --> 01:47:34,734
You've given me another chance.

1881
01:47:35,750 --> 01:47:37,861
Okay, thanks for coming in.

1882
01:47:37,955 --> 01:47:39,010
Thank you.

1883
01:47:40,199 --> 01:47:44,937
This, I think, is the stuff
my mom mended for you.

1884
01:47:46,825 --> 01:47:47,881
Tell her...

1885
01:47:49,349 --> 01:47:53,165
tell her thanks
for mending stuff for me.

1886
01:47:56,741 --> 01:48:01,173
I thought maybe your
mother would come with you.

1887
01:48:01,576 --> 01:48:04,356
Yeah, she was going to,
but she's packing.

1888
01:48:04,451 --> 01:48:05,507
Is she?

1889
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:08,134
Thank you.

1890
01:48:47,300 --> 01:48:48,508
What is this?

1891
01:48:51,142 --> 01:49:00,022
THE END
