<i>[Episode 15]</i>

3
00:00:20,231 --> 00:00:22,231
If I like you too...

4
00:00:23,571 --> 00:00:25,483
Will you still think love is absurd?

5
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:32,550
You didn't know?

6
00:00:32,551 --> 00:00:34,280
Have you no sense at all?

7
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,449
I like you.

8
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,078
You like me too.

9
00:00:39,003 --> 00:00:40,871
Hey!

10
00:00:41,965 --> 00:00:44,188
There's no need to be so surprised.

11
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:50,838
Water... you need water.
Hold on a minute.

12
00:00:52,701 --> 00:00:55,200
Yang Dong Chul! Get water!

13
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:56,283
Okay!

14
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:00,591
Thanks.

15
00:01:07,572 --> 00:01:09,993
Ra Yoon Young... Oh, hey!

16
00:01:31,668 --> 00:01:33,337
<i>If I like you too...</i>

17
00:01:34,496 --> 00:01:36,435
<i>Will you still think love is absurd?</i>

18
00:01:36,436 --> 00:01:39,177
<i>If you like me, you should like me.
Why are you avoiding me?</i>

19
00:01:40,417 --> 00:01:41,817
Did it stop?

20
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:45,618
Did it?

21
00:01:49,123 --> 00:01:50,316
Yeah.

22
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:56,676
Why did you say such nonsense
and make me get hiccups?

23
00:01:56,677 --> 00:01:57,787
What?

24
00:01:59,126 --> 00:02:03,161
Did you know that I got divorced?

25
00:02:03,162 --> 00:02:05,715
Did you hear from Yoon Young?

26
00:02:05,716 --> 00:02:08,111
Why does it matter who I heard from?

27
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:13,134
You knew everything, and you were
just watching over me?

28
00:02:13,135 --> 00:02:15,482
You sure know how to embarrass a person.

29
00:02:15,483 --> 00:02:18,633
I knew you'd need time to put things
in order after the divorce, so I waited.

30
00:02:18,634 --> 00:02:20,423
Where are you trying to run off to?

31
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,912
You're saying you like me?

32
00:02:23,913 --> 00:02:27,547
That alone is funny.
But you think I like you too?

33
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:29,202
Who says so?

34
00:02:29,203 --> 00:02:30,333
Ha No Ra...

35
00:02:30,334 --> 00:02:32,509
I don't.

36
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,711
- You don't?
- I don't!

37
00:02:37,056 --> 00:02:41,960
Don't back away because of cliches
like your divorce and your son.

38
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:43,614
It wouldn't be like you, Ha No Ra.

39
00:02:45,156 --> 00:02:47,458
Whether it's a cliche or not

40
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,128
the fact that you think
I'm backing off is a cliche.

41
00:02:56,965 --> 00:02:59,722
I told you that I don't like you,
didn't I?

42
00:02:59,723 --> 00:03:01,396
Do you think everyone is into you?

43
00:03:01,397 --> 00:03:03,634
This is just too much,
I can't stay here any longer.

44
00:03:03,635 --> 00:03:04,848
I'm going now.

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,833
This is nonsense, total nonsense!

46
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,846
Cha Hyun Suk must be crazy.

47
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:37,103
Oh, Yoon Young.

48
00:03:37,104 --> 00:03:41,377
<i>I hear you and Cha Hyun Suk just
played out a scene from a romance movie.</i>

49
00:03:42,058 --> 00:03:44,985
Yoon Young, how did you know?

50
00:03:44,986 --> 00:03:47,758
<i>I'm already in my car.</i>

51
00:03:49,225 --> 00:03:51,369
I'm more amazed by you than Cha Hyun Suk.

52
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,569
How long has it been for you?

53
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:56,114
Since when did you have Cha Hyun Suk
in your heart, Miss Ha No Ra?

54
00:03:56,808 --> 00:03:58,632
It's not like that.

55
00:03:58,633 --> 00:04:01,120
What do you mean?
Dong Chul heard everything.

56
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:04,985
He told me the exact lines
of the romance scene.

57
00:04:04,986 --> 00:04:08,470
"If you like me, you should like me.
Why are you avoiding me?"

58
00:04:08,471 --> 00:04:09,490
Hey...

59
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:12,836
Must you lie to me?
I'm so happy about it.

60
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:14,785
You're happy about it?

61
00:04:14,786 --> 00:04:17,234
Of course.
Ha No Ra, you're a human being now.

62
00:04:17,235 --> 00:04:20,573
A bear ate mugwort and garlic and became
human in a hundred days. (Korean folklore)

63
00:04:20,574 --> 00:04:24,136
You now know how it feels to
like a person for the first time.

64
00:04:24,927 --> 00:04:28,276
That's the one good thing about this.

65
00:04:29,675 --> 00:04:32,091
Just being able to feel these feelings...

66
00:04:32,461 --> 00:04:37,100
Excitement, heart-pounding, and
always thinking about that person.

67
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,669
I realized that this is how it feels
to like a person.

68
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:44,830
That's right! So enjoy those feelings.

69
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:46,388
Cha Hyun Suk is completely right.

70
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:48,579
Why are you denying it and running away?

71
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,799
What could I do with him
that I would enjoy it?

72
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,900
A single woman and man like each other.
What's the issue?

73
00:04:54,901 --> 00:04:58,481
Am I in a position to feel that way
and play around?

74
00:04:58,482 --> 00:05:00,869
I have so much to think about.

75
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,991
What should I do after I graduate?

76
00:05:02,992 --> 00:05:06,028
I have to find a new place to live,
and work all my part-time jobs.

77
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:10,651
Even the Bluebird Theater job...
Hyun Suk set that up for me.

78
00:05:11,141 --> 00:05:15,679
He has some sort of need
to save and protect me.

79
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,932
This isn't some sort of...
self-condemnation, is it?

80
00:05:18,892 --> 00:05:22,264
No, just accepting reality.

81
00:05:54,906 --> 00:05:56,607
- Have a nice day.
- Okay.

82
00:06:04,247 --> 00:06:06,960
<i>I'm out front.
Bring your bag and come out.</i>

83
00:06:06,961 --> 00:06:08,307
Out front?

84
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,139
What's with him?

85
00:06:20,817 --> 00:06:22,295
Hey, friend.

86
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,504
What is it?

87
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:33,606
Friend, I guess you couldn't sleep either.

88
00:06:33,607 --> 00:06:34,997
Your eyes are red.

89
00:06:37,127 --> 00:06:39,486
What was on your mind all night?

90
00:06:39,487 --> 00:06:41,519
Actually, I slept very well.

91
00:06:42,336 --> 00:06:45,905
I couldn't sleep last night
because my mind was racing.

92
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,333
I just can't accept what you said.

93
00:06:48,334 --> 00:06:50,321
What can't you accept?

94
00:06:50,322 --> 00:06:52,439
That you don't like me.

95
00:06:54,221 --> 00:06:57,458
Why does that seem like a lie to me?

96
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:59,530
It's not a lie!

97
00:06:59,531 --> 00:07:01,881
Why don't you believe what people say?

98
00:07:01,882 --> 00:07:03,908
I said it, didn't I?

99
00:07:05,728 --> 00:07:09,299
So, I'm just a friend to you?

100
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,854
Yes, I consider you a very good friend.

101
00:07:13,855 --> 00:07:17,249
An old friend that I'm very grateful to.

102
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,088
Then show me proof that you
consider me just a friend.

103
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:22,018
You want proof?

104
00:07:22,019 --> 00:07:25,299
I couldn't forget you for 20 years.

105
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,803
You have to prove to me that you consider
me just a friend so I can let you go.

106
00:07:30,153 --> 00:07:33,923
Isn't that the very least you ought to do?
As a friend?

107
00:07:35,733 --> 00:07:37,744
Am I right or not?

108
00:07:39,213 --> 00:07:43,753
Think about what I did for you
and your grandma.

109
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:46,724
How am I supposed to help?

110
00:07:46,725 --> 00:07:51,215
I'm going to do all the things
I've always wanted to do with you.

111
00:07:51,216 --> 00:07:55,557
While we do, you'll have to prove to me
that you don't like me.

112
00:07:57,822 --> 00:07:59,156
Are you not up to the task?

113
00:07:59,158 --> 00:08:01,368
Then you should admit it now.

114
00:08:01,369 --> 00:08:05,757
No, I'm up for it! What should I do?

115
00:08:23,788 --> 00:08:25,724
Hey, come next to me.

116
00:08:25,725 --> 00:08:28,953
Why are we walking separately?
What kind of friends do that?

117
00:08:28,954 --> 00:08:30,834
The path is narrow. That's why.

118
00:08:36,164 --> 00:08:37,500
Oh my!

119
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:46,857
This isn't a bike path, you know!

120
00:08:54,678 --> 00:08:55,888
Here.

121
00:09:10,975 --> 00:09:13,263
What is it? Is it difficult to eat?

122
00:09:13,264 --> 00:09:14,537
Should I show you how?

123
00:09:14,538 --> 00:09:16,648
I can do it on my own.

124
00:09:16,649 --> 00:09:18,109
You can do it like this.

125
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:23,378
Eat it like this.

126
00:09:25,077 --> 00:09:27,226
I'll do it on my own.

127
00:09:55,288 --> 00:09:56,313
Eat.

128
00:10:05,373 --> 00:10:07,521
Thanks for breakfast.

129
00:10:07,522 --> 00:10:08,542
Wait.

130
00:10:13,292 --> 00:10:14,662
You're overreacting.

131
00:10:15,052 --> 00:10:16,764
I was going to undo the seat belt.

132
00:10:18,125 --> 00:10:19,955
I can do it myself.

133
00:10:23,905 --> 00:10:26,316
Do you think I'm doing it for you
because I think you can't?

134
00:10:28,144 --> 00:10:29,890
Then hurry up and undo it.

135
00:10:50,062 --> 00:10:53,629
A loan for school expenses
is possible for all four years?

136
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,550
Yes, as long as you apply
for student loans.

137
00:10:56,551 --> 00:11:01,418
However, you have to take 12 credits
every semester and maintain a C average.

138
00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:03,398
A C average?

139
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:08,114
I wish English could be an enjoyable
course for you like Satoori.

140
00:11:08,115 --> 00:11:11,410
But in Korea TOEIC is very important.

141
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:17,399
<i>A. The books have been arranged in piles.</i>

142
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,125
<i>B. The bookshelves have fallen over.</i>

143
00:11:21,126 --> 00:11:25,048
<i>C. The cart has been turned on its side.</i>

144
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:29,230
<i>D. The files have been stacked on
the bookshelf.</i>

145
00:11:29,548 --> 00:11:33,618
<i>B. Matt is holding some reading material.</i>

146
00:11:33,619 --> 00:11:37,918
<i>C. The shopper is picking out clothes
from the rack.</i>

147
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:42,379
<i>D. The man is folding the merchandise
on the table.</i>

148
00:11:50,111 --> 00:11:51,466
Ha No Ra.

149
00:11:52,023 --> 00:11:53,278
You startled me.

150
00:11:54,578 --> 00:11:56,903
Seriously, Cha Hyun Suk!

151
00:11:57,714 --> 00:12:00,536
I waited a long time,
but you came out last.

152
00:12:00,537 --> 00:12:03,427
You think holding onto the test longer
will improve your chances?

153
00:12:04,407 --> 00:12:07,023
What now? What, what?

154
00:12:07,024 --> 00:12:08,990
You want me to prove something again?

155
00:12:08,991 --> 00:12:10,840
- You think everyone is into you?
- What?

156
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:14,878
Look at you... you must think
I'm thinking about you all day long.

157
00:12:15,427 --> 00:12:17,591
Then why are you here?

158
00:12:17,592 --> 00:12:19,601
I came here because of work.

159
00:12:19,602 --> 00:12:22,991
I'm going to a site today,
and I need my assistant.

160
00:12:24,572 --> 00:12:26,830
I didn't think you were thinking of
using our theater.

161
00:12:26,831 --> 00:12:29,764
I thought you'd use a big theater,
Producer Cha.

162
00:12:29,765 --> 00:12:32,224
It's for a show that will have
a very limited audience.

163
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:35,436
What do you think about the atmosphere
of this theater?

164
00:12:35,437 --> 00:12:38,235
The audience will mostly be people
that sent in their stories

165
00:12:38,236 --> 00:12:39,635
so I think it's good.

166
00:12:39,636 --> 00:12:42,615
I think the acting will be relayed
well to them, as well.

167
00:12:42,616 --> 00:12:43,787
Bingo.

168
00:12:44,616 --> 00:12:47,064
Who is she again?

169
00:12:47,065 --> 00:12:48,894
She's the woman that I like.

170
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:51,985
- Really?
- Yes.

171
00:12:52,446 --> 00:12:55,885
But she says she doesn't like me much.

172
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:19,178
Oh! I came here with Danny.

173
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:21,079
How did you know it?

174
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,476
Telepathy?

175
00:13:23,682 --> 00:13:27,945
I suppose I told you about all sorts
of things, didn't I?

176
00:13:27,946 --> 00:13:31,286
Why are you copying Danny?

177
00:13:31,287 --> 00:13:33,903
All date spots are basically the same.

178
00:13:33,904 --> 00:13:36,816
But I did bring something different.

179
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:38,086
What?

180
00:13:40,437 --> 00:13:42,737
Let's lie down and read comic books.

181
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:47,051
Romance, action, comedy...
which one do you want?

182
00:13:48,457 --> 00:13:51,010
Lie down here and read comic books?

183
00:13:51,011 --> 00:13:54,921
You said we were friends.
Why? You don't think you can?

184
00:13:55,664 --> 00:13:59,683
Who says I can't? Let's do it. Do it.

185
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:40,685
What is it? Is it funny?

186
00:14:40,686 --> 00:14:43,149
Huh? Yeah.

187
00:14:43,888 --> 00:14:45,369
Let's read it together.

188
00:14:48,274 --> 00:14:50,307
Move over.

189
00:14:56,734 --> 00:14:59,824
You read this then.
I'll read a different one.

190
00:14:59,825 --> 00:15:03,134
Turn the page.
Don't mind me, just keep reading.

191
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,649
Oh, my arm hurts.

192
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,600
Be a pillow for me, okay?

193
00:15:33,288 --> 00:15:36,230
Why leave your car and take the subway?

194
00:15:36,231 --> 00:15:38,330
We've never done this before either.

195
00:15:38,683 --> 00:15:40,174
We should do it before it's too late.

196
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,483
It's not time to get off yet...

197
00:16:05,484 --> 00:16:08,625
You sit here. I'm doing what I want to do.

198
00:16:26,684 --> 00:16:29,414
<i>You have to prove to me
that you consider me just a friend.</i>

199
00:17:09,409 --> 00:17:11,178
You were really tired, right?

200
00:17:11,487 --> 00:17:13,816
You were anxious and tense.

201
00:17:13,817 --> 00:17:16,777
Only because we were out all day long.

202
00:17:18,146 --> 00:17:19,739
Mom?

203
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,319
Oh, Min Soo!

204
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,603
Who...

205
00:17:24,604 --> 00:17:27,553
Oh, that couple from before...

206
00:17:27,554 --> 00:17:30,040
You know Hye Mi and my Min Soo?

207
00:17:31,411 --> 00:17:33,694
So you were No Ra's son.

208
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,231
Nice to meet you. My name is Cha Hyun Suk.

209
00:17:37,232 --> 00:17:40,718
He's my classmate from high school.

210
00:17:40,719 --> 00:17:44,143
Nice to meet you. My name is Kim Min Soo.

211
00:17:44,144 --> 00:17:47,755
I'm working at his office right now.

212
00:17:48,494 --> 00:17:51,654
Did you not make up with your girlfriend?
What's with the beer?

213
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:54,101
No, I was going to drink it with my mom.

214
00:17:58,278 --> 00:18:00,028
Have a nice night.

215
00:18:00,029 --> 00:18:01,540
See you again next time.

216
00:18:07,147 --> 00:18:08,230
Let's go.

217
00:18:20,334 --> 00:18:23,479
This is the first time I've had drinks
with my son.

218
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,659
What's going on that you wanted
to drink beer?

219
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,518
My mind is so complicated lately.

220
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:33,239
I don't remember why I decided to work
for a large corporation.

221
00:18:34,596 --> 00:18:38,475
What do I want to do,
and how do I want to live?

222
00:18:38,476 --> 00:18:41,005
I've never even thought about it.

223
00:18:41,006 --> 00:18:43,313
Because you were so busy studying.

224
00:18:43,314 --> 00:18:45,044
Just like Dad told me to.

225
00:18:49,855 --> 00:18:55,764
Once I graduate and get a job,
I have trouble picturing my life.

226
00:18:55,765 --> 00:18:58,553
You can start thinking about that now.

227
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,667
Don't be too impatient.

228
00:19:12,517 --> 00:19:16,310
<i>What do I want to do,
and how do I want to live?</i>

229
00:19:16,311 --> 00:19:18,229
<i>I've never even thought about it.</i>

230
00:19:29,709 --> 00:19:30,841
<i>I'm out front.</i>

231
00:19:30,842 --> 00:19:32,553
<i>I'll be waiting, so come out.</i>

232
00:19:32,554 --> 00:19:33,669
Again?

233
00:19:35,481 --> 00:19:40,467
I don't want to prove my feelings
to you anymore.

234
00:19:40,907 --> 00:19:43,336
I don't know why I have to.

235
00:19:43,337 --> 00:19:45,267
Then are you admitting that you like me?

236
00:19:45,268 --> 00:19:48,086
No! No! No, no!

237
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:53,957
I'm saying I don't want to spend time
with you having to prove that I don't.

238
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:55,058
Why?

239
00:19:55,913 --> 00:19:58,188
- Because I don't...
- like you?

240
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:02,236
When you eat your toast,
you're afraid to get ketchup on your face.

241
00:20:02,237 --> 00:20:03,797
When you jumped out of the way of the bike

242
00:20:03,798 --> 00:20:05,356
and when I undid your seat belt,
you were nervous.

243
00:20:05,357 --> 00:20:09,917
When I'm near you you can't breathe,
and you can't even look me in the eye.

244
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,956
Is that how you act towards a friend?

245
00:20:13,957 --> 00:20:18,718
Even if we are friends,
you're still a man and it is awkward.

246
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:21,467
Do you know how you treated me
in high school?

247
00:20:21,468 --> 00:20:26,295
When we worked on our dance routine
and it went well, you'd hug me.

248
00:20:26,296 --> 00:20:30,725
You'd always put me in a headlock
and tease me.

249
00:20:30,726 --> 00:20:33,674
You truly treated me like a friend then.

250
00:20:33,675 --> 00:20:38,316
Now, you care about eating in front of me
and my touch.

251
00:20:38,317 --> 00:20:39,575
You can't lie down and relax.

252
00:20:39,576 --> 00:20:43,155
That's because you said you like me.

253
00:20:43,156 --> 00:20:44,807
It's become uncomfortable.

254
00:20:44,808 --> 00:20:48,107
That's right! I like you... a lot.

255
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:52,326
Hey! Please stop saying things like that.

256
00:20:52,327 --> 00:20:53,988
It's been 20 years.

257
00:20:53,989 --> 00:20:57,476
It took 20 years for me to have an
opportunity to say I like you.

258
00:20:57,477 --> 00:20:59,027
Why are you telling me not to say it?

259
00:20:59,028 --> 00:21:00,667
Because it has been 20 years.

260
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:07,217
You... your eyes are stuck back in
the past, 20 years ago.

261
00:21:07,218 --> 00:21:10,386
That's why you still see me as that pretty
and precious person.

262
00:21:10,387 --> 00:21:12,597
I am really thankful for that.

263
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:16,104
But, you need to stop that.

264
00:21:16,105 --> 00:21:18,033
Am I asking you to marry me or something?

265
00:21:18,034 --> 00:21:22,759
We can eat together, have coffee, fight,
get mad, and make up.

266
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,580
I just want to spend time together.

267
00:21:24,582 --> 00:21:27,790
We can do that as friends.

268
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:30,903
- So, even as friends...
- I can't be friends anymore.

269
00:21:30,904 --> 00:21:33,897
We're a man and woman who like each other.
Why would we be friends?

270
00:21:33,898 --> 00:21:37,717
Stop saying we like each other.
I told you that I don't.

271
00:21:37,718 --> 00:21:40,938
I just don't like
getting stuff on my mouth.

272
00:21:40,939 --> 00:21:45,348
If I can do it on my own like seat belts,
I don't like others doing it for me.

273
00:21:45,349 --> 00:21:49,778
I especially don't like it
when people touch my waist!

274
00:21:50,387 --> 00:21:52,710
- Ha No Ra...
- Most importantly...

275
00:21:53,952 --> 00:21:55,951
you are not my type.

276
00:21:56,682 --> 00:22:03,352
I like men with big faces,
thick double eyelids, and no dimples.

277
00:22:05,251 --> 00:22:08,802
So... give it a rest now.

278
00:22:08,803 --> 00:22:11,191
Ha No Ra, you are a good liar.

279
00:22:11,192 --> 00:22:13,412
It's not a lie.

280
00:22:13,413 --> 00:22:16,402
I would like it if you no longer
made things uncomfortable.

281
00:22:18,561 --> 00:22:20,624
All right.

282
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:24,012
All you want is for me to leave you alone?

283
00:22:24,013 --> 00:22:25,104
Yes.

284
00:22:25,673 --> 00:22:28,101
Then that's what I'll do,
and I'm going now.

285
00:22:28,102 --> 00:22:29,409
Yes!

286
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:31,438
I'm really going.

287
00:22:31,439 --> 00:22:32,921
I said go.

288
00:23:01,574 --> 00:23:02,799
Hye Mi.

289
00:23:08,615 --> 00:23:10,835
Let's skip class
and go have fun somewhere.

290
00:23:10,836 --> 00:23:12,004
What?

291
00:23:12,005 --> 00:23:13,965
You wanted to go on a trip with me,
didn't you?

292
00:23:14,404 --> 00:23:17,334
Kim Min Soo, why are you suddenly
acting like this?

293
00:23:17,335 --> 00:23:19,634
When I insisted on going,
you kept saying no.

294
00:23:19,635 --> 00:23:22,057
I suddenly wanted to go... with you.

295
00:23:23,067 --> 00:23:26,016
If you don't want to go...
I might just go on my own.

296
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,559
Let's go.

297
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,873
One, two, three!

298
00:23:54,857 --> 00:23:57,499
I won! You're buying the meal.

299
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,684
Hey, Oh Hye Mi.

300
00:23:59,644 --> 00:24:02,040
Why do you keep giving it to me?
You eat some too.

301
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:05,634
Come here.

302
00:24:10,542 --> 00:24:11,771
You're cold, right?

303
00:24:15,894 --> 00:24:19,214
This is the best date we've been on.

304
00:24:19,215 --> 00:24:21,445
This was what you've always talked about,
wasn't it?

305
00:24:21,776 --> 00:24:26,297
A date where Kim Min Soo is focused on
Oh Hye Mi one hundred percent.

306
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:30,496
But, I'm very sad too.

307
00:24:32,493 --> 00:24:36,523
Does this mean you don't think you'll be
able to do this for me in the future?

308
00:24:37,273 --> 00:24:40,753
Is that why we're doing everything
all at once?

309
00:24:41,244 --> 00:24:44,453
Yes, I can't do it yet.

310
00:24:44,454 --> 00:24:49,053
Yeah... that's what I thought.

311
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:51,989
I thought a lot about what you said.

312
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,131
Right now, I need time.

313
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:03,656
You are so sure of the life you want.

314
00:25:03,657 --> 00:25:04,991
I'm not that way.

315
00:25:04,992 --> 00:25:06,412
I only found that out now.

316
00:25:06,413 --> 00:25:10,140
So... I need some time for myself.

317
00:25:11,285 --> 00:25:13,512
It's not because I don't like you.

318
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:17,283
I need to know who I am,
and what I want to do in my life...

319
00:25:17,284 --> 00:25:20,132
I need time to found out who I am.

320
00:25:20,133 --> 00:25:23,594
Even if we continued to date,
we would have continued fighting.

321
00:25:24,634 --> 00:25:29,094
I still want to live my 20 year old
life with ease.

322
00:25:32,608 --> 00:25:34,657
I'm sorry I can't be with you.

323
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:41,672
I'm sorry that I couldn't try
to be more understanding.

324
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:43,154
You know what?

325
00:25:43,155 --> 00:25:46,660
Later on, you're really going
to regret today.

326
00:25:46,661 --> 00:25:50,270
You might cry every night
because you miss Oh Hye Mi.

327
00:25:50,271 --> 00:25:53,542
Yeah, I think I might.

328
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,211
I think I'll regret it.

329
00:25:57,009 --> 00:25:58,381
Me too.

330
00:25:59,566 --> 00:26:00,566
Let's...

331
00:26:00,567 --> 00:26:03,346
Let's do everything we want to do,
so that we regret it a little less.

332
00:26:03,876 --> 00:26:06,021
Is there anything else you want to do?

333
00:26:10,994 --> 00:26:12,909
One, two, three.

334
00:26:54,992 --> 00:26:58,555
I only divorced so that we could
start over again.

335
00:26:58,556 --> 00:26:59,812
Kim Woo Chul...

336
00:26:59,813 --> 00:27:03,913
Let's start a proper love triangle now.

337
00:27:06,182 --> 00:27:07,501
Did they break up?

338
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:14,255
Kim Yi Jin must be quite traumatized.

339
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:22,036
Oh my, Sang Ye!

340
00:27:22,711 --> 00:27:24,797
How do I look?

341
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:26,026
Is it strange?

342
00:27:26,027 --> 00:27:28,664
No, you look so pretty.

343
00:27:28,665 --> 00:27:31,483
I've never seen you
look so feminine before.

344
00:27:32,414 --> 00:27:33,877
I just brewed it.

345
00:27:33,878 --> 00:27:37,403
Thank you.
What's the occasion, by the way?

346
00:27:37,404 --> 00:27:39,614
Is today a special day?

347
00:27:39,615 --> 00:27:41,346
There is...

348
00:27:42,773 --> 00:27:44,625
Yes, it is.

349
00:27:46,423 --> 00:27:50,610
I remembered what I said to you
that day that I was drunk.

350
00:27:50,611 --> 00:27:51,646
What?

351
00:27:52,807 --> 00:27:56,192
Ah, you remembered?

352
00:27:57,031 --> 00:27:59,292
- Were you surprised?
- No.

353
00:28:00,614 --> 00:28:05,294
Well, I guess I was.
But you were very drunk that day.

354
00:28:06,156 --> 00:28:10,509
I found out why people say they find
their answers while they are drunk.

355
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:14,390
Since my feelings have been revealed,
I'm going to make a confession to Senior.

356
00:28:15,511 --> 00:28:16,918
A confession?

357
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:21,874
Since I'm dressed like this, do you think
he will finally see me as a woman?

358
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:25,031
Of course. You look so pretty.

359
00:28:25,032 --> 00:28:29,271
Once he gets here,
please give me some support.

360
00:28:29,272 --> 00:28:30,733
I will.

361
00:28:36,854 --> 00:28:40,573
Wow, who is this? Is that Shin Sang Ye?

362
00:28:41,953 --> 00:28:44,591
I thought it was someone else.

363
00:28:44,592 --> 00:28:46,357
I look odd, don't I?

364
00:28:46,358 --> 00:28:47,949
It reminds me of the past.

365
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:49,990
You dressed like that in college.

366
00:28:51,105 --> 00:28:55,085
Ah, I guess I ruined you
when you became my Assistant Producer.

367
00:28:55,086 --> 00:28:57,374
Senior has a good memory, right?

368
00:28:58,272 --> 00:29:00,212
He does.

369
00:29:00,213 --> 00:29:02,589
Sang Ye, I'll be in the office.

370
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:06,212
Can you tell Ha No Ra to bring the latest
version of the actors list?

371
00:29:06,213 --> 00:29:09,333
What? Why don't you tell her yourself?

372
00:29:09,334 --> 00:29:12,973
Also, tell Ha No Ra
that I'd like a cup of coffee.

373
00:29:28,144 --> 00:29:31,544
Yesterday, I slept over
at Ha No Ra's house.

374
00:29:32,557 --> 00:29:33,584
What?

375
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,614
She even made me pollack stew
in the morning.

376
00:29:36,615 --> 00:29:38,453
Hey, Shin Sang Ye...

377
00:29:38,454 --> 00:29:42,049
Eating that stew tasted like I was
getting over my last remaining feelings.

378
00:29:44,137 --> 00:29:47,818
I'm sorry you had to find out about
my feelings, Senior.

379
00:29:50,461 --> 00:29:51,593
All right...

380
00:29:52,733 --> 00:29:55,063
I'm not going to feel sorry towards you.

381
00:29:56,692 --> 00:29:57,827
But...

382
00:29:59,758 --> 00:30:01,308
I don't feel good about it.

383
00:30:02,948 --> 00:30:06,194
Then... set me up with someone.

384
00:30:34,376 --> 00:30:35,980
Professor Kim Woo Chul...

385
00:30:37,319 --> 00:30:39,662
Can he remain at Woocheon University?

386
00:31:42,298 --> 00:31:45,086
Oh, when did she come and go?

387
00:31:50,583 --> 00:31:52,075
Sang Ye, let's go now.

388
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,361
Okay.

389
00:31:55,794 --> 00:31:57,845
We need to head out.

390
00:31:59,118 --> 00:32:00,335
Sang Ye.

391
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:05,096
Tell No Ra she can go once she shreds
files and organizes the meeting notes.

392
00:32:06,586 --> 00:32:10,515
The two of you slip back in time to
18 years old whenever you meet.

393
00:32:10,516 --> 00:32:12,786
- Please do as he asked.
- I will.

394
00:32:13,214 --> 00:32:17,652
Tell Professor Cha Hyun Suk,
"I understand".

395
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,252
Let's get going, Senior.

396
00:32:39,414 --> 00:32:41,044
Shin Sang Ye, you're all grown up.

397
00:32:41,045 --> 00:32:43,505
Getting all dressed up for a blind date.

398
00:32:44,584 --> 00:32:46,883
Only because you're vouching for him.

399
00:32:46,884 --> 00:32:49,675
Also, I had another purpose.

400
00:32:50,628 --> 00:32:51,889
What do you mean?

401
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:56,108
Ha No Ra believes that I'm on my way
to confess my feelings to you right now.

402
00:32:56,719 --> 00:32:57,886
What?

403
00:32:57,887 --> 00:32:59,924
I wanted her to be jealous.

404
00:32:59,925 --> 00:33:01,477
I was just a little upset for you.

405
00:33:01,478 --> 00:33:04,586
Hey kid, why did you do
a useless thing like that?

406
00:33:04,587 --> 00:33:07,006
Right now, jealousy would have
a negative effect.

407
00:33:07,007 --> 00:33:10,450
Goodness, you just don't get women.

408
00:33:10,451 --> 00:33:13,329
It sure didn't seem useless to me.

409
00:33:14,546 --> 00:33:15,715
Yeah?

410
00:33:16,166 --> 00:33:17,166
Oh right.

411
00:33:17,167 --> 00:33:20,352
The department chair wants to know
your plans for next semester’s courses.

412
00:33:20,353 --> 00:33:21,756
What should I say?

413
00:33:21,757 --> 00:33:24,007
I'll take care of it.

414
00:33:30,252 --> 00:33:34,942
<i>Since my feelings have been revealed,
I'm going to make a confession to Senior.</i>

415
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:38,891
Pull yourself together. Come on.

416
00:33:39,271 --> 00:33:41,540
<i>I'm going to make a confession to Senior.</i>

417
00:33:41,541 --> 00:33:43,823
<i>Do you think he will finally
see me as a woman?</i>

418
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,048
<i>[Ra Yoon Young]</i>

419
00:33:53,557 --> 00:33:54,952
Oh, Yoon Young.

420
00:33:54,953 --> 00:33:56,358
<i>Where are you?</i>

421
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:58,922
<i>Let's go to see the Yeonam-dong store
right now.</i>

422
00:33:59,592 --> 00:34:01,078
Why?

423
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:04,100
<i>One of my students parents owns
a business consulting company.</i>

424
00:34:04,101 --> 00:34:06,230
<i>I want to take photos and show it to them.</i>

425
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,629
Business consulting?

426
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:11,877
Whether you go to school or not,
how long can you do part-time work for?

427
00:34:11,878 --> 00:34:13,837
They are trustworthy consultants.

428
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:15,829
We can just look into it.

429
00:34:17,751 --> 00:34:21,239
Oh... are you the new owners?

430
00:34:22,938 --> 00:34:23,955
Pardon?

431
00:34:23,956 --> 00:34:26,906
Even though there are new owners,
I still have time left on my contract.

432
00:34:26,907 --> 00:34:28,938
I can extend it automatically, can't I?

433
00:34:30,295 --> 00:34:32,425
What do you mean, new owners?

434
00:34:44,161 --> 00:34:46,195
<i>[Min Soo's Mom]</i>

435
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,672
Yes, Min Soo's Mom...

436
00:34:50,018 --> 00:34:54,549
By any chance, did you sell
the Yeonam-dong store?

437
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:57,888
What? How did you find out?

438
00:34:57,889 --> 00:35:00,179
I came here with Yoon Young.

439
00:35:01,179 --> 00:35:03,683
Oh that... don't misunderstand.

440
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:06,656
I didn't have a place to stay,
so I sold it in a rush.

441
00:35:06,657 --> 00:35:08,936
Ask him why he'd do that
without consulting you about it.

442
00:35:10,077 --> 00:35:12,546
You should have told me beforehand.

443
00:35:12,547 --> 00:35:16,207
With the final exams, I was so busy.
I made a mistake.

444
00:35:16,208 --> 00:35:20,800
In return, once our apartment get rented
you can keep the deposit money.

445
00:35:21,324 --> 00:35:24,796
We'll talk about that when it gets rented.

446
00:35:24,797 --> 00:35:26,867
I'll come by to talk about it.

447
00:35:27,817 --> 00:35:29,950
It looks like I'll be going
to Jahcheon University.

448
00:35:29,951 --> 00:35:33,187
You can attend school comfortably.

449
00:35:33,188 --> 00:35:34,717
All right.

450
00:35:36,023 --> 00:35:37,739
What is he saying?

451
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:40,180
The deposit money is larger,
and he's telling you to keep that.

452
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:42,140
And he sold off the store that he was
supposed to give you.

453
00:35:42,141 --> 00:35:44,839
Do you think he's up to something?

454
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,620
He wouldn't do that.

455
00:35:46,621 --> 00:35:48,242
We have Min Soo, after all.

456
00:35:59,802 --> 00:36:01,586
That's the last boat out.

457
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:13,222
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

458
00:36:20,884 --> 00:36:22,561
You must be going to class.

459
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,772
Oh, Sang Ye.

460
00:36:24,773 --> 00:36:27,317
You know that auditions start the day
after tomorrow, don't you?

461
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:31,167
When you get the script from the printers,
can you check it for any errors?

462
00:36:31,168 --> 00:36:32,639
I'll do that.

463
00:36:33,885 --> 00:36:36,840
Did you have fun yesterday?

464
00:36:37,771 --> 00:36:38,958
Yes.

465
00:36:40,023 --> 00:36:42,623
It was much better than I thought it'd be.

466
00:36:43,005 --> 00:36:46,276
Ah... that's good.

467
00:36:46,277 --> 00:36:48,559
I have a report to write.

468
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:56,507
Gosh, she's taking it too well.

469
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,235
That's not how it's supposed to go.

470
00:37:01,666 --> 00:37:03,231
<i>[Resignation]</i>

471
00:37:05,653 --> 00:37:07,522
<i>I'd like to see you.</i>

472
00:37:07,523 --> 00:37:09,327
<i>I have something to talk about.</i>

473
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:15,157
Who is it?

474
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:17,811
Hello.

475
00:37:17,813 --> 00:37:22,012
A man out in the hallway
asked me to give this to you.

476
00:37:24,268 --> 00:37:25,402
Okay, thank you.

477
00:37:39,565 --> 00:37:40,956
What is this?

478
00:37:43,505 --> 00:37:45,346
How did this photo get taken?

479
00:37:50,695 --> 00:37:52,876
<i>[Kyung Dae Nam]</i>

480
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,187
Yes?

481
00:37:56,188 --> 00:37:58,981
<i>Hey, Kim Woo Chul.
Is something going on with you?</i>

482
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:01,522
What do you mean by that?

483
00:38:01,523 --> 00:38:03,939
I just heard from Doctor Cha.

484
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:07,819
<i>Jahcheon University heard there's an issue
with you, and you'll be getting cut.</i>

485
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,789
What are you saying? Why would I?

486
00:38:10,952 --> 00:38:13,541
<i>Woocheon is planning to dismiss you soon.</i>

487
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,048
<i>You didn't know?</i>

488
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,480
Dismiss me?

489
00:38:22,742 --> 00:38:24,893
<i>This was a setup from the start.</i>

490
00:38:25,653 --> 00:38:27,823
<i>I fell into a trap.</i>

491
00:38:27,824 --> 00:38:29,635
<i>Dismissing me from Woocheon University...</i>

492
00:38:30,682 --> 00:38:32,507
<i>Who would do such a thing?</i>

493
00:38:35,518 --> 00:38:39,025
I even made you
a Woocheon University professor.

494
00:38:39,873 --> 00:38:41,273
Yi Jin?

495
00:38:50,568 --> 00:38:54,371
I wanted to ask you one thing.

496
00:38:55,005 --> 00:38:58,958
Just one thing?
You must be curious about many things.

497
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,789
I wasn't sure it was you...

498
00:39:02,929 --> 00:39:04,929
But Jahcheon is acting strange.

499
00:39:05,942 --> 00:39:07,821
Was this your doing too?

500
00:39:07,822 --> 00:39:08,922
Yes.

501
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,400
I did it.

502
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:15,362
How could you, Yi Jin?
How could you do such a thing?

503
00:39:17,193 --> 00:39:19,405
Someone so pure like you...

504
00:39:21,989 --> 00:39:26,104
This is the punishment
for someone who betrayed that purity.

505
00:39:26,105 --> 00:39:28,125
For the crime of making me
a laughingstock.

506
00:39:28,126 --> 00:39:31,933
And what about the money I paid them?
Did you take that too?

507
00:39:31,934 --> 00:39:33,413
Take the money?

508
00:39:33,414 --> 00:39:35,754
I have no interest in money.

509
00:39:35,755 --> 00:39:38,573
When you hit rock bottom,
you're going to need all that money.

510
00:39:38,574 --> 00:39:40,804
Then, why blackmail me for money?

511
00:39:42,844 --> 00:39:45,194
It was bait
in order to get this picture of you.

512
00:39:45,195 --> 00:39:46,510
Bait?

513
00:39:51,114 --> 00:39:55,723
Then did you orchestrate Choi Kyu Won's
bribery scandal, as well?

514
00:39:55,724 --> 00:39:58,144
According to some, you're the one
who orchestrated it.

515
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,154
Yi Jin, you made a mistake.

516
00:40:01,155 --> 00:40:03,355
I have a contract with that student's
fingerprint on it.

517
00:40:03,356 --> 00:40:05,174
If I report it, that student will be
caught right away.

518
00:40:05,175 --> 00:40:07,491
And once she is caught,
everything about you will be revealed.

519
00:40:07,492 --> 00:40:09,873
Take that contract and go to the police!

520
00:40:11,083 --> 00:40:16,288
That contract is evidence that you did
orchestrate the Choi Kyu Won scandal.

521
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:20,872
"I, Kim Woo Chul, ordered the girls
to take photos of Choi Kyu Won."

522
00:40:20,873 --> 00:40:22,370
"That is why I got blackmailed."

523
00:40:22,371 --> 00:40:25,579
"That is why I paid and told her
not to threaten me again."

524
00:40:28,632 --> 00:40:32,143
Once they find the student,
this matter will be over with.

525
00:40:33,414 --> 00:40:36,112
If you can find her, that is...

526
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:45,360
What was the purpose of taking this photo?

527
00:40:46,534 --> 00:40:51,514
As for that...
you'll find out tomorrow morning.

528
00:41:16,135 --> 00:41:18,192
Are you all right, Kim Woo Chul?

529
00:41:19,184 --> 00:41:20,824
Yes, hello.

530
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,706
What's with him?

531
00:41:40,592 --> 00:41:41,857
This is why people say

532
00:41:41,858 --> 00:41:44,641
no matter how quickly you regret,
it is still too late.

533
00:41:45,184 --> 00:41:46,826
Producer Cha!

534
00:41:46,827 --> 00:41:49,878
Oh my, who has upset you so much?

535
00:41:50,628 --> 00:41:54,446
Many people enter
without announcing themselves, like you.

536
00:41:54,447 --> 00:41:56,537
What brings you by?

537
00:41:56,538 --> 00:42:01,136
I wanted to let you know that I won't
be teaching at Woocheon next semester.

538
00:42:01,137 --> 00:42:04,177
Why are you telling me?

539
00:42:05,277 --> 00:42:08,259
You should tell your own department chair.

540
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:12,466
You were the one who first came to me
to become an adjunct professor.

541
00:42:12,467 --> 00:42:15,137
Ah, that's right. I did.

542
00:42:18,184 --> 00:42:21,822
Thank you for all your work.

543
00:42:23,034 --> 00:42:24,494
You're not going to stop me?

544
00:42:26,375 --> 00:42:29,296
Is it because you think you can't stop me?

545
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:32,463
Or is it because you don't want to?

546
00:42:34,474 --> 00:42:38,333
You do know that I'm not going to fall
for your tricky words again, right?

547
00:42:39,536 --> 00:42:40,985
Goodbye.

548
00:42:51,552 --> 00:42:55,548
"No matter how quickly you regret,
it is still too late"?

549
00:42:56,222 --> 00:42:58,942
Senior, look at this.

550
00:42:59,672 --> 00:43:00,792
What is it?

551
00:43:00,793 --> 00:43:06,341
There is a post on Space Host that a
Professor K got hired through connections.

552
00:43:06,342 --> 00:43:09,827
On the list on potential professors,
Kim Woo Chul is listed.

553
00:43:10,228 --> 00:43:11,484
Kim Woo Chul?

554
00:43:11,485 --> 00:43:12,804
Take a look.

555
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:24,837
<i>This is a picture taken
at Woocheon University.</i>

556
00:43:24,838 --> 00:43:31,279
<i>In the background, Professor Choi is seen
receiving a cake box from his student.</i>

557
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:36,989
<i>Netizens realized that there was no cake,
but crumpled newspapers in the box.</i>

558
00:43:37,867 --> 00:43:39,235
Sang Ye.

559
00:43:40,396 --> 00:43:43,049
When was
the Professor Choi Kyu Won scandal?

560
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:45,655
I think it was before first lecture.

561
00:43:47,795 --> 00:43:51,696
Can you find me the picture
of the students and some new videos?

562
00:43:51,697 --> 00:43:53,038
Okay.

563
00:43:59,601 --> 00:44:00,927
Yeah, Ra Yoon Young.

564
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:04,837
<i>Hey, Cha Hyun Suk.
I'm calling because something is off.</i>

565
00:44:04,838 --> 00:44:06,847
<i>Look into something for me.</i>

566
00:44:07,188 --> 00:44:08,429
What is it?

567
00:44:09,907 --> 00:44:13,307
He sold the store in a hurry?

568
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:16,348
<i>No Ra doesn't know that I called you.</i>

569
00:44:16,349 --> 00:44:19,108
<i>I just can't trust Kim Woo Chul.</i>

570
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,689
Thanks for coming right away.

571
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:29,229
Professor, what was so urgent?

572
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:32,009
Do a part-time job for me.

573
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:33,389
A job?

574
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:37,121
What kind of job?

575
00:44:38,152 --> 00:44:42,023
<i>You'll find out tomorrow morning.</i>

576
00:44:43,411 --> 00:44:44,864
Tomorrow morning...

577
00:44:46,806 --> 00:44:48,228
Tomorrow morning...

578
00:44:50,579 --> 00:44:52,079
Tomorrow morning, she said.

579
00:45:03,094 --> 00:45:04,672
What should I do?

580
00:45:05,626 --> 00:45:08,053
I told you I have somewhere I need to be.

581
00:45:08,054 --> 00:45:10,192
This isn't right.

582
00:45:10,193 --> 00:45:13,303
- Come back tomorrow...
- It will be too late tomorrow.

583
00:45:13,304 --> 00:45:16,154
Too late? What is it?

584
00:45:16,155 --> 00:45:18,824
Kim Woo Chul, Ha No Ra, Kim Yi Jin...

585
00:45:19,164 --> 00:45:20,715
and me, Cha Hyun Suk.

586
00:45:21,262 --> 00:45:23,393
It's something that involves
the four of us.

587
00:45:23,994 --> 00:45:27,763
Those people no longer matter,
nor have anything to do with me.

588
00:45:27,764 --> 00:45:32,082
Kim Yi Jin, you're very smart, so focus
and listen carefully to what I'm saying.

589
00:45:32,083 --> 00:45:36,533
I saw a very interesting post
on Space Host.

590
00:45:36,534 --> 00:45:38,184
The Professor K list.

591
00:45:40,702 --> 00:45:42,974
What does that have to do with me?

592
00:45:43,434 --> 00:45:46,699
It was like deja vu.

593
00:45:47,726 --> 00:45:50,007
It reminded me of
Professor Choi Kyu Won's scandal.

594
00:45:51,777 --> 00:45:55,866
Everyone knew Professor Cho Kyu Won
was pathetic and took money from students.

595
00:45:55,867 --> 00:45:57,630
But how was it discovered?

596
00:46:01,619 --> 00:46:03,380
It was because of this picture.

597
00:46:06,271 --> 00:46:10,160
One day, this picture happened to be
posted on social media.

598
00:46:10,161 --> 00:46:15,892
And amazingly, Professor Choi Kyu Won
is accepting bribe money behind them.

599
00:46:15,893 --> 00:46:19,118
Ah, and amazingly another person
pointed out...

600
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:22,321
"Oh look! It's Choi Kyu Won."

601
00:46:22,322 --> 00:46:25,113
And said, "I think it's money in there."

602
00:46:25,114 --> 00:46:27,386
Someone else poured
more gas onto the fire.

603
00:46:27,387 --> 00:46:32,317
This was on the news, I know it already.
Why are you telling me?

604
00:46:32,318 --> 00:46:36,358
Because all of it was constructed by you.

605
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:41,685
What did you say? Why would I do that?

606
00:46:41,686 --> 00:46:43,021
Ah...

607
00:46:43,523 --> 00:46:49,175
Because Professor Kim Woo Chul got
hired after Choi Kyu Won was dismissed?

608
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:51,566
That was your plan.

609
00:46:51,567 --> 00:46:54,475
So, No Ra had no idea her husband
was coming to Woocheon University.

610
00:46:54,476 --> 00:46:59,267
And Professor Kim Woo Chul did everything
he could to stop No Ra from attending.

611
00:46:59,268 --> 00:47:02,108
Don't talk about that couple
in front of me!

612
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:07,114
These students... Choi Soo Hyun
Business Major, Class of 2013.

613
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:09,896
And Ko Mi Ran, Youth Education Major.
Class of 2013.

614
00:47:11,717 --> 00:47:13,264
What about it?

615
00:47:14,295 --> 00:47:18,134
Choi Soo Hyun put up the post
about Professor K.

616
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:22,204
Ko Mi Ran put up the reply
mentioning Kim Woo Chul.

617
00:47:24,583 --> 00:47:26,629
I couldn't contact either of them.

618
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:28,451
They are both from the rural area.

619
00:47:28,452 --> 00:47:32,757
Both of their parents think they're away
on a working holiday.

620
00:47:33,467 --> 00:47:36,075
This has nothing to do with me.

621
00:47:36,076 --> 00:47:38,708
I can find out where they went.

622
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,729
You know that, right?

623
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:43,889
I've lived in Russia and Europe.
I've traveled all over the world too.

624
00:47:45,577 --> 00:47:49,571
But, I won't bother looking for them.

625
00:47:49,572 --> 00:47:51,704
It takes too much time.

626
00:47:53,251 --> 00:47:58,190
Instead, I'll put up one post
on Space Host.

627
00:47:59,766 --> 00:48:05,114
"Kim Yi Jin, the only daughter of the
Chairman of the Board and Congressman..."

628
00:48:05,731 --> 00:48:07,809
"had an affair
with Professor Kim Woo Chul."

629
00:48:10,186 --> 00:48:11,684
Do you have evidence?

630
00:48:12,153 --> 00:48:15,119
What will you say if I told you
I have CCTV from the Massa Maren theater?

631
00:48:18,135 --> 00:48:21,533
If the reason you're trying to make
Kim Woo Chul hit rock bottom

632
00:48:21,534 --> 00:48:25,765
is because of your anger at him for
having unresolved feelings for Ha No Ra...

633
00:48:25,766 --> 00:48:27,472
Just step on Kim Woo Chul alone.

634
00:48:29,125 --> 00:48:32,085
Don't harm No Ra and No Ra's son.

635
00:48:33,106 --> 00:48:35,303
So this was all because of Ha No Ra?

636
00:48:35,304 --> 00:48:37,415
This overreaction from you.

637
00:48:37,416 --> 00:48:42,872
The son of the man you once loved
attends Woocheon University.

638
00:48:42,873 --> 00:48:44,503
Did you even think of that?

639
00:48:47,353 --> 00:48:51,384
If you do crush Kim Woo Chul,
what will you get out of it?

640
00:48:52,873 --> 00:48:56,421
Letting off steam
for the betrayal of your pure love?

641
00:48:56,422 --> 00:49:00,553
No... you were not pure.

642
00:49:00,554 --> 00:49:04,605
You had the most out of the four of us,
and you didn't lose anything.

643
00:49:07,572 --> 00:49:11,656
Take down that post right away.

644
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:14,000
Before No Ra and Min Soo see it.

645
00:49:14,001 --> 00:49:17,461
If you take care of it too late and
something happens to Kim Woo Chul...

646
00:49:18,668 --> 00:49:20,469
you know what I'll do.

647
00:49:24,608 --> 00:49:27,310
You did love him once.

648
00:49:27,311 --> 00:49:31,463
If you do that to him,
how many days will you feel good about it?

649
00:49:32,632 --> 00:49:35,242
Three days? Two?

650
00:49:36,818 --> 00:49:37,972
One day?

Hello, this is Ha No Ra who was supposed
to start pre-performance work next month.

653
00:49:53,764 --> 00:49:58,373
I'm really sorry, but it turns out
that I can't do the job.

654
00:50:00,043 --> 00:50:01,710
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I haven't eaten yet.
I ran over to eat with you.

Let's go.

666
00:51:04,992 --> 00:51:07,477
How about hot, boiling Budae stew?

667
00:51:07,478 --> 00:51:10,179
Budae stew?

668
00:51:18,452 --> 00:51:20,436
That's what I wanted.

669
00:51:23,603 --> 00:51:27,088
I wanted to walk together on this campus.

Why didn't you tell me earlier...
Why didn't you speak up!

673
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:26,145
"Sorry, I don't feel
the same way anymore."

674
00:52:26,146 --> 00:52:29,588
Why didn't you say that
instead of making me this way?

675
00:52:31,492 --> 00:52:34,721
I wanted to say that,
and I was about to text you to meet.

What happened?

679
00:53:17,954 --> 00:53:21,846
Cha Hyun Suk, who exactly are you?

680

It wasn't because of you.

What?

686

If something goes wrong with you,
then your son will be unhappy.

If Min Soo is unhappy,
then No Ra will be even more unhappy.

He saved me.

He's trying to be cool.

Is he really that cool,

I was just doing what I could for you.

Thank you... thank you.

Why is that difficult?

I didn't do it to show you anything.

My father passed away
when I was two years old.

And my mother left me
when I was five years old.

The reason? I don't have one.

At first, I bothered you
