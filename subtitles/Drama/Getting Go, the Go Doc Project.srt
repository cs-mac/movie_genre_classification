1
00:04:11,863 --> 00:04:14,056
"The Road To Reality".

2
00:04:15,517 --> 00:04:18,124
Don't wanna be going there.

3
00:04:21,856 --> 00:04:23,749
Hiya.

4
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:27,553
An oasis of calm in here, mad out there.

5
00:04:32,283 --> 00:04:34,809
Gorgeous day for it, though, innit?

6
00:04:37,622 --> 00:04:39,815
Never been in here before.

7
00:05:07,694 --> 00:05:09,886
I like your hat.

8
00:05:34,387 --> 00:05:36,081
Busy?

9
00:05:38,683 --> 00:05:40,776
Hello?

10
00:05:44,314 --> 00:05:45,889
Having a bad day?

11
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,150
No.

12
00:05:48,151 --> 00:05:50,640
Oh. Not till I showed up, eh?

13
00:05:52,572 --> 00:05:54,823
Look like a rabbit caught in the headlights.

14
00:05:54,824 --> 00:05:56,435
<i>I won't bite.</i>

15
00:05:57,076 --> 00:05:59,269
Don't worry, I'm going now.

16
00:05:59,746 --> 00:06:02,863
Have a good day. Stay happy.

17
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:07,234
I ain't nicked nothing. Honest, guv'nor.

18
00:06:07,712 --> 00:06:10,320
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

19
00:06:21,518 --> 00:06:23,924
Oh, no, no, come on.

20
00:06:30,193 --> 00:06:32,386
That's just brilliant, that is.

21
00:06:36,157 --> 00:06:39,062
Oh, no, I didn't even get a chance
to say goodbye.

22
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:51,171
 <i>You'll never get it right</i>
<i>cos when you're laid in bed at night</i>

23
00:06:51,172 --> 00:06:54,508
 <i>Watching...</i>
<i>roaches climb the wall</i>

24
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:57,876
 <i>If you called your dad
he could stop it all</i>

25
00:06:58,471 --> 00:07:01,306
 <i>You'll never live like common people</i>

26
00:07:01,307 --> 00:07:04,601
 <i>You'll never do what common people do</i>

27
00:07:04,602 --> 00:07:07,396
 <i>You'll never fail like common people</i>

28
00:07:07,397 --> 00:07:10,966
 <i>You'll never watch your
life slide out of view</i>

29
00:07:11,568 --> 00:07:14,403
 <i>And dance and drink and screw</i>

30
00:07:14,404 --> 00:07:16,596
 <i>Because there's nothing else to do</i>

31
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,391
The music's stopped.

32
00:07:44,392 --> 00:07:46,051
It stopped ages ago.

33
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,756
Yeah, I was just enjoying the silence.

34
00:07:52,817 --> 00:07:54,393
<i>What?</i>

35
00:07:55,195 --> 00:07:57,070
What's so funny?

36
00:07:57,071 --> 00:08:00,142
I don't know!

37
00:08:01,409 --> 00:08:03,269
Can you just...

38
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,147
Oh, your sister's woken up, Poppy.

39
00:08:07,499 --> 00:08:09,291
<i>Suzy, what's that?</i>

40
00:08:09,292 --> 00:08:11,543
<i>What is it? Is that your latest conquest?</i>

41
00:08:11,544 --> 00:08:14,496
Oh, bless him!

42
00:08:15,798 --> 00:08:18,454
Don't you ever pray that
you're adopted, Suzy?

43
00:08:19,636 --> 00:08:21,828
Yeah.

44
00:08:22,806 --> 00:08:25,045
You got me, Zoe.

45
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,227
Who are you shushing?

46
00:08:28,228 --> 00:08:30,437
No, no, no, no, no, no.

47
00:08:30,438 --> 00:08:35,442
She's right. Let's all
enjoy the silence together.

48
00:08:35,443 --> 00:08:40,222
Dawn, will you shut up?
Because no-one else can get a word in.

49
00:08:42,992 --> 00:08:44,687
Sorry!

50
00:08:45,537 --> 00:08:48,455
Fingers on lips.

51
00:08:48,456 --> 00:08:50,207
Fingers on the tits.

52
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,376
- Fingers on tits.
- Fingers on the hips.

53
00:08:52,377 --> 00:08:54,534
Can I borrow yours?

54
00:08:56,673 --> 00:08:59,874
- Fingers on the tits.
- Oh, that is properly disgusting.

55
00:09:00,051 --> 00:09:01,760
Chicken fillets. Lunch, anyone?

56
00:09:01,761 --> 00:09:03,679
- Oh, hello!
<i>- Can I have a go?</i>

57
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,140
Of course you can, Dawn,
you don't need to ask.

58
00:09:06,141 --> 00:09:09,176
- Anyone over there?
- Oh, I know where that's been.

59
00:09:10,687 --> 00:09:12,938
You have gone down in my estimation.

60
00:09:12,939 --> 00:09:14,857
I'm sorry, Alice.

61
00:09:14,858 --> 00:09:18,360
- I don't get why you wear them, Poppy.
- Oh, don't you?

62
00:09:18,361 --> 00:09:21,780
I mean, you just put them in your bra...

63
00:09:21,781 --> 00:09:22,739
Yeah?

64
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:25,701
I like the way they make me feel, Suzy.

65
00:09:25,702 --> 00:09:28,287
- Like a natural woman.
<i>- That's right.</i>

66
00:09:28,288 --> 00:09:30,831
- I think it's in the wrong place.
- Ah, whoop!

67
00:09:30,832 --> 00:09:32,624
Oh, look, you've got three tits!

68
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,668
She's like you, Zoe.

69
00:09:34,669 --> 00:09:36,587
- No, that's three nipples.
<i>- Oh, right.</i>

70
00:09:36,588 --> 00:09:38,330
Have you got three nipples?

71
00:09:39,632 --> 00:09:44,678
She doesn't like to talk about it.
I'm going to give her a little hug.

72
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:47,347
- Over you go.
- Oh, that's quite nice. Do that again.

73
00:09:47,348 --> 00:09:49,541
Oh, really? Oh!

74
00:09:56,024 --> 00:09:58,275
Your cleavage looks great from up here.

75
00:09:58,276 --> 00:10:00,469
- Thank you.
- I've got a bird's eye view.

76
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:03,489
Come on, ladies, cop a load of this.

77
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,365
Oh, yeah, roll up, roll up.

78
00:10:05,366 --> 00:10:06,909
Look at that!

79
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,536
- It's good, isn't it?
- They're amazing.

80
00:10:09,537 --> 00:10:11,646
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

81
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:16,446
I think we know where
Poppy's sleeping tonight.

82
00:10:25,053 --> 00:10:26,553
Morning.

83
00:10:26,554 --> 00:10:28,747
Time to get up, sleepyhead.

84
00:10:31,017 --> 00:10:33,210
Cup of tea here.

85
00:10:34,187 --> 00:10:36,759
Come on. You can do it.

86
00:10:37,565 --> 00:10:41,181
That's it. That's it, nearly there.

87
00:10:42,028 --> 00:10:44,404
Oh, here we go.

88
00:10:44,405 --> 00:10:47,606
- And she's up! Hey.
- Thanks.

89
00:10:49,702 --> 00:10:51,119
You all right?

90
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,455
Yeah, I slept good.

91
00:10:53,456 --> 00:10:55,666
I heard you.

92
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:58,585
You always start that.

93
00:10:58,586 --> 00:11:00,826
- I don't snore.
- I know. You never have.

94
00:11:01,422 --> 00:11:03,615
- I don't.
- I don't.

95
00:11:10,974 --> 00:11:14,017
- Are they still asleep?
- No, they buggered off ages ago.

96
00:11:14,018 --> 00:11:15,227
- Did they?
- Yeah.

97
00:11:15,228 --> 00:11:17,479
Oh, right.

98
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,432
- What's the time?
- About 10 past 12.

99
00:11:21,317 --> 00:11:24,069
- They've got a bit of work to do.
- Have they?

100
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:27,781
- Dawn's late with her dissertation.
- Oh, no. When are your exams?

101
00:11:27,782 --> 00:11:29,867
- Three weeks tomorrow.
- You'll be all right.

102
00:11:29,868 --> 00:11:33,328
Yeah. I'm totally chilled out about it.

103
00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:34,788
Of course you are.

104
00:11:34,789 --> 00:11:36,982
- I'm cool.
- Yeah.

105
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,793
I'm just really stressed.

106
00:11:39,794 --> 00:11:42,236
What? Like an Eskimo with a headache?

107
00:11:44,549 --> 00:11:46,675
- Does anyone want any toast?
<i>Yeah.</i>

108
00:11:46,676 --> 00:11:48,969
- Yes, please.
- With marmalade, two slices.

109
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,512
Yeah, I know, cut on the diagonal.

110
00:11:50,513 --> 00:11:52,306
- Yeah.
- No crusts.

111
00:11:52,307 --> 00:11:55,626
- Got it. Oh, do you know what?
<i>- What?</i>

112
00:11:57,604 --> 00:11:59,688
- Oh, yeah.
- She's gone.

113
00:11:59,689 --> 00:12:02,274
The thing is,
we're starting with criminal justice.

114
00:12:02,275 --> 00:12:04,735
- Is that your first exam?
- Yeah, it's crap.

115
00:12:04,736 --> 00:12:09,448
If we had cyber crime first,
or, like, crime and pleasure,

116
00:12:09,449 --> 00:12:11,867
I could ease myself into it.

117
00:12:11,868 --> 00:12:14,244
- No probs.
- Oh, you'll be all right, Suzy.

118
00:12:14,245 --> 00:12:17,122
Yeah, if we can get a degree, any idiot can.

119
00:12:17,123 --> 00:12:20,167
- You calling your sister an idiot?
- Calling you an idiot.

120
00:12:20,168 --> 00:12:21,543
Thank you.

121
00:12:21,544 --> 00:12:23,795
"Crime and pleasure", now that sounds good.

122
00:12:23,796 --> 00:12:26,036
- Sounds like last night.
- Yeah.

123
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:28,884
You'll be all right.

124
00:12:28,885 --> 00:12:31,243
Yeah.

125
00:12:33,556 --> 00:12:35,057
- See you later.
- Alligator.

126
00:12:35,058 --> 00:12:37,768
- When are we going to see Helen?
- Yeah, when's the baby due?

127
00:12:37,769 --> 00:12:39,728
Don't know, soon. She's been texting me.

128
00:12:39,729 --> 00:12:42,064
- Me too, she's getting worse.
- I know, bless her.

129
00:12:42,065 --> 00:12:44,733
- Want to wait till after your exams?
- I want to get it over with.

130
00:12:44,734 --> 00:12:47,569
All right. Don't worry, leave her to me.

131
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:52,074
- Text me, yeah?
- Work hard.

132
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:54,660
Suze... you know it's that way, don't you?

133
00:12:54,661 --> 00:12:56,853
Oh, yeah.

134
00:13:14,806 --> 00:13:17,099
- These make good legs?
- Great.

135
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,292
<i> I'm so excited...</i>

136
00:13:49,257 --> 00:13:52,009
- It would be amazing to fly, wouldn't it?
- You reckon?

137
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,202
Just... whoosh!

138
00:13:54,929 --> 00:13:57,806
- What? Like Mr Vertigo?
- Oh, yeah. I love that book.

139
00:13:57,807 --> 00:13:59,266
- Yeah.
- Oh, vultures.

140
00:13:59,267 --> 00:14:02,019
- Met a few of them.
- These could be useful.

141
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,897
Oh, yeah, they're great.
Oh, look at him, he's gorgeous.

142
00:14:04,898 --> 00:14:06,815
We could do an owl, they've got big heads.

143
00:14:06,816 --> 00:14:09,359
Good idea. He's got your eyes, look.

144
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,612
- Cheers, Poppy.
- No, they're lovely.

145
00:14:11,613 --> 00:14:13,030
Do penguins emigrate?

146
00:14:13,031 --> 00:14:15,199
What? Do they move to the Costa del Sol?

147
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,992
Emigrate, migrate, whatever.

148
00:14:16,993 --> 00:14:19,828
- What about parrots?
- Oh, yeah, definitely.

149
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:22,873
- Or a toucan. Oh, look at his beak.
<i>- They're good colours.</i>

150
00:14:22,874 --> 00:14:25,067
Beautiful.

151
00:14:28,796 --> 00:14:30,631
So, are you going to get another bike?

152
00:14:30,632 --> 00:14:34,301
Oh, no, I couldn't replace my old lovely.
It's flown the nest now.

153
00:14:34,302 --> 00:14:36,345
Definitely going to learn to drive, though.

154
00:14:36,346 --> 00:14:38,123
- Going to book lessons?
- Might do.

155
00:14:38,681 --> 00:14:39,848
Might not.

156
00:14:39,849 --> 00:14:43,050
I told you, you're not
learning to drive in my car.

157
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,023
Nutter.

158
00:14:48,024 --> 00:14:51,068
- Chickens, we could do chickens.
- Chickens don't fly.

159
00:14:51,069 --> 00:14:54,488
Lazy buggers.
What are we going to make, then?

160
00:14:54,489 --> 00:14:57,394
- I don't know. What do you think?
- I don't know.

161
00:14:59,661 --> 00:15:01,411
- Where are they?
- Here.

162
00:15:01,412 --> 00:15:04,456
- That far apart, are they?
- Yeah. Don't poke me.

163
00:15:04,457 --> 00:15:06,650
Wasn't going near you.

164
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,113
- Go on, then.
- Great.

165
00:15:16,136 --> 00:15:18,637
You should ask an adult to help you.

166
00:15:18,638 --> 00:15:20,831
I don't know any.

167
00:15:31,484 --> 00:15:35,219
- I think they're quite good.
- Yeah, what do you reckon?

168
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,367
- I think we could pull in these.
<i>- Definitely.</i>

169
00:15:40,368 --> 00:15:42,661
- Pub?
- Yeah, hair of the dog.

170
00:15:42,662 --> 00:15:46,278
I'm ready. Put a bit of
lippy on and away we go.

171
00:16:07,061 --> 00:16:09,752
- Hi, Liz.
- Hi, Zoe. How are you?

172
00:16:22,118 --> 00:16:24,311
Didn't expect that one!

173
00:16:37,801 --> 00:16:38,967
Morning, Tina.

174
00:16:38,968 --> 00:16:44,723
Birds that live here in North America,
they fly all the way to South America.

175
00:16:44,724 --> 00:16:45,724
Yeah?

176
00:16:45,725 --> 00:16:48,560
<i>That's a journey and a half, isn't it?</i>

177
00:16:48,561 --> 00:16:52,189
But the... the biggest journey of them all
is of the arctic tern.

178
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,274
Because he flies from the Arctic...

179
00:16:54,275 --> 00:17:01,189
Yeah?... all the way - wow,
across the world - to the South Pole.

180
00:17:01,699 --> 00:17:03,033
Isn't that incredible?

181
00:17:03,034 --> 00:17:06,245
From the North to the South Pole
and that is... ssh!

182
00:17:06,246 --> 00:17:10,207
And that is 9,300 miles. That's right.

183
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,447
Wow, wow.

184
00:17:19,175 --> 00:17:22,177
All right, Nick, do the other side now.

185
00:17:22,178 --> 00:17:25,165
<i>Here we go, look.
No, don't pull it out.</i>

186
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:32,259
What we can do... Shall we give him...
Shall we give him a few bits?

187
00:17:33,356 --> 00:17:36,066
Do you want to give him...
I like that, I like that.

188
00:17:36,067 --> 00:17:38,277
<i>- Shall we give him one here?
- No.</i>

189
00:17:38,278 --> 00:17:39,592
<i>No?</i>

190
00:17:40,864 --> 00:17:43,866
He's got eyebrows, look.

191
00:17:43,867 --> 00:17:46,059
- Yeah?
<i>- Let me see.</i>

192
00:17:47,871 --> 00:17:50,706
I think that's brilliant. That's brilliant.

193
00:17:50,707 --> 00:17:52,666
Here we go.

194
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:55,156
Shall I put some more yellow in that?
There we go.

195
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:58,130
<i>What colours do you think
your feathers could be?</i>

196
00:17:58,131 --> 00:18:01,175
See, you could do a rainbow colour.
That's a good idea, isn't it?

197
00:18:01,176 --> 00:18:05,220
- I did a rainbow.
- Do a rainbow. Rainbows like parrots.

198
00:18:05,221 --> 00:18:07,081
<i>Don't put that on yet.</i>

199
00:18:10,226 --> 00:18:11,968
<i>Let's have a look.</i>

200
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:15,105
Little bit more. What about the fringing?

201
00:18:15,106 --> 00:18:17,900
You could do a bit more
on the fringing there, couldn't you?

202
00:18:17,901 --> 00:18:20,694
Hungry? It's going to be lunch time soon.

203
00:18:20,695 --> 00:18:23,405
But I'm not a cook.
It's lunch time in a minute.

204
00:18:23,406 --> 00:18:25,032
We're going to lunch in a minute.

205
00:18:25,033 --> 00:18:27,075
You can wash your hands.

206
00:18:27,076 --> 00:18:28,827
Who's ready?

207
00:18:28,828 --> 00:18:31,021
Hey!

208
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:41,119
Oh, wow! That is fantastic.
Look at you go!

209
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:46,247
Whooh! Flap your arms. Flap your wings.

210
00:18:51,351 --> 00:18:52,962
Bit dangerous, innit?

211
00:18:54,103 --> 00:18:55,479
What?

212
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,314
Putting these over their heads.

213
00:18:57,315 --> 00:19:00,682
I'm trying to suffocate them.
That's my goal. Little buggers.

214
00:19:02,445 --> 00:19:05,072
- They look great.
<i>- How was your weekend?</i>

215
00:19:05,073 --> 00:19:07,366
- Crap.
- Oh, no, why's that, then?

216
00:19:07,367 --> 00:19:09,660
I didn't do much, just stayed in, really.

217
00:19:09,661 --> 00:19:11,036
It's the weekend, Tash.

218
00:19:11,037 --> 00:19:13,539
- I know. I had a run-in with my mum.
<i>- Did ya?</i>

219
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:17,543
Mm. My sister was working Saturday.
I had to look after Jasmine.

220
00:19:17,544 --> 00:19:20,212
- How is she?
- That girl eats too much.

221
00:19:20,213 --> 00:19:21,463
Bless her.

222
00:19:21,464 --> 00:19:23,607
She ate three chicken legs
and four jam tarts

223
00:19:23,608 --> 00:19:25,592
and then wants to tell me she's starving.

224
00:19:25,593 --> 00:19:26,927
The little piglet.

225
00:19:26,928 --> 00:19:29,388
- I dropped her off to my mum's.
<i>- Yeah?</i>

226
00:19:29,389 --> 00:19:33,183
I said you've got to tell Sherryanne
that she needs to put this girl on a diet.

227
00:19:33,184 --> 00:19:34,768
You'll give her a complex, she's 7.

228
00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:38,438
All of a sudden Mum doesn't want to get
involved, for the first time in her life.

229
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:41,900
Then I'm just leaving the house
and my two aunts arrive from Dollis Hill.

230
00:19:41,901 --> 00:19:43,026
Oh, no.

231
00:19:43,027 --> 00:19:46,947
So we get the Spanish Inquisition.
"Tash, you got a boyfriend?

232
00:19:46,948 --> 00:19:51,160
"Are you getting married soon? Why don't you
give your mother another grandchild?

233
00:19:51,161 --> 00:19:53,686
"You know she nearly 60. She getting old."

234
00:19:54,622 --> 00:19:58,167
I was, like, "I haven't got a boyfriend.
I won't be getting married soon,

235
00:19:58,168 --> 00:20:01,086
and, no, I won't be investing
in a mortgage in the near future,

236
00:20:01,087 --> 00:20:02,671
thank you very much."

237
00:20:02,672 --> 00:20:05,493
- Then I just closed the door and left.
- End of.

238
00:20:26,196 --> 00:20:28,030
- You cooking?
- Yeah, are you cooking?

239
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,865
I'm cooking with gas. What we having?

240
00:20:29,866 --> 00:20:31,575
- Food.
- That makes a change.

241
00:20:31,576 --> 00:20:33,160
- Are you hungry?
- I'm ravishing.

242
00:20:33,161 --> 00:20:35,496
- Aren't you just.
- Thank you.

243
00:20:35,497 --> 00:20:36,872
How did it go today?

244
00:20:36,873 --> 00:20:39,124
What, with my
flying flock of feathered friends?

245
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,335
Good, they loved it.
Flapping away they were.

246
00:20:41,336 --> 00:20:42,836
- Were they?
- Yeah, bless them.

247
00:20:42,837 --> 00:20:46,423
I had to nip it in the bud with my lot
before they flew out the window.

248
00:20:46,424 --> 00:20:47,883
It was OK, though, was it?

249
00:20:47,884 --> 00:20:51,178
Oh, yeah, I played them Stravinsky
after lunch just to calm them down.

250
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:54,056
- What did you play?
- The Rite Of Spring.

251
00:20:54,057 --> 00:20:55,933
I booked my first driving lesson.

252
00:20:55,934 --> 00:20:57,142
- Did you?
- Yeah.

253
00:20:57,143 --> 00:20:58,936
- When is it?
- 12 o'clock, Saturday.

254
00:20:58,937 --> 00:21:01,230
Excellent, well done you.

255
00:21:01,231 --> 00:21:04,100
- I'll set the table.
- Yeah, it's nearly ready.

256
00:21:15,912 --> 00:21:17,538
Yeah, I know.

257
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:19,706
<i>I love the end of the week.
- You don't say.</i>

258
00:21:19,707 --> 00:21:21,250
- I do, actually.
- Do you?

259
00:21:21,251 --> 00:21:22,751
- Yeah.
- Oh.

260
00:21:22,752 --> 00:21:25,963
You know I take this dance class
on a Friday afternoon, the golden time.

261
00:21:25,964 --> 00:21:28,465
<i>I swear to God,
half the kids are bigger than me.</i>

262
00:21:28,466 --> 00:21:32,886
- That's not hard, though, is it, eh, titch?
- No, I don't mean taller, I mean wider.

263
00:21:32,887 --> 00:21:34,346
You want to be careful, you know?

264
00:21:34,347 --> 00:21:38,475
You don't want the kids jumping about
expressing themselves. A bit dangerous.

265
00:21:38,476 --> 00:21:40,060
Yeah, you do all that on Friday,

266
00:21:40,061 --> 00:21:43,981
but then they spend the weekend indoors,
glued to their Nintendo DS.

267
00:21:43,982 --> 00:21:46,150
Totally. A couple of weeks ago
I came in Monday -

268
00:21:46,151 --> 00:21:48,485
I told Poppy -
sat the kids down for carpet time,

269
00:21:48,486 --> 00:21:50,571
asked them what they did over the weekend.

270
00:21:50,572 --> 00:21:52,948
<i>Gorgeous weather.
Not one of them had been out.</i>

271
00:21:52,949 --> 00:21:55,450
They'd all been sitting at home
on their PlayStations.

272
00:21:55,451 --> 00:21:58,996
- You couldn't get them up off the carpet.
- When they got up, they were wheezing.

273
00:21:58,997 --> 00:22:02,374
- That's pollution for you.
- We always used to go to the park.

274
00:22:02,375 --> 00:22:05,544
<i>- A lot of them don't have parks to go to.</i>
- Yeah, exactly.

275
00:22:05,545 --> 00:22:07,504
But you don't need a park to go for a walk.

276
00:22:07,505 --> 00:22:09,464
If Mum and Dad don't go out, the kids don't.

277
00:22:09,465 --> 00:22:11,967
Parents are too frightened
to let their kids play out.

278
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:14,761
Even a bit of green by the estate,
they don't let them play there.

279
00:22:14,762 --> 00:22:16,972
But it's hard for a lot
of mums and dads, isn't it?

280
00:22:16,973 --> 00:22:19,933
They've had a hell of a week.
They're under pressure and stress.

281
00:22:19,934 --> 00:22:23,145
- Tell me about it.
<i>- They get back from work, if they work...</i>

282
00:22:23,146 --> 00:22:26,315
You know. A lot of them are
single mums, they're exhausted.

283
00:22:26,316 --> 00:22:30,402
It's understandable if they don't take
their kids out for a lovely picnic.

284
00:22:30,403 --> 00:22:34,114
It's not acceptable. Life's hard, but if
you want to find a way you find it, innit?

285
00:22:34,115 --> 00:22:36,533
<i>- Some parents can't be bothered.</i>
- Yeah, I know.

286
00:22:36,534 --> 00:22:39,578
So instead they let their kids
stay up half the night on chat rooms.

287
00:22:39,579 --> 00:22:41,830
- Yeah!
- Yeah, that's worrying.

288
00:22:41,831 --> 00:22:44,583
- Scary.
- Makes me so angry.

289
00:22:44,584 --> 00:22:47,878
A lot of seven-year-olds know more
about the internet than we do.

290
00:22:47,879 --> 00:22:50,255
At least people are talking about it.
That's good.

291
00:22:50,256 --> 00:22:52,966
- Is it?
- Well, yeah. It means we're aware.

292
00:22:52,967 --> 00:22:55,636
I'm aware smoking's bad for me.
It doesn't mean I'll stop.

293
00:22:55,637 --> 00:22:57,846
- As long as you know what will kill you.
<i>- Thanks.</i>

294
00:22:57,847 --> 00:22:59,014
Any time.

295
00:22:59,015 --> 00:23:02,184
I know drinking's bad for me,
but, you know... I can't help myself.

296
00:23:02,185 --> 00:23:04,378
- Oh, shame.
- Cheers!

297
00:23:05,021 --> 00:23:09,349
Cheers, everyone! Here's to our livers
and all who drown in them.

298
00:23:10,026 --> 00:23:12,861
Careful, Poppy, you got your first
driving lesson tomorrow.

299
00:23:12,862 --> 00:23:14,696
Oh, yeah, quick, put that down.

300
00:23:14,697 --> 00:23:16,740
You don't want to mess up your blind spot.

301
00:23:16,741 --> 00:23:20,144
- Oh, that sounds good.
- Oh, it's here. How many fingers?

302
00:23:27,877 --> 00:23:30,504
- That must be for you.
- I'm so excited!

303
00:23:30,505 --> 00:23:33,215
You should do some deep breathing
before you get in the car.

304
00:23:33,216 --> 00:23:36,093
Ooh, can't see him. Wish me luck.

305
00:23:36,094 --> 00:23:39,680
Good luck. I'll keep the emergency
services on standby.

306
00:23:39,681 --> 00:23:42,716
<i>Any excuse, eh?
I know what you're like with firemen.</i>

307
00:23:46,896 --> 00:23:48,507
Hello. Scott?

308
00:23:49,816 --> 00:23:52,067
- Are you Poppy?
- That's me. Nice to you meet you.

309
00:23:52,068 --> 00:23:53,902
Right, the car's just here.

310
00:23:53,903 --> 00:23:56,280
They're not infected! What are you like?

311
00:23:56,281 --> 00:24:00,242
They're clean, I just washed them specially,
honest.

312
00:24:00,243 --> 00:24:02,202
- This it?
- You get in the passenger seat.

313
00:24:02,203 --> 00:24:05,747
- You know it's me learning to drive?
- We have to talk a few things through.

314
00:24:05,748 --> 00:24:08,107
Oh, have we? Fair enough. If you insist.

315
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:14,047
- Did you choose this colour car?
- Make yourself comfortable.

316
00:24:14,048 --> 00:24:17,468
- Thank you. Is this your car?
- No, it's the company's car.

317
00:24:17,469 --> 00:24:19,928
- Oh, right, what's your car like, then?
- It is my car.

318
00:24:19,929 --> 00:24:22,347
You said it was the company's car.
Make your mind up.

319
00:24:22,348 --> 00:24:25,086
- Have you got your provisional licence?
- Yep!

320
00:24:25,768 --> 00:24:28,854
There you go. That's me on a bad day.

321
00:24:28,855 --> 00:24:30,964
- Is that your real name, Pauline?
- Right.

322
00:24:32,484 --> 00:24:35,444
- OK, everything seems to be in order.
- Does it? That's good.

323
00:24:35,445 --> 00:24:37,654
Now, have you ever had
a driving lesson before?

324
00:24:37,655 --> 00:24:41,658
Yeah. No, it wasn't really a lesson.
It was in a Cadillac in Miami.

325
00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:44,912
Bunny-hopped down the beach.
I was a bit pissed, it was hilarious.

326
00:24:44,913 --> 00:24:47,080
We won't be pissed
when driving this car, OK?

327
00:24:47,081 --> 00:24:49,958
We're not going to bunny-hop.
We'll focus and concentrate.

328
00:24:49,959 --> 00:24:52,669
I'm going to take you to a spot
we take all learner drivers.

329
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:55,297
- Are you?
- We'll go through the cockpit drill.

330
00:24:55,298 --> 00:24:58,550
- Oh, naughty.
- You'll listen and take responsibility.

331
00:24:58,551 --> 00:24:59,843
I'll see what I can do.

332
00:24:59,844 --> 00:25:02,962
- OK. Put your seat belt on.
- Will do, Captain Scott.

333
00:25:04,724 --> 00:25:06,798
Here we go, gigolo.

334
00:25:09,354 --> 00:25:12,189
- So you spoke to the office?
- I spoke to your boss.

335
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:15,317
He's not my boss, I work for myself.
I'm my own man.

336
00:25:15,318 --> 00:25:19,385
But it's his car...
or it's your car... Someone.

337
00:25:21,741 --> 00:25:24,493
And they told you the price, £22.50 an hour?

338
00:25:24,494 --> 00:25:26,328
That's right. Cheap as chips, you lot.

339
00:25:26,329 --> 00:25:28,497
- We may be cheap but we're better.
<i>- Are you?</i>

340
00:25:28,498 --> 00:25:31,667
You go with the big companies,
they use inexperienced instructors.

341
00:25:31,668 --> 00:25:32,918
They don't?

342
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:34,878
<i>They've just passed
their test and charge more.</i>

343
00:25:34,879 --> 00:25:35,629
Bastards.

344
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:39,758
Us experienced instructors, we go
with small companies and charge less.

345
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:43,011
- That makes a lot of sense, that does.
<i>- Cheapness is relative.</i>

346
00:25:43,012 --> 00:25:45,917
Yeah, it is. You're right. Bang-on!

347
00:25:46,891 --> 00:25:49,601
So, do you want the same time every week?

348
00:25:49,602 --> 00:25:50,811
Go on, then.

349
00:25:50,812 --> 00:25:53,772
- Do you or don't you? I need to know.
- Well, if you need to know.

350
00:25:53,773 --> 00:25:56,358
If it's good for you,
it's good for me, Scott.

351
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:58,552
OK, 12 o'clock every Saturday.

352
00:26:01,406 --> 00:26:05,784
- Do you like working Saturdays?
- I only work half day, Saturday.

353
00:26:05,785 --> 00:26:08,310
- Oh, that's good.
- You're my last pupil.

354
00:26:10,582 --> 00:26:14,910
What do you do for the rest of the day?
Are you going out tonight?

355
00:26:15,712 --> 00:26:17,963
I shall go home and read my book.

356
00:26:17,964 --> 00:26:21,165
Oh, it must be a good book. What is it?

357
00:26:22,177 --> 00:26:23,927
It's a book.

358
00:26:23,928 --> 00:26:26,335
Yeah, well, we worked that much out.

359
00:26:32,562 --> 00:26:35,230
- You see three pedals in front of you.
- Yeah, yeah.

360
00:26:35,231 --> 00:26:38,734
Will you put your left foot on the left-hand
pedal and push it all the way down?

361
00:26:38,735 --> 00:26:40,444
He's a bit frisky, isn't he?

362
00:26:40,445 --> 00:26:42,988
OK, Pauline.
Please take your boot off the pedal.

363
00:26:42,989 --> 00:26:46,783
Nobody's called me Pauline
since I was two years old. Makes me laugh.

364
00:26:46,784 --> 00:26:48,243
What am I supposed to call you?

365
00:26:48,244 --> 00:26:50,370
- Oh, how about Poppy?
- Poppy?

366
00:26:50,371 --> 00:26:51,872
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

367
00:26:51,873 --> 00:26:54,416
No, whatever turns you on, Scott.
I don't mind.

368
00:26:54,417 --> 00:26:57,878
OK, Poppy. Your boots are
inappropriate for a driving lesson.

369
00:26:57,879 --> 00:27:00,756
- What's wrong with them?
- You can't control a car in high heels.

370
00:27:00,757 --> 00:27:01,967
I can do a lot in these.

371
00:27:01,968 --> 00:27:04,301
You should see me in these on a dance floor.

372
00:27:04,302 --> 00:27:07,471
- They may be good on a dance floor.
- Not just good on a dance floor.

373
00:27:07,472 --> 00:27:08,597
They are "Oooh".

374
00:27:08,598 --> 00:27:10,474
They may be good in a Cadillac on a beach

375
00:27:10,475 --> 00:27:14,102
when you're pissed with your boyfriend,
but they're not suitable for driving.

376
00:27:14,103 --> 00:27:15,270
You're funny.

377
00:27:15,271 --> 00:27:17,815
Now, next week
I want you to bring flat-soled shoes.

378
00:27:17,816 --> 00:27:21,109
- I don't look any good in them.
- It's not how you look, it's how you drive.

379
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:23,127
I'll see what I can
rustle up for you, Scott.

380
00:27:23,128 --> 00:27:23,862
Leave it to me.

381
00:27:23,863 --> 00:27:25,280
Right, you see three mirrors -

382
00:27:25,281 --> 00:27:27,825
your two side-view mirrors
and your rear-view mirror.

383
00:27:27,826 --> 00:27:30,744
- They make a golden triangle.
- Is that like the pubic triangle?

384
00:27:30,745 --> 00:27:34,623
It's a pyramid and at the top of it
you see the all-seeing eye - Enrahah.

385
00:27:34,624 --> 00:27:37,668
Can you repeat that, please? "En-ra-hah".

386
00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:39,878
- You talking about the eye of Lucifer?
- No!

387
00:27:39,879 --> 00:27:42,297
Cos I don't know if I want to look in there,
thank you very much.

388
00:27:42,298 --> 00:27:45,217
It's not Lucifer. There are
two fallen angels before Lucifer.

389
00:27:45,218 --> 00:27:49,096
- There is Enrahah, Raziel and Lucifer.
- I don't have them in my phone book.

390
00:27:49,097 --> 00:27:50,556
- Bear with me.
- Where is he?

391
00:27:50,557 --> 00:27:52,057
- Bear with me.
- I can't see him.

392
00:27:52,058 --> 00:27:53,600
- It's a teaching tool.
- Is it?

393
00:27:53,601 --> 00:27:55,853
Let me explain something
to you about teaching.

394
00:27:55,854 --> 00:27:58,512
The teacher's job is to bring
out good habits in the pupil

395
00:27:58,513 --> 00:27:59,857
and to get rid of bad habits.

396
00:27:59,858 --> 00:28:02,568
He does that through
frequent repetitive thinking.

397
00:28:02,569 --> 00:28:05,112
And he does that by creating clear
and distinct images

398
00:28:05,113 --> 00:28:06,822
that are easy for the pupil to retain.

399
00:28:06,823 --> 00:28:09,015
- Oh, does he, now?
- Yes.

400
00:28:09,993 --> 00:28:12,077
Don't worry, it's burnt in there.

401
00:28:12,078 --> 00:28:14,913
You remember. You will remember
Enrahah till the day you die

402
00:28:14,914 --> 00:28:16,331
and I will have done my job.

403
00:28:16,332 --> 00:28:19,376
Why don't you have something nice up there
like a giant strawberry?

404
00:28:19,377 --> 00:28:21,086
Believe you me, it works.

405
00:28:21,087 --> 00:28:23,005
- OK, stop!
- What am I doing now?

406
00:28:23,006 --> 00:28:25,591
Please take your hand off the gear.
Off the gear stick!

407
00:28:25,592 --> 00:28:27,176
- All right.
- Foot off the pedal.

408
00:28:27,177 --> 00:28:30,053
- I'm not touching anything.
- Let me explain to you something.

409
00:28:30,054 --> 00:28:33,140
This car is my livelihood.
This car is how I earn my living.

410
00:28:33,141 --> 00:28:35,392
- I don't know how you earn your living.
- Yeah.

411
00:28:35,393 --> 00:28:38,353
But if I walked into your pub
or your discotheque or your club

412
00:28:38,354 --> 00:28:40,981
and I walked up to the DJ
and I scratched all his records,

413
00:28:40,982 --> 00:28:42,357
or I smashed all the glasses,

414
00:28:42,358 --> 00:28:46,737
and I said, "I'm sorry, I didn't know what
I was doing," that wouldn't be acceptable.

415
00:28:46,738 --> 00:28:48,572
There is only one problem with that.

416
00:28:48,573 --> 00:28:52,272
I don't own a bar or a disco.
I'm just a primary school teacher.

417
00:28:55,413 --> 00:28:57,606
- Are you?
- Afraid so, kiddo.

418
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,417
Are you a Satanist, Scott?

419
00:29:00,418 --> 00:29:04,379
- No, in fact I'm exactly the opposite.
- Are you the Pope, then?

420
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,368
- That's the same thing.
- Is it? Does he know that?

421
00:29:07,926 --> 00:29:12,387
Right, you have three pedals, A, B, C.
Accelerator, brake and clutch.

422
00:29:12,388 --> 00:29:13,722
<i>Talking about...</i>
Lovely.

423
00:29:13,723 --> 00:29:15,204
- Good.
- Yeah.

424
00:29:16,184 --> 00:29:17,643
What's he like?

425
00:29:17,644 --> 00:29:19,394
- You'd love him.
- Would I?

426
00:29:19,395 --> 00:29:21,647
He made me laugh. He was funny.

427
00:29:21,648 --> 00:29:23,732
What? Like funny "Ha ha" or funny peculiar?

428
00:29:23,733 --> 00:29:26,735
- Bit of both, actually.
- So, what happened, then?

429
00:29:26,736 --> 00:29:29,154
- He shouted at me.
- What? He gave you a telling off?

430
00:29:29,155 --> 00:29:31,240
He's a little bit uptight.
Just a little bit.

431
00:29:31,241 --> 00:29:33,992
- Bet you wound him up.
- Might set you up with him.

432
00:29:33,993 --> 00:29:36,036
- Is he fit?
- Yeah.

433
00:29:36,037 --> 00:29:38,247
No, he's not fit at all. Just your type.

434
00:29:38,248 --> 00:29:41,166
What do I get out of it?
- You get a shag whenever you want.

435
00:29:41,167 --> 00:29:42,918
When was the last time that happened?

436
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:47,631
Who's fault's that, eh?
Where are you going? Suzy!

437
00:29:47,632 --> 00:29:49,675
- You all right?
- All right?

438
00:29:49,676 --> 00:29:51,426
- What's going on?
- Come on.

439
00:29:51,427 --> 00:29:53,470
- You shouting at my little sister?
- No.

440
00:29:53,471 --> 00:29:55,597
- Doesn't look like it, does it?
- Poppy!

441
00:29:55,598 --> 00:29:57,641
- Where are you going?
- Fuck off!

442
00:29:57,642 --> 00:30:00,463
Not coming with us, apparently. Adios.

443
00:30:02,605 --> 00:30:04,798
Suze!

444
00:30:30,884 --> 00:30:33,076
Ooh.

445
00:30:34,596 --> 00:30:36,138
- Morning, Poppy.
- All right?

446
00:30:36,139 --> 00:30:38,515
- What's the matter?
- Buggered my back, haven't I?

447
00:30:38,516 --> 00:30:40,309
- Looks like it.
- Trampolining.

448
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:42,978
- Trampolining? Really?
- Yeah, I go every week.

449
00:30:42,979 --> 00:30:44,771
- What? After school?
- I love it.

450
00:30:44,772 --> 00:30:45,647
Great.

451
00:30:45,648 --> 00:30:47,691
You've got to keep the muscles a-pumping.

452
00:30:47,692 --> 00:30:49,943
- Cos I've just started flamenco.
- You haven't?

453
00:30:49,944 --> 00:30:52,988
- It's fantastic.
- I've always wanted to do it. Bit of that.

454
00:30:52,989 --> 00:30:54,323
- Careful.
- I'm all right.

455
00:30:54,324 --> 00:30:56,241
- Come along, if you want.
- When is it?

456
00:30:56,242 --> 00:30:57,951
Every Tuesday, 6:30.

457
00:30:57,952 --> 00:31:00,228
- Well, see how you feel.
- All right.

458
00:31:07,253 --> 00:31:09,446
- Morning, Leanne.
- Morning.

459
00:31:11,216 --> 00:31:12,966
Stink of urine round here.

460
00:31:12,967 --> 00:31:15,344
- I can't smell anything.
- Have you peed your pants?

461
00:31:15,345 --> 00:31:16,470
Yeah, sorry.

462
00:31:16,471 --> 00:31:18,430
- You're a naughty girl.
- Tell me about it.

463
00:31:18,431 --> 00:31:19,473
Ow!

464
00:31:19,474 --> 00:31:20,766
- You all right?
- Yeah.

465
00:31:20,767 --> 00:31:22,100
Come on, we're nearly there.

466
00:31:22,101 --> 00:31:25,479
- Have you lost your sense of smell?
- Yeah, smoking dulls your senses.

467
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,969
- And your brain. Here we go.
- Go on, then.

468
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,364
Done that.

469
00:31:35,365 --> 00:31:36,907
- All done?
- Yeah, thanks.

470
00:31:36,908 --> 00:31:38,158
OK.

471
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,202
Take care.

472
00:31:40,203 --> 00:31:42,996
- OK, who have we got next?
- Poppy Cross.

473
00:31:42,997 --> 00:31:43,956
Thanks.

474
00:31:43,957 --> 00:31:45,916
Poppy? No, I'm Zoe. Nice to meet you.

475
00:31:45,917 --> 00:31:48,377
No, I'm Poppy, sorry about her.
Don't know who she is.

476
00:31:48,378 --> 00:31:50,295
- My name's Ezra.
- Hello, Ezra.

477
00:31:50,296 --> 00:31:52,987
- You want to just follow me upstairs?
- Yeah.

478
00:31:54,008 --> 00:31:56,468
- You're big, aren't you?
Good luck!

479
00:31:56,469 --> 00:31:59,388
- Just take your time.
- What are you going to do to me?

480
00:31:59,389 --> 00:32:01,765
Ooh!

481
00:32:01,766 --> 00:32:04,017
Makes me laugh.

482
00:32:04,018 --> 00:32:06,770
OK, I'm just going to feel the muscles
in your back.

483
00:32:06,771 --> 00:32:09,231
- Right.
- And you let me know where the pain is.

484
00:32:09,232 --> 00:32:11,425
I'll send you a text.

485
00:32:12,819 --> 00:32:15,225
Strong fingers.

486
00:32:15,697 --> 00:32:18,185
That tickles.

487
00:32:19,742 --> 00:32:22,369
- Oooh! Bang on the money.
- OK.

488
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:25,414
- Ow...
- And this side?

489
00:32:25,415 --> 00:32:27,239
Yeah.

490
00:32:28,585 --> 00:32:32,421
OK. Do you want to reach down to your side
as if you're picking something up?

491
00:32:32,422 --> 00:32:34,590
Picking chickens.

492
00:32:34,591 --> 00:32:37,282
No, sorry. I can't do that. Ow! Oooh.

493
00:32:43,016 --> 00:32:44,850
Is it your back?

494
00:32:44,851 --> 00:32:45,934
Sorry?

495
00:32:45,935 --> 00:32:48,970
Cos it can affect everything, can't it?

496
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:58,013
Like your mood and everything.

497
00:33:02,035 --> 00:33:05,287
- Nice action.
- Lie on your back for me, please.

498
00:33:05,288 --> 00:33:08,999
Must get one of these. Come in very handy.

499
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,459
Oooh! Ow.

500
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:14,922
OK, I'm just going to ask you to roll
yourself onto your side, facing me.

501
00:33:14,923 --> 00:33:16,747
You don't ask for much do you, eh?

502
00:33:17,634 --> 00:33:20,159
I'm going to feel the
muscles in your spine again.

503
00:33:22,847 --> 00:33:24,589
Ooh.

504
00:33:28,478 --> 00:33:29,436
Oh!

505
00:33:29,437 --> 00:33:32,856
 What-d'you-ma-call-it,
ding dang dilly dilly da da, hoo-hoo!

506
00:33:32,857 --> 00:33:34,316
OK.

507
00:33:34,317 --> 00:33:36,675
All right, lie back.

508
00:33:38,238 --> 00:33:39,571
There we go.

509
00:33:39,572 --> 00:33:42,366
There's a joint in
your spine that's jammed up.

510
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:43,659
Oh, no.

511
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,994
- Would you like me to release it?
- Is it serious?

512
00:33:45,995 --> 00:33:48,497
- It's not too bad.
- What you going to do? Will it hurt?

513
00:33:48,498 --> 00:33:50,690
It may for a few days.

514
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:56,380
- Go on, then. Go for your life.
<i>- Are you sure?</i>

515
00:33:56,381 --> 00:33:57,965
If you're quick.

516
00:33:57,966 --> 00:34:03,373
OK. I'm going to roll you over and you'll
feel a short sharp click in your back.

517
00:34:04,222 --> 00:34:07,349
OK? Breathe in. And...

518
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:10,394
Oh. Wait a minute.

519
00:34:10,395 --> 00:34:12,521
OK. Are you ready?

520
00:34:12,522 --> 00:34:13,856
Yeah.

521
00:34:13,857 --> 00:34:16,150
OK, breathe in...

522
00:34:16,151 --> 00:34:18,944
- OK.
- And release.

523
00:34:18,945 --> 00:34:21,530
Oh, hoochy coochy ga-la!

524
00:34:21,531 --> 00:34:24,304
OK. Just relax for me.

525
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,744
Didn't know you were going to do that.

526
00:34:27,745 --> 00:34:29,830
Ooh.

527
00:34:29,831 --> 00:34:32,070
<i>Just relax and breathe normally.</i>

528
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:38,547
<i>- OK, would you like to sit up for me?</i>

529
00:34:38,548 --> 00:34:40,741
Yeah.

530
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,433
Will this be a regular occurrence,
chopping and changing?

531
00:34:49,434 --> 00:34:52,561
- Sorry, Scott. Something came up.
- I've got a life too, you know.

532
00:34:52,562 --> 00:34:55,355
- I had to make an appointment.
- Isn't this an appointment?

533
00:34:55,356 --> 00:34:57,191
I couldn't help it.

534
00:34:57,192 --> 00:34:59,693
The road to hell is paved
with good intentions.

535
00:34:59,694 --> 00:35:01,887
Sounds like fun.

536
00:35:04,157 --> 00:35:05,741
Having a bad day, are you?

537
00:35:05,742 --> 00:35:08,494
- I had a bad pupil this morning.
<i>- Oh, no, what did he do?</i>

538
00:35:08,495 --> 00:35:10,579
He was late, he refused to pay his money.

539
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,206
He slammed the door and swore at me.

540
00:35:12,207 --> 00:35:15,334
- You shout at him, did you?
<i>- I drove off, I'm not teaching him again.</i>

541
00:35:15,335 --> 00:35:17,753
- You show him.
- He's rude, he's arrogant,

542
00:35:17,754 --> 00:35:20,547
he's overconfident and he's too street.

543
00:35:20,548 --> 00:35:21,715
You don't like that.

544
00:35:21,716 --> 00:35:24,468
He's been overindulged
and encouraged to express himself.

545
00:35:24,469 --> 00:35:26,470
Express himself! Chop his hands off!

546
00:35:26,471 --> 00:35:28,430
<i>Do you know what it means when they do that?</i>

547
00:35:28,431 --> 00:35:30,265
- Go on.
- How little do they know.

548
00:35:30,266 --> 00:35:31,961
How little do their mothers know.

549
00:35:33,686 --> 00:35:35,713
And they smell.

550
00:35:36,564 --> 00:35:39,338
It's not easy being you, is it? Eh?

551
00:35:50,787 --> 00:35:53,145
Fancy meeting you here, hey?

552
00:35:54,165 --> 00:35:56,654
You don't have to laugh, I'll let you off.

553
00:36:15,436 --> 00:36:17,229
OK, gently, gently, gently, gently.

554
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:18,772
- Steady progression.
- Sorry.

555
00:36:18,773 --> 00:36:20,039
Take your foot off the brake.

556
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,151
There's no need to put
your foot on the brake.

557
00:36:22,152 --> 00:36:24,528
- Do you know what's doing that?
- What is doing that?

558
00:36:24,529 --> 00:36:27,447
- Your boots. Your boots are doing that.
- No, I was taking my time.

559
00:36:27,448 --> 00:36:29,950
- I panicked.
- Your boots, they're inappropriate.

560
00:36:29,951 --> 00:36:31,182
OK, on.

561
00:36:36,249 --> 00:36:38,667
Poppy, come on.
Let's pick up some speed. OK?

562
00:36:38,668 --> 00:36:41,962
- Don't shout at me, Scott.
<i>- Well, don't dilly dally, let'sjust go. OK.</i>

563
00:36:41,963 --> 00:36:44,673
- I'm just learning.
- Next left-hand turn. OK?

564
00:36:44,674 --> 00:36:47,176
- You panic me.
- So, mirror, signal, manoeuvre.

565
00:36:47,177 --> 00:36:49,470
- Gets me right there.
<i>- Enrahah, Enrahah.</i>

566
00:36:49,471 --> 00:36:52,431
Both hands on the wheel, Enrahah. Enrahah.

567
00:36:52,432 --> 00:36:54,391
I don't like that, gives me the creeps.

568
00:36:54,392 --> 00:36:57,853
<i>OK, Poppy. Indicate.
Mirror, signal, manoeuvre.</i>

569
00:36:57,854 --> 00:37:00,022
- Indicate.
<i>- Signal, OK.</i>

570
00:37:00,023 --> 00:37:02,357
- How am I doing?
- Foot down on the brake. Clutch.

571
00:37:02,358 --> 00:37:03,645
You don't want to stall.

572
00:37:03,646 --> 00:37:06,236
OK, find your biting point
and peep and creep.

573
00:37:06,237 --> 00:37:08,238
- First gear. Peep and creep.
- First gear.

574
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:10,895
- Peep and creep.
- Peeping and a-creeping.

575
00:37:18,666 --> 00:37:22,294
- When you get to the end of the road...
- Ooh, he's nice.

576
00:37:22,295 --> 00:37:25,547
When we get to the end of the road...
Can you please focus on the driving?

577
00:37:25,548 --> 00:37:27,716
Enrahah, Enrahah.

578
00:37:27,717 --> 00:37:30,052
- Enrahah. OK!
<i>- I... That's a bit weird.</i>

579
00:37:30,053 --> 00:37:32,346
<i>Foot on the brake, clutch.
You don't want to stall.</i>

580
00:37:32,347 --> 00:37:35,307
<i>Find your bite.
Can you feel you're slightly on a hill?</i>

581
00:37:35,308 --> 00:37:37,226
- No.
- OK, put the hand brake on.

582
00:37:37,227 --> 00:37:40,854
Find your biting point.
OK, lock your door. Lock your door.

583
00:37:40,855 --> 00:37:43,398
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Poppy, there's two of them.

584
00:37:43,399 --> 00:37:45,400
<i>- Are you taking the piss?
- Lock your door.</i>

585
00:37:45,401 --> 00:37:49,238
- OK, let's go. Let's go, Poppy, let's go.
- I don't believe you just said that.

586
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:51,281
Let's go. On you go. On you go.

587
00:37:51,282 --> 00:37:54,451
- Let's go that way.
- Poppy! Poppy, let's go!

588
00:37:54,452 --> 00:37:58,497
- We're on a bend. Now, let's go.
- Blimey, O'Reilly.

589
00:37:58,498 --> 00:38:01,948
Right, on you go. Keep to the left
of the centre of the road.

590
00:38:08,258 --> 00:38:12,719
Usual time next week? 12 o'clock?
You can check it if you like.

591
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,913
See you.

592
00:38:16,182 --> 00:38:18,458
Cheerio.

593
00:38:23,273 --> 00:38:25,465
All right, doggie?

594
00:38:30,238 --> 00:38:32,239
Here's another one.
<i>Yeah.</i>

595
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,491
Circle, completely red.

596
00:38:34,492 --> 00:38:36,118
What? Like a tomato?

597
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:39,246
For instance. White horizontal line.

598
00:38:39,247 --> 00:38:40,914
Give us a clue, Zoe.

599
00:38:40,915 --> 00:38:44,543
Horizontal, parallel to the horizon.

600
00:38:44,544 --> 00:38:45,919
Thank you, Miss Marsh.

601
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:49,464
- You're welcome.
- So, it's not... up and down like a yoyo.

602
00:38:49,465 --> 00:38:51,091
- No.
- Right.

603
00:38:51,092 --> 00:38:52,759
- What is it?
- Vertical.

604
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,262
- No, you muppet, the sign.
- That'd be "no entry".

605
00:38:55,263 --> 00:38:57,723
- For what?
- For black boys on bicycles.

606
00:38:57,724 --> 00:39:00,934
- Don't get me started on that again.
- It just popped out of his mouth.

607
00:39:00,935 --> 00:39:04,938
- You can always get another instructor.
- Yeah, I know. See how it goes, eh?

608
00:39:04,939 --> 00:39:07,649
- Ask me another.
- This is also a red circle.

609
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:09,985
- Yeah.
- Black car - this isn't a racist thing.

610
00:39:09,986 --> 00:39:13,155
- Glad to hear it.
- Next to the black car is a red car.

611
00:39:13,156 --> 00:39:15,908
That's Mr Golly overtaking Noddy.

612
00:39:15,909 --> 00:39:18,202
- Enrahah.
- Enrahah to you.

613
00:39:18,203 --> 00:39:21,079
- What is it?
- No overtaking.

614
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,707
- Enrahah.
- Enrahah-ha-ha!

615
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:26,168
- He sounds like a nutter.
- He is a nutter.

616
00:39:26,169 --> 00:39:29,004
- How's your back?
- It's all right, actually. He sorted it.

617
00:39:29,005 --> 00:39:31,590
Magic fingers. He was sweet, wasn't he?

618
00:39:31,591 --> 00:39:33,784
He was fit.

619
00:39:34,302 --> 00:39:36,637
Octagonal sign with "stop" written in it.

620
00:39:36,638 --> 00:39:38,914
- Stop!
- All right, then.

621
00:39:43,937 --> 00:39:46,129
Who's going to blink first?

622
00:39:55,406 --> 00:39:58,892
- Do you want a cup of tea?
- Yes, please.

623
00:40:00,161 --> 00:40:04,373
No, you have the lasagne tonight.
We can finish the chicken tomorrow.

624
00:40:04,374 --> 00:40:07,325
Look, I can't talk now. See you later.

625
00:40:07,877 --> 00:40:10,337
- Do you think we'll make it?
- Depends on the traffic.

626
00:40:10,338 --> 00:40:14,203
Should be all right. Ooh, that's my back!

627
00:40:31,442 --> 00:40:34,653
Hey, come in, ladies, as quick as you can.

628
00:40:34,654 --> 00:40:37,698
<i>Do want to put your bags,
and there's a couple of places.</i>

629
00:40:37,699 --> 00:40:39,032
- Sorry we're late.
- Sorry.

630
00:40:39,033 --> 00:40:43,203
No problem, it's very Spanish to be late.
Take your places. Then we can start.

631
00:40:43,204 --> 00:40:45,397
Here.

632
00:40:48,001 --> 00:40:51,211
I was just introducing myself
to the peoples what don't know me.

633
00:40:51,212 --> 00:40:54,006
It's lovely to see you again
and lovely you bring a friend.

634
00:40:54,007 --> 00:40:55,841
Welcome in my class.

635
00:40:55,842 --> 00:41:01,346
So, my name is Rositta Santos
and I'm coming from Sevilla in Spain.

636
00:41:01,347 --> 00:41:04,963
Or Seville, what you say here.

637
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:12,566
<i>What is famous for our bullfighting,
our beautiful oranges -</i>

638
00:41:12,567 --> 00:41:18,280
what your English peoples
turn into disgusting marmalade.

639
00:41:18,281 --> 00:41:20,949
<i>Are you going to keep
those sunglasses on, then?</i>

640
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:26,121
And also is the birth home of flamenco.

641
00:41:26,122 --> 00:41:27,900
Sorry.

642
00:41:43,139 --> 00:41:46,459
Then everybody is ready... I hope.

643
00:41:48,144 --> 00:41:51,298
<i>So, feet in parallel. Hip distance apart.</i>

644
00:41:52,148 --> 00:41:56,985
Pulling up from the waist.
Opening across the chest.

645
00:41:56,986 --> 00:42:00,614
<i>Shoulder blades drawing down to the spine.</i>

646
00:42:00,615 --> 00:42:02,808
Arms relaxed.

647
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:07,191
And taking the head over to your right.

648
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:11,695
<i>Feeling that lovely stretch at the neck.</i>

649
00:42:14,879 --> 00:42:16,573
Then to the left.

650
00:42:17,173 --> 00:42:19,366
Not very flamenco, is it?

651
00:42:20,385 --> 00:42:22,542
<i>To the right.</i>

652
00:42:23,012 --> 00:42:25,703
<i>Bringing the head back to the centre.</i>

653
00:42:26,349 --> 00:42:28,542
<i>And relax. Lovely.</i>

654
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:32,354
So, guys.
We're going to reverse the abs now.

655
00:42:32,355 --> 00:42:34,713
Right foot in front.

656
00:42:35,233 --> 00:42:38,610
<i>Lifting up from the elbows
like they got strings attached.</i>

657
00:42:38,611 --> 00:42:40,237
<i>Like little Pinocchio.</i>

658
00:42:40,238 --> 00:42:42,197
Lifting, lifting.

659
00:42:42,198 --> 00:42:44,992
Keeping the shoulders down.
Arms above the head.

660
00:42:44,993 --> 00:42:48,727
<i>Framing the face. Here I am...
proud.</i>

661
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:54,334
Then bringing the arms down in front.
Pressing, pressing, pressing.

662
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:59,298
<i>Keeping the tension,
keeping the strength, but fluid as well.</i>

663
00:42:59,299 --> 00:43:05,220
Then lifting up again from the elbows.
Like the eagle spreading his wings.

664
00:43:05,221 --> 00:43:08,837
<i>Beautiful, angry, ferocious.</i>

665
00:43:10,059 --> 00:43:13,479
And, guys, when you're lifting up
your eagle wings,

666
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:20,110
<i>remember that this dance comes
from the pain, from the suffering</i>

667
00:43:20,111 --> 00:43:21,945
of los gitanos...

668
00:43:21,946 --> 00:43:24,781
erm... what you say, "the gypsies".

669
00:43:24,782 --> 00:43:28,243
I know this word not politically correct,

670
00:43:28,244 --> 00:43:31,997
but these guys,
they been squashed down by society

671
00:43:31,998 --> 00:43:35,584
<i>for centuries, centuries, and they say,</i>

672
00:43:35,585 --> 00:43:38,837
"We don't need this. We got pride.

673
00:43:38,838 --> 00:43:40,797
We got dignity.

674
00:43:40,798 --> 00:43:44,083
We got heart. We got flamenco."

675
00:43:44,761 --> 00:43:49,097
They say, "This... my space."

676
00:43:49,098 --> 00:43:51,266
<i>My space.</i>

677
00:43:51,267 --> 00:43:53,227
My space.

678
00:43:53,228 --> 00:43:56,271
My space. Everybody... do this. One, two.

679
00:43:56,272 --> 00:43:58,232
My space.

680
00:43:58,233 --> 00:44:00,192
- And again.
- My space!

681
00:44:00,193 --> 00:44:02,194
- Vamos! Vamos!
- My space!

682
00:44:02,195 --> 00:44:04,196
- And again.
- My space!

683
00:44:04,197 --> 00:44:06,490
<i>- Vamos, vamos.</i>
- My space!

684
00:44:06,491 --> 00:44:08,450
- With meaning.
- My space!

685
00:44:08,451 --> 00:44:09,660
But, guys.

686
00:44:09,661 --> 00:44:10,828
My space!

687
00:44:10,829 --> 00:44:13,288
- One more time.
- My space!

688
00:44:13,289 --> 00:44:15,833
- With expression.
- My space!

689
00:44:15,834 --> 00:44:18,001
- I don't believe it.
- My space!

690
00:44:18,002 --> 00:44:20,921
<i>OK, guys. I'll give you two counts in.</i>

691
00:44:20,922 --> 00:44:25,008
<i>Then we're going to stamp
and clap the compás, OK?</i>

692
00:44:25,009 --> 00:44:26,490
<i>Uno, dos.</i>

693
00:44:33,268 --> 00:44:37,845
Guys, guys, guys. What are you doing?

694
00:44:38,648 --> 00:44:42,067
Where is the passion? Where is the revenge?
Where is the blood?

695
00:44:42,068 --> 00:44:43,527
This is flamenco.

696
00:44:43,528 --> 00:44:46,655
That clapping, so polite.
It's like the end of the opera.

697
00:44:46,656 --> 00:44:50,391
"Excuse me, how many sugar
you want in your tea?"

698
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:55,164
This woman been spending
every Wednesday afternoon for a year

699
00:44:55,165 --> 00:44:57,666
with your husband, in a hotel in Paddington.

700
00:44:57,667 --> 00:45:01,912
This guy been having an affair
for five years with your best friend.

701
00:45:03,006 --> 00:45:07,176
Your boyfriend, what you gave your love,
your spirit, for five years

702
00:45:07,177 --> 00:45:13,182
betrays you with a Swedish bitch,
what is 22 years old.

703
00:45:13,183 --> 00:45:17,352
You want to kill him.
You want to cut off his balls.

704
00:45:17,353 --> 00:45:22,299
He's such a bastard! I hate him!

705
00:45:22,984 --> 00:45:25,177
Are you all right?

706
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,499
Didn't bargain for that.
That was something else.

707
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,083
I know, but all credit to her.

708
00:45:40,084 --> 00:45:42,336
She picked herself up.
She came straight back.

709
00:45:42,337 --> 00:45:45,214
As if nothing had happened.
Like a little fireball, wasn't she?

710
00:45:45,215 --> 00:45:48,133
- Not a grain of sentimentality.
- No, wipe the tears.

711
00:45:48,134 --> 00:45:49,843
Bless her. I wanted to give her a hug.

712
00:45:49,844 --> 00:45:51,553
I don't think she'd appreciate that.

713
00:45:51,554 --> 00:45:54,431
No! "This is my space, get off me!"

714
00:45:54,432 --> 00:45:57,851
Leaves a nasty taste, though,
exploding her heart all over the floor.

715
00:45:57,852 --> 00:45:59,937
- Then it was "put that away".
- Stick that in a box.

716
00:45:59,938 --> 00:46:01,814
- Get it out another time.
- Perhaps never.

717
00:46:01,815 --> 00:46:03,565
<i>- You'll be lucky.</i>
- I know.

718
00:46:03,566 --> 00:46:06,235
She must be going through some shit,
though, mustn't she?

719
00:46:06,236 --> 00:46:10,614
- She's actually a good teacher.
<i>- Oh, yeah, definitely.</i>

720
00:46:10,615 --> 00:46:12,199
She's going to burn herself out.

721
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:15,410
I believed her when she said
she'd cut off his balls, though. Didn't you?

722
00:46:15,411 --> 00:46:17,871
I don't expect the guys will be back
next week, then?

723
00:46:17,872 --> 00:46:20,444
No! Snip, snip.

724
00:46:21,376 --> 00:46:23,585
- How's your love life?
- How is my love life?

725
00:46:23,586 --> 00:46:25,170
<i>- Nothing doing?</i>
- Not a sausage.

726
00:46:25,171 --> 00:46:27,589
- Are you OK with that?
- Oh, yeah.

727
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:28,966
<i>- Good for you.</i>
- Cheers.

728
00:46:28,967 --> 00:46:31,040
Cheers.

729
00:46:32,595 --> 00:46:35,264
- How's your Beth?
- Darren's dumped her.

730
00:46:35,265 --> 00:46:36,431
Oh, no.

731
00:46:36,432 --> 00:46:38,809
Just before her 18th birthday.
"Thanks, Darren."

732
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:41,019
- Why do men always do that, eh?
<i>- I know.</i>

733
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:44,439
Christmas, Valentine's Day.
Boom! They're gone.

734
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:47,734
- I hope he won't turn up to the party.
- Name off the list.

735
00:46:47,735 --> 00:46:50,779
I'm looking at her and thinking,
"Don't call him. Don't call him."

736
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:53,907
- "Don't do it, Beth. Don't do it."
- You can't say anything, though.

737
00:46:53,908 --> 00:46:57,892
- You've got to let them get on with it.
- You can't help being protective.

738
00:46:58,663 --> 00:47:00,956
Of course, she's got her A levels coming up.

739
00:47:00,957 --> 00:47:03,083
Fingers crossed, she's going to Manchester.

740
00:47:03,084 --> 00:47:05,961
- Fantastic. What she want to do there?
- Sociology.

741
00:47:05,962 --> 00:47:09,173
- Lovely.
- I hope she'll take a gap year. Travel.

742
00:47:09,174 --> 00:47:10,841
That's important, see the world.

743
00:47:10,842 --> 00:47:14,178
- I think so. Cos I never got the chance.
- Nor me.

744
00:47:14,179 --> 00:47:16,472
- You made up for it later, though.
- Didn't I just?

745
00:47:16,473 --> 00:47:18,640
- Where were you?
<i>- All over the place.</i>

746
00:47:18,641 --> 00:47:22,603
Taught in this school in Thailand,
six months. Me and Zoe.

747
00:47:22,604 --> 00:47:26,523
Started off in Australia.
Zoe's got relations in Melbourne and Sydney.

748
00:47:26,524 --> 00:47:31,612
Bali, Java, Malaysia, Vietnam - beautiful.
Then Thailand.

749
00:47:31,613 --> 00:47:33,447
Fabulous.

750
00:47:33,448 --> 00:47:37,784
Amazing. Gorgeous kids.
Loved learning. 60 in a class.

751
00:47:37,785 --> 00:47:39,119
- 60?
<i>- Oh, yeah.</i>

752
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,330
Fantastic. Great challenge.

753
00:47:41,331 --> 00:47:43,290
- And for them.
<i>- Especially for them.</i>

754
00:47:43,291 --> 00:47:44,522
Yeah.

755
00:47:46,836 --> 00:47:49,838
- Do you want another one?
<i>- I'd love to but I'm driving, aren't I?</i>

756
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:52,957
Oh, of course you are.
Got to be good. Work tomorrow.

757
00:48:44,727 --> 00:48:46,728
Poppy, this is your third driving lesson.

758
00:48:46,729 --> 00:48:49,398
- I'm getting quite good, aren't I?
<i>- No, you're not good.</i>

759
00:48:49,399 --> 00:48:51,900
You're smug. You're too easily distracted.

760
00:48:51,901 --> 00:48:55,237
You're distracted by squirrels,
by dogs, by children in the park,

761
00:48:55,238 --> 00:48:58,657
by old ladies in surgical stockings,
by half-naked men in their gardens.

762
00:48:58,658 --> 00:49:02,161
- Oh, well, he was quite fit, wasn't he?
- No, he wasn't fit, he had a paunch.

763
00:49:02,162 --> 00:49:05,914
<i>- I didn't know you were checking it out.</i>
- Keep your eyes focused on the road.

764
00:49:05,915 --> 00:49:09,543
This car is a lethal weapon.
Pay attention or you'll kill somebody.

765
00:49:09,544 --> 00:49:11,503
Keep to the left of the centre of the road.

766
00:49:11,504 --> 00:49:15,424
Oh, come on, Scott. How often do you
see a squirrel sending a text like that?

767
00:49:15,425 --> 00:49:19,511
<i>- Left turn. Mirror, signal, Enrahah.</i>
- Sending a little text.

768
00:49:19,512 --> 00:49:21,254
Enrahah!

769
00:49:24,434 --> 00:49:28,312
I can't believe you're a teacher,
that you're in charge of 40 children.

770
00:49:28,313 --> 00:49:30,564
It took me by surprise,
to be honest. It's 30.

771
00:49:30,565 --> 00:49:32,941
30. You have no respect for order.

772
00:49:32,942 --> 00:49:36,069
You are arrogant, you are disruptive
and you celebrate chaos.

773
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:38,780
- I slipped through the net, didn't I?
<i>- No, you are the net.</i>

774
00:49:38,781 --> 00:49:40,949
Believe you me, Poppy, you are the net.

775
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:44,161
OK, we're going to do the next left turn.
Mirror, signal, manoeuvre.

776
00:49:44,162 --> 00:49:48,248
- Enrahah. Keep with it, Poppy.
- Oooh. Don't like this corner.

777
00:49:48,249 --> 00:49:50,459
Get away from the bend.
Get away from the bend.

778
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:53,629
Do you remember the pyramid?
Do you remember the shape of the pyramid?

779
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:54,796
<i>- Enrahah.</i>
- No.

780
00:49:54,797 --> 00:49:56,965
Enrahah is the eye
at the top of the pyramid.

781
00:49:56,966 --> 00:49:58,634
I'm talking about the bottom of it.

782
00:49:58,635 --> 00:50:01,970
Those at the bottom of the pyramid
are kept in total ignorance

783
00:50:01,971 --> 00:50:04,890
of what those at the top of the pyramid
are achieving. Enrahah.

784
00:50:04,891 --> 00:50:06,308
Where are you on the pyramid?

785
00:50:06,309 --> 00:50:09,353
- I'm outside the pyramid, looking in.
- Of course you are.

786
00:50:09,354 --> 00:50:13,357
Where are you? That is more to the point.
Where are you and your children?

787
00:50:13,358 --> 00:50:16,860
- Where are we all, eh?
<i>- The next left turn. Enrahah.</i>

788
00:50:16,861 --> 00:50:20,239
- Did you like school, Scott?
- I'm afraid it didn't agree with me.

789
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:22,432
Oh, that's a shame.

790
00:50:23,076 --> 00:50:25,828
Let me tell you something
about the education system.

791
00:50:25,829 --> 00:50:29,373
- Oh, go on, then.
- It produces left brain prisoners.

792
00:50:29,374 --> 00:50:31,083
- Do you know what that means?
- I do.

793
00:50:31,084 --> 00:50:33,418
Well, I'll tell you.
Our brain has two sides.

794
00:50:33,419 --> 00:50:37,172
The left brain and the right brain.
The left brain... Keep going, keep going.

795
00:50:37,173 --> 00:50:39,424
The left brain is information, data.
It's dead.

796
00:50:39,425 --> 00:50:42,636
The right brain is individuality.
It's where the soul lies.

797
00:50:42,637 --> 00:50:45,063
And the education system,
it works like this:

798
00:50:45,064 --> 00:50:46,723
"I will give you a world view.

799
00:50:46,724 --> 00:50:50,269
And if you repeat my world view,
if you reconfirm my world view,

800
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:54,273
you will pass your exams and you will
go higher and higher and higher

801
00:50:54,274 --> 00:50:56,859
and you will become a
policeman, a magistrate,

802
00:50:56,860 --> 00:51:01,196
a lawyer, a general, a politician,
and you will be happy and you will succeed.

803
00:51:01,197 --> 00:51:02,865
But if you think for yourself,

804
00:51:02,866 --> 00:51:06,285
if you think outside of the box,
then you will be unhappy and you will fail."

805
00:51:06,286 --> 00:51:11,907
That's how the education system works.
Left turn. Enrahah. Signal. Enrahah.

806
00:51:14,294 --> 00:51:16,154
Were you bullied at school, Scott?

807
00:51:18,548 --> 00:51:21,216
We're going to do the next left turn.
Enrahah.

808
00:51:21,217 --> 00:51:24,039
Kids, they can be cruel, can't they, eh?

809
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:29,249
Nick!

810
00:51:31,895 --> 00:51:35,481
Nick, what's going on? Eh?

811
00:51:35,482 --> 00:51:37,524
Are you all right, Charlie?

812
00:51:37,525 --> 00:51:39,848
Yeah, I could see that. What's going on, eh?

813
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,932
<i>Venga, venga!</i>

814
00:51:47,577 --> 00:51:49,453
<i>Don't bounce.</i>

815
00:51:49,454 --> 00:51:51,445
<i>Keep pounding.</i>

816
00:51:53,208 --> 00:51:55,116
<i>Facing front.</i>

817
00:51:57,212 --> 00:51:59,404
<i>Look in front of us.</i>

818
00:52:01,716 --> 00:52:04,537
<i>It's not salsa. Keep straight.</i>

819
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,140
<i>Venga, mátalo.</i>

820
00:52:10,141 --> 00:52:12,601
<i>Uno, dos, tres. Uno, dos, tres.</i>

821
00:52:12,602 --> 00:52:17,131
<i>Face the front. Don't look at me.
Uno, dos, tres. Keep it pounding.</i>

822
00:52:17,524 --> 00:52:21,472
Uno, dos, tres. Uno, dos, tres.
Uno, dos, tres. Uno, dos, tres.

823
00:52:24,197 --> 00:52:26,354
Bravo, everybody.

824
00:52:26,991 --> 00:52:32,621
I have to tell you, I am slightly impressed.

825
00:52:32,622 --> 00:52:37,459
Much better than last week.
Though of course this is not difficult.

826
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:39,628
And still could improve.

827
00:52:39,629 --> 00:52:41,839
<i>But... it will do.</i>

828
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,328
For now.

829
00:52:44,926 --> 00:52:47,498
<i>Be quiet. Get on with it.</i>

830
00:52:47,971 --> 00:52:51,723
<i>What are you writing about? All about you?</i>

831
00:52:51,724 --> 00:52:53,917
That's lovely, Savannah.

832
00:52:55,353 --> 00:52:58,720
<i>Good girl. Married with a prince, yeah?</i>

833
00:52:59,607 --> 00:53:03,141
There we are. You carry on
with your work, there's a good...

834
00:53:04,571 --> 00:53:07,072
Yeah, you carry on. You draw a picture now.

835
00:53:07,073 --> 00:53:09,491
Hold on. What's going on?
Can you stop that, please?

836
00:53:09,492 --> 00:53:13,524
What is happening? Are you hurting Ayotunde?

837
00:53:14,831 --> 00:53:17,374
Are you all right? He hurt you hard?

838
00:53:17,375 --> 00:53:20,836
He hit you? Come here.
We do not hurt our friends.

839
00:53:20,837 --> 00:53:23,742
You come and sit over here.
Get on with your work.

840
00:53:25,884 --> 00:53:28,886
You were hurting Ayotunde for no reason.
That's not very nice.

841
00:53:28,887 --> 00:53:31,079
That's not what we do to our friends.

842
00:53:32,474 --> 00:53:36,477
- I can't do these.
- Yes, you can. You carry on with that.

843
00:53:36,478 --> 00:53:39,271
- Miss, I've got a tiger fish.
- OK, Chelsea.

844
00:53:39,272 --> 00:53:41,548
What's happening here, eh?

845
00:53:49,532 --> 00:53:52,057
You can talk to me, you know?

846
00:53:53,745 --> 00:53:56,151
<i>Anything you want to say.</i>

847
00:53:57,790 --> 00:54:00,482
I'm here to help you.

848
00:54:08,551 --> 00:54:10,411
Because I'm your mate, aren't I?

849
00:54:13,515 --> 00:54:15,838
- Yes.
- Yeah, that's right.

850
00:54:16,768 --> 00:54:18,960
That's what mates do...

851
00:54:19,979 --> 00:54:21,980
...isn't it?

852
00:54:21,981 --> 00:54:24,388
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Yeah.

853
00:54:30,156 --> 00:54:32,396
What's making you so angry?

854
00:54:37,497 --> 00:54:39,689
I want to help sort this out.

855
00:54:41,584 --> 00:54:43,777
Come on, chop chop.

856
00:54:46,047 --> 00:54:48,240
- Hi, Jenny.
- Hi, Poppy.

857
00:54:50,426 --> 00:54:52,010
- Poppy.
- Have you got a minute?

858
00:54:52,011 --> 00:54:54,054
- What's up?
- I think I might have a problem.

859
00:54:54,055 --> 00:54:56,413
- Come in. Sit yourself down.
- Cheers.

860
00:55:01,229 --> 00:55:03,422
It's Nick, really...

861
00:56:27,471 --> 00:56:29,664
You know what I mean, you know?

862
00:56:30,725 --> 00:56:32,058
You know?

863
00:56:32,059 --> 00:56:34,252
- You know?
- I know.

864
00:56:35,938 --> 00:56:38,231
It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's...

865
00:56:38,232 --> 00:56:39,608
Isn't it just?

866
00:56:39,609 --> 00:56:42,264
<i>You know? You know, it's...</i>

867
00:56:44,405 --> 00:56:47,032
You know, they, they, they, they, they...

868
00:56:47,033 --> 00:56:48,533
Do they?

869
00:56:48,534 --> 00:56:50,952
They're not, they're not,
they're not, they're not!

870
00:56:50,953 --> 00:56:53,538
They're not, you know?

871
00:56:53,539 --> 00:56:55,317
Oh.

872
00:57:09,513 --> 00:57:11,753
Are you warm enough?

873
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:17,062
 I know, I said that I was leaving

874
00:57:17,063 --> 00:57:20,023
- That's nice.
<i>- He's, he's, he's...</i>

875
00:57:20,024 --> 00:57:23,344
<i>- Is he?</i>
- You know, he's...

876
00:57:24,237 --> 00:57:27,224
<i>Ah, now, and he's, he's...
Oh, he's...</i>

877
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:29,683
Oh, no.

878
00:57:30,701 --> 00:57:34,412
He's, he's, he's...

879
00:57:34,413 --> 00:57:36,456
<i>- What is he?</i>
- He's a prick.

880
00:57:36,457 --> 00:57:38,780
Oh! I know a few.

881
00:57:42,171 --> 00:57:44,577
There you go.

882
00:57:45,341 --> 00:57:48,134
That's it. Yeah.

883
00:57:48,135 --> 00:57:50,873
<i>- You know what I mean, you know?</i>
- Yeah, yeah.

884
00:57:51,389 --> 00:57:52,847
<i>She's, she's, she's...</i>

885
00:57:52,848 --> 00:57:55,559
She's, she's, she's, you know.
She's, she's...

886
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:59,604
<i>You know. She's, she's, she's,
she was, she was...</i>

887
00:57:59,605 --> 00:58:03,024
She was, she was, she was, she was...

888
00:58:03,025 --> 00:58:04,776
- She was so...
- Was she?

889
00:58:04,777 --> 00:58:07,696
She wouldn't, you know.
She wouldn't. She wouldn't, you know.

890
00:58:07,697 --> 00:58:10,031
She wouldn't, and I'm, I'm...
I'm not, you know.

891
00:58:10,032 --> 00:58:15,537
I'm not, you know. I'm, I'm...
She's... you know. She's...

892
00:58:15,538 --> 00:58:17,163
She's, you know. She's...

893
00:58:17,164 --> 00:58:20,983
You know, they're,
they're, they're, they're...

894
00:58:21,502 --> 00:58:23,244
You know what I mean?

895
00:58:24,171 --> 00:58:26,198
Yeah.

896
00:58:27,341 --> 00:58:29,368
I do.

897
00:58:30,845 --> 00:58:32,622
What's your name?

898
00:58:33,556 --> 00:58:34,556
Hey?

899
00:58:34,557 --> 00:58:36,975
- Come on.
- Where are you going?

900
00:58:36,976 --> 00:58:39,252
- Taxi!
- That'll be for me.

901
00:58:41,022 --> 00:58:43,214
Come on, 'sake.

902
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:47,193
Keep your hair on.

903
00:58:47,194 --> 00:58:51,558
I've only just met you. Mum warned me
about going with strangers.

904
00:58:54,201 --> 00:58:57,329
- Where are you going?
- Longest way out, shortest way home.

905
00:58:57,330 --> 00:58:59,372
Oh, sod's law.

906
00:58:59,373 --> 00:59:02,064
- Is he gone?
- All right. What?

907
00:59:02,668 --> 00:59:04,861
- Is he gone?
- Ease up.

908
00:59:05,254 --> 00:59:06,880
- What?
- Is he gone?

909
00:59:06,881 --> 00:59:08,256
You what?

910
00:59:08,257 --> 00:59:11,051
- Is he gone?
- Is who gone?

911
00:59:11,052 --> 00:59:13,428
- The rubber knocker man.
- You what?

912
00:59:13,429 --> 00:59:18,558
- The rubber knocker man.
- Oh! The rubber knocker man.

913
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:20,018
- Sssh.
- Why didn't you say?

914
00:59:20,019 --> 00:59:22,812
- Is he gone?
- Yeah, yeah. No, he's gone, he's gone.

915
00:59:22,813 --> 00:59:24,898
- 'Sake.
- I see him. He's a-running.

916
00:59:24,899 --> 00:59:27,388
He's a-rubbing his knockers. He's gone.

917
00:59:28,277 --> 00:59:30,470
Oh, he's gone. Hang about.

918
00:59:34,867 --> 00:59:37,274
Oh, there you go.

919
00:59:38,871 --> 00:59:41,443
Found the en suite, then.

920
00:59:45,670 --> 00:59:47,862
Shake it all about.

921
00:59:54,428 --> 00:59:56,288
What am I doing?

922
01:00:05,731 --> 01:00:07,509
Oh, all done, then?

923
01:00:13,281 --> 01:00:14,975
<i>All right?</i>

924
01:00:31,716 --> 01:00:34,259
Have you had your dinner?

925
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:36,452
No.

926
01:00:48,316 --> 01:00:50,639
- Here you are, take that.
- No.

927
01:00:51,903 --> 01:00:54,510
- Something to eat.
- No, thank you.

928
01:01:03,331 --> 01:01:06,282
- Where are you going to sleep tonight?
- In a bed.

929
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:10,485
Of course you are. Silly me.

930
01:01:20,431 --> 01:01:22,374
What?

931
01:01:36,364 --> 01:01:38,390
You know?

932
01:01:40,910 --> 01:01:42,308
Yeah.

933
01:02:33,671 --> 01:02:35,864
Next, please.

934
01:02:48,644 --> 01:02:50,837
- Are you asleep?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

935
01:03:04,076 --> 01:03:05,819
So what you been up to?

936
01:03:07,496 --> 01:03:09,998
- This and that.
- Ducking and a-diving.

937
01:03:09,999 --> 01:03:11,741
Wheeling and a-dealing.

938
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:14,878
- So where you been?
- Tooing and a-froing.

939
01:03:14,879 --> 01:03:17,321
- Seriously.
- Seriously.

940
01:03:18,633 --> 01:03:20,675
I went for a walk.

941
01:03:20,676 --> 01:03:23,011
<i>Thought we were going out for a drink.</i>

942
01:03:23,012 --> 01:03:25,472
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

943
01:03:25,473 --> 01:03:28,839
- Left you a message.
- My battery died on me.

944
01:03:32,563 --> 01:03:35,774
- So how was your day?
- How was your day?

945
01:03:35,775 --> 01:03:37,967
Fantastic, the earth moved.

946
01:03:39,111 --> 01:03:42,739
- I've got a violent pupil in my flock.
- What's he doing?

947
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:45,700
- Being violent.
- What, is he hitting you?

948
01:03:45,701 --> 01:03:48,662
- He's been hitting the other kids.
- What are you doing about it?

949
01:03:48,663 --> 01:03:50,855
I spoke to Heather.

950
01:03:51,916 --> 01:03:54,108
Poor little bugger.

951
01:03:56,295 --> 01:03:58,588
You've got to love them, haven't you?

952
01:03:58,589 --> 01:04:00,996
Yeah, otherwise you'd kill them.

953
01:04:02,718 --> 01:04:04,511
So where did you go tonight?

954
01:04:04,512 --> 01:04:08,390
The eternal question. Where have we been?
Where are we going?

955
01:04:08,391 --> 01:04:10,583
What's the meaning of life?

956
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:14,354
I went to the moon and then back again.

957
01:04:14,355 --> 01:04:17,524
- Wow, you walk quickly.
- I've got good legs.

958
01:04:17,525 --> 01:04:20,235
Yeah, you've got great legs.
Not that you're my type.

959
01:04:20,236 --> 01:04:24,897
- These are great legs.
- Ah, get off. Read your palm.

960
01:04:27,994 --> 01:04:30,649
Oh, I see a very strong line.

961
01:04:31,163 --> 01:04:36,987
It's your bullshit line,
and I see a tall, dark, handsome... turd.

962
01:04:38,045 --> 01:04:40,797
- Next to it is a bloke.
- A bloke?

963
01:04:40,798 --> 01:04:42,549
- Yeah.
- Let's see.

964
01:04:42,550 --> 01:04:46,344
Oh, yeah, there he is. Isn't he gorgeous?

965
01:04:46,345 --> 01:04:48,538
- Not my type.
- No.

966
01:04:51,893 --> 01:04:54,227
Where have all the good men gone, eh?

967
01:04:54,228 --> 01:04:57,002
Well, they're not hiding in here, are they?

968
01:04:58,566 --> 01:05:02,929
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
We're ready and waiting.

969
01:05:05,781 --> 01:05:07,974
They haven't got the balls.

970
01:05:15,583 --> 01:05:17,417
- All right, Nick?
- Yeah.

971
01:05:17,418 --> 01:05:19,419
- How you doing there?
<i>- I'm reading.</i>

972
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:21,421
- What you reading?
- "Yuck!"

973
01:05:21,422 --> 01:05:24,872
- "Yuck!" That's nice, isn't it?
- Oh, it's a classic, that.

974
01:05:26,177 --> 01:05:28,053
- Nick, this is Tim.
- Hi, Nick.

975
01:05:28,054 --> 01:05:28,803
Hello.

976
01:05:28,804 --> 01:05:31,097
Now, Nick, when I asked you the other day,

977
01:05:31,098 --> 01:05:32,974
did you know what a social worker was,

978
01:05:32,975 --> 01:05:34,684
can you remember what you said?

979
01:05:34,685 --> 01:05:39,898
A social worker helps you on... hard things.

980
01:05:39,899 --> 01:05:42,692
A social worker helps you
with hard things, yes.

981
01:05:42,693 --> 01:05:44,778
- That's true.
- Yeah, very good.

982
01:05:44,779 --> 01:05:46,947
That's right. And I was thinking,

983
01:05:46,948 --> 01:05:50,033
how could I help Tim
to get to know you a bit better?

984
01:05:50,034 --> 01:05:53,662
I was thinking, because you've done
some very good learning this year...

985
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:56,081
Oh, I'd say so, yes.
- He has, hasn't he?

986
01:05:56,082 --> 01:06:00,196
And I was thinking, would you mind
showing Tim some of your work?

987
01:06:01,254 --> 01:06:02,671
- No.
- That's a good idea.

988
01:06:02,672 --> 01:06:04,130
I'd love to see it.

989
01:06:04,131 --> 01:06:06,675
Is that, "No, you don't want to"
or "No, you don't mind"?

990
01:06:06,676 --> 01:06:09,135
- No, I don't mind.
- I didn't think you would.

991
01:06:09,136 --> 01:06:11,638
Well, that's good, isn't it?
What's it going to be?

992
01:06:11,639 --> 01:06:14,099
- You come and sit here. Have a look.
- Oh, thanks.

993
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:17,644
- We should show off your maths.
Are you good at maths, Nick?

994
01:06:17,645 --> 01:06:22,590
- Are you all right, sweet? A bit tired?
- Let's have a look at this. Here.

995
01:06:23,484 --> 01:06:25,485
- What's this, then?
- Look.

996
01:06:25,486 --> 01:06:28,655
- This is last term.
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

997
01:06:28,656 --> 01:06:31,199
Oh, he's good at his numbers.
- Very good.

998
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:33,660
- Yeah, smiley faces.
- I'm going to see you later, OK?

999
01:06:33,661 --> 01:06:36,413
- See you.
- Thanks, Mrs Stockman. See you soon.

1000
01:06:36,414 --> 01:06:40,825
- Smiley face, big smiley face there.
- Smiley face, ticks everywhere.

1001
01:06:41,544 --> 01:06:43,867
- Very good.
- All last term this was.

1002
01:06:44,672 --> 01:06:46,840
Isn't it? Not bad.

1003
01:06:46,841 --> 01:06:48,675
Is it good this term as well?

1004
01:06:48,676 --> 01:06:52,053
Er... yes, it's a bit on and off. Isn't it?

1005
01:06:52,054 --> 01:06:54,514
- Oh, yeah.
- Not so good.

1006
01:06:54,515 --> 01:06:57,123
- We'll get around that, though.
- Of course.

1007
01:06:58,686 --> 01:07:01,555
You know you're not in trouble,
don't you, Nick?

1008
01:07:02,523 --> 01:07:04,107
- Yeah.
<i>Yeah.</i>

1009
01:07:04,108 --> 01:07:07,060
No-one could be angry with you.
Not for long.

1010
01:07:09,530 --> 01:07:11,698
You've been a bit angry,
though, haven't you?

1011
01:07:11,699 --> 01:07:13,524
Yeah.

1012
01:07:14,535 --> 01:07:18,330
<i>- What's made you angry?</i>
- I don't know.

1013
01:07:18,331 --> 01:07:19,956
<i>You don't know?</i>

1014
01:07:19,957 --> 01:07:22,399
What's it like at home?

1015
01:07:22,877 --> 01:07:24,294
Fine.

1016
01:07:24,295 --> 01:07:26,713
<i>- Yeah, with you and your mum?</i>
- Yeah.

1017
01:07:26,714 --> 01:07:27,589
Yeah.

1018
01:07:27,590 --> 01:07:30,079
<i>- You get on with your mum, don't you?
- Yeah.</i>

1019
01:07:31,177 --> 01:07:33,595
- Does anybody else come to the house?
<i>- No.</i>

1020
01:07:33,596 --> 01:07:36,890
No? What about any of Mummy's friends?

1021
01:07:36,891 --> 01:07:39,017
Has she got a boyfriend?

1022
01:07:39,018 --> 01:07:40,760
Yeah, she does.

1023
01:07:41,562 --> 01:07:45,148
<i>She does? What's his name?</i>

1024
01:07:45,149 --> 01:07:46,608
Jason.

1025
01:07:46,609 --> 01:07:48,526
<i>Jason.</i>

1026
01:07:48,527 --> 01:07:50,403
<i>Is Jason nice?</i>

1027
01:07:50,404 --> 01:07:52,229
No.

1028
01:07:58,371 --> 01:08:00,444
Has he been making you angry, Nick?

1029
01:08:01,707 --> 01:08:03,124
Yeah.

1030
01:08:03,125 --> 01:08:04,950
That's no good, is it?

1031
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:10,131
Have you got a piece of paper, Miss Cross?

1032
01:08:10,132 --> 01:08:12,300
Yeah, sure we could rustle one up.

1033
01:08:12,301 --> 01:08:14,678
- You good at drawing, Nick?
- Yeah.

1034
01:08:14,679 --> 01:08:15,993
OK.

1035
01:08:19,433 --> 01:08:22,207
- Here we go.
- Let's get you a pencil.

1036
01:08:22,728 --> 01:08:24,921
There you go.

1037
01:08:25,731 --> 01:08:30,474
Take that, Nick, and what I'd like
you to do, is draw me a house.

1038
01:08:31,571 --> 01:08:32,946
Do you think you can do that?

1039
01:08:32,947 --> 01:08:34,614
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1040
01:08:34,615 --> 01:08:36,559
Thought so.

1041
01:08:38,035 --> 01:08:40,442
<i>That's your mum, in her bedroom.</i>

1042
01:08:40,955 --> 01:08:42,956
<i>- And who else is there?</i>
- Jason.

1043
01:08:42,957 --> 01:08:45,730
<i>Jason's there. Where's he?</i>

1044
01:08:46,544 --> 01:08:49,317
- He's in the living room.
<i>- In the living room.</i>

1045
01:08:50,214 --> 01:08:53,166
<i>- You're all in different rooms, aren't you?</i>
- Mm-hm.

1046
01:08:54,468 --> 01:08:56,994
<i>Why are you in a different room to Jason?</i>

1047
01:08:57,597 --> 01:09:01,224
- Because he's not nice to me.
<i>- He's not nice. What does he do to you?</i>

1048
01:09:01,225 --> 01:09:02,967
He hits me.

1049
01:09:04,061 --> 01:09:06,468
- He hits you.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1050
01:09:07,273 --> 01:09:10,225
<i>You know that's not right, don't you, Nick?</i>

1051
01:09:15,907 --> 01:09:18,199
- It was lovely to meet you.
- Yeah, you too.

1052
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:20,035
Thank you. I think he'll be all right.

1053
01:09:20,036 --> 01:09:21,453
- Of course.
- Yeah.

1054
01:09:21,454 --> 01:09:25,123
- He's got a good teacher.
- Has he? Where is she? I can't see her.

1055
01:09:25,124 --> 01:09:28,001
- I'm looking at her.
- Oh. Thank you very much.

1056
01:09:28,002 --> 01:09:32,005
- I wouldn't mind looking at her again.
- She wouldn't mind looking at you again.

1057
01:09:32,006 --> 01:09:33,673
Really? That's good.

1058
01:09:33,674 --> 01:09:35,926
- Give us your number.
- OK, I'll write it down.

1059
01:09:35,927 --> 01:09:38,119
That's a start.

1060
01:09:45,311 --> 01:09:46,728
There you go.

1061
01:09:46,729 --> 01:09:49,439
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

1062
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:51,633
- Goodbye.
- See you.

1063
01:10:03,621 --> 01:10:05,997
Are you all right? Had a good week?

1064
01:10:05,998 --> 01:10:08,191
- Yeah.
<i>- Oh, that's a bonus.</i>

1065
01:10:10,127 --> 01:10:11,738
Smells in here.

1066
01:10:12,964 --> 01:10:15,548
<i>I didn't know you had a dog.</i>

1067
01:10:15,549 --> 01:10:18,134
No, it isn't a dog. I just had a lesson.

1068
01:10:18,135 --> 01:10:20,624
<i>- Bit stinky, was he?</i>
- Could say that.

1069
01:10:22,974 --> 01:10:25,600
<i>- You got a dog?</i>
- No, I live in a flat.

1070
01:10:25,601 --> 01:10:29,938
Be cruel, wouldn't it? I'd love a dog.
Have you ever had a dog?

1071
01:10:29,939 --> 01:10:32,566
- Your mum and dad got a dog?
- My dad's dead.

1072
01:10:32,567 --> 01:10:34,759
<i>Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.</i>

1073
01:10:35,611 --> 01:10:37,946
- How do you get on with your mum?
<i>- I don't.</i>

1074
01:10:37,947 --> 01:10:39,143
Oh.

1075
01:10:42,410 --> 01:10:43,994
You live with your mum and dad?

1076
01:10:43,995 --> 01:10:45,954
No.

1077
01:10:45,955 --> 01:10:48,693
How old do you think I am, 12?

1078
01:10:49,834 --> 01:10:52,252
- 22, 23?
<i>- Oh, I like you.</i>

1079
01:10:52,253 --> 01:10:54,445
You can stay.

1080
01:10:54,964 --> 01:10:56,673
I'm 30.

1081
01:10:56,674 --> 01:10:58,665
Old maid, now.

1082
01:11:02,305 --> 01:11:04,306
So, do you live on your own?

1083
01:11:04,307 --> 01:11:07,058
No. I live with my flatmate.

1084
01:11:07,059 --> 01:11:11,146
Nearly 10 years now.
She done well, bless her.

1085
01:11:11,147 --> 01:11:15,012
- That's a long time.
- She's gorgeous. I love her.

1086
01:11:17,320 --> 01:11:19,346
What do you mean, you love her?

1087
01:11:19,906 --> 01:11:24,020
I mean, I love her. She loves me.
We love each other.

1088
01:11:28,039 --> 01:11:29,697
What, so you're...

1089
01:11:30,207 --> 01:11:32,281
What?

1090
01:11:36,505 --> 01:11:39,113
Yeah, that's it. That's us.

1091
01:11:43,721 --> 01:11:48,334
- You got a problem with that, Scott?
- No, nothing to do with me.

1092
01:11:50,019 --> 01:11:51,879
I don't think it is.

1093
01:11:55,733 --> 01:11:59,152
- OK, check your mirrors. Enrahah.
- Yeah, checking, checking.

1094
01:11:59,153 --> 01:12:02,072
Indicate and knock on the door,
let them know you want to come in.

1095
01:12:02,073 --> 01:12:05,533
Knock on the door, OK. Put your foot
down on the clutch. Put it in first gear.

1096
01:12:05,534 --> 01:12:08,119
OK, find your biting point
just before you go. OK, stop.

1097
01:12:08,120 --> 01:12:09,871
- What?
- Put the car in neutral.

1098
01:12:09,872 --> 01:12:11,873
Put the car in neutral, the hand brake on.

1099
01:12:11,874 --> 01:12:15,543
Take your hand off the steering wheel,
foot off the pedal, turn off the ignition.

1100
01:12:15,544 --> 01:12:17,504
- I haven't started.
<i>- I've stopped.</i>

1101
01:12:17,505 --> 01:12:20,048
- Now you tell me why I've stopped.
- Got a headache?

1102
01:12:20,049 --> 01:12:23,093
No. Yes! I have got a headache
and you tell me why I've got one.

1103
01:12:23,094 --> 01:12:27,180
Erm... I don't know. Time of the month?
Oh, give me a clue.

1104
01:12:27,181 --> 01:12:29,753
Well, think. Top to toe. Top to toe.

1105
01:12:30,893 --> 01:12:32,686
<i>- Boots, Poppy. Boots.</i>
- Oh, here we go.

1106
01:12:32,687 --> 01:12:35,730
Every week I ask you,
"Please wear appropriate footwear."

1107
01:12:35,731 --> 01:12:38,400
And every week you insist
on wearing those stupid boots.

1108
01:12:38,401 --> 01:12:40,735
- Yeah, sorry about that.
<i>- You know what this is?</i>

1109
01:12:40,736 --> 01:12:42,821
<i>- This is vanity before safety.</i>
- Oh, right.

1110
01:12:42,822 --> 01:12:45,824
"I'm sorry, Mrs Jones. I'm sorry.
Poppy killed your child,

1111
01:12:45,825 --> 01:12:49,160
but don't worry, she looked really cool
in her sexy, seductive boots."

1112
01:12:49,161 --> 01:12:51,204
- Am I keeping you awake at night?
<i>- No.</i>

1113
01:12:51,205 --> 01:12:52,780
Are you sure about that?

1114
01:12:53,583 --> 01:12:55,292
Shall we get on with the lesson?

1115
01:12:55,293 --> 01:12:57,210
Will you do something about your boots?

1116
01:12:57,211 --> 01:13:00,714
I don't think so. They're fine.
I'm comfy in these.

1117
01:13:00,715 --> 01:13:03,121
A lot of people drive in heels.

1118
01:13:03,926 --> 01:13:06,011
Very well, on your head be it.

1119
01:13:06,012 --> 01:13:08,038
Yeah, okey-dokey.

1120
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:19,274
Keep to the left of the centre.
Enrahah. Enrahah.

1121
01:13:19,275 --> 01:13:21,151
When we come to this bend, what do we do?

1122
01:13:21,152 --> 01:13:24,529
- Are you expecting the worst?
<i>- We keep to the left.</i>

1123
01:13:24,530 --> 01:13:26,156
<i>We expect a juggernaut, OK?</i>

1124
01:13:26,157 --> 01:13:28,366
- Expect the worst.
- Expecting the worst.

1125
01:13:28,367 --> 01:13:30,619
- More gas, more gas.
<i>- Expecting the worst.</i>

1126
01:13:30,620 --> 01:13:32,078
- Expecting the worst.
<i>- More gas.</i>

1127
01:13:32,079 --> 01:13:35,373
- There's a juggernaut, get down!
- Poppy, put both hands on the wheel

1128
01:13:35,374 --> 01:13:37,250
and keep your eyes on the road!

1129
01:13:37,251 --> 01:13:40,086
- There was a juggernaut, Scott.
- There wasn't a juggernaut.

1130
01:13:40,087 --> 01:13:42,964
- That was a stupid thing to do, Poppy.
- There was a little...

1131
01:13:42,965 --> 01:13:45,217
- Give me gas. Give me gas.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1132
01:13:45,218 --> 01:13:47,710
- I'm giving you gas.
- Away from the bend. Give me gas.

1133
01:13:54,268 --> 01:13:55,101
Right.

1134
01:13:55,102 --> 01:13:57,020
- Poppy.
<i>- Yeah?</i>

1135
01:13:57,021 --> 01:13:59,773
I am not going to allow you
to endanger both of us,

1136
01:13:59,774 --> 01:14:01,858
just for you to have
your stupid little joke.

1137
01:14:01,859 --> 01:14:05,278
<i>I mean, if you want to make jokes,
if that's what you want to do,</i>

1138
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:08,198
then I will gladly sit here
and you can take the mickey out of me

1139
01:14:08,199 --> 01:14:10,492
for £22.50 an hour - it's your money.

1140
01:14:10,493 --> 01:14:13,578
<i>- I'm big enough. I can take it.</i>
- Can you?

1141
01:14:13,579 --> 01:14:16,706
But I will not allow you
to endanger yourself, myself,

1142
01:14:16,707 --> 01:14:19,251
and other road users
just for your amusement.

1143
01:14:19,252 --> 01:14:20,877
I wasn't taking the mickey, Scott.

1144
01:14:20,878 --> 01:14:23,505
- I'm sorry.
<i>- Don't touch me! Don't you touch me!</i>

1145
01:14:23,506 --> 01:14:26,466
Right, that's it. Get out!

1146
01:14:26,467 --> 01:14:29,177
- What's happening now?
- Get in the passenger seat.

1147
01:14:29,178 --> 01:14:32,545
- Why?
- The lesson is over. I'm taking you home.

1148
01:14:33,933 --> 01:14:37,134
Oh. So, that's that, then, is it?

1149
01:14:37,728 --> 01:14:39,173
<i>All right, then.</i>

1150
01:14:44,944 --> 01:14:49,094
Speak to the office and when they ask you,
tell them I can't teach you.

1151
01:14:54,412 --> 01:14:55,537
Fucking...!

1152
01:14:55,538 --> 01:14:58,608
Take it easy, Scott.
It's all right. It's all right.

1153
01:15:07,049 --> 01:15:11,461
Well, come on, then. Let's go.
It's costing me enough money as it is.

1154
01:15:12,930 --> 01:15:17,080
All I ask is that you behave like an adult.

1155
01:15:18,227 --> 01:15:20,550
What? Like you, Scott?

1156
01:15:26,235 --> 01:15:28,143
It's like musical cars, this.

1157
01:15:29,864 --> 01:15:33,116
- What now?
- Get in the driver's seat, please.

1158
01:15:33,117 --> 01:15:35,274
I've never given up on a pupil.

1159
01:15:36,787 --> 01:15:42,278
Oh, so that bit's over, is it?
Oh, well, make your mind up.

1160
01:15:42,877 --> 01:15:45,921
Do you want to have a walk,
get a breath of fresh air or something?

1161
01:15:45,922 --> 01:15:48,114
No? All right, then.

1162
01:15:55,806 --> 01:15:57,750
Check your mirrors.

1163
01:16:03,105 --> 01:16:07,173
What about that guy you gave up on
the other week, eh?

1164
01:16:08,027 --> 01:16:10,195
He passed his test this morning.

1165
01:16:10,196 --> 01:16:13,698
- Oh, well, that's good.
<i>- He didn't deserve to.</i>

1166
01:16:13,699 --> 01:16:16,201
He was very rude.
He didn't even say thank you.

1167
01:16:16,202 --> 01:16:20,830
I don't know, some people.
Doesn't take much.

1168
01:16:20,831 --> 01:16:23,154
<i>- It'sjust the little things.</i>
- That's right.

1169
01:16:23,918 --> 01:16:25,752
Enrahah.

1170
01:16:25,753 --> 01:16:28,111
Keep to the left of the centre of the road.

1171
01:16:30,007 --> 01:16:32,058
You can make jokes while you're driving,

1172
01:16:32,059 --> 01:16:34,547
but you will crash and
you will die laughing.

1173
01:16:35,763 --> 01:16:38,999
Well, if you're going to go,
it's the best way to go, I suppose.

1174
01:16:41,852 --> 01:16:44,396
- Are you scared of death?
<i>- No, I'm not scared of death.</i>

1175
01:16:44,397 --> 01:16:47,107
I'm scared of dying. That's why I woke up.

1176
01:16:47,108 --> 01:16:49,234
- Oh, when did you wake up?
<i>- A long time ago.</i>

1177
01:16:49,235 --> 01:16:50,735
- Who set the alarm?
<i>- I did.</i>

1178
01:16:50,736 --> 01:16:53,196
- I opened my eyes and I saw.
<i>- And what did you see?</i>

1179
01:16:53,197 --> 01:16:57,200
You can laugh while Rome is burning,
but believe you me, Poppy, it is burning.

1180
01:16:57,201 --> 01:17:01,351
And if you don't wake up,
then you will be burnt to a cinder.

1181
01:17:02,999 --> 01:17:06,668
<i>I mean, look around you. What do you see?
Do you see happiness?</i>

1182
01:17:06,669 --> 01:17:10,422
Do you see a policy of bringing
happiness to people? No. No.

1183
01:17:10,423 --> 01:17:12,340
You see ignorance and fear.

1184
01:17:12,341 --> 01:17:15,302
You see... You see the disease
of multiculturalism,

1185
01:17:15,303 --> 01:17:17,012
and what is multiculturalism?

1186
01:17:17,013 --> 01:17:19,347
Multiculturalism is non-culturalism.

1187
01:17:19,348 --> 01:17:21,266
And why do they want non-culturalism?

1188
01:17:21,267 --> 01:17:23,852
Because they want to reduce collective will.

1189
01:17:23,853 --> 01:17:25,520
The American Dream never happened.

1190
01:17:25,521 --> 01:17:27,480
The American nightmare is already here.

1191
01:17:27,481 --> 01:17:29,024
Look at the Washington Monument.

1192
01:17:29,025 --> 01:17:32,861
It is 555 feet above the ground
and 111 feet below the ground.

1193
01:17:32,862 --> 01:17:36,907
555 plus 111 is 666.

1194
01:17:36,908 --> 01:17:40,062
666, Poppy. 666.

1195
01:17:44,624 --> 01:17:47,042
<i>Keep to the left of the centre of the road.</i>

1196
01:17:47,043 --> 01:17:49,816
Are you an only child, Scott?

1197
01:17:53,507 --> 01:17:57,302
Enrahah. Use all your mirrors.

1198
01:17:57,303 --> 01:17:59,496
Watch your speed.

1199
01:18:18,574 --> 01:18:20,150
Same time next week?

1200
01:18:21,327 --> 01:18:23,816
- Of course.
- Of course.

1201
01:18:28,042 --> 01:18:29,617
Stay happy.

1202
01:18:47,186 --> 01:18:50,689
- Oh, come on, Suzy.
- Don't worry, she'll be here.

1203
01:18:50,690 --> 01:18:52,732
What time's Helen expecting us?

1204
01:18:52,733 --> 01:18:56,027
- She wanted us there by four.
- She's going to go nuts.

1205
01:18:56,028 --> 01:18:59,239
Not much I can do about that.
Runs in the family.

1206
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:01,064
How was your lesson?

1207
01:19:02,201 --> 01:19:05,328
I don't know. Dark.

1208
01:19:05,329 --> 01:19:09,147
- How do you mean, dark?
- Dark as the night.

1209
01:19:09,625 --> 01:19:12,544
He hasn't been feeling you up, has he?

1210
01:19:12,545 --> 01:19:14,504
I'd like to see him try.

1211
01:19:14,505 --> 01:19:17,716
<i>Touching your knee instead of
the gear stick, that old chestnut.</i>

1212
01:19:17,717 --> 01:19:19,551
No.

1213
01:19:19,552 --> 01:19:21,910
You all right, Poppy?

1214
01:19:23,347 --> 01:19:26,141
Yeah. I think I'm just worried about Helen.

1215
01:19:26,142 --> 01:19:28,560
Really, how do you mean?

1216
01:19:28,561 --> 01:19:31,479
- Should have gone to see her ages ago.
- Yeah, families, eh?

1217
01:19:31,480 --> 01:19:33,424
<i>Oh, here's Suzy.</i>

1218
01:20:34,794 --> 01:20:36,737
Here we are.

1219
01:20:48,808 --> 01:20:51,017
- Hello!
- Are you all right?

1220
01:20:51,018 --> 01:20:54,219
Look at this! Oh, mind the tree.

1221
01:20:55,398 --> 01:20:57,399
- It's nice to stand up.
- All right, Poppy?

1222
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:00,402
- All right, Jamie?
<i>- Suzy, mind your sister's new motor.</i>

1223
01:21:00,403 --> 01:21:02,279
<i>- You all right, Jamie?</i>
- All right?

1224
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:04,239
- Yeah.
- Long time no see.

1225
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:06,658
- Yeah, long time no see.
- All right, Suzy?

1226
01:21:06,659 --> 01:21:08,702
<i>- All right, Jamie?
- All right.</i>

1227
01:21:08,703 --> 01:21:11,246
Ooh, these are for you.

1228
01:21:11,247 --> 01:21:16,084
- I got you a little bottle of bubbly.
- Oh, thank you very much. It's lovely.

1229
01:21:16,085 --> 01:21:18,257
All right. I'll pop these upstairs for you.

1230
01:21:18,258 --> 01:21:20,255
Lovely, Jamie. Thank you very much.

1231
01:21:20,256 --> 01:21:23,216
- Isn't that lovely?
- I'm guessing we're having a barbecue.

1232
01:21:23,217 --> 01:21:25,410
Whatever gave you that idea, Suze?

1233
01:21:27,013 --> 01:21:28,638
- Keep on running, Jamie.
- Yeah.

1234
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:32,017
Better put these down now, shall I?
That's a good idea. Having fun yet?

1235
01:21:32,018 --> 01:21:33,935
- Yeah.
<i>- Take your shoes off, Suzy.</i>

1236
01:21:33,936 --> 01:21:35,937
- All right!
<i>- And you too, Poppy.</i>

1237
01:21:35,938 --> 01:21:38,940
I'll give you the grand tour.
This is the downstairs toilet.

1238
01:21:38,941 --> 01:21:41,276
- Oh, I thought it was the wine cellar.
- I wish.

1239
01:21:41,277 --> 01:21:44,112
Through here, this is the living room.

1240
01:21:44,113 --> 01:21:47,616
Ta-da! Yeah, went with
a blue and silver theme in here.

1241
01:21:47,617 --> 01:21:49,784
Did you, Jamie?
It's very nice, isn't it, Suze?

1242
01:21:49,785 --> 01:21:51,870
- Here's our dining area.
- Lovely.

1243
01:21:51,871 --> 01:21:55,206
There's usually another chair here.
But we put it outside for later.

1244
01:21:55,207 --> 01:21:56,541
- For the foxes?
- Yeah!

1245
01:21:56,542 --> 01:21:59,252
- We only got it last weekend, didn't we?
- Yeah, flat pack.

1246
01:21:59,253 --> 01:22:00,568
Really?

1247
01:22:03,382 --> 01:22:07,677
It's beautiful, Helen.
Haven't you got green fingers, eh?

1248
01:22:07,678 --> 01:22:09,930
<i>- Is it all right to smoke, Helen?</i>
- I suppose so.

1249
01:22:09,931 --> 01:22:12,140
Can you get the ash in the ashtray, please?

1250
01:22:12,141 --> 01:22:13,767
<i>I'll try not to miss the potty.</i>

1251
01:22:13,768 --> 01:22:15,936
- You've been trained.
<i>- Come and see my roses!</i>

1252
01:22:15,937 --> 01:22:19,064
- Oh, lovely.
- I only planted these this time last year.

1253
01:22:19,065 --> 01:22:21,358
- You didn't.
- They've done really well.

1254
01:22:21,359 --> 01:22:23,485
I want to grow them into a big bush.

1255
01:22:23,486 --> 01:22:25,320
- They smell lovely.
- Don't they just.

1256
01:22:25,321 --> 01:22:27,155
My lavender. Put that by the compost.

1257
01:22:27,156 --> 01:22:30,825
- Best place for it, really.
- Hydrangeas need perking up a bit.

1258
01:22:30,826 --> 01:22:32,494
Bit down in the dumps, is he?

1259
01:22:32,495 --> 01:22:34,996
Hello there, cheer up. Might never happen.

1260
01:22:34,997 --> 01:22:37,791
Busy Lizzies are doing very well.
Beautiful flowers.

1261
01:22:37,792 --> 01:22:40,835
- Been a bit busy, has she?
- Going to plant more of these next year.

1262
01:22:40,836 --> 01:22:42,963
- That looks crap.
- Thanks, Suzy.

1263
01:22:42,964 --> 01:22:44,965
- Eucalyptus.
- Oh, Zoe.

1264
01:22:44,966 --> 01:22:46,967
Gum tree!

1265
01:22:46,968 --> 01:22:49,553
- Brings back memories, doesn't it?
- Yeah, the smell.

1266
01:22:49,554 --> 01:22:51,346
G'day, blue, how's it going?

1267
01:22:51,347 --> 01:22:54,307
- Drinks up.
- Cheers, Jamie. Let me give you a hand.

1268
01:22:54,308 --> 01:22:57,130
- Cheers, everyone.
- Cheers.

1269
01:22:59,355 --> 01:23:00,939
So, you've spoken to Mum, then?

1270
01:23:00,940 --> 01:23:03,316
Yeah, I spoke to her last Sunday.
She's all right.

1271
01:23:03,317 --> 01:23:05,402
- Lovely. She coming down?
- Yes.

1272
01:23:05,403 --> 01:23:07,362
What's she coming down with? Syphilis?

1273
01:23:07,363 --> 01:23:09,990
- When did you last speak to her, Suzy?
- Oh, leave it out.

1274
01:23:09,991 --> 01:23:12,033
- You should give her a ring.
- I spoke to her.

1275
01:23:12,034 --> 01:23:13,910
- They're very excited.
- Course they are.

1276
01:23:13,911 --> 01:23:15,579
They'll come down when the baby's born.

1277
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:19,165
- Get on with the in-laws, do you, Jamie?
- Yeah, I do, as it goes.

1278
01:23:19,166 --> 01:23:22,544
- Yeah, you get on with Dad, don't you?
- We have a nice chat from time to time.

1279
01:23:22,545 --> 01:23:24,713
- Do you?
- That's more than we ever do.

1280
01:23:24,714 --> 01:23:27,340
Does it seem funny,
your little sister having a baby?

1281
01:23:27,341 --> 01:23:30,135
- Yeah, it is a bit weird.
- No, it's perfectly natural.

1282
01:23:30,136 --> 01:23:32,345
- I'm an auntie.
- Oh, yeah?

1283
01:23:32,346 --> 01:23:35,056
- Got two nieces. My brothers' kids.
- They're lovely.

1284
01:23:35,057 --> 01:23:38,018
- Yeah, well, they're all right.
- Oh, he's kicking.

1285
01:23:38,019 --> 01:23:39,508
Oh, yeah, that's amazing.

1286
01:23:39,509 --> 01:23:42,856
Hello, little man in there.
It's your auntie speaking.

1287
01:23:42,857 --> 01:23:45,901
There's your other auntie here, Auntie Suzy.
Does she want a word?

1288
01:23:45,902 --> 01:23:48,904
- What are you going to call it?
- Yeah, have you chosen a name yet?

1289
01:23:48,905 --> 01:23:51,907
- We weren't going to say, were we?
- We're not telling anyone yet.

1290
01:23:51,908 --> 01:23:54,492
- Go on, your secret's safe with us.
- No, it's bad luck.

1291
01:23:54,493 --> 01:23:55,952
It's Nathan.

1292
01:23:55,953 --> 01:23:58,580
Oops. It's lovely.

1293
01:23:58,581 --> 01:24:00,498
- Nathan?
- Yeah.

1294
01:24:00,499 --> 01:24:03,585
- It's a lovely name, Helen.
- Is there a Nathan in the family?

1295
01:24:03,586 --> 01:24:06,588
- No.
- No, just feels right to us.

1296
01:24:06,589 --> 01:24:08,715
Well, that's the important thing.

1297
01:24:08,716 --> 01:24:11,843
- Nathan Lightfoot.
- Yes, Suzy, Nathan Lightfoot.

1298
01:24:11,844 --> 01:24:13,595
Nathan Lightfoot Esquire.

1299
01:24:13,596 --> 01:24:15,597
- It's boring.
- Take no notice of her.

1300
01:24:15,598 --> 01:24:18,087
- I'm not.
- Cheers. Cheers, Nathan.

1301
01:24:19,185 --> 01:24:22,220
- Let me get you another top up. Suzy?
- Oh, yeah, thanks, Jamie.

1302
01:24:26,525 --> 01:24:29,110
I know, let's have a go on your PlayStation,
Jamie.

1303
01:24:29,111 --> 01:24:30,445
- Yeah.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1304
01:24:30,446 --> 01:24:32,822
- Yeah, I'll start it up.
- No, Jamie.

1305
01:24:32,823 --> 01:24:35,859
- Zoe's favourite, isn't it?
- Yeah, I can't get enough.

1306
01:24:36,744 --> 01:24:39,704
- What games you got?
- Sonic The Hedgehog, Splinter Cell.

1307
01:24:39,705 --> 01:24:41,581
- Cool.
<i>- We can't start with that now.</i>

1308
01:24:41,582 --> 01:24:42,958
- Why not?
- It's too late.

1309
01:24:42,959 --> 01:24:44,584
Is it? What's the time?

1310
01:24:44,585 --> 01:24:46,586
- Oh, five minutes.
<i>- No.</i>

1311
01:24:46,587 --> 01:24:49,047
- Come on, let's play.
<i>- Jamie, I said leave it.</i>

1312
01:24:49,048 --> 01:24:51,049
- All right, lovely.
- Sit down.

1313
01:24:51,050 --> 01:24:53,243
Oh, for fuck sake.

1314
01:25:01,227 --> 01:25:03,645
Bane of my life, PlayStations.

1315
01:25:03,646 --> 01:25:05,730
- Oh, you got one?
- No, the kids at school.

1316
01:25:05,731 --> 01:25:08,191
They're like that
under the desks, aren't they?

1317
01:25:08,192 --> 01:25:10,443
- I always confiscate them in my class.
- Do you?

1318
01:25:10,444 --> 01:25:12,571
- What a surprise.
<i>- They must love that.</i>

1319
01:25:12,572 --> 01:25:16,437
- Well, maybe in the morning, eh?
- Yeah, before we go for a walk.

1320
01:25:17,994 --> 01:25:21,288
It's incredible to think
I'm going to get even bigger.

1321
01:25:21,289 --> 01:25:24,082
- Only 10 more weeks.
- Exciting, strap yourself in.

1322
01:25:24,083 --> 01:25:27,043
Doesn't it make you both feel
a little bit broody, you girls?

1323
01:25:27,044 --> 01:25:30,714
- No, actually. How about you, Zoe?
- Afraid not. With all due respect.

1324
01:25:30,715 --> 01:25:32,674
You want a baby, though, don't you, Poppy?

1325
01:25:32,675 --> 01:25:35,969
- No, thanks. I've just had a kebab.
- I didn't mean that. Eventually.

1326
01:25:35,970 --> 01:25:37,345
Maybe. Who knows?

1327
01:25:37,346 --> 01:25:39,639
At 35, you're considered a high-risk mum.

1328
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:42,893
- Give me a chance, I've just turned 30.
- It's only five years away.

1329
01:25:42,894 --> 01:25:45,645
- You've got to make plans.
- A five-year plan? Like Stalin?

1330
01:25:45,646 --> 01:25:47,528
When are you getting on the property ladder?

1331
01:25:47,529 --> 01:25:48,732
I need a step up first.

1332
01:25:48,733 --> 01:25:51,860
- You got to get yourself a mortgage.
- We don't want the hassle.

1333
01:25:51,861 --> 01:25:55,322
- You need to invest your savings.
- I just stuff mine under the mattress.

1334
01:25:55,323 --> 01:25:58,033
- Have you got a pension yet?
- You got to be joking.

1335
01:25:58,034 --> 01:26:00,911
- Have you got a pension?
- We've both got pensions, haven't we?

1336
01:26:00,912 --> 01:26:03,830
- Oh, yeah.
- Great. Where are your Zimmer frames?

1337
01:26:03,831 --> 01:26:05,999
- You've got to take life seriously.
- Have I?

1338
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,169
You can't get drunk every night, partying,
however much fun it is.

1339
01:26:09,170 --> 01:26:11,296
I don't get drunk every night. Do we?

1340
01:26:11,297 --> 01:26:14,716
- No, she's an adult now, your big sister.
- Unfortunately.

1341
01:26:14,717 --> 01:26:17,594
- You have to take responsibility, Poppy.
- OK, take it easy.

1342
01:26:17,595 --> 01:26:19,804
I am taking it easy.

1343
01:26:19,805 --> 01:26:21,681
I just want you to be happy, that's all.

1344
01:26:21,682 --> 01:26:23,183
I am happy.

1345
01:26:23,184 --> 01:26:24,935
- I don't think you are.
- I am.

1346
01:26:24,936 --> 01:26:27,675
I love my life. Yeah,
it can be tough at times.

1347
01:26:27,676 --> 01:26:29,356
That's part of it, isn't it?

1348
01:26:29,357 --> 01:26:32,495
I've got a great job,
brilliant kids, lovely flat.

1349
01:26:32,496 --> 01:26:34,069
I've got her to look at.

1350
01:26:34,070 --> 01:26:39,032
I've got amazing friends. I love my freedom.
I'm a lucky lady, I know that.

1351
01:26:39,033 --> 01:26:41,785
- All right, no need to rub it in.
- What am I rubbing in?

1352
01:26:41,786 --> 01:26:43,828
- I know what you're saying.
- What?

1353
01:26:43,829 --> 01:26:45,914
- You think I've taken the easy option.
- Hey.

1354
01:26:45,915 --> 01:26:47,540
Hang on, Helen. She didn't say that.

1355
01:26:47,541 --> 01:26:50,210
<i>- It's what she meant.</i>
- No, you're insecure about <i>your</i> life.

1356
01:26:50,211 --> 01:26:52,128
- All right, Suze.
- That's not true.

1357
01:26:52,129 --> 01:26:54,965
- Why are you trying to control everyone?
- I'm not. I'm not.

1358
01:26:54,966 --> 01:26:56,841
- Whatever. You're boring me.
- Leave it out.

1359
01:26:56,842 --> 01:26:59,094
Why are you all attacking me? It's not fair.

1360
01:26:59,095 --> 01:27:03,292
- No-one's attacking you, Helen.
- They're not attacking you, Hel.

1361
01:27:04,892 --> 01:27:06,393
- Blimey.
<i>- It's pathetic.</i>

1362
01:27:06,394 --> 01:27:09,104
- Suzy!
- Sorry.

1363
01:27:09,105 --> 01:27:11,593
<i>- She'll be all right in a minute.</i>
- Yeah.

1364
01:27:13,359 --> 01:27:15,137
It's hormones.

1365
01:27:18,781 --> 01:27:21,139
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1366
01:27:22,910 --> 01:27:27,190
- Do you want to play a game, Jamie?
- Yeah, yeah.

1367
01:27:27,957 --> 01:27:29,791
No, best leave it till the morning.

1368
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:32,627
I think we should all go to bed,
it's getting late.

1369
01:27:32,628 --> 01:27:33,878
All right, then.

1370
01:27:33,879 --> 01:27:36,831
Jamie, go upstairs
and get the bedding for Suzy.

1371
01:27:37,508 --> 01:27:40,468
- You're looking tired, Suzy.
<i>- She always looks like that.</i>

1372
01:27:40,469 --> 01:27:42,304
It's just my face.

1373
01:27:42,305 --> 01:27:44,222
Thanks for the barbecue, Helen. Jamie.

1374
01:27:44,223 --> 01:27:46,474
<i>- Anytime.</i>
- It was gorgeous.

1375
01:27:46,475 --> 01:27:47,475
Thanks.

1376
01:27:47,476 --> 01:27:50,395
<i>We'll go for a walk by the sea tomorrow.
It'll be lovely.</i>

1377
01:27:50,396 --> 01:27:52,007
<i>Be nice.</i>

1378
01:27:57,403 --> 01:27:59,596
Move your arse.

1379
01:28:03,910 --> 01:28:06,102
Flap, flap, flap!

1380
01:28:09,290 --> 01:28:11,833
Careful, Poppy.
I'm worried about you in those shoes.

1381
01:28:11,834 --> 01:28:14,920
- Don't worry. They're not too high.
- Poppy, come off the wall.

1382
01:28:14,921 --> 01:28:17,113
Give us a piggy back?

1383
01:28:25,181 --> 01:28:27,753
Suzy, don't do that. Don't. Stop it.

1384
01:28:38,277 --> 01:28:41,680
You should have told me,
I wouldn't have got on your back.

1385
01:28:52,959 --> 01:28:55,863
I'm all right. How are you? Good weekend?

1386
01:28:57,380 --> 01:28:59,738
Oh, heavy night last night, was it?

1387
01:29:00,925 --> 01:29:03,580
That's what I like to hear. Good boy.

1388
01:29:05,263 --> 01:29:07,722
<i>So, do you fancy going out sometime, then?</i>

1389
01:29:07,723 --> 01:29:11,672
How's Friday looking for you?
Think you can squeeze me in?

1390
01:29:14,981 --> 01:29:17,553
Oh, go on, then. I don't drink.

1391
01:29:18,234 --> 01:29:20,110
But...

1392
01:29:20,111 --> 01:29:22,303
Yeah, maybe just the one.

1393
01:29:22,947 --> 01:29:25,353
Yeah, something like that.

1394
01:29:26,909 --> 01:29:31,403
All right, then.
See you then, then, then, then, then.

1395
01:29:33,624 --> 01:29:37,359
All right. See you, sailor. Bye.

1396
01:30:01,527 --> 01:30:02,557
Scott!

1397
01:30:22,632 --> 01:30:25,038
Suzy, wind your sister's window up.

1398
01:30:52,078 --> 01:30:55,038
What was that all about, then?

1399
01:30:55,039 --> 01:30:57,082
Search me.

1400
01:30:57,083 --> 01:30:58,959
Bit weird.

1401
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:01,152
Isn't it just?

1402
01:31:02,755 --> 01:31:05,528
- Gives me the creeps, to be honest.
- Yeah.

1403
01:31:09,845 --> 01:31:11,596
So, what are we doing for tea, then?

1404
01:31:11,597 --> 01:31:13,807
- Takeaway. What do you reckon?
Chinese?

1405
01:31:13,808 --> 01:31:15,934
Oh, hello, look who's here. Little piglet.

1406
01:31:15,935 --> 01:31:17,227
- Are you paying?
- No.

1407
01:31:17,228 --> 01:31:19,771
- Course she's not.
- Don't worry, we'll take care of it.

1408
01:31:19,772 --> 01:31:21,606
- Mum and Dad.
- Which one am I?

1409
01:31:21,607 --> 01:31:24,109
- Dad, of course.
- I hate being Dad.

1410
01:31:24,110 --> 01:31:27,061
- You love it.
- Oh, get off, Poppy.

1411
01:31:33,077 --> 01:31:35,020
It's a beautiful sky.

1412
01:31:53,139 --> 01:31:54,639
There you go.

1413
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:56,632
Thanks.

1414
01:32:00,146 --> 01:32:02,671
So where were we?

1415
01:32:03,983 --> 01:32:05,692
What brings you here?

1416
01:32:05,693 --> 01:32:08,069
- I met a girl.
- Oh, very nice.

1417
01:32:08,070 --> 01:32:09,863
- Yeah.
- What's she like, then?

1418
01:32:09,864 --> 01:32:11,489
- I can't talk about it.
- Why not?

1419
01:32:11,490 --> 01:32:13,658
- It's a secret.
- I'm good with secrets.

1420
01:32:13,659 --> 01:32:16,995
- It's between me and her, though.
- Oh, fair enough. I won't pry.

1421
01:32:16,996 --> 01:32:19,402
- Who is she?
- I couldn't possibly.

1422
01:32:19,916 --> 01:32:21,907
Trust me.

1423
01:32:23,127 --> 01:32:24,655
She's a teacher.

1424
01:32:25,922 --> 01:32:28,089
- Is she?
- She's gorgeous.

1425
01:32:28,090 --> 01:32:31,208
Oh... I hate her already.

1426
01:32:32,803 --> 01:32:34,711
Haven't you got lovely eyes?

1427
01:32:36,265 --> 01:32:38,391
- Thanks.
- Beautiful colour.

1428
01:32:38,392 --> 01:32:39,768
- Really?
- Yeah.

1429
01:32:39,769 --> 01:32:41,228
Picked them myself.

1430
01:32:41,229 --> 01:32:42,938
- Did you?
- Yeah.

1431
01:32:42,939 --> 01:32:44,564
- Where from?
- Down the market.

1432
01:32:44,565 --> 01:32:46,608
- You're joking me?
- No.

1433
01:32:46,609 --> 01:32:48,944
I'd say you got yourself a bargain there.

1434
01:32:48,945 --> 01:32:52,572
- You've got one as well.
- Have I? Just the one? Which one?

1435
01:32:52,573 --> 01:32:53,949
- That one.
- This one?

1436
01:32:53,950 --> 01:32:55,951
- Particularly lovely, is he?
- He is.

1437
01:32:55,952 --> 01:32:57,577
But don't upset the other one.

1438
01:32:57,578 --> 01:32:59,037
- No, she's all right.
- Is she?

1439
01:32:59,038 --> 01:33:01,081
- Yeah, we've had a chat about it.
- Oh, good.

1440
01:33:01,082 --> 01:33:04,793
Yeah, she's over the worst now.
Yeah, anyway she's got other talents.

1441
01:33:04,794 --> 01:33:05,961
- Has she?
- Yeah.

1442
01:33:05,962 --> 01:33:08,088
- What are they?
- So many.

1443
01:33:08,089 --> 01:33:09,965
- She can juggle.
- Obviously.

1444
01:33:09,966 --> 01:33:13,218
Yeah, goes without saying.
She can wink on demand.

1445
01:33:13,219 --> 01:33:15,043
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

1446
01:33:15,805 --> 01:33:17,764
- Let's see.
- Are you sure?

1447
01:33:17,765 --> 01:33:19,975
- Yeah.
- It's pretty spooky.

1448
01:33:19,976 --> 01:33:22,394
- Go on.
- OK, are you ready?

1449
01:33:22,395 --> 01:33:24,437
Yeah.

1450
01:33:24,438 --> 01:33:26,430
She is good!

1451
01:33:27,233 --> 01:33:29,859
- This one tries to join in.
- Don't let him.

1452
01:33:29,860 --> 01:33:31,695
I won't. Anyway, he's lovely, so...

1453
01:33:31,696 --> 01:33:35,073
- Well, she's lovely, too.
- Don't try and claw your way out of it.

1454
01:33:35,074 --> 01:33:37,183
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

1455
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:39,828
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1456
01:33:39,829 --> 01:33:41,108
Again.

1457
01:33:48,170 --> 01:33:50,114
This is nice.

1458
01:33:52,049 --> 01:33:54,242
It is nice.

1459
01:34:26,834 --> 01:34:29,027
Here we are.

1460
01:34:32,715 --> 01:34:34,549
Wow.

1461
01:34:34,550 --> 01:34:36,760
Welcome to my humble abode.

1462
01:34:36,761 --> 01:34:38,752
Thank you.

1463
01:35:05,456 --> 01:35:07,540
- Aren't you high up?
- Yeah.

1464
01:35:07,541 --> 01:35:11,211
Yeah. What's it like up there?

1465
01:35:11,212 --> 01:35:13,404
Hm. It's OK.

1466
01:35:16,259 --> 01:35:18,451
That's better.

1467
01:35:30,106 --> 01:35:32,983
- I think you must be too hot.
- Yeah, it does feel hot.

1468
01:35:32,984 --> 01:35:34,943
Yeah, I thought so.

1469
01:35:34,944 --> 01:35:37,137
Usually right.

1470
01:35:38,948 --> 01:35:41,950
- Though it's not really my job.
- No, you're very good at it.

1471
01:35:41,951 --> 01:35:44,286
I know.

1472
01:35:44,287 --> 01:35:46,693
Hidden talents.

1473
01:35:49,041 --> 01:35:51,234
Oh, wow.

1474
01:35:52,587 --> 01:35:55,171
Now, that's what I call a bargain.

1475
01:35:55,172 --> 01:35:57,579
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1476
01:36:02,138 --> 01:36:04,710
One, two, three.

1477
01:36:05,975 --> 01:36:07,517
- I'm a bit hot, too.
- Yeah?

1478
01:36:07,518 --> 01:36:08,560
Yeah.

1479
01:36:08,561 --> 01:36:11,813
- Maybe this'll help.
- I think you might be right.

1480
01:36:11,814 --> 01:36:15,650
- What about if this...
- Oh, yeah, and that one. Go on, then.

1481
01:36:15,651 --> 01:36:16,651
OK.

1482
01:36:16,652 --> 01:36:19,770
Ooh, I quite like it like that.

1483
01:36:21,657 --> 01:36:23,055
- Oh!
- Lovely.

1484
01:36:24,994 --> 01:36:27,650
- What's it like in there?
- Oh, not bad.

1485
01:37:17,129 --> 01:37:19,089
I'll go and make that tea.

1486
01:37:19,090 --> 01:37:21,081
Great.

1487
01:37:44,115 --> 01:37:47,909
Going to be late for my lesson.
Hey-ho. There you go.

1488
01:37:47,910 --> 01:37:50,078
- I'll give you a lift.
- Will you?

1489
01:37:50,079 --> 01:37:51,246
- Yeah.
- Oh!

1490
01:37:51,247 --> 01:37:54,124
- Means I keep you for longer.
- Thank you very much.

1491
01:37:54,125 --> 01:37:56,317
It's OK.

1492
01:37:57,420 --> 01:38:00,672
- So when you coming back to school?
- Oh. Next week.

1493
01:38:00,673 --> 01:38:04,634
- I'll see how things go with his mum.
- Yeah, he'll be all right.

1494
01:38:04,635 --> 01:38:06,828
He'll be fine.

1495
01:38:14,478 --> 01:38:16,313
Hello.

1496
01:38:16,314 --> 01:38:17,593
Hi.

1497
01:38:30,870 --> 01:38:34,605
Are you happy... in your life?

1498
01:38:36,292 --> 01:38:39,113
That's a big question.

1499
01:38:40,963 --> 01:38:42,741
Isn't it just?

1500
01:39:08,491 --> 01:39:11,660
- So, you play football, then?
- Yeah, five-a-side every week.

1501
01:39:11,661 --> 01:39:14,120
- Right. Is that indoors or outdoors?
- No, outdoors.

1502
01:39:14,121 --> 01:39:16,164
- Oh, here she is.
- Made it. Just.

1503
01:39:16,165 --> 01:39:20,659
- Why aren't you wearing any jewellery?
- Oh, it's that kind of day.

1504
01:39:21,462 --> 01:39:23,338
So, you doing anything tonight?

1505
01:39:23,339 --> 01:39:25,715
Yeah, it's a mate's 30th.
We're all meeting in a bar.

1506
01:39:25,716 --> 01:39:27,592
- Great.
- What are you two up to?

1507
01:39:27,593 --> 01:39:29,594
- Oh, cinema.
<i>- Yeah, see a film.</i>

1508
01:39:29,595 --> 01:39:31,805
<i>- Popcorn...</i>
- Sit in the dark, hold hands.

1509
01:39:31,806 --> 01:39:33,181
Yeah, no necking.

1510
01:39:33,182 --> 01:39:35,225
She's only saying that cos you're here.

1511
01:39:35,226 --> 01:39:37,018
Normally I'm all over her like a rash.

1512
01:39:37,019 --> 01:39:39,396
- I don't blame you.
- He's a right smoothie.

1513
01:39:39,397 --> 01:39:41,189
Isn't he just?

1514
01:39:41,190 --> 01:39:42,857
- Here he is.
- Nice to meet you.

1515
01:39:42,858 --> 01:39:44,776
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Zoe.

1516
01:39:44,777 --> 01:39:47,183
- Yeah, whatever.
<i>- Have a good time tonight.</i>

1517
01:39:48,573 --> 01:39:50,765
<i>Come on, you.</i>

1518
01:39:52,660 --> 01:39:56,246
Hiya, Scott. This is Tim.
He's coming with us today.

1519
01:39:56,247 --> 01:39:58,404
- Just joking.
- Hi.

1520
01:40:00,084 --> 01:40:02,752
- Ooh, can't win them all.
- Apparently not.

1521
01:40:02,753 --> 01:40:04,379
- See you later.
- I'll call you.

1522
01:40:04,380 --> 01:40:05,714
- Will you?
- Yeah.

1523
01:40:05,715 --> 01:40:07,077
Good.

1524
01:40:21,814 --> 01:40:25,191
What happened on Sunday, Scott?
You should've stopped to say hello.

1525
01:40:25,192 --> 01:40:28,320
I don't know what you're talking about.
I was in Stevenage on Sunday.

1526
01:40:28,321 --> 01:40:30,739
Stevenage? Funny, you must have a twin.

1527
01:40:30,740 --> 01:40:33,617
I was there all day. I was looking after
my mum. My aunt's dying.

1528
01:40:33,618 --> 01:40:36,244
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- It's all right.

1529
01:40:36,245 --> 01:40:40,415
- Don't believe you, Scott.
- It's up to you, I was there till midnight.

1530
01:40:40,416 --> 01:40:42,609
Don't think so, gigolo.

1531
01:41:00,937 --> 01:41:03,730
<i>Concentrate, Poppy.
Concentrate. Watch what I'm doing.</i>

1532
01:41:03,731 --> 01:41:07,651
Now I'm going to indicate. I keep in lane.
In a roundabout, you keep in lane.

1533
01:41:07,652 --> 01:41:09,819
OK? You keep in lane, all right?

1534
01:41:09,820 --> 01:41:14,991
<i>You take responsibility for other drivers
and for yourself and you keep in lane, OK?</i>

1535
01:41:14,992 --> 01:41:17,953
This is a roundabout. Concentrate,
pay attention. Good. Thank you.

1536
01:41:17,954 --> 01:41:20,538
Are you... Was that a request
or was that a demand?

1537
01:41:20,539 --> 01:41:23,124
Did he bully me then?
Did he just shove in then?

1538
01:41:23,125 --> 01:41:24,751
<i>- Or did he ask?</i>
- Did he?

1539
01:41:24,752 --> 01:41:27,337
No, he didn't ask.
You see what roundabouts do?

1540
01:41:27,338 --> 01:41:31,424
Roundabouts, if you keep in lane
and you keep going, you'll be fine.

1541
01:41:31,425 --> 01:41:34,386
You're following rules and keeping
everything the way it should be.

1542
01:41:34,387 --> 01:41:35,679
<i>Everything in check.</i>

1543
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:39,057
<i>But if you get selfish and if you
step out of it, then it goes wrong.</i>

1544
01:41:39,058 --> 01:41:41,796
And it gets dangerous.
Do you see what I mean?

1545
01:41:45,898 --> 01:41:48,817
Waa-aaah...

1546
01:41:48,818 --> 01:41:51,987
I'm not waiting for somebody
who can't keep in lane on a roundabout.

1547
01:41:51,988 --> 01:41:53,488
I'm not waiting.

1548
01:41:53,489 --> 01:41:55,574
<i>Everywhere you see, look at the cameras.</i>

1549
01:41:55,575 --> 01:41:57,993
Everywhere you go, they're watching you.

1550
01:41:57,994 --> 01:42:00,662
They're seeing you. They're watching.
Everywhere you go.

1551
01:42:00,663 --> 01:42:04,082
Look at this place, it stinks.
Come on. What are you waiting for?

1552
01:42:04,083 --> 01:42:07,752
- All right.
<i>- Jesus Christ! Look, another camera...</i>

1553
01:42:07,753 --> 01:42:09,671
Speed camera. Why do you need them?

1554
01:42:09,672 --> 01:42:12,173
There's two guys at the back of the road
selling drugs

1555
01:42:12,174 --> 01:42:15,343
<i>and you have a speed camera.
Why do you need a speed camera?</i>

1556
01:42:15,344 --> 01:42:16,887
You can wait.

1557
01:42:16,888 --> 01:42:18,498
- You can wait!
- Easy.

1558
01:42:23,019 --> 01:42:25,103
<i>Come on! Drive the car.</i>

1559
01:42:25,104 --> 01:42:28,648
You're not driving a camel.
OK? This is not a bazaar.

1560
01:42:28,649 --> 01:42:31,934
We have rules in this country.
We have regulations. Keep to them.

1561
01:42:35,364 --> 01:42:37,557
Fucking morons!

1562
01:42:58,012 --> 01:43:01,056
Check your mirrors, your seat,
make yourself comfortable.

1563
01:43:01,057 --> 01:43:02,849
- No, I don't think so.
- Seat belt on.

1564
01:43:02,850 --> 01:43:04,893
- I'm not going anywhere.
- What do you mean?

1565
01:43:04,894 --> 01:43:06,811
You are in no fit state to take this lesson.

1566
01:43:06,812 --> 01:43:09,064
I am the instructor. You are the pupil.

1567
01:43:09,065 --> 01:43:10,732
- You need to calm down.
- I am calm.

1568
01:43:10,733 --> 01:43:13,568
- You can't drive like this.
- You can't comment on my driving!

1569
01:43:13,569 --> 01:43:17,447
I think I can when you're putting yourself
in danger, putting me in danger,

1570
01:43:17,448 --> 01:43:20,158
- and putting other people in danger.
- It's them.

1571
01:43:20,159 --> 01:43:23,245
That's bullshit. It's all bullshit.
That's it, I don't want it.

1572
01:43:23,246 --> 01:43:25,247
- You want this lesson to stop?
- Yes, I do.

1573
01:43:25,248 --> 01:43:27,916
I don't want you to teach me any more.
I'm sorry.

1574
01:43:27,917 --> 01:43:31,169
OK. Fantastic. Get in the passenger seat
and I'll drive you home.

1575
01:43:31,170 --> 01:43:33,046
No, I don't think so. I'm driving.

1576
01:43:33,047 --> 01:43:34,339
- No, you're not.
- I am.

1577
01:43:34,340 --> 01:43:36,591
Poppy, if this isn't a lesson,
you can't drive.

1578
01:43:36,592 --> 01:43:38,093
You're not driving anywhere.

1579
01:43:38,094 --> 01:43:40,720
You got two choices,
either I drive you home or you walk.

1580
01:43:40,721 --> 01:43:43,098
I don't mind walking,
but you can't drive this car.

1581
01:43:43,099 --> 01:43:46,419
- You can't stop me.
- Yes, I can.

1582
01:43:47,270 --> 01:43:49,396
- Poppy, give me the keys.
- No.

1583
01:43:49,397 --> 01:43:51,982
- Give me the keys to my car.
- No, I don't think so.

1584
01:43:51,983 --> 01:43:55,277
I'm going to ask you one more time.
Please give me the keys to my car.

1585
01:43:55,278 --> 01:43:57,904
- I'm sorry, I can't.
- Give me the fucking keys to my car,

1586
01:43:57,905 --> 01:43:59,447
- you fucking bitch!
- Get off me!

1587
01:43:59,448 --> 01:44:03,827
- Give me the... fuck...
- Get off me. Get off me!

1588
01:44:03,828 --> 01:44:06,621
- Give me the fucking...
- Get off me. You get away from me!

1589
01:44:06,622 --> 01:44:10,125
- Give me the fucking keys!
- You can't touch me, Scott.

1590
01:44:10,126 --> 01:44:13,253
- Give me the fucking keys!
- You can't touch me. You're out of order.

1591
01:44:13,254 --> 01:44:16,298
- Give me those fucking keys!
- You're out of order.

1592
01:44:16,299 --> 01:44:18,008
- You're out of order.
- Give me the...

1593
01:44:18,009 --> 01:44:21,412
I'm calling the police.
Do you want me to call the police?

1594
01:44:22,638 --> 01:44:24,167
Do you?

1595
01:44:27,143 --> 01:44:31,210
Right. So let's just calm down, shall we?

1596
01:44:33,733 --> 01:44:37,302
OK, we're disturbing the peace here.

1597
01:44:41,824 --> 01:44:44,659
I just want to get in my car and drive away.

1598
01:44:44,660 --> 01:44:46,494
- That's not going to happen.
<i>- Jesus!</i>

1599
01:44:46,495 --> 01:44:50,415
You're doing it again. You never give in
for fuck's sake, you fucking bitch!

1600
01:44:50,416 --> 01:44:52,167
- You need help.
- Don't patronise me.

1601
01:44:52,168 --> 01:44:55,795
- I'm not patronising you.
- Yes, you are <i>always</i> patronising me.

1602
01:44:55,796 --> 01:44:58,965
<i>This is what you always wanted,
what you set out to achieve.</i>

1603
01:44:58,966 --> 01:45:00,625
<i>This is the game you play.</i>

1604
01:45:01,135 --> 01:45:04,846
You prodded me. You poked me.
You stroked me. You teased me.

1605
01:45:04,847 --> 01:45:06,973
You flirted with me. You sucked me in.

1606
01:45:06,974 --> 01:45:10,518
<i>You wore your high-heel boots,
your short skirt, your low-cut top</i>

1607
01:45:10,519 --> 01:45:12,812
and you flashed your tits,
you tossed your hair.

1608
01:45:12,813 --> 01:45:15,815
You played with the gear stick.
You lied to me!

1609
01:45:15,816 --> 01:45:20,310
<i>This is all about you.
The world has to revolve around you.</i>

1610
01:45:22,031 --> 01:45:25,742
I'm a driving instructor.
I just wanted to do my job.

1611
01:45:25,743 --> 01:45:28,398
You had no intention
of learning how to drive.

1612
01:45:28,399 --> 01:45:29,955
You had one thing in mind.

1613
01:45:29,956 --> 01:45:34,209
To reel me in. And why?
Because you have to be adored.

1614
01:45:34,210 --> 01:45:37,212
<i>You've got to be wanted.
And you drink it in.</i>

1615
01:45:37,213 --> 01:45:40,006
<i>And you leave me with a spring in your step</i>

1616
01:45:40,007 --> 01:45:43,552
and you go off and you fuck your boyfriend
and you fuck your girlfriend.

1617
01:45:43,553 --> 01:45:47,620
And you all drive around
in that stupid, little yellow car.

1618
01:45:56,524 --> 01:45:58,800
Scott...

1619
01:46:06,659 --> 01:46:08,935
Come on, now.

1620
01:46:17,837 --> 01:46:20,444
I just want to go home.

1621
01:46:22,341 --> 01:46:23,870
<i>I'm sure you do.</i>

1622
01:46:24,927 --> 01:46:27,120
Don't we all, eh?

1623
01:46:33,561 --> 01:46:35,338
Tell you what.

1624
01:46:37,273 --> 01:46:39,881
Why don't we have a talk about it?

1625
01:46:45,948 --> 01:46:48,271
We'll sit in the car.

1626
01:46:48,910 --> 01:46:51,149
We'll have a chat, OK?

1627
01:46:53,205 --> 01:46:55,398
All right?

1628
01:46:58,127 --> 01:47:00,616
And then I'll give you your keys.

1629
01:47:31,494 --> 01:47:33,983
I'm sorry if I upset you, Scott.

1630
01:47:40,002 --> 01:47:42,195
I wish I could make you happy.

1631
01:47:44,257 --> 01:47:46,449
I <i>was</i> happy.

1632
01:47:48,678 --> 01:47:50,455
OK.

1633
01:47:53,224 --> 01:47:55,547
And I was in Stevenage last Sunday.

1634
01:47:57,895 --> 01:48:00,503
- Sure.
<i>- You can ask my mum.</i>

1635
01:48:07,947 --> 01:48:10,389
So, same time next week?

1636
01:48:26,716 --> 01:48:28,873
I'm sorry, Scott.

1637
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:37,424
There you go.

1638
01:48:40,521 --> 01:48:42,548
I'll just get my bag, all right?

1639
01:48:49,989 --> 01:48:52,016
I'm a good driving instructor.

1640
01:48:55,077 --> 01:48:57,685
Yeah, I know you are.

1641
01:49:07,590 --> 01:49:09,165
Take care, Scott.

1642
01:49:10,927 --> 01:49:13,084
Was that your boyfriend?

1643
01:49:17,058 --> 01:49:19,215
Before?

1644
01:49:23,314 --> 01:49:25,305
Was it?

1645
01:52:07,103 --> 01:52:09,479
I think I should give up smoking.

1646
01:52:09,480 --> 01:52:12,107
That's a good idea.

1647
01:52:12,108 --> 01:52:14,300
What can I give up?

1648
01:52:14,819 --> 01:52:17,474
You could give up being too nice.

1649
01:52:18,614 --> 01:52:21,116
Seriously, you can't make everyone happy.

1650
01:52:21,117 --> 01:52:25,314
There's no harm in trying, though, is there?
Bring a smile to the world.

1651
01:52:26,122 --> 01:52:28,895
- Come on, Poppy.
- I know. I know.

1652
01:52:30,126 --> 01:52:32,502
I still think we should call the police.

1653
01:52:32,503 --> 01:52:34,826
No, that's not going to help him, is it?

1654
01:52:35,506 --> 01:52:37,331
I don't know.

1655
01:52:37,717 --> 01:52:39,968
- You know what?
- What?

1656
01:52:39,969 --> 01:52:42,577
- We're lucky, aren't we?
- Yeah, we are.

1657
01:52:43,723 --> 01:52:46,600
Well... well, you make your own luck in life,
don't you?

1658
01:52:46,601 --> 01:52:49,769
Well, some of us do.
Some of us miss the boat completely.

1659
01:52:49,770 --> 01:52:52,063
It's hard work being a grown-up, isn't it?

1660
01:52:52,064 --> 01:52:55,025
Yeah, it is. It's a long trip.

1661
01:52:55,026 --> 01:52:57,218
Yeah, tell me when we get there.

1662
01:52:57,987 --> 01:53:00,559
Don't worry, I'll let you know.

1663
01:53:02,575 --> 01:53:06,453
You keep on rowing and I'll keep on smiling.

1664
01:53:06,454 --> 01:53:08,646
Hm. Are we there yet?

1665
01:53:11,292 --> 01:53:13,485
We've got a hell of a way to go.

1666
01:53:21,469 --> 01:53:24,753
We're getting good at this, aren't we?
Nothing to it.

1667
01:53:36,901 --> 01:53:40,779
Hello, you. Missing me already?

1668
01:53:40,780 --> 01:53:42,948
Oh...

1669
01:53:42,949 --> 01:53:45,188
That's nice to hear.

1670
01:53:46,869 --> 01:53:49,062
A nightmare. Yeah.

1671
01:53:49,705 --> 01:53:52,231
I'm still alive... just.

1672
01:53:53,459 --> 01:53:56,086
Well... it's a long story.

1673
01:53:56,087 --> 01:53:58,588
I'm on the lake, with Zoe.

1674
01:53:58,589 --> 01:54:01,049
Yeah.

1675
01:54:01,050 --> 01:54:03,385
The bathroom flooded, yeah.

1676
01:54:03,386 --> 01:54:05,720
It's all right now. We've found a boat.

1677
01:54:05,721 --> 01:54:09,456
You're funny.

1678
01:54:14,564 --> 01:54:17,136
No.
