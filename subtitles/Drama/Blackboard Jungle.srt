1
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:11,306
Come here! What's the matter?
You wanna be a bum? Come here!

2
00:03:07,537 --> 00:03:10,267
I believe I have an appointment
with the principal.

3
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,965
Name? Name?

4
00:03:13,142 --> 00:03:14,666
Richard Dadier.

5
00:03:14,844 --> 00:03:16,106
Business, please.

6
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:19,544
I've been here before.
It's about the English teacher's job.

7
00:03:19,716 --> 00:03:21,513
- Sit down, please.
- Yes, thank you.

8
00:03:21,684 --> 00:03:23,174
Not at all.

9
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,755
Mr. Dadier, Richard.

10
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,264
Good luck.

11
00:03:40,904 --> 00:03:44,032
- In case anything turns up...
- We'll call you, Mr. Lefkowitz.

12
00:03:46,943 --> 00:03:51,642
- Mr. Dadier?
- Yes, sir. Thank you.

13
00:03:54,284 --> 00:03:56,013
What college did you attend?

14
00:03:56,185 --> 00:03:59,313
Well, I believe it's right there
on the form, isn't it, sir?

15
00:03:59,956 --> 00:04:01,753
But that was an all-girls school.

16
00:04:01,925 --> 00:04:04,860
Yes, well, they took in veterans
after the war, you see.

17
00:04:05,028 --> 00:04:09,590
I believe they still do. With so many of us
coming back all at once, it was a little...

18
00:04:09,766 --> 00:04:11,961
...difficult to find a school or college.

19
00:04:12,135 --> 00:04:14,035
- Veteran, huh?
- Yes, sir. The Navy.

20
00:04:14,203 --> 00:04:15,431
I beg your pardon?

21
00:04:15,605 --> 00:04:18,335
- I was in the...
- You speak very softly.

22
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,306
Can you be heard at the back
of a classroom?

23
00:04:21,477 --> 00:04:26,744
Well, I did some dramatics at college, sir,
and they could always hear me...

24
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,817
...even in the last row.
- Really?

25
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:34,449
- Shall I project a little, sir?
- Go ahead and project.

26
00:04:36,059 --> 00:04:39,961
Once more unto the breach,
dear friends, once more.

27
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:44,388
Or close up the wall
with our English dead.

28
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:51,670
In peace there's nothing so becomes
a man as modest stillness and humility.

29
00:04:51,841 --> 00:04:56,005
But when the blast of war
blows in our ears...

30
00:04:56,179 --> 00:04:59,273
...then imitate the action of the tiger.

31
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:03,647
Very aptly chosen. <i>Henry IV</i>, wasn't it?

32
00:05:05,288 --> 00:05:07,279
It was <i>Henry V</i>, I believe.

33
00:05:07,457 --> 00:05:12,918
Right. Give your credentials to
Miss Brady in the outer office.

34
00:05:13,296 --> 00:05:16,823
- What, you..? You mean I have the job?
- Congratulations.

35
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,228
Oh, thanks.

36
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,995
Try to meet the other teachers
and get acquainted.

37
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:24,162
Organizational meeting in an hour.
Any questions?

38
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,865
No, I... No, sir.

39
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,373
There's just one question, sir.

40
00:05:31,814 --> 00:05:33,577
The discipline problem here. I...

41
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,150
- I beg your pardon?
- Well, I understand...

42
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:42,189
There is no discipline problem in this school,
Mr. Dadier. Not as long as I'm principal.

43
00:05:43,126 --> 00:05:45,287
I see. Thank you, sir.

44
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:54,303
Miss Brady, my credentials.

45
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:56,700
- Mr. Edwards. Joshua.
- Thank you very much.

46
00:05:56,873 --> 00:05:58,465
Not at all.

47
00:05:59,575 --> 00:06:00,837
Shall l..?

48
00:06:08,818 --> 00:06:11,787
Anyway, he says to me,
"Exaggeration, pure exaggeration.

49
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:14,445
There is absolutely no
discipline problem here."

50
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,525
There's no discipline problem
at Alcatraz either.

51
00:06:17,693 --> 00:06:19,422
You can't teach a disorderly mob.

52
00:06:19,595 --> 00:06:22,564
You got to have discipline,
and that means obedience.

53
00:06:22,732 --> 00:06:24,700
- How will you get that?
- With a ruler.

54
00:06:24,867 --> 00:06:28,268
Take a ruler to one of these delinquents,
he'll beat you with it.

55
00:06:28,438 --> 00:06:31,930
- Oh, my name's Murdock. New teacher?
- Yes. English. Richard Dadier.

56
00:06:32,108 --> 00:06:34,906
- Lou Savoldi. Carpentry.
- George Katz. Social science.

57
00:06:35,078 --> 00:06:38,309
I'm taking money under
the false pretense of teaching history.

58
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,678
- Thought you developed their muscles.
- No. Developing my own.

59
00:06:41,851 --> 00:06:44,547
Getting in shape to defend myself
for the fall term.

60
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,588
- Makes it sound like a reform school.
- Oh, first teaching job, eh?

61
00:06:48,758 --> 00:06:51,352
- That's right.
- Don't listen to him, he's a cynic.

62
00:06:51,527 --> 00:06:54,758
Why not? This is the garbage can
of the educational system.

63
00:06:54,931 --> 00:06:57,764
You put these schools
together and what have you got?

64
00:06:57,934 --> 00:07:01,233
One big, fat, overflowing garbage can.

65
00:07:01,404 --> 00:07:06,364
- Think of teaching in an all-girls school.
- Think of those 20-year jail sentences.

66
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:08,032
Got any tips for a rookie?

67
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:13,080
Two. Don't be a hero
and never turn your back on the class.

68
00:07:13,249 --> 00:07:17,845
- Manners.
- Huh?

69
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,784
- How long have you been teaching here?
- Oh, 12 years.

70
00:07:20,957 --> 00:07:23,687
Two purple hearts and no salary increase.

71
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,522
They hire fools like us
with college degrees...

72
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,790
...to sit on that garbage can,
keep them in school.

73
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:34,335
So women, for a few hours a day, can walk
around the city without getting attacked.

74
00:07:34,504 --> 00:07:36,631
Really?

75
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,067
I mean, there must be some students
who wanna learn.

76
00:07:43,112 --> 00:07:45,171
You gonna teach them in that outfit?

77
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:49,443
Because if those kids ever get a look at...

78
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:53,919
Have you arranged with the National Guard
to escort you to class every day?

79
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:58,049
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention please.

80
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,923
Your principal, Mr. Warneke.

81
00:08:01,097 --> 00:08:06,057
Welcome. Welcome to the old faces.
Welcome to the new faces.

82
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,463
Miss Panucci.

83
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:12,264
Say, these kids, they can't
all be bad, can they?

84
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:15,137
No? Why?

85
00:08:22,518 --> 00:08:24,884
Makes you feel good, doesn't it?

86
00:08:25,054 --> 00:08:30,583
Oh, it's funny. I didn't think it would affect
me this way. After all, it's only a job...

87
00:08:30,793 --> 00:08:35,093
...but when I stepped in my own classroom,
it was like reaching a goal of a kind.

88
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:37,755
- I don't believe I got your name.
- Josh Edwards.

89
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:41,131
- How are you, sir?
- Two first names, like Harry James.

90
00:08:41,304 --> 00:08:42,532
Do you like swing?

91
00:08:42,705 --> 00:08:46,402
- Yeah, well, most of it.
- I've got a really fine collection.

92
00:08:47,343 --> 00:08:49,675
I can't remember ever being so excited.

93
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:53,571
It'll pass. You wait till Monday.

94
00:08:53,749 --> 00:08:56,343
The way some of the teachers
were talking...

95
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:59,511
...you don't really expect
any trouble, do you?

96
00:08:59,689 --> 00:09:03,750
- I mean, I figure you can handle any kid if...
- lf you can handle them.

97
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:27,411
How's the most beautiful wife
in the whole world, huh?

98
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:33,044
Hot. Tired. I don't feel very much
like anything, especially not attractive.

99
00:09:33,222 --> 00:09:37,249
- I just feel four months pregnant.
- Beautifully pregnant.

100
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,052
- Champagne.
- Yep.

101
00:09:40,229 --> 00:09:42,789
- And ravioli.
- That's not all.

102
00:09:42,965 --> 00:09:48,870
Oh, you got the job. Oh, darling.
Congratulations, professor.

103
00:09:49,038 --> 00:09:50,835
You want some cheese?

104
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:54,909
Oh, champagne and ravioli. Now,
that's no way to feed an unborn child.

105
00:09:55,077 --> 00:09:58,205
Well, champagne, that's for the mother.

106
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,080
That's for luck.

107
00:10:00,249 --> 00:10:03,912
I've had luck from the very
first moment we met, Anne.

108
00:10:07,456 --> 00:10:10,220
What? Is something wrong?
What's the matter, dear?

109
00:10:10,393 --> 00:10:11,758
Nothing.

110
00:10:13,329 --> 00:10:16,662
Now, look, honey.
It's all gonna be over real soon.

111
00:10:16,832 --> 00:10:21,701
No, no, it's not that. It's just that I don't
wanna let you down again, that's all.

112
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,805
You've never let me down, ever.

113
00:10:23,973 --> 00:10:26,134
I don't know what happened
the last time.

114
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:29,642
Now, look, it's not your fault.
Now, a lot of women...

115
00:10:29,812 --> 00:10:33,373
...they lose babies. And after all, it was...
It was only two months.

116
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:39,010
I know. I can't help thinking about it. I just
don't want anything to happen this time.

117
00:10:39,188 --> 00:10:41,179
Nothing's going to happen, now.

118
00:10:41,357 --> 00:10:44,622
It's gonna be 7 and a half pounds
in weight. It's gonna...

119
00:10:44,794 --> 00:10:48,992
...have your looks and my brains,
and it's gonna support us in our old age.

120
00:10:49,165 --> 00:10:53,192
The most important thing is, darling,
you mustn't worry now. Please.

121
00:10:53,369 --> 00:10:57,897
No bad memories, huh?
No guilty feelings, please. Please, Anne.

122
00:10:59,342 --> 00:11:04,279
And you don't mind my being this way?

123
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:08,648
How could I mind?
I'm responsible, aren't I?

124
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:15,655
- To the three of us.
- To the three of us.

125
00:11:31,907 --> 00:11:33,807
You all right?

126
00:11:34,143 --> 00:11:37,909
- What happened?
- Some crazy kids. That's what happened.

127
00:12:16,085 --> 00:12:18,417
- Good morning.
- Morning.

128
00:12:18,587 --> 00:12:21,920
Last time I felt like this was
when we hit the beach at Salerno.

129
00:12:22,091 --> 00:12:24,525
- At least they're not shooting at us.
- Not yet.

130
00:12:24,693 --> 00:12:26,524
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

131
00:12:26,695 --> 00:12:28,390
How do you do?

132
00:12:28,564 --> 00:12:32,022
- Do I look all right?
- Ravishing.

133
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:35,659
I'm really very nervous.
Do you think they'll like me?

134
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,636
They may even fight over you.

135
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:45,803
- Hi! I thought you said you weren't coming.
- Testing. Testing.

136
00:12:46,382 --> 00:12:49,351
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

137
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:52,009
Hey, lookit. He knows
how to count up to four.

138
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:56,249
Sure, man. He graduated
from this school, didn't he?

139
00:13:02,998 --> 00:13:04,932
Shut up.

140
00:13:06,969 --> 00:13:09,938
All right. That's enough stupid nonsense.

141
00:13:10,105 --> 00:13:13,268
Next guy opens his trap
knows what happens.

142
00:13:13,442 --> 00:13:14,909
Who's that?

143
00:13:15,077 --> 00:13:18,046
He teaches public speaking
or something. I don't know.

144
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:22,378
You already said hello, so cut the yakity,
and we'll get down to business.

145
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:26,214
First, in the name of your principal,
Mr. Warneke...

146
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:29,653
...I wanna welcome you back
to North Manual.

147
00:13:29,825 --> 00:13:34,353
Now, without further ado, we'll have the
teachers call out the roll of their classes.

148
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:38,430
When you hear your named called out,
you fall out to the center aisle.

149
00:13:38,934 --> 00:13:44,065
The first guy gives trouble
gets trouble right back.

150
00:13:45,174 --> 00:13:50,237
We start with the seniors. And because
we're gentlemen, the ladies come first.

151
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:53,973
We got a new teacher here.
She's gonna take care of you senior boys.

152
00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:56,276
Miss Hammond, please.

153
00:14:28,384 --> 00:14:29,976
Miss Hammond.

154
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,754
Frank.

155
00:14:36,492 --> 00:14:39,928
- Frank Adams.
- Hey, lucky old me.

156
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,637
Shut up.

157
00:14:54,076 --> 00:14:59,571
Edward Alpina, Donald Beck, Samuel
Barstow, Harry Cohen, Leroy Croth.

158
00:14:59,848 --> 00:15:01,839
All right, this way.

159
00:15:02,017 --> 00:15:05,418
Up those stairs down there.
There'll be no talking on the way up.

160
00:15:05,588 --> 00:15:08,022
Teach, what'd Mr. Halloran
say your name was?

161
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:11,523
- I said there'd be no talking.
- Dig this cat. He's playing hard.

162
00:15:11,694 --> 00:15:13,787
- He's a big man.
- Get back in line.

163
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:19,626
All right, hold it. You, you.

164
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:24,528
What's the matter?
What's the matter, boy?

165
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,706
- Hey, you. You!
- Me?

166
00:15:34,883 --> 00:15:36,942
- Yes. What's your name?
- Why? What..?

167
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:39,519
- What's your name?
- Why are you picking on me?

168
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:43,920
- I'm not. I'm asking your name.
- You never heard of Artie West, teach?

169
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:47,662
I want you to monitor this class.
Write down the names...

170
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,821
...of anybody who talks.
- Talks about?

171
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:52,763
- They open their mouth, write their name.
- No pencil.

172
00:15:52,935 --> 00:15:54,459
- I've got a pencil.
- No paper.

173
00:15:54,637 --> 00:15:57,572
Just take it. Will you take it?
Look out for a minute.

174
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,607
- What'd you make the kid cry for?
- Wasn't my fault.

175
00:16:00,776 --> 00:16:02,801
Heads. Chiggee.

176
00:16:03,646 --> 00:16:06,513
Hold it. Just hold it.

177
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:10,313
What is this? The officers' club
or something?

178
00:16:10,486 --> 00:16:14,513
I don't wanna catch you smoking in here
again, you understand? Now get out.

179
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:17,420
Come on, you heard what I said. Get out.

180
00:16:20,996 --> 00:16:23,692
What's the matter? You guys
privileged or something?

181
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:27,927
- We only just got here, chief.
- You did, huh? Well, now just get out.

182
00:16:28,103 --> 00:16:31,630
- Can't a man wash his hands, chief?
- Wash them and get out.

183
00:16:31,807 --> 00:16:36,107
- Sure, chief. You gonna watch me?
- Maybe he'd like to wash them for us.

184
00:16:36,278 --> 00:16:40,078
What's your name?
You, I'm talking to you.

185
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,682
- Me?
- Yes, you.

186
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,181
- Emmanuel.
- Emmanuel what?

187
00:16:43,352 --> 00:16:47,516
Emmanuel Trades. Don't you know, man?
This boy got the school named after him.

188
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:59,128
- What's your name, wise guy?
- Me? Miller. Gregory Miller.

189
00:16:59,301 --> 00:17:01,792
You want me to spell it out
so you won't forget?

190
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:04,131
You don't have to. I'll remember, Miller.

191
00:17:04,306 --> 00:17:05,796
Sure, chief. You do that.

192
00:17:05,974 --> 00:17:08,636
Maybe you'd like to walk
to the principal's office.

193
00:17:08,811 --> 00:17:11,405
- Is that what you want?
- You're holding the cards.

194
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,777
You wanna take me to see Mr. Warneke,
you'll do just that.

195
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,180
Who's your home-period teacher?

196
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:21,679
You are, chief.

197
00:17:22,825 --> 00:17:24,986
Why aren't you with the rest
of the class?

198
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,062
Already told you.
Came in to wash up, chief.

199
00:17:29,231 --> 00:17:32,723
All right, wash up. Just cut out
that "chief" routine, understand?

200
00:17:32,901 --> 00:17:39,170
Sure, chief. That's what I been doing all
the time. Okay for us to drift now, chief?

201
00:17:39,341 --> 00:17:43,004
- I don't wanna catch you here again.
- Suppose I got business here?

202
00:17:43,178 --> 00:17:47,911
Look, how many times do I have to tell you?
Let's go, huh? Come on, let's go.

203
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:55,389
- Let's go, bright boy.
- Hey, he means me.

204
00:18:15,711 --> 00:18:20,205
All right, sit anywhere.
We'll arrange permanent seating later.

205
00:18:20,382 --> 00:18:23,044
You wanna close the door
for me there? Thank you.

206
00:18:23,218 --> 00:18:25,584
Hey, how about that Miss Hammond?

207
00:18:25,754 --> 00:18:28,279
All right, let's break it up back there.

208
00:18:30,459 --> 00:18:33,758
- Hear what I said? I said, break it up.
- Why?

209
00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:40,865
- What'd you say?
- I said, why?

210
00:18:41,904 --> 00:18:43,633
Sit down.

211
00:18:49,144 --> 00:18:51,806
First thing we're gonna do
is pass these cards out.

212
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,675
Take one and pass the rest back.

213
00:18:53,849 --> 00:18:58,479
Number of this class is 55,
number of the classroom is 206.

214
00:18:59,321 --> 00:19:00,720
My name is spelled...

215
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:04,757
...D-A-D...

216
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,290
...I-E-R.

217
00:19:09,798 --> 00:19:11,698
Now, that's pronounced "Da-dee..."

218
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:45,828
Whoever threw that, you'll never pitch
for the Yanks, boy.

219
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:51,471
Hey, Artie. How do you like Mr. Daddy-oh?

220
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,801
- Daddy-oh.
- Daddy-oh!

221
00:19:53,976 --> 00:19:59,608
<i>Daddy-oh! Daddy-oh! Daddy-oh!</i>

222
00:20:00,816 --> 00:20:02,909
You all finished?

223
00:20:03,085 --> 00:20:06,418
Fine. Glad you got that out
of your system.

224
00:20:06,588 --> 00:20:10,888
The name is Dadier. Mr. Dadier.
Pronunciation is very important in English.

225
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:13,653
I'd hate to fail anyone
who couldn't pronounce it.

226
00:20:13,829 --> 00:20:15,797
- Me too, teach.
- Mr. Dadier.

227
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,955
- Yeah, sure.
- Say it.

228
00:20:24,373 --> 00:20:26,637
And take your hat off in this classroom.

229
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:31,740
You ever try to fight 35 guys
at one time, teach?

230
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,955
Take your hat off, boy,
before I knock it off.

231
00:21:08,317 --> 00:21:12,048
The subject you'll learn in this class
is English. Some of you may...

232
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:17,590
...wonder if English can help you get a job
as a carpenter, a mechanic or an electrician.

233
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:18,987
The answer is yes.

234
00:21:19,161 --> 00:21:22,619
It may surprise you to find
that English is your favorite subject.

235
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:25,392
- I'll be surprised.
- There will be no calling out.

236
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:28,536
If you've got any questions to ask,
just raise your hand.

237
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,604
- You hear that, Miller?
- Sure, teach.

238
00:21:30,772 --> 00:21:33,172
You coming in strong.
I can't tune you out.

239
00:21:33,342 --> 00:21:35,401
- His name ain't "teach."
- It's Daddy-oh.

240
00:21:35,577 --> 00:21:39,570
- Hey, don't you know his name, jerk?
- Excuse me, Mr. Jerk.

241
00:21:40,182 --> 00:21:43,948
West, since you're so cooperative,
stay after class and help me out.

242
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:46,519
- I'm busy.
- Oh, go on, Artie. Help him out.

243
00:21:46,688 --> 00:21:50,317
- Then you could be together alone.
- Oh, Daddy-oh!

244
00:21:53,428 --> 00:21:59,731
All right, all right, fine.
We had a few laughs.

245
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:02,267
In a minute, the bell's gonna ring
out there.

246
00:22:02,437 --> 00:22:06,305
You go to your civics class. Tomorrow
morning when you come to class...

247
00:22:06,475 --> 00:22:08,807
Hey, teach, you're coming back
here tomorrow?

248
00:22:08,977 --> 00:22:11,411
Why, sure I'm coming back.
You know why?

249
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,275
Because I'll miss you, West.

250
00:22:16,551 --> 00:22:19,315
All right, all right. Knock it off.
Now come on, huh?

251
00:22:19,488 --> 00:22:22,946
Listen, that's enough, huh?
What's the matter with you?

252
00:22:23,125 --> 00:22:25,685
You, Santini. What's your problem?

253
00:22:25,861 --> 00:22:27,829
- Me?
- Yeah, what are you grinning for?

254
00:22:27,996 --> 00:22:31,796
He's the grinningest cat in this
whole school. He smiles all the time.

255
00:22:31,967 --> 00:22:34,162
That's because he's an idiot boy.

256
00:22:35,971 --> 00:22:40,135
- Well, just try and pay attention, Santini.
- I pay attention.

257
00:22:44,579 --> 00:22:48,208
Hey, Miller. Come here.
I wanna talk to you a minute, Miller.

258
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,853
A man-to-man talk, huh, Miller?

259
00:22:57,025 --> 00:23:00,688
I've been looking up the records,
and you're a natural-born leader.

260
00:23:00,862 --> 00:23:02,090
- Really?
- Yeah. You are.

261
00:23:02,264 --> 00:23:04,664
Those guys out there,
they like you very much.

262
00:23:04,833 --> 00:23:06,300
Don't be modest with me.

263
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:09,528
You know you're a little brighter,
smarter than those guys.

264
00:23:09,704 --> 00:23:11,262
- Me?
- Yeah.

265
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,843
And every class needs a leader.
You could be that leader, Miller.

266
00:23:16,011 --> 00:23:17,308
What you do, they'll do.

267
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:21,973
You cooperate, and they'll follow you.
How about it, Miller?

268
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:28,388
- I don't know.
- I do know, Miller. How about it?

269
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:35,987
- Sure, if you think so.
- That's a boy. Good. That's fine, Miller.

270
00:23:37,699 --> 00:23:40,327
Oh, is this yours?

271
00:23:46,374 --> 00:23:49,810
- Take it easy, man.
- Sure, man.

272
00:24:03,959 --> 00:24:05,950
- Good night. Good night.
- Night.

273
00:24:06,828 --> 00:24:09,558
- Why, hello.
- Miss Hammond. Oh.

274
00:24:09,731 --> 00:24:13,064
- How did it go today?
- You mean after my disaster this morning?

275
00:24:13,235 --> 00:24:17,968
My entire class volunteered to stay after
school and pound erasers or something.

276
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,574
- Got a ride home?
- I have a private limousine.

277
00:24:20,742 --> 00:24:21,970
- Oh?
- City bus.

278
00:24:22,144 --> 00:24:26,274
- My way's more private. I'll give you a lift.
- Well, I have to check out first.

279
00:24:26,448 --> 00:24:29,417
That's all right. I'll meet you downstairs.

280
00:24:53,007 --> 00:24:57,501
- They don't know their multiplication tables.
- All they can multiply is themselves.

281
00:24:57,678 --> 00:25:00,146
- Well, how are they ever graduated?
- Graduated?

282
00:25:00,314 --> 00:25:01,747
- Going down?
- No. Going up.

283
00:25:01,916 --> 00:25:03,907
Graduated? They just get to be 18.

284
00:25:04,084 --> 00:25:07,520
Then they're thrown out to make room
for more of the same kind.

285
00:26:05,412 --> 00:26:08,245
You cockroach!

286
00:26:10,284 --> 00:26:11,808
What happened?

287
00:26:13,854 --> 00:26:15,515
Nothing.

288
00:26:19,426 --> 00:26:24,921
- What is it? What happened?
- Why, it's the first day of school, teacher.

289
00:26:28,202 --> 00:26:32,332
The way she screamed.
And the way she looked. Scared.

290
00:26:32,506 --> 00:26:34,371
Man, I mean real scared.

291
00:26:34,541 --> 00:26:38,102
I thought, "You know,
this could be happening to Anne."

292
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:42,046
- And then I hit him.
- Maybe she provoked the boy.

293
00:26:42,216 --> 00:26:44,650
- What?
- Well, teachers ought not to dress sexy.

294
00:26:44,818 --> 00:26:46,445
What do you mean? She had on...

295
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:49,851
What do you call it?
These sport outfits, buttoned up to here.

296
00:26:50,024 --> 00:26:52,618
I'll bet. And black net stockings too.

297
00:26:52,793 --> 00:26:55,626
No, they were kind of...
They were flesh-colored.

298
00:26:56,263 --> 00:26:57,594
I see.

299
00:26:58,899 --> 00:27:01,060
- Rick?
- Yeah?

300
00:27:01,235 --> 00:27:04,398
- Is she beautiful?
- Who?

301
00:27:04,571 --> 00:27:07,665
Miss Hammond, that's who.
Miss "Desirable" Hammond.

302
00:27:07,841 --> 00:27:12,141
Oh, yeah. I'd say that in a...
Well, a kind of a flashy way, she's...

303
00:27:12,312 --> 00:27:15,247
Yeah, I'd say she's...
Well, she's attractive.

304
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:18,874
What was I wearing
when you came home tonight?

305
00:27:19,386 --> 00:27:22,321
- What were you wearing?
- You never noticed, did you?

306
00:27:22,489 --> 00:27:25,890
Now wait a minute, let me think.
What were you wearing?

307
00:27:26,827 --> 00:27:30,661
You were wearing... Let's see,
you had on a blue outfit, didn't you?

308
00:27:30,831 --> 00:27:33,925
No, it was a blue...
The pink dress with the blue ribbon.

309
00:27:34,101 --> 00:27:38,265
You know, the little ribbon you wear
up here, and you had on a little apron.

310
00:27:39,139 --> 00:27:42,540
- You didn't take your iron tablets.
- Yes, I took my iron tablets.

311
00:27:42,709 --> 00:27:46,475
- You didn't think I was sexy, did you?
- I thought you were irresistible.

312
00:27:46,647 --> 00:27:47,875
Prove it.

313
00:27:48,048 --> 00:27:50,573
- What about your calcium tablets?
- More, please.

314
00:27:50,751 --> 00:27:53,777
- Did you take them?
- Don't be so medical.

315
00:27:53,954 --> 00:27:56,718
Look, what was she wearing?
What were you wearing?

316
00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:00,291
Now, what's this all about?
What was I wearing when I came home?

317
00:28:00,461 --> 00:28:03,794
- Turn out the lights and hold me.
- What was I wearing? Remember?

318
00:28:03,964 --> 00:28:05,295
- Do you?
- Your brown suit.

319
00:28:05,466 --> 00:28:07,627
- No, it wasn't the brown suit.
- Gray suit.

320
00:28:07,801 --> 00:28:09,860
- No.
- Striped necktie?

321
00:28:10,037 --> 00:28:11,402
- No?
- No.

322
00:28:12,473 --> 00:28:14,134
You don't remember, do you?

323
00:28:14,842 --> 00:28:17,037
Now, does that prove you don't love me?

324
00:28:17,911 --> 00:28:22,439
It just proves I'm silly and jealous
and love you too much.

325
00:28:25,652 --> 00:28:28,519
- He looked terrible.
- He must have hit him from behind.

326
00:28:28,689 --> 00:28:30,350
Teach must have some wallop.

327
00:28:30,524 --> 00:28:32,492
No, he hit him with brass knuckles.

328
00:28:32,659 --> 00:28:35,958
I seen them. He carries them
in that little old bag of his.

329
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:38,564
Four transfusions Joey had to have.

330
00:28:38,732 --> 00:28:40,927
His nose was busted too.

331
00:28:41,101 --> 00:28:42,728
What do you think, Artie?

332
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:46,004
They say he knocked all
Joey's front teeth out.

333
00:28:46,173 --> 00:28:47,834
What'd the teach hit him with?

334
00:28:48,008 --> 00:28:50,568
The teach was middleweight
champ of the Navy.

335
00:28:51,078 --> 00:28:52,375
- Hey, George.
- Hey, Joe.

336
00:29:06,827 --> 00:29:08,590
Morning, Miller.

337
00:29:54,741 --> 00:29:57,505
Today we'll pinpoint
some of your faults in grammar.

338
00:29:57,678 --> 00:29:59,942
I've written several sentences
on the board.

339
00:30:00,113 --> 00:30:04,812
Read them using the proper word.
Now, does everybody understand that?

340
00:30:08,355 --> 00:30:10,346
Well, you're very quiet today.

341
00:30:12,025 --> 00:30:14,255
All right, now let's get started.

342
00:30:14,828 --> 00:30:18,093
Don't be afraid to make mistakes
because that's how you learn.

343
00:30:18,265 --> 00:30:19,994
By making mistakes.

344
00:30:20,167 --> 00:30:22,658
All right, Miller, will you take the first one?

345
00:30:28,175 --> 00:30:30,871
"Henry hasn't written no answer
to my letter."

346
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:37,974
No, Miller. It should be "Henry hasn't
written any answer to my letter."

347
00:30:39,586 --> 00:30:43,613
- De Lica, second one.
- "If I were him, I wouldn't say that."

348
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:47,624
If I were you, I wouldn't say that either.
It should be, "If I were he."

349
00:30:47,794 --> 00:30:50,456
- West, third one.
- "I throwed the ball fast."

350
00:30:50,631 --> 00:30:54,567
You know better. This is third-term stuff.
You had that two years ago.

351
00:30:54,735 --> 00:30:58,967
- "Won't anyone borrow you a pen?"
- "The class choose him as president."

352
00:30:59,139 --> 00:31:01,039
"Where was you when it happened?"

353
00:31:05,746 --> 00:31:08,510
We didn't do very well with this, did we?

354
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:16,618
All right. A little homework
will straighten that out.

355
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,121
Homework? Are you..?

356
00:31:18,292 --> 00:31:22,285
Yes, homework. You can start copying
all 35 sentences in your notebooks now.

357
00:31:22,462 --> 00:31:25,659
- It ain't even the first week.
- I gotta work after school.

358
00:31:25,832 --> 00:31:30,531
This will count as a test. It might decide
whether you pass or fail this course.

359
00:31:34,841 --> 00:31:36,138
Miller?

360
00:31:47,988 --> 00:31:49,478
This...

361
00:31:51,258 --> 00:31:52,850
This was your idea, wasn't it?

362
00:31:53,026 --> 00:31:55,256
- What idea is that?
- This silent treatment.

363
00:31:55,429 --> 00:31:57,624
Picking the wrong answers deliberately.

364
00:31:57,798 --> 00:31:59,993
Look, I know you're the leader. Fine.

365
00:32:00,167 --> 00:32:02,965
But you're leading them
in the wrong direction. Why?

366
00:32:03,136 --> 00:32:05,661
Maybe you ought to mind
your own business, chief.

367
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:10,139
Not many guys like what happened to Joe
Murray. He going to jail. You know that?

368
00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:13,279
I see. That's why you set
the class against me, huh?

369
00:32:13,447 --> 00:32:16,712
They don't need no excuse.
Or me to help them.

370
00:32:16,883 --> 00:32:19,181
Well, what about that talk
we had, Miller?

371
00:32:19,353 --> 00:32:23,289
Suppose we just forget about
that little snow job, Mr. Dadier.

372
00:32:35,969 --> 00:32:40,736
- Hi. I wanted to thank you.
- That's all right.

373
00:32:40,907 --> 00:32:43,341
Would you mind walking
out to the car with me?

374
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:46,274
- With those kids out there and all, I...
- No.

375
00:32:46,446 --> 00:32:49,347
- If it's too much trouble for you...
- No, not at all.

376
00:32:49,516 --> 00:32:50,813
Thanks.

377
00:32:51,852 --> 00:32:55,151
I hope I haven't hindered you
with your classes.

378
00:32:55,989 --> 00:32:57,547
How'd you make out today?

379
00:32:57,724 --> 00:33:02,127
Oh, the boys were very quiet.
I guess I know what they were thinking.

380
00:33:12,572 --> 00:33:14,836
- Hello, Josh.
- Hi.

381
00:33:23,717 --> 00:33:25,344
- How about a drink?
- Yeah. Fine.

382
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,544
Let's go over there.

383
00:33:45,372 --> 00:33:49,706
- I gotta... I gotta get home.
- Well, this is the last one. For the road.

384
00:33:49,876 --> 00:33:51,434
For the road.

385
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:59,710
Stan the man.

386
00:33:59,886 --> 00:34:01,945
Terrific stuff.

387
00:34:02,122 --> 00:34:07,617
- Very educated gentleman.
- Yeah. Just like our students.

388
00:34:09,229 --> 00:34:13,723
Everything always comes back
to our students. You know something?

389
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:17,836
I am disappointed. Very disappointed.

390
00:34:18,004 --> 00:34:21,838
Listen. Listen to this passage. Listen.

391
00:34:22,008 --> 00:34:24,670
Mind those trumpets.

392
00:34:28,014 --> 00:34:29,504
There's always that.

393
00:34:39,726 --> 00:34:41,455
Oh, bartender?

394
00:34:43,263 --> 00:34:49,532
I wonder if there are many alcoholics
among high school teachers.

395
00:34:49,703 --> 00:34:54,140
It's not fair, Rick. I wanna teach.

396
00:34:54,307 --> 00:34:56,639
I really wanna teach.

397
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:59,301
- So why don't they let me teach?
- I...

398
00:34:59,479 --> 00:35:03,006
Any man who really wants to teach
should be allowed to teach.

399
00:35:03,183 --> 00:35:05,276
I know. I know.

400
00:35:05,452 --> 00:35:07,215
- Did I tell you?
- What?

401
00:35:07,387 --> 00:35:10,948
I'm bringing my record collection
in and playing it for the class.

402
00:35:11,124 --> 00:35:14,184
- Yeah.
- Yeah, what?

403
00:35:14,361 --> 00:35:18,229
What do you mean, "Yeah, what"?
You told me you're bringing your records...

404
00:35:18,398 --> 00:35:22,528
I mean, now wait a minute.
Suppose they don't like it? The records.

405
00:35:22,702 --> 00:35:24,294
Why not?

406
00:35:24,471 --> 00:35:28,100
Listen, it took me 15 years
to collect those records.

407
00:35:28,275 --> 00:35:31,574
Half those records can't even be replaced.

408
00:35:31,745 --> 00:35:36,478
Besides, music is based on mathematics.
Am I right?

409
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:38,914
- Yeah.
- What do I teach? Mathematics.

410
00:35:39,085 --> 00:35:42,612
- You're right. Absolutely right.
- To teaching.

411
00:35:45,492 --> 00:35:46,857
To teaching.

412
00:35:59,372 --> 00:36:03,206
I gotta get home fast.
My wife's pregnant, you know.

413
00:36:03,376 --> 00:36:06,345
- Well, congratulations.
- Thanks.

414
00:36:06,513 --> 00:36:09,573
Hey, let's take a cut through here.
Shortcut to the bus.

415
00:36:09,749 --> 00:36:11,444
All right.

416
00:36:14,321 --> 00:36:18,018
Yes, sir.
It's the best profession anywhere.

417
00:36:18,558 --> 00:36:21,789
- Kids.
- Yeah.

418
00:36:21,962 --> 00:36:25,261
- Best profession anywhere.
- Why don't they let me teach?

419
00:36:25,432 --> 00:36:29,425
- I guess because they're bad guys.
- They're not bad. They're just ignorant.

420
00:36:29,603 --> 00:36:32,094
Bad and ignorant.

421
00:36:32,272 --> 00:36:34,832
You don't really believe that, do you?

422
00:36:35,008 --> 00:36:39,468
No, I... I don't really mean it, Josh.

423
00:36:41,314 --> 00:36:43,407
I don't really mean it.

424
00:36:46,753 --> 00:36:48,687
Josh.

425
00:36:49,055 --> 00:36:51,751
- That's funny.
- What's funny?

426
00:36:51,925 --> 00:36:56,362
- Footsteps. You hear..?
- Hey, Daddy-oh.

427
00:37:20,353 --> 00:37:23,015
I don't want you to forget
Joe Murray, teach.

428
00:37:47,847 --> 00:37:52,181
Oh, Josh. Josh.

429
00:38:12,172 --> 00:38:16,131
- Hello?
<i>- Mr. Dadier there?</i>

430
00:38:16,309 --> 00:38:20,473
No. No, no. He isn't here right now.
Who is this?

431
00:38:20,647 --> 00:38:24,083
Hello? Hello.

432
00:38:33,193 --> 00:38:36,959
- Turn out the lights.
- Well, Rick.

433
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:38,654
The lights.

434
00:38:43,703 --> 00:38:45,295
Rick.

435
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:57,443
You mustn't be scared. I'm hurt.

436
00:38:57,617 --> 00:39:00,552
- I'll call a doctor.
- No, no. I'll be all right.

437
00:39:00,787 --> 00:39:03,517
Just don't look at me, Anne. Please.

438
00:39:03,690 --> 00:39:06,523
No, please. You mustn't.

439
00:39:06,926 --> 00:39:11,056
A thing like this could...
I don't want you to lose the baby, Anne.

440
00:39:14,167 --> 00:39:16,863
You're never going back
to that school again. Never.

441
00:39:17,036 --> 00:39:19,630
Oh, yes, I am.

442
00:39:19,806 --> 00:39:23,799
Yeah, I've been beaten up.
But I'm not beaten.

443
00:39:23,977 --> 00:39:28,346
There's a big difference. I'm not beaten...

444
00:39:28,548 --> 00:39:30,914
...and I'm not quitting.

445
00:39:47,133 --> 00:39:52,264
What's the answer, professor?
Oh, I'm going back to the school tomorrow.

446
00:39:52,438 --> 00:39:55,737
Anne doesn't want me to go,
and maybe she's right.

447
00:39:55,909 --> 00:39:59,037
Is it hopeless? Is there no way to..?

448
00:39:59,212 --> 00:40:02,909
To get through to those kids?
Is there no way to make them understand?

449
00:40:03,082 --> 00:40:05,880
- You'll find a way.
- And what if I don't? What then?

450
00:40:06,052 --> 00:40:09,544
What's the point of teaching if kids
don't care about an education?

451
00:40:09,722 --> 00:40:14,591
- And make no mistake about it, they don't.
- You're wrong.

452
00:40:14,761 --> 00:40:17,252
You're the blind man who visits
an elephant.

453
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:22,925
He feels the tail, and he says,
"An elephant must be like a snake."

454
00:40:23,102 --> 00:40:24,535
Come.

455
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:28,102
<i>Porto</i>, to carry.

456
00:40:28,274 --> 00:40:34,213
<i>Porto, portas, portat.</i>
<i>Portamus, portatis, portant.</i>

457
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:12,615
Any teacher could get through to students
like these. The students I have, why bother?

458
00:41:12,785 --> 00:41:16,846
- All children are entitled to an education.
- I'm not prepared for my job.

459
00:41:17,023 --> 00:41:20,618
You were my college professor.
Should've taught me how to stop a fight.

460
00:41:20,793 --> 00:41:25,287
How to deal with an IQ of 66. How to
quiet a class of screaming, wild animals.

461
00:41:25,465 --> 00:41:28,059
Why bother about them?
They'll survive without me.

462
00:41:28,234 --> 00:41:31,203
- Who wants animals on the street?
- If I'm a lion tamer...

463
00:41:31,371 --> 00:41:33,601
...I should teach with a chair and whip.

464
00:41:35,241 --> 00:41:38,005
Yes. We at the university were to blame.

465
00:41:38,177 --> 00:41:42,079
We did not prepare teachers to teach
certain children of this generation.

466
00:41:42,248 --> 00:41:46,651
Tell me, Richard. Why do you want
to be a teacher? Just to earn a living?

467
00:41:47,887 --> 00:41:51,516
- No.
- It is easier, perhaps, than some other job?

468
00:41:53,293 --> 00:41:54,817
Easier?

469
00:41:57,363 --> 00:41:59,558
Perhaps you're dedicated.

470
00:42:02,869 --> 00:42:05,599
No, hardly. No, I wanna teach.

471
00:42:05,772 --> 00:42:10,175
Most of us wanna do something creative.
I can't be a painter, writer or engineer.

472
00:42:10,343 --> 00:42:16,407
But I thought that if I could help to shape
young minds, sort of sculpt lives...

473
00:42:16,849 --> 00:42:20,512
...and by teaching, I'd be creative.
- For every school like yours...

474
00:42:20,687 --> 00:42:25,249
...there are hundreds like this one. We could
use you, but your school needs you.

475
00:42:25,425 --> 00:42:28,019
You still want to teach here
in this school?

476
00:42:34,767 --> 00:42:37,793
I think I'll take another crack at my jungle.

477
00:42:58,191 --> 00:43:00,785
Report says you couldn't identify
any of the boys.

478
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,157
It was dark. I told you it was dark.
I couldn't see anything.

479
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:07,695
What are you protecting? The good name
of this school? Your job?

480
00:43:07,867 --> 00:43:11,428
- Someone gotta die before you'll cooperate?
- It wasn't that serious.

481
00:43:11,604 --> 00:43:15,870
- Weren't in class for a week. That's serious.
- What do you expect me to do?

482
00:43:16,042 --> 00:43:19,443
Press charges. I'll find
the ones who did it.

483
00:43:19,612 --> 00:43:23,070
- I'll go over every kid in this school.
- You'll do more harm.

484
00:43:23,249 --> 00:43:26,980
Mr. Dadier, I've handled lots
of problem kids in my time.

485
00:43:27,153 --> 00:43:29,018
Kids from both sides of the tracks.

486
00:43:29,188 --> 00:43:32,749
They were 5 or 6 years old in
the last war. Father in the Army.

487
00:43:32,925 --> 00:43:36,656
Mother in a defense plant.
No home life. No church life.

488
00:43:36,829 --> 00:43:40,265
No place to go. They formed street gangs.

489
00:43:40,733 --> 00:43:43,702
It's way over my head, Mr. Dadier.

490
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:48,739
Maybe the kids today are like the rest
of the world. Mixed-up, suspicious, scared.

491
00:43:48,908 --> 00:43:52,036
I don't know. But I do know this:

492
00:43:52,211 --> 00:43:55,874
Gang leaders have taken the place
of parents. If you don't stop them...

493
00:43:56,049 --> 00:43:58,950
- Class is starting. You mind?
- Then you won't help us?

494
00:43:59,118 --> 00:44:00,551
- I'm sorry.
- Sure.

495
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,212
- And I hope you'll never be sorrier.
- Thanks anyway.

496
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:08,588
For what? Tying our hands
so it can happen again?

497
00:44:09,896 --> 00:44:13,491
And don't worry. It will.

498
00:44:33,386 --> 00:44:37,982
Welcome back, chief. You bring
your cosmetics to school, chief?

499
00:44:38,157 --> 00:44:42,025
Don't get touchy, chief.
I know lots of guys use makeup.

500
00:44:44,263 --> 00:44:49,826
Well, at least the silent treatment
seems to have ended.

501
00:45:04,584 --> 00:45:07,678
- New machine shop, chief.
- Since when?

502
00:45:07,854 --> 00:45:10,379
Installed her last week.

503
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:13,820
Does this..? Does this go on all the time?

504
00:45:13,993 --> 00:45:16,120
Most any time.

505
00:45:16,996 --> 00:45:20,523
Oh, no. That's great.

506
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:22,691
It's all we needed.

507
00:45:24,904 --> 00:45:27,338
This is a tape recorder.

508
00:45:27,507 --> 00:45:30,067
- Was we gonna make records, teach?
- That's right.

509
00:45:30,243 --> 00:45:33,144
- Well, go, man. Go.
- Go.

510
00:45:33,513 --> 00:45:36,880
Now, we all talk too much,
but nobody listens.

511
00:45:39,819 --> 00:45:41,810
Nobody listens.

512
00:45:41,988 --> 00:45:45,355
I thought, perhaps, we talk into
this machine, then we listen...

513
00:45:45,525 --> 00:45:49,017
Oh, it's a speech period.
"How I spent my summer vacation."

514
00:45:49,195 --> 00:45:53,689
- This ought to be real jazzy.
- No. No speeches.

515
00:45:53,866 --> 00:45:56,494
One thing I didn't like when
I went to school...

516
00:45:56,669 --> 00:46:01,572
- Teach, teach. Did you go to high school?
- Can't you see, man, he ain't never got out.

517
00:46:02,909 --> 00:46:07,539
Well, since you wanna talk so very badly,
I guess I'm not gonna have much trouble...

518
00:46:07,713 --> 00:46:12,650
...getting you to talk into this machine.
- What kind of talk? Snappy stories?

519
00:46:15,388 --> 00:46:19,222
Miller, how'd you like to bring
your mother to school?

520
00:46:19,392 --> 00:46:22,361
How'd you like to bring yours?

521
00:46:22,528 --> 00:46:25,554
Hey, Morales got a sister.
Maybe he'd like to bring her.

522
00:46:25,731 --> 00:46:28,495
Come on with those records, man.

523
00:46:28,668 --> 00:46:32,331
Hey, what do you say we all sing a little?
Come on.

524
00:46:32,705 --> 00:46:37,165
- "The Last Rose of Summer."
- Teach, you got that recorder going?

525
00:46:37,343 --> 00:46:39,208
Quiet!

526
00:46:43,883 --> 00:46:48,013
All right, now, who's gonna be
the first to try this out?

527
00:46:48,988 --> 00:46:52,048
- How about Morales?
- Hey, what's the matter with Morales?

528
00:46:52,225 --> 00:46:56,423
- Sure, Morales. He loves to talk.
- No. Tomita. Step up here and try it.

529
00:46:56,596 --> 00:46:59,861
You against Morales because
he don't talk good English?

530
00:47:01,634 --> 00:47:05,536
- That has nothing to do with it.
- Morales get up there. I wanna hear you.

531
00:47:05,705 --> 00:47:09,232
- Come on, Morales.
- Come on, chicken.

532
00:47:09,408 --> 00:47:11,103
We want Morales.

533
00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:14,877
- Hey, chicken.
<i>- We want Morales.</i>

534
00:47:16,215 --> 00:47:18,274
I no chicken.

535
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:26,857
- All right. Start talking.
- What am I gonna talk about?

536
00:47:27,026 --> 00:47:31,053
Talk about anything. How you got up
this morning, took the bus to school.

537
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:32,697
- Well...
- Go ahead.

538
00:47:32,865 --> 00:47:36,562
I got up at 7:30, go wash.

539
00:47:36,736 --> 00:47:40,900
But my stinking sister, she's still
in the bathroom, so I can't get in.

540
00:47:41,941 --> 00:47:43,875
That's fine, boy. Just keep talking.

541
00:47:44,577 --> 00:47:48,570
So then I go to the stinking bathroom.
I wash my stinking face.

542
00:47:48,748 --> 00:47:51,774
- Then I ate some stinking sausages.
- Louder, come on.

543
00:47:51,951 --> 00:47:56,354
- We can't hear you in the balcony.
- So then I go down the stinking street...

544
00:47:56,522 --> 00:48:00,356
...with my stinking books, and then
I meet this stink-face. And he says:

545
00:48:00,526 --> 00:48:03,689
"You go to school, Pete?"
I say, "You stinking right, boy."

546
00:48:03,863 --> 00:48:07,492
So we walked to the stinking EI,
and we wait for the stinking train.

547
00:48:07,667 --> 00:48:13,037
What do you think? The stinking train is
late. So I gotta get into the stinking crowd.

548
00:48:13,205 --> 00:48:16,299
And that's why I'm stinking late
to school, teach.

549
00:48:16,475 --> 00:48:20,104
- How was I? Okay?
- You sure stunk up that record, boy.

550
00:48:25,718 --> 00:48:28,380
- That'll be enough for today.
- You gonna play it?

551
00:48:28,554 --> 00:48:32,752
No. Thanks for picking Morales.

552
00:48:32,925 --> 00:48:36,383
- I'm sure you're his friend.
- Sure enough, chief.

553
00:48:36,562 --> 00:48:39,395
Too bad you can't see the same.

554
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:44,099
- And just what does that mean?
- Morales is a spic, that's what it means.

555
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:47,034
- Maybe you don't like spics.
- That'll be enough.

556
00:48:47,206 --> 00:48:50,039
- What did I do, anyhow?
- Sit down, spic.

557
00:48:50,209 --> 00:48:53,701
- You heard him, greaseball.
- At least I'm no Irish Mick.

558
00:48:53,879 --> 00:48:55,574
I said, that'd be enough.

559
00:48:55,915 --> 00:48:58,577
Now, pick up that magazine, Belazi.

560
00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:01,677
Pick it up.

561
00:49:06,726 --> 00:49:10,423
I wanna get one thing
very clear in this classroom.

562
00:49:10,596 --> 00:49:14,692
There's not gonna be any name-calling here.
Not today, not tomorrow, not ever.

563
00:49:14,867 --> 00:49:16,767
- Understand?
- I was just kidding.

564
00:49:16,936 --> 00:49:18,733
Yeah, I know you're just kidding.

565
00:49:18,904 --> 00:49:23,034
That's how things start. Like a street fight.
Somebody pushes somebody in fun.

566
00:49:23,209 --> 00:49:26,872
Somebody pushes back, and soon you
got a street fight with no kidding.

567
00:49:27,046 --> 00:49:29,708
That's the same way with name-calling.

568
00:49:29,882 --> 00:49:33,613
All right, West, look. You're of
Irish decent. So is Murphy over there.

569
00:49:33,786 --> 00:49:37,745
You call him a Mick. He calls you a Mick.
Suppose Miller called you a Mick.

570
00:49:37,923 --> 00:49:39,686
Is that all right?

571
00:49:40,326 --> 00:49:42,419
No. Then you call him a nigger.

572
00:49:42,595 --> 00:49:44,722
- I was just kidding.
- Well, stop kidding!

573
00:49:44,897 --> 00:49:46,660
- Sure.
- Come on, come on, tell me.

574
00:49:46,832 --> 00:49:49,801
Tell me all about your stinking sister.

575
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:54,662
You gonna play
Morales' record back, chief?

576
00:50:08,287 --> 00:50:11,120
- Mr. Warneke wanted to see me?
- Sit down.

577
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:13,952
- That'll be all, Murdock.
- But, Mr. Warneke...

578
00:50:14,126 --> 00:50:17,152
There are no buts. None that
forgive slapping a student.

579
00:50:17,329 --> 00:50:20,526
- If you can't control yourself...
- Yes, sir. I understand.

580
00:50:22,134 --> 00:50:23,795
Dadier.

581
00:50:25,771 --> 00:50:27,898
He's rough today.

582
00:50:34,547 --> 00:50:36,447
Sit down, Dadier.

583
00:50:40,486 --> 00:50:44,547
Problems. Nothing but problems,
eh, Dadier?

584
00:50:44,723 --> 00:50:47,157
Well, not the same as you have, sir.

585
00:50:47,326 --> 00:50:52,593
If it isn't one thing, it's another.
Brutality, stupidity, bigotry.

586
00:50:52,765 --> 00:50:56,428
Would you believe that some teachers
are guilty of racial prejudice...

587
00:50:56,602 --> 00:50:59,127
...in their classes, in this school?

588
00:50:59,305 --> 00:51:02,763
- I wouldn't know, sir.
- Comes out under pressure, I suppose.

589
00:51:02,942 --> 00:51:05,001
Yeah, I suppose so.

590
00:51:06,512 --> 00:51:09,709
If you knew of such a teacher,
would you tell me about it?

591
00:51:11,484 --> 00:51:13,543
- I don't know.
- You don't know? Why not?

592
00:51:13,719 --> 00:51:16,017
I don't know this idea of carrying tales.

593
00:51:16,188 --> 00:51:19,453
You have someone in particular
in mind, Mr. Warneke?

594
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:23,119
What part of the country are you from?

595
00:51:31,136 --> 00:51:34,037
How do you feel about Negroes, Dadier?

596
00:51:34,807 --> 00:51:38,709
- How do I feel about..?
- Well, do you consider them inferior?

597
00:51:38,878 --> 00:51:41,472
- As a race?
- Any way.

598
00:51:41,647 --> 00:51:44,582
- No, I don't consider them inferior.
- What about spics?

599
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:48,652
- Spics?
- Spics. Do you like them?

600
00:51:49,388 --> 00:51:52,482
- Depends on the individual.
- What does that mean, Dadier?

601
00:51:52,658 --> 00:51:55,786
There are Puerto Ricans I like,
and some I don't like.

602
00:51:55,961 --> 00:51:58,361
I see. What about Irish Micks?

603
00:51:58,531 --> 00:52:02,023
I don't know what this is all about,
but if there's some teacher...

604
00:52:02,201 --> 00:52:06,831
I'm talking about you, Dadier. You're the
teacher who's supposed to be the bigot.

605
00:52:07,706 --> 00:52:08,968
What?

606
00:52:09,141 --> 00:52:12,736
It's reported that you maligned
religious and racial groups in class.

607
00:52:12,912 --> 00:52:15,676
- That's what this is about, Dadier.
- That's a lie.

608
00:52:15,848 --> 00:52:21,252
Is it? Did you use the expression
"nigger" in your class?

609
00:52:22,388 --> 00:52:24,322
- Yes.
- Then it is true.

610
00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:26,481
- Just wait...
- Did you use "spic"?

611
00:52:26,659 --> 00:52:29,628
- Yes, I used it in the same lesson...
- Lesson?

612
00:52:29,795 --> 00:52:33,322
- Yes.
- What textbook did you get this from?

613
00:52:33,499 --> 00:52:36,297
- Just listen to me a minute...
- You listen!

614
00:52:36,468 --> 00:52:41,337
I don't care if a boy's skin is black, yellow,
purple. He gets the same teaching, breaks...

615
00:52:41,507 --> 00:52:45,136
...as any white boy. Do you
understand that? Do you?

616
00:52:45,311 --> 00:52:49,907
There's enough immorality in the world.
Without your adding to it. Enough hatred.

617
00:52:50,082 --> 00:52:53,813
Hold it! You just hold it.

618
00:52:56,155 --> 00:53:00,888
I used that expression to teach a lesson
in democracy. What should not be said.

619
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:04,655
- Those were negative examples.
- Not according to my report.

620
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:07,230
- This boy has accused...
- What boy?

621
00:53:07,399 --> 00:53:09,663
- A boy in your class.
- What was his name?

622
00:53:09,835 --> 00:53:11,826
Can't tell you that.

623
00:53:12,004 --> 00:53:16,168
Well, suppose he's lying. Don't I have
any right to face my accuser?

624
00:53:16,342 --> 00:53:20,506
I know I don't have any as a teacher left,
but what about my rights as a human?

625
00:53:20,679 --> 00:53:26,140
- Nobody's depriving you of any rights.
- You accuse me. You condemn me...

626
00:53:26,318 --> 00:53:29,981
...without even a hearing.
- Look, I'm sorry, Dadier. I...

627
00:53:30,155 --> 00:53:33,352
...may have been hasty.
If I'm wrong, I apologize.

628
00:53:33,525 --> 00:53:35,322
You were wrong.

629
00:53:36,161 --> 00:53:38,061
In that case...

630
00:53:42,801 --> 00:53:45,497
Dadier...

631
00:53:45,671 --> 00:53:50,608
...I recall that you had some
dramatic training in college.

632
00:53:50,776 --> 00:53:53,438
Will you take charge
of our Christmas show?

633
00:53:54,179 --> 00:53:58,843
Well, is this a penalty?
Is this a reward? What is it?

634
00:53:59,018 --> 00:54:01,452
Just an extra job.

635
00:54:04,256 --> 00:54:05,951
All right.

636
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,365
Miller?

637
00:54:17,903 --> 00:54:20,872
- What were you doing?
- Doing?

638
00:54:21,206 --> 00:54:23,800
I'm just going down
to the machine shop, chief.

639
00:54:23,976 --> 00:54:29,107
- This late after school?
- Doing a little homework on this carburetor.

640
00:54:30,149 --> 00:54:35,052
What kept you after school, chief?
You doing your homework here too?

641
00:54:35,988 --> 00:54:37,512
Miller.

642
00:54:39,992 --> 00:54:42,426
You went to see Mr. Warneke
today, didn't you?

643
00:54:42,594 --> 00:54:45,461
- Did I?
- Yes, and you told him a lot of lies.

644
00:54:45,631 --> 00:54:48,566
A lot of deliberate lies.
You twisted everything I said.

645
00:54:48,734 --> 00:54:51,999
There was no racial issue till you made one.

646
00:54:52,171 --> 00:54:54,969
- Wait a minute, Miller.
- What is it, chief?

647
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:58,473
- What is what?
- Why you got the knife out for me?

648
00:54:58,644 --> 00:55:03,138
Why I've got the knife out for..?
Oh, man, there's a real switch.

649
00:55:03,315 --> 00:55:07,775
After all the trouble you caused. After the
way you fouled up that recording session.

650
00:55:07,953 --> 00:55:11,548
- After the way you and West...
- Steady now. Just a minute.

651
00:55:11,724 --> 00:55:14,192
- The way we did what?
- Ganged up on me.

652
00:55:14,359 --> 00:55:17,726
- You don't mean that, chief.
- I do mean it.

653
00:55:17,896 --> 00:55:21,229
- Boy, you really got it bad.
- You deny it?

654
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:25,700
- Well, do you deny it?
- You gonna hit me? I'd really like that.

655
00:55:25,871 --> 00:55:29,967
That's all you need, boy. That'll
really wash you up around here.

656
00:55:30,142 --> 00:55:33,634
Come on. Start swinging. Come on.
You go ahead. Come on.

657
00:55:33,812 --> 00:55:37,646
- Why, you black...
- Go ahead and say it.

658
00:55:37,816 --> 00:55:41,479
- You say it. Now, you go ahead and hit me.
- I'm sorry.

659
00:55:41,653 --> 00:55:44,451
I'm sorry what I just said, Miller.

660
00:55:44,623 --> 00:55:47,717
There's no excuse.
I just lost my head. I'm sorry.

661
00:55:51,063 --> 00:55:52,792
Yeah.

662
00:55:55,534 --> 00:55:57,092
Miller.

663
00:56:01,173 --> 00:56:04,006
Truck will be here any minute.
You ready, Louie?

664
00:56:04,176 --> 00:56:07,168
Come on, pay attention when
I'm talking to you, stupid.

665
00:56:07,346 --> 00:56:08,711
We been over it 50 times.

666
00:56:08,881 --> 00:56:12,044
I slug the guy, Pee Wee takes
the wheel. What's so special?

667
00:56:12,217 --> 00:56:16,449
Look, you just stay with him in case
he needs you. That's what's so special.

668
00:56:18,157 --> 00:56:24,062
Look, you drive to the park, dump
the papers and get rid of the truck.

669
00:56:24,229 --> 00:56:27,995
When the guy sells the papers, we meet
back here and divvy up. Got that?

670
00:56:28,167 --> 00:56:30,328
- You sure you got it, now?
- Got it.

671
00:56:35,407 --> 00:56:38,001
Don't worry about it.

672
00:56:38,177 --> 00:56:40,509
Go ahead, blow. Move.

673
00:56:48,687 --> 00:56:51,679
How's the teaching business coming along?

674
00:57:10,876 --> 00:57:14,505
Hey, what's the chance of getting
a job driving a truck like this?

675
00:57:28,894 --> 00:57:35,265
Easy, teach. Easy. You could've got hurt
over there just now. What happened?

676
00:57:35,434 --> 00:57:38,460
- Where'd you come from?
- I was just strolling along...

677
00:57:38,637 --> 00:57:42,801
...and I saw some guy throw a bottle
at you. I figured they're out to get you.

678
00:57:42,975 --> 00:57:45,136
You could've been maybe shot
or something.

679
00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:48,939
Yeah, or something.
Was that Belazi with those kids?

680
00:57:49,114 --> 00:57:51,844
- Belazi? You mean from our class?
- That's right.

681
00:57:52,017 --> 00:57:55,919
Wearing the same jacket, like you are.
Members of the same gang, right?

682
00:57:56,088 --> 00:57:59,683
It's a club, teach. It's a club
I belong to. I didn't see Belazi.

683
00:57:59,858 --> 00:58:03,487
You didn't see those kids steal that
newspaper truck either, did you?

684
00:58:03,662 --> 00:58:05,857
- You're just passing by.
- Right, I said...

685
00:58:06,031 --> 00:58:09,125
...I was just strolling by.
Why should I lie to you?

686
00:58:09,301 --> 00:58:14,136
- I don't give a damn what you believe.
- Know what happens when they're caught?

687
00:58:14,306 --> 00:58:18,470
- What's that, teach?
- Reform school, year in jail. Maybe more.

688
00:58:18,644 --> 00:58:22,273
A year from now, when the Army
comes and says, "Okay, Artie West...

689
00:58:22,447 --> 00:58:25,382
...you get in a uniform, be a soldier,
save the world...

690
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:28,246
...and you get your lousy head
blowed right off."

691
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:31,753
Well, maybe I'll get a year in jail,
and when I come out...

692
00:58:31,924 --> 00:58:34,757
...they don't want Artie West
to be a soldier no more.

693
00:58:34,927 --> 00:58:38,522
- Maybe what I get is out.
- I see.

694
00:58:38,697 --> 00:58:42,292
- Do you, teach? Do you?
- West, you got it all wrong...

695
00:58:42,467 --> 00:58:44,628
Come on, get them off.

696
00:58:45,203 --> 00:58:50,368
Look, you're in my classroom now.
And what I could teach you.

697
00:58:50,542 --> 00:58:53,978
The first lesson is, don't butt in. Just don't.

698
00:58:54,146 --> 00:58:57,206
Or you could flunk out for good.

699
00:59:10,963 --> 00:59:13,158
- Hey, what you got there, teach?
- Music.

700
00:59:13,332 --> 00:59:15,391
- Wasn't that music?
- For the next class.

701
00:59:15,567 --> 00:59:18,035
- What's the matter?
- Ask the disc jockey.

702
00:59:18,203 --> 00:59:20,603
- Records.
- Just keep your hands off of them.

703
00:59:20,772 --> 00:59:23,468
- Beg your pardon.
- Come on, teach, play something.

704
00:59:23,642 --> 00:59:27,134
Old Joshua, he's got a test for us.
Right, Josh?

705
00:59:27,646 --> 00:59:32,948
You see, music is based on mathematics,
and it's just that the next class...

706
00:59:33,118 --> 00:59:35,916
...is a little more advanced.
- We're advanced, teach.

707
00:59:36,088 --> 00:59:37,988
- Two times two is four.
- Are four.

708
00:59:38,156 --> 00:59:41,148
Haven't you heard that music
soothes the savage beast?

709
00:59:41,326 --> 00:59:44,090
- Okay. Take your seats.
- We're crazy about music.

710
00:59:44,262 --> 00:59:49,165
Mr. Edwards, why not play a record,
and then we'll all take the test.

711
00:59:49,334 --> 00:59:51,825
- Sure.
- Please.

712
00:59:52,004 --> 00:59:55,405
- Oh, come on, teach.
- Well...

713
00:59:56,475 --> 00:59:59,740
...all right. This...

714
00:59:59,911 --> 01:00:04,371
This is kind of a rare one. This is Bix
Beiderbeke doing "Jazz Me Blues."

715
01:00:04,549 --> 01:00:07,211
- How about some bop?
- Yeah, bop us, teach.

716
01:00:07,386 --> 01:00:08,978
Listen to this.

717
01:00:10,922 --> 01:00:13,117
Pay attention to that cornet.

718
01:00:13,625 --> 01:00:16,594
Beiderbeke came before James
and Elman and Spivak.

719
01:00:16,762 --> 01:00:18,821
- How about Frank Sinatra?
- Frankie.

720
01:00:18,997 --> 01:00:21,363
- Joni James.
- Come on, get with it, man.

721
01:00:21,533 --> 01:00:25,196
- This is "Cow Cow Boogie."
- All right, keep away from the records.

722
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:29,238
- Give me the record.
- Sure, teach.

723
01:00:30,142 --> 01:00:33,771
This is "Cherokee."
Anybody wanna hear this record, huh?

724
01:00:39,718 --> 01:00:43,484
Hey, "Clap Hands! Here Comes Charlie."

725
01:00:49,194 --> 01:00:51,389
"Blue Moon."

726
01:01:16,888 --> 01:01:20,380
- Wait till Miller hears about this.
- Where's that Miller man today?

727
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:23,960
- He's cutting class today.
- When there's action, he cuts.

728
01:01:24,129 --> 01:01:26,689
That's funny. I was someplace else too.

729
01:01:26,865 --> 01:01:28,594
Nobody was here.

730
01:02:06,004 --> 01:02:08,063
They broke my records.

731
01:02:11,810 --> 01:02:14,074
I don't understand, Rick.

732
01:02:15,614 --> 01:02:18,310
I just don't understand.

733
01:02:33,932 --> 01:02:38,665
Now, the broken records can never be
replaced. The phonograph cost about $40.

734
01:02:38,837 --> 01:02:41,738
I don't know which of you did it.

735
01:02:41,907 --> 01:02:44,398
But I know that none of you
tried to stop it.

736
01:02:44,576 --> 01:02:49,206
So whenever you can, you just put your
nickels and your dimes in this tin can.

737
01:02:49,381 --> 01:02:54,318
Can you deduct it from taxes?

738
01:03:04,196 --> 01:03:07,791
- But how did Warneke discipline the kids?
- A masterful stroke.

739
01:03:09,467 --> 01:03:13,164
He taught those little Mongolians
a lesson they'll never forget.

740
01:03:13,338 --> 01:03:18,708
You know what he did? He got them
all in the auditorium, and he had them...

741
01:03:18,877 --> 01:03:23,576
He had them write 500 times,
"I respect private property."

742
01:03:23,748 --> 01:03:26,979
Did anybody ever pay Edwards
for those broken records?

743
01:03:27,152 --> 01:03:29,484
Dadier, is that tin can
full of money yet?

744
01:03:29,654 --> 01:03:33,522
- He's lucky they don't steal the tin can.
- I'll tell you what I'll do.

745
01:03:33,692 --> 01:03:36,786
I'll rig up an electric chair
and bring it to my class.

746
01:03:36,962 --> 01:03:42,059
I'll tell my pupils it's a circuit tester. I'll
lead the little lice in the chair one by one...

747
01:03:42,234 --> 01:03:46,068
...and throw the switch on.
- They'll rig up that hot seat first...

748
01:03:46,238 --> 01:03:49,264
...throw you in it and fry you.
- I'd have clobbered them.

749
01:03:49,441 --> 01:03:50,669
- Would you?
- Sure.

750
01:03:50,842 --> 01:03:54,073
Would you? They outnumber you,
outweigh you and outreach you.

751
01:03:54,246 --> 01:03:56,578
They get hit at home
and in the streets.

752
01:03:56,748 --> 01:03:58,807
- They're used to it.
- And understand it.

753
01:03:58,984 --> 01:04:02,784
- What's that got to do with teaching?
- I never have any real trouble.

754
01:04:02,954 --> 01:04:07,288
That's right, Miss Panucci.
He's a clobberer, you're a slobberer.

755
01:04:07,459 --> 01:04:11,190
"I'm just a nice woman trying to do my job.
Now, please be nice, boys."

756
01:04:11,363 --> 01:04:15,925
You. You give them the veteran pitch.
"I got the purple heart, boys."

757
01:04:16,101 --> 01:04:20,470
You tell them about... What is it? The steel
plate in your head, the artificial leg.

758
01:04:20,639 --> 01:04:23,938
You beg for sympathy. "I'm a veteran.
Help me keep my job?"

759
01:04:24,109 --> 01:04:28,205
You don't care if they learn. He's lucky
they don't kick the artificial leg...

760
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:32,111
...out from underneath him. And you're
a slumberer. You sleepwalk.

761
01:04:32,284 --> 01:04:35,185
Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil.

762
01:04:35,353 --> 01:04:40,154
Oh, every once in a while you make
sounds like a teacher. Nobody cares.

763
01:04:40,325 --> 01:04:43,556
Nobody listens. I mean,
nobody cares, especially you.

764
01:04:43,728 --> 01:04:47,755
This man, he's a grumbler. You hate
the kids. You have contempt for them.

765
01:04:47,932 --> 01:04:51,095
- You condemn them.
- All right, what about you, Zola?

766
01:04:51,870 --> 01:04:55,271
I'm... I'm a fumbler.

767
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:59,001
- I'm not doing any better than you.
- What are we supposed to do?

768
01:04:59,177 --> 01:05:01,168
- Butt our heads on a stone wall?
- Yes.

769
01:05:01,346 --> 01:05:03,473
- With kids that don't wanna learn?
- Yes.

770
01:05:03,648 --> 01:05:06,879
- All right. How?
- I don't know how.

771
01:05:07,052 --> 01:05:09,816
I mean, there must be some way to...

772
01:05:10,555 --> 01:05:15,185
- There must be some way to reach them.
- Whom are you trying to convince?

773
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:17,453
Me or you?

774
01:05:25,036 --> 01:05:27,402
- Rotten day, ain't it?
- Hello, Mrs. Brophy.

775
01:05:27,572 --> 01:05:30,939
- You shouldn't be walking in the snow.
- I like it.

776
01:05:31,109 --> 01:05:35,739
If I had a condition, I'd be carried like a
Chinese pagoda. Where'd you go, movies?

777
01:05:35,914 --> 01:05:39,372
It's funny, habits. In the morning
when my husband goes to work...

778
01:05:39,551 --> 01:05:43,920
...click, I turn on the radio. Nothing but
serials. In one ear and out the other.

779
01:05:44,089 --> 01:05:45,681
One day the radio breaks down.

780
01:05:48,093 --> 01:05:51,221
It was quiet. I thought I'd go crazy.
Stark-naked crazy.

781
01:05:54,132 --> 01:05:57,693
Your husband ain't home yet.
I stopped in just now.

782
01:05:57,869 --> 01:06:01,202
- I loaned a little rum for cooking, you know.
- What time is it?

783
01:06:01,373 --> 01:06:05,503
Let me see, it's a little bit after 5.
I don't care for liquor, personally...

784
01:06:05,677 --> 01:06:08,407
...but my old man, he goes for it
in a great way.

785
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:12,516
You shouldn't be walking
in the snow, Mrs. Dadier.

786
01:06:43,214 --> 01:06:44,977
Anne?

787
01:06:49,187 --> 01:06:50,745
Anne?

788
01:06:50,922 --> 01:06:53,015
Oh, I thought it was you.

789
01:06:53,992 --> 01:06:56,961
- Is something wrong?
- No, no.

790
01:06:57,128 --> 01:07:00,620
No, it was late. You weren't home.
I got lonely.

791
01:07:00,799 --> 01:07:02,164
Sorry I was late.

792
01:07:02,333 --> 01:07:04,824
What's a teacher do when he stays
after school?

793
01:07:05,003 --> 01:07:06,766
Or is it ethical to tell?

794
01:07:06,938 --> 01:07:08,906
Josh Edwards quit his job today.

795
01:07:09,073 --> 01:07:13,737
I was helping him straighten his desk out.
I tried to get him to change his mind, but...

796
01:07:13,912 --> 01:07:15,174
He was right to quit.

797
01:07:15,346 --> 01:07:18,645
And if you had any sense,
you'd get out of this place too...

798
01:07:18,817 --> 01:07:20,751
...before it's too late.

799
01:07:20,919 --> 01:07:22,284
What would I do?

800
01:07:22,454 --> 01:07:24,649
Sell shoelaces? Run for president?

801
01:07:24,823 --> 01:07:27,917
You'd teach in a decent place,
where kids wanna learn.

802
01:07:28,092 --> 01:07:30,617
Where a teacher's respected.

803
01:07:31,896 --> 01:07:34,364
I wrote to Professor Kraal.

804
01:07:34,899 --> 01:07:37,094
Here's his answer.

805
01:07:37,268 --> 01:07:40,032
He says he can get you
a job in his school.

806
01:07:40,205 --> 01:07:42,400
Tell him yes, Rick.

807
01:07:42,574 --> 01:07:45,042
Maybe. We'll see.

808
01:07:45,210 --> 01:07:48,805
- What's so important about this place?
- It's a challenge.

809
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:50,914
What else is it?

810
01:07:51,716 --> 01:07:53,206
You wanna stay.

811
01:07:53,384 --> 01:07:56,444
- You wanna stay in this filthy, miserable...
- Wait a minute.

812
01:07:56,621 --> 01:08:00,557
Come on, now. Hold it. You got
enough troubles without me, you know.

813
01:08:02,060 --> 01:08:04,085
Have I told you today that I love you?

814
01:08:04,262 --> 01:08:05,820
- Have I?
- Do you?

815
01:08:05,997 --> 01:08:07,589
What do you think?

816
01:08:07,765 --> 01:08:10,859
I'm selfish. I wanna be told.

817
01:08:11,035 --> 01:08:15,028
Let's splurge and take a taxi home.

818
01:08:15,206 --> 01:08:17,470
We'll neck in the back seat.
How about that?

819
01:08:17,642 --> 01:08:18,870
All right.

820
01:08:19,043 --> 01:08:20,704
Taxi!

821
01:09:31,950 --> 01:09:34,646
No, man. This ain't no jam session.

822
01:09:34,819 --> 01:09:36,684
Stop jazzing it up, okay?

823
01:09:36,854 --> 01:09:39,618
All right. Let's pick it up
with "Go Down, Moses."

824
01:10:10,888 --> 01:10:13,083
Sounded real nice.

825
01:10:13,257 --> 01:10:15,885
Fair, chief. It'll get better.

826
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:20,019
Cut out, fellas. I'll see you later.

827
01:10:20,198 --> 01:10:24,032
If you're wondering, we didn't break in.
Mr. Halloran loaned us the hall.

828
01:10:24,202 --> 01:10:26,864
No, no. I was just wondering if...

829
01:10:27,038 --> 01:10:30,030
If maybe we'd play a spot
on your Christmas show?

830
01:10:30,208 --> 01:10:32,972
- Yeah.
- I figured.

831
01:10:33,645 --> 01:10:34,873
Would you?

832
01:10:35,046 --> 01:10:38,038
That's why we've been rehearsing,
Mr. Dadier.

833
01:10:38,783 --> 01:10:41,843
Where'd you learn
to play the piano this way?

834
01:10:42,353 --> 01:10:44,048
Picked it up.

835
01:10:47,992 --> 01:10:49,823
What are the rules, Miller?

836
01:10:49,994 --> 01:10:51,518
- Rules?
- Yeah. What are they?

837
01:10:51,696 --> 01:10:54,563
I mean, you can be so cooperative
on a thing like this.

838
01:10:54,732 --> 01:10:56,962
In my classroom, I...

839
01:10:57,135 --> 01:11:01,663
You better get a move on, teach.
You'll be late for your own class.

840
01:11:04,409 --> 01:11:06,172
Wanna walk up with me?

841
01:11:06,344 --> 01:11:08,209
I'll be along.

842
01:11:11,549 --> 01:11:13,039
Yeah.

843
01:11:25,263 --> 01:11:27,390
<i>Help!</i>

844
01:11:27,565 --> 01:11:31,057
<i>Master! Master!</i>

845
01:11:31,235 --> 01:11:33,100
<i>Hey!</i>

846
01:11:40,712 --> 01:11:42,373
He's tough.

847
01:11:48,453 --> 01:11:49,943
<i>Jack ran for the beanstalk.</i>

848
01:11:50,121 --> 01:11:52,612
<i>But the giant was close behind him.</i>

849
01:12:20,284 --> 01:12:23,583
<i>So Jack got rich. And when he grew up,</i>
<i>he married a princess.</i>

850
01:12:23,755 --> 01:12:26,918
<i>And they lived happily forever after.</i>

851
01:12:37,268 --> 01:12:41,295
- Teach, how about the main feature?
- Marilyn Monroe, hey?

852
01:12:41,472 --> 01:12:42,871
Humphrey Bogart.

853
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:46,498
- What'd you think of the story?
- It was lousy. There was no dames.

854
01:12:46,677 --> 01:12:50,078
- Miller, what did you think?
- This Jack, he's a pretty cool cat.

855
01:12:50,248 --> 01:12:52,478
I don't like fairy stories, you know?

856
01:12:52,650 --> 01:12:55,676
- Speranza?
- I don't know. I felt sorry for the giant.

857
01:12:55,853 --> 01:12:57,411
Oh? Why's that?

858
01:12:57,588 --> 01:13:01,285
Well, this Jack, he ain't no hero.
He's a pretty dumb hick.

859
01:13:01,459 --> 01:13:04,223
Yeah, look. His old lady
sends him out to sell a cow.

860
01:13:04,395 --> 01:13:06,454
Jack the jerk meets up
with a con man...

861
01:13:06,631 --> 01:13:09,429
...and let him have the cow
for a couple of beans.

862
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:12,194
- That wasn't smart.
- He climbed that beanstalk...

863
01:13:12,370 --> 01:13:16,534
...until he disappeared in another land.
- Without a space helmet, man.

864
01:13:16,707 --> 01:13:19,107
How'd that giant get up
without any beanstalk?

865
01:13:19,277 --> 01:13:21,302
This is a fairy story. He just flew.

866
01:13:21,479 --> 01:13:25,210
- I got this Jack pegged for a thief.
- The giant was supposed to kill...

867
01:13:25,383 --> 01:13:27,351
...Jack's father and stole his money.

868
01:13:27,518 --> 01:13:30,112
- How'd Jack know?
- It was supposed Jack thought...

869
01:13:30,288 --> 01:13:34,486
...that the giant stole from him. Did that
give Jack the right to steal the hen?

870
01:13:34,659 --> 01:13:37,253
- No, he's gotta have proof.
- Suppose he had proof.

871
01:13:37,428 --> 01:13:41,694
- Jack, he should've called the cops.
- Yeah, and the cops would've kept the loot.

872
01:13:41,866 --> 01:13:45,131
- Could be.
- Not the FBI.

873
01:13:45,603 --> 01:13:48,265
And that magic harp.

874
01:13:48,606 --> 01:13:52,542
If the giant would've been so bad,
the harp would've wanted to be snatched.

875
01:13:52,710 --> 01:13:55,270
- Could be.
- Why do you suppose that magic harp...

876
01:13:55,446 --> 01:13:59,280
...liked that giant so much?
- I know. Because the giant, he liked music.

877
01:13:59,450 --> 01:14:02,613
Jack was a heist man. He got away
with burglary three times.

878
01:14:02,787 --> 01:14:05,278
I liked the part where
he knocked off the giant.

879
01:14:05,456 --> 01:14:08,948
Who cares? The whole thing here's
a phony.

880
01:14:09,894 --> 01:14:13,728
- You think Jack should've killed the giant?
- Yeah. He was chasing him.

881
01:14:13,898 --> 01:14:16,560
If somebody stole from you,
wouldn't you chase him?

882
01:14:16,734 --> 01:14:19,396
The way I got it figured,
this Jack, he's a square.

883
01:14:19,637 --> 01:14:22,663
First off, he don't care
if his old lady starves to death.

884
01:14:22,840 --> 01:14:25,172
Then he sells the cow
for a handful of beans.

885
01:14:25,343 --> 01:14:27,834
- Then he turned burglar.
- Then he commit murder.

886
01:14:28,012 --> 01:14:30,947
- And for all of this, he gets a reward.
- He's rich.

887
01:14:31,115 --> 01:14:33,083
- He marries a princess.
- You know why?

888
01:14:33,251 --> 01:14:36,152
Because he took what he wanted.
Crime always pays.

889
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:37,844
- But it was a crime.
- So what?

890
01:14:38,022 --> 01:14:41,014
- It was only some giant.
- Why don't you like the giant?

891
01:14:41,192 --> 01:14:43,683
- Because he's a giant.
- You're a Dodger fan.

892
01:14:43,861 --> 01:14:48,093
No kidding, fellas. I mean, you don't like
the giant because he's different.

893
01:14:48,266 --> 01:14:49,995
- That's right.
- But is that right?

894
01:14:50,167 --> 01:14:53,466
I mean, is it right to dislike somebody
because he's different?

895
01:14:53,638 --> 01:14:57,233
I mean, there's a lot of us here
in this classroom who are different.

896
01:14:57,408 --> 01:14:59,740
If the story's so cockeyed,
what's the point?

897
01:14:59,911 --> 01:15:01,378
Now we're getting somewhere.

898
01:15:01,545 --> 01:15:05,140
All your lives, you're gonna hear stories,
what some guy tells you...

899
01:15:05,316 --> 01:15:08,945
...what you see in books, magazines.
What you read in the newspapers.

900
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:11,588
But if you can just examine the story...

901
01:15:11,756 --> 01:15:13,383
...look for the real meaning...

902
01:15:13,557 --> 01:15:16,492
...and most of all, just learn
to think for yourselves...

903
01:15:16,661 --> 01:15:19,687
Here it comes.
Here comes the commercial.

904
01:15:21,065 --> 01:15:24,592
That giant, if he done wrong...

905
01:15:24,769 --> 01:15:27,397
...least I think he should've had a trial.

906
01:15:27,571 --> 01:15:31,302
- Teach, how about some more stories?
- Yeah, a story about football.

907
01:15:31,475 --> 01:15:34,672
Hey, teach. Maybe I'll turn out to be
a critic on the movies.

908
01:15:34,845 --> 01:15:38,303
How did you like Jack and the Beanstalk?
Turned out to be a thief.

909
01:15:38,482 --> 01:15:40,416
I liked the story.

910
01:15:44,155 --> 01:15:47,591
- So you finally got through to them.
- I think so.

911
01:15:47,758 --> 01:15:49,555
Yes. For once, for the first time.

912
01:15:49,727 --> 01:15:51,786
What's the answer?
Visual education?

913
01:15:51,963 --> 01:15:54,523
Yeah, partly. If you
just get them stimulated...

914
01:15:54,732 --> 01:15:57,826
They'll go for movies, but will that
teach them to read?

915
01:15:58,002 --> 01:16:01,665
No, but if you can get them to use
their imagination, to reach out.

916
01:16:01,839 --> 01:16:04,706
But certainly not knowledge.

917
01:16:04,875 --> 01:16:08,572
If they use their intelligence,
get their minds out of comic books...

918
01:16:09,213 --> 01:16:11,841
A mind would indicate a brain,
and a brain...

919
01:16:12,016 --> 01:16:14,746
Before he proves Darwin was right,
I've got a class.

920
01:16:14,919 --> 01:16:17,888
If you still need a Santa Claus
for your Christmas show...

921
01:16:18,055 --> 01:16:20,649
- Yeah, I do.
- Well, you got one.

922
01:17:03,768 --> 01:17:06,362
- Hello?
<i>- Your husband won't be home tonight.</i>

923
01:17:06,537 --> 01:17:08,869
<i>He's gonna be with her.</i>

924
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:11,270
Who is this?

925
01:17:11,442 --> 01:17:13,069
Hello.

926
01:17:13,244 --> 01:17:14,905
Hello.

927
01:17:20,284 --> 01:17:23,651
All right. Move in a little bit, fellas.
Just a little closer.

928
01:17:23,821 --> 01:17:26,312
Now, will you hit them
with the spot here.

929
01:17:26,757 --> 01:17:29,988
Wait a minute. I can't see.
Will you turn the footlights out.

930
01:17:30,161 --> 01:17:32,959
Now, raise it up. I just wanna
catch their faces.

931
01:17:33,130 --> 01:17:34,358
Up... That's it.

932
01:17:34,532 --> 01:17:36,295
All right, remember that effect.

933
01:17:36,467 --> 01:17:38,765
All right, fellas. Give me the work light.

934
01:17:38,936 --> 01:17:40,426
Miller.

935
01:17:40,604 --> 01:17:44,165
Stick around, Miller, will you?
I wanna talk to you about an encore.

936
01:17:44,375 --> 01:17:47,105
I'm gonna go. I'm bushed.

937
01:17:47,278 --> 01:17:49,508
- Thanks for staying.
- It's shaping up okay.

938
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:51,978
Isn't it always quiet
before an earthquake?

939
01:17:52,149 --> 01:17:54,617
Good night, before he
has them burn the school.

940
01:17:54,785 --> 01:17:57,253
- Well, now that you mention it...
- Good night.

941
01:17:57,421 --> 01:18:01,915
Well, could I be wrong, have you got
these wild animals trained?

942
01:18:02,093 --> 01:18:03,924
No, not trained.

943
01:18:04,095 --> 01:18:05,722
Just interested.

944
01:18:05,896 --> 01:18:09,457
Don't forget your history.
Never turn your back.

945
01:18:09,633 --> 01:18:12,466
- Good night.
- Good night.

946
01:18:14,672 --> 01:18:18,039
- You coming?
- I've a little more work to do.

947
01:18:24,448 --> 01:18:27,849
- Need me for anything else, Mr. Director?
- No, thanks.

948
01:18:28,018 --> 01:18:29,849
That's too bad.

949
01:18:30,554 --> 01:18:33,955
- I mean, the costumes are fine, Lois.
- I know what you mean.

950
01:18:34,125 --> 01:18:36,184
That's why it's too bad.

951
01:18:37,928 --> 01:18:39,259
Look, Lois...

952
01:18:40,264 --> 01:18:44,598
...you're tired.
- No, not tired. Just bored.

953
01:18:44,768 --> 01:18:47,601
Just good and bored. You know...

954
01:18:47,771 --> 01:18:51,707
...maybe I shouldn't have transferred
to this school. Maybe I should've...

955
01:18:51,876 --> 01:18:55,277
Tell me, Rick. Don't you ever get
fed up with this place?

956
01:18:55,446 --> 01:18:57,414
Don't you ever get tired of teaching?

957
01:18:57,581 --> 01:18:59,845
Don't you wanna
throw your briefcase away...

958
01:19:00,017 --> 01:19:03,544
...and take a flyer someplace, anyplace?
With me, maybe.

959
01:19:04,388 --> 01:19:05,753
Don't you?

960
01:19:05,923 --> 01:19:07,686
Don't you, Rick?

961
01:19:10,794 --> 01:19:12,625
I guess not.

962
01:19:12,796 --> 01:19:16,459
You'd like to all right,
but you're married.

963
01:19:17,601 --> 01:19:20,536
You're married, and I'm bored.

964
01:19:20,704 --> 01:19:23,639
You're afraid, and I'm choosy.

965
01:19:23,807 --> 01:19:26,207
And you can't be choosy,
or you'll live alone.

966
01:19:26,544 --> 01:19:29,274
Keep thinking that,
you're gonna end up in trouble.

967
01:19:29,713 --> 01:19:32,204
- Mr. Dadier?
- I'll be right with you, Miller.

968
01:19:32,383 --> 01:19:33,975
I gotta get to my job.

969
01:19:39,857 --> 01:19:41,552
Good night, Lois.

970
01:19:58,442 --> 01:20:01,104
- Darling?
<i>- Your husband is with her right now.</i>

971
01:20:01,278 --> 01:20:04,213
- Stop it.
<i>- He'll tell you he was rehearsing his show.</i>

972
01:20:04,381 --> 01:20:07,612
- Please, please don't call anymore.
<i>- But he's with her.</i>

973
01:20:07,785 --> 01:20:10,083
Would you please leave me alone?

974
01:20:10,254 --> 01:20:13,052
Please leave me alone.

975
01:20:19,096 --> 01:20:22,497
- I don't need no more school.
- Why? Why, Miller?

976
01:20:22,666 --> 01:20:24,793
So, what's wrong with being a mechanic?

977
01:20:24,969 --> 01:20:29,702
- You don't want to be, do you?
- Well, there ain't much choice, is there?

978
01:20:29,873 --> 01:20:32,205
The same reason I live
in this neighborhood.

979
01:20:32,376 --> 01:20:35,345
Colored neighborhood, Mr. Dadier.
And folks don't care...

980
01:20:35,512 --> 01:20:40,040
...who fix up their car, black or white.
Just so long as it's fixed good.

981
01:20:41,852 --> 01:20:45,117
- You're late, boy.
- Yeah. I'll be early tomorrow night.

982
01:20:45,289 --> 01:20:48,690
This one needs a new set of spark plugs.
They'll pick it up at 9.

983
01:20:48,859 --> 01:20:51,521
Okay.

984
01:20:51,695 --> 01:20:53,925
You think we got a good school,
Mr. Dadier?

985
01:20:54,098 --> 01:20:56,396
- Yes.
- Do you really think that?

986
01:20:56,567 --> 01:20:59,365
The important thing is,
do you want to learn?

987
01:20:59,536 --> 01:21:03,370
In the beginning I tried, real hard.

988
01:21:03,540 --> 01:21:05,064
But what's the use?

989
01:21:05,242 --> 01:21:07,210
Nobody gives a hoot.

990
01:21:07,378 --> 01:21:12,714
Not the other fellas. Not the teachers.
And not my folks even.

991
01:21:13,417 --> 01:21:15,749
So you quit trying, huh?

992
01:21:15,919 --> 01:21:19,616
- Well, that's the easy way out, Miller.
- That's the only way.

993
01:21:19,790 --> 01:21:21,690
Sometimes we gotta do what's best...

994
01:21:21,859 --> 01:21:24,555
...even though that might be
the more difficult way.

995
01:21:24,728 --> 01:21:27,856
We talking from different sides
of the fence, Mr. Dadier.

996
01:21:28,032 --> 01:21:30,728
- You're not black.
- That's not a good enough excuse.

997
01:21:30,901 --> 01:21:33,199
Not nowadays.
Dr. Ralph Bunche proved that.

998
01:21:33,370 --> 01:21:36,134
George Washington Carver,
Marian Anderson, Joe Louis.

999
01:21:36,307 --> 01:21:40,243
- So?
- So I don't want you to quit, that's all.

1000
01:21:40,411 --> 01:21:42,971
Now, you'll be of age
the end of this term.

1001
01:21:43,814 --> 01:21:47,716
- Don't give up trying. Don't quit.
- Mr. Dadier, you pretty new at this.

1002
01:21:47,885 --> 01:21:51,184
- You gonna be quitting yourself.
- I'll make a deal with you.

1003
01:21:51,355 --> 01:21:55,189
We'll have a pact, you and I.
Neither of us quit. How about it?

1004
01:21:58,095 --> 01:22:01,690
Say, you know, that wasn't true
what you said about teachers.

1005
01:22:01,865 --> 01:22:04,356
Some of us do care, you know.

1006
01:22:06,036 --> 01:22:08,561
- Good night.
- Good night.

1007
01:22:16,013 --> 01:22:19,574
They took her to the hospital.
Emergency. I just dropped in.

1008
01:22:19,750 --> 01:22:21,650
- What happened?
- Your missus, I mean.

1009
01:22:21,819 --> 01:22:24,754
She started to have terrible pains.
Just terrible.

1010
01:22:24,922 --> 01:22:29,222
Seven months. Don't worry, Mr. Dadier.
I'll bring her things.

1011
01:22:35,132 --> 01:22:38,431
- Been here long?
- Yes, quite a while.

1012
01:22:45,275 --> 01:22:46,970
Is she gonna be all right?

1013
01:22:47,144 --> 01:22:50,375
- She's trying, Mr. Dadier.
- Are you sure of that?

1014
01:22:50,547 --> 01:22:53,778
Yes, your wife is fine. She just had a boy.

1015
01:22:53,951 --> 01:22:55,816
Well, what do you mean, "had"?

1016
01:22:55,986 --> 01:22:57,851
Well, he's still in danger.

1017
01:22:58,021 --> 01:23:00,751
- I don't understand.
- The baby was premature.

1018
01:23:00,924 --> 01:23:02,949
That together with...

1019
01:23:03,127 --> 01:23:06,096
What was your wife worried about?
She seemed disturbed...

1020
01:23:06,263 --> 01:23:07,855
...she wouldn't talk about it.

1021
01:23:08,031 --> 01:23:10,693
- She lost a baby once...
- No, no. I know about that.

1022
01:23:10,868 --> 01:23:12,802
No, this was something secret.

1023
01:23:12,970 --> 01:23:16,462
There was no trouble between
you and your wife, Mr. Dadier?

1024
01:23:16,640 --> 01:23:18,335
I'm sorry.

1025
01:23:20,911 --> 01:23:22,776
Is the baby gonna live?

1026
01:23:22,946 --> 01:23:26,473
I don't know. Three or four days
should tell us that.

1027
01:23:26,650 --> 01:23:32,179
Does Anne..? I mean, have you
told Anne about the baby yet?

1028
01:23:32,356 --> 01:23:33,618
Mind if I see her?

1029
01:23:33,791 --> 01:23:38,251
Well, she's still in a twilight condition,
not fully awake or fully asleep, but...

1030
01:23:39,463 --> 01:23:42,227
- All right, you can see her.
- Thank you.

1031
01:23:42,399 --> 01:23:43,923
Arthur?

1032
01:24:05,956 --> 01:24:08,424
- Hi.
- Hi.

1033
01:24:09,526 --> 01:24:12,359
You..? Are you all right?

1034
01:24:12,529 --> 01:24:14,497
I'm tired.

1035
01:24:14,665 --> 01:24:17,225
Just awfully tired.

1036
01:24:17,835 --> 01:24:20,326
I think I could sleep for a week.

1037
01:24:20,504 --> 01:24:24,838
Yeah, well, look, honey,
you try and get some sleep.

1038
01:24:26,243 --> 01:24:29,804
Don't go. Not yet.

1039
01:24:29,980 --> 01:24:32,642
Wait until they chase you.

1040
01:24:36,019 --> 01:24:38,510
It happened kind of suddenly.

1041
01:24:39,957 --> 01:24:42,926
We made it this time, didn't we?

1042
01:24:44,027 --> 01:24:45,426
Yeah.

1043
01:24:47,297 --> 01:24:49,959
Have you seen the baby yet?

1044
01:24:52,369 --> 01:24:54,564
No. No, I haven't.

1045
01:24:54,738 --> 01:24:57,832
It's a boy. Isn't it?

1046
01:24:59,376 --> 01:25:00,843
Yeah.

1047
01:25:02,446 --> 01:25:05,882
- Happy, Rick?
- Yeah.

1048
01:25:06,049 --> 01:25:07,846
Sure am.

1049
01:25:08,018 --> 01:25:10,179
You still love me?

1050
01:25:11,288 --> 01:25:13,153
Oh, Anne, I love you.

1051
01:25:13,323 --> 01:25:16,781
You know, I love you very, very much.

1052
01:25:17,828 --> 01:25:20,228
- I brought things for Mrs. Dadier.
- Thank you.

1053
01:25:20,397 --> 01:25:23,491
Oh, Mrs. Brophy. Thanks a lot
for all your trouble.

1054
01:25:23,667 --> 01:25:26,067
Trouble, what do you men
know about trouble?

1055
01:25:26,236 --> 01:25:29,034
I found these letters.
I guess she was reading them...

1056
01:25:29,206 --> 01:25:32,369
...when the pains started.
I don't understand you, mister.

1057
01:25:32,543 --> 01:25:35,205
I just don't understand you.

1058
01:25:55,933 --> 01:25:59,733
It's a necktie. A gift from the kids.

1059
01:26:00,304 --> 01:26:02,295
Merry Christmas.

1060
01:26:02,472 --> 01:26:06,067
The kids were only trying to show
their appreciation of what you did.

1061
01:26:06,243 --> 01:26:10,441
Yeah, well, I'd like to give them something
for what they did to me.

1062
01:26:10,948 --> 01:26:14,179
The show was a success.
Miller and his boys sang beautifully.

1063
01:26:14,351 --> 01:26:18,014
I don't wanna hear about it, Jim.
I don't wanna hear about the show...

1064
01:26:18,188 --> 01:26:21,157
...about the school, about anything.
Because I'm through.

1065
01:26:21,325 --> 01:26:24,123
I'm finished, I'm quitting.
As far as I'm concerned...

1066
01:26:24,294 --> 01:26:27,593
...that school is just dead.
What was it you called it?

1067
01:26:27,764 --> 01:26:30,824
Was it a great, big garbage can?

1068
01:26:31,001 --> 01:26:33,265
Yeah? Oh, man. How right you were.

1069
01:26:33,437 --> 01:26:36,736
Well, I've had it right up to here.

1070
01:26:36,907 --> 01:26:38,898
I'm quitting, I'm getting another job.

1071
01:26:39,076 --> 01:26:41,601
Ten miles and 3000 delinquents
away from here.

1072
01:26:41,778 --> 01:26:44,838
No, no. I was the one that was wrong.
You proved something.

1073
01:26:45,015 --> 01:26:48,473
The kids in our school can be taught
if you don't stop trying.

1074
01:26:48,652 --> 01:26:50,813
You got through to them.

1075
01:26:50,988 --> 01:26:54,856
And those kids, when they came
into my class, a little of your momentum...

1076
01:26:55,025 --> 01:26:59,394
...carried over, and all of a sudden,
I wanted to get through to them too.

1077
01:26:59,563 --> 01:27:02,327
Hey, that was a big day for me.

1078
01:27:02,499 --> 01:27:06,094
- If I could have two days a week...
- You can have it. You can have it.

1079
01:27:06,269 --> 01:27:09,295
Remember what you told me:
Don't turn your back on it.

1080
01:27:09,473 --> 01:27:13,204
If you quit here, you'll quit
at the next school. You'll quit teaching.

1081
01:27:13,377 --> 01:27:17,473
So what? Who cares, Jim? Who cares?
You think the kids care?

1082
01:27:17,648 --> 01:27:22,779
Their parents care?
Who cares about teachers anyhow?

1083
01:27:22,953 --> 01:27:25,012
I wanna show you something
I wrote down.

1084
01:27:25,188 --> 01:27:28,248
Now, just listen to this.
Teachers get $2 an hour, right?

1085
01:27:28,425 --> 01:27:31,519
Now, listen. A congressman and a judge
are $9.25 an hour.

1086
01:27:31,695 --> 01:27:34,562
Policemen and firemen, $2.75.
Carpenter, 2.81.

1087
01:27:34,731 --> 01:27:36,460
Plumber, 2.97. Plasterer, 3.21.

1088
01:27:36,633 --> 01:27:40,797
A household cook gets more money
than we do, and they get room and board.

1089
01:27:40,971 --> 01:27:45,635
Oh, yes, I know, a teacher, they get
as much as a babysitter or a soda jerk.

1090
01:27:48,045 --> 01:27:50,878
Two dollars an hour for a teacher.

1091
01:27:51,048 --> 01:27:53,676
<i>We take you now to Times Square</i>
<i>in New York.</i>

1092
01:27:53,850 --> 01:27:56,842
<i>In a few moments, the New Year</i>
<i>will be officially born.</i>

1093
01:27:57,020 --> 01:27:59,386
<i>Come in, Times Square.</i>

1094
01:28:05,128 --> 01:28:06,652
Hi.

1095
01:28:09,266 --> 01:28:10,961
Thank you.

1096
01:28:15,338 --> 01:28:18,671
- You feeling all right?
- Now that you're here.

1097
01:28:21,111 --> 01:28:23,409
- What's the matter?
- What? Nothing.

1098
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:26,014
Is it about the baby?

1099
01:28:26,183 --> 01:28:31,553
No, I didn't see the doctor, Anne.
He... He was busy.

1100
01:28:31,722 --> 01:28:34,156
<i>Happy New Year!</i>

1101
01:28:43,467 --> 01:28:45,935
I'm scared, Anne.

1102
01:28:46,103 --> 01:28:48,298
I'm really scared.

1103
01:28:49,306 --> 01:28:51,001
What if the baby doesn't live?

1104
01:28:51,174 --> 01:28:54,701
- He will. I know he will.
- Yeah, but what if he doesn't?

1105
01:28:57,314 --> 01:28:59,680
You know, I wanted that baby.

1106
01:29:00,317 --> 01:29:03,616
I needed that baby
just as much as you did.

1107
01:29:05,388 --> 01:29:10,223
And all my life, I wanted to teach kids.

1108
01:29:10,861 --> 01:29:15,730
And my son was gonna...
He was gonna kind of help me out.

1109
01:29:15,899 --> 01:29:18,561
Through him, maybe I'd learn
to understand.

1110
01:29:18,735 --> 01:29:20,225
Rick.

1111
01:29:21,438 --> 01:29:24,839
No matter what happens, I love you.

1112
01:29:25,509 --> 01:29:28,808
I was silly and vain and selfish,
so I doubted you.

1113
01:29:28,979 --> 01:29:31,539
I was like one of the bad kids
in your class.

1114
01:29:31,715 --> 01:29:34,206
Somebody told me a lie,
and I believed that lie.

1115
01:29:34,384 --> 01:29:36,818
- One's as bad as the other.
- I wanna tell you...

1116
01:29:36,987 --> 01:29:40,081
I was wrong about something else too.

1117
01:29:40,257 --> 01:29:43,590
I wanted you to quit teaching
in that school.

1118
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:46,194
I understand now why
you wanted to keep trying.

1119
01:29:46,363 --> 01:29:48,160
- Please.
- I'm glad you didn't quit.

1120
01:29:48,331 --> 01:29:49,992
Now, wait a minute.

1121
01:29:50,167 --> 01:29:53,034
Honey, kids are people.

1122
01:29:53,203 --> 01:29:55,671
And most people are worthwhile.

1123
01:29:55,839 --> 01:29:57,932
We all need the same thing.

1124
01:29:58,108 --> 01:30:01,441
Patience, understanding...

1125
01:30:01,611 --> 01:30:03,078
...love.

1126
01:30:03,547 --> 01:30:08,075
You've got that to give them, darling.
And that's why you'll get through to them.

1127
01:30:15,192 --> 01:30:17,319
Your son's out of danger.

1128
01:30:17,494 --> 01:30:18,756
He's gonna make it.

1129
01:30:28,672 --> 01:30:30,606
Happy New Year, Mr. And Mrs. Dadier.

1130
01:30:40,116 --> 01:30:44,314
Now, pretty soon, you're gonna be reading
in the newspapers want ads for jobs...

1131
01:30:44,487 --> 01:30:46,682
...apartments, something to buy.

1132
01:30:46,857 --> 01:30:49,951
Advertising space is expensive,
so abbreviations are used.

1133
01:30:50,126 --> 01:30:54,062
Write out the complete words to all
the abbreviations in these problem ads.

1134
01:30:54,231 --> 01:30:55,926
All right, get started.

1135
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:06,308
Belazi. Let's keep your eyes
on your own paper.

1136
01:31:06,476 --> 01:31:08,137
Me?

1137
01:31:09,546 --> 01:31:12,344
Cheating won't help you learn
those abbreviations.

1138
01:31:12,515 --> 01:31:15,177
He won't look for no job.
His old man owns a store.

1139
01:31:15,352 --> 01:31:18,412
- I'm not gonna buy no Cadillac.
- It's cheaper to steal one.

1140
01:31:18,588 --> 01:31:20,556
That's arithmetic, teach.

1141
01:31:26,429 --> 01:31:28,488
All right, Belazi.

1142
01:31:28,665 --> 01:31:30,963
Bring your paper up here.

1143
01:31:40,944 --> 01:31:43,344
Five points off. What for?

1144
01:31:43,513 --> 01:31:45,606
For having loose eyes.

1145
01:31:57,594 --> 01:32:00,654
- West.
- You talking to me, teach?

1146
01:32:02,332 --> 01:32:03,959
Bring your paper up here, West.

1147
01:32:05,068 --> 01:32:06,763
What for?

1148
01:32:09,572 --> 01:32:11,699
I said, bring your paper up here.

1149
01:32:13,410 --> 01:32:15,344
And I said, what for?

1150
01:32:15,512 --> 01:32:17,810
Come on, Artie. Bring him the paper.

1151
01:32:17,981 --> 01:32:21,508
Now, look, you just keep your
rotten mouth out of this, black boy.

1152
01:32:21,685 --> 01:32:23,346
Miller!

1153
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:25,385
Hold it.

1154
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:39,664
All right. All right, Miller.

1155
01:32:40,503 --> 01:32:42,130
It's all right.

1156
01:32:45,008 --> 01:32:47,533
Now, bring your paper up here, West.

1157
01:32:56,586 --> 01:32:59,180
All right, we're going down
to see the principal.

1158
01:32:59,656 --> 01:33:01,317
We are?

1159
01:33:01,491 --> 01:33:03,618
You gonna make me, Daddy-oh?

1160
01:33:03,793 --> 01:33:07,058
- Come on, let's go.
- How'd you like to go to hell?

1161
01:33:14,971 --> 01:33:17,235
What's the matter, Daddy-oh?

1162
01:33:19,642 --> 01:33:21,701
Yeah, how about it, teach?

1163
01:33:21,878 --> 01:33:23,971
You got a big mouth.

1164
01:33:24,147 --> 01:33:27,548
Tell me to do this, do that.

1165
01:33:27,717 --> 01:33:29,844
Are you big enough to take me
to the principal's office?

1166
01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:35,515
Because that's what you're gonna
have to do. Take me. Come on, take me!

1167
01:33:35,692 --> 01:33:37,455
Come on!

1168
01:34:06,089 --> 01:34:07,579
Come on.

1169
01:34:07,757 --> 01:34:10,385
For a bright boy, you didn't learn nothing.

1170
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:14,087
Come on. Step right up and taste
a little of this, Daddy-oh.

1171
01:34:16,599 --> 01:34:18,726
Give me that knife, West.

1172
01:34:19,469 --> 01:34:20,800
Where do you want it?

1173
01:34:20,970 --> 01:34:24,133
You want it in the belly?
Or how about in the face?

1174
01:34:25,408 --> 01:34:28,639
- Give me that knife.
- Here it is. All you gotta do is take it.

1175
01:34:28,812 --> 01:34:31,440
- Come on, take it. Come on!
- Take it easy, chief.

1176
01:34:31,614 --> 01:34:34,640
He's crazy, he's high, he's floating
on Sneaky Pete wine.

1177
01:34:34,818 --> 01:34:36,752
He's gonna kill him.

1178
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:39,278
All you gotta do is take it.

1179
01:34:39,656 --> 01:34:41,453
Come on, take it.

1180
01:34:43,593 --> 01:34:46,562
That's just what I'm gonna do, big shot.

1181
01:34:56,873 --> 01:34:58,841
Come on, West.

1182
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:05,370
Come on.

1183
01:35:07,016 --> 01:35:09,007
Come on.

1184
01:35:10,320 --> 01:35:12,015
Where you going, boy? Come on.

1185
01:35:12,188 --> 01:35:13,678
Belazi.

1186
01:35:15,658 --> 01:35:17,091
Come on.

1187
01:35:17,894 --> 01:35:19,589
Morales.

1188
01:35:25,235 --> 01:35:26,759
Stoker.

1189
01:35:27,804 --> 01:35:30,204
- Santini.
- You keep out of it.

1190
01:35:30,373 --> 01:35:33,001
You want a gang fight?
You wanna start a rumble?

1191
01:35:33,176 --> 01:35:35,201
Come on, boy, just make a move.

1192
01:35:35,845 --> 01:35:37,073
All right, you guys.

1193
01:35:39,415 --> 01:35:42,407
Bascillo, Rock, move, both!

1194
01:35:42,585 --> 01:35:45,611
What's the matter, West?
You need help?

1195
01:35:45,788 --> 01:35:48,951
Come on. You're holding
the handle of that knife.

1196
01:35:49,125 --> 01:35:51,355
Come on, you're the leader.

1197
01:35:51,528 --> 01:35:54,395
You're the tough guy.

1198
01:35:54,564 --> 01:35:56,930
You can't cut alone, huh, West?

1199
01:35:58,034 --> 01:36:02,596
You're not so tough without a gang,
but you were tough that night, weren't you?

1200
01:36:02,772 --> 01:36:05,605
Seven to two. That's about
your odds, isn't it?

1201
01:36:05,775 --> 01:36:08,141
- This time you get cut up.
- Yeah.

1202
01:36:10,113 --> 01:36:14,607
The gang-up didn't work. You went to the
principal with a story about race prejudice.

1203
01:36:14,784 --> 01:36:19,050
You couldn't get rid of me that way.
Then you started sending letters to my wife.

1204
01:36:19,222 --> 01:36:22,658
Didn't you? Didn't you, West?

1205
01:36:22,825 --> 01:36:25,259
End of the line, boy.

1206
01:36:40,510 --> 01:36:41,909
Not here.

1207
01:36:42,078 --> 01:36:43,568
Not here.

1208
01:36:43,746 --> 01:36:45,907
Not here.

1209
01:36:48,918 --> 01:36:50,613
Not here.

1210
01:36:54,357 --> 01:36:56,985
- Hey, Belazi.
- Shut up, chicken.

1211
01:36:57,160 --> 01:37:00,391
I'm getting out of here. I'm not going
to their reform school.

1212
01:37:00,563 --> 01:37:04,090
- Me, me, what about me?
- You, you're own your own.

1213
01:37:05,235 --> 01:37:08,170
Open up. You hear me? Out of the way!

1214
01:37:08,338 --> 01:37:11,205
What's the matter with you?
What do you got against me?

1215
01:37:11,374 --> 01:37:14,275
Come on, out of the way! You hear me?!

1216
01:37:18,815 --> 01:37:20,442
Morales.

1217
01:37:20,817 --> 01:37:23,047
Use it. Use it.

1218
01:37:31,394 --> 01:37:34,158
- Some cut.
- We'll take you to a doctor, teach.

1219
01:37:34,330 --> 01:37:37,925
After we take these two
down to the principal's office.

1220
01:37:44,240 --> 01:37:45,468
All right, fellas?

1221
01:37:48,444 --> 01:37:50,435
I know.

1222
01:37:50,613 --> 01:37:53,343
You're saying, "Why do that?

1223
01:37:53,516 --> 01:37:57,008
Why not forget..? Forget the whole thing."

1224
01:37:57,186 --> 01:38:00,553
No! No, no, not this time.

1225
01:38:00,723 --> 01:38:04,181
There's no place for these two
in your classroom.

1226
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:09,093
Look, we've all made a step forward this
morning. Now, there's no sliding back now.

1227
01:38:09,265 --> 01:38:11,165
Not ever again.

1228
01:38:11,901 --> 01:38:15,029
Whether you like it or not,
I'm taking these two downstairs.

1229
01:38:15,204 --> 01:38:18,264
I think maybe we'll give you a hand,
Mr. Dadier.

1230
01:38:18,441 --> 01:38:20,568
- Okay, fellas?
- Yeah.

1231
01:38:21,077 --> 01:38:22,977
- Sure.
- Yeah.

1232
01:38:26,716 --> 01:38:28,149
Boys...

1233
01:38:28,318 --> 01:38:30,343
...I think they'll go alone.

1234
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:32,886
Come on, West. Let's go.

1235
01:38:33,056 --> 01:38:35,581
Belazi. Come on!

1236
01:38:42,298 --> 01:38:44,823
- What made you change your mind?
- They did.

1237
01:38:45,001 --> 01:38:47,526
You okay, Mr. Daddy-oh, sir?

1238
01:38:47,704 --> 01:38:50,070
I think so, Santini.

1239
01:38:50,239 --> 01:38:52,002
I think so.

1240
01:38:53,209 --> 01:38:55,006
Mr. Dadier?

1241
01:38:57,880 --> 01:39:00,280
Eighty-seven cents so far.

1242
01:39:00,450 --> 01:39:03,112
Well, thanks, Miller.

1243
01:39:03,286 --> 01:39:06,278
- Thanks for everything.
- It's okay, chief.

1244
01:39:06,456 --> 01:39:11,018
There's talk of you quitting this school,
going where there's obedient boys and girls.

1245
01:39:11,194 --> 01:39:13,594
- What do you think?
- I figure it's just talk.

1246
01:39:13,763 --> 01:39:15,253
- Why?
- Well...

1247
01:39:15,431 --> 01:39:18,025
...you know the ropes around here
pretty good now.

1248
01:39:18,201 --> 01:39:20,260
It'd be a shame to waste all that.

1249
01:39:20,436 --> 01:39:23,564
I guess everybody learns something
in school. Even teachers.

1250
01:39:23,740 --> 01:39:26,436
- Yes, I guess so.
- Besides, it'd be kind of rough...

1251
01:39:26,609 --> 01:39:28,839
...breaking in somebody new.

1252
01:39:30,113 --> 01:39:32,775
Well, see you tomorrow, Mr. Dadier?

1253
01:39:32,949 --> 01:39:36,407
I thought you were quitting
at the end of the year. Is that right?

1254
01:39:36,586 --> 01:39:39,111
We have a pact, and we wouldn't
wanna break that.

1255
01:39:39,288 --> 01:39:42,052
No, I guess we wouldn't.

1256
01:39:44,327 --> 01:39:47,626
- See you around.
- I'll see you around.
