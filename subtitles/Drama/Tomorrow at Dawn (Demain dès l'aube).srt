1
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,158
<i>Suspect described as white male,
approximately 30.</i>

2
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,711
<i>Suspect about 5-11 ", medium build,
brown dark pants.</i>

3
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,998
<i>Suspect number two about 6-1, medium
build, round glasses, dark clothes.</i>

4
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:09,199
<i>Be advised, suspects are armed
and considered extremely
dangerous. Use caution.</i>

5
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,830
<i>- Hey, Earl.
- Yes, sir.</i>

6
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,195
<i>- What do ya know?
- Well...</i>

7
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,753
it's a hot goddam day.

8
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,709
I haven't felt it a bit. Been
inside with the air conditioner
blasting all day long.

9
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,678
- Oh, is that right?
- That's right.

10
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,432
Did you break for lunch
or nothin'?

11
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,876
All by myself today.
Ate my lunch out of the microwave.

12
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,549
Jesus H. Christ, Pete.

13
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,679
When you gonna learn
that microwave food will kill
you faster than a bullet?

14
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:53,356
I mean, them damn burritos
ain't good for nothin' but
a hippie... when he's high on weed.

15
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,277
- Pull me down a bottle
of that Jack, will ya?
- Yeah.

16
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,478
I think I'm gonna get
tanked tonight.

17
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,869
What's the matter?

18
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:12,191
Yep.

19
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,795
It's been one long, goddam,
hot, miserable, shit-ass, fuckin' day...

20
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:18,348
every inch of the way.

21
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,274
First off, Nadine over at Blue Chip
got sort of sick.

22
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,909
So she got that goddam Mongoloid boy
of hers workin' the grill.

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,232
I mean, that fuckin' idiot doesn't
know rat shit from Rice Krispies.

24
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,197
They eat breakfast about 9:00.

25
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,158
And I'm pukin' up
pigs in a blanket...

26
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,959
like a sick,
fuckin' dog by 10:30.

27
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,750
Isn't there a law or something against
retards serving food to the public?

28
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,115
Well... if there ain't,
there oughta be.

29
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,670
I mean, who in the hell knows
what's goin' on in the mind
of a goddam Mongoloid?

30
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,196
Nadine should've hit that boy
in the head and sold the fuckin' milk.

31
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,317
You could sue the shit
out of her, you know that?

32
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,233
That kid belongs under a circus tent,
not flippin' burgers.

33
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,199
- You could own that fuckin' place.
- Oh, shit, Pete.

34
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,714
What would I do
with that grease pit?

35
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,509
Besides, Nadine's
got a cross to bear.

36
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,876
I mean, taking care
of that... potato head.

37
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,909
I guess you heard about that shit
up in Abilene? Bank robbery?

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,355
That's all that's been
on the box all day.

39
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,273
<i>They killed some people,
didn't they?</i>

40
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,272
Yeah. Killed four Rangers,

41
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,915
three cops,

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,753
one civilian.

43
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,559
Took a lady bank teller
hostage with them.

44
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,029
Supposed to be headed for the border,
which'd bring 'em right my way.

45
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,914
If I get my hands on them crazy, sick,
fuckin' bastards, it's payback time.

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,516
I mean...
Well, we'll get 'em.

47
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,756
We'll get 'em.

48
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,274
Oh, I don't doubt it.

49
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,476
Well...

50
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,120
I gotta drain my lizard.

51
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,191
Mind if I use your commode?

52
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,191
- Knock yourself out.
- Thank you.

53
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,510
You're welcome.

54
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:23,153
- You think I'm fuckin'
playin' with you, asshole?

55
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,630
Do you want this little girl to die?
Or that little girl? Or yourself?

56
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,871
<i>Or your bosom buddy with the badge?
Now, I don't wanna do it.</i>

57
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,078
<i>But I will turn this place
into the fucking Wild Bunch if
I think you are fuckin' with me.</i>

58
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,994
- What do you want from me?
I did what you said.
- You let him use the bathroom.

59
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,152
- No store does that.
- He comes in here everyday
and we bullshit.

60
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,879
- If I told him no,
he'd know something was up.
- I want him out of here...

61
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,714
in his car and down the road or you
can change the name of this place...

62
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,234
to "Benny's World of Blood."

63
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,953
- You giving that pig signals?
- Are you kidding?
I didn't do anything!

64
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,470
- He says you were scratching.
- I wasn't scratchin'!

65
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,836
- Are you callin' him a liar?
- I'm not callin' him a liar, okay?

66
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,956
I'm simply sayin' if I was scratchin',
I don't remember scratchin'.

67
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,271
If I did scratch,
it's not signaling. It's because
I'm fuckin' scared shitless!

68
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,715
- Wait a minute.
The guy's in the bathroom.

69
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,110
Why don't I just go back there,
shoot him in the head, and we
can get the hell outta here.

70
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:26,272
Don't do that. Look. You asked me
to act natural, and I acted natural.

71
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,989
Under the circumstances, I think
I oughta get a fuckin' Academy
Award for how natural I did.

72
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,719
You asked me to get rid of him.
I'm doin' my best!

73
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,031
Well, your best better get
a hell of a lot fuckin' better,

74
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,351
- or you are gonna feel
a hell of a lot fuckin' worse.

75
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:45,272
Everybody, be cool.
You... be cool.

76
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,119
Yep. Be back at it tomorrow.

77
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,795
<i>Tonight I'm gonna sit in front of that
box and get higher than a Georgia pine.</i>

78
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,075
- How much you want
for that hooch, Pete?

79
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,993
Oh, $6.50.

80
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,914
- Jesus Christ. You buckin'
for early retirement?
- Shit, yeah.

81
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,833
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

82
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,798
- What the fuck is that about?
- He signaled the Ranger.

83
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,030
I didn't! Ya gotta
believe me! I didn't!

84
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,680
When they were talking,
he mouthed the words, "Help us."

85
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,433
- You fuckin' liar! I didn't say shit!
- Shut the hell up!

86
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,034
Hey! You stop it!

87
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,033
- What the fuck is your problem,
goddam it?
- Seth, he did it!

88
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,759
<i>You were by the beer cooler
with your back turned.</i>

89
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,638
I was by the magazines.
I could see his face!

90
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,871
And I saw him
mouth the words, "Help us."

91
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,389
Start the car.

92
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,357
- You believe me, don't you?
- Yes. Shut up.

93
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,715
<i>- And start the car.
- You believe me?</i>

94
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,031
Start the car. You know that.
Shut the fuck up and start the car.

95
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,156
<i>- Wait a minute.
- I believe you. Start the car!</i>

96
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,073
- You're not just saying that?
You do believe me?
- I believe you! Let's go!

97
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,037
<i>- That means you believe.
- Yes, I believe you!</i>

98
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,759
You should, because I'm right.

99
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,520
Richie!

100
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,955
Yeah?

101
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,033
- You okay?
- He shot me in the fucking hand!

102
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,113
- I told you he said "Help us."
- I never said "Help us"!

103
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,876
Well, that doesn't
matter now, because you got
about two fuckin' seconds to live!

104
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,515
- Richie?
- Yeah?

105
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,239
<i>When I count to three, you shoot
the bottles out from behind him.</i>

106
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,550
Oh, yeah!

107
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,108
- One...
- Fuck!

108
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,636
Two...

109
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,195
Three!

110
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,033
- What did I tell you?
What did I say to you?

111
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,315
I said, "Buy the
road map and leave."

112
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,676
- What the fuck am I supposed to
do, Seth? He recognized us.
- He didn't recognize shit.

113
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,038
Seth, I'm telling you,
the way he looked at us... you,
especially... I knew he knew.

114
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,398
Low profile! Do you understand
the meaning of the words "low profile"?

115
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,393
"Hey, Richie, how's your hand?"
"It hurts like a fuckin' son of
a bitch! Thanks for askin'."

116
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,916
<i>Let me tell you what "low profile"
is not. It is not taking girls hostage.</i>

117
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,676
<i>It is not shooting police.
It is not setting fire to a building.</i>

118
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,433
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

119
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,038
Oh, screw it!
Goddam you! Goddam you!

120
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,999
What the hell do you want?

121
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,232
What do you think I want, you mean,
old bastard? I want a fuckin' room.

122
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,878
Okay, all right.

123
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,398
Do they have cable?

124
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,550
No.

125
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,553
- Do they have the X-rated channel?
- No.

126
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,279
- Do they have a water bed?
- Nope.

127
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,989
- What do they got?
- They have four walls and a roof
and that's all we need.

128
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,833
All right, pop the trunk.
Let's do this fast.

129
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,231
Oh.

130
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,231
Don't say a word.

131
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,071
You, plant yourself in that seat.

132
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,198
- What are you gonna do with me?
- I said "plant yourself."
Plants don't talk.

133
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:42,319
<i>Now, you wanna get on my good side?
You sit still and you don't make a peep.</i>

134
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,873
- All right, how does this feel?
- How do you think...
It hurts like a son of a bitch.

135
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,110
- It's wrapped too tight. Nice and easy.
- Okay.

136
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,953
<i>All right. Okay,
I'm gonna go get the money.</i>

137
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,276
It's 6:00. What time's
it get dark around here?

138
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,273
- About 8:00.
- Good. I'm goin' to
the border, check things out.

139
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,750
<i>I'm gonna call Carlos.
Try and arrange some sort
of a rendezvous. I don't know what.</i>

140
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,717
Could you see if he could
arrange a better deal than 30%?

141
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,030
It's a standard deal.
They're not gonna change that for us.

142
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,714
- Did you even try
and negotiate with them?
- Richie,

143
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,634
these guys are not spic
firecracker salesmen from Tijuana.

144
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,474
They don't even know the meaning
of the word "barter."
You wanna stay in El Rey,

145
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,393
you give them 30% of your loot;
it's scripture.

146
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,233
So it is written, so shall it be done.
Yeah, I know, listen.

147
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:55,438
Hey, you want sanctuary, you gotta
pay the price. The price is 30%.

148
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,318
- All I'm sayin', man...
- This conversation's over.

149
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,078
Okay?

150
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,119
We need to have a talk.

151
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,270
- What's your name?
- Gloria.

152
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,148
Hello, Gloria. I'm Seth. That's my
brother Richie. Let's cut to the chase.

153
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,358
I'm gonna ask you one question,
and all I want is a yes or no answer.

154
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,351
Do you wanna live
through this?

155
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,431
- Yes.
- Good.

156
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:27,071
Rule number one:
No noise. No questions.

157
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,118
If you make a noise,

158
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,634
Mr.44 makes a noise.

159
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,439
If you ask a question,
Mr.44 answers it.

160
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:40,150
Now are you absolutely,
positively clear about rule number one?

161
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,198
- Yes.
- Rule number two:

162
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,271
You do what we say
when we say it.

163
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,193
If you don't...
see rule number one.

164
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:53,956
<i>Rule number three: Don't you ever
try and fucking run on us,</i>

165
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:59,239
'cause I got six little friends and
they can all run faster than you can.

166
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,437
Open your eyes.

167
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,516
Gloria, you hang in there,
you follow the rules,

168
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,513
and you don't fuck with us, and
you'll get out of this alive.

169
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,036
I give you my word. Okay?

170
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,191
I'll be back in a minute.

171
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,589
You wanna come over on the bed
and watch TV with me?

172
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,111
Hail!

173
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,714
Come on.

174
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,831
Come and see.

175
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,030
Take off your shoes.

176
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,276
<i> You got about...
two more hours...</i>

177
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,352
until we get into El Paso,

178
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,954
which is right next
to the border.

179
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,032
<i>- Then we'll stop at a motel.
- Stop?</i>

180
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,795
<i>- We're not actually gonna stop
at a motel, are we?
- Yeah, what for?</i>

181
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,793
We have a motorhome.
We don't wanna stay
in those roach-haven motels, do we?

182
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:06,192
- We're self-contained.
- Okay, okay.

183
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,193
Maybe I was... a little overzealous.
But gimme a break. I just bought it.

184
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,955
- How come you
wanna stop anyways, Dad?
- I'm exhausted.

185
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,794
Exhausted? Just lie in the back, Dad.
I can drive us into Mexico.

186
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,031
- I just bet you would.
Don't even think about it.

187
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,351
Besides, I wanna have...

188
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,749
just one night's sleep
in a honest to goodness bed.

189
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:31,277
<i>The beds in the home
are okay, but...</i>

190
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,828
they're not like a real bed.

191
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,310
Excuse me.
I have to use the restroom.

192
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,993
Oh, guess what? When I called
the machine to check the messages,

193
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,038
um, one of them
was from Bethel Baptist.

194
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,475
And Mr. Franklin
said that...

195
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,473
he wouldn't permanently replace you
until we came back.

196
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:03,711
<i>- And he said that...
- That's very nice of Ted.</i>

197
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,712
But I'll call him tomorrow
and tell him not to bother waiting.

198
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,757
Daddy, I didn't wanna
talk about this...

199
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,559
<i>in front of Scott
because he gets upset.</i>

200
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,029
But I just wanna know...

201
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,555
don't you believe
in God any more?

202
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,435
Not enough to be a pastor.

203
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,872
<i>Look, I know this is hard
on you kids.</i>

204
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,669
<i>After Jenny’s death, this is probably
the last thing you need, but...</i>

205
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,151
my congregation needs
spiritual leadership.

206
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,312
Well... my faith is gone.

207
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:50,315
To answer your question,
yes, I do believe in... Jesus.

208
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,188
Yes, I do believe in God.

209
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,999
But do I love Them?

210
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,911
No.

211
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,913
Well, it's just that all our lives,
you've been a pastor.

212
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,036
And then...

213
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,590
one day you're just gonna
wake up and say, "Fuck Him"?

214
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,231
I didn't say, "Fuck Him."

215
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,277
Every person who...

216
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,831
chooses the service of God as his
life's work has something in common.

217
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,310
<i>I don't care if
you're a preacher, a priest,</i>

218
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,119
a nun, a rabbi
or a Buddhist monk.

219
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,479
Many, many times during your life you'll
look at your reflection in the mirror...

220
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,630
and ask yourself,

221
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,234
"Am I a fool?"

222
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,630
<i>I'm not going through a lapse.</i>

223
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,156
What I've experienced
is closer to awakening.

224
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,316
Daddy?

225
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,233
What do you think
Mom would say?

226
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,552
Mama's got nothin' to say.
She's dead.

227
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,599
<i>This bloody crime spree started
just a week ago today.</i>

228
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,513
The oldest of the two brothers,
Seth Gecko,

229
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:08,354
<i>was serving time in Rollings,
Kansas State Penitentiary...</i>

230
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,876
for his part in the 1988
Scott City bank robbery...

231
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,394
<i>in which two law enforcement
officers lost their lives.</i>

232
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,270
It was while at the courthouse that this
man, his younger brother, Richard Gecko,

233
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,036
<i>a known armed robber and sex offender
pulled off a daring daylight escape,</i>

234
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:29,513
resulting in the death of
four Wichita law enforcement officers,
and this woman,

235
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,910
<i>Heidi Vogel, sixth grade teacher,
who was run over by the Geckos...</i>

236
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,673
during a high-speed pursuit
through downtown Wichita.

237
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,958
<i>And earlier today, during a daylight
liquor store robbery in Big Springs,</i>

238
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,237
the Gecko brothers killed
another Texas Ranger,

239
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,393
<i>Earl McGraw, and liquor store clerk,
Pete Bottoms.</i>

240
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,948
That changes the death toll to 16;

241
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:54,079
five Texas Rangers, eight police
officers, three civilians.

242
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:58,438
And one hostage, bank teller
and mother of four, Gloria Hill.

243
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:03,116
For the time being, we're very
confident that we'll apprehend
these fugitives within 48 hours.

244
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,953
The Bureau, local law enforcement
and the Texas Rangers...

245
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:10,511
have all joined in forming a dragnet
to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.

246
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,637
Is it safe to assume that because
of the death count involved...

247
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,712
and the loss of life
of law enforcement officers,

248
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:21,476
<i>that the Bureau, the Rangers
and the police force are taking
this manhunt personally?</i>

249
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:24,154
I would say that's
a very safe assumption.

250
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,830
- Shit, I was really worried.
Where the fuck you been, man?
- Sightseeing.

251
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,798
<i>- What'd you see?
- The cops.</i>

252
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,235
- Did you see the border?
- Yes, I saw the border.

253
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:51,518
- What'd the TV say?
- They're gonna apprehend us
in about 48 hours.

254
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,797
I gotta figure out a way
to get us across this goddam border.

255
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,908
The longer we stay here, our lives
ain't worth shit. Here you go.

256
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,310
<i>We gotta get our asses
into Mexico tonight.</i>

257
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,631
<i>Then Carlos is gonna meet us at
the rendezvous tomorrow morning.</i>

258
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,077
He and his boys, all of them
are gonna escort us into El Rey.

259
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,912
And...

260
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,555
- Where's the woman?
- What?

261
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,313
<i>What do you mean, what? The woman.
The fuckin' hostage.</i>

262
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,391
Richard, where is she?

263
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,271
She's in there.

264
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,874
- What the fuck is she doin' in there?
- Seth, wait a minute.

265
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,791
<i>Seth.</i>

266
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,069
Richard, what's wrong with you?

267
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:47,790
- Before you flip out, okay, let
me just explain what happened.
- Ex... Explain to me.

268
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,839
I need an explanation.
What is the matter with you?

269
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,038
There's nothing wrong with me,
brother. That woman tried to
escape and I did what I had to.

270
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,714
No, the woman wouldn't have said shit
if she had a mouth full of it.

271
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,711
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

272
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,631
- Yeah.
- After you left,

273
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,508
- she became a completely
different person.
- Yeah.

274
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:12,033
Is it me?
Is it my fault?

275
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,350
<i>- It's not your fault.
- Is this my fault?</i>

276
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:18,115
- No, it's her fault.
It's not your fault.
- Is this my fault?

277
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,430
Do you think that
this is what I am?

278
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,672
- I don't.
- This is not me. I am
a professional fucking thief.

279
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:29,038
<i>I don't kill people that I don't have
to and I don't fucking rape women.</i>

280
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,476
What you are doing...
What you are fucking doing...

281
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:36,633
What you are doing is not how it's done.
Do you understand that? Do you?

282
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,156
Just say, "Fucking yes."
Say, "Yes, Seth, I understand."

283
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,596
- Yes, Seth, I understand.
- Say it. Say, "Yes, Seth,
I fucking understand!"

284
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,752
I understand, Seth.
I fucking understand.

285
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:55,953
We'll get to Mexico,
and it's gonna be sweet rosemary
and a hundred proof liquor...

286
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:00,033
and rice and beans and none
of this shit's gonna matter.

287
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,398
<i>I can't believe he's stoppin' here.
This place is totally cruddy.</i>

288
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,278
Dad, why are we stoppin' here?

289
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,438
There's nothin' wrong
with this... place.

290
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,273
It's a flophouse.

291
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,397
It's not a flophouse.

292
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,153
It's basic and it's simple.

293
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,038
That doesn't make it
a flophouse.

294
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,793
All right. Well,
if it doesn't have a pool,

295
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,553
then we're goin' someplace else.

296
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,631
It has a bed.

297
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,473
That's all I care about.

298
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,074
Well, other places
have beds, too,

299
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,833
and they also have... a gym...

300
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,396
<i> Geez, what is
this guy's problem?</i>

301
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,710
No idea.

302
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,948
Creepy guy.

303
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,354
What?

304
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,149
<i>- Yes, I'm your
neighbor from, uh, room 11.</i>

305
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,119
<i>And I hate to disturb you,
but I'd like to ask a favor.</i>

306
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,552
I hope none of this
is disturbin' you.

307
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,396
Hi. Uh, I'm from room 11.

308
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,234
And me and my lady friend need some ice
and we don't seem to have an ice bucket.

309
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,030
If it's not too much trouble,
could I possibly borrow yours?
I'll bring it right back.

310
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,151
Sure.

311
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,071
Thank you.

312
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,075
<i>What is this?</i>

313
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,869
It's called a punch.

314
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,996
Lose the guitar.

315
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,116
What's your name?

316
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:31,033
- Jacob.
- Jacob, get up. Get on the bed.

317
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,193
<i>- If you make a wrong move,
I will shoot you in the face.
- Open your mouth.</i>

318
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,998
Wide!

319
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,955
Let's go. Let's move
the Jap over here too. Let's go.

320
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,636
So what's the story with you two?
You a couple of fags?

321
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,190
- He's my son.
- How's that happen?
You don't look Japanese.

322
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:59,397
Neither does he.
He looks Chinese.

323
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,835
Oh, ooh, well
excuse me all to hell.

324
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,356
<i>- What's this about, money?
- It's about money,
all right, but not yours.</i>

325
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,591
My brother and I, we're in a little
hot water and we need your assistance.

326
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,955
Stop!

327
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,078
Wha... What's,
um, goin' on?

328
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,913
We're having a bikini contest,
and you just won.

329
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,833
It's okay, honey.
Everything's gonna be all right.

330
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,071
Just listen to your daddy, sugar,
and you don't do anything stupid.

331
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,754
You two, Simon says
sit the fuck down.

332
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,035
Sit down.

333
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,837
Now... where are the keys
to the motorhome?

334
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,593
- On the dresser.
- Good. All right,

335
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:44,276
Richie, you take these keys,
you start this big bastard up
and drive it up front.

336
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:52,995
Richie, would you do me a favor
and eat my pussy for me? Please?

337
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:57,278
- Uh... sure.
- Richie, hey!

338
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,316
Not when you get
around to it. Now.

339
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,509
You, Gidget, go in the bathroom
and put on some clothes.

340
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,557
You got three minutes. One second
longer, I shoot your father in the face.

341
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,676
- Do you understand what I just said?
- Yes.

342
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,591
- Do you believe me?
- Yes.

343
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,274
You damn well better. Go.

344
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,670
Look, if you want
the motorhome,

345
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,671
just take it and get out.

346
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:49,038
It's not gonna be that easy, Pops.
We're gonna go on a little ride.

347
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,956
Not a chance.

348
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,229
- Come again?
- If you're takin' people, take me.

349
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,750
<i>But my kids aren't
going anywhere with you.</i>

350
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,877
Sorry, Pops.
I need everybody.

351
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,270
My children are not goin'
with you, and that's that.

352
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,955
That's not fucking that.
This is fucking this.

353
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,110
Dad.

354
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,154
You sit down. Sit down.

355
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,516
<i>You, go sit over there.
Go sit over there, now. Move it.</i>

356
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,160
Sit down.

357
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,829
Now, I don't have time to fuck around,
so I'm gonna make this simple.

358
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,593
<i>You take your kids
and you get in that motorhome...</i>

359
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,717
or I will execute
all three of you right now.

360
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,509
<i>So, what's it gonna be?</i>

361
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,194
Yes or no answer.

362
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,475
Yes.

363
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:51,472
Hey, your old man's all right.
He just saved your life.

364
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,193
Time's up, princess.
Here we go.

365
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,393
Okay, ramblers,
let's get rambling.

366
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,916
Excuse me.

367
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,991
What?

368
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,677
- Where are you takin' us?
- Mexico.

369
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,149
What's in Mexico?

370
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,435
Mexicans.

371
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,988
- Richie?
- Yeah?

372
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,071
Put in your bit.

373
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,996
I grind my teeth.

374
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,315
What are their names?

375
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,755
- Scott and Kate.
- Scott and Kate.

376
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,559
Who's this?

377
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:05,192
- My wife.
- Where is the little lady?

378
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,394
- In heaven.
- She dead?

379
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,311
Yes, she is.

380
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,358
How'd she die?

381
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,873
Auto wreck.

382
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:24,155
Come on, Jacob, gimme some
more details. How'd it happen?
Some fucking drunk kill her?

383
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,232
No. It was a rainy night.

384
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,517
The brakes on the car
weren't great.

385
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,239
She had to stop suddenly.

386
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,915
She slid on the road.
She crashed. She died.

387
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,560
- She died right away?
- Not quite.

388
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,914
She was trapped in the wreck
for about... six hours...

389
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,275
before she passed on.

390
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:54,354
Yep. Those acts of God really stick
it in and break it off, don't they?

391
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:57,637
Yes, they do.

392
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,109
Is that real?

393
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,636
- Yes.
- I've seen one of these things before.

394
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:07,315
A friend of mine had himself ordained
a minister of his own religion.

395
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:12,758
Some way to fuck the I.R.S.
Is that what you're doing,
or are you the real McCoy?

396
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,751
The real McCoy.

397
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,878
<i>- You're a preacher?
- I was a minister.</i>

398
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,474
"Was" as in not any more?

399
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,596
<i>- Yes.
- Why'd you quit?</i>

400
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,511
I think I've gotten about...

401
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,910
as up close and personal
with you as I'm gonna get.

402
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,391
Let's just keep this friendly, okay,
Pops? Let's not get too sensitive.

403
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,153
You're right. Enough with
the gettin'-to-know-you shit. All right.

404
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,277
I don't give a rat's ass about you
or your fuckin' family.

405
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,875
You can all live forever,
or you can die this second.

406
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,951
And I don't
give a shit which.

407
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,031
The only things that
I care about are me,

408
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,270
that son of a bitch
back there in the back and the money.

409
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,636
<i>So you help us get across
the border without incident,</i>

410
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,234
you stay with us through the night
without trying anything funny,

411
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,311
<i>without trying to escape,</i>

412
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,834
and in the morning I'm gonna
let you guys go, all of you.

413
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:10,074
How do I know you'll keep your word?
You have to convince me
you're tellin' the truth.

414
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:13,118
Look, dick-head, the only thing
that you have to be convinced about...

415
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,829
is the fact that you are
stuck in a situation with a couple
of real mean motor scooters.

416
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:20,196
<i>I don't want to have to worry
about you all fuckin' night.</i>

417
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,078
I don't think you wanna be worrying
about my brother's intentions...

418
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,197
towards your daughter
all night, either.

419
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,919
- Did you notice the way
he was looking at her?
- Yes.

420
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,831
<i>- You didn't like it, did you?
- No, I didn't.</i>

421
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,832
<i>I didn't think so.
You get us into Mexico,</i>

422
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:37,629
and you don't try to escape,
and your daughter will be safe.

423
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:42,157
<i>And in the morning I will let you go.
I give you my word, Jacob.</i>

424
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,150
If he touches her,
I'll kill him!

425
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,789
Fair enough. You break your word,
I'll kill all of ya.

426
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,671
Did you mean what you said
back there in the room?

427
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,915
What?

428
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,109
In the room?

429
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,397
Did you mean what you said back there,
or were just foolin' around?

430
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:03,758
Because if you really want me to do
that for you, I will. I'd be happy to.

431
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:09,669
- Do what?
- What you said back there in the room?

432
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,035
What did I say?

433
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:15,749
<i>- You asked me if I would eat...
- Richie.</i>

434
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,549
- What?
- I told you to watch those kids.
Not to talk to them.

435
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,871
<i>You don't have nothin' to say to one
another, so let's just cut the chatter.</i>

436
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,271
We'll talk later. Okay?

437
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,156
All right, everybody,
it's show time.

438
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,950
Richie, you take Kate
into the bathroom. Scott,
get up here with your dad. Let's go.

439
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,755
Now, what are you
gonna say?

440
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,591
I don't have
the slightest idea.

441
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,592
Just keep thinking about the gun
next to Kate's head.

442
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,231
Get in.

443
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,234
This isn't gonna work, Seth.

444
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,118
Shut up. It's gonna work
just fine.

445
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,031
What are you gonna do?

446
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,714
I'm gonna try and get us
across the border.

447
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,473
Dad, you have to tell them
they're back there.

448
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,120
Have you forgotten
about your sister?

449
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,510
I want to go on record right now as
saying that this is a very bad idea.

450
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,592
Duly noted.
Now shut up.

451
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:48,992
Oh, my God. Look over here.
Step right over there.

452
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,674
They're gonna kill us, Dad.
They're gonna get us across the border,

453
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,991
take us out in the desert,
then they're gonna fuckin' shoot us.

454
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,514
If they get over the border,
they're gonna let us go.

455
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:03,072
No, they won't. Dad, come on.
I watch those reality shows.
They never let anybody go.

456
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:06,630
Any cop'll tell you, in a situation like
this, you get a chance, you go for it.

457
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,076
It may not seem like it, but I know
exactly what I'm doing. Trust me.

458
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,390
I can't do that, Dad.

459
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,552
<i>- If you don't tell the cops, I will.
- Now listen to me!</i>

460
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:18,598
You ain't gonna do
a goddam thing! You hear me?

461
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,396
- I'm runnin' the show!
I make the decisions!
- He is runnin' the show...

462
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,710
- I'm runnin' the show!
- Dad!

463
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,073
Shh. I make the plays.

464
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,072
You back the plays I make.

465
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,628
I need your cover.

466
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,188
Cover me.

467
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,268
How many with you?

468
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,510
Just my son and I.

469
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,512
What's your purpose in Mexico?

470
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:54,718
Vacation. I'm takin' him
to see his first bull fight.

471
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,631
They're gonna search the van.

472
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:01,157
As long as you don't act like a
fuckin' nut, we're gonna be fine.

473
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:05,119
- What the hell's that supposed to mean?
- What?

474
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,191
- You just called me a fuckin' nut.
- No, I didn't.

475
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,670
Yes, you did. You said, "As long
as I don't act like a fucking nut."

476
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,399
- Implying that I've been acting
like a fucking nut.
- Take a pill.

477
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:16,836
- I just meant be cool.
- Yeah, you meant that,
but you meant the other too.

478
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,990
This is not the time, Richie.

479
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:23,471
Hey, fuck those spic pigs, man!
You called me a "fucking nut."

480
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,916
- Now, where I come from, that
stops the train in its tracks.
- Keep your fucking voice down.

481
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,479
What?

482
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,316
- What was that?
- Hmm?

483
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,949
Oh! That was just, just
my daughter in the bathroom.

484
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,838
I thought you said
it was just you and your son?

485
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,833
Um... I meant me and my son
and my daughter.

486
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,309
Open up. I'm comin' aboard.

487
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,476
What was the nuttiest thing
I did, Seth? I'm curious.
Tell me. What was it?

488
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,710
- This is not the time, Richie.
- I know.

489
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,678
Was it possibly when your ass was
rotting in jail and I broke it out?

490
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,036
- That was nutty, huh?
Not to mention stupid.

491
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,153
Thanks.

492
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,757
<i>- I'm in the bathroom.
- Open up. It's Border Patrol.</i>

493
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,559
<i>It's open.</i>

494
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:41,190
Do you mind?
Shut the fuckin' door, please!

495
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,159
Excuse me.

496
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,434
Goddam, that was intense!

497
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,151
Oh, baby, we did it.
We're in Mexico.

498
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,710
We're fuckin' in Mexico,
you little piece of fuckin' shit!

499
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,870
Come on!
Kate, get out here.

500
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,275
<i>All right, listen up.
Everybody, listen.</i>

501
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:22,831
Now I know that I put you all
through hell, and I know that
I have been one rough pecker.

502
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,629
But from here on out,
you guys are all in my cool book.

503
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,076
<i>Scotty, I want you to help me
with Richie. Lay him down
on the couch over there. Jacob.</i>

504
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,948
You're gonna keep driving down
this street until you come to
another street called Digallo.

505
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:37,157
When you get to Digallo, you're gonna
turn this big bastard left,

506
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,915
and you're gonna go down
a couple of miles until you see
a bar called the Titty Twister.

507
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,560
- From what I understand,
you cannot miss it.
- Then?

508
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,677
And then you stop because
that's where we're goin'.

509
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,468
Don't make a career
out of this, okay?

510
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,795
Come on, hey.

511
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,836
Hey, you okay?

512
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:11,596
Yeah, I think so. What happened?

513
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,877
- I don't know. You just passed out.
- I did?

514
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,315
Mm-hmm. You said something
about your hand hurtin',

515
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,995
- and then you just hit the ground
like a sack of potatoes.
- Really?

516
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,753
Head hit the toilet.
You scared the shit out of me.

517
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,832
You sure you're okay?

518
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,435
Yeah. I, I think so.
I'm just a little fucked up.

519
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:34,911
Well, let me tell you something
that's gonna clear your head right up.

520
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,278
- What?
- We are officially Mexicans.

521
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,636
We're in Mexico, buddy.

522
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:45,154
<i>- We are?
- Yeah. We're heading down
to the rendezvous right now.</i>

523
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,435
We're gonna pound booze,
wait for Carlos.

524
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,114
When he gets there,
he's gonna take us down to El Rey.

525
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:54,557
And then you and I, my brother,
we're gonna kick fuckin' back.

526
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,790
- How do you like them apples?
- Far out.

527
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,192
Where's my glasses?

528
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,750
Oh, uh... Yeah, they, uh...
they broke when you fell.

529
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,398
- Fuck, Seth, these are my only pair!
- Don't worry about it.

530
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,995
- We'll get you another pair.
- Of course I'm gonna worry
about it. I can't see!

531
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,196
I'll take care of it
when we get to El Rey.

532
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,555
Yeah, like some Mexican hole in
the wall's gonna have my prescription.

533
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:21,189
It's not a big deal
until you make it a big deal.
Now, I was in a very good mood.

534
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,477
So stop bringing me down
with this bullshit!

535
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,437
I can't wear this shit.

536
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:32,275
Hey, guys.
We're here.

537
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,430
Pussy!

538
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,079
All right,
pussy, pussy, pussy!

539
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,435
Come on in, pussy lovers.

540
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,751
Here at the Titty Twister,
we're slashin' pussy in half.

541
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:25,197
Give us an offer on our best selection
of pussy. This is a pussy blowout!

542
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,637
All right, we got white pussy, black
pussy, Spanish pussy, yellow pussy.

543
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,597
We got hot pussy, cold pussy.

544
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,592
We got wet pussy.
We got smelly pussy.

545
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:38,195
We got hairy pussy, bloody pussy.
We got snappin' pussy.

546
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,317
We got silk pussy, velvet pussy,
"Nalgahyde" pussy.

547
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,676
We even got horse pussy,
dog pussy, chicken pussy.

548
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,638
Come on, you want pussy.
Come on in, pussy lovers.

549
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:51,235
If we don't got it, you don't want it.
Come on in, pussy lovers.

550
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,876
<i>Okay, troops, it's the homestretch.
Here's the deal.</i>

551
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,431
This place closes at dawn.
Carlos is gonna meet us here
sometime before dawn.

552
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,513
Now, we are gonna go in there,
we're gonna take a seat, we're
gonna have a bunch of drinks.

553
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,670
And we're gonna wait
for Carlos.

554
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,558
Let me just say something.
I'm very happy about where we're at.

555
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,952
We got a real nice I-don't-
fuck-with-you, you-don't-fuck-
with-me attitude goin' on.

556
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,874
So if everybody just keeps playin' it
cool... I'm talkin' to you, too, Richie...

557
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,155
then everybody's gonna get
what they want.

558
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,714
Okay, hard drinkers, let's drink hard.
I'm buyin'. Come on.

559
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,836
Here we go.

560
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,189
Out of the stew pot
and into the fire.

561
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:46,592
Attention, pussy shoppers!
Take advantage of our penny pussy sale.

562
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,319
If you buy one piece of pussy
at the regular price,

563
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:54,110
you will get another piece of pussy of
equal or lesser value for only a penny.

564
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,350
Try and beat pussy
for a penny.

565
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:00,752
If you can find cheaper pussy
anywhere... fuck it!

566
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,000
Hey, what do we have
approaching here?

567
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:10,437
A new flavor: Apple pie pussy.

568
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,829
Hey, not so fast, slick.

569
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,672
Step aside, asshole.

570
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,637
Son of a...

571
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,679
Now, is my shit together
or is my shit together?

572
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,551
Here we go.

573
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,753
- Hi! How ya doin'?
Enjoying it? I hope so!

574
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:44,834
Now... this is
my kind of place.

575
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,791
I could become a regular.

576
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,192
Whisky!

577
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:45,318
- You can't come in here.
- What do you mean?

578
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,755
It's a private bar.
You're not welcome.

579
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,752
<i>Are you tellin' me that
I'm not good enough to drink here?</i>

580
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:54,753
<i>This bar is for bikers
and truckers only.</i>

581
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:57,951
You, get out!

582
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:00,156
<i>¡Ande, pendejo!</i>

583
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,994
- Take your hand off of me.
- I'm gonna count to three...

584
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:07,436
- No, I'm gonna count to three.
- One...

585
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,432
- Two...
- Now, wait a minute.
There is no reason to get ugly.

586
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:14,274
There is just a misunderstanding
going on here.

587
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:17,750
You said this bar
is for truckers and bikers?

588
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:20,638
Well, I'm a truck driver.

589
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:25,589
If you look outside your door
in your parking lot, you'll see
a big recreational vehicle.

590
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:30,515
<i>That's mine. In order to
drive that legally, you need
a Class Two driver's license.</i>

591
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,796
This bar is for truck drivers?

592
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,916
<i>I am a truck driver.</i>

593
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,719
These are my friends.

594
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,475
Welcome to the Titty Twister.

595
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:49,677
- Bottle of whisky and five glasses.
- Coming right up.

596
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,073
- You serve food here, Jose?
- Best in Mexico.

597
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,957
I kind of doubt that.

598
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,039
We're gonna go over here. You send a
waitress over to take our order. Okay?

599
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:27,358
Anytime you want a lap dance with that
girl, kid, just let me know, all right?

600
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:29,795
It's on me.

601
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,030
Pass.

602
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,270
Is it against your religion?

603
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:39,239
No. I do drink.
I'm just not drinkin' now.

604
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:42,676
- Fair enough. More for me.
Scott, how 'bout you?
- No.

605
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:47,151
- Kate, how 'bout you?
- No, I can't. I'm not 21 yet.

606
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,151
That means yes.

607
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:51,595
Post time, Kate!

608
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:56,435
Here we go. You slam it down. You knock
the glass down on the table, all right?

609
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,909
One, two, three!

610
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,799
Atta girl, Kate.

611
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,917
<i>- Scotty, are you ready?
Here we go. You ready for one?
- Okay.</i>

612
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,676
- No, he won't.
- Yes, he will, because
I'm not drinkin' by myself.

613
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,637
Kate, round two.
You ready?

614
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,632
- Here we go.
- Yes, I'll have another one. Thank you.

615
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:19,711
On three. One, two, three.

616
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,956
Why are you so agitated?

617
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,998
I'm still stewin' about that ape
layin' his hand on me.

618
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:38,629
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna sit here and
I'm gonna finish this bottle.

619
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,110
And when I am finished, I'm gonna take
this bottle and I'm gonna bust it...

620
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,998
over his melon fucking head!

621
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:50,074
Before we stepped in here,
you told all of us to be cool.
So, that means you too.

622
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:54,278
I never said do what I do.
I said do what I say.

623
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,835
Are you such
a fucking loser...

624
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,876
you can't tell
when you've won?

625
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:19,394
- What'd you call me?
- Nothing.

626
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:22,677
I didn't make a statement.
I asked a question.

627
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,672
- Would you like me to ask it again?
- Mm-hmm.

628
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,150
Are you such a loser
you can't tell when you've won?

629
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,995
The entire state of Texas...

630
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:37,437
along with the F.B.I.
Are lookin' for you.

631
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:41,798
Did they find you?
No, they couldn't.

632
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,711
You've won, Seth.

633
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,436
Enjoy it.

634
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,995
Jacob.

635
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:55,557
I want you to have
a drink with me. I insist.

636
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,637
To your family.

637
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,234
To yours.

638
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:14,672
And now,
for your viewing pleasure,

639
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:17,399
the Mistress of the Macabre,

640
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:21,951
the Epitome of Evil,
the most sinister woman to ever
dance on the face of this earth.

641
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,918
<i>- Bite this!
- Lowly dog!</i>

642
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,754
Bow your head.
Kneel and worship...

643
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:32,753
<i>at the feet
of Santanico Pandemonium!</i>

644
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,551
<i>Ooow!</i>

645
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:44,436
That's what I call
a fuckin' show!

646
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,751
<i>Wow!</i>

647
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,992
Come here!

648
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:04,117
<i>- That guy! It's the puta over there!
- Richie, get back on the clock.</i>

649
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:09,475
- How many?
- Three.

650
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,396
Which one?

651
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:18,474
This piece of shit here, man,
broke my finger and my nose!

652
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:21,518
And this faggot kicked me in the ribs
while I was down!

653
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:24,114
<i>- Up!
- Fuck you, bogeyman!</i>

654
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,631
Fuck!
Fuck!

655
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,710
Fuck you!

656
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:49,396
<i>All right! Everybody be cool, or
you'll be just as dead as these fucks!</i>

657
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:52,552
<i>How's your hand?
Let me see it.</i>

658
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:57,833
Shit.

659
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:07,754
You think that was funny?

660
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:19,311
Sit down!

661
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:45,793
- Richie, look out!
- Motherfuckin' shit! Get the fuck off!

662
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,916
- Hey! Hey!
- Get her off me!

663
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,629
- What the fuck are you doing?
Shoot her!

664
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,277
I'm comin', buddy!

665
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:01,751
Richie. Richie. Rich.

666
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,912
Richie.

667
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:09,518
Fucking bitch!

668
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:12,160
Richie.

669
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,511
Hey.

670
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:37,195
What the fuck?

671
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:45,237
Dinner...
Is served.

672
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:55,314
What the fuck?

673
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:07,628
Fuck! Get off me...

674
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,391
Come on! Come on, you!

675
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:26,471
Jacob!

676
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,350
<i>Oh, no! Look out! Look out!</i>

677
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:41,271
- You know what everybody
says about me, huh?

678
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:44,477
I suck!

679
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,915
Eeew.

680
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:22,710
Let's see if you taste
as good as your brother.

681
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:25,234
Fuck you!

682
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:45,631
Hey! Hey! Hey!

683
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:02,591
Oh, shit!

684
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,470
Huh?

685
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,595
Gimme that!

686
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:21,399
Hmph.

687
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:36,668
I'm not gonna drain you completely.

688
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:40,832
You'll be my slave.

689
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:45,789
Because I don't think
you're worthy of human blood.
You feed on the blood of stray dogs.

690
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:47,871
You'll be my foot stool.

691
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:52,033
And at my command, you'll lick
the dog shit from my boot heel.

692
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:55,317
- Ooh?
- Since you'll be my dog,

693
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:58,597
<i>your new name will be... Spud.</i>

694
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,233
Welcome... to slavery.

695
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:06,278
No, thanks.
I already had a wife.

696
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:31,196
We might be in trouble.

697
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,912
<i>- Yo, monkey man.</i>

698
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:45,279
Anything you got
to say to them,

699
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:47,316
say to me first.

700
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:51,996
This!

701
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,798
That's enough.

702
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:38,111
Ain't they supposed to
burn up or something?

703
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:50,079
Oh... fuck.

704
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:03,238
Now let's kill
that fuckin' band!

705
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:05,276
I can do that.

706
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:09,149
Fuck you, everybody.
Good night!

707
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:14,432
Fuckers.

708
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:34,598
Hey, buddy.

709
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:38,309
I'm sorry I fucked
things up, Richie.

710
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:47,720
You would've
liked it in El Rey. You would've.

711
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:50,439
You would've found peace.

712
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:54,512
I love you, Richie.

713
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:58,753
I love you too, Seth.

714
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:13,113
You touch my brother
with that stake, biker,

715
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:16,590
and vampires aren't gonna have
to suck your blood; they'll be
able to lick it off the floor.

716
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:21,037
- He's not your brother any more.
- That's a matter of opinion, and
I don't give a fuck about yours.

717
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:24,749
Don't be a fool!
He'll kill us all.

718
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:26,592
- Shut up!
- Yeah, shut up!

719
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:28,830
Let's go. Move, move.

720
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:47,075
Hold him down.

721
01:07:52,520 --> 01:07:54,556
Richie.

722
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:59,475
Here is the peace in death
that I could not give you in life.

723
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,991
Fuck!

724
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:28,838
Seth... are you okay?

725
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:32,196
I'm peachy, Kate.
The world is my oyster.

726
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:39,315
Except for the fact
that I just...

727
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:42,597
I just rammed a wooden stake
into my brother's chest...

728
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:45,148
because he turned
into a vampire.

729
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:47,470
Even though
I don't believe in vampires.

730
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:51,712
Aside from that
unfortunate business,

731
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:54,234
everything is hunky-dory.

732
01:08:56,120 --> 01:09:00,511
- I'm really, really sorry.
- Bullshit! Bullshit!

733
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:05,116
If it were up to you,
if you had half a chance,
you would feed us to those fucks.

734
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:07,236
Then why didn't I?

735
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:15,879
I'm sorry you lost your brother.
I'm sorry he's dead.
I'm sorry everybody's dead.

736
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:20,158
But if we're gonna get out of this, we
need you clean and sober and thinking.

737
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:22,231
Not drunk.

738
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,520
What is that?

739
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:30,718
<i>Don't know. First I thought
it was just... birds.</i>

740
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:36,030
It's bats.

741
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:43,596
Gimme a hand.

742
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,558
No!

743
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:33,632
Hey!

744
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:40,671
Whoa.

745
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:49,554
You're dead! Oh...

746
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:53,076
Come on!

747
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:05,678
<i>We'll take care of this mess. You go
stake the rest of those ugly fucks.</i>

748
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,149
Way ahead of you.

749
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:11,198
- Watch your step.
What's your name, girlie?
- Kate. What's yours?

750
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:14,078
- Sex Machine. Pleased to meet you, Kate.
- You too.

751
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:38,195
- Is everybody okay?
- Yeah. I'm okay.

752
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:44,678
<i> Does anybody know
what's going on here?</i>

753
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:48,958
I know what's goin' on. We've got
a bunch of vampires out there...

754
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:52,635
<i>trying to get in here and
suck our fucking blood, and
that's it, plain and simple.</i>

755
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:55,871
And I don't wanna hear anything about
"I don't believe in vampires."

756
01:12:55,960 --> 01:13:00,192
Because I don't fucking believe
in vampires, but I believe
in my own two eyes.

757
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:02,874
And what I saw
is fucking vampires.

758
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:06,430
Now, do we all agree that what
we are dealing with is vampires?

759
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:09,637
<i>- Yes.
- You, too, preacher?</i>

760
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:13,235
I don't believe in vampires,
but I believe in what I saw.

761
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:18,314
Good for you. Now that we agree
we're dealing with vampires,
what do we know about vampires?

762
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:22,279
- Crosses hurt vampires.
Do we have a cross?
- In the motorhome.

763
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:25,238
<i>In other words, no.
Wait a second. Just look around.</i>

764
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:29,154
We got crosses all over the place.
All you gotta do is
put two sticks together,

765
01:13:29,240 --> 01:13:31,993
<i>- and you got a cross.
- Yeah, he's right. Peter Cushing
does that all the time.</i>

766
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:35,516
Okay, I'll buy that. So, we
got crosses covered. What else?

767
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:38,398
Wooden stakes in the heart
have been working pretty good so far.

768
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:42,632
And garlic, sunlight,
holy water. I'm not sure.

769
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:46,110
- Doesn't silver have something
to do with vampires?
- That's werewolves.

770
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:49,988
I know silver bullets are werewolves.
I'm sure silver has something
to do with vampires.

771
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:52,116
Well, does anybody
have any silver?

772
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:57,632
Okay. Then, who cares?

773
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:00,188
Has anybody here read
a real book about vampires,

774
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:02,919
or are we just rememberin'
what some movie said?

775
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,878
<i>- I mean, a real book.
- You mean like a Time-Life book?</i>

776
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:08,838
I take it the answer's no.
Okay, then.

777
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:11,229
<i>What do we know
about these vampires?</i>

778
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:13,993
We know they got superhuman strength,
but we can hurt 'em.

779
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:16,310
<i>- Yeah.
- Another thing, though.</i>

780
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:21,076
If you're gonna drive a chair
leg through a human, you better
be one strong son of a bitch.

781
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:24,596
I mean, the human body is...
one rough, tough machine.

782
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:27,194
But these vamps... these vamps,
they're... they have soft bodies.

783
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:30,750
<i>The texture of their skin is soft.
And they're mushier.</i>

784
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:32,990
<i>You can push shit
right through them.</i>

785
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:36,117
Conceivably, if you hit one hard enough,
take their head right off.

786
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:42,035
<i> Actually, our best weapon
against these satanic cocksuckers...</i>

787
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:45,271
is this man.

788
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:48,477
He's a preacher.
As far as God's concerned,

789
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:51,597
we might as well all be a piece of shit,
but he's one of the boys.

790
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:56,800
Only one problem: His faith
isn't what it used to be.

791
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:00,910
I've had enough
of your taunts.

792
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:05,955
I'm not taunting you, Jacob.
We need you.

793
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:09,032
<i>A faithless preacher...</i>

794
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:11,680
doesn't mean shit to us.

795
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:18,754
A servant of God can take a cross
and shove it up these monsters' asses.

796
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:23,231
<i>A servant of God can bless the tap water
and make it a weapon.</i>

797
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:27,993
Jacob...

798
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:30,150
I know why you lost your faith.

799
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:37,230
How could holiness exist
if your wife can be taken away
from you and your children?

800
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:41,960
Now, I've always said
that God can kiss my ass,

801
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:45,316
but I just changed my lifetime tune
about 30 minutes ago.

802
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:48,870
'Cause I know that whatever is
out there trying to get in...

803
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:51,076
is pure evil
straight from hell.

804
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:54,755
And if there is a hell,
and those sons of bitches are from it,

805
01:15:54,840 --> 01:15:57,638
then there has got to be a heaven,
Jacob; there's gotta be!

806
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:05,318
So, which are you?

807
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:10,190
Are you a faithless preacher, or are you
a mean motherfuckin' servant of God?

808
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:24,031
I'm a mean...

809
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:26,509
Servant of God.

810
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:36,473
I don't know if I can
take much more of that noise.

811
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:38,755
Sure you can.

812
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:43,715
You can take it
because you got no choice.

813
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:48,669
How'd you like to spend 24 hours of it
lying in some muddy ditch,

814
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:52,639
with nothing but the rotten corpses
of your friends to keep you company?

815
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:55,234
What are you talkin' about?

816
01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:01,470
I was in 'Nam...

817
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:03,676
back in '72.

818
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:07,878
I was trapped
behind enemy lines...

819
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:09,951
<i>with my entire squad dead.</i>

820
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:14,638
They thought they had
killed everyone.

821
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:17,473
Except for me,
they was right.

822
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:20,199
<i>But it wasn't for
their lack of tryin'.</i>

823
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:22,714
A grenade...

824
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:25,394
blew up right beside me.

825
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:28,791
That's why I'm so pretty.

826
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:33,590
<i>And they start pushin'
all them bodies in on top of me.</i>

827
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:35,875
And all I could do
was lay there.

828
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:37,916
Play possum.

829
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,629
Listen to the enemy joke,
laugh, hour...

830
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:45,838
<i>after hour after hour.</i>

831
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:49,913
<i>- So I finally...
- Kill them.</i>

832
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,912
<i>Kill them. Kill them all.</i>

833
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:56,554
<i>Sex Machine.</i>

834
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,915
<i>Kill them.</i>

835
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,718
<i>Kill them.</i>

836
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:05,953
So I finally climbed
out of this hole...

837
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:09,271
and I sneaked up on the enemy
while he was sleeping.

838
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:13,672
And I killed one, two,
three, four, five...

839
01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:45,429
I came to my senses,

840
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:51,391
and I realized... I had killed
an entire V.C. Squad.

841
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:53,391
<i>Single-handed.</i>

842
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:57,473
There was... blood...

843
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:02,429
and chunks of... yellow flesh...
clinging to my bayonet.

844
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,958
To this day,
I don't remember...

845
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:14,599
<i>Get him off of me!
Get off of me!</i>

846
01:19:14,680 --> 01:19:16,796
<i>Please! Get him off!</i>

847
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:23,640
No!

848
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:31,711
<i>Dad!</i>

849
01:19:44,080 --> 01:19:47,868
<i>He fuckin' bit me.
He fuckin’ bit me!</i>

850
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:52,351
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Come on, Sex Machine.

851
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:06,239
Oh... shit!

852
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:18,757
Get up! Get up!
Up! Come on!

853
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:32,431
Go! Fuck!

854
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:46,637
- Wait. We have to go back for my father.
- Your dad's dead, Kate.

855
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:36,998
The people... who walk...

856
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:40,516
<i>in the darkness...</i>

857
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:42,750
<i>have seen the light!</i>

858
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:09,316
<i>Open the door!</i>

859
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:11,470
Open the door!

860
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,478
Go! Go!

861
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:17,630
Oh, Daddy!

862
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:20,029
<i>Jacob, are you bit?</i>

863
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:23,191
Yeah.

864
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:26,909
Motherfuck.
Motherfuckin' vampires!

865
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,436
I'm gonna kill every last one of you
godless, fuckin' pieces of shit!

866
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:34,752
You bet you are, and I'm gonna help
you do it. But we ain't got much time.

867
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:37,957
- You're gonna be okay, aren't you?
- No, I'm not.

868
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:41,476
I've been bit.
In fact, I'm already dead.

869
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:44,358
Now...

870
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:48,592
I'd say in the next 20 or 30 minutes our
friends outside will bust in this door.

871
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:51,399
<i>And I'll probably turn into
a vampire within the hour.</i>

872
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:55,712
Now, you have two choices. You can wait
for me to turn, then deal with me.

873
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:58,758
<i>Or we can kick open that door,
and the four of us...</i>

874
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:02,196
can go at 'em, hit 'em
with everything we have.

875
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:06,239
<i>But if we're gonna go at 'em,
we gotta go at 'em now.</i>

876
01:23:07,640 --> 01:23:09,471
What's this stuff?

877
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:12,358
My guess is
this little dive...

878
01:23:12,440 --> 01:23:15,512
<i>has been feeding on bikers and truckers
for a long time.</i>

879
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:18,239
<i>This is probably the shipments
they stole off the trucks.</i>

880
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:20,436
I say, let's tear this place
apart for weapons.

881
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:22,988
So when they burst through,
we'll make 'em wish they never did.

882
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:26,356
I don't care about livin' or
dyin' any more. I just wanna
send as many of these devils...

883
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:28,237
- back to hell as I can.
- Amen.

884
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:31,639
Loving God,
bless this water...

885
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:35,235
<i>and give us Your protection and strength
in this, our darkest hour. Amen.</i>

886
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:47,274
<i>Before we go any further, I need you
three to promise me somethin'.</i>

887
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:51,069
I'll fight with you till the bitter end,
but when I turn into one of them,

888
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:53,958
I won't be Jacob any more.

889
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:55,917
I'll be a lapdog of Satan.

890
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:59,788
I want you three to promise you'll take
me down, no different from the rest.

891
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:02,440
I promise, Jacob.

892
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:04,636
Kate? Scott?

893
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:07,676
I promise.

894
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:10,228
- Scott?
- Yeah, I promise.

895
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:15,674
Why don't I believe you?

896
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:20,239
I'm gonna ask you two again.

897
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:23,073
Then I want you
to swear to God...

898
01:25:23,160 --> 01:25:25,993
that you'll kill me!

899
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:29,868
If you don't, I'm gonna just
kill myself right now.

900
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:34,192
Now, since you need me,
I think you better swear!

901
01:25:34,280 --> 01:25:39,832
Kate, do you swear to God
that when I become one of the undead,

902
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:42,354
<i>you'll kill me?</i>

903
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:45,551
Kate!

904
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:49,918
We don't have much time,
so I'm only giving you to
the count of five. One, two,

905
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,956
<i>three, four...</i>

906
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:54,508
Okay, all right!
I promise I'll do it!

907
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:59,157
Good girl. Now, Scott,

908
01:25:59,240 --> 01:26:01,754
we have even less time,
so I'm giving you the count of three.

909
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:04,070
- One...
- You don't believe in suicide.

910
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:08,199
It's not suicide...
if you're already dead. Two...

911
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:11,556
Okay! Okay.

912
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:15,758
- I'll kill you when you change.
I swear to God in Jesus Christ's name.
- Thank you, son.

913
01:26:15,960 --> 01:26:20,954
Okay, vampire killers, let's
kill some fuckin' vampires.

914
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:44,149
Those who walk in the darkness
have seen the light.

915
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:47,073
In the darkness
have seen the light.

916
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:50,715
<i>In the darkness, the light.</i>

917
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:12,036
Those who walk in the darkness
have seen the light.

918
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:16,677
Kill 'em all!

919
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:41,199
Come on! Come on!

920
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:38,273
Dad?

921
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:49,077
Dad! No, Dad!

922
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:51,879
Dad! Dad!

923
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:05,558
I swear to God
in Jesus Christ's name.

924
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:09,070
Oh, my God!

925
01:31:09,160 --> 01:31:11,469
Fight now, cry later!

926
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:20,517
Get the fuck off!
Get off! Get off! Get 'em off!

927
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,560
Kill me, Kate.

928
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:39,309
Just kill me, Kate.

929
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:42,392
I can't.

930
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:04,552
- How many bullets you have?
- I don't know. Not many.

931
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:08,155
When you run out, start cold-cockin'
'em. Make 'em sing for their supper.

932
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:20,993
<i>Seth, should I save
the last bullets for us?</i>

933
01:32:21,080 --> 01:32:24,470
<i>No. Use it on the next fuck
that tries to bite you.</i>

934
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:37,071
Shoot more holes.
Shoot more holes!

935
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:44,670
- Come here!
- They can't go into the light.

936
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:47,797
Come here. Come here!
All right.

937
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:49,950
Hey, Seth, don't leave me.

938
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:54,600
<i>Come here. Come here. Come on!</i>

939
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:58,391
Come on, you!

940
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:02,708
Come here, you fucks!

941
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:06,236
<i>Hello?
I'm looking for my friend Seth.</i>

942
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:09,312
Carlos! Kick in the door!

943
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:20,832
Go!

944
01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:23,070
Son of a bitch.

945
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:55,549
What the fuck
was goin' on in there?

946
01:33:58,280 --> 01:34:00,840
What's the matter with you?
Are you crazy?

947
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:06,119
Why, out of all the godforsaken
shitholes in Mexico,
do we have to meet here?

948
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:10,438
One place is just
as good as another.

949
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:12,636
You ever been here before?

950
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:17,271
No. Ah, I drove by it a couple times.

951
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:19,715
It's a rowdy place.
It's out in the middle of nowhere.

952
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:22,268
There'll be no cops.
And it's open from dusk till dawn.

953
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:25,272
Didn't you say you wanted
to meet in the morning? Here we are.

954
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:27,954
Since you just picked this place
out of a hat, my brother is dead,

955
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:31,715
that girl's entire
fucking family is dead!

956
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:35,794
What? Were they psychos, or...

957
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:39,350
They look like psychos? Is that what
they looked like? They were vampires.

958
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:42,398
Psychos do not explode
when sunlight hits 'em.

959
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:45,278
I don't give a fuck
how crazy they are!

960
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:49,792
Seth... how can I
make it up to you?

961
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:53,190
You can't make it up
to me, Carlos. You can't do it.

962
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:55,714
Can't make it up!

963
01:34:58,640 --> 01:35:02,838
Fifteen percent instead of 30% for
my stay in El Rey, that's a good start.

964
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:06,276
Twenty-eight.

965
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:08,794
My brother's gone.
You understand that?

966
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:12,509
He's gone and he's not comin' back,
and that is your fault.

967
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:18,909
Twenty.

968
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,468
Twenty-five.

969
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:25,553
Kate. Go to the R.V.,
get the suitcase.

970
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:33,718
You look like hell.

971
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:36,678
You want a cold beer?
I got some in the car.

972
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:40,395
Come on, they're cold. Huh?

973
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:43,836
I got Mexican and domestic.

974
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:46,229
<i>Chíngalo.</i>

975
01:35:59,240 --> 01:36:03,074
<i>So, how do you like the car?
It's all right.</i>

976
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:05,993
I said "like new."
This is a '90.

977
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:09,959
<i>Hey, it is new, cabrón. Belonged
to a drug dealer friend of mine.</i>

978
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:14,511
<i>Hey, he only drove it
like 14 times in five years.
It's like new, I swear to God.</i>

979
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:20,313
- So, what do I do, follow you?
- Yeah, follow me.

980
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,994
All right, let's do it.

981
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:31,712
I'm sorry.

982
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:45,509
Yeah, I'm sorry too.

983
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:55,396
- I'll see ya.
- Seth?

984
01:36:57,080 --> 01:37:00,197
You need some company?

985
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:07,433
Kate, do you know where I'm goin'?
Do you know what El Rey is?

986
01:37:08,680 --> 01:37:11,513
<i>- No.
- Hey, Seth.</i>

987
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:13,955
It's time to go.

988
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:17,956
Go home, Kate.

989
01:37:21,080 --> 01:37:24,470
I may be a bastard,
but I'm not a fuckin' bastard.
