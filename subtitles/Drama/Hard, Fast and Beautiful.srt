3
00:00:22,223 --> 00:00:25,142
Dominic Toretto,

4
00:00:25,184 --> 00:00:29,103
You are hereby sentenced
to serve 25 years to life.

5
00:00:29,104 --> 00:00:33,104
At the Lompoc maximum
security prison system.

6
00:00:33,192 --> 00:00:36,012
Without the possibility of early parole.

7
00:01:50,185 --> 00:01:52,021
This is all the aftermath.

8
00:01:52,187 --> 00:01:54,188
Of a daring daylight breakout.

9
00:01:54,189 --> 00:01:57,026
There were 26 high risk inmates.

10
00:01:57,192 --> 00:01:59,277
Every one on board has been
accounted for.

11
00:01:59,278 --> 00:02:01,195
Except for one - Dominic Toretto.

12
00:02:01,196 --> 00:02:04,478
Police released the identity of the man they
believe orchestrated the shocking escape.

13
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:06,179
That amazingly resulted in no
fatalities this afternoon.

14
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,005
He is former federal agent
Brian O'Conner.

15
00:02:10,206 --> 00:02:13,208
A fierce manhunt is
underway for three fugitives tonight.

16
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:15,210
Multiple federal and local agencies
have joined forces.

17
00:02:15,211 --> 00:02:21,216
In the search for - Dominic Toretto and his
accomplishes Brian O'Conner and Mia Toretto.

18
00:02:21,217 --> 00:02:23,218
Despite every eye in the country
looking for them.

19
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:27,009
Where Toretto and O'Conner are now
is any ones guess.

20
00:04:05,194 --> 00:04:06,988
Let's get out of here.

21
00:04:12,403 --> 00:04:14,705
Mia...

22
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:23,504
Buster....

23
00:04:25,715 --> 00:04:27,508
Dom here yet.

24
00:04:27,717 --> 00:04:30,677
No.
- When was the last time you heard from him?

25
00:04:30,678 --> 00:04:32,678
A couple of weeks ago, up
in ecuador somewhere.

26
00:04:35,683 --> 00:04:38,478
- How does it feel ?
- Whats that?

27
00:04:38,686 --> 00:04:42,686
To be on the other side of a
wanted poster.

28
00:04:43,691 --> 00:04:46,611
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

29
00:04:58,036 --> 00:05:00,036
Time for bed little one.

30
00:05:00,061 --> 00:05:01,961
Can I bring him?

31
00:05:01,986 --> 00:05:03,486
Of course.

32
00:05:23,911 --> 00:05:25,911
Excuse me, sorry.

33
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:32,991
Why Rio Vince?

34
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:38,091
You mean after you screwed
everything up in LA?

35
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:44,377
Ended up free fallin thru
South America you know....

36
00:05:44,687 --> 00:05:46,687
Hittin every hell hole on the
way down

37
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:49,799
Would have kept on going
if not for Rosa...

38
00:06:06,024 --> 00:06:08,024
Does he know ?

39
00:06:19,704 --> 00:06:22,207
So...listen.

40
00:06:22,707 --> 00:06:24,507
There's a job coming up

41
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:27,711
I was hoping Dom was gonna
be here by now, but...

42
00:06:27,712 --> 00:06:31,282
This one's clean enough,
we can do it without him.

43
00:06:31,374 --> 00:06:32,674
Its a good gig.

44
00:06:32,675 --> 00:06:36,304
Couple of high end cars, easy targets.

45
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:39,681
A guy I know is putting together
a team to swipe em.

46
00:06:39,682 --> 00:06:41,683
Just need a few more willing bodies.

47
00:06:41,684 --> 00:06:43,478
Bud, I don't know.

48
00:06:43,686 --> 00:06:48,690
Look, the way car seem is down here, we
can unload them quick and get top dollar.

49
00:06:48,691 --> 00:06:51,486
Its easy money.

50
00:06:51,694 --> 00:06:54,489
From where I am sittin,

51
00:06:54,697 --> 00:06:58,201
It looks like you both
could use the pay day.

52
00:07:35,446 --> 00:07:36,405
What are you reading?

53
00:07:36,406 --> 00:07:40,118
- Travel guide.
- Yeah?

54
00:07:43,121 --> 00:07:45,707
Tokyo.

55
00:07:47,028 --> 00:07:49,028
Moscow

56
00:07:49,728 --> 00:07:51,728
Goa

57
00:07:51,754 --> 00:07:53,672
You know what all of these
places have in common.

58
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:55,425
No?

59
00:07:55,592 --> 00:07:58,177
No extradition.

60
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,526
Here we go.

61
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:31,669
Excuse me, buddy.

62
00:09:07,539 --> 00:09:09,349
Ok, we found em.

63
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:12,502
Yeah, second to the last raider.

64
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,637
What, what is it?

65
00:09:22,845 --> 00:09:25,845
DEA tags. This car is seized.

66
00:10:06,013 --> 00:10:07,723
Look, who showed up.

67
00:10:07,931 --> 00:10:11,393
Oh! GOD, I'm so happy you're ok.

68
00:10:13,687 --> 00:10:16,564
- I thought I told you to lay low.
- We were running on fumes.

69
00:10:16,565 --> 00:10:18,275
Had to make a call.

70
00:10:18,483 --> 00:10:21,360
Hey quit talking, we only
got a two minute window.

71
00:10:21,361 --> 00:10:24,323
Lets go, Vince.

72
00:11:00,811 --> 00:11:03,964
Ladies first.

73
00:11:21,755 --> 00:11:25,133
See you baby.

74
00:11:39,064 --> 00:11:43,064
Change of plans,
wait for my call.

75
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,114
Lets go.

76
00:12:02,045 --> 00:12:06,045
Where is she going?

77
00:12:13,557 --> 00:12:17,311
We are being robbed.
Go stop the train.

78
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,971
Access card, get the access card.

79
00:14:25,858 --> 00:14:30,278
There's a bridge.

80
00:14:42,524 --> 00:14:44,434
Luggage car is clear.

81
00:14:44,543 --> 00:14:48,921
??

82
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:53,258
Freeze.

83
00:16:19,153 --> 00:16:21,123
You had to make the call, huh.

84
00:16:21,131 --> 00:16:23,640
Shitty call, O'Conner.

85
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:27,727
Shitty call.

86
00:16:45,953 --> 00:16:49,582
You two stirred up quite a
bit of trouble today.

87
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:51,500
Three of my men dead.

88
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:53,986
Three dea agents, along with.

89
00:16:53,987 --> 00:16:55,904
Of course, this is business.

90
00:16:55,905 --> 00:16:59,117
Sometimes things go astray.

91
00:16:59,743 --> 00:17:01,660
All I care about is the car.

92
00:17:01,661 --> 00:17:03,371
Tell me where it is.

93
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,249
And I'll let you go

94
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,210
*** full of shit

95
00:17:10,253 --> 00:17:14,089
I don't know how you guys do business
in your part of the world.

96
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:18,886
But here in Rio... I like it when all
parties know what they're up against.

97
00:17:18,887 --> 00:17:21,890
That's funny, cause it goes both ways.

98
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:27,145
You know...

99
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,150
I hear your sister is
very beautiful.

100
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:36,317
Wherever she hides, I will find her.

101
00:18:40,343 --> 00:18:42,512
Mia?

102
00:18:43,221 --> 00:18:45,515
Hey ..

103
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:49,936
- You ok?
- Yeah, you alright?

104
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:02,407
Yeah, just like a toretto.

105
00:19:05,285 --> 00:19:06,995
Where's Vince?

106
00:19:07,162 --> 00:19:08,913
That's a good question.

107
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,832
He'll be here.

108
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:14,835
Guys, we are all over the news, they're blaming
us for killing those DEA agents on the train.

109
00:19:14,836 --> 00:19:17,713
Which means we just jumped to the
top of the wanted list.

110
00:19:17,714 --> 00:19:21,550
The feds have got to show
their agents are off the limits.

111
00:19:21,551 --> 00:19:24,053
They are gonna send their best guys,
we gotta get out of here.

112
00:19:24,054 --> 00:19:26,389
One thing we know for sure.

113
00:19:28,308 --> 00:19:30,977
Is that they wanted this car.

114
00:19:31,186 --> 00:19:36,486
- Something's in it.
- We find out what it is,
we'll know what we're up against.

115
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:58,963
Alright, listen up. The men we're after are professional runners.
They like speed and guarantee to go down the hardest possible way.

116
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:02,800
So make sure you got the thunderware on.
We find them, we take them as a team and we bring them back.

117
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:06,941
And above all else, we don't ever, ever let
them get into cars.

118
00:20:07,597 --> 00:20:11,597
The crime scene's 10 hours
old and counting men. Lets go hunting.

119
00:20:12,394 --> 00:20:15,105
Agent Hobbs? Chief of police.

120
00:20:15,272 --> 00:20:18,441
Sorry to hear for loss of your men.

121
00:20:22,028 --> 00:20:23,279
Is all this really necessary
to apprehend two men?

122
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,823
Let me tell you little something about these two men.
One's a former federal officer, been in deep cover for 5 years.

123
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:31,956
Knows every way we're gonna come for him.
The other one's a professional criminal, escaped prison twice,

124
00:20:32,057 --> 00:20:33,057
Spent half his life on run
avoiding folks like you.

125
00:20:34,457 --> 00:20:36,208
Well, if there's anything
we can do to help...

126
00:20:36,209 --> 00:20:36,834
Two things.

127
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:38,294
One - I need a translator.

128
00:20:38,295 --> 00:20:40,212
Alright, We have plenty...

129
00:20:40,213 --> 00:20:43,842
- Elena Neves.
- A patrol officer?

130
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,009
You heard me.

131
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,927
But why? We have many more
experienced people.

132
00:20:46,928 --> 00:20:48,638
I like her smile.

133
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:51,516
What's the second thing.

134
00:20:51,725 --> 00:20:55,103
Stay the fuck out of my way!

135
00:21:04,195 --> 00:21:06,489
Brian.

136
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:10,535
There's something I have to tell you.

137
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:11,710
Goddamn.

138
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,539
What a mess.

139
00:21:14,748 --> 00:21:18,001
Where you have been Vin.

140
00:21:18,585 --> 00:21:20,502
You better check that tone.

141
00:21:20,503 --> 00:21:24,893
- You better answer the goddam question.
- Stop it, both of you.

142
00:21:27,218 --> 00:21:28,928
Where were you Vince.

143
00:21:29,137 --> 00:21:32,014
Guys are all over the favelas
asking about you.

144
00:21:32,015 --> 00:21:33,933
Couldn't get out of there without
leading them straight to you.

145
00:21:33,934 --> 00:21:35,992
Had to wait them out.

146
00:21:35,993 --> 00:21:39,621
That is such a horse shit,
that was your job.

147
00:21:39,689 --> 00:21:43,066
Enough O'Conner! If he said he
didn't do it, he didn't do it.

148
00:21:43,567 --> 00:21:46,445
Go walk it off.

149
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:02,711
Look, I would love to expand my
operations in your country.

150
00:22:02,712 --> 00:22:04,422
But quite frankly.

151
00:22:04,631 --> 00:22:07,300
Your business methods are too ??.

152
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:08,467
Let me tell you true story

153
00:22:08,468 --> 00:22:11,137
500 years ago

154
00:22:11,346 --> 00:22:14,015
Portuguese and spanish came here.

155
00:22:14,224 --> 00:22:18,224
Each trying to get the
country from the natives.

156
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:23,530
The spanish arrive guns blazing,
determined to prove who is boss.

157
00:22:25,694 --> 00:22:29,694
But, the natives killed every
single spaniard.

158
00:22:31,449 --> 00:22:35,078
Personally, I prefer the
methods of the portuguese.

159
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:36,997
They came bearing gifts.

160
00:22:37,205 --> 00:22:42,065
Mirrors, scissors, things that the
native couldn't get own their own.

161
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:47,755
But, to continue receiving them they
had to work for the Portuguese.

162
00:22:47,756 --> 00:22:51,756
And that's why all Brazilians
speak Portuguese today.

163
00:22:52,553 --> 00:22:58,063
Now, if you dominate the people with
violence, they will eventually fight back.

164
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:01,020
Because, they have nothing to lose.

165
00:23:01,228 --> 00:23:03,897
And, that's the key

166
00:23:04,106 --> 00:23:06,941
I go into the favelas, and give
them something to lose.

167
00:23:06,942 --> 00:23:10,942
Electricity, running water,
school room for their kids.

168
00:23:13,657 --> 00:23:16,337
And for that taste of the better life

169
00:23:16,535 --> 00:23:19,204
I own them.

170
00:23:20,372 --> 00:23:22,791
Gentlemen.

171
00:23:32,843 --> 00:23:36,013
Pardon me gentlemen.

172
00:23:49,151 --> 00:23:53,151
Almost wish I didn't see that.

173
00:23:54,907 --> 00:23:56,617
Almost.

174
00:23:56,825 --> 00:23:59,495
Wait, Dom

175
00:23:59,703 --> 00:24:02,373
Mia was on that train

176
00:24:02,581 --> 00:24:05,458
I didn't.....i didn't know
I wouldn't do anything to hurt her.

177
00:24:05,459 --> 00:24:08,879
You set off the deal

178
00:24:09,296 --> 00:24:11,214
I thought the job was for the cars

179
00:24:11,215 --> 00:24:15,215
I didn't know. All they
want is the chip.

180
00:24:16,011 --> 00:24:17,721
Damn.

181
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:20,599
You should have come clean.

182
00:24:20,808 --> 00:24:22,668
What's going on out here?

183
00:24:22,726 --> 00:24:24,436
- Nothing.
- Please, Dom.

184
00:24:24,645 --> 00:24:27,645
Just, let me have the chip. I can
take this to them.

185
00:24:27,746 --> 00:24:30,133
I'll give it to Reyes and set
things right.

186
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:32,987
Get out!

187
00:24:34,196 --> 00:24:35,948
What?

188
00:24:36,115 --> 00:24:38,742
Get out!

189
00:24:43,831 --> 00:24:46,500
You never listened to me.

190
00:24:46,709 --> 00:24:50,709
Not when I told you he was a cop
and not now.

191
00:24:51,505 --> 00:24:55,185
You never trust me.
Now, look where its gotten us.

192
00:24:55,342 --> 00:24:58,971
Look at our family now,
I can't go home.

193
00:24:59,179 --> 00:25:04,219
Your sister is stuck in this life
and where is Letty Dom?

194
00:25:05,853 --> 00:25:08,856
Where's Letty?

195
00:25:31,581 --> 00:25:32,781
Plasma car.

196
00:25:32,932 --> 00:25:37,450
Wilkes I want a list of every place
within 50 miles that distributes compressed gas tank.

197
00:25:37,551 --> 00:25:40,971
Pass me that evidence bag.

198
00:25:45,943 --> 00:25:47,861
Officer Neves, been waitin for you.

199
00:25:47,862 --> 00:25:49,722
- You asked for me ?
- I did.

200
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,491
May I ask, why?

201
00:25:52,658 --> 00:25:55,995
My smile is not that great.

202
00:25:57,455 --> 00:26:00,331
Your husband was an officer,
who was gunned down in the favela.

203
00:26:00,332 --> 00:26:04,169
Six months later you up and join the force?
You're motivated.

204
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:08,965
Plus I figure you're the only one in Rio
who can't be brought. Am I right?

205
00:26:08,966 --> 00:26:10,676
- Yes.
- Of course I am.

206
00:26:10,885 --> 00:26:15,135
Good new, bad news.
You know I like my dessert first.

207
00:26:15,681 --> 00:26:19,517
I checked the rail-Line like you asked, found a
couple of spots where they unloaded the cars.

208
00:26:19,518 --> 00:26:22,395
One set of tracks headed west until it hit
the main highway and then disappeared.

209
00:26:22,396 --> 00:26:26,191
And the another set of tracks headed east
170 inch wheel base, half inch track.

210
00:26:26,192 --> 00:26:29,507
The GT 40 ? -That was missing from the manifest.

211
00:26:29,682 --> 00:26:31,182
Followed the trail a couple
of miles.

212
00:26:31,608 --> 00:26:33,807
Pretty easy in this scrub. Can't
move without leaving signs.

213
00:26:33,908 --> 00:26:34,866
Give me the damn veggies.

214
00:26:34,867 --> 00:26:39,237
The ground rolls into a hard pack
and we lost that track too.

215
00:26:39,663 --> 00:26:41,373
Not necessarily.

216
00:26:41,582 --> 00:26:44,459
That road hits through
hill into the favelas.

217
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:49,255
Couple of years ago it was washed out by a storm.
So dirt from a mile from where you were.

218
00:26:49,256 --> 00:26:52,133
If they headed that way,
you'll pick up the tracks there.

219
00:26:52,134 --> 00:26:53,844
Come prepared?

220
00:26:54,053 --> 00:26:57,098
I'm motivated.

221
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:01,602
All right then, lets find ourselves a car.

222
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:33,175
What do you say?
Its definitely a custom chip.

223
00:27:33,384 --> 00:27:38,464
Look at all these side menus here,
for data entry. Lets check this one.

224
00:27:42,977 --> 00:27:46,607
Look at that. Same building,
same order every week.

225
00:27:46,772 --> 00:27:50,234
Its a delivery schedule.

226
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:14,592
Drugs? No, that's a dealer pack.

227
00:28:15,551 --> 00:28:19,429
See, the most major player they weigh their money
so they don't have to cost somebody to count it.

228
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:22,098
Right there that's 49 kilos.
49 kilos is a million in twenties.

229
00:28:22,099 --> 00:28:25,018
So, each one of these shipments
is worth 10 million dollars.

230
00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:27,354
Yeah.

231
00:28:48,167 --> 00:28:50,753
I thought so....

232
00:28:52,004 --> 00:28:56,004
So, what is that?
A 100 million plus in cash houses?

233
00:28:56,801 --> 00:28:58,671
That how he keeps it off the grid.

234
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:03,838
I think it's safe to say that Reyes is smart
to want this pack.

235
00:29:03,863 --> 00:29:07,563
I mean it's his whole network right there, just laid out on
the chip.

236
00:29:28,456 --> 00:29:31,333
Wilkes let's go up the middle,
rest flank north.

237
00:29:31,334 --> 00:29:33,044
What about me?

238
00:29:33,253 --> 00:29:34,053
Stay here.

239
00:31:23,530 --> 00:31:26,199
Police! On the ground!

240
00:31:26,408 --> 00:31:29,369
I got torreto.

241
00:31:33,123 --> 00:31:34,833
Hold your fire. Policio!

242
00:31:35,041 --> 00:31:38,211
They already know who you are.

243
00:32:06,698 --> 00:32:09,075
Let's go.

244
00:32:50,784 --> 00:32:53,453
You ok here ? Yeah.

245
00:32:53,661 --> 00:32:56,623
Almost, thank you.

246
00:33:28,696 --> 00:33:32,956
They are gonna be looking for the
three of us together now.

247
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:38,740
We need to split up. You and Mia head south
I'll lead them away.

248
00:33:38,748 --> 00:33:40,458
- No.
- Dom's right.

249
00:33:40,667 --> 00:33:43,669
We got lucky, but what happens next time?
We have no choice but to split up.

250
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:47,257
I'm pregnant.

251
00:33:49,676 --> 00:33:53,986
I already lost my family once
I'm not going thru that again.

252
00:33:55,014 --> 00:33:57,892
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

253
00:34:02,689 --> 00:34:06,689
I'm not going anywhere. Ok.

254
00:34:08,445 --> 00:34:12,445
Dom, promise me we stick together.

255
00:34:18,997 --> 00:34:21,499
I promise.

256
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:29,257
Family just got bigger...he he.

257
00:34:44,898 --> 00:34:46,708
Something doesn't add up.

258
00:34:46,816 --> 00:34:48,526
Toretto and O'Conner...

259
00:34:48,735 --> 00:34:53,530
They stay when they are supposed to run
They steal gas and then give it away?

260
00:34:53,531 --> 00:34:56,408
And now they're killing
federal agents?

261
00:34:56,409 --> 00:35:00,246
It doesn't make any sense.
Here's what makes sense.

262
00:35:03,917 --> 00:35:07,497
All these guys names are names on a list.
They come up, we take'em down.

263
00:35:07,598 --> 00:35:09,872
Not a phone call more, not a bullet less.

264
00:35:09,898 --> 00:35:12,609
Wilkes! We get anything?

265
00:35:12,675 --> 00:35:15,552
Standard forensics, sweep prints,
hair fibers. Prints are all over the car.

266
00:35:15,553 --> 00:35:16,512
Anything else?

267
00:35:16,513 --> 00:35:19,389
Yeah, we track the owner
off the vehicle ID.

268
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:26,146
They are couple of shell companies in between a
corporation owned by a investor named Hernan Reyes.

269
00:35:26,147 --> 00:35:27,857
Investor?

270
00:35:28,066 --> 00:35:31,902
If there is anything illegal
happening in Rio, Reyes is involved.

271
00:35:31,903 --> 00:35:32,861
Okay, then so are we.

272
00:35:32,862 --> 00:35:35,739
If you get us any closer to our guys,
I want every thing on em.

273
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:38,616
Chato, be on the roof. I want you on watch
in case somebody comes back for something

274
00:35:38,617 --> 00:35:42,453
Mac give me a cross-Check on Reyes, full specs, he goes
to the john, I want to know how many times he shakes it.

275
00:35:42,454 --> 00:35:45,707
You got it boss.

276
00:35:47,209 --> 00:35:49,920
Lets put all this mess back together.

277
00:35:50,087 --> 00:35:52,964
Well, that's gonna take a while.
Then you better get started.

278
00:35:52,965 --> 00:35:54,882
They were taking this
car apart for a reason.

279
00:35:54,883 --> 00:35:58,883
Lets put it back together
and find out whats missing.

280
00:36:23,662 --> 00:36:27,416
Hey Dom, what do you remember
about your father?

281
00:36:28,459 --> 00:36:31,170
My father...

282
00:36:33,992 --> 00:36:40,528
He used to....he used to
have a barbeque every sunday after church.

283
00:36:41,029 --> 00:36:44,658
For everybody in the neighbourhood.

284
00:36:44,867 --> 00:36:48,703
If we didn't go to church
we didn't get any barbeque.

285
00:36:48,704 --> 00:36:51,373
Every single day he was in the shop.

286
00:36:51,582 --> 00:36:57,952
And, every single night he was at the kitchen
table with Mia helping her with her homework.

287
00:36:58,297 --> 00:37:05,137
Even after she went to sleep he would
stay up for few more hours.

288
00:37:05,138 --> 00:37:08,538
So he could learn the next
chapter and help her the next day.

289
00:37:08,807 --> 00:37:11,560
I remember everything about my father.

290
00:37:11,727 --> 00:37:14,104
Everything.

291
00:37:14,605 --> 00:37:16,315
That's just it.

292
00:37:16,523 --> 00:37:19,860
I don't remember shit about my dad.

293
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:25,156
I don't remember him yelling,
I don't remember him smiling.

294
00:37:25,157 --> 00:37:29,952
To be honest with you, I don't even
remember what the hell he looked like.

295
00:37:29,953 --> 00:37:36,453
I don't remember him...he was just
never there.

296
00:37:37,628 --> 00:37:41,340
You ain't gonna be like that Brian.

297
00:37:55,812 --> 00:37:58,524
We can't keep running Dom.

298
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:00,442
We got to get out.

299
00:38:00,609 --> 00:38:03,320
We got to get out, now.

300
00:38:03,487 --> 00:38:06,114
You're right.

301
00:38:15,999 --> 00:38:19,628
This is how we're gonna do it.

302
00:38:21,755 --> 00:38:25,631
We are gonna use this.
We're gonna do one last job.

303
00:38:25,632 --> 00:38:27,643
We are gonna take all of Reyes' money.

304
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:30,910
Every dime of it.

305
00:38:31,306 --> 00:38:38,752
And disappear .. forever.

306
00:38:38,981 --> 00:38:42,817
New passports, new lives,
no more looking over our shoulder.

307
00:38:42,818 --> 00:38:44,735
- And we're gonna buy our freedom.
- That's right.

308
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:47,613
You realize we're talking about going up
against the most powerful guy in all of Rio.

309
00:38:47,614 --> 00:38:49,825
Yes, we are.

310
00:38:50,492 --> 00:38:53,954
Then we're gonna need a team.

311
00:38:59,168 --> 00:39:01,085
Alright, lets run through the bases
real quick.

312
00:39:01,086 --> 00:39:02,044
Who do we got?

313
00:39:02,045 --> 00:39:05,840
First, we're gonna need a chameleon.
Someone who can blend in.

314
00:39:05,841 --> 00:39:08,343
Anywhere.

315
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:09,519
What else?

316
00:39:09,678 --> 00:39:14,178
A fast talker. Someone who can
bullshit their way out of anything.

317
00:39:14,474 --> 00:39:17,144
I got that.

318
00:39:17,352 --> 00:39:23,107
This guys gonna have a lot of surveillance. We're
gonna need someone who's good with circuits.

319
00:39:23,108 --> 00:39:25,026
And with those circuits,
Reyes is gonna have walls.

320
00:39:25,027 --> 00:39:29,287
We're gonna need guys
to punch through those walls.

321
00:39:29,482 --> 00:39:32,600
- What else?
- Utilities and weapons.

322
00:39:32,701 --> 00:39:38,037
Someone who ain't afraid to throw down.
Someone to backup every position.

323
00:39:38,138 --> 00:39:40,338
Yeah? What else we need?

324
00:39:40,394 --> 00:39:44,170
Most importantly we're gonna
need two precision drivers.

325
00:39:44,171 --> 00:39:46,924
Guys who don't crack under pressure.

326
00:39:47,049 --> 00:39:49,801
Guys who never lose.

327
00:39:49,968 --> 00:39:53,096
You know we got that.

328
00:40:17,788 --> 00:40:20,207
Ah... hell nah

329
00:40:20,666 --> 00:40:23,501
I see they really scraped the
bottom of the barrel ..Huh

330
00:40:23,502 --> 00:40:27,172
I guess they did, since your ass is here.

331
00:40:27,339 --> 00:40:30,216
When you gonna give Martin
Luther King his car back?

332
00:40:30,217 --> 00:40:32,517
As soon as you give Rick James
his jacket back.

333
00:40:34,442 --> 00:40:36,442
- Whaddup man.
- Whaddup.

334
00:40:49,403 --> 00:40:51,113
Sexy legs baby girl.

335
00:40:51,321 --> 00:40:53,031
What time do they open?

336
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:57,240
They open the same time
as I pull this trigger.

337
00:40:58,036 --> 00:41:01,540
Want me to open them?

338
00:41:09,269 --> 00:41:13,269
Yeah anybody can talk shit
in spanish, homey.

339
00:41:16,321 --> 00:41:18,991
Two fails, I am not fail.....two fails.

340
00:41:19,199 --> 00:41:22,077
Who are these clowns man?
Circus clowns.

341
00:41:23,888 --> 00:41:25,888
I thought cock fights were illegal
in Brazil.

342
00:41:25,914 --> 00:41:27,714
I see, you've all met.

343
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:29,584
There he is.

344
00:41:29,751 --> 00:41:37,101
You know when you called me to come to Rio, I assumed
it would be for something more exciting than this.

345
00:41:39,279 --> 00:41:41,279
- I missed you man.
- I missed you too.

346
00:41:41,305 --> 00:41:45,099
This is Tej, the best
circuit man on the east coast.

347
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:48,936
This is my boy Roman Pearce, we go way back.
I met this cat in juvi.

348
00:41:48,937 --> 00:41:50,855
I pulled that job with him Miami.

349
00:41:50,856 --> 00:41:55,176
I heard about you.
- Nice digs.

350
00:41:55,201 --> 00:41:56,751
Yeah, well the Ritz was sold out.

351
00:41:56,752 --> 00:41:58,522
So, whats this all about Dom?

352
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:01,406
Yeah man, why'd you drag us
half way around the world.

353
00:42:01,407 --> 00:42:04,076
Cause we got a job.

354
00:42:04,285 --> 00:42:07,155
Alright, so target's name is Hernan Reyes.

355
00:42:07,163 --> 00:42:09,080
He runs the drug scene out there.

356
00:42:09,081 --> 00:42:10,999
He has never been busted because
he doesn't leave a paper trail.

357
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,836
No paper trails means no banks.
No banks means cash houses.

358
00:42:14,837 --> 00:42:15,495
That's right.

359
00:42:17,096 --> 00:42:19,242
Tell him what we do Jack.
Its spread throughout the city.

360
00:42:20,593 --> 00:42:24,263
And we're gonna hit em all.

361
00:42:24,388 --> 00:42:25,347
- All of em.
- All of em.

362
00:42:25,348 --> 00:42:31,588
Sounds crazy. Bring us to whole nother country
so we can rob the dude who runs it.

363
00:42:32,104 --> 00:42:33,974
I thought this is business.

364
00:42:34,023 --> 00:42:36,692
Sounds personal to me.

365
00:42:36,901 --> 00:42:39,695
Is that what this is?

366
00:42:40,038 --> 00:42:42,915
I got love for you all,
but personal ain't good business.

367
00:42:43,616 --> 00:42:46,786
I can't do this homie.

368
00:42:47,453 --> 00:42:51,363
So, what we're talking about
is a 100 million dollars.

369
00:42:52,249 --> 00:42:54,919
You say what ? Hun...hun...

370
00:42:55,127 --> 00:42:58,964
See, sometimes I be over thinking man
and I know .we just met...but.

371
00:42:58,965 --> 00:42:59,923
You just kinda...gotta.

372
00:42:59,924 --> 00:43:00,882
A 100 million dollars.

373
00:43:00,883 --> 00:43:04,636
And everything we take,
we split even.

374
00:43:04,637 --> 00:43:07,657
So, that's over 11 million a piece,
I am down

375
00:43:08,474 --> 00:43:10,893
I'm in.

376
00:43:11,352 --> 00:43:16,788
11 million? Sounds like a whole
lotta vaginal activity to me.

377
00:43:16,789 --> 00:43:20,225
You can't pull off all ten heists
on the same mark, you just can't.

378
00:43:20,326 --> 00:43:23,763
Yeah, as soon as we hit the first one they're gonna
do everything they can to protect their asses.

379
00:43:23,864 --> 00:43:26,450
Exactly.

380
00:44:18,544 --> 00:44:19,502
That's all of it.

381
00:44:19,503 --> 00:44:22,233
You're dead men. You're all dead men.

382
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:25,343
You don't have a place to hide.

383
00:44:26,177 --> 00:44:28,429
Who's hiding?

384
00:44:28,495 --> 00:44:32,072
Are you crazy ? Are you crazy?
Do you know whose house this is?

385
00:44:32,273 --> 00:44:36,210
Whose money are you stealing?

386
00:44:43,444 --> 00:44:46,614
We ain't stealin it.

387
00:44:53,996 --> 00:44:57,625
You tell your boss, exactly who did this.

388
00:44:57,833 --> 00:45:01,833
Tell him there's more coming.

389
00:45:04,507 --> 00:45:06,300
Voila ...

390
00:45:06,425 --> 00:45:08,970
Turn it over.

391
00:45:13,182 --> 00:45:17,410
Its running on all eight,
checks out fine.

392
00:45:18,938 --> 00:45:21,607
Keep looking.

393
00:45:22,775 --> 00:45:26,775
Boss, if something was missing
we'd know.

394
00:45:51,512 --> 00:45:54,973
Its a goddamn shame to put bullshit
like that on a classic.

395
00:45:54,974 --> 00:45:58,974
Might as well slap neon lights on it.

396
00:46:06,902 --> 00:46:08,613
They took the chip.

397
00:46:08,821 --> 00:46:11,490
We got a hit on the police scanner.

398
00:46:11,699 --> 00:46:13,610
Armed robbery at a house in Leblon.

399
00:46:13,635 --> 00:46:17,535
I just cross checked against a property
owned by Reyes Corporation.

400
00:46:17,636 --> 00:46:19,872
Alright if that's our guys then whatever was
on that chip led them directly to that house.

401
00:46:19,973 --> 00:46:21,125
Its them for sure.

402
00:46:21,167 --> 00:46:27,057
How do you know that ? - Because no one
else in Rio is stupid enough to rob Reyes.

403
00:48:08,065 --> 00:48:11,235
Number 1 is on the move man.

404
00:48:23,456 --> 00:48:26,625
Two is on the move.

405
00:48:49,314 --> 00:48:51,858
I got mine

406
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:13,338
I got eyes on five.

407
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:41,115
I know you all said they were consolidating
the money somewhere, but ...

408
00:49:41,116 --> 00:49:44,494
Y'all ain't gonna believe this.

409
00:49:53,586 --> 00:49:56,386
Well this job just got a lot harder.

410
00:49:56,464 --> 00:50:02,584
If he's moving it into a police station he's
got some serious brass in his pocket.

411
00:50:03,179 --> 00:50:04,138
Hell yeah, we can't do this.

412
00:50:04,139 --> 00:50:07,684
Can't you mean shouldn't.

413
00:50:07,976 --> 00:50:11,229
I think this doesn't change a thing.

414
00:50:13,732 --> 00:50:15,649
I say we stick to the plan.

415
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:21,690
You say wha...this just went from mission
impossible to mission infreakin' sanity.

416
00:50:22,365 --> 00:50:24,075
Whatever man!

417
00:50:24,284 --> 00:50:28,234
I ain't scared. I'm just lettin y'all know..
Going in that building is crazy.

418
00:50:28,259 --> 00:50:29,459
I got this.

419
00:50:31,958 --> 00:50:33,216
What time was the robbery.

420
00:50:33,417 --> 00:50:35,711
Around 11' o clock.

421
00:50:36,755 --> 00:50:39,341
Here we go.

422
00:50:40,592 --> 00:50:42,969
Enhance it.

423
00:50:43,428 --> 00:50:46,640
Their faces are covered.
Run it through FRS.

424
00:50:52,103 --> 00:50:54,689
Well, hello you son of a bitch.

425
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:01,695
Wilkes, run the photos of known associates of Torretto and
O'Conner against customs entries into Brazil in the last 2 weeks.

426
00:51:01,696 --> 00:51:06,976
Check planes, trains, boats and everything
short of the goddamn space shuttle.

427
00:51:11,289 --> 00:51:14,166
They can change their names
but, they can't change their faces.

428
00:51:14,167 --> 00:51:17,504
Something big is going down.

429
00:51:18,004 --> 00:51:18,963
That's a 1970 charger.

430
00:51:18,964 --> 00:51:19,764
Let's go.

431
00:51:19,923 --> 00:51:22,481
Upload these specs into the database
have the computer cross check them with.

432
00:51:20,882 --> 00:51:25,452
The overhead satellites at every 15 minutes.
Stand behind in two.

433
00:51:25,637 --> 00:51:30,657
If these vehicles move on the streets
of Rio, I wanna know about it.

434
00:51:38,382 --> 00:51:39,582
Everything ok ?

435
00:51:40,507 --> 00:51:42,207
This Federal Agent ??

436
00:51:43,581 --> 00:51:45,581
A gringo.

437
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:53,707
He requested a rookie patrol officer as
his assistant.

438
00:52:47,052 --> 00:52:50,221
The beauty of public offices.

439
00:52:50,889 --> 00:52:52,599
Public records.

440
00:52:52,807 --> 00:52:57,603
This is where he's keeping the money.
The vault in the evidence room.

441
00:52:57,604 --> 00:53:03,359
Yeah..Um. Can I get everyone's attention right here for a
second, we are talkin about breaking into a po-lice station.

442
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:07,072
Is anyone listening to those words?
Anybody? Po-Po.

443
00:53:09,115 --> 00:53:11,033
Five-O, One time, pigs
people we don't like.

444
00:53:11,034 --> 00:53:13,911
You know police stations are designed
to keep people in not out.

445
00:53:13,912 --> 00:53:17,748
That's why its a stealth mission.
We'll be in and out before they even know we're there.

446
00:53:17,749 --> 00:53:19,625
Well, we need to get eyes in there.

447
00:53:19,626 --> 00:53:23,463
At least, to find out the make
and model of that vault.

448
00:53:26,341 --> 00:53:30,220
Who's the folks you know, do all this.

449
00:53:37,894 --> 00:53:39,604
Wait...wha do you mean?

450
00:53:39,713 --> 00:53:41,423
Why me?

451
00:53:41,631 --> 00:53:44,968
Cause you got the biggest mouth.

452
00:53:45,102 --> 00:53:46,812
That's for damn sure.

453
00:53:56,021 --> 00:53:58,856
Hello beautiful......look at those dimples
sexy.........sexy.

454
00:53:58,857 --> 00:54:00,774
Love those glasses,
where did you get them from.

455
00:54:00,775 --> 00:54:03,987
Are those like gucci frames or somethin?

456
00:54:04,613 --> 00:54:07,282
No, no...

457
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:08,449
Who are you sir?

458
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:12,286
Special agent O'Conner.
Us federal bureo of investigation.

459
00:54:12,287 --> 00:54:14,998
It says caucasian?

460
00:54:15,165 --> 00:54:17,615
Well, its the tan....you know tan.

461
00:54:20,921 --> 00:54:24,798
Look....i am working this case
and I got some evidence here to be held.

462
00:54:24,799 --> 00:54:26,717
But I need to get in....and check your
storage facility first.

463
00:54:26,718 --> 00:54:29,954
- Nope.
- Look man I know you're a true professional ..

464
00:54:29,955 --> 00:54:31,354
and I respect you, I promise.

465
00:54:30,555 --> 00:54:38,187
You know...it look like you workout a little bit too.
What you benchmark 3-350.

466
00:54:38,188 --> 00:54:43,265
Look I'm just tryin to do my job man. My boss
sent me here to just make sure everything was safe.

467
00:54:43,266 --> 00:54:45,643
It will be safe. - Ok..Well let me
just come in and take a quick peek.

468
00:54:45,644 --> 00:54:46,813
- Nope.
- Come on man.

469
00:54:46,821 --> 00:54:48,880
Hook a brother up please.

470
00:54:48,881 --> 00:54:50,997
- Nope. And you are not my brother.

471
00:54:51,098 --> 00:54:53,016
Brother from another mother?

472
00:54:53,617 --> 00:54:55,135
Look..No one enters the facility
but authorized evidence personnel.

473
00:54:55,136 --> 00:54:56,446
Now stop wasting my time. I'm going to
call the embassy.

474
00:54:55,454 --> 00:54:56,412
I am going to call
the embassy. No...no, no.

475
00:54:57,613 --> 00:54:59,290
We good...we don't need to call them..For
what?

476
00:54:59,291 --> 00:55:00,091
We good.

477
00:55:00,251 --> 00:55:03,127
Here, I got the box.
We all good, I promise you.

478
00:55:03,128 --> 00:55:05,840
Thank you so much for your time

479
00:55:06,006 --> 00:55:13,456
I swear to god, if you was on the other side of that
glass I'd bust your damn face in .. now translate that.

480
00:55:28,070 --> 00:55:32,730
You see, I think I make a better
special agent than you ever did.

481
00:55:32,867 --> 00:55:36,867
Well, that depends on how you
define special.

482
00:55:37,663 --> 00:55:41,663
C'mon man, lets see what we got.
That's funny.

483
00:55:48,093 --> 00:55:49,263
Alright come on.

484
00:55:53,971 --> 00:55:59,684
Yo, you still can't drive. See that .. now I
see why you always gettin into accidents.

485
00:55:59,685 --> 00:56:02,385
You can't even drive a damn
remote control car.

486
00:56:02,485 --> 00:56:04,062
I don't need this, I don't ..
-Its crazy.
-Shut up right now.

487
00:56:04,063 --> 00:56:07,583
- I am not gonna shut up...
- Man, strap him in his safety belt man.

488
00:56:10,279 --> 00:56:16,034
Give me the remote...go left. It looks like
something right over there to the left...what is that?

489
00:56:16,035 --> 00:56:17,745
Bingo.

490
00:56:17,953 --> 00:56:20,623
What is that ? 6 x 6?

491
00:56:20,831 --> 00:56:22,541
8 x 12

492
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:29,661
7 x 12. 18-Inch thick steel. Reenforced walls, with
insulated copper core to protect it against thermal lens.

493
00:56:29,662 --> 00:56:34,852
The class 3 electronic lock with a sure fire ?? tumbler.
And a biometric palm scanner.

494
00:56:35,221 --> 00:56:37,138
Ten tons of top of the line security.

495
00:56:37,139 --> 00:56:41,139
Do I wanna know, how you know all that?

496
00:56:41,187 --> 00:56:42,752
I had a life before you know me O'Conner.
Lets just leave it with that, alright.

497
00:56:42,853 --> 00:56:44,605
She is a beauty, though.

498
00:56:44,772 --> 00:56:46,482
Beauty as in good?

499
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:49,567
Beauty as in you know...
start off playing hard to get.

500
00:56:49,568 --> 00:56:57,658
And, no matter how much I caress her, no matter how much I
love her in the end she still ain't gonna give up that ass.

501
00:57:02,383 --> 00:57:04,883
Two to one says you blow the wrong pipe.

502
00:57:04,908 --> 00:57:08,108
Yo, why you gotta be so negative
all the time?

503
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,333
I ain't negative.

504
00:57:10,558 --> 00:57:12,058
I'm just positive you're going to
mess it up.

505
00:57:13,083 --> 00:57:15,183
I'm telling you, you've
got issues.

506
00:57:21,208 --> 00:57:23,708
Next time, if there's no elevator,
I'm not coming.

507
00:57:24,733 --> 00:57:26,233
You need to learn to relax, loco .

508
00:57:47,058 --> 00:57:49,558
You better hurry up, we got less than
a minute.

509
00:57:50,583 --> 00:57:56,383
Why do you always set the timer
so short ?

510
00:57:56,408 --> 00:57:57,608
Vaminos.

511
00:58:17,956 --> 00:58:19,956
I hope you know where you're going.

512
00:58:20,082 --> 00:58:23,136
I got this....relax man relax.

513
00:58:34,961 --> 00:58:36,661
.. a police station.

514
00:58:38,086 --> 00:58:39,286
Relax.

515
00:58:50,511 --> 00:58:52,511
You used too much explosive! Again.

516
00:58:53,336 --> 00:58:54,936
Too much .. too little ..

517
00:58:55,861 --> 00:58:57,861
It's all the same.

518
00:58:57,986 --> 00:59:01,986
That's some Buddha shit you learned from a
book in the prison library, isn't it?

519
00:59:02,911 --> 00:59:04,911
And what you're doing there on the wall ..

520
00:59:04,936 --> 00:59:06,936
You got that from the same book, huh ?

521
00:59:07,561 --> 00:59:09,561
You're so negative.

522
00:59:38,362 --> 00:59:41,073
Got it...we got it.

523
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:43,199
Yeah...we are looking at four cameras.

524
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:47,037
Now, that's some high end shit too.
Marker optics.

525
00:59:47,997 --> 00:59:51,208
100 degree field of view,
10 seconds oscillation.

526
00:59:52,793 --> 00:59:53,751
Nah...that's a narrow window man?

527
00:59:53,752 --> 00:59:56,629
Can we just stop the scanner
and replace the image.

528
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:58,506
Nah...its hooked  into a digital sync.
They'd know we were in the system.

529
00:59:58,507 --> 01:00:00,425
The best we can do is peek.

530
01:00:00,426 --> 01:00:03,043
We're gonna need some real
fast cars to get thru this.

531
01:00:03,144 --> 01:00:06,662
And, not just fast... we've got a
hard right and a hair pin.

532
01:00:06,663 --> 01:00:08,933
We need something agile.

533
01:00:09,059 --> 01:00:10,919
You guys mark up a track.

534
01:00:10,978 --> 01:00:14,978
O'Conner, lets go get some cars.

535
01:00:15,122 --> 01:00:23,122
.Interval...Go have something!
//subs dedicated to ma mom and bumbo//.

536
01:00:52,228 --> 01:00:55,397
Home...sweet home.

537
01:01:12,373 --> 01:01:15,041
Or that.

538
01:01:15,068 --> 01:01:19,044
How about that?, all motor no tuning issues?
I always wanted one of those.

539
01:01:19,045 --> 01:01:23,045
Held the record on the
avenida 3 years running.

540
01:01:23,842 --> 01:01:26,718
You got a lot of bones to bring
your problems here torreto.

541
01:01:26,719 --> 01:01:30,390
Not to mention a cop.

542
01:01:30,598 --> 01:01:33,852
Yeah, we can keep that on the low.

543
01:01:33,913 --> 01:01:36,690
Word on the street is that a
lot of people are looking for you two.

544
01:01:36,791 --> 01:01:41,120
What, you didn't think
we'd recognise you.

545
01:01:41,228 --> 01:01:43,828
Well, we were kinda counting on it.

546
01:01:44,177 --> 01:01:51,277
That little coupe may run the streets around here but
that monster has never seen a set of tail lights, ever.

547
01:01:51,278 --> 01:01:53,513
Well she's about to.

548
01:01:54,738 --> 01:01:56,738
Dominic Toretto's ride, in my garage.

549
01:01:58,863 --> 01:02:00,863
Now that .. will be a nice trophy.

550
01:02:01,254 --> 01:02:04,257
Lets go .. legend.

551
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:07,760
Car for car.

552
01:02:07,969 --> 01:02:09,679
Car for car?

553
01:02:09,888 --> 01:02:13,641
If you want it, come and get it.

554
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:25,820
Really?

555
01:02:26,237 --> 01:02:29,907
Where'd you get that from?
Poppa's market.

556
01:02:30,074 --> 01:02:33,995
Ok O'Conner, give it your best shot.

557
01:02:54,015 --> 01:02:56,684
- How was that one ?
- Camera caught you.

558
01:02:56,893 --> 01:02:59,770
- What?
- Yeah it still caught you.

559
01:02:59,771 --> 01:03:01,870
And I was milkin the hell out of that
thing too.

560
01:03:02,071 --> 01:03:05,699
We're gonna need a faster car.

561
01:03:08,924 --> 01:03:10,924
I want my money .. c'mon.

562
01:03:26,631 --> 01:03:29,591
Exactly why your ass ain't been
driving. Terrible.

563
01:03:39,102 --> 01:03:42,355
I think I'm in love.

564
01:03:44,858 --> 01:03:48,694
That was a real solid work.
I think camera 3 still caught you though.

565
01:03:48,695 --> 01:03:51,948
Let's do it again.

566
01:03:59,205 --> 01:04:02,709
That's the piggy bank you ordered?
You kiddin me ?

567
01:04:03,042 --> 01:04:05,832
Where in the hell can I get one of these?

568
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:10,550
Well we had a life
before you met us.

569
01:04:10,758 --> 01:04:12,676
Alright, well I get to work
on the electronics tunneler.

570
01:04:12,677 --> 01:04:15,346
But there's still another problem.

571
01:04:15,555 --> 01:04:17,265
Palm scanner.

572
01:04:17,473 --> 01:04:21,310
And without Reyes' hand print,
Houdini himself couldn't open this bitch.

573
01:04:21,311 --> 01:04:23,228
How do you know its Reyes' hand print?

574
01:04:23,229 --> 01:04:25,147
You got 100 million dollars in a safe.

575
01:04:25,148 --> 01:04:28,693
You gonna put somebody
else's hand print on it.

576
01:04:29,518 --> 01:04:31,518
There you go with that negativity.

577
01:04:34,759 --> 01:04:37,835
How are we supposed to get
Reyes's hand print?

578
01:04:38,536 --> 01:04:41,539
Han, you're up.

579
01:04:42,373 --> 01:04:45,084
Sure, gotta make the easy stuff.

580
01:04:45,251 --> 01:04:48,546
Lets go, I 'll drive.

581
01:05:04,479 --> 01:05:05,437
That makes six bodyguards.

582
01:05:05,438 --> 01:05:09,808
Seven, do you think that guy with
a fanny pack is a tourist?

583
01:05:15,031 --> 01:05:18,535
So, how long were you in the army?

584
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:21,960
That gun you pulled the other day was
a Jericho 941.

585
01:05:25,542 --> 01:05:32,022
I got out of the military probably the same
time you quit smoking.

586
01:05:32,257 --> 01:05:34,174
The amount of chips you eat.

587
01:05:34,175 --> 01:05:38,011
The way you always have to keep
your hands and mouth busy.

588
01:05:38,012 --> 01:05:41,641
You were a two pack a day man.
For sure.

589
01:05:41,850 --> 01:05:44,477
Unfiltered.

590
01:05:47,605 --> 01:05:49,357
Well, this is a bust.

591
01:05:49,524 --> 01:05:53,194
How you gonna get Reyes
fingerprints out of here.

592
01:05:53,361 --> 01:05:55,279
We need to do some more recon.

593
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,031
Call in a couple extra guys.

594
01:05:57,198 --> 01:06:01,119
Uh uh. You don't send a man
to do a woman's job.

595
01:06:54,756 --> 01:06:57,884
We gonna figure this out, I promise you.

596
01:07:00,512 --> 01:07:03,097
Whats that?

597
01:07:03,389 --> 01:07:05,307
I thought she was more of a thong man?

598
01:07:05,308 --> 01:07:07,018
We got the prints.

599
01:07:07,227 --> 01:07:09,479
Where?

600
01:07:11,064 --> 01:07:13,942
Ok. That's crazy.

601
01:07:14,901 --> 01:07:16,818
So, did he just like slap that ass.

602
01:07:16,819 --> 01:07:19,989
Or, did he like grab and hold on to it?

603
01:07:21,574 --> 01:07:24,118
Yeah..Hey...this will work.

604
01:07:24,452 --> 01:07:26,202
I'm impressed. - Got it?

605
01:07:26,371 --> 01:07:30,371
Got it. But, you still
didn't answer the question.

606
01:07:35,964 --> 01:07:37,881
Guys...guys...guys....we have a problem.

607
01:07:37,882 --> 01:07:41,881
- The whole team just got burnt.
- Now we're all wanted.

608
01:07:44,638 --> 01:07:46,348
Hang on a second.

609
01:07:46,557 --> 01:07:49,433
Us diplomatic security service
issued the warrants.

610
01:07:49,434 --> 01:07:52,187
Agent L.Hobbs.
Hold on a second.

611
01:07:53,272 --> 01:07:55,649
Hey Dom,

612
01:07:56,149 --> 01:07:59,778
Is that the guy you saw in the favela?

613
01:07:59,945 --> 01:08:01,697
Yeah.

614
01:08:01,864 --> 01:08:04,740
Hobbs is the leader of the
elite task force for the DSS.

615
01:08:04,741 --> 01:08:06,451
So he's good.

616
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:09,178
When the FBI wants to find somebody
that's who they call.

617
01:08:08,579 --> 01:08:11,248
Because he never misses his mark.

618
01:08:11,456 --> 01:08:14,126
This guy is....he's old testament.

619
01:08:14,334 --> 01:08:17,211
Blood, bullets, rap the GOD
that's his style.

620
01:08:17,212 --> 01:08:19,130
And right now he's hunting us?

621
01:08:19,131 --> 01:08:21,848
Dom, we gotta move up
our time line.

622
01:08:21,049 --> 01:08:22,759
Yeah, but how?

623
01:08:22,968 --> 01:08:26,938
This thing has already been difficult
without Wyatt Earp on our ass.

624
01:08:26,805 --> 01:08:29,682
If anything ..
We need more room to breathe.

625
01:08:29,683 --> 01:08:32,561
Roman's right.

626
01:08:34,479 --> 01:08:38,479
I think we need to get some fresh air.

627
01:08:40,235 --> 01:08:43,087
I've got a hit. We've got his Charger

628
01:08:43,154 --> 01:08:45,531
Let's get a move on.

629
01:08:48,156 --> 01:08:50,556
East bound on 90.

630
01:08:50,787 --> 01:08:53,749
Move....move....move

631
01:08:58,462 --> 01:09:00,379
Stopped...about a block ahead.

632
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:03,550
Park it...we're going on foot.

633
01:09:24,321 --> 01:09:26,740
Hey .. Toretto.

634
01:09:32,996 --> 01:09:34,706
You're under arrest.

635
01:09:34,915 --> 01:09:36,625
Arrest?

636
01:09:36,834 --> 01:09:39,504
I don't feel like I'm under arrest.

637
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:40,670
How about you brian?

638
01:09:40,671 --> 01:09:43,257
Nah .. not a bit.

639
01:09:43,549 --> 01:09:48,439
- Not even a little bit.
- I'll just give it a minute .. it'll sink in.

640
01:09:50,264 --> 01:09:52,181
We didn't kill those feds.

641
01:09:52,182 --> 01:09:54,100
- That was Reyes.
- I don't give a shit.

642
01:09:54,101 --> 01:09:57,895
Just here to bring in two assholes
whose names hit my desk.

643
01:09:57,896 --> 01:10:01,733
Yeah, that's sound like a real hero.

644
01:10:02,693 --> 01:10:04,444
That's funny.

645
01:10:04,611 --> 01:10:09,825
From a guy who took the oath of a cop and
then went against everything he stood for?

646
01:10:09,826 --> 01:10:12,285
Or, some wanna be tough guy prick who beat
a man half to death with a socket rinch.

647
01:10:12,286 --> 01:10:14,037
That's real tough.

648
01:10:14,204 --> 01:10:18,204
You turn around and put
your hands behind your back.

649
01:10:19,001 --> 01:10:24,591
- I don't think so.
- You're mistaken to think you got a goddamn choice boy.

650
01:10:27,676 --> 01:10:31,676
Your mistake ? Thinking you're in America.

651
01:10:33,432 --> 01:10:36,643
You're a long way from home.

652
01:10:39,146 --> 01:10:42,149
This is Brazil!

653
01:10:55,454 --> 01:10:59,082
Come on boss, another day.

654
01:10:59,291 --> 01:11:03,128
Come on, it's a lotta heat.

655
01:11:06,965 --> 01:11:10,636
I'll see you soon, Toretto.

656
01:11:10,802 --> 01:11:14,056
I'm looking forward to it Hobbs.

657
01:11:48,215 --> 01:11:49,015
Yep.

658
01:11:49,174 --> 01:11:51,844
Tracker's on.

659
01:11:52,052 --> 01:11:54,638
Got em.

660
01:12:56,283 --> 01:12:58,994
I don't understand. Why come here?

661
01:12:59,161 --> 01:13:03,161
Why risk it all for
20 dollars worth of silver?

662
01:13:06,877 --> 01:13:09,880
Cause its worth it.

663
01:13:10,714 --> 01:13:12,464
You should run you know!

664
01:13:12,633 --> 01:13:15,594
Hobbs will find you.

665
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:19,470
You have every reason to leave. Why stay ?

666
01:13:26,995 --> 01:13:28,195
Why do you?

667
01:13:29,858 --> 01:13:37,488
My husband was a good police officer...an
honest man...we both grew up here.

668
01:13:37,533 --> 01:13:41,161
Three years ago, has was murdered in
the streets.

669
01:13:41,370 --> 01:13:44,122
Right outside our door.

670
01:13:45,207 --> 01:13:46,959
Reyes owns this favela now.

671
01:13:47,125 --> 01:13:49,837
He give things to people.

672
01:13:50,003 --> 01:13:53,465
And everything has a price.

673
01:13:55,759 --> 01:13:57,677
People here need a new start.

674
01:13:57,678 --> 01:14:00,556
They need to be free.

675
01:14:08,229 --> 01:14:12,229
You didn't killed those men in the train
did you?

676
01:14:15,903 --> 01:14:19,903
Now why would you believe anything
I'd tell you.

677
01:14:25,496 --> 01:14:27,623
Hey!

678
01:14:29,333 --> 01:14:33,333
Was she so special too?

679
01:14:36,048 --> 01:14:40,048
I never thought anyone could
understand how much.

680
01:14:40,803 --> 01:14:43,598
But you do.

681
01:15:16,255 --> 01:15:18,007
Close, but not enough.

682
01:15:18,174 --> 01:15:20,091
Time window's too small, man.

683
01:15:20,092 --> 01:15:24,122
The only way we're gonna beat the cameras,
is with .. invisible cars.

684
01:15:25,848 --> 01:15:29,143
And I know just where to get em.

685
01:15:30,645 --> 01:15:33,940
Lets take a ride boys.

686
01:15:39,278 --> 01:15:42,865
Don't hurt yourself.

687
01:15:59,423 --> 01:16:02,441
Its been a while since I've been behind
the wheel of one of these.

688
01:16:02,442 --> 01:16:06,196
First time I've  ever been in the
front seat.

689
01:16:10,935 --> 01:16:12,853
Hey, Rome, what took you so long.

690
01:16:12,854 --> 01:16:17,649
I thought for sure, you'd be showing up
with some chrome spinners or somethin.

691
01:16:17,650 --> 01:16:19,360
Ha.....hah....real funny

692
01:16:19,569 --> 01:16:23,405
I got a 100,000 that says I can
take you all in the next quarter mile.

693
01:16:23,406 --> 01:16:25,323
Yeah, your broke ass has got a 100 grand.

694
01:16:25,324 --> 01:16:28,035
If we pull off this job, I will.

695
01:16:28,202 --> 01:16:30,182
Next two lights, a 100,000.

696
01:16:32,039 --> 01:16:34,916
If we don't pull this job off,
we're probably dead anyway.

697
01:16:34,917 --> 01:16:36,669
Lets make it a million.

698
01:16:36,836 --> 01:16:38,588
I like that.

699
01:16:38,754 --> 01:16:40,672
Alright, million dollar quarter mile.

700
01:16:40,673 --> 01:16:42,425
Alright then.

701
01:16:42,592 --> 01:16:45,261
We only live once, lets do it.

702
01:16:45,469 --> 01:16:47,180
What do you say Dom?

703
01:16:47,388 --> 01:16:50,057
Are we talking or we racing?

704
01:16:50,266 --> 01:16:52,184
Just don't cheat this time.

705
01:16:52,185 --> 01:16:55,354
You gotta let that go.

706
01:18:10,805 --> 01:18:13,975
Yeah .. owned you .. owned you.

707
01:18:27,154 --> 01:18:31,117
- Good race, O'Conner.
- Thanks, Dom.

708
01:18:31,342 --> 01:18:33,342
You know how long I've been waitin
for that shit ?

709
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:35,620
I told you he didn't see it.

710
01:18:35,746 --> 01:18:36,705
The man right there!

711
01:18:36,706 --> 01:18:39,417
He let off the throttle at the mile.

712
01:18:39,584 --> 01:18:41,335
You didn't do nothing.

713
01:18:41,502 --> 01:18:43,254
He let you win.

714
01:18:43,421 --> 01:18:45,756
Bullshit.

715
01:19:06,444 --> 01:19:07,402
Vince, what are you doing?

716
01:19:07,403 --> 01:19:11,240
Quiet, they've been tracking you.

717
01:19:16,465 --> 01:19:18,465
I know she's here!

718
01:19:20,090 --> 01:19:22,090
Find her!

719
01:19:23,115 --> 01:19:25,115
Go! Go! Go!

720
01:19:37,141 --> 01:19:38,851
Its..Ok...wait.

721
01:19:39,060 --> 01:19:41,937
Reyes's guys were waiting for
me at the market.

722
01:19:41,938 --> 01:19:45,316
Vince saved my life.

723
01:19:48,653 --> 01:19:51,405
You hungry?

724
01:19:53,449 --> 01:19:54,249
Yeah, sure.

725
01:19:54,408 --> 01:19:56,911
Good!

726
01:19:57,245 --> 01:20:00,456
Cause you're saying grace.

727
01:20:01,082 --> 01:20:03,793
Thanks Vince.

728
01:20:09,118 --> 01:20:11,118
Yo you burned it!

729
01:20:12,443 --> 01:20:14,443
Relax!

730
01:20:14,468 --> 01:20:17,468
Yeah, but your mom is the worst cook
in the world.

731
01:20:21,686 --> 01:20:24,063
- C'mon baby we be livin.
- Cheers...cheers.....cheers.

732
01:20:24,564 --> 01:20:26,481
So we in Brazil.
The good life.

733
01:20:26,482 --> 01:20:28,191
Yeah.

734
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:31,277
So, you got a.....you got a little
more than 10-11 million dollars coming.

735
01:20:31,278 --> 01:20:33,195
Whats you gonna do with your money?

736
01:20:33,196 --> 01:20:33,996
Me?

737
01:20:34,114 --> 01:20:34,914
Yeah.

738
01:20:35,073 --> 01:20:36,991
Actually...man, I have been thinking
about opening up a garage back home.

739
01:20:36,992 --> 01:20:41,495
A place where people can bring their cars, and not
get completely ripped off, you know what I mean?

740
01:20:41,496 --> 01:20:42,414
Really?

741
01:20:42,455 --> 01:20:43,122
Yeah.

742
01:20:43,123 --> 01:20:46,376
So, your dream is to start a day job?

743
01:20:46,585 --> 01:20:48,502
That's...that's stupid...man, why would..

744
01:20:48,503 --> 01:20:49,461
Nah...that's not stupid at all..Man

745
01:20:49,462 --> 01:20:50,421
I love what I do.

746
01:20:50,422 --> 01:20:54,422
You wanna know what I'm
gonna do with my money.

747
01:20:56,178 --> 01:20:58,095
Find some cooking lesson for my man.

748
01:20:58,096 --> 01:21:04,726
- See, see? There you go with that negativity man.
- You know me .. money ain't a goddam thing.

749
01:21:04,853 --> 01:21:08,689
Its gonna take a little more than
money to learn how to cook...that's home.

750
01:21:08,690 --> 01:21:10,608
But, I heard they were looking for a chef.

751
01:21:10,609 --> 01:21:14,419
Down at this animal shelter.
Where you might....wanna.

752
01:21:14,444 --> 01:21:15,644
I know the manager .. I'll call him.

753
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:22,537
Hey Dom,

754
01:21:25,916 --> 01:21:29,544
Listen, I know you're all set for this
job tomorrow.

755
01:21:29,753 --> 01:21:31,553
If you need an extra men

756
01:21:31,671 --> 01:21:34,341
You're in.

757
01:21:41,264 --> 01:21:44,518
There's always room for family.

758
01:21:48,939 --> 01:21:51,233
Thank you!

759
01:21:53,735 --> 01:21:56,238
Get something to eat.

760
01:21:56,613 --> 01:21:58,698
Yeah.

761
01:22:00,423 --> 01:22:02,423
Can you believe Mia calls it the curse.

762
01:22:05,247 --> 01:22:08,375
She might be right.

763
01:22:11,962 --> 01:22:14,652
You really like doing that stuff, huh?

764
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:19,620
When your life is on the line,
that's when you learn about yourself.

765
01:22:23,473 --> 01:22:26,726
That's a fair deal.

766
01:22:28,270 --> 01:22:32,106
We're less than 24 hours from the biggest
celebration of our life.

767
01:22:32,107 --> 01:22:33,817
You gotta re-fill.

768
01:22:33,984 --> 01:22:35,901
This is some serious stuff.

769
01:22:35,902 --> 01:22:36,861
- No, I'm good.
- Cheers, baby.

770
01:22:36,862 --> 01:22:39,614
- I'm good .. no.
- No, she can't.

771
01:22:39,739 --> 01:22:40,698
What do you mean?

772
01:22:40,699 --> 01:22:42,450
She can't.

773
01:22:42,617 --> 01:22:46,617
What do you mean, she can't?

774
01:22:49,374 --> 01:22:52,043
Are you serious right now?

775
01:22:52,252 --> 01:22:55,688
Is that the reason you let him beat
you in the quarter mile?

776
01:22:56,789 --> 01:22:57,047
That was a baby gift.

777
01:22:57,048 --> 01:23:00,425
- That was a baby gift.
- No, that's messed up.

778
01:23:00,426 --> 01:23:02,085
No, you are not taking that from me.

779
01:23:02,086 --> 01:23:03,555
Wait, wait...hold on a second.

780
01:23:03,563 --> 01:23:04,722
Did he just smack that ass or,

781
01:23:04,723 --> 01:23:08,001
Did he grab that ass..

782
01:23:08,560 --> 01:23:11,605
- Just wanna know.
- Thanks .. Thank you ..

783
01:23:11,606 --> 01:23:13,606
It's crazy, huh

784
01:23:13,607 --> 01:23:17,177
Its your boy. Why would you keep
somethin like that away from me.

785
01:23:19,702 --> 01:23:21,910
Baby gift huh ?

786
01:23:22,011 --> 01:23:25,861
I have no idea what they're
talking about.

787
01:23:26,745 --> 01:23:29,080
Toast!

788
01:23:36,338 --> 01:23:40,338
Money will come and go, we know that.

789
01:23:41,134 --> 01:23:43,052
The most important thing in life.

790
01:23:43,053 --> 01:23:45,012
Will always be the people in this room.

791
01:23:45,013 --> 01:23:51,482
Right here, right now.

792
01:23:53,647 --> 01:23:56,942
Salute de familia...
salute...salute...

793
01:24:04,157 --> 01:24:06,827
I'm all set

794
01:24:07,035 --> 01:24:09,996
Santos, van good?

795
01:24:10,872 --> 01:24:13,333
Yeah, it's always good bro.

796
01:24:16,628 --> 01:24:19,478
Hobbs is on the other side of the city.

797
01:24:19,506 --> 01:24:21,423
We're not gonna get
a better window.

798
01:24:21,424 --> 01:24:24,094
Ok guys, its showtime.

799
01:24:24,302 --> 01:24:28,302
First team in position,
lets go. -Come on lets do this.

800
01:24:38,692 --> 01:24:43,253
Hey Dom, I got eyes on Mia.

801
01:24:48,454 --> 01:24:52,454
Moscow, Bali, Goa, Hong Kong.
What do they have all in common.

802
01:24:52,455 --> 01:24:54,554
No extradition.

803
01:24:55,955 --> 01:24:59,275
- We're one hour away from the rest of our lives.
- Yeah.

804
01:25:01,715 --> 01:25:04,301
Dom!

805
01:25:17,022 --> 01:25:19,733
You just made a big mistake.

806
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:22,776
Took me a while to find
that tracking chip.

807
01:25:22,777 --> 01:25:24,695
But, not as long to flip the receiver.

808
01:25:24,696 --> 01:25:25,654
You're going down Torretto.

809
01:25:25,655 --> 01:25:28,200
I'm right here.

810
01:26:51,032 --> 01:26:51,831
Dom!

811
01:26:51,991 --> 01:26:53,701
Stand back, I got this.

812
01:26:59,665 --> 01:27:02,293
Dom .. please Dom.

813
01:27:08,299 --> 01:27:10,718
Stop!

814
01:27:17,892 --> 01:27:20,186
Dom!

815
01:28:19,286 --> 01:28:20,996
Yeah?

816
01:28:21,205 --> 01:28:24,083
We're comin in now.

817
01:28:25,042 --> 01:28:28,552
Have the marshals meet us at the
airport when we land.

818
01:28:34,593 --> 01:28:37,012
Ambush!

819
01:28:52,820 --> 01:28:56,115
Wilkes, suppressing fire.
Set em down.

820
01:29:00,494 --> 01:29:03,205
Grab the back, cover me.

821
01:29:06,292 --> 01:29:09,044
Watch that.

822
01:29:18,721 --> 01:29:21,891
Cut us loose! Come on!
Cut us loose!

823
01:31:14,753 --> 01:31:18,507
You get em? Let's go!
Let's go!

824
01:31:56,003 --> 01:31:57,921
Hey Dom, you didn't meet my son

825
01:31:57,922 --> 01:32:00,132
Nico

826
01:32:03,677 --> 01:32:06,263
I will.

827
01:32:08,474 --> 01:32:11,352
He's a good kid.

828
01:32:13,270 --> 01:32:16,440
You know, we named him after you.

829
01:32:17,107 --> 01:32:19,527
Dominic.

830
01:32:25,741 --> 01:32:28,911
You've got my word Vince.

831
01:32:33,332 --> 01:32:37,127
You were always my brother.

832
01:32:44,885 --> 01:32:48,305
?? Nico now.

833
01:32:57,356 --> 01:32:59,274
We need to move, we don't
have that much time

834
01:32:59,275 --> 01:33:03,111
I got us a flight out that leaves Rio
in the rear view in next 5 hours.

835
01:33:03,112 --> 01:33:05,781
Not to run away ..

836
01:33:05,990 --> 01:33:07,700
To finish the job.

837
01:33:07,908 --> 01:33:11,537
Are you crazy Dom ? We can't.

838
01:33:11,745 --> 01:33:14,415
It's a suicide mission.

839
01:33:14,582 --> 01:33:17,457
That's your man over there
on the table.

840
01:33:17,458 --> 01:33:21,176
The plan is busted, this is bullshit man.

841
01:33:21,277 --> 01:33:23,147
Reyes knows we're coming.

842
01:33:23,196 --> 01:33:24,647
He's right.

843
01:33:24,714 --> 01:33:29,304
They tripled the detail at the police
station. Its gonna be a wall of gunfire.

844
01:33:29,971 --> 01:33:32,640
Reyes doesn't get away with this.

845
01:33:32,849 --> 01:33:35,810
Its a trap man, you know that.

846
01:33:36,686 --> 01:33:38,396
Dom! Listen to them.

847
01:33:38,605 --> 01:33:40,415
Run, before its too late.

848
01:33:40,523 --> 01:33:44,523
Leave Rio, you can be free

849
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:48,364
I don't need freedom.

850
01:33:49,157 --> 01:33:52,410
You should know that.

851
01:33:56,789 --> 01:34:00,335
You know you're all free
to make your own choices.

852
01:34:01,586 --> 01:34:04,172
I'm in.

853
01:34:11,179 --> 01:34:14,140
I'll ride with you Toretto.

854
01:34:15,975 --> 01:34:19,646
At least until we kill that
son of a bitch.

855
01:34:26,569 --> 01:34:29,239
So whats the plan Dom?

856
01:34:29,447 --> 01:34:32,247
Can't just go sneaking around
any more.

857
01:34:32,283 --> 01:34:34,994
We don't sneak.

858
01:34:35,161 --> 01:34:38,038
The only thing that he cares
about is his money.

859
01:34:38,039 --> 01:34:41,876
We pull that, we pull him.

860
01:34:58,601 --> 01:35:00,601
See

861
01:35:01,326 --> 01:35:04,326
I called in every cop on our payroll.

862
01:35:05,951 --> 01:35:07,951
We're covered.

863
01:35:08,176 --> 01:35:12,676
We've got every entrance covered with weapons teams.
God himself couldn't get at your money if he wanted to.

864
01:35:13,801 --> 01:35:15,801
God isn't my worry.

865
01:35:26,004 --> 01:35:28,965
You ready?

866
01:35:29,841 --> 01:35:32,635
I'm ready.

867
01:36:26,860 --> 01:36:28,560
What's happening?

868
01:36:28,585 --> 01:36:30,085
They're taking the vault.

869
01:36:30,110 --> 01:36:31,310
What ?

870
01:36:31,335 --> 01:36:32,835
The vault!

871
01:36:40,360 --> 01:36:41,860
Follow me! Quickly!

872
01:36:47,885 --> 01:36:49,385
Let me through!

873
01:36:58,610 --> 01:37:00,110
Don't move!

874
01:37:00,435 --> 01:37:01,935
Stay down!

875
01:37:30,670 --> 01:37:32,228
Call it out Mia!

876
01:37:32,329 --> 01:37:34,399
You got a straight shot for
two blocks.

877
01:37:34,507 --> 01:37:36,577
Go right.

878
01:37:36,585 --> 01:37:38,604
Got it.

879
01:37:57,530 --> 01:37:59,089
Well, the plans working.

880
01:37:59,090 --> 01:38:02,090
You guys have every cop car
in Rio on your tail.

881
01:38:02,615 --> 01:38:04,144
You guys have to move fast.

882
01:38:04,245 --> 01:38:05,621
Whats the best route?

883
01:38:05,622 --> 01:38:08,622
Keep going straight
another half mile at Rua Pasega.

884
01:38:09,123 --> 01:38:11,143
And then go left.

885
01:38:13,838 --> 01:38:16,508
That ain't gonna work.

886
01:38:16,716 --> 01:38:18,374
Spikes ahead Dom....we got spikes.

887
01:38:18,475 --> 01:38:20,637
We're going right.

888
01:38:21,513 --> 01:38:23,305
Nah .. its too tight ..
we're not gonna fit.

889
01:38:23,306 --> 01:38:25,725
We got no choice. Now!

890
01:38:43,535 --> 01:38:45,954
Sh...it!

891
01:38:51,355 --> 01:38:52,655
Holy....shit!

892
01:38:53,169 --> 01:38:57,599
Guys I am hearing all this chatter,
did you just take out a bank?

893
01:39:03,721 --> 01:39:06,391
Two inbound.

894
01:39:06,399 --> 01:39:07,958
Alright! There's an ally
coming up on your left.

895
01:39:07,959 --> 01:39:10,028
Yeah! I got it.

896
01:40:01,653 --> 01:40:03,653
You little bastard!

897
01:40:24,259 --> 01:40:27,429
Alright good job Dom. Right hander 
right here .. right hander.

898
01:40:32,351 --> 01:40:34,669
Guys, there's a big group
coming at you from south.

899
01:40:34,770 --> 01:40:38,148
You have to do something now!

900
01:40:39,608 --> 01:40:42,194
Hey go wide.

901
01:41:11,181 --> 01:41:13,433
Yeah!

902
01:42:09,181 --> 01:42:11,433
You're all clear on the left.

903
01:42:11,435 --> 01:42:14,434
Good afternoon officer.

904
01:42:14,435 --> 01:42:17,435
License and registration please.

905
01:42:23,436 --> 01:42:25,436
Yeah! This is big boy stuff.

906
01:42:25,437 --> 01:42:27,437
We clear on the right.

907
01:42:34,438 --> 01:42:38,138
- Thanks guys. 
- Anytime

908
01:42:38,139 --> 01:42:39,839
I'll see you on the other side.

909
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:44,100
You guys just cropped out a
10 second window, make it count.

910
01:42:50,325 --> 01:42:51,925
Zizi, stay on them.

911
01:43:17,750 --> 01:43:19,850
They can't outrun us on the bridge.

912
01:43:28,375 --> 01:43:30,575
Heh Heh .. They have no way out.

913
01:43:32,206 --> 01:43:34,724
No .. there's too many of them.

914
01:43:34,825 --> 01:43:37,703
Hey there's too many of them.
We are not gonna make it.

915
01:43:39,621 --> 01:43:41,361
You're right, we aren't.

916
01:43:41,540 --> 01:43:44,209
- You are.
- What are you talking about.

917
01:43:44,376 --> 01:43:46,711
Just let the vault go.
Get out of there.

918
01:43:46,712 --> 01:43:48,212
You're a father now, brian.

919
01:43:48,213 --> 01:43:51,090
I'm not leavin you. 
Now you stick with the plan.

920
01:43:51,091 --> 01:43:52,801
It was always the plan.

921
01:43:53,010 --> 01:43:54,720
Take care of Mia.

922
01:43:54,928 --> 01:43:58,888
Dom you listen to me.  Now, ok.
You cut loose right now!

923
01:44:13,913 --> 01:44:15,913
Hey, what is he doing ?

924
01:44:20,938 --> 01:44:22,938
We've got him!

925
01:44:37,363 --> 01:44:39,363
Close down the bridge!

926
01:45:11,588 --> 01:45:13,288
Do something, asshole!

927
01:45:23,613 --> 01:45:25,313
Kill him, dammit!

928
01:45:35,138 --> 01:45:37,038
Kill him now!

929
01:46:46,599 --> 01:46:50,269
I thought I told you to go on.

930
01:46:50,436 --> 01:46:53,481
Yeah! I had to make a call.

931
01:47:08,621 --> 01:47:11,123
Help me.

932
01:47:12,458 --> 01:47:16,212
That's for my team
you son of a bitch.

933
01:47:18,214 --> 01:47:19,924
Its a hell of a mess.

934
01:47:20,132 --> 01:47:22,593
Yeah, it is.

935
01:47:23,766 --> 01:47:28,724
You know I can't let you two go.
I ain't made that way.

936
01:47:29,725 --> 01:47:33,354
We'll see that you bring
yourself 24 hours.

937
01:47:33,563 --> 01:47:35,273
The money stays though.

938
01:47:35,481 --> 01:47:39,181
If I were you I'd use the time.

939
01:47:39,186 --> 01:47:42,646
Make peace with whatever
demons you got left.

940
01:47:45,352 --> 01:47:50,830
Cause come tomorrow ..
I will found you.

941
01:48:00,423 --> 01:48:02,133
Toretto

942
01:48:02,341 --> 01:48:05,511
I'll see ya soon.

943
01:48:06,179 --> 01:48:08,556
No you won't.

944
01:48:48,387 --> 01:48:49,267
Thanks guys.

945
01:48:49,347 --> 01:48:53,184
I'll see you on the other side.

946
01:48:55,062 --> 01:48:57,979
You guys just cropped out a
10 second window.

947
01:48:57,980 --> 01:49:01,150
Make it count.

948
01:49:41,107 --> 01:49:44,443
Come on baby, don't be mean.

949
01:50:56,468 --> 01:50:59,468
"For Rosa and Nico. See you soon.
Uncle Dom"

950
01:51:06,593 --> 01:51:08,593
MONACO

951
01:51:10,818 --> 01:51:12,818
You sure about this ?

952
01:51:14,543 --> 01:51:16,543
You know I am .

953
01:51:17,468 --> 01:51:19,468
You don't need to do this.

954
01:51:19,493 --> 01:51:21,493
Just leave me alone.

955
01:51:22,318 --> 01:51:24,318
Bro, I'm not trying to be negative,
but casinos ..

956
01:51:24,343 --> 01:51:26,743
.. are the kinds of places designed to take money
from guys like you and me.

957
01:51:26,768 --> 01:51:29,768
When I win here I'm buying you a lifetime 
supply of anti-depressants.

958
01:51:30,493 --> 01:51:32,593
You don't put ten million on red!

959
01:51:32,618 --> 01:51:35,618
- Enough already !
- You put it on black.

960
01:51:37,143 --> 01:51:39,543
No more bets, thank you.

961
01:52:02,999 --> 01:52:05,877
Right this way my dear.

962
01:52:06,636 --> 01:52:10,036
Stay right here.
I'll be right back.

963
01:52:10,673 --> 01:52:12,591
So, this is your dream..Huh.

964
01:52:12,592 --> 01:52:14,543
That's enough of me man.

965
01:52:14,552 --> 01:52:17,221
I take it that's your dream.

966
01:52:17,230 --> 01:52:19,288
- Absolutely...what up .. boy.
- Whats going on?

967
01:52:19,289 --> 01:52:21,306
- You good. 
- Yes, yes.

968
01:52:21,307 --> 01:52:22,976
You know what's crazy?

969
01:52:23,003 --> 01:52:25,061
There's only four of those cars
in the whole world.

970
01:52:25,062 --> 01:52:27,939
And I got the only one 
in the western hemisphere.

971
01:52:27,940 --> 01:52:32,479
I made a sheikh in Abu Dhabi
an offer he could not refuse.

972
01:52:32,736 --> 01:52:36,572
- Huh .. that's a nice lady you got there too. 
- Oh absolutely.

973
01:52:39,573 --> 01:52:41,363
So we got to go man. Lets do this.

974
01:52:41,451 --> 01:52:43,161
Ok, I'll drive.

975
01:52:43,369 --> 01:52:45,539
In that? Come on man .. no .. no way.

976
01:52:45,647 --> 01:52:51,209
No .. no .. not in this .. in that!

977
01:52:55,881 --> 01:52:58,383
Are you serious right now.

978
01:52:58,459 --> 01:52:59,717
Man this is crazy.

979
01:52:59,718 --> 01:53:00,470
Yeah.

980
01:53:00,637 --> 01:53:05,137
I guess that means there are two
in the western hemisphere..Huh...huh.

981
01:53:05,310 --> 01:53:07,310
Whats your smart ass gotta say now?

982
01:53:07,511 --> 01:53:11,229
Well you know what,
we can always shine together baby.

983
01:53:11,230 --> 01:53:13,567
Get dressed man,
we got things to do.

984
01:53:24,660 --> 01:53:27,296
So where to now?

985
01:53:27,497 --> 01:53:28,207
I don't know.

986
01:53:28,415 --> 01:53:31,085
Never been to Madrid.

987
01:53:31,293 --> 01:53:34,211
I thought you wanted to go to Tokyo.

988
01:53:34,212 --> 01:53:36,756
We'll get there.

989
01:53:37,094 --> 01:53:40,597
Eventually.

990
01:54:52,036 --> 01:54:56,913
This is the happiest I've
ever seen my sister.

991
01:54:56,914 --> 01:54:59,875
It's cause were free.

992
01:55:12,262 --> 01:55:17,724
You know, I wanna another shot.

993
01:55:18,018 --> 01:55:21,228
Yeah?

994
01:55:21,237 --> 01:55:23,147
Yeah.

995
01:55:23,155 --> 01:55:28,045
No wagers, nobody else,
just you and me once and for all.

996
01:55:34,367 --> 01:55:37,184
You sure you can handle
the disappointment?

997
01:55:37,285 --> 01:55:39,871
Are you?

998
01:55:40,422 --> 01:55:42,833
Alright, O'Conner.

999
01:55:42,841 --> 01:55:46,294
Lets see what you got.

1000
01:55:54,819 --> 01:55:57,819
Diplomatic Security Service Headquarters,
Washington, D.C.

1001
01:56:11,295 --> 01:56:15,295
You need to look at that.

1002
01:56:17,296 --> 01:56:20,296
Berlin, 3 am this morning.

1003
01:56:20,297 --> 01:56:22,497
A team of hikers,
hijacked a military convey.

1004
01:56:22,598 --> 01:56:25,298
- Torreto? 
- Nope!

1005
01:56:25,399 --> 01:56:27,198
Ain't interested.

1006
01:56:27,299 --> 01:56:31,299
Yes you are, keep looking.

1007
01:56:41,300 --> 01:56:44,880
You believe in ghosts?
