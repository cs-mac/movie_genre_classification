I love love
I love being in love

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,280
I don't care
what it does to me

00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:16,480
Sing I love love

I don't care

8
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,880
These pills are fine
to pass the time 'til I find my new drug

9
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:47,920
We'll take our chances
we'll last a month

10
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,760
We'll never speak again
How I love being in love

11
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,240
May I help you?

12
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,600
Huh? No.

13
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,600
Thank you. Thank you very much.
I'm just browsing.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,640
- Thank you.
- So let me guess.

15
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,920
Big night tonight?

16
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,000
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

17
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,240
Yeah, actually. Actually, the biggest.

18
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,880
- Really?
- Yeah.

19
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,360
- Menage a trois?
- Pardon me?

20
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,800
I'm kidding.

21
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,800
Oh, a menage a trois.

So you're looking
for something for your girl?

24
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,480
Well, not just any girl, okay?

25
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,640
The most...
The most beautiful and incredible

26
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,480
and amazing and...

27
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,640
Well, girl I've ever met.

28
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,760
Okay. Well, if you have any questions,
my name is Claire.

29
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,800
Okay. Actually, yeah.
Does this come in red?

30
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,000
- I can check.
- Also, Claire, does it come any larger?

31
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,240
Much, much larger.

32
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,880
Oh, no.

33
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,160
Hey. Is she in there?

34
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,880
- Yeah, she's in there.
- Good.

35
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,520
How do I look?

36
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,680
I see your balls.

37
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,160
Are you crazy?
Come here. Come here. Up here, up.

38
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,200
- What's the matter with you?
- What?

39
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,600
This? This is the big idea?

40
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,800
Yeah. Yeah. She's gonna love it.

41
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,040
- She's gonna hate it.
- She's gonna love it.

42
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,200
- No, she's gonna hate it.
- Love it.

43
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,600
No, she's gonna hate it more than I hate it,
and I really hate it.

44
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,920
You know what your problem is, Ted?
You just...

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,920
You don't understand true love.

46
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,160
Oh, and you do?

47
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,840
I understand that there's a girl
that I love waiting for me in there.

48
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,920
And you know what? She loves me, too.

49
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,960
I still see balls.

50
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,680
Can I get you a drink
while you wait for your friend?

51
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,720
Hopefully, in a man's life,
you do this one time.

52
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,760
Well, I want my one time
to be unforgettable.

53
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,280
I want tonight to be a story Vanessa
and me will be telling our grandkids.

54
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,600
You almost done with that baby oil?

55
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,280
Yeah. That's it.

56
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,320
Get it in there. Soak those abs.

57
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,320
- I'm gonna kill you.
- (SIGHING) Thanks, buddy.

58
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,840
- What's up, ladies?
- Oh, goodness.

59
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,600
There you go, beautiful.
I brought you some c-rations on the house.

60
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,080
Some what?

61
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,040
Oh, sorry. That's Special Forces talk.

62
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,000
Are you in the Special Forces?

63

My job is to close a deal.

66
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,000
- Trust me. This is not gonna close a deal.
- Give me the ring, Ted.

67
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,840
No. I can't let you do this.

68
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,440
- Give me the ring!
- No.

- No.

Just give me the ring! I just want the ring!
I've got to propose!

I'm not gonna lie to you, Vanessa.

74
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,080
Special Ops,

75
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,280
it's a deadly game.

76
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,640
But as a very brave person once remarked,

77
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,720
"Life is either daring or it's nothing."

78

Do you know who that brave person was?

79
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,240
My personal hero, Helen Keller.

80
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:41,080
Helen Keller.

81
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,160
Excuse me, Vanessa.
I think table 16 needs more garlic knots.

82
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,480
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please?

like gumdrops or whatever,

162
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,440
but I know you won't unless you try.

163
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:27,000
So is that it? Is that it, huh?
You want me to try?

164
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,640
One time. That's all I'm saying.

165
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,440
- One time. I try, you get off my back.
- You have my solemn word.

166
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,600
Fine.

167
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,040
Fine, Ted. I'll try. I'll try.

168
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,000
Hey. Can I get you guys anything else?

169
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,240
(SINGING SOFTLY)
That's what I'm talking about.

170
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,600
Back on the horse.

171
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:47,360
Is there anything else I can get for you?

172
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,880
Will you marry me?

173
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,760
Excuse me?

174
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,960
Will you marry me?

175
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,160
LOIS: Stuart, you're flapping...
All right. Pigs? Three little pigs?

176
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,240
A banjo? And piggies?

177
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,640
Deliverance!

178
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,760
- Oh, my gosh! Like a machine.
- Oh, man.

179
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,800
- Oh, my God. Oh, you guys are so fast.
- That was great.

180
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,760
Okay. It's my turn,
and this is a really good one.

181
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,240
So I need you all to pay attention.
Especially you, mon amour.

182
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,080
(FRENCH ACCENT) Give me the little hand.

183
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,200
- Isn't he the cutest thing ever?
- Hey, I resent that.

184
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,560
Isn't it getting kind of late, you guys?

185
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,680
Oh, what's the matter, Cinderella?

186
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,680
You're not gonna turn into a pumpkin,
are you?

187
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,080
Do I know how to push her buttons,
or what?

188
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,000
I am pushing your buttons.

189
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:42,120
Honey, do your charade, okay?
I have to get up early tomorrow.

190
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,560
Aye, aye, Captain. Okay.

191
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,480
Oh, wait. We can't do this...

192
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,120
Incoming.

193
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,720
Here we go. Last one.

194
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,480
(INHALING DEEPLY)

195
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,720
- Four words. First word.
- Four words. First word.

196
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,800
- Me... Me...
- Shazam.

197
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,880
William! William! Shorter. Willie. Will!

198
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,320
- Will.
- Will. Okay.

199
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,360
- Second word. It sounds like...
- Second word. Sounds like...

200
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,480
- Rockette. Boot. Shoe.
- Shoe.

201
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,760
You.

202
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,400
(BLOWING)

203
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,600
Fourth word.

204
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,320
- Me, it's me again... Me?
- Me?

205
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,680
- Oh, it is "Me." Okay.
- Will you blank me?

206
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,440
Hey, buddy, there's ladies present.

207
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,120
All right, well, you know,
that's just tasteless, Stuart,

208
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,160
- for God's sake.
- Sorry.

209
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,200
All right. Will you blank me?

210
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,600
Third word.

211
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,400
Saunter.

212
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,040
- Marry?
- Stuart, he's proposing.

213
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,760
Katie, will you marry me?

214
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,360
Yes! Yes! She says yes!

215
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,800
- Honey?
- Katie!

216
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:43,800
Katie!

217
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,720
Katie!

218
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,480
Honestly, Katherine,

219
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,400
do you have any idea how embarrassing
that was for me last night?

220
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,840
I didn't say no, Mom.
I just said I needed to think about it.

221
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,280
What's there to think about?

222
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,600
That boy is a catch, and he's crazy
about you. God knows why.

223
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,520
Just tell me, what is it you want?
Because William is perfect.

224
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,920
For one thing, he's just about
the most attractive orthodontist

225
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,960
I think I've ever seen.

226
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,280
And he's incredibly romantic.

227
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,000
Mom, I know he's perfect.
I just need a little time.

228
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,720
Will you talk to her, Stuart?

229
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,360
Not to toot my own horn,

230
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,640
but William reminds me a lot of me
when I was younger.

231
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,200
Are you listening to your father?

232
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,360
He is not my father.

233
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,880
This man is more of a father to you
than your father ever was,

234
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,960
God rest his soul.

235
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,000
- Dad is not dead.
- He's dead to me, the son of a bitch.

236
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,200
- Don't talk about Dad that way!
- Don't you raise your voice to me!

237
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,840
- You're getting emotional, Lois.
- I am not getting emotional!

238
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,960
All right.
I am leaving this house in five minutes,

239
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,760
and if you want to be on that bus,
I suggest you pull yourself together.

240
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,200
Sometimes I wonder if you still love him.

241
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,280
Who?

242
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,040
- Dad.
- Are you crazy? Are you out of your mind?

243
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,000
Well, you must have loved him once.

244
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,440
Honey, I was 18 when I met your father
and about as dumb as a piece of ham.

245
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,080
What did I know about love?
All I knew was...

246
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,360
He was the hottest thing
that I had ever seen.

247
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,240
Oh, he looked like a panther,

248
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,240
a sex panther.

249
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,040
Sounds like love to me.

250
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,800
Well, there's a big difference between love
and mindless, animalistic, carnal lust.

251
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,680
And what do you have with Stuart?

252
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,520
What I have with Stuart is what I want
for you and William.

253
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,080
- A mature, stable relationship.
- But are you happy?

254
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,160
Of course I'm happy. I'm very happy.

255
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,960
Very, very happy.

256
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,840
No, no. Very happy.

257
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:37,880
Very happy.

258
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,560
- I gotta go. The bus is here.
- All right.

259
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,520
Very happy.

260
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,720
There she is. There's my beautiful girl!

261
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,280
Hey! Keep it down.

262
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,680
I will eat your head!
I will tear it off, shove it up your ass,

263
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:20,000
pull it through your mouth,
brush my teeth with it, and then eat it!

264
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,720
- I will eat it.
- Smitty!

265
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,800
I'm not finished. Eat it!

266
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,080
- Dad.
- What?

267
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,120
- Apologize to him.
- Oh, come on.

268
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,800
I'm serious, Dad. It's just rude. Now.

269
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,440
Do it now, Dad.

270
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,360
Hey, Dave. I'm sorry.

271
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,760
Smitty, I'm working
on my appeal over here.

272
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,000
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

273
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,160
You see, that's why
I love you so much, Baby Bear.

274
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,600
You got your mother's good heart.

275
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,200
What's wrong?

276
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,280
No, nothing.
William asked me to marry him.

277
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,520
But that's good.
That's what you wanted, no?

278
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,760
Yeah.

279
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,880
No.

280
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,240
Oh, Dad, I don't know. I just...

281
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,680
I mean, how are you supposed to know
when you're with the right person?

282
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,920
Just listen to your heart, Baby Bear.

283
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,480
You'll know.

284
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,920
Hey, do you know what I do
when I'm feeling blue?

285
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,560
Yeah. You drink homemade toilet wine.

286
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,800
No!

287
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,880
Well, yeah.
But I also write in my gratitude journal.

288
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,680
And every day, I write about the things
that I have to be grateful for,

289
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,200
like you and your mother.

290
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,840
Oh, here.

291
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,800
"December 25th, Christmas Day.

292
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,440
"I am grateful that somebody finally
stabbed that cocksucker Rodriguez."

293
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,840
Dad.

294
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,440
I'm gonna say yes.

295
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,520
Yes!

296
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,120
I mean, we get along so well, right?

297
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,080
He's so funny. He cracks me up, you guys.

298
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,240
I'm gonna say yes.

299
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,800
That's great. Right, Matador?

300
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,760
I think William is kind of a turd.

301
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,840
- Really?
- Yeah.

302
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,520
But he's like a turd
with a piece of candy in it.

303
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,960
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

304
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,680
Marriage isn't in our blood.
We're circus folk.

305
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,800
Gypsies roaming from big top to big top
on the open road.

306
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,160
You guys have been working in the diner
since I've known you.

307
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,240
Not in here, Katie. Not in here.

308
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,760
Gentlemen, observe.

309
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:00,800
(SCREAMING)

310
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,240
Can I get you guys anything else?

311
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,800
Will you marry me?

312
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,640
- Excuse me?
- Will you marry me?

313
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,760
Seriously.

314
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,520
Think about it.
What could possibly be more romantic

315
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,480
than throwing away your entire life
and running off with some handsome,

316
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,800
dark-haired stranger
you spotted across a restaurant?

317
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,440
I'm sorry. He's had a lot of syrup.

318
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:31,200
- Okay.
- Okay, he's had a lot of syrup?

319
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,680
Okay, I'll marry you.

320
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,880
What?

321
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,800
Yes. Yes.

322
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,440
I'll marry you!

323
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,760
Jane! Jane! Will you cover for me?

324
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,840
Where're you going?

325
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,960
(SCREAMING)

326
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,240
I'm getting married! To this guy!

327
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,040
Come on. Come on!

328
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,600
Go. Get out of here. I got the bill.

329
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,400
Oh!

330
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,440
Anderson.

331
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,520
- Katie.
- Katie. Hi.

332
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,960
Two kisses.

333
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,760
Big rig. Watch this.

334
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,200
Stick that arm up your ass!

335
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:44,120
Got a brand new roof
above my head

336
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,960
All the empty boxes
thrown away

337
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,600
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah. Yeah.

338
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,520
So years from now,
when we're celebrating

339
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,920
our 37th wedding anniversary

340
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,120
and one of our friends
asks us about our first date,

341
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,320
is this what we'll talk about?

342
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,520
I guess it is. Yeah. Okay.

343
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,680
And... And then I'll tell them
the funny part.

344
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,000
What's the funny part?

345
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,120
That after we talked about it,
you stepped in dog shit.

346
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,320
- Oh! I stepped in dog shit!
- Yeah.

347
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,080
Why didn't you warn me?
You could have warned me.

348
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,080
That would have ruined the story.

349
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,680
Ah, man. Can I borrow your...

350
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,040
Oh, God! Cut it out!

351
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,520
ANDERSON: Okay, careful, careful.

352
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,240
I've never been up here before.

353
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:47,520
Yeah, it's a cool place to come if you want
to get an old refrigerator filled with vomit.

354
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,480
I was looking for one of those.

355
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,160
Yeah? Well, I think
it's two-for-one day, so...

356
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,520
Look what I've got.

357
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,640
Tetanus?

358
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,800
(SIGHS)

359
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,720
- This is stupid.
- What?

360
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,000
You know, this. Us sitting up here,
pretending we're doing something.

361
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,040
It's just stupid.

362
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,560
It is, right?

363
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,480
I mean, obviously
we're not getting married.

364
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,720
Obviously.

365
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,880
- Strangers don't get married.
- Well, in some cultures they do.

366
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,160
- They do?
- But not ours.

367
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,640
Not ours.
Other cultures, far-away cultures.

368
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,480
The Kalahari bushmen is one example.

369
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,880
- And my parents did. They did.
- They did?

370
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,320
My mom barely knew my dad,

371
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,920
and she got pregnant with me,
and they eloped

372
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,720
to this weird little place
called The House of Wedded Bliss

373
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,760
in Atlantic City.

374
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,000
The House of Wedded Bliss?

375
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,600
Yeah.

376
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,320
Doesn't that sound incredibly romantic?

377
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,880
Sounds like a bad Chinese takeout place.

378
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:53,000
Yeah, well, I mean, just because they did,
doesn't mean that we are, right?

379
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,680
You probably weren't even serious
when you asked.

380
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,040
Were you?

381
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,600
Of course not.

382
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,720
You see, that's what I'm talking about.
I mean, this whole thing is just...

383
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:08,760
It's stupid.

384
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,600
- Wait.
- I'm sorry.

385
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,080
Wait, wait, wait. What's happening?

386
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,720
I'm just such an idiot.

387
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,440
Are you crying?

388
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,400
- No.
- Why are you crying?

389
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,400
I am not crying.

390
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,680
It really looks like you're crying.

391
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,520
Yeah, well, I'm crying now.

392
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,760
Are you satisfied, you asshole?

393
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,400
Hey. Hey, hey.

394
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,960
Hey. Hey, you.

395
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,480
Hey! Hey.

396
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,520
Are you okay?

397
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:53,760
I can't remember the last time I did that.
I don't think I've ever done that.

398
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:58,000
- Do you want a tissue?
- No, I'm fine. I feel incredible.

399
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,200
Really?

400
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,440
Why is that?

401
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,440
- You sure you don't want a tissue?
- No, I'm fine.

402
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,960
Anderson, when you asked me
to marry you,

403
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,480
you probably picked the only girl
in the whole world that would say yes.

404
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,280
I don't think that's a coincidence, do you?

405
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,400
I don't know.

406
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,880
- Do you believe in fate?
- No.

407
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,440
Neither do I.
You see, this was meant to be.

408
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,160
Will you marry me?

409
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,920
- TED: You said yes?
- Yeah. Well, why not?

410
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,160
You know, I think this is exactly
what I need to get my life back on track.

411
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,000
I mean,
why can't two strangers get married?

412
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,640
- I don't know. Because it's retarded?
- Look, you said it yourself.

413
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,920
You said I need to get back out there
and meet people. Right? So...

414
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,800
Yeah, meet! Meet! Not marry!

415
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,600
Why can't you just date her for a while
like a normal human being?

416
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,520
Look, don't worry. Okay? It's not...

417
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,640
You know, it's not like
we're getting married today.

418
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,240
We talked about it,
and we decided to take things slow.

419
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,480
- So what's next?
- She's moving in with me.

420
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,480
I gotta go.

421
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,560
Okay. Well, good luck with that.

422
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,760
I don't care
whether you hear this

423
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,120
I don't care if I'm alone
here singing songs to myself

424
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:22,040
There's nobody else around,
around

425
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,720
Meet you up
at the Indian part of the town

426
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,560
The town's shut down,
the people left with their bags

427
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,560
Their kids so there's not
a sound, a sound

428
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,040
But I must get
from there to here

429
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:42,480
There's a small voice crying
on the other side of the river from here

430
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,760
It's too late
to phone her now

431
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,600
William, I have some weird news.
It's good news for me.

432
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,720
I can't marry you.
I'll explain everything later. I'm so sorry.

433
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,880
I love you... As a friend. Okay, bye.

434
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,560
Just a minute
close your eyes

435
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,160
If we settle
for this compromise I'll stay with you

436
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,560
The river looks
so good tonight

437
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:12,080
Can I leave a message for 99138?

438
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,960
I don't know
what's with your friend

439
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,040
Phone message, Smitty.

440
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:22,560
She said she'd had enough
of playing games

441
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,280
It's from my daughter.
She's getting married.

442
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,440
Oh, yeah?

443
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,640
It's too bad you're not gonna be there

444
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,880
to walk her down the aisle, big guy.

445
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,160
(SHOUTING)

446
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,480
- What is this?
- I'm getting married!

447
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,960
- No, this.
- It's a diaphragm.

448
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,200
I know what it is. Not in front of...
Please. Please.

449
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,760
- It's her diaphragm.
- Stuart!

450
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,360
- Damn it!
- Jeez.

451
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,600
- Where are you going?
- I told you. I'm getting married.

452
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,440
(WHOOPING)

453
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,080
- You said yes!
- Not to William.

454
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,600
Not to William?

455
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,800
His name's Anderson.
I met him a couple of hours ago.

456
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,440
A couple of hours ago?

457
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,280
What kind of... What about William?
What kind of name is Anderson?

458
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,800
- Use your head here, Katie.
- He's black, isn't he?

459
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,440
I have to go.

460
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,120
Don't you think
you're being a little impulsive?

461
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,800
Yes! That is exactly what I'm being.
And guess what? It feels great!

462
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,240
- You ready?
- Oh, my God.

463
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,240
Hi.

464
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,240
Hey, there, dude. You must be Anderson.

465
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,280
- No.
- Matador.

466
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,440
This is my friend, Matador.
He's just giving me a ride.

467
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,200
I like your Jew hat.

468
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:46,760
Bye, Mom. I'll bring him by
for you to meet him tomorrow!

469
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,280
(COUGHING)

470
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,400
- Can you see?
- No.

471
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,200
No problem.
You know, this happens all the time.

472
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:51,960
How can you see?

473
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:55,200
Just be patient!

- Can do.
- Thank you. Thank you.

but I'll be fine.

- My clothes.

- Your clothes?
- Yeah, you know, for wearing.

Right. I thought you said "cloves." Cloves.

"Cloves, that's a weird thing to pack."

So, yup. So this... This is the bedroom.
This is the bedroom.

546
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,680
So listen, I was thinking about everything
and how great this is,

547
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,840
but it's all happening so fast,
and I was afraid

548
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,080
that maybe you thought it
was happening too fast.

00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,680

That's what I was exactly going to say.

I couldn't be more thrilled.

Really? No, no, no. I don't...
That's weird. I don't get nervous.

- Who's Vanessa?
- Who?

556
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,400
You said "Vanessa"
right before you passed out.

557
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,880
- I did?
- Oh, is this her?

558
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,240
No. No, that's not her.
I don't know who that is.

00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,640
Yeah, there I am, right there. I know.

562
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,160
That's because I used to do
some modeling when I was younger.

563
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,720
- Really?
- Yes, I did.

back when that whole "regular guy" phase

566

was sweeping the picture frame
modeling industry.

- Yeah.

00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,200
- It's in my eye! It hurts!
- I'm sorry. I swallowed some. Sorry.

636
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,200
It's really burning.

637
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,920
Did you wanna go in...
The bathroom's right there.

638
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,360
- Where?
- Yup, this way. Yes. Yeah, you got it.

639
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,360
Maybe I should go out
and get some saline solution.

640
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,720
No. I'm fine.

641
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,160
Yeah, but maybe I should go, you know,

642
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,520
get some saline
or eye drops or something.

643
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,920
No, really.

644
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,680
I'll go get some saline.

645
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:06,760
- Okay. Okay. Okay.
- Okay. Slow down. What's the problem?

646
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,080
I think she wants to have sex with me.

647
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,240
I'm gonna call 911.

648
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,560
I'm so embarrassed.
I mean, I feel like such an idiot.

649
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,960
- Maybe you just came on a little strong.
- Oh, God.

650
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,320
A couple hours ago, she was moving in.

651
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,680
All your problems were solved,

652
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,720
rainbows were shooting out of your ass.
What happened?

653
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,880
Nothing. Nothing. She's great. She's great.
It's just...

654
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:27,960
What?

655
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,240
- What would Vanessa say? Huh?
- Oh, buddy.

656
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,960
I was just trying to be spontaneous,
you know?

657
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,800
He probably thinks I'm such a freak.

658
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,640
No. Trust me. You're not a freak.

659
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,520
Hold on. Help. Help. Help me.

660
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,560
I've got to go. He's here.

661
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,280
- Hi.
- Hi. Hi.

662
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,400
They were out of saline,
so I got you some Q-tips

663
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,520
and some zit cream.

664
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,360
So you can do with that what you please.

665
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,040
How's your head?

666
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,880
- Oh, sorry.
- No, it's okay.

667
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,720
My eye is fine.

668
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,680
Right. How's your eye?

669
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,320
- It's fine.
- Good.

670
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,000
Wow.

671
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,560
- Wowee.
- Wowee dowee doo.

672
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,600
Doowee wowie booby.

673
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:55,080
Well, I think we better get to bed.
I think it's time for...

674
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,240
Not... I mean, not that kind of bed.
Not that kind of bed.

675
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,960
I mean... I mean, like,
sleepy time. Sleepy bed.

676
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,520

'Cause I... You know.
'Cause your eye and my head and...

any more physical contact,

00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,720

came and went

00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,440
- I'm sorry. Sorry.
- It's all right.

683
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,600
- Go back to sleep. I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

Sunday afternoon's

685
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,240
She was just lying there

00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,160

Oh, sorry.

Okay. You know what?
You know what, dear?

705
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,160
We give up. Why don't you just tell us?

706
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,280
- That was The Apple Dumpling Gang.
- Oh.

707
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,360
It's not an easy one. So...

708
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:06,720
It was really good.

709
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,120
Thanks. Thanks. Thank you.
I'm sorry... Thanks.

710
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,400
- You're so good. Yeah. It was hard.
- I thought it...

711
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,880
- I thought it made sense.
- It was good.

712
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,640
- It was a tough one, so...
- Yeah.

713
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:21,280
And then a few years ago,
I was in a toy store and I had a thought.

714
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:26,720
What if there was a line of stuffed animals
specifically for Jewish children?

715
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,080
And that's when the Jewnicorn was born.

719
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,240
Wow.

00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,920
Wow.

I think it's very...

Specific.

723
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,080
In a good way, of course.

So, Anderson, what is it you do?

Oh, Anderson's
between jobs right now, Mom.

- Oh, he's between jobs?
- Yeah.

I see.

728
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:18,120
You know, maybe you'd like
to go downstairs to the basement

Especially if you like googly eyes.

- I'm not pregnant.

This is my stop.
Getting off, getting off, getting off!

- My fiancee.

Fiancee?

She's a peach.

Yeah. I guess you think
I'm being pretty foolish, huh?

818
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,480
Why should I think that?

819
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,920
Because I just met Katie,
and we hardly know each other.

820

You've got your whole lives
to get to know each other.

- Oh, that's just nerves talking.

822
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:43,720
I remember just before I got married,
your grandpa and I walked our dog,

823
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:47,120
had a little conversation
about the birds and the bees.

I tell you,

I just about fell down.

about that stuff, Dad.

Oh, of course you do. Of course you do.
You're a grown man.

About time
that I started treating you like one.

830

So I guess I don't have to tell you
what this is for.

831

Oh, no, I won't have any of that.
We're family now.

I'd like you to call me Mommy.

Okay.

857
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,080
I suppose Anderson told you
all about Vanessa?

00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,520
Oh. No. Yeah. I mean, he did.

Mommy.

He really loved her. I suppose we all did.

Why did they break up?

Oh, heavens, they didn't break up.

When she went,
it just about tore this family apart.

sticking Daddy's service revolver

in my mouth and pulling the trigger,
just so I could be with her in heaven.

to take Vanessa's...

- Who's Vanessa?
- She was my girlfriend.

- Okay, technically, she never said yes.

That's not what your mother says.

Okay? Okay? But...

But what?
I mean, you're still in love with her?

accepts a marriage proposal

906
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,680
from a complete stranger? Freak!

Well, what kind of a person asks? Freak!

908
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:32,360
- Stop calling me freak!
- Stop being one, you freak!

909
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:35,280
Okay. Okay.
I don't care what you think about me,

910
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:36,560
just leave her out of it.

It's Vanessa, you asshole!

love made a fool of me

but now you're here to see

It comes as no surprise

918
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:37,920
Just leave the light on

00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:54,120
You know, when I was a kid,
I didn't have many friends.

929
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,600
You're kidding?

930
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:59,040
Nope. It's the truth. I don't know why.

931
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:03,160
Perhaps 'cause I was into
different things than the other kids.

932
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:06,400
Acrobats, strongmen, makeup,
that sort of thing.

933
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,440
Right. That sort of thing.

934
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,800
But I didn't let it bother me, you know,
because I knew what I loved.

The circus?

936
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,520
You know, the circus is a lot like love.

00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:23,920
Oh? How so?

938
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,840
Well, if it's a good one,
it's a really good one, it's beautiful

939
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:34,120
and terrifying and magical,
all at the same time.

940
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:39,400
And you wouldn't give up on the circus
just because

941
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:43,320
once in a while a girl falls off
the high wire, snaps her neck.

942

Oh, dead girls.

943
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:52,040
Sensitive subject. I'm sorry.

944
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:00,280

you could open it for me.

01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:34,360
and on behalf of my family,

1268
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:38,320
I'd like to welcome you all
to The House of Wedded Bliss.

1269
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:43,880
A couple who marries here,
I personally guarantee,

1270
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:47,800
that's a marriage that's gonna last for life.

1271
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:51,880
And we never forget a face.
Ain't that right, Lois and Smitty?

1272
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:54,040
Big Bear.

1273
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,480
Now, on to the business at hand.

1274
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:02,920
Anderson, do you take this woman
to be your wife?

1275
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:14,320
Do you?

1276
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:16,800
Anderson?

1277
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:25,120
Sorry. I don't.

1278
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:28,440
Vanessa, when I met you,
I thought you were perfect.

1279
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:31,480
And you are. I mean... I mean, look at you.

1280
01:17:33,960 --> 01:17:38,640
But then I met Katie,
and she's perfect for me.

1281
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:45,000
I'm sorry. Are you... You're heartbroken.

1282
01:17:45,240 --> 01:17:48,160
Anderson, I want you to meet somebody.

1283
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:50,200
You remember Morty, right?

1284
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:52,160
"Shooter, shooter. We got a shooter."

1285
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:55,680
He killed himself after I died.
Isn't that so romantic?

1286
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:58,640
I couldn't live without her, dude.

1287
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:02,080
I know, we just met. But she's the one.

1288
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:03,360
Know what I mean?

1289
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:05,920
Yeah, I think I do.

1290
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:08,640
Listen, babe, we gotta blow.
I'll be in the Humvee.

1291
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:13,800
Bye.

1292
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:23,720
Do you want to get back
to your wedding now, son?

1293
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:30,360
I do.

1294
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:37,120
Son, you've got to wait
until you say "I do."

1295
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:40,440
Son?

(SIGHS)

1297
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:46,640
I do. I do. I do.

1298
01:18:46,720 --> 01:18:49,880
You got a ring? Because if you don't,
we have some splendid ones

1299
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:51,640
in the gift shop for $19.95.

1300
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:53,720
No. No, no, no. I have a ring.

1301
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,720
I have another ring.

1302
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:05,400
Remember this?

1303
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:24,280
By the power vested in me,
I pronounce you husband and wife.

1304
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:29,760
Everybody's gonna love today

1305
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:31,720
Gonna love today
gonna love today

1306
01:19:31,800 --> 01:19:33,520
Everybody's gonna love today

1307
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:34,920
Gonna love today

1308
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,280
Anyway you want to

1309
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:37,760
Anyway you've got to

1310
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:39,880
Love, love me

1311
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:41,600
Love, love me

1312
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:43,400
Love, love me

1313
01:19:43,480 --> 01:19:44,760
Love, love me

1314

(SIREN SOUNDS)

1315
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,200
SHERIFF: All right, freeze!

1316
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:48,240
I LoJacked your ass.

1317
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,080
That's him right there!
Arrest him! Arrest him!

1318
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:52,160
- Arrest him!
- All right. Hey!

1319
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:54,040
That is my ear, my friend.

1320
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,080
Sorry.

1321
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:57,400
How would you like it if I did that to you?

1322
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:00,520
- I said I'm sorry.
- All righty.

1323
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:03,320
On a personal note,

1324
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:06,120
I understand we have
some newlyweds here.

1325
01:20:06,240 --> 01:20:07,720
Yes. Yes, sir. That's...

1326
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:14,320
I'd like to offer the congratulations
of myself and the whole team.

1327
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:15,480
- Thank you very much. Thank you.
- That's nice.

1328
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:16,880
- It is.
- That's cool.

1329
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:24,160
We didn't know
where you were registered.

1330
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:25,240
Oh, wow.

1331
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:28,320
It's a blender.
I had some help picking it out.

1332
01:20:29,760 --> 01:20:30,960
William?

1333
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:33,800
I realized something today, Katie.

1334
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:36,680
No matter how hard you try
to plan your life,

1335
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:40,560
life has a plan for you all its own.

1336
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:42,440
Good luck.

1337
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:45,200
- Thank you, guys.
- Guys, thank you.

1338
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:47,200
Why is he hugging the cop?

1339
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:49,080
Okay, guys, now.

1340
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:51,840
- Very nice.
- No, seriously, why is he hugging the cop?

1341
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,000
All right.

1342
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:58,920
On a professional note,
y'all are under arrest.

1343
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:01,080
Right. Just...

1344
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:04,280
Considering we might not all be
together again for quite some time,

1345
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:07,680
Katie and I were hoping to get a picture
before we all go off to the big house.

1346
01:21:07,760 --> 01:21:10,240
- What a great idea.
- The big house.

1347
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,000
- You want me to do it?
- Would you?

1348
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:13,680
- All right.
- Oh, come on!

1349
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:17,840
Hey! You know, you are walking
on thin ice here, my friend!

1350
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:20,440
You are on very thin ice!

1351
01:21:22,240 --> 01:21:23,320
Let me see it.

1352
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:25,600
Don't forget to push the button
for the flash.

1353
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:27,440
Get in here, you guys.

1354
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:31,880
SHERIFF: Could you
all just scooch in a little?

1355
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:33,480
One,

1356
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:35,200
two,

1357
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:36,520
three.

1358
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:40,320
I love love
I love being in love

1359
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:42,280
I don't care
what it does to me

1360
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:47,200
Take these tattered boxes
that used to hold your clothes

1361
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:51,040
Break them down
Build them back up with your bones

1362
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:02,800
We swore we'd never
take pictures

1363
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:06,080
Pictures only prove
you can't convince

1364
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,440
Well well well

1365
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,400
If fingertips
are relationships

1366
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:28,560
Don't use this one
to point the blame

1367
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:32,040
Just sing sing

1368
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:35,760
I love love
I love being in love

1369
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:45,560
We'll take our chances

1370
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,520
We'll last a month

1371
01:23:08,640 --> 01:23:10,840
You're dressed
to have a good time

1372
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:12,040
You don't need him

1373
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:13,680
You need to be seen

1374
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:26,040
I don't care
what it does to me

1375
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:36,280
To be the new statistic

1376
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:37,840
How I love

1377
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:40,040
How I love

1378
01:23:40,120 --> 01:23:42,680
How I love being in love

1379
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,840
All you did
was construct a mess

1380
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:01,280
You're dead to me
if love is death

1381
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:04,280
You're a memory
with nothing to show

1382
01:24:04,360 --> 01:24:05,640
Well well well

1383
01:24:05,720 --> 01:24:09,840
If fingertips are
relationships then

1384
01:24:10,200 --> 01:24:13,600
Maybe I could use a break

1385
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:14,960
She smiles

1386
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:19,240
She points at me, she says
"Baby I love how you sing"

1387
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:21,920
So just sing

1388
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:26,080
I love love
I love being in love

1389
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:29,920
I don't care
what it does to me

1390
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:33,960
I love love
I love being in love

1391
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:37,080
I don't care
what it does to me

1392
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:39,480
These pills are fine
to pass the time

1393
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:41,720
Till I find my new drug

1394
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:43,640
We'll take our chances

1395
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:45,520
We'll rise above

1396
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:47,840
We'll last until the end

1397
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:53,720
I love how, I love how
I love being in love

1398
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:57,480
Just me and my puppy

1399
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:00,720
Together we're
so very happy

1400
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:05,280
And the bitter world
won't bring us down

1401
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:08,800
No, I'm looking on
the bright side of things

1402
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:13,000
It's just me and my honey

1403
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:16,720
Together we are
so very funny

1404
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:21,520
And the bitter world
won't bring us down

1405
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:24,920
No, I'm looking on
the bright side of things

1406
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:31,680
And nothing will be
taken from my hands now

1407
01:25:32,640 --> 01:25:34,240
Within me

1408
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:36,360
Resistance from me

1409
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:37,880
Nothing can last

1410
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:40,160
How can I pass

1411
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:43,480
On love and understanding

1412
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,720
Oh oh oh oh

1413
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:49,400
It's just me and my guitar

1414
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:53,840
Together we'll go
so very far

1415
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,040
And the bitter world
won't bring us down

1416
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:02,920
No, I'm looking on
the bright side of things

1417
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:20,440
Here we go now

1418
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:40,480
And nothing will be
taken from my hands now

1419
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:42,200
Within me

1420
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:44,520
A resistance from me

1421
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:46,240
Nothing can last

1422
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:48,640
How can I pass

1423
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:52,480
On love and understanding

1424
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:54,760
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

1425
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:58,280
It's just me
and the town

1426
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:01,880
Together we will
be the champs

1427
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:05,680
And the bitter world
won't bring us down

1428
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:09,200
No, I'm looking on
the bright side of things

1429
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:12,840
I'm looking on
the bright side of things

1430
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:16,480
I'm looking on
the bright side of things
