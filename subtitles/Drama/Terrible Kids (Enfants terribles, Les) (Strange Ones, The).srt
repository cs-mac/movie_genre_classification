{22871}{22953}{Y:i}"St. Simeon was 13|and tending his father's sheep

{23075}{23131}for the day shall come|when you shall weep. '
{23150}{23264}He left home to become a hermit|and lived 30 years atop a column.

{24882}{24942}What’s she look like?
{25000}{25094}- Is the teacher tough?|- No, he's nice.

{27286}{27317}The new boy.
{27322}{27392}- His name's Easter Bonnet, sir.|- Knock it off.
{27529}{27617}We know that tangents of a circle|from a given point are equal.

{27726}{27791}B equals b...
{28039}{28070}You think?
{28075}{28150}Turns your brain to mush,|but he doesn't have a lot to lose.

{31966}{32015}To bed now. Good night.
{32250}{32298}Just curl up|like a little doggie.
{32392}{32438}Did you do this?

{37286}{37324}Go on.
{37474}{37524}You should try the violin.
{37537}{37576}Do you hate music?
{37581}{37640}Not at all. But my mother|forces me to take piano.
{37646}{37745}She's right. If you stop now,|you'll always regret it.
{37770}{37805}Time's up.

{40566}{40626}{Y:i}"My darling, as you know,

{42294}{42328}I know.
{42338}{42397}But think of those|less fortunate than you.
{42467}{42536}You told your mother|you wanted to take holy orders.
{42545}{42582}She told you?
{42596}{42670}I don't think you have|any calling for the priesthood.
{42710}{42758}It’s a sorry job anyway.

{47876}{47912}I'm a Protestant.
{47917}{47984}A heretic - disgusting!

{54490}{54558}They're snooping around.|Heard there were draft dodgers here.
{54563}{54593}Draft dodgers?
{54598}{54680}Guys hiding out|to avoid forced labor in Germany.
{54686}{54742}Like Moreau, the monitor.|- Really?
{54747}{54830}Moreau's not his real name.|But I don't care.
{54843}{54898}With my leg, I'll be exempt.
{54914}{54970}- Joseph!|- Coming.
{54984}{55034}She's worse than going to Germany.
{55198}{55274}{Y:i}Rollin. Average. Nine and a half.
{55279}{55325}Bonnet? Not here.
{55330}{55374}Good riddance.
{55394}{55426}Quentin.
{55431}{55512}Intelligent, but a bit pretentious.
{55518}{55555}This, for example:
{55560}{55656}{Y:i}"Peguy sees the cathedral|as a grand and generous beacon. "
{55758}{55802}Take your seat.
{55884}{55922}Where were you?
{56051}{56105}Ciron, 12 points.
{56122}{56182}Where do you get barges|in the middle of wheat fields?
{56187}{56258}On the Foussarde Canal, sir.|I was there on vacation.
{56274}{56301}Bonnet.
{56311}{56401}131/2. Good work.|Sensitive and well-written.
{56436}{56481}Quentin, you've got competition.
{56614}{56676}Who hasn't had|his vitamin cracker?
{56723}{56779}D'Arsonval, stop lagging.
{56784}{56829}I can't pay you right away.
{56865}{56912}You promised.
{56970}{57049}Ask the little shit. I'm sure|the miser's hoarding some sugar.
{57065}{57117}Want some marbles?
{57278}{57317}{Y:i}Julien Quentin?
{57337}{57376}Wait!
{57390}{57434}Julien Quentin.
{57858}{57919}{Y:i}The apartment seems empty|without you.
{57924}{58005}{Y:i}Paris is no fun these days.|They bomb us nearly every night.
{58010}{58091}A bomb killed|eight people yesterday.
{58096}{58132}{Y:i}Charming!
{58140}{58178}{Y:i}The girls are back in school.
{58183}{58245}{Y:i}Sophie works at the Red Cross|Thursdays and Sundays.
{58250}{58297}{Y:i}So many unfortunate people.
{58304}{58369}{Y:i}Dad’s at the plant in Lille.|His factory's hardly producing.
{58374}{58418}{Y:i}He's in a foul mood.
{58428}{58485}{Y:i}It’s really time this war ended.
{58504}{58558}{Y:i}I'll come get you Sunday at 8.00,|as we agreed.
{58567}{58610}{Y:i}We'll have lunch at Le Grand Cerf.
{58618}{58677}{Y:i}Can't wait to give you a big hug.
{58685}{58722}{Y:i}Your loving mother.
{58728}{58774}{Y:i}P. S. Eat your jam.|I'll bring you more.
{58779}{58824}{Y:i}Take good care of your health.
{59814}{59846}Beat it, buddy.
{61315}{61382}{Y:i}"First prize in arithmetic - Jean...
{61694}{61746}Jean Kippel...
{61778}{61856}Kippelstein. "
{62094}{62130}I'm hungry.
{62156}{62194}What’s a perpendicular bisector?
{62199}{62290}- A perpendicular in mid-segment.|- What’s it good for?
{62843}{62890}That’s a theta, not a tau.
{63406}{63461}We'll continue next time.
{63547}{63579}Greek is useful, you know.
{63586}{63646}All scientific words|have Greek roots.
{64553}{64601}Who do you like best?|Athos or d’Artagnan?
{64606}{64643}Aramis.
{64669}{64699}He's a hypocrite.
{64704}{64749}Yeah, but he's the smartest one.
{64810}{64852}Why don't you take Greek?
{64861}{64923}- I took Latin.|- Where?
{64939}{65019}At school in Marseilles.
{65035}{65103}You're from Marseilles?|You don't have an accent.
{65137}{65181}I wasn't born there.
{65195}{65236}Where were you born?
{65268}{65336}You wouldn't know it|if I told you.
{65382}{65469}Is Greek hard?|- Not once you know the alphabet.
{65474}{65525}Are your parents in Marseilles?
{65686}{65724}My dad’s a prisoner.
{65729}{65769}He didn't escape?
{65798}{65857}And where's your mother?
{65953}{65993}You won't tell me?
{66003}{66059}{Y:i}- In the unoccupied zone.|- There's no unoccupied zone anymore.
{66064}{66138}I know that. Now lay off.|I don't know where she is.
{66143}{66208}She hasn't written in three months.|Happy now?
{66353}{66401}What are you two up to?
{66432}{66485}I have a cold.
{66522}{66579}Enough nonsense.|Go out and play.
{66677}{66739}Hippo's a bastard.|Always snooping around.
{66828}{66936}{Y:i}St. Thomas's proofs|of God’s existence don't hold water.
{66942}{66985}I don't agree.
{66994}{67067}Since we can imagine God,|he must exist.
{67093}{67121}That’s just sophistry.
{67126}{67209}At least Bergson seeks|transcendence in science.
{67231}{67285}Hey, I want to talk to you.
{67405}{67479}- That’s strong.|- It’s the real thing, dummy.
{67547}{67622}Let’s go somewhere else.|The monkeys will catch us here.
{67713}{67753}- Do me a favor.|- What?
{67758}{67809}Pass a note to your piano teacher.
{67814}{67879}{Y:i}- You're crazy! I'll get expelled!|- She won't say anything.
{67884}{67922}You're such a scaredy-cat.
{67958}{68005}François, what’s a yid?
{68010}{68085}- A Jew.|- I know, but what exactly is a Jew?
{68090}{68154}- Someone who doesn't eat pork.|- Are you kidding me?
{68159}{68195}Not at all.
{68202}{68245}What have people got against them?
{68250}{68326}The fact they're smarter than us,|and they crucified Jesus.
{68331}{68375}That’s not true.|It was the Romans.
{68386}{68453}Is that why they have|to wear yellow stars?
{68458}{68515}- Will you take my letter to Davenne?|- No.
{68520}{68569}What do you want with her anyway?|- Never mind.
{68574}{68658}{Y:i}Be nice. I'll lend you my|Arabian Nights. It’ll give you a hard-on.
{68667}{68709}{Y:i}Leave me alone!
{68826}{68865}You smell awful, Joseph.
{68894}{68953}Stop it, right now!
{68993}{69032}He called me a creep!
{69037}{69110}That’s enough now.|Calm down and go back to the kitchen.
{69137}{69197}{Y:i}"Down, Joseph!|To your kennel!"
{69202}{69244}I'm not a dog!
{69249}{69289}Stop it, D'Arsonval!
{69567}{69645}Damn, a cross.|Another wrong trail.
{69714}{69780}We have to get back to the crossroads,|quickly and quietly.
{69814}{69869}There must be another trail|at the fork.
{69928}{69969}I wonder where the others are.
{69988}{70016}What’s today?
{70021}{70080}January 17. Thursday.
{70097}{70191}{Y:i}You realize there'll never be|another January 17, 1944?
{70201}{70243}Never again.
{70253}{70288}Shut up and get a move on!
{70293}{70366}In 40 years,|half these guys'll be dead and buried.
{70387}{70430}Come on.
{70439}{70528}I'm the only one in this school|who thinks about death. It’s incredible!
{70667}{70740}You're our prisoners.|Follow us.
{70745}{70796}We're gonna tie your hands.
{70898}{70946}There are two missing.|Over there! It’s Quentin!
{73706}{73739}Wow!
{74317}{74400}I found the treasure.|The Greens win.
{77441}{77476}Didn't they catch you?
{77481}{77555}Yes, they tied me to a tree,|but I got free.
{77560}{77595}Bastards!
{77641}{77689}I found the treasure.|All by myself.
{77814}{77865}Are there wolves in these woods?
{78182}{78217}It’s that way.
{80178}{80208}We go left. I'm sure.
{80213}{80281}- No, we go right.|- I told you, we go left.
{81594}{81658}It’s the high wall|next to the church, right?
{81674}{81757}I know it.|We Bavarians are Catholic.
{82001}{82078}Good evening, Father.|Lost any children?
{82083}{82171}We looked everywhere.|Always playing the fool, Julien!
{82176}{82262}That’s not fair.|I found the treasure.
{82270}{82353}But everyone had vanished.
{82468}{82515}It’s all right, my boy.
{82520}{82558}What happened?
{82570}{82618}They got arrested by the Krauts.
{82644}{82676}Could the Krauts
{82681}{82713}have their blanket back?
{82759}{82796}Thank you very much.
{82808}{82910}No civilians in the woods after 8:00 p. m.|Don't you know there's a curfew?
{82915}{82963}You think we did it on purpose?
{82981}{83030}I caught hell because of you.
{83035}{83069}You won because of me, jerk.
{83074}{83115}Come on. Hurry up.
{83494}{83530}Calm down.
{83535}{83569}Lafarge, out!
{83733}{83771}Feeling better, twerp?
{83779}{83833}A present from Joseph.
{83849}{83890}And a letter from your mom.
{83895}{83931}She's your mom too.
{83936}{83977}But you're her pet.
{83983}{84035}Dad’s always off in Lille.|I bet she's getting plenty.
{84040}{84117}- What do you mean?|- Women are all whores, my friend.
{84124}{84156}Sorry, Sister.
{84161}{84193}What an idiot!
{84198}{84248}- Swabbing time.|- Again?
{84254}{84315}Three times a day.|Sit up straight.
{84352}{84392}Open your mouth.
{84401}{84481}Open wide.|Keep your tongue down.
{84700}{84768}Listen here!|Open your mouth!
{85074}{85146}- Were you scared last night?|- Not really.
{85151}{85199}I hear you saw some wild boar.
{85204}{85259}Were there lots?|- Around 50.
{85284}{85331}What about the Germans?
{85338}{85386}Did they really fire at you?
{85396}{85447}- Just a few bursts.|- Come on!
{85492}{85528}Nice book.
{85558}{85592}What is it?
{85597}{85652}{Y:i}The Arabian Nights.|It’s my brother's.
{85657}{85704}It’s banned by the monkeys.|- Why?
{85710}{85778}It’s really dirty.|I'll lend it to you.
{85783}{85827}Recess is over.
{85905}{85956}We've got our religion class.
{85961}{85998}See you tomorrow.
{86047}{86105}- Kiss Mother Michel for me.|- Oh, we will.
{86184}{86226}{Y:i}The Arabian Nights.
{86852}{86888}You're disgusting.
{86899}{86940}It doesn't hurt it.
{86958}{86997}It’s dead.
{87085}{87137}A present from Joseph.
{87189}{87233}{Y:i}No, thanks.|I don't like pate.
{87238}{87273}Go on. Eat it.
{87278}{87329}{Y:i}I said no.|I don't like pate.
{87380}{87427}Because it’s pork?
{87450}{87507}Why do you always ask|such stupid questions?
{87535}{87607}Because your name's Kippelstein,|not Bonnet.
{87636}{87713}{Y:i}Do you say "Kippelstine"|or "Kippelsteen"?
{87906}{87973}Bonnet, get back in bed|this minute or I'll report you!
{88045}{88087}And you quiet down.
{88445}{88507}- Are your parents coming?|- The whole family.
{88754}{88817}Aren't you dressing up?|No visitors?
{88827}{88881}What the hell is it to you?
{89311}{89405}My message today is especially|for the youngest among you
{89410}{89483}who will be confirmed|in a few weeks.
{89493}{89520}My children,
{89525}{89576}we live in a time|of discord and hatred.
{89584}{89663}Lies are all-powerful.|Christians kill one another.
{89670}{89731}Those who should guide us|betray us instead.
{89741}{89841}More than ever, we must beware|of selfishness and indifference.
{89865}{89956}You're all from wealthy families,|some very wealthy.
{89973}{90067}Because you've been given much,|much will be asked of you.
{90081}{90145}Remember the Bible's stern lesson:
{90150}{90233}{Y:i}"It’s easier for a camel|to pass through the eye of a needle
{90240}{90322}than for a rich man|to enter the kingdom of heaven. "
{90327}{90358}St. James said,
{90363}{90488}{Y:i}"Now, you rich, weep and wail|for the woes awaiting you. "
{90493}{90590}Your wealth has rotted,|and your garments are eaten by worms. "
{90607}{90697}Worldly wealth corrupts souls|and withers hearts.
{90702}{90788}It makes men contemptuous, unjust,
{90793}{90848}pitiless in their egoism.
{90854}{90924}I understand the anger|of those who have nothing
{90929}{91009}when the rich feast so arrogantly.
{91235}{91278}He's hitting pretty hard.
{91334}{91362}I don't mean to shock you
{91367}{91476}but only remind you|that charity is a Christian's first duty.
{91489}{91562}St. Paul tells us in today's Epistle,
{91567}{91654}{Y:i}"Brothers, be not wise|in your own conceits.
{91659}{91707}Do not repay any man|evil for evil.
{91718}{91781}If thine enemy hunger, feed him.
{91785}{91840}If he thirst, give him drink. "
{91877}{91979}Let us pray for the hungry,|for those who suffer,
{91987}{92036}for the persecuted.
{92053}{92103}Let us pray for the victims
{92112}{92165}and for their executioners as well.
{93834}{93904}{Y:i}- Will you give concerts?|- Not right away.
{93909}{93952}I still need practice.
{93962}{94024}It’s hard to get started.
{94069}{94100}It’s Duvallier's dog.
{94105}{94168}- It’ll bite you.|- He doesn't bite.
{94280}{94325}En garde, Easter Bonnet.
{94363}{94424}Help me, you guys!|Get the heretic!
{94501}{94550}You're really getting on my nerves.
{94562}{94611}Go, Julien!
{94770}{94827}Julien, have you gone mad!
{94876}{94921}Your best suit.
{94939}{94997}What’ll they say at the restaurant?
{95063}{95132}What’s gotten into you boys?|You think it’s funny?
{95468}{95504}Was everything all right, Mr. Meyer?
{95509}{95582}Thank you.|The rabbit was tolerable.
{95602}{95663}Mrs. Quentin,|your table's this way.
{95686}{95767}François, sit over there.|Julien here.
{95866}{95940}- We haven't seen you lately.|- Vacations.
{96037}{96068}What fish do you have?
{96073}{96144}We haven't had fish in ages, ma'am.
{96149}{96264}I recommend the rabbit.|Half a meal coupon per serving.
{96269}{96316}Is it rabbit or cat?
{96325}{96381}Rabbit, sir.|With sauteed potatoes.
{96385}{96469}- In butter?|- Margarine.
{96481}{96516}No coupons required.
{96521}{96631}Very well. We'll have the rabbit,|and a bottle of Bordeaux.
{96838}{96868}The place is full of Krauts.
{96873}{96935}I thought they were all|on the Russian front.
{96943}{96989}You caught their eye.
{97089}{97141}Your parents couldn't come?
{97167}{97198}Poor boy.
{97205}{97237}What about Dad?
{97242}{97314}He said he was coming.|- He couldn't. Problems at the plant.
{97319}{97349}As usual.
{97354}{97428}Your poor father|is under a lot of pressure.
{97436}{97519}{Y:i}- Is he still for Petain?|- No one is anymore.
{97528}{97633}I heard of your ordeal in the woods.|I gave Father Jean a piece of my mind.
{97643}{97702}{Y:i}Those boy scout games are ludicrous|in this freezing cold.
{97707}{97753}You could’ve died, my darling.
{97765}{97836}Guns do go off!|- Makes a man of him.
{97841}{97932}That’s just what Father Jean said.
{97937}{97964}I mean really!
{97969}{98036}- He was with me in the woods.|- Oh, so it was you.
{98066}{98119}I bet you're from Lyon.
{98124}{98177}The name Gillet is from Lyon.|They're all in the silk trade.
{98189}{98240}His name's Bonnet, not Gillet.
{98248}{98281}Of course.
{98286}{98319}He's from Marseilles.
{98324}{98424}I knew a Bonnet there, a cousin|of the Du Perrons. Is she your mother?
{98490}{98528}How strange.
{98553}{98594}His father's an accountant.
{98602}{98634}Really.
{98965}{99009}Your papers, please.
{99179}{99213}Your papers, sir.
{99635}{99701}Can't you read?
{99705}{99749}This place is off limits to yids.
{99912}{99960}Why are those men bothering people?
{99970}{100020}That gentleman looks very proper.
{100057}{100097}Mr. Meyer's been coming here|for 20 years.
{100109}{100181}I can't just throw him out.|- Shut up, flunky!
{100201}{100258}I can have your license revoked.
{100278}{100303}Collaborators.
{100308}{100344}Quiet, François.
{100372}{100412}Did you say that?
{100418}{100472}He's a child.|He doesn't know what he's saying.
{100481}{100571}We serve France, lady.|He insulted us.
{100593}{100644}Go away!
{100691}{100768}It’s monstrous.|You should be ashamed.
{100779}{100813}Not at all.
{100921}{100956}Leave him alone.
{100961}{101023}He's right.|Send the Jews to Moscow!
{101172}{101214}Get the hell out of here!
{101283}{101344}You understand?|Get the hell out!
{101635}{101672}We'll meet again.
{101757}{101817}Say what you will,|but some of them are decent.
{101825}{101873}He was showing off for you.
{102138}{102173}Aren't we Jewish?
{102185}{102261}- That’s all we need!|- Isn't Aunt Reinach Jewish?
{102271}{102339}- She's Alsatian.|- You can be Alsatian and Jewish.
{102348}{102416}That’s quite enough!|The Reinachs are devout Catholics!
{102433}{102476}If they heard you!
{102484}{102556}Mind you,|I have nothing against Jews.
{102563}{102648}{Y:i}Except for that Leon Blum.|They can hang him.
{102739}{102787}Julien, sit up straight.
{102857}{102913}Your friend is nice.|He doesn't say much.
{102918}{102953}He has his reasons.
{102958}{103030}- Then he's no dummy.|- Not at all.
{103082}{103142}Where's François?|What’s he up to?
{103147}{103222}He always gives the Krauts|wrong directions.
{103229}{103266}Very clever!
{103365}{103448}- What if I joined the resistance?|- Nonsense. You must finish school.
{103453}{103517}Some things are|more important than school.
{103531}{103566}Julien wants to become a monkey.
{103571}{103629}Not a monkey.|A missionary in the Congo.
{103633}{103714}Stop using that stupid word.|It’s awful.
{103723}{103777}You should be grateful|to those poor monks who -
{103782}{103841}{Y:i}"... work so hard to educate you. "
{103853}{103888}Precisely!
{103922}{103989}You're a real pain.|Leave me alone.
{104040}{104082}Fernande!
{104154}{104192}You know her?
{104250}{104308}Julien, are you sure|you want to become a priest?
{104313}{104363}- Would you object?|- Not at all.
{104370}{104425}Your father and I would be proud.
{104445}{104518}But why not engineering,|like Grandpa?
{104523}{104560}Don't worry.
{104565}{104652}He'll give up the church for a girl.|He's a lover boy, like Joseph.
{104888}{104957}Laviron's sister is a real dish.
{104968}{105011}I'm gonna sweet-talk her.
{105173}{105220}I can't kiss you anymore?
{105252}{105321}Look at that.|You've got a little mustache.
{105358}{105451}Can I go back to Paris with you?|Dad won't know.
{105815}{105857}Did you have a good lunch?
{106017}{106096}Your mother's nice.|Boy, can she talk fast.
{106105}{106138}{Y:i}She's crazy.
{106229}{106273}You'll see her again soon.
{106381}{106420}I know how to thread it.
{106425}{106493}It’ll break like last time.
{106497}{106539}No, it won't.
{106704}{106748}{Y:i}Your jam's great.
{106761}{106823}- Adrienne made it.|- Is that your sister?
{106830}{106872}No, she's the cook.
{106923}{106973}What’s funny?|Don't you have a cook?
{106992}{107064}You always eat out?|- No. My mom's a great cook.
{107286}{107341}- You're eating my jam.|- Stop it.
{107346}{107389}Move over, guys.
{107488}{107526}We're ready.
{107541}{107595}Turn out the lights, please.
{109170}{109217}The fat lady's gonna go sliding.
{109244}{109289}Looks like Mrs. Perrin.
{110272}{110307}She's beautiful.
{111236}{111279}He's in love.
{111319}{111356}She loves him too.
{112692}{112724}Shit!
{113151}{113189}Time to get up.
{113201}{113254}Quentin wets the bed.
{113276}{113333}Quentin wets the bed.
{113503}{113562}{Y:i}Hurry up in the washroom.
{113571}{113617}It never fails.
{113649}{113697}I'm having a great dream.
{113702}{113791}I feel like peeing.|I open my fly. Everything's great.
{113841}{113922}Then I wake up and feel|the warm piss on my stomach.
{113941}{113980}It’s no fun, let me tell you.
{114087}{114131}Try it. Don't be scared.
{114161}{114216}Go on. Keep your head up.
{114302}{114335}Get back up.
{114344}{114414}- Bed wetter.|- Sagard, you're gonna get it.
{114504}{114557}You dirty thief!
{114562}{114597}You're the thief!
{114601}{114656}Just you wait, you thief!
{114685}{114743}Father Michel,|I caught him stealing lard!
{114748}{114795}He put it in his bag to sell!
{114824}{114869}Not in front of the boys, Mrs. Perrin!
{114873}{114946}- I told you he was stealing!|- It’s not true, damn it!
{114951}{115009}She's the thief!|She's a liar!
{115017}{115059}Get back in the kitchen.
{115112}{115169}I told that idiot he'd get caught.
{115253}{115344}Joseph was selling our supplies|on the black market.
{115361}{115458}Mrs. Perrin should have told us.|She may have been in on it.
{115466}{115509}But that’s not all.
{115531}{115628}We found these in his locker.|Private food supplies.
{115638}{115683}He named all seven of you.
{115688}{115735}{Y:i}Whose pate is this?
{115751}{115785}Mine.
{115789}{115849}- And the jam?|- Mine.
{115867}{115907}Know what you are?
{115912}{115969}A thief, just like Joseph.
{115974}{116033}I didn't steal.|That jam was mine.
{116038}{116080}You should’ve shared it.
{116091}{116157}I believe true education|consists in teaching you
{116161}{116214}to make good use|of your freedom.
{116227}{116257}And this is what happens!
{116290}{116377}You disgust me. There's nothing|I despise more than the black market.
{116388}{116422}Always money!
{116431}{116491}It wasn't for money.|We traded, that’s all.
{116498}{116534}For what?
{116541}{116569}Cigarettes.
{116574}{116687}Quentin, if it weren't for your parents,|I'd kick you out at once.
{116693}{116735}You and your brother.
{116772}{116829}I have to fire Joseph,|even though it’s unfair.
{116890}{116948}You're all confined to school|until Easter.
{116983}{117029}Now go back to class.
{117215}{117293}Where do I go now?|I don't even have a place to sleep.
{117372}{117407}Get back to class.
{117609}{117671}Go see the bursar.|He'll pay you a month's wages.
{117676}{117762}I end up taking the rap.|It’s not fair.
{117825}{117861}Come on, Joseph.
{118388}{118448}- What are you doing here?|- Choir practice.
{118453}{118528}You two help me|with the flowers for Sunday.
{118753}{118815}{Y:i}We'll take it from|"O Lord, in thee... "
{118865}{118904}Bonnet’s not here?
{118909}{118980}- No, miss. He's in the infirmary.|- Really?
{119686}{119758}It’s easy.|Do this with your left hand.
{120137}{120176}We'd better get to the shelter.
{120279}{120352}{Y:i}Everyone in the shelter, and hurry!
{120631}{120700}They won't miss us.|They never count.
{122113}{122174}I hope the Americans land soon.
{122234}{122286}Will you stay at this school|when the war's over?
{122342}{122390}I don't know. I doubt it.
{122504}{122541}You scared?
{122588}{122624}All the time.
{122754}{122798}How long's it been|since you saw him?
{122829}{122896}My father?|Almost two years.
{122965}{123013}I never see mine either.
{123405}{123445}What are you doing here, Joseph?
{123481}{123524}I forgot some things.
{123591}{123630}What about you?
{123911}{123992}{Y:i}"Could I, lad,|belong to anyone but you?
{124014}{124095}She swiftly cast aside her veils,|removed her clothing,
{124100}{124152}and appeared naked|as the day she was born.
{124157}{124210}Blessed be the womb that bore her.
{124223}{124311}The princess was|as soft and white as fine linen.
{124317}{124379}Her whole being|exuded a scent of amber.
{124393}{124450}He took her in his arms,
{124455}{124537}probing her intimate depths,|and found she was a virgin pearl.
{124544}{124628}His hand roved|over her lovely limbs and neck
{124633}{124700}and through|the richness of her hair.
{124715}{124809}She responded by eagerly displaying|her many gifts.
{124814}{124910}She had the sinuous grace of Araby,|Ethiopian ardor,
{124915}{124993}the startled candor of the French,|the high art of the Indians,
{124997}{125038}Yemeni coyness,
{125043}{125140}and the narrow passage|of a Chinese girl.
{125201}{125269}Each embrace became a coupling,
{125273}{125348}and each coupling|the wildest fornication,
{125353}{125446}until, weary from|their passionate writings,
{125451}{125570}they fell asleep in each other's arms,|drunk with pleasure.
{125578}{125625}Thus ended -"
{125793}{125880}The Russians have begun|a major offensive in the Ukraine.
{125904}{125999}British radio claims|the Germans have been overrun
{126004}{126069}along a 60-mile front west of Kiev.
{126075}{126134}Radio Paris claims|the attack was repulsed
{126139}{126183}with heavy losses.
{126197}{126266}The truth is likely|somewhere between the two.
{126271}{126341}{Y:i}Radio Paris tells German lies
{126345}{126384}Meanwhile, in Italy,
{126389}{126516}the Americans and British|are pinned down at Monte Cassino.
{126536}{126607}Take out your notebooks|for an algebra problem.
{126658}{126730}We're going to multiply|two monomials.
{126773}{126835}May I be excused, sir?|It’s the soup.
{126842}{126899}It’s always you, Sagard.|Go on.
{127741}{127797}Dr. Müller. Gestapo.
{127873}{127942}Which one of you|is Jean Kippelstein?
{128057}{128096}Answer me.
{128111}{128151}There's no one by that name|in this class.
{129537}{129577}Let’s go.
{130313}{130360}That boy is not French.
{130400}{130446}He's a Jew.
{130478}{130609}Your principal committed|a serious crime by hiding him.
{130708}{130741}The school is closed.
{130746}{130843}You have two hours to pack your bags|and line up in the yard.
{130985}{131032}Was Bonnet a Jew?
{131149}{131197}Keep calm, children.
{131317}{131383}Quiet down|and listen to me, children.
{131417}{131473}They've arrested Father Jean.
{131525}{131562}It seems we've been denounced.
{131575}{131621}What about Bonnet?
{131625}{131673}{Y:i}Bonnet, Dupre and Lafarge|are Jewish.
{131686}{131754}Father Jean took them in|because their lives were in danger.
{131784}{131885}Go to the dormitory|and pack quickly and calmly.
{131893}{131967}But first we'll say a prayer|for Father Jean and your friends.
{132007}{132092}Our Father, who art in heaven...
{132576}{132620}Negus got away.
{132685}{132717}They didn't get Negus.
{132722}{132823}They're looking for him and Moreau.|Father Jean had resistance leaflets.
{132845}{132920}When you're ready,|go to the dining hall.
{132927}{133027}Quentin, pack Laviron's bag|and take it to the infirmary. Hurry!
{133032}{133070}Want some help?
{134364}{134452}Don't worry.|They'd have gotten me anyway.
{134524}{134564}Negus got away.
{134571}{134605}I know.
{134771}{134820}Take these.|I've read them all.
{135025}{135070}{Y:i}You want The Arabian Nights?
{135705}{135772}- What are you doing here?|- I brought his bag.
{135857}{135899}Are you gonna get up?
{135986}{136012}What do you want now?
{136017}{136065}We can't stay here.|They're searching the attic.
{136509}{136560}Sister, put a compress on him!
{136565}{136595}Hurry!
{136601}{136657}You'll get us all arrested!
{137289}{137353}There's a Jew here.|I'm sure of it.
{137367}{137401}We haven't seen anyone.
{137406}{137465}You, come here.
{137524}{137578}Pull down your pants. Quick!
{138750}{138788}What happened?
{138795}{138856}- It’s her.|- Get out!
{138900}{138966}I'm going over the roof.|Good-bye, Julien.
{139689}{139744}He's a friend.
{139879}{139933}What are you doing with them?
{140037}{140070}Here.
{140131}{140180}Aren't you happy?|You'll get a vacation.
{140404}{140440}You don't smoke?
{140641}{140693}Don't worry about it.|They're just Jews.
{140815}{140857}You really liked Bonnet?
{141045}{141100}Don't act so pious!|You guys are to blame!
{141107}{141173}I got fired|for doing business with you.
{141177}{141226}Mrs. Perrin stole more than I did.
{141337}{141378}Stop acting so pious!
{141383}{141436}There's a war going on, kid.
{141937}{141993}Are there any other Jews among you?
{142057}{142090}Answer me!
{142582}{142656}What about you?|Sure you're not Jewish?
{142661}{142691}Your name?
{142696}{142740}{Y:i}Pierre de la Rozière.
{142747}{142795}Go stand against the wall.
{143841}{143887}You think they'll arrest us?
{143894}{143940}We didn't do anything.
{144534}{144581}We were in the chapel.
{144595}{144663}We came for confession.
{144903}{144960}That soldier did his duty.
{144977}{145043}His orders were|to let no one leave.
{145081}{145175}The strength of the German soldier|is his discipline.
{145201}{145288}That’s what you French lack:|Discipline.
{145389}{145431}We're not your enemies.
{145442}{145541}You must help us rid France|of foreigners and Jews.
{146401}{146472}Good-bye, Father.
{146560}{146621}Good-bye, children.|See you soon.
{147195}{147249}{Y:i}Bonnet, Negus and Dupre
{147253}{147293}{Y:i}died at Auschwitz.
{147298}{147364}{Y:i}Father Jean|died in the camp at Mauthausen.
{147393}{147486}{Y:i}The school reopened its doors|in October of 1944.
{147501}{147548}{Y:i}More than 40 years have passed,
{147553}{147681}{Y:i}but I'll remember every second of that|January morning until the day I die.
