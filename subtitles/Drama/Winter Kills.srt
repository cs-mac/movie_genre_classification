1
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:41,559
hello, this is
yvette malone speaking.

2
00:02:41,627 --> 00:02:44,595
I'm not home just now,
but if you'll be kind enough...

3
00:02:44,663 --> 00:02:49,201
To leave your name
and telephone number,
I'll call you when I return.

4
00:02:49,268 --> 00:02:51,203
Please begin at the tone.

5
00:02:53,272 --> 00:02:56,674
Yvette, nick here.
Uh, I just thought
I'd let you know that...

6
00:02:56,742 --> 00:03:00,778
I'm still on pa's ship
off the coast of malaysia
thinking about you.

7
00:03:00,846 --> 00:03:04,449
And, uh, sure is nice
to hear your voice.
Even if it is recorded.

8
00:03:04,516 --> 00:03:07,118
<i>well, we're getting some
rough weather here, honey.</i>

9
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:10,622
So, uh,
I guess I-
they want you
to go up, sir.

10
00:03:43,372 --> 00:03:45,206
Okay, let's go.

11
00:03:53,282 --> 00:03:55,417
All right,
now move your asses.

12
00:03:55,484 --> 00:03:58,320
Get him to sick bay,
and do it now.

13
00:04:01,724 --> 00:04:03,658
Ha!
Well, if it isn't
mr. Keifitz.

14
00:04:03,726 --> 00:04:05,560
Lookin' more like
your father every day.

15
00:04:05,627 --> 00:04:08,313
You came all the way
out here to tell me that?

16
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:12,033
No, no, sir.
I brought you an assassin.

17
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:16,521
- A what?
- Yeah, well, that man
that they're moving there.

18
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,824
He says he shot your brother.
He was second rifle
at city hall.

19
00:04:21,777 --> 00:04:24,079
It's an outrage
to bring this man here.

20
00:04:24,146 --> 00:04:28,834
You prefer the native hospital
in brunei where a man can die
of athlete's foot.

21
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:31,936
I don't have the facilities.
This man fell off an oil rig.

22
00:04:32,004 --> 00:04:33,938
Doctor,
will you leave us?

23
00:04:34,006 --> 00:04:36,541
Then I take
no responsibility.

24
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,610
That's right.

25
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:43,081
And you, out.

26
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:46,551
And you, stay.

27
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:50,255
Now, can you write?
Sir?

28
00:04:50,322 --> 00:04:53,725
English. Can you
write english?
I think so, sir.

29
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,098
Do your best.

30
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:03,201
Be our witness.
Just write down
whatever he says.

31
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,543
Fletcher!
You hear me?

32
00:05:13,362 --> 00:05:17,983
Nick kegan is here.
You understand?

33
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,530
I think he wants
to shake your hand.

34
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:46,711
Now, what's
your full name?

35
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:49,248
Arthur turkus fletcher.

36
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:52,617
How old are you?

37
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,453
Fifty-eight years.

38
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:58,673
We will hear your testimony.

39
00:06:02,011 --> 00:06:04,679
I shot president kegan.

40
00:06:05,748 --> 00:06:08,750
<i>Jesus.</i>

41
00:06:08,817 --> 00:06:11,135
How?

42
00:06:11,203 --> 00:06:17,074
I was second rifle in city hall,
February 22, 1960.

43
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,078
I hit with both shots.

44
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:24,499
Where was
the number one rifle?

45
00:06:24,566 --> 00:06:26,968
Behind the wall.

46
00:06:27,036 --> 00:06:32,107
I shot on the line with him.

47
00:06:32,175 --> 00:06:34,276
Who hired you?

48
00:06:35,878 --> 00:06:39,381
Junior. Casper jr.

49
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:44,802
They remembered me
from shooting demonstrations
for the rifle association.

50
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:49,274
Said he'd push me into history.

51
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:53,044
Twenty-five thousand dollars
for a morning's work.

52
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:55,864
A morning's work.

53
00:06:55,931 --> 00:06:58,065
Please,

54
00:06:59,435 --> 00:07:01,969
Mr. Kegan,

55
00:07:02,037 --> 00:07:07,041
The rifle's in the steam pipe
under the middle window
in the engleson building.

56
00:07:07,109 --> 00:07:10,645
Room 903.

57
00:07:10,712 --> 00:07:13,982
I left my fingerprints
and all with my name
taped to it...

58
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:18,370
For when the time came to prove
that I killed the president.

59
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:23,841
What about willy arnold?
The pickering commission proved
willie arnold shot my brother.

60
00:07:27,413 --> 00:07:31,132
<i>Nick, he's dead.</i>

61
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:37,021
You can't run away
from this.

62
00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:39,607
get a hold of
miles garner in philly,

63
00:07:39,675 --> 00:07:42,510
Have him meet me
at the airport with
some long underwear.

64
00:07:42,578 --> 00:07:44,913
It'll be
freezing there.
What are you gonna do?

65
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:49,517
I'm gonna look
for his rifle.
Mm.

66
00:07:49,585 --> 00:07:53,354
<i>whether this guy
is real or not, pa'll understand
I had to leave the ship.</i>

67
00:07:53,422 --> 00:07:57,692
- I'm sure he will.
- I hope so.

68
00:08:09,972 --> 00:08:11,906
You get that down?

69
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,344
I'll look at it.

70
00:08:19,781 --> 00:08:22,584
Jesus, you print
like an ape.

71
00:08:22,651 --> 00:08:24,885
I'm a high school graduate.

72
00:08:24,953 --> 00:08:27,388
But I've never been involved
in anything like this.

73
00:08:39,568 --> 00:08:41,636
Now,

74
00:08:41,704 --> 00:08:46,140
You were just a little boy
when president kegan...

75
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:49,944
Was gunned down
in philadelphia.

76
00:08:50,012 --> 00:08:54,349
But in the subsequent
19 years,

77
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:57,685
More than 16 people,

78
00:08:57,753 --> 00:09:03,257
Who seemingly
had nothing to do
with that awful event,

79
00:09:04,326 --> 00:09:09,030
Have died under
mysterious conditions.

80
00:09:13,402 --> 00:09:17,756
If what you say is true,
nick, it's gonna shake up
a lot of people.

81
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:21,225
President, congress,
everyone.
Especially pa.

82
00:09:21,293 --> 00:09:24,662
Does he know?
No, not yet.

83
00:09:29,251 --> 00:09:32,953
I guess this assassin thought
nobody'd look for him, working
for the president's father, huh?

84
00:09:33,021 --> 00:09:35,222
We're gonna need a wrench
for the steam pipe.

85
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,291
We'll get it
from the building supervisor.

86
00:09:38,894 --> 00:09:42,196
Captain heller, this way.

87
00:09:42,264 --> 00:09:45,066
Captain heller,
that's the wrong building!

88
00:09:49,304 --> 00:09:52,473
Is he reliable, miles?
Captain heller,
philadelphia's finest.

89
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:56,911
He drinks a bit, but if
there's a rifle up there,
he'll know how to handle it.

90
00:09:56,978 --> 00:10:00,848
Captain heller, nick kegan.
We have no time
to lose, captain.

91
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:04,652
You say you're
nicholas kegan?
That's right.

92
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,654
Got any identification?

93
00:10:09,157 --> 00:10:12,860
<i>Come on. I've known
nick since he was a boy.
He's tom kegan's son.</i>

94
00:10:12,928 --> 00:10:14,929
Our late president's
half-brother, okay?

95
00:10:14,996 --> 00:10:17,131
You'll vouch for him?
Of course, yes.

96
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:20,201
Good enough. Now, uh,
what's the problem here,
fellas?

97
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,399
It's this way, captain.

98
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,168
Oh. Kegan,

99
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,704
We did everything possible
to protect your brother here.

100
00:10:39,771 --> 00:10:41,906
But you can't protect
anyone against a nut.

101
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:45,210
Nine-oh-three.
Damn shame.

102
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:48,813
Police, open up.
Open up in there.
Police.

103
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,421
You john kullers?

104
00:10:57,456 --> 00:11:02,310
- We'd like to have a look
at your steam pipe.
- My steam pipe?

105
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:05,530
We'll get a search warrant
if necessary.

106
00:11:05,597 --> 00:11:08,349
Search warrant
for a steam pipe?

107
00:11:11,287 --> 00:11:13,671
how long have you
occupied these premises?

108
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:16,641
<i>cops. Why me?
Answer the question.</i>

109
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:20,178
<i>Four years, I don't know.
Where were you
on February 22, 1960.</i>

110
00:11:20,245 --> 00:11:24,315
<i>1960? What is this?
You don't remember the date
president kegan was shot?</i>

111
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:28,486
Long island. In school.
Mrs. Sayers' eighth grade
english class.

112
00:11:28,554 --> 00:11:30,471
Oh, yeah?

113
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:32,573
Look, hey, I got
a legitimate
operation here.

114
00:11:32,641 --> 00:11:35,509
All right, miles.
I'll check it.
Stand back.

115
00:12:26,194 --> 00:12:28,730
I'm sorry.

116
00:12:28,797 --> 00:12:31,566
Sorry? What for?

117
00:12:31,634 --> 00:12:34,669
Now you'll have to
live it all over again.

118
00:12:34,737 --> 00:12:36,971
I could put it back.

119
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:39,040
You'll always
know where it was.

120
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:02,497
Oh, the hell with it.

121
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,868
What's that?
What is that?
That's not mine.

122
00:13:06,936 --> 00:13:09,437
You make one sound
about what you saw
here today,

123
00:13:09,505 --> 00:13:11,606
And you'll be
the sorriest little man
in the sticks.

124
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,761
Boy, this'll stink
right up to heaven.

125
00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:20,198
Yeah, this is the kind
of thing that rises.

126
00:13:24,636 --> 00:13:28,105
Hey, take this. I don't
like the way it feels.

127
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:34,445
- Where to, captain?
- Bring it to the f.B.I.,
wouldn't you say?

128
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:36,447
Oh, why not?
They probably built it.

129
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:41,085
"they probably built it."

130
00:13:58,854 --> 00:14:01,856
Miles! Miles.

131
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,537
Help!

132
00:14:30,485 --> 00:14:32,419
Phone? Do you have-

133
00:14:43,365 --> 00:14:46,801
Mr. Kegan's office.
Who's calling, operator?

134
00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:50,421
Yes, we will.
Hello, mr. Kegan?

135
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:53,858
No, I'm sorry.
Your father left for
rockrimmon last night.

136
00:14:53,925 --> 00:14:55,860
I'm not sure.
I'll give you rosemary.

137
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:07,037
Yes, nick.
How nice to hear from you.

138
00:15:07,105 --> 00:15:10,307
Your father's left the house
already for his golf.

139
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,309
May I help you?

140
00:15:12,377 --> 00:15:14,945
In the desert, yes.

141
00:15:15,013 --> 00:15:18,683
Well, how urgent?
I see.

142
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,819
Oh, dear.
I'd better connect you
with john cerruti. Hold on.

143
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,880
Nick. Surprise, surprise.
How are you? Where are you?

144
00:15:32,948 --> 00:15:36,016
You left the boat, nick.
Left the ship.
That's naughty of you.

145
00:15:36,084 --> 00:15:38,385
Very bad not telling
headquarters. Your father-

146
00:15:38,453 --> 00:15:40,387
What? What rifle?

147
00:15:42,123 --> 00:15:46,728
Uh-huh. In philadelphia?
Well, that's astonishing.

148
00:15:46,795 --> 00:15:49,296
Well, it's startling.
Shocking about miles.

149
00:15:49,364 --> 00:15:52,466
Listen,
now where are you now?
Exactly where?

150
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:56,571
Okay, follow me carefully.
Do nothing. I'll handle
the police. You wait for a car.

151
00:15:56,638 --> 00:16:00,140
We'll pick you up and
you can discuss this with
your father in rockrimmon.

152
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:02,777
And nick, don't panic.
Panic is counterproductive.

153
00:16:54,579 --> 00:16:58,082
How are you, keith?
The same. Always the same.

154
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,951
And you,
you're looking good.

155
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,987
where's pa?
He's playing golf.

156
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:04,955
But he should be
back any time now.

157
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:09,476
I've got to see him right away.
Hey, shogun. Shogun. Shogun.

158
00:17:11,646 --> 00:17:14,949
You've been gone
a long time, nick.

159
00:17:15,017 --> 00:17:16,951
Shogun forget.

160
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:19,320
Have you had dinner?
No, not yet.

161
00:17:19,387 --> 00:17:23,474
First, I'd like to take
a look at pa's copy
of the full pickering report.

162
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,910
That will only make you sad.

163
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:29,714
Sad? Now, you once told me
all knowledge was good.

164
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:35,019
I don't recall.
Actually, that not
something I would say.

165
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,993
I'll go find pa.

166
00:18:06,651 --> 00:18:09,253
I'm freezing.

167
00:18:09,321 --> 00:18:12,256
Sun's going down.
The desert's
supposed to be hot.

168
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:15,092
Quit bitching. You've
been bitching all day.
I don't like it.

169
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,395
What am I gonna do
with these girls,
mr. Secretary?

170
00:18:17,462 --> 00:18:19,397
First they're hot,
then they're cold.

171
00:18:19,464 --> 00:18:22,099
When she's hot again,
send her over.

172
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:25,636
I'm always hot.

173
00:18:34,329 --> 00:18:36,346
Hello, pa.

174
00:18:38,316 --> 00:18:40,417
Y'all know my son,
nicholas.
Hi, nick.

175
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,420
<i>all grown up, nick.</i>

176
00:18:42,487 --> 00:18:44,956
<i>He ain't a global figure,
like his brother was.
No interest.</i>

177
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:47,408
He's a seafaring man
like yourself, admiral.

178
00:18:47,475 --> 00:18:49,176
Good boy.
Right, nick?

179
00:18:49,244 --> 00:18:51,429
If you say so, pa.

180
00:18:51,496 --> 00:18:54,648
- You didn't tell me you were
leaving the boat, son.
- I had to.

181
00:18:55,517 --> 00:18:58,503
What do you think
these girls are doing
under this blanket, son?

182
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,522
I don't know, pa.

183
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,258
Think they're
playing with my nuts?

184
00:19:04,325 --> 00:19:06,159
you're awful.

185
00:19:06,227 --> 00:19:09,530
I gotta talk to you, pa.

186
00:19:09,614 --> 00:19:11,515
You better believe it, boy.

187
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,599
"clair de lune" ]

188
00:19:47,652 --> 00:19:50,153
Am I disturbing you?

189
00:19:50,221 --> 00:19:52,289
mother, what are
you doing here?

190
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:55,793
Oh, shh! I'm supposed
to be a secret.

191
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,299
I thought you
were in nantucket.

192
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,301
Oh, it was freezing there.

193
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:08,105
And nobody came to visit.
I met this real nice man.

194
00:20:08,172 --> 00:20:11,275
Pa said he just
wanted my money.

195
00:20:11,342 --> 00:20:13,277
So he sent for me.

196
00:20:13,344 --> 00:20:16,346
It's a big secret.
The newspapers, you know.

197
00:20:16,414 --> 00:20:20,083
<i>Oh, nicholas, cocoa's sick.</i>

198
00:20:20,151 --> 00:20:22,720
she's sick.

199
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,755
Aw, let me see.
No, no.

200
00:20:24,823 --> 00:20:27,691
No, she's not well.

201
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,661
Look.

202
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,030
See, she's sick.

203
00:20:33,097 --> 00:20:35,399
Don't be sick on me, honey.
Please don't.

204
00:20:35,466 --> 00:20:37,868
It's just her paw, mom.
She'll be all right.

205
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:41,872
Keith will take her
to the vet tomorrow.
They'll know what to do.

206
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,874
She's never been
like this before.

207
00:20:45,109 --> 00:20:47,044
It frightens me.

208
00:20:47,111 --> 00:20:49,079
You frighten mommy.

209
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,417
I'll speak to keith
before I leave.

210
00:20:53,484 --> 00:20:55,552
He'll take care of it
for you.

211
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,488
You look real handsome.

212
00:20:58,556 --> 00:21:02,726
thank you, mom.

213
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:07,698
Listen, I got a great idea.
Let's have an easter egg hunt
on the lawn.

214
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:11,836
We'll get all dressed up.
Everybody will come.
We'll make it black-tie.

215
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:16,406
Wouldn't that be wonderful
to have a formal easter egg hunt
on the lawn with our friends?

216
00:21:16,474 --> 00:21:18,742
You can stay for that.

217
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:23,781
It's winter.
The middle of winter, mom.

218
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:29,753
But isn't it
a lovely idea?

219
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:33,557
Yes, mom, it is.

220
00:21:43,952 --> 00:21:45,886
C-cocoa's sick.

221
00:21:49,424 --> 00:21:51,024
You didn't tell me
nick was here.

222
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:54,945
- I didn't know
he was coming, emma.
- You're always mad...

223
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:59,450
Just because
nick doesn't wanna be
president like tim did.

224
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:02,286
He's different,
that's all.

225
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:04,722
He's my son
and he's-

226
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:06,724
He's sensitive.

227
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:10,327
Different wives
have different sons.

228
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:13,531
Yes, emma.

229
00:22:27,178 --> 00:22:30,014
Come on, honey.
Let's go up to our room.

230
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,919
I'm flying dr. Marshall
in from washington.

231
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:38,956
He's got some new cure
thinks maybe will help her.
Some kind of vitamins.

232
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,291
- I hope it works.
- It won't.

233
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:45,829
You abandoned my ship.
Pa-

234
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:49,633
I got 60 million bucks floating
there and you take off like
she's Friday night's hooker.

235
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:52,636
- If you'll let me,
I'll tell you why.
- Make it snappy.

236
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,605
I got people outside.
What the hell were you
doing in philly?

237
00:22:55,673 --> 00:22:58,392
- I called you.
You don't take my calls.
- Didn't cerruti tell you?

238
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,679
Cerruti? I gotta hear
from cerruti? What's
he gotta do with this?

239
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:07,017
It concerns tim, pa.

240
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:09,970
Tim?

241
00:23:10,038 --> 00:23:11,605
What about tim?

242
00:23:11,673 --> 00:23:15,443
I was on the teekay
when a man named fletcher
confessed on his deathbed...

243
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,478
That he'd been
one of the two riflemen.

244
00:23:17,546 --> 00:23:20,147
- Bullshit.
- He told us where
he'd hidden the rifle.

245
00:23:20,215 --> 00:23:24,885
And this morning I found it with
miles garner and captain heller
of the philadelphia police.

246
00:23:24,953 --> 00:23:27,521
Where is
this historic weapon?

247
00:23:29,273 --> 00:23:31,008
- I dunno.
- You don't know?

248
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,628
everybody was killed
as we were leaving the building.

249
00:23:34,696 --> 00:23:39,867
I was trying to reach you when
the car was driven away with
their bodies. And the rifle.

250
00:23:39,935 --> 00:23:42,302
And this is the tale
you come home with?

251
00:23:44,439 --> 00:23:47,508
Keifitz heard
the confession on the ship.
An orderly wrote it down.

252
00:23:48,777 --> 00:23:50,711
Wrote it down?

253
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:56,917
Pa?

254
00:23:59,287 --> 00:24:01,088
You all right, pa?

255
00:24:19,156 --> 00:24:21,224
Just wanted
to say good night.

256
00:24:21,292 --> 00:24:24,094
Oh, would you please
have a veterinarian
check out mother's dog?

257
00:24:24,161 --> 00:24:26,396
Something's wrong
with its leg.

258
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:29,299
I'll have it attended to.

259
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:31,301
Don't turn out
the light, please.

260
00:24:31,369 --> 00:24:34,804
All right.
Good night.
Good night.

261
00:24:47,318 --> 00:24:49,252
hope I don't
sound too depressed,

262
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,088
But so much
has been happening
in the past few days.

263
00:24:52,156 --> 00:24:54,991
I got a lot to tell you.
Most of all,

264
00:24:55,059 --> 00:24:59,863
I wanna tell you that
the more I hear your voice,
the more I feel I do love you.

265
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:03,667
Maybe I'll come to new york
and make an honest woman
out of you, huh?

266
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:05,669
Bye-bye.

267
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:07,937
Hello? Hello?

268
00:25:08,005 --> 00:25:09,939
Hello, nick.

269
00:25:24,572 --> 00:25:27,040
Come on, boy.
Wake up.

270
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:29,676
Got to get our ass
in gear.

271
00:25:29,744 --> 00:25:31,678
What time is it?
Time for action.

272
00:25:31,746 --> 00:25:34,447
I've been up all night.
Talked to keifitz in brunei.

273
00:25:34,515 --> 00:25:36,616
Um, looks like
you were telling the truth.

274
00:25:36,684 --> 00:25:38,618
The truth?
Pa, I'm your son.

275
00:25:38,686 --> 00:25:41,438
Yeah, you always had
an excitable imagination.

276
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:46,476
For a while, as a boy,
I was afraid you might
turn out to be a fag.

277
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:48,478
You're a real winner, pa.

278
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:51,081
Keifitz is on his way here
with that killer's confession.

279
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:53,951
Then we go the limit
to bust this thing
wide open.

280
00:25:54,018 --> 00:25:55,953
You're bringing
the confession
to the president?

281
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,589
Hell, no.
That moron can't read
to find the men's room.

282
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:02,760
We gotta picture it for him.
Evidence. Find the rifle.

283
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:06,930
The men behind this fletcher.
And the man behind those men.
Then we go to the president.

284
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:08,915
This is bigger
than we are, pa.

285
00:26:08,983 --> 00:26:11,719
What the president
will do is resurrect
the pickering commission.

286
00:26:11,786 --> 00:26:13,454
Fucking corpses to begin with.

287
00:26:13,522 --> 00:26:15,806
Well, you accepted that
willy arnold acted alone.

288
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:18,058
Sure as hell I did.

289
00:26:18,126 --> 00:26:20,995
If I had pointed a finger
at the russians, the cubans,

290
00:26:21,062 --> 00:26:23,497
Some goddamn hoodlums
or industrialists-

291
00:26:23,564 --> 00:26:26,333
Maybe throw us
in a world war, civil war.

292
00:26:26,401 --> 00:26:29,503
Sure I accepted it.
I got interests in this country.

293
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:31,304
Interests in this country?

294
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:36,209
Yeah, interests. But don't think
I fell for the arnold theory.

295
00:26:36,277 --> 00:26:40,113
I've been a hunter all my life.
I know the best of them.

296
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:43,850
And the best
have trouble with one shot
of the kind that killed tim.

297
00:26:43,918 --> 00:26:47,153
Let alone three.

298
00:26:47,221 --> 00:26:50,323
And then arnold
getting it from joe diamond,
the plump saloon keeper,

299
00:26:50,391 --> 00:26:54,160
While arnold's handcuffed
to detectives surrounded
by 75 rookies.

300
00:26:54,228 --> 00:26:57,464
That's what I mean, pa.
We need help in this.
Help? Like who?

301
00:26:57,532 --> 00:27:01,351
The c.I.A.? They smuggle
my cigars from havana,
that's what they do.

302
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:05,322
Import, export.
And the f.B.I.'s good
for chasing runaways.

303
00:27:05,389 --> 00:27:09,159
Fucking f.B.I. Gave
the commission its information
in the first place, remember?

304
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:12,596
This ain't the forties anymore.
It's a whole new ball game.

305
00:27:12,663 --> 00:27:17,400
We gotta be pioneers, son.
We gotta face that
we're alone in the wilderness.

306
00:27:17,468 --> 00:27:20,303
We got what the pioneers had,
all they had.

307
00:27:20,371 --> 00:27:23,173
- The family.
- The family unit.

308
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:27,144
God blessed you, goddamn it,
with the best of families.

309
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:29,146
My international vice president,
john cerruti,

310
00:27:29,214 --> 00:27:32,316
Has files on the high and mighty
and the low and ornery...

311
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:35,719
That make the c.I.A. Record
look like the corner newsstand.

312
00:27:35,786 --> 00:27:40,424
Information's power. And now
we're gonna use it to get
to the bottom of this thing.

313
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:44,595
Then we go to the president
and congress, as a family unit.

314
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:49,199
And rub their fucking noses
in the dirt that killed my son.

315
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:51,301
Now, get your ass out of bed.

316
00:27:53,288 --> 00:27:57,791
Oh, and by the way,
you won't need the vet.

317
00:27:57,858 --> 00:28:00,994
The vet?
Yeah, the vet for cocoa.

318
00:28:01,062 --> 00:28:04,631
Your mother passed out
last night and smothered
the mutt in her sleep.

319
00:28:04,699 --> 00:28:06,683
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

320
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:11,121
Sleeps with the goddamn dog.
Crazy woman. Now move!

321
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:25,903
I'm sorry, mom.

322
00:29:41,763 --> 00:29:45,098
You stink, pa!
You stink!

323
00:29:50,137 --> 00:29:52,071
Captain heller
died two years ago...

324
00:29:52,139 --> 00:29:54,207
In the virgin islands
of a heart attack.

325
00:29:54,275 --> 00:29:57,744
So miles was either duped
or duped you with a phony.

326
00:29:57,811 --> 00:30:00,380
And your wig-maker friend
jumped out the window.

327
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:04,050
Police say suicide,
'cause vandals
wrecked his business.

328
00:30:04,118 --> 00:30:07,387
Sit down.
No, thanks.

329
00:30:07,455 --> 00:30:10,374
Now, where do we start?

330
00:30:10,441 --> 00:30:12,376
looks like
we've already started.

331
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:14,611
We got three names at the top.

332
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:18,081
Fletcher, casper jr.,
and z.K. Dawson.

333
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:22,652
Dawson's the big one.
One of the richest cocksuckers
in the u.S.A.

334
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,489
Christ. This takes me back.

335
00:30:26,758 --> 00:30:30,260
Yeah, there it is.
Tim and me in the primaries.

336
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:33,046
Dawson was up against us,
pushing us hard.

337
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:36,650
You were just a kid.
Spent a lot of money
in that state.

338
00:30:36,717 --> 00:30:40,687
I mean, over-the-counter,
under-the-table, tucked-into-
a-box-of-cigars money.

339
00:30:40,754 --> 00:30:44,291
Shit, put out 9,700
primary-day workers alone.

340
00:30:44,358 --> 00:30:46,893
Most gorgeous tv commercial
you ever saw.

341
00:30:46,961 --> 00:30:51,665
Tim leading tanks to liberate
the hess sector in germany.
Geez, he looked great.

342
00:30:51,732 --> 00:30:54,534
Ah, made a big noise
in that shitty little state.

343
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:57,537
Got 53 movie stars
to turn out.

344
00:30:57,605 --> 00:31:00,757
And, uh,
all that time and...

345
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:05,028
After and...
Before and during.

346
00:31:05,095 --> 00:31:10,266
Everything I did,
every dime I spent,

347
00:31:10,334 --> 00:31:14,037
Every threat I made,
I was just leading tim
further along the road...

348
00:31:14,105 --> 00:31:16,305
To meet that bullet.

349
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:22,112
- It sounds like that's
just what you were doing, pa.
- What?

350
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,616
Leading tim along.

351
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:29,987
Listen, kid. We find the killers
of your brother and you'll be
a hero like he was.

352
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,989
A fucking legend.

353
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:36,526
- I don't wanna be a legend.
- What the hell do you wanna be,
a goddamned piano player?

354
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,561
maybe, but I'm not very good.

355
00:31:38,629 --> 00:31:42,282
- You stink. You're lousy.
- I know that.

356
00:31:42,349 --> 00:31:45,485
You know that?
You ain't a piano player,
you ain't an artist.

357
00:31:45,553 --> 00:31:48,321
You got no business sense,
no political sense.

358
00:31:48,389 --> 00:31:51,791
What the hell
do you want anyway?
Where are your values in life?

359
00:31:51,859 --> 00:31:54,494
I honestly don't know.

360
00:31:54,562 --> 00:31:57,230
Do you get laid?

361
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:01,835
- I ask you, do you get laid?
- Yeah.

362
00:32:01,903 --> 00:32:04,637
You know how many times
your brother got laid
in office?

363
00:32:04,705 --> 00:32:09,009
<i>- What are you,
the national inquirer?
- One thousand seventy-two.</i>

364
00:32:09,077 --> 00:32:11,011
And with a schedule like his.

365
00:32:11,079 --> 00:32:13,213
Maybe politics
don't turn me on.

366
00:32:13,281 --> 00:32:17,817
Your brother was a giant.
You'll be the same. You watch.

367
00:32:17,885 --> 00:32:21,354
Now, I set up a meeting
with you and z.K. Dawson.

368
00:32:21,422 --> 00:32:24,224
He'll lie of course.
But you'll get something
from the meeting.

369
00:32:24,292 --> 00:32:27,026
- No, pa.
- What?

370
00:32:27,094 --> 00:32:29,596
I said no.

371
00:32:29,663 --> 00:32:32,449
What no? Here's a map
on how to get there.

372
00:32:32,516 --> 00:32:35,919
He's south of tulsa.
It's all arranged. Take it.

373
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:39,857
Take it!

374
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:47,764
- Okay, pa. For the family.
- You bet your ass.

375
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:52,902
Good luck, boy.
I'll be with ya.

376
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,821
<i>I know you will, pa!</i>

377
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,655
Hello.
Good afternoon.
Can I help you?

378
00:33:12,723 --> 00:33:15,391
Yes, I'm here
to see mr. Dawson.
Your name, please.

379
00:33:15,459 --> 00:33:17,443
Nicholas kegan.

380
00:33:19,246 --> 00:33:23,149
You go right ahead.
Z.K.'s on the playing field.
Take the turn to your right...

381
00:33:23,217 --> 00:33:26,119
Before you reach the house
and that's where
you'll find him.

382
00:33:26,187 --> 00:33:28,721
Thank you.

383
00:35:01,398 --> 00:35:04,533
Yeah, I'm z.K. Dawson.
Who the hell are you?

384
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,937
I'm nicholas kegan!

385
00:35:08,823 --> 00:35:11,374
Get out of the vehicle.

386
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,610
I said,
get out of the vehicle.

387
00:35:16,413 --> 00:35:18,347
Uh, speak up.

388
00:35:18,415 --> 00:35:21,584
I'm, uh, nick kegan.
Tom kegan's son.

389
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:26,022
I know that. But what are you
doing here on my playing field,
messing up our games?

390
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:28,241
Oh, the guard said, well-

391
00:35:28,309 --> 00:35:32,045
I don't care what the guard
told you, I wanna know
what you're doing here.

392
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,114
We had an appointment,
mr. Dawson.

393
00:35:34,181 --> 00:35:36,215
I'm aware of that fact.

394
00:35:36,283 --> 00:35:38,618
Now you're wasting my time.

395
00:35:38,686 --> 00:35:42,088
- Well, look here, uh-
- watch your tone.

396
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:45,875
- Mr. Dawson-
- that's better.

397
00:35:48,712 --> 00:35:52,014
Mr. Dawson,
we've discovered a rifle.

398
00:35:52,082 --> 00:35:55,885
We have every reason to believe
it's the weapon that killed
my brother in philadelphia.

399
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:59,572
Your brother was
a miserable, cold-assed,
arrogant son of a bitch.

400
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:03,376
And not a good friend of mine,
as I guess is well known to you.

401
00:36:03,444 --> 00:36:05,912
Yes, I'm aware of that.

402
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:10,550
But the assassin was hired
by a man named casper jr.

403
00:36:10,617 --> 00:36:13,719
And as you know everyone
of importance in the area,
we thought-

404
00:36:13,787 --> 00:36:17,974
What I ought to do
is run right over you,
flatten you like a waffle.

405
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:21,110
Sir?
I know
why you're here.

406
00:36:21,178 --> 00:36:25,265
You're here because you think
I had some part of a conspiracy
killed your brother.

407
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:28,484
You and all the other
conspiracy lovers in this
conspiracy-loving country.

408
00:36:28,552 --> 00:36:30,386
Actually, mr. Dawson-

409
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:34,307
Why should I kill your brother
when I'm getting rich off him?

410
00:36:34,374 --> 00:36:37,143
Off his military spendin',
his space spendin'.

411
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:40,613
His tax reduction
a-and h-his crisis spendin'.

412
00:36:40,681 --> 00:36:45,084
Hell, you know if your old man
didn't own him already,
I might have bought him myself.

413
00:36:45,152 --> 00:36:47,754
Except for
his snotty personality.

414
00:36:47,822 --> 00:36:50,840
I didn't come here
to listen to slander,
mr. Dawson.

415
00:36:50,908 --> 00:36:53,876
slander?

416
00:36:53,944 --> 00:36:55,745
You think before you speak,
young man.

417
00:36:55,813 --> 00:37:00,667
Hell, they didn't
teach you kids nothing
since 1944.

418
00:37:00,734 --> 00:37:03,436
Hey, I didn't kill your brother.

419
00:37:03,504 --> 00:37:07,791
That's a vile, cruel,
mythological invention.

420
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:11,160
But it is also a-
an infectious invention.

421
00:37:11,228 --> 00:37:14,831
And when it reached the ears
of my daughter, I thought,
maybe I'll make...

422
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:18,267
A couple of phone calls
and really find out
who did the deed.

423
00:37:18,335 --> 00:37:20,804
Who might that be?

424
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:23,539
The philadelphia police
killed your brother.

425
00:37:23,607 --> 00:37:26,476
The man in charge
of the operation
was a captain heller.

426
00:37:26,543 --> 00:37:30,480
So if I was you,
I'd just go and have
a talk with that man.

427
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:33,983
- Uh, he's dead.
- Well, then I'd track down
a sidekick of his.

428
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:36,219
A man named ray doty.

429
00:37:41,441 --> 00:37:43,743
Thank you.
Yeah, well,
you're welcome.

430
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,811
Now, I'm gonna
tell you one more thing.

431
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:48,882
I'm gonna give you
a head start of 30 seconds.

432
00:37:48,949 --> 00:37:52,485
And then me and my boys here,
we're coming after you.

433
00:37:52,553 --> 00:37:54,487
Sir?
You heard me.

434
00:37:54,555 --> 00:37:57,257
We still got some
private property
in this country.

435
00:37:57,324 --> 00:38:01,727
Ten... Nine... Eight... Seven...

436
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:58,635
I'm looking for a passenger
named nicholas kegan.

437
00:39:08,379 --> 00:39:10,346
Mr. Kegan?
Yes?

438
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:13,750
Telephone call for you.
Please hurry.
We're beginning our descent.

439
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:20,256
You have a telephone call
for me here?
Please.

440
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:29,131
I have a telephone call
up here.

441
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:31,334
where the hell is he?

442
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:34,837
Pa?
You didn't call me
when you left dawson.

443
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:38,908
Pa, there are hundreds
of people on board.
Uh, we're about to land.

444
00:39:38,975 --> 00:39:42,762
Maybe, but I'm still
losing money on this airline.
Now, what'd dawson say?

445
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:45,147
He says it's heller
in the philadelphia police.

446
00:39:45,215 --> 00:39:49,452
Says I should talk to a cop
named ray doty. He also
fired on my car with tanks.

447
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,789
The old coot.
Ray doty. I'll arrange it.
That why you going to new york?

448
00:39:53,857 --> 00:39:56,692
come on. Come on.
No, I'm gonna see my girl.

449
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,728
Girl? What girl?
Just a girl, pa.
Look, I gotta go.

450
00:39:59,796 --> 00:40:04,066
Forget the girl.
You go see doty.
By the way, keifitz is dead.

451
00:40:04,134 --> 00:40:07,403
Keifitz?
Died in brunei.

452
00:40:07,471 --> 00:40:11,874
Keifitz?
What about the confession?

453
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:15,844
Orderly's dead too. Fell off
the toilet and broke his neck.
What?

454
00:40:15,879 --> 00:40:20,233
4-14, 4-14, where are you?
4-14 approaching runway 6.

455
00:40:34,081 --> 00:40:36,416
It's safe to talk in here.

456
00:40:39,486 --> 00:40:41,620
These lights
stay on all the time?

457
00:40:41,688 --> 00:40:44,890
Day and night.
All year round.

458
00:40:44,958 --> 00:40:48,594
They never know
what time it is.
Just keep laying those eggs.

459
00:40:48,662 --> 00:40:52,065
And they never hatch.
Never do.

460
00:40:52,132 --> 00:40:56,969
Give 'em hormones, of course.
And amphetamines.
Keeps 'em going.

461
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:59,439
They're all on speed.

462
00:40:59,506 --> 00:41:01,774
Jittery as hell.

463
00:41:01,842 --> 00:41:05,111
My father's information
agency has paid you.
Is this, uh-

464
00:41:05,179 --> 00:41:08,781
I took the cash.
Just like in the old days.

465
00:41:08,849 --> 00:41:11,251
Once a cop,
always a cop.

466
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:17,590
Wish I was back
on the force sometimes.

467
00:41:17,657 --> 00:41:20,893
So how did, uh,
casper jr. Get to you?

468
00:41:20,961 --> 00:41:24,663
Oh, he didn't get to us.
He got to joe diamond.

469
00:41:24,731 --> 00:41:26,699
¶

470
00:41:26,767 --> 00:41:30,536
You do that very well.
I think-

471
00:41:30,604 --> 00:41:32,538
now you gotta understand...

472
00:41:32,606 --> 00:41:35,775
That joe diamond
was a notorious cop lover.

473
00:41:35,842 --> 00:41:39,445
<i>I mean, a real cop lover.</i>

474
00:41:39,513 --> 00:41:41,614
He always kept this nightclub
full of rookies.

475
00:41:41,681 --> 00:41:44,550
Drinking beer, getting high.

476
00:41:44,618 --> 00:41:46,952
<i>Anyway,
the meeting was set up...</i>

477
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,088
Between diamond
and an old pal of his.

478
00:41:49,156 --> 00:41:51,090
It took place in tucson.

479
00:42:09,626 --> 00:42:11,994
How you been, gameboy?

480
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:17,132
Oh, older and fatter.
Uglier. Like you.

481
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:21,587
I don't know.

482
00:42:21,655 --> 00:42:24,823
- Did you eat?
- Yeah.

483
00:42:24,891 --> 00:42:27,760
What'd you eat?

484
00:42:27,827 --> 00:42:30,530
Pastrami on whole wheat
with celery tonic.

485
00:42:30,597 --> 00:42:33,966
Any good?

486
00:42:34,034 --> 00:42:36,369
Lousy.
Tucson.

487
00:42:36,436 --> 00:42:40,889
Don't ever order the
wild west pastrami.
Sit down.

488
00:42:46,563 --> 00:42:51,367
it's like old times.

489
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:53,969
Y-you remember us
in atlantic city?

490
00:42:54,037 --> 00:42:57,072
Maybe. Maybe not.

491
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:59,074
But I got
a contract for you.

492
00:42:59,142 --> 00:43:03,246
One of the biggest contracts
ever handed out anywheres.

493
00:43:03,314 --> 00:43:06,032
Me? I-I'm a restaurant man.

494
00:43:06,099 --> 00:43:09,235
You're also a thief
who is crazy enough to steal...

495
00:43:09,303 --> 00:43:12,571
From moey and sam
and morris and uncle louie.

496
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:15,074
I wanna pay back.

497
00:43:15,142 --> 00:43:17,143
you are fucking right.

498
00:43:18,245 --> 00:43:20,179
I-I can pay back?

499
00:43:20,247 --> 00:43:22,915
When you handle this hit,
you'll be paying back.

500
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:25,368
A hit?

501
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:30,840
Why me? There must be 200
mechanics around here can
make any hit better than me.

502
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:35,344
I told 'em. No good.
Those guys aren't political.

503
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:37,813
I'm political?

504
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:41,901
You were in cuba.
Very good friends
with a certain minister.

505
00:43:41,969 --> 00:43:45,421
I thought about you a lot,
gameboy.

506
00:43:45,756 --> 00:43:48,791
You have a commie background
in the f.B.I. Files.

507
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:52,595
Commie? I was out of cuba
ten years before castro.

508
00:43:52,662 --> 00:43:57,367
Joe, what do you
want from me?
You were in cuba.

509
00:43:57,434 --> 00:44:00,603
This is crazy.
Anyways,
youse gotta make the hit.

510
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,774
- Who's the contract?
- There are two.

511
00:44:05,842 --> 00:44:07,943
We've already taken care
of the first one.

512
00:44:08,011 --> 00:44:11,113
You make the second hit.
A kid named willie arnold.

513
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:13,616
I don't know him.

514
00:44:13,683 --> 00:44:15,618
A-and who's the first?

515
00:44:15,685 --> 00:44:18,221
President kegan.

516
00:44:29,115 --> 00:44:33,352
so diamond went back to philly
to get ahold of captain heller.

517
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,121
Heller was my superior officer
at the time.

518
00:44:36,189 --> 00:44:38,958
He was a great family man.

519
00:44:39,025 --> 00:44:42,462
Seven daughters
and a big house.

520
00:44:42,529 --> 00:44:44,664
Daughters are expensive.

521
00:44:46,467 --> 00:44:49,469
¶

522
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:07,002
After the assignation,
diamond's job was
to shoot the phony assassin,

523
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:09,471
Willie arnold,
in the police station.

524
00:45:09,539 --> 00:45:13,843
Heller was paid to get an in.

525
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:17,079
Heller was terrific
at organization.

526
00:45:17,146 --> 00:45:19,815
Our last meeting took place
right here at this farm.

527
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:23,151
Here's two sets of keys
to the engleson building.

528
00:45:23,219 --> 00:45:26,654
Get them to the texan
when he arrives tomorrow.
Right, captain.

529
00:45:26,689 --> 00:45:30,877
Willie arnold should be
planted in the tv center
warehouse by half past 9:00.

530
00:45:30,944 --> 00:45:33,045
The motorcade will pass
towards city hall at 12:30.

531
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:38,100
Ray will give you your rifle
and some shells to have arnold
throw on the floor as evidence.

532
00:45:38,168 --> 00:45:43,038
Tell willie arnold to go home
after the real hit. If we need
him, we'll send a patrol car.

533
00:45:43,106 --> 00:45:45,841
Ray will give you
the rest of the details.

534
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:50,113
And when we arrest arnold
after the hit, you know
what you have to do. Right, joe?

535
00:45:52,415 --> 00:45:54,349
Yeah, I know.

536
00:45:54,417 --> 00:45:58,420
There are a lot of things
we gotta consider here.

537
00:45:58,488 --> 00:46:01,023
All right, cut it out,
will you? Come on.

538
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,861
how did they find diamond?

539
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,896
<i>Who?
Casper jr.
And his people.</i>

540
00:46:06,963 --> 00:46:09,098
Figures to me
the mob found him.

541
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:13,068
Diamond was with the boys
in cleveland, chicago, detroit.

542
00:46:13,136 --> 00:46:16,739
Why would the mob wanna
kill the president?
Business reasons.

543
00:46:16,807 --> 00:46:20,443
Heard a very big man
in the syndicate
say one day that...

544
00:46:20,511 --> 00:46:25,247
Kegan took $2 million
in campaign contributions
from the boys and then...

545
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:27,249
Didn't do anything
about it.

546
00:46:27,317 --> 00:46:32,121
Nonsense. Tim didn't
need the money.

547
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:34,457
Who knows.

548
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:37,860
Anyway,
whoever did it still has
a terrific amount of clout...

549
00:46:37,928 --> 00:46:39,862
19 years
after it happened.

550
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:43,232
Yeah.

551
00:46:57,731 --> 00:47:00,399
Hello?
you're home!

552
00:47:00,466 --> 00:47:02,468
Nick?
Oh, wonderful.

553
00:47:03,069 --> 00:47:05,454
<i>I've been trying
to reach you for days.</i>

554
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:08,023
Where are you?
Grand central.
I'm, uh-

555
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:10,859
I'm on my way over, okay?
Okay. I can't wait.

556
00:47:10,927 --> 00:47:12,861
yvette-

557
00:47:12,929 --> 00:47:16,065
Oh, I got something to tell you.
I can't believe you're real!

558
00:47:16,132 --> 00:47:20,469
Yeah, well, I'm not real.
I'm just a more complicated
new machine.

559
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:22,672
You're what?

560
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:26,141
You come on over
and see what this
new machine can do.

561
00:47:26,209 --> 00:47:29,612
I'm on my way.
I can't wait.

562
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,815
I love you.
Then come and get me.

563
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,388
<i>oh, shh! Somebody's
gonna call the police!</i>

564
00:47:42,075 --> 00:47:44,510
Shh. Shh.

565
00:47:44,578 --> 00:47:47,513
Shh!

566
00:47:47,581 --> 00:47:49,848
Marry me.
Marry me!

567
00:47:54,654 --> 00:47:56,956
Shh. Shh. Shh.

568
00:47:59,492 --> 00:48:02,661
Oh, marry me.
Marry me!

569
00:48:04,030 --> 00:48:08,000
Yes! Yes! Oh, god, yes!

570
00:48:09,419 --> 00:48:11,353
Oh, you make me so happy.

571
00:48:14,491 --> 00:48:17,926
Shh. Come on.
Somebody's gonna
call the police.

572
00:48:17,994 --> 00:48:20,162
Shh.

573
00:48:44,137 --> 00:48:47,139
hi.
Hi.

574
00:48:52,879 --> 00:48:57,116
- When should we do it?
- Let me rest a minute first.

575
00:48:59,535 --> 00:49:01,470
No, I mean get married.

576
00:49:01,537 --> 00:49:05,074
Get married?
You just said yes.

577
00:49:05,141 --> 00:49:08,543
Oh, I always say yes
at those times.

578
00:49:08,611 --> 00:49:11,213
You know I can't marry you.

579
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,215
What?

580
00:49:13,282 --> 00:49:15,784
Come on. Up.

581
00:49:22,826 --> 00:49:24,760
Ah, be right back.

582
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:27,529
- Why won't you marry me?
- You hardly know me.

583
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:31,733
We see each other.
I talk to you all the time.
You talk to my machine.

584
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:36,956
<i>- Oh, so what.
I can tell the difference.
- That's a beginning.</i>

585
00:49:36,991 --> 00:49:40,743
I'm making an honest
proposal of marriage.

586
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:43,028
Tell you what.

587
00:49:43,096 --> 00:49:46,665
I'll give you a copy
of my answering machine tape.
You can take it with you.

588
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:49,101
Come on.
Don't toy with me.

589
00:49:49,169 --> 00:49:52,738
I'm serious.

590
00:49:52,805 --> 00:49:55,241
We'll have this huge wedding
in saint patrick's cathedral.

591
00:49:55,308 --> 00:49:58,978
Saint patrick's?
What if I'm jewish?

592
00:49:59,045 --> 00:50:01,780
That doesn't matter.
Pa knows the cardinal.

593
00:50:01,848 --> 00:50:04,216
You see, darling.
You know nothing about me.

594
00:50:05,802 --> 00:50:07,737
I know all I need to know.

595
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:11,307
<i>You know what?
That you're in love
with my answering machine.</i>

596
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:13,576
Well, I'll know you
better later on.

597
00:50:15,662 --> 00:50:18,263
Do you know
what I do for a living?

598
00:50:18,331 --> 00:50:22,668
- That doesn't matter. You will
never have to work again.
- But I wanna work.

599
00:50:22,736 --> 00:50:24,937
<i>I'm assistant editor
at national magazine.</i>

600
00:50:25,005 --> 00:50:28,007
Maybe pa owns it.
Do you want a promotion?

601
00:50:28,074 --> 00:50:30,843
I want my own life
too, nick.

602
00:50:30,911 --> 00:50:34,046
- Well, I'll buy you
whatever you want.
- No.

603
00:50:35,649 --> 00:50:37,650
You just said no.
I said no.

604
00:50:39,585 --> 00:50:41,820
How can you say
a thing like that?

605
00:50:41,888 --> 00:50:43,822
Why complicate things?

606
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:47,793
We have great sex, freedom,
no kids, no responsibilities.

607
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:50,296
Why duplicate
the messes others make?

608
00:50:50,363 --> 00:50:54,266
- But we don't have to.
- We can make a mess
of our own?

609
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:58,170
- Who knows what will happen?
- Don't ask me anymore, nick.

610
00:50:58,237 --> 00:51:02,507
I adore you. I really do.
But the answer's
gonna stay the same.

611
00:51:02,575 --> 00:51:06,912
I'd tell you why
if I could but I can't.

612
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:09,982
Don't say you can't.
Say you don't want.

613
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:14,152
I don't want.

614
00:51:16,456 --> 00:51:19,992
Then forget it.
All right.

615
00:51:24,631 --> 00:51:27,700
I think
I'd better leave.
If you want to.

616
00:51:27,767 --> 00:51:31,336
I have a friend coming over
if you'd like to meet her.

617
00:51:31,404 --> 00:51:34,740
A friend? Who?
Patty. She's from
the magazine. You'd dig her.

618
00:51:34,807 --> 00:51:38,494
- Dig her? What does that mean?
- Whatever you want it to mean.

619
00:51:38,561 --> 00:51:40,496
God, you're just
like the others.

620
00:51:40,563 --> 00:51:44,399
Others?
How many are there?

621
00:51:44,467 --> 00:51:46,836
Fewer and fewer.

622
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:51,040
Oh, I get it.
You're into women.

623
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:55,011
- I am a woman.
- You know what
I'm talking about.

624
00:51:55,078 --> 00:51:58,580
Nope. And I won't marry
a person I can't understand.

625
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:03,185
Good night.

626
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:08,223
Call the machine
whenever you want, darling.
It only goes one way.

627
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:19,468
Mr. Wilson?
Good evening.

628
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:21,803
Mr. Kegan. This is
a pleasant surprise.

629
00:52:21,871 --> 00:52:24,340
Can I have my key,
please?
Certainly.

630
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:28,743
My, you're looking...
Worse than I've
ever seen you, sir.

631
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:33,715
I've been traveling.
It certainly doesn't
agree with you.

632
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:35,717
Good night.
Good night.

633
00:52:35,785 --> 00:52:39,288
I'll alert the staff
that you're in residence.
And get some sleep.

634
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:45,894
Welcome home, nick.
It's good to see you.

635
00:52:45,962 --> 00:52:49,865
Good to see you too,
raymond.

636
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:53,468
The maid is freshening
your room, sir.

637
00:52:53,536 --> 00:52:56,137
Get me a double,
please, raymond.

638
00:52:56,205 --> 00:52:58,139
A double what, sir?

639
00:52:59,943 --> 00:53:02,344
Uh, on second thought,
make it triple.

640
00:53:02,411 --> 00:53:04,947
A triple what, sir?

641
00:53:30,056 --> 00:53:34,493
Hello.
This is yvette malone speaking.
I'm not home just now.

642
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:37,930
I hate this machine!
Leave your name
and telephone number,

643
00:53:37,998 --> 00:53:42,168
I'll call you when I return.
Please begin at the tone.

644
00:53:43,703 --> 00:53:46,238
Hello, yvette, listen,
I'm sorry I was so, uh, rude.

645
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:49,474
I didn't, you know,
listen to you or anything.

646
00:53:49,542 --> 00:53:53,879
I want you to know
that I still care about you
and I wanna see you.

647
00:53:53,947 --> 00:53:56,982
Why don't we have lunch tomorrow
at the lorraine, huh? 12:30.

648
00:54:00,687 --> 00:54:02,621
Nicholas?

649
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:33,836
Help! Help! Help!

650
00:54:33,903 --> 00:54:36,071
Raymond!

651
00:54:36,138 --> 00:54:39,207
I brought your drink, sir.

652
00:54:49,586 --> 00:54:53,855
Hello. This is nick kegan.
A maid just left my room.
Have security stop her, please.

653
00:54:53,923 --> 00:54:55,924
She tried to kill me.

654
00:55:15,761 --> 00:55:17,696
Sorry I'm late.

655
00:55:19,832 --> 00:55:24,102
I'm glad you came.
Well, me too. I hate saying
good-bye to a naked man.

656
00:55:28,441 --> 00:55:30,109
Excuse me.

657
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:38,133
Yes, sir.
Can I help you?
We'd like a table, please.

658
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:41,270
For the two of you?
Yeah, someplace we can talk.

659
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:46,225
Well, I'm sorry, sir.
We don't allow ladies
in trousers in the dining area.

660
00:55:46,292 --> 00:55:49,628
You what?
Uh, it's no problem.

661
00:55:49,695 --> 00:55:51,763
You know what happened
to me this morning?

662
00:55:51,831 --> 00:55:55,000
I go out of the taxi,
and the cabdriver followed
me on the sidewalk,

663
00:55:55,067 --> 00:55:58,987
Swearing at me because
he didn't think
I tipped him enough.

664
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:02,757
<i>Madam, we will
have to ask you to leave.</i>

665
00:56:02,825 --> 00:56:05,460
We're staying, my friend.
She's got you.

666
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:08,230
impossible.

667
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,436
My name is nicholas kegan.
My father owns this place.

668
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:18,190
Oh, I'm awfully sorry, sir.

669
00:56:18,791 --> 00:56:22,444
I didn't recognize you.
Please, right this way.

670
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:24,513
Right this way.
Thank you.

671
00:56:35,157 --> 00:56:38,927
Listen, I'm, uh-
I'm sorry about last night.
No, I'm sorry.

672
00:56:38,994 --> 00:56:42,764
I got about six different
kinds of jet lag.
No, I understand.

673
00:56:42,831 --> 00:56:45,534
Tell me, where were you
one week ago today?

674
00:56:45,601 --> 00:56:48,603
Uh, brisbane, australia.

675
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:50,605
Oh, brisbane.

676
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:52,808
The coral sea, stonefish,

677
00:56:52,875 --> 00:56:55,911
Captain cook
sweeping north through
that treacherous channel.

678
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:00,582
Oh, that's beautiful.

679
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:04,219
Yeah. Look, yvette-

680
00:57:04,287 --> 00:57:08,223
I still wanna marry you.

681
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:10,426
Is that why this lunch?

682
00:57:10,493 --> 00:57:12,494
No.

683
00:57:12,562 --> 00:57:14,863
I need
your magazine's help.

684
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:16,865
Maybe
it's your magazine.

685
00:57:19,302 --> 00:57:22,671
I need to contact
someone in the mob-
someone big.

686
00:57:22,738 --> 00:57:24,939
What for?
It is not to be
talked about.

687
00:57:25,007 --> 00:57:26,941
I cross my heart.

688
00:57:27,009 --> 00:57:30,078
<i>I also need everything
in your files on joe diamond.
Joe diamond?</i>

689
00:57:30,145 --> 00:57:32,681
Who he knew in the mob.
Who knew him.

690
00:57:32,748 --> 00:57:35,750
What for? Does it
concern your brother?

691
00:57:35,818 --> 00:57:40,355
We have reason to believe
that we're on the track
of uncovering a conspiracy.

692
00:57:40,423 --> 00:57:43,024
A conspiracy?

693
00:57:44,827 --> 00:57:48,096
Three days ago,

694
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:51,733
I met the true assassin
of my brother.

695
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:56,872
Is this on the level?
Now I want to find out
who actually hired diamond.

696
00:57:56,939 --> 00:58:00,042
Not the go-between.
I wanna find the man
who is responsible for this.

697
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:03,462
Well, sure.
It'll cost.

698
00:58:03,529 --> 00:58:06,798
It cost to have
my brother killed. I think
we can pay whatever it cost...

699
00:58:06,866 --> 00:58:11,336
To find those who-
who did it to him.

700
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:14,239
And I don't want
any press until I say so.

701
00:58:14,306 --> 00:58:16,241
Are you offering us
the exclusive?

702
00:58:18,344 --> 00:58:20,278
Thank you.

703
00:58:20,346 --> 00:58:22,748
If you come up
with the contacts.

704
00:58:22,815 --> 00:58:25,383
Wow. This is big.

705
00:58:25,451 --> 00:58:29,020
I mean, really big.
Hey, wow!

706
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:31,740
you know,

707
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:34,275
When I'm with you, the-

708
00:58:34,343 --> 00:58:36,928
- Wow!
- Yvette?

709
00:58:36,996 --> 00:58:39,064
Yvette-

710
00:58:39,132 --> 00:58:42,700
You know, tim-

711
00:58:42,768 --> 00:58:44,936
He had thousands of women,
and I've, uh-

712
00:58:45,004 --> 00:58:46,938
I've actually
only had twelve.

713
00:58:47,006 --> 00:58:51,143
And I know that may
seem conservative to you.

714
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:54,379
Oh, listen, honey.
You get me this story,
I'll get you all you want.

715
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:57,265
Are you listening to me?

716
00:58:57,333 --> 00:59:02,654
I sure am.
And if you want this story,
I gotta get my tail in gear.

717
00:59:02,721 --> 00:59:05,157
I call you
from the magazine.
Thanks for lunch.

718
00:59:05,224 --> 00:59:07,992
Lunch?
This news makes my day.
It's wonderful.

719
00:59:09,128 --> 00:59:11,062
Excuse me.

720
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:19,454
What the hell were you
doing with that broad
at lunch today?

721
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:22,691
She's a friend of mine.
Are you screwing her?

722
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:27,629
Oh, I forgot.
You're the boy scout
of the family.

723
00:59:27,697 --> 00:59:29,948
Tim always shared
information
on his broads.

724
00:59:30,016 --> 00:59:33,951
<i>I'm not tim.
Where'd you meet her?</i>

725
00:59:34,019 --> 00:59:35,987
Keifitz introduced us
in paris one weekend.

726
00:59:36,055 --> 00:59:38,390
She's the press.
I said no press.

727
00:59:38,457 --> 00:59:41,143
I need contacts
with the mob.

728
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:44,713
I'm in business,
for christ's sake. Been dealing
with the mob for years.

729
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:48,683
But you go to some dame
you got the hots for
and spill everything.

730
00:59:48,718 --> 00:59:51,803
<i>That's wrong.
Like hell.</i>

731
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:54,673
Cerruti played the whole lunch
to me ten minutes ago.

732
00:59:56,108 --> 00:59:58,209
- You had us bugged?
- It's my restaurant, son.

733
00:59:58,277 --> 01:00:01,145
A lot of people
more important than you
make deals there.

734
01:00:01,213 --> 01:00:03,415
<i>Of course
I have it bugged.</i>

735
01:00:03,482 --> 01:00:05,917
Telephone for you,
sir.

736
01:00:05,984 --> 01:00:08,920
I'll take it in my room.
Take it here.

737
01:00:08,987 --> 01:00:11,155
Cerruti's
recording it
anyhow.

738
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:15,594
Hello.

739
01:00:15,661 --> 01:00:18,363
Hello, yvette.

740
01:00:18,431 --> 01:00:20,365
You what?
Already?

741
01:00:20,433 --> 01:00:22,767
Yeah, you sure do.

742
01:00:22,835 --> 01:00:24,936
how much?

743
01:00:26,171 --> 01:00:29,040
Who is it?

744
01:00:29,108 --> 01:00:31,443
Uh-huh.
Cleveland.

745
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:33,511
All right.
I'll catch the next plane.

746
01:00:33,579 --> 01:00:35,647
And thanks.

747
01:00:37,850 --> 01:00:40,852
Who are you meeting?
Someone named
irving mentor.

748
01:00:40,919 --> 01:00:43,788
Yvette says
he's the magazine's
direct line to the mob.

749
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:48,960
I'll check on him.
I got something for you.

750
01:00:49,028 --> 01:00:53,765
Whatcha scared of?
I don't want you in any more
situations you can't handle.

751
01:00:53,832 --> 01:00:56,384
- I don't want a gun.
- Look,

752
01:00:56,452 --> 01:00:58,653
Somebody tried
to kill you last night.

753
01:00:58,721 --> 01:01:00,655
This ain't
no treasure hunt
you're on.

754
01:01:00,723 --> 01:01:03,625
Pa, I'm not
gonna carry a gun.

755
01:01:03,692 --> 01:01:06,394
I admire the way
you fought off
that killer, boy.

756
01:01:06,462 --> 01:01:09,097
Single-handedly.
It was only the maid.

757
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:12,250
Ah, trained killer.
We got her, by the way.
We got her?

758
01:01:12,318 --> 01:01:14,252
Yeah.
Working her over now.

759
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:16,822
My people are on this
all the way.

760
01:01:16,889 --> 01:01:19,825
All right. If you won't
carry a gun, take this.

761
01:01:22,044 --> 01:01:24,846
For my peace of mind
if nothing else.

762
01:01:25,882 --> 01:01:27,816
You're amazing.

763
01:01:27,884 --> 01:01:30,685
Take these, uh,
brass knuckles too.

764
01:01:30,753 --> 01:01:34,455
Uh, don't lose them.
They have
a sentimental value.

765
01:01:35,725 --> 01:01:38,459
Thanks.

766
01:01:38,527 --> 01:01:42,330
Uh, I'll see you
in cleveland.
I'll be in the hospital.

767
01:01:42,398 --> 01:01:45,100
Oh, nothing's wrong.
Six-months' blood change is all.

768
01:01:45,167 --> 01:01:47,268
- Blood change?
- Yeah.

769
01:01:47,336 --> 01:01:50,972
I take it from the kids
at amherst. Got a deal
with the red cross.

770
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,207
Uh, for the circulation.

771
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:56,644
I'll see you, pa.

772
01:01:56,712 --> 01:01:58,646
<i>Call me from cleveland.</i>

773
01:02:14,113 --> 01:02:16,114
I'm looking
for irving mentor.

774
01:02:16,182 --> 01:02:18,216
Never heard of him.

775
01:02:19,552 --> 01:02:21,720
Uh, my name
is nick kegan.

776
01:02:59,325 --> 01:03:01,326
I bought you
coffee.

777
01:03:02,762 --> 01:03:04,830
Cream?
No, thanks.

778
01:03:05,832 --> 01:03:07,833
You got the cash?

779
01:03:13,506 --> 01:03:16,007
Better count it.
Humph.
You bet your ass.

780
01:03:29,205 --> 01:03:31,305
Okay.

781
01:03:35,711 --> 01:03:38,847
The contract for the hit
came from gameboy baker.

782
01:03:40,332 --> 01:03:43,751
- Gameboy baker.
- You got it.

783
01:03:43,819 --> 01:03:46,488
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait a minute.
Sorry.

784
01:03:46,556 --> 01:03:48,423
This ain't
a social visit.
Oh, yeah?

785
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:52,143
It's not worth 15 grand,
either. Now sit down.

786
01:03:52,211 --> 01:03:54,713
Sit down
or give me my money back.

787
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:57,982
Watch your language.
These are my boys, you know.

788
01:03:58,050 --> 01:04:00,569
<i>get out of here.</i>

789
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:10,311
Tell me about this, uh,
gameboy baker.

790
01:04:12,748 --> 01:04:15,250
Joe diamond is from
the old neighborhood.

791
01:04:17,086 --> 01:04:19,387
Small-time thief.
No sense.

792
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:22,857
¶

793
01:04:22,925 --> 01:04:24,859
it was gameboy baker...

794
01:04:24,927 --> 01:04:27,195
Who helped set joe up
in his nightclub.

795
01:04:27,262 --> 01:04:31,800
Only joe wasn't paying back.
He was too busy supporting
some of the local rookies.

796
01:04:31,867 --> 01:04:34,436
I was the one
who delivered the message.

797
01:04:34,503 --> 01:04:38,272
That moey and sam
and morris and uncle louie
wanted a conversation with him.

798
01:04:40,342 --> 01:04:42,844
so joe skipped to cuba.

799
01:04:42,911 --> 01:04:45,113
And by the time
the boys found him,

800
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:48,282
He was in bed
with every faigelah
politician in havana.

801
01:04:50,453 --> 01:04:53,388
joe took protection
from his cuban friend...

802
01:04:53,456 --> 01:04:55,890
And went back
to his club in philly.

803
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:57,992
But he still owed the boys
an obligation,

804
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:01,095
Which he paid back on that day
he shot willy arnold.

805
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:07,385
Open that door.
The smoke's
getting to me.

806
01:05:07,453 --> 01:05:10,388
That could be a signal
or something.

807
01:05:10,456 --> 01:05:14,125
Open the door
or I'll shove the cigar
down your throat.

808
01:05:15,227 --> 01:05:17,395
Eighty-five cents,
wholesale.

809
01:05:17,463 --> 01:05:20,264
Now, who is casper jr.?
A hollywood agent.

810
01:05:21,634 --> 01:05:25,636
What?
Deals for harry small,
head of federal studios.

811
01:05:27,823 --> 01:05:30,925
Why would people like that
wanna kill a president?

812
01:05:30,993 --> 01:05:34,595
That particular president
cost that studio...

813
01:05:34,663 --> 01:05:37,432
$50 million...

814
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:41,336
When he stopped
screwing ellamae irving
and she killed herself.

815
01:05:41,404 --> 01:05:45,006
I give you $15,000
and you tell me gossip.

816
01:05:45,074 --> 01:05:47,942
Where there's smoke,
there's fire.

817
01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:50,512
What can I tell you?

818
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:54,782
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
Just a moment.

819
01:05:54,850 --> 01:05:57,769
What the hell?

820
01:06:03,592 --> 01:06:07,862
What are you feeding us?
The cat's dead. What is this?

821
01:06:48,053 --> 01:06:52,056
calling dr. Rogers.
Telephone call, dr. Rogers.

822
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:10,007
My father's
a patient here.

823
01:07:10,075 --> 01:07:12,343
Your name?

824
01:07:12,411 --> 01:07:14,579
Nicholas kegan.

825
01:07:16,915 --> 01:07:18,916
<i>Thank you, doctor.</i>

826
01:07:22,021 --> 01:07:25,640
Federal studios? Hell,
you couldn't spot a nigger
in a snowbank.

827
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:29,443
I'm telling you what he said.
I got interlocking companies
controlling federal.

828
01:07:29,511 --> 01:07:33,615
Her last two pictures
lost money. Harry small was glad
to get out of her contract.

829
01:07:33,682 --> 01:07:35,450
<i>You gotta stop
chasing mare tails, boy.</i>

830
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:38,202
I fixed up
a meeting for you
with frank mayo.

831
01:07:38,270 --> 01:07:40,872
- Mayo?
- Heard of him, huh?

832
01:07:40,939 --> 01:07:43,207
Grand vizier
of the underworld.

833
01:07:43,275 --> 01:07:45,776
I thought he was in jail.
Upstate,
maximum security.

834
01:07:45,844 --> 01:07:48,179
I got him out
to meet you
this afternoon.

835
01:07:48,247 --> 01:07:50,514
What can he tell me
that mentor didn't know?

836
01:07:50,582 --> 01:07:54,485
What did mentor know? Nothing.
You tell that broad of yours
she owes you 15 grand.

837
01:07:54,553 --> 01:07:57,705
- Have a pastry?
- Think that sugar's
good for you?

838
01:07:57,773 --> 01:08:00,892
It's my hospital.

839
01:08:00,959 --> 01:08:04,562
Own what you use.
Nothing competes today
with owning a hospital.

840
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:08,850
No customer credit.
Pay in advance or get out.
Unique product- pain.

841
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:13,504
Laundry alone throws off enough
to pay the orderlies and lab.
And what the lab turns over-

842
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:17,091
- When is the meeting with mayo?
- I'm talking business here.

843
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:19,928
You should see the net
on what the lab throws off.

844
01:08:19,995 --> 01:08:23,030
I own 27 hospitals
in 15 major cities.
Wish I had more.

845
01:08:23,098 --> 01:08:25,416
Where is the meeting
with frank mayo, pa?

846
01:08:25,483 --> 01:08:28,752
Grant's tomb, 4:00.

847
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:30,754
<i>Hey, nick.</i>

848
01:08:31,756 --> 01:08:34,058
Uh, would you
like a little?

849
01:08:40,999 --> 01:08:43,184
No, thanks, pa.

850
01:09:16,886 --> 01:09:19,053
Please, sit down.

851
01:09:29,131 --> 01:09:33,501
Uh, pa says that you
have some information
on joe diamond.

852
01:09:33,568 --> 01:09:36,004
Oh, yeah, but...

853
01:09:36,071 --> 01:09:39,173
Before we get into that,
I, uh-

854
01:09:39,241 --> 01:09:41,776
I wanna tell you
that I'm apologetic
about-

855
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:44,746
About what happened
to your brother,
even at this late date.

856
01:09:46,081 --> 01:09:48,850
But, uh, unfortunately,
mr. Kegan,

857
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:51,185
You always hear
about these things
too late.

858
01:09:52,421 --> 01:09:55,123
<i>I was on key biscayne
at the time.</i>

859
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:59,127
But I could have done nothing,
anyway, because, uh,
it wasn't our business, see?

860
01:09:59,194 --> 01:10:01,128
They, uh-
they did it on their own.

861
01:10:01,196 --> 01:10:04,348
Mr. Mayo,

862
01:10:04,416 --> 01:10:07,918
Who actually made the contract
to kill the president?

863
01:10:07,986 --> 01:10:10,354
see what I mean?

864
01:10:11,957 --> 01:10:14,825
That, for me,
has always been a mystery.
I don't know.

865
01:10:18,763 --> 01:10:21,465
What about diamond's
connections in cuba?

866
01:10:21,533 --> 01:10:24,202
Diamond had no connections
in cuba.

867
01:10:24,269 --> 01:10:26,637
Well, irving mentor
says he did.

868
01:10:28,873 --> 01:10:31,709
Irving mentor.

869
01:10:31,776 --> 01:10:33,711
Mm-mmm.
I never heard of him.

870
01:10:33,778 --> 01:10:37,415
<i>Who send you to this, uh,
to this mentor man?</i>

871
01:10:38,833 --> 01:10:41,052
A friend.

872
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:43,554
Mm.

873
01:10:43,622 --> 01:10:46,124
That's funny.

874
01:10:46,192 --> 01:10:48,626
No, no, no.
No, diamond was
never in cuba.

875
01:10:48,694 --> 01:10:51,396
I'm told he was out of-
out of chicago.

876
01:10:52,631 --> 01:10:54,799
Mr. Kegan, uh,

877
01:10:56,601 --> 01:10:58,536
You're getting
the runaround here.

878
01:11:10,032 --> 01:11:14,418
I'm sorry, sir.
Personnel has no record
of any yvette malone.

879
01:11:14,486 --> 01:11:16,804
She works here.
Apparently not.

880
01:11:19,308 --> 01:11:22,677
Could you check again?
I mean, you must
have a record of her.

881
01:11:22,744 --> 01:11:26,431
Sir, this is
national magazine.

882
01:11:26,498 --> 01:11:29,434
Everything we must have,
we have.

883
01:11:32,921 --> 01:11:35,006
Thank you.

884
01:11:42,414 --> 01:11:47,234
It's no good, mister.
The lady in 12-g
is 62 years old.

885
01:11:47,302 --> 01:11:50,938
Drinks like a fish.
But yvette lived here.
I visited her here.

886
01:11:51,006 --> 01:11:53,941
Why don't you try number 86?
Maybe you got
the wrong building.

887
01:11:54,276 --> 01:11:56,610
You have nobody
of that description?

888
01:11:56,678 --> 01:12:01,749
Buddy, we haven't
had a good-looking woman
in this building in four years.

889
01:12:01,817 --> 01:12:04,552
Floor upon floor
of ugly people
is all we got.

890
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:07,805
Here's 50 bucks.
I gotta find her.

891
01:12:08,874 --> 01:12:10,808
Make it a hundred.

892
01:12:10,876 --> 01:12:13,478
I'll tell you
everything I know.

893
01:12:13,545 --> 01:12:15,813
Okay.
Here's a hundred.

894
01:12:15,881 --> 01:12:17,815
I already told you
everything I know.

895
01:12:17,883 --> 01:12:21,585
No such person
ever occupied these premises!

896
01:12:21,653 --> 01:12:24,322
- Look here, mister.
- Now, hold on, cocksucker.

897
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:26,391
You can't buy me, huh?

898
01:12:26,458 --> 01:12:31,345
You don't accept my word for it,
you deserve to pay. Now,
get the hell out of my si-

899
01:12:31,413 --> 01:12:35,132
Come on! Come on!
I'll bop your skull open,
you bastard, you!

900
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:38,602
Your money can't buy me, huh?
You give me the creeps.
Get out of here!

901
01:12:38,670 --> 01:12:41,973
Go on!
Filthy bastard, you.

902
01:12:42,574 --> 01:12:45,059
You give me the creeps,
all of you! Go on!

903
01:12:47,079 --> 01:12:49,013
Then I'll say
good night, sir.

904
01:12:49,081 --> 01:12:51,015
Oh, uh, raymond.
Sir?

905
01:12:51,083 --> 01:12:54,285
Do we have any ovaltine?
Ovaltine?

906
01:12:54,353 --> 01:12:57,522
I think I'd like some
before I go to sleep
tonight.

907
01:12:57,589 --> 01:13:02,527
I seem to remember when
I was a kid I had this cup
with a borden's cow on it.

908
01:13:02,594 --> 01:13:05,196
Cow, sir?

909
01:13:05,264 --> 01:13:07,365
Oh, just give me
a glass of milk.

910
01:13:07,433 --> 01:13:09,400
Very good, sir.

911
01:13:39,981 --> 01:13:44,285
Boy! I have
come back for you!

912
01:13:44,353 --> 01:13:46,504
Now, wait!

913
01:13:46,572 --> 01:13:48,472
Wait! Hey!

914
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:51,091
<i>Hey! Wakey, wakey, wakey!</i>

915
01:13:51,159 --> 01:13:53,193
<i>It's me!</i>

916
01:13:55,063 --> 01:13:57,698
- You're a dead ghost!
- Like hell I am.

917
01:13:57,766 --> 01:14:00,534
<i>Pa said you're dead.
Do I look dead?</i>

918
01:14:00,602 --> 01:14:02,536
<i>I need some sleep, but...</i>

919
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:06,507
They're still
dredging for my body
and I've still got it.

920
01:14:09,010 --> 01:14:12,446
<i>- Then you're not dead.
- No. I got an obit
in the times...</i>

921
01:14:13,915 --> 01:14:15,850
But I am not dead.

922
01:14:15,917 --> 01:14:17,852
Now, when they
got the medic,

923
01:14:17,919 --> 01:14:21,438
I figured
it was healthier
not to be alive.

924
01:14:21,506 --> 01:14:24,008
yeah.

925
01:14:25,277 --> 01:14:28,345
Ain't you
glad to see me?

926
01:14:32,918 --> 01:14:35,903
It's a conundrum-

927
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:38,005
Riddles within riddles.

928
01:14:38,073 --> 01:14:40,557
Now yvette's gone.

929
01:14:40,625 --> 01:14:43,443
That broad we met in paris?
The one you kept calling?

930
01:14:43,511 --> 01:14:47,347
- I wanna marry her.
- You're gonna give
the whole thing up?

931
01:14:47,415 --> 01:14:51,618
Someone is trying to teach me
a lesson in futility. Why am I
the only one who wasn't killed?

932
01:14:54,539 --> 01:14:56,974
They will run you dizzy.

933
01:14:57,042 --> 01:14:59,610
They will pile falsehood
on top of falsehood...

934
01:14:59,678 --> 01:15:03,614
Until you can't
tell a lie from the truth
and you won't even want to.

935
01:15:03,682 --> 01:15:07,518
That's how the powerful
keep their power.
Don't you read the papers?

936
01:15:07,586 --> 01:15:11,838
<i>You've got to accept
that there is a world
outside of you...</i>

937
01:15:11,906 --> 01:15:13,840
And that
you affect that world.

938
01:15:13,908 --> 01:15:17,011
- Your dad knows it.
- Pa thinks, uh,

939
01:15:17,078 --> 01:15:20,014
Moses lied about
the ten commandments,
because what god really said...

940
01:15:20,081 --> 01:15:22,433
Was, "do what you want,
but don't get caught."

941
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:27,071
- Pa's awareness is global.
- Yeah, so is mud.

942
01:15:27,138 --> 01:15:30,157
Nick, use him.
Use the organization.

943
01:15:30,224 --> 01:15:33,177
He's got more clout
than the common market,

944
01:15:33,244 --> 01:15:36,747
And you're taking
the advice of a broad
who's probably a plant.

945
01:15:36,815 --> 01:15:38,916
Now, you could've
been killed in that diner.

946
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:46,190
- I thought you liked
staying alive.
- come on.

947
01:15:53,932 --> 01:15:58,035
I'm gonna find her.
Go to cerruti.
He works for you, remember?

948
01:15:59,938 --> 01:16:02,356
- What about you?
- I'm gonna stay dead
for awhile.

949
01:16:02,423 --> 01:16:04,358
I feel healthier that way.

950
01:16:08,363 --> 01:16:11,949
<i>Where are you going?
Gonna order cerruti
to produce yvette.</i>

951
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:20,007
This is the contract silo, nick.

952
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:22,343
Contracts, contracts,
contracts.

953
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:24,745
Agreements kept.
Agreements broken.

954
01:16:24,813 --> 01:16:26,747
Papers, papers, papers.

955
01:16:26,815 --> 01:16:29,683
Signatures. Your father's
holograph signature...

956
01:16:29,751 --> 01:16:33,354
On his interlocking companies
going back, oh, 30 years.

957
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:36,357
Also those of diplomats,
authors and inventors.

958
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:38,359
Tax deals.
Foundation deals.

959
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:40,928
Signatures of presidents
and sheiks.

960
01:16:40,995 --> 01:16:43,597
Signatures to put men away
for, oh, decades.

961
01:16:43,665 --> 01:16:46,800
Destroy careers, public lives,
marriages, estates.

962
01:16:46,868 --> 01:16:51,088
Love affairs. Letters
of passion, indiscretion
and conspiracy...

963
01:16:51,156 --> 01:16:53,757
Acquired by your father's
intelligence network.

964
01:16:53,825 --> 01:16:58,662
Letters to persuade a man
to close a deal or leave a job
or sell out on his brother.

965
01:16:58,730 --> 01:17:01,665
Data necessary to sustain
a financial empire.

966
01:17:01,733 --> 01:17:04,101
and here-

967
01:17:04,169 --> 01:17:09,340
Here are the spoken words.
Shh. Voices and sounds.

968
01:17:10,876 --> 01:17:15,462
And visuals.
Pictures on microfilm.
Movies. Video.

969
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:18,398
Marvelous little gadgets
that document verbatim...

970
01:17:18,466 --> 01:17:20,968
All your father's conversations
with all his people.

971
01:17:21,036 --> 01:17:23,804
And his people's
conversations with others.

972
01:17:23,872 --> 01:17:25,806
From our satellite,
we can watch everything.

973
01:17:25,874 --> 01:17:29,476
Nasty little wars in africa.
Troop movements. Ship movements.
Nuclear tests.

974
01:17:29,544 --> 01:17:31,478
The sinai.
The panama canal.

975
01:17:31,546 --> 01:17:34,815
Every little thing
to check an investment,
buy us in or out.

976
01:17:34,883 --> 01:17:36,984
Even tonight,
while most of
our workers sleep,

977
01:17:37,052 --> 01:17:39,220
<i>It goes on.</i>

978
01:17:41,623 --> 01:17:44,158
take a coffee break,
gentlemen.

979
01:17:44,226 --> 01:17:47,128
I have a rare visitor
and we'd like to be alone.

980
01:17:48,630 --> 01:17:51,165
Information.
Black holes
of information.

981
01:17:51,233 --> 01:17:55,669
Galaxies within galaxies.
Multiple expanding universes
of information.

982
01:17:57,505 --> 01:17:59,573
Aren't you glad
you came?

983
01:18:00,909 --> 01:18:03,343
Pa never allowed the family
here in his office.

984
01:18:03,411 --> 01:18:05,846
Ah. Misjudgment.
You'll run all this
someday.

985
01:18:05,914 --> 01:18:07,848
You'll need to know.

986
01:18:07,916 --> 01:18:10,350
All this and you couldn't
find my brother's killer?

987
01:18:10,418 --> 01:18:13,120
<i>I'm so glad you're here.
I receive so few outsiders.</i>

988
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:15,122
<i>Who to trust?
Who to trust?</i>

989
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:16,957
All the nerves
but none of the flesh.

990
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:29,703
End of our social.
Why did you come here
without an appointment?

991
01:18:29,771 --> 01:18:33,207
What do you want?
I want to find
yvette malone.

992
01:18:33,275 --> 01:18:36,410
Impossible.
She's been kidnapped.
Kidnapped?

993
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:39,896
Yeah. Abducted, swept away,
taken off, snatched-
kidnapped.

994
01:18:39,964 --> 01:18:44,801
- By whom?
- The kidnappers.
Bad guys. Casper jr.

995
01:18:47,105 --> 01:18:50,274
where are you going?

996
01:18:50,342 --> 01:18:53,210
To find my father.

997
01:18:53,278 --> 01:18:55,880
I just realized.

998
01:18:55,947 --> 01:18:58,549
He's been keeping me alive.
He's protecting me.

999
01:18:58,616 --> 01:19:00,651
She's... Involved, nick.

1000
01:19:02,287 --> 01:19:04,855
Miss malone's involved.

1001
01:19:04,923 --> 01:19:08,125
It wasn't the tubesters
who got to diamond.
We have new information.

1002
01:19:08,192 --> 01:19:10,561
- While you sleep, we continue.
- Who was it?

1003
01:19:10,628 --> 01:19:13,613
You met the man this afternoon.
Frank mayo.

1004
01:19:13,681 --> 01:19:17,251
And it was lola comante
who got to mayo
and had the president killed.

1005
01:19:17,319 --> 01:19:20,321
¶

1006
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:25,625
Miss lola comante!

1007
01:19:28,463 --> 01:19:31,865
thrice married by 23,
movie queen at 30,

1008
01:19:31,933 --> 01:19:35,102
Lola entered middle age
as friend of the shady
and legit alike...

1009
01:19:35,170 --> 01:19:37,938
With the special power
of a president's procuress.

1010
01:19:38,005 --> 01:19:42,343
Lola got tim his girls,
and he blessed her
with fame and fortune.

1011
01:19:49,351 --> 01:19:52,286
Tim enjoyed her favors
and the favors of her friends...

1012
01:19:52,354 --> 01:19:54,154
In the privacy of rockrimmon.

1013
01:20:08,036 --> 01:20:09,970
Sanctioned and abetted
by your father,

1014
01:20:10,038 --> 01:20:12,556
Who occasionally
indulged in lola himself...

1015
01:20:12,623 --> 01:20:14,825
And who also had some
business connections with her.

1016
01:20:19,747 --> 01:20:24,151
Until it all ended one day when
lola tried to collect on a deal.

1017
01:20:24,219 --> 01:20:26,654
Enchanted by ambition
as she was,

1018
01:20:26,722 --> 01:20:29,657
Lola had arranged a $2 million
campaign contribution...

1019
01:20:29,725 --> 01:20:31,659
From the family of frank mayo.

1020
01:20:31,727 --> 01:20:33,894
Mayo wanted the president
to kick out castro...

1021
01:20:33,962 --> 01:20:36,831
And restore the casinos
to havana.

1022
01:20:36,898 --> 01:20:40,835
But the president was aware
of no such contribution
and no such deal.

1023
01:20:40,902 --> 01:20:44,004
It was your father
who had accepted
the money from lola.

1024
01:20:52,730 --> 01:20:54,999
When did you get
so lily-white, son?

1025
01:20:55,066 --> 01:20:57,101
Been reading
your own press?

1026
01:20:57,168 --> 01:20:59,203
This thing's
gone to your head.

1027
01:20:59,270 --> 01:21:01,271
Sure, I took that cash.

1028
01:21:01,339 --> 01:21:03,941
You think
you got those votes
on your good looks?

1029
01:21:04,009 --> 01:21:08,345
I bought 'em and I paid
for 'em. And when
I needed cash, I got it.

1030
01:21:08,412 --> 01:21:11,348
Now, uh,
you remember your debts.

1031
01:21:11,415 --> 01:21:14,751
You want out of this
cuban thing, you gotta
pay back another way.

1032
01:21:14,819 --> 01:21:18,421
And, uh, be nice to lola.
She's on your side.

1033
01:21:20,591 --> 01:21:25,195
Where you going?
Hey. Where you going?

1034
01:21:25,263 --> 01:21:28,198
Come back here!
I'm your father!

1035
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:38,775
Goddamn it!
Why do you think
I got you this job?

1036
01:21:38,843 --> 01:21:41,111
To review the fucking fleet?

1037
01:21:43,031 --> 01:21:46,066
the president broke contact with
your father on this matter...

1038
01:21:46,134 --> 01:21:48,068
And with lola as well.

1039
01:21:48,136 --> 01:21:50,137
He never spoke
to either one again.

1040
01:21:50,204 --> 01:21:52,139
<i>so tim turned against pa?</i>

1041
01:21:52,206 --> 01:21:54,908
Mm. It hurt your father
a great deal,

1042
01:21:54,976 --> 01:21:58,645
Both personally
and... Financially.

1043
01:21:58,713 --> 01:22:02,365
Then it was mayo
who killed my brother and
you've known it all along.

1044
01:22:02,433 --> 01:22:04,367
A qualified no
on both counts.

1045
01:22:04,435 --> 01:22:06,837
- Z.K. Dawson.
- The guy in the tank?

1046
01:22:06,905 --> 01:22:11,875
No, no, no. Not that asshole.
The real dawson who hasn't left
venezuela since 1956.

1047
01:22:11,943 --> 01:22:16,046
Your oklahoma adventure
was a little something
I cooked up.
You cooked up?

1048
01:22:16,113 --> 01:22:19,015
Yes. A scene. A skit.

1049
01:22:19,083 --> 01:22:21,652
Rather humorous, I thought,
with a point.

1050
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:23,987
And what can the point be,
mr. Cerruti?

1051
01:22:24,055 --> 01:22:28,592
You see, it wasn't
dawson himself who plotted
your brother's assassination.

1052
01:22:28,660 --> 01:22:32,429
It was his only daughter-
formerly maggie dawson,
then mrs. Luigi bellini...

1053
01:22:32,497 --> 01:22:35,165
And lately-

1054
01:22:35,233 --> 01:22:36,934
Yvette?

1055
01:22:37,001 --> 01:22:40,771
The attraction between you two
becomes romeo-and-julietish, no?
Opposing families.

1056
01:22:40,839 --> 01:22:44,808
- That is ridiculous!
- Don't snap at me, you.

1057
01:22:44,876 --> 01:22:49,029
She plotted the whole thing.
She was your brother's mistress
too. Bet you didn't know that.

1058
01:22:49,096 --> 01:22:53,100
- Where is she now?
- Yvette? I told you.
Kidnapped.

1059
01:22:53,168 --> 01:22:56,636
- By whom?
- By whom? By the kidnappers.

1060
01:22:56,704 --> 01:22:59,273
Bad guys. Casper jr.

1061
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:02,409
you are lying, cerruti.

1062
01:23:02,476 --> 01:23:04,577
No one's allowed up here,
nick.

1063
01:23:04,645 --> 01:23:07,981
Tell me where she is
or I'm gonna blow this
whole thing open.

1064
01:23:08,049 --> 01:23:10,984
No way. You're not
to be believed.
What have you got?

1065
01:23:11,052 --> 01:23:14,321
A half a dozen
different scenarios all going
in opposite directions.

1066
01:23:14,389 --> 01:23:18,392
Fantasies. They'd lock you
away in the booby bin.
You're no threat to me.

1067
01:23:20,094 --> 01:23:23,596
You give me this information
or I'm gonna get it
the old-fashioned way.

1068
01:23:23,664 --> 01:23:25,665
The ol- oh.
The old-fashioned way.

1069
01:23:25,733 --> 01:23:28,435
I see. What are you gonna do,
break my arms?

1070
01:23:28,486 --> 01:23:30,770
God, it's painful
to see you like this, nick.

1071
01:23:30,838 --> 01:23:33,907
It's painful to see you
suffering under a delusion
so intense,

1072
01:23:33,975 --> 01:23:36,810
So aggravating
that you actually believe
that you have the nerve...

1073
01:23:36,877 --> 01:23:39,046
To come in here
and threaten me like this.

1074
01:23:39,113 --> 01:23:41,114
You're just not the type.

1075
01:23:44,118 --> 01:23:46,620
Did you hear that?
Did you hear that,
you clown?

1076
01:23:46,688 --> 01:23:49,022
You've broken my arm.
Is it him?

1077
01:23:49,090 --> 01:23:51,225
Huh? Huh?
Is it pa?

1078
01:23:51,292 --> 01:23:53,577
Is it him?

1079
01:23:54,912 --> 01:23:57,914
Please tell me.
Is it pa?

1080
01:24:01,586 --> 01:24:03,587
<i>ow!</i>

1081
01:24:08,092 --> 01:24:10,093
Is it pa, cerruti?

1082
01:24:11,129 --> 01:24:13,063
Your legs are next.

1083
01:24:13,131 --> 01:24:15,966
Cerruti, is it pa?

1084
01:24:16,033 --> 01:24:18,635
Your father spent $11 million
to raise your brother up...

1085
01:24:18,703 --> 01:24:21,538
From a skirt-chasing
college boy to president
of the United States.

1086
01:24:21,606 --> 01:24:24,941
For 20 years,
he told him what to do
and how and why...

1087
01:24:25,009 --> 01:24:27,177
And what would happen
when it was done.

1088
01:24:27,245 --> 01:24:29,546
Your father put tim
in the white house. Why?

1089
01:24:29,614 --> 01:24:32,082
Because that's where you
can generate the most cash.

1090
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:35,619
A cold-ass business proposition
like everything else in society.

1091
01:24:36,954 --> 01:24:39,256
But your brother decided
to stir up the population,

1092
01:24:39,324 --> 01:24:41,892
Began to think we were
all living in a democracy.

1093
01:24:41,959 --> 01:24:44,961
He started believing it.
Lunch with de gaulle,
dinner with kruschev.

1094
01:24:45,029 --> 01:24:47,164
The whole razzle-dazzle
went to his head.

1095
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:50,066
Yet in spite of the fact that
everybody in this country...

1096
01:24:50,134 --> 01:24:52,169
Lives in the same
dog-eat-dog way,

1097
01:24:52,237 --> 01:24:54,171
Grabbing any angle
to make a buck,

1098
01:24:54,239 --> 01:24:57,207
If you were to inform them
that your father had tim killed,

1099
01:24:57,275 --> 01:24:59,743
They'd wanna
tear the old man
apart limb from limb.

1100
01:24:59,810 --> 01:25:01,912
Pa had-
pa had him killed?

1101
01:25:01,979 --> 01:25:05,449
What the hell?
That's the system
you wanted, nick,

1102
01:25:05,517 --> 01:25:07,451
And that's the system
you've got.

1103
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:10,554
The whole secret,
as your father says,
is not to get caught.

1104
01:25:12,490 --> 01:25:15,259
I want to find yvette.
Yvette malone...

1105
01:25:15,326 --> 01:25:18,094
Was a professional actress
named jenny o'brien,

1106
01:25:18,162 --> 01:25:21,097
But I don't think she wants
to see you today, nick.

1107
01:25:21,165 --> 01:25:24,901
She's the guest of a freshman
anatomy class over at kegan
university medical school...

1108
01:25:24,969 --> 01:25:28,038
And she's
kinda tied up right now,
if you get the picture.

1109
01:25:28,105 --> 01:25:31,341
You get the picture, nick?
You get the picture?

1110
01:25:35,346 --> 01:25:37,681
You get the picture, nick?

1111
01:26:11,549 --> 01:26:13,550
Don't touch.

1112
01:26:47,869 --> 01:26:50,070
What the hell?
He was caught
trying to enter.

1113
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:53,506
That's my son!

1114
01:26:55,609 --> 01:26:59,346
He refused to tell us
his name, mr. Kegan.

1115
01:27:01,115 --> 01:27:04,550
Rosemary will call dr. Grokest
when she comes in.

1116
01:27:04,618 --> 01:27:06,786
You sure
made a night of it, boy.

1117
01:27:21,202 --> 01:27:24,204
You should have called first.
Ought to know that by now.

1118
01:27:27,291 --> 01:27:29,359
I'll get you some whiskey.

1119
01:27:32,797 --> 01:27:35,465
You want those fellas fired,
I'll have 'em fired.

1120
01:27:37,635 --> 01:27:39,803
Good men, though.

1121
01:27:41,139 --> 01:27:43,073
Ah. You gonna
pass out on me?

1122
01:27:43,141 --> 01:27:46,943
Pa, cerruti
told me everything.

1123
01:27:48,362 --> 01:27:51,297
- You saw cerruti?
- You killed him.

1124
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:54,835
Your own son.

1125
01:28:07,181 --> 01:28:09,349
<i>Was it really
for money?</i>

1126
01:28:18,459 --> 01:28:20,443
Rosemary, where the hell
are my cigars?

1127
01:28:20,511 --> 01:28:22,512
Rosemary!

1128
01:28:36,527 --> 01:28:39,028
a wise man
fools the doctors.

1129
01:28:50,708 --> 01:28:53,309
Was it for money?

1130
01:28:54,712 --> 01:28:57,814
Where did you get the balls
to suggest to me...

1131
01:28:57,882 --> 01:29:01,317
That I'd have
your brother murdered
for some additional cash?

1132
01:29:01,385 --> 01:29:03,654
The president
of my country.

1133
01:29:03,721 --> 01:29:07,824
Is this an attack, son?
A conspiracy? Have you
gone over to the enemy?

1134
01:29:07,892 --> 01:29:10,160
Or are you mad?

1135
01:29:10,227 --> 01:29:12,496
for money.

1136
01:29:12,563 --> 01:29:16,433
Shame.
For shame on you.

1137
01:29:18,502 --> 01:29:21,338
Somewhere deep
in your soul, pa,

1138
01:29:21,405 --> 01:29:24,524
You wanna get caught
and punished.

1139
01:29:24,592 --> 01:29:27,727
Like a petty thief
back to the scene
of a crime.

1140
01:29:27,795 --> 01:29:32,699
Petty thief? Hell,
I'm the king of thieves,

1141
01:29:32,767 --> 01:29:35,368
The jupiter of thieves.

1142
01:29:35,436 --> 01:29:37,537
But I'm not a killer.

1143
01:29:39,106 --> 01:29:43,042
There he is...
And there and there.

1144
01:29:43,110 --> 01:29:45,378
My guardian angel.

1145
01:29:45,446 --> 01:29:47,380
My unseen listener.

1146
01:29:47,448 --> 01:29:49,382
John cerruti.

1147
01:29:49,450 --> 01:29:51,551
Somewhere in the air,

1148
01:29:51,619 --> 01:29:54,788
Recording, peeking in.

1149
01:29:56,290 --> 01:29:58,624
John cerruti killed tim.

1150
01:29:58,692 --> 01:30:01,044
Cerruti.

1151
01:30:01,112 --> 01:30:03,547
Did it with my men
and my money.

1152
01:30:03,614 --> 01:30:06,049
And the profits
went into my companies.

1153
01:30:06,117 --> 01:30:10,220
When he told me he'd killed
my son, there was nothing
I could do against him,

1154
01:30:10,288 --> 01:30:12,822
'cause every finger
in the country
would point to me.

1155
01:30:12,890 --> 01:30:14,891
Tim's own pa.

1156
01:30:14,959 --> 01:30:17,727
And you too.
And our family.

1157
01:30:17,795 --> 01:30:22,399
- No, pa.
- You think I'm in control here?

1158
01:30:22,467 --> 01:30:25,235
I'm nothing
but a goddamn front.

1159
01:30:25,303 --> 01:30:28,472
Cerruti has run everything
since the day tim was shot.

1160
01:30:31,659 --> 01:30:33,660
Darndest part-

1161
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:37,630
Don't even
give himself a raise.

1162
01:30:37,698 --> 01:30:39,499
Lives in brooklyn
in a rabbit hole.

1163
01:30:47,825 --> 01:30:50,193
<i>Whatcha doing?
I'm calling the police.</i>

1164
01:30:50,261 --> 01:30:52,595
You begging to die?

1165
01:30:52,663 --> 01:30:54,931
You got eyes
in that empty head?

1166
01:30:54,999 --> 01:30:58,935
Look, I'm an old man-
skin sagging, false teeth,
eyes milking over.

1167
01:30:59,003 --> 01:31:02,005
But I've been
holding this thing together
with the minutes ticking by...

1168
01:31:02,073 --> 01:31:05,408
'cause when this old clock
comes undone, you watch
where the wheels will fly.

1169
01:31:05,475 --> 01:31:10,280
- I won't buy it, pa.
- I'm standing between you
and darkest night, son.

1170
01:31:10,347 --> 01:31:12,282
The other side of me
is chaos.

1171
01:31:14,035 --> 01:31:17,137
Hold it, keifitz.
We won't need the gun.

1172
01:31:17,205 --> 01:31:21,041
Won't need the gun?
God, son, it must've been
the milkman after all,

1173
01:31:21,108 --> 01:31:23,609
'cause you sure as hell
ain't no part of me.

1174
01:31:23,677 --> 01:31:25,929
That man damn well
needs his gun...

1175
01:31:27,998 --> 01:31:30,366
'cause he's gonna
shoot you with it.

1176
01:32:03,050 --> 01:32:05,335
Pa!

1177
01:32:05,403 --> 01:32:07,571
Pa, take my hand!

1178
01:32:07,638 --> 01:32:11,141
Stupid!
You wanna go with me?
Take my hand, pa!

1179
01:32:13,961 --> 01:32:16,746
You get out of this alive, son-

1180
01:32:16,814 --> 01:32:18,748
You get out of this alive.

1181
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:22,969
Take our money
out of the western world
and put it in south america.

1182
01:32:23,004 --> 01:32:26,639
- Oh!
- Brazil. Ah!

1183
01:32:26,707 --> 01:32:29,793
- Aah!
- Brazil! They're
the next ones up!

1184
01:32:52,449 --> 01:32:55,234
Pa's dead.

1185
01:32:55,302 --> 01:32:57,169
I'll connect you
with john cerruti.

1186
01:32:57,237 --> 01:32:59,538
Call the police, rosemary.

1187
01:33:01,125 --> 01:33:03,192
Yes, mr. Kegan.

1188
01:33:16,741 --> 01:33:19,308
Are you coming back?

1189
01:33:21,145 --> 01:33:23,312
I'm part of the family.

1190
01:33:39,163 --> 01:33:43,099
Hello. This is
yvette malone speaking.

1191
01:33:43,167 --> 01:33:45,101
I'm not home just now,

1192
01:33:45,169 --> 01:33:48,772
But if you'll be kind enough
to leave your name
and telephone number,

1193
01:33:48,839 --> 01:33:50,941
I'll call you when I return.

1194
01:33:51,008 --> 01:33:52,943
Please begin
