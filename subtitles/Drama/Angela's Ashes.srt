1
00:01:01,664 --> 00:01:03,624
When I look back on my childhood,

2
00:01:03,704 --> 00:01:07,224
I wonder how my brothers and I
managed to survive at all.

3
00:01:07,264 --> 00:01:09,304
It was, of course,
a miserable childhood.

4
00:01:09,384 --> 00:01:12,544
The happy childhood
is hardly worth your while.

5
00:01:12,584 --> 00:01:15,064
Worse than the ordinary
miserable childhood...

6
00:01:15,144 --> 00:01:17,024
is the miserable
Irish childhood.

7
00:01:17,064 --> 00:01:22,744
And worse yet is the miserable
Irish Catholic childhood.

8
00:01:38,864 --> 00:01:41,704
You beautiful wee thing.

9
00:01:41,784 --> 00:01:43,744
You are. Look at you.

10
00:01:43,824 --> 00:01:45,664
So gorgeous.

11
00:01:47,224 --> 00:01:49,544
What is it?

12
00:01:49,624 --> 00:01:52,664
It's a beautiful wee girl,
Mrs. Leibowitz.

13
00:01:52,744 --> 00:01:57,144
After four boys. Can you believe it?
A wee girl.

14
00:01:57,224 --> 00:01:59,144
What name is it, Malachy?

15
00:01:59,224 --> 00:02:01,344
It's Margaret Mary.

16
00:02:01,424 --> 00:02:03,264
Oh, she's so beautiful,
Minnie.

17
00:02:03,344 --> 00:02:06,784
Brown hair and blue eyes.

18
00:02:06,864 --> 00:02:09,784
Just like her mom.

19
00:02:09,864 --> 00:02:12,024
BeautifuI wee thing.

20
00:02:12,104 --> 00:02:14,424
Aren't you?

21
00:02:16,544 --> 00:02:18,664
Come on, Eugene.

22
00:02:18,744 --> 00:02:22,584
Oliver, come on. Splash.
Eugene, come on. Stop crying.

23
00:02:22,664 --> 00:02:24,184
Good boy.

24
00:02:24,264 --> 00:02:29,344
We're in the bath. Bubbles.
Don't cry, Eugene. Don't cry.

25
00:02:29,424 --> 00:02:33,224
- Hey, Eugene, look at my bum. Ooh.
- Malachy, stop showing your bum.

26
00:02:33,304 --> 00:02:35,144
I'm only trying
to make them laugh.

27
00:02:35,224 --> 00:02:38,624
Come on, Oliver.
Come on. Stop crying.

28
00:03:06,384 --> 00:03:10,824
Swee tJesus in heaven,
Malachy.

29
00:03:16,144 --> 00:03:18,704
She's awful quiet, Angela.

30
00:03:30,704 --> 00:03:32,624
A wee bit cold.

31
00:03:52,944 --> 00:03:56,224
I'll get Mrs. Leibowitz.

32
00:03:56,304 --> 00:03:58,584
Everyone loved little Margaret.

33
00:03:58,624 --> 00:04:02,504
Dad said there must have been a holiday
in heaven the day this baby was made.

34
00:04:02,584 --> 00:04:04,464
Dad said he would
get a job soon...

35
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:08,944
and buy her dresses of silk
and shoes with silver buckles.

36
00:04:09,024 --> 00:04:11,424
Poor little Margaret.

37
00:04:11,504 --> 00:04:14,544
Just a few days in this world
and she was taken back...

38
00:04:14,624 --> 00:04:17,464
by the same angels
who brought her here.

39
00:04:20,104 --> 00:04:23,384
- God, look at these twins.
- Stop crying, Ollie.

40
00:04:23,464 --> 00:04:25,304
Eugene, please.

41
00:04:25,384 --> 00:04:28,664
Frankie, I can't do this.
Where do I put the pin?

42
00:04:28,744 --> 00:04:31,344
Me dad said
he was going for cigarettes,

43
00:04:31,424 --> 00:04:34,344
and the twins
just screamed and screamed.

44
00:04:34,424 --> 00:04:37,904
Thank God for Mrs. Leibowitz
who lived upstairs.

45
00:04:42,744 --> 00:04:46,664
Boys, oh, my.
What happened to you, huh?

46
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:49,184
Where's your mother?
What do you want?

47
00:04:49,264 --> 00:04:51,784
We've got no dinner.

48
00:04:54,584 --> 00:04:57,664
Now eat
just a little bit more.

49
00:04:57,744 --> 00:05:00,864
Come on, Angela.
You have to eat.

50
00:05:00,944 --> 00:05:03,464
Good. Good. Good.
Good. Good. Good.

51
00:05:06,704 --> 00:05:08,504
Come on. Come on.

52
00:05:16,384 --> 00:05:18,064
Mommy.

53
00:05:18,144 --> 00:05:20,184
Oh, my God.

54
00:05:20,264 --> 00:05:23,064
The children
are naked, Delia.

55
00:05:23,144 --> 00:05:24,984
Where did Angela get
such filthy habits?

56
00:05:25,064 --> 00:05:27,744
Her mother
was always spotless.

57
00:05:28,944 --> 00:05:32,424
Yech!
The stink is awful!

58
00:05:32,504 --> 00:05:35,024
It's the twins.
Their arses are shitty.

59
00:05:35,104 --> 00:05:37,944
It's a mouth like a sewer
you have. No wonder.

60
00:05:37,984 --> 00:05:39,864
With a father
from the North of Ireland...

61
00:05:39,904 --> 00:05:41,144
with his funny manner
and his Protestant ways.

62
00:05:41,224 --> 00:05:44,184
You could go to hell saying a thing
like that. Where is your father?

63
00:05:44,264 --> 00:05:46,104
He went for cigarettes.

64
00:05:46,144 --> 00:05:49,784
- Two days ago.
- I'll break his face, I swear.

65
00:05:49,824 --> 00:05:53,744
Dad will be home soon.

66
00:05:53,824 --> 00:05:55,824
Come on, Oliver.
Come on, Eugene.

67
00:05:55,904 --> 00:05:59,264
Get paper and a pen, Delia.
We have a letter to write.

68
00:06:12,704 --> 00:06:14,584
My aunts wrote to my mam's mother...

69
00:06:14,664 --> 00:06:16,704
to send money
for the tickets.

70
00:06:16,784 --> 00:06:18,984
We must have been the only
Irish family in history...

71
00:06:19,064 --> 00:06:23,144
to be saying good-bye to
the Statue of Liberty instead of hello.

72
00:06:24,664 --> 00:06:28,304
We were going back to Ireland
where there was no work...

73
00:06:28,344 --> 00:06:31,304
and people were dying
of the starvation and the damp.

74
00:06:31,384 --> 00:06:35,224
It made no sense to me,
but what did I know.

75
00:06:35,304 --> 00:06:39,144
I was only five
going on six.

76
00:07:15,944 --> 00:07:17,904
Christ, look at that coat.

77
00:07:17,944 --> 00:07:19,824
Get you buttoned up.

78
00:07:19,864 --> 00:07:21,744
There we are now.

79
00:07:21,784 --> 00:07:23,664
I'll take him
to the lavatories,

80
00:07:23,704 --> 00:07:25,584
then I'm off to see
the I.R.A. man for me money.

81
00:07:25,624 --> 00:07:27,704
Francis, you can come with me
for the company, eh?

82
00:07:27,784 --> 00:07:29,744
I'll be needing him
to help me here.

83
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,424
Won't I be needing him
to help me carry all the money?

84
00:07:32,504 --> 00:07:35,904
All right, Frankie, you can
go with your pop. Malachy!

85
00:07:35,984 --> 00:07:38,784
Malachy, don't go
to the lavatory there.

86
00:07:38,864 --> 00:07:40,704
- I can't stop.
- Peeing all over me.

87
00:07:40,784 --> 00:07:42,584
It's coming out.

88
00:07:42,624 --> 00:07:45,144
Da, Da, wait for me.
I wanna go.

89
00:07:47,984 --> 00:07:49,904
No record?

90
00:07:49,984 --> 00:07:52,624
But I did my bit
for Ireland.

91
00:07:52,704 --> 00:07:54,824
I fought with the Flying Columns
during the Troubles.

92
00:07:54,904 --> 00:07:56,744
Had a price on my head.

93
00:07:56,824 --> 00:07:59,304
Had to be smuggled
to America.

94
00:07:59,384 --> 00:08:03,344
There's no record
of your service here. None.

95
00:08:03,424 --> 00:08:05,664
But I have a wife
and four children.

96
00:08:05,744 --> 00:08:08,984
I'm raising my sons
to love Ireland.

97
00:08:09,024 --> 00:08:12,384
Look. Please.

98
00:08:14,104 --> 00:08:16,344
We have nothing.

99
00:08:16,384 --> 00:08:18,624
I'm sorry. We can't
be handing out money...

100
00:08:18,704 --> 00:08:20,824
to every man
who wanders in here...

101
00:08:20,904 --> 00:08:24,184
saying he did his bit
for Ireland.

102
00:08:24,224 --> 00:08:26,224
I'll look into your claim.

103
00:08:26,264 --> 00:08:28,504
I'll let you know
what turns up.

104
00:08:28,544 --> 00:08:31,744
Here's money for the bus
back into the city.

105
00:08:31,824 --> 00:08:35,864
You couldn't add to that
to make the price of a pint, could you?

106
00:08:35,944 --> 00:08:38,064
It's the drink
you're after, is it?

107
00:08:38,144 --> 00:08:40,744
One pint
is hardly a drink.

108
00:08:40,824 --> 00:08:44,664
You'd make that child walk back
into Dublin because you're after a pint?

109
00:08:44,744 --> 00:08:47,544
Remember this, Francis,
this is the new Ireland.

110
00:08:47,624 --> 00:08:50,584
Wee men in wee chairs
with wee bits of paper.

111
00:08:50,664 --> 00:08:53,464
I think you should leave.
Declan, the door.

112
00:08:53,544 --> 00:08:55,384
And don't bother
coming back.

113
00:08:55,464 --> 00:08:57,304
This is the Ireland
men died for, is it?

114
00:08:57,384 --> 00:09:00,184
Come on, Frankie.
Free, my arse.

115
00:09:00,224 --> 00:09:04,184
We're not handing out money
to support the Guinness family.

116
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:10,144
He wanted to marry her off
to the King of Sicily.

117
00:09:10,224 --> 00:09:13,984
But the beautiful
young Wilgefortis,

118
00:09:14,064 --> 00:09:17,184
she didn't want to be marrying
no scabby old man, did she?

119
00:09:17,264 --> 00:09:19,104
So, she prayed to God
for help.

120
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,024
And do you know
what he did, Frankie?

121
00:09:21,104 --> 00:09:22,944
No, what did he do?

122
00:09:23,024 --> 00:09:24,864
He grew a moustache
and a beard on her face.

123
00:09:24,944 --> 00:09:26,824
- He didn't.
- He did.

124
00:09:40,384 --> 00:09:43,024
Malachy,
move away from that window.

125
00:09:43,104 --> 00:09:45,864
Frank, take Eugene,
and don't forget your bag.

126
00:09:45,944 --> 00:09:50,064
Put your coat on.
Malachy, put your coat on now.

127
00:09:50,144 --> 00:09:52,664
I'm telling you
I'll kick you so hard.

128
00:09:54,984 --> 00:09:59,704
Here. There you go.

129
00:09:59,744 --> 00:10:02,744
Oliver's been sick on my jumper.

130
00:10:04,544 --> 00:10:06,264
Hello, Mam.

131
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:12,384
Oh, come on.

132
00:10:14,624 --> 00:10:16,464
This is Malachy.

133
00:10:16,544 --> 00:10:19,384
Mrs. Sheehan,
pleased to meet you.

134
00:10:21,024 --> 00:10:22,784
And Aggie.

135
00:10:22,824 --> 00:10:24,784
Hi, Aggie.
How are you?

136
00:10:28,104 --> 00:10:29,904
And Pat.

137
00:10:31,944 --> 00:10:33,744
Hi, Pat.

138
00:10:40,184 --> 00:10:42,664
What are you staring at?

139
00:10:42,744 --> 00:10:45,184
Nothing.

140
00:10:47,584 --> 00:10:50,704
Grandma said
she had no room for us in her house,

141
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:53,144
so she gave us 10 shillings
for two weeks' rent...

142
00:10:53,184 --> 00:10:55,104
in an upstairs room
in Windmill Street,

143
00:10:55,144 --> 00:10:57,224
near my mam's sister Aggie.

144
00:11:01,824 --> 00:11:05,384
- Mind yourself, Mrs. Sheehan.
- Look at that.

145
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:08,024
- I'll take the weight.
- Why is the heart on fire?

146
00:11:08,064 --> 00:11:10,264
It's the sacred heart
of Jesus.

147
00:11:10,304 --> 00:11:13,304
Don't these children
know anything about their religion?

148
00:11:13,344 --> 00:11:15,784
Ah, mom, it's different
in America.

149
00:11:15,864 --> 00:11:19,224
The Sacred Heart is everywhere.
Even in America.

150
00:11:19,264 --> 00:11:23,024
There's no excuse
for that kind of ignorance.

151
00:11:23,104 --> 00:11:25,064
Look. That's the Baby Jesus.

152
00:11:25,144 --> 00:11:28,344
And if you ever need anything,
you should pray to him.

153
00:11:28,384 --> 00:11:30,504
Will you tell Jesus
that we're hungry?

154
00:11:30,584 --> 00:11:32,464
Shut up!

155
00:11:57,064 --> 00:11:58,784
- Ma!
- Ma!

156
00:12:03,784 --> 00:12:05,904
They're biting me!

157
00:12:09,504 --> 00:12:12,504
- Mom, I'm bleeding!
- Hold your noise now.

158
00:12:12,544 --> 00:12:14,904
Look! Look at Malachy!
His arm's all bloody!

159
00:12:14,944 --> 00:12:16,824
It's the fleas, Angela.
They're everywhere.

160
00:12:16,864 --> 00:12:20,664
- Malachy, out of the bed.
- Jesus, will we get no rest?

161
00:12:20,704 --> 00:12:25,384
- Malachy, come on. Pull.
- Let's take the mattress downstairs.

162
00:12:25,464 --> 00:12:27,864
- Pull, Malachy, pull.
- Come on. Come to me.

163
00:12:27,904 --> 00:12:32,184
- Get the mattress downstairs.
- There's fleas on the floor!

164
00:12:32,224 --> 00:12:34,824
- That's it, on the ground.
- Ouch!

165
00:12:34,904 --> 00:12:36,824
Malachy, we're surely gonna
catch our death out here...

166
00:12:36,864 --> 00:12:38,704
and you'll be getting pneumonia.

167
00:12:38,784 --> 00:12:41,624
Me dad said
that if a man could jump like a flea,

168
00:12:41,704 --> 00:12:43,584
one leap would take him
halfway to the moon.

169
00:12:43,624 --> 00:12:47,024
Once a flea has bit a human being,
the smell of blood is too much for them.

170
00:12:47,104 --> 00:12:49,224
They're ready
for the lunatic asylum.

171
00:12:49,304 --> 00:12:51,384
They were brought over by the English,
to keep us up at night...

172
00:12:51,424 --> 00:12:53,664
and drive us
out of our wits entirely.

173
00:12:53,744 --> 00:12:56,104
Because the English knew
that the fleas,

174
00:12:56,184 --> 00:12:58,104
they multiply faster
than the Hindus.

175
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:00,464
- What's the water for, Dad?
- They do. They do!

176
00:13:00,544 --> 00:13:02,384
I wouldn't put it past the English.

177
00:13:02,464 --> 00:13:05,184
St. Patrick drove the snakes out of
Ireland; the English brought the fleas.

178
00:13:05,224 --> 00:13:07,984
And the damp.

179
00:13:08,064 --> 00:13:09,864
We loved our dad's stories.

180
00:13:19,024 --> 00:13:21,864
Hey, wait a minute.
I need some coal.

181
00:13:21,944 --> 00:13:24,344
I've got a docket here
from St. Vincent de Paul.

182
00:13:27,664 --> 00:13:29,544
Mister, please.

183
00:13:41,024 --> 00:13:44,224
Francis. Fra-
put that down.

184
00:13:44,304 --> 00:13:46,184
Don't pick coal
off the road.

185
00:13:46,264 --> 00:13:48,184
We're not beggars.

186
00:13:52,784 --> 00:13:54,744
It's terrible. Look.

187
00:13:54,784 --> 00:13:56,704
No pride, Frankie.

188
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:01,464
Come on!

189
00:14:06,184 --> 00:14:08,504
I can't believe you.

190
00:14:08,544 --> 00:14:10,904
This baby's sick,
and he needs a hot drink.

191
00:14:10,944 --> 00:14:15,544
Now, if you're too grand
to pick coal off the road, I'm not.

192
00:14:19,784 --> 00:14:22,224
Frankie. Malachy!

193
00:14:39,064 --> 00:14:41,784
Okay, come on. Let's go.

194
00:14:43,664 --> 00:14:45,504
Oh, shit!

195
00:14:49,224 --> 00:14:51,424
Malachy, come on.

196
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:08,744
Angela, come on.

197
00:15:14,344 --> 00:15:16,224
It's a rabbit she is,
that Angela.

198
00:15:16,264 --> 00:15:19,584
I don't see why we should
be paying for her mistakes.

199
00:15:19,624 --> 00:15:22,744
Five born and one gone and so useless
she can't even scrub a floor.

200
00:15:22,784 --> 00:15:25,064
Go easy with the sugar.
We're not millionaires.

201
00:15:25,144 --> 00:15:27,104
She was always angry, was Aunt Aggie.

202
00:15:27,184 --> 00:15:30,624
Me dad said it was a good thing she
didn't own the stable in Bethlehem...

203
00:15:30,704 --> 00:15:34,744
or the Holy Family would be wandering
the world still crumbling with hunger.

204
00:15:34,824 --> 00:15:37,024
I swear the skinny fella's
the image of his father.

205
00:15:37,064 --> 00:15:39,864
Aye, with the odd look
and the sour puss and all.

206
00:15:39,904 --> 00:15:43,704
I think this fella likes me.
'Tis Al Jolson he thinks I am.

207
00:15:43,744 --> 00:15:45,744
I think we'll keep
this little fella.

208
00:15:45,824 --> 00:15:48,784
- No, he's our brother!
- That's Eugene.

209
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:51,304
- You can't keep him.
- Don't bother.

210
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:54,904
I wouldn't want anything that was half
Limerick and half North of Ireland.

211
00:15:54,944 --> 00:15:58,904
- You should be so lucky.
- Don't worry. I'll have me own someday.

212
00:15:58,944 --> 00:16:01,184
If I have to crawI to Lourdes
on me two bended knees.

213
00:16:01,224 --> 00:16:04,344
Oh, did you bang your foot?
Show me your foot.

214
00:16:29,584 --> 00:16:32,864
I'll go down to Thompsons
the undertakers...

215
00:16:32,904 --> 00:16:37,224
to see about the coffi n
and the carriage.

216
00:16:37,304 --> 00:16:41,144
The St. Vincent de Paul Society
will surely pay for that.

217
00:16:41,224 --> 00:16:43,104
God knows.

218
00:16:59,464 --> 00:17:01,344
Oh, son.

219
00:17:39,904 --> 00:17:42,544
Jesus, I said to meself,
I have so much gas in my system,

220
00:17:42,624 --> 00:17:44,544
'tis a great pity
to waste it.

221
00:17:44,624 --> 00:17:47,784
So I shove a pipe up my arse,
light a match to it...

222
00:17:47,864 --> 00:17:51,184
and there I have a fine flame
ready to boiI water in any billy can.

223
00:17:51,264 --> 00:17:53,383
The English come from trenches...

224
00:17:53,463 --> 00:17:55,983
to pay me any amount of money
to boiI their water.

225
00:17:56,063 --> 00:17:58,183
That's no story to be telling
in the presence of a dead child.

226
00:17:58,263 --> 00:18:01,703
'Tis better than sitting
with a long face.

227
00:18:01,783 --> 00:18:05,503
I made so much money in the trenches
that I was able to bribe the generals,

228
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:08,663
who didn't normally
give a fiddler's fart about the Irish,

229
00:18:08,743 --> 00:18:11,703
to let me out of the army,
and off I went to Paris,

230
00:18:11,743 --> 00:18:13,623
where I had a fine time
drinking wine...

231
00:18:13,663 --> 00:18:16,703
with the models and artists
and talkin' the lingo.

232
00:18:19,743 --> 00:18:22,543
You think that's funny, do you?
I had a great time over there.

233
00:19:01,783 --> 00:19:05,823
Requiem aeternam dona ei,
Domine, et luxperpetua luceat ei.

234
00:19:05,903 --> 00:19:08,383
Requiescat in pace.

235
00:19:08,463 --> 00:19:11,743
Anima eius, et anime omnium
fidelium defunctorum,

236
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:15,663
per misericordiam Dei,
requiescant in pacem.

237
00:19:15,743 --> 00:19:19,583
In nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti.

238
00:19:19,663 --> 00:19:22,383
Amen.

239
00:19:42,863 --> 00:19:46,543
I don't know why we can't keep Oliver.

240
00:19:46,623 --> 00:19:49,463
I don't know why they sent him
away in a box like my sister.

241
00:19:53,183 --> 00:19:55,783
It's not right.

242
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:59,423
I wish I could say something
to someone.

243
00:20:12,383 --> 00:20:15,263
Dad said he was going
to the Labor Exchange to get the dole.

244
00:20:15,343 --> 00:20:18,863
He'd be home by noon, he said,
and he'd have rashers and eggs and tea.

245
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:27,783
He wasn't home by noon...

246
00:20:27,863 --> 00:20:29,783
- or 1.00...
- On your feet.

247
00:20:29,863 --> 00:20:32,263
or 2.00...

248
00:20:32,343 --> 00:20:37,023
or anytime before the sun
went down that day in May.

249
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:46,183
Fight! Fight!

250
00:20:46,263 --> 00:20:48,943
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

251
00:21:02,383 --> 00:21:05,223
Come here. Stop! Quit that now!
Quit! Stop, I said!

252
00:21:05,303 --> 00:21:07,143
Quit now!

253
00:21:07,223 --> 00:21:09,503
You little hooligan.

254
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:12,183
Is that the kind of behavior
you brought from America? Is it?

255
00:21:12,223 --> 00:21:15,023
Well, you come on with me.

256
00:21:15,103 --> 00:21:17,183
I'll put the fighting
out of you, boy.

257
00:21:17,263 --> 00:21:19,863
My little
Yankee Doodle Dandy.

258
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:22,743
The masters at Leamy's
SchooI all have straps and sticks.

259
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:25,703
They hit you if you don't know
that God made the world,

260
00:21:25,783 --> 00:21:27,743
or if you don't know
the patron saint of Limerick.

261
00:21:27,823 --> 00:21:29,743
They hit you if you can't say
the HaiI Maryin Irish...

262
00:21:29,823 --> 00:21:31,863
or if you can't ask
for the lavatory pass in Irish.

263
00:21:31,903 --> 00:21:35,303
They hit you if you laugh,
if you're late, if you talk.

264
00:21:35,383 --> 00:21:37,543
One master will hit you if you
don't know that Eamon De Valera...

265
00:21:37,623 --> 00:21:39,743
was the greatest man
that ever lived.

266
00:21:39,823 --> 00:21:41,823
Another will hit you if you don't know
that MichaeI Collins...

267
00:21:41,903 --> 00:21:43,823
was the greatest man
that ever lived.

268
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:46,543
McCourt.

269
00:22:05,463 --> 00:22:09,943
You're a bad Yank, McCourt.
What are you?

270
00:22:09,983 --> 00:22:14,143
They said we were cowboys
and gangsters, sir.

271
00:22:14,223 --> 00:22:16,463
- I was only joking, sir.
- No more jokes.

272
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,543
- It's not their fault they're Yanks.
- T'isn't, sir.

273
00:22:18,623 --> 00:22:21,423
You should go down
on your two knees every night...

274
00:22:21,503 --> 00:22:24,223
and give thanks to God
that you're not a Yank.

275
00:22:24,303 --> 00:22:27,343
If you were, Al Capone himself would be
coming to you for instruction.

276
00:22:35,543 --> 00:22:38,103
I know Oliver is dead.

277
00:22:38,183 --> 00:22:40,423
Malachy knows
Oliver is dead,

278
00:22:40,503 --> 00:22:44,263
but little Eugene is only two
and too small to know anything.

279
00:22:44,343 --> 00:22:46,183
Malachy and I make him laugh,

280
00:22:46,263 --> 00:22:48,103
pull faces,
put pots on our heads,

281
00:22:48,183 --> 00:22:51,503
take him to the park,
show him the flowers.

282
00:22:51,583 --> 00:22:56,263
Me dad says Eugene is lucky to have
such brothers like me and Malachy.

283
00:23:10,783 --> 00:23:12,623
He died anyway.

284
00:23:12,703 --> 00:23:14,543
Ma.

285
00:23:26,183 --> 00:23:29,543
Please, God,

286
00:23:29,623 --> 00:23:32,263
is this what you want, is it?

287
00:23:32,343 --> 00:23:36,343
I'm not supposed
to question this, am I?

288
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:42,903
You took my son, Oliver.

289
00:23:42,943 --> 00:23:45,503
You took his brother, Eugene.

290
00:23:46,943 --> 00:23:50,103
You took their beautiful
wee sister, Margaret Mary.

291
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:56,223
Dear God above,

292
00:23:56,303 --> 00:23:59,823
why do you want
the wee children to die?

293
00:24:14,263 --> 00:24:18,303
Please, God, don't let Malachy
and me and the rest of us...

294
00:24:18,383 --> 00:24:22,303
be taken off in the box
for the hole in the ground.

295
00:24:22,383 --> 00:24:25,823
Or even Aunt Aggie
or Mr. Benson at Leamy's School.

296
00:24:25,903 --> 00:24:30,343
In the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Toast.

297
00:25:15,943 --> 00:25:17,863
Be going
in a minute, son.

298
00:25:17,943 --> 00:25:20,223
No, that's Eugene's coffin.

299
00:25:20,263 --> 00:25:22,623
I'll tell mam you put your pint
on Eugene's coffin.

300
00:25:22,663 --> 00:25:25,783
- Have another pint, mister.
- Will you wait outside a few minutes?

301
00:25:25,863 --> 00:25:27,903
- No!
- Jesus, if that was my son,

302
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:30,583
I'd kick his arse
from here to County Kerry.

303
00:25:30,663 --> 00:25:34,663
I mean, if a man can't have a pint
on the day of a funeraI,

304
00:25:34,743 --> 00:25:36,623
what use
is living at all?

305
00:26:13,623 --> 00:26:17,983
I couldn't have spent
another minute in that room.

306
00:26:18,023 --> 00:26:21,463
I saw me little twins
morning, noon and night.

307
00:26:21,543 --> 00:26:24,343
If we hadn't have moved,
I'd have gone out of my mind...

308
00:26:24,423 --> 00:26:26,823
and ended up
in the lunatic asylum.

309
00:26:30,503 --> 00:26:35,183
I'm sorry, but it was
only five months ago.

310
00:26:35,263 --> 00:26:39,783
And before that,
I lost my little girl in New York.

311
00:26:39,863 --> 00:26:43,383
And I've the two boys here
and I've one on the way.

312
00:26:43,463 --> 00:26:45,503
Ah, now, missus,
sit down, will you?

313
00:26:45,543 --> 00:26:47,423
Thanks.

314
00:26:50,823 --> 00:26:52,863
That's a nice coat
you're wearing.

315
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:56,743
It was given to me
by my cousin in Brooklyn. It's not new.

316
00:26:57,783 --> 00:27:00,663
McCourt. That's not
a Limerick name.

317
00:27:00,743 --> 00:27:02,703
Where'd you get
a name like that?

318
00:27:02,783 --> 00:27:04,703
My husband, sir.
He's from the North.

319
00:27:04,743 --> 00:27:08,023
Why don't you go to Belfast and see
what they can do for you up there?

320
00:27:10,343 --> 00:27:12,503
I don't know, sir.

321
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:14,423
Of course you don't know.

322
00:27:14,503 --> 00:27:16,383
There's great ignorance
in the world.

323
00:27:16,463 --> 00:27:18,463
I said there's a great deal
of ignorance in the world.

324
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:24,983
And what do you want
from us?

325
00:27:25,063 --> 00:27:28,063
There isn't a stick of furniture
in the new place.

326
00:27:28,143 --> 00:27:32,783
- Does your husband have a job?
- No, sir, he's on the dole.

327
00:27:36,423 --> 00:27:39,583
We'll give you a docket
for a table, two chairs and two beds.

328
00:27:39,623 --> 00:27:42,503
You can take it to the second hand
furniture shop in Irish town.

329
00:27:42,543 --> 00:27:45,463
Excuse me, sir,
but will the beds be second hand?

330
00:27:45,543 --> 00:27:47,783
Of course they will.

331
00:27:47,863 --> 00:27:50,543
I'm worried about sleeping
in beds people might have died in.

332
00:27:50,623 --> 00:27:52,543
Especially if they died
of the consumption.

333
00:27:52,583 --> 00:27:56,463
Beggars can't be choosers,
Mrs. McCourt.

334
00:27:59,543 --> 00:28:02,023
Thanks.

335
00:28:53,143 --> 00:28:55,663
I should say
it's a good fire.

336
00:28:57,743 --> 00:28:59,743
Could it be true

337
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:02,023
Hey, hey,
that's my wife.

338
00:29:02,063 --> 00:29:03,943
Someone like you

339
00:29:03,983 --> 00:29:06,783
Who's he?

340
00:29:06,823 --> 00:29:11,263
That, Francis,
is Pope Leo XIII,

341
00:29:11,343 --> 00:29:14,023
and he was a great friend
of the working man.

342
00:29:14,063 --> 00:29:17,223
You know, I found this in an alley
in Brooklyn in someone's rubbish.

343
00:29:17,303 --> 00:29:20,063
No doubt thrown away by some eejit
that had no time for the working man.

344
00:29:20,103 --> 00:29:22,023
Ugh, what's that stink?

345
00:29:22,063 --> 00:29:25,543
Hey, what are you doing?

346
00:29:25,623 --> 00:29:27,743
Why are you emptying your bucket
in our lavatory?

347
00:29:27,783 --> 00:29:31,423
Your lavatory, mister? Ah, no.
I think you're mistaken there.

348
00:29:31,463 --> 00:29:33,503
This here is the lavatory
for the whole lane, it is.

349
00:29:33,583 --> 00:29:36,783
The buckets of 11 families
get flushed down here every day.

350
00:29:36,863 --> 00:29:39,143
And it gets fairly powerful here
in the warm weather.

351
00:29:39,223 --> 00:29:41,343
So powerful you'll be
calling for a gas mask.

352
00:29:41,383 --> 00:29:43,623
So, good night to you.
Missus.

353
00:29:43,703 --> 00:29:45,783
I hope you'll be happy
in the house.

354
00:29:45,863 --> 00:29:49,103
Thanks very much.

355
00:29:49,263 --> 00:29:53,063
And there was this big man,
and he came along and he met this woman,

356
00:29:53,143 --> 00:29:56,143
and he grew a big huge beard
all over her face,

357
00:29:56,223 --> 00:29:58,663
and then they got married.

358
00:30:16,623 --> 00:30:18,503
Have we moved again,
Frankie?

359
00:30:18,543 --> 00:30:20,903
No, they wouldn't go
without the Pope.

360
00:30:36,903 --> 00:30:41,383
Oh,Jesus, look at the state ofyouse.
Couple of drowning rats.

361
00:30:41,463 --> 00:30:43,263
Get your wet clothes off,
dry yourself by the fire,

362
00:30:43,303 --> 00:30:46,503
and say hello
to your brother Michael.

363
00:30:48,503 --> 00:30:50,343
He's fatter
than the Baby Jesus.

364
00:30:50,423 --> 00:30:53,703
He's the spitting image of your dead
little sister...

365
00:30:53,743 --> 00:30:56,823
with the lovely blue eyes
and the gorgeous eyebrows.

366
00:30:56,903 --> 00:30:58,743
Why are we
all upstairs?

367
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:02,463
The downstairs is full of the damp.
It's killing us one by one.

368
00:31:02,503 --> 00:31:05,503
That lavatory could kill us
with every class of disease.

369
00:31:05,583 --> 00:31:08,023
It was the Limerick damp
that killed your wee brothers.

370
00:31:08,103 --> 00:31:10,823
We'll be dry up here for now.
We'll go downstairs for the spring.

371
00:31:10,903 --> 00:31:13,463
It's like going away on holiday
to a nice, warm, foreign place,

372
00:31:13,543 --> 00:31:15,383
like- like Italy.

373
00:31:15,463 --> 00:31:17,303
- Italy?
- Aye, we could be in Sorrento.

374
00:31:17,383 --> 00:31:19,263
Calcutta, more like.

375
00:31:19,343 --> 00:31:22,983
- What about the Pope?
- He can stay downstairs in Ireland.

376
00:31:23,063 --> 00:31:26,743
Will you look at the state
of those children's shoes?

377
00:31:26,823 --> 00:31:28,743
I can't go to the St. Vincent's
for boots.

378
00:31:28,823 --> 00:31:31,943
I'm too weak to be standing
in the queue.

379
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:35,303
There was a woman who had triplets
waiting forever in that queue.

380
00:31:35,343 --> 00:31:38,343
Have you no pride, Angela,
begging like that?

381
00:31:38,423 --> 00:31:41,063
What would you do,
Mr. Grand Manner?

382
00:31:41,143 --> 00:31:43,103
You'd let them go barefoot
before you got off your arse,

383
00:31:43,143 --> 00:31:44,583
useless feck that you are.

384
00:31:49,103 --> 00:31:50,423
Right.

385
00:31:50,503 --> 00:31:52,383
Useless feck, is it?

386
00:31:52,423 --> 00:31:54,303
We'll see.

387
00:32:15,063 --> 00:32:16,903
It's poor I am.

388
00:32:20,383 --> 00:32:22,663
It's unlucky I am.

389
00:32:28,183 --> 00:32:30,143
But it's useless...

390
00:32:34,343 --> 00:32:35,943
I'm not.

391
00:32:49,023 --> 00:32:51,703
Look at those shoes!

392
00:33:29,423 --> 00:33:31,423
- Where are your shoes?
- Don't know, sir.

393
00:33:31,503 --> 00:33:34,063
Of course you know, boy.
Where are they?

394
00:33:34,143 --> 00:33:36,823
Did your mommy not put
on your shoes this morning?

395
00:33:36,903 --> 00:33:39,383
Did you come to schooI
without shoes, did you?

396
00:33:39,463 --> 00:33:42,863
How many times have you been told about
walking the streets in your bare feet?

397
00:33:42,943 --> 00:33:46,103
By God, I'll boot
the bare feet out of you, boy.

398
00:33:54,023 --> 00:33:56,023
Put them on, boy.

399
00:34:01,543 --> 00:34:04,063
Quiet!

400
00:34:04,143 --> 00:34:07,263
Do I hear sneering
in this class?

401
00:34:07,303 --> 00:34:10,463
Do I hear jeering
at another's misfortune?

402
00:34:10,543 --> 00:34:13,583
Is there any boy in this class
who thinks he's perfect?

403
00:34:13,663 --> 00:34:16,623
If so, raise your hands.

404
00:34:16,703 --> 00:34:20,223
Is there any boy here now who has money
galore to be spending on shoes?

405
00:34:20,263 --> 00:34:22,623
Raise your hands.

406
00:34:22,703 --> 00:34:25,143
No.

407
00:34:25,223 --> 00:34:29,343
There are boys in this class
who have no shoes at all,

408
00:34:29,423 --> 00:34:32,863
and it's not
their fault.

409
00:34:32,943 --> 00:34:34,783
It's not their shame.

410
00:34:34,863 --> 00:34:37,423
Our Lord had no shoes.

411
00:34:37,503 --> 00:34:41,623
He died shoeless.

412
00:34:41,703 --> 00:34:45,943
You don't see Him
hanging on the cross sporting shoes.

413
00:34:46,023 --> 00:34:49,103
- Do you, boys?
- No, sir!

414
00:34:49,183 --> 00:34:51,023
What is it you don't see
Our Lord doing?

415
00:34:51,103 --> 00:34:54,463
Hanging on the cross
sporting shoes.

416
00:34:54,543 --> 00:34:57,343
"Hanging on the cross
sporting shoes," what?

417
00:34:57,383 --> 00:35:01,463
Hanging on the cross
sporting shoes, sir.

418
00:35:03,303 --> 00:35:07,023
Everyday,
me dad would look for a job,

419
00:35:07,103 --> 00:35:09,823
- somehow, he never seemed to get one.
- We've enough for today.

420
00:35:09,863 --> 00:35:13,303
- Mam said it was his Northern accent.
- No work here. Sorry.

421
00:35:13,383 --> 00:35:17,863
Grandma said it was because
of his funny manner.

422
00:35:30,063 --> 00:35:33,783
Me dad knew those
lanes like the back of his hand.

423
00:35:33,863 --> 00:35:36,543
He walked them often enough
when he couldn't get work...

424
00:35:36,583 --> 00:35:39,303
and was too ashamed
to come home to me mam.

425
00:35:43,623 --> 00:35:46,063
That's why
we loved Easter.

426
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:49,943
Because it was at Easter
that me dad got his first job.

427
00:35:54,823 --> 00:35:57,543
The dipsy doodle
is the thing to beware

428
00:35:57,623 --> 00:36:00,263
The dipsy doodle
is gonna get in your hair

429
00:36:00,343 --> 00:36:02,943
And if it gets to you
it couldn't be worse

430
00:36:02,983 --> 00:36:05,663
The things you say
will all come out in reverse

431
00:36:05,743 --> 00:36:08,063
Don't go
up the mine, Manny

432
00:36:08,143 --> 00:36:10,823
That's the way
the dipsy doodle works

433
00:36:10,903 --> 00:36:12,943
The dipsy doodle
is a way to do fine

434
00:36:13,023 --> 00:36:16,223
It's almost always
at the back of your mind

435
00:36:16,303 --> 00:36:19,343
You never know it's there
untiI it's too late

436
00:36:19,423 --> 00:36:21,463
And then you get
in such a terrible state

437
00:36:21,543 --> 00:36:23,663
Will you stop it?

438
00:36:23,743 --> 00:36:26,103
Maybe if you weren't
strangling me, I'd be fine.

439
00:36:26,183 --> 00:36:29,583
- Stop it.
- When you think you're crazy

440
00:36:29,663 --> 00:36:32,863
It was only
at the Limerick Cement Factory,

441
00:36:32,903 --> 00:36:35,023
but he still wore
a collar and tie.

442
00:36:35,103 --> 00:36:38,503
He said a man without a tie
had no respect for himself.

443
00:36:48,943 --> 00:36:51,383
Come on.

444
00:37:02,823 --> 00:37:07,063
In Mount joy jaiI

445
00:37:07,143 --> 00:37:09,983
One Monday morning

446
00:37:10,023 --> 00:37:14,743
High upon the gallows tree

447
00:37:14,823 --> 00:37:18,903
Kevin Barry
gave his young life

448
00:37:18,983 --> 00:37:22,583
For the cause
of liberty

449
00:37:22,663 --> 00:37:24,543
For Jesus' sake,
put a sockin it!

450
00:37:24,623 --> 00:37:26,983
Some of us have to go
to feckin' work in the morning!

451
00:37:27,063 --> 00:37:31,743
Yet there's
no one can deny

452
00:37:31,783 --> 00:37:35,383
As he walked to death
that morning

453
00:37:35,463 --> 00:37:38,623
He proudly
held his head

454
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:45,143
His head up high

455
00:37:51,223 --> 00:37:53,623
Francis! Malachy!

456
00:38:00,423 --> 00:38:03,263
Come down here, boys.
I have the Friday penny for you.

457
00:38:03,303 --> 00:38:06,103
No. Be quiet.

458
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:09,823
Up, boys!

459
00:38:09,863 --> 00:38:13,663
Those Red Branch Knights!

460
00:38:13,703 --> 00:38:15,983
Those Fenian men!

461
00:38:16,063 --> 00:38:18,903
The glorious I.R.A.!

462
00:38:18,983 --> 00:38:22,623
Up! Up! Up!

463
00:38:43,023 --> 00:38:46,623
I have the Friday penny
for you, boys.

464
00:38:46,703 --> 00:38:48,663
You line up
like soldiers now,

465
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:51,823
and promise to die
for Ireland.

466
00:38:51,903 --> 00:38:55,263
- I don't want it.
- I don't want it either.

467
00:39:00,583 --> 00:39:02,463
Damn!

468
00:39:07,623 --> 00:39:09,583
When we woke up the next morning,

469
00:39:09,663 --> 00:39:11,503
he was still asleep.

470
00:39:11,583 --> 00:39:13,823
He missed work
and lost his job.

471
00:39:34,983 --> 00:39:37,503
And what do I have here,
Clohessy?

472
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:40,063
Strips of newspaper, sir.

473
00:39:40,223 --> 00:39:42,703
And what do they
represent, Clohessy?

474
00:39:42,783 --> 00:39:44,743
Pieces of
the Limerick Leader, sir.

475
00:39:44,823 --> 00:39:47,063
No!

476
00:39:47,103 --> 00:39:49,943
The body and blood
of Christ.

477
00:39:49,983 --> 00:39:52,303
If you don't pay more attention,
it'll be the Last Rites...

478
00:39:52,383 --> 00:39:54,503
you'll be getting,
not your Holy Communion.

479
00:39:56,943 --> 00:39:59,663
Irish is the language
of patriots...

480
00:39:59,743 --> 00:40:03,423
and English
of traitors and informers.

481
00:40:03,463 --> 00:40:06,223
But Latin-
ah, boys, Latin-

482
00:40:06,303 --> 00:40:09,183
that the Holy Martyrs
spoke before expiring...

483
00:40:09,263 --> 00:40:11,943
in the foaming mouths
of ravenous lions.

484
00:40:12,023 --> 00:40:16,263
Yes, it's Latin that gains
entrance to heaven itself.

485
00:40:16,343 --> 00:40:18,143
But there are boys
in this class...

486
00:40:18,223 --> 00:40:21,983
who will never know
Sanctifying Grace.

487
00:40:22,023 --> 00:40:24,663
And why?
Because of greed.

488
00:40:24,703 --> 00:40:27,903
Those greedy little black guards
are talking even now...

489
00:40:27,943 --> 00:40:31,383
about the money they'll
get from the Collection.

490
00:40:31,423 --> 00:40:36,023
They'll go from house to house
in their little suits like beggars.

491
00:40:36,063 --> 00:40:37,943
And will they take
any of that money...

492
00:40:37,983 --> 00:40:42,703
and send it to the poor black babies
in Africa as they should?

493
00:40:42,783 --> 00:40:44,823
Oh, no.

494
00:40:44,863 --> 00:40:49,543
It's off to the cinema
the First Communion boys will go...

495
00:40:49,623 --> 00:40:54,263
to wallow
in the disgusting filth...

496
00:40:54,303 --> 00:40:59,063
spewed across the world
by the devil's henchmen...

497
00:40:59,103 --> 00:41:01,823
in Hollywood.

498
00:41:01,863 --> 00:41:04,823
- Isn't that right, McCourt?
- 'Tis, sir.

499
00:41:04,863 --> 00:41:08,583
Don't speak, you! Can't you see
that God is on your tongue?

500
00:41:08,663 --> 00:41:11,703
Where is God, boys?

501
00:41:11,743 --> 00:41:14,463
On his tongue, sir.

502
00:41:14,503 --> 00:41:16,383
On his tongue.

503
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:21,783
My friend, Mikey Molloy,

504
00:41:21,823 --> 00:41:23,743
tells us all about
how much money we'll make...

505
00:41:23,783 --> 00:41:25,703
at the Collection
after our First Communion,

506
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:27,663
when we all knock
on the neighbors' doors...

507
00:41:27,743 --> 00:41:30,783
and get as much as five shillings
for sweets and cakes...

508
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:33,303
and even go to the Lyric Cinema
to see James Cagney.

509
00:41:33,383 --> 00:41:36,583
- I seen it three times.
- What happens in it?

510
00:41:36,663 --> 00:41:40,343
Also, Mikey is the expert
in the lane on girls' bodies...

511
00:41:40,383 --> 00:41:42,503
and dirty things
in generaI.

512
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,263
Now, on top, the girls
have great floppy things called titties.

513
00:41:45,343 --> 00:41:48,663
And at the end of them,
great red things like dogs' noses.

514
00:41:48,743 --> 00:41:52,463
And down at the bottom-
Now that's an entirely different matter.

515
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:56,223
- They don't have a mickey down there.
- What do they have?

516
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:58,743
I can tell you, but I don't think
he should hear it.

517
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,663
Malachy, go away.

518
00:42:02,983 --> 00:42:05,903
Eww! Yuck!

519
00:42:12,903 --> 00:42:16,223
Oh, look, I'll take
one of these as well.

520
00:42:43,743 --> 00:42:47,463
In the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.

521
00:42:47,543 --> 00:42:50,703
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
This is my first confession.

522
00:42:50,783 --> 00:42:54,383
Yes, my child.
And what sins have you committed?

523
00:42:54,463 --> 00:42:56,543
I told a lie,
I hit my brother,

524
00:42:56,583 --> 00:42:59,023
I stole a penny
from my mother's purse,

525
00:42:59,103 --> 00:43:00,983
and I ate a sausage
on Friday.

526
00:43:01,023 --> 00:43:03,183
Yes, my child,
anything else?

527
00:43:03,263 --> 00:43:06,063
I listened to dirty things
about girls from the lanes...

528
00:43:06,143 --> 00:43:08,423
who don't care what they do
because they-

529
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:11,303
because they've already
done it with their brothers.

530
00:43:11,383 --> 00:43:14,903
And who told you these things?

531
00:43:14,943 --> 00:43:17,503
- Mikey Molloy, Father.
- Hmm.

532
00:43:17,583 --> 00:43:20,863
For your penance, say three HaiI Marys,
three Our Fathers,

533
00:43:20,903 --> 00:43:23,103
and say a speciaI
prayer for me.

534
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:25,103
Am I one of the worst boys,
Father?

535
00:43:25,183 --> 00:43:28,023
No, mychild.
You have a long way to go.

536
00:43:30,823 --> 00:43:33,423
Wake up! Wake up!

537
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:36,823
His First Communion,
the happiest day of his life,

538
00:43:36,903 --> 00:43:38,783
and the lot of you
still snoring in there.

539
00:43:38,823 --> 00:43:42,143
Here, you two,
get up. Go on.

540
00:43:42,183 --> 00:43:44,743
Look at him.
A bar of soap wouldn't be lost on him.

541
00:43:44,823 --> 00:43:46,703
I'll be red raw.

542
00:43:46,783 --> 00:43:49,023
I swear it's
the Northern Ireland in you.

543
00:43:49,063 --> 00:43:50,943
It attracts the dirt.

544
00:43:50,983 --> 00:43:53,103
You've the dirty gob
of your father.

545
00:43:53,183 --> 00:43:54,823
Aah! That's cold.

546
00:43:54,903 --> 00:43:57,263
Jesus, you have enough dirt
in your ears...

547
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,903
to grow potatoes.

548
00:43:59,943 --> 00:44:03,943
Will you look at that mop?
It won't lie down.

549
00:44:04,023 --> 00:44:06,743
You didn't get this hair
from our side of the family.

550
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:09,623
This is North of Ireland hair
you got from your father.

551
00:44:09,663 --> 00:44:13,023
It's like- like what
you'd see on a Presbyterian.

552
00:44:15,543 --> 00:44:17,623
Will you stop
spitting on me?

553
00:44:17,663 --> 00:44:20,063
A little spit
won't kill you.

554
00:44:20,143 --> 00:44:23,663
If your mother had married a proper,
decent Limerick man,

555
00:44:23,743 --> 00:44:26,783
you wouldn't have stand-up,
North of Ireland, Protestant hair.

556
00:44:26,823 --> 00:44:28,703
And we wouldn't be late.

557
00:44:45,063 --> 00:44:48,343
Corpus Christi.

558
00:44:50,783 --> 00:44:53,303
Corpus Christi.

559
00:44:57,463 --> 00:44:59,703
Corpus Christi.

560
00:45:04,903 --> 00:45:07,583
Will you stop your clucking
and get back to your seat?

561
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:11,383
Corpus Christi.

562
00:45:19,463 --> 00:45:21,943
Mam, can I go now
and make the Collection?

563
00:45:22,023 --> 00:45:24,663
I want to go to the Lyric
to see James Cagney.

564
00:45:24,703 --> 00:45:26,383
You can't make the Collection
untiI you've had...

565
00:45:26,463 --> 00:45:28,503
a proper First Communion breakfast
at my house.

566
00:45:28,583 --> 00:45:30,063
Mam.

567
00:45:41,143 --> 00:45:43,503
Will you look at him?
The manners of a pig.

568
00:45:43,583 --> 00:45:45,463
He eats like a Presbyterian.

569
00:45:45,543 --> 00:45:49,303
Is it a millionaire you think I am?
An American?

570
00:45:49,343 --> 00:45:51,383
Is there any more tea
in the pot, Mam?

571
00:45:51,423 --> 00:45:53,903
- Aye.
- I could do with a cup.

572
00:45:53,983 --> 00:45:56,703
You allright, Frankie?

573
00:45:56,743 --> 00:46:00,223
- What's the matter, Frankie?
- What's wrong with that child?

574
00:46:03,223 --> 00:46:06,463
Look what he did! He's thrown up
the body and blood of Jesus.

575
00:46:06,503 --> 00:46:10,263
What am I to do?
I have God in me backyard!

576
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:19,183
I'm taking you
to the priest.

577
00:46:19,263 --> 00:46:21,823
That was a dreadful thing
you did in my backyard.

578
00:46:25,503 --> 00:46:28,103
In the name of The Father
and of The Son and of the Holy Ghost.

579
00:46:28,183 --> 00:46:30,023
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

580
00:46:30,103 --> 00:46:31,943
It's been a day
since my last confession.

581
00:46:32,023 --> 00:46:33,863
A day?

582
00:46:33,943 --> 00:46:36,423
And what sins have you committed
in a day, my son?

583
00:46:36,503 --> 00:46:39,463
I overslept, and I nearly missed
my First Communion.

584
00:46:39,543 --> 00:46:41,663
My hair stuck up
like a Protestant's,

585
00:46:41,743 --> 00:46:44,343
and I threw up my First
Holy Communion breakfast.

586
00:46:44,383 --> 00:46:48,543
Now me grandma says she has God
in her backyard and what shall she do?

587
00:46:48,583 --> 00:46:52,383
Tell your grandma to wash it away
with a little water.

588
00:46:55,463 --> 00:46:57,663
Holy water
or ordinary water?

589
00:46:57,703 --> 00:47:00,543
- He didn't say, Grandma.
- Well, go back and ask him.

590
00:47:06,943 --> 00:47:10,303
In the name of The Father
and of The Son and of The Holy Ghost.

591
00:47:10,383 --> 00:47:12,223
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

592
00:47:12,303 --> 00:47:14,583
It's been a minute
since my last confession.

593
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:17,143
A minute? Are you the boy
that was just here?

594
00:47:17,183 --> 00:47:20,503
- I am, Father.
- What is it now?

595
00:47:20,543 --> 00:47:24,303
My grandma says holy water
or ordinary water?

596
00:47:27,423 --> 00:47:30,463
He says ordinary water,
and don't go bothering him again.

597
00:47:30,503 --> 00:47:32,263
Bothering him?

598
00:47:32,343 --> 00:47:35,183
Well, the ignorant
old bog trotter.

599
00:47:37,383 --> 00:47:40,783
There wasn't anytime
for the Collection. Not a penny.

600
00:47:40,863 --> 00:47:43,383
So Mikey Molloy pretended
to have one of his fits...

601
00:47:43,463 --> 00:47:46,143
so that I could slip in
when no one was looking.

602
00:47:46,183 --> 00:47:48,303
- Missus, quick, He's having a fit!
- Is he all right?

603
00:47:48,383 --> 00:47:50,263
Mr. O'Brien, quick!

604
00:47:54,503 --> 00:47:57,463
Watch he doesn't
swallow his tongue.

605
00:47:57,543 --> 00:48:01,663
Does anyone know what to do?

606
00:48:01,703 --> 00:48:05,503
- No, don't. I'll do anything.
- Oh, no, you won't.

607
00:48:05,543 --> 00:48:07,703
You've had your last chance.
You can take this with you.

608
00:48:07,743 --> 00:48:10,503
Shoot him!

609
00:48:10,583 --> 00:48:13,183
All you
had to do was bump me off.

610
00:48:17,623 --> 00:48:20,343
- Do you want a toffee?
- Thanks.

611
00:48:24,863 --> 00:48:26,743
I'm glad I did the First Communion.

612
00:48:26,823 --> 00:48:29,583
I'm glad I got my First Confession
over and done with.

613
00:48:29,663 --> 00:48:33,903
Now I'm free to grow up.
Old enough to be ten, anyway.

614
00:48:33,943 --> 00:48:37,143
Old enough to pay the ultimate penance
for growing up.

615
00:48:37,223 --> 00:48:39,143
Worse than joining
the army or the police...

616
00:48:39,223 --> 00:48:42,503
or going to Australia
or becoming a nun in Africa.

617
00:48:42,583 --> 00:48:45,823
Worse than that,
I had to learn Irish dancing.

618
00:48:45,903 --> 00:48:49,943
I don't want to learn it.
Ow. What did you do that for?

619
00:48:50,023 --> 00:48:52,143
Just don't want to learn
how to dance.

620
00:48:52,183 --> 00:48:54,063
...and back and back.

621
00:48:57,383 --> 00:49:01,103
Up and back
and one, two.

622
00:49:01,143 --> 00:49:03,783
Lift up your feet,
for the love of Jesus.

623
00:49:03,863 --> 00:49:07,183
One, two, three. And one, two, three.
And up and back, and one, two, three.

624
00:49:07,263 --> 00:49:09,223
And up and back,
andone, two, three.

625
00:49:09,303 --> 00:49:11,383
If my mates saw me
making a pure eejit out of meself...

626
00:49:11,463 --> 00:49:14,063
at the Irish dancing,
I'd be disgraced forever.

627
00:49:14,143 --> 00:49:16,343
I want to be Fred Astaire.

628
00:49:16,423 --> 00:49:18,823
Irish dancers look like they have
steeI rods stuck up their arses.

629
00:49:18,903 --> 00:49:21,103
Would you stop the frowning
Frankie McCourt?

630
00:49:21,183 --> 00:49:23,223
You've a face on you
like a pound of tripe.

631
00:49:23,303 --> 00:49:27,223
And up and back, and one, two, three.
And up and back, and one, two, three.

632
00:49:29,143 --> 00:49:33,743
The next time I went to dancing lessons,
I bumped into Paddy Clohessy.

633
00:49:33,823 --> 00:49:35,703
- Hi, Frankie.
- Hiya, Paddy. How you doing?

634
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:38,743
- Not too bad. You?
- Grand. Catch.

635
00:49:38,823 --> 00:49:41,823
Frankie, I'm telling you,
that dancing stuff is for sissies.

636
00:49:41,903 --> 00:49:43,783
You won't be able
to play football next.

637
00:49:43,863 --> 00:49:46,063
- I won't?
- You'll be running around girlie-like.

638
00:49:46,103 --> 00:49:48,703
- Shut up.
- Everyone will be laughing at you.

639
00:49:48,783 --> 00:49:52,663
- They will?
- Next thing, you'll be knitting socks.

640
00:50:00,503 --> 00:50:03,023
I was finished with the dancing.

641
00:50:03,103 --> 00:50:06,983
Every Saturday, my mam's sixpence
got me and Paddy into the Lyric...

642
00:50:07,063 --> 00:50:10,623
with enough left to stuff our gobs
with Cleeves' toffee.

643
00:50:18,423 --> 00:50:20,503
Yay!

644
00:50:20,583 --> 00:50:24,023
I was so happy, I didn't know whether
to shit or go blind.

645
00:50:27,383 --> 00:50:30,383
Every week, I'd take the money
and skip the dancing...

646
00:50:30,423 --> 00:50:32,303
and go to the pictures.

647
00:50:32,343 --> 00:50:34,703
When I got home,
I'd make up the dancing...

648
00:50:34,743 --> 00:50:37,303
- and pretend I had a poker up my arse.
- Well done, son.

649
00:50:38,903 --> 00:50:41,583
Hitler shows himself in his true colors.

650
00:50:41,623 --> 00:50:43,943
He marches his troops
into the Rhineland...

651
00:50:44,023 --> 00:50:46,703
in defiance of the terms
of the Treaty of Versailles.

652
00:50:49,383 --> 00:50:51,983
The swastika
spreads its eviI shadow.

653
00:50:53,983 --> 00:50:58,383
Sir, what use is Euclid when the Germans
are bombing everything in sight?

654
00:50:58,423 --> 00:51:00,823
What use is Euclid?

655
00:51:00,863 --> 00:51:02,943
Without Euclid,

656
00:51:03,023 --> 00:51:06,023
the Messerschmitt could never
have taken to the sky...

657
00:51:06,103 --> 00:51:08,263
and dart
from cloud to cloud...

658
00:51:08,343 --> 00:51:11,103
and bomb the be jesus
out of the English,

659
00:51:11,183 --> 00:51:14,423
who deserve it after what they
did to the Irish for 800 years.

660
00:51:14,503 --> 00:51:18,183
Euclid is grace
and beauty...

661
00:51:18,263 --> 00:51:20,143
and elegance.

662
00:51:20,183 --> 00:51:23,223
- Do you understand that, boys?
- We do, sir.

663
00:51:23,303 --> 00:51:26,543
- We do, sir.
- I doubt it.

664
00:51:26,623 --> 00:51:30,703
To love Euclid is to be alone
in this world.

665
00:51:30,783 --> 00:51:34,102
You. Clohessy.

666
00:51:34,182 --> 00:51:36,862
Who stood at the foot of the cross
when our Lord was crucified?

667
00:51:38,142 --> 00:51:40,342
The Twelve Apostles, sir?

668
00:51:40,422 --> 00:51:43,502
Clohessy, what is
the Irish word for fool?

669
00:51:43,582 --> 00:51:45,262
Omadhaun, sir.

670
00:51:45,342 --> 00:51:49,142
Sir. I know who stood
at the foot of the cross, sir.

671
00:51:49,222 --> 00:51:51,062
It was
the three Marys, sir.

672
00:51:51,142 --> 00:51:53,862
That's Fintan Slattery.

673
00:51:53,942 --> 00:51:56,622
He's going to be a saint
when he gets older.

674
00:51:56,702 --> 00:51:59,182
Everyone know she wears
his sister's blouse at night...

675
00:51:59,262 --> 00:52:01,262
and curls his hair
with hot iron tongs...

676
00:52:01,342 --> 00:52:04,502
so that he'll look gorgeous
at Mass on Sundays.

677
00:52:04,582 --> 00:52:06,662
It's no wonder
we played truant.

678
00:52:06,742 --> 00:52:08,462
Chickens!

679
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,542
Of all the girls I've known
and I've known some

680
00:52:10,622 --> 00:52:13,222
Untill first met you
I was lonesome

681
00:52:13,302 --> 00:52:16,342
And when you came in sight
my heart grew light

682
00:52:16,422 --> 00:52:19,302
And this old world
seemed new to me

683
00:52:19,382 --> 00:52:21,622
You're really swell
I have to admit you

684
00:52:21,702 --> 00:52:23,782
Deserve expressions
that really fit you

685
00:52:23,862 --> 00:52:26,542
Hurry up, Frankie.
I can't hold them.

686
00:52:26,582 --> 00:52:30,702
I've racked my brain hoping to explain
all the things that you do to me

687
00:52:30,742 --> 00:52:36,902
Bei mir bist du schon
please let me explain

688
00:52:36,982 --> 00:52:39,142
Frankie, there's
nothing in the world...

689
00:52:39,222 --> 00:52:41,902
like a good feed of apples
and a drink of water...

690
00:52:41,982 --> 00:52:46,022
and a good shit and plenty of grass
to wipe your arse with.

691
00:52:47,942 --> 00:52:50,382
Paddy, quick, wipe your arse.
It's milking time!

692
00:52:50,462 --> 00:52:53,022
Will you wait for me?
Frankie, wait.

693
00:52:54,902 --> 00:52:57,422
Frankie, you're doing it wrong.
You've got to pull it down.

694
00:52:57,502 --> 00:53:00,022
- You have to squeeze down.
- Shut up!

695
00:53:00,102 --> 00:53:02,582
- Shut up!
- Frankie, don't!

696
00:53:02,662 --> 00:53:06,222
- Hey, clear off, you little bastards!
- Run, Paddy, run!

697
00:53:06,302 --> 00:53:09,422
I'll give you such a kick in the hole,
you won't know what hit you.

698
00:53:09,502 --> 00:53:12,062
Here, piggy.

699
00:53:12,142 --> 00:53:14,902
Mikey Molloy persuaded
us to go to Peter Dooley's house.

700
00:53:14,982 --> 00:53:17,742
Peter Dooley has a hump like
the one Charles Laughton had...

701
00:53:17,822 --> 00:53:20,142
in The Hunchback of Notre Dame.

702
00:53:20,182 --> 00:53:21,622
That's why they call him
Quasimodo.

703
00:53:21,662 --> 00:53:26,382
Oh, and he has these four sisters
with the enormous breasts.

704
00:53:28,342 --> 00:53:30,462
Okay, it's a shilling
for the three of you.

705
00:53:30,542 --> 00:53:33,582
Climb up the spout, and each of youse
have a look, but no wankin'.

706
00:53:33,622 --> 00:53:36,142
I've my own sisters. Why should I pay
to see your naked sisters?

707
00:53:36,222 --> 00:53:39,902
'Cause looking at your own naked sisters
is the worst sin ofall.

708
00:53:39,982 --> 00:53:43,182
Not even a bishop in the world could
forgive you for it.

709
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:45,142
What canyousee?

710
00:53:45,182 --> 00:53:47,782
- Oh, it's grand.
- Can you see their tits?

711
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:53,102
I said no wankin'.
There's to be no wankin' up the spout.

712
00:53:53,142 --> 00:53:55,662
- Oh, it's grand.
- I said no wankin' up the spout!

713
00:54:01,342 --> 00:54:04,462
- You perverted bunch of filth!
- Let go!

714
00:54:04,502 --> 00:54:07,982
My daughters can't even wash
themselves on a Friday night!

715
00:54:08,022 --> 00:54:11,142
Poor Quasimodo. He was right.

716
00:54:11,222 --> 00:54:14,822
Gawking at your own naked sisters
is the worst sin of all.

717
00:54:14,902 --> 00:54:17,182
Except when you charge
a shilling for the pleasure.

718
00:54:17,262 --> 00:54:19,222
That's worse still.

719
00:54:19,382 --> 00:54:23,102
Introibo adaltare Dei.
And then you say?

720
00:54:23,182 --> 00:54:26,382
Ad Deum quila etificat
juventutem meam.

721
00:54:26,422 --> 00:54:30,262
Right. Introibo adaltare Dei,
and then you say?

722
00:54:30,342 --> 00:54:33,582
Ad Deum quila etificat
juventutem meam.

723
00:54:33,622 --> 00:54:35,502
Very good. Again.
Introibo ad-

724
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:39,182
Ad Deum quila etificat
juventutem mean.

725
00:54:39,222 --> 00:54:43,542
Hello. How are you?
This is my son, Francis.

726
00:54:43,622 --> 00:54:47,822
He can recite the Latin,
and he's ready to be an altarboy.

727
00:54:47,862 --> 00:54:50,302
- Ad Deum-
- I'm sorry. We have no room.

728
00:55:00,902 --> 00:55:02,782
Never mind, son.

729
00:55:06,382 --> 00:55:09,582
Sacred Stan
said there was no room for him.

730
00:55:20,862 --> 00:55:24,022
I'll tell you
what it is.

731
00:55:24,102 --> 00:55:26,862
'Tis class distinction.

732
00:55:28,902 --> 00:55:31,862
They don't want the boys
from the lanes at the altar.

733
00:55:31,942 --> 00:55:34,102
They don't want the ones
with the scabby knees...

734
00:55:34,182 --> 00:55:36,822
and their arses hanging
out of their trousers.

735
00:55:38,822 --> 00:55:41,222
They want the boys with the nice shoes
and the clean hair...

736
00:55:41,262 --> 00:55:43,782
and the fathers
with the steady jobs.

737
00:55:43,862 --> 00:55:45,782
Not useless like you.

738
00:55:48,262 --> 00:55:51,662
That's what it is.

739
00:55:51,742 --> 00:55:54,822
And it's hard to hang on
to your faith.

740
00:56:15,262 --> 00:56:18,782
You buy pints for people you don't know
who tell you you're a grand man,

741
00:56:18,862 --> 00:56:22,062
while your children are at home with
their bellies stuck to their backbones.

742
00:56:24,662 --> 00:56:27,462
Aye, you're right.

743
00:56:27,502 --> 00:56:29,622
I'll get a job.
I promise.

744
00:56:29,702 --> 00:56:31,742
If you get a job,
you lose it the third week...

745
00:56:31,782 --> 00:56:33,662
because you drink
all the wages...

746
00:56:33,702 --> 00:56:36,862
and you miss the work.

747
00:56:36,902 --> 00:56:39,302
We'll get by, Angela.

748
00:56:39,342 --> 00:56:41,262
I'll change.

749
00:56:43,822 --> 00:56:46,342
The dole is 19 shillings
and the rent is 6.

750
00:56:46,422 --> 00:56:50,782
And that leaves 13 shillings
to feed and clothe 5 people.

751
00:56:53,142 --> 00:56:55,622
God is good, you know.

752
00:56:58,342 --> 00:57:00,382
God might be good
for someone somewhere,

753
00:57:00,462 --> 00:57:02,742
but he hasn't been seen lately
in the lanes of Limerick.

754
00:57:04,702 --> 00:57:06,542
Oh, Angela.

755
00:57:09,022 --> 00:57:11,422
You could go to hell
for saying that.

756
00:57:15,662 --> 00:57:17,942
Aren't I there already,
Malachy?

757
00:57:24,302 --> 00:57:26,462
Come here.
Come here.

758
00:57:42,102 --> 00:57:46,462
And then the angels
left another baby on the stairs again.

759
00:57:48,462 --> 00:57:50,342
What are you going
to call him, Angela?

760
00:57:50,422 --> 00:57:52,702
I like the name
Kevin or Sean.

761
00:57:52,742 --> 00:57:55,942
If you called out the door,
"Kevin, Sean, come in for your tea,"

762
00:57:55,982 --> 00:57:59,102
you'd have half of Limerick
running at you.

763
00:57:59,182 --> 00:58:02,302
- I like the name Alphonsus.
- Alphonsus?

764
00:58:02,342 --> 00:58:04,382
That's a stupid name.

765
00:58:04,422 --> 00:58:06,302
Ah, Jesus Christ!

766
00:58:06,342 --> 00:58:10,702
- Don't curse!
- Will you leave the poor child alone?

767
00:58:10,782 --> 00:58:13,422
I wondered how many more babies...

768
00:58:13,502 --> 00:58:15,342
the angels would leave
on the stairs.

769
00:58:15,422 --> 00:58:17,502
Someone else
to share my dinner with.

770
00:58:17,582 --> 00:58:19,462
Ow. What did you
do that for?

771
00:58:19,502 --> 00:58:21,702
Don't laugh.
Now you know what it feels like.

772
00:58:23,062 --> 00:58:25,542
At least my grandpa in the North...

773
00:58:25,622 --> 00:58:28,382
sent us five pounds
for the baby Alphie.

774
00:58:28,422 --> 00:58:32,222
All right. You go home and tell your
mother I'll be back in a few minutes.

775
00:58:32,262 --> 00:58:34,142
You're not to go
to the pub, Da.

776
00:58:34,182 --> 00:58:36,062
Mom said you're
to bring home the money.

777
00:58:36,102 --> 00:58:39,422
- You're not to drink the pint.
- Now listen.

778
00:58:39,502 --> 00:58:42,222
- You go home to your mother now.
- Da.

779
00:58:42,302 --> 00:58:44,742
Give us the money.
That money is for the new baby.

780
00:58:44,822 --> 00:58:46,702
Da!

781
00:58:46,782 --> 00:58:48,622
Please, Da.

782
00:58:52,622 --> 00:58:54,502
Go home!

783
00:59:05,782 --> 00:59:07,942
Will you come in here,
Frankie?

784
00:59:11,302 --> 00:59:13,182
I want you to go down
to South's Pub,

785
00:59:13,262 --> 00:59:15,702
and I want you to stand
in the middle of the pub...

786
00:59:15,782 --> 00:59:20,422
and tell every man that your father
is drinking the money for the baby.

787
00:59:20,502 --> 00:59:22,742
You're to tell the world there's not
a scrap of food in the house.

788
00:59:22,822 --> 00:59:25,182
There's not a lump of coal
for the fire.

789
00:59:25,262 --> 00:59:28,782
There's not even a drop of milk
for the baby's bottle.

790
00:59:33,982 --> 00:59:35,902
Oh, come on.

791
00:59:50,542 --> 00:59:56,102
And I pray that the world
would in peace let me be

792
00:59:56,182 --> 00:59:59,622
And the green glens
of Antrim

793
00:59:59,702 --> 01:00:03,342
Are welcoming me

794
01:00:03,382 --> 01:00:06,102
And if you only knew

795
01:00:06,182 --> 01:00:08,222
How the light of the moon

796
01:00:08,302 --> 01:00:11,902
My heart is banging
away, and all I can think of doing...

797
01:00:11,982 --> 01:00:14,822
is giving him a good kick
in the leg and running away.

798
01:00:14,902 --> 01:00:17,702
- You'd imagine a picture
- But I don't.

799
01:00:17,782 --> 01:00:20,942
Because I remember all the nice times
he sat me by the fire...

800
01:00:20,982 --> 01:00:25,222
and told me his stories of Cuchulain,
Roosevelt and De Valera.

801
01:00:28,542 --> 01:00:32,382
Later, he'll be home singing and
offering us a penny to die for Ireland.

802
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:34,942
It'll be different now.

803
01:00:35,022 --> 01:00:37,862
Because it's bad enough
to drink the dole or the wages,

804
01:00:37,942 --> 01:00:42,262
but a man who drinks the money for
a new baby has gone beyond the beyonds.

805
01:00:57,942 --> 01:00:59,782
Mam.

806
01:01:01,942 --> 01:01:04,502
I couldn't find him.

807
01:01:04,582 --> 01:01:07,102
Go to bed, Frankie.

808
01:01:17,502 --> 01:01:20,862
With Confirmation,

809
01:01:20,942 --> 01:01:23,582
you will become
true soldiers of the Church.

810
01:01:23,662 --> 01:01:28,222
That entitles you
to die a martyr...

811
01:01:28,302 --> 01:01:31,022
in the event we're invaded
by Protestants...

812
01:01:31,102 --> 01:01:35,262
or Mohammedans
or any other class of heathen.

813
01:01:35,342 --> 01:01:37,182
You will have the gifts...

814
01:01:37,262 --> 01:01:40,022
of the Holy Ghost.
wisdom...

815
01:01:40,102 --> 01:01:43,702
understanding,
counseI.

816
01:01:43,782 --> 01:01:45,982
What is the Third Station
of the Cross, my child?

817
01:01:46,062 --> 01:01:47,982
When Jesus falls
for the first time.

818
01:01:53,382 --> 01:01:55,222
What is the Fourth Commandment,
my child?

819
01:01:55,302 --> 01:01:58,062
Honor thy father
and thy mother.

820
01:02:01,262 --> 01:02:04,422
Are you allright, Frankie?

821
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:30,742
Father Gorey
is touching me with oiI and praying,

822
01:02:30,822 --> 01:02:32,942
and that means
I'm going to die.

823
01:02:34,742 --> 01:02:36,582
But I don't care.

824
01:02:42,742 --> 01:02:46,102
And then Dr. Campbell
came in and held my hand.

825
01:02:46,182 --> 01:02:48,942
It was then that I knew
I was going to get better.

826
01:02:52,182 --> 01:02:54,662
Because a doctor
would never fart...

827
01:02:54,742 --> 01:02:57,542
in the presence
of a dying boy.

828
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:08,742
They gave me a whole new body
full of blood.

829
01:03:08,822 --> 01:03:12,622
Sister Rita said it came from
a soldier at Sarsfield Barracks.

830
01:03:26,982 --> 01:03:30,062
Oh, son.

831
01:03:30,102 --> 01:03:32,462
You're a grand old soldier.

832
01:03:32,502 --> 01:03:35,382
What's wrong with me?

833
01:03:37,062 --> 01:03:39,262
You've had the typhoid.

834
01:03:44,182 --> 01:03:46,742
Don't go.

835
01:03:46,822 --> 01:03:51,022
Hey, you're
a big boy now.

836
01:03:51,102 --> 01:03:55,022
And don't forget you got
soldier's blood in you.

837
01:03:57,582 --> 01:03:59,422
You're over
the worst of it.

838
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:03,302
Soon be home
to Sorrento.

839
01:04:16,822 --> 01:04:19,982
That was the first
time my dad ever kissed me.

840
01:04:20,062 --> 01:04:24,102
I felt so happy I could have floated
out of the bed.

841
01:04:38,342 --> 01:04:41,742
Everyday, I couldn't wait
for the doctors and nurses...

842
01:04:41,782 --> 01:04:43,902
to leave me alone so that
Icould read my books.

843
01:04:43,982 --> 01:04:45,862
I loved having
a lavatory of my own...

844
01:04:45,942 --> 01:04:48,782
where I could read
for hours and hours.

845
01:04:48,822 --> 01:04:52,662
"To die, to sleep.
To sleep, perchance to dream.

846
01:04:52,742 --> 01:04:54,662
Aye, there's the rub. "

847
01:04:54,742 --> 01:04:56,622
Frankie, are you dead?

848
01:04:56,662 --> 01:04:58,982
Isn't it grand, Seamus?
It's Shakespeare.

849
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:00,982
I loved the Shakespeare.

850
01:05:01,062 --> 01:05:04,022
It was like having jewels in your mouth
when you said the words.

851
01:05:04,102 --> 01:05:07,182
"I do believe, induced
by potent circumstances,

852
01:05:07,222 --> 01:05:09,102
that thou art mine enemy. "

853
01:05:09,142 --> 01:05:12,382
"I do believe, induced
by potent circumstances,

854
01:05:12,462 --> 01:05:14,702
that thou art mine enemy. "

855
01:05:14,742 --> 01:05:18,182
"I do believe, induced
by potent circumstances,

856
01:05:18,262 --> 01:05:20,662
that thou art mine enemy. "

857
01:05:20,742 --> 01:05:22,982
- Bye! Bye!
- There's Frankie.

858
01:05:23,062 --> 01:05:25,902
But I missed me mom
and dad and Malachy...

859
01:05:25,942 --> 01:05:28,742
and little MichaeI
and the baby Alphie- God knows why.

860
01:05:28,822 --> 01:05:31,502
- Frankie, will you hurry up now?
- Bye.

861
01:05:31,542 --> 01:05:34,942
It was a happy day
when I finally went home.

862
01:05:38,542 --> 01:05:41,502
- Hello, Frankie.
- Welcome home, Frankie.

863
01:05:41,582 --> 01:05:43,422
You're a grand soldier,
Frankie.

864
01:05:43,502 --> 01:05:45,902
A credit to your
mother and father.

865
01:05:45,982 --> 01:05:47,862
Welcome home, Frankie.

866
01:05:49,422 --> 01:05:52,662
Hello, Frankie.

867
01:05:52,742 --> 01:05:56,822
It's grand
to have you home, soldier.

868
01:05:56,902 --> 01:05:59,102
Thank you, Mrs. Purcell.

869
01:05:59,182 --> 01:06:01,062
Goodman, Frankie.

870
01:06:06,342 --> 01:06:08,742
Ah, Francis, my boy.

871
01:06:08,822 --> 01:06:11,542
But the moment
I saw me dad with Alphie on his lap...

872
01:06:11,622 --> 01:06:13,542
was an empty feeling
in my heart,

873
01:06:13,622 --> 01:06:15,942
because I know
he's out of work again.

874
01:06:16,022 --> 01:06:18,382
- Welcome home, son.
- Da.

875
01:06:20,622 --> 01:06:22,462
It's good to see you.

876
01:06:22,542 --> 01:06:24,862
You too.

877
01:06:24,942 --> 01:06:26,942
Get a wee sit, right?

878
01:06:27,022 --> 01:06:30,142
St. Wilgefortis' mom
had nine children.

879
01:06:30,222 --> 01:06:34,022
But still, I loved
having my dad to myself in the morning.

880
01:06:34,062 --> 01:06:37,502
I loved his stories where motorcars
and planes went under water.

881
01:06:37,542 --> 01:06:40,062
Submarines
flew up in the air,

882
01:06:40,142 --> 01:06:42,862
and polar bears wrestled
with elephants on the moon.

883
01:06:42,942 --> 01:06:46,142
He was the Holy Trinity, wasmy dad,
with three people in him.

884
01:06:46,182 --> 01:06:50,342
The one in the morning with his tea
and Woodbines telling us the stories.

885
01:06:50,382 --> 01:06:54,182
The one who tried so hard
to find work but never did.

886
01:07:00,982 --> 01:07:05,302
And the one who came home at night
with the smell of whiskey on him.

887
01:07:23,622 --> 01:07:25,982
But he was reading all the time
he was at the hospital.

888
01:07:26,062 --> 01:07:29,502
I'm sorry, Mrs. McCourt.
He's missed over two months of school.

889
01:07:29,542 --> 01:07:33,822
He'll have to go back to the fifth
class. I'm really very sorry.

890
01:07:55,222 --> 01:07:59,062
Mom, I don't want to go back
to fifth class.

891
01:07:59,142 --> 01:08:01,862
Malachy's in fifth class,
and I'm a year older than him.

892
01:08:01,942 --> 01:08:03,822
Oh, come on, Frankie.

893
01:08:03,902 --> 01:08:06,742
But all me friends will laugh at me
because I've been put back.

894
01:08:06,822 --> 01:08:08,662
No.

895
01:08:15,302 --> 01:08:17,582
What I needed was a miracle,

896
01:08:17,662 --> 01:08:22,182
and it happened right there outside
the Our Lady Of Liberty Pub.

897
01:08:22,222 --> 01:08:24,782
I looked up at her.
She smiled.

898
01:08:24,862 --> 01:08:26,782
And when I looked down,
there was a penny.

899
01:08:42,662 --> 01:08:44,782
I spent the penny
on a candle...

900
01:08:44,862 --> 01:08:49,502
and prayed to St. Francis for him to
get me out of my little brother's class.

901
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:51,782
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name-

902
01:08:51,987 --> 01:08:56,187
Take that sour look off your puss,
Francis McCourt,

903
01:08:56,267 --> 01:08:58,308
or you will feel
the end of my stick.

904
01:08:58,348 --> 01:09:00,548
Francis McCourt
is going to show you...

905
01:09:00,588 --> 01:09:04,748
how well he learned
to write in this class last year.

906
01:09:04,828 --> 01:09:07,909
He's going to write a composition
on our Lord.

907
01:09:07,949 --> 01:09:10,349
Aren't you, McCourt?

908
01:09:10,389 --> 01:09:15,030
He's to tell us what it would be like
if our Lord had grown up in Limerick,

909
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:16,990
the holiest city in Ireland.

910
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:21,030
Wilgefortis' dad wanted to marry her
off to the King of Sicily,

911
01:09:21,070 --> 01:09:23,271
but the beautiful,
young Wilgefortis...

912
01:09:23,311 --> 01:09:26,111
was desperate not to marry
the scabby old man.

913
01:09:26,191 --> 01:09:28,031
Oh.

914
01:09:28,111 --> 01:09:30,311
And McCourt scores
a brilliant goal.

915
01:09:35,592 --> 01:09:39,712
They said that Limerick
was the holiest city,

916
01:09:39,792 --> 01:09:42,833
but everyone knewthe reason why there
were always people in the churches.

917
01:09:42,913 --> 01:09:45,113
It was because
it was always raining,

918
01:09:45,193 --> 01:09:47,113
and they were in there
to get out of the wet.

919
01:09:47,153 --> 01:09:49,114
The name of my composition is-

920
01:09:49,194 --> 01:09:52,914
Title, McCourt.
The title.

921
01:09:52,954 --> 01:09:56,114
The title of my composition
is "Jesus and the Weather. "

922
01:09:56,194 --> 01:09:58,475
What?

923
01:09:58,515 --> 01:10:00,915
"Jesus and the Weather," sir.

924
01:10:00,955 --> 01:10:03,315
All right, read it.

925
01:10:03,355 --> 01:10:05,435
"I don't think Jesus,
who is our Lord,

926
01:10:05,515 --> 01:10:07,596
would have liked
the weather in Limerick,

927
01:10:07,676 --> 01:10:11,796
because it's always raining and
the Shannon keeps the whole city damp.

928
01:10:11,836 --> 01:10:14,637
My father says the Shannon
is a killer river...

929
01:10:14,677 --> 01:10:16,557
because it killed
my two brothers.

930
01:10:16,597 --> 01:10:18,477
When you look at pictures
of Jesus,

931
01:10:18,517 --> 01:10:22,437
He's always wandering around
ancient IsraeI in a sheet.

932
01:10:22,517 --> 01:10:25,718
It never rains there, and you never hear
of anyone coughing...

933
01:10:25,758 --> 01:10:28,478
or getting the consumption
or anything like that.

934
01:10:28,558 --> 01:10:32,079
And no one has a job there,
because all they do is stand around,

935
01:10:32,119 --> 01:10:36,839
eat manna, shake their fists,
and go to crucifixions.

936
01:10:36,919 --> 01:10:40,479
Any time Jesus got hungry, all He had
to do was to walk up the road...

937
01:10:40,559 --> 01:10:43,640
to a fig tree oran orange tree
and have His fill.

938
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:46,560
Or if He wanted a pint, He could
wave Hish and over a big glass...

939
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,480
and there was the pint.

940
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,921
Or He could visit Mary Magdalene
and her sister Martha,

941
01:10:51,961 --> 01:10:54,601
and they'd give Him His dinner,
no questions asked.

942
01:10:54,681 --> 01:10:58,802
So it's a good thing Jesus decided to
be born Jewish in that nice warm place.

943
01:10:58,842 --> 01:11:01,562
Because if He was born in Limerick,
He'd catch the consumption...

944
01:11:01,602 --> 01:11:04,882
and be dead in a month, and there
wouldn't be any Catholic Church,

945
01:11:04,922 --> 01:11:07,083
and we wouldn't have to write
compositions about Him.

946
01:11:07,163 --> 01:11:09,003
The end. "

947
01:11:11,363 --> 01:11:13,563
Did you write this composition,
McCourt?

948
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:16,324
I did, sir.

949
01:11:18,084 --> 01:11:19,964
The miracle worked.

950
01:11:20,004 --> 01:11:22,364
I was back
in my old class.

951
01:11:22,404 --> 01:11:24,285
Stock your mind.

952
01:11:24,325 --> 01:11:26,205
It's your house
of treasure,

953
01:11:26,245 --> 01:11:29,405
and no one in the world
can interfere with it.

954
01:11:29,445 --> 01:11:34,166
Fill your mind with rubbish,
and it'll rot your head.

955
01:11:34,206 --> 01:11:37,846
You might be poor,
your shoes might be broken,

956
01:11:37,886 --> 01:11:39,766
but your mind-

957
01:11:39,806 --> 01:11:44,087
your mind is a palace.

958
01:11:44,247 --> 01:11:47,607
And McCourt gets the ball,
he goes round one man...

959
01:11:47,687 --> 01:11:49,487
he goes up to the second man-

960
01:11:49,567 --> 01:11:51,608
Peggy! Sean!

961
01:11:51,688 --> 01:11:54,448
Kathleen,
come in for your tea.

962
01:11:54,528 --> 01:11:56,368
Come in for
the lovely leg of lamb...

963
01:11:56,448 --> 01:12:00,449
and the gorgeous green peas,
and the floury white potatoes.

964
01:12:00,489 --> 01:12:03,129
Oh, shut up,
will you, woman?

965
01:12:03,169 --> 01:12:05,289
It's a low-class mind
to torment your neighbors...

966
01:12:05,369 --> 01:12:07,209
when there's nothing
but bread and tea we have.

967
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:09,450
Get off to work in England
like the rest of our husbands.

968
01:12:09,530 --> 01:12:11,370
Go and help England
win a war?

969
01:12:11,450 --> 01:12:13,330
I wouldn't give the English
the steam off my pish.

970
01:12:13,410 --> 01:12:15,410
No, you'd rather
drink the dole...

971
01:12:15,490 --> 01:12:17,731
and watch your sons
run around all skin and bone...

972
01:12:17,811 --> 01:12:19,971
with their arse hanging out
of their trousers.

973
01:12:20,051 --> 01:12:22,291
Kathleen,
come in for your tea.

974
01:12:22,371 --> 01:12:24,371
If I could work,
I'd be in the English factories.

975
01:12:24,451 --> 01:12:26,892
A factory's no place
for a woman.

976
01:12:26,972 --> 01:12:29,852
Sitting on your arse
is no place for a man.

977
01:12:31,012 --> 01:12:34,053
And the game restarts
in the second half.

978
01:12:34,093 --> 01:12:36,213
He's got the ball.
He's going on the run.

979
01:12:36,293 --> 01:12:38,133
Oh, you got
the ball off him.

980
01:12:47,534 --> 01:12:50,214
Get off me, will you?

981
01:12:50,254 --> 01:12:54,495
I'm worn out.

982
01:12:54,535 --> 01:12:57,215
That's the end of it for me.
No more children.

983
01:12:59,295 --> 01:13:01,736
A good Catholic woman should perform
her wifely duties.

984
01:13:01,816 --> 01:13:03,656
Oh, feck off, will you?

985
01:13:08,256 --> 01:13:11,577
You'll face
eternal damnation, Angela.

986
01:13:11,657 --> 01:13:13,497
Well, as long as there
are no more children,

987
01:13:13,577 --> 01:13:16,857
eternal damnation sounds just fine
to me, Malachy.

988
01:13:39,740 --> 01:13:42,060
Come on, lads, come on.
You'll miss the train.

989
01:13:42,140 --> 01:13:43,981
You'll miss a good job.
Come on.

990
01:13:44,061 --> 01:13:46,781
We've got the Guinness, and we've
got the Jameson in England, all right?

991
01:14:01,583 --> 01:14:04,223
Right. Uh-

992
01:14:04,303 --> 01:14:06,183
Remember your religious duties.

993
01:14:08,303 --> 01:14:11,344
And above all, you obey
your mother, right?

994
01:14:13,224 --> 01:14:16,824
You're the man
of the house now, Francis.

995
01:14:18,865 --> 01:14:21,065
Mind yourself.

996
01:14:32,146 --> 01:14:34,266
Come on. Let's go.

997
01:14:48,788 --> 01:14:51,908
Mam said all
we had to do was wait two weeks...

998
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:53,829
for the telegram
with the money order.

999
01:14:53,909 --> 01:14:56,629
Soon we'd have enough money
for new boots and coats,

1000
01:14:56,709 --> 01:14:58,829
ham, cabbage
and potatoes for dinner,

1001
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:02,190
electric light and maybe even a lavatory
like they have in America.

1002
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:04,110
Now that Dad
is gone to England,

1003
01:15:04,150 --> 01:15:06,510
sure I your troubles
would be over.

1004
01:15:06,590 --> 01:15:08,430
Surely.

1005
01:15:20,952 --> 01:15:23,912
- Hello. Thank you very much.
- Hi.

1006
01:15:23,992 --> 01:15:26,672
- Thank you.
- There he is!

1007
01:15:28,793 --> 01:15:31,993
Hey, wait!
Has ours come?McCourt?

1008
01:15:32,073 --> 01:15:34,673
- No.
- Are you sure? It's our first telegram.

1009
01:15:34,753 --> 01:15:37,954
It should be for about three pounds
or maybe more.

1010
01:15:38,034 --> 01:15:40,234
- Sorry.
- Can you look in your pouch again?

1011
01:15:40,314 --> 01:15:43,034
I feckin' did already.
I've nothing for you.

1012
01:16:16,558 --> 01:16:19,919
- Who's a good boy?
- Alphie!

1013
01:16:21,919 --> 01:16:25,799
Begging for leftovers
is worse than the dole.

1014
01:16:25,879 --> 01:16:30,000
Worse than the St. Vincent
de PauI Charity. My own mother begging.

1015
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:32,880
This is the worst kind
of shame-

1016
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:35,160
begging for the leftovers
from the priests' dinner.

1017
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:38,961
Like tinkers holding up
their scabby children on street corners.

1018
01:16:39,041 --> 01:16:42,521
Worse than borrowing
from the money lender, Mrs. Finucane.

1019
01:17:00,243 --> 01:17:02,163
There was
only one thing for it.

1020
01:17:02,243 --> 01:17:04,884
I had to get a job.

1021
01:17:10,204 --> 01:17:12,805
This is the best morning
of all, Frankie,

1022
01:17:12,885 --> 01:17:15,165
Saturday half day.

1023
01:17:15,205 --> 01:17:19,005
We start at 8:00 and finish
by the time the Angelus rings at 12:00.

1024
01:17:37,887 --> 01:17:40,488
The dipsy doodle
is the thing to beware

1025
01:17:40,568 --> 01:17:43,408
The dipsy doodle
is gonna get in your hair

1026
01:17:43,488 --> 01:17:45,528
And if it gets you
it couldn't be worse

1027
01:17:45,608 --> 01:17:48,409
The things you say will
all come out in reverse

1028
01:17:48,489 --> 01:17:50,889
Don't go up the mine,
Manny

1029
01:17:50,969 --> 01:17:54,129
That's the way
the dipsy doodle works

1030
01:17:54,209 --> 01:17:56,290
The dipsy doodle
isso easy to find

1031
01:17:56,330 --> 01:17:59,370
It's almost always
at the back of your mind

1032
01:17:59,450 --> 01:18:02,330
You never know it's there
untiI it's too late

1033
01:18:02,410 --> 01:18:04,531
And then you get
in such a terrible state

1034
01:18:04,611 --> 01:18:07,091
The moon jumped
over the cow, hey diddle

1035
01:18:07,171 --> 01:18:09,331
That's the way
the dipsy doodle works

1036
01:18:31,294 --> 01:18:35,534
The man who delivered 16 hundred weight
of coal deserves a pint.

1037
01:18:35,614 --> 01:18:37,814
And the boy who helped him
deserves a lemonade.

1038
01:18:39,335 --> 01:18:42,735
Your eyes look atrocious-
like two piss-holes in the snow.

1039
01:18:42,815 --> 01:18:47,455
- It's the coal dust, Uncle Pa.
- You're a great man, Frank.

1040
01:18:47,535 --> 01:18:50,016
You can help me
every Thursday after school.

1041
01:18:50,096 --> 01:18:52,096
There's a shilling foryou.

1042
01:18:52,176 --> 01:18:54,216
More power to your elbow,
Frankie.

1043
01:18:54,256 --> 01:18:57,177
He'll be taking yourjob yet,
you know,John.

1044
01:19:01,297 --> 01:19:04,377
He called me Frank, not Frankie.

1045
01:19:04,457 --> 01:19:06,818
For the first time,
I feeI like a man.

1046
01:19:06,898 --> 01:19:08,778
A man with a shilling
in his pocket.

1047
01:19:08,818 --> 01:19:10,978
A man who had a drink
in a pub.

1048
01:19:18,179 --> 01:19:22,580
Ma, I earned a shilling.

1049
01:19:22,660 --> 01:19:25,980
Take tuppence, Frankie,
and take Malachy to the Lyric.

1050
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:29,260
You're a treasure, Frankie.
You deserve it.

1051
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:32,181
God above,
look at those eyes.

1052
01:19:52,823 --> 01:19:54,383
Frankie!

1053
01:19:56,983 --> 01:19:58,864
Frankie!

1054
01:20:01,424 --> 01:20:04,464
A shilling from Mr. Hannon,
and four shillings in tips.

1055
01:20:06,505 --> 01:20:09,305
Will you go to that mirror
and look at your eyes?

1056
01:20:15,026 --> 01:20:17,266
Oh, jeez.

1057
01:20:17,306 --> 01:20:19,306
That's the end of it.
No more Mr. Hannon.

1058
01:20:19,386 --> 01:20:21,226
Mr. Hannon needs me.

1059
01:20:21,306 --> 01:20:23,587
I'm sorry
for Mr. Hannon's troubles,

1060
01:20:23,667 --> 01:20:26,107
but we have troubles
of our own.

1061
01:20:26,187 --> 01:20:29,027
And the last thing I need
is a blind son.

1062
01:20:29,107 --> 01:20:31,667
Now, wash your eyes,
and you can go to the Lyric.

1063
01:20:38,188 --> 01:20:40,909
Malachy, what's happening?

1064
01:20:40,989 --> 01:20:44,589
The man in the hat is sticking a gold
dagger into the nice lady's belly.

1065
01:20:44,669 --> 01:20:47,549
- Is there blood all over?
- No. She's showing a magic ring.

1066
01:20:47,629 --> 01:20:49,750
I can't see a thing.

1067
01:20:56,350 --> 01:20:58,551
The doctor said...

1068
01:20:58,631 --> 01:21:00,471
this was the worst case of
conjunctivit is he'd ever seen.

1069
01:21:00,511 --> 01:21:02,711
How long will he be in, Doctor?

1070
01:21:02,751 --> 01:21:04,631
Only God knows that,
woman.

1071
01:21:04,671 --> 01:21:06,551
I should have seen
this child months ago.

1072
01:21:06,591 --> 01:21:08,352
My working days were over.

1073
01:21:08,432 --> 01:21:12,912
Eyes wide open.
Wider. Wide as you can.

1074
01:21:12,992 --> 01:21:16,633
- Ow, Ma!
- If only dad was here.

1075
01:22:12,799 --> 01:22:16,119
He's not coming, Mam.

1076
01:22:16,159 --> 01:22:18,040
He might be asleep
in one of the carriages.

1077
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:21,080
Come on, Mam. Let's go home.
He's not coming.

1078
01:22:26,641 --> 01:22:30,281
He definitely said in his letter
two days before Christmas.

1079
01:22:30,361 --> 01:22:32,201
Maybe the boat
from Holyhead was late.

1080
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:34,122
That could make you
miss your train.

1081
01:22:34,202 --> 01:22:36,042
The Irish Sea's desperate
this time of year.

1082
01:22:36,122 --> 01:22:38,922
He doesn't care about us.
He's over there drunk in England.

1083
01:22:39,002 --> 01:22:40,842
Don't talk about
your father like that.

1084
01:22:43,443 --> 01:22:46,403
- Boots!
- Me! Me!

1085
01:22:46,483 --> 01:22:48,643
Next.

1086
01:22:48,723 --> 01:22:50,803
And where's the husband?

1087
01:22:50,883 --> 01:22:52,764
He's in England, sir.

1088
01:22:52,804 --> 01:22:54,684
England, is it?

1089
01:22:54,724 --> 01:22:57,524
And where's the weekly telegram?
The big five pounds?

1090
01:22:57,564 --> 01:22:59,764
He didn't send us a penny
in months, sir.

1091
01:22:59,844 --> 01:23:03,005
Well, we all probably
know why, don't we?

1092
01:23:05,885 --> 01:23:07,285
No, sir.

1093
01:23:07,325 --> 01:23:10,526
We all know there's more than
an occasional Limerick man...

1094
01:23:10,606 --> 01:23:15,326
been seen trotting around with
a Piccadilly tart, don't we?

1095
01:23:15,366 --> 01:23:18,127
He's not in Piccadilly, sir.
He's in Coventry.

1096
01:23:18,207 --> 01:23:22,927
Mam went begging
again at the St. Vincent de PauI.

1097
01:23:23,007 --> 01:23:26,768
She got a food voucher so that at least
we could have a Christmas dinner.

1098
01:23:36,009 --> 01:23:38,249
And then, on Christmas Eve,

1099
01:23:38,329 --> 01:23:40,529
our neighbor,
Walter the horse, died.

1100
01:23:40,609 --> 01:23:43,610
And our dad came home.

1101
01:23:43,650 --> 01:23:45,530
It's Pa!

1102
01:23:45,570 --> 01:23:47,450
Dad!Dad!

1103
01:24:07,972 --> 01:24:09,853
Hey.

1104
01:24:09,893 --> 01:24:13,733
- We were expecting you yesterday.
- Aye, well.

1105
01:24:17,213 --> 01:24:19,294
Jesus and Mary,
what have you done to yourself?

1106
01:24:19,374 --> 01:24:21,294
Well, that Irish Sea
was very rough, you know.

1107
01:24:21,374 --> 01:24:25,974
Bumped my head.
Nearly fell over the side.

1108
01:24:26,054 --> 01:24:27,975
Wouldn't be a fight, would it?
Wouldn't be the drink?

1109
01:24:30,015 --> 01:24:32,455
You said you'd
bring us something.

1110
01:24:37,776 --> 01:24:40,416
Well, uh,

1111
01:24:40,456 --> 01:24:42,336
I have.

1112
01:24:48,297 --> 01:24:50,537
Got a bit peckish
on the boat, did you?

1113
01:24:53,538 --> 01:24:56,578
We'll have them tomorrow
after our Christmas dinner.

1114
01:24:57,578 --> 01:24:59,458
Did you bring any money?

1115
01:25:01,739 --> 01:25:04,699
You drank the money,
didn't you?

1116
01:25:06,499 --> 01:25:11,140
Well, times are hard, Angela.
Jobs are scarce.

1117
01:25:11,180 --> 01:25:15,460
- You drank the money, Da?
- You drank the money.

1118
01:25:20,181 --> 01:25:23,941
So they have no respect
for their father now, eh?

1119
01:25:27,701 --> 01:25:29,822
- I have to go and see a man.
- Go and see a man,

1120
01:25:29,902 --> 01:25:32,382
but don't be coming home drunk,
singing your stupid songs.

1121
01:25:59,465 --> 01:26:01,425
Eat something.
It's Christmas.

1122
01:26:03,266 --> 01:26:05,786
I'm not hungry.

1123
01:26:05,866 --> 01:26:08,026
But if no one wants them,
I'll have one of them sheep's eyes.

1124
01:26:08,106 --> 01:26:10,786
- Oh, not the eyes, Dad.
- Da, don't.

1125
01:26:10,866 --> 01:26:13,547
- Oh, Dad, don't.
- What's the matter with you?

1126
01:26:13,587 --> 01:26:16,587
You're notgoing to eat that,
are you? Oh!

1127
01:26:16,667 --> 01:26:19,307
Dad, oh, yuck.

1128
01:26:19,347 --> 01:26:21,668
- You're disgusting.
- Lovely.

1129
01:26:21,748 --> 01:26:25,068
There's great nourishment
in the eyes.

1130
01:26:32,269 --> 01:26:34,109
Right.

1131
01:26:37,269 --> 01:26:39,110
Where are you going?

1132
01:26:39,190 --> 01:26:41,030
Going to London.

1133
01:26:42,910 --> 01:26:44,870
On Christmas Day?

1134
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:46,831
It's the best day
to traveI.

1135
01:26:46,871 --> 01:26:48,671
People in motorcars
are always willing to give...

1136
01:26:48,751 --> 01:26:51,311
the working man
a lift to Dublin.

1137
01:26:51,391 --> 01:26:53,871
Think of all the hard times
of the Holy Family and feel guilty.

1138
01:26:53,951 --> 01:26:56,072
How will you get
to Holyhead?

1139
01:26:56,152 --> 01:26:59,712
Same way I came.

1140
01:26:59,792 --> 01:27:02,552
There's always a time
when no one's looking.

1141
01:27:10,393 --> 01:27:12,234
Right.

1142
01:27:16,474 --> 01:27:19,754
You be good boys, eh?
Say your prayers.

1143
01:27:19,834 --> 01:27:21,675
Obey your mother.

1144
01:27:26,995 --> 01:27:29,876
I'll write.

1145
01:27:33,916 --> 01:27:35,756
Here, pass them down.

1146
01:27:38,677 --> 01:27:40,997
Mmm. I got a nut.

1147
01:27:41,077 --> 01:27:44,597
I didn't get a nut.
How come Frankie always gets a nut?

1148
01:27:44,637 --> 01:27:47,038
Nuts are good
for sore eyes.

1149
01:27:47,118 --> 01:27:49,238
I've a Turkish Delight.

1150
01:27:49,318 --> 01:27:51,238
Will the nut make his eyes better?

1151
01:27:51,318 --> 01:27:53,158
'Twill.

1152
01:27:53,238 --> 01:27:55,078
One eye or two eyes?

1153
01:27:55,158 --> 01:27:57,839
Two eyes, I think.

1154
01:27:57,919 --> 01:28:01,679
Frankie, if I had a nut,
I'd give it to you. I would, really.

1155
01:28:01,759 --> 01:28:04,800
Mam, can me and Michael
have another chocolate? Just the one.

1156
01:28:45,684 --> 01:28:49,445
If I were in America,
I could say, "I love you, Dad, "

1157
01:28:49,485 --> 01:28:51,765
the way they do
in the films.

1158
01:28:51,845 --> 01:28:53,885
But in Limerick,
they'd laugh at you.

1159
01:28:53,965 --> 01:28:55,845
In Limerick, you're
only allowed to say...

1160
01:28:55,885 --> 01:28:58,846
you love God and babies
and horses that win.

1161
01:28:58,926 --> 01:29:01,766
Anything else
is softness in the head.

1162
01:29:01,806 --> 01:29:04,366
Go home, Frankie.

1163
01:29:20,488 --> 01:29:23,329
In another week,
a telegram arrived for three pounds,

1164
01:29:23,369 --> 01:29:26,809
and we were in heaven.

1165
01:29:31,730 --> 01:29:35,170
The next Saturday,
there was no telegram.

1166
01:29:35,250 --> 01:29:37,490
Nor the week after.

1167
01:29:37,530 --> 01:29:40,531
Nor any Saturday forever.

1168
01:30:09,454 --> 01:30:11,294
What are you doing?

1169
01:30:11,374 --> 01:30:14,174
Careful. We're making a fire.
It's freezing.

1170
01:30:14,254 --> 01:30:16,735
Come on, Frankie,
give us a hand, will you?

1171
01:30:16,815 --> 01:30:19,135
Oh! Yay!

1172
01:30:19,175 --> 01:30:22,055
Take the Pope, MichaeI.

1173
01:30:22,135 --> 01:30:24,016
Here, put the Pope
on the bed.

1174
01:30:49,979 --> 01:30:53,499
- Is that you, Frankie?
- 'Tis, Mrs. Purcell.

1175
01:30:53,539 --> 01:30:55,499
Come on in
out of the cold, son.

1176
01:30:58,179 --> 01:31:00,940
Holy blessed God,
you're freezing with the cold, boy.

1177
01:31:10,381 --> 01:31:13,661
Isn't it grand,
the radio, Frankie?

1178
01:31:13,701 --> 01:31:16,302
'Tis, Mrs. Purcell.

1179
01:31:16,382 --> 01:31:19,422
Do you see Bedouins
in the Sahara...

1180
01:31:19,502 --> 01:31:22,662
and the cowboys
on the prairie?

1181
01:31:22,702 --> 01:31:24,583
I do.

1182
01:31:24,623 --> 01:31:26,703
And people sipping wine
in cafes.

1183
01:31:26,783 --> 01:31:30,303
And sailors in their galleons
sipping their cocoa.

1184
01:31:30,383 --> 01:31:34,424
And plays about the Greeks, where they
have to pluck out their eyes...

1185
01:31:34,504 --> 01:31:36,984
because they married
their mothers by mistake.

1186
01:31:37,064 --> 01:31:40,424
And the Shakespeare.
I love the Shakespeare.

1187
01:31:40,504 --> 01:31:43,145
Shakespeare is like mashed potatoes,
Mrs. Purcell.

1188
01:31:43,225 --> 01:31:45,185
You can'tget enough
of them.

1189
01:31:45,225 --> 01:31:49,825
I'm sure Mr. Shakespeare
must have been an Irishman.

1190
01:31:49,865 --> 01:31:53,906
If you want
the things you love

1191
01:31:53,986 --> 01:31:57,026
You must have showers

1192
01:31:57,066 --> 01:32:00,427
Ah, Billie Holiday.

1193
01:32:02,147 --> 01:32:04,787
Oh, Billie, Billie.

1194
01:32:04,867 --> 01:32:06,827
I want to be with you
in America.

1195
01:32:06,907 --> 01:32:08,748
There'll be pennies
from heaven

1196
01:32:08,828 --> 01:32:11,308
For you andme

1197
01:32:11,388 --> 01:32:14,028
Oh, America.

1198
01:32:14,108 --> 01:32:16,508
Where no one has bad teeth
and everyone has a lavatory.

1199
01:32:25,910 --> 01:32:28,710
Great God in heaven,
where's the other room?

1200
01:32:28,750 --> 01:32:30,630
What room?

1201
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:32,750
I rented you two rooms
up here, and one is gone.

1202
01:32:32,830 --> 01:32:35,951
I distinctly remember a wall
because I distinctly remember a room.

1203
01:32:36,031 --> 01:32:38,631
- Where's that room gone?
- I don't remember a wall.

1204
01:32:38,711 --> 01:32:41,911
And if I don't remember a wall,
I can't remember a room.

1205
01:32:41,991 --> 01:32:44,912
I want to know where that wall is
and what she did with that room!

1206
01:32:44,992 --> 01:32:47,792
Do any of you
remember a wall?

1207
01:32:47,832 --> 01:32:50,312
Is that the wall
we burned in the fire?

1208
01:32:50,392 --> 01:32:52,953
Dear God.
This takes the bloody biscuit.

1209
01:32:53,033 --> 01:32:57,073
It's four weeks behind
in the rent you are, and now this.

1210
01:32:57,153 --> 01:32:59,193
Out, missus.
I'm putting you out.

1211
01:32:59,273 --> 01:33:01,114
One week from today,
I'll knock on this door,

1212
01:33:01,194 --> 01:33:03,194
and I want to find
nobody home.

1213
01:33:03,274 --> 01:33:06,514
Everybody out.
Never to return.

1214
01:33:06,594 --> 01:33:09,115
'Tis a pity you weren't alive
when the English...

1215
01:33:09,195 --> 01:33:11,595
were evicting us
and leaving us on the road.

1216
01:33:11,635 --> 01:33:14,955
No lip from you, missus, or I'll send
the men to put you out tomorrow.

1217
01:33:14,995 --> 01:33:19,036
It's out on the pavement you'll be
with the sky peeing on your furniture.

1218
01:33:24,396 --> 01:33:27,197
Oh, dear God in heaven,
what am I going to do?

1219
01:33:27,277 --> 01:33:30,037
Your cousin, Laman Griffin,
is living on the Rosbrien Road...

1220
01:33:30,117 --> 01:33:31,957
in that little house
of his mother's.

1221
01:33:32,037 --> 01:33:34,357
He'll surely take you in
till better times come.

1222
01:33:34,397 --> 01:33:36,318
I'll go and see him now.

1223
01:33:36,398 --> 01:33:39,158
Frankie, come with me.
And put your mac on.

1224
01:33:39,238 --> 01:33:41,278
I haven't got a mac.

1225
01:33:41,358 --> 01:33:43,639
Jesus, what a family.

1226
01:33:50,239 --> 01:33:52,400
Grandma caught a chill that day,

1227
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:55,280
and the chill
turned to pneumonia.

1228
01:33:55,320 --> 01:33:57,400
They shifted her
to the City Home HospitaI,

1229
01:33:57,480 --> 01:34:00,320
and when she died,
Mam said that herfamily...

1230
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:03,561
was disappearing
before her very eyes.

1231
01:34:13,682 --> 01:34:16,362
- Frankie, will you shut the door?
- Let's go.

1232
01:34:16,442 --> 01:34:18,803
- Right. Let's go.
- Malachy, the wheel's all bockety.

1233
01:34:18,843 --> 01:34:21,243
- Kaiser Bill marched over the hill
- Shut up, will you?

1234
01:34:21,283 --> 01:34:23,963
To fight
the British Army

1235
01:34:24,043 --> 01:34:28,164
They're all going to know
we got the eviction. Will you be quiet?

1236
01:34:34,364 --> 01:34:37,605
And so Malachy, MichaeI, Mam, and me...

1237
01:34:37,685 --> 01:34:42,365
moved into mom's cousin's-
Laman Griffin- on the Rosbrien Road.

1238
01:34:45,766 --> 01:34:48,806
- Did you get the library books?
- I did.

1239
01:34:48,886 --> 01:34:52,326
Go in the yard and see if there's
something else to go on this fire.

1240
01:34:52,406 --> 01:34:55,687
- Is that for us?
- No, his lordship upstairs.

1241
01:34:55,767 --> 01:34:58,807
Why ask?
It was the same every week-

1242
01:34:58,847 --> 01:35:01,407
one steak, four potatoes, an onion,
anda bottle of stout.

1243
01:35:01,487 --> 01:35:03,808
Frankie, are you back?

1244
01:35:03,848 --> 01:35:05,728
Will you
take up the books?

1245
01:35:14,449 --> 01:35:16,569
Good boy, Frankie.
Put them on the bed there.

1246
01:35:16,609 --> 01:35:18,529
Angela, the chamber pot
is full.

1247
01:35:18,569 --> 01:35:21,250
Is there anything else
your lordship would like?

1248
01:35:21,330 --> 01:35:23,610
Woman's work, Angela.
Woman's work and free rent.

1249
01:35:23,650 --> 01:35:25,890
- I'll empty it.
- You will?

1250
01:35:25,930 --> 01:35:29,611
Okay, Frankie. Take it outside
and rinse it under the tap.

1251
01:35:29,691 --> 01:35:31,811
And from now on,
that will be your job.

1252
01:36:04,735 --> 01:36:08,735
America,
wonderfull and of the Arapaho,

1253
01:36:08,775 --> 01:36:11,175
Cheyenne, Chippewa,

1254
01:36:11,255 --> 01:36:15,096
Sioux, Apache, Iroquois.

1255
01:36:15,176 --> 01:36:18,656
Poetry, boys.
And the chiefs! Listen.

1256
01:36:18,696 --> 01:36:21,217
Kicking Bear,
Rain-in-the-Face,

1257
01:36:21,297 --> 01:36:23,297
Sitting Bull,
Crazy Horse,

1258
01:36:23,377 --> 01:36:25,417
and the man himself,

1259
01:36:25,497 --> 01:36:28,377
the genius Geronimo.

1260
01:36:31,058 --> 01:36:34,858
Stock your minds, boys,
and you can move through the world...

1261
01:36:34,898 --> 01:36:37,058
resplendent.

1262
01:36:37,098 --> 01:36:40,099
Clarke, define "resplendent. "

1263
01:36:40,179 --> 01:36:43,859
- I think it's shining, sir.
- Pithy but adequate.

1264
01:36:43,939 --> 01:36:46,460
McCourt, give us a sentence
with "pithy. "

1265
01:36:48,860 --> 01:36:51,500
Clarke is pithy
but adequate, sir.

1266
01:36:51,580 --> 01:36:53,700
Adroit, McCourt.

1267
01:36:53,780 --> 01:36:57,221
You have a mind for the priesthood,
my boy, or politics.

1268
01:36:58,981 --> 01:37:01,381
Tell you mother
to come and see me.

1269
01:37:01,421 --> 01:37:03,341
Hoppy O'Halloran told Mam...

1270
01:37:03,381 --> 01:37:05,262
to take me
to the Christian Brothers-

1271
01:37:05,342 --> 01:37:08,462
to say he sent me,
and I was a bright boy...

1272
01:37:08,542 --> 01:37:10,382
and ought to be going
to secondary schooI...

1273
01:37:10,462 --> 01:37:12,423
and maybe
to university even.

1274
01:37:12,463 --> 01:37:14,463
I wish he'd mind
his own business.

1275
01:37:14,543 --> 01:37:16,503
I want to quit schooI forever and get
a job with wages every Friday night...

1276
01:37:16,538 --> 01:37:18,463
I want to quit schooI forever and get
a job with wages every Fridaynight...

1277
01:37:18,543 --> 01:37:22,104
and go to the pictures
every Saturday like everybody else.

1278
01:37:22,184 --> 01:37:24,064
I've come to see
Brother Murray.

1279
01:37:24,144 --> 01:37:26,104
I don't know why we bothered.
They took one look at us...

1280
01:37:26,184 --> 01:37:30,505
- What do you want?
- This is my son Frank.

1281
01:37:30,585 --> 01:37:33,145
and said no.

1282
01:37:35,825 --> 01:37:37,945
Francis, will you
listen to me?

1283
01:37:37,985 --> 01:37:39,906
Are you listening?

1284
01:37:39,986 --> 01:37:41,826
I am.

1285
01:37:41,906 --> 01:37:44,706
You're never to let anybody slam
the door in your face again.

1286
01:37:44,786 --> 01:37:46,746
Do you hear me?

1287
01:37:46,826 --> 01:37:48,707
I do.

1288
01:37:50,067 --> 01:37:54,747
Impurity.
I say again, impurity.

1289
01:37:54,827 --> 01:37:58,388
Impurity
is so grave a sin...

1290
01:37:59,748 --> 01:38:02,788
the Virgin Maryturns
her face away and weeps.

1291
01:38:02,868 --> 01:38:05,829
She weeps when
she looks down...

1292
01:38:05,909 --> 01:38:07,789
that long, dreary vista
of time...

1293
01:38:07,869 --> 01:38:11,869
and beholds in horror
the spectacle of Limerick boys...

1294
01:38:11,949 --> 01:38:15,870
defiling themselves,
polluting themselves,

1295
01:38:15,950 --> 01:38:20,230
soiling their young bodies
which are the temple of the Holy Ghost.

1296
01:38:20,310 --> 01:38:23,071
Interfering with themselves.

1297
01:38:23,151 --> 01:38:26,471
We pray to the Virgin Mary
to say we're sorry...

1298
01:38:26,511 --> 01:38:30,111
because we can't stop
interfering with ourselves.

1299
01:38:30,191 --> 01:38:32,472
- The dong!
- The dong!

1300
01:38:32,552 --> 01:38:34,672
- The prick!
- The prick!

1301
01:38:34,752 --> 01:38:37,592
- The dick!
- The dick!

1302
01:38:37,672 --> 01:38:39,513
- The langer!
- The langer!

1303
01:38:39,593 --> 01:38:41,633
- The excitement!
- The excitement!

1304
01:38:41,713 --> 01:38:45,673
- The excitement?
- Yeah, the excitement.

1305
01:38:45,753 --> 01:38:48,514
Yeah, I heard of that.

1306
01:38:52,394 --> 01:38:56,274
Paddy Clohessy found
a priest to confess our hideous sins to.

1307
01:38:56,354 --> 01:39:01,035
He's 90 years old
and deaf as a turnip.

1308
01:39:01,115 --> 01:39:02,955
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

1309
01:39:03,035 --> 01:39:06,876
It's been ages since me last confession.
I've been masturbating.

1310
01:39:06,956 --> 01:39:09,396
Except one day,
he died and didn't tell us.

1311
01:39:09,476 --> 01:39:12,116
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

1312
01:39:12,196 --> 01:39:14,677
It's been a fort-

1313
01:39:14,757 --> 01:39:19,237
It's been a fortnight
since my last confession.

1314
01:39:19,277 --> 01:39:21,517
And what have you done
since then, my child?

1315
01:39:21,597 --> 01:39:26,358
I, uh, I hit my brother.

1316
01:39:26,438 --> 01:39:28,278
I lied to my mother.

1317
01:39:28,358 --> 01:39:30,798
Yes, my child.
And what else?

1318
01:39:32,279 --> 01:39:35,839
Uh, I did dirty things,
Father.

1319
01:39:35,919 --> 01:39:40,440
Ah, mychild, was that with yourself
or with another?

1320
01:39:40,520 --> 01:39:42,480
Or with some class
of beast?

1321
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:46,000
Beast?

1322
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:48,520
I never heard ofa sin
like that, Father.

1323
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:50,641
This priest
must be from the country.

1324
01:39:50,721 --> 01:39:53,121
He's opening up
new worlds for me.

1325
01:40:09,043 --> 01:40:11,563
I'll just take him up
his last mug of tea.

1326
01:40:44,967 --> 01:40:46,807
It's a disgrace...

1327
01:40:46,887 --> 01:40:49,207
that boys like McCourt...

1328
01:40:49,287 --> 01:40:52,248
and Clarke and Kennedy...

1329
01:40:52,328 --> 01:40:56,968
have to hew wood
and draw water...

1330
01:40:57,048 --> 01:41:01,049
in this so-called free
and independent Ireland...

1331
01:41:01,129 --> 01:41:05,809
that keeps a class system
foisted on us by the English.

1332
01:41:05,889 --> 01:41:08,570
Well, it disgusts me.

1333
01:41:08,650 --> 01:41:12,210
We throw our talented children
onto the dung heap.

1334
01:41:12,290 --> 01:41:14,770
If this is the end
of schooI for you,

1335
01:41:14,850 --> 01:41:18,931
you must get out of this country,
boys, and go to America.

1336
01:41:20,611 --> 01:41:23,171
McCourt, do you hear me?

1337
01:41:23,251 --> 01:41:25,012
I do, sir.

1338
01:41:26,532 --> 01:41:30,052
Laman Griffin
was drunk every night.

1339
01:41:30,132 --> 01:41:33,333
Worst still was Fridays when we had
to watch him eat his fish and chips.

1340
01:41:33,413 --> 01:41:35,533
Woman, boiI some water
for tea.

1341
01:41:35,613 --> 01:41:38,453
We've no coal
or turf.

1342
01:41:38,493 --> 01:41:40,373
You useless
great lump,

1343
01:41:40,413 --> 01:41:42,894
living free under me roof
with you snotty-nosed pack of brats.

1344
01:41:42,974 --> 01:41:45,414
You.

1345
01:41:45,494 --> 01:41:48,534
Go to the shop for a few sods
and some kindling.

1346
01:41:48,614 --> 01:41:51,615
Come on. Or are you as useless
as your mother?

1347
01:41:53,255 --> 01:41:55,575
Did you empty
the chamber pot today?

1348
01:41:55,655 --> 01:41:58,095
Shite.
I left it on the stairs.

1349
01:41:58,175 --> 01:42:01,216
You stand there with your thick gob
and tell me you didn't do it?

1350
01:42:01,296 --> 01:42:04,976
I'm sorry. I forgot.
I'll do it now.

1351
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:08,297
- He couldn't do it.
- Shut up, woman.

1352
01:42:08,377 --> 01:42:10,697
It was his last day at school,
and he had to go to the doctor.

1353
01:42:10,777 --> 01:42:12,497
I said, shut up, woman!

1354
01:42:12,577 --> 01:42:14,497
You can't tell us to shut up.
You're not our father!

1355
01:42:14,577 --> 01:42:18,978
If I have to get up from this table,
you'll be calling for your patron saint.

1356
01:42:19,058 --> 01:42:21,298
Shut your gob.

1357
01:42:21,378 --> 01:42:23,818
I'll kill you!

1358
01:42:23,898 --> 01:42:27,059
- You're not my father!
- Stop it!

1359
01:42:27,139 --> 01:42:29,939
Leave him alone, sweet Jesus.
Stop it!

1360
01:42:30,019 --> 01:42:33,099
He doesn't mean any harm.
He's only a child.

1361
01:42:33,179 --> 01:42:35,140
And he's to start work
at the post office on Monday.

1362
01:42:35,220 --> 01:42:37,060
Give me a fag, woman.

1363
01:42:37,140 --> 01:42:39,700
I'm telling you,
that boy is a little shite.

1364
01:42:39,780 --> 01:42:41,740
I'll talk to him tomorrow.

1365
01:42:41,820 --> 01:42:43,661
I'm going to bed.

1366
01:42:47,981 --> 01:42:50,501
I heard them talking.

1367
01:42:50,581 --> 01:42:53,822
I heard the sound of Laman's boots
as he scraped his way to bed.

1368
01:42:53,862 --> 01:42:56,062
I thought Mam would come
and kiss me goodnight,

1369
01:42:56,142 --> 01:42:59,782
to say thank you
for sticking up forher.

1370
01:43:01,383 --> 01:43:04,023
But no.
She went to him.

1371
01:43:31,106 --> 01:43:33,466
Where are you going, Frankie?

1372
01:43:33,546 --> 01:43:35,387
I'm leaving.

1373
01:43:35,467 --> 01:43:37,307
Why are you leaving,
Frankie?

1374
01:43:37,387 --> 01:43:41,347
Because if I stay,
I'll take a knife to his neck.

1375
01:43:41,427 --> 01:43:44,068
Will you kill him?

1376
01:43:44,148 --> 01:43:46,228
Go to sleep, Malachy.

1377
01:44:46,395 --> 01:44:49,035
You're not having my chips.

1378
01:44:49,115 --> 01:44:53,676
I just wanted to stay
the night, Uncle Pat.

1379
01:44:53,716 --> 01:44:56,036
All right.

1380
01:44:56,116 --> 01:44:58,676
You can stay
in me mother's bed.

1381
01:44:58,756 --> 01:45:01,356
- Don't expect me to feed you, though.
- I won't.

1382
01:45:01,476 --> 01:45:04,757
There's not a scrap offood
in the house.

1383
01:45:08,757 --> 01:45:10,958
What happened
to your face?

1384
01:45:11,038 --> 01:45:13,478
It's all swole.

1385
01:45:13,558 --> 01:45:17,118
Did someone punch you?

1386
01:45:17,198 --> 01:45:19,158
Yeah.

1387
01:45:19,239 --> 01:45:21,679
Who was punching you?

1388
01:45:21,759 --> 01:45:24,079
Joe Louis.

1389
01:45:24,159 --> 01:45:25,959
Joe Louis?

1390
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:30,920
I thought he lived
in America.

1391
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:33,160
Was he visiting
Limerick?

1392
01:45:33,240 --> 01:45:35,120
He was, Uncle Pat.

1393
01:45:35,160 --> 01:45:38,961
That's not right,
him hitting a wee boy...

1394
01:45:39,001 --> 01:45:41,281
and him being heavyweight champion
of America and all.

1395
01:45:41,361 --> 01:45:44,081
The world champion
he is, Uncle Pat.

1396
01:45:44,121 --> 01:45:46,842
That's worse.

1397
01:45:46,922 --> 01:45:49,002
And look at you,
so skinny.

1398
01:45:49,082 --> 01:45:51,442
Those arms wouldn't lift
two stamps.

1399
01:45:53,202 --> 01:45:56,643
Some things
is most peculiar, Frankie.

1400
01:45:58,563 --> 01:46:00,403
I'm off to bed.

1401
01:46:12,845 --> 01:46:14,805
I was so hungry.

1402
01:46:14,885 --> 01:46:17,965
I sat there and licked the front page
and all the headlines.

1403
01:46:18,045 --> 01:46:22,646
I licked the great attacks
of Patton and Montgomery.

1404
01:46:22,686 --> 01:46:24,326
I licked the sports pages.

1405
01:46:24,406 --> 01:46:26,806
I licked the market prices
of eggs and butter and bacon.

1406
01:46:26,886 --> 01:46:31,047
I sucked that paper untiI my face was
as black as Al Jolson's.

1407
01:46:34,167 --> 01:46:36,487
Whoa, boy. Whoa, boy.
Easy. Easy.

1408
01:47:07,411 --> 01:47:09,251
Let's go, Patty.

1409
01:47:11,251 --> 01:47:14,532
We have to get you-
Up you go.

1410
01:47:14,612 --> 01:47:16,692
Come on, Pat,
up the steps.

1411
01:47:16,772 --> 01:47:18,652
How did you let him
get this drunk?

1412
01:47:18,692 --> 01:47:20,572
Drink never hurt anyone,
did it?

1413
01:47:20,612 --> 01:47:23,613
- I want a drink.
- Tomorrow.

1414
01:47:23,693 --> 01:47:25,533
- Push him, Pa.
- I'm pushing. I'm pushing.

1415
01:47:25,613 --> 01:47:27,773
Come on, Pat.

1416
01:47:27,853 --> 01:47:31,774
Christ, you're taking
both sides of the room.

1417
01:47:34,374 --> 01:47:36,814
What are you doing
in this house, in that bed?

1418
01:47:36,894 --> 01:47:39,455
Get up and put the kettle
on for your poor Uncle Pat...

1419
01:47:39,535 --> 01:47:41,535
that fell down
the worse for drink.

1420
01:47:44,055 --> 01:47:47,096
Mother of God!

1421
01:47:47,176 --> 01:47:49,416
You're wearing
me dead mother's dress.

1422
01:47:49,496 --> 01:47:51,536
I washed my clothes
for the big job.

1423
01:47:51,616 --> 01:47:54,976
- What big job?
- Telegram boy at the post office.

1424
01:47:55,056 --> 01:47:57,697
If the post office
are taking on the likes of you,

1425
01:47:57,777 --> 01:48:00,137
- they must be in a desperatestate.
- Ah, Frankie.

1426
01:48:00,217 --> 01:48:02,657
you look... gorgeous.

1427
01:48:02,737 --> 01:48:05,578
Jesus, what did
you wash these in?

1428
01:48:05,658 --> 01:48:08,978
- Carbolic soap.
- They smell like dead pigeons!

1429
01:48:09,058 --> 01:48:11,298
You'll make
a show of us.

1430
01:48:20,779 --> 01:48:22,660
What time do you have to be
at that job?

1431
01:48:22,700 --> 01:48:24,580
9:00.

1432
01:48:24,620 --> 01:48:27,740
Tell them that your aunt was waiting
for you and that's why you're late.

1433
01:48:27,780 --> 01:48:29,780
Late?
Why do I have to be late?

1434
01:48:29,860 --> 01:48:33,501
Just shut up and do what
you're bloody well told.

1435
01:48:34,661 --> 01:48:37,661
Mmm.
That's more like it.

1436
01:48:37,741 --> 01:48:40,582
I often wondered
why Aunt Aggie was always so angry.

1437
01:48:40,662 --> 01:48:42,502
But you're going to need
a new shirt.

1438
01:48:42,582 --> 01:48:44,542
And shoes, not boots.
Shoes.

1439
01:48:44,582 --> 01:48:47,182
Compared to Mam,
she had everything,

1440
01:48:47,262 --> 01:48:49,383
and she didn't have any kids
to keep her poor.

1441
01:48:49,463 --> 01:48:52,863
And here she is buying me clothes
for my new job.

1442
01:48:52,943 --> 01:48:55,303
That's grand.

1443
01:48:55,383 --> 01:48:57,824
Here's two shillings
to get tea and a bun for your birthday.

1444
01:49:00,224 --> 01:49:03,304
You look so smart,
people will think you've robbed a bank.

1445
01:49:12,385 --> 01:49:16,266
She certainly
was a mystery, my Aunt Aggie.

1446
01:49:16,346 --> 01:49:18,586
A complete mystery.

1447
01:49:27,907 --> 01:49:31,748
We know every avenue,
road, street...

1448
01:49:31,828 --> 01:49:35,508
terrace, mews, place,
close and lane.

1449
01:49:35,588 --> 01:49:37,988
You don't have
to have a hanker

1450
01:49:38,068 --> 01:49:40,749
To be a broker
or banker

1451
01:49:40,829 --> 01:49:44,749
No, sirree,just simply be
my mother's son-in-law

1452
01:49:44,829 --> 01:49:47,149
Needn't even think
of tryin'

1453
01:49:47,229 --> 01:49:49,470
To be a mighty
sociaI lion

1454
01:49:49,550 --> 01:49:53,630
Sippin' tea if you will be
my mother's son-in-law

1455
01:49:53,710 --> 01:49:56,150
There isn't a door
in Limerick we don't know.

1456
01:49:56,230 --> 01:49:59,151
We knock on all kinds of doors-
iron, oak, plywood.

1457
01:49:59,231 --> 01:50:03,631
Twenty thousand doors. We knock,
kick, push. We ring and buzz bells.

1458
01:50:05,551 --> 01:50:08,272
Risking life and limb
as we fight off everydog...

1459
01:50:08,312 --> 01:50:10,832
who wants to turn us
into dinner.

1460
01:50:10,912 --> 01:50:13,952
There are telegrams
for the houses of priests.

1461
01:50:14,032 --> 01:50:15,233
God bless you.

1462
01:50:15,313 --> 01:50:17,873
But if you waited for tips
from nuns and priests,

1463
01:50:17,953 --> 01:50:20,553
you'd surely die
on their doorsteps.

1464
01:50:20,713 --> 01:50:22,113
You're lucky to get
the Carmody telegram.

1465
01:50:22,193 --> 01:50:23,193
I am?

1466
01:50:23,273 --> 01:50:25,114
They're big tippers.
You'll get a shilling.

1467
01:50:25,194 --> 01:50:27,034
How come
I got the telegram?

1468
01:50:27,114 --> 01:50:29,074
- 'Cause nobody else will go there.
- Why?

1469
01:50:29,154 --> 01:50:31,314
'Cause Theresa Carmody's
got the consumption.

1470
01:50:37,275 --> 01:50:40,355
You don't have
to speak like that so

1471
01:50:40,435 --> 01:50:42,636
You can tell the world
I said so

1472
01:50:42,676 --> 01:50:47,156
Can't you see you got to be
my mother's son-in-law

1473
01:50:54,197 --> 01:50:56,757
I heard
that sick people like Theresa...

1474
01:50:56,837 --> 01:50:58,678
know that they haven't
got long to live...

1475
01:50:58,758 --> 01:51:02,518
and so it makes them mad
for love and romance...

1476
01:51:02,598 --> 01:51:04,558
and dirty things
ingeneraI.

1477
01:51:04,638 --> 01:51:07,919
- Telegram.
- That's what they say, anyway.

1478
01:51:07,959 --> 01:51:12,679
- You're all wet and bleeding.
- I skidded on me bike.

1479
01:51:12,759 --> 01:51:15,840
Come in. I'll put something
on your cuts.

1480
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:18,320
I wonder should I go in.

1481
01:51:18,360 --> 01:51:20,280
I might get the consumption.

1482
01:51:20,360 --> 01:51:22,960
That'll be the end of me,
and I'll never get to America.

1483
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:26,921
- Come in. You'll perish standing there.
- I need the shilling tip.

1484
01:51:37,002 --> 01:51:39,242
Oh, you big poltroon.

1485
01:51:41,242 --> 01:51:44,363
Now that's better.

1486
01:51:44,443 --> 01:51:48,403
Why don't you take off your clothes
and dry them on the screen there?

1487
01:51:48,483 --> 01:51:50,363
Uh, no.

1488
01:51:50,403 --> 01:51:52,044
Ah, do.

1489
01:51:52,124 --> 01:51:54,884
I will.

1490
01:52:17,567 --> 01:52:20,407
Lord, you might be scrawny,

1491
01:52:20,487 --> 01:52:22,927
but that's a fine boyo
you have there.

1492
01:52:23,087 --> 01:52:27,128
My head is full
of sin and fear of consumption.

1493
01:52:27,208 --> 01:52:29,048
Her green eyes...

1494
01:52:29,128 --> 01:52:32,048
and my shilling tip.

1495
01:52:32,128 --> 01:52:35,409
And she's on top of me,
and I might be killing myself...

1496
01:52:35,449 --> 01:52:37,569
catching consumption
from her mouth.

1497
01:52:37,649 --> 01:52:39,849
I'm riding to heaven.
I'm falling off a cliff.

1498
01:52:39,889 --> 01:52:42,930
And if this is a sin,
I don't give a fiddler's fart.

1499
01:52:47,010 --> 01:52:48,970
Fuck off, you bollocks!

1500
01:52:51,571 --> 01:52:54,731
Your mouth is a lavatory, McCourt.
Did you hear me?

1501
01:52:54,771 --> 01:52:57,851
- I did, Miss Barry.
- You've been heard on the stairs.

1502
01:52:57,931 --> 01:53:00,772
- Yes, Miss Barry.
- Shut up, McCourt.

1503
01:53:00,852 --> 01:53:03,412
- I will, Miss Barry.
- Not another word, McCourt.

1504
01:53:03,492 --> 01:53:05,612
- No, Miss Barry.
- I said shut up, McCourt.

1505
01:53:05,652 --> 01:53:07,252
All right, Miss Barry.

1506
01:53:07,332 --> 01:53:10,813
That's the end of it,
McCourt. Don't try me.

1507
01:53:10,893 --> 01:53:12,493
I- I won't, Miss Barry.

1508
01:53:12,533 --> 01:53:15,613
- Mother of God, give me patience!
- Yes, Miss Barry.

1509
01:53:19,094 --> 01:53:21,014
Take the last word,
McCourt.

1510
01:53:21,094 --> 01:53:23,774
Take it. Take it. Take it!

1511
01:53:28,855 --> 01:53:31,295
I will, Miss Barry.

1512
01:53:50,617 --> 01:53:52,858
What do you want most
in the world?

1513
01:53:54,298 --> 01:53:56,178
To go to America.

1514
01:53:57,818 --> 01:53:59,858
What do you want most?

1515
01:53:59,938 --> 01:54:03,299
Oh, to fall in love
with some gorgeous man.

1516
01:54:03,379 --> 01:54:06,539
Oh, hold me, Frankie.

1517
01:54:28,542 --> 01:54:30,302
Uncle Pat?

1518
01:54:34,062 --> 01:54:36,543
Hello, Frankie.

1519
01:54:46,184 --> 01:54:48,304
How's the job?

1520
01:54:48,384 --> 01:54:51,344
Grand.

1521
01:54:51,424 --> 01:54:53,465
Uncle Pat
lookin' after you?

1522
01:54:53,505 --> 01:54:55,385
He is.

1523
01:54:55,425 --> 01:54:57,985
But I can
look after meself.

1524
01:54:59,625 --> 01:55:01,505
That's good.

1525
01:55:01,585 --> 01:55:05,066
- You're getting enough to eat, I see.
- lam.

1526
01:55:05,146 --> 01:55:07,066
Would you like a chip?

1527
01:55:07,106 --> 01:55:09,386
No.

1528
01:55:14,307 --> 01:55:17,027
Michael and little Alphie
are fine.

1529
01:55:17,107 --> 01:55:19,027
That's good.

1530
01:55:20,148 --> 01:55:22,468
We all miss Malachy.
He's, uh-

1531
01:55:22,548 --> 01:55:25,748
- Miss him? He-
- He's gone to join the army band!

1532
01:55:25,828 --> 01:55:28,669
- Playin' the bugle.
- The bugle?

1533
01:55:28,709 --> 01:55:31,389
Can you imagine that, playin' the bugle?
Playin' the fool, more like.

1534
01:55:31,429 --> 01:55:36,029
That's Malachy, all right.

1535
01:55:36,069 --> 01:55:38,070
Mad Malachy.

1536
01:55:45,951 --> 01:55:49,151
I miss him too.

1537
01:56:17,514 --> 01:56:20,114
- Telegram, Mrs. Carmody.
- Thank you.

1538
01:56:20,195 --> 01:56:24,035
I usually deliver the telegram
to your daughter.

1539
01:56:24,075 --> 01:56:26,635
- Theresa, isn't it?
- Theresa's in the sanatorium.

1540
01:56:45,037 --> 01:56:48,998
Please, God,
it wasn't Theresa's fault.

1541
01:56:49,078 --> 01:56:53,038
The excitement on the sofa
is what the consumption does to you.

1542
01:56:53,118 --> 01:56:55,079
I love her, God,

1543
01:56:55,119 --> 01:56:58,879
just like St. Francis loved
any bird or beast or fish.

1544
01:56:58,959 --> 01:57:01,679
Please, God,
take the consumption away,

1545
01:57:01,719 --> 01:57:03,960
and I promise I'll never
go near her again.

1546
01:57:19,561 --> 01:57:23,002
Anima eius, et animae
omnium fidelium defunctorum,

1547
01:57:23,082 --> 01:57:27,282
per misericordiam Dei,
requiescant in pacem.

1548
01:57:28,322 --> 01:57:30,403
Amen.

1549
01:57:34,643 --> 01:57:37,603
I want to tell
the priest and Theresa's mam and dad...

1550
01:57:37,683 --> 01:57:40,724
that it was me, Frank McCourt,
the dirty rotten thing...

1551
01:57:40,804 --> 01:57:42,924
that sent Theresa
straight to hell.

1552
01:57:45,364 --> 01:57:48,845
I think of Theresa,
cold in her coffin,

1553
01:57:48,885 --> 01:57:51,245
the red hair,
the green eyes.

1554
01:57:53,005 --> 01:57:54,885
I can't understand
what I feeI,

1555
01:57:54,965 --> 01:57:58,766
but I know that with all the people
who died in my family...

1556
01:57:58,806 --> 01:58:01,686
and all the people who died
in the lanes around me,

1557
01:58:01,766 --> 01:58:04,526
I never had a pain like this
in my heart,

1558
01:58:04,567 --> 01:58:06,767
and I hope
Inever will again.

1559
01:58:11,127 --> 01:58:13,848
And then, as luck would have it,
I had to deliver a telegram...

1560
01:58:13,928 --> 01:58:15,928
to the moneylender,
Mrs. Finucane,

1561
01:58:16,008 --> 01:58:18,808
and St. Francis
smiled down on me once more.

1562
01:58:27,249 --> 01:58:29,409
How old are you, boy?

1563
01:58:29,489 --> 01:58:31,810
Fifteen and some, missus.

1564
01:58:31,890 --> 01:58:33,850
Old enough
and ugly enough.

1565
01:58:33,930 --> 01:58:35,770
Yes, missus.

1566
01:58:35,850 --> 01:58:38,370
But are you smart, boy?
Are you in any way intelligent?

1567
01:58:39,411 --> 01:58:41,291
I can read and write,
Mrs. Finucane.

1568
01:58:41,371 --> 01:58:43,531
There are people in the lunatic asylum
can read and write.

1569
01:58:43,611 --> 01:58:46,211
- Can you write a letter?
- I can, Mrs. Finucane.

1570
01:58:46,291 --> 01:58:49,132
I'll give you three pence
for every letter you write,

1571
01:58:49,212 --> 01:58:51,132
and three pence if it
brings in a payment.

1572
01:58:51,212 --> 01:58:55,092
Come on Thursday. Bring your own paper
and envelopes with you.

1573
01:58:58,133 --> 01:59:01,213
"O'Brien, Donnolley,
Meagher, Hannon,

1574
01:59:01,293 --> 01:59:03,733
old Mrs. Keneally,
Mulcahy, Ahern. "

1575
01:59:03,773 --> 01:59:06,334
We'll see how you do
with that lot for a start.

1576
01:59:06,414 --> 01:59:10,094
Threaten them, boy.
Threaten the life out of them.

1577
01:59:11,254 --> 01:59:13,414
How does this sound?

1578
01:59:13,494 --> 01:59:15,335
"Dear Mrs. O'Brien:

1579
01:59:15,415 --> 01:59:19,415
In as much as you have not seen fit
to pay me what you owe me,

1580
01:59:19,455 --> 01:59:21,775
I may be forced
to resort to legal action.

1581
01:59:21,855 --> 01:59:26,576
There's your son, MichaeI, parading
around the world in his new suit,

1582
01:59:26,656 --> 01:59:28,416
which I paid for,

1583
01:59:28,496 --> 01:59:32,857
while I myself have barely a crust
to keep body and soul together. "

1584
01:59:32,937 --> 01:59:37,177
"I am sure you don't want to languish
in the dungeons of Limerick jail,

1585
01:59:37,217 --> 01:59:39,257
far from friends
and family.

1586
01:59:39,337 --> 01:59:42,498
I remain yours
in lit- lit-"

1587
01:59:42,578 --> 01:59:45,498
- What are these words, boy?
- Litigious anticipation.

1588
01:59:46,818 --> 01:59:48,698
That's a powerful letter.

1589
01:59:50,019 --> 01:59:53,059
This word, "in as much. "

1590
01:59:53,139 --> 01:59:56,219
That's a holy terror of a word.
What does it mean?

1591
01:59:56,259 --> 01:59:59,220
It means,
"this is your last chance. "

1592
02:00:01,100 --> 02:00:03,420
She gives me money for stamps,

1593
02:00:03,500 --> 02:00:06,381
but I deliver the letters myself
and keep the money.

1594
02:00:27,343 --> 02:00:31,983
What class of a demon would torment
her own kind with a letter like that?

1595
02:00:32,023 --> 02:00:35,584
It's truly awful.

1596
02:00:35,664 --> 02:00:37,184
What's up with Mrs. Hannon?

1597
02:00:37,264 --> 02:00:40,304
That old bitch Finucane sent her
a threatening letter. Look.

1598
02:00:40,384 --> 02:00:42,865
People who write letters
like that should be boiled in oil...

1599
02:00:42,945 --> 02:00:45,705
and then have their fingernails
pulled out by blind people.

1600
02:00:47,985 --> 02:00:49,906
That's great.
Thanks very much. Next, please.

1601
02:00:51,386 --> 02:00:53,346
I'm sorry for their troubles,

1602
02:00:53,426 --> 02:00:56,906
but there's no other way for me to save
the money for the trip to America.

1603
02:00:59,907 --> 02:01:02,347
If the whole of Ireland
was dying of hunger,

1604
02:01:02,427 --> 02:01:05,187
I wouldn't touch this money
in the post office.

1605
02:01:05,307 --> 02:01:08,628
Thanks, John.
Listen here to me, men.

1606
02:01:08,708 --> 02:01:10,548
Listen a second.

1607
02:01:10,588 --> 02:01:13,388
This is my nephew here, Frankie McCourt,
the son of Angela Sheehan,

1608
02:01:13,468 --> 02:01:15,308
the sister of my wife,
having his first pint.

1609
02:01:15,388 --> 02:01:17,629
Here's to your health
and long life, Frankie.

1610
02:01:17,669 --> 02:01:20,869
May you live to enjoy the pint,
but not too much, eh?

1611
02:01:26,590 --> 02:01:29,110
Slow down, slow down.

1612
02:01:29,150 --> 02:01:31,670
Don't drink it
all at once.

1613
02:01:31,750 --> 02:01:37,271
In Mountjoy jail
one Monday morning

1614
02:01:37,351 --> 02:01:42,112
High upon
the gallows tree

1615
02:01:42,192 --> 02:01:46,872
Kevin Barry
gave his young life

1616
02:01:46,912 --> 02:01:51,113
For the cause
of liberty

1617
02:01:54,113 --> 02:01:59,233
Just a lad
of 18 summers

1618
02:01:59,273 --> 02:02:01,834
And no-

1619
02:02:10,115 --> 02:02:12,955
What kind of state
is that to come home in?

1620
02:02:17,156 --> 02:02:19,076
Up, boys, up!

1621
02:02:19,156 --> 02:02:21,476
The Red Branch Knights!

1622
02:02:21,516 --> 02:02:23,876
The Fenian men!

1623
02:02:23,916 --> 02:02:26,077
The glorious I.R.A.!

1624
02:02:26,117 --> 02:02:28,797
I can't believe you.
It's your father you've become.

1625
02:02:28,837 --> 02:02:30,797
Tonight-

1626
02:02:34,318 --> 02:02:36,198
Tonight, I had
me first pint.

1627
02:02:36,238 --> 02:02:38,838
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

1628
02:02:38,918 --> 02:02:41,118
My first pint
with Uncle Pa.

1629
02:02:41,158 --> 02:02:43,159
Uncle Pa should know better.

1630
02:02:43,239 --> 02:02:46,519
No father around
to get me my first pint.

1631
02:02:46,599 --> 02:02:49,199
Your father was no good
to anyone, and neither are you.

1632
02:02:49,279 --> 02:02:51,199
You're just like him,
you drunken feck!

1633
02:02:51,279 --> 02:02:56,400
I'd rather be like my father
than like your Laman Griffin!

1634
02:02:56,480 --> 02:02:58,680
Mind your tongue.
You're drunk.

1635
02:02:58,760 --> 02:03:02,001
Mind your own tongue.

1636
02:03:02,081 --> 02:03:04,601
You and Laman Griffin!

1637
02:03:05,961 --> 02:03:08,962
You slut!

1638
02:03:09,002 --> 02:03:11,562
You've a mouth on you worse than
your drunken eejit father!

1639
02:03:11,642 --> 02:03:14,562
Better to be like
my drunken eejit father than like...

1640
02:03:14,642 --> 02:03:17,963
that fat, disgustin' shite
Laman Griffin,

1641
02:03:18,003 --> 02:03:20,323
who you crept up to every night
there back at Rosbrien!

1642
02:03:20,363 --> 02:03:23,763
- Shut up!
- Laman Griffin. Laman Griffin.

1643
02:03:23,843 --> 02:03:26,323
Up in the loft
with Laman Griffin!

1644
02:03:26,404 --> 02:03:28,324
Squeak, squeak, squeak,

1645
02:03:28,364 --> 02:03:30,764
with fat Laman Griffi n
rollin' on top of you!

1646
02:03:30,804 --> 02:03:33,804
- Shut up! Shut up!
- You fuckin' shut up, you slut!

1647
02:04:04,488 --> 02:04:08,008
My child. Tell me what troubles you.

1648
02:04:10,289 --> 02:04:13,769
- I'm 16 today, Father.
- Mm-hmm?

1649
02:04:13,809 --> 02:04:17,249
- I drank my first pint last night.
- Yeah.

1650
02:04:19,250 --> 02:04:21,450
I hit my mother.

1651
02:04:23,090 --> 02:04:25,130
God help us.

1652
02:04:28,331 --> 02:04:30,211
But He will forgive you.

1653
02:04:31,411 --> 02:04:33,451
Is there anything else?

1654
02:04:33,491 --> 02:04:35,371
I can't tell you, Father.

1655
02:04:35,411 --> 02:04:38,612
Would you like
to go to confession?

1656
02:04:38,652 --> 02:04:41,572
I- I can't, Father.

1657
02:04:41,652 --> 02:04:45,413
- I did terrible things.
- Well, you can tell St. Francis.

1658
02:04:45,493 --> 02:04:47,413
You can tell St. Francis.

1659
02:04:49,053 --> 02:04:52,733
We'll sit here, and you can tell
St. Francis...

1660
02:04:52,813 --> 02:04:55,214
all the things
that trouble you.

1661
02:04:58,774 --> 02:05:03,855
I tell St. Francis
about Margaret, Oliver, Eugene.

1662
02:05:05,175 --> 02:05:07,055
He treads
the upper-

1663
02:05:08,855 --> 02:05:11,496
My father singing "Kevin Barry"
and bringing home no money.

1664
02:05:14,256 --> 02:05:17,016
My father sending
no money from England.

1665
02:05:17,096 --> 02:05:20,137
Theresa on the sofa.

1666
02:05:20,217 --> 02:05:23,537
My terrible sins
of interfering with myself,

1667
02:05:23,617 --> 02:05:25,617
wankin' all over Limerick
and beyond.

1668
02:05:25,657 --> 02:05:26,857
What do you want?

1669
02:05:26,937 --> 02:05:29,778
The Christian Brother who
closed the door in my face.

1670
02:05:30,938 --> 02:05:33,058
The tears in Mam's eyes
when I slapped her.

1671
02:05:38,379 --> 02:05:42,139
A- A-And I give her me back
this morning, Father,

1672
02:05:42,219 --> 02:05:46,460
even though it's me birthday
and she offered me a cup of tea.

1673
02:05:49,220 --> 02:05:51,980
Ego te absolvo
apeccatis tuis.

1674
02:05:52,060 --> 02:05:56,221
In nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.

1675
02:05:56,261 --> 02:06:00,341
Say three Our Fathers,
three Hail Marys and three Glory Bes.

1676
02:06:02,301 --> 02:06:05,262
But what about Theresa Carmody
in hell, Father?

1677
02:06:05,342 --> 02:06:08,062
No, my child,
surely she is in heaven.

1678
02:06:08,102 --> 02:06:12,183
You don't think the sisters in the
hospital let her die without a priest?

1679
02:06:12,223 --> 02:06:14,463
- Are you sure, Father?
- I am.

1680
02:06:14,543 --> 02:06:16,503
God forgives you,
and you must forgive yourself.

1681
02:06:16,543 --> 02:06:18,823
God loves you,
and you must love yourself.

1682
02:06:18,903 --> 02:06:22,904
For only when you love God and yourself
can you love all God's creatures.

1683
02:06:35,265 --> 02:06:37,625
Thank you, St. Francis.

1684
02:06:58,468 --> 02:07:00,868
Mrs. Finucane.

1685
02:07:00,908 --> 02:07:02,908
It's Frank.
I have your sherry.

1686
02:08:24,358 --> 02:08:26,518
All the names are here.

1687
02:08:26,598 --> 02:08:28,878
Me Mam.
two pounds for Christmas.

1688
02:08:28,958 --> 02:08:31,399
Aunt Aggie.
nine pounds.

1689
02:08:31,479 --> 02:08:33,479
Maybe for
my post office clothes.

1690
02:08:33,559 --> 02:08:36,599
Bridey Hannon forointment
for Mr. Hannon's legs.

1691
02:08:36,679 --> 02:08:41,760
Mrs. Purcell, Clohessy,
Quigley, Molloy.

1692
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:45,720
Everyone I know and half of the poor
of Limerick are here.

1693
02:08:45,800 --> 02:08:49,081
They allowed
the old bitch money.

1694
02:08:49,161 --> 02:08:51,441
Well, not anymore.

1695
02:09:09,883 --> 02:09:12,603
Not to America,
not by plane.

1696
02:09:12,683 --> 02:09:15,404
I can put you
on a ship, though,

1697
02:09:15,444 --> 02:09:18,324
that leaves Cork in a couple of weeks.
the Irish Oak.

1698
02:09:18,404 --> 02:09:21,684
That'll cost you 55 pounds.
Do you have it?

1699
02:09:23,605 --> 02:09:25,725
I do.

1700
02:09:27,685 --> 02:09:31,806
And as he was
leaving his mother

1701
02:09:31,886 --> 02:09:35,606
Standing upon the quay

1702
02:09:35,646 --> 02:09:39,326
She threw her arms
around his waist

1703
02:09:39,406 --> 02:09:42,647
- And this to him didsay
- Here you are.

1704
02:09:42,727 --> 02:09:44,207
Everybody now.

1705
02:09:44,247 --> 02:09:49,128
A mother's love's
a blessing

1706
02:09:49,208 --> 02:09:53,648
No matter
where you roam

1707
02:09:53,688 --> 02:09:57,288
Keep her while she's living

1708
02:09:57,368 --> 02:10:01,529
You'll miss her
when she's gone

1709
02:10:01,569 --> 02:10:05,649
Love her
as in childhood

1710
02:10:05,729 --> 02:10:09,250
Though feeble, old and grey

1711
02:10:09,330 --> 02:10:13,610
For you'll never miss
a mother's love

1712
02:10:13,690 --> 02:10:16,691
Till she's buried
beneath the clay

1713
02:10:16,731 --> 02:10:19,451
Fair play to you, Angela.
That was mighty.

1714
02:10:19,491 --> 02:10:22,451
Well, Frankie, your bladder must be
very close to your eye.

1715
02:10:22,491 --> 02:10:24,932
This night is turning into
a proper wake altogether.

1716
02:10:25,012 --> 02:10:26,012
Is there any possibility...

1717
02:10:26,092 --> 02:10:28,532
of somebody singing something
to liven up the proceedings...

1718
02:10:28,572 --> 02:10:30,252
before I'm driven to drink
from sadness?

1719
02:10:30,332 --> 02:10:32,172
- Oh, I forgot!
- What?

1720
02:10:32,252 --> 02:10:34,213
The eclipse.
The moon is having an eclipse tonight.

1721
02:10:34,293 --> 02:10:36,213
- What's an eclipse?
- Come on, all of you.

1722
02:10:36,293 --> 02:10:38,653
We'd look a right shower of eejits
if we missed that.

1723
02:10:48,574 --> 02:10:50,935
What's gonna happen?

1724
02:10:51,015 --> 02:10:54,295
This is a very good sign
for you going to America, Frankie.

1725
02:10:54,335 --> 02:10:59,096
It's a bad sign. I read that the moon
is practicing for the end of the world.

1726
02:10:59,136 --> 02:11:01,296
End of the world,
my arse.

1727
02:11:18,098 --> 02:11:20,578
Would you look at that!

1728
02:11:26,179 --> 02:11:29,699
- Well, isn't that somethin'?
- Wow! Isn't that grand?

1729
02:11:31,859 --> 02:11:34,540
- It's beautifuI.
- We might never see that again.

1730
02:11:34,620 --> 02:11:37,060
Not in our life time,
anyway.

1731
02:11:41,220 --> 02:11:43,301
Was that it, then?

1732
02:11:46,661 --> 02:11:49,261
'Tis only the beginning
for Frankie McCourt.

1733
02:11:49,341 --> 02:11:54,102
He'll be back in a few years with a new
suit and fat on his bones like any Yank.

1734
02:11:54,182 --> 02:11:57,942
Anda lovely girI with pearly white
teeth, and her hangin' from his arm.

1735
02:11:58,022 --> 02:11:59,623
Ah, no, Pa.

1736
02:12:03,783 --> 02:12:06,463
Come on back inside, Angela,
and we'll have a drop of sherry.

1737
02:12:10,624 --> 02:12:13,944
- Good luck in America, Frankie.
- Good luck to you.

1738
02:12:36,307 --> 02:12:38,467
Good luck to ya, Frankie.
