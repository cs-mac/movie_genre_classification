1
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,800
Are we shooting?

2
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,240
What?

3
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,800
Are we shooting people or what?

4
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,280
Are we shooting?

5
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,520
That's what I'm asking you!

6
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,640
What's the answer?

7
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:50,800
I don't know the answer!
That's what I'm trying to find out!

8
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,600
- Give me some gum.
- I already gave you some.

9
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,960
I can see a grain of sand in there.
I just can't get it out.

10
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,720
I think this guy has a weapon!

11
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,320
Yeah, he does!

12
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,080
Congratulations, my man,
you shot yourself a raghead!

13
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,360
Dag. Didn't think I'd get to see
anybody shot in this war.

14
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,880
Take my picture.

15
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,720
Spirits are high
and the music is boisterous...

16
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,760
...as these young troops-
Shit, hold on a second.

17
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:17,720
Music is high and spirits are soaring
as these- Did I just say "soaring"?

18
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,840
How did it sound?

19
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,840
They say you exorcised the ghost of
Vietnam with a clear moral imperative.

20
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,440
We liberated IKuwait.

21
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,480
And I had to start again
With just my children and my wife

22
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,600
I would thank my lucky stars
To be living here today

23
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,920
Because the flag
Still stands for freedom

24
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,320
And they can't take that away

25
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,640
And I gladly stand up next to you

26
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,560
And defend her still today

27
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,960
'Cause there ain't no doubt
I love this land

28
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,960
God bless the U.S.A.

29
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,960
Trained warrior! Trained warrior!

30
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,520
Trained warrior! Oh, my God!
Major Gates!

31
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,000
What's Adriana got?

32
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,200
Just the celebration story.

33
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,240
That's it? That story's evaporating.

34
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,480
The Iraqi POW story's evaporating.

35
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,360
Still have my gold story, though.
Returning the gold to IKuwait.

36
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,080
What do you know about that?

37
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,360
They think it's
in a bunker somewhere.

38
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,000
- What's going on?
- I was about to ask you the same.

39
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,400
You said he was former Delta, he'd take
care of me. What a bunch of bullshit!

40
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,680
- Let me handle this!
- Doesn't she have an escort?

41
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,720
- She's right here.
- Find her someone to fuck...

42
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,480
- ... so she'll leave my escort alone.
- That's unnecessary.

43
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,320
I don't want him going to other
reporters and giving away my stories.

44
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,240
- You don't have any stories.
- You don't tell people that!

45
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,360
Look at what's become of you!

46
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,480
Yes, look at me.
I've got my clothes on! I'm dressed!

47
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,600
I will say you're old, Adriana.

48
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,200
I really don't need this shit, major.
You understand me?

49
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,960
This is a media war!
And you better get onboard!

50
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,240
We'll talk tomorrow,
and I'll straight you out!

51
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,560
Take a picture!

52
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,400
One more!

53
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,720
Very handsome.

54
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,640
Good shot, Barlow!

55
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,440
Enough!

56
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,320
Captain's coming!

57
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,600
You better move your butts.
He's coming right now!

58
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,920
Goddamn it! Where the hell did this
booze come from? Get rid of it!

59
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,320
We gotta take more
Iraqi prisoners tomorrow! Tomorrow!

60
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,480
Remove the magazine from your weapon.

61
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,000
Sling your weapon over your left
shoulder, muzzle down.

62
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,640
Have both arms raised above your head.

63
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,080
Approach the multinational forces
position slowly...

64
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,040
...with the lead soldier
holding this document...

65
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,720
...above his head. If you do this,
you will not die.

66
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,840
You will be processed
as prisoners of war...

67
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,960
...provided food, shelter and clothing.

68
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,000
Do not resist.

69
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,600
If you do this, you get this.

70
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,800
If you surrender,
you will get food and shelter. Okay?

71
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,880
Everything's cool. Nobody's gonna
hurt you. Just relax.

72
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,800
Sir, you'll have to
take the turban off as well.

73
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,120
Did you rape and torture anyone
in IKuwait?

74
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,200
What about you, motherfucker?!

75
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,400
You're making them hysterical.
Stop that. You'll get us in trouble.

76
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,480
Relax. We want everybody facedown.

77
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,640
Come on.

78
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,960
Get down.

79
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,040
Take these things off.
No comprende English?

80
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,280
What is your fucking problem?!

81
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,560
Act in a more
professional manner, please.

82
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,560
I want to be professional.
He won't take his rags off.

83
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,080
Pay attention to how it's done.
Excuse me, sir.

84
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,360
We'll need you to disrobe like all
the other towelheads.

85
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,680
I hate to see it come to this.
Strip him down.

86
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,520
Come on, motherfucker.

87
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,160
Take your fucking clothes off.

88
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,360
Come on!

89
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,120
Troy, come here! Check this out.

90
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,080
Freaky thing here, possibly!

91
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,840
There's a document in that guy's ass.

92
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,640
We got a classified situation.

93
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,760
You think he ate it?

94
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,400
It wouldn't come out
perfect like that.

95
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,680
Pull it out, private.

96
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,040
Pull it out.

97
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,080
Man, I didn't join the Army to pull
paper out of people's asses.

98
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,440
No, sir. Not what I signed up for.

99
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,040
Open it up.

100
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,040
You only gave me one glove.

101
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,280
I only have one,
but you have to open it.

102
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,880
That's how the chain of command works.

103
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,320
What is it?

104
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,280
It's important enough
to squeeze your cheeks for.

105
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,760
You're supposed to make her feel good
about the stories we want.

106
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,240
You don't walk away from her
and go screw another journalist!

107
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,360
I never wanted this job, Ron.

108
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,840
Your work in Iraq was over. Done!

109
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,080
I'm trying to help you.
If you play your cards right...

110
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,760
...she may hook you up with
the media at home.

111
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,880
Fuck that.

112
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,040
Where you going?

113
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,920
You got your star clinched.

114
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,240
So it's my fault that you
plateaued a long time ago.

115
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,840
I don't even know what we did here.

116
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,200
Just tell me what we did here, Ron.

117
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,760
You want to occupy Iraq
and do Vietnam again?

118
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,800
Is that your brilliant idea?

119
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,400
- I'm retiring anyway.
- Until you do, you're an Army officer.

120
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,560
You're still taking care of that
reporter, so do it right.

121
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,880
You've washed your hands
a thousand times.

122
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,440
Lord knows what vermin
live in the butt of a dune coon.

123
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,200
Why do you let this cracker
follow you around?

124
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,720
He's from a group home in Dallas.
He doesn't know better.

125
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,000
Don't tell people that.

126
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,760
I don't care if he's from
Johannesburg.

127
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,440
I don't want to hear "dune coon" or
"sand nigger" from him or anybody.

128
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,640
Captain uses those terms.

129
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,720
The point is, "towelhead" and "camel
jockey" are good substitutes.

130
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,560
- Exactly.
- I apologize.

131
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,120
It's confusing with all this pro-Saudi,
anti-Iraqi type language and all that.

132
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,280
Did you get the aerials?

133
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,280
How'd you get those?

134
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,920
- Chief is hooked up.
- IKeep Walter on that door.

135
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,080
Would you take those fucking things off?

136
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,960
I never got to use night vision.

137
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,880
They do not work during the day!

138
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,600
They kind of work.

139
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,560
Just stand outside so Chief can
translate my Iraqi ass map, okay?

140
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,640
Are you ready to work with me now?

141
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,960
I'm ready to work with you.

142
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,520
Good. Because I've got
an amazing lead.

143
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,000
- It was in his ass.
- That's not the real story.

144
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,480
- What's the real story?
- It was in the guy's dick.

145
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,160
Pulled it out with tweezers.

146
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,800
A 10-page atlas of Saddam's bunkers?

147
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,800
Only real small, like those books you
get in a box of Cracker Jacks.

148
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,400
They pull it out the guy ear.

149
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,440
- What?
- "Out of his ear. "

150
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,760
Maybe out the nose.

151
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,320
- What's he saying?
- "The nose. "

152
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,520
- Tell me what body part.
- Let me handle this.

153
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,920
It was stitched in back of his head.

154
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,480
The back of his head.

155
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,000
- Who is the guy?
- What guy?

156
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,480
The guy who found it!

157
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,120
- I cannot tell you.
- Fuck that!

158
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,880
- You said you could.
- Not now.

159
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,800
This guy doesn't know shit.

160
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
He doesn't know shit.

161
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,160
Listen to me. This guy is French
Special Forces, and he can help us.

162
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,920
- He can?
- Yes, and he's my friend.

163
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,400
But he won't talk to me
if you're around.

164
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,400
You better not be fucking with me.

165
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,320
- I want the story this time.
- You'll get the story.

166
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,360
These have to be Saddam's bunkers
between IKarbala and Nazaria.

167
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,480
What's inside?

168
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,720
According to Intel, Picasso, Sony,
Armani, Rolex...

169
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,080
IKuwait was the Arab Beverly Hills,
and Saddam jacked them for it.

170
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,280
I'd like to bring something home
besides sand fleas.

171
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,920
One Rolex would get me a very nice
house outside of Garland.

172
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,120
Five would get
a Lexus convertible.

173
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,280
- Lexus doesn't make one.
- Yes, they do.

174
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,080
It has room for a kid seat.

175
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,360
- Infiniti has a convertible, not Lexus.
- Wrong.

176
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,560
The good Lord put this map in our path,
and I believe we'll find something.

177
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,280
He could also put a land mine
in our path.

178
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,480
I don't think so. I've been fire
baptized, and this feels safe.

179
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,960
What are you talking about?

180
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,080
I have a ring of Jesus fire
to guide my decisions.

181
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,640
You're putting me on, right?

182
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,480
Do I look like I'm putting you on?

183
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,320
Okay, ring of Jesus fire.

184
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,560
Halt!

185
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,640
Freeze, motherfucker!

186
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,920
Sir, this tent is restricted.

187
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,800
Get out of my way.

188
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,160
Mayday! Mayday! Goddamn it!

189
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,320
Good afternoon.

190
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,840
Would this be the proctology tent?

191
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,440
No, sir.

192
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,400
Maybe it's a urology tent.

193
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,200
Or the neurology tent.

194
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,640
Or the ear, nose and throat tent.

195
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,880
Captain's at a staff meeting, sir.

196
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,640
Captain a proctologist?

197
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,480
What's a proctologist, sir?

198
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,160
Doesn't matter.

199
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,560
I'm not looking for him.
I'm looking for Barlow.

200
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,160
You're on the path to truth when you
smell shit. Isn't that what they say?

201
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,720
I don't recognize you, sir.
Are you in this division?

202
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,840
He's not from this division.
He's Special Forces.

203
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,520
Did you present this map
to your captain?

204
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,240
Not yet, sir.

205
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,960
I'll take it to him.

206
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,120
That's not necessary, sir.
I can take it to him.

207
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,880
Don't get grabby, sergeant.

208
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,360
He's our C.O.
I'd have to tell him you took it.

209
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,960
That won't do either of us any good,
will it?

210
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,000
No, sir.

211
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,000
Sit down.

212
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,920
- What do you see here?
- Bunkers, sir.

213
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,680
- What's in them?
- Stuff they stole from IKuwait.

214
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,480
Bullshit. I'm talking about millions
in IKuwaiti bullions.

215
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,440
The little cubes you put in
hot water and make soup?

216
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,440
No, not the little cubes you put in hot
water to make soup.

217
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,640
Gold bricks.

218
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,880
Saddam stole it from the sheiks. I have
no problem stealing it from Saddam.

219
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,440
My guess is, he's divided these bricks
into several different stashes.

220
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,000
Just one stash would be easy for us to
take from his deserting army.

221
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,760
That'd be enough to get us
out of our day jobs.

222
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,080
Unless you reservists are
in love with your day jobs.

223
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,520
I don't really have a day job, sir.

224
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,160
First thing we have to do is...

225
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,600
...make sure this is more than
a love letter to an Iraqi.

226
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,000
It's a series of bunkers
outside IKarbala, sir.

227
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,320
- Maybe.
- Definitely, sir.

228
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,280
The recon photos match.

229
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,840
We'll see.

230
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,640
Dag!

231
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,320
It's what makes SF so badass.
We got the best flashlights.

232
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,600
Still looks like a series of bunkers.

233
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,760
Three villages a little farther
to the east.

234
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,520
- Seventy-five clicks north.
- More like 65.

235
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,440
Way north of any allied troops.

236
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,120
Perfect. We don't want
any troops around.

237
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,120
Just us and a Humvee
up by the Euphrates River Valley.

238
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,040
Where they put Moses in the basket.

239
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,600
That's Egypt.

240
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,600
We three kings be stealing the gold

241
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,680
Quiet down!

242
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,920
My friends all drive Porsches
I must make amends

243
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,280
Will you shut up?

244
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,120
Are you done singing?

245
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,800
What about mines, sir?

246
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,720
Grid was swept by the 82nd.
We'll stick to the roads.

247
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,640
Will we need a deuce-and-a-half?

248
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,560
- It's easier in a Humvee.
- What if we have a lot to carry?

249
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,360
We'll grab an Iraqi truck.
It's better cover.

250
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,120
- We could say we captured it.
- That's right.

251
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,080
We leave at dawn, back before lunch.
No big deal.

252
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,360
- What's the guy's name outside?
- Walter, sir.

253
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,160
Bolo! Get in here!

254
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,400
- Who's Bolo?
- A guy who doesn't know what he's doing.

255
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,800
Yes, sir.

256
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,240
Get this reporter off my back.
You know who Adriana Cruz is?

257
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,360
- Reporter on NBS, sir.
- That's right.

258
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,760
Tell her I'm checking a story,
and you're bringing her to meet me.

259
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,560
- In Iraq?
- No.

260
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,240
I'll give you a fake copy of this map.

261
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,600
Take her on a ride
that lasts all morning...

262
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,600
...and goes nowhere near the villages
outside IKarbala.

263
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,920
When you don't find me, it'll be because
you got lost. Is that clear?

264
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,520
Any other questions?

265
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,560
Is it true that to be SF,
you got to cut off an enemy's ear?

266
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:22,000
- Are you able to control him?
- Yes, sir. He'll be fine.

267
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,160
Let's get ready to roll in the morning.

268
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,240
All right, here we go, ma'am!

269
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,440
Pull!

270
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,560
Pull!

271
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,880
Let me get some, Chief!

272
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,160
I gave you a better arc!

273
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,320
What do you mean?

274
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,480
I threw the ball at a higher arc.

275
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,560
Bullshit!

276
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,840
Blacks make better receivers
than quarterbacks.

277
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,200
Stop speaking right now.

278
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,480
Warren Moon is one of the best
in the league.

279
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,320
Houston's gone nowhere with Warren Moon.

280
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,160
- Randall Cunningham?
- Don't get in the mud with him.

281
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,600
Eagles'll never get to
Super Bowl with Cunningham.

282
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,600
Doug Williams not only took the Redskins
to the Super Bowl, but they won!

283
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,240
We can all agree there are many
excellent black quarterbacks.

284
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,760
Let's see what you can hit.

285
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,400
Sorry-ass cracker!
You'll never hit no Iraqi!

286
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,200
I'll hit an Iraqi.
I'll blow his head off!

287
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,000
If he talks like that, ignore him,
or it'll get worse.

288
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,920
You're right.
Just can't help myself sometimes.

289
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,320
Watch this!

290
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,600
- What was that?
- A rigged football C-4, sir.

291
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,920
Why'd you do that?

292
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,880
You said we could fire some rounds
when we left camp.

293
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,440
I said you could fire a few rounds.

294
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,520
We didn't get to see any action.

295
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:11,600
- You want to see some action?
- Yeah, I do, sir.

296
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,480
Is this what you're after?

297
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,000
We dropped a lot of bombs out here.

298
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,400
We also buried a lot of guys alive.

299
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,640
The only action we seen was on CNN,
except for that dude Troy shot.

300
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,160
- Shot him in the neck?
- That's right, sir.

301
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,200
Fucking badass. I was there.
Took him out at 400 yards.

302
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,080
Head popped up in the air.

303
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,280
Crazy shot, man!

304
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,480
You know anything about gunshot wounds?

305
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,120
- I don't know.
- Specifically.

306
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,720
The worst thing about a gunshot,
provided you survive the bullet...

307
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,080
...is sepsis.

308
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,440
Infection of the blood.

309
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,560
Say a bullet tears into you-

310
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,320
Creates a cavity of dead tissue.
That cavity...

311
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,360
...it fills up with bile and bacteria.
You're fucked.

312
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,680
But we're going to do this without
firing any shots...

313
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,240
...and just to be sure,
we'll do a dry run.

314
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,080
So get your suits on.

315
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,640
Now, we will say that the cow is a
primary guard outside the bunker.

316
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,320
Pull up fast, stop short.

317
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,520
Move very aggressively. Got it?

318
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,040
Got it!

319
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,600
Let's go!

320
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,440
Who's hurt?

321
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,640
It's all cow.

322
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,000
Yeah, it's all cow.

323
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,640
Y'all see that cow's head shoot up?

324
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,040
Just like a cartoon.
It's fucking crazy.

325
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,960
You said this area was swept for mines.

326
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,400
Wasn't a mine. It was a cluster bomb.
They're hard to see.

327
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,600
Get in the Humvee.
We're moving on.

328
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,120
Round, round, get around
I get around

329
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,000
Yeah, get around
I get around

330
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,560
We go in fast, leave the safeties on.

331
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,360
Hit them with the blinding power
of American sunshine.

332
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,600
Where's the bunker?

333
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,720
There. No, there!

334
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,000
Orders from the President
of the United States of America!

335
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,920
Orders from the President
of the United States of America!

336
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,520
Stay back!

337
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,240
On the ground, right now!

338
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,560
We are the Army
of the United States of America!

339
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,080
Stay back!

340
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:32,000
No milk! Baby milk!

341
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,280
Baby milk!

342
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,080
Let's go!

343
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,520
Let's go! Step aside! Move!

344
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,480
Orders from President Bush!
Part of the cease-fire agreement.

345
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,840
Clear. Let's move!

346
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,280
United States military!

347
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,640
We are here for your protection
and safety, all right?

348
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,720
Get down on the ground!
Get down on the ground!

349
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,120
Order from the United States.

350
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,040
Shit!

351
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,040
Again!

352
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,760
- Freeze!
- I love the United State of freedom.

353
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,760
I am hate Saddam.

354
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,280
Let him go!

355
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,680
No problem, my friend.

356
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:50,960
No problem.

357
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,040
Tell him to shut up. Be quiet.

358
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,080
I am love United State of freedom.

359
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,400
I'm love United States of freedom too.

360
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,560
- Just calm down and be quiet, okay?
- I am friend!

361
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,040
I am friend.

362
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,640
You look for chemical weapon?

363
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,040
- We look for the gold.
- No gold here.

364
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,440
No gold.

365
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,200
- What did he say?
- No gold, my friend.

366
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,680
He says there's no gold here!

367
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,520
Where's the gold?

368
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,920
- IKill him.
- You want to die?!

369
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,520
- Other bunker, other village!
- Other bunker?

370
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,840
- Not this bunker?
- No. Not this town.

371
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,320
That town?

372
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,800
That town! Yes! That town.

373
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,600
Let's go.

374
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,600
It's milk.

375
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,800
Please bring medicine!

376
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,840
Please help us.

377
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,040
Come on!

378
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,080
Off the vehicle!

379
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,280
Ma'am, you'll have to step down
from the vehicle!

380
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,680
Hospital!

381
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,840
Food. Food.

382
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,040
Give them the M.R.E.s! Let's go!

383
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,760
Take that. Take that.

384
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,480
He's taking the water
away from that woman!

385
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,960
Heads up!

386
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,520
Here you go.

387
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,280
Look out! Get off!

388
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,280
Give that back to the boy!

389
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,800
Take me, take me!

390
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,960
You can't come with us!

391
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,680
Right here, right now.

392
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,240
What was going on back there, major?

393
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,600
Civilians spitting on soldiers,
soldiers shooting civilians.

394
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,440
They ignored us like we weren't there.

395
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,960
They surrendered to us.
They're after civilians now.

396
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,800
Why'd they blow up that milk truck?

397
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,480
Trying to starve the people out.

398
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,760
Why?

399
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,760
Bush told the people to rise up
against Saddam.

400
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,880
They thought they had our support.

401
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,280
Now they're getting slaughtered.

402
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,320
So where's the next bunker?

403
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,800
About 20 clicks on the map,
according to what that guy said.

404
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,480
No, it's not.

405
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,040
There's something about that well.

406
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,960
- What well?
- The well in the center of town.

407
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,920
There were soldiers guarding it.
I bet there's a bunker in there.

408
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,920
Guy lied to us.

409
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,560
It's back where we came from.

410
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,320
I don't know if I can do this, okay?

411
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,640
I got a family.

412
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,360
If I'm gonna shit in a bag for life
'cause I got shot after the war...

413
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,760
...that'd be pretty stupid,
wouldn't it?

414
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,440
What's the most important thing in life?

415
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,400
What are you talking about?

416
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,080
What's the most important thing?

417
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,800
- Respect.
- Too dependent on other people.

418
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,480
- What, love?
- A little Disneyland, isn't it?

419
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,360
God's will.

420
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,640
Close.

421
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,200
What is it, then?

422
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,640
Necessity.

423
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:33,120
As in...?

424
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:37,000
People do what is most necessary
to them at any given moment.

425
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,120
Now, what is most necessary to Saddam's
troops is to put down the uprising.

426
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,240
We can do what we want.
They won't touch us.

427
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,600
All right. I'll be wearing
fashionable IKevlar.

428
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,600
Me too.

429
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,440
Come on, Conrad.

430
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,600
Where the hell are the bunkers?

431
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,000
Supposed to be right around here.

432
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,000
How about these fires?

433
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,160
I already did this story, goddamn it!

434
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,040
How about a rare pelican migration
out by the marshes?

435
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,440
Fuck that! Stop the car!

436
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,720
I don't see any bunkers. Do you?

437
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,400
We'll find Major Gates, ma'am.

438
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,400
Bullshit. All we're finding is
Ukrainian cranes.

439
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,000
Pelicans.

440
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,320
This story has been so done.
A waste of my fucking time.

441
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,520
Look at these poor fucking birds.

442
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:30,560
All covered in some kind of fucking oil,
ecological catastrophic...

443
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,160
Fuck it!

444
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,560
It's so goddamn horrible!

445
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,240
Jesus Christ!

446
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,240
Poor fucking birds!

447
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,640
Look at them.

448
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,320
It's so sad.

449
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,360
You're not gonna fuck me.

450
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,400
I was promised the gold story,
and I'm driving.

451
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,400
Military regulations. You cannot drive!

452
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,560
Step away from the Chenowth, ma'am!

453
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,880
Don't make me shoot you, ma'am!

454
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,720
Please fucking stop!

455
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,000
Will you tell me where he is?

456
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,320
- I can't tell you!
- Bullshit!

457
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,320
- Where is he?
- I can't-!

458
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,040
Come on, bitch! Tell me where he is!

459
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,080
You'll die here
like these fucking birds!

460
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:47,040
It's a village near IKarbala!

461
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,160
All right! Let's go to IKarbala.

462
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,320
Get down!

463
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,040
Get down!

464
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,520
Get down!

465
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:27,400
Don't make me smoke your ass, Abdul.
We'll have no nonsense this time.

466
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,400
You fucking liar!

467
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,320
Freeze!

468
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,480
By orders of the cease-fire
signed in Safwan, March 3rd...

469
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,560
...the United States military
hereby confiscates...

470
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:52,040
...all materials stolen by Iraq
from the state of IKuwait.

471
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,400
That means everything you took
is going back!

472
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,440
Stay calm and
we'll get through this quickly.

473
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,000
Is that clear? Good!

474
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,880
Grab him!

475
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,680
IKeep your finger off the trigger!

476
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,840
Sorry about that, sir.

477
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,880
No.

478
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,480
For wife!

479
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,720
I'm divorced.

480
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,000
Newest and best.

481
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,320
Newest and best has better
noise reduction.

482
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,080
Less distortion. Get on the ground.

483
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,640
This is bad music. This is bad for you.

484
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,480
I want you to tell me where the gold is.

485
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,360
There's another door over here.

486
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,000
He is prisoner. It's okay.

487
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,960
These rebel Iraq problem!

488
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,680
We take outside
so they don't bother you.

489
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,840
You open that door now.

490
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,920
Open that door!

491
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,200
Let's go!

492
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,760
Get down on the ground!

493
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,000
The prisoner stay!

494
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,640
Get on the ground!

495
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
The prisoners must stay!

496
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:53,000
Listen to me. Everything you stole from
IKuwait belongs to us now. Understand?

497
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,240
Put it back.

498
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,240
Why?

499
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:01,280
We stick to the plan for the gold.
We're not thieves.

500
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,960
We're returning IKuwaiti bullion,
correct?

501
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,720
Full.

502
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,480
Full.

503
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,640
I'm getting a fleet of Lexus
convertibles.

504
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:00,320
I told you Lexus don't make
a convertible.

505
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,920
I'll bet you a Lexus they do.

506
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,080
You're on, but it won't be a
convertible. I guarantee you.

507
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,200
You all right?

508
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,600
It landed on my foot.

509
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,520
They definitely didn't
get here in these bags.

510
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,360
The tensilary strength in these
is only 200 pounds.

511
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,200
- What?
- Tensilary strength.

512
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,960
He works at an airport.

513
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,200
If we put it in one of these
Vuitton bags...

514
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,880
...they can hold about 65 pounds,
maybe more.

515
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,840
You have any more luggage?

516
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,080
United States military
is in charge here.

517
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,440
I saw a truck out by the gas station.

518
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,400
What gas station?

519
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,800
The one upstairs.

520
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,200
Let's see what U-Haul has on the lot.

521
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,600
We need a truck.

522
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,160
Did we get it?

523
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,200
Did we get it?

524
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,320
- We got it.
- Is it a lot?

525
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,600
You have no idea. Are you cool here?

526
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,360
They've been ignoring me.

527
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,360
Don't worry about it. Stay calm.
I'm going to find a truck.

528
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,920
Move!

529
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,080
Move away from the vehicle!

530
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,200
Let's go!

531
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,440
You take the IKuwaiti gold, yes?

532
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,000
We take the IKuwaiti gold, yes.

533
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,120
- Saddam cannot keep?
- No, Saddam cannot keep.

534
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,960
Saddam have many problem today.

535
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,600
He certainly does.

536
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,200
You need help to carry?

537
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,560
I think we'll be all right.

538
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,320
These man help you.

539
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,760
These man help you.

540
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,520
And then you go away fast
from all this bullshit.

541
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,840
IKeep it going, keep it going.

542
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:23,880
Don't leave. Please don't leave.

543
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,920
Don't leave!

544
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,200
Look!

545
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,720
Help!

546
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,520
Look!

547
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,680
Look!

548
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,240
Help!

549
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,720
Please!

550
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,880
Don't go. Don't go.

551
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,960
You go now, please.

552
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,680
I don't think so.

553
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,880
This man is leader of uprising.

554
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:28,120
Let's just stick to the plan!
The plan is for the gold!

555
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,240
We can help these people,
then we'll be on our way.

556
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,960
That's not why we're here!
Let's go!

557
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,240
Cover me.

558
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:58,480
No unnecessary shots, Conrad,
because we know what they do.

559
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,920
They make infected pockets
full of bile, sir.

560
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,800
That's right. That's what they do.

561
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,880
I want you to leave this town.

562
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,320
Saddam kill us if we leave.
IKill our family!

563
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,480
We give you the gold.
Now U.S.A. out of Iraq.

564
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,240
No shooting.

565
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,680
Okay, we work something out.

566
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,200
Easy! Take it easy!

567
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:13,880
What's happening?

568
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,280
Accident. Stay cool.

569
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,680
Put your hands up.

570
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,920
I'm okay.

571
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,520
Get down!

572
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,320
Shut up! Get down!

573
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,600
Get down! Shut up.

574
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,360
- Put the people in the Humvee.
- What?!

575
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,600
Put the people in the Humvee!

576
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,040
- There's no room!
- Make room!

577
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,040
What happened to necessity?

578
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,920
It just changed!

579
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,040
Not for me! Let's go!

580
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,200
What if that was you?!

581
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,200
What if this was you without IKevlar?!

582
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,480
Great. A fucking tank!

583
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,280
That should send us on our way!

584
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,040
L.A.W., sir?

585
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:24,560
Let's get the hell out of here.

586
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,320
It's about fucking time!

587
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,160
Ride in that Humvee. Let's go!
In the Humvee!

588
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,440
Come on, sweetheart, come on.

589
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:39,680
Hurry up!

590
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,560
Let's go!

591
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:06,480
Stupid son of a bitch!
We were home free!

592
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,560
Give me that arm.

593
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:14,000
What's that tank doing?

594
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,520
I don't know. Looks like it stopped.

595
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,080
They broke the cease-fire.

596
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,360
You better do something.

597
00:45:58,920 --> 00:45:59,920
Mortar!

598
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,400
It's gas!

599
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,320
Where's my mask?

600
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,840
Where's my fucking mask?

601
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:31,840
Where's my mask?!

602
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:33,960
Mine!

603
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,160
Stop! Stop!

604
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,520
Wait! Those are mines!

605
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,120
Come back this way.

606
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,040
Stop!

607
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:39,320
No, this isn't sarin.
We'd be dead already!

608
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,800
- What is it? Mustard?
- C.S.

609
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,480
Tear gas?

610
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,880
Times 10.

611
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,760
Come here.

612
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:53,120
Put this on.

613
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:55,760
Here, you take it.

614
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,240
See that? That's a mine!

615
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,600
Don't step there! Do not step there!

616
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,520
Where's your kids?

617
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,680
Cover your face. Come here.

618
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,600
Where are your children?

619
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,040
What happened to your children?

620
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,760
Watch your back!

621
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:20,640
Freeze! Don't move!

622
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:23,280
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

623
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:31,960
It's okay. They're helping us.
They're with the rebels.

624
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,000
They got a shelter.

625
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:36,840
Tunnel.

626
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,160
Go, go. Get in!

627
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,880
I gotta look for Barlow.

628
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:47,040
Where's Troy?

629
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:49,720
Wait a minute! Where's Troy?

630
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,400
We gotta get out of here.

631
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:53,960
Where is Troy?

632
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,840
- Come on!
- Get off me!

633
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,400
Let's go!

634
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,400
You motherfucker! Get the fuck off me!

635
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,560
Get the fuck off me!

636
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,720
We have to go back and get Troy.

637
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,160
He's not out there.
We have to wait till it clears.

638
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,800
You made a choice in the village,
and we lost Troy.

639
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,960
- I had no choice.
- You had a choice!

640
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,400
I had no choice.

641
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,440
What about Troy?
What choice does he have now?

642
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,240
Paco, start shooting!

643
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,920
I don't like this.

644
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:23,760
We should go!

645
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,400
Let me handle this.

646
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,640
Get dressed!

647
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:43,760
Get dressed!

648
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:44,960
I said okay!

649
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,520
Fuck!

650
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,960
Do you speak English?

651
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,200
Could you...?

652
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,760
I have a little problem.

653
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,200
I need to know the number.
What number, please?

654
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,160
Operation Desert Storm.

655
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:31,080
I'm sorry. I need to know the number.

656
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,640
The big army in the desert.
It's an emergency!

657
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,680
You'll have to give me more-

658
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,360
Fuck! Maybe-

659
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,720
Come on, come on, come on!

660
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:57,880
Honey, it's me.

661
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,040
Oh, my God! Baby, I was
hoping it was you!

662
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,160
It's me, honey.

663
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,240
God, the baby's crying.

664
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,400
How's she doing?

665
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:12,000
She hasn't slept good, and Mom had
to go back to work, so I'm real tired.

666
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:15,960
- I wish I was there to help, gooney bird.
- When are you coming home?

667
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,200
I'm working on that right now.

668
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,480
I saw an ad for a computer job.
You want me to set up an interview?

669
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,920
- Listen, honey-
- What date are you coming home?

670
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:26,160
We don't have
an exact date yet, but-

671
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:28,280
If I knew,
I could set up this interview-

672
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,560
- Listen to me!
- What's happening?

673
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,000
- What was that?
- The wall just exploded.

674
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,400
I thought the war was over.

675
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:38,200
It is and it isn't.
Could you call the reserve center?

676
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,560
What do you want me to do?

677
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:44,120
Tell the duty NCO I'm stuck in a bunker
near 223 north, outside IKarbala.

678
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,640
223 north, outside IKarbala.

679
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:49,920
- Everything's okay?
- I don't want you to worry.

680
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,760
I tried to do something
for the family, and...

681
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,120
I just want you to know-

682
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:55,360
IKnow what?

683
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,040
- I love you.
- What's going on?

684
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:58,200
Just tell IKrystal.

685
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,560
Tell her I'm rich, and if things
work out, she'll be taken care of.

686
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:04,880
What are you saying?

687
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,560
I gotta go, gooney bird!
I love you!

688
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,000
Spirits are high,
and music is soaring...

689
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:26,760
...as these young troops celebrate
the liberation of IKuwait.

690
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,920
The mood here is boisterous and giddy,
as these troops are-

691
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:34,080
I'm being held by a bunker outside-
Shit! Wait!

692
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:38,840
I'm being held captive by Iraqi troops
outside a bunker near the gritty city-

693
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,000
Wait. Cut, cut!

694
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,320
You said "gritty city" again.

695
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:45,720
Who gives a shit?! These people
are dying, for chrissake!

696
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,760
What about Private Wogoman?

697
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,880
Let's lay one down first.

698
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,080
In three, two...

699
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,240
I'm being held captive
by Iraqi troops...

700
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:56,360
...outside a bunker far from IKarbala.

701
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,960
The rebels have gone down the road...

702
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:11,160
The assault, apparently started by the
rebels from IKarbala, came up on-

703
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,600
Back off!

704
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:14,560
Sir, that's enough!

705
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,400
We have a right to be here!

706
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,600
That's mine.

707
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:20,520
Fuck it.

708
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,480
Could I have my pants, please?

709
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,360
My pants! On my legs!

710
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:26,640
Go!

711
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:30,960
Out! Get out!

712
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:34,960
What did you want to be as a little boy?

713
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:39,160
As a boy, I wanted to be either a
veterinarian or a CIA sharpshooter.

714
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,720
Really? That's very complicated.

715
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,320
Yes, colonel.

716
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,160
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I'm giving an interview to NRG.

717
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:50,240
- Do you have authorization?
- Yes, sir, I do.

718
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:56,840
No.

719
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,200
- Who gave you this?
- Major Gates.

720
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:04,120
Archie Gates gave you this?
Jesus Christ, Doug!

721
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,840
- I don't get to do the interview?
- You don't get to do the interview.

722
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,360
Come with me.

723
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:14,480
Tell me where he is, or you're going
back to the hotel in Dhahran.

724
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,200
I don't know. I think he's
helping Adriana Cruz.

725
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,800
- Is she here?
- No, sir.

726
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,320
So who else is missing?

727
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,000
- Chief's not here.
- Chief's not here?

728
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,240
You don't know where your
sergeant is?

729
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,520
Barlow and Vig are gone too, sir.

730
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:29,680
They got a document out of
a guy's ass yesterday, sir.

731
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:31,480
What?

732
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:35,520
I don't know what it was, a map or
secret list. I saw it happen.

733
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,960
- Did they bring it to you?
- No, sir.

734
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,360
See, he's working something.

735
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:44,960
Get me maps. Check radio transmissions.
Maybe we'll get their positions.

736
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:52,800
What's wrong with him?
Is he dead?

737
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,720
Is that guy dead?
Where are you gonna put him?

738
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:57,480
A shrine.

739
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,640
A shrine?
What kind of shrine y'all got?

740
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:02,400
A shrine near a holy man...

741
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:06,400
...that gives him comfort
and access to paradise.

742
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:10,840
That sounds like a pretty good shrine,
right, Chief?

743
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:15,000
I'm not kidding.
It sounds like a good shrine.

744
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,720
Man, I'm sorry I hit you.

745
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,920
I was just worried about Troy.

746
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,560
He's my friend.

747
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,800
I didn't want nothing to happen to him.

748
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:30,680
He's gonna take me to Detroit with
him, hook me up with a job.

749
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,320
Come on, man.

750
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,400
I know you was coming to help me.

751
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,000
I don't wanna hold no grudges.

752
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:51,320
You got kicked out of that
ring of Jesus fire, huh?

753
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,240
That ain't how it work.

754
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,160
How's it work?

755
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:59,760
I take care of whatever He puts
in front of me, no questions asked.

756
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,600
He put that gold in front of me,
and I took it.

757
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,800
That's how it works.

758
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:06,520
What about now?

759
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,640
I don't know. I gotta see.

760
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:14,400
How you doing, Conrad?

761
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:16,160
I'm fine.

762
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,320
It was my choice today.

763
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:25,880
You can try to head back if you want.
Take your share and bury it.

764
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:28,080
I'll find Barlow myself.

765
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:31,880
I wanna find Troy.

766
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:34,360
I'm here. I'm ready.

767
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:42,120
Let's check the suitcases.

768
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,400
I count 79.

769
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:54,280
That means we're missing 41 bags.

770
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:57,040
That's about 23 million dollars left.

771
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:02,040
Not bad for a disaster, provided we find
Barlow and not get court-martialed.

772
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,240
How is she?

773
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,160
How is your little girl?

774
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,800
She's traumatized. What do you expect?

775
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,680
I went to B-school at Bowling Green.

776
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:18,960
I came back to open a couple
of hotels near IKarbala.

777
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:21,640
I'm nearly in the black
when this stupid war starts...

778
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:24,280
...and you guys bomb all my cafs.

779
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:29,600
Now we try to get rid of Saddam, Bush
leaves us twisting in the winds.

780
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,000
Look at these people.

781
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:37,200
Where is America now?

782
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,040
Where is the Army now?!

783
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,640
You have a radio?

784
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,800
No radio, no water.

785
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:50,400
- Where's Barlow?
- They got him.

786
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,600
- Where would they take him?
- Oasis bunker.

787
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:55,760
It's full of Saddam's Guard.

788
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,640
- Where's that?
- Approximately 17, 18 miles from here.

789
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,920
- Take us there.
- We have no transportation.

790
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,480
We'll walk until we find some.

791
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,520
Why don't you call in the Marines?

792
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,160
With what? We don't have a radio.

793
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:11,800
We'll find a vehicle, you drive back,
get a helicopter, fly in, get your man.

794
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,760
- Can't do that.
- Why not? You have a huge army here.

795
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:16,880
We shouldn't be involved
in the uprising.

796
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:20,400
We killed Iraqi soldiers,
broke the peace accord.

797
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:22,080
You know what I think?

798
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:26,440
We're fighting Saddam and dying,
and you're stealing gold.

799
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:28,600
You're wrong.

800
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,680
They have half a million men here.

801
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:34,240
They send four guys
to pick up all this bullion?

802
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:36,040
I don't think so.

803
01:02:38,080 --> 01:02:41,800
We need to find our man. How much
do you want to take us to him?

804
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:44,560
Is this still yours to give?

805
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:48,160
The only reason you have these bags
is we picked them up.

806
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,040
We'll take our share...

807
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:53,920
...and we will help you
carry your share.

808
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:56,880
And find our man.

809
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:01,840
Amir Abdulah.

810
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,920
Archie Gates.

811
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:07,360
You will take us to the Iranian border.

812
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:12,120
If we don't get to a refugee camp,
we're dead. The nearest is in Iran.

813
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:14,120
You don't need us.
You can buy your way.

814
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:17,200
Saddam's soldiers
won't take Saddam's gold.

815
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:19,720
Our only chance
is if we are with Americans.

816
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,720
Can't take you to the Iranian border.

817
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:23,160
Then we don't have a deal.

818
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:24,960
Give me a fucking break, man!

819
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:26,040
We saved your life!

820
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:28,520
- And we saved yours.
- We lost a man for you.

821
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:31,640
What good is it if you leave us here
to be slaughtered?

822
01:03:32,080 --> 01:03:36,400
The big army of democracy beats the ugly
dictator and saves the rich IKuwaitis...

823
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:41,240
...but you go to jail if you help us
escape the same dictator?

824
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,480
You saw what happened to my wife.

825
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,680
Look at my daughter.

826
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:54,400
Who's going?

827
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:57,200
Everyone but the priests.
That makes 55.

828
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,600
Did we save anything from the Humvee?

829
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,080
Vig's bag.

830
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:22,720
Lovely.

831
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,160
What is your rank, bro?

832
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,160
Sergeant first class.

833
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:30,800
Your company?

834
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:34,440
437 Civil Affairs Company,
U.S. Army Reserve.

835
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:38,720
My main man...

836
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,960
...tell me something, okay?

837
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,520
What is the problem
with Michael Jackson?

838
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:48,360
What do you mean?

839
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:51,480
What is the problem
with Michael Jackson?

840
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:59,120
What is the problem
with Michael Jackson?

841
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:02,120
You understand my question?

842
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:04,920
I'm not sure I do.

843
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:06,720
The IKing of Pop.

844
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:10,520
Michael Jackson.

845
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:13,440
He come to Egypt.
I see picture in newspaper.

846
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:17,280
"Hello," with the white glove.
"I'm Michael Jackson in my hotel room...

847
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:21,920
...with my chop-up face. " Your country
make him chop up his face.

848
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,680
I don't think so.

849
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:27,160
Michael Jackson is pop king of sick
fucking country.

850
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:29,520
That's bullshit. He did it to himself.

851
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:36,520
You are the blind bullshit,
my main man.

852
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,720
It is so obvious a black man...

853
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:43,560
...make the skin white and the hair
straight, and you know why?

854
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:44,800
No.

855
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:48,840
Your sick fucking country make the black
man hate himself...

856
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:52,720
...just like you hate the Arab
and the children you bomb over here.

857
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:54,560
I don't hate children.

858
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:57,960
- This is illegal. The war is over.
- That's why you are illegal.

859
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:01,280
You broke the cease-fire, and I think
even you steal the gold.

860
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:05,040
So nobody know where you are, right?
Your Army don't know.

861
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:08,800
I'll send you to Baghdad for a long
time. Nobody found you.

862
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,920
- Do they care, buddy?
- Does who care?

863
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:19,800
Do your Army care about the children
in Iraq? Do they come back to help?

864
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:21,920
No, they're not coming.

865
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:37,560
Do your Army...

866
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:40,560
...come back to help the people?

867
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:42,960
Tell the truth, dudesky.

868
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:45,200
Save us the big bummer.

869
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,080
That's the truth.

870
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:19,360
Does it hurt?

871
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:23,560
I asked you a question, man!
Does it hurt?

872
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:25,360
Yes, it hurts.

873
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:29,040
You bomb my family. Do you know that?

874
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:34,040
You blow up my home. The whole street.

875
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:37,760
My wife is crush by big fucking
block of concrete.

876
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:40,080
She lose her legs.

877
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:42,520
Those legs cut off now.

878
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,680
- That's horrible.
- What?

879
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,200
I said that's horrible.

880
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:52,480
My God, buddy. I didn't even told you
the horrible part yet.

881
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:56,960
My son...

882
01:07:57,720 --> 01:08:00,000
My son was killed in his bed.

883
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:05,160
He is 1 years old.

884
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:08,240
He is sleeping with his toy
when the bomb come.

885
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:13,840
I have a daughter.

886
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:16,520
Very nice for you, bro.

887
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,200
She's safe in Arizona...

888
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:21,600
...without the bomb, the concrete and
all this shit.

889
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:24,080
I'm not from Arizona.

890
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:27,520
How old is she?

891
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:30,200
One month old.

892
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:32,040
What's her name?

893
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:35,760
IKrystal.

894
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:39,400
What make you decide to tell me
about IKrystal, my main man?

895
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:42,880
Because we're both fathers.

896
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:46,440
I'm not father no more, dude.
Remember?

897
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:49,200
My son is dead now.

898
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:55,480
Can you think how it feel
inside your heart...

899
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:57,720
...if I bomb your daughter?

900
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:04,160
Worse than death.

901
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,240
That's right.

902
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:09,240
Worse than death.

903
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:42,920
Y'all think America is Satan, right?
America is Satan?

904
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:48,040
What'd they say?

905
01:09:48,280 --> 01:09:50,240
They say he want salon.

906
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:53,760
- A what?
- A salon. Hair salon.

907
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:55,280
You cut hair?

908
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:56,480
Yes.

909
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:02,320
Look, they don't care if they cut
American hair, Shiite hair, Sunni hair.

910
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:07,280
They just want get rid of Saddam
and live life. Make business.

911
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,400
He wants to know,
do you want to kill every Arab?

912
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:17,000
That's what I was trained to do.

913
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:21,280
No. That was not our training.
We got Arab allies, man.

914
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,840
Yeah, well, we got Arab allies.

915
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:28,880
He says, "So you don't want to kill
every Arab. "

916
01:10:29,680 --> 01:10:32,480
He's just had no high school.
No high school.

917
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:34,480
Don't tell people that.

918
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:43,360
- What'd they say?
- He says you have terrible haircut.

919
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:47,720
Troy gave me this haircut.
It's a badass haircut.

920
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:54,880
America!

921
01:10:55,720 --> 01:10:57,120
America!

922
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,680
America, welcome!

923
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:49,640
- How you doing?
- "How are you?"

924
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,720
He's happy to welcome America.

925
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:53,760
- Thank you.
- We welcome America!

926
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:57,480
They're all deserters.
They leave Saddam army.

927
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,240
But they help us near IKarbala.
Good man.

928
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:10,680
No, my friend! The man don't do that.
Only the woman.

929
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:14,080
Why's that?

930
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:16,080
Because it's their custom.

931
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:18,440
- You have a radio?
- No radio.

932
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,920
George Bush get rid Saddams now?

933
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:22,440
Not exactly, no.

934
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:23,720
Congratulation!

935
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:25,200
Congratulation!

936
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:28,960
Would you inform this gentleman
we need a vehicle of some kind?

937
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:50,120
From IKuwait.

938
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,280
Let me ask you a question.

939
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:12,560
Does Lexus make this model?

940
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:14,480
Infiniti convertible only.

941
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:16,840
No Lexus convertible. Infiniti only.

942
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,320
Infiniti only.

943
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:20,080
Exactly what I said.

944
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:24,080
We use these cars
to fight Saddam's soldiers.

945
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:27,280
What's so funny?

946
01:13:28,040 --> 01:13:29,200
Cannot take.

947
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:33,280
What do you mean? We kicked
Saddam's ass. We definitely take.

948
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:35,280
We are the United States Army.

949
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:38,560
You are three guys with a bunch of
civilians and no Humvee.

950
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:42,120
Need money. Have no money.
To eat, to live.

951
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:48,480
"American Army is huge, with planes
and tanks. We have nothing. "

952
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:52,240
Listen to me.
We will rise up together. Tell him.

953
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:53,520
Rise up.

954
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,520
Look at us. Many races.

955
01:13:57,160 --> 01:14:00,240
Many nations, many nations.
Working together.

956
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,160
- Tell him, Chief.
- We're united.

957
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:03,520
United.

958
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:06,840
George Bush. George Bush wants you.

959
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,840
Stand up for yourself.

960
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,000
Wants you!

961
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:16,280
He wants everybody.

962
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:18,800
Yes! Me and you stand up together!

963
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:21,360
We fight. IKick Saddam's ass!

964
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,640
George Bush wants you!

965
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:37,440
Make the fight for freedom on your own!
Then America will follow!

966
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:38,600
Praise the Lord!

967
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,640
God bless America,
and God bless a free Iraq!

968
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:51,120
Free Iraq!

969
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:56,480
Free Iraq!

970
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:58,400
Now, what do you say, my friend?

971
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:00,080
Cannot give car.

972
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:03,320
I guess we'll buy them.

973
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:17,280
Come on, man. This is good music.
Judas Priest will pump you up!

974
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:20,480
No! We're not listening to that
headache music.

975
01:15:20,720 --> 01:15:21,840
Just one song.

976
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:25,320
What you need is that
easy-listening classics.

977
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,120
I do not need that.

978
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:29,040
You need something to calm you.

979
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:31,280
Not easy-listening classics.

980
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:33,520
All right, try this.

981
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:46,920
This is from Barlow's wife in Detroit.
They may have a position on him.

982
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:49,280
From his wife in Detroit?

983
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:51,920
What the hell is this?

984
01:15:52,720 --> 01:15:56,680
The war's over and I don't know
what it was about. What was it about?

985
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:59,440
- I was managed by the military.
- Me too.

986
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,440
I try to be substance-based,
not style-based.

987
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:03,920
I think you got style.

988
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:06,080
That little Cathy bitch
says I'm old.

989
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:07,920
That's because she's jealous.

990
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:11,400
First of all, you're smarter than her,
and that is a threat.

991
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:14,400
And second of all, you are beautiful.

992
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:18,440
You're the most prettiest woman down
there at that network.

993
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:22,280
You got great skin. Beautiful hair.

994
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:26,320
That's sweet, but there's
sexual politics in this business.

995
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:30,000
It's about looks. It's about sex.
It's about style.

996
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:32,720
Many anchormen came on to me,
and I didn't go for it.

997
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:36,080
I never played that game or dropped
to my knees for an assignment.

998
01:16:36,440 --> 01:16:40,360
I came out to the desert because
nobody else had the balls to do it.

999
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:48,880
I only joined Saddam Hussein army
to make good living for my family.

1000
01:16:49,160 --> 01:16:50,640
Good house.

1001
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:53,320
Now I can't get out.

1002
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:56,800
I joined up for the extra cash too.

1003
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,280
Found out I was gonna have a baby.

1004
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:03,600
You know, I got weapon and training
from America.

1005
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:05,200
Bullshit.

1006
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:07,600
How you think I learned my English?

1007
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:09,360
Specialist guys come here...

1008
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:11,920
...to train us when we fight Iran.

1009
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:13,840
What'd they train you in?

1010
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,080
Weapons, sabotage...

1011
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:17,520
...interrogation.

1012
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:19,520
Great.

1013
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:24,080
It was a total waste for your Army
to come to Iraq, right?

1014
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:27,600
I heard about a lot of bad shit that
happened in IKuwait.

1015
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:30,800
Bad shit happened.
I'm not proud of that.

1016
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:32,560
Who's got the sick country?

1017
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:34,640
Maybe Saddam is very crazy.

1018
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:37,200
And then you are crazy to bomb
all of Iraq.

1019
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:41,000
Too much bombing is crazy,
but not saving IKuwait.

1020
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:44,040
You are here for save IKuwaiti people?

1021
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:45,600
Really?

1022
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:52,880
Lot of people in trouble
in this world...

1023
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:55,280
...and you don't fight no war for them.

1024
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,280
You can't invade another country.

1025
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:59,080
Why not, dude?

1026
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,000
It makes the world crazy.
You need to keep it stable.

1027
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:04,320
For what? Your pickup truck?

1028
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:08,000
No, for stability.
Stabilize the region.

1029
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:26,640
This is your fucking stability,
my main man.

1030
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:41,920
We get our man, then we come back
and pick up the gold.

1031
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:43,760
- And my people?
- That's right.

1032
01:18:45,640 --> 01:18:47,120
Let's go over the plan.

1033
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:49,680
Let's do it.

1034
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:54,800
There's a bunker built into the side
of the cliff face.

1035
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:58,480
Looks like a castle. There's a road
coming there, another one across.

1036
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:03,200
It's full of Saddam's Republican Guard.
I don't think we can overpower them.

1037
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:04,640
There's too many.

1038
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:06,760
But there's one thing they're afraid of.

1039
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:08,240
What's that?

1040
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:09,680
Saddam.

1041
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:12,720
Then that's what we use.

1042
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,280
Right. That's what we'll use.

1043
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:17,480
You stay with me.

1044
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:21,160
You stay with me.

1045
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:32,480
Hold on. I wanna go over
this plan one more time.

1046
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:34,280
You're scared, right?

1047
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,000
Maybe.

1048
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:39,840
The way this works is, you do the thing
you're scared shitless of...

1049
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:43,680
...and you get the courage after
you do it. Not before you do it.

1050
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:48,400
That's a dumb-ass way to work.
It should be the other way around.

1051
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:49,840
I know.

1052
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:52,360
That's the way it works.

1053
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:11,560
I got a splinter.

1054
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:50,320
Jesus fire, Jesus fire, Jesus fire...

1055
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:42,800
Come on.

1056
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:44,840
Quickly.

1057
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:03,920
Oh, shit!

1058
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:31,280
You all right?

1059
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:33,360
Shit, you're dead.

1060
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:58,960
Wait! Wait!

1061
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,440
Shit.

1062
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,880
Come on. Amir, come on.

1063
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:26,280
Let's get out of here.

1064
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:04,640
Where's Conrad?

1065
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:12,560
IKeep your guard up.

1066
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:31,040
Are you okay?

1067
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:34,120
Where's Conrad?
How are we getting back?

1068
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:36,880
- We got the Rolls.
- You got a Rolls?

1069
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:43,120
This is an Infiniti convertible.

1070
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:46,800
Man, I think you're in shock.

1071
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:51,280
It's an Infiniti convertible, isn't it?

1072
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:52,520
Yeah, it is.

1073
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:55,120
Okay, so I owe you a car.
I'm not in shock.

1074
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:56,720
Sure you're okay?

1075
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:58,400
Freeze!

1076
01:29:59,680 --> 01:30:01,200
No! He's with us!

1077
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:03,120
Don't shoot him! He's with us!

1078
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:06,640
- You're the guy with the little girl.
- That's right.

1079
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:08,560
What are you doing here?

1080
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:11,520
- He helped us find you.
- I came here to help you.

1081
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:14,880
All right. You're all right, man!

1082
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:19,880
I see some people.

1083
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:22,000
I can't see what's happening. Stay put.

1084
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:24,560
- How's your little girl?
- She's safe for now.

1085
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:27,280
Outstanding! Excellent!
How can we help you?

1086
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:31,560
We had a deal to get to the border, but
we have more people and need vehicles.

1087
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:33,680
That's not a problem.
We'll work it out.

1088
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:35,760
We have to do this. We can work it out.

1089
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,000
I don't know. It's a lot of people.

1090
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:42,120
You choose who we take. Tell the
others they'll have to die.

1091
01:30:42,320 --> 01:30:45,520
I can't do that.
You'll have to do that yourself.

1092
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:56,400
You made it, man!

1093
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:58,320
I thought that was you!

1094
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:00,720
Where the fuck have you been?

1095
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:21,960
What are you wearing?

1096
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:23,360
What is this?

1097
01:31:23,600 --> 01:31:26,320
It's a suit jacket.
The Iraqis gave it to me.

1098
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:27,840
I didn't recognize you in it.

1099
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:29,640
It fits all right, right?

1100
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,040
Chief! We need your help!

1101
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:33,920
I'm okay.

1102
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:35,840
Where's he hit?

1103
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:38,880
It's in and out. I think
it's above his collarbone.

1104
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:41,680
Where's the Jesus fire?

1105
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:44,680
It's all around you right now.
You'll be all right.

1106
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:46,080
You'll be all right.

1107
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:47,760
I'm going to hell.

1108
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:49,680
You're gonna be fine.

1109
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:54,080
Can you take me to a shrine that gives
you comfort and erases your bad deeds?

1110
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:56,880
We made the right choice today.

1111
01:31:57,040 --> 01:31:59,560
Stop with that shrine shit.
It'll be okay.

1112
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:01,760
- You think so?
- I know so!

1113
01:32:01,960 --> 01:32:04,240
We're getting out of here.
Hey, major!

1114
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,000
Would you please fucking help-!

1115
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:09,320
Goddamn it!

1116
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:31,680
What's the matter, man?

1117
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:33,520
Can you breathe?

1118
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:36,520
Can you breathe?

1119
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:11,040
There's air in his chest.
It's crushing his lung.

1120
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:55,920
Does that feel better, man?

1121
01:33:56,360 --> 01:33:57,680
That feel better?

1122
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:08,320
He's gone.

1123
01:34:11,560 --> 01:34:14,240
Air pressure's going to build up about
every 15 minutes.

1124
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:16,200
Release the valve and close it back up.

1125
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:20,080
- How long can I keep doing that?
- I don't know.

1126
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:24,160
Maybe 4 or 5 hours, if you're not
bleeding too bad. You don't seem to be.

1127
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:11,600
He said he wanted
to go to one of those shrines.

1128
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:13,640
Did he mean that?

1129
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:16,080
That's what he told me.

1130
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:19,920
IKerman, Iran. We can take him with us.

1131
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:22,320
Then take him.

1132
01:35:24,400 --> 01:35:26,960
All right. Take him there.

1133
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:10,320
We found a radio inside.
You're hooked for that call, major.

1134
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:23,720
Bolo, this is Brer Rabbit.

1135
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:25,840
We're going to jail.

1136
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:29,960
No, we're not.
Bolo, this is Brer Rabbit.

1137
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:31,440
This is Bolo. Come in.

1138
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:32,880
Where are you?

1139
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:35,400
About two clicks outside of camp.

1140
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:37,280
We're ready for that briar patch.

1141
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:41,800
- I want to find out where we're going.
- Please! I'm transmitting code!

1142
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,120
You got me, Bolo?

1143
01:36:43,280 --> 01:36:44,840
I think so.

1144
01:36:45,320 --> 01:36:47,360
Who handles the briar patch?

1145
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:49,520
You do.

1146
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:53,160
Tar Baby goes to the briar patch
if everything's okay.

1147
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:55,600
No. It's the other way around.

1148
01:36:56,040 --> 01:36:58,960
Sorry, sir. I don't
remember how the code goes.

1149
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:02,560
I need four personnel trucks
and a Humvee.

1150
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:05,840
That's a pretty tall order
for a secret operation, sir.

1151
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:10,320
Talk to my friend Teebaux.
Each driver will get a hundred IK.

1152
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:12,240
Brer Rabbit at 239 north.

1153
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:16,320
Add one Medevac pack to the order.
Make sure you bring the reporter.

1154
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:18,480
Roger. Give me two hours.

1155
01:38:04,720 --> 01:38:06,480
Bury those real good, Chief.

1156
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:11,920
After we take them to the border,
we figure out a way to get it out.

1157
01:38:12,080 --> 01:38:15,760
223 north is the position his wife gave.
There's just an empty bunker there.

1158
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:18,400
Task air recon to cover
223 north to the border.

1159
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:20,080
I'll put choppers on standby.

1160
01:38:20,320 --> 01:38:22,640
If they're there, they won't be
hard to find.

1161
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:24,200
All the way, sir.

1162
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:54,560
Are you all right?

1163
01:38:54,760 --> 01:38:57,360
It's not me.
Barlow could use some morphine.

1164
01:38:57,520 --> 01:38:59,720
They got him.
Let's see about you.

1165
01:39:13,680 --> 01:39:16,480
- Did you get the gold?
- No, but we helped a lot of people.

1166
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:19,120
Now we have to get them
over the border.

1167
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:24,240
- They'll be killed without protection.
- They're gonna bust you for that.

1168
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:26,440
Cover it and see what happens.

1169
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:42,400
Sure you're not coming with us?

1170
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:44,640
I will stay here to fight Saddam.

1171
01:39:47,240 --> 01:39:48,240
Good luck.

1172
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:57,040
Sit down.
We're gonna pull out fast.

1173
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:59,040
Everybody sit down.
We're going.

1174
01:39:59,280 --> 01:40:00,680
Walter, did you meet everybody?

1175
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:02,760
Walter, this is IKaied.

1176
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:17,280
What are you thinking?

1177
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:24,680
We walk them past the Iraqi soldiers.
Make sure they're safe.

1178
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:27,360
We walk back to the trucks
and get out of here.

1179
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:29,640
All right, let's do it!

1180
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:37,320
No guns. Only American soldiers
carry guns.

1181
01:41:42,720 --> 01:41:44,880
We are just now about...

1182
01:41:45,120 --> 01:41:49,680
We're getting it now? We're about 25
yards from an Iraqi checkpoint...

1183
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:51,880
...heading into Iran.

1184
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:56,880
We are just about to move across the
zone up into the Iranian border.

1185
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:59,120
It's a barbed-wire point.

1186
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:02,800
We have men, women and children here...

1187
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:06,920
...assumed to be Iraqi refugees
crossing over into Iran.

1188
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:09,920
- Make sure they take care of Conrad.
- I will.

1189
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:17,960
We did see a lot of Iraqi soldiers.
They are here, up in bunkers.

1190
01:42:18,160 --> 01:42:19,880
IKeep in a tight group.

1191
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:24,520
We're going through some kind
of checkpoint.

1192
01:42:24,720 --> 01:42:27,120
This is a violation of American policy.

1193
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:30,160
The United States has
withdrawn its support.

1194
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:36,960
Let's cut and go again.

1195
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:05,600
You are AWOL, and you are in violation
of American policy.

1196
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:06,960
You are under arrest.

1197
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:09,160
Double-time! Let's go!

1198
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:11,840
We can make it before they stop us!

1199
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:24,240
Arrest them! Get them away
from those refugees!

1200
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:28,240
Let's go!

1201
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:32,200
Come here.

1202
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:34,440
Give me your hand! Come on!

1203
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:36,240
Watch out!

1204
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:37,440
You're under arrest!

1205
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:39,720
Let me help these people get across!

1206
01:43:43,240 --> 01:43:44,520
Go!

1207
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:46,280
Let me get her over!

1208
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:48,560
Let me get her over!

1209
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:52,320
Wait! Just let them get over first!
Wait!

1210
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:55,280
I need to reach this valve in my chest.

1211
01:43:56,960 --> 01:43:59,280
Look what's happening!
Just let them get over!

1212
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:02,280
- Help these people get across!
- You cannot support them!

1213
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:04,960
Let me get them across,
and I'll go right with you!

1214
01:44:05,200 --> 01:44:07,080
Let's go! You're coming with me!

1215
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:13,800
They'll be slaughtered
if we don't help them!

1216
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,320
Why you doing this?
They'll kill them!

1217
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:21,000
The refugees are not crossing the border.
They have been rounded up...

1218
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:26,000
Let them get over!

1219
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:28,400
That's not our mission!
You don't belong here!

1220
01:44:28,640 --> 01:44:30,640
What's the matter?
You ought to know better!

1221
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:33,680
We're not involved in this problem!
Understand?

1222
01:44:33,960 --> 01:44:35,840
You're AWOL and you're under arrest!

1223
01:44:36,040 --> 01:44:39,280
Will you let them kill those people?
It's not right!

1224
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:46,400
They're arresting them!

1225
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:47,600
I can't breathe!

1226
01:44:47,840 --> 01:44:50,960
You fucked me, now you're fucked!
So shut your mouth!

1227
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:54,240
I need to reach this!

1228
01:44:54,440 --> 01:44:55,760
Give this man medical attention!

1229
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,320
We're not involved in this problem here!

1230
01:44:58,640 --> 01:45:00,000
You're way out of line!

1231
01:45:00,240 --> 01:45:01,680
Look at him!

1232
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:04,560
- I can't reach the valve!
- He can't breathe!

1233
01:45:04,720 --> 01:45:06,080
Put the cuffs on the front!

1234
01:45:06,280 --> 01:45:07,280
He'll die if you don't-

1235
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:10,320
You don't worry about him!
Worry about yourself!

1236
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:17,440
What the hell is this?
Turn that camera off!

1237
01:45:17,680 --> 01:45:20,240
- That's a $ 70,000 camera!
- What are you doing here?!

1238
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:21,520
I'm authorized-

1239
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:25,200
He's gonna die!

1240
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:30,320
Cut his cuffs!

1241
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:33,480
- I should get this story!
- You're out of the pool! You're done!

1242
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:58,960
All we had to do was help them!
It was less than 100 feet!

1243
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:23,440
We got the gold.

1244
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:26,080
What?

1245
01:46:26,760 --> 01:46:29,920
- The Kuwaiti bullion. We've got it.
- Bullshit.

1246
01:46:32,040 --> 01:46:33,600
Hold that bag. Give me that bag!

1247
01:46:33,800 --> 01:46:34,720
Get the bag.

1248
01:46:49,160 --> 01:46:51,560
- How much do you have?
- Twenty-three million.

1249
01:46:51,760 --> 01:46:53,040
Where's it at?

1250
01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:54,880
Get those people over first.

1251
01:46:55,120 --> 01:46:56,960
They helped us find it, Ron.

1252
01:46:57,440 --> 01:47:02,160
We made a deal. It's a soldier's honor.
You can't fuck them now.

1253
01:47:04,640 --> 01:47:06,880
Come on. Return the gold.

1254
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:10,640
Save some refugees. Get that star.

1255
01:47:14,640 --> 01:47:16,080
Let's go, Doug.

1256
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:27,440
Who's in charge here?

1257
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:57,040
You're under arrest.
You'll be court-martialed...

1258
01:47:57,280 --> 01:47:59,760
...and you'll show us
where that bullion is.
