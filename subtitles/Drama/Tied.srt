1
00:01:35,554 --> 00:01:37,848
Love stories are private planets.

2
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:47,692
They evaporate when
their inhabitants leave.

3
00:01:56,826 --> 00:02:00,788
They obey laws unknown to
the rest of the universe.

4
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,459
Unknown even to those
who inhabit them.

5
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:22,977
Can you find my passport'?

6
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:25,646
- Where're you going?
- To Australia.

7
00:02:25,688 --> 00:02:28,149
- What happened'?
- don't know.

8
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,443
Don't know.

9
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:33,154
Don't know.

10
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:47,460
We're judged after laws that weren't
ours at the time they were made.

11
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:56,177
You met him one spring evening.

12
00:02:56,761 --> 00:02:58,929
You became his mistress.

13
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:01,932
He wanted to marry you.

14
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:06,520
He didn't keep his promise.

15
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:26,517
Mademoiselle, you're expected.

16
00:04:26,851 --> 00:04:28,936
It's all the way up the stairs.

17
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,060
Come closer.

18
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:20,905
Turn around.

19
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:35,169
What you want from me'?

20
00:05:40,508 --> 00:05:42,218
Do you want my cock'?

21
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:44,679
That's it, huh'?

22
00:05:45,805 --> 00:05:47,848
No. You want money'?

23
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:50,393
What an irresistible smell.

24
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:59,318
What do you want'?

25
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:02,780
Do you want my money'?

26
00:06:03,322 --> 00:06:04,824
You want my skin?

27
00:06:06,242 --> 00:06:07,326
Come.

28
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:12,498
What do you want'?

29
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:15,793
You want my skin, bitch.

30
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,048
Come on, hit me.

31
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,553
Again, common.

32
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:26,762
Common.

33
00:10:16,117 --> 00:10:17,326
Good evening.

34
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:27,670
Good evening.

35
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,472
Take off your shirt

36
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:44,812
Hurry UP-

37
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:56,240
Turn around.

38
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,625
Get on your knees.

39
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,386
Hit me.

40
00:11:20,056 --> 00:11:21,849
- What'?
- Hit me.

41
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:24,185
- Hit me.
- What'?

42
00:11:29,357 --> 00:11:32,068
- Is that what you want'?
- Yes, yes.

43
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:33,319
Say it!

44
00:11:35,613 --> 00:11:37,448
More.

45
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:41,952
Yes.

46
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:51,045
- Is this what you want'?
- Hit me.

47
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,214
Stop to feed him.
You'll spoil him.

48
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:36,966
Funny you say that.

49
00:12:42,972 --> 00:12:46,851
"Silence means consent."
Isn't it so'?

50
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:52,064
I'm not your father,
don't be silly.

51
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:54,275
Be a man and do it.

52
00:12:57,737 --> 00:12:59,530
That's it'?

53
00:13:02,742 --> 00:13:04,160
Look at me.

54
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,569
This shithead lets me wait.

55
00:13:40,571 --> 00:13:43,074
My asshole father did that too.

56
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:02,551
You won't live so far away
without a reason.

57
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:07,390
You must be crazy to live here.

58
00:14:17,483 --> 00:14:20,653
Didn't you want to ask me
something important'?

59
00:14:21,821 --> 00:14:23,197
If had known,

60
00:14:23,322 --> 00:14:26,242
I'd have brought
some films for fun.

61
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:27,993
Mademoiselle.

62
00:14:30,663 --> 00:14:32,331
Will you dine with us'?

63
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:36,544
No, thank you.

64
00:14:57,606 --> 00:14:59,275
Who is this whore'?

65
00:15:01,318 --> 00:15:02,987
Where did you find her'?

66
00:15:08,868 --> 00:15:10,369
She's not a whore.

67
00:15:16,792 --> 00:15:18,377
She left?

68
00:15:22,173 --> 00:15:24,258
Do you think she loves you'?

69
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:28,137
Why do you think she's with you'?

70
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:34,352
She just wants your bucks.

71
00:15:36,771 --> 00:15:39,482
You'll have to pay her.

72
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:43,611
She's a whore.

73
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:46,864
You know that.

74
00:15:51,661 --> 00:15:53,954
You fall for whores.

75
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:01,420
Well.
What can do for you'?

76
00:16:05,383 --> 00:16:07,843
Renew my gun license.

77
00:16:38,374 --> 00:16:39,792
May I?

78
00:16:43,713 --> 00:16:44,880
Come.

79
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:31,093
Tell me...

80
00:17:31,761 --> 00:17:33,179
Tell me...

81
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:37,475
Will you kill me if ask you to'?

82
00:17:39,185 --> 00:17:41,395
Will you cut my throat'?

83
00:17:45,524 --> 00:17:47,693
Cut off my head'?

84
00:17:53,866 --> 00:17:55,034
Come.

85
00:18:00,247 --> 00:18:01,415
Come.

86
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:02,958
Come.

87
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:12,385
Tell me.

88
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:15,262
Tell me.

89
00:18:16,263 --> 00:18:17,807
Tell me.

90
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,851
Will you kill me'?

91
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:23,688
I'll kill you.

92
00:18:27,191 --> 00:18:29,568
Will you cut my throat'?

93
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:32,113
I'll cut your throat.

94
00:18:35,574 --> 00:18:38,786
Will you cutoff my head'?

95
00:18:38,828 --> 00:18:40,955
I'll cutoff your head.

96
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:14,780
Belong to you.

97
00:19:14,864 --> 00:19:16,323
Do you know it'?

98
00:19:45,603 --> 00:19:47,688
Have you been on vacation'?

99
00:19:48,773 --> 00:19:49,607
No.

100
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:56,072
Did you like Australia?

101
00:19:56,113 --> 00:19:58,491
Had no time to look around.

102
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,023
This is for you.

103
00:21:05,224 --> 00:21:06,434
Like them'?

104
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,521
Yes.

105
00:21:16,193 --> 00:21:17,486
And this...

106
00:21:20,573 --> 00:21:22,241
This is for me.

107
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:29,332
A Smith & Wesson 2...

108
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:32,376
A true marvel.

109
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:42,970
Come.

110
00:21:54,106 --> 00:21:56,317
No one has ever come here.

111
00:22:39,652 --> 00:22:42,738
I'll kill 20,000 people.

112
00:22:46,993 --> 00:22:49,370
Provided aim good enough.

113
00:23:19,608 --> 00:23:21,527
I'll keep this one.

114
00:23:21,652 --> 00:23:23,529
It's so handy.

115
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:26,365
In the drawer of my bedside table.

116
00:23:32,705 --> 00:23:34,123
Take it.

117
00:23:45,468 --> 00:23:48,012
Do you feel how cold it is'?

118
00:24:14,455 --> 00:24:16,123
This was perfect.

119
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,462
Reload it.
Reload it like showed you.

120
00:24:53,744 --> 00:24:54,829
I'm here.

121
00:25:02,962 --> 00:25:04,088
Continue.

122
00:25:05,047 --> 00:25:06,507
Common, go on

123
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,801
- No.
- Yes.

124
00:25:08,884 --> 00:25:09,885
No.

125
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:11,846
Common, aim!

126
00:25:12,888 --> 00:25:14,432
Aim, common now.

127
00:25:15,433 --> 00:25:17,435
- Come on.
- can't.

128
00:25:18,102 --> 00:25:20,980
It contains blanks,
I'm not crazy.

129
00:25:21,605 --> 00:25:22,690
Go ahead.

130
00:25:22,773 --> 00:25:24,275
You can do it.

131
00:25:24,358 --> 00:25:26,485
Show me, common.

132
00:25:27,153 --> 00:25:29,822
It's easy, take it.

133
00:25:30,698 --> 00:25:32,575
Aim at me. Aim.

134
00:25:35,703 --> 00:25:36,704
Common.

135
00:25:37,121 --> 00:25:38,289
Do it.

136
00:25:38,873 --> 00:25:39,832
Fire.

137
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:41,125
Fire!

138
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:42,376
Can't.

139
00:25:44,545 --> 00:25:45,546
Fire.

140
00:26:23,793 --> 00:26:25,836
Take it up again!

141
00:26:26,253 --> 00:26:27,505
Take it back!

142
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:30,424
Take it back, bitch!
Take it back!

143
00:26:31,967 --> 00:26:33,552
Take it back.

144
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,850
Take it back!

145
00:28:40,596 --> 00:28:42,890
Stop looking at me like that.

146
00:29:39,488 --> 00:29:40,531
It's hot.

147
00:29:40,698 --> 00:29:41,741
Yeah.

148
00:30:48,182 --> 00:30:49,433
Is this her'?

149
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:19,255
You stay there for good'?

150
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:21,966
Have a seat.

151
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:26,095
Sit down.

152
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:40,609
You want a drink'?

153
00:31:40,735 --> 00:31:42,111
No, thank you.

154
00:31:55,833 --> 00:31:58,085
I've booked a room.

155
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:59,337
Which hotel'?

156
00:31:59,462 --> 00:32:00,880
A hourly hotel.

157
00:32:05,885 --> 00:32:08,387
- What do you wanna do'?
- What one does

158
00:32:08,429 --> 00:32:11,724
with three whores
in a hourly hotel'?

159
00:32:11,932 --> 00:32:13,642
Aren't you used to it'?

160
00:32:16,854 --> 00:32:19,815
They're not evil,
they're nice like you.

161
00:32:19,899 --> 00:32:21,901
A slap from time to time.

162
00:32:23,402 --> 00:32:24,987
Nothing too serious.

163
00:32:32,286 --> 00:32:33,371
What's up?

164
00:32:33,496 --> 00:32:34,872
You're sulking?

165
00:33:53,534 --> 00:33:56,078
The guy has taken
the whole story.

166
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,289
That's real power.

167
00:33:58,372 --> 00:34:00,875
I'll need a cop at my door.

168
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:03,919
- Why'?
- One day, they'll pester me.

169
00:34:03,961 --> 00:34:04,795
Who?

170
00:34:13,095 --> 00:34:14,847
Well dude,

171
00:34:15,056 --> 00:34:17,099
still as paranoid'?

172
00:34:19,226 --> 00:34:22,063
In my office,
we'll be In peace.

173
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,320
I'll give you money.

174
00:35:55,531 --> 00:35:56,949
One million.

175
00:35:58,951 --> 00:36:00,911
And then I'll marry you.

176
00:36:02,413 --> 00:36:04,498
It is a token of love.

177
00:36:04,582 --> 00:36:06,083
Promise.

178
00:36:20,014 --> 00:36:21,682
Why do you do it'?

179
00:36:24,602 --> 00:36:26,062
Because love you.

180
00:36:29,357 --> 00:36:30,941
Don't you believe me'?

181
00:36:37,448 --> 00:36:40,117
One million dollars.
It's a nice sum.

182
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:44,413
Obviously... you can do many
things with a million, right'?

183
00:37:03,099 --> 00:37:04,141
Wait.

184
00:37:05,267 --> 00:37:06,852
Promise.

185
00:37:06,977 --> 00:37:08,646
Promise.

186
00:37:09,313 --> 00:37:11,023
Trust me.

187
00:37:11,148 --> 00:37:12,566
Look at me.

188
00:37:13,609 --> 00:37:15,194
Belong to you.

189
00:37:15,277 --> 00:37:16,654
You know that'?

190
00:37:59,322 --> 00:38:00,823
Your first name'?

191
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:03,284
Are you a cop or something'?

192
00:38:03,409 --> 00:38:05,244
Do look like a cop'?

193
00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:06,704
No.

194
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,415
That reassures me.

195
00:38:16,422 --> 00:38:18,257
Well, your name'?

196
00:38:23,387 --> 00:38:24,221
Bert)-

197
00:38:24,388 --> 00:38:25,639
It's pretty.-

198
00:38:27,433 --> 00:38:29,268
<i>It sounds like a kiss.</i>

199
00:38:43,491 --> 00:38:45,117
It's a whore's name.

200
00:38:57,254 --> 00:38:59,256
May introduce my shrink.

201
00:39:06,389 --> 00:39:10,184
Can you tell me what you think
about the future...

202
00:39:10,267 --> 00:39:13,104
of us as a couple.
If it's worth it.

203
00:39:13,145 --> 00:39:14,814
Worth what'?

204
00:39:14,939 --> 00:39:16,565
To marry.

205
00:39:17,441 --> 00:39:18,985
Tell me.

206
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:22,780
- I'm not clairvoyant.
- You know psychology.

207
00:39:22,822 --> 00:39:24,699
For 1806 Euro per session

208
00:39:24,949 --> 00:39:27,326
you could do something useful.

209
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:30,079
Ask her questions. What ever...

210
00:39:32,623 --> 00:39:34,875
Common. Do your job.

211
00:39:35,001 --> 00:39:37,169
Ask her questions.

212
00:39:37,795 --> 00:39:38,838
No, wait.

213
00:39:39,964 --> 00:39:41,924
A Tournedos for Monsieur.

214
00:39:43,384 --> 00:39:47,763
A grilled salmon without Bearnaise
and a Tartare.

215
00:39:47,888 --> 00:39:49,849
Two salads without dressing.

216
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:52,977
No fries with the meals.

217
00:39:53,019 --> 00:39:56,022
Very well, Monsieur.
No entries?

218
00:39:56,063 --> 00:39:57,148
No.

219
00:39:57,773 --> 00:40:01,986
We'll take a bottle of wine,
and a diet coke.

220
00:40:01,986 --> 00:40:06,449
- We have a Brouilly.
- Whatever, don't drink wine.

221
00:40:08,826 --> 00:40:11,329
Well, common. Ask her questions.

222
00:40:11,412 --> 00:40:15,750
- You still order the dishes
for other people. - Yes.

223
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:17,501
Who cares.

224
00:40:18,002 --> 00:40:19,587
Ask her questions.

225
00:40:20,671 --> 00:40:23,424
- Then she should come
to my office. - Obey.

226
00:40:27,345 --> 00:40:28,471
Go ahead.

227
00:40:31,182 --> 00:40:33,642
Yes, take your little book.

228
00:40:36,187 --> 00:40:38,022
Tell me your story.

229
00:40:39,607 --> 00:40:40,900
Have none.

230
00:40:40,983 --> 00:40:44,153
But...
everyone has a story.

231
00:40:45,071 --> 00:40:47,156
Didn't your father abuse you'?

232
00:40:48,491 --> 00:40:50,409
It must have been traumatic,

233
00:40:50,534 --> 00:40:51,452
right'?

234
00:40:53,037 --> 00:40:54,955
Tell Monsieur.

235
00:40:55,081 --> 00:40:57,667
- Have nothing to say.
- Talk now!

236
00:40:57,708 --> 00:40:58,751
Calm down.

237
00:41:01,128 --> 00:41:03,589
Don't tell me to calm down.
Is that clear'?

238
00:41:03,714 --> 00:41:05,424
Don't tell me that.

239
00:41:05,508 --> 00:41:09,595
Let's go, you'll do it
in your office.

240
00:41:09,845 --> 00:41:12,932
Don't try to pump her for fees,
understood'?

241
00:41:13,182 --> 00:41:14,392
Come on.

242
00:41:14,934 --> 00:41:16,894
Asshole of a shrink...

243
00:41:24,026 --> 00:41:25,111
Charlatan.

244
00:41:26,737 --> 00:41:29,281
You ask a service...
and get bullshit!

245
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,076
Fucking shrink.

246
00:41:32,743 --> 00:41:33,786
Rascal.

247
00:41:40,626 --> 00:41:42,294
Not here, sweetheart.

248
00:42:28,007 --> 00:42:29,717
What's going on'?

249
00:42:39,018 --> 00:42:40,519
Don't you answer'?

250
00:42:44,398 --> 00:42:48,069
Beware of this man,
he's unpredictable.

251
00:42:53,074 --> 00:42:54,575
"Unpredictable"?

252
00:42:58,412 --> 00:43:00,247
You have no idea.

253
00:43:13,052 --> 00:43:15,638
Can't fight the unavoidable.

254
00:43:16,972 --> 00:43:18,307
Do you like him'?

255
00:43:22,603 --> 00:43:24,480
You don't understand.

256
00:43:24,647 --> 00:43:26,065
Obviously.

257
00:43:26,273 --> 00:43:30,403
If accept this situation,
it's my problem, not yours.

258
00:43:33,698 --> 00:43:35,116
Sorry.

259
00:44:22,204 --> 00:44:24,332
Why're you doing this to me'?

260
00:45:10,002 --> 00:45:14,632
What do you want'?
Money'? have plenty.

261
00:45:16,425 --> 00:45:19,970
You want my money,
huh, right'?

262
00:45:20,304 --> 00:45:22,515
My money interests you, huh'?

263
00:45:22,556 --> 00:45:24,100
It's my money.

264
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:30,398
- Who's talking about money'?
- I'll give you money.

265
00:45:31,941 --> 00:45:34,068
I'll give you what you want.

266
00:45:35,027 --> 00:45:37,446
Don't care about your money!

267
00:45:39,323 --> 00:45:40,533
Don't care!

268
00:45:45,913 --> 00:45:47,289
Hit me.

269
00:45:47,373 --> 00:45:49,250
Hit me, hit me.

270
00:45:49,333 --> 00:45:50,876
Please.

271
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:52,420
Go ahead.

272
00:46:06,684 --> 00:46:08,102
It's alright.

273
00:46:09,603 --> 00:46:11,772
- It's alright.
- Shut up.

274
00:46:30,249 --> 00:46:33,419
- When will you go to New York'?
- Soon.

275
00:46:36,213 --> 00:46:38,007
For how long'?

276
00:46:38,883 --> 00:46:40,301
Dunno.

277
00:46:41,844 --> 00:46:43,596
Will you miss me'?

278
00:47:03,991 --> 00:47:06,869
- Are you out of form'?
- I'm tired.

279
00:47:07,578 --> 00:47:09,163
Enjoy your holidays.

280
00:47:12,249 --> 00:47:13,167
What'?

281
00:47:19,173 --> 00:47:22,677
- We can't continue like this.
- Maybe.

282
00:47:28,683 --> 00:47:30,476
What do you think'?

283
00:47:33,562 --> 00:47:36,148
Do you really think
I wanna marry you'?

284
00:47:40,528 --> 00:47:42,697
Can you imagine the headlines'?

285
00:47:42,697 --> 00:47:47,410
"The Black Prince of Finance,
the 38th richest Frenchman, marries

286
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:51,747
a poor girl who serves him
as his sex toy."

287
00:48:04,385 --> 00:48:05,845
And your husband'?

288
00:48:06,387 --> 00:48:09,724
- Thought about him'?
- You know we're not married.

289
00:48:48,846 --> 00:48:52,266
Won't give one million just
for your beautiful eyes.

290
00:48:58,439 --> 00:49:00,358
We should stop it.

291
00:49:07,531 --> 00:49:08,574
Agreed.

292
00:49:19,418 --> 00:49:21,253
We'll see when you get back.

293
00:49:21,337 --> 00:49:22,797
It's over.

294
00:49:28,302 --> 00:49:29,887
No problem.

295
00:49:38,437 --> 00:49:40,564
You're a whore.

296
00:49:40,648 --> 00:49:43,442
Girls like you are
easy to find.

297
00:49:48,239 --> 00:49:51,367
Put the keys on the nightstand.

298
00:49:55,496 --> 00:49:57,081
Do what tell you.

299
00:50:36,787 --> 00:50:39,123
Can sit beside you'?

300
00:50:41,042 --> 00:50:42,209
Of course.

301
00:52:27,982 --> 00:52:29,608
Know you're there!

302
00:52:33,321 --> 00:52:34,822
Show yourself!

303
00:52:42,246 --> 00:52:44,123
Know you're there,

304
00:52:44,248 --> 00:52:49,337
in your crappy house,
watching IV from your couch

305
00:52:49,378 --> 00:52:50,838
Show yourself!

306
00:52:53,716 --> 00:52:58,304
Your tiny prick curled
in your little panties.

307
00:52:59,096 --> 00:53:02,058
Do you have balls
to open the door'?

308
00:53:04,352 --> 00:53:06,187
Open the door!

309
00:53:06,312 --> 00:53:07,897
Don't open.

310
00:53:08,022 --> 00:53:09,690
Open the door!

311
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:14,236
Open up or smash
your fucking old door!

312
00:53:14,278 --> 00:53:15,404
Open!

313
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:28,292
Want to talk to her.

314
00:53:49,021 --> 00:53:50,272
Where's she'?

315
00:53:51,691 --> 00:53:54,777
- Want to talk to her.
- She's not here.

316
00:53:54,819 --> 00:53:59,448
- Tell me where that bitch is hiding.
- Don't insult my wife.

317
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:02,326
Your wife?

318
00:54:02,827 --> 00:54:04,203
Your wife?

319
00:54:04,286 --> 00:54:08,124
You're not fucking married.
She is just a whore!

320
00:54:08,207 --> 00:54:09,917
She isn't anyone's.

321
00:54:10,042 --> 00:54:11,460
She's a whore.

322
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:14,922
Look at yourself.

323
00:54:16,298 --> 00:54:17,967
You look like my father.

324
00:54:18,092 --> 00:54:21,262
You know what did with him'?
killed him.

325
00:54:21,345 --> 00:54:23,806
Can you hear me'?
killed him.

326
00:54:23,848 --> 00:54:25,725
Could kill you too.

327
00:54:25,891 --> 00:54:29,520
It disgusts me what
you do together.

328
00:54:31,647 --> 00:54:33,691
Could kill you.

329
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:39,822
Why don't you say anything'?

330
00:54:41,866 --> 00:54:42,783
Huh?

331
00:54:49,081 --> 00:54:50,374
Are you sick?

332
00:54:52,752 --> 00:54:54,587
You're going to die, that's it'?

333
00:54:57,590 --> 00:54:59,008
You're going to die.

334
00:55:02,511 --> 00:55:05,598
Let me talk to her, please.

335
00:55:08,309 --> 00:55:10,144
My money interests her.

336
00:55:10,269 --> 00:55:11,729
It drives me crazy.

337
00:55:12,938 --> 00:55:14,273
Don't touch me.

338
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:18,653
You're wrong.

339
00:55:30,706 --> 00:55:34,460
- You want a glass of water'?
- No, thank you.

340
00:55:36,003 --> 00:55:38,464
- Champagne'?
- No.

341
00:55:45,221 --> 00:55:47,223
My name is not Betty.

342
00:55:49,016 --> 00:55:50,518
Suspected that.

343
00:56:07,159 --> 00:56:08,828
Are you married'?

344
00:56:10,204 --> 00:56:11,330
If ailed.

345
00:56:12,123 --> 00:56:13,082
Me too.

346
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:14,375
Really'?

347
00:56:14,959 --> 00:56:16,711
What happened'?

348
00:56:16,836 --> 00:56:18,087
Nothing.

349
00:56:21,048 --> 00:56:22,299
That's life.

350
00:56:29,223 --> 00:56:31,058
Where's the Champagne'?

351
00:56:32,309 --> 00:56:34,770
- You drank it last night.
- You should buy more.

352
00:56:34,854 --> 00:56:37,064
You know don't support it.

353
00:56:37,481 --> 00:56:38,441
Calm down.

354
00:56:50,661 --> 00:56:53,581
Never touched
his fucking million.

355
00:56:53,664 --> 00:56:57,001
Don't want
to use that money.

356
00:56:58,377 --> 00:57:00,463
That money, it was sacred.

357
00:57:00,713 --> 00:57:03,924
- What are you talking about'?
- I'd returned it.

358
00:57:05,259 --> 00:57:07,011
Calm down, sweetheart.

359
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:17,104
I'll tell him it's over.

360
00:57:58,771 --> 00:58:00,022
Good evening.

361
00:58:03,901 --> 00:58:05,152
Good evening.

362
00:58:07,488 --> 00:58:10,783
Stop the Champagne
apnd the Valigmg

363
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:13,327
Looks like a disorder.

364
00:58:14,161 --> 00:58:15,663
And it's not good.

365
00:58:16,163 --> 00:58:17,748
What was he like'?

366
00:58:18,749 --> 00:58:19,834
Tell me.

367
00:58:21,627 --> 00:58:26,757
"My poor Muse,
what ails you this morning?"

368
00:58:27,216 --> 00:58:31,137
"Your hollow eyes are
full of nocturnal visions;"

369
00:58:31,637 --> 00:58:35,558
"I see in turn reflected
on your face."

370
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:39,061
"Madness and horror
cold and taciturn."

371
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:40,730
Beautiful, huh'?

372
00:58:41,522 --> 00:58:45,693
Know you don't like
my silly poems.

373
00:58:45,693 --> 00:58:48,654
What is happening,
my little muse?

374
00:58:49,572 --> 00:58:50,740
Tell me.

375
00:58:51,991 --> 00:58:53,826
- You despise me.
- No.

376
00:58:53,951 --> 00:58:57,163
No, don't believe you.

377
00:59:12,678 --> 00:59:16,307
A plate of Foie Gras and
two Chateaubriand.

378
00:59:16,349 --> 00:59:17,850
How do you like it'?

379
00:59:19,602 --> 00:59:21,562
That's is a good question.

380
00:59:22,104 --> 00:59:23,397
Blue... blue.

381
00:59:24,649 --> 00:59:26,942
Bitches love raw meat, right'?

382
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:28,486
Blue.

383
01:00:05,439 --> 01:00:07,191
Are you crying'?

384
01:00:08,567 --> 01:00:10,611
Love to see you cry.

385
01:00:12,029 --> 01:00:14,156
Feel God inflicts crying.

386
01:00:16,575 --> 01:00:18,577
Me too, despise you.

387
01:00:20,204 --> 01:00:22,081
You're despicable.

388
01:00:23,582 --> 01:00:28,295
Because you're hard with the weak
and weak with the hard ones.

389
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:30,631
Despise you.

390
01:00:30,715 --> 01:00:32,883
You're poor, pitiful.

391
01:00:33,759 --> 01:00:35,302
You're a liar.

392
01:00:37,346 --> 01:00:41,058
You hate to lose,
so you have to pay.

393
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:42,560
You're a shit.

394
01:00:43,185 --> 01:00:45,479
You're a poor little shit.

395
01:00:52,862 --> 01:00:55,114
Give me the promised money.

396
01:00:55,239 --> 01:00:56,824
- No.
- Si.

397
01:00:57,325 --> 01:00:59,785
Tomorrow, 11am,
in front of your bank.

398
01:00:59,910 --> 01:01:03,664
You'll go to the counter
and unlock your account.

399
01:01:03,748 --> 01:01:06,459
You'll take out
my million in cash.

400
01:01:07,084 --> 01:01:10,921
We'll go into the toilet, I'll
take over the money

401
01:01:11,756 --> 01:01:14,633
and I'll make you
eat the bundles.

402
01:01:14,884 --> 01:01:17,553
I'll take them and use them

403
01:01:17,595 --> 01:01:20,348
to clean your flowing saliva

404
01:01:20,389 --> 01:01:23,184
while jerk you off
with my hand.

405
01:01:27,647 --> 01:01:29,440
You'll shamefully enjoy it.

406
01:01:29,815 --> 01:01:35,363
And your cum will ?ow like snot

407
01:01:35,988 --> 01:01:38,991
out from your little prick.

408
01:01:50,544 --> 01:01:52,004
Tomorrow morning.

409
01:01:53,631 --> 01:01:54,715
11am.

410
01:01:55,841 --> 01:01:57,468
Be in time.

411
01:03:07,038 --> 01:03:08,205
Go.

412
01:04:04,261 --> 01:04:09,100
"Ladies and gentlemen,
keep your seat belt fastened"

413
01:04:19,485 --> 01:04:26,075
"After the plane has stopped completely
open the luggage racks carefully..."

414
01:04:29,245 --> 01:04:31,998
Are you expected to arrive'?

415
01:04:34,333 --> 01:04:35,459
Yes.

416
01:04:36,585 --> 01:04:38,295
Then all is well.

417
01:05:51,661 --> 01:05:54,497
Waited for you yesterday,
in the bank.

418
01:05:56,165 --> 01:05:57,333
Really'?

419
01:06:04,382 --> 01:06:07,677
- Knew you wouldn't come.
- Really'?

420
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:10,012
You never keep your promises.

421
01:06:13,265 --> 01:06:14,934
What promises?

422
01:06:22,441 --> 01:06:24,151
What are you doing'?

423
01:06:27,154 --> 01:06:27,989
Come.

424
01:06:47,133 --> 01:06:48,342
This is it'?

425
01:06:49,051 --> 01:06:51,429
It's decided, my old.

426
01:06:52,346 --> 01:06:53,764
Come with me.

427
01:06:53,889 --> 01:06:55,057
Come.

428
01:07:02,398 --> 01:07:03,733
This yours'?

429
01:07:04,108 --> 01:07:05,234
Yes.

430
01:07:37,433 --> 01:07:38,643
Good bye.

431
01:08:38,244 --> 01:08:39,620
Sit.

432
01:14:10,618 --> 01:14:13,746
One million is quite
much for a whore.

433
01:14:15,956 --> 01:14:18,459
A little whore who
dislikes money.

434
01:14:26,342 --> 01:14:28,260
Come on, go ahead, shoot.

435
01:14:54,870 --> 01:14:59,000
