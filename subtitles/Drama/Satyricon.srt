1
00:01:01,508 --> 00:01:04,443
The earth has not managed to swallow
me into the abyss...

2
00:01:04,511 --> 00:01:07,537
nor has the sea engulfed me
with its raging storms.

3
00:01:07,614 --> 00:01:10,344
I have fled from the law
and escaped the arena.

4
00:01:10,417 --> 00:01:13,215
I've even stained my hands with blood...

5
00:01:13,286 --> 00:01:15,083
only to end up here, destitute...

6
00:01:15,155 --> 00:01:17,851
exiled from my country, abandoned!

7
00:01:18,392 --> 00:01:20,917
And who condemned me to be alone?

8
00:01:20,994 --> 00:01:23,462
Someone who bears the mark
of all known vices...

9
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,964
who should be banished
by his own admission.

10
00:01:26,032 --> 00:01:27,021
Ascyltus!

11
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,399
A young man who gained his freedom,
and now keeps it, through whoring.

12
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:31,869
Who gambled away his youth.

13
00:01:31,938 --> 00:01:35,066
Who sold himself as a woman,
even when he'd be approached as a man.

14
00:01:35,142 --> 00:01:37,007
And that tart Giton?

15
00:01:38,779 --> 00:01:43,546
On the Day of the Virile Toga
he wore a woman's stole.

16
00:01:43,617 --> 00:01:47,018
His mother had already convinced him
not to act like a man.

17
00:01:47,521 --> 00:01:50,115
In jail he was a whore...

18
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,057
capable of forsaking
the oldest of friendships.

19
00:01:53,527 --> 00:01:56,928
Shame on him. He's a disgrace!

20
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,725
And now, holding each other
in their arms...

21
00:02:00,801 --> 00:02:03,736
they spend entire nights together...

22
00:02:05,839 --> 00:02:07,431
and laugh at me.

23
00:02:10,944 --> 00:02:13,037
But I swear it won't end like this.

24
00:02:17,451 --> 00:02:20,511
I loved you, Giton, and I still do.

25
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,156
I can't share you with others,
because you're a part of me.

26
00:02:24,224 --> 00:02:26,124
You are me, you're my soul.

27
00:02:26,193 --> 00:02:29,026
My soul belongs to you.

28
00:02:29,095 --> 00:02:32,121
You're the sun, you're the sea,
you're the gods.

29
00:02:33,033 --> 00:02:35,627
The triumphant Ascyltus
escaped with his prey.

30
00:02:35,702 --> 00:02:37,897
I must find you no matter what...

31
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:40,735
or I'm no longer a man!

32
00:02:40,807 --> 00:02:42,707
Ascyltus!

33
00:02:58,658 --> 00:03:01,957
Encolpius is looking for me.
He wants revenge.

34
00:03:02,028 --> 00:03:05,464
I took his little friend away
with a scheming trick.

35
00:03:05,532 --> 00:03:07,193
He deserved to be tricked...

36
00:03:07,267 --> 00:03:09,098
the back alley murderer...

37
00:03:09,169 --> 00:03:12,627
who, like a bird of prey,
is ready to steal anything shiny.

38
00:03:12,706 --> 00:03:14,970
While he slept, drunk with wine...

39
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:18,101
I took Giton out from under him...

40
00:03:18,178 --> 00:03:20,009
and spent the sweetest of nights
with him.

41
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,015
Friendship can last
only as long as it's convenient.

42
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,278
That's what I think.

43
00:03:25,352 --> 00:03:28,515
At first the boy tried
to deny me his flower.

44
00:03:28,588 --> 00:03:30,317
Maybe he wanted to sleep.

45
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,950
But I drew my sword and told him...

46
00:03:33,026 --> 00:03:36,621
"If you're Lucretia,
you've found your Tarquin."

47
00:03:36,696 --> 00:03:39,688
Today a famous actor..
a who-doesn't-know-him?..

48
00:03:39,766 --> 00:03:41,666
offered to buy him.

49
00:03:41,735 --> 00:03:43,896
At the sight of money
I gave up my little slave.

50
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,939
Then, while I was walking around
the city, a fine older gentleman...

51
00:03:47,007 --> 00:03:50,272
approached me and brought me here
to the baths.

52
00:03:50,343 --> 00:03:53,938
In a dark corner he started to touch me.
He was so insistent!

53
00:03:56,483 --> 00:03:59,043
But I see Encolpius coming,
livid with anger.

54
00:03:59,119 --> 00:04:01,781
I'll have to defend myself or run away.

55
00:04:04,758 --> 00:04:06,658
Looking for me, Encolpius?

56
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,884
Here I am.

57
00:04:08,361 --> 00:04:10,522
Where's Giton?

58
00:04:34,487 --> 00:04:36,148
Where is Giton?

59
00:04:36,222 --> 00:04:38,554
-I'll kill you, you whore.
-I sold him.

60
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:43,289
-Where is Giton?
-I sold him to Vernacchio, the actor.

61
00:05:34,047 --> 00:05:36,982
Applaud, applaud, applaud.

62
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:35,330
And with this I punish
my erring arm.

63
00:07:41,775 --> 00:07:44,107
Who is more fortunate than we are?

64
00:07:44,177 --> 00:07:48,477
We get to see our divine Caesar's
new miracle.

65
00:07:49,682 --> 00:07:51,582
Come!

66
00:07:53,653 --> 00:07:55,883
Caesar, with his great soul...

67
00:07:55,955 --> 00:07:59,186
and Eros, with his thousand charms,
came down to Earth.

68
00:08:08,201 --> 00:08:09,634
Vernacchio...

69
00:08:09,702 --> 00:08:11,397
I denounce you in front of everyone.

70
00:08:11,471 --> 00:08:13,371
You must stop your performance.

71
00:08:14,107 --> 00:08:17,599
Oh, we have a master!
Now we have a master, too!

72
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:21,879
That boy is mine.
You must give him back to me.

73
00:08:21,948 --> 00:08:24,508
Are you a cavalier? A senator?

74
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:26,074
Come on up, my handsome young man.

75
00:08:26,152 --> 00:08:28,211
Vernacchio's home is hospitable
to everyone.

76
00:08:28,788 --> 00:08:30,881
Come on...

77
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,550
Wait.

78
00:08:35,628 --> 00:08:38,688
First I want you to meet my family...

79
00:08:38,832 --> 00:08:40,697
and my slaves...

80
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:41,961
watch out for the dog!

81
00:08:44,537 --> 00:08:47,005
Giton, hurry, let's go.

82
00:08:47,106 --> 00:08:49,734
But he's beautiful! And those muscles!

83
00:08:49,809 --> 00:08:51,970
He cost me 35 denari.

84
00:08:52,145 --> 00:08:55,410
A suckling pig weighing the same
would cost a lot more!

85
00:08:55,481 --> 00:08:57,506
Listen, Vernacchio...

86
00:08:57,784 --> 00:08:59,445
I know you're a famous actor...

87
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,113
and I've just seen some of your
many talents...

88
00:09:02,188 --> 00:09:05,180
but I repeat, the boy is mine.

89
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:10,724
That bastard who sold him to you
wasn't authorized to do so.

90
00:09:12,398 --> 00:09:15,959
I ask you not to appeal
to the magistrate. It's useless.

91
00:09:16,135 --> 00:09:18,126
Giton will be leaving with me.

92
00:09:21,074 --> 00:09:24,339
I'll buy the boy for 40 sesterces.

93
00:09:24,477 --> 00:09:26,945
45 sesterces from me!

94
00:09:28,748 --> 00:09:31,046
For 60 I'll buy the boy.

95
00:09:36,356 --> 00:09:38,688
Sir, this boy is more than a wife.

96
00:09:38,758 --> 00:09:41,420
And what free citizen
would sell his wife?

97
00:09:41,494 --> 00:09:43,018
He's neat, he's wise.

98
00:09:43,096 --> 00:09:45,064
I always come home to a lighted fire.

99
00:09:45,131 --> 00:09:47,895
And I'm training him
in the great art of the stage.

100
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:50,128
You'll see how well
he'll play female roles...

101
00:09:50,203 --> 00:09:53,639
Helen of Menelaus,
faithful Penelope, Cornelia.

102
00:09:53,706 --> 00:09:55,469
Such a treasure has no price!

103
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,210
I'll give you what you paid for him,
and no more!

104
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,475
Giton is leaving with me.

105
00:10:07,587 --> 00:10:09,384
No, never!

106
00:10:17,163 --> 00:10:21,156
Vernacchio, your behavior
has become intolerable.

107
00:10:21,234 --> 00:10:25,762
We've already punished you once
for joking about Caesar...

108
00:10:25,838 --> 00:10:27,999
but you continue to stir up trouble!

109
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:32,142
Let the young man have his slave back...

110
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:34,473
or tomorrow I'll burn down your theatre.

111
00:10:34,547 --> 00:10:36,014
It's not true that Vernacchio...

112
00:10:36,082 --> 00:10:39,779
Watch out, Vernacchio,
we're tired of your arrogance.

113
00:10:39,852 --> 00:10:44,721
Please, sir, I beg you,
don't destroy my theatre. I beg you!

114
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:47,817
Vernacchio is meek,
Vernacchio is obedient...

115
00:10:47,894 --> 00:10:49,725
Caesar knows that!

116
00:11:33,272 --> 00:11:35,263
Look who's here.

117
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:39,340
Calpurnia, where do we live?

118
00:11:39,645 --> 00:11:42,773
What do you mean, where?
Here, my beautiful boys.

119
00:11:42,849 --> 00:11:44,840
There he is.

120
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:49,420
Come on, let's go see the little sisters.
Come on, come on.

121
00:11:51,824 --> 00:11:54,850
Come here, come on!

122
00:12:18,017 --> 00:12:20,611
This is a lucky day for you.

123
00:12:20,686 --> 00:12:22,813
You wanted a fertile bride?

124
00:12:23,923 --> 00:12:26,448
The reddish-brown color of this liver...

125
00:12:26,526 --> 00:12:28,892
says this woman is pregnant.

126
00:13:09,602 --> 00:13:12,298
Hold on, "Blue Eyes."
Have you heard of me?

127
00:13:12,371 --> 00:13:14,635
Everywhere. You're quite famous.

128
00:13:14,874 --> 00:13:15,863
Giton...

129
00:18:08,134 --> 00:18:11,501
So, my old friend...

130
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,060
what's this?

131
00:18:13,139 --> 00:18:15,630
One tent for the two of you?

132
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:19,269
Listen, Ascyltus, it's too hard
to go back to being friends.

133
00:18:19,578 --> 00:18:21,705
So, let's divide up
our shared property...

134
00:18:21,781 --> 00:18:24,682
and try to be more fortunate.
We'll go our separate ways.

135
00:18:29,522 --> 00:18:31,456
You're still studying...
So am I.

136
00:18:31,524 --> 00:18:33,515
We're becoming the laughing stock
of the whole city.

137
00:18:34,126 --> 00:18:37,152
Why did you run off today while we were
speaking to the master?

138
00:18:37,229 --> 00:18:39,561
What else could I do? I was starving.

139
00:18:39,632 --> 00:18:41,827
I don't want to stand in the way
of your plans...

140
00:18:41,901 --> 00:18:44,062
so to avoid competing with you,
I'll go my own way.

141
00:18:44,136 --> 00:18:46,502
Fine, so let's divide our things.

142
00:18:50,743 --> 00:18:52,904
That's mine, and so is this.

143
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,581
The mirror...is mine.

144
00:19:02,788 --> 00:19:04,119
That's mine!

145
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:06,981
And now, let's divide up the boy.

146
00:19:12,865 --> 00:19:14,457
Ascyltus, you must be joking.

147
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:16,564
Let's let him decide.

148
00:19:21,974 --> 00:19:23,134
With you.

149
00:21:46,418 --> 00:21:48,318
Ganymede...

150
00:21:49,755 --> 00:21:51,484
Narcissus...

151
00:21:51,957 --> 00:21:55,859
Apollo, who turned the young man's
shadow into a flower.

152
00:21:56,528 --> 00:21:59,361
All the myths speak to us of love...

153
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:02,229
of unrivalled unions.

154
00:22:03,002 --> 00:22:06,096
But I took into my heart a cruel guest.

155
00:22:06,171 --> 00:22:08,469
I'm a poet.

156
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:11,908
You might ask,
"Why are you dressed so poorly?"

157
00:22:12,411 --> 00:22:14,470
Precisely the point...

158
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:18,111
A passion for art never made anyone rich.

159
00:22:19,251 --> 00:22:22,482
I don't know why, but poverty
is always a sister to genius.

160
00:22:22,588 --> 00:22:24,317
My name is Eumolpus.

161
00:22:26,025 --> 00:22:30,121
The masterpieces you see in this gallery
confirm our current lack of energy.

162
00:22:30,195 --> 00:22:33,289
Today no one would know how
to paint like this.

163
00:22:33,899 --> 00:22:37,062
So what brought on this sad state?

164
00:22:37,136 --> 00:22:39,502
The desire for money!

165
00:22:41,607 --> 00:22:46,408
Once upon a time, man's ideal
was virtue, pure and simple.

166
00:22:46,712 --> 00:22:49,374
That's why the liberal arts flourished.

167
00:22:49,448 --> 00:22:52,679
Eudoxus grew old on a mountain studying
the movement of the planets.

168
00:22:53,052 --> 00:22:56,453
Lysippus kept drawing the same model
his whole life...

169
00:22:57,222 --> 00:22:59,520
and died of hunger.

170
00:22:59,591 --> 00:23:02,617
But we, with our drinking and whoring...

171
00:23:02,695 --> 00:23:06,096
don't even know the masterpieces
that exist now.

172
00:23:06,165 --> 00:23:08,065
What about dialectical discussion?

173
00:23:08,133 --> 00:23:10,465
What happened to astronomy?

174
00:23:10,536 --> 00:23:14,370
Where is philosophy
that once led the way for us?

175
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:18,271
Don't be surprised
that the art of painting is dead...

176
00:23:18,343 --> 00:23:21,540
when now we find more beauty
in a pot of gold...

177
00:23:21,613 --> 00:23:24,173
than in the works of Apelles or Phydias.

178
00:23:24,483 --> 00:23:27,384
Those crazy Greeks!

179
00:23:29,788 --> 00:23:31,688
His land provides everything:

180
00:23:31,757 --> 00:23:33,657
wool, lemon, peppers:

181
00:23:33,726 --> 00:23:36,251
Looking for hen's milk? He'll have it:

182
00:23:36,328 --> 00:23:37,989
What was it like before?

183
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:42,830
Believe me, you wouldn't have taken
apiece of bread from him:

184
00:23:42,901 --> 00:23:46,098
Now he's so rich, even he doesn 't know
how much he has:

185
00:23:46,672 --> 00:23:48,833
And, he thinks he's a poet!

186
00:23:48,907 --> 00:23:52,035
But there isn't a drop
of poetry in his verses.

187
00:23:52,111 --> 00:23:54,375
And do you know
what this bastard calls me?

188
00:23:54,446 --> 00:23:57,074
"Colleague", "Brother"...

189
00:23:57,149 --> 00:23:58,138
"Soul mates", he says.

190
00:23:58,217 --> 00:24:00,708
At his table I have the best seat.

191
00:24:00,786 --> 00:24:03,186
I drink his wine,
not what he serves the other guests.

192
00:24:03,255 --> 00:24:05,746
You've escaped torture
because you're a Roman citizen...

193
00:24:05,824 --> 00:24:08,884
but you'll get a beating from
my own slaves!

194
00:24:08,961 --> 00:24:11,088
Your mouth is a cesspool!

195
00:24:11,163 --> 00:24:14,655
You'll be flogged
and your back broken, you dog!

196
00:24:14,733 --> 00:24:17,099
I've already broken the back
of that pimp son of yours.

197
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:19,194
I'll throw you in jail!

198
00:24:19,271 --> 00:24:21,398
You ought to be hanged!

199
00:24:53,172 --> 00:24:57,074
Never mind, even Venus was cross-eyed.

200
00:25:53,866 --> 00:25:56,334
Eumolpus, you've come, too, brother.

201
00:25:56,401 --> 00:25:59,893
Your presence fills me with emotion...

202
00:25:59,972 --> 00:26:02,031
because you're like me.

203
00:26:02,107 --> 00:26:04,473
-You're too kind.
-A talented man.

204
00:26:04,543 --> 00:26:06,909
We poets have a true friendship.

205
00:26:06,979 --> 00:26:08,469
And who are you two?

206
00:26:52,724 --> 00:26:55,488
You must try the wine..
do it honor.

207
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,255
Fish have to swim...

208
00:26:57,696 --> 00:27:00,324
but thanks to the gods,
I don't have to buy anything.

209
00:27:00,532 --> 00:27:06,061
All of these delicious things
come from my own property...

210
00:27:06,138 --> 00:27:07,366
Whatever that is!

211
00:27:07,439 --> 00:27:10,636
They say somewhere between
Terracina and Taranto.

212
00:27:11,209 --> 00:27:13,939
I must cross over to Sicily...

213
00:27:14,012 --> 00:27:17,379
because I want to take a trip to Africa.

214
00:27:17,582 --> 00:27:20,449
Whether on foot, on horseback,
or on the sea...

215
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:22,453
I never want to leave my own property...

216
00:27:22,521 --> 00:27:26,651
like "the ever-wandering Ulysses."

217
00:27:26,725 --> 00:27:29,216
Did you like my quotation?

218
00:27:29,928 --> 00:27:33,364
The classics fit in,
even at the dinner table.

219
00:27:43,075 --> 00:27:45,600
This is the first beard I shaved off.

220
00:27:45,677 --> 00:27:48,373
I was fully-grown at 14.

221
00:27:48,447 --> 00:27:50,642
And these are my household gods...

222
00:27:51,049 --> 00:27:53,882
protectors of our properties.

223
00:27:53,986 --> 00:27:56,420
Great Business, Great Satisfaction,
and Great Profit...

224
00:27:56,488 --> 00:27:58,479
May it please the gods.

225
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,225
-Which division are you from?
-The 40th.

226
00:28:10,302 --> 00:28:12,327
Born here, or did I buy you?

227
00:28:12,404 --> 00:28:16,204
Neither.
Pansa left me to you in his will.

228
00:28:16,274 --> 00:28:18,003
Cook this well.

229
00:28:18,076 --> 00:28:21,637
If you don't, I'll transfer you
to the sweeping division.

230
00:28:21,713 --> 00:28:24,739
There once were a rich man
and a poor man who started fighting.

231
00:28:24,816 --> 00:28:27,307
What is a poor man?

232
00:28:27,386 --> 00:28:30,014
That's a good one!

233
00:28:35,794 --> 00:28:37,989
I'm going to the pot.

234
00:28:38,163 --> 00:28:40,358
The daylight is fading.

235
00:28:40,432 --> 00:28:42,457
In the blink of an eye, it's night...

236
00:28:42,534 --> 00:28:45,560
There's nothing better than rolling out
of bed straight into dinner.

237
00:28:45,637 --> 00:28:49,004
It's been so cold that a bath
hardly warms me up.

238
00:28:49,074 --> 00:28:51,508
People are less than flies, much less.

239
00:28:51,576 --> 00:28:55,910
They have a certain resistance,
at least, but we are nothing but bubbles.

240
00:28:56,014 --> 00:29:00,576
"Here today, gone tomorrow," said
the farmer who'd lost his speckled pig.

241
00:29:13,065 --> 00:29:16,762
Lead turned to gold in his hands,
his hair blacker than a crow.

242
00:29:16,835 --> 00:29:19,463
He was over 70 and still going at it.

243
00:29:19,538 --> 00:29:22,200
Even his dog wasn't safe around him!

244
00:30:20,031 --> 00:30:22,295
What? You've already cooked it?

245
00:30:22,367 --> 00:30:24,858
Without even gutting it?

246
00:30:24,936 --> 00:30:27,962
And this is how you bring it to me?
Call in the cook!

247
00:30:28,373 --> 00:30:30,864
You cooked it whole...without gutting it?

248
00:30:31,143 --> 00:30:32,872
Mercy, master, mercy!

249
00:30:32,944 --> 00:30:34,639
Tie him up and whip him!

250
00:30:34,713 --> 00:30:37,045
I made a mistake. Have mercy on me!

251
00:30:37,115 --> 00:30:39,379
Pardon him, pardon him!

252
00:30:43,188 --> 00:30:45,213
What are you waiting for, you wretch?

253
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:46,951
Gut it here, now!

254
00:30:54,533 --> 00:30:56,967
How wonderful!

255
00:30:57,035 --> 00:31:02,098
Thrushes, fatted hens,
bird gizzards!

256
00:31:02,174 --> 00:31:03,163
Sausage ropes...

257
00:31:03,241 --> 00:31:05,505
tender plucked doves...

258
00:31:05,577 --> 00:31:09,069
Snails, livers, ham, offal...

259
00:31:17,322 --> 00:31:19,313
What's so funny?

260
00:31:19,391 --> 00:31:21,382
Don't you like my master's extravagances?

261
00:31:21,459 --> 00:31:24,622
Are you wealthier?
Do you give better banquets?

262
00:31:24,696 --> 00:31:27,426
Blockhead, scoundrel, tramp.
You dare laugh?

263
00:31:27,499 --> 00:31:31,196
Are you a cavalier?
That would make me the emperor's son!

264
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:33,362
Did Papa buy you a goat?

265
00:31:33,438 --> 00:31:35,133
I was laughing because it's funny.

266
00:31:35,207 --> 00:31:38,643
You're not worth your own piss...
and you stink!

267
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:41,338
Did you buy your freedom? I'm a freeman.

268
00:31:41,413 --> 00:31:43,438
I feed 20 mouths and a dog.

269
00:31:43,515 --> 00:31:45,210
I bought my wife's freedom...

270
00:31:45,283 --> 00:31:48,377
and now no one can wipe
his hands on her tits.

271
00:31:48,453 --> 00:31:49,545
But what do you do?

272
00:31:49,621 --> 00:31:52,954
-If you answer him, you'll just...
-You're just a fart in the water...

273
00:31:54,092 --> 00:31:56,287
Enough of this nonsense, Hermeros.

274
00:31:56,361 --> 00:31:57,851
Have some patience.

275
00:31:57,929 --> 00:32:01,421
The boy's young, and his blood is hot.

276
00:32:01,499 --> 00:32:06,129
When you were a young cock,
you crowed, too.

277
00:32:06,204 --> 00:32:08,570
Give us some Homer! Begin!

278
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:28,521
I like to hear Greek while I'm eating.

279
00:33:27,252 --> 00:33:31,120
Eumolpus, brother poet,
do you understand the story?

280
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:34,557
Diomedes and Ganymede were brothers...

281
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:39,296
Helen was their sister.
Agamemnon abducted her...

282
00:33:39,364 --> 00:33:41,832
and Ajax went mad.

283
00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:19,131
Eumolpus, sit down
and empty a few more cups.

284
00:34:19,204 --> 00:34:21,172
You mangy dogs!

285
00:34:21,706 --> 00:34:23,503
You're nothing but slaves!

286
00:34:23,575 --> 00:34:27,807
When did you ever pay
1/20 of your freedom?

287
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:30,143
Sewer whores!

288
00:34:30,215 --> 00:34:31,876
Ass lickers! Shit eaters!

289
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:34,341
Eumolpus, take it easy.

290
00:34:34,419 --> 00:34:37,479
We poets have a hard time of it...

291
00:34:37,789 --> 00:34:40,257
Listen to a few verses I've written...

292
00:34:40,325 --> 00:34:42,054
"The things you don't await

293
00:34:42,127 --> 00:34:43,992
Are sent to you by fate.

294
00:34:44,062 --> 00:34:47,429
And Fortune up on high
Will cure us by and by.

295
00:34:47,499 --> 00:34:49,433
Cupbearer, waste no time.
Come pour us some more wine."

296
00:34:50,068 --> 00:34:52,093
A new Horace.

297
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:54,970
There's a new Horace in our midst.

298
00:35:05,049 --> 00:35:07,017
Go on and dance!

299
00:35:09,587 --> 00:35:12,852
Don't make me angry...
go on and dance!

300
00:37:00,331 --> 00:37:03,528
OnJuly 26th,
on Trimalchio's estate at Cumae...

301
00:37:03,601 --> 00:37:06,297
30 boys and 40 girls were born...

302
00:37:06,371 --> 00:37:10,330
The same day, the slave Eusebio crucified
for insults against our master...

303
00:37:10,408 --> 00:37:12,239
36 calves born...

304
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:16,303
Same day, a fire in
Trimalchio's Pompeian orchards...

305
00:37:16,381 --> 00:37:18,042
-Flames in the farmer's house...
-What?

306
00:37:18,116 --> 00:37:20,380
When did I buy orchards in Pompei?

307
00:37:21,452 --> 00:37:23,079
Wine and hot water.

308
00:37:23,154 --> 00:37:26,146
Sorry we're late. We were at a wake
at Scissa's house.

309
00:37:26,224 --> 00:37:29,751
One of his slaves died,
and half of the drink...

310
00:37:29,827 --> 00:37:33,194
had to be poured over
the poor boy's bones.

311
00:37:33,264 --> 00:37:35,960
Only you were missing.

312
00:37:36,034 --> 00:37:37,023
Blood pudding, giblets...

313
00:37:37,101 --> 00:37:39,729
a Spanish pastry with warm honey,
one snail for each person...

314
00:37:39,804 --> 00:37:43,331
and the main course,
bear with goose eggs!

315
00:37:43,408 --> 00:37:46,468
My wife ate so much of that dish...

316
00:37:46,544 --> 00:37:48,444
that she threw it all up.

317
00:37:48,513 --> 00:37:50,071
If bears can eat people...

318
00:37:50,148 --> 00:37:52,446
why shouldn't people be able to..?

319
00:37:52,517 --> 00:37:55,213
Hey, what is going on here?

320
00:37:55,286 --> 00:37:57,447
I'll split your head open!

321
00:37:57,522 --> 00:37:59,786
May I grow in wealth and not in weight...

322
00:37:59,857 --> 00:38:02,018
If I don't cut your ears off
when we get home.

323
00:38:04,562 --> 00:38:07,497
How does that sound, Aruspicius?

324
00:38:07,565 --> 00:38:10,090
That sound is clearer...

325
00:38:10,735 --> 00:38:12,600
a sign of change.

326
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:16,470
Are you expecting anyone this weekend?

327
00:38:16,541 --> 00:38:18,736
Try again.

328
00:38:19,143 --> 00:38:21,976
I'm happy for you; this sounds good.

329
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,411
A very well-bred young boy
who cheers up my life...

330
00:38:31,489 --> 00:38:33,923
and fills me with satisfaction...

331
00:38:34,025 --> 00:38:38,052
Come here. Don't you want to sit by me,
right by your old uncle?

332
00:38:38,129 --> 00:38:41,155
Have you ever seen
such a sweet little creature?

333
00:38:47,805 --> 00:38:50,239
I can't believe you're carrying on like
this right in front of me!

334
00:38:50,942 --> 00:38:54,070
You female pile of shit!
I bought you at the slave market...

335
00:38:54,145 --> 00:38:55,976
I turned you into a human being!

336
00:38:56,047 --> 00:38:58,208
What are you talking about?
You bought me?

337
00:38:58,282 --> 00:39:01,911
Habinnas, take her statue
out of my mausoleum...

338
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,447
Otherwise, we'll still be at each other
when we're dead.

339
00:39:04,722 --> 00:39:06,212
You battle-axe!

340
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:08,224
You're old and ugly...take that!

341
00:39:13,097 --> 00:39:16,328
I built her a palace, but listen to her!

342
00:39:16,401 --> 00:39:19,199
She's puffed-up like a frog!

343
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:21,932
But I'll make you bite your tongue!

344
00:39:23,508 --> 00:39:27,137
I love the boy because he's clever,
not because he's pretty.

345
00:39:27,211 --> 00:39:30,044
He already can divide by ten,
read a book on first sight...

346
00:39:30,114 --> 00:39:32,708
and he bought a chair for himself.

347
00:39:32,784 --> 00:39:34,843
Why are you still crying, you hag?

348
00:39:35,586 --> 00:39:38,487
Just remember you owe
all this luxurious living to me!

349
00:39:38,556 --> 00:39:42,458
I endured my master's advances
for 14 years.

350
00:39:42,527 --> 00:39:45,291
What's wrong with that?
The master gives the orders!

351
00:39:45,363 --> 00:39:47,456
I entertained the mistress, too.

352
00:39:47,532 --> 00:39:51,866
By the will of the gods I ended up
sharing the Emperor's inheritance.

353
00:39:51,936 --> 00:39:55,963
I built five ships and filled them with
lard, perfume, and slaves.

354
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,133
That started my fortune:

355
00:39:58,209 --> 00:40:00,473
everything I touched turned to gold.

356
00:40:00,545 --> 00:40:04,208
I was a cockroach, now I'm a king.
That's life.

357
00:40:04,282 --> 00:40:08,275
Stichus, prepare my burial vestments
and ointment...

358
00:40:08,352 --> 00:40:13,654
and bring the wine for washing my bones.

359
00:40:13,725 --> 00:40:16,285
Life passes like a shadow..

360
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,591
Sooner or later death
will come to us all.

361
00:40:19,664 --> 00:40:22,224
I just thought ofa poem.

362
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,961
Listen...

363
00:40:24,035 --> 00:40:27,527
"On a stage a troupe performs a mime.

364
00:40:27,605 --> 00:40:30,472
An actor plays the father,
Another one plays the son,

365
00:40:30,608 --> 00:40:33,805
A third plays the rich man
But as soon as the show ends

366
00:40:33,878 --> 00:40:38,008
The pretend faces vanish,
The real ones return."

367
00:40:38,082 --> 00:40:40,107
How's that for poetry, eh, Poet?

368
00:40:40,184 --> 00:40:41,981
To tell you the truth...

369
00:40:42,053 --> 00:40:44,681
you stole them from Lucretius.

370
00:40:44,756 --> 00:40:48,419
-What do you mean, you vagabond?
-"The pretend faces vanish...

371
00:40:48,493 --> 00:40:50,393
the real ones return!"

372
00:40:50,461 --> 00:40:52,429
That's Lucretius, that's Lucretius!

373
00:40:52,897 --> 00:40:54,592
Enough! These verses are mine,
you beggar!

374
00:40:55,666 --> 00:40:59,625
I'm a poet, you're not.
You don't write verses, you steal them!

375
00:40:59,704 --> 00:41:02,229
Nonsense...throw him into the oven.

376
00:41:02,306 --> 00:41:04,536
You vagrant! I fed you...

377
00:41:04,609 --> 00:41:06,474
I lifted you out of the gutter.

378
00:41:06,544 --> 00:41:08,774
I am the poet here!

379
00:41:08,846 --> 00:41:11,007
Throw this ingrate into the oven!

380
00:41:11,082 --> 00:41:14,108
I'll put you to shame in
front of all those people.

381
00:41:15,353 --> 00:41:17,844
I don't want to see him anymore,
that dog...

382
00:41:17,922 --> 00:41:20,482
that venomous snake! He's bad luck!

383
00:41:20,558 --> 00:41:22,287
I'm a philosopher!

384
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,796
Clown, thief! Let me go!

385
00:42:29,327 --> 00:42:31,625
Only a few emperors...

386
00:42:31,696 --> 00:42:34,631
have had a mausoleum comparable
to mine.

387
00:42:34,699 --> 00:42:36,564
Apenna is creating a work of art...

388
00:42:36,634 --> 00:42:39,899
It will all be covered with marble...

389
00:42:39,971 --> 00:42:42,735
with a pediment over 120 feet high.

390
00:42:42,807 --> 00:42:45,742
On the walls, Trimalchio's entire life...

391
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:48,142
And his ships, sails unfurled...

392
00:42:48,212 --> 00:42:49,941
And his favorite puppy dog.

393
00:42:56,053 --> 00:42:57,884
Listen to his epitaph:

394
00:42:57,955 --> 00:43:02,221
"Here lies Gaius Pompeius Trimalchio.

395
00:43:02,293 --> 00:43:05,091
A pious, strong, and faithful patron
who came from nothing...

396
00:43:05,162 --> 00:43:08,791
he left 30 million sesterces
and never listened to a philosopher."

397
00:43:08,866 --> 00:43:11,357
And the same be for you!

398
00:43:13,738 --> 00:43:17,003
Act like you're guests
at my funeral banquet.

399
00:43:17,074 --> 00:43:19,406
Eat, drink, and remember me.

400
00:43:19,477 --> 00:43:23,436
Call the musicians,
and have them play something pretty.

401
00:43:31,822 --> 00:43:34,290
Farewell...farewell...

402
00:43:40,431 --> 00:43:43,366
There...I'm dead.

403
00:43:46,337 --> 00:43:50,000
Gaius Pompeius Trimalchio...
Mecenas...

404
00:43:50,975 --> 00:43:52,704
Mecenas...

405
00:43:59,417 --> 00:44:02,181
A man so great is now dead.

406
00:44:04,355 --> 00:44:08,189
I've lost my best friend.

407
00:44:10,461 --> 00:44:13,658
Why didn't I die with him?

408
00:44:51,902 --> 00:44:53,893
I want to give you a gift...

409
00:44:53,971 --> 00:44:56,963
A bracelet of solid gold.

410
00:44:58,676 --> 00:45:00,507
Look, he gave me this...it's gold!

411
00:45:00,578 --> 00:45:02,068
Look, he gave me...

412
00:45:03,748 --> 00:45:05,648
And me! You're forgetting me!

413
00:45:05,716 --> 00:45:08,150
Please give me some earrings!

414
00:45:11,956 --> 00:45:16,393
That's it!
I'm not giving anyone anything!

415
00:45:20,965 --> 00:45:22,956
No one has ever been able to tell us...

416
00:45:23,034 --> 00:45:25,400
what the realm of the dead is like...

417
00:45:25,469 --> 00:45:27,494
whereas we all know...

418
00:45:27,571 --> 00:45:30,768
how much we like the realm of the living.

419
00:45:30,841 --> 00:45:34,436
And who doesn't know
the Matron of Ephesus's story?

420
00:45:34,512 --> 00:45:37,504
There once was a beautiful young woman...

421
00:45:37,581 --> 00:45:40,550
quite virtuous...
who suddenly was widowed.

422
00:46:01,038 --> 00:46:04,166
According to Greek custom,
the husband's body:

423
00:46:04,241 --> 00:46:06,266
was placed in the crypt:

424
00:46:06,343 --> 00:46:10,211
but the honest and loyal widow
wouldn't leave his side:

425
00:46:10,281 --> 00:46:12,806
Night and days he kept vigil and cried:

426
00:46:12,883 --> 00:46:15,010
and wanted to starve to death:

427
00:46:15,086 --> 00:46:16,417
Everyone left:

428
00:46:16,487 --> 00:46:18,819
only she remained there:

429
00:46:18,889 --> 00:46:20,948
Not far from the tomb:

430
00:46:21,025 --> 00:46:23,858
a thief sentenced to death
had been hanged:

431
00:46:24,295 --> 00:46:27,264
and a handsome soldier was keeping
guard over him:

432
00:46:51,689 --> 00:46:54,658
Why do you want to starve yourself
to death?

433
00:46:56,227 --> 00:46:58,525
What good would burying
yourself alive do?

434
00:46:59,029 --> 00:47:01,020
Drink something.

435
00:47:07,204 --> 00:47:09,229
Come on, drink.

436
00:47:20,584 --> 00:47:22,347
You must live...

437
00:47:22,419 --> 00:47:25,388
Enjoy the delights of life while you can.

438
00:47:25,689 --> 00:47:29,181
This very corpse here should
convince you of that.

439
00:47:30,294 --> 00:47:33,263
Be brave...drink...

440
00:48:30,654 --> 00:48:32,178
They've stolen the hanged man!

441
00:48:32,256 --> 00:48:36,317
While I was with you,
the thief's family took him away.

442
00:48:37,194 --> 00:48:39,526
I know what punishment I'll get...

443
00:48:39,597 --> 00:48:41,292
a horrible death.

444
00:48:41,365 --> 00:48:44,698
Why should I wait for it?
I'd rather die by my own hands.

445
00:48:45,402 --> 00:48:48,098
No, my dear...
To lose the two men in my life...

446
00:48:48,172 --> 00:48:50,834
one after the other, would be too much...

447
00:48:56,747 --> 00:48:59,443
Better to hang a dead husband...

448
00:48:59,516 --> 00:49:02,041
than to lose a living lover.

449
00:49:07,958 --> 00:49:10,256
"Better to hang a dead husband...

450
00:49:10,327 --> 00:49:12,625
than to lose a living lover."

451
00:49:23,874 --> 00:49:26,672
Poets may die, Encolpius.

452
00:49:26,744 --> 00:49:29,872
But it doesn't matter, if poetry remains.

453
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:37,048
My friend,
companion of my final moments here...

454
00:49:37,121 --> 00:49:38,782
You'll be able to say...

455
00:49:38,856 --> 00:49:42,815
"I knew Eumolpus, the poet."

456
00:49:44,928 --> 00:49:46,520
What can I say?

457
00:49:46,597 --> 00:49:52,536
If I were as rich as Trimalchio,
I'd leave you some land or a ship.

458
00:49:53,671 --> 00:49:57,437
But I can only leave you
what I had myself.

459
00:49:57,508 --> 00:50:01,205
I leave you poetry.
I leave you the seasons...

460
00:50:01,278 --> 00:50:05,476
especially spring and summer...

461
00:50:06,417 --> 00:50:09,716
I leave you the wind, the sun...

462
00:50:09,787 --> 00:50:13,723
I leave you the sea, the good sea...

463
00:50:13,791 --> 00:50:16,157
The earth is good, too...

464
00:50:17,061 --> 00:50:20,519
The mountains, streams, and rivers...

465
00:50:21,065 --> 00:50:23,829
And the big clouds that move by...

466
00:50:23,901 --> 00:50:26,699
solemn and light...

467
00:50:27,137 --> 00:50:28,934
You'll look at them...

468
00:50:29,006 --> 00:50:32,635
and maybe remember
our brief friendship...

469
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:35,008
And I leave you the trees...

470
00:50:35,312 --> 00:50:37,712
and their agile inhabitants...

471
00:50:37,915 --> 00:50:39,974
Love, tears, joy...

472
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:42,575
stars, Encolpius.

473
00:50:42,986 --> 00:50:46,080
I leave you sounds, songs, noises...

474
00:50:46,156 --> 00:50:50,820
The voice of man,
which is the most harmonious of music...

475
00:50:51,929 --> 00:50:54,193
I leave you...

476
00:51:10,914 --> 00:51:13,849
I still see you before my eyes, Giton...

477
00:51:13,917 --> 00:51:15,544
disgraceful weakness...

478
00:51:15,619 --> 00:51:18,713
I still love you,
even if you've abandoned me.

479
00:51:18,922 --> 00:51:20,787
Can't you say anything?

480
00:51:20,858 --> 00:51:23,850
You left me for another love.

481
00:51:23,927 --> 00:51:26,361
Did I deserve such an insult?

482
00:52:57,654 --> 00:52:59,417
My fellow prisoners informed me:

483
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:02,823
that we'd been captured
by the terrible Lichas of Tarantum:

484
00:53:03,393 --> 00:53:05,190
His friend Tryphaena and he:

485
00:53:05,262 --> 00:53:07,127
combed the seas looking
for precious objects:

486
00:53:07,197 --> 00:53:10,223
to give pleasure to Caesar's
lonely life on his island:

487
00:53:11,201 --> 00:53:13,669
We all were destined to serve
as the objects:

488
00:53:13,737 --> 00:53:18,470
of the cruel emperor's pastimes:

489
00:53:22,713 --> 00:53:24,977
So, here I am, unfortunate yet again:

490
00:53:25,649 --> 00:53:27,014
So close to:

491
00:53:27,084 --> 00:53:29,712
yet still separated from,
the boy I love so much:

492
00:53:29,786 --> 00:53:31,185
I like your tunic.

493
00:53:31,622 --> 00:53:33,055
Let me try it on.

494
00:53:33,123 --> 00:53:34,852
Give it to me...Give it to me.

495
00:57:04,701 --> 00:57:06,726
He's so beautiful...

496
00:57:06,803 --> 00:57:08,668
Spare him.

497
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:19,506
Oh, sweet beauty...come...close to me...

498
00:57:22,285 --> 00:57:25,083
come to me...yes, come...

499
00:57:52,983 --> 00:57:55,645
Your young body...

500
00:57:55,719 --> 00:57:58,586
oh, yes, so smooth.

501
00:58:12,302 --> 00:58:15,465
Oh, your eyes.

502
01:00:09,451 --> 01:00:12,511
All this treasure is bound for Caesar...

503
01:00:12,688 --> 01:00:15,816
but the most precious one is mine.

504
01:00:49,925 --> 01:00:54,259
The victim's blood color
brings us great joy.

505
01:00:54,330 --> 01:00:56,628
The gods are favorable to this union.

506
01:01:00,536 --> 01:01:03,369
Lichas, take your groom's hand.

507
01:01:06,642 --> 01:01:09,634
Remember, you must be faithful
to him forever.

508
01:01:09,712 --> 01:01:12,340
And you, groom...

509
01:01:12,414 --> 01:01:16,646
know that you must forget
your past taste for young boys.

510
01:01:16,719 --> 01:01:19,586
A husband takes no liberties.

511
01:01:19,655 --> 01:01:25,025
You must dedicate your entire self
to your bride forever.

512
01:01:25,461 --> 01:01:29,921
May complete harmony
and great happiness be yours.

513
01:01:29,999 --> 01:01:33,560
Venus favors marriages held at sea.

514
01:01:34,703 --> 01:01:36,466
Say the ritual words.

515
01:01:38,207 --> 01:01:40,266
Happiness!

516
01:01:44,713 --> 01:01:46,943
Happiness!

517
01:03:02,691 --> 01:03:05,660
And the gods appeared to him,
saying these words...

518
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:08,594
"If you want an equal fate...

519
01:03:08,664 --> 01:03:11,565
you'll live half your life underground...

520
01:03:11,633 --> 01:03:15,262
and half in heaven's golden dwellings."

521
01:04:02,351 --> 01:04:05,149
But our good fortune
didn't last for long:

522
01:04:05,888 --> 01:04:09,324
We were nearing the fateful
day of the June kalends:

523
01:04:10,125 --> 01:04:14,118
Off the coast of Taunia, the island
of Caesar's favorite residence:

524
01:04:14,196 --> 01:04:17,461
there appeared, one morning, armed ships:

525
01:05:19,561 --> 01:05:21,290
The tyrant is dead!

526
01:06:15,751 --> 01:06:18,345
This innocent young lamb
is going with us.

527
01:06:22,958 --> 01:06:24,949
What's going on here?

528
01:06:25,327 --> 01:06:27,557
This ship isn't yours anymore, Lichas.

529
01:06:28,297 --> 01:06:31,733
Caesar is dead.
The new Caesar is on his way.

530
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:35,668
We drowned your emperor like a pig.

531
01:06:40,976 --> 01:06:43,035
Treacherous dogs!
