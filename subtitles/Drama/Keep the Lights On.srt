1
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,104
Hello?

2
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,984
Hey, what's up?

3
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:38,240
Five feet eleven,
good looking, masculine.

4
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:43,620
Yeah, work out, in good shape.

5
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:49,585
Six and a half, thick, uncut.

6
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:50,669
Fuck.

7
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:58,260
Hello.

8
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:01,513
Hey what's up?

9
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,222
East Village.

10
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:07,102
No, I'm more of a top.
What about you?

11
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:10,355
All right, too bad.

12
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:18,238
Hello? Hello?

13
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,636
You looking to hook up?

14
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:45,307
Yeah, me too. Tonight.

15
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:49,019
Yeah. I'm a top.

16
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,234
You into that?

17
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:01,573
No, I'm looking to travel.

18
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,620
Where in Chelsea are you?

19
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,436
Who is it?

20
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,437
It's Jeff.

21
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:33,517
I left my phone number on
a piece of paper.

22
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,812
Cool. Thanks for coming by.

23
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,898
Thanks for having me.

24
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:53,495
I have a girlfriend,
by the way, so...

25
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,914
Don't get your hopes up.

26
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,168
That's too bad.

27
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,511
My guest, is Erik Rothman,
whose new film

28
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:12,514
Outside of Lafayette,
will have its

29
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,392
world premiere at the Rotterdam
Film Festival next week.

30
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,979
And it will open here, at the
Quad in New York on the 23rd.

31
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,523
So Erik, are you working on
something new now?

32
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:24,609
I've been working on something
for the last year.

33
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:27,946
It's a film about a filmmaker
and a photographer named

34
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:33,452
Avery Willard who was a New York
theater and advertising

35
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:37,664
photographer in the 40's and
50's, but who also used

36
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:41,793
his studio to photograph male
nudes and physique spreads,

37
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,420
and female impersonators.

38
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:45,422
So how come I've never
heard of this guy?

39
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:49,384
Because no one has, really.
His work is like a visual

40
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,928
anthropology of gay life
New York from

41
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:55,140
the 40's 'til the 90's.

42
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:58,185
Right now, you know I'm
still in the beginning,

43
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,188
I'm calling the film
In Search of Avery Willard.

44
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:07,319
And I'm just kind of in the
beginning of it all, still.

45
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,621
Hello? What's up?

46
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:47,961
Five feet eleven,
blonde, good looking.

47
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,045
Masculine.

48
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:52,465
You like?

49
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,092
Yeah, I like.

50
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:59,598
Good, cool.
Make yourself comfortable.

51
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,309
I'm going to, if that's okay.

52
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,272
You don't worry about your
neighbors at all?

53
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:09,232
I like it. You don't like it?

54
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,442
I like it.

55
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:15,363
Get comfortable. Dude, come on.

56
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:22,871
All right, that's better.
I like guys like you.

57
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:23,747
Yeah?

58
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,790
I like masculine guys.

59
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,717
This okay?

60
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:41,014
Yeah.
Why don't you come over here?

61
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,934
Hold on, guy. Hold on.

62
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,436
You like my body?

63
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:47,729
Yeah, I do.

64
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:50,732
I used to be a dancer, you know.

65
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,651
Oh yeah? I want to touch you.

66
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:56,529
Let's get used to each other
first, if that's okay.

67
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:03,828
My boyfriend gets off
work around six,

68
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,997
he'll be home by six-thirty.

69
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:10,085
OK well, we got some time
then don't we.

70
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,753
What's your name?

71
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:15,757
Russ. What's yours?

72
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:16,633
Dave.

73
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,445
He's the best poet I've
read in a long time,

74
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:38,697
you should take it home.

75
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:42,200
Someone actually recommended it
to me a long time ago but I,

76
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,411
I couldn't get through it.

77
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,704
Why?

78
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,749
I was still with my ex-boyfriend
Paolo, who was really sick.

79
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,876
He was positive.

80
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:55,547
I think it was just hard for me
to read about AIDS back then.

81
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,757
Is he still alive?

82
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:02,971
Yeah - he's in London,
he lives there.

83
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:06,307
He went there to work and
I broke up with him

84
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,809
over the phone.

85
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:08,852
Classy.

86
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,983
In truth I think I didn't
love him enough.

87
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:28,788
Have you seen my belt, anywhere?
Because I can't find my belt.

88
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,585
Are you leaving?

89
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:38,006
Yeah?
No.

90
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:50,810
I should go and... I should go.

91
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:54,397
But I can't find my belt and I
can't leave without my belt.

92
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:11,122
So? So what's he like?

93
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:15,794
He's like...
he's just like nice.

94
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,630
Nice!

95
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:19,798
Yes, he's very nice.

96
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,300
Where's he from?

97
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:26,888
He's from the suburbs of Boston.
He's a lawyer at Random House.

98
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:28,848
You know he'd be the
first American -

99
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:29,891
American boyfriend
I've ever had?

100
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:34,187
I haven't seen you this excited
about anyone in a long time,

101
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,023
since Paolo.

102
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,109
I was not that excited
about Paolo, Claire.

103
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,945
I don't know why you keep
saying that all the time.

104
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,363
You guys were a good couple.

105
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,865
No, we were not a good couple
because he bugged me.

106
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:50,161
He was never interested in
anything I had to say.

107
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:53,414
So now, you've found a pupil?

108
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,917
That's not what I'm saying.

109
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,710
Paul - he is curious,
he's excited.

110
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:05,837
He's... yeah he's a nice guy.
And he seems to really like me.

111
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,556
I'm glad.

112
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,474
I don't know.

113
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,442
This is my little secret,
you can't tell anyone.

114
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:22,902
I won't.

115
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,153
Do you swear?

116
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,489
I swear.

117
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:31,703
Because people in the publishing
business like to gossip.

118
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,831
People love to gossip
in any business.

119
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,833
Especially in publishing.

120
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,585
Paul, I swear.

121
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,111
I just don't want anyone...
to know.

122
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,415
Open your mouth.

123
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,636
Take your shirt off.

124
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,916
Had you had sex with any other
men before you met me?

125
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:06,631
A few.
Not as many as you, I'm sure.

126
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:09,300
I was a late bloomer.

127
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:13,805
I was thirteen when I had sex
with a guy for the first time.

128
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:14,889
Yeah?

129
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,944
What are you doing?

130
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,112
It looks better that way.

131
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,156
I don't think so.

132
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:17,910
You're too cool.

133
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,996
Oh yeah?

134
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,998
Like New Yorkers don't wear
their collars up?

135
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,541
No.

136
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,586
Same way we don't say
"ciao" instead of bye.

137
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,589
What's wrong with "ciao?"

138
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,507
It sounds pretentious.

139
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:38,097
I didn't say "ciao" to Markus,
actually I said "tschuss."

140
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,141
Same difference.

141
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,185
He's German!

142
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,855
It's okay. You have an accent.

143
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,107
You can get away with it.
I don't think I could.

144
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,777
Thank you.

145
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,742
It's beautiful.

146
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,620
It's a picture of a woman
missing the subway.

147
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,790
When I first moved to New York
I wanted to buy one,

148
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,750
but it was like $1500.

149
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,753
But I really wanted it so I
asked my father if he'd,

150
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,380
you know, lend me the
money to get one.

151
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,801
When he heard the price he
thought it was ridiculous.

152
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:18,429
Now that blonde girl
is worth $5000.

153
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,139
Oh my God, it's Katie.

154
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,182
Who?

155
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,683
Katie.

156
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,015
Well maybe it's time for you
to introduce your boyfriend

157
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,983
to your ex girlfriend.

158
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:48,209
And would periodically
check his statistics.

159
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:53,381
It was almost like a laptop and
he enjoyed checking himself

160
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,842
almost recreationally.

161
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,760
There's a long line
at the bathroom.

162
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,054
I flirt with the
good looking boy.

163
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:04,559
Can't tell if gay or straight.
Has a foreign accent.

164
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,103
I tell him an idea I have
for a video project.

165
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,691
Coward!

166
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,342
Erik...

167
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:45,141
I think we should have
a baby together.

168
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,110
Where did that come from?

169
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,112
I'm thirty-four.

170
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,864
I know.

171
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,282
I'm just saying, in a few years,
if I haven't found

172
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:04,076
the right guy...

173
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,206
I don't know what
Paul would think.

174
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:11,125
I don't care what
Paul would think.

175
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:16,172
I do. I like him.

176
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:19,967
We're talking about
moving in together.

177
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:26,599
What? I... I like him.

178
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,616
Yes, is Dorothy there?

179
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,368
I'll put Dorothy on the line.

180
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:46,202
Thank you.

181
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:52,333
Hello?

182
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:53,334
Dorothy!

183
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,919
Hi Erik, listen.
We cannot tell you

184
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:57,046
the results of your HIV test
over the phone.

185
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:59,006
It's a legal matter.

186
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,758
We would be breaking state
confidentiality rules.

187
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,760
Are you telling me that
I'm HIV positive?

188
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:04,637
No, I'm not telling you that.

189
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,266
Are you lying to me?

190
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:12,144
What I want to know is why
you're so nervous.

191
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,146
Do you know you're supposed to
wear condoms whenever

192
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,982
you have sex, oral or anal?

193
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,692
Of course, I know that.

194
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,361
I'm upset because I think you're
telling me I'm HIV positive.

195
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:21,320
Wouldn't you be?

196
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,699
When are you coming
back to New York?

197
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,785
I won't be back in New York for
weeks, maybe months.

198
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:31,372
I'm in Virginia, I'm doing
interviews for a documentary.

199
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:34,375
Just come into the office
when you're back.

200
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,210
Do you know my test results?

201
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,587
Yes, I do.

202
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,007
Well can you tell me
what they are?

203
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,426
Please? Please?

204
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,885
Listen to me.

205
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,430
What am I saying to you
between the lines?

206
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:51,309
That I'm HIV positive.

207
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,728
What is the opposite of that?

208
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,604
That I'm negative?

209
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,231
Right.

210
00:21:57,357 --> 00:22:03,571
Oh fuck, thank you, thank you.
Thank you.

211
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,281
I'll come and see you when
I'm back in New York.

212
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:08,159
Skip it Erik, have a good day.

213
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:12,288
Thank you, you too.
Have a great day.

214
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,874
Thank you Dorothy! Thank you.

215
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:31,640
This is such a wonderful
thing that you're doing

216
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:32,683
for my brother.

217
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,810
It's just, thank you so much.

218
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:38,898
Well, your brother is a
wonderful part of my life.

219
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,442
This is nothing,
it's my pleasure.

220
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:44,153
Thank you, Luis. He's here.

221
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,946
Okay. Okay!

222
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,783
Everyone get in your hiding
places he's coming up.

223
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,160
Now! Go, go.

224
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:53,412
Get in your places
and quiet down.

225
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:08,386
Surprise! Happy birthday!

226
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:15,226
Oh my god, I said I never
wanted a surprise party!

227
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,533
Oh I hate you.

228
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,833
Happy birthday.

229
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,592
No!

230
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,427
Maybe that's what you
really want.

231
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:14,595
No!

232
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:16,388
Just 'cause I'm talking to
some guy in the street.

233
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:19,099
It doesn't mean
I want to be single.

234
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,643
It's really not fair.

235
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:25,314
Come here. Oh, come on.

236
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:33,989
Where are you going?
I said I was sorry.

237
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,909
It doesn't sound like
you're sorry.

238
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:39,537
You might say so, but you're
not acting that way.

239
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:40,746
You know what?

240
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,873
I'm not the one who wants to
do drugs all the time.

241
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,750
Do not try to turn this
around on me.

242
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:45,501
I'm not trying to turn it
around on you,

243
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,461
I'm just trying to talk about
your drug use.

244
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,964
My drug use?!

245
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:53,175
Why is it not okay for me to
bring that up?

246
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,469
Will you let me go to sleep?
Please?

247
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,513
I have to get up early, Erik.
Some of us have jobs, you know.

248
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,390
Ughhh.

249
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:00,140
Don't do that.

250
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,225
Ughhh.

251
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,511
Do not make sounds like that.

252
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:08,065
Erik! Erik!
Stop it and go to bed!

253
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:10,276
We can talk about it tomorrow.

254
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,196
I can't go to sleep like this.

255
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:15,364
Yes you can.

256
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,366
No, I can't go to sleep when
you're like this.

257
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:18,534
When I'm like what?

258
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,618
When you're like this.

259
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:20,984
Well what do you want me to do?

260
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:21,662
I want you to come
to bed with me.

261
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:22,538
Why?

262
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:23,497
Because.

263
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:26,458
Why can't we just sleep in
different rooms?

264
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,460
It's fine.
It'll be good for us.

265
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,589
Because I don't want to.

266
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,549
You are such a baby.

267
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,305
What are you doing?

268
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,640
Come on, you don't need this.
You don't need it!

269
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:42,725
Erik!

270
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,560
No, you're gonna come sleep
with me in the bed.

271
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:44,852
No I'm not.

272
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,729
Now! Yes you are.

273
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:47,688
No I am not.

274
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,694
Yes you are gonna come sleep
with me in the bed!

275
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,199
Stop it!

276
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,499
Why don't you just call
that boy from the street

277
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,835
and have him save you?

278
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,920
He didn't give me his number.

279
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,006
I hate you so much!

280
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,096
I met Avery Willard
through Jack Smith -

281
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,891
if Jack Smith was doing some
sort of ridiculous filming

282
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:25,643
he would be there, and then he
would tell you about it,

283
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,354
and he'd say,
"Oh, you're a filmmaker,

284
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,730
you've got to meet this one."

285
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:33,150
He was always putting
together these underground

286
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:35,653
kind of like talents, you know.

287
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,946
I don't know what you call
that kind of group of

288
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:41,950
people because we weren't
the Spielbergs of the time.

289
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,328
And I don't even know if
there is anything like -

290
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,872
oh yes, there is - that stuff
that's on the Internet now,

291
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,917
is exactly what Avery
Willard was and we all were.

292
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,670
We weren't making great stuff,
you know it's -

293
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:55,297
but we were filming things that
no one else would film,

294
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:56,965
maybe that's what it
was all about.

295
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,467
Do you think he had talent -

296
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:00,761
Avery Willard.
Do you think he had talent?

297
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:03,055
No, I don't think
he had talent one.

298
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,984
I think that's why he
was angry all the time.

299
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:10,562
Because he not only was
not very attractive -

300
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:14,733
actually I think his
outsides were -

301
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,985
because of what he was inside.

302
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,446
You know, that happens
to people, you know.

303
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:20,656
I mean, check out Nixon.

304
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:24,493
You know, that face
goes with who's inside.

305
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:27,121
And that's very - I really
believe you can tell who

306
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,289
people are - what they're
somewhat about -

307
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,541
by their appearance.

308
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:33,127
You, for instance,
have a wonderful open,

309
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:35,212
and welcoming kind
of thing about you.

310
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,063
Hi it's Paul,
leave me a message.

311
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:01,697
So, guess who we ran
into yesterday?

312
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,490
Who?

313
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,534
Your ex-boyfriend.

314
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,828
Erik, if you saw Paolo now,
you wouldn't believe it.

315
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:11,749
He's working out and everything.
He looks great.

316
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,751
If you're gonna start
with that again

317
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,461
I'm gonna get very
angry with you.

318
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,188
I'm gonna call him and see
if he wants to

319
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,215
come to the gym with me.

320
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,739
Don't worry he doesn't want you
anyway, he's got a boyfriend,

321
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,239
and they're moving
together to Brazil.

322
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,138
Is that true?

323
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,265
What? That he has a boyfriend?

324
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:30,350
That he's moving to Brazil.

325
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:33,353
That's what he told me.

326
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,898
Well that's just incredible,
I mean he was,

327
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,525
he always had this fantasy
that he was gonna

328
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:41,945
live on some island in the
north of Brazil.

329
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,697
I guess it's not a
fantasy anymore.

330
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:47,826
Where the hell is Paul?

331
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,788
Yeah, where is he?

332
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:53,499
He went to get some cash.

333
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,209
I know, but it's been
twenty minutes.

334
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,669
More, it's like thirty minutes.

335
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:01,048
I got this.

336
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:01,840
Thank you, Dan.

337
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,926
Are you sure?

338
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,803
Yes, I'm sure.

339
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,305
Thank you.

340
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:11,433
Just run to the bathroom
and I'll be right back.

341
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,653
I just got a call from Paul.

342
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,340
What happened?
Was it something we said?

343
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:25,280
No!

344
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:28,867
No, I think it was the mix of
wine with vodka,

345
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:29,873
he's not feeling well.

346
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,287
He went home.

347
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:35,541
He sends his apologies
but he's in bed.

348
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:39,002
Okay, well - we're gonna go.

349
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,629
Which way you headed?

350
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:41,839
I think I'm,
I'm just gonna walk.

351
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:45,509
I'll take a cab with you guys.

352
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:45,926
Bye.

353
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:47,636
You alright?

354
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:48,762
Yeah.

355
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:49,721
Well, always good
to see you man.

356
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:53,225
You too man, good night!

357
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,981
- Bye!
- Bye!

358
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,709
Paul.

359
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,335
Hello.

360
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:29,052
It's Monday morning.
Where have you been?

361
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:32,514
Not now.
I don't want to be late.

362
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,714
Paul?

363
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:24,232
They were very important for
the gay community and

364
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,943
he was an institution.

365
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:28,153
And everybody walked
out on him.

366
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,989
It all just slowly fell apart.

367
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,747
Avery was so bizarre,
I thought.

368
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:41,124
And also, I saw so
many things in Avery

369
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,377
I didn't like about myself.

370
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,190
Hello?

371
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:54,948
Hey what's up?
East Village, you?

372
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:58,160
It's eight-and-a-half inch.

373
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:02,748
Hard as a rock,
I got a beautiful cock.

374
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,207
Yeah you like that?

375
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,087
No, no, I can't host.

376
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:14,801
I'm married. Yeah.
No, my wife's not home.

377
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:16,762
She's gonna come
back home later.

378
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,890
What I wanna do,
I just fuck your mouth

379
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,017
like I fuck her pussy.

380
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:25,979
You little bitch, come here
I want to fuck you.

381
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,069
Hello?

382
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:35,989
Hello? Hey what's up?

383
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:44,115
East Village. You?
Yeah, I'm a dominant top.

384
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,918
What are you into?

385
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:51,254
Where you from?

386
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:59,930
Paul? Is that you?

387
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,723
Paul?

388
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,015
Hi this is Paul,
leave me a message.

389
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:48,687
Paul this is killing me, it's
killing me, it's killing me!

390
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:11,543
What I want to know is what you
were doing on a phone sex line

391
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:12,919
when you were supposed
to be editing!

392
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:14,754
You were gone for two days.
I could not find you.

393
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,423
So you were looking for me?
Is that what you were doing?

394
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:17,591
Of course not.

395
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:20,237
Erik, I don't spy on you, and I
will not stand being spied upon.

396
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:22,262
If every time you go away we
have to go through this,

397
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:24,723
then I don't want to be in
this relationship anymore.

398
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:26,057
I have no idea where you are,

399
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,517
I have no idea what
you're doing.

400
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,186
Why are you focusing on me?

401
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:32,147
You've been working on this
goddamn movie for four years.

402
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,193
You get a chance to go away
to an artist's colony

403
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,276
where they bring you your lunch
in a fucking picnic basket,

404
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:38,322
and you spend the whole time
on a phone sex line.

405
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,155
I did not spend the whole
time on a phone sex line!

406
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,362
I don't have time for this!

407
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:43,283
I have a job, do you understand
what that is?

408
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,952
I was at my desk, at work,
early, on Monday.

409
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:47,829
I do my job. I have my clients.

410
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:49,080
Do you know what my
work load is?

411
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,248
Do you have any idea?

412
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,333
Stop! Stop it!

413
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:17,359
What? Oh, sorry, sorry.

414
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,512
Have you seen this?

415
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,014
Seen what?

416
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:35,687
The floor is buckling over here.
It's pretty bad over here too.

417
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,106
Was it always like that?

418
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,550
You should ask Mario if he can
find someone to fix it for you.

419
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:49,367
You know, you have to tell
me what you do when

420
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:50,410
you're out all night and
I can't find you.

421
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,329
Don't start with that.

422
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:01,629
Erik?

423
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:08,928
Erik? What are you doing?
Erik stop it! Stop it.

424
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:34,454
There were certain young men
who were sort of on the scene,

425
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,414
and hanging out on the
streets and so forth,

426
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,416
that Avery had seen
me with and...

427
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:42,879
Why is it so gray?

428
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,466
Can you stop.

429
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:47,425
We'll fix it later, Erik.

430
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:50,595
We really shouldn't stop now,
we're already behind.

431
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,931
If we aren't going to do it now,
why am I here?

432
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,808
Can we just watch it
going forward and

433
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,434
we'll fix that bit later.

434
00:39:58,646 --> 00:39:59,270
OK, fine.

435
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,398
John, thank you.

436
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:19,082
Paul, Paul.

437
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,388
Alright, Paul.

438
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:40,311
I love you, very much,
and you are my best friend.

439
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:44,983
I admire you, and I think
you're brilliant.

440
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:50,196
You are sweet and kind
and very loving.

441
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:56,494
Since we first
started going out,

442
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:01,875
alcohol and drug use have been
a problem in our relationship.

443
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:04,878
I have never felt certain that
you would come home any night

444
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,921
that we've not been together
for an evening,

445
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:09,466
that's for over five years.

446
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:12,719
Every New Year's you made
a resolution to stop.

447
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:14,929
But it never happens, Paul.

448
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:19,142
After all of this, you are still
my favorite person in the world.

449
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,394
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you and

450
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,314
I want our relationship
to make me feel stronger.

451
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:32,614
I can't take care of you
because you have proven

452
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:37,327
to be helpless and unmanageable.

453
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:41,539
I've worried about you
every hour of every day.

454
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,458
I can't live like this.

455
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:49,339
If you don't get on a plane
and follow through

456
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:51,508
with the recommendations,

457
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:56,179
our relationship is over
and you need to move out.

458
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,606
Are you finished?

459
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,531
You all finished?

460
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,959
Jill is ready.

461
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,627
Thanks.

462
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,343
These are the files
that I found at home.

463
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:42,183
Thanks. Oh this is it.

464
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:46,854
Paul also had some messages.
Peggy Simon...

465
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,606
All right, let me get this down.

466
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:53,611
So, Peggy Simon,
Lucius Ambrosino,

467
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:56,990
and Gene Reid-Pharr.

468
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,700
So I'm just telling
everybody that

469
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,827
Paul's taking some time off.

470
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:04,455
If they ask, I tell his
writers it's stress

471
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,457
and he's taking care of himself.

472
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,543
Thanks Jill.

473
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:14,090
I feel terrible that your life
has been so impinged by this.

474
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:15,466
It's okay.

475
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:19,262
Oh, here.

476
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:21,264
This is Paul's mail.

477
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:23,224
I went through most
of it already.

478
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:26,144
I think there's a check in
there, somewhere.

479
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,151
He called last night.

480
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:34,986
And?

481
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:42,493
He... he said that I
ruined his life,

482
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,746
and that he wasn't
going to stay.

483
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:52,045
Well, I think they all say
that in rehab, Erik.

484
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:58,551
I hope so.

485
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:05,516
Dear friends, I wanted
to write you,

486
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:09,437
and tell you that I'm
back from Minnesota,

487
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:13,399
and that I can report that Paul
is doing very, very well.

488
00:44:13,525 --> 00:44:14,984
He looks great.

489
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,612
He has certainly taken to
the program, to the steps.

490
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:22,575
I'm proud of him for taking
rehab so seriously.

491
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:28,122
So he is coming back soon,
and the next phase will begin.

492
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:30,667
I'm nervous, I'll admit.

493
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:32,752
And I know now that I need to
separate myself from his

494
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:36,255
recovery as best as I can.

495
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:39,550
So I will rely on each
one of you to remind me.

496
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,136
That's all for now.

497
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:43,638
Lots of love, Erik.

498
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:17,714
I'm lgor.

499
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:23,678
I'm Erik. Hello, lgor.

500
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,687
No, not here.

501
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:33,646
Yes.

502
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:34,647
Let's go some place.

503
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:37,024
No, I don't want to.

504
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:41,112
We can go to my place,
but I live in Brooklyn.

505
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:49,704
Shit, is he okay?

506
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,165
Did you guys do "G?"

507
00:45:58,046 --> 00:45:58,838
Take this.

508
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:07,346
God it's gross down here.

509
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,560
Thank you.

510
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:15,062
I guess it would be completely
inappropriate to invite you

511
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,981
to my house now wouldn't it?

512
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:19,025
I think so.

513
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:22,693
Because I have a boyfriend?

514
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:27,617
No, I... I remembered I have
a class in the morning.

515
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:30,787
What do you study?

516
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:31,829
It's a drawing class.

517
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:34,499
You're an artist?

518
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,793
I paint so I guess
I'm an artist.

519
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:40,797
I bet you're very good at
what you're doing.

520
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,258
And you?

521
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:46,219
What do you do?

522
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:48,513
I make documentary films.

523
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:49,722
Nice.

524
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:55,728
Are you sure you don't
want to come over?

525
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:57,522
Just for a little bit.

526
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,232
Yes.

527
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:00,858
No, I'm, I'm sure.

528
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,860
But my subway is this way.

529
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,779
I can walk with you
a little more.

530
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:07,782
Igor.

531
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:11,494
Where in Russia are you from?

532
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,955
I'm from Ecuador actually.

533
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:16,624
My father was a hard core
Marxist and

534
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:19,585
he named all of his kids
after Russian names.

535
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:22,004
My sisters are Tatiana
and Tamara.

536
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:24,841
And lgor ended up living
in New York City.

537
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:27,802
In Coney Island, of all places,
surrounded by Russians.

538
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:13,598
Oh my god. Are you okay?

539
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:20,146
It's wonderful!

540
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,282
You're coming in, right?

541
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,868
Oh yeah. I come later.

542
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:43,252
Are you coming in?

543
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:46,255
I'll join you in a second.

544
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,969
When are you two
getting pregnant?

545
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:53,721
We aren't.

546
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:55,431
Why not?

547
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:59,518
He already has two kids,
and he doesn't really want

548
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,479
to have another one.

549
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:04,607
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

550
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:07,818
Yeah, me too.

551
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:13,824
He's not perfect but,
I do like him.

552
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:23,876
I wish I could trust you more.

553
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:26,671
Excuse me?

554
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,465
It really upsets me that I had
to learn about how bad things

555
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:32,134
were between you and
Paul only at the end.

556
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:35,054
I'm mad at you for
not telling me.

557
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,931
I've been hiding crucial
events in my life

558
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:40,893
since I was thirteen years old.

559
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:45,314
That's no excuse.
You need to change things.

560
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,691
Get better therapy.

561
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,902
I'm trying.
I'm telling you now.

562
00:49:50,028 --> 00:49:51,946
Well, I appreciate it.

563
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,948
But I still don't forgive
you for keeping me

564
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:56,617
in the dark for so long, ok?

565
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:58,536
I need you to be
braver than that.

566
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:01,080
If I'm gonna be the
father of your child?

567
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:02,081
Yes.

568
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:05,501
If you're gonna be the
father of my child.

569
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:53,174
I just want to say...

570
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:58,220
Claire! Alassane!

571
00:50:58,346 --> 00:51:01,057
Jesus Christ, those two.
Get a room!

572
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:03,017
I want to say thank you
for coming!

573
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:08,189
I want to say thank you for
coming, both of you.

574
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:10,691
Thank you for driving during
the snow storm,

575
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:14,612
and Thomas, Vivian, Luca -
thank you very much.

576
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,655
Thank you very much for
ditching your mom's

577
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:17,948
fabulous cousin's party.

578
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:20,076
Thank you for giving
us a reason.

579
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:24,705
Dan, thank you so much for
agreeing to sleep on the couch.

580
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:25,956
Oh, really?

581
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,113
Alright, I'll sleep
on the couch.

582
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:32,505
No really, seriously,
I really want to

583
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:34,590
I really want to thank
you all for being here.

584
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:36,634
It means a lot to me,
that you're here,

585
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,719
and we're spending
the holiday together.

586
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:40,179
It means so much.

587
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:46,644
And I'm especially happy to
have Paul here with us.

588
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,521
Looking so gorgeous...

589
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:55,903
Why thank you, Luca.

590
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:05,746
It has not been an easy few
months, Paul, but

591
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,500
Erik...

592
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:17,216
I think you are a wonder, and
your energy and your positivity,

593
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:23,180
and the way you're bravely
changing your life -

594
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:27,893
it's just amazing to watch.

595
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:31,981
And to be part of.

596
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:34,233
You inspire me and I love you.

597
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:36,026
Thank you.

598
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,988
Merry Christmas.

599
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:41,699
All right, cheers everyone.
That's it.

600
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:06,599
What is that?

601
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:11,437
I wonder who put that there.

602
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,127
Oh no, you didn't.

603
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:42,635
Merry Christmas.

604
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:47,223
Thank you.

605
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:53,854
For your love.
And your patience.

606
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:56,398
And thank you for
putting up with me.

607
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,326
It's amazing.

608
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:08,494
Do you like it?

609
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:12,289
Nah, I love it.

610
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:06,969
Paul? Paul pick up the phone.

611
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:10,806
We just won a Teddy Award -
best documentary.

612
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:16,145
Paul are you there?

613
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:21,942
OK, call me back as soon
as you get this.

614
00:55:22,068 --> 00:55:23,610
I love you.

615
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:06,362
Paul? Paul pick up the phone.

616
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:09,365
We just won a Teddy Award -
best documentary.

617
00:56:11,993 --> 00:56:14,411
Paul are you there?

618
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:20,542
OK, call me back as soon
as you get this.

619
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:22,336
I love you.

620
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,374
Hi Paul. I wanna talk to you!

621
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:29,009
I've been trying you for days,
I'm starting to get worried.

622
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:31,720
Call me back when you get this,
hope all is well, it's Vivian.

623
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:33,764
OK, bye.

624
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:36,392
Erik? This is Jill.

625
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:40,813
Paul has not showed up
in the office all week

626
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,606
and he's not returning
my calls.

627
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:44,483
I need to know what's going on.

628
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:48,821
So please call me -
212-249-3576.

629
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:49,571
Thanks.

630
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:55,828
Why don't you try calling
the police?

631
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:57,496
Oh the police can't do anything.

632
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:59,423
There are only two ways
Paul is going to stop.

633
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:01,750
He's going to run out of money,
or he's going to die.

634
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:04,044
Hey, don't say that.

635
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:06,130
Why do you think it's your
job to save him?

636
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,132
Dan! Stop it.

637
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:10,843
We don't need your Twelve Step
bullshit right now, okay?

638
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,889
If your boyfriend was on a
three week drug binge,

639
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:14,532
don't tell me you wouldn't
do everything

640
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:15,514
you could to find him.

641
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,348
- Right?
- No, I wouldn't.

642
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:17,307
Please.

643
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:18,392
I'm thinking of hiring
a private detective.

644
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:21,311
I'm sorry -
I can't sign up for this.

645
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:23,522
Call me when you guys get sane.

646
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:26,024
Erik, I love you.
I'm here for you.

647
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:28,360
But I can't support this
ridiculous type of behavior.

648
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:31,155
It didn't work the first time
and it's not going to work now.

649
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:31,447
Sorry, I'm late.

650
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:34,074
Paul's a grown up.

651
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,534
He's going to work it out,
or he's not.

652
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:36,994
But you're not going
to save him.

653
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,204
You never were,
and you aren't now.

654
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:40,998
What's going on?

655
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,666
Very helpful, Dan.

656
00:59:56,175 --> 01:00:00,262
Hi. Where are you?

657
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:06,226
Don't - don't go anywhere.
Stay where you are.

658
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:17,404
I love you.

659
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:25,787
Let's go home.

660
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:27,748
Don't start, Erik.

661
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:38,050
Can you believe this place?
Isn't it incredible?

662
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:40,886
It's a hotel room, Paul.

663
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:44,348
Don't be mean or I'm not going
to let you stay here.

664
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:51,772
Oh please don't do that.

665
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:57,527
Must've been expensive.

666
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:59,655
I got lucky.

667
01:01:02,116 --> 01:01:04,493
There's a middle of
the week deal.

668
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:06,745
Fashion week is over and
everyone went back to Milan.

669
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:09,790
There's also this art
thing in London.

670
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:12,209
What are you talking about?

671
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:16,588
Froze? No, Frieze?
The art thing?

672
01:01:16,714 --> 01:01:17,714
Do you want a drink?

673
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:27,599
Shit, I'm all out of ice.
Do you mind getting us some ice?

674
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:32,187
We got lots of ice at home.
Come on.

675
01:01:32,313 --> 01:01:34,940
What did I tell you?

676
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:39,236
Come see the bedroom.
I'll show you.

677
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:43,323
Try the bed. Oh, it's amazing.

678
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:45,033
I love this bed.

679
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:49,871
Paul...

680
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:08,765
I'm sorry I ruined your
premiere in Berlin.

681
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:14,855
I was really proud of you.

682
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:21,820
Come on, come on, let's go home.
Let's go home.

683
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,743
Please don't hate me.

684
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:45,302
Do you think I've lost weight?
I know I lost a little.

685
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:53,602
It's the crackhead diet.
I don't recommend it.

686
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:55,479
Let's go home.

687
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:01,485
I'll come home tomorrow.
You should leave now.

688
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:04,362
I'm not leaving.

689
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:08,241
You don't want to watch this.

690
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:10,702
I'm fine.

691
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:15,207
Erik, you should go.

692
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:16,792
I said I'm fine.

693
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:24,633
You're no worse than
anybody else.

694
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:27,010
I'm sure that there's
someone down the hall

695
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:29,721
doing exactly the same thing.

696
01:03:29,847 --> 01:03:31,598
Really?

697
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:32,808
Yeah.

698
01:03:57,750 --> 01:04:00,001
Paul, I know that you're ready.

699
01:04:00,127 --> 01:04:02,045
You're ready for
this to be over.

700
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:03,922
How do you know that?

701
01:04:04,048 --> 01:04:10,846
Because I know you, Paul.
I know you.

702
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:15,267
I'll come home tomorrow,
but you should go now.

703
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:20,397
You're gonna come home tomorrow,
and you're going to go to rehab.

704
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:21,648
I said I'm coming home tomorrow.

705
01:04:21,774 --> 01:04:22,732
I did not say I'm
going to rehab.

706
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:25,861
Do you promise?

707
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:27,320
Promise.

708
01:04:28,906 --> 01:04:32,576
Who is that?

709
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:37,038
It's your choice.
That's all you're gonna get.

710
01:04:37,164 --> 01:04:38,665
I think you should just leave.

711
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:39,875
Paul!

712
01:04:52,763 --> 01:04:54,472
You want anything?

713
01:04:56,475 --> 01:04:58,351
Yeah I'll have a beer.

714
01:04:58,477 --> 01:04:58,977
OK.

715
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:22,584
You ok?

716
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:24,127
I'm fine.

717
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:19,766
Erik? Erik?

718
01:06:19,892 --> 01:06:21,059
What?

719
01:07:27,918 --> 01:07:29,252
I'm glad you called.

720
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:31,588
I didn't expect to
see you again.

721
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:35,592
I'm on a little vacation.

722
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:40,138
I was working in Boca for
the last six months.

723
01:07:40,264 --> 01:07:45,018
And now I'm back,
and I'm not sure

724
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:48,313
what I'm gonna do next,
you know?

725
01:07:56,072 --> 01:08:01,785
Come on baby, come on.
That's it.

726
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,620
There you go.

727
01:08:22,389 --> 01:08:24,516
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

728
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:47,205
You look so serious.
You make me feel a little weird.

729
01:08:47,331 --> 01:08:49,582
Do other people say that to you?

730
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:52,001
You know, I got a degree
in English.

731
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:54,796
I'm not some stupid faggot.

732
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:01,970
Hold the lighter underneath,
you gotta get more smoke, man.

733
01:09:06,267 --> 01:09:07,225
That's it, hold it.

734
01:09:07,351 --> 01:09:11,062
That's it, let it go, let it go,
let it go, let it go.

735
01:09:11,188 --> 01:09:13,356
Easy, easy, yeah.

736
01:09:19,113 --> 01:09:20,321
You like that?

737
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:37,839
Yeah, that feels good.

738
01:09:37,965 --> 01:09:39,257
Feels really good.

739
01:09:41,218 --> 01:09:45,180
And you, you have a very
nice body, Russ.

740
01:09:45,306 --> 01:09:46,806
I like to show off my body.

741
01:09:46,932 --> 01:09:47,473
You do?

742
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:48,266
Yeah.

743
01:09:48,392 --> 01:09:50,185
That's very good.

744
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:58,151
You want something to drink?

745
01:09:58,277 --> 01:10:00,778
Yeah just some water please.

746
01:10:00,905 --> 01:10:03,615
Juice, how about juice -
I got orange juice.

747
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:06,367
Sounds perfect.

748
01:10:28,682 --> 01:10:29,515
You okay out there?

749
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:30,308
Yeah I'm fine.

750
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:40,777
What're you doing?

751
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:42,403
I just think I'm gonna leave.

752
01:10:42,529 --> 01:10:46,241
Oh don't, don't do that.
You know?

753
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:50,203
Don't do my drugs and
then leave on me.

754
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:52,497
Don't be one of those guys.

755
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:01,256
You want to come to the
bedroom for a little while?

756
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:48,548
I'm glad to see you.

757
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:51,509
Are you?

758
01:13:51,635 --> 01:13:53,511
I'm not sure I would be
if I were you.

759
01:13:53,637 --> 01:13:54,887
Yes, I am.

760
01:14:00,394 --> 01:14:02,061
How are you?

761
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:06,858
I'm great. You?

762
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:11,112
Good. Better.

763
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:16,200
That was a doozy?

764
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:19,620
We always liked a little
melodrama, you and I.

765
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:23,416
I guess we did.

766
01:14:24,543 --> 01:14:27,336
You know I ran into
everybody in your life

767
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:28,384
this past year but you.

768
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:30,882
I heard that.

769
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:35,178
The first person I saw when
I got back was Alassane.

770
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:38,556
On the corner of
9th and University.

771
01:14:38,682 --> 01:14:43,436
He gave me the biggest hug
anyone has ever given me.

772
01:14:43,562 --> 01:14:46,439
I will be grateful to that guy
for the rest of my life.

773
01:14:46,565 --> 01:14:50,568
He and Claire are not
together anymore.

774
01:14:50,694 --> 01:14:54,322
I'm sorry to hear that.
Was it the kid thing?

775
01:14:54,448 --> 01:14:55,990
Yeah.

776
01:14:56,116 --> 01:15:00,995
Since they broke up,
she and I have started

777
01:15:01,121 --> 01:15:03,206
that conversation again.

778
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:04,707
Have you?

779
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:05,666
Yeah.

780
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:12,507
I'm happy to see you,
I'm very happy to see you.

781
01:15:14,384 --> 01:15:18,804
You survived, Paul.
It's incredible.

782
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:21,557
I have. It is incredible.

783
01:15:28,732 --> 01:15:34,987
It amazes me that after all this
time I can still feel shocked

784
01:15:35,113 --> 01:15:38,574
I don't start and end
each day with you.

785
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:40,576
So what do we do now?

786
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:52,296
I don't know, Erik.
What do you think we should do?

787
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:58,803
I don't really want to
leave you yet.

788
01:16:01,348 --> 01:16:05,184
I think that's probably the best
thing for us right now.

789
01:16:08,438 --> 01:16:12,441
I think this has been the
perfect beginning for

790
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:15,528
whatever is going to happen.

791
01:16:22,744 --> 01:16:24,453
OK.

792
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:30,543
- OK.
- OK.

793
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:39,904
Would you turn that light on,
above the bed?

794
01:17:40,030 --> 01:17:41,822
I don't want to be in the
dark with you.

795
01:18:16,858 --> 01:18:19,819
I can't believe this
is happening.

796
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:33,750
Erik!

797
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:34,667
What?

798
01:18:36,503 --> 01:18:38,921
You're not supposed to be naked.

799
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:41,006
Okay.

800
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:13,414
We're not having sex.

801
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:14,498
No!

802
01:19:32,184 --> 01:19:34,143
I just want to be
naked with you.

803
01:19:40,484 --> 01:19:42,526
You smell like you.

804
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:55,790
I think that this is enough
for right now, okay?

805
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:58,250
OK.

806
01:20:16,561 --> 01:20:18,729
Hey! Hey!

807
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:23,359
Erik, right?

808
01:20:29,741 --> 01:20:34,370
Wait a minute. Ivan?

809
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:35,412
Igor.

810
01:20:35,539 --> 01:20:43,539
Oh my god, oh my god.
That's so embarrassing.

811
01:20:44,005 --> 01:20:47,299
Hey at least I knew it was a
Russian name, right?

812
01:20:47,425 --> 01:20:51,345
Hey it's okay.
It was a while ago.

813
01:20:51,471 --> 01:20:53,973
How's the...
how's the painting going?

814
01:20:54,099 --> 01:20:57,852
Good. How's the film business?

815
01:20:57,978 --> 01:21:00,229
Okay I guess...

816
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:08,863
Hey do you want to
get something to eat?

817
01:21:08,989 --> 01:21:10,948
I've got an hour.

818
01:21:11,074 --> 01:21:12,783
I'd sit with you.

819
01:21:14,244 --> 01:21:17,246
So, you're not with
your boyfriend.

820
01:21:17,372 --> 01:21:18,163
I don't know.

821
01:21:18,290 --> 01:21:24,086
He went away for a while,
then he came back,

822
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:27,840
and then we started seeing
each other again,

823
01:21:27,966 --> 01:21:30,885
and now I have no idea
what's going on.

824
01:21:35,765 --> 01:21:37,205
How long have you guys
been together?

825
01:21:37,309 --> 01:21:37,766
For nine years.

826
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:40,561
You're lucky.

827
01:21:44,941 --> 01:21:48,027
I don't feel lucky.

828
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:53,991
What about you?

829
01:21:55,118 --> 01:22:00,831
Well I'm sort of seeing
someone right now,

830
01:22:00,957 --> 01:22:06,795
but I always lose interest after
four months, six months,

831
01:22:06,922 --> 01:22:10,466
that's all they seem to last.

832
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:15,721
I'm seeing this guy now but
it's nothing serious.

833
01:22:15,847 --> 01:22:16,972
It's more like a fuck buddy.

834
01:22:17,098 --> 01:22:23,145
We go out to dinner sometimes -
mostly he talks, and I listen.

835
01:22:23,271 --> 01:22:26,190
I like being taken out for
dinner, what can I say?

836
01:22:26,316 --> 01:22:28,025
I'm superficial.

837
01:22:29,444 --> 01:22:33,238
Who doesn't like to be
taken out to dinner?

838
01:22:33,365 --> 01:22:35,115
I'll take you out to dinner.

839
01:22:36,409 --> 01:22:37,868
Yeah?

840
01:22:40,622 --> 01:22:41,914
Sure.

841
01:22:47,170 --> 01:22:49,755
I'd like that.

842
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:37,970
Hold on...

843
01:23:41,224 --> 01:23:43,475
Hey...

844
01:23:43,601 --> 01:23:44,268
Hi.

845
01:23:44,394 --> 01:23:45,811
Can we talk?

846
01:23:45,937 --> 01:23:47,938
Um, I'm on the phone.

847
01:23:52,569 --> 01:23:54,028
Can you give me a few minutes?

848
01:24:46,206 --> 01:24:49,083
Okay, so, what you got?

849
01:24:53,379 --> 01:24:56,423
How are you feeling
about things?

850
01:24:59,135 --> 01:25:00,636
You're putting it on me.

851
01:25:00,762 --> 01:25:02,262
No that's not what I
mean to be doing.

852
01:25:02,388 --> 01:25:04,973
I just, I think we need -

853
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:07,601
You just wanna know what
I think we should do.

854
01:25:10,522 --> 01:25:11,605
Yes.

855
01:25:16,694 --> 01:25:20,030
I think we should move
in together.

856
01:25:20,156 --> 01:25:23,325
Someplace totally new.

857
01:25:26,871 --> 01:25:29,665
Either that or break up
right now, you decide.

858
01:25:31,543 --> 01:25:34,002
That seems like a high
ultimatum, don't you think?

859
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:36,130
Then let's not do it.

860
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:44,221
Let's finally really, really,
really stop doing it.

861
01:25:44,347 --> 01:25:45,681
Don't say it like that.

862
01:25:45,807 --> 01:25:47,266
What do you want, Erik?

863
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:49,560
Be clear about that for
once in your life.

864
01:25:49,686 --> 01:25:51,270
I'm trying to.

865
01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:17,254
Erik... Erik.

866
01:26:40,403 --> 01:26:42,154
Stop it!

867
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:45,407
I don't have time for this.

868
01:26:48,161 --> 01:26:51,955
Jill is coming to pick me up to
take me to lunch with the kids.

869
01:26:52,081 --> 01:26:54,124
Then I'm taking the 3:20
train back to the city -

870
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:55,250
are you coming back then?

871
01:26:55,251 --> 01:26:57,961
No, I'm going to stay
here until tomorrow.

872
01:26:58,087 --> 01:26:59,671
I've got some work to do.

873
01:26:59,797 --> 01:27:00,672
Okay.

874
01:27:00,798 --> 01:27:04,259
Then you have to pick me
up at Jill's at 2:45

875
01:27:04,385 --> 01:27:07,179
to take me to the station.

876
01:27:12,810 --> 01:27:16,188
You have from now until then
to make your decision.

877
01:27:16,314 --> 01:27:18,440
I'm not going back to
the city by myself

878
01:27:18,566 --> 01:27:19,274
without this being decided.

879
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:22,152
I... I just think it's a little
weird that you give me what,

880
01:27:22,278 --> 01:27:24,947
3 hours?

881
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:26,406
To make a decision like this?

882
01:27:26,532 --> 01:27:27,324
I'm sorry.

883
01:27:31,246 --> 01:27:34,456
I'm not doing this in
order to be difficult.

884
01:27:34,582 --> 01:27:36,667
Or to...

885
01:27:36,793 --> 01:27:38,669
try to control things or
whatever you want to

886
01:27:38,795 --> 01:27:41,338
tell your friends I'm doing.

887
01:27:41,464 --> 01:27:46,260
I'm doing this because I have
to do this to save my life.

888
01:27:49,889 --> 01:27:53,141
Can you understand?

889
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:55,602
I do understand.

890
01:28:00,525 --> 01:28:02,234
I have to go.

891
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:05,654
Can you bring my suitcase later,
please?

892
01:28:54,495 --> 01:28:56,913
So do you have a
decision for me?

893
01:28:59,375 --> 01:29:01,585
Yes.

894
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:05,255
Yes, as in your answer is yes?

895
01:29:09,469 --> 01:29:11,011
Yes.

896
01:29:13,598 --> 01:29:14,306
Good.

897
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:21,355
You're not - you're not worried
about our fighting?

898
01:29:21,481 --> 01:29:22,439
Of course I am.

899
01:29:22,565 --> 01:29:26,526
I'm worried about a
lot of things.

900
01:29:30,281 --> 01:29:31,782
But I'm happy.

901
01:29:33,242 --> 01:29:34,409
Me too.

902
01:29:37,163 --> 01:29:38,663
You sure about this?

903
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:39,873
Yes.

904
01:29:39,999 --> 01:29:40,624
Are you?

905
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:42,125
Yes!

906
01:29:45,546 --> 01:29:46,046
Good.

907
01:30:00,645 --> 01:30:04,356
I'll see you in New York.
I love you.

908
01:30:04,482 --> 01:30:08,318
I love you too.

909
01:32:24,914 --> 01:32:26,039
Who is it?

910
01:32:26,165 --> 01:32:27,707
It's Erik.

911
01:32:52,525 --> 01:32:53,775
Come on in.

912
01:33:23,681 --> 01:33:25,557
You can't do it, right?

913
01:33:29,937 --> 01:33:30,562
No.

914
01:33:42,033 --> 01:33:44,701
Well we had some good times
together didn't we?

915
01:33:47,288 --> 01:33:49,164
We did.

916
01:34:11,812 --> 01:34:14,272
I need to get ready for work.

917
01:34:43,636 --> 01:34:47,597
I think I left my blue cashmere
sweater in your apartment.

918
01:34:47,723 --> 01:34:49,432
You did?

919
01:34:49,558 --> 01:34:51,101
And my raincoat, also.

920
01:34:51,227 --> 01:34:52,560
I saw that.

921
01:34:52,687 --> 01:34:56,773
Will you leave them with the
doorman for me please?

922
01:34:56,899 --> 01:34:57,774
Sure.

923
01:34:57,900 --> 01:34:59,734
I'll pick them up later.

924
01:35:04,198 --> 01:35:07,617
I don't think we should see each
other for a long time, Erik.

925
01:35:07,743 --> 01:35:09,536
I know.

926
01:35:12,665 --> 01:35:16,418
But you can call me if you need
me for anything, anytime.

927
01:35:17,628 --> 01:35:19,003
No.

928
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:21,548
I can't do that.

929
01:35:23,509 --> 01:35:24,676
It's okay.

930
01:35:27,304 --> 01:35:29,597
I do love you, Paul.

931
01:35:29,724 --> 01:35:35,103
Do you? I wonder.

932
01:35:35,229 --> 01:35:37,230
I do.

933
01:35:42,820 --> 01:35:48,491
Okay. Enough of this.

934
01:35:48,617 --> 01:35:49,701
I'm going to work.

935
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:54,497
I have a lot to do today.

936
01:36:15,686 --> 01:36:16,811
Be well.

937
01:36:16,937 --> 01:36:19,355
I will be.
