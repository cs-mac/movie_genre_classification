<i>Episode 51</i>

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,110
Soon Deok...

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,810
Yes.

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,940
Come to our place.
Together with Director Geum.

6
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,440
Did Master Jeong contact you?

7
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:19,970
It's not that, but it's important.

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,940
All right,

9
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,240
If I'm to come with
Director, then the evening.

10
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,610
It's fine with me.

11
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,450
Yes.

12
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,210
Did Master Jeong contact her?

13
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:37,470
It's not that, but Hwa Ran
unnie says to come by.

14
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,540
Please come check this, to
see if it's done right.

15
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,250
Yep.

16
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,770
Yes, Madame Oh.

17
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,240
Are you busy?!

18
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,040
No.

19
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,040
Can you stop by here today?

20
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,440
By myself?

21
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,820
Yes, yourself for now.

22
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,040
I got it. I'll come by before five.

23
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,720
Okay.

24
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,510
Dear, when are we going
to make winter kimchi?

25
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,420
We have to wait until it's cooler.
If we pickle them now, they'll get ripen too soon.

26
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:38,010
Our in-law's home... it's really so great.
Starting from the front garden, it's enormous.

27
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,170
Wish I could take a look around.

28
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,980
I'm sure they'll invite us soon.

29
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,440
Dear, how do you feel?

30
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,670
Am I strange?

31
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,340
No.

32
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:57,350
My mind feels refreshed, and
I think it's gone for good.

33
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,510
That's a relief

34
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,540
I should be good enough to
go to the company, right?

35
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:06,140
How many hours can you actually
work though, if you go now?

36
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,140
Just go on a stroll with Andre instead.

37
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,210
Then you come too, Dear.

38
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,140
Me too?!

39
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,070
Yep.

40
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,950
Andre, let's go.

41
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:24,410
Um, could we go somewhere far?
Enjoy a drive too.

42
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,270
Oh, how did it go?

43
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,770
It went well.

44
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,970
Are all his symptoms gone?

45
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,070
Yes.

46
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,610
Oh, that's good.

47
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,940
Please tell the madame I said thank you.

48
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,550
I didn't tell her it was Chairman Ah and
made it sound like it was someone else.

49
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,310
I see.

50
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,870
Is Sa Ran okay during all this?

51
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,040
She was quite startled and
worried, but I think she's fine.

52
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,340
Alright, then call me again
if someone else happens.

53
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,020
Yes, please hang up.

54
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,970
I keep wanting to eat.

55
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,070
Then you should be eating
a proper meal with rice.

56
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,370
Not really feel up to rice yet.

57
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,750
I'll run an errand and come back.

58
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,440
Oh, it's hot, after walking around.

59
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,280
Yep.

60
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,120
Kid.

61
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,210
Now I know what true happiness is.

62
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,670
What is that?

63
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,470
Being together with family,
without any issues.

64
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,540
That's right.

65
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,870
Earlier, at the temple, I prayed.

66
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,260
That if they would pull away the
ghost, I would live diligently...

67
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,710
even more diligently than I have until now.

68
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,240
Working diligently, you mean?

69
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:53,770
Work diligently too, but put
my best into my family too.

70
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,570
Up until now, to be honest,
the company was priority.

71
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,070
Really?

72
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,310
Can I count on that from now on?

73
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,480
Wait and see. I won't change.

74
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:13,170
There will be guests coming.
Have it so that they don't look for me.

75
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,650
Yes.

76
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,380
Yes?!

77
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,440
You said you'd be coming in the evening.

78
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:35,840
I think it'll be hard for Director
to come, because of the patients.

79
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:41,120
And I was curious too.
Does it have to be both of us?

80
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,610
Master Jeong...
there's nothing wrong, right?

81
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,620
He hasn't contacted us.

82
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,710
I said not to look for me. Who is it?

83
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,450
You have a guest here.

84
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,510
- Omo. -Hello!

85
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,470
I thought you couldn't come.

86
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,510
I had a patient who was in a bad
condition, but his condition improved.

87
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,210
Do you want some tea?

88
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,750
I already drank a lot today.

89
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:17,250
Today is a very happy day for me.
That's why I asked to meet.

90
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,040
Are you getting married?

91
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,920
No.

92
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,550
Director will probably understand
this by looking at it.

93
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:33,050
Genetic test result.

94
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:45,150
I'll tell you the conclusion first.
Soon Deok's daughter's been found.

95
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,620
You did?

96
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,210
Is she living well?

97
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,170
Very.

98
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,740
Where?!

99
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:59,040
Please don't be startled. It's actually...

100
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:01,450
It's Sa Ran

101
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,910
Sa Ran?!

102
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,910
Really?!

103
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,070
That's what the test result shows.

104
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,640
What did you test with?

105
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:14,840
Blood test. Last time, you
had a nosebleed, right?

106
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:17,520
How can it be Sa Ran?

107
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,310
It was an ahjumma who worked at
our house who took the child.

108
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,240
I thought it was a possibility too.
So, I asked my mother-in-law and she said no.

109
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,540
She said she went to check and
Sa Ran's mom isn't that ahjumma.

110
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,010
Why did she go check?

111
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:34,040
Because Sa Ran resembles my
mother-in-law so much from her youth.

112
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:36,390
It's for sure.

113
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,780
Sa Ran said this to me when
she was getting married...

114
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,210
that she was a foundling.

115
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,500
Her current mom is her step-mom

116
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,110
and her real mom passed away
when she was in high school.

117
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,240
But she later found out that
wasn't her real mom either,

118
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,620
but the mom who raised her.

119
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,170
How could it be?

120
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,790
It's probably the case that her deceased mom

121
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:58,500
was the ahjumma who worked
at Director Geum's house.

122
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,270
Are you sure?

123
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,400
Last week,

124
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:10,070
after I heard the whole story from Soon
Deok, and I was about to go to sleep.

125
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,870
Sa Ran's story came to my thoughts.

126
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:17,220
For it to be just a coincidence...
the circumstances are too similar,

127
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,710
so even though I still had doubt...

128
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,720
I called Sa Ran to come the next day.

129
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:27,140
I said she looked like she was
indigested and I pricked her fingers.

130
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:33,150
Then, I asked Doctor Kim Woo Jin of Daekyung
Hospital to run a DNA test for blood relations.

131
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,970
The result came out today,

132
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,600
and I was told it's a 99. 9% match.

133
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,450
Blood relations without a doubt.

134
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:49,570
Soon, Ah Da Mo will be coming here.

135
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,980
I was afraid it would startle her too much.

136
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:55,540
Since she's with child, I don't
want to startle her and the fetus.

137
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,240
So I called her husband to come first.

138
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:02,010
Sa Ran is?

139
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,520
Sa Ran is?!

140
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:09,720
But... the test couldn't be wrong...

141
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,310
it couldn't be wrong.

142
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,150
The blood from both were submitted
properly, and the result is this.

143
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,370
What are we to do... our Sa Ranee...

144
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,440
our pitiful daughter.

145
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:25,220
Because of this foolish mom of hers...

146
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,870
she had to become a gisaeng too.

147
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,670
All the food for the
hair-raising ceremony...

148
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,370
I made them with these hands of mine!

149
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,370
How could it happened?

150
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,990
What do I do?

151
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:46,840
She grew up thinking they
were her real parents.

152
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:49,940
But after the remarriage, her
current step-mom told her.

153
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:53,350
And that's how she ended
up becoming a gisaeng.

154
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,540
The first day she came, saying
she wanted to become a gisaeng.

155
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:02,140
The girl came in a daze.

156
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:04,610
Her wounds appeared to be so grave to me.

157
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,380
So I sent her away, telling
her to reconsider.

158
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:13,570
Da Mo... is he coming here without knowing?

159
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,970
Yes,

160
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,310
He said he'd be here by five.

161
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,540
She went through that kind of neglect...

162
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:22,540
that kind of pain.

163
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:26,010
Regardless, the end result is good.

164
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:30,110
How can I face Sa Ran now? With what right?

165
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,910
I asked her last time, and she said she was trying
hard to force herself not to think about it.

166
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,180
Since she didn't have a
way to find her parents.

167
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,940
Think of it as fate.

168
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:47,670
Regardless of what...
you've found her now, so it's good now.

169
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,820
A good thing for you both.

170
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:56,050
Omo, she's bleeding again.

171
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,880
She needs to lay down and stabilize a bit.

172
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:04,970
Go to the room next door and lay down.

173
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,870
I want to see her now.

174
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,270
After Da Mo gets here,
we'll discuss with him.

175
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,580
Get ahold of yourself.

176
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,410
I'm all right, I am all right.

177
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:16,220
Here.

178
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,710
Hello.

179
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,500
Have you been well?

180
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,770
I heard you'll be a dad next year.

181
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,840
Who said that?

182
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,480
Please go in

183
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:55,250
Did something unpleasant happen?

184
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,790
I've shed some rare tears.

185
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,870
I think we need to go.
Her nosebleeding won't stop.

186
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,350
You came.

187
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:07,620
Oh, you're!...

188
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,670
I'll call you later.

189
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,600
Yes.

190
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,810
Did he come with Kitchen Head?

191
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,810
Yep,

192
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,470
I think you'll need to
change how you address them.

193
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,970
And I will lower my speech
to you too, from now on.

194
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,340
Yes,

195
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:31,440
I should be calling her Madame, but I've
gotten too used to calling her Kitchen Head.

196
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:34,980
Not Kitchen Head, and not Madame either.

197
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:38,660
Actually, she's your mother-in-law.

198
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:45,300
Since Han Soon Deok and Director
Geum are Sa Ran's real parents.

199
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,570
You also knew, Chief Madame?

200
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:54,470
That Sa Ran was left outside Ra Ra's house?

201
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,570
You already knew?

202
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,490
Yes.

203
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,710
How?

204
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,170
Father-in-law knew which house they took Sa
Ran from, all these years, as it turns out.

205
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:06,710
Even though, previously he said he didn't know,
when I had my sister-in-law ask him about it.

206
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,440
I followed the address he gave and went to see
the house, and it was actually Ra Ra's house.

207
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,530
Director Geum's house.

208
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:13,950
But then?

209
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,010
Then, you should've revealed the truth.

210
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,070
Sa Ran didn't want that.

211
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:21,940
She said it would make her feel too
wretched and awkward to her friend.

212
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,260
On the off-chance that it's true,

213
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,020
I went behind Sa Ran's back
and hired an acting ahjumma.

214
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,080
But then?

215
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,600
They told her no one came
to look for the foundling.

216
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,640
Came to look for the child?

217
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,270
Yes.

218
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,970
Who said that?
Who said no one looked for it?

219
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:39,530
Since she said it was a middle-aged
madame, it must have been Kitchen Head.

220
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,690
It's somebody else.

221
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:43,710
It might be Ra Ra's real mother

222
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,620
Did you hear this from my mother-in-law?

223
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,040
Gong Joo's mother?!

224
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,160
Yes.

225
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,290
Han Soon Deok and...

226
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:55,790
Sa Ran's genetic test... I applied for it.

227
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,730
And today it came out as them being
biologically mother and daughter.

228
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,870
How could that be?

229
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,450
Director Geum knew Han Soon
Deok before he was married,

230
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,750
and that's when Sa Ran was conceived.

231
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,540
For many reasons, Soon Deok found
herself unsuitable for him,

232
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,090
so she didn't go meet him as promised.

233
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,800
And a few months later is when
she found out she was pregnant.

234
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,820
When Director Geum met with the woman
the families matched together,

235
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:24,120
he married Ra Ra's mother.

236
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,880
So what could she do?

237
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:29,690
She had the baby and left
it outside the Geum's.

238
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,320
But he sent his own child
away to a stranger?

239
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,500
Without knowing.

240
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,680
Soon Deok, she...

241
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,620
She's too innocent, like her name says.

242
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,360
She thought he would know and didn't say
it was his daughter on a piece of paper.

243
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:46,910
That family never imagined
it was their bloodline.

244
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,050
And, the deceased grandfather
said they wouldn't raise her.

245
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,910
Why?

246
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,120
Because his second daughter-in-law
was about to give birth very soon.

247
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:59,520
And that's how the ahjumma who worked there
ended up taking Sa Ran away to raise.

248
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,360
This is all really true?

249
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:04,220
The fact that Soon Deok had a baby...

250
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:07,240
she only told me that last week.

251
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,920
The part about the child taken
by the working ahjumma.

252
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,210
Concurred with Sa Ran's story.

253
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:14,160
And that's why I submitted
a test to be done.

254
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,360
With what?

255
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,900
Soon Deok...

256
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,520
she was so upset that day,
she had a nosebleed.

257
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,650
So, with that,

258
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:25,020
and with the blood from pricks I did on
Sa Ran, saying she looked indigested...

259
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,780
And the result...

260
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,820
came out today, saying
they are blood-related.

261
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:34,060
I was so shocked and joyful.

262
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,420
Soon Deok...

263
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,490
she just found out the truth not long ago
and went into a deep weeping session.

264
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:43,040
And suffered another round of nosebleed.

265
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,220
I hope nothing is wrong with her.

266
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:49,600
She couldn't even walk properly.

267
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,660
It's true, without any mistakes, right?

268
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,640
The blood test, and all
the circumstances concur.

269
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,010
Since she's pregnant.

270
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,910
I didn't want her to get too startled.

271
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,960
Soon Deok is quite startled right now.

272
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,060
Thank you.

273
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,120
I am so happy too, beyond
anything I can express.

274
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,280
If I tell her, she
probably won't believe me.

275
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,020
Please tell her yourself.

276
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,220
You think she'll be okay?

277
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,250
It's a joyful event. It won't go wrong.

278
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:23,400
Sa Ran longs for them so
much, quietly by herself.

279

280
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,780
Hello?

281
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,380
Busy?

282
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,750
I was making cheese.

283
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,660
Make cheese?

284
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,720
Cottage cheese.

285
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:55,640
Never heard of it.

286
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,930
You are something. Is it good?

287
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,010
It's light, but rich in taste.

288
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,620
I want to eat some.

289
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:06,190
It's easy. I'll teach you.

290
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,250
You don't even call, you brat.

291
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,620
You heard about me, right?

292
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,870
Yep, congratulations!

293
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,940
Actually I was going to call you.

294
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:17,510
No need for words.
I'll eat that cottage cheese instead.

295
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:22,420
Yep, so come tomorrow.
This needs to rest for a day.

296
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:25,160
My father-in-law isn't fond
of me leaving the home.

297
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:26,910
So he told me to call my
friends to come to the house.

298
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,640
Oh, look how you're bragging so much now.

299
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:31,750
I have a future father-in-law
too, I'll have you know.

300
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,650
In the U. S.?

301
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,330
No treasure is a real treasure
until you can wear it.

302
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:45,040
It's so good.

303
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,990
I might be late. You sleep first.

304
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,690
Alright.

305
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,700
Wow, this scent...

306
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,850
Maybe we should've called
first before coming?

307
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,330
Yes.

308
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,690
Omo.

309
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,160
Welcome.

310
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,840
Father and mother-in-law are eating out.

311
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,150
Okay.

312
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,450
You haven't had dinner yet, right?

313
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,250
I don't have any appetite to eat.
I ate lunch late.

314
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:40,980
Let's go to our room.
Chief Madame has something to tell you.

315
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:43,090
Should I set the dinner table?

316
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,620
You'll at least have some tea, right?

317
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,350
No.

318
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,980
What is the matter?

319
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:52,480
It's nothing bad.

320
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:57,090
Get your heart prepared
calmly and don't be startled.

321
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,630
Are you ready?

322
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,820
Go ahead.

323
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:10,160
Honey... we found your parents.

324
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,120
Rea... lly?

325
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:16,460
They are people you already know.

326
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,990
None other than Director Geum and his wife.

327
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,420
Don't joke.

328
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:25,610
It's not a joke.

329
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:30,010
Last time... the day I gave you a bracelet.

330
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:33,210
I said you looked indigested
on purpose to draw your blood.

331
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,800
So I could do a DNA test.

332
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:39,450
I had one done with Soon Deok's.

333
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:43,430
And today the result came out,
saying you two are blood-related.

334
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:55,980
Soon Deok was startled too and she was
so traumatized she had nose-bleeding.

335
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:58,660
She's laying at Geum Hospital right now.

336
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,350
It's really true?

337
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:08,050
Kitchen Head is...

338
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,220
Then, none other than Ra Ra's dad is...

339
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:13,520
Your real dad.

340
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,590
How?

341
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,750
Soon Deok thought Ra Ra was,
for twenty-five years...

342
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,280
She lived thinking Ra Ra was her daughter.

343
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:29,620
By the time she gave birth, the
director was already married.

344
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:32,310
And that's why she left the
baby on the doorsteps.

345
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,820
Thinking they would raise the baby for sure.

346
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:41,620
For just in case,

347
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:44,650
since she didn't know
who'd discover the baby.

348
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,480
Since she was afraid of causing
distress to the family.

349
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,880
She left the child without writing a line.

350
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,780
That the child was the director's child.

351
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:56,680
She thought the director
would know for sure.

352
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:59,690
But how was he supposed to know?

353
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,410
Since your grandfather said
they would not raise it.

354
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,950
The mom who raised you...

355
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,720
She happened to work
there, and she took you.

356
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:12,590
That's how things happened.

357
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:19,040
The important thing is that they
didn't abandon you on purpose.

358
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:21,540
Kitchen Head took you to your dad's house.

359
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:24,210
But Director Geum had no idea.

360
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,160
That was what happened.

361
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,970
Last week, Soon Deok
came to my house crying.

362
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:36,650
That she actually had given
birth to a daughter.

363
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,350
And that daughter...

364
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,390
She lived thinking that was Ra Ra.

365
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:47,960
But when she met Director Geum and heard
the story, it turned out she wasn't.

366
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:51,040
So, she had to find her child.

367
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:55,880
But her mother-in-law said they had gotten
no response, after putting out so many ads.

368
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,320
So they should just...

369
00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:00,250
give up.

370
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:04,170
They put out ads before, looking for
the ahjumma who worked at the house.

371
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:08,310
She asked me what she was supposed to do.

372
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,380
Without finding the child,

373
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:15,190
she had no confidence she could endure life.

374
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,090
This is really true, right?

375
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,720
It's without a doubt.

376
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:10,390
Don't cry too much. For the baby's sake.

377
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,750
Then...

378
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,050
Ra Ra is my younger sister (by cousin)?

379
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,420
Yup.

380
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:22,940
And Ja is your cousin too, and so is
Yeon Sang, who you haven't met yet.

381
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:25,980
This feels like a dream.

382
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:29,820
I was so curious about them
and longed for them so much.

383
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,050
Meet tomorrow.

384
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:38,540
Soon Deok needs to be stable today.

385
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:41,540
She's not ill with a disease, is she?

386
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,710
It's not that.

387
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,380
All these years...

388
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:49,150
I've never seen her nosebleed before.

389
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,120
Last time...

390
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:54,890
when she talked about you,
and today, just twice.

391
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,490
I'll try and call her.

392
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:06,790
Yes.

393
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,620
How is Soon Deok?

394
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:11,010
She's getting an injection
of Ringer's right now.

395
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,050
I'm here at Sa Ran's home.

396
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,480
Did you tell her?

397
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,950
Yes.

398
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,350
What does she say?

399
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,190
She's crying, of course.

400
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,640
She's not resenting us?

401
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:26,350
No.

402
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,850
Meet her tomorrow.

403
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,720
It's late today.

404
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:35,550
If I could...

405
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,520
I know how you must feel.

406
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:39,740
Later.

407
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:42,050
I'll call Da Mo.

408
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,990
Yes. Hang up then.

409
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:55,330
He's too choked up to talk.

410
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,580
Feed her something.

411
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:03,890
Yes.

412
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:06,900
Alright.

413
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,440
Madame's been admitted to the hospital?

414
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:14,030
She had a sudden bout of severe nosebleed,

415
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:16,460
so she's at the hospital,
getting a Ringer's IV.

416
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:20,930
This is all that's left of
the sweet bean porridge.

417
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:29,090
So this is actually made
for you, by your mother.

418
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,750
She attended our wedding too.

419
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:35,320
And they walked you in, for
the bridal entrance as well.

420
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:39,390
They put in their parental
duties, as I see it.

421
00:24:45,690 --> 00:25:06,290
Subtitles brought to you
by NTOTG team @ viki.com

422
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,740
Over here.

423
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,510
But I'm not late.

424
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,100
Just got here early somehow.

425
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,120
Coffee?

426
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:33,480
What are you two?

427
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:36,340
My wife.

428
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:39,760
I heard a lot about you.

429
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,260
Like what?

430
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:49,490
That you two live without
a lot of affection.

431
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,460
So what?

432
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:52,420
Just... that.

433
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:54,660
Do you like my husband?

434
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:55,760
Yes.

435
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:57,710
Oh yeah?

436
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:00,100
Give me your address.

437
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:00,860
Why?

438
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:03,290
I'll send him to you.
So you can live with him.

439
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,920
Dongho Apartment, building 605, number 103.

440
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:06,920
Are you that Ae Rin?

441
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,960
Yup. Hwang Ae Rin.

442
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:12,170
Dongho Apartment, building 605, number 103?

443
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:14,260
You live in a nice place, I see.

444
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,510
You escort her home well?

445
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,520
No, just a few times.

446
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,860
She's the one who likes me. Right?

447
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,100
You suit each other well.

448
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,080
Hey, Gong Joo.

449
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:30,830
The plan is a success?

450
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:33,170
Yeah, I think so.

451
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,020
You should go in my car!

452
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,810
You can come right away, right?

453
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,980
I'll pay you double.

454
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,760
Mother and father would be
so shocked and happy too.

455
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:58,690
Since you never know about
things, tell them tomorrow.

456
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:01,840
Just in case. I feel uneasy.

457
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:03,620
Why do you feel uneasy?

458
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:07,320
I feel like things will
change, after I sleep.

459
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,810
And they'll tell me there's
been a mistake or something.

460
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,190
Should we bet?

461
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,720
To me...

462
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:19,110
Not anyone else,

463
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:21,940
but those two...
that they are my real parents who bore me,

464
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,130
I can't believe it.

465
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:27,010
But I feel sure, without a doubt, now that
I've throught through all the situations.

466
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,840
What is it?

467
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,120
The fortune cooking! That day!

468
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:35,690
"Enjoy a happy day with your child."

469
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,560
It's true.

470
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:40,630
That was accurate like a ghost.

471
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:43,430
And we thought it was only accurate for us.

472
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,160
Could it really be true?

473
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:47,780
A normal blood test is one thing,

474
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,830
but a DNA test is without a doubt.

475
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,990
I think our Starling is our fortune baby.

476
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:57,560
I don't think I can sleep tonight.

477
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,970
Hello.

478
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,090
Ja's moving his stuff.

479
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,870
This way.

480
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,160
What is she talking about?

481
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,100
These books here, and
the stuff on this side.

482
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,420
No clothes?

483
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:18,030
In the closet over there.

484
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,670
Where are you moving these to?

485
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,560
Dongho Apartment, building 605, number 103.

486
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:23,590
Why?

487
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,010
I'll tell you later.

488
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:26,670
Ahjussi, you come here, please.

489
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,170
What brings you here?

490
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:40,530
Grandma told me to come
and see how sick she was.

491
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,680
Her migrane is a bit severe.

492
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,260
Shouldn't she get a CT scan or something?

493
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:49,170
Let's go and talk in my room.

494
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:02,120
Is it a very serious illness?

495
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:04,530
No.

496
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,750
Today,

497
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:09,020
something startled her.

498
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,590
What is it?

499
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,820
To you...

500
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,660
I feel bad and such.

501
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,380
What is it about?

502
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,920
Before I married...

503
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:23,010
I met your current aunt.
I told you that, right?

504
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,160
Yes, on an island.

505
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,770
She conceived a baby back then,

506
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,670
and I didn't know.

507
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,730
Without telling me,

508
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:37,620
she left the baby outside our house.

509
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:39,790
And we didn't now,

510
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,520
so we let the ahjumma who worked
for us take it to raise it.

511
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,430
Oh my gosh.

512
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:49,600
Your aunt had thought you were
her child for twenty-five years,

513
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,670
since your ages are similar.

514
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,700
How in the...

515
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,090
Then you have to find the child.

516
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,350
We found her today.

517
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,890
However...

518
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:06,860
She grew up under misfortune?

519
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:10,150
She's actually Sa Ran.

520
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,290
Sa Ran?

521
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,310
Yeah.

522
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,880
I was so startled and your aunt
was so startled as well...

523
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:19,290
And that's why she's in
that condition right now.

524
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,660
For real?

525
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:27,200
Chief Oh Hwa Ran of Buyonggak had a
DNA test done and told us the result.

526
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:32,560
I was on the phone with Sa Ran earlier
and I didn't sense that at all.

527
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:35,920
It was before she found out then.

528
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,250
This is outrageous.

529
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:44,730
The, it means Sa Ran's mom
used to work in our house.

530
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,920
But we saw her on the graduation.

531
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:49,000
How come you and everyone
else didn't recognize her?

532
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,560
Her current mom is a stepmom.

533
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:54,660
The deceased mom.

534
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:57,650
I can barely believe it myself.

535
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:01,660
Madame Oh said the blood
test was done perfectly.

536
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:05,840
But before I meet her tomorrow
and hear it myself...

537
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:09,590
It's probably not true.

538
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:12,720
I never heard from her that
her mom was her stepmom.

539
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:15,610
She told Madame Oh,

540
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:21,620
right before she married Da
Mo, that she was a foundling.

541
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:26,870
It looks like Da Mo's
family knew all this time.

542
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,560
When they were opposing her...

543
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:32,560
Now I remember.

544
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,970
Chairman Ah said,

545
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:38,130
other than being a gisaeng, Sa Ran...

546
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:41,330
She had another reason to be disqualifed,

547
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:47,100
but since it was her privacy, he
had no reason to talk about it.

548
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:50,990
So that was it.

549
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:54,710
All due to our fault.

550
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:59,030
But she and Gong Joo get along so well?

551
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,420
Because they are both good-hearted.

552
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:05,440
If it's all true,

553
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,060
then what do we do about Sa
Ran who is so pitiful...

554
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:11,130
From now on...

555
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,090
We need to treat her well.

556
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,600
Treating her well...

557
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:23,170
can that compensate for 25 years?

558
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:27,320
She had to enter Buyonggak too.

559
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:31,000
She suffered so much to get married.

560
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:34,530
You don't know.

561
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:38,620
How could you have done that?

562
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:43,820
How could you not recognize your
own child and give her away?

563
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,090
Grandpa...

564
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,860
If I were Sa Ran,

565
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,600
I wouldn't be able to forgive you.

566
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:03,870
Ra Ra is suppose to come over tomorrow.

567
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:06,880
Should I give her a call?

568
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,840
To say what?

569
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:13,130
Say you're not feeling well,
or that something came up.

570
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,060
I'll just deal with it head-on.

571
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,820
It's going to be another wound to Ra Ra.

572
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,420
What if she comes to resent and hate me too?

573
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:21,990
She wouldn't.

574
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:25,430
What wrong did you ever do?

575
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,360
Why do you have your phone off?

576
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:52,180
The battery went out.

577
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,130
Sorry.

578
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,340
There was a small wreck
right in front of me.

579
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,820
What is this talk about you
moving to Dongho Apartment?

580
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:58,720
Dongho Apartment?

581
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,630
She says you're moving
and the men are packing.

582
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:10,300
It's nearly done.

583
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:14,320
What's that?

584
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,740
I'll give you the divorce,
so you go live with her.

585
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,330
Divorce?

586
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:21,490
Actually. Honey, don't misunderstand.

587
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:23,270
Misunderstand?

588
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:25,180
100% misunderstand.

589
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,440
I'm back.

590
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:28,030
Then what did I see with my eyes?

591
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:31,140
Dear, these two are divorcing.

592
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,400
What are you talking about?

593
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,690
Geum Ja is having an affair.
I caught him today.

594
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,700
What?

595
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,110
Is this the truth?

596
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,260
No, what happened was...

597
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:45,000
She kept sending texts to Geum Ja, and he went out
with his hair done, so I followed him in a taxi.

598
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:47,240
And I caught him meeting a
girl named Hwang Ae Rin.

599
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,470
She said they were dating.

600
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:50,700
This rascal!

601
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,730
Dear!

602
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,390
I didn't do it! She...

603
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:57,010
Regardless, it's true you strayed one eye.

604
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:00,200
It's not that! Ra Ra noona...

605
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,230
she's her junior alum.

606
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,090
You heard yourself that
she said she liked you.

607
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,820
Dongho Apartment, building
605, number 103, right?

608
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,590
Yes.

609
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,090
AJUSHI! NO!

610
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:13,770
I'll pay for your service. How much is it?

611
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:15,180
Go now.

612
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,660
I already paid you.
Now, hurry and move these.

613
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:18,860
It's not!

614
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,590
Why are you moving my stuff
without my permission?

615
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,580
Call Ra Ra noona.

616
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,120
It was just a show.
She suggested we should put on a double act.

617
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,920
Just go along for now, and leave the stuff.

618
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:29,790
Yes, please go.

619
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,490
Please go.

620
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:35,220
Say something that makes sense.
You think I'm a dummy?

621
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:37,220
Just give her a call first!

622
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,000
Yeah, do.

623
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,620
Maybe her battery's out,
but she's not answering.

624
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,160
Noona said I needed to
make you feel jealous.

625
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,650
Write a novel, why don't you?

626
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:55,050
I guess she'll take your side though,
since blood is thicker than water?

627
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:59,790
Noona!

628
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,240
Ae Rin. Explain to her.

629
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:03,500
You stay still.

630
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:07,290
What is his relationship with
that girl named Hwang Ae Rin?

631
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:09,720
I'm not in any mood to
talk about that right now.

632
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:10,880
Why?

633
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:14,510
I'm about to be kicked out.
She says to divorce.

634
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,420
It was your idea.

635
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:28,330
What's wrong with her?

636
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,520
What does Ra Ra say?

637
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:35,230
She said Sa Ran was so pitiful.

638
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,350
Are you able to meet her tomorrow?

639
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,380
My headache's pretty much dissipated.

640
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,830
However,

641
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:48,660
I feel so happy,

642
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:52,080
and my heart is ready to burst.

643
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:56,120
I can only make time in the afternoon.

644
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:59,420
I have to go home and
prepare some things too.

645
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,990
Yes, go ahead and hang up please.

646
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,100
He says to meet around three
tomorrow, your father.

647
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:14,160
He wants to meet quickly, but he has
some patients with morning appointments.

648
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,610
Where?

649
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:17,150
He says to come to the house.

650
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,670
Then, I should just go alone?

651
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:21,630
Why? How can I not go?

652
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,130
But how can you vacate your job?

653
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,620
They'll be fine.

654
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:28,070
They are coming in.

655
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:29,790
Was the movie good?

656
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,310
Yup, very much.

657
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,420
It was chaotic and complicated.

658
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:36,680
It is, isn't it?

659
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,520
You look like you've been crying.

660
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,600
I haven't.

661
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:42,940
Did you upset her?

662
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,700
Ah, no!

663
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:50,480
Why the alcohol table?

664
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:59,230
It's something I need to
tell you after a drink.

665
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:17,490
What?

666
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,160
You want to tell me to leave?

667
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,930
Nope.

668
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,870
It's about Director Geum...
and Han Soon Deok.

669
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,070
They're separating?

670
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:32,080
They had a child together, as it turns out.

671
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:35,370
I only found out a few days ago too.

672
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:37,940
And, that child is none other than...

673
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:40,220
Sa Ran.

674
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,860
It's Sa Ran?

675
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,510
Chairman Ah's daughter-in-law?

676
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,770
How did this happen?

677
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,550
Say something that makes sense.

678
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:56,830
It's a very long story.

679
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:58,900
Really?

680
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:02,980
None other than Sa Ran ssi?

681
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:07,910
Then the child our ahjumma
took is none other than...

682
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:10,120
It's dumb-founding, isn't it?

683
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:12,860
How could he not know his own child?

684
00:39:12,870 --> 00:39:16,400
She didn't write any word that the
baby was the director's child,

685
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,640
in case it would trouble your marriage.

686
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:22,810
Then she should've at least
met with him to tell him.

687
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:28,380
She was afraid if they met, they
wouldn't be able to part and rekindle.

688
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:32,460
By then, Director Geum was
already a married man.

689
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:35,250
But still.

690
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:38,820
What crime did the child ever commit?

691
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:42,450
Sa Ran is the one who ended
up suffering everything.

692
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:49,060
Wow! It's really coming to an end. Thank you so
much Team Gisaeng! That's 26 weeks of hard work.

693
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:55,610
We all like to specially thank DramaDramaOK for
subbing 32,000+ lines for Gisaeng. That's dedication.

694
00:39:55,620 --> 00:40:06,240

696

Allieg8ter, Serenasf95for uploading the videos. Ahoxan for the srt files.

697
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,970
Thank you Everyone else for contributing
to New Tales of the Gisaeng!!

698
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:25,010
I love you.

699
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:33,530
Imagine how desperate I was
for your love to do that?

700
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:47,710
Are you down with bodyaches or what?

701
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:51,800
Mother.

702
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:55,550
I found our child.

703
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,930
You found the child, you said?

704
00:40:59,140 --> 00:40:59,970
Yes.

705
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:02,570
Where does she live? And how?

706
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,660
It was Sa Ran.

707
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:07,530
I told you, it's not her.

708
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,310
We already went and checked.

709
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:12,600
The current mom is a stepmom.

710
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,410
The mom who raised her...

711
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:18,160
She passed from an illness, while
Sa Ran was in high school.

712
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:21,950
And the deceased mom is the
ahjumma who worked here.

713
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:24,490
Sa Ran said that?

714
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:27,540
I heard it from Hwa Ran unnie.

715
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:30,130
Before her wedding,

716
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:33,710
she told Unnie only.

717
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:41,110
That she was abandoned outside a front door.

718
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,890
That she was a foundling.

719
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:49,560
But still, it might not be her.

720
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:52,400
Maybe not our house, but another house.

721
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:59,070
Hwa Ran unnie had a DNA
test done with blood.

722
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,760
And called us to come. So she could tell us.

723
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:05,670
It's without a doubt.

724
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,150
How could this be?

725
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:12,390
It's Sa Ran? If only we had known.

726
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:17,250
Then, the old man wouldn't have had to died.

727
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:21,220
My husband.

728
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:17,560
Your mother-in-law?

729
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:20,720
She went to a gathering.

730
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:25,180
We love you Team Gisaeng!!
Thank you for every minute of it! ^_^

731
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:28,310
It looks delicious.

732
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:50,630
After I heard it.

733
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:55,130
I was so shocked.

734
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:59,300
And heartbroken.

735
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:05,690
How did you endure through it?

736
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:16,030
You were my unnie all this time?

737
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:34,570
Mother,

738
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:37,740
Sa Ran should be coming now.

739
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:42,200
If you cry like that,
you'll wipe yourself out.

740
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:44,880
How can I not cry?

741
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:47,620
All the suffering she went through...

742
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:51,620
we know about it.

743
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,960
Is that her?

744
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:57,700
It's probably your son.

745
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,840
How do you feel?

746
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:12,840
I can't begin to explain it.

747
00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:15,470
And I still feel uneasy too.

748
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:18,290
But Ra Ra accepted it quite well.

749
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:21,930
She actually feels
heartbroken for me instead.

750
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:25,380
Since she knows all that you went through.

751
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:36,270
She's here?

752
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:37,200
Yes.

753
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:38,440
Together?

754
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:41,140
Son-in-law Ah was the one who rang.

755
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:10,990
I'm sorry, Sa Ran.

756
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:15,690
Your mom is such a fool.

757
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:20,220
I went to the temple because of you.

758
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:23,300
To pray that you'd grow up well.

759
00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:27,080
To pray that I could find you.

760
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:31,650
I didn't even know that... and...

761
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:34,770
I resented you every now and then,

762
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:39,250
because things were so hard and
I wanted to see you so badly.

763
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:52,600
Did you really give birth to me?

764
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:57,310
If you are the foundling,
then it's without a doubt.

765
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:00,340
You really are a foundling?

766
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:03,110
Yes.

767
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:08,660
My deceased mom took me from
the house she worked at.

768
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:12,820
How are we to do with this? It's for sure~!

769
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,650
Oh my... my granddaughter.

770
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:23,880
Your grandpa looked for you and he got sick from
it and passed away because of it, my child.

771
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:28,850
He thought you could be the one.

772
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:33,630
So, we made up an excuse
and went to your house.

773
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:36,170
But she wasn't the woman.

774
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:40,550
And after that he couldn't rile
up enough energy to get up.

775
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:46,530
My dear...

776
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,640
Let me have a look.

777
00:49:58,650 --> 00:50:04,180
Your grandpa was right.

778
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:10,020
You said your birthday was June 14th, right?

779
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:12,070
Yes.

780
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:16,080
That's the day you were
left outside the door.

781
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:19,690
You were actually born on the 8th.

782
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:26,000
Mother, please get ahold of yourself.
She also cried too much yesterday and ended up...

783
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:29,210
How can I be calm right now?

784
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:34,070
We went to your house, but she wasn't
the ahjumma who worked for us.

785
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:37,640
Imagine the despair.

786
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:41,100
After that, your grandpa
took to his sickbed.

787
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:47,270
He still couldn't give up and
wanted to do a DNA test.

788
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:49,790
He did?

789
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:53,560
Saying she clearly seemed
like our offspring.

790
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:57,340
But I stopped him and told him no.

791
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,280
How could I have imagined it?

792
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:07,330
Hair.

793
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:08,820
Your head hurts?

794
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:11,840
Which one should I give you?

795
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:14,040
Grandfather.

796
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:29,080
That day, he...

797
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:32,990
as he was passing away.

798
00:51:33,070 --> 00:51:36,720
He put his hand out saying "hair"...

799
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:43,690
I thought he meant his head was aching, so I
was trying to give him the pill envelope.

800
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:03,280
Today, I spent some money
to keep up an appearance.

801
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:04,740
What appearance money?

802
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:08,940
The broads told me I should buy
since I have a rich son-in-law now.

803
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:10,940
So I couldn't just behave
as if I was poor either.

804
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:15,810
They say if a person starts to think they are
poor, then, they really will become poor.

805
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:17,440
You did great!

806
00:52:17,530 --> 00:52:21,640
When we were little, the moms would squeeze
our noses to let the snots out, right?

807
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:25,920
That was meant for us to live big.

808
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:27,220
Really?

809
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,110
Yes.

810
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,240
I'm out right now.

811
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,820
Yes.

812
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:36,710
When I said I broke up with Da Mo ssi.

813
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:40,310
She told me to go be a gisaeng.

814
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:44,280
I said no, and she began to torment me.

815
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:49,340
She knew I drank milk every morning,
but she would empty the cartons.

816
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:50,560
Why, that...

817
00:52:50,630 --> 00:52:53,940
And put only my shoes out in the
balcony where sun comes in.

818
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:56,050
My world...

819
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:00,730
It was quite difficult.

820
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:04,480
But I still endured through.

821
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:08,010
So one day, she...

822
00:53:08,170 --> 00:53:10,170
Told me about that.

823
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,180
That you were a foundling?

824
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:15,840
Since they fed and educated me...

825
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:18,410
If the marriage is a dead issue...

826
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:22,370
It's my duty to, at least,
earn money to pay them back.

827
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:28,980
Oh my, and her face didn't look so evil.

828
00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:31,270
It's all my fault.

829
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:33,750
Because I was so pathetic.

830
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:37,210
I couldn't tell anyone about it.

831
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:39,970
And this is my first time mentioning it.

832
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:42,400
What else?

833
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,070
Now that I've talked about it.

834
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:47,240
I feel a bit less burdened.

835
00:53:47,330 --> 00:53:50,140
How broken-hearted you must have felt.

836
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:53,230
To go through that...

837
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:57,020
It's all in the past.

838
00:53:57,110 --> 00:54:02,620
Regardless, I entered Buyonggak and
that led to marrying Da Mo ssi.

839
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:07,080
And thanks to Madame Oh, we meet like this.

840
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:10,340
I don't want to resent you.

841
00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:13,820
You should resent.

842
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:17,180
I feel so happy.

843
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:19,740
And thankful.

844
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:23,220
How did you ever...

845
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:27,390
How did our daughter get
to grow up so beautifully.

846
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:50,060
Who is it?

847
00:54:51,450 --> 00:54:54,890
Oh, our daughter... without calling first?

848
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:57,080
What happened to son-in-law Geum?

849
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,240
He didn't come.

850
00:54:59,350 --> 00:55:01,140
Did you and Ja fight?

851
00:55:01,150 --> 00:55:03,140
No.

852
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:08,180
Unnie found her real parents.

853
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:09,620
Sa Ran did?

854
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:10,740
How?

855
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:14,010
It's none other than Ja's uncle and aunt.

856
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:18,530
Uncle and aunt... then Ra Ra's?

857
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:20,090
Yes.

858
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:24,240
So this means Unnie walked down the aisle
holding her real dad's hand, at her wedding.

859
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:28,140
You little brat. What joke is this?

860
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:31,380
Then call Unnie and see if it's a joke.

861
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:35,720
Ra Ra unnie said they
even did a DNA test too.

862
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:39,910
Mom, what are you going to do now?

863
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:40,940
What?

864
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:44,190
About forcing her to become a gisaeng?

865
00:55:49,790 --> 00:55:51,320
What are you doing?

866
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,550
I'm playing with Andre.

867
00:55:53,610 --> 00:55:56,390
Don't you want to see some Grand
Prince, since it's been a long time?

868
00:55:56,510 --> 00:55:58,240
Shark fin, you mean?

869
00:55:58,320 --> 00:55:59,710
Yes.

870
00:55:59,810 --> 00:56:01,590
Come out with Sa Ran to Beijing House.

871
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:03,880
Sa Ran went out and isn't home.

872
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:05,680
But she's with child. Where?

873
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:08,640
Da Mo came home during the
day and took her out.

874
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:10,740
Did they go to the hospital or something?

875
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:12,750
Nothing like that.

876
00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:14,980
I suppose they have some
business to tend to.

877
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:17,380
What business to tend to,
during his work hour?

878
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:19,980
Just bat an eye.

879
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:22,050
I'm sure they'll tell us later.

880
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:25,030
You should receive our greeting.

881
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:28,300
On what right?

882
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,390
It wasn't your choice either.

883
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,960
Do that.

884
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:41,250
Is this a dream or is this reality?

885
00:56:42,990 --> 00:56:46,510
Do one for Grandpa too, though
it's not his memorial day.

886
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:48,690
Yes.

887
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:07,680
If he were alive, how happy would he be.

888
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:11,850
As you know, I made a lot of mistakes.

889
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:14,630
Please forgive me and accept me fondly.

890
00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:16,140
I will do well in the future.

891
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:19,550
We share the same sentiment.

892
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:36,510
They should actually be grateful to us.

893
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,280
Grateful for what?

894
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:41,080
For raising her. And putting her through school.
And feeding her. And clothing her.

895
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:43,240
Did you feed and clothe her?
And educate her?

896
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:46,160
Spouses are two hearts in one body, girl.

897
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,240
If your father did, then we did it together.

898
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:50,020
Then you shouldn't have made her a gisaeng.

899
00:57:50,070 --> 00:57:51,170
Why are you nitpicking about it?

900
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,150
Because I feel shameful to face them.

901
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:55,160
No need to feel ashamed.

902
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:58,360
We're not the one who kicked
out our own bloodline.

903
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:03,480
All we ever did was a great deed, of raising
her like she was our own child, you know.

904
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:08,270
Don't you sigh.

905
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:10,350
I'll eat it well.

906
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:12,080
Yes. Yes.

907
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:14,280
I'm not in any mind to cook.

908
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:15,710
Oh, of course.

909
00:58:15,810 --> 00:58:18,640
Next time, I'll make you
something delicious.

910
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:21,520
Is this a dream or is this reality?

911
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:24,320
That's what I want to say.

912
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:32,340
Would that be enough, eating like that?

913
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:33,210
Yes.

914
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:34,840
I can only eat things that are refreshing.

915
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:38,140
This is your first meal
at your parent's house.

916
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:40,410
Will it do that you're only
eating rice and cucumbers?

917
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:41,780
It's yummy.

918
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:42,940
You don't have ice cream, do you?

919
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:43,810
We do.

920
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:46,540
Your mother-in-law likes walnut ice cream.

921
00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:47,880
Really?

922
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:51,580
Sa Ran's been living on ice cream
and sweet bean porridge these days.

923
00:58:51,590 --> 00:58:54,520
You two mother and daughter are alike.

924
00:58:57,270 --> 00:58:59,920
The issue is with son-in-law Ah's.

925
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,840
Would they treat us like in-laws now?

926
00:59:01,850 --> 00:59:04,240
They won't even look at us.

927
00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:07,680
They'll just be chummy with Ra Ra's.

928
00:59:07,690 --> 00:59:08,510
Aren't you hungry?

929
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:11,470
You're hungry under the situation now?

930
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:14,970
These kids... not even calling.

931
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:18,880
Just leave them be.
So they can enjoy a date.

932
00:59:18,890 --> 00:59:20,460
Yesterday, we did.

933
00:59:20,540 --> 00:59:23,550
The house feels like a temple building.

934
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:26,170
But we have Andre.

935
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:29,290
Andre is just Andre.

936
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:34,080
Are you really fine?

937
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:36,960
If you ever sense that I'm
strange, even a little,

938
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:39,020
tell me right away.

939
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:40,760
Yes.

940
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,400
Do you remember the fortune cookie?

941
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:46,480
Yes.

942
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:50,800
It was accurate exactly on that day.
To have a happy day with your child.

943
00:59:50,990 --> 00:59:52,310
It was, indeed.

944
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,980
And Master Jeong was so
accurate like a ghost too.

945
00:59:55,070 --> 00:59:57,840
He said if you marry, you
will find your child.

946
00:59:57,850 --> 01:00:00,580
That's why they rushed to marry.

947
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:02,310
I can't believe this.

948
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:05,250
Want me to pinch you?

949
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:11,520
But Mother-in-law, you are so young, you
must feel wronged to be called "grandma"...

950
01:00:11,570 --> 01:00:12,450
No

951
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:13,810
I am so happy.

952
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:16,110
And joyful beyond words can express.

953
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,210
What about you, Father-in-law?

954
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:19,780
I am the same, of course.

955
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:23,680
Did you, by chance, have a
conception dream of me?

956
01:00:23,770 --> 01:00:24,810
Of course.

957
01:00:24,930 --> 01:00:27,890
My... she still doubts?

958
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:30,840
Didn't she even dream your
conception dream for you?

959
01:00:30,850 --> 01:00:32,010
Yes.

960
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:37,880
The sky had a very full moon so I was
looking at it completely enraptured.

961
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:43,360
And in just a little bit, from that big moon,
small moons were popping out like popcorn.

962
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:47,420
They all popped out and fell into my skirt.

963
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:49,280
It's a great dream.

964
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:50,600
Of course.

965
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:53,580
It's a dream that means the
child will live well in luxury.

966
01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:56,280
Your mom barely hung on
in life, with that dream.

967
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,980
Because she had such a sturdy dream.

968
01:00:59,110 --> 01:01:01,760
And now all the dregs are gone.

969
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:05,230
A beautiful Sa Ran like you...

970
01:01:05,310 --> 01:01:06,410
is my daughter.

971
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:10,200
Not just beautiful.
She's so good-hearted as well.

972
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:18,730
It's father.

973
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:20,600
Hello?

974
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:22,200
Why aren't you guys coming home?

975
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:23,560
We're about to leave.

976
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:25,260
Where are you?

977
01:01:25,370 --> 01:01:26,940
I'll tell you after I get home.

978
01:01:27,090 --> 01:01:29,320
You sure it's not because Sa Ran is ill?

979
01:01:29,380 --> 01:01:31,000
It's not.

980
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:32,080
Alright.

981
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:34,430
Yes.

982
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:37,880
Tell your father I'd like to meet him first.

983
01:01:37,950 --> 01:01:38,950
When would be good?

984
01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:41,580
Tomorrow works too.

985
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:43,680
So, anytime that works with
your father's schedule.

986
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,550
Yes.

987
01:01:48,890 --> 01:01:52,240
I wish I could talk to you
throughout the night.

988
01:01:52,390 --> 01:01:54,340
I'll come again tomorrow, Grandma.

989
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,280
Alright.

990
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:08,580
Sa Ran.

991
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:10,990
You should live with us too.

992
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:12,380
Of course.

993
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:13,810
Yes.

994
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:14,940
What about me?

995
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:18,330
The thread won't follow the needle?

996
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:23,970
What expression do you suppose
my father would have?

997
01:02:29,730 --> 01:02:31,560
It's all done.

998
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:34,750
Yes. I was going to wash my hands.

999
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:37,240
You haven't heard, right?

1000
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:38,300
About what?

1001
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:42,380
Miss Dan is Kitchen Head Han
Soon Deok's real daughter.

1002
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:43,320
What?!

1003
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:46,160
And the real dad is Director Geum.

1004
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:49,500
So you mean, Eun Sung's
daughter-in-law, Dan Sa Ran is...?

1005
01:02:49,570 --> 01:02:50,960
Yes.

1006
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:52,820
Oh my world.

1007
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:59,050
Manager. Manager!

1008
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:06,080
Where did you guys go for the whole day?

1009
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:07,690
It wasn't a whole day.

1010
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:09,420
Maybe you went to the villa?

1011
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:10,470
To see the fallen leaves?

1012
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:12,300
No.

1013
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:15,000
Father...

1014
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:19,280
Sa Ran found her real parents who bore her.

1015
01:03:19,490 --> 01:03:21,620
What?!

1016
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:23,660
How?!

1017
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:24,660
Through blood test.

1018
01:03:24,740 --> 01:03:26,770
Where do they live? In Seoul?

1019
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:27,440
Yes.

1020
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:29,340
We went to see them and had dinner.

1021
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:30,630
They called you?

1022
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:33,440
We only found out yesterday, but...

1023
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:36,570
Father, don't be startled.

1024
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:42,250
Those two who were seated at Sa Ran's
presiding seats, at the wedding.

1025
01:03:42,930 --> 01:03:46,430
Those two who sat at the
presiding seats were...

1026
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:49,030
Hospital director Geum Eo San?

1027
01:03:49,130 --> 01:03:50,840
Yes!
