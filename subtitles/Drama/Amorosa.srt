1
00:00:26,993 --> 00:00:28,199
Found you!

2
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:40,715
Come. I'll show you something.

3
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:47,625
Just a second.

4
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:51,321
- What are you doing here, Jun?
- Don't go with Jerry!

5
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:54,331
Go home.
Your Mother must be looking for you.

6
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:56,692
What's this?
Why are we here?

7
00:00:56,756 --> 00:00:59,066
Because we're alone here.

8
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,075
Jerry?

9
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:14,451
Hello, Sandra!

10
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:19,780
- No!
- Get her!

11
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:37,534
But this is seasonal.

12
00:01:38,198 --> 00:01:40,701
I only did it for Mom.

13
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:45,243
Besides, I could probably bring her
to Canada in three years.

14
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,251
She won't need to work anymore.

15
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:48,650
- Thank you, honey.
- Plus...

16
00:01:48,708 --> 00:01:51,985
she will be more relaxed
once we're there.

17
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:54,250
How about you?

18
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:03,258
Amiel?

19
00:02:04,157 --> 00:02:05,830
Amiel?

20
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:09,965
- Mom! You scared it away!
- I'm sorry, Amiel.

21
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:12,703
- I didn't know.
- Aw, it flew away. Rommel will be sad.

22
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:14,142
Aww, Mom.

23
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,912
I'm so sorry.
At least you still have one.

24
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,917
But it will feel lonely.

25
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,011
Let's catch another one later, okay?

26
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:26,751
- There!
- Nobody move. Nobody move.

27
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,657
- Amiel, don't move.
- I'm not moving.

28
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,593
Get it, Rommel!

29
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:39,865
There's so much on your hair.

30
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,607
Mom, does beer taste good?

31
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:47,607
Beer?
You're still too young for that.

32
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,147
Wait till you grow up, okay?

33
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,174
Don't think about it right now.

34
00:02:52,238 --> 00:02:56,846
I won't. Papa might get mad
if I ask him again.

35
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,488
Good boy.

36
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:06,323
Mom, can Rommel and
I play Aunt Lola's piano?

37
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:07,296
Sure.

38
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,501
Let me see.

39
00:03:11,057 --> 00:03:15,836
Wow. Amiel's so handsome.

40
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:18,671
And Amiel's mommy is so beautiful.

41
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:24,845
Wait. Let me memorize your face
so I won't forget it.

42
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,388
I love you, son.

43
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:42,797
I love you, mom.

44
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,928
Rommel, let's practice?

45
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:46,993
Game.

46
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,206
Practice what?

47
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:57,179
We'll still go here even if
I can't see anymore, right?

48
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,074
I should learn my way
around the house, right?

49
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:10,888
Start practicing now.

50
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:15,131
Eight steps forward.
One to the left. Go.

51
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,599
Retinitis Pigmentosa, auntie.

52
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:01,368
There's no cure.
It's genetic.

53
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,579
He got it from me.
I'm the carrier.

54
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:07,909
It's my fault.

55
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:13,489
Do you know why
you're named Amorosa?

56
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,351
Because you're so loving.

57
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:20,261
Don't blame yourself.
it's not your fault.

58
00:05:20,753 --> 00:05:23,927
You are a good mother.
Look at your children.

59
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:30,339
So, what do you think?

60
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:33,878
- Do you like the renovation I did?
- Yes, I do, Auntie.

61
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:37,345
I got this cheap.
I saw it in the ads.

62
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:42,915
I thought it would be
a good business, right?

63
00:05:42,975 --> 00:05:47,583
Speaking of business,
how's yours and Lito's business doing?

64
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,559
Oh, Auntie.

65
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,557
What?

66
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:55,098
- We failed.
- Oh my God.

67
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,597
We couldn't save it
so we just sold it.

68
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:01,639
I told him it's a good thing
we had some money in the bank.

69
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:08,072
Don't worry.
I will give you this house.

70
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:39,266
You're like a ghost.
You come out of nowhere.

71
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:40,804
Are you a guest?

72
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:46,078
Sir, the gardener's assistant
is never invited to parties.

73
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,977
Once you all leave...

74
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:51,486
I'll be the one to patch up
the grass in the garden.

75
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,861
You caught two doves?

76
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,157
Of course. You can have them.

77
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:03,162
- Are you sure? Thanks.
- Yeah, take them.

78
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:06,737
I'm Rommel, by the way.

79
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:07,669
Amanda?

80
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:09,764
Take care of the doves, okay?

81
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:10,739
- Of course.
- Let's go, Amanda.

82
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,077
That's Mr. Pedro, my Uncle.

83
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:17,876
I plant the flowers because
they die when he does it.

84
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:20,674
His hands are too hot
because he's a healer.

85
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,048
Amanda, I'm not deaf.

86
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,213
Why are you making up stories?

87
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,779
I'm telling the truth.

88
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:27,984
I'm going to take them, okay?

89
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:29,890
- Thanks. I'll take care of them.
- Okay. Sure.

90
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,327
Don't worry.
I'll name one after you.

91
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:39,130
And I'll name the other one
after me-Amanda.

92
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:44,733
You're not yet circumcised,
but you already have a girlfriend.

93
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:47,171
Stop it, Amiel.

94
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:52,540
Mom, you look sad again.
Please smile.

95
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:55,178
Come here.

96
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,993
Rommel, do you remember our promise?

97
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,026
We'll take care of your brother.

98
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:09,862
No quitting. No giving up.

99
00:08:09,922 --> 00:08:14,428
Yes, Mom. No quitting. No giving up.
We'll take care of big brother.

100
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:23,344
My son, you always give me strength.

101
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:26,645
- I love you so much.
- I love you too, mom.

102
00:08:26,906 --> 00:08:30,786
For the best mommy
in the whole world.

103
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:33,520
Wow! More food!

104
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:37,187
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

105
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,627
My boys.

106
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,090
Amiel, this school you Want
to attend is too far away.

107
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:43,895
So inaccessible.

108
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:47,231
Mom, can I stay there while I study?

109
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,540
Are you crazy? Who told you
I'd let you be on your own?

110
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,175
If you really Want to study here...

111
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,577
We'll just live in
Aunt Lola's pension house.

112
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:58,115
It's near the school.

113
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:04,082
Come on, Rosa. Let the boys be.
They're grown ups now.

114
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:07,022
You're turning them into Mama's boys.

115
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:11,289
Can't you see Amiel's condition?
You know he's blind.

116
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:15,025
Amiel, this is it, right?

117
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,323
Amiel, my son. You're back.

118
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:48,260
Big bro, you wanted
a blue rosary, right?

119
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,598
Here, I made this for you.

120
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,398
That's special.

121
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:55,161
Home for the blind?

122
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:58,436
Why didn't you tell me
this was a home for the blind?

123
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,737
What kind of mother do you think I am?

124
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:06,039
Mom, I never said
you weren't a good mother...

125
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:08,218
but I want to stay here.

126
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,777
Instead of working and earning money,
you're unable to because...

127
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:13,346
Don't use my work problems
as an excuse.

128
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:14,914
Mom, my eyes are gone.

129
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:18,121
It's more costly if you
hire someone to look after me.

130
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:21,392
And Dad was approved for work
in Abu Dhabi, right?

131
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,130
Rommel's here for you.

132
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,169
- Bro, it's all good.
- Rommel, you're about to graduate.

133
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:33,602
Isn't it more practical this way?

134
00:10:33,699 --> 00:10:37,146
- No cost...
- Son, I can do something about it.

135
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:39,244
You don't have to live here.

136
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,114
I don't want to be
a burden anymore.

137
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:45,982
You'll never be a burden to us.

138
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,623
They're no longer babies.

139
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:55,496
And what's wrong if they want
to help us financially?

140
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:59,861
I'll be the one
to get us through this.

141
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:03,471
I won't let my children make sacrifices
for your failed ventures...

142
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:09,036
- Mom, Dad, stop it.
- You talk as if I'm a worthless father.

143
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:13,015
Well, who else got addicted
to gambling and drinking?

144
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,786
It's not my children's fault
that we lost all our savings...

145
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:21,313
and surely I'm not the one
who got us neck deep in debts.

146
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,986
Mom, please stop.

147
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:26,222
Amiel got his blindness
from the side of your family.

148
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:56,355
What happened?

149
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:59,154
You got into an accident, miss.

150
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:09,603
- Lito! Lito! Lito! Lito!
- The driver got thrown off.

151
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:23,779
- Please sit down.
- Help! Hurry!

152
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:25,548
The van's gonna fall.

153
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,659
Miss, you're hurt.

154
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:31,592
- Just sit down.
- My boys.

155
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,760
- I've got to get to them.
- Ma'am, just stay here.

156
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:36,800
Amiel! Rommel!

157
00:12:36,856 --> 00:12:38,836
Miss, who do we save first?

158
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:42,193
- Who do We save first?
- What do you mean?

159
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:45,300
- Please save both of my children.
- You need to choose.

160
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:47,002
The car will fall any minute.

161
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:50,673
Don't make me choose. I can't.

162
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:53,578
Miss, who do we save?

163
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:54,980
The one in glasses or the other one?

164
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,486
Please, Miss. Just stay put.

165
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,955
You might get hurt even more...

166
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:03,152
- if you don't stop.
- The one wearing glasses.

167
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:04,888
The one with glasses. Where is he?

168
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:09,756
Where's the one with glasses?
Where?

169
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:13,302
Amiel! Amiel!

170
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:27,313
Amiel.

171
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:30,276
Mom?

172
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:35,151
It's late, where's your brother?

173
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:43,628
He just went out. He'll be back.

174
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:50,033
Rommel. Cool.

175
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:54,235
Rommel. I want you to meet
some people, Dude.

176
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,779
My boys down south.

177
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:59,849
Yeah, sure. Just text me where.

178
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:00,610
Game?

179
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:03,617
Bro, this is okay, they're suppliers too.

180
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,654
Mom alert, man.

181
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:16,893
Dammit! I told you
she knew this place.

182
00:14:16,956 --> 00:14:18,765
Sorry, Bro.

183
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:26,435
Rommel. Rommel.
Come on. Let's go home.

184
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:29,342
Mom, why are you here?
Go home.

185
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:32,644
I'll be home soon.
I don't need you to pick me up.

186
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,913
Ma'am, I'll take care of Rommel.

187
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:39,952
He's my bro. We're fine. Promise.

188
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:45,693
Rudolf, look at you.

189
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:47,856
And you're telling me
you'll take care of my son?

190
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,560
I know your antics. Just stop it.

191
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:54,236
Rommel, let's go. We're going home.
Mom, please.

192
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:57,669
Okay.

193
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:05,011
Fine, let's just go!

194
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,047
Rommel.

195
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,456
Bye, Rommel. Be safe.

196
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:18,357
You know, if you were in school,
I wouldn't have to do that.

197
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,862
Next school year...

198
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:21,462
- you're gonna study again.
- Mom!

199
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:25,261
If you ever pick me up again,
I won't forgive you.

200
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:27,565
Rommel, aren't you ever
going to listen to me?

201
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:28,696
You're so annoying!

202
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:33,107
We had a deal. Have you forgotten?

203
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:37,845
- What deal?
- No quitting. No giving up.

204
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:41,809
When you were little.
Don't you remember?

205
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,312
It was our pledge.

206
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:48,654
You always said "Mom, I'll help you
take care of big brother."

207
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:52,093
And I always told you,
"Son, thank you so much...

208
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,893
for being the one
to give me strength."

209
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:01,161
That's in the past.
I already forgot.

210
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:06,437
Well, I haven't, because even now
it's still you who gives me strength.

211
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:12,078
We're moving to the
pension house of Aunt Lola.

212
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,514
There you go again.

213
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:15,051
Didn't I tell you countless times
I don't want?!

214
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:16,780
Our house is being seized
by the bank.

215
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:21,451
We've got one week to move out.

216
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,357
Then why there?

217
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,419
Because I need a job.

218
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:32,469
I've talked to Aunt Lola.
She'll pay me.

219
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:36,795
I'll manage the inn. I can do that.

220
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:42,168
This is a great place.
It's peaceful and tidy.

221
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:44,737
It's better to live here.

222
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:48,210
Okay, you take care of that.
Cover it with newspaper.

223
00:16:48,273 --> 00:16:49,411
Yes, Sir.

224
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,655
Why is there a crime scene?

225
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:11,933
Ma'am. Ma'am Rosa. Hello.

226
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:15,612
Auntie Lola called me about you.
Yes, she did.

227
00:17:15,667 --> 00:17:21,777
By the way, I am Florida Bulaong,
reception and overall supervision.

228
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:27,916
What should I call you?
Is it Rosie, Rose, Rosetta...

229
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,221
- Rosa.
- Oh yes, yes.

230
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:31,693
Has Eugenia left already?

231
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:36,165
Oh, my predessor-hey, predessor.
English.

232
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:39,598
She's not here anymore. Left long ago.
She went to Australia.

233
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:44,631
Rommel, take care of the luggage
and help your brother too, okay?

234
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:46,403
Let's go, Ma'am.
I'll put you inside.

235
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:10,425
Wow. This is exciting.
New house, new life.

236
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:17,273
The layout is still the same.
Here's the kitchen.

237
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:19,339
There are fifteen rooms.

238
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:22,106
We don't have a lot of customers
this time of year.

239
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,448
It's off peak.

240
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:27,712
And there are
many competitors around...

241
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:32,347
and their Bed and Breakfasts have been
renovated to look better.

242
00:18:34,813 --> 00:18:36,690
My daughter, Nadia

243
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,829
Good morning. Hello.

244
00:18:39,184 --> 00:18:40,561
Good morning, Nadia.

245
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:42,558
Anyways, Ma'am.

246
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:46,261
Here's Lulu for our laundry
and chambermaiding.

247
00:18:46,325 --> 00:18:47,895
- Good morning, Ma'am.
- Good morning.

248
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,567
Oh, yes. This is Edu,
the very young carpenter.

249
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,506
Good morning.

250
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:54,740
Where can I charge my phone?

251
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,838
- Lulu. Lulu, assistance please.
- Can I charge my phone?

252
00:18:57,903 --> 00:18:59,644
Yes, Ma'am.
I'll do it for you, Ma'am.

253
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:00,513
Thank you.

254
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:08,214
Ma'am, Ma'am. What happened, Ma'am?
Can I help you, Ma'am?

255
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,123
No, I'm fine.
There was an insect.

256
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:11,422
It's gone now.

257
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,888
Lulu, fix it.

258
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,155
Thank you very much.

259
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,789
Cleaning. Cleaning.
Cleaning. Go, girl.

260
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:17,495
By the way, these are my sons.

261
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,365
Rommel and...

262
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:20,695
- Hi, Rommel.
- Rommel.

263
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:32,474
Snob. Unlike the other one. Friendly.

264
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:38,345
Ma'am, please forgive my daughter.
Her father's an alien.

265
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,481
And who's the alien's mommy?

266
00:19:41,213 --> 00:19:43,887
Your daughter's funny. Very energetic.

267
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:49,462
Oh, yes. I'm so proud of her.
Very proud.

268
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:30,996
Eight steps forward. One to the left.

269
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,525
Rommel, where are you going?

270
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:28,155
Just gonna go out.

271
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:35,705
Mom, why do you think Rommel
changed after the accident?

272
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,154
Do you see it?

273
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:01,828
Yes.

274
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:03,460
I don't.

275
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:06,695
Well, it's because
you're blind, isn't it?

276
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:10,333
More often since you arrived.

277
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:14,507
Looks like there are
guests checking in.

278
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,141
That's good.
it's not just a café anymore.

279
00:22:22,107 --> 00:22:24,053
I'm already sleepy, Babe.

280
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,645
Let's go to sleep then.

281
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:41,598
Let's go. Your mother's
looking for you. Let's go home.

282
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:52,381
Babe.

283
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:53,609
Babe...

284
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:57,450
- I thought we're just going to sleep?
- Yeah, in a bit.

285
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,556
- I'm tired.
- No, it'll be fine.

286
00:23:01,012 --> 00:23:02,252
- Babe, I'm tired.
- Come on.

287
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:05,591
Babe, I said
I'm tired from work, okay?

288
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:08,392
- Why did you push me?
- You're tired?

289
00:23:09,087 --> 00:23:10,191
What do you want?

290
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,170
Why did you hit me?

291
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,539
This is what you want, isn't it?

292
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:21,203
Ouch!

293
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:25,112
- Come on. Please?
- Fine. I'll just take a shower.

294
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,613
Hurry up.

295
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,415
Babe, hurry it up.

296
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:36,220
Just a second.

297
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:53,677
- Babe, let's go. Hurry, hurry.
- Why, babe? What is it?

298
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:55,473
Hold on, Babe.
I'll just put my clothes on.

299
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,138
No, let's go. Come on!

300
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:02,652
We'll never come back here again.

301
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:05,210
Thank you. And please come again.

302
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:35,073
Sir Edu, we saw a dead body
while on our way here yesterday.

303
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,382
That was our neighbor.

304
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:44,155
It was Carding.
He raped his fifteen year old daughter.

305
00:24:46,852 --> 00:24:49,423
The killer must have been very angry.

306
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:51,692
His face was crushed.

307
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:54,298
Many have died here.

308
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,132
They say all of them were rapists.

309
00:24:57,195 --> 00:25:01,940
They say a rape victim's ghost
is the killer.

310
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:07,110
They say she made a deal with
dark forces to seek revenge.

311
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:15,789
Wow, Sir Edu, where did you hear that?

312
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:17,086
From your ancestors?

313
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:20,054
You're kidding.

314
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:22,056
- "Dark forces".
- Here.

315
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:25,765
Pinoy Ghost Tales Volume 8

316
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:28,003
Later, son.

317
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:12,415
Don't go in there.
She's always there.

318
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:18,111
Oh, you rascal, always seeing things.
You're like a cop sniffing around.

319
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:21,287
Ma'am, are you okay?

320
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:22,855
I'm okay.

321
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:30,825
Ma'am that's just the wind.
it's the wind.

322
00:26:32,524 --> 00:26:33,798
Oh, you.

323
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:43,144
Mom, you'll feel better in a while.

324
00:26:46,304 --> 00:26:47,942
Ma'am what's that for?

325
00:26:49,507 --> 00:26:51,009
Stress reliever?

326
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:57,951
Yeah. My doctor diagnosed me...

327
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:01,725
with post-traumatic stress disorder
after the accident.

328
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:07,701
I can't relax. I can't stay calm.
I get paranoid.

329
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:09,232
Hallucinations.

330
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:12,138
Hallucinachon.

331
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:15,144
Not hallucinachon, mommy.
Hallucination.

332
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,079
It's the same thing, you silly kid.

333
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:22,278
Ma'am this is Sgt. Villegas.

334
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:27,348
Mrs. Calderon.

335
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:30,918
- SPO4 Caldo.
- Hi. Good morning.

336
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:34,496
- Coffee. Please sit down.
- Thank you.

337
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:37,033
To what do I owe the pleasure
of your presence, Sergeant?

338
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,863
Yes, Ma'am.

339
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,403
There are a lot of unpleasant
memories in this place.

340
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:46,406
Just a few days ago,
a man was brutally murdered.

341
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:50,335
He was accused of sexually
abusing his teenage daughter.

342
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,313
You'll be living here?

343
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,280
Yes, Aunt Lola asked me to work here.

344
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:02,291
And my children have fond memories
in this pension house.

345
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:05,692
Please be careful.
There are a lot of murder cases here.

346
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,960
Sir, there's an update on the case.

347
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:14,661
Let's go. We'll go ahead, ma'am.
Thank you for the coffee.

348
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,670
If there's anything...
just call me in the station.

349
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:20,232
- We'll be going now, Ma'am.
- So, it's really dangerous here.

350
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,170
Please take care.

351
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:24,008
Yeah, you too.

352
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:51,164
Help me.

353
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,210
Rommel?

354
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:07,485
Amiel?

355
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,377
Rommel?

356
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:32,775
Amiel?

357
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,456
Amiel?

358
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:28,562
Amiel?

359
00:31:52,677 --> 00:31:56,250
Amiel? Rommel?

360
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:22,910
Who are you?

361
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:27,619
What are you doing here?

362
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,859
I'm calling the police.

363
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:33,687
Who are you?!

364
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:40,935
Why does God let this happen to us?

365
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:44,169
Why does He make us choose this Way?

366
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:02,715
You, Rosa.
He'll be taken away from you. Soon!

367
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:34,952
Rommel?

368
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:40,292
Rommel, what are you doing out here?
Why aren't you in bed?

369
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:46,161
Amiel.

370
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,866
Didn't Rommel go out, Mom?

371
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:56,100
Oh yeah.

372
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:03,284
Amiel.

373
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:09,186
Can you hear anything?

374
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:14,227
Mom, I'm blind. Not deaf.

375
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:22,203
You? Do you hear it?

376
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:29,538
Your bed is calling you.

377
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,913
Go rest. I'll take care of Rommel.

378
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,982
I'll wait for him.

379
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:41,713
You sure?

380
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,322
Thanks, son.

381
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:00,942
Miss, which one?

382
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:02,670
- The one with glasses or the other one?
- The one with glasses.

383
00:35:02,733 --> 00:35:05,577
The one with glasses.
Where's the one with glasses?

384
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:10,847
Where? Amiel!

385
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,221
Rommel.

386
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:26,731
- Bro.
- Bro, how are you?

387
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:28,001
What's up?

388
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:30,005
Nothing new.

389
00:35:30,061 --> 00:35:33,406
Oh yeah, boys... This is Glen.

390
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:36,645
This is William.

391
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:39,647
This stuffs great.

392
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:42,384
- William's a supplier.
- Are you sure?

393
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:45,651
Let's go there.

394
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:49,491
- Where are you going?
- Just here. Come on.

395
00:35:50,915 --> 00:35:52,519
- Dude, nice meeting you.
- Hi, Miss Beautiful.

396
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:54,026
Can we sit?

397
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:58,657
Bro, why did you introduce me
to those guys? They're bad influence.

398
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,562
Aren't you gonna talk to us?

399
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:03,268
Since when have you been
a good boy? Huh?

400
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,704
It's not that.

401
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:09,038
I just thought, once we moved here,
it would be better if me and my mom...

402
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,578
You know... if we...

403
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:12,740
Bonded?

404
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:14,848
To make it up to her?

405
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,685
I'll give you a piece of advice.

406
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:22,924
The reason your mommy is
unable to move on is because...

407
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,358
you still can't get yourself
to forgive her.

408
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:27,186
Think about it.

409
00:36:59,417 --> 00:37:02,489
Hey, brother. How are things?

410
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,294
Good, you finally came home.

411
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:09,560
If mom wakes up and see you
drunk again she'll have a fit.

412
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:16,545
You know, sometimes I think
I should have been the one...

413
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:18,813
in your situation.

414
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:22,250
It hurts too much.

415
00:37:22,673 --> 00:37:24,346
Rommel, what's wrong?

416
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:26,947
Mom really loves you.

417
00:37:27,712 --> 00:37:29,555
She didn't abandon you.

418
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:31,452
That's the truth.

419
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:44,467
Good night, Bro.

420
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:04,556
Oh, that's beautiful.
Who gave these?

421
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,557
They're from Amanda.

422
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:08,296
Amanda?

423
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:11,663
She's outside
waiting for the payment.

424
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:24,475
Amanda?

425
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:27,241
Rommel?

426
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:30,279
Is it really you?

427
00:38:31,776 --> 00:38:34,313
You didn't have a scar
on your forehead before.

428
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:37,590
You're all grown up.

429
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:39,389
You too.

430
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,094
Are you still gardening here?

431
00:38:43,954 --> 00:38:45,558
Not anymore.

432
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:48,968
I sell flowers while waiting
for the next semester.

433
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:54,404
You know, I never forgot about you.

434
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:01,981
Rommel and Amanda
have grandkids now.

435
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:04,284
Wanna see?

436
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:08,456
Sure. Of course, I do.

437
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:16,398
- Amanda.
- Hello.

438
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:19,264
How often do you bring flowers here?

439
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,102
Once a week.

440
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:25,901
Can you deliver everyday?

441
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,634
Really?

442
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:31,736
Sure. Is there a specific
kind of flower you like?

443
00:39:31,802 --> 00:39:35,944
- No, you choose for me.
- Okay. Thank you.

444
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:39,453
So, let's go?
Our grandkids are waiting.

445
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,349
Grandkids?

446
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,490
- Where are you going?
- Not far, mom. Don't worry.

447
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:47,057
We'll be right back.

448
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:53,227
Ask permission properly.

449
00:40:03,467 --> 00:40:08,177
We'll just look at the offspring
of the doves I gave her before.

450
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,013
I won't belong.

451
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:15,916
Don't stay out too late.

452
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:20,255
Let's go.

453
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,904
That's Rommel's first crush, mom.

454
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:41,142
She's the reason Rommel
wanted to be circumcised.

455
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:44,676
Come on! Hurry!
Our grandkids are here.

456
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:50,922
Wow!

457
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:58,697
Look. I kept my promise.

458
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:01,461
I took care of them.

459
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:06,303
Rommel and Amanda's family
has grown, huh?

460
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:13,880
I never thought I'd see you again.

461
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:16,843
I mean them.

462
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:20,053
Me too.

463
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:24,222
Once, Rommel got out.

464
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:27,590
I thought he was gone for good.

465
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:36,465
But I told Amanda,
"Rommel will come back for you.

466
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:39,372
He won't leave you.

467
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:43,402
You'll make many dove children."

468
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:48,610
That afternoon,
Rommel came back.

469
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,986
And there are now
Twenty-seven of them.

470
00:42:59,176 --> 00:43:00,348
Rosa!

471
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,754
Don't do that.

472
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:11,798
Rosa.

473
00:43:19,229 --> 00:43:23,678
Mom. Mom.
Mom, what's wrong?

474
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:30,445
Rommel, I know what happened to her.

475
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,948
She was raped.
Let's help her. Let's save her.

476
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:37,618
- Mom, it's just a nightmare.
- No. Rommel, please believe me.

477
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:40,628
The girl who's been haunting me.
She was raped.

478
00:43:40,684 --> 00:43:43,392
She's asking for help. Rommel!

479
00:43:43,654 --> 00:43:45,133
You are so hard-headed.

480
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:50,872
I told you to drink your medicine.
But you keep forgetting. Here.

481
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:10,617
Rommel, where's your brother?

482
00:44:12,082 --> 00:44:14,688
Can you check on him
before you go to sleep?

483
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:26,305
Mom, lie down and sleep.
You're just tired.

484
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:39,886
Rommel?

485
00:44:43,747 --> 00:44:45,192
I love you.

486
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:48,894
Go to sleep.

487
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:00,404
Good morning, Ma'am.

488
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:05,470
By the Way, I bought candles
for this coming All Souls' Day.

489
00:45:08,038 --> 00:45:12,714
Sir Edu, do you remember
anyone dying here?

490
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:14,050
Why, ma'am?

491
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,889
Nothing.

492
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:18,949
It's just that people say
it is bad luck.

493
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:23,397
It may be why we don't get
a lot of guests in here.

494
00:45:23,454 --> 00:45:26,162
Maybe we need to
have the house blessed.

495
00:45:26,256 --> 00:45:27,132
There was one.

496
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:30,570
A man died of a heart attack
during a birthday party.

497
00:45:30,627 --> 00:45:32,607
But that was long ago.

498
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:35,075
A man? How about women?

499
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:43,015
Ma'am, if you want to know
the history of the pension house...

500
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,952
the previous gardener
knows a lot more.

501
00:45:46,009 --> 00:45:47,420
Sir Pedro.

502
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,236
Anybody ho...

503
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,601
Are you Pedro?

504
00:46:07,197 --> 00:46:08,005
Yes?

505
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:15,912
The pension house is home
to a restless spirit.

506
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:19,446
Or maybe it's trapped.

507
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,316
Just like you.

508
00:46:22,045 --> 00:46:24,025
You always have a guardian,
don't you?

509
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:28,953
I hope one day you'll let it go.

510
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:30,657
So it can rest in peace.

511
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,360
The girl I keep seeing.
Who is she?

512
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:39,301
Do you see her with your eyes
or in your head?

513
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:45,713
Are you just going to psychoanalyze me
or will you answer my question?

514
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:56,556
Back in 1992, a girl was raped
in that pension house.

515
00:46:57,414 --> 00:47:01,920
After that,
death has plagued this place.

516
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:09,931
It is said that the raped girl is
the killer of men who abuse women.

517
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:15,104
Do you know how
to make the ghost leave?

518
00:47:15,732 --> 00:47:19,270
Why would you want to make
an avenger of abused women leave?

519
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:26,114
If there's anyone who has to leave,
it's you and your children.

520
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:28,183
She's giving a Warning.

521
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:31,653
Your son will bring danger.

522
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:36,055
Amiel? Rommel? Which one?

523
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:38,157
What kind of problem?

524
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:40,293
Pedro, what danger?

525
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:42,704
Pedro.

526
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:48,308
Do you know where Rommel is right now?

527
00:48:36,146 --> 00:48:41,146
Amiel. Rommel. Amiel!

528
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:51,703
Rommel!

529
00:49:24,361 --> 00:49:25,738
Mom, what's going on?

530
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:27,834
Mom.

531
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:32,003
Rommel, come here. Hurry.

532
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:43,892
- Are you taking your pills, mom?
- Rommel.

533
00:49:43,947 --> 00:49:46,086
- Wait. I'll get your pills, okay?
- Rommel. Rommel.

534
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:50,160
Rommel, we have to go. Come on.

535
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:53,827
Something here is haunting me.
We need to leave.

536
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:59,166
What's wrong with you?
You're hallucinating again.

537
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:03,377
We just got here and
you're already getting paranoid.

538
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:08,345
Listen to me. Listen.

539
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:13,517
I shouldn't have brought us here.

540
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:17,190
I made a mistake, Rommel.

541
00:50:17,948 --> 00:50:22,761
Why, mom?
Tell me why it's a mistake.

542
00:50:23,787 --> 00:50:26,358
We're in danger here.

543
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:29,764
Something bad is going to happen to us.

544
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:34,203
I feel like our problems are going
to get worse if we stay.

545
00:50:34,798 --> 00:50:36,800
Rommel, listen.

546
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:41,973
Let's go back to Manila for us
and your brother.

547
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,450
Brother?

548
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:45,819
Brother.

549
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:51,149
Where's my brother, mom? Where?

550
00:50:51,948 --> 00:50:55,293
Bro! Where is he?

551
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,430
- Where?
- Upstairs.

552
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,601
He's upstairs.

553
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:07,703
In his room.
Your brother's in his room.

554
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:09,266
Upstairs.

555
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:18,486
Then tell me, mom. Who is he?

556
00:51:22,779 --> 00:51:24,315
Who's this?

557
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:28,154
Eight steps forward. One to the left.

558
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:32,596
Rommel, take care of the luggage
and help your brother too, okay?

559
00:51:35,025 --> 00:51:37,869
Hey, brother. How are things?

560
00:51:38,328 --> 00:51:40,467
Why aren't you in bed?

561
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:45,477
Amiel!

562
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:55,113
Mom, it wasn't Amiel who survived.
It was me!!!

563
00:51:56,046 --> 00:51:59,550
- Survived what?
- The accident!

564
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:05,530
Which one are We going to save?
The one with glasses or the one Without?

565
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:09,193
The one with glasses.
Where's the one with glasses?

566
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:12,272
Amiel.

567
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:14,366
Where's the one with glasses?!

568
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:18,607
Where's the one with glasses?!
Amiel!

569
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:20,443
Give me your hand. Quickly!

570
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:22,609
Give me your hand.
The car's going to fall.

571
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:23,946
Amiel!

572
00:52:24,007 --> 00:52:25,577
Give me your hand, Rommel.

573
00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:27,483
You must live.

574
00:52:28,245 --> 00:52:30,088
- Amiel.
- Rommel.

575
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:35,184
- Amiel.
- Please take care of Mom.

576
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:36,892
- Rommel.
- Amiel.

577
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:38,964
You didn't choose me.

578
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:42,502
But I...

579
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,872
I was the one they saved.

580
00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:56,008
It was Amiel who remained in the van.

581
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:00,582
Who fell off the cliff.

582
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:06,358
Your brother was just with me.

583
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:09,329
- In the car...
- Mom, are we going to keep doing this?

584
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,431
You think you're talking to him
when you're alone.

585
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:16,627
He talks to Nadia.

586
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:21,164
He brings me my jacket,
food, my medicine.

587
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:23,677
That's me!
Me.

588
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:28,038
I've been the one going
to your room every night...

589
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:31,684
bringing you food,
and your sweater.

590
00:53:51,795 --> 00:53:53,934
I was ready to forgive you.

591
00:54:01,304 --> 00:54:03,784
I was ready to forget everything.

592
00:54:11,615 --> 00:54:13,617
I've always been trying to...

593
00:54:20,957 --> 00:54:23,665
because I love you so much, Mom.

594
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:30,675
I love you so much.

595
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:41,956
Why can't you see that?

596
00:54:44,547 --> 00:54:46,618
You don't want to face reality.

597
00:54:50,153 --> 00:54:52,759
Until now,
it's Amiel who is on your mind.

598
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:56,901
You know what?

599
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:02,007
If you don't want to believe me,
I don't care anymore.

600
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:05,444
Rommel. Rommel.

601
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:23,663
Do you think I'd let you get hurt?

602
00:55:29,426 --> 00:55:30,871
Why not?

603
00:55:32,128 --> 00:55:34,130
You've done it before, haven't you?

604
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:38,411
Never.
Rommel.

605
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:22,645
I thought you knew Miss Rosa.

606
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:27,485
I guess I really just wanted
to fool myself that he's still here.

607
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:36,499
You know, Miss Rosa, sometimes you have
to face the truth so you can move on.

608
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:39,301
You don't know
what you're talking about.

609
00:56:39,362 --> 00:56:40,841
It's true.

610
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:43,375
She's right.

611
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:49,613
She's just a kid but she already
knows better than I do.

612
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:56,454
Ma'am, if you want I can ask Edu
to stay here with you.

613
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:59,187
No need. I'll be fine.

614
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:02,287
- Okay then. Good evening. Bye bye.
- Okay, Ma'am. Shall we go.

615
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:03,894
Bye bye.

616
00:57:04,654 --> 00:57:07,999
- We'll head home now.
- Thank you again, Ma'am.

617
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,116
Amiel.

618
00:57:35,018 --> 00:57:36,929
I'm letting you go.

619
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:41,458
I accept it now.

620
00:57:51,067 --> 00:57:53,377
And to the others still here...

621
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:58,817
I hope you find peace.

622
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:05,191
Rommel, you can trust me
if you want to talk about it.

623
00:58:05,248 --> 00:58:07,194
I wish I was the one who died.

624
00:58:08,117 --> 00:58:10,654
I am at fault of Amiel's death.

625
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:12,397
That's not true.

626
00:58:16,259 --> 00:58:20,298
Don't say that, Rommel.

627
00:58:31,474 --> 00:58:34,683
Yo, What's up?

628
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:37,657
Bro, I'm with William.

629
00:58:39,649 --> 00:58:41,492
Hi. How are you?

630
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:45,162
What are you doing here, William?

631
00:58:45,822 --> 00:58:47,324
C'mon. Let's go out.

632
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:49,163
- Game.
- Let's go. Come with us.

633
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:51,136
Wait a minute.
Amanda!

634
00:58:51,227 --> 00:58:54,697
Amanda!
Wait, where are we going?

635
00:58:54,764 --> 00:58:55,936
Don't touch me.

636
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:58,479
- Here. Here.
- Let go of me!

637
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:01,443
- Let go of me!
- Amanda!

638
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:04,846
What's happening?

639
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:06,578
Let me go.

640
00:59:06,643 --> 00:59:09,453
Okay. Okay. You win.

641
00:59:09,512 --> 00:59:12,152
Okay. Alright. Joke time's over, bro.

642
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:16,253
You've scared us.
Let Amanda go home, okay?

643
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:20,426
Man, we're just getting started.

644
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:22,565
Dude, this is too much.

645
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:24,605
We'll all regret this in the morning.

646
00:59:26,763 --> 00:59:28,401
Regret my ass!

647
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,813
Do you know how long I tried
to hook up with Amanda?

648
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:37,775
And you...

649
00:59:40,843 --> 00:59:43,255
you're choosing him over me?!

650
00:59:45,448 --> 00:59:49,260
- Now, I'll show you what you've done.
- Stop!

651
00:59:50,954 --> 00:59:52,194
You son of a bitch!

652
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:54,200
Stop it!

653
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:55,592
You won't listen.

654
00:59:55,992 --> 00:59:58,529
I told you so many times
I don't like you.

655
00:59:59,696 --> 01:00:01,107
You don't like me?

656
01:00:01,164 --> 01:00:03,610
Let's see if you still won't like
what I'm gonna do to you.

657
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:05,410
Amanda!

658
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:08,378
Rommel!

659
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:11,443
Amanda!

660
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:17,258
Stop! Amanda!

661
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:20,385
Where's her cell phone? Where is it?

662
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:25,465
Since Amanda chose you over me,
you get to go first.

663
01:00:26,656 --> 01:00:29,569
It's play time.

664
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:33,938
Let's play. You play or she dies.

665
01:00:33,997 --> 01:00:35,635
Stand up!

666
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:39,836
Give it here.

667
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:45,108
What?

668
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:48,484
What?!

669
01:00:57,553 --> 01:00:59,499
You assholes!

670
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:03,334
Do you really need
to threaten me like that?

671
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:06,369
This is a blessing.

672
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:10,374
- Why would I refuse it?
- That's the spirit!

673
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:13,512
You're too slow. C'mon.

674
01:01:17,306 --> 01:01:19,149
Alright!

675
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:24,118
So fine! Smooth!

676
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,057
This is great, Dude.

677
01:01:26,115 --> 01:01:28,391
Rommel. Rommel, please.

678
01:01:31,387 --> 01:01:35,130
Now, you'll find out
who the real Rommel is.

679
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:43,041
Amanda, Amanda,
I need you to trust me.

680
01:01:43,132 --> 01:01:46,204
When I say run, you run.

681
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:50,615
Run! Run!

682
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:53,353
Get her!

683
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:58,586
Amanda! Amanda!

684
01:02:02,952 --> 01:02:04,260
You asshole!

685
01:02:08,324 --> 01:02:09,098
Rommel?

686
01:02:12,028 --> 01:02:12,972
Rommel?

687
01:02:16,632 --> 01:02:17,576
Pedro?

688
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:20,948
Get out of here, Rosa.

689
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:23,543
Save Rommel.

690
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:25,847
Save the son you have left.

691
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:28,853
You son-of-a-bitch, Glen!

692
01:02:29,979 --> 01:02:31,720
Do you really need
to threaten me like that?

693
01:02:32,148 --> 01:02:35,595
This is a blessing.
Why would I refuse it?

694
01:02:36,018 --> 01:02:36,758
Rommel.

695
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:38,421
That's the spirit!

696
01:02:39,055 --> 01:02:42,400
She looks good. Smooth.
This is perfect!

697
01:02:42,658 --> 01:02:43,693
Rommel, please.

698
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:46,634
Now, you'll find out
who the real Rommel is.

699
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:48,709
You bastard!

700
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:03,355
Hello?

701
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:05,258
Rudolf, Where's Rommel?

702
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:08,721
He didn't come home last night.
Where is he? Is he with you?

703
01:03:11,587 --> 01:03:12,895
Ma'am, I haven't seen him.

704
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:19,774
Rommel, where are you?
Rommel, where are you?

705
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:26,204
Rommel, my son, what happened?

706
01:03:26,969 --> 01:03:29,711
Rommel. Rommel. Rommel!

707
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:33,083
No one says anything to anybody, okay?

708
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:37,187
Hey, Rudolf!
You try anything, you die.

709
01:03:37,246 --> 01:03:38,247
Yeah, you're dead.

710
01:03:39,215 --> 01:03:41,661
No, man. You can trust me.

711
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:18,396
The wound should have been deeper.

712
01:04:20,823 --> 01:04:24,270
But this must have shielded you.

713
01:04:26,429 --> 01:04:29,137
That's Amiel's. Take good care of it.

714
01:04:30,566 --> 01:04:32,568
That saved me two times now.

715
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:37,811
Why were you stabbed?
What did you do last night?

716
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:44,313
I can't remember.

717
01:04:46,482 --> 01:04:48,894
We need to go to
the hospital to treat that.

718
01:04:50,453 --> 01:04:52,729
Won't they ask where
this wound came from?

719
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:56,866
Of course. They'll report it
to the police. Let's go.

720
01:04:57,126 --> 01:05:00,664
Mom. No, Mom.

721
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:02,732
Why?

722
01:05:03,466 --> 01:05:05,468
Did you do something wrong?

723
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:09,372
Mom, I said I don't remember.

724
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:15,250
All I know is I was with William,
Rudolf and Glen.

725
01:05:15,344 --> 01:05:16,379
And Amanda.

726
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:19,918
Did you kill her?

727
01:05:20,783 --> 01:05:23,127
Why would you ask that? No.

728
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:25,858
Mom, I didn't do anything.

729
01:05:26,989 --> 01:05:28,491
Believe me.

730
01:05:45,308 --> 01:05:49,313
Shit. Shit. Shit. What was that?

731
01:05:49,645 --> 01:05:50,680
What?

732
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,315
Insect.

733
01:05:52,581 --> 01:05:56,620
Just an insect.
You're still drunk, aren't you?

734
01:05:59,121 --> 01:06:00,395
Shit!

735
01:06:30,219 --> 01:06:31,562
- William!
- What is it?

736
01:06:33,789 --> 01:06:34,563
William!

737
01:06:39,195 --> 01:06:40,196
Glen!

738
01:06:50,439 --> 01:06:52,851
Good morning, Sergeant.

739
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:57,114
Mrs. Calderon, can we come in?

740
01:06:57,947 --> 01:06:58,823
Sir...

741
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:02,961
We've been investigating
those boys for a long time.

742
01:07:04,420 --> 01:07:07,958
They're suspected of drug use,
drug trafficking and attempted rape.

743
01:07:08,657 --> 01:07:10,864
A Week ago I saw them together.

744
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:17,700
My sources say one of them
is your son, Rommel.

745
01:07:20,136 --> 01:07:22,707
William, Rudolf and Glen
are in those pictures.

746
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:24,984
Friends of your son.

747
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:33,316
Eyewitnesses claim to have seen them
getting into a car with a girl.

748
01:07:35,084 --> 01:07:38,429
Now the girl, Amanda, is missing.

749
01:07:40,156 --> 01:07:48,075
If I'm not mistaken, Amanda's the girl
who delivers flowers here. Right?

750
01:07:50,800 --> 01:07:51,710
Yes.

751
01:07:53,969 --> 01:07:55,880
Do you know where Rommel is?

752
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:01,983
He didn't come home last night.

753
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:08,417
Any texts or calls from him?

754
01:08:10,453 --> 01:08:11,727
Maybe his phone's dead.

755
01:08:12,054 --> 01:08:16,127
All I know is he went back to Manila
to visit the family grave.

756
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:27,273
Sir! Sir, you can't go in.
You don't have a search warrant. Sir!

757
01:08:27,903 --> 01:08:31,146
Ma'am, you don't have dead relatives
in Manila.

758
01:08:32,374 --> 01:08:34,012
Your dead is here.

759
01:08:37,546 --> 01:08:39,548
Your mom? Dad?

760
01:08:44,019 --> 01:08:47,933
Husband and son.
Accident.

761
01:08:54,497 --> 01:08:59,879
Then let us help Rommel and Amanda
so you won't lose him too.

762
01:09:04,106 --> 01:09:05,141
Sir, he's not here.

763
01:09:07,109 --> 01:09:09,214
Sir, the rooms upstairs are empty.

764
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:12,816
I can sue you.

765
01:09:13,382 --> 01:09:15,521
You don't have a warrant.
You know that, right?

766
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:21,897
Sir, it was just called in.

767
01:09:22,758 --> 01:09:26,501
The car in front of the bar
belongs to William Tan.

768
01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:30,340
Plus there are reports of a crime scene unit
dispatched to their condo.

769
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:33,036
One of them is dead. Glen Talabis.

770
01:09:33,469 --> 01:09:36,780
Clean kill. No traceable evidence.

771
01:09:39,475 --> 01:09:40,317
Let's move.

772
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:49,556
We'll be back. I hope, next time,
you have some answers for us.

773
01:09:54,557 --> 01:09:56,093
Reyes, stay here.

774
01:09:56,759 --> 01:09:57,737
Yes, Sir.

775
01:10:02,998 --> 01:10:04,102
Rommel?

776
01:10:26,255 --> 01:10:30,465
This is not real.
Rommel is alive. He's alive.

777
01:10:35,965 --> 01:10:36,875
Hello.

778
01:10:36,932 --> 01:10:39,310
Rudolf. Rudolf, you lied to me.

779
01:10:40,302 --> 01:10:43,749
Tell me the truth.
I know you were with my son last night.

780
01:10:44,006 --> 01:10:45,986
Tell me what happened.

781
01:10:46,475 --> 01:10:47,385
Who told you?

782
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:48,721
Rommel.

783
01:10:49,345 --> 01:10:52,883
Weren't you all together last night?
You, Glen and William.

784
01:10:53,315 --> 01:10:56,524
And now Glen is dead, correct?

785
01:10:57,152 --> 01:10:58,631
Rudolf, listen.

786
01:10:59,955 --> 01:11:03,300
You'll all rot in jail
unless you tell me the truth.

787
01:11:03,525 --> 01:11:05,630
Tell me what happened!

788
01:11:09,965 --> 01:11:11,467
Why don't you ask your son?

789
01:11:12,468 --> 01:11:14,539
He raped and killed Amanda.

790
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:17,714
Go ahead, try to turn us in.

791
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:21,249
You better hide your son
because I'm coming for him.

792
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:26,116
And if you insist on messing with us,
I'll kill you next.

793
01:11:26,582 --> 01:11:28,528
You can't do that to my son.

794
01:11:29,251 --> 01:11:33,996
He didn't do anything, Rudolf.
You can't hurt my son.

795
01:11:36,258 --> 01:11:37,293
Rudolf!

796
01:11:40,095 --> 01:11:41,073
Oh, God.

797
01:11:46,368 --> 01:11:48,507
Dude, Rommel's alive.

798
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:50,748
He was able to talk to his mother.

799
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:52,145
We're dead.

800
01:11:53,676 --> 01:11:56,623
That bastard.
He must have killed Glen.

801
01:11:57,913 --> 01:12:00,723
What? Are you sure?

802
01:12:01,116 --> 01:12:03,619
I don't think Rommel did this.
Have you seen Glen's face?

803
01:12:03,852 --> 01:12:05,160
Must have seen a ghost
or something.

804
01:12:05,387 --> 01:12:06,889
Since when did you believe in ghosts?

805
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:12,839
Where could he have hidden?

806
01:12:15,397 --> 01:12:17,399
Maybe he went to the cops, Bro.

807
01:12:18,067 --> 01:12:19,512
We're dead, man.

808
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:25,946
Then let the cops look for him first.

809
01:12:27,409 --> 01:12:29,855
Here's what you're gonna do.
Here's Amanda's cellphone.

810
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:31,524
Take this to the police station.

811
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:36,161
Why me? You do it.

812
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:40,030
Are you stupid? Don't be a pussy.

813
01:12:41,457 --> 01:12:43,528
I still need to clean the evidence --

814
01:12:44,293 --> 01:12:47,331
Rommel and his mother.
No witnesses.

815
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:50,176
Go.

816
01:12:56,472 --> 01:12:57,382
Dude.

817
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:07,220
Rudolf.

818
01:13:08,183 --> 01:13:10,220
Rudolf.

819
01:13:37,045 --> 01:13:40,515
Hey! Hey! Watch it, asshole!

820
01:13:59,001 --> 01:13:59,979
Ma'am.

821
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:02,107
I thought you left?

822
01:14:02,471 --> 01:14:04,382
They made me stay to watch you.

823
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:07,682
I have something to tell you.

824
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:11,223
Rudolf was just found dead.
Hit-and-run.

825
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:16,559
Ma'am, if you know where your son is,
it's best you turn him over to us.

826
01:14:17,352 --> 01:14:22,028
Because the killer is
targeting all our suspects.

827
01:14:22,558 --> 01:14:24,970
Rommel might be next.

828
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:27,472
My son didn't do anything.

829
01:14:30,499 --> 01:14:31,773
I'm sorry to do this, Ma'am.

830
01:14:32,501 --> 01:14:36,472
But we got this phone
from Rudolf s pocket.

831
01:14:38,307 --> 01:14:40,947
Listen carefully to this
piece of evidence...

832
01:14:41,009 --> 01:14:43,421
connecting your son to all of this.

833
01:14:44,112 --> 01:14:46,058
You son of a bitch, Glen.

834
01:14:47,616 --> 01:14:49,618
Do you really need
to threaten me like that?

835
01:14:50,385 --> 01:14:52,865
This is a blessing.

836
01:14:53,689 --> 01:14:55,168
Why would I refuse it?

837
01:14:58,994 --> 01:15:00,200
You're too slow.

838
01:15:01,463 --> 01:15:07,436
Believe it or not, they're being
murdered by a female ghost.

839
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:11,383
And if your son is a rapist
and a killer, he's next.

840
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:14,382
Better turn in Rommel
so we can protect him.

841
01:15:20,983 --> 01:15:22,121
Rommel.

842
01:15:25,454 --> 01:15:27,229
Sir, with all due respect, sir...

843
01:15:27,756 --> 01:15:29,997
I don't think you shouldn't have
threatened Mrs. Calderon...

844
01:15:30,058 --> 01:15:31,662
to give up his son.

845
01:15:31,727 --> 01:15:33,638
Assuming she is hiding him...

846
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:37,871
we're not even sure he's behind
all of this, are we, Sir?

847
01:15:37,966 --> 01:15:40,503
I wasn't scaring her.

848
01:15:41,069 --> 01:15:44,016
I was giving her a chance
to say goodbye to him...

849
01:15:44,072 --> 01:15:46,575
...because I'm certain
Rommel will be next.

850
01:15:47,509 --> 01:15:48,920
Who's gonna kill him, Sir?

851
01:15:51,713 --> 01:15:55,490
Oh no, Sir!
It might be the ghost, right?

852
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:58,532
The urban legend in this area.

853
01:15:58,587 --> 01:16:00,191
We're doomed, Sir!

854
01:16:01,156 --> 01:16:02,100
Are you mocking me?

855
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:04,568
- You're mocking me?
- Sir. Sir, let go.

856
01:16:11,133 --> 01:16:12,874
Don't go with Jerry.

857
01:16:24,546 --> 01:16:26,048
The other side!

858
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:31,397
Get her!

859
01:17:05,587 --> 01:17:06,497
Sandra!

860
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:11,497
Choose!

861
01:17:13,428 --> 01:17:17,308
Either you come out
or We kill this kid?

862
01:17:20,102 --> 01:17:23,242
Sandra, don't come out.

863
01:17:24,172 --> 01:17:25,150
Shut the hell up!

864
01:17:27,976 --> 01:17:32,447
- Think about it, Sandra.
- Jun.

865
01:17:33,081 --> 01:17:38,155
- Jun.
- One! Two! Three!

866
01:17:38,587 --> 01:17:39,964
- Jun.
- Four!

867
01:17:40,922 --> 01:17:47,771
Five! Six! Seven! Eight!

868
01:17:54,069 --> 01:17:55,548
I knew you'd come out.

869
01:17:55,804 --> 01:17:57,909
You shouldn't have make us run
after you. Save us the trouble.

870
01:18:11,386 --> 01:18:13,366
Please, Jerry!

871
01:18:15,123 --> 01:18:17,729
Jerry, please don't do this.

872
01:18:23,465 --> 01:18:25,843
Stop! Jun.

873
01:18:28,003 --> 01:18:29,414
Jerry!

874
01:18:30,205 --> 01:18:35,621
Let me go! Please, let me go!

875
01:18:40,916 --> 01:18:42,259
I was helpless.

876
01:18:43,151 --> 01:18:44,186
Sir?

877
01:18:46,288 --> 01:18:47,926
Let's search the forest.

878
01:18:51,159 --> 01:18:53,196
I know where we'll find the girl.

879
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:24,729
Son?

880
01:20:42,137 --> 01:20:43,115
Rommel?

881
01:20:58,353 --> 01:20:59,423
Rommel?

882
01:21:09,798 --> 01:21:10,708
Rommel.

883
01:21:13,068 --> 01:21:14,012
Rommel.

884
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:18,340
How is your wound, Rommel?

885
01:21:18,406 --> 01:21:19,817
How did you manage to hide
from the cops?

886
01:21:19,975 --> 01:21:21,386
Big brother helped me.

887
01:21:22,978 --> 01:21:28,951
He blocked all the statues
so the Police wouldn't see me.

888
01:21:32,854 --> 01:21:34,197
Let's go, Rommel.

889
01:21:36,491 --> 01:21:38,596
William might be looking for you.

890
01:21:40,495 --> 01:21:43,601
Rudolf and Glen are gone.

891
01:21:43,999 --> 01:21:47,310
They were killed. You might be next.

892
01:21:49,104 --> 01:21:54,019
I'm innocent. I didn't do anything.

893
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:55,110
Rommel.

894
01:21:57,779 --> 01:22:02,194
Just tell me what really happened...

895
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:09,725
so that I will know what to believe.

896
01:22:11,593 --> 01:22:12,833
Mom.

897
01:22:17,666 --> 01:22:19,668
Don't you love me anymore?

898
01:22:23,338 --> 01:22:26,217
Do I need to get sick?

899
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:37,227
I heard you during the accident...

900
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:44,198
choosing Amiel to be saved.

901
01:22:46,094 --> 01:22:48,540
- Not me.
- That's not true.

902
01:22:50,832 --> 01:22:54,177
When will you choose me?

903
01:22:57,839 --> 01:23:00,342
Rommel, I didn't choose.

904
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:04,517
I never chose
between the two of you.

905
01:23:04,579 --> 01:23:08,459
I love you both as your mother.

906
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:18,131
That day, I called for him first
since I was used to...

907
01:23:18,994 --> 01:23:23,067
taking care of him first because...

908
01:23:23,765 --> 01:23:30,410
I blamed myself for his blindness.

909
01:23:32,140 --> 01:23:34,416
But you, Rommel...

910
01:23:34,476 --> 01:23:40,222
you were always so loving.

911
01:23:40,281 --> 01:23:44,696
I always expected you
to understand.

912
01:23:45,487 --> 01:23:51,597
I never realized I was neglecting you.
I didn't know.

913
01:23:52,394 --> 01:23:55,500
I'm sorry, Son.

914
01:23:56,798 --> 01:24:00,245
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

915
01:24:03,405 --> 01:24:06,545
Please, forgive you mother.

916
01:24:18,219 --> 01:24:19,857
I'm also sorry, Mom.

917
01:24:31,332 --> 01:24:35,747
Mom, we need to find Amanda.

918
01:24:39,174 --> 01:24:40,653
All right.

919
01:24:43,311 --> 01:24:44,619
Come on.

920
01:24:50,018 --> 01:24:53,989
Just a little further, son.
Let's just get past the Police Officer.

921
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:03,137
Mom. Mom. I remember now.

922
01:25:03,598 --> 01:25:06,772
I didn't want to join them.

923
01:25:07,335 --> 01:25:09,372
But Glen had a knife on me.

924
01:25:10,271 --> 01:25:14,378
Amanda...
I left Amanda in the forest.

925
01:25:17,745 --> 01:25:19,349
Okay, we'll find her.

926
01:25:20,148 --> 01:25:21,525
He's turned around.

927
01:25:23,785 --> 01:25:24,923
Let's go.

928
01:25:37,332 --> 01:25:39,835
- Come on, son.
- Here, mom. This is it.

929
01:25:41,236 --> 01:25:44,410
I know Amanda's here.
I can feel it.

930
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:47,784
She's been here for over a day.

931
01:25:47,842 --> 01:25:51,483
We need to find help.
I'll call for an ambulance.

932
01:25:53,248 --> 01:25:54,659
No signal.

933
01:25:58,219 --> 01:25:59,857
Rommel, there's no signal.

934
01:26:00,688 --> 01:26:04,101
Mom, you need to go home.
Go and ask for help.

935
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:09,700
- I'm not leaving you like this.
- Mom, mom, mom. I got this.

936
01:26:10,064 --> 01:26:12,874
Amanda needs us, Mom.

937
01:26:12,934 --> 01:26:15,676
I can't. I can't leave you, Rommel.

938
01:26:16,504 --> 01:26:18,916
Stay here.

939
01:26:33,688 --> 01:26:38,296
- Rommel! Rommel!
- Mom, I'll be fine. Go home.

940
01:26:38,359 --> 01:26:40,965
Call for help. it'll be alright.

941
01:26:41,896 --> 01:26:43,273
Be careful, mom.

942
01:26:51,639 --> 01:26:52,913
Amanda!

943
01:27:09,390 --> 01:27:10,869
Amanda!

944
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:15,230
Amanda!

945
01:27:39,087 --> 01:27:40,828
Brother, please help me.

946
01:27:51,699 --> 01:27:55,340
Rommel. Let's practice.

947
01:27:57,005 --> 01:28:01,715
Fifteen steps forward.
Three to the left.

948
01:28:04,612 --> 01:28:05,989
Thank you.

949
01:28:08,583 --> 01:28:09,960
Thank you, brother.

950
01:28:45,853 --> 01:28:47,355
Please don't die on me.

951
01:28:56,464 --> 01:28:57,272
Rommel.

952
01:28:58,966 --> 01:29:00,104
Rommel.

953
01:29:01,669 --> 01:29:03,615
Rommel, show yourself.

954
01:29:05,106 --> 01:29:06,551
Stop hiding.

955
01:29:11,813 --> 01:29:12,917
Amanda!

956
01:29:14,982 --> 01:29:17,588
Amanda. Amanda. Amanda.

957
01:29:19,287 --> 01:29:22,097
Amanda. Amanda.

958
01:29:22,957 --> 01:29:27,565
Amanda. Amanda.
Amanda, wake up! it's Rommel.

959
01:29:30,198 --> 01:29:31,700
Amanda.

960
01:29:36,604 --> 01:29:39,710
- Amanda.
- Rommel.

961
01:29:42,276 --> 01:29:44,017
You came back for me.

962
01:29:48,716 --> 01:29:52,425
I can't move.

963
01:29:57,225 --> 01:29:59,728
You're bleeding, Rommel.

964
01:30:03,631 --> 01:30:05,167
Just leave me.

965
01:30:05,233 --> 01:30:09,545
- I will not leave you, Amanda.
- Please, go. Save yourself.

966
01:30:09,604 --> 01:30:11,811
Rommel didn't leave Amanda.

967
01:30:12,774 --> 01:30:17,723
They grew old and
had many children, remember?

968
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:20,116
Twenty-seven kids.

969
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:25,163
Can you take that? Huh?

970
01:30:28,656 --> 01:30:33,332
Amanda. Amanda!
Amanda, wake up! Amanda!

971
01:30:35,863 --> 01:30:37,274
Sir, somebody's in there.

972
01:30:39,033 --> 01:30:40,205
Help!

973
01:30:40,968 --> 01:30:45,075
Sir, please help us!
Sir! Please!

974
01:30:46,007 --> 01:30:50,149
- Get away from there!
- Sir, I'm innocent.

975
01:30:50,211 --> 01:30:51,849
Sir, we need help.

976
01:30:51,913 --> 01:30:55,383
- Sir, please, help us.
- Check the girl. Go.

977
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:00,926
Sir, she's alive.

978
01:31:02,723 --> 01:31:04,828
- We need your help.
- Call an ambulance. Quickly!

979
01:31:05,193 --> 01:31:06,194
Yes, Sir.

980
01:31:09,030 --> 01:31:10,668
Amanda. Amanda.

981
01:31:25,379 --> 01:31:26,517
Rommel!

982
01:31:30,718 --> 01:31:35,758
Rommel! Show yourself.

983
01:31:36,757 --> 01:31:38,134
Rommel, come out!

984
01:31:38,559 --> 01:31:41,768
Sir, thank you for responding
quickly to my mother's call.

985
01:31:41,829 --> 01:31:43,240
Thank you.

986
01:31:43,297 --> 01:31:45,072
Your mother didn't call me.

987
01:31:45,933 --> 01:31:48,311
Aren't you friends with William?
Where is he?

988
01:31:48,469 --> 01:31:50,210
Sir, he's not my friend.

989
01:31:50,404 --> 01:31:52,543
Sir, he's behind all of this.

990
01:31:55,810 --> 01:31:58,381
Reyes? Reyes, what's your status?

991
01:31:58,646 --> 01:32:03,288
Reyes, What's your status?

992
01:32:10,658 --> 01:32:12,569
Sir, what's going on?

993
01:32:12,627 --> 01:32:13,833
Reyes isn't answering.

994
01:32:13,895 --> 01:32:16,136
Bring them to the hospital.
I'll go to the pension house. Go.

995
01:32:16,797 --> 01:32:17,639
Hold on!

996
01:32:28,376 --> 01:32:33,553
Rosa.
Where are you going?

997
01:32:34,248 --> 01:32:36,250
I'm coming to get you.

998
01:32:36,851 --> 01:32:38,694
Rosa.

999
01:33:11,319 --> 01:33:13,299
- Please hand me the gauze.
- She's going into shock!

1000
01:33:13,588 --> 01:33:14,658
Sedate her.

1001
01:33:31,439 --> 01:33:35,444
Rosa, stop hiding Rommel.

1002
01:33:37,011 --> 01:33:38,854
Where is your son?

1003
01:33:44,785 --> 01:33:46,662
Sir, please don't move.

1004
01:33:47,722 --> 01:33:50,669
Please don't move.

1005
01:33:54,095 --> 01:33:56,541
- I need you to steady, Sir.
- Hello.

1006
01:33:56,597 --> 01:34:00,739
Hello, mom?
I'm with Amanda now.

1007
01:34:01,502 --> 01:34:02,412
She's still alive.

1008
01:34:03,004 --> 01:34:05,109
But We need to bring her
to the hospital.

1009
01:34:05,973 --> 01:34:08,920
- Hello, Mom? Mom?
- Rommel...

1010
01:34:09,677 --> 01:34:11,987
Rommel, William is here.

1011
01:34:13,781 --> 01:34:17,593
Sir. Sir. Sir, we need to go back.
My mom's in trouble. Please.

1012
01:34:17,652 --> 01:34:19,188
No, Rommel.

1013
01:34:19,587 --> 01:34:21,828
- Turn around, please.
- No, Rommel. Don't come back.

1014
01:34:21,989 --> 01:34:26,870
- Sir, my mom will die, please.
- You are not going back here, Rommel!

1015
01:34:27,395 --> 01:34:28,635
Don't come back.

1016
01:34:28,729 --> 01:34:30,333
Your mom or your girlfriend?

1017
01:34:30,398 --> 01:34:34,175
- You're still bleeding. It's not good.
- Son. My Son, listen to me.

1018
01:34:34,635 --> 01:34:38,708
You will not come back here.
You don't have to choose.

1019
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:41,577
Just go straight to the hospital.

1020
01:34:42,410 --> 01:34:43,753
I'll handle this.

1021
01:34:44,945 --> 01:34:47,084
You will never be able to run
to the Police now!

1022
01:34:47,248 --> 01:34:48,556
I love you.

1023
01:34:51,886 --> 01:34:53,126
I love you, mom.

1024
01:34:54,121 --> 01:34:55,293
Open the door!

1025
01:35:07,668 --> 01:35:09,511
Do you think you can escape me?

1026
01:35:16,977 --> 01:35:20,015
Stand up!
Where's Rommel? Stand up!

1027
01:35:20,081 --> 01:35:21,685
You bitch!
You just had to mess with me.

1028
01:35:21,749 --> 01:35:23,854
- Where's your son?
-I don't know!

1029
01:35:23,984 --> 01:35:24,758
You don't know?

1030
01:35:30,291 --> 01:35:32,271
- Stand up!
- Let me go.

1031
01:35:32,326 --> 01:35:33,669
I said stand up.

1032
01:35:34,261 --> 01:35:35,365
Where is Rommel?

1033
01:35:47,808 --> 01:35:48,878
Ma'am.

1034
01:35:55,716 --> 01:35:56,694
Thank you.

1035
01:36:02,923 --> 01:36:06,370
Sarge? Sarge!

1036
01:37:07,688 --> 01:37:10,430
Don't. Please.

1037
01:37:12,226 --> 01:37:18,768
No. Don't.

1038
01:37:18,833 --> 01:37:22,906
Have mercy. Please, William.

1039
01:37:23,003 --> 01:37:27,418
No!

1040
01:38:21,462 --> 01:38:23,635
Ma'am, have a safe trip.

1041
01:38:24,131 --> 01:38:25,872
- Be safe, Ma'am.
- Mom, shall we go?

1042
01:38:25,933 --> 01:38:28,072
You inspired me to go back to school.

1043
01:38:28,402 --> 01:38:32,817
Aww, you. Don't drive too fast, okay?
Have a safe trip.

1044
01:38:35,075 --> 01:38:37,021
Okay, I promise.

1045
01:38:50,391 --> 01:38:51,495
Mom.

1046
01:39:20,721 --> 01:39:21,961
Mom, let's go!

1047
01:39:22,022 --> 01:39:23,524
- Let's go!
- Goodbye. Bye bye.

1048
01:39:23,590 --> 01:39:25,399
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.

1049
01:39:25,859 --> 01:39:30,535
- Take care.
- Bye!
