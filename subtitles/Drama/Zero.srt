1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,900
Yes?

2
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,230
Good morning.

3
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,831
Have you decided?

4
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,754
Yes.

5
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,556
Field work, bugging, photos.

6
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,950
You pay whatever the result.

7
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,998
And double if you need evidence in court.

8
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,636
I don't need it.

9
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,873
Just a moment.

10
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,233
OK.

11
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,398
Shall we get started, then?

12
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,919
Yes.

13
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,799
When can I expect something?

14
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,279
Hard to say.

15
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,557
A week or 2.
A day if it's clear cut.

16
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,392
Call me at the same time or late at night.

17
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,460
OK.

18
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,593
But, you realize...

19
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,397
Please.

20
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,108
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

21
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,914
Later. We've got a better job.

22
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,755
This guy's in a hurry.
He's paying 7K

23
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,196
And when it's all over
we get the fuck out.

24
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,953
What's going on?

25
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,193
Hey, you there.

26
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,235
2.50--

27
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,874
OK.

28
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,269
Can I give you a flyer?

29
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,834
OK.

30
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,759
- What's going on up there?
- Someone shot a red light.

31
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,037
- Any bodies?
- I don't think so.

32
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,992
We're moving.

33
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,358
Thank you, goodbye.

34
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,715
- How much?
- 2.50--

35
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,715
Can I give you a flyer?

36
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,829
OK. Here's 5.

37
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,993
- Thank you very much.
- Thanks.

38
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,792
Life...

39
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,630
That's the way it is.
People drive like maniacs.

40
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,119
I see it all the time.

41
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,353
A bit of clear road and they're doing 100.

42
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,515
Do you know how much fuel they burn?

43
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,639
Must be a lot.

44
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,517
You bet. And it costs.

45
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,070
I converted the car to autogas.

46
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,877
But does it run any worse? No.

47
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,997
Sure.

48
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,230
But it's not all the same.

49
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:10,194
Sometimes, when I buy
more expensive gas,

50
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,157
the car goes like a rocket.

51
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,278
Like a rocket.

52
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,194
I can do 100 in third, no problem.

53
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,915
Stop here on the right. By the entrance.

54
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,999
OK.

55
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,314
Here's the card.

56
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,473
24-48.

57
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,918
Don't write down the route.

58
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,273
There you go.

59
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,953
Have a nice day.

60
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,476
Thank you. Same to you.

61
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,391
Again? It'll kill you.

62
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,434
What were you saying?

63
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,160
That you should forget him.
I think he's seeing someone.

64
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,437
- Mum, what are you saying?
- You caught him lying.

65
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,879
I'm sure those "meetings" are dates.

66
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,789
Mum please, that's just his job.

67
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,878
Wait a moment.

68
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,999
I think we've found a donor
for the little boy in room 3.

69
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,918
I have to go, sweetie.

70
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,679
Alright. Bye.

71
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,980
Bye.

72
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,950
There was an accident.

73
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,193
A father and son. The son's
chances are slim, so...

74
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,390
This is him.

75
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:30,272
He's been here a month. He's not insured.

76
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,715
Fine. We'll need the agreement
of the donor's parents.

77
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,710
His parents need 14,000.

78
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,996
- But that's impossible.
- What do you mean?

79
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,675
They're very poor...

80
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,149
So is the hospital, dear.

81
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,229
Can't something be done?

82
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,989
Well. I can speak to the director.

83
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,390
- But half that sum is the minimum.
- Right, right.

84
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,836
- How's he doing?
- Not good.

85
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,198
- Are they ready?
- Yes.

86
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,835
Faster!

87
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,997
Out of the way!

88
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,830
- You're not allowed in here.
- I lost my way.

89
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,072
- How do I get out?
- There, down the stairs.

90
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,273
Sorry.

91
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,229
Yes?

92
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,757
Where the fuck are you?

93
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,673
I had to... had to sort something out...

94
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,595
What?

95
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,875
I...

96
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,319
Get here!

97
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,631
- I called her.
- Yeah?

98
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,712
Back to work. Spit roast her.

99
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,831
OK. I'm turning on the lights.

100
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,630
- After you.
- Thank you.

101
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,398
Hello.

102
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,075
What?

103
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,236
- Hello.
- Hello.

104
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,676
11.50.

105
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,592
There you go.

106
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,356
I'm not taking that.

107
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,238
- Why?
- It's ripped.

108
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,916
- But I haven't got...
- I don't care.

109
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,038
- But it's fine, it's from another shop.
- Take it back then.

110
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,435
But...

111
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,315
Too bad.

112
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,555
Leave it!

113
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,435
Give it to me.

114
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,798
Is this one good enough?

115
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,516
Thank you. All the best.

116
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,035
No problem. Good bye.

117
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,955
Have you got any more bags?

118
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,755
This one's broken.

119
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,592
Thank you. How much is that?

120
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,432
45.

121
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,678
Have a good day.

122
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,629
Careful, mind where you're going.

123
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,678
- What are you doing?
- I'm so sorry.

124
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,740
Kids.

125
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,273
- Come on.
- Sorry, do you live here?

126
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,519
Yes, on the top floor.

127
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,079
On your own?

128
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,512
No, with my husband and son.

129
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,871
My son's in hospital,
we're just off to visit him.

130
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,398
- What's the matter with him?
- He's waiting for a transplant.

131
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,311
I don't know if he'll make it.

132
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,189
Even then it costs a lot of money.

133
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,234
I'm from the Our Children Foundation.

134
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,475
Here's my card.

135
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,749
Get your husband to call
me today around 11 pm.

136
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,552
Maybe we can do something.

137
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,118
Thank you very much.
My husband will call for sure.

138
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,798
Sorry, have you got a cigarette?

139
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,600
I don't smoke. Goodbye.

140
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,314
Thank you.

141
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,594
Don't stare.

142
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,277
Look out, stupid!

143
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,954
But it's green.

144
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,034
It doesn't matter.

145
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,749
Morons. Jaywalkers.

146
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,191
It's my right of way too.

147
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,311
She wasn't looking.

148
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,311
Move!

149
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:32,111
And with a kid.

150
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,041
I was strict with my boy

151
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,751
and he turned out alright.

152
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:46,752
He's at university. He's smart.

153
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,956
Do you have any children?

154
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,474
Yes, I do.

155
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,954
It's here.

156
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,309
OK.

157
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,550
How much?

158
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,798
22.

159
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,118
Here's thirty.

160
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,159
Thank you very much.

161
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,509
Have a nice day.

162
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,988
Same to you.

163
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,348
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

164
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,910
We're checking the electrics,
there's a leak, can we come in?

165
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,637
- Will it take long?
- No.

166
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,398
Go check that one.

167
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,310
Have you had any problems?

168
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,108
No, not really.

169
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,318
- Are you the owner?
- No, I rent it.

170

I can't see anything here.

173
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,715

call the owner.

175
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,033
Nothing here, have you got anything?

176
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,793
We'll be going then.

177
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,149
Sorry to bother you.

178

183
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,675
They're ready.

00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,635
Have a listen.

185
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,915
Open the door please!

186
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,515
There's a leak!

00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,989
You've got a leak.

188
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,513
We need to disconnect the mains.

189
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,153
Please sit down! We need room.

190
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,829

Now what?
It's done.

193
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,352
What was the problem?

194
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,272
We bypassed it.

195
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:16,632
Sorry, but that's our job. Goodbye.

196

What the fuck was that?

00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,918
Electricians.

199
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,508
They were here earlier.

200
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,268
So why'd you let them in again?

201
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,868
Say "Hi" from me.

202
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,580

209
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,998
She had something to do.

I don't know.

You're having an abortion.

291

I don't want to!

292
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,670
Why should I lose money just
because some cunt was careless!

293
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,759
I wasn't.

294

In the parking lot.

341
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,992
Did you call the police?

342
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,669
Are you kidding?
He was a fucking gangster

343
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,150
I don't want a bullet in the head.

344
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,358
But you're OK, aren't you?

345
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,954
Yeah, fortunately I'm OK.

346
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:17,717
Have you finished for the day?

347
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,836
Maybe we could go out somewhere or...

348
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,919
Don't think so, I've got a report to write.

349
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,509
OK, I understand.

350
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,319
Maybe we can eat at home?
I'll buy some wine.

351
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,755
Yeah, alright...

352
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:42,032
Maybe I'll make some
pasta and a salad and...

353
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,509
Sure, bye.

354
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,518
Love you, bye.

355
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,274
Do you want a sip?

356
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,114
You better go home, your wife's waiting.

357
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,516
I've still got some stuff to do.

358
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:04,308
You're all the same.

359
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,471
The same as what?

360
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,554
Yes or no?

361
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,878
Hang on a sec.

362
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,668
- Coming for a drink?
- Sure.

363
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,400
- 15 minutes?
- OK.

364
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:02,394
How about it?
