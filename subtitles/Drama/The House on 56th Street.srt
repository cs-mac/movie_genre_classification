1
00:01:06,393 --> 00:01:09,056
Oh there you are, a sight for sore eyes.
- A sight for sore feet you mean.

2
00:01:09,244 --> 00:01:12,153
Right you are. Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Spike. See you tomorrow.

3
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:29,159
Good evening, Mr Fiske.
- Good evening.

4
00:02:23,604 --> 00:02:24,708
Which one is Peggy?

5
00:02:25,196 --> 00:02:26,383
The third from the left.

6
00:03:47,668 --> 00:03:49,897
Monte, she's a peach of a girl.
- I thought you'd like her.

7
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:51,413
Will she join us after the show?

8
00:03:51,544 --> 00:03:53,389
U don't know.
- Why don't you send her a note?

9
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:54,451
I intend to.

10
00:03:54,749 --> 00:03:55,965
Perhaps she has a friend?

11
00:03:56,247 --> 00:03:58,064
That little blond on
her left was not so bad.

12
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,259
And the dark one on her right
and he redhead was alright.

13
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:03,445
As a matter of fact they're all alright.
- Let's go.

14
00:04:03,545 --> 00:04:05,304
Of course, none of them
compare with Peggy.

15
00:04:16,213 --> 00:04:17,708
David said every ticket is sold.

16
00:04:17,908 --> 00:04:19,475
Lyndon Fiske is out there again.

17
00:04:19,575 --> 00:04:20,783
Yep, for the 80th time.

18
00:04:21,072 --> 00:04:23,176
He and Monte Van Tyle should
know the show backwards.

19
00:04:23,276 --> 00:04:24,970
You certainly draw them in, Peggy.

20
00:04:25,186 --> 00:04:26,202
Yes, both of them.

21
00:04:26,359 --> 00:04:27,741
[ Female scream! ]

22
00:04:27,951 --> 00:04:28,997
What's eating you?

23
00:04:29,097 --> 00:04:31,744
Peggy, a buckle's killing me. See if
you can pull it out for me, will you.

24
00:04:31,844 --> 00:04:34,209
Well Peggy, which is it to be?
Fiske or Van Tyle?

25
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,535
I wish I knew.

26
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:38,096
I think you're crazy if you
throw Fiske over.         - Think so?

27
00:04:38,196 --> 00:04:41,310
I know so. The older ones are
safer .. if you know what I mean.

28
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:43,871
But Monte Van Tyle is very good looking.

29
00:04:44,181 --> 00:04:45,496
And very, very rich.

30
00:04:45,596 --> 00:04:47,772
So one day you'll get married
and then where will you be?

31
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:49,439
23 Skidoo. Ouch!

32
00:04:50,019 --> 00:04:51,550
Can't you get that thing?
- Almost.

33
00:04:52,033 --> 00:04:54,728
You know, every time I look out of
that box and see Monte there ..

34
00:04:54,969 --> 00:04:56,431
My heart skips a couple of beats.

35
00:04:56,761 --> 00:04:59,175
Does Fiske know about Monte Van Tyle?
- There's nothing to know.

36
00:04:59,275 --> 00:05:00,664
Uhuh?
- No, there isn't.

37
00:05:00,845 --> 00:05:01,925
Ouch!
- Wait.

38
00:05:02,662 --> 00:05:03,791
It is also difficult.

39
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,267
I don't want to hurt Lyndon. But on the
other hand I don't want Monte to feel ..

40
00:05:07,367 --> 00:05:08,818
Oh no dear. You want them both.

41
00:05:09,004 --> 00:05:10,027
Perfectly natural.

42
00:05:10,303 --> 00:05:12,278
You know if were you, I'd simply ..
- There it is!

43
00:05:13,018 --> 00:05:14,062
Hand me that thing.

44
00:05:18,021 --> 00:05:19,681
What will you have, Sefton?
- Bourbon.

45
00:05:19,988 --> 00:05:20,832
Make it two.

46
00:05:21,508 --> 00:05:23,387
Have you a pencil?
I'll scribble Peggy a note.

47
00:05:23,487 --> 00:05:24,978
Yes. Don't forget to tell her.

48
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,472
One for the college friend.

49
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:28,165
In from the country to see the sights.

50
00:05:28,722 --> 00:05:30,626
Good evening, Tom.
- Good evening, Mr Fiske.

51
00:05:31,196 --> 00:05:33,205
Why hello, Monte.
- Good evening, Lyndon.

52
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:34,662
Mr Fiske. Sefton Hunt.

53
00:05:35,015 --> 00:05:36,431
How do you do.
- How do you do.

54
00:05:36,596 --> 00:05:38,792
Are you seeing the show?
- Oh, yes indeed.

55
00:05:38,991 --> 00:05:39,840
Enjoying it?

56
00:05:40,929 --> 00:05:42,066
I always do.

57
00:05:42,548 --> 00:05:43,486
Always do?

58
00:05:43,695 --> 00:05:44,854
You must be like Monte.

59
00:05:44,961 --> 00:05:47,060
He's seen the show .. how
many times is it, Monte?

60
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,560
Twenty-eight.
- Twenty-eight?

61
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,528
My record is thirty.
- Thirty?

62
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,214
I'm two up on you, Monte.

63
00:05:52,484 --> 00:05:54,325
Well .. all I can say is ..

64
00:05:54,553 --> 00:05:56,179
If your reason is as good as Monte's.

65
00:05:56,603 --> 00:05:58,207
Here is to your reason.
- Thank you.

66
00:05:58,307 --> 00:05:59,758
Monte. Here is to your reason.

67
00:05:59,858 --> 00:06:00,720
Mr Fiske.

68
00:06:00,942 --> 00:06:03,045
I wouldn't be indiscreet
enough to ask which one it is.

69
00:06:03,361 --> 00:06:06,437
But I hope it isn't the
second blond on the right.

70
00:06:10,254 --> 00:06:13,187
Come on, Monte. We'd better be going if
we're going to get that note back stage.

71
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,647
Happy to meet you, Mr Fiske.
- Thank you.

72
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:22,934
Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

73
00:06:23,177 --> 00:06:24,831
Goodnight, Monte.
- Goodnight, Lyndon.

74
00:06:24,931 --> 00:06:26,846
Remember me to your mother.
- Thanks. I will.

75
00:06:27,285 --> 00:06:29,327
Your last chance ladies and
gentlemen. Last chance.

76
00:06:29,427 --> 00:06:31,433
Now watch closely, it's all
so simple. Which one?

77
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:32,978
Come on, which one will you have?

78
00:06:33,078 --> 00:06:34,489
That one!
- This one?

79
00:06:34,589 --> 00:06:35,604
No! The other one.

80
00:06:38,697 --> 00:06:40,399
There is that one,
and there is that one.

81
00:06:43,884 --> 00:06:45,591
You're wasting your time in the chorus.

82
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,737
If I could handle cards like
you do, I'd do it for a living.

83
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,905
My grandfather managed
to make a living at it.

84
00:06:51,504 --> 00:06:53,120
Then they caught him holding five aces.

85
00:06:53,518 --> 00:06:55,022
He died .. lead poisoning.

86
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:58,070
I learned everything from my father.
He could make cards talk.

87
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,880
Was your father really a gambler
on the riverboats?         - Hmm.

88
00:07:01,104 --> 00:07:02,520
And did you used to go with him?

89
00:07:02,772 --> 00:07:04,061
Of course it was a come-on.

90
00:07:04,334 --> 00:07:05,893
Then one day they caught up with him.

91
00:07:06,312 --> 00:07:08,841
Why, I still love cards but,
the chorus is safer.

92
00:07:09,672 --> 00:07:11,489
Card for Peggy Martin
and he wants an answer.

93
00:07:16,816 --> 00:07:17,517
Thanks.

94
00:07:35,006 --> 00:07:36,903
Take my advice and stick to Lyndon.

95
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:41,160
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

96
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,928
I couldn't if I wanted to.
It isn't in the cards.

97
00:07:44,231 --> 00:07:45,332
Hey, you dropped one.

98
00:07:45,988 --> 00:07:46,714
Wow.

99
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:48,185
The ace of spades.

100
00:07:48,679 --> 00:07:51,462
Gee, I'm glad it didn't turn up in those
four. I wouldn't go out with anyone.

101
00:07:52,152 --> 00:07:53,196
Say, give me that.

102
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,361
Hey, hurry up. You're holding
up the second act curtain.

103
00:08:12,222 --> 00:08:13,916
Hello Lyndon.
- Good evening, my dear.

104
00:08:14,081 --> 00:08:16,161
Did I keep you waiting?
- Not at all.     - Good.

105
00:08:16,739 --> 00:08:17,645
Sherrys.

106
00:08:25,349 --> 00:08:26,736
Are you worried about anything?

107
00:08:26,994 --> 00:08:28,481
No. No, not at all.

108
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,594
That's fine.

109
00:08:30,361 --> 00:08:32,967
I know of no-one who has less
to worry about. Thanks to you.

110
00:08:34,073 --> 00:08:35,289
That's very sweet of you.

111
00:08:36,893 --> 00:08:38,819
I've arranged a very
nice party for tonight.

112
00:08:46,111 --> 00:08:48,863
How many times have you seen the play?
- Children .. children!

113
00:08:49,393 --> 00:08:51,232
How about a toast, mister Fiske?
- Alright.

114
00:08:51,552 --> 00:08:52,739
I'll give you a new one.

115
00:08:52,869 --> 00:08:54,837
Here's to the ladies. God bless them.

116
00:08:55,362 --> 00:08:56,646
We can't live with them.

117
00:08:57,281 --> 00:08:58,668
And we can't live without them.

118
00:09:00,153 --> 00:09:02,101
But there are exceptions to the rule.
- Oh yes.

119
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:03,193
And ..

120
00:09:03,775 --> 00:09:06,708
You are the exception,
Miss Peggy Martin.

121
00:09:08,602 --> 00:09:10,513
You know, you are looking
very lovely tonight.

122
00:09:10,613 --> 00:09:12,583
I must .. my hair is probably a sight.

123
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:13,979
Quite ravishing.

124
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:15,619
Just the same, I think I'll fix it.

125
00:09:15,719 --> 00:09:18,040
I didn't have time in the dressing
room. Will you excuse me?

126
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,028
Of course.

127
00:09:19,215 --> 00:09:21,347
I think I'll go with you, Peggy.
- Come along, Dolly.

128
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,641
We'll be right back.

129
00:09:26,236 --> 00:09:27,280
Paging Miss Martin.

130
00:09:29,534 --> 00:09:30,435
See you later.

131
00:09:30,908 --> 00:09:32,267
I'll be right with you, Dolly.

132
00:09:32,726 --> 00:09:35,035
Monte, you shouldn't follow me here.
- What else could I do?

133
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:37,128
I heard the cleverest limerick today.

134
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,387
Really? Let's hear it.
- I don't know that I should.

135
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:42,190
Oh come on, let's hear it.
- It's terribly naughty.

136
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:43,788
Now I <i>know </i>we should hear it.

137
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,021
There was an old maid from Nantucket.

138
00:09:46,121 --> 00:09:48,140
Yes, go on.
- See if I can remember the rest of it.

139
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,382
I had to see you.

140
00:09:49,482 --> 00:09:51,116
If you'd told me sooner,
I may have arranged it.

141
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:53,450
Something very important.
- Nothing serious, I hope.

142
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,969
Very.
- What is it, Monte?

143
00:09:58,682 --> 00:09:59,497
I love you.

144
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,472
You should be slapped for
scaring a girl to death like that.

145
00:10:05,234 --> 00:10:07,040
He came up behind her and took it.

146
00:10:07,904 --> 00:10:11,384
"He came up behind her and took it."
Ha ha. I must remember that.

147
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,804
Oh, that's corking.

148
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,024
What's the matter, Mr Fiske?
Didn't you think it was funny?

149
00:10:25,022 --> 00:10:25,666
What?

150
00:10:25,984 --> 00:10:28,086
Oh yes, yes. Very, very funny.

151
00:10:28,859 --> 00:10:29,560
Waiter.

152
00:10:29,765 --> 00:10:31,152
Let's have some more champagne.

153
00:10:31,252 --> 00:10:35,139
Darling, consider yourself closely held
in my arms and very thoroughly kissed.

154
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,726
You do pick the strangest places.
- Embarrassed?

155
00:10:39,036 --> 00:10:40,723
Of course.
- That's great.

156
00:10:41,434 --> 00:10:42,177
Idiot.

157
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,193
When am I going to see you?
Tomorrow night?

158
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,220
I really shouldn't.

159
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:47,917
We'll go for a drive in the park.

160
00:10:48,692 --> 00:10:49,650
Oh, I'd love it.

161
00:10:49,837 --> 00:10:51,206
Well, say you will, then.

162
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:54,716
Alright.

163
00:10:56,224 --> 00:10:57,787
Goodnight, dear.
- Goodnight, dear.

164
00:10:58,296 --> 00:10:59,312
Oh and by the way.

165
00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:02,141
Perhaps you'd better consider
yourself thoroughly kissed again.

166
00:11:02,971 --> 00:11:03,721
Monte.

167
00:11:13,224 --> 00:11:14,319
Then you do love me.

168
00:11:14,546 --> 00:11:16,248
You know I do.
- That's all that matters.

169
00:11:16,874 --> 00:11:17,603
Darling.

170
00:11:21,224 --> 00:11:22,493
I could be so happy if ..

171
00:11:22,869 --> 00:11:23,598
If what?

172
00:11:23,761 --> 00:11:25,721
If I didn't feel that I were
hurting someone else.

173
00:11:25,926 --> 00:11:26,666
Fiske?

174
00:11:26,766 --> 00:11:29,211
He doesn't deserve to be hurt, Monte.
He's been too good to me.

175
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,788
Sometimes we have to hurt other
people to gain our own happiness.

176
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,704
But I am so happy.

177
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:35,928
Let's never mention Fiske again.
Promise me.

178
00:11:36,219 --> 00:11:36,979
Dearest.

179
00:11:37,503 --> 00:11:40,783
I am so utterly and completely yours,
you need never think of him again.

180
00:11:43,059 --> 00:11:45,683
We'll start from scratch, darling.
My job from now on is ..

181
00:11:45,783 --> 00:11:48,458
To make your life so beautiful you'll
never want to think of anyone but me.

182
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:49,497
That's easy.

183
00:11:50,497 --> 00:11:52,230
And no more theater.
- Why not?

184
00:11:53,081 --> 00:11:55,883
You see mother is an awfully good sport
but she is a little bit old-fashioned.

185
00:11:56,319 --> 00:11:59,178
And I think the shock won't be quite so
severe if I don't have to say "Mother ..

186
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,249
"This is Peggy the beautiful chorus
lady and we're going to be married."

187
00:12:03,511 --> 00:12:04,240
Married?

188
00:12:05,148 --> 00:12:05,888
Oh yes.

189
00:12:07,168 --> 00:12:09,200
Well, maybe I made a
bad job of proposing, but ..

190
00:12:09,948 --> 00:12:11,021
That's what I meant.

191
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:13,919
Don't you want to marry me?
- Oh, of course.

192
00:12:14,854 --> 00:12:16,156
That's all I wanted to hear.

193
00:12:16,755 --> 00:12:19,045
But you don't know anything
about me, about my family ..

194
00:12:19,263 --> 00:12:20,378
I know you are you.

195
00:12:20,592 --> 00:12:21,836
That's all I need to know.

196
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:23,014
Monte.

197
00:12:27,787 --> 00:12:28,994
Giddy up, Dobbin.

198
00:12:37,796 --> 00:12:39,212
May I come up for just a moment?

199
00:12:39,787 --> 00:12:40,545
No, dear.

200
00:12:40,981 --> 00:12:42,999
I want to be alone just so
I can think about you.

201
00:12:44,108 --> 00:12:44,895
Goodnight.

202
00:12:45,925 --> 00:12:46,712
Goodnight.

203
00:12:47,493 --> 00:12:50,120
Will you telephone me the very first
moment you wake up tomorrow morning?

204
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,378
But I might awaken you.

205
00:12:51,691 --> 00:12:53,222
Silly. That's what I want you to do.

206
00:13:24,008 --> 00:13:26,258
Why, you startled me.
- I'm sorry.

207
00:13:26,674 --> 00:13:28,061
I wasn't expecting you, Lyndon.

208
00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:30,000
I dropped into the
theater but you'd gone.

209
00:13:30,252 --> 00:13:32,549
I know. I left straight after the play.
- Yes, I know.

210
00:13:33,691 --> 00:13:34,839
With Monte Van Tyle.

211
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:36,791
We went for a drive in the park.

212
00:13:36,896 --> 00:13:39,520
Well it must have done you
good. You look radiant.

213
00:13:42,819 --> 00:13:44,921
Lyndon .. I have something to tell you.

214
00:13:45,217 --> 00:13:48,042
I know what you want to say and I
know how hard it is for you to say it.

215
00:13:48,921 --> 00:13:50,165
You're in love with Monte.

216
00:13:50,592 --> 00:13:51,455
Desperately.

217
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,258
But you don't want to hurt me.
I appreciate that, too.

218
00:13:54,992 --> 00:13:57,502
You're making it so much harder.
- I don't mean to, dear.

219
00:13:58,846 --> 00:14:01,100
So .. everything is over between us?

220
00:14:04,356 --> 00:14:06,597
We've been very happy together.

221
00:14:07,904 --> 00:14:09,266
And very comfortable.

222
00:14:09,742 --> 00:14:12,131
I just want you to be sure. I don't
want you to make any mistake.

223
00:14:12,989 --> 00:14:15,578
It can't be a mistake when two people
love each other as Monte and I do.

224
00:14:15,749 --> 00:14:17,492
In a year, he may tire of you.

225
00:14:18,017 --> 00:14:20,789
He may amuse himself with you
until the right girl comes along.

226
00:14:20,978 --> 00:14:22,367
Then he'll marry her and ..

227
00:14:23,178 --> 00:14:25,500
Over you will go.
- Oh, but you don't understand.

228
00:14:25,846 --> 00:14:27,262
We're getting married next week.

229
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,108
Oh, I see.

230
00:14:30,685 --> 00:14:33,722
Well, I've known the Van Tyle
family for a great many years.

231
00:14:34,172 --> 00:14:35,931
Are you quite sure you
can make a go of it?

232
00:14:36,605 --> 00:14:39,179
I'm no marrying his family.
He isn't marrying my family.

233
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,988
Do you think you can make him happy?

234
00:14:41,415 --> 00:14:42,459
Oh, I'm sure of it.

235
00:14:44,873 --> 00:14:46,895
Well, the very best
of luck to you, Peggy.

236
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:48,550
Thank you.

237
00:14:48,965 --> 00:14:50,195
Needless to say.

238
00:14:50,794 --> 00:14:52,629
I'm going to miss you terribly.

239
00:14:58,701 --> 00:14:59,570
Lyndon.

240
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,141
Lyndon!

241
00:15:04,468 --> 00:15:06,658
I want you to know how
very grateful I am to you.

242
00:15:07,062 --> 00:15:08,707
You've been such a darling
- Thank you.

243
00:15:09,447 --> 00:15:11,958
I love you Peggy, and
I'm afraid I always will.

244
00:15:13,011 --> 00:15:14,553
Goodbye, dear.
- Goodbye.

245
00:15:16,077 --> 00:15:18,760
You know, you almost make me
wish that I were a marrying man.

246
00:15:20,465 --> 00:15:21,463
But I'm not.

247
00:15:31,475 --> 00:15:34,696
By virtue of the power invested in me by
the city of New York, New York State ..

248
00:15:34,796 --> 00:15:37,398
In the presence of these witnesses I
hereby pronounce you man and wife.

249
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:38,606
Two dollars please.

250
00:16:40,985 --> 00:16:42,115
A little bit of Paris.

251
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:49,838
Peggy.

252
00:17:50,187 --> 00:17:53,025
Do you realize I've spoken to you five
times and you haven't answered me?

253
00:17:53,198 --> 00:17:54,347
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.

254
00:17:54,447 --> 00:17:56,322
I want to talk to you.
- Of course.

255
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,588
Wait until I just get my chips.

256
00:17:59,336 --> 00:18:01,533
Will you take them?
- Yes, we'll cash them later.

257
00:18:04,024 --> 00:18:05,726
Let's sit over there.
- Alright, darling.

258
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:14,814
Isn't it thrilling?

259
00:18:14,914 --> 00:18:17,188
I could live here forever.
- That wouldn't please me at all.

260
00:18:17,288 --> 00:18:18,119
Why not?

261
00:18:18,377 --> 00:18:20,018
It's so exciting.
- That's just why.

262
00:18:20,544 --> 00:18:21,536
What do you mean?

263
00:18:21,636 --> 00:18:24,040
When you gamble, you
seem to forget everything.

264
00:18:24,377 --> 00:18:25,280
Even me.

265
00:18:25,466 --> 00:18:26,849
Sweetheart.
- But you do.

266
00:18:27,741 --> 00:18:29,529
It seems to take complete
possession of you.

267
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:31,782
That isn't good for you, darling.

268
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:33,906
Besides, I'm just a little bit jealous.

269
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,993
I don't want to share you with anything.

270
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:37,851
Not even gambling.

271
00:18:38,623 --> 00:18:40,176
You know, my father once said.

272
00:18:40,564 --> 00:18:42,695
That chance was the most
fascinating thing in the world.

273
00:18:42,927 --> 00:18:44,200
It's in the blood, I guess.

274
00:18:44,902 --> 00:18:45,946
But, oh my dearest.

275
00:18:46,196 --> 00:18:47,765
If it upsets you one little bit ..

276
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:49,599
I promise never to do it again.

277
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,088
Honest?
- Honest.

278
00:18:52,642 --> 00:18:56,356
You know, I'm convinced more than ever I
married the sweetest girl in the world.

279
00:19:26,547 --> 00:19:27,757
Welcome home, darling.

280
00:19:28,627 --> 00:19:30,186
This isn't ..
- Yep, it's all yours.

281
00:19:30,498 --> 00:19:32,458
Oh but ..
- They started building the day we left.

282
00:19:33,552 --> 00:19:35,723
Well don't expect me to say anything.
- Don't say a word.

283
00:19:41,939 --> 00:19:44,550
The servants have strict orders
to keep themselves out of sight.

284
00:19:44,731 --> 00:19:46,735
Until I've shown it
to you all by myself.

285
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,177
And if they disobey me.

286
00:19:49,602 --> 00:19:50,747
Off go their heads.

287
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,845
You can carry this.

288
00:19:56,132 --> 00:19:59,477
It's a custom for a bride to be carried
across the threshold of a new home.

289
00:19:59,895 --> 00:20:00,624
Darling.

290
00:20:05,935 --> 00:20:06,802
Here we are.

291
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,376
It's all .. it's all so
unbelievably wonderful.

292
00:20:13,425 --> 00:20:14,577
I hope I don't cry.

293
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:18,434
Was there ever a girl lucky enough
to have a husband like you?

294
00:20:18,626 --> 00:20:19,987
Well I don't know. I doubt it.

295
00:20:20,955 --> 00:20:23,201
I want to show you upstairs first.
- May I take off my hat?

296
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,099
Well I don't know why not.
It's your house.

297
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:26,700
There.
- Come along.

298
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,473
And this is a very special room.

299
00:21:02,812 --> 00:21:04,378
I cabled just as soon as you told me.

300
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:06,340
Do you like it?

301
00:21:06,701 --> 00:21:07,488
Oh, Monte.

302
00:21:08,572 --> 00:21:10,753
It will take all my life to
make you understand.

303
00:21:11,902 --> 00:21:13,122
Just how much I adore it.

304
00:21:16,154 --> 00:21:17,035
Our home.

305
00:21:18,349 --> 00:21:20,334
Why .. I love it so much, I ..

306
00:21:21,092 --> 00:21:22,794
I could just sit down
on the floor and ..

307
00:21:23,725 --> 00:21:24,426
Pat it.

308
00:21:30,776 --> 00:21:32,603
And here is an old friend of ours.

309
00:21:36,064 --> 00:21:38,396
Why, it's the little cherub we
found in Florence.   - Remember?

310
00:21:38,687 --> 00:21:40,189
He looks right at home, doesn't he.

311
00:21:40,701 --> 00:21:41,610
Oh, Monte.

312
00:21:42,508 --> 00:21:43,966
I never want to leave this house.

313
00:21:44,575 --> 00:21:45,946
I want to live here always.

314
00:21:47,715 --> 00:21:48,960
So you shall.

315
00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:08,183
Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

316
00:22:08,784 --> 00:22:10,871
Please tell Mr Van Tyle
his mother is calling.

317
00:22:11,406 --> 00:22:12,662
Yes, Mrs Van Tyle.

318
00:22:17,473 --> 00:22:18,798
Hello, mother.
- Monte.

319
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:21,092
You never told me. Not even a note.

320
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,873
I had to read it in the newspapers.

321
00:22:22,973 --> 00:22:24,555
You've had our address for some time.

322
00:22:24,655 --> 00:22:26,485
Don't argue. Tell me how they are.

323
00:22:26,585 --> 00:22:27,633
You mean the baby?

324
00:22:27,733 --> 00:22:29,604
Silly. Did you think I meant the cook?

325
00:22:30,842 --> 00:22:33,346
Is this a peace offering
or just .. curiosity?

326
00:22:33,525 --> 00:22:37,147
I rather thought the peace offering was
yours as you made the child my namesake.

327
00:22:37,512 --> 00:22:39,633
That was Peggy's idea.
- Oh, bless her.

328
00:22:39,979 --> 00:22:42,040
Monte, she will forgive me, won't she?

329
00:22:44,394 --> 00:22:45,038
Uhuh.

330
00:22:47,927 --> 00:22:49,553
Wait until you see the little devil.

331
00:22:49,653 --> 00:22:50,754
She's got your mouth.

332
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,855
A nose like father's, Peggy's eyes.

333
00:22:53,296 --> 00:22:55,778
And somehow she manages to
look just a little bit like me.

334
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,471
Oh, I can't wait to see her.

335
00:22:58,703 --> 00:22:59,544
Come along.

336
00:23:00,716 --> 00:23:02,499
Oh, she's a beautiful child.

337
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:04,739
What did you expect, mother?
- Conceited.

338
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:06,518
Not at all. Look at her mother.

339
00:23:07,746 --> 00:23:10,082
As a matter of fact, she
doesn't look like either of you.

340
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,030
She's the living image
of her grandmother.

341
00:23:13,411 --> 00:23:14,430
Sweetness.

342
00:23:16,453 --> 00:23:17,444
Yes, darling.

343
00:23:18,093 --> 00:23:18,900
Yes.

344
00:23:19,926 --> 00:23:21,165
Oh little baby.

345
00:23:40,951 --> 00:23:42,555
I always love dancing with Monte.

346
00:23:42,765 --> 00:23:44,762
Thank you, dear.
It's mutual, I assure you.

347
00:23:45,055 --> 00:23:47,877
Congratulations, darling.
Your party is a huge success.

348
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,056
Thank you, mother.

349
00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:50,966
You're a lovely hostess.

350
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,593
I'm very proud of you.

351
00:23:53,988 --> 00:23:56,130
Well Lyndon, this is a surprise.

352
00:23:56,447 --> 00:23:59,352
You have neglected me.
- It's been my loss entirely, Eleanor.

353
00:23:59,857 --> 00:24:02,257
I'm afraid I've neglected
most of my friends lately.

354
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:04,382
What have you been doing?
- Nothing.

355
00:24:04,937 --> 00:24:06,670
Including a trip around the world.

356
00:24:06,938 --> 00:24:09,424
I go from place to place
and do the same thing.

357
00:24:09,827 --> 00:24:11,296
Nothing.
- You're depressed.

358
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,532
No, no. Just disinterested.

359
00:24:15,848 --> 00:24:17,379
Hello mother.
- Hello, my darlings.

360
00:24:17,602 --> 00:24:19,210
Here is my cure for that trouble.

361
00:24:19,547 --> 00:24:20,865
Come and give me a big hug.

362
00:24:22,374 --> 00:24:25,236
Oh dear, may I present an
old friend of mine - Mr Fiske.

363
00:24:25,611 --> 00:24:26,692
My daughter-in-law.

364
00:24:27,556 --> 00:24:28,457
How do you do.

365
00:24:28,911 --> 00:24:29,783
Mrs Van Tyle.

366
00:24:30,071 --> 00:24:31,144
And this is Eleanor.

367
00:24:31,491 --> 00:24:32,793
Why, how do you do, Eleanor.

368
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:33,954
How do you do.

369
00:24:36,512 --> 00:24:37,420
A cookie?

370
00:24:38,013 --> 00:24:39,297
Darling, you mustn't beg.

371
00:24:39,397 --> 00:24:41,630
Particularly not first thing
when you come in the house.

372
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,216
Oh, but after all, a cookies is an
enormously important thing in life.

373
00:24:45,678 --> 00:24:47,018
Shall we go exploring dear?

374
00:24:47,198 --> 00:24:48,385
Can't I ring for Jacobs?

375
00:24:48,542 --> 00:24:50,513
Oh no. It is much more fun to explore.

376
00:24:50,808 --> 00:24:51,625
Come dear.

377
00:24:51,725 --> 00:24:54,714
You take me where you think there is
the best chance of finding a cookie.

378
00:24:55,289 --> 00:24:56,844
You will excuse us?
- Of course.

379
00:24:59,352 --> 00:25:01,209
My heartiest congratulations.

380
00:25:02,425 --> 00:25:03,441
Thank you, Lyndon.

381
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:08,293
And thank you for smoothing
over a very difficult situation.

382
00:25:08,501 --> 00:25:10,472
You need never worry on
that account, my dear.

383
00:25:11,389 --> 00:25:13,970
It's evidently unnecessary to
ask if you've been happy.

384
00:25:14,275 --> 00:25:16,520
Oh, is it so apparent?
- Oh, yes.

385
00:25:17,045 --> 00:25:18,212
Tell me about yourself.

386
00:25:18,427 --> 00:25:20,294
There is nothing much to tell except ..

387
00:25:20,713 --> 00:25:22,013
That I've missed you.

388
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,109
I've missed you more that it is possible
for one human being to miss another.

389
00:25:26,503 --> 00:25:28,119
But surely there has been someone else?

390
00:25:28,219 --> 00:25:30,981
Oh yes. Attempts have been
made to console me, but ..

391
00:25:31,709 --> 00:25:33,039
Well now, how shall I put it?

392
00:25:33,544 --> 00:25:35,743
The remedy was more
painful than the ailment.

393
00:25:36,197 --> 00:25:38,084
You've been abroad a lot, haven't you?
- Yes.

394
00:25:38,184 --> 00:25:39,828
I'm back now to see my favorite surgeon.

395
00:25:40,429 --> 00:25:41,822
He wants to do a little ..

396
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:43,421
Experimenting.

397
00:25:43,706 --> 00:25:45,811
Oh, I'm sorry, Lyndon.
- It's nothing very serious.

398
00:25:46,037 --> 00:25:48,433
You know, hospitals are
such dreary places.

399
00:25:49,175 --> 00:25:52,626
I should appreciate it so, if you'd come
and sit at the bedside some afternoon.

400
00:25:55,356 --> 00:25:56,949
Well I .. I'm afraid that ..

401
00:25:58,053 --> 00:26:00,047
Well, we found the cookie jar.

402
00:26:00,354 --> 00:26:01,713
Did you thank Grandma?
- Yes.

403
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:06,670
"<i>Dear Peggy. Convalescence
is a dreary business</i>."

404
00:26:07,091 --> 00:26:10,726
"<i>The doctor threatens to send me
to Europe and I may never return</i>."

405
00:26:11,484 --> 00:26:14,648
"<i>Won't you drop in some
afternoon - for old time's sake?</i>"

406
00:26:25,409 --> 00:26:27,735
You must follow my
directions implicitly.

407
00:26:27,935 --> 00:26:28,921
And if I don't?

408
00:26:29,535 --> 00:26:31,602
Six months, possibly a year.

409
00:26:31,978 --> 00:26:32,779
Perhaps.

410
00:26:33,108 --> 00:26:35,410
Oh well. I've been everywhere,
seen everything.

411
00:26:35,658 --> 00:26:38,006
I hope old man .. I haven't alarmed you.

412
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,783
No, no, no. Not a bit.

413
00:26:40,424 --> 00:26:41,667
I must be running along.

414
00:26:44,323 --> 00:26:46,795
Incidentally .. no more champagne.

415
00:26:48,688 --> 00:26:50,155
No more champagne, huh?

416
00:26:51,942 --> 00:26:52,566
Yes.

417
00:27:09,922 --> 00:27:10,751
Pardon me.

418
00:27:17,992 --> 00:27:18,979
How is he, James?

419
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:20,753
Very little change, I am afraid.

420
00:27:20,939 --> 00:27:22,531
I came as soon as I got your message.

421
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:23,813
Shall I go right in?

422
00:27:23,965 --> 00:27:25,405
Yes, ma'am. He is expecting you.

423
00:27:31,554 --> 00:27:32,694
Please don't get up.

424
00:27:32,794 --> 00:27:33,890
Oh, but I shall.

425
00:27:36,998 --> 00:27:37,928
Let's sit here.

426
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:40,982
How are you feeling?

427
00:27:41,971 --> 00:27:44,062
Nothing changes except for the worse.

428
00:27:44,576 --> 00:27:46,896
I'm to be exiled. Baden Baden.

429
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:49,250
Hmm. A stupid existence.

430
00:27:49,595 --> 00:27:50,811
But it won't be for long.

431
00:27:51,256 --> 00:27:52,731
You are probably right my dear.

432
00:27:53,512 --> 00:27:54,695
It won't be for long.

433
00:28:01,144 --> 00:28:03,375
I'm glad you finally decided
to come and see me.

434
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:05,552
For the last time.

435
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:08,288
So you're passing sentence on me too?

436
00:28:08,638 --> 00:28:09,489
If I must.

437
00:28:10,553 --> 00:28:12,834
I made one great mistake in my life.

438
00:28:13,897 --> 00:28:15,064
Ever giving you up.

439
00:28:15,526 --> 00:28:16,945
You couldn't very well help it.

440
00:28:17,045 --> 00:28:18,547
I could have asked you to marry me.

441
00:28:18,848 --> 00:28:20,237
That was my great mistake.

442
00:28:20,856 --> 00:28:23,030
If I hadn't been so sure of myself.

443
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:24,622
I wouldn't be alone now.

444
00:28:25,474 --> 00:28:27,328
And Peggy, I need you.
- Please ..

445
00:28:27,501 --> 00:28:29,495
I should never have
let you go my darling.

446
00:28:29,761 --> 00:28:30,433
Never.

447
00:28:30,978 --> 00:28:32,989
You are the one person
on earth I have loved.

448
00:28:33,706 --> 00:28:35,807
Loved passionately, devotedly.

449
00:28:36,269 --> 00:28:37,777
And I always will love you.

450
00:28:38,301 --> 00:28:39,121
Always.

451
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:41,371
Right through to the end.

452
00:28:41,796 --> 00:28:43,540
You are being unfair.
- No, wait.

453
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,787
I should have known we
couldn't go on being friends.

454
00:28:45,955 --> 00:28:47,085
Peggy, I am desperate.

455
00:28:47,628 --> 00:28:49,873
It's cowardly perhaps,
but I can't face it alone.

456
00:28:50,662 --> 00:28:52,232
I can't live without you.

457
00:28:52,764 --> 00:28:53,944
I can't and I won't.

458
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,126
I'm sorry, Lyndon.

459
00:28:56,772 --> 00:28:57,816
But I am going now.

460
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:00,057
And I'm never coming back again.

461
00:29:04,306 --> 00:29:05,078
Alright.

462
00:29:06,675 --> 00:29:08,855
I told you I'd love you
right through to the end.

463
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:15,384
Lyndon, you mustn't!
Lyndon! You mustn't.

464
00:29:15,582 --> 00:29:18,057
You mustn't, I tell you. You mustn't
kill yourself. I won't let you!

465
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:18,986
Stop it!

466
00:29:19,777 --> 00:29:20,851
[ Gunshot! ]

467
00:29:55,066 --> 00:29:57,334
You killed Lyndon Fiske.
- That's not true!

468
00:29:57,687 --> 00:29:59,675
I had no reason to wish him
anything but happiness.

469
00:29:59,838 --> 00:30:01,614
I didn't do it, I tell you.
I didn't do it!

470
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:10,102
Manslaughter.

471
00:30:13,114 --> 00:30:14,003
Twenty years.

472
00:30:14,391 --> 00:30:15,790
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.

473
00:30:16,369 --> 00:30:18,842
But after all, she did
go there to see him.

474
00:30:19,316 --> 00:30:20,753
How often, you don't know.

475
00:30:21,307 --> 00:30:23,501
She was unfaithful.
- That's not true.

476
00:30:24,801 --> 00:30:26,522
Whatever you or anyone else may think.

477
00:30:27,875 --> 00:30:29,288
I still believe in my wife.

478
00:30:42,931 --> 00:30:44,228
I came as soon as I could.

479
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,376
I want to thank you, Monte.

480
00:30:46,865 --> 00:30:48,138
For all you've done for me.

481
00:30:49,287 --> 00:30:51,218
You see, they are taking
me to Auburn tomorrow.

482
00:30:57,159 --> 00:30:58,156
Let's sit down.

483
00:31:01,916 --> 00:31:03,304
It can't change things.

484
00:31:04,054 --> 00:31:05,585
But it would help me to know that ..

485
00:31:05,763 --> 00:31:07,122
You believed I told the truth.

486
00:31:08,755 --> 00:31:09,645
I do.

487
00:31:10,648 --> 00:31:12,611
I never believed anything
else for an instant.

488
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:14,983
I'm glad of that.

489
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,985
I wish it were possible for you
never to think of me again.

490
00:31:20,529 --> 00:31:22,489
That's the way I'd like you
to go ahead with life.

491
00:31:23,845 --> 00:31:24,574
You see.

492
00:31:25,324 --> 00:31:26,797
You have the baby to take care of.

493
00:31:28,422 --> 00:31:29,916
She's so very little.

494
00:31:31,705 --> 00:31:33,588
She won't even remember
me after a while.

495
00:31:40,259 --> 00:31:41,750
Don't tell her unless you have to.

496
00:31:43,286 --> 00:31:46,005
Or someday some stupid
fool will probably tell her.

497
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,927
Then the truth would be better.

498
00:31:51,162 --> 00:31:52,909
You can be the best
judge of that, Monte.

499
00:31:54,874 --> 00:31:56,223
Just try to protect her.

500
00:31:59,889 --> 00:32:00,590
I will.

501
00:32:02,637 --> 00:32:04,193
And I'll always stand by.

502
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,494
Ready. Waiting to help you.

503
00:32:09,453 --> 00:32:10,420
I'm going now.

504
00:32:21,988 --> 00:32:22,645
No.

505
00:32:23,798 --> 00:32:24,875
Don't say goodbye.

506
00:33:32,945 --> 00:33:33,934
Goodnight, Peggy.

507
00:33:34,034 --> 00:33:35,828
See you tomorrow.
- Pleasant dreams.

508
00:33:36,609 --> 00:33:37,396
Goodnight.

509
00:33:55,626 --> 00:33:56,613
Killed in action.

510
00:33:59,783 --> 00:34:00,778
Poor Monte.

511
00:35:29,964 --> 00:35:33,497
Besides the fact that you declined to
take financial help from Mr Van Tyle.

512
00:35:34,042 --> 00:35:36,129
His mother left the sum
of five thousand dollars.

513
00:35:36,366 --> 00:35:38,097
To be given you in the
event of her death.

514
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:40,048
That was very kind of her.

515
00:35:40,569 --> 00:35:41,527
I shall need it.

516
00:35:41,811 --> 00:35:43,698
Mrs Van Tyle understood, I believe ..

517
00:35:44,375 --> 00:35:46,915
That you would make no attempt to
communicate with your daughter.

518
00:35:47,785 --> 00:35:49,688
Eleanor has been taught
to think of you as dead.

519
00:35:54,643 --> 00:35:55,515
I understand.

520
00:35:56,386 --> 00:35:57,173
I'm sorry.

521
00:35:58,462 --> 00:36:00,282
You intend to leave New York, I suppose?

522
00:36:00,921 --> 00:36:02,743
I promise you shall never
hear from me again.

523
00:36:05,126 --> 00:36:06,628
Would you mind cashing that for me?

524
00:36:07,004 --> 00:36:07,791
Of course.

525
00:36:08,439 --> 00:36:10,339
If you will just endorse it, please.

526
00:36:12,767 --> 00:36:15,998
You see, the reporters at the hotel make
it impossible for me to return there.

527
00:36:16,568 --> 00:36:18,156
I shall have to buy some other things.

528
00:36:18,929 --> 00:36:19,830
There you are.

529
00:36:22,744 --> 00:36:23,767
I want everything.

530
00:36:24,031 --> 00:36:25,697
A manicure, a massage.

531
00:36:26,459 --> 00:36:27,824
The color of my hair changed.

532
00:36:28,098 --> 00:36:30,182
Henna is the very latest shade, Madame.

533
00:36:30,794 --> 00:36:31,466
Henna?

534
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,089
Alright.

535
00:36:35,014 --> 00:36:37,471
I want to go out of here a
completely different person.

536
00:36:38,411 --> 00:36:39,492
Very good, Madame.

537
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:40,845
Emily.

538
00:36:41,309 --> 00:36:42,210
You may start.

539
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:07,784
Madame.

540
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:10,140
There is the new woman.

541
00:37:42,285 --> 00:37:43,215
Good afternoon.

542
00:37:45,974 --> 00:37:46,904
Good afternoon.

543
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,911
Delightful weather, don't you think?

544
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:54,759
The old ocean is as still as a millpond.

545
00:37:56,977 --> 00:37:58,307
Looks like a record crossing.

546
00:37:58,733 --> 00:37:59,863
How blue the water is.

547
00:38:01,633 --> 00:38:02,877
Have we left out anything?

548
00:38:03,896 --> 00:38:04,826
I'm afraid not.

549
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:07,310
Yes, you forgot to ask me to
take a stroll around the deck.

550
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,265
I was coming to that .. how about it?

551
00:38:09,866 --> 00:38:11,446
No thanks .. later, perhaps.

552
00:38:13,102 --> 00:38:15,233
Would you like to have a
cocktail with me before dinner?

553
00:38:15,445 --> 00:38:16,779
Yes, I'd like to.

554
00:38:17,071 --> 00:38:17,800
Alright.

555
00:38:18,203 --> 00:38:19,705
I'll see you at the bar. What time?

556
00:38:19,805 --> 00:38:21,076
Six-thirty.
- Fine.

557
00:38:29,545 --> 00:38:30,885
Pardon me, Mrs Stone.
- Yes?

558
00:38:30,985 --> 00:38:32,724
It is our unpleasant
duty now and then ..

559
00:38:32,824 --> 00:38:35,060
To warn passengers against
certain other passengers.

560
00:38:35,292 --> 00:38:35,993
Really?

561
00:38:36,153 --> 00:38:37,565
That Mr Blaine.

562
00:38:38,127 --> 00:38:39,686
Happens to be a professional gambler.

563
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:41,037
Oh.

564
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:42,828
How interesting.

565
00:38:43,064 --> 00:38:45,224
A very amusing and a charming
sort of person, to be sure.

566
00:38:45,808 --> 00:38:47,653
But not one with whom to play cards.

567
00:38:48,515 --> 00:38:49,896
I trust you will forgive me.

568
00:38:50,935 --> 00:38:52,380
Thank you so much for telling me.

569
00:38:52,666 --> 00:38:54,724
If you find me playing
with him, don't be upset.

570
00:38:55,331 --> 00:38:57,308
I can afford to lose
whatever I shall lose.

571
00:38:57,614 --> 00:38:58,801
Just for the experience.

572
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:03,425
A packet of cigarettes, please.
- Yes, sir.

573
00:40:10,499 --> 00:40:11,429
Thank you, sir.

574
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,010
I'm out, thanks.
- No more for me.

575
00:40:22,675 --> 00:40:23,862
It's my deal, Mr Blaine.

576
00:40:24,045 --> 00:40:24,999
Oh, I'm sorry.

577
00:40:29,175 --> 00:40:30,127
Just you and I?

578
00:40:30,562 --> 00:40:31,496
I'm afraid so.

579
00:40:32,005 --> 00:40:34,573
Do you mind if I change the cards?
- No, no. Not at all.

580
00:40:34,673 --> 00:40:35,807
Steward.
- Yes, sir?

581
00:40:35,907 --> 00:40:37,439
Two new decks please.
- Yes, sir.

582
00:40:41,896 --> 00:40:43,533
Eyes hurting?
- Terribly.

583
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,185
The smoke is bothering me.

584
00:40:46,693 --> 00:40:49,057
You know Mrs Stone, it is very
seldom that one finds a woman ..

585
00:40:49,157 --> 00:40:50,859
With the sense of
gambling that you have.

586
00:40:52,836 --> 00:40:53,959
Have you played long?

587
00:40:54,566 --> 00:40:55,709
Since I was a child.

588
00:40:57,345 --> 00:40:59,307
I used to play with my father
and my grandfather.

589
00:40:59,854 --> 00:41:00,898
I can believe that.

590
00:41:01,581 --> 00:41:02,769
You play a man's game.

591
00:41:03,497 --> 00:41:05,886
That's one of the nicest compliments
you could pay me, Mr Blaine.

592
00:41:06,383 --> 00:41:07,232
Not at all.

593
00:41:07,707 --> 00:41:10,400
The difference between our stacks shows
that it is more than mere flattery.

594
00:41:12,427 --> 00:41:14,158
Let's hope the new
cards change your luck.

595
00:41:14,813 --> 00:41:15,621
Thank you.

596
00:41:26,506 --> 00:41:27,722
Shall we raise the limit?

597
00:41:28,225 --> 00:41:29,241
You are the loser.

598
00:41:29,925 --> 00:41:31,398
Let's try a round of table stakes.

599
00:41:32,813 --> 00:41:33,644
Alright.

600
00:41:55,036 --> 00:41:56,109
Jack bets a hundred.

601
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,818
Another hundred.

602
00:42:06,849 --> 00:42:08,078
You'd better watch out.

603
00:42:08,178 --> 00:42:09,365
I think you're bluffing.

604
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:14,257
I check.

605
00:42:15,664 --> 00:42:16,451
Let's see.

606
00:42:17,664 --> 00:42:19,162
You have a possible straight.

607
00:42:23,976 --> 00:42:24,871
Five hundred.

608
00:42:25,252 --> 00:42:26,124
Five hundred?

609
00:42:27,034 --> 00:42:28,974
On what, may I ask?
- On a hunch.

610
00:42:31,196 --> 00:42:32,783
In that case I'll raise you five.

611
00:42:34,348 --> 00:42:35,478
That makes a thousand.

612
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,857
Ready?
- Ready.

613
00:42:43,155 --> 00:42:44,527
Can you beat a pair of jacks?

614
00:42:44,627 --> 00:42:45,842
It's your bet, Mr Blaine.

615
00:42:46,406 --> 00:42:47,908
Don't tell me you're going to stay?

616
00:42:48,161 --> 00:42:48,976
Frightened?

617
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,327
I bet a thousand.

618
00:42:57,173 --> 00:42:59,335
A thousand .. and a thousand more.

619
00:43:00,545 --> 00:43:01,618
Thinking of calling?

620
00:43:04,988 --> 00:43:06,543
Why should I when I have you beaten?

621
00:43:09,509 --> 00:43:11,024
You would accept my IOU I hope?

622
00:43:11,517 --> 00:43:12,465
Certainly.

623
00:43:17,936 --> 00:43:18,679
Alright.

624
00:43:19,223 --> 00:43:20,187
I'll call.

625
00:43:21,692 --> 00:43:22,537
Three jacks.

626
00:43:28,969 --> 00:43:29,727
Straight.

627
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,736
Have a cigarette?
- No thanks.

628
00:43:47,081 --> 00:43:47,999
Not just now.

629
00:43:49,297 --> 00:43:50,599
A beautiful night, isn't it.

630
00:43:50,892 --> 00:43:51,617
Very.

631
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,919
You'd better keep this.

632
00:43:55,348 --> 00:43:57,296
The ace of spades has
never brought me any luck.

633
00:43:57,704 --> 00:43:59,965
Besides, I wouldn't want to
spoil that nice deck for you.

634
00:44:01,152 --> 00:44:01,932
Thanks.

635
00:44:02,581 --> 00:44:04,939
It does take quite a bit of time
to work up a deck like this.

636
00:44:05,996 --> 00:44:07,363
As for this IOU.

637
00:44:09,503 --> 00:44:10,805
Perhaps we'd better file it.

638
00:44:13,703 --> 00:44:15,176
With my present state of finances.

639
00:44:15,651 --> 00:44:18,269
I'm sure it's much more valuable
to the fish than it could be to you.

640
00:44:19,601 --> 00:44:20,273
Broke?

641
00:44:21,133 --> 00:44:22,654
Yes, but don't let that worry you.

642
00:44:24,845 --> 00:44:26,261
Will a thousand see you through?

643
00:44:30,861 --> 00:44:31,568
Thanks.

644
00:44:32,484 --> 00:44:33,528
You'll get it back.

645
00:44:33,961 --> 00:44:35,867
Let's flip a coin. Double or nothing.

646
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:37,770
Alright.

647
00:44:39,219 --> 00:44:39,908
Heads.

648
00:44:40,543 --> 00:44:41,387
Tails it is.

649
00:44:41,723 --> 00:44:42,538
We're even.

650
00:44:43,582 --> 00:44:44,826
Now I'll have a cigarette.

651
00:44:47,562 --> 00:44:49,615
I would like to know where
you learned to play cards.

652
00:44:50,749 --> 00:44:52,897
Let's proceed on the basis
of "no questions asked".

653
00:44:53,832 --> 00:44:54,949
Just as you say.

654
00:44:59,261 --> 00:45:00,076
I like you.

655
00:45:01,348 --> 00:45:02,049
Thanks.

656
00:45:02,851 --> 00:45:06,359
Do you think we'd do better if we teamed
instead of working against each other?

657
00:45:08,309 --> 00:45:09,128
Why not?

658
00:45:10,472 --> 00:45:12,498
Then you want to proceed
on a business basis only?

659
00:45:12,681 --> 00:45:13,553
That's right.

660
00:45:14,424 --> 00:45:15,840
You are a very attractive woman.

661
00:45:16,234 --> 00:45:17,307
And I am only human.

662
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:19,074
I can keep my head.

663
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:21,198
Can you keep it for both of us?
- Hmm.

664
00:45:22,381 --> 00:45:23,110
Alright.

665
00:45:23,381 --> 00:45:25,062
We'll try it out and see how it works.

666
00:45:26,941 --> 00:45:27,895
I'll chance it.

667
00:45:28,537 --> 00:45:30,325
It's a gamble, like
everything else in life.

668
00:45:32,132 --> 00:45:32,946
I'm out.

669
00:45:34,133 --> 00:45:34,862
I check.

670
00:45:37,043 --> 00:45:37,889
Two hundred.

671
00:45:50,304 --> 00:45:51,348
I'll raise you two.

672
00:45:54,532 --> 00:45:55,404
I'll see you.

673
00:46:02,299 --> 00:46:03,890
You are certainly lucky, Mr Blaine.

674
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:06,507
He certainly is. I've never
seen anything like it.

675
00:46:07,272 --> 00:46:08,173
It is my deal.

676
00:46:18,732 --> 00:46:20,369
Bonsoir, Madame.
- Bonsoir, Monsieur.

677
00:46:20,573 --> 00:46:23,305
[ French language ]

678
00:46:28,122 --> 00:46:29,641
Well this looks like a celebration.

679
00:46:29,994 --> 00:46:31,340
It is.
- What for?

680
00:46:31,799 --> 00:46:33,043
Don't you remember?
- No.

681
00:46:34,614 --> 00:46:35,916
In honor of our partnership.

682
00:46:36,193 --> 00:46:37,553
That is two years old tonight.

683
00:46:37,882 --> 00:46:39,470
Ah, that was sweet of you to remember.

684
00:46:39,592 --> 00:46:40,469
Not at all.

685
00:46:40,694 --> 00:46:42,393
It was a great night for me finding you.

686
00:46:42,707 --> 00:46:44,000
That goes two ways.

687
00:46:44,295 --> 00:46:45,067
Thanks.

688
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:48,634
Well, now the mutual admiration
society can sit down and have supper.

689
00:46:49,232 --> 00:46:50,026
Peggy.

690
00:46:51,066 --> 00:46:52,082
I love you, dear.

691
00:46:53,236 --> 00:46:54,252
You mustn't, Bill.

692
00:46:54,565 --> 00:46:55,319
Why not?

693
00:46:55,957 --> 00:46:58,151
I seem to hurt anybody
whoever cares for me.

694
00:46:58,496 --> 00:46:59,869
I'm not worried about that.

695
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:02,386
But I don't want to be hurt either.

696
00:47:02,521 --> 00:47:03,880
You gamble on everything else.

697
00:47:04,467 --> 00:47:05,339
Why not love?

698
00:47:07,706 --> 00:47:09,008
I'm going to keep on trying.

699
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:10,668
Come on.

700
00:48:19,246 --> 00:48:20,134
Hello, Bill.

701
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:21,990
Hello, Peggy.

702
00:48:23,378 --> 00:48:24,708
Can you spare some good news?

703
00:48:25,069 --> 00:48:26,803
When do we sail?
- This news is different.

704
00:48:27,569 --> 00:48:29,414
I know how you feel
about staying in New York.

705
00:48:29,611 --> 00:48:30,770
And this means staying.

706
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,309
Now don't say you won't do
it until I tell you what it is.

707
00:48:35,188 --> 00:48:37,336
Come on, get your hat and
coat on. We're going places.

708
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:39,809
Alright.

709
00:48:43,892 --> 00:48:45,902
This chap Bonelli has taken
over the entire house.

710
00:48:46,609 --> 00:48:48,254
He owns it and he knows the best people.

711
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:50,301
It's going to be the class
Speakeasy of New York.

712
00:48:50,518 --> 00:48:51,702
It's a perfect layout.

713
00:48:52,297 --> 00:48:53,885
What are you going to be, a bartender?

714
00:48:54,456 --> 00:48:56,253
I've always wanted
to be a hat-check girl.

715
00:48:56,546 --> 00:48:57,790
Now don't be silly, Peggy.

716
00:48:58,145 --> 00:48:58,789
Look.

717
00:48:59,002 --> 00:49:00,790
He's arranged for
gambling on the top floor.

718
00:49:01,073 --> 00:49:02,203
I have the concession.

719
00:49:02,592 --> 00:49:03,751
I thought we were "we"?

720
00:49:04,074 --> 00:49:05,175
Here is the big idea.

721
00:49:05,343 --> 00:49:08,031
There has never been a woman
blackjack dealer in New York before.

722
00:49:08,595 --> 00:49:09,839
That's what Bonelli wants.

723
00:49:10,108 --> 00:49:12,091
You as the dealer.
It will be a sensation.

724
00:49:12,716 --> 00:49:15,191
How about all those people on the
boats whose bankrolls we've taken?

725
00:49:16,366 --> 00:49:17,794
You've run that risk before.

726
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:20,573
I don't like this staying in New York.

727
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:22,275
Well Peggy, listen.

728
00:49:34,312 --> 00:49:34,898
Oh.

729
00:49:35,877 --> 00:49:37,230
This is 56th Street.

730
00:49:38,711 --> 00:49:40,077
Don't you feel well?

731
00:49:40,613 --> 00:49:41,512
I'm alright.

732
00:49:42,461 --> 00:49:43,562
Come on, let's go in.

733
00:49:44,158 --> 00:49:46,186
Be nice to Bonelli, Peggy.
He can do a lot for us.

734
00:49:51,893 --> 00:49:53,447
What's the name, please?
- Blaine.

735
00:49:53,777 --> 00:49:54,506
Oh yes.

736
00:50:06,091 --> 00:50:07,871
Well, this is a pleasure.

737
00:50:08,174 --> 00:50:09,422
Mrs Stone - Mr Bonelli.

738
00:50:09,758 --> 00:50:11,539
I've heard about you for a long time.

739
00:50:12,146 --> 00:50:13,047
How do you do.

740
00:50:13,873 --> 00:50:15,117
What do you think of this?

741
00:50:16,707 --> 00:50:17,728
It's amazing.

742
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:19,595
The dining room is over there.

743
00:50:19,961 --> 00:50:21,014
The bar is in here.

744
00:50:21,366 --> 00:50:23,597
What you'll be interested in,
is the top floor.

745
00:50:23,862 --> 00:50:24,506
What?

746
00:50:26,137 --> 00:50:26,752
Yes.

747
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:29,180
By all means, let's see the top floor.

748
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,408
You got a great spot here, Bonelli.

749
00:50:33,508 --> 00:50:35,474
Yes, and I think we're
going to do great business.

750
00:50:39,751 --> 00:50:41,738
Now this is the blackjack room.

751
00:50:43,037 --> 00:50:44,472
Your room, Mrs Stone.

752
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:46,984
Go right in.

753
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,570
Make yourself at home.

754
00:50:56,441 --> 00:50:57,916
And the room just back of this.

755
00:50:58,016 --> 00:50:59,858
Is where we have the
wheel and the tables.

756
00:51:04,053 --> 00:51:05,983
What do you think of
the layout, Mrs Stone?

757
00:51:08,546 --> 00:51:09,453
Mrs Stone.

758
00:51:11,575 --> 00:51:12,622
What did you say?

759
00:51:12,875 --> 00:51:14,491
A pretty swell layout, don't you think?

760
00:51:15,542 --> 00:51:17,187
Yes, I think you've done it beautifully.

761
00:51:18,247 --> 00:51:19,830
So you're all set come with us, eh?

762
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,852
No, I'm afraid that ..
- Now come on, now.

763
00:51:23,824 --> 00:51:25,960
Bill here has told me how
you like to keep travelling.

764
00:51:26,455 --> 00:51:28,956
But this is a set-up that
you can't afford to miss.

765
00:51:29,582 --> 00:51:30,855
I'll tell you what I'll do.

766
00:51:30,955 --> 00:51:32,085
I'll go in the office.

767
00:51:32,269 --> 00:51:34,000
And you talk it over
with the little lady.

768
00:51:34,450 --> 00:51:36,245
I'll see you later.
- Alright, Bonelli.

769
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:45,249
Peggy dear. We can't afford
to pass up this proposition.

770
00:51:45,748 --> 00:51:47,336
You don't seem to realize we're broke.

771
00:51:47,732 --> 00:51:49,005
We've been that way before.

772
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:50,691
I know, but things are different now.

773
00:51:50,791 --> 00:51:52,332
Nobody travels on boats anymore.

774
00:51:52,633 --> 00:51:54,798
And besides, we don't
have to stay here always.

775
00:51:58,221 --> 00:51:59,800
When do we start?
- That's the girl.

776
00:52:00,068 --> 00:52:01,444
Bonelli opens tomorrow night.

777
00:52:01,544 --> 00:52:03,583
Lets go inside and tell him it's okay.
- Alright.

778
00:52:06,742 --> 00:52:07,414
Again.

779
00:52:08,694 --> 00:52:09,595
That's enough.

780
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:13,715
Nineteen. Pay twenty.

781
00:52:14,434 --> 00:52:15,393
Take it away.

782
00:52:16,278 --> 00:52:17,934
You are too lucky.
- Not always.

783
00:52:18,446 --> 00:52:19,230
Leaving?

784
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:20,727
Oh I'll be back after a bit.

785
00:52:21,578 --> 00:52:22,869
Make your bets, please.

786
00:52:35,205 --> 00:52:38,877
Well Eleanor, fancy seeing you here when
there is gambling going on upstairs.

787
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:41,420
I'm not even going near the place.
I like my happy home too much.

788
00:52:41,829 --> 00:52:44,677
You know the only serious row Henry and
I had on our honeymoon was over gambling.

789
00:52:44,777 --> 00:52:46,270
Lose too much?
- Partly that.

790
00:52:46,625 --> 00:52:49,137
He says I go sort-of crazy when I
gamble. I never know when to stop.

791
00:52:50,033 --> 00:52:51,636
I promised him I'd never gamble again.

792
00:52:51,736 --> 00:52:52,866
Is Henry here tonight?

793
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:54,966
No. The poor dear couldn't
come. He had to work.

794
00:52:55,066 --> 00:52:56,500
I came with Freddie and Alice.

795
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,860
I saw Freddie upstairs.
He's losing his shirt at blackjack.

796
00:52:59,147 --> 00:53:01,248
Is the game straight?
- Oh, as far as I know.

797
00:53:01,542 --> 00:53:02,815
A whiskey and soda, please.

798
00:53:03,476 --> 00:53:05,407
Come on up with us in a
while and watch the game.

799
00:53:05,678 --> 00:53:08,619
I'm going to stay down here where I am
safe and the gambling bug can't bite me.

800
00:53:10,561 --> 00:53:12,794
How much you win, Freddie?
- I'd rather not talk about it.

801
00:53:12,894 --> 00:53:14,153
As bad as that?
- Worse.

802
00:53:14,253 --> 00:53:17,150
How would your luck run tonight?
- I'm not even thinking of such things.

803
00:53:17,323 --> 00:53:19,352
Come on, be a sport.
Play these chips for me.

804
00:53:19,452 --> 00:53:21,733
Get thee behind me, Satan.
- But why not?

805
00:53:22,031 --> 00:53:24,561
Say do you want me to be driven out
into the cold by a stern husband?

806
00:53:25,267 --> 00:53:26,027
No, sir.

807
00:53:26,367 --> 00:53:29,363
Henry and I sail for Europe tomorrow
night. I'll not let anything spoil that.

808
00:53:29,561 --> 00:53:31,473
But you wouldn't be gambling really.
- Oh no?

809
00:53:31,573 --> 00:53:33,839
No, you'd be sort of .. well, my broker.

810
00:53:34,302 --> 00:53:36,171
I give you the money. You gamble for me.

811
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:38,633
If you win I'll pay you a commission.
- And if I lose?

812
00:53:38,733 --> 00:53:40,841
I'll pay you a commission anyway.
That will make it legal.

813
00:53:40,941 --> 00:53:42,824
Oh I don't know.
- Oh, it's that woman dealer?

814
00:53:43,166 --> 00:53:45,419
She has a jinx on me.
- I've heard of her, Good, isn't she?

815
00:53:45,519 --> 00:53:47,325
Marvellous, but I'm
sure you can beat her.

816
00:53:47,425 --> 00:53:48,411
Don't be so sure.

817
00:53:48,807 --> 00:53:50,795
But you make me feel I'd like to try.
- Good. Here.

818
00:53:51,429 --> 00:53:54,605
I think I'll take chance my own money.
- Alright, but play my chips. Come on.

819
00:53:58,028 --> 00:53:59,129
Nineteen, pay twenty.

820
00:53:59,923 --> 00:54:00,921
That cleans me.

821
00:54:03,946 --> 00:54:05,105
There you are, Eleanor.

822
00:54:05,405 --> 00:54:07,577
Well, I've brought an expert
to play for me, Mrs Stone.

823
00:54:07,677 --> 00:54:09,280
And I warn you, you're both good.

824
00:54:09,921 --> 00:54:11,824
Don't do any boasting
until I see what I can do.

825
00:54:12,275 --> 00:54:13,599
What are these?
- Fives.

826
00:54:13,885 --> 00:54:15,153
Alright. Let's start easy.

827
00:54:15,506 --> 00:54:16,436
Twenty dollars.

828
00:54:34,918 --> 00:54:36,243
Seventeen, pay eighteen.

829
00:54:38,248 --> 00:54:40,655
Well, let's call it a night, Eleanor.
- No, I want to go on.

830
00:54:41,176 --> 00:54:43,707
The table is closed for tonight.
- Why is it closed? Why should it be?

831
00:54:43,807 --> 00:54:45,176
You're a thousand to the good.

832
00:54:45,276 --> 00:54:47,599
That's fine. Now it's running
my way. Why should I quit?

833
00:54:47,895 --> 00:54:50,071
I want to play and Miss Stone
said the table is closed.

834
00:54:50,288 --> 00:54:52,205
Why is the table closed?
- I'm not feeling well.

835
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:54,142
I'm winning and she wants to quit.

836
00:54:54,242 --> 00:54:55,630
I'll take it over.
- No, Bill.

837
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:57,250
I want to play and I
want to play with you.

838
00:54:57,350 --> 00:54:59,109
Why of course Miss Stone
will deal for you.

839
00:54:59,270 --> 00:55:01,016
She will be only too
glad to deal for you.

840
00:55:01,116 --> 00:55:01,988
Go on, Peggy.

841
00:55:06,405 --> 00:55:08,771
Would you excuse me just a
moment, please. I'll be right back.

842
00:55:13,454 --> 00:55:14,958
Bill.
- Are you crazy?

843
00:55:15,362 --> 00:55:17,241
That girl has you stuck
for a thousand dollars.

844
00:55:17,341 --> 00:55:19,272
Now go in there and get it back.
- I can't do it.

845
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:20,557
You can't do it?

846
00:55:21,626 --> 00:55:24,501
Peggy, I don't know what this is about but
you must go in and win that money back.

847
00:55:25,339 --> 00:55:26,927
She's had her fun, let her pay for it.

848
00:55:28,315 --> 00:55:29,044
Alright.

849
00:55:30,417 --> 00:55:33,192
I'll teach her a lesson that will stop
her gambling for the rest of her life.

850
00:55:36,668 --> 00:55:37,369
Hit me.

851
00:55:38,606 --> 00:55:39,478
Hit me again.

852
00:55:43,017 --> 00:55:43,832
Had enough?

853
00:55:44,434 --> 00:55:46,702
You've got to quit, Eleanor.
You're 5,000 in the hole.

854
00:55:46,914 --> 00:55:48,759
I know I am. I'm going
to win it back. I must.

855
00:55:49,287 --> 00:55:50,130
Go on, deal.

856
00:56:09,767 --> 00:56:10,639
You are over.

857
00:56:18,652 --> 00:56:20,225
Don't you think you'd better stop?

858
00:56:20,325 --> 00:56:21,541
I never stop until I win.

859
00:56:21,966 --> 00:56:22,620
Deal.

860
00:56:31,838 --> 00:56:32,565
Hit me.

861
00:56:45,047 --> 00:56:46,993
Give me one more thousand
at least, please.

862
00:56:47,309 --> 00:56:49,733
Mrs Burgess, $15,000 is a lot of credit.

863
00:56:50,201 --> 00:56:51,830
I'm afraid I can't extend you anymore.

864
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:54,063
But you have to give me a
chance to win some of it back.

865
00:56:54,598 --> 00:56:56,214
Don't you think you've had your chance?

866
00:56:56,314 --> 00:56:58,302
Haven't you learned anything
at this table tonight?

867
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:02,192
Eleanor, please.

868
00:57:06,092 --> 00:57:07,920
Oh he'll divorce me, Freddie.
- Nonsense.

869
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:09,239
He swore he would.

870
00:57:09,339 --> 00:57:10,595
Who is going to tell him?

871
00:57:11,347 --> 00:57:13,201
Where else can I get $15,000?

872
00:57:13,952 --> 00:57:16,205
Why not come back this afternoon
after you've had some rest?

873
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:18,036
We can talk things over.
- Oh could we?

874
00:57:18,187 --> 00:57:18,974
Certainly.

875
00:57:19,245 --> 00:57:21,627
About three o'clock in my office.
- That's the best idea.

876
00:57:21,965 --> 00:57:23,335
Come on, Eleanor. Please.

877
00:57:29,103 --> 00:57:30,490
Maybe she's learned her lesson.

878
00:57:31,371 --> 00:57:32,200
I hope so.

879
00:57:34,734 --> 00:57:35,378
Bill.

880
00:57:35,963 --> 00:57:37,383
Let's see those IOUs.

881
00:57:39,598 --> 00:57:40,642
Let's tear them up.

882
00:57:41,026 --> 00:57:42,515
Tear them up? What for?

883
00:57:43,113 --> 00:57:45,670
Her husband has plenty of money.
- I say we tear them up.

884
00:57:46,679 --> 00:57:49,810
What do you mean? We don't own
this place. We're only working here.

885
00:57:50,451 --> 00:57:53,363
And besides, it isn't just us she owes
the money to. There is Bonelli.

886
00:57:53,871 --> 00:57:55,377
You could talk it over with him.

887
00:57:55,744 --> 00:57:59,402
Do you think I'd be sap enough to ask
Bonelli to tear up IOUs for 15 grand?

888
00:58:00,625 --> 00:58:03,064
But she is so young, and inexperienced.

889
00:58:03,481 --> 00:58:05,397
What do you care?
What does she mean to you?

890
00:58:06,337 --> 00:58:09,187
I don't see anyone running after you
with thousand-dollar bills to give you.

891
00:58:09,755 --> 00:58:11,654
I don't want her to have
to go to her husband.

892
00:58:11,754 --> 00:58:13,588
I can't see why not.
- Bill.

893
00:58:14,626 --> 00:58:16,042
Won't you do it if I ask you do?

894
00:58:17,153 --> 00:58:18,382
At least give her time.

895
00:58:19,115 --> 00:58:20,846
Or this might ruin
that girl's whole life.

896
00:58:27,809 --> 00:58:28,739
Alright, Peggy.

897
00:58:29,565 --> 00:58:30,924
Let's forget about it tonight.

898
00:58:31,631 --> 00:58:33,619
I'll slip in there later and
talk to them about it.

899
00:58:33,999 --> 00:58:34,700
Thanks.

900
00:58:36,222 --> 00:58:37,724
What luck?
- Nothing doing, Peggy.

901
00:58:38,004 --> 00:58:39,077
I've got to collect.

902
00:58:39,319 --> 00:58:41,945
Don't be too hard on her, Bill.
- I said I've got to collect.

903
00:58:42,045 --> 00:58:43,419
Mrs Burgess wants to see you.

904
00:58:43,667 --> 00:58:44,396
Alright.

905
00:58:48,330 --> 00:58:50,038
Good afternoon, Mrs Burgess.
- Good afternoon.

906
00:58:50,138 --> 00:58:51,411
Come right up to my office.

907
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:55,360
Hello there.

908
00:58:56,291 --> 00:58:56,985
Hello.

909
00:58:57,085 --> 00:58:58,272
You're not sore are you?

910
00:58:58,842 --> 00:59:00,318
I mean, about the little girl.

911
00:59:00,418 --> 00:59:02,302
I'm sorry I couldn't see it your way.

912
00:59:03,031 --> 00:59:04,690
But never give a sucker a break.

913
00:59:05,446 --> 00:59:06,404
She had her fun.

914
00:59:06,883 --> 00:59:08,585
And her husband can
afford to pay for it.

915
00:59:08,708 --> 00:59:09,809
But she's such a kid.

916
00:59:10,345 --> 00:59:11,761
Well, maybe it will do her good.

917
00:59:12,012 --> 00:59:13,285
It will teach her a lesson.

918
00:59:13,684 --> 00:59:14,904
That's what I'm hoping.

919
00:59:15,004 --> 00:59:15,962
That's the girl.

920
00:59:16,327 --> 00:59:18,619
Now you're too clever a woman
to worry about those things.

921
00:59:19,049 --> 00:59:21,131
You know what I said to
myself when I first saw you?

922
00:59:21,805 --> 00:59:23,154
I said .. there is a woman ..

923
00:59:23,544 --> 00:59:24,788
That a man with a heart ..

924
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:26,128
And ambition ..

925
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,583
Could make a lot out of.

926
00:59:28,765 --> 00:59:29,486
Thanks.

927
00:59:34,991 --> 00:59:36,979
This is just as unpleasant
for me as it is for you.

928
00:59:37,379 --> 00:59:39,477
The fact remains that you lost $15,000.

929
00:59:39,927 --> 00:59:42,101
I accepted your IOUs and
I have to make them good.

930
00:59:42,201 --> 00:59:44,452
I'll pay you every cent. I promise you.
- When?

931
00:59:45,034 --> 00:59:47,828
Well .. I wont have any money of my
own for another six months you see.

932
00:59:48,032 --> 00:59:50,564
Do you expect me to wait until
then? I want the money now.

933
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:52,569
I can't give it to you now.
I haven't got it.

934
00:59:52,669 --> 00:59:54,011
Well get it.
- But where?

935
00:59:54,111 --> 00:59:55,123
From your husband.

936
00:59:55,223 --> 00:59:56,373
You don't understand.

937
00:59:56,473 --> 00:59:58,879
He swore he'd divorce me if I ever
gambled again. He would too.

938
00:59:58,979 --> 01:00:01,533
My dear, you should think of those
things next time you go gambling.

939
01:00:01,633 --> 01:00:02,841
There won't be a next time.

940
01:00:02,941 --> 01:00:05,169
My dear Mrs Burgess,
we're not getting anywhere.

941
01:00:05,365 --> 01:00:07,831
I want $15,000.
You say you can't pay it.

942
01:00:08,519 --> 01:00:11,080
Shall I phone your husband or will you?
- Please don't do that. Please.

943
01:00:13,155 --> 01:00:14,600
You don't know what you're doing.

944
01:00:16,132 --> 01:00:16,868
Hello?

945
01:00:17,243 --> 01:00:19,317
Give me another few days
at least before you tell him.

946
01:00:19,565 --> 01:00:21,430
I want to speak to a
Mr Henry Burgess please.

947
01:00:22,591 --> 01:00:23,750
No, he doesn't know me.

948
01:00:24,126 --> 01:00:25,610
It's personal and very important.

949
01:00:26,591 --> 01:00:27,435
What's that?

950
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:30,194
Stop it I tell you. Stop it!

951
01:00:32,752 --> 01:00:34,719
Stop it I tell you! Stop it!

952
01:00:36,192 --> 01:00:37,036
[ Gunshot! ]

953
01:00:57,208 --> 01:00:58,806
He was telephoning my husband.

954
01:00:59,347 --> 01:01:00,277
Wait out there.

955
01:01:07,538 --> 01:01:09,197
Bill .. Bill ..

956
01:02:11,339 --> 01:02:12,412
The drawer was open.

957
01:02:12,803 --> 01:02:13,876
I saw the gun there.

958
01:02:13,976 --> 01:02:15,273
I reached for it.
- Stop!

959
01:02:15,373 --> 01:02:16,477
But you don't know.

960
01:02:17,134 --> 01:02:18,378
That's what my mother did.

961
01:02:18,812 --> 01:02:20,791
She shot a man.
Killed him and went to prison.

962
01:02:21,241 --> 01:02:22,400
Died there.
- Stop it.

963
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,294
Now listen. I must get you out of here.

964
01:02:24,394 --> 01:02:25,423
Oh, but I can't.

965
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:26,812
I've killed him.

966
01:02:26,912 --> 01:02:28,880
He's not dead. And lucky
enough for both of you.

967
01:02:29,176 --> 01:02:30,478
How soon can you leave town?

968
01:02:31,758 --> 01:02:33,031
We were going away tonight.

969
01:02:34,037 --> 01:02:36,342
My husband and I were
sailing for Europe at twelve.

970
01:02:38,355 --> 01:02:39,204
But now ..

971
01:02:39,473 --> 01:02:40,632
I'll take care of that.

972
01:02:43,144 --> 01:02:45,533
I'm not going to have your life
ruined the way your mother's was.

973
01:02:48,247 --> 01:02:50,072
I never expected you to be my friend.

974
01:02:52,387 --> 01:02:55,329
Perhaps one day you'll look back and see
that I was the best friend you ever had.

975
01:02:59,856 --> 01:03:00,614
Now then.

976
01:03:00,991 --> 01:03:02,579
Take these things and get out of here.

977
01:03:29,671 --> 01:03:31,543
Are you ready, Madame?
- Just a moment.

978
01:03:44,182 --> 01:03:44,854
Ready?

979
01:03:56,222 --> 01:03:57,345
Is Blaine inside?

980
01:03:57,818 --> 01:03:58,815
No, he went out.

981
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:01,270
I've got a wad of dough I
want to put in the safe.

982
01:04:01,746 --> 01:04:03,162
He locked the door when he left.

983
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:04,844
I got a passkey.

984
01:04:06,618 --> 01:04:07,977
Barney, take this deal for me.

985
01:04:08,416 --> 01:04:09,689
Excuse me please, will you.

986
01:04:12,758 --> 01:04:15,090
Bill won't like it if you open
the safe without him being here.

987
01:04:15,765 --> 01:04:17,626
Well, that's just too bad.

988
01:04:41,668 --> 01:04:42,426
I did it.

989
01:04:43,944 --> 01:04:46,632
I wondered if maybe
Mrs Burgess didn't bump him off?

990
01:04:47,082 --> 01:04:48,298
You can forget about her.

991
01:04:49,058 --> 01:04:49,767
Can I?

992
01:04:54,315 --> 01:04:55,903
Sit down.
- What are you going to do?

993
01:04:56,664 --> 01:04:58,491
Wait here until I get
rid of the customers.

994
01:06:43,778 --> 01:06:44,880
How did it happen?

995
01:06:46,044 --> 01:06:47,517
I told him I was through with him.

996
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:49,320
And he squawked?

997
01:06:50,289 --> 01:06:50,904
Yes.

998
01:06:51,604 --> 01:06:52,562
He pulled a gun.

999
01:06:53,542 --> 01:06:54,507
We struggled.

1000
01:06:55,407 --> 01:06:56,508
And the gun went off?

1001
01:06:57,625 --> 01:06:58,607
That's too bad.

1002
01:07:00,032 --> 01:07:02,651
You had plenty of nerve to come
back here and deal at this table.

1003
01:07:02,925 --> 01:07:04,483
Instead of making a run for it.

1004
01:07:05,763 --> 01:07:06,879
I had my reasons.

1005
01:07:07,783 --> 01:07:09,142
What do you plan on doing now?

1006
01:07:10,847 --> 01:07:12,021
I don't know exactly.

1007
01:07:13,042 --> 01:07:14,311
I did plan to leave town.

1008
01:07:15,009 --> 01:07:16,301
You don't have to.

1009
01:07:17,623 --> 01:07:19,068
I can take care of Blaine.

1010
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:21,400
A couple of boys will
drop him out of  car ..

1011
01:07:21,602 --> 01:07:23,014
The police will just say ..

1012
01:07:23,299 --> 01:07:25,042
Another guy taken for a ride.

1013
01:07:25,431 --> 01:07:26,241
You know.

1014
01:07:26,533 --> 01:07:27,975
I can't afford to lose you.

1015
01:07:29,376 --> 01:07:31,057
And you can't afford to go.

1016
01:07:34,788 --> 01:07:36,975
You and I can make plenty
of real money together.

1017
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,505
And I'd like to have you stay here.

1018
01:07:41,811 --> 01:07:42,600
Always.

1019
01:07:48,470 --> 01:07:50,089
I never want to leave ths house.

1020
01:07:50,570 --> 01:07:51,962
I want to live here always.

1021
01:07:53,374 --> 01:07:54,402
So you shall.

1022
01:08:00,982 --> 01:08:01,976
And so I shall.

1023
01:08:05,629 --> 01:08:06,713
So I shall.

1024
01:08:15,589 --> 01:08:16,708
T-G
