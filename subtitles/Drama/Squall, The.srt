Tell it to the dolphin, Preston.

160
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:44,615
He deserves another chance.

161
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:48,456
We'd do the same for you.
You know that.

162
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:51,463
You do whatever you want, Gil.
All right?

163
00:13:51,531 --> 00:13:55,763
It's not gonna make
any difference anyway.

164
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:02,702
- The dolphin was a symptom.
- Of what?

165
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:06,336
Of a fight he can't win out here.

166
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:09,870
- But, sir, it's his father.
- It's his father, sir.

167
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:13,646
- Oh, it's his father. Mm-hmm.
- H-He, he sent him down here.

168
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:17,086
All of them.
They sent us down here because...

169
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:21,115
they want us to change or grow up
or something, and all they do
is try and keep us the same.

170
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:23,958
I mean, h-he has
all these expectations...

171
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,557
about who his son should be,
and he doesn't even know who Frank is.

172
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:30,693
How do you think you got here?
Do you think they owe you something?

173
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:34,035
Do you think they enjoy riding
subways and commuter trains?

174
00:14:34,106 --> 00:14:37,803
The same repetition day in and day out
just to keep you in tennis shoes...

175
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,971
and private school?

176
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:44,744
You know, there are ground rules
in families just like on this ship.

177
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:48,514
You can understand that.

178
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:54,882
Does Frank know
how you guys feel?

179
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:58,263
I don't know.

180
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:02,932
Well, somebody should tell him.

181
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:04,594
That's it.

182
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,941
Well, I'm all ears.

183
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:23,978
- You may not like what you hear.
- Oh, I can take it.

184
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:26,183
Chris, they've become
what we wanted.

185
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,854
They're a crew.
That's why they came.

186
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,397
Do you remember why
we began this?

187
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:35,161
Self-reliance and discipline
through the community of sailing.

188
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,429
- I haven't forgotten.
- Mmm. Community.

189
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:40,165
That boy doesn't know
the meaning of the word.

190
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:43,333
So, the best thing you can do
is to keep him right here.

191
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:47,072
- He has a lot of problems.
- He better start to learn
to deal with them.

192
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:50,206
[Sighs]
Oh, Captain Compassionate speaks.

193
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:52,615
It's not about compassion.
It's not about what happens here.

194
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:55,449
- It's about what
they take away with them.
- He was coming around.

195
00:15:55,521 --> 00:15:58,615
He was coming apart!
He lost control out there!

196
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:01,159
And what is so important
about being in control?

197
00:16:01,227 --> 00:16:05,220
- He's just gonna have
to figure that out, isn't he?
- I'm not talking about him.

198

[Horn Honking]

199
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,770
[Chuck Narrating]
We watched in silent protest.

200
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:26,579
Aboard ship, the low morale
was matched only by the feeling...

201
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,280
that maybe Skipper was no different
than our own fathers back home.

202
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,691
We'll miss Frank.

203
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,464
Jesus!

204
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:09,725
Yeah, I'm... I'm sorry.

[Gil]
Bye, Frankie!

I got a problem, man.

216
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:46,585
- We all have problems.
- No. A big problem.

217
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:52,725
I'm pissing fire.

218
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,426
Fire?

219
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,435
Fire.

220

Hmm.

221
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:05,801
Had a good time in Grenada,
did you, Tod?

222
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:09,507
Yeah. I did, actually.
Thanks for askin'.

223
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:12,574
Turn around.

224

Ow! Ow.

Way to go, Valentino.

230
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,783
I never even copped a feel
in Grenada.

231
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:50,618
Well, your sexual orientation
is not my problem.

What do you make of it, Skipper?

Are they gonna sink us?

[Commander Speaking Spanish]

244

They want us
to identify ourselves.

Tell them we're the American
school ship Albatross.

[Girard] They think we're
carrying Cuban refugees, Captain.

250
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:10,133
I don't think they're going to take it
lightly that I'm a Cuban national.

251
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:14,002
Nothing's going to happen.
Remind them that according
to the Geneva Convention...

252
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:18,305
firing on citizens on the high seas
is an act of war.

He left his passport in Grenada.
It's being mailed to him in Panama.

Now you will really have something
to teach your students, Captain.

Las estrellas...

302

es lo unico que un marinero
necessita para navegar.

00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:02,096
What'd he say?

304
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:06,797
He says a real sailor only needs
the stars to navigate with.

[Chuck Narrating] And so he guided us
silently through the convoy of warships.

307
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:19,744
And we later learned they were bound
for a little known destination...

308
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:22,912
called the Bay of Pigs.

309
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:25,479
As we rode the trades,
he shared the ancient secrets...

310
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:29,084
of how to read the waves
and follow the stars.

311
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:32,528
Panama and the Americas
rose and fell away again.

312

With the locks of Miraflores
and a continent behind us,

All right, Captain Sanders,
you may begin.

633

The Albatross.

00:56:59,719 --> 00:57:02,187
The Albatross.

635
00:57:02,255 --> 00:57:06,055
By all accounts, a sound vessel.

636
00:57:02,255 --> 00:57:06,055
By all accounts, a sound vessel.

637

An experienced captain,
an able crew.

638

An experienced captain,
an able crew.

639
00:57:10,129 --> 00:57:12,996
And yet it lies out there
on the bottom...

640
00:57:10,129 --> 00:57:12,996
And yet it lies out there
on the bottom...

641
00:57:13,066 --> 00:57:17,969
in 2,000 fathoms
with its back broken.

our most serious consideration...

644

so that we might understand,
so that perhaps...

646
00:57:23,409 --> 00:57:26,572
so that we might understand,
so that perhaps...

647
00:57:26,646 --> 00:57:30,776

00:57:34,287 --> 00:57:37,848
A one in a million
meteorological anomaly?

652

Or was it inexperience,
misjudgment?

Is it true that the reason
you expelled Frank Beaumont...

01:01:51,177 --> 01:01:53,805
You say you turned hard
to starboard when the gust hit.

788
01:01:51,177 --> 01:01:53,805
You say you turned hard
to starboard when the gust hit.

789
01:01:53,879 --> 01:01:56,814
I thought we'd have a better chance
if I headed into the wind.

790
01:01:53,879 --> 01:01:56,814
I thought we'd have a better chance
if I headed into the wind.

791
01:01:56,882 --> 01:01:59,646
But the captain ordered you
hard to port.

792
01:01:56,882 --> 01:01:59,646
But the captain ordered you
hard to port.

793
01:01:59,719 --> 01:02:01,619
- Twice.
- I'm sorry?

794
01:01:59,719 --> 01:02:01,619
- Twice.
- I'm sorry?

795
01:02:01,687 --> 01:02:05,487
- Twice!
- Is that what you were trained to do?

796
01:02:01,687 --> 01:02:05,487
- Twice!
- Is that what you were trained to do?

797
01:02:05,558 --> 01:02:07,458
No.

798
01:02:05,558 --> 01:02:07,458
No.

799
01:02:07,526 --> 01:02:10,791
- Speak up, son. I can't hear you.
- I said, "No."

800
01:02:07,526 --> 01:02:10,791
- Speak up, son. I can't hear you.
- I said, "No."

801
01:02:10,863 --> 01:02:13,889
And what did you think
he was trying to do?

802
01:02:10,863 --> 01:02:13,889
And what did you think
he was trying to do?

803
01:02:13,966 --> 01:02:16,833
Put her off. To let the blow
drive the boat downwind.

804
01:02:13,966 --> 01:02:16,833
Put her off. To let the blow
drive the boat downwind.

805
01:02:16,902 --> 01:02:20,099
By the "blow" you're referring to
the force of the storm. Is that right?

806
01:02:16,902 --> 01:02:20,099
By the "blow" you're referring to
the force of the storm. Is that right?

807
01:02:20,172 --> 01:02:24,302
Let the blow drive the boat downwind,
and neutralize our canvas.

808
01:02:20,172 --> 01:02:24,302
Let the blow drive the boat downwind,
and neutralize our canvas.

809
01:02:24,377 --> 01:02:27,107
So when the captain gave you an order
contrary to your training,

810
01:02:24,377 --> 01:02:27,107
So when the captain gave you an order
contrary to your training,

811
01:02:27,179 --> 01:02:29,306
you thought
he was making a mistake.

812
01:02:27,179 --> 01:02:29,306
you thought
he was making a mistake.

813
01:02:30,850 --> 01:02:33,375
No.

814
01:02:30,850 --> 01:02:33,375
No.

815
01:02:33,452 --> 01:02:37,479
Then why... son?
Why didn't you follow his order?

816
01:02:33,452 --> 01:02:37,479
Then why... son?
Why didn't you follow his order?

817
01:02:37,556 --> 01:02:40,389
Because...

818
01:02:37,556 --> 01:02:40,389
Because...

821
01:02:42,762 --> 01:02:45,026
I panicked.

01:02:42,762 --> 01:02:45,026
I panicked.

823
01:02:45,097 --> 01:02:48,032
You know that's not true, Tod!

If you think I'm gonna let a

The Albatross was my ship.

The Albatross was my ship.

If you want my ticket,

some reason now for why this happened,

just pin it on one person?

They didn't take his ticket today.

Today he joined the circle he created

The burden of sea captains

You face the music,
you trim your sails, and keep going.
