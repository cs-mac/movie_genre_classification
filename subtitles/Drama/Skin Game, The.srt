1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,000
PAINTED SKIN

2
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:46,690
Hey... come on!.

3
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,280
Beauty!

4
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,820
are you hungry?

5
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,700
What would you like to eat?

6
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:33,610
Congratulations, boss ...

7
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:42,910
Say it and I'll get you whatever you want!

8
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,620
Really?

9
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,650
My heart is now yours.

10
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:57,290
Oh... so I can have it

11
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,340
It's on fire ...

12
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:44,780
Sneak attack! Chase them...

13
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,620
Shoot!

14
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,830
It is bad, boss!

15
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,660
Come on. I'll take you away.

16
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,720
Come on.

17
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,970
Hold me tight!

18
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:29,310
Sacrifice our lives!

19
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:32,410
For the sake of our parents!

20
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:35,550
Spill our blood!

21
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:38,580
For the sake of our home!

22
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,860
Walk a million miles!

23
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,350
And kill the bandits of the desert!

24
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,390
To save the beauty!

25
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:04,480
They're back! They're back, the 
General is back!

26
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:33,780
We saved her just.

27
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,550
Her parents are dead.

28
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,860
Why has she disappeared?
Someone's knocking on the door?

29
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,810
Open the door!

30
00:08:58,930 --> 00:08:59,900
Mistress!

31
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,260
Mistress!

32
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:05,200
Can't we just send him again? 
See who's....

33
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,500
Bullshit!.

34
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,740
We're brothers.

35
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,780
And it's New Year.

36
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,750
Who?

37
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:19,580
He's back.

38
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:28,120
You're all here?

39
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:28,890
Miss Xiaowei.

40
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,760
It's so cold outside.

41
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,160
Drink some hot water.
Give it to me!

42
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,720
Have some flower cakes!.

43
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,600
Okay, thank you.

44
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,730
Thanks, Miss Xiaowei.

45
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,290
Brother Gao Xiang, drink whlie it's hot.

46
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,200
So attentive!

47
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:46,200
Who is this man?

48
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,910
He...

49
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,600
Right there!

50
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,680
General...

51
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,350
General...

52
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:39,850
General, are you okay?

53
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,090
Why didn't you wait for us?

54
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,220
General...

55
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,160
Have you gone mad?

56
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,660
Hundreds of gangsters here!.

57
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,890
You said,

58
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,240
we're all brothers who'd die together.

59
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,960
We must all go home alive!

60
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,180
I'll never lead you.

61
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:13,280
Brother Young!

62
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,330
General... Brother Yong...

63
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:16,260
Freeze!

64
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,800
You won't! A soldier like you
can't go as you wish!

65
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:24,170
This is desertion and the penalty
is death!

66
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:24,970
No.

67
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:25,800
No...

68
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,770
Get away!

69
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:27,870
Leave me!

70
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:35,950
Everybody, take care,

71
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:44,190
General … Brother Yong …

72
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:59,500
Have you contacted him?

73
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:01,930
No!

74
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,200
Don't you want him to come back?

75
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,340
Of course I do.

76
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:11,280
Perhaps he can catch the guy who...
tore the hearts out.

77
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,520
I just never thought.

78
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:22,060
he'd be dejected like this.

79
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:27,890
I've never blamed him,
he must have his reasons

80
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,940
Be carefull

81
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,900
I can't live without you

82
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,210
Be carefull

83
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:47,010
Not woken up yet?

84
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:51,900
No.

85
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,250
Let me get you some tea.

86
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,260
Peirong, I haven't slept a wink for days

87
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,940
Peirong... I've drunk too much!

88
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:20,970
Brother Yong.

89
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,370
You've woken up.

90
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,990
Sorry.

91
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,320
Thanks!

92
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,090
I'm going!

93
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:48,660
Brother Yong.

94
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,740
Hey brother!

95
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:03,050
It's New Year's Eve.
At least stay with us for the...

96
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,180
No, thanks!.

97
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:07,420
Brother Yong, just wait a moment

98
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,490
I've got something to return to you .

99
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,970
Brother Yong, your sword...

100
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,010
I wish you good luck!

101
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,800
Waiter, any spare rooms?

102
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,460
Yes, sure...

103
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:03,000
Please pay a deposit a the counter first, sir

104
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,810
I'm leaving my horse here
and... do you think I'll run away?

105
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,780
Okay, fine...

106
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,550
Waiter, don't forget to look after my horse!

107
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:17,120
I will, I guarantee it. Rest assured!

108
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,810
Please pay a deposit first, sir.

109
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,640
I'm leaving my horse here
and...you think I'll run away?

110
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,310
Take care of my horse!

111
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:42,040
I will.

112
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,750
Take care, sir.
Happy new year!

113
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,810
Let's go!

114
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:51,760
Waiter, it's a big inn , nothing more than that.

115
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,850
Not even a slice of meat?

116
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:56,090
They have all gone home for new year,
so has the chef...

117
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,690
Let it be... any wine?

118
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,700
Sure,...I'll get it now!

119
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,270
A bottle of best spring liquor!

120
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,830
Sir, it's just sold out!

121
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,610
She's taken all the rest.

122
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,140
Sir, please choose another

123
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,650
Come here. Be my guest!

124
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:19,840
Please!

125
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:30,560
Waiter!

126
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,330
Waiter, one more bottle!

127
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,530
Waiter, ...

128
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,740
No need... Here.

129
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:59,890
I'll give this pair of jade pendants 
to the one you love...

130
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:18,840
How are you doing?

131
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:22,210
Where have you been the last two years?

132
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,640
You're here just to ask such dull questions?.

133
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:33,250
I suspect if there's a demon in our house.

134
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,250
three months ago...

135
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:40,860
When Brother Sheng was back after 
encountering bandits in the desert.

136
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,330
he rescued a young woman with 
nowhere to stay.

137
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:45,500
Sister sister!

138
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,870
She is Xiaowei.

139
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:52,540
She claimed to be the daughter of Gao Kun.
a wealthy silk businessman.

140
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:57,410
Her parents were framed
and killed by corrupt officials.

141
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:59,540
and she was sold to the bandits...

142
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:04,990
Tell me...

143
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:08,860
So many people love Xiaowei.
Who will she go for?

144
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,260
How do I know what's in a woman's heart?.

145
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:13,990
Suddenly!

146
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:19,470
there appeared an assassin in the city who tore out
the hearts of so many.

147
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:21,240
The new magistrate has not yet come.

148
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,400
But there can't be a city without law.

149
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,410
Brothers, we will now take charge of the city

150
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,210
Until the new magistrate takes up his post.

151
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:29,810
Are you ready?

152
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,610
The assassin keeps killing!
Ready!

153
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:34,950
Nobody can deal with it.
Go!

154
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:38,360
The only thing he can do is step up
the patrols every night.

155
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,990
Then some times later,.

156
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:45,230
people start to doubt if they're 
all the work of evil demons.

157
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:49,570
There is the pearl powder.
New arrival.

158
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:50,430
Do you want to try it?

159
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:57,640
Miss, what you want is this, right?

160
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,470
Why should I buy this?

161
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,440
You have to

162
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,250
I'll take them all!

163
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,350
You've got to put on makeup!

164
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,320
Sure, I have to put on makeup.

165
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,300
This way, please.

166
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:28,370
Is she really an evil demon?

167
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,500
I can't help you.

168
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,750
Let me find you a man of power.

169
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,840
Stay back. Back off...

170
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,610
The Taoist is dead, with his heart dug out ...

171
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:39,920
The killer is a big tall guy.

172
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,360
Xiaonou, hand me the medical kit!

173
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,330
Xiaowei is hurt!

174
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:50,630
Sister!

175
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:53,590
You didn't cut myself. See, I'm fine.

176
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:57,790
Impossible! I clearly saw her wound!

177
00:22:58,570 --> 00:22:59,870
What are you talking about?

178
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,940
She is not an evil demon, is she?

179
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,380
She's nice and charming.

180
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,410
But how could she really be?.

181
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,690
Only you can.... understand me.

182
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:27,590
I've sent you so many letters,
I don't know if you got them.

183
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:28,970
What is up now?

184
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,830
Now she's become...

185
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,770
more friendly with everyone.

186
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:39,410
and she's getting very close to Brother Sheng!

187
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:40,850
Does anyone know you suspect she's a demon?

188
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,850
How dare I tell anyone else?.

189
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,910
No one would believe me!

190
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,860
Demon?

191
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,530
You don't believe me brother?

192
00:23:58,530 --> 00:23:59,930
Of cause I do!

193
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:02,490
When did I ever disbelieve you?

194
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,540
What do you want me to do?

195
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,070
Find out the truth!

196
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:15,480
What if she's really not a demon?

197
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,570
Then I'll admit I'm wrong..

198
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,550
Please, Brother Yong!

199
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:25,650
Do you have any money?

200
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,790
Find me if you don't have enough.

201
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,130
Lend me some money.

202
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,470
No money? But you invited me for a drink!

203
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,500
You enjoyed it too, didn't you?

204
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,910
I've sliced them for you from six humans.

205
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,940
Why kill so many? How do I eat them 
all at once?

206
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,950
That's for you to choose. 
It's just a few

207
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,950
I don't mean to feel
bad for them.

208
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:29,790
But you've made a lot of work for 
Wang Sheng..

209
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:32,220
I hardly see him these days

210
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,100
You're so disgusting!

211
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,670
You're wasting your time.

212
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,070
He will love me.

213
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,980
Why don't you just be his mistress?

214
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:55,680
What I want to be is his wife!

215
00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:01,890
Listen, I shall be Mrs.Wang!

216
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:04,690
So you want to give up your training?

217
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,620
I have plenty of time.

218
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,750
But your skin won't wait.

219
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:12,530
You need more hearts to keep your human
skin from rotting.

220
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:18,800

Yes! Therefore, I've got to find a way out,

221
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,700
so I can stop myself eating human hearts!

222
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:33,920
Hurry up!

223
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:36,520
Be careful.

224
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,860
Didn't I say you should wait for me?.

225
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,060
Miss Xiaowei said ...

226
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,860
Master's irritated so we must
hurry to give out the dishes.

227
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,320
Let me do it!

228
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:52,970
Sister- in -law!

229
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:55,270
Sister- in -law!

230
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:56,280
Mistress!

231
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,020
Start the meal!

232
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:07,720
Start the meal!

233
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:16,890
Let me do it..

234
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,340
Where have you just been?

235
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,670
Everybody is waiting for you.

236
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,940
I've ...

237
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,380
Brother Wang, don't be upset with her.

238
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,220
Sister Peirong went to the beauty shop...

239
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,980
for some lavender.

240
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,160
to put under your pillow in a bag.

241
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:49,860
so you can sleep well.

242
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,690
It's New Year now.

243
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,900
Don't worry too much.

244
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:00,740
I know.

245
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:08,850
Sister!

246
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,380
Are you looking for this?

247
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:22,790
I must thank you today.

248
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,400
I'll give it to Brother Sheng!

249
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,270
I know who you've been to see.

250
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:45,780
I won't tell Brother Wang.

251
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,130
Something is actually not
what you think.

252
00:28:55,930 --> 00:28:56,900
Anyway...

253
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:02,130
I'll tell you more
about us later.

254
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:04,890
It's good as long as you're happy.
Have a rest!

255
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,290
The dead bodies whose hearts
are removed are all here

256
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:44,130
Brother Sheng has run out of ideas
so our Wang's Squadron... ...

257
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,470
can only patrol every night

258
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:46,310
Wang's Squadron?

259
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:51,640
You're left for so long. Should we now
call it "Pang's Squadron"?

260
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,880
Wow.

261
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,790
This man is a real pro!

262
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,330
So accurate that he dug out the heart
in a single cut!

263
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,130
So I told Brother Sheng this

264
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:12,530
couldn't be done by a human.
You really believe in demons?

265
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:14,800
If I were a Yin Yang Practitioner 
I surely would ...

266
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,830
A demon, a demon here!

267
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:20,310
Look at yourself. You believe in any crap!

268
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,780
What do you not believe,
Yin Yang Practitioner ?

269
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,710
Also, I suspect one person...

270
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:28,310
The woman Brother Sheng brought here,
Xiaowei.

271
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:31,450
Don't you love her?

272
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:32,350
I'm not sure!

273
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,260
You suspect her?

274
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,890
The killing spree began once she arrived.

275
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,690
I really feel the evil emanating from her...

276
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:39,290
She has a suspicious background 

277
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:40,660
Enough! You can set up a booth out there
and fool the guys!

278
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:43,290
Get off! you feel good staying in a coffin?

279
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:44,460
Get off!

280
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,340
What he says is correct!

281
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,580
All done by evil demons!

282
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,400
I too think evil demons did this!

283
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,180
Don't listen to her foolish talk!
It's all nonsense!

284
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,550
What foolish talk? I've seen this before.

285
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,980
There are many demons in this world.

286
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:04,480
Some are transformed from flowers, 
grass and trees...

287
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,490
some from tigers, wolves, 
snakes and foxes......

288
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,990
and some from love and hatred...

289
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,560
Some are good, some are bad...
... No kidding!

290
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,190
Demons kill with a sword?

291
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:15,730
Why do assassins kill humans for their hearts?

292
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,700
What's your name? You seem very sure?

293
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:22,670
My name is Xia Bing.

294
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,970
I'm a Demon Hunter.

295
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,530
My name is Pang Yong.

296
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,280
I don't believe in demons.

297
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:36,020
This sealed part of the fox tail will direct us
to the Beautiful Fox from the Sky.

298
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:40,420
Once it senses a fox spirit in the vicinity, 
it glares.

299
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:43,450
This is what brought me here.

300
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:46,430
I'm sure the demon is still in this city.

301
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:48,630
Can you sense where the demon is?

302
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,340
Within a ten mile radius of here.

303
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,800
The entire city is only some ten miles long.

304
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,780
I've made a box for you.

305
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:09,510
Put the hearts inside and they'll be kept fresh.

306
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,390
Just put it there.

307
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:18,890
Brother Sheng asked me to draw the 
heart thief.. I must do it well.

308
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,540
Remember that old man named Xia
who cut you?

309
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,800
Isn't he dead?

310
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:33,300
His granddaughter is here in town!

311
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,880
Damn it. Their family will never let me go!

312
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,480
Shall I kill her for you!

313
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,680
Yes!

314
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,850
Such a big range!

315
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,590
This is the last place!

316
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:48,350
I've spent all my money on the case.

317
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:50,360
The Taoist priest died right here!

318
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,090
Also!

319
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,830
all the murders occured on the 
east side of the city.

320
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:56,800
Look...

321
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:02,770
Not only that, they all died around the 
commander's house!

322
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:03,540
Exactly!

323
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,430
So what do we do next?

324
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:06,450
Nothing to do with you.

325
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,410
Miss, this is an official matter.

326
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:10,680
I think you needn't ask.

327
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,850
He doesn't work for the government,
either!

328
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,450
Nothing to do with you as well.

329
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,520
Hey, where are you going?

330
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,120
Nothing to do with you!

331
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:28,630
Hey……

332
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,330
I've used up my money!

333
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,370
Are you okay?

334
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,100
You're that demon?

335
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,600
Don't fool around!

336
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,380
You wanna run?

337
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,190
You go over there!

338
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:34,190
Leave me alone! Get him!

339
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,770
Waiter! Waiter!

340
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:01,180
Stop shouting. It's new year's day. Everybody's gone.

341
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,970
Have you come to drink or heal me?

342
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:25,270
Don't panic. its just a small wound.

343
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:29,610
What are you doing?

344
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,170
Why didn't you tell me you'd blow?

345
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,810
I had wine in my mouth. I couldn't tell you.

346
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:40,280
Have you seen enough?

347
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:41,280
Don't move!

348
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:44,260
What?

349
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,600
What...you...?

350
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,540
Carefully…Carefully…

351
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:53,300
Be quiet.

352
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,840
It was done with a sword!

353
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,070
Demons can't use swords

354
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,200
Who say they can't?

355
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,340
Carefully, Carefully…

356
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,880
How do you deal with them?

357
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,980
Ordinary demons can be finished 
with a single slash!

358
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,290
What if they're not ordinary?

359
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:23,300
This is the "Demon....?”.

360
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:25,960
My grandfather told me that...

361
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:30,670
its power is limitless when its
inside a capable person.

362
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:33,280
That person is surely not you!

363
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,710
I can't take it out.

364
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:01,900
Not me, either.

365
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,010
I think your grandpa
also couldn't.

366
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:09,740
Sure! How do you know?

367
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,750
You don't believe my words?

368
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:19,410
Yes.. yes.. I dare not disbelieve!

369
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,130
Don't get caught.

370
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:42,150
I would have killed the girl if
It weren't for...

371
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:47,250
So she was really helped from her old lover.

372
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:55,420
Where did you go?

373
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:59,250
I.. I just help in the reading room…

374
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:02,960
You better go to the kitchen now.

375
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,800
Yes!

376
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,240
Brother Young, I've checked it.

377
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,870
There is a rich man called Gao Kun 
in another city.

378
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:09,970
The whole family died during a
disease epidemic 3 years ago.

379
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:12,270
He doesn't have a daughter,
She tells lies!

380
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:17,250
Peirung, where's Xiaowei?

381
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,480
In the beauty shop.

382
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,810
Brother Yong, what do you find her for?

383
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:22,690
She's not what she claimed to be!

384
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:25,380
You've brought a demon home!

385
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,220
Demon?

386
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:30,990
Brother Yong, do you believe 
a rumour like this?

387
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,130
I just want to find out the truth.

388
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,230
Truth....Fine.

389
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:39,060
I'll take you there to see the truth.

390
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:43,970
The Gao family has no daughter! 
Who are you?

391
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,140
Xiahou Xiang is known to be wrong all the time?

392
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,810
Has he misunderstood you?

393
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:51,250
That's right! Miss Xiaowei,
just go ahead,

394
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:52,440
tell us your problems!

395
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,110
Xiaowei, don't be scared!

396
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,780
Tell us everything.

397
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:06,490
I'm actually not the Gao family's daughter.

398
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:09,400
I'm only…

399
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,200
the maid.

400
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:18,810
But I love being with you and don't want
you to look down upon me.

401
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:22,470
That's why I made up such a stupid story.

402
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:25,280
Can anyone else verify what you said?

403
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,280
No.

404
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:30,980
We can!

405
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:33,290
We rescued her from the lair 
of the desert bandits.

406
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:35,850
She'd have died if..
it weren't for us!

407
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,120
Yes… yes. Sure! We rescued her...…

408
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,060
Brother Wang...

409
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,990
I did tell lies.

410
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:44,000
But please don't banish me! Will you?

411
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,400
I don't want to be alone.

412
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:48,940
Get up.

413
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:52,500
With me here, nobody dare bully you.

414
00:40:58,350 --> 00:40:59,440
I'll chop your hands off and see
if you're a demon!.

415
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:00,880
Brother Yong.

416
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,320
what are you doing? Are you crazy?

417
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,260
I was just teasing her.... 
It's the back of the blade.

418
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:11,350
I don't care what tricks you played.
Xiaowei is my family!

419
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,100
Your family... so what about Peirong?

420
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:18,470
Peirong is your wife!
She's been worried about you every day!

421
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:21,800
Brother Yong.

422
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:26,370
You still care that Peirong had chosen me!

423
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:28,250
Bastard!

424
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,340
I'm not happy.

425
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,810
Peirong has chosen the wrong one!

426
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:34,320
You cold-hearted thing!

427
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,880
They're already married.
I think you'd better give up.

428
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,020
Shut up!

429
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:43,260
Obsessed by that woman!
You've never seen a woman?

430
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,520
Pang Yong!

431
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:47,600
It's my private matter. Not yours!

432
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,260
I must care about the demon's case.

433
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:57,030
This is a section of tail from a fox spirit

434
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:01,570
Whenever a demon shows up, it glares.

435
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:15,080
It's always glaring. So we are all demons?

436
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:19,290
I'm the Demon Hunter... Everything I said is real!

437
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:22,130
I don't believe it... Who does?

438
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:23,260
The ghosts do!

439
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:26,900
I do!

440
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,340
I saw it with my own eyes!

441
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:34,210
She knows black magic.

442
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:37,540
I hurt her hand by accident!

443
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,110
and it healed at once.

444
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:48,060
Later I told this to the Taoist priest.

445
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:52,560
He said you're a demon with great power.

446
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:58,530
On the very next day, he died…

447
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:07,410
I've been staying with you, I know more
than anyone else.

448
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:11,440
I have an idea.

449
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:16,690
Thre's a mark on each demon

450
00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:20,290
like a human's birthmark.

451
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:25,250
Dare you let us examine you?

452
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:29,390
Demon, are you scared?

453
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,430
Dare you?

454
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:35,270
I dare!

455
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,600
I do as long as you won't suspect me!

456
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,530
Satisfied?

457
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:44,310
Nothing to do with her. They're all my ideas

458
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,610
I still have one more idea.

459
00:44:48,610 --> 00:44:49,710
Are you finished?

460
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:55,550
For a fox spirit to sustain the human form,
it must eat human hearts.

461
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:58,710
which is why there're so many deaths
with their hearts removed.

462
00:44:58,710 --> 00:45:00,020
Are you finished?.

463
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:02,720
Sure… Are you wasting our time?

464
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,760
What you mean is…

465
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,030
if she has no heart to eat,
she'll reveal her true form?

466
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:18,270
Let's watch Miss Xiaowei for a while.

467
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:24,740
See if she'll become a demon with
no hearts to eat

468
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:30,650
I must let you know that you're wrong!

469
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,350
Get in!

470
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:42,230
I understand that!

471
00:45:43,370 --> 00:45:45,360
You're just concerned about me.

472
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,700
I'm sorry!

473
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:56,540
You should apologize to Xiaowei!

474
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:25,570
I'm so sorry…

475
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:28,580
I'm so sorry for you sister!

476
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:32,810
I know why you suspect that I'm a demon.

477
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,590
You're worried I'll steal Brother Wang.

478
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:44,320
Yes..I really love him.

479
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:52,170
But don't misunderstand....
I'll never oppose you

480
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:55,640
Please accept me as his concubine

481
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:08,380
Please…

482
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:23,460
Xiaowei, just get up.

483
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:28,870
Sister Peirong, I beg you..…

484
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:35,490
Xiao wei.

485
00:47:39,737 --> 00:47:41,637
There is only one Mrs Wang.

486
00:47:46,045 --> 00:47:48,535
You should be scared today.

487
00:47:54,619 --> 00:47:55,849
Xiaorou!

488
00:47:56,558 --> 00:47:57,028
Yes!

489
00:47:57,955 --> 00:47:59,855
Take Xiaowei back to her room.

490
00:48:01,556 --> 00:48:02,546
Miss Xiaowei.

491
00:48:08,669 --> 00:48:12,069
Stick with her! Even when
she's relieves herself!

492
00:48:31,923 --> 00:48:33,653
Please get some rest, Miss Xiaowei.

493
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:35,280
Okay.

494
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:39,749
I have some good dim sum,
do you want some?

495
00:49:40,148 --> 00:49:40,848
No, thanks.

496
00:49:42,049 --> 00:49:44,389
You might try to poison me!.

497
00:49:47,878 --> 00:49:50,368
Do you still suspect me?

498
00:49:50,824 --> 00:49:52,654
I never suspected you.

499
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:55,689
I am sure you do!

500
00:50:28,758 --> 00:50:30,278
General! General!

501
00:50:30,659 --> 00:50:32,649
The Demon has done it again!

502
00:50:35,254 --> 00:50:36,384
Brother Yong.

503
00:50:37,999 --> 00:50:40,729
The Demon has killed some more people during
the last couple of days.

504
00:50:40,731 --> 00:50:43,291
Our soldiers were placed every where, but...

505
00:50:44,105 --> 00:50:45,795
..we still can't catch him.

506
00:50:46,207 --> 00:50:48,867
You can't catch him... He is a demon!

507
00:50:49,304 --> 00:50:50,394
Demon?

508
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:56,640
Don't you mean Xiaowei's a demon?

509
00:50:56,884 --> 00:50:58,344
You've been watching her all day.

510
00:50:58,344 --> 00:51:00,214
Why are there still deaths outside?

511
00:51:01,718 --> 00:51:03,718
Who says there is only one demon?

512
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,016
Another one?

513
00:51:07,195 --> 00:51:10,785
Wang Sheng, what do you think?

514
00:51:13,087 --> 00:51:17,757
I think..
He should be a kung fu expert.

515
00:51:17,758 --> 00:51:19,918
Only you can seize him.

516
00:51:20,465 --> 00:51:22,455
I sincerely hope you stay.

517
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:28,859
Peirong, all the citizens here
will thank you!

518
00:51:30,977 --> 00:51:31,907
Please!

519
00:51:34,351 --> 00:51:35,901
Peirong.

520
00:51:37,184 --> 00:51:41,214
Your persuasive Brother Yong.

521
00:51:47,092 --> 00:51:47,852
I'm sorry.

522
00:51:48,326 --> 00:51:51,416
Don't say sorry. I don't want you 
to say sorry.

523
00:51:51,826 --> 00:51:53,156
You've done nothing wrong.

524
00:51:56,396 --> 00:51:59,226
I'm back only to see that you're happy.

525
00:51:59,229 --> 00:52:00,499
You look good, dont you?

526
00:52:01,961 --> 00:52:03,121
Brother Yong.

527
00:52:04,303 --> 00:52:06,233
You're the best man ever.

528
00:52:06,443 --> 00:52:09,433
Hope you will find a woman better than me.

529
00:52:10,019 --> 00:52:11,779
Don't worry.

530
00:52:11,769 --> 00:52:14,039
I've been traveling around
alone very well.

531
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:16,377
So free and nothing to be anxious about.

532
00:52:16,377 --> 00:52:19,517
Lets talk later. I'll go and help 
Wang Sheng now.

533
00:52:21,752 --> 00:52:23,012
Stupid man!

534
00:52:26,486 --> 00:52:31,426
Miss Xiao Bing. He's a good man.

535
00:52:31,862 --> 00:52:33,522
Do treat him better!

536
00:52:37,377 --> 00:52:41,397
Don't lump me with him. 
It's not what you think.

537
00:52:41,796 --> 00:52:45,426
I'm not interested in such stupid stuff...

538
00:52:47,335 --> 00:52:54,805
put on our golden armour
and we are forever the strongest

539
00:52:55,418 --> 00:53:02,758
Sacrifice our lives for the sake 
of our parents

540
00:53:02,758 --> 00:53:06,818
Spill our blood…

541
00:53:17,312 --> 00:53:18,302
Xiahou Xiang!

542
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:24,580
This time, I get the plot…

543
00:53:35,517 --> 00:53:37,217
Mistress…

544
00:53:37,217 --> 00:53:40,457
My God! I heard that Pang Yong 
killed Xiahou Xiang!

545
00:53:40,452 --> 00:53:41,322
Impossible!

546
00:53:41,321 --> 00:53:43,221
The Mo Zhui guys say they saw it!

547
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:49,588
Xiahou Xiang is dead.

548
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:54,160
I know.

549
00:53:55,875 --> 00:53:57,535
They suspect that I killed him.

550
00:53:59,476 --> 00:54:00,406
I know that as well.

551
00:54:03,479 --> 00:54:04,459
I don't believe it though

552
00:54:06,904 --> 00:54:08,464
Under such circumstances...

553
00:54:09,976 --> 00:54:11,536
you will suffer if you follow me.

554
00:54:13,589 --> 00:54:15,519
Who's following you?

555
00:54:16,913 --> 00:54:18,973
Now you're following me 
to catch the demon!

556
00:54:20,627 --> 00:54:24,077
Catch it? Are you confident?

557
00:54:26,569 --> 00:54:28,289
No, for sure!

558
00:54:30,296 --> 00:54:32,456
When have I ever been confident?

559
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,550
But why are you still after him?

560
00:54:36,201 --> 00:54:37,171
You're not scared of death?

561
00:54:44,069 --> 00:54:45,559
I'm a Demon Hunter

562
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:48,540
It's my duty.

563
00:54:55,350 --> 00:54:59,410
His horse is still here,
He must still be in the city.

564
00:54:59,416 --> 00:55:00,616
You take a team there.

565
00:55:00,613 --> 00:55:01,853
Yes, Let's go!

566
00:55:01,846 --> 00:55:03,546
Go, take care general.

567
00:55:12,573 --> 00:55:13,403
Get some sleep

568
00:55:14,046 --> 00:55:17,016
I'll go no where tonight. 
I'll stay with you

569
00:55:32,515 --> 00:55:33,415
Don't worry!

570
00:55:34,618 --> 00:55:38,348
I don't believe Brother Yong
killed Xiahou Xiang either.

571
00:55:38,622 --> 00:55:42,352
I'll find him and ask him though.

572
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,530
I want to ask you.

573
00:56:01,938 --> 00:56:03,908
will you love her...

574
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:08,420
if Xiaowei is not a demon?

575
00:56:11,481 --> 00:56:14,111
How can Xiaowei be a demon?

576
00:56:29,938 --> 00:56:34,128
Okay ... I promise.

577
00:56:34,508 --> 00:56:39,068
I'll get more Taoist priests
to check her out, okay?

578
00:56:39,507 --> 00:56:40,497
Okay?

579
00:56:43,624 --> 00:56:45,284
You haven't answered me yet.

580
00:56:53,293 --> 00:56:55,593
Will you love her?

581
00:57:07,041 --> 00:57:09,511
Whether she is a demon or woman,

582
00:57:11,107 --> 00:57:13,097
I won't!

583
00:57:15,501 --> 00:57:16,401
Rest assured!

584
00:59:27,129 --> 00:59:28,089
What's up?

585
00:59:31,297 --> 00:59:32,587
Brother Wang!

586
00:59:35,464 --> 00:59:37,364
I think I must go.

587
00:59:39,631 --> 00:59:42,261
I've said too much....

588
00:59:44,541 --> 00:59:45,481
Did you forget?

589
00:59:46,178 --> 00:59:50,308
I promised to protect you.

590
00:59:50,307 --> 00:59:51,747
Peirong knows this ,too.

591
00:59:56,111 --> 01:00:00,551
If I die or live, that 's not important!

592
01:00:01,324 --> 01:00:02,214
How could it be?

593
01:00:05,227 --> 01:00:07,527
Cao Huong, Kinh Binh, Kinh An, brothers.

594
01:00:07,518 --> 01:00:09,648
They all like you.

595
01:00:10,464 --> 01:00:12,594
I think that nobody ever dislikes you…

596
01:00:13,926 --> 01:00:16,156
in the whole world?

597
01:00:17,401 --> 01:00:20,461
But I only want you to love me!

598
01:00:27,876 --> 01:00:31,536
Can I not even become your mistress?

599
01:00:39,723 --> 01:00:41,753
It's me who is qualified!

600
01:00:43,387 --> 01:00:46,787
Don't sell yourself short! 
You couldn't be my mistress.

601
01:00:47,428 --> 01:00:48,588
You should find a good man..

602
01:00:49,254 --> 01:00:53,524
who will take care of you and love you.

603
01:00:53,522 --> 01:00:54,492
Right?

604
01:01:03,342 --> 01:01:05,632
Have you ever loved me?

605
01:01:29,529 --> 01:01:31,929
I don't need anyone else!

606
01:01:32,437 --> 01:01:34,907
I don't have any preference

607
01:01:36,302 --> 01:01:38,962
I just want to be your woman.

608
01:01:40,608 --> 01:01:42,268
Even if just once…

609
01:03:08,574 --> 01:03:09,774
Are you alright?

610
01:03:27,597 --> 01:03:28,567
Alright.

611
01:03:29,536 --> 01:03:32,556
You needn't worry if Xiaowei's a demon, okay?

612
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:33,470
What's wrong?

613
01:03:34,736 --> 01:03:36,536
Why were you staying in her room?

614
01:03:42,441 --> 01:03:43,961
I…

615
01:03:43,964 --> 01:03:45,674
I just…
Don't need to say it

616
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:50,438
I know she really loves you.

617
01:03:53,923 --> 01:03:55,353
And I understand.

618
01:03:55,723 --> 01:03:57,453
It's not what you think…

619
01:03:57,864 --> 01:03:58,914
It's all my fault.

620
01:04:01,527 --> 01:04:04,687
As a wife , I was jealous maybe...

621
01:04:06,626 --> 01:04:08,496
If you love her too,!

622
01:04:10,466 --> 01:04:12,526
then make her your mistress.

623
01:04:12,531 --> 01:04:13,761
I don't.

624
01:04:24,454 --> 01:04:27,544
Let me finish my words.

625
01:04:36,691 --> 01:04:39,461
As her elder sister, I'll decide for her.

626
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:47,597
It's you…

627
01:04:49,470 --> 01:04:52,140
who still doesn't believe I can do it.

628
01:04:57,616 --> 01:04:58,576
General…

629
01:05:13,592 --> 01:05:14,922
Who let you out?

630
01:05:17,495 --> 01:05:18,985
Don't forget you're a demon!

631
01:05:19,459 --> 01:05:21,549
Don't shed a tear for a man!

632
01:05:22,002 --> 01:05:24,562
Now you're more stupid than that 
stupid woman!

633
01:05:25,427 --> 01:05:27,527
You know I love him?

634
01:05:27,806 --> 01:05:33,506
Do you know what love is,
you fly eater?

635
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:35,570
I know.

636
01:05:37,110 --> 01:05:40,910
And I've told you, I love you.

637
01:05:40,913 --> 01:05:42,813
But I don't love you!.

638
01:05:44,085 --> 01:05:48,175
I said that long ago. You've been 
shameless enough to stay!

639
01:05:52,432 --> 01:05:56,092
Who will get you all those hearts 
without me?.

640
01:05:56,524 --> 01:05:58,724
I'll live well without you!.

641
01:05:58,727 --> 01:06:01,927
Now act like a man and leave.

642
01:06:02,567 --> 01:06:03,537
Get away!

643
01:06:13,810 --> 01:06:15,140
Okay.

644
01:06:17,146 --> 01:06:18,806
I'm sorry for what I 've done.

645
01:06:20,886 --> 01:06:23,516
I'll never disturb you!.

646
01:06:25,582 --> 01:06:26,952
Go!

647
01:07:10,956 --> 01:07:12,486
Mistress...

648
01:07:29,010 --> 01:07:31,000
Sister Peirong, you're still up?

649
01:07:31,314 --> 01:07:32,574
Sister Xiaowei.

650
01:07:32,951 --> 01:07:37,581
I think there is one thing
I must talk to you about.

651
01:07:57,337 --> 01:07:59,777
You want me ...for some thing?

652
01:08:17,355 --> 01:08:19,155
Now you know it all.

653
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:29,330
Go tell everyone.
Those who know must die, after all.

654
01:08:41,201 --> 01:08:43,191
Brother Gao, Let's take a look outside.

655
01:08:43,190 --> 01:08:43,960
Be careful.

656
01:08:43,970 --> 01:08:44,940
Okay.
Go.

657
01:08:46,803 --> 01:08:48,933
Mistress, are you all right?

658
01:08:49,145 --> 01:08:49,805
I'm fine.

659
01:09:00,627 --> 01:09:01,747
What do you want?

660
01:09:10,762 --> 01:09:12,252
I havent decided yet

661
01:09:14,199 --> 01:09:15,259
Brother Gao.

662
01:09:16,301 --> 01:09:17,131
Miss Xiaowei.

663
01:09:17,132 --> 01:09:18,362
Don't come in!.

664
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:23,336
Brother Gao, Sister Peirong 
said she saw a demon.

665
01:09:23,339 --> 01:09:26,339
Demon? Where is it?

666
01:09:27,809 --> 01:09:30,209
Right here.

667
01:09:31,384 --> 01:09:33,254
No!

668
01:09:39,291 --> 01:09:43,851
Didn't you say you like me?,
Can you give me your heart?

669
01:09:58,037 --> 01:10:02,307
Seen any demons eating a human heart?

670
01:10:13,284 --> 01:10:18,414
Brother Sheng loves you. Don't hurt him!

671
01:10:21,996 --> 01:10:26,456
It's useless as long as you,
Mrs Wang is here.

672
01:10:27,435 --> 01:10:28,405
That's nothing.

673
01:10:31,174 --> 01:10:33,194
I can let you be Mrs.Wang.

674
01:10:33,188 --> 01:10:34,698
Me?

675
01:10:36,701 --> 01:10:40,301
Can you guarantee that you'll 
never come back?

676
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:46,697
I've seen you eat a human heart
Can I still stay alive?

677
01:10:51,746 --> 01:10:53,346
Go ahead kill me!.

678
01:10:59,426 --> 01:11:01,446
You think that I'm stupid?

679
01:11:02,926 --> 01:11:05,226
If I kill you,

680
01:11:05,230 --> 01:11:10,030
Brother Wang would miss you forever.

681
01:11:31,052 --> 01:11:33,022
Drink this!

682
01:11:33,859 --> 01:11:38,319
Go ahead, admit to being a demon 
and killing all those people.

683
01:11:41,439 --> 01:11:44,499
I'll be Mrs.Wang, and you'll be a demon!

684
01:11:54,847 --> 01:11:57,107
I can.

685
01:11:57,906 --> 01:12:00,336
But will you promise not to kill again?.

686
01:12:01,482 --> 01:12:06,922
I'm a demon. How can I grow If I don't?.

687
01:12:18,302 --> 01:12:21,232
Okay, I promise you.

688
01:12:21,223 --> 01:12:23,313
When I become Mrs. Wang.

689
01:12:23,804 --> 01:12:28,104
I'll stay with him, grow old and die with him.

690
01:12:39,541 --> 01:12:41,531
You really love him?

691
01:12:41,530 --> 01:12:44,170
Yes, I do.

692
01:13:08,297 --> 01:13:10,567
Do keep your word.

693
01:13:10,575 --> 01:13:15,445
If you have regrets I'll kill everyone.

694
01:13:18,444 --> 01:13:22,844
You don't even know
what love is.

695
01:13:37,896 --> 01:13:40,986
A demon...

696
01:13:41,295 --> 01:13:43,495
Xiaorou... Xiaorou...

697
01:13:43,498 --> 01:13:44,558
Help, help..

698
01:13:50,611 --> 01:13:52,041
Mistress...

699
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:53,600
What's happening?

700
01:14:05,178 --> 01:14:08,148
Hey,stop!

701
01:14:38,478 --> 01:14:39,638
Mistress, is it you?

702
01:14:40,153 --> 01:14:43,953
I'm a demon.
Go ahead kill me.

703
01:14:50,426 --> 01:14:52,116
You all stop moving.

704
01:14:52,428 --> 01:14:53,188
Back off.

705
01:14:53,523 --> 01:14:54,923
Or I'll kill you.

706
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:15,380
Peirong, stand it! You'll be fine

707
01:15:23,689 --> 01:15:26,659
Master! Mistress is really the demon!.

708
01:15:26,648 --> 01:15:28,088
Xiaorou, dont talk nonsense.

709
01:15:29,669 --> 01:15:33,569
Hassiter Peirong... suffered a 
																strange disease??

710
01:15:34,202 --> 01:15:36,032
Not her? So who killed Brother Gao?

711
01:15:36,027 --> 01:15:36,647
Sure.

712
01:15:37,135 --> 01:15:38,435
We must avenge Brother Gao!.

713
01:15:51,450 --> 01:15:53,310
She seems to have suffered from an evil poison.

714
01:15:55,126 --> 01:15:58,056
It's graded by color.

715
01:15:58,047 --> 01:16:00,947
The lighter the color, the more deadly it is

716
01:16:01,358 --> 01:16:06,488
White is therefore the most poisonous of all.

717
01:16:06,495 --> 01:16:10,765
When the whole body turns white, one will die.

718
01:16:11,430 --> 01:16:15,030
Do you have any ways?
How can we save her?

719
01:16:23,982 --> 01:16:26,542
You've woken up, Peirong. Feeling better?

720
01:16:27,042 --> 01:16:28,972
You all leave me!

721
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:31,440
Did Xiaowei do this?

722
01:16:33,551 --> 01:16:35,111
I myself.

723
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:38,490
am the demon.

724
01:16:38,486 --> 01:16:39,456
Don't speak nonsense!

725
01:16:40,588 --> 01:16:42,318
Don't worry. You'll be fine.

726
01:16:42,754 --> 01:16:45,984
She is a demon hunter,
she must be able to help.

727
01:16:45,990 --> 01:16:47,730
Don't you have your family's treasures?

728
01:16:48,231 --> 01:16:53,251
Sure. My grandfather left me a lot..

729
01:16:54,299 --> 01:16:56,129
Not these!

730
01:16:56,678 --> 01:16:58,798
Your grandfather...
he gave me that one treasure

731
01:16:59,008 --> 01:17:00,338
Sure…

732
01:17:02,445 --> 01:17:04,315
Look! She really has the treasure!

733
01:17:04,308 --> 01:17:05,328
It can destroy the demons.

734
01:17:06,008 --> 01:17:07,168
come to think of it.

735
01:17:07,166 --> 01:17:09,336
my grandfather told me..
once the demon is killed...

736
01:17:09,344 --> 01:17:12,444
the dark magic cast on the human body 
should vanish

737
01:17:12,441 --> 01:17:13,471
Can you hear it?

738
01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:14,550
Yes.

739
01:17:15,085 --> 01:17:19,075
You'd have used it if it was really useful

740
01:17:22,828 --> 01:17:24,728
You cannot beat her

741
01:17:26,164 --> 01:17:27,224
Don't worry.

742
01:17:28,367 --> 01:17:33,387
The killings should end with me

743
01:17:36,463 --> 01:17:41,163
Stop speaking nonsense. 
I will have the way

744
01:17:55,587 --> 01:17:56,527
Peirong.

745
01:17:56,858 --> 01:17:57,618
Peirong.

746
01:18:00,295 --> 01:18:02,315
Peirong. I've taken back my sword.

747
01:18:02,688 --> 01:18:04,348
You know how powerful it is?

748
01:18:04,689 --> 01:18:07,129
With it...I have never lost!

749
01:18:07,132 --> 01:18:08,752
You'll be safe once I kill the demon!

750
01:18:09,499 --> 01:18:11,289
I'll chop her into pieces! Okay?

751
01:18:26,885 --> 01:18:28,285
I'll ask you one more time.

752
01:18:29,655 --> 01:18:32,415
You're sure it's Xiaowei?
I don't want any innocent deaths

753
01:18:34,364 --> 01:18:36,224
You still don't believe me now?

754
01:18:36,215 --> 01:18:37,085
Okay, I'm going.

755
01:18:37,486 --> 01:18:38,416
You take care of Peirong.

756
01:18:40,394 --> 01:18:41,424
You're really going?

757
01:18:41,414 --> 01:18:42,284
I must go for sure.

758
01:18:42,598 --> 01:18:44,528
You can't... You can't kill her!

759
01:18:45,103 --> 01:18:48,143
Don't kid me!
Your Grandfather cut off the fox spirit's tail.

760
01:18:48,137 --> 01:18:50,657
This sword's great
How could I not kill him?

761
01:18:51,511 --> 01:18:53,771
My granpa cut her using his own blood!

762
01:18:56,736 --> 01:18:59,576
We, the "Demon Hunters" have blood

763
01:18:59,871 --> 01:19:02,171
which can especially kill demons.

764
01:19:03,145 --> 01:19:05,205
If you do want to kill Xiaowei.

765
01:19:06,279 --> 01:19:07,899
take me there.

766
01:19:45,774 --> 01:19:46,574
Wang Sheng.

767
01:19:47,184 --> 01:19:49,214
do you know what's happening?

768
01:20:09,972 --> 01:20:12,532
Miss, don't go theré!

769
01:20:17,841 --> 01:20:19,331
Are you really a demon?

770
01:20:34,762 --> 01:20:35,552
Yes.

771
01:20:41,862 --> 01:20:43,452
You killed Gao Xiang?

772
01:20:57,247 --> 01:20:59,547
I killed all.

773
01:20:59,539 --> 01:21:00,809
We must have revenge for Brother Gao.

774
01:21:00,810 --> 01:21:02,680
You want to kill her, kill me first

775
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:04,636
Revenge for Brother Gao!.

776
01:21:05,645 --> 01:21:06,305
An eye for an eye!

777
01:21:06,791 --> 01:21:10,761
Revenge for Brother Gao.

778
01:21:10,756 --> 01:21:12,556
Shut up!

779
01:21:13,665 --> 01:21:15,635
She's a demon!
I must kill her!

780
01:21:26,708 --> 01:21:33,408
But how can I give her up as a husband?

781
01:21:38,517 --> 01:21:39,537
Put down the knife!

782
01:21:41,715 --> 01:21:42,275
Wang Sheng.

783
01:21:43,553 --> 01:21:44,283
Put down the knife first.

784
01:21:44,661 --> 01:21:45,391
Peirong...

785
01:21:45,756 --> 01:21:50,626
I must take all the responsibility with you!.

786
01:21:50,994 --> 01:21:56,454
I'm a demon. I killed so many and deserve it.

787
01:21:57,591 --> 01:21:58,891
You're my wife.

788
01:22:01,368 --> 01:22:08,268
Whether you're a demon or a woman, I love you.

789
01:22:09,073 --> 01:22:10,703
I love you forever.

790
01:22:14,915 --> 01:22:15,945
No!

791
01:22:28,726 --> 01:22:30,016
Promise me.

792
01:22:31,294 --> 01:22:33,454
Live well.

793
01:22:35,071 --> 01:22:36,971
Live on for me...

794
01:22:59,521 --> 01:23:01,011
Evil woman!

795
01:23:08,699 --> 01:23:13,069
You all see it? She is the real demon!

796
01:23:13,735 --> 01:23:17,395
You all see it now? She is the real demon!

797
01:23:40,892 --> 01:23:41,652
What, leave me!

798
01:23:42,717 --> 01:23:43,877
You can't kill her.

799
01:23:45,134 --> 01:23:45,854
What are you doing?

800
01:23:46,834 --> 01:23:47,594
Go.

801
01:25:11,904 --> 01:25:12,774
Give her back to me.

802
01:25:18,136 --> 01:25:19,966
If you love me.

803
01:25:21,246 --> 01:25:23,476
Give Peirong back to me!

804
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:27,240
If you love her so much...

805
01:25:28,850 --> 01:25:31,650
why don't you die with her?

806
01:25:32,011 --> 01:25:33,571
I'll die.

807
01:25:37,122 --> 01:25:38,712
Get her here

808
01:25:41,491 --> 01:25:42,961
Will you believe her?

809
01:25:43,467 --> 01:25:44,897
If Peirong dies.

810
01:25:46,262 --> 01:25:48,022
I'll die with her

811
01:25:51,135 --> 01:25:53,165
If she comes back to life.

812
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:58,070
Tell her that

813
01:26:00,917 --> 01:26:02,747
I haven't been a good husband.

814
01:26:03,838 --> 01:26:06,108
I've failed to protect her.

815
01:26:10,120 --> 01:26:12,140
I love you.

816
01:26:15,685 --> 01:26:18,115
but I'm married to Peirong.

817
01:26:19,726 --> 01:26:20,986
No.

818
01:26:21,665 --> 01:26:24,265
Brother Sheng...

819
01:27:02,696 --> 01:27:04,226
What is this?

820
01:27:04,219 --> 01:27:06,859
You saved them with a thousand
year old Spirit.

821
01:27:07,266 --> 01:27:10,136
You're a demon

822
01:27:16,142 --> 01:27:17,542
They won't let you go, even if you save them!
How can a demon get true love in this world?

823
01:27:17,942 --> 01:27:19,532
I'll get you out of here, once I kill them all

824
01:28:36,844 --> 01:28:39,744
Look! He has a shadow!

825
01:30:07,718 --> 01:30:08,688
Take it!

826
01:30:38,387 --> 01:30:39,317
Hurry up!.

827
01:30:47,301 --> 01:30:49,061
Kill him...

828
01:30:49,051 --> 01:30:51,851
Do it just do it. It doesn't matter if I die
You must kill him!

829
01:30:52,337 --> 01:30:54,857
Take Peirong's spirit back an save her.

830
01:30:55,333 --> 01:30:57,523
Kill me! Do it quickly!

831
01:30:58,103 --> 01:30:59,223
Do it!

832
01:31:21,986 --> 01:31:23,546
Xiaowei...

833
01:32:54,145 --> 01:32:56,235
Much hatred in the world...

834
01:32:56,222 --> 01:33:02,502
..can be ceased without killing.

835
01:33:03,650 --> 01:33:05,340
I now realize why.

836
01:33:07,578 --> 01:33:11,608
I couldn't exert all my energy as a Demon Hunter.

837
01:33:14,591 --> 01:33:17,361
It's because I've been bearing hatred.

838
01:33:24,562 --> 01:33:26,052
Go ahead, save them.

839
01:35:37,550 --> 01:35:39,640
General, General…

840
01:35:42,485 --> 01:35:43,505
Are you okay general?

841
01:35:45,053 --> 01:35:46,513
Master are you okay?

842
01:35:47,521 --> 01:35:49,221
Brother Dabao are you okay?
Mistress.

843
01:35:49,221 --> 01:35:50,491
General are you okay?
Brother Dabao…

844
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:51,640
Mistress, it's fine now.

845
01:36:11,467 --> 01:36:13,097
Brother Yong …

846
01:36:14,149 --> 01:36:15,209
Brother Yong

847
01:36:15,546 --> 01:36:17,016
Brother Yong ... Brother Yong…

848
01:36:17,007 --> 01:36:19,007
What's wrong with you? Brother Yong!

849
01:36:19,008 --> 01:36:20,568
Wake up... Brother Yong

850
01:36:20,570 --> 01:36:22,270
Brother Yong ! Wake up...

851
01:36:22,269 --> 01:36:23,479
Brother Yong ! Wake up...

852
01:36:24,284 --> 01:36:27,384
Brother Yong !…

853
01:36:27,381 --> 01:36:31,321
Don't shake me anymore
I'm surely dying!

854
01:36:31,321 --> 01:36:32,761
I'm so tired after a long fight.

855
01:36:55,544 --> 01:36:56,474
You're sure you don't want to stay?

856
01:37:01,185 --> 01:37:02,645
There's still many places I want to go.

857
01:37:05,453 --> 01:37:06,683
Me too.

858
01:37:17,464 --> 01:37:18,394
I'm leaving.

859
01:38:00,572 --> 01:38:01,502
Take care.

860
01:38:09,649 --> 01:38:10,839
Where are you going?

861
01:38:12,482 --> 01:38:15,112
The world's so big, I can go wherever I want.

862
01:38:15,113 --> 01:38:16,583
You seem to have a gift for
catching demons!

863
01:38:17,153 --> 01:38:17,813
Hey!

864
01:38:19,192 --> 01:38:20,882
Do you want to catch demons with me?

865
01:38:50,743 --> 01:38:52,273
Why don't you call me master?

866
01:38:52,656 --> 01:38:55,646
You're not qualified with all those mediocre skills?

867
01:38:56,647 --> 01:38:58,307
I'm more experienced than you!

868
01:39:00,789 --> 01:39:02,149
What are you looking at?

869
01:39:03,395 --> 01:39:06,155
Take off your cap and
you look very much like a woman!

870
01:39:08,230 --> 01:39:18,700
