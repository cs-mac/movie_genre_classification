1
00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:15,166
MY LIFE:

2
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:22,833
Life, for most people,

3
00:02:23,292 --> 00:02:26,249
is going from point A to point B.

4
00:02:26,417 --> 00:02:28,374
But not for me.

5
00:02:28,542 --> 00:02:30,083
I've got a point B problem.

6
00:02:30,834 --> 00:02:32,374
Mia, I have your dress.

7
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:34,208
Give that to her.

8
00:02:34,917 --> 00:02:36,124
Hurry up!

9
00:02:37,084 --> 00:02:40,666
Yet I'd love to have
a throughline to my life -

10
00:02:41,084 --> 00:02:41,874
a point B.

11
00:02:42,042 --> 00:02:43,708
Tom!

12
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,333
For most people,
those small, daily trips

13
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,458
add up and, little by little,
lead to one goal -

14
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:53,499
a unique, ultimate goal.

15
00:02:54,292 --> 00:02:56,541
Like the light
at the end of the tunnel.

16
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:58,749
It's all wonderfully linear.

17
00:02:58,917 --> 00:02:59,916
Over there!

18
00:03:00,417 --> 00:03:02,083
But not for me.

19
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,833
I always keep changing direction.

20
00:03:12,542 --> 00:03:14,499
Why is my life like this?

21
00:03:14,667 --> 00:03:16,749
Why is it such a fucking mess?

22
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:14,249
CHINESE PUZZLE

23
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,624
Ni Hao!

24
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:51,166
My life may not go
from point A to point B,

25
00:05:51,334 --> 00:05:54,166
but a novel has to go
from point A to point B.

26
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:57,124
Hold on, let me tell this in order.

27
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,916
I'm writing a novel...

28
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,374
I'm trying.

29
00:06:01,542 --> 00:06:03,916
This guy's my editor.
He's helping me focus.

30
00:06:05,084 --> 00:06:06,999
- You in Paris?
- No, New York.

31
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:09,583
He's helping me get to point B.

32
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,458
- That's New York?
- Yeah.

33
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,999
- Really?
- I've been here 2 months.

34
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:15,624
D'you get my title proposal?

35
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,749
Yeah. Why "Chinese Puzzle"?

36
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:20,708
Well, I'm taking stock.

37
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,666
I used to think
my life wasn't simple.

38
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:26,749
But here in New York,
I see that my old life

39
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:27,874
was really simple.

40
00:06:28,542 --> 00:06:30,708
So, there! "Chinese Puzzle."

41
00:06:31,084 --> 00:06:32,458
Look at me!

42
00:06:34,292 --> 00:06:36,749
So that is...

43
00:06:36,917 --> 00:06:38,874
Well, that was my life a year ago.

44
00:06:39,042 --> 00:06:42,541
Okay, everybody look at me.
That's great! Smile!

45
00:06:43,042 --> 00:06:43,958
Tomato!

46
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,374
Get closer.

47
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,333
Smile! No, a real smile.

48
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,749
Tomato!

49
00:06:50,417 --> 00:06:52,999
You're seeing
our last idyllic moments.

50
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:59,208
I can't stand writing stuff I hate
anymore.

51
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,083
Well, you can handle it.
I can't anymore!

52
00:07:08,792 --> 00:07:10,333
Did I say that?
Did I say that?!

53
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,916
Stop screaming!

54
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:16,874
I never said that.

55
00:07:17,042 --> 00:07:18,833
It's weird to think that

56
00:07:19,334 --> 00:07:21,624
for 10 years
we had been so happy.

57
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:29,916
It's really horrible.

58
00:07:30,084 --> 00:07:32,249
To think that that. That there

59
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:34,999
that can disappear.

60
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,208
You gotta watch out with happiness.

61
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,458
Happiness is disaster for fiction.

62
00:07:41,834 --> 00:07:44,749
Drama's what sucks us in.
Life is drama.

63
00:07:44,917 --> 00:07:47,374
But you wanna be happy in life,
don't you?

64
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:48,666
Sure, in life.

65
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,166
But I'm talking about stories.

66
00:07:51,334 --> 00:07:52,416
What?

67
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,374
You see? That's a bore.

68
00:07:58,834 --> 00:08:01,958
Problem over!
Wendy and I broke up 6 months ago.

69
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:03,458
I don't believe it!

70
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:04,958
It's true.

71
00:08:05,125 --> 00:08:05,916
Oh, no, Xavier!

72
00:08:06,584 --> 00:08:09,208
Don't make the same mistake
Dad and I did.

73
00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:10,916
This is horrible!

74
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:11,916
But why?

75
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:13,958
You made such a great couple.

76
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:15,708
Everyone reacted like my mother.

77
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,874
I know it's horrible.
I know it's dumb.

78
00:08:19,042 --> 00:08:21,124
But no.
And yet, I tried everything.

79
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:22,874
What about the kids?

80
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:24,749
Nothing could be done.

81
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:26,416
I don't know yet.

82
00:08:26,584 --> 00:08:27,916
You'll still see them, I hope.

83
00:08:28,084 --> 00:08:30,374
- Yeah.
- Don't be like your father.

84
00:08:33,792 --> 00:08:35,874
Isn't there... I don't know,

85
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:40,208
some effort that will lead you
back onto the path of love?

86
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:42,541
It's not a question of effort.

87
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,999
That's how it is.

88
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,041
That's life.

89
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:47,458
You love each other...

90
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,958
then you don't
love each other anymore.

91
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,749
You change!

92
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,458
Was it Wendy's idea?

93
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,916
Yes, but I didn't do much
to hold her back.

94
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:03,624
She went on about
how I never wanted to marry her.

95
00:09:03,792 --> 00:09:05,874
Then, this was my fault...

96
00:09:06,459 --> 00:09:09,499
I screwed up.
I really screwed up big time.

97
00:09:09,834 --> 00:09:11,041
How so?

98
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:13,291
- Remember Isabelle?
- The lesbian?

99
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:15,708
The Belgian girl
I met in Barcelona.

100
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:18,958
How can I sum this up?

101
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,999
Isabelle's like a buddy to me.
Isabelle's my buddy.

102
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:29,208
She's crazy about my kids
and wanted some herself.

103
00:09:30,042 --> 00:09:33,708
She and a girlfriend almost did it
but then they split.

104
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:37,958
Then she fell in love with
an American - a Chinese-American.

105
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:40,958
The love of her life.
Since they hooked up,

106
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:44,958
all they wanted was
to have a baby and move to NYC.

107
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,958
But my buddy was up shit creek.

108
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:50,416
She cried about it every day.

109
00:09:50,584 --> 00:09:54,333
And when your best buddy's
dying to be a mommy...

110
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,166
It's hard to handle.

111
00:10:09,834 --> 00:10:11,291
Tell me honestly,

112
00:10:11,834 --> 00:10:13,124
would...

113
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,958
Would it piss you off
if I help Isabelle have a baby?

114
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:29,749
I wish I had a picture of Wendy
at that moment.

115
00:10:30,334 --> 00:10:32,916
Just so you could see
the look she gave me.

116
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,833
Put yourself in her shoes.
It is kind of hard to swallow.

117
00:10:39,042 --> 00:10:42,958
Even if we don't fuck and
I don't cheat on her technically,

118
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,208
she can't accept it.

119
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,166
Did you tell her
we're moving to New York,

120
00:10:48,334 --> 00:10:50,249
that I got a job on Wall Street?

121
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:51,958
You'll never even hear
about the kid.

122
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,583
I know.

123
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,791
I'll be with my chick.

124
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,374
You won't be a father in
the traditional sense of the term!

125
00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:05,833
I remember her words exactly,

126
00:11:06,334 --> 00:11:09,166
"You won't be a father in
the traditional sense of the term."

127
00:11:18,709 --> 00:11:22,583
The rest happened in a clinic.
The least sexy place on earth.

128
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,458
I hadn't bought a porn magazine
since I was 19.

129
00:11:26,084 --> 00:11:28,374
Getting back into that
seemed absurd.

130
00:11:38,542 --> 00:11:39,708
And then...

131
00:11:40,792 --> 00:11:44,708
I don't think it ever took me
so long to ejaculate in my life.

132
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,833
Are you crazy?
What are you doing?

133
00:12:01,084 --> 00:12:05,083
Get back here!
It's dangerous to leave the dorm.

134
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:34,708
Shit!

135
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,374
- All done?
- Yeah.

136
00:13:31,542 --> 00:13:33,083
See you in 20 minutes.

137
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:39,249
D'you shoot your wad?

138
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,791
Now it's your turn.

139
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,999
Xavier,

140
00:14:01,917 --> 00:14:04,708
I don't know if this will work
but...

141
00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:08,708
What you just did,
I'll never forget.

142
00:14:09,459 --> 00:14:10,499
Never.

143
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:16,416
I was happy to help you.

144
00:14:19,042 --> 00:14:21,499
I don't think I could have said no.

145
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:29,916
You're like my chick.

146
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,583
That's great! Hold onto that.

147
00:14:32,792 --> 00:14:33,499
The baby?

148
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:35,041
No, "You're like my chick."

149
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:37,083
I don't know.
I'm kind of ashamed.

150
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:40,374
Who gives a shit about shame?
Pounce!

151
00:14:40,542 --> 00:14:43,041
Shame's great! Shame's insane!

152
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:45,041
It's a thousand times better
than happiness!

153
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:46,833
So then what?

154
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,708
Wendy went to New York for
a few weeks to work on a script.

155
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:54,291
And then, when she got back...

156
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,291
What?

157
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,958
Then we schlepped back and forth
between apartments.

158
00:15:39,542 --> 00:15:41,374
- Let me open it!
- I'm opening the door!

159
00:15:41,542 --> 00:15:43,291
- No, let me!
- Let go!

160
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:47,083
Come on, kids!
Don't start fighting!

161
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,124
Not every time we go to Mom's.

162
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,749
The worst
wasn't Wendy's evasive look.

163
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,041
It was my son's insistent look.

164
00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:04,583
Bye, Daddy.

165
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:07,249
He could see that
Wendy and I were unhappy.

166
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,083
And...

167
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:13,416
I could see
that made him unhappy.

168
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,708
Bye, Mommy.

169
00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:22,249
Be right there, Mia.

170
00:16:22,417 --> 00:16:24,916
How do we deal with summer vacation?

171
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:26,999
Want me to take July or August?

172
00:16:44,084 --> 00:16:45,249
What?

173
00:16:46,417 --> 00:16:48,083
Are you crazy?

174
00:16:48,417 --> 00:16:49,916
Are you out of your mind?

175
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:51,666
New York?

176
00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:55,833
You can't take off with my kids!

177
00:16:59,042 --> 00:17:00,708
Are you shitting me?

178
00:17:18,334 --> 00:17:19,499
If you're honest,

179
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:23,124
you just have to face the fact
that you've ruined your life.

180
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:25,541
That's it!

181
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,791
I'm turning 40 and

182
00:17:28,292 --> 00:17:29,458
in fact...

183
00:17:30,042 --> 00:17:31,291
I've ruined my life.

184
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:34,333
Your only salvation
at times like this

185
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,333
when you've lost hope
and never believed in God -

186
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,541
are... German philosophers.

187
00:17:40,709 --> 00:17:43,291
For example, Schopenhauer said...

188
00:17:43,459 --> 00:17:45,124
Life is like embroidery.

189
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,208
You spend the first half of life
on the front side,

190
00:17:49,709 --> 00:17:52,124
the pretty side of the embroidery.

191
00:17:52,709 --> 00:17:56,708
But you spend the second half
on the other side.

192
00:17:58,917 --> 00:18:00,499
It's not as pretty but...

193
00:18:00,959 --> 00:18:03,458
you can see
how the threads are woven together.

194
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,541
You can see how it's made.

195
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,124
Fuck, that's true.

196
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:10,749
Thanks, Schopenhauer.

197
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,041
That helps.

198
00:18:16,459 --> 00:18:18,999
- How many of you are traveling?
- Three.

199
00:18:21,792 --> 00:18:23,124
Bon voyage!

200
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,041
I'll see you soon.

201
00:18:29,334 --> 00:18:30,624
Bye-bye.

202
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:33,999
Will you come see me
on your vacation?

203
00:18:34,334 --> 00:18:35,499
When is that?

204
00:18:35,667 --> 00:18:36,791
In just a few months.

205
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:40,166
Last call for Air France Flight 612

206
00:18:40,334 --> 00:18:41,708
to New York.

207
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,624
I think that's you.

208
00:18:49,584 --> 00:18:50,416
Shall we go?

209
00:18:50,584 --> 00:18:52,708
Can I talk to you?

210
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:53,958
What is it?

211
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,208
I don't wanna go live there.

212
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:01,208
New York's a great town.
It's gonna be great!

213
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,541
I don't wanna go.
I wanna stay here.

214
00:19:03,917 --> 00:19:05,624
You don't know New York.

215
00:19:05,792 --> 00:19:08,041
New York's a really beautiful city.

216
00:19:08,584 --> 00:19:12,166
They've got skyscrapers.
You're really lucky to be going!

217
00:19:12,459 --> 00:19:15,166
So are you glad we're leaving?

218
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,833
No. Of course I'm not glad.

219
00:19:26,334 --> 00:19:28,708
Then why do you keep saying
it's so great?

220
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:39,874
Xavier!

221
00:19:40,584 --> 00:19:42,999
- It's gonna be great.
- Okay.

222
00:19:55,042 --> 00:19:56,999
- Bye-bye, Daddy.
- Bye-bye, sweetheart.

223
00:20:01,209 --> 00:20:02,541
Don't be sad.

224
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,833
If Xavier were here,
I know what he'd say.

225
00:20:12,542 --> 00:20:14,374
"My first two novels
are being released."

226
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,458
"They're about me"

227
00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:17,833
"but mostly about you."

228
00:20:20,542 --> 00:20:23,374
What happened?
You really gave us a scare!

229
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:26,666
The place is packed.
Jean-Claude just started.

230
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:27,958
You must be thrilled!

231
00:20:28,584 --> 00:20:29,583
Hi, remember me?

232
00:20:30,042 --> 00:20:33,291
- Your neighbor from the olden days.
- Incredible.

233
00:20:33,459 --> 00:20:37,041
I wanted to say hi.
I just happened to be here.

234
00:20:37,209 --> 00:20:39,249
You must be over the moon!

235
00:20:39,417 --> 00:20:41,291
We'll talk later.

236
00:20:42,834 --> 00:20:45,374
Let me introduce Antoine Garceau.

237
00:20:45,917 --> 00:20:47,874
Watch out!
He's the next Proust!

238
00:20:48,042 --> 00:20:51,708
Congrats! Looks like you're a hit.

239
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:55,958
Here's my card, on the off chance

240
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,458
you wanna get in touch.

241
00:20:57,625 --> 00:20:58,999
Here he is now!

242
00:20:59,167 --> 00:21:02,124
Xavier Rousseau,
the man of the hour!

243
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:06,583
We were afraid you wouldn't show!

244
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:14,458
I'll turn the floor over to him.
I'm sure he has lots to say.

245
00:21:43,792 --> 00:21:47,958
Despite all that was happening
for me in Paris, I decided to leave.

246
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:03,958
Life! The unforeseen!

247
00:22:04,209 --> 00:22:06,624
All that stuff
you can't even imagine.

248
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:08,374
That's what I got hit with.

249
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:11,374
Yet again.
And frankly, I wasn't up to it.

250
00:22:11,542 --> 00:22:14,791
Yet again,
I was taking off on another journey.

251
00:22:58,959 --> 00:23:00,708
Sorry.
It was hard not to wake you.

252
00:23:02,292 --> 00:23:03,541
That's okay.

253
00:23:07,375 --> 00:23:09,999
So... Classy, huh?
Waking up in New York!

254
00:23:11,459 --> 00:23:12,583
Yeah.

255
00:23:14,709 --> 00:23:17,874
I'm so happy you're here!
Isn't it great?

256
00:23:18,959 --> 00:23:20,791
Just like old times!

257
00:23:21,542 --> 00:23:23,791
We'll live together.
It'll be great!

258
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,208
Isabelle, you know,

259
00:23:28,959 --> 00:23:30,291
times have changed.

260
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,249
We're turning 40...

261
00:23:32,584 --> 00:23:34,374
Stop acting like an old geezer!

262
00:23:34,542 --> 00:23:36,666
It's not about being old.
It's just that

263
00:23:36,834 --> 00:23:38,124
our lives have changed.

264
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:40,374
I'm gonna have my kids over.

265
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:45,458
And I'm not sure Ju's into living
with her chick's old pal.

266
00:23:46,334 --> 00:23:47,333
We know where that goes.

267
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,624
Ju doesn't give a shit.

268
00:23:53,834 --> 00:23:55,708
No, it's fine.

269
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,166
See.

270
00:24:00,584 --> 00:24:03,374
No, Ju does give a shit.
And she's right.

271
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:06,208
You're really sweet to take me in.

272
00:24:06,417 --> 00:24:08,416
But I'll try to find
an apartment soon.

273
00:24:08,709 --> 00:24:11,708
Think about my kids being here.
Plus yours.

274
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:14,958
It'll never work.
I need my own place.

275
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:19,166
I dunno...
It would make me happy.

276
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:24,083
Anyway, feel free to stay
as long as you like.

277
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:27,708
And Ju and I will help you
find a place.

278
00:24:54,584 --> 00:24:56,041
Is that far?

279
00:28:04,334 --> 00:28:06,208
Let me make a quick digression.

280
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:08,208
As a foreigner in the US,

281
00:28:08,375 --> 00:28:11,624
you inevitably confront
one excruciating thing.

282
00:28:12,417 --> 00:28:13,583
That!

283
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:15,613
If your English isn't impeccable,

284
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:18,791
you quickly begin to feel
like some sort of retard.

285
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:22,499
Everyone politely
lowers themselves to your level.

286
00:28:23,084 --> 00:28:24,833
Maybe I'm being paranoid,

287
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,499
but I got the sense
he wasn't really seeing at me.

288
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:31,541
To this New World man,
as a Frenchman,

289
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:33,291
I seemed to represent

290
00:28:33,834 --> 00:28:34,874
the Old World.

291
00:28:36,042 --> 00:28:38,499
I have journeyed one hundred leagues.

292
00:28:38,667 --> 00:28:40,333
And with nary a blush,

293
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,499
Nor on bended knee,
I proudly sit upright before you.

294
00:29:35,334 --> 00:29:36,749
Daddy!

295
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:41,958
How are you, my darlings?

296
00:29:42,959 --> 00:29:44,083
I'm so happy.

297
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,583
- When did you get here?
- Yesterday.

298
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,999
I really missed you.

299
00:29:48,167 --> 00:29:50,124
Did you enlist in the army or what?

300
00:29:50,292 --> 00:29:51,499
Why do you say that?

301
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:53,583
Look at you!

302
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,749
A uniform?

303
00:30:09,625 --> 00:30:10,708
Who says it's good?

304
00:30:15,292 --> 00:30:16,416
Stop right now!

305
00:30:16,584 --> 00:30:19,166
Over my dead body!
No uniforms for my kids!

306
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,249
Sorry but this is making me crazy.

307
00:30:57,459 --> 00:31:00,124
Calm down. It's not my fault.

308
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:03,124
But I understand.
I'd flip out, too.

309
00:31:30,084 --> 00:31:32,208
They probably couldn't
get into a public school.

310
00:31:32,375 --> 00:31:34,583
Wendy did that at the last minute.

311
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,874
And their neighborhood
must be murder.

312
00:31:37,709 --> 00:31:38,999
It's another culture.

313
00:31:39,167 --> 00:31:40,416
Another culture!

314
00:31:58,209 --> 00:31:59,749
Then she says...

315
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,624
Like I'm gonna go see her lawyer!

316
00:32:04,709 --> 00:32:06,666
Know how much
Wendy's guy charges?

317
00:32:06,834 --> 00:32:09,333
$200 an hour! Just to chitchat!

318
00:32:10,042 --> 00:32:13,249
He's even got a gadget
that clocks your phone calls.

319
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,583
I swear!
You know what that asshole said?

320
00:32:19,959 --> 00:32:22,333
What the hell does that mean?

321
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:25,333
Going to her lawyer was
a huge mistake.

322
00:32:25,875 --> 00:32:27,624
I'm looking for a cheaper one.

323
00:33:59,084 --> 00:34:00,291
Hi, there!

324
00:34:00,459 --> 00:34:02,999
- Martine, I just got your message.
- So?

325
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,874
I'm in New York.

326
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:06,624
- Are you shittin' me?
- No.

327
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,999
Oh, shit!

328
00:34:09,584 --> 00:34:12,374
I wanted us to celebrate my 40th,
like we did 10 years ago.

329
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:16,624
What's with you women?
You all wanna relive the past!

330
00:34:17,167 --> 00:34:19,208
Excuse me, Monsieur!

331
00:34:19,375 --> 00:34:21,166
Surrounded by sentimental women!

332
00:34:21,334 --> 00:34:23,833
I didn't mean
to disturb you and your harem...

333
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,333
Martine, calm down!

334
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:28,166
I'm as single as they come!

335
00:34:28,334 --> 00:34:32,333
Isabelle's putting me up.
She just wants to relive old times.

336
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:35,999
Still, we're making progress.

337
00:34:36,167 --> 00:34:37,083
Yeah.

338
00:34:37,292 --> 00:34:39,708
It used to take us days
to get over stuff.

339
00:34:39,875 --> 00:34:42,583
Both of us sulking
and never saying why.

340
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,083
That would've taken us a week.

341
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,541
We have made progress!

342
00:34:47,917 --> 00:34:50,083
Look who's here!

343
00:34:50,584 --> 00:34:53,249
Hey, Lucas! Whaddup, my man?

344
00:34:53,417 --> 00:34:57,374
Nobody says "whaddup" anymore.
You're such a noob!

345
00:34:58,750 --> 00:34:59,541
What's a "noob"?

346
00:34:59,834 --> 00:35:01,583
You're a dinosaur, Xavier!

347
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:02,624
For sure!

348
00:35:02,792 --> 00:35:04,958
Say hello to Xavier.
He's in New York.

349
00:35:05,125 --> 00:35:07,333
You shittin' me?
You're in New York?

350
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,374
You got all the luck!

351
00:35:11,334 --> 00:35:13,791
Xavier! Chow time!

352
00:35:13,959 --> 00:35:14,999
Coming!

353
00:37:26,542 --> 00:37:29,458
You guys are lucky!
It's so beautiful here.

354
00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:35,458
Now I get it. Rents are insane.
And all I've seen is shit.

355
00:37:37,834 --> 00:37:38,833
Xavier...

356
00:37:40,667 --> 00:37:43,124
Ju had an idea.

357
00:37:57,167 --> 00:37:58,833
Ni Hao!

358
00:37:59,334 --> 00:38:00,999
Where'd you disappear to?

359
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:02,374
Brooklyn.

360
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,541
Let me introduce your new neighbor.

361
00:38:17,584 --> 00:38:20,041
Okay, no problem. Bye!

362
00:38:20,209 --> 00:38:21,166
Bye!

363
00:41:00,834 --> 00:41:04,708
Nothingness...

364
00:41:12,042 --> 00:41:13,666
- Hegel?
- Yes.

365
00:41:17,334 --> 00:41:18,624
Come in.

366
00:41:19,959 --> 00:41:20,874
Thank you.

367
00:41:21,042 --> 00:41:21,749
You write, too?

368
00:41:22,959 --> 00:41:24,041
Yeah.

369
00:41:24,375 --> 00:41:25,958
What are you writing?

370
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,833
A book called "Chinese Puzzle."

371
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,958
It's a novel about

372
00:41:31,292 --> 00:41:34,291
how complicated life is.
Well, sort of.

373
00:41:36,292 --> 00:41:40,583
I wrote a book called
"The Phenomenology of Spirit" -

374
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:42,791
"Phänomenologie des Geistes."

375
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:46,458
My book presents
a simple vision of life.

376
00:41:46,625 --> 00:41:47,249
Really?

377
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,874
Boy, am I jealous.

378
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:53,541
Thank you.

379
00:41:54,959 --> 00:41:56,541
Can you quote me something?

380
00:41:58,917 --> 00:42:02,583
"All nothingness
is the nothing of something."

381
00:42:06,417 --> 00:42:09,291
"All nothingness
is the nothing of..."

382
00:42:14,459 --> 00:42:15,708
Hegel?

383
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:17,874
Hegel?

384
00:42:18,459 --> 00:42:19,833
Hegel?

385
00:42:23,167 --> 00:42:25,249
When you begin a new story,

386
00:42:25,542 --> 00:42:27,583
your job is to envision.

387
00:42:28,667 --> 00:42:32,083
To try to glimpse stuff
that doesn't as yet exist.

388
00:42:35,917 --> 00:42:37,333
That's what writing is.

389
00:42:37,584 --> 00:42:40,791
Going out to meet
the ghosts of the future.

390
00:42:41,084 --> 00:42:44,499
Not out of the past, not the ones
that are dead and buried.

391
00:42:44,667 --> 00:42:46,208
Ghosts of the future.

392
00:42:46,709 --> 00:42:48,374
Those who don't exist yet.

393
00:43:01,542 --> 00:43:02,791
Great!

394
00:43:05,042 --> 00:43:05,666
Here.

395
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:09,124
It doesn't have to be perfect.

396
00:43:20,625 --> 00:43:22,291
How's it going, Tom?

397
00:43:24,292 --> 00:43:27,291
- Almost done.
- Very, very soon.

398
00:43:27,459 --> 00:43:30,458
- Just that little bit there.
- We're fast workers!

399
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:37,874
Mommy doesn't let us eat McDonald's.

400
00:43:38,042 --> 00:43:39,124
Really?

401
00:43:39,584 --> 00:43:40,666
Why?

402
00:43:40,834 --> 00:43:42,791
She says it's no good.

403
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:44,791
Really?

404
00:43:45,875 --> 00:43:47,041
Oh, shit!

405
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:50,874
So you don't want anymore?

406
00:45:19,709 --> 00:45:22,416
Saturday is "daddy day"
at the playground.

407
00:45:25,667 --> 00:45:27,624
Mia, take it easy!

408
00:45:57,209 --> 00:45:58,291
Easy, Mia!

409
00:46:01,167 --> 00:46:02,458
Let's go home.

410
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:24,708
Let's go home.

411
00:46:25,875 --> 00:46:27,666
Say goodbye.

412
00:46:37,375 --> 00:46:39,458
Coming, Tom?

413
00:46:45,084 --> 00:46:49,666
Ray laid out a whole theory about
divorced fathers being warriors.

414
00:46:49,834 --> 00:46:52,041
Guys who won't let go of their kids.

415
00:46:54,375 --> 00:46:55,374
Tom.

416
00:46:56,292 --> 00:46:57,208
Tom.

417
00:46:57,792 --> 00:47:00,791
"The new 21st century adventurers,"
he said.

418
00:47:00,959 --> 00:47:02,374
Want your banana?

419
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:08,910
I'll see you in a week, okay?

420
00:47:08,959 --> 00:47:11,749
One beddy-bye, 2 beddy-byes,
3, 4, 5, 6...

421
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:15,999
Bye.

422
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:19,583
Daddy's kiss!

423
00:48:34,334 --> 00:48:36,874
Why the fuck
would you take this asshole?

424
00:48:37,042 --> 00:48:39,374
Why the fuck
would you call me an asshole?

425
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,541
You speak Spanish!

426
00:48:41,917 --> 00:48:43,458
I studied in Spain, man.

427
00:48:54,792 --> 00:48:57,249
Thanks to Ray,
I started guzzling asphalt.

428
00:49:25,542 --> 00:49:29,958
Pinned to the ground, you see that
New York's obsession is the sky.

429
00:49:30,542 --> 00:49:32,416
The image NYC sells

430
00:49:32,584 --> 00:49:34,541
is the skyline, skyscrapers,

431
00:49:34,875 --> 00:49:36,749
penthouses, rooftops.

432
00:49:36,917 --> 00:49:40,374
All anybody cares about
is reaching for the sky.

433
00:49:40,542 --> 00:49:43,124
In reality, the city's split in two.

434
00:49:43,917 --> 00:49:47,791
When you first get here,
you can't be part of the "up" world.

435
00:49:47,959 --> 00:49:50,958
You belong in the "down" world.
You live downtown.

436
00:49:51,417 --> 00:49:52,791
You have no right to the sky.

437
00:49:52,959 --> 00:49:56,166
You gotta work your way up
from the bottom.

438
00:49:56,334 --> 00:49:57,874
The New York asphalt

439
00:49:58,084 --> 00:50:01,124
is like a boxer's skin after a bout.

440
00:50:01,875 --> 00:50:03,041
The skin of a zombie -

441
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:06,958
a tattoo, body-piercing,
crack, scarification junkie.

442
00:50:08,042 --> 00:50:11,583
So that's my life in New York
at the moment.

443
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,624
Things any better with Wendy,

444
00:50:13,959 --> 00:50:15,458
now that you're settled?

445
00:50:17,792 --> 00:50:18,916
No.

446
00:50:27,417 --> 00:50:29,583
I should've just told her the truth.

447
00:50:30,584 --> 00:50:33,624
We're driving along,
we get stuck in traffic...

448
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,249
Nothing unusual.

449
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,708
The guy tried to get out.

450
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:40,958
But he'd turned
onto West 11th Street.

451
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,374
And West 11th Street
is a rarity in New York.

452
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:46,666
It's not completely straight.

453
00:50:46,834 --> 00:50:48,499
It elbows down, branches off.

454
00:50:49,167 --> 00:50:52,041
So we're in that
little West Village maze

455
00:50:52,209 --> 00:50:54,374
and stop at the corner of West 4th.

456
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:55,958
No, not here.

457
00:50:56,125 --> 00:50:58,999
Streets are supposed
to run parallel, not cross!

458
00:50:59,167 --> 00:51:00,999
So the guy loses it.

459
00:51:14,584 --> 00:51:15,749
So the truck driver says...

460
00:51:16,625 --> 00:51:17,833
Then the shit hit the fan.

461
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,249
Holy shit.

462
00:51:29,542 --> 00:51:32,249
The guy blows a gasket,
hops out of the car

463
00:51:32,417 --> 00:51:35,041
and he gets bashed
with the baseball bat.

464
00:52:11,625 --> 00:52:13,499
So now I'm driving a yellow cab

465
00:52:13,667 --> 00:52:16,041
in some tawdry
Manhattan detective story.

466
00:52:24,125 --> 00:52:27,041
I pull up at E.R.
with my unconscious Chinaman.

467
00:52:27,209 --> 00:52:29,208
I should have just
told Wendy that but...

468
00:52:42,042 --> 00:52:43,833
What's wild is the Chinese guy

469
00:52:44,334 --> 00:52:45,666
had just moved to New York.

470
00:52:46,125 --> 00:52:48,541
And that corner contradicted

471
00:52:48,709 --> 00:52:51,041
his entire image of America.

472
00:52:51,667 --> 00:52:54,166
He'd heard it was simple
and organized.

473
00:52:54,334 --> 00:52:58,499
That New York was laid out
in a mathematical grid

474
00:52:58,959 --> 00:53:00,124
to simplify things.

475
00:53:00,625 --> 00:53:03,916
But the fact is
things are never simple.

476
00:53:04,292 --> 00:53:05,249
See what I mean?

477
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:08,958
Could you knock out
something a tad more linear

478
00:53:09,667 --> 00:53:11,249
by next week?

479
00:53:11,625 --> 00:53:14,166
Next week? Sure.
I'll give it all I've got.

480
00:53:18,709 --> 00:53:20,166
I don't believe this!

481
00:53:22,417 --> 00:53:24,374
- Hi, there!
- Hi, Martine.

482
00:53:24,542 --> 00:53:27,708
Listen, Xavier,
can you do me a favor?

483
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,708
Sounds scary but go ahead.

484
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,124
I'm coming to New York.
Can you pick me up at the airport?

485
00:53:35,042 --> 00:53:36,708
That's kind of complicated
because...

486
00:53:36,959 --> 00:53:39,958
If I come to New York,
I'd hate to miss you.

487
00:53:40,125 --> 00:53:42,374
No, of course.
I'll figure it out.

488
00:53:42,542 --> 00:53:43,874
Don't worry, I'll be there.

489
00:54:36,084 --> 00:54:36,833
Ni Hao.

490
00:54:37,875 --> 00:54:39,333
Is that him?

491
00:55:08,792 --> 00:55:09,666
What did he say?

492
00:55:09,834 --> 00:55:11,874
He says he's looking

493
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:13,583
for a wife.

494
00:55:17,667 --> 00:55:20,333
It's so weird to see you here.

495
00:55:21,792 --> 00:55:23,333
I feel like I'm in Barcelona.

496
00:55:24,584 --> 00:55:26,499
You really are a nut job.

497
00:55:27,084 --> 00:55:29,333
So what are you doing here?

498
00:55:29,584 --> 00:55:33,249
I have to meet a guy named Zhang Yu
who's based in New York.

499
00:55:33,417 --> 00:55:36,583
He's sort of the "Mr. Tea"
for all of China.

500
00:55:38,167 --> 00:55:40,624
I'm trying to get his support

501
00:55:40,792 --> 00:55:45,249
in setting up a reliable brand
of Chinese-produced organic tea.

502
00:55:45,584 --> 00:55:48,958
Because food safety
in the global environment

503
00:55:49,125 --> 00:55:51,291
is "the" hot issue these days.

504
00:55:51,459 --> 00:55:53,124
And don't laugh at me.

505
00:55:53,459 --> 00:55:57,333
Boy, you've really changed.
You used to wanna save the world.

506
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:00,166
Business is a great way
of saving the world.

507
00:56:00,334 --> 00:56:03,083
Think of the impact
this could have.

508
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:06,708
It would be like bringing
an organic mindset to China.

509
00:56:06,875 --> 00:56:09,041
And not just for tea!

510
00:56:09,209 --> 00:56:12,041
Then there's soy or...

511
00:56:12,209 --> 00:56:14,666
It could be a real revolution!

512
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,166
Hello.

513
00:56:22,125 --> 00:56:23,499
Oh, shit!

514
00:56:24,792 --> 00:56:25,833
How high a fever?

515
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:30,041
Of course you're a good mother!

516
00:56:30,209 --> 00:56:32,708
You're away on business
and she got sick.

517
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,999
It's not your fault.

518
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:38,583
She's dumb, too.
Why get sick on the day I leave?

519
00:56:39,334 --> 00:56:41,124
I've obsessed about this meeting
for months.

520
00:56:43,792 --> 00:56:45,249
I don't know why but

521
00:56:45,959 --> 00:56:48,499
things never jibe for me.

522
00:56:48,792 --> 00:56:50,249
They're never in sync.

523
00:56:50,834 --> 00:56:51,874
I don't know why.

524
00:56:52,042 --> 00:56:54,666
Relax, I know exactly what you mean.

525
00:57:05,875 --> 00:57:07,999
Do I look okay?
Not too pathetic?

526
00:57:08,167 --> 00:57:12,083
You don't look pathetic
and you're not a lousy mother.

527
00:57:13,875 --> 00:57:15,083
I'll call the pediatrician.

528
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:17,083
Don't call him back.

529
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:20,708
Sonia's there, don't worry.
It's under control.

530
00:57:20,875 --> 00:57:23,124
Go to your meeting
and knock 'em dead!

531
00:57:23,584 --> 00:57:24,424
I should get going...

532
00:57:24,542 --> 00:57:26,916
Would you stay for the meeting?

533
00:57:28,375 --> 00:57:29,499
You want me to?

534
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:32,458
We'll say you're my assistant.

535
00:57:37,334 --> 00:57:39,333
You're fine.

536
00:59:37,584 --> 00:59:39,916
She seems to be a little better.

537
00:59:41,292 --> 00:59:42,999
I can't find a single ticket.

538
00:59:43,167 --> 00:59:45,374
Forget about leaving tonight.

539
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:50,208
You sure I can stay at your place?

540
00:59:50,584 --> 00:59:52,374
Scared I'll rape you?

541
00:59:59,042 --> 01:00:00,333
Good night.

542
01:00:03,792 --> 01:00:04,833
Good night!

543
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,624
Yeah, I said good night.

544
01:00:39,167 --> 01:00:40,416
Martine!

545
01:00:42,667 --> 01:00:44,374
What? Am I embarrassing you?

546
01:00:45,125 --> 01:00:46,708
No, but...

547
01:00:47,667 --> 01:00:50,791
Let's not make things
more complicated than they are.

548
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,374
Sleeping in the same bed
doesn't mean...

549
01:00:53,542 --> 01:00:55,374
We're sleeping in the same bed,

550
01:00:55,792 --> 01:00:57,624
I'm cuddling.

551
01:00:57,792 --> 01:00:59,708
What's complicated about that?

552
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:10,999
Martine!

553
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:11,667
What?

554
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,333
Martine, that's my dick!

555
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:14,708
I know.

556
01:01:17,209 --> 01:01:18,999
It's been a really long time...

557
01:01:20,875 --> 01:01:22,749
since I fucked.

558
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:25,499
How about you?

559
01:01:44,125 --> 01:01:46,249
"Go deeper..."

560
01:01:46,709 --> 01:01:47,958
What?

561
01:01:49,334 --> 01:01:50,958
- What?
- Nothing.

562
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:53,124
Boy, you really have changed!

563
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:55,166
You'd never have said that before.

564
01:01:55,334 --> 01:01:57,333
I wanted to.

565
01:01:57,584 --> 01:01:59,458
Gimme a break! I'm getting old.

566
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:01,708
I'm not gonna spend my life...

567
01:02:03,125 --> 01:02:05,083
I'm gonna be 40.

568
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:08,041
I know what I like
and I say so.

569
01:02:08,709 --> 01:02:10,874
If that sounds slutty, too bad!

570
01:02:11,042 --> 01:02:13,374
No way!
On the contrary, I love it.

571
01:02:20,084 --> 01:02:21,791
"Go deeper..."

572
01:02:21,959 --> 01:02:23,416
Stop!

573
01:02:34,875 --> 01:02:36,249
Wait! Xavier!

574
01:02:46,959 --> 01:02:48,583
See? We made it!

575
01:02:58,417 --> 01:03:01,208
- Maybe we shouldn't have done it.
- I know...

576
01:03:01,875 --> 01:03:04,083
I'm not so sure it was a good idea.

577
01:03:07,792 --> 01:03:09,291
Okay, bye.

578
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:34,499
I'm just happy
we came to an agreement.

579
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:11,291
I didn't have the nerve to tell her
I was getting married, too.

580
01:07:11,459 --> 01:07:13,999
And that I clearly wasn't crazy

581
01:07:14,542 --> 01:07:16,958
about her coming to my wedding.

582
01:07:33,375 --> 01:07:34,666
Mia, you could smile.

583
01:07:34,834 --> 01:07:36,999
- I did smile.
- Okay.

584
01:07:37,834 --> 01:07:39,416
Oh, right! This is Nancy,

585
01:07:39,584 --> 01:07:42,999
my American wife, who I've been
madly in love with for a month.

586
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:47,208
And the 3 days we spent
fabricating a relationship.

587
01:07:47,375 --> 01:07:49,166
Immigration Services would buy.

588
01:08:02,875 --> 01:08:04,041
I don't understand.

589
01:08:14,667 --> 01:08:17,416
I lucked out.
She was a great sport.

590
01:08:21,792 --> 01:08:24,208
On the other hand,
the Immigration guy

591
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,458
wasn't such a great sport.

592
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:23,166
"We're not there yet."

593
01:12:53,084 --> 01:12:53,999
Dad?

594
01:12:54,167 --> 01:12:56,999
My father called to say
he was coming to New York.

595
01:12:57,167 --> 01:12:58,458
Is everything okay?

596
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:00,499
I was surprised.

597
01:13:00,792 --> 01:13:03,166
We hadn't seen each other in ages.

598
01:13:03,625 --> 01:13:07,041
I thought about how my father
never did any of the stuff

599
01:13:07,209 --> 01:13:08,791
I did for my kids.

600
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:11,374
Not just the happy, eventful times,

601
01:13:11,792 --> 01:13:14,708
but even the uneventful moments,
like this.

602
01:13:16,417 --> 01:13:18,416
When you think nothing's happening.

603
01:13:18,584 --> 01:13:21,666
They seem meaningless but,
in fact, they're important.

604
01:13:22,209 --> 01:13:24,166
Because those empty moments

605
01:13:24,667 --> 01:13:26,499
are also part of life.

606
01:13:27,334 --> 01:13:29,041
That's what childhood is.

607
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:31,791
And I'd missed that.

608
01:13:33,959 --> 01:13:35,458
I'd missed him.

609
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:45,666
This has all really changed.
It's unrecognizable.

610
01:13:48,125 --> 01:13:49,916
We walked for hours.

611
01:13:50,542 --> 01:13:52,499
He talked about
the New York he knew.

612
01:13:52,667 --> 01:13:53,874
He didn't ask one question about me

613
01:13:54,042 --> 01:13:56,916
or the New York of today
I might know.

614
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,833
We didn't have much
to say to each other.

615
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,374
As if being apart when I was little

616
01:14:05,750 --> 01:14:07,833
made for too little complicity,

617
01:14:08,125 --> 01:14:09,999
too few topics of conversation.

618
01:14:12,959 --> 01:14:13,916
What?

619
01:14:14,084 --> 01:14:15,208
Hold on...

620
01:14:16,542 --> 01:14:19,833
Your mom and I once
wrote our initials in the cement.

621
01:14:21,834 --> 01:14:25,249
My J and her S
with a heart around them.

622
01:14:25,834 --> 01:14:28,583
One of those goofy things you do
when you're 20.

623
01:14:29,167 --> 01:14:30,708
We looked a little longer.

624
01:14:31,334 --> 01:14:33,999
We saw something
that looked like a heart

625
01:14:34,167 --> 01:14:36,291
but time must have worn it away.

626
01:14:44,584 --> 01:14:46,583
Great! Everything okay?

627
01:14:49,542 --> 01:14:52,583
I don't know.
Let me think it over.

628
01:14:55,709 --> 01:14:57,041
I'll call you back.

629
01:14:59,375 --> 01:15:00,624
Anything serious?

630
01:15:00,792 --> 01:15:02,166
Isabelle had just given birth

631
01:15:02,334 --> 01:15:05,291
and asked if I wanted
to recognize the baby.

632
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,333
- Remember my friend Isabelle?
- Yeah.

633
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:11,124
I hesitated to tell him
the whole story.

634
01:15:11,667 --> 01:15:14,624
But in the end,
I told my father everything.

635
01:15:15,084 --> 01:15:18,541
And now she's asking
if I wanna recognize the baby and...

636
01:15:19,834 --> 01:15:21,291
I remember, all he said was...

637
01:15:21,459 --> 01:15:23,958
Don't get involved in that shit.

638
01:15:26,667 --> 01:15:28,333
Well, if I were you...

639
01:15:30,209 --> 01:15:31,374
Bye!

640
01:15:32,667 --> 01:15:33,833
After he left,

641
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:36,874
I realized
I had tons of questions for him.

642
01:15:37,375 --> 01:15:39,124
Why had he and Mom split up?

643
01:15:39,292 --> 01:15:41,708
Did they really love each other?

644
01:15:41,875 --> 01:15:42,791
But...

645
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:48,708
Then without really knowing why,

646
01:15:49,334 --> 01:15:51,624
I walked home on Avenue A.

647
01:15:52,167 --> 01:15:54,291
And at the corner
of Saint Mark's Place...

648
01:15:56,334 --> 01:15:59,541
My father got the street right
but the avenue wrong.

649
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:02,583
It wasn't First Avenue,
it was Avenue A.

650
01:16:03,167 --> 01:16:05,499
There, on the streets of this city,

651
01:16:05,667 --> 01:16:06,749
it was carved.

652
01:16:06,917 --> 01:16:09,749
A trace of something
I'd never really known.

653
01:16:10,500 --> 01:16:13,916
Here, in New York, at the corner
of 8th Street and Avenue A,

654
01:16:14,125 --> 01:16:15,916
my parents were in love.

655
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:18,749
Those tiny initials in the sidewalk

656
01:16:18,917 --> 01:16:20,791
held a kind of fundamental proof

657
01:16:20,959 --> 01:16:23,166
that my birth wasn't
a total accident.

658
01:16:23,334 --> 01:16:26,083
Two people were in love.
Really in love.

659
01:16:26,417 --> 01:16:28,208
Even if they weren't together long.

660
01:16:28,375 --> 01:16:30,833
No matter why
they eventually broke up.

661
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:34,541
All that mattered now
were those tiny initials.

662
01:17:42,667 --> 01:17:44,291
- Dumb question.
- Spit it out.

663
01:17:44,459 --> 01:17:47,541
Do either you or Ju
take on the daddy role?

664
01:17:50,792 --> 01:17:51,916
I adore you!

665
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:55,583
Guess what?
I found a Belgian babysitter

666
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:57,833
who did Erasmus in Barcelona!

667
01:18:00,042 --> 01:18:00,874
Isabelle?

668
01:18:01,375 --> 01:18:02,083
Isabelle!

669
01:18:02,709 --> 01:18:03,374
Yeah?

670
01:18:04,250 --> 01:18:06,624
I mean my name's Isabelle, too.

671
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:07,916
Okay, sorry.

672
01:18:08,084 --> 01:18:09,208
No need to be sorry.

673
01:18:09,584 --> 01:18:10,999
Hi. Come on in.

674
01:18:11,167 --> 01:18:12,666
Sorry... I mean, hi.

675
01:18:15,292 --> 01:18:17,583
Let me explain
'cause we have to run.

676
01:18:18,167 --> 01:18:20,333
You've taken care of infants before?

677
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:21,208
No.

678
01:18:22,417 --> 01:18:23,416
I mean, yeah. Yeah.

679
01:18:23,667 --> 01:18:24,541
Well, I mean...

680
01:18:24,709 --> 01:18:27,374
Sort of.
I have tons of brothers and sisters.

681
01:18:27,542 --> 01:18:30,749
I've never done it professionally
but it's like I have.

682
01:18:31,584 --> 01:18:32,666
See what I mean?

683
01:18:33,459 --> 01:18:34,333
Yeah, I see.

684
01:18:34,834 --> 01:18:35,499
Hi!

685
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:42,874
Pretty girl, huh?

686
01:18:50,542 --> 01:18:51,624
Not my type.

687
01:18:51,917 --> 01:18:52,999
Really?

688
01:18:53,834 --> 01:18:55,458
We never had the same taste!

689
01:18:56,542 --> 01:18:58,208
That's for sure!

690
01:18:59,375 --> 01:19:01,499
Wanna go to a dyke bar later?

691
01:19:01,959 --> 01:19:03,583
Can't! With all my legal fees,

692
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:06,291
I took a gig here tonight
for big bucks!

693
01:19:06,459 --> 01:19:08,416
Cool! We'll stay here!

694
01:19:08,584 --> 01:19:10,291
- You wanna stay?
- Yeah.

695
01:19:10,459 --> 01:19:11,666
- You sure?
- Yeah!

696
01:19:12,167 --> 01:19:13,999
- I'll be over there.
- I'm watching!

697
01:19:27,209 --> 01:19:30,374
I was really good!
I didn't even pick up a girl!

698
01:19:30,542 --> 01:19:34,499
Even though I was dying to hump
that nymphette like this.

699
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:37,541
Ever see me piss standing up?

700
01:19:37,834 --> 01:19:39,666
- No.
- You're not the only one,

701
01:19:39,834 --> 01:19:41,416
I can do it, too. Watch!

702
01:19:41,584 --> 01:19:44,666
- You can't piss here.
- I'm just demonstrating!

703
01:19:44,834 --> 01:19:46,749
It's after 4 o'clock.

704
01:19:47,334 --> 01:19:48,333
Oh, shit.

705
01:19:49,042 --> 01:19:50,333
Oh, shit...

706
01:19:50,709 --> 01:19:52,416
Shit, I said 2 o'clock.

707
01:19:52,584 --> 01:19:54,291
Fuck!

708
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,124
Hello.

709
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:05,499
You okay?

710
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:07,708
I'm sorry.

711
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:11,749
I said 2 at the latest.
I think it's 4. I'm really sorry.

712
01:20:14,667 --> 01:20:15,833
Everything go okay?

713
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,208
Oh, yeah, great.

714
01:20:17,375 --> 01:20:20,833
It went really well.
She's incredibly cute.

715
01:20:21,292 --> 01:20:25,083
She went right to sleep
and never woke up.

716
01:20:29,875 --> 01:20:31,166
Could your husband

717
01:20:31,334 --> 01:20:34,874
take me home or call me a cab?
It's kind of late.

718
01:20:35,417 --> 01:20:38,249
Sorry.
There's something you should know.

719
01:20:38,417 --> 01:20:40,499
This guy's not my husband.

720
01:20:41,417 --> 01:20:43,291
I thought he was the father.

721
01:20:43,459 --> 01:20:44,583
Yeah, yeah!

722
01:20:44,750 --> 01:20:47,958
He's the father but not my husband.
I live with a woman.

723
01:20:48,709 --> 01:20:49,999
With a woman?

724
01:20:51,042 --> 01:20:53,124
Yeah. A woman.

725
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,291
Oh, yeah. Okay!

726
01:20:58,542 --> 01:21:00,083
You have seen lesbians before?

727
01:21:00,709 --> 01:21:02,249
Yeah, yeah.

728
01:21:02,625 --> 01:21:03,749
No, yeah. Sure.

729
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:11,124
Can you watch Kitty and my trains
and build her house?

730
01:21:11,292 --> 01:21:13,749
Okay. I'm building her house.

731
01:21:14,125 --> 01:21:15,583
But it's not her lunchtime.

732
01:21:15,750 --> 01:21:16,749
No.

733
01:21:18,959 --> 01:21:21,916
If she groans,
ask her what's wrong.

734
01:21:22,084 --> 01:21:23,374
Okay.

735
01:21:23,542 --> 01:21:25,666
If she's hungry, give her

736
01:21:25,834 --> 01:21:26,874
some crackers.

737
01:21:29,084 --> 01:21:30,958
- Hi, Xavier.
- Hi.

738
01:21:31,125 --> 01:21:32,624
- You progressing?
- Yeah.

739
01:21:32,792 --> 01:21:33,666
How's it going?

740
01:21:33,834 --> 01:21:36,541
I'm working my ass off.
I'm almost done.

741
01:21:36,834 --> 01:21:38,041
I have a secret.

742
01:21:38,209 --> 01:21:39,624
Why can't I see you?

743
01:21:39,792 --> 01:21:42,541
I can't seem to get the camera
to work.

744
01:21:42,709 --> 01:21:44,333
Neither can I.

745
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:46,499
I have sound but no image.

746
01:21:46,709 --> 01:21:49,166
I'll call you in a few days,
when I'm done.

747
01:21:49,334 --> 01:21:50,458
Without fail!

748
01:21:50,709 --> 01:21:54,208
The publishers' congress
is in 2 weeks. I need it.

749
01:21:54,375 --> 01:21:55,583
I know.

750
01:21:55,750 --> 01:21:59,374
They're all waiting.
I can't show up empty-handed.

751
01:21:59,542 --> 01:22:01,833
It's really important, understand?

752
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:07,041
I understand, don't worry.
I'll call you in a few days, okay?

753
01:22:07,209 --> 01:22:08,499
Okay, take care.

754
01:22:08,667 --> 01:22:09,916
Okay, bye.

755
01:22:10,709 --> 01:22:14,583
Mia, how many times do I have to
tell you? When Daddy's on the phone,

756
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:16,833
he's doing very important stuff.

757
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:19,833
I'm done.

758
01:22:20,917 --> 01:22:22,083
Let's see.

759
01:22:24,542 --> 01:22:25,583
Did you do them all?

760
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,458
Oh, no. There's one more.

761
01:22:29,625 --> 01:22:32,458
Tom, you have to work
systematically.

762
01:22:32,625 --> 01:22:34,208
Otherwise, we're lost.

763
01:22:35,209 --> 01:22:38,666
You have to do them all.
See, it says to do them all.

764
01:22:38,875 --> 01:22:41,124
You've gotta be a little more...

765
01:22:41,875 --> 01:22:42,958
Understand?

766
01:22:44,084 --> 01:22:46,624
Mia, shall I feed her or wait?

767
01:22:50,834 --> 01:22:52,124
So, you getting laid?

768
01:22:54,250 --> 01:22:56,458
No, it's zilch
in the chick department.

769
01:22:56,625 --> 01:22:57,999
You gotta get laid.

770
01:22:58,250 --> 01:23:01,749
I'm not saying fall in love.
But I know you. You gotta...

771
01:23:06,959 --> 01:23:08,166
And you?

772
01:23:11,250 --> 01:23:11,999
No way!

773
01:23:12,667 --> 01:23:15,041
Hey, mum's the word! No kidding.

774
01:23:15,209 --> 01:23:17,541
Of course. Go on, spill it.

775
01:23:24,042 --> 01:23:25,083
I don't believe it!

776
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:26,999
She really annoyed me.

777
01:23:27,334 --> 01:23:29,166
You sleep with everyone
who annoys you?

778
01:23:29,334 --> 01:23:30,083
No, but...

779
01:23:31,125 --> 01:23:34,333
I couldn't find another babysitter,
so I asked her back.

780
01:23:43,292 --> 01:23:44,249
It all went smoothly?

781
01:23:44,417 --> 01:23:45,541
Yeah.

782
01:23:48,834 --> 01:23:50,041
Can I give you a lift?

783
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:05,833
It really is beautiful here.

784
01:24:07,084 --> 01:24:08,333
The bridge...

785
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,124
all that.

786
01:24:10,292 --> 01:24:11,583
I love it!

787
01:24:11,834 --> 01:24:13,333
I often work till 9

788
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:16,166
and bike home.
That's even more beautiful.

789
01:24:32,209 --> 01:24:34,291
I can't drive you tonight,
Ju's away.

790
01:24:34,459 --> 01:24:36,124
I'll just take the subway.

791
01:24:36,292 --> 01:24:38,208
No, I'll pay for a taxi.

792
01:24:38,375 --> 01:24:39,458
That's nice.

793
01:25:01,834 --> 01:25:02,999
I'm sorry.

794
01:25:03,542 --> 01:25:04,666
Then what?

795
01:25:04,917 --> 01:25:07,249
Then we saw each other again and...

796
01:25:08,667 --> 01:25:10,916
She's crazy about me.
I'm in deep shit.

797
01:25:11,584 --> 01:25:12,499
Shit.

798
01:25:14,334 --> 01:25:15,291
And Ju?

799
01:25:16,334 --> 01:25:18,083
What about Ju? Ju's great!

800
01:25:18,250 --> 01:25:20,333
- Yeah, Ju's great.
- Yeah, Ju's great!

801
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:23,166
Yeah, Ju's great.
I really like her.

802
01:25:23,334 --> 01:25:24,458
Fuck, Isabelle!

803
01:25:25,042 --> 01:25:27,708
You're so lucky
to have a stable relationship...

804
01:25:27,875 --> 01:25:28,999
Take it easy!

805
01:25:29,292 --> 01:25:30,958
Why do you need a kid like that?

806
01:25:31,334 --> 01:25:33,958
Are you gonna lecture me now?

807
01:25:34,334 --> 01:25:35,499
I'm not lecturing you.

808
01:25:35,667 --> 01:25:37,916
I've tried to stop, believe me.

809
01:25:38,084 --> 01:25:40,249
I said,
"I don't wanna see you anymore."

810
01:25:42,084 --> 01:25:42,708
And?

811
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:53,208
Isabelle!

812
01:26:36,917 --> 01:26:39,208
I can't resist that, Xavier.

813
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:41,166
It's just so yummy.

814
01:26:41,334 --> 01:26:42,708
She's beautiful, she's...

815
01:26:42,875 --> 01:26:44,999
she's young! I don't know...

816
01:26:45,167 --> 01:26:46,874
She's alive!

817
01:26:47,459 --> 01:26:49,499
And Ju's not alive?

818
01:26:49,667 --> 01:26:50,958
Sure, but...

819
01:26:51,125 --> 01:26:53,374
I need to know
that spark's still there,

820
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:56,083
that I still can, that I'm still...

821
01:26:57,125 --> 01:26:58,124
That you're still what?

822
01:26:58,292 --> 01:27:00,833
Take it easy, Xavier!
Know what I think?

823
01:27:01,417 --> 01:27:03,291
I think you're jealous.

824
01:27:03,459 --> 01:27:05,708
And you need to get laid, too!

825
01:27:06,709 --> 01:27:08,208
I know you like a book!

826
01:27:08,542 --> 01:27:10,791
You just need to get laid.
Fuck some chick!

827
01:27:10,959 --> 01:27:12,333
Anyone. A slut, anybody!

828
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:14,916
Because you're turning
into an asshole!

829
01:27:15,625 --> 01:27:17,666
I'd love to get laid!

830
01:27:17,834 --> 01:27:19,916
But with work, the kids...

831
01:27:20,334 --> 01:27:21,708
My head's not into it.

832
01:27:24,709 --> 01:27:26,333
I don't wanna talk about it.

833
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,208
Martine and her kids came to NYC
for Easter vacation.

834
01:27:43,375 --> 01:27:44,958
I'm really sorry.

835
01:27:45,125 --> 01:27:46,249
Did you forget us?

836
01:27:46,417 --> 01:27:48,083
No, I was just over there.

837
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,083
Hi, kids!

838
01:27:50,250 --> 01:27:51,041
Hi!

839
01:27:51,209 --> 01:27:52,749
How's it going?

840
01:27:54,042 --> 01:27:56,624
Hey, Xavier, I've got a question.

841
01:27:56,792 --> 01:27:58,833
You got a new girlfriend?

842
01:28:00,042 --> 01:28:03,583
Can't you say hello
before asking questions like that?

843
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:05,791
The kid's got no manners.
Sorry.

844
01:28:05,959 --> 01:28:08,333
Now Xavier can answer your question.

845
01:28:08,500 --> 01:28:09,708
So, Xavier?

846
01:28:10,334 --> 01:28:11,708
No, I live alone.

847
01:28:11,875 --> 01:28:13,083
Ni Hao.

848
01:28:13,625 --> 01:28:14,583
Let me help you.

849
01:28:14,750 --> 01:28:16,208
Watch the door!

850
01:28:18,750 --> 01:28:22,291
Ever since we broke up,
he's been very lonely and sad.

851
01:28:22,459 --> 01:28:24,208
After your mom dumped me,

852
01:28:24,375 --> 01:28:26,749
I fell madly in love
with a fabulous woman.

853
01:28:26,917 --> 01:28:29,916
She was so fabulous
she dumped him, just like Mommy.

854
01:28:30,375 --> 01:28:32,249
But otherwise, she was fabulous.

855
01:28:34,042 --> 01:28:34,999
Where's Tom and Mia?

856
01:28:35,167 --> 01:28:36,249
Where are they?

857
01:28:36,917 --> 01:28:39,458
They spend every other week with me.

858
01:28:39,625 --> 01:28:40,958
They'll be here soon.

859
01:28:43,750 --> 01:28:44,958
Come on!

860
01:28:46,792 --> 01:28:49,333
What's that over there?
What's that?

861
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:50,749
See that?

862
01:28:50,917 --> 01:28:52,999
What bridge is that?

863
01:28:53,500 --> 01:28:54,624
The Manhattan Bridge!

864
01:28:55,167 --> 01:28:56,666
That's the Brooklyn Bridge.

865
01:28:57,292 --> 01:29:00,458
Too bad it's cloudy. On a clear day,
you can see Barcelona!

866
01:29:00,625 --> 01:29:01,791
Really?

867
01:29:01,959 --> 01:29:02,958
Go to sleep.

868
01:29:03,125 --> 01:29:05,999
Tom, get in bed.

869
01:29:06,167 --> 01:29:07,374
Got a kiss for Daddy?

870
01:29:09,542 --> 01:29:10,791
Good night. Turn off the light.

871
01:29:10,959 --> 01:29:12,624
Mom, what time is it?

872
01:29:12,792 --> 01:29:14,874
Nine o'clock.
That's 3 AM for you.

873
01:29:15,042 --> 01:29:15,833
Three o'clock!

874
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,333
Time for some shut-eye.

875
01:29:20,334 --> 01:29:22,249
And don't make a ruckus.

876
01:29:22,417 --> 01:29:24,291
It's late. That's enough now.

877
01:29:24,459 --> 01:29:25,374
Good night, Tom.

878
01:29:25,542 --> 01:29:26,833
Good night, Daddy.

879
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:27,916
Calm down.

880
01:29:28,084 --> 01:29:30,916
Fat chance! They're so excited.

881
01:29:33,167 --> 01:29:35,999
Where do I sleep?

882
01:29:38,709 --> 01:29:40,249
You can have my room.

883
01:29:58,167 --> 01:29:59,041
Xavier...

884
01:30:02,292 --> 01:30:04,666
I'd love for us
to be in love again.

885
01:30:05,625 --> 01:30:07,083
Does that happen?

886
01:30:07,250 --> 01:30:10,458
I don't know if it happens.
But why not?

887
01:30:10,834 --> 01:30:12,458
We can try.

888
01:30:12,625 --> 01:30:14,541
Even if it doesn't exist,

889
01:30:14,834 --> 01:30:17,333
we can invent things
that don't exist, can't we?

890
01:30:21,584 --> 01:30:22,999
I dunno.

891
01:30:24,417 --> 01:30:28,124
I know you. I knew it would
freak you out if I said that.

892
01:30:29,042 --> 01:30:31,624
We can try, at least.

893
01:30:32,917 --> 01:30:34,749
We're so lucky.

894
01:30:35,375 --> 01:30:38,833
You've got two kids. I've got two.
They get along really well.

895
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:40,749
We know each other inside out.

896
01:30:41,042 --> 01:30:43,208
You know my defects.
I know yours.

897
01:30:45,042 --> 01:30:47,874
We've both been knocked
around by life.

898
01:30:48,584 --> 01:30:50,124
I don't know...

899
01:30:50,709 --> 01:30:52,416
I feel like...

900
01:30:53,125 --> 01:30:55,083
we could make a fresh start.

901
01:30:57,500 --> 01:30:59,166
I'll be honest with you.

902
01:31:00,709 --> 01:31:03,041
I'm scared it'll feel
sort of warmed over.

903
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:06,041
I'm not sure it's possible.

904
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:09,833
On paper, maybe. But I'm not
sure things work like that.

905
01:31:10,167 --> 01:31:11,833
I feel like love's

906
01:31:12,875 --> 01:31:15,708
about confronting the unknown.

907
01:31:16,834 --> 01:31:18,583
There's gotta be a spark.

908
01:31:20,584 --> 01:31:22,541
Know what Cyrulnik says about love?

909
01:31:23,625 --> 01:31:25,291
Know what I say about Cyrulnik?

910
01:31:30,417 --> 01:31:31,166
Look!

911
01:31:32,084 --> 01:31:32,916
Martine, wait!

912
01:31:33,709 --> 01:31:35,166
A tankful of Prince Charmings!

913
01:31:35,334 --> 01:31:37,999
No way! Those aren't princes!

914
01:31:38,167 --> 01:31:39,791
I want that one.

915
01:31:39,959 --> 01:31:41,249
Jade, you pick one, too!

916
01:31:41,417 --> 01:31:42,874
Pick out a prince, girls!

917
01:31:43,750 --> 01:31:45,958
Wanna pick out your Prince Charming?

918
01:31:46,125 --> 01:31:47,708
Can frogs be princesses too?

919
01:31:48,250 --> 01:31:49,708
Sure they can!

920
01:31:49,875 --> 01:31:52,916
Go ahead.
Grab the one you like.

921
01:31:53,084 --> 01:31:55,333
- That one.
- You want a prince, Mommy?

922
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:57,291
I already found my frog!

923
01:31:57,459 --> 01:31:58,999
That one's ugly.

924
01:31:59,209 --> 01:32:01,333
Who wants to kiss him?

925
01:32:01,625 --> 01:32:03,083
Who wants a Prince Charming?

926
01:32:03,334 --> 01:32:04,166
Mia!

927
01:32:04,334 --> 01:32:06,541
- You?
- Not me! Mia.

928
01:32:06,709 --> 01:32:08,874
Now you have to kiss him!

929
01:32:09,417 --> 01:32:10,541
Who wants it?

930
01:32:11,209 --> 01:32:12,874
A little kiss on his head!

931
01:32:13,167 --> 01:32:14,374
One little kiss.

932
01:32:14,917 --> 01:32:16,124
He's so sweet.

933
01:32:16,667 --> 01:32:18,166
Sure you don't want to?

934
01:32:24,750 --> 01:32:26,374
I put a video on for them.

935
01:32:31,459 --> 01:32:33,208
What are you writing these days?

936
01:32:42,417 --> 01:32:43,166
It's done?

937
01:32:43,334 --> 01:32:45,333
No, it's not done.

938
01:32:51,625 --> 01:32:53,291
- Can I read it?
- Yeah.

939
01:33:35,125 --> 01:33:37,833
It's so much better
than what you used to write!

940
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,874
- Really?
- It's really good.

941
01:33:40,334 --> 01:33:41,208
I'm really impressed!

942
01:33:44,084 --> 01:33:46,291
It's funny that you find life
so complicated.

943
01:33:49,334 --> 01:33:50,583
Look at your life or mine...

944
01:33:52,709 --> 01:33:54,874
It's complicated. So what?

945
01:33:56,334 --> 01:33:59,999
I came to New York
to be near my kids,

946
01:34:00,459 --> 01:34:03,999
who I had with a Brit,
who I lived with for 10 years,

947
01:34:04,209 --> 01:34:06,666
who moved here
to be with an American.

948
01:34:06,834 --> 01:34:09,124
I had a baby with 2 lesbians.

949
01:34:09,292 --> 01:34:11,583
I married a Chinese woman
to become an American.

950
01:34:11,750 --> 01:34:12,958
And life's not complicated?

951
01:34:17,667 --> 01:34:20,041
I can tell
you've never lived in China!

952
01:34:20,209 --> 01:34:21,958
What does that mean?

953
01:34:22,125 --> 01:34:23,666
- Mom!
- Coming!

954
01:34:39,292 --> 01:34:40,416
Isn't she beautiful?

955
01:34:41,209 --> 01:34:42,458
She's my neighbor.

956
01:34:45,542 --> 01:34:46,499
Big hit!

957
01:34:49,084 --> 01:34:50,249
Sometimes it works.

958
01:35:09,542 --> 01:35:10,499
What?

959
01:35:11,167 --> 01:35:12,208
Nothing.

960
01:35:29,292 --> 01:35:30,208
Come here!

961
01:35:30,500 --> 01:35:32,374
Be right back.

962
01:35:38,167 --> 01:35:40,083
- What's up?
- I have to see her.

963
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:44,124
Can you babysit?
And slip me your keys?

964
01:35:44,292 --> 01:35:47,374
I warn you, we'll be home
in an hour and a half, max.

965
01:35:48,625 --> 01:35:49,499
Oh!

966
01:35:50,042 --> 01:35:52,541
Okay, thanks.

967
01:35:52,709 --> 01:35:56,124
Give her a bottle in half an hour.

968
01:35:56,292 --> 01:35:57,374
You're a real pain!

969
01:35:57,750 --> 01:36:00,166
Isn't she sort of your daughter,
too?

970
01:36:01,959 --> 01:36:02,999
Yeah, right!

971
01:36:03,250 --> 01:36:04,249
What?

972
01:36:04,417 --> 01:36:06,583
So now I am a father
in the traditional sense?

973
01:36:13,209 --> 01:36:14,416
Hi, Tom!

974
01:36:16,750 --> 01:36:18,166
I'll take off.

975
01:36:19,500 --> 01:36:20,208
Yeah.

976
01:36:25,125 --> 01:36:27,458
Why'd you say
you were her father?

977
01:36:29,209 --> 01:36:30,166
So, that's it.

978
01:36:30,542 --> 01:36:34,916
It's complicated but that's why
she's sort of your little sister.

979
01:36:36,875 --> 01:36:40,458
So she's got two mommies
and one daddy?

980
01:36:41,750 --> 01:36:43,541
Yeah, that's it.

981
01:36:44,334 --> 01:36:47,083
Daddy, can we go on the slide now?

982
01:36:49,750 --> 01:36:50,583
Yeah.

983
01:36:54,917 --> 01:36:55,916
You can go.

984
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,624
I'll watch the baby.

985
01:37:03,917 --> 01:37:05,541
- Thanks.
- No problem.

986
01:37:07,792 --> 01:37:08,374
Mia!

987
01:37:09,417 --> 01:37:10,666
No slipping allowed.

988
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:38,041
Isabelle's got a problem.
I have to go home.

989
01:37:38,209 --> 01:37:40,124
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

990
01:37:40,292 --> 01:37:43,708
- Can you handle them all?
- Sure, no problem.

991
01:37:44,167 --> 01:37:46,124
- We'll meet up later.
- Thanks.

992
01:37:54,209 --> 01:37:55,958
I don't want any interruptions.

993
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:04,999
Fuck, Isabelle!
We're almost 40!

994
01:38:06,875 --> 01:38:08,666
What a fucking pain!

995
01:38:52,084 --> 01:38:53,749
Fuck!

996
01:38:58,459 --> 01:38:59,374
Isabelle!

997
01:39:05,917 --> 01:39:07,499
Isabelle...

998
01:39:07,667 --> 01:39:09,124
Yes, Isabelle...

999
01:39:38,500 --> 01:39:39,458
Ni Hao.

1000
01:39:55,667 --> 01:39:56,749
Isabelle!

1001
01:39:57,875 --> 01:39:59,874
Isabelle, open the window!

1002
01:40:00,084 --> 01:40:00,791
Open up!

1003
01:40:16,667 --> 01:40:18,458
I don't believe this!

1004
01:40:21,834 --> 01:40:22,666
Over here!

1005
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:39,958
Yeah, that's right.

1006
01:42:20,209 --> 01:42:21,916
Hi! How's it going?

1007
01:42:25,959 --> 01:42:27,166
Hello!

1008
01:42:35,250 --> 01:42:37,083
Hi, Maria, how'd it go?

1009
01:42:37,709 --> 01:42:40,041
Thanks a lot for taking the kids.

1010
01:42:40,750 --> 01:42:41,416
Get lost!

1011
01:42:41,584 --> 01:42:42,916
No problem, sir.

1012
01:42:43,084 --> 01:42:45,499
Say goodbye to Maria and her kids.

1013
01:42:45,667 --> 01:42:46,541
Let's go!

1014
01:42:47,042 --> 01:42:47,999
See you tomorrow?

1015
01:42:48,167 --> 01:42:49,791
Yeah, same time tomorrow!

1016
01:42:49,959 --> 01:42:51,374
I'll call you.

1017
01:43:57,584 --> 01:43:59,458
Xavier, I came to pick up the...

1018
01:43:59,625 --> 01:44:00,874
Oh, Ju!

1019
01:44:11,375 --> 01:44:13,624
You doing okay, Mia?

1020
01:44:13,792 --> 01:44:15,166
No shells in the yolks!

1021
01:44:17,042 --> 01:44:18,208
Maria,

1022
01:44:18,375 --> 01:44:20,749
when you're done with the kids,
make dinner.

1023
01:44:20,917 --> 01:44:23,624
Hey, do it yourself, buddy!

1024
01:44:23,792 --> 01:44:25,249
Just kidding.

1025
01:44:30,459 --> 01:44:32,374
Can you help me, Mommy?

1026
01:44:32,959 --> 01:44:34,124
Be right there!

1027
01:44:43,709 --> 01:44:46,208
- I'm so happy to see you!
- Me, too!

1028
01:44:46,375 --> 01:44:48,374
I couldn't believe my eyes.

1029
01:44:48,584 --> 01:44:50,291
They could never stand one another.

1030
01:44:50,459 --> 01:44:54,749
But now that they'd both dumped me,
they were two peas in a pod.

1031
01:44:57,500 --> 01:45:00,166
They insisted
we all go out to eat together.

1032
01:45:00,334 --> 01:45:02,124
Ju offered to watch the kids.

1033
01:45:02,292 --> 01:45:05,999
And I ended up
with Martine, Wendy and Isabelle.

1034
01:45:08,875 --> 01:45:10,541
Whenever I take the NYC subway,

1035
01:45:10,709 --> 01:45:14,458
I'm always humming the Ellington
tune, "Take the A Train."

1036
01:45:29,459 --> 01:45:30,708
He likes feisty chicks.

1037
01:45:34,292 --> 01:45:36,708
Xavier plays his cards
close to his chest.

1038
01:45:36,875 --> 01:45:40,333
I think he needs a tough broad.
If she's too delicate...

1039
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:42,041
Yeah, but sweet.

1040
01:45:46,292 --> 01:45:49,041
What he really needs
is a sensitive girl

1041
01:45:49,209 --> 01:45:49,849
who's attentive.

1042
01:45:49,959 --> 01:45:53,166
Yeah, but not too clingy.
If she's wimpy,

1043
01:45:53,334 --> 01:45:55,333
he'll suffocate.
I can relate to that.

1044
01:45:57,917 --> 01:45:59,791
I agree with you both!

1045
01:46:45,584 --> 01:46:47,208
Sure you don't want a taxi?

1046
01:46:47,417 --> 01:46:49,249
No, the bus is fine.

1047
01:46:49,875 --> 01:46:51,458
Let me help you then!

1048
01:46:51,625 --> 01:46:55,791
No, you have to put Mia to bed.
We're fine.

1049
01:46:55,959 --> 01:46:57,708
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

1050
01:47:00,875 --> 01:47:01,624
Bye.

1051
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:07,124
Okay, we're off!

1052
01:47:12,125 --> 01:47:14,374
Mia, I'll read you a story.
Okay?

1053
01:47:14,542 --> 01:47:16,624
- Then you can take your nap.
- Yeah.

1054
01:47:16,792 --> 01:47:18,374
It's getting late.

1055
01:47:41,917 --> 01:47:43,499
Why is Martine leaving?

1056
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,333
Martine has a life in Paris, a job.

1057
01:47:48,792 --> 01:47:51,833
She just came for vacation.
It's too complicated to stay.

1058
01:47:52,167 --> 01:47:53,958
Don't you want her to stay?

1059
01:47:55,750 --> 01:47:57,833
Of course I'd like her to stay.

1060
01:48:00,375 --> 01:48:01,791
But it's complicated.

1061
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,041
Who knows if she'd like living here?

1062
01:48:06,209 --> 01:48:08,624
New York's great!
It's a great town!

1063
01:48:14,375 --> 01:48:15,916
It's complicated, you know.

1064
01:48:16,750 --> 01:48:18,083
You don't realize.

1065
01:48:18,250 --> 01:48:18,999
Daddy,

1066
01:48:19,875 --> 01:48:22,083
Jade was sad to be leaving.

1067
01:48:22,250 --> 01:48:24,499
Lucas was sad to be leaving, too.

1068
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:12,916
Martine!

1069
01:49:13,375 --> 01:49:14,374
Don't go!

1070
01:49:14,542 --> 01:49:15,916
- What?
- Don't go!

1071
01:49:16,084 --> 01:49:18,333
- What does that mean?
- Don't go!

1072
01:49:18,500 --> 01:49:20,666
My plane takes off in two hours.

1073
01:49:20,834 --> 01:49:22,291
The bus is about to leave.

1074
01:49:22,625 --> 01:49:24,499
Who cares? Stay!

1075
01:49:24,667 --> 01:49:26,666
The kids have school in two days.

1076
01:49:26,834 --> 01:49:28,708
We'll figure it out. Stay!

1077
01:49:30,584 --> 01:49:32,499
There is a spark. Stay.

1078
01:49:32,667 --> 01:49:34,791
Yeah, Mommy, stay!

1079
01:49:36,792 --> 01:49:39,291
But if I stay,
I'll have to find a job,

1080
01:49:39,459 --> 01:49:40,208
get a visa...

1081
01:49:40,375 --> 01:49:42,666
We will.
I'll find you an American.

1082
01:49:43,679 --> 01:49:44,600
We're staying here now.

1083
01:49:44,625 --> 01:49:46,583
It's our town!
We're not gonna budge.

1084
01:49:47,375 --> 01:49:48,833
We're gonna settle down.

1085
01:49:58,334 --> 01:49:59,583
That's disgusting.

1086
01:50:06,959 --> 01:50:08,083
So, did you read it?

1087
01:50:08,334 --> 01:50:09,041
Yeah.

1088
01:50:09,792 --> 01:50:12,374
- And?
- So happy days are here again?

1089
01:50:13,292 --> 01:50:14,791
Yeah. Is that a drag?

1090
01:50:16,250 --> 01:50:18,166
I have a problem
with the ending.

1091
01:50:18,334 --> 01:50:18,874
Why?

1092
01:50:19,542 --> 01:50:21,874
It's sort of the hideous
happy ending.

1093
01:50:22,042 --> 01:50:25,916
What does that mean? What do you
care if they end up happy?

1094
01:50:26,084 --> 01:50:27,166
Calm down!

1095
01:50:27,334 --> 01:50:28,208
I will not!

1096
01:50:28,375 --> 01:50:30,249
Who is this guy, to say such a...?

1097
01:50:30,417 --> 01:50:32,499
Calm down.

1098
01:50:32,667 --> 01:50:34,999
I know your spiel about tragedy.

1099
01:50:35,167 --> 01:50:37,916
It's true, most stories
do feed on misery.

1100
01:50:38,084 --> 01:50:40,208
But when you find happiness,

1101
01:50:40,709 --> 01:50:43,791
there's nothing more to say.
So it's time to stop.

1102
01:50:43,959 --> 01:50:48,249
Are you talking about in life
or in the novel?

1103
01:51:57,459 --> 01:51:58,999
What are you thinking about?

1104
01:52:08,125 --> 01:52:09,124
Life.
