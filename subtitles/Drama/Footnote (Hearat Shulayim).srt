1
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:09,068
The most difficult day
in the life of Professor Shkolnik.

2
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,075
I'm leaving.

3
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:18,953
You coming?

4
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:34,093
Professor Uriel Shkolnik,

5
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:38,347
Head, Mandel Institute of Jewish Studies
at Hebrew University, Jerusalem.

6
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:41,976
Max Kuper, professor for Jewish Thought,

7
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,103
full professor in the Talmud Department,

8
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:48,191
an internationally renowned scholar
of Talmudic and the Sages literature.

9
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,693
Among his prestigious awards,

10
00:01:50,778 --> 00:01:54,822
the Bialik Award, the Jerusalem Prize
for Rabbinic literature,

11
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:56,532
the Kaplan Prize and the Urbach Prize.

12
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:58,534
To the Israel Museum, please.

13
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:02,288
Professor Shkolnik is a member
of the American Academy

14
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,707
for Jewish research in New York.

15
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:11,506
His research is compiled in nine books
and dozens of papers, dealing in subjects

16
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:14,133
on marital laws in the Talmudic era,

17
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:16,719
law and ethics in the world of the Sages,

18
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:19,222
and memory and identity
in the Babylonian Diaspora.

19
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:25,478
Professor Shkolnik's scientific contributions
attest to daring thought and depth,

20
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:32,068
and to a new perspective on
Jewish culture and intellectual history.

21
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:37,824
For all these accomplishments,
the nominating committee has decided,

22
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:39,742
with the approval of the Council,

23
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:43,830
the President of the Academy,
and General Assembly,

24
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:50,253
to welcome Professor Shkolnik into
the National Israel Academy of Sciences.

25
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:03,683
Welcome, Professor Shkolnik.

26
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:06,519
We are proud to have you among us.

27
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:07,603
Thank you very much.

28
00:03:15,279 --> 00:03:18,030
Mr. President Shimon Peres,

29
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:22,118
President of the Academy,
Professor Yehuda Grossman,

30
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,829
fellow members of the Academy,

31
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:28,624
my father, Professor Eliezer Shkolnik,
with us tonight,

32
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,878
my mother, Dr. Judith Shkolnik.

33
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:36,549
Family, friends, esteemed guests.

34
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,218
Much have I learned,

35
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:43,848
yet I have but skimmed
from the knowledge of my teachers.

36
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:48,060
So I feel tonight, standing before you,

37
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:53,232
a little nervous, grateful, and mostly filled

38
00:03:53,317 --> 00:03:56,694
with appreciation for the people
I had the privilege to learn from.

39
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:02,033
I'd like to tell you a story.

40
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,912
When I was a child, maybe eight years old,

41
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:09,874
I came home from school
with a form to fill out.

42
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,836
Among the questions was,
"Father's profession."

43
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:16,505
I knew my father worked at the university,

44
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,176
busy there with the Talmud
and ancient books,

45
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,886
and that he was a professor.

46
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:26,015
But I didn't know
if that was considered a profession,

47
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:30,186
what they meant by "father's profession."

48
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,981
So I asked Father what to write.

49
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:38,527
He said, without hesitation, "Write 'teacher'!"

50
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:43,282
"You're not a teacher. I have teachers.

51
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:46,535
"You're not like them. You're a professor!"

52
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:50,206
My mother shouted to me,

53
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,584
"Write 'Talmud researcher,' or 'lecturer.'

54
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:57,964
"Sorry, put down 'Senior lecturer'!"

55
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:05,054
But my father forced me to write "teacher."

56
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:10,810
And asked to see the form,
as only a manuscript researcher knows,

57
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,146
to make sure I didn't make a mistake,

58
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:17,692
or leave space on the line
to add something after he'd gone.

59
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:23,072
I wrote down "teacher" in huge letters.

60
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,826
"That's my profession. Teacher," he said.

61
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:32,039
I was disappointed.

62
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,667
Ashamed.

63
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:40,589
What kid brags about his father, the teacher?

64
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:43,759
Lecturer, maybe, but teacher?

65
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:47,304
Several years have passed,

66
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:50,349
and today I know two things
I didn't know then.

67
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,934
One,

68
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:56,897
even a senior Talmud lecturer
at Hebrew University

69
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:59,900
is not something kids brag about at school.

70
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,571
Two, and seriously, this time.

71
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:06,198
If one really has to define our profession,

72
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:12,204
the nature of our craft,
the essence of this totality

73
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:15,875
that takes over every second
of our professional lives,

74
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:19,795
and, to tell the truth, our personal lives, too,

75
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,091
our aspirations, our social ties, our dreams...

76
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:28,888
We are teachers.
Those who impart knowledge to others.

77
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:33,309
Who take from the former generation
and pass on to the next.

78
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:35,144
That is our role.

79
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,689
So, thank you, Father, for this distinction,

80
00:06:38,774 --> 00:06:40,232
for the personal example,

81
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,818
for the way of life you set in our home,

82
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:46,489
for the cultural fortress you built around us.

83
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:50,409
When your grandchildren,
my children, ask me today

84
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:55,414
what my profession is,
I reply, with much pride,

85
00:06:56,458 --> 00:07:00,252
that l, like you, am a teacher.

86
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:06,509
Thank you very much.

87
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,995
It's nothing, just one lecture.

88
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:38,666
Dinner and a few meetings.

89
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:40,709
Other than that, I'm free.

90
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:42,878
No complaints.

91
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:49,552
I'll be in New York on February 6th.

92
00:07:50,637 --> 00:07:53,806
No, a fundraiser for the
Friends of the University.

93
00:07:58,895 --> 00:07:59,937
At the Pierre, of course.

94
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:02,648
You think Zilla
would come with me otherwise?

95
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,447
Listen, I'm at the Israel Museum

96
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:14,827
and I can't talk on the phone inside.

97
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:16,579
I need to get back.

98
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:21,417
No, nothing, a ceremony,
the Academy of Sciences...

99
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:22,960
Where to, sir?

100
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:26,297
-I was already inside.
-Where's inside?

101
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,508
At the ceremony.
I went out for a few minutes.

102
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:30,968
Lift your sleeve.

103
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,387
Why?

104
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,225
-What is your name?
-Eliezer Shkolnik.

105
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:39,602
And what ceremony is this?

106
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:43,105
Excuse me?

107
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,108
What ceremony is being held here?

108
00:08:46,568 --> 00:08:48,110
What's the problem?

109
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,905
There's no problem,
I just asked what ceremony.

110
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:53,574
What's the event taking place here?

111
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,576
-Don't you know?
-I do know.

112
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,536
So why are you asking me?

113
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,333
What did you say your name was?

114
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:07,755
-Sir?
-Explain the problem.

115
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,424
I was checked by security
at the main entrance...

116
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,928
Sir, I'm just doing my job.
No need to get angry.

117
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,679
Mister...

118
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:17,431
Professor Eliezer Shkolnik.

119
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,517
-Are you a member of the Academy?
-No.

120
00:09:21,144 --> 00:09:23,437
So what is your connection to the event?

121
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:30,778
Is everything all right?

122
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:32,988
-Do you know him?
-Of course!

123
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,617
-Is there a problem?
-No, sir. We're fine. Thank you.

124
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,495
-Are you sure?
-Yes. Thank you.

125
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,833
Okay, sir, you may go in. Please.

126
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,796
-Please, sir.
-No.

127
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,007
Finish your procedure.

128
00:09:52,634 --> 00:09:54,426
If you think I'm suspicious

129
00:09:54,511 --> 00:09:57,513
and that I shouldn't be here,
finish the procedure.

130
00:09:57,681 --> 00:10:00,683
Call one of your superiors.
I'll wait here patiently.

131
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,102
Call for some backup. Maybe a bomb squad?

132
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:05,562
Sir, don't get mad. It's not personal.

133
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,650
Anyone passing the main gate
should wear a wristband.

134
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:11,318
You don't have one.

135
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,862
So I just made an inquiry.

136
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,532
I'm sorry if I inconvenienced you.

137
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,245
Please, sir.

138
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:39,221
Now you're the ideologist.

139
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,182
You're not talking like a researcher.

140
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:46,603
Nonsense! Boyarin does that all day.

141
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:50,149
He is trying to derive
the anthropology from the hermeneutics.

142
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,901
You missed the point.

143
00:10:53,028 --> 00:10:56,071
The whole of Boyarin's corpus...

144
00:10:56,698 --> 00:11:01,660
Historically, the discourse
about gender and sexuality

145
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:03,287
is metaphoric.

146
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:07,249
What's the connection between
body technique and commentary practices?

147
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,710
It's like defeminizing the Jewish male.

148
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:12,671
It's an anti-colonialist argument!

149
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:14,715
What are you talking about?

150
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:20,346
Basically, he's trying to say
this man is a sissy

151
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,182
as opposed to the virile, strong Roman man

152
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:26,101
with his iron helmet and cleated boots.

153
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:31,690
He claims that Zionism
changed the Jewish man

154
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:34,943
from a feminine man to a macho man,

155
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:38,572
which means the destruction
of Jewish history...

156
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:44,244
Come closer together, please.

157
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:47,748
A bit more.

158
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,546
And, only if you wish, you may smile.

159
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:22,783
-Are you holding?
-I can manage.

160
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:37,339
Kids, do you have enough room?
Shall I move the seat?

161
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,091
We're fine, don't worry.

162
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,843
Dad, are you getting in?

163
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,803
I'll walk.

164
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:46,140
There's plenty of room.
Josh, make room for Grandpa.

165
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,183
I'd rather walk.

166
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,852
Seriously, you're not getting in?

167
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:53,397
I need to stretch my legs
after all this sitting. I'll walk.

168
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,065
-Got your keys?
-Yes.

169
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,110
Josh, shut the door.

170
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:06,285
Why isn't Grandpa a member
of the Academy of Sciences?

171
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:03,425
Eliezer.

172
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:08,138
Congratulations.

173
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:11,058
Your son is doing well.

174
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:47,821
A few things worth knowing
about Eliezer Shkolnik.

175
00:15:51,534 --> 00:15:52,784
1. His research.

176
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,411
Eliezer Shkolnik came up
with a revolutionary argument.

177
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:59,708
A version of the Jerusalem Talmud
circulated in Europe in the Middle Ages,

178
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,544
different from the version we have today.

179
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:06,715
He proposed this after discovering
small differences between

180
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:11,386
the version we have and the text
quoted by the Sages of the time.

181
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:16,475
Understand, this means hundreds,
thousands of books,

182
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:20,562
each having several versions of manuscripts.

183
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:24,566
Eliezer Shkolnik analyzed all of them,
for almost 30 years.

184
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:28,278
A huge undertaking ! With a lot of audacity.

185
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:33,784
Then, a month before he was about
to publish this monumental work,

186
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:35,577
his life's project,

187
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:38,413
another scholar,
Professor Yehuda Grossman,

188
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:43,877
by chance, found inside the bindings
of books at an Italian monastery,

189
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,089
the manuscript of that version
of the Jerusalem Talmud.

190
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:50,759
The original that was used
by the European Sages.

191
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:55,389
And so made all
of Shkolnik's work unnecessary.

192
00:16:55,973 --> 00:17:00,936
It actually proved Shkolnik's thesis,
but Grossman published it before him.

193
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:17,369
2. For 40 years, every day,

194
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,164
he walks

195
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:27,796
from his home to the National Library,
on a fixed route.

196
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:32,759
In any weather.

197
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:38,181
A momentary lapse
of concentration of the copyist,

198
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:41,393
whose eye skips from one word to another,

199
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:45,647
is called "homoeoteleuton."

200
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:50,736
3. He refused to cancel
his annual course,

201
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:58,076
even though only one student
signed up for it.

202
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:06,042
We can learn from this that hospitality
is more important than the Sabbath?

203
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,044
4. His favorite line is:

204
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:09,755
This is a very nice idea.

205
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:11,423
Very nice.

206
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:12,883
But wrong.

207
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,303
My father says
that this is what Lévinas says.

208
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,097
His second favorite line is:

209
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:20,182
Yes.

210
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:23,268
One cannot draw evidence from fools.

211
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,355
The truth is, in reality,

212
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,775
nothing is nice.

213
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:35,363
Professor Eliezer Shkolnik

214
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,699
5. For 16 consecutive years,

215
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:40,619
he was submitted as
a candidate for the Israel Prize.

216
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:53,173
In all these years,
others were found more worthy.

217
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:03,391
6. His life's pride is the footnote

218
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,270
dedicated to him by Y. N. Feinstein

219
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:11,024
in his monumental book.

220
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,819
Introduction to Text Versions
of Talmudic Literature

221
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:27,916
Brought to my attention by
my friend and student, E. Shkolnik.

222
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,224
-Didn't I tell you this story?
-No.

223
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,684
It was extreme.

224
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,061
He forced me to write "teacher."

225
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,605
Grabbed my hand
and crushed it onto the page.

226
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:56,528
It hurt for a week! Didn't I tell you?

227
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:59,781
Why wouldn't he let you write
"Talmudic lecturer" or "researcher"?

228
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:05,078
He resented a third grade teacher
asking about his profession.

229
00:20:05,288 --> 00:20:08,039
He's a philologist,
but who knows what that is?

230
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:11,251
In my mind, he was an important man,

231
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,337
a kind of world expert.

232
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:17,257
There were maybe four people in the world

233
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,968
who understood his work,
and when his research was finished,

234
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:23,221
the world would know
the great scholar he is.

235
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:27,309
But in the meantime
no one knew this but me.

236
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:31,980
I cried all the way to school.
I didn't submit the form.

237
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:35,358
That's the story you chose to tell?

238
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:37,652
I made him look good. Modest, no?

239
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:45,744
It's as if Josh would stand up
in front of all your friends

240
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:48,330
and tell them what a dedicated father you are

241
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:51,416
because you "encouraged" him
to do his SAT's at age 14.

242
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,335
I did encourage him.

243
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,170
You tortured him.

244
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,798
Otherwise he would've
ended up with nothing.

245
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,593
This way, he can choose to do nothing,
but he has a choice.

246
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,262
Whatever you say.

247
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:11,645
A few things worth knowing
about Uriel Shkolnik.

248
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:13,897
1.

249
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:16,608
On the night of Shavuot,
he manages to deliver 6 lectures

250
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,944
on various subjects
all over the city.

251
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,947
An interesting anecdote
about Gedaliahu Alon

252
00:21:22,031 --> 00:21:25,241
is that he changed his name to Alon,
because in Greek...

253
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:27,118
To what can we compare this?

254
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:30,205
I once heard a nice idea...

255
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:33,750
If we neutralize the classic
commentary of the text...

256
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:37,128
The deep core of the idea...

257
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:40,715
I'll jump to the end of the paragraph...

258
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:48,306
"May all seedlings coming
from you be like you."

259
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,475
2.

260
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,978
Let me tell you something
my father once told me.

261
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:54,062
Great Lecturer

262
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:58,400
There are many correct things in your paper,
and many new things.

263
00:21:58,776 --> 00:21:59,776
Challenging and fun

264
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:00,986
Thank you.

265
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,989
The problem is that the new things
are not correct.

266
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:06,908
And the correct things aren't new.

267
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:10,996
But that's not necessarily bad.

268
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:13,498
Perfect!

269
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:17,544
3. The birth of their younger daughter.

270
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:18,795
I love hearing you speak.

271
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:23,425
No matter the topic,
it always puts things in their place.

272
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:26,011
Things I had no opinion about

273
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:29,514
coming out of your mouth,
I immediately agree.

274
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:34,894
4.

275
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:38,231
In many ways, life in a couple is like a tree.

276
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:41,192
A few things people say
behind his back.

277
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:45,196
You're better off on his good side.

278
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,907
It's not that he'll persecute you,

279
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:51,036
but if you're not on the same page as him,

280
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:54,748
you'll soon find yourself
out of the department.

281
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:58,960
He expects a kind of constant, mild flattery.

282
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:01,046
Congratulations to the young couple.

283
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,798
A new home in Israel !

284
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,634
5.

285
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:17,812
Your father discovered something
very important today.

286
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,731
You can't disturb him now.

287
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,865
The moment he decided
to become a Talmud scholar.

288
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:36,331
The happiest day
in the life of Professor Shkolnik.

289
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:43,505
In memory of
Professor Menachem Stern.

290
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,507
Murdered here on his way
to the National Library.

291
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:06,986
Speaking.

292
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:12,534
Concerning?

293
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:46,776
Seriously? Publish it, like this?

294
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:49,028
You can't be stuck with it for 80 years.

295
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,739
Stay in motion all the time, or you fall !

296
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:57,245
Are you sure?

297
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:01,166
It means that Eldad and Meidad
are half-brothers to Moses. Radical !

298
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,750
I'm never sure.

299
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:06,546
Yes!

300
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:12,260
Good morning, sir. Please.

301
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,555
Please, sir. You can pass.

302
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,101
Someone took my bag and my clothes.

303
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:45,937
Didn't you leave them in the other room?

304
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:01,703
My bag was stolen and my clothes.

305
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:05,498
My wallet, my cell phone.

306
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,750
My watch, my glasses.

307
00:27:08,210 --> 00:27:10,295
Maybe someone moved them?

308
00:27:10,546 --> 00:27:12,922
Why would anyone move my clothes?

309
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:17,385
Shall I go talk to the guard?

310
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:20,263
No, no, it's okay.

311
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,730
Want to borrow my clothes, maybe?

312
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:47,332
Sarah, hi.

313
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,834
This is our lost and found.

314
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,378
Good morning.

315
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:43,030
It was like he was someone else,
sitting there. Not him.

316
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:44,907
And who is this woman?

317
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:47,660
Why in a remote park? Alone?

318
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:49,745
Scary!

319
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:51,933
...you home?

320
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:53,851
Eliezer!

321
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,453
I was looking for you.

322
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:15,957
-Did you eat lunch?
-Not yet.

323
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,960
Did something happen?

324
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:22,296
I had a call from
the Education Minister's office today.

325
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:27,426
They've decided to give me
the Israel Prize this year.

326
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:50,116
-I just heard. Congratulations!
-Thanks.

327
00:31:50,284 --> 00:31:52,535
-Better late than never.
-Incredible, isn't it?

328
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:54,996
Did you speak to him? Is he ecstatic?

329
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:57,915
My mother says he's in shock.

330
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,167
You're the one who seems in shock.

331
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:02,003
Can you believe it?

332
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:05,256
He'd given up.
He'd been passed up for 20 years.

333
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,509
The things he said about this prize!

334
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:11,095
For years he's been saying
all the laureates are unworthy.

335
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,431
One's a dilettante,
another, an historic accident,

336
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,224
the third, a folklorist.

337
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:18,644
His whole personality has to reboot now.

338
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:20,980
Who was on the committee?

339
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:24,400
It's strange.
I assume Grossman's the chairman.

340
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:26,527
Did he suddenly grow a heart?

341
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:29,322
Your father's a great man,
no need for a heart to get that.

342
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,282
Just common sense.

343
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:34,285
He's the most important researcher
of our generation.

344
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,369
Really.

345
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:37,455
He has the integrity
no longer found in the department.

346
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:39,040
Or elsewhere, for that matter.

347
00:32:48,842 --> 00:32:54,388
My grandmother fled and hid in the woods.

348
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:59,226
My grandfather stayed
with Franz Josef's soldiers.

349
00:32:59,311 --> 00:33:03,648
The war dragged on and they waited.

350
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:09,695
In the end, the Cossacks retreated.

351
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,750
-I'm really happy for him.
-I know.

352
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:24,460
He deserves it.

353
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:28,506
But he's so weird !

354
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,759
When I hugged him today,
I barely recognized him.

355
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:32,927
His smell...

356
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,846
It was the smell of a stranger.

357
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:40,142
I've no idea who this man is.

358
00:33:40,686 --> 00:33:42,061
And he's my father.

359
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,606
It was very moving to see him like this.

360
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:49,235
Like an anorexic girl
who suddenly begins to eat.

361
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:50,778
He deserves it.

362
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,578
But that image of him with that woman...

363
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,038
It's inconceivable!

364
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:03,374
Do you really think there's a woman?

365
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:06,168
I don't know. Anything's possible.

366
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,379
If he does, it's hilarious, no?

367
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:10,381
Where does he get the courage?

368
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:12,466
What's courage got to do with it?

369
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:17,847
It takes a lot of courage to risk everything
for a momentary passion.

370
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,099
Maybe it's not momentary?

371
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,977
Still. He has a lot to lose.

372
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:31,444
So that's why you don't cheat on me?
Too much to lose?

373
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:34,905
Who said I don't?

374
00:34:35,866 --> 00:34:37,158
You don't.

375
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,328
How can you be so sure?

376
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,789
You're a coward.

377
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,504
So my father is brave and I'm a coward.

378
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:55,176
Your father is true to himself
and is willing to pay the price.

379
00:34:55,886 --> 00:34:59,680
You're a nice guy
who's afraid of confrontation.

380
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:01,932
Even with me.

381
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,518
What are you saying?

382
00:35:04,895 --> 00:35:06,103
I don't understand.

383
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:09,190
You want me to confront you? I can do that.

384
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:12,109
No. I'm glad you don't want
to break up our family.

385
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:15,196
It's not out of fidelity, but out of fear.

386
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,866
I love you.

387
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,075
I really do.

388
00:35:21,203 --> 00:35:22,536
I know.

389
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,168
So, what's your diagnosis?

390
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,004
I don't know yet.

391
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,716
But if you'd like to get a nurse
to assist me in here,

392
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:37,134
I'm all for it.

393
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:42,389
MUTE

394
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:03,160
"...winners of the Israel Prize in Jewish
Sciences and Rabbinical Literature."

395
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:04,495
That will annoy him.

396
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:08,916
"Professor Shmuel Tarshish for his
achievements in the study of Aggadah,

397
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,001
"Professor Eliezer Shkolnik
for his contribution

398
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:13,045
"to the study of Talmud text versions."

399
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:24,515
-That's it?
-That's it.

400
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:29,270
They didn't quote the considerations?
Say who was on the committee?

401
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:11,729
Professor Eliezer Shkolnik
for his contribution

402
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:14,565
to the study of
Talmud text versions.

403
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:29,288
Miscellaneous

404
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:51,393
Footnote

405
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:53,729
-Yes, good morning.
-Professor Shkolnik?

406
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:55,940
-Uriel.
-Shoshi from National Radio.

407
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:58,400
It's about the item on the news.

408
00:37:58,735 --> 00:38:00,194
That's my father, not me.

409
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:03,364
I know, but you could explain his work,

410
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:06,533
congratulate him on the air,
if you like, but that's...

411
00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:10,287
Thank you, but I must ask you
to leave me out of it.

412
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,873
Call him, interview him.

413
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:15,626
He won't answer. Do you have his mobile?

414
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,963
No, sorry. I must get off the line. Sorry.

415
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:21,465
-Yes, good morning.
-Uriel?

416
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:24,009
-That's me.
-Yonah Salomon.

417
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,761
Yonah Salomon.

418
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:29,431
I'm the advisor to the
Education Minister for the Israel Prize.

419
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:32,768
Damn call waiting !
They're attacking my phone!

420
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:36,772
I'm sorry to disturb you,
but we must meet with you urgently.

421
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,023
Who's "we"?

422
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:41,485
Me and the supervisor of the Israel Prize.

423
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:42,861
I didn't hear you.

424
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:46,991
Can you come over in an hour?
This is not for the phone.

425
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,243
Now I'm curious!

426
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:50,911
At least tell me what this is about.

427
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:54,915
We'll explain everything.
I'll be in Sarah Fodor's room.

428
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:57,751
Just tell me everything's all right.
You're making me nervous.

429
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,421
It will be fine, but now it's a bit of a mess.

430
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:02,965
Yonah, come on, I'm not a child.

431
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:05,509
Did you find out my father's a serial killer?

432
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:09,013
Did he offend Ethiopians?
Someone's not happy with his winning?

433
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:10,889
Okay, so, he has enemies. So what?

434
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,516
Save your speculations.

435
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,768
See you in an hour? Okay?

436
00:39:16,104 --> 00:39:17,104
Okay.

437
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,698
Mother

438
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:28,782
Ignore

439
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:31,618
Thanks for the ride.

440
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:37,875
Wait, do you have food? Water?

441
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:38,959
Yes, yes.

442
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:40,210
A hat?

443
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,425
Will you be okay?

444
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,635
I'll be fine, don't worry.

445
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:51,764
-When will you be back?
-Thursday or Friday.

446
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,600
I'm not taking my cell phone,
so tell Mom not to worry.

447
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,504
Ministry of Education

448
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:37,601
Glad you could make it.

449
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,145
Can you bring a chair from the other room?

450
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,502
Okay, let's make quick introductions.

451
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:06,547
I'm Yonah, advisor to the Minister
for the Israel Prize.

452
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:09,299
Ms. Sarah Fodor,
head of the Israel Prize Division.

453
00:41:09,384 --> 00:41:12,219
Dvir Oded, legal advisor.

454
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,471
I assume you know the members
of the committee.

455
00:41:14,556 --> 00:41:17,474
-I do.
-Professor Yehuda Grossman, chairman,

456
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:19,017
Professor Adiel Glass,

457
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:21,270
and Professor Daniel Herman.

458
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:24,690
-Would you like a drink?
-No, thanks. I'm fine.

459
00:41:25,275 --> 00:41:26,775
So shall we begin?

460
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:31,780
You must be wondering why
we called you over on such short notice.

461
00:41:31,865 --> 00:41:34,700
I won't tell you what scenarios
went through my head.

462
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:37,119
I am sure you didn't imagine this one.

463
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,663
So, please, put me out of my misery.

464
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,040
Could we maybe close the door?

465
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:02,311
Thank you.

466
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:08,275
Basically, we have good news and bad news.

467
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,361
-Which would you like first?
-Could we quit playing games?

468
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:16,491
The bad news is that,
unfortunately, your father

469
00:42:16,826 --> 00:42:19,286
will not receive the Israel Prize this year.

470
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:21,997
Before you go on, I must stop you.

471
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:25,167
You should speak to my father, not to me.

472
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:27,753
If something
is getting in the way of this prize,

473
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:31,256
I'm not the one to discuss it with.

474
00:42:31,341 --> 00:42:35,636
This brings me to the good news.

475
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,721
There is no possible good news now.

476
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:40,974
You will be receiving
the Israel Prize this year.

477
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,311
Excuse me?

478
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:50,234
We're still trying to figure out
how this mistake happened,

479
00:42:50,318 --> 00:42:54,488
but it appears to have been the
assistant in the Minister's office.

480
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:57,407
She called your father instead of you,

481
00:42:57,492 --> 00:43:01,161
and the Minister congratulated him,
thinking she was talking to you.

482
00:43:02,664 --> 00:43:07,376
This has never happened to us,
so the legal advisor is here

483
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:11,421
to advise us how to proceed,
given this new situation.

484
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,257
From here on.

485
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,553
Let me get this straight.

486
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:22,057
You called my father by mistake?

487
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:26,687
The Minister has a conversation with him,
thinking she's talking to me?

488
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,313
According to our investigation,
that's what happened.

489
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:34,236
I have never heard anything so idiotic!

490
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:37,656
The consequences are terrible.
You realize that?

491
00:43:37,824 --> 00:43:43,662
That's why we wanted to talk to you
about the best course of action from here on.

492
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:48,625
I don't understand how they
confused our phone numbers,

493
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:52,546
and didn't make sure before
they put the Minister on the line.

494
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:55,882
The assistant claims
she first called the university

495
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:58,093
and asked to speak to Professor Shkolnik.

496
00:43:58,261 --> 00:44:01,346
She can't remember
if she mentioned a first name.

497
00:44:01,431 --> 00:44:04,016
Since you weren't there,
she asked for your cell number

498
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,393
and dialed the number she was given.

499
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:09,938
Both your first names
start with the same letter.

500
00:44:10,023 --> 00:44:12,107
Theoretically, this mistake
is understandable.

501
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:14,026
It's never happened before.

502
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:16,611
What about the press release?
Don't you send a letter?

503
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:19,364
The letter was mailed to you,
not to your father.

504
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:21,616
You should receive it today.

505
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,577
We did not send out a press release.

506
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:25,454
There was an announcement in the paper.

507
00:44:25,538 --> 00:44:28,832
The reporter must have heard about it.

508
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:32,085
We're still trying to figure out
how the reporter got the information.

509
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:36,381
Anyone can see that
this is not our usual phrasing.

510
00:44:49,354 --> 00:44:50,937
I...

511
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:56,401
I need a moment to think. Excuse me.

512
00:44:56,486 --> 00:44:57,986
-I'm sorry.
-Professor Shkolnik.

513
00:44:58,071 --> 00:45:01,198
What happened here is a disaster.
You have no idea.

514
00:45:01,282 --> 00:45:05,702
Professor Shkolnik, I must ask you
not to mention this to anyone.

515
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,580
It would be best
to keep discussing this here.

516
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:11,124
Give him a moment to calm down outside.

517
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,001
You won't call anyone, will you?

518
00:45:59,632 --> 00:46:01,925
I don't know how to react to this mistake

519
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,678
other than say it's too late to turn back.

520
00:46:04,846 --> 00:46:06,763
You told my father
he's the recipient of the prize.

521
00:46:06,848 --> 00:46:08,056
You can't take it back.

522
00:46:08,683 --> 00:46:12,436
How did I become a candidate?

523
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:16,273
In principle, I asked anyone
concerned not to recommend me

524
00:46:16,357 --> 00:46:17,691
as long as my father is a candidate.

525
00:46:17,859 --> 00:46:21,194
And he's been a candidate
for quite some years, I know it,

526
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:23,530
because I'm the one
who makes sure to submit him every time.

527
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:26,199
I recommended you.

528
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:31,413
According to the regulations,
the judges may add candidates.

529
00:46:31,831 --> 00:46:34,541
And I recommended you.

530
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:42,591
At the meeting, each of us
wrote down the name he preferred

531
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,302
from the list of candidates.

532
00:46:45,386 --> 00:46:49,890
And everyone, unanimously, chose you.

533
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:55,896
Everyone thinks the prize
should go to you this year.

534
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:03,570
What a mess!

535
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:10,035
I'd like, if you please,

536
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:12,579
to focus on the legal aspects.

537
00:47:13,748 --> 00:47:15,540
There is no way to switch the winner.

538
00:47:17,126 --> 00:47:20,170
The point on which
we wished to consult with you

539
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:23,965
is the best way to break
the news to your father.

540
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:27,886
The legal aspects are all very well,

541
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:29,638
but we're talking about life and death.

542
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:32,182
My father has been passed over for 20 years!

543
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:34,392
Finally, when he thinks
he's getting the prize...

544
00:47:34,477 --> 00:47:36,436
You can't take it away from him. It'll kill him.

545
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,355
I'm not joking here. It will kill him.

546
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:41,274
And he deserves it, damn it!

547
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:43,151
-Someone other than me has to say it.
-Enough !

548
00:47:48,241 --> 00:47:50,742
This mistake shouldn't have happened,

549
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:54,788
but once it did,
it must be made right, not made worse.

550
00:47:56,290 --> 00:48:01,044
We're not discussing whether Eliezer
Shkolnik is worthy of the Israel Prize.

551
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:03,338
So, as chairman, what do you propose?

552
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:08,009
The Minister should invite
Eliezer Shkolnik, today,

553
00:48:08,678 --> 00:48:11,137
to apologize for the mistake.

554
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:15,392
And to congratulate him upon
his son receiving the prize.

555
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:16,726
Pure and simple.

556
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:19,020
Can you really see that happening?

557
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:22,065
My father, arriving at the Minister's office,

558
00:48:22,984 --> 00:48:24,734
without knowing why,

559
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:28,405
only to be told that they're
taking the prize away from him?

560
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:30,448
And what's more,
that they're giving it to his son?

561
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:32,784
I don't see it,

562
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:34,327
because it won't happen.
I won't let it happen !

563
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:35,787
I'm declaring right now.

564
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:39,374
If the recipient's identity is changed,
I'll resign as chairman.

565
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:43,420
One moment, Professor Grossman.
No need for ultimatums.

566
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:46,923
Let's think about it with an open mind.
Perhaps it's not such a bad solution.

567
00:48:47,008 --> 00:48:48,675
Eliezer Shkolnik
has been a candidate for years.

568
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:52,012
If Uriel will give up the prize,
why not consider giving it to his father?

569
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:55,682
No, you'd be exposing
the Ministry to a massive lawsuit.

570
00:48:56,225 --> 00:48:59,394
If this ever comes out...
Don't even think in that direction.

571
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:01,771
Why would it come out?
Whoever knows is in this room.

572
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:06,192
We'll inform the Minister, but it's in
our interests to keep it to ourselves.

573
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:07,611
It's not just a convenient solution.

574
00:49:07,695 --> 00:49:10,572
It's the right thing to do, in every sense.

575
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,824
It's correcting a 20-year injustice.

576
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:15,243
Absolutely not!

577
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:20,749
Eliezer Shkolnik will not receive
the Israel Prize on my watch.

578
00:49:21,042 --> 00:49:23,460
I won't sign the judges' considerations.

579
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:28,965
Uriel, I'm sorry.
You know I appreciate your work.

580
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:31,718
That is why I gave you the Prize.

581
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:35,013
To you ! Not to the entire Shkolnik family.

582
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:39,476
You have no right
to pass this honor on to your father.

583
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,186
Any discussion of this is absurd.

584
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:47,233
Look, the three of you have
already won the Israel Prize.

585
00:49:48,277 --> 00:49:52,530
You know what it's like, that feeling,
on the day you're told that you've won.

586
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:59,245
Especially if this is someone who,
for years, felt ostracized and outcast.

587
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:02,791
And then, all at once,
the gates of the establishment open to him,

588
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:04,709
and he's told, "Welcome!

589
00:50:04,794 --> 00:50:08,588
"You're accepted and appreciated."

590
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:13,760
To take away the existential bliss
that was given to him yesterday,

591
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,512
it's bloodshed !

592
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:20,725
If we were to bestow the Israel Prize
out of compassion or pity,

593
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:23,228
the entire Israel Prize institution
would look different.

594
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:28,191
We are committed to a single,
high and uncompromising standard.

595
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:32,987
So tell me why my father
doesn't deserve the Israel Prize?

596
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:35,907
Compared to others. Seriously, why not?

597
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:38,868
How is he inferior to Hecht,
or Goldberg, or Sheperman?

598
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:41,287
Notice I'm not mentioning anyone here.

599
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,958
I'm willing to argue why others are worthy.

600
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:50,296
But I refuse to list the shortcomings
I find in your father's research.

601
00:50:51,132 --> 00:50:52,507
Naturally!

602
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,635
Because in the end,
this enables you to hide the fact

603
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:59,889
that the grudge you hold against
him is personal, not professional.

604
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:02,267
I don't know what you're implying.

605
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:04,602
But, in any case,
it isn't relevant to this discussion.

606
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:06,896
Not implying. Saying explicitly!

607
00:51:07,106 --> 00:51:09,149
I think you hate my father.

608
00:51:09,525 --> 00:51:12,527
For years,
you've been preventing his promotion,

609
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:14,738
hiding manuscripts from him,

610
00:51:15,156 --> 00:51:18,241
blocking him at appointment committees.

611
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:21,619
His closeness to Feinstein made
you crazy when you were young,

612
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:25,331
and, to this day, it distorts your judgment!

613
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:29,335
You could have given him
the Jerusalem manuscript you found.

614
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:32,172
For 30 years he worked on it. It's his.

615
00:51:32,381 --> 00:51:36,134
It's his! It's his life's work. His whole world.
Everyone knew it. Everyone!

616
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:39,304
But you had to publish it before him !

617
00:51:39,388 --> 00:51:42,348
Why?

618
00:51:43,184 --> 00:51:46,936
You should've disqualified yourself
when you knew he was a candidate.

619
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:50,982
Everyone here knows this!
Anyone with a hint of basic decency!

620
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:54,819
My response to these grave allegations

621
00:51:54,904 --> 00:51:57,071
I'm forced to keep to myself.

622
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:04,704
What I can reveal about your father,
no son should hear.

623
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:07,957
Which is why I ask you,

624
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:12,045
stop pushing me
and leave things as they are.

625
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:18,134
But you don't deny the long,
deep rivalry between you and my father?

626
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:21,471
Why didn't you disqualify yourself?

627
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:23,723
Come to think of it,

628
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:27,268
I suspect you voted for me just to spite him.

629
00:52:27,603 --> 00:52:29,938
You knew it'd hurt him
to see me receive the prize

630
00:52:30,022 --> 00:52:32,607
while he's a candidate. You knew that!

631
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:36,820
I wish to end this meeting.

632
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:39,697
Either my opinion is accepted,

633
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:43,576
and the Minister tells Eliezer Shkolnik
there's been a mistake,

634
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:46,412
or I resign from this committee.

635
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:50,375
And the reason for my resignation
will inevitably come out.

636
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:54,170
Things must be handled with transparency.

637
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:57,257
Same transparency with which
you run the Mishna Project?

638
00:52:57,424 --> 00:53:00,510
A project that allows you to decide
who has access to manuscripts,

639
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,720
and who doesn't?

640
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:05,974
Or when you blocked the promotion
of one of the people present here,

641
00:53:06,058 --> 00:53:08,059
and we all know who,

642
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:12,480
because you were afraid he'd disprove
your thesis about the Scrolls?

643
00:53:12,565 --> 00:53:16,901
Or the transparency with which you
rejected Ariella Asher's PhD thesis

644
00:53:16,986 --> 00:53:20,238
when she was on her deathbed,
a month before she died,

645
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:23,366
while her family begged you to approve it!

646
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:27,787
Twelve years of work, and you,
with inconceivable cruelty,

647
00:53:27,872 --> 00:53:31,499
refused just because her advisor
happened to be my father?

648
00:53:31,667 --> 00:53:33,793
So let's talk about transparency,
Professor Grossman !

649
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:35,879
I can talk to journalists, too.

650
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:40,717
I would think you'd be the first here
with an interest to lay low.

651
00:53:40,801 --> 00:53:43,303
-Let me out!
-This meeting is not over!

652
00:53:43,888 --> 00:53:46,639
Your father's only achievement,
the only one,

653
00:53:46,724 --> 00:53:48,558
is the footnote that Feinstein gave him !

654
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:52,312
Other than that,
he never published anything of value.

655
00:53:53,105 --> 00:53:56,232
Do you know why Feinstein
gave him that citation?

656
00:53:56,317 --> 00:53:59,819
Because he knew your father
was no threat to him.

657
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:01,613
He had such disdain for him

658
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:04,616
that he was willing to share
this empty credit with him.

659
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:06,618
He knew how much your father needed it.

660
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:09,203
That's no reason to get the Israel Prize.

661
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:12,332
Now, move away from the door, please.

662
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:16,419
I said move away from the door!

663
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,838
Back off, you psychopath bastard !

664
00:54:35,022 --> 00:54:37,732
I want the record of this meeting.

665
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,069
You know
there is no record in our meetings.

666
00:54:41,695 --> 00:54:43,696
I'm sorry I pushed you.

667
00:54:44,031 --> 00:54:45,949
I shouldn't have pushed you.

668
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,450
Let's all calm down.

669
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:49,702
Are you okay, Professor Grossman?

670
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:53,665
Let's put things back into proportion.

671
00:54:53,874 --> 00:54:57,585
No, these are the proportions.

672
00:54:58,879 --> 00:55:00,797
These are the proportions.

673
00:55:16,939 --> 00:55:19,190
Give me a few hours.

674
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:21,484
I'll tell my father.

675
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:39,479
Who is it?

676
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:42,565
It's Uriel Shkolnik. Is my father there?

677
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:43,983
Yes, come in.

678
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,978
Uriel, here.

679
00:57:21,063 --> 00:57:24,482
Would you like to say a few words
in honor of your father's prize?

680
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:31,215
Did you talk to Josh?

681
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:34,927
When is he coming back?

682
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:37,388
I don't know. Tomorrow, or the day after.

683
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:40,141
-Tomorrow, or the day after?
-I said I didn't know.

684
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:48,357
Sorry.

685
00:58:49,443 --> 00:58:50,776
Talk to him.

686
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:53,070
You got registered mail.

687
00:59:06,418 --> 00:59:08,002
I can't do it.

688
00:59:09,463 --> 00:59:10,963
I just can't.

689
00:59:11,632 --> 00:59:14,967
Ever since I got my tenure,
he stopped being happy for me.

690
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:17,136
Every achievement of mine is at his expense.

691
00:59:17,304 --> 00:59:18,763
And I know he blames me.

692
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:23,476
I'm the one who spoils this world
that was supposed to be his.

693
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:26,103
He'll survive this blow,

694
00:59:26,605 --> 00:59:28,898
perhaps even revel in it.

695
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:32,151
It'll be proof that everyone
but he is an amateur.

696
00:59:32,236 --> 00:59:33,736
But he'll hate me.

697
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,988
If I tell him about this mistake,

698
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:39,408
it will bury my relationship with him forever.

699
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:47,083
Uriel, there is no greater betrayal
of your father and his principles

700
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:48,960
than what you are asking of me.

701
00:59:50,254 --> 00:59:52,797
In spite of all my criticism of him,

702
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:57,677
your father never validated a mistake
because it was convenient.

703
00:59:58,345 --> 00:59:59,637
You know that.

704
00:59:59,805 --> 01:00:01,055
Yes, but he won't.

705
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,975
-We will.
-So what?

706
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:05,268
"So what?"

707
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:08,354
It turns the whole system into a circus.

708
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:09,438
No!

709
01:00:09,523 --> 01:00:12,233
It means that there are things
more important than the truth.

710
01:00:12,484 --> 01:00:13,609
Like what?

711
01:00:13,694 --> 01:00:14,735
Family?

712
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:20,741
Like your father, I do know
something about cutting corners,

713
01:00:20,826 --> 01:00:22,285
about abandoning the truth.

714
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:24,078
Enough with this truth !

715
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:27,498
So much aggression and violence
you hide under the word "truth."

716
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:29,000
I don't believe in this romanticism.

717
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:32,128
You don't seek the truth. You seek honors,

718
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:34,255
just like other mortals.

719
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:38,968
Such a terrible thing you're doing
in the name of truth.

720
01:00:39,303 --> 01:00:41,053
It's just a prize.

721
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:43,723
A prize, that's all.

722
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:46,058
It's not a betrayal of anything.

723
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:49,353
It's just a small, nice thing

724
01:00:49,438 --> 01:00:54,066
you can do for a colleague,
if only you'd be a little flexible.

725
01:00:55,027 --> 01:00:56,235
Just a tiny bit.

726
01:00:57,112 --> 01:00:59,697
That's all I ask of you. That's all.

727
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:20,468
I'll agree on two conditions.

728
01:01:21,428 --> 01:01:24,722
The first is that you write
the judges' considerations.

729
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:28,476
I'll sign them, but you write them.

730
01:01:31,605 --> 01:01:35,232
The second condition
is that you never submit

731
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:37,151
your candidacy for the Israel Prize.

732
01:01:39,905 --> 01:01:42,782
And make sure no one else does it for you.

733
01:01:44,284 --> 01:01:47,995
Not now, and not after my death
and your father's death.

734
01:01:49,456 --> 01:01:52,249
Uriel, I gave you the Israel Prize.

735
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:55,127
As far as I'm concerned, it's yours.

736
01:01:55,295 --> 01:01:58,255
If you choose to pass it on,
for family reasons,

737
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:00,508
I won't prevent you from doing that.

738
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:04,136
But if that's your decision, it's final.

739
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:08,140
Even if just you and I know about it.

740
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:17,108
The revenge of Professor Shkolnik.

741
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:22,655
-Hello.
-Hello.

742
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:25,950
-You must be the journalist?
-Yes, I'm Noa. Pleased to meet you.

743
01:02:26,034 --> 01:02:28,160
-Come on in.
-Thank you.

744
01:02:29,830 --> 01:02:32,039
I'm a little early.

745
01:02:32,499 --> 01:02:34,417
Eliezer likes punctuality.

746
01:02:34,501 --> 01:02:36,001
It's lovely here!

747
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:38,671
When I studied at Hebrew University,
I wanted to live around here.

748
01:02:38,797 --> 01:02:41,006
-You studied at Hebrew University?
-Yes.

749
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:44,218
-Which department?
-Philosophy and Art History.

750
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:46,929
You didn't take any of Eliezer's classes?

751
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:48,180
I'm afraid not.

752
01:02:48,348 --> 01:02:50,266
But I attended some of your son's lectures.

753
01:02:50,434 --> 01:02:52,351
Yes? How nice.

754
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:58,607
I wanted to ask you if you have any pictures
of Professor Shkolnik for the article.

755
01:02:58,692 --> 01:03:02,027
Maybe pictures of him
with your son, Professor Uriel Shkolnik?

756
01:03:02,446 --> 01:03:04,738
-All right.
-Hello.

757
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:07,533
I'll look. Excuse me.

758
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:10,411
Very pleased. I'm Noa.

759
01:03:15,167 --> 01:03:16,959
Would you prefer to sit at a table?

760
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:20,254
No, this is fine, thank you.
Wherever you prefer.

761
01:03:23,341 --> 01:03:25,801
Is it okay if I record our conversation?

762
01:03:36,396 --> 01:03:37,730
Shall we start?

763
01:03:42,903 --> 01:03:46,864
Can you tell me your life story,
just in an outline?

764
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:49,200
Born, raised, studied?

765
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:02,505
I was born in Jerusalem.

766
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:07,718
My parents came to Israel in 1932.

767
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:11,388
My father was a hat merchant.

768
01:04:15,727 --> 01:04:17,603
What do you mean by outline?

769
01:04:28,657 --> 01:04:31,325
Judges' Considerations

770
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:35,037
Let's start over.

771
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:37,957
Could you tell me
a little about your research?

772
01:04:55,517 --> 01:04:59,687
"Professor Eliezer Shkolnik.

773
01:04:59,980 --> 01:05:01,313

01:05:33,096 --> 01:05:36,640
My research focuses on mapping
the branches of Talmud text versions.

780
01:05:42,022 --> 01:05:45,566
Mapping the text versions
of the Talmud in Israel.

781
01:05:46,026 --> 01:05:47,901
The Jerusalem Talmud,

782

whose printed version,
which is studied nowadays,

783
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:53,532
is extremely problematic,
philologically speaking.

Introduction to the Text Version of the

792
01:06:22,646 --> 01:06:28,400

01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:42,081
"His few publications in various fields...

795
01:06:55,428 --> 01:07:01,767
"May be described as sifted flour.

796
01:07:02,310 --> 01:07:06,480
"A little that holds a lot."

797
01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:13,779
From talking with your colleagues,

798
01:07:14,114 --> 01:07:19,243
I understand that in the last few years,
you were quite critical

799
01:07:19,411 --> 01:07:22,079
of the manner in which the
Israel Prizes were bestowed.

800
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:32,214
"His great proficiency in Talmudic
Literature and his creativity..."

801
01:07:36,302 --> 01:07:41,640
"His impressive thoroughness in research..."

802
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:48,272
I believe the Israel Prize has lost
much of its prestige in recent years.

803
01:07:49,107 --> 01:07:53,152
When things got mixed up
and the prize in Jewish Sciences

804
01:07:53,278 --> 01:07:57,322
started going to people who deal
with rabbinical literature, folklore...

805
01:07:57,407 --> 01:07:59,241
So you're saying...

806
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:01,285
-What?
-Excuse me. Please continue.

807
01:08:01,369 --> 01:08:05,914
The recent recipients
are not researchers in the scientific sense.

808
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:09,501
Studies on rattles in the Talmudic era,

809
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:12,337
or musings about the marital life
of one sage or another,

810
01:08:12,422 --> 01:08:15,674
or cookie recipes
in the Babylonian Diaspora,

811
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:18,427
do not offer a scientific contribution

812
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:21,263
and do not honor
the institution of the Israel Prize.

813
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:26,435
I'm in an uncomfortable position,
as they decided to grant me this prize,

814
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:29,354
but, in all modesty,

815
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:32,691
I hope this choice means a return
to the days when they appreciated

816
01:08:32,776 --> 01:08:34,902
deep, thorough research, whose contribution

817
01:08:34,986 --> 01:08:38,113
isn't necessarily measured
in terms of popular opinion.

818
01:08:38,865 --> 01:08:42,701
Your son wrote a book about marital
relations during the Talmudic era.

819
01:08:46,748 --> 01:08:48,624
Uriel wrote many books.

820
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:56,089
"The greatness and uniqueness
of Professor Shkolnik..."

821
01:09:02,722 --> 01:09:07,601
How is it that two people in one
family chose such a narrow field?

822
01:09:19,197 --> 01:09:21,406
Greatness

823
01:09:32,836 --> 01:09:36,797
"Professor Shkolnik's fortress

824
01:09:37,215 --> 01:09:41,927
"is deployed over all branches
of Talmudic literature

825
01:09:42,095 --> 01:09:46,390
"and its parallels in the
contemporaneous culture."

826
01:09:46,516 --> 01:09:48,976
Is there competition between father and son?

827
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:52,229
To quote the Babylonian Talmud,

828
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:56,066
"A man can be jealous of anyone
except his son and pupil."

829
01:09:56,234 --> 01:09:57,860
I got the impression
that you and he represent

830
01:09:57,944 --> 01:10:00,070
almost opposite schools of research.

831
01:10:01,739 --> 01:10:03,657
Who gave you this impression?

832
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:05,659
I spoke to people,

833
01:10:05,994 --> 01:10:08,203
and I read your son's book.

834
01:10:09,122 --> 01:10:11,290
I'll illustrate it for you.

835
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:14,293
Say we both deal with potsherds.

836
01:10:14,544 --> 01:10:16,545
Yes? Broken pottery?

837
01:10:17,589 --> 01:10:20,299
One of us examines these potsherds,

838
01:10:20,383 --> 01:10:22,718
cleans them meticulously,

839
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:24,928
catalogs them,

840
01:10:25,013 --> 01:10:27,806
measures them scientifically and precisely,

841
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:31,351
tries to decipher which period
they're from, and who made them.

842
01:10:31,519 --> 01:10:35,022
And if he succeeds,
he has done his work properly,

843
01:10:35,273 --> 01:10:37,900
and it has scientific value for generations.

844
01:10:39,611 --> 01:10:42,821
The other looks at the potsherds
for a few seconds,

845
01:10:42,989 --> 01:10:44,990
sees they're more or less the same color,

846
01:10:45,158 --> 01:10:48,035
and immediately makes a pot out of them.

847
01:10:48,328 --> 01:10:51,204
The potsherds may be from different periods,

848
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:54,917
they may not exactly match,
main thing is, he has a pot!

849
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:58,128
The pot is very nice, very attractive,

850
01:10:58,212 --> 01:11:01,214
but it has nothing to do with scientific truth.

851
01:11:01,299 --> 01:11:05,552
It is an empty vessel. An illusion.
A tower with no foundation.

852
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:10,557
Sounds like this pot really annoys you.

853
01:11:10,725 --> 01:11:13,769
There is no pot! That's the point! It's fiction.

854
01:11:13,853 --> 01:11:16,688
You can't be annoyed with
something that doesn't exist.

855
01:11:17,190 --> 01:11:18,231
Fiction

856
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:24,655
Is this conflict present in your family life?

857
01:11:30,036 --> 01:11:32,371
Uriel excels in what he does.

858
01:11:33,373 --> 01:11:36,208
But I wouldn't call it Talmudic research.

859
01:11:43,091 --> 01:11:45,801
"His work embodies
a research infrastructure,

860
01:11:45,885 --> 01:11:48,428
"for those who work in Talmud research.

861
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:52,975
"For these reasons,
the Committee finds Professor Shkolnik,

862
01:11:53,059 --> 01:11:54,851
"worthy of receiving the Israel Prize."

863
01:12:14,914 --> 01:12:16,748
Did you hear the conversation?

864
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:19,918
Bits and pieces, not everything.

865
01:12:21,421 --> 01:12:22,713
Was I clear enough?

866
01:12:23,256 --> 01:12:26,299
I think so. I didn't hear everything.

867
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:30,929
I hope she's accurate.
She's a complete ignoramus.

868
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:30,822
On his son: "Nothing to do
with scientific truth.

869
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:32,240
"Empty Vessel. An illusion.
No Foundations."

870
01:13:32,325 --> 01:13:34,493
Highbrow Soap Opera

871
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:38,705
Young and Charlatan

872
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:43,627
Empty Vessel

873

Judges' Considerations

874
01:14:24,794 --> 01:14:27,587
Re: Israel Prize

875
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:06,543
Did you check the version
in the Oxford manuscript?

876
01:15:06,627 --> 01:15:07,627
No.

877
01:15:08,171 --> 01:15:11,173
-The article by Izhak Baer on the subject?
-No.

878
01:15:11,257 --> 01:15:13,175
-Menahem Ben-Sasson?
-No.

879
01:15:13,259 --> 01:15:14,759
Reuven Bonfil?

880
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:16,261
Salo Baron?

881
01:15:16,429 --> 01:15:19,639
These are just the scholars relevant
to your thesis starting with "B."

882
01:15:21,767 --> 01:15:28,440
Look, I've read some good papers
in my life, and I've read...

883
01:16:28,209 --> 01:16:32,170
Measuring potsherds all your life,
with nothing to show for it.

884
01:16:32,338 --> 01:16:33,505
That's science?

885
01:16:34,173 --> 01:16:35,674
It's masturbation !

886
01:16:55,361 --> 01:16:57,946
What are you doing?

887
01:16:58,781 --> 01:16:59,990
Nothing.

888
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:07,622
What are you planning to do?

889
01:17:08,082 --> 01:17:09,124
When?

890
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:12,585
Say, tomorrow morning?
Next week? In three years?

891
01:17:12,670 --> 01:17:14,504
Any plans on the horizon?

892
01:17:21,554 --> 01:17:24,055
I'm so close to giving up on you.

893
01:17:25,349 --> 01:17:28,893
You know what it means
when a father gives up on his son?

894
01:17:29,395 --> 01:17:31,604
I'm asking you, do you understand?

895
01:17:33,607 --> 01:17:35,233
So let me explain it.

896
01:17:39,947 --> 01:17:44,159
You're a millimeter from the point
where your life's course

897
01:17:44,243 --> 01:17:46,286
becomes irreversible.

898
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:49,998
Giving up on you means
that instead of wanting

899
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:51,666
to help you before it's too late,

900
01:17:52,793 --> 01:17:56,838
I want to see you suffer so that I can gloat.

901
01:17:59,383 --> 01:18:00,925
That's what it means.

902
01:18:27,828 --> 01:18:31,373
You have a problem with your autistic
father, go yell at him, not at Josh !

903
01:18:31,457 --> 01:18:35,210
I told you to talk to him,
not smash his head in with a bat.

904
01:18:36,337 --> 01:18:37,837
You have one role in this house,

905
01:18:37,922 --> 01:18:39,130
to be a mother.

906
01:18:39,215 --> 01:18:40,590
You dump that on me, too?

907
01:19:46,365 --> 01:19:50,785
It seems today I'm not just
the driver, but also the horse.

908
01:19:56,917 --> 01:19:58,793
How is it so far?

909
01:20:01,714 --> 01:20:03,798
Did you get reactions to the article?

910
01:20:04,091 --> 01:20:05,425
Some.

911
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:08,636
I don't think it interested that many people.

912
01:20:08,721 --> 01:20:12,557
Also, they put it way in the back pages, so...

913
01:20:16,937 --> 01:20:18,396
Talk to him.

914
01:20:18,481 --> 01:20:19,731
Really?

915
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:23,568
-Give him a chance to apologize.
-Has he ever apologized?

916
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:26,279
I don't need his apology.
I don't give a damn.

917
01:21:00,314 --> 01:21:04,609
Fiddler on the Roof

918
01:21:06,529 --> 01:21:10,281
Nice dowry you gave my daughter,
Tzeitel, on her wedding day.

919
01:21:10,407 --> 01:21:14,327
Was that really necessary?

920
01:21:15,788 --> 01:21:17,497
Never mind.

921
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:22,210
Anyway, Motel and Tzeitel
have been married two months...

922
01:21:22,461 --> 01:21:24,963
Change places with me for a moment.

923
01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:29,842
They're so happy, they have no idea
how bad they have it.

924
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:47,402
The Israel Prize was supposed
to go to me this year, not to Dad.

925
01:21:47,695 --> 01:21:51,573
Because of an assistant's mistake,
they announced it to him.

926
01:21:51,782 --> 01:21:55,994
When it was discovered,
I gave up the prize for him.

927
01:21:56,704 --> 01:21:59,497
No one knows, besides you.

928
01:21:59,582 --> 01:22:01,124
Not even Dikla.

929
01:22:24,231 --> 01:22:27,483
Tradition, tradition...

930
01:23:14,865 --> 01:23:16,240
Yes?

931
01:23:59,952 --> 01:24:02,453
Professor Shkolnik's fortress.

932
01:24:21,223 --> 01:24:24,517
This is your first interview
on television, right?

933
01:24:27,146 --> 01:24:31,149
You shouldn't be wearing a white shirt.
Remember that, for the next time.

934
01:24:31,358 --> 01:24:34,736
Maybe, if you had a jacket,
but white just won't do.

935
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:36,320
It's too bright.

936
01:24:40,367 --> 01:24:41,993
Try this on,

937
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:46,581
"Professor Eliezer Shkolnik,
star student of the great Talmud scholar,

01:25:35,881 --> 01:25:37,799
It's an introduction to a scientific edition.

954
01:25:37,883 --> 01:25:40,551
Did you hear, Yoav? Add "introduction."

955
01:25:42,888 --> 01:25:44,222
Say something.

956
01:25:45,224 --> 01:25:46,349
What should l say?

957
01:25:46,433 --> 01:25:48,976
-Count to 10.
-Delete it.

958
01:25:49,645 --> 01:25:52,230
"To which he has dedicated his life."

959
01:25:52,356 --> 01:25:56,609
One, two, three...

960
01:25:57,486 --> 01:25:59,821
Keep going. Louder.

961
01:25:59,905 --> 01:26:01,364
Four...

962
01:26:01,448 --> 01:26:02,740
-Louder.
-Four.

963
01:26:03,242 --> 01:26:04,992
-Louder please.
-Five.

964
01:26:06,578 --> 01:26:08,287
Six.

965
01:26:16,797 --> 01:26:18,548
Professor Shkolnik.

966
01:26:18,632 --> 01:26:21,175
Professor Shkolnik,
where are you going? Wait.

967
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:23,010
Professor Shkolnik!

968

The Fortress of Professor Herman
is deployed

981
01:28:56,206 --> 01:28:58,416
So, thank you, for this distinction,

982
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:00,167
for the personal example you set,

983
01:29:00,252 --> 01:29:03,170
for the way of life in our home,

984
01:29:03,255 --> 01:29:06,465
for the cultural fortress you built around us.

Prof, Yehuda Grossman, chairman

986
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:16,642
But my father insisted
and forced me to write "teacher."

987
01:29:16,810 --> 01:29:19,729
He also demanded to see the form,

988
01:29:19,896 --> 01:29:22,523
as only a manuscript researcher knows,

989
01:29:22,649 --> 01:29:25,109
to make sure I didn't make a mistake,

990
01:29:25,318 --> 01:29:28,946
or left space on the line, to add something.

991

Professor Shkolnik?

995
01:29:43,295 --> 01:29:47,131
I imagine you want to tell your loved ones.

996
01:29:47,299 --> 01:29:51,594
I just want to say, a registered
letter was mailed to you today.

997
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:03,898
The prize supervisor will contact you
to answer any questions.

998
01:30:03,982 --> 01:30:07,068
If I'm not mistaken, we'll meet on the 19th.

1004
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:25,836
Thank you.

1005
01:30:34,012 --> 01:30:37,306
-Hello, Professor Shkolnik?
-Hello.

1006
01:30:37,390 --> 01:30:40,142
I assume you know why I'm calling.

1007
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:41,727
No.

1008
01:30:42,145 --> 01:30:43,187
Why is she calling?

1009
01:30:43,271 --> 01:30:47,733
I'm happy to announce that you'll
receive the Israel Prize this year.

1010
01:30:47,818 --> 01:30:49,276
Congratulations.

1011
01:30:49,736 --> 01:30:52,488
-Professor Shkolnik?
-Yes.

1012
01:30:52,697 --> 01:30:55,866
I'm happy this prize
is going to you on my watch.

1013
01:30:56,535 --> 01:30:59,703
There are so few opportunities
to openly thank people like you

1014
01:30:59,830 --> 01:31:01,497
in the public arena.

1015
01:31:01,581 --> 01:31:04,458
I'm excited for you and proud
of your achievements,

1016
01:31:04,543 --> 01:31:06,961
your research and your educational activity.

1017
01:31:07,045 --> 01:31:11,382
If one has to define our profession,
the nature of our craft,

1018
01:31:11,633 --> 01:31:12,842
Thanks...
We teachers... Cultural Fortress...

Sifted flour

1021
01:31:17,180 --> 01:31:20,683

1022
01:31:20,767 --> 01:31:22,184
Important shift

1023
01:31:24,437 --> 01:31:25,729
We are teachers.

1024
01:31:26,106 --> 01:31:27,398
I'm not a teacher!

1025
01:31:28,567 --> 01:31:30,276
I'm a philologist!

1026
01:31:30,694 --> 01:31:34,155

1050
01:36:29,826 --> 01:36:33,704
Hello, Professor Shkolnik.
We need you at the rehearsal, please.

1051
01:36:38,209 --> 01:36:42,921
Every year, at least one recipient
gets confused on this stage.

1052
01:36:43,089 --> 01:36:45,007
It seems simple, but it isn't.

1053
01:36:45,175 --> 01:36:48,760
So I will have a separate
rehearsal with each one of you.

1054
01:36:48,928 --> 01:36:51,096
Listen carefully,

1055
01:36:51,264 --> 01:36:54,433
it's important to pay attention to details.

1056
01:36:54,601 --> 01:36:56,560
We don't want to see you fall,

1057
01:36:56,728 --> 01:36:59,396
or bump into a stand, or trip over a cable.

1058
01:36:59,564 --> 01:37:01,273
These things have happened.

1059
01:37:01,357 --> 01:37:04,359
I'll explain, and in the end, you'll get it.

1060
01:37:05,403 --> 01:37:08,447
Professor Shkolnik, we will rehearse now.

1061
01:37:08,615 --> 01:37:11,241
Professor Shkolnik?

1062
01:37:12,118 --> 01:37:14,912
You are the recipient for Talmud Research.

1063
01:37:15,079 --> 01:37:18,457
Stand up, please.
Get up, on your feet, get up.

1064
01:37:18,625 --> 01:37:22,002
When your name is called out, get up.
Yes, get up.

1065
01:37:22,170 --> 01:37:25,964
You stand like that until
you hear the judges' considerations.

1066
01:37:26,341 --> 01:37:28,050
Now, step out. To your left.

1067
01:37:32,847 --> 01:37:34,890
Here, right in front.

1068
01:37:35,058 --> 01:37:37,351
Do you see the President?

1069
01:37:37,435 --> 01:37:41,063
Come, here's my hand.
We're going over to the President.

1070
01:37:41,689 --> 01:37:43,607
We approach him, and you shake his hand.

1071
01:37:43,775 --> 01:37:45,776
Shake his hand.

1072
01:37:45,944 --> 01:37:47,069
Shake it with your right.

1073
01:37:47,153 --> 01:37:49,112
The President

1074
01:37:49,948 --> 01:37:52,032
Shake his hand.
Very good, you shook his hand.

1075
01:37:52,116 --> 01:37:55,035
We walk over to the Prime Minister,
to get the certificate.

1076
01:37:55,620 --> 01:37:56,912
Receive the certificate.

1077
01:37:56,996 --> 01:37:58,372
Excellent.

1078
01:37:58,498 --> 01:38:01,375
Hand it to the attendant
at your right. Give it to her.

1079
01:38:01,459 --> 01:38:02,543
Good.

1080
01:38:02,627 --> 01:38:05,963
Shake hands with the Prime Minister.

1081
01:38:06,130 --> 01:38:09,132
Now the Chairman of the Knesset.

1082
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:12,302
Shake his hand.

1083
01:38:12,470 --> 01:38:16,056
Shake it, shake it.

1084
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:58,825
Israel Prize Presentation Ceremony

1085
01:40:14,592 --> 01:40:17,302
Good evening and happy holiday
to our viewers at home,

1086
01:40:17,387 --> 01:40:24,393
and to the audience at the International
Convention Center in Jerusalem.

1087
01:40:25,019 --> 01:40:29,981
Welcome to the presentation ceremony
of the Israel Prize for this year.

1088
01:40:30,191 --> 01:40:31,858
Good evening, Danny Kushmaro.

1089
01:40:32,110 --> 01:40:33,694
Good evening to you, Meirav Miller,

1090
01:40:33,986 --> 01:40:37,280
and good evening to the recipients
of the Israel Prize.

1091
01:41:08,771 --> 01:41:13,608
As every year, we have convened
on Independence Day in Jerusalem,

1092
01:41:13,693 --> 01:41:15,986
to bestow the Israel Prizes.

1093
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:19,030
Ladies and gentlemen,
the national anthem, Hatikva.
