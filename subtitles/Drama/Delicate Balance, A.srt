My reputation's never been worse, so

You must like me for me

4
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:16,641
We can't make any promises

5
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:18,852
Now, can we, babe?

6
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:23,356
But you can make me a drink

7
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:24,983
Dive bar on the East Side

8
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:26,025
Where you at?

9
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:27,527
Phone lights up my nightstand

00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:33,491
In the back

13
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:35,118
Dark jeans and your Nikes

14
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,244
Look at you

15
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:38,371
Oh damn, never seen that color blue

16
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:42,625
Just think of the fun things we could do

17

But you can make me a drink

Is it cool that I said all that?

26
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:08,526
Is it chill that you're in my head?

Me and you

39
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:38,848
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view

40
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,809
Do the girls back home touch you

41

Up in my hair

Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs

Stay here, honey

46
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:53,363
