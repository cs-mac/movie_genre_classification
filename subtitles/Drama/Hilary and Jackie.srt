{2297}{2318}Hello.
{2324}{2369}Yes. I'll get her.
{2375}{2414}Yes. I'll tell her.
{2420}{2470}All right. Bye.
{2491}{2531}I've got a message|for you.
{2537}{2596}A secret one.
{2768}{2818}When I was but 13 or so,
{2824}{2860}I went into a golden land.
{2866}{2936}Cimbarozo Cotopaxi|took me by the hand!
{3368}{3397}Over the Orinoco...
{3403}{3459}across the blazing|Kalahari desert...
{3465}{3526}through the untamed|grasslands of the veldt.
{4470}{4494}What is it?
{4500}{4564}What did she say?
{4645}{4687}What did|she say that for?
{4693}{4724}It's all right.
{4730}{4741}I don't mind.
{4747}{4821}Everything's going|to be all right.
{7274}{7300}Hils, wake up.
{7306}{7399}Mummy's made a new song|for us to play.
{8276}{8334}B-flat. Listen.
{8634}{8696}Big waves...|rolling in 3/4 time.
{8737}{8790}When you hear me change|to the major chord,
{8796}{8855}I want you to dive down|under the sea.
{8945}{8998}Dive down|under the waves.
{9004}{9031}You're just|silvery fishes
{9037}{9089}swimming in and out|of the seaweed
{9095}{9147}in 6/8 time.
{9178}{9235}And... watch out,
{9247}{9292}here comes the shark!
{9517}{9547}"Dear Mrs. Du Pré,
{9553}{9569}"we are planning
{9575}{9606}"to broadcast|a children's performance
{9612}{9655}"of the toy symphony by..."
{9661}{9678}Haydn.
{9684}{9688}Very good.
{9694}{9741}"We would be delighted|if you would conduct
{9747}{9774}"and if your daughter|Hilary
{9780}{9818}would agree to play|the flute part."
{9824}{9850}It's from the BBC.
{9856}{9901}Jolly good.|Jolly good.
{9907}{9944}Well done,|hullabaloo.
{9950}{9965}Ha ha.
{9971}{9981}What about me?
{9987}{10037}If you practice hard enough,|maybe next time.
{10043}{10088}But I want to come|this time.
{10094}{10148}I want to be|with Hilary.
{10154}{10223}Couldn't she just|come along for the ride?
{10229}{10303}It's an orchestra, Derek,|not a Clapham omnibus.
{10337}{10394}Jackie, that is quite|uncalled for!
{10400}{10457}You're spoiling|Hilary's special day.
{10463}{10525}If Jackie can't come,|I won't go.
{11147}{11208}Follow the score, girl.|Don't gawp at the soloist.
{11428}{11473}I really can't|apologize enough.
{11479}{11499}Oh, not at all.
{11505}{11540}Worth any amount|of trouble
{11546}{11574}to get|young Hilary.
{11580}{11609}She's really|very special.
{11615}{11639}Yes, I realize that.
{11645}{11691}Your sister's|a remarkable girl.
{11697}{11727}You must be|very proud.
{11733}{11785}Oh, we all are.|Terribly proud.
{11791}{11852}Good-bye.
{11880}{11931}I am never going to go through|anything like that again.
{11937}{12008}If you want to be with Hilary,|you have to play as well as her.
{12014}{12031}If you want|to be together,
{12037}{12078}you've got to be|equally good.
{12084}{12111}Do you understand?
{12117}{12163}Yes.
{12536}{12596}Supper's|ready.
{12695}{12719}So I should think
{12725}{12775}we should leave some|money on the doorstep
{12781}{12807}for the burglar to take
{12813}{12853}so he wouldn't get in|anymore.
{12859}{12890}What do you think?
{12928}{12980}well, I think...
{13982}{14052}And the first prize|goes to the Du Pré sisters,
{14083}{14109}Jacqueline and Hilary.
{14115}{14168}Well done!
{14175}{14203}One for you.
{14209}{14258}One for you.
{14787}{14851}Shall I take that|for you?
{17056}{17110}In the woodwind category...
{17118}{17141}a very clear winner...
{17147}{17207}with the highest number|of points ever awarded
{17230}{17284}in this section|at this festival...
{17290}{17346}Hilary Du Pré.
{17405}{17461}Come along.
{17837}{17890}We had no difficulty at all
{17897}{17957}in choosing the winner|in the string section,
{17964}{18019}even though we were|a little unnerved
{18025}{18073}by the candidate's rather...
{18079}{18135}overemphatic|bodily movements.
{18141}{18203}I think this must be|the first time
{18209}{18286}that our winning soloists|have been sisters.
{18374}{18427}The judges were unanimous
{18433}{18497}in choosing|miss Jacqueline Du Pré.
{19473}{19510}Ladies and gentlemen,
{19516}{19534}we have many more awards,
{19540}{19600}so I beg for you all|to sit down just...
{20411}{20453}She does move about|a bit.
{20459}{20520}She looks like one of|these Bobby Soxer types.
{20547}{20580}I must say that's my fault.
{20586}{20628}They did a lot of music|and movement
{20634}{20648}when they were younger.
{20654}{20707}Excuse me. Can I have|a picture, please?
{20713}{20776}Yeah, you, too, sir.|That's lovely. Yeah.
{20804}{20863}Nice big smiles.
{20940}{20991}Hils! Hils!
{20997}{21035}Come over.
{21112}{21171}Is this one of yours?|Does she play?
{21194}{21198}Oh, yes.
{21204}{21235}Hilary won as well,|didn't you, dear?
{21241}{21278}We can have|a family portrait.
{21284}{21287}Right.
{21293}{21344}Could you hold your flute|up where I can see it?
{21350}{21365}Smile then.
{21371}{21403}Your sister's|a remarkable girl.
{21409}{21430}You must be very proud.
{21436}{21496}Oh, yes, we are.|Terribly proud.
{21543}{21593}Smile then!
{22035}{22063}Well, then...
{22069}{22085}be good.
{22091}{22139}We'll collect you|in an hour.
{22145}{22173}Be good.
{22179}{22215}Yes.
{22470}{22502}Now...
{22508}{22551}let's see|what you can do.
{22774}{22798}An hour today,
{22804}{22844}and then|see how it goes.
{22854}{22897}Oh.
{23067}{23127}There.
{23222}{23296}Well, now,|this is nice.
{23983}{24000}No.
{24006}{24064}Try that... that lifting,
{24070}{24120}that upbeat|before the 3 quavers
{24126}{24169}with an up bow.
{24175}{24237}Like... like so.
{24354}{24426}I like him.|He's my cello daddy.
{24432}{24464}I want to come every day.
{24470}{24508}Can I come every day?
{24514}{24544}Do you mind?
{24550}{24607}We shall have|to get a car.
{24613}{24669}Oh.
{26691}{26728}That's it.
{26734}{26758}She's ready.
{26764}{26808}Mrs. Du Pré,|what do you think
{26814}{26877}of a debut recital|at the Wigmore Hall?
{26883}{26890}Marvellous.
{26896}{26923}I've spoken|to Ibbs and Tillet...
{26929}{26987}they'll handle the publicity|and the tickets...
{26993}{27013}and to Ernest Lush.
{27019}{27074}He'll accompany her|on the piano.
{27080}{27118}Oh.
{27801}{27867}She's playing flat.
{27927}{27946}Ladies and gentlemen,
{27952}{27997}I'm afraid that my "a" string|has come loose,
{28003}{28060}and I'm going to have|to restring my cello
{28066}{28138}and start again.
{28146}{28223}Well, at least|it wasn't my "g" string.
{29150}{29219}I do wish she'd keep|that head still.
{29225}{29247}Looks so flamboyant,
{29253}{29328}all that hair flying|about the place.
{29340}{29400}Oh. There she is.
{29456}{29531}They want me to play|at a wedding in Italy.
{29572}{29591}It's a princess' wedding.
{29597}{29644}You will come, won't you?|I'd be terrified alone.
{29650}{29712}Congratulations.|You were wonderful.
{29718}{29735}Oh, thank you.
{29741}{29773}Um, excuse me, everyone.
{29779}{29808}Attention, please.
{29814}{29835}Thank you.
{29841}{29905}Jackie's debut|went very well.
{29911}{29931}I'm sure you would agree.
{29937}{30000}And to mark the occasion,|a very generous friend
{30036}{30094}who wishes|to remain anonymous...
{30116}{30187}has offered her this.
{30349}{30421}It's one of the finest|cellos ever made.
{30482}{30541}It's called the Davidov.
{30707}{30783}The magic|is in the varnish.
{30796}{30835}So you must|keep it away
{30841}{30878}from the extremes|of temperature.
{30884}{30913}Another problem|is the insurance.
{30919}{30974}So don't let it|get out of your sight.
{30980}{31044}It will give you|the world, Jackie.
{31063}{31144}You must give it|yourself.
{31473}{31532}Fratello Othello.
{31538}{31571}Spaghetti.
{31577}{31612}Spaghetti.
{31618}{31673}Spaghetti Fra Gola.
{31679}{31718}Si. Fra Gola.
{31724}{31742}Si?
{31748}{31799}Si.
{31870}{31927}Uffici de ponte.
{31933}{31946}Ah.
{31952}{31985}Uffici de Firenze.
{31991}{32010}Firenze?
{32016}{32025}Capri.
{32031}{32067}Ah, Capri|bellisimo.
{32073}{32106}Si, bellisimo!
{32112}{32133}Si, bellisimo!
{32139}{32193}Si, fortissimo!
{32226}{32289}Shh. Shh.
{33107}{33169}The bubbles are so...
{33245}{33258}Ok.
{33264}{33290}Here's to Hilary and Jackie
{33296}{33371}and all who've seen enough.
{33449}{33476}Mmm.
{33514}{33570}Hils, look.
{33661}{33710}Wow.
{33716}{33776}We're in heaven.
{33782}{33868}Oh, put that|bloody light out.
{34238}{34261}Excuse me.
{34267}{34298}Have you seen|my sister?
{34304}{34350}Is your sister|Jacqueline Du Pré?
{34356}{34363}Yes.
{34369}{34395}She'll be in Berlin|by now.
{34401}{34482}She's playing the Haydn|cello concerto in c.
{34504}{34552}Oh.
{34601}{34647}You going back|to London?
{34653}{34709}Yes. I suppose so.
{35640}{35708}Oh. Stop, stop,|stop, stop, stop.
{35752}{35804}What is this blasted|jigging about?
{35810}{35841}Stand still, girl.
{35847}{35870}Stand still.
{35876}{35941}It is impossible|to produce a proper tone
{35947}{36028}without proper|deportment.
{36340}{36365}You have no technique.
{36371}{36415}That's all right.|Technique can be taught.
{36421}{36492}We just have to go back|to the beginning
{36498}{36524}and start again.
{36530}{36607}Cancel any concert dates|you may have outstanding.
{36613}{36689}Yes, Mr. Bentley.
{36899}{36931}Oh, Hilary...
{36937}{36973}how is your|marvellous sister?
{36979}{37034}I'm not sure.|She's away at the moment.
{37040}{37064}In Russia.
{37070}{37136}Oh.
{37454}{37513}That's it,|old boy...
{37519}{37595}keep trying.
{37627}{37713}That's it!
{37719}{37790}Ooh.|I felt that.
{37796}{37819}Listen.
{37825}{37852}Well done, boy.
{37858}{37884}What is it?
{37890}{37953}That is radio Moscow.
{37959}{37994}This is what Jackie|will be hearing
{38000}{38075}if she's listening|to the wireless.
{38277}{38329}No.
{38335}{38362}No.
{38368}{38387}No!
{38393}{38409}No!
{38415}{38473}No!
{38563}{38606}Instead of rehearsing|this piece,
{38612}{38636}I just want you
{38642}{38717}to practice playing|b-flat.
{38726}{38772}Just the note b-flat?
{38778}{38803}The note.
{38809}{38878}Just the note.
{39068}{39090}Thanks.
{39096}{39161}Parcel from Jacks,|everybody!
{39220}{39245}Want help?
{39251}{39285}Well, open it!
{39291}{39315}Can't open it.
{39321}{39336}Hils...
{39342}{39357}can't break it.
{39363}{39421}Here, Hil.|Let me.
{39490}{39543}It's her washing.
{39549}{39582}I suppose|it must be difficult
{39588}{39659}getting her washing done|in a foreign country.
{39836}{39879}Good afternoon,|ma'am.
{39885}{39967}My niece|is a student.
{40095}{40124}Embouchure.
{40130}{40165}Embouchure.
{40171}{40208}Miss Du Pré.|Yes?
{40214}{40253}I was wondering, could I|book you for a concert?
{40259}{40304}No, it's not me you want.|It's my sister.
{40310}{40359}But you're|Hilary Du Pré...
{40365}{40389}the flautist?
{40395}{40402}Yes.
{40408}{40470}Yes, it's you I want.|The Bach b-minor.
{40479}{40494}Oh.
{40500}{40509}Oh, I'm sorry.
{40515}{40550}I'm not allowed|to play concerts
{40556}{40575}until|after my exam.
{40581}{40613}Oh. Well,|when's your exam?
{40619}{40652}Right now,|as a matter of fact.
{40658}{40721}Oh, well, in that case,|I'll wait.
{40857}{40908}Please.
{40923}{40951}Good.
{40957}{40996}Good.
{41006}{41045}Good.
{41175}{41223}Would you like to try|that for us again,
{41229}{41295}please, Hilary?
{41515}{41583}Again.
{41698}{41766}Again.
{42045}{42107}Miss Du Pré.
{43532}{43607}Look, do I get my booking?
{43613}{43664}Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
{43670}{43732}You ran off.|I followed you home.
{43751}{43794}Oh.
{43803}{43868}You don't mind,|do you?
{43913}{43943}No...
{43949}{44002}as a matter of fact.
{44092}{44145}I'd ask you in, but, um...
{44192}{44219}it's a bit awkward.
{44225}{44315}My sister's just come home.
{44490}{44574}All right.
{44596}{44672}Best go in.
{44679}{44711}What do you think|you're doing?
{44717}{44771}Well, if you're not going|to invite me to tea,
{44777}{44850}I shall just have to make|a nuisance of myself.
{44903}{44931}You c...
{44982}{45017}Do you know...
{45023}{45076}I'm starving.
{45115}{45149}Ooh.
{45155}{45211}Come here.
{45356}{45408}Ohh!
{45459}{45503}Hello.
{45509}{45531}Who's this?
{45537}{45554}Kiffer Finzi.
{45560}{45585}I'm in love|with Hilary.
{45591}{45650}And you're|Hilary's sister.
{45656}{45684}What do you do?
{45690}{45715}I'm a musician.
{45721}{45775}Oh, following in Hils'|footsteps, are you?
{45781}{45833}Are you any good?
{45839}{45843}Hello!
{45849}{45939}Kiffer Finzi. Very|pleased to meet you.
{45946}{45977}You don't mind|if I start, do you?
{45983}{46014}Exams really do give|you an appetite.
{46020}{46059}Your exam!|How did it go?
{46065}{46067}Oh.
{46073}{46134}Famously. She's been offered|professional bookings.
{46140}{46214}5 quid to do the Bach b-minor|next week in Newbury.
{46220}{46297}Isn't that right?
{46304}{46312}Yeah.
{46318}{46356}You must be very proud of her.
{46362}{46374}Yes, I am.
{46380}{46392}Mmm. These are delicious.
{46398}{46461}Absolutely throwing it|there outside.
{46479}{46500}I got soaked.
{46506}{46555}Shall I be mum?
{46561}{46630}Oh, a nice cup of tea.
{46691}{46745}I just screamed.|It was so embarrassing.
{46751}{46831}So, have you|been with him?
{46892}{46923}No.
{46929}{46979}Of course not.
{46985}{47047}No.
{47100}{47180}Why? Have you been|with somebody?
{47228}{47253}I'm thinking my answer,
{47259}{47318}and you're going to have|to read my mind.
{47332}{47390}All right.
{47486}{47525}Oh, my lord, you have.
{47531}{47605}You study in scarlet!
{47614}{47671}What about you,|Hils?
{47677}{47692}Been with anyone?
{47698}{47768}Now you'll have|to read my mind.
{47868}{47900}Oh, poor Hils.
{47906}{47936}Maybe one day.
{47942}{48010}Then again, maybe not.
{48517}{48578}"Hilary Du Pré is a flautist|of immense expressive
{48584}{48611}"as well as technical ability.
{48617}{48683}She obviously has|a great future ahead of her."
{48689}{48731}Does it mention|Jackie?
{48737}{48774}Why? She wasn't playing.
{48780}{48842}I wonder if I might ask you|to keep your voice down.
{48848}{48869}Jackie's asleep.
{48875}{48905}What, she's here?
{48911}{48920}Yes. You've met.
{48926}{48976}She should get up,|read the review!
{48982}{49009}No, you mustn't wake her.
{49015}{49066}Kiffer.
{49072}{49083}Where's he going?
{49089}{49157}Come on!|Up, out of that bed!
{49163}{49239}Your friend is making|rather a lot of noise.
{49245}{49306}Up, up!
{49397}{49439}Look. Read.
{49445}{49504}Oh, we're off|to the pictures.
{49510}{49527}Can I come?
{49533}{49569}No, you can't come.|It's a date.
{49575}{49637}We're going to see|Jules et Jim.
{49643}{49685}Sounds French.|Where's it playing?
{49691}{49724}In France.
{49730}{49747}It's by François Truffaut.
{49753}{49808}It's playing at the Scala|on Wardour street.
{49814}{49834}That's in Soho.
{49840}{49908}Yes. I thought we could|go to Maison Bertaux,
{49914}{49961}seeing as we're|in a French mood.
{49967}{50029}You do realize there|are white slavers
{50035}{50073}working|in that area?
{50079}{50116}Hmm?
{50122}{50137}No self-respecting man
{50143}{50188}would ask a woman|to go to such a place.
{50194}{50280}It's out|of the question.
{50308}{50313}I'm sorry.
{50319}{50388}It's completely|out of the question.
{50477}{50514}Well...
{50520}{50575}no chance of a lift, then?
{50583}{50646}Come on.
{51803}{51864}Jacks.
{51952}{52013}Jacks.
{52019}{52090}Kiffer's asked me|to marry him.
{52096}{52104}What?
{52110}{52190}Kiffer's asked me|to marry him.
{52203}{52278}Well, what do you think?
{52311}{52386}Well, that's just silly.
{52392}{52479}Look, Hils. You don't|have to marry him.
{52605}{52654}Do you know|what that is?
{52660}{52725}That, my dear,|is a Dutch cap.
{52740}{52786}It's a contraceptive.
{52792}{52859}Is it really?
{52865}{52895}Hmm.
{52901}{52939}Where did you get it?
{52945}{52986}Doc fitted me up.
{52992}{53068}Oh, come on, Hils.
{53086}{53158}Let's get a flat|together and go bonkers.
{53164}{53213}We could have all|the men we wanted to.
{53219}{53301}I'm going to Marry Kiffer.
{53341}{53419}I love him.
{53425}{53450}He loves me.
{53456}{53496}He does not love you.
{53502}{53562}He just wants to get|into your knickers.
{53568}{53607}You don't have|to get married
{53613}{53650}every time|you fancy a screw.
{53656}{53688}That's what these|are for.
{53694}{53776}I want to get married.
{53784}{53867}Well,|you can't marry him.
{53980}{54002}You can't just leave me.
{54008}{54086}I'm not leaving you.|You're not here anymore.
{54100}{54125}You never will be again.
{54131}{54192}Haven't you heard?|I'm giving up the cello.
{54198}{54227}Oh, don't be silly.
{54233}{54276}I can do what I want.
{54282}{54332}But you don't know anything|apart from the cello.
{54338}{54417}I don't know anything|apart from the flute.
{54437}{54495}We're babies, Jacks.
{54501}{54534}Kiffer laughs at me.
{54540}{54626}Then why are you|marrying him?
{54632}{54706}Because he makes me|feel special.
{54712}{54761}That's a big swizz,
{54767}{54832}because the truth is...
{54838}{54930}you're not special.
{55149}{55245}I thought you'd be|happy for me.
{55651}{55740}This is nice.
{56652}{56681}Hi.
{56687}{56708}Good god.
{56714}{56751}What on earth|are you wearing?
{56757}{56819}It's fab, isn't it?|Danny bought it for me.
{56825}{56860}This is Danny,|by the way.
{56866}{56909}Danny,|this is daddy.
{56915}{56991}Daddy-o.
{57145}{57173}Barenboim.
{57179}{57223}I thought he was|from Argentina.
{57229}{57273}Surely that must be|a German name.
{57279}{57325}I think it must|be Jewish.
{57331}{57372}Oh.
{57378}{57405}Oh, dear.
{57411}{57470}I had a large breakfast|this morning.
{57476}{57523}He's a pig.
{57529}{57598}I have got plenty more.|Piers, dig in.
{57604}{57628}Anyway, mummy,
{57634}{57675}we're really desperate|to get married,
{57681}{57768}but lord knows when|we'll have the time.
{57787}{57867}Of course. It's best not|to rush these things.
{57873}{57938}I'm completely|booked up until may.
{57944}{57978}And Danny's|booked up...
{57984}{57987}June.
{57993}{58022}He's such a show-off,|but he's very handsome.
{58028}{58086}Of course, we only|really meet in airports.
{58092}{58141}We're going to do more|joint bookings together.
{58147}{58191}Sort of a duo,|like the Beatles.
{58197}{58228}There are 4 Beatles,|actually.
{58234}{58250}Are there?
{58256}{58267}Mm-hmm.|Oh.
{58273}{58309}Anyway, when we do|get married,
{58315}{58333}we're going|to get married
{58339}{58364}somewhere|wildly romantic
{58370}{58403}like the wailing wall|in Jerusalem.
{58409}{58470}Don't you have to be Jewish|to be married there?
{58476}{58547}Yes, that's right.|I'm going to be Jewish.
{58553}{58586}I'm having lessons|already.
{58592}{58622}Instruction, not lessons.
{58628}{58642}Oh.
{58648}{58723}So, what do you think?
{58786}{58865}Why are you talking funny?
{58871}{58920}Am I?
{58926}{58939}Nobody becomes Jewish.
{58945}{59027}I know for a fact you can't|just convert to Judaism.
{59038}{59057}Bye-bye now.
{59063}{59093}Leave it to me.
{59099}{59144}Honestly,|I can sort it out.
{59150}{59224}Oh, uh...
{59248}{59336}She can't possibly be|Jewish, for god's sake.
{59342}{59416}She's blond.
{59471}{59561}They call them|the Arthur and Guinevere
{59569}{59586}of music's Camelot.
{59592}{59643}The blossoming romance|between Jacqueline Du Pré
{59649}{59715}and the Argentinean pianist|Daniel Barenboim
{59721}{59783}has taken the world|by storm.
{59789}{59835}Up a bit higher.
{59841}{59860}That's it.
{59866}{59921}Oh, I can see them now.
{59927}{59975}Miss Du Pré astonished|the British public
{59981}{60055}with her brilliant rendition|of Elgar's cello concerto.
{60061}{60079}Piers!
{60085}{60133}Fresh from a triumphant|series...
{60139}{60198}You've ruined it now.
{60204}{60279}The couple has just|announced their engagement.
{60288}{60349}Miss Du Pré is converting|to Judaism.
{60355}{60370}And they plan to wed
{60376}{60422}in Barenboim's adopted|home of Israel
{60428}{60493}in the golden city|of Jerusalem.
{62407}{62442}Both asleep.
{62448}{62516}Coming.
{62710}{62728}Mmm.
{62734}{62842}Mmm.
{63010}{63052}Aah!
{63058}{63088}Oh, they're freezing!
{63094}{63139}Cold fingers are|very stimulating.
{63145}{63204}No, they're|bloody well not.
{63210}{63322}Shh.
{63470}{63522}What?
{63528}{63574}Oh, ok.
{63580}{63692}Here we go.
{63698}{63727}Mind your head.
{63915}{63974}Your nose is cold, too!
{64046}{64070}Someone's coming.
{64076}{64091}They can't be.
{64097}{64164}Well, they are, you know.
{64514}{64588}Jackie.
{64977}{65057}Oh, darling.
{65152}{65245}Why didn't you tell us?
{65498}{65595}Do I have to walk|all the way down there?
{65602}{65681}Come on.
{65822}{65874}Ok, yes, please.
{65880}{65951}So, Hilary, listen.
{65957}{66030}Oh, no, I've forgotten|it now. Shit.
{66036}{66079}How does it go?
{66085}{66151}Oh, I know this,|I know this.
{66157}{66194}Oh, yes.
{66200}{66225}Dvorak.
{66231}{66256}Yes.
{66262}{66295}Absolutely.
{66301}{66329}You two are telepathic.
{66335}{66366}It's true.|It's true.
{66372}{66388}Oh, rubbish.
{66394}{66438}Do another one.
{66444}{66511}All right.
{66546}{66610}Ok.
{66616}{66699}You listening?
{66761}{66807}I know this. This|is dies Natalis
{66813}{66865}by Kiffer's father.
{66871}{66939}All right, go on.|Do another one.
{66996}{67010}Ok, um...
{67016}{67081}don't tap it.|Just think it.
{67129}{67152}Ok.
{67158}{67202}All right.
{67208}{67270}You really got me|by the kinks.
{67326}{67341}Absolutely.
{67347}{67379}You're just|saying that.
{67385}{67391}No, it's true.
{67397}{67454}We always know what|the other one is thinking.
{67465}{67504}You know what|I'm thinking now,
{67510}{67530}don't you, sis?
{67536}{67568}Not really.
{67574}{67600}Yes, you do.
{67606}{67650}No, I don't.
{67656}{67679}I'll tell you.
{67685}{67693}No.
{67699}{67763}I mean, just tell me.
{67873}{67933}I want|to sleep with Kiffer.
{68087}{68124}You don't mind,|do you, sis?
{68130}{68159}We always did say
{68165}{68222}that we'd share|everything, remember?
{68440}{68506}What?
{68536}{68545}What is it?
{68551}{68626}Nothing. I think|we should all go to bed.
{68666}{68696}I don't want|to go to bed.
{68714}{68786}I could stay up|all night.
{70464}{70488}Well, you have|to be very careful,
{70494}{70578}'cause it's very easy to|stand on one, isn't it?
{70584}{70639}Why don't you look|around there?
{70645}{70724}I think you might be|standing on one.
{70798}{70830}I'm just going over|to the Williams' place
{70836}{70853}for cheese, luv.
{70859}{70882}I'll come with you.
{70888}{70947}I thought you had jet lag.
{70953}{71046}The walk will help.
{71085}{71111}Why don't you two|go together,
{71117}{71156}and I can get on|with the gutters?
{71162}{71218}Fine.
{71224}{71286}Actually I'd just|as soon stay here.
{71292}{71334}Me, too.|It's settled, then.
{71340}{71384}Kiffer goes off|for the cheese
{71390}{71402}and we stay here.
{71408}{71509}I'll get the fucking|cheese, all right?
{71656}{71706}I think you should|go with her.
{71712}{71740}Why?
{71746}{71823}'Cause she doesn't|know the way.
{71974}{72027}Jackie!
{72118}{72190}Jackie!
{72480}{72555}Jackie!
{72634}{72715}Jackie!
{72721}{72760}Jackie!
{72766}{72832}Jackie!
{72898}{72970}Jackie!
{73073}{73137}Jackie.
{73260}{73324}Get away from me!
{73330}{73378}You don't love me!
{73384}{73444}Don't fucking love me!
{73463}{73534}All I want is a fuck.
{73671}{73692}Jackie.
{73698}{73741}Aah!
{73747}{73759}Come on.
{73765}{73826}All I want is a fucking fuck,|for fuck's sake!
{73889}{73935}It's ok.
{73941}{74007}Ohh!
{74016}{74087}It's all right.
{74172}{74233}No.
{74304}{74343}We have to.
{74349}{74369}No, we don't have to.
{74375}{74417}Why would anyone have to?
{74423}{74469}Because she's my sister.
{74475}{74500}Yes, well,|I think you'll find
{74506}{74533}that this is not|the sort of thing
{74539}{74576}that sisters normally|ask one another.
{74582}{74633}Because I'm scared.
{74639}{74726}Yes, well,|she doesn't scare me.
{74737}{74797}I'm sure it would|just be the once.
{74803}{74859}Just the once, huh?
{74865}{74917}I wouldn't have asked.|Any particular position?
{74923}{74966}She just needs proof.
{74972}{75041}Proof of what,|for god's sake?
{75048}{75119}Proof that|somebody loves her.
{75428}{75497}She just went.
{75506}{75579}Didn't say a word.|Didn't...
{75585}{75661}cancel|her engagements.
{75820}{75890}How does she|seem to you?
{75900}{75985}Well, she has been acting|a little oddly.
{76453}{76469}It's beautiful.
{76475}{76519}I can see why|you wanted to come here
{76525}{76597}instead of Los Angeles.
{76623}{76679}Don't worry about|the cancellations, by the way.
{76685}{76712}I've seen to them.
{76718}{76771}Everyone was|very understanding.
{76777}{76842}No one wants to put|pressure on you,
{76864}{76978}so don't worry.
{77119}{77157}So...
{77163}{77207}Which is the daddy?
{77213}{77239}Which one?
{77245}{77272}There's a slate mine
{77278}{77346}on the other side|of the mountain.
{77352}{77404}Kiffer,|look what Theresa's found.
{77410}{77474}Will you excuse me|a moment?
{77480}{77574}Is that the one|with that one?
{77580}{77674}I was thinking...
{77694}{77760}if Kiffer and Hilary|can do it, so can we.
{77766}{77832}We can buy a house|near here if you like.
{77838}{77932}It would cost|next to nothing.
{77938}{77964}We could have all we needed.
{77970}{78051}We could have a little studio,|rehearsal rooms,
{78057}{78073}phones.
{78079}{78150}We could have a helipad.
{78156}{78189}What do you say?
{78195}{78277}Pbltlllt!
{78404}{78481}I try to give her|everything she wants.
{78487}{78571}I don't know|what she wants.
{78606}{78677}Do you know|what she wants?
{78683}{78767}Not really.
{78851}{78949}Look after her,|won't you, Kiffer?
{79373}{79459}That's better.|It's just us again.
{81430}{81466}You know you|can't have toast.
{81472}{81538}I don't know why|you keep asking.
{81544}{81604}Daddy, I want toast.
{81610}{81643}Toast?
{81649}{81692}Toast? I want|toast, too.
{81698}{81713}Could we|have toast?
{81719}{81807}I haven't had a chance|to light the fire yet.
{81822}{81885}Well, we'll light|the fire, won't we?
{81891}{81940}Let's light the fire.
{81946}{81957}Yes.
{81963}{82020}There.|Take some of these
{82037}{82111}and put them|on the fire.
{82179}{82231}I feel a million dollars|this morning.
{82237}{82314}That was exactly what|the doctor ordered.
{82589}{82667}Oh, thank you, Hils.
{82698}{82739}You don't mind, do you?
{82745}{82834}No, of course not.
{82875}{82948}Well, here we all are.
{82954}{82982}Wouldn't it be wonderful
{82988}{83066}if we could stay|like this forever?
{83072}{83092}Get this one.
{83098}{83113}You get that one.
{83119}{83201}Come on. Throw some more|logs on the fire.
{85665}{85702}Come on! Throw it!
{85708}{85757}Come on,|throw it, throw it,
{85763}{85800}throw it, throw it!|Come on!
{85806}{85884}Come on!
{85951}{86024}Come on!
{86071}{86156}Come on, let's go.
{86342}{86410}Here, Kif.
{86416}{86438}Come on.
{86444}{86515}Come on, sweetie.
{86578}{86640}Kif, what are you doing?
{86646}{86707}I'm kissing you.
{86713}{86746}It's me... Hils.
{86752}{86814}I know.
{86827}{86904}You're my wife.
{87209}{87231}What about Jack?
{87237}{87300}What about her?
{87323}{87337}Ok.
{87343}{87380}What if she wakes up?
{87386}{87461}Look, I don't care.
{87531}{87602}Oh, that's good.
{87801}{87868}Oh, shh, shh. Shh.|Kiffer, shh.
{87874}{87960}Kiffer.
{87966}{88064}Kiffer.
{88198}{88252}Oh, god.
{88258}{88305}Kiffer. Shh.
{88311}{88400}Stop. Get off me.|Get off me.
{88437}{88451}Get off me!
{88457}{88517}She'll never|talk to me again now.
{88523}{88597}You've got to start|saying no to her.
{88613}{88691}The more you give her,|the more she wants.
{88752}{88824}You've got to start|saying no to her.
{89202}{89290}I've given you|everything.
{89410}{89436}Ever since we were little,
{89442}{89536}everything you've asked for|I've said yes.
{89622}{89729}Jackie, listen.
{89767}{89861}Jackie...
{89920}{89991}Jackie...
{90147}{90244}I'm sorry.
{91073}{91161}Cimbarozo Cotopaxi|took me by the hand...
{91195}{91228}over the Orinoco...
{91234}{91311}across the blazing|Kalahari desert...
{91317}{91378}through the untamed|grasslands of the valley.
{91384}{91447}We're in heaven.
{91453}{91563}Oh, put that|bloody light out.
{91694}{91716}Psst.
{91722}{91774}Psst.
{91790}{91861}Come. We must go.|You have a plane.
{91867}{91870}What?
{91876}{91955}Your plane to Germany|for your concert tonight.
{91981}{92002}What about my sister?
{92008}{92064}She will be taken|to her England plane.
{92070}{92158}It's all arranged.|You must hurry.
{94106}{94139}Very good.
{94145}{94168}Romantic.
{94174}{94225}We understand this.
{94231}{94236}Really?
{94242}{94309}I'm afraid I don't know|a bloody word, frankly.
{94315}{94363}Please?
{94369}{94389}Danke.
{94395}{94407}Bitte.
{94413}{94476}Ich bin ein Hamburger.
{95033}{95048}Yeah.
{95054}{95113}Wunderbar!
{95786}{95875}Oh, um, I'm sorry,|I'm sorry. Wrong number.
{95882}{95964}Entschuldigen.
{96069}{96154}Hello, mummy.|Is Hilary there? Can...
{96160}{96193}oh, sorry. Uh, sorry.
{96199}{96289}S-sorry, no, wrong number.|Sorry.
{97163}{97246}Fantastico,|fantastico, querida.
{97253}{97288}Casals was in|the audience tonight.
{97294}{97327}He was most impressed.
{97333}{97386}We would be honoured|if you'd join us for supper.
{97392}{97424}Oh, I'd love to.
{97430}{97501}Only the problem is,|is that I stink.
{97520}{97528}Excuse me?
{97534}{97581}Um, well, the sweat|just runs off me
{97587}{97613}when I'm playing.|What about Pablo?
{97619}{97657}Does he have|the same problem? Look.
{97663}{97723}Idios mío!
{97756}{97789}Excuse me, um...
{97795}{97850}my clothes are dirty,|and I'd like to wash them.
{97873}{97918}Uh... wash, yes?
{97924}{97978}Um, dirty.|Washing?
{97984}{98002}S^. Lavadero.
{98008}{98061}Well, there's no plug,|and it's too small.
{98067}{98137}No. Lavadero.|Lávelo all.
{98388}{98440}Lo siento mucho, señora.
{98446}{98524}Look, look, is there|a washing machine?
{98595}{98693}Ay, esos ingleses...
{99243}{99329}Shut up!
{100181}{100246}The maestro's|pleased to see you.
{100252}{100309}He thinks you're going|to be a great cellist.
{100315}{100369}He wants to know|if all is well.
{100375}{100401}Do you have|happiness here?
{100407}{100488}Gosh. Yes. Heaps of it.|It's just, um...
{100522}{100562}it's just the cello.
{100568}{100602}Well, it's silly, really.
{100608}{100675}I just don't want|to be a cellist after all.
{100700}{100756}Well, I never asked|to be a cellist, you see?
{100762}{100774}It's all just a big cock-up.
{100780}{100827}One day, I was just playing,|and then the next day,
{100833}{100899}I was booked up|for the next 2 years.
{100905}{100977}I hate the cello,|if you want to know.
{100983}{101070}I think I understand|this wrong.
{101097}{101133}Yes.
{101139}{101208}Thank you.
{102816}{102870}Home.
{102876}{102962}This is what my home|smells like.
{104849}{104919}Aah!
{104948}{104971}Hello!
{104977}{104997}Who's this?
{105003}{105050}Kiffer.|Kiffer Finzi.
{105056}{105139}I'm in love|with Hilary.
{105162}{105209}I shan't be very late.
{105215}{105307}I came back|to see you.
{105356}{105413}I shan't be long.
{105419}{105470}It was terribly funny.
{105476}{105518}I'm going to get a job,
{105524}{105587}and I'm going to be|an ordinary person like you.
{105593}{105656}You couldn't be|ordinary in a million years.
{105662}{105723}And you don't know anything|apart from the cello.
{105729}{105814}I don't know anything|apart from the flute.
{105820}{105904}Jackie, we're babies.
{105910}{105953}Kiffer laughs at me.
{105959}{106005}Then why are you|marrying him?
{106011}{106098}Because he makes me|feel special.
{106143}{106205}You don't understand|that because...
{106211}{106292}you don't have anybody|to make you feel special.
{106306}{106374}That's a big swizz.
{106391}{106460}Because the truth is|that you're not special.
{106466}{106546}If you think that being|an ordinary person
{106552}{106618}is any easier than being|an extraordinary one,
{106624}{106714}you're wrong.
{106732}{106782}If you didn't have|that cello to prop you up,
{106788}{106873}you'd be nothing.
{107987}{108063}Who's that?
{108160}{108223}Hey, Freud.
{108229}{108265}You like Freud?
{108271}{108361}Yes. He'd be a lot better|if he hadn't invented
{108368}{108453}the atom bomb, though,|wouldn't he?
{108599}{108647}Are you|Jacqueline Du Pré?
{108653}{108658}Yes, I am.
{108664}{108716}I've heard about you.|I'm Daniel Barenboim.
{108722}{108744}I've heard about you, too.
{108750}{108792}Really?|What have you heard?
{108798}{108856}I heard that you had|glandular fever.
{108862}{108901}That's right.
{108907}{108934}It's very infectious,|isn't it?
{108940}{108966}So you'd better|keep your distance.
{108972}{109023}Oh, it's not infectious.|It's contagious.
{109029}{109059}You have to have|bodily contact
{109065}{109079}with the other person.
{109085}{109177}So you can talk to me,|but you can't kiss me.
{109224}{109250}Jackie.
{109256}{109319}You left this|in the cab.
{109325}{109356}Silly girl.
{109362}{109406}Thank you.
{109412}{109438}So, you are a musician?
{109444}{109461}Yes, I am a musician.
{109467}{109505}You know very well|that I'm a musician.
{109511}{109552}A very famous musician,|actually.
{109558}{109597}Well, you don't look|like a musician.
{109603}{109667}So what are musicians|supposed to look like, then?
{109673}{109740}They're not|usually so blond.
{109746}{109803}Danny, we should go.
{109809}{109855}I have to go.
{109861}{109897}I'd love to talk to you|sometime
{109903}{109986}about glandular fever.
{111487}{111558}Paderewski medal.
{111564}{111631}Beethoven medal.
{111682}{111750}You name it.
{111762}{111789}Well...
{111795}{111888}I won a talent contest|in Camden.
{111908}{112002}And I won in Purley.
{112008}{112027}Where's Purley?
{112033}{112110}Oh, you wouldn't|know it.
{112116}{112184}Moscow.
{112190}{112271}I won in Moscow.
{112277}{112376}I made miss Mouncey cry.
{112388}{112478}Who is miss Mouncey?
{112484}{112567}Who is miss Mouncey?
{112615}{112678}Who is miss Mouncey?
{112684}{112775}She's my math teacher.
{112821}{112851}What about you?
{112857}{112942}Did you ever|make anyone cry?
{112973}{113090}Mmm... no. I never|made anyone cry.
{113180}{113254}Thank you.
{113303}{113402}I'm sorry I treated|you so badly.
{113442}{113461}I should've known
{113467}{113547}you'll never|let me down.
{115559}{115653}Now that, that's how|to play Beethoven.
{115659}{115708}It's too slow. You're|coming in too slow.
{115714}{115793}No, you're too fast.|You're throwing it away.
{115799}{115849}No, you have|to do it again.
{115855}{115915}I think I'll decide|the tempo.
{115921}{115944}Are you all right?
{115950}{116016}Yeah. I just got|cold hands.
{116022}{116101}Here.
{116125}{116132}Listen to that.
{116138}{116202}It sounds like|you're running for a bus.
{116208}{116287}I've never run|for a bus in my life.
{116441}{116482}To keep|your hands warm.
{116488}{116538}Oh, Danny.
{116544}{116618}She's very vigorous|with the bow, hmm.
{116624}{116675}So there has to be|an unusual amount of room
{116681}{116723}under the arm, here.
{116729}{116761}And, ha...
{116767}{116799}sweat, sweat|is the main problem.
{116805}{116894}So that the seams have to be|a lot stronger than normal.
{116910}{116993}I understand.
{118534}{118547}I'm sorry.
{118553}{118627}It's all right.|They'll love it.
{118906}{118948}How are we going|to do the thing
{118954}{119042}without|those 2 girls?
{119414}{119442}I called for them|3 or 4 times.
{119448}{119509}Danny, have you seen|my pills anywhere?
{119515}{119530}I've lost my pills.
{119536}{119567}I don't know|where your pills are.
{119573}{119607}Oh, come on.
{119613}{119646}Shit.
{119652}{119687}Don't worry|about the pills.
{119693}{119730}I can't play|without the pills.
{119736}{119789}Of course you can play|without the pills.
{119795}{119848}The pills have no effect|on you whatsoever.
{119854}{119929}I found them.
{120142}{120218}Would you still love me|if I couldn't play?
{120234}{120240}What?
{120246}{120305}Would you still love me|if I couldn't play?
{120311}{120355}You wouldn't be you|if you couldn't play.
{120361}{120419}No, I want to know.
{120425}{120479}Our bodies|sway to music.
{120485}{120560}Oh, brightening|glance...
{120584}{120626}how can we know...
{120632}{120691}the dancer|from the dance?
{120774}{120828}But don't you wish sometimes|that you couldn't play,
{120834}{120876}that you could|just be ordinary?
{120882}{120931}Like what?|Live in the country?
{120937}{120963}Making bread?
{120969}{121007}Feeding chickens?
{121013}{121079}Playing once a year with|a bunch of amateurs?
{121086}{121130}How dare you insult|my sister like that.
{121136}{121159}I wasn't insulting her.
{121165}{121207}Well, at least|she chose her life.
{121213}{121281}Not like you and me.|We're just trained freaks.
{121290}{121343}Look, let's just|get in the cab
{121349}{121431}and then talk about it.
{121466}{121555}I wasn't being rude.
{121964}{122065}Why didn't you tell us|you were coming?
{122266}{122353}Ha ha.
{127783}{127811}I can't get up.
{127817}{127831}What?
{127837}{127928}I can't get up.
{128120}{128210}Give it to me.
{128955}{129040}Danny.
{129046}{129106}I've got|a fatal illness.
{129112}{129133}But you mustn't worry,
{129139}{129226}'cause I've got it|very mildly.
{129274}{129352}Hmm.
{129361}{129416}Look, uh...
{129422}{129469}what if she|won't see you?
{129475}{129520}Of course she'll see me.
{129526}{129601}I'm her sister.
{129801}{129870}I'm so relieved|that it's only M.S.
{129876}{129896}I know it's serious,
{129902}{129982}but I thought I was|going mad.
{130022}{130109}Hello, Jacks.
{130153}{130225}It's good to see you.
{130231}{130318}Hilary.
{130414}{130446}Ha ha.
{130452}{130473}Oh.
{130479}{130499}My sister here|will tell you.
{130505}{130555}This country bumpkin here|is my sister.
{130561}{130627}This is dame Margot Fonteyn.|She's a friend of mine.
{130633}{130679}It's an honour to meet you,|dame Margot.
{130685}{130714}Oh, please.
{130720}{130747}My sister will tell you
{130753}{130815}I was behaving|in the strangest way.
{130854}{130896}But, you know,|all that's happening
{130902}{130959}is that my nerve-endings|are damaged or something.
{130982}{131044}And I might have to go|into a wheelchair.
{131063}{131069}Oh, no.
{131075}{131105}But not for ages.|It takes years.
{131111}{131155}And it happens|in fits and starts.
{131161}{131224}And they're on the brink|of a cure anyway.
{131251}{131295}Well, who'll look|after you, then?
{131301}{131360}It's just Danny's so busy,|isn't he?
{131369}{131415}And, well,|the flat's all wrong.
{131421}{131448}Kif and I have|talked about it...
{131454}{131529}dame Margot has very kindly|offered to lend me her flat.
{131548}{131586}You see,|it's in Kensington.
{131592}{131670}I can't really be hidden|away in the country, can I?
{131676}{131732}Hilary keeps chickens.|She used to be a musician,
{131738}{131791}but now it's all chickens|and children, isn't it?
{131797}{131848}I would so like|to have had children.
{131854}{131888}Hilary's got heaps of them.
{131894}{131964}In fact, if you want to|get yourself impregnated,
{131970}{131988}you should ask her hubby.
{131994}{132066}He's extremely fertile,|and if you ask her nicely,
{132072}{132156}she'll lend him to you.
{132245}{132270}She's never been|quite right
{132276}{132348}since she went to|Russia. I think...
{132354}{132370}do be quiet, Derek.
{132376}{132478}You don't think this means|she'll have to stop playing?
{132505}{132573}No. Of course not.
{132579}{132613}Bye, daddy.
{132619}{132682}Bye-bye.
{132737}{132756}This is all frightful,
{132762}{132819}but it's better|than going bonkers.
{132825}{132924}I was sure|she was going bonkers.
{133447}{133487}Ok. Want to do|this one again?
{133493}{133586}Yeah.|Careful, careful.
{133598}{133636}Oh, my god.
{133642}{133687}And... very good.
{133693}{133708}Shut up.
{133714}{133797}That's good. It's good.|It is good.
{133850}{133954}I'm going|to fall off.
{134023}{134065}I got offered|a job today.
{134071}{134156}I thought you|already had a job.
{134195}{134211}Move over.
{134217}{134262}I can't move over.
{134268}{134362}All right.|I'll move you over.
{134567}{134632}Ok.
{134810}{134867}Artistic director
{134873}{134976}of the orchestre de Paris.
{135121}{135192}Oh.
{135198}{135277}Oh.
{135283}{135371}In many ways,|it would be better than now.
{135377}{135418}You know I'd always|be in one place.
{135424}{135506}Not in Manchester one night|and Chicago the next, you know?
{135512}{135597}You're always|in the same place.
{135625}{135698}Yes.
{135704}{135749}Paris.
{135755}{135797}I know.
{135803}{135823}If it were London...
{135829}{135908}no, of course you should|do it. Of course.
{135914}{135936}Paris isn't that far.
{135942}{136012}You could come home|a lot.
{136140}{136163}We'll think about it.
{136169}{136239}It'll give me a chance|to practice my French.
{136245}{136285}I've been working|very hard
{136291}{136324}on my languages,|actually.
{136330}{136353}That's good.
{136359}{136410}Joder. Do you know|what that is?
{136416}{136463}I think so.
{136469}{136513}It's Spanish for fuck.
{136519}{136580}And putain,|that's French for fuck.
{136586}{136641}And fican, that's|German for fuck.
{136647}{136714}And quievare|is Italian for fuck.
{136720}{136752}And kamamayu...
{136758}{136830}do you know|what that is?
{136891}{136972}Swahili.
{138220}{138287}I just wondered how you|were getting on without him.
{138293}{138355}I'm not without him.|He comes home every weekend.
{138361}{138457}Anyway, it'll be easier once|I start playing properly again.
{138476}{138528}Besides,|I get heaps of visitors.
{138534}{138623}Look at all the flowers.
{138662}{138705}What's that?
{138711}{138753}Oh, that's|my new push chair.
{138759}{138811}But you don't need|a wheelchair yet.
{138817}{138879}Oh, I see. I suppose|if I ate differently
{138885}{138965}or I exercised more,|none of this would be happening.
{138974}{139000}It's all my fault,|is that it?
{139006}{139057}No. I was just surprised,|that's all.
{139063}{139109}Oh, it's all my fault.|It's all psychological.
{139115}{139184}If it's psychological,|it's your fault, mother.
{139190}{139212}I'm sure it's|nobody's fault.
{139218}{139328}Don't eat those cakes, daddy.|They're for my visitors.
{139387}{139468}Sorry, Jacks.
{140023}{140088}Am I a cello genius?
{140094}{140170}You know you are.
{140191}{140281}Danny, I just want|to play again.
{140337}{140372}I'll play|the fucking triangle.
{140378}{140462}I just want to make|music again.
{140468}{140502}Ok.
{140508}{140599}Leave it with me.
{141671}{141748}Oh, my goodness,|it's me.
{143430}{143451}Teaching
{143457}{143531}can be just as rewarding|as playing in its own way.
{143543}{143567}Don't you think?
{143573}{143584}What?
{143590}{143663}I said teaching can be|as rewarding as playing
{143676}{143702}in its own way.
{143708}{143738}Where's Hilary?
{143744}{143802}She had to leave early.|It's a long drive.
{143808}{143838}I want Hilary.
{143844}{143858}Right.
{143864}{143932}I'll go and see|if the car's here.
{143942}{144005}Margaret, the flowers.
{144065}{144142}Danny.
{144182}{144195}Mm-hmm?
{144201}{144280}I think|my hearing's going.
{144621}{144693}Very brave of her|when you think about it.
{144699}{144721}Can't so much|as bang a drum
{144727}{144769}unless the whole world's|looking at her.
{144775}{144837}I'm sorry. I think we|ought to go and see her.
{144843}{144901}If we go back now,|it'll be quieter.
{144907}{144948}I'd like to see her.
{144954}{144982}I wish you would|go and see her.
{144988}{145040}You haven't been to see|her in such a long time.
{145046}{145079}She'll have|heaps of visitors,
{145085}{145141}and she doesn't|want to see me.
{145147}{145183}She seemed so unhappy.
{145189}{145233}Well, mother, that is|hardly surprising.
{145239}{145331}But she was happy.|And now she says she wasn't.
{145340}{145417}I thought if you could|show her this...
{145499}{145522}what for?
{145528}{145566}Well, as evidence.
{145572}{145650}It might remind her.
{145746}{145818}Mummy, everyone smiles|for photographs.
{146766}{146799}Hello, Danny?
{146805}{146878}Hi. How are you?
{146884}{146937}Great.
{146943}{146984}I'm missing you.
{146990}{147076}Listen, I won't be able|to get home this weekend.
{147104}{147157}Mahler...
{147163}{147248}I've always hated Mahler.|Now I hate him more.
{147254}{147308}Perhaps next week|I'll get home.
{147314}{147380}I hope so.
{147386}{147412}What was that?
{147418}{147453}What?
{147459}{147486}I heard a noise.
{147492}{147557}What sort of noise?
{147676}{147698}It was nothing.
{147704}{147778}It's probably my hearing|playing up again.
{147784}{147859}It sounded like|a baby crying.
{147868}{147909}I see.
{147915}{147988}It must be my hearing|playing up again,
{147994}{148076}wasn't it?
{148134}{148224}I'll call you later.
{148350}{148432}You bastard.
{148943}{148997}Where's Hilary?
{149003}{149044}She's...
{149050}{149081}the children|have got a virus,
{149087}{149173}and they didn't want|you to catch it.
{149184}{149247}Typical.
{149291}{149342}When...
{149348}{149419}you play...
{149425}{149472}everyone...
{149478}{149539}loves you.
{149545}{149627}When you stop...
{149633}{149677}you're alone.
{149683}{149773}I'm sure it's not quite|that bad, Jacks.
{149792}{149870}Unh. Look at this.
{149876}{149961}Music and movement.
{150018}{150039}Oh...
{150045}{150110}oh, for heaven's sake,
{150116}{150202}stop crying.
{153201}{153250}I don't understand|what she wants.
{153256}{153332}I think she's in|some sort of pain.
{153401}{153482}There are things you want|to say. I can see that.
{153488}{153584}But you cannot say them.|We cannot understand them.
{153595}{153661}But there is someone|who hears your thoughts.
{153667}{153718}Do not worry.|God hears them all.
{153724}{153771}He hears|your every thought.
{153777}{153861}Aah!
{154049}{154065}Yes?
{154071}{154150}Uh, it's Hilary.|Jacqueline's sister.
{154178}{154195}Oh, I see.
{154201}{154261}This is|my brother Piers.
{154267}{154320}Hello.
{154326}{154394}Isn't this|shocking weather?
{154400}{154454}Yes.
{154460}{154536}Well,|where's she going?
{155400}{155425}We can't get|anything down her.
{155431}{155518}I've been trying|for days.
{155701}{155788}May I try?
{156247}{156343}Shh, shh, shh.|It's Hilary.
{156410}{156446}That's it.
{156452}{156500}Up we go.
{156506}{156525}Come on.
{156531}{156618}There. Good.
{156784}{156841}Thought you|weren't watching.
{156847}{156957}Come on.
{157053}{157142}Pbltlllt!
{157148}{157246}Still in there|somewhere, Jacks?
{157350}{157459}Come on.
{157477}{157495}Hmm?
{157501}{157595}Still in there|somewhere?
{157751}{157855}Good girl.
{157946}{158037}Good girl.
{158067}{158097}When you love someone,
{158103}{158172}you find that pictures|of them stay with you
{158178}{158209}all the time|in your heart.
{158215}{158264}Pictures of the way|you think of them
{158270}{158306}when you think of them.
{158312}{158352}With mummy,|it's that day
{158358}{158404}you broke the drum|at the BBC.
{158410}{158484}Whenever you think|you've lost that person,
{158490}{158530}you start|with a picture
{158536}{158587}and then you|find them again.
{158593}{158640}You want to know|what I think of
{158646}{158684}when I think of you?
{158690}{158777}When people say|Jacqueline Du Pré to me,
{158790}{158850}I think of|a day on a beach
{158856}{158883}a long time ago.
{158889}{158957}Long before you|played the cello.
{158963}{159041}Before that|Jacqueline Du Pré
{159047}{159103}or this one.
{159116}{159204}And we were|playing a game.
{159240}{159298}When I was but...
{159304}{159359}13 or so...
{159365}{159437}I went into|a golden land.
{159451}{159547}Cimbarozo Cotopaxi|took me by the hand,
{159610}{159664}over the Orinoco...
{159670}{159722}across the blazing|Kalahari desert
{159728}{159795}through the untamed|grasslands of the veldt,
{159801}{159875}over the steppes...
{159881}{159949}and home.
{159980}{160079}Do you remember what you|said to me that day, Jackie?
{160136}{160228}You said that everything|was going to be all right.
{160393}{160477}And in the end, it was.
{160880}{160934}Hundreds|of roads are blocked,
{160940}{161001}and large parts of the rail|network are out of action.
{161007}{161074}The home secretary is chairing|an emergency meeting
{161080}{161145}to discuss ways of dealing|with the emergency.
{161151}{161268}The cellist Jacqueline Du Pré|has died at her London home.
{161274}{161361}She was 42.|Jacqueline Du Pré...
{161367}{161404}oh, god.
{161410}{161443}And won several awards
{161449}{161507}before rising to the top|of her profession.
{161513}{161543}She will be|particularly remembered
{161549}{161667}for her performances of|Elgar's cello concerto.
{161709}{161747}Stop the car, Piers.
{161753}{161838}Stop the car!
{162070}{162151}Oh, god!
{162167}{162250}Jackie!
{162292}{162381}Hil, where are you going?
{162538}{162616}When I was but 13 or so,
{162622}{162695}I went into a golden land.
{162701}{162794}Cimbarozo Cotopaxi|took me by the hand...
{162845}{162905}over the Orinoco...
{162911}{162976}across the blazing|Kalahari desert...
{162982}{163067}through the untamed|grasslands of the veldt...
{163101}{163158}over the steppes...
{163164}{163244}and home.
{163554}{163586}What do you want?
{163592}{163670}Nothing.|Just to see you.
{163699}{163740}Bye.
{163746}{163811}Jackie.
{163844}{163866}I just wanted|to tell you
{163872}{163944}that everything is|going to be all right.
