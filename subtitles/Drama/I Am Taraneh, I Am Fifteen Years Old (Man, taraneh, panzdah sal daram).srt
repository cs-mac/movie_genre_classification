<i>[Final Episode]</i>

3
00:01:09,019 --> 00:01:12,548
There's a clear contrast
between the green and white parts.

4
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:14,679
Looks good. I'll take these.

5
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,619
Goodness, people will think
you're choosing precious gems.

6
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,699
You examined these green onions
for a solid ten minutes.

7
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,340
My grocery shopping skills
are being tested!

8
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,489
Hey look, what are you doing on the road?

9
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,468
Hey look, what are you doing...

10
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:38,765
Hey, what are you doing?

11
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:41,734
Hey, hey! You can't turn on
the heat that high.

12
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,318
Stop. That's right. It's right there.

13
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,779
Dried radish slices need to be cooked
in low heat like that.

14
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,499
How many minutes has it been?

15
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,718
Four minutes now.

16
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,408
Sauté it for 20 minutes exactly.

17
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:57,988
If you go over by even one second,
it won't taste right.

18
00:01:57,989 --> 00:01:59,979
I got it.

19
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,928
If Hyun Suk finds out I taught you
the secret sauce recipe...

20
00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:05,006
Hyun Suk will probably say something.

21
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,210
Hyun Suk told me to never share it
with anyone.

22
00:02:12,009 --> 00:02:15,418
Am I just anyone?

23
00:02:15,419 --> 00:02:19,098
That's why I'm teaching you in secret.

24
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:21,138
Oh, I need to leave for the audition.

25
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:24,348
At 2:00, fry the tempura
and throw away the leftover oil.

26
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:26,598
You know we never re-use oil, right?

27
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:29,149
You sound like a broken record,
President Yang.

28
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,999
Your Grandma's secret sauce isn't the
only reason this place is successful.

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,638
It's all because it was combined
with my business philosophy.

30
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:38,258
You'll be late to the audition.

31
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:42,128
This time, I'll make sure to get
a regular role.

32
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:44,810
- I'll head out now.
- Fighting!

<i>[You & Now Project]</i>

Finding Lost Time...]</i>

35
00:03:16,409 --> 00:03:18,139
Ha No Ra.

36
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,027
Books and now newspapers...

37
00:03:22,028 --> 00:03:24,955
At this rate, you'll get your doctorate
by studying on your own.

38
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,718
Today's lesson was on the secret sauce?

39
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:28,769
Yeah.

40
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,978
Don't get me started.
Yang Dong Chul is so picky.

41
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:33,899
He chides me constantly.

42
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,378
Dong Chul went to the audition?

43
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:37,818
This time, it's a drama.

44
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:40,559
Yang Dong Chul, who decided to go after
his dream.

45
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,339
I thought he'd regret giving it up.
He's pretty impressive.

46
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,168
Regret? No, he says it's getting more fun.

47
00:03:47,169 --> 00:03:50,469
What about you?
You don't regret dropping out of college?

48
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:55,979
Not at all. Learning my Grandma's cooking
is so much fun.

49
00:03:57,189 --> 00:04:00,369
You're crazy. You're crazy!
Why would you quit school?

50
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,628
Even when you knew you were misdiagnosed,
you wanted to stay in school so bad.

51
00:04:03,629 --> 00:04:05,628
Why did you drop out of college?

52
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:09,157
Back then, I thought I was going to die.

53
00:04:09,158 --> 00:04:11,908
So I just wanted to do things
I never got to do.

54
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:13,239
Then what about now?

55
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,519
Going to college is now something
you don't want to do?

56
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,359
It's not that I don't want to do it.

57
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,208
I just didn't have any reasons
to keep going.

58
00:04:22,209 --> 00:04:23,490
Do you want to see this?

59
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:29,388
For four years, the tuition and textbooks
will cost more than 30 million won.

60
00:04:29,389 --> 00:04:33,299
When you add meals and spending money,
it'll be 50 million won.

61
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,198
And if I work those four years instead

62
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,409
I'll be able to make
at least 100 million won.

63
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,328
Is it about money?

64
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:44,338
There's some money left after you
paid for your place, right?

65
00:04:44,339 --> 00:04:49,519
I'm quitting because there's no reason for
me to spend that money to go to college.

66
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,049
I went to college
because of Min Soo's Dad.

67
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:57,029
And I went into the Humanities Department
because of him too.

68
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,549
But I'm not interested in any
of the majors in Humanities.

69
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,239
My interest was always dancing.

70
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,958
Studying was never my thing.

71
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:11,438
How many people go to college and
study because it's their thing?

72
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,419
Even getting a job, everyone does it
to keep up with each other's level.

73
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:19,088
Can you think it over one more time?
At least for Hyun Suk?

74
00:05:19,089 --> 00:05:24,159
Why do I have to get my college degree
to match Hyun Suk's level?

75
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,378
He's just so successful.

76
00:05:27,379 --> 00:05:29,369
It could look bad to others.

77
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:33,789
Living my life
by other people's standards...

78
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:35,619
I won't live like that anymore.

79
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,029
That's meaningless.

80
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:46,909
And as for Cha Hyun Suk,
I'm going to leave that as my first love.

81
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:51,278
Ha No Ra.
Are you sure you won't regret it?

82
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:55,169
I don't know if I'll regret it or not.

83
00:05:55,170 --> 00:06:00,648
But I don't want to depend on Hyun Suk,
or have him protect me.

84
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:03,438
I'll never find myself that way.

85
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:08,699
From now on, I'm only going to think about
ways I can live with my own strength.

86
00:06:11,089 --> 00:06:14,869
Will this be enough
for an elementary school kids' snack?

87
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,759
A little more.

88
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:22,749
I thought you can't have more than five
even with a god-given ballerina body?

89
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:26,018
What's with you today?
Buying spicy rice cakes for your students?

90
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,549
I was going to have some too.

91
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,878
I no longer have to watch my weight
like I did before.

92
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:33,779
Ever since I started working here,
you've been eating this way too often.

93
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:39,179
Oh, right, right. I'm so out of it.
I came here for business.

94
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,638
Business?

95
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,982
On Grandma's birthday this year,
you're going to Okcheon, right?

96
00:06:42,983 --> 00:06:44,201
Let's go together.

97
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:46,489
You want to go together?

98
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,809
Every time you go,
you have so many bags.

99
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,828
Until last year, you were able
to borrow Min Soo's Dad's car.

100
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:53,508
You have to take the bus this year, no?

101
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:56,789
I'll be able to get fresh air,
and say hello to Grandma.

102
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,419
Then, shall we?

103
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,910
I should prepare extra food.

104
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:06,588
Now that you mention it, that summer
in our junior year of high school

105
00:07:06,589 --> 00:07:10,079
practicing at your place in Okcheon
was our last trip.

106
00:07:15,341 --> 00:07:18,721
Cha Hyun Suk hasn't visited here,
has he?

107
00:07:19,644 --> 00:07:22,720
He's probably busy preparing for his show.

108
00:07:22,721 --> 00:07:26,021
That's not why he isn't coming.
That cold jerk.

109
00:07:27,302 --> 00:07:32,479
Dong Chul told him you're working here,
and he told him not to talk about you.

110
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,300
And not to talk about you in the future.

111
00:07:36,846 --> 00:07:39,357
Isn't he being too much?

112
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:41,917
What do you mean? It's only natural.

113
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:43,699
That's what we agreed on.

114
00:07:50,464 --> 00:07:52,286
Is that the best you can do?

115
00:07:55,254 --> 00:07:59,323
Expressing anger like that
isn't realistic.

116
00:07:59,324 --> 00:08:01,686
I'm supposed to be angry,
but you don't want me to show it?

117
00:08:01,687 --> 00:08:05,427
You gave up your dream of being an artist,
and haven't had a job for three years.

118
00:08:05,428 --> 00:08:08,958
The man who stole your girlfriend
is rubbing it in your face.

119
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,676
You want to let it all out,
but you have too much pride.

120
00:08:12,677 --> 00:08:15,486
So, you laugh instead of getting angry.

121
00:08:15,487 --> 00:08:18,778
Then the moment you turn around,
bang!

122
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:21,055
The anger that you
had suppressed explodes!

123
00:08:22,057 --> 00:08:23,978
And you rip that book.

124
00:08:25,317 --> 00:08:26,518
Try it again.

125
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:27,886
It's too hard.

126
00:08:27,887 --> 00:08:30,244
Do you think expressing two emotions
is easy?

127
00:08:30,245 --> 00:08:32,897
Okay, let's go again.

128
00:08:34,153 --> 00:08:35,836
Food is here!

129
00:08:38,066 --> 00:08:40,543
You have to come in quietly
during rehearsals.

130
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:45,776
I... I... I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

131
00:08:45,777 --> 00:08:47,556
Na Soon Nam wants us to take a break.

132
00:08:47,557 --> 00:08:49,960
Why don't we take eat and take a break?

133
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:52,301
Rookie, how is the job?

134
00:08:52,302 --> 00:08:57,163
Besides Producer Cha yelling
every now and then, everything is good.

135
00:08:58,123 --> 00:08:59,579
Endure it a little longer.

136
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,066
I won't be yelling for much longer.

137
00:09:02,101 --> 00:09:06,652
By the way Producer Cha, you used to
buy spicy rice cakes before.

138
00:09:06,653 --> 00:09:09,282
That really tasty spicy rice cake.

139
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:12,193
Why haven't we seen it lately?

140
00:09:14,613 --> 00:09:16,621
Because I don't want to eat it.

141
00:09:30,274 --> 00:09:32,053
<i>[Nina by Luise Rinser]</i>

142
00:09:52,086 --> 00:09:53,551
It's been a long...

143
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,028
Did he pretend not to know me?

144
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:08,773
<i>But you should know this one thing.</i>

145
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,473
<i>There is no forever.</i>

146
00:10:10,474 --> 00:10:12,413
It's time for me to move on now.

147
00:10:13,802 --> 00:10:18,230
<i>I can't hold onto dreams
of my first love forever.</i>

148
00:10:18,231 --> 00:10:20,173
I can't live my life that way.

149
00:10:45,994 --> 00:10:50,032
<i>I want to a reggae party yesterday.
It was so much fun!</i>

150
00:10:51,003 --> 00:10:54,591
A reggae party? That must've been fun.

151
00:10:54,592 --> 00:10:57,244
What were you doing, Mom?
You are doing well, right?

152
00:10:57,245 --> 00:11:02,394
Yes. I was eating rice and
reading the letter you wrote.

153
00:11:03,052 --> 00:11:05,652
What about the work? Isn't it hard?

154
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,298
It's not too bad.

155
00:11:09,299 --> 00:11:13,409
Once I finish at the blueberry farm,
I'm going to Hillstone to look for work.

156
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:16,939
If it's too difficult, you can come back.

157
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,479
<i>No way! I'm going to finish out the year.</i>

158
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,119
<i>I'm so glad I came, Mom.</i>

159
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,359
<i>I've met people from all over the world,
and made some money.</i>

160
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,460
<i>I feel like my mind is expanding.</i>

161
00:11:28,086 --> 00:11:31,035
I'm relieved. You're amazing.

162
00:11:31,738 --> 00:11:34,548
<i>I have to go somewhere now.
I'll call you again, okay?</i>

163
00:11:34,972 --> 00:11:38,347
Okay, take care of yourself. Be well.

164
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:49,462
My Min Soo is all grown up now.

165
00:12:16,638 --> 00:12:18,120
<i>[Writing Down Today's Joys]</i>

166
00:12:42,643 --> 00:12:44,019
It's been a long...

167
00:12:57,755 --> 00:13:00,081
<i>[Dear Mom...]</i>

168
00:13:17,572 --> 00:13:20,441
<i>To the person I wanted to watch over...</i>

169
00:13:20,442 --> 00:13:22,614
You said you wanted to watch over me.

170
00:13:30,514 --> 00:13:32,888
Oh, Yoon Young. Are you here?

171
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:35,930
<i>No Ra, I'm so sorry.</i>

172
00:13:35,931 --> 00:13:39,551
<i>I totally forgot that my mom has an
appointment at 9:00 at the hospital.</i>

173
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,339
Really?

174
00:13:41,729 --> 00:13:43,513
<i>Go on the bus without me.</i>

175
00:13:43,514 --> 00:13:47,471
<i>Since you have lots to carry,
leave it all at the Okcheon Terminal.</i>

176
00:13:47,472 --> 00:13:49,754
<i>Head up to the house first
and start cleaning.</i>

177
00:14:11,413 --> 00:14:12,775
Hey, Ha No Ra.

178
00:14:17,101 --> 00:14:18,530
So it is you, Ha No Ra.

179
00:14:19,368 --> 00:14:20,561
Yeah.

180
00:14:21,022 --> 00:14:22,081
Get in.

181
00:14:23,312 --> 00:14:25,150
Get in. I'll give you a ride.

182
00:14:26,395 --> 00:14:28,811
You don't even know where I'm going.

183
00:14:28,812 --> 00:14:30,543
You have a mountain of stuff to carry.

184
00:14:31,081 --> 00:14:32,810
I can take a taxi.

185
00:14:32,811 --> 00:14:34,591
Really? Okay.

186
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,827
Are you going to Okcheon, by chance?

187
00:14:52,828 --> 00:14:56,306
Grandma passed away in April,
so why are you going now?

188
00:14:56,307 --> 00:14:58,915
It's Grandma's birthday.

189
00:14:58,916 --> 00:14:59,953
Really?

190
00:15:01,653 --> 00:15:03,782
Then I'll give you a ride
to the bus terminal.

191
00:15:03,783 --> 00:15:05,830
Forget it.

192
00:15:05,831 --> 00:15:08,254
I'm only doing it because
you're going to see your grandma.

193
00:15:20,932 --> 00:15:22,110
Get in.

194
00:15:27,489 --> 00:15:30,699
Hello? Hi, Reporter Kim.

195
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,451
Sorry for getting back to you so late.

196
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:34,830
Yes.

197
00:15:34,831 --> 00:15:38,845
<i>It's been thirty minutes, but he hasn't
asked me how I've been doing.</i>

198
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:44,379
Hey! You said you're letting me off
at the bus terminal.

199
00:15:45,948 --> 00:15:49,099
I've done too many interviews.
I'll do one after the show.

200
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:50,908
Okay.

201
00:15:51,547 --> 00:15:53,767
Why are you going this way?

202
00:15:53,768 --> 00:15:57,638
I happen to have the day off,
so I might as well go to Okcheon.

203
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:59,460
You're going all the way to Okcheon?

204
00:15:59,461 --> 00:16:03,888
Forget it! I'm supposed to meet Yoon Young
at the Okcheon bus terminal.

205
00:16:03,889 --> 00:16:05,649
Yeah, I'll go to the bus terminal there.

206
00:16:06,533 --> 00:16:09,269
Why would you go all the way to Okcheon?

207
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,899
Do you think it's because of you?

208
00:16:12,437 --> 00:16:14,845
I'm going because you said
it's Grandma's birthday.

209
00:16:14,846 --> 00:16:17,538
Because you have food for Grandma.

210
00:16:18,346 --> 00:16:20,898
I do have some stake in Grandma, you know.

211
00:16:21,557 --> 00:16:24,255
Still, it's a burden.

212
00:16:24,256 --> 00:16:25,826
Why am I a burden?

213
00:16:27,837 --> 00:16:31,306
Why are you feeling so uncomfortable?
The whole first love thing is over with.

214
00:16:31,307 --> 00:16:33,656
Just think of it as meeting
your high school classmate.

215
00:16:33,657 --> 00:16:37,100
I don't need it. Turn the car around.

216
00:16:40,376 --> 00:16:41,696
Yeah, Yoon Young.

217
00:16:41,697 --> 00:16:45,806
<i>My mom needs to get a blood test
and a few other tests too.</i>

218
00:16:45,807 --> 00:16:49,365
<i>What should I do?
How will you get up the mountain alone?</i>

219
00:16:50,756 --> 00:16:52,293
Oh, really?

220
00:16:52,294 --> 00:16:54,165
I'll handle it.

221
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,905
Help your mom.

222
00:16:56,346 --> 00:16:57,520
Okay.

223
00:16:58,076 --> 00:17:03,384
Gosh, looks like I'll be going to Okcheon
mountain, not just the bus terminal.

224
00:17:24,678 --> 00:17:27,238
Thank you. You should go.

225
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:29,720
I should say my greetings to Grandma
before I go.

226
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:34,239
Why is this rice uncooked?

227
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,857
I always come here and cook it.

228
00:17:37,858 --> 00:17:40,587
Then go ahead and say hello
to your grandma.

229
00:17:40,588 --> 00:17:43,020
If you're going to cook here,
we need to clean this place up.

230
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:45,545
Where's the broom again?

231
00:17:58,923 --> 00:18:05,248
Grandma, I did go to college
with the money that you saved for me.

232
00:18:05,249 --> 00:18:07,246
But, I quit.

233
00:18:07,247 --> 00:18:12,829
There just wasn't anything more
that I wanted to learn there.

234
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:16,620
Your granddaughter is so smart.

235
00:18:16,621 --> 00:18:19,769
So I learned everything that I needed.

236
00:18:22,607 --> 00:18:25,618
It's all thanks to you, Seo Woon Hae.

237
00:18:26,404 --> 00:18:29,862
Thank you for being born as my grandma.

238
00:18:31,051 --> 00:18:32,659
Seo Woon Hae...

239
00:18:33,431 --> 00:18:37,557
Thank you so much for loving me.

240
00:18:40,617 --> 00:18:45,825
By the way, Grandma, don't you think
Cha Hyun Suk is being too much?

241
00:18:45,826 --> 00:18:47,036
Let's switch.

242
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:51,854
It's my turn now.

243
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:54,095
Are you going to cut the weeds?

244
00:18:54,096 --> 00:18:55,657
Go on and cook.

245
00:18:56,257 --> 00:18:58,516
Okay. Thanks.

246
00:19:20,498 --> 00:19:23,227
He went on and on about being
first loves, and 20 years.

247
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:26,478
How could he change like that
in just three months?

248
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:28,779
He was so kind in high school.

249
00:19:32,109 --> 00:19:35,983
Don't you want to do it just the way
we made it without the teachers knowing?

250
00:19:37,223 --> 00:19:40,033
This is the first show we're doing
in front of the public.

251
00:19:40,034 --> 00:19:42,883
Let's take a short break.

252
00:19:42,884 --> 00:19:44,763
I think I'm going to die now.

253
00:19:45,582 --> 00:19:48,482
Okay, let's take a break.
I'll bring the watermelon.

254
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,307
Watermelon.

255
00:19:53,107 --> 00:19:54,441
Hey!

256
00:20:04,093 --> 00:20:06,612
<i>Don't feel down even if the teachers
say something to you.</i>

257
00:20:06,613 --> 00:20:08,269
<i>It's because you're like Seo Taiji.</i>

258
00:20:08,747 --> 00:20:09,884
Seo Taiji?

259
00:20:10,556 --> 00:20:15,673
In about 20 years, you're going to be
the top producer in Korea.

260
00:20:17,501 --> 00:20:18,681
Don't say nonsense.

261
00:20:18,682 --> 00:20:20,232
I mean it though.

262
00:20:20,233 --> 00:20:22,843
I knew that Seo Taiji and Boys
would be a big hit.

263
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:29,711
What are you going to do
if I'm not successful in 20 years?

264
00:20:29,712 --> 00:20:31,413
And what if you are?

265
00:20:32,644 --> 00:20:33,875
Never mind.

266
00:20:34,586 --> 00:20:36,019
You want to make a bet?

267
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,263
A bet?

268
00:20:37,574 --> 00:20:41,492
We'll bury a time capsule,
and check it in 20 years.

269
00:20:41,493 --> 00:20:43,022
Time capsule?

270
00:20:53,198 --> 00:20:54,860
<i>You were the only one.</i>

271
00:20:54,861 --> 00:20:59,804
<i>The only one who saw that an odd and
sensitive kid like me had talent.</i>

272
00:20:59,805 --> 00:21:01,201
<i>The only one to believe in me.</i>

273
00:21:01,532 --> 00:21:02,741
You were the only one.

274
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:08,645
You were the one
who made me who I am today.

275
00:21:08,646 --> 00:21:11,518
I don't know what you're talking about.

276
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:14,775
When did I do that?

277
00:21:16,635 --> 00:21:18,576
You don't even remember?

278
00:21:19,426 --> 00:21:22,627
Ah... this was it.

279
00:21:23,932 --> 00:21:27,738
Hyun Suk remembered it all.

280
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:41,221
<i>Year 2015, Cha Hyun Suk will have become
the best producer in Korea.</i>

281
00:21:41,222 --> 00:21:44,421
<i>July 30, 1995.</i>

282
00:21:44,422 --> 00:21:46,023
<i>Ha No Ra.</i>

283
00:22:25,287 --> 00:22:26,546
What are you doing?

284
00:22:27,342 --> 00:22:30,661
I don't want to forget where it is
when I come back later.

285
00:22:30,662 --> 00:22:32,405
We'll be back together.

286
00:22:32,406 --> 00:22:35,578
This has been my playground for 11 years,
since I was five years old.

287
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:40,238
That's true. We'll come together.

288
00:22:41,343 --> 00:22:42,898
Don't forget.

289
00:23:07,951 --> 00:23:09,738
You have to go to your right.

290
00:23:12,346 --> 00:23:15,031
You said it's been your playground
for 11 years.

291
00:23:15,032 --> 00:23:16,889
But you forgot?

292
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,277
To the right?

293
00:23:24,337 --> 00:23:27,770
I don't know exactly where it is.

294
00:23:27,771 --> 00:23:29,362
Three steps forward.

295
00:23:42,258 --> 00:23:43,582
Now I know.

296
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,981
Cha Hyun Suk.

297
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,852
You remembered it.

298
00:23:51,853 --> 00:23:53,415
The time capsule?

299
00:23:56,259 --> 00:23:58,650
Don't you want to see it with me?

300
00:23:58,651 --> 00:24:00,162
I don't want to see it.

301
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:04,116
You can see it all... both of them.

302
00:25:05,721 --> 00:25:08,392
<i>Year 2015, to Ha No Ra
who is now 38 years old.</i>

303
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:11,638
<i>I see you're still the same.</i>

304
00:25:12,416 --> 00:25:16,150
<i>You're still bright,
energetic, and pretty.</i>

305
00:25:17,413 --> 00:25:20,910
<i>July 30, 1995. 20 years ago.</i>

306
00:25:21,818 --> 00:25:22,989
<i>Ha No Ra...</i>

307
00:25:24,058 --> 00:25:28,159
<i>I've been happy having you by my side
for 20 years, and thank you.</i>

308
00:25:29,141 --> 00:25:31,030
<i>Let's continue being happy.</i>

309
00:25:32,301 --> 00:25:36,712
<i>From Cha Hyun Suk,
who always wants to be next to Ha No Ra.</i>

<i>July 30, 1995.</i>

312
00:26:09,915 --> 00:26:11,935
<i>From...
The one who is keeping an eye on you.</i>

313
00:26:13,317 --> 00:26:16,143
The one who is keeping an eye on you?

314
00:26:16,144 --> 00:26:18,685
<i>To the person who I hoped
to keep an eye on.</i>

315
00:26:22,854 --> 00:26:25,303
<i>To the person who I hoped
to keep an eye on.</i>

316
00:26:27,273 --> 00:26:29,053
<i>The one who is keeping an eye on you.</i>

317
00:26:46,166 --> 00:26:47,451
Cha Hyun Suk.

318
00:26:50,865 --> 00:26:55,724
Had you... looked at this already?

319
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:02,096
Yes, I did.

320
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,086
When?

321
00:27:14,096 --> 00:27:15,226
Grandma.

322
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:18,626
I've been discharged from the army.

323
00:27:18,627 --> 00:27:20,393
No one is here in Korea.

324
00:27:21,355 --> 00:27:23,351
So I'm leaving straight for Russia.

325
00:27:23,989 --> 00:27:26,028
<i>I don't know when I'll be back again.</i>

326
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:30,938
<i>But... don't be too upset with No Ra.</i>

327
00:28:09,308 --> 00:28:14,797
<i>Year 2015, Cha Hyun Suk will have become
the best producer in Korea.</i>

328
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:17,622
<i>July 30, 1995.</i>

329
00:28:17,623 --> 00:28:19,690
<i>From...
The one who is keeping an eye on you.</i>

330
00:28:20,818 --> 00:28:23,147
The one who is keeping an eye on you...

331
00:28:27,621 --> 00:28:31,232
You came and the buried it again?

332
00:28:32,432 --> 00:28:35,874
Why didn't you throw it away?
Why did you bury it again?

333
00:28:38,433 --> 00:28:40,032
I don't know why.

334
00:28:41,942 --> 00:28:44,972
Maybe 20 years later, in 2015...

335
00:28:46,112 --> 00:28:48,321
I thought we'd come back here together.

336
00:28:51,303 --> 00:28:54,931
To me, you're that kind of person.

337
00:28:58,131 --> 00:28:59,323
I'm going now.

338
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:19,553
What does this mean?

339
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:24,976
Are you asking because you don't know?

340
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,378
Yes.

341
00:29:27,428 --> 00:29:30,679
We've never been the type to hug,
so I don't know what it means.

342
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:32,960
Tell me in words.

343
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:35,734
That assignment you gave...

344
00:29:37,093 --> 00:29:42,375
I think that one important moment
in my life is right now.

345
00:29:44,006 --> 00:29:45,826
I don't know what you mean.

346
00:29:47,855 --> 00:29:50,525
I only understand if you tell me directly.

347
00:29:51,814 --> 00:29:53,286
Like the last time.

348
00:29:57,375 --> 00:29:58,855
I don't want you...

349
00:30:01,214 --> 00:30:03,442
by my side anymore.

350
00:30:04,712 --> 00:30:06,070
I want you...

351
00:30:10,021 --> 00:30:12,981
to be by my side.

352
00:30:15,465 --> 00:30:16,622
Why?

353
00:30:17,766 --> 00:30:19,391
Because I like you.

354
00:30:20,461 --> 00:30:22,342
Because I missed you.

355
00:30:22,343 --> 00:30:24,420
Because I can't forget you.

356
00:30:26,886 --> 00:30:30,154
I thought I was going to die
because I wanted to see you.

357
00:30:36,518 --> 00:30:38,357
Tell me one more time.

358
00:30:39,885 --> 00:30:43,498
You haven't forgotten me, have you?

359
00:30:54,148 --> 00:30:55,681
How could I forget you?

360
00:30:56,471 --> 00:30:58,240
You jerk!

361
00:30:59,784 --> 00:31:00,858
What?

362
00:31:03,657 --> 00:31:04,963
What did you say?

363
00:31:04,964 --> 00:31:06,525
How could you...

364
00:32:04,578 --> 00:32:08,688
I always had a drink with Grandma
on her birthdays.

365
00:32:08,689 --> 00:32:11,605
Grandma always loved rice wine.

366
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:14,712
Don't use her as an excuse.

367
00:32:14,713 --> 00:32:18,353
You've been drinking rice wine since you
were six, getting drunk and dancing.

368
00:32:19,471 --> 00:32:21,010
How did you know that?

369
00:32:21,011 --> 00:32:22,722
You think that's all I know?

370
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:26,788
Do you know why Grandma likes
red bean paste bread?

371
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,039
Red bean paste bread?

372
00:32:29,904 --> 00:32:33,277
Long long ago, there was this old grandma.

373
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:36,325
One winter day, she had no food.
Not even a grain of rice.

374
00:32:36,326 --> 00:32:39,441
She went over the mountain to another town
to work on a farm.

375
00:32:39,442 --> 00:32:42,958
But they told her that they had
no money to pay her.

376
00:32:42,959 --> 00:32:46,716
And they gave her
one red bean paste bread.

377
00:32:46,717 --> 00:32:50,216
She took that bread and walked home
for two hours through a mountain path.

378
00:32:50,217 --> 00:32:52,414
She wanted so badly to eat it.

379
00:32:53,676 --> 00:32:55,688
But back home...

380
00:32:55,689 --> 00:33:00,500
that grandma had a five-year-old
granddaughter who had starved all day.

381
00:33:00,501 --> 00:33:05,991
So she endured her hunger, went home,
and gave that bread to her granddaughter.

382
00:33:05,992 --> 00:33:08,152
But she thought to herself

383
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:12,491
"Gosh, I hope she leaves me
one little piece."

384
00:33:15,886 --> 00:33:20,027
But, that granddaughter said to her,
"Grandma, ah..."

385
00:33:20,438 --> 00:33:22,932
A child that had been starving all day...

386
00:33:23,518 --> 00:33:27,659
held that bread out to Seo Woon Hae first
and told her to eat it.

387
00:33:29,363 --> 00:33:32,542
That's a story about my grandma?

388
00:33:33,268 --> 00:33:34,833
She told me that story.

389
00:33:35,207 --> 00:33:39,626
She said that even if you were not
related to her by blood

390
00:33:39,627 --> 00:33:41,607
you were a child that was impossible
not to love.

391
00:33:43,487 --> 00:33:47,517
That child's name was probably...
Ha No Ra.

392
00:33:49,856 --> 00:33:53,712
Grandma never told me that story.

393
00:33:54,917 --> 00:33:58,178
That's why she liked red bean paste bread.

394
00:34:00,478 --> 00:34:05,795
Grandma's the reason why I liked you
so deeply.

395
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,319
Why aren't you giving me any rice wine?

396
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,974
I should say cheers too.

397
00:34:16,648 --> 00:34:18,666
You have to drive.

398
00:34:20,344 --> 00:34:23,846
Grandma, No Ra has finally
come to her senses.

399
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,362
Are you saying I was crazy before?

400
00:34:27,804 --> 00:34:30,976
You made me wait three months
and ten days.

401
00:34:30,978 --> 00:34:32,480
What about you?

402
00:34:32,481 --> 00:34:35,267
How could you not come looking for me
even one time?

403
00:34:35,268 --> 00:34:36,935
Didn't you want to see me?

404
00:34:36,936 --> 00:34:38,980
Who says I didn't?

405
00:34:38,981 --> 00:34:40,003
Huh?

406
00:34:40,592 --> 00:34:43,840
And Ha No Ra, you came to see me
whenever you pleased.

407
00:34:45,023 --> 00:34:46,998
Did you miss me that much?

408
00:34:47,708 --> 00:34:50,442
You knew that I was watching?

409
00:34:50,443 --> 00:34:54,487
Yesterday, you ate three spicy rice cakes
when Dong Chul wasn't looking.

410
00:35:14,601 --> 00:35:17,911
Here it is. Ha No Ra's first batch
of spicy rice cakes.

411
00:35:28,644 --> 00:35:32,199
It's not the same as Grandma's,
but it's still very good.

412
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:34,387
It isn't easy.

413
00:36:00,148 --> 00:36:01,580
She dropped out?

414
00:36:01,581 --> 00:36:04,181
I'm telling you
because I thought you should know.

415
00:36:05,233 --> 00:36:10,372
Yesterday, she even came to the store
saying that she wants to learn from me.

416
00:36:10,373 --> 00:36:12,091
What should I do?

417
00:36:12,092 --> 00:36:17,290
From now on, don't tell No Ra
anything about me.

418
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:18,392
Ever...

419
00:36:18,393 --> 00:36:19,840
What does that mean?

420
00:36:19,842 --> 00:36:22,363
Are you really going to give up on No Ra?

421
00:36:22,364 --> 00:36:25,881
Instead, I want to know everything
about how No Ra is doing.

422
00:36:25,882 --> 00:36:28,210
So you're going to keep an eye on No Ra?

423
00:36:28,211 --> 00:36:30,690
I need to leave No Ra be for now.

424
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,241
Let No Ra do what she wants.

425
00:36:33,242 --> 00:36:37,313
What are you going to do
if No Ra never comes back to you?

426
00:36:38,681 --> 00:36:40,312
Then I can't do anything.

427
00:36:40,313 --> 00:36:41,721
You can't do anything?

428
00:36:41,722 --> 00:36:44,144
Hey Cha, how can you give up so easily?

429
00:36:45,043 --> 00:36:48,094
Does this look easy to you guys?

430
00:36:50,152 --> 00:36:53,502
Dong Chul and Yoon Young
were both in on it?

431
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:56,344
They weren't in on it.
They were doing me a favor.

432
00:36:58,253 --> 00:37:00,212
Why did you do it?

433
00:37:00,213 --> 00:37:04,611
I wanted to be someone who could
help you gain courage in life.

434
00:37:04,612 --> 00:37:07,292
That way you'd come to me on your own.

435
00:37:07,293 --> 00:37:11,062
Cha Hyun Suk... you are really mean.

436
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:14,736
I was waiting for you,
until you gained courage.

437
00:37:14,737 --> 00:37:16,988
Do you know how nervous I was?

438
00:37:16,989 --> 00:37:18,765
Were you nervous?

439
00:37:18,766 --> 00:37:21,877
You said you knew I was watching
you secretly.

440
00:37:21,878 --> 00:37:23,517
So why were you nervous?

441
00:37:23,518 --> 00:37:25,343
Because you were doing it secretly.

442
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:29,765
Watching me secretly meant it was not
serious enough for you to hold onto me.

443
00:37:29,766 --> 00:37:33,212
It meant your heart
wasn't quite there yet.

444
00:37:33,213 --> 00:37:36,253
It meant you didn't trust my feelings yet.

445
00:37:38,844 --> 00:37:40,492
I guess that was true.

446
00:37:41,063 --> 00:37:42,192
What?

447
00:37:43,163 --> 00:37:45,347
It was worth the wait, right?

448
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:50,550
You've become tougher
since the last time I saw you.

449
00:37:55,298 --> 00:37:58,680
Grandma, I'll be leaving now with No Ra.

450
00:37:58,681 --> 00:38:01,525
Next time, I'll be coming with her.

451
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:07,030
Why aren't you saying anything?
Grandma is waiting.

452
00:38:08,699 --> 00:38:12,039
You should say,
"I'll be back with Hyun Suk".

453
00:38:15,048 --> 00:38:19,518
Grandma, I'll be going now
and I'll be back.

454
00:38:20,268 --> 00:38:23,987
I'll see how Hyun Suk behaves,
and bring him back if he's good.

455
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:26,436
What?

456
00:38:51,255 --> 00:38:53,359
<i>[Yoobae University is just a
temporary stop for me.]</i>

457
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,289
<i>[Though I may be tested, I will not fail]</i>

458
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,311
<i>[One who overcome one's fault
is a strong person.]</i>

459
00:38:58,126 --> 00:39:00,027
<i>[Paper Due Date - 7 Days]</i>

460
00:39:00,405 --> 00:39:03,364
People say that mistakes can happen
once in a while.

461
00:39:05,447 --> 00:39:08,572
Kim Woo Chul will not fall like this.

462
00:39:20,893 --> 00:39:23,365
Narcissistic personality disorder.

463
00:39:23,367 --> 00:39:27,517
Those with this disorder believe
they are the most important person.

464
00:39:27,518 --> 00:39:30,750
And they overestimate their talents
and skills.

465
00:39:30,751 --> 00:39:35,138
So, they are very sensitive to the
perceptions of others, and obsess over it.

466
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:39,192
Another important point is that they
lack empathy towards others.

467
00:39:39,193 --> 00:39:41,120
They are solely focused on succeeding.

468
00:39:41,121 --> 00:39:45,230
They work hard to get attention and
respect from people around them.

469
00:39:45,231 --> 00:39:50,039
You will see impudent and rampant behavior
from them every now and then, as well.

470
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,391
Is there a treatment?

471
00:39:54,989 --> 00:39:57,610
The thing is... it's not easy to treat.

472
00:39:59,802 --> 00:40:02,000
The patient must come forward...

473
00:40:02,641 --> 00:40:05,850
and seek out treatment
for this narcissism.

474
00:40:05,851 --> 00:40:08,288
But there is another symptom
of this disorder.

475
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:14,333
They will never admit that they have
narcissistic personality disorder.

476
00:40:28,255 --> 00:40:30,927
I knew he'd be living like a loser.

477
00:40:35,985 --> 00:40:37,590
It's been a long time.

478
00:40:38,434 --> 00:40:39,853
Do I know you?

479
00:40:40,994 --> 00:40:42,793
What are you doing here like this?

480
00:40:43,099 --> 00:40:45,093
I said, do I know you?

481
00:40:45,094 --> 00:40:47,306
Yi Jin... Kim Yi Jin!

482
00:40:51,123 --> 00:40:53,094
You knew it was me?

483
00:40:53,847 --> 00:40:57,114
You're wearing the same disguise.

484
00:41:08,235 --> 00:41:12,571
You had to disguise yourself
when you were dating me.

485
00:41:12,572 --> 00:41:15,206
Even after breaking up,
you still have to do this.

486
00:41:16,327 --> 00:41:18,750
I really am a bad person.

487
00:41:18,751 --> 00:41:20,677
I'm relieved that you know.

488
00:41:21,914 --> 00:41:26,550
Can you just not endure
the anger towards me?

489
00:41:28,597 --> 00:41:32,098
It hasn't been easy for me to forget.

490
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:36,300
You didn't stop me from coming to Yoobae
University, so I thought you'd let it go.

491
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:41,934
Just hit me.

492
00:41:43,431 --> 00:41:47,217
Were you always this dense? Seriously...

493
00:41:52,851 --> 00:41:54,536
You're not possibly...

494
00:41:58,936 --> 00:42:01,025
Are you here by yourself?

495
00:42:02,391 --> 00:42:05,108
Yes, I've made a very clean break.

496
00:42:06,603 --> 00:42:08,012
I'm alone.

497
00:42:12,052 --> 00:42:14,211
You know I'm going to Yoobae University,
don't you?

498
00:42:15,474 --> 00:42:17,512
I heard from Min Soo.

499
00:42:18,472 --> 00:42:21,021
I thought I should say goodbye.

500
00:42:23,175 --> 00:42:24,271
Yes.

501
00:42:28,684 --> 00:42:30,693
Do you still hate me?

502
00:42:32,623 --> 00:42:36,603
I have no feelings towards you anymore.

503
00:42:40,494 --> 00:42:42,224
I was young back then.

504
00:42:42,833 --> 00:42:46,976
I thought about it,
and I was only 23 years old.

505
00:42:48,257 --> 00:42:51,944
I could only think about
hiding my mistakes.

506
00:42:51,945 --> 00:42:53,315
I was too young.

507
00:42:54,586 --> 00:42:56,724
I was scared of everything that happened.

508
00:42:57,902 --> 00:42:59,637
I thought because of one mistake...

509
00:43:00,909 --> 00:43:03,389
I might have ruined my life.

510
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:06,288
Now...

511
00:43:07,467 --> 00:43:09,490
it's all in the past.

512
00:43:10,086 --> 00:43:13,576
Don't look back.
Let's live looking forward.

513
00:43:13,577 --> 00:43:15,507
You and I both.

514
00:43:17,487 --> 00:43:18,547
Okay.

515
00:43:19,809 --> 00:43:21,699
If you're done...

516
00:43:29,697 --> 00:43:31,966
What is this?

517
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:34,766
When I brought you to dinner
with Professor Lindemann...

518
00:43:35,675 --> 00:43:37,786
I bought this to beg for forgiveness.

519
00:43:38,717 --> 00:43:43,200
The situation has changed,
but I did buy it to give it to you.

520
00:43:43,201 --> 00:43:45,347
So, I'd like you to accept it.

521
00:43:54,759 --> 00:43:57,353
Ah, I thought about taking the card out.

522
00:43:58,702 --> 00:44:01,478
But I wanted to say those words to you.
So I left it in there.

523
00:44:08,369 --> 00:44:13,021
<i>For the past 20 years...
Sorry, and thank you.</i>

524
00:44:17,262 --> 00:44:21,242
It's the first gift
I've received from you.

525
00:44:22,228 --> 00:44:23,806
I'll accept it.

526
00:44:24,565 --> 00:44:25,688
Okay.

527
00:44:28,887 --> 00:44:32,768
I want to say sorry again.

528
00:44:34,958 --> 00:44:36,148
And thank you.

529
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,539
The two of you were quite classy.

530
00:44:40,947 --> 00:44:45,959
It's not easy to level-headed
when breaking up.

531
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:48,928
It was a break up with no regrets.
That was why.

532
00:44:48,929 --> 00:44:54,938
You have to have some feelings left
in order to get angry.

533
00:44:56,635 --> 00:45:00,697
About before... I am very sorry.

534
00:45:02,528 --> 00:45:05,809
I'm the one who caused you
to do something you'd be sorry for.

535
00:45:07,378 --> 00:45:11,187
Being so indecisive,
holding on to two choices.

536
00:45:11,188 --> 00:45:14,335
I tried to turn everything to my advantage
and I was very wrong.

537
00:45:32,592 --> 00:45:35,647
Why are you giving this to me?

538
00:45:35,648 --> 00:45:37,968
You should eat it, Professor Kim.

539
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:41,230
Honestly, I don't like cutlass fish.

540
00:45:42,257 --> 00:45:46,328
Why didn't you ever say so?

541
00:45:46,329 --> 00:45:49,757
I didn't even know all this time,
and we ate it every week.

542
00:45:49,759 --> 00:45:53,349
It seemed like you liked it,
so I didn't say anything.

543
00:45:58,947 --> 00:46:01,188
How is Yoobae University?

544
00:46:01,677 --> 00:46:04,878
I'm starting from the beginning
and writing my paper.

545
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:09,188
I'm going get back to Seoul
with my skill alone.

546
00:46:12,248 --> 00:46:14,496
I resigned from Woocheon.

547
00:46:15,487 --> 00:46:18,781
Thanks to Producer Cha,
I could not have just stayed.

548
00:46:18,782 --> 00:46:22,509
What I did was definitely a crime.

549
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:24,510
After I did something like that...

550
00:46:25,083 --> 00:46:27,549
I shouldn't stand on the lecture platform.

551
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:30,210
Then what do you plan to do?

552
00:46:31,311 --> 00:46:33,308
I'm going to the United States next week.

553
00:46:33,309 --> 00:46:34,570
The United States?

554
00:46:35,509 --> 00:46:36,848
Are you going to study abroad?

555
00:46:36,849 --> 00:46:39,216
Oh no, not at all.

556
00:46:39,217 --> 00:46:41,187
I'm going on a vacation.

557
00:46:41,188 --> 00:46:43,310
For about a month.

558
00:46:43,311 --> 00:46:45,349
I want to gather my thoughts.

559
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:48,217
So you won't be gone forever.

560
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:51,735
I'm not quite sure why...

561
00:46:52,931 --> 00:46:57,221
But... I can't seem to leave Korea yet.

562
00:47:02,798 --> 00:47:05,239
Should we go eat red bean shaved ice
after we finish eating?

563
00:47:07,432 --> 00:47:10,559
You know, actually...

564
00:47:11,096 --> 00:47:13,505
I don't really like red beans.

565
00:47:13,507 --> 00:47:16,166
I only ate it because you like it.

566
00:47:19,882 --> 00:47:23,984
We were a couple that were quite
dishonest with each other.

567
00:47:23,985 --> 00:47:26,026
Let's not do that in the future.

568
00:47:26,027 --> 00:47:28,594
If we like it, say so.
If we don't like it, say so.

569
00:47:29,795 --> 00:47:31,375
Don't live hiding our feelings.

570
00:47:32,485 --> 00:47:37,085
Yes, let's do that.
I think being honest is best.

571
00:47:39,755 --> 00:47:42,625
There is a shaved ice with rice cake
and bean powder. Do you want that?

572
00:47:45,085 --> 00:47:46,148
All right.

573
00:48:31,206 --> 00:48:32,440
Looks pretty.

574
00:48:41,853 --> 00:48:43,395
Where is Soon Nam?

575
00:48:43,396 --> 00:48:45,737
We have to eat a simple dinner
and do the show.

576
00:48:47,454 --> 00:48:49,018
Food delivery is here.

577
00:48:49,322 --> 00:48:50,333
Ha No Ra!

578
00:48:51,932 --> 00:48:53,301
What's going on?

579
00:48:53,302 --> 00:48:56,250
There's spicy rice cakes, sandwiches,
and rice porridge.

580
00:48:56,251 --> 00:48:59,321
Those who can digest well can eat
spicy rice cake and sandwiches.

581
00:48:59,322 --> 00:49:02,751
Nervous people can have the porridge.

582
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:07,442
I told you that No Ra is tired,
and to keep her from doing these things.

583
00:49:07,443 --> 00:49:10,660
Out of the producer I work part-time for,
and my eternal Noona...

584
00:49:10,661 --> 00:49:12,343
who do you think I'd listen to?

585
00:49:12,344 --> 00:49:13,607
Bingo!

586
00:49:13,608 --> 00:49:14,666
Part-time?

587
00:49:15,186 --> 00:49:18,484
I heard you decided to work in
Production Planning now.

588
00:49:18,485 --> 00:49:21,274
Now tell me again,
is it me or your "Noona"?

589
00:49:21,275 --> 00:49:24,114
I'm going to start eating for now.

590
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,053
What? You said you were taking
the civil servant exam.

591
00:49:29,054 --> 00:49:31,973
Ever since I started your old job,
the production work has been fun.

592
00:49:31,974 --> 00:49:35,024
I also met many musical theater people
through Sang Ye.

593
00:49:35,025 --> 00:49:38,533
I may not be able to be a choreographer,
but I want to go into production planning.

594
00:49:38,534 --> 00:49:40,373
That's great!

595
00:49:40,375 --> 00:49:44,009
I was wondering how a dancer
could sit at a desk all day.

596
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:45,118
Good job.

597
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:48,067
Why are the two of you whispering
and leaving me out?

598
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:50,499
Na Soon Nam, you didn't answer.
Is it me or your "Noona"?

599
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:54,838
Noona, please help me out
with your boyfriend.

600
00:49:55,757 --> 00:49:57,228
Producer Cha.

601
00:49:59,188 --> 00:50:01,031
Go on and eat.

602
00:50:01,032 --> 00:50:04,399
I even made that porridge that you like.

603
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:05,510
Hurry.

604
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:10,929
How did you make all that
and still dress up so well?

605
00:50:12,172 --> 00:50:15,856
Gosh, can the two of you stop being
so cheesy over there and come eat?

606
00:50:17,842 --> 00:50:19,293
Let's go.

607
00:50:22,813 --> 00:50:26,082
Who is it? I'm going to kill myself
because I can't get a job.

608
00:50:26,083 --> 00:50:28,992
Who is Hyun Jae, that said there would
be a suicide party here?

609
00:50:29,992 --> 00:50:33,892
I received a strange invitation.

610
00:50:33,893 --> 00:50:37,384
Is it possible to meet my dead Hye Soo?

611
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:40,533
Gosh, they said it was the last
Christmas party.

612
00:50:40,534 --> 00:50:43,243
I thought there would be
young people here, but what is this?

613
00:50:43,244 --> 00:50:45,478
These are all people
that are going to die.

614
00:50:50,007 --> 00:50:53,986
I was in a coma for 20 years.

615
00:50:53,987 --> 00:50:55,918
And I woke up one month ago.

616
00:50:56,922 --> 00:50:59,235
I'm sure I was 18 years old...

617
00:50:59,981 --> 00:51:02,107
Take a look at these wrinkles
around my eyes.

618
00:51:02,108 --> 00:51:04,418
They're telling me that I'm 38 years old.

619
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:13,389
You said you gave up your dreams of art
because you need a job, right?

620
00:51:14,829 --> 00:51:18,858
And you said that the woman you were with
for eight years left you?

621
00:51:20,195 --> 00:51:23,312
So, you dated for eight years?

622
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:24,699
Oh my!

623
00:51:26,045 --> 00:51:27,418
Have you ever kissed?

624
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:34,906
I was on my way to confess my feelings
to a boy from my church.

625
00:51:34,907 --> 00:51:36,547
But I got in a car accident.

626
00:51:38,619 --> 00:51:41,333
I feel so sorry for you, Ma'am.

627
00:51:42,684 --> 00:51:46,732
Your daughter died three years ago.
How will you ever forget her?

628
00:51:46,733 --> 00:51:49,523
While I lay dead for 20 years...

629
00:51:50,849 --> 00:51:53,289
they say that my mother lived in the
hospital, as well.

630
00:51:55,083 --> 00:51:58,111
When you lose time...

631
00:51:58,112 --> 00:52:00,371
it means you lose everything.

632
00:52:07,293 --> 00:52:09,611
My name is Hyun Jae.

633
00:52:09,612 --> 00:52:11,710
In English, it means "the present".

634
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:13,712
Which can also mean "gift".

635
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:16,358
Hyun Jae, or this moment right now...

636
00:52:18,367 --> 00:52:19,594
It is a gift.

637
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:36,584
Your play was a huge success.
How do you feel now?

638
00:52:36,585 --> 00:52:39,136
Do you have plans for your next project?

639
00:52:39,137 --> 00:52:41,244
I'll do a detailed interview another time.

640
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:45,689
- Can you sign this for me?
- Please sign this!

641
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:49,410
Wow! Cha Hyun Suk really is successful,
isn't he?

642
00:52:49,411 --> 00:52:50,888
He sure is.

643
00:52:50,889 --> 00:52:52,629
Let's give this to him later.

644
00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:53,930
Let's go.

645
00:52:53,931 --> 00:52:55,959
- Picture, picture.
- One moment please.

646
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:57,963
I have to accept flowers
from my girlfriend first.

647
00:53:05,226 --> 00:53:07,804
What is this, Notting Hill?

648
00:53:08,262 --> 00:53:10,344
Let's go now.

649
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:17,152
Sang Ye, that was great.

650
00:53:18,083 --> 00:53:19,857
This is for me?

651
00:53:19,858 --> 00:53:22,547
Of course. You were my boss once.

652
00:53:22,548 --> 00:53:25,355
You worked so hard all that time.

653
00:53:25,356 --> 00:53:27,763
What do you mean?
She enjoyed it all.

654
00:53:27,764 --> 00:53:29,664
Now she's no longer
an Assistant Producer.

655
00:53:30,846 --> 00:53:34,567
She already has an idea for her project
after You & Now.

656
00:53:34,568 --> 00:53:37,004
What? That's not true.

657
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:38,146
Good job.

658
00:53:40,324 --> 00:53:42,609
What are you doing with my noona
standing right there?

659
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:44,139
To a girl with a boyfriend, at that.

660
00:53:46,438 --> 00:53:50,285
You better not do that
with other guys either.

661
00:53:50,286 --> 00:53:51,437
Soon Nam...

662
00:53:51,438 --> 00:53:54,349
Oh my! They must have something going on.

663
00:53:58,173 --> 00:54:01,299
I'm not sure if I can leave my store
in a part-time worker's hands.

664
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:04,455
Go on, President Ha.

665
00:54:04,456 --> 00:54:06,071
I'm here.

666
00:54:06,072 --> 00:54:07,393
Why are you here again?

667
00:54:07,394 --> 00:54:10,944
Gosh, we better have a time sheet
for Cha Hyun Suk in the store.

668
00:54:10,945 --> 00:54:13,874
I'm not busy now that the show is over.

669
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:16,605
Let's go see a movie,
since Dong Chul is here.

670
00:54:16,606 --> 00:54:18,959
No, I can't. I have somewhere to go.

671
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,000
Where are you going?

672
00:54:20,001 --> 00:54:22,750
Hey now. Don't try to know everything.

673
00:54:22,751 --> 00:54:24,561
I'm a mysterious woman.

674
00:54:25,827 --> 00:54:27,731
How long will you take? Where...

675
00:54:28,797 --> 00:54:31,150
I'll be watching your employee here!

676
00:54:34,893 --> 00:54:36,007
Watching you.

677
00:54:41,215 --> 00:54:43,013
You're too much. Too much!

678
00:54:43,014 --> 00:54:45,314
Go home and sleep, man.

679
00:54:45,315 --> 00:54:46,934
I'm watching a movie.

680
00:54:53,918 --> 00:54:56,127
Hyun Suk is still here?

681
00:54:56,128 --> 00:54:58,349
He's here all the time.

682
00:55:04,327 --> 00:55:05,473
No Ra!

683
00:55:05,474 --> 00:55:08,020
Oh, Lawyer Lee. You're here?

684
00:55:08,021 --> 00:55:09,471
Can I have a serving of spicy rice cakes?

685
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:10,993
Ha No Ra's spicy rice cakes.

686
00:55:10,994 --> 00:55:13,163
Okay. You're eating here, right?

687
00:55:16,284 --> 00:55:18,881
I came by earlier and you weren't here.

688
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:21,061
So I went back to the office.

689
00:55:26,202 --> 00:55:29,288
He's a lawyer at a law firm
across the street.

690
00:55:29,289 --> 00:55:32,099
He only comes to eat when No Ra's here.

691
00:55:34,619 --> 00:55:38,080
One other thing...
He's 35 years old.

692
00:55:38,081 --> 00:55:39,141
What?

693
00:55:47,014 --> 00:55:50,521
I'm busy. Why don't we talk inside?
Why did you tell me to come outside?

694
00:55:52,668 --> 00:55:54,799
I want to make a wish.

695
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,288
A wish?

696
00:55:56,289 --> 00:55:58,569
A wish for the time capsule.

697
00:55:58,570 --> 00:56:01,087
But I got it right.

698
00:56:01,088 --> 00:56:02,638
I got it right too.

699
00:56:02,639 --> 00:56:05,138
Let's continue being happy.

700
00:56:05,139 --> 00:56:06,897
You're next to me right now.

701
00:56:06,898 --> 00:56:08,547
Okay, okay.

702
00:56:08,548 --> 00:56:10,778
Tell me. What's your wish?

703
00:56:11,798 --> 00:56:14,648
Tell him that you won't sell
spicy rice cakes to him.

704
00:56:15,778 --> 00:56:17,969
Are you saying I shouldn't
run the business?

705
00:56:21,318 --> 00:56:22,599
I was kidding.

706
00:56:25,418 --> 00:56:28,178
But shouldn't you do something about it?

707
00:56:28,179 --> 00:56:30,317
You were all smiling at him.

708
00:56:30,318 --> 00:56:33,438
Of course I should smile at customers.
Should I scowl at them?

709
00:56:34,429 --> 00:56:37,429
Oh, I guess you're right.

710
00:56:38,429 --> 00:56:40,878
Then introduce me. As your boyfriend.

711
00:56:41,768 --> 00:56:43,878
- Why should I?
- What do you mean why?

712
00:56:44,528 --> 00:56:48,837
So that the punk Lawyer Lee
will stop showing interest in you.

713
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:52,968
Really? I thought he was interested
in our spicy rice cakes.

714
00:56:52,969 --> 00:56:54,948
He seemed like he was interested in me?

715
00:56:54,949 --> 00:56:57,309
Wow, that's crazy.

716
00:56:58,699 --> 00:57:00,698
You seem happy about it.

717
00:57:00,699 --> 00:57:03,547
If someone is interested in me,
isn't that a good thing?

718
00:57:03,548 --> 00:57:08,598
Hey, did you not see those fans at my
show that came at me like a swarm of bees?

719
00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:10,968
I'm totally popular.

720
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,509
But what did I do then?

721
00:57:13,278 --> 00:57:16,009
If you're going to be like this,
don't come here anymore.

722
00:57:18,838 --> 00:57:20,929
Hey, what are you guys doing?

723
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:22,627
Are you guys fighting?

724
00:57:22,628 --> 00:57:25,048
What's even worse is,
he didn't even leave after that.

725
00:57:25,829 --> 00:57:27,958
Cha Hyun Suk, No Ra seems upset.

726
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:31,539
Most men keep a closer watch
on their girlfriends than this.

727
00:57:42,458 --> 00:57:43,869
Have a seat, will you?

728
00:57:44,759 --> 00:57:46,442
You should go
after you finish eating this.

729
00:57:46,443 --> 00:57:48,127
We're supposed to meet tomorrow, remember?

730
00:57:48,128 --> 00:57:50,949
Let's eat first.
I'm hungry from laughing so much.

731
00:58:04,048 --> 00:58:05,435
Hey, Ha No Ra.

732
00:58:05,436 --> 00:58:09,368
We ordered the same thing,
but the ingredients don't look the same?

733
00:58:09,369 --> 00:58:12,438
Seriously, they are missing in mine too.
Only Cha Hyun Suk gets them?

734
00:58:13,318 --> 00:58:14,828
I won't stand for discrimination.

735
00:58:14,829 --> 00:58:16,009
Hey!

736
00:58:19,748 --> 00:58:21,898
Hurry up and eat and leave already.

737
00:58:29,568 --> 00:58:32,308
Ha No Ra, aren't you playing
way too hard to get?

738
00:58:32,309 --> 00:58:34,897
What if Hyun Suk gets away?

739
00:58:34,898 --> 00:58:37,948
If he gets away, then he gets away.

740
00:58:37,949 --> 00:58:39,477
Do you mean that?

741
00:58:39,478 --> 00:58:41,747
Being overly cautious and being
nice to someone

742
00:58:41,748 --> 00:58:44,304
doesn't make that person like me more.

743
00:58:44,338 --> 00:58:47,329
You can't force someone to like you.

744
00:58:47,889 --> 00:58:51,937
Hyun Suk is important to me,
but my life is also important.

745
00:58:51,938 --> 00:58:55,277
Goodness, so you secretly put a
deep fried seaweed roll in Hyun Suk's?

746
00:58:55,278 --> 00:58:57,328
Ha No Ra, you're more charming
than I thought.

747
00:58:57,329 --> 00:59:02,398
Hey, that's why I also said
he's important to me.

748
00:59:03,208 --> 00:59:06,368
Stop laughing. My goodness.
I'm so embarrassed. What do I do?

749
00:59:06,369 --> 00:59:08,668
<i>[Second Time First Love]</i>

750
00:59:16,009 --> 00:59:19,228
They are really good.

751
00:59:25,318 --> 00:59:26,788
Should we upload it now?

752
00:59:26,789 --> 00:59:29,638
I just drew them for fun.

753
00:59:29,639 --> 00:59:33,488
People look at this amateur forum
for fun too.

754
00:59:33,489 --> 00:59:35,517
- Should I press send?
- Wait, wait.

755
00:59:35,518 --> 00:59:37,878
What should I do?

756
00:59:38,818 --> 00:59:39,978
[It's been posted.]

757
00:59:40,929 --> 00:59:42,878
I won't tell anyone.

758
00:59:47,309 --> 00:59:48,998
Someone just commented.

759
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:51,018
Really?

760
00:59:52,289 --> 00:59:55,968
"I'm curious why Cha Dol
is being that way."

761
00:59:55,969 --> 00:59:58,128
"I look forward to the next one."

762
01:00:00,009 --> 01:00:01,018
Awesome.

763
01:00:03,579 --> 01:00:05,369
Wow, that's amazing.

764
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:15,588
Even on a Sunday,
the students look busy as ever.

765
01:00:17,438 --> 01:00:18,478
Oh.

766
01:00:18,639 --> 01:00:22,488
It's supposed to be four guys and girls.
Without you, it won't work.

767
01:00:22,489 --> 01:00:25,027
It's not that I don't want to. I can't.

768
01:00:25,028 --> 01:00:26,808
Didn't you guys break up?

769
01:00:26,809 --> 01:00:28,368
What happened?

770
01:00:28,369 --> 01:00:29,687
Let's go somewhere and talk.

771
01:00:29,688 --> 01:00:31,538
I can't. I have to go to the library.

772
01:00:31,539 --> 01:00:34,707
You know already.
I got 2.5 this semester because of an "F".

773
01:00:34,708 --> 01:00:36,588
I need to study. I'm going now.

774
01:00:40,708 --> 01:00:43,898
Does the kid's girlfriend know
that you're the kid's mom?

775
01:00:44,208 --> 01:00:46,008
Why would I tell her that?

776
01:00:46,009 --> 01:00:47,759
It'll make things uncomfortable.

777
01:00:48,438 --> 01:00:52,708
Then I shouldn't feel uncomfortable
doing this.

778
01:01:22,509 --> 01:01:25,739
If you don't want to answer,
you can leave.

779
01:01:27,398 --> 01:01:28,728
Right now!

780
01:01:33,199 --> 01:01:36,128
He must be truly crazy!

781
01:01:43,188 --> 01:01:45,227
Why don't you stop now, Professor?

782
01:01:45,228 --> 01:01:47,738
First, remove that hand.

783
01:01:47,739 --> 01:01:50,247
Those bodies belong to those girls.

784
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:52,059
<i>Wow, we have ourselves
a second Joan of Arc.</i>

785
01:01:52,478 --> 01:01:55,009
<i>Ma'am, are you going to look for a job
after you graduate?</i>

786
01:01:55,608 --> 01:01:57,119
Hey!

787
01:02:00,498 --> 01:02:04,758
<i>I've never once seen you dance
on a public stage before.</i>

788
01:02:04,759 --> 01:02:09,208
<i>You're doing something you want to do,
so who cares if you're 20 or 38?</i>

789
01:02:20,798 --> 01:02:24,548
<i>With lecture being canceled,
we get to do things like this. I like it!</i>

790
01:02:54,708 --> 01:02:56,027
What are you thinking about?

791
01:02:56,028 --> 01:02:59,448
Do you want to go to college again
now that you're here?

792
01:02:59,449 --> 01:03:00,817
No.

793
01:03:00,818 --> 01:03:04,337
It was good that I got to experience
going to college.

794
01:03:04,338 --> 01:03:07,748
There are so many unforgettable memories.

795
01:03:08,789 --> 01:03:10,709
Of all those memories,
the best one is me, right?

796
01:03:11,268 --> 01:03:12,837
In some ways.

797
01:03:12,838 --> 01:03:14,148
What do you mean?

798
01:03:14,648 --> 01:03:18,107
I did learn many things because I met you.

799
01:03:18,108 --> 01:03:19,818
Oh, is that right.

800
01:03:20,498 --> 01:03:23,158
Then should we stay here a little longer?

801
01:03:23,159 --> 01:03:24,567
So we can play together?

802
01:03:24,568 --> 01:03:26,288
It's okay.

803
01:03:26,289 --> 01:03:28,058
Didn't you say you have to go over
the script?

804
01:03:28,059 --> 01:03:30,349
Let's go. To our spot.

805
01:03:31,159 --> 01:03:32,208
Let's go.

806
01:04:13,858 --> 01:04:15,997
Do you want to go play over there?

807
01:04:15,998 --> 01:04:17,838
My friend here is sleeping right now.
