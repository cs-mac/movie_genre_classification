"After the thing was over,

00:01:00,915 --> 00:01:06,834

Plummie!

00:01:22,898 --> 00:01:24,818
Plummie, are you there?

21
00:01:27,898 --> 00:01:31,258
You are in there. Why didn't you
say you were in there?

22
00:01:32,578 --> 00:01:35,698
I wasn't entirely sure that I was.

00:01:36,858 --> 00:01:40,376
'Though the fall of France now seems
inevitable - thousands

What happens now?

Stilton Cheesewright is
baying for Bertie's blood

29
00:01:56,498 --> 00:02:00,256
and Jeeves will need an extra
portion of fish to come up

30
00:02:00,257 --> 00:02:03,016
with a scheme in order to extricate
the young man about town.

31
00:02:03,017 --> 00:02:05,498
I was talking,
Plummie, about the war.

32
00:02:05,499 --> 00:02:07,778
And I was talking about my novel.

33
00:02:10,738 --> 00:02:12,418
Who can that be?

34
00:02:16,698 --> 00:02:19,058
I think it's the German army.

35
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:23,058
Shall we let them in?

36
00:02:24,378 --> 00:02:26,578
Or shall we pretend to be out?

37
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,458
Hullo there!

38
00:02:35,298 --> 00:02:37,697
Er... What does he want?

39
00:02:37,698 --> 00:02:41,096
World domination, I imagine.
Don't antagonise him!

40
00:02:41,097 --> 00:02:42,936
I went through your books
the other day.

41
00:02:42,937 --> 00:02:44,616
You come out pretty anti-German.

42
00:02:44,617 --> 00:02:46,696
I think I did say it was time
Hitler took a firm

43
00:02:46,697 --> 00:02:49,498
position on his moustache.
I mean, does he want it or not?

44
00:02:50,498 --> 00:02:52,618
Ihre Papiere bitte!

45
00:02:54,178 --> 00:02:58,978
Very pretty uniform.
Sort of... Lincoln green!

46
00:03:00,858 --> 00:03:02,738
Do you speak no German at all?

47
00:03:03,858 --> 00:03:05,897
Es ist schones wetter!

48
00:03:05,898 --> 00:03:11,217
It is all you can say in German?
That it is nice weather?

49
00:03:11,218 --> 00:03:12,977
Es ist schones wetter!

50
00:03:12,978 --> 00:03:17,817
Well, you are English.
You only talk about the weather.

51
00:03:17,818 --> 00:03:20,297
I'm afraid I am. English, I mean.

52
00:03:20,298 --> 00:03:23,298
And I do adore
talking about the weather.

53
00:03:37,338 --> 00:03:39,298
We requisition your vehicles.

54
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:41,298
The keys to the cars, please.

55
00:03:45,018 --> 00:03:47,097
Also the bicycle.

56
00:03:47,098 --> 00:03:49,017
How low can men stoop?

57
00:03:49,018 --> 00:03:50,497
Was?

58
00:03:50,498 --> 00:03:52,578
Es ist schones wetter!

59
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:05,777
"I hove to at the stripling's side.

60
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:08,257
"Hullo, young Edwin," I said.

61
00:04:08,258 --> 00:04:11,056
"His gaze had been
riveted on the ground,

62
00:04:11,057 --> 00:04:13,778
"but at the sound of the
familiar voice..."

63
00:04:16,538 --> 00:04:21,256
"..A couple of pink-rimmed eyes came
swivelling round in my direction.

64
00:04:21,257 --> 00:04:24,498
"He looked up at me like a ferret
about to pass the time of day

65
00:04:24,499 --> 00:04:26,258
"with another ferret."

66
00:04:29,658 --> 00:04:32,137
"I'm studying ants," said the boy.

67
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:34,898
"Do you know
anything about ants, Bertie?"

68
00:04:41,138 --> 00:04:43,738
"Only from meeting them at picnics."

69
00:04:47,178 --> 00:04:50,778
What on earth is going on?
Germans. They're using the bathroom.

70
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:52,378
Swine.

71
00:04:54,858 --> 00:04:57,056
Hey!
I hope that's not my toothbrush.

72
00:04:57,057 --> 00:04:58,898
They're capable of anything.

73
00:05:01,738 --> 00:05:06,338
Apparently you have to report to
the German Kommandant in Le Touquet.

74
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,017
Oh.

75
00:05:08,018 --> 00:05:09,818
Just me?

76
00:05:17,778 --> 00:05:20,217
Ethel! Bunny, darling!

77
00:05:20,218 --> 00:05:22,177
Schnell! Pack!

78
00:05:22,178 --> 00:05:24,338
No time for a bath, I suppose.

79
00:05:26,058 --> 00:05:28,377
I don't know where my wife is.

80
00:05:28,378 --> 00:05:30,258
I'd like to say goodbye to her.

81
00:05:33,258 --> 00:05:35,018
Five minutes?

82
00:05:40,098 --> 00:05:42,137
20, perhaps?

83
00:05:42,138 --> 00:05:43,978
Ten it is!

84
00:05:45,218 --> 00:05:47,216
With negotiating skills like ours,

85
00:05:47,217 --> 00:05:49,538
war could possibly have
been averted.

86
00:05:57,138 --> 00:06:01,257
Wife. Ethel. Wife.

87
00:06:01,258 --> 00:06:03,817
Met her in New York in 1914.

88
00:06:03,818 --> 00:06:06,576
I seem to remember you
chaps were about to

89
00:06:06,577 --> 00:06:08,458
go on the rampage even then.

90
00:06:09,858 --> 00:06:13,058
She was on the stage.
Tremendous fun.

91
00:06:15,298 --> 00:06:17,217
Isn't she lovely?

92
00:06:17,218 --> 00:06:18,898
Schnell.

93
00:06:27,058 --> 00:06:31,177
Plummie? Is that you?
I rather fear it is, old thing.

94
00:06:31,178 --> 00:06:32,738
Schnell!

95
00:06:35,898 --> 00:06:39,377
The Kommandant told us
that we have to pack.

96
00:06:39,378 --> 00:06:43,378
We're being sent somewhere.
Not quite sure where.

97
00:06:45,498 --> 00:06:48,977
He had a glass eye.
Which was rather fetching.

98
00:06:48,978 --> 00:06:51,776
Plummie... I took the Collected Works
of Shakespeare.

99
00:06:51,777 --> 00:06:54,576
I thought about the Murglow Murder
Mystery, but then I thought,

100
00:06:54,577 --> 00:06:57,818
it's high time I read the stuffing
out of Henry the VI Part 2.

101
00:07:01,098 --> 00:07:04,257
I don't think
I have room for my novel.

102
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:06,298
Look after it for me, will you?

103
00:07:06,299 --> 00:07:09,537
We've had some good times,
me and that novel.

104
00:07:09,538 --> 00:07:11,058
Schnell!

105
00:07:16,818 --> 00:07:18,737
You'll need butter.

106
00:07:18,738 --> 00:07:21,776
There are practically no limits to
what a pack of butter can

107
00:07:21,777 --> 00:07:24,856
do in warm weather to
the inside of a small suitcase.

108
00:07:24,857 --> 00:07:27,778
I think I prefer my Shakespeare
unbuttered.

109
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:29,298
Oh, Plummie.

110
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:34,777
I shall be fine, sweetheart.

111
00:07:34,778 --> 00:07:38,378
It can't be as bad as getting an
honorary degree in Oxford.

112
00:07:41,098 --> 00:07:43,018
Please hold up, old thing.

113
00:07:45,738 --> 00:07:48,138
The Boche will think they've won.

114
00:07:49,538 --> 00:07:51,976
Mind you, they do have some
grounds for thinking

115
00:07:51,977 --> 00:07:53,498
that at the moment, don't they?

116
00:07:53,499 --> 00:07:54,858
Schnell!

117
00:07:56,778 --> 00:07:59,738
His German vocabulary is
almost as limited as mine.

118
00:08:03,618 --> 00:08:07,338
Toodle pip... old thing.

119
00:08:34,498 --> 00:08:38,697
I say. I say.

120
00:08:38,698 --> 00:08:41,897
Is this Algy of Algy's Bar?

121
00:08:41,898 --> 00:08:46,217
I am he. I cannot deny it.

122
00:08:46,218 --> 00:08:49,657
Is that by any chance a suitcase
you're carrying?

123
00:08:49,658 --> 00:08:52,937
Once again you have me
at a disadvantage.

124
00:08:52,938 --> 00:08:55,577
A suitcase is what it is, old bean.

125
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:59,577
As in - suitcase in which you pack
things for a journey?

126
00:08:59,578 --> 00:09:04,296
You are hitting the nail on the head
with almost suspicious regularity.

127
00:09:04,297 --> 00:09:08,098
As in - journey towards a dungeon to
which the Germans are planning

128
00:09:08,099 --> 00:09:10,737
to confine one for the duration?

129
00:09:10,738 --> 00:09:13,858
This too is horribly close to
the mark, old friend.

130
00:09:18,218 --> 00:09:22,977
I tremble like a badly-set
blancmange, Algy.

131
00:09:22,978 --> 00:09:24,578
Me too.

132
00:09:34,178 --> 00:09:36,978
What's happening in the world,
I wonder? Yes.

133
00:09:38,218 --> 00:09:41,498
Isn't it marvellous not to have
access to the English newspapers?

134
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:43,738
Like being on holiday!

135
00:09:45,338 --> 00:09:46,777
Are we in Germany?

136
00:09:46,778 --> 00:09:48,537
Not sure.

137
00:09:48,538 --> 00:09:51,577
At least we're no longer in Belgium.

138
00:09:51,578 --> 00:09:53,936
Home is not home to
a Belgian soldier

139
00:09:53,937 --> 00:09:57,938
until he can write his name in the
alluvial deposits on the floor.

140
00:09:59,778 --> 00:10:02,937
We're in Upper Silesia,
as a matter of fact.

141
00:10:02,938 --> 00:10:07,578
If this is Upper Silesia,
what must Lower Silesia be like?

142
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,858
Brilliant.

143
00:10:17,698 --> 00:10:19,937
Are you who I think you are?

144
00:10:19,938 --> 00:10:22,538
It all depends who you think
I am, I suppose.

145
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,578
PG Wodehouse.

146
00:10:26,538 --> 00:10:28,698
I'm afraid I am he.

147
00:10:32,578 --> 00:10:35,817
Name's Mackintosh.
Winchester and Oxford.

148
00:10:35,818 --> 00:10:38,617
In case anyone wants to know.

149
00:10:38,618 --> 00:10:41,338
Were you Oxford or Cambridge,
Mr Wodehouse?

150
00:10:42,858 --> 00:10:47,178
I wasn't actually at either. My
people couldn't afford to send me.

151
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:49,657
I went straight into the bank.

152
00:10:49,658 --> 00:10:51,458
Said the wrong thing, have I?

153
00:10:52,498 --> 00:10:56,137
Afraid you're stuck with me
for the duration.

154
00:10:56,138 --> 00:10:59,338
I was a war graves gardener.
In Boulogne.

155
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,658
"Leonora, my darling daughter.

156
00:11:07,738 --> 00:11:11,377
"If I knew where Plummie was,
I would write to him.

157
00:11:11,378 --> 00:11:13,097
"But I don't.

158
00:11:13,098 --> 00:11:16,936
"I am stuck here with only the dog
and the parrot for company.

159
00:11:16,937 --> 00:11:20,018
"I am teaching the parrot to say,
"God Save the King."

160

Apparently, it was a lunatic asylum.

They found the

Gentlemen!

My name is Buchelt.

00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:02,337
I am the camp leader,
as you say in English.

186
00:13:02,338 --> 00:13:06,177
Or Der Lagerfuhrer, as we say
in the German language.

187
00:13:06,178 --> 00:13:09,098
I have learned my English
in a good school.

188
00:13:09,099 --> 00:13:13,137
I was interned in England
during the last war,

189
00:13:13,138 --> 00:13:17,618
which by some mistake you English
seem to have won!

He reminds me strongly of my mother.

191
00:13:27,298 --> 00:13:29,456
It's Plum's stepdaughter here.
Leonora Cazalet.

192
00:13:29,457 --> 00:13:32,058
'Oh, Leonora.
I'm having trouble hearing.'

193
00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:36,017
There's a bombing raid on
at the moment. Very boring.

194
00:13:36,018 --> 00:13:39,056
We wanted to know
if there was any news of Plum.

195
00:13:39,057 --> 00:13:40,978
'Are you all right, Leonora?'

196
00:13:40,979 --> 00:13:47,097
No, no, no, we're fine.
Britain can take it, Mr Reynolds.

197
00:13:47,098 --> 00:13:51,217
'Though I think we'd all be
frightfully pleased

198
00:13:51,218 --> 00:13:53,977
'if you lot cared to lend us a hand!'

199
00:13:53,978 --> 00:13:55,578
Some of us wish we could.

200
00:13:57,018 --> 00:14:00,697
I'm glad you managed to
get your mother some money.

201
00:14:00,698 --> 00:14:04,098
We haven't heard a thing,
I'm afraid. But we have...

202
00:14:05,418 --> 00:14:07,057
My God!

203
00:14:07,058 --> 00:14:08,177
'What?'

204
00:14:08,178 --> 00:14:10,497
It's him! It's a postcard!

205
00:14:10,498 --> 00:14:12,417
Read it to me!

206
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:15,016
"Am in lunatic asylum
near Polish border.

207

"Am quite happy here

"Am hoping to be able to write it."

213
00:14:36,658 --> 00:14:39,737
Isn't he your perfect author,
Mr Reynolds?

214
00:14:39,738 --> 00:14:42,136
The Germans shove him
behind barbed wire

215
00:14:42,137 --> 00:14:45,256
and all he can think about is
the next Jeeves book.

216
00:14:45,257 --> 00:14:47,938
We have to try and get him
out of there.

217
00:14:51,818 --> 00:14:55,178
"The great advantage here is that
the authorities leave you alone

218
00:14:55,179 --> 00:15:00,017
"for most of the day,
so I have time to write.

219
00:15:00,018 --> 00:15:02,497
"It's all quite fun, actually.

220
00:15:02,498 --> 00:15:06,298
"If you see a German officer,
you are supposed to shout, "Achtung"

221
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:08,218
"and stand to attention.

222
00:15:10,858 --> 00:15:13,176
"Plenty of scope for practical jokes

"on the lines of the old
game of Beaver!

224
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:21,738
"I do miss you, Bunny darling."

225
00:15:24,618 --> 00:15:27,377
What are you writing now, Wodehouse?

226
00:15:27,378 --> 00:15:29,697
A letter to my wife.

227
00:15:29,698 --> 00:15:31,418
Where is she?

228
00:15:33,218 --> 00:15:35,498
My stepdaughter got her some money.

229
00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:38,418
She seems to be still
stuck in France.

230
00:15:39,658 --> 00:15:43,258
I never married.
Never found the right woman.

231
00:15:46,978 --> 00:15:51,297
I admire you, Wodehouse.
You manage to keep so calm.

232
00:15:51,298 --> 00:15:53,297
How do you do it?

233
00:15:53,298 --> 00:16:00,217
I write. Anything.
Novels, letters, anything.

234
00:16:00,218 --> 00:16:05,657
Actually, I am writing a sort
of diary of the life of an internee.

235
00:16:05,658 --> 00:16:09,298
I bet it's a laugh.
Can we hear a bit?

236
00:16:10,538 --> 00:16:12,498
It's awfully rough at the moment.

237
00:16:12,499 --> 00:16:13,818
Oh.

238
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:17,378
But...

239
00:16:23,378 --> 00:16:25,377
Well, er...

240
00:16:25,378 --> 00:16:29,858
Well, this is one of our many stops
on the way to this holiday camp.

241
00:16:29,859 --> 00:16:33,178
Loos prison.
For those who remember it.

242
00:16:35,378 --> 00:16:39,938
"Owing to having led a blameless
life since infancy, I had never seen

243
00:16:39,939 --> 00:16:42,217
"the inside of a calaboose before

244
00:16:42,218 --> 00:16:45,057
"and directly I set eyes
on the official

245
00:16:45,058 --> 00:16:50,697
"in the front office of Loos Prison,
I regretted that I was doing so now.

246
00:16:50,698 --> 00:16:53,898
"There are moments, as we pass
through life, when we gaze

247
00:16:53,899 --> 00:16:58,617
"into a stranger's face and say to
ourselves, "I have met a friend."

248
00:16:58,618 --> 00:17:01,778
"This was not one of
those occasions.

249
00:17:03,338 --> 00:17:07,337
"There is probably nobody
in the world less elfin than

250
00:17:07,338 --> 00:17:11,176
"a French prison official. And the
one twirling his moustache at me

251
00:17:11,177 --> 00:17:14,536
"looked like something
out of a film about Devil's Island.

252
00:17:14,537 --> 00:17:17,496
"When I got out into the exercise
yard next morning

253
00:17:17,497 --> 00:17:21,336
"and met some of the men who had
been in the place for a week,

254
00:17:21,337 --> 00:17:25,738
"I found that they, on arrival,
had been stood with their faces to

255
00:17:25,739 --> 00:17:31,257
"the wall, stripped to their BVDs,
deprived of all their belongings

256
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:35,298
"and generally made to feel like so
many imprisoned pieces of cheese."

257
00:17:37,658 --> 00:17:39,697
More!

258
00:17:39,698 --> 00:17:41,938
Yes, come on, Plum.

259
00:17:43,538 --> 00:17:47,977
Why is cheese a funny word?
It is though, isn't it?

260
00:17:47,978 --> 00:17:49,178
Cheese!

261
00:17:50,538 --> 00:17:52,618
Always good for a chuckle is cheese.

262
00:17:57,418 --> 00:18:00,977
I'm er... I'm 60 next month.

263
00:18:00,978 --> 00:18:03,098
They're going to let me out.

264
00:18:04,498 --> 00:18:09,057
If you need any money, my agent
is sending me food parcels

265
00:18:09,058 --> 00:18:13,656
and trying to get my royalties from
German translations of my books.

266
00:18:13,657 --> 00:18:15,898
You're too good for
this world, Plum.

267
00:18:15,899 --> 00:18:17,538
Achtung, chaps.

268
00:18:20,418 --> 00:18:26,697
Prisoner 796! Whitehousen!
To see the Lagerfuhrer!

269
00:18:26,698 --> 00:18:31,058
Oh, Lord! What have I done now?

270
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,178
At ease!

271
00:18:39,898 --> 00:18:42,417
Your English is frightfully good.

272
00:18:42,418 --> 00:18:45,696
We have received many letters
about you, Herr Wodehouse.

273
00:18:45,697 --> 00:18:48,818
It seems we have a famous author
in our camp.

274
00:18:48,819 --> 00:18:51,457
Well... author, anyway.

275
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,377

276

and your American agent lead
a campaign for your release.

277
00:18:58,658 --> 00:19:02,338
I don't want to be treated any
differently to anyone else.

278
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:08,577
The old school tie. The monocle.
The spats. Ja?

279
00:19:08,578 --> 00:19:10,977
If you say so.

280
00:19:10,978 --> 00:19:15,657

It is a very funny book.

281
00:19:15,658 --> 00:19:18,258
I don't think
I wrote a book called...

282
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:20,577
Oh. Right Ho, Jeeves!

283
00:19:20,578 --> 00:19:22,458
What is this "Right Ho?"

284
00:19:23,778 --> 00:19:27,017
I have read your work,
Herr Wodehouse.

He loves his pig.
It is most amusing.

00:21:15,459 --> 00:21:19,378
I am the only beast, I think!

315
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,456
That's wonderful, Mr Wodehouse.

316
00:21:25,457 --> 00:21:27,896
Don't look too wonderful,
old bean, will you?

317
00:21:27,897 --> 00:21:32,138
You're supposed to look beaten
and abject and cruelly mistreated.

318
00:21:32,139 --> 00:21:35,977
Mr Mackintosh has a dark,
witty side to him.

319
00:21:35,978 --> 00:21:39,418
Maybe we should have a picture
of you and Mr Mackintosh together.

320
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:41,978
Oh, no, no, no! No.

321
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:52,857
Are they really treating you OK?

322
00:21:52,858 --> 00:21:55,217
I'm afraid they are, on the whole.

323
00:21:55,218 --> 00:21:57,537
Plum's writing a book about it.

324
00:21:57,538 --> 00:21:59,538
He made us all laugh with it.

325
00:22:00,818 --> 00:22:05,217
Are you chaps going to
come into the war?

326
00:22:05,218 --> 00:22:07,818
Nobody quite knows at the moment.

327
00:22:10,418 --> 00:22:12,537
Plack.

328
00:22:12,538 --> 00:22:15,218
Didn't you know
Wodehouse in Hollywood?

329
00:22:15,219 --> 00:22:16,538
I did.

330
00:22:18,018 --> 00:22:21,576
Some American journalist
named Thuermer managed to find out

331
00:22:21,577 --> 00:22:24,336
he's interned in a civilian camp
in Tost.

332
00:22:24,337 --> 00:22:27,696
He's done an interview and the
New York Times are running it.

333
00:22:27,697 --> 00:22:29,418
What does he say about us?

334
00:22:29,419 --> 00:22:33,057
He says we feed him.
He is quite nice.

335
00:22:33,058 --> 00:22:36,338
Wodehouse is incapable of being
nasty about anyone.

336
00:22:40,658 --> 00:22:42,457
He must be 60 by now.

337
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:44,976
Do we still keep aliens
in prison after 60?

338
00:22:44,977 --> 00:22:46,618
We release them sometimes.

339
00:22:48,098 --> 00:22:51,056
In this case, I suspect with
a great deal of publicity.

340
00:22:51,057 --> 00:22:53,896
To show the Americans what
nice people we are.

341
00:22:53,897 --> 00:22:57,258
We don't want them in the war, do we?
There are an awful lot of them.

342
00:22:58,738 --> 00:23:01,016
All he says
is that we are feeding him.

343
00:23:01,017 --> 00:23:04,178
If you are thinking you can get him
to do a commercial for Germany,

344
00:23:04,179 --> 00:23:05,857
forget it.

345
00:23:05,858 --> 00:23:08,138
He is the typical, loyal Englishman.

346
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:13,616
"The first time you see
a German soldier in your garden,

347
00:23:13,617 --> 00:23:18,218
"your impulse is to jump ten feet
straight into the air and you do so.

348
00:23:18,219 --> 00:23:21,537
"But this feeling of
embarrassment soon passes.

349
00:23:21,538 --> 00:23:23,978
"A week later you find you are
only jumping five feet."

350
00:23:25,498 --> 00:23:28,818
"The chief drawback of being
an internee is that

351
00:23:28,819 --> 00:23:31,537
"you are away from home
a good deal."

352
00:23:31,538 --> 00:23:33,856
"It is not pleasant to think
that by the time

353
00:23:33,857 --> 00:23:37,576
"I see my Pekinese again, she will
have completely forgotten me

354
00:23:37,577 --> 00:23:42,416
"and will bite me to the bone - her
invariable practice with strangers.

355
00:23:42,417 --> 00:23:45,416
"And I feel that, when I rejoin
my wife, I had better take

356
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:48,338
"a letter of introduction,
just to be on the safe side."

357
00:23:53,418 --> 00:23:57,497
Why is this funny? That he
will not recognise his wife?

358
00:23:57,498 --> 00:23:59,657
Does he not like his wife?

359
00:23:59,658 --> 00:24:05,058
It is English humour. It is
why Wodehouse is a famous genius.

360
00:24:06,818 --> 00:24:09,258
I do not understand it.

361
00:24:15,858 --> 00:24:18,456
Apparently, he is writing
some humorous pieces

362
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,338
about life in this camp of his.

363
00:24:22,018 --> 00:24:24,498
Maybe that can be good
for us, Werner.

364
00:24:24,499 --> 00:24:26,137
How?

365
00:24:26,138 --> 00:24:29,577
Get on to the Lagerfuhrer
at Tost and tell him

366
00:24:29,578 --> 00:24:33,498
I have a proposition I wish him
to put to the great Wodehouse.

367
00:24:33,499 --> 00:24:37,538
But Wodehouse is not to know
it comes from us.

368
00:24:43,578 --> 00:24:46,577
This is funny! Very, very funny!

369
00:24:46,578 --> 00:24:48,497
The chaps seem to enjoy it.

370
00:24:48,498 --> 00:24:50,817
I really did enjoy it.

371
00:24:50,818 --> 00:24:55,298
It reminded me of my time as a guest
of His Majesty's government!

372
00:24:57,298 --> 00:25:02,017
This passage - when you are being
driven away from Loos prison.

373
00:25:02,018 --> 00:25:05,857
"Summing up my experience
as a gaol bird,

374
00:25:05,858 --> 00:25:09,537
"I would say that a prison is all
right for a visit,

375
00:25:09,538 --> 00:25:13,417
"but I wouldn't live there
if you GAVE me the place.

376
00:25:13,418 --> 00:25:18,377
"On my part, at any rate,
there was no moaning at the bar

377
00:25:18,378 --> 00:25:22,538
"when we left Loos and..."
You read this bit. Please.

378
00:25:23,978 --> 00:25:26,417
"I was glad to go.

379
00:25:26,418 --> 00:25:29,858
"The last I saw of the old Alma
Mater was the warder

380
00:25:29,859 --> 00:25:33,257
"closing the door of the van
and standing back

381
00:25:33,258 --> 00:25:36,897
"with the French equivalent of,
"Right away!"

382
00:25:36,898 --> 00:25:40,458
"He said, "Au revoir" to me,
which I thought a little tactless."

383
00:25:42,218 --> 00:25:47,697
Just because we are at war,
it does not mean we cannot laugh.

384
00:25:47,698 --> 00:25:49,898
My view entirely.

385
00:25:59,778 --> 00:26:01,856
You like this room for writing?

386
00:26:01,857 --> 00:26:04,218
It's very kind of you to
give it to me.

387
00:26:11,458 --> 00:26:16,737
It's... er... it's a padded cell.
Rather appropriate, really.

388
00:26:16,738 --> 00:26:21,177
What you write. About the camp.
It is very funny.

389
00:26:21,178 --> 00:26:26,537
Very, very funny.
Like Bertie Wooster and Jeeves. No?

390
00:26:26,538 --> 00:26:28,417
Well...

391
00:26:28,418 --> 00:26:30,618
You should broadcast these writings.

392
00:26:32,778 --> 00:26:37,977
Well... I'm rather... tied up here
at the moment.

393
00:26:37,978 --> 00:26:39,377
Indeed.

394
00:26:39,378 --> 00:26:42,298
But soon I think you will be free.

395
00:26:45,618 --> 00:26:47,377
Will I?

396
00:26:47,378 --> 00:26:50,137
You are almost 60, Herr Wodehouse.

397
00:26:50,138 --> 00:26:54,417
The German government has no quarrel
with old age pensioners.

398
00:26:54,418 --> 00:26:56,137
Well...

399
00:26:56,138 --> 00:26:59,618
They seem to have quarrelled with
almost everyone else.

400
00:27:02,018 --> 00:27:04,258
Most amusing.

401
00:27:08,138 --> 00:27:12,617
So you might... contemplate
broadcasting to America.

402
00:27:12,618 --> 00:27:14,337
If you were let out.

403
00:27:14,338 --> 00:27:16,818
I gave an interview to
the Americans, didn't I?

404
00:27:16,819 --> 00:27:19,337
That seemed to be all right.

405
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:21,858
I do worry about the Americans.

406
00:27:23,458 --> 00:27:26,817
And they seem to be rather
worried about me.

407
00:27:26,818 --> 00:27:33,457
There is a war on.
And war is not a pleasant business.

408
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:38,497
Indeed not. I think, on the whole,

409
00:27:38,498 --> 00:27:39,938
I'm against it.

410
00:27:44,658 --> 00:27:46,618
I also.

411
00:28:00,738 --> 00:28:03,177
So he has taken the bait.

412
00:28:03,178 --> 00:28:05,416
We keep the Gestapo out of it. Yes?

413
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:06,858
They are not interested.

414
00:28:07,938 --> 00:28:11,337
I wouldn't want him
to be too compromised.

415
00:28:11,338 --> 00:28:14,737
I'm fond of the old boy.
He's like a child.

416
00:28:14,738 --> 00:28:17,898
My dear Plack, the whole point
of the exercise is that this man

417
00:28:17,899 --> 00:28:22,217
is a loyal Englishman saying that
not all Germans are swine.

418
00:28:22,218 --> 00:28:24,536
I am assuming that is what
he will say.

419
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:26,816
He will not talk
about unpleasant things.

420
00:28:26,817 --> 00:28:29,616
He does not like to
talk about unpleasant things.

421
00:28:29,617 --> 00:28:32,216
So he will not make his time
with us seem too unpleasant.

422
00:28:32,217 --> 00:28:34,856
Which will make us popular
with the Americans.

423
00:28:34,857 --> 00:28:37,138
Look at all this!
He is a hero to them!

424
00:28:37,139 --> 00:28:40,098
They like to accentuate the positive.

425
00:28:48,098 --> 00:28:50,457
Beware the leg break, Grant.

426
00:28:50,458 --> 00:28:52,216
I think as he made the ball, Plum,

427
00:28:52,217 --> 00:28:54,618
he may have a clue as to
how it behaves.

428
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:59,457
We old codgers have it easy,
don't we?

429
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:03,656
There's some... there's some other
camp further down the road.

430
00:29:03,657 --> 00:29:05,656
I hear ghastly things about it.

431
00:29:05,657 --> 00:29:08,018
Don't want to
think about things like that.

432
00:29:08,019 --> 00:29:11,657
Nobody does, Plum. Bowl up, eh?

433
00:29:11,658 --> 00:29:15,176
Is Mackintosh fielding
or is he doing botanical research?

434
00:29:15,177 --> 00:29:18,016
I don't know WHAT he is or WHO
he is. But I don't like him.

435
00:29:18,017 --> 00:29:20,296
I have no objection to grammar
school boys

436
00:29:20,297 --> 00:29:22,698
unless they pretend to be
something else.

437
00:29:23,898 --> 00:29:25,658
Wadhosen?

438
00:29:29,378 --> 00:29:32,737
Widhoose. Werdhowz. Weidhiss.

439
00:29:32,738 --> 00:29:36,857
Whatever you choose to call me,
I am here.

440
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,818
You are to be released.

441
00:29:42,618 --> 00:29:44,738
Is this to do with being 60?

442
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:49,938
I'm only 59-and-three-quarters.

443
00:29:54,618 --> 00:29:58,178
What are you going to put down?
Bowler seized in mid over?

444
00:30:00,458 --> 00:30:04,617
I shall miss you chaps.
We'll miss you too, old boy.

445
00:30:04,618 --> 00:30:06,258
Who's going to make us laugh?

446
00:30:06,259 --> 00:30:08,777
Who's going to give us good advice?

447
00:30:08,778 --> 00:30:12,617
Who's going to get such bloody
wonderful food parcels?

448
00:30:12,618 --> 00:30:15,377
And share them out, what's more?

449
00:30:15,378 --> 00:30:17,818
You must pack. Now.

450
00:30:33,858 --> 00:30:37,458
Also Mackintosh.
You also are released.

451
00:30:41,658 --> 00:30:45,057
Didn't I tell you boys?
I was 60 last week.

452
00:30:45,058 --> 00:30:48,177
What's going on here, Mackintosh?

453
00:30:48,178 --> 00:30:50,977
Don't worry, "chaps".

454
00:30:50,978 --> 00:30:54,376
I'll look after the greatest English
comic writer since Shakespeare.

455
00:30:54,377 --> 00:30:57,296
Look, I don't know what your
involvement is in all of this,

456
00:30:57,297 --> 00:31:00,936
Mackintosh, but if you do anything
to harm Plummie Wodehouse,

457
00:31:00,937 --> 00:31:04,338
when this war is over and we
are back home, I will find you

458
00:31:04,339 --> 00:31:07,337
and push your teeth
down your throat.

459
00:31:07,338 --> 00:31:10,738
Who knows what will happen
when the war is over, old bean.

460
00:31:10,739 --> 00:31:14,977
Maybe jolly old England won't be
there any more, "old chap".

461
00:31:14,978 --> 00:31:17,138
Pip-pip, you fellows!

462
00:32:36,378 --> 00:32:40,257
My God! I can't believe this!

463
00:32:40,258 --> 00:32:43,857
Plum Wodehouse,
as I live and breathe.

464
00:32:43,858 --> 00:32:46,017
What can I do for you boys?

465
00:32:46,018 --> 00:32:52,177
How extraordinary meeting you here,
Werner. I haven't seen you since...

466
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:53,857
Since Hollywood.

467
00:32:53,858 --> 00:32:58,216
Where they paid you millions for
sitting around and doing nothing.

468
00:32:58,217 --> 00:33:00,976
What an extraordinary coincidence!
The name's Mackintosh.

469
00:33:00,977 --> 00:33:03,536
I've been released at the same time
as Mr Wodehouse!

470
00:33:03,537 --> 00:33:06,536
Nice for Plum to have another
British fellow along. Indeed.

471
00:33:06,537 --> 00:33:09,458
Everyone in America has been
campaigning for Plum's release.

472
00:33:09,459 --> 00:33:11,097
Good to hear it.

473
00:33:11,098 --> 00:33:14,658
I'd love to know if there's any
chance of seeing Ethel again.

474
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:19,017
Ethel! My God!
My favourite Englishwoman!

475
00:33:19,018 --> 00:33:20,898
Mine too.

476
00:33:22,298 --> 00:33:26,617
I'm sure we can organise it.
I can organise most things.

477
00:33:26,618 --> 00:33:28,897
It's been a big press effort.

478
00:33:28,898 --> 00:33:32,818
That New York Times piece has made
you even more famous than you were.

479
00:33:33,858 --> 00:33:37,018
We must think of a way of
putting you in touch

480
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:39,777
with the great American public.

481
00:33:39,778 --> 00:33:42,698
Perhaps you could broadcast.
Over the radio.

482
00:33:44,178 --> 00:33:46,017
Well, why not?

483
00:33:46,018 --> 00:33:49,418
I understand quite a few
British POW's have gone on air

484
00:33:49,419 --> 00:33:52,177
to tell their people
they're all right.

485
00:33:52,178 --> 00:33:55,298
And you'll try and find Ethel,
Werner, will you?

486
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:58,058
Naturally. Naturally.

487
00:33:59,978 --> 00:34:03,778
I suppose it would let my American
readers know I'm OK.

488
00:34:06,138 --> 00:34:09,057
I suppose.

489
00:34:09,058 --> 00:34:12,338
We have had a communication from
someone who is called Werner Plack.

490
00:34:12,339 --> 00:34:14,657
From the Foreign Ministry.

491
00:34:14,658 --> 00:34:16,697
I think I know that name.

492
00:34:16,698 --> 00:34:19,056
We used to know
a Werner Plack in Hollywood.

493
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,058
He was an absolute sweetheart.

494
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,137
He was your sweetheart?

495
00:34:23,138 --> 00:34:27,377
If only, darling.
He is an absolute dish.

496
00:34:27,378 --> 00:34:29,738
Could you get him for me?

497
00:34:31,018 --> 00:34:34,418
You mean,
you mean on the telephone?

498
00:34:36,018 --> 00:34:40,898
For you, Mrs Wodehouse, anything.
You are our favourite enemy alien.

499
00:34:43,658 --> 00:34:46,258
It seems your husband
may be released soon.

500
00:34:51,578 --> 00:34:57,057
Well, you are obviously very
famous in Germany, Wodehouse.

501
00:34:57,058 --> 00:34:59,297
Yes, isn't it strange?

502
00:34:59,298 --> 00:35:03,617
One would have thought they had
no sense of humour at all.

503
00:35:03,618 --> 00:35:06,057
Is zis a sausage, mein freund?

504
00:35:06,058 --> 00:35:08,177
Exactly.

505
00:35:08,178 --> 00:35:12,377
You really should ask if you
can get on the radio as well.

506
00:35:12,378 --> 00:35:15,457
Oh, as I say, I'm not a writer.

507
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:18,137
Though I have written things.

508
00:35:18,138 --> 00:35:20,057
I'm not really a writer.

509
00:35:20,058 --> 00:35:24,737
In the sense of going
right down deep into life.

510
00:35:24,738 --> 00:35:27,857
I'm just a musical comedy man,
really.

511
00:35:27,858 --> 00:35:30,777
Although comedy is important,
isn't it?

512
00:35:30,778 --> 00:35:35,497
It reminds us all
of our common humanity.

513
00:35:35,498 --> 00:35:37,337
Er...

514
00:35:37,338 --> 00:35:39,177
Gosh!

515
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:41,017
Am I being pretentious?

516
00:35:41,018 --> 00:35:42,777
Absolutely not!

517
00:35:42,778 --> 00:35:46,257
I just think writing is
so important.

518
00:35:46,258 --> 00:35:48,977
People telling
the truth about things.

519
00:35:48,978 --> 00:35:51,936
Encouraging others to think
life is worthwhile.

520
00:35:51,937 --> 00:35:54,498
Or a waste of time,
in the case of certain authors.

521
00:36:12,778 --> 00:36:17,298
So you're going to broadcast
your talks... on the radio?

522
00:36:18,938 --> 00:36:20,976
Do you think that would a good idea?

523
00:36:20,977 --> 00:36:24,538
We have to tell them
we're not down and out, don't we?

524
00:36:24,539 --> 00:36:28,817
The old school still has some fight
left in her.

525
00:36:28,818 --> 00:36:30,937
I'm all for that.

526
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:33,217
Stiff upper you-know-what.

527
00:36:33,218 --> 00:36:36,338
I think, you know,
tell the truth.

528
00:36:37,698 --> 00:36:42,138
Great is the truth
and it shall prevail.

529
00:36:43,418 --> 00:36:45,257
I think I believe that.

530
00:36:45,258 --> 00:36:46,898
Good for you.

531
00:36:55,658 --> 00:37:00,297
Writing is escape for me.
In the literal sense.

532
00:37:00,298 --> 00:37:01,938
Of escape from prison.

533
00:37:10,098 --> 00:37:11,938
Good night, Mackintosh.

534
00:37:24,138 --> 00:37:28,297
At least we have got you
a presentable jacket!

535
00:37:28,298 --> 00:37:30,817
What's Mackintosh doing here?

536
00:37:30,818 --> 00:37:33,736
I think we thought it would be nice
for you to have

537
00:37:33,737 --> 00:37:35,538
a fellow Englishman around.

538
00:37:37,178 --> 00:37:38,578
Ah.

539
00:37:39,898 --> 00:37:41,898
Good for morale, sort of thing?

540
00:37:41,899 --> 00:37:43,098
Indeed.

541
00:37:46,178 --> 00:37:50,058
You should put him on as well.
Don't let me hog the limelight.

542
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:53,818
He may have family
he wants to reassure.

543
00:37:58,938 --> 00:38:01,658
This is
the German Short Wave Station.

544
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:08,017
Here in our studio in Berlin
tonight is Mr PG Wodehouse,

545
00:38:08,018 --> 00:38:11,377
the well known father of the
inimitable Jeeves,

546
00:38:11,378 --> 00:38:13,697
of Bertie Wooster,

547
00:38:13,698 --> 00:38:19,537
Lord Emsworth, Mr Mulliner and
other delightful persons.

548
00:38:19,538 --> 00:38:23,577
Mr Wodehouse has been in Germany
for almost a year

549
00:38:23,578 --> 00:38:27,496
since German troops occupied
his residence in Northern France.

550
00:38:27,497 --> 00:38:31,498
We felt his American readers might
be interested to hear from him

551
00:38:31,499 --> 00:38:33,617
and so we have invited him

552
00:38:33,618 --> 00:38:39,818
to the microphone to tell you in his
own words how it all happened.

553
00:38:49,058 --> 00:38:54,497
It is just possible that my
listeners may detect in this

554
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:58,297
little talk of mine,
a slight goofiness,

555
00:38:58,298 --> 00:39:01,938
a certain disposition to ramble
in my remarks.

556
00:39:03,018 --> 00:39:07,297
If so, the matter,
as Bertie Wooster would say,

557
00:39:07,298 --> 00:39:10,338
is susceptible of a ready
explanation.

558
00:39:12,338 --> 00:39:17,137
I have just emerged into the outer
world after 49 weeks

559
00:39:17,138 --> 00:39:21,057
of Civil Internment
in a German internment camp

560
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:24,497
and the effects have not
entirely worn off.

561
00:39:24,498 --> 00:39:29,777
I feel slightly screwy
and inclined to pause at intervals

562
00:39:29,778 --> 00:39:34,497
in order to cut out paper dolls
and stick straws in my hair,

563
00:39:34,498 --> 00:39:37,178
or such of my hair as I still have.

564
00:39:38,778 --> 00:39:44,937
But it has been in many ways
quite an agreeable experience.

565
00:39:44,938 --> 00:39:48,417
There is a good deal to be
said for internment.

566
00:39:48,418 --> 00:39:50,176
It keeps you out of the saloons

567
00:39:50,177 --> 00:39:52,696
and gives you time to catch up
on your reading.

568
00:39:52,697 --> 00:39:54,338
You also get a lot of sleep.

569
00:39:56,498 --> 00:39:58,696
This is the transcript
of the Wodehouse broadcast.

570
00:39:58,697 --> 00:40:01,698
Caversham picked it up on shortwave.
It seems fairly harmless stuff.

571
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:03,057
You think so?

572
00:40:03,058 --> 00:40:05,416
"All that happened,
as far as I was concerned, was that

573
00:40:05,417 --> 00:40:08,376
"I was strolling on the lawn with my
wife one morning, when she lowered

574
00:40:08,377 --> 00:40:11,336
"her voice and said, "Don't look now,
but here comes the German army!"

575
00:40:11,337 --> 00:40:13,976
"And there they were,
a fine body of men rather prettily

576
00:40:13,977 --> 00:40:16,018
"dressed in green,
carrying machine guns."

577
00:40:16,019 --> 00:40:18,857
I thought it was rather amusing.

578
00:40:18,858 --> 00:40:20,377
Did you indeed?

579
00:40:20,378 --> 00:40:23,257
It was only on short wave
to America.

580
00:40:23,258 --> 00:40:26,258
Only to America? Only to America?

581
00:40:27,698 --> 00:40:30,896
Have you any idea what is
going on in the world?

582
00:40:30,897 --> 00:40:33,736
That is the whole point
of the bloody German exercise.

583
00:40:33,737 --> 00:40:37,056
To try and reassure the Americans
and keep them neutral.

584
00:40:37,057 --> 00:40:39,976
I have spent a six-month tour
of the USA trying to get

585
00:40:39,977 --> 00:40:43,338
the Yanks INTO the war because we
all know that if we do not do so,

586
00:40:43,339 --> 00:40:46,097
we may well LOSE this bloody war.

587
00:40:46,098 --> 00:40:48,296
We are losing shipping
in the North Atlantic.

588
00:40:48,297 --> 00:40:50,058
We are weeks away from losing!

589
00:40:50,059 --> 00:40:53,657
We have to get the Americans
in on our side!

590
00:40:53,658 --> 00:40:55,896
Do I have to spell it out to you?

591
00:40:55,897 --> 00:40:58,858
What do you imagine Winston has been
doing for the last six months?

592
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:02,817
The Americans are crucial.
And this IDIOT is not helping.

593
00:41:02,818 --> 00:41:06,298
We are fighting for our lives here.
And he makes JOKES!

594
00:41:11,978 --> 00:41:13,337
Ah, Mr Wodehouse.

595
00:41:13,338 --> 00:41:16,096
I hear you have been broadcasting to
America over the Nazi radio.

596
00:41:16,097 --> 00:41:18,416
Have you made your peace
with Germany, Mr Wodehouse?

597
00:41:18,417 --> 00:41:20,656
We read in the New York papers
that they treated you

598
00:41:20,657 --> 00:41:22,696
well in the internment camp,
is that true?

599
00:41:22,697 --> 00:41:25,016
Didn't you feel like fighting back
against the people

600
00:41:25,017 --> 00:41:26,618
who were imprisoning you?

601
00:41:26,619 --> 00:41:28,417
Er...

602
00:41:28,418 --> 00:41:32,257
I found it difficult to be
belligerent in camp.

603
00:41:32,258 --> 00:41:34,898
You find it difficult to be
belligerent about the war, right?

604
00:41:34,899 --> 00:41:36,577
I didn't say that.

605
00:41:36,578 --> 00:41:39,698
I said I found it difficult
to be belligerent in camp.

606
00:41:39,699 --> 00:41:41,977
I was with prisoners who...

607
00:41:41,978 --> 00:41:44,656
He finds it difficult to feel
belligerent about this war.

608
00:41:44,657 --> 00:41:46,896
When journalists put
words in your mouth,

609
00:41:46,897 --> 00:41:49,938
I do wish they would give you
better dialogue.

610
00:41:49,939 --> 00:41:54,017
I must ask you to leave.
Please. Please. Thank you.

611
00:41:54,018 --> 00:41:57,058
'And now here is William Connor,
Cassandra of the Daily Mirror,

612
00:41:57,059 --> 00:41:59,177

00:42:29,218 --> 00:42:31,057
'When the war broke out,

622
00:42:31,058 --> 00:42:34,378
'Pelham Grenville Wodehouse
was at Le Touquet - gambling.'

623
00:42:34,379 --> 00:42:38,697
Plummie hardly ever gambled.
And then only for small stakes.

624
00:42:38,698 --> 00:42:41,058
This makes him sound like a playboy.

625
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:45,297
'Denmark had been overrun
and Norway had been occupied.

626
00:42:45,298 --> 00:42:47,616
'But Wodehouse still
went on with his fun.'

627
00:42:47,617 --> 00:42:49,456
He tried his damndest to get out.

628
00:42:49,457 --> 00:42:52,096
There was even talk of getting
a boat to him, do you remember?

629
00:42:52,097 --> 00:42:55,376
This is lies. I thought the British
didn't do propaganda lies!

630
00:42:55,377 --> 00:42:58,096
I thought that was the whole point
of our democracy?

631
00:42:58,097 --> 00:42:59,856
All we need to do is
get in touch with him.

632
00:42:59,857 --> 00:43:02,298
Look after him.
Then he'll be all right.

633
00:43:02,299 --> 00:43:04,497
'..Charlie ever does.

634
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:07,056
'Wodehouse was throwing
a cocktail party... '

635
00:43:07,057 --> 00:43:09,976
How can you SAY these things?
Cocktail party?

636
00:43:09,977 --> 00:43:12,898
Plummie never threw a cocktail
party in his life.

637
00:43:12,899 --> 00:43:17,657
He's the shyest, sweetest old...
It'll be all right, darling.

638
00:43:17,658 --> 00:43:23,378
We will get hold of him and manage
this thing and it will be all right.

639
00:43:26,378 --> 00:43:30,056
I've had a cable from my editor
at the Saturday Evening Post.

640
00:43:30,057 --> 00:43:34,098
"Must warn you how badly your talks
are being received here.

641
00:43:37,778 --> 00:43:41,937
"People in America resent
your callous attitude

642
00:43:41,938 --> 00:43:44,338
"to fellow Englishmen."

643
00:43:47,138 --> 00:43:49,577
I was being humourous.

644
00:43:49,578 --> 00:43:52,296
I was trying to show our spirit
wasn't broken.

645
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:56,458
I was trying to show them we were
bloody but unbowed, sort of thing.

646
00:43:56,459 --> 00:43:58,458
I don't understand it.

647
00:44:03,938 --> 00:44:06,577
Have I made a fool of myself?

648
00:44:06,578 --> 00:44:08,737
Of course you haven't, Plum.

649
00:44:08,738 --> 00:44:11,458
All he has done is tell the truth,
hasn't he?

650
00:44:11,459 --> 00:44:15,297
You have simply described
what you saw, Plum.

651
00:44:15,298 --> 00:44:17,898
Telling the truth is not
a crime, is it?

652
00:44:17,899 --> 00:44:21,177
Not in my book.
What's happening, Werner?

653
00:44:21,178 --> 00:44:23,417
It'll all be fine, I'm sure.

654
00:44:23,418 --> 00:44:26,576
You just have to explain why
you're doing them.

655
00:44:26,577 --> 00:44:29,258
I'm not sure I should carry on
doing them at all.

656
00:44:30,578 --> 00:44:34,297
Wouldn't that be admitting
you were wrong, Plum?

657
00:44:34,298 --> 00:44:37,658
You could explain when you give
the next broadcast why you,

658
00:44:37,659 --> 00:44:40,137
you know, decided to speak.

659
00:44:40,138 --> 00:44:42,337
An excellent idea.

660
00:44:42,338 --> 00:44:46,298
This is just a misunderstanding.
I didn't want to offend anyone.

661
00:44:46,299 --> 00:44:48,337
We can get through this.

662
00:44:48,338 --> 00:44:50,818
I've still got to give
two more broadcasts.

663
00:44:51,818 --> 00:44:54,458
Perhaps I shouldn't give
those broadcasts.

664
00:44:57,378 --> 00:45:01,858
I think you owe it
to your American readers, Plum!

665
00:45:02,858 --> 00:45:05,978
Well... there's a fellow
Englishman speaking.

666
00:45:10,138 --> 00:45:13,338
I'm sorry about this, Plum.
I really am.

667
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:18,098
You are not to worry about it.
It'll all blow over.

668
00:45:19,698 --> 00:45:23,578
We can talk about the other
broadcasts when you feel calmer.

669
00:45:24,698 --> 00:45:26,818
When can I see Ethel again?

670
00:45:28,338 --> 00:45:32,018
I'll get her to Berlin. I promise.

671
00:45:39,218 --> 00:45:42,938
We have the English and American
papers, Mrs Wodehouse, if you like.

672
00:45:42,939 --> 00:45:45,178
Du bist ein sweetheart.

673
00:45:54,178 --> 00:45:56,898
Oh, my God! The idiot!

674
00:46:01,538 --> 00:46:03,576
How many hours before
we reach Berlin?

675
00:46:03,577 --> 00:46:05,978
I am afraid it is a matter
of days, Mrs Wodehouse.

676
00:46:05,979 --> 00:46:08,657
Accelerate! I am sorry?

677
00:46:08,658 --> 00:46:14,818
More speed. Faster. Schnell.
Hurry. Quick. Chop-chop. Pacey-pacey.

678
00:46:19,378 --> 00:46:21,018
Do I make myself clear?

679
00:46:22,618 --> 00:46:27,177
The Press and public in England
seem to have jumped to

680
00:46:27,178 --> 00:46:31,017
the conclusion that
I have in some way been bribed or

681
00:46:31,018 --> 00:46:34,417
intimidated into making
these broadcasts.

682
00:46:34,418 --> 00:46:36,498
This is not the case.

683
00:46:37,658 --> 00:46:41,457
I did not "make a bargain"
as they put it

684
00:46:41,458 --> 00:46:45,417
and buy my release by agreeing to
speak on the radio.

685
00:46:45,418 --> 00:46:50,617
I was released because I am 60 years
old, or shall be in October.

686
00:46:50,618 --> 00:46:53,978
The fact that I was free
before that date was due to

687
00:46:53,979 --> 00:46:56,097
the efforts of my friends.

688
00:46:56,098 --> 00:46:58,177
I wanted to thank them,

689
00:46:58,178 --> 00:47:01,777
which is why
I am continuing with these talks.

690
00:47:01,778 --> 00:47:04,337
I have to stop my husband, you see,

691
00:47:04,338 --> 00:47:07,698
from making a fool of himself.
Do you have a wife?

692
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:09,337
I do.

693
00:47:09,338 --> 00:47:12,418
Does she stop you from making
a fool of yourself?

694
00:47:12,419 --> 00:47:14,577
She does, Mrs Wodehouse.

695
00:47:14,578 --> 00:47:17,257
Well, there you are then.

696
00:47:17,258 --> 00:47:20,377
Plus de vitesse. Onward and upward.

697
00:47:20,378 --> 00:47:23,337
Maximum velocity, old bean.

698
00:47:23,338 --> 00:47:26,777
People began to experiment
with foods.

699
00:47:26,778 --> 00:47:31,537
One man used to save
some of his soup at midday,

700
00:47:31,538 --> 00:47:35,937
add jam and eat the result cold
in the evening.

701
00:47:35,938 --> 00:47:39,777
I myself got rather fond
of wooden matchsticks.

702
00:47:39,778 --> 00:47:43,658
You chew them into a pulp
and swallow the result whole.

703
00:47:46,458 --> 00:47:47,577
Wait there!

704
00:47:47,578 --> 00:47:50,777
The morale of the men at Tost
was wonderful.

705
00:47:50,778 --> 00:47:56,418
I never met a more cheerful crowd
and I loved them like brothers.

706
00:47:58,338 --> 00:48:03,217
With this, I bring to an end
the story of my adventures

707
00:48:03,218 --> 00:48:06,857
as British Civilian Prisoner
number 796,

708
00:48:06,858 --> 00:48:10,697
and before concluding,
I should like to thank all

709
00:48:10,698 --> 00:48:15,497
the kind people in America who wrote
me letters when I was in camp.

710
00:48:15,498 --> 00:48:21,297
Nobody who has not been in a prison
camp can realise what letters,

711
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:27,738
especially letters like those I
received, can mean to an internee.

712
00:48:31,338 --> 00:48:32,978
That's it!

713
00:48:34,738 --> 00:48:38,417
Oh, my God! It's the Colonel!

714
00:48:38,418 --> 00:48:41,938
I think she's cross about something.
Probably about me.

715
00:48:41,939 --> 00:48:43,657
She often is.

716
00:48:43,658 --> 00:48:48,137
Oh, brave new world that hath
such creatures in it. Eh, Werner?

717
00:48:48,138 --> 00:48:50,818
What on earth are you thinking
of, Werner?

718
00:48:50,819 --> 00:48:53,818
What shocking mess
have you got him into?

719
00:48:57,458 --> 00:48:59,576
How could you be so bloody stupid?

720
00:48:59,577 --> 00:49:02,456
I find it all too easy
to be stupid, I'm afraid.

721
00:49:02,457 --> 00:49:04,376
Oh, don't give me that line again.

722
00:49:04,377 --> 00:49:07,096
Try it on the rest of the world,
Plummie. I know you.

723
00:49:07,097 --> 00:49:09,136
I'm in love with you for some
peculiar reason

724
00:49:09,137 --> 00:49:10,576
and you are not stupid.

725
00:49:10,577 --> 00:49:13,336
You are a very clever man who is
pretending to be stupid

726
00:49:13,337 --> 00:49:17,856
for some mysterious reason of his
own, which I have never understood.

727
00:49:17,857 --> 00:49:21,136
You can never resist it, can you?
The chance to amuse.

728
00:49:21,137 --> 00:49:24,296
You are what that awful bloody
Irishman called you,

729
00:49:24,297 --> 00:49:26,496
"English literature's
performing flea."

730
00:49:26,497 --> 00:49:29,536
I shall use it as the title
of my autobiography.

731
00:49:29,537 --> 00:49:33,178
Oh shut up, Plummie, for God's sake!
Shut up, can't you?

732
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:34,658
Stop it.

733
00:49:36,978 --> 00:49:41,376
And now it seems Dr Goebbels is
beaming your talks over to Britain.

734
00:49:41,377 --> 00:49:44,456
They've used you, Plummie.
You've been made a fool of.

735
00:49:44,457 --> 00:49:47,098
You passed up a damned good chance
of keeping your mouth shut,

736
00:49:47,099 --> 00:49:48,497
didn't you?

737
00:49:48,498 --> 00:49:52,018
Do you think Werner used me, then?
Of course he bloody did.

738
00:49:52,019 --> 00:49:54,297
Is he Gestapo, do you think?

739
00:49:54,298 --> 00:49:56,178
Oh, for God's sake.

740
00:49:57,778 --> 00:50:01,857
He's a survivor, that's all.
Like me.

741
00:50:01,858 --> 00:50:04,657
I'm sure he does
what the Fuhrer orders.

742
00:50:04,658 --> 00:50:07,057
I thought you liked Werner.

743
00:50:07,058 --> 00:50:11,338
He amuses me. Which is more than
you do at the moment.

744
00:50:14,258 --> 00:50:18,258
I am so sorry.
I'm so terribly sorry.

745
00:50:22,578 --> 00:50:26,418
We could get back to England.
Through Portugal or something.

746
00:50:26,419 --> 00:50:29,337
And I could explain to... to...

747
00:50:29,338 --> 00:50:32,017
To who? Winston Churchill?

748
00:50:32,018 --> 00:50:33,897
King George VI?

749
00:50:33,898 --> 00:50:35,616
I think you may be a fool, actually.

750
00:50:35,617 --> 00:50:38,498
All you're good for is making
stupid jokes and...

751
00:50:43,018 --> 00:50:46,216
Don't look like that. Please.
Don't look like that.

752
00:50:46,217 --> 00:50:48,616
Like what?
Like a dog I've just kicked.

753
00:50:48,617 --> 00:50:50,898
Oh, I could never kick a dog.
It wouldn't be right.

754
00:50:50,899 --> 00:50:52,618
Oh, for God's sake!

755
00:51:01,378 --> 00:51:05,578
I brought your novel. The Jeeves one
you started in Le Touquet.

756
00:51:09,698 --> 00:51:11,858
Oh, you goof!

757
00:51:15,698 --> 00:51:18,137
Am I intruding?

758
00:51:18,138 --> 00:51:20,458
Not at all, Werner.

759
00:51:22,978 --> 00:51:26,936
We should take you out of Berlin.
To the Harz mountains perhaps.

760
00:51:26,937 --> 00:51:30,418
Is there much nightlife
in the Harz mountains, Werner?

761
00:51:30,419 --> 00:51:33,057
Wine, women and song for me.

762
00:51:33,058 --> 00:51:36,218
And I'll be the woman,
if that's all right!

763
00:51:48,098 --> 00:51:51,537
Excuse me. Do I disturb?

764
00:51:51,538 --> 00:51:52,977
Er...

765
00:51:52,978 --> 00:51:56,578
I am anxious to make interview
with Mr PG Wodehouse. Oh.

766
00:51:58,418 --> 00:52:01,057
I'm afraid I'm not talking
to anyone.

767
00:52:01,058 --> 00:52:04,496
I'm just... holed up in this hotel,
trying to write my novel

768
00:52:04,497 --> 00:52:08,738
and waiting for the war to be over.
I admire your work and... Sorry.

769
00:52:10,578 --> 00:52:12,618
I don't talk to people any more.

770
00:52:15,058 --> 00:52:16,578
It isn't safe.

771
00:52:25,658 --> 00:52:28,697
You see that ghastly little man
over there?

772
00:52:28,698 --> 00:52:34,137
That's Lord Haw-Haw. "Chairmany
calling. Chairmany calling."

773
00:52:34,138 --> 00:52:38,377
He really is a fascist.
Werner looks after him, too.

774
00:52:38,378 --> 00:52:41,897
When we win,
they will hang him as a traitor.

775
00:52:41,898 --> 00:52:44,417
And hang me as an aperitif, perhaps?

776
00:52:44,418 --> 00:52:47,737
Plum, please.
I am not afraid, Ethel.

777
00:52:47,738 --> 00:52:51,536
I may have been naive, but I do not
think I have acted as a traitor.

778
00:52:51,537 --> 00:52:54,578
And I hope you do not
believe that is the case, either.

779
00:52:56,178 --> 00:52:58,858
You know I do not. Good.

780
00:53:03,978 --> 00:53:06,977
We have to get out of this
awful place.

781
00:53:06,978 --> 00:53:11,497
Get your friend Werner to get us
out of here. To Paris.

782
00:53:11,498 --> 00:53:13,697
The bombing's getting worse.

783
00:53:13,698 --> 00:53:15,616
And what will we do in Paris?

784
00:53:15,617 --> 00:53:19,018
We will face it out, Ethel.
That is what we will do.

785
00:53:21,378 --> 00:53:24,177
That camp toughened you up,
didn't it?

786
00:53:24,178 --> 00:53:28,777
Maybe it was the camp.
Or maybe it was you.

787
00:53:28,778 --> 00:53:30,416
You are every bit as hard work

788
00:53:30,417 --> 00:53:33,818
as the average concentration
camp guard. Oh, Plum!

789
00:53:47,618 --> 00:53:49,377
God.

790
00:53:49,378 --> 00:53:50,978
You still here?

791
00:53:52,098 --> 00:53:54,616
I was going to say
the same thing to you.

792
00:53:54,617 --> 00:53:56,778
In fact, I am leaving for Paris.

793
00:53:56,779 --> 00:54:00,538
Nice. Escape. Nice.

794
00:54:04,058 --> 00:54:06,978
Looks like our friends are
going to lose this war.

795
00:54:06,979 --> 00:54:10,577
The Germans are not my friends,
Mackintosh.

796
00:54:10,578 --> 00:54:13,618
We both did all right out of them,
didn't we?

797
00:54:13,619 --> 00:54:16,377
Why did they let you out,
Mackintosh?

798
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:19,537
Told you. Because I'm 60. Are you?

799
00:54:19,538 --> 00:54:21,936
I did some work for them.
That was all.

800
00:54:21,937 --> 00:54:24,818
Nothing funny about that.
So did you, didn't you?

801
00:54:24,819 --> 00:54:26,977
All I did was...

802
00:54:26,978 --> 00:54:30,978
You're just as bad as me.
Don't pretend you're any different.

803
00:54:30,979 --> 00:54:33,657
You're just the same as me. Am I?

804
00:54:33,658 --> 00:54:36,898
Don't try and tell me you didn't know
why they let you out.

805
00:54:38,498 --> 00:54:42,738
I didn't. I didn't have a clue.

806
00:54:45,778 --> 00:54:49,736
Famous writer. Full of jolly jokes.
Not like poor little me.

807
00:54:49,737 --> 00:54:52,616
But don't try
and pretend you're any different.

808
00:54:52,617 --> 00:54:55,418
They'll find you out, Wodehouse.
You'll see.

809
00:54:55,419 --> 00:54:57,457
You'll see.

810
00:54:57,458 --> 00:54:59,656
Your pals in camp didn't like me.

811
00:54:59,657 --> 00:55:02,858
Thought I was a bit puff, probably.
Not a regular chap.

812
00:55:02,859 --> 00:55:04,698
But you were kind to me.

813
00:55:06,698 --> 00:55:08,618
Takes one to know one.

814
00:55:10,698 --> 00:55:14,137
Well, I do try to be nice to
people, Mackintosh.

815
00:55:14,138 --> 00:55:15,978
It's a bit of a rule with me.

816
00:55:19,698 --> 00:55:24,497
The world is a lot more complicated
than you imagine it to be.

817
00:55:24,498 --> 00:55:26,498
Old bean.

818
00:55:40,418 --> 00:55:42,737
Where did Plack get us into?

819
00:55:42,738 --> 00:55:45,778
Some hotel.
The Bristol, I think it's called.

820
00:55:49,698 --> 00:55:53,618
You always liked Werner, didn't you?
He was always your sort of chap.

821
00:55:57,738 --> 00:56:00,057
What are you suggesting?

822
00:56:00,058 --> 00:56:01,578
Nothing.

823
00:56:12,458 --> 00:56:14,217
Well...

824
00:56:14,218 --> 00:56:16,577
Well what?

825
00:56:16,578 --> 00:56:20,537
Ask a Nazi to book you an hotel,
you get a Nazi hotel.

826
00:56:20,538 --> 00:56:24,297
I notice it hasn't stopped you
eating the food.

827
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:26,138
Fair comment.

828
00:56:29,178 --> 00:56:34,817
I don't find Werner in the least
attractive. He just amuses me.

829
00:56:34,818 --> 00:56:36,537
Well.

830
00:56:36,538 --> 00:56:39,378
You are not exactly consumed
with interest in that

831
00:56:39,379 --> 00:56:41,298
side of life, are you?

832
00:56:47,858 --> 00:56:51,698
Mumps. That's what did it. Mumps.

833
00:56:54,538 --> 00:56:58,178
Ethel, I have tried everything to
get back to England

834
00:56:58,179 --> 00:57:01,417
and clear my name.
It's all I want to do.

835
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:04,898
Until I do that, I feel I cannot
go on with my life.

836
00:57:06,738 --> 00:57:09,097
I'm writing my novel...

837
00:57:09,098 --> 00:57:10,816
About Stilton Cheesewright.

838
00:57:10,817 --> 00:57:12,498
What are they going to make of that

839
00:57:12,499 --> 00:57:15,337
when all of Europe is being
torn apart?

840
00:57:15,338 --> 00:57:19,618
You're beginning to sound like that
man on the Daily Mirror, old thing.

841
00:57:21,898 --> 00:57:25,096
If I don't clear my name,
I will never have a public again.

842
00:57:25,097 --> 00:57:26,898
It's a matter of life and death.

843
00:57:34,778 --> 00:57:36,296
The Allies will be here any day.

844
00:57:36,297 --> 00:57:40,578
When they arrive, I shall turn
myself in and tell them the truth

845
00:57:40,579 --> 00:57:45,138
and perhaps at last people
will know I am not a traitor.

846
00:57:47,538 --> 00:57:49,057
Messieurs et Mesdames,

847
00:57:49,058 --> 00:57:52,016
si vous voulez descendre en
bas a cause de...

848
00:57:52,017 --> 00:57:54,978
A cause de British planes.
Aren't they a bore?

849
00:57:57,338 --> 00:57:59,618
Merci. S'il vous plait.

850
00:58:23,058 --> 00:58:24,657
Bonjour!

851
00:58:24,658 --> 00:58:27,697
You can speak English, if you prefer.

852
00:58:27,698 --> 00:58:29,257
You speak English?

853
00:58:29,258 --> 00:58:30,497
I do.

854
00:58:30,498 --> 00:58:32,097
Also German, I imagine.

855
00:58:32,098 --> 00:58:34,536
I have been speaking
a lot of German.

856
00:58:34,537 --> 00:58:38,058
But I imagine it will not be
required in the immediate future.

857
00:58:38,059 --> 00:58:40,297
Indeed. What a wicked world. Eh?

858
00:58:40,298 --> 00:58:43,297
A very wicked world, sir.

859
00:58:43,298 --> 00:58:48,097
But I am sure the best side won,
as you English say.

860
00:58:48,098 --> 00:58:50,897
I am looking for PG Wodehouse.

861
00:58:50,898 --> 00:58:52,897
He is in the hotel, sir.

862
00:58:52,898 --> 00:58:55,418
I am Major Muggeridge
of British Intelligence.

863
00:58:55,419 --> 00:58:57,137
Indeed.

864
00:58:57,138 --> 00:58:59,378
I hope Mr Wodehouse
is not in any trouble

865
00:58:59,379 --> 00:59:01,577
with the British authorities.

866
00:59:01,578 --> 00:59:03,457
He is a most popular guest.

867
00:59:03,458 --> 00:59:06,536
I couldn't comment on that.
I'm in Intelligence

868
00:59:06,537 --> 00:59:08,338
and we're never told anything.

869
00:59:10,298 --> 00:59:15,017
I am afraid the lift is broken.
You must use the stairs.

870
00:59:15,018 --> 00:59:16,658
Pas de probleme.

871
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:24,098
Come.

872
00:59:30,858 --> 00:59:33,818
Major Muggeridge.
British Intelligence.

873
00:59:36,298 --> 00:59:39,497
And a novelist,
if I'm not mistaken.

874
00:59:39,498 --> 00:59:42,138
Well...

875
00:59:45,218 --> 00:59:49,857
Although I'm afraid
I'm here on more serious business.

876
00:59:49,858 --> 00:59:52,017
Indeed.

877
00:59:52,018 --> 00:59:55,376
It has been alleged that you have
been in breach of Section One

878
00:59:55,377 --> 00:59:57,218
of the Treachery Act of 1940.

879
00:59:58,778 --> 01:00:00,857
Indeed.

880
01:00:00,858 --> 01:00:03,336
I'm sure you are aware
of the penalties

881
01:00:03,337 --> 01:00:05,338
if found guilty of such an of fence.

882
01:00:07,698 --> 01:00:10,858
I assume we still hang traitors,
don't we?

883
01:00:14,938 --> 01:00:17,698
Or is drawing and quartering
coming back into fashion?

884
01:00:21,938 --> 01:00:24,697
Shall I send down
for a bottle of wine?

885
01:00:24,698 --> 01:00:26,898
A very good notion.

886
01:00:34,738 --> 01:00:37,377
Do they hate me in England?

887
01:00:37,378 --> 01:00:41,817
Not everyone. AA Milne took
a rather dim view.

888
01:00:41,818 --> 01:00:45,578
Hush, hush. Nobody cares Christopher
Robin has fallen downstairs.

889
01:00:45,579 --> 01:00:49,218
Quite. He was supposed to be
a friend of mine.

890
01:00:50,698 --> 01:00:54,098
I can't bear to think what this
is doing to Leonora.

891
01:00:54,099 --> 01:00:58,377
She's...?
My stepdaughter. But I adopted her.

892
01:00:58,378 --> 01:01:01,777
She's been wonderful
in all of this.

893
01:01:01,778 --> 01:01:03,978
Oh, I wish I wasn't going
into hospital.

894
01:01:03,979 --> 01:01:07,177
Darling,
it isn't a serious operation.

895
01:01:07,178 --> 01:01:08,737
It's Plum.

896
01:01:08,738 --> 01:01:11,376
Someone will need to talk to
the politicians and press

897
01:01:11,377 --> 01:01:13,778
and sort it all out
and if I'm not there...

898
01:01:13,779 --> 01:01:16,057
You will be there, darling.

899
01:01:16,058 --> 01:01:18,258
But first of all, you need to rest.

900
01:01:19,938 --> 01:01:22,538
He's an imbecile.
A complete imbecile.

901
01:01:22,539 --> 01:01:25,778
He's a kind of saint. In a way.

902
01:01:27,498 --> 01:01:31,378
You're just worrying
about the operation. That's all.

903
01:01:37,818 --> 01:01:40,858
I've been a fool. An absolute fool.

904
01:01:42,698 --> 01:01:46,138
All I want to do now
is to clear my name.

905
01:01:48,458 --> 01:01:52,337
People have printed lies about me
in the English papers.

906
01:01:52,338 --> 01:01:55,177
I received money from Dr Goebbels.

907
01:01:55,178 --> 01:01:58,858
I threw cocktail parties
for the Nazis. Well, I didn't.

908
01:02:00,138 --> 01:02:03,338
I want to tell the truth
and have it published.

909
01:02:04,898 --> 01:02:07,896
Chap called Major Cussen
will do the interrogation.

910
01:02:07,897 --> 01:02:09,898
Barrister. I'm sure you'll get on.

911
01:02:12,018 --> 01:02:16,457
You're not obliged to say anything,
but whatever you do say

912
01:02:16,458 --> 01:02:20,098
will be taken down and may be used
in evidence against you.

913
01:02:20,099 --> 01:02:21,618
I understand.

914
01:02:25,778 --> 01:02:31,177
I was born in Guildford, Surrey,
on October 15th 1881,

915
01:02:31,178 --> 01:02:34,257
of British born parents.

916
01:02:34,258 --> 01:02:38,296
In 1900, I joined the Hong Kong
and Shanghai Bank in London...

917
01:02:38,297 --> 01:02:40,496
..In 1917 I was rejected
for military service

918
01:02:40,497 --> 01:02:42,136
by the United States authorities

919
01:02:42,137 --> 01:02:44,256
on account of defective eyesight...

920
01:02:44,257 --> 01:02:47,336
..People have said I was paid
by the Germans. I wasn't.

921
01:02:47,337 --> 01:02:50,736
I lived off the royalties from
my books while I was in Germany.

922
01:02:50,737 --> 01:02:54,218
I tried my damndest to get out,
but they wouldn't let me go.

923
01:02:57,898 --> 01:02:59,498
He's up there now.

924
01:03:01,058 --> 01:03:02,818
Will he really be all right?

925
01:03:02,819 --> 01:03:07,657
It'll be fine, Ethel. Great is
the truth and it shall prevail.

926
01:03:07,658 --> 01:03:10,136
I can't think you really
believe that, Malcolm.

927
01:03:10,137 --> 01:03:13,418
Weren't you a journalist?
Unfortunately I was, Ethel.

928
01:03:16,058 --> 01:03:20,337
He wants the truth to be told.
That is the important thing.

929
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:23,178
You have been so kind to us, Malcolm.

930
01:03:34,778 --> 01:03:39,257
I think Lagerfuhrer Buchelt had
been told to sound me out as to

931
01:03:39,258 --> 01:03:43,298
whether I was willing to broadcast,
and he reported to Berlin.

932
01:03:44,498 --> 01:03:49,777
But I did not broadcast in exchange
for being released.

933
01:03:49,778 --> 01:03:53,978
I never had any intention
of assisting the enemy.

934
01:03:57,218 --> 01:04:00,378
And I have been caused a great
deal of pain by my actions.

935
01:04:03,738 --> 01:04:06,458
Can we talk about Mackintosh?

936
01:04:09,618 --> 01:04:11,177
Mackintosh?

937
01:04:11,178 --> 01:04:14,338
He was the man released
at the same time as you.

938
01:04:15,618 --> 01:04:21,097
Mackintosh received the same orders
as myself. He...

939
01:04:21,098 --> 01:04:24,858
We have tracked him down.
And interviewed him.

940
01:04:26,458 --> 01:04:29,578
You say he came with you to
the Foreign Office.

941
01:04:31,538 --> 01:04:34,417
You were put in a hotel room
with him.

942
01:04:34,418 --> 01:04:38,018
I spent a few days locked up
in the Adlon with him.

943
01:04:39,418 --> 01:04:41,737
But...

944
01:04:41,738 --> 01:04:43,538
I couldn't say I knew him.

945
01:04:45,098 --> 01:04:48,258
Why release him at the same time
as you, Mr Wodehouse?

946
01:04:49,858 --> 01:04:51,418
I really have no idea.

947
01:04:53,098 --> 01:04:56,258
He always says, if something bad
happens, the answer is

948
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:59,457
to think of something else,
pretty damn quick.

949
01:04:59,458 --> 01:05:02,818
He isn't equipped for this nasty
little century, is he?

950
01:05:02,819 --> 01:05:06,177
Its lies and cruelties
and distortions.

951
01:05:06,178 --> 01:05:10,018
There have been times when I thought
this business would drag him under.

952
01:05:10,019 --> 01:05:11,098
But...

953
01:05:18,858 --> 01:05:22,377
Life's a musical comedy.
Don't you think?

954
01:05:22,378 --> 01:05:23,978
"Don't let them get you down."

955
01:05:26,018 --> 01:05:27,658
He writes wonderful lyrics.

956
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:33,017
♪ Shove all your worries
in a great big box

957

958
01:05:35,978 --> 01:05:39,337

959
01:05:39,338 --> 01:05:43,217

961
01:05:46,978 --> 01:05:50,617

01:05:50,618 --> 01:05:54,897

963
01:05:54,898 --> 01:05:57,738
♪ And sit on the lid and grin! ♪

964
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:05,216
You see, Mr Wodehouse,
it is clear to me,

965
01:06:05,217 --> 01:06:08,538
and this is what I shall say
in my report, that the

966
01:06:08,539 --> 01:06:13,857
actual text of your broadcasts
is not of a pro-German character.

967
01:06:13,858 --> 01:06:17,297
I cannot tell you how happy
that makes me.

968
01:06:17,298 --> 01:06:18,658
But...

969
01:06:20,858 --> 01:06:22,697
But?

970
01:06:22,698 --> 01:06:26,177
Did you intend to assist the enemy?

971
01:06:26,178 --> 01:06:29,218
If you obtained your release upon
condition that you would broadcast...

972
01:06:29,219 --> 01:06:31,138
I did NOT.

973
01:06:33,298 --> 01:06:37,178
All we need to do is to confirm
your statement to that effect.

974
01:06:38,378 --> 01:06:42,257
I think Werner Plack and
the Lagerfuhrer,

975
01:06:42,258 --> 01:06:46,416
unless they chose to lie, would
confirm that that is the truth.

976
01:06:46,417 --> 01:06:49,576
It is the truth.
As would my fellow internees.

977
01:06:49,577 --> 01:06:52,378
I partly made those broadcasts
to show the world

978
01:06:52,379 --> 01:06:55,017
we were not giving in
to the Germans.

979
01:06:55,018 --> 01:06:57,818
Mr Wodehouse, Plack
and his friends are probably

980
01:06:57,819 --> 01:07:00,097
dodging masonry in Berlin.

981
01:07:00,098 --> 01:07:03,176
All we have is the evidence of
this man Mackintosh.

982
01:07:03,177 --> 01:07:07,018
He has been arrested and is in
a military prison in Belgium.

983
01:07:10,378 --> 01:07:12,298
Shall we continue this tomorrow?

984
01:07:14,818 --> 01:07:17,898
I am only concerned to make sure
all the evidence in this case

985
01:07:17,899 --> 01:07:21,897
is made public.
So that my name may be cleared.

986
01:07:21,898 --> 01:07:23,498
I fully appreciate that.

987
01:07:24,938 --> 01:07:28,617
Oh, by the way, huge fan of Jeeves.

988
01:07:28,618 --> 01:07:30,258
Thank you.

989
01:07:38,938 --> 01:07:42,056
I've been reading your stuff again.
Marvellous.

990
01:07:42,057 --> 01:07:46,018
"She had a laugh like a troop of
cavalry charging over a tin bridge."

991
01:07:46,019 --> 01:07:47,857
Marvellous.

992
01:07:47,858 --> 01:07:49,818
Are you OK?

993
01:07:51,658 --> 01:07:54,977
Cussen's a reasonable man.
It's going your way.

994
01:07:54,978 --> 01:07:58,778
All we need to do is to set out
the true facts before the public.

995
01:07:58,779 --> 01:08:01,537
Then you can go back to England
and...

996
01:08:01,538 --> 01:08:03,298
What are THEY after?

997
01:08:05,378 --> 01:08:07,577
Monsieur Wodenhorse?

998
01:08:07,578 --> 01:08:09,298
The name is Wodehouse.

999
01:08:11,658 --> 01:08:14,098
May I ask what the charge is,
Inspector?

1000
01:08:14,099 --> 01:08:15,937
The charge is treason.

1001
01:08:15,938 --> 01:08:18,818
A charge of which I suspect
the entire French bloody nation

1002
01:08:18,819 --> 01:08:20,257
might well be guilty.

1003
01:08:20,258 --> 01:08:22,538
The prefect of Paris has ordered it.

1004
01:08:24,338 --> 01:08:27,498
You are not taking my husband
anywhere, you disgusting little men!

1005
01:08:27,499 --> 01:08:28,737
Excuse me.

1006
01:08:28,738 --> 01:08:31,416
You will hear from the
British Government on this question.

1007
01:08:31,417 --> 01:08:33,216
Winston Churchill. Heard of him?

1008
01:08:33,217 --> 01:08:35,656
I seem to remember
he was about the only person who

1009
01:08:35,657 --> 01:08:38,976
gave your bloody General de Gaulle
a place to sleep in 1940.

1010
01:08:38,977 --> 01:08:40,178
Come back here at once!

1011
01:08:40,179 --> 01:08:42,457
This man is not a traitor!

1012
01:08:42,458 --> 01:08:44,417
You will hear from me!

1013
01:08:44,418 --> 01:08:47,578
Oh, FUCK the French!

1014
01:08:50,778 --> 01:08:53,697
Je ne will pas
get off the bloody line!

1015
01:08:53,698 --> 01:08:58,537
I do not move! I talk!
You loathsome little frog!

1016
01:08:58,538 --> 01:09:00,377
You bastards!

1017
01:09:00,378 --> 01:09:03,416
Major Malcolm Muggeridge.
British Intelligence Office.

1018
01:09:03,417 --> 01:09:06,456
I demand to know why this British
subject has been detained.

1019
01:09:06,457 --> 01:09:08,818
In the name of
the British Government!

1020
01:09:08,819 --> 01:09:10,257
'We keep Wodenhorse.'

1021
01:09:10,258 --> 01:09:11,896
You cannot keep this man in prison.

1022
01:09:11,897 --> 01:09:14,298
There will be a diplomatic incident.
I am serious.

1023
01:09:14,299 --> 01:09:17,617
'Is Monsieur Widdenhose well?'

1024
01:09:17,618 --> 01:09:18,977
He's fine.

1025
01:09:18,978 --> 01:09:20,896
'He does not look well to me.'

1026
01:09:20,897 --> 01:09:23,936
'I think if we have him examined
by a doctor he would say

1027
01:09:23,937 --> 01:09:26,778
'we should put him
in a hospital for... a few days.'

1028
01:09:26,779 --> 01:09:29,177
Perfect diplomatic compromise.

1029
01:09:29,178 --> 01:09:31,376
Talleyrand would have been
proud of you.

1030
01:09:31,377 --> 01:09:33,696
Please make sure
it is a nice hospital.

1031
01:09:33,697 --> 01:09:36,576
'So long as I do not have to talk
to his wife again,

1032
01:09:36,577 --> 01:09:38,218
'I am yours for ever, Monsieur.'

1033
01:09:38,219 --> 01:09:40,218
Merci. Au revoir.

1034
01:09:55,738 --> 01:09:58,177
How's the novel?

1035
01:09:58,178 --> 01:10:01,777
Ah! Well, it's seen me
through the war.

1036
01:10:01,778 --> 01:10:05,016
All I need is a publisher.
That's all a novel needs.

1037
01:10:05,017 --> 01:10:07,538
You send it out into the world
like a young chap going off

1038
01:10:07,539 --> 01:10:09,337
to boarding school.

1039
01:10:09,338 --> 01:10:11,618
As soon as I've
convinced the public

1040
01:10:11,619 --> 01:10:15,978
I am not a raving fascist,
I'm sure all will go well.

1041
01:10:18,338 --> 01:10:20,817
What on earth is this place?

1042
01:10:20,818 --> 01:10:24,057
This is the only hospital
they could find.

1043
01:10:24,058 --> 01:10:27,057
A maternity ward.
Isn't it extraordinary?

1044
01:10:27,058 --> 01:10:29,178
I started the war
in a lunatic asylum

1045
01:10:29,179 --> 01:10:32,017
and I am ending it
in a nursing home!

1046
01:10:32,018 --> 01:10:34,137
Well, we'll get you out.

1047
01:10:34,138 --> 01:10:37,497
Churchill did send a note to them,
apparently.

1048
01:10:37,498 --> 01:10:38,976
He's not your biggest fan,

1049
01:10:38,977 --> 01:10:41,538
but he doesn't want to give you
to the French.

1050
01:10:42,938 --> 01:10:46,738
Was it Waugh who called him
a second-rate radio personality?

1051
01:10:47,898 --> 01:10:49,697
Or was it me?

1052
01:10:49,698 --> 01:10:51,816
I'll go back to London
for a few days.

1053
01:10:51,817 --> 01:10:55,216
Get some official letters.
Sort these blighters out.

1054
01:10:55,217 --> 01:10:57,498
I'll get in touch
with your stepdaughter.

1055
01:10:57,499 --> 01:10:59,017
Daughter.

1056
01:10:59,018 --> 01:11:02,096
Sorry, daughter. I am sure Leonora
has some good political contacts.

1057
01:11:02,097 --> 01:11:04,778
She'll help us
get the Cussen report out there.

1058
01:11:06,338 --> 01:11:10,218
Perhaps I could bring you some
tobacco, food parcels.

1059
01:11:12,138 --> 01:11:17,018
We would love news of Leonora.
We haven't heard for ages.

1060
01:11:18,938 --> 01:11:21,258
We'll have dinner when I come back.

1061
01:11:30,858 --> 01:11:33,176
Ah! Cheer up, Malcolm. We're buying.

1062
01:11:33,177 --> 01:11:37,658
If it wasn't for you, I'd still be
in that blasted maternity home.

1063
01:11:37,659 --> 01:11:39,778
I'm glad you're out, anyway.

1064
01:11:45,778 --> 01:11:47,978
Did you manage to track down Leonora?

1065
01:11:47,979 --> 01:11:49,018
I...

1066
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:56,977
This is very hard to say.

1067
01:11:56,978 --> 01:11:58,698
I'm so fond of you both.

1068
01:12:00,018 --> 01:12:03,018
I'm afraid I discovered
that Leonora...

1069
01:12:07,218 --> 01:12:09,018
She went in for an operation.

1070
01:12:10,258 --> 01:12:12,097
All well, Leonora?

1071
01:12:12,098 --> 01:12:13,978
Just fine. Fine.

1072
01:12:19,178 --> 01:12:21,578
A minor operation.

1073
01:12:24,498 --> 01:12:27,458
And I'm afraid she died
under the anaesthetic.

1074
01:12:37,458 --> 01:12:39,778
I thought she was immortal.

1075
01:12:44,858 --> 01:12:46,737
I'll leave you.

1076
01:12:46,738 --> 01:12:50,098
As soon as I know more about
Cussen's report, I'll tell you.

1077
01:12:54,578 --> 01:12:57,338
I am so, so sorry.

1078
01:13:05,818 --> 01:13:10,578
Why this? Why this
on top of everything else?

1079
01:13:11,978 --> 01:13:13,858
Is there a God?

1080
01:13:16,338 --> 01:13:18,298
Why could he let this happen?

1081
01:13:21,058 --> 01:13:26,338
I don't understand.
I just don't understand.

1082
01:13:38,378 --> 01:13:41,018
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1083
01:14:16,818 --> 01:14:18,497
Are you all right?

1084
01:14:18,498 --> 01:14:21,698
I don't know, Malcolm.
I really don't know.

1085
01:14:22,978 --> 01:14:26,378
I suppose with all the awful things
that've happened...

1086
01:14:28,818 --> 01:14:30,498
I don't know.

1087
01:14:32,258 --> 01:14:36,737
I suppose I think they can't
do anything worse to us than that.

1088
01:14:36,738 --> 01:14:39,057
No. Although...

1089
01:14:39,058 --> 01:14:41,578
Don't tell me. They have?

1090
01:14:43,378 --> 01:14:44,857
I tell you, Malcolm,

1091
01:14:44,858 --> 01:14:48,337
walking the plank might come as
a blessed relief,

1092
01:14:48,338 --> 01:14:50,098
after losing Leonora.

1093
01:14:51,658 --> 01:14:54,737
She would have sorted
all this out, you see.

1094
01:14:54,738 --> 01:14:58,097
She knew about politics
and all of that.

1095
01:14:58,098 --> 01:15:03,417
One of the reasons I adopted her
as my own was I just...

1096
01:15:03,418 --> 01:15:04,658
I loved her.

1097
01:15:18,618 --> 01:15:21,097
What have they decided?

1098
01:15:21,098 --> 01:15:26,858
Well... As we expected,
they've cleared you of treachery.

1099
01:15:28,538 --> 01:15:30,338
Thank God for that!

1100
01:15:31,898 --> 01:15:36,058
I hope some of them will apologise
for all the things they said.

1101
01:15:36,059 --> 01:15:38,938
Yes, this is the difficult bit.

1102
01:15:41,418 --> 01:15:44,016
The government line is that you
will not be prosecuted.

1103
01:15:44,017 --> 01:15:46,138
And they have made that public
in answer to

1104
01:15:46,139 --> 01:15:48,938
a House of Commons question. But...

1105
01:15:53,338 --> 01:15:56,978
I don't think they will ever make
the Cussen report public.

1106
01:15:58,018 --> 01:16:00,217
But... that is absurd.

1107
01:16:00,218 --> 01:16:03,898
That means everyone will think
Plum did something wrong,

1108
01:16:03,899 --> 01:16:05,457
even though he didn't.

1109
01:16:05,458 --> 01:16:08,336
He has been cleared.
Why can't we tell the world?

1110
01:16:08,337 --> 01:16:10,376
I did something foolish, I suppose.

1111
01:16:10,377 --> 01:16:13,936
Oh, you're a complete idiot. Everyone
in the Western world knows that.

1112
01:16:13,937 --> 01:16:17,256
It is the secret of your success.
But you are not a traitor.

1113
01:16:17,257 --> 01:16:20,056
You haven't got the background
knowledge to be a traitor.

1114
01:16:20,057 --> 01:16:21,936
All you did was make a few jokes.

1115
01:16:21,937 --> 01:16:23,896
I thought British people
were supposed to

1116
01:16:23,897 --> 01:16:26,096
keep their sense of humour
in times of crisis.

1117
01:16:26,097 --> 01:16:28,978
Or did that go out of the window
along with everything else?

1118
01:16:28,979 --> 01:16:33,457
In war, truth is the first casualty.
Who said that?

1119
01:16:33,458 --> 01:16:36,778
Stop being so bloody brave, Plummie.
I can't bear it.

1120
01:16:42,258 --> 01:16:43,978
Did they say why?

1121
01:16:46,258 --> 01:16:52,057
To do with this fellow Mackintosh.
I shouldn't be telling you this.

1122
01:16:52,058 --> 01:16:55,297
Classified. But...

1123
01:16:55,298 --> 01:16:58,656
It seems they think he may
have been a collaborator.

1124
01:16:58,657 --> 01:17:01,338
Or he may have been one of ours
who was turned.

1125
01:17:01,339 --> 01:17:03,737
I have no idea.

1126
01:17:03,738 --> 01:17:07,697
He left England
because of some homosexual scandal

1127
01:17:07,698 --> 01:17:11,817
and turns up in Boulogne
just before the war started.

1128
01:17:11,818 --> 01:17:13,098
Who knows what he is?

1129
01:17:13,099 --> 01:17:17,817
He's told all sorts of obvious lies,
about being mistaken

1130
01:17:17,818 --> 01:17:21,298
for someone called Mackenzie
who was known to be pro-German.

1131
01:17:21,299 --> 01:17:25,977
But don't believe Mr Mackintosh.
He was cosy enough with the Nazis.

1132
01:17:25,978 --> 01:17:30,537
He spent the war translating
German marching songs

1133
01:17:30,538 --> 01:17:33,177
and a couple of anti-Semitic books.

1134
01:17:33,178 --> 01:17:37,738
German marching songs, eh?
Well, I never.

1135
01:17:39,338 --> 01:17:41,578
Until they decide what to
do with him,

1136
01:17:41,579 --> 01:17:44,577
it appears the file will
remain top secret,

1137
01:17:44,578 --> 01:17:46,378
with his name blanked out.

1138
01:17:50,018 --> 01:17:52,498
Once again, I am so sorry.

1139
01:17:53,658 --> 01:17:56,576
I'm not forbidden to return
to England, I suppose.

1140
01:17:56,577 --> 01:18:00,176
I cannot see why you should be.
You have to show them.

1141
01:18:00,177 --> 01:18:03,376
You have to let them know you're
not going to lie down under this.

1142
01:18:03,377 --> 01:18:05,938
I think dignified silence
will be my policy.

1143
01:18:07,658 --> 01:18:10,416
My novels seem to be
all right over in America.

1144
01:18:10,417 --> 01:18:12,456
Shall we see if they'll have us?

1145
01:18:12,457 --> 01:18:14,656
I am obviously not welcome
in the land of my birth.

1146
01:18:14,657 --> 01:18:16,938
You mustn't let them browbeat you,
Plummie!

1147
01:18:16,939 --> 01:18:19,937
I will do what I will do,
my darling.

1148
01:18:19,938 --> 01:18:22,098
My head is bloody, but unbowed.

1149
01:18:23,978 --> 01:18:27,618
Can it get worse after what
happened to Leonora?

1150
01:18:28,898 --> 01:18:33,018
Of course it can.
Sunt lacrimae rerum and all that.

1151
01:18:34,538 --> 01:18:37,936
If the classics have taught me
one thing it is that Fate is

1152
01:18:37,937 --> 01:18:40,738
always waiting for you with
the stuffed eel-skin.

1153
01:18:42,458 --> 01:18:45,378
But you can't let them
see what life does to you.

1154
01:18:45,379 --> 01:18:49,417
That's the only way to survive it.
To shut up.

1155
01:18:49,418 --> 01:18:54,017
Which is what, after all this,
I propose to do.

1156
01:18:54,018 --> 01:18:57,378
There is a certain dignity
in silence.

1157
01:18:58,418 --> 01:19:02,418
I do not wish
to speak about this any more.

1158
01:19:04,378 --> 01:19:08,097
You have been so kind to us.

1159
01:19:08,098 --> 01:19:13,258
And now, if you will excuse me,
I will go back and write.

1160
01:19:14,378 --> 01:19:21,538
About creatures of the night such
as bats, cats and Constable Potter.

1161
01:19:28,418 --> 01:19:31,058
Those of us who care will try
and set the record straight.

1162
01:19:31,059 --> 01:19:35,297
I know, Malcolm. Thank you.
You won't ever succeed now.

1163
01:19:35,298 --> 01:19:38,057
Not until we too are dead, I suspect.

1164
01:19:38,058 --> 01:19:40,578
But thank you for even
thinking of trying.

1165
01:19:51,618 --> 01:19:53,857
America, here you come.

1166
01:19:53,858 --> 01:19:55,337
Indeed.

1167
01:19:55,338 --> 01:19:57,858
But you will pay England
a visit, I hope.

1168
01:19:57,859 --> 01:20:02,378
Perhaps. I long and dread
to see it again.

1169
01:20:07,538 --> 01:20:09,618
My sort of England has vanished.

1170
01:20:10,698 --> 01:20:13,138
It is as extinct as the maiden aunt.

1171
01:20:14,298 --> 01:20:16,257
But we need it.

1172
01:20:16,258 --> 01:20:17,538
Maybe.

1173
01:20:33,138 --> 01:20:34,937
Goodbye, dear boy.

1174
01:20:34,938 --> 01:20:36,538
To clear your name.

1175
01:20:37,658 --> 01:20:41,937
Alea jacta est,
as Caesar used to say.

1176
01:20:41,938 --> 01:20:43,818
When in a difficult mood...

1177
01:20:46,698 --> 01:20:48,378
..farewell.

1178
01:21:02,098 --> 01:21:07,098
Oh, England. What do you do to
those who love you?

1179
01:21:55,287 --> 01:22:24,320
