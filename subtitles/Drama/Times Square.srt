1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,380
Loving You a Thousand Times

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,950
Who is it?

4
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:20,630
Oh my, what brings you here?

5
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:29,710
I have something you need to hear.

6
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,900
For me?

7
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,560
Yes.

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,370
Why don't we go inside?
The weather is cold.

9
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:40,580
No.

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,480
Let's just talk out here.

11
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:53,190
Go Eun Nim and her husband said they'd divorce,

12
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,920
But she's come back.

13
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,400
Please stop it.

14
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,040
What?

15
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,620
No, what is that supposed to mean?

16
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:08,860
Go Eun Nim is a person who can't be in our family.

17
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,720
Why are you saying these things?

18
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,990
What in the world has our Eun Nim done wrong?

19
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,290
Yes. She's done something wrong.

20
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:22,270
Something that is so huge, I can't say it.

21
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,710
Then, I must know what it is so I can determine

22
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,260
whether they should be apart or together.

23
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,890
You really don't know anything.

24
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,610
Your daughter...

25
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,070
...was a surrogate mother.

26
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,660
S-Surrogate mother?

27
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:47,870
Are you meaning a person giving
birth to a child? Our Eun Nim?

28
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:49,570
Yes.

29
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:54,080
No, why are you telling lies that don't
even make sense right now?

30
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,140
As to whether it makes sense or not,
ask your daughter about it.

31
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,270
Right now, inside our house,
it's chaotic because of her.

32
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,550
That's why I came to find you.

33
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,450
No...

34
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,980
No, what are you talking about?

35
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:14,330
My father and grandmother don't know
about this, so they let her come back.

36
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,890
But, my mother couldn't say anything...

37
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:19,070
She's sick and lying down as a result.

38
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,210
Please detach Eun Nim and her husband.

39
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:28,090
No, what are you talking about, huh?

40
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,450
No, where did you get such slander?

41
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,480
Our Eun Nim did what?

42
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:36,340
Then, please do me this favor.

43
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,710
No, that...that...!

44
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:43,750
Honey, honey, are you all right?

45
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,390
Honey! Oh, god, this guy, really...!

46
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,620
I'm asking if you're all right, honey!

47
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,690
I'm all right, I'm all right.

48
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,190
Honey, don't believe her words.

49
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,360
I'll go over there and ask again. Huh?

50
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,790
Hey, look at me.

51
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,680
You won't stay still?

52
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,670
You. I told you to stop.

53
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,990
Why are you like this?

54
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,410
What? Why are you like this...?

55
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:46,730
You left my house  in chaos,
and yet you're asking why I'm like this?

56
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:51,190
Tell me again. Our Eun Nim did what?

57
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,050
Don't do this to me.

58
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,900
Call your daughter and ask her instead.

59
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:58,670
Hey. It was you who wanted a surrogate mother.

60
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,790
You used the surrogate mother to give yourself a child.

61
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,610
Then, how could you be like this and cause
disruption in our house, disruptively?

62
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,960
What did you say?

63
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,170
Do you think it's because I don't have
a mouth that I'm staying quiet?

64
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,480
You're in-laws. It's because
you're my daughter's friend.

65
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,500
Though I wanted to prattle,
I stayed quiet and endured it!

66
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,970
I can tell your mother you got a surrogate
mother to give birth to your child.

67
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,640
Should I just reveal that all to her?

68
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,530
Ahjumma...

69
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,650
Ahjumma, how did you...?

70
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:27,770
That's why, if you're scared of my mouth,
allow Eun Nim and her husband, Baek,

71
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:30,190
to live a steady life.

72
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:33,200
And don't spread rumors and lies about
Eun Nim being a surrogate mother.

73
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,630
Ahjumma.

74
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,500
But, our Yoo Bin came from her.

75
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,910
So, what now?

76
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,280
What?

77
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,550
You...What did you just say?

78
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,420
So, why are you making me say these things?

79
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,630
You can just be satisfied with what you already know!

80
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,610
Hey.

81
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,220
A-A-Are you crazy?

82
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,090
How can you say words with such absurdity?

83
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,350
No. The crazy one is Eun Nim.

84
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,900
Is getting back together with her husband not crazy?

85
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:17,520
You...Even if you hate Eun Nim to the extreme,
you shouldn't spit out nonsense!

86
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,700
Our Eun Nim bore a baby.

87
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,980
And not just any child, but yours?

88
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:27,740
I haven't seen Eun Nim pregnant.

89
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,150
Think about it well.

90
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:32,470
Why? Why would Eun Nim do something like that, why?

91
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:34,500
How would I know that?

92
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,930
Perhaps she did it because she was in need of money.

93
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,370
What?

94
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,460
Money?

95
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:47,930
I contacted the donor and paid the bill for dad's surgery.

96
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,990
No...! Where did you suddenly get
such a large sum of money?

97
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:52,710
That...

98
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:55,770
A senior of mine from college loaned me money.

99
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,280
My friend told me to pay him back some other time.

100
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:05,330
Mom, I have money aside from the surgery fee,
so use it to find a house.

101
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,030
After dad's out of the hospital, we can't not have a house.

102
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:18,740
Do me this favor, Ahjumma. Please have
Eun Nim and her husband divorce.

103
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,620
It must happen.

104
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:43,870
You must be so happy.

105
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:48,170
I'm talking about you and your husband going
to the States and living there together.

106
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,100
It really turned out great!

107
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,200
Yes, Dad?

108
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:05,450
For a moment, come by the house.

109
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:08,470
Dad, what's wrong with your voice?

110
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,160
Did something happen at home?

111
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,460
If I say to come now, just come.
You can come, right?

112
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,260
Yes, I understand.

113
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:26,630
Where did you just call?

114
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,060
To Eun Nim.

115
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,730
What are you going to say to her?

116
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,930
And she just recently got into that house, too.

117
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,970
Of course I have to ask her!

118
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:39,970
After hearing that, do you think I can just stay still?

119
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,570
I don't want to! You do the surgery!

120
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,230
Why are you doing this, seriously?

121
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,750
I can't do it, that's why I'm like this!

122
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,390
I don't want to! I'm telling you that I'm scared.

123
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,200
I'm sorry, unni.

124
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:18,690
Unni, I know that you're scared.
But, our dad, if not for you, will die.

125
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:21,080
Unni, unni!

126
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,850
I'm kneeling like this, please!
Please save our dad.

127
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:30,420
Mom, what's with her?
Tell her not to be like this...

128
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:34,470
Unni, if you save our dad,
I'll only live for you.

129
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:37,300
I'll do everything for your sake.
So, please, Unni...

130
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,790
You're not going to stop?

131
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,740
I don't want to. I'm never going to stop.

132
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,340
Please just stop, hurry!

133
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,280
He's going to China for a year?

134
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,660
Sunbae has a lot of work and seems to be really busy.

135
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,400
As for the money, for a year, I'll be helping him.

136
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,290
Then...

137
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,950
At the time, the surgery fee.

138
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,310
The surgery fee.

139
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:16,160
She did it for her father's surgery fee?

140
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:24,350
Oh my word...

141
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,320
What do we do?
What do we do?

142
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,190
You just came now?

143
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,050
For having something to do, you came early.

144
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:45,600
Yes.

145
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:54,030
I'll be going to my parents' house.

146
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,920
What, parents' house?

147
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:02,580
You, go and please don't ever come back.

148
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,800
I'll be going.

149
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,670
Just look at that girl! She's so rude.

150
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:20,600
Mother, just let her do what she pleases.

151
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,390
You have something to say to me, don't you?

152
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,930
W-What?

153
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,890
You told them about the surrogate mother situation?

154
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,410
Yes.

155
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:42,310
When you said you had something
you had to do earlier, that was it?

156
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:47,070
Now, everything will be cleaned up.
Since her father knows.

157
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,210
Do you think he'd leave this alone?

158
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,930
But still, how could you...?

159
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:59,280
Then, what was I to do? Should I have let those two be?

160
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:04,710
I can't do that. I'm doing this to have Yoo Bin in this house.

161
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,520
That may be true, but...

162
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,880
What would you like for dinner?

163
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:15,110
Should I make Gu Jeol Pan* that you like
so much, but haven't had in a while?

164
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:15,110
<i>{\a6}(*Pancake wrap dish with 8 sides)</i>

165
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,340
Sure.

166
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,770
Mom!

167
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,750
What are you doing here?

168
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,240
Come see me.

169
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,930
But, dad said to come and see him.

170
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,100
First, come talk with me.

171
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,230
Y-You.

172
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,660
Four years earlier,

173
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:14,640
when you said you were going to China for a year.

174
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,700
Where were you, and what were you doing?

175
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,760
Why are you suddenly wondering?

176
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,890
Seeing that I know everything, tell me the truth.

177
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:36,120
Did you really, at that time,
give birth to a child? Huh?

178
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,780
Mom...

179
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:51,770
For your dad's surgery fees, and money for the house,
was that the money from giving birth to a child?

180
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,580
Mom, how did you...?

181
00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:01,620
And that child is Yoo Bin? Huh?

182
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,670
Mom...

183
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:12,910
Aigoo! Why did you, why did you?
Aigoo! Why did you do it? Why?

184
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:22,180
Aigoo, what could we do now?
Aigoo, it'd be nice if I knew what to do!

185
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:31,260
Then, where were you during your pregnancy?

186
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,400
There.

187
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,780
In Paju.

188
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,720
What we supposed to do? What can we do?

189
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,750
You're saying that you were
in Paju during your pregnancy?

190
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,520
What are we going to do...?

191
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,000
It's difficult enough to have a baby.

192
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,950
How did you...

193
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:57,830
No, since you were all alone, how much
you would have suffered through.

194
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:02,540
When you're carrying a child,
there should be many things to eat.

195
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,750
Are you an orphan, huh?
You don't have a mom or dad?

196
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:18,160
Even if you wanted your dad to live that badly,
and even if you were single at the time,

197
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,020
how could you do this?

198
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:25,590
I don't know anymore.
I think I'm going crazy.

199
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:34,020
No. It's not a time to be crying right now.

200
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:44,450
Then, the reason to divorce
or not is all because of this?

201
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:52,490
It'd be nice to know what to do, it'd really be nice.

202
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:59,370
Then, your husband, Baek, knows about this?

203
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:08,330
Even though he knows,
your husband is still okay with it?

204
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,900
Then, it's fine. Huh? Then, it's fine.
Stop crying. Don't cry.

205
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,300
Do as I say. Listen to me.

206
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,280
First off, do what your husband wants to do.

207
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,210
Kang Ho wants to go to the States together.

208
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:35,990
Mom, I want that, too.

209
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,540
But, I'm scared.

210
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,420
Can l do that?

211
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,600
You have to go.

212
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,290
No matter what others say,
don't pay attention to it,

213
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,770
and go with your husband.

214
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:58,650
What do I do?

215
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,280
I haven't done a single thing for you.

216
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:13,870
Eun Nim, now, I can help you, so don't worry.

217
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:18,170
Just go straight to the States
with your husband. Okay?

218
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:24,510
Okay. Okay, it's okay, it's okay!

219
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:27,560
It's okay,

220
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,780
That's right, cry as loud as you want.

221
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:42,170
Our Eun Nim, it's okay. Cry a lot!

222
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:12,200
Go over there.

223
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,750
But, I have to see dad before I go.

224
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,870
Your dad?

225
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:20,610
Hey, your eyes are swollen from crying. You can't.

226
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:23,520
Listen to me well and go.

227
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:28,390
By any chance, did Dad want
to see me because of this?

228
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,750
Does dad know everything, too?

229
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,710
No, that's not it.
Your dad doesn't know a thing.

230
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:35,910
So, go and don't worry.

231
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:39,540
If he sees your face swollen, he'll be even more worried.

232
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,490
Are you like this because you don't
know your dad's personality?

233
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,800
Come back tomorrow.

234
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,320
Okay.

235
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,520
It'd be great if I knew what to do.

236
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,160
If only Nam Jung had done the surgery instead.

237
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:32,840
I feel like I'm going crazy. I want to die...

238
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,500
Later, when I die and meet Eun Nim's mom in heaven,

239
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:45,050
she can pull my hair out and I wouldn't
be able to say anything to her...

240
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:48,610
I don't have anything to say!

241
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,730
Why are you standing like that?

242
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,190
Why isn't Eun Nim coming? It's already past
the time she was supposed to come.

243
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:06,230
Don't call her.

244
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:08,220
Eun Nim isn't going to come.

245
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,850
I met her up in the front.

246
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:13,270
I told her to just go.

247
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,060
Why would you tell her to go?
I had intentionally called her here.

248
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:20,110
Why, what? What is it that you want to tell her?

249
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,750
Were you going to ask her about that thing earlier?

250
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:27,460
I just have to ask her!

251
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,560
Is it a must to really ask her?

252
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,450
That's right, that's right.

253
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:37,990
Eun Nim earned money by giving birth
to a kid. That's right.

254
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,470
What?

255
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,800
Are you being serious?

256
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,720
Seriously?

257
00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:46,980
That's right!

258
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,440
How could a person do that?

259
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,350
Why would you think Eun Nim
would do something like that?

260
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:02,550
She did it to save you.
She did it to save you!

261
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,250
What does that mean?

262
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:11,110
When you were ill, where do you
think the money came from?

263
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,270
Then, that money...

264
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,470
Eun Nim did...!

265
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,220
That's not it.

266
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:24,980
Then, what you're saying is...!

267
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,150
That's right, you're right.
That money is that money.

268
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,440
Where in the world could you find a person
who'd lend you that much, isn't that right?

269
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,520
And we just believed in what she told us...

270
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,020
Honey, honey, come back to your senses! Honey.

271
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,620
We can't lose our senses, huh?

272
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,720
Then...Then that child is...

273
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,000
The child?

274
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,410
The child's probably doing well.

275
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:03,320
Honey. Eun Nim doesn't know that you know.

276
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,920
I said that you don't know.

277
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,240
You know what I'm trying to say, don't you?

278
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,560
So, you can never show it in front
of Eun Nim, you understand?

279
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,340
Eun Nim and husband Baek are back together again now.

280
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:25,540
Truthfully, if Eun Nim knows that you know,

281
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:30,460
you can imagine how uncomfortable her heart would be.

282
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:38,430
Then, that's the reason why Eun Nim was to get a divorce?

283
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:44,780
But, her husband understands it all.
He will forgive her.

284
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:52,030
But, her sister-in-law knows,
and her mother-in-law, as well.

285
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:56,910
Eun Nim must be going through
such a difficult time in that house.

286
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:00,610
Let's tell our Eun Nim to leave that house.

287
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:04,610
Did you not hear a single thing I just said?

288
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:10,830
Her husband understands, and they're going to live in the States.

289
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:16,340
So, that's why, honey, let's just keep
our mouths closed, and act like we don't know.

290
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,460
Do you understand, honey?

291
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,130
What am I to do about this?

292
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,300
Eun Nim!

293
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,420
But, how did Mom know?

294
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,630
Possibly...

295
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,320
Did that Ahjumma, because of money...?

296
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:28,160
It's me.

297
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,250
Where are you?
Are you at home?

298
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:34,220
I went out to my parents' for a little while,
but I'm on my way back.

299
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,140
Kang Ho, does your body feel better now?

300
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,890
Now, I'm strong.

301
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,720
Then, let's meet up before we go in.

302
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,710
Okay.

303
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,800
Then, I'll see you there.

304
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:06,560
So, you're taking your wife out to dinner?

305
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,110
Okay, I got it.

306
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:11,140
Buy her something delicious.

307
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,430
Okay.

308
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,360
Was that Kang Ho?

309
00:24:18,010 --> 00:24:20,980
Him and his wife are going on a date.

310
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,960
A d-date?

311
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,490
What's with your facial expression?

312
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:29,240
It's been a long time for them.

313
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,970
The two of them can't go on dates or anything?

314
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,750
No, no.

315
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:36,200
When did I say that?

316
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,720
Before long, they're going to the United States.

317
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:46,420
It'd sure be nice if you could treat
them well before they leave.

318
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:55,310
Wh-wh-wh-what just happened?

319
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:57,250
She said she was going to her parents' house.

320
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,960
Is it that she went someplace else?

321
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,380
Well, that...

322
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:05,700
Mother, just wait a little.

323
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:47,330
Oh my.

324
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:49,500
Who is it?

325
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:52,350
What do you mean by who is it?

326
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,450
What was that? You startled me.

327
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:59,380
You didn't know your husband was coming.
What kind of thoughts were you having?

328
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:01,920
Nothing.

329
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,180
Don't think too much.

330
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,810
They say that thinking too much isn't a good thing.

331
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:12,960
Someone said that you need to let go of your thoughts
and materialism in order to lead a comfortable life.

332
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:15,620
That's why being simple is the best.

333
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:20,600
Look at you, making your own interpretation
of wise sayings again.

334
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,500
But, was there something going on
at your parents' house?

335
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,250
Your face looks swollen.

336
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,630
Did you cry?

337
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:38,930
What do you mean by crying? That's not it.

338
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,940
I'm starving.

339
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:46,880
What should we eat?

340
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,640
It's been a long time since we've eaten out, so let's eat something good.

341
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,320
What do you want to eat?

342
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,990
Think it over fast. I told you that I'm starving.

343
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,950
Jjajangmyun.

344
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:02,500
Jjajangmyun?
That's good.

345
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,560
Then, I should eat jjambbong
(spicy seafood noodles)

346
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,470
Let's get going.

347
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:22,560
What? Do you feel like eating this?

348
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,040
I should have ordered jjajangmyun, too.

349
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,600
Here.

350
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,600
Then, you eat this.

351
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,840
No, honey, you eat your jjajangmyun.

352
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:40,610
I, too...honestly, I think
I should've ordered the jjambbong.

353
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,410
Really?

354
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:49,650
It's always like that.

355
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:51,720
When you order jjajangmyun,
you want to eat jjambbong,

356
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,060
but when you order jjambbong,
you want to eat jjajangmyun.

357
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:57,010
It really is like that.

358
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,830
It's really good.

359
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,160
The jjajangmyun is good, too.

360
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:26,480
What is this? Getting it everywhere like a kid...

361
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:28,410
Here.

362
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,880
All done.

363
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:41,810
Today, I met with my brother,

364
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,200
and he said that we should hurry up
and go to the United States.

365
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:47,960
So, I told him that we're going to go next week.
Just thought you might want to know.

366
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,330
Next week?

367
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,200
- Meow!
- Meow!

368
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,410
Oh, cats!

369
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:00,070
- Cats!
- Meow!

370
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,980
Are you guys really going to be like this?

371
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,050
Like what, Auntie?

372
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:14,270
Hey, do I look like a joke to you? Why are you
suddenly separating now that I'm here?

373
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,110
Oh, seriously...!

374
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:21,300
No, why is there yelling again?

375
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:26,840
Unni, they're giving me so much stress, that
I don't think I can live anymore, seriously!

376
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:33,050
Hey, why is she like that again?

377
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:35,600
Well, we weren't doing anything.

378
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,310
We were just holding hands and
watching TV and Auntie came.

379
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,870
So we just separately when she got out.

380
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,870
You guys, why do you have to show off like that?

381
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,770
Mom, then, what do you want us to do?

382
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,770
When we're together, you say something.

383
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:51,800
When we're not, you still say something.
What do you want me to do?

384
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:55,600
Mother, I'm receiving too much stress.

385
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:58,830
Oh really, what am I supposed to do with her!

386
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,250
I've suggested joining a remarriage group,

387
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,110
and she says she'd rather die.

388
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:06,040
Yes, rather than marrying a divorced man or a single dad,

389
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,410
she says she'd rather die an old maid.

390
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:13,890
As she got older,

391
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:15,750
I never imagined she'd also get more troublesome.

392
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,500
Who would've thought?

393
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:24,550
Hey Mom. You should talk to PD Bong about Aunt.

394
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,250
What?

395
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,620
That's right, Mother-in-law.

396
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:30,080
Didn't Aunt say she was interested in him?

397
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:32,980
She told you that?

398
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,700
That she liked PD Bong?

399
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,370
Yes! That's why you should talk to him about it.

400
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,130
There's no harm in it anyway.

401
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,930
Mother-in-law, it's PD Bong!

402
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,800
What? Who?

403
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,110
Hello, hello, how are you?

404
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,920
Omo, the smell of liquor!

405
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:00,530
PD Bong, have you been drinking?

406
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:03,250
Yes, because I'm in such a good mood!

407
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,190
We've wrapped up filming!
So we went for a drink after that.

408
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:07,660
If that's so, shouldn't you have gone home?

409
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,710
What are you doing here?

410
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:16,630
That's true. Why exactly did I
come here?

411
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:17,900
No... I mean...

412
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,700
PD Bong, just now...

413
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,150
Didn't you say you came to discuss the script?

414
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,200
Is that so?

415
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,850
Well, let's continue the conversation in my room.

416
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,310
I don't think I said that...

417
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:28,210
- Come on, hurry, please go in!
- What? Why...

418
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:28,960
We'll talk in my room!

419
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,880
Mom! Mom!

420
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,680
Really, my mom sure can't read a situation...

421
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,280
In this kind of situation,

422
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,330
she should've sent PD Bong into Aunt's room!

423
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:39,880
Really, Mom has no clue at all!

424
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:43,730
No, I don't think that's it.

425
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:45,430
When...

426
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:50,290
Oh really, what's up with you?!

427
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:53,410
The children are in and all, really...

428
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:55,330
Well, you know me...

429
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:59,230
I act based on my self-confidence.

430
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:02,500
I have the confidence to believe in myself.

431
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,770
Is that something to be so proud of?

432
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:08,560
Would anyone call himself a fool?

433
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,810
What I mean is,

434
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:17,370
I'm the kind of person who doesn't
care at all what people think.

435
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:22,680
And so? What about it?

436
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:27,160
You know what I mean,

437
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,080
so please don't do this.

438
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,530
Mr. PD,

439
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,840
even if the actors aren't up to par,

440
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,420
you shouldn't torture the writer like this,
you really can't do this!

441
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:43,470
I'm really concentrating before the computer,
in order to write the scripts!

442
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,500
Why on earth are you doing this!

443
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,670
You're really no help at all!

444
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:52,800
Mother-in-law, here's a refreshing cup of water...

445
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:03,640
Has PD Bong fallen asleep like that?

446
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,420
Mom, what's PD Bong...

447
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,580
What's this?

448
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,360
Chul, isn't it amazing?

449
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,100
I've never seen someone fall asleep sitting up before!

450
00:33:12,610 --> 00:33:14,730
Wow, it's really something.

451
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:16,170
Dear, you know,

452
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:16,740
with this kind of skill,

453
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,450
he could even appear on the Star King programme!

454
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:21,300
That's right! If he were to go, he'd surely win!

455
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,870
How could he sleep like that...

456
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:29,600
We're home!

457
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,100
Oh, Kang Ho,

458
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,960
did your date go well?

459
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,820
Yes.

460
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,000
Seeing you two get along well,

461
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,020
after such a long time,

462
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,840
makes me so happy I could fly!

463
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:48,550
Don't you think so?

464
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:50,360
Yes, Mother.

465
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:53,070
Auntie!

466
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:55,360
Yes, Yoo-bin.

467
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:00,700
Hey, kiddo!

468
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,740
Your auntie is your uncle's wife,

469
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:04,790
you know that?

470
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:09,570
Auntie, please make me chocolate cookies!

471
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:13,460
Oh dear, what to do?

472
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:16,930
If you eat cookies at night,
they'll rot your teeth.

473
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:19,160
I'll make you some tomorrow.

474
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:25,040
Yoo Bin, it's past your bedtime.

475
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,630
Let's go up to bathe and sleep.

476
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:30,560
All right, then after bathing with Auntie,

477
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,470
I want to shoot water guns with her!

478
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:39,230
Oh, look at you...

479
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:41,870
You like your Auntie so much?

480
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:46,070
Next time, Yoo-bin.

481
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,990
Tonight, go with your mother.

482
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:52,260
Let's go.

483
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,710
It's been a long time since we had some wine.

484
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,790
Why are you being so sensitive?

485
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:40,400
You're making things harder on Yoo Bin like this.

486
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:46,520
Just act like before,

487
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:50,020
as if nothing had happened,
wouldn't that be better?

488
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,940
Everyone knows, how can we act as if nothing happened?

489
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,210
We can't do that.

490
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:59,630
It won't be long before Kang Ho
and Sister-in-law move out.

491
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,890
Just bear with it until then.

492
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,980
It seemed just now like she was discouraging Yoo Bin,

493
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,890
so why are you acting like this?

494
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:13,080
I don't know, I guess we'll have to wait and see,

495
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,570
whether she'll leave so easily.

496
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,560
What do you mean by that?

497
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,400
What's wrong?

498
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:48,540
You're not feeling well?

499
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:56,470
I guess I ate lunch too quickly...

500
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,640
How could I not have known then...

501
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:06,820
Why? Why? Why?

502
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,520
How could I not know...

503
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,240
What are you doing?

504
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:18,290
Why are you being like this?

505
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:22,400
Oh God, Honey!

506
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,550
What are you doing this for?

507
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:28,690
You're really killing me!

508
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:32,560
I... Why do I live?

509
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:35,020
A person like me living,

510
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:38,590
can't even protect poor Eun Nim!

511
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,260
I'm so pathetic!

512
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,400
Why do I live, really?

513
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,430
What's wrong with you?

514
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:52,050
If you're really thinking of Eun Nim,

515
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:53,400
being considerate of her,

516
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:54,760
you should take care of yourself,

517
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,630
why are you drinking?

518
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:59,970
The daughter you love so much,

519
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:02,360
sold her body to save you.

520
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,020
How could you die?

521
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,930
You should live healthily for her!

522
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,670
Honey...

523
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:17,460
Only by living healthily,

524
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,990
can you protect Eun Nim!

525
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:21,310
Isn't that right?

526
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:25,860
So don't cry, don't cry...

527
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:35,550
Don't cry, Honey, don't cry...

528
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:51,280
Oh, you should've slept longer...

529
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,020
Aigoo, what's this..

530
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:56,660
I'll be off.

531
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,000
You really have to think of Eun Nim,

532
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,400
don't bother yourself with other thoughts.

533
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:04,700
If anything happens to you,
what would happen to your daughter?

534
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,960
You know very well.

535
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:31,720
Now isn't the time for me to be
scrubbing dishes like this.

536
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:33,390
That's right.

537
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:37,320
Can't let that woman keep ruining our Eun Nim's future.

538
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,870
Oh, really.

539
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:58,120
Hello?

540
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:01,470
It's me. You know who I am, right?

541
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:05,450
Yes. Is anything the matter?

542
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,590
Let's meet.

543
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:09,610
What's the matter?

544
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:12,640
I have nothing more to say to you.

545
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:14,530
But I have something to tell you.

546
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,200
I'm busy now.

547
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,160
I was your mother's friend before you married.

548
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,130
If an elder tells you to come out, you'll do so.

549
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,340
What did you want to tell me?

550
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:34,800
I heard Eun Nim and Kang Ho are going to the US?

551
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:38,090
Just let them go and live well.

552
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,570
Ahjumma.

553
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:42,260
It's something else if you don't know,

554
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:45,020
but since you know, how can you still say this?

555
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,680
That's right.

556
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:48,970
So she's even given birth to a child,

557
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:51,500
and hidden this fact and married someone.

558
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,650
It was undoubtedly wrong of her,

559
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:55,130
and I have nothing to say to that.

560
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:58,470
Even if Kang Ho weren't to accept it,
I'd have nothing to say.

561
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:03,530
But the fact is that he's accepted her.

562
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:06,750
Haven't I told you the identity
of the child sister-in-law gave birth to?

563
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:09,930
I was also forced under impossible circumstances

564
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,850
to tell you.

565
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:13,730
This is something that can't happen.

566
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,700
Why can't it happen?

567
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,530
Aren't you even afraid of god?

568
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,730
Of what punishment awaits you for this?

569
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:22,000
What god does is one thing,

570
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,670
why are you interfering in it?

571
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:26,100
What did you say?

572
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:28,210
What I mean is,

573
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:29,980
you can't do this.

574
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,890
Because you can't give birth,
Eun Nim gave you a child.

575
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:34,780
Shouldn't you be thankful to her?

576
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:37,400
Shouldn't you thank her and be grateful?

577
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,190
If you keep saying things like this,

578
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:42,710
it's you who'll get punished.

579
00:41:45,330 --> 00:41:47,540
Whoever god helps in the end,

580
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:50,190
is not something that one can guess.

581
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,480
Isn't that so?

582
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,130
How incredibly thick-skinned.

583
00:41:56,250 --> 00:42:00,080
I see why sister-in-law is also so thick-skinned.

584
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:01,790
What?

585
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:03,680
I've clearly told you before,

586
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:06,100
that the two would never do.

587
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:09,040
Be it for Yoo Bin,

588
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,250
or for our family,

589
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:14,480
I'll find away to break Kang Ho and Eun Nim apart!

590
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:27,920
Let go!

591
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,870
Please let Eun Nim off!

592
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,340
If you want me to go on my knees,
I'll kneel down and beg.

593
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,950
Why are you being like this?

594
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,750
I'm begging you,

595
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:38,010
if anything happens to Eun Nim,
my husband will die too.

596
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:40,180
Don't they say the wishes of a dying person will come true?

597
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,810
Even if it's for my sake,

598
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:43,820
aren't I your mother's friend?

599
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:46,520
There are things in this world that pass,
and things that will never do.

600
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,000
Even if the sky were to collapse,

601
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,540
Kang Ho and Eun Nim are not to be.

602
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,360
Eun Nim is a pitiful child.

603
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:56,790
Her mother died when she was young,
and so afraid was she that her father would follow,

604
00:42:56,790 --> 00:42:59,310
she did that to save her father!

605
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:01,840
Didn't you also lose your father?
You should know her pain!

606
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:05,550
Please let our Eun Nim off this once.

607
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:17,870
Is she really Chung Ja's daughter?

608
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:23,740
She really doesn't seem like her daughter...

609
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:29,370
Yes?

610
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:33,010
Oh, are you packing your bags?

611
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:34,120
Yes.

612
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:37,880
Just pack simply, only the essentials.

613
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:40,670
I'll ask Driver Kim to send them ahead for you tomorrow.

614
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,040
If there's anything else you need,
you can just buy them there.

615
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,770
That could be fun too!

616
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:48,720
Yes, Grandmother.

617
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:51,750
But then, if you go to America,

618
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:54,250
won't it be uncomfortable not speaking the language?

619
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:57,910
Just learn some simple English here first before you go.

620
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:00,160
There'll be no problem when you're with Kang Ho,

621
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,730
but when Kang Ho goes to work,

622
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:03,570
won't you be bored alone?

623
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:04,740
Yes...

624
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,110
I'm learning little by little, now.

625
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:10,120
Hold on.

626
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,680
I know a really good English teacher.

627
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,120
Do you want me to ask him for a favor?

628
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,590
Oh no!

629
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:18,040
There aren't many days left anyway.

630
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,810
Oh yes, that's true.

631
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:21,040
Anyway over there,

632
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:25,740
there are many places teaching English to foreigners.

633
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:26,690
Since you're young,

634
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:29,460
you'll learn quickly once you get there!

635
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:31,040
Yes.

636
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:39,250
Yes, Dad?

637
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,280
Now?

638
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:51,230
Dad, why are we eating at such an expensive place?

639
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:54,590
For a father treating his daughter,
this much is all right.

640
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:56,550
Come, let's eat.

641
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,390
All right.

642
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:08,220
It's delicious.

643
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,790
Dad, you eat too.

644
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,660
Eat plenty.

645
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:14,500
You liked eating this when you were young,

646
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,630
but I couldn't afford to buy you more then.

647
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,230
If mother

648
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:23,630
and Nan Jung unni and Eun Jung had also
come that would've been nice.

649
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:25,270
Your mother and Nan Jung,

650
00:45:25,270 --> 00:45:27,870
I can always treat them to a meal next time.

651
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:29,930
Go on, eat.

652
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:31,720
Oh Dad,

653
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:34,470
don't be speaking as if we'll never meet again!

654
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:38,660
Kang Ho has agreed that we'll be
coming back often to Korea.

655
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:40,690
And once we're settled in there,

656
00:45:40,690 --> 00:45:42,740
we'll invite you and Mom over too.

657
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:45,650
All right,

658
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:48,460
thanks to my daughter,

659
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:54,020
I'll get to visit the US too.

660
00:45:58,390 --> 00:45:59,440
Dad...

661
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,380
Why are you like this?

662
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:04,570
It's nothing, eat.

663
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:06,840
I'll just be going to the restroom a bit.

664
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:52,800
Yoo Bin! Yoo Bin!

665
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,040
Where's Yoo Bin?

666
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,090
He had a snack and is sleeping.

667
00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:02,940
Would you like some coffee too?

668
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:05,190
I'm already feeling so bothered,

669
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:08,170
I'm not in the mood for coffee!

670
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:12,270
No matter what,

671
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:15,540
I'm starting to feel uneasy towards in-law Park,

672
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,170
and worrying that things might get worse.

673
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,230
I feel uneasy.

674
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:21,440
Looks like it's going to happen.

675
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:25,090
Brother and Sister-in-law's breakup.

676
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:27,830
I guess you're right.

677
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:32,200
In-law Park didn't know anything,

678
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,160
they must really be feeling the blow now.

679
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,810
Mother!

680
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:39,000
What?

681
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,060
Why do you keep thinking such thoughts?

682
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:43,440
Whether it was for you or for me,

683
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,960
did you forget the pains we went through then?

684
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,480
Forget? Who's forgotten?

685
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:50,060
I haven't forgotten a single thing!

686
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:53,050
I'm having such a headache over it!

687
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:06,360
I'm back.

688
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,670
Yes, good.

689
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:11,580
Is your father well?

690
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:13,040
Yes.

691
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,550
Since you're going to the US,

692
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:18,690
I'm sure he can't bear to let you go.

693
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:21,520
Yes, a little.

694
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:24,660
Yes, of course he would.

695
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:27,170
Even if you were to go back and forth often,

696
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,890
how could it be the same as if you were in Seoul?

697
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:31,970
So...

698
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:36,020
what did you and your father talk about?

699
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,090
Nothing much,

700
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:40,810
we just had lunch together
and I came home afterwards.

701
00:48:40,810 --> 00:48:42,940
<i>Ah, I see.</i>

702
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:45,510
<i>So, did you eat something nice?</i>

703
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:47,980
Yes, Grandmother.

704
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:51,410
What is up with this?

705
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:56,260
What on earth is happening?

706
00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:00,670
Didn't Eun Nim eat with her father?

707
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:04,680
Did you explain the situation clearly to the in-law?

708
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,380
Perhaps you were trying to be discreet,

709
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:08,050
and they didn't understand you?

710
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:09,250
No.

711
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:13,580
Then... what's going on?

712
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:17,810
I didn't talk about Yoo Bin with the in-law,

713
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:21,160
just about Sister-in-law's being a surrogate mother.

714
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:24,970
How thick-skinned!

715
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,390
How could he, knowing his daughter
had given birth to a child,

716
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:29,770
still marry her off as if she was a virgin,

717
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:31,480
pretending nothing had ever happened?

718
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:35,260
Even though Eun Nim's mom knows about Yoo Bin,

719
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:38,130
she even tried to put the blame on me.

720
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:40,640
What? Did she really?

721
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:44,410
How could there be someone so inhuman?

722
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:47,230
Becoming in-laws with such people

723
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,020
is so humiliating.

724
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:51,600
I'm back.

725
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,120
Came back with Sae Hun and Kang Ho.

726
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:55,460
Oh, yes.

727
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:56,910
Welcome home.

728
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,900
Then, I'll be on my way out.

729
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:06,260
Why, is something the matter?

730
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:08,510
No.

731
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:14,060
Sister-in-law, let me help.

732
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:18,220
Thank you.

733
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:25,570
Son, you've already told Driver Kim,

734
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:28,190
to send the luggage on ahead tomorrow, haven't you?

735
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:29,130
Yes, I have.

736
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:32,340
But do you have so little luggage?

737
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:36,890
No, it was I who told them to pack just the essentials.

738
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:38,730
Shopping for the rest when they get there,

739
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:39,830
will also be fun for them.

740
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:41,160
Oh, yes.

741
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,080
Those we haven't packed,

742
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,360
we'll just bring when we leave.

743
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,360
Oh, of course.

744
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,600
Honey, you sit too.

745
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:52,090
Here, these are the plane tickets.

746
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,610
Oh, they've arrived so fast?

747
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:57,900
I went to get them today.

748
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,010
Thanks, Hyung.

749
00:51:06,850 --> 00:51:08,160
Aigoo.

750
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,840
Even though I knew you'd be leaving

751
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:14,820
now that I've seen the tickets

752
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:17,660
it does feel rather strange.

753
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:20,930
You've been living abroad since high school

754
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:23,380
spending each year in two parts of the world,

755
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:26,880
now that we've gotten closer
you're leaving again.

756
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:28,560
Then, Grandmother,

757
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:31,040
would you like to come and live with us?

758
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:32,010
What?

759
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:36,640
Don't say things you don't mean!

760
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,710
We'll come back really really often.

761
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:41,050
Of course, of course you must.

762
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:43,950
How much longer will I be able to live?

763
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:48,390
Oh my, Yeon Hee,

764
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:51,350
where have you been?

765
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:53,740
Do you know how worried I've been?

766
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:56,910
But then,

767
00:51:56,910 --> 00:51:59,890
why did you sell the house?

768
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:03,190
Selling it while there's some of the deposit left,

769
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:04,740
isn't that better?

770
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:09,970
Mom, let's return to the countryside.

771
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:11,410
The countryside?

772
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:15,930
I can't live in the country anymore.

773
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:18,710
Is that so?

774
00:52:20,370 --> 00:52:21,620
All right then.

775
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,810
Then you'll have to live alone

776
00:52:23,950 --> 00:52:25,720
because I'm going down to the countryside.

777
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:33,030
If you do strange things again,

778
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:36,770
that will be the end of things between us,

779
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:38,760
please just keep that in mind.

780
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,150
Once I take this I'll have 3 points!

781
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:50,120
Aigoo! It was there!

782
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:56,120
Oh, what's this?

783
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:58,160
That's gone then!

784
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:03,460
Kang Ho finally failed!

785
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:04,880
Then Grandmother,

786
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,240
do you have it?

787
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:09,180
I don't,

788
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:10,590
don't you have it?

789
00:53:10,890 --> 00:53:12,270
It's not me either...

790
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:14,980
It's right here with me!

791
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:15,480
What's this?

792
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:16,870
Aigoo!

793
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:19,700
This one's big...

794
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:21,950
Why aren't you two playing?

795
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:23,410
Quick, turn the cards!

796
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:26,810
Say, girl,

797
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:31,090
I'm so tired, I can't play anymore.

798
00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:32,340
Yes, Grandmother,

799
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:34,370
I'm so tired too.

800
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:35,350
- Isn't that right!
- Yes...

801
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:36,300
So, my girl...

802
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:40,120
- This round doesn't count!
- Hey!

803
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,190
Hey, what's this!

804
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:44,510
How can you do this!

805
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:48,000
<i>Kid, this one, 3 points,</i>

806
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,530
<i>it should me mine.</i>

807
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:53,340
<i>My girl, how can you live with such a husband?</i>

808
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:54,180
<i>Isn't that right!</i>

809
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:55,690
<i>He's making life difficult for me...</i>

810
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:56,370
<i>Isn't he!</i>

811
00:53:56,370 --> 00:53:57,100
<i>Yes!</i>

812
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,380
<i>We can't play this anymore!</i>

813
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:00,140
<i>Yes, Grandmother.</i>

814
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:02,770
<i>I won 3000 won!</i>

815
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,810
What are you doing today?

816
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:42,970
I'll pack up the rest of the luggage,

817
00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:45,340
and go over to grandmother's place...

818
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:46,440
I don't know.

819
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:48,690
There's not many days left,
I'm getting anxious,

820
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:50,810
but I'm worried we'll leave something behind.

821
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:52,750
It's fine as long as you don't forget me.

822
00:54:53,410 --> 00:54:55,380
Don't work yourself too hard.

823
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:07,400
A kiss!

824
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:17,690
I'll be off.

825
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:43,230
This is your last chance.

826
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:50,630
Sister-in-law, please, won't you leave?

827
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:52,420
Go somewhere where no one knows you,

828
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,660
you'll be saving my life.

829
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,560
Of course,

830
00:55:57,930 --> 00:56:00,400
you'll miss your husband for a while,

831
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:03,270
it'll be hard on you for awhile.

832
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:05,830
But all that,

833
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:08,070
will go away with time

834
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:11,360
and everything will return to normal.

835
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:13,760
So, Sister-in-law...

836
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:19,550
I'm sorry.

837
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,470
I can't do that anymore.

838
00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:25,650
Sister-in-law!

839
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:28,090
You're creating more difficulties for our family!

840
00:56:28,090 --> 00:56:29,730
Why don't you know this!

841
00:56:29,870 --> 00:56:31,140
Sister-in-law,

842
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,320
after I leave, I'll live quietly.

843
00:56:35,530 --> 00:56:38,540
If you so wish it,
I won't return to Korea.

844
00:56:39,350 --> 00:56:40,940
So, Sister-in-law,

845
00:56:41,390 --> 00:56:43,370
please help me.

846
00:56:43,370 --> 00:56:44,380
Are you really,

847
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:46,460
going to persist in doing this?

848
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:48,070
If it's about Yoo Bin,

849
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:51,500
Sister-in-law, you really have nothing to worry about.

850
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:54,390
You're Yoo Bin's mother.

851
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:57,240
I will always be Yoo Bin's auntie.

852
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:07,880
I've tried my best to the end,

853
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:11,250
to resolve this amicably,

854
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:13,840
but I guess,

855
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:16,560
that won't be possible.

856
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:19,480
In the future,

857
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:22,180
whatever end arises,

858
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:25,630
don't forget that it was all your fault.

859
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,100
Sister-in-law!

860
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,940
What are you planning to do?

861
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:32,730
Who knows?

862
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:38,300
Why would I be telling you, in any case?

863
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,490
You're leaving for work?

864
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:57,140
Yes.

865
00:57:57,490 --> 00:58:01,770
Honey, don't worry too much.

866
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:03,930
Everything will be fine.

867
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:22,310
Aigoo, really.

868
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:29,050
This old man's forgotten his mobile phone again.

869
00:58:29,810 --> 00:58:32,930
When will he stop forgetting things?

870
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,600
What are you doing here?

871
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:54,350
Mr. in-law, I've made things so clear,

872
00:58:54,830 --> 00:58:57,390
how can you still let Sister-in-law go?

873
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,730
I'm sorry.

874
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:01,560
That matter...

875
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,320
doesn't seem to bother my son-in-law,

876
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:09,100
we shouldn't be impeding their future, should we?

877
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:13,660
I hadn't wanted to tell you this.

878
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,770
Our Yoo Bin...

879
00:59:17,690 --> 00:59:19,590
Sister-in-law gave birth to him.

880
00:59:19,850 --> 00:59:20,870
What?

881
00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:23,860
What do you mean?

882
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:26,210
The child sister-in-law was a surrogate mother to,

883
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:28,000
is our Yoo Bin!

884
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:30,320
Sir,

885
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:33,470
so please stop sister-in-law.

886
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:37,150
The fortunes of an entire family
are tied to those of a single person.

887
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:44,950
Please, I'm begging you.

888
00:59:52,530 --> 00:59:55,740
What, what's that girl doing here again?

889
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,430
Oh, really!

890
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:03,170
Honey, what was that girl saying?

891
01:00:04,030 --> 01:00:05,420
Perhaps...

892
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,210
you were already in the know?

893
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:10,930
No, Honey,

894
01:00:10,930 --> 01:00:12,230
what did that woman say?

895
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:13,520
Don't listen to her, she's wrong!

896
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,540
Why didn't you tell me?

897
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:17,970
Yoo Bin...

898
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:21,720
Yoo Bin is that child of Eun Nim's?

899
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:24,080
That child?

900
01:00:25,110 --> 01:00:26,640
Honey...

901
01:00:29,370 --> 01:00:33,430
Honey! Honey! What's wrong!

902
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:36,100
Honey!

903
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:41,630
Honey what's wrong, wake up!

904
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:43,570
Honey!

911
01:01:06,510 --> 01:01:08,940
<i>Have you told the in-law about Yoo Bin?</i>

912
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:11,100
<i>It seems like acute liver cancer...</i>

913
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:12,970
<i>What punishment are you seeking?</i>

914
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:14,710
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

915
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:17,030
<i>I'm afraid Yoo Bin will be taken away!</i>

916
01:01:17,030 --> 01:01:19,850
<i>Afraid he'll abandon me for his real mother!</i>

917
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:21,910
<i>That's why I did what I did!</i>

918
01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:23,950
<i>The one who made father-in-law collapse,</i>

919
01:01:23,950 --> 01:01:25,390
<i>was it you, sister-in-law?</i>

920
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:29,200
<i>Were you planning to hide this truth to the end?</i>

921
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,760
<i>It seems tonight will be the last night.</i>

922
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,070
<i>If anything happens to my father,</i>

923
01:01:32,070 --> 01:01:33,490
<i>I won't forgive you.</i>

924
01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:35,100
The lengths to which I went to save him!

925
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:36,790
I was only telling the truth!

926
01:01:36,790 --> 01:01:38,020
What truth?

927
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:40,430
The truth that I gave birth to Yoo Bin.
