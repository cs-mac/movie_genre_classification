1
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,700
What is going on in here?

2
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,300
What is this mess?

3
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,700
Didn't you all promise me
you were gonna be quiet?

4
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,700
Melissa, put your phone away.
Put it away right now!

5
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,400
What is this doing out?

6
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,100
I asked you to be quiet.

7
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,500
And look at you.

8
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,500
Jacob, what is that?

9
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,300
It's the sky, Mr. Plummer.

10
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,600
A green sky with yellow stars?

11
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,300
It's Camp Jupiter's sky.

12
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,600
Now, watch out, Jacob.

13
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:06,100
Van Gogh ended up
cutting off his own ear.

14
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,600
Quiet. I said quiet, everybody!

15
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,800
Jake! Over here.

16
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,400
Oh!

17
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,900
Hey, hey, hey. Look at you.

18
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,500
What happened?

19
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,000
Your parents are going to be
coming home very late tonight.

20
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,000
Come on, let's go.

21
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,700
We'll pass by Papaya King
on the way home.

22
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,800
Yes.

23
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,300
Jardine residence, good evening.

24
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,000
<i>Good evening.
And who am I talking to?</i>

25
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,300
- Who is this?
- <i>This is Sal Bartolini.</i>

26
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,500
<i>I'm an old friend
of Max Jardine's.</i>

27
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,000
<i>- Is this Jacob?</i>
- Yes.

28
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,200
<i>Oh, Jacob,
the last time I saw you,</i>

29
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,600
<i>you were a little baby.
I guess you're all grown up now.</i>

30
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,400
Mm.

31
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,200
<i>Is your dad at home?
Or your mom?</i>

32
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,000
No, they're not home yet.

33
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,500
<i>Look, I'm sorry to hear
about your grandfather, Jacob.</i>

34
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,900
<i>Max and I knew each other
for so long.</i>

35
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,700
<i>We met when we were about your age.
You must be what, like, ten now?</i>

36
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,100
Thirteen.

37
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,200
<i>He was such a dear old friend
of mine, your granddaddy was.</i>

38
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,900
<i>Do you know
when the service is gonna be?</i>

39
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,300
What service?

40
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,700
<i>Well, the funeral.</i>

41
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,500
<i>I imagine there's going
to be a service soon.</i>

42
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,000
- Hold on a second.
- Who is it?

43
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,600
I don't know.

44
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,000
Can I help you?

45
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,200
Is that woman
waiting for us?

46
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,700
No, she rents
the store downstairs.

47
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,500
Antonio!

48
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Are you and Dad serious
about us moving here?

49
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,200
Jake,
let's talk about it later.

50
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,600
I really don't wanna move
to Brooklyn.

51
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,100
Hi, Mrs. Calvelli, Brian Jardine.

52
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,600
- We've met.
- Of course.

53
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm so sad for what has happened.

54
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,600
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,400
Thank you.

56
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,900
I'm so sorry.

57
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,900
Your father
was a such a wonderful man.

58
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,700
- He really was, you know.
- I know.

59
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,800
What do you want?

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
- This is my son, Antonio.
- Hi.

61
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,800
And I don't think
you've met my wife, Kathy.

62
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,500
- Hi.
- Hello.

63
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,000
- Nice to meet you. Leonor.
- I'm sorry, my hands are full.

64
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,400
Yeah, we're just having
a little reception upstairs,

65
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,300
- for some friends and family.
- Of course.

66
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,100
You know,
I grew up in this house.

67
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,100
When I was a kid, there was
a produce store down here.

68
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,600
I know, your father told me.

69
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,900
- Let me help you with that.
- Oh, thanks.

70
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,200
Ella the Harpy?

71
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,000
She's a nerd, but I
got a thing for redheads. Don't you?

72
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,900
Uh, I don't know.

73
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,000
- I'll take it.
- Oh, thanks.

74
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,000
- Tyson's such a douchebag.
- Oh, not in the end, he's not.

75
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,000
I just finished <i>The Blood of Olympus.</i>

76
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,600
I got the game. Wanna play?

77
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,900
- Now?
- Yeah.

78
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,000
I'd like to, but I can't.
It's my grandfather's funeral.

79
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,500
Yeah, I know.

80
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,900
I never know what to say
in these situations.

81
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,600
I think you're supposed to say,
"I'm sorry for your loss."

82
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,700
That's it.

83
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,500
- Here, could you carry this?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

84
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,800
- Sorry for your loss.
- Oh, that's okay.

85
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,000
Did you draw this?

86
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,500
Yeah, it's the sky
above Camp Jupiter,

87
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,200
- the day of the battle.
- You're a real artist.

88
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:25,700
Not really.

89
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,700
Yeah, you are. This is awesome.

90
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
- You got it, son?
- Yeah, I got it.

91
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,300
You know, you're gonna like
this neighborhood.

92
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,600
- It's become a very bohemian area.
- It's just a reception.

93
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I know, but if you
move in, I can show you around.

94
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,200
My mom and I just live
a few blocks away.

95
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,200
I'm not sure we're moving in.

96
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,300
- Hi.
- Hello.

97
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,100
It's a dessert we make in my country
for special occasions.

98
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,600
I hope you like it.

99
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,600
Oh, my God,
you didn't have to.

100
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,100
Max loved this cake,
so I thought...

101
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,700
Come in, please.
You should come in.

102
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,100
- It's okay.
- No, please, I insist.

103
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,200
I just wanted to bring the cake.

104
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,400
I still have some paperwork
to do downstairs before I go home.

105
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,800
Thank you for this.

106
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,900
Very kind of you. Thank you.

107
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,200
Excuse us, but we're leaving.

108
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,300
Oh, okay. Thank you,
thank you so much.

109
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,500
Thank you, thank you for coming.

110
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,300
Thanks for coming.
Thank you, thank you.

111
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,000
- Okay. Bye.
- I'm so sorry.

112
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,300
Oh, thank you so much.

113
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,300
- Great to see you, thank you.
- It was lovely.

114
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,700
Thank you, thank you.

115
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,100
I don't remember this.

116
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:05,600
Oh, my God.

117
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,700
Her plate.

118
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,800
Leonor.

119
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,400
Hi, Kathy.

120
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,700
The boys are in my office
in the back.

121
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,700
No, look what I just found.

122
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,100
My plate.

123
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,800
I think that night we
just ended up taking everything

124
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,300
back to our old apartment.

125
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,900
And we packed things away
and I forgot.

126
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,600
I'm so sorry.

127
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,600
No worries, please.

128
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,600
It's a beautiful plate.

129
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,600
Are you not working today?

130
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,200
I don't see patients on Monday.

131
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,200
I need a day a week...

132
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,200
- to organize my life, you know?
- Good for you.

133
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,400
The store looks cute.

134
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,400
We are not doing so well.

135
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:19,000
I like that dress, the green paisley.

136
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,700
Oh, I love that one.

137
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:26,100
- You should try that on.
- Oh, I have a lot to unpack.

138
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,500
Come on, it'll take you a minute.

139
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,700
- Perfection.
- Are you sure? I don't know.

140
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,800
It looks great.

141
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,000
Let me tie this.

142
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,800
- The dress is beautiful.
- How much is it?

143
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,500
Whatever the price is,
I'll give you ten percent discount.

144
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,700
Let me see. Oh, no, up here.

145
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,200
- Okay.
- Did you make this?

146
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,000
No, not this one.

147
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,800
But everything here is
handmade designers.

148
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,700
This is 250, and it's made
by a woman named Talita.

149
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,600
She's Colombian, very talented.

150
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,900
Guys, what do you think?

151
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,400
Jake?

152
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,000
Jake, what's our deal?

153
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,200
- Mom, I'm on vacation.
- So?

154
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,900
Dad said it was okay.

155
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,800
We have this rule in the house,
no games during the week,

156
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,800
and no internet before five either.

157
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,500
But when they're on vacation,
they have all this free time.

158
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,800
- What are you going to do?
- Shh, quiet!

159
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,100
Watch your tone, please.

160
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,500
Mrs. Jardine, we're almost done
with this level.

161
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,300
Can we have
a few more moments, please?

162
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,800
That's better.

163
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,000
Sure,
you can finish this level.

164
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,700
But first you gotta tell me,
what do you think?

165
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,000
The dress.

166
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,000
Great. I actually
thought it was yours.

167
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,100
- Jake?
- Love it. Love the feathers.

168
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,300
What are you writing?

169
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,700
Nothing much,
only an idea that occurred to me.

170
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,000
An idea for a short story.

171
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,400
A young girl grows up on
the shores of a lake, as you have.

172
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,400
She loves the lake as the gulls do,

173
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,800
and she is as happy and as free
as they are.

174
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,500
And then here
you can counter.

175
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,000
But a man sees her...

176
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,000
who happens to come her way,

177
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
and he destroys her out of idleness,

178
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,700
as this gull here has been destroyed.

179
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,100
Okay, good, what are
you saying to her right now?

180
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,400
That's lovely, I love that.

181
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,400
But what are you saying to her,
do you think?

182
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,600
Where is it?

183
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,900
Why don't you come and
help me prepare dinner tonight?

184
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,400
Where's Mom?

185
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,500
Your mother had
an emergency with a patient.

186
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,400
She's not gonna be home 'til tonight.

187
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,300
- Another suicide?
- Jake!

188
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,900
Dad, I can't find my drawings.

189
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,200
What drawings? Help me cut these.

190
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,100
The series I made on Percy Jackson.

191
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,000
<i>- The Sea of Monsters.</i>
- Those old drawings?

192
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,300
Yes.

193
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,800
Did you look in the trunk?

194
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,700
Yes, Dad, I looked.
They're not there.

195
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:34,700
Well, I don't know, Jake,
maybe they got thrown away.

196
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,700
Why would you do that?
They're my drawings!

197
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,500
Why don't you just make new ones?

198
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,400
'Cause new ones are never
gonna be like the old ones.

199
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,400
Jake, we moved.

200
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,800
We got rid of furniture.

201
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,900
We threw away clothes,
gave away books.

202
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,500
- We got a new apartment.
- So?

203
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,900
Hey, let me tell you something.
It's good to get rid of stuff.

204
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,500
It's a little hard at first,
but then it feels really good.

205
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,700
Just gotta learn to let go.

206
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,600
I play Trigorin,

207
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,100
a celebrated writer
and the boyfriend of a...

208
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,900
famous actress...

209
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,000
Arkadina.

210
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,100
There's also Nina,
who is the neighbor's daughter,

211
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,200
and she wants to be an actress.

212
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,800
And at first we think
she's in love with Konstantin.

213
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,600
She ends up having an affair
with my character, Trigorin.

214
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,300
Sounds complicated.

215
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,500
Mm. Well, it's complex.

216
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,500
But it's also unexpected.
It has a lot of humor in it, too.

217
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What part?

218
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,000
Good. You're already eating.

219
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,600
- Hi, Mom.
- How was it?

220
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,700
Fine. She's doing good.

221
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,400
The problem now is her husband.

222
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,400
The last thing I want to do
right now is talk about work.

223
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,300
I was telling Jake
about the new play.

224
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,900
I'm starving.

225
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,600
I thought you weren't working
with the train anymore.

226
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,900
I thought you were gonna do
Broadway now.

227
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,300
It's not that simple.

228
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,600
You said you weren't doing
this non-profit stuff.

229
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
That the strategy was
to reach a wider audience.

230
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,400
Things have changed.

231
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,800
You should applaud your father
for being adaptable.

232
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,400
It's what life's all about.

233
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,200
- Hey, Tony! We need one more!
- I can't.

234
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,300
- Why can't you?
- I gotta get home.

235
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,300
Watch out, Katy Perry!

236
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,400
Twelve minutes and 23 seconds!

237
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,200
From Jake's house to here
in 12 minutes and 23 seconds.

238
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,800
Good afternoon, Mrs. Calvelli.

239
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,500
Hi, Jake.

240
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,500
You haven't said hello, Mister.

241
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,600
- Hello, Hernán.
<i>- Hola.</i>

242
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,700
That's my friend Jacob Jardine,
but we call him Jake.

243
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,500
- Hello there, Jake.
- Hi.

244
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,900
- Jake, Hernán.
- So you're the grandson?

245
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,000
Yes, Max was his grandfather,

246
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,200
and his father is Brian Jardine.

247
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,400
The one I was telling you about.

248
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,500
Yeah, he's an actor.
And my mom's a psychotherapist.

249
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,000
Huh. So how are you enjoying
Brooklyn so far?

250
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,800
I like it a lot. Yeah, it's...

251
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,400
It's a lot more peaceful
than Manhattan,

252
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,300
and we have much more space.
It's great.

253
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,400
So are you going to be an actor?
Like your father?

254
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,700
I don't know.

255
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,300
Hernán: Well,
you look like an artist.

256
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,800
The long hair, everything.

257
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,400
Maybe.

258
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,400
He'll tell us more later,
right, Jake? Go ahead.

259
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,500
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

260
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,700
So, that's the son.

261
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,500
Hey, your dad any good at acting?

262
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,000
I don't know. Maybe.

263
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,300
I thought if he was, he maybe
could gimme a couple pointers,

264
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,300
'cause I wanna be an actor
when I grow up.

265
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,100
Oh, sure, yeah, I guess.

266
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,900
He's not that successful or anything.

267
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,700
My dream is to go to LaGuardia
High School for Performing Arts.

268
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,100
You heard of that school?

269
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,500
Well, you know,
Nicki Minaj went there...

270
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,400
Al Pacino, but he flunked out, so...

271
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,700
Yeah, I think my dad applied there.

272
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,800
Oh, really?
Well, it's my dream school.

273
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,800
I've been looking around
for some theater classes,

274
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,600
you know, been practicing on my own.

275
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,800
Gonna audition next year
for the ninth grade.

276
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,300
It's gonna be a lot of work
and a lot of practice.

277
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,000
I might need a partner, okay?

278
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,900
- But I'm not an actor.
- That's okay, can you read?

279
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,500
These are some of the scripts
I'm working on.

280
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,800
Like <i>Ah, Wilderness!</i> and <i>Pariah</i>
by August Strindberg.

281
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,600
It's perfect for us to work on,
'cause it's just two guys.

282
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,800
You know what?
Focus on your art more,

283
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,600
maybe we could both go
to LaGuardia together.

284
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,000
Wouldn't that be great?

285
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,700
- I guess I can try.
- That's the spirit.

286
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,300
- Is Hernán your mom's boyfriend?
- That's disgusting, no!

287
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,900
He's a friend from Chile.

288
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:44,500
My parents are married.
They just don't live together.

289
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,700
- I don't understand.
- Me neither.

290
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,100
My dad travels a lot.
He's a nurse who works for the UN.

291
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,500
Where is he now?

292
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,600
He's in Angola, it's in Africa.

293
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,600
Look what he sent me.

294
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,900
Do you miss
having him around more?

295
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:08,000
I used to. But it's been a while now,
so I've gotten used to it.

296
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,900
Yeah, sometimes my dad goes away
if he's shooting a movie.

297
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,900
But it hasn't really happened
in a while.

298
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,300
Found it.

299
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,500
My dad said
he's gonna take me on safari,

300
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,100
and these are the animals
we're gonna see.

301
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,200
That's really cool.

302
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,500
Do you wish
they still lived together?

303
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,900
I used to. When my dad comes,
he'll cook <i>porchetta.</i>

304
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,600
It's like a roast pork butt.

305
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,900
That's...

306
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,800
- It's good.
- That's disgusting.

307
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,500
It's good. We sit at the table,
you know, just the three of us,

308
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,200
and my dad will tell us
about people he met,

309
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,100
places he's been,
and stories about Africa.

310
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,700
We seem like a normal family,
and then...

311
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,200
Boom.

312
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,000
They start fighting about
something stupid, like always.

313
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,900
And...

314
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,100
I realize it's better
when he's not around.

315
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,300
Imagine if your mom
went with you on the safari,

316
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
and they ended up
falling in love again.

317
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,500
There's a very little chance
of that happening.

318
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,100
But just imagine.
You get an envelope one day.

319
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:17,100
You open it, and it's
two tickets to a safari.

320
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,200
One for you
and one for your mom.

321
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:24,100
And she decides to go because
she feels like she needs a vacation.

322
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,600
So when you get to Africa,
your dad picks you up at the airport,

323
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,600
and takes you
to this incredible place,

324
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,400
like... Like this picture here.

325
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:39,100
You see lions
and elephants, giraffes.

326
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,600
And then it's the end of a beautiful
day in the African savannah.

327
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,700
Your dad wants to take you up
this big hill to see the sunset,

328
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,900
but you're too tired,

329
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,900
so you just say you're gonna
rest in your hotel room.

330
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,900
So they go, the two of them alone.

331
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:03,700
And when they get to the top,
the colors of the sky is like...

332
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,300
Like nothing
they've ever seen before.

333
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,700
A green sky with yellow stars.

334
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,200
Mami! Can I stay for dinner
tonight with the Jardines?

335
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,100
- Leonor: Hmm?
- Mami!

336
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,200
Can I stay for dinner tonight
with the Jardines?

337
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,300
- They're having hamburgers.
- And hot dogs.

338
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,500
Antonio, we have dinner at home,
and I can't come pick you up later.

339
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,700
And I don't like you
walking home alone at night.

340
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,400
Well, he could sleep over.

341
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,200
Have you spoken
to your father about this?

342
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,600
- He won't mind.
- Sure?

343
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,500
- Dad?
- Jake, yes.

344
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,500
- Can Tony sleep over tonight?
- Uh...

345
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,200
Hello, Leonor.

346
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,200
Leonor: Hi.

347
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,200
- You've met my sister Audrey?
- Oh, yes, of course.

348
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,400
Hi, Leonor, long time no see.

349
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,200
Jake is asking
if Tony can stay for dinner.

350
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,800
And a sleep-over.

351
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,100
Yeah, because after dinner,
it's gonna be too late

352
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,800
for him to walk home alone.

353
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,300
Tony, you wanna have hot dogs
and hamburgers with us tonight?

354
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,100
- Yes!
- That is a done deal.

355
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,300
Yes!

356
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,300
I just wanted to make sure with you.

357
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,800
No, no, no, please,

358
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,500
I can't tell you how happy I am
that Jake has a new friend.

359
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,300
You know, it's not easy with him
and other boys, and...

360
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,400
Great that the two of 'em
get along so well.

361
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,900
- Yeah.
- You have a great kid there,

362
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,300
but I guess you know that.

363
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,900
Thanks.

364
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,000
Leonor, do you want some wine?

365
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,100
You know, Brian and I wanted
to have a talk with you

366
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,500
about some things anyway,
so maybe now's a good time?

367
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,300
Oh, thank you, but...

368
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:30,200
I have to go back and finish
some stuff at the office.

369
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,300
Well, we just wanted a minute
of your time, if that's okay.

370
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,500
Right, Brian?

371
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,900
Leonor: I have to go back,
but thanks.

372
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,900
You know, Leonor,
ever since my father died...

373
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,800
just so much has happened.

374
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,300
You and I haven't really had
a chance to talk about the store

375
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:49,400
and all that stuff, and

376
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:52,200
maybe we could just
have a chat this week?

377
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,500
Oh, I'm sorry, but this week
is not good for me.

378
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,000
- I'm doing inventory, so...
- Next week?

379
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:04,500
- Could be.
- Thursday I have rehearsal.

380
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,200
We're gonna get
out of rehearsal early.

381
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,800
I could come by early evening?

382
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,200
- Sure.
- Great.

383
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,600
Come on, guys, burgers'll get cold.

384
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,200
The truth is that
the neighborhood is changing

385
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,400
and that's a very
old-fashioned store.

386
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,000
She did complain to me
that business is not so good.

387
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,500
Well, of course she's gonna say that.
The contract's up.

388
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,600
My guy told me that a similar space

389
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,200
like that in this area could get...

390
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,900
- Five thousand.
- That's crazy.

391
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,400
Cheese, mustard and ketchup, please.

392
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,100
Guests first. Tony, what do you want?

393
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,600
I'll have avocados, tomatoes,
onions, cheese and ketchup.

394
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,300
Yeah, that's on the low end.

395
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,200
- What's the number now?
- Eleven hundred.

396
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,300
For eight years? Never an increase?

397
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,300
Maybe we can talk about this
a little later.

398
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:03,100
Tony, did I hear
your father lives in Africa?

399
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:08,000
Yeah, in Angola. It's a small
Portuguese colony in Africa.

400
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,800
I wrote a paper on it last year.

401
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,200
I got a B+, which was
actually pretty good because

402
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,900
I only spent, like, an hour on it.

403
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,300
My teachers, they're whack, you know.

404
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,800
They'll give you a good grade
on something and you don't try,

405
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
but when you really work hard
and put your best effort into it,

406
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,200
they'll give you a bad grade.

407
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,700
Can you pass the ketchup?
I always like a lot of ketchup.

408
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,200
Thanks.

409
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,700
Jump up! Jump up! Use your voice!

410
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,400
You're a tree in the forest.

411
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,100
And it's snowing!

412
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,400
You're the worst dancer in the world,
and you think you're wonderful! Go!

413
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,800
Yeah!

414
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,400
Give it sounds! Give it sounds!

415
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,000
I'm going to introduce you
to a new relaxation exercise.

416
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,100
I'd like all the chairs
facing this way.

417
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,400
And with plenty... No, this way!

418
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,900
Stop yelling, okay? Really...

419
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,800
Keep your throat relaxed!

420
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,100
The genesis of acting is seeing.

421
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,300
Observation.

422
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:50,700
Understanding
what makes behavior, yes?

423
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,000
So when we do
the repetition exercise,

424
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:59,400
that person does it to us.
We simply react, yes?

425
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,400
So...

426
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,100
Start the exercise, take your time.

427
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,300
You're wearing a pretty shirt.

428
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,200
- I'm wearing a pretty shirt.
- You're wearing a pretty shirt.

429
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,500
- Do you like my shirt?
- No, no.

430
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,500
No questions! Observations.

431
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,100
- You seem mad.
- I seem mad.

432
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,800
- You seem mad.
- I seem mad.

433
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,600
- You seem mad.
- You seem mad.

434
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,100
- I like your hair.
- I like my hair.

435
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,900
- I like your hair.
- I like my hair.

436
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,800
How long have you been doing
this exercise?

437
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,200
How long you been doing
this exercise?

438
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,300
How long have you
been doing this exercise?

439
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,900
How long have you
been doing this exercise?

440
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,600
- I'm not playing with you!
- I'm not playing with you!

441
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
You know, you make me make
mistakes in my own exercise!

442
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,000
You know, you make me make
mistakes in my own exercise!

443
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,800
You make me make mistakes
in my own exercise!

444
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,400
You make me make mistakes
in my own exercise!

445
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,000
- I make you make mistakes!
- I make you make mistakes!

446
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,300
- I make you make mistakes!
- I make you make mistakes!

447
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,100
I make this exercise
the way I like it!

448
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,400
I make the exercise
the way I like it!

449
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,900
I make the exercise
the way I like it!

450
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,200
I make the exercise
the way I like it!

451
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,000
- I like the exercise!
- I like the exercise!

452
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,800
- I love the exercise!
- I love this exercise!

453
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,300
- I love this exercise!
- I love this exercise!

454
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,900
- I love this exercise!
- I love this exercise!

455
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,300
I don't wanna do any other exercise!

456
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,500
I don't wanna do any other exercise!

457
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,100
- I don't wanna do another exercise!
- I don't wanna do another exercise!

458
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:12,000
- I never wanna do another exercise!
- I never wanna do another exercise!

459
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,000
- You have a terrible attitude!
- You've got a terrible attitude!

460
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,700
- You have a terrible attitude!
- You have a terrible attitude!

461
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,000
Your attitude
is more horrible than mine!

462
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,700
Your attitude
is more horrible than mine!

463
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,100
You're a master
of horrible attitudes!

464
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:27,400
- You're a master of master horrible!
- You've got the Swiss cheese

465
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,300
up inside your skull
instead of a brain!

466
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,000
I got Swiss cheese inside of
my skull instead of a brain!

467
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,100
I don't know how you get
anything done all day long!

468
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,800
I don't know how I get
anything done all day long!

469
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,900
I don't know how you
get anything done all day long!

470
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,200
I don't know how you
get all the day done.

471
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:40,300
I don't know
what you're talking about.

472
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,600
I don't know
what you're talking about.

473
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,900
You never know what you're
talking about.

474
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,100
I never know
what I'm talking about.

475
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,300
You never know what you're
talking about.

476
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,700
I never know
what I'm talking about.

477
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,800
You're gonna make me ask another
question, aren't you?

478
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,200
I'm gonna make you
ask another question.

479
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,400
- There you are, you did it again!
- I did it again!

480
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,600
- I did it again!
- I did it again!

481
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,300
- I did it again!
- I did it again!

482
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,500
- You did it again!
- You did it!

483
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,900
- You did it again!
- You!

484
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,700
- You! You! You!
- You! You! You!

485
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,100
- You did it!
- You did it!

486
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,200
- You did it!
- I didn't do it!

487
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,300
- Get outta my face!
- Get outta my face!

488
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,200
- Get outta my face!
- Get out of my face!

489
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,900
Get out of my face!

490
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,200
Oh! Something in my eye...

491
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,600
See, it's right there. Look!

492
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,500
There!

493
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,600
Please, put him in a closet.

494
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,200
Trust fall. Fall.

495
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,800
- First, you have to kill him.
- Fall into me. Fall into me.

496
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,600
- Miles was like, "How are you?"
- Yeah.

497
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,200
Oh my God, yes.
Miles started it.

498
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,400
- Miles...
- No. 'Cause she said hi to him once,

499
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,200
so he said "hi" back,
and she got into the conversation...

500
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,400
Exactly.

501
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,400
And then she re-used my words
against me. And then...

502
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,100
She put words into my mouth.
She was saying...

503
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,600
Oh, my God.
And I wanted to change it, but...

504
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,400
Let's go!

505
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,400
- Right here!
- Go, go, go!

506
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,600
Donny!

507
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,800
- Keep going!
- Back!

508
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,800
- Good save.
- Nice one, Tony!

509
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,800
Hey, Umar, we should try
that thing that the Brazilian does.

510
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,000
So you look like you're gonna
pass it to one player,

511
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:49,500
but you actually pass it
to the other side.

512
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,800
That actually might be a good
idea, if you came to practice.

513
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
What are you talking about?

514
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,700
Dude, you didn't even show up
last Saturday.

515
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,600
Because Tony has a new boyfriend now.

516
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,000
Ask your sister if she thinks
I'm the type

517
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,700
to have a boyfriend. She'll know.

518
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,300
- My cousin Allen goes to 342.
- So what?

519
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,000
- That's his school, isn't it?
- What are you talking about?

520
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,700
Little Jake.
My cousin goes to his school.

521
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,300
- They say he's a weirdo.
- Shut up, Joey!

522
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,200
They say he draws dresses
for the girls during recess.

523
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,700
- Give that back!
- There you are, go ahead.

524
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,700
Eat it!

525
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,200
<i>Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!</i>

526
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,100
<i>"...and the stars never rise,</i>

527
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,300
<i>but I feel the bright eyes
of the beautiful Annabel Lee.</i>

528
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:44,700
<i>And so, all the night-tide,
I lie down by the side</i>

529
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,900
<i>of my darling, my darling</i>

530
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,200
<i>my life and my bride."</i>

531
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,200
What's he saying there?

532
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,300
What's he talking about
when he says that?

533
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:58,400
I think that his love, kind of
like what they were saying,

534
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,300
he's imagining her
in his mind and his heart

535
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,400
because he loves her that much,
like, he's able to...

536
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:10,600
like, create a version of her
in his heart because...

537
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,500
it could even be literal.

538
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,100
I mean, he may actually,
several times a week,

539
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,100
go down and spend the day
lying next to her in her grave.

540
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,600
So what I want you to do
for your assignment is

541
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,300
try to write a poem.

542
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:31,600
Not try, but do it. Write a poem
about someone you love.

543
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,900
Okay? It'll be fun.
Or at least, make it fun.

544
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,900
That's your assignment.

545
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,100
- Hi.
- Hi.

546
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,600
- Hi, Leonor.
- Hi, Jake.

547
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,500
Where are you going?

548
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:53,100
- Is Tony in the office?
- He is, and he's staying there.

549
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,800
He's helping me out today.

550
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,600
But we're supposed
to meet some friends.

551
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,800
Are those the same friends
that beat him up?

552
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,300
- What?
- That's right.

553
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,600
They beat him up.

554
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,800
And you should ask him why.

555
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,600
What's up?

556
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,500
- What happened?
- Nothing.

557
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,400
- I bumped into Joey at soccer.
- But your mom said that...

558
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,400
She's so dramatic.
She deserves an Academy Award.

559
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,700
She doesn't want me
to go out with you

560
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,500
'cause she wants me
to help her with this. Look.

561
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,100
She's not good with numbers,
you know?

562
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,900
Go ahead,
I'll meet up with you later.

563
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,500
Okay.

564
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,200
I'm so sorry, Leonor.
Our rehearsal went late.

565
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,300
- Is this still a good time?
- Yeah.

566
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:19,100
I sent the girl home early
so we could talk.

567
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,600
You wanna go in?

568
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,100
- I'm just going to finish this.
- Okay.

569
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,900
- The store looks nice.
- Thanks.

570
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,800
Brian, why don't you sit down?

571
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,900
My...

572
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,800
sister and I were working
on a transfer of ownership.

573
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,600
It's...

574
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,700
It's almost done.

575
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:13,800
My father left everything in order,
the taxes and all of that.

576
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:17,600
The only thing still pending
is the store, which needs a lease.

577
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,800
You know, your father never
thought much about contracts.

578
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,700
And he was very happy
to have me here.

579
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,600
Max thought my store gave
glamour to the neighborhood,

580
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
and he was proud to be associated.

581
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,900
Well, the neighborhood's changing.

582
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,300
I'm sure you've noticed
the rents have gone up a lot

583
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,000
in the last couple of years.

584
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,800
Yeah, I noticed, and so did Max.

585
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,900
But it was his desire
that I stay here.

586
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,300
Well, we don't want you
to go away.

587
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,400
My sister has worked up a new lease.

588
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,300
We think it's very fair.
It's not market price.

589
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,400
We know that's not
even possible but,

590
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,900
still, you can't expect
to pay the same amounts

591
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,900
that you did
when you first moved in.

592
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,800
Here, just take a look at this.

593
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,500
Before we go any further
with this conversation,

594
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,200
I want you to take a look at this.

595
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,100
I am probably the last person to have

596
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,500
photos printed the old-fashioned way.

597
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,800
It's completely different than
seeing them on a cell phone,

598
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,200
don't you agree?

599
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:31,800
That's me in the backyard,
on July fourth.

600
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,500
Mm.

601
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:38,300
That's me, Tony and Max
at the Saint Anthony's fair.

602
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:44,400
That's us with my family,
when they came to visit.

603
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:49,200
Your father and I
were very good friends.

604
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,200
We spent a lot of time together.

605
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,800
What you and your sister
don't understand

606
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,700
is that your father
wanted me to stay here.

607
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:04,100
He thought of me as part of
this house, of this neighborhood.

608
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:12,400
I was more his family,
if you want to know, than you were.

609
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,600
Well, that's a ridiculous thing
to say.

610
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:22,900
You hardly talked to each other.
You never came to visit.

611
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,700
I was the one here.
I saw him every day.

612
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,200
This is not what I came here for.

613
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,500
Just, please, take a look
at the lease, okay?

614
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,800
Let's just get back to that.
It's very fair.

615
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,200
I don't need to.

616
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:41,600
I have an idea of what
you and your sister have in mind.

617
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,000
I'll just give this to my lawyer.

618
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,800
Okay, well...

619
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,800
there's nothing else
to talk about then, I guess.

620
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,200
Okay, good night, Leonor.

621
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,400
Brian, can you give me
a hand here?

622
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,300
I have to call a patient.

623
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,500
Give me a moment. Is Jake here?

624
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Yeah.

625
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,300
- Hi, Dad!
- Hi, Mr. J.

626
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,800
Jake,
you know it's a week night.

627
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,400
What are you doing
playing video games?

628
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,500
- Can Tony stay and eat with us?
- No.

629
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,700
Well, why not? He wanted to ask you
about your acting career.

630
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
That's enough for tonight.
Just turn this thing off.

631
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,800
- Dad, come on.
- I said no!

632
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,300
We're not even finished
with this level.

633
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,300
Tony, you need to go home now.

634
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,300
We can talk about acting
some other time.

635
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,800
Sure, Mr. J.

636
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:02,300
Your mom's waiting for you
downstairs.

637
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,500
Did you ask your mother?

638
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,300
She loves
when Jake comes over.

639
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:12,000
- Please, Mom? Please?
- Jake, I just made dinner.

640
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,000
I'll eat it tomorrow
for lunch, I promise.

641
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,200
Okay, but I want you back here
in the morning.

642
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,200
- Yes. Thanks, Mom.
- Thank you, Mrs. Jardine.

643
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,700
- Please, Mami?
- No, Antonio.

644
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,800
Come on, Ma,
we got spaghetti in the fridge.

645
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:41,400
No, Antonio, when I said "no,"
I mean it. Don't ask me again.

646
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,300
It'll be super quiet,
aren't we, Jake?

647
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,300
Oh, yes, we're gonna be very quiet.

648
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,000
No, Antonio, don't insist!

649
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:54,200
It's okay, Tony,
I'll see you tomorrow.

650
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:55,600
Yeah.

651
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,600
- Good night, Jake.
- Good night, Mrs. Calvelli.

652
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,400
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

653
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,600
Yo!

654
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Hey!

655
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,200
Hey, I'm not talking
to my mother anymore.

656
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,300
Why not?

657
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,800
- She said you can't come over.
- Why doesn't she want me over?

658
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,100
I don't know.

659
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,700
I don't think your dad wants me
around anymore either.

660
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,800
He may be too chicken
to tell you, but I can tell.

661
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,200
Why are they so mad at us?

662
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,900
Our parents are involved
in a business matter,

663
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,200
and it's getting ugly,
so they're taking it out on us.

664
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,900
You're right,
my dad was very cold to you.

665
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,300
I won't talk
to my parents, then, either.

666
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,300
- Really?
- Really. Not unless they apologize.

667
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,500
It's not gonna be easy.
You sure you can handle it?

668
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,000
- I can handle it.
- You're a great friend, Jake.

669
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:23,700
You too.

670
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,200
Hey.

671
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:33,200
Did something happen
with Leonor downstairs?

672
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,100
The store's closed,

673
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,700
but it's not even five.

674
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,700
Have you seen Tony?

675
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,300
Jake...

676
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,000
can you stop
joking around for a minute?

677
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,600
Did you see if the store was
open earlier when you came home?

678
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,100
Was it open?

679
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,500
No, it wasn't?

680
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,200
Jake, talk to me.

681
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:21,400
Audrey, hi.

682
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:26,000
No, no, I haven't heard from her.

683
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,900
Today I got home early
and the store was closed.

684
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:34,000
I feel responsible.
We are responsible.

685
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,300
Audrey will tell you if
she thinks you owe her money.

686
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,300
- Don't worry about it.
- Well, she sort of did already.

687
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:42,300
- What?
- Yeah.

688
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:45,000
She told me
we owe her money for the store.

689
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:47,400
- Incredible.
- Yeah.

690
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:51,400
Jake,
did you see Leonor today?

691
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:56,400
Still not talking?

692
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,400
No.

693
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:03,400
You can't go on
like this forever, you know.

694
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:12,800
You look like
you've been doing this

695
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,600
acting thing for a long time.

696
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,800
Really?

697
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,200
When you did the Emotional Recall
exercise, it seemed so natural.

698
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
My father was a stunt man
when I was a kid,

699
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:24,200
so I spent a lot of time
on sets and stuff.

700
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,400
Oh, so you've been
doing this forever.

701
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,800
Well, no, because when I was
eight years old, he died.

702
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,800
Did he die doing a stunt?

703
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:35,300
- No, he had throat cancer.
- Oh.

704
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:37,800
I'm sorry for your loss.

705
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:40,100
Thanks.

706
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,200
- I'll see you later?
- I hope so.

707
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:55,500
Hey. You know anyone
with a swimming pool?

708
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:57,000
No, Why?

709
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,300
I would kill to see her
in a bathing suit.

710
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,600
- Could you imagine?
- I never thought about that.

711
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,300
So, who do you like, huh?

712
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,800
- They're all nice.
- You can tell me, you know.

713
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,400
- Tell you what?
- If you like someone.

714
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,800
- I don't know.
- That's what you always say.

715
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,200
Well, I do have an idea
you might like.

716
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,800
Yeah? What's that?

717
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,700
Eva talked about going dancing.

718
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:30,500
There's a matinee club,
like after hours, for kids.

719
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,500
- When?
- Sunday afternoon in the city.

720
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,400
- Let's go!
- Would be fun, wouldn't it?

721
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,900
That would be great,
if I could just dance with her.

722
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,800
Wow, Jake,
that's actually getting good.

723
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,500
- I'm impressed.
- Thank you.

724
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,900
Hi, can I help you?

725
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,600
Thank you, I want to talk to Leonor.

726
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:07,000
- Hi, Leonor.
- Hi.

727
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,700
Just a second, let me finish this.

728
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,500
You're home early.

729
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,200
Monday.

730
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,200
That's right, your day off.

731
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,700
That's a cute dress.

732
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,300
I made it.

733
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,600
Leonor, do you have a minute?

734
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:38,600
I have to finish this
for a client tonight.

735
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,400
Tony still not talking?

736
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,400
Not a word to me yesterday.

737
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,700
- Same with Jake.
- It's very annoying.

738
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:51,300
One good thing, I have to say

739
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,700
is that Jake is painting
and drawing more than ever.

740
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,600
Is that good?

741
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,300
Yeah, if he really wants to go
to LaGuardia,

742
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:01,000
he has to put together a portfolio.

743
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,300
Mm.

744
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:05,600
ls Tony still thinking
of applying also?

745
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,300
How would I know?

746
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:11,000
It's been four days.
He hasn't said a word to me.

747
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,200
Listen, Leonor, you know that

748
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:18,100
I am trained in conflict resolution,
and I'm hoping to help here,

749
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:22,200
to help settle this problem
between you and our family.

750
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,900
Has your husband
asked you to do this?

751
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,300
No.

752
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,900
By the way,
he's been working very hard.

753
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:35,600
I'm not sure you know,
but he's rehearsing a new play.

754
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:39,700
No. I haven't seen your husband.

755
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:45,600
I know he's been waiting
to hear from you.

756
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:50,700
Leonor?

757
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:52,600
Not here.

758
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,900
I know you think
we're the rich people

759
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:06,700
coming into this neighborhood,

760
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:11,200
but the truth is Brian hasn't
made any money in years.

761
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,700
I've been supporting our family
with my hard work.

762
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:18,100
- That's not my problem.
- I know it's not.

763
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,400
What I want to tell you is that
we will give you time,

764
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,000
but we need this money.

765
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:26,100
We need the shop to cover its rent.

766
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,200
Not an unfair thing
to ask of a tenant.

767
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,700
The woman is trouble, Brian.

768
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:44,100
Once again, our warm,
lovable, unwise father

769
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,400
has left us a big mess
and no instructions.

770
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:52,300
I think that we should start
the eviction process right away.

771
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:55,300
I don't wanna have to do that.

772
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,200
It takes a while, you know.

773
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,800
I just don't want this to get ugly.

774
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:04,400
The boys are best friends now.

775
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:09,500
Just remember our dad worked
hard to leave us something,

776
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:13,700
and now you have this
nice big apartment to live in,

777
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,300
and I'm getting nothing.

778
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,300
Just give me a little more time.

779
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:24,400
I can't really do this
without you, Brian.

780
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,900
Hey, do you want to come
to the beach with me?

781
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,000
- Huh?
- The beach!

782
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:38,900
You, me.

783
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:41,900
Yes? No?

784
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:44,700
No, Tony, you're really nice
and everything,

785
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:46,400
but I'm into older guys.

786
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:51,500
Oh.

787
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,800
- Thank you for being honest.
- What?

788
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,800
Thank you for being honest!

789
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,000
She doesn't acknowledge the lease,

790
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:41,000
she doesn't try and negotiate,
she has no plans on leaving.

791
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,700
Now she's actually hiring new people.

792
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:47,100
I told you
this was not gonna be easy.

793
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,800
Audrey wants to start
an eviction process.

794
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:56,100
She's got a lawyer
ready to go already.

795
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,200
Good.

796
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:04,400
So it's decided.

797
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:10,700
Is it?

798
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:16,900
Who's gonna tell Jake?

799
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,600
I'll do it.

800
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:23,600
It's my problem.

801
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:26,800
Do it soon.

802
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:29,900
Please?

803
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,000
What are you writing?

804
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,600
An idea for a short story.

805
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:58,800
A young girl grows up on the shores
of a lake, as you have done.

806
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,000
She loves the lake,

807
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,200
as the gulls do

808
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,500
and she is as free
and as happy as they are.

809
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:12,900
But a man sees her, who
happens to come by that way...

810
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,500
and he destroys her out of idleness,

811
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,300
as this seagull here
has been destroyed.

812
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:22,300
Boris! Where are you?

813
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:24,300
I'm coming this minute!

814
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:27,200
What do you want?

815
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:31,100
We are not going away after all!

816
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,200
It is a dream!

817
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,300
So?

818
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:27,000
Did you understand why
Nina says she's the seagull?

819
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:39,500
Jake, it's your father's
opening night.

820
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,000
You two ever think about anybody
other than yourselves?

821
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:55,700
Huh?

822
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,900
Say something, Jake!

823
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:02,000
Say something!

824
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,400
One of the hardest things
to realize when you're a child

825
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,600
is that your parents are people too,
you understand that?

826
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:12,500
They care about things.
They make mistakes.

827
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,400
But they try to do what they think
is the right thing to do.

828
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:18,200
Does any of what I'm saying
make any sense to you?

829
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:21,100
What's so funny, Tony?

830
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:23,100
Huh?

831
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,400
Why don't you tell me,
what's so funny, Tony?

832
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,600
You think you got it in you
to be an actor?

833
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,900
Take one rejection after another?

834
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:32,100
We'll see how you react when
you don't get into LaGuardia!

835
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:33,700
- We'll just see then!
- Brian!

836
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:35,000
Goddamn it!

837
01:00:54,800 --> 01:00:57,400
Also try to arrange them
by color or tone.

838
01:00:57,800 --> 01:01:00,200
I usually like to start with
lighter colors in the front,

839
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,000
and end with the darker ones.

840
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,300
Black goes in the back.

841
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,200
Hello, can we help you?

842
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:10,400
Oh, it's okay, Valentina,
it's for me.

843
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:14,800
He is Brian Jardine, our neighbor.

844
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:18,700
- He's a great actor.
- Oh, have I seen you in anything?

845
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:22,000
- I doubt it.
- He's in a new play.

846
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,900
- What is it called?
<i>- The Seagull.</i>

847
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:28,100
Oh, that must be very popular.

848
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:35,200
Can you give me
five minutes alone, please?

849
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:06,700
The day your father died,

850
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:10,200
he came by in the morning.

851
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:15,500
And I asked him to buy me
a pack of cigarettes.

852
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,900
And I never saw him again.

853
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:29,300
He cared about me, Brian.

854
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:31,600
Can you believe that?

855
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:35,300
Every day we'd...

856
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:39,700
talk and share things.

857
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:45,900
Have you ever had
a friend like that?

858
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:48,500
Someone you can tell anything?

859
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,700
Only my wife.

860
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,400
I'm a lot like Jake, I...

861
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,100
It's never been easy for me
to have...

862
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:05,800
close friends.

863
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:08,800
I hope...

864
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,400
that you can understand

865
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:15,800
that what's happening
is nothing personal.

866
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:21,500
I can't pay three times...

867
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,400
what I paid to your father.

868
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,600
It's not possible.

869
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:32,000
I can't survive.

870
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:39,500
I thought you were in a new big play.

871
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:45,300
I am in a new play, but it's not big,

872
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:48,000
and it's not a lot of money.

873
01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:51,600
It's just the way that it is, Leonor.

874
01:03:52,900 --> 01:03:56,700
I'm fortunate that my father
left me a house in Brooklyn.

875
01:03:57,300 --> 01:04:00,300
He wanted me to stay here.
He told me so.

876
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:02,300
And I also have a sister,

877
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:05,900
and she has a family too,
and we have to decide

878
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:10,100
what to do about this together.
It's not just up to me.

879
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,100
You know,
your father thought your sister

880
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:16,300
was the one who inherited his brains.

881
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:22,500
I'm sure he'd agree with Audrey...

882
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:25,200
that above all else...

883
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,800
it's important
to take care of business.

884
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:31,900
No, he wouldn't have.

885
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:34,300
I can promise you.

886
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:36,500
What do you want me to say, Leonor?

887
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:39,400
I have a family. We have bills, too.

888
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,300
Do you know why your father

889
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:46,900
didn't come to your son's birthday,
the last one?

890
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:48,700
He had the flu.

891
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:52,000
Maybe that's what he told you.

892
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:55,800
The truth is he was embarrassed

893
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,900
that everything in your house
was paid for by your wife.

894
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,300
He thought you should be
more of a man.

895
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:09,300
Well...

896
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:14,600
he's not around anymore...

897
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:17,500
is he?

898
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:20,900
He's certainly not.

899
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:45,000
Unfortunately, it's a clause that's
common in any commercial contract.

900
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:01,000
What am I going to do?

901
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:03,000
I can't afford this.

902
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:06,000
I told you not to go outside.

903
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:08,200
I told you not to go outside, Antonio!

904
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:12,800
I am up to here with this game of yours.

905
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,700
Hernán:
I'm sorry Leo.

906
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:22,400
Where do they get this number?

907
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,400
It's a penalty.

908
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,100
It's a penalty for overstaying.
That's why it's in the contract.

909
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:39,800
And there's nothing we can do?

910
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,300
Hernán: I've done everything I can.
There's nothing to do.

911
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,300
You have one week.

912
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:54,000
Una semana para abandonar este lugar.

913
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:04,500
One week to leave the premises.

914
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:08,800
Mami?

915
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:47,100
Hello, Mr. J.
Is, um... Jake home?

916
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:49,800
Yes.

917
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,300
He's doing his homework.

918
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:56,600
Um, I'd like to talk
to him, if I could.

919
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:00,700
Of course.

920
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:04,700
Come in. Why don't you
both come in, please?

921
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:23,000
Are you sure we can't
get you something, Leonor?

922
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:28,200
I'm fine, thanks.

923
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:33,500
- Mom!
- What's going on?

924
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:36,600
Mom, Tony told me Leonor's
being evacuated from the store!

925
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:39,200
It's not "evacuated,"
it's "evicted."

926
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:41,700
How could you do that?
How could you do that to them?

927
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:43,600
It's a terrible situation.

928
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:46,600
The rent is too expensive!
She can't afford it, Mom.

929
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:49,500
So Dad just needs to give her
a discount or something so she can.

930
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,800
Your mother and I tried to
talk to you about this, Jake.

931
01:08:52,100 --> 01:08:53,100
This not talking didn't help.

932
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:55,700
- Don't blame this on him.
- It's okay, I'm talking now.

933
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,200
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'll never do that again.

934
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,700
- I promise, Dad, I promise.
- Calm down. Jake, calm down.

935
01:09:00,900 --> 01:09:04,200
- But I have a great idea...
- Listen to me. Your Grandpa Max,

936
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:06,900
he didn't just leave this house
for the three of us here.

937
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:09,700
No, I know, he loved Leonor, too.
Tony told me!

938
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,400
Of course he liked Leonor,

939
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:14,300
but he left it for us
and for your Aunt Audrey.

940
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:17,500
But I have a great idea.
We go back to our old apartment,

941
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:19,900
and we rent this place and give
the money to Aunt Audrey.

942
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:22,400
Tony and I are both going to be going

943
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:25,200
to the LaGuardia High School for
Performing Arts in Manhattan,

944
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:28,000
so I don't need to take the
subway or anything to school.

945
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:31,500
I could just walk.
And you'll be closer to the theater.

946
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:35,600
I loved the show, Dad,
I loved it. I really did.

947
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:39,200
Tony did, too. We both talked
about it a lot afterwards.

948
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:41,200
And I thought
you were really good,

949
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:43,500
and I thought it was
really complex and everything.

950
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:46,000
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you then, I'm sorry,

951
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,800
but I really liked it, I did.

952
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:53,500
Okay, okay.

953
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:56,900
Okay.

954
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,100
Mr. Jardine?

955
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:33,500
- Where were you, son?
- I'm sorry, Dad.

956
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,500
You still have a lot to do
to finish your portfolio?

957
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,700
I just need to finish one more
painting, and then I'm done.

958
01:12:47,400 --> 01:12:48,900
That's what you said last week.

959
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:51,600
You just had to finish
one more painting.

960
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,300
I want them to be good.

961
01:12:56,900 --> 01:13:00,500
Do you remember, by any chance,
a story about my friend Tina?

962
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:04,200
The one that sold her hair
in India for a train ticket?

963
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:06,700
No, that was Martine.

964
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:09,900
Tina was a girl I went to
high school with, she was a...

965
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:13,000
Oh. She was a dancer.

966
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:18,000
And her mother was a dancer. She was
literally born to be a dancer.

967
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:23,200
And during high school, she got
into a really good conservatory,

968
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:27,100
and I saw her a couple of times
after that, and

969
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:30,200
she was always getting ready
to get this or gonna get that.

970
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:33,100
Each time,
her arm would be in a sling,

971
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:36,100
or she would be on crutches.

972
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:40,400
And the last time I saw her,
I ran into her on the subway.

973
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:43,100
It was clear
she hadn't danced in years.

974
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:45,000
She was completely out of shape.

975
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:47,900
You would have never imagined
that this was the same girl.

976
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:51,500
Gee, thanks, Dad.

977
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:54,200
That's a very encouraging story.

978
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:56,200
Why didn't Tina go very far?

979
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:59,800
- I don't know.
- She trained too hard.

980
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:01,900
Huh?

981
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:04,100
She practiced too much.

982
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:07,900
She didn't just trust
her natural abilities.

983
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:11,900
Jake, you're gonna meet a lot of
really talented people in your life,

984
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:14,700
and they're not all
gonna be suited to be artists.

985
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,900
They're not all gonna
have the brains to know

986
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:19,900
when to insist and when to...

987
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:22,700
to stop.

988
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:27,700
When to push themselves
and when to just relax.

989
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:31,600
Most of them
won't all have that balance.

990
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,300
And how do I know
if I have the balance?

991
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,700
That's why I'm telling you this,
because

992
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:40,100
you're turning in
your portfolio soon.

993
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:42,100
And they're gonna love it.

994
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,100
I know they are.

995
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:49,600
And they're gonna love you.

996
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:53,700
And you're gonna go to LaGuardia.

997
01:14:55,900 --> 01:14:57,400
And you're gonna have fun...

998
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:00,100
and some challenges, too.

999
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:03,100
But soon enough,
you're gonna find out

1000
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:04,600
if you have that balance.

1001
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:11,700
Do you know if Tony's still applying?

1002
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:15,900
I don't know,
I don't know what he's doing.

1003
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,100
Well, I wish I had
handled that differently, son.

1004
01:15:22,700 --> 01:15:26,600
- What do you mean?
- Just Tony and his mom.

1005
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:32,100
I wish I had told you earlier
what was going on.

1006
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:34,300
Would it have changed anything?

1007
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:37,200
No.

1008
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,000
Probably not.

1009
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:42,300
But Still.

1010
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,800
Dad, would you mind
if I played one of my video games?

1011
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:06,700
Would that be okay?

1012
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:10,800
Of course.

1013
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Will Mom be okay with it?

1014
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:20,300
I think so.
