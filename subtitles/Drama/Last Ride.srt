1
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,320
Hello. Have you got a bathroom?

2
00:03:21,407 --> 00:03:23,399
Yeah, it's just out the back.

3
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,659
I'd like a burger and a coffee.
Get what you like.

4
00:04:17,663 --> 00:04:19,703
You look weird.

5
00:04:34,887 --> 00:04:36,381
Jesus!

6
00:04:37,473 --> 00:04:39,511
- Oh, for fuck's...

7
00:04:39,599 --> 00:04:41,591
Jesus! Fuckin' hell.

8
00:04:41,684 --> 00:04:43,179
Why do you have to
fuckin' do that?

9
00:04:43,269 --> 00:04:44,727
Yeah, go and wash your face.

10
00:04:45,813 --> 00:04:47,853
And get in the car, right?

11
00:05:44,197 --> 00:05:46,236
Chook?

12
00:05:48,368 --> 00:05:50,406
Yeah, that one.

13
00:05:51,494 --> 00:05:53,535
Stay there.

14
00:06:18,601 --> 00:06:20,096
Righto. We're off.

15
00:06:20,186 --> 00:06:21,680
What's that say?

16
00:06:22,772 --> 00:06:24,812
It says, "Koori rulz.
The only bet is on black."

17
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:46,705
Well, that's yours.

18
00:07:01,346 --> 00:07:02,841
Who are you fighting?

19
00:07:02,932 --> 00:07:04,722
Aliens.

20
00:07:04,808 --> 00:07:06,516
They steal people,
especially from parks.

21
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,939
I don't want to sleep here.

22
00:07:43,049 --> 00:07:45,089
So, what do they look like,
these aliens?

23
00:07:48,262 --> 00:07:50,302
Like us, but...

24
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:53,430
...skinny, and they've got one eye

25
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,599
and they come from the stars.

26
00:08:03,902 --> 00:08:05,940
It's a clear night. It's beautiful.

27
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:15,324
Do you know how to reckon dead south
by the Southern Cross?

28
00:09:25,222 --> 00:09:26,715
Those?

29
00:09:26,805 --> 00:09:28,597
Mm.

30
00:09:28,682 --> 00:09:30,556
Um...

31
00:09:30,643 --> 00:09:32,551
- What about those?
- Mm.

32
00:09:32,644 --> 00:09:34,103
Oh, you like them, do you?

33
00:09:34,187 --> 00:09:35,895
No, those are plastic, mate.

34
00:09:35,981 --> 00:09:37,355
Oh.

35
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,721
Alright.

36
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:47,070
Whatever you do, don't say
nothin' about Max, understand?

37
00:09:48,157 --> 00:09:50,196
Yep.

38
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:11,048
- Surprise.

39
00:10:12,137 --> 00:10:13,632
Ta-da!

40
00:10:13,722 --> 00:10:15,513
Oh, Chook!

41
00:10:15,598 --> 00:10:17,305
Hey! Look at you!

42
00:10:18,392 --> 00:10:20,431
Oh, he's alright. He won't bite.

43
00:10:20,518 --> 00:10:22,511
Hello. What's your name?

44
00:10:22,604 --> 00:10:24,597
- Come in.

45
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,730
We're on our way to Adelaide

46
00:10:27,817 --> 00:10:29,810
and, uh, we thought you might
be good for breakfast.

47
00:10:39,244 --> 00:10:41,283
How'd you get my address?

48
00:10:41,371 --> 00:10:42,864
Old Max.

49
00:10:42,955 --> 00:10:44,699
How is the old darling?

50
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,498
Oh, he's fine.

51
00:10:49,669 --> 00:10:51,709
- You can't stay.
- No, no.

52
00:10:51,796 --> 00:10:53,788
No, we don't want to.

53
00:10:55,924 --> 00:10:57,964
Hey, the boy's hungry.

54
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:14,644
Fuckin' get out of it.

55
00:11:19,904 --> 00:11:21,943
You had enough?

56
00:11:22,031 --> 00:11:24,023
Full as a goog.

57
00:11:25,117 --> 00:11:27,155
Come here.

58
00:11:28,244 --> 00:11:30,284
What's this on you?

59
00:11:30,371 --> 00:11:32,363
Um, why don't you go outside
and play with the mutt, yeah,

60
00:11:33,457 --> 00:11:35,497
while me and Maryanne have a chat.

61
00:11:35,584 --> 00:11:37,576
He'll play with that ball all day.

62
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:39,662
Come on, Mr Right. Attaboy!

63
00:11:43,883 --> 00:11:45,922
Mr Right!

64
00:11:51,181 --> 00:11:53,220
So, what's going on this time?

65
00:11:54,308 --> 00:11:56,347
What can't a man do
a bit of travelling?

66
00:11:59,521 --> 00:12:01,560
No, I thought I'd show Chook
a bit of the country.

67
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,688
You know, he needs to learn
a thing or two.

68
00:12:04,776 --> 00:12:06,768
He needs school and a good home.

69
00:12:08,905 --> 00:12:10,944
Yeah.

70
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:12,526
What like this one?

71
00:12:12,616 --> 00:12:14,360
It's a start.

72
00:12:14,451 --> 00:12:16,159
Must be costing.

73
00:12:18,288 --> 00:12:20,327
Only for materials.

74
00:12:21,415 --> 00:12:22,909
Oh, yeah.

75
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,791
What you got yourself a handyman?

76
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:26,584
What I've got is a regular job.

77
00:12:27,671 --> 00:12:29,711
You should try it.

78
00:12:36,012 --> 00:12:38,050
You're nesting, aren't ya?

79
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:41,179
Eh?

80
00:12:42,266 --> 00:12:44,306
Sort of... preparing for a brood.

81
00:12:47,479 --> 00:12:49,519
What if I am?

82
00:12:50,607 --> 00:12:52,646
Yeah, but does the handyman know
what he's in for?

83
00:12:53,734 --> 00:12:55,229
Yep.

84
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,814
Keen as.

85
00:12:58,948 --> 00:13:00,987
Did you tell him how you paid
your way through teacher's college?

86
00:13:03,118 --> 00:13:05,157
Yeah. He loves it.

87
00:13:08,332 --> 00:13:10,370
Fuck, I missed you.

88
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,450
- Bullshit.
- No, honest.

89
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,711
I haven't looked at another woman
since you left.

90
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,839
Just fucked a few?

91
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,919
Hey.

92
00:13:26,054 --> 00:13:28,094
No, you've got a nice set-up here.

93
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,174
We might just have to move in.
Chooky would love that.

94
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,349
Please...

95
00:13:35,438 --> 00:13:37,477
You're not gonna fuck up
my life again.

96
00:13:37,565 --> 00:13:39,557
No, it's alright.

97
00:13:42,735 --> 00:13:44,774
But how about one last one for old
time's sake and then we'll be off?

98
00:13:45,864 --> 00:13:47,902
Promise you'll leave?

99
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,982
Yeah, yeah. Scout's honour.

100
00:14:40,077 --> 00:14:42,116
What's up?

101
00:14:48,417 --> 00:14:50,456
Nothin'.

102
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,487
What you up to?

103
00:15:28,577 --> 00:15:30,071
Nothing.

104
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,798
- Are you Dad's girlfriend again?
- No.

105
00:15:56,184 --> 00:15:58,223
Can I stay with you?

106
00:16:00,354 --> 00:16:02,394
You're going to Adelaide,
aren't you?

107
00:16:04,524 --> 00:16:06,564
You'll like Adelaide.

108
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,820
What you been up to?

109
00:16:13,907 --> 00:16:15,947
Tell me about
when you first met Dad.

110
00:16:17,036 --> 00:16:18,530
You know that story.

111
00:16:18,621 --> 00:16:20,412
Come on.

112
00:16:20,497 --> 00:16:21,825
Chook!

113
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,243
Please!

114
00:16:27,461 --> 00:16:29,501
It was in jail.

115
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:31,082
Um...

116
00:16:31,172 --> 00:16:32,916
I was teaching maths.

117
00:16:33,008 --> 00:16:34,716
And your dad was in my class.

118
00:16:38,929 --> 00:16:40,968
And, um, when he got out,
we hooked up

119
00:16:43,099 --> 00:16:45,139
and... I met you...

120
00:16:46,227 --> 00:16:48,267
...which was the best bit.

121
00:16:50,398 --> 00:16:52,437
And then we all lobbed on Max.

122
00:16:53,526 --> 00:16:55,565
We had a lot of fun
there for a while, remember?

123
00:16:57,695 --> 00:16:59,735
Mm-hm.

124
00:17:01,866 --> 00:17:03,905
And then, um...

125
00:17:04,994 --> 00:17:07,034
...you know the rest.

126
00:17:07,121 --> 00:17:13,288
Dad reckons he really didn't mean
to hit you. He just lost his temper.

127
00:17:16,461 --> 00:17:18,502
Does he hit you?

128
00:17:22,718 --> 00:17:24,756
You know there are lots of people
who love you.

129
00:17:26,888 --> 00:17:28,927
Me, for one...

130
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:31,007
...and Max.

131
00:17:32,101 --> 00:17:34,140
And Dad?

132
00:17:35,227 --> 00:17:37,267
And Dad.

133
00:17:40,441 --> 00:17:42,480
How you going
with your maths, anyway?

134
00:17:42,568 --> 00:17:44,560
Are you still the world's best
number rememberer?

135
00:17:44,653 --> 00:17:46,147
Yeah.

136
00:17:46,237 --> 00:17:47,981
Hey, do you remember
my old Sigma's rego number?

137
00:17:50,867 --> 00:17:52,905
I hated that car.

138
00:17:55,037 --> 00:17:57,075
What about...

139
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,244
It's funny,
the numbers you remember.

140
00:18:02,334 --> 00:18:04,374
You're really good with numbers.

141
00:18:07,547 --> 00:18:09,587
And what about Max's phone number?

142
00:18:11,718 --> 00:18:13,757
Oh, come on. You remember that.

143
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:17,383
<i>Do you remember it?</i>

144
00:18:17,473 --> 00:18:19,264
Yeah, course.

145
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:21,058
Maybe you could ring him
just to see if he's alright.

146
00:18:23,187 --> 00:18:25,225
Why wouldn't he be alright?

147
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:27,306
Outta there, mate! It's time to go.

148
00:18:35,696 --> 00:18:37,736
- Do we have to go?
- Thanks for breakfast.

149
00:18:39,867 --> 00:18:41,907
And you won't be telling anyone
we've been here, eh?

150
00:18:42,995 --> 00:18:45,035
Who'll be asking?

151
00:18:46,123 --> 00:18:48,162
Thanks.

152
00:18:59,677 --> 00:19:01,170
See ya.

153
00:19:01,262 --> 00:19:02,754
'Bye!

154
00:19:23,655 --> 00:19:25,694
Are we really
going to Adelaide?

155
00:19:27,825 --> 00:19:29,864
No.

156
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,078
Yep.

157
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,660
Just slide your body back, mate.

158
00:21:14,751 --> 00:21:16,210
Ow! Hey, Dad!

159
00:21:30,849 --> 00:21:32,888
Here. Take those.

160
00:21:46,487 --> 00:21:48,527
What is this place?

161
00:21:54,828 --> 00:21:56,866
Sort of like a museum, I guess.

162
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:02,080
It's spooky.

163
00:22:14,636 --> 00:22:16,676
Dad?

164
00:22:16,763 --> 00:22:18,755
Do you reckon Max will be alright?

165
00:22:20,891 --> 00:22:22,930
Yeah, Jimmy would have found him.

166
00:22:25,062 --> 00:22:27,102
Why'd you hit him?

167
00:22:29,232 --> 00:22:31,272
Mate, I didn't have no choice.

168
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:33,352
- Why?
- I just didn't.

169
00:22:40,701 --> 00:22:42,740
He'll be alright, though?

170
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:44,819
Yeah. I reckon.

171
00:22:59,467 --> 00:23:01,505
There's Shamrozi Khan and his camels.

172
00:23:07,807 --> 00:23:09,847
They were Afghans
and they had these camels.

173
00:23:10,935 --> 00:23:12,974
That's what they used
before they had trains.

174
00:23:16,148 --> 00:23:18,187
Your great-great-grandfather
was one of them.

175
00:23:19,275 --> 00:23:21,315
Wasn't he a blackfella?

176
00:23:22,403 --> 00:23:24,442
No, mate, that was his missus.

177
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:26,522
So are we "Afghagans'?

178
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:30,697
Oh, yeah, a bit, I s'pose,
but not really.

179
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:35,911
We're blackfellas, then.

180
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,038
No, we're mongrels, us.

181
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,209
We're whatever we wanna be.

182
00:23:58,893 --> 00:24:00,932
I'm gonna get us something to eat.
You stay here.

183
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:03,012
But I don't want to
be here by myself.

184
00:24:04,106 --> 00:24:06,145
Just stay here.
Don't make any noise, alright?

185
00:24:06,233 --> 00:24:08,225
Don't go outside.

186
00:24:08,318 --> 00:24:09,812
But, Dad...

187
00:24:09,903 --> 00:24:11,361
Won't be long.

188
00:24:51,021 --> 00:24:53,061
Here, chook, chook, chook.

189
00:25:56,745 --> 00:25:58,738
Dad?

190
00:26:14,427 --> 00:26:15,922
Haven't seen you before.

191
00:26:16,012 --> 00:26:17,505
<i>Well, I haven't seen you before.</i>

192
00:26:21,726 --> 00:26:23,764
What's for tea?

193
00:26:23,852 --> 00:26:25,345
Uh...

194
00:26:25,436 --> 00:26:26,895
The fuckin' usual. Beans.

195
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:30,020
Do you want to join me?

196
00:26:31,108 --> 00:26:33,146
I don't like beans.

197
00:26:33,234 --> 00:26:35,227
Oh, I've got spaghetti.

198
00:26:37,447 --> 00:26:39,439
You right, mate?

199
00:26:39,532 --> 00:26:41,489
I'm good, brother.

200
00:27:34,704 --> 00:27:36,744
All good, bro?

201
00:27:37,833 --> 00:27:39,326
Oi, come here!

202
00:27:55,556 --> 00:27:57,595
Get the fuck away!

203
00:28:26,832 --> 00:28:28,872
Oh, fuck.

204
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:57,519
Allahu akbar.

205
00:29:03,323 --> 00:29:05,362
Allahu akbar.

206
00:29:07,493 --> 00:29:09,533
Allahu akbar.

207
00:29:14,792 --> 00:29:16,830
Allahu Akbar.

208
00:29:35,642 --> 00:29:37,682
What are you doing here?

209
00:29:47,111 --> 00:29:49,149
Are you here by yourself?

210
00:29:50,238 --> 00:29:52,278
Are you an Afghan?

211
00:29:52,365 --> 00:29:54,357
No.

212
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:56,442
My family are from India.

213
00:29:57,537 --> 00:29:59,575
Do you live here?

214
00:29:59,663 --> 00:30:01,656
In town? Yes. I work with
the Flying Doctor Service.

215
00:30:02,749 --> 00:30:04,787
Do you fly planes?

216
00:30:04,876 --> 00:30:06,869
No. I'm a doctor.

217
00:30:07,962 --> 00:30:10,001
Do you think you could
fly somewhere to help someone?

218
00:30:28,813 --> 00:30:30,308
Hello.

219
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:31,891
This little chap was a bit worried
about someone who's hurt.

220
00:30:35,069 --> 00:30:36,563
Max, is it?

221
00:30:36,654 --> 00:30:38,147
Are you Max?

222
00:30:40,282 --> 00:30:42,321
Where's the keys?

223
00:30:44,452 --> 00:30:46,491
Where's the fuckin' keys?!

224
00:30:49,665 --> 00:30:51,704
Unlock the car and put
our stuff in. And get that shit off!

225
00:30:54,877 --> 00:30:56,917
Fuckin' do it!

226
00:31:59,517 --> 00:32:01,556
I'm hungry.

227
00:32:04,729 --> 00:32:06,768
Yeah, well, there's a store
somewhere along here.

228
00:32:10,985 --> 00:32:13,025
<i>Me and my dad used to come out here.</i>

229
00:32:14,113 --> 00:32:16,151
Except he left me out here
on me own once

230
00:32:16,239 --> 00:32:18,232
you know, to teach me a lesson.

231
00:32:22,453 --> 00:32:24,492
And I had to walk all night and day
before I found someone.

232
00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:29,705
Didn't he want you?

233
00:32:29,793 --> 00:32:31,785
No. I was just a nuisance to him.

234
00:32:46,433 --> 00:32:48,471
Right. That'll do it.

235
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:56,812
$125.

236
00:32:58,942 --> 00:33:00,982
Oh, come on, lady.
It can't be that much.

237
00:33:02,071 --> 00:33:04,110
$125.

238
00:33:08,326 --> 00:33:10,365
Well, I've only got 90.

239
00:33:29,178 --> 00:33:31,216
$89.20.

240
00:33:48,986 --> 00:33:51,026
You little bugger.

241
00:35:20,732 --> 00:35:22,771
I need to go to the toilet.

242
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,899
No, not here, mate.

243
00:35:25,986 --> 00:35:27,979
Why?

244
00:35:28,072 --> 00:35:30,065
Oh, 'cause we're Butch and Sundance.

245
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,240
Who?

246
00:36:06,605 --> 00:36:08,100
Hey, give us a hand, mate.

247
00:36:08,191 --> 00:36:09,684
Get some firewood.

248
00:36:18,074 --> 00:36:20,112
Chooky?

249
00:36:41,011 --> 00:36:43,049
Look. It's gravity
that holds the tea in.

250
00:36:45,181 --> 00:36:47,219
No, it's wind.

251
00:36:47,307 --> 00:36:49,299
What do you mean "wind'?

252
00:36:49,392 --> 00:36:51,385
Well, when it goes across,
the wind goes like that

253
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,560
and you make wind.

254
00:36:56,649 --> 00:36:58,688
I think you're just makin' that up.

255
00:36:58,775 --> 00:37:00,768
Well, it's not wind but it makes
a sort of a lid made out of wind

256
00:37:02,903 --> 00:37:04,943
to keep the water in.

257
00:37:12,287 --> 00:37:14,326
Ya!

258
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:09,877
What you doing with that?

259
00:38:09,962 --> 00:38:11,836
Playing Snake.

260
00:38:45,076 --> 00:38:47,115
Doesn't work out here, does it?

261
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:17,349
Come on in, mate.

262
00:39:21,565 --> 00:39:23,606
Oh, come on, you wuss.

263
00:39:29,906 --> 00:39:31,945
Come on, mate.

264
00:39:38,247 --> 00:39:39,741
Are you sure you don't wanna?

265
00:39:39,832 --> 00:39:41,622
Uh-uh.

266
00:39:41,708 --> 00:39:43,416
No? Not even for me?

267
00:39:44,502 --> 00:39:45,995
No!

268
00:39:46,086 --> 00:39:47,331
Aaagh!

269
00:39:47,421 --> 00:39:49,046
Don't! Stop, Dad!

270
00:39:49,131 --> 00:39:50,708
- Ready to swim?
- Aaagh! Aaagh! Don't!

271
00:39:52,843 --> 00:39:54,882
Dad!

272
00:39:57,013 --> 00:39:59,052
- I can't swim!
- What's that?

273
00:40:00,725 --> 00:40:01,922
I can't swim!

274
00:40:02,017 --> 00:40:03,215
- Best way to learn...
- Aaagh!

275
00:40:08,523 --> 00:40:10,562
Come on! Swim, mate!

276
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,643
Swim, swim! Swim!

277
00:40:28,332 --> 00:40:30,324
There you go.
Your first swimming lesson.

278
00:41:20,418 --> 00:41:22,458
Oh, fuck.

279
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:27,670
G'day, there.

280
00:41:28,759 --> 00:41:30,798
G'day.

281
00:41:33,972 --> 00:41:36,011
Hey, go get some more wood
for the fire, mate.

282
00:41:37,099 --> 00:41:38,593
That's why we're here.

283
00:41:38,684 --> 00:41:40,475
You can't have a fire, mate.

284
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,434
And you can't camp here either.

285
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,347
Oh, sorry, bro.
Like, I didn't realise.

286
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,933
Alright?

287
00:41:47,024 --> 00:41:48,518
I've been coming out here since
I was a little kid, you know, and...

288
00:41:51,695 --> 00:41:53,735
...like, we need to cook and keep warm.

289
00:41:54,823 --> 00:41:56,861
It's a national park now, mate.

290
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:58,943
Yeah, I know. Good thing.

291
00:42:00,036 --> 00:42:02,074
If you was in a camping area,
then you could have a fire.

292
00:42:03,163 --> 00:42:05,203
Yeah, but, well, I...

293
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:08,330
I hate wakin' up and seeing
other people's fuckin' washing.

294
00:42:09,419 --> 00:42:10,913
You know what I mean?

295
00:42:11,004 --> 00:42:12,497
And, um, I want him to have,
like, a real bush experience.

296
00:42:21,929 --> 00:42:23,968
One night, OK?

297
00:42:24,057 --> 00:42:26,049
Yeah? That'd be great.

298
00:42:26,142 --> 00:42:28,135
How about a brew cup of tea,
before you go?

299
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:31,764
Yeah. Why not?

300
00:42:31,855 --> 00:42:33,349
Unc? Cup of tea?

301
00:42:38,945 --> 00:42:40,652
No, you gotta go, "Bzzz!"
And...together.

302
00:42:43,824 --> 00:42:45,317
You go...

303
00:42:56,334 --> 00:42:57,828
Can't he speak?

304
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,711
Yeah. Course he can.

305
00:42:59,796 --> 00:43:01,669
Just chooses not to.

306
00:43:01,755 --> 00:43:03,582
Too much jibber-jabber
humbug, eh, Uncle?

307
00:43:07,802 --> 00:43:09,842
I'm a blackfella too, sort of.

308
00:43:10,931 --> 00:43:12,969
My great-grandmother,
she was a full-blood.

309
00:43:15,101 --> 00:43:17,140
Yeah, course you are.

310
00:43:20,314 --> 00:43:22,353
You must have been born
in the middle of the day. See?

311
00:43:24,484 --> 00:43:26,523
You got that fair skin
and blue eyes.

312
00:43:28,654 --> 00:43:30,693
I was born
in the middle of the night,

313
00:43:30,781 --> 00:43:32,773
so I've got brown skin
and brown eyes.

314
00:43:34,909 --> 00:43:36,949
Koori rulz. The only bet
is on black.

315
00:43:37,036 --> 00:43:39,029
Hey! You really are a blackfella!

316
00:44:02,016 --> 00:44:04,055
Anyone home?

317
00:44:10,357 --> 00:44:12,395
Anyone home?

318
00:45:02,485 --> 00:45:04,524
I'll sleep well tonight.

319
00:45:09,783 --> 00:45:11,822
Hey.

320
00:45:12,911 --> 00:45:14,951
This bloke went to a fancy dress party
with a woman on his shoulders.

321
00:45:18,123 --> 00:45:20,163
And, uh, the people
at the party said,

322
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,745
"Well, what have you come as?"

323
00:45:21,835 --> 00:45:23,578
And he says, "Oh, I've come
as a tortoise."

324
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:27,507
And they said, "Well, why have you
got a woman on your shoulders?"

325
00:45:27,507 --> 00:45:29,546
And he said, "Oh, that's Michelle."

326
00:45:34,304 --> 00:45:36,095
Why is that funny?

327
00:45:36,181 --> 00:45:37,888
Michelle, mate. Michelle.
Michelle my shell. Get it?

328
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:47,269
Why won't a cannibal eat a clown?

329
00:45:50,443 --> 00:45:51,937
Dunno.

330
00:45:52,028 --> 00:45:53,522
'Cause he thinks it tastes funny.

331
00:45:59,827 --> 00:46:01,865
Hey, where would you find
a dog with no legs?

332
00:46:01,953 --> 00:46:03,946
I don't know.

333
00:46:04,038 --> 00:46:06,031
Where you fuckin' left him.

334
00:46:11,836 --> 00:46:13,331
Oh. Hang on.

335
00:46:32,146 --> 00:46:34,184
Come on!

336
00:46:39,443 --> 00:46:41,483
Oh! Good-lookin' bastard, eh?

337
00:46:42,572 --> 00:46:44,611
- You just press that button there.
- Press that. Righto.

338
00:46:44,698 --> 00:46:46,691
- And then press OK.
- Right. Get back.

339
00:46:48,827 --> 00:46:50,866
Are you ready?

340
00:46:51,955 --> 00:46:53,995
- Fuck.

341
00:46:54,082 --> 00:46:56,074
- Who's that ugly shit?
- Hey!

342
00:46:59,294 --> 00:47:01,286
- Do you want a look?
- OK.

343
00:47:13,348 --> 00:47:16,680
Hey, do you see those six
bright stars up there, all together?

344
00:47:18,019 --> 00:47:19,513
Mm.

345
00:47:19,604 --> 00:47:21,098
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

346
00:47:23,232 --> 00:47:27,360
Well, the blackfellas reckon
there uused to be seven of them.

347
00:47:27,403 --> 00:47:29,441
They were called the Seven Sisters.

348
00:47:31,572 --> 00:47:33,611
What happened to the other sister?

349
00:47:33,699 --> 00:47:35,691
Uh, well, she came down to earth.

350
00:47:37,828 --> 00:47:39,866
Like an alien.

351
00:47:39,954 --> 00:47:41,947
No, mate. No.

352
00:47:44,082 --> 00:47:46,123
Um, she was more like a mother.

353
00:47:51,381 --> 00:47:53,420
Well, that's what
the blackfellas reckon anyway.

354
00:48:00,764 --> 00:48:02,803
How come my mum left me?

355
00:48:07,019 --> 00:48:09,059
I dunno.

356
00:48:12,232 --> 00:48:14,272
Did you hit her too?

357
00:48:18,487 --> 00:48:20,527
Nah, that wasn't the reason.

358
00:48:23,701 --> 00:48:27,284
I dunno, some women just aren't
meant to be mothers, I s'pose.

359
00:48:29,956 --> 00:48:31,995
Sheep don't leave their lambs.

360
00:48:36,211 --> 00:48:38,250
Well, sometimes they do.

361
00:48:39,339 --> 00:48:41,378
No, they don't.

362
00:48:45,594 --> 00:48:47,634
Ah, shut up and go to sleep,
you little bum.

363
00:48:48,723 --> 00:48:50,762
I'm not a bum.

364
00:48:50,849 --> 00:48:52,842
No, you're the underpants.

365
00:49:40,851 --> 00:49:42,891
# I heard
it also rained in Tallahassee

366
00:49:43,978 --> 00:49:46,017
# But not a drop fell
on little old me

367
00:49:48,149 --> 00:49:50,187
# 'Cause I was in shu-shu-shu

368
00:49:50,275 --> 00:49:52,268
# Shu-shu-shu

369
00:49:52,361 --> 00:49:54,353
# Shu-shu-shu-shu-shu-shu

370
00:49:55,446 --> 00:49:57,486
# Sugar Town

371
00:50:00,659 --> 00:50:02,699
# If I had a million dollars or ten

372
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:06,869
# I'd give it to you, world,
and then

373
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,039
# You'd go away
and let me spend my life

374
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:15,209
# In shu-shu-shu

375
00:50:15,297 --> 00:50:17,289
# Shu-shu-shu

376
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:19,374
# Shu-shu-shu-shu-shu-shu
Sugar Town. #

377
00:50:50,703 --> 00:50:52,743
What the fuck?

378
00:50:53,831 --> 00:50:55,869
What you doin'? Hey?

379
00:50:55,957 --> 00:50:57,949
- Ugh!
- What's all this?

380
00:50:59,044 --> 00:51:01,082
Aaagh! Aaagh! Aaagh!

381
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:03,163
Aaagh! Aaaagh!

382
00:51:07,383 --> 00:51:09,423
Get that shit off!

383
00:51:10,511 --> 00:51:12,551
Don't you fuckin' kick me!

384
00:51:13,639 --> 00:51:15,679
Aaagh! Aaagh!

385
00:51:20,937 --> 00:51:22,976
Fuckin' little girl!

386
00:51:23,063 --> 00:51:25,056
Aaagh! Aaagh! Ow!

387
00:51:28,235 --> 00:51:30,275
Aaagh! Aaagh!

388
00:51:33,448 --> 00:51:35,488
Go and wash that fuckin' shit
off your face!

389
00:52:17,235 --> 00:52:18,730
Give us a look.

390
00:52:18,821 --> 00:52:20,315
Oh, there's some cauliflowers.

391
00:53:36,471 --> 00:53:38,510
Winner! And the crowd goes wild.

392
00:54:07,748 --> 00:54:09,787
You didn't do much of a job
washing your face.

393
00:54:09,874 --> 00:54:11,867
You still look like a girl.

394
00:54:23,386 --> 00:54:25,426
You want some breakfast?

395
00:54:25,513 --> 00:54:27,505
We've got all that good stuff.

396
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:35,852
Come on, you must be hungry.

397
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:43,149
My face hurts.

398
00:55:05,089 --> 00:55:06,584
Ow! Ow!

399
00:55:06,674 --> 00:55:08,168
Hey, keep still.

400
00:55:23,855 --> 00:55:25,894
You nick that vest?

401
00:55:28,026 --> 00:55:30,066
It's magic protection.

402
00:55:36,367 --> 00:55:38,405
Ow.

403
00:56:13,899 --> 00:56:15,937
How did you get those scars?

404
00:56:18,069 --> 00:56:20,107
Well, all sorts of shit
goes on in prison, mate.

405
00:56:21,196 --> 00:56:23,236
Like what?

406
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:28,449
Oh, well, I was young - easy prey.

407
00:56:33,707 --> 00:56:35,747
People take advantage

408
00:56:35,835 --> 00:56:37,827
do bad things to ya.

409
00:56:42,048 --> 00:56:44,087
Know what I mean?

410
00:57:00,814 --> 00:57:02,308
Come on. Come on in.

411
00:57:02,399 --> 00:57:03,893
I can't swim. You know that.

412
00:57:04,985 --> 00:57:07,024
No, you can't swim yet.

413
00:57:08,112 --> 00:57:10,151
Come on.

414
00:57:13,325 --> 00:57:15,364
Hey? It'll be fine, right?

415
00:57:16,452 --> 00:57:17,947
I got ya.

416
00:57:18,037 --> 00:57:19,828
I got ya.

417
00:57:19,913 --> 00:57:21,242
I got ya.

418
00:57:21,332 --> 00:57:23,084
You're not too cold?

419
00:57:23,084 --> 00:57:24,412
- Uh-uh.
- No?

420
00:57:24,502 --> 00:57:25,781
Right. Now, take a deep breath.

421
00:57:27,921 --> 00:57:29,415
Relax, relax. Relax.

422
00:57:29,506 --> 00:57:31,296
- You right?
- Mm.

423
00:57:31,382 --> 00:57:33,256
OK. Put your head back.

424
00:57:33,342 --> 00:57:35,251
Straighten your back. That's it.

425
00:57:35,344 --> 00:57:37,253
Righto. Put your arms out wide.

426
00:57:38,347 --> 00:57:40,386
Right.

427
00:57:41,473 --> 00:57:43,513
OK.

428
00:57:43,601 --> 00:57:45,095
N ow

429
00:57:45,186 --> 00:57:46,928
I'm gonna let you go.

430
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:48,894
Relax.

431
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:50,807
You right? You're right.

432
00:57:55,069 --> 00:57:57,062
You're right, you're right,
you're right. I've got ya. I've got ya.

433
00:57:57,154 --> 00:57:59,146
I've got ya. Try again.

434
00:58:01,284 --> 00:58:02,777
OK.

435
00:58:02,868 --> 00:58:04,658
Relax.

436
00:58:04,744 --> 00:58:06,452
Keep your back straight.

437
00:58:07,539 --> 00:58:09,578
There you go.

438
00:58:09,665 --> 00:58:11,658
There you go. See?

439
00:58:12,751 --> 00:58:14,791
Eh?

440
00:58:14,878 --> 00:58:16,871
Now, you get into trouble, you can
always roll onto your back and float.

441
00:58:38,816 --> 00:58:40,855
Shit.

442
00:58:40,943 --> 00:58:42,935
Come on, mate.

443
00:59:30,944 --> 00:59:32,983
Fuckin' black bastards
must have dobbed us in.

444
01:00:27,785 --> 01:00:29,279
Fuck!

445
01:00:36,626 --> 01:00:38,665
Fuck.

446
01:00:40,796 --> 01:00:42,835
You stay there.

447
01:00:42,923 --> 01:00:44,916
Shit!

448
01:00:48,094 --> 01:00:50,134
Are we bogged?

449
01:01:02,689 --> 01:01:04,729
Go see if you can find us some water.

450
01:02:39,649 --> 01:02:41,688
Gross.

451
01:02:41,775 --> 01:02:43,768
Nah, it's alright.

452
01:02:46,947 --> 01:02:48,986
What are we gonna eat?

453
01:02:54,245 --> 01:02:56,285
We could boil up those sheep's bones.

454
01:02:59,457 --> 01:03:01,497
Maybe catch a dingo.

455
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:10,880
We can get the car out
in the morning.

456
01:03:11,969 --> 01:03:14,008
Hey?

457
01:03:26,564 --> 01:03:28,604
Can you eat a dog?

458
01:03:34,905 --> 01:03:36,944
- How about that?
- Yep! A bit more!

459
01:03:40,117 --> 01:03:42,157
Is that good enough?

460
01:03:42,244 --> 01:03:44,237
Yeah.

461
01:03:46,372 --> 01:03:48,412
- Ah!
- Yes!

462
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:50,493
Good driving!

463
01:04:18,692 --> 01:04:20,732
It's about 300 or 400 k's around...

464
01:04:22,863 --> 01:04:24,902
...or 30 across,
then there's a roadhouse.

465
01:04:27,033 --> 01:04:29,072
How do you know?

466
01:04:29,159 --> 01:04:31,153
I've been here before.

467
01:04:33,373 --> 01:04:35,329
It's a lake.

468
01:04:36,416 --> 01:04:38,456
Yeah, sorta.

469
01:05:10,821 --> 01:05:12,860
- Where'd you learn to count?
- Same place as you.

470
01:05:13,949 --> 01:05:15,989
Mate, 14 and 8 makes 22,
not fuckin' 21.

471
01:05:20,204 --> 01:05:21,699
My game.

472
01:05:21,789 --> 01:05:23,282
Finish up, mate.

473
01:05:24,374 --> 01:05:26,414
I'm off for a quick drink.

474
01:05:26,501 --> 01:05:28,494
- See you in the morning.
- See you, Dad.

475
01:06:30,056 --> 01:06:32,096
DAD: What you doin', eh?

476
01:06:33,184 --> 01:06:35,222
- Eh?!

477
01:06:38,397 --> 01:06:40,436
You fuckin' dog!

478
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:49,820
Dad?

479
01:06:55,079 --> 01:06:57,117
You didn't have to.

480
01:06:58,205 --> 01:07:00,245
Didn't have to what?

481
01:07:01,333 --> 01:07:03,372
Hurt Max.

482
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:05,453
He wasn't hurting me.
He was just lonely.

483
01:07:08,631 --> 01:07:10,671
Hey, don't you say that,
you little poofter.

484
01:07:15,929 --> 01:07:17,968
Yeah, well, it doesn't matter now
anyway, 'cause he's dead.

485
01:07:19,057 --> 01:07:21,096
What?

486
01:07:21,184 --> 01:07:23,175
He's fuckin' dead. Right? He's dead.

487
01:07:23,268 --> 01:07:25,261
Dead.

488
01:07:43,036 --> 01:07:45,074
- Oi!

489
01:07:47,207 --> 01:07:49,246
Chook!

490
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:52,373
I hate you!

491
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:54,453
Fuckin' cut that out!

492
01:07:57,632 --> 01:07:59,671
Listen, mate. Fuck it.

493
01:07:59,759 --> 01:08:01,751
He was still breathing
when we left, yeah?

494
01:08:01,843 --> 01:08:03,883
You saw me check on him.

495
01:08:03,971 --> 01:08:05,963
I hate you.

496
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:10,098
Mate, there are just some things
you're too young to understand.

497
01:08:12,227 --> 01:08:14,267
I'm supposed to protect ya.

498
01:08:14,355 --> 01:08:16,348
He was like a proper dad.
He looked after me, not like you!

499
01:08:22,653 --> 01:08:24,148
You f...

500
01:08:24,238 --> 01:08:25,732
Fuck!

501
01:08:32,037 --> 01:08:34,076
Proper dad?

502
01:08:35,749 --> 01:08:37,207
I'll show you a fuckin' proper dad.

503
01:08:48,718 --> 01:08:50,756
Dad!

504
01:08:51,845 --> 01:08:53,885
Dad!

505
01:09:13,739 --> 01:09:15,779
Dad!

506
01:09:15,866 --> 01:09:17,858
Dad!

507
01:10:59,039 --> 01:11:01,077
Hey, get in.

508
01:11:07,379 --> 01:11:09,419
Alright, I'm sorry, yeah?
But you needed to learn a lesson.

509
01:11:27,188 --> 01:11:29,227
Come on, mate.

510
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:39,079
Hey.

511
01:12:40,168 --> 01:12:41,662
You right there?

512
01:12:41,752 --> 01:12:43,246
Out of there, boy.

513
01:12:50,593 --> 01:12:52,633
You deaf?

514
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:54,712
Hey?

515
01:12:56,849 --> 01:12:58,888
Hey, behave yourself.

516
01:13:01,019 --> 01:13:03,058
You cheeky little shit.

517
01:13:05,188 --> 01:13:07,228
- Wait on.
- You wanna take care.

518
01:13:10,402 --> 01:13:12,441
Fuck!

519
01:13:35,424 --> 01:13:37,463
Get in the car.

520
01:14:10,870 --> 01:14:12,910
What the fuck are you doing, mate?

521
01:14:16,084 --> 01:14:18,123
Eh?

522
01:16:37,873 --> 01:16:39,912
And just squeeze the trigger.

523
01:16:41,001 --> 01:16:43,040
- Shot! Up and back.

524
01:16:44,128 --> 01:16:46,168
Up and back.

525
01:17:02,937 --> 01:17:04,928
I camped here with your mum...

526
01:17:06,023 --> 01:17:08,062
...just after we met.

527
01:17:15,405 --> 01:17:17,444
We stole a Monaro
and dumped it up in Queensland.

528
01:17:22,703 --> 01:17:24,743
This was the key.

529
01:17:24,830 --> 01:17:26,822
She gave it to me

530
01:17:27,916 --> 01:17:29,956
to remember the fun we'd had.

531
01:17:30,044 --> 01:17:32,035
Here.

532
01:17:38,342 --> 01:17:40,381
She was alright, you know, your mum.

533
01:17:42,512 --> 01:17:44,551
It was like a...
like a travelling circus sometimes.

534
01:17:56,065 --> 01:17:58,105
You might have even been made here.

535
01:17:59,193 --> 01:18:01,233
Eh? Who knows?

536
01:18:06,492 --> 01:18:08,531
Why don't you go see
if you can bag us some dinner, eh?

537
01:21:27,707 --> 01:21:29,746
Did you get a rabbit?

538
01:21:40,218 --> 01:21:42,257
I wouldn't mind some of that.

539
01:22:06,282 --> 01:22:08,320
This is better than a TV.

540
01:22:10,452 --> 01:22:12,492
You can make up your own program.

541
01:22:15,665 --> 01:22:17,704
Dad?

542
01:22:18,793 --> 01:22:20,832
Why'd you go to jail?

543
01:22:22,963 --> 01:22:25,002
Oh, what the last time?

544
01:22:25,089 --> 01:22:27,082
Oh, that was just a couple of months.
That was just a sleep.

545
01:22:29,219 --> 01:22:31,257
You know, me and...

546
01:22:36,516 --> 01:22:38,556
Me and Max got pulled over
in a stolen car

547
01:22:40,687 --> 01:22:42,726
and the cop started hammering us
so I laid into him.

548
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:53,652
Yeah, but I get caught for this one,
I do... I don't know, 15 years.

549
01:22:55,283 --> 01:22:57,322
10 minimum.

550
01:22:58,410 --> 01:23:00,449
If you told them
you didn't mean to kill Max,

551
01:23:02,580 --> 01:23:04,619
it was just an accident...

552
01:23:15,091 --> 01:23:17,131
What's gonna happen to us?

553
01:23:20,304 --> 01:23:22,344
Hey, we'll be fine.

554
01:23:28,645 --> 01:23:30,684
But what if we're not?

555
01:23:32,815 --> 01:23:34,855
Do you trust me?

556
01:23:48,454 --> 01:23:50,493
What you doin'?

557
01:23:53,667 --> 01:23:55,706
Getting some wood.

558
01:23:55,794 --> 01:23:57,786
Ah, you're getting to be
quite the little bushie now.

559
01:24:02,007 --> 01:24:04,046
You can look after yourself.

560
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:32,665
Fuck.

561
01:25:37,923 --> 01:25:39,962
Jesus.

562
01:25:54,604 --> 01:25:56,643
Chook?

563
01:26:17,541 --> 01:26:19,580
Chook?

564
01:26:32,136 --> 01:26:34,176
Chook?

565
01:26:38,393 --> 01:26:40,431
Hey, Chook, what are you doin'?

566
01:26:45,689 --> 01:26:47,729
Chook?!

567
01:26:51,946 --> 01:26:53,985
Hey, we gotta leave, mate.

568
01:26:56,116 --> 01:26:58,155
Oh, fuck!

569
01:27:00,286 --> 01:27:02,325
You stupid little bugger!

570
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:07,538
What do you think you're doin'?

571
01:27:14,882 --> 01:27:16,921
Aagh!

572
01:27:21,138 --> 01:27:23,178
Ah, fuck!

573
01:27:24,265 --> 01:27:26,304
Oh!

574
01:27:27,393 --> 01:27:29,432
Oh!

575
01:27:29,519 --> 01:27:31,512
Chook!

576
01:27:31,605 --> 01:27:33,598
Hey, give us a hand.
I've busted my fuckin' ankle!

577
01:27:43,032 --> 01:27:45,070
Fuck.

578
01:27:49,287 --> 01:27:51,325
Chook!

579
01:27:51,413 --> 01:27:53,406
Chook, what the fuck are you doing?

580
01:28:00,755 --> 01:28:02,794
Chook!

581
01:28:02,881 --> 01:28:04,874
What the fuck are you doing?!

582
01:28:09,095 --> 01:28:11,135
Oh, fuck!

583
01:28:27,862 --> 01:28:29,901
I know you can hear me.

584
01:28:36,202 --> 01:28:38,241
Look, mate, whatever
I've done, I'm sorry.

585
01:28:46,628 --> 01:28:48,668
Come on, mate, I'm your dad!

586
01:28:53,926 --> 01:28:55,964
Chook!

587
01:29:03,309 --> 01:29:05,348
Fuck.

588
01:30:43,396 --> 01:30:45,435
Give us the rifle.

589
01:30:51,736 --> 01:30:53,775
Give us the rifle, mate.

590
01:30:56,949 --> 01:30:58,989
Oh, come on, will you?!

591
01:31:04,247 --> 01:31:06,286
OK, it's alright,
it's alright. It's OK.

592
01:31:07,374 --> 01:31:09,414
I've got a plan.
Come over here and I'll tell ya.

593
01:31:11,544 --> 01:31:13,584
Come on, mate.

594
01:31:15,716 --> 01:31:17,755
It's gonna be fine.

595
01:31:18,843 --> 01:31:20,882
Come on.

596
01:31:32,396 --> 01:31:34,435
Now, here's what we do.

597
01:31:36,566 --> 01:31:38,605
What I need is
for you to go over there

598
01:31:39,694 --> 01:31:41,734
and you tell 'em...

599
01:31:41,821 --> 01:31:43,814
...you tell 'em you want to
talk to Maryanne.

600
01:31:44,907 --> 01:31:47,991
I want to stay with you.

601
01:31:48,076 --> 01:31:51,112
No, mate. No, no. I need you
to do this exactly how I tell ya.

602
01:31:54,290 --> 01:31:56,329
Yeah? Can you do that for me?

603
01:31:58,461 --> 01:32:00,500
Yeah, well, that's good.

604
01:32:04,716 --> 01:32:06,755
I did it.

605
01:32:07,843 --> 01:32:09,883
You did what, mate?

606
01:32:10,972 --> 01:32:13,010
I told the cops we're here.

607
01:32:17,226 --> 01:32:19,266
Oh.

608
01:32:32,864 --> 01:32:34,904
Well, that's OK.

609
01:32:37,035 --> 01:32:39,074
That's fine.

610
01:32:43,292 --> 01:32:45,330
You done the right thing.

611
01:32:50,588 --> 01:32:52,628
Come here, mate.

612
01:32:57,887 --> 01:32:59,381
I love you.

613
01:32:59,472 --> 01:33:01,262
I love you, Dad.

614
01:33:01,348 --> 01:33:03,056
Yeah?

615
01:33:39,590 --> 01:33:41,629
Yeah, off you go, eh?

616
01:33:45,845 --> 01:33:47,885
You got your magic vest on.

617
01:33:50,015 --> 01:33:51,509
Yeah.

618
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:53,095
Well, you'll be right, then.
