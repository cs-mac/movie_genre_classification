00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:36,954
<i>This movie is based on true events.</i>

2
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:55,643
Juan, wake up,Juan, we're here.

3
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:56,941
Come on.

4
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,378
- What is it?
- l have to pee.

5
00:02:01,554 --> 00:02:03,419
l told you to go before leaving.

6
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,251
- What is it, kiddo?
- We're almost there.

7
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:11,293
l'm out of cigarettes,
be right back.

8
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,330
Hurry, Mom! Quick!

9
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:24,870
Cristina!

10
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,711
The bastards!

11
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:36,987
Fuckers!

12
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:39,786
Horacio!

13
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:51,626
They hit me on the leg!

14
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:54,070
Horacio, what happened?

15
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:56,005
- Are you alright?
- l'm fine.

16
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:59,670
You okay, kiddo?
Go with him. Take him!

17
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,814
lt's okay, honey.
Daddy's alright.

18
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,708
Horacio, what'll we do?

19
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,910
Let's get outta here!

20
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,349
<i>After the death of President Perón.</i>

21
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:17,223
<i>paramilitary groups started</i>

22
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,696
<i>persecuting and murdering</i>
<i>social activists and revolutionaries.</i>

23
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:27,833
<i>The military seized power.</i>

24
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:32,137
<i>unleashing the most violent repression</i>
<i>in Argentina's history.</i>

25
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:37,044
<i>Exiled in Cuba.</i>

26
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,209
<i>the revolutionary leaders</i>
<i>of Montoneros</i>

27
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:44,083
<i>initiate</i>
<i>the "Counterstrike Operation."</i>

28
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:50,888
<i>Some activists go home</i>
<i>with their children.</i>

29
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:55,759
Hello, hello, 1, 2, 3, 4, testing.

30
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,644
Ready. Shall we?

31
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:12,851
Okay.

32
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:18,054
Hey, handsome.

33
00:04:19,692 --> 00:04:22,889
lt's funny l'm taping this
rather than saying it to you.

34
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:26,861
But hey, it's so
that you can listen to us

35
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:30,260
as many times as you want
till we meet again.

36
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,669
Today we begin our journey
back to Argentina,

37
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:37,241
but we'll take different roads,

38
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,078
which means
we'll be separated for a while.

39
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,638
Here's Dad.

40
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:44,216
Go on.

41
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:48,813
Hey, kiddo.

42
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:50,614
Here l am.

43
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:56,658
We'll be separated for a while,
so l'll miss you like crazy.

44
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:59,630
But the good thing is,
we're going back.

45
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:02,426
And that
we're doing this because...

46
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:07,333
because we think it's the right time
to carry on fighting.

47
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:12,841
We're going back separately.

48
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:17,279
You and Vicky go
with Carmen and Gregorio.

49
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:21,016
They'll be your parents.

50
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,622
You'll be going through Brazil.

51
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:29,954
lf anybody asks a question, you say:
"l don't speak Spanish."

52
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,289
<i>Eu no falo español.</i>

53
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,589
Good.

54
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:10,491
Move it!

55
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,522
<i>Kiddo.</i>

56
00:06:31,624 --> 00:06:35,788
<i>remember how I told you</i>
<i>all about when El Che left Cuba?</i>

57
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:40,089
<i>You did those drawings.</i>
<i>Amazing. I still have them.</i>

58
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:45,936
<i>Now it's your turn</i>
<i>to do as he did.</i>

59
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,006
<i>Remember that time</i>
<i>he went to Congo.</i>

60
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:54,572
<i>dressed as a business man.</i>
<i>suit, tie and all?</i>

61
00:06:55,948 --> 00:06:57,415
<i>With a Uruguayan passport</i>

62
00:06:57,617 --> 00:07:00,711
<i>under the name</i>
<i>"Ramón Benitez Fernández."</i>

63
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,115
<i>That's how nobody recognized him.</i>

64
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:07,486
<i>And in Bolivia he went by the name</i>
<i>"Adolfo Mena González"</i>

65
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,757
<i>and also wore a suit.</i>

66
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:14,393
<i>And you laughed that he shaved</i>
<i>his head as if he had gone bald.</i>

67
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,692
<i>And those glasses...</i>

68
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:19,702
<i>But your favorite detail</i>
<i>was the hat he wore...</i>

69
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,005
<i>So, handsome.</i>

70
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,837
<i>this is your mission.</i>

71
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:27,242
<i>You've already chosen a name.</i>
<i>You're no longer Juan.</i>

72
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,710
<i>From now on you're...</i>

73
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:31,144
Ernesto.

74
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:38,854
So, what about the World Cup?

75
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,419
We don't discuss soccer,

76
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,596
but congratulations
on winning the Cup.

77
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:47,689
World champions -
gotta give it to us, huh?

78
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,661
Welcome to our country.

79
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:04,774
l'll go make a call
across the street.

80
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,619
Meet you at the bar.

81
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:13,317
Stay here. We'll be right back.

82
00:08:33,546 --> 00:08:34,706
What's up, kiddo?

83
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:35,906
Uncle!

84
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,212
- Why're you here?
- Cool it.

85
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:40,645
We don't want to attract a crowd!

86
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:44,215
- What're you doing 'ere?
- "Doing 'ere?"

87
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:47,019
That Cuban accent will get us killed!

88
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,089
Pretend we saw each other yesterday.

89
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,924
Now we get up,

90
00:08:51,397 --> 00:08:54,127
calmly walk over there
and continue the trip.

91
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,324
Carmen and Gregorio?

92
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:58,699
Carmen and Gregorio are gone.
You're with me now.

93
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:08,805
- How awesome is this van?
- Oi, awesome van.

94
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:11,381
What do you mean
"oi", awesome van?

95
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:13,713
We say "hey" here.

96
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:47,585
Stay calm. Don't talk.

97
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,584
l'll do the talking.

98
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:53,951
- Documents.
- Hello, officer.

99
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:08,669
<i>Juan, you have to repeat it</i>
<i>over and over.</i>

100
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:12,108
<i>You can't hesitate. remember.</i>

101
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:16,008
<i>You're no longerJuan.</i>
<i>you're Ernesto.</i>

102
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,477
Kiddo!

103
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:04,353
CLANDESTINE CHILDHOOD

104
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:42,393
Mom?

105
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:44,828
Dad?

106
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:02,978
Morning, kiddo!

107
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:05,984
Put some shoes on,
you'll freeze.

108
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:09,321
Morning, handsome!
Had a good night's rest?

109
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:12,220
Boy, did l miss you!

110
00:12:13,165 --> 00:12:15,861
- Okay...
- Don't you love me anymore?

111
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,734
- Chilly, huh?
- We miss the tropical warmth.

112
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:26,873
- So what's this place?
- The shed.

113
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,910
Here we pack the peanuts,
hang our things, everything.

114
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,143
Not this, You know better.

115
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,749
Good, aren't they?

116
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:41,158
Somebody left
the fridge open outside!

117
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:46,230
- l already said that.
- Who do we have here? Fidel Castro?

118
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,824
That accent again!

119
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:54,029
Wait.

120
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:56,302
Actually we come from Córdoba.

121
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:59,603
So you want him
to do the Córdobes sing-song?

122
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:02,471
Too hard.
Try the Buenos Aires accent.

123
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:06,117
- Our papers say we're from Córdoba.
- The kids won't notice.

124
00:13:06,318 --> 00:13:07,785
lt's easier for him.

125
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:09,852
Give it a shot,
see what you got.

126
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:13,518
Practice, kiddo!

127
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:17,286

Look.

140
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,288
This is your hiding place.

141
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:54,532
lf anything happens, you come here.
lt opens like this.

142
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:57,796
Come on in.

lt opens here

145
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,138
and closes here.

146
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,331
Neat!

147
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:10,879
Awesome!

148
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:38,400
Good morning.
Stand up!

149
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:43,914
Good morning, Headmistress.

Sit down.

151
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:50,019
Children...

152
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:54,249
l want you to meet
your new classmate, Ernesto.

153
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:57,425
He's from Córdoba
and lives in our neighborhood.

154
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,361
Ernesto, this is Zulma,
your new teacher.

155
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,591
Hello, Ernesto,
nice to meet you.  Welcome.

156
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:07,562
- Cat got your tongue?
- Hello.

157
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:10,942
Now go and sit next to Maxi.

158
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,768
Will you make room for him?

159
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:17,307
Good day.

160
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,542
Good day, Zulma.

161

You may sit now.

163
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,596
Get your things out, Ernesto.

164
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:35,963
So, we've covered Columbus,
his arrival in America.

165
00:15:36,969 --> 00:15:42,271
Now, what was the most important thing
the Spaniards brought?

166
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:46,770
Yes, Esteban.

167
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,409
The Spaniards brought Spanish.

168
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,784
That wasn't the most important thing.

169
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:56,079
- Anybody? Yes...
- Culture.

170
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:58,349
- Well done!
- The Catholic religion.

171
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,949
Culture, our Catholic religion...
Civilization.

172
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,495
The Spaniards brought civilization.

173
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,074
Hand me that.

174
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,800
And why is ours missing the sun?

175
00:16:20,212 --> 00:16:21,804
Because we use the original one,

176
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:24,642
created by Belgrano,
just blue and white.

177
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,344
- Hand me that.
- Belgrano? Who's he?

178
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,588
He's the creator
of the Argentine flag, kiddo.

179
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:36,419
And he made it based on the rosette.
Remember that?

180
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:39,620
The blue and white thing
we wear on national holidays?

181
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,264
Yeah, the little circle.

182
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:43,359
Hand me the last one.

183
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:46,438
But the flag with the sun
was later chosen

184
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:49,666
as the war flag
and that's the one that stuck.

185
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,333
Hey!

186
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:55,001
What are you up to, kiddo?
Don't touch, remember?

187
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:24,409
Come in.

188
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:46,027
- Can they remove the blindfolds?
- No, the blinds first. Beto...

189
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:58,973
You can take off the blindfolds.

190
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:14,123
- Good to see you.
- This way.

191
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:15,921
Form a line, please.

192
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:23,992
Attention!

193
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,837
Eyes on compañero Daniel.

194
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:31,867
At ease!

195
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:38,213
Right, compañeros, from now
until this meeting is over,

196
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:41,045
the house and group
are under my command.

197
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,452
On this day, we assemble

198
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:47,352
the Special Agitation Troops,
Platoons 1 and 2.

199
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,790
Compañera Charo
will hand out your defense tools.

200
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:56,058
Signal interference tools
will follow presently.

201
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,059
Charo...

202
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,442
Compañero Pedro,
here are your gun, magazine,

203
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:11,115
chamber empty of ammo.

204
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,884
Compañera Lucía,
here are your gun...

205
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:19,818
Easy...

206
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,189
Before we start the instruction...

207
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,822
Beto.

208
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:34,129
A moment for our compañeros
fallen in the revolutionary fight.

209
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:38,138
- Compañero Marcos.
- Here!

210
00:19:38,644 --> 00:19:41,112
- Compañero Gregorio.
- Here!

211
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,938
- Till victory.
- Always.

212
00:19:43,148 --> 00:19:45,639
- Perón or death!
- Long live our homeland!

213
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:13,543
<i>You suffer because I'm pushed away</i>

214
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:16,714
<i>By a hope of tomorrow</i>

215
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,711
<i>That I look painstakingly</i>

216
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:22,910
<i>Only for you</i>

217
00:20:24,423 --> 00:20:26,948
<i>A string of stars</i>

218
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,857
<i>Warmly breaking</i>

219
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:33,096
<i>Your beautiful eyes</i>

220
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:37,032
<i>Mourning me thus</i>

221
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:42,729
<i>Dreams of youth</i>
<i>that die in your good-bye</i>

222
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:48,236
<i>Timid remembrance that I will miss</i>

223
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:54,075
<i>Songs of hope that I kindled</i>

224
00:20:55,854 --> 00:21:00,655
<i>Caressing your soul in my solitude</i>

225
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:05,724
<i>My poor heart doesn't think straight</i>

226
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:11,468
<i>And when it gets pushed away from you</i>

227
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:16,005
<i>It can only weep</i>

228
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:19,171
<i>It can only moan</i>

229
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:24,306
<i>Bleeds to death in your good-bye</i>

230
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,948
lt's one of those complex decisions,

231
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:35,254
but that's why we're here,
to raise awareness, reinforce our ideas.

232
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:38,492
Justice, justice for all!

233
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:41,178
- My turn...
- Forget it.

234
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:43,650
- Why?
- You can't see.

235
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:48,818
- Check Natalia out.
- Get outta here!

236
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,498
There's some serious eye candy.

237
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:57,128
- Which one?
- Not that one, she's ugly!

238
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:00,668
- With the blue stripes?
- No, the red one.

239
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:04,740
That one in blue, stretching.

240
00:24:04,843 --> 00:24:06,435
Yeah, some pair of legs!

241
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:10,743
You don't know
the first thing about legs.

242
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:13,079
Oh, shut up!
At least l got juice.

243
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:21,591
- Well done, Natalia!
- Quit it!

244
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,495
Feli, look,
your sister's up next.

245
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,832
Hope she falls,
after what she did to me.

246
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:33,871
- She's always up to something!
- She's impossible.

247
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:36,099
She's hot.
Can't be that bad...

248
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,935
She's horrible!
You're crazy!

249
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:41,137
- l'd totally screw her.
- What?

250
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:42,440
You prick!

251
00:25:50,148 --> 00:25:51,809
Córdoba, are you on the moon?

252
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,380
Somebody else
has a crush on your sister.

253
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:55,814
Me? Not at all.

254
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:57,283
"Me", Córdoba!

255
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:01,916
You ruined this picture.

256
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,855
First time in front of a camera?

257
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,030
You could at least smile!

258
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,486
Mom...

259
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:49,928
l have a camping trip.

260
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:51,492
When?

261
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:53,170
October 12th.

262
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:57,367
lt's just one night.

263
00:27:58,877 --> 00:28:00,310
l suppose it's alright.

264
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,653
What is it?

265
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,115
Anything else?

266
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:15,383
l wanted to ask you something.

267
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:22,990
How did you know that dad was...

268
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,334
Well, not that...

269
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:29,407
that you liked him.

270
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:32,873
l dunno.

271
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:36,141
You get a feeling in your tummy like...

272
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:37,712
just different.

273
00:28:39,184 --> 00:28:41,345
- Sounds strange.
- lt is strange.

274
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:46,354
A mutual friend threw a party
and that's how l met him.

275
00:28:47,358 --> 00:28:48,950
lt was in a basement.

276
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,721
When he showed up,

277
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:54,759
he looked at me,

278
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,732
gave me a big smile,

279
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:02,829
and l just fell for him.

280
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:06,377
So, it was love at first sight.

281
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:07,604
You could say that.

282
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,713
At least for me.
Your dad played hard to get.

283
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:15,385
lt took two months to win him over.

284
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:18,883
We became friends,
he talked to me.

285
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,388
l loved his eyes,

286
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,452
his way of putting things,

287
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:28,193
so earnestly.

288
00:29:30,902 --> 00:29:32,460
And those glasses he wore!

289
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:43,679
- What's your story?
- What?

290
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,842
- What are you up to?
- With what?

291
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,579
- Don't beat about the bush.
- There's nobody.

292
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:50,779
Seriously.

293
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,984
l just wanted to know...

294
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:54,888
how it felt.

295
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,686
You fancy a classmate.

296
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:03,365
You fancy a classmate.

297
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:06,835
l could kill the little brat.
You're mine, all mine!

298
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,837
Mine, mine!

299
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:12,599
Who is it? Who is it?

300
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:15,835
Nobody.

301
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:17,782
Nobody.

302
00:30:30,562 --> 00:30:31,722
What happened?

303
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:37,795
lt was a set-up.

304
00:30:39,304 --> 00:30:40,430
Fuck!

305
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:43,800
- Are you alone?
- Yes, l am.

306
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:48,870
- What happened?
- lt was a trap.

307
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:51,339
Gallego, the son of a bitch!

308
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:54,184
Are you alright?

309
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,844
- Let me see.
- What is it, Beto?

310
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:58,547
- Let me see.
- Stop it!

311
00:30:58,656 --> 00:30:59,680
Let me see.

312
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:03,484
Tell me everything, dammit!

313
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,765
l got there 10 minutes early
to scout the place.

314
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,892
lt looked OK. At the arranged time,

315
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:12,601
l turn the corner.

316
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:15,767
The guy's sitting on the sidewalk.

317
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,907
He gets up,

318
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:18,771
pretends to drop his wallet...

319
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,139
Son of a bitch!

320
00:31:20,912 --> 00:31:22,880
He stoops to pick it up...

321
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:26,843
He glances sideways.

322
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:31,647
l follow his gaze
and these two guys see me staring.

323
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:33,151
Fuckers!

324
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:37,317
So l ran away,
firing three shots,

325
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:41,159
down into the tube station
and hid in a bathroom.

326
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:44,597
What's going on, Daniel?

327
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:48,232
We've been snitched on.
What do l know?

328
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:51,575
Shit!

329
00:32:05,456 --> 00:32:07,048
Shit!

330
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:09,149
- Sure you were alone?
- Yes!

331
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:10,619
Hide, Juan!

332
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,069
You checked, Beto?

333
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,296
Yes, l checked!

334
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:42,783
Easy there, Vicky.

335
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,953
Easy.

336
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:14,150
Hush, please.

337
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:32,036
Here, baby.

338
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:37,939
Everything alright?

339
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,173
lt was nothing, nothing.

340
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:58,000
Hi.

341
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,499
- l saw you yesterday.
- You did?

342
00:34:04,442 --> 00:34:07,639
- Real good, that thing you do.
- Thank you.

343
00:34:12,183 --> 00:34:13,548
l'm Ernesto.

344
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,344
Yes, l know.

345
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:19,049
l'm María.

346
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:20,958
Yes, l know.

347
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:23,951
Arms' length!

348
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,759
Ernesto, as you're new,
you have the honor of raising the flag.

349
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:36,130
l can't.

350
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:41,408
- What do you mean?
- lt's just l don't want to.

351
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:43,971
Don't be shy, come on.

352
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:47,447
- l'm not going.
- Ma'am, can l go?

353
00:34:58,162 --> 00:34:59,129
Coward!

354
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:03,096
Didn't they teach patriotism
in your province?

355
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:04,767
Coward!

356
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:09,366
Fight! Fight!

357
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:23,486
l can't figure this out.

358
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:26,690
To fight for not wanting
to raise the flag?

359
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:27,815
First time ever.

360
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:30,254
You see, Ernesto is very shy.

361
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:31,555
He doesn't like crowds.

362
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:33,730
We can't tolerate fighting.

363
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:37,028
But he's adjusting, isn't he?

364
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:39,362
Well, boys, stand up,

365
00:35:39,537 --> 00:35:41,402
and shake hands.

366
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,708
Go on then!
Stand up and shake hands.

367
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:48,438
Just silly squabbles, ma'am.

368
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:49,613
Shake hands.

369
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,647
A man must learn
to forgive certain things.

370
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,511
Shake hands, then.

371
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:57,447
Go on.
Shake hands with your friend.

372
00:35:58,222 --> 00:35:59,189
Go on!

373
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:02,158
There. And don't let this happen again!

374
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:07,358
What's wrong
with the school flag?

375
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:09,733
- What?
- What's wrong with it?

376
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:11,834
- The sun!
- And?

377
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:13,763
"And?"

378
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,735
lt's got the sun on it.
lt's the war flag.

379
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:20,206
The one used by the military.

380
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:23,676
Every school in Argentina
uses this flag.

381
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,674
Yes, well, they shouldn't
have the war flag,

382
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:30,747
but the blue and white one,
created by...

383
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:32,847
- Belgrano.
- Exactly.

384
00:36:33,724 --> 00:36:35,988
l don't see that changing
any time soon,

385
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,788
so it's stupid
to get into a fight over that.

386
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,089
Hang on...

387
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:44,667
What's your name in school?

388
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:49,763
So?

389
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:52,103
Yeah, you're right.

390
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:53,770
Come again?

391
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:55,701
Yeah, you're right.

392
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:57,380
Come again, soldier?

393
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:00,546
You are right, Colonel!

394
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:02,545
That's better.

395
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:04,913
Now go polish!

396
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,754
Plate,

397
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:44,187
knife...

398
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:45,626
Ready?

399
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:47,821
OK, that's enough.

400
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,332
By the way, don't forget

401
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:52,832
to have those authorizations signed

402
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:54,265
or you won't go camping.

403
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:59,534
Can we carry on?

404
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,081
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

405
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:10,010
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

406
00:38:10,655 --> 00:38:13,954
<i>Happy birthday. Ernesto</i>

407
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:17,092
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

408
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:19,492
Way to go, Córdoba!

409
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,302
What happened?

410
00:38:33,177 --> 00:38:34,838
lt's my birthday today.

411
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:37,643
Right, October 7th.

412
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,643
- Did they say anything at school?
- Say?

413
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:45,120
They sang happy birthday and...
there's a party on Saturday.

414
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:46,916
What do you mean, a party?

415
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,854
They were all singing,
even the teacher.

416
00:38:50,061 --> 00:38:53,030
They chanted ''When's the party?''
And l said it.

417
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,027
- Said what?
- Party on Saturday.

418
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:57,359
Dammit!
Couldn't you have said something else?

419
00:38:57,568 --> 00:38:58,865
We're throwing a party!

420
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,697
Party, party!

421
00:39:00,905 --> 00:39:02,566
lt's OK.
lt's only a party.

422
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:05,037
With everything that's going on!

423
00:39:05,242 --> 00:39:06,675
l don't want presents.

424
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:09,478
That's not the point, honey.

425
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:11,672
We're not in a party mood now.

426
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:13,213
Don't worry, sis-in-law.

427
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:16,250
Here's what l'll do: l'll make a piñata.

428
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,549
A shit-loaded piñata?

429
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:21,481
No shit.
Better fill it with trinkets!

430
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:23,650
- And the cake?
- l'll bake it.

431
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:25,490
Why not dress up like a clown?

432
00:39:48,819 --> 00:39:50,446
- Hi.
- Hi.

433
00:39:51,088 --> 00:39:52,988
- For you, troll!
- No.

434
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:56,119
- l wanted a word with you.
- Me?

435
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:59,196
- Today's my birthday.
- So l heard.

436
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:00,228
Who told you?

437
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:02,461
- Wassup, Córdoba?
- This troll.

438
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:05,157
- Shut up, stupid!
- Go clean up.

439
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:07,999
Hey, what's up?
Get lost, will you?

440
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,204
No, wait, don't go.

441
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:13,269
l came to confirm my party.

442
00:40:13,477 --> 00:40:15,411
You already did in school.

443
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:18,280
- But l came to invite her.
- Her? What for?

444
00:40:18,382 --> 00:40:20,111
- She said she wasn't going.
- l didn't.

445
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:23,013
- You said it was a rug rats party.
- lgnore him.

446
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,778
Can l bring a friend?

447
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:26,081
Yeah, sure.

448
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:28,349
Thanks.

449
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:29,991
Thanks for the invitation.

450
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,319
Bye, María.

451
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:37,926
"Bye, María."
What bit you, Córdoba?

452
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:40,263
Great!

453
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:05,522
Where the fuck's your uncle?

454
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:14,367
Wake up!
Where's your uncle?

455
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:17,337
He went to get
my present in the van.

456
00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:20,509
Listen, kiddo.

457
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:22,770
l'm OK with the party,

458
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:26,475
but you have to help us
keep things under control.

459
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:28,679
Sure, Dad, don't worry.

460
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:31,286
These boxes go in my room,
l'm locking it.

461
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:33,322
Your friends
can't touch the door.

462
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:34,513
OK, Dad.

463
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:37,857
This is important! lt's serious.

464
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:40,723
Finally, dammit!

465
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:57,378
- Where were you, Beto?
- Wait...

466
00:41:57,481 --> 00:41:58,641
l have a surprise.

467
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:00,714
A surprise?

468
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:04,515
A little surprise.
Well, maybe not for you.

469
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:06,747
Alright?

470
00:42:11,629 --> 00:42:13,028
What is this?

471
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,254
Grandma!

472
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:16,026
- Out you get.
- Pumpkin!

473
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:18,863
Careful with the head.
Like before. Sit down.

474
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:20,058
Perfect.

475
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:22,000
- Pumpkin?
- Here.

476
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:26,035
Well done, Amalita.

477
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:30,145
Let me remove the blindfold.

478
00:42:31,515 --> 00:42:32,914
Curtain call...

479
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:41,219
Pumpkin, dearest!

480
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:46,555
How big you've grown, my love!

481
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:48,694
So tall!

482
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,062
Hello there!
How are you?

483
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:54,902
Charo! Come here!

484
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,507
Mom!

485
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:08,246
What're you doing here?

486
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:11,112
Vicky, look, granny!

487
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:14,124
Almost a year old?

488
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:20,997
So, what do you think
of uncle's present?

489
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:27,125
Asshole! Why did you bring
Amalia here? Are you crazy?

490
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:30,331
Calm down, man.
l took every precaution.

491
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:32,509
l don't care
about the precautions.

492
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:35,338
This is totally against
our safety measures!

493
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:38,310
Relax, trust me.
l took every precaution.

494
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:41,416
Listen, how many times
must l repeat myself?

495
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:45,282
Life isn't a big adventure.
You're not a kid anymore!

496
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:49,750
You got it all figured out
and executed, Commander!

497
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:52,521
Lower your voice, it's not funny.

498
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:55,130
Chill out, bro.

499
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:57,690
When will you enjoy this?

500
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:00,429
Enjoy, Beto? Cut the crap.

501
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:02,504
Enjoy, brother.

502
00:44:03,407 --> 00:44:05,967
Enjoy that we're here, together.

503
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:07,810
Appreciate what we're doing.

504
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:10,480
This is no time to be thrilled,
stupid!

505
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:12,842
lt's time to be committed!

506
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:15,848
To grow a pair of balls
and see this through!

507
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:17,987
- Fuck you!
- Commitment, asshole!

508
00:44:18,188 --> 00:44:21,055
l've been pulling my weight
since l can remember!

509
00:44:21,258 --> 00:44:24,955
- Pull it in the right direction!
- What's that?

510
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:28,498
This is also
necessary and important!

511
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,164
Or else why do we do
any of this, huh?

512
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:35,031
This is not the time, Beto!
Not now.

513
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:37,173
On the contrary. lt's now!

514
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:40,810
lf l've learned anything
from all these years of shit,

515
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:43,208
we're building for right now.

516
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:44,904
Here. With this.

517
00:44:45,582 --> 00:44:46,571
Not with this.

518
00:44:46,784 --> 00:44:48,342
You're a hopeless romantic.

519
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:51,946
What're you doing there, kiddo?

520
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:55,418
Come, come, hear us out.

521
00:44:57,394 --> 00:44:58,292
Come here.

522
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:03,265
- Why do you fight so much?
- 'Cause your dad's clueless.

523
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:06,561
Your uncle's a jerk!
That's why.

524
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:08,601
A jerk with his balls
in the right place.

525
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:11,536
ln the right place?
An Argentine macho!

526
00:45:11,742 --> 00:45:14,768
Run along and pamper Amalita.
Run your little show.

527
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:18,436
Oh, so you're pissed off
l brought your mother-in-law.

528
00:45:18,649 --> 00:45:21,243
You could've said that
and spared us the drama.

529
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:24,615
lf it bothers you,
you should've done without a family!

530
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:25,914
Look at me.

531
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:28,519
Free as a bird.

532
00:45:29,093 --> 00:45:30,788
You're an asshole, Beto!

533
00:45:30,994 --> 00:45:34,122
- Big Argentine dick!
- Asshole!

534
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:45,733
OK...

535
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:48,872
Attention, ladies and gentlemen.

536
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,475
Allow me to quote
on this fine evening

537
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:56,781
the great poet
whose name l can't recall

538
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:59,112
and quote his fine verses:

539
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:01,487
"ln and outty, in and outty,

540
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,562
Beto's in the house,
let's party!"

541
00:46:13,137 --> 00:46:14,832
See how l move my hips!

542
00:46:24,014 --> 00:46:26,107
What're you all standing there for?

543
00:46:27,518 --> 00:46:32,649
Compañero Ernesto, do us
the honor of kicking off this party.

544
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:34,989
Yes, sir!

545
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:38,821
A hard choice
between all these fine ladies.

546
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:41,687
Who'll be the lucky one?
One, two, three!

547
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:46,361
Bravo!

548
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:49,170
That was quick.

549
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:52,038
Who's up next? You.

550
00:46:53,877 --> 00:46:55,174
Let me see those hands!

551
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:59,511
A free lady for this gentleman
in need of attention.

552
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:03,111
Don't let me see anyone
without a date.

553
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:04,881
The night breathes love,

554
00:47:05,455 --> 00:47:08,822
matches will be made,
couples are being born.

555
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:11,391
Such style!

556
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:14,363
Look, such style!

557
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,090
Alright!

558
00:48:37,848 --> 00:48:39,577
A drink, Amalita?

559
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:41,580
- Thank you.
- Something strong?

560
00:48:41,785 --> 00:48:44,219
- Definitely.
- Coming right up...

561
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:46,653
- l'll never be a doctor.
- No?

562
00:48:48,725 --> 00:48:50,056
There, she's asleep.

563
00:48:51,662 --> 00:48:54,426
- lsn't she cute?
- A cherub.

564
00:48:54,531 --> 00:48:58,729
You can't imagine
how happy l am to see you.

565
00:48:58,835 --> 00:49:01,303
Strange as it is
to see you here,

566
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:03,873
l'm thrilled you came.

567
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:08,207
Mom...

568
00:49:09,713 --> 00:49:12,273
l know l'm repeating myself...

569
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:16,682
but you can't tell anybody
we're here.

570
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:20,618
Yes, l know
l can't breathe a word.

571
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:24,452
You're not thinking of staying?

572
00:49:26,496 --> 00:49:27,929
l can't say.

573
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:32,467
You can't say, but...

574
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:35,669
Amalita, relax.

575
00:49:36,206 --> 00:49:37,969
Let's just enjoy tonight, OK?

576
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:39,467
- Cheers, Mom!
- Cheers!

577
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:48,875
l'll be right back.

578
00:49:50,287 --> 00:49:51,311
Look, l know...

579
00:49:53,056 --> 00:49:56,048
l'm in no condition to discuss...

580
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:59,822
what you can and can't do,

581
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:02,191
you're well aware,

582
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:07,603
but the thing is,
with the situation the country's in...

583
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:13,074
Well, l just can't understand
why you chose to come back now.

584
00:50:14,077 --> 00:50:15,544
l love you so much!

585
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:17,338
Tell me about auntie.

586
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:20,974
- ls she still at home?
- l don't want to discuss her.

587
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:24,178
l don't want to discuss what you were
discussing. Don't make it harder.

588
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:25,879
Go to bed, kiddo.

589
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:30,591
Amalia, relax.
The children and us are alright.

590
00:50:34,064 --> 00:50:36,931
l can see you're alright, but...

591
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:40,868
l wanted
to propose an arrangement.

592
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:43,438
The kids come with me
and you...

593
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,872
Are you crazy?
They're my children!

594
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:48,101
- They're my grandchildren!
- They're my children.

595
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:50,711
- Don't forget it.
- Don't insist. You know how she feels.

596
00:50:50,814 --> 00:50:53,874
- l won't take orders from her!
- Kiddo, why are you here?

597
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:56,714
l sent you to bed.
Off you go!

598
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:09,060
What happened?

599
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:11,195
Did l miss something?

600
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:13,930
C'mon!

601
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:16,062
- This is a party.
- Right.

602
00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:17,871
Cake, anyone?

603
00:51:19,376 --> 00:51:20,809
You haven't drunk anything.

604
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:22,477
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

605
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:30,145
Horacito...

606
00:51:32,055 --> 00:51:35,582
Surely you understand me
on the children.

607
00:51:35,792 --> 00:51:39,728
l do, Amalia, but it won't happen.
Don't push it.

608
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:41,161
Here, Mom.

609
00:51:43,333 --> 00:51:48,270
But listen, Horacio, it's risky.
The situation's very...

610
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:49,404
Amalita...

611
00:51:49,806 --> 00:51:53,298
We're fine, the kids are alright,

612
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:55,273
you saw them,
they live a normal life.

613
00:51:55,479 --> 00:51:56,605
Normal?

614
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:00,481
You consider it normal for a kid
to use some name

615
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:03,781
and have his birthday
on some random date?

616
00:52:04,354 --> 00:52:06,117
Poor pumpkin!
That's normal?

617
00:52:06,323 --> 00:52:08,587
Know what l can't stand about you?

618
00:52:09,993 --> 00:52:14,828
Your fear, your panic.
All your life locked up in fear.

619
00:52:15,031 --> 00:52:18,523
Leave, you're in danger!
They're killing people!

620
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:21,069
You're such a coward!
Dad was right!

621
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:22,968
You never did a thing
for anyone!

622
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:26,631
- You have to leave!
- You don't know me!

623
00:52:27,177 --> 00:52:29,077
You know nothing about my ideas.

624
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:30,870
lf l die, l'd rather have

625
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:32,844
compañeros raise my kids
than you.

626
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:34,641
Hey, Charo...

627
00:52:35,385 --> 00:52:38,081
You want your children
to be guerrillas?

628
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:43,817
What's the problem?

629
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:49,866
- Do you know what the point is?
- Yes.

630
00:52:50,767 --> 00:52:51,893
What?

631
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:54,101
- Getting killed.
- Bitch.

632
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:56,897
You bitch! You're just pushing my buttons?

633
00:52:57,107 --> 00:52:59,667
Stop it! You must leave!

634
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:01,500
Enough, enough!

635
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:03,545
Lower your voices!

636
00:53:03,747 --> 00:53:05,009
No yelling here.

637
00:53:05,582 --> 00:53:07,311
Cut it out, both of you.

638
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:14,855
And you're an asshole, Beto.
An asshole.

639
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:17,356
Giant asshole, yup, that's me.

640
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:20,024
Let's all calm down.

641
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:25,231
Cool it.

642
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,061
Amalita, you know Cristina.

643
00:53:28,838 --> 00:53:31,739
You know your mother.
So, cut the crap.

644
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:37,209
Amalia... l see
where you're coming from.

645
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:41,008
And l see
that you never got any of this

646
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:42,913
and you don't get it now.

647
00:53:44,087 --> 00:53:47,022
But don't say it's madness,
because it's not.

648
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:49,715
Deep down you know it.

649
00:53:49,826 --> 00:53:51,088
Horacio...

650
00:53:52,462 --> 00:53:56,592
l know you speak from the heart.
We've known each other for ages.

651
00:53:58,501 --> 00:53:59,900
But l'm scared.

652
00:54:02,606 --> 00:54:04,403
And that's fine, Amalita.

653
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:08,705
lt's OK to be scared.

654
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,603
We're all scared.

655
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:17,078
But you have to leave.
lt's very dangerous to stay.

656
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:19,382
You have to leave.

657
00:54:20,457 --> 00:54:21,788
lt's getting late.

658
00:54:26,563 --> 00:54:27,791
We love you.

659
00:54:28,498 --> 00:54:29,465
Beto...

660
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,840
lt'll be fine, Mom.

661
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:49,314
- My little darling.
- lt'll be fine, Mom.

662
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:54,153
l swear it'll be alright.

663
00:54:58,128 --> 00:54:59,220
Juan,

664
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,123
say good-bye to grandma.

665
00:55:05,568 --> 00:55:07,035
My pumpkin.

666
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:22,144
<i>I remember when you were born.</i>

667
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:24,320
<i>Your grandma came to meet you.</i>

668
00:55:24,521 --> 00:55:26,352
<i>She was so excited.</i>

669
00:55:27,524 --> 00:55:29,389
<i>You were her first grandchild.</i>

670
00:55:30,393 --> 00:55:33,021
<i>When I told her</i>
<i>we'd decided to call you Juan.</i>

671
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:34,890
<i>she got all worked up:</i>

672
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:38,499
<i>"Juan?"she'd say.</i>
<i>"surely after Perón."</i>

673
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:42,870
<i>It's true.</i>
<i>it wasn't very originalI</i>

674
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:45,268
<i>Of course we'd named you</i>
<i>after Perón.</i>

675
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:49,705
<i>She was never able</i>
<i>to call you Juan.</i>

676
00:55:49,913 --> 00:55:51,175
<i>So she calls you Pumpkin.</i>

677
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:55,841
<i>She said when she first saw you.</i>
<i>you reminded her of a pumpkin.</i>

678
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,052
For how long?

679
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,419
Just two days.

680
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:09,255
ls your cute friend going?

681
00:56:11,468 --> 00:56:12,833
Yeah, sure.

682
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,469
Well!

683
00:56:15,105 --> 00:56:17,835
There'll be some fishing at camp.

684
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:19,272
Get off my back.

685
00:56:19,476 --> 00:56:20,773
Why?

686
00:56:22,145 --> 00:56:23,737
Nothing like them!

687
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:26,777
Nothing in the whole world
beats chicks.

688
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:29,576
Chicks?

689
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:32,654
Chicks, chicks...

690
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:35,549
María's not just any chick.

691
00:56:35,992 --> 00:56:37,687
Sorry.

692
00:56:39,295 --> 00:56:42,787
No need to clarify,
plain as daylight.

693
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:48,063
l'll let you in on a secret.

694
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:53,539
OK.

695
00:56:53,643 --> 00:56:57,704
- lnterested or not?
- Yeah, sure.

696
00:56:57,914 --> 00:56:59,040
Take a seat.

697
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,312
Chicks are like...

698
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:12,721
chocolate-coated peanuts.

699
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:16,058
- That's rubbish!
- Rubbish?

700
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,967
lt's a secret
only a handful of people know.

701
00:57:20,336 --> 00:57:22,827
You have to know
how to eat them properly.

702
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:27,869
People just suck all the coating
and are left with the hard peanut

703
00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:31,205
or just bite it right away.
lt's sacrilege.

704
00:57:32,482 --> 00:57:33,972
lt works like this.

705
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:37,719
No, slow down!

706
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:41,219
See? You rushed that one.

707
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:43,756
Now swallow it.

708
00:57:44,494 --> 00:57:46,792
Here, do exactly as l do.

709
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:50,696
Breathe, deep breath...

710
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:54,732
Now...

711
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:57,535
put it on your tongue.

712
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:06,407
Let it melt slowly.

713
00:58:09,118 --> 00:58:10,278
Feel it?

714
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:16,220
Nice, right?

715
00:58:18,261 --> 00:58:21,753
Now roll it onto your teeth...

716
00:58:26,102 --> 00:58:30,163
and bite it. Taste it slowly.

717
00:58:34,077 --> 00:58:39,447
See how those two flavors
melt into something else.

718
00:58:40,083 --> 00:58:42,950
Not peanut nor chocolate...

719
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:45,850
but chocolate-coated peanut.

720
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:49,655
Got it?

721
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:54,318
Yes, but... what does all this
have to do with María?

722
00:58:55,465 --> 00:58:57,626
What do you mean?
Everything!

723
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:01,329
You have to soften chicks up,
but not too much.

724
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:07,600
And in my opinion, you are
nearly, nearly ready to take the bite.

725
00:59:09,445 --> 00:59:11,606
- You sure?
- Positive.

726
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:15,314
But how?

727
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,948
lt's in her eyes.

728
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:20,849
She's ready.

729
00:59:21,658 --> 00:59:24,991
Believe me, do as l say
and you'll do fine.

730
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:28,555
Thanks, uncle.

731
00:59:29,165 --> 00:59:31,827
<i>I wipe my feet</i>

732
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:34,962
<i>I climb and climb to the treetop</i>

733

<i>To the treetop</i>
<i>I can't see. I can't see</i>

<i>To the bottom I can't see</i>

742
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:08,166
<i>What can it be?</i>
<i>What can it be? What can it be?</i>

743
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:16,173
<i>I can't see the mountaintop</i>

744

<i>I don't see. I can't</i>

745
01:00:32,061 --> 01:00:34,256
So, am l blind?

746
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:36,659
No!

747
01:00:37,734 --> 01:00:42,103
<i>You could use a pair</i>
<i>of decent folks' eyeglasses</i>

748
01:00:43,272 --> 01:00:44,830
<i>Decent folks' eyeglasses</i>

749
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:48,068
<i>You could use a pair</i>
<i>of decent folks' eyeglasses</i>

750
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:50,946
<i>Decent folks' eyeglasses</i>

Land in sight!

757
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:26,476
Finally, the lndies!

758
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:28,343
"What Columbus ignored

759
01:01:28,584 --> 01:01:32,213
is that he had arrived
in an unknown land: America."

760
01:01:32,388 --> 01:01:34,356
Welcome to America!

761
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:36,151
Oh, Columbus!

762
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:39,954
We bring you offerings as...
a sign of...

763
01:01:40,663 --> 01:01:43,154
- Fra...
- Fraternity.

764
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:44,563
Oh, Columbus!

765
01:01:44,734 --> 01:01:47,532
Our lands are your lands.

766
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:49,104
Oh, Columbus!

767
01:01:49,405 --> 01:01:52,101
Our wealth is your wealth.

768
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:54,039
Oh, Columbus!

769
01:01:55,812 --> 01:01:59,009
We thank God
and the Queen of Spain

770
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:02,048
for the discovery
of these wonderful lands.

771
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:05,749
And we embrace the mission
of building a great Christian nation.

772
01:02:05,855 --> 01:02:07,584
We shall educate

773
01:02:07,757 --> 01:02:10,783
and civilize them as per God's will.

774
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:12,690
Oh, Columbus!

775
01:02:13,329 --> 01:02:14,853
Bravo!

776
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:17,123
Take a bow, like true actors.

777
01:03:18,828 --> 01:03:20,523
- Shall l touch it?
- No.

778
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:24,895
- Are you alright?
- Yes.

779
01:03:27,403 --> 01:03:28,335
Come here.

780
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:02,596
Want some?

781
01:04:02,939 --> 01:04:04,736
No, thanks, l don't like it.

782
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:06,772
You don't?

783
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:08,638
l just don't.

784
01:04:13,082 --> 01:04:15,277
How can you be friends
with my brother?

785
01:04:15,484 --> 01:04:16,781
He's a jerk.

786
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:18,943
What's the matter with him?

787
01:04:20,323 --> 01:04:22,120
l don't know, you're different.

788
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:24,348
You're more...

789
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:27,321
More what?

790
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:33,794
Fuck!

791
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:35,728
Such a foul mouth.

792
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:43,835
Know where l'd like to go?

793
01:04:44,247 --> 01:04:45,339
Where?

794
01:04:45,781 --> 01:04:47,874
Brazil. Ever been there?

795
01:04:48,651 --> 01:04:49,675
No.

796
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:53,511
They say the beaches are beautiful,

797
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:56,692
soft powdery sand, like flour.

798
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:00,355
My dream's to go there.

799
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:04,458
Let's go now.

800
01:05:09,939 --> 01:05:10,997
Come on!

801
01:05:15,177 --> 01:05:17,008
Faster, faster!

802
01:05:17,713 --> 01:05:18,873
Look at the palm trees!

803
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:56,508
l'll kill you, fucking troll!

804
01:05:56,719 --> 01:05:58,687
Such bad taste, Córdoba!

805
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:00,539
Here, turtle doves!

806
01:07:03,786 --> 01:07:05,151
l look cute, right?

807
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:08,420
Sort of.

808
01:07:09,325 --> 01:07:11,259
- Shut up.
- Sort of ugly.

809
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:13,787
Ernesto!

810
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:19,493
l've gotta run.

811
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:23,694
- l'll keep it, OK?
- Yeah, my dad would kill me.

812
01:07:23,806 --> 01:07:25,137
Because of a photo?

813
01:07:26,609 --> 01:07:27,667
OK, bye.

814
01:07:43,025 --> 01:07:44,652
We're in that car.

815
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:47,655
That car?

816
01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:49,689
Dad's driving it. Get in.

817
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:51,264
What's going on?

818
01:07:55,337 --> 01:07:56,304
Hey, Dad.

819
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:00,034
Hey, kiddo.

820
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:02,375
What's going on?

821
01:08:02,478 --> 01:08:04,742
We're leaving for a few days.
Safety reasons.

822
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:06,314
Why?

823
01:08:06,982 --> 01:08:08,813
What happened?

824
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:12,486
Uncle Beto.

825
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:15,214
What?

826
01:08:15,791 --> 01:08:18,692
You heard, love.
Uncle Beto.

827
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:04,606
Compañeros, on this sad day,

828
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:08,208
l'd like to remember my brother
with the dignity he deserves.

829
01:09:09,178 --> 01:09:12,443
He once said to me
happiness wasn't about smiling,

830
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:14,548
but about believing,

831
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:17,418
having faith.

832
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:23,890
Believing so hard something is possible
that you make it happen.

833
01:09:26,095 --> 01:09:27,687
And that's how he lived.

834
01:09:30,966 --> 01:09:32,831
He had that characteristic.

835
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:40,771
Though he enjoyed
everything he did...

836
01:09:43,746 --> 01:09:46,374
he never lost his beliefs.

837
01:09:48,884 --> 01:09:52,285
l'm convinced
he was happy to his last breath.

838
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,187
Here's to my brother's balls!

839
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:02,664
To compañero Beto!

840
01:10:02,765 --> 01:10:03,993
Here!

841
01:10:05,134 --> 01:10:07,466
- To compañero Beto, dammit!
- Here!

842
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:10,002
- Perón or death!
- To the motherland!

843
01:10:26,455 --> 01:10:27,854
What happened?

844
01:10:34,797 --> 01:10:36,958
- These things just happen.
- l know.

845
01:10:38,734 --> 01:10:40,599
But l want the truth.

846
01:10:47,042 --> 01:10:48,168
Alright.

847
01:10:56,619 --> 01:10:58,849
We were making a delivery downtown.

848
01:11:00,723 --> 01:11:02,657
Everything was under control.

849
01:11:07,196 --> 01:11:09,391
As l was leaving the place...

850
01:11:12,268 --> 01:11:17,501
l see your uncle with his hands in the air
against the van. A cop behind him.

851
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:26,680
l don't know what happened.

852
01:11:31,287 --> 01:11:34,848
He must've seen something,
he freaked out, started screaming.

853
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,929
Your uncle tried
to calm him down, but...

854
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:46,900
suddenly it was swarming with cops.

855
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:54,766
Beto made a move.

856
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:01,647
He shouted:
"You won't take me alive!"

857
01:12:05,020 --> 01:12:06,885
Pulled the pin from a grenade...

858
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:11,960
and pushed the cop into the van.

859
01:12:16,365 --> 01:12:17,730
The whole thing blew up.

860
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:20,093
Goddammit!

861
01:12:25,908 --> 01:12:28,468
lt was all a matter of seconds.

862
01:12:32,948 --> 01:12:35,075
But l needed him alive.

863
01:12:36,985 --> 01:12:38,680
Who does he think he is?

864
01:12:58,807 --> 01:13:00,035
Kiddo...

865
01:13:02,177 --> 01:13:03,906
l'm going away for a few days.

866
01:13:05,748 --> 01:13:07,511
To see if we can go back home.

867
01:13:27,302 --> 01:13:29,497
l'll miss him too.

868
01:13:33,442 --> 01:13:35,103
l'll never forget him.

869
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:39,677
Me either.

870
01:13:53,362 --> 01:13:54,294
Uncle!

871
01:13:59,868 --> 01:14:01,165
What's up, kiddo?

872
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:05,200
Want some?

873
01:14:09,011 --> 01:14:11,809
So, how did it go?

874
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:16,247
Sweet!

875
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:18,214
Seriously?

876
01:14:19,354 --> 01:14:21,584
l knew it, that's my boy!

877
01:14:22,825 --> 01:14:24,816
Didn't l say she was ready?

878
01:14:26,195 --> 01:14:27,287
Yeah.

879
01:14:28,864 --> 01:14:30,126
So, now?

880
01:14:31,934 --> 01:14:33,492
What's your next move?

881
01:14:35,871 --> 01:14:37,065
l dunno.

882
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:39,469
What do you mean?

883
01:14:40,542 --> 01:14:42,203
You're a big boy now!

884
01:14:43,245 --> 01:14:44,906
With María, you mean?

885
01:14:45,113 --> 01:14:47,809
No, that's already in the bag.

886
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:50,578
l mean your life.

887
01:14:51,887 --> 01:14:52,854
l dunno.

888
01:14:53,755 --> 01:14:55,188
ls that the best you got?

889
01:14:57,125 --> 01:14:58,592
What do you suggest?

890
01:14:59,995 --> 01:15:02,486
l can't help you there.

891
01:15:04,766 --> 01:15:06,529
All l'm saying is...

892
01:15:08,003 --> 01:15:09,937
don't betray yourself.

893
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:13,298
No matter what,

894
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:16,007
don't betray yourself.

895
01:15:23,952 --> 01:15:26,785
And you? What happened?

896
01:15:26,889 --> 01:15:27,617
Nothing.

897
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:32,390
l've got those fuckers under control.
Don't you worry.

898
01:15:46,308 --> 01:15:48,333
You won't take me alive!

899
01:15:54,316 --> 01:15:54,907
Shoot!

900
01:15:57,352 --> 01:15:58,250
Don't move!

901
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:01,719
<i>I've got those fuckers under control.</i>

902
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:15,634
Juan!

903
01:16:19,474 --> 01:16:21,908
You have a fever.
Let me see.

904
01:16:25,314 --> 01:16:26,281
Why?

905
01:16:28,116 --> 01:16:31,711
Leave me alone!

906
01:16:32,321 --> 01:16:33,253
Why?

907
01:16:40,829 --> 01:16:41,955
Easy...

908
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:05,297
<i>Hello?</i>

909
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:07,766
Hello...

910
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:09,601
María?

911
01:19:09,811 --> 01:19:11,108
<i>Yes. who is this?</i>

912
01:19:11,646 --> 01:19:12,874
<i>Ernesto?</i>

913
01:19:15,016 --> 01:19:16,313
Yes.

914
01:19:17,519 --> 01:19:19,419
<i>Hello?</i>

915
01:19:19,521 --> 01:19:21,284
Yes, l'm here, l'm here.

916
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:23,986
<i>Hi. how are you?</i>

917
01:19:25,861 --> 01:19:27,624
<i>So sorry about your grandpa.</i>

918
01:19:28,663 --> 01:19:30,858
Yeah, it's too bad.

919
01:19:32,367 --> 01:19:33,459
<i>Poor thing.</i>

920
01:19:35,537 --> 01:19:37,198
<i>Hello? Are you there?</i>

921
01:19:37,906 --> 01:19:39,237
Hi, l'm here.

922
01:19:40,575 --> 01:19:43,442
l wanted to invite you
somewhere you'll love.

923
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:44,840
<i>What about school?</i>

924
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:47,908
We'll skip school today.

925
01:19:48,016 --> 01:19:49,984
- <i>Now?</i>
- Come on...

926
01:19:51,853 --> 01:19:53,616
We can miss one day.

927
01:19:55,390 --> 01:19:56,687
What are you doing?

928
01:19:57,526 --> 01:19:58,857
Who was that?

929
01:19:59,361 --> 01:20:00,988
Answer me,Juan,
who was that?

930
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:03,555
- What's the matter?
- He was on the phone.

931
01:20:03,765 --> 01:20:05,392
- Who was it?
- On the phone?

932
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:06,692
Answer me!

933
01:20:07,502 --> 01:20:08,992
María.

934
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:10,935
- Who the fuck's María?
- My girlfriend.

935
01:20:11,173 --> 01:20:13,733
Fuck,Juan!
Girlfriend, my ass, cut the crap!

936
01:20:13,942 --> 01:20:17,901
Just what we need now! Know how
dangerous it is to use the phone?

937
01:20:18,113 --> 01:20:20,673
- Yes, l know.
- So, what's wrong with you?

938
01:20:20,882 --> 01:20:26,252
You know you're not going back
to school anymore. That's over.

939
01:20:26,454 --> 01:20:32,086
Kiddo, you have to help mom pack
and suck it up like a man.

940
01:20:33,328 --> 01:20:35,387
What am l supposed
to stay here for?

941
01:20:35,597 --> 01:20:37,064
Doing what, dammit?

942
01:20:37,265 --> 01:20:39,358
Hey, calm down, lower your voice.

943
01:20:43,772 --> 01:20:45,831
This isn't easy on any of us.

944
01:20:47,909 --> 01:20:49,501
No point getting worked up.

945
01:20:50,612 --> 01:20:53,172
We have to take things
as they come.

946
01:20:54,416 --> 01:20:55,781
Easy for you to say.

947
01:20:55,984 --> 01:20:57,110
Excuse me?

948
01:20:57,319 --> 01:20:59,651
- Nothing.
- Cut the crap,Juan.

949
01:20:59,888 --> 01:21:01,253
You're a big boy!

950
01:21:39,261 --> 01:21:40,125
Bye.

951
01:22:07,555 --> 01:22:08,487
María!

952
01:22:24,539 --> 01:22:25,665
How are you?

953
01:22:28,743 --> 01:22:29,732
Fine.

954
01:22:30,211 --> 01:22:31,473
So you're back?

955
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:34,342
No, l'm still there,
l'm a ghost.

956
01:22:34,983 --> 01:22:37,247
ldiot.
How was the funeral?

957
01:22:38,887 --> 01:22:40,411
Fine, it was fine.

958
01:22:43,024 --> 01:22:45,515
- Shall we go?
- OK.

959
01:25:44,973 --> 01:25:47,100
l have a confession to make.

960
01:25:50,211 --> 01:25:53,271
l have strong feelings for you.

961
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:55,345
Here in my stomach.

962
01:25:56,651 --> 01:25:58,551
l feel that too.

963
01:25:58,753 --> 01:25:59,811
You do?

964
01:26:01,122 --> 01:26:05,559
There are things you don't understand,
and that's fine.

965
01:26:08,630 --> 01:26:11,827
And there are other things
you won't understand now.

966
01:26:12,634 --> 01:26:13,896
You know?

967
01:26:16,304 --> 01:26:18,738
l know
l'm not making myself clear.

968
01:26:20,108 --> 01:26:22,440
But this thing l feel is real.

969
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:28,539
Remember when you said...

970
01:26:29,651 --> 01:26:31,744
l wasn't like the others?

971
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:35,054
That's it, you see.

972
01:26:37,692 --> 01:26:39,922
l am who you think l am,

973
01:26:40,528 --> 01:26:42,723
only... different.

974
01:26:44,265 --> 01:26:45,459
You know?

975
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:49,902
Not at all,
but l still think you're cute.

976
01:26:54,642 --> 01:26:56,337
l want to be with you forever.

977
01:26:57,011 --> 01:26:58,672
Promise?

978
01:26:58,913 --> 01:27:00,471
Cross my heart.

979
01:27:03,952 --> 01:27:05,283
Look.

980
01:27:06,588 --> 01:27:08,078
l have a surprise for you.

981
01:27:10,658 --> 01:27:13,024
l've got money, loads of money.

982
01:27:17,031 --> 01:27:17,998
So?

983
01:27:19,734 --> 01:27:22,828
So we can be together.
We can be together forever.

984
01:27:23,037 --> 01:27:24,698
We're together now.

985
01:27:25,139 --> 01:27:27,801
Yes but we'll be able to go
wherever we want.

986
01:27:28,009 --> 01:27:30,000
