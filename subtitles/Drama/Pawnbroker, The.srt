Captioning made possible by
Artisan entertainment

2
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,300
Sol?

3
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,500
Solly?

4
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,000
I just made some
fresh lemonade, Solly.

5
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,600
It's going to be
a nice day.

6
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,000
Not too hot.

7
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,300
Man: ohh!

8
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,500
Your back again,
papa?

9
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,800
Aww.

10
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,000
Why don't you move
into the shade, Sol?

11
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Good morning,
uncle Sol.

12
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,500
Mother,
i was thinking.

13
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,100
If we could only
afford it,

14
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,100
Danish modern
would be so perfect.

15
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,100
Solly?

16
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,300
The editorial section.

17
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,100
So, Solly...

18
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,500
What do you think, huh?

19
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,600
About what?
What I told you
at brunch.

20
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,600
After all,
you live here, too.

21
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,900
You're paying
for it.

22
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,000
It really is
up to you.

23
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,000
Buy it and keep it.

24
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,100
What?

25
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,000
I said buy it...

26
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,000
Keep it...

27
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:40,000
The AM-FM television.

28
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
That's not what I mean.

29
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I mean about
the trip to Europe.

30
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Radio:
* I don't wanna be... *
Turn it down, joan.

31
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,000
This music bother you,
uncle Sol?

32
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,200
You sure you wouldn't
like some lemonade?

33
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,600
Did you sleep
long enough, my son?

34
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,500
I wasn't sleeping.
No. He was drawing
his pornographic pictures.

35
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,100
Give me that!

36
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,600
Oh, look at it!

37
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,100
My god! Look!
It's a nude girl!

38
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,200
Look at that,
uncle Sol! My god!

39
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:24,100
What have you
been doing? Ha ha!
Give it back to me!

40
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,100
Look what your son's
been doing!

41
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,600
Don't you know girls
aren't built that way!

42
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,100
All right!
Enough already, will you?

43
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,600
Why can't you
leave me alone?

44
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,200
As soon as you
come around, my son,

45
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,000
There's a disturbance.
Morton,
comb your hair, Morton.

46
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,500
You look like
some kind of character
With your hair like that.

47
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,500
Edward's picking me
up in 10 minutes,

48
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,600
And I don't want you
to frighten him.

49
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,600
What happens
to the time?

50
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,400
25 years. Do you
realize it, Sol?

51
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,900
Do I realize what?
25 years
next thursday.

52
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,100
Did you
know that, Sol?

53
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,400
Yes.

54
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,500
My sister.

55
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,900
My poor sister Ruth.
Mother.

56
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,200
25 years.

57
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,800
My sister Ruth was
beautiful like a picture.

58
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,400
Uncle Solly knows
how beautiful, mother.
He was married to her.

59
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:29,600
Sol, all you have to do
is say yes or no.

60
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,500
A final yes or no.

61
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,600
A final yes or no
about what?

62
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,500
The trip to Europe.

63
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,000
You want to go
to Europe, Bertha?

64
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,000
Not me, so much,
But they have
family plans now,

65
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,800
So why not?
It's a 17-day tour.

66
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,000
And why do you want
to go to Europe?

67
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,700
Mostly, it's him.
He says it'd be very good

68
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,300
For his standing
with the school board.

69
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,700
And he's always wanted
to visit there, anyhow.

70
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,300
The shrines
and the old cities-

71
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,600
There's an atmosphere
we don't have here.

72
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,600
Something
mellow.

73
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,700
Age lends
its own charm.

74
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,500
Why, you can almost
smell the difference.

75
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,200
It's rather like
a stink if I remember.

76
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,300
<i>Allí esta tu jefe,
Jesus!</i>
No spanish, mama.

77
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,200
No spanish.
English.

78
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,800
You hurry now.

79
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,700
Couple of weeks
working for him

80
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,300
Ain't long enough
for you to be late.

81
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,800
Mama, you know what
your trouble is?

82
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,800
You know your trouble?
You worry!
You worry.

83
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,800
Now, me,
i don't worry, mama.

84
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,300
You know why?

85
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,800
Because I am going
a long way, mama.

86
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,200
Yeah! A long way.

87
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,800
Jesus...

88
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,800
No more trouble.
No more things
like that, Jesus.

89
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,300
No. No more, mama.

90
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:15,300
No more stealing,
no more numbers,

91
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,300
No more peddling,
no more nothing.

92
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,300
Strictly legit, ok?

93
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,300
Ok.

94
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,200
Mister?

95
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,700
How much will you
give me for this?

96
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm here!

97
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,400
Let the business
now commence.

98
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,100
Ah, come on, now,
Mr. Nazerman.

99
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,600
Don't look that way, now.

100
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,600
Listen, i'm going
to insist-

101
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,600
I insist you dock me
exactly 20 minutes I late.

102
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,600
On the other hand,
I'll work so hard
for the next few hours

103
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,100
That you'll wind up
giving me time and a half.

104
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,100
To start with, i'm going
to open the front.

105
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,600
It's an award
for oratory.

106
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,100
I won it in a citywide
oratorical contest

107
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,600
Five years ago.
It's gold.

108
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,100
$1.00.

109
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,600
$1.00 for an important
award like this?

110
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,600
20,000 started.

111
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,000
50 semifinalists,
and I won.

112
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,100
I recited "the raven."

113
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,100
I was 1 of 20,000.

114
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,800
$1.00. Still at
the same address?

115
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,700
Uh-huh.
But it's gold.

116
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,300
Plate. $1.00.

117
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,600
Man the lifeboats!

118
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,900
Here I is again.
All right.
Gimme a dollar.

119
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,500
Honest and true,
It's like bailing out
an old leaky boat

120
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,200
Filled with holes.

121
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,200
You pawn something,
You buy something else,
and then you pawn that.

122
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,700
Each time, the boat's
gettin' deeper into the water.

123
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,700
Ha ha! Ain't it a wonder
a body stay afloat

124
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,700
As long as it do?

125
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,100
Aw, come on,
Mr. Nazerman. Smile.

126
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,700
Here I am with
a load of profit for you.

127
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,700
They's heirloom.
Makes a table
look like a table.

128
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,100
I'll sell them
for $10 a pair.

129
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,200
$2.00.

130
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,700
My goodness!

131
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,100
Why, these candlesticks
is very high quality.
Cost $25 when new.

132
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,600
Now, I could get $15 easy
down at Triboro pawn.

133
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:51,200
I suggest, mrs. Harmon,
That you take them
down to triboro pawn.

134
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,700
Ha ha ha!

135
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,200
You a merciless man
for sure.

136
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,600
$2.00!

137
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,200
Oh, i'm too pooped
to haggle, Mr. Nazerman.

138
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,700
Sold!

139
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:15,200
Oh, you's a hard man.
God pity you.

140
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,700
He's the only judge,
after all.

141
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,800
Be seeing you again,
Mr. Nazerman,

142
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,700
And that's for sure.

143
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,000
Take care now,
you hear?

144
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,700
Wait a minute,
mrs. Harmon.

145
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,200
You forgot
your ticket,

146
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,400
And you forgot
your $2.00.

147
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:43,200
You know,
i've been thinking.
Them suits in the back?

148
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,700
I'll make
a list of them,

149
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,700
First according
to the size,

150
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,800
And then another one
according to condition,

151
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,300
And then the type.
You know,
what I mean by that

152
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,300
Is summer or serge
or gabardine.

153
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,300
You know, that way
any suit anybody wants,

154
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,300
Pow! Put my finger on it
right away.

155
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm just filled
with good ideas, man.

156
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,700
Good morning,
Mr. Nazerman.

157
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,800
Good morning.

158
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,000
$2.00.

159
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,800
Quite incidentally,
Mr. Nazerman,

160
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,800
I've just been reading
a very remarkable book-

161
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:33,800
<i>Herbert Spencer's
genesis of science.</i>

162
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:38,700
Yes, but then you
probably know it well.

163
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,700
It's a very good book.

164
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,200
I- I particularly like
his insistence

165
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,300
That science
is born of art,

166
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,300
Not the other way
around.

167
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,800
To me,
this was refreshing,

168
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:59,800
Coming from a man
That most modern thinkers
called old-fashioned.

169
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,800
Did any of your students
think of that

170
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,300
While you were
at Leipzig?

171
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,800
But Spencer didn't come up
with anything very new, really.

172
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,300
Pythagoras,
an artist at heart

173
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,300
And a great lover
of music,

174
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,900
Made the discovery that
the pitch of sound

175
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:25,400
Depends upon the length
of the vibrating string.

176
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:30,800
That was six centuries
before Christ.

177
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,900
I... I, uh...

178
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,800
From time to time,
I like to
drop in here

179
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,800
Because,
Mr. Nazerman,

180
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,800
A man gets hungry
for talk. Good talk.

181
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,900
There's your ticket,
and there's your $2.00.

182
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,900
Mr. Nazerman...

183
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,400
$2.00 will be...
quite all right.

184
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,400
I...

185
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:03,900
I apologize for talking
so much, Mr. Nazerman.

186
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,800
D- d-did...

187
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,800
Forgive me.

188
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,300
Yes?

189
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,800
Nazerman?
How's business,
Nazerman?

190
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,400
Business is
the same as usual.

191
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,200
We spend more money
than we take in.

192
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:34,800
Good. Pretty soon Uncle Sam
will have to pay us money,
Subsidize us.

193
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,400
Can't expect taxes from
a losing business, can they?

194
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,000
Ha ha ha!
That's funny, huh?

195
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,100
That's
pretty funny, huh?

196
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,100
I asked you a question,
professor.

197
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,100
Pawnshop.
Nazerman?

198
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,000
Yes, sir.
It's for you.

199
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,100
Yes?

200
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,900
We get disconnected
or something?
No. I hung up.

201
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,100
The word professor.
I don't like it.

202
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,100
You were a professor
once, weren't you?

203
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,100
What about that?

204
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,000
I asked you a question,
nazerman.

205
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,600
I don't like the word
professor from you.

206
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,000
I don't like
the way you say it.

207
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,300
Something else
bothering you?

208
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,100
Listen...

209
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,100
There'll be a new man
in later tonight.

210
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,600
He'll give you an estimate
for some repair work.

211
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,600
You give him a check.

212
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:02,000
He'll give you
your change in cash.
What's his name?

213
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,100
Savarese.

214
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,200
You be there,
professor.

215
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,100
Good morning.

216
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,700
My name is
Marilyn Birchfield.

217
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,400
I'm introducing
myself around.

218
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,400
In a sense,
i'm a new neighbor.

219
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,500
Yes?

220
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,600
I'm with the new youth
center down the block.

221
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,900
I thought i'd make
myself known

222
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,600
To the shopkeepers
in the vicinity

223
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,100
And perhaps get
some kind of help.

224
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,400
Support.

225
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,700
And?

226
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,100
Well, to get down to it,
Mr. Nazerman,

227
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,900
I'd like to put your name
down as a tentative sponsor.

228
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,700
Later on, we'll see what
you'd be willing to do and give.

229
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,700
Perhaps you could
see your way clear

230
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,200
To sponsoring one of
the children's teams.

231
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,200
You might even like to devote
evenings to coaching.

232
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,100
Have you any experience
with basketball?

233
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,600
Basketball.

234
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,600
You must be joking.

235
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,700
Well, uh...
Come to redeem,
uncle!

236
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,200
Possibly with
one of the crafts.

237
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:30,200
You don't have to make up
your mind right away.

238
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,300
Perhaps you'd like
to think about it.

239
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,700
I just wanted
to introduce myself.

240
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:38,400
That's always
the hardest part for me.
I get very tense

241
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,400
When I have to introduce
myself to people.

242
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,000
We all have to do things
we don't like sometimes.

243
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,400
If you're looking
for a handout,

244
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,200
Why don't you say so?
That's $18.75.

245
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,700
I don't regard these
contributions as handouts,

246
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,200
And i'm very sorry
that you do.

247
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,700
I think that anything
one can do for these children

248
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,700
Is an investment
in one's own future.

249
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,600
I'm not particularly
concerned with the future.
How much do you want?

250
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,700
I'll take anything
you're willing to give,

251
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,300
Regardless of
how it's given.

252
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,700
Is that the name
of the organization
I make the check out to?

253
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:18,000
Yes. The important thing is
the money will be well spent.

254
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:21,200
Do you always think
the worst of everyone?

255
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,500
A lot of people come
in here collecting-

256
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,700
Blind people
with 20/20 vision,

257
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,700
Deaf people who could hear
the tumblers on my safe

258
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,200
When I dial
the combination.

259
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,000
So with this experience,
i say why not you?

260
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,700
All right.
Why not me?

261
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,400
How much are you
willing to give?

262
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:52,600
You see, I have no pride.

263
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,300
And since you've been
so cooperative,
I'll come back again...

264
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,700
And again... and again.

265
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,800
Mr. Nazerman...

266
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,300
When are you
going to?

267
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,400
What?

268
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,800
To teach me.

269
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,300
Later.

270
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,900
Listen, your ad
in the paper said,

271
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,300
"A bright, willing-
to-learn young man."

272
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,400
That's why
i answered it.

273
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,200
And right now,
Mr. Nazerman,

274
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:43,700
I feel special bright
and special willing.

275
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,100
<i>Hey! Ol!</i>

276
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,600
Ooh! Aay! Ya-ha!

277
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,100
Later.
When?

278
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,600
Tonight.

279
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,100
That's good enough
for me!

280
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,100
I just got to learn
this business!

281
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,100
I just got to...

282
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,200
What's you saying,
Jesus?

283
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,800
How you doing?

284
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,200
Ain't it wild?

285
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,600
This thing is brand new.

286
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,500
Never been used.

287
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,500
Blades shiny, sharp,

288
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,800
Cut grass
down to the skin.

289
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,500
Yellow paint, gold paint,

290
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,800
Last a lifetime.

291
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,100
Where'd you get it?

292
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,700
What?

293
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,600
Why, it's a gift.

294
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,100
Yeah, a gift.

295
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,100
I would've returned it
To the store
my friend bought it,

296
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,100
Only I was embarrassed
to ask him where.

297
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,300
Ain't that the tRuth, man?

298
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,700
You understand the police have
lists of stolen merchandise?

299
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,600
Oh, now, man,
i ain't stole it!

300
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,600
A friend,
a friend give it to me.

301
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,900
Now, he figure
i make use of it.

302
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,800
Where'd you get these
numbers tattooed, uncle?

303
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,100
Aw, come on,
now, uncle.

304
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,300
Will you take
the thing?

305
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,200
Will you please
take the thing?

306
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,300
I'll give you $30.

307
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,700
Sold.

308
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:13,100
I ain't no trouble
at all.

309
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,800
Pleasure to do
business with you,

310
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,200
Ain't I now?

311
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,200
We be in again, uncle.

312
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,100
See you later, Ortiz.

313
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,700
Friends of yours,
Ortiz?

314
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,600
Oh, I know them.

315
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,700
Give me the number
on that contraption.

316
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,700
It's, uh...

317
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,200
"1-0-7... "

318
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,700
1-0-7...

319
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,200
"1-2."

320
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,300
1-2.

321
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,800
Mr. Nazerman...

322
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,800
You want to tell me
something, Mr. Nazerman,

323
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,700
What is that?

324
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,800
That. Is that a secret
society or something?

325
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,300
Yeah.

326
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,700
Yeah, well,
what do I do to join?

327
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,700
What do you do to join?

328
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,300
You learn
to walk on water.

329
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,800
Mr. Nazerman.
Mm-hmm.

330
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,700
Teach me gold.

331
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,700
Huh?

332
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,800
Well...

333
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,200
All right.
I'll teach you gold.

334
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,300
You know,
i got this uncle,
He lives in detroit,

335
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,900
He's been in business
for 42 years.

336
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,400
Grocery store.

337
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,800
You know, my old lady
tells me that that man

338
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:21,300
Is as Solid as
the rock of Gibraltar.

339
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,300
Every time his business is
getting bigger and bigger.

340
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,300
Even the cops
call him mister.

341
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,800
And he got this son.
He's about my age.

342
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,800
That kid in the store

343
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:39,300
Is going to get it all
when my uncle kick off.

344
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,300
You know what I mean.

345
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:45,200
That business
makes him Solid.
Like a king a little.

346
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:49,800
He passes his crown
down to his kids.

347
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,800
Me, i'm going
to get me a business.

348
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:57,300
I got that in my mind
for sure.

349
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,900
All I need
is the loot.

350
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:03,900
Well, you save
your pennies.
I'm going to do that.

351
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,900
Yes, sir,
i'm going to do that.

352
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:11,400
In the meantime,
I'm learning business
from a master.

353
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,900
You'll never learn it
Unless you pay attention
and stop talking.

354
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,900
Ok, i'm a clam.
Teach me gold.
Pay attention.

355
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,400
You take an object
like this watch.

356
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,400
This is a touchstone.
Rub it on the touchstone
like that.

357
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,900
See that? That leaves
a mark there.

358
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,400
Then you take
a little acid,

359
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,900
And you put it on that
mark on the touchstone

360
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,900
Like that.

361
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,400
Now you watch it,
you see?

362
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,000
Now, if that turns
a bright green,

363
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,400
Then that means
it's brass.
Let me write it down.

364
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,900
All right.
Bright green means
it's brass, right?

365
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,300
If it turns a milky white,
that means it's silver.

366
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,600
The name's savarese.

367
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:16,700
Redecorate the whole
damn place, uncle,
Say, 5,000 bucks.

368
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,700
Who do I make
the check out to?

369
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,700
The ACME
contracting company.

370
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,600
That's A-C...
M- E.

371
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,700
Be a good job, uncle.

372
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,000
Paint the whole damn
place pink and yellow.

373
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,200
Pink and yellow.
That's marvelous.

374
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,700
Your change-
5,000 bucks.

375
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,100
Count it.

376
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,500
Don't touch that.

377
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,500
What? Getting ready
for monday.

378
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,700
Back here on monday,
it'll be october.

379
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,200
Let's leave it
september, shall we?
How come?

380
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,700
Don't ask me how come.
Just do what I tell you.

381
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,400
Leave the calendar
alone and go home.

382
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:25,500
I'll see you monday,
And you sure will be
here on time, you hear?

383
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,700
I'm going to be here
practically early.

384
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,000
Get him!

385
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,300
Tessie!

386
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,800
What are you, a nut
or something? You moron!

387
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:49,800
Let's just go up
And sit down
and talk awhile.

388
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,400
I'm tired.
You know, my boss...

389
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,900
My boss been working my
back off all afternoon.

390
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,400
Oh, I don't like you
working too hard.

391
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,900
I don't like you
using all your energy.

392
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:04,400
Do you know me not
to have enough energy?

393
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,400
So don't
worry none, baby.

394
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,400
All you got to do

395
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,400
Is be around
when I do this.

396
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,300
Come here. Come here.
Ha ha ha!

397
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,700
Hey, Ortiz.
Hiya, Tangee.

398
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,500
Talking about you
a second ago.

399
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,500
You know what else?

400
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:34,500
Robinson couldn't believe
one word I told him.

401
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:39,200
He say, "how come
a smart boy like Ortiz

402
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,000
Working in the pawnshop?"

403
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,500
Ain't it what you say?

404
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,000
How come a smart boy
like Ortiz

405
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:50,800
Working in the pawnshop?
That's my business.

406
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:54,100
Now, now,
now don't get uptight.

407
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:56,100
Just how come?
That's all.

408
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,600
I mean, how come
you work there?

409
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,100
He's got his plans!
Crowd: shh!

410
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,600
He's learnin'.

411
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,200
It's a good business.

412
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:09,100
It's a chicken business-

413
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:12,100
$2.00 loan, $5.00 loan.

414
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,600
Peanuts.

415
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,900
You think?

416
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:18,500
Peanuts.
Try $5,000, man,

417
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,600
'Cause that's
what Mr. Nazerman

418
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,300
Must've put
in his safe.

419
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,000
Is he here?

420
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,700
Can't he sleep again
tonight, tessie?

421
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:56,000
Is that why
he came here,

422
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:59,500
To bring joy to his
dead friend's wife?

423
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,600
Shut the door, tess.

424
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,100
Close the door

425
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,100
And shut me off
from the two of you.

426
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,600
Shut me off from
the land of the dead.

427
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,700
He'll never forgive us

428
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,800
For sleeping
together, Sol.

429
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:35,100
To him, i'm still
Reuben's wife.

430
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,900
Honey?

431
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,300
You like me, huh?

432
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,700
Oh, honey, you know
why you do that?

433
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,200
'Cause you and me,
honey,

434
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,700
When that happens,

435
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,600
You and me can't be
nothin' better.

436
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,200
He's asleep.

437
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,200
That man Nazerman...

438
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,800
He knows things.

439
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:16,900
Baby, I wonder how much
it takes to open a pawnshop.

440
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,600
Hey, do you think 5,000?

441
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,600
Do you think 5,000,
baby?

442
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,800
Yeah. Must be.

443
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:29,000
I can help you
get that money.

444
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,800
I can. I can give
private sessions

445
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,900
And no splits
to the boss.

446
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,800
Honey, I can make us
an extra 100 or 2 a week.

447
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,800
I can go in with you.

448
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,800
I can be
a partner to you.

449
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,800
You know?

450
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,800
Yeah. That could be.

451
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,300
That could be, baby.

452
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,800
We'll see.

453
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,400
Is it your play
or my play?

454
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,000
Yours.
Mine.

455
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,700
I'll fix the calendar.
No.

456
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,800
Mr. Nazerman,
are you all right?

457
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,600
You...

458
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,700
You look... bad.

459
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,200
Don't stand there.
Find something to do.

460
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,700
Go on.
Find something to do.

461
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,100
Hey, uncle,
how much you give me

462
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:03,100
For this radio, huh?
Now, this hot
little old radio, man,

463
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,600
Is worth
plenty of rubles, man.
It's got lots of juice.

464
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,500
It's got short wave,
police call, boats.

465
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,800
Late at night, man,
you get outer space.

466
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,600
Come on, uncle,
just make me an offer.

467
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,500
Now, this is
a hundred-dollar radio.

468
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:23,500
It's got a clear tone.
Boy, that's clear as
a mother's old bell.

469
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,600
Come on, baby.

470
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,000
Show the man
your power, baby.

471
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,700
Blast him! Give him
some of that tone!

472
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,000
Oh, man,
you radio, you mother!

473
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,000
I'll give you $2.00.

474
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,400
You turn chicken on me,
radio, huh?

475
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,300
You always play
better than that!

476
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,800
It must be on account
of the heat, you know?

477
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:49,800
I'll tell you what.
You give me $8.00, huh?

478
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:53,300
I mean, that's-that's
my mother's radio.

479
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,300
I said
i'll give you $2.00

480
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,300
Come on. $5.00, you
blood-sucking cheater!

481
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,500
You money-grabbing
kike! 5!

482
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,900
Still live at
the same address?

483
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,800
Mm-hmm.
Aw, man, I'll-

484
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,300
I'll take
the 2 rubles, man.

485
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,900
You just give me
the 2. Take it.

486
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,500
I'm sorry, Mr. Nazerman.
For what?

487
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,500
For what that young man
said to you.

488
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:40,100
Sell your sorrow somewhere else,
miss Birchfield.

489
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,600
I came here mainly
to apologize.

490
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,800
For what?

491
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,300
I was tactless
the other day.

492
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,100
I forced myself on you.
I got angry.

493
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,900
It's bothered me
the whole weekend.

494
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,400
I suppose you think
I'm rather silly.

495
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,500
Walking over here
though,

496
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,900
I had a sensible
conversation with myself.

497
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,900
Would you like
to hear it?

498
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,400
How nice I thought
it would be

499
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,900
If you and i
had lunch together.

500
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:17,600
Like wednesday?
Thursday?

501
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,100
I'll bring
some sandwiches.

502
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,300
We'll have them
in the park.

503
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:24,400
Certainly you must be
joking, miss Birchfield.

504
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,100
Oh, no, I'm not.

505
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,500
Don't you think
it's rather-

506
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,600
No. No. Please,
don't say stupid.

507
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,800
Don't demean it.
I came to apologize.

508
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,200
So you came to
apologize and...

509
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:47,100
I accept your apology.
You have to excuse me.

510
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,100
What can I do for you?

511
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,100
Well, what do you want?

512
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,700
My diamond
engagement ring.

513
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,700
I want to borrow.

514
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,100
It's glass.

515
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,100
Glass?

516
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,400
He said it was real.

517
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,800
Wednesday or thursday?

518
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,000
What?

519
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:48,400
Lunch in the park.
Wednesday's
better for me.

520
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:54,200
Wednesday, thursday,
whatever you like.

521
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:57,500
All right.
I'll see you then.

522
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,300
Fine. Fine.

523
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,300
Teaching time,
Mr. Nazerman.

524
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,800
Time to teach.

525
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:20,200
Now, last time you
taught me gold, right?

526
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,700
What are you going
to teach me tonight?

527
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,200
Tonight I teach you
to save your pennies.

528
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,900
I'm going to do that,
Mr. Nazerman. Yes, sir.

529
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,900
Now, in the meantime,

530
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,900
I'm learning business
from a master, right?

531
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,900
So I got to know
one thing,

532
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:38,400
Something I've been
thinking about.

533
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,300
How come you people come
to business so naturally?

534
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,700
"You people"?

535
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,300
Oh, I see. Yeah.

536
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:53,000
I see. I see.
You, uh...

537
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,800
You want to learn
the secret

538
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,500
Of our success.
Is that right?

539
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,600
All right.
I'll teach you.

540
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:02,500
First of all,
you start off

541
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,700
With a period of
several thousand years

542
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,500
During which you have
nothing to sustain you

543
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,500
But a great
bearded legend.

544
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,500
You have no land
to call your own,

545
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:13,500
To grow food on
or to hunt.
You have nothing.

546
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,000
You're never in
one place long enough

547
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:18,100
To have a geography
or army or land myth.

548
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,000
All you have
is a little brain.

549
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:23,300
A little brain and
a great bearded legend

550
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,700
To sustain you
and convince you
That you are...

551
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,700
Special...
even in poverty.

552
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:33,400
But this, uh...

553
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:40,400
This little brain-
That's the real key,
you see.

554
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,900
With this little brain
You go out and buy
a piece of cloth.

555
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,900
Cut that cloth in two.
Sell it for a penny more
than you paid for it.

556
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,900
Buy another cloth.
Cut it into 3 pieces.

557
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Sell it for
3 pennies profit.

558
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:56,500
But during that time
you must never succumb

559
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,800
To buying an extra piece
of bread for the table

560
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,500
Or a toy
for a child. No!

561
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,300
No, you must
immediately run out

562
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:05,000
And get yourself a still
larger piece of cloth.

563
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:07,500
So you repeat this
process over and over,

564
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,500
And suddenly you
discover something.

565
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,600
You have no longer
any desire,

566
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,700
Any temptation to dig into
the earth to grow food

567
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,300
Or gaze at limitless land
and call it your own.

568
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,600
No, no. You just
go on and on,

569
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:22,600
Repeating this process
over the centuries.

570
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:24,500
And suddenly you make
a grand discovery.

571
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:28,000
You have
a mercantile heritage.
You are a merchant.

572
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,100
You're known
as a usurer,

573
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,500
A man with
secret resources,

574
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,000
A witch,
a pawnbroker,

575
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,800
A sheeny, a mockie,
and a kike!

576
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:48,300
You're really some
teacher, Mr. Nazerman.

577
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,800
You're really...

578
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,900
Really the greatest.

579
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,400
Jesus?

580
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,600
Yeah?

581
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,100
<i>¿Como va tu trabajo?</i>

582
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:00,700
<i>Va bien, mama.
Muy bien.</i>
<i>¿Si?</i>

583
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,900
<i>Si.</i>
<i>¿Te gusta tu jefe?</i>

584
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,700
<i>Quien, Nazerman?
Si.</i>
Uh-huh.

585
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,500
<i>Sabe muchas cosas.</i>
<i>Si?</i>

586
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:13,400
<i>Estoy apprendiendo
muchas cosas por l.</i>
<i>Ay, que bueno.</i>

587
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:16,900
<i>Algun dia voy a tener
mi propio negocio.</i>

588
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,400
<i>Ay, que bueno.</i>
<i>Uno no va salir del tapo
careo apartamento.</i>

589
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,900
<i>Entonces quiere decir
que de ahora en adelante</i>

590
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:25,900
<i>Vas hacer
buen muchacho.</i>

591
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,900
Of course.
I am a very good boy.

592
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,900
<i>I am a good boy.</i>

593
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,100
<i>Un buen muchacho.</i>

594
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,300
Ok, good boy.
Say good boy.

595
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,600
<i>Pero...</i>
Good boy.

596
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,000
<i>No es lo mismo
que decir goodbye?</i>

597
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:44,100
<i>No, es otra cosa.
Ven aquí. Ven aquí.</i>

598
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,700
Good boy.
Say good boy.

599
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:47,800
Good.

600
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:49,000
Good...

601
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:51,300
Boy.

602
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,900
Right. I am...

603
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,100
I am...

604
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:57,100
A good-I am.
I am. I am...

605
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:01,600
I am...
A good...

606
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:04,500
A good boy.

607
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,600
Nazerman...

608
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:11,600
I can't even look
at him anymore.
I start to blush.

609
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:14,200
...Nazerman
of leipzig.
Look, Tessie...

610
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:17,100
Don't be an
hysterical woman.

611
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,100
Neither one of us
has done anything

612
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,600
That we should
feel guilty about.

613
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:24,900
You'd better go
and see him.

614
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I was in Auschwitz, too.

615
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,700
I came out alive.

616
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,500
You came out dead.

617
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:38,100
I'll have some coffee
for you when you come out.
Yeah. Yeah.

618
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,700
Guilt.

619
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:19,500
And there it is.
Guilt to find
yourself alive.

620
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,600
And so you
wrap yourself

621
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:24,400
In a kind of shroud

622
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:26,900
And feel you share
the dignity of death

623
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,900
With those
who really died.

624
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,600
Tell me...

625
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:37,600
Does blood ever flow
through you, Sol Nazerman?

626
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:41,400
Can you feel pain?

627
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:46,600
No.

628
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:49,300
You are a fake.

629
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:52,600
You breathe,
you eat, you walk.

630
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:54,700
You make money.

631
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:58,600
You take a dream
and give a dollar...

632
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:00,400
And give no hope.

633
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,800
I survive.
Survive?

634
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:07,400
A coward's survival,
and at what a price!

635
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,800
No love. No passion.

636
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:13,100
No pity! Dead!

637
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,700
Sol Nazerman,
the walking dead!

638
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,100
It's wednesday.

639
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,200
Yeah,
so it's wednesday.

640
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:45,100
We were to have lunch
together.

641
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:49,100
In fact, you set
the day yourself.

642
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,900
Had you forgotten?

643
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,100
Yes, I'm afraid I had.

644
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,600
Well, it-
it doesn't matter.
Here I am.

645
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,600
Miss Birchfield, I feel
i must be honest with you.

646
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:08,500
I do not wish to inflict
a failure on you,

647
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,200
But I do not welcome
your interest.

648
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:22,800
You were in
a concentration camp,
Weren't you?

649
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:25,000
That's no concern
of yours.

650
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:44,100
Would you like to hear
a little about me?

651
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,600
It really
doesn't matter.

652
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:49,100
No, I don't believe you
when you say that.

653
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:52,100
When I was a little girl,

654
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:56,200
I was fat and amiable,
and everyone liked me.

655
00:50:56,300 --> 00:51:00,200
The boys used to think
i was a great sport.

656
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:03,300
I remember some of them
even told me solemnly

657
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:06,700
That I reminded them
of their sisters.

658
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,400
Well, in that
odd category,

659
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,300
I went to lots
of parties

660
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:12,700
And I had
loads of friends

661
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,200
And there was
nothing wrong.

662
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:19,200
Until one day I discovered
that I'd acquired...

663
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:23,400
A most
excruciating malady...

664
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,600
Loneliness.

665
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:35,100
One day there was
a young man.

666
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,200
We fell in love.

667
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,000
We got married.

668
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:44,600
He died. Like that.

669
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,400
His heart just stopped.

670
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:53,000
And I found out
that loneliness

671
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:55,500
Is the normal state
of affairs.

672
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,300
For most people.

673
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:04,800
My dear miss Birchfield,
How touchingly
naive you are.

674
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:08,800
Oh! You have
discovered loneliness!

675
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:14,100
You have found out that
the world is unjust and cruel.

676
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,700
Let me tell you something,
my dear sociologist-

677
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:20,100
That there is a world
different than yours,

678
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:24,800
Much different, and the people
in it are of another species.

679
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:29,900
Now, I ask you
a question.

680
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,800
What do you know?

681
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,500
I guess
I'm out of my depth.

682
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:39,100
Oh, I would say so.

683
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:43,200
But what happened
to me-
Is nothing.

684
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,100
No!

685
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:48,200
That's not so.

686
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,900
What makes you so bitter?

687
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:53,600
Bitter? Oh, no,
miss Birchfield,

688
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:58,100
I am not bitter.
No, that passed me by
a million years ago.

689
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:00,100
I'm a man
of no anger.

690
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,600
I've no desire
for vengeance

691
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,700
For what was
done to me.

692
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:05,600
I have escaped
from the emotions.

693
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:07,100
I am safe
within myself.

694
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:10,100
All I ask and want
is peace and quiet.

695
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,800
Why haven't you
found it?

696
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:16,200
Because people like you
will not let me!

697
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:18,800
Miss birchfield, you
have made the afternoon

698
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,600
Very tedious with
your constant search

699
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:24,700
For an answer.
And one more thing.

700
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:29,400
Please...
stay out of my life.

701
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,400
You shouldn't have
done that.

702
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,600
What's the matter, uncle?

703
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,200
Don't you like wednesdays?

704
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:01,600
You shouldn't
have touched it.

705
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:04,600
Well, it's done.

706
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:07,100
The boss wants you
to sign these.

707
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,100
There'll be no papers
signed today.

708
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,200
Look, maybe you
don't understand.

709
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:12,700
I understand you
perfectly.

710
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,800
I said no papers
signed today.

711
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:18,300
Leave them, but
no papers get signed.
The boss ain't going-

712
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:21,700
I said no papers
get signed today!

713
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:23,900
Ok.

714
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:30,800
You're a tough man,
Mr. Nazerman.

715
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,800
I mean,
he looks tough, but-

716
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,700
Why don't you mind
your own business?

717
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:00,200
You know...

718
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:04,100
You worry me when you look
like that, Mr. Nazerman.

719
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,400
What-what is wrong
with you?

720
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:21,300
Hmm?

721
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:23,800
I don't know.

722
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:28,200
Good afternoon,
Mr. Nazerman.

723
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:31,800
Mr. Nazerman,
for some days now

724
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:35,800
I've been trying
to give an idea

725
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,900
Some sort of shape,
a- a pattern.

726
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,800
Now-now, Mr.- Mr...

727
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:45,300
Socrates...
Socrates himself

728
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:49,300
Was on the very borderline
of drama, right?

729
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:52,800
Right, and look
at Baudelaire.

730
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:56,900
Baudelaire and all his
strange, sacred mysticism.

731
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:59,900
And who knows?
Perhaps the marquis de-

732
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:04,000
Exactly what was it
That you came to pawn,
Mr. Smith?

733
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:06,700
Pawn? Oh, of course.
To pawn.

734
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:10,500
I- I did bring...
I... i...

735
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,400
I had it somewhere.

736
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:16,500
Just stand still.
Stand still
for a minute.

737
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,900
Now, think.

738
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:21,400
Just for once
in your life,

739
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,800
Try to be rational
and think exactly

740
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:27,000
What you came
in here to pawn.

741
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,200
I...

742
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:32,700
Nothing.

743
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:38,400
I had nothing to bring.

744
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,700
I...

745
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:49,600
I will miss
talking to you.

746
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,700
What makes creatures
like that exist?

747
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,900
Why-why did you
call him creature?

748
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,800
Because he's black?

749
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,900
No, not because
he's black.

750
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
I don't care
what he is.

751
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,400
I'm nondiscriminatory,
nonsectarian.

752
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:30,000
Black, white, or yellow,
they're all equally...
Equally what?

753
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:32,000
Scum. Rejects.

754
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:38,600
You're a mighty hard man,
Mr. Nazerman.

755
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:44,600
I mean, after all,
They are
children of god.

756
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:50,000
Ain't they?
You believe
in god, Ortiz?

757
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:53,800
I don't know,
Mr. Nazerman.

758
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,800
But you believe
in god,

759
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,200
And I make book
on that.

760
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:00,800
I do not
believe in god

761
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,800
Or art or science

762
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:05,900
Or newspapers or
politics or philosophy.

763
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:11,800
Well, then,
Mr. Teacher...

764
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:15,000
Ain't there nothing
you do believe?

765
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:17,200
Money.

766
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:21,400
All right.
Then you teach me

767
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,800
About money then,
Mr. Nazerman.

768
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:26,400
All right, Mr. Ortiz.

769
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,900
Now, come here.

770
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:35,800
Firstly, money can increase
or decrease in value.

771
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:38,700
Secondly, money is risky,
but at a given moment,

772
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,800
One has some idea
of its worth.

773
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:44,300
Thirdly, money can
buy you many things-

774
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:45,800
Comfort, luxury,
relief from pain,

775
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:49,800
Sometimes
even life itself,
And now you listen to me,

776
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,600
And you listen
very carefully.

777
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:54,700
Next to the speed of light,
which einstein says

778
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,400
Is the only abSolute
in the universe,

779
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,900
Second only to that,
i rank money!

780
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,300
Well...

781
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:09,800
You believe me, that's
all you need to know.

782
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,700
That's what life's
all about?

783
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:16,300
That's what life
is all about.

784
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:20,100
You mean, money
is the whole thing?

785
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:22,100
Money is
the whole thing.

786
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:36,600
I'll see you later,
Mr. Nazerman.

787
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:02,500
Please, please?
Please, please,
listen to me.

788
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:07,200
Honey, I can get you
the money.

789
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:10,200
I got some gifts
i could sell.

790
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:12,700
Extras from
the customers. You know.

791
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:15,500
Baby, you don't
need them others...

792
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:20,800
Tangee and buck,
most that Robinson-
They just poison.

793
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:27,700
Baby, nothing they do
for you won't hurt you.

794
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:30,300
Oh, please, please,
let me chip in.

795
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:33,700
I can get it for you.
I know I can.

796
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:37,700
Money. Money.

797
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,300
That's the whole thing.
Sure.

798
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:45,200
Sure, honey, only no going
back to them others.

799
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,000
Oh, baby...

800
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:49,500
I'm just
thinkin' of you.

801
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:52,000
Damn loot.
I'm going to get it.

802
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:54,300
I'm going to get it
and fast!

803
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:15,800
Chico! Come. Sit.

804
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,700
How come you don't
join with us?

805
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:30,800
I got some
thinking to do.

806
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:32,700
Oh?

807
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:51,700
You know what I think?
I think you got
something on your mind

808
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:56,600
You want to talk about,
Or you wouldn't be here
in the first place.

809
01:01:56,700 --> 01:02:00,300
You want I should romance you
a little before you talk.

810
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,300
Listen, you hear me,
tangee.

811
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:06,300
I got nothing to say,
see?
I just got to think.

812
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,500
I just got a lot
of thinking to do.

813
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,300
All right.

814
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,600
Ain't nobody
pressuring you.

815
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:17,600
And if-

816
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:20,200
If I decide to do
anything at all,

817
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:22,900
<i>I got to
call the moves.</i>

818
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,600
We had you figured
for that.

819
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:28,200
And if the thing goes,

820
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:32,200
<i>I say if...</i>
There'll be no shooting.

821
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,600
Ok, man.

822
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:36,300
You need a piece,
but just for show,

823
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:41,600
Because shooting
is trouble. It's stupid.
We can do without it.

824
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,700
No matter what,
understand?

825
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:52,300
If I decide
to go ahead with it,

826
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,900
<i>If...</i>
<i>I say when and how.</i>

827
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:58,000
If.

828
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:18,100
I got some stuff
to pawn.

829
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:33,200
We'll start off
with this.

830
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:38,200
That's an expensive locket.
No sense in fooling
around with it. It's gold.

831
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:40,600
I'll give you
$20 for it.

832
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:42,700
$20? It's worth
at least 100.

833
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:45,200
Maybe it is,
but not to me.

834
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,700
This locket was
a present, a gift

835
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:50,200
From a man for
a private session.

836
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:54,200
Pawnbroker... you got it
in your power

837
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:57,200
To make me a beat up
old woman.

838
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:00,800
What makes you say that?

839
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:04,200
'Cause if my boss
finds out

840
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:07,200
I've been messing around
in private-

841
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:10,200
He don't hold still
for nothing like that,

842
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:13,700
So if it was
to get out to him,

843
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:17,500
He'd make me old
before my time.

844
01:04:24,300 --> 01:04:25,600
Hello.

845
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:29,500
Mendel is dead.

846
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:31,900
My father's dead.

847
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:36,200
Did you hear
what I just said?

848
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:40,800
Yeah, I heard
what you said, yeah.

849
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:43,400
Uh...

850
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:44,900
Just a minute.

851
01:04:56,900 --> 01:04:59,300
Hang that up,
would you, please?

852
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:03,300
Hello.

853
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:07,800
Papa is dead.

854
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:10,400
What am I going
to do, Sol?

855
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:15,300
Well, you bury him.
There's nothing else
to do.

856
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:18,300
Nothing?
Nothing. Nothing.

857
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:22,800
When you talk like that,
you're not human.

858
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:25,400
You want me to come
cry with you?

859
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:26,500
Yes.

860
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:28,600
The hell
with your crying.

861
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:32,900
I need someone
to help me.

862
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:37,600
I can't come now.
I can't leave the store.
The store.

863
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:41,300
Big... important... store.

864
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,500
Where do you think
your money comes from?

865
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:44,700
You wouldn't get
your father's corpse

866
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:49,300
Into the ground
if not for the store.

867
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:54,500
Papa is dead.

868
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:57,000
That's what you wanted,
isn't it?

869
01:06:13,800 --> 01:06:15,700
I'm good, pawnbroker.

870
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:19,800
I'm real good.

871
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:25,200
I know things you haven't
never even dreamed about.

872
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:33,400
Just $20 more.

873
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:35,300
I make you happy.

874
01:06:35,300 --> 01:06:37,400
Like you've
never known.

875
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:44,100
I'll show you
how pretty I am.

876
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:56,300
Don't you say nothin'
about this, you hear?

877
01:06:56,300 --> 01:06:59,300
Nothin'. Like I said,

878
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:01,000
If my boss
was to find out

879
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,400
I been messin' around
in private...

880
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:06,800
So don't tell
Rodriguez nothin'.
Rodriguez?

881
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:09,800
Rodriguez...
the big man...

882
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:12,000
The boss.

883
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,900
The biggest in Harlem.

884
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,600
You mean...

885
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,800
You work for Rodriguez?

886
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,500
Oh, yeah.

887
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:26,000
Oh, he's got lots
of irons in the fire.

888
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:27,900
He's a powerful man,

889
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:31,200
So it's better if you
don't tell him a thing.

890
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:36,100
But I got to get me
some money.

891
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:39,900
Look.

892
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:43,900
Look.

893
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:49,100
That's it. Look.

894
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:57,300
Look.

895
01:09:34,900 --> 01:09:37,200
Look.

896
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:42,400
That's it. Look!

897
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,900
It don't cost you
nothin' to look.

898
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:57,100
That's it. Just look.

899
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:01,000
Look.

900
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:12,400
Look.

901
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:55,600
Aah!

902
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:59,400
I can't tell you,
Nazerman,

903
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:01,900
How I've looked
forward to this.

904
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:05,100
People I come
in contact with...

905
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,100
They're dumbheads.

906
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:13,400
You've got background.
The real thing.

907
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:16,900
Me, I never had
a regular education,

908
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:19,900
But I've got
a feel for things.

909
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:21,900
You...

910
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:24,800
Are a welcome
change of pace for me.

911
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,100
Say...

912
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:36,600
If all you wanted was
to come here and stare,

913
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,900
I could've
sent you a picture.

914
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:55,400
Ok, partner...

915
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:57,600
What's your beef?

916
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,700
That whorehouse down
the street from me-
Do you own it?

917
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:02,500
You wouldn't be
trying to get-

918
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:05,200
It's your whorehouse,
isn't it?

919
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:07,100
Assume it is,
then what?

920
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:11,400
I don't want your money
if it's from there.
Say that again.

921
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:14,500
I don't want your money
if it's from there.

922
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:15,900
Why?

923
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:18,900
It's money that comes
from filth and horror!

924
01:12:18,900 --> 01:12:21,400
That's what it is,
professor.

925
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:23,700
Then...

926
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,900
We can have no longer
anything to do further-

927
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:29,200
Professor...

928
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:32,500
You don't know it,
but the lecture is over.

929
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:35,100
Now, you're going
to listen to me.

930
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:36,600
Where do you
think the money

931
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:39,200
You've been living on
comes from, professor?

932
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:43,100
Money you pay for
an old jew's keep,
Money you give Tessie.

933
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:45,700
Money you pay for a nice,
fat house on long island

934
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:48,500
And the nice, fat family
you support there?

935
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:51,300
Oh, I know
all about you.

936
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:55,700
And how. I know where
your money comes from-
From me.

937
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:58,700
And one of the places
i get it most

938
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:02,500
Is from whorehouses
And bowling alleys
and parking lots

939
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:05,100
And hotel linens
and tenements.

940
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:08,800
Now tell me where you thought
it was coming from.

941
01:13:21,400 --> 01:13:23,600
I don't know.

942
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:26,700
That makes you stupid,
professor.

943
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:30,200
You're living right in it!
Right in the middle of
one big whorehouse,

944
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:32,100
Right in the bosom
of the world!

945
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:34,900
How do you say it-
Filth, horror?

946
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:38,400
Right in the middle
and you don't know it.

947
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:41,400
Or maybe something else-
Because you don't want to know.

948
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:44,100
Are you that kind of man,
professor,

949
01:13:44,200 --> 01:13:45,600
That doesn't want
to know about things,

950
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:49,200
Feel about things?
Are you that kind?

951
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:53,300
That makes you nothing!
A ton of nothing!

952
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:59,700
You give me a front,
and I give you money,

953
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:03,400
So don't hang up on me,
professor.

954
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:05,100
Not again.

955
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:09,400
Look at me.

956
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:12,300
Look at me!

957
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:14,000
I said...

958
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:51,200
Those papers
you haven't signed...

959
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:53,600
By tomorrow morning,
signed.

960
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:01,800
What?

961
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:08,900
Yes.

962
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:10,200
Yes?

963
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,300
Yes.

964
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:15,400
Yes?

965
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:21,000
Yes?

966
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:26,900
Yes.

967
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Yes?

968
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:39,000
Yes.

969
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,800
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

970
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:43,400
Oh, yes.

971
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:58,200
Happy dreams, uncle.

972
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:27,700
Come in.

973
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Can I get you
something?

974
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:07,700
Coffee?

975
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:11,500
No, I thank you. No.

976
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:14,500
I was out on the terrace
when you phoned.

977
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:16,100
I couldn't sleep.

978
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:29,000
Would you...
It's very lovely
in the morning.

979
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:34,200
That's why
i got this apartment-

980
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:35,700
This terrace.

981
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:41,500
The city
and the river.

982
01:21:20,300 --> 01:21:24,800
We had a...

983
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:27,100
We had a river
in Germany.

984
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:30,200
Tell me about it.

985
01:21:32,700 --> 01:21:35,200
That was long ago.
That was...

986
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:44,100
That was before Europe
became a graveyard.

987
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:50,700
What made you come here?

988
01:21:53,300 --> 01:21:55,700
I don't know.
I don't know.

989
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:56,900
Just...

990
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:03,000
Things have been
happening lately,
And...

991
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:06,400
I felt I needed
to be with someone.

992
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:10,700
What things,
Mr. Nazerman?

993
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:15,800
Well, it's just
that suddenly,

994
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:19,400
In the last few days,
i feel afraid, and...

995
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:29,800
It's been a long time
since I felt...

996
01:22:29,800 --> 01:22:31,400
Anything.

997
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:32,500
Fear.

998
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:38,900
Fear, fear.
That's what I felt.

999
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:44,900
And then i, uh...

1000
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:49,400
I called you.

1001
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:54,800
I'm sorry that
you're so alone.

1002
01:22:56,300 --> 01:22:58,700
Oh, no, no, no.
You don't understand.

1003
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:01,700
It's just that there
have been memories

1004
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:03,300
That I have...

1005
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:05,700
Well, I thought
that I had...

1006
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:08,200
Pushed them
far away from me,

1007
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:11,100
And they keep
rushing in...

1008
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:13,500
And then
there are words...

1009
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:19,800
Words that I thought I have
kept myself from hearing

1010
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:22,800
And... now...

1011
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:26,600
Now they...

1012
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:29,700
Flood my mind.

1013
01:23:34,500 --> 01:23:35,700
Yeah.

1014
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:40,300
Today is an anniversary.

1015
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,800
What happened?

1016
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:46,100
Happened?

1017
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:47,300
Yes.

1018
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:51,700
I didn't die.

1019
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,500
Everything
that I loved...

1020
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:02,700
Was taken away
from me and...

1021
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:06,500
I did not die.

1022
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:11,300
Mr. Nazerman...

1023
01:24:11,400 --> 01:24:12,800
There was...

1024
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:16,800
Nothing I could do.

1025
01:24:18,800 --> 01:24:19,900
Ha.

1026
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:25,000
Nothing.

1027
01:24:26,600 --> 01:24:28,800
Strange?
I could do nothing.

1028
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,500
No, there was nothing
i could do.

1029
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:51,700
Why do you
sit like that?

1030
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:56,200
I got... chilled.

1031
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,700
I got chilled
listening to you...

1032
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:11,700
And not being able
to do anything for you.

1033
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:11,900
Sol!

1034
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,100
Sol, don't
let him fall!

1035
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:17,700
David?
Sol, he's falling!

1036
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:19,700
Oh, god, David!

1037
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:21,800
Sol! Sol!

1038
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:24,900
Ruthie!
I can't do anything!

1039
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:29,800
Oh, my god,
i can't do nothing.

1040
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:58,000
<i>David. David!</i>

1041
01:29:58,100 --> 01:30:02,800
<i>David! David!</i>

1042
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:58,000
Mr. Nazerman.

1043
01:31:00,700 --> 01:31:04,300
Mr. Nazerman.
Are you all right?

1044
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:08,300
You-you don't
look good.

1045
01:31:16,900 --> 01:31:18,900
Listen, i...

1046
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,200
I- is there
anything I can...

1047
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:25,500
Mr. Nazerman.

1048
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:31,800
Do you remember me?

1049
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:40,700
The Oratory Award.

1050
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:47,500
Just to carry me over
until i...

1051
01:32:47,500 --> 01:32:50,100
Well... I have this
for you.

1052
01:32:56,700 --> 01:32:58,400
Don't scratch them.

1053
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:06,500
They're surely
worth $10.

1054
01:33:18,700 --> 01:33:20,900
$50.

1055
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:24,400
$2.00.
You're crazy.

1056
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:25,900
$2.00 for
a leica camera?

1057
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:27,900
What the hell
are you saying?

1058
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:29,400
$1.00.
That's better?

1059
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:31,800
You're out of
your mind for sure.

1060
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:37,600
Whatever you
want to give.

1061
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:40,000
I've got no use
for them anymore.

1062
01:33:40,100 --> 01:33:42,500
How much do you
want to borrow?

1063
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:45,100
Oh, I-I don't know.

1064
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:47,100
$20?

1065
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:48,300
$50.

1066
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:52,200
I'll let you
have it for $2.00.

1067
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:54,700
Why, yes, I'll just
take that watch.

1068
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:57,600
Now, just
wait a minute.

1069
01:33:57,700 --> 01:34:02,000
This says, uh...
It says
121/2 bucks, lady.

1070
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,000
You got a mouth, boy.
Pawnbroker says-

1071
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
I don't care.
You want this article,

1072
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:10,900
You come up with $12.50.
That's what the sign say.

1073
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:17,400
Mr. Nazerman.

1074
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:24,600
Mr. Nazerman,
are you ok? Huh?

1075
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:26,300
Leave me alone,
Ortiz.

1076
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:28,800
Ok, I'll do that,
Mr. Nazerman.

1077
01:34:28,900 --> 01:34:31,800
I'll do that.
First I want to know,

1078
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:33,300
Are you ok?

1079
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:35,000
I'm ok.

1080
01:34:35,100 --> 01:34:36,500
Are you sure?

1081
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:38,500
Yes, I'm sure!
I'm ok.

1082
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:41,500
Now just
leave me alone.
That's all right.

1083
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:43,500
I'm just concerned,
that's all.

1084
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:46,200
After all,
you're my teacher.

1085
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:52,500
Ha.
I'm your what?

1086
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:54,800
You're my teacher.

1087
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:56,000
Hmm.

1088
01:34:56,100 --> 01:34:58,400
I'm a student to you.

1089
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:00,800
You're
nothing to me.

1090
01:35:05,100 --> 01:35:07,000
For true?
For true.

1091
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:09,000
You mean, I'm like...

1092
01:35:09,100 --> 01:35:12,200
The rest of them
out there?
That's right.

1093
01:35:12,200 --> 01:35:16,100
You're like the rest
of them out there.
You're nothing to me.

1094
01:35:19,300 --> 01:35:23,200
I'll go for lunch now.
Go to lunch.
Do what you please,

1095
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:25,700
But just leave me alone.
Now, go!

1096
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:34,800
See you later.

1097
01:37:05,900 --> 01:37:08,500
It's at
closing time.
Hmm?

1098
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:11,100
I said it's
at closing time.

1099
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:12,700
How come?

1100
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,400
That's when
it's got to be.

1101
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:19,000
Now I said it,

1102
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,300
And I'm
saying it again.

1103
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:23,400
No shootin'.

1104
01:37:23,500 --> 01:37:28,000
What's the matter,
You worried
about the jew?

1105
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:29,700
No.

1106
01:37:29,700 --> 01:37:34,200
I'm worrying about
Jesus Ortiz.

1107
01:37:34,300 --> 01:37:37,900
Now...

1108
01:37:37,900 --> 01:37:39,400
I got a plan.

1109
01:38:44,600 --> 01:38:47,000
Then this jive cop,
he said,

1110
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:48,500
"Mon,
I'm sympathetic

1111
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:50,900
To the problems
of your race."

1112
01:39:00,500 --> 01:39:05,000
You were supposed to deliver
the papers this morning.
They better be signed.

1113
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:22,500
Sign them.

1114
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:45,700
And if I don't
sign the papers...

1115
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:50,400
What do you do to me
then, you kill me?

1116
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:52,500
Oh, yes.

1117
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:55,800
So kill me.

1118
01:39:57,600 --> 01:39:59,200
Pardon me, uncle.

1119
01:40:33,100 --> 01:40:34,700
Professor...

1120
01:40:38,100 --> 01:40:41,100
You have to kill me.

1121
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:46,300
That's what you want.

1122
01:40:50,300 --> 01:40:53,800
That's what you really want,
professor, isn't it?

1123
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:59,400
I'll tell you what.
You'll die...

1124
01:41:00,900 --> 01:41:03,700
But not when
you want to.

1125
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:06,900
Not when you
want to so bad.

1126
01:41:08,500 --> 01:41:10,800
One day it'll
happen to you...

1127
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,700
Just the time when
you wish it hadn't.

1128
01:41:52,100 --> 01:41:55,600
I'd like to borrow
some money on this.

1129
01:41:57,100 --> 01:42:00,700
I- I want to borrow
$10 on this.

1130
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:02,900
I collect them.

1131
01:42:02,900 --> 01:42:05,400
You'd be surprised
how many people

1132
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:07,500
Use them for decoration.

1133
01:42:09,100 --> 01:42:14,600
There's a monarch
in here.

1134
01:42:14,700 --> 01:42:18,300
And the great spangle
fritillary.

1135
01:42:20,300 --> 01:42:22,100
The mourning cloak...

1136
01:42:22,900 --> 01:42:24,400
And...

1137
01:42:24,500 --> 01:42:28,700
The one with
the eye design, tha-

1138
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:38,700
Thank you.

1139
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:34,700
Well, gentlemen,
what do you want?
The money.

1140
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:37,600
The money.

1141
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:41,300
Now, we ain't playin'.

1142
01:45:42,500 --> 01:45:44,800
Now you open
that safe fast.

1143
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:47,000
Well, come on!

1144
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:49,700
Well, come on!

1145
01:46:01,400 --> 01:46:02,700
Look...

1146
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:06,900
Go home.

1147
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:12,500
We ain't jokin', mister.
You get that money
out of that safe.

1148
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:13,900
You get it.

1149
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:15,900
Hey, no sweat.
It's open.

1150
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:18,900
Step aside, uncle.

1151
01:46:27,700 --> 01:46:30,000
What do you want
to die for, uncle?

1152
01:46:30,100 --> 01:46:34,300
The money don't mean
that much to you, does it?

1153
01:46:38,400 --> 01:46:42,300
Now... you move.

1154
01:46:44,100 --> 01:46:48,300
Get out of the way
of that safe-
No shooting!

1155
01:47:34,100 --> 01:47:35,900
Back up!
Back up!

1156
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:23,700
Jesus!

1157
01:48:28,700 --> 01:48:31,800
Jesus! Jesus!

1158
01:48:31,900 --> 01:48:33,800
Jesus!

1159
01:48:33,900 --> 01:48:36,900
<i>Ay, ay, ay!
Dios mio!</i>

1160
01:49:20,500 --> 01:49:23,300
I... I said no shootin'.

1161
01:49:25,400 --> 01:49:28,400
I said no...
not to hurt you.

1162
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:29,400
No...

1163
01:49:29,400 --> 01:49:31,100
No, don't hurt you.

1164
01:49:31,200 --> 01:49:32,800
No.

1165
01:49:32,900 --> 01:49:34,600
No, don't hurt you!

1166
01:50:51,000 --> 01:50:54,100
Back it up,
back it up!
Let's go!
