Huh? Come on over here.
Let's sit with Mr. Hollingworth.

00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:51,084
<i>This is our indoor therapy pool. You'll probably
be doing most of your work in here.</i>

8

None of our patients
can really stand the sun. Millie.

9
00:04:54,591 --> 00:04:56,559
Yes, Miss Bunweill?

10
00:04:58,295 --> 00:05:00,991
- This is Pinky Rose. She'll be starting with us today.
- Hi.

11
00:05:01,098 --> 00:05:03,828
- Hi.
- I want you to get her a suit and a locker...

12
00:05:03,934 --> 00:05:05,902
<i>and show her the routine
the way you did with Alcira.</i>

Okay, but I got Mr. Shaw
for after lunch.

14
00:05:08,438 --> 00:05:11,236
Peggy can take over for you.
Millie's one of our best girls.

15
00:05:11,341 --> 00:05:13,536
- She'll show you how simple it really is.
- Okay.

16
00:05:13,643 --> 00:05:15,508
Okay, after lunch.

17
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,013
<i>- What'll I do till then?
- You can have lunch in the café...</i>

18

Yep.

You can cook a hot dog

<i>- [Millie] Do you guys know how to play Scrabble?
- [Woman #2] No.</i>

44
00:07:24,307 --> 00:07:27,538
<i>It's a real good game.
You can learn a lot of new words.</i>

<i>- Well, they say they want a receptionist.

was "zebus."

<i>- You know what zebus are?

I didn't like the guy that I was with
too much, though.

56
00:07:55,605 --> 00:07:58,506
All he wanted to do
was make up dirty words.

57
00:07:58,608 --> 00:08:00,599
We weren't gonna play
that way.

58
00:08:01,945 --> 00:08:03,913
- You know what we had for dinner?
- What'd you have?

59
00:08:04,014 --> 00:08:05,982
<i>Tuna casserole.

60
00:08:06,082 --> 00:08:08,607
<i>- [Woman #1] Was it any good?
- Yeah.</i>

61
00:08:08,718 --> 00:08:13,212
<i>I got this whole book of recipes that I'm keepin'.
And I list 'em by how long they take to make.</i>

62
00:08:13,323 --> 00:08:16,417
You know, if you only have 20 minutes,
you just look under 20 minutes...

63
00:08:16,526 --> 00:08:19,893
and it tells ya all the kind of things
that you can make in that amount of time.

64
00:08:19,996 --> 00:08:21,896
<i>[Woman #1]

It's real good.

66
00:08:25,302 --> 00:08:28,669
It's really not a book,
but a kind of file with times marked on it.

<i>You don't say.</i>

Oh, um —
Polly, this is Pinky.

70
00:08:37,847 --> 00:08:39,747

<i>- Hi, Millie.

- Yeah.

73
00:08:44,454 --> 00:08:47,287
- Okay, let's go get you a suit that fits.
- Okay.

74
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,820
You ever worked
in these kind of places before?

75
00:08:50,927 --> 00:08:53,088
No. This is my first job
in California.

76
00:08:53,196 --> 00:08:56,859
They're not very big
with the salaries here. Oof.

77
00:08:56,967 --> 00:08:59,697
- You're a little like me, aren't ya?
- Yeah.

78
00:09:00,971 --> 00:09:04,372
This looks like
it's about as best as we can do.

79
00:09:04,474 --> 00:09:08,274
- Why don't you put this on? I'll wait for you outside.
- Okay.

80
00:09:12,048 --> 00:09:15,745
After you've checked the list in the morning,
you'll know who you're supposed to have.

81
00:09:15,852 --> 00:09:18,980
There'll be a time
written right by each name.

82
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:22,456
You'll meet 'em here
and they'll give you their cards.

83
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,861
Okay, suppose you got Mr. Shaw and it says,
on his card, uh, "Mineral pool and rest."

84
00:09:27,964 --> 00:09:30,432
Well, you get him
to enter the water right away.

85
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:33,400
Ten minutes is the max, though,
like it says on that wall.

86
00:09:33,503 --> 00:09:37,303
<i>Then you get him out,
wrap him up and put him on a chaise lounge...</i>

87
00:09:37,407 --> 00:09:42,003
<i>and he's gotta stay there for at least 20 minutes
before he can go back in.</i>

88
00:09:42,112 --> 00:09:44,239
Now, you're gonna
play the patient...

89
00:09:44,347 --> 00:09:46,247
and I'm gonna take ya in.

90
00:09:46,349 --> 00:09:48,817
<i>First we gotta take off
our robes and our shoes.</i>

91
00:09:48,918 --> 00:09:53,651
[Softly]
Okay. Robe. Take off our shoes.

92
00:09:53,757 --> 00:09:57,193
Okay, now,

<i>- My bathing suit's too big?
- No.</i>

95
00:10:06,569 --> 00:10:11,768
I mean, why else would you be here if it weren't
somethin' like your legs or your arms or—

96
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,775
<i>There's gotta be
somethin'wrong with ya.</i>

97
00:10:13,877 --> 00:10:16,402
Oh, my back!
Oh, my back.

98
00:10:16,513 --> 00:10:20,950
<i>- And my leg. My leg. My leg hurts.
- Okay, your back and your legs.</i>

99
00:10:21,051 --> 00:10:24,714
- This is for people with bad backs and legs.
- [Groaning] Thank you.

100
00:10:24,821 --> 00:10:29,884
- Now, you're gonna have to take it real slow and easy now.
- Okay. [Groans]

101
00:10:29,993 --> 00:10:33,360
- We don't want you to get hurt.
- Okay.

102
00:10:34,698 --> 00:10:39,726
- Just be careful 'cause it's real slippery.
- Okay.

103
00:10:39,836 --> 00:10:44,102
- [Groaning]
- Just take it easy.

104
00:10:47,677 --> 00:10:51,238
- Okay.
- Doesn't that feel good?

105
00:10:51,348 --> 00:10:53,441
Mm-hmm.

106
00:10:55,819 --> 00:10:58,913

<i>It's 106º.</i>

108

<i>You know, my grandmother had
a bad back and leg, too.</i>

109
00:11:04,961 --> 00:11:06,895
<i>- She did?
- Yeah.</i>

110
00:11:11,601 --> 00:11:15,298
Okay, now, do you wanna stoop
and get all the way in?

111
00:11:15,405 --> 00:11:17,737
I don't know.
Am I supposed to?

112
00:11:17,841 --> 00:11:21,242
- Not you. That's what you're supposed to ask them.
- Oh.

113
00:11:21,344 --> 00:11:23,574
- You have to kind of humor 'em.
- Oh.

114
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,911
- Sort of talk 'em into what they're supposed to do.
- Yeah.

115
00:11:27,016 --> 00:11:30,952
Okay, now, follow me.

116
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:43,427
[Sighs]
I don't believe it.

117
00:11:43,533 --> 00:11:48,732
- If Bunweill had seen that you'd be in hot trouble.
- You said all the way.

118
00:11:48,838 --> 00:11:53,468
Well, now let's go do
some exercises over here.

119
00:11:53,576 --> 00:11:56,374
- It's okay.
- [Gasping]

120
00:11:57,881 --> 00:12:00,816
Now we're gonna exercise
these hurt legs.

121
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:19,899
What's the matter?
Haven't ya ever seen twins before?

<i>[Woman Chattering]</i>

<i>[Millie] These are our individual hot tubs. The

And over here
ya got your rest area.

125
00:12:35,285 --> 00:12:39,221
They probably won't let ya work the tubs
until you've been here a week or two.

126
00:12:39,322 --> 00:12:41,256
There's really
nothin' to it...

127

but ya just gotta know
when somebody's gettin' a bad reaction.

128
00:12:44,828 --> 00:12:50,095
Sometimes they can't get out by themselves,
and if you leave 'em in too long they could die.

129
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,168
- They could die?
- Yeah. Uh-oh.

Oh, Graham,
I don't know how that happened.

132
00:12:56,806 --> 00:12:58,774
Took her blood pressure
and she was fine.

but I couldn't.

1312
02:01:04,087 --> 02:01:06,783
All right, you two.
Time to come inside.

1313
02:01:10,427 --> 02:01:12,395
Okay.

1314
02:01:20,337 --> 02:01:22,396
<i>[Willie]
Oh. Damn skirt.</i>

1315
02:01:24,441 --> 02:01:27,239
<i>[Millie]
I'll fix that for you.</i>

1316
02:01:27,344 --> 02:01:29,744
<i>Millie, get my sewing basket.</i>

1317
02:01:31,014 --> 02:01:33,244
<i>[Pinky]
Yes, ma'am.</i>

1318
02:01:33,350 --> 02:01:35,318
<i>Where is it?</i>

1319
02:01:36,453 --> 02:01:38,921
<i>[Millie]
You know where it is.</i>

1320
02:01:39,022 --> 02:01:41,149
<i>[Pinky]
Okay.</i>

1321
02:01:42,859 --> 02:01:45,760
<i>[Millie]
And wash those potatoes for me.</i>

1322
02:01:45,862 --> 02:01:48,592
<i>[Pinky]
Yes, ma'am.</i>

1323
02:01:48,698 --> 02:01:50,598
<i>All of them?</i>

1324
02:01:52,035 --> 02:01:54,094
<i>[Millie]
All of them.</i>

1325
02:01:55,305 --> 02:01:57,432
<i>And put them in the pot.</i>

1326
02:02:00,310 --> 02:02:02,278
<i>[Pinky]
This pot?</i>

1327
02:02:04,481 --> 02:02:06,449
<i>[Millie]
I'm not gonna answer that.</i>

1328
02:02:07,751 --> 02:02:10,549
<i>[Pinky]
Yes, ma'am.</i>

1329
02:02:10,653 --> 02:02:13,952
<i>[Willie]
Don't know why you have to be so mean to her.</i>
