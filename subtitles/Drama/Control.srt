1
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,560
Under power of the State,
I am hereby authorized to put you...

2
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,560
Lee Ray Oliver,
to death by lethal injection.

3
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,839
Is there anything
you'd like to say?

4
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,879
Fuck you!

5
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,679
Fuck every last one of you!

6
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,180
Fuck you!

7
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,580
Cover that up, please.

8
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,660
Let's get the bag open.

9
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,380
Thank you.

10
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,860
- Where am I?
- You're in the County Morgue, Lee Ray.

11
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,340
I'm not dead.

12
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,760
The injections you got were all
saltwater except the anaesthetic.

13
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,400
- What the fuck is going on?
- You're getting an opportunity...

14
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,280
to be part of a medical
research project.

15
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,879
If you agree to participate
in the experiment...

16
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,120
I'll take you toe tag here put
it on that body over there.

17
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,280
He'll be cremated,
you'll go on with these gentlemen.

18
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,440
If you don't agree the doctor will
inject you with sodium pentathol...

19
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,280
and the execution will proceed
right now in this room.

20
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,039
What kind of experiment?

21
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,880
It's a behaviour
modifying drug trial.

22
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,360
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm a neuropharmacologist.

23
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,560
I'm involved in the research
and development of new drugs.

24
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,840
- I like drugs!
- The drug we're going to give you...

25
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,800
is not a narcotic. It won't
give you narcotic sensations.

26
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,760
And there may be side effects.
Some severe, possibly fatal.

27
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,440
- You want me to be a guinea pig?
- No, you'll be a test subject.

28
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,380
You have 1 minute
to make your decision.

29
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,220
Fuck you, Warden!

30
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,599
Proceed.

31
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,240
This is your last chance to do
something good in your life.

32
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,940
A chance to give something
back to society.

33
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,560
Fuck society! What the fuck
has society ever done for me?

34
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,300
Doctor!

35
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,820
Just wait!

36
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,720
Wherever we're going I hope it
smells better that it did in there.

37
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,980
Let's go.

38
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,340
You greedy fuck!

39
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,800
So now you see how it goes.

40
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,460
Every time I say fuck...

41
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,040
he does that!
Because you, Warden...

42
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,820
have a lot of fucking nerve!

43
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,740
You thought you're gonna
get another one, didn't you?

44
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,000
But I said fucking, not fuck.

45
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,040
- Please, stop!
- Didn't I pay you well...

46
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,120
to let my men go after
Lee Ray in prison?

47
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:06,280
When Lee Ray offered him instead,
did I complain? No.

48
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,380
I didn't give a flying fuck!

49
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,800
I found out the State was gonna
execute him. So I am satisfied.

50
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,160
But now you tell me that
Lee Ray is actually alive...

51
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,679
and that you will find
out where he is...

52
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,180
if I pay you?

53
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,140
I'm sorry,
I'll do it for free. It's fair!

54
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,000
You'll find him, and we'll kill him.

55
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,159
Third time's the charm, right?

56
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,880
Yes, Mr. Vertov. Third time's the...

57
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,620
Don't fuck up!

58
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,200
You'll start off by taking
one pill every six hours.

59
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,260
Wait a fucking minute!
Wait a minute.

60
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,839
What's this pill gonna do?

61
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,240
My name is Dr. Copeland. I designed
the medication you'll be taking.

62
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,360
It's called Anagress. It works by
altering the brain's chemistry...

63
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,440
by suppressing your violent tendencies.
And with you aggression reduced...

64
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,280
you'll begin to experience feelings
of good will and compassion...

65
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,640
a sense of right and wrong,
even remorse over past mistakes.

66
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,200
- Good fucking luck.
- This is the first time Anagress...

67
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,680
has been tried on humans. We don't
know what the side effects are.

68
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,280
Hopefully they're minor:
Dry mouth, dizziness, nausea...

69
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,180
but there is a chance they
could be more severe.

70
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,159
Like what?

71
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,680
Liver failure, brain seizures...

72
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,039
...a stroke...
- Whatever.

73
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,999
Years ago, they might have
given you a lobotomy...

74
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,080
carved out a piece of your brain
like a rotten part of an apple.

75
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,560
But today we're more civilized.
We do it biochemically.

76
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,200
I rather have a bottle in front
of me than a frontal lobotomy!

77
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,860
How long is your little
experiment gonna last?

78
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,600
It's never over.
You and the other 19 test subjects...

79
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,360
will be observed indefinitely.

80
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,279
That' one pill every six hours.

81
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,780
Open wide.

82
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,020
Let's go.

83
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,620
Open back up.

84
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,740
Smart man.

85
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,440
- Hey, Michael! How you doing?
- Good. I'm doing good.

86
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,079
Excellent.

87
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,959
Is that Austin?

88
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,460
He scored two goals
in the first half.

89
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,280
- He's getting real tall.
- They grow up so fast, don't they?

90
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,620
Ah, jeez!

91
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,839
I just came to see
how the team was doing.

92
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,340
We're doing good.

93
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,760
- It's not the same, but...
- No. Nothing is.

94
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,460
Yes!

95
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:04,280
The guy seems a real teddy bear.
Two days and not a peep.

96
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,999
I want blood,
urine and saliva samples.

97
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,799
I have a PET scan and
SPECT scheduled.

98
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,119
Add a cerebral spinal
fluid analysis.

99
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,620
Yes, doctor.

100
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,759
Mr. Oliver...

101
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,260
we're going to remove
your last restraint.

102
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,559
I want you to relax.

103
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,639
I just died and live
to talk about it.

104
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,140
It doesn't get more
relaxed than this.

105
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,900
Is it all right
if I smoke in here?

106
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,980
We have a security breach.

107
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,500
I repeat,
we have a security breach.

108
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,940
Go!

109
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,100
We got him!

110
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,520
- The man is a fucking animal.
- He's perfect!

111
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,100
Hey, Aiku!

112
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,860
- Shit!
- Zone 8 activated.

113
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,940
- Zone 8 activated.
- Aiku!

114
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,279
- Hello.
- There you are!

115
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,160
I've been looking for you everywhere.
You've changed the code again.

116
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,880
I'm sorry. We agreed you were
gonna call before you came by.

117
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,559
It's my weekend.
You knew I was coming by.

118
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,440
- I forgot. I'm sorry.
- How unusual!

119
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,320
Hello, Aiku!
How are you?

120
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:54,360
- What happened? You look terrible!
- It was a rough day at the office.

121
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,260
You look terrific, by the way.

122
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,040
I got a call from Jenny. She said
you showed up at the soccer match.

123
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,319
- That was fast!
- She was worried about you.

124
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,479
And I'm worried about you too.

125
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,000
I just wanted do feel
what it was like to...

126
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,060
be there again.

127
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,060
- I hurt too, you know.
- I know.

128
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,640
- That's why I've gotta go.
- I know that too.

129
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:30,480
Come on. Time to go to mom's house.
Next time I call before I come.

130
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,140
- All right.
- Come on!

131
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,780
You never told me your
ex was so beautiful.

132
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,660
- How long have you been here?
- Not long.

133
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,180
I was just in the pool
and I saw her drive up.

134
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:55,560
It wouldn't be a brilliant idea for me
to be towelling off in the living room.

135
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,160
I went upstairs and
hid in your closet.

136
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,959
How's your jaw?

137
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,460
The truth?

138
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:12,320
- I'm gonna make you feel better.
- Make me forget everything.

139
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,860
Can you do that for me?

140
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,780
I can try.

141
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,640
- What the hell is going on?
- Take the pill first.

142
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,300
Where's my hair?
Where's my tattoos?

143
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,020
Erased. Like your past.

144
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,400
In the next few weeks we'll be
making changes on your outside...

145
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,399
while the medication
changes you on the inside.

146
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,400
After what you guys did to me, you
guys should be taking these pills!

147
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,300
OK, but you first.

148
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,060
Attaboy.

149
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,240
The guy is pretty good.
Beat my high score.

150
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,220
Seratonine metabolate levels?

151
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,959
Barely registering.

152
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,319
The guy is a textbook sociopath.

153
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,280
Is it true he stabbed an inmate
in the eye with a screwdriver?

154
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,060
Yes. He goes for the head.

155
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,460
- Increase game difficulty.
- Ok.

156
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,980
Let's crank it up to mach 5.

157
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,720
- How'd he do with his MMPI?
- Just what you'd expect from...

158
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,039
a guy with antisocial
personality disorder...

159
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,800
...with psychotic tendencies.
- And that's just for starters.

160
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,159
Your fucking thing is rigged!

161
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,559
You can't hit a thing!

162
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,060
Fuck!

163
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,460
This fucking thing is rigged!

164
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,239
Get the fuck...

165
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,479
Get the fuck...
thing is rigged!

166
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,000
This thing is fucked up!
It's a broken machine!

167
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,439
Get the fuck outta here!

168
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,940
Fix your fucking machine!

169
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,719
There goes 10 grand.

170
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,220
Take it out of my paycheck.

171
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,239
Nikolai Vertov. 27 years old.

172
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,740
Do you ever feel bad
about taking his life?

173
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,960
- Bad? I feel really bad.
- You do? Tell me.

174
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,920
If I'd known the motherfucker was
the nephew of a Russian mobster...

175
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,360
I never would've robbed him, let
alone put a bullet through his head.

176
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,060
Manoel Jose Gutierrez.

177
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,860
- You ever been in prison, Doc?
- Let's not get distracted.

178
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,520
I didn't think so. It's probably
not what you're exactly used to.

179
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,640
The Russian mobster took a contract
out on me for killing his nephew.

180
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,680
Gutierrez here tried to
cash in on that contract.

181
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,679
I just defended myself.

182
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:53,960
- You felt justified in...
- I felt fucking justified!

183
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,120
I don't give a fuck if you believe
me or not! That's what happened.

184
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,360
I got the jump on him,
he's dead, I'm alive.

185
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,620
Gary David Caputo.

186
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,580
We got a minor bump.

187
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,679
He's alive.

188
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:21,080
- Just a little worse for wear.
- Tell me what happened with him.

189
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,200
Just wrong place, wrong time.
It's not my problem.

190
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,640
You threatened to kill his brother
for testifying at the trial.

191
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,960
- Is that true?
- Are we done? This is getting boring.

192
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,680
You were 12 years old
when your mother died?

193
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,960
- You know exactly how old I was!
- These files have discrepancies.

194
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,200
I just wanna make sure I get it right.
A former boyfriend killed her...

195
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,639
and you witnessed the murder.
Is that true?

196
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,140
Just give me the drugs
and let's get on with it.

197
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,660
You never said anything about
answering any of these questions!

198
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:55,440
- Just answer the question.
- I'll answer whatever I want!

199
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,400
And don't you go talking to
me like that. I'm not your kid!

200
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,520
If you don't answer the question,
you're of no use to me.

201
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,360
I'll transfer you back to the
custody of the warden right now.

202
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,340
You are only alive because of me.

203
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,480
Why don't you answer the questions,
so I can help you?

204
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,999
I was 10...

205
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,479
not 12.

206
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,279
I was 10.

207
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,199
Thank you.

208
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,700
Yes, I saw her
thrashing around.

209
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,660
I saw the whole
goddamn thing.

210
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,040
And then the fuck who killed
her took a piss in front of me.

211
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,240
Then he turned around and said:
"When you got to go...

212
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,759
you got to go".

213
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,260
You wanna hear about what my
uncle John used to do with me?

214
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,060
He had a little hobby
that he called golf.

215
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,580
He used to beat me with his
driver every Tuesday night.

216
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,520
Write that down. Why don't you
write a fucking book about it?

217
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,640
- All right, that's enough for today.
- It is e-fucking-nough!

218
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,380
I'm everything you hate
in the world, huh, Doc?

219
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,520
He's more at ease.
Much less agitated.

220
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:59,080
Five of the rhesus monkeys showed
results after only three doses.

221
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,720
- When is his next PET scan?
- "Mañana".

222
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,980
Let's do it now.

223
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,700
- Hey, Doc!
- How ya doin'?

224
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:21,080
I'm actually doing really good!
It's strange. I feel... different.

225
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:26,160
Everything seems clearer,
I feel less wound up.

226
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,799
Good.

227
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,960
- Shit... it really works.
- We just got to do...

228
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,900
Come here!

229
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,799
Everybody, get away!

230
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,799
Nobody move! Back up!

231
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,300
I'm gonna stick this
pen in his eye!

232
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,439
Put the fucking guns down!

233
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,940
- Get away!
- Put it down!

234
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,399
- So what he says!
- Put the gun down!

235
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,439
- Help me outta here, Doc.
- I will!

236
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,999
Put'em down!

237
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,199
Put the guns down!

238
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,239
Get away! Put the guns down!

239
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,740
Put it down!

240
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,660
I swear to fucking Christ
it's going in his eye!

241
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,480
Tell him to put the gun down.

242
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,919
- Do as he says.
- Get outta here!

243
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,420
Tell me how to get outta here!

244
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,060
Tell me how to get outta here!

245
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,820
We'll take it from here.

246
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,380
Get the fuck... jeez...

247
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,999
You're just as fucked
up as I am, Doc.

248
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,920
You got a fancy suit...
You're just as fucked up as I am.

249
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,760
You're just as fucked up.
Get off of me!

250
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,279
Jesus, are you okay.

251
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,780
Increase the dosage.
8 milligrams three times a day.

252
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,519
That's more than 3 times
the previous.

253
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,020
Just do it.

254
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,599
Hart-Mercer Pharmaceuticals...

255
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,960
dedicated to making the world
a happier, healthier place.

256
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,400
Now and in years ahead,
we will continue our...

257
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,959
You are too involved.
There's a reason why they...

258
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,400
don't want a primary researcher
conducting his own clinical trial.

259
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,360
The man is out of control. Unsuitable.
We'll find another one.

260
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,240
We have to give him more time.
I'm increasing the dosage.

261
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,760
If you don't like it, you can hand
my resignation in to the board.

262
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:33,160
Be careful. If one threatens to
resign one time too many...

263
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,919
they get taken up on it.

264
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,920
And now, ladies and gentlemen, Senior
V.P. Of Research and Development...

265
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,700
Dr. Arlo Penner.

266
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,479
Thank you.

267
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,960
Not too long ago, the acronym
SSRI was virtually unheard of.

268
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,200
Now, of course, Selective
Seratonin Reuptake Inhibitors...

269
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,960
help millions of people
lead better lives.

270
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,879
Today, as we speak...

271
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,920
a new class of pharmaceuticals
is being developed...

272
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,440
that has the potential to
change society as we know it.

273
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,560
As you're probably aware,
the reason why Hart-Mercer stock...

274
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,560
remains strong within this
volatile market sector...

275
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,839
is largely because of Dynax.

276
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,720
And I'm pleased to be able
to announce to you that...

277
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,159
Dynax has once again
been named...

278
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,160
as this year's most
prescribed anti-depressant.

279
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,340
So, on behalf of...

280
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,920
the board of directors and the
shareholders of Hart-Mercer...

281
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,720
I wanna thank you,
Dr. Michael Copeland...

282
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:56,280
for your groundbreaking work
which continues to this day.

283
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,700
- Congratulations, doctor.
- Thanks.

284
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,840
- You look surprised to see me.
- Maybe a little.

285
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,439
Did you forget that
I'm a shareholder?

286
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,879
Made us both rich.

287
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,380
As you keep climbing the ladder,
don't forget to count the rungs.

288
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,319
Remember when all we wanted
was that one bedroom house?

289
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,239
With our very own washer and dryer.

290
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,920
- And I was gonna open up a center...
- Stop. You're making me feel old.

291
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,460
- How are you?
- I'm good.

292
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,020
- Congratulations, doctor.
- Thanks.

293
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:45,040
Barbara, this is Eden Ross.
She's a post-doc. Part of the team.

294
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,519
- Nice to meet you.
- My pleasure.

295
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,239
When I was an undergrad...

296
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,840
I read your paper on the educational
deficits effect on family violence.

297
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,740
- It was really brilliant.
- Thanks.

298
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,880
Now I officially do feel old.
Next time invent a pill for that. Bye.

299
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,380
- Nice seeing ya.
- Bye.

300
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,240
- So am I gonna see you tonight?
- I hope so.

301
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,340
Are you buying a car?

302
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,840
- Tuesday! Must be beef stew.
- I wouldn't be too sure.

303
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,500
I'm sorry, Lee Ray.

304
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,180
It's all right. It's cool.
No sweat.

305
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,540
I'll get something to clean it up.

306
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,180
- He didn't hit me.
- I could've made that accident...

307
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,479
more natural.

308
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,960
- This is very good, gentlemen.
- I did a decent Yago, senior year.

309
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,880
- Who the hell is Yago?
- We've got his MAO level.

310
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,580
Lambda K three is point one four.

311
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,060
This is your last chance to do
something good in your life.

312
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,820
OK. I'll be right there.

313
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,780
- Who was it?
- Security.

314
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,580
I'll go with you.

315
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:25,880
Come on, man, just chill.
It's all right.

316
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,420
No, it's not.

317
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,240
- I'm gonna be sick again.
- Take a deep breath.

318
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,020
What's going on?

319
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,919
What's going on?

320
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,120
- I can see his face.
- Whose face?

321
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,620
Gary Caputo's.

322
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,599
Wrong time, wrong place.

323
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,080
He was just standing on the
stairs with a bag of groceries.

324
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:58,640
I should've just ran by, passed him
and just gotten the hell outta there.

325
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,000
It's OK.

326
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,740
He was in a coma
for seven months.

327
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,840
He had to learn to do
everything all over again.

328
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,520
When I was in prison,
I used to joke about him.

329
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:32,400
I used to brag about how
I made the guy into a vegetable.

330
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,520
What's important is you know
that what you did is wrong.

331
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,100
The treatment is working.

332
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,060
- It's working.
- Why can't I sleep?

333
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,440
I wanna put my head on my pillow...

334
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,560
close my eyes and not
see his face anymore.

335
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,980
It's gonna be OK.

336
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,679
We'll give him Somnubel.
5 milligrams.

337
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,920
Brock, that's two tablets
whenever he can't sleep.

338
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,020
Ladies and gentlemen...

339
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:12,020
we've got remorse.

340
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,399
How can we be sure
he's not faking again?

341
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,359
All of his biomarkers back it up.

342
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:20,600
Ever since week 5 his serotonin
and MAO levels have improved...

343
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,079
limbic and amygdale activity...

344
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,240
as well as BFS measures
have responded in kind.

345
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:30,080
I think we're ready for Phase 2.

346
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,240
Are you sure? The board
and I both believe that is...

347
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,940
absolutely your call.

348
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,280
But we all know the risks involved
in moving forward too quickly.

349
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:48,240
It's going to work. I think that
we've uncreated a monster.

350
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,800
- Lot more cell phones!
- Tell me about it.

351
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,640
- This thing is tight.
- You'll get used to it.

352
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,119
The only way that truly gauge...

353
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,240
the effects of Anagress is to
observe you in the real world.

354
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,220
A controlled environment
can only tell us so much.

355
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,740
I haven't been on the
outside in a long time.

356
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,800
- What if I fall on my ass?
- You get back up.

357
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,799
This is it?

358
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,920
- I thought you were made of money.
- Beats your last address.

359
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,620
That's fine, guys.

360
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,679
- Thanks.
- Let's do it again.

361
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,039
- What's your name?
- Joe Monroe.

362
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,680
And what have you been
doing for the last 5 years?

363
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,740
Working in Cincinnati, Ohio,
in a packaging plant.

364
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,039
- Loading boxes in a warehouse.
- Good.

365
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,920
Here's 300 bucks and an
ID to get you started.

366
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,320
- And then what?
- Another 300 next week.

367
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,300
You're on your own.

368
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,900
It's nice.

369
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,520
- There's nothing in the fridge!
- Guess you'd better go to the store.

370
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,340
Something wrong?

371
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,000
No, just looking at the view.

372
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,719
All right.

373
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,220
I'll let you get settled.

374
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:35,040
He hasn't stabbed anybody in
the eye yet. So, that's a start.

375
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,800
Eden, I want a seratonin
metabolite analysis.

376
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,220
Attaboy!

377
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,980
- Tracking okay?
- We're on.

378
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,900
Oh, man, he's oh for eight.

379
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,279
What we'll do if no
one will hire him?

380
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,780
The question is, what he'll do?

381
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,860
He's into current events now?

382
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,080
- He's checking out the classifieds.
- Impressive!

383
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:03,680
Yeah, Sully. Sully from inside.
He told me to call you.

384
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,280
250 is all I can spare,
you understand?

385
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,300
Why? 'Cause I gotta
buy groceries.

386
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,759
Sully, yes.

387
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,260
All right. Good.
I'll see you there.

388
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,820
- You guys hiring?
- You see a Help Wanted sign?

389
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,540
You in the blue shirt.
Come here.

390
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,540
- What?
- Think I can help you.

391
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,220
You can fill out this application.

392
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,540
- What d'ya wanna know?
- The usual.

393
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,440
I know everything about cars.
Foreign, American, everything.

394
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:31,160
All you need to know is how to drive
them 10 feet without crashing them.

395
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,900
I could do that.

396
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:44,880
I'm gonna have to get back to you
for the numbers for references.

397
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:49,240
Don't worry. Put any number. I'm
the one who makes the phone calls.

398
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,920
Give these away to people who get the
hot wax. You getting the hot wax?

399
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:56,040
- No, sir.
- He's filling out the application.

400
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,719
It's looking really good.

401
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,679
- Are you a hard worker?
- Very hard.

402
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,520
- Take drugs?
- No. Vitamins, but that's it.

403
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,079
You bullshitting me? I don't
want drug addicts working for me.

404
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,580
I don't take drugs.
Honest. No drugs.

405
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,799
I'll start you at 5,75 an hour,
plus tips.

406
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,300
Go grab a rag and talk to Alfonso.
Tell him Ralph sent you.

407
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,900
- I'll be back at one.
- Thank you.

408
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,760
Here. Better go before
he changes his mind.

409
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,460
- Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.
- Sure.

410
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,719
You Sully's friend?

411
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,220
Do I know you?

412
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,919
I'm Sully's friend.

413
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,420
You got what I want?

414
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,960
You sound like someone
I knew. I think he's dead.

415
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,360
- Some son-of-a-bitch he was.
- I guess he can be me then.

416
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,460
- What's he doing?
- Looking for us.

417
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,500
I'd say that Lee Ray just took
the hidden out of hidden camera.

418
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,660
Nightmares again?

419
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,440
Can't give you any more.
Doc said two pills a night, max.

420
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:38,359
Did you ever try these things?

421
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,860
Nah. Soon as I hit
the bed, I'm out.

422
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,399
My daddy used to say that...

423
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,879
an honest man's pillow
is his peace of mind.

424
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,800
Wanna play cards? It's gonna take 20
minutes for these things to kick in.

425
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:52,960
I'm not supposed to do anything
that could affect your environment.

426
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,000
Winning a hand of cards is
really gonna affect my life!

427
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,799
Come on, I've got this
kick-ass root beer here.

428
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,300
You won't let me have any alcohol,
so I sprang for the good stuff.

429
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,860
All right,
but then I'm out the door.

430
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,900
Cheers.

431
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,599
How long have you been
working with theses guys?

432
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,200
Three years this month.
I used to be a cop in Detroit...

433
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:29,180
but this is much better.

434
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,280
I'm not even supposed to
talk to you. I gotta go.

435
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,039
- Get some sleep.
- No, take it with you.

436
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,540
- It's fine.
- Thanks, man.

437
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:26,940
What are you wearing?

438
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,719
Really?

439
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,220
Is that all?

440
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:35,920
I think you are a
very naughty girl.

441
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,180
Shit!

442
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,980
Come on, Brock.

443
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,940
I see your goddamn walkie.

444
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:02,200
The Blue Line for Davenport
now boarding on Track 4.

445
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,760
Dr. Copeland?
It's Norton. We've lost him.

446
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,040
The train is bound to Davenport.
We got him on GPS.

447
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,000
This piece of shit has been playing
a big con on us all along.

448
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,039
That's not possible.

449
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,540
What the hell's he
doing in Davenport?

450
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:50,180
Shit. That's where
Gary Caputo lives.

451
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:52,599
The guy Lee Ray shot
in the stairwell?

452
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:55,440
And his brother that testified
against Lee Ray lives there too.

453
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,620
Bill's not here!

454
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,679
Gary?

455
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,180
Bill's not here.

456
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,900
I'm not looking for Bill.

457
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,940
I came here to see you.

458
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,980
I like this commercial.

459
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:10,140
Who are you?

460
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,900
My name is Joe.

461
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:17,560
- I don't know anyone named Joe.
- I'm a new friend.

462
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,980
I wanna tell you something.

463
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:34,080
Long time ago,
somebody hurt you.

464
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,740
Really bad.
They hurt you really bad.

465
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,640
And they want me to tell you they
were really sorry for what they did.

466
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,420
They're really sorry
for hurting you.

467
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,900
It's okay.

468
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,780
No, it's not.

469
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,940
No, it's not.

470
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,679
Here. I got you something.

471
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,180
I got you some stuff. Here.

472
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,980
I don't know what you like
so I got you what I like.

473
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,559
I'm not supposed to
eat too much candy.

474
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,060
- Look at this.
- But I do.

475
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,280
Listen to me,
anything that you want...

476
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:28,160
if you wanna go see a movie,
go to the park...

477
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:32,580
whatever you want,
you tell me.

478
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,820
I'll see you again soon.

479
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,940
Was that guy in here?

480
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:11,440
- He's my friend.
- What do you mean?

481
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,680
- He's gonna take me to a movie.
- What? What's his name?

482
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,920
- I forget.
- You fucking forget everything!

483
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:26,820
Where do I know that guy?

484
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,359
You gotta sign the check again.

485
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,860
Here!

486
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,000
- What do I write?
- Jesus Christ...

487
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,660
do we have to go over this
every goddamn month?

488
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:48,520
Write Pay to the Order of William
Caputo and then you sign it.

489
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:10,440
I should blow your fucking brains
out. You and Dimi Vertov.

490
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:13,440
He sent you, didn't he? You're lucky
I'm gonna give you another chance.

491
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,280
Leave me alone.
You tell him to leave me alone.

492
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,940
You understand? I'm a different
person now. It's over.

493
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,959
Turn the fuck over.

494
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:25,159
You count to 500.

495
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,660
If I see a fucking eyebrow
twitch, you're dead!

496
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,540
Don't move, asshole!

497
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,480
Move a muscle,
you'll be nothing but a bloodstain.

498
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:06,380
Ya think we weren't
gonna catch up with you?

499
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,440
- What the hell were you thinking?
- I needed to see Gary.

500
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,319
To apologize.
I was coming back.

501
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,820
- Brock is okay?
- Brock is unemployed.

502
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,300
It wasn't his fault.
I had to go see Gary.

503
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:22,280
I can't sleep.
I had to see Gary.

504
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,180
- I was coming back.
- Here's his train ticket, Doc.

505
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:27,900
Round trip.

506
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,360
- You were really coming back?
- What else am I gonna go?

507
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,439
You gotta give him his job back.
It wasn't his fault!

508
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,160
- I bet you want him back.
- If anyone figures out who you are...

509
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:42,360
if anyone knows you're alive, the deal
is off and it's back to the warden.

510
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,500
You understand that,
don't you?

511
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:48,820
Can I have a pill, please?

512
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:11,020
Couldn't be!

513
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:18,079
Was this the guy who that in here?

514
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,580
They showed that commercial again.

515
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:24,140
And you missed it.

516
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:31,599
The man had a return ticket,
for God's sakes!

517
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,919
What he did today was
an act of contrition.

518
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,719
12 weeks ago,
he had no remorse...

519
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,220
and now he's risking
his life to apologize!

520
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,120
- The man is a murderer.
- He was a murderer.

521
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:44,760
You put a guard in his room,
it'll influence his behaviour.

522
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,799
You can't do it!

523
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,300
If anything were happen,
we're responsible.

524
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:52,020
Hart-Mercer Pharmaceuticals!

525
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,039
I'll give you one more chance...

526
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,240
then we move on to a different test
subject. Period. End of discussion.

527
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,079
Arlo...

528
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,640
is there something I should know
about the other test subjects?

529
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,559
I've told you.
Any knowledge of their status...

530
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:14,060
could influence your interaction
with your own subject.

531
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,920
Yes, but I heard a rumour
from one of the post-docs.

532
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:19,780
Some of the test subjects
have died of liver failure.

533
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,420
If it's true, I should know.

534
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,100
Has your subject shown
signs of liver damage?

535
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,140
No, he hasn't.

536
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,240
The most significant side effects
are insomnia, dry mouth...

537
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,759
persistent feelings of
guilt and remorse.

538
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:37,239
Nothing here about
liver complications.

539
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,920
You don't need to concern
yourself with the other subjects.

540
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,820
You have enough on
you hands as it is.

541
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:46,720
You shouldn't spend so much
time listening to post-docs.

542
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,500
Especially the
attractive ones.

543
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:58,580
You don't like relish much,
do you?

544
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:01,180
Trying to eat more vegetables.

545
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:07,160
- So what's Cincinnati like?
- They got a baseball team.

546
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,820
I guess you don't miss it much.

547
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,960
I just wanted to start from scratch.

548
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:21,000
Me too.
It's a beautiful thing, isn't it?

549
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,340
- What's that?
- Starting from scratch.

550
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,079
I hear you.

551
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:30,440
Ralph says you're doing really good.
He says you caught on quick.

552
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:35,760
It's not too much to catch on to.
You want some dessert or...

553
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,959
They got a really good
ice cream sandwich.

554
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:40,720
- Come on, I owe you!
- You don't owe me anything.

555
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:43,380
I owe you.

556
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:51,060
Fairly smooth.

557
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:54,000
- What are you reading?
- Introduction to Geology.

558
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:57,060
- It's a real page-turner.
- You go to school?

559
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,080
Community College, nights.
It's my second semester.

560
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:04,560
- Keeps me busy.
- I knew you had brains.

561
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,100
If had brains,
would I be working here?

562
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,620
Come on!

563
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,660
You ever been inside?

564
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,039
Inside what?

565
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:19,540
Come on.

566
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,260
Do you do this very often?

567
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,439
I don't know.

568
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:41,120
For some reason
I find it to be relaxing.

569
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:46,600
- It is.
- For a couple of minutes...

570
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,460
I feel I can think.

571
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:51,639
I guess I can see that.

572
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:54,680
Only thing is, you have to
haul ass before Ralph sees you.

573
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:00,940
You get a thing?

574
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:14,740
Teresa...

575
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,940
what are you thinking?

576
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:25,060
Guess.

577
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,780
Jump!

578
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:42,300
- Did he see us?
- I almost tripped over my foot.

579
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,960
- Haven't seen him.
- He looks different now.

580
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:02,959
He doesn't have them scars.

581
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:05,800
He was in here 2 days ago.
It's on the receipt.

582
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:08,239
We get a lot of people
in here every day.

583
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,740
You should check the neighbourhood.
Maybe he lives around here.

584
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:14,620
Thanks.

585
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:57,199
Hop in. I'll give you
a ride to your place.

586
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,700
Looks like the doc's
breaking the cardinal rule:

587
00:59:00,560 --> 00:59:02,759
Never get attached
to you lab rat.

588
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:05,159
Thanks, Doc.

589
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,660
Let's go.

590
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,760
- Thanks for the lift.
- Sure. Put on your belt.

591
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:17,119
Check those books out?

592
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:21,400
I stole them. Had to pop a couple
librarians to make me getaway.

593
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,959
- Nice.
- This is a sweet ride.

594
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,639
I drove one of these
on the car wash.

595
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:28,140
I only drive like 10 feet but...

596
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:31,340
You got a family, Doc?

597
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:34,340
That's none of your business.

598
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:38,940
I was just curious. I was just
wondering if you had a family.

599
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:42,400
It's inappropriate for you to
ask me personal questions.

600
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:45,520
But it's okay for you to
know everything about me.

601
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:50,480
I see how it works. Just curious.
What? Come on. I wanna know.

602
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:55,580
My wife and I have split up.

603
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,660
- And we had a son.
- Is he living with her?

604
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:01,420
No, he was killed.

605
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:05,660
- Accident? Was he sick or...
- Murder.

606
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:09,420
He was 8 years old.

607
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,520
We were driving home from the
park after shooting hoops...

608
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:17,320
like we did on every Saturday when
I could get away from work...

609
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,159
and a car cut us off.

610
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:25,360
I laid on the horn, changed lanes.
He cut me off again and I lost it.

611
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:29,480
I flipped him the bird and start
screaming and the next thing I know...

612
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:32,180
the guy shoots at me with a gun.

613
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,480
The windshield shatters.
I pull over, turn...

614
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:39,820
Tommy's slumped over
covered in blood.

615
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,820
He looked at me and said:

616
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:48,440
"It's gonna be okay, daddy.
I'm gonna be okay."

617
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,880
- And then he died.
- I'm sorry, Doc.

618
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:58,320
If that guy had been on Anagress,
maybe my son'd be alive today.

619
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:01,060
If I had been on
Anagress maybe...

620
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:05,120
You can just drop me off here.
I'll walk the rest of the way.

621
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,439
Thanks for the lift.

622
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:11,940
There you go.

623
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:17,100
- I have a date tomorrow night.
- Really?

624
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:21,320
- Good for you. That's great.
- This thing around my ankle...

625
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:24,060
- It stays where it is.
- Come on! What if I get lucky?

626
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:26,319
You're gonna have to figure out
a way to keep your pants on.

627
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,820
- Come on, Doc!
- Sorry, pal. I can't help you.

628
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:32,400
I'm not gonna run, I swear!
I like the way things are right now.

629
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:35,100
- I'm not gonna run.
- I know, I believe you but...

630
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,420
I got rules to follow too.

631
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:43,380
Borrow the car?

632
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:46,839
Have a good time.

633
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:49,039
- Thanks for the ride.
- Sure.

634
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,540
Be well, Joe.

635
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:09,580
They didn't change a thing.

636
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,500
- Can you tell me what's going on?
- What do you mean?

637
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,700
I haven't had dinner with
you since... I can remember...

638
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:18,260
even when we
were still together...

639
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:22,560
Friday's? I thought it was
in the off-limits category.

640
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:27,000
We only came here because...
Tommy liked it so much.

641
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:33,040
What can I tell you? I'm jonesing
for a number 3 with hickory sauce.

642
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:40,879
I'm surprised they
let us back in here.

643
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:43,480
- I don't think they recognized us.
- How could they forget?

644
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:45,559
The flames almost
touched the ceiling.

645
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,039
How could they forget...

646
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:49,239
how you tried to douse the
flames with your milkshake?

647
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:53,200
Who was the genius who left
his menu on a smoking toaster?

648
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,860
It's a stupid place
to put a toaster!

649
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:58,380
And let's face it:
We both panicked.

650
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:01,440
Only Tommy stayed calm. Just
unplugged it and got the manager.

651
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:09,720
That's the first time I've heard
you say his name since...

652
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:21,840
I brought the papers
for the lake house.

653
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:27,880
We got a pretty good price.
It will be divided fifty-fifty...

654
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:31,160
as per our very amicable
divorce agreement.

655
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,420
Right here.

656
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:37,120
I've cashed in my stock options.

657
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:39,479
Really?

658
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:42,280
Hart-Mercer not seem like a good
investment all of a sudden?

659
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:46,600
No, but I'm buying an old
school building downtown.

660
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:50,880
It's a major fixer-upper but my
accountant says that real state...

661
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:53,279
is less risky than biotech
these days, so...

662
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:54,399
True.

663
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,320
I'm gonna open up that youth
center I was always talking about.

664
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:00,180
- At least, I'm gonna try anyway.
- You'll do it.

665
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:04,640
Barbara, that's great.
I thing that's really great.

666
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:11,780
You know that colleague
you introduce me to?

667
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:15,740
She's very pretty.

668
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:18,620
Reminds me a bit of me
when I was that age.

669
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,520
You were prettier.
And a bit smarter.

670
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:50,959
You look nice.

671
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,279
- Whatever.
- Whatever.

672
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:55,780
Come on.

673
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:20,280
- You know this guy?
- Can't say I do, mister.

674
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:23,620
- Ugly son-of-a-bitch, ain't he?
- Look closer.

675
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,700
He's different now. No scars.

676
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:29,420
He changed his face,
but's still him.

677
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:34,000
You do know him, don't you? He
just drove out of here with that girl.

678
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:36,880
Why are you looking for him?
Do he owe you money?

679
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:39,540
- Then what'd he do?
- For starters...

680
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:42,540
he shot my brother in the head.

681
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:11,839
This is really cool!

682
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:14,400
I can't believe you've never been
to an amusement park before.

683
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:17,360
When I was a kid,
a sandbox was a big deal.

684
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:20,919
Want a beer?

685
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:23,420
- No.
- Sure?

686
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:26,039
I'm 10 months sober.

687
01:06:26,040 --> 01:06:28,540
Really?
Can't picture you a big drinker.

688
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:31,740
Drinking wasn't really my thing.

689
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:35,600
I dated this guy,
and he was a dealer.

690
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:40,200
I ended up doing speed with him
'til it got out of control.

691
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:43,640
I was down to 95 pounds
by the time I hit rehab.

692
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:49,980
Too much information
at once, huh?

693
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:52,940
At least you got out.

694
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:56,960
- You got yourself a second chance.
- I had to.

695
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,679
I see it like this...

696
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:02,240
keep one eye in the past
and one eye in the future...

697
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,980
you end up cross-eyed.

698
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:09,560
So I'm thinking about right now.
And right now...

699
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:14,240
- I'm happy. I'm having fun.
- Me too.

700
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,940
I got an idea. Come on.

701
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:33,839
I still think we should go in.

702
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:37,440
Give him some space. He's gotta
come out the same way he went in.

703
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:49,500
Lee Ray!

704
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:11,880
- You're very aggressive out there.
- It's better than crashing real cars.

705
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,319
That's true.

706
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:17,640
You wanna try the merry-go-round?
I'm a merry-go-round freak.

707
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:19,279
Really?

708
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:21,780
- Sure.
- Doesn't make you dizzy.

709
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,839
I gotta go to the bathroom.
I'll be right back.

710
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:31,680
- You don't mind I go on...
- No. I'll be right back.

711
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:22,060
Get out of the way!

712
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:41,220
You there! Stop!

713
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:55,279
Did I miss anything?

714
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:57,880
Nothing much. It was a tight
race but I won by a nose.

715
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,980
- What took you so long?
- Long line. Ready?

716
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:11,420
So...

717
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:14,140
you want me to drop you off?

718
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:18,040
I'll walk home from you apartment.
Make sure you get home safe.

719
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,340
- What?
- Wanna make sure I get home safe?

720
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,300
I was gonna invite
you in, anyway.

721
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,919
You got a nice apartment.

722
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,420
Welcome to my palace, darling.

723
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:57,400
The maid's quarters are downstairs.
And it's the butler's day off.

724
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:02,260
Hope you don't mind.

725
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:05,519
You probably wanted to
stay at the park longer.

726
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,799
I'm sorry. I hope I didn't
mess things up.

727
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:11,280
Don't worry about it.
Can't be a kid forever.

728
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:27,580
Joe...

729
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:32,000
I've trusted a lot
of people in my life.

730
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:44,360
I was wondering if...
I can trust you.

731
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:57,079
There's something
I should tell you though.

732
01:11:57,080 --> 01:12:00,280
- Great. I've heard that before.
- No, it's not that.

733
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:08,200
I'm on this medicine...
these pills...

734
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:12,680
that make you...
calm or something.

735
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,500
What happens when you
don't take them?

736
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:21,020
You wouldn't wanna know me.

737
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:30,360
Whatever it is they're doing,
it's working.

738
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:57,920
- I should probably go.
- What's wrong?

739
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:03,280
Nothing. I just wanna have
something to look forward to.

740
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,519
Right.

741
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:10,560
A guy who didn't want to jump
my bones on the first date.

742
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:13,780
I can trust you.

743
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:16,420
- I had a great time tonight.
- Me too.

744
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:22,760
- Something to look forward to.
- I'm gonna regret having said that.

745
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:28,140
I'll see you tomorrow?

746
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:41,200
- I thought he was gonna get lucky.
- Tough break.

747
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:44,520
Just in time.
He's overdue for his Anagress.

748
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:04,599
Shit!
There's nowhere to park.

749
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:07,100
Drive around the block
We'll find another one.

750
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,780
Got ya, motherfucker!

751
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,380
Drop the gun!

752
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,500
Dammit!

753
01:15:00,480 --> 01:15:02,980
Shit!

754
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:26,100
What's up with this asshole?

755
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:37,879
My God!

756
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:39,839
My God!

757
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:42,340
Shit!

758
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:51,260
Tell me you're not
gonna get that.

759
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:00,340
Hello?

760
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:03,239
OK. I'll be right there.

761
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:05,719
- Let's go.
- No, you can't.

762
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:08,220
- Why?
- It might be dangerous.

763
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:11,439
If you're not gonna
let me go with you...

764
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:13,940
I'm not gonna stay here by myself.

765
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:20,240
- He ditched it in the trash bin.
- I just can't believe that he...

766
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,799
Don't you see how he played you?
He's a sociopath.

767
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,079
You should've known better.
Those bastards can fool...

768
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:28,040
polygraph machines. What made
you think he couldn't fool you?

769
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:31,420
I don't know.

770
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:34,240
He's in a black pickup with flame
decals. Make sure he doesn't go far.

771
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,900
- You're authorized to terminate.
- What's that supposed to mean?

772
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:39,440
You know the protocol. If the
subject commits a violent crime...

773
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:42,039
during Phase 2,
there's no alternative.

774
01:16:42,040 --> 01:16:43,719
He's already dead in
the eyes of the law.

775
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:46,039
And that justifies us hunting
him down and killing him?

776
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:48,359
Goddamn right, it does.

777
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:51,560
We'll do an autopsy and figure out
what happened with the Anagress.

778
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:54,220
Go to the lab.
Make the necessary adjustments.

779
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:56,740
You'll be back on
track in no time.

780
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:14,100
Come on! Get up!

781
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:20,740
Right here.

782
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:25,560
You can get rid of all those scars.
You still got the same evil eyes.

783
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,500
So, what'd you do?

784
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:36,020
Pay off the doctor?
The warden?

785
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:40,680
Where'd a low-life like you get
the money to fake an execution?

786
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:46,800
- I'm sorry about Gary...
- That just wraps everything up.

787
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:51,020
Right, Gary?

788
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:55,120
- Fuckhead here says he's sorry.
- He's my friend.

789
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:57,799
- He's your friend, huh?
- We're going to the movies.

790
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:00,400
You're going to the
movies together?

791
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:03,460
Is that right?
You're good friends?

792
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:06,580
Tell my brother what
a good friend you are!

793
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:10,420
- I'm sorry...
- Shut up!

794
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:12,940
Shut the fuck up with sorry!

795
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:18,400
I saw you snickering
with that lawyer.

796
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:21,060
You didn't have an ounce of remorse.

797
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:25,820
Tell my brother what
you did to him.

798
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:28,839
Gary...

799
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:31,840
your friend wants to tell you
exactly what he did to you.

800
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:35,100
He gave me candy.

801
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:38,820
Tell him.

802
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:51,480
I didn't tell you the truth about
someone else hurting you.

803
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:56,540
I did it.

804
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:02,140
Tell him what you did!

805
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:11,580
I shot you in the head.

806
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:17,220
I shot you.

807
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:20,660
- I'm really sorry, Gary.
- Shut up!

808
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:25,000
Fucking sorry. I could've had
a life if it wasn't for you.

809
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:28,620
Instead I had to take care of
my fucking brother all the time!

810
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:31,440
- If I could trade places with him...
- Shut up!

811
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:35,140
Look at me.

812
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:38,140
- Fuck you!
- He's my friend!

813
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:40,839
Don't!

814
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:43,340
Go! Go!

815
01:19:43,560 --> 01:19:45,759
Get off!

816
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:48,260
Get the fuck off me, Gary!

817
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:05,100
Get those monitors packed up.

818
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:15,780
- Copeland.
- Doctor, I need my medicine.

819
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:17,439
- Where are you?
- Did Norton make it?

820
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:19,919
You shot him in the heart. Of course
he didn't make it. He's dead!

821
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:21,959
- I didn't shoot him!
- Don't lie to me!

822
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:24,279
I'm not lying!
Bill Caputo shot him.

823
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:26,319
He recognized me when
I went to see Gary!

824
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:28,399
He just kidnapped me
and tried to kill me!

825
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:30,900
- Why the hell should I believe you?
- Do you think I'd kill Norton?

826
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:33,199
After all this,
do you thing I'd do that?

827
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:36,600
They must've seen his car.
Caputo took me in his truck.

828
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:39,400
Your guys must have seen it.
Have them check it out.

829
01:20:39,560 --> 01:20:41,279
You gotta believe.
Just come and get me.

830
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:44,000
- Come and give me my medicine.
- Where are you?

831
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:58,420
Where's the fire?

832
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:01,700
Maybe we better find out.

833
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:24,420
Shit!

834
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:00,479
- I need help.
- You want the Emergency Room.

835
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:02,980
- I need Anagress.
- Never heard of it.

836
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:05,599
Do you have a prescription?

837
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:10,160
Give me something to mellow
me out! What do you got?

838
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:12,900
Don't hurt me, man!

839
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:32,460
Come here.
Where are you going?

840
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:12,799
Teresa?

841
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:15,300
I need your help.

842
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:19,120
Are you there? I need your help.
I'm in trouble. Please, let me in.

843
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:25,380
Teresa, please, come to the door.

844
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,500
God! Teresa?

845
01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:34,180
- Let me in. I'm in trouble...
- Ralph called.

846
01:23:34,240 --> 01:23:37,160
He said somebody came to see him.
They said you were a killer.

847
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:40,180
That your name is Lee Ray.
Is that true?

848
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:43,380
- Is it true?
- I was...

849
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:47,040
Please, don't do this to me.
I was Lee Ray.

850
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:49,740
I'm a different person now.
I'm not who I was.

851
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:53,260
I can't be who I was.

852
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:58,180
Please, they're coming after me.
Don't do this to me.

853
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:00,840
- It's the cops, isn't it?
- No, they're not the cops.

854
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:04,400
Jesus! If you don't let me in,
they're gonna kill me.

855
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:08,620
Teresa, please!

856
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:20,220
Open up!

857
01:24:21,240 --> 01:24:23,519
- We're here for Joe Monroe.
- Who?

858
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:26,020
Go!

859
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:52,159
I got here as fast as I could.
What happened?

860
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:56,240
- It's all gone to shit.
- What do you mean?

861
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:00,319
I keep on asking myself...

862
01:25:00,320 --> 01:25:03,920
am I arrogant or
I was just stupid?

863
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:10,940
I had such hopes for Anagress...

864
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:15,799
I need my pills. Now!

865
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:18,279
- What's going on?
- Everything is gonna be fine.

866
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:20,759
It's not gonna be fine until
I get my pill. You got them?

867
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:22,759
- Get them!
- Not until she leaves.

868
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:25,260
- She's not going anywhere.
- I know you didn't kill Norton.

869
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:28,780
That was Bill Caputo's truck,
just like you said.

870
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:32,519
And I know what kind
of person you are.

871
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:35,020
And you gonna let her go 'cause
she has nothing to do with this.

872
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:40,980
Barbara, go.

873
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:47,200
Do not call the police
or I'll be in trouble.

874
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:49,860
Just go. It's gonna be fine, Joe.

875
01:25:50,160 --> 01:25:52,119
I want everything
back the way it was.

876
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:54,800
- Please, give me my pills.
- The pills are in my office.

877
01:25:57,040 --> 01:26:00,080
This isn't enough. What am I
supposed to do when this runs out?

878
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:08,799
- Eden Ross.
- Hi, it's me.

879
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:12,200
- I need you to do something for me.
- Now you need my help?

880
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:14,940
Please, this is important.

881
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:18,520
Take all the Anagress we
have and bring it to my house.

882
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:21,180
- Can you do that?
- Okay.

883
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:23,860
And don't tell anyone.

884
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:30,799
Was that him?

885
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:33,300
What'd he want?

886
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:36,160
He wants me to bring the lab
supply of Anagress to his house.

887
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:39,860
Well done.

888
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:42,420
It's my job.

889
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:46,480
- She'll be here in half an hour.
- Thanks.

890
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:25,100
What's happening?

891
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:27,079
Did you hear anything?

892
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:29,580
- Where is he?
- What?

893
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:32,800
Eden said you asked her to
bring Anagress to your house.

894
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:39,120
I tried to warn you. Post-docs,
they always put their careers first.

895
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:42,940
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

896
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:45,479
He called one hour ago...

897
01:27:45,480 --> 01:27:47,980
but wouldn't say where he was.
Just wanted his pills.

898
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:56,520
He didn't kill Norton.
Bill Caputo did.

899
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:59,360
It was Bill Caputo's truck
they saw driving away.

900
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:02,620
Joe Monroe doesn't have to die.

901
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:06,079
The Anagress works.

902
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:07,999
All we have to do is get him
back on the medication.

903
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:11,680
- Anagress doesn't work.
- Anagress does work.

904
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:14,119
Doesn't work!

905
01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:16,559
All the subjects who
took Anagress are dead.

906
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:19,060
Their livers shut
down after six weeks.

907
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:23,400
- He's fine.
- He was on a placebo.

908
01:28:25,720 --> 01:28:28,220
He was part of the control group.

909
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:31,860
He was getting
nothing but sugar pills.

910
01:28:32,160 --> 01:28:34,800
If he was taking the actual
medicine, he'd be dead right now.

911
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:37,239
But...

912
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:38,839
that's not possible.

913
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:41,279
You knew there was a chance
he'd be in the control group.

914
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:45,560
Yes, but his biomarkers,
his seratonin levels... scientifically...

915
01:28:45,760 --> 01:28:48,360
Never underestimate the
power of the placebo effect.

916
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:51,800
People have cured themselves from
every disease known to science.

917
01:28:52,240 --> 01:28:55,000
Eradicated tumours, for Chrissakes!

918
01:28:55,560 --> 01:29:00,560
But eventually the
placebo effect dies.

919
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,500
I need a drink.

920
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:12,820
Anybody want a drink?

921
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:25,020
- Hello?
- Michael, is he still in the house?

922
01:29:26,520 --> 01:29:28,719
No, he's outside.

923
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:31,640
He crapped all over the floor.
I think he's got worms.

924
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:34,420
- I'm keeping him outside.
- Does he still have a gun?

925
01:29:34,440 --> 01:29:37,800
No, but the vet
should check him out.

926
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:40,880
- He'll be ready when you get here.
- I'm calling the police.

927
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:43,079
I got to go now.

928
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:46,240
- I'm expecting a work call.
- OK. Bye.

929
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:51,399
That was Barbara.

930
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:53,920
I call her whenever the dog is sick.
You know how she is.

931
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:57,040
Are you still seeing her?
I always liked Barbara.

932
01:29:57,240 --> 01:30:00,040
No, we just share
custody of the dog.

933
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:03,240
You sure you don't want a drink?
'Cause I need one.

934
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:07,020
Maybe I'll have a drink.

935
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:30,660
Shit!

936
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:46,159
You can get yourself
killed for doing this.

937
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:48,660
Nobody is gonna get killed.

938
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:58,880
Gonna get you to the airport.
Put you on the next flight out.

939
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:02,400
- I don't have enough pills.
- You don't need any pills.

940
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:05,039
- What are you talking about?
- You don't need them.

941
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:07,239
They were nothing but sugar.

942
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:09,740
- What?
- They didn't do a damn thing.

943
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:19,580
Son-of-a-bitch!

944
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:25,160
When we start a drug trial, half the
subjects are picked at random...

945
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:29,520
to get the actual drug, the other half
are given a phoney pill: The placebo.

946
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:33,380
You were in
the control group.

947
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:38,199
That's bullshit!

948
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:41,720
No. I never lied to you and
I'm not lying to you now.

949
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:52,580
- He's headed for the lake.
- We got him.

950
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,500
You know what to do.

951
01:31:57,360 --> 01:31:59,479
You knew this the whole time?

952
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:01,879
It would've affected
how I treated you.

953
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:03,639
I just found out tonight, I swear.

954
01:32:03,640 --> 01:32:05,839
You knew theses
things weren't real?

955
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:08,340
They were real to you,
and that's what matters.

956
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:17,380
You okay?

957
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:21,260
You gotta get outta here.

958
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:24,840
Get to the airport anyway you can.
Here's some money.

959
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:27,940
Disappear. Go.

960
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:31,479
- That was you, Doc.
- What?

961
01:34:31,480 --> 01:34:33,980
You're the reason why I got better.
It wasn't any drug.

962
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:36,900
You changed yourself.

963
01:34:37,240 --> 01:34:39,479
Now hurry! Go!

964
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:41,980
Go!

965
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:16,820
You gotta go.

966
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:47,679
- What do you think of it so far?
- It's okay.

967
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:50,180
Let's have a look outside.

968
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:56,759
Beautiful!

969
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:59,360
- Wayne, this is Michael.
- How you doing, Wayne?

970
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:02,760
- Good.
- You wanna meet the other guys?

971
01:37:06,680 --> 01:37:08,439
Come on.

972
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:11,480
All right, Rhonda,
time to play a real master.

973
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:19,940
I want you to meet Wayne!
