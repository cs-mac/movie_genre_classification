1
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,108
Good evening, child.

2
00:01:10,711 --> 00:01:11,678
Evening, Mama.

3
00:01:11,912 --> 00:01:13,780
Home already? I'm so happy.

4
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:14,982
Mama...

5
00:01:15,048 --> 00:01:16,550
Not so fast.

6
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,585
Please. Leave me be.
I'm tired.

7
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:20,454
I can quite believe it.

8
00:01:20,621 --> 00:01:22,956
Your last pupil left 3 hours ago.

9
00:01:23,123 --> 00:01:25,859
Might I know
where you've been all this time?

10
00:01:25,993 --> 00:01:26,593
Please.

11
00:01:26,727 --> 00:01:29,763
No, you don't.
Not until you tell me!

12
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,298
No.

13
00:01:33,967 --> 00:01:35,969
I went for a walk. Do you mind?

14
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:40,207
I spent 8 hours in my cage.
I was tired and needed some air.

15
00:01:40,307 --> 00:01:42,342
- For three hours?
- Absolutely!

16
00:02:01,895 --> 00:02:03,597
Magnificent.

17
00:02:03,897 --> 00:02:05,399
Just as I thought.

18
00:02:14,808 --> 00:02:16,310
Where's the bankbook?

19
00:02:21,715 --> 00:02:23,584
10,000 Schillings!

20
00:02:24,618 --> 00:02:27,087
Tell me, have you lost your mind?

21
00:02:29,389 --> 00:02:30,791
Where's my grey Autumn suit?

22
00:02:32,059 --> 00:02:33,660
No idea.

23
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:36,029
Give that back.

24
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:36,597
No.

25
00:02:37,731 --> 00:02:38,198
No.

26
00:02:43,937 --> 00:02:44,905
Bitch!

27
00:02:46,073 --> 00:02:47,841
I remember that talk show.

28
00:02:47,975 --> 00:02:50,177
The guy advocated fines
for dog owners

29
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,346
whose dogs crap in the street.

30
00:02:52,813 --> 00:02:53,580
Bullshit.

31
00:02:53,847 --> 00:02:58,118
The creep was defending the idea
that women are inferior to men.

32
00:02:58,685 --> 00:02:59,186
Rubbish.

33
00:02:59,353 --> 00:03:01,822
If you'd let me get a word in...

34
00:03:01,922 --> 00:03:03,190
Who rattled your cage!

35
00:03:16,203 --> 00:03:17,871
Should cut your hands off.

36
00:03:19,273 --> 00:03:21,642
Beating your own mother!

37
00:03:26,246 --> 00:03:28,582
That frock was far too gaudy anyway.

38
00:03:28,882 --> 00:03:31,351
At your age,
you should know what suits you.

39
00:03:31,518 --> 00:03:33,487
Can't you stop, you cow?

40
00:03:33,687 --> 00:03:35,989
Wasn't ruining that enough for you?

41
00:03:36,156 --> 00:03:37,624
- I wish...
- What?

42
00:03:39,493 --> 00:03:40,727
You daren't say it?

43
00:03:40,894 --> 00:03:43,230
Don't bother.
I know what you wish.

44
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:46,433
I could have had a heart attack
from the agitation.

45
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:48,869
If that's what you want,
go ahead.

46
00:03:49,403 --> 00:03:52,072
Stop it, Mama,
you don't know what you're saying.

47
00:03:52,906 --> 00:03:54,541
There's a real hole here.

48
00:03:55,742 --> 00:03:57,477
Here, too.

49
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:00,681
Sorry.

50
00:04:01,081 --> 00:04:02,883
But why do you do these things?

51
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:05,919
Why do you do these things?

52
00:04:08,088 --> 00:04:11,124
I'm sorry.
Truly sorry.

53
00:04:11,491 --> 00:04:13,026
Let me look.

54
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,905
Never mind that.

55
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:30,611
That's how it is.
We're a hot-blooded family.

56
00:04:31,945 --> 00:04:34,147
Come on, stop crying.

57
00:04:35,682 --> 00:04:37,184
I'll make some coffee.

58
00:04:38,652 --> 00:04:41,488
We'll have a cup together. Okay?

59
00:04:42,356 --> 00:04:44,024
Nothing in life comes free.

60
00:04:45,158 --> 00:04:48,128
You'll just have to give
more private lessons.

61
00:04:49,363 --> 00:04:53,333
Your vanity must not
stop us buying our apartment.

62
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:56,169
You can't contradict me there.

63
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:00,340
I paid this month's instalment
long ago, don't worry.

64
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:06,179
In any case,
the dress only cost 6,500.

65
00:05:06,413 --> 00:05:08,982
I'll pay the remainder
back in tomorrow.

66
00:05:09,249 --> 00:05:10,684
I don't understand

67
00:05:10,851 --> 00:05:13,854
why someone of your standing
slaps make-up on

68
00:05:14,121 --> 00:05:16,390
and fritters money away

69
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:19,293
on frocks that will soon be
out of fashion.

70
00:05:20,627 --> 00:05:24,431
I'd be wearing that dress for years.
The cut was so classical.

71
00:05:24,765 --> 00:05:26,099
It was ageless.

72
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,538
If memory serves me right,

73
00:05:31,672 --> 00:05:34,575
you used to have a dress
just like it. Remember?

74
00:05:34,675 --> 00:05:36,243
You must be dreaming.

75
00:05:36,476 --> 00:05:39,813
It was a designer label.
The finishing was remarkable.

76
00:05:40,981 --> 00:05:43,317
It would have lasted forever.

77
00:05:47,387 --> 00:05:49,690
Do you still need the light?

78
00:06:08,408 --> 00:06:10,544
Did they really annoy you today?

79
00:06:12,346 --> 00:06:14,348
No more than usual.

80
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,853
Did you have the Schober girl?
Isn't Friday her day?

81
00:06:23,757 --> 00:06:24,925
Well?

82
00:06:27,394 --> 00:06:29,062
She's not untalented.

83
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:33,100
She has a surprising affinity
for Schubert.

84
00:06:37,337 --> 00:06:40,007
Schubert's your department,
don't forget.

85
00:06:41,008 --> 00:06:43,243
That's not for you to say.

86
00:06:44,177 --> 00:06:47,848
You're hardly a judge
of what is my department musically.

87
00:06:48,315 --> 00:06:51,585
If you want your pupils
to have a career instead of you...

88
00:06:52,052 --> 00:06:53,687
Mama...

89
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,929
No one must surpass you, my girl.

90
00:07:03,597 --> 00:07:05,032
No Mama.

91
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:08,235
Don't be dizzy...

92
00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:10,003
Erika.

93
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,374
Don't worry, Mama.

94
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:31,358
THE PIANO TEACHER

95
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,236
A little less pedal
wouldn't go amiss.

96
00:07:44,037 --> 00:07:46,807
It's not enough
just to take your foot off.

97
00:07:48,242 --> 00:07:50,410
A note may not be
as long as it is written

98
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:53,280
and may not be marked
as long as it should be held.

99
00:07:54,114 --> 00:07:56,316
from the novel by ELFRIEDE JELINEK

100
00:07:57,284 --> 00:08:00,354
And two, and three and four...

101
00:08:04,725 --> 00:08:08,762
And one, and two, and three
and four...

102
00:08:08,929 --> 00:08:10,430
And one, and two...

103
00:08:14,768 --> 00:08:17,037
Dogs are barking,

104
00:08:18,272 --> 00:08:20,908
Rattling their chains.

105
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:24,344
People are sleeping

106
00:08:24,778 --> 00:08:26,680
In their beds.

107
00:08:28,081 --> 00:08:30,918
Do you have no ear
for what coldness is?

108
00:08:31,151 --> 00:08:32,886
Or maybe you're just sloppy?

109
00:08:35,956 --> 00:08:37,524
And let go.

110
00:08:39,793 --> 00:08:41,628
And let go.

111
00:08:42,796 --> 00:08:45,232
The music is not purely descriptive.

112
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,437
And it's not drenched
in indifference and sentimentality.

113
00:08:51,471 --> 00:08:52,606
And let go.

114
00:08:52,873 --> 00:08:53,774
You see?

115
00:08:55,876 --> 00:08:59,279
Dogs are barking,

116
00:09:00,113 --> 00:09:03,684
Rattling their chains.

117
00:09:04,451 --> 00:09:07,788
People are sleeping

118
00:09:08,689 --> 00:09:11,558
In their beds.

119
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:51,665
A wrong note in Beethoven
is better than bad interpretation.

120
00:09:54,001 --> 00:09:55,102
You play only phrases.

121
00:09:55,302 --> 00:09:59,072
Ignore the structure
and you'll ruin the sonata.

122
00:10:02,743 --> 00:10:04,711
Back to the top of the page.

123
00:12:02,863 --> 00:12:05,065
I guessed you were for the recital.

124
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:06,567
Allow me to introduce...

125
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,869
Professor, please, do come in.

126
00:12:09,403 --> 00:12:10,537
Hello, Auntie.

127
00:12:10,671 --> 00:12:12,906
And your mother. Good evening.

128
00:12:12,906 --> 00:12:14,841
You've met my nephew?

129
00:12:14,908 --> 00:12:18,345
I was about to introduce myself.
My name's Walter Klemmer.

130
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,712
At the risk of seeming prosaic,

131
00:14:31,945 --> 00:14:36,083
after sampling spiritual
nourishment of such quality,

132
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:39,119
I've organised,
for the interval, a buffet

133
00:14:39,386 --> 00:14:41,722
to sustain the artists

134
00:14:41,955 --> 00:14:43,924
and, I hope,
for your pleasure, too.

135
00:14:44,324 --> 00:14:44,992
Through here.

136
00:14:59,973 --> 00:15:01,208
My husband's very particular...

137
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,376
Excuse me, Auntie.

138
00:15:02,543 --> 00:15:05,045
Sorry to interrupt but I can't wait.

139
00:15:05,712 --> 00:15:08,549
I hope it's not too forward of me
to kiss the hand

140
00:15:08,615 --> 00:15:09,917
that plays such Bach.

141
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,852
You can stop now.

142
00:15:12,085 --> 00:15:14,821
Where do you get
such unfashionable enthusiasm?

143
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:18,425
I'm delighted
the tradition of recitals lives on.

144
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:20,460
It was practically extinct.

145
00:15:20,594 --> 00:15:22,796
The masters die, then their music.

146
00:15:22,996 --> 00:15:25,732
People today
only ever listen to pop or rock.

147
00:15:25,832 --> 00:15:28,535
You're right.
Families like this are no more.

148
00:15:28,535 --> 00:15:30,571
Generations of laryngologists

149
00:15:31,104 --> 00:15:33,340
toiled over Beethoven's
last quartets.

150
00:15:33,774 --> 00:15:36,877
Now, at best, academics
stamp their feet in time

151
00:15:36,944 --> 00:15:40,013
to the trumpety-trumps
of Bruckner.

152
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,382
Disdaining Bruckner is immature,

153
00:15:42,516 --> 00:15:44,484
Mr... Klemmer?

154
00:15:46,186 --> 00:15:51,091
Tell me, what enables you
to talk about music so precociously?

155
00:15:51,258 --> 00:15:53,393
Your Aunt said you studied...

156
00:15:53,393 --> 00:15:56,196
Low voltage, professor.
Low voltage.

157
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:00,300
It was made between 1620 and 1630
by Marcel Pichler.

158
00:16:00,467 --> 00:16:02,436
From Hallein. A rare piece.

159
00:16:03,637 --> 00:16:05,105
Here.

160
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:10,310
It is played

161
00:16:11,378 --> 00:16:13,146
like a cello.

162
00:16:13,447 --> 00:16:16,483
Its common name is
leg viol or quinton.

163
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:21,855
Recently, I found a painting
that exactly shows this instrument.

164
00:16:22,256 --> 00:16:25,993
Not this type of instrument. I mean,
specifically this instrument.

165
00:16:28,228 --> 00:16:30,964
The painting depicts
a concert of viole da gamba

166
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:35,135
at the court of Duke Augustus
von Braunschweig-Wolfenbuttel.

167
00:16:35,936 --> 00:16:38,772
- Can I fetch you something?
- Not at all. Why?

168
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,342
It's fascinating.

169
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,444
Look at them.

170
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:47,714
Do they give a fig
about the benefits of illness?

171
00:16:50,851 --> 00:16:52,619
Have you read Adorno

172
00:16:52,753 --> 00:16:55,155
on Schumann's Fantasia in C Major?

173
00:16:55,355 --> 00:16:56,323
No.

174
00:16:56,857 --> 00:16:58,892
He talks of his twilight.

175
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,863
It's not Schumann bereft of reason,
but just before.

176
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,199
A fraction before.

177
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,768
He knows he's losing his mind.

178
00:17:08,202 --> 00:17:11,271
It torments him
but he clings on, one last time.

179
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,677
It's being aware
of what it means to lose oneself

180
00:17:17,211 --> 00:17:19,313
before being completely abandoned.

181
00:17:21,148 --> 00:17:23,317
I'd say you are a good teacher.

182
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:25,719
Thank you.

183
00:17:26,153 --> 00:17:29,690
You talk about things
as if they were yours. It's rare.

184
00:17:30,457 --> 00:17:32,192
And I think you know it.

185
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:35,562
Schubert and Schumann
are my favourites, that's all.

186
00:17:35,963 --> 00:17:39,299
Since my father died
completely mad in Steinhof asylum,

187
00:17:40,734 --> 00:17:44,404
I can talk easily about the twilight
of the mind, can't l?

188
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:50,110
If you'd really prefer not to eat,

189
00:17:50,477 --> 00:17:53,213
perhaps you'd care
for a drink of something?

190
00:17:53,914 --> 00:17:55,215
Go ahead.

191
00:18:04,892 --> 00:18:06,693
I had to sing for my supper.

192
00:18:06,693 --> 00:18:10,097
Dr. Blonsky with his instrument
fetish is such a bore.

193
00:18:11,064 --> 00:18:12,399
Honestly,

194
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:16,236
Klemmer, or whatever he's called,
seems a bit of a leech?

195
00:18:16,403 --> 00:18:19,339
Walter studies
at the Engineering School.

196
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,342
But his musicality
keeps up with technology,

197
00:18:22,543 --> 00:18:25,612
as you will understand
when you listen to him play.

198
00:18:25,846 --> 00:18:27,281
Over to you, Walter."

199
00:18:33,921 --> 00:18:36,590
My uncle exaggerates shamelessly.

200
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:40,794
After the professor's performance,
I feel doubly amateur.

201
00:18:40,928 --> 00:18:45,232
I had intended to play for you
Schenberg's Opus 33b,

202
00:18:45,365 --> 00:18:49,903
so that my wrong notes
might go unnoticed.

203
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,338
Not very funny, I know.

204
00:18:51,805 --> 00:18:55,209
But a discussion of
Schubert and Schumann's madness

205
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:58,145
left me deeply impressed.

206
00:18:58,312 --> 00:19:00,847
I have decided to drop Schenberg

207
00:19:01,148 --> 00:19:03,483
for my favourite piece by Schubert:

208
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,752
the Scherzo
from the Sonata in A Major.

209
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:19,493
...Dreaming of what they don't
have, replenished of good and bad.

210
00:20:19,826 --> 00:20:21,662
And next morning, all flown away.

211
00:20:22,029 --> 00:20:24,364
And here,
the mood switches to irony.

212
00:20:25,132 --> 00:20:26,900
D... D... D...

213
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,970
So what? So what?

214
00:20:30,404 --> 00:20:33,006
They've had their pleasure.

215
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,441
D... D... D...

216
00:20:34,641 --> 00:20:36,910
That's the obstinacy
of the complacent middle-class.

217
00:20:37,311 --> 00:20:40,280
And they hope
that what they left behind

218
00:20:41,748 --> 00:20:45,919
Might be waiting for them
on the pillows.

219
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,088
Excuse me, Professor.

220
00:20:48,355 --> 00:20:49,489
Can I have a word?

221
00:20:49,723 --> 00:20:50,691
Go ahead.

222
00:20:50,924 --> 00:20:55,229
Anna says you may not let her play
in the jubilee concert.

223
00:20:55,762 --> 00:20:57,764
I said a soloist
needs more than talent.

224
00:20:58,332 --> 00:20:59,499
She doesn't practice enough?

225
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,401
Only she can tell.

226
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,704
She works 8 hours a day.

227
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:06,073
It's the end result that counts,
not the hours.

228
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:09,243
For her, only music counts.
Look at her.

229
00:21:15,582 --> 00:21:17,751
Schubert isn't a walk in the park.

230
00:21:17,918 --> 00:21:19,853
I didn't say you wouldn't play.

231
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:22,456
We'll see how you gel
with the singer.

232
00:21:23,357 --> 00:21:25,826
Excuse me, I have a rehearsal.
Goodbye.

233
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:27,527
Goodbye.

234
00:21:27,728 --> 00:21:29,296
The Professor is right.

235
00:21:29,563 --> 00:21:32,399
Without total commitment,
you won't get anywhere.

236
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:35,068
Wipe your nose.
What do you look like?

237
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,207
Your mother wants you to call her.

238
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,344
I've only just arrived.

239
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,082
I don't know.
At least 3 hours.

240
00:21:51,585 --> 00:21:53,620
No! please Mama...

241
00:21:56,823 --> 00:21:58,692
In that case, I'll take a taxi.

242
00:21:59,726 --> 00:22:00,794
Yes!

243
00:22:03,096 --> 00:22:04,798
I'm not a baby.

244
00:22:05,065 --> 00:22:06,533
I have to go now.

245
00:22:38,198 --> 00:22:41,535
Can we play the trill the same?
I'll start on the upper note.

246
00:27:03,297 --> 00:27:04,064
Yes!

247
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:10,270
Sorry to disturb you.

248
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:12,639
What is it?

249
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,308
Professor Kohut?

250
00:27:14,908 --> 00:27:16,710
What do you want?

251
00:27:17,744 --> 00:27:20,047
At the Conservatory,
no one interrupts lessons.

252
00:27:21,048 --> 00:27:23,450
I apologise. I am very sorry

253
00:27:23,617 --> 00:27:27,154
but I wanted to come to you
rather than ask just anybody.

254
00:27:27,621 --> 00:27:28,555
About what?

255
00:27:28,956 --> 00:27:31,792
The entrance exam.
I want to join your master class.

256
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:35,028
That's very flattering, young man.

257
00:27:35,596 --> 00:27:37,531
I hope your interruption

258
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:41,068
is not to arouse interest
your talents don't merit.

259
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:45,172
Application forms are available
in the secretary's office.

260
00:27:45,439 --> 00:27:47,708
First floor, door 11 .

261
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:50,978
Please excuse us,
we have work to do.

262
00:27:51,178 --> 00:27:52,412
Continue.

263
00:27:54,181 --> 00:27:55,215
Go on.

264
00:28:44,298 --> 00:28:45,632
Mr. Klemmer!

265
00:28:56,677 --> 00:28:57,277
Hello,

266
00:28:57,611 --> 00:29:00,280
- Mr. Walter Klemmer?
- That's correct.

267
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,648
Please...

268
00:29:07,187 --> 00:29:09,256
Your programme
is particularly difficult.

269
00:29:09,489 --> 00:29:11,558
Where do you wish to begin?

270
00:29:11,825 --> 00:29:13,460
Wherever you prefer.

271
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,331
Professor, it's your class
that Mr. Klemmer wishes to join:

272
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:20,200
which piece
would you like to hear first?

273
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,070
don't mind.
The first on the list.

274
00:29:24,204 --> 00:29:25,672
Go ahead.

275
00:31:54,421 --> 00:31:55,689
Well?

276
00:31:55,856 --> 00:31:57,658
Stunningly brilliant.

277
00:31:58,225 --> 00:32:00,394
No, seriously,
I think it wasn't too bad.

278
00:32:00,928 --> 00:32:02,863
He just put "private lessons".

279
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:04,765
That's even more remarkable.

280
00:32:05,199 --> 00:32:09,236
I don't know how seriously
he takes his engineering

281
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:12,339
but for someone whose priority
is not the piano, bravo.

282
00:32:12,739 --> 00:32:13,774
It's amazing.

283
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:16,577
I quite agree.
He truly is very talented.

284
00:32:16,877 --> 00:32:18,078
Ladies? Gentlemen?

285
00:32:18,445 --> 00:32:20,781
- I vote for.
- Yes, me too.

286
00:32:21,081 --> 00:32:22,482
No doubt about it.

287
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:24,184
What do you say?

288
00:32:24,585 --> 00:32:28,488
Your opinion counts most.
He's applying to join your class.

289
00:32:29,957 --> 00:32:33,160
After such euphoria,
it's hard to voice reservations.

290
00:32:34,328 --> 00:32:37,097
I can't say
I totally share your enthusiasm.

291
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:40,500
Clearly he doesn't lack talent
but I wonder,

292
00:32:40,934 --> 00:32:43,070
and I ask you,
what does he expect from us?

293
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:46,006
For a professional career,
he's too old.

294
00:32:46,707 --> 00:32:50,410
By accepting him, we'll reject
a more motivated student.

295
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:55,883
And, frankly, I find his histrionics
suspicious or even unpleasant.

296
00:32:56,717 --> 00:32:58,952
I don't see what you mean.

297
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,590
In the Andantino, there were
no histrionics, as you put it.

298
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:06,727
Everyone knows
our views on Schubert diverge.

299
00:33:07,094 --> 00:33:10,097
Please, let's not waste time.
20 people are waiting.

300
00:33:10,364 --> 00:33:13,367
I feel unable
to nurture the artistic temperament

301
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,002
or virtuosity of Mr. Klemmer.

302
00:34:43,657 --> 00:34:45,058
Dinner's ready!

303
00:34:52,766 --> 00:34:54,535
Coming, Mama!

304
00:36:54,187 --> 00:36:56,623
Sit down, I'll bring the sauce.

305
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,162
Can I switch off the TV?

306
00:37:02,296 --> 00:37:03,964
If it bothers you.

307
00:37:14,841 --> 00:37:16,677
Don't you like that?

308
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:20,581
I'm tired.

309
00:37:20,781 --> 00:37:22,015
You look it.

310
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:24,418
Are the auditions so exhausting?

311
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:27,521
Boring, rather.

312
00:37:28,589 --> 00:37:30,357
That's tiring, too.

313
00:37:33,527 --> 00:37:35,095
What's wrong with you?

314
00:37:35,896 --> 00:37:37,664
- What do you mean?
- Look.

315
00:37:38,966 --> 00:37:41,034
Is that why you're in a bad mood?

316
00:37:41,635 --> 00:37:43,537
You might be more careful.

317
00:37:44,171 --> 00:37:45,639
It's not very appetising.

318
00:37:46,807 --> 00:37:50,611
Mare on heat seeks ardent,
successful stallion,

319
00:37:50,677 --> 00:37:52,546
for jumping and dressage.

320
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,947
Must be 8 inches.

321
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:55,949
Hello, Mr. Naprawnik.

322
00:37:57,184 --> 00:37:58,485
Hello, teacher

323
00:38:09,263 --> 00:38:10,497
Who's she?

324
00:38:11,765 --> 00:38:13,634
My piano teacher.

325
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:20,274
Don't pick out
the inner voices so much.

326
00:38:20,641 --> 00:38:22,709
Do you know where the melody is?

327
00:38:26,713 --> 00:38:28,916
It sounds
as clear as a muddy windscreen.

328
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:32,352
Probably due to the images
lodged in your mind.

329
00:38:41,428 --> 00:38:45,399
You have one approach for Bach,
Beethoven and the others.

330
00:38:48,268 --> 00:38:50,704
What made you want to study music?

331
00:38:51,271 --> 00:38:54,408
Your meagre talent?
I assure you it's not worth it.

332
00:38:55,275 --> 00:38:57,544
Take a job playing in a strip joint

333
00:38:57,644 --> 00:38:59,546
and stop wasting my time.

334
00:39:00,414 --> 00:39:01,548
Teacher,

335
00:39:01,815 --> 00:39:02,883
What?

336
00:39:04,484 --> 00:39:06,853
- I'm sorry.
- What for?

337
00:39:07,688 --> 00:39:10,424
For earlier...
At the newsagents.

338
00:39:12,859 --> 00:39:14,094
Why?

339
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:18,866
Why are you sorry?

340
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,001
What for?

341
00:39:21,869 --> 00:39:23,003
It doesn't work like that.

342
00:39:23,871 --> 00:39:26,607
Sorry isn't enough,
if I don't know why.

343
00:39:28,075 --> 00:39:30,344
Are you sorry because you're a pig?

344
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:32,946
Or because your friends are pigs?

345
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:36,984
Or because all women are bitches
for making you a pig?

346
00:39:38,051 --> 00:39:40,187
Or just because you got caught?

347
00:39:45,492 --> 00:39:46,560
The lesson is ended.

348
00:39:49,496 --> 00:39:51,899
I propose
your mother comes to see me.

349
00:39:52,799 --> 00:39:55,168
Maybe she can shed
some light on this.

350
00:39:57,104 --> 00:39:58,539
Well?

351
00:39:59,473 --> 00:40:01,642
What are you sorry for?

352
00:40:02,643 --> 00:40:04,344
I'm listening.

353
00:40:06,146 --> 00:40:07,848
The silence is deafening.

354
00:40:09,249 --> 00:40:11,852
See you next time,
along with your mother.

355
00:40:12,052 --> 00:40:13,921
Now, please remove yourself.

356
00:40:14,321 --> 00:40:16,490
I'll need my break to recover.

357
00:40:32,139 --> 00:40:33,106
Goodbye.

358
00:41:08,041 --> 00:41:09,142
Yes!

359
00:41:12,012 --> 00:41:13,714
This time I'm expected.

360
00:41:13,881 --> 00:41:15,782
The break's not over yet.

361
00:41:16,383 --> 00:41:18,652
And the lesson hasn't begun.

362
00:41:19,186 --> 00:41:22,222
Can I take out my scores
while I'm waiting?

363
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:38,572
You know I voted against you?

364
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,073
No.

365
00:41:40,807 --> 00:41:43,677
I don't believe
you're serious about music

366
00:41:43,877 --> 00:41:46,446
but rather about the kudos
it brings.

367
00:41:46,613 --> 00:41:48,415
You know that's untrue.

368
00:41:50,951 --> 00:41:52,786
And even if it were true,

369
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,289
would it be such a shameful motive?

370
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:57,958
Yes.

371
00:42:02,462 --> 00:42:04,331
What have you brought?

372
00:42:06,533 --> 00:42:08,535
You should forget Schubert.

373
00:42:10,571 --> 00:42:13,740
- Schenberg is all...
- I fought to win your attention.

374
00:42:14,741 --> 00:42:15,842
Give me a chance.

375
00:42:15,909 --> 00:42:18,912
I know you're not as indifferent
as you pretend.

376
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,315
I neglected my studies for you.

377
00:42:21,848 --> 00:42:23,317
It's the truth!

378
00:42:23,784 --> 00:42:25,953
You may think it's ridiculous,

379
00:42:26,453 --> 00:42:28,722
but since the recital
at the Blonskys,

380
00:42:29,356 --> 00:42:34,161
I've had you stuck in my mind
like a nut on a bolt.

381
00:42:34,595 --> 00:42:37,231
I apologise for being so technical.

382
00:42:38,098 --> 00:42:40,100
I never intended to apply here.

383
00:42:40,367 --> 00:42:42,302
Stop lying, it won't wash.

384
00:42:43,237 --> 00:42:44,538
I'm not lying.

385
00:42:45,939 --> 00:42:48,408
For next time,
find a copy of Opus 19.

386
00:42:49,176 --> 00:42:51,078
Let's talk first.

387
00:42:52,246 --> 00:42:54,081
I can't see the point.

388
00:42:55,249 --> 00:42:58,619
Don't just stand there.
Sit down and begin.

389
00:43:04,024 --> 00:43:05,859
Is this your last lesson?

390
00:43:06,026 --> 00:43:07,294
Please.

391
00:43:07,461 --> 00:43:10,297
Pretend you have a migraine
or something.

392
00:43:10,464 --> 00:43:11,598
It's lovely out.

393
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:14,868
Either you play
or my migraine will end this lesson.

394
00:45:16,757 --> 00:45:18,358
It's bound to finish late.

395
00:45:18,425 --> 00:45:21,261
Today's
our first Mendelssohn rehearsal.

396
00:45:23,197 --> 00:45:27,868
So, don't call up every 5 minutes.
It's embarrassing.

397
00:45:28,001 --> 00:45:31,538
Viora of the Philharmonic's coming.
He'll think I'm a little girl.

398
00:45:34,775 --> 00:45:36,009
Is that clear?

399
00:45:36,143 --> 00:45:37,611
If it ends late, take a taxi.

400
00:45:39,279 --> 00:45:40,247
Yes Mama.

401
00:45:41,281 --> 00:45:41,949
Goodbye.

402
00:45:44,851 --> 00:45:48,755
I adore lying in the name of love.
I'm so happy for you.

403
00:45:48,922 --> 00:45:51,858
If she calls after 10, don't answer.
Is that okay?

404
00:45:51,959 --> 00:45:53,193
It will be a pleasure.

405
00:46:56,523 --> 00:46:59,026
Good evening, this is Mrs. Kohut.

406
00:46:59,126 --> 00:47:00,494
May I speak to my daughter?

407
00:50:22,462 --> 00:50:23,130
What's wrong?

408
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:26,934
What the...?

409
00:50:33,273 --> 00:50:34,208
Shit!

410
00:50:37,844 --> 00:50:39,546
Stay there!

411
00:50:41,148 --> 00:50:43,283
Stay there, cunt!

412
00:51:58,692 --> 00:52:00,294
Are you crazy or something?

413
00:52:02,529 --> 00:52:04,531
Your father died this afternoon.

414
00:52:14,942 --> 00:52:16,443
Above all, keep calm.

415
00:54:43,924 --> 00:54:45,893
It's so inconsiderate of you!

416
00:54:46,059 --> 00:54:47,594
Think of the consequences!

417
00:54:47,794 --> 00:54:50,597
Kind of you
to honour us with your presence.

418
00:54:51,431 --> 00:54:53,534
Might we know what kept you?

419
00:54:55,669 --> 00:54:57,905
Stop blubbing! What happened?

420
00:54:59,806 --> 00:55:01,141
I have diarrhoea.

421
00:55:01,675 --> 00:55:03,310
Are you scared or what?

422
00:55:06,313 --> 00:55:08,282
A pianist needs solid nerves.

423
00:55:08,448 --> 00:55:11,084
- How can I perform after...
- Don't overdo it.

424
00:55:11,318 --> 00:55:12,886
We should be going up.

425
00:55:15,322 --> 00:55:17,124
Don't be so pathetic.

426
00:55:17,691 --> 00:55:19,893
They won't bite. It's a rehearsal.

427
00:55:23,096 --> 00:55:25,098
Did I overestimate you?

428
01:01:43,343 --> 01:01:47,347
You think me devoid of sensitivity
and indeed I can be superficial.

429
01:01:47,581 --> 01:01:49,049
You see, I admit it.

430
01:01:50,350 --> 01:01:53,654
But telling me to forget Schubert
was atrociously unfair.

431
01:01:53,987 --> 01:01:55,489
It's quite the contrary.

432
01:01:55,722 --> 01:01:58,725
There are days,
like after our first lesson, when...

433
01:02:06,099 --> 01:02:08,602
The sight of blood makes me ill.
Go to her.

434
01:02:08,869 --> 01:02:10,470
Be her brave protector.

435
01:02:19,246 --> 01:02:20,714
- What happened?
- Let me.

436
01:02:21,248 --> 01:02:22,716
Call a doctor.

437
01:02:23,383 --> 01:02:27,054
Don't stare, there's nothing to see.
Go back to the hall.

438
01:04:17,898 --> 01:04:19,366
Come on.

439
01:04:22,035 --> 01:04:23,237
Wait.

440
01:04:23,770 --> 01:04:25,305
Why?

441
01:04:26,406 --> 01:04:28,008
Why?

442
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:48,028
Stop it!

443
01:04:58,005 --> 01:04:59,973
I told you to stop!

444
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:02,109
If you don't stop immediately,
I'll leave.

445
01:05:10,017 --> 01:05:11,852
Erika...

446
01:05:16,023 --> 01:05:18,158
Look at me, not your penis.

447
01:05:18,892 --> 01:05:20,360
Be quiet.

448
01:05:20,661 --> 01:05:22,763
Don't move or I'll leave.

449
01:05:42,316 --> 01:05:43,550
No.

450
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:48,555
Erika,
I love you.

451
01:05:48,956 --> 01:05:50,290
No one has...

452
01:05:51,325 --> 01:05:54,728
If you won't be quiet,
you'll end up all alone here.

453
01:05:55,229 --> 01:05:56,396
Why do you hurt me?

454
01:07:01,795 --> 01:07:03,163
I can't hold back.

455
01:07:03,430 --> 01:07:05,199
I said, silence!

456
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:08,535
Keep going. Come here.

457
01:07:34,595 --> 01:07:36,797
That's it. It's coming.

458
01:07:37,464 --> 01:07:39,533
Keep going. Don't stop!

459
01:07:41,201 --> 01:07:43,804
I'll write down
what you can do to me.

460
01:07:44,338 --> 01:07:47,941
All my desires on paper
for you to peruse at will.

461
01:07:48,475 --> 01:07:49,943
You don't like that?

462
01:07:50,477 --> 01:07:52,279
You can't leave me like this.

463
01:07:52,713 --> 01:07:54,081
Come on.

464
01:07:54,481 --> 01:07:56,817
I've no desire to touch that now.

465
01:07:57,217 --> 01:07:58,452
Keep going, please.

466
01:07:58,852 --> 01:08:00,687
Out of the question!

467
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:08,161
Hands off.

468
01:08:08,729 --> 01:08:11,565
Or we never see each other again.

469
01:08:14,635 --> 01:08:16,937
It's totally sick
what you're doing here.

470
01:08:17,538 --> 01:08:19,406
And it hurts!

471
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:21,475
I sympathise.

472
01:08:32,452 --> 01:08:33,787
Stop it.

473
01:08:34,054 --> 01:08:36,290
Don't be stupid.
You're spoiling it.

474
01:08:49,136 --> 01:08:50,871
I won't touch you again.

475
01:08:54,708 --> 01:08:57,110
I want you to stay like that,
that's all.

476
01:08:59,646 --> 01:09:01,315
Facing me!

477
01:09:07,888 --> 01:09:09,723
Don't put it away.

478
01:09:16,530 --> 01:09:18,098
It's not me who's stupid.

479
01:09:19,533 --> 01:09:21,235
It's you.

480
01:09:22,769 --> 01:09:25,239
You should know
what you can and can't do to a man.

481
01:09:25,772 --> 01:09:27,708
- You bitch!
- Shut up!

482
01:09:28,408 --> 01:09:31,511
The playing field has to be level.

483
01:09:32,779 --> 01:09:34,248
If you think...

484
01:09:36,550 --> 01:09:37,751
Wait.

485
01:09:39,419 --> 01:09:41,221
I won't move, I promise.

486
01:09:42,189 --> 01:09:43,657
I won't say a word.

487
01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:05,372
You will receive my instructions.

488
01:11:06,273 --> 01:11:07,674
By letter.

489
01:11:08,876 --> 01:11:11,411
Or face to face.
Or maybe over the phone.

490
01:11:14,514 --> 01:11:16,416
Now, you can put it away.

491
01:11:17,784 --> 01:11:19,253
Facing me.

492
01:12:15,008 --> 01:12:16,977
How about a little smile?

493
01:12:18,378 --> 01:12:19,713
Go on.

494
01:12:20,380 --> 01:12:22,816
Don't be so serious, pretty lady.

495
01:12:24,251 --> 01:12:25,719
Go on.

496
01:12:44,571 --> 01:12:47,374
Next time, we'll do much better.
I promise.

497
01:12:49,209 --> 01:12:51,578
Practice will make you perfect.

498
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:57,284
At least 2 months, with no guarantee
of complete recovery.

499
01:12:57,851 --> 01:12:59,219
That's terrible.

500
01:12:59,853 --> 01:13:04,191
And she really was quite good.
She has the nerve.

501
01:13:04,491 --> 01:13:08,729
She played amazingly yesterday
despite nearly not making it.

502
01:13:10,998 --> 01:13:13,267
Pull yourself together.
You're no use to Anna

503
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:15,536
if you break down like that.

504
01:13:18,739 --> 01:13:20,707
For the moment, we must wait.

505
01:13:21,508 --> 01:13:23,343
She mustn't neglect her left hand.

506
01:13:23,610 --> 01:13:25,612
That's always her weak point.

507
01:13:26,013 --> 01:13:27,981
Also, she'll be scarred for life.

508
01:13:28,248 --> 01:13:31,018
Just imagine.
A pianist with a disfigured hand.

509
01:13:31,251 --> 01:13:33,220
She's hardly attractive.
Her only attribute

510
01:13:33,387 --> 01:13:34,855
was her talent.

511
01:13:35,522 --> 01:13:37,624
That's why we sacrificed everything.

512
01:13:38,025 --> 01:13:39,960
She sacrificed everything.

513
01:13:41,028 --> 01:13:42,396
Sorry?

514
01:13:42,930 --> 01:13:45,999
You said we.
It's Anna who sacrificed everything.

515
01:13:46,433 --> 01:13:47,935
Yes, naturally.

516
01:13:48,535 --> 01:13:50,204
Who would do such a thing?

517
01:13:50,804 --> 01:13:53,974
The police say it must have been
another student

518
01:13:54,308 --> 01:13:55,709
acting out of jealousy.

519
01:13:57,945 --> 01:14:00,013
Can you imagine it?

520
01:14:00,447 --> 01:14:02,249
Being so evil?

521
01:14:03,150 --> 01:14:06,420
She's always been a loner.
She hardly has any friends.

522
01:14:06,653 --> 01:14:08,922
They'll find the man who did it.

523
01:14:09,323 --> 01:14:11,692
He deserves his hands chopping off.

524
01:14:12,059 --> 01:14:16,697
My next lesson is waiting.
I'll have to ask you to leave.

525
01:14:16,964 --> 01:14:20,167
Tell Anna she's welcome to drop in
when she's better.

526
01:14:25,706 --> 01:14:27,841
Remind her about her left hand.

527
01:14:28,208 --> 01:14:30,744
I'll tell her.
Thank you very much.

528
01:14:31,478 --> 01:14:33,914
She'll come by.
She admires you so much.

529
01:14:34,081 --> 01:14:35,916
Chin up, Mrs. Schober.

530
01:14:38,018 --> 01:14:40,387
Who will replace Anna
for the concert?

531
01:14:41,154 --> 01:14:42,389
No one.

532
01:14:43,023 --> 01:14:45,292
No student could
at such short notice.

533
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:49,129
I've been asked to stand in
for the singer's sake.

534
01:14:49,396 --> 01:14:51,565
That's very good.
Anna will be pleased.

535
01:14:51,798 --> 01:14:53,000
Goodbye teacher.

536
01:16:09,977 --> 01:16:11,211
Stop.

537
01:16:18,118 --> 01:16:19,453
Back to the beginning.

538
01:16:26,727 --> 01:16:29,897
You gladly ignore the dynamics.
What does it say?

539
01:16:30,731 --> 01:16:33,000
- Piano.
- Exactly. And then?

540
01:16:35,002 --> 01:16:36,370
Forte-piano.

541
01:16:36,637 --> 01:16:37,738
And then?

542
01:16:38,005 --> 01:16:38,805
Pianissimo.

543
01:16:39,072 --> 01:16:40,173
And diminuendo

544
01:16:40,641 --> 01:16:42,109
and mezzo-forte, forte,

545
01:16:42,376 --> 01:16:44,811
fortissimo, sforzatissimo.

546
01:16:44,945 --> 01:16:48,649
Schubert's dynamics range from
scream to whisper not loud to soft.

547
01:16:49,116 --> 01:16:52,719
Anarchy hardly seems your forte.
Why not stick to Clementi?

548
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:55,889
Schubert was quite ugly.
Did you know?

549
01:16:57,057 --> 01:16:59,793
With your looks,
nothing can ever hurt you.

550
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:02,329
Why destroy
what could bring us together?

551
01:17:06,733 --> 01:17:09,570
- Mannerism is no...
- Why can't I look at you?

552
01:17:10,103 --> 01:17:14,274
Because if I do, I won't resist the
temptation to kiss you on the neck.

553
01:17:15,542 --> 01:17:17,911
May I kiss you on the neck?

554
01:17:38,932 --> 01:17:40,968
Can I get you a glass of water?

555
01:18:01,521 --> 01:18:02,823
Thanks.

556
01:18:04,625 --> 01:18:06,393
When can I see you?

557
01:18:07,961 --> 01:18:09,162
Let's call each other.

558
01:18:10,531 --> 01:18:12,499
Let's go away this weekend.
Just you and l.

559
01:18:13,133 --> 01:18:15,235
I can't,
I'm going out with my mother.

560
01:18:15,402 --> 01:18:16,503
Cancel.

561
01:18:16,770 --> 01:18:19,106
Forget your mother. Think of us.

562
01:18:19,406 --> 01:18:21,041
We must make up for lost time.

563
01:18:21,208 --> 01:18:24,077
Do you mean me?
I must make up for lost time?

564
01:18:24,545 --> 01:18:27,180
Darling!
Stop always thinking of others,

565
01:18:27,414 --> 01:18:29,583
your mother, your scruples...

566
01:18:30,217 --> 01:18:33,620
You talk of anarchy
but sacrifice love to be with Mama.

567
01:18:34,288 --> 01:18:37,558
Let yourself go.
Allow yourself feelings for once.

568
01:18:37,858 --> 01:18:39,459
Don't be such a leech.

569
01:18:45,566 --> 01:18:47,267
You cough because you're uptight.

570
01:18:47,501 --> 01:18:50,003
I have no feelings.
Get that into your head.

571
01:18:50,270 --> 01:18:53,207
If ever I do,
they won't defeat my intelligence.

572
01:18:55,075 --> 01:18:57,110
I love you.
Don't be so cowardly.

573
01:18:58,712 --> 01:19:01,448
Is what you've written
just as cowardly?

574
01:19:05,986 --> 01:19:07,454
Don't touch it!

575
01:19:07,988 --> 01:19:09,423
Not now.

576
01:19:10,657 --> 01:19:13,193
I want you to read it alone.

577
01:19:15,429 --> 01:19:17,397
Now, get stuck in to Schubert.

578
01:19:17,664 --> 01:19:20,133
That's all you may do in this room.

579
01:19:35,916 --> 01:19:37,317
Piano.

580
01:19:38,986 --> 01:19:41,655
Brahms would say:
Con intimissimo sentimento.

581
01:20:34,274 --> 01:20:35,609
Erika!

582
01:20:42,349 --> 01:20:44,251
Are you mad? What are you doing?

583
01:20:44,518 --> 01:20:46,220
I followed you.

584
01:20:46,486 --> 01:20:48,288
I said we'd speak on the phone.

585
01:20:48,488 --> 01:20:51,558
You can't drive me crazy like that
and then run off.

586
01:20:52,359 --> 01:20:54,194
Drive you crazy?

587
01:20:54,494 --> 01:20:58,298
Let's go somewhere
where we can talk in private.

588
01:21:00,434 --> 01:21:02,269
Did you read the letter?

589
01:21:03,303 --> 01:21:06,073
I don't want any letters.
I want us to talk!

590
01:21:08,542 --> 01:21:10,410
I advise you to leave now.

591
01:21:12,679 --> 01:21:14,982
Never hound the woman
you claim to love.

592
01:21:15,315 --> 01:21:17,618
You should know that,
even at your age.

593
01:21:18,252 --> 01:21:20,087
If you value my affection, go.

594
01:21:20,454 --> 01:21:23,457
I'll call you tomorrow
to fix a date. Okay?

595
01:21:23,957 --> 01:21:25,759
- Take your hat off.
- What?

596
01:21:57,991 --> 01:21:59,326
Good evening.

597
01:21:59,860 --> 01:22:02,663
I have matters to discuss
with Mr. Klemmer.

598
01:22:03,597 --> 01:22:05,432
What's that supposed to mean?

599
01:22:05,799 --> 01:22:08,468
We won't bother you.
We'll talk in my room.

600
01:22:08,735 --> 01:22:09,636
Come on.

601
01:22:11,238 --> 01:22:12,139
Excuse me.

602
01:22:12,873 --> 01:22:15,409
If you try to come in,
you'll be sorry.

603
01:22:16,009 --> 01:22:18,212
There's no food in.
I didn't expect visitors.

604
01:22:18,679 --> 01:22:21,215
Don't put yourself out,
I've already eaten.

605
01:23:02,356 --> 01:23:03,390
Come here.

606
01:23:09,363 --> 01:23:11,031
First, read the letter.

607
01:23:16,470 --> 01:23:17,671
You've still got it?

608
01:23:17,671 --> 01:23:18,205
Yes.

609
01:23:20,040 --> 01:23:22,042
So, read it now, please.

610
01:23:22,809 --> 01:23:24,545
Do you want to finish me off?

611
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:27,681
I said
I don't want to read any letters.

612
01:23:28,315 --> 01:23:30,183
I'm here, you're here.

613
01:23:30,684 --> 01:23:32,619
We're made of flesh and blood.

614
01:23:34,755 --> 01:23:36,690
Don't be so scared.

615
01:23:36,890 --> 01:23:39,893
I'm not. I want all you want.
But read it first.

616
01:23:45,666 --> 01:23:47,768
Is that why we barricaded the door?

617
01:23:48,168 --> 01:23:49,069
Perhaps.

618
01:23:50,404 --> 01:23:51,638
Erika...

619
01:23:51,972 --> 01:23:53,073
Please!

620
01:23:54,608 --> 01:23:57,978
I don't know how much longer
I want to play this game.

621
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:11,592
Heavy.

622
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:15,462
Sit down there, please.

623
01:25:38,378 --> 01:25:41,515
On the contrary, if I beg,
tighten my bonds, please.

624
01:25:42,749 --> 01:25:45,986
Adjust the belt
by at least 2 or 3 holes.

625
01:25:46,587 --> 01:25:48,455
The tighter the better.

626
01:25:49,389 --> 01:25:53,160
Then, gag me with some
stockings I will have ready.

627
01:25:54,828 --> 01:25:57,631
tuff them in so hard
that I'm incapable...

628
01:25:58,131 --> 01:26:00,234
of making any sound.

629
01:26:02,035 --> 01:26:04,371
Next, take off the blindfold,
please,

630
01:26:05,339 --> 01:26:07,741
and sit down on my face

631
01:26:09,142 --> 01:26:11,645
and punch me in the stomach

632
01:26:12,479 --> 01:26:15,816
to force me
to thrust my tongue in your behind.

633
01:26:37,204 --> 01:26:39,106
Is this supposed to be serious?

634
01:26:41,575 --> 01:26:43,510
You're making fun of me, aren't you?

635
01:26:45,879 --> 01:26:47,347
You want a slap?

636
01:27:08,001 --> 01:27:09,937
For that is my dearest wish.

637
01:27:09,937 --> 01:27:12,839
Hands and feet tied behind my back

638
01:27:13,173 --> 01:27:15,242
and locked up next door
to my mother

639
01:27:15,509 --> 01:27:19,379
but out of her reach
behind my bedroom door,

640
01:27:19,813 --> 01:27:21,381
till the next morning.

641
01:27:22,616 --> 01:27:25,419
Don't worry about my mother,
she's my problem.

642
01:27:27,187 --> 01:27:30,591
Take all the door keys
with you from the apartment.

643
01:27:30,891 --> 01:27:32,926
Don't leave a single one here.

644
01:27:33,126 --> 01:27:35,629
What will all this open up for me?

645
01:27:43,737 --> 01:27:47,507
Maybe you'd open your cultured
mouth and comment on this shit.

646
01:27:47,808 --> 01:27:48,375
No?

647
01:28:06,326 --> 01:28:09,796
If you catch me
disobeying any of your orders,

648
01:28:10,564 --> 01:28:12,699
hit me, please,

649
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:15,736
even with the back of your hand
on my face.

650
01:28:18,972 --> 01:28:21,475
Ask me why I don't cry out
to mother

651
01:28:21,742 --> 01:28:24,611
or why I don't fight back.

652
01:28:24,945 --> 01:28:27,214
Above all, say things like that,

653
01:28:27,748 --> 01:28:31,018
so that I realise
just how powerless I am.

654
01:28:31,818 --> 01:28:33,687
What's going on in there?

655
01:28:33,954 --> 01:28:35,989
Open up! Move that chest.

656
01:28:36,056 --> 01:28:37,891
Don't you want to let her in?

657
01:28:37,991 --> 01:28:40,027
Do you want me
to hit you in front of her?

658
01:28:40,561 --> 01:28:43,897
Calm down!
Be quiet and watch the TV!

659
01:28:44,064 --> 01:28:45,766
Open up or you'll be sorry.

660
01:28:45,899 --> 01:28:46,967
Stop making a fuss!

661
01:28:47,100 --> 01:28:48,435
Incredible!

662
01:28:49,503 --> 01:28:51,004
Erika!

663
01:28:55,309 --> 01:28:57,611
Do you have no sense of decency?

664
01:28:57,878 --> 01:28:59,980
Invading people's homes like this.

665
01:29:00,180 --> 01:29:02,316
The sheer nerve of it!

666
01:31:18,318 --> 01:31:20,153
Are you angry with me?

667
01:31:22,823 --> 01:31:24,591
I hope you're not.

668
01:31:25,826 --> 01:31:28,362
It's not very well written, I know.

669
01:31:29,263 --> 01:31:32,432
I'm a pianist, not a poet.

670
01:31:34,468 --> 01:31:37,437
After all,
love is built on banal things.

671
01:31:41,074 --> 01:31:44,111
Think it over.
You have my phone number.

672
01:31:48,782 --> 01:31:51,885
Like I said,
I want everything you want.

673
01:31:53,387 --> 01:31:55,122
I have all we need.

674
01:31:59,593 --> 01:32:01,895
But it can wait till tomorrow.

675
01:32:10,137 --> 01:32:11,638
Aren't you talking to me?

676
01:32:17,778 --> 01:32:19,780
Do I disgust you?

677
01:32:22,216 --> 01:32:24,151
That's not necessary.

678
01:32:25,586 --> 01:32:28,455
The urge to be beaten
has been in me for years.

679
01:32:35,095 --> 01:32:37,030
I waited for you, you know?

680
01:32:41,001 --> 01:32:43,604
It's not a joke, all I wrote.
You know that.

681
01:32:46,573 --> 01:32:48,976
From now on, you give the orders.

682
01:32:52,913 --> 01:32:56,049
From now on,
you choose what I am to wear.

683
01:32:56,650 --> 01:32:59,019
What colour do you prefer?
You never said.

684
01:33:03,790 --> 01:33:05,926
You're not talking to me?
You're angry?

685
01:33:11,465 --> 01:33:13,000
Say something then.

686
01:33:15,302 --> 01:33:16,503
You're sick.

687
01:33:18,005 --> 01:33:19,640
You need treatment.

688
01:33:31,518 --> 01:33:33,554
If you want to hit me, hit me.

689
01:33:36,790 --> 01:33:38,859
I don't want to soil my hands.

690
01:33:40,661 --> 01:33:43,764
No one would touch your sort,
even with gloves on.

691
01:33:53,540 --> 01:33:55,475
I swear I loved you.

692
01:33:57,411 --> 01:33:59,613
You don't even know what it is.

693
01:34:01,315 --> 01:34:03,483
Right now, you repulse me.

694
01:34:07,321 --> 01:34:08,889
Fuck it.

695
01:34:25,205 --> 01:34:27,741
...came to North America
with the Spanish.

696
01:34:27,941 --> 01:34:30,711
Left to roam free,
they became the famous Mustang.

697
01:34:31,078 --> 01:34:35,048
Today's cowboys' most loyal
companion is the quarter horse.

698
01:34:35,215 --> 01:34:39,519
Very fast over short distances
and with good stamina...

699
01:35:16,156 --> 01:35:18,258
You really are quite shameless.

700
01:35:22,296 --> 01:35:24,331
What have you done with him?

701
01:35:27,067 --> 01:35:28,969
Is he still in your room?

702
01:35:31,572 --> 01:35:33,507
It wouldn't surprise me.

703
01:35:35,275 --> 01:35:37,377
Nothing surprises me any more.

704
01:35:45,686 --> 01:35:47,454
But you can do what you want.

705
01:35:48,088 --> 01:35:49,456
At your age.

706
01:35:58,799 --> 01:36:00,133
Good Lord.

707
01:36:02,669 --> 01:36:04,771
All those sacrifices for this.

708
01:36:07,541 --> 01:36:09,776
That's what you get in reward.

709
01:36:16,917 --> 01:36:19,052
You carry on like that.

710
01:36:19,419 --> 01:36:22,556
You can set up a bordello here.

711
01:36:24,157 --> 01:36:26,627
Who cares
what the neighbours think!

712
01:36:27,427 --> 01:36:29,429
As always, you do as you like!

713
01:36:29,930 --> 01:36:31,298
I love you.

714
01:36:31,932 --> 01:36:34,301
Stop that! Have you gone insane?

715
01:36:35,168 --> 01:36:36,503
What are you...

716
01:36:37,170 --> 01:36:38,639
Stop it!

717
01:36:39,806 --> 01:36:43,143
Don't be so filthy,
you're out of your mind!

718
01:36:43,544 --> 01:36:45,979
Shut up. I love you.

719
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:48,282
I love you, too.

720
01:36:49,449 --> 01:36:51,518
But stop this now.

721
01:36:54,688 --> 01:36:56,023
You're mad!

722
01:37:39,266 --> 01:37:40,968
You're mad.

723
01:37:42,636 --> 01:37:44,371
You're completely mad.

724
01:37:56,783 --> 01:37:58,619
Go to sleep now.

725
01:38:01,922 --> 01:38:04,524
You're going to need
all your energy.

726
01:38:07,027 --> 01:38:10,497
Even if you're just standing in,
you must be well prepared.

727
01:38:12,933 --> 01:38:15,469
You never know
who might be in the audience.

728
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:48,702
I saw the hairs on your sex.

729
01:40:06,780 --> 01:40:07,981
Walter!

730
01:40:08,282 --> 01:40:09,716
Can I have a word?

731
01:40:10,017 --> 01:40:11,919
Someone to see you.

732
01:40:14,755 --> 01:40:16,957
Is that your little sister?

733
01:40:17,391 --> 01:40:19,126
Don't run away, he's coming.

734
01:40:29,903 --> 01:40:31,872
- What do you want?
- Speak to you.

735
01:40:33,273 --> 01:40:34,575
I'm listening.

736
01:40:35,642 --> 01:40:37,411
Not here, I can't.

737
01:40:38,412 --> 01:40:39,646
Over there.

738
01:40:43,917 --> 01:40:45,986
How did you manage to find me?

739
01:40:48,422 --> 01:40:49,656
Just there.

740
01:40:50,524 --> 01:40:51,858
Go on in.

741
01:40:59,800 --> 01:41:01,869
Forgive me for the letter.

742
01:41:03,036 --> 01:41:07,207
I'm an idiot. I shouldn't have
done that to you out of the blue.

743
01:41:09,543 --> 01:41:11,845
Like you said,
we should have talked first.

744
01:41:22,022 --> 01:41:23,624
Forgive me.

745
01:41:28,028 --> 01:41:29,363
What are you doing?

746
01:41:30,030 --> 01:41:32,232
Stop it. Get up now.

747
01:41:32,766 --> 01:41:34,101
Come on.

748
01:41:35,402 --> 01:41:36,703
Come on top of me.

749
01:41:38,038 --> 01:41:40,340
- You want me, don't you?
- You're mad.

750
01:41:41,675 --> 01:41:43,944
Come on. I love you.

751
01:41:45,546 --> 01:41:48,048
I'll never write anything
you don't want.

752
01:41:48,682 --> 01:41:50,984
You tell me what you want, okay?

753
01:41:51,785 --> 01:41:53,020
come!

754
01:41:53,186 --> 01:41:56,023
Someone might come in.
You're being ridiculous.

755
01:41:56,290 --> 01:41:57,891
Get up.

756
01:42:04,531 --> 01:42:06,266
Hang on, let me do it.

757
01:42:07,634 --> 01:42:09,503
Let me do it, I said.

758
01:42:13,907 --> 01:42:15,409
wait!

759
01:42:19,546 --> 01:42:21,048
Here.

760
01:42:32,292 --> 01:42:33,794
I can't, not here.

761
01:42:33,860 --> 01:42:35,462
Stop it. I can't.

762
01:42:36,263 --> 01:42:38,832
- It doesn't matter.
- I can't do it here.

763
01:42:43,203 --> 01:42:45,672
I know you want to protect us,

764
01:42:45,772 --> 01:42:49,376
but I don't care if people catch us.
I don't care.

765
01:42:49,910 --> 01:42:51,378
I love you.

766
01:43:08,428 --> 01:43:09,897
I love you, too.

767
01:43:24,711 --> 01:43:26,313
Come on.

768
01:43:37,824 --> 01:43:39,293
You have to help me.

769
01:44:12,726 --> 01:44:15,462
- I don't believe it.
- I'm sorry.

770
01:44:18,098 --> 01:44:19,533
Don't look.

771
01:44:22,236 --> 01:44:24,037
Don't look.

772
01:44:42,356 --> 01:44:44,324
I must really disgust you.

773
01:44:44,491 --> 01:44:47,261
- No woman ever puked it back.
- Sorry.

774
01:44:47,361 --> 01:44:49,663
I don't know what happened.

775
01:44:53,967 --> 01:44:55,502
I'm clean.

776
01:45:00,641 --> 01:45:01,942
I'm all clean.

777
01:45:03,143 --> 01:45:04,411
Like a baby.

778
01:45:05,879 --> 01:45:07,714
Inside as well as outside.

779
01:45:07,781 --> 01:45:10,117
For you and thanks to you, darling.

780
01:45:11,451 --> 01:45:13,620
Do you like me calling you darling?

781
01:45:13,820 --> 01:45:15,656
It's absolutely marvellous.

782
01:45:16,323 --> 01:45:18,091
You must be patient.

783
01:45:18,158 --> 01:45:21,695
I'll give you all the names,
we'll play all the games you want.

784
01:45:23,163 --> 01:45:24,798
You know you really stink?

785
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:30,737
Sorry, you stink so much,
no one will ever come close to you.

786
01:45:30,837 --> 01:45:34,641
You'd better leave town
until you don't stink so bad.

787
01:45:36,043 --> 01:45:37,611
Rinse your mouth more often,

788
01:45:37,678 --> 01:45:39,980
not just when my cock
makes you puke.

789
01:46:25,259 --> 01:46:26,293
Who is it?

790
01:46:26,460 --> 01:46:27,294
Open up.

791
01:46:29,096 --> 01:46:31,131
- Open up now!
- What do you want?

792
01:46:32,699 --> 01:46:34,234
I said, open the door!

793
01:46:36,403 --> 01:46:38,639
Quiet!
You'll wake the whole building.

794
01:46:38,839 --> 01:46:40,040
I'm opening it.

795
01:46:46,413 --> 01:46:47,514
Don't do that again, okay?

796
01:46:47,614 --> 01:46:51,151
- What do you mean?
- Shut up, you sad cow!

797
01:46:52,286 --> 01:46:53,921
Just then,

798
01:46:54,054 --> 01:46:55,889
I was under your window

799
01:46:55,989 --> 01:47:00,360
and I was jerking off.
That's what you want, huh?

800
01:47:00,494 --> 01:47:03,230
You want to...
Is that it?

801
01:47:05,199 --> 01:47:08,936
You're a witch, a pervert!

802
01:47:09,836 --> 01:47:12,906
You want to give everyone
your illness, don't you?

803
01:47:13,173 --> 01:47:14,474
- Not me!
- I did apologise.

804
01:47:14,741 --> 01:47:16,677
Fuck your stupid apologies!

805
01:47:16,910 --> 01:47:19,279
Wasn't last night enough for you?

806
01:47:19,613 --> 01:47:23,317
Will you make this a habit?
Screaming the house down.

807
01:47:23,550 --> 01:47:25,018
Go back to bed!

808
01:47:25,252 --> 01:47:26,220
Walter, please.

809
01:47:26,420 --> 01:47:28,655
- Get out!
- Be off with you! Now!

810
01:47:28,855 --> 01:47:30,257
Not as you imagined?

811
01:47:30,490 --> 01:47:32,059
We'll see about this.

812
01:47:32,292 --> 01:47:34,595
The police will put a stop to this.

813
01:47:35,562 --> 01:47:37,564
This is nothing to do with you.

814
01:47:43,003 --> 01:47:44,504
Forget your mother.

815
01:47:45,005 --> 01:47:47,441
We have time. We have all night.

816
01:47:52,379 --> 01:47:54,514
Let's pick up where we left off.

817
01:47:55,048 --> 01:47:57,317
Is this really
what you had imagined?

818
01:47:58,252 --> 01:47:59,086
No.

819
01:47:59,820 --> 01:48:01,421
What then?

820
01:48:02,122 --> 01:48:03,190
You'll be sorry.

821
01:48:03,323 --> 01:48:06,360
Just because we're women doesn't
mean you'll get away with it.

822
01:48:06,894 --> 01:48:07,761
Let me go.

823
01:48:11,231 --> 01:48:12,699
This is unbelievable!

824
01:48:13,867 --> 01:48:16,203
At least this one has a key.

825
01:48:17,004 --> 01:48:17,638
Open up!

826
01:48:17,938 --> 01:48:20,307
How about one
for your daughter's room?

827
01:48:20,674 --> 01:48:21,275
Open up!

828
01:48:22,676 --> 01:48:24,344
That's that dealt with.

829
01:48:25,812 --> 01:48:29,917
As for my mother,
pay no attention to her. Yes?

830
01:48:31,552 --> 01:48:33,520
Am I quoting you exactly?

831
01:48:35,556 --> 01:48:37,024
Open up!

832
01:48:39,026 --> 01:48:40,260
You will see!

833
01:48:47,334 --> 01:48:48,869
Give me lots of slaps, darling.

834
01:48:51,271 --> 01:48:52,539
Hit me hard... No.

835
01:48:52,706 --> 01:48:55,209
Hit me around the face
and hit me hard.

836
01:48:59,646 --> 01:49:01,548
At your service, dear lady.

837
01:49:07,821 --> 01:49:09,456
Is that what you want?

838
01:49:09,590 --> 01:49:10,457
Stop, please.

839
01:49:13,393 --> 01:49:14,361
What then?

840
01:49:14,595 --> 01:49:17,130
Not that. Stop, I beg you.

841
01:49:24,204 --> 01:49:26,073
What are you doing?

842
01:49:26,206 --> 01:49:27,908
- Shut it or I kill her!
- Murderer!

843
01:49:28,342 --> 01:49:29,710
Stop.

844
01:49:34,815 --> 01:49:37,017
- Where's the water?
- In the kitchen.

845
01:49:41,755 --> 01:49:43,624
Don't think you'll get me going...

846
01:49:43,891 --> 01:49:45,926
by flashing your pathetic body.

847
01:50:02,943 --> 01:50:04,511
You know,

848
01:50:04,778 --> 01:50:07,948
I do realise
that all this isn't very nice of me.

849
01:50:10,817 --> 01:50:14,655
But if you're honest, you'll admit
you're partly responsible.

850
01:50:17,224 --> 01:50:19,626
I mean, it's true...

851
01:50:20,027 --> 01:50:21,228
Yes or no?

852
01:50:21,595 --> 01:50:22,196
Yes.

853
01:50:22,596 --> 01:50:24,097
Am I right?

854
01:50:24,598 --> 01:50:25,832
Yes, Walter.

855
01:50:30,404 --> 01:50:31,772
Erika?

856
01:50:32,039 --> 01:50:33,040
Yes.

857
01:50:33,273 --> 01:50:36,443
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay

858
01:50:36,543 --> 01:50:39,746
You can't get a guy going,
then take refuge on the ice.

859
01:50:57,831 --> 01:50:59,933
Not my face! Not my hands!

860
01:51:01,201 --> 01:51:02,769
Murderer!

861
01:51:04,271 --> 01:51:06,039
Aren't you ashamed?

862
01:51:07,474 --> 01:51:09,576
I'm begging you to stop.

863
01:51:11,044 --> 01:51:12,980
Don't touch my daughter.

864
01:51:14,982 --> 01:51:17,417
Leave my daughter alone.

865
01:51:19,186 --> 01:51:21,221
I'm begging you.

866
01:51:21,788 --> 01:51:23,824
Why do you do that?

867
01:51:24,391 --> 01:51:28,095
I calm down
and you try to cross me.

868
01:51:29,396 --> 01:51:31,532
Be a little cooperative, fuck it.

869
01:51:35,102 --> 01:51:37,604
I'd be happy to learn to play.

870
01:51:38,472 --> 01:51:41,275
But not if we only ever play
by your rules.

871
01:51:43,744 --> 01:51:47,047
You can't delve around
inside people, then reject them.

872
01:51:59,860 --> 01:52:02,462
Be nice to me, please.

873
01:52:07,334 --> 01:52:09,603
You can't let me go just like that.

874
01:53:40,027 --> 01:53:41,628
Stop, please.

875
01:53:42,162 --> 01:53:44,298
You have to give a bit.

876
01:54:11,825 --> 01:54:14,161
You can't leave me all alone now.

877
01:54:14,828 --> 01:54:16,563
Love me, please.

878
01:54:43,991 --> 01:54:46,660
Are you trying to tell me
I should go?

879
01:55:50,891 --> 01:55:53,727
I'd appreciate it
if you tell no one.

880
01:55:55,362 --> 01:55:57,731
Anyhow, it's for your own good.

881
01:56:03,670 --> 01:56:05,939
You can't humiliate
a man that way and...

882
01:56:06,874 --> 01:56:08,542
It's not possible.

883
01:56:19,353 --> 01:56:21,054
Will you be alright?

884
01:56:25,225 --> 01:56:27,194
Do you need anything?

885
01:56:27,561 --> 01:56:28,795
Okay?

886
01:56:30,864 --> 01:56:33,700
You know, love isn't everything.

887
01:56:37,571 --> 01:56:38,906
See you, then.

888
01:56:49,683 --> 01:56:51,485
Has he gone?

889
01:56:52,486 --> 01:56:54,454
Say something. Has he gone?

890
01:56:56,189 --> 01:56:57,591
Erika.

891
01:56:57,758 --> 01:56:59,226
Open the door.

892
01:57:00,994 --> 01:57:02,396
What's wrong?

893
01:57:03,497 --> 01:57:05,098
Talk to me, for God's sake.

894
01:57:38,999 --> 01:57:40,834
Oh my God, child!

895
01:57:41,001 --> 01:57:42,703
What a state you're in!

896
01:57:43,270 --> 01:57:45,038
What did the bastard do to you?

897
01:57:51,712 --> 01:57:53,981
Hurry, we'll miss the tram.

898
01:57:54,181 --> 01:57:56,149
I'm just having a glass of water.

899
01:58:01,555 --> 01:58:02,322
Don't be so nervous.

900
01:58:03,357 --> 01:58:04,758
It's only to replace someone.

901
01:58:39,860 --> 01:58:41,428
Good evening professor!

902
01:58:41,562 --> 01:58:44,364
I'm so looking forward
to your Schubert.

903
01:58:44,498 --> 01:58:49,536
I think I should go and take
my seat. It begins in 8 minutes.

904
01:58:49,636 --> 01:58:50,938
I'll come up with you.

905
01:58:51,371 --> 01:58:55,342
Good evening,
I'm delighted to see you here.

906
01:58:55,576 --> 01:58:59,179
What about our convalescent?
She doesn't lack courage.

907
01:58:59,313 --> 01:59:02,549
She insisted on coming tonight.
To hear you play.

908
01:59:03,183 --> 01:59:04,651
Good evening.

909
01:59:04,751 --> 01:59:06,687
How are you feeling?

910
01:59:06,753 --> 01:59:08,922
Sorry, let me introduce myself.

911
01:59:09,022 --> 01:59:11,425
I'm Mrs. Schober.
My daughter, Anna

912
01:59:12,826 --> 01:59:14,561
This is my mother.

913
01:59:14,661 --> 01:59:17,931
Lovely to meet you. You must be
very proud of your daughter.

914
01:59:18,332 --> 01:59:20,067
Why? It's a school concert.

915
01:59:21,401 --> 01:59:23,403
She's standing in for a pupil.

916
01:59:23,604 --> 01:59:25,005
That pupil is my daughter.

917
01:59:26,006 --> 01:59:27,407
Where are you sitting?

918
01:59:32,079 --> 01:59:33,847
Not far from us.

919
01:59:34,448 --> 01:59:37,851
It's late. We'd better go.
Can we go up together?

920
01:59:38,018 --> 01:59:39,086
Are you coming, Anna?

921
01:59:40,153 --> 01:59:43,991
See you later. I'll go up
with Mrs. Schober. Break a leg.

922
01:59:44,324 --> 01:59:45,859
Enjoy the concert.

923
01:59:46,093 --> 01:59:48,161
Goodbye,
it was a pleasure to see you.

924
02:01:08,375 --> 02:01:09,309
There, now...

925
02:01:10,377 --> 02:01:11,778
What a nice surprise!

926
02:01:13,280 --> 02:01:15,382
George! Look who's here.

927
02:01:15,382 --> 02:01:16,416
- Professor Kohut.
- My respects.

928
02:01:16,583 --> 02:01:20,020
Hurry up, Gerda.
Give me your coat.

929
02:01:20,087 --> 02:01:21,655
I'll keep it with me.

930
02:01:21,788 --> 02:01:24,024
Men! Always rushing you.
You know how it is.

931
02:01:24,157 --> 02:01:26,293
Have an excellent evening.

932
02:01:26,827 --> 02:01:28,128
Come on!

933
02:01:28,328 --> 02:01:29,730
See you later, I hope.

934
02:01:29,963 --> 02:01:32,799
My respects, Professor.
I can't wait to hear you play.
