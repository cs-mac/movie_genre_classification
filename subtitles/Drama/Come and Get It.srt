1
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,461
Hey, son!

2
00:02:12,531 --> 00:02:14,123
Let me show you
how to do that.

3
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:17,994
Come and get it!

4
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:21,301
Come and get it
or we'll throw it to the dogs!

5
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:38,388
Set up and get it!

6
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:42,084
What's the matter?
Ain't we cutting enough timber?

7
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:43,423
Not half enough.

8
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,659
- Hello, Romie, how are you?
- I'm fine.

9
00:02:46,732 --> 00:02:49,257
What's the matter,
aren't you getting enough?

10
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,826
- Once more on the beef!
- Coming up!

11
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:56,967
Wait a minute.
You ought to know better than that.

12
00:02:57,042 --> 00:03:00,808
You know the rules about drinking.
No wonder you're behind cutting timber.

13
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,279
Sit down!

14
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,838
I'll talk to you later.

15
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:04,905
Cookie!

16
00:03:05,684 --> 00:03:06,673
Get rid of this.

17
00:03:07,586 --> 00:03:09,554
- Eric.
- Hello, Barney.

18
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:11,522
- Where's Swan?
- Gone up to Camp Three.

19
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,581
- Back today, maybe.
- What is he doing there?

20
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:17,220
Camp Three is on schedule.
It's you fellows that are behind.

21
00:03:17,296 --> 00:03:18,354
I know that.

22
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:20,591
As soon as he comes back,
I wanna see him.

23
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:23,032
- Tea! More tea, son!
- Coming up! Coming up!

24
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,673
Hot! Hot!

25
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:32,074
Gee, mister, I'm sorry.

26
00:03:32,144 --> 00:03:34,704
- Honest, mister.
- You awkward little flunky!

27
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,179
I'll teach you to burn me!

28
00:03:36,248 --> 00:03:38,512
- I didn't mean it!
- Wait a minute!

29
00:03:38,584 --> 00:03:41,747
- He couldn’t help it.
- Let go or I'll give you a dose of it.

30
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,947
Don't get excited.
It was an accident.

31
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:45,012
Now, sit down.

32
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,025
Say, who do you think you are?
Come on, Max.

33
00:03:48,093 --> 00:03:51,654
Now, listen, boys.
Don't start anything you can’t finish.

34
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:53,593
You may be sorry.

35
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:14,377
- Barney!
- Swan!

36
00:04:14,453 --> 00:04:16,819
Why ain't you tell me
you was coming?

37
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:20,825
You old polecat, long time no see.
How you been, anyway?

38
00:04:21,493 --> 00:04:25,452
Just fine like frog's hair.
What you doing around here?

39
00:04:26,298 --> 00:04:29,233
That teach you not to have
monkey business with Barney Glasgow.

40
00:04:29,301 --> 00:04:32,759
He's tough fella. Pretty soon
you'll have camp of your own.

41
00:04:32,838 --> 00:04:34,601
One camp wouldn’t be enough.

42
00:04:34,673 --> 00:04:37,233
<i>Ja? You want to be my boss?</i>

43
00:04:37,309 --> 00:04:39,436
Watch out.
Maybe I am already.

44
00:04:39,511 --> 00:04:40,500
What's this?

45
00:04:42,648 --> 00:04:44,343
By George!

46
00:04:45,317 --> 00:04:48,343
Yumpin' yiminy!
Hey, fellas!

47
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,251
Fellas! What you think?

48
00:04:50,322 --> 00:04:52,847
Old Hewitt make Barney
big boss of whole line.

49
00:04:57,663 --> 00:04:59,927
Get off of me,
you crazy Swede!

50
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,832
By George, we celebrate.
Everybody get drunk.

51
00:05:02,901 --> 00:05:04,095
You bet we will.

52
00:05:05,037 --> 00:05:06,629
Wait a minute.

53
00:05:06,705 --> 00:05:11,165
We'll get drunk all right, but not
until we get all the logs down to the mills.

54
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,639
I know, I know!

55
00:05:13,712 --> 00:05:18,411
All right, fellas, settle down.
I'm gonna make a little speech.

56
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:21,183
You're falling way behind
in your cutting.

57
00:05:21,253 --> 00:05:22,880
You’re not only gonna catch up,

58
00:05:22,955 --> 00:05:25,355
but you’re gonna cut
sections nine and ten.

59
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,553
Those are orders!

60
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,824
We're gonna send every log
down to the mills on time!

61
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:35,191
Now, do you fellas want
all the free liquor you can drink?

62
00:05:35,267 --> 00:05:36,256
All right.

63
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:40,066
Then every one of you men have
gotta do a two-man job of chopping.

64
00:05:47,713 --> 00:05:49,408
Timber!

65
00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:57,086
Timber!

66
00:06:13,305 --> 00:06:15,671
What you fellas doing?
Playing?

67
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:18,835
Everybody got to do four men's work.
Come on, now.

68
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,037
There she goes!

69
00:06:24,316 --> 00:06:27,410
Timber!

70
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,633
Well, I get some news.

71
00:06:45,137 --> 00:06:47,435
- How does it look?
- Good.

72
00:06:47,506 --> 00:06:50,134
The river come up six inches.
Thermometer go up, too.

73
00:06:50,209 --> 00:06:52,234
That's the south wind.
Looks like the breakup.

74
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:54,609
<i>- Ja, we start drive tomorrow.
- Sure!</i>

75
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,705
If my figures are right,
we got 28 million

76
00:06:56,782 --> 00:06:59,410
and some odd thousand feet
cut, decked, and ready to go.

77
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:02,215
We won't leave ten cents' worth
of timber behind when we move out.

78
00:07:02,287 --> 00:07:05,256
By George, Barney, I ain't see
how you make the boys do it.

79
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:07,554
Old Hewitt should raise
your pay some more.

80
00:07:07,626 --> 00:07:09,787
<i>- He'll do better than that.
- Ja?</i>

81
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:11,752
A partnership.

82
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,594
I'm on my way up, Swan.

83
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:17,567
I got a good start,
and nothing is going to stop me.

84
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,205
In ten years, I'm gonna be
one of the richest men in this state.

85
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:23,672
You wait and see.

86
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:27,403
Hewitt likes me,
and there's no limit to where I'm going.

87
00:07:29,548 --> 00:07:31,743
They say his daughter
like you, too.

88
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:36,048
Do they?
Well, she's a fine girl.

89
00:07:36,855 --> 00:07:39,483
You marry her? Maybe?

90
00:07:39,558 --> 00:07:41,185
No maybe about it.

91
00:07:42,761 --> 00:07:45,127
- Yumpin' yiminy!
- Wait, you crazy Swede.

92
00:07:45,197 --> 00:07:47,825
Don't jump on me
or I'll kick you in the teeth!

93
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,232
By George,
that the only way you stop me.

94
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:52,236
Barney, why ain't you tell me?

95
00:07:53,338 --> 00:07:54,327
She pretty?

96
00:07:54,406 --> 00:07:57,705
She's got a good head
on her shoulders, I'll say that for her.

97
00:07:57,776 --> 00:07:59,073
She's...

98
00:08:00,312 --> 00:08:02,974
<i>- Listen. Do you hear that?
- Ja.</i>

99
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:06,746
- It's the ice breaking up.
- We have plenty of water tomorrow.

100
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,844
You bet we will.
You start on the lower pond,

101
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:11,515
and if the decks are frozen,
use dynamite to break them out.

102
00:08:30,542 --> 00:08:32,203
How's the ice under these decks?

103
00:08:32,277 --> 00:08:35,508
We're using a lot of dynamite,
but it's not breaking up very fast.

104
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:36,639
Keep on blowing it.

105
00:08:36,715 --> 00:08:40,412
Tell Swan to get that flume gate open,
and we'll have running water in no time.

106
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,908
All right.

107
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:21,889
- Keep those logs rolling in the flume.
- The boys are working hard.

108
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,484
They got to work twice as hard.

109
00:09:23,562 --> 00:09:25,723
I want a million feet
in the river every day.

110
00:09:25,797 --> 00:09:27,389
- Now hop on it.
- All right.

111
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:41,404
You pond monkeys!
Keep those sticks moving.

112
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:14,730
- Hello, Barney.
- Hello, Nils.

113
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,131
How you doing?

114
00:12:16,201 --> 00:12:17,930
- Hello, Mr. Hewitt.
- Hello, Barney.

115
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:19,493
- How are you?
- Hello, Swan.

116
00:12:19,571 --> 00:12:22,734
Hear that saw?
Sounds good, doesn't it? All your logs.

117
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:24,742
Every stick and 11 days
ahead of schedule.

118
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,540
You ought to have made it quicker
with all the high water.

119
00:12:27,612 --> 00:12:30,240
Mr. Hewitt, nobody
ever make such big drive.

120
00:12:30,315 --> 00:12:33,773
- And in such time? Not even you.
- Well, who said I did?

121
00:12:33,852 --> 00:12:35,547
It's all right.
Good work, Barney.

122
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,316
- You got a bonus coming.
- Yeah? I've earned it.

123
00:12:39,324 --> 00:12:41,918
- Say, Mr. Hewitt, I got an idea.
- You have?

124
00:12:41,993 --> 00:12:42,982
Yeah.

125
00:12:43,061 --> 00:12:47,225
Did you read where the Congress
may pass a law giving the railroads

126
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:50,063
every other section of land
along any right-of-way they build?

127
00:12:50,135 --> 00:12:52,262
What's that got to do with me?
I'm not in the railroad business.

128
00:12:52,337 --> 00:12:54,897
I know. But what's
to prevent us from shoo-flying

129
00:12:54,973 --> 00:12:58,272
a hundred miles of rail through
that government timber up north

130
00:12:58,343 --> 00:13:02,279
and grabbing all the pine
we'll ever need at $1,000 a mile?

131
00:13:02,347 --> 00:13:05,282
What good will it do
if I only get every other section?

132
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,285
How about putting Timber jacks
on the sections you don't own,

133
00:13:08,353 --> 00:13:11,652
pay them $25 a month and board,
and homestead it?

134
00:13:11,723 --> 00:13:14,749
After they've proven up,
have them deed it back to me.

135
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:17,719
- No?
- Back to us.

136
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:19,820
You got a nerve.

137
00:13:19,898 --> 00:13:22,731
It'll be the biggest deal ever pulled.
What do you say?

138
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:26,999
- That ain't honest, that's stealing.
- It's legal, all within the law.

139
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:28,471
Barney, that's stealing.

140
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,939
Who wouldn’t pick up
a million dollars

141
00:13:30,008 --> 00:13:31,839
laying at their feet yelling,
"Come and get it"?

142
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,208
- I know, but...
- What do you say, Mr. Hewitt?

143
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:35,576
Shall we tackle it?

144
00:13:35,647 --> 00:13:37,410
- We? Us?
- Yeah.

145
00:13:37,482 --> 00:13:40,815
- So you wanna be a partner?
- Could you find a better one?

146
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:44,447
Don't know if I could, Barney.
But I have to think of Emma Louise.

147
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:47,048
- That your daughter?
- Yeah.

148
00:13:47,692 --> 00:13:50,092
The business will
go to her someday...

149
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,858
that is, to her
and her husband, of course.

150
00:13:54,332 --> 00:13:56,163
You haven't been to see us lately.

151
00:13:57,068 --> 00:13:59,434
Well, I've been jumping
all over the state,

152
00:13:59,504 --> 00:14:02,371
but I had intended getting back
to Bewdamore this week.

153
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,908
Good, we'll expect you.
Have a cigar.

154
00:14:04,976 --> 00:14:05,965
Thanks.

155
00:14:06,711 --> 00:14:08,042
I got to run along.

156
00:14:08,113 --> 00:14:11,571
I promised the boys a jamboree,
and they're getting cleaned up for it.

157
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,642
- I'll see you next week.
- Fine. Bye, Barney.

158
00:14:14,719 --> 00:14:16,346
Thanks, Mr. Hewitt.

159
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,284
- Hello, boys!
- Hello, Sid!

160
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:24,590
Welcome to Iron Ridge.
I'm glad to see you back, and you, too.

161
00:14:24,663 --> 00:14:26,824
Come in,
can you take a little drink?

162
00:14:26,898 --> 00:14:28,297
Try me and see.

163
00:14:28,366 --> 00:14:31,529
- How are you, Swan?
- Fine. You’re getting fatter every day.

164
00:14:31,603 --> 00:14:33,400
Three square meals a day will do it.

165
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,837
- What do you want?
- Wait a minute, Barney.

166
00:14:35,907 --> 00:14:39,399
- The first drink is on the house.
- Fine. The next one is on me.

167
00:14:39,477 --> 00:14:41,536
- And the next on me.
- Not on your life.

168
00:14:41,613 --> 00:14:44,707
Here you are, Sid.
Don't let my boys pay for a thing.

169
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:46,876
And when this is gone,
let me know.

170
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:49,250
This is going to buy a lot of drinks.
Here you are, Charlie.

171
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,084
Whiskey with a beer chaser.

172
00:14:52,891 --> 00:14:56,258
Quiet, everybody, quiet.
Quiet down over there.

173
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:59,092
Free drinks for all the jacks.
Barney Glasgow's buying.

174
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:02,298
Thanks, Barney!

175
00:15:02,367 --> 00:15:04,801
Watch me closely,
it's the old army game.

176
00:15:04,869 --> 00:15:06,268
Where is the little pea?

177
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:07,805
- It's right here.
- Sorry.

178
00:15:07,872 --> 00:15:09,669
The house wins,
and the gambler loses.

179
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:11,470
- Hello, Earl.
- Hello, Barney.

180
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:14,410
- You feel lucky this trip?
- Sure. I'll bet $5.

181
00:15:14,479 --> 00:15:18,609
The object of this game is to find
the shell under which the pea is hidden.

182
00:15:18,683 --> 00:15:20,378
If you'll follow closely,
you may solve

183
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:22,386
one of the scientific problems
of the age...

184
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:24,285
whether the eye
is quicker than the hand

185
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,449
or whether the hand
is quicker than the eye.

186
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,628
- It's under that one.
- The gentleman wins.

187
00:15:31,696 --> 00:15:35,257
Now remember, a dozen
can bet on this game as well as one.

188
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:38,063
And remember this also,
that the sky is the limit.

189
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:41,265
- I can bet as much as I like?
- As much as you like.

190
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:43,899
You’re crazy,
that's the way you lose last trip.

191
00:15:44,976 --> 00:15:47,536
I'll bet... $500.

192
00:15:47,612 --> 00:15:48,840
$500!

193
00:15:48,913 --> 00:15:53,373
But, Barney, $500 is too much.
What if you lose?

194
00:15:53,451 --> 00:15:55,442
Don't worry,
I know what I'm doing.

195
00:15:56,421 --> 00:15:59,413
There you are.
Give me a little elbow room.

196
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:01,015
I can’t play...

197
00:16:02,827 --> 00:16:05,762
- Hello.
- Hello.

198
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,092
You gonna bring me luck?

199
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,460
If I do, it'll be the first time.

200
00:16:12,537 --> 00:16:14,835
Swan, make room for the lady.

201
00:16:17,742 --> 00:16:19,437
Five hundred’s right.
Are you ready?

202
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:21,877
No, no,
where's your five hundred?

203
00:16:21,946 --> 00:16:24,471
That's all right.
The house is good for it.

204
00:16:24,549 --> 00:16:25,846
Why don't you put it up?

205
00:16:25,917 --> 00:16:29,045
- Now listen...
- All right. I'll put it up for him.

206
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:33,355
- So you’re not lucky?
- Think I'd be here if I was?

207
00:16:33,992 --> 00:16:36,222
There you are, Mr. Glasgow.

208
00:16:36,294 --> 00:16:38,728
- Satisfied?
- Yeah. Go ahead and roll them.

209
00:16:38,797 --> 00:16:40,731
Watch closely,
it's the old army game.

210
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,960
I have nothing up my sleeves
to deceive you.

211
00:16:43,034 --> 00:16:45,935
I've had my turn, now it's yours.

212
00:16:47,305 --> 00:16:48,499
Where is it, Sid?

213
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,471
It's your bet.

214
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:52,908
Where do you think it is?

215
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:55,078
I didn't notice, did you?

216
00:16:57,315 --> 00:16:59,249
- It's under there.
- Is it?

217
00:16:59,317 --> 00:17:00,784
Pick it up and let's see.

218
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,448
You pick up the other two.

219
00:17:04,956 --> 00:17:05,945
You got him.

220
00:17:06,024 --> 00:17:09,187
Barney, that ain't the way
to play this game, and you know it.

221
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,386
It's the way I'm going to play it.

222
00:17:11,596 --> 00:17:14,690
- Turn over the other two.
- Keep your hands off.

223
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:25,534
You win.

224
00:17:28,913 --> 00:17:31,882
Here's a little souvenir
for you, Sid. Thank you.

225
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:34,876
- Are you coming with me?
- Sure.

226
00:17:40,658 --> 00:17:42,717
You don't need anybody
to bring you luck.

227
00:17:42,794 --> 00:17:45,763
No, but it looks like
I got more than my share.

228
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:46,819
Meaning me?

229
00:17:48,433 --> 00:17:49,422
Yeah.

230
00:17:51,302 --> 00:17:52,667
What's your name?

231
00:17:53,972 --> 00:17:57,430
- Morgan. Lotta Morgan.
- Hello, Lotta.

232
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:59,875
- My name is Barn...
- I know, you’re Barney Glasgow.

233
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:03,012
There's yours, Lotta.

234
00:18:04,315 --> 00:18:05,475
Thanks.

235
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,544
Come on, Lotta,
let's go to work.

236
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:13,491
Stay here,
I'll be with you in a minute.

237
00:18:17,295 --> 00:18:20,230
Hello, Sid.
Want me to get your money back?

238
00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:21,993
I'll give you a hundred if you do.

239
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:25,961
Hello, Lotta.

240
00:18:26,938 --> 00:18:29,839
- Feel like working, boys?
- Sure. Come on, Shorty.

241
00:18:32,677 --> 00:18:34,008
Make it 200.

242
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,509
Give me something
to put in his drink.

243
00:18:45,056 --> 00:18:51,359
As the blackbird in the spring

244
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:57,231
'Neath the willow tree

245
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:04,731
Sat and piped,
I heard him sing

246
00:19:04,809 --> 00:19:10,941
Singing Arra Lee

247
00:19:11,015 --> 00:19:15,145
Arra Lee

248
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:19,520
Arra Lee

249
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:27,293
Take my golden ring

250
00:19:27,365 --> 00:19:31,062
Love and light

251
00:19:31,135 --> 00:19:38,337
Return with thee

252
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:50,012
And swallows with the spring

253
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:04,667
Wait till his boys
drift out for supper.

254
00:20:18,316 --> 00:20:22,275
Barney! Barney!
Is it all right if I come along?

255
00:20:22,353 --> 00:20:24,116
Sure, come on!

256
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:28,758
This is my friend Swan Bostrom.
Miss Lotta Morgan.

257
00:20:28,826 --> 00:20:30,919
How are you? Quiet!

258
00:20:30,995 --> 00:20:32,394
Sing it again!

259
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:36,533
- Might as well get this over with.
- Quiet.

260
00:20:36,601 --> 00:20:40,401
- Keep quiet!
- Come on over here. Too far to walk.

261
00:20:43,107 --> 00:20:44,404
This one's for you.

262
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:51,280
When the mistletoe was green

263
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:52,839
- Hurry up, Shorty.
- I'm coming.

264
00:20:52,917 --> 00:20:58,287
'Midst the winter snows

265
00:20:58,356 --> 00:21:04,659
Sunshine on my face was seen

266
00:21:04,729 --> 00:21:12,534
Kissing lips of rose

267
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:16,506
Arra Lee

268
00:21:16,574 --> 00:21:18,804
Arra Lee...

269
00:21:18,876 --> 00:21:20,776
Wonder what she's doing
in a place like this?

270
00:21:20,845 --> 00:21:23,313
What's the matter with this place?

271
00:21:23,381 --> 00:21:28,375
Take my golden ring

272
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:32,253
Love and light

273
00:21:32,323 --> 00:21:39,092
Return with thee

274
00:21:40,331 --> 00:21:50,673
And swallows with the spring

275
00:21:59,617 --> 00:22:01,744
By golly, I have good time.

276
00:22:01,819 --> 00:22:05,277
You know, Lotta,
I like that song you sing, "Arra Lee."

277
00:22:05,356 --> 00:22:07,984
- How long have you been in this place?
- First time I hear...

278
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:09,993
- Two, three weeks.
- Where do you come from?

279
00:22:11,295 --> 00:22:12,990
- Milwaukee.
- First time I...

280
00:22:13,064 --> 00:22:15,225
- Are your folks still alive?
- Yeah.

281
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:17,961
- I feel so bad.
- Do you ever hear from them?

282
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:20,527
- Once in a while.
- I forget... where I am.

283
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:23,073
- How long since you left home?
- What?

284
00:22:23,307 --> 00:22:25,241
How long ago
did you leave home?

285
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:26,901
Say, you guys are all alike.

286
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:29,469
You buy a girl a drink,
you want to know the story of her life.

287
00:22:29,547 --> 00:22:32,812
Anyways, girl pick my pocket
for $20, by George!

288
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,213
- Barney! Barney!
- What?

289
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:40,723
We're going to eat.

290
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:43,090
- Well, go ahead.
- Aren't you coming?

291
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:44,355
Come on, Barney!

292
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:46,090
We come over later.

293
00:22:46,164 --> 00:22:48,530
Lief, take the boys,
get them something to eat.

294
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:50,931
Order plenty of chicken.
We'll be right over.

295
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:52,799
We'll wait for you.

296
00:22:54,672 --> 00:22:56,469
Now let's see, where were we?

297
00:22:56,541 --> 00:23:01,979
Yeah. Can you give me
any good reason why you can’t go home?

298
00:23:02,046 --> 00:23:03,877
- Are you going to start?
- Good idea.

299
00:23:03,948 --> 00:23:05,472
What are you, missionaries?

300
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,280
- I'm getting sick...
- Wait, keep quiet and listen.

301
00:23:08,352 --> 00:23:12,652
I'm not nosy, I'm on the level about this.
Why can’t you go home to your folks?

302
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:13,713
Because...

303
00:23:15,293 --> 00:23:18,353
If you must know, there are
165 reasons why I can’t go home.

304
00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:19,623
All of them are dollars.

305
00:23:19,697 --> 00:23:22,632
- Railroad fare?
- Ain't that enough?

306
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,931
- You think money grows on trees?
- Mine did.

307
00:23:26,003 --> 00:23:28,494
Here's enough
for your railroad fare

308
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:31,872
and some to tide you over
until you get yourself a decent job.

309
00:23:31,943 --> 00:23:33,240
I got few dollars, too.

310
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:36,780
What's the catch?

311
00:23:36,848 --> 00:23:39,316
- No catch. I like you.
- I like you too, Lotta.

312
00:23:39,383 --> 00:23:41,408
You don't belong here, that's all.

313
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:44,080
Go on, take it.
It's all velvet.

314
00:23:46,924 --> 00:23:52,487
You may look all right to the naked eye,
but you’d better stop drinking.

315
00:23:53,164 --> 00:23:55,291
You better take care
of his money for him.

316
00:23:55,366 --> 00:23:57,891
- Too proud to take it?
- Will you get out of here?

317
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:00,660
- Why?
- Because...

318
00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:07,901
Your pocket’s full of money.
Sid LeMaire's sitting over there.

319
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:09,947
If you think he's gonna
let you get away, you’re crazy.

320
00:24:10,014 --> 00:24:11,641
Don't worry about Sid LeMaire.

321
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:16,346
Go on, Barney.
Please, do what I tell you.

322
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,409
Will you go with us?

323
00:24:18,489 --> 00:24:20,354
- What?
- I mean it.

324
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,756
No, I'll stay
right here where I belong.

325
00:24:26,831 --> 00:24:28,799
- Then I stay, too.
- Me, too.

326
00:24:28,866 --> 00:24:29,924
<i>- Skol.
- Skoll</i>

327
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:34,060
Why you do that?

328
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,768
Will you get out of here?

329
00:24:36,841 --> 00:24:37,830
Sure.

330
00:24:40,311 --> 00:24:41,676
You’re getting out with us.
Come on!

331
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:43,646
- Listen, I...
- Look out, Barney!

332
00:24:44,715 --> 00:24:46,012
All right. Go get’em.

333
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:48,582
Get’em coming up
the other end.

334
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,348
Duck under the table.

335
00:24:50,421 --> 00:24:53,083
- What do you think I am?
- I think you’re all right.

336
00:25:10,274 --> 00:25:12,708
- Thank you.
- Don't be so polite.

337
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:15,342
I won't.

338
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:23,413
Stay down, stay down!

339
00:25:27,725 --> 00:25:31,821
- Here, try these.
- Swan, you found a gold mine.

340
00:25:33,497 --> 00:25:34,486
Let him have it!

341
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:39,696
Come on,
what are you afraid of?

342
00:25:40,304 --> 00:25:43,865
How you like that one, Sid?
Wait, I got another one for you.

343
00:25:51,315 --> 00:25:52,612
Let's both do it.

344
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,388
Barney, there's one you missed.

345
00:26:08,332 --> 00:26:10,994
Timber!

346
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:23,213
- Who is it?
- A lumberjack friend of yours.

347
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:24,339
Come on in, Barney.

348
00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:26,538
Did you miss me?

349
00:26:27,818 --> 00:26:30,048
Miss you? You been away?

350
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:37,054
I've been away for two hours,
and it seems like two months.

351
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:47,670
I love you, Barney.
Any objections?

352
00:26:47,738 --> 00:26:49,729
I'd object like the devil
if you didn't.

353
00:26:51,842 --> 00:26:54,868
To prove that I do know
something about women's clothes,

354
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:55,935
look what I got you.

355
00:26:56,013 --> 00:26:58,072
Is that what all those
measurements were for?

356
00:27:21,505 --> 00:27:26,204
Say, did you ever try wearing your hair
without those thingamajigs?

357
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:27,301
In public?

358
00:27:28,412 --> 00:27:30,209
Let's see,
which is the front?

359
00:27:30,281 --> 00:27:31,475
Let me see.

360
00:27:32,516 --> 00:27:33,881
Barney, it's elegant.

361
00:27:33,951 --> 00:27:36,647
It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

362
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:38,882
It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

363
00:27:40,424 --> 00:27:43,757
When the mistletoe was green

364
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:47,059
'Midst the winter snow

365
00:27:51,335 --> 00:27:52,859
Come on in, Swan.

366
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:58,605
Come on, get down.

367
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:00,871
Why ain't you come for supper?
I wait half-hour.

368
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:02,242
We're coming right away.

369
00:28:02,313 --> 00:28:04,304
Wait, I've got a new dress.
I've got to put it on.

370
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:06,942
<i>Ja, I wait two half-hours now?</i>

371
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:10,186
You didn't waste your time
while waiting, did you?

372
00:28:10,254 --> 00:28:13,018
Barney, I forget.
A telegram just come for you.

373
00:28:35,846 --> 00:28:38,508
Aura Lee

374
00:28:38,582 --> 00:28:41,915
Aura Lee

375
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:47,549
Take my golden ring

376
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:55,225
Love and light returns with thee

377
00:28:55,299 --> 00:29:04,071
And swallows in the spring

378
00:29:11,882 --> 00:29:15,249
- This steam feels good.
- There's nothing like it.

379
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:18,186
- We have good fun for four days.
- Just like old times.

380
00:29:18,255 --> 00:29:21,247
<i>Ja! Better!
We ain't got Lotta in old times.</i>

381
00:29:21,325 --> 00:29:24,192
Yeah, it's funny how that kid
gets under your skin.

382
00:29:24,261 --> 00:29:28,288
<i>Ja, just like sun when she come up
over big pines on snow.</i>

383
00:29:28,365 --> 00:29:29,559
Oscar, cool him off.

384
00:29:29,633 --> 00:29:30,622
You know, Barney...

385
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,404
The sun comes up
over the pines!

386
00:29:38,909 --> 00:29:42,003
That's all right, Barney.
Lotta's fine girl.

387
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:45,139
- They don't make them any better.
- She plumb crazy for you, too.

388
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:47,810
- No!
- Yeah, you crazy for her.

389
00:29:47,885 --> 00:29:49,978
I know that when I see you
look at each other.

390
00:29:50,054 --> 00:29:53,182
- Oscar, give him another one.
- No, Osc... No, no!

391
00:29:57,161 --> 00:29:58,150
Why you do that?

392
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:01,328
The heat's gone to your head.

393
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:05,227
No, Barney.
I see what my eyes see.

394
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:07,736
What you do
about that other girl?

395
00:30:08,639 --> 00:30:10,903
What? What other girl?

396
00:30:11,575 --> 00:30:14,066
That girl you was going to marry,
the old man's daughter.

397
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:18,477
I'm still going to marry her, Swan.

398
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:21,416
Well, what about Lotta?

399
00:30:23,754 --> 00:30:25,051
Well, I...

400
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:30,791
<i>- Oscar, help me get out of here.
- Ja, Barney, I come right away.</i>

401
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:38,458
You don't understand, Swan.

402
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:41,733
I've got to do it.
It means being Hewitt's partner.

403
00:30:41,805 --> 00:30:44,035
That's what I've been working
all my life for.

404
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:48,475
Well, why don't you say something?

405
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:51,709
I ain't say nothing.
You know already what I got to say.

406
00:30:51,782 --> 00:30:53,875
Sure, maybe you’re right.

407
00:30:53,951 --> 00:30:57,944
Lotta is...
I didn't think it was going this far.

408
00:30:59,323 --> 00:31:02,190
- You break her heart, Barney.
- She'll get over it.

409
00:31:03,294 --> 00:31:04,283
Tell her...

410
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:10,760
Tell her if she ever
needs anything, to let me know.

411
00:31:10,834 --> 00:31:12,392
She can have anything she wants.

412
00:31:12,469 --> 00:31:13,800
You think she'd take it?

413
00:31:16,273 --> 00:31:18,901
What you say... me tell her?

414
00:31:18,976 --> 00:31:21,171
Ain't you going
to see her before you go?

415
00:31:21,245 --> 00:31:22,542
I haven't got time.

416
00:31:24,448 --> 00:31:27,849
No, that isn't it.
I couldn't see her, Swan.

417
00:31:27,918 --> 00:31:32,184
If I did, I might not go.
You gotta tell her for me.

418
00:31:32,256 --> 00:31:33,518
What I going to say?

419
00:31:35,993 --> 00:31:38,723
- Tell her the truth.
- But, Barney, I can’t...

420
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:43,790
- I'm sorry, Swan. So long.
- Good-bye, Barney.

421
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:53,268
Barney?

422
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:56,142
- No, it's me.
- Just a minute.

423
00:32:01,118 --> 00:32:02,380
- Hello, Swan.
- Hey, Lotta.

424
00:32:03,787 --> 00:32:05,152
- Well?
- Lotta...

425
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:09,691
- Well, do you like it?
- What? I like what?

426
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,490
Holy smokes, and it took me
two hours to do it.

427
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:14,292
- To do what?
- My hair, stupid.

428
00:32:14,365 --> 00:32:18,165
<i>- I fixed it without the thingamajigs.
- Ja, I like that. Look nice.</i>

429
00:32:18,235 --> 00:32:20,703
<i>- You think Barney will like it?
- Ja, I think...</i>

430
00:32:20,771 --> 00:32:24,332
- Lotta, I got to tell you something.
- What?

431
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:31,038
Lotta... Lotta,
I ain't feel good.

432
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,948
- What's the matter, Swan?
- I got to tell you...

433
00:32:35,619 --> 00:32:40,056
<i>- That's too bad. You want a drink?
- Ja, you bet you I want drink.</i>

434
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,955
- You probably need it.
- You drink, too?

435
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:43,391
I'll have one with you.

436
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:50,393
<i>- Feel any better?
- Ja, a little bit.</i>

437
00:32:50,467 --> 00:32:52,162
Swell.
Where'd you leave Barney?

438
00:32:53,103 --> 00:32:56,595
I leave... I leave Barney
down the street. I think I have another.

439
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,641
- What were you gonna tell me?
- I was gonna tell you...

440
00:33:00,711 --> 00:33:03,942
I was gonna
tell you about... about Barney.

441
00:33:05,749 --> 00:33:09,685
You know, Barney's...
Barney's funny fella. He ain't say much.

442
00:33:09,753 --> 00:33:11,220
I know that.

443
00:33:11,288 --> 00:33:14,985
He ain't like other fellas.
Someday he's going to be big man.

444
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:17,493
- That all he think about.
- He's different.

445
00:33:17,561 --> 00:33:19,461
I knew that the minute I met him.

446
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:20,997
Like getting a bang on the nose.

447
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:22,965
For a while,
I didn't know what happened.

448
00:33:23,033 --> 00:33:26,127
- What happened?
- Plenty.

449
00:33:26,203 --> 00:33:30,071
You... You love him, Lotta?

450
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:35,236
- Well, what do you think?
- I think... I think...

451
00:33:36,847 --> 00:33:38,280
I think I have another drink.

452
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:42,351
You better leave
some for Barney.

453
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:44,580
I ain't have to,
he ain't comin' back.

454
00:33:47,024 --> 00:33:48,013
What did you say?

455
00:33:49,226 --> 00:33:52,957
That what I tried so hard to tell you.
And it just slip out.

456
00:33:57,434 --> 00:34:00,995
I didn't hear you, Swan.
What did you say?

457
00:34:01,071 --> 00:34:06,566
Lotta... Barney...
He ain't coming back.

458
00:34:08,145 --> 00:34:11,774
- I don't believe you. You’re lying.
- No, I ain't lie.

459
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:14,215
He gone on train already.

460
00:34:14,284 --> 00:34:18,653
He say to tell you he going to marry
old Hewitt's daughter.

461
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:31,257
I might have known.

462
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:33,098
That's what you get
for getting soft.

463
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:39,509
I might have seen it coming.

464
00:34:39,576 --> 00:34:43,068
Oh, no, I gotta get kicked
in the face before I get the idea.

465
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:50,542
Barney Glasgow.
Sure, he's different.

466
00:34:56,059 --> 00:34:59,722
Men are swell, ain't they?
They don't care if they...

467
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:28,013
We go again.

468
00:35:34,398 --> 00:35:36,992
Swan, Swan,
here's Pastor Carlson.

469
00:35:37,067 --> 00:35:39,433
<i>- God dag. Pastor.
- God dag. Bostrom.</i>

470
00:35:40,904 --> 00:35:42,838
<i>- You know all this people.
- Ja.</i>

471
00:35:42,906 --> 00:35:43,998
<i>- God dag.
- God dag.</i>

472
00:35:44,074 --> 00:35:45,439
I go get Lotta.

473
00:35:52,249 --> 00:35:55,776
Come, Lotta. Everything ready.
Minister just come.

474
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,885
Swan, you’re a fool to marry me.

475
00:36:09,766 --> 00:36:13,429
- Why do you want to do it?
- Because I love you.

476
00:36:16,106 --> 00:36:19,701
I'll never make as good a wife
as you deserve.

477
00:36:19,776 --> 00:36:23,906
Lotta. I hope I deserve you.

478
00:36:31,755 --> 00:36:33,814
You’re the kindest man
I ever knew.

479
00:36:41,098 --> 00:36:45,694
<i>- Are you ready?
- Ja, you bet I ready.</i>

480
00:36:45,769 --> 00:36:46,963
Come on.

481
00:37:14,698 --> 00:37:17,223
- Good morning, Mother.
- Good morning, Richard.

482
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:22,999
Gussie, go upstairs and tell
Mr. Glasgow his breakfast is cold.

483
00:37:23,073 --> 00:37:25,735
- I'll keep it hot for him.
- Do as I tell you.

484
00:37:25,809 --> 00:37:26,798
Yes, ma'am.

485
00:37:27,477 --> 00:37:30,378
You've been sending him
that message for ninety-odd years.

486
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:34,043
- Never hurried him yet, has it?
- It may have.

487
00:37:34,851 --> 00:37:39,345
Be careful how you muss up that paper.
It upsets your father to find it not fresh.

488
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:42,654
I've told you, you might
just as well use his toothbrush.

489
00:37:42,726 --> 00:37:44,250
I don't see the connection.

490
00:37:45,929 --> 00:37:49,797
The richest man in Wisconsin
could afford two morning papers.

491
00:37:49,866 --> 00:37:51,527
That would be extravagance.

492
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,594
The reason Mr. Glasgow
is the richest man in Wisconsin

493
00:37:54,671 --> 00:37:58,630
is because he and my father before him
knew how to take care of their money.

494
00:37:58,709 --> 00:38:02,008
Mother, why do you always
call father "Mr. Glasgow"?

495
00:38:02,846 --> 00:38:04,143
I don't see why not.

496
00:38:04,214 --> 00:38:06,148
My mother never called my father

497
00:38:06,216 --> 00:38:08,741
anything but "Mr. Hewitt"
to his dying day.

498
00:38:10,153 --> 00:38:13,384
- Never?
- Never.

499
00:38:22,866 --> 00:38:25,096
- Good morning, Miss Evvie.
- Good morning, Thomas.

500
00:38:25,168 --> 00:38:27,830
- Is Father in there?
- He's just finishing dressing.

501
00:38:27,904 --> 00:38:31,032
Pack a couple of bags for him.
Something for fishing.

502
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:33,076
- You know what to put in.
- Yes, miss.

503
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,242
Thomas,
what did you do with...

504
00:38:37,314 --> 00:38:39,782
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Evvie.

505
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:42,785
- And how are you this morning?
- So-so.

506
00:38:43,453 --> 00:38:46,183
Aren't you getting old enough
to have breakfast in bed?

507
00:38:46,256 --> 00:38:50,056
None of your gruff, Barney.
I like my breakfast hot, just like you do.

508
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:53,028
Is that so? You better not let
your mother hear you call me Barney.

509
00:38:53,096 --> 00:38:56,065
- What have you got there?
- A letter from Swan.

510
00:38:59,302 --> 00:39:02,271
- Go ahead and read it.
- I think I know what he's going to say.

511
00:39:02,806 --> 00:39:05,639
"Dear Barney,
hunting season just open.

512
00:39:05,709 --> 00:39:09,406
"Why ain't you come up
and we shoot deer just like old times?

513
00:39:09,479 --> 00:39:11,879
"I hope you
and family are feel good.

514
00:39:11,948 --> 00:39:16,749
"I feel so good myself, I think I beat you
choppin' down tree if you was here.

515
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:21,018
Just like I always do, by George!
Ha ha!" Is that true?

516
00:39:21,091 --> 00:39:23,252
I never liked to hurt his feelings.

517
00:39:23,326 --> 00:39:24,816
Nice of you.

518
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:26,453
"Anyways, l...

519
00:39:29,566 --> 00:39:33,024
"Anyway, I wish you come see me.

520
00:39:33,103 --> 00:39:36,470
"You and Lotta was two people
I like most in whole world...

521
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:41,438
and I lonesome to see you.
Your friend, Swan Bostrom."

522
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:53,489
You haven't seen Swan since he was
down here on business that time.

523
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:56,082
You and Mother were away
when his wife died.

524
00:39:56,159 --> 00:40:00,425
It's been over 20 years since you've
been up in Iron Ridge. Why, Barney?

525
00:40:02,466 --> 00:40:04,764
- You see, Evvie...
- Why don't you go?

526
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:08,271
You could shoot a bear there
instead of acting like one here.

527
00:40:11,241 --> 00:40:12,401
Am I doing that?

528
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:14,068
You need a change, darling.

529
00:40:14,911 --> 00:40:17,539
When you got back,
your mind would be in better shape,

530
00:40:17,614 --> 00:40:19,411
and so would your figure.

531
00:40:22,919 --> 00:40:24,819
- All right, I'll go.
- Good.

532
00:40:24,888 --> 00:40:27,448
You better behave
or I'll get in dutch.

533
00:40:27,524 --> 00:40:31,483
I will. Thomas! Thomas!
I feel better already.

534
00:40:31,561 --> 00:40:34,724
- Yes, Mr. Glasgow.
- Thomas, pack a few things for me.

535
00:40:34,798 --> 00:40:36,925
- Something I can use to...
- Go fishing?

536
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:42,896
Yes. Come on, scat,
get out of here, go on.

537
00:40:43,573 --> 00:40:45,564
You didn't say anything
about my new suit.

538
00:40:45,642 --> 00:40:48,338
I like it. Hides the fact
that you like to eat.

539
00:40:48,411 --> 00:40:50,072
Stop picking on me.

540
00:40:50,147 --> 00:40:52,172
Mother will say it looks
like one of your old ones.

541
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:54,774
- Bet you $2 she doesn't.
- I'll take it.

542
00:40:54,851 --> 00:40:56,216
You’re on.

543
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,111
- Good morning.
- Morning.

544
00:40:59,189 --> 00:41:01,248
- Good morning, Bernard.
- Nice day, isn't it?

545
00:41:03,059 --> 00:41:06,756
- Your breakfast is...
- I know, ruined.

546
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:08,991
- How are you, son?
- Fine, thank you.

547
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,633
- Any chicken livers, Gussie?
- Missus didn't tell me.

548
00:41:12,702 --> 00:41:15,967
I don't think there's any,
and the chicken’s for the party tonight.

549
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:17,836
Never mind, don't worry about it.

550
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:20,308
You seem
in a very cheerful mood, Bernard.

551
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:25,508
- World you like to see the paper?
- No, not now. Anything interesting?

552
00:41:25,582 --> 00:41:29,575
- Teddy's swinging the big stick again.
- What? Let me look at that.

553
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:36,891
This Roosevelt!

554
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,258
It's a wonder he wouldn’t
attend to running the government

555
00:41:39,329 --> 00:41:41,320
instead of sticking his nose
in other people's affairs.

556
00:41:41,398 --> 00:41:43,696
Something has to be done
with the country.

557
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:46,395
What do you expect
with radicals in Washington?

558
00:41:46,469 --> 00:41:49,927
Won't be long before they'll be passing
a law taxing us on the money we earn.

559
00:41:50,006 --> 00:41:51,166
Hear, hear!

560
00:41:51,241 --> 00:41:54,369
If you know more than Roosevelt,
why don't you run it?

561
00:41:54,444 --> 00:41:55,672
That's not the point.

562
00:41:55,745 --> 00:41:59,647
Now they've got some newfangled idea
about forestry conservation.

563
00:41:59,716 --> 00:42:02,708
Save the forest from the vandals.
Vandals, vandals!

564
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:05,084
- Do they mean you, Father?
- Of course!

565
00:42:05,155 --> 00:42:07,589
What in blazes
do they know about it?

566
00:42:07,657 --> 00:42:09,557
Taxes eating us
out of house and home

567
00:42:09,626 --> 00:42:12,561
on cut-over land that wouldn’t
grow a tree in a hundred years.

568
00:42:12,629 --> 00:42:14,654
It would if you’d
replant it after you cut it.

569
00:42:14,731 --> 00:42:16,722
Keep your mouth shut,
young man.

570
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,166
I heard all about that
replanting speech you made

571
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:21,170
to the Young Businessman’s Club.

572
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:23,706
- What?
- That one of your new suits?

573
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:28,775
- Yeah. Like it?
- Looks like one of the old ones.

574
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:32,441
Chapman's having a sale
of down comforters.

575
00:42:32,949 --> 00:42:37,784
I've a good mind to go to Milwaukee
this week, if it weren't for all the parties.

576
00:42:39,956 --> 00:42:44,552
I think you'll have to count me out.
I've got to go to Iron Ridge.

577
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:49,088
- Iron Ridge? What for?
- On business. I had a letter from Swan.

578
00:42:49,165 --> 00:42:52,931
But you can’t. Tonight's Evvie's
party for Orville and family.

579
00:42:53,003 --> 00:42:56,769
The first since they've been engaged.
What will his family think?

580
00:42:57,307 --> 00:43:00,140
Well, frankly,
I don't give a hoot what they think.

581
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:03,441
I've seen all I could stand
of Mr. Orville Bremmer and family.

582
00:43:03,513 --> 00:43:05,344
That goes for me, too.

583
00:43:05,415 --> 00:43:09,875
Personally, I think he's a stuffed shirt.
Sorry, Evvie. I'm going to the office.

584
00:43:09,953 --> 00:43:12,649
- Did you hear what he said?
- Maybe he's right.

585
00:43:12,722 --> 00:43:14,485
Well, that's a nice way to talk.

586
00:43:14,557 --> 00:43:17,958
If I felt that way I wouldn’t
get engaged, much less married.

587
00:43:18,028 --> 00:43:19,461
That's an idea.

588
00:43:19,529 --> 00:43:20,723
Now look here, Evvie.

589
00:43:20,797 --> 00:43:23,061
You don't have to marry
that fat can of lard

590
00:43:23,133 --> 00:43:25,067
or anybody else if you don't want to.

591
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:26,966
Fact is, I'd rather you didn't.

592
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:29,870
I don't care how old his family is
or how much money they've got.

593
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,431
Orville's all right. He's a good kid.

594
00:43:32,509 --> 00:43:35,808
Well, are you going to marry
Orville Bremmer or are you not?

595
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:37,346
Yes.

596
00:43:38,715 --> 00:43:40,580
Well, thank you very much.

597
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:42,811
I suppose it's very amusing to...

598
00:43:46,022 --> 00:43:48,752
That clock is three minutes slow.

599
00:43:48,825 --> 00:43:51,350
I hope you change your mind
about going north.

600
00:43:51,428 --> 00:43:55,626
I suppose I ought to know by now I can
never expect any help from my family.

601
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:57,860
The Reverend Taylor
said to me yesterday...

602
00:43:57,934 --> 00:43:59,959
he took one look
at my face and he said,

603
00:44:00,036 --> 00:44:04,769
"Mrs. Glasgow, if I ever I saw a woman
who's a martyr to her family,

604
00:44:04,841 --> 00:44:06,433
that woman is you."

605
00:44:07,377 --> 00:44:10,107
I've got to get to the office
before I go north.

606
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,909
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

607
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,745
- I'll go to the door with you.
- Come on.

608
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:24,751
- Morning, Mr. Glasgow.
- Morning.

609
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:28,963
I've been tripping
over that for years.

610
00:44:29,032 --> 00:44:30,659
It's a wonder somebody
wouldn’t take it out.

611
00:44:30,734 --> 00:44:32,861
- Morning, Mr. Glasgow.
- Morning, Josie.

612
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:35,837
Has the report on that
new bleaching process come in?

613
00:44:35,905 --> 00:44:36,894
The what?

614
00:44:36,973 --> 00:44:38,099
The bleaching proce...

615
00:44:39,776 --> 00:44:42,643
The report on the new
bleaching process. Did it come in?

616
00:44:42,712 --> 00:44:45,146
- We're expecting it tomorrow.
- It should have been here today.

617
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:46,739
- Find out why it isn't here.
- Yes, sir.

618
00:44:46,816 --> 00:44:47,840
And, Josie...

619
00:44:47,917 --> 00:44:51,250
Make a reservation on the 5:00 train.
Be sure it's a drawing room.

620
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:53,380
- I'm going to Iron Ridge.
- Thank heaven.

621
00:44:53,456 --> 00:44:54,946
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

622
00:45:04,968 --> 00:45:06,060
What do you want?

623
00:45:07,737 --> 00:45:10,865
If I can hang on to it,
I think I've got something here.

624
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:13,340
Tony Schwerke and I
have been experimenting.

625
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:16,538
- Well, what is it?
- A paper drinking cup.

626
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:19,707
- A what?
- A paper cup. To use in public places.

627
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:22,946
You drink out of it
and throw it away. It's sanitary.

628
00:45:23,019 --> 00:45:24,077
Sanitary, my eye!

629
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:27,385
People have been drinking
out of glasses for a thousand years.

630
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:31,888
- A thousand years is a long time, but...
- Don't waste my time.

631
00:45:31,961 --> 00:45:33,826
- Father...
- You heard what I said.

632
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:39,630
Yes, sir.

633
00:46:03,893 --> 00:46:06,225
Hope you enjoyed your trip,
Mr. Glasgow.

634
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:07,854
- There's a cigar.
- Thank you.

635
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:09,626
- Have a nice vacation.
- I will.

636
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:21,535
Come in.

637
00:46:22,612 --> 00:46:23,977
Come in!

638
00:46:28,084 --> 00:46:30,712
What's the matter,
don't you know me?

639
00:46:30,787 --> 00:46:32,550
Barney! Yumpin' yiminy!

640
00:46:32,622 --> 00:46:33,611
Go ahead, jump!

641
00:46:34,924 --> 00:46:36,892
I guess I getting too old to jump.

642
00:46:38,394 --> 00:46:41,693
- I'm glad to see you.
- I'm glad to see you!

643
00:46:41,764 --> 00:46:42,822
How you been?

644
00:46:44,067 --> 00:46:48,003
- You look just like always.
- I feel all right.

645
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:52,030
- You get my letter?
- Sure, that's why I'm here.

646
00:46:52,108 --> 00:46:55,805
We'll do some shooting,
like the old days.

647
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:02,542
- I got bad news.
- What's the matter?

648
00:47:03,686 --> 00:47:06,655
- The camp burn down two nights ago.
- How did that happen?

649
00:47:06,723 --> 00:47:10,056
That fool Cookie, he start fire,
then sashay out to get deer.

650
00:47:10,126 --> 00:47:13,562
When he get back,
camp is big blaze, but he put it out.

651
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:16,758
- Where am I going to stay?
- Stay right here with me.

652
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:19,563
Doggone it,
I wanted to do some shooting.

653
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:23,568
All right,
I'll go back on number 11 tonight.

654
00:47:25,341 --> 00:47:28,139
You stay here,
you get deer just the same.

655
00:47:28,211 --> 00:47:31,840
You can’t do that.
It's too far to go, morning and night.

656
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:37,708
Maybe you ain't get back here
in another ten years.

657
00:47:37,787 --> 00:47:39,084
Sure I will.

658
00:47:41,457 --> 00:47:43,322
I'm coming back soon.

659
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:45,623
Swan, this is a nice place
you got here.

660
00:47:45,695 --> 00:47:50,792
Comfortable, cozy, and...
Say, what is this?

661
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:53,529
Ain't you remember
that night at Alcazar?

662
00:47:53,603 --> 00:47:55,901
When we do such good job
on them hoodlums?

663
00:47:55,972 --> 00:47:57,872
<i>- This is one of the trays?
- Ja.</i>

664
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:05,176
By golly, we have fun that night.
You and me and Lotta.

665
00:48:12,455 --> 00:48:15,015
Lotta... she put that there.

666
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:21,323
She talk many times
about that night... before she die.

667
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:27,694
She talk many times
about you, too, Barney.

668
00:48:38,381 --> 00:48:43,683
She always say, "Someday,
Barney come back and see us."

669
00:48:43,753 --> 00:48:46,813
But you... you never come.

670
00:48:47,757 --> 00:48:49,657
Well, you know how it is, Swan.

671
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:52,217
<i>Ja, I guess you pretty busy fellow.</i>

672
00:48:52,295 --> 00:48:55,355
<i>- And have you been happy?
- Ja, you bet I happy.</i>

673
00:48:55,431 --> 00:48:59,094
Lotta make fine wife.
She learn to cook just like Swede.

674
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:04,434
- And you, Barney?
- Well, I got what I started for.

675
00:49:06,442 --> 00:49:10,606
- You happy?
- Happy? I suppose so.

676
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:13,411
- How's family?
- They're fine.

677
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:15,110
I wish you could see my daughter.

678
00:49:15,184 --> 00:49:18,176
I don't know what I'd do without her.
She's a great girl.

679
00:49:18,254 --> 00:49:20,051
I bet, with father like you.

680
00:49:21,524 --> 00:49:25,517
- I got fine daughter, too.
- Why not, with a father like you?

681
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:30,162
- Where is she?
- She work over at hotel.

682
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:32,861
I forget to ask you,
you have breakfast yet?

683
00:49:32,935 --> 00:49:33,959
No, not yet.

684
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:36,005
We go see her
and have breakfast, too.

685
00:49:36,072 --> 00:49:37,630
- All right.
- I get my shoes.

686
00:49:43,513 --> 00:49:47,074
Smell good.
Karie get us good breakfast.

687
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,983
- Karie? Who's Karie?
- That my sister's girl.

688
00:49:50,053 --> 00:49:52,385
She live with me.
She head waitress here.

689
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:58,253
That her.
Karie! Karie!

690
00:49:59,929 --> 00:50:01,362
All right, Swan.

691
00:50:03,466 --> 00:50:06,401
What you think?
Barney Glasgow come up to see us.

692
00:50:06,469 --> 00:50:10,303
Ain't that nice, Mr. Glasgow?
I'm sure glad to meet you.

693
00:50:10,373 --> 00:50:11,533
Glad to see you, too.

694
00:50:11,607 --> 00:50:13,734
Uncle Swan's told us
so many things about you.

695
00:50:13,810 --> 00:50:16,904
Every time I make Artsoppa,
he says how you used to like it.

696
00:50:16,979 --> 00:50:19,277
Artsoppa?
I haven't had any in years!

697
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:23,547
- I fix you some for tonight for dinner.
- No, I'm going back on number 11.

698
00:50:23,619 --> 00:50:24,984
I wish you ain't go.

699
00:50:25,054 --> 00:50:27,352
For your breakfast,
what would you like?

700
00:50:27,423 --> 00:50:29,892
- Fruit and coffee...
- And some oatmeal.

701
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:32,986
Some oatmeal. And we have
some very fine pork sausages.

702
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:35,725
- Got chicken livers?
- We've got chicken livers.

703
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:38,495
I put the order in myself
and I see that you get enough.

704
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:42,530
- She's a nice girl.
- You bet you she is.

705
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,498
Where's your daughter?

706
00:50:47,578 --> 00:50:48,670
That her.

707
00:50:50,013 --> 00:50:51,207
Take care of that table.

708
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:59,488
- Hello, Pa.
- This my daughter Lotta.

709
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:02,484
<i>- Lotta?
- Ja, her name Lotta, too.</i>

710
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:03,753
This Barney Glasgow.

711
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:05,317
How do you do, Mr. Glasgow?

712
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:09,788
How do you do?

713
00:51:11,969 --> 00:51:14,733
Why you stand up, Barney?
Sit down, sit down.

714
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:16,773
- Ain't he just like what I say?
- Yes.

715
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,899
Father's told me so much about you.

716
00:51:18,976 --> 00:51:20,443
Here we are, Mr. Glasgow.

717
00:51:20,511 --> 00:51:24,003
Here's your fruit.
Lotta, get the coffee and the toast.

718
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,780
We're glad to have you here.

719
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:30,444
And your chicken liver
will be ready in just a moment.

720
00:51:31,622 --> 00:51:37,652
- She pretty, Barney, just like her ma.
- For a moment, I thought it was.

721
00:51:37,728 --> 00:51:42,131
She's smart, too. She go to school
three night a week, study hard.

722
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:44,565
She say, "I ain't going to
work here always.

723
00:51:44,635 --> 00:51:46,068
Someday I get better job."

724
00:51:47,004 --> 00:51:48,904
That's fine, Swan, that's fine.

725
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:55,307
- So you don't like it here?
- Heavens, no.

726
00:51:55,379 --> 00:51:57,472
I want to go to Milwaukee
and learn something.

727
00:51:57,548 --> 00:52:00,210
I don't want to be stuck here
like Pa and Karie.

728
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:03,515
We hear that all the time.
Did you enjoy your breakfast?

729
00:52:03,587 --> 00:52:04,952
Yes, thanks, very much.

730
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:07,884
That smells nice.

731
00:52:08,725 --> 00:52:09,817
Do you like perfume?

732
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,660
Well, I'll see that you get some.

733
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:17,559
I almost sounded like some of
the drummers that hang out here.

734
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:19,829
Only you don't mean it
the way they do.

735
00:52:21,672 --> 00:52:23,970
Say, Barney,
what you say we go fishing?

736
00:52:24,041 --> 00:52:27,010
I know where trouts
is biting good up near Camp Two.

737
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:28,908
Say, that's a great idea.

738
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:31,846
<i>Ja, and when we come back,
we have Swedish dinner.</i>

739
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:33,473
But Mr. Glasgow won't stay.

740
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:35,609
Who said I wouldn’t?
I'm going to stay.

741
00:52:35,686 --> 00:52:37,984
Lotta and I are
going to fix Swedish food.

742
00:52:38,055 --> 00:52:40,853
- Artsoppa, smorgasbord...
- Kaldolmar...

743
00:52:40,924 --> 00:52:43,484
- Plumencreme!
- And potato pancake.

744
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:58,473
Don't tell them that you saw me,
she said they'll know the rest

745
00:52:58,542 --> 00:53:02,535
Tell them I was looking well

746
00:53:05,082 --> 00:53:09,610
And whisper if you get a chance

747
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:18,224
- Karie, you were coming!
- What do you mean, I were coming?

748
00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:22,061
- Did you get everything ready?
- All we have to do is put it on the stove.

749
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:24,657
I'll leave early, and you
come along as soon as you can.

750
00:53:24,735 --> 00:53:27,499
- No, I'll come later.
- Later? Why?

751
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:31,099
I don't want to be there
when Mr. Glasgow comes.

752
00:53:31,174 --> 00:53:33,506
But why, for Pete's sakes?

753
00:53:33,577 --> 00:53:38,537
If I'm not there, and he waits a while
and gets afraid I'm not coming and...

754
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:41,946
- And?
- And then I come.

755
00:53:43,487 --> 00:53:46,979
Why, what are you...
what are you driving at, anyway?

756
00:53:47,858 --> 00:53:48,984
He likes me.

757
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,086
What are you up to, young lady?

758
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:56,064
Now stop grinning and answer me,
or I'll slap you.

759
00:53:56,133 --> 00:53:58,260
You and Pa have been
dumb all your lives.

760
00:53:58,335 --> 00:53:59,632
Thank you, Miss Smarty.

761
00:53:59,703 --> 00:54:02,399
You have. You don't plan,
you just let things happen.

762
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:05,498
I'm not like that.
I've got ideas how I want things to be,

763
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:07,407
and I'm going to get them.

764
00:54:08,378 --> 00:54:10,642
Where does Mr. Glasgow
come into that?

765
00:54:10,714 --> 00:54:14,514
He likes me, and he can do a lot for me
if I make him think I'm worth helping.

766
00:54:14,585 --> 00:54:18,521
I'm Swan Bostrom's daughter,
and I got looks.

767
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:20,955
I'm going to amount to something,
wait and see.

768
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:25,427
Mr. Glasgow thinks I'm too good for
this place, so does Pa, and so do you.

769
00:54:25,495 --> 00:54:26,484
And so do I.

770
00:54:31,702 --> 00:54:32,828
Doesn't that look good?

771
00:54:32,903 --> 00:54:35,463
By gollys, I so hungry,
I think I eat a whole horse.

772
00:54:35,539 --> 00:54:38,133
You go ahead and eat.
Mr. Glasgow must be hungry.

773
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:40,699
<i>- Ja, sit down there.
- No, no, wait a minute.</i>

774
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:43,405
- Isn't Lotta coming?
- She'll be here.

775
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:47,473
<i>- Uncle Swan, pour the schnapps.
- Ja, Lotta be here pretty quick.</i>

776
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:50,782
She have to work late
on account of them fishermen at hotel.

777
00:54:50,854 --> 00:54:54,722
The smorgasbord is the best
I could do. I hope you'll like it.

778
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:57,349
That look nice, Karie.

779
00:54:58,495 --> 00:55:00,292
<i>- Skol.
- Skol.</i>

780
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,522
You don't suppose
she isn't coming?

781
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,730
Karie, Karie!
Down your Sunday throat?

782
00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:10,636
I better get the rest
of the supper.

783
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:17,709
You know, Swan, I've been thinking
of that girl of yours...

784
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:21,547
- and what she said this morning.
- She always talk that way.

785
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:26,646
Maybe she's right.
She's a beautiful girl.

786
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:30,359
- She prettiest girl in Iron Ridge.
- No.

787
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:33,021
- She ain't?
- Well, I didn't mean it that way.

788
00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:34,427
I don't mean just pretty.

789
00:55:35,866 --> 00:55:39,029
Did you see the way those men
looked at her this morning?

790
00:55:40,237 --> 00:55:43,502
- Barney, Lotta's good girl.
- Of course she is.

791
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:47,708
That's why I want
to see her get the right start,

792
00:55:47,778 --> 00:55:52,112
to get somewhere, so she...
What's the matter, your back hurt?

793
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,809
- Little bit.
- What's happened?

794
00:55:53,884 --> 00:55:55,647
Just what I have two year ago.

795
00:55:55,719 --> 00:55:58,153
He's all right,
he's as strong as a woods ox.

796
00:55:58,221 --> 00:56:01,156
- You bet I strong.
- I wonder what's keeping Lotta.

797
00:56:01,224 --> 00:56:02,657
She'll be here any minute.

798
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:04,919
I'd better get her.

799
00:56:04,995 --> 00:56:08,692
No, Mr. Glasgow, she's just
a little late on account of all those...

800
00:56:08,765 --> 00:56:10,460
But maybe she can’t get off.

801
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:12,365
- No, she...
- I better get her.

802
00:56:12,436 --> 00:56:14,063
I know Brotschneider.

803
00:56:15,172 --> 00:56:17,572
- Hello.
- I thought I'd never get here.

804
00:56:17,641 --> 00:56:19,472
They wouldn't stop eating.

805
00:56:20,077 --> 00:56:22,637
Let me help you.
We didn't think you were coming.

806
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:25,238
I ran all the way.
Like to fell down a couple of times.

807
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:26,304
That's too bad.

808
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:33,485
The very idea! She should be waiting
on you instead of you on her. Give me...

809
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:36,492
Here, wait a minute,
I'll put it on. Karie, go away.

810
00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:42,797
The supper's on the table.
It's getting cold.

811
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:46,302
It's a party. I hope you come
to Iron Ridge often, Mr. Glasgow.

812
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:49,634
I'll come if you and Karie
invite me to a supper like this.

813
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:52,072
- Sit down.
- Help yourself, Mr. Glasgow.

814
00:56:52,142 --> 00:56:56,010
- Thank you.
- I'm so hungry, I think I eat two horses.

815
00:56:58,515 --> 00:56:59,539
Uncle Swan.

816
00:57:05,155 --> 00:57:07,350
I'll take that, you get the flowers.

817
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:11,720
- Can you sing?
- Yes, a little.

818
00:57:11,795 --> 00:57:13,854
Sit down
and sing something for us.

819
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:15,830
All right. Play something, Pa.

820
00:57:21,404 --> 00:57:29,607
In the spring
'neath the willow tree

821
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:37,279
Sat and piped, I heard him sing

822
00:57:37,354 --> 00:57:44,123
Singing Arra Lee

823
00:57:44,194 --> 00:57:46,992
Arra Lee

824
00:57:47,063 --> 00:57:49,293
- Arra...
- Stop it! Stop it!

825
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:54,596
I know, Barney.

826
00:57:58,475 --> 00:57:59,772
I know.

827
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:05,074
Barney, you know
"Bird on Nellie's Hat"?

828
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:07,582
You sing that just like you used to
when you were shanty boy.

829
00:58:07,651 --> 00:58:11,382
Uncle Swan always used to tell us
how grand you sung.

830
00:58:12,389 --> 00:58:13,515
Please, Mr. Glasgow.

831
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:17,824
What'll you give me if I do?

832
00:58:17,894 --> 00:58:20,727
Will you give me a kiss?

833
00:58:23,033 --> 00:58:27,129
You sing "Bird on Nellie's Hat"
and Lotta give you a kiss, and Karie,

834
00:58:27,204 --> 00:58:29,638
and you ain't look out,
old Swan give you kiss, too.

835
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:33,072
All right, we'll all sing it.
Go ahead, Swan.

836
00:58:34,444 --> 00:58:37,936
I'll be your little honey,
I will promise that

837
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:41,415
Said Nellie as she rolled
her dreamy eyes

838
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:44,976
It's a shame to take the money,
said the bird on Nellie's hat

839
00:58:45,055 --> 00:58:48,456
Last night she said
the same to Johnny Wise

840
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:52,359
Then to Nellie, Willie whispered
as they fondly kissed

841
00:58:52,429 --> 00:58:55,557
I'll bet that you
were never kissed like that

842
00:58:55,632 --> 00:58:58,829
Well, you don't
know Nellie like I do

843
00:58:58,902 --> 00:59:02,565
Said the saucy little bird
on Nellie's hat

844
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:04,231
And I'll keep your presents, honey

845
00:59:04,307 --> 00:59:05,365
That's it.

846
00:59:09,813 --> 00:59:12,577
By golly, Barney,
you ain't forget how to kiss girl.

847
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:15,140
- Karie, you next.
- Oh, no, no!

848
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:20,287
- What's happened, Uncle Swan?
- Nothing. I just get crick in back.

849
00:59:20,357 --> 00:59:23,622
I don't like this.
You ought to see a doctor.

850
00:59:23,693 --> 00:59:26,093
I'll take you to Chicago
to the best doctor in the country.

851
00:59:26,162 --> 00:59:28,562
- I ain't want to see no doctor.
- Shut up, will ya?

852
00:59:28,632 --> 00:59:31,100
I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll all go to Chicago.

853
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:33,533
Swan can see a doctor,
and we'll have a holiday...

854
00:59:33,603 --> 00:59:36,128
see some good shows and have
a good time. What do you say?

855
00:59:36,206 --> 00:59:37,366
- We have fun?
- Yeah.

856
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,705
Lotta and I have got jobs.
And think of the expense.

857
00:59:40,777 --> 00:59:43,644
- That's my business.
- What will folks say, you taking us?

858
00:59:43,713 --> 00:59:47,342
Karie, if I can’t take my old friend and
his niece and daughter on a holiday,

859
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:50,250
- things have come to a pretty pass.
- He's right. We're going.

860
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,719
Fine! Then it's settled.

861
00:59:51,788 --> 00:59:54,985
Come on, "Nellie's Hat."
We'll all sing it again.

862
00:59:55,058 --> 00:59:59,893
I'll keep your presents, honey,
just for old times' sake

863
00:59:59,963 --> 01:00:03,330
Said Nellie as she rolled
her dreamy eyes

864
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:07,234
She has fixed him good and plenty,
said the bird on Nellie's hat

865
01:00:07,304 --> 01:00:10,865
Oh, Willie, Willie,
when will you be wise?

866
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:14,604
Well, but how about
the diamond engagement ring?

867
01:00:14,678 --> 01:00:17,841
Of course, said Willie,
you'll return me that

868
01:00:17,914 --> 01:00:21,509
Well, you don't
know Nellie like I do

869
01:00:21,584 --> 01:00:27,079
Said the saucy little bird
on Nellie's hat

870
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,419
By George, I got to
get that fixed.

871
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:42,104
Go right in.
Mr. Glasgow's been waiting for you.

872
01:00:42,172 --> 01:00:44,197
Come in, come in.

873
01:00:47,944 --> 01:00:49,104
Hello.

874
01:00:49,179 --> 01:00:52,080
- Well, we are dressed up, aren't we?
- How do we look?

875
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:54,116
- How do you like my hat?
- It's fine.

876
01:00:54,184 --> 01:00:57,517
That owl, he hoot and hoot
and keep me awake two or three nights.

877
01:00:57,587 --> 01:00:59,248
By George, he ain't hooting now.

878
01:00:59,322 --> 01:01:03,190
You shouldn't have told that.
Never mind. I like it.

879
01:01:03,259 --> 01:01:04,954
And I like it, too, Karie.

880
01:01:05,628 --> 01:01:07,095
There we go!

881
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:09,791
Won't you sit down,
make yourself comfortable?

882
01:01:09,866 --> 01:01:11,834
What's this place?

883
01:01:11,901 --> 01:01:14,836
It's a private car. I had it
sent up to take us to Chicago.

884
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:16,838
- Nobody come in but us?
- It's just like heaven.

885
01:01:16,906 --> 01:01:18,373
Of course not.

886
01:01:18,441 --> 01:01:20,409
World you like to have
something to eat now?

887
01:01:20,477 --> 01:01:21,739
- Yes.
- Snowflake.

888
01:01:21,811 --> 01:01:24,075
Tell the steward I want to order
some dinner, have it served in here.

889
01:01:24,147 --> 01:01:25,273
- But...
- Yes!

890
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:27,179
- I beg your pardon?
- Nothing.

891
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:28,774
You were going to say something.

892
01:01:28,852 --> 01:01:30,649
I thought we were going
to eat in the dining car.

893
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:34,417
I've never been in one. I've watched
them go by with people eating,

894
01:01:34,491 --> 01:01:37,016
and I thought how grand I'd feel
if I were there, too.

895
01:01:37,093 --> 01:01:38,583
Bless your heart.

896
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:43,321
Never mind about the steward.
We'll eat in the dining car.

897
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:44,992
It's perfectly all right.

898
01:01:45,068 --> 01:01:46,501
We're here to have a lot of fun,

899
01:01:46,569 --> 01:01:48,434
and you can have
anything that you want.

900
01:01:48,505 --> 01:01:50,405
<i>- Do you want to eat now?
- Ja!</i>

901
01:01:50,473 --> 01:01:52,407
All right, come and get it!

902
01:01:53,443 --> 01:01:54,637
Come and get it!

903
01:01:57,914 --> 01:02:00,610
Hello, Mr. Glasgow.
It's nice to have you with us again.

904
01:02:00,683 --> 01:02:02,207
- Thank you, Clem.
- I've saved you a nice table.

905
01:02:02,285 --> 01:02:03,775
- That's fine.
- This way, please.

906
01:02:07,490 --> 01:02:09,958
- Hi, Barney.
- Well, hello, Charlie.

907
01:02:10,026 --> 01:02:11,857
Sit down.
I'll be with you in a minute.

908
01:02:11,928 --> 01:02:13,486
What are you doing
up in this neck of the woods?

909
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:15,827
- Been up fishing at Twin Forks.
- Any luck?

910
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:17,890
Only fair.
What are you doing up here?

911
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:21,630
I'm on my way to Chicago.
This is Swan Bostrom and his folks.

912
01:02:22,372 --> 01:02:23,771
He and I used to be loggers together.

913
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:25,865
He hurt his back.
I'm taking him to a specialist.

914
01:02:25,942 --> 01:02:28,001
Nothing the matter
with the girl, though, is there?

915
01:02:29,779 --> 01:02:32,839
Don't be silly.
I'm old enough to be her father.

916
01:02:32,916 --> 01:02:36,181
- That's what I always tell’em.
- You old polecat.

917
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:38,880
Come into my car,
we'll have a little brandy after dinner.

918
01:02:43,626 --> 01:02:46,151
I've eaten too much!
I've got to take off my coat.

919
01:02:46,229 --> 01:02:48,356
I'm glad to sit down again.

920
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:50,592
- Will you smoke a cigar, Swan?
- Thanks, Barney.

921
01:02:50,667 --> 01:02:54,501
Well, you've had dinner in a diner.
Did you enjoy it?

922
01:02:54,571 --> 01:02:57,005
No. No, I didn't.

923
01:02:57,073 --> 01:02:59,200
- Lotta!
- You didn't? What was wrong?

924
01:02:59,275 --> 01:03:00,401
Look at us.

925
01:03:00,477 --> 01:03:02,911
- Why didn't you tell us we look so funny?
- You didn't look funny.

926
01:03:02,979 --> 01:03:04,003
Yes, we did.

927
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:05,377
I saw those other women
laughing at us.

928
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,279
They were laughing
at this and Karie's owl.

929
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:08,374
Nobody laughed at my owl.

930
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:11,249
They did. They were
polite enough to try to hide it.

931
01:03:11,321 --> 01:03:13,881
You knew before you took us in there.
Why didn't you tell us?

932
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:16,050
Perhaps your clothes aren't
what they ought to be...

933
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:19,459
- They're all right in Iron Ridge.
- That's why I wanted to...

934
01:03:21,931 --> 01:03:23,228
I guess I belong there.

935
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:26,200
I'll never be able
to fit in with people like that.

936
01:03:26,269 --> 01:03:30,865
Yes, you will, for the simple reason
that you realize something is wrong.

937
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:32,669
Don't worry
what other women will think

938
01:03:32,742 --> 01:03:36,234
because wherever you go, Lotta,
they'll all wish they were like you.

939
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:39,107
And as far as
the clothes are concerned,

940
01:03:39,182 --> 01:03:41,047
we can take care
of that in Chicago.

941
01:03:49,092 --> 01:03:51,151
- Good evening, Mr. Glasgow.
- Good evening, Gene.

942
01:03:52,896 --> 01:03:54,090
- Good evening.
- How are you, George?

943
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:56,598
Good evening, madame.
Your table is all ready.

944
01:03:56,666 --> 01:03:57,690
Thank you.

945
01:04:22,492 --> 01:04:24,255
Very glad to see you again,
Mr. Glasgow.

946
01:04:24,327 --> 01:04:26,557
Thank you, George.
Take this lamp away.

947
01:04:26,629 --> 01:04:29,393
Let us have a bottle of Cliquot'92
and we'll order dinner later.

948
01:04:29,465 --> 01:04:31,490
- Yes, Mr. Glasgow.
- Well?

949
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:37,434
You go ahead, Uncle Swan.

950
01:04:37,507 --> 01:04:40,567
I was just going to say it's a fine place
for two old shanty boys.

951
01:04:40,643 --> 01:04:43,806
Certainly different
from the dining room in Iron Ridge.

952
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,781
My corset's killing me,
but I feel like a queen.

953
01:04:46,849 --> 01:04:48,510
And look like one.

954
01:04:48,585 --> 01:04:51,418
- And you, Lotta?
- Oh, it's beautiful.

955
01:04:51,487 --> 01:04:54,684
You can’t very well say that
they laughed at you this time.

956
01:04:54,757 --> 01:04:57,624
- No, they didn't, did they?
- And are you happy?

957
01:04:57,694 --> 01:05:00,219
You have no idea.
I'll never be able to thank you enough.

958
01:05:00,797 --> 01:05:04,233
It's more than I even dreamed about it.
It's so lovely, it's like...

959
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:07,499
I'm afraid to even think
about going back.

960
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:10,767
Don't think about Iron Ridge
because you’re not going back.

961
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,467
Wait a minute.

962
01:05:12,542 --> 01:05:16,137
I don't want any arguments
until you hear what I've figured out.

963
01:05:16,212 --> 01:05:18,510
I'm going to take you all back
to Bewdamore with me.

964
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:20,242
- We can’t go.
- Yes, you can.

965
01:05:20,316 --> 01:05:22,910
Now, you want to go to school
and learn something, don't you?

966
01:05:22,986 --> 01:05:23,975
Oh, yes.

967
01:05:24,053 --> 01:05:27,489
Well, you’re going to have that chance,
and a lot more, too.

968
01:05:29,158 --> 01:05:32,321
- And Swan can have a job in the mill.
- I don't want no job at mill.

969
01:05:32,395 --> 01:05:35,193
Of course you do. I need a man
like you in the wood room.

970
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:39,429
Half of them don't know the difference
between a hemlock and a red oak.

971
01:05:39,502 --> 01:05:42,835
I've got a nice cottage on the peninsula
and you can live there.

972
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:45,032
- Now, it's up to you, Swan.
- Well, Barney...

973
01:05:45,108 --> 01:05:48,475
Try it for a while. You don't
have to stay there if you don't like it.

974
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:51,913
We could have a drink together
once in a long, long while.

975
01:05:54,317 --> 01:05:56,376
By George,
I think we try it.

976
01:05:56,452 --> 01:05:58,613
All right, that's settled.

977
01:05:58,688 --> 01:06:02,488
We were talking about a good time?
Good! Let's begin now.

978
01:06:09,499 --> 01:06:11,933
There you are, old hoot-hoot.

979
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:14,936
You look better on stick
than you do on Karie's hat.

980
01:06:16,406 --> 01:06:19,341
<i>Ja, I got good place
for you, too.</i>

981
01:06:42,899 --> 01:06:44,594
You better stop practicing.

982
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:47,602
The automobile will be here,
and you won't be dressed.

983
01:06:48,204 --> 01:06:50,195
Doesn't it look nice
with the curtains up?

984
01:06:50,273 --> 01:06:52,503
Oh, Karie, it's like heaven.

985
01:06:52,575 --> 01:06:56,511
This is the Valhalla that us Swedes
have been yelling about all our lives.

986
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:01,079
Isn't it wonderful,
everything Mr. Glasgow's doing for Pa?

987
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:03,916
Where'd those roses come from?

988
01:07:04,954 --> 01:07:06,546
Mr. Glasgow sent them.

989
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:08,650
To you and me.

990
01:07:08,725 --> 01:07:13,492
Lotta, you don't suppose he...
You don't think that...

991
01:07:13,563 --> 01:07:14,621
What?

992
01:07:15,932 --> 01:07:19,368
It's just got to be your Pa
Mr. Glasgow's doing all this for.

993
01:07:19,435 --> 01:07:21,130
Of course.

994
01:07:21,204 --> 01:07:23,001
I've sometimes wondered if...

995
01:07:23,473 --> 01:07:26,374
It sometimes worries me
that it might be you.

996
01:07:27,176 --> 01:07:28,200
Karie, are you trying...

997
01:07:28,277 --> 01:07:30,507
I know it's awful,
but he is interested in you.

998
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:32,741
Maybe more than he ought to be.

999
01:07:32,815 --> 01:07:34,783
How can you say such a thing?

1000
01:07:34,851 --> 01:07:37,251
You know Mr. Glasgow's
interested in me on account of Pa.

1001
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,788
- I wonder if he is.
- Of course he is.

1002
01:07:39,856 --> 01:07:42,586
How can you say such a thing?
How can you even think it?

1003
01:07:42,658 --> 01:07:45,786
- You'll spoil everything.
- I can’t spoil anything unless it's true.

1004
01:07:45,862 --> 01:07:48,023
- Now, listen, Lotta...
- I won't listen to anything.

1005
01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:49,359
Because you’re afraid to.

1006
01:07:49,432 --> 01:07:51,457
You’re just as scared
as I am that it's true.

1007
01:07:51,534 --> 01:07:52,865
No, I'm not.

1008
01:07:53,436 --> 01:07:54,630
I'm not.

1009
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:15,517
You come from Mr. Glasgow?

1010
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:19,083
<i>Ja, he send me to fetch you
and your family to the mill.</i>

1011
01:08:19,162 --> 01:08:21,528
I go get Karie and Lotta.

1012
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:23,360
- You come in the house?
- No.

1013
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:26,834
I'll keep an eye
on this newfangled contraption here.

1014
01:08:26,903 --> 01:08:29,804
<i>- It's liable to blow up.
- Ja.</i>

1015
01:08:29,872 --> 01:08:31,931
And I don't care if it does!

1016
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:37,837
- You ain't like horseless carriage?
- I hate the pesky stink wagons.

1017
01:08:37,914 --> 01:08:39,973
I've seen ornery horses in my time,

1018
01:08:40,049 --> 01:08:43,450
but none as infuriating
as this infernal machine.

1019
01:08:45,488 --> 01:08:48,685
What we do if she
blow up with us today?

1020
01:08:48,758 --> 01:08:50,783
We worry about that after.

1021
01:08:53,563 --> 01:08:55,394
If we need to.

1022
01:09:00,736 --> 01:09:02,135
Hi, Josie.

1023
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:06,037
It wouldn’t be natural
if I didn't trip over that thing.

1024
01:09:06,108 --> 01:09:07,803
What's on your mind, Josie?

1025
01:09:08,344 --> 01:09:11,745
Here's the report
on your bleaching process.

1026
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:13,975
All right, all right.

1027
01:09:15,084 --> 01:09:16,813
I never felt so much like working.

1028
01:09:16,886 --> 01:09:19,013
You certainly look better
since you got back...

1029
01:09:19,088 --> 01:09:21,056
younger or something.

1030
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:24,289
That north country
does you a lot of good.

1031
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:25,691
Fishing makes a new man of you.

1032
01:09:25,761 --> 01:09:29,026
Fishing? You look as though
you just shot a lion.

1033
01:09:31,234 --> 01:09:33,759
- Josie!
- Yes, sir?

1034
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:36,600
Have a telephone installed
in the cottage for the Bostroms.

1035
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:38,264
Have it done right away.

1036
01:09:38,341 --> 01:09:40,502
And send a box of...

1037
01:09:42,078 --> 01:09:43,875
That's all, Josie.

1038
01:09:45,114 --> 01:09:47,139
- This letter you wrote to McLennan...
- What about it?

1039
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:48,808
- You can’t do that.
- Why not?

1040
01:09:48,885 --> 01:09:50,011
The government won't let you.

1041
01:09:50,086 --> 01:09:53,249
I cut my timber, fix my rates,
and ship my logs as I see fit.

1042
01:09:53,322 --> 01:09:55,017
I always have and always will.

1043
01:09:55,091 --> 01:09:57,525
And, Josie, let me know
as soon as those people get here.

1044
01:09:57,593 --> 01:09:58,582
Yes, sir.

1045
01:09:59,395 --> 01:10:03,229
- Don't you realize times have changed?
- I don't want to argue about it. I'm busy.

1046
01:10:04,967 --> 01:10:06,901
Expecting the Bostroms?

1047
01:10:07,436 --> 01:10:08,425
Yes.

1048
01:10:09,305 --> 01:10:12,103
They say that daughter of Swan's
is a pippin. Is she?

1049
01:10:13,342 --> 01:10:16,971
I don't know. Just a big Swede.
Nice kid, though.

1050
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:20,547
- They're here, Mr. Glasgow.
- Well, bring them in.

1051
01:10:20,616 --> 01:10:22,345
Or do I have to
go after them myself?

1052
01:10:22,418 --> 01:10:23,908
Will you please come in?

1053
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:26,817
Hello, Swan.
How are you?

1054
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:28,447
- Richard!
- Hello, Karie.

1055
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:30,583
- Haven't seen you in a long time.
- Glad to see you.

1056
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:34,926
- Glad to see you, too, Swan.
- You've grown to be a big fellow, ain't you?

1057
01:10:34,997 --> 01:10:37,431
And do you like Bewdamore
and business college?

1058
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:40,060
- Everything's perfect, Mr. Glasgow.
- That's fine.

1059
01:10:40,136 --> 01:10:42,696
We know you’re doing
all this for Uncle Swan,

1060
01:10:42,772 --> 01:10:44,569
but we'll never
be able to thank you enough.

1061
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:49,441
Nonsense! I'm doing it for Lotta
and for you and Swan... all of you.

1062
01:10:49,512 --> 01:10:52,072
You've certainly made us all
very happy, Mr. Glasgow.

1063
01:10:52,148 --> 01:10:53,740
Aren't you happy, Karie?

1064
01:10:53,816 --> 01:10:57,217
So happy I haven't dared pinch
myself since we left Iron Ridge.

1065
01:10:57,286 --> 01:10:59,277
That was the general idea.

1066
01:11:01,524 --> 01:11:04,254
This is my son Richard.
Miss Karie Linbeck.

1067
01:11:04,327 --> 01:11:07,262
- How do you do, Miss Linbeck?
- How do you do, Mr. Richard?

1068
01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:09,662
Please, do call me Karie.
Everybody does.

1069
01:11:09,732 --> 01:11:11,495
Of course I will... Karie.

1070
01:11:11,567 --> 01:11:12,932
This is Lotta Bostrom.

1071
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:14,258
Hello.

1072
01:11:14,337 --> 01:11:17,636
Come along, girls.
I'll show you through the mill.

1073
01:11:17,707 --> 01:11:21,165
Father, before you go, Van and I
have been having a little disagreement.

1074
01:11:21,243 --> 01:11:23,768
The girls have been ripping
the safety catches off the cutters again.

1075
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:27,043
- Well, what of it?
- Van won't do anything about it...

1076
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:30,210
How many times have I told you
that whatever Van says goes?

1077
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:32,379
I don't want to hear
any more about it.

1078
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:35,686
And, Swan, I'll show you what we do
to a tree after you chop it down.

1079
01:11:35,758 --> 01:11:37,555
- Bye.
- Bye.

1080
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:39,254
I want you to see that wood room, too.

1081
01:11:39,328 --> 01:11:40,795
That's where you start
Monday morning.

1082
01:11:42,832 --> 01:11:44,993
- Pretty, isn't she?
- Is she!

1083
01:11:45,067 --> 01:11:48,127
If you felt the building shaking just then,
that was me falling for her.

1084
01:11:48,204 --> 01:11:49,899
Somebody else must have fallen, too.

1085
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:52,600
You ought to see the bills
for clothes from Chicago.

1086
01:12:30,246 --> 01:12:32,612
- Good evening, Mr. Glasgow.
- Good evening.

1087
01:12:32,682 --> 01:12:33,944
Won't you come in?

1088
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:39,388
Pa and Karie just went out
for a walk and I'm making...

1089
01:12:39,455 --> 01:12:41,150
And you’re waiting
for my father.

1090
01:12:41,223 --> 01:12:44,090
Well, he's not coming.
He's at home where he ought to be.

1091
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:46,492
Now look here, Miss Bostrom,
I've come to tell you

1092
01:12:46,562 --> 01:12:48,757
you've got to stop making a fool
out of my father.

1093
01:12:48,831 --> 01:12:50,958
Everybody in town's
talking about it.

1094
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:53,831
What is it you want off him?
Money? If it's money...

1095
01:12:53,903 --> 01:12:55,700
What do you mean
by saying those things?

1096
01:12:55,771 --> 01:12:56,760
It's true.

1097
01:12:56,839 --> 01:12:59,330
- Keep still.
- Now, you wait a minute.

1098
01:12:59,408 --> 01:13:02,673
Now look here, Miss Bostrom,
don't you hit me again.

1099
01:13:02,745 --> 01:13:06,112
If I'm wrong about you, all you
have to do is say so. I'll believe you.

1100
01:13:06,182 --> 01:13:09,276
<i>I'm sorry, but you
are wrong, Mr. Glasgow.</i>

1101
01:13:09,351 --> 01:13:11,546
- That's nothing. It's burning.
- What's burning?

1102
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:13,713
It's just my candy.
You mustn’t believe...

1103
01:13:13,789 --> 01:13:17,190
- Don't you think that you...
- All right, I'll fix it.

1104
01:13:17,259 --> 01:13:19,250
Don't you go away.
You stay here.

1105
01:13:26,602 --> 01:13:28,797
Gee, it smells good.
Here, I'll fix it.

1106
01:13:30,172 --> 01:13:31,366
Oh, it's hot!

1107
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:36,544
You've fixed it.

1108
01:13:37,379 --> 01:13:39,006
You've fixed everything.

1109
01:13:40,015 --> 01:13:41,607
Gee, I'm sorry, Miss Bostrom.

1110
01:13:41,684 --> 01:13:42,878
It was darn clumsy of me.

1111
01:13:42,952 --> 01:13:45,079
What's the matter,
did you burn your hand?

1112
01:13:45,154 --> 01:13:46,621
No!

1113
01:13:48,991 --> 01:13:51,016
You've got tears in your eyes.

1114
01:13:51,794 --> 01:13:53,728
Because everything's spoiled.

1115
01:13:53,796 --> 01:13:56,890
It's only sugar and water.
That's nothing to cry about.

1116
01:13:56,966 --> 01:13:58,763
That's not what
I'm crying about.

1117
01:13:58,834 --> 01:14:00,961
I never should have
come to Bewdamore.

1118
01:14:01,036 --> 01:14:04,699
Well, all right, but we've got to do
something about cleaning up this mess.

1119
01:14:05,574 --> 01:14:07,667
Look where you’re going!

1120
01:14:13,249 --> 01:14:15,683
Don't walk around.
You'll get it all over the kitchen.

1121
01:14:16,685 --> 01:14:18,653
I've made a mess of everything.

1122
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:22,755
It's sticky.

1123
01:14:22,825 --> 01:14:25,157
Of course it is.
It's that kind of candy.

1124
01:14:25,227 --> 01:14:26,751
Well, I don't...

1125
01:14:28,264 --> 01:14:30,698
Well, why don't you stop crying
and do something?!

1126
01:14:36,172 --> 01:14:39,938
The art of paper-making goes
as far back as the ancient Chinese.

1127
01:14:40,009 --> 01:14:42,375
They were the first ones to discover
paper could be made

1128
01:14:42,444 --> 01:14:44,503
from a fibrous matter
reduced to pulp.

1129
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:46,844
Really? I never knew
that the Chinese had...

1130
01:14:46,916 --> 01:14:51,376
Yes, the ancient Chinese were one
of the most inventive and cultured races

1131
01:14:51,453 --> 01:14:53,182
the world has ever known.

1132
01:14:53,255 --> 01:14:55,189
I'd love to go to China.
Wouldn’t you?

1133
01:14:55,257 --> 01:14:56,281
Yes, I would.

1134
01:14:56,358 --> 01:14:58,952
Wouldn’t it be fun to ride in a rickshaw
and eat with chopsticks?

1135
01:14:59,028 --> 01:15:01,155
See the temples
and the Great Wall.

1136
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:03,425
Just imagine
the Taj Mahal in the moonlight.

1137
01:15:04,033 --> 01:15:05,466
It'd be wonderful.

1138
01:15:06,468 --> 01:15:10,564
Of course, the Taj Mahal isn't in China,
but that wouldn’t make any difference.

1139
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:16,538
Don't stop pulling.
It gets just like fly paper.

1140
01:15:16,612 --> 01:15:18,807
Go on and tell me more
about paper-making.

1141
01:15:18,881 --> 01:15:22,078
Well, the Arabs learned it
from the Chinese.

1142
01:15:22,151 --> 01:15:26,986
And the Crusaders who visited
Byzantium and Syria and Palestine

1143
01:15:27,056 --> 01:15:28,580
learned it from the Arabs.

1144
01:15:28,657 --> 01:15:32,252
And then, well,
it came on down to us.

1145
01:15:32,328 --> 01:15:35,024
Oh, Mr. Glasgow,
isn't history wonderful?

1146
01:15:35,798 --> 01:15:38,961
Gee, it never seemed
so darned wonderful before.

1147
01:15:46,909 --> 01:15:48,843
We shouldn't have stopped pulling this.

1148
01:15:51,113 --> 01:15:53,172
- Look out!
- You take that.

1149
01:15:53,249 --> 01:15:54,876
This is awful!

1150
01:16:03,325 --> 01:16:06,089
Swan Bostrom's outside.
Wants to see you. Says it's important.

1151
01:16:06,161 --> 01:16:07,685
Well, he ought to know.

1152
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:10,998
- Shall I have him come in?
- Of course have him come in.

1153
01:16:12,201 --> 01:16:14,328
- Come in, Svensk.
- Hey, Barney.

1154
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:17,167
You look great.
What's on your mind?

1155
01:16:17,973 --> 01:16:20,635
- I've come to talk about the job.
- What's the matter with it?

1156
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:23,109
It's a fine job, Barney,
only ain't no work to it.

1157
01:16:23,178 --> 01:16:25,840
I sit all day like loafer
and just look at wood.

1158
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:28,281
Fella say, "What that?"
I say, "That hemlook."

1159
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:30,648
He say, "What that?"
I say, "That pine. Ain't you know?"

1160
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:33,347
He say, "Sure, I know,
but you have to tell me."

1161
01:16:34,323 --> 01:16:36,484
That ain't good job
for old timberwolf.

1162
01:16:36,558 --> 01:16:39,527
All right, Swan, I'll see that your
loafing stops if that's what you want.

1163
01:16:42,998 --> 01:16:45,228
- Hello, Swan.
- Hello, Richard.

1164
01:16:45,301 --> 01:16:47,861
- You get candy out of hair?
- Yeah, most of it.

1165
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:49,336
We made an awful mess
of your kitchen.

1166
01:16:49,405 --> 01:16:50,429
That all right.

1167
01:16:50,506 --> 01:16:53,134
Lotta clean up kitchen fine.

1168
01:16:53,208 --> 01:16:55,472
Richard and Lotta
make candy last night.

1169
01:16:55,544 --> 01:16:57,068
Too bad you ain't come over.

1170
01:16:57,146 --> 01:16:58,943
We have nice time.

1171
01:16:59,014 --> 01:17:02,780
I'll have a meeting, Swan.
I'll see that your loafing stops.

1172
01:17:02,851 --> 01:17:06,343
- You know I active cuss, Barney.
- Sure.

1173
01:17:06,422 --> 01:17:08,913
- Thank you. Bye.
- Good-bye, Swan.

1174
01:17:11,393 --> 01:17:14,362
Van says that Eastern crowd
is going to open offices in Chicago

1175
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:16,022
if the panic dies down.

1176
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,969
- How do you happen to go there?
- Go where?

1177
01:17:21,036 --> 01:17:23,300
To Lotta's. Bostrom's house.

1178
01:17:23,372 --> 01:17:26,967
Well, I just went down there to
invite them to the employees' party.

1179
01:17:27,042 --> 01:17:31,376
You personally invite
all the employees to their annual party?

1180
01:17:31,447 --> 01:17:33,415
Now look here, young man,
you've got other things to do

1181
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:36,280
beside going around
with a millhand's daughter.

1182
01:17:36,352 --> 01:17:38,877
- You go down there.
- Well, that's different.

1183
01:17:39,955 --> 01:17:42,150
I go down there to see
my old friend Swan.

1184
01:17:43,392 --> 01:17:45,292
A pig's eye, you do.

1185
01:18:03,145 --> 01:18:04,578
Take a letter.

1186
01:18:04,646 --> 01:18:06,876
Wait a minute.
This'll interest you.

1187
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:10,876
Somebody took a might pretty
young lady out to lunch this noon.

1188
01:18:13,255 --> 01:18:15,689
Mr. Russell A. Eubank,
Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

1189
01:18:15,758 --> 01:18:17,783
My dear Russ,
as you will recall,

1190
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:19,725
I've been considering opening
a New York office,

1191
01:18:19,795 --> 01:18:23,390
as the time seems right
for many reasons.

1192
01:18:23,465 --> 01:18:24,932
I propose to put you in charge

1193
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,468
and place under you as your assistant
my son Richard,

1194
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:29,663
- who is familiar with...
- I won't go.

1195
01:18:37,012 --> 01:18:38,502
"Who is familiar with..."

1196
01:18:39,815 --> 01:18:41,305
Never mind the letter.

1197
01:18:45,054 --> 01:18:48,546
Mrs. Glasgow telephoned that
she'd pick you up at 5:00.

1198
01:18:50,025 --> 01:18:51,151
All right.

1199
01:19:03,005 --> 01:19:06,202
- I want to talk to you about something.
- Go ahead.

1200
01:19:06,275 --> 01:19:08,402
- Serious. Do you mind?
- No.

1201
01:19:08,477 --> 01:19:10,672
Oh, I see how you do it.

1202
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:12,373
What is it you want
to talk to me about?

1203
01:19:12,448 --> 01:19:15,508
I've broken my engagement
with Orville Bremmer.

1204
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:16,573
You what?

1205
01:19:16,652 --> 01:19:19,018
Yep. This afternoon.

1206
01:19:19,088 --> 01:19:22,615
It's all over
and I feel so much better.

1207
01:19:22,691 --> 01:19:25,660
So you finally did it.
I was hoping that...

1208
01:19:25,727 --> 01:19:28,890
- Were you, Barney?
- Well, I didn't like him anyway.

1209
01:19:28,964 --> 01:19:32,297
You might have helped me out a little
when Mother was talking me into it.

1210
01:19:32,367 --> 01:19:33,664
Oh, I know.

1211
01:19:35,003 --> 01:19:38,063
- What made you change your mind?
- Several reasons.

1212
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:41,507
- Tony in particular.
- Tony who?

1213
01:19:41,577 --> 01:19:44,011
- Tony Schwerke.
- Tony Schwerke?

1214
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:46,980
Don't keep repeating like that.
You look so dumb.

1215
01:19:47,049 --> 01:19:50,610
The only Schwerkes I know are
the bohunks that live down in the flats.

1216
01:19:50,686 --> 01:19:53,280
- Tony's one of those bohunks.
- What?

1217
01:19:53,355 --> 01:19:56,290
He's in charge of the room where
the big tubs are over at the mill.

1218
01:19:56,358 --> 01:19:58,258
He's been working for you
since he was 14.

1219
01:19:58,327 --> 01:20:01,125
- What does he look like?
- He's tall and...

1220
01:20:01,196 --> 01:20:03,130
Where'd you meet him?
At the mill?

1221
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:05,291
No, in the mud
out on the state road.

1222
01:20:05,367 --> 01:20:08,268
I was stuck and Tony came along
and got under the car.

1223
01:20:08,337 --> 01:20:10,362
All I could see
was his legs sticking out.

1224
01:20:10,439 --> 01:20:13,738
I had to laugh. He looked
so funny and dumb and sweet,

1225
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:16,209
like a bug that had
got turned upside down.

1226
01:20:16,278 --> 01:20:18,940
Evvie, you can’t fool around
with a boy like that.

1227
01:20:19,014 --> 01:20:22,381
You can’t do it.
Break your mother's heart.

1228
01:20:23,185 --> 01:20:25,085
No, I won't.

1229
01:20:25,154 --> 01:20:27,816
There won't be anything left to break
when you get through.

1230
01:20:29,758 --> 01:20:31,453
What are you talking about?

1231
01:20:31,994 --> 01:20:33,552
I think you know, Barney.

1232
01:20:34,863 --> 01:20:37,024
- Have you been listening to...
- No.

1233
01:20:37,099 --> 01:20:39,567
I didn't have to listen to anyone.

1234
01:20:39,635 --> 01:20:41,660
I don't blame you, not really.

1235
01:20:41,737 --> 01:20:44,729
I don't know enough about it.
I don't wanna know.

1236
01:20:44,806 --> 01:20:46,899
But I do know
you've been unhappy.

1237
01:20:47,509 --> 01:20:51,775
Barney, if I don't marry Tony,
I'll be unhappy like that, too.

1238
01:20:52,814 --> 01:20:55,977
If I let Mother talk me
into marrying Orville,

1239
01:20:56,051 --> 01:20:57,541
I'd be unfaithful to him.

1240
01:20:57,619 --> 01:20:59,780
- Evvie!
- I would.

1241
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:01,823
I know I would
if Tony wanted me to.

1242
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:05,382
- Evvie, you can’t talk that way.
- Why not, if I think it?

1243
01:21:05,460 --> 01:21:09,123
When you love someone like that,
there isn't anything you wouldn’t do.

1244
01:21:09,932 --> 01:21:11,160
Not anything.

1245
01:21:14,036 --> 01:21:17,028
Please, Barney,
don't ask me to give him up,

1246
01:21:17,105 --> 01:21:18,868
not even for Mother.

1247
01:21:18,941 --> 01:21:22,308
All my life I've done what she's
wanted me to, but I can’t anymore.

1248
01:21:23,345 --> 01:21:25,074
Please, Barney, help me.

1249
01:21:26,748 --> 01:21:28,613
You’re the only one who can.

1250
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:35,720
I haven't been
much help to you, have I?

1251
01:21:37,759 --> 01:21:39,192
You’re right, Evvie.

1252
01:21:40,929 --> 01:21:42,897
When you love anybody like that...

1253
01:21:45,934 --> 01:21:48,562
You can have a million
bohunks if you want’em.

1254
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:53,033
- I only want one.
- And you’re going to have him.

1255
01:22:00,415 --> 01:22:03,282
Hey, Joe,
a little more steam on this one!

1256
01:22:03,352 --> 01:22:06,219
Turn it up!
Up! Up!

1257
01:22:06,288 --> 01:22:08,449
- Say, what's your name?
- Hold it!

1258
01:22:09,324 --> 01:22:11,918
You know what my name is.
Put it down a little.

1259
01:22:11,994 --> 01:22:13,894
Say, Schwerke,
who do you think you’re talking to?

1260
01:22:13,962 --> 01:22:15,395
Hold it!

1261
01:22:15,464 --> 01:22:17,364
I thought this would be
the way you’d take it.

1262
01:22:17,432 --> 01:22:18,421
What'd you say?

1263
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:20,229
I thought this would be
the way you’d take it.

1264
01:22:20,302 --> 01:22:22,327
You might just as well
fire me now as later.

1265
01:22:22,404 --> 01:22:26,204
- Hold it there.
- Come back here! Come back here!

1266
01:22:26,275 --> 01:22:28,835
- Are you in love with my daughter?
- Sure I am.

1267
01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:33,210
You needn't get so mad about it.
How are you? I'm glad to see you.

1268
01:22:33,282 --> 01:22:35,807
- Let's go up in the office and talk it over.
- I'd like to.

1269
01:22:35,884 --> 01:22:36,873
Come along.

1270
01:22:40,355 --> 01:22:41,583
Look out for that...

1271
01:22:46,495 --> 01:22:48,963
- Smoke a cigar?
- No, thanks.

1272
01:22:49,031 --> 01:22:51,022
- Cigarettes, I suppose.
- Sometimes.

1273
01:22:53,001 --> 01:22:56,232
This paper cup of yours looks
as if it had possibilities.

1274
01:22:56,305 --> 01:22:57,772
I'm sure it has, Mr. Glasgow.

1275
01:22:57,839 --> 01:23:00,774
Richard thinks so, too.
He and I are partners in it.

1276
01:23:04,946 --> 01:23:05,935
Sit down.

1277
01:23:07,949 --> 01:23:09,712
- Send Richard in.
- Yes, sir.

1278
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:21,652
- Do you want to marry my daughter?
- No.

1279
01:23:22,964 --> 01:23:25,125
- Why not?
- I couldn't keep her.

1280
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:28,067
- Is that your only reason?
- Of course it is!

1281
01:23:28,136 --> 01:23:31,594
- You needn't snap my head off.
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

1282
01:23:32,274 --> 01:23:33,536
Come in, Richard.

1283
01:23:34,309 --> 01:23:36,300
- Hello, Mr. Schwerke.
- Hello.

1284
01:23:36,378 --> 01:23:39,313
You better get your patents out
on this paper cup as fast as you can.

1285
01:23:39,381 --> 01:23:40,370
Yes, sir.

1286
01:23:40,449 --> 01:23:42,246
How many do you think
you can turn out in a day?

1287
01:23:42,317 --> 01:23:44,581
With this machine we've planned,
several hundred gross.

1288
01:23:44,653 --> 01:23:47,952
All right. I'll tell the superintendent
to give you a free hand.

1289
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:49,957
Schwerke, you and your family

1290
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:51,959
are coming over to the party
tomorrow night, aren't you?

1291
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:53,494
- Yes, sir.
- Well, that's fine.

1292
01:23:53,562 --> 01:23:56,690
- I want Mrs. Glasgow to meet you.
- Thanks.

1293
01:23:56,765 --> 01:23:57,857
Be careful there.

1294
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:04,767
According to the censors reports
of two years ago,

1295
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:08,401
the capital invested in
Lumber operations in the United States

1296
01:24:08,477 --> 01:24:13,312
was $90,564,862.

1297
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:21,721
The number of employees
was 146,596.

1298
01:24:23,091 --> 01:24:28,085
Their wages made
a total of 66 million...

1299
01:24:35,937 --> 01:24:40,465
86,000,944,000... lumber.

1300
01:24:42,043 --> 01:24:43,067
Now...

1301
01:24:44,312 --> 01:24:48,009
Well, that just goes to show you
the condition this country's in.

1302
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:50,950
<i>- Ja, that right, Richard.
- Yes, of course that's right.</i>

1303
01:24:51,019 --> 01:24:53,954
Why, if my Grandfather Hewitt
had replanted 50 years ago,

1304
01:24:54,022 --> 01:24:55,284
the old money-grabber,

1305
01:24:55,357 --> 01:24:58,224
and my father had
replanted 25 years ago,

1306
01:24:58,293 --> 01:25:00,761
there'd be something up there
for my children to cut.

1307
01:25:00,829 --> 01:25:03,730
That is, if I ever
have any children.

1308
01:25:04,966 --> 01:25:05,990
Well...

1309
01:25:29,191 --> 01:25:30,317
Your Pa always say,

1310
01:25:30,392 --> 01:25:31,916
"Let the government
replant if they want to.

1311
01:25:31,993 --> 01:25:33,961
United States got plenty money."

1312
01:25:34,029 --> 01:25:36,122
Yes, that sounds just like him.

1313
01:25:36,198 --> 01:25:38,758
You can’t ravage a country
of its timber.

1314
01:25:38,834 --> 01:25:42,235
We haven't any right to leave
a wasteland of scarred pine stumps...

1315
01:25:43,004 --> 01:25:45,268
- Barney!
- Hello, Mr. Glasgow.

1316
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:49,071
Why don't you hire a hall
or get a soap box in the park?

1317
01:25:49,144 --> 01:25:52,204
Did Richard have you strapped
in your chair, giving you a lecture?

1318
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:55,477
He talks wonderful, Mr. Glasgow.
He's awfully interesting.

1319
01:25:55,550 --> 01:25:58,678
I don't know how I got on the platform.
I'm sorry if I bored you.

1320
01:25:58,753 --> 01:26:01,551
You don't have to listen to him
because he's the boss' son.

1321
01:26:01,623 --> 01:26:04,786
He goes on that way all the time
like a Negro preacher.

1322
01:26:04,860 --> 01:26:06,919
He'll talk an arm off
if you let him.

1323
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:09,623
Yeah, that's right.
Just a regular windbag.

1324
01:26:09,698 --> 01:26:12,690
Should have stopped me.
Well, good night.

1325
01:26:12,767 --> 01:26:14,064
- Good night.
- Good night, Richard.

1326
01:26:14,135 --> 01:26:16,729
- I go to gate with you, Richard.
- Come again, won't you?

1327
01:26:16,805 --> 01:26:18,363
Thank you.

1328
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:20,135
Have you got any coffee krantzes?

1329
01:26:20,208 --> 01:26:23,473
Sure. I made some this morning.
If there are any left.

1330
01:26:24,846 --> 01:26:27,076
Well, somebody looks
mighty happy tonight.

1331
01:26:27,148 --> 01:26:31,278
Yes, I passed my examinations
at school today.

1332
01:26:31,353 --> 01:26:34,186
Did you?
You are a smart girl.

1333
01:26:34,256 --> 01:26:36,986
They told me I'll be ready
to take a job in about three months.

1334
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:41,552
Lotta, how would you like
to go to Chicago to work?

1335
01:26:42,998 --> 01:26:45,057
Pa would hate it in Chicago.

1336
01:26:45,133 --> 01:26:47,897
Karie wouldn’t like it either,
I don't think.

1337
01:26:47,969 --> 01:26:49,596
I wasn't thinking of them.

1338
01:26:50,505 --> 01:26:51,972
I mean you.

1339
01:26:52,674 --> 01:26:53,834
Alone?

1340
01:26:55,477 --> 01:26:57,502
I'd be lonesome.

1341
01:26:57,579 --> 01:26:59,911
I'd be scared to be
in Chicago alone.

1342
01:26:59,981 --> 01:27:01,573
I'd be there.

1343
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:04,913
I mean, I'd come down often
on business trips.

1344
01:27:04,986 --> 01:27:08,922
We could go
to the theater together, have dinner.

1345
01:27:08,990 --> 01:27:10,855
You’d like that, wouldn’t you?

1346
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:16,194
Yes, but you being
a married man and all,

1347
01:27:16,264 --> 01:27:18,129
people would think
it was funny.

1348
01:27:19,301 --> 01:27:20,893
People wouldn’t know.

1349
01:27:26,675 --> 01:27:30,042
- I guess you don't think much of me if...
- Lotta, darling, I love you.

1350
01:27:30,111 --> 01:27:32,909
No, you don't, Mr. Glasgow.
Don't talk like that.

1351
01:27:32,981 --> 01:27:34,846
You think just because
I'm a young girl...

1352
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:37,077
Do you think that I'm old, Lotta?
Because I'm not.

1353
01:27:37,152 --> 01:27:39,416
- I love you. I'll do anything for you.
- You mustn’t.

1354
01:27:39,487 --> 01:27:42,047
You must have known how I felt
about you the moment I first saw you.

1355
01:27:42,123 --> 01:27:43,147
No.

1356
01:27:44,059 --> 01:27:46,118
I thought it was
on account of my father.

1357
01:27:47,462 --> 01:27:49,396
Well, anyway, I did at first.

1358
01:27:49,464 --> 01:27:50,954
It was you, Lotta.

1359
01:27:51,032 --> 01:27:54,866
You’re what I've missed all my life.
I need you. I've got to have you.

1360
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:57,700
I made a mistake once,
but now it's going to be different.

1361
01:27:57,772 --> 01:28:00,002
- Lotta, you and l...
- Don't, Mr. Glasgow.

1362
01:28:00,075 --> 01:28:02,009
You mustn’t say these things.
It's wrong.

1363
01:28:02,077 --> 01:28:06,207
You mean because I'm married?
I'll get a divorce if you'll only wait.

1364
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:08,215
I'll take you away from here.
I'll make you happy.

1365
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:09,648
I'll do anything that l...

1366
01:28:10,352 --> 01:28:12,411
I'll see you tomorrow night
at the annual party.

1367
01:28:12,487 --> 01:28:13,749
We'll talk about it then.

1368
01:28:14,422 --> 01:28:17,858
Well, I'm glad we didn't
eat them all up.

1369
01:28:18,727 --> 01:28:21,423
- Thank you.
- They're the best I've ever made.

1370
01:28:46,688 --> 01:28:49,088
- Glad to see you.
- Glad to see you. How are you doing?

1371
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:51,091
Captain of the baseball team.

1372
01:28:51,893 --> 01:28:53,793
- Hello, Barney.
- Hello, George. How are you?

1373
01:28:53,862 --> 01:28:55,329
How do you do?
Good to see you.

1374
01:28:55,397 --> 01:28:56,659
- How are you?
- Good evening.

1375
01:28:56,731 --> 01:28:57,925
How are you?

1376
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:02,462
- How are you doing?
- How do you do?

1377
01:29:02,537 --> 01:29:05,802
Hello, Charlie.
How are you, Mrs. Schultz?

1378
01:29:05,874 --> 01:29:07,739
Who are you looking for, Richard?

1379
01:29:07,809 --> 01:29:09,709
Oh, just looking.

1380
01:29:13,915 --> 01:29:15,439
Hello. How are you?

1381
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:31,783
How do you do, Mrs. Bolger?
Hello, Bert. Glad to see you.

1382
01:30:31,860 --> 01:30:33,157
Well, hello, Schwerke.

1383
01:30:33,228 --> 01:30:35,560
Good evening, Mr. Glasgow.
This is my mother and father.

1384
01:30:35,630 --> 01:30:37,825
- How do you do?
- Fine, thank you, Mr. Glasgow.

1385
01:30:37,899 --> 01:30:39,332
How are you, sir?

1386
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:41,095
This is Mrs. Glasgow.
Mr. and Mrs. Schwerke.

1387
01:30:41,169 --> 01:30:43,399
- How do you do?
- Well, thank you, Mrs. Glasgow.

1388
01:30:43,471 --> 01:30:45,701
- I'm glad to see you.
- Glad to see you, Mrs. Glasgow.

1389
01:30:45,774 --> 01:30:48,402
You know Richard, of course.
And this is Tony Schwerke.

1390
01:30:48,476 --> 01:30:50,307
Yes, I guessed as much.

1391
01:30:50,378 --> 01:30:52,903
You've got a paper cup
and my daughter wants to marry you.

1392
01:30:52,981 --> 01:30:55,950
I don't want to marry him just because
he has a paper cup, Mother.

1393
01:30:57,385 --> 01:30:59,751
Have you had anything to drink yet?
Well, you have something.

1394
01:30:59,821 --> 01:31:00,845
George, come here a minute.

1395
01:31:00,922 --> 01:31:02,446
Come, Schwerke,
have some for yourself.

1396
01:31:02,524 --> 01:31:05,152
The more I think about that paper cup
of yours, the better I like it.

1397
01:31:20,141 --> 01:31:21,301
Hello.

1398
01:31:21,376 --> 01:31:22,707
- Hello.
- Hello, Richard.

1399
01:31:23,511 --> 01:31:24,739
Oh, hello.

1400
01:31:26,314 --> 01:31:28,077
The family's waiting up there.

1401
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:29,343
<i>Oh, ja.</i>

1402
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:42,724
Now, about free silver...

1403
01:31:42,797 --> 01:31:44,924
- Hey, Barney.
- Hello, Swan! How are you?

1404
01:31:44,999 --> 01:31:46,967
Hello, Mr. Glasgow.
This is wonderful.

1405
01:31:47,035 --> 01:31:48,866
Where's Lotta?
Did you bring her?

1406
01:31:48,937 --> 01:31:51,235
She just went over there
with Richard.

1407
01:31:51,306 --> 01:31:53,399
By George, Barney,
this nice party.

1408
01:31:53,474 --> 01:31:57,808
Yes. Will you excuse me a minute?
Get yourself a drink, won't you?

1409
01:32:12,861 --> 01:32:15,625
Hello, Josie.
Are you having a good time?

1410
01:32:15,697 --> 01:32:16,857
Lovely.

1411
01:32:17,432 --> 01:32:18,990
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

1412
01:32:28,676 --> 01:32:30,371
Well, here we are.

1413
01:32:32,313 --> 01:32:35,612
You were so late coming,
I was about to go after you.

1414
01:32:36,217 --> 01:32:38,845
- I almost didn't come.
- Why?

1415
01:32:40,355 --> 01:32:44,485
- Well, I'm not an employee of the mill.
- I know, but Karie and Swan are.

1416
01:32:45,393 --> 01:32:46,553
Thank you.

1417
01:32:48,296 --> 01:32:51,788
Richard, Pa and Karie and I
are going back to Iron Ridge.

1418
01:32:53,801 --> 01:32:56,736
- You don't like it here?
- We love it, but...

1419
01:32:56,804 --> 01:32:57,964
But what?

1420
01:33:00,475 --> 01:33:03,808
It wasn't because of anything I said
the other night, was it?

1421
01:33:03,878 --> 01:33:06,574
- No.
- I was an awful sap.

1422
01:33:06,648 --> 01:33:07,706
Yes.

1423
01:33:08,983 --> 01:33:10,177
Yes.

1424
01:33:10,752 --> 01:33:13,653
You know, I'm kind of glad
it happened, though.

1425
01:33:13,721 --> 01:33:14,710
Why?

1426
01:33:14,789 --> 01:33:17,917
Because it made you so mad
that you had to take notice of me.

1427
01:33:19,127 --> 01:33:22,324
- I noticed you before that.
- Did you?

1428
01:33:23,698 --> 01:33:27,361
And what's all this guff
about going back to Iron Ridge?

1429
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:29,335
- I've got to go.
- But why?

1430
01:33:30,371 --> 01:33:33,169
- Well, because...
- Because why?

1431
01:33:35,276 --> 01:33:39,645
Because Pa misses the woods.
He's used to an outdoor life...

1432
01:33:39,714 --> 01:33:41,545
hunting and fishing.

1433
01:33:41,616 --> 01:33:43,106
Well, you’re not going.

1434
01:33:44,786 --> 01:33:48,085
- You don't belong up there.
- I don't know where I belong.

1435
01:33:48,156 --> 01:33:50,886
Well, I'll tell you.
You belong with me.

1436
01:33:50,959 --> 01:33:53,655
I'm going to New York to live,
and you're coming with me.

1437
01:33:53,728 --> 01:33:54,752
We'll crash New York together,

1438
01:33:54,829 --> 01:33:57,127
just a couple of rubes
from the Middle West.

1439
01:33:57,198 --> 01:34:00,998
Mr. and Mrs. Richard Glasgow
have taken an apartment at the Waldorf.

1440
01:34:09,777 --> 01:34:12,109
- Can I help you, Mr. Glasgow?
- No, thank you.

1441
01:35:15,576 --> 01:35:18,101
- Come out of there.
- Now wait a minute, Father.

1442
01:35:26,421 --> 01:35:28,321
Come on and fight,

1443
01:35:28,389 --> 01:35:31,017
because I'm going to lick
the everlasting daylights out of you!

1444
01:35:36,864 --> 01:35:39,264
Father, you crazy?
You out of your mind?

1445
01:35:39,333 --> 01:35:41,460
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!

1446
01:35:41,536 --> 01:35:43,970
I'm in love with Lotta
and she's in love with me.

1447
01:35:44,038 --> 01:35:46,802
We're going to be married,
and there's nothing you can do about it.

1448
01:35:48,576 --> 01:35:50,168
Don't, Richard. Don't!

1449
01:35:50,244 --> 01:35:52,576
He's your father.
He's an old man.

1450
01:35:58,786 --> 01:36:00,276
Get out of here.

1451
01:36:02,023 --> 01:36:03,251
Both of you.

1452
01:36:04,559 --> 01:36:05,617
Come on, Lotta.

1453
01:36:18,072 --> 01:36:19,437
Bernard!

1454
01:36:34,288 --> 01:36:35,482
Bernard!

1455
01:36:40,128 --> 01:36:41,755
There you are.
I've been looking...

1456
01:36:43,464 --> 01:36:45,125
What's the matter?

1457
01:36:47,502 --> 01:36:48,799
What is it?

1458
01:36:52,273 --> 01:36:53,467
What's the matter?

1459
01:36:54,275 --> 01:36:56,800
- That precious son of yours.
- What...

1460
01:36:57,745 --> 01:37:00,737
- I threw him out of the house.
- Why?

1461
01:37:00,815 --> 01:37:03,079
He's going to marry that girl.

1462
01:37:03,951 --> 01:37:05,350
Is that all?

1463
01:37:06,587 --> 01:37:08,054
Is that all?

1464
01:37:09,790 --> 01:37:11,018
You don't care?

1465
01:37:11,092 --> 01:37:13,890
No, as long as it isn't you.

1466
01:37:14,996 --> 01:37:17,931
I thought it was you, maybe.

1467
01:37:20,301 --> 01:37:23,464
But then, perhaps even you
can’t have everything you want.

1468
01:37:28,409 --> 01:37:30,775
There. You look better now.

1469
01:37:32,480 --> 01:37:35,472
The tables are all ready,
but they won't sit down.

1470
01:37:35,550 --> 01:37:37,745
See if you can get them
to come in and eat.

1471
01:37:56,204 --> 01:37:57,262
Barney!

1472
01:38:04,245 --> 01:38:06,611
Barney, what's the matter with you?

1473
01:38:08,916 --> 01:38:10,076
Nothing.

1474
01:38:11,052 --> 01:38:12,781
Nothing's the matter, Swan.

1475
01:38:15,823 --> 01:38:17,654
I'm an old man, Swan.

1476
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:20,291
An old fool.

1477
01:38:26,968 --> 01:38:30,165
Come and get it!
Come and get it!

1478
01:38:30,238 --> 01:38:35,107
Come and get it,
or we'll throw it to the dogs!

1479
01:38:35,176 --> 01:38:37,770
Come and get it!

1480
01:38:43,651 --> 01:38:46,814
Come and get it,
or we'll throw it to the dogs!

1481
01:38:46,887 --> 01:38:48,718
Come and get it!
