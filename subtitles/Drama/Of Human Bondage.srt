1
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,400
KNOCKSArretez au coin, s'il vous plait.

2
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,900
Monsieur Foine. Yes, monsieur?

3
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,500
Could I speak to you for a moment?

4
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:18,200
Well, I've been studying painting
with you for some time now.

5
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,400
Do you think it's worth my whileWhy do you ask?

6
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,600
There's no sense in staying
unless I have talent.

7
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,900
If you are not certain about
your talent, why stay till now?

8
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,000
Because all this
is so beautiful to me.

9
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,300
In my youth,
it was also beautiful to me.

10
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,500
But now,
it is the city of lost illusions.

11
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,500
Is your studio very far?
No. Not very.

12
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,800
Let us go there. You will show me
what you have done. Yes.

13
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,200
Have you any money?A little. Not enough to live on.

14
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,400
Then, I must tell you.

15
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:14,800
There is no talent here, merely
industry and intelligence. You will
never be anything but mediocre.

16
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:21,800
And it is very cruel
to discover one's mediocrity only
when it is too late. I know.

17
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,400
That name does not belong there.

18
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,800
It belongs somewhere else.

19
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:35,200
Take your courage in both your hands
and make something of your life.

20
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,400
Have you anything in mind?
Well, you see...

21
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:53,300
..I have my limitations. I've always
been interested in medicine.

22
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:58,300
If one can't be great, at least
one can be of some use to people.

23
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,900
WOMAN COUGHS

24
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,700
I don't know why I should 'ave such
a thing. Upon my word, I don't!

25
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,400
I've never had a day's illness
in my life.

26
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,300
It's a winter cough.
Many middle-aged women have it.

27
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:03,100
Well, I never! No-one's
ever called me middle-aged before.
It's time you got used to it.

28
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,000
All the same.
You're a nice one, deerie.

29
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,200
I can't say the same for you.
Good day, madam.

30
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:13,100
The rest of you come back tomorrow.
Get him ready.

31
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,100
All right, sir.

32
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,300
Are you the boy's father? Yes, sir.

33
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,800
What's the matter with you now?

34
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,000
You see what the matter is.
The boy has a club foot.

35
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,200
Carey, you'd better take this case.

36
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,100
It's a subject
you ought to know something about.

37
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,400
It's only for the looks of the
thing. I don't find it no trouble.

38
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,800
That's wonderful. I did. That's cos
you let them go on at you.

39
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,600
You're a little slow, Carey.
I'll instruct the class.

40
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,600
There are many varieties of
club feet. This is less interesting.

41
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,700
Yours would prove more interesting.Yes. I believe so.

42
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,500
Mind taking off your sock, Carey?

43
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,000
No. Not at all.

44
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,200
Keeps his feet nice and clean,
doesn't he?

45
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,900
Hm, yes. Talipes equinovarus -
malformation requiring you to walk
on the outside of the foot.

46
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,200
A very interesting example,
I must say!

47
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,600
Do you mind if I have a look?

48
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,700
Congenital club foot.

49
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:57,300
In simple language, a foot twisted
inward. The cause is not clear.

50
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,700
Hereditary influence plays a part.

51
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:03,800
Dr Little traces recurring deformity
through four generations.

52
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,100
When you've quite finished...

53
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:15,800
I say, old man, I like that!
French, isn't she?
Yes. She was a model in Paris.

54
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,100
I can't, for the life of me,
understand why you gave up painting.

55
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:25,200
I'd rather look at that all day
long, than at this! Woman, you know!

56
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,200
You can tell by the, er, pelvis.I like 'em with a little more...

57
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,500
LAUGHTER
There's life in the old girl yet!

58
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,500
Don't inhale, deerie!

59
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,600
I say! I've got to be getting along!

60
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:46,800
A little matter of a barmaid
at the Crown & Anchor.
Very nice, too! Cheerie-o!

61
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,800
Funny fellow, isn't he?

62
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,400
It must have been wonderfulIt was.

63
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,000
You really knew all thoseSome of them.

64
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,900
I wonder if you couldn't help me.In what way?

65
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,700
There's a girl
and I can't get anywhere with her.

66
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:10,400
You've been to Paris and all that.
I'm sure you can give me a starter.

67
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,300
I'd ask Griffiths, only he couldn't
remember whom he was doing it for.

68
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,800
You know,
say something to make her laugh.

69
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,100
LAUGHS

70
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,400
MAN: What? You don't believe it?
You are too suspicious!

71
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:41,100
I say, she's marvellous, isn't she?No. She's anaemic.

72
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,300
You don't suppose she likesOf course.

73
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,200
Now's your chance. Say something.

74
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,500
Well, I see your friend's going.

75
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,900
I don't know what you mean.

76
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,400
The nobleman
with the sandy moustache.

77
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,400
Has he left you for another?

78
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,000
Some people would do better
to mind their own business.

79
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,300
Why?

80
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,500
You have a very nice back. Am I
on speaking terms with your back?

81
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,700
Woman, you know.
You can tell by the pelvis.

82
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:35,700
And that...calls himself
a gentleman!

83
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,300
I apologise. What for?I promised you something charming.

84
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:44,000
She's turned out
to be ill-natured and contemptible.

85
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You don't suppose I care what
an anaemic waitress says to me?

86
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Well, I do. I must be going.

87
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,900
Coming along?

88
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,200
No, I think I'll have some more tea.

89
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,100
Anything you want?Yes, if you don't mind.

90
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,500
I'd like to talk to you.
Filthy weather, isn't it?

91
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,800
Makes no difference to me.
I have to be here all day.

92
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,700
Oh, I only wanted to sayWell, say it.

93
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:48,600
You know, you have a lovely smile.
You should use it more often.

94
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,800
Now, don't go spoofing me.

95
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:56,100
A girl that works hard all day
don't have much reason to smile.

96
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,000
Perhaps I could find a reason.
Will you let me try?

97
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,300
I don't know whether I will
or whether I won't.

98
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,700
I hope you'll decide you will.

99
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,000
Huh!

100
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,800
RAIN FALLS

101
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,800
KLAXON BLARES

102
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:20,000
Like that, unt that, like so!

103
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,500
BOTH LAUGH

104
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,100
That is a nice little hand.

105
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
GLASS CHIMES

106
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,400
Excuse me, won't you? Ja ja.

107
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,800
THEY GIGGLE

108
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,500
How do you do?You seem in a great hurry.

109
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,900
I've been waiting ten minutes.

110
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,900
I didn't know you could draw!Didn't you?

111
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:20,000
That meant to be me? Looks like you.

112
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,900
If you look at it that way. Tea?

113
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,900
You are a strange sort.

114
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,500
I say, will you dine with me
some time? We'll go to the theatre?

115
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,600
I don't mind. When will you come?

116
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm off Thursdays.All right, Thursday,
seven o'clock Victoria Station?

117
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
RINGING

118
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:51,600
All right. I'll meet you at Victoria
in the second class waiting room.

119
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,400
All tickets, please!

120
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,600
Show your tickets.

121
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,700
All tickets, please!

122
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,300
STEAM ENGINE FIRES UP

123
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,500
All tickets, please!

124
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,500
Show your tickets.
All tickets, please!

125
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,100
Boat train, platform 19!

126
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,400
All tickets, please...!

127
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,700
I thought you were never coming.I like that!

128
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,100
After keeping ME waiting.
I almost went home.

129
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,700
I was in the second class
waiting room.

130
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:02,800
Is it likely I'd sit in the second
class when I could sit in the first?

131
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,500
For a gentleman of brains,
you don't use 'em!

132
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,500
Perhaps not. Anyway, you're here,
so it's all right, isn't it?

133
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,900
You certainly do make a girl
feel important.

134
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,600
VIOLINS PLAY

135
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,700
I love that music.

136
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,000
Whenever I hear it, I think of you.

137
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,800
How pale you are.

138
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,600
How strange, how cold.

139
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,500
CORK POPS

140
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:39,000
You ARE going it!
Do you always order champagne?

141
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,300
No. Why did you do it now?

142
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,900
I was hoping it would make you
more friendly.

143
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:57,600
Do you think it will? Well,
there's one thing I can say for you.

144
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,900
Gentleman,
in every sense of the word.

145
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,800
May I see you again?

146
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,600
I don't mind. Doesn't it make
any difference to you?

147
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,400
No. If you don't take me out,
someone else will.

148
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,600
I'll say good night here.

149
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,000
Won't you stay for a moment? No.Why not?

150
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,100
People would think
I don't know what.

151
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,300
I love that music.

152
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,600
Whenever I hear it, I think of you.

153
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,600
Whenever I hear it, I think of us.

154
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,900
I've never danced with anyone
who danced like you.

155
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:01,600
I've been looking for you
all my life.

156
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:24,600
You don't have much to do with
your time. I should be studying.

157
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,200
Then why don't you?Well, I'd rather see you.

158
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,300
Any of the girls noticeI don't know.

159
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:36,800
What difference does it make?
They all laugh at you. Do they?

160
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,300
Why? Say you're in love with me.

161
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,300
SHE LAUGHS

162
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,800
May I call you Mildred?

163
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,700
I don't mind.

164
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,300
Look here, don't say that any more,
will you? Why not?

165
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:58,700
Well, I'll call you Mildred
and you call me Philip, will you?

166
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,200
I'll think on it.

167
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:07,900
I, um...I'm a little awkward at this
but will you kiss me good night?

168
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,600
No.

169
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,600
Oh, Mildred. Will you come
to the theatre with me on Saturday?

170
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,500
I don't mind.

171
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,800
You're sure they're for Saturday?Certainly.

172
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:51,400
My name is Miller, Emile Miller.
We should know each other.

173
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:56,400
Why? Well, we are both interestedThing?

174
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,800
My dear young man, you are so...
so... er...

175
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,800
artistic.

176
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,100
You, you should be more...

177
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,900
Like so!

178
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,200
Thanks. Thanks very much.

179
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,100
That's all right.

180
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,300
Keep the change.

181
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,600
What time shall I see you?

182
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:25,100
I forgot to tell you, Philip.
I can't go. W... Why not?

183
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,200
Me aunt's ill.

184
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,400
Oh.

185
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,800
Well!

186
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,500
What's the sense in that? You don't
suppose I want to go by myself?

187
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,700
I only got them for your sake.Well you needn't go on about it.

188
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,900
WOMAN: Violets! Sweet violets!

189
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,600
Sweet violets, tuppence a bunch.

190
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,300
Violets! Sweet violets...

191
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,600
You're spying on me.

192
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,100
I thought you was a gentleman,
in every sense of the word.

193
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,400
Are you going out with Miller? No.

194
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,800
Well, what if I am? I can go out
with him if I want to, can't I?

195
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,500
He's keeping you waiting, isn't he?

196
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:31,100
I'd rather wait for him
than have you waiting for me.

197
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,900
Won't you change your mind?

198
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,600
I'll get some more tickets... No.

199
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,300
You keep looking for him
the way I look for you.

200
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,700
If you don't come out with me
tonight you'll never see me again.

201
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,400
Good riddance to bad rubbish.

202
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:09,500
PIANO, LAUGHTER, VOICES

203
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,800
Oh, drink?

204
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,800
Desire?

205
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,000
PIANO PLAYS JOLLY TUNE, LAUGHTER

206
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,100
WOMAN'S LAUGHTER

207
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,100
CLEARS THROAT

208
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Sorry, old boy.

209
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,400
How about a nice large beer, huh?

210
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,000
Wouldn't help? What would?

211
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,300
Oh, Phil. Leave it.

212
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:39,800
Why? What for?Shows the waiter who you are.

213
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,900
He knows who YOU are.

214
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,700
And so do I. What do you mean?

215
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,500
I'm sorry. I...didn't mean.

216
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:57,600
You're a bit too superior for me,
my fine young friend.

217
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,700
Mildred!

218
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,600
Of course you don't like me.
I'm a cripple.

219
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,100
No, Phil. It isn't that.I've felt it all along.

220
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,100
Foolish.

221
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,800
Mind my hat, silly!

222
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,100
You ARE clumsy!

223
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,700
WHISTLES A TUNE

224
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,400
Off your nut! What practice can you
expect with a wife like that?

225
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:53,100
I don't know. Let me ask you.
Why do you want to marry this girl?

226
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,700
Because I'm so in love with her.Aah!

227
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,900
That ring with a little design
is very popular, sir.

228
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:13,300
We sell a great many of them.
They're 30 shillings.

229
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,300
Thank you, sir.

230
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:21,400
Philip, were you surprised when
I asked you to take me to dinner?

231
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:25,700
I was delighted.Were you? Yeah. Why?

232
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:30,500
You've been so sweet to me all day
and I've got something to ask you.

233
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:34,800
It makes it so much easier for me.Makes it easier for me, too.

234
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,900
I've something to tell you.No, no. Let me tell you first.

235
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,900
There it is.

236
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,800
I want you to marry me.

237
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:51,100
I'm so sorry, Philip.
That's what I was about to tell you.

238
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,800
You shouldn't have waited so long.

239
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:58,100
The fact is,
I'm going to be married.

240
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:03,000
Are you?

241
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,600
To whom?

242
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,700
A man I know.

243
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,700
He earns very good money.

244
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,500
Yes, I'm...I'm sure of it.

245
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,500
Now, you won't go on about it,
will you, Philip?

246
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,800
All right.

247
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:23,000
I'm getting on.
I'm 24. Time I settled down.

248
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,200
This gentleman earns £7 a week.
He's got good prospects.

249
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,000
Well, this is goodbye.
I hate to eat and run, Philip.

250
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,400
I'm going to the theatre with the
gentleman that I'm going to marry.

251
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,200
MAN: All the latest films
of the day...!

252
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,900
Taxi.

253
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,200
Have you seen her since?

254
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:27,500
No. London is the largest city
in the world and you know the cure
for ONE woman.

255
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,000
Another. Ha ha! Right, ho!

256
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,200
Norah, you don't read such junk,
do you?

257
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,800
No. I write it. What?

258
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,400
That's how I earn my living.
I didn't know.

259
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:56,600
Successful? Very. I have an immense
popularity amongst kitchen maids.

260
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:59,400
They think me so refined.

261
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,000
Let's not talk about that.

262
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,200
Let's talk about us.

263
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:24,600
Norah, y-you're not really
fond of me, are you?

264
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:29,900
For a clever boy,
you ask such foolish questions.

265
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:34,000
Oh, my dear. It never struck mePleased?

266
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,200
Delighted. And so proud
and so happy and so...

267
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,700
So grateful.

268
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:44,200
I wish you hadn't been in love
with... What was her name?

269
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,300
Mildred.

270
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:50,000
Because if she hadn't treated you
so abominably

271
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,800
it wouldn't have taken you so long
to understand how I feel.

272
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,700
I saw you! I wasn't very quick!

273
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,900
Let's go out and play.

274
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,800
Not until you've passed that exam.

275
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:56,100
Tell me, darling.
What do you get out of this?

276
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:59,000
You'll never know.

277
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,900
I'm afraid you don't get much fun
with me.

278
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,000
I wish...

279
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,000
If only I could take you dancing.
I know how you love it.

280
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,300
Philip, it's very silly to be
so sensitive about your foot.

281
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:18,000
Other people don't think about it
as much as you.

282
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,600
They notice it when they first
see you then forget about it.

283
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:28,200
You know, I only speak of it
because I love you.

284
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,100
I don't want it to make you unhappy.

285
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:36,400
Now, will you please stay here
and go on cramming for that exam?

286
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,800
There's a lady to see you, sir.

287
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,800
I shouldn't have let her in
but she was that upset...

288
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,800
Norah!

289
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,800
What do you want?

290
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:13,400
I didn't think
I'd ever see you again.

291
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,800
What's the matter?

292
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:26,400
He's left me. Emile.

293
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,900
Oh, has he?

294
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,700
Yes.

295
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,600
Cos I'm going to have a baby.

296
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,200
Why don't you sit down?

297
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,400
I suppose you want him back.He'll never come back.

298
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:12,400
Why not? He just won't, that's all.

299
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,900
You're his wife.
He has to provide for you.

300
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,000
He won't give me anything.

301
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,100
Even if he did, I wouldn't take it.Why not?

302
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,900
No matter what's happened,
I've got me pride.

303
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,400
That's something, isn't it(?)

304
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,500
Have you got any money?

305
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,700
No.

306
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:45,500
You'd better get yourself
a place to live.

307
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:48,600
After that,
we'll see what can be done.

308
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:53,500
Philip, you were always so good
to me. I knew I could come to you.

309
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:05,600
Look here, Mr Miller.I?

310
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,500
What you expect me to do?Take care of her. You married her.

311
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,800
I? I married Mildred? Ach!

312
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,800
I married...

313
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,700
This one.

314
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,600
I'd still like to know
what you intend to do.

315
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,400
Me? I can do nothing.

316
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:35,000
One man cannot solution the problem
of the unmarried mother.

317
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,900
Why didn't you tell me?

318
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
I just couldn't.

319
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,800
Well, brace up.

320
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,200
Everything will be all right.

321
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,100
Philip...

322
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Do you still...like me?

323
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Really?

324
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,500
Strange as it may seem,
I always have.

325
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,900
I suppose I always shall.

326
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:35,400
I did everything I could
to make you love me.

327
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,900
I thought you were incapable
of loving anybody.

328
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:44,700
It's horrible to think
that you were willing to sacrifice
everything for that man.

329
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,800
I'm awfully sorry, Philip.

330
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:51,300
I shall never forget
you wanted to marry me.

331
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,600
Philip? Yes?

332
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,000
You've been so nice to me...

333
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,800
..I'll do anything you want.

334
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,600
Will you? Why?

335
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,000
Why, I owe it to you.

336
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,300
Oh. Do you?

337
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,500
You're not angry.

338
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,200
No.

339
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:44,700
Then you'll stay and haveYes, if you want me to.

340
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,900
Of course, Philip.
Nothing could delight me more.

341
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:53,400
Just a moment
and I'll have everything ready.

342
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,800
KNOCK ON DOOR

343
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,900
Come in.

344
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,800
Hello, darling.

345
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,900
Norah!

346
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,600
How did you happen to come?

347
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,000
Just passing by.

348
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,500
I wanted to rub my nose
against your door.

349
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:55,200
Philip,
why haven't I heard from you?

350
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,600
I was just going to write.

351
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,400
Why haven't you come to see me?

352
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,800
Well, I...I've been busy.

353
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:07,100
Why so silent?

354
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,100
Well, you see...

355
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:15,500
Norah, I've got something strange
to tell you.

356
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:19,800
You've been so good to me,
it only makes it harder.

357
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,900
Philip, what's wrong?

358
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,600
I'm sorry. It's just over.

359
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,100
You mean you don't care for me
any more?

360
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:32,500
I'm afraid so. What have I done?

361
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,700
Nothing.
You've been wonderful to me.

362
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,800
It's just that I...

363
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:45,800
Of course, I knew you never loved me
as much as I loved you.

364
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,100
Yes, I'm afraid
that's usually the case.

365
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,900
There's usually one who loves
and one who is loved.

366
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:55,900
Oh, it's always the same.

367
00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:00,600
You want a man to be nice to you,
you have to be rotten to him.

368
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,600
If you treat a man honestly, you...

369
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:11,300
Philip, there's someone else.

370
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,400
Yes.

371
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,700
Who is she?

372
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,700
Mildred.

373
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,600
She's come back.

374
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,200
After all she's done.

375
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,800
How could you?

376
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,500
That's what I'd like to know.

377
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:36,800
It's just as though
you're bound to her in some way.

378
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,800
Yes.

379
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,900
As I am to you.

380
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,300
And she was to Miller.

381
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:48,800
As every human being is
to something or other.

382
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:07,000
Funny looking little thing,
isn't it? I can't believe it's mine.

383
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,500
Now, if you'll excuse me.

384
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,000
So glad it's over, darling.

385
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,800
You've been so good to me, Philip.

386
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,900
From now on,
things will be different.

387
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:34,500
Now, you will take good care of her,
won't you?

388
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,800
That I will, ma'am.

389
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,300
Good day. Good day.

390
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:48,200
I know you don't like it, Philip.

391
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:53,200
I can't do anything elseI suppose not.

392
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:58,000
Be sure and go over on Sundays
and see the baby's taken care of.

393
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,100
I will.

394
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,800
What are we going to do
this afternoon?

395
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,200
I asked Griffiths to come over.

396
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,600
Oh, did you?

397
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:16,000
Why? I know you find him amusing
and I'm always afraid of boring you.

398
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,800
Hello, hello, hello.

399
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,300
Sorry I'm late.
Had to get rid of a girl.

400
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:33,200
Why didn't you bring her?I'm not interested in MY girl.

401
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:37,400
I'm interested in other men's girls.
D'you like me?

402
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,500
LAUGHS

403
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:47,900
Really, I'm too hungry to know.
I think I like you lots.

404
00:44:47,900 --> 00:44:53,100
I'd like you more if he took us out
to dinner. I'd tell you stories.

405
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:57,300
You'll have a wonderful time.
What would he do?

406
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,500
Ooh, pay the bill.

407
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,600
BOTH LAUGH

408
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:09,900
GRIFFITHS AND MILDRED LAUGH

409
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:16,400
I said, "What's that? Your missus?
I thought it was your sister!"

410
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,900
Oh, allez-up!

411
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:31,000
Allez-up!

412
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,600
"Thought it was your sister!"

413
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:45,300
POLITELY: Good night, Philip.

414
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,000
FLIRTATIOUSLY: Good night.

415
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,300
Just a moment.

416
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,700
Are you in love with Mildred?

417
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:06,200
I?
LAUGHS

418
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:10,100
That's what you've been
so funny about! My dear old boy...

419
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:15,400
Look here. It doesn't matter to you,
Harry. You've got so many women.

420
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:19,400
Don't take Mildred away from me.My dear old boy!

421
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:23,300
She's nothing to me at all!
Nothing at all!

422
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:25,400
CHUCKLES

423
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:41,700
Do you like it, Philip? Very much.

424
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:44,800
So nice of you to give it to me.

425
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:54,100
What are you thinking about?

426
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:59,400
You were having quite a flirtationI was.

427
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:04,300
Matter of fact, well...
I'm sort of in love with him.

428
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:06,300
I'm not surprised!

429
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:11,600
What do you mean? He's good looking,
says the things that make you laugh.

430
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:16,700
I'll thank you not to make funI wasn't making fun of you.

431
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:20,300
You don't act as if it's serious.
I don't think it is. Why not?

432
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:25,100
Griffiths isn't in love with you.
How do you know? I asked him.

433
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,600
Would you like to read a letter
I got from him this morning?

434
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,900
"I've been up all night
thinking about you.

435
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:45,500
"I have just sent for a messenger
to take this to you in the dawn.

436
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:50,600
"You've no notion of the time
I had with your friend last night.

437
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:55,700
"He kept asking me if I love you
and of course what could I say?

438
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:58,000
"He'll doubtless tell you all this,

439
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,800
"so I'm making sure that you..."

440
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,900
Well?
Can't help it if I love him, can I?

441
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:16,300
No. I suppose not. Then whatNothing.

442
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:21,000
Only I was fool enough to thinkI do, Philip.

443
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
As a friend.

444
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,200
Not in any other way.

445
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:29,600
But you do care for Griffiths
in the other way.

446
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:35,900
But you're cold. That sort of thing
doesn't mean anything to you.

447
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:40,300
That's what YOU think.

448
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:52,300
It's no use going on about it,
Philip.

449
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:57,600
You said yourself that I couldn't
help it if I'm in love with him.

450
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:05,200
If there's anything else to be said,
say it.

451
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,500
That's a nice dress you have on,
Mildred.

452
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:13,800
I couldn't afford it,
but I paid for it.

453
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:17,400
You have a nice apartment.
I couldn't afford it but I...

454
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,000
If you were a gentleman, would you
throw what you've done in my face?

455
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,100
Do you think it matters to me
whether I'm a gentleman or not?

456
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:28,000
If I were, you don't suppose
I'd care for a cheap vulgar...

457
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:33,000
I'm sorry, Philip.
I didn't want to end this way.

458
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:41,900
Harry's waiting for me.What do you intend to do?

459
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:44,800
We're going to Paris.

460
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:46,900
Get out.

461
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,500
Get out!

462
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,600
RIPPING

463
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,500
SOBBING

464
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:44,100
I've moved three times and each time
this woman's hounded me down.

465
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:46,600
I don't like to do this but...

466
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,100
All right, sir. I'll move her on.

467
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:53,000
Come on, young lady.
You can't stay here. Come on, now.

468
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:57,900
SOBBING

469
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:22,200
Look here, Carey. Mildred and I
are all washed up... Too bad.

470
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:24,300
BELL RINGS

471
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:27,200
Excuse me. I'm due in the ward.

472
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:49,800
Anything interesting, Carey?
What an unusual name you have.

473
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:54,400
An old Yorkshire name. Once took
a day's riding across our estates.

474
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,000
And here I am in a charity hospital

475
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,000
because my father loved fast women
and slow horses.

476
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,600
How the mighty are fallen!

477
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:08,400
Hello! Hello, Father.

478
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:16,900
Carey, this is my daughter,
christened Maria del Sol.

479
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:21,000
Her mother called her Sally.
This young man is a student here.

480
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,400
He's been nice to me. With some
inducement, he might be nice to YOU.

481
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:30,300
Now, Father. Father's particular
genius is saying the wrong thing.

482
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,900
He thinks it's fun to embarrass me.

483
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:36,400
It is. Try it some time, Carey.
ALTHERNY CHUCKLES

484
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:39,800
I will, if I get the chance.You shall have it!

485
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:43,400
You're coming to see us
the first Sunday I am home.

486
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:46,500
Oh, yes. Please do.ALTHERNY CHUCKLES

487
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,600
CHILDREN CHATTER AND LAUGH

488
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,000
KNIFE SHARPENING

489
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:13,100
What a quaint house!

490
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:18,600
Yes, but it's not very sanitary.Sanitation be hanged! Give me art!

491
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:22,700
I've got nine children
and they thrive on bad drains.

492
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:26,400
Look at that, now.I am, with great admiration.

493
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,400
Shall I bring the ale, Father?

494
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:34,500
Right, m'girl.
The sooner the better.

495
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:38,200
I hope you didn't have the table
here on my account.

496
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:41,100
I'd be happy to have dinner
with the children.

497
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:45,400
Oh, no. I take meals by myself.
I like these antique customs.

498
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:49,500
I don't think women ought
to sit down at table with men.

499
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:52,500
CHUCKLING: Why not?It ruins conversation.

500
00:53:54,600 --> 00:54:00,900
It's bad for them. Puts ideas
in their heads! Women are never
at ease when they have ideas.

501
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:04,900
You sound like the voiceI am, sir.

502
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:09,200
This fine Yorkshire pudding
gives me strength to carry on.

503
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,900
Stop getting up and down
every time she comes in.

504
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:15,700
She doesn't want you to make a fuss.

505
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:22,700
She won't think it rude if
you sit still. She don't care a hang
for chivalry, do you, Sally?

506
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:24,400
No, Father.

507
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:29,000
You speak quietly while eyeing
the young man so boldly.

508
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,500
Yes, Father.

509
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:36,400
You know what I'm talking about?
How could I, darling?

510
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,500
You're so clever.

511
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:42,100
Don't stand behind me
in order to make eyes at him.

512
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,800
Better get Philip some more ale.

513
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,500
EXHALES LOUDLY

514
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,600
SLURPS, EXHALES

515
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:58,900
My word! Is there anything better
than English ale?

516
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:02,000
Let us thank God
for simple pleasures -

517
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,200
a good appetite,
roast beef and beer.

518
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,000
I was married to a lady once.

519
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:15,000
Good heavens! Never marry a lady,
my boy! Oh, really? Why?

520
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:21,700
Because a lady has a point of view,
a personality and an individuality
to devil you with.

521
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:27,600
You want a wife who can cook dinner
and look after your children.
Don't you think so, Sally?

522
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:31,900
I think you'd talk the hind legIt's clean fun.

523
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:34,000
Now, Sally, I'll wait on you.

524
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Take my chair while I fetch you
and the young man some cheese.
Thank you, Father.

525
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,400
What do you think of us?

526
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:48,200
You don't know what this means to
me. I practically never had family.

527
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:53,100
This is the only place I've known
that's had the quality of...home.

528
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,700
Don't you think us a little queer?

529
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:59,100
Everyone's queer but me and thee.

530
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:02,800
And sometimes
thee is a little queer.

531
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,700
Thank you, Father.

532
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:15,200
It's no use mooning over her, Carey.

533
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:20,600
Sally never kisses a gentleman
until he's been here twice.

534
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:26,100
Well, you must ask me again,
some time.

535
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:28,500
Do it yourself!

536
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:31,600
Why don't you come next Sunday?

537
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:23,100
May I walk to the station with you?
No. Why not?

538
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:26,600
It's too late and you're a child.I'm 20.

539
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:29,500
Let's talk it over when you're 30.

540
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:47,600
Did you hear what I said, old man?

541
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:52,100
Yes, I heard. Sorry if I brought
up a painful subject.

542
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:59,000
I thought you'd be interested to
hear about Mildred. Sorry she's hadI gave her all I could.

543
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:04,100
But you know me, always stony broke.
I thought perhaps you'd want to...

544
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:08,000
I can't do anything.Go on.

545
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,100
I don't blame you.

546
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:15,000
I wouldn't have told you. She asked
me to give you her address.

547
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:20,500
Gave me a jolt, seeing her with that
baby, asking for something to eat.

548
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:23,000
She had the baby with her? Yes.

549
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,600
Not difficult to imagine
her next step.

550
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,400
Baby all right?

551
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:21,900
I'm very grateful to you, Philip.

552
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:29,300
If I could afford it, I'd have given
you a place of your own.
You're welcome to my room.

553
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:33,400
I don't know what would become
of me and...baby...

554
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,700
if you hadn't taken us in.

555
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:37,700
You'd have got on, I expect.

556
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:45,200
You've always been much nicer
to me than I deserved. I'm beginning
to realise how silly I've been.

557
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:50,400
You couldn't help how you felt.
Let's not talk about it, shall we?

558
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,000
I don't feel like that now.

559
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,300
Look here, Mildred. Let's have no
misunderstanding about this.

560
00:59:57,300 --> 01:00:00,100
The reason you're here is... I know.

561
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:04,000
Because you once liked me enough
to want to marry me.

562
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:08,000
Yes.

563
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:13,100
Well, at least I can cook for you
and keep your flat clean.

564
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:21,000
Maybe some day you'll...
you'll feel better about me

565
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:24,700
and things will be like
they used to be.

566
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:31,400
Oh, thanks. I'll smoke it later.

567
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:38,500
Well, er... Good night.

568
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,000
Good night.

569
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,500
Landlady came upstairs
a little while ago.

570
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:42,200
She said, "Mrs Carey," she said.
"How can you stand it?"

571
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:49,100
What's the matter with them? They're
indecent. Disgusting, I calls it.

572
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:52,500
To have drawings
of naked people about.

573
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:57,200
If you want to know what I think,
I've half a mind to take them down.

574
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,400
You'll do nothing of the kind.

575
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,500
I love those pictures, Mildred.

576
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:07,100
I love them for what
they were meant to be.

577
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,700
JAUNTY TUNE BEGINS

578
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:32,200
What happened to it?

579
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:34,100
Hm? What?

580
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:36,800
The way you used to love me.

581
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,800
Oh, I don't know.

582
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:42,200
I was disappointed so often
and hurt so much.

583
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:45,100
What difference does it make?

584
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:49,900
Nothing. Only, remember how you got
when I was so cold to you?

585
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:55,700
You're getting me that way
cos you're so cold to me.

586
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:57,800
No-one else, is there?

587
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:43,500
He's not in love with anybody.

588
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,800
Where were you?

589
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,800
Altherneys'.

590
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:31,400
What are you doing up?

591
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:33,500
I couldn't sleep.

592
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:40,000
Hadn't you better put on
something warmer?

593
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,400
Oh, I'll be all right.

594
01:04:44,800 --> 01:04:47,300
Just let me stay here.

595
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,600
Phil...

596
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:56,800
Phil, I love you so.

597
01:04:56,800 --> 01:05:00,800
Oh, nonsense. T'isn't.
I can't live without you.

598
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:04,900
Please get up. You're making a fool
of yourself and a fool of me.

599
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:07,000
Oh, Phil. Please.

600
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,400
I can't go on like this.

601
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:29,700
Nonsense. You haven't anywhere
to go. Stay as long as you like.

602
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:32,800
But with the definite
understanding...

603
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:43,300
You disgust me.

604
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,800
Me?

605
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:51,000
I disgust YOU?

606
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:53,600
You.

607
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:54,900
You!

608
01:05:54,900 --> 01:06:01,000
You're too fine!
You won't have me but you sit here
looking at your naked females!

609
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Mildred. You cad!

610
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,100
You dirty swine!

611
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:11,400
I never cared for you, not once.
I was always making a fool of you.
You bored me stiff.

612
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:16,300
It made me sick when I let you kiss
me. I did it because you begged me.

613
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:18,400
You drove me crazy!

614
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:23,500
And after you kissed me,
I always use to wipe my mouth!

615
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:28,200
Well, I made up for it.
For every kiss, we laughed at you.

616
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:31,700
Miller and me, and Griffiths and me.
We laughed at you.

617
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:34,400
You were such a mug, a mug, a mug!

618
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:38,400
You gippy-legged monster!

619
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:41,400
You're a cripple! A cripple!

620
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:52,500
You love these things.
You love what they were meant to be.

621
01:06:52,500 --> 01:06:57,300
Well, here's what
they were meant to be!

622
01:07:14,100 --> 01:07:16,300
You want to be a doctor!

623
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:46,300
This will take care
of your medical school.

624
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:06,600
You're leaving? ..Why?

625
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:10,200
My money's gone.What do you intend to do?

626
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:13,300
Oh... Anything.

627
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:21,600
Before you go out into the world,
don't you think we ought
to do something about that foot?

628
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,800
Think it'll do any good?

629
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:26,200
I'll know better tomorrow.

630
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:33,400
How are you, Philip?I'm all right, Sally.

631
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:35,800
How's your foot? Well...

632
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:38,000
Let's try it, shall we?

633
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,100
All right.

634
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:44,200
Careful now.

635
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:28,800
No openings...
Sorry, nothing today...

636
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:33,800
All situations filled...
No experience? Can't use you...

637
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:37,200
Nothing today...
Sorry, no vacancies...

638
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,900
No openings...
Nothing...

639
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:42,700
Nothing... Nothing... Nothing...

640
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:44,700
Nothing... Nothing...

641
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:54,900
TURNS KEY AND PUSHES DOOR

642
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:37,900
Why haven't you been to see us?Oh, I don't know.

643
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,900
I've had things to do.

644
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:45,200
You've been putting on weight.I'm sure you haven't!

645
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:50,200
Why do you say that? The wayOh! That's only my look!

646
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:56,300
It's more than that. I sent you
a note and when you didn't answer
I went to your room.

647
01:10:56,300 --> 01:11:00,900
Your landlady said
she had to put you out.

648
01:11:02,300 --> 01:11:04,700
Hello, Philip!

649
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:21,000
My dear fellow, by pre-arranged
signal, my daughter communicated to
me confirmation of our suspicions.

650
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,800
As you know, I've been on the beach
most of my life.

651
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:28,400
In Tahiti, I was President
of the Beachcombers' Union!

652
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:32,300
I would like to enquire
into your amateur standing.

653
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:34,700
Where have you been staying?

654
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:38,200
Oh...anywhere.Why didn't you come here?

655
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:42,300
False modesty, I suppose.
Now, stop being an Englishman.

656
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:46,500
When a man's on his uppers,
it's time he came down to Earth.

657
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:49,400
We want you here with us. Well, I...

658
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:56,500
Thanks very much, but... You're
to stay until you get your bearings.

659
01:11:56,500 --> 01:12:00,800
I want no more fine talk about it.
It's all arranged.

660
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:04,100
Well...

661
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:08,600
Well, here goes my amateur standing.

662
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:11,400
I-I really have no place to go.

663
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:16,200
It's awfully good of you. Nonsense!
The house is completely unsanitary.

664
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:20,100
You'll wind up with some
foul disease! Let him alone, Father.

665
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:24,000
I want to talk to him.I suppose youth must be served.

666
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:28,000
But I'm sick and tired
of serving it. Nine of them!

667
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:32,400
Will that do?

668
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,600
Looks as if it might.

669
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:41,300
Wouldn't be a nice night to be out.

670
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:45,700
Not really. No. It's going to be
jolly having you here.

671
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:49,700
I hope I shan't have to stay
very long. Why?

672
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:53,100
I can't go on like this, you know.
I need a job.

673
01:12:53,100 --> 01:12:57,200
Father and I discussed that.There isn't much you've overlooked.

674
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:03,600
I'll have to sew that on, too.
And Father has a job for you.

675
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:06,100
Has he? Where? Where he works.

676
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:00,800
You're walking all right now.

677
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:04,100
I saw you in the window.

678
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:10,200
I never thought you'd come to that.

679
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:12,900
COUGHS SHARPLY

680
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:16,300
You're very hoarse. Throat sore?

681
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:23,200
You haven't forgotten
your doctoring, have you? No.

682
01:14:23,200 --> 01:14:28,200
Because...that's what I want
to see you about.

683
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:30,500
Why not go to a doctor?

684
01:14:34,200 --> 01:14:38,800
There's the Free Hospital.All them students staring at me?

685
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,900
COUGHS

686
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:46,800
What seems to be the trouble?Well, I cough all the time.

687
01:14:48,900 --> 01:14:52,000
Let's have a look at your throat.

688
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,700
Phil.

689
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:24,700
It's not...me lungs, is it?

690
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:32,400
SOBS GENTLY

691
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,800
Where's the baby?

692
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:48,400
She died last summer.

693
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:49,700
Oh.

694
01:15:49,700 --> 01:15:54,000
You might say you're sorry.I'm not. I'm very glad.

695
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:02,000
I'm afraid I can't help you much.

696
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:13,200
Don't leave me, Philip.
I know I've treated you shocking.

697
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:17,300
But don't leave me. Not yet, please.
There's no-one I can go to.

698
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:21,300
You're the only one that treated me
like I was human.

699
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:25,500
You're a gentleman, Philip.
The only one I've ever met.

700
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,500
COUGHS

701
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,200
Some things you'll need.

702
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:25,900
Our last day.

703
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,200
Why, Sally!

704
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:34,000
Darling.

705
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,800
I was so determined
not to let you see.

706
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:42,200
Well, that's sweet of you
to care because I'm going away.

707
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:50,800
I suppose I'm a fool to care,
but it doesn't mean you have to do
anything about it.

708
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:55,600
You can't help it because someone
loves you and you don't love back.

709
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,900
Sally, look at me.

710
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:04,800
Darling, do you think you'll always
feel like this about me?

711
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:06,300
Yes.

712
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:12,000
I've known it since the first time
you came to our house.

713
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:17,400
I thought at first that
I meant something to you, too.

714
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:19,400
Oh, but you did.

715
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:21,300
You do.

716
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:27,700
When I come back, if you feel the
same, will you marry me, darling?

717
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:35,200
Don't you mean if YOU feel the same?

718
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:46,500
VOICES SHOUT AND ARGUE OUTSIDE

719
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:58,200
This is what you might call
the irony of fate.

720
01:18:58,200 --> 01:19:01,800
Come on now. Be quick.
Get her out of here.

721
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:06,600
I don't want the likes of her
on me hands.

722
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:16,800
I understand there's an interestingDon't go in there.

723
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,800
Why not?

724
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:21,200
If you please... It's no use.

725
01:19:49,800 --> 01:19:52,200
Philip, I'm sorry I'm late.

726
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,700
You're not. I'm not going.

727
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:04,200
What's that?

728
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,800
My wedding present to my wife.

729
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:14,800
When do you intend to marry me?

730
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:16,700
Right away.

731
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:18,600
Thank you, Philip.

732
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:21,100
Oh, I beg your pardon.

733
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:23,400
You don't seem very pleased.

734
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:25,700
Well, I am and I'm not.

735
01:20:25,700 --> 01:20:29,600
Why? I'm afraid
it's only a noble gesture.

736
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:34,400
That's not enough for marriage.No, Sally. It isn't just that.

737
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:38,000
I like you far too much
to stand in your way.

738
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,100
WHISTLE BLOWS

739
01:20:43,700 --> 01:20:47,000
HORNS BLOW

740
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:51,000
CACOPHONY DROWNS OUT CONVERSATION

741
01:20:57,700 --> 01:21:01,500
WHISTLE BLOWS, HORNS STOP

742
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:10,800
Philip, you're free. Yes,
but suddenly there's nowhere to go.

743
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,300
Taxi, sir? No, thanks.

744
01:21:13,300 --> 01:21:16,000
I had to be free to realise that,

745
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:23,100
free to understand that all those
years I dreamed of escape was
because I was limping through life.

746
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:25,500
Taxi, sir? No, thank you!

747
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:31,000
And because I was bound up with
a person who was incredible to me.

748
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
That's all over.

749
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:38,100
I'm not limping any more. My life's
all right. Then why don't you go?

750
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:44,700
Because everything that's beautiful
to me is right here.

751
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:47,400
Won't you please marry me, Sally?

752
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:52,200
If you like. But don't you want to?

753
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Well, there's no-one else I'd marry.

754
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:01,800
< How about a taxi, sir?

755
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:04,800
What? How about a taxi?

756
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,800
Yes.

757
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:27,200
