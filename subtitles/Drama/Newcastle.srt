1
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,679
(Crossing bell)

2
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,891
(Foghorn)

3
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:58,147
- What the fuck...?!
- (Door slams)

4
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,447
She kick you out again?

5
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,962
You go in my room again
and I'll fucking kill ya.

6
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,915
Well, nice hair there, Faggus! (Laughs)

7
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,969
That deserves a noogie,
don't you think?

8
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,763
Goddammit, Victor, I ain't having
your bullshit in this house!

9
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:26,138
It's all right. Won't be here long.

10
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,516
- Good.
- (Whispers) Fuck.

11
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,647
Oh fuck off, man, no!

12
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,316
(Reggie) Hey, watch your language!

13
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,654
Hurry up!

14
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,160
(Fergus) Occupied.

15
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,162
That's it.
I'm going to shit on your pillow.

16
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,204
(Fergus) Hey, come on.

17
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,906
(Jesse) Yeah, oh! Flush the guitar.
Yeah.

18
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:50,787
(Jesse) That's right.
Get the fuck out.

19
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:56,594
Dun-dun-dun, poing!
Oh, you cunt.

20
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,557
Still riding that piece of shit?

21
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,601
Yeah, I'm getting
my new board today, though.

22
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,095
- About time.
- Fuck off.

23
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,887
You coming to my trial, Mum?

24
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,191
Love, you know I got work on.
Good luck, though.

25
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,815
- Don't blow it. Again.
- Fuck off!

26
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,862
Hey! Enough of that language.
I'll see you tonight.

27
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,947
Yeah, righto. Dad'll be over.

28
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:26,332
- Yeah. No worries. I'll see you tonight.
- Victor, are you coming for dinner?

29
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,581
Most likely.
He's got nowhere else to go.

30
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,083
Oh! Shush, you.

31
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:32,834
- Dad didn't even say nothing.
- About what?

32
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,497
My surf trial.

33
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:38,375
Love, he's been through all that
with Victor. You'll be right.

34
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,507
Oh, purple now.

35
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:44,843
Oi.

36
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,813
- I'll come, Jess.
- Yeah, as if.

37
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:59,018
Never knock back a fan, Jess.
Hey. Hello?

38
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,776
- Hey, Gramps.
- Go your hardest.

39
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,699
And, for Chrissake,
enjoy yourself out there.

40
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,743
OK, ready? Er, love the hair.

41
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,786
(Boy) Hey, hurry up!

42
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,124
(Excited chatter)

43
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:18,169
Yeah! Whoo!

44
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:20,754
- (Jesse) Shit, yeah!
- Hello, Nate.

45
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,550
Yes! My new board!
Check out the rails on this, man.

46
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:26,514
Whoa, whoa, whoa! No, no, no, Jesse.
No, Jess, not today, mate.

47
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,466
- Maybe next time.
- (Jesse) Oh, come on.

48
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,596
That's not part of the deal, Jess.
You gotta get in the contest first.

49
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,604
- Like I'm not gonna.
- (Roy) See ya, boys!

50
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,686
- Thanks, Dad.
- See ya, Dad.

51
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,476
Fuck it, man.
It's got the new H2s and everything.

52
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,107
- (Scotty) Hey, Ripley.
- How are ya?

53
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,534
- Nice board, mate.
- Yeah. It goes good, eh.

54
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,073
(Horn honking)

55
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:47,856
(Danny) Come on, move!
Get this shit out of the back!

56
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,320
(Scotty laughs)

57
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:53,120
(Danny) Whoa, sorry there, mate.
Sorry, Sonny.

58
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,826
Go on. Don't just stand there
like a bunch of flaccid penises.

59
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,327
Get this shit out of my car!

60
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,668
- You're the one that's late.
- Come on, Sonny.

61
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,463
Move it!

62
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:05,167
You, erm, you have a couple
last night, Danny?

63
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:10,468
Yeah, get that bloody deckchair, too.
I'll be needing that.

64
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,256
- (Horn)
- There's your call, mate.

65
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,270
- Fuck off. I ain't staying here.
- Just like your bro said.

66
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,063
Half-brother,
and don't say shit about him.

67
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,976
Righto, righto, righto.

68
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,015
Righto. Shut your cakeholes.

69
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,569
- Now we got two spots.
- Two spots?

70
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,993
- (Danny) That's all they're giving this year.
- Shit!

71
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,282
- There go your chances.
- Get fucked, Ripley.

72
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,776
- Oh yeah?
- (Jesse) Yeah, really!

73
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,407
- Really?
- (Danny) Hey! Hey!

74
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,584
Hey, hey! Hey, cut it out!

75
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,543
Cut it out.

76
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,793
Any aggro or dropping in
is going to cost you points.

77
00:07:37,915 --> 00:07:38,825
I ain't the one...

78
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,248
- You want to stand there all day...
- Oh, fuck's sake.

79
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:43,337
..or did you come here to fucking surf?

80
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,013
Why don't you give me your boardshorts?
I'll give you a skirt.

81
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,382
- Keep going.
- Righto.

82
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:51,643
This is how it's going to work.
Cunny, write this down.

83
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,932
Everyone will have 15-minute heats.

84
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:56,976
Best two waves,
the two blokes go through.

85
00:07:57,101 --> 00:08:00,191
So, erm, Jesse.

86
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,773
- Er... Fuck, what's his name?
- (Scotty laughs) It's Nathan.

87
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,650
(Danny) Nathan.
Nathan, Ripley and Andy, you're up.

88
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,323
- It's ours.
- Fuck, yeah.

89
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,373
Yeah, what about me?

90
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,202
Yeah, well...

91
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,697
You and Cunny
can keep score for me.

92
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:22,293
Hey, Derek.
You're on the horn, mate.

93
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,513
(Sounds horn)

94
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:27,921
(Laughter)

95
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:32,049
Fucking hell! Not in me ear! Fuck off!
Give me the bloody horn. Get out of it.

96
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,670
(Barks)

97
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,447
Oh, Andy!

98
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,425
My arse.
His first wave, Andy gets a nine.

99
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,845
Give him a nine. Give him a nine.

100
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,607
The boys are up.

101
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:54,686
(Jesse) Move!

102
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,360
Oi! Oi!

103
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,161
Double! Check it out!

104
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,954
Hey! Shitheads!

105
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:30,225
Double interference!
You get nothing! Nothing!

106
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,201
- (Sounds horn)
- Shitheads!

107
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:41,452
You would have got an eight
but you get fucking nothing.

108
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:44,405
- You blew my ride!
- Fuck off! It was mine!

109
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,867
You didn't fucking call it.

110
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,496
- Get fucked, Jesse.
- Prick!

111
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,634
You just stay the fuck out of my way,
Nathan.

112
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,211
Jesse, chill out.
There's going to be another wave.

113
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,047
Later, faggots.

114
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,396
Give him a six.

115
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,239
Six?

116
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,244
Ripley?

117
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:24,446
Fuck, give him a seven, then.
I don't give a fuck.

118
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,370
Shit!

119
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,560
You know, it ain't an ashtray.

120
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:55,153
Yeah, it ain't a toilet either,
but we still piss in it.

121
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,491
We're all going to have to put in
some extra time this weekend.

122
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,072
We've got to overhaul a big one
that's coming in.

123
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,318
Don't look at me. I got off.

124
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,160
So do some of the other blokes,
but they're still willing to put in.

125
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,790
Why would I do that?

126
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,326
'Cause this is the job
that feeds your kids now, right?

127
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,290
Not bloody surfing.

128
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,380
Yeah, you got that right.
They get every bloody cent.

129
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,800
I'm just trying to help you out, son.

130
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,889
(Foghorn)

131
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,604
A little too late to be playing daddy.

132
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,725
You know, I stuck my neck out for you.

133
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,078
Damn it, Fergus!

134
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,674
Hi, Mick. How's the water?

135
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:02,546
- Ah, it's good today, Bette.
- Good.

136
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,756
Who's that?

137
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,429
- Bette.
- (Laughs) Bette?

138
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,433
Hey. How long?

139
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,940
- Just over a minute.
- Is that all?

140
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:18,772
- Well, you're not a bloody fish, mate.
- I'm trying to build my lung capacity.

141
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,479
Well, just get Jess and his mates
to teach you to surf already.

142
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,650
Yeah, like that's gonna happen.

143
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,609
- (Jesse) Why the hell are you surfing?
- Uh-oh.

144
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,529
- All you do is fuck things up!
- Don't even fucking go there!

145
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,909
- It was my fucking wave!
- (All shouting)

146
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,463
- I didn't make it either.
- Oh, like you had a fucking chance!

147
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:41,167
- Fuck.
- (Andy) He's right, it's not that big a deal.

148
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,297
You don't even wanna be
in the fucking contest, Andy.

149
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,804
I mean, do you want anything?

150
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:47,925
Oh no, that's right,
you've already got it all.

151
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,973
Jess. How'd you go?

152
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,257
Fucking third.

153
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,680
Man, I'd give you my spot,
but my Dad would kill me.

154
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,139
Oh, that's big of you.

155
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,272
You want to talk about it?

156
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:00,938
You sure?

157
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:26,761
Just keep at it, Jess.
Your time will come.

158
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,474
A whole 'nother year
in this shithole, Gramps.

159
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,925
You've got a funny definition
of a shithole, Jess.

160
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:45,283
All right, here it goes. I reckon
we should hit Stocko this weekend.

161
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:48,322
- Here we go.
- Camp the dunes, get some waves.

162
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,947
(Scotty) Be sweet as.
(Nathan) How?

163
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,365
(Scotty) Ah, you.

164
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,873
- Me?
- Yeah, you. You got your Ps.

165
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,035
Like my olds
are gonna let me drive out there.

166
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,962
Fuck. His olds.

167
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:04,205
How about if you just don't tell them,
you dickhead?

168
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,458
Funny, Scotty!

169
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:09,219
(Andy) Aren't your parents
going away this weekend?

170
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,143
- Yeah, to Sydney.
- Hmm.

171
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:12,761
Well, there you go.

172
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:16,098
What do you reckon, Jess?
I'll snag some beers off Danny again.

173
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,265
Like I'm going away
with you fucking tools!

174
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:21,654
It's better than spending
the weekend with Victor and Fag Boy.

175
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:24,572
Don't say shit about Victor.
You don't know nothin' about him.

176
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,697
Oi. Jess.

177
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,111

Youse wanna hang out with us?

183
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,215
- What are you doing?
- (Debra) I don't know.

184
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,842
Maybe. (Giggles)

185
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:53,890
Hi, Nathan.

186
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,563
(Mimics) Hi, Nate.

187
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,271
Why? You guys going somewhere?

188
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:01,812
Well, erm, Nathan has got a car,
you see, so...

189
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,477
(They laugh)

190
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,225
So yeah.

191
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:12,113
- (Laughter)
- (Nathan) No. No.

192
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:14,159
Hey! Piss off.

193
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,873
OK, what if I can't get the keys?

194
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,333
Oh, you'll get 'em.

195
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:21,253
No. Mum'll stash 'em somewhere.
Or take 'em. She's not stupid!

196
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,333
- Neither are you!
- Exactly.

197
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,039
Look, come on, Jess.
Stop being such a pussy, dude.

198
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,380
Debra's gonna go
and you'll get your chance with her.

199
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:31,505
- She said she's keen.
- Do you reckon they'll show?

200
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:35,263
Shit, yeah!
Leah's like totally into you, dude.

201
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,137
All right. I'll tell my mum
I'm training at yours.

202
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,215
Yeah, youse all say
you're staying at mine.

203
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,930
Me, I'll say I'm staying at Nate's.

204
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,191
We'll be back by Sunday.
No one will ever know.

205
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,443
Exactly.

206
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,324
Come on, Jess. No surf fest, man,

207
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,941
but looks like you
could be taking Debra's V, who knows?

208
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,109
More like she'll be taking his.

209
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,817
(Scotty laughing) Oh, yeah.

210
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:56,317
- (Toilet flushing)
- I knew that would get him.

211
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,252
(Laughs)

212
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:04,121
- What?
- Well, where we going?

213
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,499
Fucking Fergus.
What are you doing in there?

214
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,753
You're not going anywhere, Fergus.

215
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,460
What's the problem, man?
May as well.

216
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,720
Oh. Yeah, right. Faggus. In the dunes?

217
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,223
Man, have you seen his get-up?

218
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,095
He doesn't wanna go.
He's just bullshitting.

219
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:20,062
(Andy) Yes, he does.
What's your problem?

220
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,182
He's your brother, man.

221
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,322
Whatever.
Just don't bloody tell Mum and Dad.

222
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,731
Yeah, like I'm gonna say anything.

223
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,409
You got fucking third?

224
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,787
You whacking off?

225
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,549
No! Nathan stuffed me up.

226
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:17,261
Billy's already giving me shit
about Rip getting in over ya.

227
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,182
Fuck Ripley,
I'm better than he is.

228
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,841
- Danny's a fucking dickhead.
- Oh, Danny's a dickhead.

229
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:26,060
You weren't even there,
you fucking loser.

230
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:27,603
What the fuck was that,
you little shit?

231
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,186
Fuck off. Fuck! Get off me!

232
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,862
- Call me a fucking loser, huh?
- Yeah, you're a fucking loser.

233
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,731
We're gonna play a little game
of fucking Jesse typewriter.

234
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:39,199
- J-E, double-S. Oh, spelt it wrong.
- Fucking get off me!

235
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,161
- Get off!
- Don't ya like that one?

236
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,781
- Get off me!
- (Hawks)

237
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,868
(Reggie) Get off him. Victor.
(Jesse) Fuck off!

238
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:48,583
- Get off. Just get off. Grow up!
- You want me to go already?

239
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:53,205
- Fucking go, huh?
- Go downstairs and chill out! Go on.

240
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,085
- You all right?
- Yeah.

241
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,712
Go downstairs and help your mother.

242
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,418
- Go to your mummy, third-place pussy.
- Victor!

243
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:03,089
And Jess, pull your pants up.
For God's sake!

244
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,096
(Slams door)

245
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,215
What have you got so much stuff for?

246
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:53,100
I got Dad coming over and all youse ever do
is eat everything up.

247
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,898
Got some of them nice meat pies
you like.

248
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,942
I'm going to Scotty's for the weekend.

249
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:59,565
- For the weekend?
- Yeah. The surf's gonna be heaps good.

250
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,573
No. I don't want you
sponging off them like that.

251
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:04,815
I'm not sponging off them.
Scotty invited me and Fergus.

252
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,236
- What you up to?
- Nothing.

253
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:10,328
You're taking Fergus to Scotty's
for the weekend?

254
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,954
- Yeah, so?
- What's going on?

255
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,040
Nothing. I'm going over to Scotty's
for the weekend with Fergus. Mum!

256
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,878
Just making sure there ain't
no funny business going on.

257
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,714
You know Mum's making dinner tonight?

258
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,969
Yeah, I know, I forgot.
But it's Scotty's birthday.

259
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:28,102
(Sighs) No answer.
Do you know about this?

260
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:32,519
- What?
- (Flora) This weekend.

261
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:33,732
(Whispers) Yes.

262
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,312
Yeah, er...

263
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:39,438
I already told you guys.
Scotty invited us at the pool.

264
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,276
- Right. To his house.
- (Jesse) Yeah.

265
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,991
We're gonna teach Fag...erm,
Fergus how to surf.

266
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,452
- Who's "we"?
- Everyone.

267
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,452
Like Nathan, Scotty, Andy.

268
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,624
- And whose idea was this?
- Well...

269
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,243
- Gramps.
- Yeah, Gramps.

270
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:54,081
- You wanna go?
- Yeah.

271
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,826
- Got a new pair of boardshorts.
- With what money?

272
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,628
Mowing lawns.

273
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,592
Yeah, cool. So we can go?

274
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,052
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
How'd you go today, anyway?

275
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:04,883
He blew it. Shit!

276
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:08,008
(Reggie) Oh, great!
(Flora) Bit of paint, you'll never know.

277
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:11,216
Nathan doubled up on Jesse's wave,
got his best ride disqualified.

278
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:15,138
So he came in third and they're only giving
out two spots this year, so...

279
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:16,768
Oh.

280
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,695
You behave yourself over there.

281
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,615
I don't want his mum calling me
with no stories.

282
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,794
No. She won't. She won't.

283
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,728
(Car engine revving)

284
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,852
(Kids cheering)

285
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,819
(Leah) Can you slow down?
(Scotty) No, go faster!

286
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:52,068
(All groan)

287
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:56,659
- Oh, spit it out.
- Don't get it on me!

288
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:59,326
(Scotty) Oh! That's classic!
(Andy) You all right, man?

289
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:02,916
(Laughs) Oh, yuck.

290
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,383
(Jesse) Oh, that's wrong!

291
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,383
- (Fergus groans)
- (Jesse) Damn!

292
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,375
Bloody hell, Fergs.

293
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:12,302
You look like a fucking
plucked chicken or some shit.

294
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,297
- (Jesse) So good.
- You're white enough!

295
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:17,139
- Shut up, Scotty.
- (Scotty) What, you keen on him?

296
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:19,925
Hey. You OK?

297
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,850
(Scotty) You boys
got something going on?

298
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,398
Yeah. Sort of.

299
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:27,572
(Scotty) Oh, don't get me wrong.
I'm cool with it. I'm cool with it.

300
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:29,282
Oi, let's get there already!
Come on!

301
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:32,402
(Andy) Let's go, Fergs.
(Debra) Yeah, guys. Let's go.

302
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:35,371
(Scotty) I'm cool, man.
I'm down with it.

303
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,454
- You all right, mate?
- Yeah.

304

straight from the gut.

305
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:46,631
Oh, yeah.

306
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:49,923
One of Nate's best works, I'd say,
this one, huh?

307
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,258

No.

361
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,728
Bullshit, look at it!

362
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,311

363
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,647

Don't look!

365
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,570
It's not a boner, it's just big,

366
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,237

about that, would ya, Scotty?

367
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:11,826

Shit, man.
These s'mores are good.

Wait. And here's to Andy.

407
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,936
The next Pro Junior Champ, eh?

408
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:11,106
There's a lot of guys
I gotta beat before that happens.

409
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:15,079
- Ripley for one.
- Ripley?! I like the guy, but fuck.

410
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:18,701
Ripley, man?
You could piss all over Ripley, dude.

- Scotty!

416
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:33,047
He's never gonna be world champion.
He doesn't want it.

417
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:35,047
- What, like you, you mean?
- Fucking oath.

418
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:38,769
Yeah, look, Jess, mate. Get over it, hey?
There's more to life.

419
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:41,141
If you'd didn't fuck me up
I'd be halfway there already.

Look, we're all having a good time here,
don't ruin it.

I don't want to mess up
your perfect life.

422
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:47,771
- What?
- (Debra) Jesse!

423
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:51,240
- I got no one paying my way, do I?
- You don't fucking know anything, Jess!

424
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:54,952
- Go fuck yourself, Nathan.
- You dudes! Don't go there.

425
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,914
It's not about all that shit.

426
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,155
I don't have a dad who's an agent either,
do I, Andy?

427
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,327
Dude.

428
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:02,575
You guys get whatever you want
for doing nothing.

429
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:05,037
- Jesse, just chill out.
- Fuck off, Fergus.

430
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:11,014
Great, Jesse, yeah. You're better than
all your friends, you don't need anyone,

431
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,682
and you're going to be world champ, great,
we all agree. OK?

432
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:16,391
Yeah, well, we all know
why you're here, don't we, Faggus?

00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:27,805
Yeah, run, you pussy.

437
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,820
Yeah, real good, Jesse.

00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,570
Way to go, Jess. Way to go, mate.

00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,684
Hey, you.

441
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,984
I'm just sick of their shit.
You know, I'm as good as Andy is.

442
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,395

- I'm gonna make the tour.

443
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:10,694
Shut up.

444
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,785
Looks like a face.

00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,536
Er...you mean the saucepan?

446
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,169
Yeah.

447
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:38,258
Looks like one of those faces
Picasso paints, doesn't it?

448
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:42,852
See? The eyes, the nose,

449
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:46,064

look like a mouth.

450
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:51,900

- (Laughs) Yeah, I'm not an idiot.

451
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:55,864
It's just that when I tell people
it looks like a face,

452
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,317
theyjust think I'm weird.

453
00:35:57,446 --> 00:36:00,526

(Laughs) I'm just messing with ya.

455
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:12,995
It'd be cool to know
what all those stars were, though.

456
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,049

Sorry.

(Giggling)

513
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:47,822
Should have known.
Should have known!

514
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:55,791
Yeah.

515
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:59,871
♪ Oh, I don't want
no complication

516
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:05,299
♪ I don't need no obligation

517
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:17,354
Do you want to?

518
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,595
- I don't know.
- Come on.

519
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:20,727
I do, but...

520
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:24,193
I really like you, Deb.
I mean that. I really do.

521
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,935
Right. Do you have a condom?

522
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:29,937
Oh, shit, no. Do you?

523
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,200
- No.
- Fuck.

524
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,663
I'll pull out.

525
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:36,372

- Come on, I promise.

526
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,494
OK.

527
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,916
- There?
- You're too high.

528
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:46,594
Wait. Down.

529
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,302

Yeah.

540
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:46,651
Sort of.

541
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:51,606
Well, no. Not really, I guess.

542
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:57,994
You jerk off?

543
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,237
What?

544
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:01,948
(Laughs) No!

545
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:06,535
Shit. I do it all the time.

(Fergus) From time to time.

550
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:30,478
So you want to now?

551
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,648
What?!

552
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:35,323
Are you serious?

553
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,205
- (Debra) You didn't pull out.
- Yeah, I did.

554
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:49,002
- No, you didn't.
- I didn't come much.

555
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,300

What the fuck are you doing,
you fucking idiot?

Sorry, mate, I'm not interested.

580
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,383

Hey.

606
00:46:50,516 --> 00:46:51,426
Go home, Victor.

607
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,678
What are you talkin' about?
I came to see Kylie.

608
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,601
Did you? You're pissed.

609
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:58,150
So?

610
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:02,192

- Hey, sweetie.

611
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,579
Hi. Hey.

Yo.

613
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,712
What did you do today?

00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,047
Stuff.

615
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:25,681
(Sandra) Hey, babe?

616
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:30,601
You wanna go inside for a bit
because Mummy wants to speak to Daddy.

617
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:32,432
Cool?

618
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:36,103
It's going to be all right. I promise.

619
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:37,728
(Kisses Kylie's hand)

620
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:48,410
- Victor, just...just go home, right?
- What you talkin' about?

621
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:50,742
I thought you wanted me to come
see you guys.

622
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:53,998
- Yeah, that was five hours ago.
- I was workin'!

623
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:56,660
Hey, boys!

624
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:58,120
Sandra.

625
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:03,590
Working on what?

626
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:06,724
Did she like it, hm?
Did she like it, babe?

627
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:09,262
- No, baby, don't...
- Did she? Come on, talk me through it.

628
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,886
- Don't.
- What do you think?

629
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:12,893
- Sandy...
- She like that?

630
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:15,595
- Welcome home. Whatever.
- Come on, baby.

631
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,016
- Are you serious?
- Come on, yeah.

632
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,984
Babe, Kylie's been waiting for you
for fucking hours.

633
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:22,725
No, Mum's inside. Fuck off!

634
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:30,824
(Whispers) Oh, babe.

635
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:34,447
- That's amazing.
- No. I can't do this any more.

636
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,458
Oh, do what? Do what?

637
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:41,786
Come here. Come here!
Fucking come here!

638
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:42,919
Good night, Victor.

639
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:44,875
Just...

640
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:46,955
I just wanna...

641
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:52,180
Fuck! Sandra!

642
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:55,974

- Shut the fuck up!

643
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,179
Sandra!

644
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,520
(Jake) Yo, mate, come on!

645
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:04,147
Shit.

646
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,531
See what I mean?

647
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:11,614
She wants me to come see the kids,
and then she doesn't.

648
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:12,740
What's that about?

649
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:14,906
- I don't know, mate.
- Just get in.

650
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:18,203
(Victor) Fuck it.

651
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:13,843
There you are.

652
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:29,324
Fuck, what a loser.

653
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:50,462
Oi, boys!

654
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:55,430
Boys! Get up!

655
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:57,052
Nathan, get up!

656
00:50:57,179 --> 00:51:01,349
(Whoops) Small and glassy, brother,
just the way you like it!

657
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:05,060
Oi, get up!

658
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:12,069
Get up, boys!

659
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:18,322
Small and glassy!

660
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:20,160
Hey!

661
00:51:20,285 --> 00:51:22,785
(Whooping)

662
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:25,333
Oi, let's do this!

663
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:26,367
(Andy) Come on.

664
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,750
(Scotty) Get up!

665
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:31,166
(Andy) I know you're up.

666
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:40,894
- Go on!
- You're up.

667
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:43,184
Hey, if it isn't the man himself, huh?

668
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:45,308
Go crash a car.

669
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:48,728
(Scotty) Okey-dokey.

670
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:57,992
Yeah, it's hell small
but it's pretty glassy.

671
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:00,115
- Good morning.
- (Giggles)

672
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:10,003
(Fergus) Whoo.

673
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:19,474
Oh, yeah.
I'm sorry about last night, dude.

674
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:22,814
Fuck, man, it's all right.
What happened to the car, anyway?

675
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:25,891
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

676
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:27,097
(Both laugh)

677
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:29,397
It'll be all right.

678
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:35,863
How are you doing, brother? Prepped?
You pumped? You ready? Let's do this.

679
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:38,696
Oi, Nato, hurry up, man.
It's glassy as!

680
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:39,742
Huh?

681
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:41,985
Jess! (Whistles)

682
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:43,947
Flop it away.

683
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:46,037
Shut up.

684
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,163
Whoo!

685
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:50,958
Oh, yeah!

686
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:53,004
(Scotty) You too, Fergs.
Come on, mate!

687
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:55,088
(Fergus) Hm?
(Jesse) Come on!

688
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:57,093
I was gonna work on my tan.

689
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,215
Your tan?

690
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:02,428
Grab it.

691
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:03,644
What?

692
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:19,651
Come on.

693
00:54:27,055 --> 00:54:28,635
Keep your legs together.

694
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,555
Always keep your legs together, OK?

695
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:33,104
Just paddle, paddle, paddle,
one, two, three, jump!

696
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:37,689
Yeah! Rippin'.

697
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:40,565
What's Andy doing with Fergus?

698
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:44,664
(Andy) All right, sweet.
(Fergus) Yeah.

699
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,288
All right.

700
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:51,501
(Laughs) You... You put it on your back foot.

701
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:55,211
Oi, Andy! Hurry up!

702
00:54:58,378 --> 00:55:01,548
Before we paddle out...
Wait for a sec. Wait for a sec.

703
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:02,763
Yeah.

704
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:06,092
And then I'll tell you when to go, all right?
Follow me.

705
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:08,099
I'm coming!

706
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:10,561
(Jesse) Hurry up! Hurry up, you homo.

707
00:56:47,612 --> 00:56:49,492
Good on ya, Ferg!

708
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:54,664
You get a couple or what?
Hanging with the big boys now, mate.

709
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:57,695
Wow. It's wild.

710
00:56:57,831 --> 00:57:00,501
(Nathan) What?

711
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:03,085
(Fergus) The beach like that.

712
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:05,881
Well, check this out.

713
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:07,585
(Scotty) Is he serious?

714
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:09,715
(They laugh)

715
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:13,546
- (Camply) Check this out.
- Check this out.

716
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,470
Check me out.

717
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:44,589
Jess, check out these suspects.

718
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:48,337
- See that ride?
- Yeah, you're getting some good ones.

719
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:51,005
Fergus on a board.
Never thought I'd see the day.

720
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:58,022
Yeah, I know it's hard but you
gotta keep your legs together.

721
00:57:58,141 --> 00:57:59,981
Yeah, all three of 'em.

722
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:02,601
Yeah, dude.
Just watch out for that hammer.

723
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:06,573
- What do you mean?
- Like this.

724
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:11,856
Oi.

725
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:14,157
Did he know what he was doing?

726
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:16,702
- (Laughs) No.
- Really?

727
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:17,866
No idea in the world.

728
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:19,704
- Putting it everywhere.
- His first time?

729
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:21,829
- I think so.
- No! I didn't know.

730
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:22,916
Oh, no, yeah.

731
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:24,921
- I thought he would have, for sure.
- No.

732
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:28,343
- It's safe to say no. Yeah, no.
- Really?

733
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:34,050
(Victor) Nothin' I do makes her happy.

734
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,967
(Jake) Oh, she'll be cool.
She'll take you back.

735
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:38,555
Yeah, again.

736
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:42,388
I don't know.

737
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:49,268
- Oi, go this one. Quick.
- What?

738
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,940
Paddle!

739
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:04,328
I just can't believe it happened,
you know.

740
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:05,617
Were you excited?

741
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:08,340
- Yeah.
- I can't believe you finally did it.

742
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:09,841
Is his big?

743
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:20,181
It's just his arms. He's got these
big surfer-like arms and back.

744
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:35,404
Take your leg-rope off.

745
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:13,862
(Andy) Yeah, stand up now!

746
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:16,605
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

747
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:21,121
Whoo! (Laughs)

748
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:07,292
(Cheering)

749
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:11,290
All right,
here comes an easy one, Fergs.

750
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:12,417
Paddle!

751
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:15,253
(Nathan) Go, this one's yours!
Go for it!

752
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:16,840
Look, look, Fergus has got a wave.

753
01:01:16,964 --> 01:01:18,924
(Andy) Yeah!

754
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:21,890
(Whooping, cheering)

755
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:26,558
- Whoo!
- Yeah, Fergs!

756
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:29,183
(All whoop and cheer)

757
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:34,308
Whoo!

758
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:39,151
I love that. And that.

759
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:44,073
Hootie hoo!

760
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:48,201
- Go, Fergus! Whoo!
- Go for it, Fergus!

761
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:49,329
That's great.

762
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:52,329
Wicked.

763
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:53,708
Not bad, Fergus.

764
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:55,785
He's doing so well, mate. Really.

765
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:04,135
I was so embarrassed for Scotty.

766
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:08,222
You should have seen him
last night when he was there.

767
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:10,309
- Toodle-doo.
- (Victor) Hey, girls.

768
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:13,766
(Debra) Hi, Victor.

769
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:20,685
This looks like fun.

770
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,820
(Laughing)

771
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:25,954
Oi.

772
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:39,546
Oh shit,
he's got Fergus out there with him.

773
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:46,471
Just wait here, all right?
We'll head in soon.

774
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:47,926
Good.

775
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:50,465
No worries. We were here first.

776
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,140
They're not gonna see it like that.

777
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:53,848
(Jesse) Fuck 'em.

778
01:03:32,391 --> 01:03:35,811
- You guys aren't supposed to be out here.
- Yeah, right. So?

779
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:38,097
- What's Fergus doing with ya?
- He wanted to come.

780
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:39,771
He doesn't belong out here.

781
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:48,197
- You're still hanging with that Andy kid?
- Yeah, what of it?

782
01:03:57,250 --> 01:04:01,460
I can see why he's on the Pro Junior.
Too bad you're not.

783
01:04:01,587 --> 01:04:03,547
Fuck off, Victor.

784
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:38,540
Fuck it!

785
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:19,250
Man, that kid's all right, eh?

786
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:21,713
Fuck that. Ain't as good as Ripley.

787
01:05:21,834 --> 01:05:23,344
Yeah, you hope, brother.

788
01:05:46,025 --> 01:05:47,145
Oi, look out!

789
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:57,123
I'm glad we're not out there.

790
01:06:05,586 --> 01:06:07,586
(Coughs)

791
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:14,886
You fuckwit!

792
01:06:20,726 --> 01:06:22,556
(Nathan) Yeah. You're a fucking idiot!

793
01:06:24,021 --> 01:06:26,021
Stay, Scotty. One more!

794
01:06:26,148 --> 01:06:28,858
No, fuck that. It ain't worth it.

795
01:06:33,739 --> 01:06:36,119
- Are you all right?
- (Nathan) I'm fine, I'm fine.

796
01:06:36,242 --> 01:06:38,162
Wow, it really snapped in half. Fuck.

797
01:06:38,285 --> 01:06:40,075
My new board's fucked!

798
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:47,093
You guys are arseholes.

799
01:06:47,211 --> 01:06:49,001
You gonna let that guy
get all the good ones?

800
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:50,340
No.

801
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:03,886
No, Fergus. Stop!

802
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:11,190
(Yells)

803
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:28,288
Shit, you got it! Stand!

804
01:07:28,419 --> 01:07:31,419
- (Nathan) Shit, Fergus caught that wave!
- What is he doing?

805
01:07:39,346 --> 01:07:40,386
(Victor) Yeah, Fergus!

806
01:07:41,682 --> 01:07:42,772
(Victor) Keep going!

807
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:57,109
Fuck, Jess! What are you doin'?

808
01:09:44,054 --> 01:09:45,854
Oh, shit.

809
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:53,666
(Panicked shouting)

810
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:55,421
Get out of the fucking way!

811
01:10:55,542 --> 01:10:58,542
(Shouting continues)

812
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:02,342
(Nathan) Watch his neck!
Watch his fucking neck!

813
01:11:03,467 --> 01:11:04,377
Fuck off!

814
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,640
Oh, fuck.

815
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:13,273
(Jesse) Fuck!

816
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:14,604
(Leah) Debra, come on!

817
01:11:14,728 --> 01:11:16,648
(Nathan) Door's shut.
Keep his head straight!

818
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:19,322
- Drive!
- Come on.

819
01:11:19,441 --> 01:11:23,191
- Pump his chest, Fergus!
- One, two, three, four...

820
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:24,650
Drive, man, drive!

821
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:27,450
- Come on, Victor!
- (Coughs)

822
01:11:27,574 --> 01:11:29,704
Come on, Jess!
Come on, Jess!

823
01:11:29,827 --> 01:11:33,707
(Jesse) I can't. Pump harder, Fergus!
Come on!

824
01:11:33,831 --> 01:11:35,961
- He's turning purple!
- Get stuck in, Fergus!

825
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:38,713
Come on! Fucking breathe!

826
01:11:40,004 --> 01:11:42,094
- Come on, Jesse!
- (Leah) Come on, Andy, breathe!

827
01:11:42,214 --> 01:11:44,804
- (Fergus) Come on, Victor!
- Fucking hell!

828
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:48,682
(Squeals) Yeah, that's it.
Come on, Andy, breathe.

829
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:52,346
Breathe! Come on!

830
01:11:55,936 --> 01:11:59,806
Come on, Victor!
Come on! Pump harder, Fergus!

831
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:01,020
Shit!

832
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:05,784
Fucking pump his chest, Fergus!

833
01:12:05,904 --> 01:12:07,704
Fergus, pump his chest!

834
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:11,333
Come on, Victor, breathe!

835
01:12:14,747 --> 01:12:17,117
(Sobs) Come on!

836
01:12:32,389 --> 01:12:35,389
(Door opening)

837
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:51,950
It wasn't his fault!

838
01:12:55,245 --> 01:12:57,155
It wasn't his fault.

839
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:01,038
(Door slams upstairs)

840
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,800
(Baby crying)

841
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:47,268
You OK?

842
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:54,660
What?

843
01:14:54,781 --> 01:14:55,911
Nothing.

844
01:14:56,033 --> 01:14:59,203
I mean, just not now.

845
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:02,328
- You're really special to me, Deb.
- Jesse...

846
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:05,036
- I like you, but...
- But what? I mean...

847
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:08,000
You don't want to be with me?

848
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:11,964
Let's just not talk about it now.

849
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:13,670
So none of that meant anything to you?

850
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:16,340
We had a weekend.

851
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:17,470
Are you pregnant?

852
01:15:17,596 --> 01:15:19,386
No.

853
01:15:32,945 --> 01:15:33,895
Fuck it.

854
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:35,819
No, Jesse, wait.

855
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:40,660
(Nathan) So can you,
like, feel anything?

856
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:43,406
(Andy) Yeah, a little bit.

857
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:46,079
It kinda hurts
but, you know, not really.

858
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:51,673
It feels like everything's there,
but not. You know?

859
01:15:53,465 --> 01:15:55,925
But they said you're gonna be OK?

860
01:15:56,051 --> 01:15:59,391
Yeah, a couple of weeks,
maybe a month,

861
01:15:59,513 --> 01:16:00,643
I'll be up for a wave.

862
01:16:00,764 --> 01:16:02,064
(Scotty) Yeah.

863
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:05,348
No comp though, huh?

864
01:16:05,477 --> 01:16:06,807
No.

865
01:16:17,155 --> 01:16:18,525
Jesse!

866
01:16:24,162 --> 01:16:26,372
I'm just worried about him,
that's all.

867
01:16:26,498 --> 01:16:28,118
He hasn't even been surfing.

868
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:31,535
You're not the only one
worried about him.

869
01:18:18,819 --> 01:18:20,279
What are you doing?

870
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:26,079
- What are you doing?
- Just get away! Get away!

871
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:27,991
- Just get away!
- Jesse!

872
01:18:32,457 --> 01:18:34,037
(Door slams)

873
01:18:47,639 --> 01:18:49,639
(Sobs)

874
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:11,745
(Fergus) Mum?

875
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:18,211
- Dad?
- Fergus!

876
01:19:18,336 --> 01:19:20,916
(Reggie sobbing)

877
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:51,548
(Man) Oi!

878
01:21:03,733 --> 01:21:05,863
You're gonna need this.

879
01:21:05,986 --> 01:21:07,146
What for?

880
01:21:08,738 --> 01:21:11,448
Well, you came in third.

881
01:21:11,575 --> 01:21:14,575
Andy's hurt pretty bad,
so you're next in line.

882
01:21:17,205 --> 01:21:18,655
You up for it?

883
01:21:20,667 --> 01:21:23,747
I ca... Danny, I can't take it.

884
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:25,549
Sign-in's at eight.

885
01:21:26,798 --> 01:21:28,218
Can't change it now.

886
01:21:34,055 --> 01:21:35,675
Just do your best, all right?

887
01:21:47,068 --> 01:21:49,068
If you don't make it...

888
01:21:50,363 --> 01:21:51,743
..everyone'll understand.

889
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:12,090
Nice board, mate.

890
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:19,221
Look, Andy, I'm really sorry, man.

891
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:21,351
It's not your fault.

892
01:22:21,478 --> 01:22:24,058
- Yeah, it is.
- Shut up.

893
01:22:26,066 --> 01:22:28,856
Dude, I shouldn't have dropped in
on your wave. I shouldn't have...

894
01:22:28,985 --> 01:22:30,395
Shut up, all right?

895
01:22:32,113 --> 01:22:33,663
You're in the contest now.

896
01:22:35,575 --> 01:22:38,195
This is what you've always wanted.

897
01:22:38,328 --> 01:22:40,828
- Shit, mate, I...
- Don't worry about me.

898
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:45,208
Andy, it's not...

899
01:22:46,294 --> 01:22:48,254
I don't know,
it's just not important any more.

900
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:50,380
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

901
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:58,217
I mean, all that was Victor's dream.

902
01:23:02,602 --> 01:23:03,812
And what's yours, mate?

903
01:23:13,238 --> 01:23:15,108
I know the feeling.

904
01:23:25,875 --> 01:23:27,415
Ah!

905
01:23:27,544 --> 01:23:28,594
Careful.

906
01:23:28,712 --> 01:23:30,712
(Phone rings)

907
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:39,680
Hello?

908
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:45,272
This is what we need.

909
01:23:47,981 --> 01:23:51,071
So this is what you guys do
when Fergus comes around?

910
01:23:51,192 --> 01:23:52,782
Sometimes.

911
01:23:57,991 --> 01:23:59,531
Figures.

912
01:23:59,659 --> 01:24:00,869
What?

913
01:24:01,828 --> 01:24:04,908
I'm always trying to nick 'em
and you just give 'em to him.

914
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:10,088
Well, he's not so dumb, is he?

915
01:24:13,006 --> 01:24:14,796
Guess not.

916
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:24,603
You know,
life sometimes is a real shit, buddy.

917
01:24:24,726 --> 01:24:27,096
It's a real shit.

918
01:24:38,531 --> 01:24:40,491
You've got to stop blaming yourself.

919
01:24:40,617 --> 01:24:44,577
It was an accident.
You didn't mean to hurt anyone.

920
01:24:46,748 --> 01:24:48,038
(Jesse sniffing)

921
01:24:48,166 --> 01:24:50,576
But I did, Gramps.

922
01:24:52,545 --> 01:24:53,745
Jess.

923
01:25:01,304 --> 01:25:03,314
(Fergus) Gramps?

924
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:05,310
Gramps?

925
01:25:20,198 --> 01:25:21,448
(Fergus) Hey!

926
01:25:31,835 --> 01:25:33,785
(Panting)

927
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:36,550
I ain't surfing the contest.

928
01:25:50,603 --> 01:25:52,563
That's all right.

929
01:25:52,689 --> 01:25:55,109
What's the fucking point?

930
01:26:06,661 --> 01:26:08,791
I don't know.

931
01:26:19,966 --> 01:26:22,006
(Jesse) I'm so over it.

932
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:29,850
When we were eight,

933
01:26:29,976 --> 01:26:34,806
Victor told me I couldn't go surfing
because I had glasses,

934
01:26:34,939 --> 01:26:36,939
and I believed him.

935
01:26:38,651 --> 01:26:43,111
Then when he told me
I didn't fit in with you any more,

936
01:26:43,239 --> 01:26:47,329
and your friends,
I figured he was right.

937
01:26:47,452 --> 01:26:48,702
Fergus, he was just...

938
01:26:48,828 --> 01:26:51,868
But when he told me
that I couldn't play guitar,

939
01:26:51,998 --> 01:26:54,208
and that I'd never be any good
at anything...

940
01:26:56,544 --> 01:26:59,004
I stopped listening to him.

941
01:26:59,130 --> 01:27:00,550
He was just hassling you, man.

942
01:27:00,673 --> 01:27:04,053
Yeah, I know. He was mad.

943
01:27:05,303 --> 01:27:07,853
His mum died
and we came and took his dad away.

944
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:11,811
He just took it out on me.

945
01:27:11,935 --> 01:27:13,385
He gave me shit, too.

946
01:27:13,519 --> 01:27:17,519
Yeah, after he busted his knee,

947
01:27:17,649 --> 01:27:23,149
'cause he knew that you were gonna go
places that he couldn't go any more.

948
01:27:23,279 --> 01:27:26,239
- What, like he was jealous?
- Yeah.

949
01:27:30,536 --> 01:27:31,696
He was lonely.

950
01:27:44,884 --> 01:27:46,184
You still do that?

951
01:27:46,302 --> 01:27:49,892
Yeah.
Best thing you ever showed me.

952
01:28:25,341 --> 01:28:26,841
Jesse?

953
01:28:44,110 --> 01:28:45,400
Jesse!

954
01:28:48,573 --> 01:28:50,993
Oi! Jesse!

955
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:14,641
Whoo!

956
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:19,898
Come on! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

957
01:29:20,021 --> 01:29:21,401
Come on!

958
01:29:21,522 --> 01:29:25,862
Whoo!

959
01:29:27,111 --> 01:29:29,951
Come on! It's great.

960
01:29:33,493 --> 01:29:39,873
Whoo!

961
01:29:39,999 --> 01:29:41,999
(Fergus continues whooping)

962
01:29:45,421 --> 01:29:46,631
Come on!

963
01:29:47,632 --> 01:29:48,762
(Cheers)

964
01:29:53,471 --> 01:29:54,971
(Wolf whistle)

965
01:31:25,438 --> 01:31:26,858
- Shit!
- Oh, fuck.

966
01:31:33,404 --> 01:31:35,324
(Jesse) Fuck.

967
01:31:36,866 --> 01:31:38,066
OK, wait here.

968
01:31:40,870 --> 01:31:42,250
(Whispers) Come on.

969
01:31:46,959 --> 01:31:48,629
(Lifeguard) Hey!
(Jesse) Run!

970
01:31:48,753 --> 01:31:53,513
Get off my friggin' beach!
Go on, go and get some clothes on!

971
01:31:53,633 --> 01:31:56,133
Go on, get goin'! Get out of here.

972
01:31:56,260 --> 01:31:59,470
Go on! What do you think it is?

973
01:31:59,597 --> 01:32:02,017
Get out of here!

974
01:32:02,141 --> 01:32:04,521
(Both laughing)

975
01:32:04,644 --> 01:32:06,814
- Pumping, isn't it?
- Where have you been?

976
01:32:06,938 --> 01:32:09,938
(Indistinct chatter)

977
01:32:39,512 --> 01:32:41,392
- (Jesse) Here you go.
- Get the...

978
01:32:41,514 --> 01:32:47,524
(Dog barking)

979
01:32:58,155 --> 01:33:00,155
(Blender)

980
01:33:12,712 --> 01:33:14,962
Urgh! Gramps.

981
01:33:22,054 --> 01:33:23,434
(Floorboards creaking)

982
01:33:23,556 --> 01:33:24,926
(Gramps) Been for a swim?

983
01:33:25,057 --> 01:33:26,727
- Yeah.
- Hi, Gramps.

984
01:33:26,851 --> 01:33:29,191
What the hell happened
to your clothes?

985
01:33:29,312 --> 01:33:31,692
- What are you doing here?
- Hm!

986
01:33:31,814 --> 01:33:36,824
- You got a contest to go, don't ya?
- Yeah.

987
01:33:38,404 --> 01:33:40,114
(Laughter)

988
01:33:40,239 --> 01:33:42,949
- (Sandra) Good luck, boys.
- Eyes.

989
01:33:43,075 --> 01:33:44,985
All right, sweetheart.

990
01:35:28,806 --> 01:35:30,386
Yeah, Jesse!

991
01:35:30,516 --> 01:35:32,306
(All cheer)

992
01:35:36,605 --> 01:35:37,725
Go on, Jesse.

993
01:35:40,317 --> 01:35:41,567
Wow!

994
01:35:41,694 --> 01:35:43,454
(Cheering)

995
01:35:43,571 --> 01:35:45,611
(Whooping)

996
01:35:46,907 --> 01:35:48,527
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yay, Jess!

997
01:35:49,660 --> 01:35:50,580
Andrew!

998
01:35:50,703 --> 01:35:53,333
(PA commentary)

999
01:36:02,214 --> 01:36:06,474
(Commentator) Mitch Rusedski and Jesse
Hoff. Three locals take on the surfer...

1000
01:36:38,834 --> 01:36:41,804
(Commentator) ..up on the inside,
a couple of big moves.

1001
01:36:41,921 --> 01:36:44,091
- Great wave.
- (Commentator) Jesse Hoff.

1002
01:36:48,761 --> 01:36:50,471
Oh, no!

1003
01:36:50,596 --> 01:36:51,676
Ooh!

1004
01:36:56,811 --> 01:36:58,561
(Woman shouting)

1005
01:38:01,292 --> 01:38:03,462
- Oh, sorry.
- Watch the contest.

1006
01:38:07,381 --> 01:38:08,591
Definitely intensive.

1007
01:38:13,387 --> 01:38:14,847
- Not bad.
- For a bum out.

1008
01:38:21,145 --> 01:38:23,645
(Commentator) Jesse Hoff
has the whole line-up to himself.

1009
01:38:23,772 --> 01:38:25,192
Come on, Jess.

01:41:51,939 --> 01:41:53,819
Come on, already!

1013
01:41:53,941 --> 01:41:55,271
(Flora) Coming!

1014
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:01,660
(Jesse) Oi, tell your boyfriend to hurry up!
(Fergus) Shut up!

1015
01:42:01,782 --> 01:42:04,452
(Andy) What did he say?
(Fergus) Nothing.

1016
01:42:04,576 --> 01:42:08,616
(Jesse) Oi! Wankers!

1017
