1
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:22,341
You like all kinds of music, huh?

2
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:26,314
So do I.

3
00:04:26,983 --> 00:04:31,249
Mahler, The Drifters,
The Mello-Kings, Bach.

4
00:04:33,056 --> 00:04:36,514
- What are you thinking?
- That you're a horrible driver.

5
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,992
What're you talking about?
I'm a terrific driver.

6
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:44,633
This car is part of my body.
It's an extension of my...

7
00:04:56,813 --> 00:05:00,010
- Hope you got insurance, buddy.
- Uh, yeah.

8
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:04,585
You're going to need it. Give me
your license and registration.

9
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:24,529
Okay, that's it.

10
00:05:35,218 --> 00:05:39,587
- You're as crazy as I am.
- You're not crazy. You're just scared.

11
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,153
Why did you say that?

12
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:45,593
You're shaking.

13
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:51,166
What's your name?

14
00:05:52,035 --> 00:05:56,836
Mine is Jimmy.
What are you looking away for?

15
00:06:04,747 --> 00:06:06,112
Yeah.

16
00:06:10,887 --> 00:06:12,377
Yeah.

17
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,922
Would you like some wine?

18
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,810
What are you doing?

19
00:10:07,323 --> 00:10:09,450
Don't keep doing that.

20
00:10:10,126 --> 00:10:13,857
Don't you understand?
I'll bring you into dreams of yourself.

21
00:10:14,063 --> 00:10:16,657
All you have to do
is believe in me.

22
00:10:19,135 --> 00:10:22,036
- What?
- You're so full of shit.

23
00:10:22,238 --> 00:10:24,138
No, I mean it.

24
00:10:26,642 --> 00:10:27,939
I do.

25
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,790
Carol.

26
00:10:57,606 --> 00:11:00,541
- Carol what?
- Just Carol.

27
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:19,060
Listen, let me...
Let me ask you a question.

28
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,096
- If you didn't want to...
- I did.

29
00:12:44,146 --> 00:12:48,082
- Do we have to have this noise on?
- That's the Chiffons, Dad.

30
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,742
Where's the Jerry Vale tape
I got you for Christmas?

31
00:12:51,954 --> 00:12:55,913
- I'm meeting you for lunch, right?
- Well, put it on.

32
00:12:56,392 --> 00:13:00,692
I never understand you.
Either it's a 900-year-old kraut...

33
00:13:00,896 --> 00:13:03,831
...or five niggers
with squeaky voices.

34
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:07,525
Now that Jerry Vale could be
singing La Scala.

35
00:13:07,736 --> 00:13:12,571
- You going to say it's not beautiful?
- Why don't you stop smoking?

36
00:13:12,808 --> 00:13:16,608
I'll stop smoking
when you stop fucking.

37
00:13:17,012 --> 00:13:20,573
Want a suit like this?
I'll have one made for you.

38
00:13:20,783 --> 00:13:25,083
- No, thanks. Yellow doesn't...
- What are you talking about yellow?

39
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:28,948
- The guy sold it to me for cream.
- Cream?

40
00:13:29,191 --> 00:13:34,561
- What's the matter? You got the crabs?
- No. I don't know. My dick's hurting.

41
00:13:34,763 --> 00:13:37,891
Of course your dick's hurting,
it's a conspiracy.

42
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,365
- What?
- Women. They bust your balls.

43
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:46,769
The day a woman loses her virginity,
she's a whore. They're all whores.

44
00:13:46,976 --> 00:13:49,536
- Except this girl, Anita.
- What Anita?

45
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:53,806
- This girl I'm thinking of marrying.
- Marrying?

46
00:13:54,016 --> 00:13:58,544
- Anita O'Hallahan, O'Hallaran.
- Anita what?

47
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:04,192
O'Hallaran. It's Irish.
But she's a goddess.

48
00:14:04,493 --> 00:14:10,557
She's got a body that won't stop.
Big blue eyes, beautiful red hair...

49
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,758
...tits like balloons.
You wouldn't believe it.

50
00:14:13,969 --> 00:14:17,530
- You have to marry her?
- I ain't old enough to marry?

51
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,675
Do you mind?
If you did, I wouldn't do it.

52
00:14:20,876 --> 00:14:24,004
- Do what you like.
- If you mind, I won't do it.

53
00:14:24,213 --> 00:14:29,583
- Do what makes you happy.
- You stick to that, you won't go wrong.

54
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:33,716
Jimmy, how's your time for
the next few days?

55
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,256
- I don't know. I have...
- A couple hours, that's all I need.

56
00:14:43,165 --> 00:14:47,067
- For what?
- I got two collections for you to do.

57
00:14:47,836 --> 00:14:51,704
This guy, Luchino, runs a pizza joint
on Bleeker Street.

58
00:14:51,907 --> 00:14:55,138
He's into me for 4000
for three months.

59
00:14:55,344 --> 00:14:59,940
And he keeps crying he's tapped out.
And that's bullshit.

60
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:03,118
The motherfucker bought a house
in Long Beach.

61
00:15:03,552 --> 00:15:05,782
What are you looking at?

62
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:09,947
Your eyes keep jumping around
like a sea gull.

63
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,992
- Ben, I hate to bother you but...
- Sammy, Sammy...

64
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:16,393
...you'd find me in the middle
of the Sahara Desert.

65
00:15:16,565 --> 00:15:17,623
How much?

66
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:21,701
- I need 500 until Wednesday.
- I'll give you 3.

67
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:25,738
Come on, Ben. I promise you,
I swear you'll get it on time.

68
00:15:25,908 --> 00:15:27,808
Take the 5, take the 5.

69
00:15:27,977 --> 00:15:30,878
But don't be late
in paying me, understand?

70
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,607
- Absolutely. Thanks. I appreciate it.
- Get lost.

71
00:15:34,817 --> 00:15:38,344
Say hello to Helen and the kids
for me, will you?

72
00:15:38,554 --> 00:15:43,014
Look, this other guy could be
more of a problem.

73
00:15:43,225 --> 00:15:45,955
Patsy Riccamonza from Detroit.

74
00:15:46,228 --> 00:15:51,131
He's a dealer, messes with colored
operations, gambling, narcotics.

75
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:53,301
So I had Riccamonza checked.

76
00:15:53,502 --> 00:15:56,198
People in Detroit tell me
he's legit.

77
00:15:56,405 --> 00:15:59,397
- So?
- I let him play some figures on credit.

78
00:15:59,608 --> 00:16:01,405
- How much?
- 22,000.

79
00:16:02,077 --> 00:16:07,538
- You let him play 22,000 on credit?
- I just told you. I had him checked.

80
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:11,208
I go to this Excelsior health club
where he hangs out.

81
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:14,947
One of these two guys with him
pulls a pistol on me...

82
00:16:15,157 --> 00:16:18,991
...and sticks it in my ear, and says,
"Don't come back.

83
00:16:19,194 --> 00:16:22,960
The man doesn't want to be bothered."
Can you believe it?

84
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:25,931
He sticks a pistol in my ear.

85
00:16:26,135 --> 00:16:31,266
Now, the next day, I run into this
midget dwarf, Flash.

86
00:16:31,473 --> 00:16:34,442
He tells me that
Riccamonza's going...

87
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:40,776
Riccamonza, that motherless,
rat-faced scumbag he is...

88
00:16:40,983 --> 00:16:45,044
...he's going around town telling
everybody he's stiffing me.

89
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:49,281
And if I make any problem,
he's going to have me popped.

90
00:16:49,491 --> 00:16:52,551
Going to have me popped.
There's his ticket.

91
00:16:57,132 --> 00:16:59,066
He likes playing favorites.

92
00:16:59,468 --> 00:17:03,700
I don't give a fuck what he likes,
he don't pay when he loses.

93
00:17:03,906 --> 00:17:06,568
Now you keep it. Keep it.

94
00:17:08,644 --> 00:17:11,943
He must think you don't
have too many people working.

95
00:17:12,147 --> 00:17:15,708
What "too many people," Jimmy?
I got nobody.

96
00:17:15,918 --> 00:17:17,249
I got you.

97
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:25,017
All right, forget about it, huh?
Just forget it.

98
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:30,425
I'll bust his head myself
with a crowbar. Just forget about it.

99
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:35,899
- How's that music thing going?
- Good.

100
00:17:36,105 --> 00:17:39,370
What the hell is the matter?
You're so fidgety.

101
00:17:39,575 --> 00:17:43,875
Nothing. I'm just thinking
about something.

102
00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:49,173
Remember that impresario, Arthur Fox,
that used to promote Mom's concerts?

103
00:17:49,384 --> 00:17:51,978
- Thin guy?
- I audition with him Friday.

104
00:17:52,187 --> 00:17:56,180
- That's terrific. You tell your mother?
- Yeah, she knows.

105
00:17:56,391 --> 00:17:59,622
You're gonna be big,
there's no question about it.

106
00:17:59,795 --> 00:18:01,262
No question about it.

107
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:05,457
Most guys who become concert pianists
are performing by 10.

108
00:18:05,768 --> 00:18:08,703
It's like anything else in life.

109
00:18:08,904 --> 00:18:12,340
If you know you can do it,
you'll do it.

110
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:14,475
It's just like collecting.

111
00:18:15,711 --> 00:18:20,580
Hi, baby. What did I tell you?
Isn't she gorgeous?

112
00:18:20,783 --> 00:18:24,742
Say hello to my son, Jimmy.
Jimmy, this is Anita O'Hallaran.

113
00:18:24,953 --> 00:18:29,014
- O'Hallahan, hi.
- O'Hallahan. Let me get you a chair.

114
00:18:29,992 --> 00:18:31,960
- Guess what?
- What happened?

115
00:18:32,161 --> 00:18:34,789
- I got the job.
- That's terrific.

116
00:18:34,997 --> 00:18:38,592
Carmine. Bring me another bottle
of that champagne.

117
00:18:38,801 --> 00:18:39,890
What job?

118
00:18:40,002 --> 00:18:43,438
Angel Magazine is making me
their queen for April.

119
00:18:43,639 --> 00:18:44,765
Oh, yeah?

120
00:18:46,175 --> 00:18:50,271
Your father says you were
the best collector in New York.

121
00:18:50,479 --> 00:18:52,879
Ben, you're wanted
on the telephone.

122
00:18:53,081 --> 00:18:56,482
I'll be right back, huh?
You hold the fort.

123
00:18:56,985 --> 00:19:00,921
Say something nice about me
while I'm gone.

124
00:19:01,123 --> 00:19:04,183
- He's a sweet old man.
- He's 57.

125
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,826
And how old are you?

126
00:19:06,361 --> 00:19:10,798
- 32.
- I'm 19. So to us, he's an old man.

127
00:19:14,803 --> 00:19:16,430
You have pretty eyes.

128
00:19:17,973 --> 00:19:22,569
No matter what this kid said about me,
believe me, it's not true.

129
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:24,006
Nobody's got...

130
00:19:24,546 --> 00:19:28,915
Son of a bitch.
There's not a drop on you.

131
00:19:29,117 --> 00:19:34,248
- Oh, my God. Look who's here. Excuse me.
- Sorry.

132
00:19:34,456 --> 00:19:38,483
Jimmy, what do you think?
What do you think?

133
00:19:39,127 --> 00:19:43,188
- You're going to marry her, not me.
- But what do you think?

134
00:19:43,398 --> 00:19:46,799
What do I think?
I think she's a lowlife.

135
00:19:47,002 --> 00:19:51,336
What's the matter? Just because
she poses for a nude magazine?

136
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:54,202
Everybody does that nowadays.

137
00:19:56,011 --> 00:19:58,741
Hey, where you going?

138
00:19:58,914 --> 00:20:00,677
Hey, Jimmy.

139
00:20:40,188 --> 00:20:43,453
Come on. Make up your mind.
What do you want?

140
00:21:33,842 --> 00:21:36,072
Hey, hey, radio.

141
00:21:36,912 --> 00:21:39,813
You don't got a quarter
for the jukebox?

142
00:21:40,315 --> 00:21:41,339
You Luchino?

143
00:21:42,484 --> 00:21:43,573
Yeah. So what?

144
00:21:43,752 --> 00:21:47,244
I need to talk to you.
You have a moment?

145
00:21:47,456 --> 00:21:48,582
Turn that off.

146
00:21:49,424 --> 00:21:50,789
I like this song.

147
00:21:51,326 --> 00:21:55,820
- Then take it outside.
- What if I want a slice of pizza?

148
00:21:56,164 --> 00:21:59,429
Can't read the signs?
We don't sell slices.

149
00:21:59,634 --> 00:22:01,693
What if I wanted 60 slices?

150
00:22:02,004 --> 00:22:07,704
You deaf? No slice pizza.
Take it on the outside.

151
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:13,543
Come here a minute. I have something
private I want to say to you.

152
00:22:13,882 --> 00:22:15,645
Whoa, whoa.

153
00:22:16,051 --> 00:22:19,919
- Whoa, whoa.
- Listen, you owe Ben Angellelli $4000.

154
00:22:20,122 --> 00:22:22,989
You tell Ben Angellelli
to suck my cock.

155
00:22:23,191 --> 00:22:26,092
You lost the money.
You should pay your debts.

156
00:22:26,294 --> 00:22:28,125
A double suck.

157
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:40,467
- Dad!
- Get over there. Get the fuck over there.

158
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:48,477
You don't like what I did to your
father? You don't like it?

159
00:22:48,683 --> 00:22:51,345
Well, I don't like what he did
to my father.

160
00:25:57,138 --> 00:26:01,905
- Jimmy. Hey, what's this?
- Pizza money.

161
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:05,671
No shit? So fast?
Jesus, you're terrific, kid.

162
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,178
- He give you any trouble?
- You kidding?

163
00:26:08,383 --> 00:26:11,784
I said, "Next time my old
man is coming, got it?"

164
00:26:12,387 --> 00:26:15,254
- What did he say?
- He gave me the money.

165
00:26:15,457 --> 00:26:16,822
- Get out.
- I swear.

166
00:26:17,025 --> 00:26:20,688
You said, "The old man is coming,"
and he gave it up?

167
00:26:20,895 --> 00:26:23,261
- I swear.
- No shit.

168
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:10,504
Waiter? Tell this character
to turn his radio off.

169
00:27:11,446 --> 00:27:14,210
What are you telling him for?
Tell me.

170
00:27:15,016 --> 00:27:17,814
All right. I'm telling you,
turn it off.

171
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,044
Do you believe this?

172
00:27:20,255 --> 00:27:25,454
This is "Summertime, Summertime."
The most inventive song of 1958.

173
00:27:25,627 --> 00:27:29,791
Are you going to tell me this song
doesn't go with your shrimp?

174
00:27:30,665 --> 00:27:31,754
You...

175
00:27:36,171 --> 00:27:38,833
You hit my son and...!

176
00:27:49,351 --> 00:27:52,218
Come on. Take it easy. Relax.

177
00:27:52,887 --> 00:27:57,984
You guys keep your mouth shut and mind
your own business about the radio.

178
00:27:58,493 --> 00:28:00,654
Relax. It's lunchtime.

179
00:28:19,381 --> 00:28:21,941
Don't you ever touch me again,
you cunt.

180
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:26,315
I'll cut your fucking lips off,
you cocksucker!

181
00:28:33,995 --> 00:28:38,659
That was a stupid thing, with your audition
coming up, risking a fight.

182
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:40,858
You could've broken both hands.

183
00:28:41,069 --> 00:28:43,867
- Yeah, I know.
- Why did you do it?

184
00:28:44,072 --> 00:28:45,972
I didn't do it. I just...

185
00:28:46,174 --> 00:28:49,632
You were looking to do it,
you fucking idiot.

186
00:28:49,844 --> 00:28:53,439
What do you say that for?
Why do you put me down?

187
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:57,584
This is ridiculous, this music box.
That's for kids.

188
00:28:57,786 --> 00:29:01,313
It's my tape. Do you want me
to go nuts? I have to...

189
00:29:01,523 --> 00:29:03,548
- You are nuts.
- Don't say that.

190
00:29:03,758 --> 00:29:07,888
Who ever heard of anybody playing
"Summertime, Summertime"...

191
00:29:08,096 --> 00:29:11,554
...when it's 15 fucking
degrees below zero.

192
00:29:11,766 --> 00:29:14,291
How you handling this
Riccamonza thing?

193
00:29:14,469 --> 00:29:18,428
I haven't moved on him yet.
Been practicing. Audition's Friday.

194
00:29:18,606 --> 00:29:23,270
He's badmouthing me. He's telling
everybody how he's stiffing me.

195
00:29:23,478 --> 00:29:25,673
- I'll take care of it.
- When?

196
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:31,512
- What is it? What is it?
- It's all right. It's all right.

197
00:29:31,719 --> 00:29:34,688
I get dizzy once in a while,
that's all.

198
00:29:34,889 --> 00:29:40,293
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Why? You a surgery expert? Here.

199
00:29:40,462 --> 00:29:43,397
- What's that?
- Your share of the pizza money.

200
00:29:43,598 --> 00:29:46,624
- I don't want it.
- It's $ 1000.

201
00:30:12,093 --> 00:30:14,721
Excuse me.
Is Patsy Riccamonza around?

202
00:30:14,929 --> 00:30:17,830
- I don't know.
- Thank you.

203
00:30:31,446 --> 00:30:36,008
- Excuse me, is Patsy Riccamonza around?
- I think he's out by the pool.

204
00:30:36,217 --> 00:30:37,377
Thank you.

205
00:31:04,379 --> 00:31:06,677
Will you page Patsy Riccamonza?

206
00:31:06,881 --> 00:31:09,111
May I have a tea with lemon?

207
00:31:09,317 --> 00:31:10,545
Yes, sir.

208
00:31:28,069 --> 00:31:30,230
Patsy Riccamonza?

209
00:31:32,106 --> 00:31:37,203
I'm calling in reference to a financial
obligation you have to Ben Angellelli.

210
00:31:37,845 --> 00:31:40,814
That's none of your business.

211
00:31:41,015 --> 00:31:44,178
Now look, you cheap,
rotten chiseler.

212
00:31:44,385 --> 00:31:46,853
You have every cent
of that $22,000...

213
00:31:47,055 --> 00:31:52,357
...3:00 tomorrow, the 57th Street Park,
or I'll blow your eyes out, got it?

214
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:56,528
I understand you got a bad mouth,
fella. You need to close it.

215
00:31:57,131 --> 00:32:00,066
We'll see about that.
You just be there.

216
00:32:04,105 --> 00:32:07,973
- You gonna be back later?
- Yeah.

217
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:11,339
You be good or
I'll break your face.

218
00:32:11,546 --> 00:32:14,310
- He means it.
- I'm tough.

219
00:33:59,253 --> 00:34:02,484
Excuse me.
I got a phone call this morning.

220
00:34:02,657 --> 00:34:06,787
A voice said to come here
and look for a girl on the phone.

221
00:34:06,994 --> 00:34:12,990
She'll be the girl of your dreams.
5'5", dark hair, blue eyes.

222
00:34:13,201 --> 00:34:16,398
She's wearing
a dusty rose bikini...

223
00:34:16,604 --> 00:34:20,506
...and her name is Julie.

224
00:34:20,742 --> 00:34:24,838
Well, you made a mistake.
I'm 5'6".

225
00:34:25,046 --> 00:34:29,107
How could I make a mistake
when they're playing our song?

226
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,684
Why not rehearse
this somewhere else?

227
00:34:32,887 --> 00:34:35,219
Because I want it from you.

228
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:39,593
- Want what?
- Love.

229
00:34:40,228 --> 00:34:43,220
Why? Do you love me?

230
00:34:43,798 --> 00:34:47,757
No, I'm in love with a girl
called Carol. I love your...

231
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:51,061
My what?

232
00:34:51,939 --> 00:34:53,873
Your pussy.

233
00:34:56,711 --> 00:34:58,736
How do you know that?

234
00:34:58,946 --> 00:35:02,211
Of all the different
kinds of pussy...

235
00:35:02,416 --> 00:35:06,375
...soft, hot, gravel, velvet,
cold, wet, big, small...

236
00:35:06,587 --> 00:35:12,389
...there's one I can feel in my blood,
and that's silk, which is yours.

237
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,770
What are you doing?

238
00:35:27,975 --> 00:35:30,876
Are you out of your mind?

239
00:35:37,185 --> 00:35:39,619
I have a sunburn.

240
00:35:40,822 --> 00:35:43,188
You're crazy.

241
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:32,132
You gonna tell your
old man about this?

242
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,031
What old man?

243
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:37,202
Patsy.

244
00:36:39,747 --> 00:36:41,738
Who are you?

245
00:36:42,083 --> 00:36:46,782
Jimmy Angellelli. Tell him.

246
00:36:49,223 --> 00:36:53,660
It's nothing against you.
You are silk.

247
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:37,497
Hey.

248
00:37:38,139 --> 00:37:39,766
What's the matter?

249
00:37:39,974 --> 00:37:42,772
Come on, it's not that bad.

250
00:37:43,377 --> 00:37:46,244
What's the worst that
could happen? Death?

251
00:37:46,447 --> 00:37:49,348
So what? Everything
that ever lived dies.

252
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:53,816
Think if you were going bald.
That's something to cry about.

253
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:57,388
Even then, you can get
a transplant.

254
00:37:57,591 --> 00:38:00,059
- What's your name?
- Esther.

255
00:38:00,261 --> 00:38:03,560
- No kidding, so is mine!
- It is not.

256
00:38:03,764 --> 00:38:07,666
It's not my real name.
Shirley is my real name.

257
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:11,235
You should be ashamed,
carrying on like this...

258
00:38:11,439 --> 00:38:15,398
...with a horny kid like me
falling in love with you.

259
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:19,746
You're putting evil thoughts
in my mind, Esther.

260
00:38:27,788 --> 00:38:31,315
Relax. All I'm gonna do
is slip a finger in.

261
00:38:31,525 --> 00:38:37,555
- Why's your glove up to your elbow?
- My arm's cold. Turn around, bend over.

262
00:38:41,869 --> 00:38:44,929
Bend over and point your toes in.

263
00:38:45,139 --> 00:38:47,266
- Like this?
- In.

264
00:38:47,475 --> 00:38:50,444
Now take a deep breath
and hold it.

265
00:38:57,351 --> 00:38:59,512
All right.

266
00:39:02,023 --> 00:39:05,424
- All right! All right!
- All right, all right.

267
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,584
All right!

268
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:11,496
Here it comes. Okay...

269
00:39:12,533 --> 00:39:14,626
All right.

270
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,531
The golden rule of urology:

271
00:39:21,742 --> 00:39:26,941
If you get an erection, you come.
If you don't get an erection, you walk.

272
00:39:28,215 --> 00:39:29,807
Yeah?

273
00:39:31,385 --> 00:39:33,580
What about heroic fucks?

274
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,688
What's that?

275
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:41,117
You're ready to come,
but the girl needs more.

276
00:39:41,762 --> 00:39:45,823
She's gonna cry inside
if you shoot it all out...

277
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:50,237
...so you do your razor-blade
fantasies and hold back.

278
00:39:51,405 --> 00:39:57,366
That's a dumb fuck, not a heroic fuck.
You're straining your prostrate glands.

279
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,109
Make up your mind.

280
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:03,773
Whose penis are we talking about here?
Yours or hers?

281
00:41:28,502 --> 00:41:31,801
- Hey, beautiful, where you going?
- To have fun.

282
00:41:32,006 --> 00:41:37,308
- Come with me and have some more fun.
- You're sure of yourself, aren't you?

283
00:41:37,511 --> 00:41:39,035
That's right.

284
00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:48,288
You're in the way of traffic.

285
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,264
Hey! Looking good.

286
00:44:29,149 --> 00:44:31,083
I got it.

287
00:44:53,407 --> 00:44:55,534
- Where is it?
- Where's what?

288
00:44:55,743 --> 00:44:58,268
The $22,000 your man lost.

289
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:03,007
I don't know nothing about no 22,000
nothing, but we got us a message.

290
00:45:03,183 --> 00:45:06,084
Patsy didn't care
for your tone of voice.

291
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:08,914
He don't want you
bothering him again.

292
00:45:09,089 --> 00:45:12,616
Maybe if I shot you two douche bags
he'd reconsider.

293
00:45:12,826 --> 00:45:15,556
You gonna shoot us
with your radio?

294
00:45:15,763 --> 00:45:17,822
- Hey, you wear shoes.
- Yeah.

295
00:45:18,031 --> 00:45:20,727
- I'm surprised.
- Hey, officer!

296
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,367
- What?
- Your loss.

297
00:45:22,569 --> 00:45:28,371
We're standing here, bothering nobody.
This maniac starts threatening us.

298
00:45:28,575 --> 00:45:31,066
- Get out of here!
- Blow off our legs.

299
00:45:31,512 --> 00:45:37,109
And he's flashing illegal gambling.
In his hand, look.

300
00:45:39,253 --> 00:45:43,451
Is this your handwriting?
Is this your handwriting?

301
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:47,149
- Yeah.
- Come on. What's your name?

302
00:45:47,361 --> 00:45:49,454
- Jimmy Angellelli.
- Let's move.

303
00:45:49,963 --> 00:45:53,126
- What's yours?
- What do you mean, "What's mine?"

304
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:55,927
Officer Morris Levy. That's mine.

305
00:45:56,136 --> 00:45:59,264
You're a Levite?
So am I. We're brothers.

306
00:45:59,473 --> 00:46:03,102
- With a name like Angellelli?
- My mother's a Levine.

307
00:46:03,310 --> 00:46:04,937
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

308
00:46:05,145 --> 00:46:08,546
- My mother's maiden name is DeLucci.
- Really?

309
00:46:08,749 --> 00:46:11,183
DeLucci, Angellelli.
Levy, Levine.

310
00:46:11,385 --> 00:46:13,285
We're brothers. We're twins.

311
00:46:13,487 --> 00:46:17,423
Look, I wear a chai
on my Saint Christopher's medal.

312
00:46:17,624 --> 00:46:21,492
- That's no excuse for this.
- Forget it, it's nothing.

313
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:25,654
You shouldn't waste your time
with law enforcement.

314
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:28,300
You're a sensitive guy.
Look at your eyes.

315
00:46:28,502 --> 00:46:34,065
You should be out listening
to Shostakovich and The Drifters.

316
00:46:34,274 --> 00:46:35,673
It'll keep you sane.

317
00:46:35,843 --> 00:46:38,937
I'm not worried about my sanity.
Let's go.

318
00:46:39,112 --> 00:46:42,013
You're lucky.
You're not gonna arrest me.

319
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:44,116
I got to. You're in...

320
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:47,378
- I have an audition tomorrow!
- What audition?

321
00:46:47,588 --> 00:46:51,285
- For a recital at Carnegie Hall.
- What recital?

322
00:46:51,458 --> 00:46:56,395
I'm a pianist. It's with Arthur Fox,
the biggest impresario in New York.

323
00:46:56,563 --> 00:47:00,124
Today is the day before the most
important day of my life.

324
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:04,066
Then what were you doing
collecting this gambling shit for?

325
00:47:04,271 --> 00:47:07,638
I don't know.
It's just not that easy...

326
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:13,437
It's just not that
easy to explain.

327
00:47:14,615 --> 00:47:18,984
Swear to God, I'll never do it again.
Come on, give me a break.

328
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:23,349
The Arabs want to bury us.
The French want to bury us.

329
00:47:23,557 --> 00:47:28,119
Everybody wants to bury us.
We gotta take care of each other.

330
00:47:28,328 --> 00:47:31,923
I know you're not gonna
do this to me.

331
00:47:33,166 --> 00:47:37,034
Three guys are in the desert,
an Italian, Irishman and Polack.

332
00:47:37,237 --> 00:47:40,673
The Italian has gorgonzola,
the mick has a beer...

333
00:47:40,874 --> 00:47:44,310
...and the Polack is carrying
a car door.

334
00:47:44,511 --> 00:47:46,342
So they run into an Arab...

335
00:47:46,547 --> 00:47:49,880
Why don't you shut your ass
and go to sleep.

336
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:54,077
- Who's talking to you, asshole?
- I'm talking to you, sucker.

337
00:47:54,254 --> 00:47:57,314
All you're doing is sitting
in your dry piss.

338
00:47:57,491 --> 00:48:00,016
- Who's piss?
- I don't see anybody else.

339
00:48:00,227 --> 00:48:03,628
What about me? You don't see me?

340
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:06,731
You a human being?
You're a fucking animal.

341
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:09,630
I'll kick your wop ass,
you'll see me.

342
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:14,103
You couldn't kick my sister's ass,
and she's in a wheelchair in Daytona.

343
00:48:14,274 --> 00:48:18,768
- You got a sister in Daytona?
- You want to make something of it?

344
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:23,382
- No, I got a sister in Daytona too.
- Yeah? No shit.

345
00:48:23,584 --> 00:48:25,518
You bet your Jew ass I do.

346
00:48:25,686 --> 00:48:28,553
I'm not a Jew, you motherfucker!

347
00:48:28,722 --> 00:48:30,622
- Listen!
- Fucking asshole!

348
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:32,985
Instead of talking philosophy...

349
00:48:33,193 --> 00:48:37,596
...why don't you let me sing
some Bach, all right?

350
00:48:37,798 --> 00:48:41,234
- You a vocalist?
- Pianist. Listen.

351
00:49:13,166 --> 00:49:15,327
Appear in court March 10th.

352
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:18,333
Six months is the most
you could get...

353
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:21,439
...and they'll probably drop it.

354
00:49:24,444 --> 00:49:28,972
- I'll pay you back tomorrow.
- Your dad already took care of it.

355
00:49:29,916 --> 00:49:32,885
- May I use your phone?
- No.

356
00:50:33,346 --> 00:50:35,610
Hello?

357
00:50:44,658 --> 00:50:46,455
Hello?!

358
00:51:53,725 --> 00:51:55,158
Bravo.

359
00:52:08,206 --> 00:52:10,197
Jimmy Angellelli.

360
00:52:11,309 --> 00:52:13,004
Okay.

361
00:52:16,114 --> 00:52:19,413
Mr. Fox, Mr. Angellelli.

362
00:52:30,028 --> 00:52:32,360
- Jimmy.
- Mr. Fox.

363
00:52:32,564 --> 00:52:35,533
Last I saw you,
you came up to my tie.

364
00:52:35,734 --> 00:52:40,068
- I'm still short for my age.
- Tall enough, and very handsome.

365
00:52:40,272 --> 00:52:46,268
- Now all I have to do is play well.
- You will. I have a good feeling.

366
00:52:46,778 --> 00:52:50,009
- How's your mother?
- Fine, thank you.

367
00:52:50,348 --> 00:52:52,509
- You're doing a toccata?
- Yes.

368
00:52:52,717 --> 00:52:56,153
- Do you mind starting with a fugue?
- Fine.

369
00:54:04,389 --> 00:54:07,950
- Would you like to begin again?
- Yes.

370
00:54:51,970 --> 00:54:55,235
I tell you, Jimmy, why don't you
call me when you're ready.

371
00:54:55,407 --> 00:54:56,874
I am ready.

372
00:54:57,676 --> 00:54:59,837
I can play this piece.

373
00:55:04,216 --> 00:55:07,344
Excuse me. I play it
all the time. Perfectly.

374
00:55:07,552 --> 00:55:09,611
I don't understand it.

375
00:55:11,289 --> 00:55:13,348
Something's happening to me.

376
00:55:13,558 --> 00:55:18,018
I play this piece better
than anybody alive, Mr. Fox.

377
00:55:53,198 --> 00:55:54,688
I'm sorry.

378
00:56:23,962 --> 00:56:25,793
Hi, Ma.

379
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,100
How are you feeling?

380
00:56:31,303 --> 00:56:34,568
- Listen, I...
- I don't want to hear it.

381
00:56:35,707 --> 00:56:37,368
What?

382
00:56:37,842 --> 00:56:41,471
Whatever it is you plan
to hurt me with.

383
00:56:43,615 --> 00:56:47,847
- I'm not going to hurt you, Mom. I...
- Don't I get a kiss?

384
00:56:50,121 --> 00:56:53,750
- Mom, listen...
- You call that a kiss?

385
00:56:59,764 --> 00:57:01,698
Tell me.

386
00:57:03,101 --> 00:57:06,764
I had that audition
with Arthur Fox today.

387
00:57:07,372 --> 00:57:10,136
It didn't work out.

388
00:57:24,622 --> 00:57:26,146
I'm sorry.

389
00:57:27,659 --> 00:57:29,923
It's just too late.

390
00:57:36,901 --> 00:57:41,429
I can play anything when I'm alone,
but when there are people...

391
00:57:41,639 --> 00:57:46,133
I can't seem to relax.
My hands don't work right.

392
00:57:46,344 --> 00:57:49,211
My mind starts interfering.

393
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:54,309
Can you understand that, Ma?

394
00:57:55,587 --> 00:57:57,487
Ma?

395
00:58:01,826 --> 00:58:03,054
Ma.

396
00:58:07,932 --> 00:58:09,422
Don't...

397
00:59:11,563 --> 00:59:13,963
I can't see you now.

398
00:59:14,999 --> 00:59:17,399
You can't see me now?

399
00:59:17,902 --> 00:59:20,268
I told you...

400
00:59:34,285 --> 00:59:35,809
All right.

401
00:59:49,033 --> 00:59:50,660
I can't.

402
00:59:52,537 --> 00:59:55,563
I fucking need you to want me.

403
00:59:58,343 --> 01:00:00,811
If you don't want me, I just...

404
01:00:00,979 --> 01:00:03,504
I fucking can't do anything.

405
01:00:59,804 --> 01:01:01,431
You wearing a diaphragm?

406
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,537
- Yeah.
- Take it out.

407
01:01:03,708 --> 01:01:05,573
- I can't.
- Take it out.

408
01:01:06,744 --> 01:01:09,212
- I can't.
- Take it out.

409
01:01:09,981 --> 01:01:11,812
Take it out.

410
01:01:14,452 --> 01:01:16,352
Take it out.

411
01:02:03,201 --> 01:02:04,691
Yes!

412
01:02:05,637 --> 01:02:08,197
Damn it, now!

413
01:02:34,999 --> 01:02:37,194
Bad dream?

414
01:02:47,412 --> 01:02:48,902
What?

415
01:02:52,417 --> 01:02:55,511
- What are you doing?
- I have to go out.

416
01:02:59,857 --> 01:03:03,190
- I want you to stay.
- I can't.

417
01:03:06,597 --> 01:03:10,795
- Don't you understand?
- Understand what?

418
01:03:10,968 --> 01:03:15,632
What's here.
Just what's there between us.

419
01:03:17,675 --> 01:03:19,165
You know.

420
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:24,011
Why are you doing this?

421
01:03:24,182 --> 01:03:27,709
I'm not doing anything.
I just want you to leave.

422
01:03:28,152 --> 01:03:31,246
Why the fuck are you doing this?

423
01:04:45,730 --> 01:04:47,925
Do you have an old man?

424
01:05:01,279 --> 01:05:05,545
- What about the baby we just made?
- What do you wanna do with it?

425
01:05:09,754 --> 01:05:11,415
You can't come with me.

426
01:05:30,575 --> 01:05:34,306
- Carol just walked in with someone.
- Oh, yeah?

427
01:05:34,478 --> 01:05:38,141
She's pretty. I didn't know
she looked like that.

428
01:05:43,087 --> 01:05:47,990
- You're about 12 hours late, ain't you?
- Do you want me to leave?

429
01:05:48,259 --> 01:05:51,228
If I wanted you to leave,
I'd tell you.

430
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:54,760
You girls wait up here.

431
01:06:09,247 --> 01:06:11,147
Who's your buddy?

432
01:06:12,383 --> 01:06:14,010
Jimmy.

433
01:06:14,752 --> 01:06:16,947
Why's he looking at me like that?

434
01:06:17,121 --> 01:06:20,579
I saw you fight Franky Delcenzo
when I was 10.

435
01:06:20,992 --> 01:06:24,484
Women used to come just to see him
with his shirt off.

436
01:06:24,662 --> 01:06:28,598
I wouldn't know about that, dude.
A lot of guys came too.

437
01:06:28,766 --> 01:06:33,100
He used to lay back.
You see, like... Just like that.

438
01:06:33,271 --> 01:06:38,903
When a guy moved in on him
to put him away... Forget about it.

439
01:06:39,443 --> 01:06:41,934
- I like your combination.
- Yeah?

440
01:06:42,113 --> 01:06:44,411
Well, I like your girlfriend.

441
01:06:44,582 --> 01:06:46,447
She must like you too, dude.

442
01:06:46,651 --> 01:06:49,916
- But she only likes me, she loves you.
- Shut up.

443
01:06:53,357 --> 01:06:57,521
- Who you smiling at, my man?
- Carol. You.

444
01:06:59,096 --> 01:07:01,792
You invite him down here?

445
01:07:02,033 --> 01:07:03,967
Then why is he here?

446
01:07:04,168 --> 01:07:06,398
I don't know.

447
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:10,864
Tell you what, dude.

448
01:07:11,342 --> 01:07:14,937
You're down here, right?
So you must like to party, right?

449
01:07:15,112 --> 01:07:19,173
Ain't nobody come into my club
that don't likes to party.

450
01:07:19,650 --> 01:07:22,084
I'm gonna do a thing for you.

451
01:07:22,253 --> 01:07:25,484
I got a sweet little girl
up at the Pierre Hotel.

452
01:07:25,656 --> 01:07:29,615
I mean she's smart,
and she is fine.

453
01:07:29,794 --> 01:07:36,029
She's got a tight, little, sweet ass.
A motherfucker, a freak.

454
01:07:36,367 --> 01:07:39,302
I mean, like, everybody's
a freak, right?

455
01:07:40,237 --> 01:07:42,705
Because she's a real freak.

456
01:07:42,873 --> 01:07:45,398
She enjoys her shit.

457
01:07:45,676 --> 01:07:49,476
I ain't even touched her myself.
I met her last night at a dance.

458
01:07:49,647 --> 01:07:54,175
She did a thing on me with her eyes.
I just knew.

459
01:07:54,352 --> 01:07:55,717
I mean, I could tell.

460
01:07:57,221 --> 01:08:00,657
You understand that? Huh?

461
01:08:03,094 --> 01:08:06,621
See, you're the motherfucker
that she'd really like.

462
01:08:06,797 --> 01:08:08,765
Know how I know?

463
01:08:08,933 --> 01:08:15,168
The cat she was with, her boyfriend,
I mean, he looked just like you.

464
01:08:15,873 --> 01:08:21,175
But he wasn't as cute as you, dude.
Can you dig it?

465
01:08:23,147 --> 01:08:27,049
Anyway, she's alone this morning.

466
01:08:27,218 --> 01:08:33,282
So why don't you come on and go up
with Carol and me. If you want to.

467
01:08:33,624 --> 01:08:35,990
Are you going?

468
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:40,563
Excuse me, Dreems.
Butch is here to see you.

469
01:09:49,366 --> 01:09:52,335
You love me? Huh?

470
01:09:52,503 --> 01:09:55,904
You love me? I'm your daddy?

471
01:10:02,346 --> 01:10:04,280
What you going to do, dude?

472
01:10:11,655 --> 01:10:13,646
Hi, baby, how you doing?

473
01:10:13,824 --> 01:10:15,758
- All right.
- Good.

474
01:10:21,799 --> 01:10:24,859
Did you expect me to come
without no surprises?

475
01:10:25,035 --> 01:10:27,026
I was hoping you'd come alone.

476
01:10:27,204 --> 01:10:32,733
Hey, we are alone. Whenever
we're together, baby, we're alone.

477
01:10:40,851 --> 01:10:44,218
I'd like you to meet
a friend of mine.

478
01:10:44,388 --> 01:10:48,688
Best friend in the world.
Carol, this is Christa.

479
01:10:48,859 --> 01:10:50,326
- Hi, Carol.
- Hi, Christa.

480
01:10:50,494 --> 01:10:52,257
Ain't she beautiful, baby?

481
01:10:52,429 --> 01:10:56,832
- Yeah, she is.
- Yeah, she is. She's from Minnesota.

482
01:10:57,001 --> 01:10:59,868
She rides horses
and owns a boutique.

483
01:11:00,037 --> 01:11:03,871
- You made that dress? It's very pretty.
- Thank you.

484
01:11:04,041 --> 01:11:10,037
- This is my main man, Jimmy.
- Hi, Jimmy.

485
01:11:10,247 --> 01:11:15,514
You ever seen two finer ladies
in one room before in your life?

486
01:11:17,555 --> 01:11:20,956
Loosen up, my man,
we're gonna party.

487
01:11:22,026 --> 01:11:25,291
Hey, baby, why don't you go
and bring him over.

488
01:11:27,164 --> 01:11:33,330
I mean, like, he's your friend, right?
I mean, you brought him to my club.

489
01:11:38,442 --> 01:11:40,967
She seems upset.

490
01:11:41,145 --> 01:11:44,842
Don't worry about it, she's all right.
How about you?

491
01:11:45,015 --> 01:11:47,142
Yeah? Good.

492
01:11:55,826 --> 01:11:58,386
You see, because...

493
01:11:58,562 --> 01:12:02,726
...I ain't going to do
nothing with you...

494
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:05,698
...or to you.

495
01:12:05,869 --> 01:12:08,235
It's not for you, baby.

496
01:12:09,373 --> 01:12:12,103
You're gonna become silky...

497
01:13:01,091 --> 01:13:05,084
Hey, dude, can't get
your thing together?

498
01:13:05,362 --> 01:13:08,991
It's cool, my man. Same thing
happened to me, you know?

499
01:13:09,166 --> 01:13:11,896
See, any motherfucker
tell you that...

500
01:13:12,069 --> 01:13:17,234
...in certain situations his dick
ain't worth a shit, is telling you lies.

501
01:13:19,276 --> 01:13:22,541
So you better get yourself
together, my man.

502
01:14:14,631 --> 01:14:16,462
Come here, baby.

503
01:14:28,278 --> 01:14:30,473
Oh, I like that.

504
01:14:37,187 --> 01:14:39,348
Kiss her.

505
01:14:41,492 --> 01:14:43,119
So sweet.

506
01:15:00,878 --> 01:15:03,244
Kiss her for your daddy.

507
01:15:03,447 --> 01:15:05,608
Kiss her for your daddy.

508
01:15:06,517 --> 01:15:10,078
It's okay, baby, kiss her.

509
01:15:13,056 --> 01:15:17,789
Come on, baby. Come on.
Kiss her for your daddy.

510
01:15:17,961 --> 01:15:21,761
Just touch it. Just touch it.
That's it.

511
01:15:23,267 --> 01:15:27,260
Hey. She doesn't want to, Dreems.

512
01:15:40,384 --> 01:15:42,545
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

513
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:46,180
Don't you ever cross me.

514
01:15:47,324 --> 01:15:49,690
We better get out
of here, Dreems.

515
01:17:38,235 --> 01:17:40,795
- Where have you been?
- How are you, Pop?

516
01:17:40,971 --> 01:17:45,408
I've been running around like a rat
in a crazy box looking for you.

517
01:17:45,809 --> 01:17:47,902
I was out.

518
01:17:48,078 --> 01:17:50,638
- Let me ask you a question.
- What?

519
01:17:51,148 --> 01:17:55,016
Ever since you were a kid,
did I ever break my word to you?

520
01:17:56,219 --> 01:17:57,447
No.

521
01:17:57,621 --> 01:18:01,022
You can't blame me if I expect
the same thing from you.

522
01:18:01,224 --> 01:18:04,660
I've been trying, Dad.
This guy isn't easy.

523
01:18:04,861 --> 01:18:06,294
Forget about easy!

524
01:18:06,463 --> 01:18:10,593
For chrissakes! If it was easy,
I could've hired some asshole.

525
01:18:10,767 --> 01:18:12,667
I called him, I...

526
01:18:12,903 --> 01:18:14,165
Get rid of him!

527
01:18:15,572 --> 01:18:17,301
I can't do that. I never...

528
01:18:17,474 --> 01:18:21,376
Never? Forget never. This is now.

529
01:18:22,245 --> 01:18:23,906
Dad, I...

530
01:18:24,081 --> 01:18:25,514
Listen.

531
01:18:26,350 --> 01:18:28,750
You look in my eyes.

532
01:18:31,188 --> 01:18:32,712
Look in my eyes!

533
01:18:32,923 --> 01:18:37,189
- This won't get your money back.
- Don't you talk down to me, Jimmy!

534
01:18:37,394 --> 01:18:39,089
You know goddamn well...

535
01:18:39,262 --> 01:18:42,163
...this is not about money!
- I can't.

536
01:18:42,366 --> 01:18:45,529
Are you looking to stick
your prick up my ass?

537
01:18:45,702 --> 01:18:50,730
- What are you talking that way for?
- That's what you're doing!

538
01:18:50,907 --> 01:18:54,673
Stop that, Dad!
Will you, please?

539
01:18:55,212 --> 01:18:56,645
Jimmy!

540
01:18:58,148 --> 01:19:02,141
You gotta do this thing for me.
Now I need you.

541
01:19:04,488 --> 01:19:07,651
- I can't.
- Can't?

542
01:19:10,961 --> 01:19:12,986
Not now.

543
01:19:14,131 --> 01:19:18,192
Not now? I should have
strangled you in your crib.

544
01:20:14,124 --> 01:20:16,922
- Hey, man, what the fuck you want?
- Her.

545
01:20:18,762 --> 01:20:21,663
Man, you don't even
understand her ass.

546
01:20:21,865 --> 01:20:26,325
I want you to come with me, Carol.
I want you to stay with me now.

547
01:20:26,903 --> 01:20:30,031
If you don't, I won't be able
to want you again.

548
01:20:34,177 --> 01:20:37,237
Well, give me a fucking answer!

549
01:20:49,259 --> 01:20:54,822
See how you are? See what you do, huh?
See what you do?

550
01:20:54,998 --> 01:20:57,558
You shouldn't do that shit.

551
01:21:17,754 --> 01:21:21,520
- Hello?
- Yeah, it's over. You got that?

552
01:21:21,691 --> 01:21:26,094
I said it's over. Just don't
try nothing and you won't get hurt.

553
01:21:27,030 --> 01:21:28,520
Hello?

554
01:22:16,613 --> 01:22:18,547
Dad.

555
01:22:20,450 --> 01:22:22,350
Dad?

556
01:22:30,260 --> 01:22:31,750
Dad!

557
01:24:49,399 --> 01:24:51,367
What's on your mind, pal?

558
01:25:23,299 --> 01:25:27,429
Look at it,
you fucking cocksucker!

559
01:25:29,339 --> 01:25:32,934
You wanna die?
You wanna fucking die?!
