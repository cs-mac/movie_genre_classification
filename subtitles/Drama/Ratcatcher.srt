1
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:32,949
For God's sake,
look at the state of my curtain.

2
00:01:36,898 --> 00:01:38,593
Look at you.

3
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:53,071
If I've told you once,
I've told you umpteen times.

4
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:56,309
Keep your trousers
tucked in your boots.

5
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,951
Ryan Quinn!

6
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,084
Are you listening to me?

7
00:02:05,193 --> 00:02:06,922
Come here.

8
00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:12,030
- Ma, can I go out and play?
- You can go out after.

9
00:02:12,834 --> 00:02:14,802
Ma, leave it. I'll do it.

10
00:02:15,837 --> 00:02:18,067
I look like a spaz
with them tucked in.

11
00:02:18,172 --> 00:02:21,266
You won't say that when you trip
and fall on your backside.

12
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,138
I look stupid.

13
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:25,178
You keep 'em tucked in.

14
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,710
Is your foot in?
- Yes.

15
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:32,919
I'll do it myself.

16
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:40,455
Ma, can I go out and play?

17
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:43,155
- No, you can't.
- Ma, where are you going?

18
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:46,029
Ma, can I go out and play, please?

19
00:02:46,434 --> 00:02:49,801
You're going to see your dad.
Don't you want to see your dad?

20
00:03:36,217 --> 00:03:38,242
James, what are you up to?

21
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:47,927
What are you doing?

22
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:51,797
You fucking bastard!

23
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,390
Did you shit yourself?

24
00:03:57,371 --> 00:04:00,135
I got you one there, huh?

25
00:04:01,976 --> 00:04:04,444
I think this is what I'm looking for.

26
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:56,552
- Hi, how you doing?
- Fine. How are you?

27
00:04:57,198 --> 00:04:59,462
- Just going to Susan's.
- Say hello for me.

28
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:01,501
See you later.

29
00:06:27,088 --> 00:06:29,215
I thought it was you.

30
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:03,518
To the little man.

31
00:07:07,228 --> 00:07:09,355
Get the fuck away from there!

32
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:11,624
Hey, beat it!

33
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,596
<i>This is me. </i>

34
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:05,229
<i>You're not going to let me
walk up here by myself. </i>

35
00:10:07,474 --> 00:10:10,204
<i>Look, why don't you come up
to my place for a little coffee? </i>

36
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:15,039
<i>George, what you need
is a good woman to look after you. </i>

37
00:10:17,418 --> 00:10:19,045
<i>George! </i>

38
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:20,069
Where have you been?

39
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:24,414
Go back to sleep.

40
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:54,004
Watch where you're going!

41
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,816
A little mouse!

42
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:04,956
Don't be touching it, darling.

43
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:08,260
No, no, no. Give me your hand.
Don't, please.

44
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:12,121
You can't touch it. It's vermin.
- It's just a little mouse.

45
00:12:12,433 --> 00:12:16,301
<i>Well, these conditions
speak for themselves. </i>

46
00:12:16,437 --> 00:12:18,302
<i>You can't possibly deny</i>

47
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:23,399
<i>that there is a very considerable
health risk under which</i>

48
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:26,308
<i>many of the good people
of Glasgow are at present living. </i>

49
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:30,679
<i>There's a risk in the form
of decomposition of this material, </i>

50
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:32,752
<i>a risk of fire, </i>

51
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:35,583
<i>a risk of it being spread by rats, </i>

52
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:38,117
<i>which are notorious vectors
of disease. </i>

53
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:42,825
Remember Pete Connelly? He waited
months before he heard anything.

54
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,727
You've told me already.

55
00:12:44,832 --> 00:12:47,630
Well, they ended up
with a great house, didn't they?

56
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:52,930
They were going to throw
this stuff out at work.

57
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,968
What's that for?

58
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:57,168
It's brand-new.
Hasn't even been opened.

59
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,177
What color is it?

60
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,342
It's a kind of pastel shade.

61
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,583
You've got to be joking.

62
00:13:07,688 --> 00:13:09,553
It's gray!

63
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,681
- It's pale blue.
- Your ass it is.

64
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:14,954
Look at it in the light.

65
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:17,660
It's pale blue.

66
00:13:18,432 --> 00:13:21,367
Definitely.
- You're not putting that up in here.

67
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:24,130
- Why not? It's good-quality paint.
- It's bloody horrible!

68
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:26,636
Look, give this place
a couple of coats,

69
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,867
cheer it up a little bit,
it's going to look beautiful.

70
00:13:28,976 --> 00:13:32,207
What's the point?
We're moving.

71
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,438
Yeah, maybe.

72
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:48,417
There's tea in the pot
if you want some.

73
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:55,832
All right, I'm off.

74
00:13:56,103 --> 00:13:58,003
It's good-quality paint.

75
00:14:00,374 --> 00:14:03,969
James, don't you go near that canal.
Do you hear me?

76
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:02,832
What are you staring at,
you little pervert?

77
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:06,133
- That's my ma's.
- So? What's it got to do with you?

78
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:13,643
Do you want a photo?
- Of you?

79
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,879
Stop making a mess of that table.

80
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,048
Shut up.

81
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:39,371
Hey, gorgeous!

82
00:15:39,473 --> 00:15:41,407
Where are you going?

83
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:36,428
Don't you have a pal or something?

84
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:42,659
Where are you going?

85
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,168
Nowhere.

86
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:47,934
Make yourself useful.
Get me a can of beer from the fridge.

87
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:52,005
What?
Go on, do what I tell you.

88
00:16:53,747 --> 00:16:55,442
Move.

89
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:15,191
<i>Yes! You beauty!
Go on, son! </i>

90
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:24,867
<i>Beautiful, Celtic, beautiful! </i>

91
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,742
I'm telling my dad on you.

92
00:17:33,787 --> 00:17:37,416
My head!
- Big girls don't cry.

93
00:17:38,592 --> 00:17:40,560
Go away.

94
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:45,659
- You gonna tell my da?
- Yes, I'm telling.

95
00:17:45,766 --> 00:17:48,326
And I'll tell him
you drank his beer as well.

96
00:17:49,703 --> 00:17:51,796
Anne Marie, shut up!

97
00:17:57,144 --> 00:18:00,045
Okay, I won't tell.

98
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:04,208
- So you're not gonna tell my da?
- No, I won't tell.

99
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:06,217
<i>Where's my beer? </i>

100
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:09,518
Dad?

101
00:18:14,795 --> 00:18:16,319
Where were you?

102
00:18:17,531 --> 00:18:19,362
You gonna watch football?
It's an old firm game.

103
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:23,697
- I don't like football.
- I like football, Dad. Can I watch it?

104
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:25,862
You come over here
and watch it with me.

105
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,935
I've got it. Over here!

106
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:37,943
Where's the little mouse?

107
00:18:38,051 --> 00:18:40,884
Remember that little mouse
you put down the toilet?

108
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:44,750
The little mouse.

109
00:18:44,891 --> 00:18:47,291
It's gone out to sea, darling.

110
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:49,991
The seaside?

111
00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:52,695
Yes. It went for a swim.

112
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,760
Da, James hurt me.

113
00:18:57,504 --> 00:18:59,836
He drank your beer as well.

114
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,773
Did he now?
I'll see to that later.

115
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:07,074
Now let me watch.

116
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,114
Go on, son. Jump for it!
- You killed my mouse, Dad.

117
00:19:11,218 --> 00:19:13,880
Yes, yes!

118
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,315
Goal! Attack!

119
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,245
Give them back, you bastard.

120
00:19:42,782 --> 00:19:44,807
- Say pretty please.
- Pretty please.

121
00:19:44,918 --> 00:19:48,115
- Pretty please with a cherry on top.
- Pretty please with a cherry on top.

122
00:19:48,221 --> 00:19:49,813
What will you give me
if I give you them?

123
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:52,754
- Anything.
- No. Fuck off.

124
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:56,522
- The stupid cow can't see a thing.
- Have you lost your panties as well?

125
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,598
Just give me them back.

126
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,562
See you later, darling.

127
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,441
You bastard!

128
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:17,112
Fucking cow.

129
00:20:17,751 --> 00:20:19,946
- Asshole!
- Fuckin' bitch!

130
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:31,560
Can you see my glasses in there?

131
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:34,700
Can you?

132
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:40,629
- No.
- Are you sure?

133
00:20:43,043 --> 00:20:45,807
- Yes.
- Come and sit over here.

134
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:48,512
- What?
- Sit here.

135
00:20:57,624 --> 00:20:59,854
- What's your name?
- James.

136
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:04,396
- You want a drag?
- No.

137
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,098
I'll kill that bastard Matt Monroe.

138
00:21:15,008 --> 00:21:17,374
That canal gives me the creeps.

139
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:24,173
Did you know that boy
who drowned down here?

140
00:21:25,585 --> 00:21:27,382
Ryan Quinn?

141
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:42,692
You wanna touch it?

142
00:22:14,601 --> 00:22:17,035
See you later, James.

143
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:41,619
- It's heavy.
- Help me get it on.

144
00:22:41,728 --> 00:22:43,923
Don't tilt it too much.

145
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:51,329
Have you got it?
- Yes. Hurry up.

146
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:55,101
Hold on a minute.

147
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:58,006
Okay, push it in. Lift it up.

148
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:02,145
What did you let go for?
- It's your fault.

149
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:05,547
- What are you talking about?
- It's all your fault!

150
00:23:05,652 --> 00:23:07,620
You want to calm down?
What's the matter with you?

151
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,312
You killed my boy.

152
00:23:09,422 --> 00:23:12,949
What are you fucking talking about?
That was my boy as well.

153
00:23:13,193 --> 00:23:15,354
I loved him just as much as you,
and you know it.

154
00:23:15,462 --> 00:23:17,760
You killed him.
You weren't there!

155
00:23:17,864 --> 00:23:20,560
Come on, get a grip on yourself.
Please.

156
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:23,830
Get away from me, you bastard.
I hate you!

157
00:23:23,937 --> 00:23:26,098
Get away!

158
00:23:26,206 --> 00:23:29,505
I can't deal with you anymore.
Every time I come near you, we argue.

159
00:23:45,892 --> 00:23:47,792
He left us.

160
00:23:48,027 --> 00:23:51,690
He left my boy.
I couldn't watch him myself.

161
00:23:52,232 --> 00:23:54,792
I hate him.

162
00:23:55,702 --> 00:23:57,897
He killed my boy.

163
00:24:02,142 --> 00:24:04,110
Where is James going?

164
00:24:06,479 --> 00:24:09,039
James, get my packages.

165
00:24:09,249 --> 00:24:12,082
Leaving them lying
in the middle of the street. Hurry up.

166
00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:31,933
- James, come here, son.
- Where are you going?

167
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:35,769
- I was gonna take the packages up.
- Just do what you're told.

168
00:24:37,277 --> 00:24:40,007
Would you give me a little hug?

169
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:52,151
He's the double of my Ryan, isn't he?
The same eyes.

170
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:54,923
Yes.

171
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:57,391
Maybe a little.

172
00:24:59,432 --> 00:25:01,525
Will you do me a little favor?

173
00:25:02,135 --> 00:25:04,695
Will you go up
to Ryan's room for me

174
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:07,170
and get the little box
on Ryan's bed?

175
00:25:07,273 --> 00:25:09,571
Will you do that for me?

176
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:12,144
Go on, James. It's all right.

177
00:25:30,763 --> 00:25:32,560
Oh, fuck.

178
00:26:36,496 --> 00:26:38,361
They look great.

179
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:41,160
- They're hurting me.
- Shut up, you.

180
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:43,497
What do you say?

181
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:48,600
Say thanks to Mrs. Quinn.
- They're too small.

182
00:26:54,747 --> 00:26:56,544
Thanks.

183
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:44,886
James, look what I've got.

184
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:52,636
Ah, it's lovely.
What's its name?

185
00:27:52,739 --> 00:27:56,368
- Suzy. She's a she.
- It's nice.

186
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:59,239
I've got budgies and gerbils
in the house.

187
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:03,213
On my birthday I'm getting
rats, tigers, bears,

188
00:28:03,883 --> 00:28:05,680
and mouse-eating snakes.

189
00:28:05,785 --> 00:28:07,116
That's good.

190
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,087
When I'm older, I'm going to have
the biggest zoo in the world.

191
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:12,623
Look. I'm a member of the RSPCA.

192
00:28:12,725 --> 00:28:14,693
That's good, man.

193
00:28:24,237 --> 00:28:27,229
- What are you looking for?
- Nothing.

194
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:30,241
Wow, look at all
the little tadpoles in there.

195
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:35,237
- Have you ever seen a perch?
- A peach?

196
00:28:35,348 --> 00:28:37,248
A perch.

197
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,780
It's about that size,

198
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:42,411
with spiky, jagged fins.

199
00:28:43,189 --> 00:28:46,056
I saw a guy catch one the other day.
- Was it big?

200
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,127
About that size.

201
00:28:48,261 --> 00:28:51,890
- You want to catch one?
- It's not that easy, Kenny.

202
00:28:52,465 --> 00:28:54,831
I've got a net in the house.

203
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:57,533
It would pull you under.

204
00:28:58,171 --> 00:29:02,403
- I'm a great swimmer.
- Another time, Kenny. See you later.

205
00:29:04,577 --> 00:29:07,102
James, what am I?

206
00:29:07,847 --> 00:29:09,838
Are you a bird?

207
00:29:12,452 --> 00:29:15,751
No, I'm an ostrich.
An ostrich can't fly.

208
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:20,316
See you later, Kenny.

209
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:24,693
James, are you coming
to my zoo tomorrow?

210
00:29:24,797 --> 00:29:28,233
- Maybe. Bye.
- See you later.

211
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,361
Is your mommy home, sweetheart?

212
00:29:35,341 --> 00:29:39,573
She just went out
to see my auntie at the hospital.

213
00:29:40,413 --> 00:29:42,904
Because I thought I saw her
coming up the road there.

214
00:29:43,015 --> 00:29:46,178
She came up
and then she went back out.

215
00:29:46,285 --> 00:29:49,516
I see.
Will you give her this?

216
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:52,216
Your mom's never in, is she?

217
00:29:52,425 --> 00:29:55,053
Here, give her this from me.

218
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,655
Tell her the rent is due.

219
00:30:02,101 --> 00:30:04,126
Has he gone away?

220
00:30:25,358 --> 00:30:27,588
You could get 50 pence for this.

221
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,155
A nice one there.

222
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:35,323
The smell in this place!

223
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,733
What's that?

224
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:44,707
Somebody's tossed out
a perfectly good dog.

225
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:48,075
- The smell of it!
- It's full of maggots.

226
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,451
- Fancy a swim?
- Fuck off.

227
00:30:55,555 --> 00:30:59,082
- Fancy a Ryan Quinn?
- Fuck off. You first, mate.

228
00:31:04,397 --> 00:31:06,695
Are you a good swimmer?

229
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:09,862
In you go.

230
00:31:12,939 --> 00:31:15,271
- Piss off.
- What?

231
00:31:18,978 --> 00:31:20,878
<i>Hey, leave him alone. </i>

232
00:31:26,018 --> 00:31:28,145
<i>Don't do that to the little guy. </i>

233
00:31:30,523 --> 00:31:32,889
- You shit yourself.
- Just joking.

234
00:31:38,197 --> 00:31:40,290
Hey, Stephen!

235
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:46,932
All right! Big man. How are you doing?
We're off to Margaret Anne's.

236
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:51,101
Keep a look out the window
in case her ma comes.

237
00:32:05,458 --> 00:32:08,723
<i>- All right, Margaret Anne, guess who.
- Billy? </i>

238
00:32:13,733 --> 00:32:15,826
<i>Try harder.
Who is it, Margaret Anne? </i>

239
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:18,267
<i>Stephen. </i>

240
00:32:19,205 --> 00:32:22,470
<i>Okay, I don't know, but you better
get my glasses back, you prick. </i>

241
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:33,114
<i>Who is it, Margaret Anne? </i>

242
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,783
<i>It's you, Tommy.
Just fuck off. </i>

243
00:32:36,656 --> 00:32:40,649
<i>- Not bad, girl. One out of four.
- Leave me alone. </i>

244
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:48,598
<i>Your breath stinks. Piss off. </i>

245
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:53,499
<i>Piss off. </i>

246
00:32:56,776 --> 00:32:58,573
Don't you want a shot, man?

247
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:13,254
- Go on.
- Come on, on you go.

248
00:33:13,726 --> 00:33:16,024
Hurry up. Go for it.

249
00:33:17,897 --> 00:33:19,922
Go for it.

250
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:22,964
Go on.

251
00:33:25,438 --> 00:33:27,770
Scared of the bird?

252
00:33:30,176 --> 00:33:32,508
Whip it out.

253
00:33:33,112 --> 00:33:36,104
- We've been there, done that.
- Got the T-shirt.

254
00:33:37,016 --> 00:33:39,041
Hey, man, you okay?

255
00:33:39,985 --> 00:33:42,453
What's it like down there?

256
00:33:42,755 --> 00:33:45,087
He boldly went
where no man's gone before.

257
00:33:45,725 --> 00:33:48,387
Call an ambulance for that guy.

258
00:33:52,665 --> 00:33:54,428
Feather duster.

259
00:33:55,668 --> 00:33:57,636
Push the cobwebs away.

260
00:34:42,615 --> 00:34:46,483
- What was that?
- He stuck his two fingers up at us.

261
00:34:52,858 --> 00:34:55,292
Hi, Lisa. Hi, Leanne.

262
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:58,794
Margaret, is it all right if I leave her
here? My ma will be back soon.

263
00:35:18,651 --> 00:35:21,085
Lisa, don't play in the rubbish.

264
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:35,532
Where are you going?

265
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:38,102
Piss off.
I'm telling my ma on you.

266
00:35:39,672 --> 00:35:41,765
I can do what I like.
It's a free country.

267
00:35:41,907 --> 00:35:45,206
There's no way you're getting
on this bus with me. Go home. Beat it.

268
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:48,178
- Have you got a boyfriend?
- It's none of your business.

269
00:35:49,381 --> 00:35:51,645
Look at the state of your knees.
They're pure black.

270
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,650
No, they're not.

271
00:35:58,858 --> 00:36:01,224
Look, go home. You're not getting
on this bus with me.

272
00:36:01,327 --> 00:36:04,160
- Just tell me where you're going.
- No, I'm not telling you nothing.

273
00:36:31,757 --> 00:36:34,248
- Can I have a ten pence, please?
- Where are you going?

274
00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:39,153
- Can I have a ten pence, please?
- Where are you going, son?

275
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:43,128
Here.

276
00:36:44,136 --> 00:36:46,661
Just go on. Go on.

277
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:12,018
Okay, son, that's as far as I go.

278
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:15,354
This is the end of my line.
Are you getting off or what?

279
00:42:55,874 --> 00:42:59,310
- You know I love you, don't you?
- Oh, go away.

280
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:04,579
Come here, gorgeous.

281
00:43:04,716 --> 00:43:07,776
I'm always gorgeous
when you're half drunk.

282
00:43:08,687 --> 00:43:13,715
Your ma...
is one in a million.

283
00:43:13,825 --> 00:43:16,350
Da, shut up.
I'm trying to watch this.

284
00:43:16,461 --> 00:43:20,022
Your ma is one in a million.

285
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,328
Look at him.

286
00:44:07,779 --> 00:44:10,213
Anne, have you seen my cigarettes?

287
00:44:15,687 --> 00:44:17,848
Ow, it's stinging!

288
00:44:19,591 --> 00:44:22,287
It's nowhere near your eyes.

289
00:44:25,897 --> 00:44:27,660
Get up.

290
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:29,796
They're not here.

291
00:44:37,709 --> 00:44:40,769
<i>- Scottish League Division Two,
- I was watching that.</i>

292
00:44:40,879 --> 00:44:44,474
<i>Stirling Albion 20, Selkirk 0.</i>

293
00:44:49,221 --> 00:44:50,813
You jerk.

294
00:44:50,922 --> 00:44:52,617
What?

295
00:44:53,859 --> 00:44:55,986
Come here, you.
You've been scratching and all.

296
00:44:56,094 --> 00:44:57,925
No, I haven't.

297
00:45:01,433 --> 00:45:04,334
- Your head's crawling.
- No, it's not.

298
00:45:06,571 --> 00:45:08,505
James, sit.

299
00:45:10,342 --> 00:45:13,436
Where are my cigarettes?
Has anyone seen my cigarettes?

300
00:45:13,678 --> 00:45:16,374
If you'd open your eyes,
you might find them.

301
00:45:16,515 --> 00:45:18,210
They're over there.

302
00:45:18,316 --> 00:45:20,079
I looked there.

303
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:33,755
There's your wages, sweetheart.

304
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:37,858
You want me to leave
a couple of cigarettes for you?

305
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:40,333
No, that's all right.
I've got some.

306
00:45:40,572 --> 00:45:42,802
Okay, see you later.

307
00:45:45,877 --> 00:45:47,811
James, take this trash down.

308
00:45:47,913 --> 00:45:50,313
You take it down!

309
00:45:52,951 --> 00:45:56,182
I got them from you,
you little cow.

310
00:45:56,288 --> 00:45:59,485
Shut up!
Ma, he was scratching before me.

311
00:45:59,591 --> 00:46:02,355
Take her out now
and get her ready, will you?

312
00:46:07,966 --> 00:46:10,161
Ma, have you heard anything
about the new house yet?

313
00:46:10,469 --> 00:46:12,869
No, sweetie, we're still waiting.

314
00:46:21,746 --> 00:46:23,771
Keep your head down.

315
00:46:26,318 --> 00:46:28,786
- Can I see it?
- Stay still.

316
00:46:28,887 --> 00:46:31,515
What do they look like?

317
00:46:37,062 --> 00:46:39,860
I can't see anything.
- Look.

318
00:46:40,732 --> 00:46:42,131
Is that it?

319
00:47:19,971 --> 00:47:22,667
James, you're gonna catch
lung cancer.

320
00:47:24,576 --> 00:47:28,410
- Is that right, Kenny?
- I'm not allowed to play down there.

321
00:47:29,848 --> 00:47:33,909
It's an envir... an enviro...
A really mental health hazard.

322
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:35,714
What?

323
00:47:47,432 --> 00:47:49,195
Guess what.

324
00:47:49,768 --> 00:47:52,794
- What?
- It's my birthday today.

325
00:47:52,904 --> 00:47:54,667
Happy birthday.

326
00:47:54,906 --> 00:47:57,136
Want to see my present?

327
00:47:58,009 --> 00:47:59,704
Two minutes.

328
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:03,907
Are you still here?
- Yeah.

329
00:48:22,734 --> 00:48:25,134
Are you all right in there, Snowball?

330
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:27,534
Happy birthday, Kenny.

331
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:36,270
<i>- Who's your pal, James?
- Look, it's animal boy. </i>

332
00:48:38,383 --> 00:48:40,283
- What's that you've got?
- Stop it.

333
00:48:40,385 --> 00:48:41,977
- I'm not doing anything.
- Stop it.

334
00:48:42,087 --> 00:48:44,612
- Look, it's a rat.
- It's not a rat.

335
00:48:45,924 --> 00:48:48,654
- What's its name, Kenny?
- Snowball.

336
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,593
- Ah, that's lovely.
- Let's see it out.

337
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:53,288
No.

338
00:48:53,398 --> 00:48:55,525
OnlyJames can see it.

339
00:49:05,243 --> 00:49:06,801
Let me see it.

340
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,972
It's lovely.

341
00:49:14,419 --> 00:49:16,387
- Let me see it.
- No.

342
00:49:16,855 --> 00:49:19,187
Come on, you're one of the boys.

343
00:49:19,324 --> 00:49:21,019
Am l, James?

1
00:49:24,224 --> 00:49:26,556
Okay, then, but only for a minute.

2
00:49:31,598 --> 00:49:33,896
The little bastard bit me.

3
00:49:34,234 --> 00:49:35,929
Give me my mouse back.

4
00:49:36,036 --> 00:49:38,129
The fucking thing cut my finger.

5
00:49:43,210 --> 00:49:45,804
Give it back!

6
00:49:45,913 --> 00:49:48,313
Give me my fucking mouse back!

7
00:49:48,415 --> 00:49:50,906
Move. I want it back!

8
00:49:53,687 --> 00:49:56,155
You're going to kill it.

9
00:49:56,423 --> 00:49:58,687
Throw it on the ground.

10
00:50:05,265 --> 00:50:07,233
It can fly, Kenny.

11
00:50:07,401 --> 00:50:09,961
Let it fly toJames.

12
00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:11,970
Go on.

13
00:50:13,106 --> 00:50:16,769
- All right, James! My mouse can fly.
- Where's it gonna fly to?

14
00:50:16,877 --> 00:50:20,142
- Go on, James. Fucking kill it.
- Where will it fly to, James?

15
00:50:21,148 --> 00:50:23,082
Just fling it at the wall.

16
00:50:23,383 --> 00:50:25,613
- The moon.
- That's sad.

17
00:50:28,555 --> 00:50:30,386
My mouse is going to the moon?

18
00:50:30,958 --> 00:50:35,190
You better put it back in its cage.
It's done enough flying today.

19
00:50:41,268 --> 00:50:43,133
My ma's gonna slap you for this.

20
00:50:43,237 --> 00:50:45,102
Your mother only wears panties
to keep her ankles warm.

21
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:53,146
<i>- Is that a friend of yours, James?
- You going to the moon with him? </i>

22
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:55,405
<i>- Look, James.
- He's a fuckin'psycho. </i>

23
00:50:55,516 --> 00:50:57,108
<i>"I'm going to the moon. "</i>

24
00:50:58,385 --> 00:51:00,512
Look, everybody.

25
00:51:07,728 --> 00:51:09,662
Bye-bye, Snowball.

26
00:54:09,176 --> 00:54:10,438
Hi, James.

27
00:54:10,544 --> 00:54:12,205
Hi, Kenny.

28
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:15,541
What are you doing?
- What?

29
00:54:15,816 --> 00:54:18,444
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna catch a perch.

30
00:54:19,386 --> 00:54:21,650
- How are you gonna do that?
- I'll show you.

31
00:54:21,755 --> 00:54:24,724
You see this bread?
I'm going to throw it in like that.

32
00:54:25,425 --> 00:54:28,553
When they come up,
I'm going to do this and catch it.

33
00:54:28,662 --> 00:54:31,688
I'll catch one, James.
Watch this.

34
00:54:37,237 --> 00:54:40,900
I've got it, I've got it!
- Do some more.

35
00:54:41,007 --> 00:54:43,168
See that, man?

36
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:49,574
- What was that, Kenny?
- They're bitin'.

37
00:54:51,551 --> 00:54:54,952
- Aren't there any down there?
- Don't know. Must be.

38
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:03,259
- You want a hand?
- No, James. I want to do it all myself.

39
00:55:04,998 --> 00:55:09,332
Okay. I'm gonna go, Kenny.
See you later.

40
00:55:09,436 --> 00:55:11,870
Is he stupid or something?

41
00:55:12,239 --> 00:55:13,831
He's all right.

42
00:55:14,174 --> 00:55:15,801
I've got one.

43
00:55:16,610 --> 00:55:18,601
Oh, it got away.

44
00:55:47,641 --> 00:55:50,041
Ow, you're hurting me.

45
00:55:51,278 --> 00:55:53,143
You wanna see 'em?

46
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:01,685
I can't see anything.

47
00:56:01,788 --> 00:56:04,552
There's the little beast. See?

48
00:56:05,592 --> 00:56:08,060
You need your glasses back.

49
00:56:12,732 --> 00:56:14,290
Hang on.
I'll find another one.

50
00:56:14,401 --> 00:56:16,232
A bigger one.

51
00:56:25,579 --> 00:56:27,547
I've got it.

52
00:56:29,683 --> 00:56:31,514
See it?

53
00:56:31,751 --> 00:56:33,844
Yes, I think so.

54
00:56:35,722 --> 00:56:37,883
The big beast.

55
00:56:46,032 --> 00:56:47,226
You're done.

56
00:56:47,334 --> 00:56:49,598
Did you kill them all?

57
00:56:49,936 --> 00:56:52,029
I think so.
You need to go wash it now.

58
00:57:06,686 --> 00:57:08,210
<i>George! </i>

59
00:57:15,729 --> 00:57:19,256
George, you have to help me.
It's my boy... he's in the canal!

60
00:57:56,269 --> 00:57:58,499
You've got to wet your hair first.

61
00:58:20,427 --> 00:58:24,329
Fifty-seven! I can get up to 7 0
if I count faster.

62
00:59:36,036 --> 00:59:39,301
- Where's the soap?
- I don't know.

63
00:59:43,576 --> 00:59:45,737
I need to pee.

64
01:00:20,547 --> 01:00:23,983
<i>Although neither side
is willing to say so openly, </i>

65
01:00:24,084 --> 01:00:27,713
<i>it's clear the threat to bring in troops
made the strike leaders back down. </i>

66
01:00:27,821 --> 01:00:30,654
<i>Clearing up all this mess will mean
thousands of pounds</i>

67
01:00:30,757 --> 01:00:32,987
<i>in bonuses and overtime
for the refuse collectors, </i>

68
01:00:33,126 --> 01:00:36,027
<i>compensating them for the nine weeks
they've been on strike. </i>

69
01:00:36,129 --> 01:00:38,222
<i>The threat of someone else
doing the work</i>

70
01:00:38,331 --> 01:00:40,128
<i>and the fact they'd lose
all the extra money</i>

71
01:00:40,233 --> 01:00:42,394
<i>produced an abrupt
change of heart. </i>

72
01:01:04,991 --> 01:01:07,459
Your da's a hero.

73
01:01:58,811 --> 01:02:02,212
<i>- Is your mother or father in?
- My da's in, but he's sleeping. </i>

74
01:02:02,315 --> 01:02:05,250
<i>- We're from the council. Can we come in?
- Is it about our new house? </i>

75
01:02:05,351 --> 01:02:07,478
<i>Come on in. </i>

76
01:02:13,193 --> 01:02:15,684
Da.

77
01:02:16,196 --> 01:02:19,359
It's the new house people. Wake up.
- Fuck off.

78
01:02:19,465 --> 01:02:22,229
- It's the new house people.
- What?

79
01:02:24,137 --> 01:02:26,105
Who the fuck are you?

80
01:02:26,272 --> 01:02:29,799
I'm Miss McDonald. This is Mr. Mohan.
We're from the council.

81
01:02:29,909 --> 01:02:32,571
We've come to inspect
the condition of your property

82
01:02:32,679 --> 01:02:34,670
and assess your standard of living.

83
01:02:34,781 --> 01:02:37,147
Have we caught you
at a bad time?

84
01:02:48,027 --> 01:02:51,827
We just want to look around.
- Mrs. Fowler's boy was in the canal.

85
01:02:51,931 --> 01:02:55,731
I had to go in the canal,
and I can't even swim.

86
01:02:56,302 --> 01:02:59,135
I had to go through the rubbish
out back. Have you seen out there?

87
01:02:59,239 --> 01:03:00,797
It's a fucking disgrace.

88
01:03:00,907 --> 01:03:04,035
I see it's a three-bedroom property
you're looking for, Mr. Gillespie.

89
01:03:04,143 --> 01:03:05,633
That's right.

90
01:03:05,745 --> 01:03:09,841
Are we getting a big house
with a bath, a toilet and a field?

91
01:03:10,783 --> 01:03:12,910
Are we, Da?

92
01:03:19,525 --> 01:03:22,255
You'd better come back
when the wife's here.

93
01:03:22,362 --> 01:03:25,695
We've got all the information we need.
Thanks very much, Mr. Gillespie.

94
01:03:28,101 --> 01:03:30,365
Bye-bye now.
Sorry about the mess.

95
01:03:36,376 --> 01:03:37,968
Come here, you.

96
01:03:41,447 --> 01:03:44,177
Can't you fucking do anything right?

97
01:03:44,284 --> 01:03:46,775
What did you let them in for?

98
01:03:46,886 --> 01:03:49,081
- 'Cause I thought that...
- 'Cause you thought.

99
01:03:57,030 --> 01:03:59,055
Are we still getting the new house?

100
01:03:59,165 --> 01:04:02,498
If we don't, it's your fucking fault.
Now get out of my sight.

101
01:04:27,894 --> 01:04:30,920
Would you hold still a minute?
What's the matter with you?

102
01:04:31,230 --> 01:04:33,494
I'm itchy.
Are you about finished?

103
01:04:33,633 --> 01:04:36,431
I think you caught something
in that canal.

104
01:04:41,441 --> 01:04:43,500
All right, you're all done.

105
01:04:58,358 --> 01:05:01,759
Margaret says the council inspectors
were up to see her house today.

106
01:05:01,961 --> 01:05:04,327
They didn't come here, did they?
- Who?

107
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:06,364
This place was a mess.

108
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:10,833
Dad, here. Mr. Mullen never took
the money for it.

109
01:05:10,937 --> 01:05:12,928
He didn't?

110
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:15,735
- Tell you what: You keep it, sweetie.
- Really? Thanks, Da.

111
01:05:15,842 --> 01:05:18,811
He told me to tell you you're a hero.
- Did he?

112
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,339
Look at the face on you.

113
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:29,888
Here's your shoes, Daddy.

114
01:05:37,697 --> 01:05:39,858
That's brilliant.

115
01:05:42,969 --> 01:05:45,233
Can I have 50 pence?

116
01:05:50,843 --> 01:05:53,004
That's Mom's!

117
01:06:01,988 --> 01:06:04,252
Where does that boy go?

118
01:06:06,726 --> 01:06:08,523
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls, </i>

119
01:06:08,628 --> 01:06:12,257
<i>it's a great pleasure for me
as Lord Provost</i>

120
01:06:12,365 --> 01:06:13,992
<i>to welcome you here...</i>

121
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:16,068
Check out that guy's sideburns.

122
01:06:19,071 --> 01:06:21,232
James, do you think Snowball's
on the moon yet?

123
01:06:22,375 --> 01:06:23,740
You be quiet.

124
01:06:23,843 --> 01:06:27,210
I don't want to hear another word
about that mouse. Now shut up.

125
01:06:29,949 --> 01:06:33,385
- Even the McKays are moving soon.
- Yes, I heard, sweetie.

126
01:06:33,486 --> 01:06:35,920
- When are we going to be moving?
- We'll hear soon.

127
01:06:36,022 --> 01:06:37,683
You always say that.

128
01:06:37,790 --> 01:06:40,588
I will now hand out
the certificates and the medals

129
01:06:40,726 --> 01:06:43,286
as awards for your acts of bravery.

130
01:06:43,396 --> 01:06:45,387
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

131
01:06:49,402 --> 01:06:52,894
As I call your name,
will you please come forward?

132
01:06:55,475 --> 01:06:58,137
Thanks, George. Don't know what
I would have done.

133
01:06:58,244 --> 01:07:00,337
I can't thank you enough.

134
01:07:00,446 --> 01:07:02,573
What have you got to say
to Mr. Gillespie, Kenny?

135
01:07:02,715 --> 01:07:05,240
We sent Snowball to the moon.
Didn't we, James?

136
01:07:05,351 --> 01:07:07,683
What did I tell you to say?
Look at the man when you're speaking!

137
01:07:07,787 --> 01:07:11,279
Thanks for saving my wife...
I mean life.

138
01:07:19,932 --> 01:07:22,594
- My da's a hero.
- That's right, sweetheart.

139
01:07:26,405 --> 01:07:28,373
Look, there he is up there.
See him?

140
01:07:29,408 --> 01:07:31,638
- Alan McCallen.
- George Gillespie.

141
01:07:54,333 --> 01:07:56,699
Da, it's lovely.

142
01:07:57,603 --> 01:07:59,696
Can I keep it?

143
01:08:00,206 --> 01:08:02,640
I'm going for a quick drink,
meeting the boys at the pub.

144
01:08:02,742 --> 01:08:05,074
Don't be too long.

145
01:08:05,878 --> 01:08:07,778
See you later, sweetie.

146
01:08:31,938 --> 01:08:34,338
Ma, remember:
Put Tom Jones on.

147
01:08:36,442 --> 01:08:40,003
Ma, I asked you to put Tom Jones on.
You weren't listening.

148
01:08:42,682 --> 01:08:45,515
I told you to put Tom Jones on.

149
01:08:49,121 --> 01:08:52,386
You guys wouldn't know a good tune
if it came up and bit you.

150
01:08:52,491 --> 01:08:55,824
- Put Tom Jones on!
- Stop screaming in my ear.

151
01:08:57,263 --> 01:08:58,890
Tom Jones is shit, Anne Marie.

152
01:08:58,998 --> 01:09:01,091
You're a big shit.

153
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:04,533
Hey, you two, that's enough
of that language in my house.

154
01:09:04,637 --> 01:09:06,662
- He said it first.
- You hear me, young lady?

155
01:09:08,307 --> 01:09:11,708
- Da swears all the time.
- Okay, who's dancing?

156
01:09:12,612 --> 01:09:15,911
Come on, who's gonna dance?
I'll dance by myself.

157
01:09:18,751 --> 01:09:21,549
Me and your da were the best jivers
at the Lindella.

158
01:09:30,196 --> 01:09:31,686
She's mad.

159
01:09:31,831 --> 01:09:35,699
Is that right? Bet you couldn't do it.
Are you dancing?

160
01:09:36,769 --> 01:09:39,670
You're supposed to say,
"Are you asking?" Are you dancing?

161
01:09:39,772 --> 01:09:42,536
- No way.
- Come on, James. One dance for your Ma.

162
01:09:49,181 --> 01:09:51,547
James can't jive.

163
01:09:55,254 --> 01:09:57,222
James can't jive.

164
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:03,326
Watch this move.

165
01:10:05,398 --> 01:10:07,366
James can jive.

166
01:10:13,205 --> 01:10:15,298
Let's try a double.

167
01:10:21,814 --> 01:10:25,011
- James can't jive.
- Yes, he can. James is a good jiver.

168
01:10:25,117 --> 01:10:27,415
I'll dance with you, Ma.

169
01:10:35,661 --> 01:10:40,428
One drink, one little drink. That's all.
Then you can go home.

170
01:10:40,533 --> 01:10:42,967
You're a lovely woman,
but I need to go.

171
01:10:43,069 --> 01:10:44,934
I don't have any money.
Come on.

172
01:10:48,541 --> 01:10:52,375
I've got to go.
Buy yourself a drink, okay?

173
01:10:52,511 --> 01:10:54,138
You're a lovely woman.

174
01:10:54,246 --> 01:10:57,215
See you later, darling.
Look after yourself.

175
01:10:57,583 --> 01:10:59,551
You too. Bye.

176
01:11:09,495 --> 01:11:12,794
Mister, can you hold my cat for me
so I can go to the ice cream van?

177
01:11:12,898 --> 01:11:15,992
Sure I can.
Be careful crossing the street.

178
01:11:20,106 --> 01:11:21,835
- Yes, dear?
- Can I get one of these?

179
01:11:40,726 --> 01:11:43,126
Where'd you get the cat, you pussy?

180
01:11:44,029 --> 01:11:46,395
Fuck off, all of you.

181
01:11:47,466 --> 01:11:49,661
Who do you think you're talking to?

182
01:12:51,697 --> 01:12:53,358
Try them on.

183
01:13:03,442 --> 01:13:05,069
I don't want to.

184
01:13:05,177 --> 01:13:08,237
I bought them for you, you ungrateful
little bastard. Now get 'em on.

185
01:13:13,319 --> 01:13:15,378
Look at 'em. They're too big.

186
01:13:21,026 --> 01:13:22,550
Let me see.

187
01:13:25,231 --> 01:13:27,563
I don't fuckin' like football!

188
01:14:42,875 --> 01:14:45,810
<i>I thought I heard a noise.
What are you doing up here, son? </i>

189
01:14:48,380 --> 01:14:50,678
Who are you looking for?

190
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:57,054
Don't you have a tongue
in your head?

191
01:15:00,893 --> 01:15:03,521
Oh, my God, they're getting
younger and younger.

192
01:15:03,629 --> 01:15:05,494
Another one.

193
01:15:08,167 --> 01:15:10,032
Shit. There's your ma.

194
01:15:10,135 --> 01:15:13,298
Don't worry, she won't come in.
Just turn the light out.

195
01:15:19,745 --> 01:15:21,576
I'm freezing.

196
01:15:23,649 --> 01:15:25,810
Aren't you coming in?

197
01:15:56,982 --> 01:15:59,917
James, do you love me?

198
01:16:02,554 --> 01:16:04,454
Yes.

199
01:18:03,876 --> 01:18:05,844
Come on, let's go.

200
01:18:08,747 --> 01:18:10,977
Don't forget that mask.

201
01:18:11,550 --> 01:18:13,245
Get those masks on!

202
01:19:02,167 --> 01:19:04,397
Scabs! You're nothing
but a bunch of scabs.

203
01:19:04,503 --> 01:19:07,336
<i>Every last one of you.
- Shut your face. </i>

204
01:19:07,439 --> 01:19:09,930
<i>It's about time
these bags were cleared. </i>

205
01:19:10,042 --> 01:19:12,806
<i>You mind your own business,
you old cow! </i>

206
01:19:19,651 --> 01:19:21,448
Hey, come on.

207
01:19:22,387 --> 01:19:23,979
Beat it!

208
01:19:59,591 --> 01:20:01,218
James!

209
01:20:02,761 --> 01:20:04,422
Look!

210
01:20:27,986 --> 01:20:30,921
- Can I get up?
- No, we're too busy.

211
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:04,894
James, look. I killed it.

212
01:24:05,303 --> 01:24:07,271
I thought you were
a member of the RSPCA.

213
01:24:07,372 --> 01:24:10,034
My ma says they're verm... verm...
They're pests.

214
01:24:11,276 --> 01:24:14,302
You're ma's looking for you.
- Is she?

215
01:24:14,412 --> 01:24:15,606
Yes.

216
01:24:15,714 --> 01:24:17,181
Look at the moon.

217
01:24:18,350 --> 01:24:19,942
Hello, Snowball.

218
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:23,715
Snowball's dead, Kenny.

219
01:24:23,822 --> 01:24:25,255
You killed him.

220
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:36,891
Calm down, for fuck's sake.

221
01:24:44,009 --> 01:24:45,601
Go for it.

222
01:24:58,857 --> 01:25:02,224
Poor cow, poor cow,
poor cow, poor cow.

223
01:25:03,762 --> 01:25:05,957
Come on, it's my turn.

224
01:25:06,565 --> 01:25:08,658
Remember, be nice to him.

225
01:25:12,604 --> 01:25:15,630
I'm not your pal anymore.

226
01:25:16,975 --> 01:25:19,034
Fuck off, fuck off.

227
01:25:20,779 --> 01:25:24,271
- Fucking spastic!
- I saw you, I saw you, I saw you.

228
01:25:28,186 --> 01:25:30,518
You killed Ryan Quinn.
You killed him.

229
01:25:51,076 --> 01:25:53,044
Where have you been?
