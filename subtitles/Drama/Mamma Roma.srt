1
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,130
carmine and bride!

2
00:02:18,292 --> 00:02:20,869
Here come our brothers!

3
00:02:21,035 --> 00:02:23,297
Sure, sons of italy.

4
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:27,505
Italy, hell.
They're pretending they don't know me.

5
00:02:27,669 --> 00:02:31,171
Clementina, meet your in-laws!

6
00:02:31,339 --> 00:02:34,014
This is peppe, and this is nicola.

7
00:02:34,177 --> 00:02:37,266
This is regina, the pervert.
If you only knew what she does!

8
00:02:37,432 --> 00:02:41,065
Tell us! Don't be ashamed.
We're all open-minded here.

9
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:43,195
- She's a lady of the night!
- What's that?

10
00:02:43,365 --> 00:02:46,671
- A whore!
- Lucky her!

11
00:02:47,511 --> 00:02:49,545
Isn't she cute?

12
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:51,975
I'm not embarrassing you, am i?

13
00:02:54,529 --> 00:02:58,608
Clementina, did you get it?
She's a -

14
00:02:58,773 --> 00:03:02,470
- long live the newlyweds!
- Good luck!

15
00:03:08,693 --> 00:03:11,053
A speech from
the father of the bride!

16
00:03:13,382 --> 00:03:16,787
Ladies and gentlemen,
at this ceremony, as we are -

17
00:03:16,955 --> 00:03:20,871
- out on parole.
- I'm glad we're all here.

18
00:03:21,038 --> 00:03:26,041
We're people who work the land,
and yet we still have -

19
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,445
tuberculosis.

20
00:03:27,609 --> 00:03:29,229
Good hearts.

21
00:03:29,396 --> 00:03:34,910
They call us hicks,
but if we didn't work the land,

22
00:03:35,074 --> 00:03:36,977
what would the rich folks eat?

23
00:03:37,148 --> 00:03:40,585
Sit down.
I saw a guy die like that once.

24
00:03:42,954 --> 00:03:45,402
You gonna preach to us?

25
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:47,984
Mass should always be sung!

26
00:03:48,152 --> 00:03:50,959
Mamma roma, why don't you sing us
a song from the heart?

27
00:03:51,694 --> 00:03:52,802
You want me to sing?

28
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:00,622
O sweet acacia flower

29
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:07,037
when i sing, i sing with joy

30
00:04:07,772 --> 00:04:12,459
and if i told you the whole story

31
00:04:13,577 --> 00:04:16,602
it would ruin this celebration

32
00:04:19,415 --> 00:04:22,221
carmine, show 'em
you can still do it!

33
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:28,919
O flower of sage

34
00:04:29,847 --> 00:04:36,700
you laugh and joke
and act like a saint

35
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:44,896
but your heart is bursting with rage

36
00:04:47,264 --> 00:04:50,798
o mint flower

37
00:04:51,538 --> 00:04:55,802
hold your tongue
there's an innocent among us

38
00:04:56,802 --> 00:05:01,044
and it's better

39
00:05:01,204 --> 00:05:05,086
that she neither see nor hear

40
00:05:08,126 --> 00:05:11,498
- now it's the bride's turn!
- Sing, clementina!

41
00:05:12,177 --> 00:05:16,354
O squash flower

42
00:05:17,154 --> 00:05:22,798
once a woman was crazy
for that mustache

43
00:05:23,852 --> 00:05:29,747
and now that she's lost him
she can't get over it

44
00:05:38,686 --> 00:05:42,895
o flower of shit

45
00:05:47,395 --> 00:05:52,235
i've freed myself from the noose

46
00:05:52,403 --> 00:05:55,427
now it's another's turn

47
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,581
to be his servant

48
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:06,367
no hard feelings, new bride!
Congratulations!

49
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:09,373
I'm free! Free!

50
00:06:09,534 --> 00:06:12,492
Long live the bride and groom!

51
00:06:29,502 --> 00:06:33,037
You're laughing your head off.
Tell us what's so funny.

52
00:06:37,828 --> 00:06:40,819
So you're free
after five long years of slavery.

53
00:06:40,986 --> 00:06:44,075
So you've got money now
and you can do what you like.

54
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:47,361
So the man who exploited you
set you free,

55
00:06:47,525 --> 00:06:49,624
but calm down now,
or else you'll choke to death!

56
00:06:56,043 --> 00:06:58,240
Come on. What's so funny?

57
00:07:00,956 --> 00:07:04,741
Children!
They're really something!

58
00:07:04,911 --> 00:07:07,174
That's right.
That's the way to treat a woman.

59
00:07:11,036 --> 00:07:13,004
Do you love your mother?

60
00:07:13,173 --> 00:07:15,555
Yes.

61
00:07:17,097 --> 00:07:19,359
- You love your mother?
- Yes.

62
00:07:21,818 --> 00:07:25,190
I bless you in the name
of the father, son and holy ghost.

63
00:07:25,295 --> 00:07:26,948
One pimp dies,
and another is born.

64
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,831
My little pimp.

65
00:07:32,377 --> 00:07:34,410
Children are something!

66
00:07:34,578 --> 00:07:36,459
Carmine, good luck.

67
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,329
Clementina, come on, smile.

68
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,903
I hope you have
lots of children like jacob,

69
00:07:43,064 --> 00:07:47,686
so that you'll be
in god's grace all your lives.

70
00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:53,048
I wish you all the happiness
that should be in my house.

71
00:08:27,053 --> 00:08:28,097
Ettore.

72
00:09:03,738 --> 00:09:06,033
That son of a bitch.

73
00:09:08,938 --> 00:09:10,841
Who swiped my cigarettes?

74
00:09:11,521 --> 00:09:13,848
Let me smell your breath.

75
00:09:39,052 --> 00:09:40,128
Ettore!

76
00:09:45,941 --> 00:09:48,683
Don't you have a little kiss
for your mother?

77
00:09:54,586 --> 00:09:56,554
Damn it!

78
00:09:58,478 --> 00:10:01,371
Damn the countryside,
with all these pebbles!

79
00:10:02,179 --> 00:10:04,560
This corn is killing me.

80
00:10:12,227 --> 00:10:14,554
- Where are you going with your friends?
- Nowhere.

81
00:10:16,693 --> 00:10:17,770
See ya, ettore.

82
00:10:27,028 --> 00:10:29,888
How you've grown.
I hardly recognize you.

83
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:32,252
Did you think i'd stay the same?

84
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,258
Don't talk to me like that.

85
00:10:35,897 --> 00:10:37,005
What did i say?

86
00:10:38,545 --> 00:10:41,438
Good thing i'm taking you
back to rome with me,

87
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,860
or who knows
what you'd end up like here.

88
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:49,230
- Why are you taking me to rome?
- To keep the pope company!

89
00:10:51,144 --> 00:10:54,071
You want to spend your life
working the land?

90
00:10:55,101 --> 00:10:56,209
No.

91
00:10:57,302 --> 00:10:58,922
Have you at least
learned to read and write?

92
00:11:01,544 --> 00:11:03,100
I manage.

93
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:08,018
Tell me,

94
00:11:08,977 --> 00:11:12,001
is it true you've already been
with a woman?

95
00:11:12,869 --> 00:11:14,685
What am i going to do in rome?

96
00:11:19,152 --> 00:11:22,687
I didn't have a child
to have him turn into a hick!

97
00:11:22,854 --> 00:11:24,376
Use your brain.

98
00:11:25,214 --> 00:11:28,618
You don't know
what sacrifices i've had to make,

99
00:11:28,787 --> 00:11:33,050
the things i've had to do
to take you home with me,

100
00:11:33,221 --> 00:11:36,114
so that we could live
a decent life together.

101
00:11:36,283 --> 00:11:39,307
I've been waiting 16 years,

102
00:11:39,569 --> 00:11:41,450
and it hasn't been easy.

103
00:11:42,695 --> 00:11:45,468
You don't know yet
what an awful place the world can be.

104
00:11:56,317 --> 00:11:58,514
That's our house over there.

105
00:12:00,336 --> 00:12:04,513
The one with the window in the sun
and the panties hanging out.

106
00:12:04,674 --> 00:12:06,230
There, on the top floor.

107
00:12:06,396 --> 00:12:09,257
We'll only stay a few more days.

108
00:12:09,427 --> 00:12:11,276
Then i'll take you to a real home.

109
00:12:11,436 --> 00:12:13,917
You'll see how beautiful it is,

110
00:12:14,084 --> 00:12:18,382
full of respectable, high-class people.

111
00:12:49,493 --> 00:12:52,648
See them?
A fine bunch, aren't they?

112
00:12:52,811 --> 00:12:56,063
They're not like the kids
in the new place we're going,

113
00:12:56,224 --> 00:12:58,638
young people who study
and work hard.

114
00:12:58,809 --> 00:13:00,875
They're the ones
you want to make friends with.

115
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:29,937
Are you dense or something?
This is your home.

116
00:13:31,187 --> 00:13:33,068
Put the suitcase down.

117
00:13:39,417 --> 00:13:41,385
Did you think
i was some kind of witch?

118
00:13:41,554 --> 00:13:43,718
I've never caused trouble.

119
00:13:43,883 --> 00:13:46,395
Everyone's always liked me.

120
00:13:49,146 --> 00:13:50,484
Are you hungry?

121
00:13:50,646 --> 00:13:54,691
I had some bread this morning
with some spuds.

122
00:13:55,909 --> 00:13:57,626
What did you say?

123
00:13:58,047 --> 00:13:59,699
Watch how you talk.

124
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:04,354
You have to talk like your mother,
not like those hicks down there,

125
00:14:04,873 --> 00:14:06,047
or i'll cuff you one.

126
00:14:22,482 --> 00:14:27,616
O gypsy with your look
so sad and soulful

127
00:14:28,957 --> 00:14:32,296
you make your violin weep
in your hands

128
00:14:32,561 --> 00:14:33,964
can you dance?

129
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,289
A little. The cha-cha-cha.

130
00:14:36,454 --> 00:14:38,933
What? The cha-cha-cha?

131
00:14:39,165 --> 00:14:41,775
Come dance a tango
with your mother.

132
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,676
You're not shy, are you?

133
00:14:45,609 --> 00:14:49,274
Don't be shy. Follow me.
Watch out for my corn.

134
00:14:49,437 --> 00:14:51,122
Follow me.

135
00:14:55,658 --> 00:14:58,071
Now this way. Watch my feet.

136
00:15:09,215 --> 00:15:12,945
What a stick you are.
Careful with your feet.

137
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,584
Now turn around.
This is a renvers.

138
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,420
See, you did it.

139
00:15:28,322 --> 00:15:29,747
My big boy.

140
00:15:38,466 --> 00:15:43,187
Play only for me

141
00:15:45,293 --> 00:15:48,154
o gypsy violin

142
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:50,492
you know this song?

143
00:15:50,748 --> 00:15:53,075
Never heard it before.

144
00:15:53,492 --> 00:15:55,080
- You like it?
- I sure do.

145
00:15:59,552 --> 00:16:03,663
If you only knew
who used to sing this song.

146
00:16:03,828 --> 00:16:05,992
Who used to sing it? My father?

147
00:16:06,156 --> 00:16:09,560
- How did you know?
- It was easy to guess.

148
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,111
So it's true -
you do go with women.

149
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,052
It's them that come to me.
But i'm not interested.

150
00:16:22,298 --> 00:16:23,820
About your father -

151
00:16:25,296 --> 00:16:26,948
guess what i dreamt last night.

152
00:16:28,837 --> 00:16:32,654
I dreamt we were
up in the mountains in greece.

153
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:34,929
First it was full of mud.

154
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,460
Then we came to a hill
covered in rosemary,

155
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:40,218
and a voice called out,

156
00:16:40,385 --> 00:16:42,582
"mamma roma, come here."

157
00:16:43,925 --> 00:16:45,611
It was your father's voice.

158
00:16:46,733 --> 00:16:47,874
Just imagine.

159
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:52,282
Yes, i walked
towards your father's voice,

160
00:16:52,443 --> 00:16:56,293
and on the other side of the hill,
who do you think i saw?

161
00:16:56,462 --> 00:16:57,919
- Who?
- You.

162
00:16:58,823 --> 00:17:00,192
But you were a policeman.

163
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:03,573
- What did i do?
- You wanted to put me in jail.

164
00:17:03,735 --> 00:17:05,138
And what did you do?

165
00:17:05,394 --> 00:17:08,995
I ran away as fast as i could.

166
00:17:09,732 --> 00:17:14,834
Just look at this rascal,
wanting to arrest his mother!

167
00:17:19,749 --> 00:17:23,859
You're getting the hang of it now.
I'll teach you a trick.

168
00:17:26,033 --> 00:17:28,774
Watch this.
We'll do a casch now.

169
00:17:36,911 --> 00:17:39,423
Some casch that turned out to be!

170
00:17:46,002 --> 00:17:48,580
I landed on my butt, thanks to you.

171
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:02,743
Don't worry. I just want to talk.
Don't get any funny ideas.

172
00:18:03,866 --> 00:18:06,542
Talk? Then make it quick.

173
00:18:06,706 --> 00:18:08,162
Why don't we go inside?

174
00:18:09,513 --> 00:18:12,438
- My son's inside.
- So you're happy, i suppose.

175
00:18:16,276 --> 00:18:18,853
I was just about his age
when you and i started up.

176
00:18:19,018 --> 00:18:20,987
My son is an angel.

177
00:18:21,156 --> 00:18:23,288
I was just a kid.

178
00:18:25,877 --> 00:18:27,878
I was so innocent.

179
00:18:28,047 --> 00:18:31,135
My mother always told me
i was the best one of all.

180
00:18:33,756 --> 00:18:37,738
But all i did was disappoint her,
and all because of you.

181
00:18:37,904 --> 00:18:40,829
A stolen tear

182
00:18:40,998 --> 00:18:43,575
watch it there or i'll kill you.

183
00:18:44,634 --> 00:18:45,874
I'll kill you!

184
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,427
Go ahead and sing again
if you dare!

185
00:18:53,247 --> 00:18:56,620
The honeymoon wasn't even over
and there was already trouble.

186
00:18:57,426 --> 00:18:59,308
Come on. Cut to the chase.

187
00:18:59,467 --> 00:19:02,176
It's nothing much.

188
00:19:02,977 --> 00:19:05,652
My mother-in-law promised
to find me a job.

189
00:19:05,816 --> 00:19:08,904
Instead, some friends i met there,
three hicks,

190
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:11,647
want me to sell livestock with them.

191
00:19:12,738 --> 00:19:14,675
Horses, a few cows.

192
00:19:14,843 --> 00:19:18,509
They've been in business for a while,
and they've made some money.

193
00:19:19,788 --> 00:19:21,724
We buy the animals
for next to nothing,

194
00:19:21,893 --> 00:19:25,178
then we slaughter them in secret
and sell the meat in rome.

195
00:19:26,614 --> 00:19:30,148
How much do you need?
You know i don't have any money.

196
00:19:30,315 --> 00:19:31,718
Two hundred thousand.

197
00:19:31,878 --> 00:19:36,142
I can't. I spent it on the house,

198
00:19:36,312 --> 00:19:38,129
and on the license
for the stall at the market.

199
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:41,575
Are you kidding me?
Don't you understand?

200
00:19:42,725 --> 00:19:45,138
Do i have to teach you
how to make money?

201
00:19:46,042 --> 00:19:47,119
Have you forgotten?

202
00:19:48,434 --> 00:19:50,500
Haven't you had enough already?

203
00:19:55,102 --> 00:19:56,439
Why make a fuss?

204
00:19:56,601 --> 00:20:00,549
If you put your mind to it,
you can make that much in 10 days.

205
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,529
I'm counting on you.

206
00:20:23,141 --> 00:20:24,990
I'll be back in two weeks.

207
00:20:25,151 --> 00:20:27,184
Then i swear
you won't see me again.

208
00:21:16,413 --> 00:21:18,546
How you like to dance, my son.

209
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:40,839
What an ugly view.
All you see is the cemetery.

210
00:21:45,028 --> 00:21:46,778
I was planning on moving tomorrow,

211
00:21:48,091 --> 00:21:51,081
but now we'll have to wait
two more weeks.

212
00:21:53,162 --> 00:21:56,447
So what? We'll have fun later.

213
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:06,553
- Good-bye. I'm leaving.
- Who cares?

214
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,754
I'm off for good.
No hard feelings.

215
00:22:09,718 --> 00:22:12,427
It's all yours, darlings!

216
00:22:14,088 --> 00:22:17,014
Leaving us just like that?

217
00:22:17,183 --> 00:22:19,151
- Good-bye, biancofiore.
- No turning back?

218
00:22:19,321 --> 00:22:20,843
You're the best of the bunch.

219
00:22:22,288 --> 00:22:25,593
Good luck.
- Have another drink, on me.

220
00:22:30,421 --> 00:22:31,791
What a lush.

221
00:22:32,431 --> 00:22:33,834
To your health!

222
00:22:34,345 --> 00:22:37,597
You'll need it
with all these diseases around.

223
00:22:39,321 --> 00:22:42,694
So long, biancofiore!
So long, dolls!

224
00:22:48,955 --> 00:22:52,141
- Who are you looking for?
- Just out to get some air.

225
00:22:53,931 --> 00:22:55,867
- I'm not hustling.
- It's about time.

226
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:02,029
What are you laughing about?
- I like you.

227
00:23:03,725 --> 00:23:06,911
In all my years here,
nobody ever knew who i was.

228
00:23:07,074 --> 00:23:09,522
Get it all off your chest.

229
00:23:13,263 --> 00:23:16,635
There was a neighbor of ours,
a rich old man

230
00:23:17,443 --> 00:23:19,541
with loads of money.

231
00:23:20,471 --> 00:23:23,496
He dressed like robespierre.
He had a mustache and cane,

232
00:23:23,663 --> 00:23:26,022
like he was a king.

233
00:23:26,533 --> 00:23:28,469
You know how he made his money?

234
00:23:28,734 --> 00:23:30,256
Under fascism.

235
00:23:30,426 --> 00:23:32,720
Mussolini told him,

236
00:23:32,881 --> 00:23:35,742
"build a district for the working class."

237
00:23:36,805 --> 00:23:39,002
That became pietrarancio.

238
00:23:39,165 --> 00:23:40,471
Your turn!

239
00:23:40,633 --> 00:23:44,200
The walls in the first house
he built were great.

240
00:23:44,844 --> 00:23:49,847
So were the toilets. You could eat
from them, they were built so well.

241
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:55,336
Mussolini came back and said,
"that's just what i wanted."

242
00:23:56,073 --> 00:23:58,270
The son of a bitch.

243
00:23:58,434 --> 00:24:00,946
As soon as mussolini leaves,
he stops building houses

244
00:24:01,113 --> 00:24:02,603
and just makes toilets.

245
00:24:03,314 --> 00:24:06,272
They called the district "latrinia."

246
00:24:10,108 --> 00:24:14,883
Nothing but concrete tombs
as far as the eye could see.

247
00:24:15,755 --> 00:24:19,736
God, was that old man ugly!

248
00:24:19,902 --> 00:24:24,079
Some disease in africa
had pockmarked his whole face.

249
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:30,422
He had asthma, rheumatism,
a bad heart, colitis, diabetes.

250
00:24:30,588 --> 00:24:32,850
He stank to high heaven!

251
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:34,568
Was he a christian at least?

252
00:24:36,298 --> 00:24:38,973
He was 65 and i was 14.

253
00:24:39,138 --> 00:24:41,998
I got married
in a young fascist girl's uniform!

254
00:24:43,317 --> 00:24:45,067
No problems after the fall of fascism?

255
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:50,388
He was so old! You'd have thought
he only had two days to live.

256
00:24:50,557 --> 00:24:53,200
Foaming at the mouth.
- Look who's here, mamma roma.

257
00:24:53,365 --> 00:24:56,867
He's gonna die on me.
He's gonna die!

258
00:24:57,129 --> 00:24:59,032
He's dying!

259
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:02,861
- Who's dying, mamma roma?
- The old man they made me marry.

260
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:07,620
- What an outrage! An old man?
- They made me. He was my husband.

261
00:25:07,784 --> 00:25:11,569
And you didn't fight it?
If they'd done that to me -

262
00:25:11,738 --> 00:25:14,828
oh, sure, you think
you're smarter than me?

263
00:25:16,843 --> 00:25:18,942
I'd have liked to see you in my shoes.

264
00:25:19,107 --> 00:25:21,653
My mother was probably right
in making me marry him.

265
00:25:21,819 --> 00:25:24,712
- What a lousy mother!
- "He's got millions," she'd tell me.

266
00:25:24,882 --> 00:25:29,624
"He's rich. Seventy years old.

267
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:31,130
He'll die on you.

268
00:25:31,293 --> 00:25:35,078
What's the matter with you?
Don't you want to be a lady?

269
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,935
You can pick the next one."

270
00:25:37,099 --> 00:25:40,504
You slept with him?
Shame on you.

271
00:25:40,672 --> 00:25:42,489
He was probably a sadist too.

272
00:25:44,341 --> 00:25:45,961
You want to know something?

273
00:25:46,925 --> 00:25:49,306
My mother's dead,
and so's my father,

274
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,724
but the old guy's still alive,
damn him!

275
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,238
That's why i took up this life.

276
00:26:02,204 --> 00:26:06,054
I'm going. Good night!

277
00:26:07,022 --> 00:26:10,752
I've paid my dues in this world,
and the next one, too.

278
00:26:11,423 --> 00:26:14,229
I'm leaving for good!
Cha-cha-cha.

279
00:26:14,487 --> 00:26:15,563
So long!

280
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:20,507
Take it easy. Still dancing
the cha-cha-cha at your age?

281
00:26:20,675 --> 00:26:23,535
It's scandalous.

282
00:26:23,705 --> 00:26:27,752
- Scandalous for who?
- For the hypocrites, of course.

283
00:26:27,916 --> 00:26:30,657
Screw you and the hypocrites both!

284
00:26:38,954 --> 00:26:41,466
It's a different world here.

285
00:26:43,163 --> 00:26:47,243
That beautiful lady over there
owns a beauty parlor near our home.

286
00:26:47,407 --> 00:26:50,267
That man's a big-shot monarchist.

287
00:26:50,438 --> 00:26:53,809
That man over there owns a restaurant.

288
00:27:25,209 --> 00:27:28,014
I'll marry you off
to that one's daughter.

289
00:27:29,163 --> 00:27:31,676
That runt over there?
Look at her.

290
00:27:32,864 --> 00:27:36,975
Why not? She's the right type of girl.
You should marry someone like that.

291
00:27:40,329 --> 00:27:41,916
No way will i marry her.

292
00:27:42,626 --> 00:27:45,301
Be quiet. You still wet the bed.

293
00:27:56,916 --> 00:27:59,494
Isn't our new home beautiful?

294
00:28:00,426 --> 00:28:02,208
What did i tell you?

295
00:28:12,803 --> 00:28:14,293
Say hello to them.

296
00:28:24,893 --> 00:28:29,548
- Ettore, are you coming out later?
- Yes, he'll be right there.

297
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,249
Here.

298
00:28:40,108 --> 00:28:42,077
Take this, my little pimp.

299
00:29:29,681 --> 00:29:31,530
Give me that hat.

300
00:29:35,965 --> 00:29:37,041
Come on.

301
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:48,434
See her? Her name's bruna.

302
00:29:48,598 --> 00:29:50,697
Why tell me?

303
00:29:50,863 --> 00:29:53,788
She's something.
Everybody knows it.

304
00:29:53,957 --> 00:29:55,066
You can ask them.

305
00:29:55,233 --> 00:29:58,257
Everybody goes with her,
even the garbage men.

306
00:29:58,424 --> 00:30:00,620
She's good-iooking, though.
You should see her legs.

307
00:30:01,358 --> 00:30:02,564
Come on, we'll introduce you.

308
00:30:12,969 --> 00:30:15,547
Hi, bruna. How are you?
What are you doing here?

309
00:30:15,712 --> 00:30:18,039
I brought the baby out
for some fresh air.

310
00:30:22,411 --> 00:30:24,228
Look how cute he is.

311
00:30:25,793 --> 00:30:29,871
When are you boys
going to have one like him?

312
00:30:33,034 --> 00:30:36,406
Isn't that pretty? Let me see.

313
00:30:36,575 --> 00:30:39,152
- Don't touch. It's dangerous.
- It's a skull. How ugly.

314
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:42,212
Is it porcelain? Can i have it?

315
00:30:42,381 --> 00:30:44,643
Are you crazy?

316
00:30:44,805 --> 00:30:46,807
You're so mean.

317
00:30:48,345 --> 00:30:49,934
I want to introduce you to a friend.

318
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:52,553
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm ettore.

319
00:30:53,546 --> 00:30:56,884
He's a good guy, like us.
He told me he likes you.

320
00:30:57,662 --> 00:30:59,445
That's not true.

321
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,834
Have you lived here long?
I've never seen you.

322
00:31:01,999 --> 00:31:04,032
Not long.

323
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,359
Where did you live before?

324
00:31:07,231 --> 00:31:08,372
In guidonia.

325
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:12,901
His mother's the brunette
with the new stall near yours.

326
00:31:13,069 --> 00:31:15,842
Signora roma?
Such a good-iooking woman.

327
00:31:16,003 --> 00:31:18,896
I know her.
You work with her?

328
00:31:19,066 --> 00:31:21,741
No, i don't.

329
00:31:24,266 --> 00:31:25,189
Look.

330
00:31:26,275 --> 00:31:28,439
It's maria and assunta
and their friends.

331
00:31:28,604 --> 00:31:29,615
Let's go.

332
00:31:48,828 --> 00:31:50,350
Assunta, where are you going?

333
00:31:51,094 --> 00:31:52,649
Dancing.

334
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:57,376
Damn, it was only a vision.

335
00:31:57,537 --> 00:31:58,842
Got any money?

336
00:31:59,005 --> 00:32:00,690
None at all.

337
00:32:00,855 --> 00:32:03,715
If we had some,
we could go see a show.

338
00:32:03,885 --> 00:32:07,670
Let's go see the whores
in caracalla and have a few laughs.

339
00:32:07,841 --> 00:32:09,526
Let's go!

340
00:32:22,419 --> 00:32:26,748
There's a black girl who likes me
and gives me smokes.

341
00:32:26,916 --> 00:32:29,243
Have you ever been
with one of them?

342
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:32,809
One used to come to guidonia,
for the soldiers.

343
00:32:35,913 --> 00:32:38,142
There's arsenal and thunderbolt.
What's going on?

344
00:32:38,784 --> 00:32:40,372
Listen.

345
00:32:40,538 --> 00:32:42,126
Can i talk to you?

346
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,003
Is it safe?

347
00:32:45,163 --> 00:32:47,872
Wait for us a minute, ettore.
We have to talk.

348
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:54,917
You're patient.
You can wait, eh?

349
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,862
Are you guys up
for a job at the hospital?

350
00:33:12,502 --> 00:33:17,244
It's visiting hours for relatives.
We pretend we're visiting someone.

351
00:33:17,414 --> 00:33:19,546
We look for a good target,

352
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:22,125
walk by his bedside table
and grab his things.

353
00:33:23,061 --> 00:33:26,280
We have to be careful, though.
Some don't have any visitors,

354
00:33:26,442 --> 00:33:30,868
but they don't want to look ionely,
so they pretend to be asleep.

355
00:33:31,035 --> 00:33:33,547
But we'll be careful.
Are you in?

356
00:33:33,715 --> 00:33:38,208
- Shall we try it?
- Sure. Can't go anywhere without money.

357
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:52,787
See you tonight, ettore.
We have stuff to do.

358
00:34:28,391 --> 00:34:30,077
Ettore.

359
00:36:24,188 --> 00:36:27,342
Ettore, what are you doing here?

360
00:36:30,696 --> 00:36:34,297
I saw you from my window.
Right over there.

361
00:36:39,563 --> 00:36:44,153
My baby fell asleep, so i took him home.
What are you doing here?

362
00:36:44,317 --> 00:36:46,318
Just wandering around.

363
00:36:47,921 --> 00:36:49,128
Bruna...

364
00:36:51,047 --> 00:36:53,592
do you have a father and mother?
- Of course. Why?

365
00:37:00,139 --> 00:37:05,174
God knows where those boys took you.
Watch out - they're a bad bunch.

366
00:37:08,242 --> 00:37:11,080
- Do you like it?
- Yes. Can i have it?

367
00:37:14,589 --> 00:37:16,851
Take it. I've had it for ages.

368
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,470
What use is it to me?
Just something i found.

369
00:37:22,596 --> 00:37:25,108
This one's better than the skull.

370
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:28,615
Death is horrible.
Are you afraid of death?

371
00:37:30,507 --> 00:37:33,759
No. When i was a kid,
i almost died a few times.

372
00:37:33,921 --> 00:37:38,576
I had pneumonia and pleurisy.
I didn't even know i was dying.

373
00:37:45,438 --> 00:37:48,722
Tomorrow i'll give you another present.
How much does a gold chain cost?

374
00:37:50,573 --> 00:37:52,062
Three or four thousand lira.

375
00:37:53,093 --> 00:37:55,029
I'll bring you one tomorrow.

376
00:37:55,325 --> 00:37:57,326
Shall we take a little walk?

377
00:39:00,848 --> 00:39:03,904
I love to hear the crickets sing.

378
00:39:05,282 --> 00:39:07,164
They're not crickets.
They're cicadas.

379
00:39:07,324 --> 00:39:09,009
You're right.

380
00:39:14,756 --> 00:39:15,832
What's that?

381
00:39:19,605 --> 00:39:21,258
A finch.

382
00:39:25,667 --> 00:39:28,309
What's the one that goes
cheep- cheep- chew?

383
00:39:31,887 --> 00:39:32,832
A lark.

384
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,979
How do you know them all?

385
00:39:35,141 --> 00:39:38,262
I know them pretty well.
I used to steal their nests.

386
00:39:38,426 --> 00:39:41,134
It was full of them where i used to live.
I killed plenty with my sling.

387
00:39:41,297 --> 00:39:45,179
Yeah, you lived with the hicks.
Did your mother visit you?

388
00:39:45,348 --> 00:39:47,730
Who cares about my mother?

389
00:39:49,782 --> 00:39:52,807
She's still so beautiful,
her hair still so black.

390
00:39:52,972 --> 00:39:57,150
How old is she?
- Who knows? Maybe 43.

391
00:40:06,944 --> 00:40:08,761
Have you ever been with a woman?

392
00:40:11,857 --> 00:40:14,979
Then you don't even know
how women are made.

393
00:40:16,833 --> 00:40:18,171
How are you made?

394
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:20,431
If you only knew.

395
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,839
Where are we going, to america?

396
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:28,437
Can't wait, can you?
Your heart's pounding, right?

397
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:33,959
I bet your heart's beating hard.
- Stop it.

398
00:40:37,346 --> 00:40:40,880
Let's go down there, behind that door.
That's where i always go.

399
00:40:41,045 --> 00:40:42,927
It's a nice place.

400
00:40:52,306 --> 00:40:54,536
Can you hear that?

401
00:40:54,698 --> 00:40:58,037
Even i know what that one is.
It's a cuckoo.

402
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:10,038
Look at these fava beans here!

403
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:12,681
Buy my fava beans! They're fresh!

404
00:41:16,454 --> 00:41:18,813
Look at these artichokes!
Stop and buy!

405
00:41:22,165 --> 00:41:26,787
Signora roma, what a voice you have.
You could sing mass.

406
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:30,006
Hey, potato vendor,
let me shout. I'm happy.

407
00:41:30,172 --> 00:41:33,641
Of course you are,
with a handsome man next to you.

408
00:41:33,808 --> 00:41:38,714
Look at these figs.
I've got the best ones.

409
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,533
Signora roma.

410
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:42,287
Do you know that girl?

411
00:41:45,706 --> 00:41:48,480
- Who is she?
- Do you like her?

412
00:41:49,694 --> 00:41:51,727
Looks like a monkey.

413
00:41:53,426 --> 00:41:57,570
Listen. Let me tell you the score.

414
00:42:08,483 --> 00:42:11,604
That's why i had a boy.
Who's she cheating on?

415
00:42:11,769 --> 00:42:13,618
All of rome.

416
00:42:23,539 --> 00:42:27,585
When will you give her
your blessing as your daughter-in-law?

417
00:42:27,751 --> 00:42:29,306
You take my son for a fool?

418
00:42:29,473 --> 00:42:32,844
No, he's no fool.
He's buying her a gold chain.

419
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:38,495
Look at these figs.
Come and buy, ladies.

420
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:45,510
Hurry up and buy
so we can go home early.

421
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:48,800
Don't make me yell anymore.
I've had enough.

422
00:42:59,394 --> 00:43:01,460
What's wrong?
What are you doing here?

423
00:43:01,628 --> 00:43:04,586
He's not here for you.

424
00:43:04,754 --> 00:43:07,745
He's drawn like a magnet.

425
00:43:07,912 --> 00:43:09,946
- What do you want?
- Nothing.

426
00:43:10,114 --> 00:43:11,669
What are you doing here then?

427
00:43:11,835 --> 00:43:14,925
I need 1,000 lire.

428
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:17,058
You think money grows on trees?

429
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:21,555
How about a good slap instead?
What do you need it for?

430
00:43:22,873 --> 00:43:26,506
- I don't need it anymore.
- I know why you wanted it.

431
00:43:27,658 --> 00:43:30,648
Fool. At your age, the only woman
you need is your mother.

432
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:34,668
Forget about women.

433
00:43:34,836 --> 00:43:37,511
You don't have the brains
to understand them.

434
00:43:37,675 --> 00:43:39,045
They're all tramps!

435
00:43:39,812 --> 00:43:41,269
Each worse than the one before.

436
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:45,959
Is that clear?
If not, i'll make it real clear for you.

437
00:43:47,883 --> 00:43:52,310
Come and buy, ladies.
- Damn, what a voice you have.

438
00:45:54,939 --> 00:45:57,005
Got something to sell?
Come here.

439
00:46:29,232 --> 00:46:31,940
I've got some records.
Wanna buy them?

440
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:35,764
I buy everything.
Show me what you've got.

441
00:46:36,569 --> 00:46:37,994
What are they?

442
00:46:39,568 --> 00:46:43,233
They're no good to me.
I don't have a record player.

443
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:09,007
O gypsy with your look
so sad and soulful

444
00:47:10,766 --> 00:47:15,453
you make your violin weep
in your hands

445
00:47:16,444 --> 00:47:20,686
play once more a sweet serenade

446
00:47:22,793 --> 00:47:25,946
where did you swipe this from?
I haven't heard it in 20 years.

447
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:29,231
I didn't swipe it.
Our place is full of them.

448
00:47:29,395 --> 00:47:30,798
We don't have any use for them.

449
00:47:30,959 --> 00:47:35,418
I'll buy anything, even rocks.

450
00:47:35,584 --> 00:47:39,695
Even stolen goods.
I don't care. I buy them anyway.

451
00:47:40,497 --> 00:47:42,432
You can find me here anytime.

452
00:47:43,016 --> 00:47:44,506
Here.

453
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:48,180
I pay top price, so remember,

454
00:47:48,344 --> 00:47:53,446
gennarino, the second-hand dealer,
will make you rich.

455
00:48:26,304 --> 00:48:28,022
You in a bad mood?

456
00:48:29,144 --> 00:48:32,907
Remember the kid i had with me?
He's sick, poor thing.

457
00:48:34,215 --> 00:48:38,326
The doctor says he might die.
I can't live without him, poor little angel.

458
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:43,265
Even if he dies, he's too small
to understand. How old is he?

459
00:48:44,359 --> 00:48:48,090
- Two years and four months.
- He's still a baby.

460
00:48:49,815 --> 00:48:52,838
And how old are you?
- Twenty- four.

461
00:48:53,579 --> 00:48:58,038
Six and a half years older than me.
You're not very well developed.

462
00:48:58,205 --> 00:49:00,815
Neither are you.
You look like a kid.

463
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:04,863
Of course. When i was small,
i was always in the hospital.

464
00:49:05,031 --> 00:49:06,749
Now i go to the gym.

465
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,435
What are you looking at?

466
00:49:13,038 --> 00:49:15,170
This is for you, like i promised.

467
00:49:22,863 --> 00:49:26,528
- Is that the madonna on it?
- The madonna and child.

468
00:49:40,759 --> 00:49:44,326
I'm not worried that my son
is running after that crazy girl.

469
00:49:44,491 --> 00:49:48,309
I can always get rid of her
if i put my mind to it.

470
00:49:48,478 --> 00:49:51,948
Even if he steals my records
and things from the house.

471
00:49:52,115 --> 00:49:56,161
I'll beat that habit out of him.

472
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:00,053
Don't you think he deserves it?
- Why not?

473
00:50:00,217 --> 00:50:04,992
Father, i came here because
you're the only one that can help me.

474
00:50:05,928 --> 00:50:08,951
They say only priests
can find jobs for people.

475
00:50:09,118 --> 00:50:12,653
That's what they say,
but us poor priests don't count at all.

476
00:50:12,818 --> 00:50:16,103
You do count, father.
Don't be modest.

477
00:50:16,264 --> 00:50:18,972
If you say so, modesty aside.

478
00:50:20,155 --> 00:50:21,809
My son needs a job.

479
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:24,843
I can't have him grow up
on the street like this.

480
00:50:25,004 --> 00:50:27,548
He can't become a delinquent.

481
00:50:27,715 --> 00:50:31,119
He's my only child, my only hope.

482
00:50:31,289 --> 00:50:34,954
What does he know how to do?
Has he studied and learned a trade?

483
00:50:45,802 --> 00:50:47,552
He grew up by himself.

484
00:50:49,726 --> 00:50:51,444
His father wasn't around.

485
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:54,533
I've had to work to support him.

486
00:50:54,703 --> 00:50:56,008
It'll be hard, then.

487
00:50:56,170 --> 00:51:00,314
I might find him a job as a laborer
on some construction site,

488
00:51:00,477 --> 00:51:02,510
but that's all i can do.

489
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:05,538
You must be joking.

490
00:51:06,283 --> 00:51:09,371
I didn't bring him into this world
to be a laborer.

491
00:51:11,482 --> 00:51:14,734
I want a decent job for him,
one with a future.

492
00:51:14,896 --> 00:51:18,658
You can't make something
out of nothing.

493
00:51:18,819 --> 00:51:22,353
You want to build his future
out of nothing?

494
00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:23,498
I know, father.

495
00:51:23,668 --> 00:51:26,343
But don't you know that man

496
00:51:26,506 --> 00:51:29,661
who comes to mass here, pellissier?

497
00:51:29,824 --> 00:51:32,272
He has a wife and daughter.
Don't you know him?

498
00:51:32,439 --> 00:51:34,505
Of course. He's a regular.

499
00:51:36,077 --> 00:51:40,090
He has one of the best restaurants
in trastevere,

500
00:51:40,256 --> 00:51:43,660
where classy people go to eat,
like actresses and lawyers.

501
00:51:43,828 --> 00:51:48,006
Couldn't you ask him
to give my son a job?

502
00:51:48,167 --> 00:51:49,656
Don't you understand?

503
00:51:49,825 --> 00:51:54,448
You have a serious responsibility
toward your son.

504
00:51:55,216 --> 00:51:57,446
What are you doing
about this responsibility?

505
00:51:57,609 --> 00:51:59,610
What should i do?

506
00:51:59,779 --> 00:52:01,149
It's quite simple.

507
00:52:01,309 --> 00:52:04,267
Start again humbly from zero.

508
00:52:04,436 --> 00:52:08,133
Send him to school. Teach him a trade.
That's what's important.

509
00:52:08,296 --> 00:52:09,884
A trade?

510
00:52:13,337 --> 00:52:14,543
Will you promise?

511
00:52:16,558 --> 00:52:18,592
I'll do everything i can.

512
00:52:19,587 --> 00:52:21,143
I promise.

513
00:52:21,311 --> 00:52:22,169
Good-bye, father.

514
00:52:22,331 --> 00:52:23,756
Good-bye.

515
00:52:30,115 --> 00:52:32,018
Watch out. He's got an ace.

516
00:52:33,241 --> 00:52:34,447
It's my turn.

517
00:52:37,037 --> 00:52:39,583
Play a card. Wake up.
I'm already losing 500 lire.

518
00:52:39,749 --> 00:52:41,173
Which one? They're all lousy.

519
00:52:44,056 --> 00:52:44,915
Here comes bruna.

520
00:52:48,393 --> 00:52:50,079
Hi, bruna. Don't even say hello?

521
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:52,348
She's acting stuck up.

522
00:52:53,083 --> 00:52:55,018
You looking for daisies?

523
00:52:55,731 --> 00:52:57,732
No, i'm looking for lizards.

524
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,351
I'm not playing anymore.

525
00:53:03,864 --> 00:53:05,453
Quitting while you're ahead?

526
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:07,939
Take my place.

527
00:53:20,613 --> 00:53:21,657
Look who's here.

528
00:53:21,825 --> 00:53:24,239
Aren't you going to school anymore?

529
00:53:26,035 --> 00:53:27,972
I'm already sick of it.
What's the use?

530
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,621
Don't you like it?

531
00:53:31,522 --> 00:53:33,621
I don't understand a thing.

532
00:53:33,883 --> 00:53:36,808
It's boring
and it gives me a headache.

533
00:53:36,977 --> 00:53:38,533
You don't want to study.

534
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,450
You don't want to learn a trade.

535
00:53:40,614 --> 00:53:44,910
I know what your mother says.
She's always crying.

536
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:47,940
Don't worry.
I didn't ask her to cry.

537
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:50,688
You're right. School's a pain.

538
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:52,636
But you love your mother, don't you?

539
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,312
What do i care about her?

540
00:53:56,596 --> 00:53:58,759
Shame on you.

541
00:53:59,625 --> 00:54:01,691
I love her a little, though.

542
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:06,733
- How do you know?
- Because i'd cry if she died.

543
00:54:07,632 --> 00:54:11,233
- I didn't expect you'd be laughing.
- Shall we go?

544
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,615
Keep walking. Ignore them.

545
00:54:54,589 --> 00:54:55,535
Where are you going?

546
00:54:56,982 --> 00:54:58,124
Why?

547
00:54:58,291 --> 00:55:00,073
We'll tag along.

548
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:04,411
- We have to talk in private.
- We do, too. Right, bruna?

549
00:55:04,574 --> 00:55:05,998
What do you have to tell me?

550
00:55:06,169 --> 00:55:09,323
The story of little red riding hood.

551
00:55:09,487 --> 00:55:10,976
Let's go, bruna.

552
00:55:12,197 --> 00:55:15,037
Are you leaving us high and dry?

553
00:55:15,197 --> 00:55:17,491
Just like the germans,
you come and take over.

554
00:55:18,291 --> 00:55:20,292
Why don't you get lost?

555
00:55:21,896 --> 00:55:23,385
Oh, yeah?

556
00:55:26,011 --> 00:55:28,045
Then we'll take bruna with us.

557
00:55:28,211 --> 00:55:30,659
I don't feel like doing anything.

558
00:55:31,179 --> 00:55:32,581
But we do.

559
00:55:36,506 --> 00:55:38,388
Leave me alone!

560
00:55:38,802 --> 00:55:41,695
I'll tell your parents
if you don't leave me alone!

561
00:55:41,865 --> 00:55:44,279
Leave her alone, you bastards!

562
00:55:44,449 --> 00:55:46,614
Can't you see she doesn't want
to go with you?

563
00:55:46,778 --> 00:55:49,834
What's the matter with you?

564
00:55:49,999 --> 00:55:54,264
You'd never act like this
if you were alone, damn you!

565
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:55,836
Who are you talking to?

566
00:55:55,997 --> 00:55:59,021
Stop it now,
or i'll punch you one.

567
00:55:59,187 --> 00:56:03,103
Come and try if you dare,
damn you!

568
00:56:12,043 --> 00:56:14,750
Leave him alone!
What's he done? You idiots!

569
00:56:15,488 --> 00:56:17,108
Let me go!

570
00:56:20,783 --> 00:56:23,643
What are you doing?
You'll hurt each other.

571
00:56:30,003 --> 00:56:31,460
Leave him alone.
What are you doing?

572
00:56:39,923 --> 00:56:42,914
Picking on someone
smaller than yourself, eh?

573
00:56:46,494 --> 00:56:48,626
Bye, ettore.
See you tomorrow.

574
00:57:25,539 --> 00:57:28,019
God, you look horrible!

575
00:57:29,431 --> 00:57:31,020
Has work done that to you?

576
00:57:34,919 --> 00:57:38,138
Biancofiore, i need your help.
Would you blackmail a guy for me?

577
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:41,041
Sure, but you have to ask my man.

578
00:57:41,202 --> 00:57:44,868
He's over there.
Call him before he leaves.

579
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:48,500
- Zaccaria, come here.
- What's up?

580
00:57:49,273 --> 00:57:51,155
Come here, biancofiore.

581
00:57:55,366 --> 00:57:56,290
Listen up, okay?

582
00:57:56,451 --> 00:58:01,323
"Big-tooth maria" used to go
with this tall guy named cesare

583
00:58:01,491 --> 00:58:03,339
before you worked this area.

584
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,827
Have you ever seen him?
- No, i don't know him.

585
00:58:05,988 --> 00:58:07,706
Look who's here.

586
00:58:07,871 --> 00:58:10,580
Back on the battlefield?

587
00:58:11,315 --> 00:58:14,622
No, i want to talk to you.
I have to play a joke on a guy.

588
00:58:14,792 --> 00:58:17,631
She's game. Are you?

589
00:58:17,792 --> 00:58:20,087
If it means money, sure.

590
00:58:20,248 --> 00:58:23,053
No, it's just a favor i need.

591
00:58:23,215 --> 00:58:27,097
Don't worry. Whatever she loses
i'll make up to you.

592
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,170
Go ahead. I'm listening.

593
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:32,329
Send your woman to this guy
who's never seen her before,

594
00:58:32,497 --> 00:58:34,945
this wealthy guy
who can help my son.

595
00:58:35,114 --> 00:58:36,701
That's why i'm doing this.

596
00:58:36,868 --> 00:58:40,816
While he's with your woman,
you and i show up.

597
00:58:40,983 --> 00:58:43,821
You pretend you're her brother
or her husband.

598
00:58:43,982 --> 00:58:47,419
I'll be someone else -
your sister-in-law, anyone.

599
00:58:47,586 --> 00:58:49,587
We'll make a big scene.

600
00:58:49,851 --> 00:58:52,428
You get angry. I calm him down,

601
00:58:52,594 --> 00:58:54,889
and talk him into doing
what i want him to.

602
00:58:55,051 --> 00:58:58,172
But you have to scare him,
like you want to kill him.

603
00:58:58,337 --> 00:59:00,533
I understand.

604
00:59:01,048 --> 00:59:04,746
You get it all set up,
and then i'll take over.

605
00:59:07,332 --> 00:59:09,713
So long, mamma roma.
Don't worry.

606
00:59:13,458 --> 00:59:15,719
Back to work.
No playing around.

607
00:59:17,922 --> 00:59:19,412
Biancofiore,

608
00:59:20,475 --> 00:59:24,075
since you're doing me one favor,
would you do me another?

609
00:59:25,036 --> 00:59:28,768
Sure. That's what i do best -
favors for people.

610
00:59:29,949 --> 00:59:33,353
My son's got a crush, so to speak,

611
00:59:34,798 --> 00:59:37,637
on this crazy girl
who looks like a broom in drag.

612
00:59:37,796 --> 00:59:40,656
He's never been
with a woman before,

613
00:59:42,134 --> 00:59:43,820
so he's hooked, of course.

614
00:59:45,612 --> 00:59:46,340
First love.

615
00:59:46,505 --> 00:59:48,832
You have to be his second.

616
00:59:49,248 --> 00:59:52,141
You have to make him forget her,
even the way she smells.

617
00:59:53,810 --> 00:59:55,942
And you know what you're doing.

618
01:00:00,413 --> 01:00:01,816
I'll do it.

619
01:00:01,976 --> 01:00:05,675
Next time he sees her,
he'll spit in her face.

620
01:00:09,058 --> 01:00:12,528
There's the pig.
Right behind me.

621
01:00:22,712 --> 01:00:26,149
I'll take care of him.

622
01:00:26,986 --> 01:00:29,400
God, his face is so sallow.

623
01:00:34,578 --> 01:00:36,644
Look what a jewel my son is.

624
01:00:40,224 --> 01:00:43,411
You'd hang on the cross for him,
wouldn't you?

625
01:00:44,084 --> 01:00:45,324
You bet i would.

626
01:00:45,966 --> 01:00:49,632
What else is there in life?
I know it sounds incredible.

627
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:11,259
Go on, biancofiore. Get busy.

628
01:01:11,550 --> 01:01:13,039
See you tonight.

629
01:01:25,523 --> 01:01:27,427
Ettore, come here.

630
01:01:29,765 --> 01:01:32,407
Go and buy yourself a cappuccino.

631
01:01:32,572 --> 01:01:35,465
I'll only be a half hour.

632
01:01:38,155 --> 01:01:40,994
Listen, go and sleep
at biancofiore's tonight.

633
01:01:42,143 --> 01:01:44,883
She'll be waiting for you.
I'm busy this evening.

634
01:01:49,064 --> 01:01:52,283
See you in the morning. Okay?

635
01:01:53,466 --> 01:01:55,436
What am i going
to biancofiore's for?

636
01:01:55,603 --> 01:01:58,757
You'll thank your mother later.

637
01:01:58,921 --> 01:02:02,075
Whatever happened to carmine?

638
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:05,806
He's happy as he can be
hoeing the garden with those hicks.

639
01:02:05,971 --> 01:02:08,776
Leave him where he is.
Are you joking?

640
01:02:12,766 --> 01:02:14,289
What do you think they're doing?

641
01:02:34,426 --> 01:02:36,047
What are you doing?

642
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:38,891
You want me to let it down?

643
01:02:59,659 --> 01:03:02,019
I'll have you locked up, you schizo!

644
01:03:02,179 --> 01:03:04,985
What are you doing with my sister?

645
01:03:05,145 --> 01:03:07,115
How could i know she was your sister?

646
01:03:07,282 --> 01:03:09,925
I'm crazy! Certifiably crazy!

647
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:13,178
If i kill you, i'll go scot-free.
I'll kill you!

648
01:03:13,343 --> 01:03:17,423
He's not doing anything wrong.
You want to get in trouble?

649
01:03:17,587 --> 01:03:19,142
You got the nerve to talk?

650
01:03:21,319 --> 01:03:22,841
Are you serious?

651
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:25,815
How did you meet her?
What did you come here for?

652
01:03:25,976 --> 01:03:27,759
I just came -

653
01:03:27,921 --> 01:03:32,250
you didn't just show up here.
And you're not leaving here alive.

654
01:03:34,078 --> 01:03:35,861
I told you i'm mad!

655
01:03:36,025 --> 01:03:39,244
Zaccaria, what are you doing?
Are you crazy?

656
01:03:39,405 --> 01:03:42,940
Do it for mamma roma's sake.

657
01:03:43,107 --> 01:03:45,651
We'll all end up in jail.

658
01:03:46,137 --> 01:03:47,659
Wait, i know this guy.

659
01:03:47,828 --> 01:03:50,187
Aren't you
"big-tooth maria's" friend?

660
01:03:50,347 --> 01:03:54,806
I always wondered how you could go
with such an ugly woman.

661
01:03:54,972 --> 01:03:58,822
That was you, right?

662
01:03:58,993 --> 01:04:01,603
Zaccaria, i know him.

663
01:04:01,767 --> 01:04:04,986
He's a good person
with a great heart.

664
01:04:05,149 --> 01:04:08,206
He never refuses
to help someone if he can.

665
01:04:08,371 --> 01:04:10,600
You tell him, mamma roma.

666
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:15,539
Get dressed.

667
01:04:22,470 --> 01:04:28,812
"Pellissier, cesare.
Via capeletro 15."

668
01:04:28,978 --> 01:04:30,663
Ah, so you're married.

669
01:04:30,828 --> 01:04:33,340
You'll be seeing more of me.
This doesn't end here.

670
01:04:33,508 --> 01:04:35,030
Don't mind him.

671
01:04:38,037 --> 01:04:41,061
So you're the owner
of the trattoria ciceruacchio.

672
01:04:41,228 --> 01:04:45,339
Chicken, fettuccine.
That's good to know.

673
01:04:46,874 --> 01:04:49,038
You only carry
20,000 lira on you.

674
01:04:49,203 --> 01:04:50,247
Shame on you.

675
01:04:51,021 --> 01:04:53,380
I'll keep this for moral damages.

676
01:04:55,614 --> 01:04:56,625
Let's go.

677
01:04:58,071 --> 01:04:59,496
Best to get out of here.

678
01:05:19,763 --> 01:05:22,340
Wake up.

679
01:05:25,792 --> 01:05:27,574
Come and see the sun.

680
01:05:29,077 --> 01:05:30,981
Are you made of lead?

681
01:05:33,161 --> 01:05:39,023
Don't you realize that from today on
you're the head of the family?

682
01:05:40,147 --> 01:05:41,897
Don't feel like going to work?

683
01:05:42,762 --> 01:05:45,243
Don't you remember?
You start work today.

684
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,380
Say something.

685
01:05:47,547 --> 01:05:49,842
Aren't you glad
to be a working man?

686
01:05:53,895 --> 01:05:57,429
Come on, jump out of that bed.

687
01:05:57,596 --> 01:06:00,141
Let's go. Need a bugler?

688
01:06:00,403 --> 01:06:01,773
Come on!

689
01:06:07,133 --> 01:06:08,655
Can you ride a motorcycle?

690
01:06:08,825 --> 01:06:11,370
Sure, it's easy.

691
01:06:12,748 --> 01:06:14,531
You like riding motorcycles?

692
01:06:16,162 --> 01:06:17,651
Of course. Why?

693
01:06:17,820 --> 01:06:20,745
Hurry up with those trousers.

694
01:06:20,915 --> 01:06:22,949
You'd think it was your wedding day.

695
01:06:23,115 --> 01:06:24,540
Hurry up.

696
01:06:25,317 --> 01:06:28,786
Come down and see the present
your mother has for you.

697
01:07:05,511 --> 01:07:07,675
Isn't it beautiful?
Is it what you wanted?

698
01:07:10,583 --> 01:07:15,618
Go ahead and caress it.
I bet you like it better than a woman.

699
01:07:18,335 --> 01:07:20,335
Cat got your tongue?

700
01:07:24,204 --> 01:07:26,945
That's right, caress it.
What a great mother you have, right?

701
01:07:27,809 --> 01:07:28,918
Does it run?

702
01:07:31,541 --> 01:07:34,466
It better!
It cost 250,000 lira.

703
01:07:36,773 --> 01:07:39,100
- Get on.
- Shall we try it?

704
01:07:42,611 --> 01:07:47,450
- Hold on tight.
- Go slow.

705
01:07:47,618 --> 01:07:48,543
Slowly!

706
01:07:52,691 --> 01:07:54,507
You're going too fast.

707
01:07:55,658 --> 01:07:59,671
- Am i doing okay? You scared?
- No, but slow down.

708
01:08:00,953 --> 01:08:04,519
Hold on to my waist.
Put your hands here.

709
01:08:06,440 --> 01:08:10,073
- My hair's getting all messed up.
- So what? I've got a comb.

710
01:08:19,838 --> 01:08:24,101
See, you just have to use
your brains to get ahead.

711
01:08:25,452 --> 01:08:29,846
Soon you'll be driving a car
and you'll take me out for a drive.

712
01:08:30,716 --> 01:08:33,130
You know how to drive?
- I'll learn.

713
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:36,259
Just wait. Your mother
will make you into somebody.

714
01:08:36,999 --> 01:08:39,033
You'll be the envy of everyone.

715
01:08:40,477 --> 01:08:44,425
You'll like being the young gentleman.
- They're all stupid.

716
01:08:44,592 --> 01:08:46,560
I can't stand them.

717
01:08:46,825 --> 01:08:49,402
They've got some money,
so they think they're a big deal.

718
01:08:49,569 --> 01:08:51,537
So now you're a communist?

719
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:55,912
We won't get along
if you turn into a comrade

720
01:08:56,650 --> 01:08:59,227
and hang around
with those losers.

721
01:08:59,392 --> 01:09:00,763
You have to think like me.

722
01:09:00,924 --> 01:09:03,283
Watch me take this corner.

723
01:09:07,654 --> 01:09:12,081
Pass that car.
Go on, show them who you are.

724
01:09:12,249 --> 01:09:15,500
The bastards are cutting us off.

725
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:21,969
Jerks!

726
01:09:36,301 --> 01:09:40,566
Biancofiore, this is the first time
i've seen you since that night,

727
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:43,031
the night of deep sighs.

728
01:09:43,223 --> 01:09:45,224
We did a great job.

729
01:09:51,295 --> 01:09:55,373
But what about that night with my son?
Won't you tell me anything?

730
01:09:55,537 --> 01:09:57,222
Sure.

731
01:09:57,387 --> 01:10:01,020
He's a good little soldier, god bless him.
He's got a hearty appetite.

732
01:10:02,045 --> 01:10:03,633
I know that.

733
01:10:04,150 --> 01:10:06,825
But i mean bruna.
Did he say anything about her?

734
01:10:07,690 --> 01:10:09,343
Bruna who?

735
01:10:09,605 --> 01:10:12,693
After he saw me,
it was "good-bye, bruna."

736
01:10:12,858 --> 01:10:14,795
What kind of things
did he say to you?

737
01:10:14,963 --> 01:10:17,290
Lots of sweet things.

738
01:10:17,643 --> 01:10:19,165
That he likes me,

739
01:10:20,706 --> 01:10:23,033
and i'm beautiful,
and he wants to see me again.

740
01:10:23,290 --> 01:10:27,716
Oh, and that he'll take me to the zoo
on sunday to see the elephants.

741
01:10:31,042 --> 01:10:35,729
But did you get the feeling
it's over with bruna? Really over?

742
01:10:35,890 --> 01:10:37,956
Yes, i told you.

743
01:10:40,930 --> 01:10:41,876
Let's go.

744
01:10:54,137 --> 01:10:56,203
There he is, the cockroach.

745
01:11:00,389 --> 01:11:01,792
Where's ettore?

746
01:11:04,855 --> 01:11:07,182
Where is he? Do you see him?

747
01:11:07,599 --> 01:11:08,642
There he is.

748
01:12:12,292 --> 01:12:13,531
He's so handsome.

749
01:12:44,286 --> 01:12:47,343
What's this? Are you crying?

750
01:12:47,763 --> 01:12:49,482
What are you doing?

751
01:13:21,418 --> 01:13:23,681
You know where mamma roma lives?

752
01:13:23,843 --> 01:13:28,433
The market vendor
with the long, black, messy hair.

753
01:13:29,521 --> 01:13:31,815
- What's her last name?
- Garofolo.

754
01:13:31,978 --> 01:13:35,067
Her son ettore's
playing ball over here.

755
01:13:42,472 --> 01:13:45,278
Someone's looking for you.
Come here.

756
01:14:03,015 --> 01:14:05,081
You're mamma roma's son, right?

757
01:14:06,907 --> 01:14:07,919
What of it?

758
01:14:08,088 --> 01:14:11,525
Is your mother at home?
Tell me where she lives.

759
01:14:11,693 --> 01:14:15,935
Via calpurnio fiamma 47,
apartment 24.

760
01:14:18,902 --> 01:14:21,643
- You like wine?
- A little.

761
01:14:23,622 --> 01:14:26,484
When i come back,
we'll have some together.

762
01:14:50,388 --> 01:14:51,877
Do you sleep in the nude?

763
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:56,122
That's my business.
Can't i sleep as i please?

764
01:15:18,747 --> 01:15:22,031
- What do you want?
- Who was that talking to you?

765
01:15:22,191 --> 01:15:26,334
A waiter who works with me.

766
01:15:54,506 --> 01:15:56,192
Did you just see the devil or what?

767
01:16:08,765 --> 01:16:12,104
What do you want?
What are you here for?

768
01:16:14,571 --> 01:16:15,517
Peace of mind.

769
01:16:17,793 --> 01:16:19,131
My god!

770
01:16:19,961 --> 01:16:23,018
Don't you know i've got a son?

771
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:27,518
Yeah, we're friends.

772
01:16:27,777 --> 01:16:30,518
We're having a drink later.
He's waiting for me.

773
01:16:37,762 --> 01:16:40,024
Go ahead and have a good cry.

774
01:16:44,302 --> 01:16:46,237
You knew what i was like.

775
01:16:46,695 --> 01:16:49,402
You think i could have stayed
with those hicks?

776
01:16:52,946 --> 01:16:56,198
You should have known
i'd be back sooner or later.

777
01:16:56,902 --> 01:17:00,371
Pigs around the house,
chickens flying over the bed.

778
01:17:00,921 --> 01:17:03,280
You'd have done the same thing.

779
01:17:03,441 --> 01:17:06,779
You'd have run off
and sent them all to hell.

780
01:17:07,557 --> 01:17:10,298
I know you.
I know what you're like.

781
01:17:13,330 --> 01:17:17,408
With all the young girls in rome,
why come back to me?

782
01:17:17,573 --> 01:17:19,988
Find me one.

783
01:17:20,156 --> 01:17:21,973
You worm.

784
01:17:22,134 --> 01:17:23,788
Don't worry.

785
01:17:23,953 --> 01:17:27,738
With a little help from the right saint,
i'll find a young girl.

786
01:17:27,908 --> 01:17:30,072
I just have to be careful.

787
01:17:30,365 --> 01:17:33,487
They can ruin you.
Send you to jail.

788
01:17:35,310 --> 01:17:39,834
You know i work all day
at my stall in the market.

789
01:17:39,998 --> 01:17:41,815
You'll manage.

790
01:17:41,976 --> 01:17:43,727
Listen, carmine.

791
01:17:47,176 --> 01:17:51,864
I'll give you food
whenever you want.

792
01:17:52,025 --> 01:17:55,364
There's a bed for you here.
I won't kick you out.

793
01:17:56,300 --> 01:18:01,140
But don't even think i'll ever
walk the streets for you again.

794
01:18:01,308 --> 01:18:04,940
You did it for me, did you?
You did it because you liked it.

795
01:18:05,104 --> 01:18:06,659
Like i said:

796
01:18:07,049 --> 01:18:08,506
A bed and a plate of food.

797
01:18:08,677 --> 01:18:12,723
Hey, scumbag, remember this:

798
01:18:12,887 --> 01:18:15,660
You were covered with lice
when i found you. I cleaned you up.

799
01:18:15,822 --> 01:18:20,824
You didn't even own a dress.
I civilized you.

800
01:18:20,990 --> 01:18:25,516
I was 23 and you were 40.
You had your fill of this man.

801
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:28,899
You're the one who got me used
to money. I never asked you for it.

802
01:18:29,061 --> 01:18:32,791
You wanted me.
I had just arrived from my village.

803
01:18:33,526 --> 01:18:35,908
I didn't even know
women like you existed.

804
01:18:36,079 --> 01:18:39,417
You ruined me.
You turned me into a pimp.

805
01:18:39,587 --> 01:18:41,816
Admit it. Isn't it true?

806
01:18:42,362 --> 01:18:44,211
You dare deny it?

807
01:18:44,373 --> 01:18:45,351
Leave me alone.

808
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:49,948
Get out of my house!

809
01:18:50,114 --> 01:18:53,039
I know you don't want
to go back because of your son.

810
01:18:53,847 --> 01:18:57,131
You're afraid he'll find out.
Listen to me.

811
01:18:58,409 --> 01:19:02,075
If you don't go back,
i'll tell him everything.

812
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:04,141
Get out!

813
01:19:04,916 --> 01:19:07,015
I think i'll have that drink
with your son.

814
01:19:24,630 --> 01:19:27,110
Get up.
Stop acting like a crazy woman.

815
01:19:28,394 --> 01:19:32,092
You knew this would end
badly for one of us.

816
01:19:35,794 --> 01:19:40,602
Looking for a bit of heaven?
Don't you like our kind?

817
01:19:52,670 --> 01:19:55,084
Come here. Have a drink.

818
01:19:58,604 --> 01:20:01,246
Help yourself. Look.

819
01:20:04,186 --> 01:20:07,787
Here, drink up.
Don't be ashamed.

820
01:20:08,843 --> 01:20:11,867
It'll help.
You're not that young anymore.

821
01:20:12,033 --> 01:20:14,894
This fog rusts your bones.

822
01:20:16,659 --> 01:20:20,226
Screw them if they call us tramps.

823
01:20:32,257 --> 01:20:34,291
Why do you do this?

824
01:20:35,033 --> 01:20:39,046
Who makes you do it?
You don't even know yourself.

825
01:20:42,338 --> 01:20:44,948
You've done it for 30 years
and you're asking me?

826
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:47,593
It's your fault, you know.

827
01:20:48,399 --> 01:20:50,596
You're one to talk.

828
01:20:51,366 --> 01:20:55,314
How you end up is your own fault.

829
01:20:56,215 --> 01:20:57,868
Everybody knows that.

830
01:21:01,988 --> 01:21:05,142
The evil you do is like a highway

831
01:21:06,487 --> 01:21:09,608
the innocent have to walk down.

832
01:21:10,825 --> 01:21:17,231
When ettore was born,
he didn't want to walk down this road.

833
01:21:17,396 --> 01:21:20,647
But who put all this garbage
in your head?

834
01:21:24,861 --> 01:21:26,318
A priest.

835
01:21:28,114 --> 01:21:30,376
He was like a living bible.

836
01:21:33,442 --> 01:21:36,116
I didn't want
to start over from scratch.

837
01:21:37,174 --> 01:21:39,469
Maybe i just didn't understand.

838
01:21:40,938 --> 01:21:44,887
Damn you and this cognac!
Now you've got me drunk!

839
01:21:45,053 --> 01:21:48,969
Good-bye.
Do your soul searching by yourself.

840
01:21:50,093 --> 01:21:52,703
God, i've got an awful stomachache.

841
01:21:54,527 --> 01:21:58,226
Like i ate my own heart out.

842
01:22:02,438 --> 01:22:04,092
Hey, ventriloquist.

843
01:22:08,532 --> 01:22:11,370
- Are you one of my customers?
- No, i'm a soccer champion.

844
01:22:12,073 --> 01:22:14,618
Who can remember so many clients?

845
01:22:14,784 --> 01:22:16,502
I'm not the census bureau.

846
01:22:19,729 --> 01:22:23,014
The first was my husband,
ettore's father.

847
01:22:23,173 --> 01:22:24,663
You even had a husband?

848
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:27,320
A handsome young guy
with everything.

849
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:29,362
Sure, even a spare tire.

850
01:22:31,851 --> 01:22:34,363
Twenty people came to our wedding.

851
01:22:35,328 --> 01:22:37,709
We went to church one at a time.

852
01:22:37,879 --> 01:22:41,284
The first left at 9:00 a.m.,
the last at noon,

853
01:22:41,962 --> 01:22:45,812
at ten-minute intervals
so we wouldn't attract attention,

854
01:22:47,290 --> 01:22:50,183
because the police
were after my husband.

855
01:22:51,181 --> 01:22:54,041
When we were married,
as soon as i said "i do,"

856
01:22:54,212 --> 01:22:55,930
they took him away,

857
01:22:56,637 --> 01:22:59,888
and i was left a virgin at the altar.

858
01:23:00,050 --> 01:23:02,148
It could have been worse.

859
01:23:03,336 --> 01:23:05,913
You know why my husband,
ettore's father,

860
01:23:06,367 --> 01:23:08,433
was a first-rate son of a bitch?

861
01:23:08,598 --> 01:23:10,567
How should i know?

862
01:23:11,118 --> 01:23:14,273
Because his mother was
a bloodsucker, his father a thief.

863
01:23:14,437 --> 01:23:16,602
Why were they
a bloodsucker and a thief?

864
01:23:16,765 --> 01:23:21,834
Because his mother's father was a hit man,
and his mother's mother was a beggar.

865
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:25,760
His father's mother was a madam.
His father's father was a snitch.

866
01:23:25,921 --> 01:23:27,639
God deliver us from evil.

867
01:23:28,154 --> 01:23:31,275
And every one of them
starving to death.

868
01:23:33,002 --> 01:23:36,504
If they had had money,
they would have been fine people.

869
01:23:38,203 --> 01:23:40,464
So whose fault is that?

870
01:23:41,615 --> 01:23:43,681
Who's responsible?

871
01:23:43,849 --> 01:23:45,534
Closing up shop?

872
01:23:47,133 --> 01:23:49,581
No, for you i'll work overtime.

873
01:23:50,038 --> 01:23:51,179
Let's go, then.

874
01:23:51,728 --> 01:23:53,445
Whose fault is it?

875
01:23:53,674 --> 01:23:55,674
The birds' and the bees'.

876
01:23:57,087 --> 01:23:58,838
How much money have you got?

877
01:23:59,798 --> 01:24:02,822
Explain to me why i'm a nobody

878
01:24:03,467 --> 01:24:05,119
and you're the king of kings.

879
01:24:08,953 --> 01:24:10,889
Let's divide this cash.

880
01:24:12,813 --> 01:24:14,184
I'll count it again.

881
01:24:16,098 --> 01:24:19,471
One, two, three, four,

882
01:24:21,043 --> 01:24:25,186
five, six, seven, eight and nine.

883
01:24:26,052 --> 01:24:27,161
Where's the rest?

884
01:24:27,327 --> 01:24:30,187
Go and get change at the caf.

885
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:36,125
I'll take this for myself.

886
01:24:36,961 --> 01:24:38,810
What are you doing?

887
01:24:38,971 --> 01:24:40,722
Give me that back.

888
01:24:40,885 --> 01:24:43,050
I'm entitled to more than you.

889
01:24:43,214 --> 01:24:45,346
More than us?
What do you mean?

890
01:24:45,510 --> 01:24:47,707
We have to divide it equally.
Why should you get more?

891
01:24:47,871 --> 01:24:51,058
Because you didn't do anything.
I did it all.

892
01:24:56,580 --> 01:24:59,322
If you want it, come and get it.

893
01:25:01,460 --> 01:25:03,690
- Where are you going?
- Trying to be a smart guy?

894
01:25:11,700 --> 01:25:14,985
- Give it to me or we'll fight it out.
- Fine with me.

895
01:25:20,377 --> 01:25:23,335
What did you do
that we didn't do?

896
01:25:25,927 --> 01:25:27,679
I found the place.

897
01:25:27,938 --> 01:25:30,515
Who told you
the goods were there? I did.

898
01:25:30,681 --> 01:25:34,695
Who took you to gennarino,
the second-hand dealer? I did.

899
01:25:34,860 --> 01:25:37,818
He's my friend,
and that's why he bought the stuff.

900
01:25:42,739 --> 01:25:45,958
As soon as the hick gets here,
he starts acting big.

901
01:25:47,715 --> 01:25:49,944
Signora roma,
tell your son to calm down.

902
01:25:50,108 --> 01:25:51,761
He's not behaving.

903
01:25:53,266 --> 01:25:55,647
Ettore, where are you going?

904
01:25:58,752 --> 01:26:01,809
See what happens
when you don't work?

905
01:26:02,549 --> 01:26:04,996
Why did you leave that job?

906
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:07,109
Wandering around all day
like a lost soul.

907
01:26:07,269 --> 01:26:10,043
What do you do in the streets?

908
01:26:10,204 --> 01:26:13,044
At least you had your own money
when you were working.

909
01:26:14,128 --> 01:26:15,911
I bet you don't have a single lira.

910
01:26:19,616 --> 01:26:21,779
Here. Mamma will give you some.

911
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:27,647
I don't need your money.
I can earn my own.

912
01:26:29,345 --> 01:26:32,814
Whatever you do to your mother
will come back around to you.

913
01:26:33,683 --> 01:26:36,228
Aren't you ashamed
of what you're doing?

914
01:26:36,395 --> 01:26:38,940
Stupid loafer
without an ounce of brains.

915
01:26:39,457 --> 01:26:41,457
You don't have a shred of pride.

916
01:26:42,552 --> 01:26:44,368
Irresponsible fool!

917
01:26:54,387 --> 01:26:56,800
Hey, potato vendor, do me a favor.

918
01:26:57,353 --> 01:26:59,680
Take my stall back to the warehouse.

919
01:27:49,317 --> 01:27:51,797
Ettore, listen.

920
01:27:54,963 --> 01:27:56,933
You feeling all right?
You're all flushed.

921
01:27:57,994 --> 01:28:00,060
You've got a fever.

922
01:28:00,227 --> 01:28:01,152
It's over 102.

923
01:28:01,312 --> 01:28:02,834
Why aren't you in bed?

924
01:28:03,099 --> 01:28:04,501
Who gives a shit?

925
01:28:04,661 --> 01:28:08,393
You angry 'cause of what
i told you about your mother?

926
01:28:09,159 --> 01:28:12,314
Everybody knows.
I thought you knew, too.

927
01:28:12,477 --> 01:28:14,543
I've had enough!

928
01:28:14,709 --> 01:28:15,852
Leave me alone!

929
01:28:16,656 --> 01:28:19,265
I don't give a damn
about my mother!

930
01:29:00,486 --> 01:29:02,813
Get a move on.
You're not calling the shots here.

931
01:29:09,738 --> 01:29:12,989
Why did you stop at the hospital?
You want us to catch a fever, too?

932
01:29:28,654 --> 01:29:31,514
I'm going in.
You want to come?

933
01:29:31,684 --> 01:29:33,240
What for?

934
01:29:33,408 --> 01:29:35,256
To carry bedpans to dying patients?

935
01:29:46,166 --> 01:29:49,767
You're crazy if you go in there.
We can't keep doing that.

936
01:29:49,932 --> 01:29:52,737
We've pulled that trick five times.
They're gonna catch on.

937
01:29:52,898 --> 01:29:55,824
The orderlies aren't there
just to have a good time.

938
01:29:57,268 --> 01:30:01,314
Come if you want,
or i'll go by myself. I'm not afraid.

939
01:30:01,478 --> 01:30:04,698
Suit yourself.
Get caught if you want.

940
01:30:05,466 --> 01:30:08,207
I don't care.
The punishment's the same anyway.

941
01:30:13,697 --> 01:30:17,198
He's got a fever and it's late, anyway.
Why should we go?

942
01:30:21,735 --> 01:30:23,323
I spit on them!

943
01:30:29,487 --> 01:30:33,184
Let's go, tonino, you and me.
The fools.

944
01:30:37,877 --> 01:30:40,107
I'm coming. What the hell.

945
01:30:40,269 --> 01:30:42,781
Let's go.
Visiting hours are almost over.

946
01:30:45,980 --> 01:30:47,023
Nutcases!

947
01:30:56,218 --> 01:31:00,101
Watch out. Some of them
only pretend to be asleep.

948
01:31:00,844 --> 01:31:03,171
Nobody visits them
and they're ashamed.

949
01:31:03,332 --> 01:31:06,670
They keep their eyes closed, but they're
not really sleeping. You got that?

950
01:31:19,315 --> 01:31:23,556
Listen. I remember there's a guy
who has a little white radio

951
01:31:23,717 --> 01:31:26,577
at the end of the ward.
He's got one foot in the grave.

952
01:31:26,746 --> 01:31:28,715
The priest has already
been in to see him.

953
01:31:28,884 --> 01:31:31,016
He's got red hair and an ugly mug.

954
01:31:31,180 --> 01:31:34,400
They've already seen me around.

955
01:31:51,724 --> 01:31:52,670
There he is.

956
01:31:53,351 --> 01:31:54,242
The hick.

957
01:31:55,265 --> 01:31:57,625
He's so ugly he pisses me off.

958
01:32:00,975 --> 01:32:02,401
Go on.

959
01:32:27,229 --> 01:32:29,492
Put it back where it was.

960
01:32:30,163 --> 01:32:31,305
Shit!

961
01:32:34,247 --> 01:32:36,857
My radio! Nurse!

962
01:32:37,022 --> 01:32:38,446
He's a thief!

963
01:32:38,617 --> 01:32:41,923
This one, not him.
He's the one who stole my radio.

964
01:32:48,379 --> 01:32:50,793
Come along with me. Move.

965
01:33:09,689 --> 01:33:13,321
What did you learn today
from the divine comedy?

966
01:33:13,484 --> 01:33:16,888
Today i learned pages 104 to 105.

967
01:33:17,057 --> 01:33:19,286
It took a jail sentence
to educate you.

968
01:33:19,767 --> 01:33:21,900
Come on.
Let's hear that canto.

969
01:33:22,065 --> 01:33:26,622
I dreamed i was in the circle of shit,
and they kicked me out because i stank.

970
01:33:33,613 --> 01:33:36,223
We gonna hear
the divine comedy or not?

971
01:33:36,994 --> 01:33:39,321
Fourth canto.

972
01:33:40,119 --> 01:33:43,753
"Broke the deep slumber in my brain
a crash of heavy thunder,

973
01:33:43,916 --> 01:33:47,798
that i shook myself,
as one by main force roused.

974
01:33:48,797 --> 01:33:51,407
Risen upright,
my rested eyes i moved around,

975
01:33:51,573 --> 01:33:53,704
and searched with fixed ken,

976
01:33:53,869 --> 01:33:56,544
to know what place it was
wherein i stood."

977
01:33:57,569 --> 01:33:59,929
Hey, they put a crazy guy in with us.

978
01:34:00,090 --> 01:34:01,166
Calm down.

979
01:34:01,717 --> 01:34:05,633
A guy like you came in here a month ago,
and the next day he was dead.

980
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:08,693
Keep on reading.

981
01:34:08,862 --> 01:34:12,016
"On the brink i found me
of the lamentable vale,

982
01:34:12,180 --> 01:34:15,366
the dread abyss that joins a thunderous
sound of plaints innumerable.

983
01:34:15,528 --> 01:34:18,966
Dark and deep,
and thick with clouds o'erspread,

984
01:34:19,134 --> 01:34:21,582
mine eye in vain explored its bottom,

985
01:34:21,749 --> 01:34:24,458
nor could aught discern.

986
01:34:24,621 --> 01:34:27,198
Now let us to the blind world
there beneath descend."

987
01:34:27,779 --> 01:34:32,238
Play only for me, o gypsy violin

988
01:34:32,851 --> 01:34:35,809
perhaps you too dream of a love

989
01:34:37,285 --> 01:34:38,491
help!

990
01:34:43,314 --> 01:34:44,935
I want out of here!

991
01:34:47,173 --> 01:34:48,663
Let me out!

992
01:34:51,225 --> 01:34:53,291
Let me go!
You're hurting me!

993
01:35:00,157 --> 01:35:01,613
What's going on in there?

994
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:04,678
I'll have you put away!

995
01:35:05,643 --> 01:35:07,808
You've been carrying on like this
for three days now.

996
01:35:08,866 --> 01:35:10,681
I can't be responsible for him!

997
01:35:12,598 --> 01:35:14,566
I'm strapping him to the bed!

998
01:35:15,756 --> 01:35:17,094
Let's tie him down!

999
01:36:19,715 --> 01:36:22,739
Help me! My arms hurt!

1000
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:26,024
Why did you put me here?

1001
01:36:27,849 --> 01:36:28,774
Help!

1002
01:36:51,233 --> 01:36:53,016
Unstrap me. I'll stop.

1003
01:36:53,497 --> 01:36:55,498
I swear i'll stop.

1004
01:36:58,090 --> 01:36:59,808
I'll be good.

1005
01:37:02,014 --> 01:37:05,418
Take me back to guidonia,
where i lived when i was little.

1006
01:37:13,818 --> 01:37:15,721
I'm freezing to death.

1007
01:37:17,773 --> 01:37:19,110
I'm sick.

1008
01:37:24,918 --> 01:37:27,050
Tell them to unstrap me.

1009
01:37:38,445 --> 01:37:40,641
My poor baby.

1010
01:37:53,245 --> 01:37:55,247
My poor little boy.

1011
01:37:57,169 --> 01:37:59,496
He came into the world alone.

1012
01:38:01,061 --> 01:38:04,400
He grew up alone,
like a poor little sparrow,

1013
01:38:05,686 --> 01:38:07,275
looking all around,

1014
01:38:08,207 --> 01:38:10,055
searching for god knows what.

1015
01:38:12,226 --> 01:38:13,172
Alone.

1016
01:38:17,521 --> 01:38:19,272
Mamma, i'm dying.

1017
01:38:20,647 --> 01:38:22,910
I've been here all night.

1018
01:38:28,240 --> 01:38:30,023
I can't take it anymore.

1019
01:38:31,397 --> 01:38:33,529
Mamma, why are they
doing this to me?

1020
01:38:48,145 --> 01:38:49,962
Leave me alone.

1021
01:38:52,739 --> 01:38:57,166
Don't worry.
I spent time in jail as a kid, too.

1022
01:38:57,333 --> 01:38:59,333
You get over it.

1023
01:39:11,495 --> 01:39:15,062
When he gets out,
he'll have learned about life.

1024
01:39:15,227 --> 01:39:19,339
He'll turn over a new leaf.
Like water under the bridge.

1025
01:40:18,644 --> 01:40:19,885
Ettore!

1026
01:40:22,154 --> 01:40:23,970
Mamma roma, where are you going?

1027
01:40:31,598 --> 01:40:32,598
Mamma roma, where are you going?

1028
01:40:37,083 --> 01:40:39,824
- Mamma roma, wait.
- Stop.
