1
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,790
Michael ?

2
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,370
Look at me when I'm talking to you,
Michael.

3
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:44,070
What did I tell you
about touching the glass ?

4
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,711
Let's start from the beginning.
When's the last time you remember wearing them ?

5
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,400
I want you to try to remember.
That's not too much to ask, is it ?

6
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,990
- Charlie.
- What?

7
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,130
- I know you've been under a lot of pressure lately.
- How Lisa?

8
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,220
How could you possibly know
how much pressure I've been under lately ?

9
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,350
You have no idea,
not a clue.

10
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,880
Your book is brilliant.

11
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,360
Yes ?

12
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:18,500
What's so funny ? Do you know how expensive
they were ? Do you realize ?

13
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,290
How expensive those glasses were, do you
Mr. smarty pants ?

14
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:26,160
Stop calling him that.
Michael feels bad enough already.

15
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,470
Then why is he laughing ? Maybe he knows
something I don't know, he's so goddamn smart.

16
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,500
- Charlie.
- But if Mr. smarty pants

17
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,280
- Stop. Stop calling him that.
- Could remember where he put his glasses

18
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:38,850
- Charlie!
- Maybe it would be more slightly comfortable.

19
00:03:48,596 --> 00:03:51,290
Once the reviews are out,
you'll be granted tender.

20
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,100
- I earned that tender.
- I know you have.

21
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,660
They can go fuck themselves.

22
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,240
What did I tell you
about touching the glass ?

23
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,590
That's it.
What are you doing?

24
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:10,170
- You remember how to get home, don't you ?
- Don't be ridiculous.

25
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:14,390
We wouldn't be late,
picking up your sister from the airport

26
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:18,890
- if your son could remember where he put his glasses.
- Stop acting like a child.

27
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:23,200
You're calling me a child, me ?
Do you know what I do ?

28
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:28,497
- Have you even begin to conceive
the sacrifices I make for this family ? - You ?

29
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,730
Nobody forced you to quit this.
Take responsibility. It was your choice.

30
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:37,720
- One of us had to be an adult, raise our son.
- Find job you did in that.

31
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:43,120
If you'd stop babying him, he wouldn't be such a fuck up.
Have you ever think of that ?

32
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:44,880
Michael!

33
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:53,000
Mr. Taylor ? Sorry to bother you, do you mind ?

34
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,420
Yeah ... No.

35
00:05:56,335 --> 00:05:57,635
LOVE LETTERS

36
00:05:57,859 --> 00:05:59,783
FOR KELLY

37
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,560
Do you have a pen ?

38
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:08,110
Thank you Mr. Taylor, I'm such a big fan.
I've read all of your books.

39
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,264
Mr. Taylor is my father's name.
Call me Michael.

40
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,511
Thank you.

41
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,270
#baseball vocabulary#

42
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,900
Back off the plate then.

43
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,910
- It's not my fault you're such a shrimp.
- I'm not a shrimp.

44
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,950
- Mom says I have big feet for a girl my age.
- What's that suppose to mean ?

45
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:40,040
Leslie, Christopher, Aunt Lisa and Uncle
Charlie will be here any minute now to pick us up.

46
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,560
Okay, be there in a second.
Pitch it for real this time.

47
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,190
- Just put your seatblet on.
- It will wrinkle my dress.

48
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,930
I am proud of you, honey.

49
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,170
Is that so hard to believe?

50
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,300
Thank you, Charlie.

51
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,700
And you look beautiful.

52
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:29,310
I'm sure Michael's landed by now.
Ryne's probably just about there.

53
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,511
Sorry, it's such a big deal to take
3 cars instead of two ?

54
00:07:32,571 --> 00:07:36,512
- You're not sorry. Not at all.
- I mean, nobody drives this car but me.

55
00:07:36,768 --> 00:07:38,918
You've made that perfectly clear.

56
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,740
<i> The white zone is for loading and
unloading, passengers only. </ i></i>

57
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,800
<i> all unintended luggage will be confiscated</ i></i>

58
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,020

59
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,820
- *
- Yeah .. yes.

60
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:07,460
- Where is the rest of your luggage ?
- You're looking at it.

61
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,250
What ?

62
00:08:10,255 --> 00:08:13,044
- I thought you would be staying longer.
- How long are you staying ?

63
00:08:13,094 --> 00:08:16,500
I live here, remember ?
Yes, you live in a dorm. Look at you.

64
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:19,260
- Yes ?
- You've grown into a fine young man.

65
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,150
Shut up, asshole.

66
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,450
- How was the flight? - Incredible.
- Awesome.

67
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,140
How is New York?
- Cold.

68
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,690
- You guys still living in the same place ?
- Yes.

69
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:44,050
You think that it'd be okay to come out
and stay with you guys for a little bit ?

70
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,390
***

71
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,440
- Nice. - I don't want to impose.
Only if you have time.

72
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,950
- Of course we have time.
- Yeah ? -Yeah.

73
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,430
- Okay, cool.
- Cool.

74
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,670
Game over.
- Oh, come one, one last pitch, please !

75
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,180
Nice throw, Mom.

76
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:36,340
- Okay? - Fine.
- Lisa, do you have to do that now?

77
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:38,530
You rushed me out the door.

78
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,650
I don't want to be late.

79
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,380
Yes ! I did it.
In your face !

80
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,040
Leslie, Christopher, I said now !

81
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,360
Yes, I did it !

82
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,950
Charlie !

83
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,980
Mom ?

84
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,080
Mom !

85
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,150
- How's Kelly ?
- Fine.

86
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:20,560
Kelly ...

87
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,380
- I wish she was here.
- Yeah.

88
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:28,080
Stop at the omega.
I can't, we're gonna be late.

89
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,460
We'll get some pie, like old times.

90
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:33,070
I was six, that was no old times.

91
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,500
Shoot.

92
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,960
Hi, Aunt Jane.

93
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,890
Yes, yes. Michael's right here.

94
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:48,830
What's wrong ?

95
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,160
No ! No ...

96
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:32,440
No let me, I want to see it.

97
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,650
***

98
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,040
Are you okay ? Jesus.

99
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,210
- I didn't have a key.
- You should have gone to the porch.

100
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,680
Let get you inside, it'll get you warm.
Come on.

101
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,140
Why is she here?

102
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,860
Aunt Jane's spending the summer with us.

103
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,530
Why ?

104
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:21,811
Because she's my sister.

105
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,310
See how lucky I am
to have a son like you.

106
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,070
Well, I know.

107
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,180
I hate him.

108
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,250
Your father loves you very much.

109
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,810
He's a good man ...

110
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,230
- He's been under a lot of pressure lately.
- Why do you do that ?

111
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,030
- What?
- That.

112
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,130
What is it that I do ?

113
00:13:58,270 --> 00:13:59,970
Never mind.

114
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,150
Have you read his book?

115
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:14,000
- Yes.
- Is it any good?

116
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:18,570
I think now that it's finished,
things will be...

117
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,160
better.

118
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,730
I love you big.

119
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:47,890
I love you bigger.

120
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,550
Where did you get this from ?

121
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:06,060
I made it myself,
thank you very much.

122
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,720
Is there something wrong with the food ?

123
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,510
Meat is murder.

124
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:26,350
Sorry Jane, I've forgotten, Mom did tell me
you've become a vegetarian, what a healthy choice.

125
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:29,560
- Jesus, thanks.
- In this house we eat what's put on the table.

126
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:35,500
- What's your damage, Charlie?
- Excuse me what did you just say?

127
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,050
She said she doesn't eat meat, dad.

128
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:47,740
I see that you finally found your glasses.
Where were they?

129
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:54,290
- You don't know, where you found them ?
How's that possible. - The important thing is that he found them.

130
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,860
Since you're staying here this summer ...

131
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,440
- follow our rules.
- Like what, eat meat ?

132
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:07,010
Michael can explain them to you.
Or better...

133
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:08,840
he can make a list.

134
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,750
Write them up, tonight after dinner
You'll do that for us, right ?

135
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:18,520
You can look them over in the morning
before you go to the hospital.

136
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,750
Who's going to the hospital?
- Just ...

137
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,870
Tell me when you're done.

138
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,690
Hello ?

139
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,742
- Is anyone in there ?
- I heard you.

140
00:16:37,782 --> 00:16:41,357
Why didn't you answer me ?
Because, Charlie, did not ask a question.

141
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,710
Tell me when you're done.

142
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:09,730
If you were half as thorough with your schoolwork
as you were writing up these rules

143
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,690
maybe you'd get better grades.

144
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,960
Well, maybe I'd get better grades,
if I did not have to ...

145
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,070
to spend all my time
writing up those rules.

146
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:26,100
Give them to your aunt Jane.

147
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,520
Michael.

148
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,350
You have a beautiful penmanship.

149
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,580
Yes ?

150
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,080
Cousin Michael.

151
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:12,160
I'm not your cousin.
I am your aunt.

152
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,250
What ?

153
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,790
What do you want ?

154
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,950
Are you okay ?

155
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:31,240
Does he really expect me
to memorize all this ?

156
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,940
Yes.

157
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,950
This place totally sucks.

158
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,150
Where are the kids ?

159
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,030
They are with Uncle Jimmy.

160
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,670
Christopher ? Jane ?

161
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,460
Yes, Jane is fine.

162
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,270
I'm sorry.

163
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,730
I'm so sorry.

164
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:45,670
Daddy, Daddy, stop, please.

165
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,160
Where is Michael?

166
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:53,050
- He's out making the arrangements.
- Michael's making the arrangements ?

167
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,590
Don't !

168
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,630
- He's  ...
- Just don't.

169
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:03,350
Everything needs to be perfect.

170
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,570
- Perfect.
- It will be Daddy.

171
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,650
- Hello, Michael.
- Jimmy.

172
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:02,470
I'm so sorry, man.

173
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:06,660
I don't not know what I'd do
if I was Charlie.

174
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,820
How is he ?

175
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,980
Come on, let me get it for you.

176
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,060
Welcome home.

177
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,530
- Yes, I haven't read that yet, but I will.
- You're going somewhere ?

178
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:47,950
- A couple days in Cincinnati, I try to push
it off with this new job you know. - Right, right.

179
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,280
It looks good, Jimmy.
***

180
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,750
- Hey, sweet.
I got to tell you, my kids love it here.

181
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,610
Christophe's in your old room,
and Leslie's here in Ryne's.

182
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,380
Say hello to your cousin.

183
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,630
- Go on.
- You're short.

184
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:13,280
The guest room is upstairs. 2nd door on the right
But I guess you know that, cause it's your home.

185
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,870
Uncle Charlie says this is our home now.

186
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,910
You're right, honey.
It is our home now.

187
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:25,170
-But, Michael grew up here,
so this his is home too. - But is is our home.

188
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:31,430
Let's go catch some more of that ball game, right ?
If you need anything, let me know.

189
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,350
- This is great, to see you again.
- Yeah, you too Jimmy.

190
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,170
That's some good looking weather.

191
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,380
I like what you've done with the room.

192
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:23,230
I used to come here all the time
when I was grounded.

193
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:27,525
Mom told me you were always
getting her in trouble.

194
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,770
They talk.

195
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,040
What's that supposed to mean?

196
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,500
Before your mother was a mom,
she was my best friend.

197
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,830
You guys had tea parties together ?

198
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,800
Occasionally.

199
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:47,650
Your mother taught me anything I shouldn't know.
Smart ass.

200
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,780
How to write like a chick.

201
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:54,770
Funny.
Glad to see your balls finally dropped.

202
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:59,100
No, your mother taught me
the art of fishing.

203
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,590
Fishing ?

204
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:07,590
Fishing is boring.
Not the way we use to do it, it wasn't.

205
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,360
Yeah, right.

206
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,580
Want me to show you ?

207
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,250


208
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,450


209
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:26,360
- That story's gonna stop ?
- You're right, it is gonna stop, just not tonight.

210
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:31,530
- Have we got any cheese, Dad ?
- What for ?

211
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:54,800
- Butterfly net ?
- Yes.

212
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,670
- Cheese ?
- Yep.

213
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:01,400
Buckle up.

214
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,210
- What's in the box ?
- Patience, Christopher.

215
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:07,110
Patience.

216
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,020
- Now ?
- Patience.

217
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:44,740
- I'll just go to my dorm.
- No, you won't.

218
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:48,950
- Well, Aunty Jane.
- Don't call me Aunty Jane.

219
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:51,010
You're not a little girl anymore.

220
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,360
And I'm not that old.

221
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,490
You look so much like your mother.

222
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,760
Perfect.
Both of you.

223
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,020
Come, it's okay, let's go.

224
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:25,490
These things are totally ancient.
They're never gonna work.

225
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,340
Can I see ? Can I see ? Cool !

226
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:31,520
Get out of here, lesbo.

227
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:35,190
I'm not a lesbo.
What's a lesbo ?

228
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:37,730
- A girl and girl.
- Get out of here !

229
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:41,660
- What the hell is wrong with you ?
- She's always screwing stuff up.

230
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,430
- Look who's talking. - Screw you !
- I'm telling Mom he swore.

231
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,250
Come here. You too.

232
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:55,360
Nobody's telling Mom anything.
Not me, not you, nobody. Got it ?

233
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:01,865
Well. You okay ?
Let me look at you.

234
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:05,760
- So, we're not gonna tell Mom ?
- No, Jesus Christ, no.

235
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:14,910
What's wrong ?

236
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,770
You hear that ?

237
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,560
What ?

238
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:22,310
Leslie, Christopher ?

239
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,750
Leslie, Christopher ?

240
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,360
Honey ... Honey ?

241
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,360
Where are the kids ?

242
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:43,370
- With Michael.
- Where did they go?

243
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:48,310
Christopher said he wanted some cheese.
And a butterfly net.

244
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:53,370
You know how to do it?

245
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,660
Throw it. Away, away, away.

246
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:57,750


247
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,320
- Nice pitch.
- I told you they wouldn't work.

248
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:07,060
Can I try ?
No, you're strictly a spectator. Back. Back.

249
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,780
Come on guys, back, all the way.

250
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:27,180
Damn.

251
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:31,070
Wow ! I wanna try, can I try please ?

252
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:34,090
We need to do that again !

253
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,930
How did you get hurt ?

254
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,040
You know, Christopher?

255
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,240
You took them fishing, didn't you ?

256
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,840
Fishing with firecrackers.

257
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:08,410
That blond didn't throw a single fish,
not one.

258
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,700
Michael said you can skip a fish
all the way across the ...

259
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:17,190
You took them to a large body of water
during a lightning storm.

260
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,500
Let's not rush to judgment just yet.

261
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:21,875
We got home well before the storm.

262
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:27,070
We did, didn't we ?
- Get upstairs, wash out, you stink.

263
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,800
Washing them the all time,
I had proper adult supervision.

264
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:37,900
Do you know who still got their kicks
blowing out fish ?

265
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,800
You use to.

266
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:41,900
Get upstairs immediately.

267
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:48,650
You're right. We did do a lot of dumb things
back when we were kids.

268
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:52,400
- But that is not the point.
- What is the point, Jane ?

269
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:57,480
My children lied to me,
because you told them to.

270
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,650
Sorry.

271
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,800
I messed up.

272
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:11,590
I promise you that I will never ever
take them fishing with firecrackers again.

273
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:16,850
Further more, they will never ever
lie to their mother again.

274
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:20,210
Probably because they are the worst liars.

275
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:25,340
What are you doing ?
Promising, like we were doing when we were kids.

276
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,340
Come on.

277
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,580
- You suck, you know that ?
- I really do.

278
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,490
But you love me.

279
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,040
Shit!

280
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,690
The thing that is written will come true.

281
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,760
Death has been swallowed up in victory.

282
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,390
Where death is your victory.

283
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:08,560
Where death is your sting.

284
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,620
The sting of death is sin.

285
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,840
And the power of sin is the Law.

286
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:16,290
But thanks be to god,
that gives us the victory

287
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,710
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

288
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:21,420
We bow our heads and pray.

289
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,040
God of peace.

290
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,880
You brought again from the dead,
our Lord Jesus Christ.

291
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,000
The Great Shepherd of the sheep.

292
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:31,420
Through the blood of the everlasting covenant ...

293
00:33:32,050 --> 00:33:36,190
Where's your jacket?
Christopher's wearing it.

294
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:38,950
Why's Christopher wearing your jacket ?

295
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,060
Because I gave it to him.

296
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:45,200
- Amen
- Amen.

297
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:48,100
- Christ is risen.
- He's risen indeed.

298
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,760
Just go forth in peace,
in the name of our risen Lord.

299
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,550
Stupid.

300
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:55,720
Stupid, stupid.

301
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,100
Stupid. Stupid.

302
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:05,530
Why ? Fucking stupid.
Why ?

303
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:11,940
Congratulations on your retirement.
Thank you, thank you

304
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,710
I am sure that I
leave university in good hands.

305
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:18,920
- It's gonna be ok.
- ok.

306
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,810
Your father told me
that you were graduating next month.

307
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,000
I am proud of my girl.

308
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,170
- Is this seat taken ?
- It's all yours.

309
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,260
Addison Wesley.

310
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,230
After reading his memoir,
masqueraded as a novel ...

311
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:01,980
I wanted to jump in the shower
and scrub the slime away with the brillo pad.

312
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:08,790
Did you ?
Manage to scrub the slime away ?

313
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,450
You always memorize
all of your reviews ?

314
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:14,040
No, only the good.

315
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:19,410
Michael Taylor.
Always nice to meet a fan.

316
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:29,230
- Your mother was a wonderful person.
- Yes, she was.

317
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:37,330
How did you know her ? - Your father and I
teach in the English department together and...

318
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,760
She was my best student.

319
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,620
- Yeah ?
- Yeah.

320
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,160
Kelly.

321
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,230
I'm so sorry.

322
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:51,740
- Would you excuse me?
- Of course.

323
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,520
- Jane, hi. How are you?
- Kelly.

324
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:09,070
- I'm glad you could make it.
- Thank you.

325
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,150
Come on, come here.

326
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,860
You need anything right now ?

327
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,010
It's good to see you.
Yes, I'm glad you're here.

328
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,390


329
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,120
Mind if I join you ?

330
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:08,080
How did Jane call ?
How do you know it was Jane ?

331
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,080
She's the only one I told.

332
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:19,570
It is not what you think. Show up here ...
It's just easier.

333
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,540
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah ?

334
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,340
What are you sorry for ?

335
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,590
I've been sober for two months and fifteen days.

336
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,648
- I am proud of you. - Thank you.
- Your welcome.

337
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,354
It sucks that it broke up our marriage
but hey, you're sober now, that's all that really matters.

338
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:44,300
Stop it. Stop it.

339
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:47,660
- This was a mistake coming here.
I shouldn't be here. - Wait.

340
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,190
You did not answer my question.

341
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,220
What are you sorry for ?

342
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,400
Fuck it, I ...

343
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:02,970
I just wanted to help.
Help you.

344
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,090
I know.

345
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,690
Are you happy ?

346
00:38:13,870 --> 00:38:15,590
Yes, I'm happy.

347
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,180
Good.

348
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:22,070
I am happy for you.

349
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,180
I am.

350
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:02,640
Michael, time up, time up.
Everybody's downstairs.

351
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,760
Fuck it.

352
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:21,280
My father used to say,
that if you don't take care of something ...

353
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:24,270
You don't deserve to have it.

354
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,720
Lisa was so good,
so beautiful ...

355
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,980
She gave herself to me ...

356
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,760
and she loved me.

357
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,020
Sometimes I wonder why ...

358
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,910
but she did.

359
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,250
Lisa was perfect.

360
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:58,240
- Where is your brother?
- I don't know.

361
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,050
Lisa was graduating ...

362
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:30,580
So we're here not only in remembrance,
but also to celebrate her accomplishments.

363
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:38,200
I know this gathering
would have made Lisa very grateful and happy,

364
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:48,910
so in her honor,

365
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:53,200
let's share a moment of silence.

366
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:08,530
I am sorry Daddy.
Excuse me.

367
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:39,670
Michael, I heard you took the kids fishing,
the night before your mom's funeral.

368
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,490
- Yes, we had tons of ...
- And then we threw them all back.

369
00:41:43,931 --> 00:41:45,421
Yes, and then we threw them all back.

370
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,440
- He took you out fishing ...
- What's the big deal ?

371
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:50,970
- The big deal ...
- It's okay.

372
00:41:51,845 --> 00:41:53,218
Let sit.

373
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:58,240
It does not feel right. At a certain
way shows no respect.

374
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:01,290
In what's fishing disrespectful ?
It's not about fishing,

375
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,330
but when you go fishing,

376
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,400
it's about being properly dressed
for your mother's funeral,

377
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:10,980
it's about demonstrating some self-control
and consideration for others, you understand ?

378
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:13,870
- No.
- You don't understand ?

379
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
Not really.
- I'm confused ...

380
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,760
You don't understand or you do understand ?
Which is it ?

381
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:21,000
We understand, Charles.
Don't we, Michael?

382
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:24,980
I understand that Mom wouldn't have care
over something as silly as fishing.

383
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:27,290
Your behavior is embarrassing.

384
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:31,210
- For who ? You ?
- For this family!

385
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:34,070
Well...

386
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:40,210
I'm sorry, Jane.
Sorry isn't gonna get the stain out, is it ?

387
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,050
After all that happened,
don't you think you two could just ...

388
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:50,220
stop.

389
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:52,430
I'm sorry.

390
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:55,790
It's ruined.

391
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:14,240
Maybe you and Ryan could box
some of your mother's stuff for good will.

392
00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:17,300
I know it's what she would have wanted.

393
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,150
Will you do that ?

394
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:27,260
Yeah.

395
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:33,540
- Okay, all right.
- Thanks Jimmy.

396
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:35,880
I'll get the car.

397
00:43:44,310 --> 00:43:47,920
Leslie ...
Say good night to your Uncle Charlie.

398
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:53,800
Have I scared you at dinner ?

399
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,510
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

400
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:58,950
Sometimes your Uncle Charlie
acts a bit stupid.

401
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:01,790
That's OK.

402
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,510
Thanks Jane.
Dinner was good.

403
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:08,360
I'm sorry.

404
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,200
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, honey.

405
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:17,130
- Ready Charlie ?
- Yeah.

406
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:20,950
Good night, Christopher.
I'll be right there. Okay.

407
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,470
I so wish you didn't have to go.
Me too, me too.

408
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:27,980
- Don't go.
- You're gonna be ok.

409
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:30,370
You are.

410
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:34,380
- I love you.
- I love you too.

411
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:41,540
- Call me as soon as you land.
- You know I will.

412
00:44:41,575 --> 00:44:43,710
Go on, get outta here.

413
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:05,910
Thank you.

414
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,580
For calling Kelly.

415
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:12,230
- Why did you do it ?
- Because I knew you wouldn't.

416
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,570
If she makes you happy,
that's what's important.

417
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,910
You know, I think I read that somewhere.

418
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:31,030
How is Christopher doing ?

419
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:35,080
Doesn't sleep, keeps running on fumes.

420
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:38,740
You look like you could use
a little rest yourself.

421
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:42,150
I'd love to Michael, but with Jimmie gone,
it's not really an option.

422
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:46,450
Yes, yes ...
Jimmie's got a lot huh ?

423
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:51,350
- Jimmy has never once said a word about you.
- What ? What did I say ?

424
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:55,850
- Oh, shut up. - Let's go fishing.
- This is not funny. - Come on.

425
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:57,330
No.

426
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,350
- I got it.
- No, I'm gonna wash and you dry. Here.

427
00:46:05,394 --> 00:46:06,794
Thanks.

428
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:11,740
- Think you can manage ?
- Yeah, I think I can manage.

429
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:13,930
It's fine.

430
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,650
This was always your mother's job.

431
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,060
She wore gloves to protect her hands.

432
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,180
She had the most beautiful hands.

433
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:26,620
"You don't want dishman hands" she warned me.

434
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:29,500
"You should always wear gloves,
always. "

435
00:46:31,810 --> 00:46:33,810
But they never did fit me quite right.

436
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:36,800
Always a little too tight.

437
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:55,140
Did you read my book?

438
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,480
I don't need to, Michael.

439
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,050
- Why not?
- Because I lived it.

440
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:08,390
- It is fiction, Jane.
- No one is gonna read that book and not think it's about ...

441
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:13,471
- This book is gonna kill your dad.
- Am I suppose to spend the rest of my life writing romance novels ?

442
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,860
What's that all about ?
Proving yourself ?

443
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:19,460
No, this is not about proving myself at all.

444
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:24,520
Because of that book, everyone is going to know.

445
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:28,330
Why ?
The kids ... Jimmy ...

446
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,380
Everyone's gonna know.

447
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,310
What ?

448
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:39,050
Jane, what's everyone gonna know ?

449
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,800
Oh my God, oh God.

450
00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:53,680
I'm sorry.

451
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:57,050
How can you be sorry,
when you have no idea ...

452
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,300
what your apologizing for.

453
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:04,970
Come on cousin Michael. Let's go.
Let's go. Come on.

454
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:07,200
- Okay, okay.
- Come on.

455
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,590
Fireflies in the garden,

456
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:55,750
by Michael Taylor.

457
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,800
<i>Here come real stars
to fill the upper skies, </ i></i>

458
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:03,200
<i>and here on earth,
come emulating flies</ i></i>

459
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:07,070
<i>That, though they never equal stars in size </ i></i>

460
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,650
(and they were never really stars at heart),

461
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,870
<i> Achieve at time a very starlike start </ i></i>

462
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:17,210
<i>Only, of course, they can't sustain the part. </ i></i>

463
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,310
If you don't know how to take care
care of something ...

464
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:43,410
you don't deserve to have it.

465
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,430
In the car.
Get in the car, now!

466
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:06,200
Am I a bad father ?

467
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,360
- No.
- I couldn't here you, what did you say?

468
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,600
I said no.

469
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:24,480
Go ahead, pick them up.

470
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,480
Michael.
Look at me, Michael.

471
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:45,760
Why did you do that ?
Why ?

472
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:49,000
Did you think you were gonna get away
with it ?

473
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:51,600
Or is it because you don't respect yourself ?

474
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:57,140
I told my colleagues in the English Department,
the English Department ...

475
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:01,890
that my son was going to recite
from an original poem.

476
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,004
- That means a poem written by you.
- I know.

477
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:07,310
Then, Mr. smarty pants,
Tell me...

478
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:10,430
exactly when did you become a buddhist ?

479
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:13,280
I am not.

480
00:51:15,090 --> 00:51:20,300
You must be if you claim to be
the reincarnation of the late Robert Frost.

481
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:23,700
Otherwise why would you be
so stupid to say

482
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:25,990
that you had written one of his poems.

483
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:28,810
Why ?

484
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:46,990
More tea ?

485
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,680
Excuse me please.

486
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:10,330
Charlie.

487
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:12,640
Charlie, open the door.

488
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:17,090
Charlie, open the goddamn door.

489
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,710
Charlie !

490
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,540
Do you understand me ?

491
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:39,480
Yes.

492
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:42,950
Charlie, Open the door!

493
00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:46,850
That's enough.

494
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:50,520
Charlie !

495
00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:52,990
Will you open this door ?!

496
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:07,220
Sweetheart, are you okay ?
What happened ?

497
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:09,310
What happened sweetheart ?

498
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:12,950
It's okay, it's okay.
Mom is here.

499
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,500
It's okay, sweety.

500
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:26,110
Michael ?

501
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,390
Honey.

502
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:39,490
I brought you some dinner.

503
00:53:41,050 --> 00:53:42,900
I'm not hungry.

504
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,640
Just try to eat something.

505
00:53:52,990 --> 00:53:54,940
Are you okay mom ?

506
00:53:57,670 --> 00:53:59,960
That baby brother sure can kick.

507
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:02,190
Can you feel that ?

508
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:06,360
How does it feel like ?

509
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:09,490
Let's see if he does it again.

510
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:11,850
Give me your hand.

511
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:18,840
- Did you feel that ?
- No.

512
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:22,770
Press right there.

513
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,780
That was weird.

514
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,250
That's him.

515
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:35,190
How do you know it's not a girl?

516
00:54:36,030 --> 00:54:37,930
Just a feeling, I guess.

517
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:44,170
What about names ?
What do you think we should name him ?

518
00:54:48,563 --> 00:54:51,722
I don't know.
What names dad want ?

519
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:53,970
We haven't talked about it actually.

520
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:57,530
I was thinking... Max.

521
00:54:58,450 --> 00:55:00,700
Max is a strong name,
what do you think?

522
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:03,220
Max, like Maxi pad ?

523
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:09,160
Do you have any ideas ?

524
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,860
Ryne.

525
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:18,890
- Ryan ...
- No, not Ryan.

526
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:22,260
Ryne, like a ryony.

527
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,650
How did you think
of a name like that ?

528
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,960
I like it.
Ryne Taylor.

529
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:38,280
Sounds good. - Yeah ?
Yeah.

530
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:46,440


531
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:48,910
Eat your dinner
whenever you're ready, okay ?.

532
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,100
I love you honey.

533
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:00,680
I love you big.

534
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:39,540
You're okay ?

535
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:52,090
Aren't you gonna eat ?

536
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:55,600
Go away, Jane.

537
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:09,090
Take a bite.

538
00:57:11,370 --> 00:57:14,120
Take just one bite
and then I'll leave you alone.

539
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:23,190
What happened in the garage,
Michael ?

540
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:28,350
What did Charlie do to you ?

541
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:33,980
Michael ?

542
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:38,010
I'm not leaving until you take a bite.

543
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:40,270
- Just take one more bite...
- I can't, okay?

544
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:44,200
I can't take a bite.
I can't move my arms.

545
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:48,650
- Why can't you ?
- Because it hurts too much.

546
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:55,850
I can't.

547
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,550
- What are you doing?
- Eat.

548
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:11,550
Eat.

549
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:20,990
You wanna go fishing sometimes ?

550
00:58:22,430 --> 00:58:24,410
I thought you were a vegetarian.

551
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:44,780
We're going to Jane's house,
to pick up the rest of the family, so we can all go to...

552
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:47,140
Lisa's graduation together.

553
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:50,500
As always ...

554
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:54,190
we were late.
Lisa was ...

555
00:58:54,790 --> 00:58:57,110
putting on make up in the car ...

556
00:58:57,490 --> 00:58:59,690
I told her to wear a seatbelt.

557
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:06,350
We ...
started arguing ...

558
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:11,950
I got angry ...
I was driving fast, too fast.

559
00:59:15,070 --> 00:59:19,320
As we got near the house,
Christopher ran out, I swerved ...

560
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,840
We hit the pole.

561
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:27,460
It's my fault.

562
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,620
It's my fault Lisa's dead.

563
00:59:34,350 --> 00:59:35,950
Daddy ?

564
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,550
Yeah, honey.

565
00:59:43,630 --> 00:59:45,880
- Everything okay ?
- Fine.

566
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:48,710
Everything's fine.
I'm gonna take a nap.

567
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:17,070
This is a keeper.

568
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:21,730
This is more than a simple sale, Kelly.

569
01:00:25,610 --> 01:00:27,750
Good will said that they'd be here on Monday and ...

570
01:00:27,810 --> 01:00:31,060
since the 2 of you are leaving tomorrow,
it doesn't leave us much time.

571
01:00:35,530 --> 01:00:37,320
- What are you doing?
- I'm just checking.

572
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,400
I already pull out the pockets on everything,
like you told me to.

573
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:43,060
- I know you did.
- What are you doing ? -  What does it look like Micheal ?

574
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:46,290
What's wrong with you?

575
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:48,740
Dad made the money,
Mom paid the bills.

576
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:53,130
She had to hide everything,
because he would have blown all the cash and then we'd be broke.

577
01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:57,270
The problem is, we do not know
where she hid anything.

578
01:01:00,310 --> 01:01:02,010
You get it Michael ?

579
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:04,910
You get it now why I'm being so fucking anal ?

580
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,240
Calm down, Ryne.

581
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:12,890
It's just ...

582
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,400
I just never thought that ...

583
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:18,910
That we'd be ...

584
01:01:23,565 --> 01:01:25,265
Fuck.

585
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:29,500
It really fucking sucks.

586
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:34,837
What am I suppose to do
with all mom's shit ?

587
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:43,240
I'm gonna start with mom's closet.

588
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:47,060
This is a great idea, just ...

589
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:50,150
Be quiet about it, please.

590
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:56,180


591
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,000


592
01:03:06,310 --> 01:03:08,310


593
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:10,590


594
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:20,300


595
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,540
Your mother kept everything.

596
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:33,420
Better safe than sorry.

597
01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:37,650
Found anything interesting?

598
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,540
Not really.

599
01:03:47,230 --> 01:03:49,730
Jane told me
that you just finished you're new book.

600
01:03:50,590 --> 01:03:52,590
I did, yeah.

601
01:03:56,430 --> 01:03:58,330
I heard this one's different.

602
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,500
You can say that.

603
01:04:02,320 --> 01:04:04,150
When does it come out ?

604
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:07,220
Soon.

605
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:12,920
It's good.

606
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:20,050
What's it about ?

607
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:29,150
- You did write it, did you ?
- Yes, I did.

608
01:04:34,930 --> 01:04:36,140
Just read it, okay?

609
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:41,090
Whatever you want.

610
01:04:45,070 --> 01:04:47,110
- Hey, Dad ...
- Yes, Michael.

611
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:53,210
What happened to us ?

612
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:56,040
What do you mean?

613
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:07,370
It hasn't always been like this.

614
01:05:09,170 --> 01:05:10,910
The way it is now, between us.

615
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:13,850
Has it ?

616
01:05:21,770 --> 01:05:23,650
I can't remember, Michael.

617
01:05:49,940 --> 01:05:51,340
Hello ?

618
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,500
Michael.

619
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,830
Everything looks different.

620
01:06:19,890 --> 01:06:22,900
Yes.
There's been a lot of building.

621
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:25,520
New student center, new residence halls.

622
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:28,750
It used to be my dorm room over there,
it doesn't exist anymore.

623
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:33,650
We need to talk, Addison.

624
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:37,690
- What about?
- About why you were fucking my mom.

625
01:06:38,890 --> 01:06:40,190
Sit.

626
01:06:42,900 --> 01:06:44,540
Come on, sit.

627
01:06:59,570 --> 01:07:03,020
Where do you wanna talk about ?

628
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:05,050
Do you like pie ?

629
01:07:06,350 --> 01:07:08,320
Do you like pie ?

630
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:12,320
- Yes.
- Me too.

631
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:14,670
It's good.

632
01:07:19,030 --> 01:07:22,280
Where did you take her ?
Your place, her place ?

633
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:24,240
A hotel.

634
01:07:25,110 --> 01:07:27,110
Just trying to make sense of this arrangement.

635
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:30,210
How can you look my father in the eye,
every day ?

636
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:34,230
Was she happy ?

637
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:38,480
- Was my mother happy ? With you ?
- Yes.

638
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,470
- Did you love her?
- Very much so.

639
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:51,170
- How long were you two together? - Michael ...
- How long ? How long ...

640
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:54,610
were you two together, Addison ...
- Two, maybe three years.

641
01:07:58,250 --> 01:07:59,690
Three years.

642
01:08:07,590 --> 01:08:09,940
What do you remember most
about my mother?

643
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,100
Her eyes.

644
01:08:22,130 --> 01:08:23,960
When she smiles she ...

645
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,640
she had the happiest eyes ...

646
01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:43,360
Open it.

647
01:08:54,790 --> 01:08:57,200
She wanted him to leave,
after she graduated.

648
01:08:57,670 --> 01:09:01,660
I would not know why, leaving
with him is like Christmas every day ...

649
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:03,690
but she was gonna leave him.

650
01:09:04,460 --> 01:09:05,960
For you.

651
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:12,450
- Michael, I'm so sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

652
01:09:13,030 --> 01:09:14,400
Don't.

653
01:09:19,210 --> 01:09:21,760
You made here happy,
that's all that matters.

654
01:09:24,310 --> 01:09:25,710
Thanks.

655
01:09:37,490 --> 01:09:39,590
- Daddy !
- Hey, sweet.

656
01:09:42,150 --> 01:09:45,060
I missed you.
And I have something for you.

657
01:09:45,849 --> 01:09:47,949
- You like that ?
- Thanks.

658
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:03,560
There's no reason to be nervous.
I'm just gonna ask you a couple of questions and that's it.

659
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:06,250
What about your aunt's funeral ?

660
01:10:06,590 --> 01:10:08,430
Can we talk about that ?

661
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:13,110
- Did you go to your aunt's funeral ?
- Yes, I was there.

662
01:10:13,530 --> 01:10:18,350
- We know you were there. - Then what's she doing here ?
- I'm just here to help you Christopher. - Leave me alone!

663
01:10:18,410 --> 01:10:20,660
I don't need your help.
- Christopher ...

664
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:42,690
These are so cool.

665
01:10:42,850 --> 01:10:44,500
You've got Sweetness ...

666
01:10:47,430 --> 01:10:48,930
Ernie ...

667
01:10:49,150 --> 01:10:51,080
McMahon, Fisk ...

668
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:52,940
Santo ...

669
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,940
Fergie ...

670
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:02,360
Oh God, you've got a Ryne
Sandberg rookie card, he's totally my favorite.

671
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:04,580
Seriously ?

672
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:07,380
- Me too.
- He's so hot.

673
01:11:12,150 --> 01:11:13,900
You want 'em?

674
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:17,520
Really ?

675
01:11:17,780 --> 01:11:20,330
He's yours.

676
01:11:21,620 --> 01:11:23,650
- Don't you dare turning this around on me.
- Lisa ...

677
01:11:23,710 --> 01:11:27,407
- it's not what you think.
- Why don't you tell me, Charlie ...

678
01:11:27,467 --> 01:11:29,500
What am I thinking ? Tell me !

679
01:11:33,090 --> 01:11:37,030
- Listen to me.
- All I've ever done is listen to you, Charlie.

680
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:39,640
Listen and apologize
on the half of all my ...

681
01:11:39,770 --> 01:11:43,940
fellow idiots in the world,
who couldn't give too shit in what you have to say.

682
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,490
I'm sorry you didn't get tender.

683
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:49,140
I'm sorry no one is buying your book.

684
01:11:49,850 --> 01:11:52,840
I'm sorry being a husband
and a father isn't enough for you.

685
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:55,330
I never said that, never... never.

686
01:11:56,180 --> 01:11:57,920
You sleep with her ?

687
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:02,210
Did you sleep with her ?

688
01:12:03,710 --> 01:12:06,920
Did she tell you everything
you so badly need to here  ?

689
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:11,110
How witty you are, how charmingly handsome ...

690
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:14,870
"Oh, Professor Taylor, you're such a genius ..."
She giggles at your stupid fucking jokes ...

691
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:18,740
- Is that it ? - Yes. And then I took her to my office
and then I fucked here.

692
01:12:18,850 --> 01:12:20,600
Is that what you want to hear?

693
01:12:22,860 --> 01:12:26,100
- Michael ? Michael, Jane, we're leaving.
- Lisa

694
01:12:26,170 --> 01:12:28,170
I'm sorry, nothing happened.

695
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:30,690
- Lisa.
- Get away from my car.

696
01:12:31,690 --> 01:12:34,630
- Your car ?
- Who paid for your car? You?

697
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:36,690
You don't even have a fucking job.

698
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:40,110
- So look at me when I'm talking to you.
- Get away from her.

699
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:43,850
Get back in the house.
Get away from her, or I'll kill you.

700
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:46,890
I swear I'll do it,
damn it, I swear.

701
01:12:47,620 --> 01:12:51,020
Are you threatening me?
I am your father.

702
01:12:51,150 --> 01:12:53,490
Put that down, and come here.
Come here right now !

703
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:56,831
I swear to god,
I swear to god, I'll kill you.

704
01:13:02,057 --> 01:13:04,829
Who are you?
The knight in shining armor ?

705
01:13:05,505 --> 01:13:07,503
Mommy's little protector?

706
01:13:11,883 --> 01:13:13,741
You ain't gonna do anything.

707
01:13:18,775 --> 01:13:20,058
Michael !

708
01:13:20,999 --> 01:13:22,809
Michael, don't !

709
01:13:25,437 --> 01:13:27,312
Michael, Michae l!

710
01:13:28,535 --> 01:13:31,383
I hate you.
You hear me ? I hate you !

711
01:13:31,601 --> 01:13:33,370
I wish you were dead.

712
01:13:34,558 --> 01:13:35,867
Michael !

713
01:13:57,450 --> 01:13:58,850
Christopher !

714
01:14:00,882 --> 01:14:02,282
Christopher !

715
01:14:06,992 --> 01:14:09,500
- Stop !
- What do you want ? - Nothing.

716
01:14:09,559 --> 01:14:12,888
Leave me alone.
- Just... talk to me.

717
01:14:12,930 --> 01:14:16,591
What for ?
Just to go tell how fucked up I am ?

718
01:14:17,003 --> 01:14:21,490
You don't need to tell me it's all fucking fine.
Aunt Lisa is dead.

719
01:14:23,102 --> 01:14:24,428
It's not your fault.

720
01:14:24,646 --> 01:14:26,731
- Get out of the way.
- You did not have time ...

721
01:14:26,817 --> 01:14:30,706
I had time.
I had time enough to think "Move your feet !"

722
01:14:30,888 --> 01:14:32,888
Move your fucking feet.

723
01:14:33,899 --> 01:14:36,362
No matter how loud I yelled in my head.

724
01:14:36,933 --> 01:14:38,683
I just couldn't move.

725
01:14:39,074 --> 01:14:41,402
I tried to run, but ...

726
01:14:42,596 --> 01:14:44,996
I did not even go
to Aunt Lisa's funeral.

727
01:14:45,449 --> 01:14:47,049
You were there.

728
01:14:48,304 --> 01:14:51,097
- No.
- Yes, you were - I was in the car.
- I saw you Christopher.

729
01:14:51,192 --> 01:14:55,641
I saw you. Look at me.
Come on look at me, please.

730
01:14:55,718 --> 01:14:59,612
I want you to think, okay?
Think about this ...

731
01:14:59,707 --> 01:15:01,904
If your mom didn't let you throw
that last pitch ...

732
01:15:02,228 --> 01:15:04,228
If your sister didn't hit
that last home run ...

733
01:15:04,904 --> 01:15:07,065
If my dad wasn't driving too fast ...

734
01:15:07,882 --> 01:15:11,869
If my mother was wearing a seatbelt,
she might be alive.

735
01:15:13,251 --> 01:15:17,837
Maybe. But that's a whole lot of things
that has nothing to do with you.

736
01:15:18,892 --> 01:15:20,392
Understand ?

737
01:15:22,059 --> 01:15:23,809
It's not your fault.

738
01:15:25,548 --> 01:15:27,298
It's not your fault.

739
01:15:32,456 --> 01:15:34,456
- Okay ?
- Yeah.

740
01:15:36,985 --> 01:15:39,109
Let's go home, okay ?

741
01:15:40,526 --> 01:15:42,884
No, I'll get a walk back.

742
01:15:45,976 --> 01:15:48,576
Are you sure?
It's along way.

743
01:15:48,864 --> 01:15:50,493
I'm sure.

744
01:15:53,758 --> 01:15:57,495
- Call me if you change your mind. - I don't need that.
- Take it, just in case.

745
01:16:01,409 --> 01:16:03,159
See you home, okay?

746
01:16:05,261 --> 01:16:07,261
Okay?
- Yes.

747
01:16:08,666 --> 01:16:10,166
Later.

748
01:16:49,138 --> 01:16:51,208
Have I done something wrong ? Jane!

749
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:57,348
No, Michael,
You did everything just right.

750
01:16:57,536 --> 01:17:01,116
You left Christopher alone in a wheat field.
- He wanted to walk home.

751
01:17:01,159 --> 01:17:04,601
- And you let him ?
- Yes. Yes I did, he's not an infant Jane.

752
01:17:04,695 --> 01:17:07,650
You left him 4 hours ago,
and he's not home, is he ?

753
01:17:07,727 --> 01:17:09,286
He'll be fine.

754
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:12,474
You're like a human shit trail.

755
01:17:12,762 --> 01:17:16,255
Everything you do, everything you touch,
turns to crap.

756
01:17:16,455 --> 01:17:19,133
Why don't you put that
in your precious little book.

757
01:17:43,976 --> 01:17:47,221
Red Socks or White Socks,
when is gonna be the cubs turn ?

758
01:17:47,508 --> 01:17:49,402
***.

759
01:17:50,413 --> 01:17:52,098
I'm gonna be the pitcher.

760
01:17:52,845 --> 01:17:55,252
Your mother was a pretty good pitcher,
when she was a girl.

761
01:17:55,928 --> 01:17:58,178
- Yes ?
- Your cousin was pretty good too.

762
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:01,258
- Ryne ?
- No, Michael.

763
01:18:01,870 --> 01:18:03,512
He could hit.

764
01:18:04,735 --> 01:18:09,221
The kind of swing you just can't teach.
Nice and easy and natural.

765
01:18:11,038 --> 01:18:12,638
One day ...

766
01:18:13,642 --> 01:18:15,265
he's getting to his head...

767
01:18:15,412 --> 01:18:19,280
to swing for the fence
every time he stepped up to the point...

768
01:18:19,792 --> 01:18:23,805
slap and sings was never good enough
for your uncle Charlie...

769
01:18:27,738 --> 01:18:29,888
- Where are you going ?
- To the bathroom.

770
01:18:34,433 --> 01:18:35,833
Here.

771
01:18:38,306 --> 01:18:40,456
- In case someone calls.
- Got it.

772
01:18:42,158 --> 01:18:45,653
- Who's in charge ? - I am.
- Right.

773
01:20:03,989 --> 01:20:05,489
Michael ?

774
01:20:06,369 --> 01:20:08,019
Are you awake ?

775
01:20:10,173 --> 01:20:11,382
Yes.

776
01:20:12,775 --> 01:20:15,933
You put a real beat on your old man
you know that ?

777
01:20:18,189 --> 01:20:20,189
Please look at me, Michael.

778
01:20:20,654 --> 01:20:22,754
I really need you to look at me now.

779
01:20:39,273 --> 01:20:41,373
Your mother and I had a talk.

780
01:20:42,549 --> 01:20:45,834
There's gonna be some big changes around here.
Big changes.

781
01:20:46,663 --> 01:20:48,137
I'm gonna change.

782
01:20:50,718 --> 01:20:51,968
Yes ?

783
01:20:54,138 --> 01:20:55,938
I'm gonna try.

784
01:21:00,045 --> 01:21:01,695
You believe me?

785
01:21:02,757 --> 01:21:03,957
Yes.

786
01:21:12,371 --> 01:21:14,321
Good night Michael.

787
01:21:22,023 --> 01:21:23,773
Good night, Dad.

788
01:21:43,430 --> 01:21:45,306
You're not the boss of me.

789
01:21:45,623 --> 01:21:48,834
- You wanna know why ?
- Why?

790
01:21:52,861 --> 01:21:56,578
Because I could like totally
kick your ass in a fight ...

791
01:21:57,108 --> 01:21:59,258
like you can't ever imagine.

792
01:22:07,492 --> 01:22:09,592
Do you think they will find Christopher ?

793
01:22:10,995 --> 01:22:12,745
I hope not.

794
01:22:15,203 --> 01:22:17,203
Of course they're gonna find Christopher.

795
01:22:19,184 --> 01:22:21,184
But what if he's dead?

796
01:22:23,659 --> 01:22:25,409
Look at me ...

797
01:22:27,009 --> 01:22:30,092
Nobody's gonna die.
I promise you.

798
01:22:32,550 --> 01:22:34,550
We're all gonna die someday.

799
01:22:39,653 --> 01:22:41,653
Yes, we are.

800
01:22:44,128 --> 01:22:48,311
But, you know ... Nobody's really dead
as long as you always remember them.

801
01:22:50,369 --> 01:22:53,119
Want to know how I always remember my mom ?

802
01:22:56,131 --> 01:22:58,031
I look at my watch ...

803
01:22:58,259 --> 01:23:00,073
When all the numbers line up ...

804
01:23:00,190 --> 01:23:03,770
Like 11:11, 2:22, 3:33 ...

805
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:06,892
When those numbers line up,
it is a reminder.

806
01:23:08,379 --> 01:23:11,136
It reminds me to tell my mom I love her.

807
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:14,125
- You check your watch pretty much.
- Yes.

808
01:23:15,899 --> 01:23:17,161
Yes.

809
01:23:18,943 --> 01:23:22,846
We were barely able to use the video camera,
and you know how much ...

810
01:23:23,171 --> 01:23:27,103
your aunt Lisa hated to have a picture taken ?
- She hated it.

811
01:23:29,772 --> 01:23:31,822
So, the clock game, that's all I got.

812
01:23:33,701 --> 01:23:35,911
Leslie?
- Yes, Uncle Charlie ?

813
01:23:36,096 --> 01:23:39,098
Will you help me up the stairs ?
- I can.

814
01:23:39,193 --> 01:23:42,643
No, you stay down here
in case Christopher comes back.

815
01:24:14,288 --> 01:24:16,630
Come on, baby.
Where are you?

816
01:24:20,597 --> 01:24:23,253
Don't worry Jane,
I'm sure Christopher will be fine.

817
01:24:23,312 --> 01:24:25,418
Kelly, don't tell me not to worry.

818
01:24:25,477 --> 01:24:28,948
You don't have a kid,
you don't know the fuck what you're talking about, so just don't...

819
01:24:31,335 --> 01:24:34,035
Do not tell me not to worry.

820
01:24:35,473 --> 01:24:37,896
What are we doing in the attic, Uncle Charlie ?

821
01:24:38,167 --> 01:24:40,081
I just remembered something.

822
01:24:40,363 --> 01:24:43,001
- What ?
- Just hold on.

823
01:24:43,325 --> 01:24:45,325
Patience.

824
01:24:45,526 --> 01:24:47,293
Patience is a virtue.

825
01:24:47,793 --> 01:24:49,404
Catch it if you can.

826
01:24:49,534 --> 01:24:52,391
Rarely found in women,
never found in men.

827
01:24:55,019 --> 01:24:56,469
Charles ?

828
01:24:57,039 --> 01:24:58,864
Michael ?

829
01:24:59,770 --> 01:25:03,748
Oh my God.
Oh God. Is he all okay ?

830
01:25:07,135 --> 01:25:08,975
Is there firecrackers in there ?

831
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:12,130
Why would they be firecrackers ?

832
01:25:14,726 --> 01:25:17,308
This is what I was looking for.

833
01:25:18,566 --> 01:25:20,324
What's that ?

834
01:25:20,945 --> 01:25:22,695
Something beautiful.

835
01:25:24,714 --> 01:25:26,002
You're right.

836
01:25:27,666 --> 01:25:31,210
I don't imagine what it would be
to be responsible for something.

837
01:25:31,957 --> 01:25:33,607
Someone ...

838
01:25:34,326 --> 01:25:37,223
entirely depending on me.

839
01:25:38,006 --> 01:25:40,766
On me.
I am such a fuck up.

840
01:25:40,966 --> 01:25:42,966
What are you talking about, Kelly?

841
01:25:46,941 --> 01:25:49,156
I just hope she's healthy.

842
01:25:53,497 --> 01:25:56,450
She will be healthy.

843
01:25:59,543 --> 01:26:03,743
- How is Michael ... doing with this?
- He doesn't know yet.

844
01:26:04,790 --> 01:26:06,399
Kelly ...

845
01:26:06,899 --> 01:26:08,704
don't hurt him.

846
01:26:08,939 --> 01:26:11,039
Don't you dare hurt him.

847
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:14,008
Michael has been hurt enough already.

848
01:26:14,878 --> 01:26:16,271
I know.

849
01:26:17,070 --> 01:26:18,451
I know.

850
01:26:26,987 --> 01:26:29,037
Well, we are in the right place.

851
01:26:29,863 --> 01:26:31,863
Your mother's gonna kill me.

852
01:26:36,773 --> 01:26:39,320
- Christopher, are you okay?
- I'm fine, Mom.

853
01:26:57,016 --> 01:26:59,131
Who is that ?
- That is your pappy.

854
01:26:59,983 --> 01:27:01,983
That's nana.

855
01:27:12,726 --> 01:27:15,051


856
01:27:23,563 --> 01:27:25,456
That's me.

857
01:29:26,888 --> 01:29:28,503
Let me get that.

858
01:29:28,598 --> 01:29:31,104
Come on, honey,
You shouldn't...

859
01:29:40,675 --> 01:29:42,617
These should fit.

860
01:29:54,938 --> 01:29:58,438
Hey, you know?
Seems like you've grown a foot since I got here, Blondie.

861
01:29:58,508 --> 01:30:00,658
- It's impossible.
- Yeah, whatever.

862
01:30:00,762 --> 01:30:02,584
Wish we had spend more time together.

863
01:30:03,484 --> 01:30:04,687
That will change.

864
01:30:04,941 --> 01:30:07,091
- I'd like that Michael.
- Me too.

865
01:30:08,814 --> 01:30:10,814


866
01:30:11,914 --> 01:30:15,725
We have something to tell you.
You tell them.

867
01:30:16,101 --> 01:30:18,096
No, you.
Please don't.

868
01:30:19,551 --> 01:30:21,651
- I'm pregnant.
- I knew it!

869
01:30:21,857 --> 01:30:23,679
Oh my God, Kelly.
- Thank you.

870
01:30:23,810 --> 01:30:25,510
Awesome !

871
01:30:27,408 --> 01:30:28,611
Well ?

872
01:30:29,516 --> 01:30:31,516
What do you think,
you're gonna be grandfather ?

873
01:30:32,827 --> 01:30:34,227
I think ...

874
01:30:35,056 --> 01:30:37,491
I think your mother
would have been very happy.

875
01:30:38,914 --> 01:30:40,714
She was happy. Dad.

876
01:30:43,544 --> 01:30:46,019
Send me a copy of your new book.

877
01:30:46,131 --> 01:30:49,510
- That's not gonna be published.
- Why not?

878
01:30:55,495 --> 01:30:59,142
When will you be coming back ?
- Soon. Very soon.

879
01:31:05,815 --> 01:31:08,231
Wait a second. Give me a hug.
Come on.

880
01:31:08,419 --> 01:31:10,569
What do you say ?
See you soon.

881
01:31:10,707 --> 01:31:12,547
- Yes.
- Come on girl.

882
01:31:33,378 --> 01:31:35,842
If it's a girl,
Michael and I love the name Sadie.

883
01:31:35,939 --> 01:31:38,530
- Sadie ? No.
- What's wrong with Sadie?

884
01:31:38,765 --> 01:31:41,119
- Like the Beatles song ?
- Sexy Sadie?

885
01:31:41,195 --> 01:31:43,302
This is a scar for life.

886
01:31:43,361 --> 01:31:46,043
- She knows the Beatles!
- Yes I know the Beatles.

887
01:31:46,549 --> 01:31:47,965
And if it is a boy ?

888
01:31:48,042 --> 01:31:51,242
We haven't really thought of a name for a boy,
have we honey ?

889
01:31:52,605 --> 01:31:53,955
Max.

890
01:31:54,054 --> 01:31:56,154
I like Max.
Why Max?

891
01:31:57,753 --> 01:31:59,728
Mom would have loved that.

892
01:32:01,045 --> 01:32:02,494
Max.

893
01:32:02,994 --> 01:32:04,744
I like that. It's nice.

894
