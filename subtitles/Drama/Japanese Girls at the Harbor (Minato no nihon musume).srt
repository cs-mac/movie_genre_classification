get to see you again.

alone with you.

Ah! There we go.

507

See, this is as close as
I could get you to your ship.

508
00:24:26,979 --> 00:24:29,311
So, at least I tried, right?

509
00:24:30,749 --> 00:24:33,081
Actually, you know what?
This is better.

510

of us all, Rafe?

513
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:05,979
Well, the future's not
exactly in our hands, is it?

514
00:25:06,018 --> 00:25:08,782
No. I guess you're right.

1148

Danny, I had a wonderful
time last night. I--

1149

It's just all too fast.

1150
01:05:34,510 --> 01:05:36,978
Listen, Evelyn, I was just down
at the beach this morning...

1151
01:05:37,013 --> 01:05:38,878
and I watched the sun rise...

1152
01:05:38,915 --> 01:05:40,906

was gonna be different.

That this was the start
of something new.

In this place, in this moment.

1155

And I don't care what
anybody else says, you know?

How can I not feel this way?

1157

I kinda like you.

1158

Sir, I believe
they'll try to hit us...

where it'll hurt us the most--
Pearl Harbor.

1188
01:08:20,042 --> 01:08:23,273
It's over 4,000 nautical miles
from Japan to Pearl.

1189
01:08:23,312 --> 01:08:27,544
<i>That's a long distance

01:08:29,852 --> 01:08:32,582

<i>ADMlRAL; That's not exactly

Well, Admiral,
if I had hard evidence...

1194
01:08:37,026 --> 01:08:38,516
we'd already be at war.

1195
01:08:38,561 --> 01:08:40,324
Sir, we can read
their diplomatic codes...

1196
01:08:40,363 --> 01:08:41,625
<i>faster than they can type them,</i>

1197

But Captain Thurman's

1198
01:08:43,399 --> 01:08:45,060
is still trying
to crack the naval codes.

1199
01:08:45,268 --> 01:08:47,998
The intercepts have missing
words and garbled lines...

1200
01:08:48,037 --> 01:08:51,837
so to explain the decrypts,
we have to try to interpret...

1201
01:08:51,874 --> 01:08:52,966

they're trying to do.

1202
01:08:53,009 --> 01:08:56,308
Interpret?
You mean guess.

1203
01:08:56,345 --> 01:08:58,813

We guess.

1205

It's like playing chess
in the dark.

1206

we pay attention to it.

1208

When I was in
the Asiatic Fleet...

1209
01:09:09,792 --> 01:09:11,987
the locals used to try
to get outside of a problem...

1210
01:09:12,028 --> 01:09:13,495

<i>the Pacific Fleet's
ability to make war,</i>

1215
01:09:20,436 --> 01:09:23,667
So, sir, you would have us
mobilize the entire fleet...

1216
01:09:23,706 --> 01:09:26,732
at the cost
of millions of dollars...

1226

that I knew I'd been a fool
for leaving you...

2056
02:16:52,581 --> 02:16:54,708
trying to go over there
and be a hero...

2057
02:16:56,184 --> 02:16:58,152
and I promised I'd never ask
for anything again...

2058
02:16:59,321 --> 02:17:02,256
if I could just see you
one more time.

2059
02:17:05,694 --> 02:17:07,059
And you know what?

2060
02:17:09,164 --> 02:17:10,461
It was worth it.

2061
02:17:12,401 --> 02:17:15,768
You kept me alive, Evelyn.
You brought me home.

2062
02:17:16,872 --> 02:17:19,306
So I'm gonna stand by
my end of the deal.

2063
02:17:19,341 --> 02:17:21,138
I'm gonna walk away.

2064
02:17:21,176 --> 02:17:24,441
And I won't ask you
for anything.

2065
02:17:24,479 --> 02:17:26,310
But I just want to know why.

2066
02:17:26,348 --> 02:17:29,340
Just tell me that, will you,
please? Just tell me why.

2067
02:17:30,819 --> 02:17:33,117
Rafe, I'm pregnant.

2068
02:17:42,197 --> 02:17:43,789
Oh, my God.

2069
02:17:47,302 --> 02:17:50,601
I didn't even know until
the day you turned up alive.

2070
02:17:52,374 --> 02:17:55,138
I haven't told Danny.

2071
02:17:55,177 --> 02:17:57,338
I don't want him to know.

2072
02:17:57,379 --> 02:17:59,313
All he needs to think about...

2073
02:17:59,348 --> 02:18:02,181
is how to do this mission
and get back alive.

2074
02:18:04,820 --> 02:18:08,278
Rafe, all I ever wanted...

2075
02:18:08,323 --> 02:18:11,486
was for us to have a home,
grow old together...

2076
02:18:11,526 --> 02:18:14,518
but life never asked me
what I wanted.

2077
02:18:14,563 --> 02:18:17,691
Now, I'm gonna give Danny
my whole heart...

2078
02:18:19,668 --> 02:18:22,137
but I don't think I'll ever
look at another sunset...

2079
02:18:22,137 --> 02:18:23,798
without thinking of you.

2080
02:18:27,876 --> 02:18:29,707
I'll love you my whole life.

2081
02:19:07,582 --> 02:19:09,482
I'll see you on board.

2082
02:19:27,102 --> 02:19:31,163
You know, the only thing
that scares me...

2083
02:19:31,206 --> 02:19:33,800
is that you might love him
more than you love me.

2084
02:19:36,511 --> 02:19:38,775
I love you, Danny.

2085
02:19:41,216 --> 02:19:44,117
And I'll be here waiting
for you when you come back.

2086
02:20:02,204 --> 02:20:03,398
Follow me.

2087
02:20:07,175 --> 02:20:08,540
Colonel.

2088
02:20:12,714 --> 02:20:14,545
Congratulations
on your promotion, sir.

2089
02:20:14,583 --> 02:20:15,914
I heard what you did.

2090
02:20:16,118 --> 02:20:18,120
We can explain that, sir.

2091
02:20:18,120 --> 02:20:19,815
Explain what?

2092
02:20:19,855 --> 02:20:22,688
Whatever it is
you heard about us, sir.

2093
02:20:22,724 --> 02:20:24,487
You mean the hula shirts
you were flying in?

2094
02:20:29,765 --> 02:20:32,165
Or the seven planes
you shot down?

2095
02:20:35,303 --> 02:20:38,761
You're both being awarded
the Silver Star...

2096
02:20:38,807 --> 02:20:40,672
and promoted to captain.

2097
02:20:42,277 --> 02:20:44,609
Is that the good news,
sir, or...

2098
02:20:44,646 --> 02:20:46,409
You're just about
the only pilots in the Army...

2099
02:20:46,448 --> 02:20:48,784
with combat experience.

2100
02:20:48,784 --> 02:20:50,411
I need you for a mission...

2101
02:20:50,452 --> 02:20:52,613
I've been ordered
to put together.

2102
02:20:54,289 --> 02:20:55,813
You know what top secret is?

2103
02:20:55,857 --> 02:20:57,325
Yes, sir.

2104
02:20:57,325 --> 02:20:59,850
It's the kind of mission
where you get medals.

2105
02:20:59,895 --> 02:21:02,297
But they send 'em
to your relatives.

2106
02:21:02,297 --> 02:21:04,424
Top secret means
you train for something...

2107
02:21:04,499 --> 02:21:06,865
never done before
in aviation history...

2108
02:21:06,902 --> 02:21:09,200
and you go without knowing
where you're going.

2109
02:21:10,472 --> 02:21:14,203
You do it on that basis
or not at all.

2110
02:21:14,242 --> 02:21:15,539
I'll go, sir.

2111
02:21:16,545 --> 02:21:18,445
I'll go, too, sir.

2112
02:21:20,582 --> 02:21:23,779
By the way, the Brits sent
over your personal effects.

2113
02:21:23,819 --> 02:21:25,184
Thank you, sir.

2114

<i>DOOLlTTLE;
There's only one more thing,</i>

2115
02:21:26,555 --> 02:21:29,786
Leave your goddamn hula shirts
at home.

2116
02:21:42,637 --> 02:21:44,764
The mission I'm asking you
to volunteer for...

2117
02:21:44,806 --> 02:21:46,398
is exceptionally dangerous.

2118
02:21:46,441 --> 02:21:49,808
<i>Take a look at the man
beside you,</i>

2119

you or he...

2121
02:21:55,684 --> 02:21:56,844
will be dead.

2122
02:22:00,155 --> 02:22:02,589
Everyone brave enough
to accept this...

2123
02:22:03,892 --> 02:22:05,655
step forward.

2124
02:22:13,735 --> 02:22:15,669
<i>Your gr andmother
could take a B-25 off,,,</i>

2125
02:22:15,704 --> 02:22:18,273
on a mile-long runway.

2126
02:22:18,273 --> 02:22:23,176
Well, I'm gonna train you
to do it in 467 feet.

2127
02:22:23,211 --> 02:22:26,669
Because at 468 feet...

2128
02:22:26,715 --> 02:22:28,740
you're dead.

2129
02:22:28,783 --> 02:22:29,875
And once you get it up...

2130
02:22:29,918 --> 02:22:32,682
you'll learn to fly it
like a fighter...

2131
02:22:32,721 --> 02:22:34,848
thirty feet off the ground.

2132
02:22:34,890 --> 02:22:36,357
I want you to say hello...

2133
02:22:36,391 --> 02:22:38,689
<i>to Lieutenant Jack Richards,
Navy Aviation.</i>

<i>He'll help us
lighten these fat ladies,</i>

02:22:42,130 --> 02:22:43,290
Dump that ashcan.

2136

See that bomb sight?
Get rid of it.

2137
02:22:45,600 --> 02:22:47,295
Colonel, he's crazy!

2138
02:22:47,335 --> 02:22:49,428
-The lady's fat!
-Listen to him.

2139
02:22:49,471 --> 02:22:51,371
She's fat.
We want a skinny lady!

2140

DOOLITTLE: They just keep
rolling past that line.

2145
02:23:15,630 --> 02:23:17,188

Maybe it's a bad idea.

2146

<i>No, they're too heavy.

2159
02:24:14,122 --> 02:24:15,612
And we're gonna bomb it.

2160

[Cheering]

2161
02:24:21,629 --> 02:24:23,460
That comes
as a special request...

2162
02:24:23,498 --> 02:24:25,762
directly from
President Roosevelt.

2163
02:24:25,800 --> 02:24:29,327
<i>The Navy'll sneak us about
400 miles off the coast...</i>

2164
02:24:29,371 --> 02:24:30,702
and we'll launch
from the carrier there.

2165
02:24:30,739 --> 02:24:32,263
Has that been done before?

2166
02:24:33,441 --> 02:24:34,840
<i>Taking Army bombers
off Navy carriers?</i>

-No.
-OK.

2168
02:24:38,213 --> 02:24:39,805
Any other questions?

2169
02:24:39,848 --> 02:24:42,112
Well, sir, is it even
possible to land...

2170
02:24:42,150 --> 02:24:44,311
a B-25
on an aircraft carrier deck?

2171
02:24:44,352 --> 02:24:46,149
That won't matter.

2172
02:24:46,187 --> 02:24:49,520
As soon as we're airborne,
the carrier heads for Hawaii.

2173
02:24:49,557 --> 02:24:51,684
But without them,
where do we land?

2174
02:24:51,726 --> 02:24:54,593
I have a phrase
I want you to memorize.

2175
02:24:56,164 --> 02:24:59,292
<i>Wo shi mei guo ren,</i>

2176
02:24:59,334 --> 02:25:01,529
It means ''I am an American''.

2177
02:25:03,171 --> 02:25:05,105
In Chinese.

2178
02:25:06,241 --> 02:25:07,708
Ain't gonna be any easier.

2179
02:25:07,742 --> 02:25:10,438
That's three feet shorter
than our practice runway.

2180
02:25:10,478 --> 02:25:13,504
-Fellas?
-Sir.

2181
02:25:13,548 --> 02:25:14,742
Sir.

2182
02:25:16,651 --> 02:25:18,414
<i>Secretary of the Navy
gave me these.</i>

2183
02:25:19,854 --> 02:25:21,287
What are they?

2184
02:25:21,322 --> 02:25:23,222
Friendship medals
the Japanese gave us...

2185
02:25:23,258 --> 02:25:24,816
when they were pretending
to want peace.

2186
02:25:24,859 --> 02:25:26,326
What'll you do with them?

2187
02:25:26,361 --> 02:25:28,829
Wire them to the bombs
and give them back.

2188
02:25:32,233 --> 02:25:34,326
So what's going on?

2189
02:25:34,369 --> 02:25:36,394
Well, sir,
we only have sixteen planes.

2190
02:25:36,438 --> 02:25:37,632
So?

2191
02:25:37,672 --> 02:25:41,109
When the Japs hit us,
they had more than 300.

2192
02:25:41,109 --> 02:25:43,304
How much difference
can we make?

2193
02:25:43,344 --> 02:25:45,244
<i>lt's not that we're afr aid,
sir,</i>

2194
02:25:45,280 --> 02:25:48,647
But we might die, and
we want to know what it's for.

2195
02:25:51,719 --> 02:25:54,586
You know, at Pearl,
they hit us with a sledgehammer.

2196
02:25:56,491 --> 02:25:59,688
This raid,
even if we make it through...

2197
02:25:59,727 --> 02:26:03,163
it'll only be a pinprick...

2198
02:26:03,198 --> 02:26:04,859
but it'll be straight
through their hearts.

2199
02:26:06,367 --> 02:26:09,803
<i>Victory belongs to those
that believe in it the most,,,</i>

2200
02:26:09,838 --> 02:26:11,430
and believe in it the longest.

2201
02:26:13,174 --> 02:26:15,642
We're gonna believe.

2202
02:26:15,677 --> 02:26:17,838
We're gonna make
America believe, too.

Some flyboy you're dating
shot his mouth off.

Actually,
it's about two pilots.

into great danger.

thrown you in the brig.

02:29:20,261 --> 02:29:23,287
but you said China is
overrun with Japanese troops.

What if the beacons
are switched off?

I wasn't built
to be a prisoner...

2261

so I would have
my crew bail out.

2262
02:29:49,157 --> 02:29:51,717
I'd find the sweetest
military target I could...

2263
02:29:51,759 --> 02:29:53,852
and drive my plane right
smack into the middle of it...

2264

of those bastards as I could.
