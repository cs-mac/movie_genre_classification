1
00:00:04,573 --> 00:00:09,272
According to the report
on Takeda's condition,

2
00:00:09,344 --> 00:00:10,470
"One.

3
00:00:10,545 --> 00:00:13,810
Recognition of self and others

4
00:00:13,882 --> 00:00:18,251
as human beings is very low.

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,689
The ability to understand
this situation is poor.

6
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:25,487
Two.

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,688
Takes words at face value,

8
00:00:28,763 --> 00:00:32,221
poor concept of the abstract."

9
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,234
- "Mother died recently...
- Three.

10
00:00:34,302 --> 00:00:37,533
- I'm not really sure...
- Has no concept of his future...

11
00:00:37,606 --> 00:00:41,440
- I got word from her retirement home...
- He cannot express his dreams...

12
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:44,910
- 'Regret to inform you of the loss...
- There is a lack of imagination.

13
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:49,280
- of your mother.' This says nothing.
- Four. Tendency to delve.

14
00:00:49,351 --> 00:00:55,017
- It probably happened yesterday.
- Repeatedly pursues interests."

15
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:58,753
Her retirement home is 80 kilometers
from Algiers in Marengo.

16
00:00:58,827 --> 00:01:02,661
I could arrive this afternoon
if I take the 2:00 bus."

17
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:32,524
Good night.

18
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,336
Do you live nearby?

19
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,708
Yes, about 10 minutes.

20
00:01:50,779 --> 00:01:52,770
Can I sit next to you?

21
00:01:52,847 --> 00:01:54,178
Yes.

22
00:02:08,763 --> 00:02:12,290
Why did you stop making movies?

23
00:02:14,035 --> 00:02:16,595
I heard you made a lot of great films.

24
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:24,201
I also heard
you don't like discussing the past.

25
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:27,672
Won't you tell me?

26
00:02:27,749 --> 00:02:30,343
You're a strange one, Mr. Ikeda.

27
00:02:30,418 --> 00:02:31,783
Do you think so?

28
00:02:31,853 --> 00:02:33,445
Just look at your clothes.

29
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:35,989
Is it too feminine?

30
00:02:36,057 --> 00:02:38,116
Maybe.

31
00:02:38,193 --> 00:02:42,152
I used to dress up as a woman.

32
00:02:43,431 --> 00:02:44,523
Ms. Hisada.

33
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:49,136
Are you on your own?

34
00:02:49,204 --> 00:02:51,001
Apparently.

35
00:02:51,072 --> 00:02:55,532
I mean, when is your boyfriend
coming back?

36
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,703
Next Monday.

37
00:02:57,779 --> 00:02:59,144
Are you lonely?

38
00:02:59,214 --> 00:03:01,739
What do you mean?

39
00:03:03,518 --> 00:03:08,080
Motosugi seems to like you.

40
00:03:09,657 --> 00:03:13,286
He's very well built.

41
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:16,720
Do you have a girlfriend?

42
00:03:18,533 --> 00:03:20,262
Not at the moment.

43
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:27,201
After the film,
I want to take a trip abroad.

44
00:03:29,244 --> 00:03:31,610
For the first time.

45
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:33,510
On your own?

46
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:35,481
I guess.

47
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,144
All by your lonesome?

48
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:42,781
There's no one to go with.

49
00:03:45,226 --> 00:03:46,716
Am I odd?

50
00:03:46,795 --> 00:03:48,660
Who knows?

51
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,903
Professor...

52
00:04:02,343 --> 00:04:05,278
When I was 16,
I had a bit of a run in

53
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:08,281
with my English teacher.

54
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:12,843
A fifty something American man.

55
00:04:15,223 --> 00:04:17,851
He forced me back to his apartment.

56
00:04:17,926 --> 00:04:19,894
Made me do a blowjob.

57
00:04:29,404 --> 00:04:31,838
That was my first
and last time with a man.

58
00:04:33,975 --> 00:04:36,705
I dream about having sex.

59
00:04:36,778 --> 00:04:39,406
But it's always with a girl.

60
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:43,374
I'm not gay, you know.

61
00:04:45,787 --> 00:04:50,019
Machu Picchu, the city in the sky
with its holy valley.

62
00:04:50,091 --> 00:04:52,855
Sounds fantastic, eh?

63
00:04:52,927 --> 00:04:56,055
I would prefer going to Greece.

64
00:04:57,465 --> 00:04:59,990
It's a long way from South America.

65
00:05:00,068 --> 00:05:01,695
I'll say it is.

66
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,639
I'm glad I study here.

67
00:05:09,711 --> 00:05:12,145
I met you, for one thing.

68
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:34,691
Do you know what
the students call you?

69
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:36,634
I wonder.

70
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:38,729
- Venice.
- Venice?

71
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:42,708
Some lecturers call you Aschenbach.

72
00:05:46,281 --> 00:05:48,044
From "Death in Venice"?

73
00:05:58,793 --> 00:06:03,628
I've heard of the director
and the actress, but continuity girl?

74
00:06:13,408 --> 00:06:15,774
It's late. You should go.

75
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:17,401
Okay.

76
00:06:19,314 --> 00:06:20,372
Goodnight.

77
00:06:51,312 --> 00:06:55,146
THURSDAY

78
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,244
We need extras for our film.

79
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:30,378
Okay, my best three murder movies.

80
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:35,218
Hitchcock's "Psycho,"
Jean-Pierre Melville's "Samurai,"

81
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:37,519
Fritz Lang's "You Only Live Once."

82
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:42,059
Here's my best three.

83
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:46,396
Coppola's "Godfather,"
Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction,"

84
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:49,925
the name escapes me, but
"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly."

85
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,909
Morning.

86
00:08:06,988 --> 00:08:08,353
Are you okay?

87
00:08:08,423 --> 00:08:10,323
Didn't sleep a wink.

88
00:08:10,391 --> 00:08:12,416
Thinking about the storyboard?

89
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:13,824
Yukari.

90
00:08:13,895 --> 00:08:16,022
What's up with Adele?

91
00:08:16,097 --> 00:08:19,658
Adele... I mean Yukari

92
00:08:19,734 --> 00:08:23,261
came over at 3:00 this morning.

93
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:26,602
Surely you were in bed.

94
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:32,340
Trouble is, Aya was in my bed.

95
00:08:32,413 --> 00:08:36,577
That's tricky.

96
00:08:36,651 --> 00:08:38,312
Bummer.

97
00:08:38,386 --> 00:08:41,048
So what did Yukari do?

98
00:08:42,757 --> 00:08:45,317
Poor, poor me!

99
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:51,362
I feel wretched!

100
00:08:53,601 --> 00:08:56,331
I'm pitiful!

101
00:08:57,438 --> 00:08:59,235
For fuck's sake get inside!

102
00:09:01,109 --> 00:09:02,098
Yukari!

103
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:06,374
What did Aya do?

104
00:09:07,982 --> 00:09:12,976
When I got back,
she was snoring in bed.

105
00:09:14,322 --> 00:09:16,756
- Never could figure out women.
- Too right.

106
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,546
First one way, then the other.

107
00:09:48,619 --> 00:09:52,282
We walked all over the neighborhood
until morning.

108
00:09:52,356 --> 00:09:54,756
I'm pooped.

109
00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:06,026
I've had just about enough,
what with thinking about the film.

110
00:10:06,103 --> 00:10:08,503
No shit.

111
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:14,202
"Nozomi, from the rear seat. Subdued.

112
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:18,305
Nozomi: '... umm, I'm that ugly?'

113
00:10:18,382 --> 00:10:20,816
Yamazaki: 'What?'

114
00:10:20,885 --> 00:10:24,981
Nozomi: 'Should I have a nose job?'

115
00:10:25,056 --> 00:10:28,219
Yamasaki:
'Are you out of your fucking head?'

116
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:31,352
Nozomi: 'I'm sorry.'

117
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:36,389
Nozomi, monologue:
'He laughed at me, this fat pig.

118
00:10:36,467 --> 00:10:40,028
Makes me uncomfortable.
He wants me to get out.

119
00:10:40,104 --> 00:10:44,905
Maybe my outfit was too loud.
I want to be alone.

120
00:10:44,976 --> 00:10:47,171
I can't take it any more..."'

121
00:10:59,156 --> 00:11:02,091
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

122
00:11:07,732 --> 00:11:10,462
Okay, break's over.
Back to rehearsal.

123
00:11:11,535 --> 00:11:12,502
Motosugi.

124
00:11:17,074 --> 00:11:18,507
Take a look at this.

125
00:11:21,145 --> 00:11:25,275
"1:32 P.M. Traitor! I'll kill you!

126
00:11:25,349 --> 00:11:29,649
2:15. I love you.
Good luck with the movie.

127
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:35,215
3:44. I am 'Adele'.
I'll follow you everywhere.

128
00:11:35,293 --> 00:11:39,354
4:27. I'm not 'Adele'.

129
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:42,365
Don't leave me. I'll wait at home."

130
00:11:46,971 --> 00:11:47,938
Mr. Matsukawa!

131
00:11:51,175 --> 00:11:54,542
We've fixed the location
for the old woman's house.

132
00:11:54,612 --> 00:11:55,579
Thanks.

133
00:11:55,646 --> 00:11:58,410
We can use the furniture there.

134
00:11:58,482 --> 00:11:59,574
Thanks.

135
00:12:06,624 --> 00:12:07,591
Professor.

136
00:12:07,658 --> 00:12:09,182
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

137
00:12:10,795 --> 00:12:11,762
Morning.

138
00:12:18,669 --> 00:12:23,606
Everyone seems so deflated.

139
00:12:23,674 --> 00:12:27,906
Making movies is a tough business.

140
00:12:27,979 --> 00:12:30,675
After the movie comes job hunting.

141
00:12:30,748 --> 00:12:34,809
Would a production company
want me?

142
00:12:34,885 --> 00:12:36,352
Not sure.

143
00:12:38,322 --> 00:12:40,256
You'll go post grad?

144
00:12:40,324 --> 00:12:44,784
Not sure. I don't like the movies
they make these days.

145
00:12:44,862 --> 00:12:48,730
You should. There's a lot to learn.

146
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:50,630
This is a good college for film.

147
00:13:01,612 --> 00:13:04,513
I'm going to take a look.

148
00:13:04,582 --> 00:13:10,521
"THE BORED MURDERER"

149
00:13:10,588 --> 00:13:13,887
Help me, someone!

150
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:17,121
Help!

151
00:13:19,363 --> 00:13:22,389
Just as well we insured her.

152
00:13:22,466 --> 00:13:26,368
Why did he murder her?
Why did he murder her?

153
00:13:26,437 --> 00:13:27,961
Playing too many computer games?

154
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:30,769
The culprit is a computer...
Too many games...

155
00:13:30,841 --> 00:13:33,503
Computer's fault...
Computer's to blame...

156
00:13:33,577 --> 00:13:37,911
The murder scene
is too scary to watch.

157
00:13:37,982 --> 00:13:41,145
Definitely a computer...
The computer is the murderer...

158
00:13:58,702 --> 00:14:03,696
I tried the murder scene
with hatred in my eyes.

159
00:14:03,774 --> 00:14:05,833
But I get the feeling that's wrong.

160
00:14:06,877 --> 00:14:08,811
I agree.

161
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:11,473
He should have
a more normal look about him.

162
00:14:11,549 --> 00:14:14,382
You can't kill someone
with a normal look.

163
00:14:17,621 --> 00:14:18,849
Right, Nakane?

164
00:14:21,025 --> 00:14:21,992
What?

165
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:25,153
Let's ask Professor Nakajo.

166
00:14:25,229 --> 00:14:27,356
I say it should be hatred.

167
00:14:29,233 --> 00:14:31,758
Takeda is feeling hate.

168
00:14:36,674 --> 00:14:37,800
Let's do it again.

169
00:14:38,843 --> 00:14:39,867
With hatred.

170
00:14:47,985 --> 00:14:49,509
Which look is better?

171
00:14:49,587 --> 00:14:52,488
Beats me.

172
00:14:54,158 --> 00:14:55,716
He could try both.

173
00:14:55,793 --> 00:14:57,886
One look in each eye?

174
00:14:57,962 --> 00:14:58,929
Separately?

175
00:14:58,996 --> 00:15:00,759
Yes.

176
00:15:09,573 --> 00:15:11,040
You're like Groucho Marx!

177
00:15:17,748 --> 00:15:18,976
I can't see!

178
00:15:28,058 --> 00:15:29,923
It's Oyama.

179
00:15:29,994 --> 00:15:31,086
Come in.

180
00:15:38,669 --> 00:15:40,762
You wanted to see me?

181
00:15:45,142 --> 00:15:47,372
A word please, Motosugi.

182
00:15:47,444 --> 00:15:49,935
What?
Take care of this.

183
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:11,233
Did you call Yukari last night?

184
00:16:11,302 --> 00:16:13,497
Not me.

185
00:16:14,638 --> 00:16:18,130
Kamimura told you
about Naoki and Aya, right?

186
00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:19,403
Yep, I heard.

187
00:16:19,476 --> 00:16:21,740
Should I not have called her?

188
00:16:21,812 --> 00:16:25,270
So it was you.

189
00:16:27,952 --> 00:16:29,442
Need a piss.

190
00:16:34,358 --> 00:16:37,953
I want an explanation.

191
00:16:38,028 --> 00:16:43,796
I didn't call Adele.
I called her friend.

192
00:16:45,703 --> 00:16:47,068
Why?

193
00:16:48,872 --> 00:16:52,535
And I know you sent that poem
to Aya as well.

194
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,100
You must like her.

195
00:16:54,178 --> 00:16:55,577
No I don't.

196
00:16:55,646 --> 00:16:58,615
Well why did you make that call?

197
00:17:03,254 --> 00:17:06,087
I know what Naoki is like.

198
00:17:06,156 --> 00:17:10,092
He's very open,
and also the thing with Aya.

199
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,425
All the responsibility lies with him.

200
00:17:19,603 --> 00:17:21,696
I'm sick of the whole thing.

201
00:17:27,411 --> 00:17:31,871
Kiyoko, I think you like Naoki.

202
00:17:41,592 --> 00:17:43,059
I know it.

203
00:17:44,628 --> 00:17:48,564
You should see your eyes
when you look at him.

204
00:17:52,002 --> 00:17:53,492
Is that why?

205
00:17:54,638 --> 00:17:55,696
That's right.

206
00:18:04,148 --> 00:18:05,809
Grow up!

207
00:18:12,389 --> 00:18:14,983
Aya, are you okay?

208
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:16,583
Shouldn't I be?

209
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:20,152
Watch your step.
Adele has really become "Adele."

210
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:24,496
I'm staying at Naoki's
until the film is made.

211
00:18:27,738 --> 00:18:32,334
I can go to the set by bike
and save on travel expenses.

212
00:18:32,409 --> 00:18:37,039
Sounds like a plan.
Yep, that's what I'll do.

213
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:47,882
Let's eat first. I'm hungry.

214
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,687
Yeah. What do you want?

215
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,126
- Let's have ramen.
- Yeah, ramen!

216
00:19:07,277 --> 00:19:12,010
On top of that, inside is a tomato!

217
00:19:12,082 --> 00:19:13,379
- A tomato?
- Yeah.

218
00:19:16,086 --> 00:19:19,283
Your hair looks great.

219
00:19:19,356 --> 00:19:20,345
Really?

220
00:19:20,424 --> 00:19:22,449
I was waiting for you.

221
00:19:24,962 --> 00:19:26,691
I need to talk.

222
00:19:39,143 --> 00:19:40,405
I like you.

223
00:19:45,716 --> 00:19:47,013
I like you.

224
00:19:50,888 --> 00:19:53,982
We don't have to have sex,
but hug me.

225
00:19:58,662 --> 00:19:59,754
Please!

226
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,263
For my role.

227
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,122
Good night.

228
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:36,633
Night.

229
00:21:11,902 --> 00:21:14,063
We start the day after tomorrow.

230
00:21:14,137 --> 00:21:16,935
You should rest.

231
00:21:18,542 --> 00:21:20,567
Don't need it.
I'm young.

232
00:21:20,644 --> 00:21:24,080
I'm worried about team spirit.

233
00:21:26,283 --> 00:21:30,117
Sorry for the trouble
Yukari and I are causing.

234
00:21:31,722 --> 00:21:35,624
She's a bit odd.
Kind of passionate.

235
00:21:37,861 --> 00:21:41,262
I won't be seeing her after the film.

236
00:21:41,331 --> 00:21:43,891
For sure?

237
00:21:45,969 --> 00:21:47,129
100%.

238
00:21:51,174 --> 00:21:53,142
So, you don't like her?

239
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:55,735
I didn't say that.

240
00:21:55,812 --> 00:21:56,779
So, you like her.

241
00:21:59,249 --> 00:22:00,341
I wonder.

242
00:22:00,417 --> 00:22:02,146
Which?

243
00:22:03,787 --> 00:22:04,913
Not sure.

244
00:22:07,324 --> 00:22:10,760
Aya says she's staying
at your place.

245
00:22:10,827 --> 00:22:12,488
She's just...

246
00:22:12,563 --> 00:22:15,760
No feelings about Aya.

247
00:22:18,802 --> 00:22:20,201
That's my place.

248
00:22:22,005 --> 00:22:23,973
I've never been to your place.

249
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,066
Do you want to come in?

250
00:22:26,143 --> 00:22:27,610
I have tea.

251
00:22:27,678 --> 00:22:29,805
Sounds good to me.

252
00:22:44,161 --> 00:22:48,029
I wonder if I like you.

253
00:22:51,034 --> 00:22:52,831
I know I like you.

254
00:22:54,972 --> 00:22:56,030
You do?

255
00:22:56,106 --> 00:22:57,073
Yeah.

256
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:01,435
But you have a girl in every port.

257
00:23:02,713 --> 00:23:04,112
In every port?

258
00:23:04,181 --> 00:23:05,671
That's right.

259
00:23:08,051 --> 00:23:09,177
Perhaps.

260
00:23:11,622 --> 00:23:15,023
You slept with Aya last night.

261
00:23:17,394 --> 00:23:18,486
True.

262
00:23:20,831 --> 00:23:23,265
I have a lot to do so...

263
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:24,595
I should leave?

264
00:23:26,136 --> 00:23:27,194
True.

265
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:17,581
Good night.

266
00:24:40,844 --> 00:24:44,280
FRIDAY

267
00:25:52,616 --> 00:25:55,084
Professor, this is Rei Umemiya.

268
00:25:55,152 --> 00:25:56,119
Pleased to meet you.

269
00:25:56,186 --> 00:25:57,380
I'm Nakajo.

270
00:25:59,089 --> 00:26:04,026
I'm afraid I have to go
to a rehearsal now.

271
00:26:04,094 --> 00:26:05,186
Okay.

272
00:26:05,262 --> 00:26:06,661
I'll see you later.

273
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,027
See you then.

274
00:26:08,098 --> 00:26:11,158
Thanks for this, Mr. Oyama.

275
00:26:11,234 --> 00:26:13,828
Not at all.

276
00:26:29,653 --> 00:26:32,952
What about your mother?

277
00:26:33,023 --> 00:26:37,653
No clue about her.

278
00:26:37,727 --> 00:26:41,823
Don't you want to meet her?

279
00:26:41,898 --> 00:26:46,096
She married again,
moved to Osaka.

280
00:26:48,305 --> 00:26:52,241
Meeting her again
has never crossed my mind.

281
00:26:53,276 --> 00:26:57,736
I never think about her.

282
00:27:00,016 --> 00:27:04,009
My dad and my grandfather
raised me.

283
00:27:05,522 --> 00:27:07,956
But they didn't get along.

284
00:27:25,976 --> 00:27:28,968
I'm researching
about Michel Houellebecq.

285
00:27:29,045 --> 00:27:31,775
I've read his work in translation,

286
00:27:31,848 --> 00:27:34,578
but I'd like to try the originals.

287
00:27:37,387 --> 00:27:39,878
I want to improve my French.

288
00:27:39,956 --> 00:27:44,256
And I want to write a novel.

289
00:27:46,363 --> 00:27:48,854
Which courses do you have
with Mr. Oyama?

290
00:27:48,932 --> 00:27:51,059
Is that what he told you?

291
00:27:51,134 --> 00:27:53,227
Well, yes.

292
00:27:53,303 --> 00:27:55,464
We aren't together in any class.

293
00:27:55,538 --> 00:27:58,473
Then, your clubs are the same?

294
00:27:58,541 --> 00:28:01,533
I'm in the Dance club
and Latin Classics club.

295
00:28:01,611 --> 00:28:02,873
But he...

296
00:28:05,849 --> 00:28:10,309
I was thrilled to have the chance
to talk with you today.

297
00:28:15,225 --> 00:28:19,025
You can tell me about films
and all your experiences.

298
00:28:28,972 --> 00:28:30,735
You could teach me so much...

299
00:28:30,807 --> 00:28:34,038
a man of your capacity.

300
00:28:36,613 --> 00:28:38,342
I'm a little old-fashioned.

301
00:28:38,415 --> 00:28:39,780
I like that.

302
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,351
Sorry.

303
00:28:48,825 --> 00:28:53,194
Oyama used to seem
so mature before.

304
00:28:57,834 --> 00:28:59,631
"Before" you say.

305
00:29:05,175 --> 00:29:06,472
Excuse me.

306
00:29:21,124 --> 00:29:22,557
Okay, rehearsal.

307
00:29:23,593 --> 00:29:26,118
And, action!

308
00:29:26,196 --> 00:29:31,657
My grandfather used to pick me up
from kindergarten.

309
00:29:31,735 --> 00:29:33,202
Not your mother?

310
00:29:33,269 --> 00:29:36,261
She left when I was one and a half.

311
00:29:36,339 --> 00:29:39,206
Sorry, I didn't know.

312
00:29:39,275 --> 00:29:41,505
It's okay. I haven't seen her since.

313
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:50,845
Mr. Oyama.

314
00:29:52,989 --> 00:29:54,547
Sorry.

315
00:30:06,202 --> 00:30:09,330
We're married.

316
00:30:13,443 --> 00:30:14,603
Are you shocked?

317
00:30:15,812 --> 00:30:17,712
Somewhat.

318
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:23,681
I wanted to meet you.

319
00:30:23,753 --> 00:30:26,654
To see you up close.

320
00:30:28,958 --> 00:30:30,323
When did you marry?

321
00:30:32,362 --> 00:30:33,795
Last year.

322
00:30:33,863 --> 00:30:37,355
We were seeing each other
for one and a half years.

323
00:30:37,434 --> 00:30:40,562
He has an olfactory malfunction.

324
00:30:42,338 --> 00:30:43,805
Olfactory malfunction?

325
00:30:46,209 --> 00:30:49,770
I can't smell my food.

326
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:00,046
I make all of his food,
and look after him.

327
00:31:09,365 --> 00:31:11,265
Your marriage is in trouble?

328
00:31:11,334 --> 00:31:12,460
Not in the least.

329
00:31:12,535 --> 00:31:15,936
But he's becoming
more like a student.

330
00:31:16,005 --> 00:31:19,406
I was researching the Middle East.

331
00:31:19,476 --> 00:31:21,808
But recently he's into the supernatural.

332
00:31:21,878 --> 00:31:24,108
It was a natural progression...

333
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:39,958
Our scheme has been uncovered.

334
00:31:40,029 --> 00:31:42,793
We can't hide it now.

335
00:31:42,866 --> 00:31:44,356
I said,

336
00:31:44,434 --> 00:31:46,129
if she could seduce you,

337
00:31:46,202 --> 00:31:48,568
I'd take her to France.

338
00:31:48,638 --> 00:31:53,541
She wants to meet
Michel Houellebecq.

339
00:31:56,246 --> 00:31:57,941
I'd like to see Paris again,

340
00:31:58,014 --> 00:32:00,676
and if we went together, well...

341
00:32:10,093 --> 00:32:14,826
But if you know we're married,
she can't seduce you.

342
00:32:18,034 --> 00:32:19,228
Or could I?

343
00:32:23,139 --> 00:32:24,470
I wonder.

344
00:32:26,743 --> 00:32:28,233
I don't think so.

345
00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:51,048
Takeda!

346
00:33:51,127 --> 00:33:52,094
Terrible news!

347
00:33:55,865 --> 00:33:57,389
Aki has been killed.

348
00:33:57,467 --> 00:34:00,493
A motorbike accident last night.

349
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:04,836
He couldn't make a curve,
and hit a truck head on.

350
00:34:04,907 --> 00:34:06,374
Oh?

351
00:34:08,678 --> 00:34:11,340
The funeral is tonight.
We could go.

352
00:34:11,414 --> 00:34:12,847
I'm not going.

353
00:34:14,751 --> 00:34:19,620
But you were good friends
in class in first grade.

354
00:34:19,689 --> 00:34:25,252
What's the point in twittering
to her friends

355
00:34:25,328 --> 00:34:26,295
at her funeral?

356
00:34:26,362 --> 00:34:29,058
Everyone's going.

357
00:34:31,167 --> 00:34:32,134
I'm not.

358
00:34:33,636 --> 00:34:35,467
Why not? Come on!

359
00:34:35,538 --> 00:34:36,937
Come on!

360
00:34:39,075 --> 00:34:40,269
No, I won't.

361
00:34:41,844 --> 00:34:43,106
I'm not going.

362
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:44,544
Give it more power.

363
00:34:44,614 --> 00:34:45,979
I'm not going!

364
00:34:55,825 --> 00:34:56,792
Look.

365
00:35:08,938 --> 00:35:10,371
You take over.

366
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,874
Come down now, Ikeda.

367
00:35:29,258 --> 00:35:30,225
What the...

368
00:35:31,427 --> 00:35:33,987
My foot!
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

369
00:35:34,063 --> 00:35:35,189
Oh no! Oh no!

370
00:35:36,232 --> 00:35:37,199
Ouch!

371
00:36:11,067 --> 00:36:13,467
Where's the director?

372
00:36:15,938 --> 00:36:17,405
Gone for a piss?

373
00:36:17,473 --> 00:36:20,306
Let's take it from the top.

374
00:36:22,278 --> 00:36:23,973
Come here a minute.

375
00:37:01,284 --> 00:37:02,478
Naoki has fallen!

376
00:37:02,552 --> 00:37:04,247
Over the edge!

377
00:37:06,222 --> 00:37:07,519
Naoki has fallen!

378
00:37:17,633 --> 00:37:18,600
Professor...

379
00:37:23,206 --> 00:37:24,173
Professor!

380
00:37:25,775 --> 00:37:26,742
Professor...

381
00:37:48,764 --> 00:37:51,324
- Professor.
- Professor.

382
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,492
Professor!

383
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:07,679
Old Venice has turned
into Aschenbach.

384
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,709
Professor.

385
00:38:15,491 --> 00:38:18,688
SATURDAY

386
00:38:39,348 --> 00:38:42,442
This the movie web page?

387
00:38:42,518 --> 00:38:44,281
"High drama on movie location

388
00:38:44,353 --> 00:38:48,687
as director miraculously
cheats death in fall.

389
00:38:48,758 --> 00:38:51,625
Shooting delayed.

390
00:38:51,694 --> 00:38:54,561
Future of movie in balance."

391
00:38:57,133 --> 00:39:01,297
Do you think Naoki fell,
or did Yukari push him?

392
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:04,464
Nobody saw,
so we don't know.

393
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:08,169
She really loved him.

394
00:39:22,758 --> 00:39:24,919
Serves Naoki right, I think.

395
00:39:24,994 --> 00:39:28,452
You wouldn't say that if he was dead.

396
00:39:28,531 --> 00:39:30,897
Yes I would, wouldn't I?

397
00:39:30,967 --> 00:39:32,935
How should I know?

398
00:39:37,173 --> 00:39:38,299
I have an announcement.

399
00:39:39,442 --> 00:39:41,672
We went to the police station.

400
00:39:41,744 --> 00:39:43,644
We heard what Yukari had to say.

401
00:39:43,713 --> 00:39:48,912
As she was walking on the edge,
she was contemplating s... s...

402
00:39:48,985 --> 00:39:51,749
Suicide. She was all set to do it
when Naoki arrived.

403
00:39:51,821 --> 00:39:53,220
It only took a moment.

404
00:39:53,289 --> 00:39:57,885
She wanted to see what would happen
if she pushed him.

405
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,656
It was an instant response

406
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:03,426
and she remembers nothing after it.

407
00:40:04,767 --> 00:40:10,228
I wonder if she was normal
at the time.

408
00:40:10,306 --> 00:40:13,969
As opposed to abnormal.

409
00:40:14,043 --> 00:40:15,670
I think...

410
00:40:15,745 --> 00:40:18,805
We'll never know.

411
00:40:20,082 --> 00:40:22,346
If she was normal,
that's abnormal,

412
00:40:22,418 --> 00:40:26,855
and vice versa.

413
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:33,686
But she wanted to try.

414
00:40:33,763 --> 00:40:35,958
Like an experiment.

415
00:40:36,032 --> 00:40:40,992
That's it.
I think I'll experiment too!

416
00:40:42,438 --> 00:40:45,236
You two. I saw you!

417
00:40:45,307 --> 00:40:48,208
I just saw you kissing my Kiyoko.

418
00:40:48,277 --> 00:40:49,574
You bastard!

419
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,745
He's coming!

420
00:40:52,815 --> 00:40:55,477
- Talking to your self...
- I'm scared!

421
00:40:55,551 --> 00:40:56,575
Come here!

422
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:02,089
An experiment.

423
00:41:02,158 --> 00:41:03,648
Like a game!

424
00:41:04,994 --> 00:41:06,052
I'll kill you!

425
00:41:06,128 --> 00:41:08,289
They're here!

426
00:41:08,364 --> 00:41:10,298
It's an experiment!

427
00:41:14,870 --> 00:41:16,064
I'll kill you!

428
00:41:17,573 --> 00:41:18,540
I'll kill you!

429
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:24,910
Cut it out!

430
00:41:26,115 --> 00:41:27,582
Be quiet!

431
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:29,515
Stop fooling around.

432
00:41:29,585 --> 00:41:31,678
We have our meeting
with the professor!

433
00:41:36,892 --> 00:41:40,384
MONDAY

434
00:41:47,503 --> 00:41:48,470
Welcome back.

435
00:41:48,537 --> 00:41:51,973
What's up?

436
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:53,941
That accident?

437
00:41:54,009 --> 00:41:56,341
No.

438
00:42:03,686 --> 00:42:05,586
Is the movie going to go ahead?

439
00:42:05,654 --> 00:42:09,954
It starts tomorrow
with me as the director.

440
00:42:10,025 --> 00:42:12,619
Good for you.

441
00:42:16,932 --> 00:42:20,163
Is something troubling you?

442
00:42:20,236 --> 00:42:23,262
In the new schedule,

443
00:42:23,339 --> 00:42:26,331
the murder scene is first.

444
00:42:28,344 --> 00:42:29,311
I see.

445
00:42:32,782 --> 00:42:34,181
So, what's the other news?

446
00:42:39,522 --> 00:42:41,717
How was the mountain weather?

447
00:42:43,959 --> 00:42:45,449
Excellent.

448
00:42:45,528 --> 00:42:50,090
We had fantastic views
from the summit.

449
00:42:51,734 --> 00:42:53,565
Unbelievably beautiful.

450
00:42:53,636 --> 00:42:58,573
Didn't have any altitude sickness?

451
00:43:00,743 --> 00:43:03,974
Look at me. Fit as a fiddle.

452
00:43:16,258 --> 00:43:17,555
Hiroshi.

453
00:43:21,597 --> 00:43:22,564
You know...

454
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:25,300
What?

455
00:43:28,904 --> 00:43:31,634
While you were
in the mountains,

456
00:43:31,707 --> 00:43:36,201
I kissed two other men.

457
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:44,084
The cinematographer

458
00:43:44,153 --> 00:43:47,213
and the male lead.

459
00:43:55,331 --> 00:43:56,389
Are you angry?

460
00:44:19,488 --> 00:44:24,289
I might give you a smack
after the movie.

461
00:44:27,229 --> 00:44:31,256
I'm really sorry.

462
00:44:33,869 --> 00:44:35,564
I'm sure it meant nothing.

463
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:46,275
It's that damned movie's fault.

464
00:44:47,383 --> 00:44:49,510
You can't blame the film.

465
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:56,182
Two guys, yeah?

466
00:45:05,267 --> 00:45:07,895
I wanted to see how it would be

467
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:11,133
if I kissed them.

468
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:31,257
And how was it?

469
00:45:36,265 --> 00:45:37,960
Horrible.

470
00:45:48,711 --> 00:45:49,871
I'm sorry.

471
00:45:53,983 --> 00:45:55,951
I'll never do it again, really.

472
00:45:56,986 --> 00:45:58,544
I'm really sorry.

473
00:46:12,768 --> 00:46:16,204
TUESDAY

474
00:47:44,393 --> 00:47:47,055
I bet these are two old folks.

475
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:19,209
So I'm going to murder her.

476
00:49:19,288 --> 00:49:20,619
What a shame.

477
00:49:29,264 --> 00:49:30,629
Who are you?

478
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,701
My head!

479
00:49:39,775 --> 00:49:42,335
Please, stop it!

480
00:49:49,051 --> 00:49:50,416
No, no, no!

481
00:49:51,453 --> 00:49:52,420
Help!

482
00:50:11,607 --> 00:50:12,631
Let's roll!

483
00:50:12,708 --> 00:50:14,733
- Stand by for a roll!
- Stand by for a roll!

484
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:18,177
Scene 25, cut 2, track 1.

485
00:50:18,247 --> 00:50:20,647
And, action!

486
00:50:45,507 --> 00:50:46,474
Cut!

487
00:50:48,310 --> 00:50:49,277
Okay!

488
00:50:54,916 --> 00:50:56,577
Next set up!

489
00:51:06,228 --> 00:51:07,855
Help me!

490
00:51:10,932 --> 00:51:12,797
I don't want to die yet!

491
00:51:14,069 --> 00:51:16,799
I don't want to die yet!

492
00:51:23,712 --> 00:51:26,180
Please, don't make any noise.

493
00:51:57,379 --> 00:52:00,212
It's harder than you think to kill.

494
00:52:01,483 --> 00:52:03,883
How can I make her die?

495
00:53:22,364 --> 00:53:25,026
So this is death.

496
00:53:41,616 --> 00:53:45,052
You there?

497
00:53:46,822 --> 00:53:49,723
Hey, you in there?

498
00:53:50,959 --> 00:53:51,926
Cut!

499
00:53:54,863 --> 00:53:56,125
Once more please.

500
00:54:01,803 --> 00:54:06,069
Make sure you center the actor
and pan slowly.

501
00:54:28,163 --> 00:54:29,824
You in there?

502
00:54:31,066 --> 00:54:33,660
Are you there?

503
00:55:26,922 --> 00:55:29,015
Chieko, where are you?

504
00:55:31,359 --> 00:55:32,326
Cut!

505
00:55:34,095 --> 00:55:36,029
That was good.

506
00:55:57,719 --> 00:55:59,209
I have money.

507
00:56:02,290 --> 00:56:05,691
I can give you 100,000.

508
00:56:09,397 --> 00:56:10,830
You're from

509
00:56:10,899 --> 00:56:13,561
Junsei High School, right?

510
00:56:13,635 --> 00:56:17,002
I promise I won't tell
anyone at the school.

511
00:56:17,072 --> 00:56:20,701
School? School?

512
00:56:26,414 --> 00:56:27,608
Chieko!

513
00:56:29,217 --> 00:56:30,241
Chieko!

514
00:56:31,786 --> 00:56:32,946
Chieko!

515
00:56:39,794 --> 00:56:40,761
Where's Chieko?

516
00:56:47,435 --> 00:56:48,868
Chieko!

517
00:56:49,904 --> 00:56:51,838
Chieko...

518
00:57:25,674 --> 00:57:26,698
Cut!

519
00:57:29,411 --> 00:57:30,378
Okay?

520
00:57:30,445 --> 00:57:31,412
Okay.

521
00:57:31,479 --> 00:57:32,776
That's a print!
